# one evening as the sun went down
# and the jungle fire was burning
# down the track came a hobo hikin '
# and he said , boys , i'm not turning
# i'm headed for a land that's far away
# beside the crystal fountains
# so come with me , we'll go and see the big rock candy mountains
# in the big rock candy mountains
# there's a land that's fair and bright
# where the handouts grow on bushes
# and you sleep out every night
# where the boxcars all are empty
# and the sun shines every day
# on the birds and the bees and the cigarette trees
# the lemonade springs where the bluebird sings
# in the big rock candy mountains
# in the big rock candy mountains
# all the cops have wooden legs
# and the bulldogs all have rubber teeth
# and the hens lay soft boiled eggs
# the farmers 'trees are full of fruit
# and the barns are full of hay
# oh , i'm bound to go where there ain't no snow
# where the rain don't fall , the wind don't blow
# in the big rock candy mountains
# in the big rock candy mountains
# you never change your socks
# and the little streams of alcohol
# come a trickling down the rocks
# the brakemen have to tip their hats
# and the railroad bulls are blind
# there's a lake of stew and of whiskey , too
# you can paddle all around 'em in a big canoe
# in the big rock candy mountains ... #
# the jails are made of tin
# and you can walk right out again
# as soon as you are in
# there ain't no short handle shovels
# no axes , saws or picks
# i'm a goin 'to stay where you sleep all day
# where they hung the jerk that invented work
# in the big rock candy mountains
# i'll see you all this comin 'fall
# in the big rock candy mountains #
say , any of you boys smithies?
or if not smithies , trained in the metallurgic arts , before circumstances forced you into a life of wanderin '?
jesus !
can't i count on you people?
sorry , everett .
well , all right .
if we take off through that bayou ... wait a minute !
who elected you leader of this outfit?
i figured it should be the one with the capacity for abstract thought , but if that ain't the consensus , then hell , let's vote .
suits me !
i'm votin 'for yours truly .
well , i'm votin 'for yours truly , too .
ok .
i'm with you fellas .
mind if we join you , old timer?
join me , m'son .
join me .
you work for the railroad , grandpa?
i work for no man .
got a name , do you?
i have no name .
that may be why you had difficulty finding gainful employment .
y'see , in the mart of competitive commerce ...
you seek a great fortune , you three who are now in chains .
you will find a fortune , though it will not be the fortune you seek .
but first ... first you must travel a long and difficult road , a road fraught with peril , mm hmm .
you shall see things ... wonderful to tell .
you shall see a ... a cow ... on the roof of a cotton house , ha .
and , oh , so many startlements .
i cannot tell you how long this road shall be , but fear not the obstacles in your path , for fate has ... vouchsafed your reward .
though the road may wind , yea , your hearts grow weary , still shall ye follow them , even unto your salvation .
no , the treasure's still there , believe me .
but how'd he know about it?
i don't know , delmar .
the blind reputedly possess sensitivities compensating for lack of sight , to the point of developing psychic powers .
clearly , seeing the future falls into that category .
it's not so surprising , then , that one lacking earthly vision ...
he said we wouldn't get the treasure we seek , on account of our obstacles .
what the hell does an ignorant old man know?
jesus , pete .
i told you i buried it myself .
if your cousin still has this farm and shoein 'impedimenta to restore liberty of movement ...
hold it right there !
you men from the bank?
you wash's boy?
yes , sir .
daddy told me to shoot who's ever from the bank .
we ain't from the bank , young fella .
yes , sir .
i'm supposed to shoot folks servin 'papers .
we ain't got no papers , neither .
i nicked the census man .
now , there's a good boy .
is ... is your daddy about?
hello , pete .
who are your friends?
pleased to make your acquaintance , mr hogwallop .
my name's ulysses everett mcgill ...
i'm delmar o'donnel .
how you been , wash?
been what , 12 , 13 years?
yeah ...
i expect you want them chains knocked off .
they foreclosed on cousin bishop .
he hanged hisself a year come may .
and uncle radcliffe?
the anthrax took most of his cows .
the rest don't milk .
he lost a boy to mumps .
where's cora , cousin wash?
couldn't say .
mrs hogwallop up and r u n n o f t.
she must have been lookin 'for answers .
possibly .
good riddance , as far as i'm concerned .
i do miss her cooking , though .
this stew's awful good .
think so?
i slaughtered this horse last tuesday .
i'm afraid she's startin 'to turn .
# you are my sunshine
# my only sunshine
# you make me happy
# when skies are grey
# you'll never know , dear
# how much i love you
# please don't take my sunshine away # 'that winds up the pass the biscuits pappy o'daniel flour hour .

'and remember ,
'when you're fixing to bake a mess of biscuits ,
'use cool , clear water
'and good , pure , pappy o'daniel flour . '
well , guess i'll be turnin 'in .
say , uh , cousin wash ,
i suppose it'd be the acme of foolishness to ask if you had a hair net .
we got a bunch in yon bureau .
mrs hogwallop's , matter of fact .
help yourself .
i won't be needing 'em .
# you are my sunshine
# my only sunshine
# you make me happy
# when skies are grey ... #
all right , boys !
how's my hair?
it's the authorities !
we got you surrounded .
damn , we're in a tight spot .
just come on out and grab at air !
and don't try nothin 'fancy .
your situation is pretty nigh hopeless .
damn !
we're in a tight spot !
what in the sam hill ...?
pete's cousin turned us in .
what the hell you sayin '? !
wash is kin !
sorry , pete !
i know we're kin , but they got this depression on .
i got to do for me and mine .
i'm gonna kill you , judas iscariot hogwallop !
you miserable , horse eatin 'son of a ...
damn !
we're in a tight spot !
damn his eyes !
pa always said , " never trust a hogwallop .
come and get us , coppers !
you leave us no choice but to smoke you out .
we're in a tight spot .
light her up !
hold up !
ain't you ever heard of negotiatin '?
we could talk this thing out .
i hate fire !
you lousy , yella bellied ... pete , we need one voice .
careful with that fire !
light the loft , son .
aah !
i hate fire !
gapped toothed , carpetbaggin ', motherless spawn of hell !
step back .
damn it .
look out .
holy saint christopher !
get away from that , she's liquid fire !
take cover , boys !
it ain't popcorn !
scatter , boys !
god damn it !
get in , boys !
i'm gonna r u n n o f t !
come on , boys , come on !
come on !
what are you doing here?
you ought to be in bed , clump snatcher .
you ain't the boss of me !
you candy butted , car thievin 'sos and sos !
i curse your name !
go back home and mind your pa !
what's the damn problem?
i can get the part from bristol in two weeks .
your pomade .
two weeks?
that don't do me no good .
nearest ford auto man's bristol .
hold on .
i don't want this pomade , i want dapper dan .
i don't carry dapper dan .
i carry fop .
i don't want fop , god damn it !
i'm a dapper dan man !
watch your language , this is a public market .
now , if you want dapper dan , i can have it in a coupla weeks .
ain't this a geographical oddity !
two weeks from everywhere .
forget it .
just a dozen hair nets .
well , didn't look like a one horse town , but try finding a decent hair jelly .
gopher , everett?
no transmission belt for two weeks .
huh?
they dam that river on the 21st .
today is the 17th .
don't i know it .
we got but four days to get to that treasure .
after that , it'll be at the bottom of a lake .
we won't make it walkin '.
right ...
gopher?
but the old tactician's got a plan .
for the transportation , not keeping my coiffure in order .
how's this a plan?
how we gonna get a car?
sell that .
i figure you can only have painful association for wash .
to washington bartholomew hogwallop ,
from his lovin 'cora .
" amor fidel ... is .
it was in his bureau ,
i reckon it'll fetch us enough for a good auto voiture and a little leftover besides .
whoo !
you got light fingers , everett .
gopher?
you miserable little snake .
you stole from my kin !
who was fixin 'to betray us .
you didn't know that at the time .
so i borrowed it till i did know .
that don't make no sense !
a fool seeks logic in the chambers of the heart .
what the hell is that singing?
appears to be some kind of a ... congregation .
care for some gopher?
no , thank you , delmar .
a third of a gopher'd only arouse my appetite without beddin 'her back down .
oh , you can have the whole thing .
me and pete already had one .
we ran across a whole ... gopher ... village .

delmar's been saved .
well , that's it , boys .
i been redeemed .
the preacher done washed away all my sins and transgressions .
it's the straight and narrow from here on out .
and heaven everlasting's my reward .
delmar , what are you on about?
we got bigger fish to fry .
the preacher said all my sins is washed away , including that piggly wiggly i knocked over in yazoo .
you said you was innocent of that .
well , i was lyin '.
and the preacher said that that sin's been washed away , too .
neither god nor man's got nothin 'on me now .
come on in , boys .
the water is fine .
come on , boy .
there , boy .
good doggy .
all right , boys , we got the scent .
the preacher said it absolved us .
for him , not for the law .
i gave you credit for more brains than delmar .
but witnesses seen us redeemed .
that's not the issue , delmar .
even square with the lord , mississippi's hard nosed .
you shoulda joined us , everett .
it couldn'a hurt none .
hell , it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade .
joining you fools in superstition?
thank you , anyway .
and i like the smell of my hair , the pleasin 'odour's half the point .
baptism !
you two are dumber than a bag of hammers .
you're my cross to bear .
pull over , everett .
let's give that coloured boy a lift .
you folks going past tishomingo?
sure , hop in .
how you doin ', son?
name's everett .
these two soggy sons of bitches are pete and delmar .
keep your fingers away from pete's mouth , he ain't eaten for 13 years ,
'cept prison food and greasy horse .
thanks for the lift , sir .
my name's tommy .
tommy johnson .
how you doin ', tommy?
say , i haven't seen a house out here for miles .
why are you out in the middle of nowhere?
i had to be at that crossroads last midnight .
sell my soul to the devil .
ain't it a small world , spiritually speakin '?
pete and delmar just been saved .
i'm the only one still unaffiliated .
it's no laughin 'matter .
what'd the devil give you for it?
well , he taught me to play this here guitar real good .
oh , son , for that you traded your everlasting soul?
well , i wasn't usin 'it .
i've always wondered , what's the devil look like?
well , there are all manner of lesser imps and demons , but satan hisself is red and scaly with a bifurcated tail ,
and he carries a hayfork .
oh , no .
no , sir .
he's white .
as white as you folks .
with empty eyes and a big , hollow voice .
he travelled around with a mean old hound , that's right .
he told you to go to tishomingo?
well , no , sir .
why , that was my idea .
i heard there's a man there , pays folks money to sing into his can .
they say he pays extra if'n you play real good .
tishomingo , huh?
how much he pay?
all right , boys , follow my lead .
hello?
who's the honcho here?
i am .
who are you?
well , sir , i'm jordan rivers , and these are the soggy bottom boys , out of cottonillia , mississippi .
songs of salvation to salve the soul .
uh , we hear that you pay good money to sing into a can .
well , that all depends .
you boys do negro songs?
um ...
well , uh , sir , we are negroes .
all except for our accomp ... accomp ... the fella that plays the guitar .
yeah , well , i don't record negro songs .
no , i'm lookin 'for some old timey material .
people can't seem to get enough since we started broadcasting it on the pappy o'daniel flour hour , so thank you for stopping by , but ...
sir , the soggy bottom boys have been steeped in old timey material .
heck , we're silly with it .
that's right .
right .
we ain't really negroes .
all except for our accompanist .

slap that money on the barrel head and buy back the family farm .
you ain't no kind of man if you ain't got land .
what about you , everett?
what you have in mind when you stole it in the first place?
ahem .
i ... didn't have no plan .
well , that hardly sounds like you .
all right , boys !
it's the authorities !
your situation is purty nigh hopeless !
damn , they found our car .
we ain't got the time and nary the inclination to chat with you boys any further .
damn , we got to skedaddle .
i left my pomade in the car .
maybe i can creep up .
don't be a fool , everett .
we got to r u n n o f t.
where's tommy?
already lit out , scared out of his wits .
let's go !
well , hell , it ain't square one .
ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy , unshaved hitchhikers .
and one of them a know it all who can't keep his trap shut .
the rancour reflected in that remark i won't dignify with comment .
but i'll address your general attitude of hopeless negativism .
consider the lilies of the goddam field .
or , hell , look at delmar as your paradigm of hope .
yeah .
look at me .
you may call it unreasoning optimism , you may call it obtuse , but the plain and simple fact is we got close to ... three days before they ...
.. dam that river .
is this the road to itta bena?
uh ... itta bena?
itta bena?
stay on this here road .
that ain't right , i was thinking of , uh ...
take this road .
nah , that ain't right .
seems to me there's a road ...
cow road that used to lead all the way ...
well , most of the way ...
er , that ain't right , either .
hop in while you give it a think .
right .
delmar .
any of you boys know your way around a walther ppk?
well , we can't help .
i don't believe it's in mississippi .

i'm takin 'off .
you boys might as well keep my ... share of the riches .
well , where are you going , george?
i don't know .
who cares?
now , what do you suppose is eatin 'george?
well , they say that with the thrill seeking personality , what goes up must come down .
top of the world one minute , sad the next .
yes , sir , it's as if our old friend george is a alley cat and his own damn humours are swingin 'him by the tail .
i wouldn't worry , delmar .
he'll be back on top again .
i don't think we've seen the last of george nelson .

them sirens did this to pete .
they loved him up and turned him into a ... horny toad .
pete !
pete !
pete !
pete !
pete !
pete !
pete !
pete , it's me ... delmar .
it's me ... delmar .
everett .
delmar , what the ...? !
what are we gonna do? !
i'm not sure that's pete .
of course it's pete .
look at him .
we got to find some kind of ... wizard can change him back .
i'm just not sure that's pete .
you can't display a toad in a fine restaurant .
folks'd go off their feed .
hey .
i just don't think it's right keeping him under wraps
like we was ashamed of him .
if it is pete , i am ashamed of him .
he got what he deserved , fornicatin 'with some whore of babylon .
these things don't happen for no reason .
it's a judgment on pete's character .
well , the two of us was fixin 'to fornicate .
you'll have to excuse my rusticated friend , unaccustomed as he is to city manners .
hmm?
i guess we'll have a couple of steaks and some , uh , gratine potatoes , and wash it down with your finest bubbly wine .
oh , i don't suppose you have any ...
maybe the chef could prepare ...
just bring us a couple of leaves of raw cabbage .
yes , sir .
thank you .
i don't believe i've seen you boys .
allow me to introduce myself .
name of daniel teague , known around here as big dan teague ,
or , pressed for time , big dan !
tout court !
name's ulysses everett mcgill .
my associate , delmar o'donnel .
i detect , like me , you're endowed with the gift of gab .
i flatter myself such is the case .
in my line , it's plum necessary .
the one thing you don't want ... is air in the conversation .
again we agree .
what kind of work you do , big dan?
sales , mr mcgill , sales !
what do i sell?
the truth , every blessed word of it .
from genesis down to revelations .
yes , the word of god , which , let me say , there's damn good money in during these times of woe and want .
people want answers , and big dan sells the only book that's got 'em .
and what do you do , you and your , uh , tongue tied friend?
we , uh ...
we're adventurers , sir , pursuing an opportunity , but we're open to others as well .
i like you .
i'm gonna propose you a proposition .
you cover my bill for now , get your dinner wrapped picnic style and we'll retire to more private environs , where i'll reveal how to make vast amounts of money in the service of god almighty .
well , why not?
i can use some civilised conversation .
don't forget your shoe box , friend .
damn shame !
goddam campaign is lagging !
we need a shot in the arm .
hear me , boys?
in the goddam arm !
election held tomorrow , that sumbitch stokes would win in a walk !
he's the reform candidate , daddy .
yeah?
a lot of people like that reform .
maybe we should get us some .
i'll reform you , you soft headed son of a bitch .
how we gonna run reform?
we're the incumbent !
is that the best you can come up with?
reform? !
weepin 'jesus on the cross .
that's it !
start drafting my concession speech right now .
ok , pappy .
i'm just making a point , you stupid son'bitch .
give me back that hat !
pappy's just makin 'a point .
shut up !
thank you for that fricassee .
i'm a man of large appetites .
even with lunch under my belt , i was a mite peckish .
our pleasure .
thank you as well for the conversational hiatus .
i generally refrain from speech during gustation .
there are those who attempt both at the same time .
i find it coarse and vulgar .
where were we?
making money in the lord's service .
friend , when you do speak , it's to the point and i salute you .
yes , bible sales .
the trade is not complicated .
there are two things to learn ...
one , find a wholesaler , the word of god in bulk , as it were .
two , recognise your customer .
who are you dealing with?
it's an exercise in psychology , so to speak .
and it is that which i propose to give you a lesson in right now .
i like to think i'm an astute observer of the human scene , too .
no doubt , brother .
i figured as much at the restaurant .
that's why i invited you all out here for this advanced tutorial .
what's going on , big dan?
it's all about the money , boys !
that's it !
gol ... durned ... money !
i don't get it .
raah !
i'll just take your show cards .
yaah !
and whatever you got in the hole .
what the ... there ain't nothin 'but a damn toad .
no , you don't understand .
that's pete .
pete .
you know these give you warts?
end of lesson .
so long , boys .
hee hee hee !
see you in the funny papers .
y'all seen the end of big dan teague .
where are they?
talk , you unreconstructed whelp of a whore !
where they headed?
aah !
your screams won't save your flesh .
aah !
only your tongue is , boy .
where they headed?
aah !
whoa , hound .
sweet summer rain .
like god's own mercy .
your two friends have abandoned you , pete .
they don't seem to care about your hide .
ok .
stairway to heaven , pete .
we shall all meet by and by .
god damn it !
god forgive me !
hold .
believe me , delmar , he would have wanted us to press on .
pete , rest his soul , was one sourass son of a bitch and not given to pointless sentimentality .
it don't seem right getting the treasure without him .
maybe it's for the best he was squished .
why , he ... was barely a sentient being and ... when we clean up and get a little smellum in our hair , we're gonna feel 100 % better about ourselves and about ... life in general .
must be near parchment farm .
sorry sons of bitches .
seems like a year ago we busted off the farm .
pete got a brother?
not that i'm aware .
heat must be getting to me .
# oh , the storm and its fury raged today
# crushing hope that we cherished so dear
# the cloud and storm will in time pass away
# and the sun again will shine bright and clear
# keep on the sunny side
# always on the sunny side
# keep on the sunny side of life
# it will help us every day
# it will brighten all the way
# if we'll keep on the sunny side of life
# if we'll keep on the sunny side of life #
that was wonderful .
that sure was .
yes .
now , i know the sunnysiders would agree with me when i say that the great state of mississippi cannot afford four more years of pappy o'daniel !
four more years of cronyism !
nepotism !
rascalism !
of service to the interests !
now , the choice , she's a clear 'un .
pappy o'daniel , slave of the interests ...
homer stokes , servant of the little man .
right , little fella?
he ain't lyin '!
ladies and gentlemen , the little man has admonished me to grasp the broom of reform and sweep this state clean !
it's gonna be , " back to the flour mill , pappy !
the interests can handle themselves !

whoa , whoa , whoa !
you can't swear at my fiancee !
oh , yeah?
well , you can't marry my wife !
who is that man?
he's not my husband .
just a drifter , i guess .
just some no account drifter .
and stay out of the woolsworth !
'i'll bet she does imitations , too . '
deceitful , two faced she wolf .
never trust a female , delmar .
remember that precept and your time with me won't have been ill spent .
ok , everett .
" hit by a train .
truth means nothing to a woman , delmar .
triumph of the subjective .
you ever been with a woman?
well , i've ...
i got to get the family farm back before i can start thinking about that .
that's right .
if then .
believe me , a woman's the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days of man .
everett , i never figured you for a pater familias .
ohh , yes .
i have spread my seed .
and look what it's ...  god damn it .
what the hell ...?
ok , boys .
enjoy your picture show .
# i have no money , honey
# how can i change?
do ... not ... seek the treasure .
do not ... seek the treasure .
it's a bushwhack .
they're fixin 'an ambush .
do not seek the treasure .
we ... we thought you was ... a toad .
we ... thought ... you ... was ... a ... toad .
do not seek the treasure .
quiet there !
watch the picture !
i signed that bill .
i signed a dozen agriculture bills .
everyone knows i'm a friend of the farmer .
what i gotta do , start diddling livestock?
we can't do that , daddy .
we might offend our constituency .
we ain't got a constituency !
stokes got a constituency !
well , it's a well run campaign .
midget and broom and whatnot .
devil his due .
hell of an organisation .
say , i got an idea .
what's that , junior?
we can hire us a little fella even smaller than stokes's .
you slump shouldered sack of nuts !
we'd look like a bunch of johnny come latelys bringin 'out our own midget .
don't matter how stumpy !
that's the goddam problem , people think stokes has got fresh ideas .
he's au courant and we're the past !
it's a problem of ...
perception .
right .
he's pulling our pants down .
gonna paddle some behind .
ain't gonna paddle it .
gonna kick it .
no , he's gonna paddle it .
that's not a proper description .
that's how i'd characterise it .
it's more of a kickin 'situation .
god ...
god forgive me .
i could not gaze upon that fireshow .
pete .
hold still !
can't ... stand much longer .
it was ... it was a mo moment of weakness .
quit babblin ', we gotta skedaddle .
that's all i got .
they lured me out for a bathe and then they dunked me , trussed me up like a hog , and turned me in for the bounty .
shoulda guessed it .
typical womanly behaviour .
we're lucky we left before they came back .
we didn't abandon you , pete .
we just thought you was a toad .
no , they never did turn me into a toad .
well , that was our mistake , then .
we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from woolworths .
everett , was it the one branch or all of them?
well , i ain't had it easy , either , boys .
frankly , uh , well , i ...
i spilt my guts about the treasure .
huh?
i'm awful sorry i betrayed you , fellas .
must be my hogwallop blood .
that's all right , pete .
awful white of you to take it like that , everett .
i feel wretched .
spoiling your play for a million dollar point two .
you should rip out my guts .
no , that's all right .
you boys are true friends !
ohh !
you're my beaucoup friends .
pete , i don't want you to beat yourself up about this , eh?
i can't help it , but that's a ... a wonderful thing to say .
yeah .
pete , uh ...
well , fact of the matter is ...
damn it ...
there ain't no treasure .
fact of the matter is there never was .
but ...
so where's all the money from the armoured car job?
i never knocked over no armoured car .
i was sent up for practising law without a license .
but ...
i had to bust out .
my wife wrote me she was getting married , i gotta stop it .
i had two weeks left on my sentence .
i couldn't wait , wedding's tomorrow .
my added time for the escape , i don't get out now till 19 ... 87 .
i am sorry about that .
i'll be ... 84 years old .
i guess they'll tack on 50 years for me , too .
boys , we was chained together .
i had to tell you something .
busting out alone was not an option .
i'm sorry .
84 years old .
well , i'll only be 82 .
you !
you ruined my life !
you ruined my life !
i do apologise , pete .
84 years old !
i'm becoming papillon !
delmar !

we have all gathered here to preserve our hallowed culture and heritage from intrusion , inclusion and dilution of colour , of creed , and of our old time religion .
we aim to pull evil up by the root before it chokes out the flower of our culture and heritage .
and our women , let's not forget those ladies , y'all ,
looking to us for protection from darkies , from jews , from papists , and from all those smart ass folks say we come descended from monkeys .
that's not my culture and heritage .
yes !
is it yours?
no !
and so ... we gonna hang us a negro .
hooray !
i ain't never harmed you , neither of you gentlemen .
uh ...
mm hmm .
i ain't never harmed nobody .
hey , hey , tommy .

tommy , we come to rescue you .
that's mighty kind of you boys , but i don't think nothing's going to save me now .
the devil's come to collect his due .
don't be crazy , tommy .
you don't wanna get hanged .
well , naw , i don't reckon i do , but that's the way it's working out .
tommy , i got a plan .

vernon t waldrip .
hmm .
it's invitation only .
we'll have to sneak in .
hold on .
wait a minute .
who elected you leader of this outfit?
since we've been following your lead , we got nothing but trouble .
i've gotten this close to being strung up and consumed in a fire and whipped no end and sunstroked and soggied .
and turned into a frog .
he wasn't turned into a frog .
almost loved up , though .
so , you're against me now , too?
is that how it is , boys?
the whole world and god almighty ... now you?
i guess i deserve it .
boys ...
i know that i made some tactical mistakes , but if you just stick with me , i got a plan .
believe me , we can fix this thing .
i'll get my wife back , we'll leave .
goddam disgrace !
made a travesty of the entire evening .
ohh !
what i wouldn't give to get a hold of those agitators .
whoever heard of such behaviour , even amongst the coloured?
mulattos , maybe .
i suspect some miscegenation in their heritage .
using a confederate flag as a missile !
crazy !
no one's ever gonna believe we're a real band .
i just gotta get close enough to talk to her .
comin 'with us got more future than marrying a guy called waldrip .

ladies and gentlemans , here and listening at home , the great state of mississippi ...
pappy o'daniel , governor ... wants to thank the soggy bottom boys for that wonderful performance .
and it looks like the only man in this great state who ain't a music lover is my esteemed opponent in the upcoming , homer stokes .
there ain't no accounting for taste .
sounded to me like he was harbouring a hateful grudge against the soggy bottom boys on account of their rough and rowdy past .
looks like homer stokes is the kind of fellow who wants to cast the first stone .
well , i'm with you , folks .
i'm a forgive and forget christian , and i say ... if their rambunctiousness and misdemeanoring is behind them ...
it is , ain't it?
yes , sir , it is .
well , then , i say , by the power vested in me , these boys is hereby pardoned !
and furthermore ... in the second pappy o'daniel administration , these boys is gonna be my brain trust !
what's that mean , everett?
well , it means you and me and pete and tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne , so to speak .
oh , ok .
so , without further ado , and by way of endorsing my candidacy , the soggy bottom boys is gonna lead us all in a chorus of " you are my sunshine " .
ain't you , boys?
one of our favourites .
son ... you're gonna go far .
# you are my sunshine
# my only sunshine
# you make me happy
# when skies are grey
# you'll never know , dear
# how much i love you
# please don't take
# my sunshine away #
i guess vernon t waldrip is gonna be going on relief .
maybe i can throw a little patronage his way , get him a job digging or rounding up stray dogs .
so , is the marriage off , miss wharvey?
mcgill .
no .
the marriage will take place as planned .
with a change of cast .
me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces and re tie the knot , mixaphorically speaking .
you boys are invited , of course .
hell , you're the best men .
i already got the rings .
where's your ring?
i ain't worn it since our divorce .
must still be in the roll top in the old cabin .
vernon's was encrusted with jewels .
now's the time to buy it off him cheap .
we ain't getting married with his ring .
you said you'd changed .
just an old pewter thing .
ain't no wedding .
it's just a symbol , honey .
no wedding .
we'll fetch it with you .
it's just ...
shut up , delmar .
it's just a symbol .
i've spoken my piece and counted to three .
she counted to three .
god damn it .
she counted to three .
son of a bitch !
you have any idea how far that cabin is?
george?
hello , boys !
these little men finally caught the criminal of the century .
looks like the chair for george nelson !
yup , gonna electrify me .
i'm gonna go off like a roman candle !
20, 000 volts chasing a rabbit through yours truly !
gonna suck all the power right out of the state !
gonna shoot sparks out of my head and lightning from my fingertips !
i'm george nelson , and i'm feeling ten feet tall !
looks like george is right back on top again .
cow killer !
well , at least you boys get to see the ancestral manse , the home where i spent so many a happy day in the bosom of my family refugin ', if you will , with a mighty oak tree out front and a happy little tyre swing on it .
where's the happy little tyre swing?
end of the road , boys .
no .
wait a minute .
let's go , boys .
it's had its twists and turns , now it deposits you here .
wait a minute .
you have eluded fate and you have eluded me for the last time .
tie their hands , boys .
you can't do this , now .
didn't know you'd be bringing a friend .
he'll just have to wait his turn , share one of your graves .
you can't do it , we just got pardoned by the governor .
it went out on the radio .
is that right?
well , we ain't got a radio .
god have mercy .
# you

ahh .
a miracle .
it was a miracle !
delmar , don't be ignorant .
i told you they was flooding this valley .
no !
that ain't it !
we prayed to god and he pitied us !
well , it never fails .
again , you hayseeds are showin 'you want for intellect .
there's a perfectly scientific explanation .
that ain't the tune you was singin 'back at the gallows !
any human being'll cast about in a moment of stress .
no , they're flooding this valley so they can hydroelectric up the whole darn state .
yes , sir , the south is gonna change .
everything's gonna run on a paying basis .
out with the spiritual mumbo jumbo and the backward ways .
we're gonna see a brave new world where they hook us all up to a grid .
yes , a veritable age of reason .
like the one they had in france .
not a moment too soon .
not a moment too soon .
hey , there's tommy .
tommy , what you ridin 'there?

# my latest sun is sinking fast
# my race is nearly run ... #
all's well that ends well , " some poet said .
that's right , honey .
don't mind telling you i'm awful pleased my adventuring days have come to an end .
time for this old boy to enjoy some repose .
that's good , honey .
you were right about that ring , too .
any other wedding band wouldn't do .
this here was fore ordained .
fate was a smilin 'on me .
that's not my ring .
what?
not your ring?
that's one of aunt herlene's .
you said it was in the roll top .
i said i thought it was .
no , you said ...
or under the mattress .
or maybe in my chifforobe .
well , i'm sorry , honey .
we need that ring .
it's at the bottom of a durn big lake .
uh uh .
a 9, 000 hectare lake .
i don't care if it's 90, 000 .
that lake was not my doing .
i've counted to three .
no , wait , honey .
finding one ring in the middle of all that water
is one hell of a heroic task ! # .. and gives me victory
# o , come , angel band
# come and
# around me stand
# o , bear me away on your snow white wings
# to my immortal home
# o , bear me away on your snow white wings
# to my immortal home #
# my latest sun is sinking fast
# my race is nearly run
# my strongest trials now are past
# my triumph has begun
# o , come
# angel band
# come and around me stand
# o , bear me away on your snow white wings
# to my immortal home
# o , bear me away on your snow white wings

# always on the sunny side
# keep on the sunny side of life
# it will help us every day
# it will brighten all the way
