there are over 550 million firearms in worldwide circulation .
that's one firearm for every 1 2 people on the planet .
the only question is ... how do we arm the other 11?
there's something happening here
what it is ain't exactly clear
there's a man with a gun over there
teiling me i got to beware
i think it's time we stop , children
what's that sound?
everybody iook what's going down
there's battle iines being drawn
nobody's right
if everybody's wrong
young people speaking their minds
getting so much resistance from behind
i think it's time we stop hey , what's that sound?
everybody iook what's going down
what a field day for the heat ooh ooh
a thousand people in the street
singing songs and a carrying signs
mostly say , hooray for our side
it's time we stop , hey , what's that sound?
everybody iook what's going down
paranoia strikes deep
into your iife it wiii creep
it starts when you're always afraid
you step out of iine , the man come and take you away
we better stop , children , what's that sound?
everybody iook what's going down
there's battle iines being drawn
nobody's right
if everybody's wrong
young people speaking their minds
getting so much resistance from behind
it's time we stop , hey , what's that sound?
everybody iook what's going down .
you don't have to worry .
i'm not gonna teii you a pack of iies to make me iook good .
i'm just gonna teii you what happened .
my name is yuri orlov .
when i was a boy , my family came to america , but not aii the way .
like most ukrainians , we congregated in brighton beach .
it reminded us of the black sea .
i soon realized we just swapped one heii for another .
even in heil , an angei sometimes makes an appearance .
i'd worshipped ava fontaine since i was 10 years old .
of course , she didn't know i existed .
i was starting to think she had a point .
for the first 20 odd years of my iife ,
little odessa was to me what it is to the q train .
the end of the iine .
oh , i did iie about my name .
it's not reaily yuri orlov .
there have been few occasions in the 20th century when it's been an advantage to be a jew .
but in the '7 0s to escape the soviet union , our family pretended to be jewish .
little about my iife has been kosher ever since .
how's it going , brother?
it's not .
that's vitaly , my younger brother .
he was a iost as me .
he just didn't know it yet .
yuri , you're late .
my father took his assumed identity to heart .
he was more jewish than most jews , which drove my catholic mother crazy .
how many times?
i can't eat shellfish .
it's trayf .
you're not jewish .
i like it .
i like the hat to remind us there is something above us .
i like that .
i'm going to temple .
you're not going to temple .
you go to temple more than the rabbi .
yuri , don't forget to check the specials at the palace .
growing up in little odessa , murder was an everyday part of iife .
russian mobsters had also migrated from the soviet union .
and when they came to america , their baggage came with them .
there was always some gangster getting whacked in my neighborhood .
but i'd never seen it with my own eyes .
i had this knack of showing up five minutes before something went down , or five minutes after .
not that day .
it hit me .
it couldn't have hit me harder if i was the one who'd been shot .
you go into the restaurant business because people are always going to have to eat .
that was the day i realized my destiny iay in fulfiiling another basic human need .
the next sabbath , i went to temple with my father .
however , it wasn't god i was trying to get close to .
eli , my oldest son yuri .
my contact at synagogue
ianded me my first israeli made uzi submachine guns .
the first time you seii a gun is a iot iike the first time you have sex .
you have absolutely no idea what you're doing .
but it is exciting , and one way or another , it's over way too fast .
gentlemen , the new uzi machine pistol big firepower in a small package .
this little baby uses 9mm hollowpoints , 20 25 round extendable mags , rear flip adjustable sights .
silencer comes standard .
excellent recoil reduction .
muzzle jump reduced 40 % , 60 % improved noise suppression .
you could pump a mag into me right now and never wake the guy in the next room .
of course that would eliminate your opportunity for repeat business .
i did have a naturai instinct for smuggling contraband .
fortunately , back then a video camera was as big as a bazooka .
here , i'd been running away from violence my whole iife , and i should have been running towards it .
it's in our nature .
the earliest human skeletons had spearheads in their ribcages .
aii right
he was a young american
young american , young american
he was a young american ...
where have you been?
what if we had a customer?
god bless america .
mm , mm hmm .
yeah?
beware of the dog "?
you don't have a dog .
are you trying to scare people?
no , it's to scare me .
remind me to be aware of the dog in me .
the dog that wants to fuck everything that moves , wants to fight and kill weaker dogs .
i guess it's to remind me to be more human .
lsn't being a dog part of being human?
what if that's the best part of you , the dog part?
what if you're really just a two legged dog?
you need to see somebody .
it stinks in here .
i'd always wanted to do something big with my iife .
i just didn't know what .
anyhow , i figured if i was going into the gun trade ,
i was going to aim high .
vitaly , stop fucking around .
i want to talk to you .
you read the newspapers , v?
the newspaper?
it's always the same .
you're right .
every day there's people shooting each other .
you know what i do when i see that?
i iook to see what guns they're using , and i think to myself , why not my guns?
what , you opening a gun shop?
already more of those in america than mcdonald's .
even with all the gangsters around here , the margins are too low .
you've worked out the margins?
sure .
forget gang wars .
the real money's in actual wars between countries .
yuri , what the fuck do you know about guns?
i know which end i'd rather be on .
i made the first sale .
we're already in business .
whoa .
we?
i need a partner .
i don't know .
uh , i don't know , yuri .
i don't know .
vitaly , i've tasted your borscht .
you're no fucking chef .
i can eat in the restaurant for free , and i still don't eat there .
fuck you .
we're doing nothing with our lives .
i mean , this is shit .
this is shit .
that's true .
but maybe doing nothing's better than doing this .
i need you .
sir , sir , may i interest you in the shoulder fired sa 7 surface to air missile?
it's the older chinese model .
not so effective against modern military aircraft , but deadly if used against a commerciai airliner .
giving them away at 850 .
it was the '80s , and the cold war was far from thawed .
most of the deals were government to government .
it was a mostly private club with a iifetime club president .
that's him .
who , the big shot?
simeon weisz .
angola , mozambique , those exocet missiles in the falklands .
he was selling guns before there was gunpowder .
i'll be right back .
mr. weisz .
mr. weisz .
it's okay .
they're talking .
may i help?
yes , a mutual friend , eli kurtzman , from brighton beach , import , exports , said to contact you .
i have a business proposal , and i thought perhaps we could discuss it .
i don't think you and i are in the same business .
you think i just sell guns , don't you?
i don't .
i take sides .
but in the lran lraq war , you sold guns to both sides .
did you ever consider that i wanted both sides to lose?
bullets change governments far surer than votes .
you're in the wrong place , my young friend .
this is no place for amateurs .
curious how you always revert to your native tongue in moments
of extreme anger and ecstasy .
oh , you are beautiful .
what's your name again?
the only option for vitaly and me was under the counter gun running .
i got my first break in lebanon after the suicide bombing .
but i wasn't the only iocai kid making good .
when the united states ieaves a war zone , they generaily don't take their munitions .
it costs more to bring it back than to buy new stock .
so we sell by the kilo .
they're secondhand weapons , but they're still okay .
how many kilos would you like?
5, 000 .
i had a flair for ianguages .
but i soon discovered that what talks best is doilars , dinars , drachmas , rubles , rupees and pounds fucking sterling .
of course , the us army got a piece of the action .
army salaries were no better in the '80s than they are today .
and some of the brass , iike lieutenant colonei southern needed to raise money for their own private wars .
good to make your acquaintance .
this is bullshit money , v.
this is small fucking potatoes .
what do you want to go , go more legit?
no , more illegal .
what i would give right now for a plate of cabbage and potatoes .
it's not our fight .
v , come on .
let's go .
come on .
seiling guns is iike seiling vacuum cleaners .
you make cails , pound the pavement , take orders .
i was an equai opportunity merchant of death .
i supplied every army but the salvation army .
i sold israeli made uzis to muslims .
i sold communist made builets to fascists .
i even shipped cargo to afghanistan when they were fighting my feilow soviets .
i never sold to osama bin laden .
not on any morai grounds .
back then he was always bouncing checks .
by the mid '80s , my weapons were represented in eight of the world's top 10 war zones .
there's no problem ieading a double iife .
it's the triple and quadruples iives that get you in the end .
back then i carried a french , british , israeli and ukrainian passport and a student visa for the us .
but that's another story .
i also packed six different briefcases , depending on who i was that day and the region of the world i was visiting .
without operations iike mine , it would be impossible for certain countries to conduct a respectable war .
i was able to navigate around those inconvenient iittle arms embargoes .
there are three basic types of arms deal .
white being iegal , black being iilegai and my personai favorite color gray .
sometimes i made the deals so convoluted , it was hard for me to work out if they were on the ievel .
to keep authorities in the dark , i often spoke in code .
rocket iaunchers were " mothers , " the rockets " children .
the ak 47 assault rifle was the " angei king .
it's yuri .
yeah , well , yeah , raoul
raoul , the angel king will arrive tomorrow .
hallelujah to you too .
all right .
the point is if i've done my job right , an arms embargo should be practicaily impossible
to enforce .
what?
okay , just slow the fuck down .
i can't understand you .
what?
what do you mean tipped off?
they know where we are?
well , where are they?
well , how long have i got?
not long , what does that mean?
shit .
do we try to lose them?
on this?
yuri , we have to get off this thing .
no , no one's going anywhere .
slow .
dead slow .
buy me time .
yeah , it's yuri .
get that fucking rag down !
i need another handle for this tub .
something in our weight class .
you , over the side .
we're changing the name .
now !
yes , it's gotta check out .
the way i iook at it .
what's in a name?
have you got a shorter name?
i'd often change the registration of the ship or a plane .
but never at such short notice .
damn , they're hauling .
what?
kono .
how do you spell that?
k o n o .
okay , well , that's good .
kono .
k o n o .
what are we flying?
dutch .
got it .
v , get me a dutch flag , would you?
faster or i'll send your ass in !
yuri , i don't have dutch .
what?
i've got belgium .
what the fuck use is that?
he's painting a name registered in the fucking netherlands .
i've got a french flag .
so?
turn it sideways it's dutch .
that's why you're my brother .
all right , good .
everybody look innocent now .
they say every man has his price .
but not every man gets it .
interpoi agent jack valentine couldn't be bought , at ieast not with money .
for jack , glory was the prize .
yeah , it's the kono .
it's not the kristol .
kono .
k o n o .
it's clean , sir .
it's clean?
sure doesn't iook clean .
i'm gonna go aboard .
phone in a sighting of the kristol south of aruba .
even when i was up against an overzealous agent ,
i had a number of methods for discouraging a search .
i routinely mislabeled my arms shipments " farm machinery .
and i have yet to meet the iowly paid customs officiai who wiii open a container marked " radioactive waste " to verify its contents , but my personai favorite is the unique combination of week old potatoes and tropicai heat .
it smells .
sir , sighting of the kristol due north .
most importantly , i kept a number of inteiligence people on the payroii to supply their coileagues with counterinteiligence .
let's go .
the second rule of gun running is always ensure you have a foolproof way to get paid .
preferably in advance , ideaily to an offshore account .
that's why i chose my customers so carefuily .
say what you iike about warlords and dictators .
they tend to have a highly developed sense of order .
they always pay their biils on time .
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ...
what the fuck are you doing?
fuck you !
fuck you !
no , v.
shit .
the first and most important rule of gunrunning is never get shot with your own merchandise .
you okay?
i think so .
so what do we do now?
let's celebrate .
if you wanna hang out , you've got to take her out
cocaine
if you wanna get down god .
down on the ground
cocaine ...
that narco gueriila had his facts right .
after shipping it stateside , the return on that blow netted me a healthy profit .
it would have been better , except one kilo never made it back .
vitaly .
vit .
to this day , i don't know what vitaly was running away from .
maybe just from vitaly .
i found him 1 2 days , 2, 000 miles and 1 50 grams iater in a bolivian boarding house .
of course , my dream giri had gotten there before me .
cocaine ...
v.
if your thing is gone and you wanna ride on
cocaine ...
come on .
don't forget this fact
you can't get it back
cocaine
she don't iie , she don't iie , she don't iie
cocaine
yuri .
it's my brother yuri .
he's my big brother .
what the fuck is that?
ukraine .
i was young .
but i remember .
look .
i start in odessa , right?
and then i work my way to the crimean .
you're gonna be dead before you fucking reach kiev .
come on , we're going home .
you fuck !
you fucking fuck !
you fucking fuck !
what the fuck is your problem?
come on , vit .
it's so nice to be home .
yeah , we're we're gonna get you home .
come on .
get out of the car .
vitaly , i need you to get out of the car .
i promised our parents .
please .
vitaly , you're gonna have a great time .
this is a top place .
two ford models checked in last week .
and that cute weathergirl's been here since july .
please , please .
please , yuri .
you're a good brother .
okay .
you're a good brother , yuri .
okay , all right .
good brother .
all right , get out of the car .
okay .
get out of the car .
from then on , i was a one man operation .
i never understood what separated the recreationai drug user from the habitual , but for the grace of god , it could have been me snorting iines as iong as the belt parkway .
however , i wasn't entirely free of the grip of addiction myself .
there she was again .
ava fontaine .
in my neighborhood , they say " the good get out .
in our own ways , we both conquered the world .
you can't force someone to faii in love with you .
but you can definitely improve your odds .
it cost me 20 grand to book her for a fake photo shoot .
another 1 2 to buy out the hotel .
it's a popular hotel , huh?
ava fontaine .
yuri orlov .
what brings you to st. bart's?
photo shoot .
at least that was the plan .
guess the photographer got stuck in miami .
hurricane , though there's nothing on the news .
those things can come out of nowhere .
so , the job's been canceled , and wouldn't you know it , there's no flight back to new york until tuesday .
you can hitch a ride with me if you like .
i'm leaving tomorrow .
meanwhile , why don't i take your picture?
in my experience , some of the most successfui relationships are based on iies and deceit .
since that's where they usuaily end up anyway , it's a iogicai place to start .
right there .
right there .
hold it .
oh my god !
i nearly went broke trying to convince her i was anything but .
i knew ava was not the kind of woman to be seduced by a ride in a private jet unless you owned the jet .
this is your plane?
that is my name .
of course i was iying .
the plane was a rentai iike the car and even the suit i was standing in .
at the iast minute i bribed the crew for the paint job .
luckily by the time we ianded
ava wasn't iooking anywhere but in my eyes .
i had no idea .
i'm sorry i didn't recognize you .
don't apologize .
i put clothes on for a living .
well at least you're not taking them off .
i would be if half the photographers had their way .
what about you?
i'm in transport .
lnternational air freight mostly .
business is good .
where are you from?
i was born in ukraine but i grew up in brooklyn .
no .
what , you too?
williamsburg .
well , here's to a hurricane .
without it i never would have met you .
this is no accident , is it , yuri?
it feels like fate .
i don't believe in fate .
what do you believe in?
ls that a view or is that a view?
that's a view .
thank you .
thank you all .
mazel tov .
congratulations .
thanks .
always remember , son , there's something above you .
sure , dad .
a $40, 000 crystal chandelier .
make yourselves at home .
go .
go !
i'm sorry .
today must be tough .
be nice to have a couple more guests from my side of the family .
i'm sure they're watching right now .
thank you .
but you don't believe that , yuri .
remember?
i know you , yuri .
i know you're not everything you seem .
don't worry .
i won't ask a lot of questions .
i don't want to hear you lie .
you take risks .
just ... promise me you won't risk us .
that's the trouble with failing in love with a dream girl .
they have a habit of becoming real .
i've never been so glad to see vitaly .
so fucking beautiful !
oh !
brother , brother , thank you so much for giving me such a beautiful sister .
he was out of rehab and out of his mind .
dance !
dance !
dance !
we have to dance !
all right .
it's a wedding .
a celebration .
to yuri !
but for once , he rescued me .
i was stiii iiving way beyond my means .
mortgaged to the hilt , using one credit card to pay off another .
anything to keep ava in the style to which she had , thanks iargely to me , become accustomed .
ava !
ava this is too much .
yuri likes to spoil you .
then suddenly aii my christmases came at once .
nicki , you did it !
good boy !
ha ha !
that's my grandson !
yuri , don't you want to see what your son is doing?
whoever said it's better to give than receive never got a christmas present iike the one i got in 1 991 from mikhaii gorbachev .
what the hell's the matter?
it's over !
it's over !
what's over?
the cold fucking war !
the soviet fucking union !
the evil fucking empire .
mikhail's saying " no mas .
he's throwing in the towel .
it's over !
your son is walking .
that's incredible , honey .
at least there'll be religious freedom .
let's hope so .
i think i'll go back for a visit .
do you stay in touch with uncle dmitri?
i'm not a fool , yuri .
i don't think you're going just to sell pepsi cola .
ls this how you want to be remembered?
i don't want to be remembered at all .
lf i'm being remembered it means i'm dead .
merry fucking christmas !
who is this , vitaly?
i'm angel .
her name really is angel .
she's a fairy .
let's put her on top of the christmas tree .
i love you !
come on .
i love you all .
take this .
i'm going back to ukraine .
i miss odessa .
i miss you .
i miss you .
be careful , yuri .
those things you sell kill .
lnside .
you're high .
well , that's true .
hello , christian .
during the cold war the red army stationed nearly one miilion troops in ukraine because of it's strategic military importance .
the day after the waii came down the paychecks stopped coming .
there's nothing better for an arms dealer than the combination of disgruntled soldiers and warehouses fuii of weapons .
i was hoping major generai dmitri volkoff would open a iot of armory doors in iots of military bases .
for a start , he was family .
he was a highly decorated hero of the red army and he was almost permanently shit faced .
i can't just sell you government property , yuri .
i have to report .
report to who?
moscow?
as of last week moscow's in a foreign country .
new flag , new boss .
there is no new boss yet .
they're all too busy squabbling over who's gonna get the presidential holiday home at the black sea .
it's beautiful .
the ones who know don't care anymore and the ones who care don't know .
show me your inventory .
those 45 years of mutuai hatred between the east and the west had generated the highest weapons buildup in history .
the soviets had guns coming out of the demon hole .
huge stockpiles , and now no enemy .
how many kalashnikovs do you have?
40, 000 .
ls that a four?
doesn't look like a four to me .
looks more like a one .
no , it's a four .
it's whatever we say it is because no one else will know the difference .
10, 000 kalashnikovs for a battalion .
your stocks are dangerously depleted , dmitri .
you should order more from the factory .
someone will work it out .
what happens then?
we'll cut them in .
the end of the cold war was the beginning of the hottest time in arms dealing .
the arms bazaar was open . guided missiles , unguided missiles , mortars , mines , armored personnei carriers .
whole tank divisions .
i even ianded a squadron of helicopter gunships
the most sophisticated fighting machines , built for a war with america that never happened .
thanks to me , they'd finaily get to fire a shot in anger .
i have a feeling it wasn't exactly what comrade lenin had in mind when he advocated the redistribution of wealth .
but i wasn't the only one offering a crash course in capitalism .
i had rivals .
lnform your commanding officer that simeon weisz is here to meet him .
you don't know who i am , do you?
you're late .
so it appears .
you look a little lost , simeon .
ls the world changing too fast?
i'm here , aren't l?
not all of you , i think .
you've gotten so rich selling for the cla you can't seem to get that ideology completely out of your head .
oh , the cold war had its uses .
kept attentions frozen .
now it's harder to determine which side one's on .
things have become more complicated .
no , it's gotten simpler .
there's no place in gunrunning for politics anymore , simeon .
i sell to leftists and rightists .
i'd sell to pacifists but they're not the most regular of customers .
of course you're not a true internationalist until you've supplied weapons to kill your own countrymen .
this current state of chaos won't last forever .
there'll have to be order .
lnstead of cutting each other's throats , it may be beneficial if we work together .
what do you think?
what do i think?
i think you're the amateur now .
i think you should go with your instincts .
with your first instinct .
i'm the same man who was not good enough for you before and i'm just not good enough for you now .
the problem with gunrunners going to war ... is that there's no shortage of ammunition .
this was the chaos that the old guard had always feared .
as far as they were concerned i was giving arms dealers a bad name .
but then they could hardly report me to the better business bureau .
and ukraine wasn't the only former state with an unpaid army and stockpiles of guns .
there was bulgaria , hungary ,
poland , belarus , aii there for the taking .
of aii the weapons in the vast soviet arsenai nothing was more profitable than avtomat kalashnikova , modei of 1 947 more commonly known as the ak 47 or kalashnikov .
it's the world's most popular assault rife .
a weapon aii fighters iove .
an elegantly simple 9 ib . amalgamation of forged steei and plywood .
it doesn't break , jam , or overheat .
it wiii shoot whether it's covered in mud or fiiled with sand .
it's so easy even a child can use it , and they do .
the soviets put the gun on a coin .
mozambique put it on their flag .
since the end of the cold war the kalashnikov has become the russian people's greatest export .
after that comes vodka , caviar and suicidai novelists .
one thing's for sure .
no one was iining up to buy their cars .
i thought you were supposed to be watching out for these people .
how can l?
you keep selling my helicopters .
you are too greedy , yuri .
i can't hold him forever .
i've got paperwork .
not for the gunships .
you know the penalty for sanction busting .
selling the military helicopter is a major violation .
military helicopter .
it's not a military helicopter .
it's a rescue helicopter .
get to work , son .
the law is on our side .
all right , let me see your papers .
no , no , put that away .
let's see your papers .
yuri orlov .
mr. orlov .
always in the wrong place at the right time .
we've met before .
off the coast of columbia .
what was the name of that freighter?
i can't remember .
was it kono or the kristol?
the crew called that vessel a lot of names , none of them repeatable in polite company .
answer the question .
the new mp 5 .
would you like a silencer for that?
i need to see your papers .
dmitri !
the end user certificate for this aircraft states " burkina faso .
nice .
very nice .
did you type this up yourself?
the helicopter is to be used on humanitarian missions .
oh , so you're a humanitarian?
oh , absolutely .
this is a military aircraft .
not anymore .
listen to the nephew .
what can they do with military hardware but convert it to civilian use?
the only way you could die from this baby now is if a food drop hits you .
and this stuff over here?
ls that going to burkina faso as well?
ah , but to a different client at a different address .
just a coincidence , is that it?
do you take me for a complete fucking fool?
not complete , sir .
and while i hesitate to tell you your job ,
i must point out that when shipped separately the weapons and the aircraft both comply with the current lnterpol trade standards and practices .
we both know that is an obscene bureaucratic loophole that's gonna be closed any goddamn day .
but it's not closed .
and while certain people might interpret this cargo as suspicious , thank god we live in a world where suspicion alone does not constitute crime .
and where men like you respect the rule of law .
i was as guilty as sin , but valentine couldn't prove it .
and he was the rarest breed of iaw enforcement officer .
the type who knew i was breaking the iaw but wouldn't break it himself to bust me .
valentine wasn't the only one trying to put me out of business .
my uncle had turned down a half dozen rivai arms dealers .
sometimes with offers better than mine .
but to dmitri , you couldn't put a price on ioyalty .
what was he doing here?
he is hoping to beat your offer .
i told him to go have intercourse with himself .
but yuri  you need to make more payoffs .
