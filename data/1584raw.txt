that's enough sight seeing .
buckle up , i'll need third gear .
no problem .
got any change?
no me neither .
was that daniel?
or the air force !
he's on form .
they won't catch him today .
don't talk too soon .
the police have a new weapon .
what?
they gonna bombard him with figs?
it's a secret weapon .
it's slow today .
shit !
298 km/ h !
listen up !
a white taxi clocked at 298 km/ h !
he's ours .
i thought they'd nodded off .
that's the police .
they're buddies .
we like a joke .

you bet .
that's an e mail .
enough fooling .
hold on !
why d'you stop?
i'm at top speed !
nitro?
no , a friend of mine mixes it up .
i'll give you the address of his bar .
kind of you .

ok , i get it !
thanks for your help .
hey , don't i know you?
if we'd met i'd remember you .
bye
emilien'll be mad .
taxi 3
what's wrong?
nothing ...
a nightmare .
go back to sleep .
what you doing?
nothing .
i can't sleep .
that gang again?
for 8 months , they're all i've thought about .
i know !
8 months , i need to talk to you .
they just slip between our fingers .
did you hear me?
sure .
i need to talk too .
they dress up as santa claus !
you don't believe in him?
they're going to surprise us .
and i'm going to surprise you .
i have to nail them before xmas .
we need to talk before xmas .
ok , that's a deal .
what you doing?
going to work .
it's 3 am !
it is?
good , less traffic .
no xmas shoppers .
no kidding .
better that way .
see you at the office .
i'd like an appointment !
lily !
you're awake?
it's 4 a. m and you're doing repairs .
not repairs .
it's winter .
i'm adjusting her for when it's cold .
better install a radiator in my bed , so i don't get cold either alone in my bed .
but me , it's all year round .
don't say that .
hands off !
or i'll need the scrub thingy .
what scrub thingy?
that cleans pot and pans and , sometimes , numbskulls like me .
i'll be right up .
i don't think so .
after you wash , you stink of turpentine .
and then it's time to get up for work .
you're on top form !
i got in 2 hours ago .
you were asleep so i came down here rather than watch tv .
daniel !
we have no tv !
it's the principle .
no tv !
no music !
no curtains !
no couch !
no vases !
but , hey , you don't send me flowers !
we have a fridge !
full of lamps but it's a fridge !
the shower stinks of gas the laundry of car wax and the closet's so full of tires
finally , we have every couple's ultimate luxury ...
a garage !
you got your period?
just the opposite !
i'm just sick of living in a garage .
a woman isn't a barbie with soft skin .
a woman moves , evolves and occasionally , likes a bit of comfort !
all because i'm working on the car !
women !
what's the deal with turps?
lily , what are you doing?
going home .
you prefer a boot camp?
with curtains , a garden and flowers !
it's stupid !
we can't ...
you liked living here .
now i don't but you won't listen .
you live for your car !
it's too small for both of us .
it's her or me !
take your pick !
hi , honeys , taking the kids out?
it's humor !
ajoke !
fun in the workplace , see?
merry christmas to you !
what you doing here?
you spend the night?
i was just taking 5 .
the file is printed to your face .
if it's like the rings on a tree
it looks as if you been asleep maybe ...
20 years !
ok , forget i spoke .
nobody has a sense of humor .
i thought the police had fun .
fun off , will you !
i got some great moroccan !
dirt cheap .
want a little?
from the high plateaus .
hold on , we're not into that .
you're missing out .
a little coke?
rachid !
have a nice day !
what the hell was that?
and who's this?
that's bob marley .
this isn't some kind of squat !
what about the gang?
the santa claus gang?
ring any bells?
37 jobs in 8 months and no leads !
i go over and over it .
nothing !
i feel empty , stupid , useless ...
sure you won't have
a rachid pick me up?
no !
just trying to help .
how about ... breakfast?
get your strength up .
ok , breakfast then .
jeez !
someone's hungry .
i don't eat .
my mind's on the gang !
nightmares !
tied up by dancing santa clauses .
it's horrible !
stop , please
your lace is undone .
it's xmas .
santa clauses everywhere .
in july , we'd easily spot them .
except , in july , we didn't spot them .
they must be planning a huge job !
one thing's bugging me .
why do they dress up as santa claus?
who'd suspect santa of anything?
he looks so sweet with his red costume often too big for him .
or too small .
it's an ideal disguise for concealing ...
a gun !
if sir's looking for the perfect blender fruit , veg , purees
if sir has children ...
everybody get down !
police !
you're under arrest !
what happened?
i got him !
after 8 months !
how d'you know he's with the gang?
does santa often carry a gun on him?
how did you know?
the jerk dropped it .
no kidding , he's a jerk !
the chief will love him .
hey , chief , we got one of the he's never in .
sit down and don't move , ok?
while we're waiting , i'm chief .
suit the desk , huh?
cut it out !
he's not here !
anyhow , promotion's coming my way now .
ok , daddy claus how d'you get a police gun?
who d'you steal it from?
alain , he needs an address .
marseille region?
if you need help , we have the yellow pages .
so what about the gun?
you realize we just look on the computer and we find the fool who got his gun stolen .
shit !
he stole gibert's gun !
no !
i swear !
you know this is our chief's gun?
maybe you'd like to explain?
alain !
maybe he'd answer without the tape?
you could be right .
emilien !
chief !
somebody needs me .
why the disguise , chief?
i'm doing my job !
i dressed up to infiltrate the gang and you screwed it up !
i'm sorry , but why not let us in on it?
it wasn't an invasion .
it was infiltration .
alone !
don't worry , i'll see you get the chance to dress up and direct traffic !
get these cuffs off me .
sure , chief .
shit , they're alain's cuffs .
hurry up , emilien .
5 minutes !
you're captain gibert?
not yet .
i mean , i'm not captain yet .
i'm not gibert either .
i mean i'd hate to be gibert be right back , chief !
you are captain gibert?
that's me .
what can i do for you?
my name is qiu .
that's cute , qiu very cute .
you are ...
i could get to like you ...
like ...
you're chinese?
yes .
from my mother .
swiss from my dad .
great , i love the swiss .
i work for the magazine
world international , writing a piece on french police .
i asked to follow a major detective and you are the biggest
true enough i mean , 6'3 " is fairly big
for a cop , it's rare .
that's impressive !
sometimes , looking the mirror , i impress myself too
could i stick close for a few days?
as long as you like , i mean ...
as long as your piece takes .
y'know , i get close to my piece too .
thanks .
can we start?
with pleasure .
thank you , qiu .
it's ok .
why are you dressed as santa right here in your office?
this is my camouflage gear .
it's to infiltrate the santa claus gang .
we need to get inside their minds and bodies .
the cuffs?
they're not mine !
any other questions?
enter !
bad time?
no , it can't get any worse .
as you're not doing anything , i'd like to talk .
no time now , we'll talk at home .
at home , your mind's on work .
so i thought i'd better catch you at work .
not today , petra , ok?
for 8 months , you've said that .
i'm in the shit !
don't push me under , will you !
what's happened now?
i saw a santa claus .
with a gun !
i thought of the gang .
with or without a gun , it's all you think about .
this was santa with a gun !
so i neutralized him .
all by yourself?
not the gang , then?
not even !
gibert in disguise !
you can laugh .
i could have died .
you should console me .
console you?
i don't know , say something sweet , give me some good news .
i'm pregnant .
that's good news , isn't it?
sure ...
but ...
since when?
since 8 months ago .
how did that happen?
the holy spirit came down .
8 months ago?
i'd have noticed .
your breasts are all ...
so that's why they're ...
are you going to keep it?
it's a bit late now , huh?
sure .
why didn't you say?
i tried to tell you .
i put cauliflowers all over .
look i wondered about that .
and photos from the scan .
they're everywhere !
that's my baby?
mine .
if you want in , buck up .
is it normal?
knowing the dad , you might wonder .
but , oddly enough , it's normal .
so , if you're pregnant and it's normal and you're keeping it i'm going to be a daddy .
very good .
they could use you in the police .
you'd go far !
me , a daddy?
yes , and this kid will need a great daddy .
you can count on me , petra .
lily !
you're not laughing now .
what use is a car without the woman you love?
rapid test?
what's a rapid test?
2 lines?
what's that mean?
hi !
hi !
do you have the box that comes in?
let's see .
isn't it some kind of pregnancy test?
precisely !
can we hurry?
don't move .
it's next to the condoms .
i'm out of stock .
we had a rush on them .
women like to give a little baby for xmas .
that's what i'm thinking .
i understand .
i'll ask my daughter .
angele !
she helps out .
she knows it all by heart .
it's impressive .
angele , what's this?
sorry , i try to be careful but i was drunk .
i told you to help yourself to condoms .
there were none his size !
whose?
i dunno .
you don't know his name?
i was drunk .
i forgot their names .
merry christmas !
this is serious .
the santa claus gang defies us .
i tried a solo commando mission only to be thwarted by emilien .
never mind .
the future is ours .
we'll do with it what we will do .
tomorrow !
starting today !
you can quote me .
it's clumsy but effective .
your lace is undone .
wonderful .
indeed .
where was i?
this is serious .
i won't accept excessive haste or badly digested process .
don't quote me .
we must be perfect irreproachable ...
extra clean !
last summer i worked with the nypd .
i picked up some jargon .
isn't that wild?
so , hear this , men !
i want the santa claus gang behind bars before christmas .
so , no days off , medical certificates or letters from your parents .
on top of that , ms. qiu a journalist with world international , will accompany us .
let's give her a good image of our police force .
the key words on this mission
consult !
plan !
act !
i have named this operation snow white .
blanche neige in french .
guess who are the dwarves .
wonderful .
from now on , everybody's on deck 24/ 7 !
questions?
me !
what's the gift?
what gift?
sweet .
is it my birthday?
what month?
july .
it's for xmas then .
never mind .
i haven't got that one .
who's it from?
they know your hobbies .
there's a little button on the top .
put your guns down !
wonderful !
hi , lawmen !
this is santa !
if you believe in me get your gifts outside europa bank at noon
time anybody?
11 : 55 , chief .
red alert !
how can you work with these idiots?
don't quote me , ms. qiu .
it's very french .
we're always complaining .
spread out and wait .
i mean , let's go .
last time , they sped away .
now , we'll surprise them .
they told us to be here !
they sent the message thinking we'd think it was a hoax unaware that gibert doesn't fall on deaf traps .
he's here !
present and ready to rumble !
imagine the trap was to lure you here .
think , emilien .
it makes no sense .
a criminal who warns the police?
that's stupid !
that's what worries me .
they're not stupid !
there's a first time for everything .
unless unless what?
they're sure to escape .
let them try .
they won't go 10 meters .
trust me !
captin !
what's up?
they'll have to drive over us .
what the heck is that?
it's horrible !
you ok , chief?
i'm just dandy .
why are you still here?
how do we stop that?
i don't know ...
use your imagination !
requisition a car !
why didn't he stop?
black and a cop?
no chance !
even so , he could've slowed down .
i'm fine .
i'm used to it .
let's requisition our cars !
right .
to the cars !
the anti theft system is totally unique based on the atlas system used by the police .
press here and it alerts the nearest police unit .
very efficient .
holy fuck !
my car !
i'll get out .
less weight .
your 50 pounds won't make much difference .
as for you the old port of marseille and its famous canebiere from " canabe " , the hemp they used for the ropes .
it was king louis xlv in 1661 who ...
watch out !
you have to keep up !
i am !
the canebiere founded in 1661 ...
not keep up with me , knucklehead !
with the off roader !
d'you see , qiu?
we can't get the staff .
they recruit any old how .
this lad would make a good lifeguard .
but here he is leading a chase without a license .
he doesn't have a license?
i only started yesterday .
no way !
calm !
he just has to follow the car ahead .
any lifeguard can handle that .
what now?
just follow , kid .
that thing guzzles so much gas , he'll run out before us .
in 5 ', he's ours !
we won't last 5 '.
we will ...
shouldn't we stop to say sorry?
all in good time .
first , the chase !
seek and destroy !
funny one .
should i stop?
what for?
the pool !
good thinking .
gee , that was close .
hey !
take it easy !
nowhere near 5 '!
see that?
perfect seal .
no leaks .
is it always like this?
most times we get cars that leak !
i can't swim .
we have a lifeguard .
daniel !
good to see you .
you look terrible .
you see too much of lily .
justjoking ...
have fun while you're young .
seen my driver?
he's late .
one block up .
he won't be long .
perfect !
is lily in?
of course .
sorry .
didn't see you there .
don't worry , i'm used to it .
look who it is !
can we talk a minute?
i'm going out .
to the doctor's .
give me a ride , dad?
of course .
where's my car?
he did seem in difficulty .
can i give you both a ride?
affirmative !
teach him to be late !
c'mon , all aboard !
boulevard cassini , driver !
yes , ma'am .
you're late , son .
daniel offered us a ride .
see you at barracks .
taking it easy?
you think?
the roads are wild and full of potholes , terrible and a little calm does you good .
indeed but i don't want to be late .
what's wrong?
it hurts !
where does it hurt?
my belly .
that's awful !
what do we do , general?
how do i know?
are you really in pain?
i'm better now .
it's gone .
sure?
yes , it's gone ...
it's gone ...
you never used to be so emotional .
it's xmas , the gifts , all that ...
it gets to me .
yes , so i see .
what's that behind your ear?
nothing !
a kind of thermometer .
it takes your blood pressure .
1 line , you're ok .
2 lines , you're not ok .
that's why i'm taking it easy .
thanks for the ride most agreeable .
see you tonight , honey .
i'll ask the doctor but i'd say you've no hope .
i hate to intrude but i'm going to be late .
lift off !
enter .
are you ok?
couldn't be better .
we're betrayed by our own equipment .
how can we work?
don't forget that .
we need funds .
i want solid chairs , higher doors because
and life buoys in every car .
remember?
glug glug ...
you see !
not to mention comfortable shoes .
these ones are killing me !
but they're brand new .
what prankster did that?
it's not funny .
the other one's the same .
it's not funny at all .
sometimes , it's just too much .
relax , captain .
you're too tense .
it's that gang .
the santa claus gang !
forget about them and let me take care of you .
you know how that works?
a little .
we got them last week .
i hid my typewriter so they couldn't take it away .
let yourself go , captain .
in 5 minutes you'll be thinking clearly .
you think so?
i'm sure of it .
i can't see .
is that normal?
perfectly normal .
relax .
that feels good .
it's all draining away .
that's exactly it .
you'll see .
y'know , i'm scared i'll nod off .
i'll wake you .
excellent !
you know where you are?
no , where?
police hq !
no way !
looks like a garage .
comedian , huh?
morning , general .
at ease .
thanks , daniel .
see you tonight .
my savior !
can you drop me off?
i'll give you a ride .
am i glad to see you !
'scuse me ...
can i go?
i suppose so .
can you keep an eye on the space?
i'll be back .
easy , i'm not late .
yes , boss .
you'll never guess .
neither will you .
take a guess .
it's unbelievable .
you got promotion?
no , it's personal .
marriage?
i'm going to be a daddy !
i don't believe it .
you'd better .
it's wonderful !
lily's pregnant too .
no way !
that's wonderful .
we'll be daddies together .
would you believe that !
friends for so long and now having a kid together .
i mean , each having a kid at the same time .
separately yeah , separately , sure .
how many months?
8 !
you didn't say !
i didn't know .
you're first to know .
ahead of my mom .
and you?
how many months?
2 lines .
2 lines?
it's a thing you pee on to see how pregnant you are .
she's 2 lines pregnant .
wow , that's cool .
yeah , it's cool .
captain ...
visitors .
what's this?
good to see you all .
we were just ...
my colleague here from china has great relaxation technique .
5 hours 'sleep in 5 minutes .
no kidding , it energizes .
the lesson is over .
see you later , captain .
thank you , qiu .
what can i do for you?
there were all these cauliflowers .
i didn't even notice .
how dumb can you be?
that dumb .
but why cauliflowers?
how do i know?
it should have given me a hint .
nada !
i am such a klutz .
that's going too far .
if you were , she'd bail .
you think?
petra's anything but a masochist .
that's good to hear .
yeah but we're still in shit .
whaddya mean?
you're always chasing thieves and i'm a car freak .
we drive them crazy .
and a kid takes up a lot of space .
we have to change our ways .
right !
see him walk take him to school
that's notjust yet .
it's fingers in sockets first .
outlet plugs !
sure jeez , you don't think how much work it is .
shit !
good stuff .
rachid give it to you?
you know rachid?
a little .
hey , the sun's coming up .
say , daniel ...
santa on a scooter is that normal?
usually he's on a sleigh .
discreet but edgy that's not normal .
you just said we had to work less to look after our women and future progeny no chase , ok?
follow him .
at your service !
got anything on scooter 75 bn 13?
i'll hold .
stolen 2 weeks ago .
perseverance always pays .
petra'll be pleased .
we locate their hideout and i pass it on .
where would i be without you?
even deeper in it .
we'll lose him .
our only lead and i lose him !
every problem has a solution .
what the hell?
what are you doing?
got a better way to tail a scooter?
no .
maybe it's a bit conspicuous .
act cool , we'll be fine .
cool , ok
you saw where he went .
now call your chief .
i messed up once .
not again .
i have to check my sources .
santa on a stolen scooter in a warehouse?
what more d'you want?
i can't screw up .
it'll take 5 minutes .
proof?
or d'you wanna see their guns work?
no , that's fine .
best find out how many there are .
come with me .
don't you know when to stop?
you said you'd call in .
he'll want to know how many .
and is this their hq or a drop?
it'll take 5 minutes .
i don't see this working .
i saw it in a movie .
it's mind over matter .
i know .
that's why i'm worried .
if i'm hurt , call gibert .
your lace ...
hello !
i saw the doc .
wanna hear?
if he's good , sure .
he's excellent .
recommended by marie sophie who had 4 kids in 4 years .
that'll be hard to beat .
living apart , yeah .
lily , i'm trying but you have to be there to see it .
can you speak up?
the santas have got emilien .
looks like they're about to
lily , lily
aw , shit !
what are you doing here?
guess .
i've been trained to resist torture .
i'll never talk .
we don't need you to .
we know everything .
anyhow , torture's outdated .
we've more effective ways of getting a man to talk .
really?
the gentle touch , for example .
that's the most fearsome of weapons .
what's a hunk like you doing in the police?
my job .
hey , that's off limits .
you do seem open to a little persuasion .
that's my cell phone .
let's take a look .
a superb model .
it's off .
can i turn it on?
you have no right !
i'm out of units !
it's human rights abuse !
this is inhumane .
the end justifies the means !
i mean to justify your end .
can't take your call , i'm busy .
give your id , we'll be in touch .
you must be on a mission .
i'm very proud of you and your devotion to your work .
you put everything into it .
think of yourself a little .
relax and enjoy life's pleasures .
and maybe make some time for me too .
call me when it's over .
big kisses !
you again?
have you seen emilien?
he's been kidnapped !
what on earth for?
by a group of armed santa clauses .
it's the santa claus gang !
you don't say .
he went in alone?
not quite .
i have an infallible plan to get them .
he will be avenged .
to the cars !
can you stick close by?
i've a sinking feeling about this .
find the santas and we find emilien .
but in what state?
that's cheery .
captin !
what good timing !
we're going to catch the santas in the act !
in the sack with them !
can i come?
it's way too dangerous .
it won't be a christmas carol .
captain ...
please !
ok , it's not far .
follow us , huh?
into position .
so , this is xmas .
i'll turn on their lights no messing .
how did you find them?
my private grapevine .
my brother is in sanitation .
he flunked his police exams .
he cribbed off me but inverted the questions so he got zero .
that happened to all my pals too .
nobody asked you .
anyway , he called me about work in the sewers .
discreetly , i probe and find ...
a tunnel !
between bank and store .
so they can spend the cash right away .
they rob the bank on sunday and walk out via the store .
i get it .
as santas , nobody notices .
the santa disguise was to help them rob the richest bank in marseille .
of course !
you're a genius !
no , talent and brain power are nothing without training .
can i make a call?
go ahead .
that's funny .
emilien has the same .
hello !
it melts in the ear .
activate plan b.
i got it !
ok .
what a beautiful tongue ...
chinese !
chief !
movement inside .
ready !
see the 4 wheel monster and destroy !
i hear you .
xmas is over !
gibert means business .
what the heck?
where's the big monster?
well then?
catch them !
alive even !
requisitioned !
alain , follow me !
we have a wonderful view over the port .
it's quiet in winter?
very .
stop !
chief , wait for me !
in the name of the law !
like i said , minister we need more funding .
yes , 1 bike for 2 officers is not good .
not good at all .
tell the chopper we're on schedule .
i'll miss you , sweet little emilien .
but you won't suffer .
great .
you'll have the privilege of knowing when you'll die thanks to modern technology .
that's my swiss side .
when the mechanism triggers the ball will swing down on its cable with you in the front row .
how long before it triggers?
you have exactly 5 minutes .
shit !
make the most of it to purify your soul .
you must cleanse your mind and review your life before meeting the eternal .
5 'to cleanse my mind?
you have to prioritize .
i took your cell phone as a souvenir .
i'm very sentimental .
that's my chinese side .
cleanse my mind?
sure .
what we need is a miracle .
even a tiny one .
not the ball !
not the taxi !
you've no idea what happened .
it's terrible .
we must find her .
she has my cell .
not to mention all the loot !
but the cell was a gift from petra .
if china girl answers it , i'm for it .
did i just save your life?
sure .
i'd have done the same for you .
so i'd die run over by a cop car .
hey , my driving's getting better .
not your manners .
say thank you .
if we let the gang get away , my life's worthless .
gibert will throttle me .
we'll find your gang !
now , say thank you .
how'll we find them?
we've no leads , no clues !
is that good enough?
what?
sorry , pal .
i'm sorry .
my nerves are giving out .
i can't take it .
china girl ...
she tortured me for hours .
i can't forget .
she tortured you?
it was horrible .
how?
things i'd never tried .
you can't guess ...
i can't talk about it .
it still hurts ...
i understand .
don't worry .
we'll find her !
come on !
did she mention anything?
just a chopper that's waiting somewhere .
and she had fur boots on .
fur boots?
notice anything?
no !
it's cold .
yeah !
melted snow?
if it's still here , it came from high up and nearby .
with those boots they're headed back there .
probably .
but why the mountains?
on the other side?
switzerland !
of course !
she's half swiss it's home field .
they drive up and ski across blending in with the tourists ...
all the way to their chopper .
that's wonderful !
let's find the resort closest to the border big enough for a chopper .
tignes val d'isere !
see anything?
not really .
nothing to report .
so where to for the vacation?
we'll head for the slopes .
now , let's hope we were right and we spot their car .
you look right , i'll look left .
you don't know left from right?
right for you?
sorry , my fault .
i took it as facing you .
you're next to me .
but i thought you meant facing you .
what?
the car !
told you .
try a shortcut .
first right .
you know tignes?
they're all alike .
trust my instinct .
i prefer to trust mine .
i'll take a right .
watch out !
that was close !
where are we?
look for a sign .
what's with all these cars?
they must be from the ski school .
what's that sign say?
1 '10 " off the lead .
is that good?
we'll improve next lap .
shit !
that's screwed it .
look at the tracks .
a snowmobile !
we'll never catch them .
the chase is over .
it's never over .
this isn't about speed it's about snow .
nothing's impossible .
you like my winter collection?
yeah , not bad .
you tried it out?
not yet .
i'd say it works .
i'd say so .
but where'd they go?
let's follow the tracks .
yeah , i see .
well spotted .
can the taxi do a chopper too?
maybe that's asking too much .
i'd better warn the general then .
very good idea .
lend me your cell phone?
she has mine .
transfer the cash .
we must be gone before sunset .
get to work !
you think they're inside?
hard to say .
hello !
operation snow white is underway .
we'll be there in 10 '.
i have your chief here .
he insisted on coming along .
you sure this is a good idea?
i served with an alpine regiment .
13th battalion , special section .
i know the mountains .
but this is high up .
you ever seen snow?
i'm from grenoble .
i didn't say a word .
let's go !
everybody out !
i'll go take a look .
i wouldn't .
i'll be 5 '.
he just won't be told .
ok , let's stay together .
see?
no need to muck up my seats !
it's only water .
it's snow !
snow leaves marks !
i'll clean your damn car !
what with?
i said i'll clean it .
you mr. clean?
give me a break !
c'mon , clear out !
you ski?
no , i drive !
follow me !
this is a forest !
scare you?
the car scares me .
what are you doing?
putting the tires back on .
we've spotted the chopper .
get ready !
are you sure ...?
i checked all my gear .
i'll be fine .
let's go , guys !
what happened?
wait for me !
the strap must be too short .
obviously it is .
you're cutting it?
too right .
there we are !
wait !
the next racer to set off is austria's hans gherart one of the big favorites .
are we lost?
if we follow the flags , we'll be ok .
first at kitzbuhel , now here at val d'isere he's crushed the competition .
he's smashed the intermediate times .
he seems certain to be world champion .
victory is his for the taking ...
then again a taxi wins by a short head .
it's too quiet .
souvenir?
not where you're going?
just cleanse your mind .
take her away !
you're not too bitter about being tortured for hours .
forgive and forget .
sure .
and gibert?
he was supposed to be here .
an incoming gibert !
chief !
watch where you land !
no worries , emilien .
it's only snow .
that has to be cold !
hey !
my waters have broken !
you're giving birth?
now?
not yet but hurry up !
i'll be right there !
chief , petra's in labor !
ajob for me , i guess .
sweetheart !

everything'll be fine !
don't faint !
it's not a good time .
i'll be fine .

watch the screen for contractions .

you want to cut the cord?
that had better wait , do you mind?
what you doing?
practicing .
why?
you pregnant?
no , the woman i love is .
i want to be ready when it's my turn .
someone's stupid enough to have your baby?
i'm very lucky .
and i made promises .
such as?
to spend more time with her to be a great dad
the fridge?
empty !
and to be a great husband if she'll marry me .
she believed you?
no way .
it was perhaps the first big mistake of her life because i was truly sincere .
sincerity's not the problem .
finding the time is .
the time to work at it .
will you marry me?
now that you got me pregnant?
lily !
i'm from an old fashioned family y'know .
do me the honor of being my wife .
depends .
