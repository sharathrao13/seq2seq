what happened untll now
my son !
go now !
who are you , boy?
what happened?
i can't remember .
fire will rain down from the sky very soon .
with the fire a man will come .
the warrior's strength will match your own .
he will even best you in battle .
do you believe in destiny?
we were meant to meet .
you're the queen of iceland?
yes .
does that make a difference?
no .
not to how i feel about you .
i will love you forever .
don't stare at the princess .
i'm not staring !
she is , though !
lord hagen .
fafnir the dragon is awake .
you must convince king gunther to gather his best warriors and kill fafnir .
i too ask to join your quest against the dragon .
that task is only for those warriors most honoured and favoured by the king .
to the forest of fafnir !
the dragon's hide was hard as iron .
our weapons were useless against it .
he will be revenged , my lady !
i swear it !
this gold is not for humankind .
it belongs to us .
that is the ring of the nibelung , the oldest thing in the hoard .
the one who possesses it , is the treasur's owner .
it comes with a curse !
fafnir is the evidence .
heed our warning , or you too will pay .
what sorcery's this?
the magical tarnhelm .
with it you can wear any shape you desire .
his name is alberich , and he was one of us .
but greed awoke in alberich .
he wanted the treasure all for himself .
like you .
it's all mine now .
eric the blacksmith killed the dragon !
fafnir is dead !
i command that eric , the blacksmith , be proclaimed a hero of the kingdom !
even the honour of guarding the treasure would bring fame to burgund , my lord , once it is known that you have been entrusted with the safety of the hoard .
defeat dragons with iron , but win maidens with gold !
my heart is pledged already .
would i know her?
no .
she lives far away .
and i will marry no one else , hallbera .
not a prince , not a king , not the roman emperor himself .
i will bring my love with me to xanten as my wife .
but you're going to come with me !
i have no more travelling left in me .
i've hardly even breath anymore .
they call me erik , the blacksmith , erik , the dragonslayer , and erik , the hero of burgund .
i am siegfried !
son of siegmund , king of xanten .
you're beaten , and your kingdoms will be devided between the kings of burgund and xanten .
i want him tied to the house of burgund forever .
my sister will marry siegfried of xanten .
and i'm sure you will not find this too difficult to arrange .
what do you have in mind?
one of your cantrips , spells , potions .
if he could forget his other love , and ... find the princess attractive instead , then the gold stays where it is .
so near to my heart and my mind and yet so far from my arms and my body .
how much longer?
how much farther?
all he must do , is to drink this , mixed with wine .
and as long as it is you who gives him the cup , any love for any other woman would be forgotten , and only you will burn in his heart from that moment on .
1'500 years ago , most of europe ... had abandoned its own believes and turned to the christian faith .
only in the north did the people hold on to the gods of their ancestors .
the most powerful of these gods was odin .
he reigned among the stars in valhalla , and his ravens ... gave him wisdom and memory .
but whilst the fire of the ancient powers faded ... a wondrous tale arose , that captured the hearts of the people .
the dragon gold .
king siegfried of xanten !
i thank you for your hospitality .
you were always welcome !
i know that the treasure ... has brought you and your kingdom great misfortune and blood shed , and for that i truly apologize .
many wars are fought for gold ... and treasures .
no army has ever waged war with a hero such as you among them .
you didn't destroy lives !
you saved them .
you've done the kingdom of burgund a great service .
thank you , my king .
king siegfried , would you join us in a toast before you leave?
this is a special wine of burgund , mixed with spices .
to siegfried of xanten !
to the hero who arrived a blacksmith and leaves a king !
to king siegfried of xanten .
to king siegfried of xanten .
good wine ...
though the spices gave it a strange flavour .
where are gunther and hagen?
they left .
will you make it again for me some time , only with less cinnamon?
of course , i will .
but first i must confess something .
what?
at the dragon feast ... you told a masked girl that your heart was already pledged to somebody else .
so it was you .
forgive me ,
i couldn't say anything because ...
please , it doesn't matter , because i love you and i don't know ... why it never occurred to me .
nothing matters now ,
except that you love me ,
and i love you .
where might my raven be?
i'm proud that burgund has won you as brother in law .
nobody could bring more honour to our kingdom than you , siegfried .
i want to make your sister my queen before i return to my kingdom .
unfortunately in our kingdom , the law decrees that the king must marry before any of his siblings .
how long do we have to wait then?
it's not that simple .
the queen i desire is a beautiful and powerful woman who challenges ... her suitors to single combat .
till now , nobody has proved ... strong enough to defeat her .
and who is this powerful woman?
her name is brunhild .
queen of iceland .
i've met her once .
you know her?
yes .
her ship sailed by our smithy one day .
how could i forget?
she's of extraordinary beauty .
but you said you've met her?
i did .
that night a star fell from the sky ... into the forest near our smithy .
we met by the crater it made , and we fought .
but why?
i mistook her for a saxon , and i wrestled her down .
you mistook the queen of iceland for a saxon?
how did she react?
she was a little surprised , that's all .
siegfried , she is the woman i wish to marry .
would you help me win her for burgund's queen?
how?
by fighting her in my stead .
wouldn't she notice?
not if you wear that magic helmet of yours .
these powers shouldn't be abused .
only you could defeat her .
king gunther has given you his only sister in marriage .
will you not help him win a queen for himself?
think , siegfried ...
if i marry brunhild , you and kriemhild can be married the very same day .
i knew what the wagons were carrying , when they came , but i had no idea it could look so beautiful .
it's yours .
mine?
the treasure is my wedding gift to you .
but this ring ... is the symbol of our love .
wear it till i come back from iceland .
every day without you will be an eternity .
come back soon .
and bring my brother back safely .
my king , we found a stowaway , hidden amidst the stores .
throw him over the side !
i think you should see him first .
giselher !
are you insane?
i only wanted to see the norse women , the great valkyries who fight like men !
why , giselher?
do you want a warrior woman of your own?
why didn't you ask me?
i've always asked you , and you've always turned me down .
your have to look after burgund .
and kriemhild will be worried about you !
kriemhild knows .
i've half a mind to send you back !
oh , come on , gunther .
what boy doesn't crave an adventure like this?
sit down .
and those are the seven silver apples of the goddess of youth .
you know a lot !
not as much as my father eyvind did .
see over there , that's orwandil , the giant , and next to it is fearr , the bull that he hunts , and see there , that's the spirits 'road , the bright road to valhalla .
the gods sit up there with the holy dead , and decide what we should do to help them save the world ...
how do we find out what they want?
they send us signs .
in water , fire , or in the sky .
what happens if we read those signs wrong?
i don't know .
he's coming , your future husband is coming !
siegfried .
rise the sails .
yes , sir .
rise the sails !
welcome to my country , tamer of the fire and the elements .
at last , you've found your way to me .
the dragonslayer's fame reaches even here .
it is not i who come to challenge you , great queen .
it is king gunther of burgund who seeks your hand .
i only serve him !
my queen ...
i come here to seek your hand in marriage .
we will fight a duel of double bladed axes .
if you win ,
i will wed you .
if i win , it will cost you your life .
if i fail to make you my wife , i will die gladly .
the contest commences in one hour .
giselher .
let's wait outside .
shadows and vapours , all the same ...
just stay hidden until it's done .
what about siegfried?
he'll follow us later .
the dragonslayer doesn't join you?
he is already preparing the ship ... for our return .
the axes !
you can still sail back to burgund alive !
come on !
here !
come on !
bow to my future husband .
the king of burgund , now the king of iceland .
leave until i call you , and close the door .
they make no sense , lady .
look there .
that means a cloak or a mask .
something or someone ... has been hidden .
the way truth is hidden by lies , or eyes are covered by a blindfold .
is that why siegfried didn't recognize me?
there is nothing here .
the gods are silent .
ever since you came to burgund in the guise of a humble blacksmith , many good things have happened in our kingdom .
now around this table are the two men i love most in the world .
giselher is my brother by birth , and it would please me if you ... would become our brother by blood .
the dragon's blood made my skin impenetrable .
but i guess tonight is a night for trust .
this is the only place where i can be wounded .
and now both of you share the greatest secret i have .
this cup will hold no lesser drink than the blood of brotherhood .
it will be raised in no lesser toast .
and may those who betray that trust , die dishonoured and accursed .
people of burgund !
your queen !
i present my sister kriemhild .
i'll be a sister to you as well !
we will celebrate two weddings on one day .
where's my tarnhelm?
i'm not done with it yet .
you can have it in due course .
that wasn't the deal , hagen !
i'm not sure if it worked .
it worked !
it worked !
and now you're trying to cheat me .
perhaps i should find a way ... to have a little talk with the king .
no , no .
no need for that .
i'll do it .
queen brunhild .
can i help you?
i waited for you , as i said i would .
siegfried .
what happened?
did you find you couldn't love a queen as well as you did a passing stranger?
or was it the gold?
that has turned many hearts cold before .
i don't know .
who shall i ask ... why you loved me then , and don't love me now?
i didn't ...
don't lie to me .
you cannot claim you didn't want me then !
it was your first time , blacksmith .
and mine as well .
and i knew then that the gods had sent you to me ... and me to you .
and you knew it too !
does that mean nothing?
that's not how i remember it .
and you never loved me?
even though you said you did .
i was a boy then ...
if this is what manhood brings ,
i only wish i'd learned this lesson sooner , but it's too late now .
perhaps i should pray ... that i too will remember our love so little , because i will never know joy again ... till i forget or you remember .
king gunther , do you take brunhild as your wife and queen?
i do !
and do you , brunhild , accept my king as your rightful husband and lord?
i do .
do you , kriemhild , take siegfried as your lawful wedded husband?
i do .
king siegfried , do you take kriemhild as your lawful wedded wife?
i do .
i now pronounce you man and wife .
this warlike display shows our burgund swords ... and warriors at their finest .
they could only be bettered ... by the great queen brunhild and the extraordinary king gunther .
those few of us who were privileged to travel with king gunther to iceland , witnessed a display of incomparable skills .
he was the only man who could match his beautiful queen in her challenge .
siegfried could .
but siegfried didn't .
would he like to try?
it would be an honour ,
queen brunhild .
what weapons shall we choose then?
weapons that were forged from the same ore and have never been crossed .
my spear ... and your sword !
thank you for this chance to recognize my limits .
what happened?
i was tired .
i decided to lie down .
that's not what i meant .
why did you leave without me?
siegfried .
our fight in public .
but you won !
he let me win .
that was not an honest victory .
he was lucky , that's all .
maybe he gave up , so he wouldn't go to his marriage bed covered with bruises !
you're the only woman i've ever really wanted !
and do you have me?
or do you?
you want me , my strong husband?
i'm waiting .
no more of this !
i've drunk too much tonight to deal with such foolishness .
the man who defeated me hadn't drunk too much .
what?
or then again maybe you had been drinking .
some magical potions to give you strength , perhaps?
my strength is a gift from the gods , and it lies in this belt .
once you've removed it , you'll find a yielding maiden in your arms !
can the man who survived my challenge not survive his own wedding night?
brunhild !
well !
stop ...
untie me !
stop this !
untie me !
untie me right now !
be quiet now !
wife , are you mad?
let me loose !
gunther is a lucky man .
not as lucky as i am .
don't you think brunhild's beautiful?
what a question here and now !
siegfried , answer me !
alright , yes .
but it's a hard beauty .
you've noticed it then ... what?
that coldness .
well , she's certainly angry about being defeated by gunther .
i don't think she likes me much .
maybe because you won your husband without having to fight him .
you hear that?
that's thor , swinging his hammer .
probably to tell us about the new little war god who will be conceived tonight !
giselher .
you don't really believe in all this pagan nonsense , do you?
i do !
and so does siegfried .
and he's the greatest hero burgund has ever known !
in living life by the sword .
and i'm going to do the same .
and when i die , i will be rewarded by sitting at the warriors 'table , next to father odin himself !
you should hear yourself !
don't the old ways fascinate you?
no , they don't !
they scare me .
the powers in it are uncontrollable , dangerous .
anyway , it's not the way we were brought up .
lena .
i didn't mean to hurt you .
brunhild , please don't let the servants see me like this .
i promise ,
i'll never try to subdue you again .
then let this be a lesson to you .
i might be captive in this gilded cage , but i'll never be your wife !
gunther .
siegfried .
what's the matter?
blood brother , can i speak openly , and know you won't tell anyone else?
of course !
the queen ...
we haven't ...
i mean ...
what?
she won't let me into her bed .
i'm sorry .
and burgund needs an heir .
i must have a son !
if there was anything i could do , i would .
but this is not a battle ...
i can win for you .
your strength is greater than hers !
and her strength doesn't even come from her own body .
it comes from her pagan belt .
now , if you could get it away from her ...
no !
no , gunther !
i'm only asking you to take her belt , not ... substitute for me some other way !
you'd refuse to help the man who gave you his own sister?
your magic tarnhelm worked for us ... in iceland , blood brother .
but if you don't use it here tonight ... then all of that's been wasted , and my marriage is a joke ...
shadows and vapours , all the same .
good night , my king .
lena !
you two go ahead !
i have to tell you something .
i love you , too .
he just passed this way .
something very strange ...
is happening here .
i just want us to be happy together , to be man and wife .
look at you , my king .
you are a match for me , are you not?
after all you defeated me in iceland .
well , well .
my king regains his steel !
strange how it comes and goes without warning .
listen !
i don't want to fight .
i love you !
prove it .
that's what i needed to know .
siegfried?
now you can be my husband .
where are you going?
to get rid of this pagan witchery .
and when i return ,
i expect you to be my wife .
do you swear to keep this secret?
in iceland i saw two gunthers too !
when my brother returned of this victory of a queen brunhild , it wasn't gunther who arrived in the room .
it was siegfried .
gunther had been hiding in there all the time .
i know it wasn't my brother who defeated brunhild .
it was siegfried !
where have you been?
kriemhild !
why aren't you in bed?
i woke up , and you weren't there .
i couldn't get back to sleep without you , so i waited .
what's that in your hand?
nothing important .
let me see .
a woman's belt?
why try to hide it?
it's not what you think !
we've only been married one day .
your brother needed me !
what for?
that i cannot tell you .
why not?
i promised not to .
i swear before all the gods , that i remain your true and faithful husband .
so why won't you answer my questions?
what kind of help did my brother ... need from you that took you from your bed at this hour?
what kind of help leaves a woman's belt in your hand?
if i told you , i would be breaking a vow of utmost secrecy .
break it .
open the doors for us , please .
i cannot do that , my lady .
cannot?
why not?
orders from the queen .
what?
no one may enter the church until the queen has done so .
are you joking?
open the doors !
we cannot , lady kriemhild .
brunhild , how dare you order the doors of this place closed to me?
i am the king's own sister !
and i am his wife , the queen !
it is only right that i should enter before any other lesser royals .
step aside now and let your queen pass !
you're no queen of mine , brunhild !
and how dare you refer to my husband as lesser than anyone?
he even introduced himself in iceland as gunther's servant !
he certainly served your husband well when he defeated you last night !
what did you say?
you heard me .
it was also my husband who conquered you in iceland .
you insult the queen of burgund in public with these lies?
so first i'm a servant's wife and now i'm a liar?
do you recognize this?
who gave you that?
my husband !
do you believe me now?
he took it from you last night , in your own bedroom .
it surprises me that you couldn't tell .
now get out of my way .
i do not get how you could reveal my and your brothers most intimate secret , in front of the whole of burgund .
kriemhild , i only broke my vow because i counted on your discretion .
i know .
i am sorry .
please forgive me .
i love you more than life , and now i'm terrified ... that something awful will happen and somehow we'll be parted .
no more tears .
in two days we'll be far away from this place , from your brother ... and the complications of his marriage .
he was wrong ... to make you a part of it .
he took advantage of your loyalty .
but it's over now .
i'll attend the hunt with him , and we'll part as friends .
today i give orders for the gold to be loaded onto our ship .
as soon as ... the hunt is done , we can be on our way .
can't it be done any sooner?
can't we leave immediately?
i wish , but we cannot give your brother the impression that we leave , bearing him ill will .
i told you he was not to be trusted .
what justice can i ... possibly administer to put this right?
the simple justice ...
laid down in our books of law may not be sufficient in this case .
he used magic to help you , it's true .
but what other use has he made of it?
you've heard the people praise him more than you .
your brother in law has a legitimate claim to the throne of burgund .
what's he planning next , my king?
your downfall?
you told me the presence of that hoard in my chamber would only bring me good !
even if the queen gets a child by you , every tongue in burgund will wag ... with the gossip that it's really siegfried's bastard !
the kingdom is already ripe with this scandal .
it won't go away .
it will taint to you and your house ... till the end of your days unless something is done .
i'll end the alliance and send him away .
let him live out his days in xanten .
it's not enough .
you may not care if men scorn you as a weakling and a cuckold .
but what about me?
i was betrayed by the dragonslayer and by you .
i am the queen of iceland and burgund .
i will not be dishonoured .
i will be avenged .
there is only one punishment fit for such a crime .
what would you have me do?
it's very simple .
siegfried must die .
you can't mean it !
he's my friend .
my blood brother !
after what we've shared ... a betrayal like that .
i can't just have him killed !
either you will kill him ... or i will kill myself .
my king , perhaps his punishment could come about " accidentally " ... at the hunt tomorrow .
you know siegfried is invincible .
and you know as well as i that he is not .
king siegfried , shall we ride together?
may i join you as well?
i'd be honoured !
queen brunhild?
queen brunhild , please let me talk to you .
our trouble has to be settled .
please , queen brunhild .
i have something that's rightfully yours which i must return .
indeed you have something that is rightfully mine .
but it's far too late to return it .
you christians make much of forgiveness .
don't look for such in me .
i don't , queen brunhild .
all i can do is say how bitter my sorrow is for the way i treated you in front ... of the cathedral .
i was jealous .
when i thought of what seemed to be happening ,
i couldn't bear it .
once i loved a man whom i thought the gods themselves had sent me .
i loved the whole world because he was in it .
long we were parted , but i could bear it ... because i knew he would return one day .
but when he came again , it was as if his heart had been wiped clean .
i loved him as i had , but he did not love me .
we were strangers , as before we had been lovers .
siegfried?
siegfried .
i have done you a terrible wrong .
let's speak no more about the church .
i am not speaking of the cathedral .
i speak of something far worse .
what are you talking about?
you have done me no other greater harm .
once i loved a man who did not love me , and i could not bear it , for the world was an empty place without him .
so when hagen came to me with an unholy thing , that would banish the memory of old loves and plant a new one there .
i blinded myself to what was right , and gave it to that man to drink .
it was hagen's magic .
siegfried never knew .
even if he did , there would be nothing ... he could do against it .
that is my great sin against you , and him , and i will do penance for it for the rest of my life .
so i'm not the only one who got lucky .
well done , brother .
have a drink with us .
i'll wash the blood up , first .
brunhild ...
is siegfried not back?
we should leave before dark .
i'll go and get him .
siegfried?
siegfried !
no !
help .
help !
help !
somebody help !
arminius !
there was an ambush .
a group of saxons .
murderer !
how can you accuse me?
what reason would i have to kill a man who's done us so much good?
envy , and guilt , and greed !
with siegfried dead , you wouldn't have to face your own weakness and dishonour .
and with him dead , you could keep the hoard for yourself !
all of it .
the hoard !
i don't want it anymore !
you always wanted the gold for yourself !
that's why you slew him !
we planned it together !
you'll never have the gold !
but the gold is my nibelung birth right !
you insolent son of a dwarf !
keep out of this , boy !
he murdered our king !
i order you to arrest him !
those who ally themselves with me , will be rewarded with gold " from the hoard " .
and finally betrayed as he betrayed me !
hagen of tronje , face the fate my gods have chosen !
your gods are dead !
soon we will know !
return this ring to it's rightful owner .
take it back to the nibelungs .
d ave day yah fryn dr .
dayre syolw ra ith sama .
arminius .
today the old gods live again !
no , giselher .
today the old gods will die with them .
