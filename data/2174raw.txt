radio's nonoperational .

looks like colonel hohlback left in a hurry .
what the hell is that?
i'd say we've got company .
horton !
you and otter locate the reactors and fire them up .
what is that?
outpost incinerator .
move away from the door !
why are you still here , soldier?
probably because no one lit the furnace .
captain v. j. dax .
says here he's a big hero .
combat medals , bronze stars , purple heart , purple heart , purple heart .
federal medal of valour at widowmakers .
that's a lot of crap .
wounded four times , refused numerous battlefield commissions ...
give me that .
some hero .
you murdered colonel hohlback?
he had his morita and a sidearm .
i just used my hands .
you're a disgrace to the uniform .
he's a mad dog .
he stays in the cage .
just remember , lieutenant , every dog has its day !
sarge !
hostiles !
i am in command here , private .
now , how many and what's our situation?
looks like a whole damn circus .
let's go .
trooper !
shelter !
right perimeter , spread wide !
you three , follow me .
he's spreading us too thin !

they're shifting their lines !

in about 15 seconds ...
all right , you son of a bitch ...
shield your eyes at count zero !
pass the word !
get off your ass , there's a war going on .
you two !
with me on flank !
perimeter burn in 10 seconds .
perimeter burn in 10 seconds .
look out !
come on !
three .
two .
one .
zero .
perimeter burn .
i need two volunteers .
who do you think you are?
the big stick that's running this show .
i'll go .
me too .
if we're not back inside of five minutes , it means more bugs are on the way .
you mean we didn't kill them all?
you never kill them all , son .
all right , who's got ...?
a light .
otter , take a knee .
you see those busted wires there?
yes , sir .
you got the wiggle room , kid .
splice them together .
trooper , hand me that ...
where's your knife?
i must have lost it , sir .
anyone who loses his knife in my unit would be strung up for lashes , kid .
you want to be careful with the red wire .
we got movement !
horton , illumination round .
hold your fire , we're coming through !
it's the general .
i see him !
he's bringing home two .
he's bringing home three .
wonder who didn't make it .
hope it wasn't goldy .
he was nice to me on my first day .
it's those little things that count .
yeah , like doing your goddamn job .
hostiles !
right on your general's ass !
come on , kid !
outstanding .
that stinks !
you get so you like it after a while .
son , i'll never forget it .
me neither , sir .
what kind of a hole do you think i am?
put her there !
welcome back , sir .
i don't know who you are , but you're aces with me .
it's nothing personal , general .
i'm just doing my job .
hey , fellas , let me give you a hand .
hell , i got a dog back home weighs more than she does .
well , look what the cat drug in !
you should see that damn cat !
we're in the shitter , huh?
we got a chance .
good to see you .
want the bad news or the bad news?
i almost forgot your knife .
keep it , kid .
no , i couldn't .
trooper needs a knife .
officers just tell troopers where to die .
that's not really true , is it , sir?
watch out for officers , son .
it's their job to get you killed .
first wave came in , and deke and slater were killed .
came in again and that ...
that kid goldy was gone .
and then it was just ... ... me and o'hara .
that magnificent son of a bitch .
we held them .
i tell you , this ... ... star don't mean a hill of beans when you're caught between shit and sweat .
and then these two beautiful bastards show up .
these two here , and they're carrying a couple of grenades ... ... and they got a boatload of gumption .
and they saved my sorry ass !
and i'd like to introduce you to them .
this is corporal joe griff , medical corps .
and this is technical sergeant ari peck .
and i can't tell you a thing about sleeping beauty over here ... ... because she snored through the whole damn thing .
that's private soda , sir .
she didn't sleep after our unit got chopped down .
found peck the next day , what , about five days ago?
everybody's gotta sleep sometime .
what's your story , peck?
32nd tech brigade , sole survivor , sir !
that's me .
been out there about a month , near as i can tell .
that's a long time .
pretty long , yeah .
i guess .
well , then , we got to get you home .
lieutenant dill .
yes , sir !
has pickup been arranged?
sergeant peck , can i talk to you?
yes , sir?
you think you can make this com talk and squawk like it ought to?
well , you can bet i'll die trying , sir .
get some sleep and try later .
oh , no , no .
i'll get on this right now .
that's outstanding , sergeant !
you're a credit to your mobile infantry unit .
thank you .
when is the last time you took a shower?
let's worry about the sniff factor after we get our asses unslung .
yes , sir .
we could sit pretty tight if we could shut this door , sergeant .
i'll get someone on it .
at least there's one man looking in the right direction .
yes , sir .
what's wrong with her , corporal?
it's the wind , sir .
dries out the membranes .
she'll be fine when she wakes up .
she's got the right idea .
good night , troopers .
get some sleep , all of you !
that's an order .
and , dill ...
yes , sir .
i want a full report of today's action when i wake up ... ... explaining how you got five of my troopers killed .
yes , sir .
you heard the man .
hit the sack !
not you , trooper .
yes , sir?
letting that criminal loose is a court martial offence , private .
i thought he could help us .
you thought the judgment of a murderer was preferable to an officer's?
well , that'll make for a hell of a compelling defence .
i wasn't thinking , sir .
it was intuition .
intuition?
i had no idea you were psychic .
i scored high when i was a kid , sir .
really?
why aren't you wearing the black?
i became inconsistent , sir .
onset of puberty?
it happens to you women .
when is it gonna happen to you?
excuse me?
puberty .
i hear it's a necessary step on the way to becoming a man .
you're addressing an officer of the federation .
shove that officer crap up your buster brown .
an officer who behaves as you did today ... ... and takes it out on a trooper ain't a man !
i'm not a man?
what kind of a man turns his back on the federation?
i'm glad you asked .
i trained a generation of people to throw themselves into the grinder .
the federation chewed them up and spit them out .
so now when they say , " push on to glory , " i say , " what glory?
what would you know about glory?
you call yourself a hero?
no , son .
that's something other people call you , and it's really just a trick .
when you throw your life away , instead of fool , they call you hero .
and as for glory , ask her .
she'll tell you everything you need to know !
how dare you?
just one man's opinion .
no , it's not .
it's treason !
then maybe you ought to shoot me .
now , there's something we agree on .
well , go ahead .
take out that popgun and have at it , soldier .
i believe in the rules and regulations that the federation stands for .
very good , lieutenant !
but you left out the kids .
what?
cowards .
they always hide behind rules and children .
i'll see you hang !
just so long as it's regulation rope .
oh , let's see .
got your mystery meat sticks , egg caps , hardtack , beans .
insta veggie meal , choco pudding delite .
sweet tooth , huh?
taps in 15 minutes .
i'll get you !
nice to have you with us , trooper .
you've been out for a long time .
how you feeling?
i feel good , sir .
you fit for duty?
raring to go .
well , that's outstanding .
what's the eta on a door we can shut , gentlemen?
well , sir , i think that should do it .
if you'll hold on ...
watch out for the cables !
the cables .
stop it !
stop it !
do it , do it , do it .
shit .
great , you welded the damn thing open .
you idiots .
all personnel to the perimeter .
troopers , you heard the man .
let's go !
get moving !
take that weapon .
come on .
sandee , horton , soda , brick , come on , you lazy bastards .
let's move it .
move , move , move , move !
sahara .
you two over there , you two front and running .
where's my op?
man your post !
go , go , go !
what's wrong?
general , there's something ...
move !
scouting parties , sir , 100 metres out .
when they figure that fence is down ... ... they're gonna show up like relatives to a rich man's funeral .
let there be light .
yeah .
yeah !
here we go .
we got power .
that's what i'm talking about .
i can see you now .
hey , general?
peck , is this your doing?
it's a little wonky ... ... but it'll hold .
i hope .
you have our tremendous gratitude , peck .
oh , it was nothing , sir .
i'll get back to work on the com now .
attaboy , peck .
way to go , peck .
peck .
peck .
peck .
all right .
dax , the charges against you are serious ... ... but i can't afford to lose a man of your experience .
give me your word as an officer you'll do your duty .
i'm no longer an officer , general , but i'll give you my word as a man .
your rank is restored until your guilt or innocence ... ... is determined by a hearing .
well , i can assure you i killed colonel hohlback .
then i guarantee you'll hang , but until then , i expect you to do your duty .
yes , sir .
i want forward op .
three watches a day .
fences fail , troopers get lazy .
you carry on , captain .
yes , sir .
something i can do for you?
i just came to say thanks for saving my ass .
that's the job .
how come you don't sleep inside like everyone else?
i figure this is where the enemy will show up .
no telling what kind of fun you could get in out here , huh?
are you flirting with me , soldier?
no , sir , i don't flirt .
never?
never ever , sir .
well , you're the real deal .
the genuine article .
and you want some action .
you'll get all the action you want after the bugs show up .
you know ... ... it's all the waiting that gets me .
oh , i see .
you need something to occupy your mind .
come here .
that's good right there .
drop and give me 100 .
sir?
you got a lot of energy , trooper .
now get down and start counting .
yes , sir .
one , two , three , four ... ... five , six , seven ...
make it 200 .
you lose something?
yo , you're the new guy , so i ...
can we play too?
i got mess duty .
thanks for the wake up , soda .
pleasure .
you sure you know what you're doing?
oh , i got a pretty good idea , but ... ... you know , practice does make perfect .
nice .
come on , billie .
no , no , forget it , sandee .
he's a jerk .
hey , sandee ...
what's with her?
horton's with the new girl .
sipping some soda .
ain't war hell?
who goes there?
horton?
oh , it's you .
sorry .
you okay?
no .
anything i can do?
no .
at least let me take a look at that cut on your chin .
this?
it's just a scratch .
general wants everybody tiptop .
hey , joe?
yeah?
how long have you been out here?
all my life , it seems like .
yeah , i know what you mean .
i've been here for eight months , and i've only seen the sun twice .
might be a little easier if you took your helmet off , jill .
god , what happened to your fingers?
you know , muzzle burn .
that looks really bad .
hey , who's the medic here anyway , huh?
hey , joe .
yeah?
has anybody ever told you what a nice smile you have?
yeah .
probably .
feeling better?
no .
do you want to?
what happened to her , corporal?
just a nosebleed , sir .
she's gonna be fine .
how do you feel?
you know how i feel .
what gives?
it looks like we got a couple new couples .
no wonder we're losing this war .
everyone's fucking instead of fighting .
what are you looking at?
get back to work .
i'll get to work .
good morning , captain .
what makes you think so?
why , are we in for it?
sooner or later .
you got time for breakfast?
you're welcome to join me , as long as you don't expect cheerful conversation .
not a morning person , huh?
no , i'm a miserable , murdering bastard .
and that's on a good day .
what's a bad day like?
any one day in particular you're interested in?
no .
that second lieu y send you to question me?
lieutenant dill?
he thinks i'm an idiot .
are you?
me?
yeah .
definitely .
trust me , i got you beat .
well , i fell in love , and i got busted down from corporal for fraternisation .
so who wants to be a corporal?
here's the idiot part .
he got killed .
you really some kind of psychic?
yeah .
maybe .
i guess .
not like dill , not psi corps .
well , your fella ... ... did you know he was gonna buy the farm?
it doesn't work that way .
well , that's good , i guess .
maybe that's why i don't believe in all that bunk .
those tags belong to the troopers that you lost ... ... and you wear them because you feel responsible for what happened .
that's a lucky guess .
why'd you kill your co?
you tell me .
i'm not that good .
he gave some stupid orders that got kids killed .
one day too many , or too many one day .
maybe i'm the wheel that broke .
you ought to forgive yourself .
it's war .
don't spend too much time around me , trooper .
i'd hate to end up wearing your tags .
stupid bug .
you're relieved .
thanks .
hey ...
hey , trooper?
who's that?
peck .
hey , sarge , what do you need?
well , i could use a hand .
buddy , anything i can do for you is aces by me .
you think you could lie down on the fl ...?
the floor?
floor .
and reach behind the cons ...
i got it , i got it .
you want me to lay on the floor and reach behind the console .
okay .
here we go .
son of a ...
how's this?
oh , god !
help !
gotta keep quiet .
help !
help !
we got com .
we got com .
this is hotel delta 185 to fleet rescue .
come in , fleet rescue .
this is hotel delta 185 to fleet rescue .
this is ...
how's that report coming?
well , i'm not so much writing a report as building your gallows , dax .
i didn't take you for a carpenter .
shift to command frequency .
there was this other carpenter a few thousand years ago ... ... a better man than you or me .
well , that carpentry business was the death of him .
be careful of what you build and what crosses you bear .
hotel delta 185 to fleet command .
lieutenant .
roger , hotel delta , this is fleet command .
over .
this is the 701 st mobile infantry , bravo company , requesting pickup .
tak e a number , ml .
we got stragglers all over the planet .
what's your name , sailor?
fleet lieutenant mary klinghof .
getting smart won't help you , jarhead .
you listen up , fruit fly .
this is general jack gordon shepherd .
and if somebody doesn't make this pickup their priority ... ... i'm gonna make it my priority to come down ... ... and chew out some fleet ass , starting with you .
sorry , sir , i didn't know who i was talking to .
that's because you're a moron .
yeah .
yes , sir , but we got a lot of wounded out there .
the wounded come first .
any excuses after that come out of your butt .
shepherd , out .
where's peck?
i'm gonna give him a medal .
asleep , sir .
dead on his feet .
well , he's earned it .
any day on that door , brick .
we're all waiting for something , sarge .
but it ain't the door .
outstanding .
not you , trooper .
lucky guess .
we're all gonna die .
what would you know about glory?
it doesn't work that way .
lf he won't fight , shoot him !
no !
sahara .
i haven't seen him .
wak e up .
the wheel that brok e .
wak e up .
wak e up .
give me a little more .
don't be shy .
come on .
yeah .
oh , trouble at the trough .
it's gonna get ugly .
what's eating tor , huh?
not you .
yeah , i guess you're right .
war does some weird things to people .
everything okay?
no , i'm ...
yeah , i'm fine .
you look a little shaky , trooper .
yeah , something's not right .
that's what they call it when you're behind enemy lines .
it feels worse than that .
oh , is this another one of your psychic hot flashes?
it seems like tor has changed .
because he wouldn't take brick's bait?
about time .
it seems sudden , sarge .
like you puking your guts out?
i guess i'm coming down with something .
i wonder what that could be?
there's a big knot ... ... where my stomach used to be .
sarge , i barely touched the medic's hand just now , and i saw something .
you saw something?
something terrible .
maybe you're just going crazy .
i love you too , sarge .
girls get wacky when they're pregnant .
suddenly , they know everything about everything .
oh , jesus .
yeah , you're about as psychic as a doorknob , trooper .
you ready?
i'm kind of tired .
i'll give you a hand .
oh , thanks .
oh , my shoe .
don't worry about it .
are you scared to shower , otter?
what does it matter?
we're going home in a few hours anyway .
hi , guys .
holy god , what the ...?
oh , god .
oh , god .
open the door !
open the door !
we're gonna die in here !
open the door !
captain , i need to talk to you , but it's gonna sound crazy .
well , spit it out , trooper .
look , sir ... ... i know i'm not really supposed to be psychic ... ... but i have this terrible feeling .
yes , sir .
as you were .
we have a situation here that requires the attention of military intelligence .
tell him .
this morning , in the mess ... ... i accidentally touched griff's hand .
i might've had a vision .
playing psychic again , private?
could you keep an open mind here , lieutenant?
this trooper's got information that's vital .
some of the troopers have been acting a little strange lately .
describe what you saw .
he wasn't a man .
he was some other thing .
maybe 1000 things .
somehow he was connected ... ... to tor and sandee and horton and that new girl , soda .
i've always been pretty fuzzy , sir , and this came through sharp as a knife .
lieutenant , i know i'm not a real psychic like you .
in fact , i just found out i'm pregnant , and i didn't have a clue .
you're pregnant?
yes , sir , i'm afraid so .
you might be interested to know that in our studies ... ... pregnancy has been shown to heighten psychic ability .
that's too bad because i'd really like to be wrong .
yes , me too , but i keep having the same feeling .
what is it?
they're coming to wipe us out .
what's so new about that?
i mean the whole species , everything human .
and they have a plan .
look , after what i did in the battle ... ... i wasn't very sure of myself anymore .
and i just figured everybody thought i'd just cracked .
yesterday , i might have been inclined to agree ... ... but that would've been me screwing up , lieutenant .
thank you , sir .
i'll get on this matter with general shepherd immediately .
oh , and , trooper ... ... that was some good work .
sir .
general shepherd?
what are you doing in here?
general jack and i were just having a chat .
what are you doing here , dill?
you and shepherd?
is that so hard to believe?
general?
general shepherd?
general ...
they're inside of you .
oh , god .
back up , or i'll drill your damn skull .
get back !
get away from the door .
get away .
you bastards .
you're all under arrest ... ... for murder , sedition , for treason against the federation ...
oh , and you're gonna pay because we're not gonna kill you .
oh , no .
no , you see , we got special places for things like you ... ... where they cut you up .
but they keep you alive while they cut you up ... ... so they can see what makes you tick , and they'll see what makes you sick .
and i'll be there .
oh , yeah , i'm gonna be there to see ...
you're under arrest , dax .
on what charge?
murder .
captain dax , what's happening?
no talking to the prisoner .
keep him covered .
you gave me your word , dax .

it's not you and me .
it's gonna happen to all of us .
you trying to make a baby with my barracks door , private?
sahara , she don't want it , but i gotta give her the bug .
there's a wire loose in your head .
no , it's a little piece of god .
not like the one people used to believe in , or the federation ... ... and it's filling me up .
i can sort of feel myself floating away .
kid , you're not making any sense .
you'll understand when you wake up .
when i wake up?

inside me .
sergeant , no !

keys .
what the hell kind of bug is that?
jesus .
one that gets inside and takes over .
maybe it can tell us something .
what are you talking about?
everything that happened here was supposed to happen .
the bugs brought us here to create a weapon .
what kind of weapon?
shepherd !
he could bring this to the top of the federation !
we gotta kill the general .
fire in the hole !
you're gonna die !
they don't kill so easy , do they?
you're gonna die !
they're not like us , sir .
not anymore .
they're bugs .
you're gonna die !
you're gonna die !
they shut down the reactors .
sandee?
grenade !
sahara , you okay?
poor creatures .
why must we destroy you?
i'll tell you why .
order is the tide of creation ... ... but yours is a species ... ... that worships the one over the many .
you glorify your intelligence ... ... because it allows you to believe anything .
that you have a destiny .
that you have a right .
that you have a cause .
that you are special .
that you are great .
but in truth ... ... you are born insane .
and such misery ... ... cannot be allowed ... ... to spread .
kill them all !
sahara !
you get the general !
general shepherd !
that's me !
you can't take him !
whatever you do , don't let him onboard !
hey , general !
listen up .
she needs medical attention .
you just killed a general officer , mister !
lots of generals out there , flyboy !
this trooper's got information vital to the survival of the federation !
she must reach safety at all costs !
you get me?
yes , sir !
let's go !
there are too many of them , dax !
you gotta tell them what you saw .
you gotta tell them about the new bug !
you stay here , you'll die !
murderers don't go home .
dax !
dax !
dax .
more than a soldier , not just a man .
a hero of the federation .
shed no tears for me .
my glory lives forever .
and now you too can live the glory ... ... because it's easy to be a hero in the mobile infantry .
men and women lik e you are signing up every day ... ... to serve the federation and save the galaxy !
isn't it time you did your part?
beautiful baby , ma'am .
thank you , sergeant .
think how impressed friends and teachers will be !
everyone loves a citizen !
little trooper likes me .
sign up , and one day they'll call you a hero too !

shed no tears for me .
my glory lives forever .
