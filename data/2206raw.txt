twelve members .

it's a steal at this price .
that's if you want it .
but we're gonna have to make an offer today .
the owner's highly motivated .
think it over .
i'll make some calls . take a look around .
okay .
thank you , brian .
thank you very much .
it's okay .
we're just gonna look .
my god .
here you are .
we were just making sure there was adequate closet space .
good .
well , this house is yours if you want it ... but you have to decide right now .
we'll take it .
really?
oh , my god !
you know what i kept thinking when we were looking at that house?
that we should get a mattress for that closet .
i kept thinking that it felt like a dream come true .
come here .
how fast can you drive this thing?
really fast .
let's see .
okay .
we bought a really , really ...
excuse me .
we bought a house .
we bought a big house .
mary !
mary !

mary , talk to me .

can you hear me?
jesus christ !
hold on , darling .
911 , there's been an accident .
yes .
you okay?
you didn't see it , did you?
seewhat?
what did you see?
i didn't see anything .
john .
there's something wrong with me .
it's called a glioblastoma .
it's a temporal lobe tumor .
according to the doctor , it's extremely rare .
600, 000 gets this thing .
did they say it was a result ofthe accident?
no , it turns out ... that it's been there a while .
there's nothing else they can do?
no , no .
they did the surgery , and they couldn't get it all out , so they'll ... keep her on the chemo ... as long as her strength holds out .
that's working .
i think she's looking better now .
good .
that's good .
two weeks ago ... we were house hunting .
one day you're just driving along in your car and the universe ... just points at you and says ...
ah , there you are , a happy couple .
i've been looking for you .
i've been looking for you " .
i'm sorry .
for what?
for all of this .
i feel like i ruined everything .
you didn't ruin anything .
not a damn thing .
i want you to be happy .
you didn'tsee it , did you?
yes .
yeah?
she knew .
what?
she was drawing angels .
two years later .
it was the meanness of the campaigns ... the almost complete lack of candor and honesty ... that turned the voters off ..
i think that these parties are demonizing each other .
they're projecting our own personal fears and anxieties ... onto the national stage .
people don't like it .
people are very , very unsatisfied at the moment .
it makes them complacent because they don't see any possibility of change .
2004 ...
is there a dark horse candidate out there for the democrats?
well , i'm hearing a lot about russ mccallum .
governor of virginia .
yeah , he might do what carter ...
hey , i told her to watch .
who?
peter's friend gwen .
she'll be there tonight .
oh , god .
look , i don't think i'm gonna be able to make that one tonight .
come on , you can't keep blowing this thing off .
i'm not .
i've got an interview with the governor .
i gotta be in richmond at 8 : 00 in the morning .
i almost forgot .
mccallum's office called .
they bumped the meeting till tomorrow night .
eddie , look , i ... she's not mary .
not by a mile .
but you know what?
no one everwill be .
hey , ed .
i'm sorry about today .
i'm sure gwen is very nice .
maybe some other time .
it's about 1 : 00 in the morning .
i'm a little wired , so i'm driving down to richmond tonight .
i'll talk to you tomorrow .
bye .
hi .
i'm sorry .
i know it's really late , but my car broke down just up the road .
i wondered if i could use the phone .
hello .
it's him .
i been waitin 'for you .
you son of a & $ % # @ .
what are you doin '?
get the door !
get the door !
just stay right there .
mister , i don't know who you ...
shut up !
honey ...
connie's here .
well , hey , gordon .
how you doin '?
okay , why don't you just ... put down the gun and tell me what's going on here .
yeah .
he's come around three nights in a row .
this son of a bitch is stalking us .
i'm john klein .
my car broke down ...
let's let gordon finish , mr. klein .
two nights ago ... at 2 : 30 in the a . m . there's a bang on the door .
i open it up , and here's this guy .
he says he wants to use the phone .
but there's something creepy about him ... so i tell him to get lost .
last night at 2 : 30 on the dot , guess who's back .
you're sure it was mr. klein here?
i am absolutely positive . it's mr. klein .
crazy .
this is ...
i am not crazy .
i didn't say that you ...
so then what happened?
i warned him off my property .
i used the word " trespass " , and he still came back .
you're lucky i'm a christian , because i had the right to shoot you on my porch .
he'd have to been inside the house , gordon .
what?
fine .
so tonight i figured the dumb & % $ # might come back , and sure enough , there he is .
its imposible .
it wasn't me .
i don't know what's happening here .
something's very wrong here .
i don't know these people .
i have never been here before .
i'm from dc .
look .
it's a wallet , okay?
wallet?
i'm from dc .
my name is john klein .
washington post?
yes .
yes .
can i get out of this shower now?
you can wait for me outside , mr. klein .
we'll run a check on him .
anyone else comes by , forget the gun .
just call me .
just find out what he wants .
so , you didn't actually see the guy before tonight?
no .
but i heard the knocking .
three nights in a row .
i'll talk to you tomorrow .
i'm gonna give you a ride into town , unless you wanna sleep in your car .
i can call for a tow in the morning .
you're a long way from dc .
what are you doing here?
driving through .
we're not on the way to anyplace , mr. klein .
i recognize you .
dc review .
you watch that?
we're not all bumpkins .
so i'm not under arrest?
you didn't steal anything .
you didn't hurt anybody .
no breaking and entering .
you've had trouble with him before?
gordy and denise?
no .
they're good people .
things have just been a little strange around here lately .
you still haven't told me what you're doing here in the middle of the night .
i don't know .
where am i?
think you could show me where we are on the map here?
we're right on the state line .
with ohio .
what time did you leave dc?
1 : 00 in the morning .
if i was doing 80 the whole way , it would've taken me six hours to get here .
there's gotta be a logical explanation .
i don't know .
by the way , don't worry about your pal the governor .
i'll take care of it .
yeah .
okay .
thanks , eddie .
so?
it's running fine , mr. klein .
can't find a thing wrong with her .
really?
strange .
all right , what do i owe you?
nothin .
i said i can't find anything wrong with her .
mr. smallwood .
mr. smallwood ...
i just wanted to apologize for that misunderstanding we had last night .
are you sure it was me that came by the last couple of nights?
listen , mister .
connie called me .
she told me that you check out , and that's good enough for me .
i'm perfectly willing to let it go .
but i don't drink anymore ... and i don't lie .
and as far as i know , i'm not crazy .
so if you're accusing me ...
look , here's the thing .
i don't know how i ended up here last night .
i didn't even know i was in west virginia .
some how , between 1 : 00 and 2 : 30 ...
i traveled 400 miles and ended up on that road by your house ... and i've got no memory of it .
and you call me crazy?
i was afraid i'd see you here .
okay .
you didn't show up .
too bad .
i really wanted to know what i look like .
sergeant , i'm curious .
last night you said ... things had been strange ... around here lately .
what kind of things?
you really don't want to know .
now i really need to know .
just your odd reports .
people seeing things they can't explain , so they all come to me .
'cause you're the cop .
because they know me .
you know , if there are other people in this town ... who are feeling as ... confused as i am right now ...
i'd sure like to hear it .
the past few months , people have been coming up to me ... and reporting that they've been seeing strange things .
i don't mean the town speed freak .
i mean good , honest , church going people .
i've known these folks my entire life ... and they seem down right embarrassed to be bringing it up .
bringing what up?
it's hard to explain .
weird lights .
strange phone calls , you .
i heard a crack ...
a very strange sensation .
reds eyes .
as a moth " .
lights and calls phone strange .
you .
seeing a ufo is one thing .
what do you do when someone tells you they saw this in their backyard?
what is it?
my wife died two years ago .
she saw something .
drew pictures .
who showed you this?
it was right here .
there was only a foot or so
between its head and that branch .
that makes it about ... eight feet tall .
yeah .
i was getting ready for bed and just .
happened to glance out the window .
at first all i could see ... were these two red eyes .
i kept looking at it .
i couldn't stop .
i've never had that feeling before , like i couldn't move .
and then i guess itjust ... took off ..
that may not make much sense , but it's ... the only way i can put it into words .
you didn't see it , did you?
it started about two months ago .
every time i answered the phone i'd hear it .
the first one was just a loud beeping noise .
now they're mostly .
these creaking , howling sounds .
they all like this?
well , once it was a man talking really fast .
what'd he say?
i couldn't make it out .
some foreign language .
have you had the line checked?
i even had our number changed .
but before i got a chance to give it out to anyone ... the calls started again .
it's not a question of believing them .
like i said , they're honest people .
how long you lived here?
my whole life .
i grew up right over that hill .
on a farm?
shucks , no .
a real live house .
indoor plumbing and everything .
sorry .
we even had shoes for church and schoolin 'and stuff .
all right , all right .
where the hell are you?
i'm still here .
west virginia?
yeah .
yeah .
something's come up .
you're kidding .
something of national interest in west virginia?
no , scientific .
i'll tell you about it later .
cy's beginning to look rabid .
keep him at bay , okay?
are you okay?
you sounda little stressed .
no , i'm fine .
i'll talk to you later .
we were parked up here ... and sort a making out in the back seat .
and what happened next ... is sort of hard to explain .
next day , i woke up and ... both my ... my eyes were swelled up .
what did the doctors say?
he couldn't explain it .
see this one here?
it ain't never healed .
we're getting engaged .
that's good .
yes , talk me?
talk me?
i gotta talk to you .
okay .
mr. klein .
hello .
i want to speak with you .
ok .
last night i woke up ... with the worst headache
i've ever had in my life .
i went into the bathroom .
to get some aspirin ... and i happened .
to look in the mirror ... and ...
i swear to god ...
i see something ...
i can't describe .
but it sure as hell ... is not my reflection .
and then ...
i hear ... this weird ... howl ... coming out of the sink .
and there's a voice .
it's a voice ... and it's saying ...
do not be afraid .
ninety nine will die .
denver nine " .
i even wrote it down .
he just keeps saying the same thing over and over for an hour ... and then it stops .
and when i wake up this morning i look at this piece of paper ... } where i wrote down the words ... and this thing is on it .
i did not draw that .
denver 9 .
99 they will die .
gordon?
what?
gordon , you ... your ear's bleeding .
this cat scan is clean , gordon .
no sign of any physical problem .
are you sure?
because this man's wife had a tumor .
what you had , gordon , was a first class migraine .
i can write you a prescription .
that'd be good .
thank you , doctor .
there were other symptoms , doc .
he had hallucinations , heard voices .
aren't they both associated with glioblastoma?
i see nothing here to suggest ... something as exotic as glioblastoma , mr. klein ... but if you'd like i can refer mr. smallwood to another neurologist ... for a second opinion .
he's wrong .
no , that'd be fine .
thank you very much .
gordon !
wait .
wait .
he's not wrong .
nothing's wrong .
nothing's wrong .
he's not wrong 'cause there's nothing wrong .
there's nothing wrong .
you go to a doctor with a bleeding ear . and he tells you you got a headache ...
yes , well , you're not sick , so that is good news .
i wish i was sick .
then i would know why this is happening .
you shouldn't say things like that .
you should not say that .
what should i say , denise?
i'm hallucinating .
i'm hearing voices .
was your wife hearing voices before she had her tumor?
no .
13 news is headed to the scene , and we'll have a live report in minutes .
again our top story , domain air .
flight 9 out of denver has crashed .
an airline representative is expected to make a statement shortly .
there is no confirmation ... but all 99 passengers and crew members are believed dead .
wow , man .
could i speak to alexander leek , please?
this is leek .
mr. leek , this is john klein .
i'm working on a pretty strange story .
i was hoping you might be able to help me out .
i'm particularly interested in your theories on precognition and prophecies .
anything you want to know is in the book .
yeah , but the ... chapter that you have . on the entities you call ...
were you contacted ... or are you pretending to have a professional interest?
yeah ...
no .
i'm a reporter for the washington post .
well , i'm sorry , mr. klein .
i don't work in those areas anymore .
i don't understand .
to hear a voice is one thing ... but this isn't just a message , it's a prediction .
it came true .
these things gordon's having , are they dreams or hallucinations?
the way he describes them , they sound like dreams .
i don't know .
he believes they're real .
i had a dream like that .
yeah?
it was nighttime ... and i was in the middle of the ocean .
i was trying to swim , but i was too cold .
i kept looking ...
i kept looking for something ... to hang on to .
and there were presents ... floating all around me .
they were wrapped up .
they were tied with bows .
i tried to grab on to them , but they kept popping away .
and then i started to sink ...
like a stone .
there was nothing i could do .
i was falling .
but it felt good .
i was letting go .
i was letting myself go and ... all i could see ... was black ... and all i could feel . was the darkness above me and the lights ... coming from below .
i knew i was dying .
and then
i heard this voice .
like somebody whispering in my ear .
wake up , number 37 " .
wake up
and then i woke up .
what do you think that means?
number 37?
i have absolutely no idea .
i met him .
the guy who told me about the plane crash .
you met him?
yeah .
i met him .
last night , coming home from work about midnight .
i'm driving past the cement plant ... out bythe chemical factory .
right .
something happened .
bright ...
lightning .
something encircles me .
everything's kind ofhot .
i feel like i can't catch ... catch my breath .
he looked human .
but there was just something ... wrong about him .
that's when i heard the voice .
the same voice that i heard two nights ago .
he said ...
do not be afraid .
my name ... is indrid
cold " .
and he said to me ...
in a place this size .
equator .
three hundred .
three hundred will die .
wait for me .
i will return .
i will see you in time " .
and that was it .
gordon , all that ...
it's a iittle ...
have a look .
earthquake in ecuator .
more than three hundred deads .
she knew .
i didn't see anything .
you want to hear the chief's latest phone call?
yes , sure .
$ % & #
yes?
thank god you're there .
gordon?
i know i sounded crazy the other day , but things are getting weird out here .
slow down , gordon .
he's here .
who's here?
indrid cold .
he's standing right next to me .
get over to gordon's right away .
he says indrid cold is there .
gordon?
let me talk to him .
sure .
hang on .
hello , john klein .
who is this?
my name is indrid cold .
unless , of course , you're gordon smallwood .
your father was born in racine , wisconsin .
he lived in a green house on monroe street .
you don't remember how your mother looked .
okay you got my attention .
where's my watch?
in your shoe .
under the bed .
very good , john .
thank you .
what's in my hand?
chap stick .
you're reading my mind , aren't you?
did you read my mind?
i have no need to , do i?
what's the third line of page 51?
a broken smile beneath her whispered wings " .
still more proof , john klein?
what do you look like?
it depends on who's looking .
i want to meet you .
you already have , john .
i have seen you afraid .
you're afraid right now , aren't you?
can ... can i ask you something?
why ask me what you already know , john?
when?
why?
what happened to my wife?
you were there .
mary klein cannot be found by looking .
you will see her in time .
gordon !
what's up , connie?
everything okay?
did you just call john?
no .
i've been asleep since 9 : 00 .
unless , of course , you're gordon smallwood .
see?
it's sticking up here around 1, 950 cycles per second .
but it never gets any lower than maybe 1, 930 or so .
but yours is way down here in the normal vocal range ... anywhere between 1, 000 and 1, 200 cycles per second .
okay , so this guy's vocal range . is much higher than mine .
what makes you think it's a man?
still more proof , john klein?
he was not the looked for element .
what is it?
near as i can tell , it's ... an electrical impulse .
but whatever it is , it's not coming from human vocal cords .
why ask me what you already know , john?
what happened to my wife?
you were there .
mary klein cannot be found by looking .
you will see her in time .
the capacity to see the future .
it is not characteristic of you , john
this isn't like you .
we used to rip on this stuff . when it came over the wire .
yeah , i know .
it's different when it happens to you .
do me a favor . talk to cyrus today .
tell him you got the flu .
any excuse .
