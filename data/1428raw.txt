mexlko 20 miles southwest of tijuana
last night i had an ugly nightmare .
oh , yeah?
what happened , man?
im lying down in my bed .
then i get up ... and theres my mother , may she rest in peace ... seated in a chair with a plastic bag over her head ... and she cant breathe .
and i cant help her .
fuck .
what do we do?
weil give them a halfhour .
who are they?
dont worry .
itsjust the police .
this is a private road .
you have to have a permit .
do you have a permit?
i dont have a permit .
do you have a permit?
well , then , we have a problem .
can we buy a permit?
yeah , but its gonna cost you .
how much?
four hundred pesos .
you too 400 pesos .
whats underneath the tarp?
boxes of food .
show me .
lay down on the ground , sweetie .
youre under arrest .
yeah , you guys are screwed !
whats your name?
javier rodrguez rodrguez .
youve done an excellent job .
but weil take over from here .
put the prisoners in the suburban and impound the truck .
how did you find out about this?
a little bird told me .
whats the name of your little bird?
it doesnt have a name .
those fucking anonymous ones !
for an officer of the state police ... youre verywell informed .
hey , was that general salazar?
the big boss himself .
what is he doing around here?
up to something .
i dont know .
they took our handcuffs , manolo .
we want you to come with us .
where?
its just a short trip .
follow me .
not you .
you !
iil wait here .
five years with the tijuana police .
three years in the state police .
your parents died when their house fooded in the rains of93 .
how unfortunate .
you make $316 a month .
thats what they pay .
well , look .
this could be your past .
we can talk about your future ... if you can do me a favor .
if i can .
i want to wipe out the tijuana cartel .
what can i do to help?
his name is francisco flores .
hes an assassin .
he runs guns for the tijuana cartel .
i have to talk to him .
i need you to find him and bring him here .
this is crazy !
dont freak out , manolo .
dont you know who " frankie flowers " is?
a hired assassin !
a psychopath !
fucking crazy !
who knows how many hes killed !
then iil go by myself .
and we cant ask for help ... because he lives in san diego .
it would be interesting to know how you did it so quickly .
we all have our weak side .
the path of the lord is very subtle .
amen .
we know that you killed our chief of intelligence .
we also know that you ... killed police chiefs in tijuana and mexico city .
why do you resist?
my father has money .
that is not the correct answer .
we also found out ... that you hunted down a neighbor of general salazar .
a poor peasant .
your people killed his granddaughter .
that was a stupid thing to do .
you fucked up .
my technique is more profound than yours , javier .
much more profound .
when he loves me like a father ... he will never tell anyone he was here .
he will give me the names of his superiors .
then we get them and they too will give us names .
and eventually somebody will get us to juan obregn .
and on that day , the tijuana cartel will fall .
what a disgrace .
its all right .
salazar is here .
youre among friends now .
this shameful treatment will stop immediately .
guard !
yes , general .
are you responsible for this?
we are not savages !
yes , general .
has he eaten?
i dont know , sir .
go get him some clothes .
yes , general .
javi .
a group of us are going to a party .
who?
esteban , guzmn , toms , all of them .
your new buddies .
yes .
lets go .
no .
itil be fun .
another day .
at my house i have some b& w speakers .
a while ago i bought a cd burner .
i make cds with the music i want .
just like i bought them in a store .
you and i have a lot in common .
not everything , but a lot .
we both studied on the other side with the gringos .
your father is an engineer , right?
my father may he rest in peace was also an engineer .
ive been into stereos since i was very young .
most people dont care .... but for me its very important .
in vino veritas .
wine brings out the truth .
use this to write down ... the addresses of those bastards who killed my captains .
and not where they were last week , but where they are now .
and better yet , where they are going to be tomorrow .
you know where they are going to be tomorrow , right?
yesterday , forces of the mexican army , acting on an anonymous tip . . .
joined with police to arrest members of the obregn brothers drug cartel .
head of the federal drug forces , gen.
arturo salazar , said in mexico city . . .
that the sweep was a crippling blow to the obregn brothers . . . who reportedly dominate the narcotics trade . . .
in the city of tijuana and the rest of baja california state .
general salazar went on to say that the authorities were working overtime . . .
to confirm that porfirio madrigal , head of the rival jurez cartel . . . died last week during a plastic surgery procedure .
here it is , here it is .
get out , asshole .
are you going to kill me?
no , the obregns will do that for us .
whats up , ana?
manolo never came home last night .
come in , come in .
sit down .
i dont know where he is .
he wasnt with you last night?
no
im worried .
dont worry too much .
it makes you ugly .
do you want a coffee?
coffee with sugar?
no
no?
look , javier .
i was going through his clothes the other day .
look what i found .
what is it?
what were you doing?
i was with friends from work .
was salazar there?
the general is going to mexico city next week ... and im not going to get left behind .
javier rodrguez
the word is youre not that happy in your work .
maybe we can help .
you two dont like me , do you?
miss , with all due respect , we dont have an opinion .
maybe its because im going to have ...
the nicest home youve ever seen in your miserable lives .
the old man actually kept his promise .
the general is a man of his word .
they will say anything to get what they want ... and then its always tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow .
occupational hazard , i guess .
the bags?
my love , its beautiful !
how beautiful !
how are you feeling?
good?
how handsome you are .
listen ... the scorpion is alive .
get in get in
porfirio madrigal isnt dead after all !
that means that salazar is working for the jurez cartel .
i cant believe this doesnt matter to you .
this is nothing new , manolo .
thats why salazar is so interested in cleaning up tijuana .
and he has plans for juan obregn , the bastard .
thats right .
you know how much money he would pay for this information?
how much?
a fuckload of money , partner .
whats up , man?
take off your glasses .
take off your glasses so i can see your eyes .
were going to keep our mouths shut .
okay .
whats going on?
you seem nervous .
because of manolo .
im afraid heil do something foolish and its going to get him killed .
why?
he says hes going to sell information to the dea .
theyre going to pay him a lot of money .
what could he tell the dea?
you know ... about salazar and madrigal .
javier ...
where is he right now?
i dont know .
he took his passport and left .
give me a kiss .
dont tell him that i told you .
whats up , manolo?
looks like youre waiting for someone .
im just looking for the waitress .
im ready to order .
do you want anything?
a fucking salad?
something to drink?
no , no .
calm down , calm down .
what are you gonna have ,
manolo?
a steak .
well , if you like steak ... we know a much better place .
you come with us .
javier had nothing to do with this .
it was all my idea .
punish me , not him .
do me a favor .
dont tell ana i died like this .
tell her it was something else .
something official .
tell her i died ... doing something worthy .
forgive me , javi .
put some muscle into it .
you too , manolo .
youre done .
get out of there .
dont you hear?
javier , put the shovel down .
get out .
lets go .
i told you it wasnt his fault .
shut up .
turn around .
lets go , javier .
its over .
dont be alarmed , javier .
the old man works like this .
we had to go through the same thing .
we had to do this to be sure we could trust you .
now we see that we can .
we are family now .
if manolo hadnt done what he did ... they wouldnt have been able to get salazar and madrigal .
he did something really good .
whats more , he did something important for tijuana .
i would like to believe you .
you dont have to believe me ... because its the truth .
the simple truth .
tomorrow im going to burn his clothes .
