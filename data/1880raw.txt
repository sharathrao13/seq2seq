bayonets .

grab their boots and rifles !
let's move on !
let's go !
that scarecrow ain't gonna frighten off no yankee .
or are you tryin 'to make a man for yourself?
no .
i come by ... a few days .
i don't pass by .
lookin 'out for you .
i know .
i see you .
and i don't like it .
where's your little servant girl?
ruby .
she tradin 'off more of your daddy's silver?
stop it !
her nose is in the butter .
her nose is right in your butter !
this farm's got my name on it !
you listenin ', woman?
you're gonna need more than a scarecrow !
sal .
afternoon .
don't spread out .
why are they spreadin 'out?
i never seen a man work a field with a shotgun before .
there's a war on .
get off my land .
your boys come home?
ain't seen my boys in four years .
they're out fightin 'other boys , not old men and women .
so you won't mind if we look around?
'cause we think they're here .
we think you've got 'em hid up somewhere .
what i gotta give you?
chicken?
lamb?
sure .
the thing is , you've only got one barrel .
and there's five of us .
that's not a fair fight .
king of kings !
hey !
what was that?
you're harboring deserters .
i could confiscate this farm and everything on it .
every plate , every sheep , every little pellet of chickenshit .
i could confiscate your old lady's asshole .
so don't you offer me no bird .
come on , boys !
mama's callin '!
mama !
no !
mama !
mama !

buggery and shit !
if i'da known you were this heavy , i'da left you in those chains .

darlin ', what?
she's sayin '" don't bother " !

sally !

this world won't stand long .
god won't let it ... stand this way long .
how long have i been sleepin '?
two days , three days .
not long enough .
i can't stop here .
sit down before you fall down .
i'm a deserter .
if they find me here , things could be bad for you .
what are they gonna do?
cut short my young life?
i've learned a person can pretty much survive off of a goat .
a goat gives you company , and milk , and cheese , and , when you need it , good meat .
that's my beauty .
there's my beauty .
so you been fightin '.
i could be at killin '... for days , my feet against the feet of my enemy .
and i always killed him .
he never killed me .
i don't know why .
gave it a try , to look at ya .
yeah , i guess he did .
see , i think there's a plan .
there's a design for each and every one of us .
you look at nature .
bird flies somewhere , picks up a seed , shits the seed out , plant grows .
bird's got a job , shit's got a job , seed's got a job .
and you've got a job .
you done good , goat .
you were a real beauty .
sometimes i think i'm crazy when i'm just hungry .
now drink this .
it eases the pain , and you'll sleep .
is she waitin 'for ya , this ada monroe?
she was .
i don't know .
or even if she knows me .
lie down .
i'm like the boy who goes for wood in winter and comes back in spring with a whistle .
like every fool sent off to fight with a flag and a lie .
that's the laudanum gettin 'to ya .
that's good .
say somethin 'more .
she got me a book .
ada monroe .
a man by the name of bartram .
he wrote about his travels .
sometimes ... just readin 'the name of a place ... near home ...
sorell cove .
bishop's creek .
those places belonged to people before us .
to the cherokee .
what did he call cold mountain?
how could a name ... not even a real name ... break your heart?
it's her .
she's the place i'm headin '.
and i hardly know her .
i hardly know her !
and i just can't seem to get back to her .
to have traveled so far .
from east to west .
a thousand terrible miles .
i have to close my eyes .
my feet treadin 'all god's surface
his ocean .
his swamps .
his slopes and ridges
to find myself .
at last .
a mark in the aching snow .
from whence i beheld through a blue haze a world of mountains piled upon mountains .
ada !
ada !
it's a man !
what is?
raidin 'our corncrib !
got him in the trap !
that's him yelpin '!
help !
here .
help !
damn .
listen up !
you got ...
aim !
you got a barrel trained on your rear end !
get me outta this dang thing !
you got a weapon?
no , ma'am .
i'm ...
my fists are about to drop off .
unbelievable .
stobrod thewes !
ruby?
that's my daddy .
just so's you know , i can eat while she's doin 'this .
just so's you know , you ain't eatin 'inside .
number one , they hang people round here for takin 'in deserters .
number two , even if they was givin 'out prizes , you'd still eat outside .
you're scarred .
i'm what?
your heart .
scarred .
i did wrong to ya .
you'd be scarred .
you'd be real scarred if i hadn't wrapped them trap teeth in sackin '.
which was my idea .
which was her idea .
i hurt you .
good god .
i made up 50 tunes with you in mind .
ruby this , ruby that , ruby with the eyes that sparkle .
hey !
let's agree .
you beat me , you abandoned me , you ignored me , then you beat me some more .
and all of that is better'n " ruby with the eyes that sparkle .
i'm changed .
people change .
war changes people somethin 'terrible .
ruby's told you , i've no doubt , i wasn't always the best .
you were an asshole !
i can't disagree with that .
i was .
would you get him outta here?
music's changed me .
i'm full of music , ruby .
i wish i'd brung my fiddle .
hey , ruby , i got a new fiddle .
oh , it's a beautiful fiddle .
it's full of tunes , ruby .
i didn't know i had it in me .
you're all set .
i ...
bless you both .
all right , then .
ain't you got a proper coat?
aw , darlin ', i'm fine , you know .
and you just say the word , i won't come back neither .
don't wanna put you or your mistress here in any bother .
i'm not ruby's employer .
oh .
beg pardon .
nobody is .
oh .
you know who really needs a coat , darlin '?
my partner .
fat boy name of pangle .
we're hidin 'up in a cave with a singer from georgia , and pangle , he feels the cold like a thin man , but there ain't no coat'll fit him .
i love you , ruby .
in case the sky falls on our head .
you always were a good girl .
ooh !
he's so full of manure , that man .
we could lay him in the dirt and ... grow another one just like him .
that's medicine , that's goat meat .
and you're sick of both .
i have a deal to thank you for .
that's just for show .
# ruby with the eyes that sparkle
get on back where you came from !
thank you for my coat !
thanks for the food !
git ! # ruby with the eyes that sparkle !
i love my coat !
my love for linton is like the foliage in the woods .
time will change it .
i'm well aware .
as winter changes the trees .
my love for heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath .
a source of little visible delight ,
but necessary .
he's always ... always in my mind .
she ain't gonna marry linton , is she?
you can't say that about heathcliff and then marry linton .
hmm .
we'll find out .
tomorrow .
i'm not waitin 'till tomorrow !
ruby ...
a source of ... little visible delight , but ... necessary .
i like that .
i'm a confederate soldier ... on furlough .
i need shelter ... and food .
i've got a rifle !
fair enough .
i have some beans and corn pone .
all i got .
thank you .
i'm alone here , as you can see , with my baby .
i need to believe you mean no harm .
no .
i don't want it .
if i had my way , they'd take metal altogether out of this world .
every blade , every gun .
it's all right .
you're burnin 'up , little man .
is your baby sick?
my man's dead .
took his wound at gettysburg and never saw his boy .
i'm sorry .
it's pretty much what you'll get if you knock on any door of this war .
man dead , woman left .
it's mean food , but it's hot .
there's been no huntin 'on the road , just cress and roots .
i need to try and feed this man .
you gotta eat somethin ', baby .
he won't feed .
i'm inman , by the way .
that's my name .
i'm sara .
my baby's ethan .
glad to know you both .
you look about his size .
he was another man straight up and down .
thank you .
everything fit?
these boots are good boots .
well , i'll say good night , then .
good night .

fellas , what's the rush?
if ruby finds out we've spent the night , there'll be hell to pay .
my love .
where are you?
with no hope of reaching you .
i write to you .
as i always do .
as i have always done .
# i'm alone .
but i don't worry
# 'cause i'm sittin 'on top of the world
you reckon we could eat this?
hey .

it's froze .
how long it been there for?

yeah .
not very long .
good evenin '.
hope we didn't disturb you .
d'you mind if i warm myself by your fire?
name's teague .
do i know you?
stobrod thewes .
that your wife?
that's a " he .
is " he " your wife?
we're musicians .
he picks a banjo , i got a fiddle .
your sweetheart's got a nice piece of flesh on him .
he looks pretty romantic by the fire .
it's a picture of love .
you gonna play that fiddle?
sure .
sure .
hey , wake up .
evenin ', missis .
where's georgia?
" where's georgia "?
captain teague wants us to play now .
love to .
we heard there were some deserters up in these parts hidden out in a big cave .
not come to my ears .
so you don't know where this big cave is?
no , sir .
you do , stobs .
he means ...
no , right .
no , no .
there is a cave right up near bearpen branch .
we played some music up there .
never occurred to me they were outliers .
it ain't nowhere near bearpen branch .
he's always gettin 'lost .
that cave we live there .
i used to freeze up in that cave till i got gived this new coat .
ruby made me this coat .
i like my coat .
this part belonged to a reverend and this part belonged to a horse .
ruby said what is it? i should pray or neigh , dependin '.
he don't ... he don't know what he's sayin '.
he got a mind no bigger than a pickled walnut .
it's a good coat .
# i wish .
i wish my baby was born
# and sittin 'on its papa's knee
# and me .
poor girl
# and me .
poor girl .
were dead and gone
# and the green grass growin 'o'er my feet
# i ain't ahead .
nor never will be
# till the sweet apple grows on a sour apple tree
# the owl .
the owl
# is a lonely bird
# it chills my heart
# with dread and terror
# that someone's blood
# someone's blood
# there on his wing
# that someone's blood
# there on his ... feather
broke my young heart .
we gonna be here all night?
stand over there .
ruby , she don't know one end of the war from the other .
you don't have to worry yourself about her , is what i'm sayin '.
or ada , neither .
you know what i'm sayin '?
you too .
you stand over there .
we gonna get our tintype made?
don't smile .
what?
quit smilin '.
he always smiles .
he don't mean nothin 'by it .
i told him , there ain't nothin 'in this world worth a smile !
put your hat over your face .
cover your face with your hat .
ruby !
what?
ruby !
what's wrong?
teague ...
the home guard ...
what?
they shot your daddy !
they shot your daddy , and pangle too !
i told georgia he can stop here .
i told him he can sleep in the barn .
he's got nothin 'inside him .
he'll walk out of here and die in the snow .
he can milk the cows .
i was worried about that .
it's five hours 'climb from here .
he drew a map .
i'm ready .
you know them fools stayed the night in the mill?
that's stobrod thewes .
can't do one good thing without addin 'the bad .
left tracks in the snow all the way up for the home guard to follow .
sign that says " shoot me .
ruby ...
ruby .
i'm sorry .
every piece of this is man's bullshit .
they call this war a cloud over the land , but they made the weather , and then they stand in the rain and say " shit , it's rainin '!
if i cry one tear for my daddy , i stole it off a crocodile .
all right , then .
all right , then .
dear god .
oh , dear god .
he ain't here .
teague's probably took him .
they did that with the swanger boys , didn't they?
strung 'em up , as a warnin '.
they took his coat .
why would they take his coat?
daddy?
daddy !
daddy !
daddy?
he's still breathin '!
it's ruby !
don't you die on me again !
we gotta get him home .
he won't make it .
he'll die first .
he's got hardly no blood left in him .
there it is .
i feel it .
you got it?
yep .
there's a place close .
old cherokee .
it used to be .
it's got shelter .
water .
i used to hide up there when he'd get a temper goin '.
god !
i'll go look for some food .
take the shotgun .
goddamn .
turn around !
go back where you came from !
go back !
ada?
ada monroe?
turn around or i'll shoot !
inman?
inman?
inman .
you better come with me .
ruby .
this is inman .
oh !
congratulations !
oughta send you out with a shotgun a lot more !
looks if he's about to topple over .
i may need to .
you shot or somethin '?
not lately .
he's asleep .
i ain't surprised .
your man looked tuckered out .
i saw him .
in sally swanger's well .
a man like a black smudge in the snow .
well , there you go .
it wasn't the same , what i saw .
in the well it was as if he were falling .
you probably just don't remember it right .
i remember it exactly .
there were crows black crows .
they were flyin 'towards me .
ruby , i thought i was seein 'him fall .
instead , i was seein 'him come back to me .
i got big plans for that farm .
i know .
i know you have .
i got a vision in my mind of how black cove oughta be .
i don't know , ruby .
all this while i've been packin 'ice around my heart .
how do i make it melt?
hey !
you about done with my knife?
we got a bird to cook .
just about .
you're makin 'a pig's ear of that job .
give it to me .
oh , i ain't gonna cut you .
can't see that it'd make a bit of difference if i did .
you got the right feelings for her?
don't turn your head !
i do .
i'm sorry .
i was tryin 'to be quiet .
did you get my letters?
i got three letters .
i carried them .
i carried them in the book you gave me .
the bartram .
i probably sent 103 .
did you write to me?
whenever i could .
if you never got them , i can summarize .
no .
no , no .
" i pray you are well .
i pray i am in your thoughts .
you are all that keeps me from slidin 'into some dark place .
how did i keep you?
we barely knew each other .
it was a few moments .
a thousand moments .
they're like a bag ... of tiny diamonds .
don't matter if they're real or things i made up .
the shape of your neck .
that's real .
the way you felt under my hands when i pulled you to me .
you were plowing a field .
you were carrying a tray .
you wouldn't come in .
no , i wouldn't go in .
so that's why i had to carry a tray .
so i could come out to see you .
that kiss .
which i kissed every day of my walking .
every day i was waiting .
longing .
longing to see your face .
if you could see my inside ...
now , whatever you wanna name it my spirit?
that's what i fear .
i think i'm ruined .
they kept tryin 'to put me in the ground .
but i wasn't ready .
inman ...
but if i had ... if i had goodness , i lost it .
if i had anything tender in me , i shot it dead .
how could i write to you after what i done , what i seen?
number one , shut this door .
it's freezin '.
number two , shut that door .
it's freezin '.
layin 'on my back , my fingers poked in my ears , tryin 'to shut out who's got a bag of diamonds , who's carrying a tray ...
if you wanna get three feet up a bull's ass , just listen to what sweethearts whisper to one another .
in fact , if y'all gonna wimble wimble all night , i'm gonna sleep in with him .
i'll say good night .
no .
please ... don't say good night .
wars make some things pointless .
it's hard to imagine a wedding .
i think even my father would recognize that .
ada , i wanna marry you .
if you'll have me .
isn't there some religion where you just have to say " i marry you " three times , and you're man and wife?
i marry you .
i marry you .
i marry you .
why is that funny?
i think it's " i divorce you " three times and you're not married anymore .
i can wait for you .
oh , inman .
i marry you .
i marry you .
i marry you .
i marry you .
i marry you .
i have so ...
i have so many buttons .
sorry .
will you turn your back?
no .
no , i will not .
i'll lead the horse at a pace your daddy can tolerate .
you two go ahead now .
no , i don't wanna do that .
no .
we can all go together .
it's safer this way .
we're deserters .
no one has a quarrel with you .
he's right .
i gather i ...
i need permission from you , ruby , if i reckon on livin 'at black cove .
all right , then .
you stay on that horse .
and don't lose it .
or sell it .
gonna need it back on the farm .
all right , daddy .
i don't wanna let you go .
i'll be with you by nightfall .
ugh .
all right , then .
hope that georgia boy's been tendin 'to the animals .
i knew you were thinkin 'on him .
i was not !
i was thinkin 'on swollen udders .
oh !
and before you say " same difference " ...
i'm sayin 'nothin '!
miss lovey dovey !
miss lovey dovey !
hey !
that was a long funeral for your daddy .
that was a wake .
that was irish .
now , your friend georgia here ...
we went down to visit you when we heard you were harborin 'deserters , and he told us after some persuasion you were up here .
we were up and down this mountain .
up and down .
there will be a reckoning .
when this war is over , there will be a reckoning .
did you make this coat?
helpin 'a deserter that's treason .
now , i know it's half horse and half reverend .
a reckonin '?
the reckoning's for your world .
it's not mine .
i'i be damned .
he's a hard bastard to kill .
no !
ruby !
inman !
captain teague !
come down from there !
no , sir .
here is fine .
i'll just shoot the horse out from under you .
you ridin 'captain teague's animal?
i am .
he dead?
i hope so .
look , give me your gun and ride on home .
i'm done fightin '.
i'm sick of it !
i give you my gun , you're gonna shoot me dead .
i will not shoot you , but nor am i goin 'down this mountain lookin 'over my shoulder for you .
that's what they call a conundrum .
i'll tell you what i got on my side .
what you got on your side?
the confidence of youth .
inman !
no !
i ... came ... back .
i love you .
baby .
what we have lost will never be returned to us .
the land will not heal .
too much blood .
the heart will not heal .
all we can do is make peace with the past and try to learn from it .
what are you doing?
he died in the night , love .
bring him here .
don't kill him .
i'm not gonna kill him .
we have to try somethin 'or else he's gonna die too .
it's all right .
we're gonna try a little trick .
there are days now when i manage not to think of you .
when the needs of the farm call with more urgency than my heart .
this time of year there's so much life everywhere .
i find you in all of it .
as if you were still walking home to me .
if you could see us now this easter day at black cove .
you would know every step of your journey was worth it .
# i'm still climbing upwards
# and my journey's almost ended
# so .
friend .
if you're thirsty
# climb this mountain with me
grace inman , nobody said " eat .
for good friends , good food , good family , all our blessings , o lord , we thank thee .
amen .
amen .
amen .
amen .
amen !
sweetheart , there's no cider .
that's for you .
right .
i'd best ...
i'd best fetch it .
i got my orders .
i looked once more down sally's well .
and this time there was nothin 'there to haunt me .
just clouds .
clouds .
and then ... sun .
# well i recall his parting words
# must i accept his fate
# or take myself far from this place?
# i thought i heard a black bell toll
# a little bird did sing
# man has no choice
# when he wants every thing
# we'll rise above the scarlet tide
# that trickles down through the mountain
# and separates the widow from the bride
# man goes beyond his own decision
# gets caught up in the mechanism
# of swindlers who act like kings
# and brokers who break everything
# the dark of night was swiftly fading
# close to the dawn of day
# why would i want him just to lose him again?
# we'll rise above the scarlet tide
# that trickles down through the mountain
# and separates the widow from the bride
# you'll walk unscathed through musket fire
# no plowman's blade will cut thee down
# no cutler's horn will mark thy face
# and you will be my ain true love
# and you will be my ain true love
# and as you walk through death's dark veil
# the cannon's thunder can't prevail
# and those who hunt thee down will fail
# and you will be my ain true love
# and you will be my ain true love
# asleep inside the cannon's mouth
# the captain cries " here comes the rout
# they'll seek to find me north and south
# i've gone to find my ain true love
# the field is cut and bleeds to red
# the cannonballs fly round my head
# the infirmary man may count me dead
# when i've gone to find my ain true love
# i've gone to find my ain true love
