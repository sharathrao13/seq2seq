announcingthe unprecedented opening of the fbi legal attache office in moscow along with the first ever joint us and russian cooperation .

my poor brother ...
how many militia did you kill?
terek please, we didn't have a chance .
there were 30 of them .
plus the american .
yes , yes .

not even one?
terek please .
i did what i could ...
you did what you could !
you let those militia pigs and that american scum kill my brother .
without killing one in return?
o. k .
that's what you could do .
here is what i can do !
i loved this man like a brother .
he was a dear friend and partner to me .
so i took no joy in that .
but just think ... if i could do this to one i love ... what could i do to someone i hate?
so ... the american fbl ... declare war with us .
and war it is .
unlike other ...
the hiena takes no chances .
never atacking under sure of a kill .
though a consument killer , he is clearly no gentelman .
i apologise for keeping you waiting .
i had some other buisiness to dispose off .
so much wasted time , confusing motion with acomplishment .
another drink?
the mvd killed my brother .
for that , i will see them drown in blood .
but their allies in america ...
i wish to send them a message , and very bad public .
i want to strike fear into the marrow of their bones .
can you kill this person?
yes .
if i take this job i have to dissapear .
forever .

how much?

how many people know about this?
you and i.

o. k .
informants tell us terek has put bounties on all mvd and fbi personel .
deputy director preston and ihave special bounties on our lives .
in two weeks seven mvd operatives have been killed .
at least we know we are getting into .
informants say it is just a start .
terek has planned something more dramatic .

their only contact with the outside is this man ,
victor politovsky .
goes to the porvoo post office twice a day for terek's mail which arrives general delivery .
contact interpol and get everything you can on politovsky .
yes sir .
terek's men are notoriously hard to turn out .
should we get the opportunity , we must be prepared to conduct the interrogation with the at most efficiency .
good day to you , mr preston .

what are they planning for?
who are you?

jesus ...
drug assistance interrogation is perfectly legal , when the matter is a state security .
unfortunately mr politovsky had an undiagnozed heart condition .
he said ...
jackal?
does this mean something to you , mr preston?
he is supposedly a killer for hire , who uses that name .
several assasinations was acredited to him , but we have never been able to prove if he even exists .
from time to time he was kgb assert .
do you have a name?
no name .
payments were made to the contracting organizations or a hong kong bank account . no kgb member has ever seen him .
do we know , if he ever operated in the us?
no .
but ...
politovsky's briefcase contained bigraphical material ... on your donald brown , director of the fbl .

these guys are going for the gold .
get her on the phone for me .
good morning .

man , i give you a really good deal on this minivan , you know ...
it's brand new , it's fully loaded .
we have got 60 cd changer for you .

i think everything should be okay mr murdock .
oh .
make it charlie , allright?
allright charlie , see you in a second .
take your time .
i want this ... close hold .
no publicity .
for the working group together , staat , cla , secret service ,
russian emabassy .
i'll have daily progress reports 9 p . m . at this office .
major koslova , anything else?
since 1983 ...
kgb provided founding for fight direct action missions .
one bombing and 4 assasinations ...
the jackal was the operative used .
not giving me much to work with , preston .
we don't have much , sir .
major koslova's informers can't finger .
they don't know who he is .
the cla can't track him .
then what?
using kgb files i've identified 6 operatives we belive , they have actually seen him .
4 are dead , one is in lybia , but the last one is belived to be here in the united states .
a bask separatist named lsabella celia zancona .
she maight at least know how he looks like .
but we have no idea about where she is .
now , someone must tell ...
interpol says ... in the 80's she was involved with one ... declan joseph mulqueen ,
ira sharpshooter . so they decided to get him out of irland and shipped him over here .
in 1989 he picked up twice 25 years for weapon ...
he is curently serving time in a maximum security state camp in massachusetts .
i say he does know where she is .
what makes you think he'll talk to you?
i'm hoping he will cooperate for a reduced sentence .
but don't promise too much .
after all ... he's a terrorist .
you have got some visitors , mulqueen .
what do you want from lsabella?
she has done nothing here .
she entered the country illegaly .
what?
the fbi sent deputy directors out after illegal aliens?
give over , preston , what you're really looking for?
a pro .
calls himself " the jackal " .
the " mystery man " .
we think she maight have seen him , and may be able to help us find him .
if so , we will arrange a pardon for her signed by the president of the united states .
and garantee no extradition , and also garantee , the spanish government will never know about her .
they don't know now , do they?
neither do you .
let's keep it that way .
would it matter that you maight be saving a human life?
human life , whatever , say again ... would it be important enough for all of this?
mr donald brown , director of the fbl .
it can not be truth .
look , we know that certain elements in this prison want you dead .
the entire government wants me dead , mister .
yet , here i am .
oh you smart ass , let's cut the bullshit .
you cooperate , and you'll be to transfer to a minimum security facility .
that's our deal .
and that's your chance to walk out this god damn place in one piece .
that's a one time offer .
take it or leave it .
stuff a time , waste of fucken time ...
pardon my language , i've been in prison ...
alright , what would it take for you to help us?
first i'd have to be convinced that isabella would be kept safe .
done .
then you would have to let me go , back to ireland .
free man .
out of the question .
besides gunnery , you are a known killer by the british government ...
not to mention all the women and children you've probably blew out .
it's not my war ! .
i was never a bomber .
i don't see the distinction !
you steal human lives .
a distinction is a killer at war .
i wanna go home .
as simple as that .
simple for you , perhaps .
same as in russia , soldiers go home when the truce is signed yet?
well , that's not gonna happen .
sorry
alright , just the chance .
your best effort is to give me freedom .
i'll sell her for your word on it .
i'm sorry .
so the jackal is after your director , is he?
just tell him to get his affairs in order ,
nobody can save him now .
nobody , except me !
because i've met him !
oh yeah , didn't i mentioned that?
i can identify him , by his face .
give me the opportunity .
but more importantly .. by his methods .
so you can leave isabella out of this .
did you work with him?
with him?
no .
no way .
did you have a problem with this man?
that's between him and me .
isabella zancona is the only confirmed contact we have .
and we will find her .
with or without your help .
o. k . , o . k .
i want 3 things .
one : get me out of here .
no use to here
what will keep you from trying to escape?
nothing .
simply , i give you my word .
i go with you to meet lsabella .
why?
to see her .
that's all .
and the third thing?
decent razor .
you will be searched ... and if we find as much as a paperclip , that hasn't been authorized
i send you right back to prison .
the same goes for using the telephone . you don't trust me?
as far as i can throw you ...
but i have a little choice .
and if you have got any thoughts about the ira snatch we will shoot to kill ... them and you .
and not necesserily on their arm
understand?
i heard you .
go along and we will get along .
i will keep a real good eye on you .
miss koslova , is it?
and what your first name be , then?
major .
major koslova .
we're a bit rusty , that's all .
sub assembly of titanium , so light as stresses will allow .
the arms are gonna traverse 270 degrees . ... drive mechanism with two time servos .
all things are gonna run at 12 volt dc .
okay .
well , it's car batteries , that's cool .
how much weight is the arm gonna support?
55 kilograms .
hehe ... bigfucker , yea?
hey , you want one?
no .
you know , i want this in 8 days .
i can do that .
o. k .
how much?
well , titanium is gonna be a problem .
it's a listed material , so it's gonna take time and a little more money .
50 grand?
i mean ... well ... 40 ... 40 grand .
alright .
half now , half on delivery .
this suckers definietly are gonna kick some ass , yea? .
when you finish this unit , your gonna turn over the plans and all the scrap material
you're gonna forget about charlie murdock and his plans
yea , sure man , i'm cool .
relax .
alright .
are you nervous?
8 years .
it's a life time , isn't it?
hello !
mr decker , is it?
hello there , i'm declan mulqueen .
and this is major koslova .
how do you do?
we would like to speak to your wife .
iss .
someone to see you !
i'll take the kids out there .
my beautiful irish .
they have let me out to ask you something .
sir , i was thinking , maybe we could use the woman as insurance ....
isabella zanconas environment remains classified
that means : nothing in the report .
no name , no location .
nothing .
got it?
yes sir .
i've never known his name , but was definietly an american
he had some kind of a ... special military training and he learnt spanish in ei salvador , i think ...
i didn't like talking to him
i suppose , we were all dangerous people , but he was ... different .
i mean , declan was fire , all passionate ...
but this man was ice . no feelings , nothing .
o. k .
thank you mrs decker .
you've been very helpfull .
incidentaly , it would be best if you'd keep our conversation confidential even for your husband .
don't worry about george . he doesn't know anything about my pass , and he doesn't want to .
all he needs to know is ... that i love him .
i see .
well , i thank you again .
i'll wait for you in the car .
this opens a lock at norfolk bus station
inside is a clean passport and 10000 dollars cash .
your friends left it with me in case you have shown up
take it , and go back to ireland .
i can not .
you gave your word?
go now !
you know , after he kills whoever he's after they'll send you back to prison .
when i believed that , i'd use the key .
are you happy at least?
yes .
i love my children ... and my husband .
in my way , i mean ..
still at night i can close my eyes ... and sleep ... and no dead faces come to wake me .
that is more than i ever had ..
you wouldn't have me give that up , would you?
give me some credit babe ...
she is bask , isn't she?
they say , bask live by the vendetta .
if they hate someone , it's to the death .
it's the same way , when they love ...
my first name is valentina .
do you have family in russia?
my parents .
my brother in the navy .
husband?
kids?
no .
i have not found the time .
in truth ... it's never been a conflict for me .
this is not a quality a man looks for in the woman .
by the way ,
whatever lsabella gave you , after i left
i trust you won't use that after our buissiness is concluded .
you don't miss a thing , do you?
no , mr mulqueen ,
i see everything .
maybe we should start by canceling you public appearances?
no , no .
i don't thing that's necessary .
i mean not yet .
those fellows are gonna do same preparations and they need time .
mr mulqueen , something you'd like to share with us?
he's likely to be using full of false identities
three would be on him , and one reserve in a dropbag somewhere
this is how he used to operate .
what matter if he has 40?
it's still one man !
we maight be creating a storm in a tea cup .
yea , yea ... exactly ...
direktor bolitonov ,
terek has always made doing his own killing a point of honour ... usually very bloody and very public .
a " statement " , if you wish .
so , if he's hiding outside there obviously this is something he takes very seriously .
untill this jackal is captured or killed ,
i don't think we can afford to do the less .
ah come on , let's get real ...
hey , i mean it's one guy .
it's just one guy .
bolitonov's right !
but with the assets in this room , the guy is good as god .
as if he does stick his dick in a ring ...
like a lot of this clowns ...
what's that mr mulqueen?
sorry , mr brown . this man is not a clown .
he knows all your moves back to front .
you have a name .
that's all you're at !
so the jackal has got a target .
you !
he's got the timetable .
and as to making mistakes , he spent 20 years in a trade that doesn't forgive error !
do you think he's vulnerable up against us?
set the way round .
hi .
can i buy you a drink?
yea .
maybe you should come home with me?
i'd love to .
but i can't .
i have to go back to atlanta ...
does she know?
she does now .
so , how am i gonna see you again?
you can give me one of your cards .
you're not gonna call .
you just have to have a little faith in people , thats all .
like i do .
open your shirt .
easy ...
now !
easy ...
open your shirt ...
souvenires ...
british hospitality .
i apologize
no problem .
oslo travel came up with james william hayslip , he flew from toronto on august 25th .
two days before meeting with terek .
we checked the social security number on his passport , and guess what .
they belonged to an inmate commited to a mental institution in virginia twelve years ago .
now , canadian travels says he flew to montreal .
nine days ago .
charlie murdock .
i think i have a delivery yet .
yes , yes .
hi !
i need to use one of your computers .
sure .
anyone .
can i get online with this?
yeah , sure .
thank you .
hayslip has dissapeared .
a border patrol has his passport photo , but nothing has shown up yet .
he's moved on .
i told you .
one moment .
only place for sure he has been is montreal .
what if he started the next identity there?
i'm not following you .
hayslip's dissapeared , but that doesn't mean the jackal though .
perhaps something has happened .
witherspoon ,
have the montreal police goes through their logs for the last 48 hours .
if he signed to the next name , because it's in the plan?
man like this doesn't make mistakes .
no .
they always make one .
somewhere .
isn't that how you were caught?
what's our story ...?
major koslova ... ends the debate about women in combat .
as far as i'm concerned .
how is that?
when she saved my life and took out terek's brother .
she did it knowing she would be drawing a death sentence down there ...
but when we offered settle her up at some place elswhere , when this is over ...
you know what she said?
the good guys don't hide .
fearless woman .
in that country ... under that system ... staggering .
oh shit , you know what?
i couldn't get titanium , so i had a friend of mine mould the base at carbon fibres instead .
it came at 23 kilos down of the weight you wanted .
is that cool?
yes , it's great .
but i still want the planes , the mould and the scratch material .
yeah ... maybe we ... are to talk about that once more .
you see , this rig ...
i figure it's to support something really heavy .
like a ... gatling gun maybe?
or a ... 20 millimetre cannon?
so , you gotta be sure that it's really something big , right?
armoured car , maybe?
i don't know !
you know , you gotta be sure the fucken ...
but a .... the point is ... a job like this can atract a lot of attention .
i don't want an attention ...
right , right ... and that's what i'm saying ,
i think the plans and the mould were a little bonus .
how much?
i don't know ...
100 grand?
come on man , you know it's worth it .
you've got a serious piece of equipement there .
alright .
i'll give you 50 grand tomorrow .
i need a place to test it , though .
some place that won't draw any attention .
we have place like that , we have place just like that .
target's at place .
you know , i should have brought some beer .
motherfucker ...
that motherfucker is a state of the art !
i knew it's gonna be big , but i didn't know it's gonna be the fucken prototype cannon !
it's a fucken monstrum !
man , look at the rounds .
made from the uranium .
once they get inside , they just spatter .
yeah?
they get in there and ...
that rocks !
look at the phreacking lens on that thing .
don't touch that !
they're like 2 . 000 mile zoom lense .
is this thing a prototype , or what?
i bet it has cost you a shit load !
that rocks !
you know , what i'm saying?
it kicks ass .
i can't wait to see ...
lamont !
close your mouth .
o. k .?
well , at least ... you took out the target .
no , it's off .
by at least 3 millimeters .
no , that's precision craftsmanship .
so lamont , tell me how to set this thing automatically .
you just ... touch a wind correction and elevation , and hit enter .
so you just a ... estimate it , huh?
and hit enter?
i give up !
i guess the automatic siding works . is about to sprawl ...
well lamont ,
let's speed test it now .
speed test .
so ... run !
what do you mean?
i mean run .
now !
run to your right !
get up !
just stop there !
get up !
hold that pack of cigarettes .
don't be afraid !
stand very still !
stand still !
i told you , that was off .
move over by the car !
quick !
here it goes sir ..
eleven days ago charles c. murdock ... bought himself a brand new dodge minivan .
now !
that was a big surprise for mr. murdock , whose passport and wallet were stolen 16 days ago at the helsinki airport .
anything from the border?
we have sent the description of the van to every crossing ...
i have something .
uphall station .
it is a small town outside ottawa .
i think your man has been there .
let's go .
the owner is lan lamont ...
hello !
i think i got something here .
what is it?
this is a remote firing station .
it manoeuvres a weapon , the servo is on of a ... remote control .
like a ... like a model aeroplane .
we used that things for models or a ...
but nothing like ... this size !
he needs a van , just to move around .
what would something of this size be used for?
antiaircraft?
no !
you can buy them ...
missiles are best for the aircraft .
this was something else ...
something with one hell of a range !
not just a range , though .
see , this is a gun , it's a cyclic rate .
it sends out a hundred bullets , before the first one reaches the target .
the thing about boats like this , is it sells itself .
it has a lot for the money .
it's got radar , gps , autopilot , autotackle ...
this has even a cellular phone .
you can call your wife if you want to ...
so , what you think?
deja vu .
she is perfect .
jackal .
they know you were in canada , and have an irish who is helping them .
the irishman's name?
mulqueen .
declan mulqueen?
declan mulqueen .
the operation still at go .
declan .
the crossing points and airports have his photograph but r. m. c. p. has nothing .
on our side the boarder patrol and i. n. s. are both in a highest alert .
again .
nothing .
but let's face it .
don't be houdini to make a cross from canada .
probably walking cross for christ sake .
he won't be walking , i can tell you that .
he's got a weapon to move .
what kind of patrol do you have on this? the great lakes?
not a lot .
no need .
people either fly or drive .
there are a few ferry services , but we checked those , as well
what about people with boats?
what kind of emigration controls they have?
arriving vessels have to check at the harbour .
hmm ... voluntarily?
yeah .
no active enforcement .
say he does use a boat he still wanna .. mix with others .
are there any gatherings to speak of?
yeah , the mackinaw regatta is going on .
it's the biggest regatta on lake michigan .
from where to were?
it starts in mackinaw and it ends in chicago .
witherspoon , take waveland .
declan , valentina , chicago yachtklub .
i'll take the locals .
and remember , he would be on ontario registered boat .
so look at everything and stay on your radios .
if you do find something , call in back .
i want an arrest , not a firefight .
alright , lets get to it .
preston, what about let me have a gun?
are you crazy?
a fucking gun ...
so many people .
so many rich people .

hi , want some chmpagne?
come on , join us .
maybe later ...
get out of the way !
preston , cani talk to you?
look , he saw me .
he wasn't surprised !
like he was expecting me !
one of your team is playing for the other side !
impossible !
i can trust every man on tis team .
i'm telling you ...
this is not the ira , we don't get into ...
somebody got to ...
look .
this is a manhunt , not your cause .
don't make it personal .
what do you fucken know ...
i'll tell you , what i know ...
i know the jackal set you up in an arms deal in lybia .
i know isabella was wounded , when you walked into the trap .
i also know , it was the buissiness ...
do you also know , that isabella was pregnant?
that our child didn't survived !
don't tell me it's not personal !
i can't let you jeopardize us !
in a vendetta .
there's no vendetta .
i hope for a fresh start , you know ...
maybe it will happen ...

i began this .
