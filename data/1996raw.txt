i ...
i'm begining to think that maybe
i should consider taking that city bank job

hmmm ...
don't even think about taking a job that doesn't make your heart sing .
tell her like it is mangus .
being angelica's nunny .

charlene has only ever been interested in low budget b slasher movies .

you're right , you're right of course she's coming to dinner .

hey you guys
we brought you a present from colorado
cows balls?
from her new album on martha records , that was amy cook singing 'million holes in heaven '.
and i am alice pieszecki , and you're listening to the chart on kcrw welcome back ...
today on the chart we're looking at ... how do you end a vicious psycho .
ooh , and for those of you out there in radioland who are sick of hearing me rant about my ex , dana , you'll be happy to know this is not about her .
this continuum of connectedness is about the cause and effect ... of one psychotropic drug after another to the point where you're medicating your medication .
why don't we start with ... the very first anti depressive i tried .
it made me just a little intense .
so , then i said to my doctor ... can you just give me somethingh strong , really strong , that will just make me happy , is that too much to ask?
so he gave me lithium .
so that one really just made me haculinate that i was happy .
did you change your hair?
then , the ... a ... the withdrawal from those two drugs gave her a. d. d.
so , i got the a. d. d. drug .
you know the one .
i snort mine ...
do you snort yours?
gurber munster wrote me prescription for the new ssri which he highly recommends , but said under rare cases may cause me to commit suicide .
so i was a little scared to take those ...
which meant i wasn't on anything ...
which meant i actually felt like having sex again .
which ...
really made me want to kill myself .
how long ago did you first notice it?
umm ... just few weeks ago .
ok
actually i probably noticed it before that but i kinda ran away ...
so
i do have a rash ... if you could look ... take a look at it .
ah i bet that's from your sport's bra yeah ...
then i could give you a little hydric cortizone cream to help sews it .
but is there any history of breasts cancer in your family?
not that i know of .
you really should find out dana , are your parents still alive?
yes , still alive , still together .
great so ask your mum for a history of your family .
ok? 'cause it's just ... you know good thinghs to know .
so , have there been any changes in the color or texture of your breasts?
no
and any discharge from the nipple?
um no
ok up you get
usually these little cysts are benin , a lot of women just have lumpy breasts .
i do , i have fibrous breasts .
it's pretty gross .
it's perfectly normal ... and i'm just checking your lymph nodes here .
especially in women your age ,
it's not like there is anythingh to be too concerned about .
let's check the other side for you .
ok
the lymph nodes are a little swollen but that could be from anything , the cold , even brushing your teeth too hard .
i'm a super hard theeth brusher .
well you're too young dana to start getting mammograms on a regular bases .
but i'd like to do one , just to make sure everything is allright .
so , i am going to send you down to radiation .
and you just take that with you .
fuck ...
fuck .
oh , hi ruth , how are ya?
27 , alice .
27 ... 27 , what do you mean?
that the number of times , that you mentioned dana ... in this broadcast , which is down from 43 in the previous show .
see , what i tell you , i'm practically over her .
i could fired you right now .
you could?
but i am not going to .
i am gonna give you one more chance .
but , i need to know in advance what your topics are gonna be .
and i'd like to see your script .
yes , i'd like to see your script , i need to see your script , and which the letters d. a followed by n. a are nowhere in evidence .
how about that?
o k
ok
you look good ...
in that orange .
ok come closer .
come on , take your breast , come on .
like this?
place it on the lower plate .
that's good .
like this .
allright
and then i'm gonna lower the upper plate
ok
now maybe ... a little unconfortable ... but it'll only last for a few seconds .
it's allright , i'm a hard ass ... a hard boob .
hold your breast ok
this is kcrw santa monica at 89 . 9 , music and mpr news , morning , noon and night .
don't forget to listen to chart with alice pieszecki thursday afternoon at 3 o'clock .
daaannnnnnaaaa .
excuse me .
excuse me sorry , would you mind turning it off?
thanks
god ... that show is so funny .
alice pieszecki , the host is completely falling appart because her girlfriend left her .
the girlfriend just seems like this complete nitwit ... and you don't know why alice is so obsessed with her in a first place .
do you have any idea why this is taking so long?
dana farebanks .
the doctor wilson is waiting for you in her office .
you can go back upstairs .
ok thanks .
byred it sounds like a personnal add from my ex girlfriend .
right , well a byred 4 is a diagnostic assessment . no this suspicious mass dana could be absolutly nothing .
it could be what we call a fibro adenoma . farbbb .... blaaaa head muma , what?
i got soya bean pods in my boobs?
it's a benin solid lump .
but with the byred 4 we're going to do a biospy .
now i can get you in for that tomorrow with doctor shapeero .
i'm suppose to go out to dinner tonight .
you go out ahead , i mean ...
just do exactly as you were planning to do because this is not a diagnosis ... and with biopsys in pre menoposal women , they're mostly benin .
so it's ...
it's probably nothing ... right
but ... we gonna find out for sure .
but try not to think about it tonight allright?
yeah sure i can do that ...
yeah .
is she asleep?
uh? ...
um ... in her bed .
how was your lunch with helena?
it's fine .
are you hidding a book in that magazine?
it's .... um ...
mark epstein talked about it in his lecture last week ...
it's
she a buddhist philosopher , pema chodron .
how cute ... she looks like a wookie .
actually there are a lot in there that ... reminded me of you ...
'we work on ourselves in order to help others but we also help others in order to work on ourselves . '
i don't know about that ...
i mean , the people i work with , they're truly selfless .
oh no no .
i don't think she meant it the way that you're taking it .
that's ... um ...
oh actually , there is another passage that ... that reminded me of me ...
i ...
'feeling irritated , restless , affraid , and hopeless , is a reminder to listen more carefully . '
i'm gonna go feed her , if we're gonna go to this jenny dinner .
um ...
would you call angus ...
and ...
make sure he's on his way?
helena peabody offered me a job .
so are you considering it?
i don't know yet ...
somebody in this family's gotta make a living .
i have made a living for the last 15 years ,
i don't think my ability to make a living is really in question .
i'm not questionning your ability , i'm questionning your desire .
i thought you hated the movie business?
there is a lot i hate about the movie business ...
i definitely haven't said yes ... but she made it very attractive .
so then there's ... no reasons that i ... should feel ... threatenend or ...
no ... there's nothing between us anymore , nothing at all .
well ... did you talk about money?
i don't know yet .
i don't ...
i ...

my band and i are put out our second record right now .

you could totally do it kit i mean ... all your poll and all the people you can get to play with ya .
well ...
i ...
i've got songs ...
i ...
kinda *** songs i would love to record .
but i would have to talk to you more about that .
yeah sure .
i'll be happy to talk you through it .
whaou oh , whaou !
i took a ...
it's amazing .
sea urchess .
look what you got .

so uh ...
dana and i , we booked our tickets to southern france , you guys , we leave on the 15th next month .
oh , fun !
we're taking a food and wine tour .
does anybody want some of my lobster?
what's that sauce on it , bette?
i think it's lemon froth and shaved dry tuna roe .
whatever , it's good , right?
do you want some ...
do you want some lobster , moira?
no i'm fine , thanks .
well , it's not gonna bite ya .
no , i'm fine , thank you .
moira , don't you like lobster?
yeah , actually i like it a lot .
do you want some?
i don't think the claws have any sauce ...
i'm sorry i only have the tale left , but you know ...
if you want , you can have the tale and wipe the sauce off .
no that's cool .
are you sure?
yeah .
i know something interresting about lobsters .
what?
you don't have to put a lid on the pot when you cook female lobsters .
does anybody know why?
no
when you cook a pot of male lobsters , and they realize they're in this pot of boilling water , they all start totally freaking out .
they're like " fuck we gotta get out of here
and they start making these little ladders , and helping each other getting out of the pot .
so you have to put a lid on the pot to keep them inside .
but female lobsters , you don't have to put a lid on the pot .
because once they realize they're in a pot of boilling water ,
they all just start grabbing each other and they're like holding each other down .
if i'm gonna die , everyone's gonna die .
and none of them's want to let any of the others get out of the pot .
it's a real shame , isn't it?
whaou .
these crazy female lobsters ...
just get yourself down !
jenny , i'm just gonna go .
you'll get a ride home from carmen and shane .
uh , will you excuse me for a second?
moira?
moira !
what are you doing?
i'm just gonna go , okay?
why?
look , this sould cover me .
okay , i don't understand .
did something happened , just now?
they're your friends , i don't really fit in .
oh my god , moira .
they're getting to know you and ...
that's gonna take some time and they're gonna think your're fucking amazing when they get to know you .
maybe she kept jenny from felling lonely .
you know what it is , when you're ... with someone that's completly wrong for you .
just because you don't wanna be alone .
i don't know , maybe she's jenny's type .
oh yeah !
'cause carmen's such a stone butch too .
i wouldn't certainly call moira stone butch .
allright and what wold you describe her as?
miss " hi , let us butches help you ladies out with your luggage "?
right?
she comes from a place where ... you know , you have to define yourself as either or
it's probably the other language that she has to describe herself .
she has the language of the " chick kicking boobs " and that lumberjack walk .
i'm just surprised that she wanted to roleplay like that .
especially after everything that jenny's been through .
well , she could be completly different in the bedroom .
maybe she's " butch in the streets and femmme in the sheets
oh my god , that's so original .
you know what , what difference does that make whether someone is butch or femme?
leave the labels alone , just let people be who they are .
right .
what do you guys thought of that lobster thing anyway?
oh come on !
competitive female lobsters .
it's so not true !
is everything okay?
yeah .
do we have dessert?
and i love that child .
i fucked up , with my own .
oh , every parents fucks up one way or another .
no , i really fucked up .
i just left him , when he wasn't bigger than that .
i just dumped him with his stuff with his father and old school grand parents
and went off doing my music . now i don't really have a leg to stand on complaining about why he's a fondamentalist bigot
what do you think about that mr. mangus?
i think when you're called to play music , there's not a lot you can do about this .
sometimes , it pulls even stronger than that biological thing that bonds a mother to her child .
well , allright then .
good night , mr. mangus .
good night .
i will take that .
thanks .
oh bette , no no no no !
no yeah !
we should do the maths .
no , no no , i've got it .
no , really , it's jenny's comming home dinner and it would be my privilege .
thank you , that's very generous of you .
that's sweet bette .
you're welcome .
bette , thank you .
there you are .
i just wanna talk , okay?
i'm not gonna attack .
what do you want to talk to me about?
i just wanna know if you're happy .
yeah , i'm happy .
i mean , for the most part , i'm happy .
i'm glad one of us is .
okay .
sorry .
no , i'm sorry .
i'm sorry that you're unhappy i'm sorry that i made you unhappy .
but alice , i don't know ...
i don't know what to do .
what can i do?
i'm getting over this .
i am .
i'm working really hard to get over this .
maybe we could be friends again one day .
i would really love that .
i miss you .
come back to me then .
alice ...
okay .
okay .
i let you wash your hands .
i know how you like to wash your hands after you go to the bathroom .
everybody likes to wash their hands after they go to the bathroom .
yeah , but it's super cute the way you do it .
lorraine lawson
is everything okay?
hmm hmm .
what a day ...
whaou .
i'm sorry ma'am , but your credit card was declined .
you're kidding me .
i don't know how that's possible .
bette , no no no .
no , really , it's not a big deal .
you know , i bought some *** , they probably put me over the limit .
it's not a big deal .
oh , i remember .
i put a ...
stop .
bette , bette ...
jenny , no , you're still our gest of honour , no matter what .
yeah .
fine .
does this make you happy now?
helena , hi , it's tina .
i hope i'm not calling too late .
no ...
actually i've been thinking about your proposition .
and ...
i think i'd like to give it a try .
don't .
hey .
you heard anything from her?
no .
i'm sure she's okay .
she's a big girl , she can take care of herself .
i feel like such an asshole .
i should have gone with her .
i'm sorry we weren't more acomodating to your friends .
we were just excited to see you .
and generous about you and ...
i don't know .
i gess she should understood that .
