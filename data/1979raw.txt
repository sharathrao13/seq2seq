charles , isn't this great?
yeah .
good afternoon .
hi .
man, what wouldn't i do to get my hands on her?
get your hands on who?
the challenger $20 million airplane .
what did you think i meant?
come along , charles .
charles, you coming?
yeah .
i'm supposed to give you this .
ok .
charles morse the billionaire?
my god , is thatwho you are?
yeah .
stuff everything into the back .
i've taken the liberty of talking to the pilot .
i've checked the engine log .
the plane's in good shape .
good avionics .
the fella's been around .
try not to fly under any low ceiling , any possibility of bird strike , or ice .
what's bird strike?
flocks of migrating birds .
if we hit them, we're all dead .
absolutely .
especially this time of year .
any questions , i'll have a chopper here and fly you out .
we'll be fine .
i said you'd have a good time .
yeah .
when will you require your plane?
bob?
they want the film in 34 hours .
i'd say 8 : 00 tomorrow night .
eight o'clock tomorrow night .
yes , sir .
thank you .
oh , no !
you can't handle this northern weather?
i'll be all right .
it's your own fault .
hey , is that a new watch?
yeah .
dual time zone .
tells the time in two places .
what for?
if i want to know the time in new york ,
i don't have to add three .
look there .
right there .
so you built this place with your own hands?
yes , ma'am .
been building it all my life .
ok , right this way, folks .
you don't have to worry about keys 'cause we got no locks .
kitchen is always open .
you can fix whatever you like .
the bedrooms and outhouses are upstairs .
we want you to relax , kick off your shoes , and just get down home comfortable .
hey , stephen .
yeah?
this is what i'm talking about .
see?
that's what i want for tomorrow : an unsentimental photograph .
to get a truly unselfconscious photograph , you almost have to go back to the 19th century .
how old is that?
took it last fall .
that's jack hawk , a friend of mine .
you took the photo?
i took the photo .
he took the bear .
i'd be out hunting with him right now if you weren't here ... and i had my rifle sighted in .
you interested in books?
yeah .
why can't you get your rifle sighted in?
what?
why can't you get your rifle sighted in?
need to rig up a bench rest .
an ironing board makes a good bench rest .
no disrespect ... l'm surprised you know what a bench rest is .
charles knows what everything is .
got a question , ask him .
charles knows everything .
take a mighty accomplished man to claim that .
i don't claim anything .
ask him .
see if i'm wrong .
bet you can't stump him .
bet you i can .
tell you what ...
i will give you $5 . 00 ... if you can tell me what's on the other side of this blade .
it's a rabbit smoking a pipe .
hmm .
a rabbit smoking a pipe .
well, well, well .
why in the world would that be?
uh , it's a symbol of the cree lndians .
on one side there's the panther , on the other , his prey , the rabbit .
he sits unafraid .
he smokes his pipe .
it's a traditional motif .
why is he unafraid?
because he's smarter than the panther .
ha !
sir ... you impress me .
oh .
thank you .
amazing accomplishment .
no , it's not an accomplishment .
it's a freak .
ls that so?
yeah .
i seem to retain all these facts , but putting them to any useful purpose is another matter .
hmm .
oh , hey , listen up , folks .
we got a problem with bears around here .
never leave food uncovered , even in the lodge .
never .
you see a bear near you , stand still .
let him know that you know that he sees you .
and back up , hmm?
real slow .
anybody's in trouble , get my attention .
i'll be on it like a duck on a june bug .
now , make yourselves comfortable .
i think i'm going to bed .
shut up !
lord , i'm bushed .
new book?
yes .
it's about surviving in the wilderness .
you're always reading something .
yeah .
my secretary gave it to me .
do you know why?
huh?
you know why she gave me the book?
that guy gave me the creeps with all that talk about the bear .
why she gave you the book?
because you're the salt of the earth .
oh , is that so?
you're the most excellent man .
that's why i married you .
and you're the only woman i've ever wanted .
well, then ... see what a luck y guy you are?
yes , i do .
this is a special day for me .
i know it is .
i'm really glad you came away with us .
you should get away more often .
charles .
yeah?
can you go downstairs and get me a sandwich?
yeah , ok .
of course .
did i ever tell you you're an angel?
no .
everything but the wings .
a sandwich .
aah !

come on .
oh , god .
oh , shit .
i'm cold .
let's stopfucking about , shall we , and getthe guy warm .
hey , come on .
we need those .
we need them .
come on , stephen , come on .
come here .
i letthefire burn out .
we've only got afewflares left .
shouldn'twe keepthem for signaling?
whatwe need is ...
whatwe want is wood quite a bit of it, for a signalfire .
when they comefor us , they'll see the smoke .
huh?
why would they comefor us?
hmm?
well, they know we wentto the cabin .
when they go there , they'll see the note .
oh .
i'm afraid we're infor a walk .
what's that mean , 'we're infor a walk "?
whatthefuck does that mean?
i once read an interesting book .
it said that most people lost in the wilds, they ...
they die of shame .
what?
yeah .
they die of shame .
'what did i do wrong?
'how could i have gotten myself into this?
and so they sitthere , and they ... die .
they didn't do the one thing thatwould've saved their lives .
and what is that , charles?
thinking .
look .
steve , look .
all right , here's the lodge .
here's the cabin where we were supposed to have gone .
this is where we did go through this pass , mountains , river .
they'll be lookingfor us in the south , all right?
if we can get back south of this pass by tonight , we can use theflares .
how do wefind it in the woods?
head south .
aha .
we head south .
how do we know which way is south?
ok , uh ...
look .
pointthe hour hand atthe sun .
halfway between the hour hand and 12 : 00 is south .
this is broken .
give me yourwatch .
mine's busted, too .
steve?
it's lost .
ok .
all right , i'll tell you .
uh ... the birds will beflying south .
we'llfollow them .
what if we can't see them?
sorry i got us into this !
stopthat !
stop it !
just stop it .
where are you going?
gonna make a compass .
uh ...
right .
you take a needle , rub it on silk , magnetize it .
and , uh ...
here , place it on a leaf .
here .
you have a compass .
who travels with a needle?
ah .
here .
ha ha !
oh , shit .
you see? ltworks .
ltworks .
that peak is south .
what if it isn't?
huh?
it is .
has no choice .
it's drawn by the earth's magnetism .
i know how itworks , charles .
good .
then you know .
that's south .
what do we do when we getthere?
take another sighting .
it doesn'tfeel south , charles .
just because you're lost doesn't mean your compass is broken .
come on .
the vikings would steer their shipwith a rope .
a rope?
how'd they do that , charles?
they'd have these two set points on the land ... they'd left behind or sailed awayfrom , and they'd line them up , and thatwould be their bearing .
then they'd trail this long rope behind the ship , pointing it atthose two points the hill orwhatever .
you mightwantto conserve your breath .
oh, yeah .
yeah !
gotto getthrough by nightfall .
come on .
what are the odds thatthey'll see us , thatthey'll see theflares?
damnfine .
you think so?
i don't know , but i have to say so , don't l?
city boy .
charles .
yeah?
ls it my diseased imagination , or did you say ,
'how are you planning to kill me?
did you say that?
yeah .
what did that mean?
why would i wantto kill you , charles?
for my wife .
for mickey?
yeah .
that's a bizarre way to meet girls .
i'd kill you to get nextto yourwife?
i've seen you with her .
charles , baby ...
we worktogether .
no .
i've seen the way you are .
no offense , charles , but i can get my own girl , if you've noticed since we've known each other .
and p. s. , you're a powerful guy .
why would i want to antagonize you , charles?
forthe money .
oh .
the money .
now it's the broad , now it's the boodle .
nothing is safe .
rich man .
all anybody wants is to take somethingfrom you , and when they want it bad enough, to kill you .
you know something , charles?
the rich are different .
howfar do you think it is?
can't be more than about 10 miles .
aah !
what?
a stitch .
a stitch in my side .
find a round stone .
what?
find a round stone .
spit under it .
old lndian remedy?
yeah, that's right .
you think i'm afool .
no .
old lndian remedy .
makes sense .
make him slow down , find a round stone , take his mind off it , make him stretch , bend over .
you think i'm afool because of what i said .
aboutwhat?
about my wife .
ah, whatyou said aboutyourwife .
what i think ... l thinkthat you gottoo much money , uh ... latent homosexuality , lots of other good stuff , paranoia ...
we'll all gettogether when we get back , you and me and yourwife , and we'll get into a hottub ... and , um ... bare ourfeelings , and , um ...
look , even if i wanted to kill you , i need you to get home , youfucking idiot .
needing people .
lsn't it a bitch?
who are we talking about?
fannie farmer .
the mother of level measurement here .
good to know you have a hero .
oh , cheering up , are we?
regaining our impertinent , feisty demeanor , eh?
it's good of you to notice .
knows all, tells all .
