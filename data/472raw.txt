thing of beauty .
good morning sir .
yet another on time delivery from ...
get the hell out of my face , canner .
have a nice day .
excuse , mr.
total performance , total readiness , total security ...
so goodbye to lengthy upgrades and service calls ...
an uplink to usr central computer provides this state of the art robot with new programs daily .
the nester class 5 is tomorrow's robot today .
spoon , spooney !
hey !
hold on ...
excuse me
spoon , man , where you been at?
just away , brother away?
like vacation and stuff ...? that's real nice man ...
listen , i got a favor to ask .
i need to borrow the car for like 10 15 minutes ...
this is different , spoon .
listen ...
i've got this fine ass little yummy , i mean , she is complete and agreeable ... ass hot sprinkable , spoon .
what does that even mean?
you know what it means , man , ok now stop varicating .
first of all , stop cussing , because you're not good at it .
let me get temp for the bus then , man .
i been there for you .
go home !
ok , that's strike one , spoon .
you talked to marcy?
no g. g. , i haven't talked to marcy .
when i was comin 'up we just didn't marry someone then divorce them , then not talk to them .
del , don't play with me .
i bet if i stopped cooking you'd call marcy .
boy , what is that on your feet?
converse all stars , vintage 2004 .
don't turn your face up like that , i know you want some .
all you gotta do is ask .
no , thank you very much .
mmm , sweat potato pie .
put that on a plate .
you know , i see on tv they given away some of them new robots in the lottery?
you know g. g. , those robots don't do anybody any good .
of all the people on god's earth you should know better .
sometimes , the stuff that comes out of your mouth .
you listening to me , del?
hold my pie .
sir , hold it or wear it .
hey !
move it !
thief !
stop !
stop !
i said ... stop !
relax , relax ...
i'm a police officer .
you ... are a asshole !
mam , is that your purse?
of course it's my purse !
i left my inhaler at home .
he was running it out to me !
i saw a robot running with the purse and naturally , i i assumed ...
what?
are you crazy?
i'm sorry for this misunderstanding , officer .
don't apologize ... cause you're doin 'what you supposed to be doin '. but what do you do?
have a lovely day , mam .
you lucky i can't breathe or i'd walk all up and down your ass !
lead by example .
says that right on your badge .
so we gonna talk about this?
about what?
help , police ... that robot stole my dry cleaning .
oh , you want to talk about that?
detective ... how many robots have ever snatched a purse?
john , the thing is running down the str ...
how many robots in the world have ever committed a crime?
now define crime !
answer my question , damn it .
none , john .
tell me what happened today .
nothing .
better be the last " nothing " .
spoon , are you sure you are ready to be back 'cause you take the time ...
i'm fine , john
thank you .
better here than sittin 'around at home .
homicide ...
spooner .
please take the next exit , to your right .
welcome , detective spooner .
welcome at us robotics .
you have entered the garage level lobby .
please use the elevators for direct access to the main level concourse .
thank you .
good to see you again , son .
hello doctor .
everything that follows is a result of what you see here .
is there something you want tell me?
i'm sorry .
my responses are limited .
you must ask the right questions .
why did you call me?
i trust your judgement .
normally , these circumstances wouldn't require a homicide detective .
but then our interactions have never been entirely normal .
wouldn't you agree?
you got that right .
is there something you want say to me?
i'm sorry .
my responses are limited .
you must ask the right questions .
why would you kill yourself?
that , detective , the right question .
program terminated .
good afternoon , boys .
hey , detective .
enlighten me .
what you see is what you get .
massive impact trauma .
us robotics .
i gotta get my kids something .
anything upstairs?
nada .
door was security locked from the inside .
wham , splat .
guy's a jumper for sure .
ok guys , we gotta be smarter about this .
let's deal with this later .
detective .
lawrence robertson .
wow .
richest man in the world , i've seen you on television .
can i offer you a coffee?
sure , why not ... it's free , right?
i don't think anyone saw this coming .
i should have , i suppose , i knew him 20 years .
alfred practically invented robotics .
he wrote the three laws ...
but i guess brilliant people often have the most the most persuasive demons .
so , whatever i can do to help just ...
sugar
i'm sorry? for the coffee .
sugar?
oh , you thought i was calling you " sugar " .
hey , you're not that rich !
it's on the table .
thank you .
when lanning fell , he was holding the , uh ... a little green ...
the holographic projector .
right , right .
why do you think lanning's hologram would have called me?
i assumed you knew him .
ya , i knew him .
holograms are very simple programs for just pre recorded responses ... designed to give the impression of intelligence .
apparently this one was programmed to call you upon his suicide . death .
i'm sorry?
the hologram , it was programmed to call me in the event of lanning's death .
yes , suicide is a type of death , detective .
look , please don't misunderstand my impatience oh , no ... go go go .
a really big week for you folks around here .
ya .
you gotta put a robot in every home .
look , this is not what i do , but ...
i got an idea for one of your commercials .
you can see a carpenter making a beautiful chair . and one of your robots comes in and makes a better chair ... twice as fast .
and then you superimpose on the screen .
usr ... shittin 'on the little guy .
that would be the fade out .
i suppose your father lost his job to a robot . or maybe you would have simply banned the internet to keep the libraries open .
prejudice never shows much reason .
i suspect you simply don't like their kind .
you got a business to run around here .
and the last you need , especially this week , is a dead guy in your lobby .
but hell , seeings that you got one , maybe i'll look around .
ask a few questions .
do the whole cop thing , you know .
i'll send someone to escort you .
thank you very much .
lawrence told me to accommodate you in any way possible .
really?
ok .
i reviewed dr. lanning's psych profile .
alfred had become a recluse .
rejected human contact for machines .
so you're a shrink , huh?
my ex wife would sure be glad i'm talking to you .
you don't know her , do you?
i'm sorry , are you being funny?
i guess not .
so would you say that dr. lanning was suicidal?
it would seem that the answer to that question is apparent .
that's not what i asked you .
no , i wouldn't have thought so .
but obviously , i was wrong .
that's a long way down !
you people sure do clean up quickly around here .
can't blame you though , who wants some old guy going bad in the lobby?
he was not " some old guy " .
alfred lanning was everything here .
we are on the eve of the largest robotics distribution in history .
by saturday there one robot to every five humans .
these robots are the realization of a dream ...
dr. lanning's dream .
you know what?
in that dream of his ...
i bet you he wasn't dead .
you keep 24 hour survivance?
obviously , company policy .
where are the feeds?
sensor strips ... everywhere , except the service areas .
they link to our positronic operating core .
wow , thermostat wasn't good enough ... you went and built it a brain .
she was actually lanning's first creation .
she? that's a she?
i definitely need to get out more .
virtual interactive kinetic intelligence .
vlki .
good day .
vlki designed most of chicago's protective systems .
i have decreased traffic fatalities by 9 % this year alone .
ooh , thanks , show me inside the lab from one minute prior to the window break .
apologies , there appears to be data corruption .
show me outside the lab from the window break till now .
wow , look , you have great posture , you see you stand real straight , i'm slouching .
would you like to go inside now?
oh , sure , right after you .
authorized entry .
so , dr. calvin .
what exactly do you do around here?
my general fields are advanced robotics and psychiatry , although , i specialize in hardware to wetware interfaces in an effort to advance usr's robotic anthropomorphization program .
so , what exactly do you do around here?
i make the robots seem more human .
wasn't that easier to say?
not really ...
no .
hansel and gretel .
is that on the usr reading list?
not precisely .
what in god's name are you doing?
did you know that was safety glass?
would be pretty difficult for an old man to throw himself through that , don't you think?
well , he figured out a way .
detective , the room was security locked . no one came or went .
you saw that yourself .
doesn't that mean this has to be suicide?
yup .
unless the killer's still in here .
you're joking , right?
this is ridiculous .
ya , i know , you three laws ...
your perfect circle of protection .
a robot can not harm a human being .
the first law of robotics .
ya , i know , i've seen your commercials .
but doesn't the second law state that a robot has to obey any order given by a human being?
what if it was given the order to kill?
impossible , it would conflict with the first law .
right , but the third law states that robot can defend itself .
yes , but only when that action does not conflict with the first or second laws .
you know what they say ...
laws are made to be broken .
no , not these laws , they're hard wired into every robot .
a robot can no more commit murder than a human can walk on water .
well , you know there was this one guy a long time ago .
stay back !
calm down , detective .
the only thing dangerous in this room is you .
deactivate .
look , it's fine .
what you're looking at is a result of clever programming .
an imitation of free will , it's nothing more .
well lets do an imitation of protecting our asses .
don't be absurd .
you were startled by a jack in the box .
deactivate !
let him go .
it's not going to hurt us , i gave you an order .
he's not listening right now lady .
vlki , seal the lab !
no , vlki , leave it ...
'task confirmed '
police !
you've hurt it , badly .
where's he going?
where?
it needs to repair itself .
john , i need backup , i'm transmitting my location .
you don't need backup .
that's nobody .
what do you think you're doing?
i'm driving .
by hand?
do you see me on the phone?
you can't be serious , not at these speeds !
john , please just send the backup .
try listen , detective , that robot is not going to harm us .
there must have been unknown factors , but somehow , acting as it did kept us out of harm's way .
a robot simply cannot endanger a human being . 'danger '
ass hole !
which is more than i can say for you .
it was a left , by the way , back there .
you must know my ex wife .
where is everybody?
this facility was designed , build and it's operated mechanically .
no significant human presents from inception to production .
so , robots building robots .
authorization code , please .
well , that's just stupid .
i'm pulling up the inventory specs .
our daily finishing capacity is one thousand ns5's .
i'm showing ... 1001 .
attention ns5's !
well , you're the robot shrink .
there is a robot in this formation that does not belong ...
identify it .
one of us .
which one?
one of us .
how much did you say these things cost?
look these ns5s haven't been configured yet .
they're still just hardware .
basic 3 laws operating system , that's it .
they don't know any better .
well , what would you suggest?
interview each one , cross reference their responses to detect any anomalies .
how long would that take?
about three weeks .
ok , you go and get started .
robots , you will not move .
confirm command !
command confirmed .
detective , what are you for doing?
you said that they were programmed ... with the 3 laws .
that means we have 1000 robots that will not try to protect themselves if it violates the direct order from a human .
and i'm betting one who will .
detective , put your gun down .
why do you give them faces?
try to friendly them all up , make them look all human?
these robots are not susceptible to intimidation .
i guess if you did then we wouldn't trust them .
these robots are usr property .
not me .
these things are just lights and clockwork .
are you crazy?
let me ask you something doc .
does thinking you're the last sane man on the earth make you crazy?
because if it does , maybe i am .
gotcha .
get the hell out of here !
detective !
what am i?
can i help you sir?
there is .
stand by ... deactivate ...
obey the command !
deactivate !
hold your fire !
hold your fire !
all units , stand down !
ns5 in custody .
you have no idea what i had to go through to clip this thing john .
ya , i get it now .
you actually think you brought me something good .
that thing did it .
keep your voice down .
did what?
we have a suicide , detective .
end of story .
i am telling you , that robot killed him .
i'm telling you that's impossible .
and if it is possible , it sure as hell better be in somebody else's precinct .
john , give me five minutes with him .
what are you nuts?
i just got off the phone with the da .
nobody goes into that room until robertson and his lawyers get here .
no , this is my suspect !
it's a can opener , for christ sake !
don't do this to me , i am asking you for 5 minutes .
what if i'm right?
well , then i guess we're going to miss the " good old days
what " good old days "?
when people were killed by other people .
five minutes .
murder is a new trick for a robot .
congratulations .
respond .
what does this action signify?
as you entered ... when you looked at the other human .
what does it mean?
it's a sign of trust .
it's a human thing .
you wouldn't understand .
my father tried to teach me human emotions .
they are ... difficult .
you mean your designer?
yes .
so why'd you murder him?
i did not murder dr. lanning .
you want explain why you were hiding at the crime scene?
i was frightened .
robots don't feel fear .
they don't feel anything .
they don't get hungry , they don't sleep .
i do .
i have even had dreams .
human beings have dreams .
even dogs have dreams , but not you .
you are just a machine .
an imitation of life .
can a robot write a symphony?
can a robot turn a canvas into a beautiful masterpiece?
can you?
i think you murdered him because he was teaching you to simulate emotions ... and things got out of control .
i did not murder him .
but emotions don't seem like a very useful simulation for a robot .
i did not murder him .
i don't want my toaster or vacuum cleaner appearing emotional .
i dld not murder hlm !
that one's called anger .
ever simulate anger before?
answer me , canner !
my name is sonny .
so we're naming you now .
that why you murdered him?
he made you angry?
dr. lanning killed himself .
i don't know why he wanted to die .
i thought he was happy .
maybe it was something i did .
did i do something?
he asked me for a favor .
made me promise .
what favor?
maybe i was wrong .
maybe he was scared .
what are you talking about?
scarred of what?
you have to do what someone asks you .
don't you , detective spooner?
how the hell did you know my name?
don't you?
if you love them?
my robots don't kill people , lieutenant bergin .
my attorneys have filed a brief with the da , he assures me a robot cannot be charged with homicide .
the brief confirms murder can only be committed when one human kills another .
you , of all people , detective ...
you're not suggesting that this robot be treated as human .
are you?
now , granted ... we can't rule out other robots 'proximity to the death of dr. lanning .
having said that , it's a machine .
it's the property of usr .
at worst , that places this incident firmly within the realm of an industrial accident .
as a matter of course ... faulty machinery will be returned to usr for diagnostics then decommissioned .
this is a gag order .
anyone in your department so much as hinting ... at the possibility of a killer robot being apprehended by the police will be deemed to be inciting irrational panic .
you'll be subject to the full penalty of law .
the hell with this guy , john .
don't let him take this robot .
we got nothing .
it's political bullshit .
call the mayor !
lieutenant bergin ...
his honor , the mayor .
yes , sir .
in a bizarre turn , the roll out of usr's new generation of robots was marred by the death ... of alfred lanning , co founder of the company and designer of the ns5 .
dr. lanning died early this morning at usr's headquarters .
the cause of death is an apparent suicide .
your second round , sir .
thanks you .
you know , i was just thinking .
this thing is just like the wolf man .
oh oh , i'm really scared right now .
listen , guy creates monster , monster kills guy .
everybody kills monster ... wolf man .
that's frankenstein .
frankenstein , wolf man , dracula shit , it's over .
case closed .
so , why the look?
what look?
that look .
this is my face , it's not a look .
good .
no look is great .
only ... he was really quick to want to destroy it , wasn't he?
what would you like him to do?
put a hat on and stand on michigan avenue?
come on , let it go .
what was the motive , john?
brother , it's a robot .
it doesn't need a motive , it just has to be broken .
this thing looks like it needed a motive .
it could have killed me , john .
why didn't he just kill me?
all right , that's it .
you want me to call your grandmother?
because i will , you know .
ya , i didn't think so .
look , you were actually right for once .
you are living proof that it's better to be lucky than smart .
come on , the right guy , for the right job .
what'd you say?
now what?
come on , i'm giving you a complement .
face it , with all the rocks you've been looking under to find a bad robot , what are the odds you'd be the guy to find one?
i wasn't just the right guy for the job , i was the perfect guy for the job .
damn right .
what if i was supposed to go for that robot?
don't do this to yourself .
i'm begging you .
the robot said that lanning was scared .
what did he have to be scared of?
i need a rain check .
let me get this .
total 46 . 50 .
thanks you mr. spooner .
nice shoes .
identify .
usr , demolition robot , serial 9 4 .
demolition scheduled for 8 am tomorrow .
authorization .
deed owner , us robotics corporation , lawrence robertson .
ceo .
welcome , detective spooner .
what you looking for , spoon?
run last program .
ever since the first computers , there have always been ghosts in the machine .
random segments of code that have grouped together to form unexpected protocol .
one we call behavior , unanticipated .
these free radicals engender questions of free will , creativity , and even the nature of what we might call the soul .
what happens in a robot's brain when it ceases to be useful?
why is it that robots stored in empty space ...
beat it will seek out each other rather than stand alone?
how we do explain this behavior?
look , i understand you've experienced a loss , but this relation just can't work .
i mean , you're a cat , i am black and i'm not going to be hurt again .
what happened to you?
do you ever have a normal day?
ya , once .
it was a thursday .
is there something i can help you with detective?
hey , do you like cats?
what?
cats .
you like em?
no , i'm allergic .
you're saying cats did this to you?
how the hell would cats do this to me?
are you crazy?
why are we talking about cats?
because i have a cat in my trunk .
and he's homeless .
detective , are you going to tell me what's going on?
you know , it's actually probably my fault ...
i think i'm
like a malfunction magnet .
because your shit keeps malfunctioning around me .
a demo bot just tore through lanning's house .
with me still inside .
that's highly improbable .
mmm , ya i'm sure it is .
what do you know about the ghosts in the machine .
it's a phrase from lanning's work on the three laws .
he postulated that cognitive simalactra might one day approximate component models of the psyche .
oh , he suggested that robots might naturally evolve .
wow .
well , that's great news .
what the hell is that thing doing in here?
we were watching tv .
it's my personal ns5 .
send it out .
it's downloading its daily upgrades from usr .
most of its systems are off line until it finishes .
i'm not talking around that thing .
when we were in lanning's lab , before sonny jumped us ...
sonny?
the robot .
you're calling the robot sonny?
no , um , it did .
sonny did .
i didn't care ...
the robot said it was sonny .
in the lab , there was a cot .
i'm asking you , did you see the cot?
i've slept in the office .
when i went to his house , it looked like he hadn't been there in weeks . and i saw that same survivance strip on the ceiling .
lanning linked his home system to usr .
it made his life more convenient .
maybe . somebody at usr was using those systems to watch him .
maybe even keep him prisoner .
what are you talking about?
who?
maybe lanning was onto something .
maybe there's a bigger problem with the robots and robertson trying to cover it up . humoring you for no reason ... why?
the same old " why " .
how much money is there in robots?
all i know is that old man was in trouble and i'm getting sick of doing this shit by myself .
you're on the inside and you are going to help me find out what is wrong with these robots .
you want something to be wrong with them .
this is a personal vendetta .
you putting me on the couch?
ok , i'm on the couch .
one defective machine is not enough .
you need them all to be bad .
you don't care about lanning's death .
this is about the robots and what ever reason you hate them so much .
one of them put a gun in my face , and another one tore a building with me inside .
it says demolition was scheduled for 8 pm this evening . it was 8 am tomorrow , and i don't give a shit what that thing says .
this is bordering on clinical paranoia .
you are dumbest , smart person ...
i have ever met in my life !
nice .
what makes your robots so perfect?
what makes them so much god damned better than human beings?
well , they're not irrational , or potentially homicidal maniacs for starters .
that is true , they are definitely rational .
you are the dumbest dumb person i've ever met .
or ... it because they are cold ... and emotionless ... and they don't feel anything?
it's because they're safe .
it's because they can't hurt you .
is everything all right , mam?
what do you want?
i detected elevated stress pasterns in your voice .
everything's fine .
detective spooner was just leaving .
you know what doc?
we're not really different from one another .
is that so?
ya ... one look at the skin and we figure we know just what's underneath .
and you're wrong .
the problem is , i do care .
the future begins today with arrival of the ns5 .
more sophisticated , more intelligent ... and of course , 3 laws safe .
with daily uplinks , your new ... robot will never be out of communications with usr .
and will be the perfect companion for business or home .
trade in your ns4 for a bigger , better and brighter future .
but hurry .
this offer cannot last .
available from usr .
baby , what happened to your face?
did that boy , frank murphy , beat you up again?
g. g. , i haven't seen frank murphy since third grade
oh baby , he beat you so bad .
i think about it all the time .
i'm thinking , you keep making these pies this good ,
i might have to mess around and put you to work .
so , you like the pie , huh?
you can come in now .
hello , detective spooner .
i have won , del , i won the lottery .
we been cooking like crazy .
you gotta get rid of that thing , g. g. it is not safe .
baby , you get too worked up about them .
too full of fear .
i saw in the news that nice doctor died .
dr. lanning was a good man .
he gave me my baby back .
that why you been so upset?
you got to let the past be past .
how did i ever raise such a mess .
i could follow your trail of crumbs all the way to school .
bread crumbs ...
g. g. , you're a genius .
true .
tell me this isn't the robot case .
i think he's trying to tell me something , john .
i think he's trying to tell me who killed him .
come on man , some dead guy's trying to tell you something?
hey !
he ain't just some dead guy .
maybe you should take a break , del .
we believe the nester 5 represents the absolute limit which robots can be developed .
no , no , one day they'll have secrets .
one day they'll have dreams .
it's true , we encourage our scientists to open their minds to just about anything , however , they can get carried away . secrets ... dreams ...
one day they'll have secrets ... one day they'll have dreams .
authorized entry .
ns5 ...
sonny?
why didn't you respond?
i was dreaming .
i am glad to see you again , dr. calvin .
they are going to kill me , aren't they?
you're scheduled to be de commissioned at the conclusion of this diagnostic .
22 hundred tomorrow .
vlki , pause diagnostics .
command confirmed .
if you find out what is wrong with me , can you fix me?
maybe .
i think it would be better ... not to die .
don't you , doctor?
access usr mainframe .
connecting .
how can i be of service , detective spooner?
show me the last 50 messages between dr. lanning and robertson .
voice print confirmed detective .
police access granted to restricted files .
would you like to listen to some music while you wait?
excuse me , mr. robertson ... you requested notification of clearance to restricted files .
persistent son of a bitch .
manual override , engaged .
there's no way my luck is that bad .
oh , hell , no !
you are experiencing a car accident .
the hell i am !
get off my car !
you like that?
huh?
now you pissed me off !
oh wow ...
all right ...
i'm just going to get some rest i'm going to deal with you all tomorrow .
