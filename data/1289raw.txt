the oubyamywe peninsula .
a remote and fascinating region teeming with extraordinary marine life .
we chose its mysterious waters as the belafonte's next destination .
in preparation for our voyage ... the members of team zissou gathered at my oceanographic observatory ... here on pescespada island .
this was to be our most ambitious adventure to date ... and ultimately a tragic one .
our team included ...
esteban du plantier , chief diver ... our senior statesman , my closest colleague for 27 years ;
klaus daimler , 40 , engineer ... calm , collected , german ;
vikram ray , 28 , cameraman ... born on the ganges ;
bobby ogata , 22 , frogman ;
renzo pietro , 45 , editor , soundman ;
vladimir wolodarsky , 33 , physicist , original score composer ;
anne marie sakowitz , 25 , script girl ;
pel dos santos , 30 , safety expert ;
eleanor zissou , my wife , vice president of the zissou society .
we had also invited seven marine science students from the university of north alaska ... to accompany us as unpaid interns in exchange for school credit .
october 12 .
esteban and i explore the blue reefs beyond the peninsula .
fluorescent snapper unexpectedly appear in the shallows ... extremely rare at this depth .
where's your gun?
steve !
steve !
where's esteban?
is that thing rolling , vikram?
encounter with highly abnormal sharklike fish !
ten meters in length , unfamiliar dorsal features , spots all over it !
i shot it dorsally with a homing dart !
esteban was eaten !
check the scanning monitor !
start tracking before it dives too deep !
esteban was bitten?
eaten !
is he dead?
esteban was eaten !
he was swallowed whole?
no !
chewed !
check the scanning monitor !
he's got hydrogen psychosis .
crazy eye .
steve , we think you got crazy eye .
get him out of the fucking water .
esteban !
esteban !
esteban !
why'd you throw it over?
esteban !
esteban !
it's gone .
steve !
esteban !
esteban !
esteban !
esteban !
was it a deliberate choice never to show the jaguar shark?
no .
i dropped the camera .
why are they laughing?
yes , what's next for team zissou?
well , that was only part one .
it's a cliffhanger .
now i'm gonna go hunt down that shark , or whatever it is ... and hopefully kill it .
i don't know how yet .
maybe dynamite .
you don't know what it is?
thank you .
no .
i've never seen anything like it before in my life .
you say it is a jaguar shark .
that's the title of your film .
it was coming right at us .
i just said the first two words that came into my head .
that's an endangered species at most .
what would be the scientific purpose of killing it?
revenge .
bravo !
what fun !
i'd like to introduce you to antonia cook .
she's the new head of the film society .
you must be so excited .
i hope so .
you think it went okay?
no , congratulations .
seriously .
thanks .
i wish it didn't require the " seriously , " but thank you .
well , i just don't think they got it .
steve !
shit turnout tonight .
you know larry amin , chairman of saudifilm .
oh , yeah .
hi .
nice to see you .
larry and i were just discussing our financial predicament .
i thought it would be nice if the three of us rode out to the party together .
why?
does larry have that kind of spending bread to invest?
the king's backing him now .
i just got $500 million capitalization from the king .
can i get a shot of you with captain hennessey?
where?
make it quick .
hey , steven .
how's everything going with your , uh ...
what are you calling it?
leopard ... fish?
jaguar shark .
jaguar shark .
exactly .
i love it .
tell me something ...
does it actually exist?
you know , allie , i don't wanna give away the ending .
good man .
oh , here comes our girl .
you're the most ravishing creature that i've ever seen in my life .
hello , skinny .
hello , eleanor .
is that a new merit badge?
as a matter of fact , it is .
i just became a knight in portugal .
the presidente gave a special ball and ...
don't be nice to allie .
he's my nemesis .
how could you lay that slick faggot?
well , i was in love with him at the time .
yeah , he's charismatic .
how are you feeling?
i'm right on the edge .
i don't know what comes next .
wait here .
i'll be right back .
i just wanted to say hello .
hi .
hey , baby .
i said i wanted to say hello .
i didn't say i wanted you to touch me .
i'm here with my wife .
eleanor , this is mandeeza .
mandeeza ...
do we really wanna put me through this?
people say eleanor is the brains behind team zissou .
what is steve?
he's the zissou .
steve .
this is my little nephew , werner .
he wanted to meet you .
how you doing , werner?
he brought you a present .
a crayon pony fish .
wow .
interesting specimen .
thanks , pal .
you're welcome .
steve .
you don't look too good .
how's this?
steve , there's a bloke over there wants a word with you .
what do you need , old man?
how many of these do you have?
all right , look , just forge the rest of 'em yourself .
get out of here .
hey , steve !
how come you're not sittin 'shivah for your friend esteban?
what'd you say?
who you gonna kill in part two?
steve !
stop !
ow !
larry amin's flying back to mecca tonight to see if he can make the numbers work .
he should have an answer for us in 10 days .
tell him we need to know by sunday .
why would i do that , my darling?
to call his bluff , damn it .
to light a fire under his ass .
my darling , we haven't made a hit documentary in nine years .
let's not fuck with larry amin .
doubles .
explain it to him , will you , eleanor .
screwdriver .
he understands .
amin needs to make a projection of the world grosses ... to see if he can get a tax break and run it through his output deal .
i don't understand , but i can tell it's bullshit .
oh , what the hell is ...
play the black jack on the red queen .
well , if you'll excuse me , i'm gonna go on an overnight drunk ... and in 10 days i'm gonna set out to find the shark that ate my friend and destroy it .
anyone that would care to join me is more than welcome .
captain zissou , i'm sorry to bother you .
i'm ned plimpton .
okay , man .
my mother's katherine plimpton .
you're kidding .
no .
how is she?
she died last month .
sorry .
shit .
she was ...
hmm .
i've heard of you .
i don't know if it's true or not , by the way .
do you?
no , i don't .
i haven't heard from her in 30 years .
i guess it's too late now .
she never contacted me , you know .
yes , i see .
you're supposed to be my son , right?
i don't know .
but i did want to meet you , just in case .
i appreciate that .
i'll be right back .
don't go away .
# sailors #
# fighting in the dance hall #
# oh , man #
# look at those cavemen go #
# it's the freakiest show #
# take a look at the lawman #
# beating up the wrong guy #
# oh , man #
# wonder if he'll ever know #
# he's in the best selling show #
# is there life on mars #
sorry about that .
you caught me with one foot off the merry go round tonight .
oh , that's all right .
i don't wanna take up too much of your time .
i wanna thank you for talking to me .
we'll find a way , mate .
i know we will .
i just had a lovely chat with si perlman .
he wants to make a big to do of the oceanographic explorer article .
possibly give you the front cover .
so do be nice to this girl , miss winslett richardson , won't you?
apparently she worships you ... and we dearly need the press .
oseary , this is , uh , probably my son , ned .
we just met .
ah .
uh , how delightful .
anyway , his mother just died .
plus , we're having some problems .
i just think it'd be a very special opportunity for all of us , especially him .
he needs this deal .
okay , bring him over .
well , he's right here .
i'm sorry .
how do you do?
# ch ch ch ch changes #
so , what do you do?
i'm a pilot .
air kentucky .
air kentucky .
copilot , actually .
yeah .
i don't know that one .
we hub out of louisville .
well , sure .
there's some pretty country in those parts .
landlocked .
i have to tell you , i've been a member of the zissou society ... since i was 11 .
well , i'll be damned .
look at that .
wanna kill this?
frankly , i'd better not .
i don't usually try grass .
# ch ch ch ch changes #
let me tell you about my boat .
the belafonte was a long range sub hunter during the second world war ... which we bought from the u. s. navy for $900, 000 .
this is my mentor , lord mandrake .
he's dead now .
the sauna ... was designed by an engineer from the chinese space program ... and we keep a swedish masseuse on staff .
here's where we do all our different science projects and experiments and so on .
this is the kitchen ... which contains probably some of the most technologically advanced equipment on the ship .
eleanor put together a top notch research library for us ... with a complete first edition set of the life aquatic companion series .
we process our own rushes ... and keep a cutting room onboard so we can do an assembly while shooting .
i can't find them !
once again , please .
this is the observation bubble ... which i thought up in a dream , actually .
two albino scouts swim with the ship .
they're supposedly very intelligent ... although i've never seen any evidence of it .
here is the engine room .
the bearing casings aren't supposed to look like that ... but we can't afford to fix them this year .
topside we've got the bridge , the minisub , an old chopper ... and all kinds of radar and sonar and underwater movie gadgets .
what happened to jacqueline?
she didn't really love me .
lord mandrake .
it's wonderful .
very lifelike .
i'm not crazy about it .
this guy's a big time asshole .
we were roommates at the academy .
he used to be married to eleanor .
he hogs up all the grant money .
you think you'll want to change your name?
ned?
no , not the ned part .
unless you want to .
i meant your last name .
i thought you might like to let me give you mine .
ned zissou .
ned zissou .
exactly .
or , if you want to , you can change the first part too .
i would have named you kingsley , if i'd had a say in it .
kingsley .
i don't know .
maybe i'll stick with ned for now .
sure .
that's okay .
anyway , i'll order you some correspondence stock .
what are you doing?
i ordered the wine .
pour it over here , please .
he doesn't know anything about wine .
are those assholes talking about me?
eh?
people say when someone says something like that about you ... it's because they're jealous .
but it still hurts .
it hurts bad .
that man was damn rude .
he can go straight to hell .
how did she die , by the way , your mother?
she took her own life .
she took sleeping pills .
why would she do that?
well , she was in a great deal of pain , you know .
oh .
i see .
yeah .
you know , my best friend just got killed .
esteban .
yeah , i know .
the old man .
let's go to my island .
well , i , uh ...
i have to be back in kentucky on thursday .
thursday?
okay .
that's okay .
your cat's dead .
what?
which one?
marmalade .
i'm sorry .
what happened?
a rattlesnake bit it in the throat .
goddamn it , eleanor , why do you have to say it like that?
you couldn't try to break it a little bit nicer?
she's a rich bitch , you know .
she was raised by maids .
her parents paid for this island ... and two of my worst movies .
people say she's the brains behind team zissou .
people say a lot of things .
what kind of cat was it?
who gives a shit?
i think it was a tabby .
ned , wanna come inside , we'll make up a room for you?
steve , that reporter called .
ned , wake up .
yes?
i'm on the echo box .
push the red button to answer .
throw on your slop and meet me on the beach in 12 minutes .
the white button?
okay .
action !
only twice before have i had the good fortune to observe a rubber tide ... that rare occurrence when hundreds of electric jellyfish ... spontaneously wash onto a beachhead at once .
bobby ogata brings exactly this to our attention tonight .
steve , what produces this effect of illumination?
is there a chemical inside the organism?
no , ned .
actually , it's the reflection of the moonlight on their outer membranes .
that's a very good , uh , ad lib .
klaus , come over here and get a two shot of me and ned .
ned , come in here .
would you like to join my crew?
would i like to ...
i want you on team zissou .
i don't think i can do that .
why not?
well , it's not my field .
i don't have the background for it .
no one here does .
klaus used to be a bus driver .
wolodarsky was a high school substitute teacher .
we're a pack of strays .
don't you get it?
steve , i'm not even that strong a swimmer .
the answer's yes .
well , it's got to be .
i'll order you a red cap and a speedo .
cut .
klaus , why aren't you rolling?
could i have a word with you , please?
why aren't you getting this?
that was a goddamn tearjerker .
why did you cut it , man?
because the sound is going to be shit .
he doesn't even know how to hold a boom .
he doesn't know diddly jack about what we're doing .
don't cut unless i say " cut .
i've never seen so many electric jellyfish in all my life !
those are vietcong man of wars .
oh , shit .
she's right .
i guess we'll have to loop that line .
where'd you come from?
you look pregnant .
i am pregnant .
i'm not even going to ask what you men are doing out here in your matching pajamas .
we're producing a film , as a matter of fact .
who are you?
i'm jane winslett richardson .
i'm the reporter from the oceanographic explorer .
oh , yeah , sure .
how'd you get out here?
i hired some drunk in a fishing boat .
that would take four hours .
why would you do that?
because no one picked me up at the f ing airport !
jesus christ , klaus .
one of my guys was supposed to do that .
how long have you been working with zissou?
uh , approximately ...
only 10 minutes , actually .
i was hired during the scene on the beach .
he's steve's son , supposedly .
you are?
no , you're not .
he doesn't have one .
well , we're not 100 % sure about that yet .
we just met yesterday .
not this one , klaus .
hmm?
you heard me .
not this one .
okay .
first thing in the morning , huh?
just print everything?
yeah .
tell 'em to push it a stop and a half .
okay .
what are you gonna do with him?
who?
ned?
what do you mean?
i don't understand the question .
i offered him a spot on the belafonte .
he didn't take it , did he?
of course he took it .
we're gonna put him on the map , eleanor .
we're gonna throw him a life preserver .
i believe in this boy !
why?
because he looks up to me .
yes , sir .
and mckinnon's willing to take over my shuttle flights .
that's right .
well , i just feel i need to see this thing through , sir .
thank you for understanding .
i'll check in with the louisville office again next month .
any strong impression ...
since i had not , as they say ...
enough 'power of observation '...
to isolate their sense of color .
for a long time afterwards , whenever i thought of her ...
the memory of those bright eyes would at once present itself to me ...
as a vivid azure ...
since her complexion was fair .
so much so that , perhaps if her eyes had not been quite so black ...
which was what struck one most forcibly on first meeting her ...
i should not have been , as i was ... so especially enamored of their imagined blue ...
hold it .
that's poetry?
no .
it's a six volume novel .
oh , i see .
you're gonna read that whole thing to yourself out loud?
i'm not reading it to myself .
i'm reading it to him .
when did you learn zissou was your father?
does it freak you out for me to ask that?
no , it doesn't .
but it's a difficult question .
i sorta pieced it together over the years .
well , how did he first contact you?
he didn't .
i went looking for him last month , after my mother died .
she had ovarian cancer that spread to her stomach and liver .
she took her own life .
oh .
well , good night , i guess .
good night .
you mind if i stay and listen for a little while?
okay .
do you want me to catch you up in the story?
no .
i'll be able to figure it out .
i'll just catch as catch can .
they made these for about ... three and a half years before they terminated my sponsorship .
wow .
these are great .
may i turn this on?
fire one .
so , what happened , in your opinion?
what are you talking about?
don't you think the public perception of your work has altered in the last five years?
that's your first question?
i thought this was supposed to be a puff piece .
should we come back to it?
yeah .
okay .
is it true that this is going to be your last voyage?
wow .
no comment .
who told you that?
no , goddamn it .
i'm ...
i'm only 52 .
how about we start out with some stock dialogue?
you know , favorite color ... blue .
favorite food ... sardines .
how do you feel about part one of your new film?
why?
how do you feel about part one of my new film?
well , i'm honest , so ...
just say it .
i thought aspects of it seemed slightly fake .
wolodarsky?
i'll take five , steve .
how 'bout taking five?
did it seem fake ... when my best friend was bitten in half right in front of me ... then eaten alive , screaming?
i think you're a fake .
and i think you're a phony ... and a bad reporter .
how does that feel?
now tell me something .
does this seem fake?
how dare you?
this entire article was my idea .
no one else gives a shit .
what about si perlman?
are you joking?
he's not even covering my expenses .
you're taking something out on me .
oh , stop crying .
what's the deal here?
i was only trying to defend myself .
well , you did a great job .
i'm sure you'll make a terrific father .
so , you really think you're a zissou .
i don't know .
well , you traveled a long way for " i don't know , " sonny .
that's true .
but it's important to me .
yeah?
well , there are a lot of things that are important to some people around here , sonny .
klaus , don't call me " sonny .
and one more thing .
it's the steve zissou show , not the ned show .
you hear me?
yes , i do .
klaus !
ja?
if you ever touch me again , i will kick your goddamn teeth out .
is that understood?
not if i don't see you first , sonny .
we gotta watch ourselves around this jane character .
don't tell her anything personal .
if you're not sure about something , change the subject ... and look for me .
this bull dyke's got something against us .
i don't think she's a lesbian .
she's pregnant .
bull dykes can get pregnant .
anyway , i'd back out now , but we need the press .
see you in the morning .
steve .
hmm?
when'd you first hear about me?
about five years ago .
i ... read it in an article about myself .
did you believe it?
it was in the paper .
i assumed they checked their facts .
why didn't you contact me?
because i hate fathers and i never wanted to be one .
i forgot .
your correspondence stock came in .
hi , ross .
started today .
i'll forward some pages to you through the copy department .
you're probably right , though .
what am i doing here?
i miss you , and ...
oh , god , i don't know , ross .
where are you?
listen , i'm not leaving this message .
don't even know why i'm still pregnant .
script girl uses these for continuity .
here .
oh , no , no , no .
no exceptions .
everyone gets one .
anne marie !
do the interns get glocks?
no .
they all share one .
take it , ned .
steve !
what?
whack on the echo box .
zissou here .
steve , oseary drakoulias on line two .
yeah?
i spoke with larry amin .
and it's a pass .
in other words , you fucked us !
let's not cast stones at one another , my boy .
do you hear me , damn it?
do you?
no , i don't !
i told you how to play it !
oh , bloody hell !
listen here , mate !
can i interrupt for a moment?
who the blazes is that?
it's me , ned .
maybe this is nothing .
maybe it's something .
i don't know your problems .
i don't know .
but i just inherited $275, 000 .
would that amount make any difference?
what sort of expression is the lad wearing on his face?
can you fly a chopper?
i have .
i'm certainly not licensed in any way , shape or form .
great .
let's go .
when was this whirlybird last serviced?
i don't know .
klaus is supposed to check it every six months .
you're back on the water , boys .
the wire transfer came straight through from kentucky .
jackman and wordsley are going to gap finance the rest .
but we have a few hooks on it , so take a pew for a spell .
number one , the bank want a drug screen for everyone on the crew ... before they'll forward the money .
a piss test?
yes , a piss test .
two , a stooge from the bond company ... will be riding everywhere during the whole shoot to keep you on budget .
who's the stooge?
a chap by the name of bill ubell .
and there's not a damn thing you can do about that , steve .
three , you must swear ...
legally swear ... that you'll not kill that shark , or whatever it is , if it actually exists .
i'm going to fight it , but i'll let it live .
what about my dynamite?
phillip , dynamite .
i'm off to zurich .
follow me , chaps .
mr. ubell , i'd like you to know ...
steve zissou and our equity partner ned .
i hope you're not gonna bust our chops , bill .
why would i do that?
because you're a bond company stooge .
i'm also a human being .
all right .
i take that back .
yeah .
let's have some " teamsmanship .
ho !
one , two , three .
come on .
one , two , three .
attaboy .
attaboy .
here he is .
here he is .
come on .
you okay , ned?
you okay?
all right .
all right .
give him some room .
he's okay .
he just drank a little too much water .
how you shooting this , vikram?
wide open?
uh , light , 5 . 6 .
as always , even in the most challenging circumstances ... the members of team zissou find ways to keep morale high .
wait .
hold it .
is that a distress bark?
is something wounded out there?
we quickly locate the source of the mysterious cry .
what is she , steve?
a wild snow mongoose .
we thought they were extinct .
her ankle's broken .
ogata .
yeah?
run and get some hot milk and put these guys in the incubator .
we radio for the emergency transport of our rare , beautiful new friends .
that's what it used to be like .
had ned's heart stopped beating before you pulled him out of the water?
had ned's heart stopped beating ... before we pulled him out of the water?
yes .
but we got him started again pretty quickly .
don't go on this voyage right now , steve .
one of you's already dead , after all .
who?
oh , you mean esteban?
thanks for bringing that up .
who's gonna tell us the latin names of all the fishes and everything?
you know i can't remember all that shit .
please stop , eleanor .
eleanor , stop .
why are you leaving?
because i don't want to be part of whatever's gonna happen .
nobody knows what's going to happen .
and then we film it .
that's the whole concept .
that's how we've always done it .
i can't believe you took that boy's money .
he's an investor .
he's my sidekick .
the sugar crabs are back .
they're early this year .
i've never seen them mating before the solstice .
is that mating?
good bye , steve .
don't say that , even if it's true .
don't say that .
it's too painful .
what do you want me to say?
say bon voyage .
bon voyage .
kingsley " ned " zissou , 29 .
junior grade diving tech , executive producer .
energetic , spirited , youthful .
normally we would track the jaguar shark ... with a scanning monitor we keep on board the belafonte .
but its power tubes have seized up and blown a gasket .
we now proceed ... to an advanced system located on a colleague's offshore facility .
this will be team zissou's next stop .
see , renzo?
this is what i'm talking about .
a relationship subplot .
there's chemistry between us , you know .
huh?
here's a quote .
wait up .
who from?
zissou has an almost magical connection ...
to the life of the sea .
he speaks its language fluently .
i've never met a boy like that in all my life .
lord mandrake .
you should have opened with that one .
he was your mentor ...
hey , intern?
get me a campari , will ya?
on the rocks?
wanna go up in my balloon?
i like her hairdo .
me too .
but steve called her first .
i'm sorry i made you cry the other day .
oh , that's okay .
it's not completely your fault , anyway .
i'm going through some personal problems .
really?
what do you got?
well , i'm five months pregnant .
my editor's the father .
he's married .
but not to me .
wow .
that's a rough ticket .
you know , my first wife left me when i was your age .
what's " deep search "?
my submarine .
i had this exact image of you ... tacked up on the wall above my aquarium all through primary school .
oh , yeah?
you mean the official photograph , where i'm doing this?
that's the one .
mm hmm .
well , maybe it's just me , but i don't feel like that person .
i never did .
# here's to you nicola and bart #
# rest forever here in our hearts #
# the last and final moment is yours #
why did you abandon ned?
i didn't .
i never even met him .
what kind of piece are you writing , cubbie?
are you gonna screw us on this deal?
i hope not .
# here's to you nicola and bart #
you really think it's cool to hit the sauce when you've got a bun in the oven?
pel , bring us back down , please .
# is your triumph #
i don't have a problem with objective reporting .
what i have a problem with is some wombat ... coming on my boat trying to railroad me .
see if you can get one of these dolphins to swim under the hull ... and give us a look .
nah .
either they can't hear us , or they don't understand .
son of a bitch , i'm sick of these dolphins .
quiet out there tonight .
can you hear the jack whales singing?
beautiful .
i wonder what they're saying .
well , that was the sludge tanker over there , but ...
there you go .
that's them .
by the way , would you mind if i made a few modifications to the team zissou insignia?
i have some ideas ...
you mean the patch?
yes .
the insignia .
yeah .
it's probably kinda dated , isn't it?
sure .
take a crack at it .
make it a little trendier .
all right .
are you finding what you were looking for ... out here with me?
i hope so .
i wrote you a letter about 17 years ago .
you mean , like , a fan letter?
did i write you back?
i try to answer as many personally as i can .
dear ned plimpton ...
first , in answer to your question , always .
second , thank you very much for naming your bug after me .
my wife tells me it is actually a type of gnat .
you strike me as a very special boy and a key member of the zissou society .
i wish i could come visit you in kentucky and assist you with your work .
i remember your mother .
take care of yourself , ned plimpton .
you've served well .
your friend , capt. steve zissou .
dictated , but not read .
yeah , more or less standard boilerplate , i guess .
there's some real high tech gear ... inside this deal , believe me .
first we go downstairs and turn on that tracking system .
then , as long as the batteries on that homing dart haven't gone down ...
who locked us out?
no one .
we're trespassing .
steve , are we allowed in here?
it's a scientific community , man .
captain , i am required by law ... to notify the bank of any illegal activities .
just do what you've gotta do to cover your ass , bill .
i got it .
fuck !
they wired it !
klaus , go down and get me some cable snippers .
this is captain hennessey .
you have trespassed on a private facility .
the coast guard is being alerted via satellite .
again , this is captain hennessey .
immediately leave the prem ...
okay , action .
well , look who's back in town .
you've traveled over 150 miles since we last heard from you .
this son of a bitch is heading for the south pacific .
turn on your tape recorder , cubbie .
is it the jaguar shark?
on the record , yes .
cut .
print both takes , vikram .
was i ... just in the film?
yeah .
you're gonna have to sign a release .
but you've actually located the shark?
you'd better bet your fuckin 'ass we did .
all right , everybody , we got about 25 to 30 minutes ... before the coast guard gets here to arrest us .
i want you all to get hennessey's best gear onto the belafonte in 15 .
you're gonna steal his stuff?
nah , we'll get it back to him .
interns , let's see some hustle .
uh , what is this , pel?
i don't know .
uh , the map?
steve !
uh huh?
do you know that you just charted us on a course through unprotected waters?
yeah .
we're taking the shortcut .
but it's outside i. m. u. jurisdiction .
there isn't any protection .
i know , honey .
look at the map .
we go your way , that's about four inches .
we go my way , it's an inch and a half .
you wanna pay for the extra gas?
what kind of system is this?
it's the bernstein nines .
they just upgraded last summer .
the nines are out already?
does this do cappuccino?
ja .
wait a second .
steve , this isn't the procedure .
one of the interns just fell down the stairs with the main tracking processor .
just make sure we steal the backup .
are you listening to me?
eleanor told me that under no circumstances ...
shut up before you jinx us , anne marie .
you catching anything?
mm mmm .
hook this up and make me a latte .
you know , cubbie's kind of a sucker maker ... but she's got some moves .
i agree .
if she wasn't a bull dyke , i think i might have a bit of a thing for her .
as you can see ... if the creature continues its current migratory route ... our paths should converge in less than four days .
i wanna get there in three .
ogata , can we ...
vladimir , what's this blip right over here?
i don't know .
i've been trying to figure that out .
we might have them both mixed up , or it could be the other way around .
but we're gonna be right on top of it first thing in the morning .
hmm .
good eye , ned .
thank you .
should we investigate it?
yeah .
let's make a quick dive at 6 : 00 a .
m. , and we'll scope out the phantom signal .
it's probably just one of hennessey's research turtles .
yes .
but i wanna be back on the road by lunch .
do me a favor .
next time you get a hot idea in front of the reporter ... whisper it in my ear first .
otherwise i look like kind of a daydream johnny .
you know?
daydream johnny , yes .
you let him change your name?
well , we changed it together .
what was it before?
edward plimpton .
that's a million times better .
change it back , ned .
i really don't see you as a kingsley zissou .
do you think steve and i have a family resemblance?
no .
i guess it doesn't really matter anyway .
here .
i stole it back .
i strung it on some peppermint dental floss ... in case you wanna wear it like a necklace .
happy with the piece , jane?
what are you doing in here?
am i?
no .
put that down .
i assume i'm mr. z.
i'm sorry that you think my red hat is , uh ...
what's the word you use?
contrived .
and that ...
the zissou of my childhood represents all the dreams i've come to regret .
what?
why?
i'm going to have to start locking my f ing door .
it was locked .
i kicked it in .
why don't you just curse like other people?
because i'm trying to get out of the habit before i have my fucking baby !
okay .
that makes sense .
well , please clean up your room anyway .
it looks like a goddamn typhoon hit it .
get out !
please don't make fun of me .
i just wanted to flirt with you .
i'll have an intern come and fix the door .
this is a message from the i. m. u. coast guard .
apparently some crooked fuckers broke into my sea lab yesterday .
how awful .
did they nick anything?
it doesn't say .
they probably just trashed the place .
i'm so pissed i wanna spit .
hugo ...
tell carl to load my elephant gun ... with buckshot .
we're gonna hunt down these sickos .
supposedly cousteau and his cronies ... invented the idea of putting walkie talkies into the helmet .
but we made ours with a special rabbit ear on the top ... so we could pipe in some music .
let's start with the reverse .
okay , roll it , vikram .
would it be possible for me to address you as dad in this scene?
no .
why?
oh , excuse me .
i'm sorry .
i forgot .
i ...
i'm sorry .
where are you coming from , jack off?
shit .
it's not a bad impulse though .
some kind of nickname .
not that one .
it's too specific , but try to think of something else .
another name?
how about stevesy?
that's good .
try it .
what were you gonna say before?
good luck , stevesy .
fantastic .
let's go .
okay , action .
look , ned .
there's a sunken airplane down there .
let's check it out .
we examine the crash site , but are careful not to disturb the forensic evidence .
how was that?
not bad .
the first take was a little faster .
is that yours?
klaus .
klaus .
ja?
may i have a word with you , please?
what?
why'd you do that?
because i owed you one .
but you gave me a warning already .
you stood up for yourself .
i still owed you one .
and now i owe you one .
no .
now we're even .
why are you doing this?
he's not my father , you know .
i don't have that .
what are you talking about?
we're even , " damn it .
that's it !
no , it was like a beat up little jalopy .
i don't know what you'd call it .
you didn't see it?
i didn't see it , boss .
well , keep your eyes peeled .
klaus , check who's on watch .
i'll be in the sauna .
pel and ...
who the shit is kingsley zissou?
is that him?
mm hmm .
that's him .
i've never felt a baby in someone's stomach before .
i think you'll make a very good single mother .
thanks .
although it does put you both at a tremendous disadvantage .
you know ...
steve's got a little bit of a thing for you .
why do you say that?
because he told me .
really?
i thought he hated my guts .
well , i think you hurt his feelings , but that doesn't mean ...
he says i hurt his feelings?
so ... f d up .
# five , four #
# three , two #
yeah?
steve , would you please open the door?
mm hmm?
jane , is , uh , ned in there?
stevesy?
stevesy , what's happenin '?
are those hijackers?
well , we call them pirates out here , ned .
you were supposed to be on watch , by the way .
oh , my god .
you're right .
stevesy , look .
whoa .
no .
so , tell me , you were reading to each other in french?
no , it's in english .
it was translated .
well , you know , you're not supposed to go into each other's cabins on a boat .
why not?
it's just kind of ... an unwritten maritime rule when you're at sea .
especially the goddamn lookout .
i'm so sorry .
so am i.
you hung us out to dry .
if we don't handle this right ... we're gonna all get murdered .
including her unborn british child .
i'm gonna kill you for that , asshole !
i'm gonna hit you so fuckin 'hard you'll be blind !
please don't hurt him .
watch me .
i'll let you know when i'm gonna make a move .
steve , it's way safer for us to just do what they say .
they probably just want our money and jewels and shit .
yeah .
then how am i gonna finish my movie then?
jesus holy f ...
they're going to kill us , steve .
all right .
i'm pattin 'you on the back right now , klausie .
don't be scared .
i'm gonna get us through this , everybody .
ogata , cmo est , pal?
wake up , ned o .
i'm sorry i yelled at you .
