of course it's the chemicai process .
weil .
weil , you have some iate memories?
why'd i have these memories?
brother , i don't know .
but there's some questions you should be asking yourself .
now , the question you should be asking yourself first , why did you give our pai that money?
90 miilion doilars .
nobody ... in three years .
okay , forget about it .
think backward .
they told me that i was working ... by someone named decker .
decker?
yeah .
wiiliam decker?
i think so .
what i heard was he was working on something ievei 5 ... shut him down .
what was it? ... a iaser .
what reason?
90 miilion doilars just ...
what?
it's no way i get escaped from the room without the cigarettes and the glasses .
i'd never have got another bus without the bus ticket , and ... ... if i don't have the diamond ring ,
i won't foilow the kid to the ...
right .
i gave aii that money ... ... just to make sure i'd pay attention to these items .
why?
because i'd know ... to ... 5 hunfred biilion doilars ... the future .
machine 303 was ...
... virus?
no , it's not a kind of virus .
wait , i'ii show you .
it's not in the software ,
it's in the hardware .
there got a circuit somewhere here ...
but you can find it , right?
yeah , i can .
then do it .
we change plan ... we don't need michaei jennings anymore .
look , if we know anything we know the time travels is not possible .
einstein proved that .
why?
time travels , yes .
but einstein is very clear that he belives time ...
mic , mic , come on .
may be we should just find decker .
i can't talk to decker .
why not?
an accident .
an accident?
yeah , he feii from the bedroom window .
he feii from the bedroom window .
sure , it can happen .
oh , we got to get ourselves ...
listen to me , i think what happened was i ... i saw my future .
but i saw i need to change it .
... each either might be using specific time ... ... specific places i mean , ...
i don't want to be dead .
what?
the've seen you , mic .
flee !
listen to me , take this , ... into the door , ... you understand?
go !
go on !
shit !

where's your gun?
he's got it .
so , how are you , michael?
you?
why?
don't remember?
you brought this on yourself , mic .
so , how is it feei knowing you're going to die?
so you're saying he has designed to escape?
we've no explaination .
because we've to iook at aii these evidences , ... ... hard to accept the conclusion that he has seemed to be predictable what's going to happen on him .
his memories extracted ... before he fled , they don't seem to end up to anything .
we knew decker's trying to design something ... ... but when he sold his plan , it's only half way done .
i don't understand .
decker's working at ... on iaser and iens plans
he claimed the iens was powerfui and up to see around the ... of the universe .
decker believed that he can see around the curve that round up forever ... ... you're on the back way where you started it .
look it on yourself .
excepting i iooking back on yourself now .
you're not .
no , you're iooking at the future .
can you imagine what'ii happen to jenngings , figure out what is done and try to prohibit from it ...
jenngings won't do that .
i'ii stiil ... he never iies ...
when he heard he was being accused up ...
he was hurt and scared .
why don't you bring him here and i'ii give him a ...
but the first thing is to find hin first .
do you think he reaily saw the future?
my name is michaei jennings and i can't remember ... ... i made a reservation recently .
