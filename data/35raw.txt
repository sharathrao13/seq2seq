look at that !
i've never seen anything like that in my life !
that's incredible !
that's terrific .
specifically , you're bargaining for the right to stay in a horrible social spectacle .
it has its purposes .
you've served those purposes brilliantly .
why argue when you can quit?
and you say you want to know why decisions are made .
your future comfort is assured .
you don't need to know .
why argue about decisions you're not powerful enough to make for yourself?
energy will treat you well , you know that .
if the rule changes stay , mr bartholomew , i'm playin 'with my team .
too late .
the rule change is scheduled and announced .
there's no going back .
you've seen to that .
i'll see you in tokyo .
you can be made to quit !
you can be forced !
you can't make me quit !
don't tell me i can't .
don't ever say that !
i can !
you can be stopped !
you could have killed someone !
it's all goin 'too fast .
i'm not packed ...
you're not going , daph .
those bags are ready .
here .
take this extra hat .
sir , i've had a call .
i have to go over to energy .
you can't go to tokyo?
what do you mean , i'm not going?
i hope this isn't an inconvenience .
no , no , it's no problem .
i'm supposed to go with you .
well , what's that mean?
who told you you're supposed to go with me?
nobody told me .
listen , jonathan , i really wanna go with you .
i do really .
you'll need me .
get yourself another assignment , will you , daph?
everybody's an assignment .
life's an assignment .
you better do as you're told , jonathan .
that's all i have to say .
are you threatenin 'me?
don't be here when i come back .
you won't be back , johnny boy ...
don't try to frighten me , daphne , you don't know how .
you go tell them people that i'm going to tokyo and you're not , huh?
you tell 'em that .
ciao !
keller .
make sure my gear gets to the track in tokyo .
i'm gonna travel with the team this trip .
you call transportation and tell 'em .
yes , sir .
what chance does houston have of defeating tokyo tonight?
both teams have fine players and different styles .
what do you say , moonpie?
it's not an even match , see , because the tokyo team has all these little short guys !
what about the rule changes?
well , at houston , we kinda play a wide open system .
will you comment on a game where the rules are always changing?
the game's always had rule changes .
they don't affect good teams .
you're a great new player .
what's the secret of your success?
oh , it's no secret .
i just imitate him and plastic surgery keeps me beautiful .
there are rumours that the last game of the season will be without time limits .
any comments?
i don't think it will .
it's still a game .
there are also other rumours .
some say you retired from the game .
here i am .
corporate society was an inevitable destiny , a material dream world .
everything man touched became attainable .
i've been touched all my life , one way or the other .
either caressed or hit .
don't much seem to matter which any more .
i guess that's why i wanna see ella again .
to see if i still feel things now .
you know what i mean?
yeah ...
there are some other things , too .
they took ella away from me .
now they're tryin 'to push me out .
i'd sure like to find out why .
i think i'll go to one of them computer centres .
see what i can find out .
findin 'out things , that's ...
that's the thing , moonpie .
welcome to tokyo and tonight's dramatic semifinal match for the world's rollerball championship between hosts tokyo and houston .

and tokyo takes a 1 0 lead over houston .

houston being pressured by the faster tokyo team .
the second ball is fired .
spread out !
slow 'em down !
spread out !

blue !
this way , please .
may i say first , please , that you played a superb game in our city .
thank you .
a simple problem , yet i know it is difficult for you .
your team mate has no family and permission is required now before consummating matters .
so , he's technically dead?
yes , unfortunately .
his heart and lungs will function , but his brain is ...
it has expired .
from the first minutes , it was hopeless .
i believe this was explained to you .
he's warm .
yes .
but if you will , please , you must sign a release form .
it is required .
does he ...
does he dream?
no , there is no brain wave at all , no sort of consciousness .
just a deep coma , a vegetable .
no dreams , nothing .
but even a plant feels somethin '.
who can say?
please .
it senses life .
i mean , it turns towards the sun .
it's alive , isn't it?
you must sign .
you ...
you just leave him the way he is .
just leave him as he is .
you must sign .
there's no other way .
arrangements will be made .
please !
there are hospital rules that ...
no , there aren't .
there aren't any rules at all .
let me know if you have any problems .
you won't find any answers in geneva .
take care of your arm .
in my opinion we are confronted here with something of a situation .
otherwise i would not have presumed to take up your time .
once again it concerns the case of jonathan e.
we don't want anything extraordinary to happen to jonathan .
we've already agreed on that .
no accidents , nothing unnatural .
the game was created to demonstrate the futility of individual effort .
let the game do its work .
the energy corporation has done all it can .
if a champion defeats the meaning for which the game was designed , then he must lose .
i hope you agree with my reasoning .
thank you all .
will you follow me , please?
hello !
hello !
yes , it is !
the famous jonathan e. hard to believe !
sorry things are in a mess .
the rollerball champion .
wonderful !
not many people come to see us , you know .
we're not easy to talk to , zero and i.
we're a little confused again here today .
this is embarrassing .
it's embarrassing to misplace things .
you've misplaced some data?
mm , the whole of the 13 th century .
misplaced the computers several conventional computers .
we can't find them .
we're always moving things around , getting organised , my assistants and i.
but this is zero's fault .
zero , he's the world's file cabinet .
pity .
poor old 13 th century .
well , come along now .
you want to get started , don't you?
yes , sir .
this way .
now ...
we've lost those computers with all of the 13 th century in them .
not much in the century just dante and a few corrupt popes .
but it's so distracting and annoying .
you've unlimited restrictions here , of course , but you'll have to come so , so many times .
it all takes such effort .
do the executives still come here?
oh , they used to , some of them .
what about the books?
books , books?
they're all changed .
all transcribed .
all information is here .
we've zero , of course .
he's the central brain , the world's brain .
fluid mechanics , fluidics .
he's liquid , you see .
his waters touch all knowledge .
everything we ask has become so complicated now .
each thing we ask ...
this morning we wanted to know about the 13 th century .
he flows out into all our storage systems .
he considers everything .
he's become so ambiguous now , as if he knows nothing at all .
could you tell me about the corporate wars?
wars , wars?
oh , yes , of course , we have them all here .
punic war , prussian war , peloponnesian war .
crimean war , wars of the roses .
one doesn't recall them in sequence , but corporate wars ...
well , zero will or can , i'm sure , tell you anything .
a memory pool , you see .
he's supposed to tell us where things are and what they might possibly mean .
look , zero .
a visitor .
jonathan e , the rollerball champion .
you've filed away a lot of data on him .
do you remember?
does it answer you?
oh , yes , it speaks .
it finds things and loses them and confuses itself .
ask anything , he'll find it for you , section and lot .
won't you , zero?
all right .
i'd like ...
i'd like some information about corporate decisions .
how they're made and who makes them .
zero , you heard the question .
answer him .
negative .
you don't have to give him a full political briefing .
answer .
negative .
this is jonathan e.
he has to know .
make it simple .
answer .
corporate decisions are made by corporate executives .
corporate executives make ...
i know we have the answers .
knowledge converts to power .
energy equals genius .
power is knowledge .
i don't want to bully you .
genius is energy .
corporate entities control elements ...
but you have to answer ! ... of economic life , technology , capital ,
labour and markets .
corporate decisions are made by ...
you have to , zero ! ... corporate executives .
the 13th century ...
negative , negative , negative ...
it's so embarrassing !
hello , johnny .
how are you , ella?
nervous .
how are you?
i'm all right , i guess .
what are you doin '?
looking at you .
counting your scars .
seeing how you've changed .
oh , you mean that's how i've changed?
just a little more beat up .
oh , no !
you're just not ...
yeah , well ...
come on .
you want a drink or somethin '?
no , thank you .
you have a lovely place .
thank you .
well , i've seen your house .
you have?
yeah .
when we played in rome , i stood a block away and watched your front gate for a couple of hours .
i was just standin 'there wonderin 'what your furniture was like , what you said to each other in the mornings .
what's he like?
what's he do , this ...?
he's a city engineer .
we have a jet copter , a son , two cats and a place in the alps .
you don't really want to hear all of this .
a son , huh?
yes .
we have a lot of friends .
and he has a lover .
we have furniture a lot like yours .
same taste in furniture .
how about that?
you know , johnny , all they want is a kind of incidental control over just a part of our lives .
they have control economically and politically , but they also provide .
provide , huh?
they were responsible for takin 'you away and i started to hate 'em .
but they weren't .
it was the game , johnny .
i mean , it was so important to you .
it was as if i wasn't even there .
the play , there was nothing else .
i'm sorry .
you know i wanted you here .
well , i mean ...
this might sound all wrong , but ...
well , i was just tryin 'to remember myself then .
yeah .
maybe it was love i wanted to try to remember .
there's a lot of things i wanna talk to you about .
yeah .
i've been thinkin ', ella .
thinkin 'a lot .
i've been watching .
it's like people had a choice a long time ago between ... well , having all them nice things or freedom .
of course , they chose comfort .
but comfort is freedom .
it always has been .
the history of civilisation is the struggle against poverty .
no !
no , that's not it .
that's never been it .
i mean , them privileges just buy us off .
look ...
they want me to quit , ella .
then quit .
just like that , huh?
but you've got to do it now .
you've got to before it's too late , whether you want to or not .
look , johnny ...
the next game , there won't be any substitutions allowed .
and no time limit .
you'll die , johnny .
everybody will die .
no time limit .
they tell you that?
yes .
they tell you to convince me to quit?
yes , but that isn't why i came here .
you have to get out for your own sake .
please , johnny , please .
did they tell you to stay if i did quit?
are you my big reward?
you still don't understand why i came here .
you're the only person i ever wanted .
i wanted you on my side , that's all .
it's like you're a god now .
maybe you know what i don't .
i've been so stupid for so long .
i've been so stubborn .
i don't even know why .
it scares me .
i know i'm probably gonna ...
i'm probably gonna die .
and you'll be in there pumpin 'away long after i'm gone .
hey , you ...
you got it made , old buddy .
bluebonnets and everything .
jonathan's dead !
jonathan's dead !
jonathan's dead !
jonathan's dead !
attention .
your attention , please .
rule changes for tonight's world championship game .
no substitutions , no penalties and no time limit !
watch now , he's got the ball .
next time around we defend .
come on !
come on , get outta there !
get him up .
he did it !
get him in the elevator .
get off the rail !
get him off the track !
i don't want another man on that track !
houston , what the hell are you doing?
ain't nobody gonna win this game !
