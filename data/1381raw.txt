cracking job , gromit .
hang on , old chum .
what's going on?
who is it?
reel him in , lad .
to me .
to me .
gotcha !
thieving monster .
me prize pumpkin .
me little baby .
me pride and joy .
you've saved it , anti pesto .
it was nothing at all , mrs ...
everything's under control .
oh , no !
don't worry , madam .
thank you , mr. wallace .
all in a night's work , mrs. mulch .
cute little feller , isn't he?
you'd never believe they'd cause so much damage .
oh , he may look innocent , sir .
but left to his own devices , this is the ultimate vegetable destroying machine .
reg , me teeth !
job well done , lad .
subject disarmed and neutralized .
bless you , anti pesto .
with you out there protecting our veg , the most important event of the year is safe .
aye .
and i hope they give them pests what's coming to 'em , and all .
amen to that , mrs. mulch .
it was a long , hard night last night , gromit .
i'll need a good , hearty breakfast under me belt .
pile it up , lad .
i'm in the mood for food !
gromit , old pal .
it's happened again .
i'll need assistance .
well , thanks , chuck .
i'm sure that hole's getting smaller .
another successful night .
how are the inmates?
must be getting a bit full down there .
talking of which .
now , for a great big plate of ... ... vegetables .
still got me on the diet , eh , gromit?
watching me shape?
there's a good dog .
gromit , lad?
how is that prize melon of yours coming on?
must be a while since you measured it .
lovely food .
for rabbits , that is .
as for me , i need something a bit more cheesy .
caught red handed , eh , lad?
i'm sorry , gromit .
i know you're doing this for my own good , but the fact is i'm just crackers about cheese .
look , if i must change me ways , at least let me do it my way .
with technology .
it's time we tried my latest invention , the mind manipulation omatic .
it extracts unwanted thoughts and desires .
i haven't tested it yet , but it should be perfectly safe .
just a bit of harmless brain alteration , that's all .
anti pesto humane pest control .
how might we be of assistance?
yes .
lady tottington here of tottington hall .
your ladyship .
this is an honor .
it's a disaster .
i have the most terrible rabbit problem .
the competition's only days away .
you simply have to do something .
certainly , ma'am .
i think we're about to go up in the world , lad .
just stay right where you are , your ladyship , and we'll be with you in an ...
in an hour?
i can't wait an hour .
i have a major infestation .
hello?
hello?
that's more like it .
thank goodness you've ...
what ho !
for you , my love .
victor .
how lovely and ... unexpected .
heard you had a spot of rabbit bother and toodled on over to sort the blighters out .
gosh , that's awfully sweet of you .
but you really needn't bother .
it's no bother , little boo boo .
it's the least a chap can do for his filly .
don't want pests spoiling our beautiful manor house , do we?
our " manor house?
no one's mentioned marriage , victor .
all in good time , my dear .
vermin first , though , what what .
come on , phillip .
victor !
we can deal with this humanely .
very classy .
just the sort of client we should be dealing with , eh , lad?
burrowing bounders !
they must be breeding like ... ... well , rabbits .
only one thing for it , lad .
victor , hadn't we agreed?
no more thoughtless killing .
quite right , my dear .
so i've thought this one through very carefully .
it's off to bunny heaven for you , big ears .
victor !
no !
what the ...?
champion sucker , eh , gromit?
the bunvac 6000 .
this'll impress her ladyship .
i don't understand .
it should have been a bull's eye .
oh , victor .
i felt we'd made a real breakthrough with this hunting obsession of yours .
i really thought you'd changed .
i'm sorry , campanula , but i am what i am .
there's no nonsense with victor quartermaine .
what you see is what you get .
what the ...?
sounds like a really big brute , this one .
give it some more welly .
gosh !
maybe i should've used a bigger nozzle .
anti pesto , you're here .
your ladyship .
my darlings !
you're safe .
my word !
what a fabulous job you've done .
and not a single one harmed .
the old bv6000 , ma'am .
capable of 1 25 rpm .
that's rabbits per minute .
how inspired !
mr ...?
oh , wallace .
mr. wallace .
is this all of them?
just one left .
hoist her up , gromit .
victor , stop fooling around in the dirt and have a look at this .
the ingenious anti pesto have completely dealt with my rabbit problem .
lsn't it marvelous?
marvelous?
marvelous?
this confounded contraption virtually suffocated me !
besides , the job's only half done .
how do you intend to finish these vermin off?
crush 'em?
liquidize 'em?
they're humane .
humane?
well , then perhaps they'd be humane enough to give me back my dignity .
i want ...
toupee , please .
oh , grand .
we take check or cash .
toupee , you idiot !
my hair is in your machine .
oh , no , it's only rabbits in there .
the hare , i think you'll find , is a much larger mammal .
out of my way , fool .
i'm sorry , my dear , but i refuse to suffer any further humiliation at the hands of these blundering nitwits .
i therefore bid you good day .
thank you for ridding me of a real problem , mr. wallace .
tell me , what exactly will you do with all these rabbits?
trade secret .
yes .
i'd be happy to let them roam free if it wasn't for the competition .
but they do so love their veg .
it's in their little bunny natures , and you can't change that , can you?
no .
or can you?
why didn't we think of it before , lad?
the solution to all our storage problems .
simply by connecting the bunvac to the mind manipulation omatic , we can brainwash the bunnies .
rabbit rehabilitation .
once cured of their antisocial veg ravaging behavior , the rabbits can be safely released without fear of re offending .
just a little added lunar power to enhance the mind waves ...
... and we can begin .
veg , bad .
veg , bad .
veg , bad .
say no to carrots , cabbage and cauliflower .
well , come on , lad , what are you waiting for?
turn on the bunvac .
full suction .
it's working , gromit .
it's working !
their tiny bunny brains are being saturated in my veg free mind waves .
another 30 minutes brainwashing should suffice .
then we can move on to the conditioning .
gromit !
switch it off !
get it off !
get it off me , lad !
oh , thanks , lad .
quick .
give us a carrot .
it worked , gromit !
a reformed rabbit .
we'll call him hutch .
shall we?
come on .
let's get the kettle on .
we'll see to him in the morning .
i feel we're on the cusp of a real breakthrough , lad .
mankind freed from rabbit problems forever .
lady tottington will be impressed .
good night .
sleep tight .
and don't let the bed bugs bite .
good night , gromit .
sweet dreams , old chum .
protect and nourish the frail and the weak , o lord .
protect and nourish the frail and the weak , o lord .
let them grow big and strong under thy loving care .
in fact , let them grow bigger and stronger than anyone else's , so that the first prize might be mine .
amen .
the harvest offering to bind the deal .
we plow the fields and scatter the good seed on ...
he sends the snow in winter ...
all good gifts around us
are sent from ...
heavens above .
hello?
hello?
is anybody there?
mrs. mulch?
please , come forward , whoever you are .
there's no need to be afraid .
you're hungry .
then please , take what you like .
it is for the needy , after all .
no !
no !
no !
no !
mercy !
morning , gromit .
a pest free night per ... chance?
lummy day .
it's a disaster .
me garden's ruined .
it's a disaster .
me garden's ruined .
it's carnage out there .
where were anti pesto?
simmer down .
simmer down , now .
right .
one at a time , if ya please .
we pay good money for our crop protection .
if ya can't deliver the goods , maybe you should keep your traps shut .
i never saw such cauliflower carnage .
worse than the great slug blight of '32 , when there were slugs the size of pigs .
growbag's right .
the slugs are back !
the slugs are back !
that's enough !
that's enough !
look , this flippin 'vegetable competition
causes nothin 'but trouble every year .
here we go .
if ya ask me ...
get on with ya !
know what?
i'll tell ya .
if ya ask me , this was arson .
arson?
aye !
someone arsin 'around .
that's right .
one of you lot .
a man .
this was no man .
what are you saying?
does a man have teeth the size of axe blades?
or ears like terrible tombstones?
by tampering with nature , forcing vegetables to swell far beyond their natural size , we have brought a terrible judgment upon ourselves .
hey !
give over !
you're mental .
and for our sins , a hideous creature has been sent to punish us all !
repent !
repent !
lest you too , taste the wrath of ... ... the were rabbit !
this is terrible !
what's going to happen to us?
doomed !
who's going to help us?
what's to become of the show?
we live for that competition .
get off me .
we're simple folk .
it's all we have .
who will save us?
get ...
hey !
a were rabbit?
oh , come , come , now .
i do believe the vicar's been to the communion wine again .
what we are dealing with here is no supernatural rabbit .
it's a big fellow , perhaps .
but a mortal creature of flesh and blood .
a matter easily dealt with by a hunter .
guns will not be necessary , thank you , victor .
hasn't there been enough destruction?
i believe the killing of fluffy creatures is never justified .
i say we give anti pesto a second chance .
what?
how on earth would those tiny minded buffoons ever catch such a big rabbit?
mr. wallace?
well ...
with a big trap .
by jove .
he's ...
he's got it !
genius !
genius !
brilliant .
what a great idea !
clever .
you see , victor , there's hope for the vegetables yet .
not the ones i'm looking at .
that's me boys !
love , gromit .
that's the biggest trap of all .
the " tender trap , " they call it .
and that's what we'll use to catch this thing .
yes , lad , a lovely lady rabbit .
how could any hot blooded rabbit beast resist?
oh , come on , gromit .
a bit more , you know , alluring .
very cheeky .
that's more like it , lad .
how can we possibly fail now?
you're a total knockout .
stick around , lad .
should fix back on quite easily .
nighty night , me lovelies .
think big now .
no !
don't worry .
no .
no .
well , i'm very sorry , mrs. mulch .
we'll get there as soon as we can .
mr. dibber .
oh , yes .
can i call you back?
mrs. girdling .
a tunnel you say?
what do you intend to do about this?
i'll look into it .
so where did you get to , lad?
i thought i told you to stay put .
it's gone mad around here .
i thought we were supposed to be a team .
how are we ever gonna catch this thing if you go gallivanting off on your own all the time?
you're doing it again !
where are you going now?
gromit !
grommy !
really , lad .
you do realize i've made a personal promise to lady tottington .
how is this sort of behavior going to get us any nearer to finding a rabbit mon ... ster?
hutch .
oh , gromit .
we've created a monster .
hutch is the beast .
the lunar panels .
they must've over stimulated hutch's primitive bunny nature .
and now , when the moon appears , he undergoes a hideous transformation .
oh , gromit .
this is absolutely ... ... fantastic !
don't you see , lad?
ok , so we've created a veg ravaging rabbit monster .
but we've also captured it .
just like i promised lady tottington .
i'll go and tell her the good news .
make sure he doesn't escape .
bye !
mr. wallace .
it's the beast , your ladyship .
i bring great news .
gosh , how exciting .
please , do come in .
well , this is simply spiffing news .
with the beast in captivity , the competition can go ahead as planned .
you saved the day , mr. wallace .
it was nothing , your ladyship .
so modest .
oh , please , do help yourself .
thanks .
i so appreciate you coming all this way to let me know , wallace .
tell me , are you a vegetable lover yourself?
they're ... growing on me .
then come with me .
there's something very special i want to show you .
hop in .
it's very snug .
it's my jacob's ladder .
and it goes all the way to heaven .
welcome to my inner sanctum , wallace .
my secret garden .
it's a veritable vegetable paradise .
i just knew you'd love it .
unlike victor .
he's never shown any interest in my produce .
his loss , lady tottington .
please , wallace .
call me totty .
if anything were to happen to my vegetables ,
i don't know what i'd do .
i'm sure you understand , mr. wallace .
i can see that you're a true nature lover .
oh , yes .
yes , i am .
at first , i thought i could change victor .
now i'm not so sure .
do you think a man can change , wallace?
change?
oh , yes .
really , phillip .
the things one does for love .
pesto .
mr. wallace .
oh , totty .
totty?
i'd like to show you one last thing .
something no other man has ever seen .
my carrot de chantenay .
just smell it , wallace .
feel its silken flesh .
oh , yes .
isn't it the most sumptuous , succulent specimen you've ever seen?
yes !
doesn't it fill your heart
with desire?
yes !
just imagine what it would taste like .
what on earth were you thinkin 'of , lad?
ruined a perfectly good piece of fashionable knitwear , that did .
to say nothing of a relationship with an important client .
it's lucky for us her ladyship was so understanding .
honestly , i don't know what's got into you lately .
and slow down for pity's sake .
you'll buckle me trunnions .
don't worry .
i'll see to this .
you stay here where you belong .
in the doghouse .
right .
it's heavier than it looks .
i know your little secret , pesto .
i know exactly what's going on .
your lordship ...
yes .
you think you can pilfer my filly , don't you?
you think you can con a woman out of her fortune?
who , me?
well , i got here first !
i've spent a long time reeling in that fluffy headed bunny lover .
and i'm not about to let some puddle headed peasant poach her from me .
comprenez?
right o .
i'll be off then .
ta ta .
you're not going anywhere , pesto .
not until i've taught you a jolly good lesson .
come on !
queensberry rules !
put 'em up , ya little pipsqueak .
you're shaking .
don't tell me you're a scaredy cat as well as a scoundrel .
and don't think acting like a big girl's blouse will get you out of it .
there's no mercy with victor quartermaine .
what the dickens?
what on earth ...?
phillip !
attack !
attack !
what the ...?
vicar !
vicar !
oh , where the devil is he?
do you want to confess?
i want to talk to you about ... ... the beast .
everything you need to know is in this book .
" nun wrestling .
no .
i meant this one .
here .
here it is .
the hideous monster plaguing our parish .
the were rabbit .
so it's true .
the beast lurks within all of us , my child .
the side that emerges at night as the moon rises into the sky .
the side that savagely rips the leaves off any innocent cabbage .
spare me the sermon , vicar .
just tell me how i kill him .
i mean " it .
to kill such a creature would require nerves of steel and ... ... a bullet .
a bullet?
a bullet .
a bull ...
what kind of bullet?
a bullet of pure gold .
gold .
yes .
twenty four karat .
get out of my way .
silly old fool .
beware !
beware of the beast within !
perfect re entry , gromit .
this veg diet's doing the trick , eh , lad?
i feel smashing .
so how's our rabbit monster?
hope you're keeping an eye on him .
what's up , dog?
well , fancy that .
rabbit ears .
that is a bit odd .
and what are you tryin 'to say , lad?
what?
what?
what?
you think that i'm the ...?
because of these?
oh , no .
no .
this is just a reaction to that healthy veg diet you've got me on .
it's the toxins coming out .
silly old pooch .
thinking i'm the beast .
next thing you'll be saying is that hutch is turning into me .
hey .
what are you doing , lad?
have you gone completely mad?
cheese !
cheese?
i do like a bit of gorgonzola .
oh , dear .
perfect .
ma'am .
now , let's see .
coming through !
the tombola's arrived .
and the bouncy tottington hall .
splendid .
it's going to be such a jolly competition tonight .
i just know it .
ya don't know nothin '.
what?
the beast has struck again .
that's what .
that's right !
no , you're quite mistaken , mrs. mulch .
the beast is in captivity .
oh , yeah?
then just take a look at my wife's brassicas .
ravaged in the night .
but i don't understand .
anti pesto told me ...
a pack of lies !
it's not safe to bring our vegetables here .
the show's off .
but this is simply dreadful news .
the tottingtons have held a giant vegetable competition on this very night for over 500 years .
that's right .
not even the great duck plague of '53 stopped it .
if only there were another way .
what ho !
it's quartermaine .
heard you had a spot of rabbit bother .
didn't this bit used to ...?
now .
now , let's see .
where does this part go?
oh , it's hopeless .
i'll never fix this flippin 'machine .
me mind's just a rabbit y mush .
oh , gromit .
i don't wanna be a giant rabbit !
the bounce is gone from his bungee .
hey , presto !
rabbit rehabilitation .
but if i can't fix it ...
cheddar . ... maybe the other me can !
i'm inventing , mostly .
look at me go !
i'm a genius .
awake !
i can't answer the door .
not like this .
charming .
i'm wallace .
i already am !
hutch !
geronimo !
wallace?
hang on a mo '.
wallace?
hello?
i say .
open this door at once .
totty .
lady tottington , if you don't mind .
i'm afraid i have some rather bad news , wallace .
thing is , well , you've rather let me down with this beastly beast business .
i suppose i have .
yes .
it's obvious to me that you have absolutely no idea where this poor creature is .
and i'm afraid you've given me no option but to let victor shoot the poor thing .
shoot it?
yes .
wasn't an easy choice , but the veg competition has to come first .
besides , victor's promised me it won't suffer .
it will be quick and painless .
how thoughtful .
i cannot deny it was a difficult decision for me .
because i've recently developed ...
hurry ! ... feelings for you .
feelings?
oh , well , never mind , eh?
ta ra , then .
wait !
wallace .
i haven't finished .
there's more that needs to be said .
well , i'll give you a tinkle , shall l?
can't we at least shake hands?
part as friends?
it's not very convenient at the moment .
thanks for coming by .
well , i ...
i ...
that's right , my lovely .
you can say goodbye to your fluffy lover boy .
you gotta help me , gromit !
hide me .
anything .
before it's too late !
lad !
your lordship .
good night , gromit .
'tis done .
my poor sensitive child .
allow us all to share in your moment of sorrow .
yeah !
on with the show !
what the ...?
why you ...
of course .
the vegetable competition .
your loyalty is moving .
sadly , you won't be .
come along , phillip .
everyone's been looking forward to a good show .
let's see they get one .
hooray !
mr. growbag .
i ...
i have a hunch this'll be a night to remember .
i just have a hunch .
all right .
all right .
if we must do this flipping veg show ,
iet's do it in an orderly and law abiding fashion .
cucumbers , give way to melons .
carrots , wait your turn !
aubergines ...
there's our bait , phillip .
all we have to do now is wait for our fluffy friend to appear .
look over here , everyone !
it's victor !
he's here !
our hero .
please , sir , kiss my baby .
another time , perhaps .
kiss my potato .
not now .
kiss my artichoke .
look , just ...
victor .
campanula !
victor , i have to know .
did it suffer?
of course not , my dear .
not yet , anyway .
victor?
oy , you .
constable .
careful with them capsicums .
listen , i don't want to cause panic , but the beast isn't actually dead yet .
the beast isn't actually dead yet?
what?
oops .
to the competition stand !
cracking toast , gromit .
i'm just crackers about cheese .
monterey jack .
smashing wensleydale .
job well done , lad .
quiet !
quiet !
now , listen carefully .
i've only got two ...
i've only got one gold bullet left .
so leave this to me .
yes , all right , i admit the beast is still at large .
but the good news is your prize vegetables are the perfect bait ...
bait? ... and will draw the creature like a magnet .
keep still .
my baby .
there , there , love .
it'll be all ...
don't even move a muscle .
mrs. mulch !
no !
it's not getting my baby !
lovely food .
for rabbits , that is .
come back !
come back !
yes .
right on cue .
come back !
go away !
that's right .
come to uncle victor .
it's coming for us !
bingo .
what the ...?
hurrah for anti pesto !
it's getting away !
get off , you stupid ...
no !
vicar , i need more gold bullets .
they don't come cheap , you know .
victor?
what are you doing?
i need it , my sweet .
emergency .
victor , no !
please !
come , now , campanula , let go .
but it's my golden carrot award .
this is hardly the time , my darling .
give it to me this instant !
but victor !
cheese , gromit .
the golden carrot belongs in the show !
no , the golden carrot belongs in the were rabbit .
every man for himself !
help !
help !
help me !
put me down at once , you great big hairy thing , you !
stop !
stop !
mob supplies !
get your angry mob supplies here .
put her down , you great ugly brute !
i'll bagsy the lucky rabbit's foot .
help me , someone !
help me !
yes .
no .
no , no , no !
put me down !
put me down , you ...
whatever you are !
help !
what is it?
what are you staring at with those beastly eyes?
wallace .
oh , wallace .
what ever have you done to yourself?
well , don't you worry .
i'll protect you .
get your hairy mitts off my future wife , you big brute .
no !
victor !
you don't understand .
the hunt is off .
it's ...
we made a terrible mistake .
no .
you commissioned me to rid you of pesto , and that's just what i intend to do .
pesto?
why , you knew it was wallace all along .
oh , all right .
so what if it is that blithering idiot .
no one will ever believe you .
and if i can't have your money , i can still bag your bunny .
my eyes !
run , rabbit , run !
i rather like your hair pinned back .
no , victor , no !
stop !
please !
victor !
you can hop , but you can't hide , pesto .
beware the moon !
stupid interfering mutt .
stand back !
there may be a large rabbit dropping !
looks like the buck stops here .
eat karat , bunny boy !
potty poo !
no one beats victor quartermaine !
is that so?
consider yourself dumped .
he's in there !
there he is !
surround him !
there he is !
over there !
phillip , help me !
phillip !
do something .
destroy !
drive out the monstrosity !
well , let's see how he likes it .
wallace?
oh , gromit .
well , at least now he's at peace .
the rabbit's gone .
if only there were a way to bring back wallace .
lovely cheese , gromit .
gromit?
don't forget the crackers .
cheese?
cheese !
it's me again .
i'm back !
gromit !
you clever mutt .
well done , old pal !
totty !
wallace !
you're ...
thanks , lad .
oh , look !
well , i think you deserve this , gromit .
for a brave and splendid melon .
we've all got a lot to thank you for .
every dog has his day .
and thank you , wallace .
you've saved me from a terrible marriage .
all the same , it is going to be rather lonely at tottington hall now .
unless ...
i have a little proposal for you , wallace .
i'm so thrilled you agreed to go through with this .
my pleasure , totty .
one for the album , gromit .
i declare this bunny sanctuary officially open .
when you're ready , lad .
fire up the old bv6000 .
oh , it's simply marvelous .
my home , a safe haven for all things fluffy .
i do hope you'll still come visit , wallace .
i'd rather got used to having you around .
there'll always be a part of me here at tottington hall .
give it some more welly , lad .
cheese !
