between the years when the oceans drank atlantis ... and the rise of the sons of arius , there was an age undreamed of , when shining kingdoms lay spread across the world .
hither came conan , the cimmerian , sword in hand .
it is i , his chronicler , who knows well his saga .
now let me tell you of the days of high adventure .
i think we made the merchant angry !
are you surprised?
but we didn't steal everything he had .
we didn't have time .
hyah !
hyah !
hyah !
hyah !
why aren't they trying to kill us?
maybe they want to capture us , then torture us to death .
oh .
hyah !
hyah !
hyah !
hyah !
conan !
conan , help !
help !
help !
do you know who i am?
taramis !
queen taramis .
not my queen .
you have a queen?
but you are a cimmerian .
the cimmerian's have no rulers .
you're a barbarian .
you live free in the world .
you owe allegiance to no one .
is that not so?
it is , and it always will be .
what do you want?
i need your help .
no !
no?
you don't know what i'd be willing to give if you help .
you have nothing that i want .
you were praying , conan .
what were you praying for?
look at the shrine .
see what you are praying for .
what is there , conan?
think .
show me the desire in your deepest heart .
valeria .
where is this valeria?
with crom .
your god?
she sits by the side of my god .
what i want , you cannot give me .
yes i can .
you can bring back the dead?
do as i ask of you , and i will .
wake ...
and remember .
tell me what i must do .
soon .
conan , look !
conan !
doesn't that animal look familiar?
i think it does .
i'm sorry about what happened the last time .
they love us !
we will drink to dagoth , the dreaming god .
what do you want me to do for you?
that will bring back the woman you love?
yes .
it is written in the scrolls of skelos ... that a woman child born with a certain mark must make a perilous journey .
it is her destiny .
my niece , jehnna , has such a mark .
i want you to take her on that journey .
to where?
jehnna will show you .
from the day she was born , she's been prepared for this .
there is a key she must find a key only she can touch as it was written in the scrolls of skelos .
where is it?
in a castle .
guarded .
by a wizard .
thoth amon .
by a wizard?
that frightens you .
you're afraid of magic .
and you will have to deal with it .
what good is a sword against sorcery?
then you're afraid to go?
no .
i will find a way .
what does this key unlock?
a treasure .
a jewelled horn .
only she can procure it .
only she can lead you to it .
and when she has it , you'll bring her back to me .
then you will have your reward .
we shall both have everything we want ... through magic .
no !
shh .
it's all right .
don't be afraid .
it's only a dream .
it's only a dream .
no !
i saw  a dream .
jehnna , it was only a dream .
be still .
lie down .
i i saw it !
no , you saw  i saw it again !
you saw nothing .
a nightmare .
i did !
imaginings out of excitement .
i did !
go back to sleep .
i saw it again .
shh .
i saw it .
i did , i saw it .
tomorrow , you'll start your journey .
you'll need all your strength .
your destiny is at hand .
sleep .
shh .
shh .
sleep .
all our destinies are at hand , even conan's , though he doesn't yet know it .
we don't need him , my queen .
i don't need the captain of the guard to steal a key .
that is a task for a thief .
what i do need you for , is to see that this dear child is returned safely to the palace ... with both the treasure and her virginity intact .
i will protect them both .
you better , my friend , for she must be a virgin when she's returned to me ... so she can be properly sacrificed .
one other thing , bombaata .
it is not wise to have the king of thieves near the treasure .
so when the key is in my niece's hand ,
i want your sword in conan's heart .
have the elite guard follow .
they will strike at the right moment to help you .
conan must die .
do you think he's handsome?
very ugly .
no , not him .
conan .
can't you judge for yourself?
but how can i?
how many times have i seen a man?
a real man?
all i've seen is you .
meaning no insult to you , bombaata .
yes , he is handsome .
conan , wait !
we must go this way .
not yet .
but you have to obey me .
weren't you told?
there are rules to every game .
i believe you , but there's magic in this game .
you'll have to be able to fight it with magic .
akiro .
crom .
what are they going to do?
have lunch .
those savages should thank me for sparing them a terrible stomach ache .
why would they want to eat someone as old and as sour as you?
they thought if they digested me , my magic would be in their blood .
at least they could have washed you first .
i need you .
i'm yours .
tell me more about this key .
oh , it's not an ordinary key .
it's a jewel .
a jewel?
yes .
the heart of ahirman .
well , can it be worn?
only by me .
no one else dare touch it .
if there is anything here that you like ... try not to take it .
i know when to steal ... and when not to .
get her .
get her !
what did she do?
she came with the bandits to raid our village .
the others are dead .
now it's her turn , after we have our fun with her .
don't kill her too soon !
save her !
thieves should be hanged .
conan , there are six of them against her .
one , two , three i think you're right .
and she's tied to the stake !
do something !
stop .
i think we made a friend .
wait here .
what do you want?
to come with you .
be off !
let me speak to conan .
i said be off !
stop !
leave .
i swear that if conan will let me ride with him ,
i will give my life for him .
we shall see .
the castle of thoth amon .
it holds the key .
come bring her , conan .
we leave now .
in the morning .
i'm the leader here .
lead in the morning .
it will be better .
we must rest .
my thinking exactly .
sleep .
in the morning you will touch the heart of ahirman .
the first to do so in a thousand years .
look !
jehnna .
jehnna !
jehnna !
akiro , where is she?
in there !
who took her?
a giant bird .
a bird of smoke .
into the boat !
somebody should stay and watch the horses .
malak !
i didn't mean me !
i'm rowing .
too late , my friends , but come .
come anyway .
how do we get in?
is there another entrance?
under here is a way in .
you mean under the water?
you can stay here if you like .
alone?
they need me .
ooh !
be careful .
bombaata !
wizard it open .
fine magician you are .
go back to juggling apples .
aah .
aaah !
get up !
get it !
get it !
get up , conan !
aah !
aah !
aah !
that's exactly what i would have done .
exactly .
there are only two left , wizard .
and you're behind one of them .
which one?
no !
no !
not here !
not this one !
bombaata?
bombaata?
bombaata !
bombaata !
i need you !
bombaata !
bombaata !
it's all right .
it's all right .
crom .
out !
out of here !
hurry !
hurry !
run !
no o o !
stop !
aah !
bombaata !
all an illusion .
help !
bombaata !
help me !
bombaata , where are you?
put me down , do you hear me?
look out , you fool !
bombaata , stop !
why?
i thought you were going to hurt the girl .
this is one of the queen's guards !
why did they attack us?
not by her order .
mmm .
wait , wait .
this is much better .
akiro's own magic mixture .
let me help you .
what do you think you're doing?
covering your wound .
my wound is lower .
we don't want an infection to spread .
i'll spread your head open .
this is what the world has come to .
you try to help somebody ... and what do you get instead of thanks?
threats .
now yell if it hurts .
i suppose nothing hurts you .
only pain .
after we return to shadizar , what will you do?
i'll find my kingdom , and a queen to sit beside me .
what kingdom?
the promise ...
i was " kingdomed .
no .
the kingdom i was promised .
what queen?
valeria .
valeria .
valeria .
what is she like , this ...
valeria?
do you see this woman over there?
zula?
valeria is like her .
she doesn't look like her , but she has the same spirit .
the same
the same , uh
strength?
strength .
strength .
and she's a warrior too?
a great warrior ... and a great woman .
could there ever be ... anyone else but her?
another queen?
lot on your knife .
not ... on your life .
excuse me .
i must get up now .
how do you feel?
welcome .
you are welcome .
i didn't know women could be warriors .
all my tribe are warriors .
well , it seems that men like women warriors .
some .
do you think that i could ever be one?
i could teach you how to use this .
yes !
please !
now , the power is in the wrists .
oh , i see .
like this?
that's right .
they've got to stay loose .
it takes practice and strength .
wait !
wait !
wait , wait , wait , wait .
hold on .
if you're going to learn how to fight , then learn with a real weapon .
not with a toothpick .
here .
i'll show you .
stand like this .
yes .
you do it .
try it .
and then swing it over your head .
oh !
oh .
i'll help you .
swing over your head .
ow !
good .
now you're ready to take on anybody .
how do you attract a man?
what i mean is , suppose you set your heart on somebody .
what would you do to get him?
grab him !
and take him .
you'd grab him , and ... and take him .
take him !
like that .
what did she mean?
what did she say?
well , she said that if she wanted a man , she'd , she'd reach out and take him .
good idea .
but then what?
i mean , you've got him .
what do you do with him?
that's easy .
you see , you just
you , uh
well , you see ... in order for a man to really know a woman , and , and for her to know him , they have to , uh
well , they have to ... to join .
join .
uh
uh ... get together .
you see , he has to take his ... his , uh , uh and grab her by the
uh , there you are .
joined .
i mean , how do you think flowers grow?
through this?
yes .
is this the only way?
yes .
we can't go around it?
i go where i feel myself led .
so i've noticed .
that way .
shouldn't one of us go back and stand guard?
bombaata .
together .
here .
let me help .
malak , go inside and see if there's a lock .
you mean in there?
go !
i found something .
let go .
easy .
it is written in the scrolls of skelos ...
that the horn will be found ...
by a woman child , a virgin ,
who will have a mark upon her .
and when the horn is placed once more ...
in the forehead of the uh , uh , dreaming god ,
dagoth will arise .
then let men fear .
death to the world .
the woman child will be sacrificed .
stop her !
the whole world  be silent !
crom !
death to the world .
life for valeria .
the girl's destiny isn't only to deliver the horn .
it's just writing on a wall .
she is to be killed .
sacrificed !
we shall see .
destiny or not .
everybody out .
out !
wait !
it's worth a fortune .
we come in peace .
then let us go in peace .
let the girl come forward .
we've been waiting for her all our lives .
we are the keepers of the horn .
it belongs to us .
no longer .
who are you?
conan .
i have heard of you .
you know the legend written on the wall of the crypt?
from the day of my birth .
you know what will happen if the horn is placed back in the forehead of dagoth .
the god will live again .
and we who give him life will stand by his right hand ... and rule the world with him .
you will die in the great evil that will come from his rebirth !
we will control him .
no one is able to control him !
his power and his evil are too great !
give us the girl , or we'll take her .
enough talk !
back to the crypt !
bombaata !
get out !
out !
let's get out of here !
behind the dragon there's a tunnel .
it could be our only way out .
the jewel .
take the jewel !
hurry .
hurry !
that way .
malak !
malak , come on !
malak !
it's the leader !
he's a wizard .
he's forcing the mouth open !
well , stop him !
kill him or something !
my dagger is gone .
you kill him !
not me .
it's bad luck to kill a wizard .
wait .
there is a better way to take care of a wizard .
well done , akiro .
enter the tunnel .
don't stop .
hurry !
run .
run !
where are the others?
they are coming .
don't worry .
go .
they've gone .
and taken their horses .
or been captured .
let's flee !
wait .
bombaata took her .
taramis planned it from the beginning .
we get the horn , her guards will kill us , and bombaata takes the girl and the horn back to her .
and her promise to you?
a lie .
where are we going?
to shadizar .
what for?
to stop jehnna's sacrifice .
but it's her destiny .
it can't be stopped .
you don't have to come .
i will .
i will .
i won't !
i mean , what's in it for us?
what are we?
some charitable institution?
we're thieves !
go !
i won't help .
hey !
hey , wait for me !
you know you can't do without me !
go !
go !
wait , conan .
wait !
do you have the treasure?
bring it to me .
reserves to guard the palace .
there must be hundreds of them around .
we can't get in there .
well , you can't say we didn't try .
the front gate cannot be the only way to get in .
oh , it isn't .
the
malak?
behind the waterfall , there's an entrance .
it used to be an exit .
my cousin's sister's brother dug his way out there ... when he was a prisoner at shadizar .
today is your birthday .
all of shadizar is celebrating .
drink .
to life !
for dagoth .
for dagoth .
oh , dagoth .
god of gods .
ow !
my cousin's sister's brother never said anything about bars .
how do we get back up?
the bars were put up after your sister's brother's cousin escaped .
cousin's sister's brother .
how many times do i have to tell you that?
you said sister's brother's cousin .
who cares whose it is !
what difference does it make?
at the first sign of life in our god , the girl must be sacrificed .
or as the scrolls of skelos say , " a catastrophe will befall us .
oh , dagoth .
god of gods .
power above all power .
yah !
kill her !
save the girl !
kill her !
kill her !
she must be sacrificed !
no !
get back !
down the steps !
no !
run !
his horn is his life !
tear out the horn !
zula .
i need a captain of the guards .
i see no reason why a woman wouldn't do as well as a man .
you .
me?
come here .
i understand that every king or queen must have a fool .
do i qualify?
more than qualify .
will the world's greatest wizard come forward , please?
at your service .
one cannot rule without wisdom .
let me instruct you in the fine arts of mystical  later .
rule shadizar with me .
i will have my own kingdom ; my own queen .
so it was that conan mourned his lost valeria .
at length , he sought adventure in distant lands ... and trod the jeweled thrones of the earth ... beneath his sandaled feet ... until , at last , he found his own kingdom ... and wore his crown upon a troubled brow .
