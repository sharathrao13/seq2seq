but nothing like ... this size !
he needs a van , just to move around .
what would something of this size be used for?
antiaircraft?
no !
you can buy them ...
missiles are best for the aircraft .
this was something else ...
something with one hell of a range !
not just a range , though .
see , this is a gun , it's a cyclic rate .
it sends out a hundred bullets , before the first one reaches the target .
the thing about boats like this , is it sells itself .
it has a lot for the money .
it's got radar , gps , autopilot , autotackle ...
this has even a cellular phone .
you can call your wife if you want to ...
so , what you think?

fallowing a lot of helicopter searching ... the team can infiltrate the weapon to a point here ... covering the northern approaches in " route 0ne " .

he doesn't have a helicopter or a team to help him set off .
he is alone .
