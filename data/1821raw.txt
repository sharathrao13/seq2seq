good .
how old are you?
fifteen .
who supplied you?
you think we'll shop you?
i don't do that .
ever .
i don't need to .
i do need to know who supplied you .
do you know why i'm asking you?
in case somebody else muscles in .
is that the case?
i stole it from stan .
stan irvine?
aye .
he's going out with my ma .
i knew he stashed it with the dogs , so i stole it , and my granddad's teeth .
could be true .
he's blaming a bent cop .
it is true .
i set him up .
i only phoned the polis to cover me .
stan's not the sharpest .
so you thought we'd tell him?
you'd take a tanking?
he doesnae bother me , but he might take it out on my mam .
you took some chance , wee man .
stay away from our fucking shops .
especially big jay ellis's .
you may be a breath of fresh air , kid , but there's a lot of fucking wasters out there .
do you know what initiative is?
laughing at the boss's jokes?
oh .
we might just get on .
fucking go !
give me my fucking trainers !
next time we see you , it'll be two broken legs and you won't need trainers !
piss you !
i'm fucking freezing !

there's your fucking pal .
i'm gonna fucking get him back .
it looks like it too , you fucking idiot !
oh , wait .
if we prove we can do this that's a big fucking if he's going to get us a regular supply .
the more we sell , the bigger our cut like a business .
they want reliable dealers .
no fucking junkies that are using and not selling .
we're dealing now .
what happens when it runs out?
where do we get the gear from?
how do we know it's not shite?
the guy's cool .
no .
he's a cunt .
you saw the club .
he's a fucking different class .
he'll do you in , just like that .
who cares?
all we need is a couple of months , no fucking about , we're rolling in it .
what happens to me and you?
we'll do it together .
we're a fucking partnership .
i don't trust him .
we can learn from him .
learn to arse lick?
make up your mind or i'll find somebody else !
do you want to end up like your old man?
that's fucking nice , isn't it?
or do you want to do something?
here , have a chip .
fuck off , man .
he's still a cunt .
a rich cunt .
so what's next?
we've got to prove ourself .
sell more than anybody else without getting caught .
we've got to move fast .
that's the secret .
i can get a fucking motor .
