one , two , three .
well , congratulations .
excuse me?
you're a guaranteed winner of one of three fabulous prizes .
have you ever won anything major before?
no , never .
well , you have now .
oh , my god .
are you kidding?
no , it's confirmed .
are you sure?
okay , what did i win?
either the chevy blazer , the paris ...
do you have a water filtration system?
one of them faucet filters?
no , sir .
i don't .
well , do you read the papers or watch tv?
sometimes , yeah .
well , then you've probably seen our advertisements .
the government is gonna make you pay a tax on the prize .
but if you buy the waterson 2000 water filtration system ... ... the prize gets recorded as a sales expense , and you don't pay any tax .
good deal , huh?
yeah .
yeah .
and then i get the trip to paris?
you're guaranteed one of those three prizes .
i'm gonna have a courier come to your house .
you're gonna give him a check .
he's gonna come to me , and then we'll decide which one of those prizes you get .
see how that works?
how much do i pay?
three hundred ninety eight dollars even .
you'd pay twice that in stores .
i need to speak to my husband .
irene , my supervisor just stepped into my office and he would love to talk to you .
can you hold just a sec?
thanks , irene .
good morning .
who says so?
irene fisk .
she wants to talk to her husband first .
mrs. fisk , john goodhew , regional vice president .
congratulations .
which prize are you hoping for?
paris .
that would be my choice too .
we've never been .
my associate tells me you have five grandkids?
wow .
i understand you'd like to speak to your husband first about this ... ... but the thing is , my secretary is having a baby this afternoon .
everyone at the office is about to head to the hospital .
well , that's wonderful .
let me confirm your address for our courier service .
all right .
hey .
sorry , sorry .
any thoughts on lunch?
spicy calamari?
thai food?
pygmies .
otis , hush , hush .
can i help you?
carolyn schaffer?
i'm agent kellaway .
this is agent cole .
we're from the federal trade commission .
sorry to disturb you .
we'd like to ask you a few questions .
is everything all right?
we hope so .
mrs. schaffer , can you tell us exactly what the man said on the phone?
he said that there'd been a contest , and i had won a prize .
there'd be a drawing next week , and i'd win ... ... either a chevy blazer , a diamond necklace ... ... or a trip to italy or france .
i don't remember .
and that if i bought one of their filtration things , i wouldn't have to pay the tax .
jesus , carolyn .
i wanted to surprise you .
i'm sorry to tell you this , ma'am , but you won't be receiving any prize .
and i'm sorry to tell you that you've been the victim of fraud .
otis , knock it off .
it's not the newest swindle in the world .
they bait you with something bogus , then sell you something worthless .
how much did you give them , mrs. schaffer?
seven hundred dollars .
what's it worth?
at any hardware store , 50 bucks .
jesus , carolyn .
but we've met people who paid twice what you did .
really?
yeah .
you wrote a check , ma'am?
did you mail it to them?
no , a courier picked it up .
what?
if they'd used the postal system , it's mail fraud and we can go after them .
otherwise , there's not a lot we can do .
unless ...
unless what?
well , a lot of these whack jobs ... ... work in syndicates .
if they cashed your check out of state , it's federal .
but we'd need a signed clearance from you ...
i'll give you one if it will catch these sons of bitches .
you have any more l 47s?
yeah , maybe in the car .
wait a second .
here we go .
my pen .
i got one .

oh , sorry .
sorry .

do you mind if i put them up?

go ahead .
thanks .
well , you're something of a clean slate , roy .
you were on medication , but you don't know what kind .
yeah , okay , good .
yeah , they were these little pink tablets .
i think it said " crc " on them .
something like that .
you were getting them illegally?
yes , i was .
so what?
why?
so i wouldn't have to talk to you .
do you know what they were?
yes .
at that dosage , you're lucky to be sitting up straight .
that's great .
can you get me some more of them?
you get to the point .
and you skirt it .
can you get me the pills?
yes .
well , then let's get that prescription pad out .
roy , i don't prescribe medicine unless i've chatted with the patient .
if you're inclined against that , this session will be quite brief .
would you like to tell me what's been bothering you?
i don't like being outdoors , which i know is called " agoraphobia . " right?
incorrectly .
but , yes .
anything else?
dirt .
especially around moldings .
i don't like when people put shoes on my carpet .
obviously , i have a lot of tics .
i find that very frustrating .
certain things distract me , make me feel sick to my stomach .
have these distractions affected your work of late?
and your personal relationships?
what personal relationships?
when was the last time you were in one?
with a woman?
a long time ago .
five years?
ten years?
keep going , man .
what was her name?
heather .
were you married?
kids?
maybe .
you haven't seen her since?
she left me with a black eye , which i gave her , and a bun in the oven ... ... which might've come from anyone .
so , no , i haven't .
look , doc , i spent last tuesday watching fibers on my carpet .
and the whole time i was watching my carpet , i was worrying that i might vomit .
i was thinking , " i'm a grown man .
i should know what goes on in my head .
the more i thought about it ... ... the more i realized i should blow my brains out and end it all .
but if i thought more about blowing my brains out ... ... i started worrying about what that would do to my goddamn carpet .
so that was a good day , doc .
and i just want you to give me some pills and let me get on with my life .
roy .
what?
he just gave them to you at the office?
he said they were new .
prefex something or other .
you feel better?
a little .
you want to work some?

what city , please?
woodland hills , california .
name , sir?
fenton , heather .

so leave a message after the beep .
hello , this is ...
hello?
well , you know , we fought a lot .
about what?
what do you got?
i wasn't sober a lot then .
are you now?
so some nights , she just didn't come home .
she was pregnant two months before she even told me about it .
yeah .
do you think about her much?
you know , what could have been , what might have been .
and the baby?
lf there's a baby .
do you think about that?
sometimes .
rarely .
like , if i see a school bus , i'll wonder , " is one of those kids roy jr .?
he , if he's a he , would be how old now?
he'd be 14 .
fourteen , ready to be a man .
yeah .
if he's a he .
if he is at all .
congratulations .
you bought yourself a week's worth .
thanks .
listen , doc ... ... do you know of a way ... ... just to find out , you know ...
there's nothing wrong with a man telephoning his ex wife .
i tried that last night , and i couldn't say a word .
so could you call her?
i don't know , roy .
l ...
please .
it's just to find out .
now?
no , after i'm gone .
when you can .
okay .
that's great .
thank you .
so i'm gonna see you on tuesday?

i ...
hello?
hey .
listen , i just got off the phone with heather .
we had a very nice conversation .
does she want to speak with me?
no , she doesn't .
she didn't understand it might help with your therapy .
you told her i was in therapy .
no , i told her i'm a psychiatrist .
i can't lie .

at first she told me you were dead .
then she said you might as well be .
i'm not dead .
i'm in antiques .
yeah , that's what the doctor said on the phone .
when he said that , mom started to laugh .
you hungry?
do you mind eating?
it's just i'd feel better somewhere indoors .
i get uncomfortable sometimes being outside .
really?
yeah .
you're staring .
i'm sorry .
it's okay .
i used to do it too .
looked at your picture , see if i got your nose , your eyes .
mom used to say i got lucky and only got your elbows .
thought you weren't hungry .
if you're gonna get wet , might as well go swimming .
so you're in school , right?
not now .
it's summer .
oh , yeah .

whatever you do .
everybody's done something bad in their life .
i'm in antiques .

to the business at hand .
to the business at hand .
i have one rule , chuck .
simple is safe .
i'll tell you as little as possible about what i do ... ... but as much as i need to to make you comfortable with what we're doing .
what are we doing?
five thousand pounds sterling .
a perk of working in exchange at a bank .
whose is it?
no one's .
just money unaccounted for , floating on top of the books like a layer of cream .
and he just scoops it off .
well , it's a little more ...
bob !
it's a little more complicated than that , but again , simple is safe .
why not keep it yourself?
as a bank employee , any attempt to change currency is recorded and questioned .
bob has a record .
you , on the other hand , no one bats an eye .
now , i hope you have something for me .
five grand , american .
congratulations .
at today's exchange rate you just made ...
$2567 .
looked it up on the internet .
he's fast .
that internet thing , that's a fad .
i can't figure it out .
me neither , but my daughter's a wiz .
you have a daughter?
two .
fifteen and 12 .
wonderful , i have a 14 year old .
it's a riot , huh?
little training bras hanging from the shower rods .
yeah , and everything smells like gum .
how do you get them outside?
mine sits at home all day .
summer is the worst .
the worst .
it's crazy .
it's wild .
he sounds just like him .
let me ask you something , arden .
how much could you do this for?
well , as a rule , we never go north of 10 .
how much could you get your hands on?
a lot .
all right .
put it there .
let's play ball .
chucky , baby , give me some sugar .

two fingers .
peace?
asshole .

you gotta spend money if you wanna make money .
you gotta make it to spend it .
everything smells like gum "?

it's easier if i show you .
angela?
angela , i'm back .
angela , frank's here !
hey .
angela?
she's not here .
she must have gone back to her mom's .
this teenybopper hillary says , " i am single , baby .
where does she usually go?
i don't know .
this is no good , roy .
it's no good for you or us .
it's got nothing to do with us .
hey !
pygmies .
yeah .
this is bad news , man .
you don't have to put it like that .
where have you been?
nowhere .
okay .
where did you go?
i just went out .
i went to the arcade .
it's like a half a mile away .
it's stuffy in here .
it smells like lysol .
where the hell were you?
i wanna know right now or i'm calling your mother !
i just told you .
i went to the arcade .
why did you sneak back in?
that's how i left .
i didn't have keys to lock the door .
so you didn't see my car?
jeez , you're worse than mom .
angela , listen , i'm glad i met you , i really am , but i've got a business ... ... and i've got a partner and i've got things a certain way , and that's it !
so , you know , i think it'd be better ... ... for you , most of all , if tomorrow morning i took you back home .
what did i do wrong?
you didn't do anything wrong .
i just went out !
god , i didn't even ...
i didn't drink , i didn't get high !
i didn't take any money from your stupid dog !
what , you never heard of a bank?
that is wrong what you did , and ... ... you're a nosy parker , and ...
and that's no way for a young lady to behave !
shame on you !
angela?
sweetheart?
i wasn't kicking you out .
i don't wanna stay where i'm not wanted !
it's not that i don't want you .
fooled me .
will you stop?
don't !
let me go !
you just don't want me going home to mom thinking she was right all along !
stop !
you're just like one of her boyfriends !
i'm just something you have to deal with in order to screw her !
please , you know that's not true .
even they tell me what they do for a living !
antiques dealers always keep large stacks of cash in their homes next to their guns .
okay .
okay .
all right?
i'm sorry .
it's just ...
i'm not ...
i'm not very good at being a dad .
okay?
you know?
all right?
i barely get by being me .
sweetheart , please ...
don't !
come on back home with me , and we can get a big pizza again .
you can stay the whole weekend if you want , all right?
why do you have a gun?
in case .
in case what?
it's hard to explain .
waller .
keep the change .
bullshit !
nope .
no bullshit .
and watch your language at the table .
you're a con man?
con artist .
a flimflam man , matchstick man , loser .
whatever you want to call it .
and that guy , frank?
he's my partner .
my protg .
teach me something .
what?
teach me a con .
you're funny .
no , come on , really !
teach me something .
i'm not teaching you anything .
why not?
you're a bright , innocent , beautiful girl ... ... and i'm not gonna screw that up like everything else .
really?
what?
you think that?
that i'm beautiful?
no .
then why won't you?
because crime doesn't pay?
no , it does .
it does .
just not very well .
you seem to be doing okay .
i'm not .
believe me , it's no fun doing what i do .
it's usually stealing from people who don't deserve it .
old people , fat people .
lonely .
a lot of the time , i feel sick about it .
then why do you do it?
i'm not as innocent as you think .
i've done stuff with boys .
i've done stuff with boys , if i told you ... ... you'd throw up .
then don't tell me .
then teach me something !
no !
final .
at the christmas dance last year , i went with this boy josh ward .
he's cute , and i really liked him .
i'm not listening .
after the dance , we went to carrie's , and he pushed me against the bed ...
not listening ! ... and he took his hand ...
no !
okay .
i'll show you one thing !
you will?
thank you , thank you !
all right , okay ...
thank you !
but then you're never gonna do it again , and you're gonna forget it .
agreed?
holy mary .
never work near where you live .
don't shit ...
don't write anything down .
all right , i want you to stay in the car , okay?
hey !
would you stay in the car?
i'd like to play this for the drawing on the 22nd .
you know the odds of the same numbers hitting in the same month?
or ever?
well , that's why i changed one .
you're wasting your dollar .
hey .
you his financial adviser?
no .
you're a cashier at a convenience store .
take his dollar and give him a ticket .
you're ready for this .
i was born ready .
glad i missed that day .
the most important thing to understand about this game is ... ... ninety percent of it is variable .
no matter how good a plan is , you almost always get thrown a curve .
so you gotta be flexible , prepared to roll with anything .
i'll do it .
just the 2 .
the one thing you can control , though , is who your mark is .
