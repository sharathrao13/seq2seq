is someone here?
no , i'm all alone .
would you like something to drink?
no .
i'm just here for my things .
you won't find them there .
i've already packed them .
i'll get them .
how are you doing?
you can't go on like this .
you need to get a life .
i have a life , like everyone else .
don't smoke in here .
you have to get a grip .
we were talking about you yesterday .
that's when i remembered to pick up my stuff .
why were you talking about me?
ke wondered why we broke up .
i had to tell him .
what did you say?
i told him why .
told him about it .
how things were .
shouldn't i have?
you had no right to do that .
sure i did .
we have decided to share everything in our relationship .
what?
is he outside?
yes .
he didn't want me to come up here alone .
we decided he could honk and i would wave if everything was ok .
was he worried i would hurt you?
i could never hurt you .
i only wanted what was best for us .
ingrid?

excuse me .
could you do me a favor?
what did you have in mind?
i live over here , and have something heavy i need moved .
i can't do it myself .
no problem .
i'll be over shortly .
can't you come right now?
do you have anything else to do?
no , i just thought ...
my name is anne .
john .
i know .
excuse me for disappearing .
i had to take care of something .
what are those doing there?
don't you have it like that?
no .
different strokes for different folks , i guess .
do you mind?
no , of course not .
i need this cabinet moved over there .
you can do it .
you sure are strong , to be able to move that .
i hope it's worth it .
i don't understand .
i'm kim .
john , your neighbor .
i know .
it goes in front of the door .
but i have to get out .
i forgot .
i'll do it afterward .
come and have a drink .
i think i'll just head home .
are you so busy you don't have time for a glass of wine?
have a seat .
that wasn't so hard , was it?
excuse me .
don't you wonder why we want that cabinet in front of the door?
different strokes for different folks .
that was just something i said .
i don't think people are different at all .
what do you think , kim?
people are pretty much the same , or totally different .
see?
go ahead and ask .
ok .
why do you do it?
why put a cabinet in front of the door?
why do you think?
i don't know .
why do you think two women , two attractive women .
have to put a heavy cabinet in front of their door?
is that so hard to understand?
no , not at all .
who are they protecting themselves against?
a man?
not bad .
what does this man want?
to get in .
excellent .
why does he want to get in?
because he is attracted to one of them .
or both .
do you find it strange that he is attracted to them?
no .
do you think it's mutual?
no .
what do you think , kim?
not bad .
no , not bad at all .
some more wine?
no , thanks .
i think i'll head home .
and do what?
you don't have anything to do there since your girlfriend ran off .
what do you mean?
what do you know about that?
your apartment is next door .
we can't avoid hearing what goes on in there .
you've been listening?
of course not .
why would that interest us?
calm down .
it wasn't our fault that she left you .
she wasn't right for you .
it was embarrassing to see you together .
you talked to her?
why would we do that?
how could you know this otherwise?
that's what it's like to live next door .
john?
john?
could you do me one more favor?
no .
i need to pick up some medicine and can't leave my sister alone .
this isn't my problem .
she was assaulted .
she was assaulted .
out here .
by the man who lived in your apartment before you .
the man who lived here?
he jumped her and dragged her into his apartment .
he did terrible things to her .
didn't let her go until the next day .
since then she hasn't dared go out .
what happened to him?
we pressed charges , but no one believed her .
he wasn't arrested?
he just disappeared .
no one knows what became of him .
that's why she doesn't dare go anywhere .
is that why you have so many things ...
kim wants to be prepared in case we have to isolate ourselves .
can't you stay with her for ten minutes while i run to the pharmacy?
lock the door and put the cabinet in front of it .
is that really necessary?
she'll panic if she sees it's not there .
we don't want that , do we?
go on in .
i'll be back shortly .
the cabinet .
i thought you had left .
your sister had to ...
what sister?
anne .
she isn't my sister .
she said she was .
why would she bother lying about something like that?
did she lie about anything else?
say anything about me?
she told me about what happened .
what?
about that terrible assault .
and that you ...
did she say that?
that i had been assaulted?
that's a new one .
and you believed her?
why would she lie about that?
do i look like i've been assaulted?
i don't know if you can see that .
that wasn't what i asked .
do i look like someone who has been assaulted?
where are you going?
wait !
stop it !
do you like my room?
give me the key !
have you been here before?
what?
of course not !
you have .
you just don't recognize it .
bring me the key now .
i don't want to be here .
are you angry at me?
you are .
then i don't want to talk to you .
hello?
kim?
kim !
kim , i'm not angry .
i'm not angry .
were you very sad when your girlfriend left?
yes .
how sad?
so sad that you no longer wanted to live?
i heard she cheated on you .
wasn't that horrible , when you realized she ...
did you ever think she would leave you?
i wish i could meet a man as certain as you .
there's a chair to the right of the door .
on the seat you'll find the key to the door at the end of the room .
anne had another line installed .
pretty smart , huh?
so you can call from room to room .
real smart .
you like it?
this is where i live .
that's not true .
can you let me out now?
so soon?
we're finally getting to know each other .
i have no business here .
i have no business here .
i'm not letting you out when you're this angry .
i'm not angry .
i'm not angry !
what do you want?
i want to talk .
have a seat .
sit down .
do you think i have had many men?
i have no idea .
what do you think?
anne was once with two men on the same night .
do you think that's possible?
probably .
it was in greece , or somewhere like that .
would it turn you on to be with a woman who had just had sex?
i don't think so .
why are you lying?
you think it would be a turn on .
let me tell you a story first , then i'll let you out .
what kind of a story?
you'll hear .
i'm about to start .
close your eyes .
why?
i want you to picture it .
one day , about a month ago , there was a knock at the door .
i opened it .
there were three men
in plumber's garb ...
what are they called?
overalls .
they look at me , then come into the hall .
i'm hardly wearing anything .
i had just come from the shower .
they look at me .
i can tell they are horny .
i say , " why don't we sit down on the couch first?
we sit down .
suddenly the one who's sitting next to me
sticks his hand between my legs
and starts caressing me .
the other one pulls down his pants and stands in front of me .
i take him in my mouth
and start blowing him .
then the third man comes up and bends me over the couch .
he bends me over and forces his way in from behind .
suddenly i feel the other one come in my mouth .
it runs down my throat .
then they take me one at a time .
it hurts a little , but i soon get used to it .
did you like my story?
didn't you?
i was just kidding .
do you think i did that?
i just read it somewhere .
come sit over here .
come over here .
what are you doing?
that's enough !
stop !
touch me .
do that again .
hi there .
hi .
how's it going?
fine .
what's happened to you?
nothing .
your face is bruised .
i bumped myself moving a cabinet .
are you refurnishing?
looks like you got a beating .
who would do that?
i have no idea .
if there's anything you want to talk about ...
thanks for your concern .
those are not coming in here !
look how much we already have !
i can take them .
no , you can't .
you aren't even well !
now you'll be stuck here until the wee hours .
it's no problem .
you always say yes .
that was probably your problem with ingrid .
don't mention ingrid .
could you look up a number for me?
36 swartzdorf street , 5th floor .
yes , that is my number .
don't you have any other numbers on the 5th floor?
how about unlisted numbers?
no?
hi , you have called ingrid .
please leave a message .
hi , it's john .
i was just wondering how you were doing .
i'm ... much better now .
i feel much better now .
i was wondering
if we could get together for coffee , or something?
have a talk .
i'm sorry
about what happened last time .
i behaved like an idiot .
anyway ...
what else did you tell him?
this and that .
like what?
stuff .
what kind of stuff?
stuff that happened .
like what?
that was an accident .
was it?
did you tell him i did that on purpose?
we agreed that it was an accident .
i thought so at the time .
now , i'm not so sure .
it slipped out of my hand !
you poured hot coffee over my arm .
you can't go around telling lies like that about me !
ke made me realize it wasn't an accident .
he wasn't even there !
he asked what we did afterward .
i took you to the emergency room .
the emergency room?
isn't that what i did?
we had sex .
for the first time in six months .
it turned you on .
remember?
that had nothing to do with it .
ke thought that sounded sick , to get turned on by burning me .
you know what i think is sick?
this ke person who asks his girlfriend
about who she has had sex with , and when and how .
ke thinks it's important that we tell each other everything .
is he outside?
yes .
was he worried i would hurt you?
i could never hurt you .
i only wanted what was best for us .
ingrid?
what has he done to you?
you were never like this before .
i wasn't myself before .
now i am .
ingrid ...
i told him everything .
how i had to make up crazy stories to turn you on .
but that isn't true .
isn't it?
you got turned on when i told you i had sex with other men .
please stop .
no !
maybe you want to hear it again?
how three men were standing outside the door .
how they took me on the couch .
is that the story you want me to tell?
how a man comes in and starts fucking me from behind .
how he comes inside me .
oh , john , i'm so horny ...
john , i'm so horny ...
who is it?
john .
your neighbor .
what do you want?
i just want to talk .
i've had a pretty lousy day .
me too .
what did you want to talk about?
i was wondering why i've never heard a sound from in here .
we can be pretty quiet .
no one can be that quiet .
what do you do in here?
we're waiting .
for that mystery man who supposedly is going to break in?
you expect me to still believe that?
why can't we stop all this lying and sneaking around?
never mind .
why are you so angry at ingrid?
we heard everything .
through the wall .
what did you hear?
we just had a little argument .
what's so wrong with that?
what are you going to do about it?
i think she wants to talk to you .
anne?
open the door .
stop kidding around .
hello?
you know you aren't allowed in there .
someone else is here .
i saw a man .
it's just you and me .
the door is locked .
i saw someone .
it must have been anne .
why do you keep locking me in?
why did you hit me yesterday?
why did you hit me yesterday?
kim , you started hitting ...
you didn't have to hit back .
you're stronger than me .
you could have just held my arms .
you're right .
i could have .
please , not now .
do you think i have had many men?
i have no idea .
she was once with two men on the same night .
think that's possible?
probably .
it wasn't here .
she was on vacation .
in greece , or somewhere .
would it turn you on to be with a woman who had just had sex?
would you find that exciting?
i don't think so .
who are you?
i'm on my way out .
you're john , aren't you?
i'm ke .
hasn't ingrid told you that we ...
yes , she told me .
she has talked about you too .
what has she said?
the usual .
it's only natural to talk about your ex .
don't you think so?
she was worried about you .
are you doing better now?
promise you'll tell me
if there's anything i can do for you .
promise?
are you angry?
i can't stand it when people are angry .
no .
no what?
no , i'm not angry .
that's good .
we should sit down for a real talk some time .
you could give me some tips .
about what?
about what ingrid likes , of course .
so i can get to know her better .
do you want to leave?
try this .
doesn't it fit?
ingrid told me about the coffee .
that wasn't nice .
i'm not one to judge people , but ...
that's inexcusable .
may i ask you a question?
is ingrid that type?
i've always considered her a careful woman .
haven't you?
i didn't think she'd go for that kind of treatment .
but i got the impression it turned her on .
didn't you too?
you were wrong the whole time you were together .
she wasn't the innocent little girl you thought .
i think she liked what you did .
she's one of those .
she liked it , john .
it's nothing to be ashamed of .
john , you've never experienced anything more intense .
isn't that right?
it's nothing to be afraid of , john .
it's too late .
you've already done it .
don't you remember?
don't you remember?
you asked us to take care of her for you .
that isn't true !
you should love her , john .
you weren't supposed to kill her .
i haven't killed anyone !
go look .
she's in there .
go look .
what's going on?
these are my things .
this is from work .
where did you get this?
and this .
i got this from my sister .
please tell me what you have done !
why are my things in here?
these are my things !
just go in .
she's in there .
go on in .
hello?
hello?
hello?
what have you done?
john?
are you there , john?
go away .
it's me .
peter .
peter who?
peter reis .
what's going on?
what do you want?
i need you to look at something .
what's happened to you?
are you sick?
what has happened in there?
what are you doing?
don't you have it like this?
no .
different strokes for different folks , i guess .
what are you talking about?
or else we're all the same .
ingrid used to say that .
either we're different , or we're the same .
may i ask you something?
you're in the hallway right now , aren't you?
yes .
what do you see?
a wall with a hole in it .
you don't see the neighbors 'door?
of course not .
you're the only one up here .
can i come in?
what are you doing in there?
what's that smell?
john !
what's going on?
go away !
john !
john , i'm so horny ...
i should have left you ages ago !
i'll scream for ke if you don't let me go .
go ahead .
ke !
ke !
ke !
help !
john?
john?
hi .
hi .
sleep ok?
haven't you slept?
no .
what have you been doing?
sitting there all night?
are you still angry?
angry?
no , you don't understand .
i'm not angry .
i'm just tired .
then come to bed .
you know that i would never hurt you in any way , right?
of course .
i would never do anything to hurt you .
not deliberately .
of course i know you would never hurt me .
why do you say that?
