that's all right , you know , it happens .
how's sara doing?
is everything okay with her?
she seemed a little off lately .
yeah , i guess so .
how's school for you?
it's about as good as it could be .

right around 1 : 30 p . m .
11 : 30 you said?
yeah , about .
okay , great .
all right , thanks .
and don't forget to bring your own steaks .
i'll see you then .
yeah , okay .
i'm saving for my car .
i'm paying it off this month .
surprise !
hello .
hi .
what's wrong?
nothing .
you were crying .
yeah .
is it something bad?
i don't know .
i'll see you later .
i have to go to a gay straight alliance meeting .
okay .
hi , acadia , how you doing?
we were talking about walking down a street being gay .
what do you think about that?
how can you tell?
or can you tell?
good question .
see , that's the thing .
i don't think you can .
i think in some situations you can tell ... and there are situations where people want you to know .
what makes you think you can tell?
if somebody wants you to know .
if someone has ... dyed pink hair .
wait , what do you think about that?
i know it is , but what do you think about that?
i don't think that wearing pink ... indicates your sexual orientation necessarily .
a lot of men wear pink .
it is a lot , yeah .
like rainbow necklaces .
i mean , if you have tons of rainbow paraphernalia ...
jump in on this .
help them out here a little bit .
come on .
did you guys see the cover story on the oregonian about the gay rams?
yeah .
see , this is a good topic here .
go ahead .
because apparently the farmers can't tell if the rams are gay or not .
so you get a ram to breed and it's not ... so they waste a lot of money .
so they're doing all this research .
they spend , like , $10, 000 on a ram .
that's a lot of money for one ram .
but the scary thing is if they know what causes homosexuality ... is that something you could change , something you could remove?
there's all this weird political stuff around it .
i don't think we're talking about the change , necessarily .
we're talking about if we notice somebody on the street ... if we can tell they're gay .
i don't think you can .
how in the world do we know their spirit?
if they wear one of those bracelets , the rainbow and stuff , that's a giver .
somebody walking on the street , all dressed up , wearing high heels ...
rainbow bracelets don't necessarily mean that you're gay .
i've never seen anybody wear one that isn't gay .
me , for example .
then why would it even matter?
you're wearing a bracelet and you're not gay .
who cares either way?
what time will you be back?
right around 1 : 30 p . m .
okay .
here's the deal .
aaron and i and some of the other boys ... we're gonna go fourbying later today .
we were wondering if maybe you would like to bring some of the girls along .
don't you remember what happened last time?
of course .
how could i forget?
with sara and jessica?
sara and jessica , they're ...
don't be mean .
i never tease you about jason and his hot dogs , or whatever .
that was an isolated incident .
besides , i don't know if i can go .
i don't know what time i'll get home .
home from the appointment?
yeah .
does that , by any chance , have to do with ... when we went camping , two or three weeks ago?
i don't know .
it could be anything .
you know what?
you don't have to worry about it .
you know why?
because we're gonna have a blast fourbying ... as long as ...
you gotta promise to show up .
hey , eli !
what's up , john?
how's it going?
pretty good .
what are you doing?
just taking pictures .
can i take a picture of you?
yeah , sure .
okay , ready?
one , two , three .
nice .
i'll see you later .
you going to the concert tonight?
no , my parents are being bitches .
that's retarded .
that happens .
all right .
i'll see you .
boomer !
come here .
what are you guys doing?
get the fuck out of here and don't come back .
some heavy shit's going down .
what are you doing?
when the electrons jump from one orbital to another one ... what does that do?
what's the difference between the orbitals?
the orbitals differ in energy .
the orbitals , which are areas in space around the nucleus ... the ones that are closer to the nucleus , those are low energy ... and the ones that are further away are higher energy .
so when we put energy into the atom ... it kicks these electrons out ... further away from the nucleus , and produces a higher ...
yes?
after putting electricity into the tube full of the electrons ... after they're lit up , do they stay lit up or can they run out of energy?
good question .
what they do ... is they will sit up in this higher energy state ... and then drop down again .
and when they drop down , they emit light .
what are you writing?
this?
yeah .
it's my plan .
for what?
you'll see .
hey , eli , what's up?
hey , how are you?
not much .
i'm just gonna go to the darkroom and stuff , so ...
yeah .
watch out for mr. robertson's class .
yeah , i know .
no kidding .
all right , i'll see you later .
okay .
bye .
how you doing?
pretty good , actually .
how about you?
fine .
michelle , look , we've got to talk about this gym clothes problem .
this is not gonna do it , these long pants .
everybody else is wearing shorts .
what's the matter?
i don't want to talk about it .
i don't want to give you a mark against you , either .
but i'll have to do it if you can't show up in shorts ...
like you are supposed to .
look , i won't do anything about it this time ... but tomorrow , i want to see those shorts .
okay !
there's that nerd girl who sits behind you in math class .
that one right there .
yeah .
her .
green panties?
loser .
where'd you take that at?
the bleachers outside .
pretty blurry , though .
what's that?
it's a rip in his shirt .
i thought it was coming out of her head .
i took that outside at the park earlier .
really?
that's pretty .
where'd you take that at?
at my house .
that's my light assignment .
great contrast .
i like how you can barely see the fence right there .
i think i'll make another print , though .
it came out too light .
yeah , you should burn in right here .
hey , eli .
what's up , john?
how's it going?
good , how about you?
pretty good .
what are you doing?
just taking pictures .
can i take a picture of you?
yeah , sure .
okay , ready?
one , two , go .
nice .
all right , i'll see you later .
you going to the concert tonight?
no , my parents are being bitches .
that's retarded .
that happens .
all right .
see you .
come on out here .
i got a job for you here .
you can take these books ... and you can reshelf them right over there , if you would , please .
i'll be here if you need me .
that's what they told me .
i don't know .
i mean , it's really hard to decide .
yeah , i know .
i mean , the money's really nice , but ...
he's so cute .
did she see you?
who?
did she see you?
who?
her .
his girlfriend .
he has a girlfriend?
since when?
you didn't know?
no , i didn't .
a long time .
are you joking?
i hope she didn't see you .
she's not gonna do anything .
she hit a girl last time for that .
hit a girl?
she slapped a girl .
no way .
she smiled , he smiled , and she slapped her .
my gosh , i cannot believe that .
are you joking?
i saw it .
why wouldn't she slap him?
because ...
it's not the girl's fault .
all girls do that .
in the middle of the hall?
yeah .
after school last friday .
wow , i am so tired .
i haven't been getting any sleep lately ...
'cause every morning , i wake up and my mom's going through my stuff .
going through your stuff?
yeah .
completely , like , ruffling through my covers and like ...
your covers?
yeah .
like , what would i hide there?
what am i gonna be hiding?
i don't know .
didn't your mom used to do that to you?
she did that a couple days ago .
don't go through my shit .
i don't go through yours .
it's not like you own my stuff .
i don't own your stuff .
i don't know .
okay , i'm sorry .
i won't do it anymore .
and then all of sudden , i'll come home , and she's in my room .
they think it's their job because they're the parents of the house .
i'm sick of it .
i want out of here .
i'm so ready to go to college .
yeah , i wanna get out of here .
only one more year , though , you guys .
one more year .
count it down .
what to eat?
i can't wait to go off campus .
can i help you?
can i have a milk?
wait , no , i think i want a capri sun .
can i have a juice?
i'll have that milk .
thanks .
juice .
this one .
yeah .
thanks .
what do i want?
none of it looks that good .
it never does .
some kids like this stuff .
thank you .
i know , they come back for , like , seconds and thirds .
they just keep coming?
salads?
it's too crowded .
let's go to the back .
where's a table nobody's sitting at?
where's your salad dressing?
i don't eat salad dressing anymore .
you don't?
i thought you loved it .
no , i hate it .
i used to like it , and then i tried once without it .
i cannot stand it without .
you know it has fat?
you know salad dressing has 20 grams of fat in it?
shut up .
it's not like it stays in us anyway .
i can't believe you just said that .
what if somebody heard you?
it's the truth .
is that john?
what is he doing?
is that a dog?
i didn't know he had a dog .
why would he bring it to school if he did have a dog?
i have no idea .
maybe he just found it .
you guys want to go shopping today?
that sounds like fun .
i don't know .
ben wanted to do something .
are you joking me?
what?
this is the fifth day in a row you're not hanging out with us .
you guys , it's like , how much time do you want?
put a number on it .
i don't even want to talk about it .
you spend so much time with him .
you get , like , 75 % to 85 % of my time .
yeah , right .
more like 20 % .
you do !
school , after school ...
you know , you can't have both weekends .
i need to split it a little more evenly .
we're not just people to be pushed out of the way .
i'm not saying that .
you're both very important to me .
i'm supposed to be your best friend and you pushed me out of it .
you're both equally as important , but my time has to be split up .
what do you want?
95 % and he gets 5 %?
your friends are supposed to be just as important , if not more .
all the time .
haven't you ever heard that?
i've heard that , but it's different .
i've been there for you , through everything .
we've been best friends for , what , three years now?
since high school started .
i know , i'm working .
i'm done , guys .
let's just go .
i'm going shopping .
sounds like fun .
i'll go .
i don't want to be the only one not going .
i'll go .
okay , i'll go , but you cannot drive .
yeah , you're not driving .
i am such a good driver .
you are not .
that's mean .
you guys can't say that .
i don't understand because everyone else thinks i'm a good singer ... and a couple of weeks ago , when i sang star spangled banner ... everyone thought it was really good .
that's why i'm really confused that you would say something like that .
seriously , i mean , why?
why do you think i'm such a bad singer?
do you guys have cars?
because i don't think you do .
so , how else are you going to get anywhere?
we'll go , just drive 15 under the speed limit .
you have to have your hands at ten and two .
that's no fun .
go back to the basic rules .
when you guys get your licenses , you'll understand .
we'll understand?
i just want to live to get my license .
we want to live to see the rest of our lives .
i'm not gonna kill you .
it'll be in the newspaper ...
i might run into a couple of people on the way , but ...
it's not funny .
oh , my gosh .
it'll be fine .
we'll just go .
this is disgusting .
i ate too much .
i always feel so fat after i'm done eating .
every time .
do you ever get ...
the pudge there?
where it sticks out above your belt?
and you can't get rid of it , no matter what .
so gross .
that's awesome .
what's up?
you suck .
see you tonight , dear .
yeah .
you know , jared's got the pole this week and the track record .
what's that smell?
that's just your mom .
you could find other places to eat .
i'm sure there's better restaurants in town .
no , you're the best .
want more of these?
no thanks .
all right , lock the door .
the radio has wholly taken over .
many of the cinema's ...
what was that?
i don't know .
all scripts must now be vetted .
the casting of actors must be approved .
from now on ... the german people will only know what their fuhrer wants them to know .
propaganda brought us into power .
that's a lot of flags .
this was made in germany , right?
yeah .
propaganda will enable us to conquer the world .
in his early munich days , hitler had taken an old hindu symbol ... the hooked cross , the swastika , as the nazi symbol .
now he multiplies it a million times .
from the romans , he steals the standards ...
can you still buy nazi flags?
sure , if you're a nut .
from mussolini , he steals the fascist salute .
check it out .
fuhrer , command , we follow you .
the fuhrer is always right .
who's that guy?
that's hitler , right?
yeah . ... who fears the intellect and hates all intellectuals .
so into the flames are flung the works not only of german philosophers ... scientists , doctors , poets , playwrights , novelists ... but those of all the world .
students as well as storm troopers obey the fuhrer's orders .
any culture except nazi kultur must be destroyed .
hey , how you doing?
you guys must be out of school today .
yeah .
good for you .
i'll have you sign for me here .
that's great .
thank you very much .
sweet .
it's here .
at a vast meeting in berlin ...
mussolini thanks germany for her help in his brutal abyssinian war .
and the fuhrer replies . ;
oh , yeah , dude .
this is so awesome .
peace , " did hitler say?
let's check this shit out , man .
hell , yeah , dude .
sweet .
back up .
whoa , dude , that was awesome .
hey , eli !
what's up , john?
how's it going?
pretty good .
and you?
good .
what are you doing?
just taking pictures .
can i take a picture of you?
nice .
i'll see you later .
you going to the concert tonight?
no , my parents are being bitches .
all right .
see you .
hi , michelle .
glad you could make it .
please come in and sign in here , then come out .
there are a few things we can work on together .
first , if you want to just take this cart of books ... and you can reshelf it over there in the non fiction .
i'll be right here to help you if you need me .
i guess this is it .
we're gonna die today .
yeah , i've never even kissed anybody .
have you?
i don't appreciate you putting signs out like that .
the next day , he called up his friend and has him put out another sign .
and she doesn't see it .
and so he puts out another one .
like , right in front of her house , in front of her apartment thing .
tim campbell's whorehouse has been shut down .
or " has been placed under new ownership by " whatever her name was .
he couldn't cut it anymore .
all right , let's see this .
so , we'll park here , right?
we'll enter through the south entrance .
then we go past the trophy case and the medal case , enter through the language lab .
they don't use it anymore , so nobody'll be there .
we'll gear up there , we'll hear the primary explosions ... go about here in the cafeteria , right?
when that goes , we should be able to pick off kids ... as we traverse the east wing .
and then we have another explosion that should go off here in the gym ... and here in the auditorium .
at that time , there should be kids flushing out in all directions ... and we'll be able to pick them off , one by one .
after that , you'll hit your yellow line here , which is your plan b.
and you'll go up through mr. luce's office and take care of that .
fuck !
while i go , on the red line , up through this hallway ... where we'll have the best targets , dumb ass jocks and shit .
because we'll have a fucking field day down there .
i mean , come on .
you've got your tec 9 and your rifle ... and i've got my shotty and my . 223 on my back .
and i got a couple pistols and a knife .
we have enough explosives to last us almost a day .
most importantly , have fun , man .
yeah , man .
what are you guys doing?
get the fuck out and don't come back .
some heavy shit's going down .
hey , don't go in there .
hey , you guys , don't go in there .
something bad is gonna happen .
don't go in there , okay?
dude , what the fuck?
don't worry about it , it's probably just slow .
let's go to plan b.
are you sure you set it right?
positive .
sir , don't go in there !
trust me !
just don't go in there , please .
don't go in !
dad !
hey , you guys ...
what was that?
sounded like bombs .
that's fine .
no more homework , no teachers .
that'd be so cool .
that'd be nice .
hi .
what's wrong?
what the hell is wrong with you?
okay , then be a bitch .
what a freak .
i think maybe everyone could bring ...
well , i don't drink soda , but some people do ...
what was that?
firecracker .
don't worry about it .
it'll be okay .
come on , sit down .
let's finish this .
okay now , we talked about what we're gonna do ...
nate?
come on , get up , nate .
here we go , let's go .
come on , let's go , now !
it sounds clear .
go !
down the hallway to the band room exit !
hey , mr. luce .
why are you doing this?
eric , put the gun down .
i ain't putting shit down !
put the gun down , we'll talk about this .
shut up !
dad !
the school's on fire .
are you all right?
yeah , what's going on?
i saw two guys come in the other side .
holy cow !
they had big black bags and camo gear on .
my god .
where did you go?
i just ...
i'm sorry .
yeah , you did , and i should shoot you right now for it , you know i should .
but i think i just might let you live , maybe , because i want you to know this ... and the next kids that come up to you with their problems ... that they're being picked on , you should listen to them ... no matter what twisted shit they say .
fuck .
anyway , mr. luce , whatever .
you know there's others like us out there , too .
and they will kill you if you fuck with them like you did me and jared .
get out of here , before i change my mind .
go !
bitch .
so foul and fair a day i have not seen .
fuck !
oh , my god , there he is !
oh , shit !
hey , man .
i wouldn't drink that .
you'll get herpes or something .
so how did you do?
did all right .
what happened?
i shot the principal and some other people , and ...
well , well , well .
look who it is .
dude , come on , don't do this .
