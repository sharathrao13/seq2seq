hey , you want to hear my short story now?
i could read it to you .
you mean , again?
i changed the ending a little .
oh .
what happens now?
well , actually , it's the same but longer .
i think it's better .
more ... raw .
then maybe you should just read the ending .
but it won't make sense if you hear it out of context .
i think you should leave it the way it was .
it was good .
so you don't want to hear my new ending?
you'll read it in class tomorrow .
surprise me .
anyway , i have to go .
i promised melinda i'd help her with her oral .
you're tired of me , i can tell .
marcus , i'm tired , that's all .
you've lost interest .
you hardly even sweat anymore when we have sex .
i was never much of a sweater , you know that .
look , vi ,
i don't blame you .
you feel pity now .
pleasure isn't there anymore .
the kinkiness is gone .
you've become kind .
when he saw her , it was as if he could walk like a normal person .
his legs didn't swing , his arms didn't spaz away .
he wasn't a freak anymore , for she made him forget his affliction .
no more cerebral palsy .
from now on , cp stood for ...
'cerebral person . '
he was a cerebral person .
i thought that was really good , marcus .
really ... moving and emotional .
i thought it was really emotional , too .
and , i mean , really good word choices .
it kind of reminded me a little of faulkner , but east coast and disabled .
or flannery o'connor .
she had multiple sclerosis .
and borges ... he was blind .
updike has psoriasis .
maybe i'm wrong , but ...
i'm afraid i found the whole thing to be a little trite .
its earnestness is ... well ... it's a little embarrassing .
those adjectives are flatfooted and redundant .
i'm sorry , i mean ... anyway , don't ... what do i know?
don't even listen to what i say .
i mean ...
anyone else?
catherine is right .
your story is a piece of shit .
you express nothing but banalities , and , formally speaking , are unable to construct a single compelling sentence .
you ride on a wave of clichs so worn , in fact , it actually approaches a level of grotesquerie .
and your subtitle " the rawness oftruth " is that supposed to be a joke of some sort?
or are you just being pretentious?
okay .
who's next?
marcus , wait up !
what do you want?
don't be so upset , it's okay .
what the fuck are you talking about? !
what's okay?
he hated my story also .
you story was terrible .
marcus , you'll write something better next time .
patronizing fuck !
if you had been honest with me in the first place ,
i wouldn't have read it .
i knew it was shit , but like an idiot , i believed you .
that's notfair , i was honest .
just because i wasn't sucking up like that bitch , catherine
i sure didn't hear you voice your opinion when it mattered .
i admit it , i was scared .
i was shocked , in fact , by what he said .
and he's so convincing .
i'm sorry if i let you down , but really ...
i still say he's just one opinion .
i don't even like his books that much .
they're all so ... aggressively confrontational .
i don't care if he's won the pulitzer prize .
you just want to fuck him , like catherine and every other white cunt on campus .
marcus , you can'tjust unilaterally decide to end things .
this is a relationship we're talking about , a friendship .
you don't just ...
fuck you !
fuck him !
fuck him !
fuck him !
vi , are you okay?
yes , i'm okay .
i'm totally okay .
you did the right thing .
i know that .
fucking cripple .
why do i waste my time with undergrads?
they're all so ... juvenile !
i just thought marcus would be different .
i mean , he's got cp .
what are you going to do now?
i don't know .
go to a bar , get laid , whatever .
don't worry about me , i'll be justfine .
what can i get you?
i'll just have a beer .
here you go .
hi .
hello , vi .
what are you doing here?
what are you doing here?
i'm sorry , i didn't mean ...
i just didn't expect to run into you here , that's all .
well ... now you have .
yeah .
then , are you alone?
can i join you?
thanks .
well ...
i just wanted to say that i'm really happy with the class .
i know you must hear this all the time , but i'm also a great admirer ofyour work .
a sunday lynching " especially ... really ... spoke to me .
god , i hope i'm not embarrassing you .
you're not .
good .
because ...
i really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was .
that's good .
i also agreed with what you said today about marcus 'story .
it is a piece of shit .
you have beautiful skin .
thank you .
catherine seems like she might become a really good writer .
maybe .
she's okay .
aren't you going out with catherine?
i'm sorry , it's none of my business .
i didn't mean ...
i'm not going out with catherine .
do you think i have potential as a writer?
no .
thank you for being honest .
i have so much respect for you .
can i just freshen up for a second?
it's over there .
thanks .
don't be a racist .
don't be a racist .
don't be a racist ...
it's really a nice place you have .
is the rent high?
take offyour top .
now ... take off the rest .
turn around .
bend over .
say ...
nigger , fuck me .
but i can't say that .
say ...
ni ...
ni ... ... gger . ... gger .
say , " nigger .
nigger .
fuck me hard .
fuck ... me ... hard .
say , " nigger , fuck me hard .
nigger , fuck me hard .
again .
nigger , fuck me hard .
again .
nigger , fuck me hard .
again .
nigger , fuck me hard .
again .
nigger , fuck me hard .
again !
nigger , fuck me hard .
again !
nigger , fuck me hard !
freak .
can i come in?
you're all ... sweaty .
so john flipped her around , and slammed her against the wall .
jane braced herself .
she thought about her mother .
she thought about peter .
she thought about god ... and rape .
say , 'fuck me , nigger , fuck me hard . '
john's flesh abraded her soft skin .
there would be marks .
she acquiesced and said what he asked her to say , and did what he asked her to do .
she had entered college with hope , with dignity , but she would graduate as a whore .
why do people have to be so ugly , write about such ugly characters?
it's perverted .
i know you all think i'm being prissy , but i don't care .
i was brought up in a certain way , and this is ... mean spirited .
yeah .
well ... it did seem a little ... affected .
like by using taboo language , you were trying to shock us about the hollowness of your characters .
i think it was a little bit racist .
it was completely racist .
beyond that , i felt deeply offended as a woman .
as if women could only operate from experiences of objectification .
totally phallocentric .
so weirdly misogynistic .
why does jane go through with this?
is she stupid?
hey , but wasn't this a rape?
or did i miss something?
i'm confused , because if this was a rape , then why would she be a whore?
it was confessional , yet dishonest .
jane pretends to be horrified by the sexuality that she in fact fetishizes .
she subsumes herself to the myth of black male sexual potency , but then doesn't follow through .
she thinks she respects afro americans , and thinks they're cool and exotic what a notch he'd make in her belt
but of course , it all comes down to a mandingo clich , and he calls her on it .
in classic racist tradition , she demonizes , then runs for cover .
but then , how could she behave otherwise?
she's just a spoiled suburban white girl with a benetton rainbow complex .
it's just my opinion , and what do i know , but i think it's a callow piece ofwriting .
callow ... and coy .
jane wants more , but isn't honest enough to admit it .
in the end she returns to the safety of her crippled translation , sexually impotent ... boyfriend .
this is bullshit !
her story was the truth !
right .
it's unbelievable !
it's clichd !
it's disgusting !
but it happened !
i don't know about what happened , vi , because once you start writing , it all becomes fiction .
still ... it certainly is an improvement over your last story .
there is now at least a beginning , a middle , and an end .
toby , i just know you're going to become a movie star .
please don't forget me when you make it to the top .
i will always love you .
pam .
hello?
hello .
is this pam?
who is this?
toby oxman .
toby?
oh , hi .
how are you?
i'm fine , how are you?
great .
great !
so what's going on?
i was going to ask you that .
but you called .
oh , yeah .
well ...
i was just calling because , well ...
i was wondering if you still remembered me , which i guess you do .
yeah .
so , look atwhere we are .
the year 2000 !
can you believe it?
did you ever think we would actually make it?
well , yeah .
so , are you still acting?
no .
not anymore .
no ,
i kind of came to terms with myself .
i realized i had done what i had to do , and it was time to move on .
what did you do after you gave up on acting?
i went to law school , if you can believe that .
i believe it .
well , it was really ... all kind of a joke and a rip off , the whole thing , so i dropped out .
that's too bad .
well , but then it got me writing , so that was a good thing .
anything i might know about?
well ...
i kind of let things go on this novel i'd been really into .
the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt .
really , it's finished .
that's too bad .
i worked over at a homeless shelter for a while , drove a cab to pay the rent , but that was ...
i mean , i have some dignity .
that's good .
so then what do you do now?
i'm a documentary filmmaker .
oh?
anything i might have seen?
not yet .
i'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers .
remember when we were teenagers?
yeah , you didn't want to take me to the prom .
i don't remember that .
i do .
well ... but it was so long ago .
we were so different back then .
well , anyway ...
i'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia .
it's kind of an exploration of the psyche , of its mythology .
i wrote to derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration , but everything's still kind of in development at this point .
i work in a shoe store right now .
but it's cool , i'm not ashamed .
i have a much stronger sense of self now .
and anyway , it's really very temporary .
that's good .
yeah .
so anyway , tell me , what about you?
i'd heard through the grapevine that you were producing movies .
yeah , but not anymore .
oh .
tired of life in the fast lane?
yeah .
so , you're ... married?
kids?
yeah .
how many?
three .
great .
how old are they?
eight , six , and four .
wow , that really is great .
in a few years , maybe they'll want to be in my documentary .
listen , toby , i can't really talk right now .
do you mind if i call you back?
yeah , sure .
okay .
bye .
okay , bye .
maybe she has caller id .
do you have any hobbies?
no , not really .
any books you like to read for fun?
no .
how 'bout those underground comics?
i hate reading .
all right , scooby , let's not beat around the bush .
with your attitude , you won't get in anywhere .
okay .
okay .
so you just don't care?
let me ask you something , not as your guidance counselor , but as a friend .
what do you want to do with your life?
what kind of long term goals can you possibly have?
i don't know .
come on , you can talk to me .
tell me what you're thinking .
i mean ,
i want to be on tv .
maybe have a talk show or something ,
like conan or early letterman .
uh huh .
how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
i don't know .
see if i have any connections?
did you knock on his door?
yes , but he just shouted at me and used the " f " word .
scooby , dinner !
would anyone be interested in being hypnotized after dinner?
no .
let's just start .
i don't know what's wrong with that kid .
maybe he's gay .
don't ever say that .
what if he is?
he isn't .
marty , ignore him .
he's vegetarian , doesn't do sports
brady !
and even if he is ...
gay people are people too , you know .
you're just being prejudiced .
i don't care if he's gay .
i'm cool .
it's not like i have to share his room .
i just want to know what he does in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner .
maybe he's building a bomb , just like
don't even joke about that .
i'm serious .
what happens if he blows up the school?
that's it , i'm going in there .
fuck !
was anyone in my room today?
is everything okay?
my cd case like totally collapsed .
i have to recatalog all weekend .
hey , can you pass the salad over?
steak's really good tonight .
good .
you have a lot of homework?
i don't know .
what do you mean?
you either got a lot or you don't .
what's not to know?
marty .
you started filling out your college applications yet?
i'm not going to college .
what are you going to do?
i don't know .
what do you know?
dad ,
i'm trying to figure things out right now , okay?
it's like , really hard ... and i'm just listening to some old elton john ...
gay .
out .
leave the table .
what?
you heard me .
leave the table !
man , i'm out of here .
this family is so fucked !
mom , it's not fair if brady can say the " f " word and i can't .
mikey , listen up , 'cause here's a lesson .
life's not fair .
i'll talk to you later .
i'll see you later .
later .
thanks , esposito .
consuelo?
consuelo?
yes , mikey?
do you have any brothers or sisters?
yes .
really?
how many?
four brothers and five sisters .
why did your parents have so many children?
i mean , if they were poor , wouldn't it be better to just have one or two?
it was god's will .
but do you really believe in god?
heaven , hell , and angels and all that kind of stuff?
no .
so ... how was school today?
the same .
the same .
the same as what?
just the same .
we're studying the holocaust in social studies .
oh , yeah?
we did the same thing last year also .
how is the class?
i'm supposed to watch " schindler's list " for homework .
the movie's , like , almostfour hours .
then i'm supposed to write a report on survivors .
you know any survivors , dad?
do i know any?
personally?
technically , your zeda is a survivor .
he was in a concentration camp?
no , but he had to escape the nazis .
but i thought he came over to america before the war .
he did , with his family .
but his cousins , they had to stay and they were all killed .
if he'd stayed , he would've been killed .
so in my book , he's a survivor .
even though it was only his cousins that were killed?
that could've happened to him , or to me , if i'd been alive .
or you .
or me?
you mean , then we're all survivors?
well , yes .
if it hadn't been for hitler , he wouldn't have had to leave europe .
we would've been european .
but then , in a sense , since you would've never met dad if your family had stayed in europe , if it weren'tfor hitler none of us would've been born .
get the hell out of here .
man ... !
it's just , like , conversation .
tell me ... you make a living at this?
well , sir ,
i'm actually not doing this for the money .
when you make a documentary , you do it for many reasons .
but money is certainly not one of them .
i don't get it .
well , sir ... a lot has happened to the landscape of the suburban high school since i was a student .
i feel it would be a valuable , perhaps even enlightening endeavor , to chronicle the changes .
to get intimate with the realities kids and parents face in american schools today .
yeah , well , whatever .
i'll let you know ifthere's interest .
excuse me , where's the bathroom?
you a pervert?
no .
actually , i'm a documentary filmmaker .
you mean like " blair witch project "?
well , no .
um ...
i'm doing one on high school students , in fact .
what for?
well , it's kind of ... it's kind of a sociological study on the aftermath of columbine .
is this , like , to get into sundance?
yeah , it's possible they would be interested in it .
doubt it .
actually , there is some interest from the sundance channel .
hbo and mtv have also shown some interest .
so you have connections?
we're trying to do a film on suburban lifestyles .
kind of an " american family " for the new millennium .
i thought this was about kids getting into college .
oh , it is .
which is it?
you got to keep your focus straight .
yeah , you're absolutely right .
the focus is on the college admissions process today .
and you want scooby to be the focus of all this?
scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds .
you didn't mention any other students before .
i don't have any yet , but
either scooby is the focus or forget it .
yeah , i thought i was the focus .
i want to be the focus .
toby , we need this to be a positive experience .
i suppose i could reconceive .
reconceive .
scooby does have a quality ... that i've been looking for .
a quality that is emblematic of america today .
it's part disillusionment , part hope .
twinkies !
boys , take napkins .
napkins .
not to be crass , but what do we get out of this?
don't worry , he doesn't mean money .
i know .
i know that .
well ... sharing your story , your ups and downs and so forth , can , i hope , be an illuminating experience .
yeah .
how do we know we won't be exploited?
no , it's true .
mr. livingston , i fully understand and i share your concerns .
you feel vulnerable .
i know this is a very difficult question but what it comes down to is ... can you make the leap offaith in me , the same way that i have to make the leap offaith in you?
this is a great school ,
i don't care what anybody says .
it's not perfect , but the people are really cool
iike the teachers and kids they really care and all .
i know they make fun of new jersey all the time , but i don't care , 'cause they're just snobs .
'cause jersey is where america's at !
walking down these hallways hallways just like the ones
i once walked down as a teenager ,
i couldn't help thinking back to a time when every day i woke up depressed , suicidal , consumed by despair .
had things changed?
was the competition to get into the most prestigious schools still a requisite rite of passage?
beneath these masks of courtesy and friendliness ,
i knew that there were darker forces at work .
and i knew that scooby was the key to revealing the truth .
scooby , scooby , scooby .
what are you thinking?
college , sats , your parents , your brothers , your friends ...
how is it you deal with all this stress?
the pressure to get into the college ofyour choice is incredible .
they did a study recently ofthe youth in bosnia during the bombing .
they found that the stress the young people experience there was less than what american high school students go through when applying to college .
is that right?
yeah .
my god .
so what do you think?
i'm not really sure what you're trying to say .
it's funny , i suppose .
but it seems glib and facile to make fun of how idiotic these people are .
i'm not making fun .
i'm showing it as it really is .
you're showing how superior you are to your subject .
but i like my subject .
i like these people .
no , you don't .
yes , i do !
i love them .
the camerawork's nice .
thanks .
i'll tell mike .
well ... it's still just the beginning .
i know i can ... dig deeper .
but , marj ...
may i call you marj?
what it really boils down to is , what does it mean to be a jew?
exactly .
tzedakah ... charity .
and the new wing at beth israel is ...
actually , last year you gave $500 .
but this year , $1, 000 would not only be a mitzvah , it would bring you to a new level
yes , of course .
your gift would also give you a chagall menorah and two tickets to the dinner dance this spring .
because it's true .
israel needs us now .
if not now , when?
that's wonderful .
i'll speak to you next week .
you too .
take care .
hi , scooby .
scooby ...
scooby?
how was school today?
fine .
ready for tomorrow?
what's tomorrow?
the sats , knucklehead .
i'm not taking them .
just ... back ...
mom?
yes , mikey?
i was looking through one of scooby's sat practice books and i took one of the practice tests .
guess what score i got?
what?
550 verbal , 520 math , and i'm only in fifth grade .
scooby?
yeah?
we have to talk .
what do you want to talk about?
don't screw around with me .
you know what i'm talking about .
you're taking those sats .
you're taking those sats or your cd collection's history .
you're taking those sats and you're going to college .
you're taking those sats if i have to strap your ass to a chair , but , buddy , you're taking them !
okay .
i'm tired of this shit .
were you surprised that scooby took the sats after all?
not really .
he's kind of a wuss .
okay .
how about you , cheryl?
were you surprised?
i don't know .
whatever .
how come you drive such a shitty car?
i don't know .
that's interesting .
a cool car .
is that something that's real important to you ...
brady?
a cool car?
yeah .
duh .
that's pretty cool , stanley .
thanks .
how did you get it?
it's my dad's .
he hides it under some old tv guides in his closet .
gee .
your dad's smart .
i know .
is it loaded?
no ...
i don't think so .
scooby , don't !
be careful .
i'm not an idiot , man .
i watch tv .
i know .
i'm sorry .
i'm just a little nervous .
i don't know why .
you should be .
here .
you can keep it .
scooby?
yeah?
you know ...
i like you .
yeah .
i know .
i mean ...
i know .
everyone knows .
do you think ...
do you think that ... you'd let me ...
okay .
if you feel like it .
just give me a second .
you want some?
no , thanks .
i'm sorry !
i should have never made you take the sats .
oh god !
i'm burning to death !
i'll never do it again !
hey , scooby .
how's it going?
conan o'brien?
what are you doing here?
i'm looking for a last minute guestfor my show .
any suggestions?
i'll be your guest .
really?
well , all right .
let's take a look at the television , and see how we look .
cool .
welcome to the show , scooby .
nice to have you here .
great to be here .
thank you for dressing up for us .
this is very classy .
tell us , what kind of professional plans do you have?
what's in your future?
well ...
i was thinking
i might work for you .
tell me , what do you want to do for me?
what's your idea?
be your sidekick .
and maybe , eventually , become a tv talk show host .
tv talk show host?
okay .
you were at sidekick eight seconds ago , then tv talk show host .
you'll be a latin dictator in about a minute .
let's see what they think of the first idea .
i'm curious what the audience thinks .
what do you think , should scooby be my new sidekick?
scooby , new sidekick , everybody .
what's up?
there's something i need to talk about with you .
what?
there's some rumors ...
like what?
you know ...
stanley .
what?
like , don't take this the wrong way .
i mean , i'm cool .
but ... you know ...
i've got a good reputation at school .
well ...
i really don't want it ruined .
no problem .
i'm cool .
thanks , scoob .
esposito , what the fuck do you think you're doing?
you're tackling like a bitch on my football team , son .
you better bend your ass over and hit somebody , understand me?
yes , sir .
yes , sir .
understand me?
then do it !
livingston !
that's the way to hit that hole , son .
we're going to become a football team today .
let's move the ball !
move , move , move !
break !
i want to see you hit those holes .
defense , fill those goddamn gaps !
let's go , guys .
let's do it .
set left , set left .
red , 1 7 ...
red , 1 7 ...
hut !
hut !
hut !
when i'm in high school ,
i'm not going to play any football .
i'm just going to concentrate on class rank .
what did you do in high school?
i did not go to high school .
weren't there high schools in el salvador?
we had to work .
my family was poor .
it must have been hard being poor .
i am still poor .
but , consuelo , even though you're poor , don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
no , mikey .
but , like ... what do you like to do when you're not working?
i am always working .
but when you're not , like now , what do you like to do?
this is work .
but it's not like ... real work .
this is just babysitting .
you know , your job's really not so bad , if you think about it .
you should smile more .
when the sky is clear and the sun is warm , you're reminded of how beautiful things can be .
a lamppost ... a sign ... a straw wrapper , blowing in the wind .
but when that dark cloud appears , you realize how fragile the balance of life is .
when brady first arrived to the hospital ,
he was unresponsive to verbal stimuli .
we performed a ct scan which demonstrated a large subdural hematoma with mass effect .
since the removal of the subdural , he's been in a coma .
when i first met the livingstons it was in the first 24 hours of brady coming in after his tragic football accident , and they were acting in a fairly typical way .
we're not the ones that need help .
my son needs help .
my son's in there .
he can't even feed himself .
i don't even know if he's going to be a vegetable or not , for christ's sake !
but what about scooby?
how would this affect him?
what meaning is to be found in this?
this is definitely better .
you think so?
you don't think that this might not be a little dry?
this is not an entertainment you're making .
this story about a kid in the suburbs , and the state of the college admission process , has , with this brady crisis , evolved into something much richer and more provocative .
yes , i know .
still , it should be somewhat entertaining .
without this footage , without this rigorous documentation , it would feel like exploitation .
no , no , no .
no exploitation , this is serious .
but don't you find it a little funny , too , at the same time?
you've got a family tragedy on your hands .
will you tell me what's funny about that?
about a kid in a coma?
nothing , i guess .
why are you making this if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
okay , you're right .
you're right .
we need to screen what we've got .
invite some regular people , just some random off the street types , and see what real people think of this .
i don't know , toby .
we really have a long way to go .
you still need to get a lot more footage .
it's probably a little premature
then we can invite serious intellectual types .
we're not ready .
hip alternative types ... who understand the process .
toby , we're not ready !
i need to see this with an audience .
what's an audience gonna tell you?
i don't know .
maybe they'll like it .
consuelo !
i spilled some grape juice on the floor .
consuelo?
consuelo?
are you crying?
no .
yes , you are .
i can tell .
what's the matter?
mi jesus .
mi jesus .
speak english .
mi jesus est muerto !
consuelo ,
i'm sorry , but you know if you don't speak english ...
i can't understand you .
my jesus .
who is jesus?
my baby .
you have a baby?
my grandchild baby .
i didn't even know you had any children .
but why are you so upset about jesus?
he is dead .
how did that happen?
he was executed .
he was on death row ... and then he was executed .
how did they execute him?
poison gas .
maybe it's for the best .
i mean , if he was guilty of doing something wrong .
people who are bad should be killed .
don't you think so?
jesus was not bad .
maybe he was and you just didn't know it .
he wasn't .
but still , you can't be sure .
i am sure .
but really , you never know .
i know !
why was he on death row?
for rape and murder .
consuelo , what is rape , exactly?
it is when you ...
love someone ... and they don't love you , and you do something about it .
sometimes i feel like my parents don't love me .
well , then , when you get older , you can do something about it .
consuelo?
i spilled some grape juice upstairs .
do you think you could clean up the floor now?
dad?
do you think that brady will ever get better?
one in a million recover .
maybe he's that one in a million .
mikey , there's optimism , and then there's stupidity .
it's a very fine line .
i don't think there's any hope either .
i was just trying to make you feel better .
thanks .
you're welcome .
dad?
would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
yeah , sure .
go ahead .
hypnotize me .
okay .
stay there .
i'll be right back .
just a sec !
be right there .
could you turn around to me?
just turn .
thanks .
all right .
you must look at this shiny object ... and concentrate .
relax your legs .
relax your arms .
relax your shoulders .
now keep your eyes on the shiny object .
your eyelids are getting heavy .
heavier .
you're getting sleepy .
sleepier .
now let your eyes close shut ... and you are sound asleep .
now ... you are completely under my power .
i am the only voice you can hear , the only voice you will listen to .
now ... when you wake up , you will be in a good mood .
you won't worry so much about brady .
and i will be your favorite from now on .
if brady dies , you can be sad for a little bit , but i will still be the most important person in your life .
you will never be mean to me , and always give me whatever i want .
also , you should fire consuelo .
she's lazy .
now , when i snap my fingers , you will remember nothing , but you will do everything i have asked .
one ... two ... three .
hey , mikey , want to get some ice cream?
okay !
it's like , yeah ...
i caved in .
i mean , i had to .
my parents , they're like ... still really depressed about brady .
so i wrote the bullshit essay , filled out the applications , did the interviews ...
i figure i can always drop out .
where did you get in?
princeton .
what did you get on your sats?
200 verbal , 710 math .
kinda weird , i know , but i think they thought it was , like ... good weird .
we used pull .
you have to .
sometimes you just have to , toby .
what kind of pull did you have?
i have a cousin .
very big giver to the alumni fund .
it's all about who you know .
look , we're not suckers .
everyone else is out there doing the same thing .
he's right .
damn , toby .
it's too hard .
this thing won't open again .
don't .
let me try it .
it's ... yes , the button is just stuck .
hey , toby?
hey , man .
i was wondering ... is the documentary almost finished?
yeah , we're getting there .
can i see what you have so far?
sure ... yeah , as soon as i have a screening , i'll let you know .
thanks , man .
okay , man .
okay .
gin , i win .
let's play again .
hey , mikey !
hey , dad .
come here and give me a hug .
gee , you're home early .
yeah .
listen , why don't you go upstairs and keep your mom and brady company for a bit?
i need to speak alone with consuelo for a moment .
sure , dad .
take off .
consuelo ...
mrs. livingston and i have discussed this , and we've come to the conclusion that we are not very happy with your work lately .
so we're going to let you go .
i don't understand .
we've been happy with you in the past , but now we think , maybe it's time for a change .
i know you've had trouble at home .
maybe some of that is reflecting on your work .
but , mr. livingston ...
i work very hard for you ... and your family .
i understand .
i'm sorry it had to end this way .
florsheim , can i help you?
hi , i'm trying to reach toby oxman .
sorry , he's offtoday .
okay .
um ... thanks .
hey , mike .
is toby here?
no , he's not .
do you have any idea where he might be?
i think he's at a test screening .
i think scooby's like a lot of kids .
he just hit a speed bump .
now he's going to find his way , his path's going to be clear , and i think he's going to continue his education at a good college .
and everybody else is going to be happy .
mr. livingston , aren't you a bit fearful that scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism?
i don't know why this is so hard for you to comprehend .
i had a terrific time in college .
i've got a terrific job , a comfortable salary , terrific wife , three terrific kids , and every year i give to the alumni fund .
now , why are you trying to make college out to be a bad thing?
a negative experience?
you had a bad time?
well , too bad !
get over it !
stop trying to impose your misery on others by going around saying ,
life is bad .
life is horrible .
life is tough on you?
well , boo hoo !
well , yeah .
my dad is kind of a goofball .
you just have to ... pretend to go along with his ideas ,
'cause he really doesn't get it .
like , i could be the next oprah ... for all he knows , but he's never even seen the show .
what is most important to you?
i don't know .
i'd like to be good at something .
it doesn't have to be tv .
i mean ... it could be movies ... anything .
i'd be willing to direct .
i'd like to be ... you know ... famous .
not necessarily a superstar .
just famous .
be recognized .
get fan mail ... things .
scooby , now i understand how you want to be like a tv talk show host and all ,
like conan o'brien , but did you know that even he went to college?
he did?
yeah .
he went to harvard .
... one police officer , eight others were wounded ...
mom?
dad?
can i sleep with you?
i'm scared .
sure , buddy .
come on .
come in bed with us .
come on .
snug as a bug in a rug ,
yeah , there you go , pally .
you're monster proofed .
scooby ...
oh my god , scooby .
i'm so sorry .
i'm so , so sorry .
don't be .
the movie's a hit .
