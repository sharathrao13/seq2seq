# see them tumbling down #
# pledging their love to the ground #
a way out west there was this fella , fella i want to tell you about , fella by the name of jeff lebowski , at least that was the handle
that his loving parents gave him .
but he never had much use for it himself .
this lebowski , he called himself the dude .
now dude , that's a name no one would self apply where i come from .
but then , there was a lot about the dude that didn't make a whole lot of sense to me , and a lot about where he lived , likewise .
but then again , maybe that's why i found the place so dern interesting .
they call los angeles the city of angels .
i didn't find it to be that exactly .
but i'll allow there are some nice folks there .
'course i can't say i seen london ,
and i never been to france ,
and i ain't never seen no queen in her damned undies as the fella says .
but i'll tell you what , after seeing los angeles
and this a here story i'm about to unfold ,
well , i guess i seen somethin 'every bit as stupefyin 'as you'd see in any of those other places , and in english , too .
so i can die with a smile on my face without feeling like the good lord gypped me .
now this here story i'm about to unfold took place back in the early nineties , just about the time of our conflict with saddam and the iraqis .
i only mention it 'cause sometimes there's a man ,
i won't say a hero ,
'cause what's a hero?
but sometimes there's a man , and i'm talking about the dude here , sometimes there's a man , he's the man for his time and place .
he fits right in there , and that's the dude , in los angeles .
and even if he's a lazy man , and the dude was most certainly that , quite possibly the laziest in los angeles county , which would place him high in the running for laziest worldwide .
but sometimes there's a man , sometimes ...
there's a man .
wow , lost my train of thought here .
i done introduced him enough .
all for a collective action .
this will not stand .
this will not stand , this aggression against kuwait .
# here on the range i belong #
# drifting along with the tumbling #
# tumbleweed #
where's the money , lebowski?
i want that money , lebowski .
bunny says you're good for it .
where's the money , lebowski?
where's the fucking money , shithead? !
it's down there somewhere .
let me take another look .
don't fuck with us !
your wife owes money to jackie treehorn ,
that means you own money to jackie treehorn .
ever thus to deadbeats , lebowski .
no , no , don't do that
not on the rug , man .
see?
see what happens , lebowski?
you see what happens?
nobody calls me lebowski .
you got the wrong guy .
i'm the dude , man .
your name's lebowski , lebowski .
your wife is bunny .
my my wife .. my wife bunny?
do you see a wedding ring on my finger?
does this place look like i'm fucking married?
the toilet seat's up , man .
what the fuck is this?
obviously , you're not a golfer .
woo?
isn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire?
yeah , what do you think?
he looks like a fucking loser .
hey , at least i'm housebroken .
fucking time wasted .
thanks a lot , asshole .
# the man in me will do #
# nearly any task #
# and as for compensation #
# there's a little he would ask #
# take a woman like you #
# to get through #
# to the man in me #
# the storm clouds are raging #
# all around my door #
# i think to myself #
# i might not take it anymore #
# take a woman like your kind #
# to find the man in me #
# but , oh #
# what a wonderful feeling #
# just to know that you are near #
# that sets my heart a reelin '#
# from my toes #
# up to my ears #
# the man in me will hide sometimes #
# to keep from being seen #
# but that's just because #
# he doesn't want to turn into some machine #
# take a woman like you #
# to get through #
# to the man in me #
i'm throwing rocks tonight .
mark it , dude .
this was a valued rug .
this was a ...
yeah , man , it really tied the room together .

what tied the room together , dude?
my rug .
were you listening to the dude's story , donny?

were you listening to the dude's story?
i was bowling .
so you have no frame of reference here , donny .
you're like a child who wanders in in the middle of a movie
walter , what's the point , man?
there's no reason here's my point , dude
there's no fucking reason
yeah , walter , what's your point?

walter , the chinaman who peed on my rug ,
i can't go give him a bill .
so what the fuck are you talking about?
what the fuck are you talking about?
the chinaman is not the issue here , dude .
i'm talking about drawing a line in the sand , dude .
across this line , you do not

asian american , please .
walter , this isn't a guy who built the railroads here , this is a guy
what the fuck are you talking
walter , he peed on my rug .
he peed on the dude's rug .
donny , you're out of your element .
dude , the chinaman is not the issue here .
so , ... who ..
jeff lebowski .
the other jeffrey lebowski , the millionaire .
that's fucking interesting , man .
that's fucking interesting .
plus , he has the wealth , obviously , and the resources , so that there's no reason there's no fucking reason why his wife should go out and owe money all over town , and then they come and they pee on your fucking rug !
am i wrong?
no .
am i wrong?
ok , then .
that rug really tied the room together ,
did it not?
fuckin 'a !
and this guy peed on it .
donny , please .
you know , this is the fucking guy
i could find this fucking lebowski guy .
his name is lebowski?
that's your name , dude .
this is the guy who should compensate me for the fucking rug .
his wife goes out and owes money all over town , and they pee on my rug?
they pee on your fucking rug .
they pee on my fucking rug .
that's right , dude .
they peed on your fucking rug .
this is the study .
as you can see , the various commendations ...
jeffrey lebowski .
honorary degrees , etcetera . very impressive .
oh , please feel free to inspect them .
oh , no , i'm not really that
oh , please , please .
that is the key to the city of pasadena ,
which mr. lebowski received 2 years ago
in recognition of his various civic ...
oh , that's the los angeles
chamber of commerce business achiever award , which is given oh , not necessarily given every year .
hey , is this , is this him with nancy?
yes , indeed , that is mr. lebowski with the first lady , yes . it was taken when
that's , lebowski on the left there?
yeah , of course .
mr. lebowski on the left so he's a cripple
uh , you know , a handicapped guy?
mr. lebowski is disabled , yes .
uh , this picture was taken when mrs. reagan was first lady of the nation ,
yes , yes .
not of california .
pope john . .. in fact , he met privately with the president , though unfortunately ,
there wasn't enough time for a photo opportunity .
oh , nancy's pretty good .
oh , wonderful woman . we're very happy these are ... oh , those are mr. lebowski's children , so to speak .
different mothers , huh?
racially , pretty cool .
they're not literally his children .
they're the little lebowski urban achievers ,
inner city children of promise but without the necessary means for necessary means for a higher education .
so mr. lebowski is committed to sending all of them to college .
excuse me .
thank you .
thank you .
far out .
think he's got room for one more?
you never went to college .
please , don't touch that .
yeah , no , i did , but , you know ,
i spent most of my time , um , occupying various administration buildings , smoking a lot of thai stick , breaking into the r. o. t. c. , and bowling . to tell you the truth , brandt ,
i don't remember most of it .
ok , sir , you're a lebowski , i'm a lebowski ,
that's terrific .
but i'm very busy , as i imagine you are .
what can i do for you , sir?
uh , well , sir , it's , this rug i have .
it really tied the room together .
you told brandt on the phone , he told me .
where do i fit in?
well , they were
they were looking for you , these 2 guys .
i'll say it again .
you told brandt on the phone , he told me .
i know what happened .
yes?
yes?
oh , so you know that
they were trying to piss on your rug?
did i urinate on your rug?
you mean , did you personally come and pee on my rug?
hello !
do you speak english , son?
parla usted ingles?
i'll ask you again .
did i urinate on your rug?
no , like i said , woo peed on my rug .
i just want to understand this , sir .
every time a rug is micturated upon
in this fair city , i have to compensate the person
come on , man ,
i'm not trying io scam anybody here . .. you know , i .. was just
you were just looking for a handout
like every other ...
are you employed , mr. lebowski?
uh , wait , let me
let me explain something to you .
i am not mr. lebowski .
you're mr. lebowski .
i'm the dude .
so that's what you call me ,
you know , that or , his dudeness ,
or , duder , or , you know , el duderino ,
if you're not into the whole brevity thing .
are you employed , sir?
employed?
you don't go out looking for a job dressed like that , do you , on a weekday?
is this a .. what day is this?
well , i do work , sir .
so if you don't mind
no , i do mind .
uh , the dude minds .
this will not stand , you know .
this aggression will not stand , man .
i mean , your wife owes
my wife is not the issue here !
i hope that someday my wife will learn to live on her allowance , which is ample , but if she does not , that is her problem , not mine , just as the rug is your problem , just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility , regardless of who he chooses to blame .
i didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs .
some chinaman took them from me in korea .
but i went out and achieved anyway .
i cannot solve your problems , sir , only you can .
oh , fuck it .
yes , that's your answer .
that's your answer to everything .
tattoo it on your forehead .
your revolution is over , mr. lebowski !
condolences !
the bums lost !
my advice to you is to do what your parents did !
get a job , sir !
the bums will always lose !
do you hear me , lebowski? !
the bums will always lose !
how was your meeting , mr. lebowski?
ok .
the old man told me to take any rug in the house .
well , enjoy , and perhaps we'll see you again sometime , dude .
yeah , sure , if i'm in the neighborhood ,
you know , and ...
i need to use the john .
blow on them .
go ahead , blow .
you want me to blow on your , toes?
i can't blow that far .
are you sure he won't mind?
he really doesn't care about anything .
he's a nihilist .
oh , and that must be exhausting .
you're not blowing .
our guest has to be getting along , mrs. lebowski .
oh , you're bunny .
i'll suck your cock for $1, 000 .
wonderful woman .
we're all .. we're all very fond of her .
very free spirited .
brandt can't watch , though ,
or he has to pay 100 . .. that's marvelous .
uh , i'm just gonna go find a cash machine .
slamming them tonight .
you guys are dead in the water .
all right !
way to go , donny !
if you will it , it is no dream .
you're fucking 20 minutes late , man .
what the fuck is that?
theodore herzel .
the state of israel .
if you will it , dude ,
it is no dream .
what the fuck you talking about , man?
the carrier .
what's in the fucking carrier?
oh , cynthia s dog .
i think it's a pomeranian .
i can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture .
i'm watching it while cynthia and marty ackerman are in hawaii .
you brought a fucking pomeranian bowling?
what do you mean , " brought it bowling "?
i didn't rent it shoes ,
i'm not buying it a fucking beer , he's not taking your fucking turn , dude .
man , if my fucking ex wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to honolulu ,
i'd tell her to go fuck herself .
why can't she board it?
first of all , dude , you don't have an ex .
secondly , this is a fucking show dog with fucking papers .
you can't board it .
it gets upset .
its hair falls out .
the fucking dog has fucking papers .
over the line !
i'm sorry , smokey , you were over the line .
that's a foul .
bullshit .
mark it 8 , dude .
uh , excuse me , mark it zero .
next frame .
bullshit , walter .
mark it 8 , dude .
smokey , this is not 'nam , this is bowling .
there are rules .
hey , walter , come on , it's just
hey , man , it's smokey .
so his toe slipped over a little .
you know , it's just a game , man .
this is a league game .
this determines who enters the next round robin .
am i wrong?
yeah , but i wasn't
am i wrong?
yeah , but i wasn't over .
give me the marker , dude .
i'm marking an 8 .
smokey , my friend ,
you're entering a world of pain .
walter , man .
you mark that frame an 8 ,
you're entering a world of pain .
a world of pain .
look , dude , this is your partner .
has the whole world gone crazy? !
am i the only one around here who gives a shit about the rules? !
mark it zero !
they're calling the cops , man .
put the piece away .
mark it zero !
walter , put the piece away .
you think i'm fucking around here?
mark it zero !
all right , it's fucking zero .
you happy , you crazy fuck?
it's a league game , smoke .
you can't do that , man .
these guys , you know , they're like me .
they're pacifists .
smokey was a conscientious objector .
you know , dude , i , myself , dabbled in pacifism at one point , not in 'nam , of course .
and you know he's got emotional problems , man .
you mean , beyond pacifism?
he's fragile , very fragile .
huh .
i did not know that .
.. it's all water under the bridge , and we do enter the next round robin .
am i wrong?
no , you're not wrong .
am i wrong?
you're not wrong , walter , you're just an asshole !
ok , then .
we play quintana and o brien next week .
they should be pushovers .
man , will you just
just take it easy , man .
you know , that's your answer for everything , dude .
and let me point out something .
pacifism is not look at our current situation with that camelfucker in iraq .
pacifism is not something to hide behind .
just take it easy , man .
i'm perfectly calm , dude .
yeah , waving the fucking gun around?
calmer than you are .
will you just take it easy?
calmer than you are .
dude , this is smokey .
look , i don't want to be a hard on about this , and i know it wasn't your fault , but i just thought it was fair to tell you that gilbert and i will be submitting this to the league and asking them to set aside the round ,
i don't know , maybe forfeit it to us .
so , like i say , just thought , you know , fair warning .
tell walter .
i'm sorry .
mr. lebowski , this is brandt at , well , at mr. lebowski's office .
please call us as soon as it's convenient .
mr. lebowski , this is bill selliger of the southern cal bowling league , and i just got an informal report that a member of your team , a walter sobchak , drew a firearm during league play .
if this is true , of course , it contravenes a number of the league's bylaws and also article 27 of the league
dude , i .. finally got ..
i got the , the venue i wanted .
i'm performing my dance quintet , you know , my cycle , at crane jackson's fountain street theater on tuesday night , and , well , i d love it if you came and gave me notes .
i'll be there , man .
tomorrow's already the 10th .
far out .
oh . all right , ok .
just , just slip the rent under my door .
... serious infraction and examine your standing .
thank you .
mr. lebowski , brandt again .
please do call us as soon as you get in , and i'll send a limo .
i hope you're not avoiding this call because of the rug ..
which , i assure you , is not a problem .
we need your help , and ...
well , we'd very much like to see you .
thank you . it's brandt .
we've had some terrible news .
mr. lebowski's in seclusion in the west wing .
funny ...
i can look back on a life of achievement , challenges met , competitors bested , obstacles overcome .
i've accomplished more than most men and without the use of my legs .
what makes a man , mr. lebowski?
i .. don't know , sir .
is it being prepared to do the right thing?
whatever the cost?
isn't that what makes a man?
sure , that and a pair of testicles .
you're joking .
but ...
perhaps you're right .
you mind if i do a " j "?
bunny ...
excuse me?
bunny lebowski ,
she is the light of my life .
are you surprised at my tears , sir?
fuckin 'a .
strong men also cry .
i received this fax this morning .
as you can see , it is a ransom note .
we have bunnie .
written by men who are unable to achieve on a level field of play .
gather one million dollars in unmarked , non consecutive twenties .
weaklings .
await instructions .
bums !
no funny stuff .
bummer .
this is a bummer , man .
that's , that's a bummer .
brandt will fill you in on the details .
mr. lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money .
why me , man?
he believes the culprits might be the very people who ... soiled your rug , and you're in a unique position to confirm or disconfirm that suspicion .
he thinks the carpet pissers did this?
well , dude , we just don't know .
fucking quintana .
that creep can roll , man .
yeah , but he's a pervert , dude .
no .
he's a sex offender with a record .
he did 6 months at chino for exposing himself to an 8 year old .
when he moved to hollywood ,
he had to go door to door to tell everyone he was a pederast .
what's a pederast , walter?
shut the fuck up , donny .
how much they give you?
20 grand , man .
and , of course , i still get to keep the rug .
just for making the hand off?
yeah .
they gave , dude a beeper .
now , so whenever these guys call
what if it's during a game?
oh , i told them if it was during league play ...
what's during league play?
life does not stop and start at your convenience , you miserable piece of shit .
i figure ...
what's wrong with walter , dude?
i figure it's easy money .
it's all pretty harmless .
she probably kidnapped herself .
what do you mean , dude?
rug pee ers did not do this .
look at it .
a young trophy wife marries this guy for his money .
she figures he isn't giving her enough .
you know , she owes money all over town .
that fuckin '...
bitch .
it's all goddamn fake , man .
it's like lenin said .
you look for the person who will benefit , and , you know ...
i am the walrus?
you know , you'll ...
you know what i'm trying to say .
i am the walrus .
that fuckin 'bitch !
i am the walrus .
shut the fuck up , donny !
v. i. lenin .
vladimir ilyich ulyanov !
what the fuck is he talking about?
fucking exactly what happened .
that makes me fucking sick .
what do you care , walter?
those rich fucks .
this whole fuckin 'thing .
i did not watch my buddies die facedown in the mud so that this fucking strumpet ,
this fucking whore
i don't see any connection to vietnam , man .
well , there's a literal connection .
no , walter , face it , there isn't any connection .
your roll .
have it your way , but my point is
your roll .
your roll .
my point is
are you ready to be fucked , man?
i see you roll your way into the semis .
dios mio , man .
liam and me , we're gonna fuck you up .
well ... you know , that's just like ...
your opinion , man .
let me tell you something , pendejo , you pull any crazy shit with us , you flash a piece out on the lanes ,
i'll take it away from you and stick it up your ass and pull the fuckin 'trigger till it goes click .
jesus .
you said it , man .
nobody fucks with the jesus .
8 year olds , dude .
# the man in me will do #

they called about 80 minutes ago .
they want you to take the money , drive north on the 405 .
they will call you on the portable phone with instructions in about 40 minutes .
one person only .
they were very clear on that ,
or i'd go with you .
one person only .
what happened to your jaw?
oh , nothin ', you know .
here's the money .
and the phone .
please , dude , follow whatever instructions they give .
all right .
her life is in your hands .
oh , man , don't say that .
mr. lebowski asked me to repeat that .
her life is in your hands .
oh , shit , man .
her life is in your hands , dude .
report back to us as soon as it's done .
where the fuck are you goin ', man?
take the ringer .
i'll drive .
what?
the what?
the ringer .
the ringer , dude .
have they called yet?
what the
what the hell is this?
my dirty undies , dude .
laundry .
the whites .
walter , i'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies , man .
that's right , dude .
the weight .
the ringer cannot look empty .
walter , what the fuck are you thinking , man?
you're right , dude .
i got to thinking .
i got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fuckin '20 grand
we?
what the fuck we?
you said you just wanted to come along .
my point , dude , is why should we settle for 20 grand when we can keep the entire million?
am i wrong?
yes , you're wrong .
this isn't a fuckin 'game , man .
oh , but it is a game .
you said so yourself .
she kidnapped herself .
i said i thought
dude here .
who is this?
dude the bagman , man .
where do you want us to go?
us?
yeah , you know , me and the driver .
i'm not handling the money , driving the car , and talking on the phone all by my
shut the fuck up !
dude , are you fuckin 'this up?
who is that?
that is the driver .
i told you
what the fuck's goin 'on?
walter !
what the fuck is goin 'on?
he hung up , man !
you fucked it up !
her life was in our hands , man .
easy , dude .
we're screwed now .
we don't get shit .
they're gonna kill her .
we're fucked , walter .
nothing is fucked , dude .
come on , you're being very un dude .
they'll call back .
look , she kidnapped
you see?
nothing's fucked here , dude .
nothing is fucked .
they're a bunch of fuckin 'amateurs !
hey , walter , will you just shut the fuck up?
don't say peep while i'm doin 'business here , man .
ok , dude , have it your way .
but they're amateurs .
ok , we proceed .
but only if there's no funny stuff .
so no funny stuff , ok?
just tell me where the fuck you want us to go .
that was the sign , man .
so all we gotta do is get her back ,
no one's in a position to complain ,
and we keep the baksheesh .
yeah , terrific , walter , but you haven't told me how we're gonna get her back .
where is she?
that's the simple part , dude .
we make the hand off ,
i grab one of 'em , beat it out of him .
yeah .
that's a great plan .
walter , that's fucking ingenious ,
if i understand it correctly .
it's a swiss fuckin 'watch .
that's right , dude .
the beauty of this is its simplicity .
once a plan gets too complex , everything can go wrong .
if there's one thing i learned in 'nam , it's
you're coming to a wooden bridge .
when you cross the bridge , you throw the bag from the left window of the moving car .
you're being watched .
what'd he say?
where's the hand off?
there is no fuckin 'hand off , man .
at the wooden bridge , we throw the money out of the car .
we throw the money out of the moving car .
no , we can't do that , dude .
that fucks up our plan .
well , call 'em up and explain it to them , walter .
your plan is so fuckin 'simple
i'm sure they'll fuckin 'understand it .
that's the beauty of it .
wooden bridge , huh?
i'm throwin 'the money , walter .
we're not fuckin 'around , man .
ok , dude , bridge is comin 'up .
give me the ringer , chop chop .
fuck that , walter .
i love ya , but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact you're a goddamn moron .
ok , dude .
no time to argue .
hey , man .
the bridge .
there goes the ringer !
what the fuck? !
here , dude , your wheel .
at 15 mph , i roll out .
i double back , grab one , and beat it out of him .
the uzi .
uzi? !
you didn't think i was rolling out of here naked?
walter , please ..
15 , dude .
this is it .
let's take that hill !
we have it !
we ... have it !
aw , fuck it , dude .
let's go bowling .
etz chaim he , dude , as the ex used to say .
what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
what the fuck are we gonna tell lebowski?
well , what exactly is the problem?
the problem is
what do you mean , what's the
there was no ...
we .. didn't ...
they're gonna kill that poor woman , man .
what the fuck are you talking about?
the poor woman that poor slut kidnapped herself .
come on , dude , you said so yourself .
man , i said i thought she kidnapped herself .
you're the one who's so fuckin 'certain .
that's right , dude .
100 % certain .
they posted the next round for the tournament .
donny , shut the fuck when do we play?
this saturday .
saturday?
well , they have to reschedule .
walter , what am i gonna tell lebowski?
i told that fuck down at the league office
who's in charge of scheduling?
i told that kraut a fuckin 'thousand times
i don't roll on shabbos .
he already walter posted it .
well , he can fuckin 'unpost it !
who gives a shit? !
they're gonna kill that poor woman , man .
what am i gonna tell lebowski? .. eventually she'll get tired of her little game and , you know , wander on back .
how come you don't roll on saturday , walter?
i'm shomer shabbos .
what's that , walter?
yeah , and in the meantime ,
what do i tell lebowski?
saturday , donny , is shabbos ,
the jewish day of rest .
that means i don't work ,
i don't drive a car , i don't fuckin 'ride in a car ,
i don't handle money , i don't turn on the oven , and i sure as shit don't fucking roll !
shomer shabbos !
shomer fucking shabbos .
oh , fuck !
that's it !
i'm outta here .
oh , come on , dude .
look , you just tell him
tell him we made the drop , and everything went , you know ...
oh , yeah , how'd it go?
went all right .
dude's car got a little dinged up .
walter , we didn't make the fuckin 'hand off , man .
they didn't get the fuckin 'money !
and they're gonna ..
they're gonna kill that poor woman .
they're gonna kill that poor woman
hey , walter , if you can't ride in a car , how do you get around on shammos?
really , dude , you surprise me .
they're not gonna kill shit , they're not gonna do shit .
what can they do to her?
they're a bunch of fuckin 'amateurs ,
and meanwhile , look at the bottom line .
who's sittin 'on a million fucking dollars?
who's got a fuckin 'million fuckin 'dollars sitting in the trunk of our car?
our car , walter?
and what do they got?
my dirty undies .
my fuckin 'whites .
say , dude .
where is your car?
who's got your undies , walter?
where's your car , dude?
you don't know , walter?
it was parked in a handicap zone .
perhaps they towed it .
you fuckin 'know it's been stolen .
well , certainly that's a possibility , dude .
oh , fuck it .
where you goin ', dude?
i'm goin 'home , donny .
phone's ringing , dude .
thank you , donny .
green .
some , brown or ...
rust coloration .
and was there anything of value in the car?
... a tape deck , some creedence tapes , and there was a ... my briefcase .
in the briefcase?
.. papers .
you know just papers .
you know , my papers .
business papers .
and what do you do , sir?
i'm unemployed .
my rug was also stolen .
your rug was in the car?
no , here .
separate incidents?
do you find them much , these stolen cars?
sometimes .
wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck , though .
or the creedence .
well , what about ...
the briefcase?
mr. lebowski , i'd like to see you .
call when you get home , and i'll send a car for you .
my name is maude lebowski .
i'm the one who took your rug .
guess we can close the file on that one .
el franco , ay`dame abajo .
i'll be with you in a moment , mr. lebowski .
does the female form make you uncomfortable , mr. lebowski? .. is that what this is a picture of?
in a sense , yes .
my art has been commended as being strongly vaginal , which bothers some men .
the word itself makes some men uncomfortable .
vagina .
oh , yeah?
yes , they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say , whereas without batting an eye , a man will refer to his dick or his rod
or his ...
johnson .
johnson?
all right , mr. lebowski .
let's get down to cases .
my father told me he agreed to let you have the rug , but as it was a gift from me to my late mother , it was not his to give .
your face .
as for this kidnapping ...
yes , i know all about it ,
and i know that you acted as courier .
let me tell you something .
the whole thing stinks to high heaven .
right , but let me explain something
about the rug .
do you like sex , mr. lebowski?
excuse me?
sex .
the physical act of love .
coitus .
do you like it?
i was talking about my rug .
you're not interested in sex?
you mean coitus?
i like it , too .
it's a male myth about feminists
that we hate sex .
it can be a natural , zesty enterprise .
however , there are some people
it is called satyriasis in men , nymphomania in women who engage in it compulsively and without joy .
oh , yes , mr. lebowski .
these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word .
our mutual acquaintance bunny is one of these .
listen , maude , um , i'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho , but , you know ,
i don't see what this has to do with ...
do you have any kahlua?
take 'a look at this , sir .
oh , i know that guy .
he's a nihilist .
hello .
meine dispatcher says there's something wrong mitt deine kable .
yeah , come on in .
i'm not really sure exactly what's really wrong with the cable .
zat's why they sent me .
i am an expert .
the tv's in here .
you recognize her , of course .
oh , that's my friend shari .
she just came over to use the shower .
the story is ludicrous .
meine nommen is karl .
ich bin expert .
you must be here to fix the cable .
lord , you can imagine where it goes from here .
he fixes the cable?
don't be fatuous , jeffrey .
little matter to me that this woman chose to pursue a career in pornography nor that she has been " banging " jackie treehorn , to use the parlance of our times , however ,
i am one of the 2 trustees of the lebowski foundation , the other being my father .
the foundation takes youngsters from watts and
shit , yeah , the achievers .
little lebowski urban achievers , yes , and proud we are of all of them ,
i asked my father about his withdrawal of $1 million from the foundation account , and he told me about this abduction .
but i tell you , it is preposterous .
this compulsive fornicator is taking my father for the proverbial ride .
yeah , but my
i'm getting to your rug .
my father and i don't get along .
he doesn't approve of my lifestyle , and , needless to say , i don't approve of his .
however , i hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter , so i'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to .
well , i could do that .
if you successfully do so , i will compensate you to the tune of 10 % of the recovered sum .
a hundred ...
thousand .
yes .
bones or clams or whatever you call them .
yeah , but ...
what about my ...
your rug , yes . well , with that money you can buy any number of rugs
that don't have sentimental value for me .
and i am sorry about that crack on the jaw .
oh , th that's fine .
that doesn't even ...
here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you .
you will receive no bill .
he's a good man , and thorough .
th that's thoughtful , but
please see him , jeffrey .
he's a good man , and thorough .
oh , well ...
all right .
all right .
so he says , " my wife's a pain in the ass .
she's always bustin 'my friggin 'agates .
my daughter's married to a real loser bastard , and i got a rash so bad on my ass
i can't even sit down .
but you know me , i can't complain .
ah , fuckin 'a , man .
i got a rash , man .
fuckin 'a .
i gotta tell you , tone , man ,
earlier in the day , i was really feeling shitty , man .
really down in the dumps .
lost a little money ...
hey , you know what? forget about it , huh?
forget about it .
yeah , fuck it , man .
i can't be worried about that shit .
life goes on , man .
home , sweet home , mr. l.
who's your friend in the volkswagen?
yeah , he followed us here .
when did he start foll
what the fuck? !
in the limo , you son of a bitch .
no arguing .
hey , careful , man . there's a beverage here .
start talking and talk fast , you lousy bum .
we've been frantically trying to reach you , dude .
where's my goddamn money , you bum? !
well , we ...
they did not receive the money , you nitwit !
they did not receive the money !
her life was in your hands !
this is our concern , dude .
no , man , nothing is fucked here .
nothing is fucked? !
the goddamn plane
has crashed into the mountain !
look , man , come on .
who are you gonna believe , those guys or ...
we dropped off the damn money .
we? !
the royal we .
you know , the editorial .
i dropped off the money exactly as per
look .
man , i've got certain information , all right?
certain things have come to light , and ...
you know , has it ever occurred to you that instead of , you know , running around , blaming me , given the nature of all this new shit , this could be a lot more , ... .. complex?
i mean , it might not be just such a simple ,
you know?
what in god's holy name
are you blathering about?
well , i'll tell you what i'm blathering about .
i've got information , man .
new shit has come to light .
and ... shit , man ...
she kidnapped herself .
well , sure , man .
look at it .
you know , a young trophy wife
in the parlance of our times , you know
she .. owes money all over town ,
including to known pornographers .
and that's cool . that that's cool .
i'm saying , she needs money , man .
and ... you know , of course they're gonna say they didn't get it , because she wants more , man .
she's gotta feed the monkey .
i mean ...
hasn't that ever occurred to you , man?
no , mr. lebowski , it had not occurred to me .
that had not occurred to us , dude .
well , ok , you know , you guys aren't privy to all the new shit , so ... .. you know .
but ... .. that's what you that's what you pay me for .
speaking of which , do you think that you could , give me my 20, 000 in cash?
my concern is .. and i gotta check with my accountant but this might bump me into a higher tax ,
brandt ...
give him the envelope .
oh , well , if you've already got the check made out ,
th that's cool .
we received this this morning .
since you have failed to achieve , even in the modest task which was your charge , since you have stolen my money , since you have unrepentantly betrayed my trust ...
i have no choice but to tell these bums to do whatever is necessary to recover their money from you , jeffrey lebowski .
and with brandt as my witness ,
any further harm visited upon bunny will be visited tenfold upon your head .
by god , sir , i will not abide another toe .
that wasn't her toe , dude .
whose toe was it , walter?
how the fuck should i know?
i do know that nothing about it indicates
man , the nail polish , walter .
fine , dude .
as if it's impossible to get some nail polish ,
apply it to someone else's toe .
someone else's
where the fuck are they gonna get
you want a toe?
i can get you a toe .
believe me , there are ways , dude .
you don't wanna know about it , believe me .
hell , i can get you a toe by 3 : 00 this afternoon , with nail polish .
these fuckin 'amateurs .
they send us a toe , we're supposed to shit ourselves with fear .
now , the point is
they're gonna kill her , walter ,
and then they're gonna kill me .
dude ...
that's ...
that's just the stress talking , man .
now so far we have what appears to me
to be a series of victimless crimes .
what about the toe?
forget about the fucking toe !
excuse me , sir ,
could you please keep your voices down?
this is a family restaurant .
oh , please , dear .
for your information , the supreme court has roundly rejected prior restraint !
walter , this is not a first amendment thing .
if you don't calm down ,
i'm gonna have to ask you to leave .
lady , i got buddies who died face down in the muck so you and i could enjoy this family restaurant !
all right , i'm outta here .
hey , dude , don't go away , man .
come on , this affects all of us , man .
our basic freedoms !
i'm stayin '.
i'm finishing my coffee .
enjoying my coffee .
thanks , man .
mr. lebowski , this is duty officer rolvaag of the lapd .
we've recovered your automobile .
it can be claimed at the north hollywood auto circus there on victory .
far out , man .
far fucking out !
this is a private residence , man .
ah , nice marmot .
ve vant the money , lebowski .
you think ve are kidding
or making with the funny stuff?
there are things you haven't dreamed of , lebowski .

he believes in nothing , lebowski , nothing . and tomorrow ve come back and ve cut off your chonson .
excuse me?
i said we'll cut off your johnson !

it was discovered last night in van nuys
lodged against an abutment .
oh , man , lodged where?
you're lucky she didn't get chopped ,
mr. lebowski .
must've been a joyride situation .
they abandoned the vehicle once they hit the retaining wall .
oh , my fucking briefcase !
man , it's not here .
shit !
yeah , i saw that on the report .
sorry .
you gotta get in on the other side .
the side view was found on the road by the car .
you're lucky they left the tape deck , though ,
and the creedence .
aw , jesus !
what's that smell , man?
probably a vagrant slept in the car or maybe just used it as a toilet and moved on .
are you gonna find these guys or , you know ,
i mean , you got any promising , uh , leads or ...
leads?
yeah .
sure .
i'll just check with the boys down at the crime lab .
they , got 4 more detectives
working on the case .
they got us working in shifts .
leads .
my only hope is that the big lebowski kills me
before the germans can cut my dick off .
now , that is just ridiculous , dude .
no one's going to cut your dick off .
thank you , walter .
not if i have anything to say about it .
thank you , walter .
that makes me feel very secure .
dude .
that makes me feel very warm inside .
now , dude .
this whole fuckin 'thing .
i could be sitting here with just pee stains on my rug .
yeah .
but , no , man , i gotta , you know .
fucking germans .
nothing changes .
fucking nazis .
they were nazis , dude?
oh , come on , donny .
they were threatening castration .
are we gonna split hairs here?
am i wrong?
well , he ..
they were nihilists , man .
they kept saying they believed in nothing .
nihilists .
fuck me .
i mean , say what you want about the tenets of national socialism , dude .
at least it's an ethos .
and also , let's not forget
let s not forget , dude
that keeping wildlife , um , an amphibious rodent for , um , you know , domestic ...
within the city ...
that ain't legal either .
what are you , a fucking park ranger now?
no , i'm just trying
who gives a shit about the fucking marmot?
we are sympathizing here , dude .
fuck sympathy .
i don't need your fucking sympathy , man .
i need my fucking johnson .
what do you need that for , dude?
you have got to buck up , man !
you cannot drag this negative energy
into the tournament .
fuck the tournament .
fuck you , walter .
