the mayor , thank you .

what am i?
thank you very much .
get used to it .
listen , great to see you .
ready?
i'm really appreciating that ...
look at you !
i remember you .
you're a lucky guy , denham .
am i a lucky guy?
maybe you're the lucky guy .
carl !
zelman !
i told you .
i know you did and i appreciate it .
let's get a shot of this .
come on .
big smile .
yeah !
that's great !
look at yourself .
look at what you've become .
no woman is worth this .
this woman is worth it .
i don't care what it takes , i gotta win her back .
oh , really?
she's not gonna buy this for a second .
shut up and hand me the grapefruit !
you're writing a comedy?
yes , i am .
i'm writing it for you .
why would you do that?
why would i write a play for you?
isn't it obvious?
oh , i'm sorry .
i couldn't help but overhear .
so , he took me to this fancy french restaurant ... and halfway through the hors d'oeuvres , he clutches my hand .
and that's when he told you how he felt?
no .
he never said it .
he never said it?
he probably thought he didn't need to say it .
well , then how does she know that it's real?
he said it was not about the words .
oh , please !
if you feel it , you say it .
it's really very simple .
he said we'd talk about it later .
only there was no later .
it never happened .
that's how it ended .
he just let you walk away?
he didn't try to save it?
i honestly believed things might actually work out ... which was really very ...
foolish .
men .
oh , they'll give you the world ... but they let the one thing that truly matters ... slip through their fingers .
typical .
they're so busy being brave , they forget to use their brains .
romance .
who needs it?
## [ orchestra playing ]
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
ladies and gentlemen ...
i'm here to tell you a very strange story .
the story of our adventure ... in which 17 of our party suffered horrible deaths ... their lives lost ... in pursuit of a savage beast ... a monstrous aberration of nature .
but even the meanest brute can be tamed .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , as you will see ... the beast was no match ... for the charms of a girl .
a girl from new york ... [ audience applauding ]
who melted his heart ... bringing to mind that old arabian proverb ...
and lo , the beast looked upon the face of beauty ... " and beauty stayed his hand .
and from that day forward , he was as one dead .
and now , ladies and gentlemen , i'm going to show you ... the greatest thing your eyes have ever beheld .
he was a king in the world he knew , but he comes to you now a captive .
ladies and gentlemen ...
i give you kong , the eighth wonder of the world !
## [ music playing ]
don't be alarmed .
it's perfectly safe .
these chains are made of chrome steel !
observe , if you will ...
i am touching the beast .
i am actually laying my hand on the 25 foot gorilla .
crank 'em up , fellas .
and now , we have in the auditorium tonight ... a surprise guest .
the real life hero of this story .
the man who hunted down the mighty kong !
the man who risked all to win the freedom of a helpless female .
a big hand for mr. bruce baxter !
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
## [ orchestral music playing ]
he was right .
about there still being some mystery left in this world ... and we can all have a piece of it ... for the price of an admission ticket .
that's the thing you come to learn about carl .
his unfailing ability to destroy the things he loves .
please remain calm , ladies and gentlemen ... for we now come to the climax of this savage ritual .
the sacrifice of a beautiful young girl .
behold her terror as she is offered up to the mighty kong !
a big hand , folks , for the bravest girl i've ever met !
miss ann darrow .
save me from the beast !
help me !
where is she?
where's ann?
i have no idea .
i heard he offered her all kinds of money and she turned him down flat .
# pack up all my cares and woe #
# here i go #
# singing low #
# bye bye #
# blackbird #
# where somebody waits for me #
# sugar's sweet #
# so is he #
# bye bye #
# blackbird ##
here's your story , boys .
beauty and the man who saved her from the beast .
no .
we have to get these people out of here .
everyone needs to leave , okay?
come on .
let him roar .
it makes a swell picture .
head for the exits .
get your own seat , buddy .
you're not having mine .
excuse me , fellows .
coming through .
coming through , fellows .
get me down !
help me , please !
somebody !
somebody help me !
go !

there they are .
go !
wait for me !
go back !
this way !
help !

taxi !
follow that ape .
come on , pal , we gotta draw him off .
it's all yours , buddy .
hey , get out of here , lady !
come on .
buddy !
come on .
come on .
look out .
jesus christ .
fire !
stop !

what's going on?

ann .
ann .
move along .
just one shot !
one shot !
come , come !
boys , how about a photo?
look at me .
come on , watch the camera .
come a little closer .
that's it , folks .
show's over .
step back !
clear the area .
that's it .
shove off , boys .
why'd he do that?
climb up there and get himself cornered .
the ape must have known what was coming .
he's just a dumb animal .
didn't know nothing .
what does it matter?
airplanes got him .
it wasn't the airplanes .
it was beauty killed the beast .
