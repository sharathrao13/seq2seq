don't get me wrong , but it always gets so ... complicated .
yesterday i went to grab a beer at a costumeparty .
i wanted to get to bed early .
i ended up having a few too many , but at least i got to bed early .
ln a sense .
my name is jacob , by the way .
i'm the one on the bottom .
the girl on top is called ...
hey .
hello?
i don't even know your name .
who cares !
excuse me ...
i know had something to do to day .
i was supposed to be ... in church .
at a christening .
my niece's !
shit !
i'm supposed to be her godfather !
i'm supposed to be at a christening .
i'm sorry , but women are lousy at handling rejection .
it's about being responsible .
i am a lawyer , after all .
the woman of my llfe
aren't we going inside?
we did .
and came back out .
was there a fire drill?
we're done .
it started at ten .
no godfather in the picture?
her godfather is in the picture .
these are my best friends .
tonje is my sister .
deep inside , i think she likes me .
but she equates being mature with always being on time .
her next baby is already due .
nine months and 15 minutes after stine .
tonje is very efficient .
fredrik doesn't mind .
he thinks everything tonje says is fine .
fredrik is the perfect family man .
veronica is a butterfly who brightens up wherever she lands .
lately she's been landing on me .
i have to remind her that we're just friends .
john is my best friend .
he may be blind , but he's the most clearsighted of us all .
and he's stine's godfather .
anne's dream is to find a partner .
her odds have increased greatly since she came out of the closet .
sorry , fredrik .
i'm serious .
i got lost .
you're unbelievable .
i won't even ask what her name was .
a little big?
at least it's better than that rabbit suit .
don't you look nice , jacob .
a little 1980s retro?
what's the matter with you?
i hurt my back .
is nothing sacred to you , jacob?
i had planned ...
a godfather supports and guides .
take a walk and calm her down .
any hot chicks here?
hi .
good?
it's a little dry .
do you have children?
no .
you view them as a reproduction of your own self complacency?
no .
i have yet to find the woman i want to have them with .
some may say that's a little premature .
these aren't my condoms .
i've just borrowed the suit .
want me to take her?
no , i'm fine .
who is that?
you don't have to sleep with every woman you meet , you know .
i don't believe in any " woman of my life .
the only ones who have succeeded at that , are you and tonje .
hi , jacob sand .
that was the minister of commerce from cameroon .
does your back hurt?
i just ... fell out of bed .
maybe you should see a doctor .
did you read about that guy who hit his leg?
the sore got in fected .
he ended up with gangrene .
gangrene?
he had to amputate his leg .
the infection paralyzed his speech center .
he hasn't said a word since .
240 kroner .
i can just get off here .
hello , hello , hello?
aren't you going to invite me up?
i am so incredibly tired .
i have had the day from hell .
and i would just make it worse?
veronica ...
would you like to come up?
veronica ...
i've started playing the sax .
i thought you played guitar .
no , guitar is so ...
but sax is raw and sexy .
turn off that music !
what about mountain climbing?
that wasn't for me .
but the sax is cool .
am i totally hopeless?
you aren't hopeless .
hi , ahmed .
sorry i'm so late .
hey , it worked out .
you are serious?
you kidding !
no , the fax came in today .
and they can all come to norway?
this is fantastic !
i cannot believe it !
careful .
i hurt my back .
sit down .
i know doctor .
this be very good .
fix everything .
you call .
say hello from me .
i'll call .
see you later .
jacob?
i have sister .
later , ahmed .
tomorrow .
later !
ok , later .
it seemed bigger .
are the rising mains new or old?
i didn't ask .
i just asked if there were rising mains .
this is so boring !
one sure sign that you're getting older ,
is that you go to more open houses than bars .
they've got a house and a kid .
all they're missing is a saab station wagon .
they have a saab station wagon .
jacob !
maria?
fred , this is my ... ex boyfriend , jacob .
fred .
jacob .
jacob?
you're the one with warts on your feet .
that didn't dare operate .
you always slept with your socks on .
i see you haven't changed .
i am very happy .
we are buying a house .
and you?
i met a mother of four .
we live in a big house with apple trees
and kids running around drinking juice .
like a classical painting .
you haven't matured at all .
we are leaving .
vamos !
cool uniform .
help for sore nipples
jacob sand?
dr. bomann can see you now .
your back?
yes .
many suffer from that .
you are in good hands now .
jacob sand is here .
nice to see you again .
likewise .
hey ...
i'm sorry about that commerce minister .
i hope you didn't ...
does your back hurt?
what?
yes , down here .
take your coat off , and i'll have a look .
there ...
pull your shirt up , so i can feel .
did you twist it somehow , or did it just happen?
i was lying down ...
and then i fell .
you fell while lying down?
yes .
legs together .
can you bend forward?
that hurts .
yes , a little bit .
you disappeared from the party .
i was just there as an interpreter .
lift your arms .
you speak cameroonian?
i speak one of 250 cameroonian dialects .
lift your leg .
and now the other leg .
there .
that's that .
are we done?
it's only muscular .
you'll be better in a few days .
aren't you going to take any ...
no tests , nothing?
not for your back .
but if you have anything else ...
i have been feeling listless lately .
do you have to take so many tests?
we've checked your heart , kidneys , blood pressure , and lungs .
are you all right?
i had forgotten why i never go to the doctor .
i took a urine sample .
i thought we could test your sperm .
test my sperm?
what if you meet the love of your life?
you can tell her you have top notch sperm .
you mean i have to ...?
do you sell houses?
how does that apply to my sperm?
it doesn't .
but you're a lawyer .
i work primarily with asylum seekers .
immigration law .
that's right .
too bad .
i'm considering selling mine .
oh , you mean real estate !
yes , that i do !
if you mean ...
is it a wooden house?
stone?
i do stone houses .
all kinds of real estate , actually .
you'll need this .
is it serious?
only if you fail to sell it .
here's my address .
hi .
hi .
i'm going out to dinner afterward .
come in .
there .
let's see ...
here is the sitting room .
i thought we could start with the first floor .
i see you work in the public sector .
this was dad's childhood home .
here is the sitting room , and pantry and kitchen .
are your parents alive?
almost too much .
dad just got a motorcycle , mom got a lover in crete .
good genes , i see .
and the rest of your family?
no nutcases or perverts?
i have an uncle who's a band leader .
that isn't lethal .
it is for your social life ....
this should be an easy sell .
here is the small library , the guest bathroom ...
when are you selling?
as soon as possible .
there is a bedroom , guest room ...
and if we continue over here ...
hello?
do you have kids?
this is my room .
is this yours?
yes .
this is where i grew up .
i had that same dollhouse .
girls had to play with cars and boys had to play with dolls .
so i had that same dollhouse .
but what have you done?
this isn't ...
you know that's the kitchen?
yes .
what is that double bed doing in there?
that's the kitchen .
they're sleeping in the kitchen .
so they can be next door to the baby .
my point is that you have too many kids .
you have five kids .
this is a mink's nest .
you've squeezed in kids all over .
there are five siblings .
five?
that's too many .
you have to have five .
the playroom is up here .
but they sleep down here .
the baby can get colicky .
he sleeps alone , so he doesn't wake the others .
you actually live in here .
let's continue .
then we went into her room .
it was so ...
magical .
yes , but john ...
she's stunning !
she's your client .
i'm her patient .
i thought you feared doctors .
i've never met a woman like this who immediately ...
jacob ...
yes?
are you going back to her house?
yes .
why?
i'm going with you .
you can't do this on your own .
of course i can .
i'm a specialist in property law .
you don't understand this .
i shouldn't have mentioned her .
it's about understanding people .
it's about selling .
john , you're blind .
jacob , you're prejudiced .
i can always call her my self .
remember what we agreed on?
i won't speak until spoken to .
hi .
hi .
i brought john .
thought it would be good to get his opinion .
as far as the sales strategy goes , and how to prepare ...
that's nice .
come in .
nina .
john .
i've heard so much about you .
i've been telling him about the house .
john has vast experience ... with houses like this .
beautiful .
let's start with the first floor .
are you aware that jacob is head over heels in love with you?
he didn't dare come alone .
you may be his dream woman .
i've never seen him like this .
how was he before?
he tended to bring out strong maternal feelings in women .
i can imagine .
you underestimate yourself , jacob .
behind that pretty face lie vast amounts of hidden philosophy .
he has wanted to ask you something , but hasn't dared .
he wants to ask you out on a date .
ok ...
i'll call you .
this went great , jacob .
nothing to worry about at all .
i hate the saxophone !
i hate jan gar fucking barek !
what happened?
i feel like a satellite dish sucking in signals .
why doesn't anyone want me?
plenty of people want you .
you don't .
you just sleep with me .
hey ...
maybe we should stop doing that .
have you met someone else?
why do you ask?
why else would you stop sleeping with me?
it's just inevitable that one of us will get hurt .
you have met someone else .
veronica ...
why make all these demands that we can never fulfil , jacob?
imagine if we could just ... be , and be satisfied with that .
imagine how wonderful that would be .
turn off that music !
you owe me a new broom !
cheers !
happy birthday , john .
thank you for coming .
hello?
what's this?
a present from me .
you're so sweet .
it's ...
glasses !
look at those !
are they nice?
plenty of room for your nose .
cheers !
dear john , happy birthday .
marte and i , we ...
we have some news as our present for you .
we are getting married .
married?
congratulations !
when?
in august .
that's wonderful !
but you've only just met .
and now you're getting married?
yes .
i just think it's a little early .
only three of us left .
don't look at me .
what about you , jacob?
jacob will search till he's 100 .
no , jacob has been showing an interest in female doctors lately .
with his fear of doctors?
he has a new " family doctor .
sometimes i wonder what you think with .
now what?
what do you think?
are you doing veronica?
we're just good friends .
you don't sleep with your friends !
thank you , john .
you may want to straighten out your social antennas a little bit .
sorry .
veronica will be fine .
so will you .
i'm more concerned about tonje and fredrik .
they're filing for separation .
at least , they have the paperwork .
but they're planning to ... buy a house and have another kid .
heard anything from nina?
thought i'd send her an e mail .
what are you going to write?
that i think about her all the time .
is that wrong?
no .
no , jacob .
that's just fine .
why didn't you say anything?
why should i say anything?
you're supposed to tell me things like that .
she feels i lack ambition .
you aren't staying home forever .
the problem is , i don't know what i want .
i don't want to be a career lawyer like tonje .
you don't have to work as a lawyer .
i am a fourth generation supreme court advocate .
i want to write books .
be an author .
so write books .
i've already submitted one to a publisher .
but writing isn't a real job .
is that what tonje says?
not in words .
hello?
hi .
now?
i can be there in ten minutes .
that was the doctor's office .
my test results are in .
they want me there .
jacob sand is here .
hi .
what is it?
won't you have a seat?
is something wrong?
jacob ...
you are fine .
there was nothing wrong with your tests .
i'm sorry .
that's ok .
i just wanted to see you again .
i have the rest of the day off .
want to do something?
i'd love to .
let's go in here .
here?
a karaoke bar?
want a beer?
two beers .
i think this one should be good ...
good morning .
sleep well?
are you already up?
i have to go shopping .
i need to find a children's store .
why?
is that so strange?
you haven't asked if i use birth control .
hey ...
are you ...?
do you know ...?
isn't that what you want?
relax .
a colleague just had a baby .
jacob !
have you ever seen anything so tiny?
or so expensive?
it costs a fortune .
don't you like children?
why do you ask?
it doesn't seem like it .
i'm crazy about kids .
i'm serious .
why wait?
because we've only known eachother for a month .
so?
i've found the man of my life .
i have a good education , a good job , a good income .
now i want a baby .
do we have time to eat first?
when is a good time?
more women now use foreign sperm banks to become pregnant .
hello?
here .
can you baby sit tonight?
me?
we've been invited to a gala and our babysitter backed out .
i promised to help john get anne's wedding present .
you are ... were almost her godfather .
i don't know the first thing about kids .
this is the front , this is the back .
instructions are under her feet .
can't anyone else?
i've called everyone but the salvation army .
i can call them .
you owe me .
hi .
can you baby sit?
sure .
come in .
are you sure?
i'd love to do it my self .
if you have plans , you have plans .
hello?
yes .
can you hold her for a second?
i'm on my way .
ten minutes .
i'm sorry .
go .
leave us girls alone .
are you sure it's all right?
i won't be late .
is anything happening?
don't scare them .
i'm not .
getting any?
they're just eating .
you said they'd go to sleep .
they will .
there's enough sleeping medicine in that bread to knock out duckburg .
why are you so late?
you take over .
i'm bored .
can't we just buy a present?
you know anne loves duck .
to eat .
she may not want them as pets .
there's none left .
so knock their heads against a tree .
how are things going , jacob?
how's it going with the woman of your life?
great .
i've never been so in love before .
this is the first time ...
what's going on?
i don't know .
hello?
yoga .
to counteract stress .
veronica , if it gets too bad , you can just marry me .
what's going on here?
don't tell me you've hypnotized them to lie like that .
bring the car down to the river .
well done , jacob !
nice of you to show up .
don't say anything .
it would just sound stupid .
i'm going to bed .
good night .
hi , this is nina bomann .
leave a message after the tone .
nina?
nina?
i'm so sorry about what happened yesterday .
it has nothing to do with that , jacob .
please .
what is it?
this just won't work .
what won't work?
we want different things out of life , jacob .
i want you .
we can have kids .
i'm serious .
i'm having you arrested !
that'll teach you !
have you talked to her?
are you really in love with her?
john ...
if you are , it doesn't matter what she said .
she broke up with me .
those are just words .
words?
you have to fight !
show her she's special .
buy a full page ad , buy a flower shop , go on a hunger strike .
do something active .
dare something !
jacob , for the first time in your life you're in love .
you can't come in here .
i want to see nina .
she quit last friday .
you expect me to believe that?
sorry ...
happy?
did she leave a forwarding address?
you know that information is confidential .
hello?
you moved some things for nina bomann .
finally , there you are !
this will be a fun starting point ...
we thought you had changed your mind .
i'm auntie crazy .
don't take that literally .
what's your sign?
virgo .
expect me to believe that?
well , we have a job to do !
entr !
you can undress over there to the right .
undress?
we are all too inhibited .
hung up in conventions , in squares .
we have to let go .
we must .
let go !
my first orgasm was incredible .
do you masturbate often?
you should .
let's see .
how do you like to pose?
frontal , or from the rear?
whatever you prefer .
i'm here to talk to nina .
you're jacob .
then we want a poem .
recite a poem .
a poem?
a poem .
let it out .
release the poem , jacob .
about the woman you love .
she's like a boat on the ocean .
her head is full of notions .
her heart , warm with emotion .
for how things should be .
why are you staring at me?
this is bullshit !
wait .
is nina here?
do you know where she is?
i can't tell you .
why can't i talk to her?
have i done something wrong?
she's pregnant .
maybe she needs time to think .
why would she need that?
maybe the thought of you as a father , frightens her .
she can't just run away .
i didn't think you wanted kids .
relax , jacob .
she'll be back .
now it's anne's turn to get married .
hurrah !
do you take anne grom to be your lawful partner?
i do .
do you , anne grom , take marte sundt bull to be your lawful partner?
i do .
since you have agreed to enter into a partnership ,
i pronounce this partnership lawfully registered .
go ahead .
hi !
how are you doing?
i'm completely ...
i'm completely out of it .
it'll all work out .
when you come home , i'm sure she'll be back .
what happened with you and me ...
i feel very guilty .
i am so sorry .
it was just as much my fault .
you know that .
who knows?
maybe i'm finally open for the man of my life .
you deserve it .
this is the craziest wedding i have ever been to .
to you this must be a veritable orgy .
why does everyone say that?
because you have become a boring , predictable ,
self centered and self righteous cunt of a lawyer !
i'm going to be a mommy .
and i'll be a mother .
next time i'll be mommy .
and i'll be mother .
what about the father?
i'm sure he'd be as thrilled as us , if he only knew !
she's a lesbian !
most of the women here are .
nina !
she knew i was a lawyer , asked me about my family ,
had me take tests , checked for diseases ...
that's why she wanted to test my sperm !
she drained me like a billy goat !
jacob , this is crazy .
she used me like a bull .
i might as well have given it to her in a cup .
i want custody .
takes more than buying clothes .
i can take classes .
you plan to breast feed?
there is something called infant formula .
jacob ...
what makes you think the baby will be better off with you?
i don't want the baby to grow up with a ...
with a mother like that .
ok .
how warm is the formula supposed to be?
i can learn !
is it supposed to look like that?
did you think she ate with a knife and fork?
there you go .
now let's burp .
come to daddy .
can you hold her?
is she supposed to smell like this?
oh no !
that's the sixth time today .
did you go poopie again?
hold this .
where are you going?
to buy diapers .
now?
if she keeps crying , just thump her on the floor .
no wonder you were so upset .
your diaper was full of poop .
what kind of daddy do you have?
tonje and i went to see a marriage counselor .
the counselor talked about openness and communication .
what happened?
what do you think?
we started arguing .
eventually she left .
tonje?
no .
the counselor .
then what happened?
we went home too .
and when we got home things were ... so quiet .
stine was at my mother's .
it's crazy .
i hardly recognize her .
she has gone through such a change .
all we do is ...
tonje?
oh yes !
are you happy now?
you don't think i know about that lesbo stuff?
you'll make a great family !
what are you talking about?
i've seen what you're up to .
you can't fool me !
this is petter .
i don't think you've met .
he's my ex husband .
sell now .
it's a great opportunity .
you've already sold it?
i told you to wait till it hit 43 !
how are you doing?
i'm doing fucking great !
i had planned to tell you .
i just needed some time to decide what to do .
you needed some time?
what about my rights?
the baby isn't yours .
can i come in?
what happened to uniform boy?
we broke up .
he could never love me .
all i want is a life .
why can't i get a life?
why did we break up?
because you left me .
you made me leave .
i did?
you did not love me .
sure i did .
you never said so .
and you had stopped touching me .
i didn't think you wanted me to .
there was nothing i wanted more .
then why did you sleep on the couch?
dearest jacob ...
if only you knew how much i loved you .
we could have been so happy .
could have had a big family .
what is this?
i thought i was going to be a dad .
you don't want children with me ,
but as soon as you meet someone else , you make her pregnant?
i was tricked .
i thought i was tricked .
oh , jacob ...
you always let yourself be used .
you have to learn to set limits .
we can have children !
turn down that music !
why did you sleep out here?
i've been thinking .
let's try again .
i can move in , and we can fix up this place together .
it will be fantstico !
this couch ... has to go .
hi .
can we talk?
i came to apologize .
i had hoped you'd find out some other way .
i'm the one that should apologize .
no .
i should .
if you still think i'm in love with my aunt ...
if i had known i was pregnant ,
i never would have gotten involved with you like that .
i miss you .
are you coming?
nina?
nina !
it isn't what you think .
what is it?
she's my ex .
she just became single .
that's why she's walking around naked in your apartment?
what about your ex?
petter?
i wouldn't touch him with a ten foot pole !
we want nothing to do with each other .
we had just signed our divorce papers .
nina ...
there must be something i can do .
i've never felt this way before .
we had our chance .
i simply cannot decide .
we don't have much time .
did you ask about the rising mains?
she couldn't find them .
couldn't find the rising mains?
don't yell at me !
she's the specialist .
have you heard from her , jacob?
no .
she's having a baby with another man .
maybe she'll come back to you .
why would she do that?
because she loves you .
that was beautifully put , veronica .
what?
what you just said .
that was incredibly beautiful .
will you marry me?
let's go .
i know i'm an arrogant bastard , but ...
i love you .
i know .
it's so obvious .
i must have been blind not to see it .
you're the woman of my life .
you're who i dream of .
john ...
veronica , will you marry me?
will you marry me?
yes .
of course .
i've never understood why women like to look at baby clothes .
but now i think it's ... great .
why do you think she came to you?
why did she react like that when she saw maria?
she wants you back .
i screwed up .
i know when it's over .
you know nothing .
you love her .
you have to fight .
she wants you to show yourself as the man she hopes you are .
i'm lost .
that's the problem .
you aren't .
just don't give up .
i heard rumors that you hung your lawyer's robe in the closet .
watch out for the curb .
fredrik and i made a deal .
he can write ,
and i turned down the partnership in my firm .
great .
i thought that was what you wanted .
i wanted more fredrik and he wanted more of me .
did you know he wrote a novel while stine slept?
of course .
how's the yoga going?
i quit .
quit?
what are you doing now?
nothing .
it's enough to share a bottle of wine with john .
the water broke .
get me to the hospital .
now?
yes .
find a car !
a taxi !
i'll get fredrik .
we don't have time !
get a taxi !
they won't stop !
this woman is having a baby .
can you drive her to the nearest clinic?
i'm a little busy right now .
hurry !
is it real important?
hurry up , guys .
i hate to be difficult , but ...
go !
can't you go any faster?
this is fun !
my day just took a turn for the better .
careful !
can't you slow down a little?
try to wait .
i can't exactly hold it in !
careful with that wreath .
someone's supposed to mourn over it later .
oh my god !
drive !
i've dreamt of doing this for over ten years .
you're on the sidewalk .
you see him , right?
i had a whole funeral procession behind me .
i must have lost them .
so what ...
they know where to go .
you're at the wrong entrance .
good luck .
thanks for the ride .
now i need to find nordberg chapel from here .
where might that be?
fredrik isn't answering .
then leave a message !
where are you going?
i ...
you can't leave now .
this will go just fine .
breathe deeply , like you did at childbirth class .
come over here .
breathe easy .
and push !
great !
come on .
we'll let you cut the umbilical cord .
come on !
here it is !
