the dream ... ... always ends there
box
you still don't trust me , do you?
the box is too small ...
i can't breathe
i finished it
thank you very much
i'll go to the office and read it over
your handwriting is almost as neat as typing
i don't mean it should be typed , either
i have to write by hand
i can't type ...
you're left handed , aren't you?
i've read so many manuscripts
i can tell
i'll be in touch then ...
one thing ...
i mean ...
your novels are doing very well
here , a small token
sis '?
sister , dear?
it's you , isn't it?
it's me
kyoko ...
say something
sister !
it's hot ...
i'm burning ...
it wasn't what you think !
it really wasn't !
it wasn't !
shoko ... ... you did well today
a little reward
keep up the good work
kyoko , keep trying !
you'll be rewarded too
sensei
i was looking ... ... looking for someone
someone?
who is it?
can't i be him?
at least ... ... i'm here for you
you do look like him
bear it for one night
i want to be you ... ... to sleep like you ... to have nice dreams
what's going on?
shoko , don't worry
shoko ...
sister ...
i'm sorry
i didn't do it out of hatred
it wasn't the necklace , either
i loved you so much , sis '
i looked for you everywhere
it's true
i loved you more than anyone in the world
more than anyone
help me ...
so beautiful
i can't decide ... which one of you is more beautiful ...
... shoko back then or you right now?
oh , kyoko ...
why did you do it?
don't ...
you thought i only loved your sister?
poor thing ...
the heat was unbearable ...
don't !
she couldn't get out ...
she's trapped ... don't !
in that tiny box !
look
look !
if you hadn't done it , she'd be here now !
i'm sorry ...
i'm sorry
i'm so sorry ...
i saved one for you too
can't have one without the other
shoko and kyoko ...
together , a perfect pair
you're one and the same to me
the dream ... ... always ends just there
good morning
good morning
in reality ... ... we've been together since birth
i had a weird dream
me too
but then ... our dreams ... ... differ slightly
mrs. li?
you're so beautiful
they say your dumplings are the most expensive
of course !
please come in
you've come in the right time !
the water is just boiling , waiting for you
actually , i know who you are
i watched you on tv very often when i first came to hong kong
you were the best !
i quit acting a long time ago
please , have a seat
mrs. li , guess how old i am
i suppose ... ... you're in your thirties at most
i'm much older than that ; everyone calls me aunt mei
but you don't have any wrinkles
and i have fair skin , too
i'm my own best advertisement
your skin is great ; i'm impressed
my dumplings are worth it
you get what you pay for
mrs. li ...
want me to put in more cabbage?
it's up to you
the northerners always say ...
good feeling comes from a nap , good taste comes from a dumpling
dumplings have existed in china for more than 1400 years
but the southerners still say ... ... they're just dough stuffed with meat , nothing special !
i use high gluten flour ... ... for texture and chewiness
i knead it fine ... ... until it is like a peeled egg
smooth , translucent , and soft
there's a secret to keep the filling from leaking out
so that the juicy flavor explodes in the mouth
eat while it's warm
i eat these often
sometimes in soup ... ... sometimes minced and steamed with citrus peel
just think of the results , not what it was
for women to rejuvenate ... ... you must start from the inside for the best result
only my secret formula can do this
let me sing for you
well , it's kind of a custom of mine
i often sing songs from my youth after my customers eat
the water of hung lake is rough
my home is on the shore
at dawn , boats go out with nets
at dusk , they return loaded with fish
wild ducks and lotus roots are here
autumns are bountiful with rice
they say heaven is beautiful
how can it compare with hung lake
you were already on a trip last week
you promised to stay for our 15th anniversary
i'm just going for a few days
i'll try to come back early
it's boring here in the hotel
we'll move into our new home as soon as the renovation is over
see if there's anything else we need in the new house
so many " zeroes "?
you used to laugh a lot
now even a big fat check can't make you happy
you're not taking me along
why should i be happy?
i'll be gone for only 4 , 5 days
and if more?
i'll write you another check as a fine
fines are for mistakes
whatever
about that contract , if you don't send over soon ... ... i'm going to change my mind
shenzhen , china
i went through so much to get these
they're stepping up the surveillance because some paparazzi have come
hong kong media is so nosy
just don't show up in the next two weeks
even the locals can't get a hold of the stock now
we'll see
thanks this is for you
china hong kong border
this way , miss
this way , miss
put it through over there?
the lunchbox okay
mrs. li
ever consider having children?
we just can't ; don't know if it's his problem or mine ...
don't worry , you'll soon regain your youth ... ... so as the heart of your man
do you have more potent stuff for faster results?
the best are those in the 5th or 6th month
have to remove it only by breaking the water sac , then sliding it out
it's covered by a layer of creamy fat
the colors are defined ; you can even see the cranium
its tiny limbs would still be moving around
it's only this small in the 1st trimester
but the meat would be too tough by the third trimester
the 5th month ones are perfect , kitten like
so cute and so nutritious
let me show you
i'm serving it pan fried this time
we can always try some other styles next time
what's this crunchiness about?
it's okay , they have hands and feet already , you know
and ears , too !
those were bones?
nah ... their bones are hardly hard
i'll just chop finer next time
simmer in broth next time ; taste less greasy
broth is good ; it keeps all the juices
are you done?
this can't go on
pardon?
my skin is still flabby
no !
it's much better !
i need your most potent stuff
trust me , i'll find it
it's time for me to sing
suit yourself , but i must go
bye , mrs. li
this way !
don't worry , i'll find it for you
call me when you do
trust me
aunt mei?
you are ...
i'm a friend of mrs. kam
oh , hello dear , c'mon in !
from now on , you don't have to work anymore
and live off you?
i can afford that , given you're so slim and eat so little
not true ; i love to eat and you love to laugh , too
relax
you're almost there ; it's been 18 hours already
relax
you must try to relax , dear
will she be all right?
of course
try to relax
your cervix has not fully dilated yet
poor girl , you're not even fully grown
we women must protect ourselves
don't let others bully you again
the water broke !
it's okay
don't be nervous
i swear it will be over in 10 seconds
breathe deeply !
work with me , okay?
relax
hold on ...
relax ...
cry if you want to
it's fully dilated !
stay calm !
and on my count ...
one , two , three !
where are my tongs?
relax !
try to relax
beautiful
don't be sad , my dear
there's no more life in this baby
want some snacks?
i'll do steamed dumplings this time
need some wine , too
it was a boy
a boy?
see that little thing?
so beautiful and rare
boys don't get aborted in china
i didn't use any oxytocin , just a catheter
drugs make it inedible
it will damage your nervous system
it's a first born , the most nutritious
nothing in this world can beat this nutrition
the mother's a schoolgirl
young and healthy
then get working !
what's the style today?
this will make you feel like new
hello?
my husband broke his leg
now you need me
normally you wouldn't care where i go
you smell nice ...
... look nice
you haven't touched me in ages
thirsty?
i'll get water
it's so hot in the street
and we must go to mongkok next
darn !
i forgot about that
two more trunks to move
woe is me big trunks , too
what's wrong?
what is this?
what is it?
it's blood my goodness !
here's a tissue
whose blood is this? !
kate?
are you all right?
kate ...
what's going on? !
answer me , kate !
answer me !
kate?
are you all right?
what's going on? !
something is going on here
she must have taken something definitely
mrs. li
you look fabulous !
absolutely radiant !
talking behind my back?
no !
just praising your look
i'll catch up later
you're so late ...
perhaps she finds herself a guru
or better , " voodoo
that's scary !
mrs. li , stop busying yourself , join us
bon appetite thanks
the food smells kind of fishy
yes
is it the beef?
the beef?
it's the fish , i think
really?
i don't think so
there is a strange smell here
something wrong with the food?
god , the smell is horrible
i've forgot to check something !
excuse me
why is she so tense?
aunt mei?
what was this " best stuff "?
what did you feed me?
the fetus was sick , wasn't it?
or , poisonous?
this baby was hard to find
available only because his father is also his grandfather
one in a million , you know
a child of an incest?
a cursed child turns me to this? !
a cursed child has extra potency , i tell you
hey !
mrs. li , hurry !
turn on the tv !
channel 2 is rerunning your series !
heard you have a crush on the baby face next door
no ...
" you sure? " " no ...
the one you said looks like alan tam
i never said so !
mrs. li , you crying?
don't be sad ; be strong
good night , mrs. li
headaches?
and rashes?
it's just nerves !
you should be happy instead !
you're 2 months pregnant !
we've confirmed it
you sure?
absolutely
peter , you told me i couldn't conceive !
not anymore !
now you can !
you sure there's no mistake not a chance
this is the best news for both mr li and you !
i'll prescribe something to ease your tension
you'll be fine in a couple of days
nurse yes , dr. wong
mrs. li's chauffeur will come pick up her medication
how many days 'prescription?
give her a week's worth okay
don't move !
dispatch , we've arrived at 2103

shenzhen , china

hello?
just a minute
there , alright

i was just having dinner

i can't finish it
yeah , i've left it frozen
my stomach doesn't feel so good
anyway ...
it's been 3 months since i moved here , aren't you going to come over?
how about tomorrow?
we can have breakfast together ... ... if you don't mind cold leftovers
you really want to hear me play?
my stomach is really bothering me !
i feel nauseous !
perhaps the food is past its expiration date
darling , it's killing me !
and ...
what's scene 29 again?
good bye , sir good bye !
scene 29 is where young chae draws blood with a water pump
right ...
good bye , sir !
good bye !
if we push it back to the 13th ...
shoot the remaining inserts during the morning of the 8th ... ... and i'll finish editing before the night shoot
then the crew can catch some sleep in between
but you won't get any sleep at all !
better just one , than all sixty of the crew losing sleep
quite true
take care , sir !
yeah , you too !
kyung ah , get the guys to do the heavy work !
i heard you're going to seoul
could you drop me off at hanam city?
good bye , sir !
good bye !
good bye , sir !
good bye !
sir ... the daggers we talked about
good work !
good work everyone !
i ran over from studio 3 as soon as i heard you're here
did you read the scripts i sent you?
what do you think?
which one should i do?
pink panty " , go for " pink panty
they say director jang is the john waters of korea
still ... don't you think his film is a little sinister?
kim chang's film seems better director kim chang ...
his film only makes the director look good
the actors don't get noticed at all
just don't waste your time on him
what about this ...
trying something other than mr. nice guy?
like a psycho rapist killer thing ... huh? !
huh? !
don't worry , i ate already ...
just go back to your work
we can have breakfast together tomorrow
i'll take care of it if you don't mind cold leftovers
you should have come to see the set !
it looks just like our house ...
hey , i got the music for the film !
listen to this ...
the rehearsal will end late !
don't forget your veggie diet !
you've got ... ... such pretty hands , ma'am
there's jewelry in the bedroom !
take it all !
just don't hurt anyone !
please , let us go !
darn ...
you're not supposed to start off with this kind of talk !
you shouldn't have started begging until ... like 20 minutes later
wait " ... till things fall apart first !
you are , after all , the head of the house
if you're only capable of " begging " from the onset ... ... who else could your wife count on?
remember what happened when you shot " uninvited guest " in 1998?
when those gangsters busted in on the shoot ...
stop it !
you shouted at them boldly !
what happened to your guts now?
who are you?
who , me?
maybe you'll recognize me like this ...
nope?
red hunt !
huh?
water !
water !
water ...
what the hell !
ready , huh? !
action , huh?
and ...
cut !
she's a pianist ...
i know that of course !
i've done my research
got to be the pianist's fingers for the " cut " to mean something
only an idiot would want her toes instead !
honey !
honey , i'll ... take care of this somehow
honey , are you alright?
it hurts a lot , doesn't it?
i still don't know what's going on ...
but i'm sure ... we can get out of this somehow
just trust me , okay?
does it hurt a lot , honey?
try and bear it a little longer !
do that for me , okay?
it will be all over soon
i'll ...
i'll make sure you can play again
i love you , honey
let's be strong
one way or another , i'll ...
i remember you now !
yeah?
an extra
i was in all five of your films , sir !
you were such a kind man ... ... unlike any other directors i've ever worked with
so kind , no matter what mistakes i made
remember the mob scene in " the desert "?
you were shooting the crowd running in the distance
some moron knocked over a hornet's nest as we ran
i got stung , i freaked out and i ruined the take
naturally ...
the damn assistant director gave me hell
but then you said ...
how about using the time to set up another take instead of yelling?
it's not like he wanted to get stung
is your neck okay?
you were so sweet
but what's the use of all that?
you don't even recognize me !
why are you doing this to me?
what do you mean " why "?
because " this world is so fucked up !
that's why !
look at this , look !
i didn't even know there are houses like this in korea !
lots of people are better off than us !
this house is merely ...
the rich people i've ever met ...
they're all scumbags , no respect for people
i don't even consider them as human beings
but you , you are a good man !
that's so fucking unfair !
you're rich , handsome , educated in america ... ... a genius director , and you have a pretty wife !
if you're also a " good " man on top of that ... ... what are guys like me supposed to get? !
you know on tv shows ...
only the poor folks are good people !
never the rich !
you've already got everything !
why do you have to corner us too? !
why are you a good man , too?
you live well in this world and you'll live well in heaven
our lives suck and we're going to hell !
this is totally outrageous !
that's not true
it's harder for a rich man to get into heaven ...
... than a camel to go through the eye of a needle
it's in the bible !
bull shit
it's easier for a rich man to get into heaven ... ... than putting a needle into a camel's nostril !
face it , you've got no cause to sin
of course i have
then , prove it !
what persistence
i'm sorry ...
... for being a good person look at that !
look !
what a good man? !
i can let your wife go
on one condition ...
you have to kill someone right here !
can you do that?
i'll do as you wish
let her go and i'll die in her place
you don't need to die
you just need to strangle the little kid over there
if you don't , in every five minutes ... ... i'll cut off another one of your wife's fingers
let's see how good you can stay !
ready ...
go !
who is this kid?
i don't know her either !
met her on my way here !
she looked bored so i brought her along
guess what
i've been dirt poor ever since i was a kid
my bastard father was always dead drunk
he beat the hell out of us day in and day out
needless to say my grades were bad
and this ugly face of mine could get me nowhere near stardom
so you see , now i'm the one who always gets drunk
i go home and i kick my boy's ass
and , i beat my wife , too !
when i sober up in the morning ... ... and see that beat up face of hers
guess what i think of?
your face !
your nice handsome face overlapping hers ...
it makes perfect sense for a poor kid to grow up to be a bastard ... ... and a rich kid to grow up to be a good man !
that's fate !
damn it !
hell , no !
no ...
time flies
what should i do , honey?
whatever you say
should i kill her?
don't kill her?
what a decisive man , my goodness !
what a decisive man !
listen to me , life has many stages
i went through many difficulties before getting this far
it wasn't as easy as you think !
i didn't get it for free
someone once said ...
no time to blink , keep striving for ...
fuck that !
i ain't stupid !
it's a line from your own film !
jin says that to rose in " last wish
want me to follow suit?
remember the cabaret scene in " dancing factory "?
you wrote the song lyrics as well
i did some dancing there , too
i'm not going to listen to your words anymore
all are a pack of lies !
all out of hypocrisy !
we'll make our own words
we'll make our own truth
i'm not going to listen to your words anymore
i'm sorry little one
i really can't hold out
i'm sorry !
i ain't a good man ...
you don't even know me !
how can you prove that i'm a good man !
the truth is ...
whenever an actor ask for my advice
i always persuade them not to work with director kim chang
because ...
he's my sole rival
i can't stand that jerk having any good actors in his films
you call this shit a confession?
do i look like an idiot to you?
i've never said that you were a saint !
who the hell hasn't done a thing as tedious as that?
give me a break
let me show you what a confession really is
for example
before i left home this morning , i killed my wife
i must have strangled her for over 30 minutes
her tongue hung out all the way and she shitted everywhere
i was going to finish my son too , but it was not that easy ...
i just couldn't do that ...
now , that's what i call a confession !
your turn !
give me something nice and juicy
wait !
i'll talk !
i'll talk !
there's a wardrobe called kyung ah
i offered to give her a ride home one day
i lied that her home was on my way
and then i drove her to a motel ...
we've been doing this for 3 years already since " bluebird
love isn't a sin
we dropped by a motel tonight , too
lakeside motel , room 304
we did it twice in three hours ...
no ... three times in two hours
i'm really sorry , honey
shouldn't have told you this when you're already suffering so much
it hurts a lot , doesn't it?
but then ...
you shouldn't mind this
you've never had any real pains in your life , and no worries either
know why i like kyung ah?
unlike you , she's smart and we can talk about many things
as for you , i'd rather you not to talk to me at all
all you care to talk about are clothes and plastic surgery !
when i make love to you ...
i'm not sure whether i'm holding a woman or a bag of silicon
guess how old my wife is
just one year younger than me ... ... but already a botox junkie
now her expression doesn't change even if she smiles
what she has is not a face but a mask
and that mask yelps at me everyday
i love you , honey !
mi ran , be honest for just this once in your life
do you know what love is?
don't pity yourself for losing your fingers
they don't deserve any tears
because you can play shit
plus , you don't cook and you never clean ...
you hands have no use anyway other than wearing jewelry
listen
what is an artist without talent?
nada
not existing !
a " nothing
like a ring without a hole or a square ball !
get it?
if you can't play , it'll be nice and quiet here
also ...
it's so much lighter for you to wave " bye bye " !
no , no , no , not yet
there's something else i've been trying to say ...
i've been holding it back for a whole 10 years now
curious?
screw you , bitch !
truth is , she has an affair too
know the tenor she plays accompaniment for?
he's her lover !
do you know?
i saw it all when i was following her around
am i wrong?
speak up for yourself
oh , i forgot you're gagged
but you can nod , can't you?
do what you should do !
ah ...
you already knew !
didn't you?
didn't you?
how about this
i'm kind of depressed
so if you really want to buy some time ... ... you can try to make me laugh
every time you succeed , i'll extend the deadline for another 5 minutes
you've made good comedies
now , you can try your hand on acting in one
okay
ready and ...
you son of a bitch !
you ... you've never seen me losing my temper , right?
i'm going to show it to you now
you son of a bitch
your dad was a moron and he made you a loser
is that my fault?
did i rob your blank? !
did i steal your wife?
what do i have to do with your unhappy existence?
shame on you , moron
why don't you just kill yourself?
your life is a waste of time anyway
want me to make you laugh?
do you know who you're talking to?
i'm ryu ji ho , " the " ryu ji ho !
you're merely a lowlife extra !
want me to make you ... what?
get the hell out of here
just untie me and go home !
go fix your son some instant noodles , okay? !
you've freaked me out and corrupted me !
your mission has been completed !
i'll never mention what happened today
if you want her fingers this much ... ... cut them all off !
or better , just cut off her hands !
why bother cutting off her fingers one by one?
just finish it quickly and get the hell out of here
i want nothing more
no , wait !
my closing statement
you've never gone for cheap laugh like this in your comedies
you're so disappointing !
wait , wait !
i was too wound up and ...
i made mistakes
i swear i didn't mean to do so ...
wait !
wait !
what are you doing now?
what are you doing?
wait , wait , wait
give me one more chance
just give me one more try !
please !
i beg you !
my pose was bad , and i couldn't help making that kind of mistakes
don't be so inflexible !
just once more chance ...
damn it
i shouldn't have given you any false hope ...
nowadays , if you get to the hospital within 10 hours ... ... they can reattach the fingers neatly
no !
wait !
i'll do it !
i'll kill her !
look , i'm doing it now !
you bastard !
i said i was going to do it !
why didn't you wait? !
you saw it too !
you know i have no choice
honey , i'm going to do it , okay?
that was three ...
three , so , seven ...
you'll keep your seven , honey !
i'm not doing this because i hate you , okay?
you think i'm doing this because i hate your wife?
hate " is nobody's fault
for example , who do you think she hates more right now?
me or you?
let's hear it !
kill her !
kill her !
what are you waiting for , idiot?
kill her !
kill her !
you see?
easy , ma'am
you probably will get one finger left on each hand
he's got to give in by that time
you can still become a percussionist
no law against playing drums with " chopsticks
common folks like me prefer drum beats to music
no !
no !
you're right , better to just cut off her whole hand
damn time flies ...
47 seconds ... 46 seconds ...
no !
45 seconds ... 44 seconds , 43 seconds 42 seconds , 41 seconds 40 seconds , 39 seconds 38 seconds , 37 seconds
36 seconds , 35 seconds ... 34 seconds , 33 seconds 32 seconds , 31 seconds 30 seconds , 29 seconds 25 seconds ... 22 seconds ... 20 seconds , 19 seconds 18 seconds , 17 seconds 16 seconds , 15 seconds ... 14 seconds , 13 seconds 12 seconds , 11 seconds 10 seconds 9 seconds 8 seconds
no !
7 seconds !
6 seconds !
5 seconds !
4 seconds !
3 seconds !
mr. director ...
how about this?
for example ...
you scumbags ...
i'll take revenge !
i'm sorry
i'm sorry ; it can't be helped
i tried my best !
you saw it all !
yes , you did !
i have to do this for my wife , you know
i really love her
it's hard for a kid like you to understand
the world is filled with things you can't get away from
no matter how hard you struggle ... ... there are things you're being forced to do
dear ...
alright , honey !
just wait a bit !
i'll take care of it !
i'm sorry ... really sorry ...
i'm sorry ... ple ... please !
don't rush me !
i'm trying !
it'll be over soon !
i'm sorry i shouted , honey ; you know i love you !
i don't believe you have another man !
i don't care even if it's true !
i'm going to forget it all
after all , i'm the head of the house
i must forget everything happened today
i'll just think of it as a dream
i love you , honey !
i'm so sorry , kid !
i'm truly sorry
please forgive me
i love you , mi ran !
please forgive me , this grown up ... this old man ...
forgive me , you have to forgive me !
honey , i love you !
forgive me ...
i'm sorry , sorry !
forgive me ...
