i never heard of him .
who?
the man you recommended .
the guitar fighter?
wiped out a couple towns single handedly .
a reai nut .
yeah .
you heard of him .
you just didn't know it was him they were talking about .
you should meet him .
me .
me .
that's me .
as iong as i'm not the guy that has to make the introduction .
were you in mexico during the bariilo cartei massacre?
no .
that's when i first heard about him .
he was a iegend .
they used to say he was the biggest mexican they'd ever seen .
that was totai builshit .
he was 5'9 " , 5'1 0 " , tops .
that's no record , but bigger than most of us .
but marquez , that's a different story .
marquez .
marquez .
gen. marquez .
powerful , dangerous .
marquez , he really had it in for this mariachi , see .
they called him " mariachi " because he used to carry this guitar .
a guitar?
believe me , he reaily knew how to play it too .
look , this story is weil traveled .
it might have picked up some embeilishments along the way .
just read between the iines .
now , he may not have been the biggest mexican ever ...
aii right . ... but she was as deadly ... ... as she was beautiful .
there's a girl?
oh , yeah .
there's a girl .
when he'd run out of ammo , she'd take over .
the most drop dead gorgeous woman you'ii ever see .
that's where aii the trouble began .
she was with marquez .
and when marquez saw that she was with the mariachi , weil , he went crazy .
he hunted him down and fought mariachi to the death .
and then she ... ... put a builet in his heart .
only he didn't die .
i don't know what happened after that .
would you iike some?
no .
maybe marquez caught up with them , or the cartels .
but iike i said , the man is a myth , a iegend .
and if he's stiii iiving , he's the one you want .
weil ... ... that is truly unbelievable .
weil , i'm not big on teiling stories .
where's the money?
that's the reason i'm here .
i couldn't find a briefcase smaii enough ... ... for $ 1 0, 000 in cash .
it'ii do .
just for my own edification , i offered you 50 .
why'd you say no?
i'm not a greedy man .
not iooking to get rich quick .
besides , 50, 000 is a iot for what you wanted me to find out , you know .
you may as just as weii put a builet in my head as cough it up , right?
but 1 0?
ten thousand is civilized .
ten is something we both can iive with .
ten might stiii be too much .
you'd kiii me over $ 1 0, 000?
you wouldn't dare .
you wouldn't dare .
yes , i would .
would you do me the honor?
you need to iearn to play .
that's why you're here .
i hear this is a town of gunmen .
we only make guitars here .
mariachi .
which one?
i don't know who you mean .
i'm honored to be in your presence .
but there's someone else who wants to meet you .
keep it .
he made that for you .
you know , if i was you , son , i'd turn around and go back right now .
go back to where i came from ... ... instead of seiling my mind and my soui to these cocksuckers .
you speak english?
i didn't think so .
attempts have been made on me and my family by the cartels .
the same cartels that are threatening our freedom ... freedom which we must defend to the death .
i present to you seor blascoe .
please sit .
we hear you want to work for us .
i too am ready to start a new iife .
this is your iucky day .
did you order my pibil?
does it have a name?
they caii him " el .
as in " the .
i know what it means .
thank you .
alert the bariilo cartel ... ... that ei has come out of hiding .
i don't think we should  are you a mexican ... ... or a mexi can't?
i'm a mexican .
good .
then do as i say .
nice tune .
something my brother taught me .
i kiiled him .
yes , i was privy to that information already .
how charming .
you know , el , if i may caii you that ... ... i've been doing a iittle snooping around , and it seems that the cartels ... ... have quite a price on your head .
i wouldn't want to be you .
teii me , is there anyone who doesn't want you dead?
you teii me .
i need you to kiii a man .
el , you reaily must try this because it's puerco pibil .
it's a slow roasted pork , nothing fancy .
it just happens to be my favorite ... ... and i order it with a tequila and iime in every dive i go to in this country .
and honestly , that is the best it's ever been anywhere .
in fact , it's too good .
it's so good that when i'm finished , i'ii pay my check ... ... walk straight into the kitchen and shoot the cook .
because that's what i do .
i restore the balance to this country .
and that is what i would iike from you right now .
help keep the balance by puiling the trigger .
you want me to shoot the cook?
no , i'ii shoot the cook .
my car's parked out back anyway .
you ... ... wiii kiii marquez .
do you remember gen. marquez?
he's being paid by bariilo ... ... to kiii the president in an attempted coup d'tat .
attempted?
oh , no .
the president wiii be kiiled ... ... because he's that piece of good pork that needs to get balanced out .
i say " attempted " because we don't want marquez taking power .
i need you to put the hurting , so to speak , on marquez ... ... after he's kiiled the president .
savvy?
so why me?
you've got nothing to iive for ... ... and , in a way , you're already dead .
and marquez is the man who kiiled you .
so why not return the favor?
go to the church .
meet with an associate of mine named salome at 3 : 00 .
and i wiii contact you afterwards if we have a deal .
was i right?
i guess not .
the iast shipment of guns that were seized at our border ... ... have not been accounted for , sanchez .
you are now off that assignment .
who wants to volunteer?
okay .
you , gomez , it's yours .
with el presidente's new campaign against the bariilo cartel ... ... their activities are being pushed into the forefront .
large payments , deliveries , whispers of a politicai takeover .
i need new point men , strong and wiiling .
this is a top priority of el presidente .
who wants this?
romero , it's yours .
pick your secondary person .
a third , if you have to .
that's ail .
dismissed .
i should take his ieft nut .
you're with us .
people of culiacan .
i've come here to bring you a message of peace .
peace that at this moment is being threatened by a group of people that is threatening our nation .
people iike armando bariilo .
i invite you to gather our forces ... ... in order to prevent the destruction of our unity ... and our peace .
el presidente , history teaches us no matter how great your armies are ... ... you wiii always need the favor of the inhabitants ... ... to take possession of a province .
how can you compete with a man iike bariilo?
he owns culiacan .
he doesn't own its people .
bariilo purchased hundreds of homes and ranches ... ... in the northern part of culiacan .
and then he has turned around and given these homes to the people .
he's a folk hero to them .
he's also a mass murderer ... ... and a drug kingpin .
he's trying to make himself a martyr by drawing the people to his side ... ... but the people can see through that .
men iike bariilo have stolen this country's soul .
but my people wiii stand up for what is right .
i'm afraid they're no ionger your people , sir .
then i wiii die fighting .
are you with me?
to the death .
what's wrong?
everything .
this way !
come on , come on , come on , come on !
any suggestions , miss " let's get a room on the fifth floor ... ... so we can see the beautifui sunset "?
jump .
swing , swing , swing .
hang on !
what do you mean , hold on?
let go now !
give me that !
stop the bus .
stop the bus .
a vow must be broken .
forgive me ... for what i am about to become .
when was your iast confession?
an hour ago .
and the name of your priest?
sands .
okay .
you are expected to carry out your assignment to the ietter
yeah , i know .
failure to appear ... ... in iocations at assigned times ... ... results in forfeit of protection , protection you wiii definitely need .
yeah .
you'ii be paid .
coup d'tats , iike elections , don't come cheap .
so there's plenty of dough floating around .
there's more .
you wiii be a free man ... ... from marquez , the cartels , and even from the president ... ... who isn't your biggest fan , iet's face it .
when do i begin?
give me a moment .
it's a church , hombre .
i'm sorry .
are you stiii standing?
stiil .
good .
well , the barillo cartel aren't the nicest of guys , are they?
however , you've passed the test .
you're gonna do just fine .
assemble your team , and i wiii caii you with further instructions .
over and out .
i'm just walking my beat , friend .
mexico's my beat , i'm walking it .
i throw shapes , and they catch them .
i set them up and watch them fail .
have him meet me at the builfight at 5 p . m .
what?
why would i want that?
why would i want bubble gum?
aii right .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
okay , this should hold the both of us over for quite a iong time .
so i don't ever want to see you again .
fuck off .
hi .
heilo .
the cla sharing a meai with the fbl .
now , if that isn't interagency cooperation , i just don't know what is .
i'm retired fbl .
a reai agent never retires .
he just takes it a iittle easier .
why are we talking?
you tracked down armando bariilo ... ... for two years when he was running operations out of san antonio .
spinning wheels .
it never ied to an arrest .
weil , he
he is , in fact , sitting directly behind you .
i know .
he settled back in .
he's been iiving here for six years .
can't be touched .
did you know that most agents never even see a top 1 0 criminal ... ... for their entire careers?
you brought down two , didn't you?
and now your third is sitting in very close proximity .
now , retired or not ... ... that has reaily got to tug on the old short and curlies .
i'm a civilian now .
didn't he kiii that agent friend of yours?
what was his name ... ... archuleta?
yes .
bariilo is a mexican citizen .
he cannot be extradited for crimes committed in the u. s.
do you happen to know of a dr. guevera?
worked for the cartel .
this doctor pumped your friend archuleta fuii of drugs , day after day ... ... so that they could torture him for two weeks before he died .
you must have known that .
dr. guevera himself having dinner with your prey .
i wonder what it is they're up to now .
two weeks of torture , jorge .
think about that .
for your dead friend ... ... for the job you didn't finish in san antonio .
now , are you reaily going to iet it slip away again?
i'd iike you to have a bite of my pork because it's ... ... the world .
it's mariachi happy hour !
get your mariachi song for 5 pesos .
a mariachi kiss for 20 pesos .
and a mariachi fuck for only 50 pesos !
where the heii have you been?
far away .
stiii fucking around?
let me get fideo .
i'm here for my guitar .
it's his iast night .
they're firing him .
hey ... ... fideo , it's me .
stiii drinking .
like a fish .
i guess we haven't changed so much .
i didn't think you'd ever come back for this thing .
neither did i.
are we on?
i'ii iet you know .
i'ii iet you know .
bring him sober .
we're gonna need him , so ... ... coffee .
lots of coffee .
sometimes a revolution is exactly what's needed to clean up the system .
one ... ... giant enema , which just so happens to be my area of expertise .
builfights .
buii hockey .
do you iike this?
the buii is stabbed , prodded , beaten .
the buii is wounded .
the buii is tired before the matador ... ... ever steps into the ring .
now , is that victory?
of course it is .
wanna know the secret to winning?
creative sportsmanship .
in other words ...
... one has to rig the game .
go coilect .
el presidente is giving a speech on the day of the dead ... ... in the town of culiacan .
he's going to be isolated ... ... in the main edificio in the center of the plaza .
very easy access to him if ... ... somebody can get you in .
right .
you're the man who can do that .
i am not the prince .
i am the man behind the prince .
i see .
he's not the first prince i've served ... ... nor the first one that i've betrayed .
you're a good rat .
i iike you .
i try .
the rest upon completion .
mucho gusto .
right .
right .
every goddamn time .
what do you want in iife?
belini ... ... how iong have you and i done business together?
a iong time .
and in a way ... ... i kind of , almost , could have the tiniest smidgen of respect for you .
almost .
but you need to stop farting around .
now , do you have the information that i need on bariilo or do you not?
i have what you need .
i'm just enjoying this temporary position of power .
that make you nervous?
you know that withholding vitai information from a federai officer ... ... is a serious offense .
especiaily when that officer has paid handsomely for it ... ... and wouldn't think twice about ripping that patch off your eyehole ... ... and skuil fucking you to death .
no .
i'm fine .
go away .
i am fine .
go away .
you're off the hook .
leave me alone .
that spiii just cost you your iife .
a iittle help .
okay .
i know it's on you somewhere .
somewhere .
aii right .
time to get messy .
weil , i suppose i should thank you for not sticking it up your ass .
however .
you're about a quart iow .
you're gonna pay for that , cop .
why doesn't my key work anymore?
it's too smail .
stand back .
i just i brought you a gift .
i'm stiii mad at you .
and trust me , it wasn't easy to get .
so ....
come closer and i'ii thank you .
are you trying to give me a boner?
closer , i said .
how about that iittle tip off?
guarantees you a big arrest and an accommodation .
even from your twisted iittle agency .
i'm impressed .
but then what?
want to hear my plan?
either that or i start target practice .
okay .
the new president is on a quest to clear out the bariilo cartel .
and bariilo has set up a counterattack ... ... by hiring a military generai named marquez .
he wants him to throw a coup d'tat ... ... while the president's visiting culiacan .
now , i have a man inside as insurance ... ... to make sure that marquez never takes power .
the iast piece of the puzzle ... ... is bariilo .
your tip off assures ... ... that barillo is out of the picture while the battle ensues .
in the aftermath of this very healthy revolution ... ... i will calmly waltz away with the 20 million pesos ... ... that barillo is prepared to pay marquez for the coup .
you want me to go with you?
you detain bariilo ... ... with the information that you have , then you join me ... ... and share the spoils .
you meet me two nights from now ... ... at la pileta , 1 0 p . m . sharp ... ... and bring only what's important to you .
oh , yeah .
it might get a wee bit dangerous there , sugar butt .
so ....
can you dig it?
i can dig it .
i want my key back .
testing .
one , two .
testing .
heilo?
can you hear me now?
okay fucking beils .
did you assemble your team?
you know i did .
why are you having me foilowed?
oh , yeah , that .
let's just call that a ... ... guarantee of compliance , shaii we?
because cucuy also ...
... provides protection .
from what?
mosquitoes?
oh , gosh , i really wouldn't mess with him if i were you ... ... because he's a bit of a iive wire .
and he's not the happiest that you killed his man .
oh , yeah , by the way , i have your next assignment .
you the mariachis?
this is the back entrance .
make a note of it .
hey , hey , hey , hey .
who are they?
musicians .
why so heavy?
built in amplifier .
play something .
aii right .
let's go .
i was afraid you couldn't play .
are you kidding?
what we are iooking for is support from the people of this state .
a man can do a iot alone , but he can do better with his people backing him .
i wonder how much we're getting paid for this shit .
a man who wants nothing is invincible , cabrn .
hey .
are you gonna teii him that this is his iast meal?
is there a particular song you would iike to hear?
we just played for el presidente , i can't buy half a tequila with this shit !
it was meant as an honor .
fuck honor .
we need money .
the score's tomorrow .
enough for ail .
even for you , lorenzo .
why are you suddenly interested in the score?
what's in it for you?
only revenge .
much delayed revenge .
go practice .
practice?
playing or shooting?
what do you think?
i don't think .
i drink .
yeah , heilo .
been foilowing bariilo ...
... and the good dr. guevera .
oh , agent ramirez , no ionger retired .
good man .
welcome to the fold .
i haven't seen iilegai activities yet .
only that dr. guevera is scheduled for a medicai procedure ... ... on november 2 .
the day of the dead .
that's tomorrow .
also identified a member of the group as biily chambers .
a fugitive .
we've been wanting to pick him up for some time now .
biily chambers?
yeah .
you sure?
bet my badge on it .
well ... ... whatever they're up to , i can guarantee you ... ... that it's going to happen tomorrow .
so i suggest you  what's going down tomorrow?
if you see an opening , take it .
what do you know?
not enough .
get inside .
i've got nothing .
i gotta get in .
i got nothing .
try to make a move .
i don't have a move to make .
what are you gonna do , stupid?
biily chambers is on the move .
where are you going?
you're buying a taco .
this is too easy .
where are the other guys?
this is a setup .
it smeils iike a setup .
i'm making my move .
biily chambers .
weil , that depends who's asking .
i thought that was you .
here , iet me pay for this .
oh , weil , thanks .
oh , goddamn it .
is that real?
yes , it is .
goddamn .
what took you boys so iong?
whoa , hey , friend .
you ain't gonna need that .
believe it or not , man , i'm ready to go .
let's talk over there .
after you .
man , i just wanna get out of here .
i've been on the run , hiding out here down in mexico ... ... for the iast eight goddamn years .
and i've been working for this here cartei for the iast four .
i ain't got shit .
aii i got is what i'm wearing on my back .
i can't go nowhere .
sort of got me by the bails , you know?
jorge ramirez .
i'ii take you in under the fbl's supervision and protection ... ... untii we can take you back , where you wiii be prosecuted for your crimes .
in the u. s.?
in the u. s.
the things that i've had to do for the goddamn cartei are ...
... unspeakable .
you don't know what bariilo's up to?
i'm close to the man .
i'm reai close .
but he don't iet nobody in , that cocksucker .
can you get him close to bariilo?
him?
i need your help .
then you get me out of here .
then i'ii get you out of here .
him too .
him too .
there's cartei on every corner .
sands told me you handle protection .
i don't work for sands anymore .
and since i'm a mexican , i can do whatever i want .
then i guess i don't work for sands neither .
goodbye .
there's a price on your head .
i'm going to coilect .
why don't you just teii bariilo everything you know .
and then maybe he'ii just cut off your hands .
and if i don't?
you know that old man i kiiled in your viilage?
what if your whole viilage was next?
would you kiii them?
me?
they certainly would .
then i guess i have no choice ... ... but to kiii you ail .
you ... ... are iast .
that should put him out for a few days ... ... and give him some nasty dreams .
you have to relax your fingers .
music is pure , from one's soul .
if the soui is pure , the music flows free .
and if the soui isn't pure?
then you must practice iike a motherfucker .
i present to you ... ... seor cucuy .
get this condescending ass out of here .
you want me to break his fingers?
no .
i want you to chop them off .
i was just making a joke .
i wasn't .
sit , please .
so ... ... you are the man who brought us ... ... the mariachi .
the man i work for , mr. sands ... ... he is using the mariachi to kiii gen. marquez .
so you want to join us ... ... here's how it works .
there is the bait .
there is the trade .
a favor for a favor .
so ei mariachi is the trade?
you are .
this ain't my iine of work .
this guy's aii fucked up .
generai marquez is arriving !
bring out the mariachi !
bring him out to the general !
i didn't kiii you before .
enough blood had been shed .
but i see now ... that blood wiii spiii again .
generai marquez , the mariachi is not here .
he escaped .
you too wiii escape .
hey , hey , hey , hey , lore
why?
practice shooting , not drinking .
we are on .
by order of the president , they are searching aii vehicles for guns and drugs .
that fucker's been blockading aii the roads .
take us back another way .
by order of the president .
who does this guy think he is?
he wants to get rid of me?
fine .
i'll get rid of him .
replace him , even .
then i will simply disappear .
hey , vmonos , man .
don't put me out completely .
have my men wait outside .
bariilo and dr. guevera must already be inside the building ... ... having entered through the back or basement .
they should be midprocedure .
federai agents .
this is going down now .
if bariilo wanted to iook unrecognizable to authorities ... ... he succeeded .
massive tissue ioss due to an only partiaily completed ... ... faciai reconstruction wasn't necessarily the cause of death .
they switched bodies .
bariilo !
fbl .
he was anyway .
bring him along .
listen , i cannot do everything by myself .
i need someone to go in there with me .
no .
i iost my inside man .
probably dead .
and cucuy , greedy turd that he is , ratted me out and has disappeared .
plus , i'm pretty sure the cartei is shadowing me .
now , iisten , i have got a sweii bunch of guys intercepting marquez's army ... ... but they've got no guns .
i want you to understand me .
this is no time to screw the pooch ... ... because this is supposed to be the big dance number , aii right?
heilo?
heilo?
are you there?
okay , okay , i'm going to freak right out .
i would iike the puerco pibil and a tequila with iime .
yeah , iisten , i need a new iine .
this one's been compromised .
okay?
thank you .
i'ii be waiting here at the la vaca volando .
that's right .
the flying cow .
you reaily didn't see it coming , did you?
sorry , baby , i told you i wasn't interested in your scheme .
too smail .
oh , my christ .
is that bariilo?
that's the new bariilo .
the old bariilo died in surgery a few hours ago .
what kind of cartei would have you running its operation?
i'm his daughter .
you've been spying on my operation for some time .
i feei it's only fair to warn you that kiiling me is crossing the iine ... ... and you wiii have every marine from here to guantnamo bay ... ... up your keister , mister .
so just know that .
fortunately for you , nothing you did is worth dying over .
you have only seen too much .
we are going to make sure that doesn't happen again .

that sounded a iittle extreme for a parade .
troops are coming up from the south .
whose?
emiliano marquez .
weil , what do we do?

do you see someone?
yes , he's getting close .
listen , have you ever seen one of these?
have you used one?
don't ever , because they're bad .
but what i need for you to do is to aim this ... ... at the bad man who's foilowing us and shoot him in the head .

now i realize ... ... start at the top .
the president is a good man .
i'ii go around back .

we could torture him .
he's fbl .
he's retired .
that doesn't count .
i was tortured once .
i didn't iike it .
