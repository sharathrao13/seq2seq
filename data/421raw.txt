let's go .
come on .
oh , shit .
perimeter alarms are off .
killing video surveillance .
everyone's in .
hallway alarms deactivated .
working on main gallery .
this way .
are you ready , hector?
disarming security lasers .
there it is .
no , wait .
god damn it .
there's a booby trap .
wait .
jose , don't .
wait , no .
fuck .
shit .
go .
come on !
go .
hello?
victor .
sandra .
i'm in barcelona .
my el greco was stolen last night .
what?
i need you on a plane .
right now .
i'll be on the next flight over .
can't believe i listened to you .
victor , i'm so sorry .
you should be .
what are you doing in my bed?
bad dream .
careful , allie .
it's heavy .
i'll get it .
daddy .
hey , my alley cat .
you're getting too big for your old man .
hey .
hi , thanks for doing this .
okay .
so , maria's going to pick her up from school everyday ... and stay with her until you get home from work .
and there's a week's worth of microwave dinners in the freezer ... and all of her favorite snacks are in the fridge .
can we watch scary movies?
no dice .
absolutely not .
al , will you do mommy a favor and go up and get my jacket for me , please?
what?
i'm not gone a month here and you changed the locks .
berate me when i get back .
so , you're off to your old stomping grounds .
it's not what you think .
i have to go smooth victor boyd's feathers .
this whole thing is my fault .
i'm the one who convinced him to hang that painting in barcelona .
if it weren't for me , it'd be still hanging in his bathroom in the hamptons .
victor boyd .
you know i hate that rich asshole .
50 cents .
for what?
mommy says whenever you swear , you got to give me 50 cents .
50 cents .
is that right?
what the hell is this?
now it's $1 .
you're killing me , kid .
how is this?
victor boyd , that rich ... jerk .
dork is fine , too .
dork?
give me a kiss .
one more .
i got you .
so , he gets this outrageously expensive trophy ripped off ... and you got to go globetrotting to the other side of the earth?
shame just for a painting .
it's not just a painting .
it's an el greco .
some people dedicate their entire lives to studying them .
dedicate .
waste .
let's not split hairs here .
cab's here .
i am gonna miss you so much .
i love you , mommy .
love you too , honey .
i'll call you in a day or two .
it's the third painting stolen in spain in a month .
and all the robberies have been clean .
no clues , no leads , no suspects .
i'm sorry , victor .
i just thought exhibiting your el greco here would increase the market value .
let me tell you about value .
these paintings are my children .
this collection is my life .
i hired you because i thought you felt the same way about art .
this exposition will be over in two weeks .
that's how long you have ... to find my christ , or i'll find another agent .
inspector , i'd like you to meet sandra walker .
she's my agent from new york .
inspector rubio will be in charge of the case .
how do you do?
mr. boyd claims you are an expert on the world market .
that you know all international buyers .
i know most of them .
any suspects yet?
we're checking on raymond douglas .
i know raymond douglas .
he collects illuminated medieval art .
he's not your guy .
i told you she was good .
good luck .
thank you .
don't let me down .
shall we go in?
yes .
one doesn't exactly sell an el greco in the street , you know .
our investigation is concentrating on potential buyers .
you know their tastes , mrs. walker .
make a list .
you'll be working with our art expert .
a professor from the barcelona institute of fine arts , named ...
daniel?
yeah?
sandra .
i can't believe it .
daniel and i studied here at the institute together .
well , then you'll have no problem working together .
let me know if you need anything .
thank you .
they told me the new york expert's name was walker ...
my husband's name .
well , congratulations .
it's good to see you .
how did you get involved in this?
the police needed a consultant .
i happen to know all the private owners in the city .
most of them have let me study their collections for the institute .
well , where do we start?
it was close , but ...
no , sir .
it won't happen again .
we'll be more careful next time .
i promise .
okay , to us , cheers .
to all the money .
yeah .
you fucked up , jose .
i just got a little nervous .
i thought all the alarms were off .
come on .
it was a mistake .
shit .
do you know the kind of people we are working for?
do you know how they punish failure?
repeat after me .
okay .
no more ...
no more ... ... mistakes . ... mistakes .
i promise .
drink .
hiroshi yakamura .
billionaire .
founder of kodo industries .
he collects 16th and 17th century european art ... and has a particular affection for el greco .
maria teresa alcalde .
one of the wealthiest ... and most ruthless businesswomen in europe .
interpol accused her of illegally obtaining a rembrandt in 1989 .
she claimed it was a misunderstanding ... and returned the painting to the dutch government .
and , finally , in my opinion , our main suspect .
dimitri maximov , head of the baltic drug cartel .
maximov cultivates an image of a european intellectual .
he likes french wine , cuban cigars , russian poetry .
at the end of the cold war , maximov looted many of the museums ... that were previously under soviet control .
men like maximov see art as a trophy , not as a living thing .
good .
well , these are the 12 buyers identified ... by mr. marin and mrs. walker as potential suspects .
i want to know everything about them .
is that all?
wellington's barcelona is having our annual auction next week ... and all of our suspects are confirmed bidders .
and daniel and i will be attending that .
excellent .
okay .
thank you both .
lights .
back to work .
we have many new leads to pursue .
we make a pretty good team .
we always did .
hello .
hey , i've been trying to reach you .
i was just about to call you .
how is everything going?
great .
we are making breakfast .
she's not giving you any trouble , is she?
no way .
not my little angel .
hey , big al ... put some cornflakes on it , it's yummy .
listen , the bank called .
something about a deposit cleared .
it must have been a pretty big sum of money for them to call you personally .
what deposit?
i haven't received any checks lately .
i wouldn't know , seeing that we don't have that joint bank account any more .
it's probably a computer glitch .
i'll take care of it in the morning .
sure you don't want me to take care of it?
bruce , it's my problem .
i'll fix it .
okay , just asking .
all right , i'll talk to you later , okay?
bye .
how are things in paradise?
my husband , the alpha male , trying to control things .
say , partner , all this detective work has made me hungry .
i don't know .
there's a lot of work to do .
come on .
a nice dinner .
some good vino .
we'll talk about old times .
just talk .
okay .
i can't believe you brought me here .
i hoped it would bring back fond memories .
it does .
it's hard to believe it's been 10 years .
yeah .
i keep expecting to run into claudio or miranda .
did i mention tonia became a hairdresser?
no .
we had a lot of fun , daniel .
we're all scattered all over the world .
none of us paint anymore .
you were so good .
why did you stop?
now that you mention it , i think you're right .
i was .
no .
but not great .
but no regrets .
i love teaching .
besides , you were the one with real talent .
no .
what happened?
family .
career .
are you happy at least?
i was , at first .
very .
but lately , bruce and i have been having problems .
it's tough for a new york police officer .
he sees reality on the street every day ... and how can he understand something as ethereal as art?
and how do i explain to him that it's not just a hobby?
it's something you do with all of your heart ... or not at all .
we've been separated for about a month now .
well , i'm very sorry .
look , sandra .
i want you to know that if any of this makes you uncomfortable ...
any of what?
working with me .
you don't make me uncomfortable , daniel .
it's good to have a friend .
okay , enough about me .
what about you?
any special lady in your life?
there was .
once .
and?
what happened?
she was offered a job in new york and chose her career over me .
imitating the great masters is a first step in developing your craft .
salvador dali learned to replicate all classic art ... before he formed his own unique style .
hi .
hey , class , we have a visitor .
this is sandra walker .
you'd better be nice to her .
she could have a significant impact on your careers .
there's a lot of talent in this class .
but then again , they have a very gifted teacher .
no .
a teacher is only as good as his students .
the auction is in an hour .
yeah .
let me get my jacket .
toni , please take over .
okay .
see you .
bye .
sir lawrence stanton .
andre buchart .
oliver roughchild , gonzalo ...
sheikh al ahmad , senora alcalde .
that proxy bidder is on the phone with yakamura .
a rogue's gallery of suspects .
but no maximov .
maybe he's not our guy .
oh , no .
you've got to be kidding me .
victor .
sandra .
why didn't you tell me you were coming today?
i could have put together a portfolio for you .
actually , miss yee of sotheby's is assisting me today .
okay .
any news on my christ?
we're doing the best we can , victor .
one week down .
one week to go .
i guess i'd better start looking for a new career .
maximov .
quite a collection .
have a favorite?
this one .
early luis tristan .
somebody has already bought it .
some men are attracted to that which they cannot possess .
mrs ...
sandra walker .
wellington's .
dimitri maximov .
baltic industries .
pleasure .
wellington's .
it so happens i'm looking for fresh talent .
my last agent displeased me .
i fired her .
whom do you represent?
victor boyd .
although , as you can see at the moment , that's an open question .
my , my .
it appears we are both available .
we should meet sometime .
i can show you our new acquisitions .
ready?
okay .
let's do it .
thursday , noon .
i'd love to hear what you have to offer .
how did it go?
he's staying on a yacht in the main harbor .
we're meeting thursday at noon .
jesus .
sandra , you work fast .
ladies and gentlemen , please take your seats .
let's go .
the bidding is about to begin .
i'm so sorry , madam .

let me help .
daniel , you'll make it worse .

silence , gentlemen .
what the hell?
sit down , please .
sit down .
silence .

hold on .
silence .
we have to do something .
i'll call the police .

sandra , wait .
there they are .
yeah , it's a white van .
heading down via laietana .
i can't quite read the license plate .
it's ...
i'll get closer .
hang on .
we've got company .
all right .
lose them .
oh , shit .
oh , my god .
no .
please , my car .
hey , sandra , are you ...
sandra?
oh , my god .
sorry about your car .
it's only an object .
a very expensive one but still an object .
i'm sorry about your head .
it's no great loss .
i hardly ever use it .
the doctor said he will release you today on one condition .
no more driving .
thank you for being here .
mommy .
what a surprise .
it's so good to see you .
we flew on an airplane .
and you brought flowers .
that was daddy's idea .
i wanted to bring candy .
what are you guys doing here?
we came to take you home .
i can't leave now .
daniel needs my help .
sandra has been a vital part of our investigation .
i'm sure the police department would hate to lose her .
right .
bruce walker .
daniel marin .
alison walker .
how do you do?
charmed .
have you ever tasted crema catalana , alison?
no?
come with me , you will love it .
we'll go to the cafeteria while mommy and daddy talk , okay?
so you're working with your ex boyfriend?
daniel and i are just friends .
i can't leave because i'm right in the middle of this case .
and on thursday , we are gonna meet with the prime suspect .
who's that?
dimitri maximov .
the russian mobster?
yes .
babe , are you kidding me?
this guy has killed more people than the plague .
no way .
wrap it up .
you told me you were coming here to baby sit this victor boyd .
let's go .
home .
no .
for the first time in a long time , i feel like i'm doing something important .
it's my decision .
i'm staying .
any evidence that the stolen paintings are on board ... will help us to get a warrant .
what's wrong with you?
this guy is an animal .
maximov lives in total fear of rival gangs .
what choice do we have?
let me tell you something .
once we had a guy that worked on the inside as a courier for maximov .
he sampled the merchandise one time too many .
by the time we caught up with him ... he was sitting in a chair with his balls marinated in a bottle of vodka .
you're not going in there .
i'm going .
you're not going in there .
enough .
you're out of your jurisdiction here .
please .
you okay?
yes , i'm fine .
are you sure you wanna do it?
yes .
yeah .
i know .
okay .
here we go .
mrs. walker .
ravishing .
as usual .
forgive me .
an influential man makes persistent enemies .
she's okay .
my wife says you're a professor .
are you an artist , too?
those who can't do , teach "?
i hope your appreciation of fine things ... extends beyond art .
this sherry comes from the region of seville .
exquisite bouquet .
i see you like my samson and delilah .
i do .
i like rembrandt's version much better .
i like that .
many try to flatter me .
i value honesty .
deceit , on the other hand ...
take delilah ... she thinks she's clever , betraying samson .
stealing the source of his power .
but samson had the last laugh .
delilah ended up in the temple ruins , crushed ... a pulp of flesh and blood .
fitting end for a traitor , don't you think?
i do .
i also think that this is a very good copy , dimitri .
was it taken from the national gallery?
actually , the national gallery has a copy .
this is the original .
really?
that's a start .
do you think i'm bragging?
no .
i'm not like other men , sandra .
when i desire something beautiful , i take it .
well , let's get back to business .
shall we?
what are you offering?
security .
more .
insurance .
more .
exclusive service .
i can have your services exclusively?
lf you like .
very much .
no rest for the wicked .
no .
there isn't .
excuse me .
okay .
i'm in way over my head here .
i'm gonna find the d. h. and get out .
d. h.?
what's that?
antique art is sensitive to temperature conditions .
maximov didn't go through all the trouble to steal the el grecos to let them rot .
he'll keep a dehumidifying chamber handy .
i think i found it .
it's empty .
no more games .
i'm sorry?
i know why you are here .
you can't keep any secrets from me .
jesus christ .
he is on to her .
i can see right through you .
you are a spy .
we got to go in there now .
you hear me?
wait .
i'm going in .
quiet .
idiot .
my apologies .
i never get so emotional , but it's beluga .
a taste?
sure .
thank you .
why did you call me a spy?
i know who sent you .
victor boyd .
hand on my heart , victor did not send me .
lying insults us both .
victor ... wants to know what paintings i'll be bidding on next ... so he can steal them from me .
can you blame him?
he did have his el greco stolen recently .
he should be careful .
any one of his employees with knowledge ... of his collection and his security systems might just be willing ... to sell that information if the price were right .
yuri .
show this traitor out .
i'm just not sure it's him .
you're the one who said maximov's an animal .
he is .
i'm just not sure he's responsible for this .
look , mommy .
you wanna talk?
about?
us .
what's there to talk about?
you said you wanted your space , i said i wanted mine .
i just thought it might not be a bad idea if we tried .
hello .
daniel .
hola .
i've been trying to call you .
any news?
no , it's okay .
you didn't interrupt anything .
is she talking to her old boyfriend again?
what?
where did you hear that?
women's intuition , daddy .
jesus christ .
50 cents .
you know , now that you wiped me out ...
you might at least buy me an ice cream .
okay .
come with me .
let's go , you little thief .
hey , i'm selling this kid .
big al .
your favorite .
vanilla bean .
yum yum .
when are you coming home?
i'm working on that , babe .
hopefully soon .
why did you leave?
sometimes when people are married , they go through phases ...
like when you get happy and sad .
right now mommy and daddy are going through a little bit of a sad phase .
but that doesn't mean that i love her any less , or you , too .
trust me , i'm doing my best to make things right .
okay?
good .
i'm tired of being the man of the house .
is that right?
if i slit your throat right now , sandra walker ... it will take you 90 seconds to die .
a minute and a half of knowing that your life is about to end .
and there's nothing you can do but watch .
stop helping the cops .
stop harassing people .
go home .
this is your only warning .
are you all right?
i'm okay .
yes .
mommy .
go .
what's going on?
god damn it .
that was too close .
this guy is crazy .
fuck him .
let's go .
get up .
let's go .
you two okay?
yes , we're okay .
what's the word on the plates?
we ran them .
the owner reported it stolen from a disco in sitges three days ago .
maximov must have had those men follow her from the yacht .
you've got to bring him in , inspector .
we've filed for a search warrant .
to arrest him now without evidence would devastate our case .
i'm sorry .
you're sorry?
you're sorry .
this is over .
you understand?
you wanna put yourself in danger , that's fine ...
i'm not gonna let you put our daughter at risk .
come on .
she was safe in new jersey .
if anyone has put her in danger , it's you .
sandra is right .
now that maximov's men have seen her , alison could be in jeopardy .
perhaps you should go home .
perhaps you should stick to the paintbrushes .
where are you going?
we'll be at the hotel .
mr. and mrs. vidal , nice to see you .
thank you for coming .
this is my wife ana .
hello , ana .
and my daughter , gabriela .
hello .
very beautiful .
good to see you , mr. and mrs. puig .
you've met my wife ana?
yes .
how are you?
it's been such a ...
hello .
dr. and mrs. phillips .
so nice to see you .
i'm very glad you were able to make it .
this is my wife ana and my daughter ...
you sure?
alarms are off?
boss says so .
they wouldn't want a guest to accidentally trigger them .
haven't heard from you in a while , jordi .
i thought you'd forgotten me .
no man could ever forget you .
we're wired .
he's in .
remember , i can only interrupt the beams for a few seconds .
three , two , one .
now .
i'm so sorry .
i was adamant this painting stay in catalonia .
call it a matter of personal honor .
what the ...
hector?
shit .
we've been made .
where the fuck are you , hector?
fuck .
there he is .
son of a bitch .
go .
unbelievable .
it was daring .
i'll give them that .
ripping off one of the richest men in spain in the middle of a party .
probably guessed the alarm system would be down .
was the daughter any help?
yeah , sure .
she gave us a detailed description of the waiter .
jordi pons .
you know , there's thousands of them .
senor duran bought the painting at an auction in 2001 ... after a heated bidding war with an anonymous buyer .
i just got off the phone with wellington's .
guess who the anonymous buyer was?
maximov?
when i desire something beautiful , i take it .
his own words .
great job , sandra .
so , you have maximov on tape bragging he has a stolen painting ... in his boat .
now this .
probable cause?
we'll get our search warrant today .
put together a dossier ... with all the valuable stolen art in the last five years ... and help my men identify the paintings .
we might not find the el grecos .
but if we uncover so much as a stolen postage stamp ...
maximov is finished .
come on , partner .
okay .
here's another one .
he is risen by andrei rublev .
stolen from the ukrainian people's museum in '99 .
maximov's cartel was spreading into the ukraine that year .
what a shame , all these paintings .
food's here .
hungry?
i'll wash up .
what's this?
nothing .
the food will get cold .
daniel , i know your style .
you are painting again?
no , don't look .
it's not ready , okay?
no , it's ...
okay .
it's great .
you really think so?
i could sell this .
there's a patron .
he likes my work .
we are talking about an exhibition overseas .
it only takes one sale to start a career .
it's fantastic .
why haven't you mentioned this before?
superstition .
afraid to jinx it .
someone with your talent has nothing to be afraid of .
no , you were the good one .
remember?
no .
what would you do to it?
no .
please .
why not?
yeah .
why not?
no .
come on , please .
look , here .
i insist .
come on , don't think , just let yourself go .
okay .
that's it .
come on .
where are we going?
some fresh air .
you know hector?
hector?
yes .
he owes me money .
you know him?
yeah .
i got to catch him right now .
let's catch him .
come on .
i wish ...
i wish you never left .
come on .
i got to go .
thanks for the ride .
you go?
yes , i have to go .
you sure?
thanks for the ride .
in case you change your mind , here's my card .
sandra .
oh , my god .
are you okay?
go .
but ...
go .
yuri .
ilya .
what the devil?
sandra .
maximov is dead .
his boat was burnt .
what happened?
as your husband pointed out , maximov had many enemies .
it looks like they finally caught up .
no one could have imagined it would end this way .
who says it's over?
the paintings and the culprit have been destroyed .
case closed .
and the kid that got blown up last night .
what's that?
spontaneous combustion?
mrs. walker .
have you ever seen this document?
it's a fax from my office .
yeah .
dated four days before mr. boyd's el greco was stolen .
describing its exact location in the museum and all security precautions .
addressed to dimitri maximov .
where did you get it?
from a letter left for me with the duty officer .
it also contains a bank statement ... indicating a recent deposit was made in your account ... for the amount of $200, 000 . $200, 000?
that's a mistake .
5 % of the painting's worth .
yeah .
it could be a mistake .
or a finder's fee .
wait a second .
i'd like to ask you a few questions .
i don't think so .
get your stuff now .
we're going straight to the american consulate .
i have nothing to hide .
i want to stay and clear this up .
what , you can't tell when you're being set up?
set up?
what do you base that on?
why don't you check the explosives from maximov's boat ... with the kid who got killed last night .
i bet they match .
why would maximov's enemies want to kill some boy?
that's my point exactly , ace .
mr. walker , please .
there won't be any questions without a lawyer present .
you understand?
none .
bruce , please don't make a scene .
i'm going to clear this up .
okay?
i'm gonna handle this .
after you .
so , we're gonna get paid soon?
very soon .
good .
i'm putting my share in the bank for my son .
he's two months old now .
last night ...
i noticed some of the explosives were missing ... and now hector is gone ...
like jose .
yet you're still here .
i figure a two way cut is better than four anyway .
maybe you figured a one way cut is better than two .
sorry , cesar , winner takes all .
what are you doing here?
you're the one who said if i ever changed my mind .
who are you?
and don't tell me you're an old friend of hector's .
i should call the police .
i am the police .
i need to know more about this kid , hector .
he was just a customer .
he was into extreme sports , right?
yeah .
what kind?
everything .
rock climbing , paragliding , scuba diving .
do you know any of his friends?
he used to shop with a guy named jose .
jose?
how do i get in touch with him?
listen , honey .
you wanna get implicated in this?
yeah .
i didn't think so .
don't come back .
so , you've known about this deposit for two weeks ... and you never once called your bank to verify?
i've been busy .
had i known about the amount , of course i would have called .
have you recovered my el greco?
tell me you found it , sandra .
victor , i'm sorry .
mr. boyd , please .
come in .
i'm here to see jose bassols .
my son was killed .
jose's dead?
yes .
my youngest , javier , he was born with curvature of the spine .
an operation could cure him ... but the money ...
jose always said he would find it .
that's hector .
hector diaz .
this is my son .
they did many crazy things .
you know the others?
cesar gomez .
this is fernando manes .
i didn't like him .
his eyes never smiled .
you know where i might find them?
the institute .
they are all art students .
victor .
if you're guilty i'll spare no expense at destroying you .
bruce walker , u. s. immigration .
you got a student here who applied for a visa .
i got to check him out .
okay?
don't worry , it's fine .
all the new beefed up security since 9l11 .
his name is cesar gomez .
what?
no address?
that's odd .
you'll have to speak to his counselor .
who's that?
daniel marin .
do me a favor .
check out another one for me , okay?
i thought you said only one .
that was for a visa .
these others are for green cards , okay?
fernando manes .
m a n e s.
hector diaz .
daniel marin .
jose bassols .
b a s s o l s.
son of a bitch .
i'm not saying it's you .
but it fits .
why not?
a frustrated artist ... tired of seeing other people's paintings sell , while her own art languished .
i gave up painting when i got married .
and i've never regretted my decision .
haven't you?
that's it .
i've done everything i can to convince you that i'm innocent .
now i want to speak to my consulate .
certainly .
you're not under arrest , mrs. walker .
good .
not yet .
but if i were you , i wouldn't leave barcelona .
he actually thinks i'm guilty .
you want me to take you back to the hotel?
no , i think i need some time alone , to think .
i'll get a cab .
jesus christ , sandy .
you almost gave me a heart attack .
what the hell are you doing in here?
i left some papers here the other night .
it's okay .
he's working with prof. marin and i.
how did you get in here?
i had a key .
what are you doing?
trying to find evidence your boyfriend set you up .
okay .
first , he's not my boyfriend .
and second , what the hell are you talking about?
the kid that got killed last night , hector?
he was one of daniel's students .
daniel has thousands of students , bruce .
hector and all three of his buddies were also daniel's students ... and they were all trained in extreme sports .
bruce , jealousy has completely warped your mind .
tell me something .
how did the thieves get into the museum the other night?
through the roof .
that's right .
and at duran's mansion , they just flew off of some cliff?
how about the auction?
they climbed down the side of the building .
what does all this prove?
it proves that they had the training and the ability ... to pull something like this off .
daniel is using them , just like he's using you .
that doesn't make any sense , because daniel has been working ... with me day and night to help me solve this .
he's been working to set you up , sandy .
just like he set up maximov .
where are these kids?
i want to speak to them .
good luck .
it ain't gonna be easy , 'cause two of them ... are already dead .
oh , god .
this boy was at the auction .
he's the one who spilled the wine on me .
daniel pretended not to know him .
i happen to know all the private owners in the city .
he knew all the el greco owners .
he'd been in their homes , so he knew the security systems .
... in my opinion , our main suspect .
he's the one who pointed us to maximov .
maximov must have had those men follow her from the yacht .
and made us think that maximov's men ... were the ones who threatened me in the park .
salvador dali learned to replicate all classic art ... before he formed his own unique style .
he had his students replicate the masters ... and put them in maximov's boat .
the paintings and the culprit have been destroyed .
case closed .
why didn't i think to have those fragments carbon dated .
if we can find the original paintings , we are home free , babe .
are you painting again?
don't look .
it's not ready .
humidity .
how could i have been so blind?
is that it?
that's one of them .
bad news .
the americans are here .
do you want me to take care of it?
no .
wait , don't hurt anyone , okay?
i have a better way .
thank god .
i thought they were lost forever .
i can't wait to see the look on victor's face .
rubio owes you an apology , big time .
he does .
we make a pretty good team .
always did .
i'm very glad you're here .
you're my girl .
nothing's ever gonna change that , right?
the story of my life .
hello .
i understand you have something precious of mine .
so i was forced to take something precious of yours .
hi , mommy .
alison .
are you okay?
of course she's okay .
we're sitting here watching tv .
where's the baby sitter?
i sent her home .
i swear to god if you lay one hand on my daughter .
what do you think i am?
i won't hurt her .
just do as i say .
met me at el tibidabo in one hour .
bring the paintings .
come alone .
no cops .
and especially , no husband .
hello?
come with me .
don't be frightened .
everything will be okay .
let's go .
the paintings?
damn .
go .
get rid of him .
go .
is it worth it , daniel?
threatening a child?
you left me no choice .
if i hadn't taken her , you would have gone to the police .
what does it matter?
you're finished anyway .
no .
without the paintings , they have no evidence .
stay here .
come on .
how can you live with yourself?
your students are dead .
that was all fernando's doing .
i swear .
i didn't find out until it was too late .
i never meant for things to turn out this way .
why did you do it?
the money?
no .
a career .
i know i can be an artist .
and this is my last chance .
and now with my patron's help , i might stop teaching and ...
who is this mystery patron , daniel?
doesn't matter now anyway .
like you said .
no evidence .
alison , run .
mommy .
bruce .
daddy .
you .
both of you .
come here .
it was you?
all along?
that's what i love about you , sandra .
you are quick .
you stole your own painting ... so they wouldn't suspect you when you stole the others .
so you recruited daniel and his students?
and got me to come to barcelona so you could frame me for it?
you're my scapegoat .
the police are very tenacious .
and the best way to close a case is to give them a culprit .
all this for a bunch of stupid paintings .
why?
why?
because human life is temporary , sandra .
these paintings ... are forever .
daniel .
i'll take care of these loose ends .
we have the paintings .
they can't prove a thing .
i mean , there's no need ...
they know , daniel .
that's enough .
they are liabilities .
daniel .
please don't do this .
you're not this person .
i know you .
don't be a fool , man .
think of your future .
your immortality .
i won't let you do this , victor .
now get the paintings .
now .
or i'll shoot the child first .
you don't wanna see your daughter die .
all right .
move .
all right .
good girl .
now hand them over .
you want your paintings , victor?
go get them .
no .
allie , run .
no .
bruce , honey , are you okay?
yeah .
mommy , can we go home now?
yes , sweetheart .
we're gonna go home .
jesus christ , i'm shot .
