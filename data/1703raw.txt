'it was the last time annie and i saw them alive . '
when death claims the life of our children ... .. we are left with too many questions .
how do we make sense of the feelings we're left with?
the gospel according to luke , even the first corinthians , tell us of the extraordinary paradise that awaits us .
4 years later
the lucky winner is ... jacobs !
stacy jacobs .
hello , stacy , i'm dr nielsen .
hi .
ah , too late .
nice stream .
he's feeling better .
he waited 10 years .
stacy jacobs !
what were you thinking?
it's all right .
my kid used to say , " what's the difference?
you weren't looking anyway .
you like rabbits?
yes?
then go like this .
good .
we've given her mrls and ...
whoa !
wild rabbit .
watch out .
and also a cat scan , i believe .
look at that .
you have more pictures than a supermodel .
do you ever wear glasses?
no , she doesn't need glasses .
does your head hurt a lot?
all the time .
cup your hand , cover your nose and mouth and breathe .
mrs nielsen on four .
that's my wife .
if you can do it longer than she can talk , that's an achievement .
christy , i've got a meltdown .
ok , take a breath .
eight pieces from germany never arrived .
i've gotta choose replacements the night before the opening , re hang them , re light them and i ...
ok , focus .
it's our double d anniversary .
i'm ruining it .
double d , yeah .
i'm sorry , i can't leave here .
'i'm sorry . '
tell you what , how about this ...
how about the hudson rivers?
'that gives us three . '
and the hollenbeck ...
'and the , uh , hennik 16 , 19 and 23 ... 'and the bridge .
but they're in fairfield ...
i don't have anybody to send .
i'll get them and take 'em to the gallery .
huh ...
you'd do that for me?
only if you're incredibly grateful .
that's a chance to show yours .
it's very sexy .
ok , weirdo ...
i'll be home late , but i'll be home .
i love you , bella .
i love you , too .
bye .
do you like art?
my wife fixes paintings and also makes some .
to me , paintings are the most important things in the world ... next to your brain .
you feel better , don't you?
migraines ...
'i said , " i love you , bella .
'i'll always remember that .
'at least i got to say it . '
you all right?
i think so .
i'm a doctor .
don't move .
chris?
hm?
do you know what's happened?
i had a bad piece of fish before bed .
who are you?
a doc?
are you operating on me?
who are you?
why can't i see you?
ginger , you see me?
she does .
dogs are different .
can you see me now?
why are you so blurred?
i'll get clearer .
confused how you got home so fast?
dreams don't deal in time .
time doesn't count .
you've died , chris .
doc , if i were dead , would i need you to tell me?
i guess you do .
everyone's different .
i wish everybody would go home .
why do i see everyone?
everybody but ...
you don't wanna see me .
you don't wanna be dead .
the kids were so young .
you want to remember your kids .
when they were still alive .
when she goes to the hospital , i'm going too .
marie ...
katie's not ...
katie's not going there to get better .
sugar?
they're gonna give her a shot
and she'll fall asleep .
you're going to kill my dog?
i'm going to help her die , yes .
honey , she hurts very ... .. badly and nothing can help her .
i'm going to stop that ,
because i love her .
you're killing my dog .
you get angry .
death does that .
what'll happen to her?
um ...
she'll go where we all go .
and how can that be bad?
come on , dad !
oh , my leg !
thanks for not listening to mom .
about what?
just coming out here .
this whole day .
she didn't want us doing this , because of ... grades and stuff .
your mother and i talked .
we always listen to each other .
so , i mean , what'd you talk about?
about taking you out of head royce .
the school is wrong for you .
while this is a time ...
while this is a time ...
where are we now?
maybe you won't want to stay .
this is your funeral .
what am i on?
you're real fuzzy .
at least you're willing to see yourself .
you're losing your fear .
fear?
that you disappeared .
you didn't .
you only died .
a woman ... who lost her children just four years ago .
every day in the lord's prayer .
celia ... come on .
whoa .
shhhhh ...
this one is a present ... for me .
it's our double d anniversary .
kind of our special day .
it's her version of our place .
your place?
where we first met .
where we were going to retire , i guess .
live out our lives .
be old farts together .
right there .
that's our dream house .
that one's me , i guess .
the blurry one is annie .
looks a little familiar , doc .
the funeral is over .
why is this going on past the funeral? .
'dear diary ,
'i'm writing because my shrink is crazier than me .
'he thinks you're therapy .
'if two babies can hammer me into a psycho ward ,
'what'll i do with this?
'he's so stupid .
'he thinks he pulled me through the breakdown
'when it was only christy .
'always .
only chris . '
jesus ...
'i was looking through his postcards .
'paintings were his obsession .
'he used art to love me , to help me .
'to keep us always together .
i'm here , babe .
i still exist .
you're thinking of me .
keep thinking of me .
come on , with me .
you were always with me .
the people who finished each other's sentences .
remember us?
i still exist .
i still exist !
just write it down .
write it down .
this is chris .
this ... is ... chris .
i ... " still ...
exist .
read it .
read it .
christ , when does it end?
christ , when does it end?
there's no rules , chris .
it ends when you want .
where were you?
someplace else .
you think i'm a figment of your imagination?
she's real .
you're real .
it's all real .
that's the point if there is one .
it's over when you stop wanting to hurt her .
forever ...
don't worry , baby ...
i'm not leaving you alone .
i'm not going anywhere .
goodbye , babe .
katie , it's you !
you're young again !
come here , katie !
katie , katie !
come on , hey !
boy , i screwed up .
i'm in dog heaven .
a place where we all go can't be bad , can it , girl? .
maybe i'm not in your heaven after all !
maybe you're in mine !
annie !
what the hell have you done?
that's not how you use a stethoscope !
albert lewis?
last time you saw me i was 63 , on a cardiac ward !
you thought i was old and decrepit , huh?
talking about " ah , can't go on !
who wants to be 63 throughout eternity?
look at you on the water !
well , hello !
come on ... walk along , feel the beat !
dancing on water !
smooth as ever !
and that was you ... just now , when ... when i died .
i thought you recognised me , because you called me " doc " .
me being your favourite doc .
could you lend me a hand?
i'm up to my ass in problems again .
oh , chris ...
come here .
you are still kinda ugly .
you taught me a lot , chief .
nice place you got here .
no , no .
nice place you got here .
me?
sure , you're making all this .
we're insecure at first , so we need safety and comfort .
we all paint our surroundings , but you use real paint !
there's so much here she didn't paint .
like that bird .
annie gave you a start , like holding onto handrails .
you're creating a world .
from your imagination , from anything you want .
why doesn't it move?
it will when you want it to .
oh hoh !
you go , boy !
can i make it dive?
you're the painter !
it's your world !
look at it go !
how about turquoise wings?
turquoise !
and a little mauve , all right !
i didn't do that .
no , i did .
when we're together it's like dual controls .
can i make elephants fly?
didn't annie paint a house?
yeah , it's our dream house .
just a stroll across the water .
let's take the shortcut .
nice shortcut .
it's easy , look at me !
i'm gonna drown .
you're already dead .
am i ... am i really here?
what do you mean by " you "?
your arm or your leg?
partly .
really?
and if you lost your limbs?
i'd still be me .
what is the " me "?
my brain , i suppose .
your brain?
your brain is a body part .
like your fingernail or your heart .
why is that you?
because " i " am a voice in my head .
the part that thinks , feels .
that is aware that i exist .
so if you're aware you exist ... then you do .
that's why you're still here .
no windows .
what aren't you ready to see , i wonder?
drink it .
think it's coffee and it will be .
ok .
it's coffee ...
paint !
acrylic .
why is it so hard?
what?
your brain is meat .
it rots and disappears .
you thought that's all there was to you?
like you're in your house now .
you're in your house , you aren't your house .
the house falls down , you walk away .
but i rebuilt , huh?
you see your body because you like seeing one .
we're seeing what we choose to see .
let me show you something .
ha !
it's real .
where is the paint?
you don't need it any more .
this is your world now .
thought is real .
physical is the illusion .
ironic , huh?
where's god in all this?
he's up there .
somewhere ...
shouting down that he loves us .
wondering why we can't hear him .
you think?
drink your coffee .
needs milk .
don't push your luck .
'what do you think , christy?
'what do you think , christy?
'right here .
'like this?
you think?
'they say we live in our minds anyway .
'having you with me , like this , keeps me happy .
'why do i believe you can hear me?
'why do i think you can see this? '
what's that purple tree?
i never saw that .
let's look .
think you can get there in eight seconds?
eight seconds?
over there?
yeah , i just need a little incentive .
yeah ...
i can fly ...
no !
can't i do what i want?
i think you'd be more comfortable keeping it real .
think of running fast , like the road runner , ok?
i can handle this .
adios , muchacho .
oh ...
wait !
chris !
annie !!
i bet you're thinking " oh , shit ! " now !
aaaaahhhh !
yeah !
go , boy !
go , chris , go !
albert !
albert !
it's completely new .
the canvas was blank when i was alive .
how can i see this drawing after i'm dead?
for an expert you look pretty surprised .
you two .
a long courtship?
no , actually .
from the first moment ...
soulmates .
it's extremely rare , but it exists .
like twin souls .
tuned in to each other .
apparently , even in death .
you're reaching each other through her painting .
it's nothing i've ever seen .
'you can't see it , can you?
'and you never will . '
i love you !
whose footprints are these?
don't ask , you put 'em here .
annie ...
annie !
chris !
fantasy is not what you need .
no , you're right .
i need annie .
that'll change in time .
oh , come on , einstein !
time's not on my watch any more !
time does not exist here !
wherever it went , it won't make me need annie less .
you'll feel differently , and so will she .
man ...
you don't know us .
wish i did .
marie ...
marie !
look , it's tigger !
it's my daughter's !
katie tore it up once , and ...
she's here , right?
where is she?
here " is big enough for all to have their universe .
that's not why you haven't seen them yet , is it?
what does that mean , buddha?
i wanna see my children , albert !
when you do , you will .
does that hurt?
mm mm .
that?
mm hm .
how about that?
i'm gonna keep doing this till you tickle .
you've got a fever .
it's going down , though .
don't you have to go somewhere?
wanna play chess?
i could teach you .
would you teach me that?
excuse me .
albert has to work .
he asked me to meet with you .
will that be all right?
leona ...
that's a very beautiful name .
he said you've been isolated .
do you wanna see others?
perhaps a city?
i would , but travel makes me nauseous .
close your eyes .
i didn't mean forever .
what do you think?
i'm a little under dressed .
you look fine .
till now you've been painting your world .
this is mine .
in our city across the river we have to have a common vision .
so , there's work .
mm hm .
i like that .
albert is sort of a missionary .
he saves lost souls .
like me .
hardly .
they are the ones who can't get here .
you mean , from hell? .
in a way .
it's not what you think .
my work is with animals .
katie is an old friend .
'dearest christy .
'i don't know how this day unravelled .
'i was proud of how i held together through this afternoon .
'but , coming home , i began to lose it .
'if i had walked out that night ,
'you wouldn't have been in the tunnel .
'a whole family lost in car crashes .
'enough to make a person buy a bike . '
where are they going?
to help others be reborn .
really?
reincarnation?
albert says to cheer you up .
you have difficulty ...
.. losing my wife , yeah .
and your children?
they died years ago .
that's why i'm worried about my wife .
they died in a terrible collision .
the nanny was driving .
it wasn't her fault .
and your wife?
my daughter had asked her to drive .
it was a trucker's fault .
but my wife believed that if she'd been driving , her protective instincts would have ...
are you ok?
come on , katie !
where were you just now?
your mind's been wandering all afternoon .
thinking of someone .
your wife must have loved her children very much .
very much .
but you don't have to break in half to love somebody .
tell me a memory of your own .
say , with your daughter .
hey ...
that's somebody else's art .
what's the difference?
you weren't looking anyway .
your move .
is this where we go when we die?
it's a dream , baby .
it's beautiful ,
but you know , dreams ...
.. i know , aren't real .
it's after midnight .
i haven't won yet .
it's your first time .
no , i like that .
means you're not cheating .
and when i win , i really win .
i wanna play till i do .
unless you wanna stop .
no .
let's play till you win .
'she died three months later . '
we played every night .
it meant the world to me .
she never won .
i didn't look like this in the body , you know .
we flew to singapore once .
and ... .. my daddy smiled at the flight attendant who ...
looked like this and wore this name tag .
he said asian women are so ...
lovely ... and graceful ...
and intelligent .
he didn't mean only .
i know .
it was something he said .
and i thought , when i grow up , i wanna be that .
you still play chess?
i think i waited for my partner .
'i swear that california is the strangest place .
'they push you into it
'so you can do it before your shrink commits you .
'thoughtful legislation there .
'mine is suspicious .
'another week , he might commit me .
'for my own safety .
'i had the husband i was meant to have .
'two spectacular children .
'blessings no one would dare expect from life .
'and the truth is , simply ... 'that it's over .
'just this one loose end to ravel up .
'i didn't get to say goodbye .
you're dead and i blew that .
'i don't get to say goodbye .
'but i'll tell you what
'across whatever distance there is ,
'i send you my love . '
hey .
where were you?
far away .
i got called back .
i was working .
there are no words to thank you .
for finding marie .
is she ok?
she's fine .
you'll see her soon .
she sends her love .
especially now .
we'll go through something very hard right now .
i'm with you .
you're not alone .
annie is dead .
she killed herself .
it's nothing i ever expected .
like i said , you don't know us .
is that an occupational hazard of soulmates?
one's not much without the other?
but she's ok .
because her pain is over .
you don't understand .
she won't cling like me .
when do i see her?
never .
you'll never see her .
suicides go somewhere else .
why are you punishing her?
it's not punishment .
she's suffered enough .
there are no judges or crimes .
everybody's equal .
that's the way things work !
and suicides go to hell? .
no goddamn judgment in that !
you wanna fight?
you can hide from it or understand it .
hell " is for those who don't know they're dead .
they can't realise what they've done or what's happened .
too self absorbed that they ...
self absorbed? !
that doesn't apply to annie , all right?
no , it doesn't .
suicides are different .
they don't go to hell because they're immoral or selfish .
there's a natural order to our journey .
annie has violated that .
she won't face it .
she won't realise , accept what she's done .
she will spend eternity playing that out .
you still say she's in hell .
everybody's hell is different .
real hell is your life gone wrong .
i'm her soul mate .
i can find her .
you don't understand how ...
it's not about understanding !
it's about not giving up .
you said there are no rules .
and the tree?
you were pretty surprised then .
hey , if there are no rules , how can you say all suicides are the same?
i can't , i can't .
ok .
or she doesn't know she's dead?
i can't .
no one has ever seen a suicide brought back !
stick around , chief .
you ain't seen nothing yet .
ok .
you deserve your chance .
we'll find a tracker .
hey !
this the guy who doesn't give up?
anyone tell you too much persistence can get stupid?
constantly .
i hear the same thing .
i also hear i read too slow .
i don't need glasses .
eyes being a figment of my imagination .
you'll hear a lot of smart stuff here .
it's usually right .
don't let it screw you up .
i won't .
your wife love you as strong?
we'll find her .
but when you find her ... nothing will make her recognise you .
nothing will break her denial .
it's stronger than her love .
in fact , reinforced by her love .
you can say everything you long to say .
including goodbye .
even if she can't understand it .
you'll have the satisfaction that you didn't give up .
that has to be enough .
get me there .
i decide what's enough .
when do we leave?
close your eyes .
albert's a sweet kid .
he is that .
there's a tenderness i never knew in life .
i didn't know him when he was young .
were you proud of your own kids?
of course .
that's an easy bullshit answer .
think about it .
i said " of course .
i like this sore point .
it's juice , juice is strong .
it connects .
makes you a better receiver for annie .
she's the transmitter , sending thoughts of you .
what did you do when alive?
you mean the last time?
we can be reborn .
but only if we choose to .
i did the same work ...
you were a shrink !
fairly perceptive .
oh , my god .
you expected physical danger?
what could it do , kill you?
no , in hell , there's real danger .
of losing your mind .
because he's drowning , that's why .
he's 13 years old !
i know .
he needs to hang out with his friends .
veg out in front of the tv , read a fucking book he likes !
he doesn't wanna let me down?
no , it's worse ...
he's so into you , he feels he's letting himself down .
he thinks he's shit .
how sick is that?
how can you take me out of school? .
how can you?
this is my life !
don't you think i can make it?
if i really dig in ...
you have to show me more !
come on !
you're blowing it , ian !
i'm not you !
shipwrecks ...
what is this place?
the gateway to hell .
how are we doing?
picking up any signals?
actually ... not a ripple .
that's because i was thinking of somebody else .
it's a slap in the face when you see kids taking a test and they're breezing through it .
and for you it just ... kinda goes .
every day i see ... how i'm not as good as you and everyone else .
but that doesn't mean i give up .
hey !
cerberus " the guardian .
how do you feel? .
more than i want you in and out of school ,
i want to know how you feel at night .
real scared .
i know i believe in you .
if i was going through fucking hell ,
i'd only want one person in the goddamn world with me .
there's a man ...
ian never got to know .
the man ... he was growing up to be .
he's a good looking , clear eyed young fella ... .. about 25 .
i can see him .
he's the type of guy men want to be around .
because he has integrity , you know?
he has character .
you can't fake that .
and he's a guy women want to be around , too .
because there's tenderness in him .
respect ...
loyalty ...
courage ...
and women respond to that .
makes him a terrific husband .
i see him as a father .
that's where he really shines .
see , when he looks in his kid's eyes and the kid knows that his dad really sees him he sees who he is .
then that child knows that he is an amazing person .
he's quite a guy ... .. that i'll never get to meet .
'i wish i had . '
let's do it !
come on , she could be in there !
no !
no !
don't !
don't ...
don't do this !
your mother's not in there , ian !
your mom is not in there , son .
there's not another man i'd go through hell with .
elevator to hell .
going up .
come on .
so long .
wish us luck .
i'm coming .
i'm not giving you a choice .
what are you saying?
since you suspected albert was your son ,
you lost your wife's signal .
i'll concentrate harder !
you're all mouth and no chops !
all you're good for is she loves you .
your boy is a distraction .
damn shrinks !
you love shoving people around !
we're going .
his last chance .
he's never been in such a place .
you haven't .
it's better watching one than two .
you want him clear?
screw him , ian !
he doesn't know us !
he's not family !
no !
i'm not leaving him !
if he never sees her?
never says goodbye?
we do it without him .
let's go !
dad !
no !
listen to me .
when you get there , don't listen to him .
you find her ... and you bring her back .
you can do it .
i believe in you .
d'you ever think why i chose to be albert?
he was the only guy you ever listened to .
listen to me now !
think about mom !
think about what happened when we died !
think about what you said to her to bring her back !
'think about mom . '
'think about when we died . '
i'm teaching myself to smoke .
the doctors call it an affirmation of life .
well , it beats the statue thing .
you said " divorce " .
you got my attention .
i think that we're too different ... .. to stay together .
i mean ...
well , for one thing , why aren't you in here?
why didn't you go crazy?
your children died .
i remember .
i remember the silence in the house .
i thought i was supposed to be strong .
for me?
for me .
for us .
just on general principles .
i loved them , annie .
but they're gone .
you've got a choice .
life either goes on ... or not .
and you choose life .
sometimes , when you win , you lose .
this hasn't been a good day .
c'mon .
it's our private deck .
i never took more than 30 percent from clients .
this must be it .
mister !
i'm here !
i'm coming !
watch where you're stepping !
sorry !
excuse me !
anybody got a cure?
no , man !
excuse me .
sorry .
welcome .
welcome , son .
papa?
son .
papa?
you're close .
welcome .
no .
welcome , welcome .
you're not my dad , sorry .
it's all right .
they never come .
don't worry .
it's only a matter of time .
you don't think it looks like a dog?
you always take the easy ones .
that one looks like a 24 piece dining set .
with a soup tureen .
or a bunny rabbit .
a very complex bunny rabbit .
or a rubenesque breast .
you always think they're breasts .
all kinds of breasts .
i love them .
yours .
we'll be late for the dance !
what's the rush?
i know what you're doing .
this is all just a stall .
i know why you don't wanna go .
busted .
why don't you dance just once?
other husbands are as clumsy .
oh , thank you .
it's just that when everybody's dancing i feel like i'm alone ... .. in a sea of faces .
ahhh !
angel falls ...
it's a little expensive , yeah .
but it's our first double d.
shouldn't it be incredible?
i've never seen anything like it .
that's my role .
to bring adventure to your life .
you ... taught me ... the only thing i should always remember .
which is?
i forgot .
oh yeah , oh yeah , oh yeah ...
it was , never give up .
never give up .
never .
she's here .
you found her .
impressive .
that jolt of fear for her .
it connected .
my god , is that our house?
it's like our home .
don't think that .
it's an illusion .
the whole place ... her illusion .
suicides can get tortured , committed to punishing themselves .
don't push her that way .
you want to see her .
tell her what's in your heart .
and then go .
no pressure .
wait !
i knew you'd find her .
you're a competitor .
how d'you know the first thing about me?
you called your son albert .
who is that?
first doctor i interned under .
he was like a father to me .
his words were gold .
a brilliant mind .
what did he practice before turning to pediatrics?
child psychia ...
.. psychiatry .
and he was always ... a slow reader .
but these ... used to be rimless .
and the rest of me ... used to be black .
you know why we chose to look different?
me , the children?
package doesn't count?
one's as good as ...
no .
the old roles of authority .
who's the teacher , who's the father ... gets in the way of who we really are ... to each other .
i've waited for years for a chance to watch out for you .
and i'm watching out for you now .
but this isn't like the rest of hell .
you've got no defence against annie .
if losing yourself or being swallowed by hell itself could save her , i'd be there cheering you on .
you've got your children back now .
they need you .
three minutes ...
any more , you could lose your mind .
how can you lose your mind?
once her reality becomes yours , there's really no way back .
'think about mom . '
'what you said to bring her back . '
hello?
your door's open .
sorry , i didn't mean to scare you .
who ... who are you?
i'm your neighbour .
i bought the gorman's place two months ago .
i just moved in .
i never heard they sold their place .
you're annie nielsen , right?
they told me a lot about you .
like what?
what did they say?
that you're a very talented artist and ... work for a museum , right?
and ... you're a widow .
mrs gorman admires your roses ... very much .
they were so handsome .
but now there's no water pressure in the neighbourhood .
there's no electricity and no gas .
there are other things missing , too .
like clean clothes and books i want to read .
and , um ... some of my favourite paintings i have to work on .
aahh !
what is it?
they're everywhere now !
i got it !
it's gone .
thank you .
you're welcome .
you say your paintings are missing .
some of my most precious panels .
the ones that remind me .
remind me of my husband and my children .
that's why i never leave .
because they might return?
i hope that's true with all my heart .
it's not , you know .
when you're dead , you disappear .
my wife committed suicide after our children died .
after i ...
she was the loveliest person .
don't you think that's sad?
don't you have to leave?
no .
but if you want me to go ...
i do .
the last day i saw my wife it was our anniversary .
aren't you leaving?
in a minute .
i was sticking around in case there was another problem .
it wasn't a wedding anniversary .
it was a very special kind of day ... .. no one else knows about .
i need to talk to you .
and you don't have to respond .
this is a one way ticket ... for me .
my hanging around here is not helping you .
and it's killing me .
today is kind of a d day .
d " for decision , i guess .
about divorce .
that'd be two d's , wouldn't it?
i stand corrected .
look what happens when you don't say anything for a month .
cindy called .
she said everything is waiting for you .
the artists and curators will see you when you're better .
and i told her ... it was the museum and one of those meetings that kept you from driving that day .
and if you went back , it'd mean you weren't sorry , you weren't wrong and you'd be betraying your children .
she called you crazy and i called her a bitch !
and i hung up !
that didn't go very well !
what's true in our minds is true .
whether some people know it or not .
that's when i realised i'm part of the problem .
not because i remind you .
but because i couldn't join you .
so i left you alone .
don't give up , ok?
ok .
ok .
it's ok .
so you reconciled .
that's very romantic .
she still killed herself .
she gave up .
there's nothing wrong with it .
her husband thought so .
he was a coward !
being strong , not giving up ... that was his place to hide .
he pushed away the pain so hard , he disconnected himself from the person he loved the most .
sometimes , when you win , you lose .
when he saw his children again ...
i thought your children were dead .
you can see the dead .
in your dreams .
if you want to .
i wanna see christy .
i can show you .
it's not hard .
all you have to do ... it's like painting a picture .
we do it together .
just close your eyes .
remember where you were married?
christy !
christy ...
who else would you be marrying in your dreams?
i missed you .
annie ...
this is real .
the man in the garden .
it's me .
no !
no !
whoever you are , did you think you could take him from me?
i'm sorry , babe .
there's some things i have to say .
i've only got a few moments left .
i'm sorry for all the things i'll never give you .
i'll never buy you another meatball sub with extra sauce .
and always the big one .
i'll never make you smile .
i just wanted us to be old together .
two old farts laughing at each other as our bodies fell apart .
together at the end .
by that lake in your painting .
that was our heaven , see?
there's lots of things to miss .
books ... naps ... kisses ... and fights .
oh , god , we had some great ones !
thank you for every kindness .
thank you for our children .
for the first time i saw them .
thank you for being someone i was always proud to be with .
for your guts , for your sweetness .
for how you always looked , for how i always wanted to touch you .
god , you were my life .
i apologise for every time i failed you .
especially this one .
didn't you think i'd make it?
you were in there a while .
took me a while to realise you were right .
nothing you can do could help her .
this trip was for you .
did you come close ...
.. to losing it?
oh , yeah .
pushed it right to the edge .
that's why i had to come out now .
i'm giving up .
not the way you think .
go home , al .
will you tell my children i love them?
and i won't leave their mother .
where are we headed?
in one minute i won't know you any better than you'll know me .
but we'll be together .
where we belong .
good people go to hell because they can't forgive themselves .
i know i can't .
but i can forgive you .
for killing my children?
and my sweet husband?
for being so wonderful , a guy would choose hell over heaven , just to hang around you .
not because i remind you ... but because i couldn't join you .
sorry i left you alone .
don't give up , ok?
christy?
christy .
what happened to this place?
it's cold .
christy?
god , no !
no , no , no , no !
don't give up !
don't give up !
christy !
don't give up !
don't , don't give up !
christy !
stay with me , don't give up ...
christy !
hey !
remember me?
sometimes , when you lose ... you win .
how did we get here?
travel here is like everything else .
it's in your mind .
you only have to close your eyes .
if you know where you're going ...
looks like we did .
where you were ...
i tried everything .
nothing worked .
until ... you tried trailing me .
what some folks call impossible ... is what they haven't seen before .
excuse me , lady .
ready for that surprise i promised?
yeah .
that's not the surprise !
mommy?
i want us to grow old together .
can we do that here?
mm hm .
i want it all .
as long as it's with you .
it will be .
but what about going back?
being reborn?
that's the one thing we can't have here .
finding each other all over again .
falling in love .
make different choices .
try again .
yeah .
avoid sharp objects .
don't worry about the kids .
they'll be here .
they want us to go .
a human life is just a heartbeat here .
and we'll all be together .
forever .
how will i find you?
i found you in hell .
i'll find you in jersey .
'when i was young ...
i met this beautiful girl by a lake . '
# we follow the river
# we follow the river
# down into the stream
# that's where my dream began
# i left my worries
# to the people who stare
# and dreamed without a care
# that i'd always be beside you
# to watch the day and night
# and we'll listen to the sunrise
# and feel its glowing light
# and peace will come inside
# so quiet
# wherever we're going
# i don't know
# for a million years our love keeps growin '
# the mystery deepens
# day by day
# but trust my love and hear me say
# that i'll always be beside you
# to watch the day and night
# and we'll listen to the sunrise
# and feel it's glowing light
# and peace will come inside
# so quiet
# peace will come inside
# so quiet
# yes , i'll always be beside you
# to watch the day and night
# and we'll listen to the sunrise
# and feel its glowing light
# and peace will come inside
# so quiet
# yes , peace will come inside
# so quiet #
