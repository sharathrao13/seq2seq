give to an absent minded banker ,
bouduller celebrated the fact of they have exposed count olaf while they crossed the cold surface of the river lakrimoss .

klaus because you made that with this poor man?
i apologize immense .
he/ she doesn't have importance .
he is only badly a little of the insides .
i work with this since i lost my leg .
because it is that i didn't wait one more hour go swim , reason?

what will have taken to this desperate action .
acto is badly written .

one of his/ her happiness was the grammar , because it is that he/ she has so many mistakes?
if it was about to jump of the window maybe also he/ she had some mistakes .
understand that i am much happier like this .
as my last will in will , i leave you under the care of captain cham .
a kind and honest man .
this it was his/ her plan .
he/ she forced her to write her this ticket and later it pushed her/ it for the window .
no , it is not a ticket suicda .
it is a message .
this should have other letters here .

already east some book about navigation?
klaus had already read 15 books about navigation , and two books about location .
but a thing is to do in theory , in prctica it is different .
very a little he/ she could have them mixture for this crossing curdled digs even .
but as the storm passed , and the waters calmed ,
boudullers were not able to to leave of feeling a certain satisfaction .
a rare moment of happiness , in their always unhappy lives .
they had gotten , and if his/ her guardian didn't get to save them , then they would save his/ her guardian .
aunt josephin .
aunt josephin .
is he/ she here?
children got , they deciphered the tracks in my ticket .
we are happy that is well .
it was so horrible , count olaf it forced me to do that will and later he/ she almost killed to have me to give all those grammatical mistakes .
then they did bring foods?
foods?
we have just left a storm .
is it later?
as wait that we get to live in this grotto they were not brought food .
to live at the grotto?
no aunt josephin , has to return connosco .
you leave us in will to captain cham , you are the only proof that it is lie .
no , he/ she is very dangerous children .
very dangerous?
you are our guardian , it is right to take comta of us .
he/ she knows aunt josephin , curdled digs is sells .
soon people will come here to see him/ it and maybe some of those people buys him/ it .
aunt josephin what the one means this?
where did you find that?
in his/ her room .
fires .
because it was him to investigate her/ it fires?
all be millstones .
the uncle monty ...
our parents .
they were ours lead .
children , in the world there are good and bad people .
the ones that begin the fires and the ones that turn off them .
who is to do this?
is olaf?
i already said too much , their parents knew the answer .
and look what happened with them .
our parents?
what did they say?
we should not have left that grotto .
we can still return behind , i take a risk .
what did our parents say?
we will die .
the something?
they are the beings .
i think it is a good thing none of us to eat there is some time .
the skull split .
klaus the one what make?
we are to sink , to sink , to sink .
he/ she has a boat there .
we are here .
for more unpleasant that the beings could be , there was something still more unpleasant , that he/ she appeared of the thick fog .
hello , hello , hello .
i felt his/ her lack .
i think that percisam of my help .
you are that will need when we arrive city , the aunt josephin will count everything .
then i will be arrested and you will live happy forever with your guardian .
the time will pass to invent things , to read and to gnaw .
the world becomes an i besiege harmonious , everyone to sing and to dance , as the elfo .
a happy end .
was it that what were waits?
because i find difficult somebody to believe in a woman died .
he/ she won't play in the aunt josephin and she will count to everyone that it happened .
no , no , i don't count anything to anybody , i promise .
please don't throw me for the water .
it can be with the fortune , and with the children .
well vindos on board .
i disappear .
i paint the hair and mute of name .
then it is us?
silence , the adults are talking .
i suppose that i don't have to kill her .
on the other hand his/ her trick in the window it doesn't turn her/ it a very reliable person .
but ...
i can be merciful .
what was?
you committed a grammatical mistake .
thank you for having corrected me .
ready they were already with the idea .
everything did that were able to .
children , are you?
mr. pow are ...
i saved him/ it .
i saved the boy .
conde olaf the one what is making here?
i know that it should not have come , but when i heard that they were in danger had to come .
it seems that it was wrong .
he/ she is a very capable guardian , and i put the children to his/ her responsibility .
it is of law that doesn't inherit anything in case some happens thing ace children .
with the relatives 'excepo or you marry .
it is really !
sr pow already spoke to him/ her about the our new piece?
which is his/ her idea , because it is that we entered in the piece?
here he/ she says that if the people are married they are entitled to our whole money .
but that is only a piece , he is not able to to inherit the money marrying with me in a piece .
the marriage has to be accomplished for a priest , he/ she says right here .
they are prepared for our guest?
you are the bride , i am the judge .
who is the fianc?
judge , doesn't understand , the piece is real .
which is the word that i seek?
remember judge has to say everything as if it was a true marriage .
because it is that he/ she had to tell me that?
take her for the maquilhagem .
that is ridiculous , violet is 14 years old only , she cannot marry legally .
it can if he/ she has his/ her guardian's permission .
and who is he?
me .
when you say yes and you sign the certificate you will be legally my wife .
i will never say that yes , never .
he/ she leaves her/ it alone .
if he/ she doesn't say that yes , or any thing to get mixed up , she falls .
as he/ she can make that , she is a baby .
he/ she is 14 years old , you should already know that not you can have everything that wants .
you want to be happy , to have a roof and does one besiege her/ it what can call of home?
and the one what i want? !
i want that enormous fortune .
and you will help myself to get what i want .
my public awaits me .
you are not going ahead with this .
i have to do that .
go there , there is always some alternative .
this time no .
he/ she is going klaus , it goes ...
there is always something that she can do .
do wait , what is that?
i came to marry with my bride .
that it begins the marriage .
conde olaf , accepts this woman for his/ her wife in the health and in the disease until that the death separates them?
and you violet accepts this , count olaf as his/ her husband?
i accept .
her no it accepts , no it accepts .
sunny?
and for the invested power , this union will be ...
official .
sunny where the key is?
right hand please .
lament to inform that their parents died in a fire .
there are things that simply they don't happen .
fast .
this ends here .
what is the one?
i am busy .
we have a problem , he/ she looks upward .
it finishes like this this piece .
it was not a piece , the count will kill sunny if i didn't go ahead with the marriage .
they have to hear me , he is only to marry with me to be with the fortune .
that part by chance is true .
violet and i are actually a blessed couple because we were married in an official cerimnia with a judge .
my god that i went me to do .
i apologize , i didn't know ...
we will be like this together .
mr. pow !
his/ her evil one .
arrest him .
with that motivate?
for being a montro ganncioso .
am i a montro?
you are that it is a monster .
these children tried to tell you but you didn't hear , never nobody hears the children .
this paper says that i have the fortune now .
and not there is anything that can do .
what finds , tell me his/ her opinion .
the marriage is not a picnic , and now he/ she is a terrible actor .
we will maintain the calm , if they come here they will go down at my level .
guilty .
i am happy for saying that count olaf it was condemned by several crimes .
bouduller were victorious , they got to unmask the mystery of the fires .
if the justice went so gentile .
count olaf it disappeared after a season in the prison .
as the children , his/ her future was uncertain .
what knew when returning for the car of mr. pow , it is that will go straight ahead .
children don't worry that the authorities will take care of count olav
they never again returned to see that horrible man before we left maybe act time for one more stop
he/ she looks at these whole stamps .
rome , england , some me nor i know where they are .
of who it is?
of the father and of the mother .
it is the letter !
the letter that never arrived
dear children from that we are i/ you had gone have been having a lot of longings , certain events did with that it was slower .
one day when they go older space to know everything on our trips
in heights in that the world can opinion a little friendly and sinister place .
but they believe when we say that the much more of good than of bad .
everything that has do is to seek with force .
and the one that the first view can seem one serializes of bad luck , it can be i begin him/ it of an adventure .
we hoped to arrive soon , but if the letter to arrive before they know that we loved you .
they fill us with pride know that it happens what to happen you three take care some of the other as always they did .
and remember this my wanted and never forget wherever are since they are together you he/ she has your family and they are home .
their parents
to pass the torch is a right of passage that can be of many sort things out . but secalhar the least acquaintance and more supreendente is the vision of an eyeglass
dear reader , there are people in the world no conheem the poverty they are comforted with films of birds to sing and small elfos .
people that know that there is always a mystery for solving , and they worry in researching and to remove conclusions of the proofs .
but this history is not on such people .
this history is on boudullers , and they are the type of people that you/ they know that there is always more any thing .
any thing to invent , to read or to bite , some thing to do .
