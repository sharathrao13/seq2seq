let's go for a ride .
y eah , a ride .
a ride?
y eah , colonel slade , what do you say?
let's go for a ride , huh?
what kind of ride?
y eah , this is a valid oregon driver's license , and we let appropriate customers test drive the testarossa .
but you're 17 and with a blind companion .
that we don't do .
this is a $190, 000 piece of machinery .
i'm not letting it out this door .
how 'bout this one over here?
that's a cabriolet t.
the same deal .
think i'm gonna let an unaccompanied kid get behind the wheel of a $110, 000 car?
he will not be unaccompanied .
i'll be with him .
i'm his father .
you're his father?
y es .
i have an idea .
why don't i take your father for a test drive?
what's your quota , freddie?
don't worry about my quota .
i do well .
how many ferraris you sold this month?
that's not relevant to this discussion .
freddie , the 80s are over .
are you tryin 'to tell me these are just walkin 'outta the store?
this is a ferrari , the finest machinery made in the automobile industry .
if you like it that much , why are you sellin 'it?
i'd love to accommodate you  if this car performs the way i expect it to , you'll get a certified check of $101, 000 and change when in you come tomorrow .
it's $109, 000 , plus $950 , plus tax .
freddie , for you ... 107 all in , plus a case of champagne to go with your leftover turkey .
what do you say?
don't worry about the boy .
he drives so smooth , you can boil an egg on the engine .
when we bring the car back , i'll peel the egg for ya .
listen , you made me laugh , but i can't let the car go out .
want a deposit?
this is not an installment item , sir .
freddie , you're no spring chicken , are ya?
well , you know what they call me at the home office?
the gray ghost .
you know why they still keep me around?
there's no kid here that can move a ferrari like i can .
i'm known from coast to coast like butter and toast .
ask anybody about freddie bisco .
when i get a ferrari ... out the door !
hah !
you just made me laugh .
yeah?
two thousand .
unless you take it , you're gonna make me cry .
i'm a gray ghost too .
see?
this is fun , isn't it?
drop her into neutral .
slide her into second .
pop the clutch .
straight .
hold it right like that .
feel it?
that's straight .
just keep it straight .
keep it straight .
no fun just to keep it straight .
you've got to move a little bit , feel the road .

good bye , charlie .
good bye , colonel .
come here , son .
okay , manny .
george .
george !
i called an open meeting of this institution this morning ... because the incident that occurred this tuesday last ... describes an issue that concerns all of us .
not an isolated case of vandalism , what happened ... is a symptom of the sickness of a society , a sickness which runs counter to the principles ... this school was founded on , a school , among whose graduates two have sat behind the desk in the oval office , in the white house .
baird men have run state departments and investment houses , founded department stores and coached football teams .
our alumni receive their bulletins in ashrams in lndia ... and in palaces in jordan .
we are , in fact , known around the world ... as the cradle of this country's leadership .
a beacon in the nation's  what are you doing here?
got room for me up there , charlie?
but today ,
we are bleeding from disrespect , yeah , i guess so .
give us a hand . disrespect for our values ... and a disrespect for our standards , a disrespect for the baird tradition .
and , as the custodians of that tradition , we are here today to protect each other ... from those who threaten it .
who is this , mr. simms?
uh  this is mr. frank slade ,
lieutenant colonel , united states army , retired .
i'm here in place of charlie's parents .
excuse me?
in loco parentis .
they could not make the trip from oregon today .
and what is your relationship to mr. simms?
is this a courtroom?
closest thing we could manage to it .
then if we're taking oaths , there's a few people i'd like to swear in .
there are no oaths at baird .
we are all on our honor .
larry and franny simms ... are very dear , close friends of mine .
they've asked me to appear here on charlie's behalf .
okay?
happy to have you with us , colonel .
mr. willis .
which mr. willis?
george , junior , sir .
you were in a position last tuesday night ... to see who committed this act of vandalism .
who was it?
well , uh , i have an idea who it was .
no , no , not an idea , mr. willis .
did you see or did you not see?
well ...
i i didn't have my contacts in .
come on .
i was in the library .
i'd taken my glasses off , and i was gonna put my contacts back in .
um ,
i
then i helped simms close up , and the next thing i know , we're outside , and i hear this sound , and i , um , didn't have any time to put my contacts in .
whom , with your limited vision , did you see?
like i say , it was blurry .
uh ,
i can't see without my contacts .
what did you see , mr. willis?
what?
what , you mean definitively?
stop fencing with me , mr. willis !
tell me what you saw !
now , don't hold me to this , but ... no contacts , it's dark ... and everything , i mean
mr. willis !
maybe ...
harry havemeyer ,
trent potter and jimmy jameson .
maybe?
ballpark , best guess .
could you provide us with some detail?
i mean , why don't you ask charlie?
i really think he was closer .
mr. simms .
y es .
you don't wear contact lenses , do you?
no , sir .
with your untrammeled sight , whom did you see?
well , i saw i saw something , but l l i i couldn't say who .
all right .
what was the something you saw?
l i couldn't say .
you couldn't say or you wouldn't say?
well , i just i
i just couldn't say .
i'm  couldn't , wouldn't , shouldn't .
you're exhausting my patience ... and making a mockery of these proceedings .
i will give you one last chance .
the consequences of your response will be dire .
by dire i mean your future will be jeopardized permanently .
now for the last time , what did you see last tuesday night ... outside my office?
i saw somebody .
i saw somebody . " good .
did you see their size and shape?
y eah .
and they were the size and shape of whom?
they were the size and shape
of most any baird student , sir .
i am left with no real witness .
mr. willis's testimony is not only vague , it is unsubstantiated .
the substance i was looking for , mr. simms , was to come from you .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry too , mr. simms , because you know what i'm going to do , inasmuch as i can't punish mr. havemeyer ,
mr. potter or mr. jameson?
and i won't punish mr. willis .
he's the only party to this incident ... who is still worthy of calling himself a baird man .
i'm going to recommend to the disciplinary committee ... that you be expelled .
mr. simms , you are a cover up artist ... and you are a liar .
but not a snitch !
excuse me?
no , i don't think i will .
mr. slade .
this is such a crock of shit !
please watch your language , mr. slade .
you are in the baird school , not a barracks .
mr. simms , i will give you one final opportunity to speak up .
mr. simms doesn't want it .
he doesn't need to be labeled ...
still worthy of being a baird man .
what the hell is that?
what is your motto here?
boys , inform on your classmates , save your hide ; anything short of that , we're gonna burn you at the stake "?
well , gentlemen , when the shit hits the fan , some guys run ... and some guys stay .
here's charlie facin 'the fire , and there's george ... hidin 'in big daddy's pocket .
and what are you doin '?
you're gonna reward george ... and destroy charlie .
are you finished , mr. slade?
no , i'm just gettin 'warmed up .
i don't know who went to this place .
william howard taft , william jennings bryant ,
william tell , whoever .
their spirit is dead , if they ever had one .
it's gone .
you're buildin 'a rat ship here , a vessel for seagoin 'snitches .
and if you think you're preparin 'these minnows for manhood , you better think again , because i say you are killin 'the very spirit ... this institution proclaims it instills .
what a sham .
what kind of a show are you guys puttin 'on here today?
i mean , the only class in this act is sittin 'next to me .
i'm here to tell you this boy's soul is intact .
it's non negotiable .
you know how i know?
someone here , and i'm not gonna say who , offered to buy it .
only charlie here wasn't sellin '.
sir , you're out of order .
i show you out of order .
you don't know what out of order is , mr. trask .
i'd show you , but i'm too old ,
i'm too tired , too fuckin 'blind .
if i were the man i was five years ago , i'd take ... a flamethrower to this place !
out of order?
who the hell you think you're talkin 'to?
i've been around , you know?
there was a time i could see .
and i have seen .
boys like these , younger than these , their arms torn out , their legs ripped off .
but there is nothin 'like the sight ... of an amputated spirit .
there is no prosthetic for that .
you think you're merely sendin 'this splendid foot soldier ... back home to oregon with his tail between his legs , but i say you are ... executin 'his soul !
and why?
because he's not a baird man .
baird men .
you hurt this boy , you're gonna be baird bums , the lot of you .
and , harry , jimmy ,
trent , wherever you are out there ,
fuck you too !
stand down , mr. slade !
i'm not finished .
as i came in here , i heard those words : " cradle of leadership .
well , when the bough breaks , the cradle will fall , and it has fallen here .
it has fallen .
makers of men , creators of leaders .
be careful what kind of leaders you're producin 'here .
i don't know if charlie's silence here today ... is right or wrong ; i'm not a judge or jury .
but i can tell you this : he won't sell anybody out ... to buy his future !
and that , my friends , is called integrity .
that's called courage .
now that's the stuff leaders should be made of .
now i have come to the crossroads in my life .
i always knew what the right path was .
without exception , i knew , but i never took it .
you know why?
it was too damn hard .
now here's charlie .
he's come to the crossroads .
he has chosen a path .
it's the right path .
it's a path made of principle ... that leads to character .
let him continue on his journey .
you hold this boy's future in your hands , committee .
it's a valuable future , believe me .
don't destroy it .
protect it .
embrace it .
it's gonna make you proud one day , i promise you .
how's that for cornball?
nothing can shut them up , sir .
the disciplinary committee will take this matter under advisement ... in closed session .
what are they doin ', charlie?
i think they're going to come to a decision now .
very well .
apparently , that meeting will be unnecessary .
mrs. hunsaker .
the joint student faculty disciplinary committee ... needs no further sessions .
they have come to a decision .
misters havemeyer , potter and jameson ... are placed on probation ... for suspicion of ungentlemanly conduct .
it is further recommended that mr. george willis , jr .... receive neither recognition nor commendation ... for his cooperation .
mr. charles simms is excused ... from any further response to this incident .
whoo ah .
charlie !
last step .
i can always count on you , charlie .
colonel .
