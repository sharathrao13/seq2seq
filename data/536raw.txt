why we gotta come all this way?
why can't the hire the cops to do this bullshit?
is it that always that rough?
believe me , it used to be a lot rougher .
there was a time when ark travel was susceptible to , let s say , major turbulence .
what does he mean?
he means , he went to one galaxy , his ass went to another .
call it a scientific miscalculation .
unbelievable as it may seem ...
uac does make the odd tiny mistake .
marcus pinzerowsky , you call me pinky .
follow me .
where are the personnel who aren t locked down in the lab?
in the atrium .
pinky , put us up .

circle up , men .

who call in the military?
dad , look !
where the fuck are we over here?

when can i start evacuating people out through the ark?
we re at level 5 quarantine , nobody goes anywhere .
ladies ...

the uac science officer assigned to retrieve data from the lab .
sargent .
dr. grimm .
hello john .
hello samantha .
hello samantha !
sarge , this operation is a code red .
we really don t have room for passengers .
excuse me , but i have orders to retrieve data from three service .
anthropology , forensic arkhaeology and genetics .
this is a military operation , doctor .
we re really not here to retrieve your science homework .
ok , i ve got and idea .
why don t you ask your co what your orders are?
to contain and neutralize the threats , to protect the civilians and retrieve ... retrieve uac property .
we're finally done here?
because i ve got a job to do .
if you follow me
you chose this reaper .
is this going to spoil my day?
no , sir .
please tell me you didn't let a fine piece of ass like that get away from you , reaper .
she s my sister .
no shit !
don't do this again , man .
do what?
there s three sections to carmack s lab complex .
arkhaeology , genetics and weapons research .
you test weapons out here?
well , it s a dead planet .
you can test it here where is safe or in your own backyard .
we are primarily an arkheological operation , weapons research is in it's own separate facility ... ... it has nothing to do with dr. carmack s work .
how many inside when the lab shut down?
only doctor carmack s team , that's 6 people .
in one of the carbon dating labs there was an internal phone left off the hook .
did you get any information from there?
open the door .
portman , goat , lead on .
magnesium , chromium , lead , it s all normal .
all clear !
pinky , give us a schematic .
uploading to you now .
<i>carmack s lab is isolated from the rest of the facility . </ i>
<i>the airlock is the only way in or out . </ i>
goat , portman genetics .

so , mac .
what the fuck?
<i> pinky , how are getting us?
jesus , very cool . </ i>
cleared .
where the hell is everybody?
hey !
lock it .
it s clear .
how much time you re gonna need?
30 minutes , tops .
<i>goat , portman ... there's another room to the north .
past genetics . </ i>
copy that .
what the hell is that?
you never did time , portman?
what?
this is a holding cell .
bullshit .
what makes you think that?
touch it .
cause the walls are electrified .
you asshole .
geez !
if they left shit like this going around?
i want to see what they lock up .
bfg
hey , sarge what s the deal with the sister?
reaper s parents are the first team of arkhaeologists to olduvai .
they died on some accident when he was a kid .
she followed in their footsteps and he didn t .
no , what i meant was is she single?
<i>please provide dna verification . </ i>
<i>access denied . </ i>
so , reaper , as in grimm .
are marines sam , not poets .
holly shit !
oh , yeah meet lucy .
lucy , this is my brother john another creature from the long lost past .
you found human remains humanoid .
lucy and her child are our first major find .
we re bringing up more everyday .
you reopened the dig .
i know i should ve told you .
i didn t figure this is a thing i can judge down on a yearly birthday card .
it s been stabilized .
bullshit !
you wanna talk about safe , like you took a desk job?
i m a forensic arkheologist , john , i go where the work is .
is that the only reason you are up here?
wanna know why i m up here?
i il show you , come here .
this is lucy s chromosome profile .
notice anything?
my molecular genetics is a little rusty .
what's the first thing dad taught us to look for?
she's got 24 pairs of chromosomes .
humans only have 23 .
what the other extra pair do?
makes her superhuman .
the extra pair makes her super strong , super fit , super intelligent .
her cells divide 50 times faster meaning she heals almost instantly .
fosile records indicates these people haven't conquered diseases .
we found no genetic disorders , no viruses , no cancers .
so , what?
they re just naturally superiors .
no , no naturally .
see , the earliest remains we found only had 23 .
we suspect this extra chromosome maybe is synthetic .
bioengineered .
it s a long word for a marine .
has it ever bothered you , you could ve spent your life with a microscope instead of a sniper scope?
if they were so smart , how come are so dead?
we don t know .
maybe there's one with time .
you don t shield a baby from time .
<i>we have movement up ahead . </ i>
you stay here , ok?
lock the door .
the fucking door has been ripped open .
there s something in carmack s office .

i m not gonna hurt you .
duke , get him to the infirmary with dr. grimm .
portman , kid ... go to the airlock and dig in .
anything trying to get away from us will get driven straight to you .
now , let s see if we can find the body that goes with that arm .
he's messed up , huh?
a guy like carmack is trained to put logic before emotions?
he's so freaked , uh?
he tears off his own ear?
i tell you ... it's shit like that gets to you , kiddo .
do you have ...?
do you have any?
do i have any?
yeah .

this is what?
oh , god .
have you found anything like this in your archealogical digs?
no .
is there any way this thing came from the outside , from the surface?
the planet is completely dead .
it came from somewhere , lady !
portman , shut up .
the atmosphere on the surface can't support life .
maybe it doesn't need air .
it could have come from another planet or something .
what?
like an alien?
look at that thing !
portman , you need to shut the fuck up !
that's not what we saw .
that's not what goat and i shot at in genetics .
you are telling me there are more of these fucking things?
where are the surface entry points?
there's a pressure door at the end of the north corridor .
destroyer , you , kid and portman get there in a double .
give me an update .
yes , sir .
whatever this thing is ... ... i cannot get back to the ark !
mac , i want you to arm pinky with a weapon ... ... with some st grenades and seal the ark door .

he killed himself .
what you mean he killed himself?
he was already dead !
it's true .
he's dod .
was turning into one of these motherfuckes and killed himself !
we found two more scientists at the dig .
thurman and a baldy guy with glasses .
dr. clay .
did you check their necks?
were there open wounds on their necks?
we were conducting a firefight not an autopsy .
we came up here ... ... to find 6 scientists .
four are known dead ... ... and dr. willits is probably kai somewhere down in that sewer .
the only one missing is dr. carmack .
has dr. carmack showed up yet?
i wish he'd not , allright?
look at the left ear .
son of a bitch !
i think this other one is steve willits .
and i ran the dna to check it against his med records .
what are you people working on up here?
we're analyzing bones ... ... artifacts .
we're not doing anything like this !
then , what the fuck is that? !
must be a genecit mutation .
something enviromental or viral .
i don't know .
and may even be reversible .
it's irreversible .
not necessarily .
dr. carmack's condition is irreversible .
because dr. carmack's condition is that !
he's dead .
kid , you and duke get back to the dig and you make sure those other dead scientists ... ... are really dead .
i've lost four soldiers .
what are you people experimenting with up here?
i'm not gonna ask you again .
i told you .
it's an arkheologycal research center .
you think i'm lying to you .
is that what you're saying?
you think i'm hidding something?
i'm telling the truth .
what were you downloading?
what were you sent to protect?
the research data !
research into what?
<i>subject was injected with study agent at 003 . </ i>
<i>vitals normal ... </ i> <i> ... elevated heart rate , attributable to subject anxiety . </ i>
<i>c24 sucessfully grafted to subject's macro cells at 009 . </ i>

<i>subject moved to protected observation area at 017 . </ i>
<i>subject curtis stale .

why did it take goat and not destroyer?
why carmack and not dr. thurman?
what?
lucy had the 24th chromosome , but she wasn't a monster .
she died protecting her child , not devoring it .
why did the same chromosome that made her superhuman turned stall into a monster?
let's go !
just gimme a minute .
we don't have a minute !
then give me 10 seconds .
this is its tongue .
this , is brain matter from portman .
this is from destroyer .
it's choosing , john .
it's choosing who to infect .
choosing?
how is it choosing?
there genetic are markers for psychotic and violent behavior .
it could be a specific neurotransmitter is picking up on .
a ganglion , latching on to numbers in the dna code link .
a link to what?
evil?
10 percent of the human genoma still unmapped .
some say is the genetic blueprint for the soul .
maybe c24 is what destroyed the population .
it would explain why someone had to build the ark to escape to a new beginning .
some may made superhuman ... ... others monsters .
oh , my god .
we gotta get out of here .
now !
come on !
let's go !
people quarantined at the other side of the ark , they won't be all infected .
what's going on?
sarge is gonna kill'em all .
come on !
we're pulling quarantine , nothing gets to the elevator back on earth .
we cannot let them get to the surface .
if it breaths , kill it .
<i>ark travel complete . </ i>
<i>this is corporal dean portman , with rrts 6 special ops ... </ i> <i> ... at olduvai are 0310 hours .
we've encountered hostile activity . </ i>
<i>require immediate rrts reinforcements . </ i>

<i>ark travel complete . </ i>

sarge , what's your position?
<i>do not kill everybody .
i repeat , do not kill everybody . </ i>
<i>they're not all infected . </ i>
help me .
help me !
please .
<i> do you copy?

clear the rest of the sector , we meet back in the ark chamber .
jesus christ , what the hell are you shooting at?
put the hand in the air?
why do you stand there , you dumb son of a bitch .
help me up !
it's okay .
please , help us .
you don't have to kill all of them .
i don't think everyone is infected or even capable of being infected .
we've orders to contain this threat by any means necessary .
so , let's evacuate the uninfected and blow this place to hell .
and we have orders to protect this facility .
i don't have orders to kill innocent people .
we have to stop anything from getting to the surface .
by any means necessary .
found this little chickenshit hidden in a pile of dead bodies .
and i'm glad to see you , guys .
that thing came right through the door .
i tried to use the grenade but it came at me too fast .
followed me through the ark and started kill everybody .
it's horrible .
there's no wound on his neck .
he's clean .
i'll say who is clean ... ... and who is not .
it wasn't my fault !
hey , i'm not a soldier !
you shouldn't left me there .
sarge !
there's a storeroom to the south .
it's got like 20 people hold up inside of it .
we gotta do something .
your orders were to clear that sector .
is it cleared?
no , i told'em to stay put .
they're okay .
they're just scared shedders .
we kill'em all .
let god sort'em out .
this is wrong ...
son , you don't think !
that's an order .
we're in the field , soldier !
sarge , if nothing's found  you will ... ... obbey the direct order ... ... of your commanding officer .
no .
now !
go to hell .
no !
holy shit !
minus insurrection is punishable ... by death .
it was his first mission !
it's not gonna be my last !
i need soldiers !
i don't need anybody else but soldiers !
throw your weapons !
i mean it !
i have no intentions of being killed by a madman .
drop your weapons !
there's something behind me , isn't it?
on me !
get sam !
wait here !
listen !
withdraw !
withdraw , behind that nano wall !
move !
fuck !
the wall is not closing !
i'm not to put it down .
come on !
no !
how long until they get through?
not long .
you've been hitted !
oh , john .
listen to me , sam .
you're cold .
shivering .
it's important .
that's a nasty grenade .
when they come through ... ... you have to tapping in the button .
john , stay with me .
stay awake .
john , stay with me .
please .
what's that?
c24 .
from carmack's lab .
no !
it could save you .
no way .
forget it .
you're bleeding to death .
oh , sam .
i've done some bad things .
i know you .
you don't know me .
you don't know me .
you're my brother .
i know you .
wait .
wait .
if i turn into one of those things ...
one to the heart , one to the head ...
don't you hesitate , ok?
i won't need to .
<i>i know you .
you're my brother . </ i>
sam?
sam .
you're alive .
don't talk .
last man standing , reaper .
i think she needs medical attention .
look , can you get to the elevator?
i'm not sure .
try .
where are the survivors kid found?
i took care of that problem .
quarantine is almost over .
power should be back in any minute .
you killed the kid .
we're all killers , reaper .
is what they pay us for .
<i>quarantine complete . </ i>
<i>elevators back online . </ i>
it finished .
i'd just say let's go outside and get some fresh air .
are you gonna shoot me?
yeah , i was thinking about it .
what you've got left?
half a clip .
you?
i've got ... one round .
semper fi , motherfucker !
faithful to the core , john .
