your first visit alone .
just make sure she has what she needs , and help out around the house .
it's yoko's case , but she didn't show up for work this morning .
i can't get her on the phone .
she must be sick or something .
and she has the damn house key .

her daughter in law doesn't work , so she'll probably be there .

hi .
detective nakagawa , i need to speak with you .
the woman who was murdered in that house three years ago knew this man .
he committed suicide the morning after she died .
i don't believe he killed himself .
i don't understand .
what's happening?
three years ago ... three of my colleagues , my friends ... began investigating a case .
two died mysteriously , and one disappeared .
they had been investigating the murders at that house .
are you saying the detectives died because of that house?
i've been in that house .
so have you !
it is said in japan ... that when a person dies in extreme sorrow or rage ... the emotion remains ... becoming a stain upon that place .
the memory of what happened repeats itself there .
death becomes a part of that place ... killing everything it touches .
once you have become a part of it ... it will never let you go .
i'm sorry .
