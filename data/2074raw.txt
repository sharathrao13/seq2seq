yes .
yes .
yes .
please .
please .
don't worry .
don't worry .
it's utter chaos around here .
and i'm terrified that we're running out of time .
am i trying to be too perfect?
oh , but i want it to be so exquisite .
so do we .
but we're trying to be too exquisite .
why not aim for the stars?
good morning .
good morning .
we do need some answers on the flowers .
ah , yes , freesia , freesia .
everywhere freesia .
daddy loves freesia .
good morning .
good morning .
oh .
hello .
hi .
lights?
" lights .
not too bright and not too dark .
i'm looking for a saffron glow , sort of tea dance '20s .
if food is the prose of a party , then lights are its poetry .
it works .
if food is the prose of a party , lights are its poetry .
i like that .
if music were the food of love , play on .
i'm going out of my mind .
good morning , mr. parrish .
what do you think of all this , helen?
it's gonna be beautiful .
and allison says the president may come .
the president's got better things to do than come to my birthday party .
like what?
daddy?
do you have a minute?
good morning , allison .
not much more .
big day in the big city .
what's on your mind?
fireworks .
we are constructing the number 65 on the barge .
mm hmm .
archers from the state college of new paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it .
when it catches fire , it will give us the effect of a viking funeral , but with none of the morbidity .
the hudson river authority says that for you , they'll make a special dispensation .
but , of course , there will be an overtime bill ... for the poughkeepsie fire department .
so , what do you think?
good?
no good?
allison , i trust you .
this is your thing .
but it's your birthday .
i hate arrows .
they make me nervous .
good morning , dad .
good morning , honey .
morning .
morning .
you're " honey . " i'm " allison .
oh .
dad , drew called from the helicopter , and they're still two minutes away .
drew's aboard?
mm hmm .
he wanted to ride back down with you .
why don't you sit down , relax , and get some food in that flat tummy of yours .
are you coming?
no .
you've got patients to attend to .
i've got three hysterical chefs , one of whom loves truffles , the other one hates truffles , and the third one doesn't even know what truffles are .
i hate parties .
but , daddy , calm down .
you're gonna love it .
i swear .
isn't it enough to be on the earth for 65 years without having to be reminded of it?
no .
will you relax?
i know it's a big deal day .
how'd you know that?
drew told me .
does he tell you everything?
i hope so .
you like him , don't you?
yep , i guess so .
i don't want to interfere , but , uh ...
then don't .
well , here comes our boy now .
shall we?
okay .
hello , beautiful .
hi .
good morning , drew .
thanks for coming up .
well , big day .
wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff .
any thoughts , last minute refinements , variations , anything?
thoughts , no .
i did hear a voice last night .
a voice?
in my sleep .
what'd it say?
" yes .
yes to the deal?
maybe .
who knows?
you know how voices are .
hmm?
i thank you , delia .
okay , let's go .
delia , your pen .
hi , bill .
how you doin '?
morning , quince .
i'm doin 'great , and you?
oh , i'm great .
this is it , " b day .
huh?
sorry .
bontecou day .
we're gonna close ... with big john .
look at you , bill .
you're all cool as a cat .
over at bontecou's , i'll bet he's just shittin 'in his pants .
remember , everybody , big meeting tonight at daddy's .
dinner .
you , too , drew .
we have lots of loose ends .
not my birthday again?
you're only 65 once , dad .
thank god .
now let's get the day started .
remember , dinner in the city at daddy's !
mm hmm .
it's so ridiculous .
do you love drew?
no , don't do anything .
just stay exactly where ...
do you love drew?
he's not gonna get a better offer than that .
you mean , like you loved mom?
forget about me and mom .
are you gonna marry him?
oh , come on .
i'm probably .
listen , i'm crazy about the guy .
he's smart .
he's aggressive .
he could carry parrish communications into the 21st century and me along with it .
mm hmm .
so , what's wrong with that?
that's for me .
i'm talking about you .
it's not what you say about drew .
it's what you don't say .
maybe you're not listening .
oh , yes , i am .
give him whatever he wants .
there's not an ounce of excitement , not a ... whisper of a thrill .
and this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice .
i want you to get swept away out there .
i want you to levitate .
i want you to ... sing with rapture and dance like a dervish .
oh , that's all .
yeah .
be deliriously happy , or at least leave yourself open to be .
okay .
be deliriously happy .
i shall , uh ...
i shall do my utmost .
i know it's a cornball thing .
but love is passion , obsession , someone you can't live without .
i say , fall head over heels .
find someone you can love like crazy and who will love you the same way back .
how do you find him?
well , you forget your head , and you listen to your heart .
and i'm not hearing any heart .
'cause the truth is , honey , there's no sense living your life without this .
to make the journey and not fall deeply in love , well , you haven't lived a life at all .
but you have to try , 'cause if you haven't tried , you haven't lived .
bravo !
oh , you're tough .
i'm sorry .
okay .
give it to me again , but the short version this time .
okay .
stay open .
who knows?
lightning could strike .
yeah?
yeah .
what do you think?
is it just the executive committee , or are you guys gonna use me?
quince , man , thanks for the offer , but it's all set for just me and bill .
more people might ...
i know .
i know , gum up the works .
i want you to get swept away .
huh?
i was just sayin 'to quince that we won't need him until ...
did you hear something?
yeah , but i was just sayin 'to quince ...
no , no , no .
not you .
what's the matter , daddy?
nothing .
i'm sorry .
i want you to levitate .
i want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish .
" dance like a dervish "?
daddy , what is it?
nothing , i'm just talking to myself .
you know me .
no , i've never known you to talk to yourself .
oh , well , can i give you a lift?
no , i'm gonna catch a cab .
listen , are you okay?
yeah .
got my garters on , my ears pricked ... ready for action .
okay .
well ...
go get 'em , pops .
you're damn right .
okay .
mm hmm .
mm hmm .
oh , haven't heard that one before .
i'm sorry .
i had to say it .
honey?
honey?
hi , george .
honey , you have to go on .
okay?
there's a time to sow and a time to reap .
you have to sow .
sorry .
excuse me .
no , i liked him .
i don't like him anymore .
'cause you're my honey .
someone messes with you , they mess with me .
that's it .
i'm on a plane in a heartbeat .
you let me know .
yep , when i get my phone in , you're my first call .
i promise .
hit the books , get the degree .
one day we'll be hanging out a shingle together .
how's that?
mmm?
okay .
you all right?
yes .
you bet .
be strong .
i love you .
bye bye .
morning .
good morning .
i was talkin 'kind of loud there .
i'm sorry .
oh , not at all .
it was fascinating .
yeah , what was fascinating about it?
um ...
you and , uh , " honey "?
it's my kid sister .
oh .
and she just broke up with her boyfriend and was thinking ... about dropping out of law school .
oh , i'm sorry .
no , nothing to be sorry about .
that's the way it is with men and women , isn't it?
what's the way?
nothing lasts .
oh .
yeah , i agree .
really?
why?
no , i'm interested .
i was just trying to be agreeable .
okay .
all right .
i was sharp shooting .
oh .
no , just that " nothing lasts " stuff .
that was the problem with honey's guy .
he didn't know what he wanted .
so , he's fooling around , and she catches him at it .
you know , like one girlfriend isn't enough for him .
so , you're a one girl guy .
yes , i am .
that's right .
right .
looking for her right now , actually .
mmm .
who knows?
you might be her .
no , don't laugh .
i just got into town .
i got the new job .
i'm trying to get into this apartment .
anyway , so you're a doctor .
mmm .
how'd you know?
'cause everyone's a doctor around here .
this apartment building ...
everyone's in green slippers , the green pajamas .
the guy i'm waiting for to vacate ...
doctor .
he's a doctor .
what kind of doctor?
i'm a resident ... internal medicine .
so , if i needed a doctor , you could be it .
i could be her .
yeah .
you could be ... her .
uh huh .
yeah , i could .
i'm i'm working at the hospital , so ...
i see .
this is my lucky day .
i just get in the big , bad city , not only do i find a doctor , but a beautiful woman , as well .
do you mind me saying that?
oh ...
no , of course .
no , it's fine .
it's fine .
it's just ...
listen , could i buy you a cup of coffee?
i have some patients coming in , so i should probably ...
yeah , yeah .
get goin '.
i gotta get to the apartment and get off to work .
yeah .
but i'd still like to have another cup of coffee .
um ...
would you let me do that?
well , yeah , okay .
deal .
mmm .
good morning , mr. parrish .
morning , jennifer .
so , board convenes tomorrow .
you'll recommend we close , and it's a deal , right?
as close as a deal could be .
olympic .
yes .
yes .
" yes " what?
yes is the answer to your question .
ah .
i didn't ask any question .
i believe you did .
who are you?
goddamn it .
what's going on here?
i think you know .
i don't .
try .
'cause if you haven't tried , you haven't lived .
what are you talking about?
what you were talking about .
who is this guy?
tell me who you are .
are you giving me orders?
no .
i'm sorry , i ...
no , you're not .
you're trying to handle the situation .
but this is the one situation you knew you never could handle .
it's enough ... now .
huh?
talk to me , please .
there's gonna be plenty of time for that .
what do you mean?
i think you know , bill .
it's kind of a pro bono job .
" pro bono "?
yeah .
meaning , doing good?
that's me .
gonna be doing good all your life?
i know what you're saying .
it doesn't pay so well , but , i like it .
mm hmm .
eventually it'll depend on the woman i marry , i think .
maybe she'll want lots of kids , a bigger house , better car , uh ...
college doesn't come cheap .
you know?
i don't know .
wow .
give up what you want for the woman you marry .
hmm .
yeah , you know what?
i would .
yeah?
gladly .
'cause you make your choices , you know?
say , you and i , if we were married , i would ...
no , for an example , okay?
if you and i were married , i would want to give you what you need .
that's all .
i'm talking about taking care of each other the best you can .
what's wrong with taking care of a woman?
she takes care of you .
you'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days .
shoot , you think so?
mm hmm .
i don't know .
lightning could strike .
i've gotta go .
yeah .
listen , did i say something wrong?
no?
no .
no .
no .
it was ...
sure?
it was so right , it scares me .
that's all .
just ...
you know , i was thinking , i don't want you to be my doctor .
i don't want you to ... examine me and ...
why?
because i like you so much .
and i ...
i don't want to examine you .
you don't?
why not?
because i like you so much .
oh , boy .
okay .
now i gotta go , so ...
yep , understood .
all right .
all right .
fair enough .
see ya .
bye .
bye .
bye bye .
music .
i know how you love music , daddy .
and i want to have music that pleases you , but doesn't put a thousand other people to sleep .
i've agonized over it and finally settled on sidney brown .
good .
twenty four men ... very eclectic .
mm hmm .
plus , i'm feathering in a latin sextet on their breaks .
you haven't heard a word i've said , have you?
what , honey?
sorry .
daddy .
yes .
daddy?
mr. parrish?
yes?
dinner's served .
yeah .
never mind .
leave it to me .
did you miss me , bill?
chow time , you guys .
what are you looking so provoked about?
did you miss me?
it's a normal question .
i missed you .
but what do i get back?
not an ounce of excitement .
not a whisper of a thrill .
this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice .
i'm waiting outside the front door .
did you speak to the governor?
he's coming .
and his wife?
yeah , unfortunately .
i sat between them at the bronx zoo benefit .
it was better than seconal .
i'm waiting outside the front door , bill .
won't someone let me in?
lillian?
is there somebody at the front door?
i didn't hear a ring , sir .
have a look , would you , please?
what about the mayor?
he said he's going to be there with bells on .
good .
maybe they'll drown him out .
please don't be negative , drew .
i'm sorry .
the chairman of the f. c. c. , the secretary general of the u. n. ,
wow . nine senators ,
i don't know how many congressmen and at least 12 of the fortune 500 .
any jocks?
hmm?
no .
no 20 game winner , masters champion , someone i can talk to?
you were right , mr. parrish .
there was a gentleman at the door .
he's waiting for you in the foyer .
show him into the library .
tell him i'll be right there .
yes , sir .
i've arranged favors , silver charm bracelets for the women ,
mmm .
and platinum key chains for the men , all engraved " w. p.
but now i'm thinking of scrubbing them .
they seem so ordinary .
are they ordinary?
do they seem that way to you , daddy?
i don't know .
i don't know .
i , uh ...
let me see .
i don't think they're ordinary .
i think they're great .
i love key chains .
hello?
anyone here?
i said , is anyone here?
quiet down .
where are you?
i'm here .
what is this , a joke , right?
some kind of elaborate practical joke?
at my 40th reunion , we delivered a casket ... to the class president's hotel room and , uh ...
quiet .
where are you going , bill?
i , uh ...
the great bill parrish at a loss for words?
the man from whose lips fall " rapture " and " passion " and " obsession "?
all those admonitions about being " deliriously happy , that there is no sense living your life without .
all the sparks and energy you give off , the rosy advice you dispense in round , pear shaped tones .
what the hell is this?
who are you?
just think of millenniums multiplied by eons ... compounded by time without end .
i've been around that long .
but it's only recently that your affairs here have piqued my interest .
call it boredom .
the natural curiosity of me , the most lasting ... and significant element in existence , has come to see you .
about what?
i want to have a look around before i take you .
take me where?
it requires competence , wisdom and experience .
all those things they say about you in testimonials .
and you're the one .
the one to do what?
show me around , be my guide .
and in return , you get ...
i get what?
minutes , days , weeks .
let's not get encumbered by detail .
what matters is that i stay interested .
yes .
yes " what?
yes is the answer to your question .
what question?
oh , bill .
come on .
the question .
the question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity , at odd moments , panting through the extra game of handball , when you ran for the plane in delhi , when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning .
the question that is in the back of your throat , choking the blood to your brain , ringing in your ears over and over as you put it to yourself .
" the question .
yes , bill .
the question .
the question .
am i going to die?
yes .
am i dreaming this?
are you a dream?
i'm not a dream .
you're coming to take me?
what is that?
and who the hell are you?
you are ...
yes?
who am i?
death .
you're death?
yes .
death .
that's me .
you're not death .
you're just a kid in a suit .
the suit came with the body i took .
let me ask your opinion .
do i blend in?
you want me to be your guide?
you fill the bill , bill .
i do?
mmm .
will you be staying long?
we should hope quite a while .
and then?
it's over .
it's over .
mr. parrish?
will the gentleman be staying for dinner , sir?
yes .
thank you .
this is crazy .
you're not gonna eat dinner with us .
no , i am eating dinner with you ... and your family .
and that is what we're doing .
it's not open for discussion , nothing is .
don't you understand?
yeah .
good .
now lead the way .
bill ,
lead the way .
excuse me , may i say something?
yes , of course .
well , it just occurred to me , if , uh ...
speak up , please .
when i introduce you , if i say who you are ,
i don't think anyone will stay for dinner .
then don't .
here's another possibility .
it's a little last minute , but tell me what you think .
kaleidoscopes .
little gold kaleidoscopes .
some german company went kerplunk , and tiffany's picked all these things up , and they're perfect party favors .
okay , they're not personalized or anything .
they're just winter scenes ... dachshunds , snowflakes .
hi there .
hello .
sorry to have ... stepped away for so long .
this is a friend of mine i asked to drop by .
we got to talking and stuff , and , uh ...
he's gonna join us for dinner .
great .
how nice to meet you .
and wouldn't it be nicer if my father would introduce you?
how nice to meet you .
yeah , i'm sorry .
this is my daughter , allison , and her husband , quince , and drew , my number one , works with me .
daddy , does your friend have a name?
a name?
something he goes by?
oh , yeah , excuse me .
this is , uh ...
this is , um ...
daddy , come on .
a name .
bill , the suspense is killing me .
i'm sorry .
it's , uh ...
it's gone right out of my head .
um ...
i'm sorry .
this is ...
joe .
joe .
i love that name .
just plain joe .
me too .
hey , buddy .
is there any more to it?
what do you mean?
like " smith " or " jones " or ...
black .
oh , at last .
nice to meet you , mr. black .
hey , hey , joe black .
won 15 , lost 2 for the brooklyn dodgers , 1952 .
i'm king of my rotisserie league .
are you?
yeah , he is .
shall we sit down?
right there .
have we met?
he's from out of town .
how long you here for , joe?
as long as it takes .
you and bill , you old friends?
no .
no , thank you .
i have one , thank you .
i get the feeling you've done some business before .
i got it .
have you done some business before?
we have an arrangement now .
what side of the industry did you say you were on?
i didn't say .
joe sounds like a ringer , bill .
i have a feeling you guys got the broad strokes already .
you need any help with the details?
i'm sorry , business at dinner .
forgive me for being so rude .
certainly .
hi , everybody .
i'm sorry i'm late .
i had to have dinner with my department chief .
you ate?
i'm here , aren't i?
i wouldn't miss a loose ends meeting .
what's on the table for discussion?
party favors , flowers ...
hi , dad .
hi .
hello .
hi , drew .
what are you doing here?
you know each other?
we've met .
this morning , the corinth coffee shop .
he was , uh ...
he was looking for a doctor .
well , i guess he's found one .
joe , you do get around .
that's your name?
and isn't it a lovely one?
so sturdy , so straight .
stop it .
incidentally , joe , where are you staying?
here .
you're staying here?
in this house?
yes , in this house .
great .
great .
great .
will that hold you , joe?
incidentally , joe what?
black .
this is fun .
yes .
yes , quince , it is .
so , what are you doing here , joe?
cat got your tongue?
you weren't so silent this morning .
this morning , yes .
i wasn't quite myself .
well , it's a shame whoever you were couldn't be here tonight .
cut it out , susan .
we've gotta talk .
cut it out , susan .
we've gotta talk .
busy day tomorrow , everybody .
joe , let's go .
yes .
that stuff between you and susan threw me .
threw you?
where?
shook me up .
i mean , how is it that you happened to meet my daughter?
i didn't meet her .
the young man i took met her .
that is , the fellow she encountered in the coffee shop this morning .
what happened to him?
i needed a body , bill .
so ,
come in .
uh , bathroom , tub , towels , sauna , chairs , lamps , bed .
well , if there is anything else , don't hesitate .
i won't .
i can try .
will she be available next week?
i don't know .
yes , sir?
hello .
i'm joe black .
it's nice meeting you .
yes , of course , mr. black , sir .
a pleasure .
eh ...
what is that?
you mean this , sir?
yes .
it's , uh , laura scudder's peanut butter , sir .
you like it?
well , i would say , in my opinion , it's right up there with jif and skippy .
could i offer you a taste , sir?
yes .
all right .
do you fancy it , sir?
more?
right .
mmm .
mmm .
you're a peanut butter man now , eh , sir?
yes , i believe i am .
i thoroughly enjoy this peanut butter .
and i thoroughly enjoyed meeting you all .
i'll be moseying on .
right , sir .
what are you doing here?
i'm lost .
i can't seem to escape you today .
i'm sorry .
yeah .
would you hand me one of those?
you must have something very ... big going on with my father .
big?
yeah .
you appear at his side out of the blue , stay at his house , have dinner with his family .
that's , uh , practically a first .
you're in the red hot center of big business , and i thought you were just a regular joe .
i am joe .
not the one that i met this morning .
hitting on me in as nice a way as i've been hit on in a long time .
the second that you found out i was my father's daughter , you , uh ...
well , you acted like a stranger .
that is not my intention .
what are your intentions?
huh?
i mean , just to , uh , make little dramas in coffee shops , turn a woman's head?
i don't mind admitting that my my head was turned .
i i liked it .
but , well , ten hours later , i feel like a fool .
i just don't get it .
i don't .
you , my father , here in this house .
it's , uh ...
it's upsetting me , and i ...
what happened to that sweet guy from the coffee shop?
who are you , anyway?
and ... what are you eating?
peanut butter .
hmm .
but it's gone now .
wh ...
no .
please .
you act like you've never had peanut butter before .
i haven't .
what kind of childhood did you have?
do you love drew?
excuse me?
when you put your mouth to his , it seemed a frequent thing .
drew is none of your business , and neither is where i put my mouth .
i'm sorry .
do you live here?
no , joe , i'm swimming here and now i'm going home .
yes , i think what i'm trying to say is ,
i would like it if we were friends .
i've got plenty of friends .
i don't have any .
well , i can see why .
i didn't mean to offend you at dinner .
i'm sometimes ... not quite at home around people .
and i don't seem to have developed ...
yes?
i have a certain function to perform , and it seems to take up most of my time .
but sometimes i ... speculate ... that i haven't left room for ... anything else .
hmm .
i'm sorry to say i know what you mean .
well , um ...
good night , joe .
yes .
good night to you , susan .
morning , madeline .
oh , good morning , mr. parrish .
everything okay?
yes , sir .
good .
morning .
good morning , bill .
what's on the docket for today?
docket?
hmm , yes .
what shall we do?
well , i have to go to work , and ...
splendid .
i'll join you .
oh .
would you like to ride or walk?
walk .
i wish to see the world .
this is crazy .
this is the left field thing of all time .
i , uh ...
i don't know if i can get through this .
what do i do?
what do i tell my family?
you'll get through this , bill .
as far as your family's concerned , uh , i wouldn't say anything .
you'll ruin the great start we had last night .
hmm .
it felt as if i was being treated like a person .
yes , joe this , joe that .
a nice smile .
quince passed me the rolls .
no passion or rapture or any of these mighty things you're so intent on imparting .
but i am certain , should you say who i am , our adventure would end abruptly .
mm hmm .
and i did so enjoy your family .
what about my family?
this adventure involves only me , right?
what do you mean?
i'll tell you what .
you promise this undertaking of yours ... involves only me and , uh ...
and what?
i won't tell anyone who you are .
sounds fair enough .
good .
is it a deal?
a deal?
yeah .
you give your word ; i give mine that we'll do what we say .
mm hmm .
it is a truth exchanged between two people .
bill?
what?
you have a deal .
ow !
that's great .
great .
you know , i got to thinking .
with you here and seemingly occupied , how's your work going , i mean , elsewhere?
while you were shaving this morning , you weren't just shaving .
what do you mean?
you were hatching ideas , making plans , arriving at decisions , right?
yeah , i guess so .
so you understand the concept .
while part of you is busy doing one thing , another part of you is doing another , perhaps even attending to the problems of your work .
correct?
of course .
so you understand the idea .
congratulations , bill .
now multiply that by infinity , take that to the depths of forever , and you still will barely have a glimpse of what i'm talking about .
joe?
yes , bill?
how about giving a guy a break?
make an exception?
well , there's one to every rule .
not this .
and call my family .
i'd like them to have dinner with me tonight .
didn't the family get together last night?
jennifer .
of course , mr. parrish , right away .
uh , perhaps you'd like to wait in my office .
no .
what i'm trying to say is this is a board meeting and you're not a member .
i'm sure you'll find a way to make it all right .
nice to meet you .
morning .
good morning .
thank you .
eddie .
uh , this is joe black .
he's a personal associate of mine , and , uh ...
hello , quince .
hey .
he'll be joining us this morning .
i know this is unusual , and my apologies , and , uh ...
drew , carry on .
it's nice to see you .
didn't expect you , but , uh ... certainly you can't get enough of a good thing .
thank you .
joe , would you like to sit there?
okay .
uh , the board of parrish communications is hereby called to order .
our sole order of ...
our s ...
our sole order of business today is a , uh ... is an acceptance of john bontecou's generous offer .
and i think bill ...
do you have any more of these delicious cookies?
the jelly ones?
mmm , and a cup of tea .
with milk , i think .
i'd like to try it english style .
yes .
a cup of tea with milk , please .
is there anything else , mr. black?
how about some water?
why , yes , thank you .
hot or cold?
cold .
and a glass?
mmm .
uh , to review .
we're really crossing the t's and dotting the i's here .
uh , bill had a great and conclusive meeting yesterday with john bontecou , and all that remains for us is to put it to a vote .
um , thank you .
drew , um ...
yeah .
i did enjoy , or rather i was interested ... in meeting john bontecou yesterday , and , um ...
impressive , i suppose .
but , uh ...
but ...
it did get me to thinking .
see , i started in this business because this is what i wanted to do .
i knew i wasn't gonna write the great american novel .
but i also knew there was more to life than buying something for a dollar ... and selling it for two .
i'd hoped to create something , something which could be ...
and what i realized was i ...
i wanted to give the news to the world .
and i wanted to give it unvarnished .
the more we all know about each other , the greater the chance we will survive .
sure , i want to make a profit .
you can't exist without one , but , uh ...
john bontecou is all profit .
if we give him license to absorb parrish communications ... and he has his eye on a few others after us ... in order to reach the world , you will have to go through john bontecou .
and not only will you have to pay him to do this , far more important , you'll have to agree with him .
reporting the news is a privilege and a responsibility .
and it is not exploitable .
parrish communications has earned this privilege .
john bontecou wants to buy it .
as your chairman ,
i urge you to agree .
this company is not for sale .
it sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion .
thank you .
you're welcome .
i know .
i'm sorry , i ...
looks like i'm reversing my field .
that's your privilege , bill .
but given our needs , given the absolute necessity for growth , given the future , the truth is , joining john bontecou is every bit as certain as death and taxes .
death and taxes?
yes .
death and taxes?
yes .
what an odd pairing .
it's just a saying , mr. black .
mmm .
by whom?
doesn't matter .
then why'd you bring it up?
you're not familiar with the phrase , " in this world , nothing is certain but death and taxes "?
well , i am now .
glad i could be of some help .
i keep regular office hours if there's any further information you might need ... on sayings , common phrases , manners of speaking .
my door's wide open .
the tea i can provide , perhaps even the milk .
low fat .
yeah , okay , well , uh ...
i think we've accomplished everything we're going to this morning .
shall we adjourn?
but the matter is still on the table , bill .
joe?
yes .
thank you for the delicious cookies .
mmm .
who is that guy?
so ... what's the deal here?
you gonna be breathing down my neck right till the very end?
i don't understand .
i'd like to be alone for a while .
are you sad , bill?
yes , i am .
why don't you take a walk or something , get some air?
i know i'll be seeing you .
of course .
good .
now i'd like to be alone .
this will hold you for a while .
you know about money , don't you?
it can't buy happiness?
yeah .
uh , jennifer?
give mr. black a map of the city , would you?
it's okay , bill .
i can manage .
hi .
hi .
i need a medical record number for labs .
uh huh .
and , uh , will you try calling her husband?
the number's on top .
also , can you page me when c. t. 's ready?
oh , sure .
thanks , sweetie .
how nice you look .
is that your uniform?
what are you doing here?
are you ill?
oh , goodness , no .
then why are you here , joe?
i'm here to see you .
joe , i don't ...
i don't have time to see you right now .
i'm , um , about to start making rounds , and i'm examining back to back patients until dinner , and , uh ...
very well .
i'll watch .
watch me do what?
make rounds and examine back to back patients .
joe , that's impossible .
i'm a doctor .
and i'll be a visitor .
patients have visitors , not doctors .
i don't mind .
miss?
miss?
doctor .
oh , um , just one second .
i'll be right there .
please .
my mama is sicker than him .
okay .
obeah .
no , mama .
obeah , man .

i'll be right there .
come now , mama .
she's in a great deal of pain .
yes .
have you spent much time in the islands?
some .
i realize now my being here , uh , is not quite appropriate .
oh , no , please ...
please don't apologize .
yes?
yeah .
i'm glad that you came .
thank you , susan .
i'm very happy to be here .
joe , i'm with drew .
not now .
i have to go .
i'm sorry to say .
be sorry for nothing .
right .
thanks , joe .
good bye , susan .
good?
mmm .
yes , what is it?
cold lamb sandwich with cilantro .
a little coleman's mustard .
it's , uh , splendid .
glad you like it .
my wife turned me on to cold lamb sandwiches .
joan ... was my wife .
mm hmm .
yeah .
cold lamb sandwiches .
not as chewy as roast beef , not as boring as chicken .
she knew stuff like that .
everything reminds me of her .
there isn't a day goes by that i don't think about her .
one day she didn't feel well .
the next day she was gone .
so what are you gonna do?
yeah .
i guess you've heard all this a trillion times before , huh?
more .
why didn't you stop me?
i don't know .
what was it like when you first met?
i thought you'd heard it a trillion times before .
this part i'm interested in .
well , she had on this little blue suit ...
with a little white collar that had a little ... red piping on it .
yeah?
hi .
am i interrupting?
yes .
no .
just kidding?
sit down , drew .
uh , before i do , i was hoping we might be alone , bill .
well , joe and i have no secrets from each other .
how nice for you both .
pardon my candor , but i was confounded by your decision this morning .
why?
i was hired .
you told me to help bring parrish communications into the 21st century .
this merger is the vehicle .
in my estimation ...
perhaps a merger is a way ... to bring bill's company into the 21st century , and perhaps it isn't .
and perhaps cheating on your french philosophers exam at the groton school ... was an expedient way to get your diploma , and perhaps it wasn't .
be that as it may , drew , a question can often be argued both ways .
joe , cut it out .
you too , drew .
i thought this was practically a done deal .
well , now it's undone , okay?
forget bontecou .
scrub him .
i'm tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer .
i'm not going for it .
okay .
bill , why at this juncture ... are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
'cause i don't want anybody buying up my life's work !
turning it into something it wasn't meant to be .
a man wants to leave something behind .
he wants it left behind the way he made it .
he wants it to be run the way he ran it , with a sense of honor , of dedication , of truth .
easy , bill .
you'll give yourself a heart attack ... and ruin my vacation .
now listen .
i read you all the way on the bontecou thing , and i know where you're coming from , and i am with you 101 percent .
well , thank you , quince .
but i just gotta tell you , if mergers are in the wind ,
i've developed some great prospects .
and i want to come and talk to you about ... about 'em next week .
next week?
yeah .
or the week after .
no good?
no .
why , anything's possible .
it's up to joe .
joe .
you just don't know how glad i am you're aboard , because anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man ,
i am ...
i'm in his corner .
that's very gracious of you , quince .
ah , it's no problem .
well , i'll leave you two alone , because i can , uh ...
i can tell , you know ... you got something in the fire .
now , look , i know you're down .
but you know , when you're down , there's no place to go but up .
up .
thanks , quince .
forget about bontecou .
i got a couple other merger possibilities up my sleeve , and i'm pitching 'em to the old man .
were you?
yeah .
hey , listen .
mm hmm .
we're gonna go in together .
i'll clue you in .
the timing has gotta be right , because the old man says it's up to joe .
he said it's up to joe?
mm hmm .
those were his words?
yeah .
it's up to joe , huh?
yeah .
that's what he said?
that's what he ...
that's what he said .
that's very interesting .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
i thought so too .
i want to thank you all for coming .
uh , my family , um , allison and quince ,
susan and the other members .
and , uh ...
so glad when we can get together .
i mean , i know you all have busy lives .
look who's talking .
yeah .
speak for yourself .
yeah .
i remember when you were little girls , and , uh ...
i love little girls .
and uh , now you're all grown up , and i , um ...
i had some words prepared , but , uh ,
i've forgotten them .
um ...
wait a minute , uh ...
there's so much i wanted to say , uh ...
daddy?
you could sit down if you want to .
yeah .
so many words i wanted to ...
so much i wanted to say , but , uh ...
i can't , and so , uh ...
yeah , i better sit down .
carry on , everybody , please .
oh , one other thing .
um , why don't we all ... have dinner again tomorrow night , okay?
dinner again?
yeah .
you haven't had enough of us yet , dad?
mmm ... mmm ... no .
come here .
we'll be here .
you bet we'll be here .
bright eyed and bushy tailed .
joe .
oh , no .
i would prefer some peanut butter .
how would you like that , sir?
on some kind of toast?
toast .
no , just the butter .
right away , sir .
why do you like peanut butter so much?
i don't know .
hmm .
i adore things like that .
food i can't do without .
don't you?
yes .
it comforts you , doesn't it?
yes , i find that it does .
mind if i throw up?
drew .
please .
i'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today .
i am too .
has her pain abated?
we're doing what we can for her , but , uh , it's not looking very good .
i'm sorry to hear that .
yeah .
who are we talking about?
but i know she's grateful for the care you're giving her .
is this a state secret?
no , we're talking about a patient of mine , 'cause ...
uh huh .
joe stopped by the hospital today .
he did?
that's more than we get to do .
maybe next time you go to the hospital , you'll take us along with you .
perhaps you could remind me .
well , i'll make a note of it .
anything else i can do for you?
i wanna come along too .
see susie strut her stuff .
you're on , quincie .
destination , hospital .
joe , you can be the tour guide , okay?
susan's a wonderful doctor .
i'm sure she is .
bill?
yeah?
i have to go .
it's been a hell of a day .
i need a few minutes to sort everything out .
see you tomorrow .
joe?
yes , bill?
um ...
why'd you go to the hospital?
i don't know .
you just curious?
i guess .
about susan?
i wouldn't put it that way .
how would you put it?
you tell me , bill .
no , how about you telling me?
i ask a simple question ; i expect a straight answer .
that's what i'm used to .
anybody who doesn't give it to me , i fire .
are you going to fire me , bill?
drew?
so , uh , i'll see you tomorrow night?
you include me out .
i've had enough of the convocations .
you don't mean that .
you don't want to disappoint dad .
daddy will do fine .
besides , he's got joe .
and it seems you do too .
you're out of line .
well , that may be , but i don't like the ubiquitous creep .
i don't like the way he looks at you .
i don't like the way he talks to you .
and vice versa .
i'm sorry .
'cause i like the way he looks and talks to me .
and vice versa .
okay?
not okay .
thought we had a good thing going here .
i thought it was a good thing .
well , that just goes to show you never know .
night .
good night .
how long have you been standing there?
i don't like the way he spoke to you .
but i feel better now because of the way you spoke back .
tell me about yourself , joe .
i mean , who are you?
what are you doing here with my father?
you're not going to tell me?
you're married , aren't you?
why?
because men who never say anything about themselves , they're ... they're always married .
so you're married?
no , i'm not .
but you ... you have a girlfriend .
no .
gay?
no .
so , tell me , joe ...
how come a man as attractive , intelligent , well spoken ...
diffident in the most seductive way , and yet ... powerful ... is all alone in this world?
i'm sorry .
i'm s ...
i didn't ... mean to pry , and , uh , you obviously don't want to tell me , so we'll just ...
we'll just leave it a mystery .
that is the way you want it , isn't it?
yes , thank you .
where are you going?
to bed .
to bed?
yes .
i'm tired .
good night , daddy .
good night .
sleep well .
okay .
see you tomorrow .
good night .
see you .
good night , susie .
get some sleep .
good night .
yeah .
see you tomorrow .
good night .
good night .
that was wonderful .
mmm .
it's good to get together .
mm hmm .
do you mind if i raise a little caution flag?
raise away .
what is the nature of your interest in joe?
well ...
remember how you told me about lightning striking?
mm hmm .
the nature of it's in there somewhere .
yeah .
well , i won't say you're on the wrong track , but , uh ...
then what will you say?
i don't think this is the lightning you're looking for .
i mean , drew is a good man .
i know i didn't seem to be completely in his corner before , but , uh , i've come to appreciate that , um ...
now we love drew?
and joe doesn't measure up?
what's going on?
nothing .
when you say " nothing " that way , it is not nothing .
then what is it?
it's something .
okay .
good night .
i'll see you tomorrow .
yeah .
good night .
i know you're all as uncomfortable as i am to be meeting like this .
but i got a call last night from john bontecou .
not only is he still interested , he's sweetening his offer .
although it pains me to say it , in my opinion ,
bill parrish dealt with us preemptively ... in dismissing any deal with bontecou .
therefore , i'm sorry to say that if we're to examine this new offer responsibly , as the board of directors of parrish communications , we must do so without its chairman .
there's one additional element .
bontecou is so anxious to get us , he said he'd take parrish communications with bill parrish or without .
in this crisis , and be assured ... this is a crisis , it's not pleasant to say the following .
but i would be remiss if i did not .
when we present bill with the improved bontecou offer , and if he still refuses to let us consider it , once more makes an adamant or emotional rejection , we will have no choice but to ...
you're taking this too far , drew .
am i not obligated to?
see if quince is here .
how did all this come about?
crisis , bill parrish .
crisis , his company .
crisis for us .
it came about with the arrival on the scene of mr. joe black .
mr. joe who?
joe black .
he attends our board meetings .
he sleeps at bill's house .
he resides in his office .
he never leaves his side , and , in my opinion , is always in his ear , telling bill what to do .
and bill is listening .
who is joe black?
what ...
what is his relationship to bill parrish , and most important , what is behind his influence on our chairman?
he's had advisors before .
nobody tells bill what to do .
thanks for coming , quince .
sure .
hi , ed .
hi , folks .
i didn't know everybody was going to be here .
nice surprise .
what's with the new digs?
drew's idea of cloak and dagger .
this is a secret meeting , quince .
i hope you'll respect its nature .
have a seat , quince .
now , what we're trying to do here is to , uh ... to gather our thoughts in light of bill's rejection of bontecou's offer ... and to make an appropriate presentation to him ... as to how we think the company might proceed .
won't you share with our board the information you gave me last night?
well , uh , i'm hap ...
i'm happy to tell you i got good news .
as i was , uh , as i was telling drew , uh , i've been making a little hay while the bontecou sun was shining .
two , possibly three , new and boiling hot prospects for merger .
mm hmm .
and how did bill react to the leads you've developed?
he was interested .
yeah , but he was concerned about the timing?
timing?
yeah , he was concerned about the timing?
yes .
he says it's up to joe .
it's up to joe .
