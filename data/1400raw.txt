my son , our family owes a lot to the cyclo taxi
we work hard , day and night
eating and sleeping in the street .
pedalling all the time
some mornings , the backaches nail you to the bed
i don't know where it all leads
this has been my life
when i die , i'll have nothing to leave you
if you can , see if you can find something more worthy
you're late !
look again and see if i'm right
the people's committee makes loans
in line with the policy
of fighting poverty
where is it?

eighteen
parents 'occupation?

how did he die?
a truck ... he died instantly , with two passengers
at hang xanh intersection , right?

go with him
he was born that way , he must be your age
take care of your tooth
you see , i told you
okay , that's enough , get out
come on grandpa , it's late
yes , let's go home
bring tobacco for grandfather
ls your shoulder better?
it gets worse everyday
do you have any balm left?
hardly any
i'll bring some back for you
grandfather , take the scale they sent us by mistake and change jobs , it'll be easier
see how it's done
someone comes , you wipe
you invite him to try , 1000 dongs per person
we shouldn't .
the scale isn't ours
yes we can , we've waited long enough
no one has claimed it
your shoulder's hurting
you can't keep pumping tires
let's wait a while
on the old riverbanks leaves and flowers fade
the sun dies , icy , shuddering
hesitant , i cross the hamlet
my childhood , i remember you
i remember your graceful silhouette
you gazed at me , radiant , tender
i remember the sun was setting
on your ivory cheeks your rippling hair
put him to bed
tomorrow , i'll come see if you're dead or not
get up , little brother
go wash up
ifl , the heron , die by boiling
may it be in clear water
to ease my children's suffering
follow them
and not a word to anyone
bom has a fan made of palm leaves
the rich man says , i'll trade you
three cows and nine buffalo
i don't want your buffalo
i'll give you a pond full of fish
i don't want your fish
i'll give you a raft of precious wood
i don't want your wood
i'll give you a bird ...
tomorrow , come to the icehouse
i'll tell you what to do
go now and be discreet
what's the matter?
who is it?
why?
he stole my cyclo
don't be stupid , he works for the boss lady
let's go !
wait here
don't go out
except to eat
and don't lock the door
close your mouth , it stinks
do you have any money?
no
we stayed up all night again
let's go to sleep
can i sleep here?
another time
i don't want to do it
i came because you wanted me to
i called , no one answered
can i come in?
don't touch her
it's her first time
would you like to pee?
you want to piss?
peepee , you get it?

drink and pee
pee , please !
drink again !
again , drink up !
that's enough !

and do it standing up !
i brought you two friends
people are singing your praises
you're a samaritan
you tried to save a drowning man?
the boss is happy
she sent you this reward
damn , you're disgusting
she wants to see you , for another job
what?
what did you say?
i don't dare
i didn't ask your opinion !
you dare refuse?
what does he want?

this is a taste
next time it'll be straight
sabotage !
250 tons of mouldy rice
do you know who did it?
imagine yourself in the headlines?
that's a life sentence !
nameless river
i was born sobbing
blue sky , vast earth
black stream water
i grow with the months , the years
with no one to watch over me
nameless is man
nameless is the river
colorless the flower
perfume
without a voice
o , river i o , passer by i
in the closed cycle
of the months , the years
i can't forget my debt to my roots
and i wander
through worlds
towards my land ...
his father won't let me work
i'm bored
i'm going round in circles
so i busy myself with small tasks
is papa well?
he just came home
when he leaves , i feel so alone
you're thin
when he was little , his nose bled
does it still happen?
yes .
sometimes
i'll show you a photo
what are you looking for?
he's still here?
he's our son
please , speak to him
he came with his whore?
please
what are you looking for?
he was five years old
stay and eat with us
mama ...
no , he won't let me
we were starving ...
no rice ...
people dying everywhere ...
we loved each other deeply
at 16 , or 17
we drank alcohol
to forget our hunger
a bit of shrimp paste ... on the end of a nail ... and we drank ...
it lasted a year ...
then the child was born
he came out backwards
too late ... almost dead
the doctor said " abnormal
coward .
he was a coward
the father left us
why coward?
he was only 17
younger than his son is now
and then ...
how much for a bottle of gasoline?
5, 000

and all alone !
you're a real pro !
no cop can catch me
i know all the shortcuts

you like skirts?
women's underwear?
that's all there was
you sure you're a guy?

that's my gift .

what did you just say?
i got a shock , too
which gang were you talking about?
i want to be like you
take him to mr. lullaby !
look at my hands?
see?
ln 1956
i was 17 a bullet cut the nerve my hand stiffened up
and look at this ...
a bullet , through the neck
it came out the back
guess which hole is bigger?
and then this here in 57 , a bullet shattered my shin
you know why i'm telling you all this?
i know what you're thinking faced with death
i understand you so well
autumn wind blows
sleep my child , sleep
the night is long
i'll watch over you
until the night is over i'll watch over you
listen carefully to the art of syncopation
sleep , my child , my beloved
my little one

ah , for an iced tea !
waiter !
an iced tea !
