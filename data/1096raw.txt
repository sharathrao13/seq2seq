miss carmichael , won't you come in?

where are we?
oh , my god .
o oh , my god .

because if you're not sure , we could just go back to the car .
mel , mel , mel , mel ...
it's only been 8 months .
you know i never do anything rash .

i don't already know the answer to , so ... at the risk of being rejected twice ,
i'm gonna ask you again .
will you marry me?
yes !

yes !
pick one .
mayor , just one shot !
one shot !
can you comment on the watson bill?

no doubt thanks to that carbuncle girl .
carmichael ... designer , southern .
right , whatever .
right here , mayor !
please , mayor !
miss mayor , over here !
your honor , how do you answer those who are opposed to the street improvement project you put before the city council today?
i suggest they take a drive on some of the streets in brooklyn .
maybe they'll disappear into a pothole .
your son's relationship with melanie carmichael ... sources say they're engaged .
do you have a comment?
trust me , if my son were engaged , i'd have a comment .
i thought you were tired .
jimmy , can you excuse us for a second?
i've been planning this for weeks .
i knew your show would be great , and tonight is perfect .
oh , god , i can't wait to see the look on my mother's face .
come on , let's call your parents .
no !
i i mean ...
n not right this second .
what i mean is , uh ...
honey , would you mind terribly if we just kept this to ourselves for a few days?
mel , it's gonna come out sooner or later .
no , i i know , i know , but , um , it's just , i haven't seen my folks in about 7 years , and i just feel like i should probably tell them in person .
of course .
and , um ... l i think i should do it alone .
mel , i'm gonna have to meet them eventually .
i i know , i know , and they will love you ... eventually .
is it because i'm a yankee?
well , that ... and a democrat .
okay ... mum's the word .
no one will know .
thank you .
secretary hennings , will you comment ...
secretary hennings ...
okay .
hello .
why haven't you told your mother you're engaged?
have you thought about children?
i'm sorry we're late .
that shade of lipstick does nothing for you .
what kept you?
oh , it's none of your business .
ah , you know i hate surprises .
what's going on?
oh , tom , always a pleasure .
good to see you .
melanie , darling .
hi , your honor .
so good to see you .
look at you ... always the belle of the ball .
i hear very good things about your new line .
oh , yeah .
thanks .
always a pleasure .
um ...
andrew?
yes?
seems melanie is wearing a skating rink on a very important finger .
um , your honor , i'd really like to keep it ...
oh , my god , you're engaged? !
quiet .
bloody hell , mel , i'm your first new york friend , and i have to read about it with 12 million other people !
sorry , honey , she just grabbed my hand .
what was i supposed to do?
i know ... we read all about it .
so , did you cry?
wouldn't you?
one man for the rest of my life?
i'd bawl my bloody eyes out .
so why don't you meet us?
we're just around the corner .
can't .
i'm in alabama .
oh ... my god .
yeah .
aw , he's loud , but he don't bite .
come on , shut up , hound !
lie down .
go on , stay .
now , how can i help you?
well , for starters , you can get your stubborn ass down here and give me a divorce .
come on , jake , i mean it .
the joke's over .
let's just finish this .
i've got a plane to catch .
you're shittin 'me , right?
you know , i've never actually understood that expression , but , no , i'm not " shitting " you .
look , it's even got these idiot proof tabs to make it easy .
there's one copy for me , one copy for you , and one copy for the lawyers .
what?
speak !
you show up here after 7 years without so much as a " hey , there , jake , remember me ... your wife?
or a " hi , honey .
lookin 'good .
how's the family?
you expect me to tell you you look good?
did they run out of soap down at the piggly wiggly since i left?
they laugh at that up north or wherever it is you been?
you knew where i was .
and don't even pretend you spent all this time missing me .
oh , i missed you , all right .
but at this range , my aim is bound to improve .
is that a threat?
i've got a lawyer who charges $350 an hour .
he billed me every time you sent these papers back .
well , i'm glad to see you finally got the message .
shut up , bear !
shut up , bryant !
what happened to bear?
he died .
you weren't here .
what are you doing? !
leavin '.
you done it .
you should recognize the gesture .
could we just try to keep this as civilized as possible?
please sign these papers so i can go home .
what do you know from home?
hell , i bet your folks don't even know you're in town .
that's my business .
honey , those people are the only family you got .
don't you " honey " me , honey !
get your butt back in that car , you drive over and see 'em , and then maybe we'll talk .
jake !
you dumb , stubborn , redneck hick !
the only reason you won't sign these papers is 'cause i want you to !
wrong !
the only reason i ain't signin 'is 'cause you've turned into some hoity toity yankee bitch , and i'd like nothin 'better right now than to piss you off !
unh !
what are you doin 'with mose plydell's plane anyhow? !
that's my business !
fine !
fine !
divorce , my ass .
hey , genius ...
next time you lock somebody out , make sure they don't know where the spare key's hidden .
well , see , that's the thing about hide a keys ... it'd be nice if your wife told you where it was !
i'm not your wife , jake .
i'm just the first girl that climbed in the back of your truck .
but you're right ...
i have changed .
i don't even know that girl anymore .
well , then ... allow me to remind you .
born into one of the wealthiest families of greenville , alabama , her daddy's in cotton and all that that implies .
there's no listing for an earl carmichael in greenville .
how about her local high school?
no record of a melanie carmichael attending ... ever .
jesus !
whatever happened to responsible journalism?
there's something wrong here .
why would my son do this to me?
maybe he , um , loves her .
oh , please !
this is classic rebound .
he's still wounded from ... who was his last girlfriend?
whitney truesdale , lawyer , san francisco .
yeah , well , there was a match made in heaven ... society , political family , california ... all those electoral votes .
get andrew on the phone .
since we have a small window for the secretary of housing , please hold your questions until after the presentation .
gentlemen .
did you see the look on my mom's face?
i thought her head was going to explode .
yeah , what did she say?
that i should date women like melanie , not marry them .
that's harsh .
that's mom .
thank you .
thanks a lot .
we hope to have the bronx children's hospital
open by fall 2003 .
oh , speak of the devil .
hello?
so , have you two lovebirds set a date?
i'm pleading the fifth .
okay , fine , just try to keep your secrets .
i dare you .
oh , at least you sound like you're in a better mood .
my approval rating went up 2 points .
it seems the public likes being reminded i am a mother .
god , always running for office .
i'm only thinking of you .
say , um ... do you happen to have the carmichaels 'number down there in greenville?
i thought perhaps i should introduce myself .
i would like to meet them first , if you don't mind .
you do realize the press is going to be all over this .
happy couples don't sell .
so if there are any skeletons in her closet , andrew , we need to know about them .
you make clothes , right?
i design them .
there's a big difference .
did you design anything with stripes?
you called the sheriff? !
you know that old bastard hates me !
for good reason !
well , hell's bells , if it ain't felony melanie .
wade !
hot damn , girl , do we miss you around here !
hey , i think i saw poor , old fuzz just the other day .
oh , god , you had to bring that up .
i can't believe you're the sheriff !
yep , i get to frisk pretty little things like you all day and get paid for it .
wade , can you try and be a little more professional?
we got us a crime suspect here .
now , melanie , you can't just go breaking into people's houses .
i didn't break in , wade .
i used a key ... my key .
well , it still ain't your house , darlin '.
i'm gonna have to escort you out .
use the cuffs , wade , please?
if you get him to sign these , i'll let you run me out of town .
now , that's none of your concern .
well , what do we got here?
a bill of divorcement?
mm hmm .
hell , boy , i thought you said you took care of this .
and i thought i had .
obviously not .
well , if you two are still married , it's her house , too .
this here ain't nothin 'but a domestic dispute .
he didn't hit you , did he?
if he took a swing at you , i'll take him in right now .
we take that stuff pretty serious nowadays .
no , wade , jake's never hit me .
you know what?
i don't have a single childhood memory that doesn't have you two in it .
and that includes the night i lit my ass on fire .
remember?
wade ...
memory lane is closed .
ah , boy , you two got a whole lot of catchin 'up to do ... so i'm just gonna leave you to it .
man , i set you up with your wife .
you owe me one !
why won't you just sign the papers? !
hey , there is nothin 'i can do .
the law is the law , and she has done nothin 'wrong .
i suppose shoplifting steaks at winn dixie's okay .
oh !
oh !
oh !
oh !
oh !
i took 'em back , and you know it !
you remember that vandalism out at the stockyard?
totally her !
like i could tip a cow by myself .
hmm .
wade ... isn't there some outstanding warrant for whoever dumped your mama's tractor in the fishpond?
we only have 10 of these , and it's gonna be gone for good .
so if you are loving this monster ...
we have eight only?
if i knew how to say that in italian , i would , but i don't .
15?
honestly .
who could be callin 'at this hour?
hello?
hel lo?
hey , mama .
melanie?
is that you?
oh , it's so late .
are you all right?
i , uh ... um ...
i just thought i'd surprise you .
well , this certainly is a fine surprise , hearing from you ... you know , being such a busy girl and all .
of course , i call people while i'm doin 'the dishes or shellin 'peas .
oprah calls it " multitasking .
mama , the call isn't the surprise .
i i'm in town .
oh , lord , love a duck !
ha !
oh , my baby girl has finally come home .
earl , she's in town .
you gonna repeat everything she says?
if you are , get off my chair .
mama ...
i'm just sittin 'here , is all .
what happened to the sound?
i turned it down so i could hear the phone ring .
mama !
what , are you a clairvoyant?
it was so loud , i couldn't hear myself think .
mama ...
they could have heard it at joe and lurlynn's house .
hello?
i only get 3 minutes .
oh , honey , you didn't need to call , then .
just come on by .
uh ... well , that's the thing .
i was sorta hoping daddy could come get me .
so , what put you in jail this time?
jake and his big , fat mouth .
it's just a misunderstanding , that's all .
yeah , kinda like that weddin 'i paid for , huh?
i would hardly call that a wedding .
boy was nervous .
he was still drunk from the night before .
can you blame him?
yes , i can !
i went to the reception by myself with puke all down my dress while he slept it off in the travelodge , and you're still siding with that ...
i'm not sidin 'with anybody .
the boy's changed , is all .
can we just not talk about jake , okay?
i i know he's the son you never had , but i'm your only daughter , and maybe you want to know what's new with me .
okay , shoot .
i met somebody ... and he's quite a catch .
h he's really a great guy .
and i'm happy ... really .
come to mama , sugar !
hey , mama .
oh , good land of the livin ', you are skin and bones .
well , don't i get a smile?
i know you got one in there somewhere .
come on , come on , let's not let all the bought air out .
well , are you hungry , sweetie?
do you want me to reheat you some chicken fried steak?
oh , no , mama , i'm fine .
sweetie , you look tired .
are you tired?
oh , you know what?
maybe it's the way you're wearing your hair now .
you guys have really done a lot with the place .
lord , would you listen to that accent?
why don't you sit in my good chair?
now , your mama got me this christmas before last .
oh , you mean the one where you were supposed to come visit me?
i told you time and time again , it just didn't suit .
let me ... let me get you those tickets .
sit down in it .
sit down .
now , watch this .
ahh !
oh !
oh !
i mean , isn't that quite the deal?
there are hardly words .
now , how do i get out of this thing?
oh ...
oh , my god !
jake tell you he's thinkin 'of gettin 'one?
oh , i see your priorities ...
jake , jail , and then home .
mama , it was just unfinished business , is all .
jake's doin 'all right .
boy's goin 'places .
once upon a time , you were goin 'places , too .
here are your tickets .
these were a gift .
i'd rather you guys just use them .
you know what i can't understand is how y'all will visit every stupid battlefield in the continental u. s. , but you can't manage to visit your only daughter .
well , the door swings both ways , sweetie .
anyway , don't get me started on the things i don't understand .
here we go .
your dream for me was to get out of this place and be somebody .
you shoved me in every beauty pageant in the state .
i'm just sayin ', is all .
what? !
what are you trying to say? !
i i mean , just tell me what i can do to make you happy !
just make yourself happy , darlin '.
done .
we're there , all right?
you know , i've really made something of myself .
i have a career .
people actually want to be me .
and somebody loves me , and i love him .
pearl , why don't you get us that baloney cake out the icebox?
your mama's a complex woman .
i'm going to bed .
good night , darlin '.
but you know nothing about her .
are you even sure who she is?
i love her , mom .
that's nice , but you have to be careful .
you and i are different .
we're not better , not worse ... we're just different .
we're in public life to serve , and to serve to the best of our abilities , we have to set good examples .
do you have to control everything?
i've put a hold on the plaza for the second weekend in june .
that should give you a nice , long engagement .
we were thinking christmas in ireland .
if you think i'm going to let some girl talk you into getting married
she is not " some girl .
any place but new york city .
she's my fiancee , for christ's sake .
you are just like your father .
one minute you're brilliant , controlled , steadfast .
the next you're throwing it all away on some young piece of ass .
those are your issues , mother .
not mine .
okay ...
hold on .
you know what?
uh ...
how long does a contested divorce take?
18 months? !
mr. buford , i don't have 18 months .
i don't have 18 days .
okay , well , that's just not gonna work for me .
u uh , ye yes .
whoo hoo !
don't see the likes of you around these here parts much !
mr. buford , that's not gonna work .
lady , you look like sex on a stick in that
frederick montana getup !
i have to call you back .
listen , bubba , why don't you just kiss my ... ... ass !
oh , my god !
get in the truck , there , missy ,
'cause i don't do that sort of thing on the street .
i guess your mama raised you right .
whoo !
what is that?
calvin klein?
that's very nice .
very good .
i i better back off .
don't want to get you in trouble with the little lady .
there is a little lady , isn't there?
i can hardly afford me , much less some high maintenance babe .
what about cindy what's her name?
you guys were real hot and heavy in high school .
she's a women's softball coach up in nashville .
mm hmm .
oh ...
well , that explains some lingering questions that i had about a game of post office we played one time .
no !
i guess we all have our little secrets , don't we , bobby ray?
yeah , we sure do .
'course , i read about yours on the internet .
what? !
oh , i know all about the cocks in your henhouse .
oh , god !
bobby ray !
you sure do know how to make a girl blush .
well , i gotta get back to the factory , but are you in town for a while?
oh , god , i hope not .
no , i'm just hitting the bank .

lost 110 pounds , i know .
well ... congratulations .
thanks .
uh ...
i noticed that you don't have an atm .
oh , them things .
russ don't want to put one in on account of you lose personal contact with the customers .
yes , that would be tragic .
wade said you and jake had quite the reunion .
but that's just pillow talk talkin '.
a are you and wade ...

'course , it ain't tiffany's .
but then again , you can't believe everything you hear on tv .

oh , i stumbled across a few things today .
holy shit !
what happened to the stove? !
oh , and where are them little magnets
i had over here , huh? !
what the hell is this ... chick food?
light beer ... less calories .
i tried to pick out a new bed , but have you been to the sit 'n sleep lately?
yuck .
i'll just have to order something from new york .
whatever blows your dress up , darlin '.
you go right ahead and spend your money .
oh , but , darlin '...
i thought you said we should think of it as ... our money .
just a guess , but i'm thinking the words " joint checking " are flashing in your head right now .
how much did you take?
all of it .
son of a bitch !
you want a wife , you got a wife .
and what are you doing with all that cash?
why don't you invest it?
don't you know anything? !
i know if you don't get out of this house right now ...
sign the papers , and i'll give it all back .
fine !
fine !
give me the pen .
hold on .
what are you doing with all that cash saved up?
and since when did you quit the tire factory?
you're not doing anything illegal , are you , jake? !
maybe i am .
so what?
i don't ask you about your boyfriend , you keep your nose out of my life ... deal?
who told you?
honey , just 'cause i talk slow doesn't mean i'm stupid .
look , jake ...
nobody finds their soul mate when they're 10 years old .
yeah , i guess .
i mean , where's the fun in that , right?
i can't believe you kept this thing all these years .
mm hmm .
most people don't know that lightning does that to sand .
oh , hey , mel , you know what?
i just remembered i got myself a hot date .
you don't mind if i have my lawyer take a look at these .
what? !
hell , i'm just a simple country boy .
there's words in there i can't even pronounce .
you might be takin 'me to the cleaners for all i know .
the cleaners?
you?
say , what did this set you back , anyhow?
more than you make in a month .

just picked up the " new york " magazine , and i quote ,
that cool breath of fresh air
blowing through the tents at fashion week
was the soon to be household name of melanie carmichael .
fashion insiders have labeled her 'the next big one . " '
oh , my god , " the next big one "?
oh , god , honey , i needed that almost as much as i need you .
what is that noise?
the sound of my past .
have fun .
okay , bye . # bright lights # # bright lights #

ooh , whoo !
who's the lucky guy?
his name is andrew .
he's in politics .
well , you got my vote .

oh , well , thank you .
um , look at you .
you have a baby ... in a bar .
hell , i got three more at home .
this one's still on the tit , so i can cart him anywhere .
right .
i almost bought that exact same top the other day .
but clinton'd kill me if i spent 30 bucks on a sweater thing .
ah , that jaclyn smith knows what she's doin '.
actually , it's mine .
bergdorf's just picked it up .
i design clothes now .
oh , mmm , now that you mention it ,
i'm ...
i'm pretty sure i heard that .
so , do you know jaclyn smith?
mind if i join you?
actually , we do .
you must be jake's hot date .
i'm starr .
hi , i'm melanie , jake's snotty yankee bitch wife , whom he refuses to divorce , even though i'm engaged to another man .
hot dog , jake , look at the size of that thing .
honey?
huh?
why don't you get us a couple drinks , all right?
okay .
is that a martini?
not " me and her " us .
you and l " us .
why do you make me be mean to you?
is that what you want ... to be humiliated in front of all of your friends?
oh , come on , mel , we were your friends , too .
well , looky , looky there !
well , well , well , if it isn't the two groomsmen of the apocalypse .
hey , eldon !
yep?
are you hungry? !
starved !
no , no , no !
no , don't you dare !
i could use a melanie sandwich !
just seems like old times , doesn't it?
get off me !
ugh !
no , not like old times , all right?
times have changed .
no more melanie sandwich , no more melanie taco , and no more melanie corn dog , all right?
sure ... sorry .
just playin 'with you .
come on , guys , just grab a stick .
let's play some pool , all right?
and if you can't find a cue , just pull the one shoved up her ass .
eldon , you're still wearing that same old stupid hat .
well , i ... just about got it broken in .
now , you sit your bony ass down there and watch and see me teach jake here how to lose at pool .
well , see , that's the thing .
i'm not really a watch and see kind of girl ... am i , jake?
come on , now , bobby ray , you got it .
bobby ray ...
don't blow this one , okay?
all right , baby?
you can take the girl out of the honky tonk , but you can't take the honky tonk out of the girl .
so , jake ... are you going to divorce this girl or what?
well , she waited 7 years .
a couple more days won't kill her ... unfortunately .
like it's gonna make a difference .
you never know .
you might be interested to learn jake has this whole ...
hey , hey , let her think whatever she wants , clinton .
she made up her mind about me a long time ago .
some things never change .
like eldon here !
he never could get his balls in the right pocket .
okay , jake , it's you and mel .
clutch time , man .
it's just like state playoffs .
we're down by 6 , 7 seconds to go .
we need that big , beautiful 52 yard bomb !
do you remember that , mel?
how could i forget?
that was the night jake got me pregnant .
ooh .
why don't you just go public with that shit?
oh , come on .
it's not like anybody can keep a secret around here ... except for bobby ray .
now , what did i ever do to you?
you never did anything to me , darlin '... or any other girl in town .
melanie , what is the matter with you?
what do you mean?
oh , she's just unhappy .
well , of course , i would be , too , if " women's wear daily " called me " less than mediocre .
why don't you just go to a gay bar? !
ooh !
now , what would " b " ray do at a gay bar?
well ...
i think i had about enough fun for one night .
oh , come on , i was just kidding .
hey , stella !
how 'bout another round of drinks for my friends here?
honey , i think you've had about enough .
you know what?
i think you're right .
i have had enough .
i mean , how do you people live like this , anyway?
all right , that's it , that's it .
come on .
did you know that there's a great , big world out there?
it has absolutely nothin 'to do with chitlins or children or beer !
i liked her better when she was crazy .
jake !
what makes you think you can treat them
like somethin 'you stepped in in them fancy shoes , huh? !
you asked for it !
i asked for it? !
you show up here , you steal my money , you rearrange my house , and then you insult my friends , actin 'like you're better than 'em !
i am better than them !
and you stole my pen !
that's all that matters to you , isn't it?
jake ...
the money ... the labels , the shoes ... you're pathetic !
oh , like you're goin 'places !
well , i am as soon as i get my keys out of here .
oh , no , you don't .
no , you don't , mel .
give me my purse !
you want to kill yourself?
you want to kill yourself , you do it somewhere else .
at least i'm doin 'somethin 'with my life .
so what if you can't play football anymore? !
get a new dream !
get in the car .
get in the truck , mel .
i did .
all right !
so , i ... guess the date's over , huh?
do me a favor .
hmm?
follow us home .
blah !
earl .
evening , jake .
pearl .
jake .
oh !
mmm ...
my battle's in the day and runs on into tomorrow morning .
be still .
i can't fasten this .
if we win , i might stick around for old billy's rabbit stew .
if we lose , i'll be home .
tomorrow , then , sweetie .
now , listen , pearl , you go easy on her .
there .
oh , we were wondering when we were gonna see you .
christ almighty , daddy .
how am i gonna explain you in new york city?
history's history .
no use sweepin 'it under the rug .
wish me luck .
go get them yankees .
people need a passport to come down here .

come on , come on .
there you go , there you go .

well ...
i been spendin 'a lot of my time up around tuscaloosa , so ...
how deep is that water?
about 8 feet .
look , mel ...
i signed your papers .
jake , i never meant to hurt you , or anybody else , for that matter .
and i just came out here to say ... thank you .
you might want to find yourself a place out of the way .
you can't just leave !
sure i can .
you want to come?
where you goin '?
well ...
i want to show you somethin '.
i can't .
can't or won't?
both .
the girl i knew used to be fearless .
the girl you knew didn't have a life .
well , i ... guess you better get on with it , then .
come on , bryant !
come on , boy , get in here .
e excuse me , do you know bobby ray bailey's address?
813 lafayette .
you don't remember me , do you?
oh , i remember you just fine .
you used to steal catfish from my pond .
yes , sir .
i did that .
i'm sorry .
'course , on the weekends ,
bobby ray goes over to the carmichael plantation ... visits with colonel murphy ... it being tourist season and all .
thank you .
yes?
oh , hi !
i'm melanie carmi ... um , um , melanie smooter .

bobby ray?
melanie? !

yee haw !
hot damn !
hold your fire , sir .
i'll be right back .
we weren't aimin 'for ya , but i doubt i would have gone to your funeral .
i guess i wouldn't blame you .
forgotten how beautiful this place was .
guess it doesn't take much to forget a lot of things .
bobby ray , it's not like that .
you know what?
i'll tell you what it's not like .
it's not like jake's the only one that you run out on .
i'm so sorry i outed you .
i guess i figured if i was pointing at you , then ... nobody would see through me .
bobby ray , i can't find the fuse !
i should go before he kills himself .
bye .
afternoon .
can i help you?
barry lowenstein , " new york post .
ho ho , boy , am i glad to see you .
i'll tell you , it's , uh ... definitely , uh , another world down here .
uh , did you say the " post "?
yes , i did .
i i was hoping to get an interview with you and your family ... maybe , um , a few pictures if you don't mind?
no .
i mean , uh , yes , i do ... mind .
they're not here .
oh ... wow .
this is just as you described it .
it must have been amazing , huh , growing up here?
like a fantasy .
would you mind if i take a quick look inside?
actually , i'm on my way out .
i'll come back , then .
uh , uh , okay , but just a peek .
this is it ... home sweet home .
wow !
how old is this place?
uh ... it was built by my , uh , great great great grandfather ,
charles carmichael , in 1853 .
oh , boy , i bet you slid down this banister a time or two .
oh .
and over here we have the , um ...
... kitchen , but who hasn't seen one of those?
let's start over here .
oh .
now , this is my favorite room .
it was part of the , um , underground railroad .
why are we whispering?
the whole place is haunted ... by ghosts of , um , the civil war soldiers .
jake !
no wonder we lost the war .
was that one of 'em?
melanie?
what are you doin 'in a closet?
hi .
barry lowenstein , " new york post .
miss carmichael is just showing me around the plantation .
uh , mr. lowenstein is writing a piece on the family , you know , since i'm marrying the mayor's son and all .
i had no idea .
isn't that something?
yeah .
well , a plantation by any other name is just a farm .
but it does roll off the tongue a little sweeter , doesn't it?
huh .
well , i do believe miss melanie forgot her manners .
i'm bobby ray ... her cousin .
charmed .
see , when the yankees marched through alabama , they tried to destroy our metal formin 'capabilities by placin 'barrels of powder underneath the anvils .
of course , all that managed to do was blow 'em sky high for a few seconds .
so ... in honor of that act of stupidity , we all ... we get together to re create it for the tourists .
aah !
yee haw !
what the hell was that? !
hey , grandpa !
this here's barry !
he's doin 'an article on melanie's weddin '!
never heard of her .
thanks !
well , aren't you just a big , fat liar .
bobby ray !
oh , go back to new york .
# if fear's what makes us decide #
# our future journey #
# well , i'm not along for a life #
# i'm not along for a life #
# 'cause i'm still yearning #
# i i i am falling down #
# try and stop me #
# it feels so good to hit the ground #
# you can watch me #
# i fall right on my face #
# it's an uphill human race #
# and i i am falling down #
hmm .
hello .
i'm sorry about what i said .
really sorry .
melanie , forget it .
she was not sharing .
okay , y'all , you need to eat and be quiet .
we're gonna have us a little visit .
# ye a , ye a , ye a , yeah #
# oh , i i i am falling down #
# try and stop me #
# it feels so good to hit the ground #
you know , he went up there .
who?
jake?
when?
about a year after you left .
he doesn't know i know , but clinton let it slip once .
jake was in new york?
he told clinton he'd never seen anything like it .
he realized straight off he'd need more than an apology to win you back .
he needed to conquer the world first .
he's been tryin 'ever since .
that's why he kept sending the papers back .
yeah .
hmm .
it's funny how things don't work out .
it's funny how they do .
# now , listen here #
# well , i tried to tell you , baby #
# but that don't make no sense #
# now you got me , baby #
# up against that fence #
# ain't that a shame? # # shame #
# shame , shame the way you do #
ha ha !
ha !
hey , look who i found hangin 'out by the parkin 'lot .
hesitant to join us .
# shame , shame , shame on you #
anybody think of anything in here that , uh , might bother bobby ray?
uh , clinton's breath?
ha !
you still the same bobby ray from last night?
last time i checked , yeah .
well , then , i'm gonna buy you a drink .
well , you're really not my type , i mean ...
oh , honey , you ... you drink that from the top .
i'm just lookin 'to see who makes this deep south glass .
i wonder if you can get it in new york .
it's beautiful .
hey , jake , mel would like to know where she can find some of that snooty faluty glass .
why ask me?
oh , i don't know .
maybe because you're ...
you're all spiffed up and ... and all .
am i missin 'somethin '?
let's show some respect .
jake ...
when was the last time you pushed me around the floor?
clinton here has got two left feet .
well , ms. taylor , i'd be honored .
let's do it .
come on .
come on , mel , get on out here !
well , aren't you the lord of the dance?
i ain't as clumsy as i look .
she just can't keep time .
you might have to prove that to me .
whoo !
# now , i heard mr. young sing about her #
you know , he's pretty good .
it might be you .
oh , the hell you say .
let me at him .
# i hope neil young will remember #
aw , look at them two welded together .
why do they fight it?
# sweet home alabama #
maybe we could just talk .
# sweet home alabama #
# lord , i'm comin 'home to you #
come on , let's go to the roadhouse .
nah .
what do you say we drive out to fairview and bowl?
i don't think so .
do you want to go harass somebody?
unh unh .
hey , i know this great place where we can ...
no !
y'all , i think i'm gonna call it a night .
hi , there , boy .
sorry it took me so long .
i would have come sooner if i'd known you were sick .
actually , that's probably not true .
i've been pretty selfish lately .
dogs don't know anything about that , do they , though?
you were always like a big old pillow .
like when everything went pear shaped ...
you never left my side .
and then i just left you .
i bet you sat there wondering what you'd done wrong .
i told him it was my fault .
quit bein 'so nice .
it's the truth .
how come it has to be so complicated?
what?
truth ...
he was one hell of a good dog , wasn't he?
yeah .
you looked like you were having fun out there tonight .
i'm happy in new york , jake .
but then i come down here and ... this fits , too .
since when does it have to be one or the other?
you can have roots and wings , mel .
maybe i could just fly south for the winter .
look .
what?
there .
do you see 'em?
lightning bugs?
only you .
you know , i still go out there sometimes .
i see those big thunderheads rollin 'in .
it's like a religion .
i had a dream about it the other night .
you ever wonder what would have happened if we hadn't have gotten pregnant?
jake ...
just ...
let me get this out before i can't .
i thought that baby would be an adventure .
and it took me a while to realize it would have been your only adventure .
i just guess mother nature knew better , huh?
i was so ashamed ... ... 'cause i felt ... relieved .
and all of a sudden , i just ... needed a different life .
you done real well for yourself .
i'm proud of you , mel .
i'm just sorry i never danced with you at our weddin '.
i'm sure this next one's gonna go better for ya .
jake , i can't do this .
hey ...
i know .
go home .
well , i'm just sayin ', is all .
i mean , i ...
i saw the way you two were lookin 'at each other .
will you just shut up about it , mama? !
i can't help the way jake feels about me !
he hasn't done anything wrong !
he hasn't done anything right either !
i can't believe i'm even having this argument !
i'm leaving !
i'm gone !
i'm marrying another man !
yes , that's right , you get a second chance , so please don't mess it up !
for who?
for me or for you?
don't sass me , okay?
don't you dare sass me , 'cause i have put up with an awful lot from you over the years .
like what? !
l like me quitting your precious pageants?
i didn't want you to end up like me !
damn it !
now , you need to stay as far away from here as you can .
that boy is quicksand .
what's so wrong with being you , mama?
i just think that you deserve better , that's all .
i know you do .
you always have .
i'll see you in new york , all right?
mm hmm .
you'll like it .
i promise .
now , don't you forget to say goodbye to your daddy .
fire !
fire !
fire !
fire !
fire !
daddy?
daddy?
daddy !
who ya lookin 'for , darlin '?
earl smooter .
5th regiment?
anybody seen earl smooter?
he's about to surrender !
thank you !
after you .
afternoon .
how are ya?
good , thanks .
yourself?
no complaints .
that's a beautiful house .
sure .
yeah .
you , uh , you here to see bobby ray?
actually , i'm , uh , hoping to surprise melanie .
melanie?
my fiancee .
you got the wrong house , don't ya?
this is , uh , the carmichael place , isn't it?
are we talkin 'about the same girl?
melanie smooter?
melanie carmichael .
oh , well , that explains it .
that sure does .
andrew hennings .
nice meeting you , jake .
hey , jake .
what's goin 'on?
oh , you know ,
i'm just , uh , talkin 'to mel's fiance here .
wonder if you might know where she is .
andrew hennings .
you must be ...
i i'm bobby ray ... her , uh , cousin?
i see you've already met jake ... her , uh ...
other cousin .
family !
god , it's great to meet you both .
i think melanie said somethin 'last night about , uh , visitin 'her daddy u up at the ... up at the battlefield .
the battlefield?
you know us southerners .
i mean , the minute the confederacy died , it became a moral issue .
come on , i'll , uh , i'll give you a ride up there .
that's great .
thank you .
all right .
nice meeting you .
# what this world needs is a few more rednecks #
# so people ain't afraid to take a stand #
so , who's ...
melanie ...
smooter?
local hero around here .
why is that?
she blew up the bank .
and that made her a hero?
well , notorious , anyway .
she was 10 .
oh .
fortunately , nobody was hurt ... except , maybe , the cat .
what cat?
the one with the dynamite on its back .
she blew up a cat?
he was scheduled to die .
from dynamite?
the vet said it had cancer , so eldon thought it'd be put in one of those chambers , you know , the ones that suck their lungs out .
little mel , she couldn't bear the thought of that .
she , uh , she wanted somethin 'more humane .
yeah , sure .
so , they were doing some blastin 'out by the new highway .
so , we , uh , we took old fuzz up there , taped him up .
used about 30 feet of fuse just to be on the safe side , said our prayers , and ran like hell .
of course .
so , there we were , sittin 'in virgie's diner , feelin 'pretty blue .
when mel looks up and sees that damn cat , trottin 'down the road , searchin 'for eldon .
no shit .
yeah , and we would have caught him , too , but once that fuse hit his tail , boom , he took off like a shot .
and into the bank .
well ... the theory is , he probably wriggled loose from the explosive .
'cause , uh , people still see him from time to time , scorched tail and all .
he's a little skittish around humans .
that's quite a story .
she was quite a girl .
# a little less talk and a little more action #
whatever happened to her?
# and a few more rednecks ... #
oh , you know ... wound up pregnant , married some loser right out of high school .
are you surprised?
what are you doing here?
well , i came to deliver your fiance .
i think she was talking to me .
jake ...
must be exhaustin '.
what?
what?
livin 'a lie .
what's he talking about?
you and i are in love with two different people .
is he a second cousin?
he's my husband .
your what?
i mean my ex husband .
you married your cousin? !
no , i came down here to finalize my divorce .
hey , darlin ', thought that was you .
must be your new someone .
earl smooter ... glad to meet ya .
melanie smooter .
andrew , wait .
wait !
andrew !
wait !
i just ...
please .
let me try and explain myself !
you don't understand !
this is not who i am anymore !
look , i don't know who you are or what else you lied about , but i know one thing ... there is a lear jet in mobile , and i am on it .
i know you're thinkin '
i spoiled things good this time .
oh , hon , don't go accusin 'me of thinkin '.
i ain't done anything of the sort .
anyway , spoiled's in the eye of the beholder ... ... like these plums here .
some people might call them " spoiled " ... but i think that , um , these almost ruined ones sometimes make the sweetest jam .
do you need any help?
it was kind of fun , seeing daddy up there , surrendering .
yeah .
he sure does have a flair for the dramatic .
you certainly don't get it from my side of the family .
hey , y'all .
look who i found walkin 'down l 58 .
hi .
hi .
i thought you'd be halfway to new york by now .
so did i.
ooh , if i'd known company was comin ',
i'd have put on the dog .
this is my mama .
hi .
she makes the best jam in three counties .
oh .
and my dad ... you ... you already met him .
yeah .
and this is our home .
this is where i grew up .
well , it's a pleasure meeting you both .
i'm ...
andrew hennings ...
melanie's fiance ... well ... that is ... if ... if she'll still have me .
look , mel ...
i really don't care what happened down here .
so ... you have a past .
i mean , who doesn't?
what i need to know is if there is a place for me in your future .
oh , good lord .
that is the sweetest thing .
well , go on .
oh !
hello , new york city !
woman , what the hell you gassin 'about?
well , sir ... my mother happens to be the mayor up there , and , uh , she'd like nothing better than a big , snazzy new york wedding .
well , uh ... yeah , i suppose i can take off work .
andrew , i , um ... actually , i was thinking , maybe we could have the wedding here .
here .
in my hometown .
look , mel , if you're worried about the money , don't .
it's not about the money , andrew ... not down here .
you know ... a lot of people are expecting us to get married in the city , but i think a nice , quiet , country wedding is just the ticket .
earl ...
pearl , if you ... if you folks could take care of the rehearsal dinner ,
i'd really like to take care of the rest .
well , i think we could cover that .
heck .
how many times does your only daughter get married?
other than before .
felony melanie?
she was never convicted .
oh ho .
i don't know which is worse ... child cat killer or sons of the confederacy .
what would you suggest i do ... dump her for being poor?
you're supposed to be a democrat , remember?
there is nothing wrong with being poor .
i get elected by poor people , and i'm a big enough person to commend her for making something of herself .
what upsets me is that she lied to you .
so what?
she was ashamed of her background .
who hasn't been embarrassed by their parents at one point?
i'm going to assume that was a rhetorical question .
assume away .
no one is going to change my mind about this ... not you , not the media , not anyone .
fine ... but admit it ...
i was right .
yes ... you were right .
there is a wedding in your future , whether you like it or not .
and how , exactly , does little miss alabama plan to accommodate 500 people?
i suppose she has connections at the jail .
well , there are several excellent choices ... the travelodge , days inn , a motel 6 , oh , and the golden cherry motel , where we will be .
laugh now , but if this gets out ...
it won't .
the press expects the plaza in june .
# something's #
# been creepin 'into my head #
# turnin 'my thoughts #
# into a dizzy red #
now , let's talk about your wedding .
this place is gorgeous , and we can control the security .
the carmichael plantation?
it did inspire your identity , did it not?
you thought of everything .
yeah , well , i always do .
been great .
keep in touch .
# now you have come #
# to get some lofty role #
# oh , you got me walkin 'backwards #
# you got me thinkin 'sideways #
# you got me talkin 'circles #
# you got me losin 'my way #
# you got me crossin 'every line #
# you got me just in #
# time #
you guys remember the sheik .
yeah .
well , he proposed to me , and i think i loved him , despite his billions .
then why didn't you say " yes "?
because i hesitated long enough to realize my head and my heart were saying two different things .
it's this way .
yeah .
well , it's a big decision .

i sure hope this weather cooperates .
it's supposed to be a big one .
you know , jake ...
you're my only son ... and i love you , but sometimes ... you are too much like your daddy .
she made her decision , mama .
for somebody who's been holdin 'onto somethin 'so hard , you're pretty quick to let it go .
you know , i can't control her any more than i can control the weather .
it's just nerves .
you're doin 'the right thing .
am i?
when i married your daddy ... oh , lord , but i was a fool for that man .
i couldn't put one foot in front of the other .
i remember standin 'there , thinkin ',
oh , preacher , hurry up before he changes his mind .
look where it got me .
sometimes that man makes me so mad ,
i could just wring his neck .
but you still love him .
god knows i do .
and only he knows why .
mama ...
i think i ...
he can give you a life that we never dreamed of .
and he adores you .
he does , doesn't he?

mr. buford , he signed the papers .
what are you doing here?
he did ... you didn't .
what?
you mean i'm still married?
well , not unless you want to be .
oh , for god's sakes , melanie .
i thought you took care of this .
it's an honest mistake , andrew .

does anybody have a pen?
mom?

andrew ...
you don't want to marry me .
i don't?
no .
no , you don't ... not really .
you see , the truth is ...
i gave my heart away a long time ago ...
my whole heart ... and i never really got it back .
and i i don't even know what else to say , but i'm sorry .
i can't marry you .
and you shouldn't want to marry me .
wow .
so this is what this feels like .
that's it? !
you're just gonna let her humiliate you with some bullshit about an old husband? !
yeah .
yeah .
i think i am .
excuse me .
you ...
in my entire life ...
i have never met anyone so manipulative , so deceitful !
and i'm in politics !
i'm just trying to be honest .
i will not allow the future president of the united states to be dumped at the altar by some psycho daisy mae !
you go after him , you little bitch !
wait just a minute , missy .
uh , there ... there's no need for name callin ', now .
now , she spoke her piece , and that's all there is to it .
oh , go back to your double wide and fry something .
nobody talks to my mama like that !
praise the lord !
the south has risen again !

if you're friends of the bride , stick around !
i'm gonna go find me a groom !
hey , cowboy ...

yeah .
why didn't you tell me you came to new york?
i needed to make somethin 'of myself .

what is it about you southern girls?
you can't make the right decisions
'til you tried all the wrong ones?
