paula got her teeth and a new dad .
and me ... yes .
unfortunately , we cannot go over to the caf moskow to drink to your health , but we're all together .
and that's the most important thing .
we didn't always make it easy for you , but you were always there for us .
and , by any rate , i can't think of a better family than ours .
and that's what i wanted to thank you for .
mum , you're the best mother in the world .
alex?
and we all love you .
alex? .
what's the matter?
what's that?
that's ...
yes , what's the meaning of that?
i don't know what the comrades are doing there again ...
a fata morgana .
that's from the west .
it's a mirage .
it will have been approved somehow .
please calm down , mum !
there's an explanation for everything .
right ...
boys , please sing something , will you?
lara !
wait a moment , i ...
lara? .
build up , build up " .
what's the matter all of a sudden?
build up .
for a better future ... we build up our home ...
i'm sorry for your mother .
what you're doing is too scary for me .
and what is this nonsense about my father being a teacher for the deaf and dumb .
he was a simple cook , you know that .
but she rejoiced in that .
what should i've told her?
that he's dead?
in her state?
you mean to say , when you're lying already , it doesn't make any difference anyway .
cheers for her , cheers for her ...
lara !
cheers for her , cheers for her ... three cheers for her !
cheers , cheers , cheers !
just a little further away .
just a little further away .
just a little more ..
watch out , will you?
we're filming here !
can i see your authorization?
didn't he inform you?
me?
who?
oh , what was his name?
something with " m " .
i'll just go and ask around .
until then , you don't film anything !
got the logo?
yes .
sharpness on me? yes .
we're waiting for the evening sun .
don't overdo it , the guy will be back soon .
just you wait .
with the evening sun it'll look brill .
when i stared at the clouds on that day , i realized that the truth was just a doubtful matter , that i could adapt to mother's familiar surroundings . familiar surroundings .
i only had to study the language of " current camera " ... and spur on denis 'ambition as a film director .
today gnther mittag , secretary for economy in the cc of the sud , visited the coca cola group in west berlin .
the reason for the comrade's visit are ... details of the completed trade agreement between coca cola ... and the veb drink collective combine leipzig .
security officers of west berlin hinder the work of the gdr television .
surely , the capitalistic press censors find the loss the mighty
coca cola group has suffered against the veb drink collective combine leipzig ... in the patent procedure too embarrassing ...
please let the gdr television work undisturbed !
that's it , i'm calling the police !
a testimonial of international scientists now finally confirmed to the collective combine , that the original coca cola flavour was developed in the 50s in laboratories of the gdr .
back to the studio .
coca cola is a socialist drink?
i thought , cola existed before the war .
don't you understand , mum?
the west ripped us off all these years !
until the end of august 593 deaths by drugs were registered .
60 % more than in the year before .
now i remember !
what?
where i hid the money .
in the living room .
in the small chest of drawers .
in the left drawer under the wax paper .
the old rubbish with the red dot is going to the bulk waste .
how could i forget?
hey , here i am !
oh , hello !
and?
has she swallowed it?
yes , of course .
really?
has she really swallowed it?
i'm telling you .
they've driven us this far !
good evening , mister ganske .
they betrayed us and sold us out !
the lack of sharpness didn't irritate her?
no .
and for that we worked 40 years ...
we could rebuild a studio .
we would have different possibilites with a blue box .
what ... what are you doing there?
and?
what should we do with it?
exchange it , of course .
i'm sorry , but the deadline expired 2 days ago .
i'm sorry , but the deadline expired 2 days ago .
but it's a special case .
we've only just found it today .
it's even okay for us , if you exchange 1 to 4 or 1 to 5 ...
i'm afraid there is no prolongation .
and we wouldn't have exchanged cash anyway .
that can't be !
it has to be possible !
i'm sure you heard me .
time's up !
your time is up soon , you bastard !
these are 30, 000 east marks !
that was our money , for 40 damned years !
now you western fuck want to tell me , this isn't worth anything?
please leave our premises now .
keep your hands off !
and what are you all gawking at?
it used to be your money , too !
keep your hands off !
you assholes !
are you going mad or what?
i felt like a commander of a submarine in the northsea fleet , whose battle hardened steel skin had sprung a leak .
everytime i closed a leak , another one opened .
ariane denied being my brother in arms , the class enemy raised his cola flag and a fresh wind from the west blew mother's east money around my ears .
what're you laughing about?
yell .
why?
you have to vent some air .
open up your valves .
just yell !
in summer 1990 , the german national team exceeded the plan ... and became world cup holder .
and mother kept on getting better .
the pullover marked " size 48 " has the width of a " size 54
the pullover marked " size 48 " has the width of a " size 54 " and the length of a " size 38 " .
full stop .
i don't know how the employees of milena come to these measurements .
in the capital there are no people who are so small and square .
full stop .
christiane , that's good .
if it's our fault ...
if it's ... our fault ... that we cannot accommodate the central plan with our sizes , comma ... we would like to apologize for that .
full stop .
in this case ... we shall endeavour to become , comma ... in the future , smaller and squarer .
full stop .
with socialist salutations .
hanna schfer .
hello , mrs. schfer .

alright , boss .
have you gone nuts?
you can't just let the boys in here !
but why?
she was pleased , wasn't she?
you can't do anything right with you easties !
having something to complain about is what matters to you most !
you're just like your mother and her stupid gdr inputs .
my mother doesn't grumble !
she's trying to change the conditions of the society step by step through constructive criticism .
sure .
and you were never interested in that !
nope .
haven't you noticed?
we're in the socialist veteran's club .
good evening .
why don't you take admission fees?
yeah , let's charge admission fees !
you be quiet .
he's bought a trabbi .
really?
an estate car .
that can't be happening .
paula will get a defect , if this goes on much longer .
oh come on !
20 years in the gdr didn't harm our health , did they?
i've really got my doubts about you .
shit .
shit !
well done .
get a cloth .
what is it?
nosebleeds again .
i know it's a little stressful at the moment i'd also prefer , if we didn't have to ...
i saw dad ... earlier .
where? .
at work .
i recognized his voice immediately .
what did he say?
3 cheeseburgers and 2 portions of chips with mayonnaise , please .
3 cheeseburgers and 2 portions of chips with mayonnaise , please .
um , 3 cheeseburgers and 2 portions of chips with mayonnaise !
and ... what does he look like?
he drives a volvo estate car and got glasses with a golden rim .
what did you tell him?
enjoy your meal and thank you for choosing burger king .
enjoy your meal and thank you for choosing burger king .
my father lived somewhere in this city .
i saw his image in my mind .
a fat guy who stuffed himself with cheeseburgers and chips all day .
he lived in his world and i lived in mine .
he didn't have anything to do with me and i didn't have anything to do with him .
hold still or it won't work .
will it take much longer?
'cause i have to be home in 2 hours at the latest .
you always have to be somewhere in 2 hours .
it's getting boring .
oh great .
i got a sick mother , a demanding job ... and a miffed girlfriend .
i've got my exams in 2 days .
it's second nature to you .
this little bit of putting a plaster on .
then i can stop learning , can't i?
i was well meant .
i believe in you .
lara , stop this shit , please !
you have to tell your mother !
what?
you have to tell your mother !
not because of me , but because of her !
lara !
what?
shit !
lara !
the life in our little country became ever faster .
somehow we were all just like atoms in a big particle accelerator .
but away from all the frantic pace of the new time there was a place of quiet ,
but away from all the frantic pace of the new time there was a place of quiet , silence and leisureliness , where i could finally have a lie in .
well , paula .
alex didn't use to be so tired when he came home from work .
our paula's learning to walk , alex !
there !
there !
there !
see?
i can do it , too .
paula !
see?
my little paula .
come to your granny .
come , come .
now we'll show alex , what we can do , okay?
right ...
now let's see just how far your granny can walk .
hi !
hi !
good afternoon .
young man , can i just sit down for a moment here please?
of course .
you're not from here , are you?
nope , from wuppertal .
from the west?
mum?
mum , what are you doing?
come on .
mum !
what is it with you?
you can't just get up !
shit .
what's actually happening here?
central committee of the socialist ...
unity party of ...
germany .
sound is in order .
right .
right .
i'm ready .
camera running .
3 , 2 , 1 ...
berlin .
still running .
berlin .
in a historic special session of the central committee of the social unity party of germany ... the general secretary of the sug's cc and chairman of the gdr's council of state ,
comrade erich honecker , in a great matter of humanitarian politeness , consented to the entering of the country by people from the frg who've been requesting exile at the gdr embassies in prague and budapest .
in this development , honecker sees ... a change in the east west relations and promised every man and woman entering the country ... a change in the east west relations and promised every man and woman entering the country ... a welcome money of 200 east marks .
unemployment , bad future prospects ... and the increasing election victories of the neo nazi republicans ... made the unnerved frg citizens turn their backs on the capitalism to try and start ... a new life in the country of workers and farmers .
here they park , the new gdr citizens from the frg .
the entering frg citizens were accommodated in the berlin districts ...
center " und " friedrich's grove " .
the cc of the sug ... created the campaign " solidarity west " because of the historic situation , to make sure all the new citizens receive proper living space .
somehow i have to admit that my game started to break free .
maybe the gdr i created for my mother , was the one i would have liked to have .
citizens who are ready to accommodate a refugee from the frg , please report to their section plenipotentiary .
how many are there already?
i don't know .
ten , twenty thousand?
look at that .
the people want to come into our country .
where are they all going to live?
they'll find something .
you've heard it , they're taking care of it .
no , children .
this is our responsibility .
we have to help .
but how do you think we can?
i mean , there's no room left in here .
our holiday home .
our holiday home?
we could do it up .
i wanted to get out there anyway .
congratulations .
you've done a great job .
now she wants to go to the holiday home .
you'll have to redecorate the entire city .
why don't you start?
but i'm telling you one thing , i won't take this any further .
ariane and i'll get a bigger apartment .
in 4 weeks we're out of here .
what?
i'm pregnant .
again?
can't you be more careful?
don't you think paula is enough?
and mum?
you can't leave me alone !
then take some refugees .
you're so cynical .
you want her to die , don't you?
and so the unity of our little family was restored .
that's your child .
and this is the heart .
amazing !
an all german baby was on its way .
and all german contracts ...
an all german baby was on its way .
and all german contracts ... were signed .
in moskow , they calculated that 2 and 4 equals one and drank krim champagne to all german brotherhood .
in berlin we took our first all german trip .
i'm not a little child anymore .
please take off the cloth .
don't look !
where are we going?
the surprise stays a surprise !
the trabbi smells so new .
what colour does it have?
you've waited 3 years , another half an hour won't make a difference .
that's right .
mum?
oh , it's beautiful .
sky blue .
right , and now turn around .
oh my god .
the garden .
remember the time alex locked himself in the bathroom?
we knocked and knocked .
not a sound .
i climbed out of a hole and watched all the excitement from the tree .
i climbed out of a hole and watched all the excitement from the tree .
and i laughed so hard , i wet myself .
what's happened in the 8 months i overslept?
is she asleep?
yeah .
you've become adults , that must be it .
you look more and more like your father .
you look more and more like your father .
mum ...
i've lied to you all this time .
it's all different from what you think .
mum , what are you talking about?
your father ...
your father didn't stay in the west because of another woman .
i lied .
and i also lied about ...
not hearing anything from him again .
he wrote letters to me ... and to you .
they're all ... in the kitchen cupboard .
they made things so hard for him .
just because he wasn't in the party .
it was dreadful .
he didn't let anyone notice .
but i knew .
i ... knew and i couldn't help him .
and then ... there suddenly was this congress in west berlin .
we only had 2 days to think .
your father wanted to stay in the west and i ...
i was supposed to follow with you .
well , i couldn't do it .
i ...
i was very frightened .
you don't know , how it is .
filling in an exit permit ... with 2 children .
you can't get out immediately .
you have to wait endlessly !
sometimes even years .
and you ...
they could have taken you away from me .
do you understand?
yes .
i didn't go .
it was the worst mistake of my life .
i know that now .
i lied to you .
please forgive me !
my dear robert ...
i thought about you so often ...
i would so much like to see you once more .
the same evening mother's condition suddenly worsened .
your mother had another heart attack , just as i feared .
at the moment , she's relatively stable .
but i'm afraid ... we have to expect the worst .
i'm sorry .
the doctors can be wrong .
alex , don't lie to yourself .
here , i found it .
he lives in wannlake .
i know , it's her last wish .
but i couldn't bring myself to go there .
mum's not going to die .
bye .
now you can accommodate someone after all .
accommodate?
who?
someone from the west .
you have to sleep .
if you want you you can sleep lie down in the nurses 'room .
there he was .
the idol of my youth .
sigmund jhn .
like a conjured spirit of my childhood sigmund jhn .
he didn't give autographs , he didn't talk to pioneers about the secrets of the universe , the freedom you have in zero gravity or the eternity of the cosmos .
he drove a small , stinking lada taxi .
where do you want to go?
to wannlake .
i know what you're thinking .
that's what many people think .
but that's not who i am .
we were flying through the night .
just like through the depths of the cosmos .
light years away from the solar system , past strange galaxies ... with unknown lifeforms , we landed in wannlake .
could you wait a moment?
i won't be long .
good evening .
hello .
come in .
is mr. kerner there?
the buffet is outside .
over there .
hello .
good evening .
hello !
good evening !
hello !
sandman , dear sandman , it isn't time yet ...
we send the evening greetings ... before all the children have to go to bed .
you surely have time left .
you surely have time left .
hello .
hello .
hello .
may i watch the sandman with you?
only if you tell us your name .
may i watch the sandman with you?
only if you tell us your name .
alexander .
look , today the sandman is an astronaut .
where i come from it's called cosmonaut .
where do you come from?
from a different country .
hi , you little bears .
hello , dad .
hello .
how are you?
fine .
so , are you also a fan of the sandman?
yes , i am .
excuse me , do we know each other?
yes , we do .
yes .
i can't think of it .
please help me .
his name's alexander .
alex?
robert .
robert !
we're all waiting for you out here .
robert , come out !
robert , we all know that you like to hide in the bathroom on these occasions .
dad , you have to give your speech .
robert , come out here .
i'll be back .
oh , i see him .
you've kept us waiting .
onto the stage !
well , i thank you all for coming here .
thank you and ... enjoy the evening .
thanks . enjoy the evening .
thanks .
i'm sorry for having this party here tonight .
had i known you'd come , i ...
strange , i've always thought you've got a swimming pool .
we've got a lake nearby .
my god , i didn't even recognize you .
now i got 2 new brothers and sisters , hm?
for 3 years , every day i waited for a message from you .
every day .
it was my most fervent wish .
why have you come?
mum's dying .
she had a heart attack .
she wants to see you once more .
what was it like up there?
up there?
oh ... up there .
it was wonderful up there .
just very far away from home .
the wall is no more .
there's no frontier !
it's not that bad .
it's all just one country now !
i don't understand a word .
it's all untrue .
that's why you have to play along .
and why did i come back to the gdr?
i don't know .
just think of something !
no , it's absurd .
i can't do that .
you just have to overcome it , then it'll be easy .
mum .
yes .
ouch .
i want to get up .
how do i look?
you can go in now .
and please remember , not a word !
yes , yes .
what did you talk about?
is that important?
how long has he been in there?
more than an hour .
i hope he doesn't let the cat out of the bag .
the summer was over .
i decided to end the whole sham .
but once more we were about to celebrate the anniversary of our socialist fatherland .
but in contrast to reality ... as a dignified farewell .
pst !
yes?
camera running .
start at 3 .
dear citizens of the german democratic republic .
if you've lived to see the wonder of watching our blue planet ... from the depths of the cosmos ...
the eve of the reunification .
and?
here .
my best film yet , buddy .
too bad no one but your mother will ever see it .
thank you , denis .
without you , it would never ...
yeah , it's alright .
here you go .
zoom off , before it gets sentimental .
and tell me how it was !
on the occasion of today's annual anniversary of the gdr , erich honecker resigned ... from all his functions .
what?
we ensure our friends in the world that the socialism ... in his speech on the ceremony for the gdr's anniversary ... in the republic's palace , erich honecker justified his decision by saying that the changes achieved in the gdr in the past few months ... completed his political life's work .
sigmund jhn .
what , jhn?
in 1978 , sigmund jhn was the first german cosmonaut in space .
the new head of state addressed the gdr's population in the evening .
dear citizens of the german democratic republic .
if you've lived to see the wonder of watching our blue planet ... from the depths of the cosmos , you see things differently .
up there , in the depths of space , the people's lives ...
up there , in the depths of space , the people's lives ... seem small and insignificant .
you ask yourself what humanity has accomplished .
which objectives did we set , which objectives did we realize?
today is our country's anniversary .
it's a very little country , seen from the cosmos .
but still thousands of people came to us last year .
people who we looked to as enemies and who want to live here with us today .
we know our country is not perfect .
but what we believe in , inspired a lot of people in the whole world .
maybe we have drifted off course from time to time .
but we collected ourselves .
socialism doesn't mean
living behind a wall .
socialism means reaching out to others , and living with others .
not just to dream about a better world , but to make the world a better place . but making it a better world .
i have therefore decided to open the gdr borders .
shortly after the fall of the wall , thousands of frg citizens ... seized the opportunity to visit the gdr for the first time .
many want to stay .
they're looking for an alternative to ... the hard battle for survival in the capitalistic system .
isn't that wonderful?
not everyone wants to join in with career addiction and aggressive marketing .
not everyone wants to fight his way through life .
such a day , so wonderful like today ...
these people want a different life .
they realize that cars , video recorders and tvs are not everything .
they are ready to realize a new life with nothing but good will , vigour and hope .
amazing .
my mother survived the gdr by 3 days .
i guess it was the right thing , that she never did learn the truth .
she died happily .
she wished for us to scatter her ashes to the four winds .
that's not allowed in germany .
not in the west and not in the east .
but we didn't care .
up there she is floating and maybe she is looking down at us .
and sees us as tiny dots on our little earth .
just like sigmund jhn back then .
the country my mother left was a country she had believed in and which we kept alive until her last second .
a country that in fact never existed like this .
a country that in my memory will always be connected to my mother .
