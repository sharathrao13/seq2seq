nina , the prettiest girls from all the high schools go to l. a.
you know what happens to most of them?
dad , you don't think terri's special?
paul , seriously .
i think she's the most special human being on the planet .
she's my girl .
that's why she's not going to l. a.
she's 16 , for god's sakes .
what's wrong with you people?
hundreds of people apply for this .
if she gets in , it's proof she belongs there , but you get that , right?
look , when i was your age , i thought i knew everything too .
but i've seen a lot more of the world than you have , paul .
what parts of the world have you seen , dad?
the back and front of your dad's restaurant?
okay , okay .
paul , that's enough .
well , just because you're stuck here , you want everyone stuck with you .
you better watch your mouth or you're gonna get grounded .
all right , listen .

i can't believe you sprung me .
this is a first .
well , who know when we'll ever break the law again , right?
i'm not , uh , staying in flagstaff terri .
i lined up a job in phoenix and i'm going straight to arizona state .
i'm not coming back .
just like that?
i mean ...
it's time .
dad and i ... need ...
it's just time .
the only thing i feel bad about is leaving you here .
no .
you don't have to worry about me .
we get along okay .
yeah , that's what worries me .
it's more than getting along , t erri .
you please them .
you're like a stepford daughter out of a mail order magazine .
is that a form of flattery?
after dad slammed you on bristol hillman , you're going to tell me that didn't hurt?
no , it totally hurt .
then make a scene !
break something !
scream !
i ... something .
huh huh .
tantrums were never my thing .
terri , you've got the best voice i've ever heard , but if you hang with the " world according to simon fletcher " any longer , you're going to be doing " cats " at the y at 40 .
and that would suck .
that would suck .
! " home !! " ! " this house is not a home ... !
what's up , flagstaff?
how you guys doing all right?
! " are you ready for this? !
paul , don't oh my god . ! " sit down ! ! " are you ready for this? ! " ! " shut up !! " ! " are you ready for this? ! " ! " stand up !! " ! " are you ready? ! " ! " this game ! " ! " are you ready? !
! " are you ready? !
! " are you ready for this? ! " ! " sit down ! " ! " are you ready for this? ! " ! " shut up ! " ! " are you ready for this? ! " ! " stand straight !! " ! " are you ready? !
paul , look out !
! " are you ready for this? !
oh !
thank god .
paul?
no .
healing nicely .
still got that headache?
can you tell me your birthday?
april 20th .
let's let t erri get the next one .
tell me what month it is .
june .
what's wrong with her?
why can't she speak?
terri , tell me what month it is out loud .
it's june .
that's good .
now follow this light with your eyes .
doc , stop !
whatever you're doing , just stop .
i wish i was older .
i'm so afraid i'll say something stupid and make it worse .
hey , aunt nina .
hi , t erri boo berry .
honey .
why was this in the trash?
you got in .
congratulations .
paul would be so proud of you .
mom , what are you doing?
if paul were here , he would just get in another screaming fight with dad about it .
okay .
everything is different now .
do you still want to go?
i don't want to sing anymore .
i don't believe that , terri .
why don't you let me handle your dad about this .
i think terri should come visit me .
hmm .
simon , i really think she needs to get away and i'd like her to come to palm desert for the month of august .
a month with you , alone in the desert?
are you nuts?
it is alone , isn't it?
i'm between guys right now .
so yes , i'm alone .
yeah , for the moment .
well who's going to help me in the restaurant?
oh , is that really what you want to say , simon?
who's gonna help me with the restaurant?
aunt nina , who said that you could do that?
i've never lied to my father before .
terri , i just think this is your life .
you deserve the chance to live it .
then why does it feel so wrong?
there's something about your dad that i don't think you know .
he and his friend david both got football scholarships to ucla .
really?
and when graduation rolled around , our family restaurant was doing good , but our parents weren't .
neither of us wanted the restaurant , but your dad felt he had no choice but to take it .
and , uh , his friend david went on to ucla .
and he got caught upin the l. a. scene and he's been messed up ever since .
but i know that if your dad had taken that scholarship , he would have made it
so , what does that have to do with me?
i don't know .
everything?
but it's your decision , terri .
he would have wanted you to have this , honey .
paul would have wanted you to have this .
i shouldn't have snuck him out .
oh , honey , it's not your fault ,
i feel so bad all the time .
no .
i can't do this .
i can't go .
i can't lie to dad .
it's just too soon .
honey ...
i will tell dad that you're really not at nina's when the time is right .
and he's gonna be mad at first .
but he's gonna realize it was the right thing to do .
you sure it's the right thing to do?
no .
i'm not sure of anything .
i just want you to be happy .
okay .
i'll do it .
okay .
are you guys gonna be okay?
yeah .
yeah .
we'll be fine .
uh , i'm taking her to the train station .
and , uh , nina will pick her up on the other end .
we'll be fine .
here you go .
this is for you .
dad .
i don't want nina to pay for everything , and uh ...
you wanna come home early , you call us , okay?
okay .
i love you .
me too .
call me , okay?
okay .
i want you to take this .
you just call us whenever you want .
and make sure you conference aunt nina in when you do ,
'cause you know your father , he's gonna want to talk to her every once in a while .
okay?
got it , mom .
i love you .
i love you . ! " lift off , here i am , here i go ! " ! " stand back , i'm in control ! " ! " i'm outta this world , about to take off ! " ! " and when i reach the stars , i still won't stop ! " ! " 'cause i'm about to rocket .... !

hi .
i'm terri , your roommate .
yeah .
denise .
okay , everyone .
take a seat .
let's be seated .
in case you bought that old saw that those who can't do , teach .
these talented musicians beside me are your teachers .
but i'd prefer you to think of them as your guides .
hello , and welcome to bristol hillman's summer music program .
i'd like to start by reminding you of the large number of talented students who applied but did not get in .
now , this summer is not just about learning your craft .
it's about testing your limits experimenting .
new experiences .
it's about building up and rocking the foundation of that which will give you your own individual voice .
now , some basics .
we have a strict 10 : 00 curfew , 1 1 : 00 on the weekends .
possession of banned substances will mean immediate dismissal .
hmm .
this is l. a. , people .
use some common sense .
travel in pairs .
lastly , the scholarship .
three weeks from now , on the last day of the program , we will have final performances where you show us what you've got .
now a lucky student will win a $10, 000 academic scholarship for music study .
that's pretty good , huh?
so , work hard .
have fun .
get lost .
later .
okay .
i gave her three chances .
the chances have come and gone .
send her back where she came from .
i don't care !
people , grab a seat .
my name is mr. torvald .
you are my class and we have three weeks to learn an incredibly complex choral piece .
it ain't ever gonna happen , but let's give it the ol 'college try , shall we?
there are five solos in the ensemble .
only five people will perform solos in front of this class .
and i will hand them outin two weeks based on participation , exercises and je nai sais quoi .
if you're not french , that means ,
ooh !
i will also split you up into groups of four .
yes , i still count on my fingers .
one for each part in the obnoxiously difficult contrapuntal harmony at the end of the book .
this piece is gonna drive you nuts .
but when you nail it , it feels good .
you .
you .
you .
you .
group one !
hey , jay !
nice hook
jump in and pick it up .
hey .
is anybody sitting here?
how many of you can identify this note?
you there .
what is the note?
a " b?
b flat !
the ability to know any note when you hear it is great asset .
those of you who don't have it must work that much harder .
is the same with your ability to read music .
your opportunities are expanded .
if you look at a piece of music , see how the notes are arranged on the page and hear exactly what it is , each note in your head .
this is something you will learn to do this summer in your individual studies with me .
i'm so sorry .
that was me .
are you okay?
yeah , i'm i'm fine .
i'm sorry .
that was my fault .
i was in the way .
no , it's good .
it was my fault .
i should really learn to stand .
okay .
awesome .
she doesn't even know .
hey .
how's it going?
couldn't be better .
should i ask for a single?
am i bothering you that much?
hey .
hold up .
i mean , i just get the feeling that i'm some kinda pain in your butt .
look , it's not even like that , all right?
i'm here for that scholarship .
i'm just about hardcore focus .
well it seems really personal .
oh , please .
i'm not even trying to hear that .
look , we're all up against each other for that money .
so i just gotta be able to do my thing and not get caught up in any personalities .
i don't really mean nothing by it .
so , we cool?
yeah .
we're cool .
cool .
hey , mr. torvald .
hey , robin .
i wanted to let you know that i tried those exercises you gave me last summer and they really helped .
i just wanted to say thank you so much .
my pleasure .
oh , and i'll have you know that i'm gunning for those solos .
well , i'll keep an eye out for you .
thank you , mr. torvald . ! " for the lord god omnipotent reigneth ! " ! " hallelujah , hallelujah ! " ! " hallelujah , hallelujah ! " ! " for the lord god omnipotent reigneth ! " ! " hallelujah , hallelujah . !
ouch and cut .
sorry , that was me .
yeah , we know .
and you are?
terri fletcher .
thought i recognized you .
the girl from the dvd .
terri fletcher , the thing is the theme emerges from the harmony .
give me you hand .
none of you follow it directly .
capice?
good job , robin .
whoo ee !
okay , let's do it again .
one , two , three , four .
! " for the lord god omnipotent reigneth ! " ! " hallelujah , hallelujah , hallelujah . !

! " she she doesn't even know , know , know , know !
thanks anyways .
you're a serious weirdo .
it isn't lucky unless it's face up .
but now it's just a penny that thinks it's lucky , but it isn't .
well now it can be lucky for someone else .
besides , haven't you ever heard of making your own luck?
well , what do you know?
a lucky penny .
so , an englishman in l. a.
yeah , my parents put an ocean between them after the nastiest divorce ever .
no joke , people study it .
so , how can you have a sense of humor about that?
my music became like a religion .
it kept me sane .
so , music is your higher power .
pretty much .
i mean , look at this .
this city .
all these people .
all this life and music .
i'm gonna make music for them .
i can't think of a better way to spend my life .
are you missing home?
a little bit .
i don't know .
it's just been really tough lately .
come on .
i just gave you my " e !
true hollywood story .
you gotta give me something .
um .
me and my brother were in a car accident on the day of his graduation .
and , um , some drunk driver ran through a red light and
hey , terri !
come here .
uh , look , terri , i've gotta go . somebody .
look , say hi to denise for me .
hey .
hey , was that jay running off?
yeah .
figures .
what , was he macking on you?
not that i could tell .
well , count your blessings , 'cause i know his game .
he likes to hit on nice girls .
and baby , you you got a lock on that one .
what?
i mean , look at you .
look at your hair , your clothes , the way you talk .
you're like some kinda retro brady buncher .
shoot , i'm not even trying to hear that .
okay , that was cute .
my bad .
i didn't know you could do t
yeah .
my teachers are always harping about how it's bad for me .
you know , how i'm gonna lose my ear .
but i just like how it sounds in here .
hello .
oh hi , honey .
um , dad wants to talk to you .
um , simon , pick up .
hey , sweetheart .
how's it going?
hanging in there?
yeah , everything's good .
sure do miss you .
i miss you too , dad .
what was that?
sounded like a siren .
uh , no , no .
it's nothing .
well , it didn't sound like nothing .
it sounded pretty close .
the neighbors are out of town and their alarm keeps going off so , i'm gonna go talk to the police , okay?
i'll call you back .
all right , bye .
okay , bye , honey .
uh , what , terri , wait .
terri?
i'm gonna lose it . ! " king of kings ! " ! " forever and ever ! " ! " hallelujah , hallelujah ! " ! " and lord of lords ... ! " ! " forever and ever ! " ! " hallelujah , hallelujah !
yes . ! " king of kings ! " ! " forever and ever ! " ! " hallelujah , hallelujah ! " ! " and lord of lords ... !
i can never get that note .
i can't believe this .
i can .
problem , ladies?
yeah , i think that some of us maybe need to practice this a little bit more outside of class .
meow !
why don't you let me worry about that , hmm?
okay , that's it .
done for the day .
go on .
get outta here .
ms. fletcher .
okay , i give up .
what did you do with the girl on the dvd?
excuse me?
the lively , funny , talented girl , what did you do with her?
i have no idea what you're talking about .
i sent my songs on a cd .
no , there was also a dvd .
it came in late .
we almost didn't see it .
but it's a big part of the reason why you are here .
sit down .
be comfortable .
okay , mr. t orvald .
i did not send it .
i really have no idea what you're talking about .
no?
well .
let me introduce you to one interesting , fascinating lady .
maybe you'll be inspired .
i know we were .
terri's my sister .
and , uh , she's my favorite person in the whole world .
she like a challenge .
she thrives when she's pushed .
and the people who can do that , they don't live in flagstaff .
terri deserves a chance to learn from the best .
she's already good .
but she could be great .
if you let her in , you won't be disappointed .
hey , terri?
terri !
terri .
are you okay?
please .
it's probably just some weirdo misfit thing .
no .
the show's over .
okay , you can go now .
look , whatever it is , you can't leave .
it's copping out .
what are you doing here?
same as everybody else .
the music thing .
ducking a summer job .
i mean here in my doorway .
look , come on .
let's just get outta here .
come on .
let's just go .
the bag isn't walking away .
how do i know you won't?
i was sitting right next to him .
and he died and i didn't .
you know?
and i don't know why .
but i miss him .
the second i start to feel like i'm enjoying myself , this voice comes inside my head and .. it's like , " how can you be having a good time when paul is dead?
you can't blame yourself like that .
you don't understand
it was my fault
i got him to sneak out .
i shouldn't have risked it .
look , t erri .
some idiot ran a red light .
it was bad luck .
messed up timing .
that's all .
you weren't there .
look , i can't imagine what you're going through .
but i do know from experience backing down can become a way of life
don't leave .
screw the pressure .
screw the scholarship .
i mean , do your own thing on your own terms .
and get what you came here for .
that's what counts .
but jay , i'm lying to people .

terri , wait .
i'm sorry , i'm just ... a bit weird when i'm writing .
why?
well ...
i it's just my lyrics .
they're really lame .
i mean , when i sing them .
and i want them to mean so much more , but
well , i've been writing songs since i was a kid .
but my arrangements sound like some cheesy saturday morning cartoon or something .
play something for me .

come on , whatever happened to that ...
you've got to do your own thing on your own terms " junk that you gave me the other day?

are you talking about the girl in the black sweatshirt?
dude , she's the hottest player here .
i heard her in the practice rooms and she's flawless .

i'm fine .
i saw
i just wasn't ready .
i i was gonna wait .
but , um , this is for you .
paul's cross .
good .
nice .
improving .
we've got 10 minutes left .
i want to run the third section .
has anybody seen terri?
i can sing the part , mr. t orvald , i know it backwards and forwards .
it's t erri's solo , so lets wait for her .
but she's not even here .
and it's not like she can sing it anyway .
terri's worked hard for it .
she deserves it .
no , i deserve this part !
stop it .
jeez .
well i guess you have a new favorite now !
whoa , whoa .
what's wrong?
i don't understand .
i don't i don't see how things can just go from being so great one summer to turn to such crap the next .
i'm sorry , robin .
can we talk?
i mean , privately?
hey , mr. t orvald .
i'm sorry i missed class .
well , that's okay .
are you feeling better?
what?
if you missed my class , you must be deathly ill .
it's too bad because we were gonna work on your solo today .
i'm not ready for a solo .
yes , you are .
don't you even know how much you've improved since you've been here?
okay , but there are much better singers here , mr. t orvald
i'll be the judge of that .
we'll try it again tomorrow .
look , terri , there's people in the class who are desperate to do this solo , so if you don't care about the work , what have you been doing here?
this is so humiliating .
you're suppose to be with me .
look , just take it easy .
worse things have happened , right?
yeah , all the time .
just not to me .
i always get my way .
is that a bad thing to say?
well , maybe a little , yeah .
but i thought you liked bad .
maybe a little bad?
come on , we got along really well last summer , didn't we?
people change , robin .
i'm not the same person i was last summer .
neither are you .
i don't know .
i think we can be those two people again .
don't you?
hey , have you seen jay?
uh , heading to the practice room , i think .
i think i know the problem .
i'm bad .
but i can be better .
terri , wait !
terri !
t erri !
terri , wait !
wait .
jerk !
terri !
jay?
stay away from me !
terri !
stupid .
! " i don't know your face ! " ! " no more !
! " or feel the touch ! " ! " that i adore !
! " i don't know your face ! " ! " no more ! " ! " it's just a place ! " ! " i'm looking for ... !
t erri , come on , please .
she doesn't want to talk to you .
just back off .
! " we might as well be living ! " ! " in another town ! " " we might as well ! " ! " we might as well ! " ! " we might as well ! " ! " be strangers ... !
! " be strangers !
! " for all i know ! " ! " of you now !
! " for all i know . !
aw , hey .
you okay?
it's nothing .
i'm sorry if i was hard on you the other day .
i just want you to know that i'm here for you if you need anything .
if you want to talk anything .
okay?
have you ever lost anyone?
yeah
i just can't let this go .
well , you're an artist and artists feel things differently than regular people .
look at patsy cline or billie holiday .
you could hear it in their voice .
or , vincent van gogh cut off his ear , but hey , he could paint .
vincent van gogh killed himself .
that's right .
that's a bad example .
hey , i'm a music teacher , not a shrink .
what do you want?
i guess ... what i'm trying to say is artists convey emotion .
they make an audience feel what they're feeling .
you know , that's what it's all about , right?
you just have to find a way to take what's in here and put it in here .
what the hell .
who is it?
it's jay .
let me in !
go away , you jackass !
no , no , no !
i just please , i just want to talk to terri , okay?
just let me in .
he sounds drunk .
uh , you think?
hey , girl , do not open that door .
okay , i'm gonna make him leave , all right?
jay , you have to leave now .
no !
ow !
that hurt a lot .
shh .
no , it's not what you think .
what's going on? !
i saw you kissing her , okay?
no , no .
you shut up !
come on , terri .
i'm trying to sleep .
sh i wasn't kissing her .
she was she was kissing me .
oh no .
he didn't even try to go there , please .
i'm sure that makes a lot of sense , jay , when you're drunk .
t erri , i don't care about her .
i care about you .
boy , who you trying to play?
terri?
denise , just chill out , all right?
look , terri , i care about you .
you know i do .
why would you do that?
why would you drink?
because , because i'm i'm worthless .
you know what?
don't even try and give me that self pity thing , okay?
terri , look .
y'all need to relocate .
okay , well , i'm never going to get him past the night guard , so you
i'll be fine .

wake up . ! " can you hear it calling? ! " ! " can you feel itin your soul? ! " ! " can you trust this longing !
wake up , it's a new day . ! " and take control? ! " ! " fly ! " ! " open up the part of you ! " ! " 'cause it's your time ! " ! " time to fly ... !
i'm really sorry .

you're not forgiven yet .
come on , let's go .
! " in a moment ! " ! " everything can change . !
frances !

frances?
car keys?
frances?
so i wrote some new lyrics and now all we have to do is practice ,
so we can pull this off .
right .
here's the music .
okay , well , let's start here .
i wanna work on the bridge .
okay .
! " it doesn't matter what people say ! " ! " and it doesn't matter how long it takes ! " ! " believe in yourself and you'll fly !
it's not let's , um , go again and try it a little faster .
okay .
okay . ! " it doesn't !
stop .
okay , for real this time .
let's go .
! " it doesn't matter what people say ! "
it sounded fine the first time .
okay , but " fine " is not going to win us the scholarship .
okay , it's gotta be right . and i'm not gonna give up until i nail it .
it'll drive me nuts .
! " it doesn't matter it doesn't matter ! " ! " it doesn't matter how long it takes ! " ! " believe in yourself and you'll fly high . !

we were losing the only child we have left .
i'm not gonna let that happen .
that's my point .
she's just a child .
she's our child .
and how can i protect her if she's not here?
i want her home .
i want her home now .
will you shut up in here? !
you are the loudest , noisiest , rudest jerk on the planet !
oh , ow !
sorry .
thank you and welcome .
well , it's time to bring things to a close .
it's been great fun and we have even more in store for you .

and i'm sorry about that .
but i did what i had to do .

she doesn't even know !
! " she wants the creature from outer space !
! " time is running out . !
dad ... this place is the scariest , hardest best thing that has everhappened to me , no matter how i got here .
we'll discuss it at home .
i'm not leaving . and i did this for me and i'm gonna finish it for me .
you can take me home if you want to , dad .

all right .
each year we present a $1 0, 000 academic scholarship in music studies to an outstanding student in the summer music program
this year's program was better than most , full of talented , hardworking students .
it's a shame we only have one scholarship to give .
so without further ado , the board of directors of the bristol hillman music conservatory is pleased to present this scholarship to ...
denise gilmore .
oh honey !
you were so wonderful !
oh , thank you !
truly amazing but then again , it's in the genes .
aunt nina , thank you for everything .
