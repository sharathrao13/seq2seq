hello , michael .
i want to play a game .
so far , what you call this your life , you've been living watching other .
the society calls you a informer , a rat , a snitch .
i call you unworthy of the body you posses , of the life that have been given .
now , we will see if you are willing the to look in world better than that , to give up the one thing you rely on in order to go on living .
the device arround your neck is a death mask .
the mask is on a spring timer .
if you do not locate the key in time , the mask will close .
think at this like a carnivorous plant .
what are you looking right now is your own body no more than two hours ago .
don't worry .
you were put to sleep and can't feel a thing .
taking to account that you are a great disadvantage here , i am going to give a hint from where hidden the key .
so listen carefully .
the hint is this : it's right behind your eye !
how much blood you would share to stay alive , michael .
live or die .
it's your choice .
who the fuck are you? !?
somebody help me !!

county's best officials are working on a deadline .
a woman found a body and called us in .
she said that this place is abandoned for about two years , in spite of the people that live down here .
who?
homeless supposely .
a group of boys behind drugs .
it is a good place to prick .
an estimate time of death?
the forensic just got here .
but one of the officers said that was your buddy .
he was not my buddy , it was an informer .
the officer id him just looking at him?
no , he was not possitive , for that wanted you here .

i know that it is still early , but up to now is jigsaw pattern .
i've seen that .
what he want with me?
well , let's just pretend that is somebody new .
can you think at anyone who will do that to your guy?
he was an informer , kerry .

crackheads do not have engineering degree .
i see that the cause of the death it is apparent . ..
and you?

but i will imagine that he is coward in a corner with a look on his face ...
eric , wait !

somebody open the fucking door .
i think nobody's listening .

think that you can wake up in a room without having idea of where you are?
i guess you never been drunk before .
i've been drunk ... three years ago in college . ... that is not drunk .
that is kidnapping .
i watched that movie in tv last week .
this guy was a reporter
it was in that war zone , right?
he will sleep at his hotel room and when he wakes up , he is in a cell , without windows and no light .
and he spend 9 years in that room .
9 years?
that's nothing .
get over it .
what do you mean get over it?
i mean stop bitching about it and let's do something .
i think we should calm down .
shut up .
i heard something .
what is it?
it's ticking .
i hear a ticking .
hey , calm down .
what's your name?
amanda .
where am i?
i don't know .
nobody knows .
we just woke up here , like you .
no !!!!!!
no !
it's ok !
no !!!!
f ** k !
what?
what are you looking for?
what is this?
everything what we need to know is on this .
greetings .
and welcome .
i trust that you all are wondering where you are .
i can assure you that your location it is not important , what this walls offer for you is important .
salvation .
if you earn it , three hours from now the door to this house will open .
but unfortunatelly you have two hours to live .
right now , you are breathing a deadly nerve agent . you've been breathing since you arrived here .
as you are familiar with tokio subway attacks will know it's devastating effects on the the human body .
the only way to overcome it and walk out that door , it is to find the antidote .
somewhere hide arround this house .
one of them is inside that safe in front of you .
you all possess the combination of the safe .
think hard .
the numbers are in the back of your mind .
the clues of the order can be found over the rainbow .
once you will realize what you have in common you will be in better understanding why you are here .
x mark the spot of the clue .
so , look carefully .
let the game begin .
who is this?
what did you mean?
how did you know where to find this?
that is bullshit .
do not attempt to use this key on the door to this room .
fuck his rulles .
yeah , fuck this .
that's a good idea .
no , no , this is not a good idea .
so what will gonna do?
will sit here?
the note said not to use the key .
who does give a shit about the note?
this all is a fucking big bad joke .
and i'm about to end it .
better start to talk right now .
what is this?
it's a game .
ain't no fucking game .
his face was just blown out .
he is testing us .
who is testing us?
jigsaw .
who the hell is jigsaw?
do you read the fucking news?
no , who is he?
he is a serial killer .
no , is not .
he is testing us .
he wants us to survive this but we have to play by the fucking rules .
i will ask again , how does that know all this?
because i've played before .
the tactics team is coming now to discover where the video come .
what do you want from me?
a little of your time , detective .
i don't have time .
you asked me when i want and i told you .
believe me when i tell you , your son is in a lot of troule .
if i'll give a litile of my time , what then?
i just want to talk to you .
everyone else must leave .
those are my conditions .
no , it's a crime scene .
nobody leaves .
they don't have to leave the building , they just have to live this area
long enough for me to talk with you .
if agree to with that , then you will see your son again .
if i don't see more my son again , i swear to god , i'll rip your fucking head off .
i don't intend to mock you , officer , but i'm cancer patient .
have could you possibly put me in anymore pain than i'm already in?
just get them here now .
tag team is on the way .
they will discover from where the video comes
in one hour , maybe two .
consider that he wants to talk with him alone .
then maybe should talk with him .
well fuck that .
five minutes , old school method .
he's not gona respond to force , you know that .
don't underestimate my methods .
i have been working in that in case since the first day .
i have spending all the ways to get the pieces together .
maybe that's why you don't have a family for yourself and you don't understand this man what's going through .
look ...
no , no , don't talk with me .
listen , you already lost your son sometime before because of me .
this won't happen again .
that is bullshit .
what we're gonna do?
just deal with him .
buy us more time .
you can win this erik .
you can beat him .
... to find the antidote .
there are several dispersed in the house .
one of them is inside of the safe in front to you .
all you have the combination for the safe .
think hard .
the numbers are behind your mind .
they think enough .
the numbers they are behind their minds .
the clues for the order can be ...
shit .
hey , wait for a little .
where you going?
i'm gona find an antidote and i'll get out rom here .
antidote?
face , you were already in the joint .
you talk with owner of the chamber you know that is no antidote for that shit .
look at this .
the doors are locked .
did you hear that?
it is wood .
plaster .
it is not a fortress .
it is a fucking house .
i am only saying let's just take our time and come with a game plan .
well , you'll came up with a game plan?
all right?
now i'm going out of here .
look .
you ok?
yes , i'm fine .
i won't do that if i're you !
you don't know what behind that fucking door .
fuck .
shit .
they leave the room .
ok?
let's talk .
sit down eric .
i want to play a game .
the rules are simple .
what you have to do is sit here and to talk with me .
listen to me .
because for the enough time you will find your son in a safe and secure state .
we didn't go properly introduced .
my name is john .
how you like to be called jigsaw .
no ...
they were the police and the press that created that name jigsaw .
i never ecuraged to claim that .
the jigsaw piece that i cut for my subjects was more to be a symbol that at that subject was missing something , a vital piece of the human puzzle : the survival instinct .
this is all really , really interesting , john .
right now i really want you to talk with me ...
i am talking to you .
you are not listening .
don't forget the rules .
i am listening to you .
and all of this is the same sick fucking bullshit that come from you every two seconds in each interrogation that i ever did to all fucking people .
it is an interesting approach to placemarkus .
you didn't suppose to convinceing me that
i'm your friend?
to lead me in a false sense of security to confide me in you?
it is difficult to follow the manual when you have my son , john .
the manual?
what i'm doing to you right now?
what would have made five years ago?
would you have followed the manual?
would you broken my jaw with a flashlight?
you seem to know a lot about me .
i know you once considered a fearless policeman .
do you fell a lot much safer now , that you only seat behind the desk?
i am feeling a lot of things right now .
but you feel alive , that's what you fell .
and that's what you want .
kindly ... get me a glass of water?
i would very much appreciate this .
fuck .
well we estabiles that the macho bullshit ain't gona open the door , .. any more suggestions?
look who is talking .
the only door you know to open is between your legs .
shut the hell up , all right?
you shut the hell up !
imbecile ...
the hell is ...
ok , nobody take shit from nobody .
we estabilish that .
did you find anything?
no , nothing .
that tattoo , is joliete .
right?
yeah , so?
i did get restrain in there myself .
are you proud?
and you , what is your corectional facility of your choice?
what is your point?
my point is , you were not like that durring the highschool , right?
that make 3 of us that done time .
i think we should concentrate more on that tape cause that tape said , we have more in common that we know .
i said , the three of us ......
hey !
i found a door over here .
i need a flashlight .
over there .
fuck .
oh , shit !!
ei !
damm , kid .
sorry .
what the fuck is obl?
obi , is my name .
hello obi , i want to play a game .
per years you have burnt those arround you enough lies and deceipts .
now you have a chance to redeem your soul for the games what you played for the other .
for playing one of mine .
inside of the equipment there are two antidotes for the poison that runs in your veins .
one is a present of mine for helping me to kidnap the other ones .
the second is yours to donate .
however , one of them will have a price .
remembers that : once you are in hell , only the devil can help you .
wait a minute , what's that mean?
to kidnap the others .
it was him that put us here .
the car ... it was ...
i knew that i knew him .
you were the last person that i saw before i wake up here .
you did this .
are you sure is him?
it better be sure .
i am sure .
you've done the same .
i did what i had to be done .
i will give you a choice .
you have 5 seconds to get us out of here .
i don't know the way out .
bullshit .
you put us in here , you get us out from here .
no , i can't .
then you are dead .
sorry .
no , wait .
listen to me .
we got two antidotes in that oven .
we are wasting time here .
wasting time?
are you kiddin 'me?
he kidnapp me in the middle of the night .
we know even know what is in those syringes .
do you want to stick yourself to find out?
yeah .
anyway , who will get them? ...
right now , you go in there or i kill where you stay .
if you will threat me with a knife , at least to cut me a little .
i guss i'll go in there to get those needles .
if i'll get one .
one for me .
hurry up .
come on , man !
guys can pray for this one .
thank you , hommie .
here we go .
what the fuck is happening?
open the door .
open the door .
it is locked .
open the door .
open the fucking door .
come on , get him out of there .
the door !
i will try .
i don't get to open .
come out of there .
use your coat .
use your fucking coat .
come on .
open the door .
stop that .
come on !
stop it !
it's a window here .
he has the antidote .
stop that .
remove him then .
stop that !!
hang on man , will get you out .
stop it , stop it ...
stop that ...
yo , fuck away .
move , move !!
shit !
the needles .
he lost the needles .
i want the fucking needles !!
calm down .
fuck ! .
the needles are fucking hot .
he had a choice .
another one down , kerry .
how much time will time lose with that bastard?
we are not wasting time , we are doing what should do .
didn't look like this to me !
you see , detective , the darwin theory of the evolution , the survival of the more fort , based on his little trip to galapagos is no longer applied on this planet .
we have human race to test the edge or will to survive .
what the fuck do you want?
i'm trying to remain calm , isn't it?
and your son is walking arround on those monitors .
i cannot give what you want if i don't know what the fuck it is .
you know what it is .
just remember the rules .
no , you said you want to talk .
then you said that you want to play a game .
you are talking , but it means nothing .
what is the cure for the cancer , erik?
what?
the cure for the cancer .
what is it?
i don't know what is . but i know is not to kill and to torture people for your sick fucking pleasure .
i never murdered nobody in my life .
the decision are up to them .
well , to put a gun to someone head and force him to pull the gun it is still murder .
since when the use of force solve a problem of your?
why you're so desperate to get your son back?
'cause he is my son .
when was the last time when you said to him that you love him?
well , then go !
seems to me that closing son's death is causing you to act .
when is your willing to do that when a life is at stake?
i always loved my son , that's never changed .
mmm , it's changed now .
the knowledge of the death changes everything .
if i will tell you the exact date and time of your own death , it will shut your world completely .
i know .
can you imagine what is fell like to have someone sit you down ...
john cramer? .. and tell you that you are dying?
the gravity of that?
that the clock is ticking for you .
in one second , the world is crack open .
you look at things differently , you smell things differently .
you savor everything , either a glass of water or a walk in the park .
the clock is ticking , john .
most people have the luxury not knowing when that clock will go off .
and the irony of that is that keeps for really living their lives .
it keep them drinking that glass of water but not really tasting it .
you can still fix that , john .
yeah , but you can fix you?
i'm not fixable .
i have cancer .
you think that the cancer is an excuse for what you done?
no .
the cancer is all what started me and my work .
it was the moment i decided to end my life , and start a new with my work .
that brought meaning to it .
i literally , driving myself to suicide .
i failed .
my body is not strong enough to fight cancerous cells .
than i have lived for a plundge of ...
and for my amazement , i was alive .
and i was determined to spend the rest of my days testing the fabric of human nature .
do you understand , erik?
you have the chance to do something right now , john .
just tell where my son is .
i will help you .
i don't need your help , and i can tell you that you stil don't understand .
those who don't appreciate life , do not deserve life .
my son appreciate his life .
but do you appreciate yours?
do appreciate your son's?
bullshit !
don't forget the rules .
will help to find your son .
where are you?
no , we don't have 15 minutes .
we need that location to the video feed .
hey , we should stop , ok?
ok?
it is the second time when i wake up in this shithole .
can you stand up?
yeah . but only if i want to .
it's still so much things to do .
so many people have to talk to me .
this can be it .
it's not .
amanda , you said that you survive this , right?
do what?
this guy .
whatever is he doing ... you said that you played before .
you survived .
yeah .
so , we can survive .
yeah .
amanda , why you defend him?
because i was a fucking junkie .
but the funny is , i pass the little test .
if you passed the test , why you are back here?
i was mean with myself .
how long has been ...
i started in jail .
what were arrested for?
possesion .
but , if i said that ...
maybe you should talk with the cop who arrested me .
i guess you were never been arrested before .
no .
i've been in trouble few times , you know , and some other stuff .
my father is the ...
he is a real hard ass .
he probably is right now looking for me , just to kick my ass for dissapereance .
yeah , probably .
we found a door .
come on .
come on .
we have to go .
it the only one without a lock , but we can't get it open .
how's going?
it's stuck in some thing .
here , let me try it .
come on !
take it easy .
back up , allright?
if is stuck , it's a trap .
man , the whole house is a trap .
somebody doesn't want us in that room .
now what?
i will make it back , ok?
what else will do?
we got 3 minutes to get it done .
hello xavier , i want to play a game .
the game i want to play is very similar with what you give that played as a drug dealer .
the game of offering hope to the desperate for a price .
i think we can agree that your situation is desperate .
so i offer you hope .
the price you to pay is that you must crawl in the same pit you force yours customers into .
by entering this room , a timer has been started
when the time expired , the door in front of you will be locked forever .
guys !
you must have find the key before that the time runs out .
can you unlocked , with the dreams that are locked inside?
i will give you just one hint that's where the key is .
it will be as finding a needle in the heist .
let the game begin .
somebody is going there .
nobody is fucking going in there ...
no , no ...
you are sick ..
what are you doing? !
stop , nooo !!
put her down !
help me !!
shit !
oh my god .
come on .
we don't have time .
o , shit .
'the fuck is wrong with you?
what are you doing?
you are fucking mind !
hurry up .
keep going .
we don't have time .
keep fucking looking .
come on !
fuck you !
somebody help her . 'the fuck , guys?
no , no , nooooo ! ....
come on .
fuck .
that's enough .
that's no nealry enough .
ahh , stop that bullsit .
did you hear that tape?
he knows about us , our names .
there is something that we are not seeing .
yeah .
you said you three you been there .
make it 4 .
for what?
does it matter?
anybody else?
what about you?
you got juvenile written all over you .
no , never been .
all right .
let's talk this out anymore .
no more talking .
the only thing you people haveing in common is holding me back .
i'm out .
where is that damm tactical team?
will be here any second .
i'm not listening to this any more .
another second is to fucking long .
i know how this guy works , ok?
he is playing a game .
that mean we have to stay a little bit longer .
take a look at the clock .
you need something for that box , or his son will end up in one .
his work .
he want to get done , that's how he's doing .
he wants to be heard , to be studied .
right , destroy his work .
how will get your conviction without all those evidence , eric?
don't mean a shit , big deal .
so go ahead , destroy it .
i will !
just knows will not save your son if you do it .
you kill my son , i kill you .
oh , yeah?
we both know what sort of person you are .
that sort of person that gun down an unarmed suspect .
the sort of person who plants evidence in order to obtain a conviction .
that sort of person that is abandoned by the wife and hated by his son .
shut the fuck up !
he said he found a trace through satellite .
your tag team has arrived .
just in time .
we right now found the source of that video .
somebody haven't told you , eric .
i tired listening to you .
maybe i can just show it to you .
unfortunately , it be difficult for me to get it myself , so you perhaps could ask the people who are listening to that walkie that he can get it for me .
brown desk .
second drawer .
you may not remember all those people .
but i am sure they remembers you .
you were the arresting officer of all they cases .
and you were the one who plant all the evidence used to obtain their convection .
you are the one who put them away .
your son is playing a game with a lot of people that don't like you very much , detective .
it will be a shame that they discover who he was?
you all possess the combination for the safe .
think hard .
the numbers are in the back of your mind .
the clue of the order can be found , over the rainbow .
bitch .
what are you doing?
i haven't decide yet .
you know , the others are scared of you .
good .
you and me ... we keep going on each other like back in the yard , or we can come together and figure out who is doing that to us .
you and others do what you want .
i already found what the fuck to do .
you remind me of me .
you don't know what kind of fuck up situation you in , you have to find yourself a enemy .
you know want?
i've got enemies .
outside these fucking walls , bro .
and they are looking for me .
and if they will not find me , they go after those close to me .
my family .
you understand?
no , i don't understand .
it's just me , and that's the way i like it .
now , turn around .
what?
turn around .
you son ...
oh , shit .
no , we can't stop .
we've been here for two hour .
if is what's said true , then we got one hour and that front door will open .
we won't gona make it that long .
possible winning that's usual .
she know what is talking about .
oh , yeah?
x mark the spot .
