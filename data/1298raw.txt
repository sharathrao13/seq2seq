no more lies .
i'm sure you're all wondering ... what the cops and
first , we owed some money , and then we saw something ... and we've been hiding for a while , pretending to be something that we're not .
hey , who saw <i>yentl? </ i>
so barbra streisand wants to study the <i>talmud, </ i> right?
but , she can't because she's a woman , so she pretends to be a man , and , uh , one thing leads to the next , and before you know it
uh everybody everybody believes that she's a man .
so she has to keep lying even though she wants to stop , she can't ,
'cause she has to keep lying to people that she cares about .
you know , that have been really kind .
look , uh , we're women .
no , you don't get it .
we're women .
oh ho ho .
oh ho ho .
we're sorry we lied .
so sorry .
