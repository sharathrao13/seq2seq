how did he know about the money?
and how did he know that tony cisco got popped?
we didn't find out about it till this morning .
i don't know .
it was peezee .
gotta be .
he hates your fucking guts .
i don't know .
what is so hard to understand here?
you said peezee was a mamaluke and couldn't be trusted .
now all of a sudden you got a soft spot for this guy .
i just don't think it was him .
okay , i'll buy it .
if not peezee , then who?
who?
tell me .
i think it was you , ducks .
you gotta be kidding .
caesar?
caesar , you know me .
what kind of fucking idiot would i have to be to try that with you?
a dead fucking idiot .
come on , caesar .
caesar .
caesar !
this is garbage .
change the channel .
okay , paul .
no .
hey !
what are you doing , asshole?
sorry , mr. vitti .
didn't mean any disrespect .
oh , man .
forget about it .
punks .
let them watch what they want .
i'm going to bed .
good night , paul .
good night .
all right , what do youse wanna watch?
little caesar !
all right , all right .
step out .
hey , earl , what's up?
they're transferring me .
did you ask to be transferred?
not me .
what's up?
i don't know .
anyway , thanks for looking out for me , paul .
i'll see you around .
sure .
isaac sobel was a man of rigorous belief and unflinching honesty .
a patriarch with an almost biblical sense of integrity and conviction .
a man of faith and courage , of spirit and humor .
a rock and a tree .
a good friend who will be deeply missed .
i'd like to call on isaac's son , dr. ben sobel , who would like to say a few words .
it's not easy for me to talk about my father ... ... because , in a sense , i'm talking about two people .
one is the public isaac sobel ... ... the eminent psychotherapist ... ... and popular author known to millions of readers across the world .
the second is the private man .
my father .
dad .
and for those of you who knew him well ... ... and know our family , well , i don't have to tell you .
he was a psychotic , mind fucking prick .
an arrogant , ego inflated son of a bitch .
i wish you were alive so i could kill you .
rot in hell !
now i'd like to call on isaac's son , dr. ben sobel ... ... who would like to say a few words .
who the hell would have a cell phone in here?
it's yours .
answer it before they notice .
hello?
guess who , you fuck?
i have to take this .
what?
i'm sorry .
it's mine .
i have to take this .
yes?
i left three fucking messages .
you don't call me back?
this is not a good time .
not a good time?
let me explain something , i'm in fucking hell right now .
this is not a good time .
this is a very bad time .
my father died .
get off .
i have to go .
don't you hang up on me , you ...
call back .
they're trying to kill me .
hey , fredo .
yeah , you , guido .
come over here .
i've got something to show you .
you're a dead man .
385 , mess hall .
thanks , lorenzo .
thank you .
i can't believe he's gone .
i can't believe what you said .
cold and withholding "?
you had to tell everybody?
why didn't you take a swing at the casket?
i might have strayed from my notes a little bit .
i'm grieving .
it's a big loss , and grief is a process .
mr. and mrs. sobel , your housekeeper let us in .
i'm agent miller , this is special agent cerrone .
federal bureau of investigation .
we'd like to ask you a few questions .
can i ask what this is about?
we've just come from a funeral .
we know this is a difficult time for you .
it will only take a minute .
sure , sit down .
sorry about your father .
thank you very much .
it's very , very difficult .
i'm gonna miss him terribly .
i mean , there were issues , like there are in any father and son relationship .
he wasn't a very warm man .
ben .
yeah?
once today .
enough .
okay .
no , i'm just saying that even so , he was a ... ... great , great legs ...
man .
dr. sobel , you received a call this morning from paul vitti .
why would you say that i got a call from paul vitti?
because we monitor all his phone calls from sing sing .
then , yes , i did .
that was him?
on the phone?
yes .
why didn't you tell me?
well , talk about withholding .
michael .
you told her at the drop of a hat .
well , she's in the fbl .
she needs to know this information .
okay , i see , and i don't .
i don't need to know these things .
no , don't tell laura .
she can't possibly handle a phone call .
did i say that?
did i say that?
you folks need a minute?
no , we're fine .
yeah , we're phenomenal .
listen , i'm gonna go to the kitchen .
pants suit .
she's grieving .
you know , it's a process .
vitti?
we were involved in some organized crime activity a few years ago .
i mean , i wasn't , you know , " involved .
he was involved .
but i was treating him therapeutically at the time ... ... and then some people tried to kill us .
it was really nothing .
shortly after you two spoke , he seemed to have some kind of breakdown .
really?
what kind of breakdown?
i think you had better go up there and see for yourself .
i'm treating him with thorazine .
300 milligrams , b . i . d .
seems to keep him pretty calm .
that would keep the middle east pretty calm .
and he just keeps singing west side story songs?
tonight . " " maria . " the balcony scene .
you should get him to do " officer krupke .
it's really good .
paul?
maria?
paul , it's me .
dr. sobel .
maria?
tony?
maria !
oh , maria !
oh , my god !
thank god you've come !
yes .
you've got to get me out of here !
okay .
do you promise?
i promise .
te adoro .
te adoro .
this is how it's been .
he sings for a while , then he goes completely catatonic .
and you did a neurological workup?
yeah .
no tumors , no seizures , no sign of stroke .
paul?
if you're faking , paul , i'm gonna know .
when i was a resident , we used to play with the catatonics .
well , i don't think he's faking .
i don't think he's smart enough .
street smart , yeah ... ... but we're talking about an iq just north of a bedroom slipper .
so if he is truly ... ... catatonic , if i stuck him with this needle ...
this is just plain saline , isn't it?
yeah .
yeah .
then he shouldn't feel a thing .
right?
that's gotta hurt .
no reaction at all .
i want to do some neuropsychological testing , okay?
sure .
paul , i'm gonna give you some tests to assess your mental condition , okay?
now , do i have your consent to share the results of the tests?
mommy is mad at me because i made a boom on the rug .
i'm gonna take that as a yes .
good .
okay .
paul , i have 10 cards , each with a picture of an inkblot on it , okay?
here's the first card .
now look at it , and tell me what you see .
i see a bat .
a bat or a weasel .
a bat or a weasel?
yeah .
bat .
bat weasel .
do you see anything else?
just a pussy with teeth .
pussy with teeth .
yeah .
next card .
excellent , paul .
one hour and 12 minutes .
i want you to take a look at this picture and tell me what's happening .
i think we got a picture of a guy , nice , hardworking fella .
comes home , sees his wife is in bed with a midget ... ... and she's been fucking him while he's out of town .
so she's having intercourse ...?
with a midget .
very good .
it doesn't matter who they know downtown .
tell them they got no leverage .
mr. chapin?
come in .
come in .
all right .
hi , i'm dr. ben sobel .
hi .
thanks for coming in .
i appreciate it .
my pleasure .
so , what have we got?
okay ...
based on his symptoms and his test results , i would call it brief psychotic disorder ... ... and if it persists , schizophreniform disorder .
and dr. kassam , the psychiatrist at sing sing , concurs with the diagnosis .
so he's crazy .
not crazy .
no .
at least not permanently .
see , in certain people , prolonged exposure to extremely stressful situations ... ... like soldiers in combat , for instance , or disaster victims or hostages ... ... can produce a temporary psychotic state .
how temporary?
a day , a week , a month ... ... if the precipitating stresses are removed .
which means he's not gonna get better as long as he's in the can .
he could conceivably get worse .
right now he thinks somebody is trying to kill him .
and he could deteriorate to the point where he's permanently schizophrenic .
then he's got a real problem .
he goes before the parole board in four weeks .
would they actually release him?
oh , yeah .
i'm sure they'll want to release a major mafia figure ... ... who's now certifiably deranged on top of it .
why don't they release him to a halfway house ... ... or a center where he can get the care he needs?
based on my earlier work with him , i don't think he's dangerous ... ... and i think he's making a strong effort to reform himself .
okay ... ... i'll tell you what i'm gonna do .
i'm gonna release him into your custody .
mine?
oh , no .
no , i couldn't ...
no .
no .
no .
mr. chapin , thank you , anyway , but this is a very bad time for me .
see , my father just died .
i'm sorry .
and i'm grieving .
it's a process .
and i have a bulging disk in my neck .
and i have this burning sensation when i urinate ...
yeah , i've had that too .
we're redecorating , which is a nightmare .
you wanna see him killed in prison?
no .
or sent to a facility for the criminally insane?
of course not .
then he's all yours .
i told my son we couldn't have a dog .
i'm gonna bring home paul vitti?
i'm gonna talk to the bureau of prisons ... ... and get you certified as a temporary federal institution .
i can't be an institution .
i work in the suburbs .
i handle neurotic soccer moms and alcoholic gentiles ...
you have got 30 days to get him into shape for his parole hearing .
that means sane , sober and gainfully employed .
now i'm warning you , doctor .
if he screws up in any way , if he flees ... ... or if i find out this was a setup to get him on the street ... ... i will hold you totally responsible .
and you will pay dearly .
you'll be stripped of your license and prosecuted to the full extent of the law .
are we clear?
yes .
do you want him or not?
yes .
good choice .
we'll be in touch .
tony .
hi , how are you?
you okay?
doctor , sign here and here , please .
okay .
okay , thank you very much .
you fucking piece of shit !
i tell you someone is trying to kill me and you hang up on me? !
i knew it .
i knew it !
you faked !
you stuck me with a fucking needle !
you used me to get you out of prison .
it took you long enough .
i'm singing west side story for three days .
i'm half a fag already .
what were you doing?
i was in a funeral home !
what's that got to do with somebody trying to kill me?
you're my doctor !
my father died .
so?
with you , it's always , " me , me , me .
he's dead , so get over it .
that's life .
are you hearing this?
are you hearing you?
i'm deeply sorry for your loss , okay?
yeah , i can see how touched you are .
all right .
who's after you?
you tell me .
could be my old crew , could be the rigazzis , lou the wrench .
lou the wrench?
why " the wrench "?
the guy's a maniac .
he twisted some guy's head off once .
off?
off .
totally off .
the feds are putting pressure on everybody .
all the families are fighting each other .
it's like the fall of the roman empire .
wwill .
what does this have to do with you?
they knew i was getting out .
the last thing they want to do is see me get into it .
just explain to them that you're out of it now and you're starting a new life .
that's a really imaginative thought .
i wish i could have thought of that .
maybe they'd throw a party and give me a gold watch .
what , are you kidding me?
believe me , nobody's happy that i'm getting out .
nobody .
wanna grab your stuff?
no .
jelly's gonna pick me up in an hour .
i don't think you understand .
you're in my custody .
you stay here .
therapy every day .
you can't leave without permission .
you gotta be kidding me .
are you coming in , or do i have to make a phone call?
some fucking life this is gonna be .
get my bags .
do you really think he's crazy?
don't you wanna get a second opinion?
if he thinks i think he's crazy , he's crazier than i think he is .
locked up , he's of absolutely no use to us .
but back on the street , vitti has enough juice to be a threat to both families .
it's like throwing gasoline on a fire .
that's if he goes back to his old life .
people like paul vitti don't change .
he's been a menace to society since he was 12 years old .
being a criminal is all he knows .
he's gonna head straight back for trouble .
then all we have to do is sit back and pick up the pieces .
we need to stay on vitti .
how could you?
how could you bring him here?
that mobster in my house , eating off of my dishes .
it's not like i had a lot of choice .
it's a new law?
you have to bring home a gangster?
he's in my custody .
i am a temporary federal institution .
why couldn't he just go home?
because his wife and his family are in ohio .
sure , yeah , everybody gets to go to ohio except me .
you wanna go to ohio?
that's not the ...
shut up !
his life was threatened .
he didn't want to endanger his family .
how thoughtful .
but it's okay to endanger our family?
i know this is a terrible imposition , but it's not like i wanted him here .
well , you didn't want him , and i didn't want him , but here he is .
here he is .
hey , you .
coffee?
what?
somebody said something about coffee .
yeah , that was you .
you said you wanted some .
so , what's the holdup?
ben , why don't you make your friend some coffee .
i'm gonna take a long bath .
and hopefully drown .
excuse her , usually she is a wonderful hostess ... ... but she's grieving .
it's a process .
hey , doc , listen .
i got a friend coming over , so i don't want you to be surprised .
what kind of friend?
because if it's the wrench , or the pliers ...
no , it's a personal thing , you know?
oh , yeah?
they won't be staying late , will they?
are you that fucking pussy whipped?
i'm not ...
this has nothing to do with laura .
i just heard her busting your balls .
we were having a disagreement , yes .
but some conflict is normal in a marriage .
or?
or what?
you're pussy whipped .
paul , i am not ...
when the coffee's ready , i'll be upstairs .
good night , whippy .
forty minutes .
how long are you gonna let them go on?
let them?
how much longer can they go on?
another five minutes , i'll break it up or i'll call the guinness book of records .
oh , god .
oh , god .
give me a break .
she's faking .
what?
nobody sounds like that .
oh , yeah .
oh , god .
oh , god !
come on , nobody sounds like that .
i don't know .
" i don't know .
yeah?
paul , i have to talk to you .
what's up?
i have to talk to you .
talk later?
now .
hold on .
yeah?
i have a 17 year old son .
i'll ask her .
that's not what i'm talking about .
i need to speak to you .
actually , i'm right in the middle of somebody .
can't you see?
paul , now .
and , miss , there's no smoking in my house .
thank you .
okay , paul , what do you think you're doing?
minding my own business , like you should be doing .
that's difficult to do with the vagina monologues in the guest room .
i been in the can for two and a half years .
what am i supposed to do?
go to a hotel .
that's what i wanted .
you told me i can't .
you said it's either here or sing sing .
i'm not trying to punish you , but i do have some responsibilities .
i thought you might appreciate a nice home cooked meal after being in prison .
yeah , that's what i've been jerking off to for the last 850 nights in a row .
a fucking home cooked meal .
tuna casserole !
all right , paul?
doc?
the girl's gotta go .
the girl?
you know , i bet you're jealous .
yes , i'm very ...
and what might i be jealous of?
i didn't hear nothing out of your room .
we don't think it's necessary to wake the neighbors every time we have sex .
if you're quiet , you could do it without even waking your wife .
paul , that is not funny .
what is that?
i told her if i wasn't back in two minutes to start without me .
i gotta go .
this is not a good start .
it was for me till you knocked on my door .
here , aunt esther .
thank you .
and again , i'm so sorry we had to put you up at a hotel .
we would've loved to have you stay with us , but we had an unexpected houseguest .
his father always had room for us .
don't say that to me .
shut up .
you go to hell !
i am so out of here !
go on , get out of here , you fucking pain in the ass !
you crazy pain in the ass !
get the fuck out of here !
go ahead , go back to turning tricks in hoboken , you pain in the ass !
how's it going?
food .
paul?
paul , what are you doing?
hey , doc .
i'm just looking for something to eat over here .
this all you got?
who do you have to fuck to get some bacon around here?
not you , i hope .
he's new in town .
let's go in the office , i'll make you a plate .
what's in the office?
we're gonna go to the office and talk first .
hey , doc , what's up with your family?
they tend to overreact a little .
i know .
all you did was flash everybody in the dining room .
by the look of some of them broads , they ain't seen the old salsicc 'for a long time .
it's good for them .
good for them?
well , when the paramedics revive my aunt golda , i'll be sure to ask her , okay?
sit down .
so ...
paul , do you mind?
i think we've seen enough of the old salsicc 'for one day .
thank you .
so , what are you gonna do , paul?
i'm gonna find out who's trying to kill me .
i'm a target .
they could shoot through that window and blow my fucking head off .
then what?
so i gotta deal with that .
that would be a priority , i understand that .
i'm talking about a job , work .
there's gotta be something that you like to do .
i like hitting guys over the head with a baseball bat .
that's good .
so sporting goods .
yeah , exactly .
that's interesting .
so who are you?
who am i?
i just wanna know how you see yourself .
i'm paul vitti .
i'm the boss .
the boss of what?
the boss of jelly?
because you're not the boss of me .
so , what are you the boss of?
i see what you're doing , you .
i see .
i get it .
what am i doing?
you're pissing me off .
that's what .
look at me .
i'm starting to get anxious .
it's very understandable that you're anxious .
i mean , you spent your whole life becoming something that you were ... ... and now you can't be that anymore , so it's scary .
i mean , if you're not paul vitti " the boss , " who are you?
let me ask you this way .
when you were a kid , what did you want to be?
i was a kid .
who remembers that shit?
but you had to want to be something .
did you want to be a baseball player?
no .
a fireman?
an astronaut .
come on , what did you wanna be?
it was stupid .
it's not stupid .
what , are you afraid to tell me?
yeah , i'm afraid .
so tell me .
i'm not here to judge you .
what did you want to be?
there was one time when i was about ... ... maybe 6 , 6 and a half , 7 .
right in there .
right in that time .
i thought that i wanted to be a ...
i wanted to be a ...
for a second ...
you know , a little kid .
what?
maybe ...
i was a kid , you know?
little kid .
what?
tell me .
i wanted to be a cowboy .
a cowboy , really?
would you believe that?
well , that's interesting .
how did that start?
i was watching television with my mother , father .
you know , we watched those cowboy shows .
and my ...
my father got me the whole outfit .
he got me a 10 gallon white hat ... ... the boots , the spurs , the cap guns ... ... the whole bit .
then he took me upstate to my uncle's farm and led me around on this little pony .
and there was cows and all that stuff .
it was like , to me , the wild west .
and it was all " yippee kai ay " and all that stuff .
you happy now?
so , what happened?
i don't know .
what happened?
why didn't you try to be a cowboy?
i was in east harlem .
i joined a street gang when i was 12 years old .
why didn't i become a cowboy?
something else happened when you were 12 that was very difficult for you .
yeah .
that's when your father was murdered .
yeah , i think about it every day .
what's that got to do with anything?
it has a lot to do with things .
it's very interesting because your father was the one who got you the white hat .
he was in the mob , but yet he wanted you to be a hero .
yeah , he did .
your father wanted you to have a better life than he did .
he did , yeah .
he wanted me to go to college .
i didn't even go to high school , hardly .
that's because he had died and he wasn't around to guide you .
see , paul , before , you said , " i'm paul vitti , the boss " ... ... but when i look at you , i see paul vitti the 12 year old kid ... ... who's scared and confused with a lot of hard choices to make .
you .
you .
you're good , you .
no , paul ...
no , you're good .
you're better than good .
it's just the beginning .
you're real good .
you made me realize i'm a little fucking kid .
that's all i wanted .
i never could figure it out with my father .
that's great .
but you have to ...
it's clear now .
new choices , new things .
new beginnings .
i'm ready .
i'm here , front and center .
let's go .
there's somebody that i work with .
he's a career counselor .
he places people in jobs .
he's excellent .
i'm ready .
sign me up .
i'm ready to go .
i'm ready to jump in with both feet .
that's great .
i'm ready !
down !
that was not a good thing .
hi , doc .
jelly , what are you doing here?
hey , doc .
it's been a while .
i thought you were in prison .
it would appear not .
well , how did you get out?
i had a new trial .
it turns out the evidence in my first trial was , you know , tainted .
i see .
anyway , two of the witnesses decided not to testify , and the third guy ... ... he committed suicide .
how?
he stabbed himself in the back four times and threw himself off a bridge .
very unfortunate .
good to have you back .
we're in a war , paul .
it's not safe out there .
the rigazzis are walking all over us .
we need you , paul .
you know , sally , i'm out of it .
it's over for me .
i don't do this no more .
the family needs you .
what are you talking about?
no one did the big jobs like you .
air france , they're still talking about it .
paul , think about it .
for me?
i'll think about it .
okay .
come on , what is this?
a fucking funeral?
you just got out of college , for chrissakes .
let's have a party .
i'll have one drink , and then i gotta go see the boss .
yeah , what?
" yeah , what?
that's how you answer the door , you?
yeah , what?
you got a problem with that?
yeah , what?
don't bother getting up on our account .
paul , what a nice surprise .
yeah , patti , how's it going?
it's good .
come here , you .
give me a kiss .
get over here .
come on , what did i do?
what did i do that you're mad at me?
come on .
how are you , paul?
all right .
you missed a spot .
you can't be too careful .
hey , i know .
sorry to hear about carmine .
he was a good man .
yeah , i know .
you live with someone for 21 years .
then one day they pull his torso out of the river .
it's hard .
yeah , i'll bet .
especially since the talk was that you were the one that put him there .
that's why i try not to gossip .
it's ugly .
yeah , it is .
just a sec .
michelle , theresa , it's 10 : 30 .
stop fucking around and get ready for ballet !
it's so hard being a single parent and a career woman .
for instance , a lot of people are saying now that you're out ... ... that you're gonna try and take the family from me .
i said , " no , paul would never do that to me .
never .
not me .
good .
so you look good .
what , have you been working out?
yeah , i been working out who's been trying to kill me .
got any ideas?
it's a dog eat dog world out there .
and you know nobody will be safe unless we end this thing with the rigazzis .
so you had nothing to do with it?
paul , calm down , okay?
i did not try and kill you .
all right?
look , i want us to be friends , you know?
who knows?
maybe we'll be more than friends .
you wanna lick my beaters?
patti , let's get serious .
i wanna be left alone , okay?
i'm not doing anything , i'm just taking care of my own self ... ... which is what i should always be doing , and that's it .
sure , i understand , okay?
you understand?
i do .
i understand .
relax .
sit down , i'll make you a cup of coffee .
no , i gotta go .
i got a business thing with some guy .
if you get something going , we'd expect some kind of consideration .
a little taste .
no , this is a legitimate thing .
it's different .
you gave me a chill .
yeah , well , you'll get over it .
give me a kiss .
come on , give me a kiss , you .
take care of yourself , huh?
you too .
all right .
don't be a stranger , paul .
yeah , i'll see you around .
watch him like a hawk .
it would break my heart , but if he steps out of line , shoot him in the fucking head .
it'll be my pleasure .
look at the size of that trunk .
you could put three bodies in there .
just kidding .
just trying to levitate the situation .
okay , thank you .
we appreciate it .
sure .
hey , what kind of car youse drive , anyway?
it's a lexus 430 ls .
that's like a toyota .
it's a lexus .
yeah , toyota , lexus , same thing .
japanese , right?
let's not forget pearl harbor .
anyway , let's get serious .
you wanna buy this car , or what?
we have to think about it .
what's to think about?
you told me you liked it .
you asked me 10, 000 questions .
i answered every one .
you drove it .
you love it .
what more do you need to know?
you know , it's a lot of money , and we need time to consider it .
consider it?
why don't you consider this .
you been breaking my balls for an hour ... ... asking me about every goddamn accessory in this car .
what about the light?
you cannot talk to customers like that .
you're not a customer as far as i'm concerned .
you want to buy the car or not?
not from you .
i wanna see the manager .
you wanna see the manager?
i'll show you the manager .
here's the manager .

hey , he just said it .
he's the boss .
so tell me , how was your first day?
good .
good .
good .
that's great , paul .
that's great .
did you sell any cars?
almost .
6 : 45 , okay .
paul , thanks for everything .
we have been waiting here 20 minutes .
i only got two hands , left and right .
i can slap you with either one .
now get out of here .
you're a pain in the ass .
come on .
mr. torre .
mr. torre .
let him through .
hey , paul .
glad you're out .
how are you?
my son michael .
hey , michael , nice to meet you .
i wanted to ask you something .
yeah?
you think the yankees are gonna go all the way?
we'll do our best .
it would be very important to me personally .
very important .
try .
i'll talk to the team .
go eat .
joe , good to see you .
welcome back .
thank you , charlie .
hey , paul .
hey , joey .
how are you?
i heard you was out .
yeah , well , you know ...
the table for six isn't ready .
i'm gonna take the four now .
when mr. arnold comes in bring him right back .
so , what are you doing?
you working here?
you know , i'm on parole .
i gotta be a good boy , you know?
i got a piece of the joint .
so , what am i going to do?
i gotta ...
i get it .
we're gonna have a drink at the bar .
all right , okay .
i'll see you , joe .
nice to meet you .
big smiles , everybody .
thanks , paul .
appreciate it .
hey , can you get us a pelligrino , round of drinks ... ... and more bread when you get a chance?
thanks .
you want more bread?
yeah .
bread .
there you go .
i'll get your drinks now .
this stone is supposed to be a g color .
it looks a little yellow , doesn't it?
that's the fluorescent light .
it makes everything look yellow .
no , i thought fluorescent light makes everything look blue .
what am i , edison?
that's a fuck ...
it's the fluorescent light doing that .
that's a g.
well , maybe .
look from that angle .
what do you think?
i don't ...
i don't know .
it's a little ...
yeah .
could we look at it with a lens?
that might help us out .
do you have a lens?
we just asked for a lens .
where do you think you're going?
where am i going?
the orphanage found my real parents .
i'm going to jelly's house .
no , you're not .
you're in my custody .
and we have therapy to do .
for what?
the more we talk , the worse i get .
look at me .
i'm a fucking wreck .
i had that dream again .
the one where you're mussolini?
no , the other one .
you know , i'm 16 , you're freud .
and then i'm scared out of my mind ... ... and these giants are coming at me with guns .
and i'm fighting them off .
too bad .
the limp sword dream?
yeah .
i probably shouldn't be listening to this .
well , then don't .
paul?
sorry .
let's talk about it .
and you don't think this dream is sexual?
you're thinking the sword is my cock , i can't get it up .
that ain't it .
because i was with sheila last night , i had a hard on you could swing from .
i don't need to know that .
you could hang wet towels on this one .
congratulations .
it's a nice thing to have .
he's built like a racehorse in that area .
thank you .
i get it .
i've seen it .
hey , wait in the car , you .
so , what does it mean?
sex can mean a lot of things .
i think , in this case , it's about performance anxiety .
you're under a lot of pressure .
you're changing your life , you're trying to find a job that fits you .
doc , nothing is gonna fit though .
this 9 to 5 bullshit?
forget about it .
i'll fucking kill myself .
you know they take taxes out of your paycheck?
what the fuck is that?
like , i'm doomed .
i'll wind up selling hot dogs on the street .
take a deep breath , paul .
i mean , my heart's beating like a rabbit !
just relax .
you're hyperventilating .
that's all it is .
here , breathe into this bag .
and breathe in and then breathe out .
in , out .
this is your fault .
excuse me?
this is all your fault .
my fault?
you tell me to get a job like i'm a fucking nobody .
it's humiliating .
really?
is it?
you know what , i'm doing the best that i can .
all right?
if it's not appreciated , or if my best isn't good enough for you ... ... then find somebody else to talk to , you selfish son of a bitch !
because i didn't ask to be born !
what the hell is that about?
i'm sorry .
i'm grieving .
it's a process .
all right , i'm the patient .
that's enough .
now what are you taking?
echinacea , goldenseal .
immune system .
there's a lot of plants and ticks .
okay .
do you know the television show little caesar?
yeah , i know it .
the producer of the show is a man named raoul berman .
a mutual friend told him i know you , so mr. berman called me this morning ... ... and said that he would like to meet you .
for what?
i don't know .
why don't you meet him and find out?
we just got him out of our house .
now we're having dinner with him?
that's not very professional , is it?
it's social .
he's meeting a television producer who could give him a job .
he's very nervous about it , and he asked me to buffer .
i'm here to buffer .
he's a grown man .
why does he need a chaperone?
he doesn't .
he needs a buffer .
that's me .
i'm here in a buffering capacity .
if you say " buffer " one more time ...
331 , they're all inside .
we're gonna go eat something .
we'll be back before they finish dinner .
didn't you just take two of those?
did i?
no , that was the other ...
the chinese herb enzyme thing .
this is different .
just don't drink anything .
drink?
honey , i'm a doctor , i know what i'm doing .
i adore this place .
it is the best sushi in town .
yeah , it smells good .
did you try the yellowtail , paul?
they got any real food around here?
i mean , this is like eating fucking bait .
raoul , what's very interesting about paul is that he was born without a filter .
he has no filter .
he says whatever comes through his mind .
he never edits himself .
what's with you?
what do you mean?
you sound like a fucking retard .
i took a pill .
i took an ibuprofen pill .
i probably shouldn't have had the mai tai or the sake .
it interacted , and it's giving me a little problem with my upper lip .
that's all .
it will be gone in about an hour .
will you shut the fuck up?
see that?
he just told me to shut the fuck up !
i love it !
i absolutely love it .
in two seconds , i'm gonna stick this fork in your fucking eye .
he will stick a fucking fork in my eye !
what did i tell you?
unfiltered .
could i get another one of these , please?
me too .
i'd like a cosmopolitan .
no .
no .
no .
why not?
the buffer has had too much .
okay .
mr. berman , i love your show .
thank you .
and anthony bella , the guy that plays nicky caesar?
he grew up in bensonhurst , right next door to my cousin's friend's husband .
i hate to bust your bubble , but there's no way he's from bensonhurst .
he's , like , a professional italian from connecticut or someplace .
listen , paul , i have to ask , would you be interested in working on little caesar ... ... as a consultant and technical advisor , you know , coaching the actors?
making sure the dialogue rings true .
yeah , whatever .
oh , my god !
this is so exciting !
fantastic !
how about a toast?
a toast to paul and little caesar .
down !
that restaurant was really good .
i liked it up until the attempted whacking .
now , is that the right terminology , mafia shrink?
sorry .
do you know that you were muttering and drooling like one of your relatives tonight?
what are those pills?
what are you taking?
you know , at this point , anything i can get my hands on .
okay?
because i am staring into a big hole that i can't fill up .
you don't need this .
you don't need this paul vitti thing in your life right now .
especially not right now .
i think you need to be grieving for your father .
you know , it's just , i'm finding the whole thing just a little confusing .
you know , i became a therapist ... ... because he was a therapist .
i mean , it was that easy .
because his approval was so important to me .
i mean , it was everything .
and i never really got it .
so now i'm thinking , is this ...?
is this the reason i did it?
and now that he's gone , do i still wanna do this?
because i don't know .
come here , baby .
i just want you to be happy .
hey , pal .
i'll ask you once .
who are you working for?
i'm working for your mother .
fuck you .
fuck me?
yeah .
no , no , no , wait , wait !
stop !
wait !
wait !
stop !
who are you working for?
get me up !
stop !
get me up !
drop him .
i'm working for lou the wrench .
rigazzi .
the wrench?
yeah , the wrench .
how do you spell his name?
i don't know how to spell it .
r i z a z z ...
can't even spell his fucking name right , you fucking moron .
pull him up .
what's the matter with you?
you said drop him .
i said pull him back up .
that ain't what i heard .
then you heard what you wanted to hear .
i guess you got me there .
what the hell happened to you?
vitti threw me off a roof .
vitti?
you talked to vitti?
yeah , i talked to vitti .
what did you say to him?
nothing .
you sure you didn't tell him anything?
i didn't say anything , mr. rigazzi .
can i go now?
i think my leg's broken .
that must hurt , huh?
wait a minute .
i have something for that .
i hate to see people in pain .
get him out of here .
what about vitti?
he's a hard man to kill .
but he's not immortal .
our time will come .
okay , roll film .
background .
hey , i like my sausage burnt .
i don't know how you like your sausage?
i been doing this 20 fucking years .
you got the money?
i almost got it .
i'm still light 15 large .
but don't worry about it , i got it covered .
all i gotta ...
all i gotta ...
cut !
cut !
can you do something about the goddamn smoke?
cut !
can you do something about the damn smoke?
this is the trouble with shooting on location ... ... although it's worth it for the authenticity .
well , it looks authentic .
hey , tony !
tony .
anthony bella , nicky caesar .
this is paul vitti .
you don't have to tell me who he is .
it's a pleasure to meet you , mate .
hey , mate .
i don't believe this .
an english guy .
you ain't even italian .
australian italian .
there's a lot of paisans down under .
down under what?
you like to laugh , don't you?
it's a nervous defense mechanism .
i don't have to do it if it bothers you .
so i'll just ...
so , paul , are you gonna join us?
i'm thinking i might .
i like the whole setup here .
sensational , mate .
i can't wait to work with you .
i got a lot of questions for you .
all right , mate .
all right .
can we get this fucking shot?
yes , yes .
paul , thank you .
and welcome .
welcome aboard .
couple of things .
i don't know who makes these decisions ... ... but there are things that i see that don't look right .
yes , i sensed this myself .
which elements strike you as wrong?
well , the people , mainly .
i mean , you got a boss who speaks australian .
what the fuck is that about?
not my first choice .
and your background is what?
theater , mostly .
that figures .
i got some people i could bring around ... ... that will add a certain authenticity to the whole thing .
i would be eternally grateful to you if you could .
is there anything else that you would need?
i'd like one of those trailers like the stars got .
done !
done !
i am gonna go put that in the works right now .
right .
brian !
hey , paul .
you really gonna do this?
yeah , i'm really gonna do this .
are you out of your fucking mind?
i'm going nuts already with this job thing .
in a week , i'll fucking kill this raoul or i'll kill myself .
this is just a good cover till i figure out what i'm gonna do .
but call the guys .
you know , there's a line here .
yeah , it's in back of me .
take the chicken and the two pastas .
you must be a teamster .
youse don't stop eating .
tell me why i'd give a shit about your wife's cousin?
no , no good .
it's not good?
what about this line?
stevie wonder sees more shit than you do !
no .
never .
it's not good?
never .
how much does the chosen snitch want for this?
no?
no .
it's no good .
no good .
jesus .
that's it .
that's ...
that's the end of the scene .
there's no dialogue in the scene .
you're better off .
get in the car .
we going to the prom?
shut up and get in the car .
i know .
sit down .
careful .
the eggs are on the bottom .
oh , yeah?
yeah .

i'm sorry , i don't discuss my patients 'cases with anyone .
discuss it .
he's suffering from a chronic anxiety , and ...
and what?
antisocial personality disorder .
sociopathy .
i'm getting a fucking headache here .
what are you trying to say?
he has a criminal temperament .
he's a criminal?
this is news?
and for that you need a doctor degree?
what do you do for him?
i try to get him to see the possibility of change .
wrong .
you do not want him to change .
that's mrs. lopresti .
patti .
patti , i'm ben sobel .
paul vitti is very important to this family .
we don't want to see you turning him into a stromboni .
stromboni?
the thing they clean the ice with at the hockey games?
that's a zamboni , asshole .
stromboni .
it's a bull with his balls cut off .
no , we don't want to see that happen .
not unless you want to be one too .
no , i'm very attached to my balls .
as you can probably tell .
then do the right thing .
understand?
yes .
yes , i do .
goodbye .
no hard feelings .
no , and probably never again .
we're gonna need a grapple or a crane .
fifty foot boom , at least .
i seen one in bayonne , but i'll call around .
all right , see what you can do .
and we're gonna need a city bus .
anybody got ideas about that?
i got a guy in the transit authority .
he owes me big .
let me know when you want me to call .
hello , paul .
hey .
how you doing?
hi , guys .

this is a closed set .
we're about to start shooting .
yeah?
so am i. let's walk .
come on .
i heard you had some more trouble .
yeah , lou the wrench took a shot at me .
i don't have to tell you , paul .
alone on the streets , you don't stand a chance .
that's what the family is all about .
since the old days when the grandfathers first came over .
it's not something you walk away from .
when you're a jet , you're a jet all the way .
what?
nothing .
so you wanna tell me what's going on?
i see you have your whole crew back together .
nothing's going on .
they're actors now .
don't bullshit me , paul .
i know you're planning something , and i'm feeling left out .
all right .
all right , i'll tell you .
something's going down .
you'll get your end .
just let us do what we gotta do .
it'll be fine .
okay?
you're a good friend .
i would never insist on something like this ... ... but i'd feel better if you'd bring eddie and a couple of my guys in ... ... you know , to help you with the job .
eddie " yeah , what?
he's a good man .
he's a fucking jerk off .
he's young .
he's got a lot to learn .
what is this , crime school?
this is a serious thing we're doing here .
check him out .
talk to frankie brush .
talk to jackie the jew .
he's worked jobs with them before .
they'll vouch for him .
paul , please .
for me .
he does what i tell him , stays out of the way , and he keeps his fucking mouth shut .
all right .
fine .
thanks , paul .
i really appreciate this .
oh , god .
dear god .
look , sweetheart ...
sweetheart , first of all ... ... we're not shooting the hooker scene until tomorrow .
and the hair , please , what is it?

raoul .

hey , lou .
this is lou rigazzi , lou the wrench .
the wrench?
brian?
sorry .

come on , i wanna talk to you .
the guy who shot at you , he was acting on his own .
i never gave the order .
yeah?
he's been taken care of .
there won't be another incident .
unless you're thinking of working for patti lo .
me?
no .
good .
then i got no beef with you .
good , i can sleep better .
let me tell you , because that's not the way to go .
you wanna back a winner , which is gonna be me , okay?
it only makes sense .
so you come work for me .
i'll treat you right .
no , thanks .
so much for sleeping better .
you be careful .
listen , jelly , you just pick numbers .
you know why?
it's an open race .
jelly .
hey , doc !
how you doing?
how you doing?
how are you?
how are you , yo yo?
mo mo .
mo mo , right .
i was thinking of the cellist .
jelly , where's paul?
he's in his camper .
yeah .
doc , what are you doing here?
what am i doing here?
what are you doing here?
i came to tell you that you had a meeting with your parole officer , and who do i see?
patti lopresti !
patti who?
stop lying to me .
your whole gang is here .
who says i'm lying?
i finally get a straight job , i start getting my life together ... ... and you start accusing me?
that's how much you trust me?
paul , it's not that i don't trust you .
it's just that i don't trust you .
this is what's so hard about being an ex con .
you make one mistake and nobody lets you forget it .
so now you're the victim?
paul , i want the truth .
wait a second .
say that again .
say what?
what you just said .
i want the truth .
i want the truth .
no , strong , like before .
paul , i want the truth !
that's it .
that's good .
what?
i'm serious , that had power .
i believed you .
you could be an actor .
paul , i am not an actor .
you're better than the bums here .
there's this part you could do .
i can't .
we have this meeting .
we're shooting now .
there's this part , you could do it .
i'm telling you , it's you .
i did do music man in high school .
people thought i was quite good .
jelly , what are you ...?
help !
help !
hey , help me !
i don't wanna do this !
does that screaming sound real to you?
yeah , that sounds pretty real to me .
that was not funny at all .
there was no harness .
they could've dropped me .
if you didn't wanna do it , you should've said .
you said a scene on the roof .
i didn't know they would throw me off .
they didn't throw you off .
they hung you over the side .
that's it .
i know what you're doing .
you're upset that i have custody of you ... ... so you passive aggressively make me look like a fool .
come on .
you were great .
you were great .
second take , i thought , was better than the first .
jelly wasn't giving me much , honestly .
so i ...
screw you , paul .
oh , boy .
oh , boy .
that's it .
okay .
what are you doing , self medicating again?
no .
don't give me that decongestant , multivitamin shit .
come on , what are you doing?
ginkgo biloba .
helps my memory ... ... and i forget what else .
but don't worry about me .
worry about what you're gonna say to this parole officer .
i mean , what are you gonna tell him?
that you left my house?
that you got your gang back together?
and for what?
a high school dropout reunion?
you recognize that car?
which car?
the one that's been following us for the last few miles .
that?
oh , yeah .
i know that car .
that's a mercedes s500 .
that is one sweet machine .
it's an eight bore .
it comes in a 12 , which is a beast .
lose them .
what?
lose them .
what?
lose them !
lose that car?
you can't ...
i'm gonna stop , paul .
this could be the fbl .
the fbi is two cars back .
you gotta be more observant .
left .
i'm pulling over .
they won't shoot us .
it's daylight .
broad daylight is the best time .
they can see better .
right !
we gotta stop .
this is a lease .
hey , it's a goddamn lease !
move over .
i'll drive .
move over where?
get in the back seat .
back seat !
damn seat belt .
get over !
buckle up , doc .
it's gonna get worse?
it ain't gonna get better .
stop it !
oh , my god .
you think they'll get out?
yeah , that's james bond and that sea hunt guy , so they got a good shot .
i feel bad .
where are you going?
i gotta take care of this .
paul , your parole officer ...
send him my regards .
paul , i'm warning you .
if you leave now ...
so long , doc .
that's it .
you're on your own now , pal .
that's it .
i'm done .
i'm ... ... screwed .
so where is he , doctor?
i wish i knew .
considering i released him into your custody , that's not quite the answer i was looking for .
he's got something in the works .
care to tell me what you know?
i don't know anything .
i really feel he's making an effort to go straight .
oh , yeah?
yes .
that's why we got two corpses in the bottom of the river?
here .
vitti with sal masiello .
vitti with patti lopresti .
vitti with eddie devol .
let me know .
i can order you some wallet size .
i am giving you 24 hours to find him and deliver him to me .
otherwise , you're looking at obstruction of justice and accessory to manslaughter .
can i go?
sure , but you can't take your car .
we're impounding it as evidence .
can i get a ride?
have a nice day .
i don't got a lot of time .
they're probably gonna come looking for me , so we'll go over everything at the club .
paul , not that i'm questioning or anything , but what do we need with this eddie devol?
the guy is like a petty larceny scumbag .
hey , i ain't happy about it either .
but if he keeps patti off my back , so be it .
yeah?
mr. vitti?
mr. bella asked to meet you in makeup .
can't .
gotta go .
it's important .
i'll talk to him tomorrow .
here , here .
tell him you never saw me , okay?
paul , excellent , mate .
come here , please .
i can't talk right now , mate .
i've gotta ask you a question .
two seconds?
come on .
i gotta ...
come on .
can we do it later?
please .
it's important .
paul , i'm looking for something to do when my character finds out he's being indicted .
and i was thinking of punching the wall .
but i did that when they killed uncle lenny , and i punched a car ... ... actually , it was a van , when peezee screwed up the big drug deal .
so i'm looking for something different this time .
something that doesn't involve , you know , punching anything .
kick something .
let me know how it works out .
i gotta go .
paul , wait .
that's really interesting .
kick what?
i don't know .
like , kick a guy in the face .
who?
anybody , just some guy .
knock him down , give him a couple shots in the head and walk away .
why?
why not?
you're pissed , he's there .
i got friends waiting for me .
my character wouldn't do that .
what else you got?
i don't know .
you could yell real loud .
yell real loud?
that's really original .
shut your fucking mouth .
i don't care what you do .
i gotta go .
shut your fucking mouth .
i don't care what you do .
i gotta go .
what'd you say?
what'd you say?
wait .
what are you doing?
wait .
what are you doing?

a quick resolution to last night's spectacular armored car hijacking .
fbi agents , acting on a tip from an unnamed source ... ... raided the rigazzi plumbing company early this morning ... ... and recovered the 50 gold bars stolen in the daring robbery .
arrested in the raid were reputed crime family boss louis " the wrench " rigazzi ... ... and 11 other high ranking rigazzi family associates .
the rest of the stolen bullion was recovered at the crime scene ... ... along with three high flying hijackers apparently stranded ...
organized crime has been dealt a serious blow ... ... and i'm happy to report to the people of new york and to the entire nation ... ... that this great city is today a safer place to live and work .
