a young mexican girl .
pregnant , infected with alds , totally strung out .
she was truly one of the doomed .
i asked her to come in off the ledge and into my arms .
she asked me why she should bother living .
what did you say?
i was trained to tell her lots of things .
her dreams , all the people who'd miss her .
but for a second , i hesitated .
and she saw it .
within that second , i couldn't think of one optimistic thing to say to her .
so she spread her arms and jumped .
i started getting headaches ... ... and eventually started blacking out .
so i filed for medical .

timothy !
timothy !
an insanity plea was refused by the court ... ... despite the fact that my client is a certifiable axis iv dissociative .
to this day , he remains unaware of the crimes for which he was convicted .
in 1986 , the supreme court ruled decisively that states cannot execute ... ... a person who does not understand why he's being put to death .
he signed a confession .
he didn't just sign it , he dictated it .
thirdly ... ... malcolm's diaries found misfiled in state evidence .
your honor , this notebook contains entries made just before the murders .
important to note are the spectacular changes in handwriting style ... ... tone , point of view .
what you are looking at are the private thoughts of several different people .
with permission , dr. mallick will elaborate .
thank you .
your honor , there is no universally efficacious treatment ... ... for dissociative identity disorder .
in theory , one attempts to move the patient towards integration .
a folding of their fractured psyche .
your honor?
he's here .
no !
what you saw was an accident !
he ran out in front of me !
i'm not a murderer !
there's a dead body in your freezer , larry .
i didn't kill him .
i found him like that .
stop it !
listen !
listen !
i was in vegas last month and i lost everything , okay?
everything !
i drove west .
i didn't know where to go , but i was running on empty ... ... so i pulled in here at this place .
and there was no one at the station , so i came over to the office ... ... and i walked in .
and there , sitting at that desk right there , was the manager ... ... facedown in a banquet potpie .
dead !
heart attack or something .
banquet potpie !
he'd been sitting there for god knows how long .
all of a sudden , this auto parts salesman pulls up , looking for a room .
i didn't have a fucking dime ... ... so i took his 30 and gave him one .
i just took the key from the wall and gave him a room .
maybe that was wrong , but i was broke , and that's what i did .
then i came back in here ... ... and i moved larry's body his name was larry too .
i put him in the freezer .
i wasn't trying to hide him .
it was hot out .
i thought it was the best place for him till his family or someone came along .
only no one did ... ... except more guests .
so i checked them in too .
and they all seemed happy ... ... so i just stayed .
cry me a river .
this is a total crock of shit !
no , it's not !
admit it , you killed him !
just like you killed my con .
just like you killed her husband .
just like you killed his actress .
just admit it .
say it , " i killed them .
stop it !
he can't take any more !
everything is okay now .
everything is fine .
we got the guy .
it's fine .
i don't know what we got .
what?
we thought we got the guy two hours ago , then
you believe this shit?
it's him !
it's this guy !
he had a knife to your neck , remember?
his story's so unbelievable , i think it just might be true .
she's got a point .
you guys are crazy .
maybe it's the burial ground .
what?
read the brochure in there .
it's all around us .
a hundred years ago , the government moved these indians here .
they all died because there was no water .
now they're coming back to life like sea monkeys , huh?
come on .
give me a break , sweetheart .
just take it easy , rhodes .
you know , you take it easy !
you've tried to run this show all night .
giving orders , pointing fingers !
you blamed my con for everything , and he ends up dead .
i'm telling you , it's him !
we all saw him run down george .
your actress's wallet is right there .
she's dead , there's the wallet .
what more do you want?
stop it !
please shut up !
all right .
you want a plan?
here's the plan , okay?
no one's gonna move .
we'll stay here , like this , in this room until dawn .
no one leaves , no one moves .
and if he tries anything , i'm gonna shoot him !
and if something out there comes in here , i'll shoot it !
and if anyone of us tries anything , i'll shoot them !
we get it .
good !
timmy?
timmy?
you need to stay in here with us .
it's all right .
remember that movie where the 10 strangers went to an island ... ... and then they all died one by one ... ... and then it turned out they weren't strangers , they all had a connection?
they all messed with the wrong guy , and he was getting revenge .
shut up !
i'm just saying maybe there's a connection between all of us .
like what?
we're all in nevada .
shut up !

when i was going up the stairs i met a man who wasn't there
he wasn't there again today
i wish i wish he'd go away
who is this?
who am i speaking to right now?
where did you learn that poem?
who am i speaking to?
look at me .
who am i speaking to right now?
doc?
edward?
what's happening?
please be quiet .
he can hear what we're saying?
of course i can hear what you're fucking saying .
edward , you missed your last appointment .
where have you been?
did i black out again?
try and think back .
where have you been?
all right .
i was driving this actress ... ... and we got stuck at the motel .
there was a storm .
we couldn't get out because of the storm .
what happened at the motel?
people started dying .
and then their bodies it didn't make any sense .
they disappeared .
edward , i'd like to show something to you , if i may .
do you recognize this man?
no .
that man , edward , is malcolm rivers .
he's had a very troubled life .
he was arrested four years ago ... ... and convicted of the murder of six people in a violent rampage .
he did this .
detective , please .
edward , listen to me .
when faced with an intense trauma , a child's mind may fracture ... ... creating disassociated identities .
that's exactly what happened to malcolm rivers .
he developed a condition that is commonly known ... ... as multiple personality syndrome .
why are you telling me this?
because you , edward ... ... are one of his personalities .
what?
jesus christ !
what the fuck did you do to my face?
keep calm .
where is my face?
that is your face .
why am i tied up?
keep calm .
where is?
please .
jesus christ !
where is my face?
stay calm .
no !
i'm not gonna stay calm !
why am i tied up like this?
who are all these people?
what happened at the motel?
where is everybody?
they don't exist , edward .
you were all created by malcolm as a child .
you're a liar !
consider what you know .
everyone named after a state .
no .
everyone sharing the same birthday .
your blackouts .
no !
i was a cop !
i was a cop in the rampart division of l. a. p. d. for six years .
edward , please .
i live in hollywood , in a studio apartment .
you don't live there .
i do live there !
you don't live anywhere .
i know this is difficult to accept , but the face you saw in that mirror ... ... is the face i've always seen when i talk to edward or paris or larry ... ... or anyone else you've met tonight .
malcolm is in the midst of a medical treatment .
one which forces all his identities to confront one another for the first time .
i knew there would be violence ... ... and with it , the number of the identities would be reduced .
reduced?
one of the personalities you've met tonight , edward ... ... committed those murders four years ago .
he took control of malcolm's body , as you have now ... ... and released an unspeakable rage .
and in 19 hours ... ... malcolm rivers will be put to death because of those actions ... ... unless i can convince that man ... ... that the killer is gone .
i need you to stay with me .
edward?
i need your help .
i need your help to finish this .
edward , listen to me .
edward , stay with me .
listen to me .
i need you to understand .
the killer cannot survive .
edward !
got it?
i can't see a thing .
is there a flashlight?
hang on .
hang on .
you got a flashlight?
yeah , yeah , it's dead .
goddamn it .
shut up !
hey .
what am i supposed to wear , man?
you're in it .
larry .
larry , come here .
ed !

stay with me .

one , two , three .
you gotta help me get you up .
ed , you gotta push a little bit .
ed , why won't you let me help you?
where did you go before?
what did you see?
tell me what you saw .
i saw you .
i saw you in an orange grove .
why won't you let me help you?
where did you go?
what did you see?
i saw you ... ... in an orange grove .
the question , your honor , is whether to convict the body or the mind .
his body committed these murders , that is true .
the person who remains inside did not .
judge taylor , that may not be true
we witnessed the destruction of 10 identities tonight .
nine were innocent and one was guilty .
they're not real !
the violence that existed in him has been executed .
your honor , malcolm belongs in a state hospital .
in the matter of rivers v. nevada , it is the recommendation of this court ... ... that mr. rivers 'execution be stayed .
i am transferring mr. rivers to state psychiatric services ... ... under the care of dr. mallick .
cracked heels and washed out horns blow into my face with scorn
but it's not that way i wasn't born to lose you
i want you
i want you
i want you so bad
timmy .
no , please don't .
no , timmy , please .
what is it , malcolm?
malcolm?
whores don't get a second chance .
when i was going up the stairs
i met a man who wasn't there
he wasn't there again today
i wish i wish he'd go away
