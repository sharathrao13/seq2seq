what is it that makes a man a man?
is it his origins , the way things start?
or is it something else , something harder to describe?
for me , it all began in 1944 .
classified mission off the coast of scotland .
the nazis were desperate .
combining science and black magic ... ... they intended to upset the balance of the war .
i was 28 , already a paranormal advisor to president roosevelt .
i could never have suspected that what would transpire that night ... ... would not only affect the course of history ... ... but change my life forever .
all right , men , let's go .
move !
come on !
come on !
come on !
let's fan it out .
your men ... ... they'll need these .
are you a catholic?
yes .
among other things .
but that's hardly the point .
well , you're gonna need one of these .
i abhor the use of violence .
thank you .
i wouldn't want you to think me mad , sergeant whitman .
no , three days too late for that , professor broom .
all right , you guys , let's move , move , move , move !
this way !

you're wasting our time .
there's nothing here but sheep and rocks .
ruins , not rocks .
hold it right here !
the remains of trondham abbey , built on an intersection of ley lines ... ... the boundaries between our world and the others
what a load of crap !
hell , a week ago , i never even heard the word " parabnormal .
paranormal .

sweet jesus .
they must be here for the sheep .
the freak in the gas mask ...

llsa !
grigori !

the fhrer doesn't look kindly on failure .
there will be no failure , general .
i promised herr hitler a miracle .
i'll deliver one .
what i will do tonight can never be undone !
the seven gods of chaos !
our enemies will be destroyed !
and from the ashes ... ... a new eden will arise .
get down !
i was taking a picture .
you do that again and i'll carve you a new one .
listen , the portal is open .
do you understand?
we have to stop them .
go !
go !
go !
go !
look out !
get down !
it's almost over .
no , it's not .
the portal's been open for too long .
something may have come through .
have your men search the area thoroughly .
spread out over that way !
sir !
something up here !
he's gone .
for now .
when you said something came through ...
from where?
i don't see them !
do you really , really believe in hell?
there is a place , a dark place ... ... where ancient evil slumbers and waits to return .
grigori gave us a glance tonight .
grigori?
that's russian , right?
grigori efimovich rasputin .
rasputin?
come on !
occult adviser to the romanovs .
in 1916 , at a dinner in his honor ... ... he was poisoned , shot , stabbed , clubbed ... ... castrated and finally drowned .
and yet , we saw him here tonight .
professor broom .
careful .
be careful .
what the hell is that?
an ape?
no .
it was red .
bright red .
lower your light , you're scaring it .
what are you two shooting at?
a red ape !

it's a boy .
it's just a baby boy .
move to the left .
there we were , an unready father for an unwanted child .
the boys gave him a name that very night .
in retrospect , perhaps not the most fortunate .
but nevertheless , a name we all came to use .
we called him hellboy .
look at the birdie .
speculation about the origins ...
evidence that hellboy ...
so , what is it exactly that you say this agency does?
i kid you not .
it hunts monsters .
the claim , of course , that this creature ... ... works for the fbl as a monster hunter .
what you seek is in there .
this is a sacred place .
give me my gold .
we shouldn't be here .
master .
have you told him yet?
no .
we should .
i'll notify his family .
he has no family .
according to this file , he does .
he has a son .
hurry up !
hurry up !
wait right here !
tom manning is the head of special operations at the fbl .
he joins pat in the studio tonight to go over the latest hellboy sighting .
there .
that's the tail .
and these are the horns .
i have a question .
in the pictures of aliens , ufo , the yeti , hellboy ... ... why is it they're always out of focus?
why don't you tell us ... ... about the bureau of paranormal research and defense?
i wanna tell you , i wanna tell the american public one thing .

abe loves them .
how does he know so much about me?
abe possesses a unique frontal lobe .
unique . " that's a word you'll hear frequently around here .
sir , where am i , exactly?
in the absence of light , darkness prevails .
there are things that go bump in the night , agent myers .
make no mistake about that .
and we are the ones who bump back .
1937 , hitler joins the thule society ... ... a group of german aristocrats obsessed with the occult .
1938 , he acquired the spear of longinus ... ... which pierced the side of christ .
he who holds it becomes invincible .
hitler's power increases tenfold .
1943 , president roosevelt decides to fight back .
the bureau of paranormal research and defense is born .
1958 , the occult wars finally come to an end ... ... with the death of adolf hitler .
1945 , you mean .
hitler died in '45 .
did he , now?
myers , this is agent clay .
take his lead .
he'll make the introductions .
you're not coming?

they never get the eyes right .
hellboy .

a large entity , type 5 , reported .
very aggressive .
six guards dead .
i thought we checked this place .
fakes and reproductions .
apparently , not everything was fake .
father .
the entity is still in there .
video surveillance shows a 16th century statue was destroyed .
st. dionysius the areopagite .
who wards off demons .
exactly .
the statue , however , was hollow .
a reliquary .
a prison .
the vatican deemed its occupant dangerous enough ... ... to include it on the list of avignon , of which , by the way , we hold a copy .
perfect job for these babies .

holy water , clove leaf , silver shavings , white oak .

for each one of you that falls ... ... two shall arise .
professor .
i'm all right .
professor .

you are very sick .
i don't want hellboy to know .
sixty years ago , they tried to destroy the world .

we miss you at the bureau .
abe's crazier every day .
father's still mad at me .

no , h. b.
no , not this time .
i don't like it here ... ... but i haven't had an episode in months .
and you know what?
i'm learning to control it .
i'm learning where it comes from .
for the first time in my life ... ... i'm not afraid .
looks like your ride is here .

the nanny squad .

you were burned by some organic acid .
i'm lucky that way .
i worry about you .
me?
well ... ... i won't be around forever , you know .
damn !
could you please be a little careful?
big baby .
how long was it latched onto you?
i don't know .
about five seconds .
professor , look .
is it bad?
touched you five seconds , laid three eggs .
didn't even buy me a drink .
the stinger detaches itself from the tongue and injects the eggs .
they are very sensitive to heat and light .
they need a humid , dark environment to breed .
did you ever lose track of him?
well , let's see .
there was that moment when i had the train on top of my head .
we can't risk it .
tomorrow you'll go back to the tracks with a group of agents .
search the whole place top to bottom .
find those eggs and destroy them .
elizabeth sherman .
i don't like the term " fire starter .
i just don't .
and " pyrokinesis " sounds like some psychosis or something .
i don't know .
maybe that's right .
not being able to let go .
it's scary .
i black out after each episode .
sometimes for hours .
you hear about so and so ... ... who just lost control and just exploded .
well , they're lucky it isn't true .
with me , it is .
my master is calling your name now , my girl .
you must return to the child .
so once again ... ... dream ... ... of fire .
hey , freak !

freak !
oh , no !

oh , no !
somebody !
help me !
help me , somebody !
help me !
how many buildings does she have to burn down?
she belongs here .
that's not what she feels .
she may never feel it .
it's her choice .
professor , the girl you're
professor , that girl you're talking about ...
hey , boy scout ... ... think twice .
no , listen , i read her file .
" read her file . " she blames herself ... ... for that explosion in pittsburgh .
look , i think i can help .
i could talk to her .
i think i could bring her back .
just what was it that landed you this job pushing " pamcakes , " huh?
what was it?
punctuality?
the way you part your hair?
what is your area of expertise?
he doesn't want me with him .
i know that much .
you're doing fine .
no , i'm not .
look , he respects clay , not me .
i'm really sorry , okay?
i'm not your guy .
i'm dying , agent myers .
like any father , i worry about him .
in medieval stories , there is often a young knight ... ... who is inexperienced ...
... but pure of heart .
come on .
look , i am not pure of heart .
yes , you are .
rasputin is back for him .
what i ask of you ... ... is to have the courage to stand by him when i am gone .
he was born a demon .
can't change that .
but you will help him ... ... in essence ... ... to become a man .
pull that down .
she was making great progress ... ... and now this .
we'll be closed for months .
and it put a big dent in our thorazine supply .
she's been like this since it happened .
are you sure you want to go in?
miss sherman?
i'm agent myers , fbl .
miss sherman?
can i call you liz?
it's a beautiful name .
sixty percent of all the women in the world are named liz .
well , it's impressive by my standards .
my name's john .
john t. myers .
dr. broom asked me to invite you back to the bureau .
no special precautions , no security escorts .
just you and me in a taxi like regular folks .
over here .
you said those eggs need it dark and humid?
well , they hit the jackpot .
the subway lines , they all converge right around here .
right below us is the old vandeveer reservoir .
it was abandoned in the mid 30s .
there's a pulse .
there .
a cistern on the other side .
most of the eggs are there .
there's no way in .
we should go back and request a special permit , type 2
you guys coming or what?
we lead a charmed life .
here you are , doctor .
this should cover your tail fin .
reliquary .
straight from the vatican .
a bone from st. dionysius .
looks like a pinkie .
remind me why i keep doing this .
rotten eggs and the safety of mankind .
this doesn't really look like doll's hair .
be honest , red .
what do you think?
i'm thinking about doing it myself .
hey , you guys find anything?
no eggs yet , red .
what , are you on a lunch break?
nothing here .
red's on the move .
i'll cover him .
damn it , red .
hey , it's abe .

clay probably won't survive the night .
not now , manning , please .
you're reckless .
these men trusted you to lead them as a team .
where were you?
i knew those men better than you did .
that makes it all right , then .
no , it doesn't make it all right .
but i stopped that thing , didn't i?
yes , you did .
but i stopped that thing , didn't i?
yes , you did .
it's what you do .
it's why we need you .

you have an insight .
you know monsters .
what are you trying to say?
what are you trying to say?
this whole thing is a farce .

bread crumbs on the trail .
like in a fable .
they both distract him ... ... and guide him exactly where i need him .
moscow .
his destiny .
and the last clue ... ... will be left by the late professor broom .
you raised the child .
nurtured him .
so in return ... ... i will permit you ... ... a brief , brief glimpse of the future .
he will open the portal ... ... and bring about the end of the world .
if only you had had him destroyed 60 years ago ... ... none of this would have come to pass .
but then , how could you have known?
your god chooses to remain silent .
mine lives within me .
every time i died and crossed over ... ... a little more of the master ... ... came back with me .
he disclosed to me the child's true name .
would you like to know it?
i know what to call him .
i call him ... ... son .
i'm ready .
it'll be quick .
just go there and tell her how you feel .
my mom says that ...
look , it's not ...
it's not that easy , okay?
plus , you're 9 .
you're not old enough to be giving me advice .
all right , stand by .
who are those guys?
liz , i'm sorry .
it's broom .
let's go .
we need to find him .
no !
wait , what happened?
no !
it's okay .
no , not him .
would you take her?
something's wrong .
he hasn't spoken to anybody in three days .
not a word .
he won't eat , he won't sleep .
i've never seen him like this .
never .
should i stay?
with him , i mean?
listen , i'm not much of a problem solver .
three decades , i've only completed two sides .
but i do know this much .
if there's trouble ... ... all us freaks have is each other .
and i'm stuck here .
so ... ... take care of the big monkey for me , will you?
volokolamsk fields , 50 miles from moscow , that's where we're going .
sebastian plackba , number 16 .
that's the only clue we have .
we've collected and destroyed thousands of eggs ... ... but we have no trace of this sammael or this rasputin character .
we leave as soon as we get clearance and equipment .
hellboy's coming .
i'm not pleased about that , but i'll be in charge this time .
we either wrap this up or i'm closing this freak show for good .
hi .
hi .
i'll ... ... come to moscow ... ... if you're still going .
i am .
but i have something to say .
i understand what you don't like about me .
i do .
what i am ... ... makes you feel a little out of place ... ... out there .
red , i don't ...
listen .
i'm not like myers .
he makes you feel like you belong ... ... which is good , really .
i wish i could do something about this .
i can't .
one , i'll always look this good .
and two ... ... l'll never give up on you .
ever .
i like that .
one falls , two shall arise .
sammael .
we'll have to nail them all at once , and the eggs .
and when we do , no mumbo jumbo .
double core vulcan 65 grenades .
we've installed a handy little timer .
you set it , you walk away .
cable pulls the safety pins .
kaboom .
easy to clean , easy to use .
sparky to big red .
do you read me?
come in .
sparky "?
who came up with that?
myers?
yeah , we're leaving the main road , so hang on .
this better be the place or i'll puke .
you better come out and see .
sebastian plackba , number 16 .
forget it .
we're never gonna find rasputin's mausoleum .
now , what we do here is we make up a grid .
we go in by quadrants .
maybe satellite photography .
let me ask for directions .
what'd he say?
come on , baby , find me a talker .
hi there .
come on .
come on .
come on .
what do you want?
this is ridiculous .
i run this show , not him .
this guy's nothing but trouble .
anybody got a powerbar?
hey , there he is .
sixty feet further , comrades .
and three rows in .
what the hell is that on his back?
this here is lvan klimentovich .
say " hi , " lvan .
go that way , red monkey !
gotcha .
ivan says there's a whole network of tunnels down here .
goes on for miles .
stay close , everybody .
you better be right about this .
we'll be all right as long as we don't separate .
hey , sparky .
tell everyone to turn their locator belts on .
anybody sees anything ...
i'll say " marco .
polo .
are you sure about this?
two .
don't worry , boy scout , she'll take care of you .
she's a tough one .
come on .
ask your buddy how far this thing goes .
how you doing up there , lvan?
if i had legs i'd kick your ass !
would you mind holding this guy for a while?
he is so negative .
what the hell is that?
something big .
lime , come with me .
right .
no , no , no .
stay put !
stop !
you listen to me .
listen to me !
i'm in charge .
we're gonna go back .
you can take that door apart .
whatever it is , it's coming for us .
now , we gotta move forward !
lime , let's go !
stay put !
and you !
i am not afraid of you !
i'm in charge !
we go back !
i was better off dead !
oh , crap .
music .
really went deep .
hey , what's wrong with you? !
you killed my father .
your ass is mine .
what are you laughing at , you nazi son of a ...?
don't even think about it .
that's all for you , pinhead .
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
having a ...
you never light a cigar that way .
you use a wooden match .
preserves the flavor .
you see?
thank you .
thank you .
so he thinks you and i ...
that's why he's mad at me .
but it's not true , right?
what?
well , that , you know , you feel that way about me .
you want to know that here?
now?
yeah .
red , white , whatever .
guys are all the same .
hey , wait up .
have you found them yet?
i got them right below me .
it's a matter of minutes .
okay , good .
could you hurry up?
because it's a little spooky in here .
liz , wait .
oh , my god .
let's back out real slow .
let's back out real slow .
myers , ready your grenades .
marco .
marco .
marco .
get your big , red butt over here .
i'm coming for you , kid !
no piggybacks !
get off me , you ...
liz , no !
they're gonna kill him !
do something !
what do you want me to do?
hit me .
what?
hit me .
now !
you should be running .
they are all here .
all of them .
just the way it was promised .
this one's awake .
thank you for this .
and i looked ... ... and beheld an angel .
and in his right hand , the key to the bottomless pit .
these were the words i heard as a peasant boy in tobolsk .
and now , the door .
sent by the ogdru jahad ... ... so that they might at long last enter our world .
you are the key , the right hand of doom .
your stone hand .
what did you think it was made for?
open the locks .
don't do it , red !
don't do it !
silence .
imagine it .
an eden ... ... for you and her .
no .
no?
in exchange for her soul , then?
open the door .
no .
as you wish .
no !
liz !
her soul awaits on the other side .
if you want her back ... ... open the door and claim her .
your true name is inscribed around the locks that hold you .
you cannot break them ... ... no matter how strong you are .
the eclipse has begun .
your true name ... ... say it !
become the key .
for her .
anung un rama .
repeat it .
anung un rama .
open the final lock .
remember who you are !
believe me , i have lived long enough to know ... ... not a tear will be shed for this world !
you have a choice .
your father gave you that .
no , you don't !
open it !
do it !
what have you done?
i chose .
you will never fulfill your destiny .
you will never understand the power inside you .
i'll just have to find a way to live with that .
child .
look what you've done .
you've killed me ... ... an insignificant man .
but you have brought forth ... ... a god .
myers , let's go .
hell will hold no surprises for us .
i took a grenade belt .
the damn thing's broken .
keep her safe , will you?
whatever happens , don't leave her alone .
i won't .
you're okay , myers .
stick around .
hey , red .
just pull the cable .
i didn't get you anything .
are you going to be okay alone?
how big can it be?
damn !
damn .
oh , this is gonna hurt .
gonna be sore in the morning .
she's got no pulse .
she's not breathing .
liz?
i was so foolish .
red .
in the dark ...
... i heard your voice .
what did you say?
i said , " hey ... ... you on the other side ... ... let her go .
because for ...
for her i'll cross over .
and then you'll be sorry .
what makes a man a man?
a friend of mine once wondered .
is it his origins?
the way he comes to life?
i don't think so .
it's the choices he makes .
not how he starts things ... ... but how he decides to end them .
hey , guys?
i'm still here .
hello?
