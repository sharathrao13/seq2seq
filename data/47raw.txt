hmm , stir crazy , cabin fever , who knows?
u. s. number 31 , calling mcmurdo .

u. s. number 31 , calling mcmurdo , urgent !

nobody !
nobody .

get ahold of anybody !
we gotta report this mess !
look , i haven't been able to reach shit in two weeks !
i doubt if anybody's talked to anybody on this entire continent , and you want me to reach somebody !
maybe we at war with norway .
i was wondering when el capitan was gonna get a chance to use his popgun .
how long they been stationed there?
it says here only eight weeks .
that's not long enough for guys to go bonkers .
bullshit , bwana .
five minutes is enough to put a man over down here .
damn straight .
i mean , look at palmer .
he been the way he is since the first day .
how many in their party?
they started with ten .
there'd be eight others left .
how do we know?
guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us .
nothing we can do .
oh , yes there is .
i want to go up .
in this weather?
bennings?
winds are gonna let up a tad next couple of hours .
a tad?
can't condone it much myself , but it is a short haul .
an hour there , an hour back .
shit , doc , i'll give you the lift .
no problem .
forget it , palmer .
thanks for thinkin 'about it though .
loaded with kerosene .
i count 15 cans .
macready !
mac , get your gear on .
it may not clear up for a week , and we're the closest to 'em .
it's all right by me , doc .
i'm just letting you know we're taking a chance .
quit griping , macready .
if we get caught in a white out , you can scratch one doctor and one pilot .
this is real thin .
it'll clear as soon as you get up .
it's up to you , mac .
if you don't wanna fly , we don't fly .
you really wanna save those crazy swedes , huh?
norwegians .
which way , doc?
southwest .
you have to read the map 'cause i'm gonna be busy .
mac's really taking it up , huh?
he knows what he's doing .
nauls , will you turn that crap down?
i'm trying to get some sleep .
i was shot today .
oui , bwana .
will do .?
very superstitious?
?
writing's on the wall?
?
very superstitious?
anybody there?
hey , sweden?
they're not swedish , mac , they're norwegian .
mac !
my god !
what the hell happened here?
come on , doc .
portable video unit .
anything?
it's all in norwegian .
what are ya doin ', doc?
it could be important work .
i wanna take it back with us .
it's gettin 'late .
let's hurry it up .
i'll check out the last few rooms .
hey , copper , come here !
maybe they found a fossil , the remains of some animal buried in the ice ,
and they chopped it out .
but where is it?
look at this .
what is that?
is that a man in there or something?
whatever it is , they burned it up in a hurry .
help me find a shovel , doc .
we found this .
jesus christ !
blair , i'd like you to start an autopsy right away .
did you reach anybody yet?
reach anybody?
we're a thousand miles from nowhere , man , and it's gonna get a hell of a lot worse before it gets any better !
well , stick to it , windows , stick to it .
nothin 'wrong with this norwegian , physiologically anyway .
no drugs , no alcohol , nothin '.
hmm .
well , what we got here is what appears to be , anyway , a normal set of internal organs .
heart ,
lungs , kidneys , liver , intestines .
seem to be normal .
... one , door number two and door number three .
i think that dawn screen here has got the most to trade in .
i went to you first .
you brought your friend , anna .
you've been consulting anna all through the show .
you may as well consult her one more time .
i know how this one ends .
clark , will you put this mutt with the others where it belongs?
yeah , okay .
go ahead .
go ahead .
what are you waiting for?
i don't know what the hell's in there .
it's weird and pissed off , whatever it is .
bennings , go get childs .
what is this?
what's goin 'on?
hey , palmer , what is this?
i don't know .
childs !
mac wants the flamethrower !
mac wants the what?
that's what he said !
now , move !
damn it !
stand back .
mac , what is it?
no !
no !
god !
don't !
don't !
no !
get back !
get back !
get your ass over here !
burn it !
damn it , childs , torch it !
oh , my god .
oh !
ohh !
look .
son of a bitch .
what we're talking about here is an organism ... that imitates other life forms , and it imitates them perfectly .
when this thing attacked our dogs , it tried to digest 'em , absorb them .
and in the process shape its own cells to imitate them .
this , for instance .
that's not dog .
it's imitation .
we got to it before it had time to finish .
finish what?
finish imitating these dogs .
easy .
easy .
good .
easy .
easy .
clark?
yeah?
did you notice anything strange about the dog , anything at all?
strange?
no .
what was the dog doing in the rec room?
i don't know .
he was just wandering around camp all day .
are you sayin 'to me the dog wasn't put in the kennel until last night?
right .
how long were you alone with that dog?
i don't know , an hour , hour and a half maybe .
what the hell you lookin 'at me like that for?
i don't know .
what?
i don't know .
it's probably nothin '.
it's nothin 'at all .
how much more of this crap is there?
oh , nine hours i'd say .
we can't learn anything from this .
guess not .
where'd they take these shots?
seems like they were spending a lot of their time ... in a little place northeast of their camp about five or six miles .
what's that?
it looks like something buried under the ice .
and look at that , they're planting thermite charges .
whatever it was , it was bigger than the block of ice you found .
here .
this is it , the place where they were spending most of their time .
pretty nasty out .
35 knots .
screw it .
i'm gonna go up anyway .
half a mile due east .
jesus !
how long you figure this has been in the ice?
well , the backscatter effect's been bringin 'things up ... from way down around here for a long time .
i'd say ...
i'd say the ice it's buried in ... is 100, 000 years old at least .
and those norwegians blew it up .
yeah .
i don't know .
thousands of years ago it crashes and this thing ... gets thrown out or crawls out and it ends up freezing in the ice .
i just cannot believe any of this voodoo bullshit .
childs , happens all the time , man .
they're fallin 'out of the skies like flies .
government knows all about it .
right , mac?
do you believe any of this voodoo bullshit , blair?
childs?
childs , chariots of the gods , man .
they practically own south america .
i mean , they taught the incas everything they know .
so , come on now , macready .
the norwegians get ahold of this ...
and they dig it up out of the ice .
yes , garry , they dig it up , they cart it back , it gets thawed out , wakes up , probably not in the best of moods .
i don't know ...
which one of you disrespectful men ... been tossin 'his dirty drawers in the kitchen trash can , huh?
from now on , i want my kitchen clean , all right?
germ free !
now , how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice?
and how can it look like a dog?
i don't know how .
'cause it's different than us , see .
'cause it's from outer space .
what do you want from me?
ask him .
you buy any of this , blair?
mac , we're movin 'those things out of the lab into the storeroom .
can you come get your stuff?
be there in a minute , doc .
through the door .
right over there .
right over there .
sorry , mac .
you have to move your stuff ...
doc says we gotta stash 'em in here and lock 'em up .
i have to talk to you .
i'm tired of talking , fuchs .
i just want to get up to my shack and get drunk .
mac , it's important .
what is it?
outside .
it's 40 below outside .
in the thiokol .
please , mac .
we ought to just burn these things .
can't burn the find of the century .
that's gonna win somebody the nobel prize .
you got the keys?
get 'em from garry .
i want to get some stuff out of here .
there's something wrong with blair .
he's locked in his room and won't answer the door .
i took one of his notebooks from the lab .
listen .
yeah?
it could have imitated a million life forms on a million planets .
it could change into any one of them at any time .
now it wants life forms on earth ...
it's gettin 'cold ,
and i haven't slept in two days .
wait a minute , mac .
it needs to be alone and in close proximity with the life form to be absorbed .
the chameleon strikes in the dark .
is blair cracking up?
damn it , macready .
there's still cellular activity in these burned remains .
they're not dead yet .
let's go , bennings .
i gotta get some sleep .
holy shit .
go get the doc .
i'll get garry .
we'll meet in blair's room .
all right .
it's bennings !
bennings was right there , mac !
i swear it had ahold of him !
windows , get back !
keep away from him !
don't touch him !
get back !
stay back !
it isn't bennings !
my god !
what was happening to him?
if it had time to finish , it would have looked and sounded and acted just like bennings !
i don't know what you're saying .
that was one of those things , trying to imitate him , garry .
come on .
macready , i've known bennings for ten years .
he's my friend .
we gotta burn the rest of them .
all right , step back .
you sure that's all of 'em?
we cleaned out the storehouse , the lab .
there is nothing left .
where's blair?
i can't find blair .
where's everybody else?
windows is in the radio room still trying to get through .
everyone else is in the rec room .
you go on .
i'll be in in a minute .
blair?
blair?
don't come in here !
i got a gun !
i got an ax !
don't , you son of a bitch !
don't come in here !
you understand me?
he's got a gun , mac !
anybody interferes , i'll kill 'im !
jesus !
he smashed up some of the chopper pretty good .
childs , go see if he got to the tractor .
nobody gets in and out of here !
nobody !
you guys think i'm crazy !
well , that's fine !
most of ya don't know what's going on around here !
but i'm damn well sure some of you do !
christ !
he got most of the chopper and the tractor , and he's killed the rest of the dogs .
garry , wait a minute !
wait a minute !
all right , childs , go around to the map room door .
talk to him .
okay .
go on .
norris , get a table from the lab .
do you think that thing wanted to be an animal?
no dogs make it a thousand miles through the cold .
no , you don't understand !
that thing wanted to be us !
a cell gets out , it could imitate everything on the face of the earth !
and nothing could stop it !
okay , blair .
come on now , you don't want to hurt anybody .
i'll kill you !
good shot , macready .
excuse me .
all right , bring him up .
lift him up .
yeah .
okay .
okay .
come on , blair .
what about your shack , macready?
i don't want him in my shack .
we'll lock him in the toolshed .
why am i in here?
for your own protection , blair ... and ours .
how you doin ', old boy?
i don't know who to trust .
i know what you mean , blair .
trust is a tough thing to come by these days .
tell you what?
why don't you just trust in the lord?
watch clark .
what?
i said , " watch clark .
and watch him close , do you hear me?
now the radio's gone .
so are the choppers .
we're completely cut off .
all we can do now is hole up 'til spring and wait for the rescue team .
no , we don't wait .
somebody in this camp ain't what he appears .
right now that may be one or two of us .
by spring it could be all of us .
so how do we know who's human?
if i was an imitation ... a perfect imitation ... how would you know if it was really me?
is there some kind of test , doc?
well , yeah ... possibly .
i've been thinking about a blood serum test .
what's that?
we could take a sample of each person's blood .
we could mix it with uncontaminated blood .
i suppose if there's a reaction , we'd know who isn't human .
we've got whole blood in storage .
here , start working on it .
keep an eye on clark .
he was close to that dog .
yeah .
yeah .
mac , we need blair's help .
he's the only one ...
who knows what this organism is capable of .
he's too far gone , fuchs .
but get the rest of his notebooks and start going through them .
garry !
hey , you guys , come here !
what?
somebody got to the blood !
what?
where's clark?
right here .
wait a minute , wait a minute .
was this broken into?
no , the lock is undamaged .
somebody opened it , closed it , then locked it .
great .
who's got access to it?
i guess i'm the only one .
and i got the only key .
would that test have worked , doc?
oh , i think so , yes .
somebody else sure as hell thought so .
well , who else could have used that key?
nobody !
i just give it to copper whenever he needs it !
could anybody have gotten it from you , doc?
i don't see how .
as soon as i'm finished , i return it right away .
great .
when was the last time you used it?
a day or so ago .
i suppose somebody could have lifted it off me ...
oh , come on !
that key ring is always hooked to your belt .
accusing everybody ...
stop it now !
it ain't worth it !
copper's the only one who's got any business with it .
wait a minute !
you've been in here on several occasions !
doc thought of the test .
that clears him?
bullshit !
why would he take ...
shut up , man !
windows !
windows !
put that down .
no .
i'll put this right through your head .
you guys gonna listen to garry , let him give the orders?
he could be one of those things !
windows , wait a minute .
just take it easy .
put the gun down .
put it down .
garry , you don't want to hurt anybody .
get back .
on the floor .
it's on the floor .
i don't know about copper , but i give you my word , i did not go near that blood .
but i guess you'll all feel a little easier ... if somebody else was in charge .
norris , i can't see anybody objecting to you .
i'm sorry , fellas , but i i i'm not up to it .
i'll take it .
like hell you will .
it should be somebody a little more even tempered , childs .
all right .
i know i'm human .
and if you were all these things , then you'd just attack me right now .
so some of you are still human .
this thing doesn't want to show itself .
it wants to hide inside an imitation .
it'll fight if it has to , but it's vulnerable out in the open .
if it takes us over , then it has no more enemies , nobody left to kill it .
and then it's won .
there's a storm hitting us in six hours .
we're gonna find out who's who .
all right , doc , garry and clark move over there away from the others .
norris , you and childs shoot 'em up with morphine .
tie 'em down and watch 'em .
fuchs , you start workin 'on a new test .
i need doc's help .
yeah , you don't want to drug me .
mac , i'm not a prisoner !
here , let me do it .
you're gonna break the needle in my arm .
no , doc .
he's doin 'a real fine job .
i'm gonna hide this tape when i'm finished .
if none of us make it , at least there'll be some kind of record .
storm's been hitting us hard now for 48 hours .
we still have nothing to go on .
one other thing .
i think it rips through your clothes when it takes you over .
windows found some shredded long johns , but the name tag was missing .
they could be anybody's .
nobody ...
nobody trusts anybody now .
and we're all very tired .
nobody trusts anybody now .
there's nothing else i can do .
just wait .
r. j. macready , helicopter pilot , u. s. outpost number 31 .
you come up with anything yet?
one or two ideas .
but , macready , i've been thinking .
if a small particle of this thing is enough to take over an entire organism , then everyone should prepare their own meals .
i suggest we only eat out of cans .
all right .
who's that?
anybody see fuchs?
somebody blew out a fuse in the lab .
lights were out for an hour .
any one of us could have gotten to him .
all right , we gotta find him .
nauls , why don't you come with me and we'll look outside .
palmer , you and windows check the inside .
i ain't goin 'with windows .
i ain't goin 'with him .
i'll go with childs .
hey , fuck you , palmer !
i ain't goin 'with you !
who says i want you goin 'with me?
all right , cut the bullshit !
windows , you come with us .
norris , you stay here .
any of them move , you fry 'em .
you hear anything at all , you cut loose on the sirens .
we all meet back here in 20 minutes , regardless !
and everybody watch whoever you're with , real close .
hey , blair !
blair , have you seen fuchs?
i don't want to stay out here anymore .
i want to come back inside .
funny things .
i hear funny things out here .
have you come across fuchs?
it ain't fuchs .
it ain't fuchs .
i'm not gonna harm anybody , and there's nothing wrong with me .
and if there was , i'm all better now .
i'd like to come back inside .
you got my promise .
we'll see .
hey , wait a minute .
wait a minute , man .
i want to come back inside .
don't you understand?
i'm all right .
i'm much better .
i won't harm anybody .
you gotta let me come back inside .
hold it !
is it fuchs?
yeah .
why would it burn him?
flare .
maybe he tried to burn it .
maybe he burned himself ... before it could get to him .
great !
now what are we gonna do?
you go inside .
tell the others we found fuchs .
we'll be in as soon as we can .
where are we goin '?
up to my shack .
what the hell for?
'cause when i left , i turned the lights off .
how long have they been out there?
forty , forty five minutes .
we better start closing off the outside doors .
hey !
all of you come here !
open up !
open up this door !
open up !
open up !
close that door .
where's macready?
i cut him loose of the line up by his shack .
cut him loose?
yeah .
we were up checkin 'around his place .
i found this .
look .
it was stashed in his own oil furnace .
wind must have dislodged it , but i don't think he saw me find it .
i made sure i got ahead of him on the towline on the way back .
i cut him loose .
macready?
he's one of them .
when did it get to him?
i don't know .
it could have been anytime , anywhere .
if it did get to him .
look , childs , come on !
when the lights went out !
that would have been the perfect time .
right !
you said guys were missing .
and , windows , where were you?
palmer , i told you to shut the fuck up !
where were you when the lights when out?
to pit us against each other !
guys !
it's macready .
shh !
let's open it .
hell no !
do you think he's changed into one of those things?
he's had plenty of time .
nothing human could have made it back here without a guideline .
let's open it now !
why are you so damn anxious to let him in here?
'cause it's so close !
may be our best chance to blow it away !
no !
just let him freeze to death outside .
what if we're wrong about him?
why , then we're wrong !
supply window !
all right , all right .
we got no choice now !
damn it !
he's got the keys !
what's goin 'on?
the towline snapped .
that's bullshit , childs .
he knows damn well i cut it .
you're a dead man , macready !
or a dead whatever the hell you are !
anyone messes with me and the whole camp goes .
come on , childs , burn me .
put those torches on the floor and back off .
back off .
way off .
you asshole .
you'd have done the same thing .
don't argue with him .
where's the rest?
so help me , i mean it !
it's cool , macready .
it's cool , man !
come on !
yeah , yeah , man .
just relax .
anybody touches me , and we go .
he's not breathin '!
go untie the doc .
get him in here .
and bring the others .
from now on , nobody gets out of my sight .
lay him there .
so you sweethearts ... were about to have yourselves a little lynching party , huh?
i might just have to put an end to you on general principles , nauls .
did it occur to the jury that anybody could have stuck some of my clothes up the furnace?
we ain't buyin 'that .
quit that bickering over there !
windows , wheel that defibrillator over here !
put some gel on those paddles !
you're gonna have to sleep sometime , macready .
i'm a real light sleeper , childs .
if anyone tries to wake me ...
uh uh .
clear !
clear !
clear .
we're on fire , macready !
get back !
just wait !
we're on fire !
just wait !
all right , go !
windows !
windows , get in here !
you gotta be fuckin 'kidding .
what do you got in mind , macready?
a little test .
windows , you and palmer tie everybody down real tight .
what for?
for your health .
let's rush him !
he's not gonna blow us all up !
no , no , wait a minute .
wait a minute .
let's do what mac says .
i mean , he wasted norris pretty quick , didn't he?
that's close enough , clark .
he ain't tyin 'me up .
then i'll have to kill you .
then kill me .
i mean it .
i guess you do .
this is bullshit , mac !
finish it , palmer .
they're dead , mac !
windows?
yo?
you tie up palmer over here .
we're gonna draw a little bit of everybody's blood .
'cause we're gonna find out who's the thing .
watching norris in there gave me the idea that ... maybe every part of him was a whole .
every little piece was an individual animal ... with a built in desire to protect its own life .
you see , when a man bleeds , it's just tissue .
but blood from one of you things won't obey when it's attacked .
it'll try and survive ; crawl away from a hot needle , say .
now you .
that's good .
all right , move back .
over there .
i guess you're okay .
all right , put that on and watch them .
now i'll show you what i already know .
that's a crock of shit .
let's try the doc and clark .
now clark .
then clark was human , huh?
which makes you a murderer , don't it?
palmer now .
this is pure nonsense .
it doesn't prove a thing .
i thought you'd feel that way , garry .
you were the only one that could have got to that blood .
we'll do you last .
get away from me !
macready , burn it !
what is it?
get him , get him !
just shoot !
macready , shoot !
get it , mac !
get it !
windows !
blast him !
get me outta here !
windows !
damn !
get me outta here !
macready !
get in here !
quick , come on !
hurry up !
it's coming back !
burn it !
burn it , for god's sake !
burn it !
burn it !
hurry up , macready !
let's do it .
get me outta here !
cut me loose !
cut me the hell ...
come on , get me outta here !
come on , get me outta here !
cut me loose , damn it !
i know you gentlemen have been through a lot , but when you find the time ,
i'd rather not spend the rest of this winter ... tied to this fucking couch !
childs ... we're goin 'out to give blair the test .
if he tries to make it back and we're not with him , burn him .
mac , the door is open .
how'd he get out?
the door was bolted from the outside .
blair?
hey , blair !
you down there?
we got something for ya !
blair's been busy out here all by himself .
what is it?
something he's been making .
it's a ship of some kind .
he stole the parts from the helicopter .
smart s . o . b .
he put it together piece by piece .
where was he tryin 'to go?
anyplace but here .
hey , you guys , come here .
come here .
i think i saw childs outside the main entrance of the camp .
what's he doing outside?
i don't know .
got a flare?
he got back inside and blew the generator .
in six hours , it'll be 100 below in here .
well , that's suicide !
not for that thing .
it wants to freeze now .
it's got no way outta here .
it just wants to go to sleep until the rescue team finds it .
what can we do?
what can we do?
whether we make it or not , we can't let that thing freeze again .
maybe we'll just warm things up a little around here .
we're not gettin 'outta here alive ... but neither is that thing .
generator room .
generator's gone .
any way we can fix it?
it's gone , macready .
all right .
we gotta bring this whole place right down into the ice .
garry , plant yours in the old storage room .
nauls , down by the generator .
oh , god .
how's it comin 'in there?
i said , " how's it ...
yeah , fuck you too !
you the only one who made it?
not the only one .
did you kill it?
where were you , childs?
thought i saw blair .
i went out after him ... and got lost in the storm .
fires got the temperature up all over the camp .
won't last long though .
neither will we .
how will we make it?
maybe we shouldn't .
