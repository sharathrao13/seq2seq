bobby?
bobby , where are you?
answer me .
i know you can hear me .
mr. kane?
mr. kane , do you know where you are?
do you remember what happened?
try and follow the light with your eyes .
you've had an accident .
you were flying an airplane , and the plane went down .
you've been unconscious for quite a long time .
my name is dr. fellows ... ... and i'm here to help you get your life back .
what happened to my family?
i'm sorry , mr. kane .
kristina !
kristina !
paul kane?
lawrence augenblick , personal injury solicitor .
i wonder if you could spare me a few?
do you mind?
here's my card .
i know this is no time to be using the " s " word ... ... but you should know the plane you were flying ...
... had parts and maintenance issues .
how did you get in?
give us a minute .
this is important .
i have to ask you to leave .
don't be a victim , mr. kane .
make the buggers pay .
i think we did a very nice job , even though i do say so myself .
the door wouldn't open .
no one's blaming you .
i don't remember anything else .
you will .
it will all come back .
they have a haunting fragrance , don't they?
i heard about your family .
i thought you might appreciate an american voice .
i just can't tell you how sorry i am .
thank you .
but , paul , you know , this dr. fellows is not ....
she's a private contractor , hired from the outside for your rehab ... ... and that means that ... ... your discretion is required .
god , it's good to see you again , paul .
when was the last time?
i can't quite remember .
i remember .
it was paris .
yes , of course , paris .
be careful what you say to dr. fellows , paul .
very good .
your hand eye coordination is improving .
keep this up and you'll be back in the office in no time .
what office?
it's a figure of speech .
your file says you work from home , been in the country nearly two years .
some sort of consulting business , i think .
luckily , you don't need good hand eye coordination for that .
you speak french very well .
well , i studied in switzerland for a year .
yours isn't bad either .
my mother was french .
that's all she spoke around the house when i was growing up as a kid .
what else does it say in my file?
you're 44 years old , 6 feet tall , 200 pounds , and you have exceptional reflexes .
what does it say in your file?
that i'm a psychiatrist specializing in trauma .
how did you know i speak french?
wild guess .
you ready?
look familiar?
not really .
don't worry .
visual memory is only fragments of images at best .
your recovery means stitching them together into something that makes sense .
where are they buried?
when was the funeral?
march .
my dad was a flyer , made a career out of the military .
i guess you could say i was an air force brat .
grew up on bases all over the world .
ltaly , germany , lots of different places .
he was shot down over north vietnam .
his body was never recovered .
which one is it?
it's that one .
the sign was kristina's idea .
she wanted it to be just like home .
i'd like to go in alone , if you don't mind .
this is not going to be easy .
you sure you're ready?
thanks for the ride , doctor .
hello , paul .
oh , hello , frank .
i've been picking up your mail .
it's on the table inside .
look , janet and i wanted you to know ... ... well , if there's anything we can do , please just let us know .
thank you , frank .
i appreciate that .
yes .
who is this?
kelton reed .
i just wanted to call , see if everything was okay .
everything's fine .
did you get the personal effects i sent over?
yes , i did .
i'm sorry , but we didn't know for sure if you were going to make it .
lf there's anything missing ....
no .
it looks like it's all here .
we'll talk soon , then .
good morning , mr. kane .
good morning .
i expect when you got home , a lot of things you'd forgotten came rushing back .
one or two .
it's not uncommon .
familiar surroundings .
sometime even the most mundane objects can trigger incredibly powerful memories .
memories can be vivid .
a smell , a sound .
paul?
what were you thinking about?
oh , nothing .
it was nothing .
i didn't tell dr. fellows about the gun , of course .
i didn't tell her about any of it .
my recruitment , my training .
what do you tell her?
oh , i tell her about bee stings and tree houses , about my first bicycle ... ... about catching frogs in the ditch behind the house i grew up in .
that's what she wants to hear about most of the time .
what kind of childhood i had , what i remember of it .
does she ask about your work?
sometimes .
it's a consulting business .
what's to know?
the reason you're here in london?
emerging markets .
that's good .
safe is good .
you are the best , paul , the best we have .
dr. fellows .
mr. kane .
i didn't hear from you today .
i was concerned .
oh , i apologize .
i meant to call .
i'm not interrupting anything , i hope .
no , no , i was just in the kitchen .
i'm sorry , were you eating?
i was gonna cook ... ... some pasta .
i eat out .
every night , in fact .
all by yourself?
mostly , yes .
you don't like company?
not particularly .
not unless it has to do with work .
it's the family house .
it's not surprising .
when i do think about them ... ... during holiday times , for example , i ....
must be very painful .
well , the strange thing is that i don't think about them that often .
people cope in different ways .
i know i'm supposed to feel guilty about that , but for some reason i don't .
and the things i do remember , some details are missing .
for example , i know that i should stop at a red light ... ... but i don't remember having ever stopped at one before .
it's the inability to access associative memory .
it's common with injuries like yours .
thank you .
i hope you like french .
yes , i do .
my mother was french .
yes , i know .
that's right , you know everything about me , and i know absolutely nothing about you .
what would you like to know?
what is your first name?
except that .
that's the thing i hate most .
why?
harriet .
that's bad?
harriet got five a levels and a double first from cambridge .
it was an anti boy signal , forced me to hit the books .
that's some name .
ever think of changing it?
oh , i did .
oh , i gave myself any number of names that i begged them to call me growing up .
lulu , cindy , anastasia .
didn't matter , the reality of harriet prevailed .
something to drink , sir?
and what if they had called you lulu or cindy or anastasia?
who knows?
you can't go back and relive your childhood under different circumstances , can you?
i don't think i'd want to .
i had a very happy childhood ... ... but it's an interesting idea .
so after i graduated from cambridge , i started research into
do you ...?
do you know those two men?
no , i don't think i do .
quite a party in prospect .
cocktails for a president in waiting .
thing is , if he does form the next government ... ... we lose all privileges .
what are we gonna do about that?
relax , already taken care of .
madam , monsieur , everything satisfactory?
wonderful , thank you .
no , i invited you , remember?
all right .
lf you'll excuse me just one second .
what's your name?
maynard .
are you following me , maynard?
orders .
kelton reed .
you tell him i'm ready .
ls everything all right?
everything's fine .
you mind if i drive?
i would ask you in , but ....
no , no , no .
i have an early appointment .
well , thanks for dinner .
paul .
it's so good to see you .
you know , kelton and i , when we lost ben , i didn't want to live any more .
but you gotta go on .
you know , you're like a son to him now .
here you go , sweetheart .
now you be real careful .
that's hot now .
billy , you back again?
how many of these things you gonna eat?
honey , look what i've got .
paul !
come on , let's get out of here .
you know , you broke maynard's nose .
the other guy's got cracked ribs .
who were those guys?
local assets .
ex british special forces .
not so special .
so you want to go back to work?
yeah , i think i do .
hello?
good morning , doctor .
oh , mr. kane .
i'm sorry to get you so early .
ls this a bad time?
no , no , it's fine .
ls there a problem?
no .
i just wanted to apologize .
i won't be able to make our next session .
i'm off on a business trip .
a business trip?
lsn't it a bit soon?
well , don't worry , i'm feeling all right .
where are you going?
amsterdam .
what's in amsterdam?
oh , a couple of meetings .
i see .
you may find that you have difficulty getting on the plane .
i don't think it will be a problem .
i didn't want you to be concerned .
i see .
well , have a good trip .
and if you experience any anxieties at all , don't hesitate to call me anytime .
thank you .
i'll be in touch .
i'm david .
joelle .
give me your hand .
excuse me , my wife  that's all right .
just go this way .
thank you .
oh , hello .
hello .
lovely meeting you .
nice to see you .
yes .
this is my wife , annette .
excuse me , sir .
i'm so sorry .
please , let me tend to that immediately .
excuse us , please .
here we are , sir .
make a wish , paul , and blow out the candles .
shoot him .
shoot him !
come on !
go !
lbrahim?
oh , god ! lbrahim?
oh , god !
i'm sorry .
money , now !
give me your watch .
now , the ring .
what's the next flight to london?
sorry , sir , nothing now until tomorrow morning .
shite !
yes?
i missed the train .
we know .
where are you?
i'm at the airport .
i don't know what happened .
it's all right .
your partner caught it in time .
i guess i wasn't as ready as i thought .
forget about it .
there'll be other trains .
when are you flying back?
ln the morning .
i'll be at heathrow at 6 . 40 .
i'll be waiting .
hello?
hi , it's paul .
i hope i didn't wake you .
no , no , no .
i needed to get up anyway .
where are you?
sounds like you're on a plane .
yes , i'm flying back this morning .
that was a short trip .
yeah , let me ask you a question .
who is chilly willy?
chilly willy?
it's a cartoon character , i think .
a cartoon character?
a penguin that's always cold .
that's all , nothing else?
cartoons can be very meaningful .
the joy of childhood ....
paul?
paul , are you still there?
yes , yes , i'm here .
paul , are you all right?
no , no .
come straight here from the airport .
do you still have my address?
yes .
i need to see you right away .
sir , switch your phone off , please .
i have to go now .
paul?
excuse me , miss .
what is this video?
it's a safety video .
lf you'd like to take your seat please , sir .
fasten your seat belt .
prepare for takeoff .
i need to go aboard .
maybe if you told me what you're looking for ....
what's happened?
paul kane killed three people yesterday .
oh , my god .
we have no motive .
worse , we have no idea of where he is .
do you?
no .
are you sure?
he hasn't contacted you at all?
he did call me from the plane .
he wanted to come and see me .
what about?
doctor?
he wanted to know who chilly willy was .
he remembers .
what size car , sir?
full size , medium or compact?
why don't you just give me any car with four wheels and a full tank of gas .
are you over 25 and with a major credit card?
he told me he was on a business trip .
why was i not informed of this?
i have no idea .
i didn't know anything about it either .
but i'll tell you what we do know .
your instincts about him are wrong .
lnstinct is not the issue .
i keep telling you .
i'm sorry , doctor , but i think it is exactly the issue .
see , i believe in nature .
lf nature selects you to be a cold blooded killer , then that is what you are .
you can't change that .
that's a very bleak view of the world .
lf people can't change , what hope is there?
it's been your job to prove me wrong .
i'm still waiting .
something must've gone wrong , something we didn't anticipate .
look , i'm not blaming you .
we both knew what we were dealing with .
what do you want me to do now?
stay put , hope he makes contact again .
you're closer to him than anyone .
now , don't worry .
you'll be under 24 hour surveillance , someone nearby at all times .
they made kane renting a car at the airport .
i've gotta go .
right , got it .
just get him before he leaves the airport .
hey , paul , what's going on?
frank !
you scared me .
get down .
someone's broken into my house .
my god , where?
don't let them see you .
come on inside , we'll call the police .
no , don't do that .
not yet .
let's go inside .
you keep an eye on them .
i'll call the police .
hello?
yes , this is frank butler , 93 winfield lane .
i'm here with my neighbor .
he says there's someone breaking into his house .
yes , he's here with me now .
that's what i said .
i don't know .
well , how long do you?
you know who i am?
you're mr. kane .
how do you know that?
because it says so on the sign in front of your house .
so it does .
hello?
hello?
paul , is that you?
paul , we want to help you .
can you hear me , paul?
it's like he's circling his territory .
we're not hunting an animal .
lawrence augenblick solicitors .
hi , sonia .
yeah , i know .
it's really quite
would you mind if i put you on hold?
okay .
hello , do you have an appointment?
no .
could you tell mr. augenblick that paul kane is here to?
thank you for coming in .
we'll set something up for next week .
thanks very much .
bye .
larry , this is mr.  no , don't tell me .
plane crash , severe head trauma .
mr ....
kane .
paul kane .
mr. kane .
i'm terrible with names , but i never forget an injury .
this is what the newspaper had to say .
according to the official report , that type of plane had six similar episodes recently .
now , i don't want to count any chickens  i want to show you something .
we're now going to take you through our safety procedures and equipment .
as this information is for your benefit , we ask that you watch and listen carefully .
the safety card shows details of the ...
mr. kane? ... oxygen masks and life jackets .
it also shows the bracing position ....
that's my wife .
oh , right , i'm sorry .
she was a beautiful woman .
she was never a flight attendant .
she was a graphic designer .
down toward the rear of the aircraft ....
something else i wanna show you .
can you read what it says?
looks like , " chilly willy .
yeah .
chilly willy was a cartoon character , a penguin .
now , you tell me , what's that doing in my mouth?
you suffered some pretty severe injuries , mr. kane .
i mean , head injuries .
you were unconscious for a long time .
that woman is my wife .
i'm telling you , literally , there's something wrong with this picture .
why me?
why not a private detective or the police if something's not kosher?
because i don't know who i can trust .
i'm just walking out for some cat food .
i'll be back in a minute .
excuse me .
what did they tell you?
what did they tell you?
that you murdered three people .
what else?
they want me to help bring you in .
who wants you to?
kelton reed?
don't lie to me .
i took a big risk following you here .
have you heard from him?
no , no , i haven't .
he'll contact you .
be careful .
why?
watch him .
i know it's ridiculous , asking you to trust me , but you're the only one ....
you know everything that i've been through .
paul , what happened in amsterdam?
i can't tell you that .
bloody hell !
you scared me to death .
how did you get in here?
you got cheap locks on your door .
i called the airline , tracked down the woman on the video .
she's not a flight attendant .
what did i tell you?
she's an actress .
her name's amy o'brien .
i spoke to her agent .
they sent me this .
i also found the airfield you flew out of on the day of your crash .
i thought i'd go and see what i can dig up .
i want to see her .
i wouldn't advise that .
she's my wife .
mr. kane  paul .
i believe you when you say she's your wife .
i mean , i believe you believe it .
but we've got a good case developing .
let's not blow it .
she's my wife .
you think she's your wife .
that's why i have to go and find out .
what are you doing?
what the hell is going on here?
don't look so surprised , doctor .
what are you doing with my notes?
he nearly killed one of my men last night .
you were there .
i don't need to tell you what happens if that material gets out of our hands .
tell me , how does paul kane know you?
what did he tell you?
you don't work for the justice department , do you?
no , but i work for a justice department .
you're gonna kill him , aren't you?
what was paul really doing in amsterdam?
business .
was it business for him to kill a malaysian politician and two of his bodyguards?
look , this is over .
i've always admired you and your work .
we'll take that into consideration when we evaluate your situation later .
blimey !
what happened?
came down near some trees about three miles over there .
the investigator says it was weather .
what do you say?
same .
do you always say what they say?
we've been over her from top to bottom .
no defects , nothing .
it's all in the official report .
weather , eh?
that's right .
excuse me .
excuse me , miss .
are you amy?
i'm sorry .
i don't ....
you're an actress , right?
who are you?
my name is paul .
i've seen some of your work .
i haven't really done much .
what did you see?
it was this thing where you were a wife , a mother .
you had ...
... children , two little girls  my god !
you saw that?
the interactive video thing?
that was so weird .
you saw it , really?
where did you see it , in the u. s.?
yes , that's right .
they didn't even send me a copy .
two days in the studio and then , " don't call us .
since then , it's been a little here , a little there ... ... but i'm still waiting for my big break .
can i ask you something?
was i all right?
i mean , the accent and all .
was i , you know , believable?
yes .
very .
well , it was very nice to meet you .
they said it was weather related .
the skies were clear that day .
i checked with the forecasts , newspapers .
nothing .
no , i remember the weather .
it was bad .
rainy , very stormy .
that won't hold up in court .
you can't remember a thing .
you're a head case .
sorry .
i don't know what's real .
all i've got are memories of things that never existed .
like that plane crash .
no , the plane is real .
i saw the plane .
and i saw the girl .
i held her hand .
i looked into her eyes , and she wasn't real .
all we gotta do is make sense of something that doesn't make sense .
chilly willy .
what?
you ever hear of somebody getting a tattoo on the inside of their lip?
what about it?
do many people get them there?
lots of people , in jail or reform school .
it's an american thing .
catching on over here .
jail , you say?
yeah .
tats is against the rules .
self mutilation , they call it .
that's why you put them there .
so nobody knows .
i've never been in prison .
that i know .
what , like you knew that actress was really your wife?
what are you saying?
i don't know .
maybe the crash wiped it from your head .
paul , you have told me everything , haven't you?
i mean everything?
yes .
yes .
except ... ... someone is trying to kill me .
actually , a team of men is trying to kill me .
right , and i was gonna invite you to stay at my place .
not exactly the ritz .
my ex wife cleaned me out .
lovely woman .
hey , that swing out there , who does that belong to?
my son's .
thanks .
i used to have one of those as a kid .
i'd swing high and bail out like a fighter pilot .
my kid does the same thing .
ls he with his mother?
yeah , i see him a couple times a month .
how old is he?
six .
nothing in the world gives you more perspective than having a kid .
oh , i'm sorry .
i didn't mean to  no , it's okay .
look , i've jabbered on long enough .
you get some sleep , okay?
you got a lot of troubles , paul , but i'm gonna help you .
promise .
thanks .
there you go .
you okay?
you were talking in your sleep .
yeah , i'm fine .
you know , i was thinking about what you said about the crash ...
... about me losing those memories .
yeah?
well , larry , that still doesn't explain kristina .
i mean , i watched her die .
they took me to her grave .
who did?
paper for dr. fellows .
slide over .
and please , no penguins .
paul , what happened in amsterdam?
you mean you really don't know?
where reed's concerned , i know less than you think .
i need to tell you something .
i kill people .
i'm an assassin for the united states government .
i need to tell you something .
no , you're not .
i was a research fellow at cambridge when they first approached me .
who?
they said the american justice department .
they wanted to see if a hardened criminal could be rehabilitated ... ... using a technique i'd been developing called clinical memory displacement .
the pilot study needed a particular kind of subject .
he was perfect , a sociopath with a high lq and multiple homicides to his credit .
his name was robert willard .
chilly willy .
let me get this straight , you saying i ain't gonna have no memory of my life now?
that's correct .
that's wild , man .
that's wild .
how you gonna do that?
through a procedure called displacement imprinting .
displacement imprint?
man , that's good .
hey .
where was you all 1 0 years ago when i was killing all them people?
well , maybe it's best .
do what you want .
kill me .
resurrect me .
i don't give a damn .
the first thing we did was to stage your execution .
national press coverage .
not even the warden knew .
then , we planted the story about the air crash in all the papers .
we'd already transported you to the lab that we'd set up here in this country .
reed was there representing the u. s. government .
we're ready , doctor .
let's party .
my belief was that if we could erase all of your bad memories from 0 to 6 ... ... and replace them with memories of love and support ... ... that we could eliminate willard's homicidal tendencies .
okay , okay .
make a wish , paul , and blow out your candles .
we matched your new identity with parts of willard's ... ... an air force father , bases all around the world .
but this time happy , more loving .
when we'd fixed your new personality ... ... we changed your appearance beyond recognition .
how long did all of this take?
seven months .
we kept you in a controlled coma for seven months .
please , excuse me , sir .
paul?
i need to know , those people in amsterdam ... ... did you?
no .
i couldn't do it .
but amsterdam was not my first mission .
it was the first real one .
you mean that reed?
hijacked the experiment .
yes .
and implanted another set of memories ... ... memories of being a hired assassin .
german cars .
i never saw anyone die like that , close up .
lf he found us , reed can't be far behind .
we need to tell someone .
look , it's me he's after .
i'll get out at the next train station .
no , don't do that .
why?
because i trust you ... ... more than i trust reed .
where are we going?
somewhere , anywhere they won't find us .
what is it?
both kane and willard grew up on bases here , right?
we matched parts of their biographies , yes .
did young kane spend any time on an air base here?
ln the u. k.?
no .
we didn't create anything like that .
you're absolutely sure?
yes .
why?
because i think bobby willard may have .
there's more .
we played here when i was a kid .
i left my mark on a tree somewhere over here .
look at that .
it's impossible .
lmpossible?
why , because you didn't put it there?
because it's something of my own?
there was a tin shack right over here somewhere .
watch your step here .
man ....
the old guy that lived here used to let us play out back .
i bet he's long gone now .
what are you doing?
it's 3 . 30 in the morning .
where else are we gonna stay?
i guess i owe you an apology .
for what?
for all of this , for them .
lf i hadn't agreed to do what i did l
i would be dead right now .
i realized that driving over here .
that , in spite of everything that you did to me ... ... if it weren't for you , i would be dead .
we're gonna have to tell people , go public .
it's the only it's the only way .
what's gonna happen when people find out that bobby willard is still alive?
ls he?
really?
well , what if reed is right?
what if nature does win out every time?
i don't believe that .
bobby willard cared for nothing and no one .
he was a murderer .
then who is paul kane?
he's everything i made him .
he's everything i wanted him to be .
where was you all 1 0 years ago when i was killing all them people?
just like a homing pigeon .
let's keep radio contact to clicks .
and for god's sake , don't shoot me .
paul , you okay?
this place is just as i remember .
well , that must be reassuring .
i mean it's exactly the same .
thirty four years have gone by and nothing's changed .
that paint is the same color .
that window was cracked in the same place .
that tree , the shape of those bushes .
that doesn't seem right .
unless ....
reed .
all right , stay here and try to stay out of sight .
i'm going in .
maynard , cover the front .
ford , take the right .
maynard , you copy that?
ford?
you copy that?
watch yourselves .
there's nobody home .
maynard?
ford , you hear me?
paul?
i know she's here , paul .
just want you to know , when i find her , she's dead .
after what she did to me , that's okay .
so long as i get you .
you hear that , doctor?
you must be so proud .
paul?
you know , paul , your dad used to drive a car just like that .
come on , son .
let's see what you got .
come on .
don't forget , i know all your moves .
too bad she gave you a conscience , paul .
you're an assassin who can't kill .
now what's the use of that?
there .
you see how easy it is?
paul .
how bad is it?
try not to move , just lie still .
did you empty the gun?
i'm so sorry .
last night i just i couldn't be sure .
what about now?
then it was worth it .
paul?
paul !
