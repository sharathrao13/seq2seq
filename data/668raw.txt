fairy tales tell , as their labels imply , stories of magic , of creatures that fly .
with giants and dragons and ogres and elves , and inanimate objects that speak for themselves .
d strange magic d oh , what a strange magic d oh , it's a strange magic d got a strange magic d got a strange magic
there's romance and danger and plotting of schemes .
there's good guys and bad guys and some guys in between .
a fairy tale also reveals some sort of truth , the perils of choices we face in our youth .
but our story today is different in theme , for our hero had no choice , or so it would seem .
d strange magic
it starts with a fairy bestowing a spell .
this one's for a baby named ella of frell . d got a strange magic d got a strange magic
now , now , ella .
mother's here .
there , now .
oh , dear ella .
oh , it's nothing a little burping won't cure .
up .
there , now .
come on .
all the way .
i gotta work on that .
whoa !
hello , ladies !
lucinda !
she gives the worst gifts .
not if she can't find the baby .
whoa !
ah !
lucinda here .
fairy par excellence .
now , where's the baby?
out walking .
at her grandmother's .
at her grandmother's .
out for a walk .
she's walking , at her grandmother's .
either way , as you see , she's not here .
oh , look .
she's back .
all right .
what shall we give this beautiful little child today?
what's her name again?
ella .
ah .
ella of frell .
not a very well behaved little stinker , is she?
quiet , please .
i can't concentrate here .
ella of frell , i give you the gift of obedience .
now , go to sleep .
now , wake up .
lsn't it wonderful?
no , it's terrible .
it's a terrible gift to have to do what you're told .
take it back .
i have a no return policy .
and if you're going to be ungrateful , i can always turn her into a squirrel instead .
a squirrel?
no , obedience is a lovely gift .
besides , you should thank me .
i've just given you the perfect child .
ln spite of the spell , ella grew up strong of mind .
her gift made her obedient , but her heart made her kind .
why don't you go back to where you came from?
yeah .
areida .
what a stupid name .
nobody wants you here .
i do .
bite me .
did you just see what ella did?
i made your favorite , so dig in and stuff your face .
i'm gonna get forks .
sweetie , stop .
i always knew something was wrong with me .
can't you take the spell back?
you're a fairy .
i'm only a household fairy , honey .
besides , according to fairy guidelines , only the fairy who gave you the gift can take it back , and we've begged her .
not only that , but she said she'd turn your mother into a squirrel and take away my eternal youth if we ever asked her again .
it's not fair .
i know , darling .
i know .
so ella now knew why she'd always obeyed .
but she never stopped fighting to have things her way .
ella !
come practice your mandolin .
fine , but i'll take my own sweet time doing it .
hurry up , now .
as she struggled to find a way out of her gift , she had no way of knowing something worse was adrift .
please get well , mother .
listen to me .
only mandy and i know about the gift .
we've never even told your father .
and you must never tell anyone else .
i don't want anyone using it against you .
mother , please .
remember , no matter what anyone says or tells you to do ,
look to yourself , ella .
what's inside you is stronger than any spell .
take this , then i'll always be with you .
d a strange magic d strange magic d a strange magic
ella .
your father would like to speak to you .
you're married?
she has money , ella .
and she's very fond of my title .
it was either get married or sell the house .
you'll adore dame olga , and her two daughters .
she'll make a wonderful mother .
well , a motherlike figure .
look , i'm sure you'll all be the best of friends .
whoa !
ls this the right address?
there must be some mistake .
my dear , welcome .
and these must be your lovely daughters .
my precious hattie and my special olive .
oh .
and you must be ella .
pleased to meet you .
yes .
the house looks delightful .
but i do seem to remember that at the noblemen's convention you said that you lived in a castle .
no , i said a man's home is his castle .
hi .
i'm ella .
welcome to frell .
what's with the prince pinups?
hattie's president of the prince char fan club .
char and his uncle are responsible for the segregation of the kingdom .
so?
he's dreamy .
ls this hutch meant to be a closet?
it's pathetic .
my clothes need more room than this .
we'll have to use yours .
wha ...?
show it to us .
oh .
it's so ... quaint .
almost like , well , it's just ugly , isn't it?
there's no room in here , either .
we're gonna have to throw out some of your gowns to make room .
wait .
get away from there !
you get away .
oh .
what's this?
i do actually like this .
please don't touch it .
it was my mother's .
can i have it?
no .
oh .
it can be your welcome gift to me .
come on , hand it over .
oh .
aren't you accommodating .
the second i sell the last of these , i'll be back .
i promise .
i know it's not a great job , not even a good job
ok , even a monkey could do it but we need the money , ella .
i'll miss you , father .
i'll miss you , too .
hey , olive , we should call her ella the smella from frella .
elves , giants , ogres and humans used to exist in harmony , but when king florian was killed , allegedly by an ogre ,
sir edgar saw it as an opportunity to exile all nonhuman creatures to the forest , keeping their land for himself .
passionately put , ella .
give yourself a pat on the back .
hattie?
oh .
what my unworthy opponent fails to realize is sir edgar has done a fantastic job .
he has driven the ogres out , and he has put giants and elves to work as laborers and entertainers .
therefore , if it weren't for him , we wouldn't have today's thriving free enterprise system .
it's only free because we've enslaved the poor creatures and they work for nothing .
edgar is a monster , and i don't hold out much hope for his nephew , either .
well , that shows what you know , aka nothing .
prince char will be the greatest king ever .
right , girls?
yeah .
i wonder if my opponent has based her opinion on the prince's politics or how cute she thinks his butt is .
admit you're stupid and don't know what you're talking about .
i'm stupid and i don't know what i'm talking about .
ella?
anyway , in conclusion ...
hold your tongue , ella .
ella !
my tongue itches .
lf you're not going to take this seriously , i declare hattie the winner .
ya !
uncle , do i have to go to this mall opening?
as heir to the throne , it's your royal responsibility , char .
you are a public figure , after all .
yes , but you're the one in charge .
only for a little while longer .
your coronation is next week .
you need to be out there with the people , char .
yes , shaking hands and kissing babies .
exactly , heston .
so the people can learn to trust us .
what's not to trust?
nothing .
but while you've been away at school , char , the kingdom has been under siege .
ln your absence , the ogres have become impossible .
he's right .
even the giants have become more and more treacherous .
but the giants have always been peaceful .
the ogres were peaceful too , until they ripped your father to shreds .
and i promised your father , should anything happen to him ,
i would take care of you and the kingdom .
and , well , i've kept my promise , haven't l?
whoa !
likewise , you must keep your promise to the people .
now , let's put on a smile .
remember , image is everything .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
it's wonderful to be here in your charming town of ...
frell .
prince charmont and i ...
we want char !
we want char !
we want char !
we want char !
we want char !
now it is my great pleasure to welcome my nephew , prince charmont .
say no to ogrecide !
stop the giant land grab !
say no to ogrecide !
stop the giant land grab !
say no to ogrecide !
stop the giant land grab !
say no to ogrecide !
ella !
you are embarrassing us !
go home now .
i have to go .
i'm sorry .
i love you , prince char !
hey !
prince char !
are you a fast runner?
not particularly , no .
why?
get him !
d i'm walking on sunshine d whoa oh d i'm walking on sunshine d whoa oh
ow !
shush , shush , shush !
d and don't it feel good?
prince charmont .
please , call me ... call me char .
sorry about that .
occupational hazard .
allow me .
i don't need your chivalry , thanks .
and i've no intention of curtsying , either , so forget it .
you can curtsy or not .
that's your choice .
there's really nothing i can do about it .
except have you beheaded , but that seems a bit extreme .
charming .
why don't you do what your people usually do?
steal my land and destroy my livelihood .
lf you'll excuse me ...
wait a second .
come back here .
hm?
what is your name?
ella of frell .
well , ella of frell , you're the first maiden i've met who hasn't swooned at the sight of me .
then maybe i've done you some good .
look , i've never stolen anyone's land or livelihood .
i want peace in the kingdom as much as anyone .
so you have a new plan once you take the crown?
well ...
sort of .
of course , i couldn't reveal it to a subject .
that's what i thought .
you're all just the same .
you care more about your fan club and your next jousting tournament .
no , actually , i've never been comfortable with the whole adoring fan club thing .
perhaps that's why i find your obvious disdain for me so refreshing .
obvious?
and i was trying so hard to hide it .
where's my purse?
it's back there .
wait right there .
i will get it .
prince charmont !
prince charmont !
your highness .
are you crazy?
why didn't you move?
i would have ... were it not for your apparent fascination with knocking me to the ground .
that's the second time today , you realize .
i'll try and be more considerate next time i'm saving you .
next time?
what makes you think we'll see each other again?
well , won't we?
no .
ella of frell , you are not like other girls .
you have no idea .
ella , come here .
shouldn't you be at home cleaning the fireplace , huh?
stop flirting with him .
it's me he's going to have at his coronation .
yeah , in the middle of the table with an apple in your mouth .
go back to the mall with olive .
ella .
oh .
don't bother with her .
ugh .
i'm the one you want .
i know everything about you .
i've got posters of you , and pictures .
and when we used to live in lamia ,
i used to stand outside your castle and watch you turn your lights on and off .
tell ella i'll be in touch .
right .
i'll see to that .
where were you?
oh .
i met the prince .
you met the prince?
i don't wanna talk about it .
olive and hattie were there .
hattie .
why do you always do what hattie tells you to do?
i don't .
yes , you do .
i don't .
tell the truth .
oh , i do .
olive , have you noticed anything strange about ella?
no , not really .
have you noticed it gets darker at night , then lighter when the sun comes up?
that's because of ella?
never mind .
you've been acting odd , even for you .
what do you mean?
oh ...
don't let her see me .
that's what i mean .
aha .
areida , no !
ella , come here .
i have to go .
what?
i need you to do me a little favor .
take that .
cool !
let me try !
take that .
and that potion bottle .
ok !
ok , that's enough .
i think that's for me to say , ella .
we need one more thing .
take those .
please don't make me do this .
well , since you said please ...
no .
take them .
take them !
run !
stop that girl !
buy a squirrel sandwich .
get 'em while they're hot .
here .
keep the change .
excuse me .
excuse me .
coming through .
try our new perfume .
thanks .
get out of the way !
get out of the way !
ella , bravo !
freeze !
put your hands together .
you're under arrest .
a felon in my own family .
i could die from embarrassment .
promises , promises .
you are a disgrace .
maybe she was put up to it .
mandy's right , mother .
we were there .
it really wasn't poor ella's fault at all .
she was forced to do it .
so , ella , who put you up to it?
tell her it was areida .
ar ...
i'm waiting .
tell me who's to blame .
areida .
areida !
i might have guessed it .
you are forbidden ever to see her again .
what?
ella?
how dare she come here now?
answer the door and tell her that you never want to see her again .
and tell her you could never be friends with an ayorthian .
dame olga , there must be some mistake .
please , dame olga .
don't argue .
just do it .
thank goodness you're all right .
what's wrong?
i never wanna see you again .
ha ha .
very funny .
i don't understand .
we're best friends .
i could never be friends with an ayorthian .
just go .
i've done terrible things before , mandy , but this is the worst thing the curse has ever made me do .
i've gotta do it .
i have got to find lucinda and get her to take back the curse .
you're right .
i have something to show you .
this is gonna help you find her .
i should have told you about this years ago .
but i was a little embarrassed .
embarrassed?
how?
well , as you know , i'm not the most talented fairy .
anyway , this book ... is my boyfriend , benny .
hey .
pleased to meet you .
pleased to meet anyone , quite frankly .
you're the first introduction i've had in 20 years .
i've never seen anything like this .
i know .
no one has .
and i don't want them to , cos then they might take him away .
it was an accident .
i was just trying a spell to trim his hair , and it went a little askew .
i would have left her ages ago , except i love her so darn much .
plus , i have no legs .
i love you , too , my little pooky pages .
not as much as i love you , cuddlebuns .
i love you more .
ok .
lots of love .
moving on .
well , i want you to take him with you .
you mean i'm getting out of here?
beyond these four walls?
there are so many places in my pages i've been wanting to visit .
wow .
what is all this?
he knows everything .
thanks , sweetie , but not everything .
lf i did , i'd be a lot thicker .
can he show me anything about lucinda?
can i show you anything about lucinda?
watch this .
show me lucinda .
ta da !
cool trick .
now , which crockery barn?
they're all over the kingdom .
ah .
that's the glitch .
he can't tell you where a person is .
he can just show you pictures .
like a crystal ball or a magic mirror .
everything is so huge .
ls that a wedding registry?
duh !
they're in giantville .
look , she's going to a wedding in giantville .
benny , we're going to giantville .
how exciting .
ella , the girls and i need bouquets for our portrait sitting tomorrow .
go and pick some .
d what you want , baby , i got it d what you need , cos you know i got it d all i'm asking is for a little respect when you get home , baby
oh , my god !
so , as her stepfamily scratched their newly found itches ,
ella was off , glad to be rid of the ... witches .
benny , can you show me a map of the forest of pim?
of course .
whoa .
according to this map , if we head due east towards monster rock , we can cut half a day off our journey .
what was that?
probably something that wants to eat us .
ouch !
somebody help me !
wait a minute .
sing soprano , little man !
missed !
what do you think you're doing to that poor elf?
oh .
who's this who thinks she's so tough?
look , i think it's only fair to warn you that i'm practiced in the ancient art ... of origami .
paper folding?
i was hoping you wouldn't know what that was .
don't let him scare you , sweetheart !
kick his butt !
don't let her do that .
now rabbit punch .
combo .
kneel .
front step kick .
dragon roundhouse kick .
this chick is nuts !
let's get outta here .
i think i'm gonna puke .
let me help you with that .
i am gonna need so much therapy after this .
oh !
are you ok?
no , i am not ok !
i think i broke something , or dislocated it , or ...
no , just a crick .
slannen of pim .
ella of frell .
nice to meet you .
well , if you're ok , then i have to be going , but good luck .
you're going?
you can't walk in this wood on your own .
how about a bite to eat?
that's very sweet , but i'm on a tight schedule .
fine .
message received , miss " i think i'm all that " .
that's not what i meant at all .
i extend the hand of friendship ...
i am on a tight schedule .
were i not ...
everybody's busy ...
.. l would love to have dinner with you .
great !
i've got a coupon .
slannen .
lf this is where you live , why are we sneaking around?
lf they spot you , you'll be sorry .
you know how all elves are forced to sing and dance?
yeah .
so?
visitors !

one , two , three , four !
run for it !
d let us entertain you , let us make you smile d let us give you a few tricks , some old and then some new tricks d we're very versatile d and if you're real good we'll make you feel good d we want your spirits high

i said get lost ! d we'll have a real good time
leave us alone !
peace and quiet at last . d jeremiah was a bullfrog d he was a good friend of mine
hit the road . d hit the road , jack , and don't you ...
get outta here !
i need this .
what is this , anyway?
ella's secret diary .
yes .
why don't you like music?
that's right .
because elves are supposed to be so happy and joyful all the time .
singing and dancing for the man .
i don't wanna be an entertainer .
i wanna be a ...
what?
nothing .
what were you gonna say?
it's silly .
please tell me .
i wanna be a lawyer .
i guess in small claims court .
what is that?
nothing .
why can't you be a lawyer?
hello?
elf .
i forgot .
the elfin restrictions sir edgar passed .
no elf shall be engaged in any occupation other than singing , juggling andlor tomfoolery .
they're never gonna let me go to law school .
i'm never gonna get my day in court , never gonna stand in front of the judge and say
you're out of order !
permission to approach the bench?
" i object !
no , i object .
i heard it there .
it's coming from the book .
no , it's not .
yes , it is .
no , it's not .
great .
i knew it .
a talking book .
good .
because for a minute there , i thought i was going crazy . d crazy d i'm crazy for feeling so lonely
what are you doing with ella's things?
just a little tidying up .
what's that?
what?
nothing .
it's personal .
a letter for ella?
the prince's coronation ball .
he's invited that insolent little snip?
girls , go and dust off your ball gowns and pack your bags .
i think i may have found you another chance at your future husband .
yes !
so you can really show me anything anywhere in the kingdom?
you're kind of like a walking , talking encyclopedia , except for the walking part .
come on .
what?
what's going on?
edgar's soldiers rounding up elfin singers to perform at the coronation .
get in .
and you .
slannen , you've gotta go to lamia and petition the prince .
for what?
to go to law school .
you gotta stop this . d the sun will shine you want me to go to lamia on my own?
we're going to giantville .
it's on the way .
come with us .
the prince will never grant an audience with an elf .
they think we're a joke .
i have met prince charmont , and i think he might be different than his uncle .
why?
cos he's a hunk?
no .
what is he , about six foot?
about .
yeah , i hate the guy already .
i'm not wasting my time .
lacking courage as well as height .
count me in .
elves aren't that short , you know .
that's just a myth created by that stupid elves and the shoemaker story .
do i look small enough to fit in a shoe?
no .
stinking grimm brothers .
are you sure he knows where he's going?
hey , i'm right here .
just cos i'm a book doesn't mean i don't have ears .
boys , if you can't play nice , you can't play together .
oh , no .
the rustling always comes before the screaming and the running .
i knew this was gonna happen .
they'll just find pieces of us scattered across the forest floor .
oh , a bunny .
you know , the last known case of a bunny attack was , well , never .
it never hurts to be on your guard .
nobody panic , nobody panic .
i've got this in hand .
oi !
you !
thumper !
out of the forest or no more carrots for you .
i don't like carrots .
how do you feel about rabbits , cos one just went thataway .
i am the ogre , nish .
how do you like to be eaten?
baked , boiled , shish kebabbed?
how about free range?
stop !
no !
ella of frell .
hi , how are you doing?
i think there's been a big mistake here .
see , i'm pro ogre .
pro ogre?
absolutely .
i led a rally on your behalf the other day .
maybe you heard about it .
it'll only hurt for a moment , i promise .
i'm a fast eater .
slannen , slannen !
please , i want to help .
help?
from a human?
humans took everything from us .
i was an ogre of leisure , with a simple life .
next thing you know ...
now , not this again .
nish , hurry up .
i'm starving .
right , you , into the pot .
forget that .
who are you?
i am the ogre , nish .
we just did this .
didn't we just do this?
all right , that's enough fun and games .
now , keep your mouth shut and don't move .
ls it boiling yet?
it's not gonna boil if you stand there looking at it .
you couldn't show a picture of a big ogre heading our way?
that would have been helpful .
oh !
oh !
i think i see bubbles .
let her go !
untie yourself .
truce !
truce !
can't we just get along?
are you one of the monsters who killed my father?
king florian was a good man .
we lived in peace during his reign .
why would we kill him?
i'll spare your lives where you didn't spare his .
you take your friends and find breakfast elsewhere .
we'll pick up something else on the way .
anyway , you eat maiden , an hour later you're hungry again .
what are you doing here , with an elf for protection?
do you get a kick out of near death experiences?
no .
i was fine .
i had things well in hand .
i could see that , as you were dangling over the boiling cauldron , no doubt lulling the ogres into a false sense of security .
who's to say it wouldn't have worked if you hadn't come barging in?
i see the score currently stands at chivalry two , gratitude zero .
look ...
you're right .
i'm sorry .
thank you .
you're welcome .
you're bleeding .
hm?
oh , it's just a scratch .
you'd better let me help you with that .
so , will i live?
i think the odds are in your favor .
so ... where were you headed?
the giants 'village for a wedding .
i'm meeting my godmother .
that's on our way back to lamia .
we'll accompany you .
that's not necessary .
it makes it so much easier rescuing you if i don't have to commute .
i'm so glad i was here for this interesting development .
look , i really appreciate the offer , but ...
are you crazy?
tell him to come with us .
come with us .
so , traveling with an elf?
your boyfriend couldn't make it?
no .
oh .
because i don't have one .
oh .
your girlfriend doesn't mind being left alone?
i don't have a girlfriend .
oh?
i have many .
oh .
i'm kidding .
shouldn't believe everything you read in medieval teen .
excuse me .
excuse me .
prince charmont , permission to speak?
sure .
you know the word coincidence?
it just so happens i was on my way to meet a certain royal someone in order to discuss some career options currently unavailable to ...
slannen wants to petition the kingdom for the right to become a lawyer .
a lawyer?
why not?
there were no laws against it when your father was king .
that's not really my area of expertise .
my advice to you would be to talk to my uncle .
i'm sure if you make a good argument , he'll come round .
well , thank you for your ... advice .
what?
you're about to become king .
you'll have the power to make a difference in the world and you don't even care .
it's not like i asked to become king .
i've had no say in the matter .
well , thanks to your uncle , there are a lot of people who have no say in the matter .
nobody should be forced to do things they don't wanna do .
take it from somebody who knows .
ella !
ella !
you're not finished yet .
you work until sundown .
the giants have always been gentle .
why are they treated like slaves?
i'm sure my uncle doesn't know about this .
he couldn't .
maybe you can get to the bottom of this at the wedding .
maybe you can find your godmother .
whoa .
they're not so bad .
i thought they'd be all so big and scary .
didn't hurt .
i hope this is a good idea .
they must hate the royal family .
they'll respect your courage at showing up here .
besides , they don't hold grudges .
they're bigger than that .
prince charmont .
what are you doing here?
no grudges , eh?
well , i thought that maybe this would be a good time to possibly have a heart to heart .
but now i'm thinking i should come back when there's been a little less drinking .
he's here as a friend to hear your complaints .
then welcome .
i'm looking for someone .
my godmother , lucinda .
she was over there earlier .
thank you .
i'll be right back .
excuse me . ls lucinda perriweather here?
too late , sweetheart .
she left about an hour ago .
do you know where i can find her?
last i heard , she was somewhere living in lamia .
do you know where the bathroom is?
benny , show me lucinda .
looks like she's getting an fwl .
fwl?
flying while intoxicated .
she could be anywhere .
ow !
sorry .
agh !
ooh .
i'd no idea things were so bad .
i promise , first thing after my coronation , i'll help you buy your farms back .
i'll hold you to that .
i'm sorry to interrupt .
no problem .
we were done .
that's a fine young man you have here .
he's not fine .
i mean , mine .
he is fine ...
never mind .
so have you seen slannen?
we have to leave .
my godmother's on some kind of bender .
you can't leave now .
it's the middle of the night .
you have to stay for the party .
ok , i'll stay .
i appreciate your enthusiasm , but you don't have to stay .
i don't wanna make you do anything you don't wanna do .
thank you , char .
for everything .
so i'll see you around?
but i wish you would stay .
i guess one more night wouldn't hurt .
mmm .
yuck .
so you're looking for your godmother lucinda?
she was supposed to be here , and now i have no idea where she is , and i need to find her as soon as possible bec ...
because i miss her .
ok .
did you think of trying the hall of records?
no .
we have every year's census in the castle .
it's not open to everyone , but i could probably pull a few strings .
char , i can't tell you what that would mean to me .
well , then , it's settled .
you come with me to lamia tomorrow .
ok .

they're after me .
who?
the giants .
they want me to sing .
i don't sing !

well , how about you , then?

i love singers .
really?
because , you know , being an elf , i love to sing .
you know , i hope you don't mind me saying this , but you're much prettier than i would have expected .
oh , i know .
giants are supposed to be big , ugly and mean .
it's because of stories like jack and the beanstalk .
stinking grimm brothers .
i've seen weirder couples .
none that immediately come to mind , but still .
my stepsister hattie would die if she knew i was here .
she's the president of your fan club , you know .
oh , hattie , yes .
thank you .
now i know what name to put on the restraining order .
no , you're lucky .
i wish i had brothers and sisters .
my mother passed away before she had any more children and ...
my mother passed away , too .
oh .
you know , she used to sing me to sleep every night .
my father used to sing to me , loudly and very off key , but ...
i still miss him .
i have edgar , i guess .
he's not such a bad guy .
he risked his life to save my father .
and he brought me up as his own son .
i know you don't like his politics much , but i'm sure when i tell him about the giants , he will correct the situation .
yeah , or you could .
it took a lot of guts for you to come here .
look at the way you smoothed things over .
you're a natural at this .
wow , is that almost a compliment?
almost .
now , don't go getting a big head .
your crown won't fit .
you know what else?
tomorrow i'm gonna go to my uncle and i'm gonna ask him to repeal the elfin restrictions .
slannen will have his day in court , if i have anything to say about it .
i think you're gonna be a great king someday .
your father would have been proud .
thanks .
i think he would have really liked you .
kiss me .
that wasn't an order , you know .
i know .
i want to look 25 at tonight's ball .
what do you suggest?
a time machine?
may i recommend our newest procedure?
bat faeces and oxen blood .
batox .
works wonders , although i do caution you , some people have a temporarily bad reaction .
olga .
peter , what are you doing here?
i'm in town on business and heard you were here .
i came to see ella .
ls ella here?
of course .
where else would she be?
she's ... she's ... with hattie and olive , taking a tour of the castle .
next we move into the castle lobby .
i can't believe it .
prince char walked on this actual floor !
ladies , ladies , ladies !
stop tonguing the foyer .
show us where char showers .
i bet he showers naked !
hold it , pipsqueak .
i'm with the prince .
and i'm not that short .
are you singing at the coronation?
heck , no .
no elves in the palace unless they're performing .
discrimination . lntentional infliction of ...
whoa !
.. bodily harm .
these portraits were recently commissioned in honor of tomorrow's coronation .
right , follow me .
what are they doing here?
i don't mean to rush , but now i really need to find my godmother , and slannen , too .
where is he?
my uncle'll send the guards to find him .
everything's gonna be fine .
don't forget , you are with the future king .
char .
hello , uncle .
i've been looking all over for you .
and who might this charming young lady be?
this is ella .
ella of frell .
ella , this is my uncle edgar .
and this is his ...
heston .
hey .
so , i trust your journey was pleasant?
we had a little run in with some ogres , but char got the best of them .
you could have been killed .
ah , well .
one just has to grin and bear it , i always say .
grin and bear it .
so , char , might i trouble you for a moment?
the crown maker needs to see you in your chambers for a fitting .
sure .
i just have to take ella to the ... to the hall of records .
yes , well , hop to it , then , both of you .
you were right about that girl .
very odd .
and i'm afraid she's been filling our prince's head with dangerous new thoughts .
here's the latest census .
names are listed first by location then species .
good luck .
thank you .
sorry i couldn't be of more help , but i don't have a census .
i mean , look at the size of that thing .
i do have a restaurant guide .
lucinda , i hope you're in here .
ella has lots of interesting opinions about the kingdom , uncle .
you should hear them .
i can't wait .
the giants 'working conditions , for instance .
they're unbelievable .
luckily , i've talked to them and they're definitely open for negotiation .
the only negotiations between me and the giants will be over our vegetable deliveries .
good one , sire .
this isn't a joke , uncle edgar .
we'll talk about it after your coronation , yes?
fine , but we will talk .
of course .
i ...
i'm going to ask her to marry me .
who?
this ... this ella of frell?
yes .
tonight , at the ball .
at the same time and in the same place as my father proposed to my mother .
get off !
do you know who i am?
come with me .
what now?
get off !
get off me !
so , ella of frell is your sister .
stepsister , actually .
really?
tell me , what do you know about her?
what's in it for me?
how about that your eyeballs remain inside your head?
now , now , heston .
we like these girls .
they're our friends .
i can't find anything in any of these books .
benny , show me lucinda .
no , still sacked out .
i don't know where else to ...
dun flyin retirement community for faeries?
why don't we just cut to the chase , hm?
i might even be willing to throw prince char into the deal .
let's see , now .
after the coronation he'll need to take a queen , and shall we say ... his hand in marriage?
queen olive .
for the eldest daughter , of course .
ella does everything she's told .
i don't know why , but she does .
she can't help it .
lucinda perriweather ,
dun flyin retirement community for faeries , lamia heights .
benny !
benny , we got her .
hello , ella .
i hope you've found everything to your satisfaction?
yes , thank you .
good , good .
oh , dear .
how clumsy of me .
pick it up .
very good .
now touch your toes .
oh , no .
oh , yes .
and while you're about it , why don't you pat your head and rub your tummy at the same time?
now jump up and down .
please stop .
wait .
perhaps you know this one . d put your left foot in , your left foot out d put your left foot in and shake it all about d shake , shake , shake , shake , shake , shake d shake your booty , shake your booty
this is fabulous !
hate to be a party pooper , but , edgar , evil plans , remember?
yes , you're right .
ok , stop .
as you know , tonight is the coronation ball .
at some point , amidst your frolicking and romancing ,
prince char will sweep you away to the hall of mirrors .
then , just before midnight , he will take you by the hand and ask you a question .
how do you know all this?
we know everything , my dear .
and the one thing we know with most certainty is that at the stroke of midnight you will take this dagger and plunge it through his heart and kill him .
no !
no , i won't !
oh , yes , you will .
you will , because i order you to .
actually , it's lucky you're here , so i won't have to do it myself .
you'd kill your own nephew?
why not?
i killed my own brother .
what?
why?
i want to be king .
duh !
now go .
wait .
there's one more thing .
you will tell no one of this plan .
can i help you?
i'm looking for lucinda perriweather .
it's kind of urgent .
sorry .
she was kicked out last week .
do you know where i could find her?
nope .
you don't understand . lf i don't find her , something terrible's going to happen .
finding her would be something terrible .
dear char .
this is the hardest thing i've ever had to do , and i hope you'll understand .
we can't be together .
i can't tell you why .
please believe that this is the only solution .
i wish you the best .
i really do believe you're going to be a great king .
goodbye for ever .
ella .
now , if she stayed clear of the prince until midnight had passed , then char would be safe .
but how long could that last?
slannen , where have you been?
what are you doing?
never mind .
this may sound strange , but there's something i need you to do .
you are one freaky chick .
i need you to go back into the forest and rally all the elves and giants you can find .
you want me to go back in there?
you'll need all the help you can get .
someone has to get into the castle , find benny and keep char away from edgar .
why?
what's going on?
i already told you , i can't tell you .
but if you don't , you might very well be stuck singing " kumbaya " the rest of your life .
fine ! lnto the forest of certain death walks slannen .
thank you .
yeah , whatever .
where's your little friend?
yes .
she should be here by now .
i don't want to talk about her .
agh !
oh !
oh !
oh !
slannen , please hurry .
would you stop that?
when you steal from here , you are stealing from me now .
what do you mean?
this is my future home , isn't it?
oh .
hi .
i was just polishing ...
would you ... would you care to dance?
are you kidding?
that's all she ever talks about .
you wanted to look younger .
lf you spent less time on your face and more on your maternal duties , we'd know where ella was right now .
ouch !
whoa !
what the ...?
this isn't the salad bar at brelly's .
lucinda .
lucinda !
lucinda !
oh , my goodness .
do i know you , child?
ella of frell .
you gave me a gift .
oh , yes .
i remember you .
the obedient one .
i am so happy to see you .
i have been looking everywhere for you .
i need you to take the gift back .
take it back?
i don't think so .
it's not that i'm not grateful for the gift .
i am , really .
but because of the gift ,
i'm about to do something horrible to this guy i really like and might even love .
girl , you out of your mind .
everybody loves my gifts .
lucinda !
lucinda , i am begging you .
i will do anything you ask .
please take it back .
you don't like my gift?
fine .
get rid of it yourself .
don't blame me for your problems .
did i chain your butt up to this tree , huh?
well ...
huh?
but you ...
no .
and , in fact , just to prove what a gem i am ...
i'll unchain you .
what?
no !
no !
aren't i fabulous?
now , look at you .
a pretty girl like you should be at the ball .
what?
go get down with the prince .
no , i can't go !
well , not dressed like that .
now , that's what i'm talking about .
ok , that hurt .
give , give , give .
you're welcome .
tell me about your sister .
olive? ldiot .
no , ella .
oh .
i don't wanna talk about her .
she's so dreary .
i just wanna talk about us .
us?
it sounds even more wonderful when you say it .
ow !
something tells me she just couldn't stay away .
we need to talk .
char , please ...
please tell me you never wanna see me again .
i will if you tell me that you don't love me .
it's not that .
then why did you write me that letter?
tell me how you really feel about me .
i love you .
but i am wrong for you , char .
i am wrong for the kingdom .
ls that what this is about?
ella , that's crazy .
come with me .
the hall of mirrors?
when i was little , my father brought me in here .
he told me to look in the mirror and see myself as a great leader .
somehow , i never could .
and then you come along .
ella , what's wrong?
i wish i could tell you .
i wish i could tell you everything .
these last few days have been so perfect .
well , except for the bit where we almost got eaten by ogres .
and you wrote me a letter that ripped my heart out .
and i had to dance with hattie .
but none of these things matter .
we're together now .
and when we're together , it's like magic .
i never want it to end .
i know , i know .
and i feel the same , but ...
that's why i brought you here .
char , please listen to me .
ella , i know .
you're scared .
i'm scared , too .
this is ... this is a big step .
ella ...
ella of frell , will you marry me?
no , no , no , no , no !
no?
no .
i don't understand .
what is it?
my politics?
your family?
because those things aren't important .
what's important is what's in our hearts .
lf our love is strong , we can conquer anything .
i do love you , char .
ella , come here .
don't argue .
just do it .
take that .
keep your mouth shut .
take those .
don't move .
on the stroke of midnight you will take this dagger and plunge it through his heart and kill him .
what's inside you is stronger than any spell .
you will no longer be obedient .
you will no longer be obedient !
i'm free .
i can't believe it .
i'm free .
you tried to kill me .
guards !
no , char ...
take her away .
no , char , please .
please , char , wait .
no , char !
char , please , wait .
i can explain !
please listen to me !
char !
no , please .
no !
no !
there's been a huge mistake .
please .
just listen .
please !
you realize , of course , she'll have to be put to death immediately .
i just don't understand .
maybe i should go and talk to her .
no .
no , i forbid you to go down there .
your highness , your uncle didn't want to frighten you , but the secret police informed us of a possible uprising .
those ogres in the forest , they were after you .
the girl was obviously part of the scheme .
the ogres never planned to hurt her .
she was just toying with your emotions , char , so she could get close to you and commit the murder herself .
i ...
i just don't believe it .
yes .
yes , it does seem quite fantastic .
you let me worry about all this , hm?
you just concentrate on tomorrow's coronation .
sire , you know i've been working with the red guard .
why not call them in now and take over the whole kingdom like we planned?
first we must find a way to get rid of the prince .
and i think i have a pretty good idea how to do it .
all right .
we just have to find a way to get past those guards .
help !
please , somebody get me out of here !
benny?
what's he doing here?
ugh !
slannen , you've saved my life .
are you ok?
i could kiss you .
i think a nice thank you note is enough .
i think ella's in trouble .
something to do with edgar .
we have to find her .
show me ella .
edgar's done this?
we've gotta go in there and stop him .
it'll take courage , bravery ...
i was gonna ask you how you'd like to be eaten , but if it's edgar you're after ... count us in .
welcome aboard .
executioner coming through .
enter .
help .
i wouldn't do that if i were you .
open up .
i'm miss frell's legal representation .
her what?
her lawyer , numbskull .
lf the gauntlet doesn't fit , you must acquit .
now , open this door before i sue you for everything you own .
now , move it !
come on !
come on !
thank you .
slannen of pim is not an elf easily drawn into a legal battle , but when faced with a challenge to equality , freedom and civil liberties , this elf will draw the sword of justice .
and , furthermore ...
excuse me , what is going on here?
well , can we at least take him to go?
put the nice man down .
slannen?
ella?
ella !
slannen !
oh , ella !
benny !
are you ok?
i'm fine , but char might not be .
show me edgar .
that's char's crown .
he's poisoned it .
we gotta go .
come on .
come on , guys .
we got a coronation to crash .
people of lamia .
today is a very special day for our kingdom .
for today you are here to witness the crowning of a king .
bring in the crown .
drop that crown !
ella?
seize them !
it's payback time .
charge !
char !
kill them , and anyone who gets in your way .
oh , my god !
no !
no , no , no , no !
i can't believe i'm saving you , after you tried to kill me .
i didn't try to kill you .
you get away from her !
take this !
hey !
that dagger you were about to plunge into my back was an early wedding present?
hello !
help !
mandy !
help !
fairies in kingdoms across the land , please help me turn benny back into a man .
a pumpkin?
ok , maybe i did try to kill you , but that wasn't me .
what?
maybe it was me , but it wasn't my fault .
then edgar found out about the curse and he ordered me to kill you .
so i had to break up with you , even though i'm pretty sure that you're the best thing that's ever happened to me .
that crown he's about to put on your head , it's poisoned .
duck .
whoa .
edgar's trying to kill me?
yes .
hold on .
how vulgar !
excuse me .
thank you .
char , there's one more thing .
he killed your father .
what?
that can't be true .
well , of course it's not true .
who are you gonna believe?
this lying little twit , or the man who raised you?
he tried to kill char !
get him !
uh oh .
well , i guess that answers that question .
you vile little girl .
i should have disposed of you when i had the chance .
you almost destroyed this kingdom .
you killed my father , your own brother .
how could you?
how could l?
i wanted something , he was in my way , i got rid of him .
he wasn't fit to wear this crown , and you're not fit to wear this crown .
this crown is mine .
this kingdom is ...
oops .
we won't be needing that .
you saved my life .
then we're even .
ella !
ella , stop kissing him !
you are never to kiss him again .
you wanna bet?
marry me?
now , that i'll do .
ah !
i now pronounce you husband and wife .
to a nation of equals .
to my good friends .
and to my true love , ella .
so , such is the story of ella of frell , a spunky young woman once under a spell .
