you fool .
no man can kill me .
die now .
i am no man .
fifteen !
sixteen !
seventeen !
twenty nine !
legolas !
thirty three , thirty four .
that still only counts as one !
all right , then .
come on !
i know your face ... ...
owyn .
my eyes darken .
no .
no .
i am going to save you .
you already did .
owyn ... ... my body is broken .
you have to let me go .
i go to my fathers ... ... in whose mighty company ... ...
i shall not now feel ashamed .
owyn .
release us .
bad idea .
very handy in a tight spot , these lads , despite the fact they're dead .
you gave us your word .
i hold your oath fulfilled .
go .
be at peace .
merry .
merry , it's me .
it's pippin .
i knew you'd find me .
yes .
are you going to leave me?
no , merry .
i'm going to look after you .
hands off !
that shiny shirt , that's mine .
it's going to the great eye , along with everything else .
i don't take orders from stinking morgul rats !
you touch it , and i'll stick this blade in your gut .
the scum tried to knife me .
kill him !
that's for frodo !
and for the shire !
and that's for my old gaffer !
stop your squealing , you dunghill rat .
i'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig .
not if i stick you first .
sam !
oh , sam , i'm so sorry .
sorry for everything .
let's get you out of here .
it's too late .
it's over .
they've taken it .
sam ... ... they took the ring .
begging your pardon , but they haven't .
i thought i'd lost you .
so i took it .
only for safekeeping .
give it to me .
give me the ring , sam .
sam .
give me the ring .
you must understand .
the ring is my burden .
it will destroy you , sam .
come on , mr. frodo .
we best find you some clothes .
you can't go walking through mordor in naught but your skin .
we did it , mr. frodo .
we made it to mordor .
there are so many of them .
we'll never get through unseen .
it's him , the eye .
we have to go in there , mr. frodo .
there's nothing for it .
come on .
let's just make it down the hill for starters .
frodo has passed beyond my sight .
the darkness is deepening .
if sauron had the ring , we would know it .
it's only a matter of time .
he has suffered a defeat , yes ... ... but behind the walls of mordor , our enemy is regrouping .
let him stay there .
let him rot !
why should we care?
because 10, 000 orcs now stand between frodo and mount doom .
i've sent him to his death .
no .
there is still hope for frodo .
he needs time and safe passage across the plains of gorgoroth .
we can give him that .
how?
draw out sauron's armies .
empty his lands .
then we gather our full strength and march on the black gate .
we cannot achieve victory through strength of arms .
not for ourselves .
but we can give frodo his chance if we keep sauron's eye fixed upon us .
keep him blind to all else that moves .
a diversion .
sauron will suspect a trap .
he will not take the bait .
certainty of death ... ... small chance of success ... ... what are we waiting for?
to the gate , you slugs !
move it !
to the gate !
look , the orcs ... ... they're moving off .
you see , mr. frodo ... ... some luck at last .
take mine .
there's a few drops left .
there will be none left for the return journey .
i don't think there will be a return journey , mr. frodo .
frodo , get down !
hide !
frodo !
where are they?
let the lord of the black land come forth !
let justice be done upon him !
fall back .
fall back !
it's gone , mr. frodo .
the light's passed on , away towards the north .
something's drawn its gaze .
hold your ground !
hold your ground .
sons of gondor , of rohan , my brothers !
i see in your eyes ... ... the same fear that would take the heart of me .
a day may come when the courage of men fails ... ... when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship .
but it is not this day .
an hour of wolves and shattered shields ... ... when the age of men comes crashing down .
but it is not this day .
this day we fight !
by all that you hold dear on this good earth ... ...
i bid you stand , men of the west !
never thought i'd die fighting side by side with an elf .
what about side by side with a friend?
aye .
i could do that .
do you remember the shire , mr. frodo?
it'll be spring soon .
and the orchards will be in blossom .
and the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket .
and they'll be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields ... ... and eating the first of the strawberries with cream .
do you remember the taste of strawberries?
no , sam .
i can't recall the taste of food ... ... nor the sound of water ... ... nor the touch of grass .
i'm ... ... naked in the dark .
there's ...
there's nothing .
no veil between me and the wheel of fire .
i can see him ... ... with my waking eyes .
then let us be rid of it ... ... once and for all .
come on , mr. frodo .
i can't carry it for you ... ... but i can carry you .
come on !
aragorn .
elessar .
for frodo .
look , mr. frodo .
a doorway .
we're almost there .
clever hobbits to climb so high !
frodo !
eagles .
the eagles are coming !
frodo !
i'm here , sam .
destroy it !
go on !
now !
throw it in the fire !
what are you waiting for?
just let it go !
the ring is mine .
no .
no .
no !
yes !
yes !
precious !
precious !
precious !
precious !
give me your hand !
take my hand !
no !
don't you let go .
don't let go .
reach !
frodo !
frodo !
it's gone .
it's done .
yes , mr. frodo .
it's over now .
i can see the shire .
the brandywine river .
bag end .
gandalf's fireworks .
the lights in the party tree .
rosie cotton dancing .
she had ribbons in her hair .
if ever i was to marry someone ... ... it would've been her .
it would've been her .
i'm glad to be with you , samwise gamgee ...
... here at the end of all things .
gandalf?
frodo !
gimli !
now come the days of the king .
may they be blessed .
this day does not belong to one man ... ... but to all .
let us together rebuild this world ... ... that we may share in the days of peace .
my friends ...
... you bow to no one .
and thus it was .
a fourth age of mlddle earth began .
and the fellowshlp of the rlng ... ... though eternally bound by frlendshlp and love ... ... was ended .
thlrteen months to the day slnce gandalf sent us on our long journey ... ... we found ourselves looklng upon a famillar slght .
we were home .
hi .
hey , watch the pumpkin .
rosie , rosie .
good night , lads .
how do you plck up the threads of an old ilfe?
how do you go on ... ... when in your heart you begln to understand ... ... there is no golng back?
there are some thlngs that tlme cannot mend ... ... some hurts that go too deep ... ... that have taken hold .
mr. frodo?
what is it?
it's been four years to the day since weathertop , sam .
it's never really healed .
a hobblt's tale by bilbo baggins .
and the lord of the rlngs by frodo baggins .
you finished it .
not quite .
there's room for a little more .
bilbo once told me hls part in thls tale would end ... ... that each of us must come and go in the telilng .
bilbo 's story was now over .
there would be no more journeys for hlm ... ... save one .
tell me again , lad , where are we going?
to the harbor , bilbo .
the elves have accorded you a special honor ... ... a place on the last ship to leave middle earth .
frodo ... ... any chance of seeing that old ring of mine again?
the one i gave you .
sorry , uncle .
i'm afraid i lost it .
oh .
pity .
i should like to have held it one last time .
well , here's a sight i have never seen before .
the power of the three rings is ended .
the time has come ... ... for the dominion of men .
i think i'm ... ... quite ready for another adventure .
farewell ... ... my brave hobbits .
my work is now finished .
here at last , on the shores of the sea ... ... comes the end of our fellowship .
i will not say , " do not weep " ... ... for not all tears are an evil .
it is time , frodo .
what does he mean?
we set out to save the shire , sam .
and it has been saved .
but not for me .
you don't mean that .
you can't leave .
the last pages are for you , sam .
you cannot always be torn in two .
you will have to be one and whole for many years .
you have so much to enjoy and to be and to do .
your part in the story will go on .
well ... ...
i'm back .
lay down
your sweet and weary head
nlght is falilng
you have come to journey's end
sleep now
and dream o f the ones who came before
they are calilng
from across the dlstant shore
why do you weep?
what are these tears u pon your face?
soon you will see
all of your fears will pass away
safe in my arms
you're only sleeplng
what can you see
o n the horlzon?
why do the whlte gulls
call?
across the sea
a pale moon rlses
the shlps have come
to carry you home
and all will turn
to silver glass
a ilght on the water
all souls pass
hope fades
into the world of nlght
through shadows falilng
o ut of memory and tlme
don 't say
we have come now to the end
whlte shores are calilng
you and i will meet agaln
and you'll be here in my arms
just sleeplng
what can you see
o n the horlzon?
why do the whlte gulls
call?
across the sea
a pale moon rlses
the shlps have come
to carry you home
and all will turn
to silver glass
a ilght on the water
grey shlps pass
into the west
