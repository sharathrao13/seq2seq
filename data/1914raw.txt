natalino sapegno , history of ... " who's that?
he's my italian teacher .

and is he going to test you?
no , his assistants will .
assistants?
do they know who you are?
like they care , dad ...
the " messaggero " published a composition of yours !
this mr. sapegno has to test you personally .
when he sees how smart you are , maybe he'll help you win some scholarship , so you can go abroad .
i can come with you i'll speak to him .
what?
you want to speak to mr. sapegno?
of course , i'm not ashamed !
but i am .
well , i was just trying to help .
when are you leaving to norway?

they're the experts there .
dad?

that's great , we needed a break .
i'll leave the door open as we'll be right back .
nicola , have you got the keys?
yes .

it needs tying up , right?
yes i'll take care of it .

carlo , i wanted to ask you for something , because if i ask nicola he won't reply to me .
do you know matteo well?
of course .
tell me then , what's wrong with him?
what do you mean?
i mean he's always angry .
come on , let's go study !
we were talking !
you're always talking ...
oh , wait a minute , i've got something for you .
i've had it in the car for a week .
where did you get it?
i traded for it .
what should i do with it?
you're a student in medicine , maybe you'll need it .
how are you , mate?
quite well .
but in case of a turning point in the situation , so to speak , can i use your holiday home?
the holiday home is a great idea !
don't even think about it !
what?
that house is perfect !
perfect?
last time you used it you made such a mess that my mother's still crying !
not again please !
yes again please .
enough !
by the way , i spoke with my father .
and?
and he'll lend us the car !
great !
this is good news !
did you tell him we're going to cape north?
i told him it's an educational journey around europe .
so we'll leave after the exams?
yes , only we can't push the engine over 4, 000 revolutions .
so?
are you coming to carlo's holiday home?
you and i?
yes .
alone?
of course .
it's beautiful , the sand is golden , it's full of " tamarix aphilla " , and flying dolphins ...
it's beautiful , and i love you .
you're always kidding nicola .
no , i'm serious !
i love you , i swear .
come on , let's dance .
did you ask your dad about that job?
you must be at the clinic on monday morning .
do you have the address?
it's called " speech therapy
you only have to take our patient for a walk , and chat with her to help her feel " normal " .
you don't have to make friends with her , it's just a therapy .
giorgia has been well for a while now , so we need you only twice a week .
follow me .
there she is .
you'll see it's easier than walking a dog .
what's your name?
what's your name?
what's your name?
giorgia , don't speak to people you don't know .
what's your name?
matteo .
mad matteo , madly mad matteo ...
watch out !
don't touch me !
i won't touch you , but watch out .
look left then right .
go .
do you like it here?
i come here often .
it soothes my nerves .
and there are no cars ...
there's a beautiful place here .
would you like to see it?
would you?
when i've had enough of studying at home i come here .
i like it here .
at this hour it's almost desert too .
shall we read something?
yes .
trains .
trains?
trains what?
what time they leave or arrive ...
oh , the timetable .
there's no timetable here , sorry .
but there's a book i'd like to read to you , a book of poems .
wait , where's ... ... american literature?
it's not easy to cover the percentage of life ..
she deals the cards to catch you in weakness , not in full strength .
she gives you 70 years to play .
if you can't in 70 years , you can no more .
leave the room if you lose .
leave when your time's over .
only cowards stay and hang on to the cards .
hey , look out !
mind the cars !
oh my god !
hey , careful !
what are you doing?
don't touch me !
i'm not touching you .
fuck you !
i won't touch you but you want to be run over !
idiot , cockhead , shitface !
listen , do you know what death is?
asshole !
no , you're an asshole !
fuck you !
no fuck you !
are you crazy?
okay let's go now .
to the clinic .
you don't like me?
you can stay there .
you only have to say it .
here you are .
come on !
so it's normal , but what am i supposed to do?
nothing , you don't have to react .
if you stay quiet she'll calm down .
but , professor ...
call me by name , please ...
alright .
but maybe i did something wrong?
no , you didn't , my dear .
it's her disease's fault , not yours .
but that's what we're for .
hey , is it ready?
did you wash it?
i never ask them to wash my car .
they like it .
it's their pastime .
but you can't mortgage this house !
this is your children's house ...
to mortgage a house is a normal thing .
the problem is that you're from milan .
you are extraordinary people ,
you're intelligent ...
what's that supposed to mean?
and so you lack imagination . ability to dream .
sure , imagination ...
chicca?
what are you doing still up?
come here .
how long have they been fighting?
since the film ended .
and did it and well?
yes .
he was a king and he didn't know , then he knew it and married the princess .
that's bad .
why?
because then they'll fight like mom and dad .
you must promise me that when you grow old you'll never get married .
i want to marry you .
and nicola too .
you can't marry your brothers , especially two of them together .
so ...
let's put alice to bed and make them stop . ... if you have a head on your shoulders .
hey people ...
will you stop it please?
hey , will you stop it?
what are you doing here?
poor thing , you're still up .
how could she sleep with all that noise?
tell me , what should i do?
leave matteo be , don't involve him in this .
you and nicola must defend me against your father .
what?
matteo , am i a bad father?
yes , wanna know what the good father did?
he mortgaged his house .
you mortgaged this house?
no , the palace of caserta .
of course , i own this house here !
did you understand?
if his job ends badly we'll go to sleep under a bridge .
under a bridge !
matteo , that's cool !
oh , finally someone who loves adventure !
sure , we'll live like tramps under a bridge .
but who cares of how his job ends?
you're insane too !
he's right , not insane !
leave it all to me .
i'm the head of the family .
what does that mean?
it means i know when i can invest money .
you have to beat competition , understand?
and then , i can smell a good deal .
you smell good deals?
i thought that you could smell a fart !
go , go ...
what a pity i can't ask for divorce in this country .
divorce?
like the american ladies?
yes like that .
well , see you .
you're going out again?
yes , nicola and the others are waiting for me .
where are you going?
around .
girls?
who knows ...
where is she?
with a client , i think .
shall we wait here?
yes this is her fire .
it's a bit embarrassing .
it's not .
she'll be here soon .
is that her?
yes .
what's happening?
hi cati .
hi matteo .
who was that?
who are those?
my brother and two friends .
hi .
hi .
so , shall we go to your place?
come in .
can i leave the light on?
so the hens think it's day and they'll eat .
it's okay .
don't you get undressed?
are you ashamed?
understood .
i'll turn around .
look , maybe it's better if we do nothing .
but i'll pay you all the same .
are you sick?
no , i'm not , but ...
i don't know .
maybe ...
come on .
listen , are you matteo's brother?
yes , why?
because you two are different .
you aren't like him .
really?
why , what's he like?
he's weird .
well , anyway ...
let's do it quick or you'll make me waste too much time .
no .
don't kiss my lips .
hi giorgia .
why are you staying here in the dark?
don't you want to go out?
everyone's in the garden .
can i take some pictures of you?
the light is perfect .
come on , look at me .
well?
alright , i'll photograph your hands .
your hands are pretty , did you know that?
what's that?
what did they do to you?
please read and comment on this page .
it's a poem by sennuccio del bene .
i know , but what does it suggest to you?
nothing .
nothing?
why?
because it's empty .
sennuccio del bene is empty too .
then give me an example of a religious poet you like in particular .
il beccaio .
are you kidding me?
il beccaio , is a modest imitator of cecco angiolieri , and can't be considered as one of the religious rhymers .
he curses his father and his mother .
is that a religious poet?
i think so .
well , i don't , and i know a little more than you .
what are you doing?
i got annoyed .
yes those marks were left by electrical discharges .
she was electroshocked .
where did you take the picture?
isn't the electroshock forbidden?
unfortunately no .
who's that girl?
i'll tell you later .
go study now .
isn't your exam tomorrow?
yes .
wish me good luck .
the teacher is a tough one .
i wish i got full marks like you .
full marks ...
are you coming with carlo and berto tomorrow?
so we can leave as soon as i've failed?
no , come and take me from " the hole " .
i'm going to sleep there .
with whom?
hi antonio .
hey , most illustrious one , why here so late?
sorry , i forgot a book in the hall upstairs .
i can't move from here .
don't worry , i'll go get it .
if you wake them up , you'll entertain them .
esposti giorgia , pietracamela " .
giorgia?
giorgia , wake up .
wake up , giorgia .
don't be afraid , it's matteo .
listen to me carefully .
now you take all your stuff and we'll leave .
i'll take you away .
you deserved 28 or 29 , but i'm giving you 30 because of what i call
sympathy quotient
it's not much , but it's enough to make you get 30 .
someone disagrees with this quotient thing of mine , but i think that sympathy , from the greek word " sympazein " which means " share the pathos " , or other people's sufferings , is very important for a doctor .
to others i apply the " antipathy quotient " .
it means i lower their marks .
antipathy is the worst thing for a doctor .
i think you are praiseworthy , congratulations .
but don't get big headed .
you have to do two more exams with me ,
i can still tear you to pieces .
who are those?
friends of yours?
did you take the claque with you?
no .
well ... we have to leave together , so ...
they came here to ...
are they in my class?
i can't remember them ..
ahem , no .
carlo studies economics , berto philosophy .
don't tell me the story of their lives .
i'm just happy to know they'll cause damage somewhere else .
economics , philosophy .
wow !
as i said , you're promising .
and i may be wrong , but i want to give you a piece of advice .
if you're you somehow ambitious , leave .
leave italy .
leave italy as quickly as you can .
do you want to be a surgeon?
i still don't know .
whatever you decide , go to study in london or paris .
go to america if you can , but leave this country .
italy should be destroyed .
it's a beautiful and useless place , destined to die .
you mean the doomsday is about to come?
i wish .
we would be forced to rebuild all if it did , while everything remains motionless instead , in the hands of the dinosaurs .
listen to me , go away .
why are you staying though?
me?
my dear , because i'm one of the dinosaurs .
move aside please .
aside , aside , we're leaving !
i had thirty !
how can you have 30 at your first exam !
you're sick !
so , matteo's in " the hole "?
yes .
drive faster !
i can't .
4, 000 revolutions , remember?
yes but 4, 000 ...
come on , 4, 000 !
4, 000 my foot !
weeeeee !
faster !
giorgia?
giorgia !
wake up , it's time to go .
i made you some coffee .
sugar?
one , two?
no sugar?
... i understand if he was referring to your specialisation ,
but i don't think that going abroad to find a job can ...
so you think we'll all find a job in italy?
yes , our yearly growth is at 7 % and unemployment is at 3 % .
what does it mean?
it means things are going well because unemployment increases when growth goes below 4 % .
you mean that will be begged to work?
no , that's a bit too much , also because within the next few years plenty of people will graduate .
inflation should increase a little .
so to speak , natural selection will take place .
let's say that out of 3 graduated people , one won't find any job .
basically the dumbest of the three .
hey now , why don't you all go to ...
i think we should take the " statale appenninica " .
sure , so we'll need 20 days to reach turin .
okay but girls don't hitchhike on the highway .
he fixed his mind on that !
on what?
but where's matteo?
i have no idea .
you should go and check .
okay , i'll get the keys and ...
oh , there he is , finally .
who's that?
i don't know her .
he was supposed to come alone?
i don't know anything .
wait here , please .
we said no girlfriends !
let's hear what he has to say before .
maybe she isn't coming with us .
that girl looks strange .
there's something about her .
who's she?
the girl in the pictures?
but what's the problem?
nothing , it's a delicate matter .
and?
see you at the brennero .
did you go crazy?
are you joking?
we were supposed to be at the brennero by night .
we'll be a day behind now .
calm down .
we'll never get to hamburg .
calm down .
see you at the customs in two days .
it's because of her?
yes , because of her .
did she run away from home?
kind of .
where are you going?
we'll take you there .
no , we'll take care of it .
okay then , good trip !
you too .
good trip .
see you .
good trip .
don't go too fast , okay?
i won't .
i don't know , when i saw how bad she felt i thought ...
you did the right thing .
and that matter of the electroshock too ...
you're right , it's horrible .
but we have to take her somewhere now .
her mom is dead .
her dad lives in a place called pietracamela .
pietracamela?
where is it?
i don't know , maybe in the appennino .
we could take her there , then leave .
alright .
giorgia?
come here .
see how strange she acts?
yes , but why?
she's nuts !
no she isn't .
she looks intelligent .
giorgia !
do you remember me?
how are you , giorgia?
my bishop forgets me , while you still love don vito , don't you?
look at you !
you're so pretty ...
who are those?
hello .
hello .
nicola .
vito .
matteo , nice to meet you .
what's the matter?
we're looking for giorgia's father .
he moved a few years ago .
he lives in ravenna now .
in ravenna?
yes , he moved there three or four years ago .
are you from the institute?
yes , from villa quieta .
and so young ...
good boys .
and how come you brought her here?
for summer holidays .
for summer .
she was confirmed like all the others , because children are all the same for me .
aren't they , giorgi '?
do you remember ...
lord , i'm not worthy of you , but just say a word and my soul will be saved .
she's so pretty .
very good !
as a child she knew the angel's prayer .
but the word of god was nothing serious for her .
so it is for many other people .
you're right .
what's your name again?
matteo .
and yours?
nicola .
good boy , nico '
maybe it was her mother's death .
she died when giorgia was a child , and she kind of became obsessed .
she cleaned everything , over an over again .
she cleaned her room , the kitchen , the stable ...
who knows why .
what time is the next bus to ravenna?
it's just left !
if you only said it earlier ..
there's another one at 7 a . m . which arrives in the afternoon .
tomorrow morning?
we must leave immediately .
immediately?
that cannot be .
it's impossible .
what are we going to do now?
you could stay at my place .
i have a kind of ... not a stable , a depot .
better than a poke in the eye , or a kick in the face !
isn't it?
for you madam , here's the royal suite .
you can lay down on this wonderful bed .
there's also a fantastic spar so you can have your privacy , separated from the two heroes , ajax and achilles .
there's also a beautiful blanket , by kind concession of the clergy .
so if you're cold you can put it on .
but i'm not getting undressed .
i'm not .
that's fine .
you know what?
i won't get undressed too .
okay , let's get some sleep now .
giorgia ...
tomorrow you'll sleep in a real bed in your father's house .
i don't have a father .
i don't .
give me that !
thief !
give me that , bastard asshole !
you're a thief !
a thief !
let go of it !
it's mine !
giorgia !
come inside !
leave me be !
leave you be?
leave me be !
leave me be !
leave me be !
thief !
thief !
look ...
i'm not a thief !
you are !
sorry , i didn't know it was yours .
you're a thief !
i found it on the floor !
enough !
what's wrong?
nothing , i took a noteb
but i didn't know it was hers !
go away !
you have to go away !
leave it to me .
giorgia , let's go inside , it's raining .
enough !
come on , we're getting wet here .
let's go back inside , please .
maybe you better wear something dry .
i'll give you something mine .
do you like it?
put it on .
are you ashamed?
you can go behind the curtain .
come on .
next time you want to shower , just let me know , and i'll book you a room at the grand hotel .
done?
how long does it take?
the buttons ...
may i?
yes .
i'll help you .
buttons are the hardest thing .
shoelaces too , but buttons are really complicated .
imagine if don vito comes in now .
he would curse us and we'd go to hell .
you have a beautiful smile .
you're good , see?
let's sleep now .
let's go to beddy byes .
shall i turn off the light?
no .
no no .
alright , lights on .
good night .
what happened?
nothing .
good morning madam .
excuse me ...
good morning .
do you know where mr. saro lives?
he lives here , he's my husband .
where is he now?
what's wrong?
nothing , it's a personal matter .
aren't you giorgia?
you should have been in the institute .
and who are those?
fatty ...
giorgia ...
what are you doing here?
what happened?
we don't think the institute is the right place for her .
what?
she is ill treated there .
and when she has a crisis they electroshock her .
electroshock?
yes .
and what's that?
electric discharges .
aren't they painful?
they are .
i pay a lot of money to the institute so she can recover and be well ...
why don't you keep her with you instead?
i can't , i have other children .
then keep her in the family with her siblings .
they aren't her siblings , they're rosa's kids .
rosa loves you , and they do as well , but you don't get along with them .
in fact
i put you in that clinic hoping for you to feel well , and recover your health .
giorgia , now these people will take you back to the clinic .
why don't you try to take her with you?
they'll take you back so you'll be fine .
giorgia doesn't need a doctor .
she needs a father .
i am a father !
i love you giorgia , you know that .
then show her you do .
take her to your house .
i cannot do that !
life's expensive nowadays ,
i already spend a lot for the clinic ...
money's nothing to do with her .
she needs love .
we love her !
but ...
she feels awful , i know that !
hey i'm not forced to speak about my family
with two strangers !
what kind of father are you?
and who the hell are you?
she's your daughter !
she's my daughter so she's none of your business !
none of my business?
hey calm down !
calm down !
stop it now !
damn you !
where are we going now?
i don't know .
you should think twice before hitting her father !
she can come with us .
with us where?
to the appointment with carlo and berto .
and what about the customs?
where's her passport?
you should use your head sometimes !
are you hungry?
no .
you don't eat or drink .
do you live on air?
and stop that  leave her alone !
she cut herself .
come on , get a towel !
what if she cut her vein?
come on ...
maybe we should take her to the er .
there's no need for that .
get a towel please .
this is the cheyenne method .
drooling dew
what happened?
nothing , we broke a glass .
korea scored .
who cares?
in fact we couldn't care less .
less than nothing .
on the contrary , i'm a fan of korea .
ko re a !
ko re a !
bye .
bye .
wait for me here then .
what will you tell giovanna?
i'll tell her that we got a problem after leaving .
but what if she asks why carlo and berto aren't with us?
trust me , okay?
i don't trust my sister .
she could send us to jail .
that's why i'm going alone .
what about us?
think of something .
there's a bar , have something to drink ...
i'll leave my bags here , okay?
see you .
bye .
do you want something to drink?
okay , you're mad at me .
you don't speak to me ...
give me a sign then .
say " yes " or " no " .
was that " yes "?
hello .
hello , can i help you?
what would you like?
hey !
giorgia?
you want to listen to something?
what's your favourite?
elvis?
sandy show?
what's " achi "?
oh , " a chi " , fausto leali .
let me see ...
here .
b 3 .
your friend berto did something serious .
she is under her father's jurisdiction and he decides for her .
there's nothing i can do .
it's the law .
but berto thought she would be killed in that clinic .
then he could have filed a complaint .
that's what the magistracy's for .
he seized a person , not a knick knack .
do you ever deal with such cases?
no , i'm dealing with that .
you won't believe me , but thousands of people work there .
so lots of problems?
the usual job suits , dismissals , diseases , accidents ...
i've an embarrassing wide choice .
plants never stop here .
they're on 24/ 7 , all year .
that's why the sea and the sky changed colour .
the leadership says it's all under control , but last week they distributed this .
toothpaste?
yes , but they advised for teeth to be brushed before meals , not after .
understand?
not really .
it means that the powder on their teeth and gums is toxic .
and it causes cancer in the long run .
listen , it's not berto's problem but yours , right?
no , it's matteo's instead .
he always gets in trouble .
no , i promise you it's berto's .
why don't you call the psychiatric hospital in gorizia?
there are wonderful doctors there .
they may be wonderful , but it's still an asylum .
but their patients aren't tied up or electroshocked .
what if we take her here?
i am forced to report you to the local attorney .
they come here , get the girl , and take her back to her father .
clear?
how long till the train leaves?
half an hour .
listen , why don't you go and buy three " zatterini "?
me?
yes , you .
no , i can't .
why?
you've got legs , haven't you?
i'll do it .
no , she will .
come on , three " zatterini " .
i can't do it .
you can , it's easy .
hi miss .
three " zatterini " .
three " zatterini " .
do you think we should really take her to gorizia?
i think so .
giovanna said it's a good hospital .
and if we don't like the doctors , she'll spend the holidays with us .
in sicily .
here you are .
your change .
wait , miss .
your change .
hello .
hello guys .
two coffees please .
sure .
miss , you left your change .
take it .
he's asking you to take your change ...
do you know her?
no , i've never seen her before .
is anything wrong?
i don't know , she left her change here .
i called her , but ...
i see .
are you with someone?
no , i'm alone .
do you carry any documents?
she isn't answering .
let's take her with us .
come with us .
what about her bag?
i don't know ..
what's going to happen to her?
i don't know .
maybe she'll be taken back to the institute .
is it possible that there's nothing we can do?
look , let's catch our train tomorrow .
let's go on with our journey .
alright .
let's have some rest now .
matteo , what are you doing?
my journey's over .
over?
what do you mean?
i'm going to rome .
to rome?
why?

dear matteo ,
i'm sending this letter to mom and dad so that they can give it to you .
where are you?
did you hear from carlo and berto?
i never met them ,
i travelled alone .
by the way here i am .
norway is a wonderful place .
people are particularly striking .
martin , for example , is american , and he's a deserter .
he left america because he didn't want to go to vietnam ,
holy ...
the world is holy .
the soul is holy .
the tongue , the cock , and hand
and asshole are holy .
who wrote that?
a genius .
what's their name?
allen ginsberg .
savages ...
i left my companions and i'm heading north .
you won't believe me , but i am in front of a small wooden church a few steps from a stone which says that the polar arctic circle line passes through here .
right now my fellow students are having lesson with the old dinosaur , but i don't feel guilty ,
i don't feel like i'm wasting my time .
dear beast ,
i've something important to tell you .
i'll never shave or a have a haircut again .
i'm sending you a picture to show you how i look .
pretty , aren't i?
what the hell are you doing?
... i don't like games , clear?
don't play with me !
calm down !
don't break my balls !
he's a weirdo .
he's crazy !
how are you?
he hurt me .
my money's gone , so i'll look for a job in some local sawmill .
they pay workers well and need workers all the time .
girls are beautiful here , serene ... without turning serious as italian girls do when one pays them a compliment .
faster !
keep your butts down !
you wanna get killed?
you're a bunch of queers !
faster , or you'll do it again and again !
come on , animals !
i'm gonna break your ass !
nicola carati .

i have to call mom , she's no one to help her .
dad is sick , i was the only one who worked .
i need to know if ...
attention !
what are you doing?
i don't want to go out !
fine .
you won't go out tomorrow and the day after tomorrow too !
the confined ones stay here .
all the others out !
sometimes i think of giorgia . ... of the fact we couldn't protect her .
maybe when i'm back i'll become a psychiatrist .
we must do something for people like her .
they mustn't be electroshocked .
you're great , matteo .
you made fun of the lieutenant .
but you're strange .
you had him confine you for three days .
and you could have found a better excuse .
that's the truth .
i am unemployed , i want to make a military career .
didn't you say you're the only one with a job?
that's the only lie i told .
you should make a career here too .
are you nuts?
you can become a general .
hurry up !
faster !
come on !
faster !
nicola !
attention !
five minutes break then we'll start .
stand at ease !

nicola !

yes , no problem sir .
then pezzuco's following me .
alright .
what was that?
it's called " stecca " .
my god !
you never did military service , did you?
i don't even want to !
do you want to be a tramp?
i saved lots of money
working as a woodcutter .
good .
i'm not going back to rome .
and what about university?
i'll enroll somewhere else .
after what i saw around europe
i can't keep on living with mom and dad .
when will you be done with the army?
never .
what do you mean?
i'm making a career .
where?
i want to be a policeman .
are you kidding me?
no .
you'll be a policeman?
i will .
you went nuts !
come on , you believed that?
you were kidding?
come on , nicola ...
look !
who knows what it used to be ...
it's a miniated manuscript in latin .
let me get a torch .
in 1126 a. d. , the light ...
no , " the first light .
" the first light of day came ...
i can't remember that verb .
" came and alighted
came and alighted on the head of the blessed one .

i can't believe it !
carlo !
berto !

i'm the " good savage
more like a woodcutter .
exactly !
you made us wait in bolzano for two days !
three days !
you weren't there when i arrived .
liar !
i called your mom .
she said you were in hamburg .
let's go get some food !
i took two exams all alone .
i failed three exams all alone !
let me see .
i think ... "?
" therefore i am !
see , you're good !
why didn't you write at least?
it was a wild place .
no stamps .
yeah sure ...
what about girls?
no girls?
don't place it there .
i was told to ...
no , their place is over there . follow me .
make up your minds ...
... mind the step there , or the bottles will br very good .
our soldiers came here to help us .
give them some bread .
and wine too .
how cute .
enough .
what are they doing?
look at their coats ...
those are lorenzo the magnificent's nieces . ... covered with mud ...
he's amazing too .
looks like he came from a book by chekov ...
remember firs in " the cherry orchard "?
who's firs?
the old hunchback ...
never mind .
no , i remember . ... give him some bread too .
... good .
to these young men now .
good morning misses .
are you mocking them?
just joking ...
then it's fine .
give them some wine and bread too .
here .
who are those pretty girls?
marquis riccobaldi's kids .
we were lucky .
our house is on the hills , so it wasn't damaged .
and so the marquis sent his daughters ... to say thank you all .
how nice of him !
him?
i'm the one who's carrying the cart !
just kidding .
i've played the piano since i was 10 .
now i'm a maths 'student in turin .
what's maths got to do with the piano?
my mother chose the piano , i chose maths .
but why maths?
because i wanted to solve the famous problem of the jealous husbands .
what's that?
you don't know it?
no .
there are three married couples .
married?
yes .
how boring ...
they have to cross a river .
they only have a boat which can carry two people .
the jealous husbands don't want their wives to remain with the other men .
of course .
where's the riddle?
how do they cross the river?
it's easy .
so ...
two wives go first .
one gets back and takes her husband ... ... to the other side .
mind your own business .
she leaves him there , gets back and ...
no .
she leaves him there .
no .
two husbands go first ...
it's the same , isn't it?
i give up .
it's easy you said?
no , i'll solve it .
maybe another time .
okay .
once you've graduated , ... will you be a teacher or a pianist?
not a teacher .
not even a pianist , i think .
you know your business !
you must do both things .
sure ...
let's enrol in turin .
why?
turin?
he's crazy !
yes , he is .
berto , let's go to turin !
i won't graduate .
dad wants me to work in his factory .
don't laugh .

from oxford .
by the way don't call me a " terrone " anymore okay?
i am from turin .

look at him !
he can't even laugh .
it's easy for the police to face you sissies ...
shut up .
they should come to the factory .
we'd kick their asses !
fast !
yeah , kick them ...
you can't because of the labour unions .
don't involve the unions .
who writes this bullshit?
your friends?
did you read that?
we were given this yesterday .
alright , but ...
we must destroy the school , not change it .
you got it wrong .
listen .
i don't want to destroy schools .
i want a right to study ... ... for me who couldn't study , and for my children .
you have no children !

gigi !
how are you?
how strange to meet again here .
weren't you in treviso?
i was , but they needed help for the demonstration .
nice idea !
was it for self defence?
if they hadn't stopped me i would have killed him .
will you be tried now?
i don't know .
but i'll be transferred .
where to?
bologna .
i'm leaving tomorrow .
the boy you hurt will make it .
i don't give a damn .
do you want to keep behaving like that?
let's start over .
hi matteo .
how are you?
wanna come to my place?
i'll show you the house .
what do you need to get out of here?
gotta ask for 70 permissions to the minister of the interior?
gotta lick the floor where the head of police walked?
gotta pray st. michael , patron saint of the police?
i only need to sign some papers .
do it then !
this is the yard .
hello , " tota " bianco .
hello .
tota " means " miss " in dialect .
i'll buy a cake .
we gotta celebrate !
what?
i'll tell you later .
ay , my good sire?
light of my life !
you always forget the keys .
sorry love .
he's matteo .
hi .
hi .
come in .
thanks .
gigi is paralysed .
you met him during the flood in firenze .
remember?
of course .
we look like the same in our uniforms .
is he a friend of yours?
we're all friends .
that's bad !
really why?
because you're on the wrong side .
are you sure?
yes .
and which one's the right side?
the side of the poor?
exactly .
luigi knows what to be poor means .
he is poor !
those who hit him aren't .
are you?
that's nonsense !
i don't hit innocents !
but he's on the wheelchair , not you !
i can't stay here anymore .
giulia , please .
nice woman ...
i see you made friends .
we're celebrating our child's birth in september .
a child?
did you choose its name?
sara !
what if it's a boy?
giulia says it's a girl .
i trust her .
it's a nice name , from the bible .
is she playing?
yes .
she doesn't seem mean when she's playing .
she isn't mean .
she thinks she's always right .
exactly like you ...
sleep .
nicola !
does the baby have to sleep with us?
that's not good .
hush ...
sara , please go to the other room , will you?
cause daddy has a little thing to do with mommy .
go !
he could have come to pick us at least !
try to be kind , and don't say that to have kids when you have no job is crazy .
also because nicola has one .
only for six more months .
she works too .
yes , in a rubbish shop .
how can they buy clothes and miniskirts for sara?
isn't it early for miniskirts?
and don't mention the fact they aren't married .
no one gets married anymore !
why , you wouldn't marry me today?
you don't think it's good enough?
what are you saying !
ladder a
hi !
how are you?
fine .
the journey?
it was good .
open up please?
what's that?
an english baby carriage .
thanks !
it's beautiful !
here's the rest .
put it there .
hi .
this house is big .
we were lucky to find it .
was it so coloured?
no , i painted it .
congratulations !
she's sleeping .
hi ... she's so cute !
i'm grandma , and he's grandpa .
such a cute face ...
she's got my eyes and my chin .
you wish !
let her grow and we'll see .
she's bigger than the last time .
she is .
if someone told me i'd become grandpa ...
sara are you happy to have such a young grandad?
she's looking at me !
you conquered her .
where's nicola?
at the court .
what happened?
there's a trial against a sick psychiatrist .
nicola's there to help .
he must testify?
no , the patients will .
they were accepted as witnesses .
let's hope that the judge trusts them .
it would be the first time in italy .
no , in the world !
marino , when they say " swear to tell the truth " ...
you all listen , because you all will be asked for that .
i do " .
marino , repeat please .
i do .
good . otherwise they won't listen to you .
when did you first enter the mental hospital?
i was four ...
no you were 8 .
you must say that , okay?
yes , i was 8 , i liked to dress like a girl .
and they weren't supposed to shut you in .
when i see the " electrician " ,
i'll break his bones !
calm down !
you won't do that because you're good .
nicola !
you'll calm down .
promise me , aldo .
look me in the eye .
nicola?
will you stay calm?
nicola !
nicola !
yes , mario?
it looks like my cousin ignazio .
that's true !
where did you find those?
behind the statue .
don't pick up anything , please .
you all don't .
who brought them in?
swear to tell the truth .
they made us enter together .
they had us lay down on the lined up beds .
no !
you must say " i do " first .
i do .
eight years old .
10 times in the hospital .
10 times in the hospital .
the witness is playing a part someone taught him !
of course he needs to calm down a little .
mr. president ...
mr. levi , please say " i do " .
i do .
please go ahead .
when the electric doctor came into the room ...
i closed my eyes , but i could hear those besides me screaming .
four nurses blocked my hands and feet .
i felt a hand putting some rubber stuff inside my mouth .
then the first shock came .
once i escaped from the hospital , but they found me again .
they hit me hard then tied me up to the bed again .
and then the electrician with his machine came in .
while he shocked me , he shouted
tell me who helped you escape !
i didn't want to tell him .
so i pressed my jaws together ... so hard that i broke all my upper teeth .
giovanbattista , are you listening?
here's the record of your last deposition .
please repeat what you know here .
look at him .
is that the man you referred to?
can you speak?
you said ...
the doctor gave me electromassages because i drank .
did you say that?
i had 5 in 5 days
is that true?
five of them is normal for alcoholics .
shut up !
shut up !
you won't kill people anymore !
calm down .
if something like that happens again i'll clear the courtroom .
i apologise for aldo and for all the others .
they're upset , it's not easy for them to speak in tranquillity .
giovanbattista can't speak at all .
i know silence is no evidence , but it's all he has to give .
i hope he gets eight life sentences .
i'd be happy if he got a day .
it's a matter of principle .
why did dad come to turin?
he has a project and is looking for a sponsor .
he says we should pass from typing machines to don't know what , processors , computers ...
i don't know .
i have to tell you something .
he doesn't know i found them .
he won't tell me about it .
but he seems worried .
i never searched his drawers before .
you're a doctor .
can you do something?
no mom .
but the course of illness can be slackened by some medicine .
it could take years before ...
i know , i read everything i could find .
i read the same thing you said , that nothing can be done .
what are you doing?
i'm writing some notes for the trial .
you're a disaster , you type with two fingers !
let me type .
no , there's no need to .
please !
i want to help .
the lawyer said that the treatments weren't a punishment and also stated that homosexuality is a disease which needs curing .
why , isn't it a disease?
no dad , it isn't .
are you sure?
i am .
okay then i believe you .
what a piece of crap !
change the carriage at least !
it's good for me .
cut it out .
but it's out of fashion , a general change is needed .
i have an idea , i'm looking for a sponsor .
as a matter of fact , if you don't mind ,
i'd like to stay in turin for a while , to look for this sponsor .
there are many experts in mechanics here .
of course dad , it's good for you to get busy .
i thought you'd say i'm crazy as you mom does ...
no you aren't crazy , you look ahead , you already live in the future .
you aren't fit for this world .
and what about mom?
is she staying too?
no , she's leaving .
it's already strange that she left francesca alone for 4 days .
look , one of these days i'd like to go and see giovanna in milan .
i'll take a train .
no , i'll take you there .
don't bother , i can  it's fine , so i can also see carlo .
do you remember carlo?
of course i do .
isn't he teaching in england?
yes , he's only passing by .
so i can say hi to him .
i could tell him about my project .
in england there are business banks .
it's not like in italy .
maybe he knows someone .
okay , dictate .
what , are you playing?
you can't play with two six of flowers .
take them back .
sorry .
but i scored 40 points all the same .
you didn't .
count them .
come on .
3 times 6 makes 18 , 20 , 22 ...
see , you didn't reach 40 .
i didn't .
sorry .
adriana , listen .
yes?
as regards that thing that nowadays no one gets married ,
i think that nowadays
i would marry you .
my little thing .
did you find a house?
no .
there's a dormitory here , but no one wants to sleep in it .
it's fine with me .
i don't like houses .
why did you come here from the scientific section in bologna?
i didn't choose to .
they said you need people here .
but you could say " no " .
i never say " no " to orders .
what are you doing?
drop it , won't you?
what have you got in there?
books .
books?
yes , books .
you're a strange type .
i read your characteristic signs and what did i find there?
nothing
i found .
apart from some mess .
hot blooded , aren't you?
you're a fighter , right?
why did you join the police?
what were you looking for?
rules .
and what do you make of them?
i follow them .
do you?
yes .
i do what i'm told to .
then i mind my own business .
then you fit this place .
sicily is the home of those who mind their own business .
what?
he was shot in the head .
and there's a hole in his brain .
you live nearby .
commissary , we're done .
wait a minute , please .
so you found the body?
yes .
early morning?
yes .
what were you doing here so early?
i was pasturing the donkey .
oh , the donkey .
yes .
but the donkey found the body , or you did?
i did .
oh , you did .
and you touched it?
no .
good boy , you didn't have to .
but you looked at him .
who's that?
does he live here?
yes .
so you knew him?
did you know him or not?
i didn't .
you didn't?
if he lived here , you had to know him .
tell me the truth , come on .
did you recognise him?
did you know him?
i did .
good boy .
you knew him then .
and tell me , was he a good man?
he was .
those who knew him knew he was good .
a good man ...
but why do you say he was good , when others say he wasn't?
how do i know?
i know nothing of nothing .
right .
after a certain point you don't know anything anymore .
may the rats eat that bastard !
bastard ...
may he rest in peace .
bastard .
may he rest in peace , yes .
okay , i got it .
did you see?
please everyone show the due respect to the court .
whatever the verdict is ,
i don't want to hear any noise or comment .
the court , according to articles 483 and 488 of the code of criminal procedure , finds the defendant guilty of the crime he's accused of , and sentences him to 5 years 'imprisonment , and the payment of legal costs .
order !
order !
i must say i like these colours after getting used to them .
and these drawings are really nice .
congratulations .
listen ...
can i ask you for something?
sure .
there's a piano in the other room , why don't you ever play it?
i never play it because
i'm not good enough .
one can't be only a little good , so i decided to stop playing .
i didn't ask you why you don't play in front of an audience .
i meant why don't you play it here?
at home , for yourself .
for myself?
what's wrong?
i'm done .
why?
because i made lots of mistakes .
i didn't notice them .
you didn't , but i did .
but you're playing for me so they don't count .
ahead with this ravel , come on .
i like ravel .
do you ever ask her to play?
no .
why?
because i know she doesn't want to .
that's not true , she played the other day .
she did it for you .
it was a special thing .
you don't understand .
you're so smart and yet you don't get it .
women must be told they're good , that they're beautiful , that they're the best thing we have .
giulia play for me " .
play for the two of us " .
you should behave as i did with your mother .
what?
you fight all the time !
fights are good ,
they're good to keep fit .
the 26 principles and the 109 recommendations of the un approved in stockholm 2 years ago , are constantly disregarded in italy .
above all by people like those who are to be judged today , and for whom i ask for the maximum of the penalty .
i also ask for them to be charged of the legal costs and of the damage costs .
because they willingly discharged waste products to a river damaging the environment and the health of the citizens .
think of this : in the last ten years 1 . 870 billion dollars a year were spent for military purposes .
a year , understand?
now , 50 % of this money was spent for bribes , also in italy .
wouldn't you put them under arrest?
give me the names .
tell her about public enterprises .
what are you , a prompter?
no , she knows about those , as the names are in the papers too .
but she has to read them .
dad?
what ...
look .
old chopsticks .
dad?
" folk " .
okay , okay ...
don't listen to him .
this is the crab's technique .
sure , it's the calamari's .
i'll use the fork .
will your banger make it to the airport?
how dare you?
take a taxi then .
why are you going to cambridge?
there's much to do here too ...
i know , i'll be back .
i'm studying for a master .
then i think i'll be back next year .
i wanted to apply to the bank of italy .
didn't i tell you he wants to become a governor?
he wants to sign the banknotes .
let's drink to the future governor .
long live the governor !
long live the governor !
i know it sounds absurd , but if you want him to think he can make it , you must believe it too .
not just pretend .
but he doesn't know we know .
it doesn't matter .
it doesn't matter , your father can feel it . he can feel everything , he can feel it if you care .
he can feel you all .
carlo , i'm a doctor .
i can't believe in miracles .
then forget you're a doctor for a while .
okay , i understood .
you're my friend , you want to help , i understood .
thanks .
enough though .
sorry .
thanks .
thank you .
i think it's my plane .
sorry about before .
no , i'm sorry .
i talked nonsense .
try not to behave like an asshole in england .
try not to behave like an asshole here .
i didn't tell anyone .
not even nicola .
he would have started with psychology , with the fact that you need to react , all that bullshit , you know .
i told you ... because i told you .
this is our secret .
you must promise me , because i don't want anyone's pity .
but you must promise me you'll have yourself cured , and tested and so on .
i'll do everything .
be patient with matteo .
i don't know why , but i've never understood him .
and i'm sorry for that .
then there's francesca ... and mom , and nicola .
nicola is strong .
he isn't all the time .
he's like everyone else .
and last but not least you have to take care of yourself .
you have to smile .
be cheerful , have fun .
where's your husband?
out for work?
we haven't seen each other for a while .
there are some problems .
another woman?
not at all .
there are just some problems .
i think we'll ask for separation .
separation?
and you weren't telling me?
i'm sorry .
i'm not .
it's better this way .
it is !
we'll find another one .
are you looking for mystery?
are you talking to me?
you must find the soul .
how can i find it?
you have to search for it , look inside people .
palermo , summer of 1977
can you look inside?
i can .
see that child?
look at his hand .
he's confident .
he has a cockade on his shirt , he's top of the form .
maybe .
see that old lady?
two wedding rings , she's a widow .
and she feels lonely .
you aren't sicilian .
are you making fun of me?
did you see the film " stromboli "?
the one with ingrid bergman?
yes .
that's where i live .
but i'll leave soon .
i applied for a job as a librarian in palermo .
i want to leave the island .
what about that?
it's a professional camera .
are you an expert?
i'm an expert in libraries too .
are you?
i am .
so if i got the job , what library should i choose?
in palermo i don't know , but in rome there's a beautiful one in villa celli montana .
can i look for mystery?
come on ...
sorry i have to go .
now?
yes .
what's your name?
nicola .
mirella .
pleased to meet you .
sorry .
bye .
bye nicola .
what happened?
someone was killed .
the commissary wants you to take some photos .
i don't have the camera .
i do .
wow , you never forget anything , do you?
where did you find it?
look at me !
that's too easy .
look at daddy .
look at me .
i hurt myself .
how many times must i say sara must be in bed at this hour?
did the doctor prescribe that?
daddy's a doctor !
he can decide !
what's wrong?
i'm tired .
i fought with stefania .
i told her i'm done with the shop .
i've had enough of arguing all the time .
you used to like arguing .
i did once .
maybe it's better this way , so you can go back to play the piano .
i sold it .
someone will take it away tomorrow .
are you crazy?
maybe i am .
where have you been?
do you control me?
i went to a meeting of the collective .
anything against that?
those are really good people ...
what do you mean?
there's nothing decent in this country .
everything sucks .
and we do nothing about it .
did you hear of that boy who was killed in bologna?
yes , i did .
and when are we going to make them cry too?
when are we going to make them cry too?
take off that thing !
you're ridiculous !
listen ...
let go of me .
you can't even stand me now?
no !
i can't even stand you .
you only care for your hospital .
everything's on my shoulders .
i don't agree .
i hate arguments !
i hate fighting couples !
ladies and gentlemen?
ladies and gentlemen?
bobby can't sleep with this noise .
you're right , love .
we'll all stay quiet now .
dear carlo ,
i'm happy to hear of your success in cambridge .
here things are the same as usual .
it's not easy to work inside the institutions , trying to change them little by little .
giulia and i have got problems .
she became aggressive and hostile .
she's unsatisfied with something i can't understand .
we've slept like brother and sister for 6 months now .
follow me , i'll show you the dormitory .
who sends these inspectors , i wonder ...
the minister of health , madam .
true , the minister of health .
and who are you?
a lawyer?
a judge?
please open up .
i'm a psychiatrist .
good .
here's the dormitory .
as you see it's clean everything's tidy .
where are the patients?
i sent them to a trip to the sanctuary of europa , because i care for them .
i want them to feel well , to have fun .
to feel like normal people .
where are you going?
there's nothing there .
there's just a basement .
what's inside here?
nothing .
open the door .
there's just a store .
don't !
marshal , please ...
you must have a search warrant first !
i want to call my lawyer first !
come on !
where are you going?
see?
are you happy now?
there's nothing here .
only garbage .
where are you going?
you can't do that !
it's an empty room !
stand aside !
marshal , please .
i protest !
it's not fair !
take her to the radio car , and if she offers resistance , handcuff her .
the door .
... water ... water ...
call some ambulances .
untie them and cover them .
please marshal ...
giorgia?
now giorgia put on the sweater .
be good .
we'll give it to you and you'll wear it by yourself , okay?
here .
let's do this ,
i leave it here and we'll turn around .
please giorgia .
it's okay , i'll manage it .
thanks .
how are you?
did you eat?
do you want some?
remember the journey we took together?
don vito's village?
that time we slept in a hayloft .
do you remember the soccer match?
italy were losing and we laughed and laughed ...
do you remember matteo?
the orange .
it must drink or it'll die .
you're right .
i always forget it .
sorry , i won't touch you .
but i'd like you to come here every day ,
to water the plant , or it'll die .
the judge?
did you call him?
yes .
when?
two hours ago .
and he's still not here?
what?
you're smoking in a slaughterhouse?
please , put it out .
put it out !
we should leave ...
can we move it?
move it?
first the judge comes and then we move it .
always the same questions .
our shift's over .
the shift you said?
there's a dead man here !
enzo , what did i say?
tell them to keep quiet .
they don't want to !
force them !
okay , go away everyone .
please leave .
what?
there's a child here !
are you all nuts?
get out !
out !
are you his dad?
take him away !
is the child bothering you?
take him away !
who do you think you are?
how dare you?
do you think it's a nice show?
there's a dead man here !
it's not a film .
where were you when he was shot?
i don't know !
i don't remember , i wasn't here !
he doesn't know !
like the rest of you , nobody knows !
he died by himself !
and then show him to children too , so they can learn .
go away .
don't touch my son !
what are you teaching him?
you won't touch him !
here's an extraordinary permit .
i don't want to see you for 2 weeks .
go on holiday , go home , do as you please , but get lost .
i already have too many problems here .
what do you want to prove?
out of my sight !
get lost !
carati , what happened?
all's well .
but will you be transferred?
nah .
special leave .
that's how it works .
it could have been worse .
oh , here you are .
it arrived this morning .
dear matteo ,
i have good news .
i found giorgia .
i think she suffered a lot , but it seems as if time stopped for her .
i was very excited when i found her .
i remembered that summer of many years ago , when my life , yours , and many others 'changed .
and i thought why don't you leave the headquarter for a few days and come to see her in turin?
what took place in april wasn't an isolated phenomenon , it wasn't just an outbreak of violence , because it followed 50 days of fights at the flat , fights which involved a huge number of workers and blocked the whole production cycle , showing how much power the workers have on a political and organizational level .
i don't like it .
too bureaucratic .
there's a difference between desires and needs .
needs are a serious matter .
needs lead us to bring it all up for discussion , to risk everything , to die and fight , if necessary .
for example the need for communism ...
hi .
hi .
excuse me .
you came home earlier today .
yes , i did .
hi sara .
hi .
are you drawing?
yes .
let's go for a walk .
hurray !
enclosed space is not good for a child .
and for people's brains .
the need for communism ...
i need to drink , to eat ...
sara , when you hear this bullshit ...
you said a swearword !
sometimes one has to .
when someone lies to you at the kindergarten ,
what do you tell them?
shitty liar !
good !
now let's go out for a nice walk .
see ya'll !
see ya'll !
it's cold outside , so we take your coat with us .
let's go take a breath of air .
out , out ...
listen giulia ...
i know , it's a problem i have to solve .
hello .
luigi pezzuco please .
thanks .
i was lucky too , doctors always tell me that a few more millimetres and i would have lost my arms too .
everything works instead .
almost everything .
i even met a woman .
patrizia .
let me show you ...
i have a picture of us which someone took at a party .
it has to be here ...
here it is !
she's beautiful .
congratulations !
we'll get married in september .
we also want to have children .
you wanna know how we do it?
slowly , patiently .
she likes it all the same , she says .
of course .
but this was only possible thanks to your mother .
my mother?
matteo ...
i have a few notebooks like this one .
without your mother , this hand wouldn't have recovered .
did she come here?
once in every week .
you didn't know?
i did .
and not only my hand recovered .
also my brain .
i had never read poems before .
ettore , you'll be honoured with tears
shed where the holy blood you poured for your country lies ...
what did i write here?
till the sun shines on human misfortunes " .
doctor carati?
what a surprise !
how are you?
fine .
you?
fine .
the beard?
sara says it stings .
it stings?
yes so i shaved it .
i have a present for her .
thanks .
what's that?
a doll , so you can play too .
how nice !
did you pass through rome?
yes , but didn't stop at home .
what are those pictures?
my patients made them .
i'm organising an exposition .
are you?
yes .
did you know that mom went to help luigi ,
my colleague on the chair?
yes , i knew it .
who's that?
my master , franco basaglia .
the one who wants to set all the nuts free?
he has this strange feeling that mentally ill people aren't prisoners but human beings , and that mental illness isn't a crime to pay for .
weird guy , isn't he?
how is dad?
you should go see him .
i will .
i will .
i already made up my mind .
let's go see giorgia .
sure .
how is she?
better .
maybe we'll discharge her .
we do it as soon as possible , and place them in small houses .
what's wrong with them?
once they were all " schizophrenics
which means nothing .
it means they're like split in two ..
who isn't?
are you completely a policeman?
am i completely a doctor?
the truth is we don't know enough about the matter .
but one thing for sure they suffer from the " mental hospital disease " .
how do you cure them?
we open the departments .
i'll wait in my study .
you're leaving me?
what can i tell her?
maybe she'll tell you something .
hi giorgia .
it's very good to see you again .
are you well?
you're right , it's a stupid question .
what does it mean?
nicola said you can go out .
shall we go for an ice cream?
we'll look for a juke box too .
you used to like music .
i was also told you read .
you like books .
what do you read?
which words can reach your brain?
you can't hear me .
sound !
air !
attention !
nothing .
nothing can reach you .
you're absent minded .
absent !
like i didn't know already ...
do you remember that summer?
what were you like?
what was i like?
madly mad matteo ...
giorgia !
can she make it?
she will , you'll see .
she reminded me ...
once , at that station ...
yes?
we listened to the juke box .
she turned around and looked at me .
you were a bit in love with her ...
you were !
we both were .
what song was it?
" a chi " by fausto leali .
a chi !
a chi !
nicola !
your father ...
could you slow down?
slow down , no one's after us .
you wanna drive?
i just said to slow down .
that's how i drive !
fuck off !
giulia , please ...
i'm worried because of sara .
understand?
understand?
why don't you answer to her?
she spoke to you !
that's how i drive , giulia .
stop this fucking car !
stop it !
stop the car !
pull over !
okay , calm down .
i'll stop it as soon as i can .
what the hell are you doing?
turn around !
turn around !
matteo !
thanks for coming .
hi .
thanks .
how's your mother?
you can see it .
hi .
hi , i'm francesca .
policemen are busy .
but he said he would come .
he will , if he can .
but why don't you come with me to milan?
francesca can make it .
no , i have to stay because of my job .
i know the school will be ruined without you , but you have to take care of yourself .
in fact i do .
working helps me .
giulia?
coffee?
i'll go make some .
no , i will .
anyone wants a coffee?
yes thanks .
francesca , where's the coffee machine?
into the cupboard .
the other one .
nicola says you'll be minister of treasure in 10 years .
does he?
i'm currently working for the bank of italy .
to be a minister i should change career .
you mean?
it means ministers are politicians .
i'm only a technician .
you're modest .
nicola says you're smarter than him .
and if he says so ...
nicola is crazier than his patients .
that's true .
you're so clumsy !
what are you doing?
i've just finished high school .
i'll study literature .
i want to be an archaeologist and see the world too .
it's a good thing .
i am a middle distance racer .
i'm an excellent cook and play the violin too .
nothing else?
i get easily bored .
are you getting bored now?
no , i'm making coffee , making sweets with sara ,
and chatting with the bank of italy .
good .
it's something ...
aunt?
i'm coming .
see how many cookies i've made !
you're so good ...
want some more kneading?
can i have a cookie?
carlo , go away !
francesca is good with children .
i'm not .
i'm not good .
there isn't a single way to be a mother .
i wasn't a good mother to matteo .
at least i wasn't the mother he wanted .
no you were a great mother , i can see it in nicola .
excuse me .
i'll go get some milk .
there's some in the fridge .
there are many people .
it's not enough .
i'll go get some milk .
i got it .
can i get out of this house for a while?
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry love .
forgive me .
you're late .
there was trouble at home .
it's dangerous for me to wait here .
i have a suitcase , i have a suspicious air .
have you got the keys?
they're inside , with the money and the documents .
and the gun .
can you use it?
no .
you'll learn .
let me pass !
let me pass !
nicola , let me pass !
let me pass !
let me pass !
did you think of your daughter?
let me pass !
let me pass !
why?
let me pass !

they don't produce enough .
they're not competitive .
then what?
workers can't win .
it's his opinion .
it isn't , unfortunately .
but there are the unions !
they can't do anything .
people are scared , selfish .
carlo , they can't fire him like in 1800 !
industries are being re organised .
they cut the expenses to become competitive .
who cares !
i know .
should we pay for their incapacity?
who cares if the system blows up?
come on , the system won't blow up .
if it did , it should be replaced by something else .
any idea?
me?
you're the expert !
enough with fighting !
this is a happy day !
cut it out .
it's the " swan song " of workers !
in a few years no one will remember us .
don't worry doctor , they won't have me !
i won't stay at home and cry .
i'll look for another job .

this is the chief's office .
pay attention .
that's your office and here's the coffee machine .
this is your desk .
those are wanted , no political distinction .
we think they're all in town .
what if we meet this one for example?
if she tries to reach her pocket we'll shoot .
i'll shoot her even if she stays still .
just for precaution .
" the car has been found near there .
it was stolen 10 days ago .
it's sticky !
add some more flour to it .
" his 20 year old daughter has heard the shooting .
the attorney has died before reaching the hospital .
it's full of bubbles .
" a man has called saying
the red brigades forced him to call . " " ... a new claim for the terrorist attack ...
caccia was investigating terrorism , traffic in drugs ... " " ... and the mafia racket ...
i'd like to borrow this .
hello .
yes?
you're nicola .
the girl from stromboli !
i have a name .
wait , don't tell me !
give me a document in the meantime .
i forgot it .
marcella !
no , mirella .
true !
sorry .
i'll record it using my name , but bring it back in 15 days .
what if i steal it?
i'll look for you .
you don't know where i live , or my last name ...
i'll find you a second time .
okay .
did you come here because we spoke about it?
your advice was good , it's a beautiful place .
it's lunch break .
wanna share a sandwich and an apple?
i remember that day so clearly .
i even dream of you very often .
i told my boyfriend and he got jealous .
i don't know why , i was no longer sure you were real !
men are idiots .
that's true .
then if you tell him you met me he'll kill you !
he's that sort of man , yes , that's why i left him .
apple?
do you still take pictures?
sometimes .
remember when you told me i had to look for mystery?
i liked that a lot .
i tried , but never managed it .
i can't photograph people inside .
you said that !
did i?
i don't remember .
don't you?
i don't .
you changed my life and you don't remember ...
apple , please ...
i'll forgive you only cause you're handsome .
please don't keep the book for more than 2 weeks .
giovanna !
come in !
let's go to the living room ...
how did you know i was here?
i read the list of ... ... those assigned to the escorts .
you left no address .
sit down .
i didn't know you were in rome .
i'm staying at mom's for a while .
there's lots of room there ...
how's she?
have a guess?
something to drink?
do you think it's normal for you to come here and not call her?
i'll make some coffee .
i'm speaking to you .
you're speaking like an elder sister !
i already have a mother !
to you it's as if she's dead !
how do you know?
you can only judge me !
we're not in the court !
but what did we do to you?
giovanna , wait !
giovanna !
listen ...
hi .
hi .
what's your name?
matteo .
it's a beautiful name .
what's yours?
lolita .
where are you from?
venezuela .
what's wrong?
are you sad?
what are you looking at?
your necklace .
my necklace?
do you like it?
yes .
here you are .
for your girl .
i don't feel like i'm ready .
maybe i ...
my companions are stronger than me .
i'm always scared , maybe i'm not trained enough .
maybe i should ...
you don't have to be scared .
you'll make it .
hello?
hello .
francesca , listen to me .
yes .
i need to see you at once .
at the foro romano in two hours .
okay .
sara grew bigger .
i wish i could bring you a picture , but i was in a haste .
i was so nervous !
a few days ago nicola took her to watch " the party " .
suddenly she asked him what " a girl's period " is , in a loud voice .
and what did he do?
he explained it to her in front of everyone .
nicola cannot see differences .
young , old , crazy , sane are all the same to him .
listen ,
tell carlo to ask for a transfer .
he must leave italy .
now .
and go where?
wherever you want .
he's in danger .
the kids are small ... ... and there's the house , and his job ...
and i know him , he'll never leave .
i have to go now .
wait !
now you listen to me .
i'll try to speak to carlo and convince him , but he'll say no .
he is your friend before being the father of my children .
you must do something .
i can't .
tell them he's never alone .
tell them it's too risky for them to kill him .
save him !
swear it !
you trust me?
i do .
alright , i'll do my best .
is nicola coming for the holidays?
i think so .
on new year's eve .
i want to see sara .
only once .
what should i do?
take her to the coliseum .
i'll call you .
okay .
don't tell anyone .
i won't .
what's your job?
i'm an engineer .
every mother dreams of having an engineer for a son !
maybe that's why i became one .
so you make dams , bridges , buildings ...
i often work abroad .
i travel much .
do you like to travel?
no .
what would you like to do?
i don't know .
maybe stay among books like you .
then come with me !
do you like chestnuts?
yes .
chestnuts please .
how much is it?
3, 000 .
that's a theft !
you can go pick them up then !
that's rome ...
here you are .
thanks .
wanna come to a place?
where?
fingers here and thumb behind , lift up your hand ... ... swing your arm ... ... and place your left foot forwards .
it's easy .
so and so .
is it my turn?
yes .
put your fingers in the holes !
no , i'll do as i prefer .
enough said .
but it won't go straightforward .
wait and you'll see .
it's weak .
shut up .
goal !
it's called " strike " .
strike !
get on .
thanks .
you're all wet , sorry .
never mind .
i'll make a phone call .
okay .
you're all wet !
i must leave tomorrow , sorry .
there are problems at work .
how long will you stay away?
a week .
i'll be back on the 7th .
what will you do on the 7th?
i'll come and pick you .
what time?
when the library closes .
i found it under the seat .
i bought it the other day but i lost it .
who knows how it ended there .
is it for your girlfriend?
it's for you .
then help me wear it .
i'll do your shift .
afternoon and evening?
yes .
you're a good friend !
i'm not sure this car could have made it on the highway .
hey now !
when will you change it?
why should i?
it's perfect !
it's old and it sucks .
no , it's beautiful and perfect .
why don't you buy a new one?
my child's a consumerist ...
are we poor?
why?
do you miss anything?
i wish we left for christmas .
we'd have exchanged presents .
we will on new year's eve .
who's coming?
granny , aunt giovanna ...
francesca?
aunt francesca , carlo , the kids ...
they had another kid .
what's his name?
asdrubale teofrasto callimaco .
callimaco?
no , nabuccodonosor .
you're making fun of me !
his name's michele .
michele?
the journey started well .
the ship was good ... " " ... to cross the ocean .
the crew was good too ... " " ... and the captain was skilled .
everything was going well .
then , one night gino was getting to his cabin ... " " and he suddenly felt hungry .
let's not show ourselves .
look at them .
yes .
they won't sleep tonight .
who cares , they're happy .
you're right .
lucky you !
why?
you have a daughter .
and?
we're much better than you all .
stop it ...
if you had a son you'd be wilder .
really?
yes , but she tamed you .
you have white hair !
only a couple !
you're a charming 40 year old man .
i'm only 37 !
but women like mature men ...
lend me your finger ...
how can you make it with 3 kids?
one's already too much for me ...
i'm devastated but i love it .
why is carlo escorted?
these are hard times .
nicola?
yes?
nothing .
michele woke up .
can you open the door?
why are you escorted?
it was the winter of our discontent ...
" the accountant climbed up the stairs .
" i was forced to wait for him ...
there was also the crazy doctor !
how are you?
fine .
yourself?
i was thinking of places like denmark , sweden or holland .
those countries look like glass boxes .
citizens can look through them .
i dream of transparent banks , and stock exchange .
this way politics and economics would be transparent too .
cute little thing ...
did he fall asleep?
have a look?
not yet .
what's wrong tonight , honey?
he's too excited , we arrived , he saw new faces ...
give him to me .
no , he's about to fall asleep .
is he sleeping?
careful .
give him to me .
mind the duck .
francesca?
she's sleeping .
she's exhausted .
holidays are tiring for her .
as regards transparency ...
do you think it's possible?
of course , in other countries it is .
but do you think italians like transparency?
i think it's an illusion .
shall we put him into his cradle?
yes .
give him to me .
don't whisper or he won't fall asleep .
kids like noise , they're afraid of silence .
he's sleeping .
he'll wake up in half an hour .
daddy's cute baby ...
how cute you are ...
you've always been good with kids .
are you good with women too?
of course .
do you have anyone?
not a regular one .
do you have many women?
are you jealous?
i'll tell you a secret .
i married your sister to stay close to you .
indeed you look like a " queer " .
you too .
of course !
who are your girlfriends?
you have a circle of nurses and anaesthetists?
it's none of your business !
where do you see them?
outside .
what about sara?
she doesn't know .
and none of them is somehow ...
of course .
but after a while everything's over .
you didn't answer before .
why are you escorted?
did you speak with francesca?
no .
want some whisky?
so?
looks like i'm a target .
that's why i'm escorted .
but why you?
not only judges are targets , or politicians and policemen .
the other day one of my university fellow students was shot .
they say " hit one to educate 100 " they want to educate us !
they want to terrify us .
and so you're forced to live in an armour?
any suggestions?
ask for a transfer abroad .
the governor wanted to send me to new york .
and?
drink that whisky and tell me if you like it .
why didn't you accept?
if we all leave they'll win .
how did you find out you're a target?
giulia met francesca .
giulia contacted us .
she also said she wants to see the kid .
31st december 1983
there's no room here .
i'll let francesca get off then i'll follow you .
okay .
he's worked for me for a week .
six months ago another man who was carrying cocaine was arrested in your nightclub .
he was a customer .
i'm clean .
i just care for them to be wearing a jacket .
he was arrested three times before .
i don't check criminal records .
i respect my workers 'privacy .
nothing to say , azi mohamed?
no .
i'd like to go to my parents 'house .
it's new year's eve .
i don't give a damn !
what?
someone's looking for you .
who's that?
a certain mirella .
why did you say your name's nicola?
what are you doing here?
why didn't you say your name's matteo?
how did you find out?
i asked some guy at the bowling .
you go there often .
he said you're a policeman .
i should be the detective here , while everyone investigates me , instead .
you , my sister ...
everyone wants to mind my own business .
what do you want?
i wanted to see you .
i thought we were happy together .
so what?
nothing .
but ...
what?
what?
i'm busy .
why do you act like that?
i'm on duty .
i don't understand .
why did you lie to me?
you've always lied to me !
why did you say your name's nicola?
i'll tell you , but not here .
fine .
i'm leaving .
fine .
you like books cause you can close them whenever you want .
life is different , you can't decide that .
you're wrong .
i've always decided .
also not to see you anymore .
that's not a choice .
good girl , you got it !
i'm an asshole , i suck .
you better lose me .
now leave .
you aren't like that .
what the hell ... ... do you want from me?
nicola ...
my name's matteo !
go away !
let's play " merchant at the fair " !
yes !
no !
it's a good game .
you're snobbish !
we'll play it .
who plays the merchant?
you will , as you're impartial .
no .
you're a judge !
who plays the bidder?
carlo , he's into trade !
no !
come on carlo !
okay .
not because i'm a merchant , but because i'm the only good one here !
read again and sign it .
you wait here , a colleague will take you downstairs .
we're not done yet .
sit down .
sit down !
how much money will he give you if you go to prison in his place?
what?
how much?
this is a serious accusation !
shut up !
i won't !
i want to call my lawyer .
you can't treat me like that !
does he give you the drugs?
you're a penniless wretch .
where do you find the money?
does he give it to you?
does he?
what do you want?
who are you?
don't try and fool me !
that's not fair !
i want my lawyer !
you'll remember tonight forever !
lawyer my foot !
that's not fair at all .
a friend of mine is a deputy .
i'll have you transferred !
and i'll break your teeth !
calm down !
how dare you !
what the hell are you doing?
are you crazy?
i don't want to get in trouble because of you .
but remember , he's got nothing to do with it .
it's 500 lire each .
take your change .

this morning when the ambulance and the police arrived a beautiful girl came .
her hair was dark .
her eyes ...
i don't know .
it doesn't matter .
it was strange because your brother never brought any girl in .
such a good looking man with no girlfriends !
go ahead .
the girl asked me about your brother .
i told her what happened and she ran away .
maybe you know her .
no .
he was so good , so kind , a real gentleman !
thank you .
i'm sorry .
look , you'll think i'm crazy , but i think your brother was pushed .
nonsense !
sorry .
take this lady downstairs .
officer please .
doctor , is your brother identifying the body for the report?
no , i am .
are you sure?
yes .
stay with mom .
okay .
stay with mom .
i will .
it's time to go .
all these books !
get some bags , let's take the books .
we can't take all of them right now .
i'll do it tomorrow .
only a few of them , please .
okay .
mom !
mom !
please , stop !
mom !
enough !
enough !
calm down !
i was supposed to understand
but i didn't .
no , maybe i understood , but ...
it was like with giulia .
i could have stopped her .
he was in front of me as well
he turned around , looked at me and i ... closed the door and deleted everything .
there's nothing left in my mind .
the stairs of his house , the saw dust on the ground ...
nothing .
the books on the floor , the porter ...
i should have stopped them .
i loved them both , but i couldn't chain them to that love of mine .
that was my idea of freedom .
i thought that everyone should be free to live as they wished .
what freedom is in death?
but did it happen?
did it really happen?
cause i don't believe it .
i realise what happened only when i look at mom .
i'm glad you can stay with her .
i have to leave soon though .
i asked for a transfer to sicily .
sicily?
yes , they need people and no one wants to go there .
i still have a postcard you sent me from cape north in 1966 .
it was in norwegian , and it said : ... " everything is beautiful " with three exclamation marks .
do you still believe that?
not to the exclamation marks .
listen giovanna .
giulia is in rome .
i'll meet her tomorrow .
she told francesca she wants to see sara .
i will go in her place .
i don't want to listen .
giulia wants to see sara .
shut up !
this time i won't !
the date is at the coliseum , tomorrow at 10 .
and what am i supposed to do?
do you think it's easy for me to ask you to arrest her and bury her in a prison?
should i wait for her to kill someone?
should i wait for her to be killed?
now !
doctor carati , giorgia wants to speak with you .
tell her i can't .
francesca !
bring her here , please .
i'll wait .
how shall i tell her?
how can i?
cheer up !
come on !
giorgia , i must tell you something .
a bad thing happened .
i had giulia arrested .
i thought that it was the best thing to do .
she made a bad choice , so i think it's better this way .
then there's another bad thing i have to tell you .
matteo ...
matteo ...
matteo is ...
matteo !
you force my thought to wander on the paths leading to the eternal void .
and all the while these evil times fleet by , bearing away the horde of cares ... " " consuming time and me .
and as i contemplate your peace ... " " ... the soul of the warrior roaring within me sleeps . " shall i comment on it?
shall i comment on it?
the sonnet " to the evening " is one of foscolo's most inspired ones .
it includes an alliterated line ,
... the soul of the warrior roaring within me ... " . which is full of " rs " ...
... the soul of the warrior roaring within me
you can almost hear the poet roar .
back to your seat .
go .
adriana .
how are your french lessons going?
well .
thanks .
your wife was told you're here .
she isn't my wife .
but she wants to stay in her cell .
tell her the child is here too ,
and that i'm waiting for her .
alright .
where's sara?
with giovanna .
i'll call her in a minute .
but i wanted to tell you something before .
i won't leave you alone .
you're here but ...
i can't hear you .
remember when we argued before sara was born?
we said it was a mere formality , but it isn't .
giulia ... will you marry me?
did you hear?
i want to marry you .
giulia , please .
i want you to marry me .
i'm asking for your hand !
giulia , please !
look , i don't want you to come here anymore ...
... and don't bring sara here .
i'll call her now .
i can't see her .
you can .
i don't want to !
she wants to see you !
she was 4 when you left !
now you must see her !
please , giulia !
i can't make it !
you can ...
you can make it !
come on !
let's wait a minute , okay?
so she won't realize that you cried .
okay?
okay .
sara ...
sara , look at me .
you grew up .
honey , look at me .
but weren't you blonde before?
i'll be blonde again soon .
hlgh securlty prlson
monfalco , you've got mail !
sprlng of 1992
monfalco , you've got mail !
my love , here's something that only you can read .
excuse me !
excuse me !
send it back , i don't want it .

very well .

sara !

i won this medal in a swimming race in 1964 .
take it , so you'll have one too now .
are you kidding me?
i wanted my own medal .
i was supposed to win .
i always beat that girl before .
come on , eat your food .
tomorrow i'm going to milan .
will you go to sleep at alessia's?
what are you going there for?
a psychiatric examination to a prison inmate .
who's that?
the manager of a public enterprise .
the defence asked for his release for health's problems .
he said he's going crazy inside there .
first they steal then they cry .
how do you know?
i think he deserved it .
he should have thought twice before .
why are you so mad at him?
because i hate those who make others pay for their own mistakes .
why don't you ask me what i'm thinking of?
because i always know when you're thinking about your mother .
the others had no children , they were free .
she wasn't !
she knows that and she feels guilty .
that's good !
she didn't kill anyone .
only because you stopped her in time .
she doesn't want to see me , or she can't ...
that's fine , but what about you?
you write and she doesn't answer , you go there and she doesn't want to see you .
this makes me angry !
and what should i do?
find another woman !
my friends are crazy for you .
don't you like alessia , for example?
come on !
well you're quite old after all , you gained weight too ...
you should be careful .
you're still in love with her .
i'm not .
you are , i read the last letter you sent her .
you shouldn't have .
i didn't do it on purpose , it was on the table .
but you still love her , and i don't want you to .
i would like to be able to take my own decisions .
you're right , sorry .
tell me , was that a fight?
no , you and i cannot fight .
why?
because i love you too much .
you don't say it often .
i don't say many other things .
like?
i want to go to rome and become a restorer .
i'll live with francesca and carlo .
you should ask them , before .
i already have .
will you be sad if i go there?
yes .
i know , but i'll leave all the same .
idiot .
you cannot speak or you don't want to?
the court asked me to examine you and your lawyer agrees .
do you agree too?
just say " yes " or " no " .
i know you have a daughter .
i have one too .
when one is in prison they feel like their children are ashamed of them .
but our children are stronger than us .
they're too full of life and curiosity ... to get depressed because of their fathers 'misfortunes ... or their mothers '.
are you here to check if i'm crazy?
you lawyer would love that .
my wife and daughter don't know the truth .
i found out myself yesterday .
you didn't know you were doing illegal things?
you work in a hospital ... ... hospitals are paid commissions too , it's normal .
yet you never noticed anything , did you?
maybe you suspected it , but pretended not to see , as millions of italians do .
then , one day a judge arrives and says that commissions are bribes , and that political parties can't be financed secretly and that i am a thief .
wow ...
now prisons aren't only full of unlucky apple thieves .
now justice is done !
but they forget they queued to give us money ... ... in change for favours and contracts .
now they play the part of those who wanna change the world .
doctor , nothing's actually happening .
they arrested a bunch of idiots like me who were caught stealing , while all the others keep stealing undisturbed .
i didn't make italy .
well , you didn't as well , our fathers made this italy here .
my father didn't .
believe me .
i'm sure your father was an honest man , and you like to feel honest too , don't you?
excuse me , can i have your catalogue?
of course .
here you are .
thanks .
are the photos for sale?
almost all of them .
almost "?
yes , the one in the poster isn't , for example .
where was he?
what was he doing?
did you ask them?
no , those who took the picture weren't there .
here's her name .
" mirella utano " .
maybe they were for her .
what?
his eyes , maybe they were for her .
who is she?
when did she meet matteo?
what does she know about him?
i don't know .
maybe he saw him in the street and took his picture .
no .
she spoke to him .
you can keep the book .
thanks .
but i want you to go and meet her .
who?
mirella .
i want you to talk to her .
why should i?
because i'm asking you .
i just do what's right , and this isn't .
did you get offended?
maybe you do everything i ask you?
i've asked you to get out of here for a long time but you don't .
i asked you to go and live with elda and gino .
did you do it?
i'm fine here .
no , you only think you are , but you aren't .
you have to go out to understand that .
we're discharging everyone but you .
you aren't a good man .
you aren't even skilled .
you used to be , now you aren't .
you were a good man , now you aren't .
the famous european law to abolish customs wasn't understood by us italians .
" people ... " " won't be able to pay taxes .
it's not that they don't want to ...
they already paid too many !
where's the police station please?
turn right at the end of the corridor .
where did you want to go?
to the woman who took the picture .
why?
to speak with her .
i spoke to the police , everything's settled .
we can leave .
can we?
but i won't take you back to the institute .
nicola , please ...
i can't .
you can , instead .
no .
yes !
you are already out .
you took marcello's jacket .
he's still wondering where it is ...
you took a streetcar and came here all alone .
i won't take you back there .
that's the house .
are the others awake?
i think so .
a bus will take a few of them to work in a while .
do you think i can make it?
you've already made it .
thank you then .
don't thank me .
matteo made you leave the hospital .
he gave us this present .
will you come to see me often?
not too often , but i will .
smile , this is an important day .
aren't you happy?
go .
are you coming too?
no .
take your bag and buzz .
they'll open up .
come on !
i want you to have it .
but i gave it to you ...
you can find the titles at the end of the book .
matteo's picture is number 7 .
hi , giampiero .
hi , giorgia .
se ...
... ven " .
matteo , when he was nlcola .
how can i contact her?
alright .
thanks anyways .
bye .
i was told she doesn't live here in milan .
now she's in palermo for a report on the massacre .
which massacre?
judge falcone was killed .
judge carati , what happened exactly?
where are you going?
i need to speak with judge carati .
that's impossible .
i'm her brother , nicola carati .
you can't see her .
go away .
" here's rosaria , vito schifani's widow .
she wants to speak .
she gets closer to cardinal pappalardo .
silence !
you must tell them the lord will punish them ... " " ... and they'll burn in hell !
" let's hope for them to change .
you must tell them !
you said they'll change too , they'll repent ... " " ... then they'll be forgiven .
i haven't lost my hope , father .
people outside can see the coffins now .
they're all pressing to pay tribute to them ...
... to giovanni falcone , francesca morvillo ... " " ... antonio montinaro , vito schifani , and rocco di cillo .
you can wait here thanks .
hi .
i knew you were in palermo , but these are terrible days .
i saw you this morning but couldn't get close to you .
i'm tired .
we're all tired , we're all so busy ...
i'd bury my head in the sand .
you aren't like that ...
what are you doing in palermo?
i have to meet a person .
shall we have lunch together?
i can't .
i only have half an hour left .
how are mom and francesca?
i haven't been to rome lately .
what about sara?
she's really pretty .
she's always been .
what about you?
and you?
i'm the judge , i ask questions .
hello?
hi , thanks for calling me back .
yes , tomorrow is perfect .
where?
that's fine .
see you .
it's not as it seems ...
we shall teach respect to our children .
we shall do our duty !
we shall respect justice !
we shall fight against immorality !
we shall never ask kindly for our rights to be respected !
we shall fight against the mafia !
we shall remember giovanni falcone !
we shall remember all the victims of the mafia !
we shall remember them as our siblings !
we shall love them like our siblings !
we shall defend that love being a good example for others !
sorry to make you wait , but i must develop them now .
we'll speak when i'm done .
won't you get bored?
thanks .
i took that picture here .
right in this place .
it was different ...
the towels were orange .
how long had you met him?
five minutes .
he said his name was nicola .
he never told me his real name ,
i found out by myself .
i found out on the day ... ... when ...
i left the morning after , i went back home .
i needed to stay all alone for a while .
so you met him again in rome?
yes .
a few hours before he ...
sorry .
it's too hard ..
for me too .
i still can't speak about him with anyone .
i'm sorry .
i'm about to leave .
how can you live on an island and be a reporter?
i only work as much as i need .
when i'm needed , as when important things happen , like today .
are you going to turin?
yes , returning home to my daughter .
do you have a daughter?
yes , sara .
she's 18 .
she wants to be a restorer .
she's a grown up !
yes , she is !
do you have children?
yes , one .
he's about 8 and will be in the third grade this year .
his name's andrea and he's as handsome as matteo .
hello , can i help you?
thanks , sir .
don't bother ...
" sir "?
nicola !
mom , you look like a poor oldie !
because i am !
what's this darkness?
i can't stand the light .
it looks like a catacomb here .
giovanna used to draw the curtains .
i'll do it .
let the light in .
don't make such a row .
it's a beautiful day .
please don't .
look at the sun .
mom i have something beautiful to tell you .
something about matteo .
one of those unpredictable things he used to do .
when he was in palermo he met a woman , mirella , and they had an affair .
an affair?
yes , a love affair .
mirella had a baby , he was born after matteo left us .
his name's andrea .
he'd love to meet his granny .
a baby?
yes mom .
we'll catch the train to naples and then the ferryboat to sicily .
we'll be there tomorrow morning .
wait a minute .
what's wrong mom?
want some water?
i can't ...
i'm not ready .
what does that mean?
how do you know it's true?
it is .
i met the child .
why didn't she tell us before?
why didn't she write?
why do you always have problems when something good happens?
let's leave , mom .
i can't .
come on !
sara wants to move to carlo and francesca's place .
i know , we spoke about it .
everybody knew it but me !
are you disappointed?
no .
sara needs to live in a house where a mother is .
francesca is a good mother .
thanks honey .
for what?
for never being jealous of your siblings .
in fact i was jealous of someone else .
of whom?
your students .
my students?
yes .
you took them to see museums and to our house , and checked their homework ...
i thought you loved them more than us .
they lacked real families .
no one paid attention to them , their parents never spoke to them .
and so you did that ...
yes , but maybe i should have spoken with you more .
come on mom , cheer up !
don't speak milanese , you're so bad at it ...
how did you get used to rome?
it was love at first sight .
it looks so decayed and ruined ...
rotten and mephitic ...
and its inhabitants seem cynical and impolite , but they're just full of irony .
do you know where i met your dad?
no .
in campo de 'fiori , at the market .
he was a costermonger .
he bought fruit and greens in naples .
you know , one of his deals .
on his cart there was a notice saying " spanish oranges " .
so i asked him if they were really spanish .
miss , can't you hear the castanets?
and what did you do?
i bought the oranges and married him !
andrea , they're here .
hi .
" hi " and?
hi granny .
hi !
granny said " hi " .
if you cry i'll hit you !
i think they like each other .
so do i.
by the way i wanted to thank you .
for what?
for letting us come .
i did nothing special .
you could have said " no " .
come on ...
where's your school?
over there .
will you attend middle school there too?
no , in lipari .
where's lipari?
there , but there's no volcano .
are you scared of volcanoes?
no .
what scares you?
nothing .
you're lucky .
i'm afraid of many things .
for example i was afraid of coming here .
did the sea scare you?
yes .
why?
you can't swim?
no .
it's easy .
i can teach you .
he spoke about faith , which never abandoned him ... " " not even when he was on the verge of desperation .
of faith , which comes from the knowledge of men and things .
he spoke a long time , as if he were speaking to himself ... " " ... about his own courage and energy under any circumstances .
go ahead !
his thoughts were so clear that he never even changed his tone of voice .
these are pictures of matteo .
i haven't been able to look at them since ...
i tried , sometimes .
my hands started shaking .
i want you to have them .
one day andrea could be curious to know what his father looked like when he was a child .
shall we look at them together?
bye .
thanks for everything .
see you soon .
let's go mom .
okay .
i'll miss your eyes .
if you cry i'll hit you !
i'll hit you , you're annoying !
stay with us .
how?
there's a lot of room here , and i'd love it .
andrea would as well , wouldn't you?
sure , granny .
stay !
yes , stay .
i don't have suitable clothes ...
you can buy some .
and i'll have francesca send you what you need .
should i stay then?
of course .
mom , can't you hear the castanets?
granny , can't you hear the castanets?
the accelerator is on the right !
there are so many hats , what should i do with them?
alright , i'll keep them .
no , i didn't pack the flowered dress .
because ...
wait a minute .
you tell her .
thanks .
hello?
yes granny .
i'm learning the roman dialect !
how are you?
listen granny , as regards the flowered dress ...
do you really need it?
you know , it's back in fashion ...
you'll look like an oldie wearing it .
viper !
why do you want to look older?
it's perfect on me , instead .
francesca says it too .
it's true , mom .
she looks ...
remember that picture of you and dad in capri?
are you ready?
yes .
do i really look good?
you look great !
i should wear high heels too , but i can't walk in them .
come on !
the kids are coming out of school !
can i drive?
no .
please , only this time !
no .
thanks .
i like this place .
it's all ruined .
but it's beautiful .
they have to treat you well .
i'll speak with the owner .
yes , please .
when's the break finishing?
slavery's been over
since abraham lincoln's times !
" desire to work , jump up at me !
" speak less , work more !
understood?
teacher , you taught this kid well !
sprlng of 1995
let's go .
observe a minute's silence in front of this wonder .
come on , don't put on such faces !
this is a wonderful place .
the landscape is beautiful .
it is .
what's that?
that's clay .
it's a wreck !
come on guys , a little more imagination !
you don't have enough faith or imagination .
follow me .
so , i need two or three good ideas here .
which ideas?
look at those cracks !
it needs new foundations .
there are cracks in the frame !
that's why i called you , micavi enterprises !
okay , but you can't lay foundations on clay !
i want sloping red bricks here .
like in piazza del campo in siena .
of course !
you're always complaining !
why?
you're rich now !
you're the owner !
i'm rich in debts !
owners always complain .
stop it !
i'd like the windows there .
i'd use aluminium for the windows .
no way !
aluminium window frames?
here i want the kitchen .
look at this wonder !
francesca wants it big .
look at that fireplace .
simply great !
here i want a bathroom .
here will be the nursery .
every room must have a bath .
i count on that .
here i want another studio , or even ...
i don't know .
we'll think about it .
my only problem is i don't know what to do with these pools .
shall i keep them?
they aren't important .
but the floors need loose stone foundations .
i want hand made terracotta tiles for the floors .
do you know how much it'll cost you?
he wants it hand made !
understood?
micavi ...
i'm asking you officially .
micavi enterprises ...
can you make it?
look at that !
god dam it ...
if i can make it?
depends ...
if you ask me with respect ... ... maybe i can do you a favour .
hurry up !
i'm starving !
we're coming !
he already speaks like a owner .
there's a boy who likes sara ...
i know , francesca told me .
how is he?
did you see him?
he comes home every day .
every day?
yes .
he takes her to school
and brings her back at night .
at least he does !
yes .
fortunately !
is he a good boy?
trustworthy?
yes , like you and i at his age .
now i feel better !
thanks .
nicola will be a granny soon !
don't provoke me !
where shall i put granny ...
don't provoke me .
come on !
we're starving .
let's light a fire .
carlo , bring me some paper
so we can light it .
with my paper?
just take it !
hello?
giulia , where are you?
no , she's at school .
hello?
can i leave it here?
just for a minute .
okay .
thanks .
i'll be right back .
hi .
shall i call her?
no .
are you coming home?
no , i'm leaving at once .
who's that guy?
her boyfriend mimmo .
i have to go .
don't tell sara you saw me .
why?
please .
i'll give you a lift .
stay here , please .
let me give you a lift ...
stay here .
really .
you don't have to stop his gestures , or he'll think they make no sense , while they make sense to him .
i'll try , even if that seems impossible to me .
nothing is impossible .
i don't know what else i could do .
try to understand that sense .
that's all .
but it's like decrypting hieroglyphics !
in fact we did that little by little .
let's have the usual meeting .
can you call the others?
shall we wait for you inside?
no , under that tree .
okay kids .
you have to guess the animals .
my assistant giacomo will mime .
it's not easy ...
it's a particular animal .
giacomo is a great mime .
it's a lizard !
it isn't a lizard , it crawls .
it's a cobra !
no .
it's long !
so it's a cobra !
it crawls but it's not a cobra .
it's a snail !
no .
it isn't poisonous .
let's say it has rings .
a worm !
no , it has rings so it's a?
ring snake !
correct !
giacomo is very good .
after becoming popular in munich , paris and london , our giacomo will perform as a mime again now .
this is difficult .
it's a hare !
it isn't .
shall i put it in your office?
no , i'll check it here .
thanks .
i've got mail .
the electricity bill , a postcard from giorgia ...
oh , there's a letter too .
but there's a mistake , it's for doctor nicola carati .
who's that?
that's you !
me?
yes , that's you !
that's true , i always forget it .
giacomo , will you read it?
he can't read !
he can , and now he'll show you .
let me open it up .
they used some special glue .
here you are .
read it .
let everyone hear .
quiet please , it's an important letter .

you read very well .
is my father buried near the sea?
no .
you must bring him here .
there's the sea .
that's true .
i'll bring him here , i promise .
how was he?
he?
he was like achilles .
did granny tell you about achilles?
yes .
he was as brave and sad as him .
he knew the gods would take him .
you know how the gods are .
they send their favourite ones here , then take them back .
but before that , they make them leave a trace , so we can't forget them .
that trace is you .
this morning when you were checking the atlas , you looked like him when he was your age .
we checked an atlas too a long time ago .
we wanted to have a journey .
we wanted to go to a far away place where there's only the sea .
that place's name is cape north .
where is it?
over there .
did you reach it?
i tried but i couldn't .
your father wanted to , but in the end he didn't .
the gods were calling him .
yes , they were .
why don't you stay a few more days?
i can't , i have to leave tonight .
i need to check up the kids tomorrow .
but i don't want to leave .
then stay , i'll take you to france .
or greece or africa .
you can choose .
choose !
shall we meet again in three years now?
no .
it's good for me to see you and andrea .
sprlng of 2000
it's beautiful here .
beautiful?
it's sublime !
it's like heaven .
we told him to buy a house here
and he didn't want to ...
we had to insist !
look at that orchard !
is it new?
yes , there are palm trees too .
he put them in front of the house .
but they're still small .
you got rich with this project .
what?
you never get rich with your friends 'money .
i meant rich inside .
that of course !
giving without receiving ...
they're making me crazy .
your sister is worse than him .
watch out when you speak about my sister , or ... !
she wants darker tiles so they can match with ...
she's right .
very picky , though .
your car seems tired .
it's old .
like us .
carlo !
francesca?
there's no one here .
please notice ...
notice that shape .
it's an absolute wonder .
the garden is my favourite .
look at that wonder ...
sara?
so your daughter's getting married .
yes .
are you happy?
yes .
did he ask you for her hand?
of course he did , with respect too .
i said yes because he's a good guy .
good .
he should have his hair cut .
you're right .
there's so much room !
that's great !
look ... great work of a great artisan .
you remind me of brunelleschi or leon battista alberti .
look .
" one day all this will be yours .

i don't know .
ask her .
what's she like?
is she pretty?
very much .
did you tell her?
it's not easy .
i know .
you have to tell her all the same .
tell her she's pretty , and that you are as well .
what do you mean?
you are , we only have to see if a beard fits you .
is she a witty girl?
i don't think so .
let's switch to b plan then .

what happened?
sara , my love , i've worked in a record office in florence for a while now .
a few days ago i found a 1966 newspaper with a picture .
i thought you'd like to see the way your parents were .
we were two cheerful people who wanted you very much .
all the sad things came later , and it was never your fault .
i'm trying to start over .
away from everyone .
i don't want to bother anyone with my presence .
i received it two days ago .
is that you with mom?
yes .
florence , 1966 .
what should i do?
it depends on how strong you feel .
are you happy?
of course i am .
then it's time for you to be generous .
bye .
bye .
bye .
mom !
giulia?
mom ...
mom , is there a bed in your place?
there's mine , but it's small .

sure .
squeeze up .
good .
say " cheese " .
done .
thanks .
thanks .

shall we look for something nice for the new house?
we could go to ...
there are many nice things here .
this could be a container for bread , but i don't like it .
those can be nice plates .
no .
i want something special , with more colours .
what's that?
it's a hat block .
can we have a look around?
of course .
thanks .
that's the " maestro " of santo spirito .
it was painted by the sons of domenico del mazziere , agnolo and donnino .
donnino is more talented , i think he painted the baby .
see how it ...
this is wonderful , it's the " maestro della conversazione " of santo spirito .
this is one of the best works by maso di bianco .
it's my favourite work .
all those madonnas with the baby !
why do you like them so much?
are you pregnant?
i still haven't told anyone .
what can i do for you?
there is something .
what?
play for me .
where?
there's an organ here .
i haven't played for so long ...
i can't do it .
and we're in a church , you need the authorisation .
never mind then .
i only asked you for a thing and you won't do it because you need the authorisation .
you wanted to change the world and now you need a permission to play .
come on .
let's go to bed .
stirrup cup?
no .
i'm in a coma .
i do not drink .
get up .
help me .
slowly .

slowly .
watch out !
this way?
no , that way .
by the way you ... ... should understand something .
can i say it?
yes .
then i'll say it .
stop thinking of matteo as of an obstacle .
otherwise you'll end up hating him .
what does that mean?
are you drunk?
yes .
goodnight .
however ...
however .
it's too dark !
don't worry .
there was a door here?
you built this house .

maybe it's just my imagination .
it's good to do something with the people you love , even if sometimes i have to do what ermione wants .

everything's really beautiful !
