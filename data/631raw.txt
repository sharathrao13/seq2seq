i heard you speaking parseltongue .
snake language .
i spoke a different language?
but i didn't realize
how can i speak a language without knowing i can?
i don't know , but it sounded like you were egging the snake on or something .
harry , listen to me .
there's a reason the symbol of slytherin house is a serpent .
salazar slytherin was a parselmouth .
he could talk to snakes too .
exactly .
now the whole school's gonna think you're his great great great grandson .
but i m not .
i can't be .
he lived a thousand years ago .
for all we know , you could be .
i il see you back in the common room .
i want blood .
they all must die .
kill .
kill .
kill .
time to kill .
caught in the act .
i il have you out this time , potter .
mark my words .
no .
mr. filch !
you don't understand
professor ... ... i swear i didn't .
this is out of my hands , potter .
professor dumbledore will be waiting for you .
sherbet lemon .
professor dumbledore?
bee in your bonnet , potter?
i was just wondering if you put me in the right house .
yes .
you were particularly difficult to place .
but i stand by what i said last year .
you would have done well in slytherin .
you're wrong .
harry?
professor .
your bird ....
there was nothing i could do .
he just caught fire .
and about time too .
he's been looking dreadful for days .
pity you had to see him on a burning day .
fawkes is a phoenix , harry .
they burst into flame when it is time for them to die ... ... and then they are ... ... reborn from the ashes .
fascinating creatures , phoenixes .
they can carry immensely heavy loads .
their tears have healing powers .
professor dumbledore , sir !
wait !
listen !
professor dumbledore , sir , it wasn't harry .
i d be prepared to swear it in front of the ministry of magic .
relax .
i do not believe ...
... that harry attacked anyone .
of course you don't .
right .
well , i il ....
i il just wait outside , then .
yes .
you don't think it was me , professor?
no , harry .
i do not think it was you .
but i must ask you ... ... is there something you wish to tell me?
no , sir .
nothing .
very well , then .
off you go .
everything's set .
we just need a bit of who you're changing into .
crabbe and goyle .
we also need to make sure that the real crabbe and goyle ... ... can't burst in on us while we're interrogating malfoy .
how?
i ve got it all worked out .
i filled these with a simple sleeping draught .
simple , but powerful .
now , once they're asleep ... ... hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs ... ... and put on their uniforms .
whose hair are you ripping out , then?
i ve already got mine .
millicent bulstrode .
slytherin .
i got this off her robes .
i m going to go check on the polyjuice potion .
make sure that crabbe and goyle find these .
ron , maybe i should do it .
yeah .
right .
wingardium leviosa .
cool .
how thick could you get?
come on , let's get them .
we'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves .
add the hairs .
essence of crabbe .
cheers .
i think i m gonna be sick .
me too .
harry?
ron .
bloody hell !
we still sound like ourselves .
you need to sound more like crabbe .
bloody hell .
excellent .
but where's hermione?
i ....
i don't think i m going .
you go on without me .
hermione , are you okay?
just go .
you're wasting time .
come on .
i think the slytherin common room's this way .
excuse me .
what are you doing d?
i mean , what are you doing down here?
i happen to be a school prefect .
you , on the other hand , have no business wandering the corridors at night .
what are your names again?
i m ....
crabbe , goyle , where have you two been?
pigging out in the great hall all this time?
why are you wearing glasses?
reading .
reading?
i didn't know you could read .
and what are you doing down here , weasley?
mind your attitude , malfoy .
well , sit down .
you'd never know the weasleys were pure bloods , the way they behave .
they're an embarrassment to the wizarding world .
all of them .
what's wrong with you , crabbe?
stomachache .
you know , i m surprised the daily prophet hasn't done a report on all these attacks .
i suppose dumbledore is trying to hush it all up .
father always said dumbledore was the worst thing ...
... that ever happened to this place .
you're wrong !
what?
you think there's someone here who's worse than dumbledore?
well?
do you?
harry potter?
good one , goyle .
you're absolutely right .
saint potter .
and people actually think that he's the heir of slytherin?
but then you must have some idea who's behind it all .
you know i don't , goyle .
i told you yesterday .
how many times do i have to tell you?
is this yours?
it s been 50 years since the chamber was opened .
he wouldn't tell me who opened it .
only that they were expelled .
the last time the chamber of secrets was opened , a mudblood died .
so it's only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time .
as for me ... ... i hope it's granger .
what's the matter with you two?
you're acting very odd .
it s his stomachache .
calm down .
scar .
hair .
hey !
where are you going?
that was close .
hermione , come out .
we've got loads to tell you .
go away .
wait till you see .
it s awful .
hermione?
are you okay?
do you remember me telling you ... ... that the polyjuice potion was only for human transformations?
it was cat hair i plucked off millicent bulstrode's robes .
look at my face .
look at your tail .
have you spoken to hermione?
she should be out of hospital in a few days ... ... when she stops coughing up fur balls .
what's this?
yuck !
looks like moaning myrtle's flooded the bathroom .
come to throw something else at me?
why would i throw something at you?
don't ask me .
here i am , minding my own business ... ... and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me .
but it can't hurt if someone throws something at you .
i mean , it'll just go right through you .
sure !
let's all throw books at myrtle because she can't feel it .
ten points if you get it through her stomach !
fifty points if it goes through her head !
but who threw it at you , anyway?
i don't know .
i didn't see them .
i was just sitting in the u bend , thinking about death ... ... and it fell through the top of my head .
tom marvolo riddle .
my name ... ... is harry ... ... potter .
do you know anything ... ... about the chamber of secrets?
can you ... ... tell me?
excuse me .
could you tell me what's going on here?
are you tom riddle?
hello , can you hear me?
riddle !
come .
professor dumbledore .
dumbledore?
it is not wise to be wandering around this late hour , tom .
yes , professor .
i suppose i ....
i had to see for myself if the rumors were true .
i m afraid they are , tom .
they are true .
about the school as well?
i don't have a home to go to .
they wouldn't really close hogwarts , would they , professor?
i understand , tom , but i m afraid ... ... headmaster dippet may have no choice .
sir , if it all stopped , if the person responsible was caught ....
is there something ... ... you wish to tell me?
no , sir .
nothing .
very well , then .
off you go .
good night , sir .
let's get you out of there .
evening , hagrid .
i m going to have to turn you in , hagrid .
i don't think you meant it to kill anyone ....
you can't .
you don't understand .
the dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow .
the least hogwarts can do ... ... is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered .
it wasn't him .
aragog never killed no one .
never .
monsters don't make good pets , hagrid .
now , stand aside .
no !
stand aside , hagrid .
no !
cistem aperio !
arania exumai !
aragog !
aragog !
i can't let you go .
they'll have your wand for this , hagrid .
you'll be expelled .
hagrid !
it was hagrid .
hagrid opened the chamber of secrets 50 years ago .
it can't be hagrid .
it just can't be .
we don't even know this tom riddle .
he sounds like a dirty , rotten snitch to me .
the monster had killed somebody , ron .
what would any of us have done?
look , hagrid's our friend .
why don't we just go and ask him about it?
that would be a cheerful visit .
hello , hagrid .
tell us , have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?
mad and hairy?
you wouldn't be talking about me , now , would you?
no .
what's that you've got , hagrid?
it s flesh eating slug repellent .
for the mandrakes , you know .
now , according to professor sprout , they've still got a bit of growing up to do .
but once their acne's cleared up , we'll be able to chop them up and stew them ... ... and then we'll get those people down at the hospital un petrified .
in the meantime , though , you three ... ... had best be looking after yourselves .
all right?
hello , neville .
harry , i don't know who did it , but you'd better come .
come on !
it had to be a gryffindor .
nobody else knows our password .
unless it wasn't a student .
whoever it was , they must have been looking for something .
and they found it .
tom riddle's diary is gone .
all right , listen up .
we play our game , hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance .
we're stronger , quicker and smarter .
not to mention they're dead scared that harry will petrify them ...
... if they fly anywhere near him .
well , that too .
professor mcgonagall .
this match has been canceled .
we can't cancel quidditch .
silence , wood .
you and your teammates will go to gryffindor tower .
now .
potter , you and i will find mr. weasley .
there's something the both of you have to see .
i warn you .
this could be a wee bit of a shock .
hermione !
she was found near the library ... ... along with this .
does it mean anything to either of you?
no .
could i have your attention , please?
all students will return to their house common rooms by 6 : 00 every evening .
all students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher .
no exceptions .
unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught ... ... it is likely the school will be closed .
we've got to talk to hagrid , ron .
i can't believe it's him ... ... but if he did set the monster loose last time ... ... he'll know how to get inside the chamber of secrets .
that's a start .
but you heard mcgonagall .
we're not allowed to leave the tower except for class .
i think it's time to get my dad's old cloak out again .
who's there?
hello?
hello?
what's that for?
nothing .
i was expecting ....
it doesn't matter .
come on in .
i just made a pot of tea .
hagrid , are you okay?
i m fine .
i m all right .
did you hear about hermione?
yeah .
i heard about that , all right .
look , we have to ask you something .
do you know who's opened the chamber of secrets?
what you had to understand about that is
quick , under the cloak .
don't say a word .
be quiet , both of you .
professor dumbledore , sir .
good evening , hagrid .
i wonder , could we ...?
of course .
come in .
come in .
that's dad's boss .
cornelius fudge , minister of magic .
bad business , hagrid , very bad business .
had to come .
three attacks on muggle borns .
things have gone far enough .
the ministry's got to act .
but i never
you know i never , professor .
i want it understood , cornelius ... ... that hagrid ... ... has my full confidence .
albus , look , hagrid's record is against him .
i ve got to take him .
take me?
take me where?
not azkaban prison .
i m afraid we have no choice , hagrid .
already here , fudge?
good .
what are you doing here?
get out of my house !
believe me ... ... i take absolutely no pleasure being inside your ....
you call this a house?
no .
i simply called up the school and was told the headmaster was here .
well , what exactly is it that you want with me?
the other governors and i have decided it's time for you to step aside .
this is an order of suspension .
you'll find all 1 2 signatures on it .
i m afraid we feel you've rather lost your touch .
well , what , with all these attacks ... ... there'll be no muggle borns left at hogwarts .
i can only imagine what an awful loss that would be to the school .
you can't take professor dumbledore away .
take him away and the muggle borns won't stand a chance .
you mark my words , there'll be killings next !
you think so?
calm yourself , hagrid .
lf the governors desire my removal ... ... i will , of course , step aside .
however ... ... you will find that help will always be given at hogwarts ... ... to those who ... ... ask for it .
admirable sentiments .
shall we?
fudge .
come , hagrid .
well?
lf ....
lf anybody was looking for some stuff ... ... then all they'd have to do would be to follow the spiders .
yep .
that would lead them right .
that's all i have to say .
and someone will need to feed fang while i m away .
good boy .
hagrid's right .
with dumbledore gone , there'll be an attack a day .
look .
come on .
come on , fang .
come on .
what?
you heard what hagrid said .
follow the spiders .
they're heading to the dark forest .
why spiders?
why couldn't it be " follow the butterflies "?
harry , i don't like this .
harry , i don't like this at all .
shush !
can we go back now?
come on .
who is it?
don't panic .
hagrid?
is that you?
we're friends of hagrid's .
and you?
you're aragog , aren't you?
yes .
hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before .
he's in trouble .
up at the school , there have been attacks .
they think it's hagrid .
they think he opened the chamber of secrets .
like before .
that's a lie .
hagrid never opened the chamber of secrets .
then you're not the monster?
no .
the monster was born in the castle .
i came to hagrid from a distant land in the pocket of a traveler .
harry .
but if you're not the monster , then what did kill that girl 50 years ago?
we do not speak of it .
it is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others .
but have you seen it?
i never saw any part of the castle but the box in which hagrid kept me .
the girl was discovered in a bathroom .
when i was accused , hagrid brought me here .
harry !
what?
well , thank you .
we'll just go .
go?
i think not .
my sons and daughters do not harm hagrid on my command .
but i cannot deny them fresh meat ... ... when it wanders so willingly into our midst .
goodbye , friend of hagrid .
can we panic now?
know any spells?
one , but it's not powerful enough for all of them .
where's hermione when you need her?
let's go !
arania exumai !
go !
glad we're out of there .
arania exumai !
thanks for that .
don't mention it .
get us out of here .
now !
come on !
come on , move faster !
come on !
go !
get us in the air .
the flying gear's jammed !
come on !
pull !
i m trying !
follow the spiders .
follow the spiders .
lf hagrid ever gets out of azkaban , i il kill him .
i mean , what was the point of sending us in there?
what have we found out?
we know one thing .
hagrid never opened the chamber of secrets .
he was innocent .
wish you were here , hermione .
we need you .
now more than ever .
what's that?
ron ....
this is why hermione was in the library the day she was attacked .
come on .
of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land ... ... none is more deadly than the basilisk .
capable of living for hundreds of years ... ... instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye .
spiders flee before it .
ron , this is it .
the monster in the chamber of secrets is a basilisk .
that's why i can hear it speak .
it s a snake .
but if it kills by looking people in the eye , why is it no one's dead?
because no one did look it in the eye .
not directly , at least .
colin saw it through his camera .
justin justin must have seen the basilisk through nearly headless nick .
nick got the full blast of it .
but he's a ghost , he couldn't die again .
and hermione had the mirror .
i bet you she was using it to look around corners in case it came along .
and mrs. norris?
i m pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror , harry .
the water .
there was water on the floor that night .
she only saw the basilisk's reflection .
spiders flee before it .
it all fits .
but how's a basilisk been getting around?
a dirty , great snake .
someone would have seen it .
hermione's answered that too .
pipes?
it s using the plumbing .
remember what aragog said about that girl 50 years ago?
she died in a bathroom?
what if she never left?
moaning myrtle .
all students are to return to their house dormitories at once .
all teachers to the second floor corridor immediately .
as you can see , the heir of slytherin has left another message .
our worst fear has been realized .
a student has been taken by the monster into the chamber itself .
the students must be sent home .
i m afraid this is the end of hogwarts .
so sorry .
dozed off .
what have i missed?
a girl has been snatched by the monster , lockhart .
your moment has come at last .
my moment?
weren't you saying just last night ... ... that you've known all along where the entrance to the chamber of secrets is?
that's settled .
we'll leave you to deal with the monster , gilderoy .
your skills , after all , are legend .
very well .
i il just be in my office getting ....
getting ready .
who is it that the monster's taken , minerva?
ginny weasley .
her skeleton will lie in the chamber forever .
ginny .
lockhart may be useless , but he's going to try and get into the chamber .
at least we can tell him what we know .
professor , we have some information for you .
are you going somewhere?
well , yes .
urgent call .
unavoidable .
got to go .
what about my sister?
well ....
as to that , most unfortunate .
no one regrets more than l .
you're the defense against the dark arts teacher .
you can't go now .
i must say , when i took the job , there was nothing in the description
you're running away?
after all you did in your books?
books can be misleading .
you wrote them .
my dear boy , do use your common sense .
my books wouldn't have sold half as well if people didn't think i d done those things .
you're a fraud .
you've been taking credit for what other wizards have done .
is there anything you can do?
yes , now you mention it .
i m rather gifted with memory charms .
otherwise , all those wizards would have gone blabbing .
i d never have sold another book .
in fact , i m going to have to do the same to you .
don't even think about it .
who's there?
hello , harry .
what do you want?
to ask you how you died .
it was dreadful .
it happened right here in this very cubicle .
i d hidden because olive hornby was teasing me about my glasses .
i was crying , and then i heard somebody come in .
who was it , myrtle?
i don't know .
i was distraught !
but they said something funny , a kind of made up language .
and i realized it was a boy , so i unlocked the door to tell him to go away and ... ... i died .
just like that?
how?
i just remember seeing a pair of great , big , yellow eyes ... ... over there by that sink .
this is it .
this is it , ron .
i think this is the entrance to the chamber of secrets .
say something .
harry , say something in parseltongue .
excellent , harry .
good work .
well , then , i il just be ....
there's no need for me to stay .
yes , there is .
you first .
now , boys , what good will it do?
better you than us .
but obviously , yes .
sure you don't want to test it first?
it s really quite filthy down here .
all right .
let's go .
oh , harry?
lf you die down there , you're welcome to share my toilet .
thanks , myrtle .
any sign of movement , close your eyes straightaway .
go on .
this way .
what's this?
it looks like a snake .
it s a snakeskin .
bloody hell .
whatever shed this must be 60 feet long .
or more .
heart of a lion , this one .
the adventure ends here , boys .
but don't fret .
the world will know our story .
how i was too late to save the girl .
how you two tragically lost your minds ... ... at the sight of her mangled body .
so ....
you first , mr. potter .
say goodbye to your memories .
obliviate !
ron !
ron , are you okay?
i m fine .
hello .
who are you?
ron weasley .
really?
and who am l?
lockhart's memory charm backfired .
he hasn't got a clue who he is .
it s an odd sort of place , isn't it?
do you live here?
no .
really?
what do i do now?
you wait here ... ... and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through .
i il go on and find ginny .
okay .
ginny !
ginny , please don't be dead .
wake up , wake up .
please wake up .
she won't wake .
tom .
tom riddle .
what do you mean , she won't wake?
she's not ...?
she's still alive , but only just .
are you a ghost?
a memory ... ... preserved in a diary for 50 years .
she's cold as ice .
ginny , please don't be dead .
wake up .
you've got to help me , tom .
there's a basilisk .
it won't come until it's called .
give me my wand , tom .
you won't be needing it .
we've got to go .
we've got to save her .
i m afraid i can't do that .
you see , as poor ginny grows weaker , i grow stronger .
yes , harry , it was ginny weasley who opened the chamber of secrets .
no .
she couldn't .
she wouldn't .
it was ginny who set the basilisk on the mudbloods and filch's cat ... ... ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls .
but why?
because i told her to .
you'll find i can be very persuasive .
not that she knew what she was doing .
she was , shall we say , in a kind of trance .
still , the power of the diary began to scare her .
she tried to dispose of it in the girls 'bathroom .
and then who should find it but you?
the very person i was most anxious to meet .
and why did you want to meet me?
i knew i had to talk to you , meet you if i could .
so i decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf hagrid ...
... to gain your trust .
hagrid's my friend .
and you framed him , didn't you?
it was my word against hagrid's .
only dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent .
i il bet dumbledore saw right through you .
he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that .
i knew it wouldn't be safe to open the chamber again while i was still at school ... ... so i decided to leave behind a diary ... ... preserving my 1 6 year old self in its pages ... ... so that one day i would be able to lead another ... ... to finish salazar slytherin's noble work .
well , you haven't finished it this time .
in a few hours , the mandrake draught will be ready .
and everyone who was petrified will be all right again .
haven't i told you?
killing mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore .
for many months now , my new target has been you .
how is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent ... ... was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time?
how did you escape with nothing but a scar ... ... while lord voldemort's powers were destroyed?
why do you care how i escaped?
voldemort was after your time .
voldemort is my past , present and future .
you .
you're the heir of slytherin .
you're voldemort .
surely you didn't think ... ... i was going to keep my filthy muggle father's name?
no .
i fashioned myself a new name , a name i knew wizards everywhere ... ... would one day fear to speak when i became the greatest sorcerer in the world .
albus dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world .
dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me .
he'll never be gone .
not as long as those who remain are loyal to him .
fawkes?
so this is what dumbledore sends his great defender .
a songbird and an old hat .
let's match the power of lord voldemort , heir of salazar slytherin ... ... against the famous harry potter .
parseltongue won't save you now , potter .
it only obeys me .
no !
your bird may have blinded the basilisk , but it can still hear you .
yes , potter .
the process is nearly complete .
in a few minutes , ginny weasley will be dead , and i will cease to be a memory .
lord voldemort will return ... ... very much alive .
ginny?
remarkable , isn't it ... ... how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body?
i d guess you have little more than a minute to live .
you'll be with your dear mudblood mother soon , harry .
funny , the damage a silly little book can do ... ... especially in the hands of a silly little girl .
what are you doing?
stop .
no !
it was me .
but i swear , i didn't mean to .
riddle made me , and ....
harry , you're hurt .
don't worry .
ginny , you need to get yourself out .
follow the chamber and you'll find ron .
you were brilliant , fawkes .
i just wasn't quick enough .
of course .
phoenix tears have healing powers .
thanks .
it s all right , ginny .
it s over .
it s just a memory .
amazing !
this is just like magic !
you both realize , of course ... ... that in the past few hours , you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules .
yes , sir .
there is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled .
yes , sir .
therefore , it is only fitting ... ... that you both receive ... ... special awards for services to the school .
thanks , sir .
now , mr. weasley , if you would ... ... have an owl deliver these release papers to azkaban .
i believe we want our gamekeeper back .
first , i want to thank you , harry .
you must have shown me real loyalty down in the chamber .
nothing but that could have called fawkes to you .
and ... ... second ... ... i sense that something is troubling you .
am i right , harry?
it s just ....
you see , sir , i couldn't help but notice certain things , certain ....
certain similarities between tom riddle and me .
i see .
well , you can speak parseltongue , harry .
why?
because lord voldemort can speak parseltongue .
lf i m not mistaken , harry ... ... he transferred some of his powers to you ... ... the night he gave you that scar .
voldemort transferred some of his powers to me?
not intentionally ... ... but yes .
so the sorting hat was right .
i should be in slytherin .
it s true .
you possess many of the qualities that voldemort himself prizes .
determination , resourcefulness ... ... and if i may say so , a certain disregard for the rules .
why , then , did the sorting hat place you in gryffindor?
because i asked it to .
exactly , harry .
exactly .
which makes you different from voldemort .
it is not our abilities that show what we truly are .
it is our choices .
lf you want proof why you belong in gryffindor ... ... then i suggest you look more closely at this .
be careful .
godric gryffindor .
it would take a true gryffindor to pull that out of the hat .
dobby .
so this is your master .
the family you serve is the malfoys .
i il deal with you later .
out of my way , potter .
so it's true .
you have returned .
when the governors learned that arthur weasley's daughter ... ... was taken into the chamber , they saw fit to summon me back .
ridiculous .
curiously , lucius , several of them ... ... were under the impression that you would curse their family ... ... if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place .
how dare you !
beg your pardon?
my sole concern has always been and will always be ... ... the welfare of this school ... ... and , of course , its students .
the culprit has been identified , i presume?
yes .
and?
who was it?
voldemort .
only this time he chose to act through somebody else ... ... by means of this .
i see .
fortunately , our young mr. potter discovered it .
one hopes that no more of lord voldemort's old school things ... ... should find their way into innocent hands .
the consequences for the one responsible would be ... ... severe .
well , let us hope ... ... that mr. potter will always be around to save the day .
don't worry .
i will be .
dumbledore .
come , dobby .
we're leaving .
sir?
i wonder if i could have that?
mr. malfoy .
mr. malfoy !
i have something of yours .
mine?
i don't know what you're talking about .
i think you do , sir .
i think you slipped the diary into ginny weasley's cauldron ... ... that day at diagon alley .
you do , do you?
why don't you prove it?
come , dobby .
open it .
dobby .
master has given dobby a sock .
what?
i didn't give
master has presented dobby with clothes .
dobby is free .
you lost me my servant !
you shall not harm harry potter .
your parents were meddlesome fools too .
mark my words , potter .
one day soon ... ... you are going to meet the same sticky end .
harry potter freed dobby .
how can dobby ever repay him?
just promise me something .
anything , sir .
never try to save my life again .
welcome back , sir nicholas .
thank you .
good evening , sir nicholas .
good evening .
good to see you , sir nicholas .
thank you .
hello .
hermione !
welcome back .
thanks , sir nicholas .
harry .
it s hermione .
welcome back , hermione .
it s good to be back .
congratulations .
i can't believe you solved it .
we had loads of help from you .
we couldn't have done it without you .
thanks .
could i have your attention , please?
before we begin the feast ... ... let us have a round of applause for professor sprout , madam pomfrey ... ... whose mandrake juice has been so successfully administered ... ... to all who had been petrified .
also , in light of the recent events ... ... as a school treat ... ... all exams have been canceled .
oh , no .
sorry i m late .
the owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused .
some ruddy bird called errol .
and i d just like to say that if it hadn't been for you , harry and ron ... ... and hermione , of course ... ... i would still be you know where ... ... so i d just like to say thanks .
there's no hogwarts without you , hagrid .
