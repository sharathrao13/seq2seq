you're a lucky man .
hey , i know that .

that's what i'm talkin 'about . what are you doing , willie? .
hey , i slipped .
i still got my flag .
i'm good .
i'm good .
oh , my peewee .
always moving so fast .
you move in together after a month ...
iive together for nine months , and nowyou're engaged .
oh , i knowyou love him , butyou know ... sometimes it takes more than love ... to sustain a marriage .
you need to be old enough to know whoyou are ... and whatyou want and who he is .
oh , mom , mom , he's wild and spontaneous ... and hysterical and offbeat ... and on top of all that ... he's centered , and he's down to earth .
he's everything i want ... and we have this passion for each other ... that's just ... oh !
i'm jealous .
ha ha ha !
all right . first thing tomorrow ... we're gonna plan this wedding !
hey , you .
so i guess everyone thinks that we're crazy ... for doing this .
now , when did we start caring about what other people think? .
well , areyou sure that ... you don't want to marry a guy like peter? .
ifl wanted to know exactlywhat my life would be ... from here on out ...
i would marry a guy like peter .
but i love not knowing .
i love our messy loft .
your beater car .
ha ha .
i want to start a life with you .
sarah?
go .
hi , daddy .
peewee ... marriage is like a business investment .
its its long term viability ... is best established unemotionally .
bottom line , daddy? . we love each other .
that is all that matters , tsk .
leezak .
good night , sir .
congratulations , mr. leezak .
big daddy leezak's in the house !
oh , i hope she doesn't spook on you , man . what do you mean? .
i love sarah .
don't get me wrong , but ... rich chicks spook .
a powerful daddy plus family money ... equals expectations .
expectations are like a fungal rot on a marriage .
my marriage is not gonna have a fungal rot . we're gonna be happily married every day ... for the rest of our lives .
unless she finds out that you slaughtered her dog .
oh , don't worry .
i'll take that to my grave .
okay .
ifyou changeyour mind at the altar ... just pass out .
i'm not going to change my mind .
okay .
i'm just saying ifyou do ... just hit the floor .
thankyou , but it's not gonna happen .
so , you're sure you're ready ... to give up your grazing rights? .
i'm not a grazer , kyle . well , what ifyou became one later in life? .
i mean , over the next 1 0 years ... you're giving up five hayrides peryear .
so i can either be happily married to sarah ... or have 50 one night stands .
minimum .
that's not even a choice .
okay , okay .
let's move on .
are there any chicks you didn't have ... thatyou wish you had? .
you are , like , the worst best man ever .
hey , peter !
overhere , prentiss .
i can't believe she invited prentiss .
glad you made it , buddy .
hey , man . what's going on? .
did she ever hook up with that yahoo? .
theywent backpacking in europe once .
it was after high school .
i don't think anything happened .
whoa .
you're getting married ... and she didn't share the roster? .
she shared the roster .
merrick and bruce .
what about prentiss? .
and you never asked again? .
i won .
it's irrelevant .
oh .
okay .
as long as you're okay with a bogus roster .
it's not a bogus roster .
is he on , or is he off? .
he's
shut up .
huh? .
huh? .
and you could've had peter .
i did have peter .
it wasn't that hot , okay? .
excuse me? .
i was in seattle ... helping on an appraisal ... ran into peter we went out .
i drank way too much ... andbefore i knewit we ... tussled .
you bad girl .
i wanted to tell tom so many times ... but he gets so jealous , you know? .
listen , it doesn't matter that he doesn't know .
it's not like you guys were married ... and even ifyou were
no , no , no .
it matters to me .
it's like living a lie .
i cannot live a lie .
there will always be this big , fat elephant ... in the room with us .

no reason .
does kyle know something that i should know? .
no .
you covered your nose .
i had an itch .
you were hiding flared nostrils . what doyou have to tell? .
okay .
it's just ... when bags died ... he didn't exactly die ... the way that i described it .
him chasing those squawking pigeons offthe balcony? .

well
okay .
i'm reading my magazine ... and i'm really i'm focusing ... and i'm really into it ... and along comes bags , you know? .

no , it was more like a lie ! where areyou going? .
i have to figure out what to dowith this . what does that mean? .
i can deal with you being cheap ... and i can deal with you being a shitty driver .
i cannot not deal with you being a liar ! whoa . wait a second .
