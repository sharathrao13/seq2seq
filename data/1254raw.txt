## [ girl vocalizing ]
once upon a time , there was a little girl
just like any other little girl .
and like most little girls  [ girl ]
i gotcha ! she loved collecting beautiful things .
look it what i have .
always sharing them with her friends .
hel lo .
come on over and meet my friends , hoppers .
she would throw the most amazing tea parties for her very closest companions .
mr. elephant , have you met my daddy?
he's the governor , you know .
and then it happened .
you know that awkward but typical time oflife ...
when you feel like every eye is on you  [ man ]
mackenzie !
iike you're the main attraction in a three ring circus .
that's right .
she became a teenager .
but eventually , she made it through .
and as she blossomed , she became more comfortable with herself .
there she is .
hey , sam .
how you doi ng?
h i , dad .
h i , sweetie .
i 'd like you to meet
and like most teenagers , she enjoyedparties ...
andpizza .
enjoy .
thanks .
and like herpeers ... she often felt as ifher every move was scrutinized .
hold it right there .
big smile , sam .
mom , prom ise me you would never let me leave the house looking like that .
never !
it looks like she found chelsea clinton's old crimping iron ... and amy carter's sassoons .
it's like a terrorist got a hold ofher .
i don't know what's going on .
but what doyou think?
what is the worst outfit thatyou have everseen samantha wear?
i'll bet it's gonna be close .
i bet it is too .
there have been a lot of lousy outfits .
ifmac is back , get in there and clean outyourkid's closet .
but with maturity ...
thank you .
she was able to look outside herself ... and appreciate the wisdom ofher elders .
and i 'll tell you something .
decades in politics give you ... special life skills , sam .
like an excellent poker face .
not bad , senator downer .
thankyou for the tip .
in short ...
she grew up ... happily ...
good night . with the love ofa father ...
good night , sam . and a mother ...
seeyou in the morning , sweetheart . who she thought were the center ofthe world ... in an old white house ... they called home .

somethi ng wrong with sam .
are you sure?
it's an election year , remember?
she could use a little down time .

mr. and mrs. latifmoratee , president mackenzie , first lady ...
samantha .
hello .
good to meet you .
nice to meet you , samantha .

this way .
we have press conference at 9 : 00 .
to marine one , 9 : 1 5 .
to airforce one at 1 0 : 00 .
travel time , four hours , 59 minutes .
twenty five minutes to destination redmond univ
hold that thought , liz .
let's pretend that tomorrow i'm heading offto college .
mm hmm .
i grab my bags , which i packed myself .
i throw them into my adorable collegiate car ... next to my cooler that has a beer hiding underneath the bologna sandwiches .
my parents cry .
their only child is growing up and so forth .
and then i do it .
i drive offlike the normal , run of the mill kid that i am .
you'restillaprincess .
youshouldat least weara ball gown .
ignorance is bliss .
what can i say?
i say , good night , normal , boring girl .
and you better hide that beer , because under the sandwiches that's the first place they'll look .
duly noted .
goodnight .
did you take the southern route through the stairwell ... or the northern route through the access hall?
eastern route .
oh !
two elevators , one moving walkway , turn left at the lincoln arches .
it's lesser known , but very effective .
mm hmm .
eastern route's one of my favorites , actually .
and that lincoln arches thing is a very nice touch .
you know , ifyou're gonna eat this cake ... you have to pay the toll .
inflation .
mm hmm .
you know , you should really do something about that , dad .
mm hmm .
mm , mm , mm , mm .
not the dancing .
dancing .
## [ humming ]
ready?
ready .
good .
i need to say something .
okay .
about tomorrow .
i was thinking  mm hmm . and maybe i should go alone .
really?
yeah .
i mean ... it's hard enough to blend in , having a team of secret service men carrying my books , then
uh huh .
all i'm saying
i just wanna be like everybody else .
sam , you're not like everybody else .
ready?
it's the big finish .
here it comes .
yes !
yes .
theywon't askyou about policy .
they'll probably askyou about ... your expectations , your hopes , your major , and you'll say
don't worry , liz .
i'm set .
does anyone have my
got it .
thankyou .
so , you're just like any other american family .
whose daughter is heading offto college .
remember , todayyou're not just the first lady , butyou're also a mom .
i'd like to think i'm both women every day .
in short , you're just a proud dad .
like every other dad ... watching his little girl head offto california for college .
you can segue intoyour education reform initiative from there .
and time permitting , mr. president , the california youth literacy program .
it's not a stump speech .
it's about my daughter .
right .
mr. president , how doyou feel aboutyour only child ... going to school so far away?
well , uh , i could suggest moving the nation's capitol to california .
samantha , will you miss d. c.?
andbetteryet , what willyou miss least?
wow .
that's a tough one .
well , i can't tell you what i will miss the least ... but i can tell you what i will miss the most .
that is my friends and my family .
but i am very excited to experience life as a normal kid ... having a normal college experience .
thankyou .

how do they live?
roommate's caught in traffic .
e. t. a. is 1 0 minutes .
she should at least get the good bed ifshe has to live with me .

all i want is normal , mia .
right .
i'm going to the housing office .
they said you were the kind of girl who was up for anything .
i'm disappointed .
you're manipulating me .
yes .
it's kinda working .
please , mia .
just give it a shot .
that's all i'm asking .
well , the situation could have its advantages .
absolutely .
like , in case ofa national emergency ... guess who gets a free seat on the chopper?
i was kind ofthinking your secret service could get us beer .
you can forget about that .
we'll work on it .
mia thompson , arkansas royalty .
i didn't know they had royalty in arkansas .
course we do .
my dad's a king .
i mean , he's had a few queens since my mom , but
you know , tire king best seller ofthe south?
cool .
this is bock .
dylan's outside .
they're protecting us .
could that involve tackling me?
'cause the bald one's a little sexy .
and you can forget about that too .
yeah .
look , bonus points for giving me the good bed .
i likeyou already .
but just to letyou know , don't kiss my ass .
'cause i certainly won't be kissing yours .
mia , i likeyou already .
it's our first day .
i'm trying to have fun .
why don'tyou change clothes?
we can go hang out .
go to some parties .
meet some guys .

miss mackenzie , ispeak forthe entire faculty ... when i say , " welcome to redmond .
and i assure you that you'll be treated just like any student ... just the minute we conclude this elaborate party in your honor .
in the sense theywould support preferredpolicy .
ofcourse , the fundamental importance ofagenda control ... was established by mckelvey ... i rrespective of i m pl ications for the fi nal outcome .
in fact , one ofhis most notable papers showed ... that the one person , one vote ... system ofvoting ... did not always lead to a middle ground in decision making .
the manipulation ofagenda could have a great impact on policy making .
you m issed a great party .
sorry about that .
fortunately , i can provide you ... with another normal college experience ... in which the roommate kicks you out in the name of [ grunts ]
higher education .
can i just get my
come back in two .
minutes?
hours .
we'll be following the first daughter through her entire

i'm notsaying the first daughter dresses badly ... but today , apparently goodwill donated some clothes , so i think that
with guaranteed results .
ifyou have ring around the toilet
i llegal motion .
take a look at this .
with embroidery on the sleeves .
with embroidery around the neck .
with a front closure .
it's verybeautifully done .
soft , all lines .

and a slight shoulder pad .
and the mandarin neckline .
this works great with , uh , our tank top .

he has got too many secret service following me around .

it's not a good time .
fine .
just tell him i'll ditch the whole college thing and become a hooters girl .
good benefits , i hear .
sir?
yeah , it's liz .
there is a precedent for reduced security .
i recommend cutting back from four agents to two per shift .
keep detail on the floor , but not stationed at the room .
sir , she's miserable .
okay .
be right back .
man .
i came this close to wearing that exact bikini today .
dad , ifyou wantyour daughter to have any friends , we need to make some changes .

dad , when chelsea was at stanford , her secret service backed off .
they blended in .

on behalfofthe redmond knights , i wanna thank each and every one ofyou .
what we do on the field would not be possible ... without whatyou do offthe field .
are you al i ri ght?
okay , i need backup .
i real ly i i ke this guy .
what happened to all the ones you've been kissing since school started?
when i really like a guy , it means i'm not gonna kiss him .
all right .
long story short , we went to school together ... and i've loved him ever since spandex was in .
i asked him to meet me here tonight , but ...
i never thought he would .
your offensive captain, john young .
give it up forbig buck rich on defense .
hi , samantha .
welcome to redmond .
nice to meet you .
excuse me .
it's always about you , sam .
mia , wait .

hey , i'll seeyou later , all right?
## [ woman singing hip hop ]
## [ continues ]
so , mia , did you talk to her about rushing yet?
not yet .
hey , did you invite her to our party?
you still wanna invite her afterwhat happened at the last one?
are we supposed to salute orsaythe pledge ofallegiance?
hands off the roommate's personals .
only i can touch 'em .
dude , can't believe we're partying in , like , dorm room one .
hey , mia , what's she like?
get to see her naked?
can we all just stand in line to kiss her ass?
i'm so sick of all things samantha .
does she have a boyfriend?
she is so hot .
oh, yeah .
i don't believe that's any ofyour business .
## [ continues , indistinct ]
what's going on , mia?
what's going on is this isn't working out .
it's too hard .
is it thatyou don't like living with all the attention , mia?
orthatyou don't like living without it?
excuse me?
i thinkyou're used to being the center ofthings .
as a matter offact , i am .
naturally .
normally .
whatyou got going on is a whole lot of genetic limelight .
i think thatyou're acting really unreasonably right now .
sowhy don'twejust step outside .
maybe calm down .
no , i'm not counting to 1 0 .
i'm notwriting up some itinerary .
right here , right now , let's have this out .
and for once , sam , say something thatyou wanna say ... and not what someone wrote foryou .
just beyou .
whoever that is .
this from a woman who will kiss anyone with lips ... but saves abstinence for the one person she really cares about?
well , you know what?
at least i can admit i'm messed up .
you're so desperate to make everybody like you , you let people use me to get toyou ... and then you act like you don't see what's happening .
you let people useyou , regardless ofwhether i am around , mia .
you make that choice all ofthe time ... so don't blameyour genetically lit roommate .
and don't draw on my parents .
it's not nice .
## [ woman singing hip hop ]

oh , my god .
you real ly shouldn't sleep in that position .
it's bad for your neck .
i deserve it .
i'm the devil .
see?
oh , you are .
i wouldn't wanna be friends with me either .
mm mmm .
reduced security or not .
i just have to face it .
my life will never be normal .
and what exactly is so bad about that?
the last time i had privacy i was in utero .
imagine what it's like to have yourwhole life picked out foryou .
imagine ... never being alone and always feeling lonely .
all i everwanted was to get mykey ... get in a beat up little volkswagen , and drive offto college .
you think i'm a silly , spoiled kid , completely devoid of gratitude .
actually , i think i completely understand what you're going through .
you do?
this one time , i won the class spelling bee .
i couldn't get from point " a " to point " b " without people watching my every move .
i had to avoid the press , the paparazzi .
and the women .
my god , the women , sam .
the number of training bras that were left in my locker ... could fill the support needs of an entire country .
so , listen , about last night .
you're my r. a. it's forbidden .

mydad used to take me to a spot like this .

he must be proud ofyou .
yeah , ifhe was , he definitelywouldn't say so .
let's sayyou do pleaseyour father ... and you are completely successful and completely self reliant ... and you know that he's proud ofyou .

because then you'd actually have to figure out whatyou want .

was there anybody who didn't know except for me?
i feel so humiliated .
do you know that every day i get ... at least a half a dozen threats against you every day?
as your father , i couldn't live with myself if something ever happened to you .
as a president ... this country can't afford to have anything happen toyou right now .
what could i do , sam?
what choice did i have?
you had the choice to be honest with me .
you had the choice not to lie to me as my father and as the president .
oh , man .
hon , i knowyou thought he was your friend .
ifyou want , [ inhales ] we can replace him .
won't he lose his job?
he'll be transferred from first family detail , but no .
no find another position .
but not the right position .
he's in line to work for me .
and , yeah , that's where most agents want to end up .
no .
he can stay .
i really hope someday you understand this .
i do .
that is what is so disappointing .
i thought i'd finally found someone who'd like me for me .
so how doyou know his feelings foryou weren't real?
hewas just doing his job .
that's crap .
hewanted you .

what are you doing here?
what have you been doing here?
been a three point drop in the polls ... since your little table dance .

you've gotta know that we are in the race of our lives .
we were elected to set an example .
they expect more of us .
that's the life we've chosen .
i didn't choose anything , mom .
and i didn't run for anything .
nobody elected me , remember?
like it or not , chosen or not ... you are the daughter ofthe president ofthe united states .

mackenzie !
we're here to discussyourproposed removal as a disciplinary action .
your record is exceptional , but looking at this report ...
i have my doubts about your abi i ity to conti nue as an agent .
i understand .
so please tell this panel why we should allow you to continue as an agent .
my fatherwas an agent .
and my grandfatherwas before  but they're not the ones underreview here .
you are .
and ifyou had a different father or grandfather , you wouldn't have this opportunity .
you know , as a little kid ...
i always dreamt about standing on the sidelines ofhistory , protecting others maybe even the president himself .
well , i had the opportunity to protect a pretty remarkable person .
do you have anything to say to defend your actions?
you trainedme to expect the unexpected .
and i tried ... not to feel anything .
i tried to keep my distance ... but i ... fell deeper ... and deeper .
ifhaving those feelings means losing myjob ... then that's a loss i am prepared to take .
you and i know that mistakes made in our line ofwork could mean someone's life .
so i'm sorry .
you'll be on suspension pendingyourremoval ... andyou shouldstart to think about other alternatives .
have we confirmed these numbers?
and did she sign for them?
well , the only thing  well , that's why we chose this venue .
new hampshire worked , right?
we 're not in new hampshire anymore .
most people want to hear about foreign markets .
pardon me .
hey .
how are you doin '?
good .
you okay?
sam ... you're unhappy .
i get it .
but ifyou're going to be here , be here .
because there's a lot at stake ... and i really need you to act like a grown up right now .
obviously , i understand there is a lot at stake , dad .
i have been standing byyour side with mom my entire life .
that's why i came home .
you don't have to tell me how important it is to be with the peopleyou love .
i am here .
ifyou want me to be a grown up , then you have to allow it .
what's goin 'on with sam?
uh
what is it?
well ... rememberwhen she was little and she found that frog ... and we wouldn't let her keep it ... and she got that really stubborn little ... unbelievably cute look on her face?
yes .
she just made that face again .
man .
here i am about to go onstage she puts her old man in his place .

with all due respect , now that we've just taken direct hits ... on the domestic agenda , and it's the last push before the election
it's too late to change our position .
i don't thinkwe should address it .
