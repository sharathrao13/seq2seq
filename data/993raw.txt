work harder !
keep on !
cut !
wake up !
even extras are actors .
we're not making a ghost film now .
though you guys play the roles of pedestrians , but your roles still have life an soul .
especially we've chance to act with the kungfu actress queen cuckoo tu ... so we should grasp this chance .
act smartly , ok?
action !
cut !
who are you?
i'm an actor .
aunt ha !
yes .
who is this guy?
an extra .
i'm an actor .
are you mistaken?
how can you let him touch my machine?
sorry , brother sunny , i just went to toilet . so i asked him to do the rehearsal .
find someone who knows how to act , we need one urgently .
let me do it .
you?
show me the expression of " nervous " .
there're several kinds of nervous expression .
the one on the face of a husband whose wife is delivering a baby .
the baby is given birth .
but the wife is dead .
the baby calls him dad , he's a genius .
his dick is on his head , he's abnormal .
he wins mark six ... first prize !
his son is dead ...
his wife comes back to life .
his wife comes back to life .
no more response , if one is struck too hard emotionally ... he will enter a state of mental coma , he'll show no response .
is there another guy?
aunt ha , what have i done wrong?
i don't know what you were doing .
was there anything wrong with my expression?
i've said i didn't know what you were doing .
aunt ha , none of your extras is smart enough .
all these extras are above standard .
sunny , is it done?
everyone is waiting .
ok ... director , it'll soon be done ...
you , go and change your clothes .
thanks .

according to the character of my role .
i want to play my role with a bit naughtiness ...
but contradiction .
will this be better?
ok , speed .
speed .
scene 3 .
shot 4 , take 1 .
action !
cut !
what is it?
what's wrong with the guy behind .
he's supposed to be dead .
what are you doing?
aunt ha !
what is it?
brother sunny?
what is your extra up to?
how come you are still alive?
as i said i'd play my role with a bit naughtiness .
so subconsciously i don't want to die yet .
you must pretend to be dead .
actually , i was dying .
if you give me a bit more time , i'll die eventually .
do you know how many frames of film are there in one second?
24 frames , sister cuckoo .
do you know how long is the shot just then?
i guess it about one minute .
do you know as you didn't want to die ... that you've wasted how many seconds , how many frames and how much money and how much time and effort of everyone here?
are you fooling around here?
i'm begging you , you'd better find a professional extra for this role .
get someone smarter and shoot again !
you'd better be smart !
go home and think about when exactly you want to die .
ok , brother sunny .
aunt ha , what have i done wrong?
don't ask me again , i really don't know what you were doing .
then i ...
get lost .
you remind me i must go to a meeting of neighbour welfare association .
i'll be right back .
you don't have to come back .
i'm begging you , stop making trouble .
let the director watch your performance?
director , what kind of performance?
you are shot to dead , ready .
action !
was it ok , director?
this is it , go and change your clothes .
go ahead .
thanks ...
where did you learn acting , man?
i've never learnt it .
you're a real genius .
you can make it if you work hard .
why are you still standing here?
fuck off !
what are you doing here?
unit manager , i want to get a lunch box only .
it's not yet lunch time .
as i'm leaving now , so i ...
then you just go !
do you know why it's not yet lunch time?
just because of you , bastard , you didn't want to die !
and now everyone is working and starving .
i haven't eaten as well !
do you want to have lunch?
share your lunch with that puppy !
shit , you're a dump of shit .
your life is cheaper than ants .
i ride a mercedes , you pick your nostril .

dear fellows .
the play " thunder storm " is adapted from a well known chinese classic literature .
you guys all know it well .
tomorrow , i'll be leading actor , you guys want to see it , right?
so , i'll see you guys tomorrow then .
kelly , is there anything to do after dinner tomorrow?
taking a dump .
come and watch uncle san's play after taking a dump , it'll be fun .
remember to bring your dad and mom too .
if they don't come , you can cry , spit around .
do whatever you can until they come , then you'll be a good girl .
i pamper you , kelly .
kelly , if i don't see you tomorrow .
you'll result like this doll .
you get that?
uncle chi , the play " thunder storm " will be on show tomorrow night .
have you studied the script well?
yes , don't worry .
i can even compose a song .
old master sings whenever he sees the maid .
you're beautiful ...
uncle chi , i'm the one who sing the theme song .
and the role of " old master " you play is a chinese as well .
when the maid sees the old master , she will sing ...
you're so handsome , you're so smart ...
thank you much , please to ...
uncle chi , please don't ...
i accept you ...
are you ok?
think positive , uncle chi .
someone helps me , come on .
master hung , morning .
my play " thunder storm " will soon be showing .
shall we make another rehearsal?
do i need to rehearsal?
thunder storm " is about righteous , i knew it .
we're triad society member , we only talk about two things .
first , about righteous , second , about money .
i'll talk about righteous first .
righteous " is good , but we mustn't ignore the love line of the story .
because the role you play will finally be struck to death .
talking about " struck " , let me tell you ...
there are two kinds of " struck " in our world .
first , it is " dragging " .
second is " stabbing " .
look , this scar was dragged by knife .
while " stabbing " is like this .
this scoundrel is new comer , sorry , he shows no expression .
stabbing " is like this .
be serious , let us know if you feel the pain , ok?
your acting is lousy .
brother sau , teaching him for me .
talking about " pain " ... according to stanisslavski , master of acting from russia .
pain is transmitted from your body to the inside , and outside again .
let try one more time .
look , it's much better this time .
isn't it?
he acts much better now .
let's try one more time .
right , a little bit more , more , being stabbed .
maybe i can help you this way .
this is working , tears come out now .
look clearly , remember this expression , remember this feeling .
do remember this , get it?
let's go .
what about own " thunder storm " tomorrow .
no rehearsal needed for " thunder storm " .
we will come for sure , promise is a promise !
i'll bring hundreds of people to watch your play as well .
it's a deal .
just don't worry .
faster .
get into position .
granny , you stepped on someone .
i didn't step on anyone .
you just couldn't feel when you stepped on him , look at his foot .
yes , he's sweating as well .
give me some money and i'll send him to the hospital .
i have no money .
look at him , he's dying .
i only have $100 left .
give me , that $100 .
let's move !
granny , you've dropped some money .
really good luck .
sir ...

you're really a student?

it's your luck , uncle .
let's play 'chai fist '?
i don't know how to play it .
you don't know 'chai fist '?
have you been educated?
fanny , come here .
your belly is really big !

your parents are dead or something?
chai fist ', bingo !
triangle , rectangle , four !
good , i'll drink !
tonight is college girls 'first love evening .
so please mind your words , do behave like a student girl .
if clients complain about you again , then i can't help you anymore .
what college girl?
just a damned trick .
if i can be a college girl , i won't be working here .
you believe you did nothing wrong?
mamasan , the man at table 7 is really ugly .
i can't stand it and i am not doing business with him .
do you all want to be selecting on clients?
no ...
you're too much .
you are not professional , you can concentrate on one single .
one single spot?
if that man is ugly , you needn't look at him .
if his ears are pretty , just stare at his ears .
if his mouth is ugly but the teeth are nice , just look at his teeth .
so you new comer are really ignorant .
let me deal with him .
come on , watch what i'll do .
be smart .
hi !
you're pretty .
what's your name , boss?
my name is pierre .
it's a french name .
are everyone says i look like a frenchman , so i get a french name .
if you can't pronounce that well , just call me pi or erre .
what's on?
you used to be proud , now you get a lesson .
you can't blame me , he's a real rarity .
have you seen anyone put a cockroach on his head?
what's the problem?
look at lulu , she's playing with that cockroach now .
i admit failure .
ok , from now on , you won't have clients to sit at .
you'll be bored to death .
you're all like this .
connie , come and teach her for me .
you're not amateur , you should know you must act in front of clients .
but your problem is : you acting stinks .
i can do nothing about it .
i hear someone teaches acting for free .
i'll take you to see him .
teaches acting?
hey , men .
yes !
hurry up , start working .
you again?
morning , brother sunny .
aunt ha !
i'm looking for him too .
i haven't given you a notice , what brings you here?
remember last time that you asked me to think about the ways to die .
i've thought over and i have some new ideas now , and i believe my performance will make you satisfied .
i would have killed you in the past .
talking about knife , it's different from a gun .
the position of the wound is usually under the armpit , here .
the wound is a bit bigger , and the face will twist more .
if you're betrayed by your own friends , you will even ...
i didn't expect ... it's you ...
get lost !
brother sunny , i ...
i just want to act , give me a chance please .
do you love standing here?
ok , stand here , i won't pay you a dime .
i'll act even if you don't pay me , i only want a lunch box .
but lunch box costs money too , beat it !
sunny .
what is it , martial art director?
it's bad to use this mannequin to disguise as a dead man .
figure it out , we're in a hurry !
yes , ok ... got it .
thank you , brother sunny .
only a lunch box .
no problem , should i put some make up on?
put it on now .
director , the actors are ready .
actors are all ready .
action !
cockroach ...
let's help sister cuckoo .
cockroach !
go to hell !
sister cuckoo , don't be afraid .
sister cuckoo , don't be afraid , it's ok now .
director , can we cut now?
it's still running?
cut !
ok .
are you ok?
must you do all these to kill a cockroach !
let's see if he's alright?
i'm fine , sister cuckoo , thanks for your concerns .
why don't you move at all?
i didn't move since director hasn't shouted 'cut 'yet .
so i mustn't move .
do you hear that ...
he keeps on acting since the director hasn't shouted 'cut 'yet .
this is what i always tell you : professionalism .
what's your name?
i'm called wan tin sau .
yee , give him a cup of coffee .
yes .
get his phone number for me .
yes .
you ... work in my team from now on .
thanks , sister cuckoo .
is this shot ok?
yes .
weapon comes .
sunny .
yes .
i am telling you , even extras are important .
the one who played the father , we mustn't use him again .
got it , sister cuckoo .
sister cuckoo , i am the one who played the father .
in fact , it is like this ...
fine ...
let me clean it for you , towel , get the towel .
sister cuckoo !
watch out !
sister cuckoo , are you alright?
don't touch .
don't touch !
very pretty .
sister cuckoo !
security guard , is there someone here who teaches acting?
i've been in the field of art for ages .
whether it's movie or tv , i'm experienced .
i was the creative director in amusement park theatre .
so i can sing and dance .
you mean you are the instructor here?
well , many people here love theatre and play .
they love studying plays with me .
those people introduce us here indeed .
ok , this way please .
it's you?
didn't you play in that film ... that ...
the stupid man standing behind , falls after stepping on a banana peel?
you noticed my performance too?
you idiot !
only an idiot will fall after stepping on a banana peel .
why don't you go dying?
thanks .
are you really that stupid?
you're flattering me .
you damned extra , you are ...
in fact , i am an actor .
that way please .
damned extra .
what can i do for you?
frankly , we're hostesses of a night club .
i can tell .
we're holding " college girls 'first love evening " right now .
these girls dare to say they don't have the feeling of first love at all .
how can you work like this?
first love was shown at the stage when we where babies .
say , when a baby sees a comforter , he wants to suck it .
this is a kind of love .
why did you suck a comforter?
you damned extra .
in fact , i am an actor .
well , so why did you talk about sucking a comforter?
i'm going to explain everything to you .
ok , let's explain it .
i love you , i hate you , etc .
it'll be more impressive if you have some tears in your eyes .
just like this .
do you see?
that teardrop ...
good , the teardrop is inside the eyes .
where is the teardrop?
you damned extra .
in fact , i am an actor .
you might need something to help you since you've no experience , and the simplest way is to eat wasabi .
wasabi?
what are you talking about?
must we be fooled by this damned extra?
miss , if you must call me an extra , you don't need to add 'damned 'in front of it .
in fact , being club girls ...
if you can show some respect to the others , then ...
what are you calling us?
excuse me .
forget it , we are club girls indeed .
i just don't like him calling me that way .
she's always like this , never mind her .
it's ok ...
i've asked you not to stir up trouble !
it's ok ...
it's ok ...
why must you still behave like this?
don't panic , it's alright .
don't panic , it's alright .
club girls?
it's alright ... don't panic , take it easy , it's alright .
how could i know he's so amusing?
i brought you there as i thought he charged for nothing .
if you hadn't block my way , i'd have ...
please , beware what you say to the clients .
go out ...
i'm sorry .
what's going on?
this is a big night club .
get lost , i'm sorry .
are there other hostesses?
yes , they're coming soon .
connie , come here .
what is it , mama debra?
master lung is here and he's drunk .
he thought he's being dumped and he wants his first lover back .
all the girls here are college girls , they'll suit him .
look , he has scanned almost all my girls .
but none of them suits his taste , he's nuts .
look at his money , it's piled up .
have you gone inside?
not yet .
wait here for a while .
go and send some more girls here .
i have so much money .
come and get it if you can .
i want my first lover .
first lover !
you wanna try?
i'll give it a shot , sometimes it's hard to tell the taste of a rich man .
get lost .
hurry up , be smart .
master lung , here come the beauties .
say hi to master lung .
boss .
get lost !
master lung , don't get mad .
go away !
none of them is pretty !
they are not sincere , i want my first lover !
first lover ...
they're all here for money !
i am sincere .
i really love you .
mary , i'll give you anything you want .
i can give you all the money on the table ... as long as you don't leave me , mary .
what is it?
are you alright?
i've hit you hard , sorry .
if that table wasn't there and i could kick you ,
i wouldn't have been defeated by you .
i'm not here to fight with you , i'm here to learn acting from you .
go away .
to some honest friends who have the same interest as i do .
i'll be more than willing to teach them .
just a second .
i'm coming , 1 , 2 , 2 and a half , 3 .
must it take you so long for make up?
you damned ...
don't again !
your tie is high classed .
thanks .
since i've taken your money , i should act accordingly .
where's the ping pong racket?
under the table .
there're many people here , let's go over there .
i'm wan tin sau , and you?
lau piu piu .
what do you want to learn?
how to pamper those bastards in the night club .
the first love feeling of college girls must be built from the base .
you can take me as your client , and greet me first .
boss , want some fist games?
don't call me " boss " , you're college girl now .
you can say good morning , or morning , sir .
good morning , sir .
try to lower your head a little bit , pretend to be shy .
let your client touches your chin and raise your head and then say .
morning , sir .
your regards are bad , again .
give me glistened regards .
morning , sir .
too glistened now , i'll faint , again .
take it easy .
morning , sir .
these are eyes of dead body , you'll scare others to death .
again .
be natural .
morning , sir .
good !
now let's discuss about your action , say , hugging .
hug me with your way .
what for?
what for?
you needn't lock others with your thigh every time .
sorry , my job requires this .
you must stop doing that .
being a college girl , you needn't always take initiation .
you can act shyly so that men will hug you .
what do you mean by shy?
like this .
like biting a quail?
act on .
right , when men see you biting a quail , they'll naturally hold and hug you .
now you can put your head on their shoulders .
what for?
excuse me , my job requires this .
you must stop doing that !
superficially it's all .
if we go further , i must then ask you about your first love .
i never have first love .
everyone has first love .
i said i never have one .
you must have some unforgettable memory .
no .
or you must have heard someone say something you can never forget .
never !
i hope i can be with you forever .
promise me , let me take care of you for the rest of your life .
then you must have unforgettable experience .
never !
being club girl?
didn't say you'll take care of me?
how come i have money if you don't work as club girl?
how can i take care of you if i have no money?
now , imagine i'm your first boyfriend lover .
sau , on the night of your play , i was engaged in a transaction .
so i was too busy to come , sorry .
was there good response?
sure .
it's good then .
i will surely come next time .
someone're shooing kids karaoke , you aren't one of them?
i've things to see you , excuse me .
take me new boy to collect protection money for me .
help me improve his appearance ...
about the way he speaks?
right , that's it , you won't refuse my request , right?
thanks for teaching me .
over there .
being a triad member ... you must have a unique appearance .
it's right you have a gold chain with you .
you must try to look furious and severe .
try it .
more furious .
show some anger .
wrath .

you know , hk is in economic recession .
and being hit by financial storm , it's all because of the 'ross '.

persistence , aunt ha .
i believe that i'm a good actor , do me a favour please .

no problem , i'll try my best to be the stunt man for sister cuckoo .
director , no problem .

as you like ,
as long as you don't turn your face to the camera , get it?
got it .
light the fire , just don't move .
ready .
who put the pigeons here?
director , i put them here intentionally .
there're pigeons here in our last shot .
if the pigeons fly , they'll stir up the fire .
take them away .
director ...
the mood of this shot will be better if the pigeons are there .
how much better?
it's hard to say , it's something abstract .
anyway , the mood will be better .
put them up and let's see the effect .
that stunt man mustn't turn his head !
director , how do you like it?
it's a bit better .
let's try the effect with the pigeon's head towards me .

aren't extras human?
why must you always jump in me?
you want to know the reason?
i want to know the reason .
because you're not entitled to eat this lunch box !
you thought you're talented and teach others acting .
you always talk about theory .

you talk about 'acting 'in front of me?
