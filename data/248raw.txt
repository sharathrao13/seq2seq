500 years had passed , and still the country remained closed .
cut off from the world , knowing neither hope nor despair ... ... the land breathed an air of quiet stagnation .
reformers driven to armed rebellion ... ... had been suppressed by the state .
the house of takemikazuchi ... ... were assassins hired to suppress the rebels .
from ancient times ... ... they had been guards to the rulers of a neighboring kingdom .
that country , modernizing , had overthrown its monarch .
driven into exile , they had reached this land .
now they were a tribe of assassins ... ... who would kill anyone they were paid to .
the takemikazuchi ...
mother ...
byakurai wants you .
anka fled this morning .
he who flees the takemikazuchi is a traitor who will sell our secrets .
he's headed across shikon mountain .
but with his leg , he won't have reached the old mine yet .
yuki ... ... take kiri with you .
i'll go alone .
i'll go !
he'll slow me down .
take me with you !
byakurai told you to !
could you really kill anka?
yes .
what if he begged?
i'd still kill him !
i don't think so .
yuki ... it's you ...
i'm unarmed .
don't kill me .
please ...
take my sword .
tell them you killed me , ok?
i see i'm no match for you any more , yuki .
who are you?
my name is kuka .
i served your mother .
i have something to tell you .
it's about who killed your mother .
you were told she died in an attack ... ... but it was byakurai who killed her .
liar !
byakurai killed your mother azora ... ... princess takemikazuchi .
you must either take revenge and succeed to your mother's place ... ... or leave .
tomorrow you turn 20 .
on that day a princess assumes leadership of the takemikazuchi .
you must choose either to take over the house ... ... or to leave it .
if you choose to leave , come to the old mine .
i have delivered the message of azora .
did anka beg for his life?
did my mother beg for hers?
what do you mean?
your voice is shaking .
your mind's racing .
are you aware what you're doing?
tell me .
byakurai ... did you kill my mother?
no .
put up your sword , yuki .
i'll overlook this .
i didn't want to tell you .
your mother was killed because she meant to betray us and flee .
liar !
lashing out won't help !
i have no choice .
die !
wonderful news from the union assembly .
under our great leader , we are winning the production war .
the ministry of consumption reports ... ... living standards have risen 20 per cent over the past year .
celebrating this news the citizens have come out into the streets ... ... in a spontaneous parade .
aya?
what is it?
is this to kill me with?
you're a takemikazuchi , aren't you .
who hired you?
talk .
where are the others?
there's no one else coming .
i'm not here to kill you .
liar .
you think i believe that?
trust me .
trust you?
you guys kill anyone you're paid to .
if i trust you i'll end up dead .
if i was after you ... ... you'd be dead now .
trust me?
doesn't that hurt?
yes ... ... if you let it .
i saw a girl .
where is she?
i'm alone here .
that's my bed .
good night .
we lost her at the road through the forest zone .
you came back to tell me that?
no .
someone saw a truck .
we'll watch the road .
she'll be back .
she wants revenge .
someone told her .
who?
hmm ..
yuki's 20 today .
whoever told her about azora knew that , and what it means .
kuka ...
so you think she wants to kill you to avenge azora?
that means she'll come here .
if kuka wanted to talk to yuki , where would he call her to?
to his home?
i'd find a better place than that .
how have you been?
it's kidokoro .
i'm back .
there's something i want to talk to you about .
i'll come today . '
no .
i'll come to you ...
... the day after tomorrow .
roger .
i'll be waiting at the usual place .
a man had pledged with azora , heir to the house of takemikazuchi .
he swore fealty to the house ... ... but byakurai framed him as a traitor and killed him .
that man was my father?
you wouldn't remember .
you'd only just turned two .
there were still many of takemikazuchi blood .
byakurai sought to marry azora himself ... ... and make the house of takemikazuchi his .
but azora refused .
discouraged , she sought to bring the takemikazuchi to an end .
byakurai found out and killed her .
then everything changed .
many were unhappy with byakurai , and tried to leave .
but only very few ... ... managed to escape .
princess azora was killed here .
i'm sure she hoped you would leave the takemikazuchi .
she wanted you to succeed where she had failed .
you need not take revenge on byakurai .
the fate of the takemikazuchi is to disappear .
princess yuki ...
your mother had been tortured almost to death ... ... but the final blow came from me .
kill me if you will .
my life since then has been one of waiting for this day .
i offered to accompany her to the next world ... ... but she wouldn't allow it .
i was commanded to tell you everything ... ... when you reached 20 years of age .
if princess yuki were to do me the honor of killing me ...
don't say that .
there's no point .
so it was you , kuka ...
soma ...
my , how you've grown !
by your leave ...
kuka !
this is what i wanted !
princess yuki !
don't die !
kill me if you want ... ... but don't raise your blades against princess yuki !
that i can't promise .
kuka !
when i was small ... ... i was always happy .
i never dreamed ... ... things would turn out like this .
you know why people thought that way then?
it's because no one had any ideals .
yes , people died when we put a bomb in the assembly .
but it was very effective .
you should be proud .
it was a holiday .
no one was supposed to be there .
you told me that .
losses are inevitable .
you don't get something for nothing .
mimura knew that .
his death wasn't wasted .
no one pays any attention unless a few dozen citizens die .
i'd like to move on to the next project .
mr sugimoto ... ... didn't think so .
he called you while i was gone?
last month .
he's been expelled .
i trust you .
we have to do whatever's necessary to achieve our ideals .
