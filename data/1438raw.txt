joey nova is crazy .
he said he'd cut me up if i didn't keep my mouth shut .
you'll give us joey .
where do we find him?
he's usually hanging around on the boardwalk .
by the old casino .
i don't know .
suppose we pretend to believe this fuck ... ... you wanna get a description of this joey?

hey , gina .
what are you doing here?
i just wanted to come take a shower or something .
did you kill that guy?
what?
what guy?
the guy you stole the $4000 from .

i didn't steal $4000 .
that's not what spyder says .
spyder?
yeah , the guy worked for spyder .
and your friend snake turned himself in .
fuck .
yeah .

i didn't mean to do it .
he came after me .
i didn't take his money .
what have you done?
i don't know .
are you staying clean?
trying .
gina .
you gotta get out of here .
spyder's been hassling me , looking for you .
all right .
what are you gonna do?
i don't know .
i gotta get out of here .
maybe get some money and ... ... then maybe i'll go to key west or something .
then i could send for you .
i don't have the dough right now , but
i'm skimming at work just to get by .
no , i didn't mean from you .
yeah , sure , joey .
here .
here .
no , no .
look ... ... l got this for you .
so maybe i'll see you in florida .
all right?
bye .
here you go , herb .
don't let the cops catch you drinking .
one of them lives here .

he's an asshole .
cheap with his liquor .
long beach got a positive ld on the chevy nova .
it's registered to joey lamarca .
my joey?

come on , vince .
lieutenant , you all right?
joey's my son .
his mother and me are divorced .
i'm sorry .
put a warrant out for him .
get a search warrant for that casino where he hangs out .
keep checking with traffic for the chevy nova .
i'm gonna go see his mother .
cover the back , just in case he's in there .
who is it?
it's vince .
can i come in?
i'm sorry .
it's late .
what do you want?
you know where joey is?
why?
he's in trouble .
i think he might've killed somebody .
you know this or you just think it?
i'm pretty sure .
i know a very good lawyer .
he was with the d. a.
really?
i'm gonna give him a call .
so let me get this straight .
you walk out 1 4 years ago and now you come back giving orders .
our son is in trouble .
we don't have a son .
i do .
nothing here belongs to you .
learn a new song to sing .
you walked out on joey .
not on him .
i walked out on you .
what's the difference?
i'm trying to help .
you came here to arrest your own son .
lf he's responsible .
he'll have to face up to it .
that's funny .
you , talking about facing responsibilities .
you ran away .
anything got too close , you ran to your job .
tell him he's better off turning himself in to me .
you think i trust you to bring him in?
you wife beater !
you have to bring that up .
you had as much to do with it as i did .
there was never violence in my family .
not like the lamarcas !
you can't save him by saying it runs in the family .
he made a choice to be there and kill .
like you made a choice to be a bitch .
okay , vince , you got it off your chest .
nothing more to say now?
so go .
just tell him he's better off turning himself in to me .
hey , where you been?
i thought you got shot or something .
i'm sorry , i should've called .
are you all right?
rough day .
ls something wrong?
i'm just tired .
i just don't feel like
i just don't feel like talking .
okay .
chief .
close the door .
this is commissioner johnson and vanessa hansen from the mayor's office .
actually , deputy assistant mayor .
take a seat , vince .
we wanted to meet you , see how to spin this for the media .
spin what?
they know about your old man , vince .
we need a story on how the son of an executed child murderer was ...
... promoted to homicide detective .
one of the best .
the best .
of new york's finest .
my father didn't kill the kid .
it was a stupid accident .
yes , but the 1 1 : 00 news will be all over this .
we want to be ready .
they'll want to know how you got started .
i didn't kill the kid .
but you were hired by police captain mcauley , your father in law ...
... who shepherded you into homicide .
what about him?
he arrested my father and he took a big , big chance with me .
i know .
i'm just saying that this is how the media will frame it .
after the execution , i had nothing .
that cop saved me , taught me everything .
he was the kindest guy i ever met .
make that part of your story .
detective lamarca is in no way responsible .
he's had a long and honorable career despite his father's violent past
he wasn't violent .
what is this? " and that of his son .
excuse us .
" he has fought criminals ....
something like that?
yeah , that would work .
i have to take you off the case .
i should reassign you too , reg .
i want him on it .
it's your call .
i don't know .
i want joey brought in safe .
i know you'll do that .
okay , all right .
rossi !
you're working with reg on this .
take the rest of the week off .
i don't need a week off , sir .
this isn't a democracy .
i'll take you home .
put my ex wife's place under surveillance .
a wiretap too .
he may have killed a guy .
it's easier the second time .
you know that .
whatever you have to do , you'll always have my respect and friendship .
i'll do everything to bring him in safe .
you want company?
how come you're not at work?
took a few days off .
i'm not used to seeing you in the daylight .
i look different?
i'm sorry about yesterday .
i'm sorry i didn't call you .
well , we're not in high school , right?
i just had a tough day , you know?
no , actually , i don't know .
i just don't like talking about work , that's all .
okay .
you got your place , i got mine .
no complications , and that's okay .
i'm 43 years old , i like to keep it simple .
i don't want to marry you .
i just want to know you .
i think i know you , then something happens ... ... and i realize i don't know you at all .
you gonna say anything?
what's there to say?
it's my problem , not yours .
why make it yours?
you see?
that's exactly what i mean .
what's up?
i got something for you .
how much you looking for?
at least a grand .
i need some traveling money .
where you going?
florida .
really?
what you gonna be doing down there?
well , my old man manages a hotel down there .
he'll get me a job tending bar .
one of those beach bars .
you know , palm trees .
right on the fucking sand .
i'll give you a grand for your nova .
how will i get to florida?
i can't sell my nova .
this is all shit .
look , i got a silver plated . 45 .
bring me the piece , we'll talk money .
see you later .
dude , we never close , baby .
yeah?
mr. lamarca?
you joey lamarca's father?
who's this?
friend of joey's .
who are you?
i'm gina .
okay , come on in , gina .
sit down .
you want something to drink?
no .
so where's joey?
i don't know .
you don't know?
when was the last time you saw him?
i got something that belongs to joey .
i was thinking i'd leave it here with you .
it's just stuff joey saved .
kind of like a scrapbook , you know?
how did you know to come here?
joey brought me once .
one day he said he wanted to see you .
and where was l?
i don't know .
he chickened out .
wouldn't even push the doorbell .
just like joey .
he wouldn't let me either .
how do you get in touch with him?
i told you .
i don't know where he is .
keep asking questions like that , you'll have to read me my rights .
you live in long beach?
yeah .
i borrowed a friend's car to get here .
i gotta get it back .
you drove into the city just to give me this?
joe's gone .
that stuff was real important to him .
i didn't know what else to do with it , and his mother don't like me , so ....
so , what do you expect me to do?
just , like , be his dad , you know?
i gotta go .
i'm gonna get a ticket .
gina?
thank you .
sure .
i'll talk to you later , okay?
cheesecake?
that you?
that's me .
mom , dad?
connie .
his name was angelo .
he's handsome .
my old man was executed at sing sing in '59 ... ... for murder .
i was 8 .
what happened?
he was a moving man .
moved rich people into mansions out in locust valley .
somehow he got himself into debt .
i guess it was bad .
he had this idea to fix it .
kidnap a baby from a rich family .
leave a ransom note .
they'll pay , no sweat .
he kidnaps the baby .
while he's waiting for the ransom in his car ... ... the baby gets tangled in a blanket in the back seat and suffocates .
first murder in long beach , and it was my old man .
just a little kid , that must've been hell .
you get through anything when you have to , but it was ....
what kept me sane was the cop who arrested my old man kind of adopted me .
captain mcauley , he was a good guy .
but this ...
... is the ex wife?
yeah , that's maggie .
who's this?
that's my son , joey .
you have a son?
i'm sorry i lied to you when i said i didn't have any kids .
i'm sorry .
why did you lie to me?
i don't know .
i hadn't seen him in a long time .
the divorce was a mess .
maggie had been seeing this guy and ....
i don't know , i just ....
i lost control of the situation .
lost control? ls that cop talk?
we fought a lot , shouting and yelling .
but it never got physical .
and then one day , it did .
i lost control .
i , of course , regretted it .
but we never got over that .
on top of that , i think my son might've killed a guy the other night .
what?
i'm just trying to tell you everything .
yeah , okay .
okay .
why haven't you seen him?
i tried at first , but maggie made it difficult .
i had supervised visits with a social worker watching .
like i was a criminal .
like i was back going to prison to see my old man .
i couldn't take it .
so you just stopped seeing him?
not just like that .
maggie was also doing a number on him , so he didn't want to be around me .
i just walked away .
i quit .
maybe i should've tried harder .
i don't know .
why couldn't you tell me this before?
well , i ....
i don't know , i ....
that was me .
with you , it's different .
i didn't wanna ruin that .
are you all right?
yeah .
it's what i asked for , isn't it?
not so simple , huh?
no .
no , it's not .
i'm not your ex wife .
i won't judge you .
i never have , i won't start now .
but i've gotta think about this .
i've gotta think about this .
see you , okay?
gina , i want you to know i got a lot of respect for you .
the way you got your shit together for your kid .
i got no problem with you .
just tell me where joey is .
look , i don't know  don't !
i don't wanna hear it .
i'll tell you what .
i'll give you till 1 2 noon .
plenty of time to feed your kid , whatever you gotta do .
but after that , you find joey , okay?
yeah .
he's a good looking kid .
lamarca .
it's gina .
i need some money to pay the taxi .
all right , i'll be right down .
you okay?
no .
it's 52 bucks .
give him $60 , he's a nice guy .
who's this?
your grandson .
i try not to smoke around him .
sometimes it's just , you know ....
what's his name?
angelo .
we haven't eaten .
got anything to eat?
i'll make you something .
does joey help you out?
he would if he could , i guess .
how do you pay your rent?
workfare .
flipping hamburgers .
until they figure out i'm dipping in the register , which is any day now .
then i'll be totally fucked .
when did you see him last?
night before last .
said he was gonna get some money and go .
go where?
like he knows?
florida .
key west .
whenever he gets rabbity , he's going to florida .
like it's some magic country when it's only the dope capital of the world .
can i ask you a question without you getting mad?
depends .
when you left joey , was it hard?
very hard .
you miss him?
of course .
it get easier , you know , missing him after a while?
you just stop thinking about it .
put your head down , keep walking .
otherwise it'd be too difficult .
was it better for joey , you think , that you left?
for a while .
all i know is i missed out on stuff .
like what?
like teaching him about things .
like good music .
old movies .
not being afraid to fight .
stuff like that .
i guess what you want and what you can do are different things sometimes .
gina , i wanna help joey .
you can't help him .
you never did .
that's what he says .
i'm gonna go buy some smokes .
can i borrow a couple bucks?
yeah , my wallet is in the hall on that table .
you need anything?
no , thanks .
you don't mind watching angelo for a bit?
he'll be okay .
you be good .
mommy's gonna be right back .
his pampers and stuff are in the duffel .
duffy .
reg .

officer down .
officer down , long beach casino !
officer down !
rossi , what happened?
he was up there with a gun .
reg is over there .
oh , no .
jesus .
i'm sorry , lieutenant .
what happened?
they called for an assist but didn't wait .
you don't go in for a murder suspect without backup !
he said you and him were already here before together alone .
goddamn it , reg .
one question .
can i have a statement?
chief henderson .
lieutenant katt , long beach police .
crime scene is in here .
lt. lamarca !
chief wants to see you .
a. 45 caliber reported stolen from a clinic this morning .
suspect's name is joseph lamarca .
he's at
wait a minute .
not now .
you don't have enough to make joey the prime suspect .
i know it's your kid  evidence .
rossi didn't see it .
i didn't see it .
he didn't see anybody .
you said joey hung out here .
that was just a lead .
it doesn't prove anything .
this is an investigation .
i'm just saying you don't have enough to make him the prime suspect .
we got a fingerprint match on the murder weapon .
i'm sorry , lieutenant .
it's definitely your boy .
i'm here at the crime scene at the boardwalk ... ... where a detective was gunned down during a manhunt for joseph lamarca ... ... a murder suspect police consider armed and dangerous .
they're tearing the house apart .
they say joey killed some cop .
not some cop .
my partner .
i know what they'll do when they find him .
i know what cops do to cop killers .
one way or another , they'll find a way to kill him .
it's too late .
it's not his fault .
then whose fault is it?
did you pull the trigger?
he doesn't know what he's doing .
don't start with that .
you choose right or wrong .
he's got nobody to blame but himself .
please help him .
you're all he's got .
then he's got nothing .
please , help him !
don't walk away from him again !
himself the son of angelo lamarca , executed for a horrific murder in 1 959 .
this photo shows lamarca being booked for the murder of the baby ... ... who was strangled to death while lamarca attempted to collect the ransom .
marge .
here .
take these into the living room .
come on now .
come on .
i'm sorry it was your boy .
that'll be hard for you .
i'm sorry .
i'm just so sorry .
it's hard to believe reg will never be coming home again .
why did he do it , vince?
reg never would have hurt your boy .
it's just so wrong .
it's just ....
it's just so wrong .
i swear to god , if there's anything i can do ....
daddy , no !
bree's gonna miss him the most .
lamarca has had a long career with this department ... ... living down the tragedy of his father's past and that of his troubled ....
hi .
hi .
where's angelo?
asleep in your bed .
lamarca has been moved to a different case .
there they go .
the big story .
i don't know what to say .
i'm sorry , vincent .
i went to see reg's wife .
you know , all the other cops wouldn't look at me .
just like it was at school .
nobody says anything , but they think you're guilty too .
you can't blame yourself for everything .
ls joey my fault?
i don't know .
but you're not responsible for everything your son does .
he's gotta choose who he wants to be .
you think we get a choice?
we just pretend that we got a choice .
it's more like a sentence .
when my old man did what he did , i felt so bad , you know .
i felt like i was the criminal .
no way i'd feel that way again .
i'd be so good nobody could pin anything on me .
that was my choice .
but now , whether your dad is a cop or a murderer ... ... some kid's father's not coming home .
that's the real life sentence .
yeah .
so , what do we do , michelle?
want your keys back?
lamarca .
i didn't shoot that cop .
joey?
you hear me?
i didn't shoot him .
i didn't shoot him .
somebody did .
i just left the wife and daughter crying .
well , it wasn't me .
let's meet where we watched the planes .
what?
remember we used to watch the planes?
yeah .
remember where that was?
yeah .
i'll be there , just me .
why should i trust you?
joey , you don't have a choice .
i'll be there by myself , i promise .
please .
you gotta do it .
please .
all right .
you gonna meet him?
i hope so .
what are you looking at?
the van down there .
they're tapping the phone .
but you're on their side .
i don't think they see it i don't think they see it that way .
speak .
let's not play games .
sorry , chief .
why get cute about the meeting spot?
i know what happens if the wrong cop goes .
you got my word that nothing's gonna happen to joey .
your word is good with me . lf i can , i'll bring him in to you .
i gotta go .
there will be a lot of cops up here looking for me .
bring angelo to your place .
where are you going?
you can't say what you don't know .
you still watch those planes .
yeah .
i met angelo .
gina brought him over .
nice little kid .
because of gina , not me .
she won't let me see him .
she says i gotta stay away till i get clean .
which will be whenever .
i got this lawyer ready to meet with us .
you wanna take me in?
i wanna help .
did you hear me?
i didn't do the cop .
i come to talk to you , you bring up a lawyer .
you think maybe your lawyer could get me the electric chair?
fuck .
too weird , huh?
lf i got the chair too , just like your old man?
you ever think about him?
sure .
did you love him?
he was my father .
of course i did .
because someone's your father means you gotta love him?
you think i love you?
i don't know .
right .
you don't even know me , do you?
no , i guess i don't .
you wanna tell me?
you know i was quarterback in high school?
no .
your mother never told me anything .
i used to look for you in the stands .
i would've loved to see you play .
you should have .
i was good .
we beat cedarhurst in the county finals .
first time in 24 years .
the crowd went wild .
i didn't need drugs that night .
i was good then .
you should have seen me .
i wish i had .
all right , fuck it .
we all got reasons .
so you believe me about the cop , or what?
your prints are on the gun .
i wasn't there when the cop went down .
that cop had a name .
his name was reg .
so who was there?
fucking scumbag dealer named spyder .
he's after me for his fucking $4000 .
lf i had it , i'd be on a plane to florida .
did you see him?
no , i didn't see him do it but i saw him right after .
i mean right after . ln the alley there .
what about picasso?
i don't know .
look , i was fucked up ... ... he came at me with a knife ....
i guess , in a sense , i killed him .
ln a sense?
i don't know what happened .
one minute we're fighting and the next he's dead .
but that wasn't me .
all right?
that wasn't the real me .
i wouldn't count on a jury believing that .
this is something you can't run away from .
you can't .
you can't run .
do you believe me?
it doesn't matter what i believe .
plead self defense , you could get off with maybe six years .
what if it matters to me what you believe?
i gotta take you in , you know that .
what are you , a cop or my father?
i'm both .
i'm getting out of here .
what are you now?
joey , come on !
just fucking with you .
i knew the answer .
you know , when i was a kid , i wanted to be a cop .
i really did .
just like you .
chief .
where's your boy?
picasso worked for a dealer called spyder .
spyder's after joey for his $4000 .
joey told me he saw spyder in the alley by the casino after reg was hit .
why didn't you bring your boy in?
he told me he didn't kill reg .
you believed him?
i believed him .
he's your son , of course you wanna believe him .
i've been a cop 25 years  the operative word is " cop .
you're not sometimes a cop , sometimes a junkie's father .
you're either a cop or you're not a cop .
end of story .
this is bullshit .
you're under oath to perform your duty . ln this investigation
what investigation?
you already made your mind up .
peace , all right?
don't be playing no bullshit neither .
a motherfucking ghost .
how come you still breathing , casper?
listen .
a thousand dollars for my nova .
cops got your wheels , boy .
i'm sorry , man .
will you do me a solid here , please?
i need help .
please .
what's the ring?
it's a football ring .
it ain't for sale .
let me see .
this is worth like 1 00 , easy .
but i'm saving it for my son .
we'll treat it like a loan until i get you the 1 00 back .
yeah , sure .
all right .
here .
no , carl , i can't use this .
i need cash .
you'd be the first junkie who couldn't .
give me the ring .
back the fuck off !
you lucky i'm giving you anything !
please , the ring's important .
it's for my boy .
you ain't gonna be around to see your boy .
and you ain't going to florida .
you got spyder and the cops chasing you .
you a junkie !
only place you're going is the morgue .
county , motherfucker !
wait a minute !
what are you doing?
there's nothing in there for you .
want to come over and see my soup?
look , here's grandpa .
this is evelyn hancock .
she's an old friend .
you're a big boy , angelo .
evelyn is with child services .
what's going on?
she's taking angelo until gina comes back .
it's temporary .
she's not coming back .
i can't take care of him .
can i talk to you?
sure .
go see this nice lady .
i just wanna talk to him for a minute .
what are you doing?
what am i supposed to do?
take care of him .
you're his grandfather .
nice idea , but i can't .
vincent , gina's gone .
you think his father is coming back?
this is the best thing for him .
no , you're the best thing for him .
i can help you .
you never had kids , you don't know .
you're gonna walk away from him .
what do you mean , walking away?
like with joey .
i'm not walking away !
that's what you told me you did with joey .
i'm not walk away?
let me show you something .
let me show you something .
you think i want him growing up with this?
like the son of frankenstein?
you never know what he might do .
don't mention his father !
call it walking away , but i'm doing the best thing for him .
that is not about angelo .
that's about you .
you told me .
you told me you never had a choice , right?
well , you got one right here .
michelle , try to understand .
right now it's more than i can handle .
i can't do it .
that's how you make a choice .
goodbye .
morning .
let's try to wrap this up .
we got pretty substantial evidence .
fingerprints are clear .
there are no others on the gun .
shells and ballistics identify it as the shooter's .
we know he frequented the carousel and used drugs there .
excuse me , sir .
go ahead , dave .
a shoe print in the blood doesn't match lamarca's size .
so , what do we think?
that o. j. was there?
maybe bruno magli?
one last thing .
this kid has killed twice .
don't give him a chance to do it again .
we got that?
you got a phone call on my phone .
how come you're giving out my number?
i don't even know your number .
this guy knows it .
make sure you leave a nickel in the ashtray .
dave simon .
i couldn't call you direct .
what's going on?
i have something you should see .
could we meet at york and 59th street bridge?
it's copies of crime scene photos i tried to mention .
what are they?
footprints in the blood at the top of the ladder .
we can account for all of them ... ... except for one heel from a size 1 0 cowboy boot made by justin boots .
at your ex wife's we found some of joey's stuff .
joey wears a size 1 2 1 / 2 shoe .
there's no 1 2 1 / 2 prints anywhere in this blood .
i appreciate this .
well , you know , it doesn't all have to be bullshit .
you born in long beach?
no , army brat .
we lived all over .
distant climes , huh?
we traveled a lot .
now we got a baby .
i hardly get out .
kids change everything .
lsn't that the truth .
sir , listen , i'm real sorry about your son .
i appreciate it .
thank you very much .
i appreciate that .
it's more than i can handle .
we just pretend we got a choice .
we don't have a son , i do .
i wasn't gonna feel that again .
you think i love you?
i should've tried harder .
you said you never had a choice .
what are you , a cop or my father?
that's my son .
please help him .
you're all he's got .
he's your son !
this is something you can't run away from .
just like his dad .
sorry , sir .
we're closed .
anybody know where spyder is?
we're closed , mister .
where's spyder?
peace , brother .
peace .
stick the friar tuck act up your ass .
where's spyder?
you know who i am?
yeah
tell spyder i know he killed my partner .
i got proof .
he wants to see me , i'm at the seaway motel .
room 1 05 .
you got that?
yeah .
1 05 .
seaway motel .
here's where we're expecting the storm .
on our map , lots of green .
and within that , yellows and reds .
these are the areas where we're expecting heavy rain .
in new york city , the storm will move in by tomorrow morning .
you got something for me?
dave simon .
lt. lamarca .
got it .
i want backup and emergency units to ocean and neptune .
lt. katt?
don't fucking move !
don't move a finger .
give me the gun .
give me the fucking gun !
go ahead .
move !
what the fuck is this?
what are you doing telling people i shot that cop?
i know you killed my partner , scumbag .
it was your junkie kid .
i'm not the only one that thinks so .
you left a footprint in his blood .
are those justin , size 1 0?
you're a long way from manhattan .
but too close to home for you .
you broke into my property .
i'm within my rights to defend it .
i couldn't take the chance he'd hurt gina or angelo .
would be just like him .
you broke in here pretty good .
you learn that in cop school?
so , what now , joey?
hold back and hold your fire !
hold your fire !
keep eyes on that door and those windows !
block that road !
i don't want one tv van !
right up there .
okay , enough .
give me the gun .
it'll be hard enough getting you out alive without them seeing that .
this is no game , son .
please .
you saved my life but they didn't see it .
they don't care .
i ain't going to jail .
i understand .
i wanna help you , just ....
just give me the gun .
lt. lamarca , signal your location !
all right , talk .
talk?
what are you now , fucking oprah?
you got a son and a woman that loves you .
don't run away from that .
you did .
yeah .
i did .
and i'm sorry .
i've regretted it ever since .
we all gotta pay one way or another , right?
what's going on?
it's called " suicide by cop .
quick and easy .
no pills .
no fucking around .
i thought i'd try it .
how did we get this way?
i remember the day you were born .
well , i remember the day you left .
so we're even .
i'm not gonna kill you , son .
well ....
your friends out there will .
you know it .
there he is !
you two !
hold back !
hold your fire !
get the building secure .
give me the gun .
i don't want to shoot you .
you do .
you think i deserve it .
get back !
but you won't .
it's not the real you .
you don't know anything about me .
i do .
you're my kid .
you're not a bad kid .
you're a scared kid whose old man left him .
you didn't get a choice and it hurt .
i know .
but you're my son .
you always will be .
then why did you leave?
i was stupid .
i forgot what it felt like to be alone .
you don't want to do to angelo what i did to you .
what my old man did to me .
you can't .
he don't need a junkie .
you're not a junkie to him .
my old man wasn't a killer to me .
when my old man left , i hated him all my life for what he did to me .
but all i wanted was for him to walk in the door because i missed him .
i didn't want to be alone anymore .
we all pay a price for what we do , but when's enough?
because i paid .
and you paid .
and what?
now angelo has to pay?
you can't !
we got a second chance here , me and you .
i let you think you didn't matter to me .
but i swear i won't run away again .
i'll stay with you , i promise .
you just need to choose it .
know how many people would love a second chance?
help me .
dad , are you okay?
it's just my shoulder .
i didn't do it .
i know .
get rid of the guns !
empty your pockets .
don't give them an excuse .
they'll kill me .
it's okay .
i'm with you now .
ldentify yourself !
it's okay .
it's okay , there are no guns !
raise your hands .
see the hands?
no guns .
get down , drop the gun !
show us your hands !
they're down .
move away !
move away from him !
told you to move away !
take it easy .
all right , take it easy on him !
listen !
anything happens to him , you'll answer to me .
easy with him !
it'll be all right .
it's okay , son .
it's okay .
here he comes .
this way .
watch your head .
i love you .
i want to go on the rocks .
yeah , those are the rocks .
that's the jetty .
let's go on the rocks .
yeah , those are the rocks .
look , see that?
you see that , the airplane?
see?
where do you think that's going?
flying ....
you want to fly away with your dad sometime?
yeah?
because he wants to go with you .
he told me so .
he told me he wants to take you to key west .
you wanna go?
yeah?
good .
when he comes back , you'll go with him to key west .
me , you and him .
grandpa , daddy and you .
we're gonna go to key west .
okay?
yeah .
okay , sweetheart .
you want to put the water in the thing?
go put the water in the thing .
