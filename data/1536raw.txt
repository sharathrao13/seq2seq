east hill bus .
all right , lady , on or off , please .
oh , yes .
that's all .
next bus !
fares , please .
beverly crescent?
who?
beverly crescent .
get off next stop , take number 19 .
fares , please .
i'm sorry , conductor .
would you mind stopping?
leaving us already?
it's in the opposite direction .
that's about the only place we don't go , lady .
fares , please .
why , mrs. miniver .
you know , i ...
don't tell me it's gone .
just a minute .
oh , i was so afraid you'd sold it .
no .
we knew you'd come back .
i know it's foolish and extravagant ... ... but i've simply got to have it .
yes , pack it up quickly , don't give me time to think .
oh , careful , careful .
why , vicar .
this is nice .
for me .
let me put those on the rack .
thank you .
oh , no , not this one .
i might leave it behind , and it's rather precious .
yes , i know the feeling .
guess what this is .
port .
worse than that .
cigars .
well , why not?
my husband does .
he can afford it .
i'm not so sure .
he has a very extravagant wife .
nonsense .
it's quite true .
i can't help it .
i'm afraid i do like nice things .
things far beyond my means sometimes .
oh , pretty clothes ... ... and good schools for the children , the car , the garden , you know .
yes , i know .
does it give you a lovely guilty feeling?
lovely .
oh , vicar !
fellow sinners .
what will the village say?
oh , i think the village knows you're a very understanding person .
that's why you do so much good .
well , i hope i do .
i hope i can when they need me .
you mean , you think there is trouble coming?
i think it's here .
good evening , lady beldon .
good evening , vicar .
good evening .
oh , shopping's impossible nowadays .
you can't get near the counter ... ... and when you do , they haven't got it and you pay twice as much for it .
what a wonderful description .
sit down , simpson .
and don't sniff !
i spent the whole afternoon being pushed around by middle class females ... ... buying things they can't afford .
oh , dear , that means me .
oh , no , much worse .
you're mrs. mannering , aren't you?
miniver .
oh , yes .
the lawyer's wife .
no , my husband's an architect .
i knew he was something of that sort .
i don't know what the country's coming to .
everyone trying to be better than their betters .
no wonder germany's arming .
good evening , your ladyship .
good evening , ballard .
good evening , ma'am .
good evening , mr. ballard .
dear , this bag .
vicar , do go on , please .
well , goodbye , then .
goodbye .
thank you .
i was looking for you on the 5 : 00 .
i missed it by two minutes .
isn't that shameful?
well , time and tide waits for no man .
and trains neither .
are you too late , ma'am , to spare me a moment?
i got something to show you .
well , i ...
it's something very special .
well , of course , mr. ballard .
do show me .
this way , ma'am .
thank you .
oh , mr. ballard .
it's my masterpiece .
how lovely .
you like it , ma'am?
i think it's the most beautiful rose i've ever seen .
the shape .
and the scent .
divine .
and the color ...
i adore red roses .
'tis said , as cupid danced among the gods , he down the nectar flung ... ... which on the white rose being shed , made it forever after red .
wherever did you find that?
hutter's seed catalog , ma'am .
it's pretty , but it ain't true .
what goes to make a rose , ma'am , is breeding ... ... and budding and horse manure , if you'll pardon the expression .
and that's where you come in , ma'am .
i?
i gotta have a name for it .
oh , you want me to name it for you .
no , ma'am , i got a name for it ... ... if you'll give me your permission .
why , of course .
but i don't see ...
i want to call it the " mrs. miniver .
if you'll pardon me , ma'am ... ... i've watched you go in and out of town for years now ... ... and you've always had time to stop and have a word with me ... ... and i've always waited for you to come home ... ... and you remind me of the flower .
and i figured it'd be a very good name for my rose .
it's a lovely compliment , mr. ballard .
i'd be very happy indeed to have you name your rose after me .
well ...
i really must go now .
i'm terribly late already .
goodbye , mr. ballard ... ... and thank you .
thank you very much .
no , no , no , thank you .
i think it's lovely having flowers named after you .
goodbye .
bye .
thank you !
that's my wife .
good as new?
well , almost , sir .
it's a nice car , but afraid it's a little more than i can afford .
oh , i'm sorry , sir .
we have some nice cars in a cheaper bracket .
but i like this one .
well , i'm going to take it .
perhaps you'd better think it over .
no , i'm going to take it .
will you bring it tonight?
very good , sir .
and don't let my wife know how much it cost .
hello , judy !
daddy !
good evening .
mr. miniver , you're just in time to hear judy play her piece .
but i'm afraid ...
it'd encourage her so much .
encourage both of us , in fact .
i'm a little late .
next time .
see you later , judy .
bye , daddy .
what's the hurry , toby?
i can't stop , daddy .
napoleon wants to throw up .
oh , does he?
i wouldn't dare tell you the price , though .
i feel terribly guilty about it .
i was already on my way home and something seemed to come over me ... ... a sort of trance .
i got off the bus ...
hello , darling .
oh , clem .
how are you?
that's clem , dear .
as i was saying , i got off the bus ... ... and i suddenly remembered that vin was due down from oxford tomorrow .
yes , vin , dear , tomorrow .
isn't that exciting?
and so we're all going down to the station to see him .
isn't that wonderful?
sophie , you idiot , clem was standing right here beside me .
of course i haven't told him .
you don't just throw things like that at a man .
well , there wasn't any connection , i just had to say something .
well , i'll probably tell him after dinner tonight .
he's usually most docile when having his coffee .
may we go to the station and meet vin tomorrow?
of course , darling , if you're good .
is vin still a vege ...?
vegetenarian , " mother?
i doubt it , darling .
he'll have some new idea .
that was just a phase he was going through .
what's a phase?
oh , it's just a thing people go through .
do i go through it?
yes , you're going through one now .
am i?
i'm going through a phase !
i'm going through a phase !
stop waving your arms and finish supper .
what phase will he be going through?
we'll have to wait and see .
darling , i mustn't keep daddy waiting .
good night , sweetheart .
be a good girl .
could i run down to the post , ma'am?
cook says she'll clear .
well , of course , gladys , but don't let horace keep you out too late .
rather a dashing fellow , young horace perkins , eh , gladys?
sir !
you know , kay , i ...
you know , clem , i ...
i'm sorry .
go ahead , dear .
no , what were you going to say?
nothing important .
i just wondered if you had a nice time in town , that was all .
oh , wonderful .
i shopped and shopped .
just little things , you know .
oh , i had a puncture in the car today .
oh , no , what a shame .
tires are getting pretty worn on that old bus .
clem , you know what i think?
what?
i think you ought to buy yourself a new tire .
a new tire?
yes , it might not be a bad idea , at that .
they aren't so frightfully expensive , are they?
oh , i guess we can swing it all right .
a new tire shouldn't cost more ... ... than a new hat , should it?
a hat?
well , i just said hat .
i might have said shoes or trousers or anything .
some more coffee , dear?
i have some , thank you , darling .
yeah .
that old bus .
pretty sad .
been giving a lot of trouble lately .
has it?
i hadn't noticed it .
that's the danger with an old car .
you don't notice anything , then when you're doing 70 miles ...
not with our car , dear .
and that's another thing .
it's too slow .
that car is dangerously slow .
clem , what have you been up to?
come on .
get your coat and hat on .
i've got something to show you .
smooth , isn't she?
you all right , darling?
yes .
i was afraid you'd think i'd been a bit too extravagant .
oh , all of us are extravagant now and then , don't you think?
of course .
it's fun .
what's the use of having a little money ... ... if once in a while you can't be reckless with it on something you really want .
where are you going?
after all , what is money?
it's the power to buy ourselves something that'll make us happier .
you shouldn't be a slave to it , though .
say , what are you doing , anyway?
what on earth is that?
do you like it?
do you?
i bought it today .
isn't it lovely?
not bad .
i do think it does something for me , don't you?
yes , it makes you look rather ridiculous .
clem .
maybe it's this gown .
doesn't quite go with it .
yes , but just look at the hat itself .
and if i've had my hair done ... ... it'd look different .
yeah , it would be a difference .
yes , it's very pretty .
good !
then i think it was worth the money .
much?
not for people with a car like ours .
you're pretty clever , aren't you?
i hope you think so , darling .
kay , sit down here a minute .
let me look at you .
you're really quite beautiful , aren't you?
lf you think so , darling .
i think you're even more beautiful than when i married you .
could that be?
i don't see why not .
i've had more reason to be .
put that silly thing away and get into bed , now .
come on , don't stand looking at it all night .
in you go , there .
it's been a lovely day , hasn't it?
yes .
clem , i think we're very lucky people .
because we've got a new car and a new hat?
oh , much more than that .
because of vin and toby and judy ... ... and each other .
yeah .
clem .
guess what .
i had a rose named after me today .
you left the light on in the dressing room tonight .
good night , clem .
good night , dear .
there he is !
there he is !
hello , mother !
hello , vin !
vin , darling !
hello , dad !
fine to have you back .
judy !
hello , toby !
toby !
vin !
vin's got a pipe !
what of it , young fellow?
heavens , you've grown !
only about half an inch , mother .
i've grown a yard !
have you , toby?
where's the mustache , son?
you used to be so proud of it .
i don't remember being so very proud .
i liked it .
sorry .
i found it took up too much of my time .
oh , it did?
keeping it trim and all that .
after all , one can't waste too much time over the vanities of life .
i see .
well , come along , children .
we better get along .
let's go .
here we go .
oh , good heavens .
so your interest doesn't center on cars anymore , vin?
well , this last year at oxford , i've rather changed my outlook on things .
you don't say .
yes .
i think i've grown a little .
matured in my conception as to what life's about .
do you know what oxford taught me?
what , dear?
that i know nothing about anything .
rather a waste of time and money .
not at all , because it's shown me just what i want out of life .
and what's that , vin?
to learn .
i want to encompass all the knowledge i can in my brief span .
what's " span , " vin?
it's a bridge .
a bridge?
scientific knowledge , philosophical , sociological .
and when i realize the infinitesimal part of this i possess , it makes me shudder .
and apart from all that , mother , i think i've developed a social consciousness .
what's that , vin?
it's the recognition of my fellow man .
where are there free men today ... ... any more than in the 9th to the 15th centuries?
front door , gladys .
look , the 9th to 15th centuries , when the lords held all the land ... ... and parceled out what they wished to their vassals .
look about .
what have we?
as pure a feudalistic state as there ever was in the 9th through 15th centuries .
when i think about it , i'm appalled , genuinely appalled .
i tell you , father ... when i think of the class system that exists in this country to ...
what is it , gladys?
oh , it's miss beldon to see you , ma'am .
well , show her in , gladys .
miss beldon .
i wonder what that means .
probably brought the latest ultimatum from her illustrious grandmother .
i scarcely know lady beldon .
the perfect example of what i've been saying .
lady beldon is the living proof of the survival of the feudal system today .
you can't escape the beldon influence .
it contaminates the entire village society .
just as in the 9th to the 15th centuries .
exactly .
how do you do , mrs. miniver?
i'm carol beldon .
how do you do , miss beldon?
this is my husband .
how do you do?
and my son vincent .
how do you do?
just in time for tea , miss beldon .
thanks , but i've just had some .
sit down anyway .
i can only stay a moment .
please , do sit down .
you really must excuse me for invading your house like this ... ... but frankly , i've come to make a request .
a personal request , and a great favor .
well , please , sit down .
thank you .
you see , my grandmother doesn't know i've come .
i'm afraid i'm not very good at breaking things gently ... ... so i'll get straight to the point .
it's about the rose .
the rose?
yes .
the one mr. ballard grew .
the mrs. miniver .
i hear he's going to enter it in the flower show .
for the beldon challenge cup?
yes .
but no one ever has entered ...
that is ...
no ... ... no one has ever entered a rose in competition with my grandmother .
and that's just the point .
it's become a tradition for her to win the cup ... ... and her roses mean so much to her .
i know it seems an awful thing to ask ... ... but i thought you might , perhaps , as a favor ... ... persuade mr. ballard to withdraw his rose from the competition .
to be frank , it's such a beautiful rose it might easily win , and , well ...
miss beldon ... ... may i ask whether this is an open competition?
yes , technically ...
technically , yes , but actually , no .
yes , i suppose that's it .
you see ...
i see only too well , miss beldon .
because mr. ballard is not of the ruling class ... ... is a mere vassal , as it were ...
vin , please .
let miss beldon explain .
but , mother , miss beldon doesn't have to explain , not to me .
i'm aware of the influence of the feudal system in this village .
these are orders from the manor .
her ladyship must have no competition .
you must excuse my son .
he's just down from oxford .
don't apologize for me .
i mean everything i say .
well , i'm glad to hear it , but do you do anything about it?
do?
why , what do you mean?
if you feel something is wrong , what are you doing about it?
i've spent holidays the last few years doing settlement work in london slums .
you wallow in luxury all the year ...
i don't wallow ! ... and think a few weeks playing lady bountiful ...
come , vin .
it's not much , perhaps ... ... but it's the only thing i know .
what have you been doing?
i?
well ...
i see .
just talk .
that's all right .
it's easier .
listen , i didn't say ...
oh , don't apologize .
i know how comfortable it is to curl up with a book full of big words ... ... and think you're going to solve the problems of the universe .
but you're not .
a bit of action is required now and then .
action?
if that's what you and your class are asking for ... ... maybe you'll get it one of these days .
maybe .
but not from the talkers .
vin !
remember , miss beldon is a guest .
if you have any manners at all ...
manners?
a humble working man is denied the reward of his artistry ... ... to gratify the vanity of an aristocrat ...
quiet .
this isn't your concern .
i beg to differ .
i'm concerned for a fellow man's dignity .
and the indignity that's heaped upon him .
you'll excuse me , i'm sure , miss beldon .
certainly .
i must apologize for vin .
oh , no , please , it's all right .
and besides , he's rather nice , isn't he?
what?
well ...
really , you know , he's perfectly right .
i have not a leg to stand on in this business .
i shouldn't have asked you .
i realized that before the words were out of my mouth .
it's just that my grandmother's over 80 and takes such pride ... ... in winning year after year .
of course .
but please forget i said anything about it .
anyhow , i'm glad we met at last .
i hope we see more of each other .
i hope so too .
you'll be at the sailing club dance?
oh , yes .
good .
i'll see you there , then .
goodbye .
to hear people , you'd think mr. ballard committed a crime .
i don't hold with people getting ideas above their station .
who's he to think he can enter his rose in the show?
and who's to say he can't?
nobody's ever entered a rose ... ... against lady beldon since she started 30 years ago .
keep a civil tongue ... ... or i'll be doing my shopping in meekham after this !
my opinion has got nothing to do with the quality of my merchandise .
if you'd called your rose a " lady beldon , " i'd have said right and proper .
but who's mrs. miniver?
the nicest lady in the neighborhood ... ... mr. huggins , that's who .
yeah , maybe , but a newcomer .
no , mr. ballard , you stick to the railway and leave roses alone .
why should i?
why should i?
they're my hobby , the roses are .
and the railway can go to ...
doesn't she look lovely?
and a sense of humor too .
i loved the way she handled vin this afternoon .
i think she's coming over .
hello .
good evening , miss beldon .
please , sit down .
sit down , won't you?
thank you .
enjoying it?
yes , such a wonderful band .
how about a cordial?
no , thanks .
cigarette?
no , thanks .
i was rather looking for your son .
i'm sorry , vin's not here .
no , he's suffering from an acute case of maturity .
yes .
but it'll pass .
we give it a week or two , at the outside .
i wanted to tell him i was sorry about this afternoon .
i rather think he wanted to say the same thing himself .
it's a pity ...
i beg your pardon .
for you , miss beldon .
thank you .
may i?
of course .
secret?
well , i suppose it is .
do i scent romance?
well , it is intriguing .
will you excuse me?
please don't get up .
i'll see you later .
is it that big navy lad from dartmouth?
you'd be surprised .
hello .
hello .
you got my note?
as you see .
yes , of course .
miss beldon , i don't want you to think i'm going back on anything i said .
of course not .
but i did express myself a bit emphatically .
i hope you'll excuse me .
my mode of expression , i mean .
there's really nothing to excuse .
everyone's entitled to his mode of expression .
still , i had no right to lose my temper .
i'm usually quite detached .
i was pretty snippy myself , wasn't i?
and quite in the wrong , anyway .
i'm sorry .
it's nice of you to say so .
well ...
i'd better be getting back .
i promised this tango .
oh , you couldn't .
well , i mean , just for a moment .
you see , i've got so much i want to say , to explain about myself .
of course , you want to dance .
you don't dance?
oh , yes .
yes , i do .
matter of fact , i'm considered a pretty good dancer .
but i've rather given up that sort of thing .
well ...
i mean , frankly ... ... is this a time for frivolity?
is this a time to lose one's sense of humor?
did you say give him a week or two?
maybe an hour or two will be enough .
and i used to see you go by ... ... and you used to ride in a little tub cart , then you had a pony .
oh , yes .
he was a dear .
he was very , very fat , and so were you .
i was not fat .
you were , very fat .
why , you had legs like overstuffed sausages .
you see , i've really known you for years and years .
i used to think about you a lot .
well , don't you believe me?
well , you know , you are a good talker .
i wish i were .
i'd like to tell you just how i feel .
you've told me a lot for one day .
one day .
why , one day's ridiculous .
what's one day out of all the vast ...?
do you have any conception ...?
can't we arrange to meet again sometime soon?
tomorrow .
tomorrow i'm leaving for scotland .
for long?
until the middle of september .
we always go , every year .
but that's months .
may i write to you?
yes , vin .
this has been a wonderful evening , hasn't it?
yes , vin .
it's been a wonderful evening , hasn't it?
have i said that before?
it's been a wonderful evening .
for you too?
for me too , vin .
well , looks as though we've had all that quarreling for nothing .
don't look as if there'll be a flower show after all .
what makes you say that?
her ladyship's talking of postponing the show on account of conditions .
very right and proper .
they've marched into poland , haven't they?
that means war , if you ask me .
and if war comes ... ... it's " goodbye , roses .
don't talk silly .
you might as well say , " goodbye , england .
there will always be roses .
she's come back .
she wasn't to have returned for another week .
dearly beloved brethren , the scripture moveth us in sundry places ... ... to acknowledge and confess our manifold sins and wickedness .
and not dissemble nor cloak them before almighty god , our heavenly father .
but confess them with a humble , lowly ...
will everyone please be seated .
it has just been announced over the air by the prime minister ... ... that our country is at war .
in the circumstances ... ... i don't think you'll wish me to continue ... ... as you will probably , most of you , have some other duty to perform .
that the prayer for peace still lives in our hearts ... ... coupled now with the prayer for our beloved country .
we in this village ... ... have not failed in the past .
our forefathers , for 1000 years , have fought for the freedom we now enjoy .
and that we must now defend again .
with god's help ... ... and their example ... ... we cannot ... ... and shall not fail .
are we going to be bombed , daddy?
toby , don't shout , darling .
are we going to be bombed?
come on .
carol .
i'll be right along , granny .
beg your pardon .
carol !
hello .
you came back early .
oh , i'm so glad .
how are you fixed , in case of anything?
quite all right , i think .
i must go , vin .
goodbye .
yes?
ma'am , i'm so glad you've come .
gladys is carrying on ...
pardon me .
carrying on something awful .
i've had her on me hands all morning .
what's the matter?
it's on account of horace .
called up and asked to join his regiment tonight .
yes , ma'am , and gladys in floods of tears .
and that stove ... ... the man only come friday to look at it , and what he done , i don't know .
but she's not fit to work .
she's not , really .
well , never mind , ada .
i daresay we'll manage somehow .
napoleon !
toby , take him away .
i suppose they broadcast the news .
yes , ma'am , what a dreadful thing .
and that laundry .
lost another of me best aprons .
but we've always got the navy .
that's right , ada .
oh , come on , now .
cheer up , gladys .
horace won't be anywhere near the frontline .
oh , yes , he will .
he's one to push himself forward .
he says , " you let me get me hands on hitler .
i'll give him sweatsticker .
give him what?
sweatsticker .
you know , sir , the sign they have on their flags .
well , that's the proper spirit , gladys .
he's got too much spirit .
he gives way to it .
i beg pardon , but would you tell gladys horace has got to catch his train ... ... and could he come in a minute and say goodbye?
oh , of course he can .
come in , horace .
thank you , sir .
morning , everybody .
good morning , horace .
will you have a sherry?
don't mind if i do .
and jolly good luck to you , horace .
yes , indeed .
jolly good luck , horace .
thanks , master toby .
to your very good health .
my best respects , ma'am .
the children are going to miss you terribly .
and poor gladys .
oh , she'll be all right , won't you , glad?
here , here .
that's not the way to behave .
how do you expect me to behave when you go off and get killed?
well , cheer up .
i ain't killed yet .
here , have a drop of this .
you don't mind , sir?
oh , certainly not .
there .
that's better .
have one for yourself now .
you'll want gladys to see you to the station , won't you?
go get your hat .
very nice drop of stuff , this .
last i shall get for a bit , i expect .
make a lot of difference to a lot of people , this war will .
yes , a lot of difference .
we may all meet on the frontline yet .
not me , horace .
the raf for me .
oh , boy !
i've always been keen on flying .
that's all right too .
well , i got to get to me train .
i'll say goodbye , ma'am .
yes , of course , horace .
goodbye , and the best of luck .
goodbye , horace .
let us know how it's going .
i will .
you'll excuse the spelling .
i'm better with a bayonet than with a pencil .
you can write it in blood .
nice child you have .
keep your chin up .
thank you .
hello !
well , she's done you proud , horace .
not half , she ain't .
full dress inspection kit .
and very nice too , gladys .
thank you , ma'am .
say goodbye to napoleon .
goodbye , all .
and cat .
and many thanks , i'm sure .
goodbye , horace .
bye , horace .
mind if i get on with the blackout?
all right , dear .
thought i'd run up to the beldon place later on .
two women alone , you know , might be a good idea to look things over .
yes , i think you should , dear .
one ought to be neighborly .
oh , yes , indeed one should .
may i go with him , mother?
lf he'll have you .
no !
isn't he very young , even for the air force?
yes , he's young .
may i see miss carol?
is she expecting you , sir?
no , but i think she would see me .
vin !
hello , carol .
it's all right , chandler .
it's nice of you to come .
well , i wanted to find out if everything's all right .
do come in .
everything's fine .
after a terrific row with mr. foley ... ... my grandmother's agreed to obey the blackout regulations .
i was worried about you .
that's sweet of you , vin .
it was sweet to write me letters while i was in scotland .
so you did get them .
yes , of course .
i wondered if you did when you didn't answer .
vin , i didn't know how to answer .
you're such a crazy boy ... ... and i didn't think the craze would last .
craze?
well , it is rather sudden , isn't it?
this is only the third time we've met .
does that matter?
no , but i'd like to be sure .
i don't really know you very well , do i?
we could do something about that .
we could see a lot of each other .
every day while i'm around .
would that be all right?
why , yes .
why not?
gosh , i'm glad to see you again .
i'm glad too , vin .
i say , is it an awful nerve?
well , i mean , we have a sort of agreement , haven't we?
would it be going too far?
it's all right , vin .
i heard voices .
may i ask whom you're entertaining?
this is vincent miniver .
my grandmother .
how do you do , lady beldon?
miniver?
miniver .
i know that name .
a rose with that name has been entered in the show .
the miniver rose .
that's something new .
the marshall neil , the flower called drushke ... ... the duchess of argyle and now the mrs. miniver .
please , granny .
a tramp rose grown in a station yard .
it's nothing to do with vin .
then what's he doing here , if one may ask?
i came to offer my services .
i see .
you're in league with wretched foley .
oh , no , lady beldon .
oh , granny .
never heard such rot .
we can take care of ourselves .
we have for the last 800 years .
but ...
we don't take orders , we give them .
worst thing about this war is the chance ... ... it gives little persons to become important .
air raids , indeed .
those wretched germans .
they wouldn't dare ...
what should we do?
do?
nothing .
it's foley giving a false alarm .
you can't take that attitude .
i beg your pardon , young man !
you must take precautions .
ring for the butler and gather the servants in the cellar .
then go down there yourself .
i must call my parents .
the telephone?
in the hall .
upon my word !
sirens , milady .
i'm not deaf .
get all the servants quickly to the cellar .
you too , granny .
he said so .
the cellar !
hello?
that you , dad?
all right with you?
yes , everything under control .
right .
i'll expect you when i see you , then .
who is it?
air raid warden .
hello , foley .
what's up?
you're showing a light .
we are?
bright horizontal beam plainly visible from the air .
every window in the house is ...
ground level .
oh , gosh .
this way , foley .
thank you .
good evening , mrs. miniver .
good evening , mr. foley .
yes .
how about this blanket , mr. foley?
i think i can use it , all right .
there .
that fixes that .
it's those tiny cracks that do the damage .
one man lighting a cigarette ... ... stands out like a beacon from 5000 feet up .
one little crack of light might lead the whole german air force straight here .
well , it was lucky it was just you .
yes , indeed .
strictly speaking , you're liable to a fine ... ... but as senior warden , you'll hear no more about it .
that's awfully nice .
you got a nice place here for storage .
hear the minister of food the other day ... ... recommended stocking up a bit?
you want to put in some tin foods in case of emergency .
sugar , now , sure to go out .
i've got some wonderful demerara .
will 50 pounds be enough?
well , really , i ...
make it 20 pounds , best demerara .
bismarck herring?
i hate them .
kipper snacks?
salmon?
sardines?
i've got lovely italian sardines .
might not be able to get them later .
you never know what mussolini will do .
there you are .
all clear .
they didn't get further than the coast .
is the war over , mommy?
no , darling .
this is just the first day .
oh , good .
oh , come on .
attention , england .
this is your english friend in germany again .
now , listen carefully while there's yet time .
time to avoid further useless bloodshed .
it's now eight months since your government declared war ... ... eight months of progressive disaster for the enemies of the german reich .
france has been defeated as i told you she would be , if you remember ... ... and her invincible armies completely crushed .
i need hardly tell you that england comes next on the list .
already the boasted british coolness has given place to blind panic .
already there have been serious riots in your key industries ... ... and they didn 't tell you that , did they?
already the british lion is howling with terror .
turn it off , george .
had enough?
he's all wind and whitewash , like a blinking rook .
can't we get some news?
not till 9 .
you work at the airfield .
you see that german plane come down?
i heard it .
i wonder where the pilot is .
with all that cover in them woods , he could lay there for days .
but he's got to get food , don't forget .
be funny if he walked in here , wouldn't it?
he'd never do that .
i don't know so much .
they're clever .
some goes to oxford and learns to speak english ... ... just as good as what you and me do .
well , almost .
did you get that fritz?
not yet .
we will .
whiskey .
what are you having?
i'll have a beer , sir .
pretty smart , these jerries .
this chap was an ace too .
got six of our fellows .
cheerio !
vin !
hello , dad .
where did you spring from?
belham airfield .
you're practically on the doorstep .
isn't it grand?
i was buzzing home when i saw you .
this is good news .
you don't know the half of it .
see that?
pilot officer miniver .
so soon?
i thought ...
things are moving pretty fast .
they cut short the course .
i got 85 % on the test and a week's leave on the strength of it .
great stuff .
congratulations .
that calls for a drink .
what'll you have?
i don't think i will .
i phoned mother i was coming .
i called carol too .
i'll bet you did .
i'll run up there later on .
how much do i owe you , george?
five and sixpence .
there you are .
keep the change .
thank you very much .
bye , george .
where is everybody?
kay !
well , what is this?
vin !
mother .
carol .
oh , vin .
vin , darling .
carol , both of you , it's wonderful .
i didn't want to miss a minute .
how are you?
fine .
don't i look it?
he's brown .
open air life , mother .
it's good to see you all again .
i sort of don't know which way to turn !
seen these?
makes a good looking pilot , doesn't he?
vin , already?
two months before my regular time .
and what a bit of luck being transferred to an airfield so near .
a fellow i knew had his people living round about .
when he flew over , he'd cut his engine so they'd know who it was .
well , i suppose now you're ready for real flying .
not only for real flying but real ...
well , whatever they send me into .
fighting .
where are the kids?
upstairs .
you wouldn't let them dine with us?
i might .
i'll run up and tell them .
no .
i'm going .
clem , coming?
yeah .
i've got to change .
hello .
hello .
have you heard we're losing gladys?
is horace on leave?
oh , no , sir .
gladys joined the waafs .
she's off to aldershot .
what's a waaf?
women's auxiliary air force .
it's just a coincidence that horace is stationed at aldershot too .
oh , sir !
you are a marvel .
mother?
yes , darling .
is vin going to marry carol?
now , toby , just finish your dumpling , darling .
i only said , " is vin going to marry carol?
isn't it nice having vin at home and staying down here for dinner?
yes .
are you going to marry carol , vin?
well , since you bring it up , toby , i haven't had the nerve to ask her .
why not?
you're brave , aren't you?
don't be so silly , toby .
gentlemen don't propose when they're eating .
why not?
well , it's not romantic .
of course it isn't .
toby .
what?
why don't you ask me if i'm going to marry vin?
are you?
lf he asks me .
he's afraid .
why , say , i'm not going to stand for that .
carol , i meant to wait for judy's romantic moments and all that ... ... but will you marry me , carol?
soon?
oh , egads .
this is the darnedest proposal i've ...
is it yes , carol?
it's yes , vin .
oh , my dear , i'm so happy .
may i ...?
go ahead , dad .
it's the telephone , ma'am .
he wants to speak to pilot officer vincent miniver .
hello .
yes .
yes , speaking .
why , of course , sir .
oh , i see .
about half an hour .
yes , sir .
immediately , sir .
goodbye .
that was the airfield .
i have to report .
it's a blow , isn't it?
oh , but why?
some job or other .
you don't ask why in the air force .
i'm sorry , mother .
i can't believe it , vin .
they promised you a week .
you know how things are .
good job i hadn't unpacked .
i'll go get my bag .
i promised to be at the airport in half an hour .
i'll get the car and drive you over , vin .
well , it's a disappointment .
no use pretending it isn't .
but now that we've got him so near ...
does that mean that he's going into action?
not necessarily , carol .
well , i better get the car .
it certainly hasn't been much of a leave .
goodbye , mother .
goodbye , darling .
do take care of yourself .
oh , i will .
goodbye , you .
be good .
remember , you're engaged .
better not tell the old lady .
not until i get back .
then we'll go hand in hand and beard the old lion in her own rose garden .
goodbye , judy .
get me some souvenirs .
what do you want?
messerschmitt .
goodbye , toby .
bye , vin .
make me a dive bomber .
all right .
bye .
so long .
shoot down some jerries and fritzes .
i will .
goodbye , and don't worry about me .
85 % on the test , you know .
what a beautiful night .
clear as day .
happy about the engagement , clem?
oh , very .
sweet child , young carol .
isn't she?
wonder how the old lady's going to take it .
she'll be proud .
you couldn't be prejudiced , could you?
certainly not .
vin's a very unusual boy .
yes .
listen , clem .
engine trouble .
no , it's vin .
don't you remember what he told us about signaling?
about the boy who used to signal to his mother?
that was vin .
by job , i believe you're right .
good old vin .
good luck , vin .
hello?
clem !
yes?
who?
oh , emergency .
i see .
what is it , clem?
it's all right , dear .
is it vin?
oh , no .
it's only the river patrol .
all right , old man , i'll come right over .
you're not going out on the river?
i've got to .
i'm on patrol .
i wonder what's up .
2 : 30 .
what on earth can they want?
i can't imagine .
you've been out after that german flyer all day , and i'll not let you go .
now i am confused .
are those orders?
where are you off to?
sandwiches and a thermos .
if you're going on duty , you'll need them .
thank you .
hello , miniver .
hello , halliday .
nobby , what's on?
i don't know .
he's your crew .
how much petrol have you got?
about half full .
why?
what's up?
fill her up , dixon .
hi , mr. miniver .
what's up?
wish i knew .
what do you think?
don't know .
do you know?
all i know is ... ... i've been dragged out of bed to open up the bar .
awfully glad you were .
a couple of points to starboard there .
scots , wae hae wi 'wallace bled .
hello , chaps .
why the glad rags?
well , i was in london at the savoy and i got old halliday's call ... ... and i come straight down .
any idea what we're up to?
who cares?
theirs is not to reason why .
theirs is but to do or die .
gallant 600 .
give me a drink .
miniver , what you make of it?
i'll do anything for our country , but digging us out at 2 in the morning ...
that carries the war too far .
where are we going?
orders are to collect all petrol boats ... ... of 30 feet and over i can lay my hands on ... ... shove crews in , fill them and send them to ramsgate .
ramsgate?
why ramsgate?
i don't know .
your guess is as good as mine .
the sooner we get off the better .
hooray for ramsgate !
sign that for me , will you , joe?
sure thing .
come on , mac .
sign that for me .
what on earth?
there must be close to 1000 .
look .
look , sir .
attention , please .
attention , everyone .
attention , please .
switch off your engines .
as you know , the british expeditionary force ... ... is trapped between the enemy and the sea .
four hundred thousand men are crowded on the beaches ... ... under bombardment from artillery and planes .
their only chance to escape annihilation rests with you .
your destination is dunkirk .
it's my duty to tell you that the effort is not without risk .
you are asked to cross 40 miles of open sea ... ... many of you in small boats that are far from seaworthy .
shore guns and enemy aircraft are going to make it tough for you .
any of you who wish to withdraw may do so now .
very good .
we'll put to sea at once .
smaller boats without compasses will follow ... ... in the wake of larger ships at the head of the line .
every moment counts .
good luck to you .
all right with you?
aye , sir .
turn her over .
good morning , ma'am .
good morning , mr. ballard .
you're up early .
yes .
i haven't been sleeping very well .
listen .
guns .
funny how the sound carries with this east wind .
mr. miniver's not back from dunkirk , i suppose?
no , he's not back .
neither is my son .
they've been gone five days now .
oh , they'll be back , ma'am .
you'll see .
yes .
i'll be very glad to see .
you will .
them that goes down to the sea in ships and has business in the great waters ... ... these men see the works of the lord and his wonders in the great deep .
you can't beat the bible , can you , when it comes to deep feelings?
no .
and no one that's thrown that over ... ... for a set of goebbels and grings is going to win this war .
that's my comfort , ma'am .
mine too , mr. ballard .
there's to be a flower show this year , you know , up at beldon hall .
it takes more than a war to stop her old ladyship .
oh , i am so sorry .
what were you saying?
i was telling you about my rose , ma'am .
i've entered it for the show and i ...
well , i should know better than to be bothering you .
oh , but you're not .
i'm so glad .
it's a beautiful rose .
it deserves a prize .
thank you , ma'am .
well ...
i'll be getting along .
good day , mr. ballard .
move or make noise , i shoot .
alone?
my children are upstairs , and the maid .
all asleep .
food .
drink .
all right .
food , quick .
i'm getting it .
stop pointing that gun at me !
you're frightening me !
milk .
milk .
hurry .
give me .
you got meat?
yes , i think so .
hurry .
i am hurrying .
go back .
it's the milkman .
coat .
give me coat .
wait .
i'll get you the coat .
keep door open .
go .
the police .
urgent , please .
police?
this is mrs. miniver .
miniver .
starlings .
i've got that german flyer , the one who escaped .
in the kitchen .
yes , i'm all right .
will you come to the back door?
he's wounded .
bring a doctor .
thank you .
i took your gun .
you call police?
yes .
it's much better .
let me help you .
there , now .
it's much better this way .
really , it is .
you'll be wonderfully looked after in a hospital .
you'll be safe there .
the war won't last forever .
no .
soon we finish it .
i'm finish ... ... but others come ... ... like me .
thousands , many thousands .
better .
all of this ... ... you will see .
you will see .
we will come .
we will bomb your cities ... ... like barcelona ... ... warsaw ... ... narvik , rotterdam .
rotterdam we destroy in two hours .
and thousands killed .
innocent people .
not innocent !
they were against us !
women and children !
thirty thousand in two hours .
and we will do the same thing here !
it's his arm , doctor .
all right , sir .
come along , young fellow .
thank you , ma'am .
move along now .
you all right , mrs. miniver?
yes , thank you , doctor .
mommy?
who was that , mommy?
who was here , mommy?
who was here?
clem !
it's daddy , darling !
it's daddy !
run and tell judy .
judy !
judy !
clem , darling !
darling , are you all right?
hello , darling .
oh , i'm so glad to see you .
daddy !
daddy !
hello , darling .
daddy !
daddy !
how are you?
you're awful dirty .
and i'm awful tired .
gosh , i'm tired .
come .
you're going straight to bed .
are you sure you're all right?
yes , i'm fine .
just the boat .
come on , children .
go on , toby .
any word of vin?
no , but he'll be back soon .
i'm sure of it .
darling , it's so lovely to have you home .
come on , toby .
i want to sleep for a week .
there , darling .
oh , that's good .
can i get you some breakfast , darling?
it's vin , clem !
it's vin !
he's back .
did i hear you offer me some breakfast?
ten hours ago .
ten hours?
but vin ate it .
vin , home?
home .
both of you .
where is he now?
he went up to beldon hall to break the news of the engagement .
i don't envy him that trip .
serves him right , though , for eating my breakfast .
anything left?
what do you want?
well , i should ...
what have you got?
i'll find out .
ada !
i didn't know when you'd wake up , so i couldn't order anything for dinner .
breakfast .
no matter what time it is when i wake up , it's breakfast .
come in .
hello , ada .
well , i am glad to see you , sir !
after what it said in the papers , i was quite worried about you .
i was .
that's nice of you , but i'm all right .
all i need now is a good large plate of ham and eggs .
all right , sir .
then it is in the papers?
about dunkirk?
yes .
yes , dear .
thank heavens .
i shan't have to tell you about it .
clem , i'm so proud of you .
are you , darling?
well , that's nice .
and come to think of it , i'm a bit proud of myself .
what you might call a real bit of navigation .
i wouldn't have missed it for the world .
oh , darling , i'm almost sorry for you , having a nice , quiet , peaceful time ... ... when things were happening .
but that's what men are for , isn't it?
to do things while women look after the house .
yes , dear .
come in .
i'm sorry , ma'am , but i just remembered we ain't got any ham .
what?
you gave it all to that german pilot .
oh , well , never mind .
we've got some bacon .
mr. miniver likes that just as well .
all right , ma'am .
what's that about a german pilot?
nothing at all .
what do you mean , " nothing at all "?
well , i just had a german pilot in for ham and eggs this morning .
wait !
what's going on here?
now , clem , don't get excited .
i'm going to draw your bath .
i've had a bath .
i'm not excited !
a cigarette?
no , i don't want one .
was it the fellow we were looking for?
yes .
but what did you do?
woman , you're driving me crazy .
didn't he have a gun?
well , yeah , he had a gun .
well?
i took it from him and called the police .
oh , you just took it to the police ...
just like that .
and then i suppose you gave him tea .
milk .
milk .
clem !
come in .
what is it , ada?
it's the old lady , ma'am .
and me with the eggs on the stove .
it's lady beldon .
beldon , here?
no , ma'am .
downstairs .
all right .
tell her i'll be down in a minute .
very well , ma'am .
lady beldon .
if i hadn't known you'd taken that pilot single handed , i'd say you were scared .
i am scared , just as i was when i took that german pilot single handed .
know why she's come in such haste?
to object to the marriage , i suppose .
it's really insufferable snobbery .
a boy like vin , she ought to be proud and happy .
and honored .
i wish i had a better dress on .
oh , well .
clement miniver , don't you dare smile .
why , lady beldon , this is nice .
won't you sit down here?
i think i can guess why you came .
vin's told you his news , hasn't he?
yes , mrs. miniver .
i do hope you're as pleased as we are .
i'm afraid not .
why , they're infants .
carol's 18 and that boy's not 20 .
yes , they are young .
i hope to persuade carol to wait .
you think she may change her mind?
frankly , yes .
perhaps make a better match .
there's always that possibility .
of course , it may be just maternal vanity ... ... but i don't think carol will find anyone nicer than vin .
i don't believe she'll change her mind .
it's a matter of opinion .
her age is a matter of fact .
isn't that beldon tradition ... ... to marry young?
i don't know what you mean .
my daughter judy ...
you've not met judy .
she had to write a composition on the crusades .
she brought a small book home from the library ... ... called a friend of king richard the lion hearted .
it was a life of an ancestor of yours .
really , i fail to see ...
it was a fascinating book .
i got quite interested in it myself .
it was full of stories of the beldon family .
i trust you satisfied yourself we were worthy of the alliance .
well , there were one or two things that rather surprised me .
did you know that the 12th lord beldon was hanged?
he was beheaded .
such things happen in the best families .
usually in the best families .
in fact , what interested me most ... ... was the extreme youth of the beldon brides .
this gilbert beldon ... ... who went on the crusades , married an isabelle du something or other , age 12 .
i did not come here to chatter pedigrees .
i'm old fashioned .
i believe in breeding .
that's neither here nor there .
your point is , they're too young .
i've said so , haven't i?
we're at war , lady beldon .
and vin's a flyer .
it's no excuse for rushing into an ill considered marriage .
but in war , time is so precious to the young people .
how old were you when you married?
i?
it's no use telling fibs ... ... because i looked you up .
oh , well , if you've looked me up ... ... i suppose you know that i was 16 .
sixteen .
and did your parents approve?
that's beside the point .
oh , forgive me .
is it?
you married very young , without your parents 'consent ... ... and yet when carol ...
oh , but perhaps you regretted it .
i did nothing of the kind .
then why ...?
my marriage lasted a few weeks .
my husband was in the army .
he was killed in action .
oh , i'm so sorry .
forgive me .
i didn't know .
i never regretted it .
not for one moment .
we married because we knew that might happen .
but i don't want carol to suffer as i suffered .
don't you want her to be happy , even for a little while ... ... the way you were?
i was afraid you'd say that .
not that it matters what you say .
or what i say , either .
you know that , don't you?
you mean , carol will go her own way?
she's my granddaughter .
well , then why?
goodness knows .
i was beaten before i started .
you don't mind terribly , do you?
he is a nice boy .
yes .
i see now where he gets it .
you're pretty too .
no wonder that wretched ballard named his rose after you .
not that he's got a chance of getting the cup from me .
well , so long as we're going to be relatives ... ... the least you can do is to offer me some tea .
well?
oh , yes .
yes , of course .
so alice sat on with closed eyes ... ... and half believed herself again in wonderland .
with the grass rustling in the wind ... ... and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds ... ... the tinkling sheep bells , the voice of the shepherd boy ... ... and the lowing of the cattle in the distance .
she pictured to herself how she would keep through all her riper years ... ... the simple and loving heart of her childhood ... ... and how she would gather about her other little children ... ... and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale .
perhaps even with a dream of wonderland .
they're asleep .
good .
what time is it , darling?
ten to 10 .
going to have your coffee now?
no .
i think i'll have a little smoke first .
anything you want from the house?
no , i don't think so .
i'm not going to risk my life for your knitting needles again .
no .
i've got them with me .
fine barrage tonight , isn't it?
it gets better each time .
i can't hear any bombs , can you?
no .
i suppose they're saving them for the aerodrome again .
yes .
and the county hospital .
well .
my laundry come back?
tomorrow .
tomorrow .
oh , no , you don't .
you ought to patent that , clem .
it saves us from suffocating .
see this new idea?
no .
what is it?
the latest in gas detectors .
if there's any gas , the gauze turns green .
does it stop the gas from coming in?
if you see this gauze change color ... ... grab this , shut it with a bang like that , see?
then what happens?
then we suffocate .
biscuit?
thank you .
mrs. miniver's best .
ada wasn't much good at coffee .
she was awful .
still , she was a good cook , as good cooks go .
and as good cooks go , she went .
still , ada will be a tower of strength in the tank corps canteen .
closer .
i wonder what toby would do if he lost that cat .
i daren't think .
i suppose that's the way to be really happy .
be with something that you just can't live without .
or someone .
isn't that getting a little long?
vin says they like them long in the air force .
isn't it nice they're getting back for the flower show?
yes , isn't it?
find out when their train arrives?
11 : 45 , i think they said .
good .
i am glad they went to scotland for the honeymoon .
it's so beautiful .
yeah .
that's a bomb .
they are going for the aerodrome again .
have you finished with this , darling?
yes .
it's a lovely story .
i wonder if lewis carroll ever dreamed it would live forever .
you know , it's the first story i read .
mine too .
really?
how she would keep through all her riper years ... ... the simple and loving heart of her childhood ...
... and how she would gather about her little children ... ... and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale .
perhaps even with the dream of wonderland of long ago .
and how she would feel with all her simple sorrows ... ... and find a pleasure in all her simple joys ... ... remembering her own child life and the happy summer days .
the happy summer days .
napoleon's all right , darling .
he's gone under there .
mommy?
yes , dear?
they nearly killed us this time , didn't they?
it's all over , darling .
it's all over now .
hello , mother .
hello , dad .
hello , darling .
how have you been?
we had a wonderful time .
good looking bride you've got , boy .
hello , mother !
oh , my god .
good to see you again .
wonderful .
carol , sweet .
don't i get a kiss?
certainly do .
did you enjoy yourselves?
we had a lovely time .
we fished and rowed and sailed .
we had a lovely little cottage and a mrs. mclorry to cook for us .
how she cooked , and how we ate .
can i help you , dad?
no .
hello , mr. ballard .
how do you do?
morning , ballard .
i see you've entered your rose in the flower show .
it's a good rose .
i haven't seen it yet .
i wager the best thing about it is its name .
the mrs. miniver .
that's you , my dear .
you're coming to the flower show?
all except clem .
i'm afraid i can't .
i'm on patrol duty .
you're missing a lot .
local talent .
old snope is playing his flute solo .
i'll be there early .
all right .
goodbye , dear .
careful .
how's it going , george?
fine , mr. miniver .
just fine .
let's go , vin .
well , here we are .
welcome home , such as it is .
it's quite a mess .
it must've been dreadful .
oh , it's not as bad as it looks .
we just didn't have time to clear it all up .
the dining room there got the worst of it .
but i always did want to do that room over .
the upstairs is quite all right .
yeah .
darling , we'll have to get some blankets up there and black that place out .
toby , old boy .
vin !
vin .
hello , toby .
carol .
that was wonderful .
did you have a nice trip?
it was fine .
i've had the mumps .
oh , this was a lovely surprise .
all right , children , let carol go now .
come on , vin .
i'll take you up to your room .
it's your old room , of course , vin , but we made a few changes .
yeah , the jerries made a few more .
thank your father too , darling .
i'll do that right away and bring up the rest of the luggage .
thanks for the lovely room .
and thanks for vin .
he is nice , isn't he?
i wonder if you know how much i love him .
i only have to look at you .
and him .
have you seen the view here?
it's really beautiful .
oh , it is .
you're happy?
of course .
i've had a lifetime of happiness in these last two weeks .
but , carol , that's only the beginning .
kay , i'm not afraid to face the truth .
are you?
no .
i love him , but i know ...
carol .
i know that i may lose him .
he's young and he loves life , but he may die .
let me say it .
he may be killed any day , any hour .
you must have faced that in your mind .
yes , i've faced it .
then you know that every moment is precious .
we mustn't waste time in fear .
you won't hate me for saying this , will you?
no , carol .
i will be very happy .
every moment that i have him .
every moment .
if i must lose him , there'll be time enough for tears .
there'll be a lifetime for tears .
that's right , isn't it?
well , that's the lot .
all my wife's .
say , have you noticed her crested dressing case?
swank , eh?
have we time to unpack?
yes .
we won't lunch till 1 .
i promised we'd be at the flower show by 3 .
can't miss the entertainment .
the glee club has a new number .
there will now be an interlude by the belham band .
hello , ballard .
how are you?
all right , thanks .
good luck .
the best of luck to you .
thank you .
i hope you get it , ballard .
thanks .
bickles .
yes , milady .
hurry that paper from the judges .
we want to get through with it .
the judges are still debating , milady .
what?
whatever for?
ridiculous creatures .
go and tell them i want that decision at once .
yes , milady .
have you seen old ballard's rose?
no , i haven't .
that's a lie .
i looked it over the moment it arrived .
well?
it's a good rose .
is it better than yours?
that , young man , the judges will decide .
you should worry .
you'll get the cup .
you insinuating the judges are corrupt?
they're scared of you .
oh , rubbish .
scared .
the decision on the rose award , milady .
well , mr. vincent miniver , take a look at that .
congratulations .
i'm not a bit surprised .
set yourself up to know more than the judges , eh?
misguided young man .
can't think what you see in him , carol .
this is really important to you , isn't it?
yes .
it's stupid of me , but there it is .
i've won that cup for as long as i can remember .
mr. ballard's terribly keen too .
well , he's had his chance .
hasn't he?
you have such a way of looking at people .
what do you expect me to do?
reverse the judges 'decision?
i wouldn't put it past you .
lf you happened to disagree with it .
but i don't !
will your ladyship make the awards now?
certainly .
this rose award , it's your unprejudiced decision?
why , certainly , milady .
of course , milady .
won't you sit down?
sit down .
my friends of belham , it is once again my pleasure ... ... to present the annual awards for the best flowers grown in our community .
the first prize chrysanthemums .
first prize , miss alice lovedean .
second prize , miss sarah pillbury .
congratulations .
thank you , milady .
and now , ladies and gentlemen , i come to the final award .
the challenge cup , given for the best rose ...
the best rose grown in the village during the past year .
the first prize , the silver cup , goes to ...
goes to mr. james ballard , our popular stationmaster .
the second prize , the certificate of merit ... ... goes to me .
all right .
all right .
all right .
all right .
this is the first time a rose other than the beldon rose ... ... has won the cup since the show's began .
i won't say i'm not disappointed .
we beldons are not used to competitors .
in the old days , we just lopped off their heads .
can't do that nowadays , more's the pity .
but if i had to lose ... ... there's no man i'd sooner lose to than james ballard ... ... because he's a man of spirit , and i like a man of spirit .
where are you?
ballard !
where's that man?
here he is , milady !
here he is !
oh , mr. ballard , i'm so happy for you .
it's your rose , ma'am .
excuse me , milady .
not now , foley .
well , take it .
thank you , milady .
congratulations .
pardon the liberty .
milady , enemy planes over the coast , hundreds of them .
like as not , they'll go after the airfield again .
order .
order .
silence !
i'm sorry to disturb the harmony of this occasion ... ... but our enemies are no respecters of flower shows .
foley here says there's a chance of air raiders passing this way .
in the circumstances , it might be better if you would return to your homes .
those who prefer are welcome to the use of my cellars .
it'll be lively .
my young visitors will see to that .
and you won't starve .
foley's seen to that .
i believe we have 300 tins of italian sardines .
granny , you'll be all right?
of course .
you're not leaving me alone .
you were wonderful .
they loved you .
vin needs to get back to the airfield .
yes , of course .
give them a blast for me , will you?
i shall certainly try .
wait .
i still like to be kissed , you know .
of course .
i say , you were wonderful .
yes , i was wonderful .
goodbye .
goodbye .
goodbye , carol .
jerries over london in hundreds .
i'll have to run .
goodbye , darling .
goodbye , mother .
vin .
he'll be all right , carol .
we must get on , carol .
i'm anxious to get back to the children .
do you think the foley girl will take the children into the shelter?
of course .
don't worry , kay .
they seem to be fighting right over our heads .
i want so much to get home .
i hate to stop , but i suppose i'd better .
it could be vin .
it could !
no , carol , no .
it's not possible .
there hasn't been time .
oh , no .
how horrible .
those were bullets .
and i was sure they hit the car .
i really was frightened .
of all the ...
oh , carol .
the village .
oh , how awful .
oh , we must get back there .
they need help .
carol .
carol , what is it?
carol .
carol , are you hurt?
oh , darling .
carol .
god , i think i've been hit .
oh , no , darling .
where?
i don't know .
it doesn't hurt .
i just can't move .
don't be frightened , we're nearly home .
i'll get you in and get help .
now , lie still .
yes , kay .
emergency .
emergency?
ambulance , at once .
all out?
but this is terribly urgent .
so is this , an air raid casualty that's terribly ...
well , the moment you get one in , the first possible moment ... ... send it to starlings .
no , starlings .
yes , the last house in norton lane .
yes , and hurry , please .
hurry .
they're coming as soon as they can .
i'll get a coat , darling .
they'll be here any moment now .
you won't tell vin?
of course not , darling .
darling .
you're going to be all right , carol .
i know you are .
don't be frightened , sweet .
i'm going to be all right .
i don't feel any pain .
what is it?
can i get you something?
glass of water .
of course , darling .
i'll be right back .
carol .
carol .
carol !
oh , god .
god .
god .
vin , dear .
it's all right , mother .
i know .
where is she?
vin , dear , won't you try and get a little rest?
where is she?
in your room .
i will read to you from psalm 91 .
i will say of the lord , he is my refuge and my fortress .
my god , in him will i trust .
surely , he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler ... ... and from the noisome pestilence .
thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night .
nor for the arrow that flieth by day .
nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness .
nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday .
he shall cover thee with his feathers ... ... and under his wings shalt thou trust .
his truth shall be thy shield and buckler .
we in this quiet corner of england ... ... have suffered the loss of friends very dear to us .
some close to this church .
george west , choirboy .
james ballard , stationmaster and bell ringer ... ... and the proud winner , only an hour before his death ... ... of the beldon cup for his beautiful miniver rose .
and our hearts go out in sympathy ... ... for the two families who share the cruel loss of a young girl ... ... who was married at this altar only two weeks ago .
the homes of many of us have been destroyed ... ... and the lives of young and old have been taken .
there's scarcely a household that hasn't been struck to the heart .
and why?
surely you must have asked yourselves this question .
why , in all conscience ... ... should these be the ones to suffer?
children , old people ... ... a young girl at the height of her loveliness .
why these?
are these our soldiers?
are these our fighters?
why should they be sacrificed?
i shall tell you why .
because this is not only a war of soldiers in uniform ... ... it is a war of the people .
of all the people .
and it must be fought not only on the battlefield ... ... but in the cities and in the villages .
in the factories and on the farms .
in the home and in the heart ... ... of every man , woman and child who loves freedom .
well , we have buried our dead ... ... but we shall not forget them .
instead , they will inspire us with an unbreakable determination ... ... to free ourselves and those who come after us ... ... from the tyranny and terror that threaten to strike us down .
this is the people's war .
it is our war .
we are the fighters .
fight it , then .
fight it with all that is in us .
and may god defend the right .
