hey , curt , you guys gonna have a little bash your last night in town?
moose has been lookin 'for you all day .
he got worried .
thought you were tryin 'to avoid him .
what do you got?
oh , great .
that's $2, 000 , man . $2, 000 !
mr. jennings gave it to me to give to you .
he's sorry it's late .
it's the first scholarship the moose lodge has given out .
he says they're all very proud of you back at the lodge .
why don't you hold it for me?
i don't want it .
take it .
it's yours .
i'll take it .
listen , your sister calls .
i'll talk to you later .
wait a second .
she can wait .
make it short and sweet , huh?
listen , i don't think i'm gonna be going tomorrow .
come on .
what are you talking about?
i was thinkin 'i could wait a year , go to city for a while .
you chicken fink .
after all we went through to get accepted?
we're gettin 'out of this turkey town ... and now you wanna crawl back into your cell?
you wanna end up like john?
you just can't stay 17 forever .
get that through your head !
i just need some time .
i gotta go talk to laurie .
now take it .
take it !
we're leaving in the morning , all right?
we're leaving in the morning !
we gonna rock and roll ourselves to death , baby !
you got the wolfman jack show !
don't with the thing !
will you stop it with the big bopper stuff?
hi , john !
not too good , huh?
why is it every girl around here is ugly or has a boyfriend?
where is the dazzling beauty i've been searching for all my life?
i know what you mean .
the pickings are really gettin 'slim .
the whole strip is shrinkin '.
you know , i remember about five years ago ... it would take a couple of hours and a tank full of gas ... just to make one circuit .
it was really somethin '.
hey , john .
someone new in town .
are you gonna go after him?
hey , listen , professor .
if he can't find me , then he ain't even worth racin ', right?
big shot .
well?
where was i?
how you thought high school romances were goofy ... and we started dating only because you thought i was cute and funny ... but then you suddenly realized ... you were in love with me , it was serious ...
you were leadin 'up to somethin 'kinda big .
you make it sound like i'm giving dictation .
well , seriously ... what i meant was that ... since we do care for each other so much ... and since we should really consider ourselves as adults now ...
could i have a couple of those fries?
where was i?
consider ourselves adults .
right , right .
i thought , maybe before i leave ... we could agree that ...
seeing other people while i'm away can't possibly hurt , you know?
you mean dating other people?
it would strengthen our relationship .
then we'd know for sure that we're really in love .
not that there's any doubt .
i think you're right .
i mean , we're not kids anymore ... and it's silly to think that when we're 3, 000 miles apart ... we shouldn't be able to see other people and go out .
laurie , listen .
i didn't ask for that back .
i know .
i just sort of think it's juvenile now .
i'll keep it at home .
it's less conspicuous there .
you don't wanna wear it?
i didn't say that .
i understand , and i'm not upset .
i can't expect you to be a monk while you're away .
i got a really neat record collection .
i even got " pledging my love " by johnny ace .
how can you love nelson when he's going out with marilyn gator?
since he dumped on you ...
he didn't dump on me , you little dip !
oh , hi , steve .
hey , sis .
what's wrong?
nothing .
what is it?
nothing !
i've decided to let you take care of my car while i'm away .
at least until christmas .
i'm comin 'back for a couple of weeks at christmas .
i've got some very simple instructions for you .
here's the keys .
first of all , only 30 weight castrol r.
i've written the tire pressure and stuff on a pad in the glove ...
are you listening?
hey , what's wrong?
are you crying?
i can't believe it !
i don't know what to say !
i'll love and protect this car until death do us part .
this is a super fine machine .
this might even be better than darryl starbird's superfleck moon ...
it is !
it's better than darryl starbird's superfleck moonbird .
budda?
how'd you like to go to the drive in movies with me?
you gotta be kidding .
would i kid about a thing like that?
i have a new car .
did she do that to you?
curt , you wanna bomb around?
i wanna try out my new wheels .

did you get it?
you got it !
you didn't get it .
why didn't you get it?
i needed some things and i thought as long as i was in there ...
look , debbie , can you loan me a dollar?
are you for real?
come on .
girls don't pay .
guys pay .
see , i've only got a 50 , and he doesn't have change .
i can't believe this .
i really cannot believe this .
here .
excuse me .
could you ...
buy you a bottle of booze?
yeah , i know .
you lost your i. d. what kind do you want?
gee , that's terrific .
just some old harper?
that one over there ... that's freddy benson's 'vette .
he had a head on collision with a drunk .
boom !
didn't have a chance .
he was a good driver too .
it's pretty grim when a guy gets it and it's not even his own fault .
needs a paint job , that's for sure .
see that over there?
that '41?
that used to be ... believe it or not ... the fastest car in the valley .
i never got a chance to race earl , though .
he got his 1955 in about the hairiest crash we ever had here .
