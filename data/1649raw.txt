take some shooting lessons , asshole !
she's open .
have a seat .
captain .
did you hear?
the drive by shooting?
disgusting !
you know who'll have to take the heat again ... ... when the shit hits the fan .
you're retiring a little early .
you won't be getting your full pension .
yes , sir , that's right .
i won't .
this isn't because you were wounded , is it?
wounded?
because , i mean ... ... you're behind a desk now .
not much chance of getting wounded there .
look , captain , it has nothing to do with that .
i'll make my speech .
they make me do this , you understand .
i hate to lose a good cop .
not too late to change your mind .
lot of good cops want to drop the whole kit and caboodle .
and who wouldn't?
the pay stinks ... ... and you're up to your ears in human scum 16 hours a day .
but it gets in your blood .
a lot of good cops get to the point of ... ... slapping their badge down on this desk ... ... and find they just can't do it .
how about you?
will you stick with the team?
no , captain .
i don't think i will .
like i say , they make me ask .
you understand .
how are the kids?
i don't have any .
what the hell?
i'd like to take my stick to these clerks .
the file says ...
we lost a child .
lost it?
her .
lost her .
yes , of course .
her .
that's rough .
well , it can be .
yes , sir .
still married , right?
yes , sir , i am .
that's good .
where you going?
i'm going home .
not this way .
why not?
metrorail construction , that's why not .
go around .
just follow your tootsies .
you sure you don't want something?
coffee , soda , something?
no , thank you , ma'am .
i feel kind of stupid about this .
better safe than sorry .
that's what i thought .
you have a restraining order against your husband?
ex husband .
he'd show up on the wrong day ... ... or in the middle of the night , pounding on the door .
thing is , he has this horrendous temper .
i didn't know if a restraining order was a good idea ... ... and if it'd do more harm than good .
but the judge said we should make an example of him .
so he can't come within 100 feet of us .
or is it yards?
which is it?
feet or yards?
that's up to the judge .
i thought it was a set thing .
it's at his discretion .
that's interesting .
does he drink?
oh , i thought you meant the judge !
no , i wouldn't say so .
do drugs?
but he has a propensity for violence?
yeah , i think you could say that .
did he strike the little girl?
did he strike you?
not exactly .
not exactly?
you know , there were times ... ... when i thought he was going to ... ... but i just didn't want to wait until he got around to it .
it's hard to explain .
he could , i think .
you think?
hello , sir .
how are you today?
i'm doing all right .
how about you?
me?
i'm terrible .
i'm sorry .
i came from santa barbara , and my friend wasn't home ... ... and he owes me money ... ... so i have no money to go home .
i'm almost out of gas .
i had to sleep in my car .
do you have a few bucks?
it would really help me out .
give me your address , i'll mail it back .
honest .
let me see your driver's license .
what for?
it'll have your address on it .
i don't have a license .
you drove all the way without it?
are you a cop?
let's see your car registration and your car .
all right , forget it .
okay , just forget it !
that's a hell of a way to treat a vet , man .
you're an animal doctor?
no , a veteran .
i was in nam .
you must've been 10 years old .
i meant to say the gulf .
come on !
all i'm asking for is a little change .
i haven't eaten in three days .
well , i mean , except for this .
fuck it !
give me some money , man .
just give me some money .
how about a dime?
give it to me .
i'm not giving you any .
you got a cigarette?
no .
you gotta give me something .
why don't you get a job?
this is my park .
i live here !
who are you , walking through my park with two bags?
i don't got any .
is that fair?
what's in those bags , anyway?
give me one .
i could sell those bags and eat for a week with the money .
you've got two of them .
why do you need two?
you're right .
here .
are you serious?
i don't need it anymore .
all right !
come on , now .
come on .
what the ...
son of a bitch !
can we cut the crap this time?
i'm telling you the truth !
yeah , right .
what's up?
she was at the drive by shooting .
angie , who hit your guys?
i told you .
we know .
the big bad white man .
we're not buying it .
who are you protecting?
they put your boyfriend in the hospital .
he's probably dead .
do you realize that?
he's probably fucking dead !
stop saying that !
you picked a good day to leave .
you want another 3 year old to get shot in the head?
is that what you want?
tell me the truth !
i'm telling you the truth !
it was a white guy !
why would he go after your friends?
i don't know !
he attacked them on angel's flight hill with a baseball bat !
a baseball bat?
wait !
baseball bat .
what did this guy look like?
i don't know .
he looked like you ... ... except he was taller and had hair .
good description , angie !
did he wear a white shirt and tie?
come over here , will you?
we gotta keep the pressure on her .
don't interrupt .
what about the bat?
the white shirt and tie !
what will she think of next?
i'm sorry you're leaving , but you are .
sanchez , listen to me !
check me later , babe .
remember that storekeeper , the korean guy?
mr. lee?
come here .
where was his place?
right there .
he was assaulted sometime after 8 a .
m.?

and the drive by was here , right?
what's going on?
i may be nuts , but angel's flight hill is between those two spots .
it was a classy neighborhood .
it's a shit hole .

she could've been anything .
anything but a cop's wife .
she's high strung .
don't give me that queen of the hop , homecoming queen bullshit again .
that was a long time ago .
sandra , you have a career .
it's hard to lose your beauty when that's all you've got .

sorry to break this up .

i'm going away now !
i'm going away , everybody !
this is what happens if you're not economically viable !
don't let this happen to you !
bye , everybody !
don't forget me .
i'm sorry .
we're leaving now .
you are?
really?
it doesn't look like your husband's gonna show .
he probably realized he could get into trouble if he harassed you .
you should call your lawyer and tell him about it .
it's one of those services .

have them call your husband's lawyer , make it official .
in the meantime , lock up .

heat seeking , shoulder fired .
it's fucking disposable !
you can take out a jet with one of these monkeys .
it's for you .
i want you to have it .

because i'm with you .
don't you get it?
i listened to the scanner .
i heard about whammyburger .
fucking fantastic !
it's a bunch of niggers , right?
on tv , it's always white kids .
but when you go in there , it's nothing but a bunch of niggers !
they'll spit on your food if you're not nice .
i know all about it .
i'm with you .
we're the same , you and me .

freedom of religion .

i'm listening .
we got a nutcase with a bag full of guns .
he's in hollywood , heading west .
what is he up to?
he's up to a lot of trouble .
never mind , we've got a hallway full of suspects .
it wasn't a gang thing .
i can tell you that .
angelina is a tramp and a liar .
we don't appreciate you interfering with our investigation .
i've got a positive i. d. on the gym bag , okay?
what's this?
a gym bag .
does this mean you're putting me under arrest?
you guys take off .
i gave you that speech earlier ... ... because that's regulations .
they make me do it .
this one's from me .
i've never liked you .
you know why?
you don't curse .
i don't trust a man who doesn't curse .
not a " fuck " or a " shit " in all these years .
real men curse .
and i don't like a man who's afraid to hit the street .
it's bad for morale .
i'm not afraid .
get back behind that desk where you belong ... ... and don't waste any more of my time pretending you're a cop .
a man in a white shirt and tie shot up a phone booth near the whammyburger .
did you hear me?
i heard you .
right about here , right?
how did you know?
he got the bag of guns at the drive by .
then you were right .
excuse me .
what is wrong with you?
me?
i'm a coward , the captain told me .
get out of my way .
hey , look .
it is your own fault .
you let everybody think that , when it was your wife .
she made you get off the street .
what happens between me and my wife is nobody's business but mine !
sorry , i've been a bitch all day .
she didn't make me quit .
i came home late one night ... ... and found her sitting in the dark .
she thought i'd been killed .
she thought i was a ghost .
i had to chase her all over the house .
i'm sorry .
forget it .
where are you going?
see if i can earn my last day's pay .
let me go with you .
i thought you were on duty .
what do you say , partner?
fuck them !
go !
who were you talking to a while ago?
you're trying to scare me .
am i succeeding?
no , you're not succeeding .
so you just might as well stop it .
and you're not scaring me out of my own house .
and you're not coming here .
but i am .
i'm on my way .
you can count on that .
i'm past the point of no return .
do you know when that is?
that's the point in a journey ... ... where it's longer to go back to the beginning ... ... than it is to continue to the end .
it's like ...
remember when those astronauts got in trouble?
they were going to the moon and something went wrong .
they had to get back to earth ... ... but they had passed the point of no return .
so they had to go all the way around the moon to get back ... ... and they were out of contact for hours .
everybody waited to see if a bunch of dead guys in a can ... ... would pop out the other side .
that's me .
on the other side of the moon now ... ... out of contact ... ... and everybody's just going to have to wait till i pop out .
the police are here .
did you know , beth ... ... that in certain south american countries it's still legal ... ... to kill your wife if she insults you?
they're here right now .
i'm looking at one right now .
put him on the phone .
what are we gonna do?
talk to the korean guy .
then we just start banging on doors .
what is it?
where are you going?
i'll be right back .
i'm sure the guy will let you use his bathroom .
prendergast , what are you doing?
i know who this guy is !
who is he?
he had a personalized license plate .
what the hell was it?
it said , " d fens .
defense?
d dash f e n s.

they said he was on his way home .
go check out his address .
mr. lee !
defense !

you cut me off !
what's wrong with you !
move back !
out of the way !
what are you , a moron?
if i wanted to be in a parking lot , i'd buy a ticket , you dumb bitch !
you can't come this way .
what are you doing?
fixing the street !
what does it look like?
two days ago , it was fine .
you're saying it fell apart in two days?
well , i guess so .
pardon me , but that's bullshit !
i don't think anything's wrong with the street .
you're trying to justify your budgets .
are you nuts?
i know how it works .
if you don't spend your budget , you won't get any money next year .
i want you to admit nothing's wrong with the street !
fuck you , pal !
you're not gonna hold us hostage with these yellow lights and big trucks .
i'm just here to keep people from falling in .
that's all .
i want to hear it from you .
what's wrong with the street?
i don't know .
i really don't .
i think it's a sewer job .
you're lying .
what's wrong with the street?
nothing .
i knew it .
see , i knew it was fine .
but i'll give you something to fix .
oh , jesus ...
here !
hey , charlie !
oh , please , man !

it's all right .
where's the cameras?
the cameras are on .

look at it and pull the trigger .
it's really easy .
trigger?

it's the groundskeeper .
well , if he is , he's out of uniform .
hey , you there !
what are you doing there?

nobody said you could play through .
get off my hole .
he said he was passing through .
he's not a member .
look how he's dressed .
get off my golf course !
i am !
go back the way you came !
i don't like his looks .
leave him alone .
what am i paying dues for?
this is my golf course !
if i want to play here , i will !
if he gets hit with my titleist , that's his problem !
don't yell at me .
i'm just here playing with you ...
fore !
fore !
five !
wait a minute !
what the hell you trying to do?
kill me with a golf ball?
it's not enough you got all this land for your little game?
but you had to kill me with a golf ball?
you should have children playing here .
family picnics .
you should have a petting zoo ... ... instead of electric carts for you old men with nothing better to do .
frank , what's wrong?
frank !
aren't you ashamed of yourself?
i gotta get some help !
what's wrong with you?
help !
your heart?
something's wrong with your heart?
what can i do?

pills !
pills?

my friend just had a heart attack !
i guess you're out of luck .
your little cart's gonna drown .
aren't you sorry you didn't let me pass through your golf course?
now you're gonna die wearing that stupid little hat .
how does it feel?
this is his room .
you're a very neat and tidy lady .
he cleans his own room .
now don't make me call you a liar .
if he wasn't at work , i'd be afraid to set foot in here .
what's he been doing lately?
same as ever .
building important things to protect us from the communists .
he works at notec .
the defense plant .
d fens .
call notec and see if you can get him .
so what's going on with your son?
how do you mean?
you know exactly what i mean .
sometimes he sits through an entire meal without saying a word .
he just shovels food into his mouth like a machine .
i get so nervous ... ... i can't swallow .
i'll sit there with the same piece of food in my mouth .
i have to spit it out .
when i do , he looks at me ... ... like he'd like to kill me .
don't tell him i said that .
i promise i won't .
i try not to be a burden .
i'm not just talking financial .
how could you be a burden to anyone?
if william , or bill , as i like to call him ...
he likes bill .
i call him bill too .
if bill said he was going home ... ... could he have meant where his wife and child live?
ex wife .
we shouldn't be in here .
ex wife , right .
elizabeth .
what's her maiden name?
trevino .
she was part italian .
you know how they are .
where's elizabeth now?
i wouldn't know .
you don't know where your grandchild lives?
he doesn't want me to know .
he blames me for what happened .
what's the word?
he was fired over a month ago .
what?
where has he been going every day?
where has he been eating his lunch?
why are you putting barbed wire on that fence?
is it a joke?
is this how rich people have fun?
you put barbed wire on the fence ... ... so innocent people like me can cut our hands?
no , please .
i'm the caretaker .
it's just a barbecue .
dr. ashcroft has let us do this before .
you don't live here?
is it really necessary to tell them?
tell who?
altmore security .
aren't you with them?
no , please !
it's okay , honey .
it's okay , baby .
what kind of doctor lives here?
plastic surgeon .
plastic surgery bought all this?
guess i'm in the wrong racket .
are there correspondence courses in plastic surgery?
i lost my job .
actually , i didn't lose it .
it lost me .
i'm overeducated , underskilled ...
maybe it's the other way around .
i forget .
and i'm obsolete .
i'm not economically viable .
i can't even support my own kid .
are you hurt?
i'm sorry .
i didn't hurt you , honey .
i'm sorry .
it's all right .
it's your hand .
you cut your hand .
it's my hand .
please take me with you .
they won't do anything if i'm with you .
just please let them go .
what do you think?
you think i want to hurt your family?
i have a family of my own .
you don't believe me?
we believe you .
that's where i'm going .
i'm going home to see my family .
it's my little girl's birthday today .
we were gonna have a barbecue , like you guys ... ... and she was gonna play outside ... ... and my wife would hold my hand ... ... and talk about grownup things .
and then when it got dark ... ... we'd all go to sleep together .
we'd all sleep together in the dark .
and everything ... ... would be just like it was before .
you can't leave .
believe me , something's happened to him .
it doesn't take all day to drive from pasadena to venice .
that doesn't constitute a threatening phone call .
the guy was talking about star trek or something .
he's getting a kick out of scaring you .
please don't leave .
there's only one thing you can do to really feel safer .
next time there's a proposition ... ... to cut the number of patrol cars on the street , vote no , okay?
have a nice day .
what have you found so far?
no luck on foster trevino .
go straight to the maiden name .
i've got something on an army navy store .

that guy was a prick .
you know what else he was?
murdered .
they found him stuffed in his own display case .

where are we going?
when's my birthday?
some g. i. joe gave a geezer a heart attack at the golf course ... ... and accosted a family right next door .

god bless the working stiffs !
please leave her alone !
you're so big !
how'd you get so big?

you ain't kidding .
would you believe it that i used to fish right here?
this very spot?
now they tell you , " don't eat the fish .
it's poisonous .
you can't even swim in the water .
it'll give you some kind of bacterial infection .
how's that for sick?
i'm having a private moment with my family .
leave us alone .
i'm leaving soon .
i'm retiring to arizona .
lake havasu city .

that's not what i mean !
they call it a lake , but it's really just a big bowl of muddy water .
but the wife thinks it's paradise .
everybody has their own idea of what paradise is .
take me , for instance .
you know what i thought paradise was?
what?
lf you'll excuse me .
making babies .
ain't that a kick?
making babies .
this your little girl?
beautiful .
she's special .
you know , my wife never was cut out for motherhood .
she did it all for me .
went through all that pain , lost her figure , for me .
then the kid went to sleep one night , never woke up .
they called it " infant death ... ... syndrome .
but she wasn't an infant .
she was 2 years old .
she was a big girl .
she was our baby .
here , darling , this is for you .
here you go .
what can you do?
if she'd been hit by a drunk driver ...
but who do you blame when they just don't wake up?
thank you , sweetheart .
there's a guy with a gun !
no !
don't !
elizabeth , no !
freeze !
you're under arrest .
get out of here !
freeze !
what were you gonna do?
i don't know !
guys like you always say that !
you know exactly what you were gonna do .
kill your wife and child !
then it'd be too late to turn back .
it'd be easy to kill yourself .
let's go meet some nice policemen .
they're good guys .
let's go .
i'm the bad guy?
how did that happen?
i did everything they told me to .
did you know i build missiles?
i help to protect america .
you should be rewarded for that .
instead , they give it to the plastic surgeon .
they lied to me .
is that what this is about?
you're angry because you got lied to?
is that why my dinner's drying out in the oven?
they lie to everybody .
they lie to the fish !
that doesn't give you any right to do what you did today .
the only thing that makes you special is that little girl .
now , let's go .
let's go !
