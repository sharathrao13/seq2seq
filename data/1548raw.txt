i'm scared , serafina !
you?

of what?
of whom?
a man who come to the farm and kept chasing after me
because you're beautiful , silly !

no ... he wants to kill me .
i know he does
i know .
listen and answer me .
does he know you're here?
no .
then , forget about that !

my pretty little fatso ...
one more , please
you are terrible !
always asking for credit , and now this !
no way !
nobody owes me money !

this should hold you for a little while
that's much better .
what about her?
it looks like she's not used to this ... poor thing !
what about you?
no kiss?
no way !
i rather pay !
that's too bad , since her man ...
this woman is much smarter than you
forget it !
that's just talk .
everybody knows that
lf he's really getting married , poor thing !
it's time now .
they are arriving
take anything you want !
ls everybody crazy?
you're not going to see him?
who?
she doesn't know him yet .
when she does , she'll run even faster than the others .
are you taking that?
no way , that's green !
green , green of course !
did you want a red chayote?
this can't be !
poor baby !

could you make the sun rise tomorrow?
sure !
even better , since tomorrow is carnival !
what do you play to do that?
i make it up .
and you?

i could make up a melody !
i'd love to make the sun rise
give him the guitar .
just to ckeck it out
this is a very old guitar ...
" orpheus is my master " .
yes , that's true
there was an orpheus before me .
and one may come after i'm gone but i'm the one ruling now .
do you understand that?
don't be sad .
don't tell anybody , ok?
i will play a new song i just wrote
pretty , isn't it?
morning , such a pretty morning
a new song is born
singing of your eyes , your laughter , your hands
there will be a day when you come
from the strings of my guitar
that only your love sought
a voice comes and talks about kisses
kisses lost in your lips
sing , my heart , happiness is back
ln the dawn of this love
what are you doing here?
i have the right to ...
zeca , take the guitar !
you didn't see me !
lsn't he here?
who?
was that you playing?
orpheus taught me
where is he?
he just left with a woman
what?
since you have the guitar , play something
he'll hear me
that's even better .
play
you again?
what are you doing here?
why didn't you tell me that serafina is your cousin?
so , we are close .
what's your name?
don't you remember?
i'm eurydice
wonderful !
i like you already !
of course !
orpheus likes eurydice , as the story goes
are you orpheus?
yes , i am .
from head to toe .
but i ...
i don't like you
yes , you do !
try to remember .
this is really an old story
thousands of years ago , orpheus was sad and melancholic
like the bird trapped in this cage
one day , from the strings of a guitar , sought by only one love , a voice spoke of lost kisses from the lips of eurydice
and eurydice's lips were trembling with anxiety ... and the perfumed flower of her mouth opened slightly
no !
you are too young to remember
yes ...
i remember the words you sang ... because they are the same !
exactly !
but it was the melody i liked best
forgive me , eurydice
look
i need to talk to him
no , leave them alone !
orpheus , they're waiting for you at the rehearsal !
yes !
well ...
i need to go
i know
i'll sing and dance for you !
are you coming?
yes , i am
take good care of her !
let's go !
see you later
thanks
why aren't you paying any attention to me?
i have no time now
answer me !
go back to your place !
i'm sorry .

and who is she?

she is pretty , isn't she?
yes
she is orpheus 'fiance
look , he's going to kiss her
ok , that's enough !
what's so funny?
nothing !
that's enough !
why didn't you kiss me?
leave me alone .
have you tried on your costumes?
of course !
mira's costume is a beauty , isn't it?
it has embroidered sleeves .
let's go see it
come and dance , eurydice , come
come on !
and who is that?
ask orpheus !

ln the eyes of my girlfriend
lt's like this night , passing
seeking the dawn speak low , please
so she might wake up happy
look ... it's rising
offering a kiss of love
it's true
sadness has no end
happiness does
happiness is like a drop of dew
on a flower's petal
brilliant and tranquil , then quivering
then falling like a tear of love

it's me .
hermes also came
i've nothing left in life
i am poorer than the poorest of the black men
seek mercy , my son .
we are all poor and ... what's left to be said is the poor people's word thanks
i ask you for mercy , hermes
all i can do is give you mercy
here .
i have already done everything that had to be done
i think that you'll get true mercy there
thank you , hermes
no , my son .
you are going to thank eurydice
yes
are you going to take her yourself?
all right .
come with me
lf you don't want it , it's always interesting ... having another cadaver for the doctors , for science
and it is also cheaper for you
it is my duty to ask that question , because of them ... and , the truth is , when one is here ...
carnival is over , there is nothing one can do
would you like to try and identify her?
careful , you'll get a cold dressed like that
death is cheap here , right?
careful !
you're shaking
the same thing happens to me
lt doesn't help to be careful .
l have a cold all year round
everything is beautiful , eurydice
my heart is a bird whose thirst is quenched by a drop of dew
thank you , eurydice .
thank you for this new day
you are the one who carries me
i am in your arms , like a sleeping child
the sweet breath of your chest
i know you will take me where i must go
thank you , eurydice .
the path you chose is full of flowers
the sun is rising to embrace us , my love
you are singing , eurydice
the happiness of the poor is the great illusion of carnival
we work all year long
