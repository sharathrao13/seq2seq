who said anything about sex points?

european babes are charming and sophisticated , especially the french .
hence the hairy pits .

she's not my type .
oh , come on !

serafine?
uh , hi .
uh , it's the guy who , um
i've got your shoe .
hi , i'm andy .
we met on the tower .
this is chris and brad .
and , uh
listen , i thought that you would want this .
and , well , it's not my size .
you're very kind .
now , go , please .
you must not stay here .
charming .
and sophisticated .
forget about it .
let's go , andy .
wait !
did you see what i saw?
what?
she had blood on her hands .
she's trying it again .
just so we're on the same page , who's crazier here?
please go , or there will be trouble .
uh no , wait , wait .
what did you do to your hand?
do you have blood on your hand?
you're bleeding?
no .
i , uh
it's just paint .
i'm redecorating the cellar .
oh .
i thought , uh
please , go , now .
wait .
listen .
hold it .
we can help .
we could have that done in no time .
right , guys?
no , thanks .
thank you .
l
please , look .
i just wanna talk .
i don't think it's a good idea .
please , just once . lf you let me , we'll never bother you again .
okay .
uh
tomorrow , 4 : 00 , in front of the concert hall?
you mean it?
i promise .
now , go , please .
excellent .
i did it .
you mean you almost blew it .
you got to play it cool .
first thing we're gonna do is work on your outfit .
now , okay .
remember .
eighty percent of all these french girls really go for that macho type .
whoa , bonin 'up on the playboy .
excellent .
don't show any insecurities .
it's the worst .
and , uh
split .
she's comin '.
here .
be prepared .
wait .
come on , chris .
it's our first date .
are you a nun?
be cool , and show attitude .
serafine .
hi .
hi .
i didn't recognize you .
oh , yeah .
um well , it's bright .
what would you like to do?
i don't know . ls there a cafe?
we're in paris .
oh .
mademoiselle .
merci .
monsieur .
merci beaucoup .
so , do your parents mind us , uh , meeting?
my parents are dead .
you okay?
need some water?
no , i'm fine .
i do like coffee .
most guys who ask me on a date are usually trying to get me into bed .
that must be really terrible for a girl when that happens .
why should i think you're any different?
lsn't that why you brought your friends along?
to witness you score?
no , that's not it at all .
chewing gum .
it's , uh , the rage in the states .
they take chewing gum .
they make it look like condoms .
it's like a practical joke .
nice .
and chewy .
i want you to blow a big bubble for me .
what?
well , it's a custom in france .
the bigger the bubble , the more a boy likes a girl .
wow .
what a rip off .
my friends told me it was chewing gum .
i thought
i think it's best if i go .
no , no , please , don't go .
i'm just so nervous .
and the more i like a girl , the more nervous i get .
and if you go now and something happens to you , then i'd blame myself for the rest of my life because i'd blown my chance to help .
the moment i saw you on the tower , i was so moved by your sadness .
i swore to myself i would try to help , whatever it takes .
no one as beautiful and sensitive as you ... can possibly deserve to be so sad .
oh , god .
i hate myself .
i am not the kind of guy you think i am .
lf i go , it's nothing to do with you .
no one can help me .
and anyone who tries is
i hope you're not sorry that i saved your life .
it was the sweetest , most courageous ... and selfless thing anyone's ever done for me .
monsieur , is this yours?
uh  [ speaking ln french ]
hey , you don't use
arrete !
huh?
hey , don't you lay a finger on her .
hey , you were somethin 'else in there !
i'm sorry .
i got carried away .
oh , no , that guy had it coming to him !
uh , hey .
how did you do that?
that that guy , he weighed i don't know .
uh
do you do you work out?
do you want me to leave?
i guess that means yes .
wait .
stop .
i have to go now .
you mustn't get involved .
wait .
when do i get to see you again?
i don't think we should .
andy , it's only because i care about you .
you have a funny way of showing it .
relax , man .
she's just playing hard to get .
this whole mysterious elusive thing is just a ploy to make her more interesting .
it's not that simple .
the way she talks about her parents , it's like she blames herself .
yeah .
she's demented enough .
remember the blood on her hands?
that stunt at the cafe?
it's like she's a black belt or somethin '.
bonsoir .
je peux vous aider?
um , we're just
americans?
yeah .
i love americans .
may i help?
uh , yeah .
we're looking for serafine .

i gotta go .
shh .
my friends .
you mustn't .
please .
this will relax you , no?
i don't get it .
last time we met , you threw bricks at me .
listen .
you're not the same as you used to be .
only since i met you .
seriously .
there's something i have to tell you , but you have to promise me you're not gonna freak out , okay?
no , i'm a rock .

elle est la .
oh , my god .
that's not all .
detective ben bou .
i had him follow you .

wait here a moment .
thanks for a lovely evening , douche bag .
you really know how to show a girl a good time , don't you?
no , no , no , no !
you're dead !
no !
i ain't so lucky .
i'm " un dead .
and as your rotting sidekick , i am cursed to remain a restless spirit until you die .
not so fast .
lf you want my buddy dead , nut ball , you're gonna have to wait .
i need him first .
he's no use to me as a corpse .
spent four years on stairmaster to get a package like this .
you ripped it like a lamb chop .
don't blame me , andy .
i warned you .
wait .
you mean , you knew this all along?
oh !
hey , keep it down out there !
a guy can't rest in pieces around here .
i'm losing my freaking skull .
come on .
pull yourself together , andy .
you gotta get outta here .
the cops wanna put you away for life .
i've had enough of your ridiculous theories .
the man is dangerous .
lock him up !
mcdermott , you're
i didn't choose to become a werewolf .
i can't face eating people the rest of my life .
better get used to it .
lsn't there any way that i can become human again?
yeah , there is , but you're not gonna like it .
tell me .
how?
first , find the werewolf that bit you .
then kill it .
then eat out its heart .
what?
but that means
serafine?
l no way .
andy , look out !
what did you do that for?
'cause i still need him .
he's gonna help kill the guy who did this to me .
i feel sick .
all of this would be over right now if you hadn't opened your fat trap .
you are the most egocentric corpse i've ever met .
listen , i don't know what kind of friend this jerk is to you , but he ate my spleen .
so , hey .
you guys are werewolves too , huh?
super .
glad to know ya .
andy .
i don't think you have accepted the gift that has been given to you ... or much less appreciated it .
we have a mission , andy : to purify the world .
that's why we pick our victims from the scum of society .
the governments of the world spent billions on medicine , welfare , charity .
to what effect?
it only keeps alive the weak , the stupid , the lazy , who breed and multiply , weakening the human race .
all my men , i have chosen ... for their loyalty , their dedication to the coming age .
but you
you were not to have been .
you were an accident , an anomaly .
i do not wish to kill you .
i pray you will join us in our rise to become the new mankind .
pure , free of disease .
free from the trappings of technological advance .
will you join us , andy?
i don't know .
that's , you know that's a big decision .
mm hmm .
i'm gonna need some time to think about that .
sure .
andy?
well , what's that for?
kill him , andy .
cut out his heart .
wait .
couldn't we just [ sighs ]
release him , andy .
join us .
you can't ask me to do this .
join us .
i'd rather die .
and so you shall .
andy !
serafine !
down there .
keep going .
jump !
but chris
jump !
follow me .
what?
did you know?
what is it?
did you know what he plans to do?
yes , i did .
and you did nothing to stop him?
andy , l  how in god's name could you just stand by
for god's sake !
stop it !
we may have a cure .
thierry , my stepfather .
claude?
no .
you?
and my mother too .
for a time , i had managed not to harm anyone .
even the hearts my mother smuggled from the hospital were from the dead .
two months ago , he was sure he had discovered ... a serum to suppress my lycanthropic cycle .
only it had the reverse effect .
i immediately transformed .
my mother heard the noise from upstairs , and thierry tried to escape through the underground .
when i came to ,
i saw i had butchered my own parents .
now do you see why i was trying to kill myself?
it's not your fault .
don't worry about me .
it's chris who has problems .
we gotta get him out of there .
claude is a bastard .
oh , brother , just who i need .
check the cellar !
leave him alone , claude .
out the back !
quick !
i warn you .
don't interfere again .
i am revved up see him fall into the trees
i am on my knees
i don't know if i can foot this bill
i'm supposed to leave [ barking ]
yoo hoo !
he's over here !
cut it out .
hey , he's hiding by the car !
qu'est ce qui se passe la?
he he's getting away !
fools !
get over here !
ah , c'est toi , le chauffeur !
i say , steady on , old man .
i never touched your car .
oh , oh .
great .
sera  hurry up !
serafine .
the cure . lf he dies , we have no hope .
serafine , it's he's gone .
let it go .
no .
yes .
they killed him , the bastards .
what do we do now?
well , let me have a shot at it .
but they ruined the lab .
so many years of hard work .
did your stepfather leave any notes?
there .
