cedric , later !
she looks a bit common .
she sleeps around too .
in the movies , you have to .
well , momo , want to be in the movies?
if i wasn't so old , i'd try it .
you?
i'm not made of stone .
imagine me in a boat with her ... ... and my wife .
the boat sinks .
what do i do?
i bet that my wife ... ... knows how to swim !
hello .
do you have any water?
of course , mademoiselle .
how much do i owe you?
five francs , mademoiselle .
i didn't know water was so rare here !
water isn't rare , mademoiselle ... ... true stars are .
thank you .
you've got nerve !
i have to make up for all the cans you pinch .
come here , momo .
i'll pay you back .
listen to me .
you owe me nothing .
if you have to steal , i prefer you do it in my shop .
look at me .
you owe me nothing .
picked tonight's menu?
come and see .
as a starter ... ... this cat food will fit the bill .
your father won't realize .
tell him it's farmhouse pate .
don't eat any yourself .
no need to buy bread every day .
warm it in the oven , and it'll be fine .
you can add a little chicory to his coffee .
dry the tea bags and you can use them again .
as for the eaujolais ... ... add a bit of this wine to the bottle each day .
for yourself , get what you like .
good evening .
bought more beaujolais?
yes , on special .
i got this pate .
what do you think?
not bad .
it's a bit expensive , though .
try it .
it's full of flavor .
no thanks , i'm not hungry .
stop , thief !
stop , thief !
stop him !
are you hurt?
you sweetheart !
thanks , angel !
when you grow up , come and see me sometime .
i'm 1 6 , you know .
i've already done it .
all right .
he's got guts .
moron .
what are you doing?
i'm cold .
close it !
the light ruins the bindings .
why are you showering all the time now?
i'm cold .
at least your brother wasn't like you .
why are you always thinking of him?
got nothing to do?
take a book .
he loved books .
you forgot to clean the shower yesterday .
think he'd have liked me?
what a question .
why don't you ever smile?
i can't afford to .
you think i'm rich?
your till's full of money .
that pays for the stock and the rent .
know how much i have left to live on?
not a lot .
excuse me , mademoiselle .
when i say smiling's for the rich ... ... i mean it's for happy people .
you're wrong .
smiling is what makes you happy .
like hell .
try it .
try it , you'll see .
just a second .
take this .
sauerkraut and meat , top quality .
thanks .
well?
don't look at me , look there .
it's obvious .
i'm sorry , i don't really understand .
all right .
i'll start again .
how about it?
it's thirty francs .
no problem .
you're already a reporter?
still a student .
reporter's a good job .
you travel ... ... you learn things , you see people .
you see people too .
and what's in them?
can you do me up?
you're beautiful when you smile .
i am?
a smile can work wonders .
sorry , i don't have a present .
see , it works .
you can get all you want .
evening , dad .
it's ready .
i got pate and beaujolais .
you've done something stupid .
look at me .
come here , let me see .
closer .
open wide .
you need braces .
your teeth are a mess .
forget something?
it's my fault .
if i was like paulie , dad would love me .
how do you know?
paulie left .
maybe he hated your dad .
you think so?
why else would he leave?
i bet he knew how to smile .
mom never had time to teach me .
did you know paulie?
i prefer you a hundred times .
i prefer you a hundred times .
help me .
it soothes the nerves .
he says i need braces , that i have crooked teeth .
let me see .
they're not that bad .
look at mine .
smile less , that'll do .
can you imagine your mouth full of metal?
the girls won't believe you're 1 6 .
you know about that?
i don't know anything .
i just know what's in my koran .
it's good to start off with professionals ... ... but afterwards , when you complicate things with feelings ... ... then you'll appreciate novices .
you go too .
at your age .
sorry .
heaven is for all of us , not just for minors .
how about a walk sunday afternoon?
you like walking?
you're always on that stool .
well?
a snapshot , gentlemen .
don't move .
living in paris must be fun .
but you live in paris .
no , i live on blue road .
it's too beautiful here for me .
you can find beauty wherever you look .
that's what my koran says .
should i read your koran?
if god wants to reveal life to you , he won't need a book .
i thought muslims didn't drink .
but i'm a sufi .
it's not a disease , it's a way of thinking .
although , some ways of thinking ... ... are diseases too .
mystical form of islam .
opposed to legalism , it stresses inner religion .
legalism : meticulous observance of the law .
opposed to legalism .
he's against the law .
he isn't always honest .
if respecting the law means being like him , that's terrible .
i'd rather be against legalism .
inner religion ....
dictionaries always use words you don't understand .
inner religion ....
i've been fired , moses .
i need to find a job ... ... somewhere else .
we have to tighten our belts .
how do you manage to be happy?
i know what's in my koran .
maybe i should pinch it one day .
although a jew shouldn't .
what does being jewish mean to you?
i don't know .
for my dad , it means being depressed all day .
for me , it's why i can't be different .
your shoes are no good .
we'll buy you some tomorrow .
i don't have any money .
it'll be my treat .
you only have one pair of feet .
look after them .
if your shoes hurt you , you change them .
you can't change your feet .
son ... ... excuse me , i've left .
i'm not cut out to be a father .
perhaps we'll meet again one day ... ... when you're a man ... ... when i'm less ashamed and you forgive me .
i've left my money on the table ... ... with a list of people to contact .
they'll take care of you .
goodbye .
you like it?
you know it?
look , it's easy .
try it .
dad has indigestion .
what can i give him?
fernet branca .
there .
i won't buy any more pate .
what can i do for him tonight?
ravioli?
great idea , ravioli .
a koran?
no .
why?
not here .
why?
my mom would murder me .
i'd murder her first .
silly .
when i bought these trousers , she called me a slut .
they look good on you .
you think so?
not just the trousers .
even though i threw water at you , i still fancied you .
i know .
you knew?
what do you want most of all?
nothing?
i'd like to meet my brother .
you have a brother?
he lives with my mom .
i hate him .
why?
if he was here , you'd be with him .
you wouldn't look at me .
no .
yes .
it kills me , knowing you could be with another guy .
is that true?
i think myriam's in love with me .
i'm in love with her anyhow .
i've even gone off sylvie .
how's your dad?
i haven't seen him lately .
he's working a lot .
he leaves early for his new job .
isn't he angry about the koran?
i hide to read it .
i don't understand much .
when you want to learn , you don't pick up a book .
you talk to someone .
thank you , madame .
but you always say you know  what's in my koran .
do you wash in the morning?
of course i wash .
i even change my socks every day .
thirty francs .
next time , bring a note from your father .
she has a new boyfriend since yesterday .
maybe she even knew him before .
i knew it .
there's always a paulie ... ... eating me up inside .
it doesn't matter .
your love for her is yours .
it belongs to you .
she rejects it , but she can't destroy it .
she's just missing out on it .
what you give , momo , is yours for good .
what you keep is lost forever .
do you have a wife?
yes .
how come we never see her?
let's cool off .
come on .
you didn't answer me .
momo , no answer is an answer .
you're circumcised too .
muslims are , like jews .
so you could be jewish .
this is my hand , this is my mouth .
i don't understand .
you can't understand everything with your mind .
where are you going?
leave me alone .
where are you going?
can't you tell?
it's shabbat .
i saw you with richard .
i know .
so what?
i don't want to see you again .
why?
why?
you're crazy !
stop it !
it's over !
coming to see me?
something wrong?
come on , i'll make it better .
come on .
paulle
who is it?
police .
we have some bad news , son .
your father's been found dead under a train near marseilles .
it looks as if he took his own life .
now ... ... you'll need to identify the body .
i don't want to see him .
who's he?
a friend of my father's .
a friend?
how good a friend?
my wife looked after momo .
have you been here long?
in france?
very long .
momo grew up here .
you know his father?
we ought to talk in private .
excuse me , momo .
is he sick?
he's burying my father .
i'm sorry .
suicide is worse than abandoning your kid .
excuse me , the door was open .
i'm looking for moses .
i'm his mother .
who are you?
they call me momo .
short for mohammed .
you're not moses?
i'm mohammed .
there's no moses here?
moses has gone , ma'am .
he has?
can i look round?
he was sick of being here .
he had bad memories .
is this his room?
i think so .
he likes music?
is he coming back?
i don't know .
he went to find his brother .
his brother?
paulie , i think .
yes , an older brother .
moses was my first child .
when will you adopt me?
tomorrow , if you want .
honest?
honest .
won't your wife mind?
my wife went back home a long time ago .
we'll go to see her if you want .
it's a quarter to five .
we're closed .
come back tomorrow at nine .
is lbrahim your first name or your surname?
ibrahim demirdji .
spell the surname .
if you were french , it would be tough enough .
but in this case ... ... in your situation ... ... it would take more than a miracle .
come to office 206 at 9 on monday .
it's an excellent vehicle .
four shock absorbers .
tax category seven .
you can get her up to 90 mph .
it was voted car of the year at the last motor show .
perhaps this one would be more suitable .
a v8 engine for flexibility .
don't give me your spiel , i'm buying this one .
do you have a license?
a license?
of course .
here you are .
this is a driving license?
of course .
can't you tell?
if i have to read arabic now .
follow me .
you can pay monthly installments over three years .
when i buy , i have the money .
here and now .
in that case , write a check for
no , i pay you now .
with cash .
here , real money .
you see?
no one pays in cash .
that's not possible .
why?
this isn't money?
i accepted it , why won't you?
we've come to the wrong place .
all right .
that's what we'll do .
we can deliver it in two weeks .
will that do?
two weeks?
i'll be dead in two weeks !
no , i want it tomorrow .
tomorrow , outside the store .
it's beautiful .
i forget , momo .
what?
you've driven before .
long ago , with my friend abdullah , but ....
but what?
the cars weren't like this .
they weren't drawn by horses .
no , my boy , donkeys .
but your license?
that was a letter from abdullah .
we're in the shit , then .
gently !
both feet like this .
you ease one off and press the other down .
gently .
a car's like a woman .
why didn't you say so?
she has ticklish feet .
okay , momo?
let's go .
gently .
there .
gently !
that's a bend to the right .
you slow down .
this one?
stop .
you slow down .
but i never go very fast .
obligatory stop .
you have to stop at 1 50 yards .
that's a yellow line .
you have those on all the roads .
an unbroken line !
yes , unbroken .
country roads are beautiful .
hold on .
an unbroken line and ....
an unbroken line ....
there are dotted lines too .
no overtaking !
i'm learning , momo .
but it makes my brain shrink .
before parking , what do you do?
before parking?
you slow down .
the indicator !
you forget everything !
i can't think of two things at once .
i know , you'll cough .
when you cough , i'll put the indicator on .
pull up there , behind the blue car .
stop the engine .
if there'd been a yellow line , what would you have done?
an unbroken one?
yes , unbroken .
but i used the indicator !
straight on .
straight on what?
unbroken yellow , straight on .
no overtaking .
okay .
you get your license , but only just .
i wanted to say goodbye .
we're going to turkey .
are you going away?
goodbye .
rich people live here .
look at the rubbish bins .
what about them?
to find out if a country ... ... is rich or poor , look at the bins .
if there are bins and no rubbish , it's rich .
if there's rubbish by the bins , it's neither rich nor poor ... ... it's touristy .
and if there's rubbish but no bins , then it's poor .
so this place is rich?
you bet , this is switzerland !
is this place poor?
yes , this is albania .
and here?
smell that?
the scent of happiness .
this is greece .
people don't move .
they take the time to watch us pass .
i've worked hard all my life ... ... but i've always taken my time about it .
i've never tried for record sales ... ... or a crowd of customers .
slowness ... ... that's the key to happiness .
what do you want to do later?
i don't know .
import export .
import export?
that's good .
import export .
meet my son momo ... ... who'll work one day in import export .
were you born by this sea?
no .
what's the matter?
nothing .
why aren't you speaking?
listen .
smell .
i smell incense .
orthodox .
i smell candles .
catholic .
it stinks of feet !
and your feet don't stink?
you're no better than others .
that odor reassures me .
i smell myself , i smell you .
where's your sea?
we're getting there .
i'm happy , momo .
you're here and i know what's in my koran .
don't be upset , but i keep thinking of blue road .
are you bored?
no , no .
but i think about it .
it's all i can think of .
i'll make you dance .
you?
yes , you must .
absolutely .
a man's heart is like a caged bird .
when you dance , your heart sings ... ... and then rises to heaven .
they spin around their hearts .
god is there , in their hearts .
it's like a prayer .
they lose all their bearings , that burden we call balance .
they become like torches .
they burn in a blazing fire .
my head's clear .
all my hatred ....
is that praying?
let's have some tea .
do you feel hatred too?
good evening .
good evening .
it's a hot one !
i'm french .
i don't speak turkish .
do you think i'm good looking?
you're very good looking .
will i be good looking enough to attract girls without paying?
in a few years , they'll pay for you .
it's not great for now .
of course not .
see how you go about it?
you stare as if to say , " see how good looking i am .
and so they just laugh .
i've never seen such beauty before .
for men like you and me ... ... not alain delon or marlon brando ... ... you're beautiful through women .
man was mineral , then vegetable , then animal .
then he became man .
can you imagine the distance between dust and what we are now?
later , you'll become an angel , after you finish with the earth .
when you dance , it's like that .
wait here .
i won't be long .
it's over the mountain .
go on , get out .
get out .
why?
i left so long ago , i don't know what i'll find .
what'll i do here?
speak with your smile .
i'll be back very soon .
see you , my son .
go back to your village .
i don't know where i'm going .
what about lbrahim?
where's lbrahim?
the journey ends here .
no .
yes .
i've arrived .
i didn't know .
what about the sea?
all rivers flow into the same sea .
no , momo .
i'm not pleased .
i'm scared .
i'm not scared .
i know ... ... what's in my koran .
i've had a good life .
i'm old .
i've had a wife .
she died a long time ago ...
... but i still love her .
i've returned home .
the store was doing well .
the blue road is pretty ... ... even if it isn't blue .
and then ... ... there's you .
i don't want this .
i'm not dying .
i'm going to join ... ... the immensity .
i'll read the will now .
this is my will and testament .
i , lbrahim demirdji , hereby leave all my goods to moses schmitt , my
mother , i'm in a meeting !
excuse me .
my son momo ... ... because he chose me as his father ... ... and because i've given him everything i've learned in
excuse me .
mother , listen to me , i'll call you later .
not now .
i , ibrahim demirdji , hereby leave all my goods ... ... to moses schmitt , my son momo ... ... because he chose me as his father ... ... and because i've given him everything i've learned in this life .
now you too will know what's in my koran , momo .
it's all there is to know .
now , i'm momo .
the whole street knows me .
i'm the corner arab , open from 8 a . m . to midnight ... ... even on sundays , in the grocery trade .
eight francs forty .
just a second .
you know , i'm not an arab , momo .
