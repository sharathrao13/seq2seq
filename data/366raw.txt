i've forgotten to tell you one thing ,
if i get vampire teeth , remember ,
kill me at once !
at once .
no !
no !
don't die !
don't leave me alone !
i promise , i'll be your best partner .
i'll listen to you !
i won't fight with your sister again .
wake up , please !
do you want me to tell you everything?
i really love you !
can you hear me?
i'm alive !
but i don't know what you just said .
what?
what is it?
i said ...
i am not that easy to kill .
i couldn't hear what you said .
it's just too noisy .
okay , i'll shut up !
let's take a rest now .
your cake is really delicious .
your coffin is so comfortable .
bye !
are you looking for trouble?
that kiss was okay , but you're not allowed to kiss me again .
what you said before ...
i heard everything !
is anyone home?
miss momoko , what a coincidence to see you here .
mr. prada , i've brought you some papers to sign .
and i've brought you something else .
please wait .
this is the last chance !
i'll bite her neck .
and you can choose any position you like .
pulse , or inner thigh , or an armpit .
let's bite her together , and then suck her blood .
i told you many times !
i don't suck .
okay , i'll suck her blood and put it into a jar .
i'll serve you with a glass of it , okay?
you used to serve it like that to me .
but that's all over now .
forget the past !
i'm telling you for the last time .
i won't suck blood .
i see !
you have fallen for that girl .
tell me , you think you're fit to be a vampire?
have you got what it takes to be a prince?
are you qualified to succeed the throne?
are you giving me a lecture?
try to tell her tomorrow , tell her that you're a vampire .
see if she's generous enough to give you her blood .
why are you looking at me like that?
is it urgent?
i want to tell you what i am .
don't turn your back to me .
i'll get angry .
let me be frank .
i am not a human being .
you're certainly not acting like one !
how can you talk to me like that?
i'm a vampire .
so?
look at my eyes .
cool !
where did you get those contact lens?
what are you yelling about?
see?
i want to suck your blood !
that's not the right way to suck .
suck like this .
let me go !
off !
i know what you're doing !
you want to dump me , right?
i'm a vampire !
do you want to fall in love with a vampire?
so what's a vampire?
can a vampire brush his girl off like this?
i know !
you think i'm too sassy .
but most of the girls in hong kong are sassy !
don't you believe me?
go find another one .
if you dare !
i have some dogs at home .
i don't mind having a vampire .
the only problem is that my brother may not like you !
i am a vampire , and a useless vampire , too .
what do you mean?
i haven't eaten for days !
what are you doing?
i am taking you to find food .
you stay here !
it's better for me to go alone .
be careful !
it's time to eat .
something's wrong , let's run !
did you get caught?
can you hear that?
what is it?
bats .
if there are bats around , it means vampires are around , too .
let's run !
why is the hospital alarm ringing?
has there been a robbery?
i think it's just a mistake .
i don't think any thief would be stupid enough to steal from a hospital .
who knows?
thieves are everywhere .
your car could even get stolen .
speak of the devil !
what's the matter?
who are you?
i am so glad to see you again !
i saved you last time .
would you help us now?
your friend is dying !
that's right !
i think he's dying !
he has to get to another hospital !
please take him there now .
but i have to take something to the hospital .
the " something " you have to take is him .
take him there now , or he'll die !
come on !
hurry !
let's go !
please !
are you feeling bad?
do you want to suck my blood?
of course not !
i can treat your teeth like mosquitoes !
if you don't eat , you'll die !
jackie , driver faster please .
what's up?
who are these guys?
help !
be careful !
i don't know how to drive !
hold the wheel tightly !
this is bad !
are you okay?
what the hell are you?
this is terrible !
i ran someone over !
vampires !
they are vampires !
vampires?
he can fly !
come on up !
throw me another bag of blood !
okay !
it's working !
this is type ab .
are there really vampires?
it works !
what did you give them?
it's a kind of tranquilizer .
it should calm them down .
they ate so much !
it's making them go crazy !
turn on the music now .
drink it .
come on !
i brought it for you !
do you feel better?
well ...
jackie asked me to return it to you .
what does this mean?
the ring is too tight !
i can't get it off .
good morning .
good morning !
you help my brother to iron his clothes?
i'll iron them from now on .
congratulations !
you've found someone you can love .
haven't you fallen in love with someone too?
he's great .
he's just terrific .
but sometimes , he's not that good to me ...
the harder it is to fall in love with him , the more i love the feeling !
anyway , there is something missing !
so i just couldn't fall in love .
what's missing?
that is ...
what is it?
something is missing ...
he is the " thing " you and my brother hate most .
have you fallen in love with a vampire?
but he's a good vampire !
vampires suck blood and kill people !
how can that be good?
he'd rather starve than suck blood .
he is really nice !
could you say something on our behalf?
your brother and i are vampire hunters .
please help us !
please .
i beg you to help us !
my dear sister in law !
come on !
please help me , " my dear sister in law " !
we are a family !
family !
as your sister in law , i'll help you , right?
i always said my brother is lucky !
at the first sight ,
i could tell you were really nice as well as pretty .
hey , how did you win my brother's heart?
watch this !
superstar !
can you do that?
it's terrible !
but your brother likes it .
no way !
he's got special tastes !
he likes trashy girls , but they must be simple .
besides being simple , she must be ordinary .
do you have any better suggestions?
does it work?
how about this?
can you do that again?
my dear sister in law !
do you have a date?
what do you think?
you put on perfume !
we can go now .
do you like it?
how pathetic to find a vampire living here , in a church !
now , where is the fifth prince?
this is for you .
what is it?
why is it black?
vampires wear black wedding gowns .
really?
well , you search over there , and i'll check over here .
why should i go there?
what are you doing?
let go !
don't you love me?
why did you let them go?
they're in love !
that's my sister , and that's a vampire !
what did we swear before joining the league?
when i took my oath ,
i didn't fall in love .
now , i know what love is !
once you love a person , you won't care about anything .
you can tell that from what i'm wearing .
didn't you promise you'd do anything for me?
i've got it !
i'll wait for you here !
reeve , right where you are least expected !
good to see you again , old friend .
this is my room .
this is my bed .
may i lie down?
just for sleeping?
go ahead , well , it's good to take a nap .
our beds are not just for sleeping .
see , it's bigger than yours .
are there other ways to use it?
such as?
well , chatting !
many people love chatting in bed .
haven't you ever heard of " pillow talk "?
no .
shall we try now?
sure !
why don't you talk?
what's up?
someone's here !
my dear sister in law , you're home !
come with me now !
what's up?
your brother is in trouble !
he's the only one person who can save your brother .
kazaf , how long have i waited for this moment?
i didn't come for you .
let reeve go .
you still dare to act like royalty?
bow to me , and i may grant you an easy death .
you still need my blood ,
if i spill it myself , it's worthless to you ,
let him go .
why should l?
your friends have already gone to rescue reeve .
perhaps , i should free this one instead?
reeve !
drop the knife and he shall be free .
no chance !
release him !
no ...
let him go !
reeve !
reeve !
it's me !
i'm your sister , helen !
so i see you are stronger than your brothers !
reeve !
reeve !
gypsy !
in this world , there are still some vampires .
and there are three more vampire hunters .
one of them is me .
one is my sister in law , who's now become a semi vampire .
and the other one is a sentimental vampire !
i've brought you something to eat .
come on , try some !
i really love to eat !
so , go ahead .
i've brought you some papers .
take a look , see whether you've got any questions .
i can do the amendments for you .
i think something is wrong .
what's the problem?
just tell me .
you're disgusting !
i feel so itchy !
do you always act like that?
do you always act like that?
i haven't tried that before .
honey , i told daddy that you're " dickson " ...
it should be decent .
you're " dickson
i just wanted to speak faster .
i am sorry .

no way , i have to deliver something to the hospital .

i don't know .
you can just put it here .
