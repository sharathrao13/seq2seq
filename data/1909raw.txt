shit !
shit !
shit !
hey !
stop , please !
in a related story , the high court had also refused ... to stay friday's execution of former philosophy professor david gale .
oh , boy .
gale had sought a review of his 1994 conviction ... for the rape and murder of his university of austin colleague constance harraway .
the case has received nation wide media attention because gale and harraway ... were activists for deathwatch , a nonprofit abolitionist organization .
do you understand how much money the taxpayers pay in the state of texas ... to put one person to death?
what do we want?
no more executions !
governor , can't we all just admit ... that the capital punishment system in this country is not working?
they're not gonna stay gale .
it's on tv right now .
listen .
defense lawyers had hoped to argue ... that gale's former activism against capital punishment ... unduly prejudiced the texas judicial system .
the deal was , bitsey would get the interview if the stay was refused .
he'll talk to her for two hours a day ...
tuesday , wednesday and thursday .
can't do friday , no .
'cause friday's the day they execute him .
the lawyer said only bitsey .
gale's going down .
only bitsey " means only bitsey .
i don't get to make the rules , joe .
please , i'm a fat black woman .
tell him i said ...
what we need is to put her on a plane to texas .
why do you get like that around legal?
hold on .
we're coming over .
so what's this " only bitsey means only bitsey " stuff?
they asked for you and no substitutes .
who's " they " exactly?
gale's lawyers .
more exactly , gale's lawyer ... some good ol 'boy in austin .
why do they want me?
you're telling me you don't want the assignment?
no .
i just can't see why a guy on death row about to be executed should ask for me .
i think they like the kiddie porn piece you did and going to jail and stuff .
i don't know .
maybe he saw your picture and thinks you're cute .
so how much access do i get?
three interviews .
no time for any more .
by friday , the guy's a goner .
okay .
what exactly is our story?
rape , murder , death row .
very intelligent guy .
hey , maybe he's even innocent .
yeah , right .
no , no .
tell him i'll call him back .
thanks .
okay , so what's your problem?
hi , barbara .
good morning , bitsey .
okay .
here's my concern .
setting aside the cost , although half a million dollars ... in cash , i might add ... for three days of interviews is not only illegal , it's obscene .
that's market value .
the guy's never talked .
aside from that , i ... we ... are still uncomfortable with the arrangement .
why?
you just spent a very public seven days in jail ... for a very public contempt of court citation .
for protecting sources .
if you're so goddamn uncomfortable with the story ... why did you slap it on both the domestic and the international covers?
look , what makes me ... us ... uncomfortable is the fact that a rapist slash murderer ... has asked to spend the last three days of his life giving an interview ... his very first ... to a reporter who is now famous for protecting sexual deviants ... a reporter who's also a very attractive woman .
aw , come on !
this is disparate treatment .
oh , boy .
i could go if i were an ugly guy?
there's an agenda issue here which would be defused with the presence of a man .
i hear lawyers gleefully saying the words " bloom vs.
news magazine , incorporated .
your honor , i started to notice my assignments being determined on the basis of my sex .
no .
you've gotta let her go now .
that's not quite what i meant .
he's gotta let you go .
all right , all right .
enough .
but the intern will be with you at all times .
okay .
what?
intern?
no .
you gotta be kidding .
that's what he said .
he's the boss .
he's a jerk .
come on .
not an intern .
i always work alone .
not this time , bitsey .
look , i'm not baby sitting .
gale's d. n. a. was everywhere .
his semen was inside her .
he was seen leaving her house .
his prints were all over the kitchen , including one on the bag .
half a thumb print .
okay , half a thumb print .
that's enough .
he could've touched it before it was a murder weapon .
do you fondle your friends 'garbage bags?
i get very touchy around household plastics .
i'm particularly fond of tupperware .
tupperware?
look , i'm just saying ... the bag could've been sitting up on the counter or something .
zack?
he did it .
now he's gonna die .
and you know something?
maybe that's exactly what he deserves .
but the murder's way too fuckin 'clumsy .
this guy is a major intellectual .
top of his harvard class , rhodes scholar , tenured at 27 , two books published .
he's an academic stud .
look at his wife , a regular grace kelly ... old money svelte , father was ambassador to spain .
shit .
the light's on again .
ignore it .
it's a rental .
do you smell anything?
no .
besides , the guy's a flaming liberal .
a person's politics has nothing to do ...
with his propensity to commit a crime .
wrong .
aren't we supposed to smell something if it's overheating?
seventy three percent of all serial killers vote republican .
look , throw your cigarette out so we can smell .
no .
you'll stink up the car .
throw it out .
i'm not gonna fuckin 'pollute .
zack !
there is definitely something wrong with this car .
shit .
this is so irritating .
how far to huntsville?
look .
i'm gonna pull off .
news magazine reporters bitsey bloom and zack stemmons ... enter the rest area with car troubles .
little did they know , it wasn't just their car that was in trouble .
i'm a reporter .
you're an intern .
whatever .
is it hot?
ow !
jesus !
yes .
isn't it always?
what do i do?
call the office and get the rental road service number .
no signal .
i gotta pee .
goddamn it .
zack?
zack?
zack !
yeah !
good morning .
hi .
a little early for that , isn't it?
the nonsmoking section's over there .
i meant the book .
oh .
dialogical exhaustion by david gale .
the guy's a genius .
what time is it?
9 : 15 .
there are , like , 10 prisons around here .
death row's in the ellis unit , but they're moving it to the terrell unit end of the year .
the waitress's boyfriend works there , but her last boyfriend worked in the huntsville unit .
the two before that in walker .
the estelle unit has the cutest guys .
and , i'm quoting , " my butt's too big to get an estelle guy .
ellis is 15 minutes out of town , so we've got five and a half hours .
never eat in a place where the menus have pictures of the food .
maybe we should drive into austin and check out the crime scene .
that could be some great stuff for our story , you know?
this isn't " our story .
it's not even a story .
it's an interview .
most importantly for you to remember ... it's my interview .
okay .
what do i do for the next five hours?
drive around .
look for a decent restaurant .
you know , bitsey , your reputation ... as " mike wallace with p. m. s " doesn't do you justice .
my reputation got us invited here .
i play by the rules even if my colleagues don't like it .
it's called ...
objectivity .
ambition?
so , what can i get you , ma'am?
coffee .
just coffee .
don't push me , smart ass .
you know you're in the bible belt when there are more churches than starbucks .
when there are more prisons than starbucks .
he should die , die , die .
he's ready to see y'all now .
yes , i am .
i'm listenin 'very patiently .
ma'am , i'm not gonna debate with you ... the rights and wrongs of this situation .
our job is to run the state prison system .
well , ma'am , this is not france .
this is not germany .
this is texas , and we're gonna follow texas law .
well , you're very welcome , ma'am .
good bye now .
thank you , margie .
correspondents bloom and stevens , i presume .
yes .
hello .
stemmons .
stemmons .
sorry .
won't happen again .
i'm duke grover , t. d. c. j. community relations .
he's usually real good with names .
and these days , i always like to ask , do you prefer miss , mrs. or ms.?
bitsey .
bitsey it is .
margie , i'm stealin 'your guests .
okeydokey .
bitsey , you ever been in a prison?
yes .
on death row?
no .
i. d. 's again , please .
all executions in the state of texas ... occur over at our huntsville unit downtown ... but death row is here for the time being .
this is home to all 442 offenders prior to their date .
average stay on row is nine years .
now , some get commuted , but most get put to death .
earl .
it'll put you off your supper ,
but , then , it's supposed to .
carla , new york guests for mr. gale .
can i get your bags?
we have three concerns here ...
safety , safety and safety .
visitation area's entirely secure .
we just ask that you don't touch the glass .
windex gets expensive .
oh , hey .
you're not carrying a weapon , are you , bitsey?
bitsey?
sorry .
no .
mr. stemmons , you packin '?
no , sir .
cell phone?
they're not working .
no service .
then you won't mind leaving them here .
we also have rules against the carryin 'of large sums of cash ...
thank you .
and the wearin 'of open toed shoes .
those will do just fine .
you want to step on through now?
there you go .
mm hmm .
thank you , ma'am .
that's fine .
open toed shoes?
drives 'em crazy .
your turn , mr. stemmons .
right on through there .
good , good .
now , should anything unpleasant occur in the visitation area ... we ask you to stay put .
and please , follow the instructions of our fine correctional officers ... should they see fit to give you any .
bobby .
now , anything you say can be overheard ... and any discussion of criminal activity on your part is admissible .
you're not plannin 'on a jailbreak now , are you , bitsey?
uh , no .
well , rain seems to be holdin 'off .
you watch your step here , bitsey girl .
this cement can get pretty slippery .
this is our japanese garden .
now , we ask you not to throw coins in the pond .
right this way .
almost there .
here we are .
this is our visitation area right here .
all yours , mr. belyeu .
well , that's it for me .
you folks have a safe visit .
bye now .
thank you .
ms. bloom?
come right on in here and make yourself comfortable .
yes .
did that p. r. man validate your parkin '?
he said the gift shop would do it .
she's a smart one .
braxton belyeu , mr. gale's attorney .
this is zack stemmons .
my good pleasure .
and right over here , we have the man of the hour .
hello .
hello .
hi .
sit down , gale .
prisoner will not stand .
now , why can't they turn that thing down?
my lawyer respectfully requests that you adjust the volume on the speaker system .
gale .
sit down .
they're practicing being cruel and unusual .
well , ms. bloom , i'm sure you're bitin 'at the bit .
it is our understanding that you are to have three two hour sessions ...
today , tomorrow and thursday .
mm hmm .
all at 3 : 00 in the p . m .
i'm sorry we can't afford you more time ... but , contrary to popular rumor ... we have not yet begun to fight .
it is our understanding that you will do this alone .
the magazine would prefer that i'm here .
alone .
understood .
it's also our understanding that you will use no recording equipment of any kind .
correct .
excellent .
now , i have a few papers for which i need your jo ann hancock .
so if you'd be kind enough to stop by my austin office at your earliest convenience .
thursday mornin ', say?
expenses and so forth .
fine .
till thursday then .
good luck , ms. bloom .
i'll stop by later .
mr. zack , what say you and me partake of a death defyin 'cigarette ... in the visitors 'parking lot?
bye bye , y'all .
so .
please pull up a seat .
he's quite a character .
yes .
he's about the only outside contact i have now .
and a good friend .
where's your ex wife?
i don't want you to ask me questions about her or my son .
what i offer you is one thing , but questions about them are not part of our deal .
okay .
anything else , just say " off the record .
i'll take it to my grave .
you can trust me on that .
does this count as recording equipment?
how do we start?
we start with ... you telling me what i'm doing here .
no one who looks through that glass sees a person .
they see a crime .
i'm not david gale .
i'm a murderer and a rapist ... four days shy of his execution .
you're here because i wanna be remembered as much for how i led my life ... and the decisions that i made as for how my life ended .
why me?
why not?
you spent some time behind bars yourself recently .
i certainly have .
because you do take things to your grave .
protecting sources , even kiddie porn scum , is the magazine policy ... and mine .
i know .
that's your reputation .
well , i have a hard story for you to tell , ms. bloom .
it's not going to be easy .
so where do we begin?
well , i suppose i should tell you how i became the head of philosophy ... at the university of austin .
come on .
think .
i want you to reach back into those minds and tell me , tell us all ...
what is it that you fantasize about?
world peace?
i thought so .
do you fantasize about international fame?
do you fantasize about winning a pulitzer prize?
or a nobel peace prize?
an mtv music award?
do you fantasize about meeting some genius hunk , ostensibly bad ... but secretly simmering with noble passion ...
and willing to sleep on the wet spot?
i'll take two !
i'll take two !
what was that?
kimberly will take two .
you get lacan's point .
fantasies have to be unrealistic ... because the moment ... the second ... that you get what you seek ... you don't ... you can't want it anymore .
in order to continue to exist ... desire must have its objects perpetually absent .
it's not the " it " that you want .
it's the fantasy of" it .
so , desire supports crazy fantasies .
sorry .
this is what pascal means when he says that we are only truly happy ... when daydreaming about future happiness .
it came today .
or why we say ... the hunt is sweeter than the kill .
or be careful what you wish for , not because you'll get it ... but because you're doomed not to want it once you do .
so the lesson of lacan is , living by your wants will never make you happy .
what it means to be fully human is to strive to live by ideas and ideals ... and not to measure your life by what you've attained in terms of your desires ... but those small moments of integrity , compassion ... rationality , even self sacrifice .
because in the end , the only way that we can measure the significance of our own lives ... is by valuing the lives of others .
all right .
i'll see you all on monday .
sorry about being late .
there was , you know , a thing .
yeah , there usually is , berlin .
look , i know that i'm not doin 'too well .
and to torture a clich ...
i would do anything to pass .
anything , huh?
any ... thing .
okay , berlin .
i will give you a good grade ...
i will give you a very , very good grade ... if you would just ... study .
hey .
hey .
the t. a. finished transcribing all the governor's radio and tv comments .
listen to this gem .
governor , don't you think three executions in one week is excessive?
'i say , bring'em in , strap'em down and let's rock and roll . " '
it's good to hear that our governor's in touch with his inner frat boy .
tell me again why you're not doing this debate .
telegenics .
you have a cuter butt .
oh , i hadn't noticed .
i know .
no .
i didn't mean that .
i've highlighted stuff .
he'll do the whole " down home wisdom " thing ... capital punishment is god's law , an eye for an eye .
stick to arguments about rational facts .
and watch your ego .
don't come across as one of those " i hate authority ...
'cause everyone around here wears big hats and nobody in charge reads the new yorker .
anything else?
i'm getting new federal stats from amnesty tonight .
well , bring them by greer's party .
i have papers to grade .
and if you have a hangover tomorrow ...
i'm walkin 'away .
10 : 00 !
bright eyed and bushy tailed .
bushy tailed .
hey , jamie .
did you mark your calendar yet?
yep , i sure did .
one , two , three , four more days until mom comes home .
only four more days?
that's great news .
can i ask you something?
it's really , really important .
of course you can .
can we have pancakes for breakfast?
okay .
with syrup and strawberries?
well , we'll have to see .
and chocolate shavers?
no , no .
it's chocolate shavings .
and whipped cream?
whipped cream?
that's a lot of requests for one little boy .
why don't you go to sleep?
do cloud dog too .
okay .
good night , cloud dog .
there you go .
you go to sleep .
good night .
don't forget to feed the fish .
what?
don't forget to feed the fish .
okay .
jo edna , i'll be back before midnight .
here's the phone number to reach me .
there's chicken and stuff in the refrigerator if you want some .
that's fine , mr. gale .
maybe i'll fix myself something later .
bye .
bye .
dad , did you feed the fish?
yes , i did .
now go to sleep .
give me back my broken night
my mirrored room my secret life
he's the immanuel kant of the nfl .
he's consistent , he's accurate , he's effective .
and let's not forget ... boring .
he is boring .
if you want boring , read william bennett's the book of virtues .
i'm still asleep .
someone wake me up .
professor gale .
where's your better half?
john , how are you?
better half?
oh , my wife .
um , she's in spain .
again?
i am sorry .
john , have you seen alma?
she's been looking for you .
so my wife's affair is just this big open secret .
uh , hermeneutical bias .
the only fun truths are the ones someone's trying to hide .
she's been to barcelona four times this year .
i don't think she's trying to hide anything .
well , her father is the ambassador .
yeah , except the embassy's in madrid .
ah .
oh , by the way , berlin's here ... and , uh , pretty livid .
why?
we've expelled her .
she got the letter today and took the opportunity to throw a little fit in my office .
talkin 'about me?
why , yes , as a matter of fact , we were .
did he tell you that i said , when you were circumcised ... they threw away the wrong part?
yes .
i believe he mentioned it .
it's called schmuck .
what?
the part of the foreskin they throw away ... after circumcision , i think it's called schmuck .
aren't we so fucking clever?
i think perhaps i shall get another .
david?
black bush .
you were a jerk this afternoon .
well , for what it's worth , i didn't know about the expulsion till just now .
is that supposed to be an apology?
no .
it's more like a ... conciliation .
i call you on the phone
every night about this time
ross . !
ross . !
ross . !
ross . !
all right , all right .
all right .
as the poets have mournfully sung ... death takes the innocent young ...
the screamingly funny , the rolling in money ,
and those who are very well hung .
gale !
gale !
gale !
gale !
gale !
gale !
gale !
gale !
there once was a lesbian from cancun ...
oh , get dirty !
who took a young man up to her room ... where they argued all night as to who had the right ... to do what and how much and to whom .
enough .
enough .
ross !
ross !
i'm spent .
i have no more . !
okay .
i'm finished .
i'm done .
i'm not a student anymore .
i do not think i wanna know what that means .
there once was a girl named berlin ... who liked a bit now and again .
not now and again , but now ...
and again ... and again .
cute , huh?
oh , yeah .
very cute .
i have a secret ... but i have to come over there to tell you .
oh , no , no , no , no .
no .
you s ...
here ...
no .
no .
i come .
you stay back .
woman , you should ...
you should ...
you should stay ...
i wasn't after the grade .
look , i don't think this is ... is such a ...
shh .
now , we can talk , analyze ... contemplate .
or you can put your mouth on my body .
don't reject me .
please .
rip them .
what?
rip them off .
rollin 'down a mountain slowin 'down so fast that i could smell the brakes
i got scared away
no .
from behind .
from behind .
do it hard .
harder .
bite my shoulder .
aw . !
thanks for comin 'more . !
more . !
all right , you guys , it's time to go home .
get outta here .
it's not gonna work .
that's a faulty argument .
let's say we found an innocent on death row .
what would change?
after the retrial , the governor would simply go on tv ... and say , " see?
thanks to the good people at deathwatch , the system works .
sure , if we had absolute proof that he had executed an innocent ... we could demand a moratorium , like in illinois .
are you okay?
sorry .
yeah .
but that won't happen .
the dead men can't make a case ...
and almost martyrs don't count .
got it .
so , keep it rational .
and stop that .
mm hmm .
what?
active listening .
i hate active listeners .
i feel like they're too busy pretending to listen to actually hear what i'm saying .
i can listen and actively listen at the same time .
i'm good at that .
did you bring the amnesty stats?
yes .
no .
oh !
i left them at home .
i have a copy .
you want to tell me what's up?
nothing .
everything .
something profoundly stupid happened last night .
i hope you used a condom .
oh .
jesus christ , david .
was she one of yours?
it was berlin .
oh , great !
oh , that's great .
i can hear the grapevine now .
they had to suspend her so that gale could dick her with a clear conscience .
a power differential equals coercion .
that is great .
you're so weak .
you're not my wife , constance .
thank god .
well , don't worry .
it's not a position i aspire to , so fuck you .
i didn't mean it that way .
are you okay?
let's go .
yes !
really?
yes .
let's go .
there are 17, 000 murders a year in the united states .
ten of the 12 states that have abolished the death penalty ... they have a murder rate that's lower than the national average .
and if he starts with the religious stuff , just say that ... nearly every denomination in the united states opposes the death penalty .
are you listening?
okay .
yes .
all right .
ten seconds , everybody .
roll tape , please .
count 'em in , mack .
here we go .
five , four ...
welcome back to batter's box .
we continue our very special four part program ... with governor hardin , and arguing capital punishment with him ... is deathwatch regional codirector , professor david gale .
you are up , governor .
you know , alan , i always say the same thing ... and i'm gonna keep on sayin 'it ...
i hate killin '... and my administration will kill to stop it .
how about it?
murderers are not deterred by the thought of execution .
they're just not , and you know it .
every single study that's been done on this subject ... and there's been over 200 ... and you've read them ... has reached the same conclusion .
they all say the same thing .
well , maybe you should read your bible .
deuteronomy 19 : 21 .
an eye for an eye , tooth for a tooth .
what did gandhi say about that?
the old law of an eye for an eye leaves us all blind .
well , i'm sorry ... and with respect ... that's fuzzy liberal thinking .
you really believe that , governor?
of course .
that's interesting .
'cause you said that yourself in a speech in your first campaign .
he got ...
he got you there , governor .
how about it?
yes , he did .
yes , he did .
if you're not a liberal at 30 , you've got no heart .
and if you're still a liberal at 40 , you've got no brain .
that's winston churchill .
touch .
so what you're essentially saying and what you feel is ... and this is to choose another quote ...
that a healthy society ... must stop at nothing to cleanse itself of evil .
uh , yes .
uh ...
i'd have to agree .
did i say that too?
oh , no , sir .
that was hitler .
ooh .
oh !
can't we just admit that the capital punishment system in this country is not working?
we are condemning people to death based on phony expert testimony ... on junk science , on on jail house snitches ...
alan , did you know that texas has the highest per capita incarceration rate in the world?
forty three people that you executed ...
alan , could i ... were represented by lawyers who were at one time disbarred or sanctioned .
there are two men on death row right now , on this day ...
whose lawyers fell asleep during cross examination .
i'm not a lawyer .
and the texas court of criminal appeals ruled that that was not ... that was not a basis for a retrial .
governor , that's just a flawed , insane , crazy system .
and a flawed system will kill innocent men .
okay , all right .
let him answer .
all right , mr. gale , we'll play your game .
name one .
name one innocent man that texas has put to death during my tenure ... of the hundred or so executions ...
it's 131 , governor , in case you lost count .
let him finish .
fine .
thank you .
whatever .
just give me a name ...
i'm gonna write it down ... a man that you can prove was innocent ...
there you go .
and i'll call a moratorium .
mr. gale .
are we through here , alan?
you know what?
we're running out of time .
i'd like to thank my guests , governor hardin and professor david gale from deathwatch .
roll credits .
thank you for joining me today .
hope you will join me tomorrow .
your exact words were ...
just tell me when my ego's getting in the way of the work .
i'm telling you , your ego's getting in the way of the work .
i didn't wanna do this in the first place .
you put up two seconds of protest at the thought of being on a televised debate .
what does that mean?
it means that deathwatch suffers because ... you're so anxious to finger authority , to publicly prove that david gale ... is so much fucking smarter than the powers that be !
learn to work without an audience .
try squeezing money from the donor list .
have you licked one single mail out envelope?
mr. gale?
hey , guys , the governor went that way .
ramirez ...
austin police .
this is officer hasermann .
what , is debating the governor a crime now?
no , sir .
rape is .
berlin had my bite marks .
gale !
time's up .
bruises .
her clothes were ripped .
my skin was found under her fingernails .
i mean , it didn't look like anything but rape .
then she drops the charges ... and leaves town , making it look like i was guilty ... and she was too traumatized to face a trial .
my wife had to read all about this while she was sitting in the airport ... wondering where i was , why i wasn't there to pick her up .
it took me almost two weeks to get bailed out .
and the grad student berlin?
why do you think she did it?
poke her finger at authority , show the powers that be how much smarter she was .
grad student's revenge .
i don't really know .
do you know where i can find her?
no .
first year i was in here , i got a postcard from san francisco .
it was signed , " from the student who would do anything .
did she say anything else?
i'm sorrier than you can know .
move it , gale .
i'm running out of time .
can you imagine his wife letting him stew in jail for two weeks?
who can blame her?
we'll get an address for the berlin girl from the university .
you still don't think he's telling the truth .
on the berlin rap?
on the whole rap .
who knows?
anyway , there is no truth , only perspectives .
if you say there's no truth , you're claiming it's true there's no truth .
it's a logical contradiction .
working on our philosophy merit badge , are we?
when it comes to rape , an accusation's as good as a conviction .
it sticks like shit .
that's an appetizing metaphor .
technically , a simile .
i think he's telling the truth .
this you know from sitting in a prison lobby?
it's just my perspective .
three different courts found him guilty , zack .
that's enough perspective for me .
okay , okay , okay .
1 33 0 what?
seven .
thirty three ... oh three .
3305 .
3307 .
right there .
geez .
look at the sign .
the stranger in your life  hi .
i'm bitsey bloom .
this is zack stemmons .
we're ...
uh , yeah .
you want the tour?
there's a $20 mandatory donation ... apiece .
but you get a reenactment photo pack , and it's got five pictures .
okay .
i gotta collect first .
oh , sure .
i got it .
go sign the book .
it doesn't have to be your real name though .
the first page just says you're here to do research on violent crime .
the state requires it for nonprofit shit .
take a reenactment photo pack .
uh , if you guys could share one , it'd be really cool ...
'cause the fuckers that do my prints jerk my chain .
that's me .
my boyfriend took it .
we also got a video .
it's 50 bucks 'cause you can see my tits .
there's a version without tits .
it's 35 .
do many people take the tour?
not so much anymore .
we thought this'd be , like , a busy week with gale getting the prune juice and all .
so you ... you don't mind living here?
it's better than livin 'with my dick wad parents .
it starts over here .
she let him crash here sometimes .
he was , like , constantly wasted .
exhibit one .
he drank scotch religiously .
the rest is in the kitchen .
here's number two .
this is where the tripod was .
my boyfriend borrowed the one we usually show to folks .
they never found a camera or photos or video or anything .
gale must have buried them .
these serial killer dudes take photos to whack off to later .
he he's not exactly a serial killer .
whatever .
she was , like , totally naked right here .
the meter man saw her through the door .
gale handcuffed her , taped her mouth ... and then taped a bag over her head so she couldn't breathe .
he used those housewife gloves so he wouldn't leave prints .
they found sticky stuff from the tape on them .
uh !
we ask folks not to touch the exhibit .
right .
totally sick part is where they found the key to the handcuffs .
yeah .
we know .
wait .
what?
where was it?
it was in her stomach , dude .
gale made her swallow it before he bagged her .
that's pretty much the highlights .
got questions?
i can still smell the cigarette smoke .
it's the barbecue .
can you imagine?
the key was in her stomach .
that's so fucking cold , man .
zack?
what?
isn't that the cowboy from the rest area?
the same truck .
weird coincidence , huh?
well , coincidences are always weird .
that's why they are coincidences .
off the record .
okay .
we're off .
constance was murdered ... by what's known as the securitat method .
you're handcuffed , forced to swallow the key . is sealed around your head ... and you're left there to suffocate .
the securitat did it to romanians when they wouldn't inform or confess .
sometimes the bag was ripped off your head at the last moment to give you a second chance .
otherwise , you died knowing that the key to your freedom ... was inside of you the entire time .
it's a cheap but effective method .
the problem is ...
i once mentioned it in an article that i wrote .
prosecution never knew that .
someone's framing you?
oh , it's more than that .
there was a tripod .
right .
facing her body .
we back on the record?
yes .
the tripod had no fingerprints on it .
that means that somebody brought it there ... set it up , wiped it clean and left it .
why?
it's as if they wanted me to know that somewhere out there ... is a record of exactly what happened that afternoon ... as if they wanted me to die knowing that the key to my freedom ... is out there somewhere .
maybe you're being paranoid .
miss bloom , i used to be the state's leading death penalty abolitionist ... and now i'm on death row .
doesn't that strike you as a little odd?
any idea who " they " are?
no , but i've got someone working on that ... someone i'm relying on to prove my innocence .
belyeu's hired a detective?
a journalist .
she has to help me .
you know i'm innocent .
no .
no , i don't .
wear me like a fur , daddy .
wear me like a fur .
okay .
who's your hero?
who's your ...
ow !
ow !
you go get cloud dog .
hey !
cloud dog !
call me when you land .
has any couple ever survived a trial separation?
don't .
isn't separating contrary to the whole idea of trying to work things out?
don't .
boo !
jamie , get in , sweetie .
see ya later , alligator .
after a while , crocodile .
take it easy , " japaneesee .
okeydokey , " artichokee .
scoot .
listen ...
i sent you an e mail .
an e mail .
just read it .
jamie .
come on , sweetie .
just read it .
you could at least hide the bottle .
well?
officially , you're on sabbatical .
unofficially , they want you out of here .
it was 4 2 .
how did ross vote?
i'm not supposed to dis ...
against you .
and you?
for you ... and against my politics .
yes .
mada ...
no .
m ...
please , please .
madam .
atenc ...
atencin . !
attenzione . !
uh , i am ...
my name is david gale .
i have phoned before .
yes?
yes?
can ...
no .
uh ...
por favor .
what?
no , never mind .
can you please get sharon gale?
ah . !
seora gale .
ah !
yes .
miss gale .
yes .
hello?
hello?
so i ...
i wanted to hear your feedback on the idea .
look , professor gale , i could sit here ... as i'm sure others have ... and plead departmental cutbacks , claim you need more publications ...
i need a minority ... whatever .
all bull geschichte .
your record's brilliant .
you're an original voice , worth in today's ...
scarcity defines value capitalist system under which we toil ... " your weight in gold .
hell , it's ...
it's not even your alcohol problem .
it'd be nice to have a faculty member whose crutch wasn't prozac .
but to speak plain , if i were to hire you ... in the eyes of the regents , the alumni and every freshman with an ear for gossip ...
i'd be hiring a rapist .
those charges were dropped .
people would say you had a good lawyer .
i was innocent .
you don't get it , do you?
you're not politically correct , dr. gale .
welcome to the club .
socrates is ... is sentenced to death .
socrates is sentenced to death .
i bet you didn't know that .
he was sentenced to death .
but athenian law ...
athenian law let the condemned ...
come up with their own alternate punishment .
isn't that a great idea?
so where are the athenians when you really need 'em?
so anyway , socrates ...
and he was ugly .
did i mention that?
did i mention that socrates was ugly?
he was ugly .
socrates was ugly , plato was fat ... and , uh , and aristotle was a prissy dresser .
so anyway , socrates comes up with this idea .
he says ...
he says , " well , what if i pay a fine instead of death?
he suggests a fine .
all he has to do in order to live ... is to come up with an appropriately punitive figure .
punitive figure .
guess what he suggested?
thirty bucks .
thirty bucks?
does that make any sense?
thirty bucks .
that's 30 mina .
that was the currency of the day ... a mina .
well , it's minae .
minae .
that's the plural .
minae .
thirty bucks !
thirty pieces of silver .
and the judges are so pissed that more of them voted to kill him ... than had voted him guilty in the first place .
that just doesn't make any sense .
thirty pieces of silver .
just like the judas guy , the jesus kisser ... who was also a prissy dresser .
without a successful completion of an alcohol treatment program ... you can forget visitation .
you'll be lucky to get a christmas card .
that's if there even is a custody hearing .
what does that mean?
if your wife convinces a spanish court ... that you're a danger to the child , then you'll never see him again .
he just has to come home .
he's gotta come back .
hey , pete , can we have another round here .
i'm fine .
i just have to go get him then .
europe's not mexico , david .
they got real borders over there .
you might be able to get yourself in easy enough ... but getting out with a six year old ...
that's a whole different kettle of crawdads .
then you get your life together .
i'm fine .
i'm fine .
pronto .
who wants to start?
hi .
my name is david , and ...
i am an alcoholic .
hi , david .
so , mr. gale ... tell me three personal qualities ... that you feel you have ... that would make you a successful radio shed manager .
three .
three .
okay .
well ...
no , i'm sorry .
i'm ...
oh , i'm sorry .
welcome back .
thanks .
you look good .
i feel good .
look , there's somethin 'that you gotta see .
betty sue johnson's been rescheduled .
her execution date is set for the eighth .
i have a conference call with washington tonight .
if the new national director will commit to emergency funds ...
so betty sue gets commuted , and you only prove the system works .
but i'll save a life .
hey , where'd you get that bruise?
oh , just ... doin 'chores .
is your cowboy gettin 'rough with you?
ha ha .
oh , there he is .
hey , dusty ... does she ever invite you overand not put you to work?
hey , david .
all right .
tell me her story .
she was sentenced at 17 .
i really wanna get behind this one .
she's so articulate .
who did she kill?
she'll put a face on the death penalty .
constance , who did she kill?
a cop .
oh , you're crazy .
not just your medium range " thinks she's roosevelt's bathrobe , " but i mean stark raving , screws loose , in the belfry insane .
seventeen ... four years before she could legally drink a beer .
but she killed a cop , constance .
are you gonna help?
of course .
oh .
you're burnin 'up .
jo edna .
hi , mr. gale .
how are you , jo edna?
it's good to see ...
caffeine jolt .
we deliver .
howdy , david .
howdy , folks .
oh , my , this is service .
thank you .
gladly .
latte on the left there for you , josh .
mocha .
ooh , thanks .
she's on the phone to washington .
the new national director .
uh huh .
that's right .
i'm sure we can get some pulpit time .
maybe some cable .
cable's good .
listen , i need to run .
for now , i agree the first press release should focus on the woman's youth .
i'll have the washington people look into counsel competency ... though i'm almost sure she's exhausted this on appeal .
let's see what kind of resources these ...
uh ...
john , david's gonna go ...
oh , i almost forgot .
gale's not around , is he?
no .
good .
keep it that way .
his relationship with deathwatch is over .
last thing we need is this rape thing coming back ...
john .
to bite us on the butt , and these guys don't stay on the wagon for very long .
john .
i'm serious , constance .
ban him from the premises .
i realize the two of you both ...
david !
sharon , pick up the phone .
i'm begging you . !
he's my son , all right?
he's my son too , and i wanna talk to him .
you've not let ...
hello?
jamie?
jamie , is that you?
hey .
hey , little moose .
how are you?
i miss you so much .
it's daddy .
yeah .
hello .
don't ...
jamie , wait .
wait , wait .
don't hang up the phone .
goddamn it !
damn !
god ... damn it !
ow !
fuck !
oh , you scared me .
my sheep needs a manager ... a manger .
my sheep needs a manger .
are you okay?
i fell off the wagon and i hurt myself .
come on .
come on inside .
do you know why saint jude is the patron saint of lost causes?
'cause his real name was judas .
judas .
there were two judases ...
judas , who was the saint guy , and then the other one ...
judas , who was the bad one .
he's the one that ratted out jesus and tried to kiss him .
in medieval times , they would never pray to the good judas ... for fear of getting the bad judas on the line just by mistake .
ergo , they never really gave him business unless absolutely desperate .
that's why ...
and then they changed his name .
your mail is blowing .
constance .
hey !
hey !
hey !
oh , shit !
are you the doctor?
what's wrong with her?
yes .
she's gonna be fine .
how do you know?
you haven't looked at her .
just calm down .
she just collapsed .
she was opening her mail and just fell .
please have a seat in the waiting room .
i don't know what's wrong .
please .
is there a doctor ...
she's gonna be fine .
wait here .
professor !
i have to go with her .
you wanna get arrested again?
how do you know who i am?
i watch the news .
now go wait .
ah !
how are we doing?
fine .
how's constance?
sleeping .
mr. gale , a leukemia patient's condition ...
is highly susceptible to external stress .
what?
what?
constance's illness requires a degree of regularity .
constance has leukemia?
you didn't know?
wait .
wait .
no , i didn't .
it's funny how selfish we can be , isn't it?
when i first heard constance was dying , i was so mad at her .
i thought , " how can you do this to me?
you know how hard it is for me to need other people .
why hadn't she told you?
she said she was too busy .
i guess , since death was chasing her ... she just wanted to help other people avoid it .
that's what she did with her life .
constance ...
left this world a better place than she found it .
