don't wory max, there is someone special out there for you
what do they think , i'm not trying?
you know henry?
i don't think she exists .
and the truth is , if i did find her , i don't think i'd know to do it anyway .
max , will you stop beating yourself?
i don't know how to date .
what is " datlng "?
i mean , look at those two .
even that guy has a girlfriend .
i'm such a shmug .
the last thing you need right now is a girlfriend
some chick missing with your head , going so cool with you .
pretty soon , she starts pulling the same crap all women do .
so they think its thier mission to change us ,
even though they'r the ones that screwed up .
you know , like they'r all dressing " oh, sexy " to get your attention . but then you follow one of them from apart ,
and she slaps a restraining order on you .
you kidnapped your dog .
that's not the point .
the point is ....
before you know it , she'd been ... nagging you into submission , and keepin you on a leech . .. so you'r away from your friends . you know what the best part of a blowjob is?
ten minutes of silence .
no man understands women ...
it's like we genetically programmed , to think differently .
never mind . we have bigger problems .
jonas has invited president chumly , to watch his test for replicator today .
oh , why he wants to do something stupid like that for?
genetics conference is live in a week away , we're on the replicator work , ..
so jonas is losing his mind
hey , felix .
oh , jesus . what caught up your ass? just look at yourselves , we're presenting our work to the president of the univercity , and you look like you just got out of your bed .
i did just got out of bed .
i'm very tired , see , having spending a hundred hours a week in the lap ... for the last six months to make sure my work is ready
what you've been up to?
he's been busy kissing jonas's ass .
ha , ha , ha .
we're gonna be late .
why? why he , you see , like that?
ah . hmm
now take a good look , sir , because you wont believe your eyes , otherwise .
it's true . what dr. fromer done here , is absolutely amazing .
felix?
mm hm?
if you feel comfortable removing your nose , face and head , from jonas's ass , henry can use some help with that .
at least one of us gives dr. fromer the respecthe deserves .
oh , that what it is? don't make me ...
don't do !
oh , that is so abnoxious !
a single drop of her blood contains all the genetic lnformation we need .
we simply put it into the replicator , where it will combine with a special hormon growth solution that , i have developed .
okay , let's get to it .
yes .
okay .
this better work .
now president chumly , a simple drop of blood
or strand of hair , contains all the genetic lnformation we need . then , with the hyper replicator we can circumventing normal stages of development , and instantly create a full grown adult clone .
here is the original . and here is fluffy .
fluffy two .
am hm , fluffy two .
oh , fantastic work , jonas .
i was getting a little worried , when i fought so hard to get the international genetics conference here ,
that you gonna let me down .
but now , the world will be stunned . ... when we present this .
you'll make springdale univercity famous .
you do better than that , you will make it super famous .
i could not have done that without your support , sir .
if they could have done it .
i'm going to lunch with the trust eve .
why don't you join me?
i'll be delighted , sir .
thank you .
i'll be right there , just give me a minute with my staff . super .
i want a full biological review done ...
on that rodent . cellular morphology growth rate , brain wave function ,
sexual viabiltiy everything .
a full biological?
well look , she is fine .
as you may recall , we've done that with the last fluffy two
untill she mysteriously ... imploded .
we need to present a perfect clone to the conference next week
and if we don't ,
well you can forget about that associate professorship .
been here for years .
i practically developed the hyper replicator , you know that .
jonas said he'd make me associate professor , if i stuck fine ,
henry have stuck?
oh , i have stuck .
you stuck .
if you do this ...
i deserve a promotion .
and you will get it .
but there is no way he can deny you ,
after this presentation . if every thing goes all right .
will you even buy attention in there?
we can make enough hamsters , to feed every starving kid in thailand .
can't feed hamsters to children .
henry , any number of things can go wrong .
i mean , he is rush to a senator's conference
i don't have time for a proper biological ...
do not focus on that lap .
you need to chill out ..
go out and find some hot chick to jack your penis into oh , that't brilliant , that's what i need .
yes  that's not what i need , what i need is
you have chosen wisely , my son .
no , no , no . no
henry , end badly . always is badly , everyone single time
god , she is just stunning . yes !
what could i possibly have in common with that woman?
molecular cell blology
oh , god .
you might just not hang out with your balls raw 'cause you are not obviously man anymore ,
she is out my league , henry .
girls like that date pro athletes or rock stars
what are you talking about , " rock star "?
i'm just being a realistic man .
i'm a lab assistant .
this is nothing girls find exciting . ever .
excuse me . hi .
didn't i see you in dr. fromer's lab this afternoon?
yes .
yeah . yes .
i am a huge fan of genetics .
oh , i'm sorry . you guys probably get that all the time .
not as much as you think .
well , i'm kate carson , and i'm doing a piece on genetics for modern science of magazine .
i interview
dr. fromer this morning about the hyper replicator .
well , today is your lucky day .
because , max here knows everything about the replicator .
i'm sure he can fill you in .
that would be wonderfull .
and this is a clone?
no , this is just a beta test .
ther have been a few kinks .
well , she looks healthy to me .
you
how long you'v been doing this?
since i was five . did you watch " scooby doo " when you were a little?
ofcourse i did .
okay .
remember the one with the rich , handsome , oil tycoon
ask velma out on a date , and she curiously peggerously declines? vaguely .
same episode , shaggy gets cloned .
and ever since i saw that , i've been hooked .
i had to be the guy that , making cloning a reality .
and with this technology , kate , the possibilities are endless .
i mean , we can save endangered species from becoming extinct ... we can grow human organs for transplants ,
we might be able to cure cancer .
i love genetics . i always have .
and i think i can make the world a better place .
i know exactly what you mean .
i mean , i've wanted to be a journalist
since i was a kid .
and i always thought i can get
ouch ! he bit me !
fluffy !
oh , my god is she okay? she is a little dizzy , but she is fine . how is your finger?
it's fine .
it's just a little blood .
i think i'm gonna need a bandage .
i've got some in the first workstation , second drawer .
ok . are you gonna be okay?
oh , i'll be fine .
i , just had a little problem with blood .
but i'm sorry , i should've warned you about fluffy , that fluffy is sort of adjusting to being alive .
please don't even wory about that . it's fine .
are you sure you gonna be okay?
yeah , i'll be fine .
oh , god , is that clock right?
i'm late .
i should've been on my way to airport ten minutes ago .
derek's gonna kill me .
derek? your brother derek?
no , he is my boyfriend .
oh , there is .
he is a professional athlete , isn't he?
no . don't be redicilous .
he is a rock star . hi .

you turn on next to europ and i'm tagging along .
honey , listen i'm so sorry i'm late .
that's kool baby i'm not gonna leave without the lead guitarist .
max , thanks for everything .
and meeting you was inspiration .
lnspiration? the guy is a toad .

sequence complete
oh , whoa .
no responding . what is this?
it was a dream !
it was only a dream .
a dream on my head on the floor of the lap .
don't be scared . it's okay .

jill is pretty trendy .
kate ! kate ! kate !
ah uh , no .
kate , kate , kate , kate !
ah no !
no , don't touch that .
no ! that's breakable .
kate it is .

do not eat the hamsters !
do not eat the hamsters !
give me that . okay?
stop it ! stop it !
let's go !
we have to go
and then we can get you food !
go out of the window . okay?
just go right out of the window . ae h , ae h
uh .
no , no , no , this window is bad .
look, look, look . you see?
pick yourself up and just
whoa !
morning , sir .
well , well , well , i see you finally showing , the kind of dedication i expect .
well , you'll be glad to hear , that the replikator is working perfectly .
i'm just dog tired ,
so i'm gonna get some sleep . i'll see ya .
oh ! no , no !
oh , oh , oh
oh , dear . kate ! kate !
do not eat the hamster !
yep , i love college .
what's up?
oh , thank god . thank god that you are here !
this better be important .
it's 7 : 00 am, me wouldn't even be up yet . it's important . i had a little accident at the lab last night .
did you break the replicator?
did you sell fluffy this time?
remember kate? the modern science goddess from yesterday?
i cloned her .
oh , yeah . ha, ha . very funny , man .
ae h , you ain't even a reporter
or you'r just some old friendi rott in to put in this lime gag?
i'll tell you , when it comes to jokes , you are crap .
henry !
oh , shit .
i still don't believe it , a human clone .
you made a fully grown biologically correct , extremely sexy human clone , max !
really illegal , henry !
we'll go to jail . we'r so screwd !
what , we screwd?
fuck that .
henry ! i'm talking about the clone and i.
i can use some help here buddy , please .
hm
yeah, sure . you ain't have to ask .
right .
first of all , we must make sure .. that no one finds out .
she can't be a clone , unless there is an original , and the original is in europe , right?
hatchom !
so all we gonna do is teaching her , to behave like a normal person .
unless , ofcourse she is a total morron .
no , she is not a total morron .
she just hasn't that time to simulate yet .
her brain is perfect !
it's like a sponge .
she can learn in a day what could normally take years .
she's a blank slate right now !
so .. we could program her .
she is not a vcr, henry, we're talking about .
we can make a woman ,
who likes sports .. and action movies and hanging out in the bars and not cats , or winecollars or fool play .
you mean, make a woman ,
who acts exactly like a man .
exactly . the perfect woman .
a woman, that man can actually understand .
what did you do that for?
i don't know .
i mean, yes, we have to assimilate her , but
stop it !
i suppose to certain extenize her duties , _ try to make a better human being .
exactly .
now , she shouldn't have time problems or be obssesed about her weight .
and she has to learn how to drive .
stick !
and football and sunday does not end
untill monday night .
this is perfect .
oh , there's so much stuff .
i don't even know where to begin .
my vow is for housebreaking .
that's nasty .
oh, come on !
here , these are books .
we learn things by reading these .
television, however is much easier to use and much more fun .
television .
this is a home arcade system . very cool .
i've got 49 games that you can play on this , 48 of which, are sports games .
some times, it is fun , to watch one friend's puke . puke . this is toiletpaper .
this is hair . never spend more than five minutes styling .
definitly .
may be ten . this too, toiletpaper .
when you really on the pench .
jonas is an  asshole .
when we see felix , we  kick him .
these are nipples . nipples .
now show me yours .
no , no , you don't have to do that . come on .
stop it , would you cut it out?
these are flowers .
flowers are not important .
no . bad . movies with singing
duh, crap .  unacceptable . yes . seriously , size doesn't matter .
run . i run , you run , henry runs
lch run , you run , henry run .
i get it already .
are we gonna stay here all day?
can we go do something fun?
come on, give me a pass !
split fingers , fast ball .
got it?
got it .
all right . throw to henry now .
that's not henry .
sorry man , sheve never played baseball
hey, i didn't do .... !
aah !
that's called giving him a " bitch lap " .
this is pizza .
we eat food , to survive .
oh, you damned .
this, this is how we make pizza .
mmh !
stuck .
oh . oh , whoa let me , you haven't !
this is beer .
beer is good .
mmm .
beer is good .
i like that . that's just impressiver .
here , have another one .
split all back, drop to middle .
okay ! pop quiz .
what is this one?
nature documentary .
if it's about sharks, or animals attacking people ,
they're good . otherwise .... boring .
excellent . high five .
ae h, like this .
yeah , this way .
oh .
kill him ! that's good ! very good !
hey, look at you face . i've blewn you head off
it was an accident .
kate?
kate !
kate, oomf !
kate , stop it !
right foot, that's your gas .
that's what gonna make you go .
now your left foot , that's .. that's the brake !
uh !
shi
can you beleive i could keep this stuff up?
it's incredible .
so i'm gonna keep teaching her what's important .
oh, yeah .
oh, my god , my leg !
you know , i think i'm gonna go stop the car .
the " wedding singulars " is good?
oh, yeah .
the wedding is the best .
what's that?
that's called kissing .
it's what two people, who like each other do , to show each other , that .. that they like each other .
i like you , max .
i i like you too , kate .
but i don't think , we should do any thing
you taste like peperoni .
i'm hungery .
okay . go , nice and snug .
thank you , max .
this is the best thing i've ever had .
i'm glad you'd enjoyed it .

aah ! ah !
oh .
it's okay , it's okay .
learning time is over .
so , good night .
good night .
so that's what you do with a johnson .
do you always have to do it in a hot tub?
oh , no , you can do it where ever you like , and at any time ,
and with as many girls as possible .
you don't even have to know thier names .
dammit .
what is wrong with you?
what are you doing?
why you showing her that?
you said show her what is important , and this is very important to me .
oh , come on .
oh , well , watching all these pornos makes me horny .
oh , this is awesome . no .
no sex . we have enough to worry about than this .
hey , will you do some of this?
what we do think about , we don't think about sex .
looks at that .
the defense is playing like shit !
get to the quarterback !
don't let them tremple like that !
get in there, put him on his ass !
dude , we are fuckin 'geniuses .
this game sucks .
let's go home and have sex .
uh, we're ready to close out here . come on , please . pretty please  that's not a good ldea .
oh, come on . listen
i learned some really cool stuff from those pornos ...
and there is that one thing called the blowjob .
you know , i can do it right here .
what? no , stop it !
he he he .
no , you are not ready for blowjobs .
i'm not?
no .
dude .
damn .
i gotta practice .
excuse me !
anybody wants a blowjob? yeah, i do sure .
on a second thought , let's go . let's go home
hey ! you know what?
we should probably ask another woman to join us , because they always do that in the videos . oh, that waht they do?
yeah
thank you , henry !
oh , hey .
my friend max ,
is gonna take me home and fuck me like the bitch i'm .
you wanna come?
that's the hiroine talking .
what's hiroine?
that was nice, it was like a frek show
ah !
sex , now .
i heard that !
i really love you kate, but i just ,
i feel like you're the results of the complications ,
involving .. um, you know , emotinal attachement .
less talking, more sex .
valid argument .
there's still though, i mean numerous ethical dominants ,
inheriting the act ,
including
lower .
no , no , not . you technically, you're ten years old .
you don't wanna have sex with me?
no , i don't .
yes , i do .
max , i think you accidentally locked the door !
it's definitly locked !
would you just get my leg back . i may be
oh .
could we, could we jus  schhhh .
aah !
ooh !
it kicks the shit outta kissing !
high five !
well , i'm beat .
kate? , you want ... you wanna talk?
kate?
morning , babe .
you were great last night .
i feel ,
like i just got back of the rodeo .
well, i hope you are hungery ,
cause i made an omelett . or something like an omelett .
i'm good , thanks .
oh . okay .
you know what you gona need this morning?
oh , what's that?
me .
no , no .
no , i have to go to work .
oh, can i go? no no no .
i need you to stay here, and hold down the fort ,
like a trooper
and there are rules , for when i'm gone . okay?
brush your teeth .
several times .
no leaving the house , when i'm not here .
if anything happens , i need you to call me at this
special emergency number .
says lab .
kate?
kate , did you hear me?
yeah , whatever .
when will you be home?
i don't know exactly .
i have a lot of work to do today .
but, there is plenty of things here you can entertain yourself with . you got a globe , there is some dice over there .
ae h , there is a book .
you should try reading a book .
or a magazine !
and then there is albums and cds and , ae h
ofcourse, there is always the television as well !
max !
we got a problem ! i was drunk , i was weak . _ lch intend not before , with it to sleep . 'n was error .
you know i didn't mean to sleep with her . big mistake .
yeah? well , it is just got bigger .
couldn't possibly get any bigger we meet again !
aah !
i told you he'd be excited , to see you . what , you?
what happened .. you were flying . you were jetting
no . modern science thought there may be a bigger story here
so, jonas agreed to let me spend a week in the lab, he's even renting me his guest room .
i'm going to be here untill your presentation .
isn't that exciting?
more than you could possibly imagine .
what about your boyfriend?
isn't he upset?
he is not my boyfriend anymore .
we broke up .
but he seemed like such a nice guy, very, very talented .
may be you should go back and give him a second chance, and patch things up .
i don't think that's gonna happen .
after talking to you the other day ,
i realised how truely important my work is to me .
and derek just never got that .
it was time to break it off .
is something wrong?
no ,
i just , ah ,
i didn't think i was gonna see you again
for the rest of my life .
i just hope you guys don't get sick of me ,
because i'm gonna be around you guys 24 hours a day .
ooh, look who finally decided ... to join us this morning ..
i need you to look at fluffy two .
something is wrong with her .
with fluffy? what's wrong?
this is all she does .
well , i suppose if we look on putting all the hamster production on one flew off the cocko's nest ,
we've been in pretty good shape, will we?
we have a genetics conference in three days , and we don't have yet a perfect clone !
so , nobody leaves this lab untill this problem is fixed .
ah , sir , i have very important business to take care of tonight .
well, it's a shame ,
and though i thought you'd be quite dedicated to this job .
hey , max , if fluffy is going all funny ,
you think this has anything to do with?
no , she has a human brains ,
the most advanced learning device that ever known to man .
she is probably in home , memorizing the encyclopedia .
yes !
go , go
so much for the replicator , huh?
ah ! aua !
my hormon growth solution reminds gives me extra kick, if you will, to the growth medium only the kick if you want so .
and thus, with the hyper+stimulated cell division  you can bypass the stages of normal cell growth to create an adult clone .
impressive .
but how do you deal with the keytone shift
of the mitochondrian variation during rapid zellmitoses?
well , i would mind abored you with the technical jugg on , miss carson , because it's very, very complicated stuff . oh, my godness !
ah , i wonder , what is going on over there over there , in the hamster research station .
well , ti looks like fluffy two stopped running into the wall .
yes, because she is not in her self conscious, sir ,
ah , even after i put a helmet on her . i think i figured out what's wrong .
the cloning process messes up the brain .
fluffy two pain receptors actually formed as pleasure receptors .
which explains , why she keeps pumbing her head into the wall .
she finds the experience joyfull .
felix , only you could come up with the scientific theory
messes up the brain .
now please , one of you has actually learned something today?
wait a second .
that's it , sir .
learning . there is nothing wrong with fluffy two's brain .
she just hadn't had the experience yet .
she will learn how to behave from other members of her species .
we isolated this clone .
i think , we should put her with other hamsters .
are you saying , a clone made from this process ,
has the capacity to learn?
yes , sir ,
it's exactly what i'm saying .
jaah
heja ! ouch ...
max , you think i can get that interview? now?
no , but felix will be more than happy to sit down with you .
we'll speak tomorrow .
so , eh
you seem like a really nice person .
oh , hi . i found this in your bed .
and i need some of these tit restraining devices .
wait a sec .
hi . i'm brandy .
how are you guys today?
i'm working on it , brandy .
how are you?
oh , i'm fine , thank you .
is there anything i can help you with? yeah .
we need a shit lot o 'bras .
oh .

what's this look like?
whoa !
sorry .

hollywood .
oh .
ah , you look , like a size 36 c.
amm , i'll go check basic support , and why don't you feel free to look around?
thanks , brandy .
okay , you can't show your boobs to everybody .
there are rules . we'll talk about them .
okay , this is, a ... ah , this is a thong . girls like them .
i don't really understand why .
hey .
hey . okay , this
try this on . if it fits , we can get out of here .
oh , so we already know each other a day , and you already buying me a lingerie?
do you always move this fast?
yes , always . very
no , no , i don't .
i just enjoy shopping , for lingerie . i haven't an act for it .
oh . yes , you do .
listen , i interviewed felix .
but i understand that you are the one i need to talk to .
so , if you some time right now
i would love to get this interview ...
now is not so great .
how do you know my size?
i'm just a lucky guess . i'm a lucky guy .
what you say we try it on?
not together, ofcourse .
carefull, there is a broken glass in here .
okay, i know this is a shit lot of bra, but here .
brandy , these are all dreadfull . all of them .
we need more . could you get more?
okay .
shopping is over .
let's go .
no, wait , i need some bras , and i don't wanna come here yet, everything tastes that .
fine . how is this?
okay , we'll test try ...
no, not here . you do that in the changing room, okay?
okay . go to
oh , no .
oh, what are you doing back? you're not supposed to be in here?
ah um , i know .
yes , but i found something else that i think you might like .
oh , really? what?
ma'am , i think you gonna  this, i found this for you .
wait a minute , this is much racier than the one i asked you for .
well , there is nothing wrong with being a little racy .
go !
i'll go .

i know, is that what cold beer does to you? no . but , sometimes .
i think may be we moved too fast .
i just , i need some time , okay? to sort things out .
okay , whatever .
i'm sorry about this .
but you know what? we can find other fun stuff to do .
you can .
all i need is a sixpack of alcohol an a vibrator .
nice job . thank you .

he said he was gonna join us .
you asked max to join us?
yeah , it was all his idea .
then there must be some .. max wouldn't

to take the blood samples .
no , no, that's not necessary . cause i was gonna wear a condom .
why don't you just grap the hamsters, and we'll get started?
you wanna have these hamsters? !
i don't know anyway to do without them .
but , the thing is
henry, i need to talk to you !
max, thank god you're here .
felix ! would you give me a hand here?
ah ! aah !
whoa .
the original was the clone .
and which you thought was the clone , was the original .
the clone came to work when we were away , but then the original came back ,
and i've got to get the clone home now before the original sees her !
what was the first bit again? that , ah um , the clone
you were speaking to the clone . who is that? that is the original !
but she wanted to
just keep an eye on things !
okay .
okay .
max , there is something wrong with fluffy two . she sounds sick .
sick?
what's wrong with fluffy two?
what's up?
i don't know .
well she seems like a little indigesting may be . did you take samples?
no, not yet . get me a hypo, henry .
but that's blood, you
there is no time . get the needle .
okay .
max, are you sure? i mean, what if there's something wrong with the cloning process?
there is nothing wrong with the process .
hello , everybody .
hi .
how is our project coming on?
fine , sir .
this is a perfectly , healthy clone .
that is fuckin 'awesome .
what did you do? !
aaah !
i just stuck in the needle , stuck in the needle .
i knew she was sick !
so what does that mean? every clone we make is gonna explode .
oh , no . oh , no !
aah ! aah !
sir, please, sir . please !
oh , god , you do not look so good .
i feel so good .
i feel like i'm gonna burst .
oh, jesus . you are ! take cover ! we all might die .
everyone take cover !
we need a doctor immediately !
sir , there is others in front of you .
mary langner , this is a matter of life and death .
that woman can explode any minute
when she does, the whole building comes down with her .
i need every doctor you've got .
and possibly the bomb squad .
what's wrong?
am i gonna be okay?
i think that's the last ever .
i think there's a little bit intestinals up here . .
actually , i believe that's a spleen .
i don't care what it is ,
just, clean it up .
get it off the ceiling . if you don't mind .
where is max?
ah , he had an emergency to tale care of .
oh , he had an emergency to tale care of , i see .
that makes all sense to me .
do me a small favor .
if anybody hears from max , would you give him a message from me? .
would you tell him , to get his ass back here !
now !
okay .
hydrogen sulfat , danger explosive
she's had a little bit too much soda , but otherwise she's fine .
so that's it?
i mean , that she's not going to explode?
ah , no, no .
in fact , she is healthiest person ..
i've ever seen in my life . really?
not enough of cholesterol , perfect x rays , every blood cell .. seems to be brand new ,
max , watch , if i leave this thing longer , my whole arm turns purple .
look !
no , she's not the brightest bomber, is she?
hey, you know what's on tonight? wrestling !
let's order pizza !
i don't want pizza , okay?
i think i'm going on a diet .
we're starting a bite job .
just once, i would love to sit down and , i don't know ... talk !
hello , can you can you talk to me? can we do that?
i do not think so , okay? that's not funny , kate .
i smell that cooking !
we never talk .
i'm not just some thrusting, verile ...
okay , okay .
quite, quite .
come on .
we can talk , okay?
we can have a nice happy conversation about
ouch , that's a little rough !  wrestling ! body slam ! i've got you now !
</ i > this is henry . listen . < i>
< i>your job is on the line . </ i >
< i>jonas is pissed that you didn't finally started going</ i > < i>you better call me . </ i >
dammit , kate , would you get off me?
< i>max , it's kate . </ i >
you know someone else named kate?
ah , i  who is she? !
ouch ! no one important , okay? ! who is she? !
she is the reporter ,
i went to lunch with .
she is covering my work .
do you wanna screw up? we are just friends . okay
we didn't have a lot in common .
i just enjoy being with her .
so , that's a total waste of time .
okay , tabby , comes .
enough for a threat .
time for some sex !
not tonight , i have headache .
auu !
max , how did it go last night?
any more problems with repli kate?
problems?
all i have is problems .
wet still have to move the replicator to the auditorium for the presentation ,
we've no idea what happened to poor fluffy two ,
and i have an insane clone , literally , destroying my appartment .
she's developed into a reality problem, henry .
what you mean?
waht i mean, i think we made a mistake .
we should've exposed her to a few feminine influences .
like what? dishing?
i'm seriuos .
i'm hanging out with repli kate , and she is acting just like a guy .
but it is not as good as we thought it was going to be .
i'm begining to wonder , what women even seen us
dude , wat's your problem?
she is a woman ,
who acts like a man , it's what every man wants .
no, it's what every man says he wants ,
may be all the things we don't understand about women
all this little korks they drive us crazy , may be this is more important than we realize .
repli kate listens , but she doesn't hear me .
she's completly self involved .
i don't know , she just hasn't date i feel like i'm dating ..... me ....
i'll never get that lucky .
what do you think what happens if the real kate found out?
don't even say that .
don't you think she has the right to know?
oh , you ldiot .
two identical women , and you fall for the one that blew you in a bar .
carefull with that .
that is expensive . do you understand me? you get it , expensive , cost a lot money .
is kate here?
yeah, over there .
that's not gonna fit through those door , felix .
hey , what happened to you yesterday?
i've tried to reach you .
i'm so sorry i didn't call you back .
i've been, i had to rush a friend of mine into the university infirmary .
i hope i'm not interrupting , but i just heard something very funny , and i thought i'd share it with you, my friends .
evidentally, it was discovered that the reason fluffy two exploded ... was because someone in here fed her hydrogen sulfat .
now, here is the funny part
it was discovered by miss carson , who was not a geneticist by profession .
and yet seems to know more about what's going on this lab
than you two , pathetic excuses scientists .
i have a presentation in 24 hours , and just yesterday we have disquit the guest honour off the walls with a shammy . now !
this replicator has to be moved , a new clone made and a new set of data derived .
if this is not done, if this presentation is in anyway compromised , then you will not only be out of the job tomorrow ,
but i will see to it you will never work in this field again .
do you dig it? !
sir , if you thinking, by threatening me , you can force me .. to be your slave, well
you can't shit .
max , i have
oh , miss carson , i don't think max needs any more distractions from you .
now, why don't we discuss the nights lnterview with my home .
dude, you'll be here all night .
repli kate's gonna freak .
no, she won't, cause you gonna be keeping an eye on her . what?
just , give her two sixpacks .. of burger and several hours of cartoons .
okay .
hi . uh
hi , mary langner . hello .
i'm from the biomedical labs here on campus .
i understand you treated a friend of mine, yesterday .
she came came with someone named max flemming .
oh , a tall girl, good looking , no insurance?
that's her .
yes .
hey .
amm , the eighth grade was fascinatingfor a number of variations . yeah, this is so amazing .
and you've given me such wonderfull information ...
it's almost overwhelming .
i should probably get some rest before the big day tomorrow .
oh, yes , i do have a speech to prepare myself .
yes, you do . and i'm gonna let you to that ....
so, thank you so much .
well, good night .
wanna a beer?
i'm not in the mood .
what's up?
it's max .
first , i thought we was cool and all .
but he's just gone wierd on me .
he doesn't wanna play video games ,
he doesn't wanna watch sports , he's on a diet !
yeah , i didn't know he was starting to ounch up a bit .
yeah, and he's not putting out , so
what? you mean you two on
we did it once, and that was two days ago .
see, all i want is just have a lot of casual sex without getting bugged in a relationship .
but it's just he had these issues with it .
what's up with that?
i don't know .
you wanna shag someone, shag him .
what brings emotions to it, eh?
dude , exactly .
it is not natural , to have sex with the same person . and i'm young .
if somebody wants to have sex with me , i think ,
i should have sex with them .
yeah, specially when max is so into
what did you say?
oh , nothing .
this is bullshit .
so he can have sex with somebody else , and i can't .
are you thinking what i'm thinking?
what are you thinking?
i'm sorry to bother you so late, sir , but i have something may be you really need to see .
have you seen this? that woman has given max full credit for the replicator !
okay , but i
after all i've done for that kid , and this is how he rebays me? !
if this goes to print , i'm finished !
i'm not so sure about that .
you gonna take a look at this .
why the long face?
i just wanted to hel people, kate that's all i've wanted to do .
and now it seems like .... every single thing i touch , turns to complete shi
i can't stop screwing up .
max , listen . every great inventor screwed up
it took edison over thousand attempts , to create the light bulb . if you don't make mistakes , you'll never learn .
how much of the repilcator was your idea?
that's hard to specify, i mean , jonas fill all the paper , and felix does a pretty job bringing bagels in the morning ...
public figure .
90 percent .
max, listen to me, you are going to help people .
you know , may be one day, you might even take credit for your own work .
this can't be .
it is , ...
that's the charts for the woman max took to the hospital ,
here's the charts for fluffy two .
find this woman , tonight !
i'll do my best , sir .
mention " left me " ...
and for years , i've dreamed we could get back together .
and may be get married .
but it never did , because of the fucken dog .
enough with the murder mouth .
are you ready to go again yet?
again?
it's been five years , you know?
there is a limit to how long a man can go ! oh , really?
yeah .
i'm outta here . what?
besides , we're out of beer .
all i need is ten minutes ...
and i'll be fine ! kate !
oh, my godness .
she's perfect .
she sure is .
so, the woman that called you in the lab the other day ,
was she an ex girlfriend?
ah , sort of .
what was she like?
she was surprisingly like you
in a lot of ways ,
too much like me in all the others .
to tell you the truth , she is  so you're not seeing anyone?
no .
excuse me !
excuse me !
have anyone seen a girl just gone , that wants to have sex all the time?
yeah, she's in the back ..
with the easter bunny and santa claus .
she better be not shagging them .
kate? kate !
i'm just com here to surprise you .
well, you did .
who the hell are you?
oh , are you still mad of me?
you , you look amazing .
did you do change your hair?
no , it just got messed while i was banging henry .
ah , you slept with another guy already?
it didn't take very long , kate .
no, shit . it lasted two minutes stops .
what you're doing is did it back to me ......
because you pissed that i screwed on you?
no .
i'm doing this to get max for sleeping around on me .
ma max?
you slept with two guys?
yeah , and i'm looking for more .
okay , all right , baby , you made your point .
i cheated on you , i was on tour , and i was wrong ,
and i'm sorry .
okay?
but they were groupies , baby .
it's not a thing with real women .
i don't care who you sleep with ,
what , you don't care ,
if i'm having sex with other women , while i'm having sex with you?
wait , you mean like threesome?
no ! i will be totally into that .
i .. i get off a ten .
i know where to go .
that's what i feel .
me too, me too .
thank you , kate .
thank you for tonight .
and for everything you said .
i really needed that .
do you know the real reason i broke up with derek?
amm , because he was holding you back from doing what you really wanted to do
no?
no .
because he was in a million years , he'd never do anything as sweet as this .
hey , beautifull .
do you really move when i ask you to join a threesome?
ah umm . yeah .
you know , i got my ride waiting out ,
he's dumb , but he is hot .
could we make that a foursome?
oh , absolutely .
the more , the merrier .
let's go .
excuse me please . kate , wait !
kate !
no , wait . what?
we shouldn't do this .
if jonas finds
no . he won't .
he is in his office , practicing his speech .
besides , i don't want you to go .
come .
you go ahead , make yourself comfortable
and while i'm refreshing up .
he can't get angry at me for not finding her ,
this is a big town , i'm just one guy .
she's not gonna just fall on my lap .
so , you're staying there?
the stay address your author gave me?
yeah , that will do .
what is going on?
we are allowed to be here , right?
oh , who gives a shit?
go find a bedroom .
go , bedroom .
hi .
let's get this show on the road , girls .
yeah . come on .
he finally came to accept this .
oh . kate . wow .
mamma . listen , kate , ah umm
i could not dreamed of this whole thing any better ,
but there is something that i absolutely have to tell you
enough talking .
i have a surprise for you .
oh , what the hell?
hello?
kate?
i'm back .
jonas , jonas .
jonas , are you around? jonas !
i found her , sir !
sorry, sir . she's downstairs .
i love that spot .
it's like you know me already .
you know , usually i don't do this so fast , but the last guy with this , he sucked in bed .
i'll go find the bedroom .
i'll be right there .
go on ahead , i'll be right there .
ouch !
thank you .
this is redicilous .
oh
wow . you are aside as i'm .
nice trick .
oh , my god .
max !
now , felix !
take that , bitch !
could you be any more incompetent?
give me a hand .
oh , my god !
oh yeah, my better .
oh , yes !
oh , god , i think i'm gonna explode !
henry , is that you? who the hell is henry?
whoa , whoa , is there somebody else in here?
yes !
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
oh , my god , it's derek waters from green snake !
hey , what's up?
where the hell is kate? !
i was with kate !
she was with me .
you and kate? l was with kate !
who the hell are you?
whoa , whoa !
if you all there ,
who is licking my balls?
uuuh !
uuh !
kate ! kate , where are you?
kate ! shit !
oh , shit .
no, shit .
you cannot do this to us , jonas .
i'm not responsible for your situation ,
max is . he cloned you .
i'm simply looking out for your best interrests .
by kidnapping us?
you always wanted to be in science , oh, now you are science .
you feel it lucky . punk? !
kate !
this is absolutely incredible .
she is a perfect clone .
sir , these women seemed kinda scared .
you sure this is the best way to handle ..?
don't be so thick headed .
the potential of this research , was always to clone a human being .
and now , that max drop us one on our laps , you won't let her go .
those are no longer women in there ,
they're founds for information that must be mined for science .
now, i've gotta go rehears my speech .
you stay here .
nobody goes in or out of that lab except me , understand? !
yeah .
put a line !!
may be next prepare your hands
you stay away from me .
what's up?
jonas has the kates .
and he has revised his presentation , in order to frame us .
oh, that dick !
the moment those two girls walk across the stage tomorrow ,
they'll become lab rats for the rest of their lives .
yeah , we gotta call the cops .
where is the phone?
and say what, henry?
that somebody stole our clone .
we don't even know where they are .
we know precisely that ... they'll be tomorrow at 9 : 00 am . presentation .
right . so what do we do?
we use this .
pubes?
that oh, yeah .
max , that bastard .
how could he do this to me? to us?
i don't know .
besides he's nagging and wagging
he was kinda cool to me .
i'm fine with him .
that doesn't make what he did any less wrong .
he created you, so to a relationship with .
and why was he so interested in being with you?
get out of here !
what? i'm sorry?
get out of here ! now !
but i thought
get out , get out !
get out , get out !
good clone, jonas .
such a good clone .
i think that went pretty well
it was hell of training him a five whole words .
penis .
ah , six words .
you shouldn't have taught him that .
son of a don't worry , we'll get you out of here ! right now !
stay there , stay .
tou have a lot of explaining to do .
i cloned you by accident .
i know it's not an excuse , but it is the truth .
yeah , i did terrible thing , but i'm not like jonas .
i'm still the guy was last night ,
the guy, who is completely in love with you .
and will do anything for you .
could you be any sappier?
the girls actually falls for this shit?
i screwed up .
kate , i cloned you by accident .
i know it's not an excuse ...
i heard you . but i see still have a thing for cloning people .
i don't know , i didn't know any way else to do .
as soon as jonas tell the world that you're a clone and she's a clone
just get me out of here .
all right . sorry .
you gonna be a research project for the rest of your live .
yeah , i know you hate me right now i'm not even blaming you .
but if we get out of here , we've got to work together .
okay , what do we do?
we just had to get you out of here before jonas makes his speech .
where is repli jonas? !
oh, punk .
find repli jonas , stall him !
do not let him get to the stage !
oh , here he is . excuse me .
where are you? i've got a room full of people, waiting to see you .
whenever the front ..
when ever the frontiers of genetics are explored
felix ! felix !
if memory serves me correct , i thought i had asked you to stay back at the lab and guard the kates .
and so , a question comes to mind .
and you know what that question is?
ah umm , no .
why are you here?
oh , sir, i wouldn't have guessed  zip it !
now why don't you go back to the lab and stay there , untill i tell you to leave .
you can do that for me, can't you?
can you do that for me?
you can do it, right?
do it !!
okay , guys , guys , come .
she sells, sea shells, she sells, sea shells
this is giovanni bellini , president of largest
genetics research company in rome , gene ltalia .
i'm a big fan of your work i'm very excited to see this today .
get out of here !
no, seriuosly .
i'm excited .
and , ah , this is max , dr. fromer's chief research assistant .
oh , you must be great , working with a genius like dr. fromer .
oh . i'm here because of dr. fromer .
he made me what i'm today .
i'm here because of dr. fromer .
he made me what i'm today .
i have a very important question to ask the doctor .
if you can excuse us .
such fun of the staff . parbequeue
first he tells me to watch the kates , then he tell me not to watch the kates ,
then he says to watch them again .
and i'm gonna get some trouble

kate?
oh , jonas . guess what?
your clones escaped .
i won't be so sure about that !
get her !
how is there in beirut?
whenever the fronteers men of genetics go exploring ,
they can encounter a questionable morality .
why are you doing this? you know you don't have to .
i'm squirrel with a nut , trying not to knock you, kate .
holy shit !
another clone ! jonas !!
have it !
another clone !
oh !
and felix is down to the ten . yeeeah !
go , we get jonas . repli jonas !
with this hamster , i will demonstrate to you ....

ah !
oh !

no , it was " penis " .
ah , we don't know .
and now , we take this blood here , and  we combine it with some genetic , ah um , hormone stuff , put it right in the replicator
malfunctlon .
and now , ladies and gentlemen
abnormal dna palrs .
repllcatlon errors !
prepare yourself for the unbelievable ,
a fully grown , adult clone !
is that bad?
is that bad?
there seems to be a small technical problem ,
ladies and gentlemen , but
i can assure you that this machine does indeed work .
because my assistant max even cloned a human being in this machine .

don't trust them, ladies and gentelmen because these clones are crafty .
