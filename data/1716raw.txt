i'll give you a prescription .
okay .

yes .
follow me , please .
get well soon !
there are two men waiting outside who want to talk to you , doctor .
who?
they look like soldiers .
what do you want?
this can't be .
what does that mean?
producer : lsao kurosu
atsushi muroga
i saw that he was really suffering .
cool !
i walked out on him immediately , of course .
and now i'm working really hard on having a good relationship soon .
i'm so happy that i got rid of him .
don't let that kind fool you , girls !
poor guy !
he really is to be pitied .
but now to something different .
we have another listener's request .
it comes from satomi kinjo from urasan .
and her wish is " pit in " with " a few dance more " .
get down , everybody !
he said , get down !
freeze !
hey ! lf you want to stay alive you'd better be a good boy !
this is no toy , understand? !
hello?
hello , this is sawaki from happy motors speaking .
can i help you?
sorry , but i'm very busy now .
i'll call you back later .
please wait , there is ...
hello?
well ...
we'd just like to know whether you're taking the car or not .
there are quite a lot of customers who are really interested in this model ...
i'll take it .
i'll call you back !
it hurts !
step on !
it hurts like hell !
what happened?
this fucking idiot managed to get caught by a woman ...
i think she's dead .
dead?
did you shoot her?
otherwise i would be dead now .
but did you really have to kill her? !
she's alive .
i didn't aim at her precious parts intentionally .
there is no turning back anyway .
right?
and what about me? !
i'm wounded !
shut up , you idiot !
don't worry .
the wound isn't that deep .
just keep calm .
liar !
it hurts like hell !
well , of course it hurts a bit ...
not only a bit !
well?
how did things go?
child's play ...
child's play? !
you fucking idiot !
akira !
it's not that bad .
when we have the money , you can afford your own private nude nurse !
don't you dare lie to me !
of course not !
we'll sell them , right?
yeah , don't worry about it .
i already took care of that .
hello?
just a moment , please .
this is our man .
ramon speaking ...
ah , it's you .
i've been waiting for your call .
did things work out well?
sure , everything is perfect .
the rocks are worth about 100 . 000 . 000 yen .
great .
but before talking about prices , i want to see the goods .
but i'll be prepared to pay the 100 . 000 . 000 in cash .
is that so?
do you agree to talk about the price right now?
okay .
our meeting place ...
take the 58 westward , than you'll arrive at an old factory site .
we'll meet there .
an old factory site?
good idea .
that's an adequate place !
okay .
we'll need about ...
one hour .
we'll be there in an hour .
we'll be waiting for you ...
wow !
100 . 000 . 000 yen !
100 . 000 . 000 yen !!
25 . 000 . 000 for every one of us !
i can finally buy me a porsche !
we made it , akira !
feels like a dream .
won't there be any difficulties at our meeting place?
no .
this is no residential area , the police shows up quite seldom .
extremely rarely .
i know for sure that there isn't anybody around now .
is that so?
if the stuff is good it's worth driving all the way out there .
here is the money .
quite a good deal ...
okay .
let's go .
that's impossible !
then do something !
oh my god ...
here?
i guess so .
you can't conclude a deal like that in the middle of the town , can you?
but the yakuzas complete their deals in chinese restaurants , don't they?
shut up !
when we have the money , you can eat chinese every fucking day .
hello , this is happy motors .
our name stands for confidence and service .
yeah .
what can i do for you?
yeah .
i'm sorry , but i was really busy when i received your call .
because of the car ...
what? !
well , we already sold it to some other client .
of course you were top of the list , that's why i called you immediately .
but you simply hung up ...
wait !
i told you that i would take it !
that's easy to say ...
i'll pay in cash .
just do something !
maybe there is still something that i can do for you ...
you're lucky , my other client hasn't signed the bill of sale yet .
in that case , my comission would rise a bit , of course ...
how much? !
wait !
you're trying to rip me off , aren't you?
i see .
i'll come to your shop tomorrow morning and drop in the money .
okay? !
bye !
asshole !
was that her?
child's play !
after all , these babies were invented to make you rich , weren't they?
you're the greatest !
the car seller cheated you , didn't he?
leave me alone .
i didn't know that you are so mad about cars ...
i'm mad about fast cars in combination with loud music .
in my car , i expect women to stay on the passenger seat ...
i'm fed up with being the passenger .
i've found this completely unsatisfactory .
because you've climbed into the wrong cars ...
men are all the same anyway !
what's up?
if you don't stop this , you'll be dead before you've spent your money !
but my foot hurts !
you have to clean the wound .
you're acting like a doctor .
i'm a nurse .
really?
yes .
i used to work at a big hospital in tokyo .
one of the doctors was always trying to paw me , that's why i quit .
did he try it in the car?
oh doctor !
please don't !
we need some more water .
hey !
should i tell you how you can get a really cheap car?
how?
i've changed my mind .
it wouldn't work with a women's libber like you anyhow .
i see !
presumably the total value of the stolen jewellery is ... more than 100 . 000 . 000 yen .
an employee of the jeweller's shop ... was seriously injured during the raid .
she was put in a hospital , but she's still in a coma .
here's the weather forecast ...
how do i look?
as a gangster , you have to keep an eye on your outfit ...
who is that ramon anyway?
probably a yakuza .
but i've been told that he pays really good for hot stuff .
but can we trust him?
don't shit on yourself , kabu .
everything's just fine .
everything is going well .
my plan has turned out to be absolutely perfect .
seems like it .
are you still planning to go to the philippines?
yeah , that's right .
in this country , there seems to be no place for me ...
they're still after you because of that immoveables thing , right?
i'm looking for a water pipe .
we have to clean akira's wound .
that's not necessary !
we should have bought some bandages .
allright , i'm off .
no !
you scared me to death !
did you find water?
i think i saw something over there .
really?
wait !
what's up?
do you have a weakness for akira by any chance?
what does that mean?
the way you're taking care of him ...
like you're having a little carry on .
bullshit !
there's one thing you shouldn't forget ...
it was me who got you into this .
because of me ... you'll earn quite a lot of money .
so what?
i think you'd better take care of me .
i'll be very kind to you ...
we can kill these two idiots and go fifty fifty , if you want to .
i'm different than those guys .
and one fine day ...
i'll be very rich .
come on ...
be my little sweetheart ...
leave me alone !
are you lesbian?
if i was your girlfriend , i'd probably turn into one ...
stupid bitch !
kabu?
kabu , is that you?
what was that?
that was jun's voice !
what happened?
upstairs !
is it the cops?
look at that .
what kind of a factory is this anyhow?
looks like a chemical factory .
what's that?
corpses !
what is this place?
maybe the secret mortuary of the yakuza ...
nonsense !
where's jun?
look ... !
you monsters !!
hey !
what the fuck is going on here? !
they are possibly zombies !
living dead !
they're still alive !
how is such a thing possible?
no idea !
let's get out of here !
these creatures are hiding somewhere !
i don't want to be eaten !
let's clear off !
i was so worried because you didn't stay by your car ...
are you ramon?
are you jun?
i heard a shot .
what happened?
jun is dead .
he got killed .
killed?
what does that mean?
there's nothing more to say .
that monster ate him !
what?
there are zombies around here .
zombies?
joking apart .
after all , we're here to talk business ...
that's no joke .
we have to get out of here !
we can talk business somewhere else .
no .
we'll stay here .
this place is teeming with zombies !
they already caught one of us !
i see ...
you killed jun to increase your share .
not bad ...
what are you talking about?
relax .
okay .
give us a look ...
where's the money?
marvellous .
really excellent .
not bad , if i consider that you're no pros ...
how much?
well ...
the price will be high ...
what does that mean?
you bastard !
if you go home like good boys and girls , you'll stay alive ...
you can't do that !
you fucking bastard !
kabu , don't !
kabu !
what about you?
i'm sorry ...
well?
what are you going to do now?
you'd better give up .
isn't this place full of zombies?
you'd better go home , otherwise they might kill you .
help ... !
fuck you .
all of you !
what's that? !
jun ...
come on !
stop them !
you son of a bitch !
what's going on here? !
what are you waiting for?
shoot him !
he really is a zombie ...
catch them !
kill them !
don't let them get away !
quick !
fuck !
they caught kabu , too !
what do we do now? !
jun ...
he's alive ...
that's not jun anymore !
what about the jewellery?
they're going to steel them !
no idea !
i'm wounded !
you idiot !
that's why i hate men !
asshole !
come on !
what is this place?
let's go !
i'll kill you !
akira !
saki !
oh shit !
hey !
can anybody hear me?
what's up?
come here at once !
i'm right under the stairs !
what happened?
hurry !
let go of me !
that was ramon's voice !
these monsters have guzzled him .
he's bound to be still in here .
we have to get the jewellery back .
we have to get out of here !
could you give me just one reason why you're here?
don't make such a fuss !
a real man would go straight out there and fight !
all you're doing is wailing !
two of our friends are dead .
don't you have any balls? !
allright .
let's go !
i have to .
oh my god ... !
this way !
oh no ... !
we're lost !
we found him ...
let's clear off !
fuck it ...
saki !
saki !
do something !
saki !
come on !!
come on !!
don't let go of me !
saki !
saki !!
akira ...
shit !
what are these army guys doing here?
help !!
what's happening here?
help me !!
are you okay?
who ...
who are you?
what are you doing here?
get up .
the whole place is going to explode in a minute .
explode?
i'll destroy them .
good idea ...
an eye witness told the police that he saw a white van on the scene of crime .
the police closed off several roads hoping to locate this vehicle .
shit !
did you create these zombies?
i never wanted to create a monster .
because of them , my friends are dead now .
and i won't get my porsche either !
one of them is very intelligent .
what?
that's not a normal zombie .
he's really clever .
he managed to deactivate the bomb .
hello?
saki? !
hello , akira?
hello?
hello !
hello?
where are you? !
saki !
what a fucking asshole !
i knew it .
takashi !
kyoko ...
i wanted you to live again .
i couldn't think of anything else .
takashi?
you died two years ago .
you died in a car accident .
no .
you may not live ..
takashi ...
you monster ...
shit !
are you okay?
we must get out of here !
give me the key .
here it is .
you have to leave now .
i'll activate the self destruction mode .
that's impossible !
you're wounded !
if i don't blow up the lab , they'll take possession of the whole town .
this woman ...
she's my wife .
what?
i took part in the generation of a revolutionary medicine .
i wanted to raise my wife from the dead .
but it went all wrong .
i'm so sorry that i've dragged you into this .
actually i'm on the run because i robbed a jeweller's shop ...
i see .
take this .
you can handle it , can't you?
goodbye .
you fucking bitch !!
are you okay? !
let's go !
wait .
what are you doing there?
i'm going to blow this joint .
the army researched on those zombies? !
that's it .
let's go !
you'd better go back to your husband ...
oh shit !
this way !
that's insane !!
are you allright?
look !
they're in good health , too .
there he comes .
what a sound ...
there's nothing better than a porsche !
porsche ...?
this car ...
a great car !
what does that mean?
i called the shop .
we can't use the old van anymore .
sorry that i've kept you waiting for so long .
i'd like to thank you for choosing one of our models .
i'll bring you the vehicle documents !
how did you do that?
if you pay double the amount , they bring it anywhere you like ...
double? !
i simply need your signature ...
now you just have to pay the car .
double , as we agreed upon .
and what do we do now?
i've promised you to show you how .
what?
how to get a cheap and brand new car .
3 to 4 percent can be taken for granted ...
but this way we get it at 100 percent discount .
after all we're gangsters , aren't we?
so what?
driver or passenger?
cool !
hey baby !
what about you and me?
come on , jump in !
here we go !
