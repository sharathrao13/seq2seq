strange as it may seem to you , photographers actually read .
books , magazines , even newspapers .
all right , smart ass .
who is he?
new american ambassador?
bingo .
he's got a wife , but no one seems to have a picture of her .
maybe she's camera shy .
no .
she's got a past ... ... and she's not talking .
i did some checking .
she's french .
married before , with a kid .
i got an ex i don't talk about .
what's wrong with that?
nothing , except you don't dodge photographers like you're hiding .
so you want me to nail her , right?
you are the best .
come on , you know i don't like to do this .
i feel like shit and besides , i am retired .

we'll double whatever you got .
that's very generous , but l
you don't realize who you're dealing with .
we know all about you .
your overdrawn bank account , your criminal record .
i suggest you get that picture back , and you bring it to me ... ... at the residence tomorrow morning , 1 1 a . m . sharp .
don't keep me waiting .
sir , hold on .

okay .
hi .
i'm sorry to bother you , but i rented this room last night ...
... and i think i left my disk here .
disk?
when i got home , i checked my laptop , and the backup disk was gone .
it's the only copy i have .
i searched like hell for it .
then i remember , the only place i could've left it was here .
do you mind if i take a look?
i don't think it's a good idea
thank you very much .
thank you .
i appreciate it .
thank you .
oh , my god , i got so much information on that disk .
you didn't see a disk , right?
actually , it's not a disk .
it's not like a cd or dvd or anything like that .
it's called floppy .
it's like a black thing you introduce in the computer .
i am remembering now that i put it there .
because i was working in bed .
i love , i just love to work in bed .
i bet you do too .
anyway , let me just remember exactly what i did .
i just i sat over here .
oh , my
i sat over here , put it on my lap because it's a laptop and plug it over there .
you know what happened?
it happens that i wasn't alone .
i wasn't alone , and
oh , my god !
that's not your business .
well , no , it's not .
it's not , but it is .
because ....
excuse me .
are you all right?
i think i can help you .
i have been working in a hospital , i'm a candy striper .
sit down .
give me your arms .
and relax , relax !
and breathe .
breathe and relax .
and now listen to me .
listen to me good .
i know .
i've been accused of having an overactive imagination ... ... but when a classy woman checks into an airport hotel ... ... in the morning with bullets and a gun ... ... there's one word that follows .
what word?
bang !
now , if a guy walks in , maybe there doesn't have to be a bang .
maybe there is something to talk about .
coffee?
well ....
maybe we should start with some introductions?
i don't care who you are ... ... and i don't want you to know who i am .
all right , that's fair enough .
let's call me harry .
and let's start with the shiner .
who is beating you up?
must we talk about this?
yes .
or we're gonna go find a local police station , and we'll talk about it there .
my husband .
all right .
why?
he has ... ... difficulty ... ... to control his temper .
why does he lose it?
because i can't live with him here .
why not?
i have a past here .
i was safe in the states , but here , it only takes one photo .
like the one today .
i took that picture .
so harry is nicolas bardo .
why did you follow me?
to get more photos?
no , no , i ....
i came to tell your security goon , mr. shiff ... ... l couldn't stop the picture from being published .
sorry .
anyone can see that .
you've wasted your time .
this espresso is cold .
can i get you another cup?
why?
there's nothing more to say .
can i go now?
you have the gun .
sex shops are open all day .
i don't think i'll be going to one .
how can i be sure?
just stay with me .
i need air , but i don't want to talk anymore .
ladies and gentlemen , your attention please .
we advise you not to leave luggage unattended and to beware of pickpocket .
when i got divorced , i decided to come to paris to reinvent myself .
that kind of thing .
i've got these crazy photographer ideas .
don't think i'm a paparazzi .
i hate it .
i feel like shit , but i have to make some money .
but there is a square here in paris full of coffee shops , beautiful .
this one particular with light reflections ... ... and i saw something that changed my life .
it's a great story .
this is the best part .
i know , i know .
maybe another time .
it's a great story .
but right now i'm very tired ... ... and i'd like to take a warm bath and relax a little ... ... before i go home , okay?
thank you for today .
i'll be waiting out here , just in case you need anything .
you don't trust me , do you?
no , no , no .
it's not that .
it's just being careful .
are you all right?
no .
i'm out of my medicine .
there was a pharmacy in the airport .
that's right .
my
my inhaler is in my car .
they can refill it for me there .
that wouldn't be being careful .
i ....
nicolas , take my car ... ... take my purse ... ... if you're so worried that i go somewhere .
you can call a taxi .
come on .
yes , nicolas .
i could call a taxi ... ... but i'm not going to do that .
i'm not going to need these in the bath .
wait , wait .
hold it .
definitely not going anywhere without them .
are you flirting with me?
was l?
well ....
i believe so .
yeah .
i didn't mean to .
it's just that ... ... all your boyhood stories ... ... make you so ... ... damn lovable .
was that the point?
well , it's not mine , but somebody loaned it to me .
lay down .
this doesn't make much sense .
i'm chief lnspector serra .
maybe you can help me out .
i said it already .
but , okay , all right .
mrs. watts is trying to kill herself .
i stopped her .
so she set me up for you guys , to get me out of the way .
that's it .
how did you come up with that?
i read a lot of mysteries , and i figure out the endings halfway .
i know what happened .
what happened , mr. bardo ... ... was a car belonging to ambassador watts was found in your possession .
i know that .
on the front seat was a gun , bullets ... ... a blouse and dress .
the only thing missing is the woman .
where is she?
i don't know .
i don't know .
you check out the hotel?
yeah .
we checked the room .
we found a naked waitress in a coma .
did you have anything to do with that?
no .
no , no .
i wasn't there .
i was buying an inhaler .
lnhaler?
yes !
an inhaler .
an inhaler !
all right , mrs. watts has asthma .
so i went to a pharmacy to get her prescription refilled .
that's it .
so you figured ... ... by having her car and clothes , she wasn't going anywhere?
that's correct .
yeah .
and you kept the gun so she wouldn't shoot herself?
that's right .
why would she want to do that?
excuse me?
why would she want to do that?
well , her husband was beating her up because she wanted to leave him .
the american ambassador beats his wife?
yes , that's right .
yes , and she has the face to prove it .
you see ... ... l'm kind of a mystery buff myself .
and you know what kind of mystery this is?
a kidnapping .
come on .
ambassador's wife held for ransom .
everything was going fine until someone reported a stolen car .
you didn't have time to send the ransom note .
no , no .
what are you talking about?
no .
i am no kidnapper , sir .
why don't we go to the residence and see what he has to say?
i think this is a terrible misunderstanding .
i spoke with mrs. watts .
she explained how she let mr. bardo use her car .
i don't know who reported it stolen .
it wasn't .
my attorney has indicated to me that no crime has been committed .
so i'm a little confused as to what we're doing here , inspector .
you spoke to your wife yourself?
yes , i did .
could i speak with her?
i don't think that's necessary .
this has been an awkward situation for all concerned ... ... and i really don't want to prolong it .
mrs. phillips will handle your questions from now on .
i have an engagement .
please excuse me .
lnspector serra ... ... you've displayed a boorish lack of sensitivity towards the ambassador .
we do not need or want your investigative skills employed ... ... to discover why mrs. watts was in a hotel bedroom with mr. bardo .
i suggest you return to your duties and drop this matter .
the less said about it , the better .
i'd still like to talk to mrs. watts .
and what crime has she committed?
no crime .
i just wanna see her .
well , i'm sure we all want to see lots of people .
but , fortunately , in our country and in yours ... ... they are not compelled to see us .
good day , inspector .
sir .
you know the penalty for a handgun?
i told you , it's not my gun .
then we'll just keep it .
now , about your motorcycle .
you really want to report it stolen?
lf it wasn't at the hotel , somebody took it .
why don't you look a little harder?
lf it doesn't turn up , give me a call .
sir .
you don't believe one thing i said , right?
not only don't i believe you , i don't even like you .
look , bardo , i know who you are .
ex paparazzi smart ass , who hasn't worked for seven years .
i don't know what you're up to , but it's not smart .
keep it up and you'll wind up in a cellblock full of smart guys like you .
mr. watts , if you ever want to see your wife again ... ... bring 1 0 million dollars in bearer bonds to the passerelle debilly ... ... at 2 a . m . this morning .
lf you inform the police or arrive with anyone besides yourself ... ... she will be killed .
oh , shit !
son of a bitch !
mrs. watts .
call me lily .
okay , lily .
what the hell do you think you're doing , lily?
are you mad at me?
mad?
no .
you are making everybody think i've kidnapped you .
haven't you?
that is not funny .
no , nicolas .
you're right , it's not funny .
it wasn't funny when you sold my picture either .
and then you showed up to do what?
explain?
apologize?
lie?
i was afraid for your life .
i felt responsible for it !
that's so sweet , nicolas .
i'm a bad girl , nicolas .
real bad .
rotten to the heart .
last scrape i was in , i fucked up a lot of people .
bad people , people like me .
people that don't forget .
but i was given a second chance .
so i went back to the states , where i got everything a bad girl ever wanted .
fucking watts .
he was kind of a sweet guy until being the richest man wasn't enough .
he had to have public glory .
he gave away a ton of money , bought the ambassadorship ... ... which meant the little missis got dragged out in the parisian limelight .
well , i couldn't do that , because bad people read newspapers too .
et voil .
enter my worst nightmare .
you snap that fucking picture , sell it to the tabloids ... ... and now it's only a matter of time before those bad people come running .
so i got the photographer turned blackmailer to kidnap me .
blackmailer?
you offered me money !
and i have never kidnapped anybody , you fucking bitch !
then where am i , nicolas?
why did you have my car , my clothes , a gun?
why was a ransom note e mailed from your computer?
everyone knows you did it .
i've gotta think .
what?
i've gotta think about
you don't have to think about anything .
i've got it all thought out for you .
watts is coming up here at 2 a . m . with $ 1 0 million .
now , if you start being a little nice to me ... ... l might cut you in on the take .
we are going to the police .
why would you wanna do that?
you're gonna tell them the crazy story you just told me .
come on !
what , do you think i'm stupid?
i'm not gonna tell them that story .
i'm gonna tell them the kidnapping story , starring you .
son of a bitch !
nicolas .
hold on , hold on .
i went back to that sex shop .
oh , shit .
come on .
what did you do with that other gun?
the cops took it .
they did?
yes , they did .
i got you another one .
come here .
be careful with that thing .
it's all right .
nicolas .
lsn't sugar better than vinegar?
come on .
we have a couple hours , baby .
let's go do something fun , you want to?
hey , how come you're the only man in this room that doesn't wanna fuck me?
what?
nicolas , where are you going?
i'm just going to buy some cigarettes .
don't worry , i'm not going anywhere while you have my balls in your pocket !
pack of cigarettes .
anything american .
hi .
what's your name?
hey , nicolas .
come here .
meet my friend napoleon .
oh , yeah .
i think he's in love .
can we just go outside?
i need to talk to you .
come on !
we're having fun .
just be cool .
i'm gonna go outside .
no !
nicolas .
we don't want you to wait out in the cold .
do we , napoleon?
i mean , if we hit it off
i thought of letting you off the hook .
really?
yeah .
you don't seem to be enjoying my company much .
maybe napoleon and i should sail off into the sunset ... ... and you can go fuck yourself .
i hope you didn't kill him .
he was gonna save me from a dip in the seine .
what?
we had big plans .
i was gonna go off the bridge into his boat .
big plans .
oh , poor lily , whatever happened to her?
she must have drowned and washed out to sea .
thanks a lot .
you've ruined everything .
fuck you .
what's the matter , nicolas?
don't i make you jealous?
jealous?
yes .
yes .
i was jealous .
i am jealous .
nicolas , you don't have to lick my ass .
just fuck me .
you know what?
what?
we can still go away .
both of us , together .
that's so sweet .
come here .
come here .
that's so romantic .
but without the money?
are you nuts?
yes .
that's a choice .
a bad choice .
there are other ones .
what , like doing the right thing?
that's a start .
i tried that once , nicolas .
and you know what it got me?
a lifetime of looking over my shoulder .
you know why no good deed goes unpunished?
because this world is hell , and you're nothing but a fucking patsy .
i made everybody think you kidnapped me ... ... so i could screw my husband out of 1 0 million bucks .
that's what it's all about .
me disappearing with 1 0 million bucks .
so wipe it off ... ... and let's go get it .
fuck you !
you're not gonna hurt her , right?
because i've done exactly what you've told me to do .
i brought the money ... ... and i haven't talked to anyone .
don't do anything foolish , darling .
i won't .
he just wants me to take the money and bring it back to him .
okay !
watts , it's nicolas bardo .
your wife is staging this kidnapping to take your $ 1 0 million .
lf you don't believe me , i got it right here on tape .
what the fuck do you think you're doing?
you killed him .
i was just being careful .
fucking bitch !
you didn't think i'd give you a gun loaded with real bullets , did you?
baby ... ... there's one more thing we gotta do .
oh , god !
somebody , help !
my husband .
fucking over everyone again?
but not this time .
where are the diamonds?
fuck you !
wake up , bitch !
before you die !
you know what's in this?
the bullet that's going to spread your brains all over that wall .
you know how i know?
look at me .
i'm your fucking fairy godmother ... ... and i just dreamt your future .
and mine too .
and all i know is ... ... if there's a chance of any of that shit happening , we're gonna change it here .
now listen .
i know you got a bad break , but you better forget it .
because if you can't ... ... then you may as well go ahead and pull the trigger .
but if you don't end it here ... ... and you get your ass on that plane to america ... ... your future will be sitting right next to you .
his name is bruce , and he's a really good guy .
he'll look into your eyes ... ... and he's gonna fall in love .
and after that , you're on your own .
so , what do you say?
do i pull the trigger?
or do you get your ass on that plane ... ... and have a wonderful life?
how do i know that you tell the truth?
how do i know there's a bullet in the chamber?
are you dodging bill collectors?
nick , asshole , it's johnny .
i know who you are .
what's up?
trying to catch lightning in a bottle .
are you eating?
barely .
like to make some real money?
what are you selling , john?
you know who bruce hewitt watts is?
the new american ambassador?
bingo .
he's got a wife and three kids , but no one has a picture of them .
maybe they're camera shy .
some people like to keep their home life private .
i know it's weird , but they do .
did you find fucking god?
you owe me , pal .
i guess i'll have to keep on owing you .
that's your half .
a little under 4 million .
four?
that's the best i could do .
i had to fence them off one at a time .
sorry that it took so long , but it was the safest way .
not bad for a night's work , huh?
you call that work?
bye , laure .
it's best if we don't see each other again .
excuse me , lady .
are you all right?
it was an accident , it was terr
sorry .
i'm just a little shook up .
actually , you look like you need a drink .
drink?
yes , come on .
i'm sorry ... ... you look so familiar .
have we met before somewhere?
only in my dreams .
