george , wake up .
it's saturday .
i know , but it's the first day of soccer .
it's our first game .
soccer?
i can't today .
i caught a cold while sleeping .
you'll be fine .
come on , come on , it'll be great .
we're going to play like brazilians .
here you go .
thanks , mom .
stuart , don't forget your water bottle .
george ....
don't forget your cleats .
you look especially beautiful today .
some people just know how to wear oatmeal .
okay , open up .
did you hear that?
she said " blah blah .
i can't believe it .
her first word .
where's the baby book?
i'm writing it down .
i'm not sure that's technically a word .
of course it is .
but your uncle crenshaw says that every little starts talking by nine months .
in uncle crenshaw's case , never stops .
are you both coming to the game?
wouldn't miss it .
frederick ... ... this soccer game's making me very ....
proud?
anxious .
especially about ....
i'm fine .
he's fine .
all those boys stomping around with cleats .
what if someone ....
oh , honey .
he's a little .
all littles are natural athletes .
do you need ....
could you?
okay , that's it for you .
snow , food .
food?
is it tuna?
or herring?
or , dare i say it , is it lox?
oh !
please be lox !
that's for you .
boys , are we ready to play some soccer?
you bet , dad .
oh , great .
it's glop .
look what i'm reduced to .
i'm a handi wipe with hair .
wallace !
get up !
there we go !
that's right !
dig !
dig !
go downfield !
downfield !
you guys , spread out !
spread out !
well , george is getting a workout .
what bothers me is that every kid has had a chance to play except stuart .
there's plenty of time .
plenty of time?
there's 40 seconds .
he did an excellent job of handing out the orange slices .
that's not as easy as it looks .
okay , i'm glad he's not in the game .
i don't want him to get hurt .
it's pee wee soccer .
nobody gets hurt .
irwin , are you okay?
are you all right , irwin?
do i look all right?
here .
come on .
better substitute .
tie game .
we could play with just 10 .
but we have george , so it's like having nine .
we'll have none of that .
come on , coach .
stuart !
go in for irwin !
mom !
dad !
i'm going in !
yeah , stuart !
oh , dear .
watch your tail out there .
don't worry , i won't let you down .
now , go get them .
let's go , let's go !
come on !
over here !
i'm open !
i got it !
i got it !
i'm going to snatch him off the field .
honey , honey .
knowing boys as i do , i think he might find that a little ....
embarrassing .
get it , george !
go after it !
pass me the ball , lame o .
come on .
george , shoot !
i got it !
i got it !
shoot !
i got it !
i got it !
yeah , i did it !
i have to start wearing a cup .
he just looked so small out there .
so lacking in bigness .
does he really have to go back next week?
we have to give him room to grow .
i do .
i let him slice his own banana .
with a spoon .
i let him drive his car to school .
no other mother does that .
with george walking beside him every step of the way .
how much more room should i give him?
a bit more than you're giving him now .
maybe mom was right .
maybe i shouldn't be playing soccer anymore .
what does she want you to go out for?
painting or dancing .
i guess it's my fault .
i'm sorry i kicked you into the goal .
that's okay .
you won the game .
that's the main thing .
no .
the main thing is i hit wallace in the face .
bogeys , 12 : 00 !
i got him , brooklyn !
wouldn't it be cool if i actually flew this?
yeah .
there's only one problem .
mom .
hello , mrs. little .
hi , will .
ls george home?
he's with stuart .
we just need to tighten her up and she's ready to fly .
hi , george .
hi , stuart .
hi , will .
you want to take a break for a while?
i brought my ps2 .
yeah , okay .
but what about the plane?
i want to play with will for a while .
play with snowbell .
oh , well .
guess i'll have to finish it myself .
if i can just ....
oh , dear .
hey , what's that noise?
sounds like a lawnmower .
inside the house?
stuart !
what are you doing?
i'm not doing anything !
pull the brake !
get the book !
this is cool .
all my brother does is jam crayons up his nose .
it says , " on takeoff , pull back on the throttle .
takeoff?
i'm in the air !
snowbell , get out of the way !
please , don't hurt me !
what's going on?
stuart's just flying in the house .
flying in the house?
at least he's indoors , nothing bad can happen .
watch out !
hit the dirt !
stuart !
duck !
are you all right?
are you okay?
i'm okay .
everything's fine .
fine?
stuart , you destroyed it .
i'm sorry i wrecked it , george .
i'm sure we can fix it with some glue .
no , we can't .
that's going in the trash .
it's much too dangerous .
thanks , stuart .
why don't you take the boys home?
i think stuart and i need to have a talk .
good idea .
come on , boys .
let's go home .
she treats me like a baby .
i'll fix you both some lunch .
she just loves you so much .
it's hard for her to think ofyou in danger .
oh , this has been a bad day .
mom's mad , george won't play with me ....
i know .
but every cloud has a silver lining .
doesn't that make them kind of heavy?
no , it's an expression , stuart .
the thing about being a little is that you can look at any situation ... ... no matter how bleak , how hopeless ... ... and still see the bright side .
the silver lining .
like in this situation , the silver lining would be ....
help me , dad , because i'm struggling .
george has found a newfriend .
so you could find a newfriend , too .
you're a lot better at this than i am .
i've been a little a lot longer than you have .
you'll get the hang of it .
meantime , keep your chin up ... ... your back straight and your heart open .
then what?
one step at a time .
and canada is separate from the united states because ... ... canadians like to be alone .
review tomorrow , test on friday .
and please take your leftover lunches with you .
my husband is tired of me coming home smelling like salami .
tony , would you like to come over to my house this afternoon?
sorry , pal .
i've got karate .
hey , mark .
guitar lessons .
some of the guys are going over to will's house to play basketball .
can i come?
they didn't exactly mention that you were invited .
oh , that's okay .
i'm busy anyway .
just tell mom i walked you home .
i owe you one .
sure .
whoa !
miss?
miss?
are you alive?
she's alive .
out of the way , please .
injured bird coming through !
what's going on?
my wing .
where am i?
hey !
where's the falcon?
what falcon?
that falcon !
drive !
get out of here !
oh , my !
get lost , you disgusting vulture !
eat my feathers , you vile buzzard !
do we really want to antagonize him?
oh , boy , we've got a problem .
no , you can make it .
don't slow down .
you did it .
yeah .
i did .
so , who do i have to thank?
forgive me .
my name is stuart .
stuart little .
i'm margalo .
just margalo .
margalo .
you're so strong .
are you an athlete?
well , yeah .
i play a little soccer ... ... fly airplanes ... ... race boats .
you can put me down now .
my legs are fine .
it's my wing that's hurt .
oh .
yeah .
of course .
there used to be bandages in here .
hey , why don't we try your scarf?
good idea .
my pin , it's ....
must have happened when that falcon smashed into me .
it was part of our nest when i was a baby .
i've had it my whole life .
it's the only thing i have left of my mother's .
gee , that's too bad .
yeah .
there .
how's that?
that's much better , thank you .
so tell me , stuart little , do you actually live here?
oh , yeah .
i'm a real little .
i'm the middle child .
the middle little .
cute .
so , where do you live?
you know , here and there .
you mean you don't have a home?
once , we lived in a box .
well , not really a box .
it was one of those things where people keep their jewelry .
a jewelry box?
yes !
that's what it must have been .
a jewelry box .
it was wonderful .
well , i've taken too much of your time .
i'd better go before it gets dark .
no , wait .
you can't go out there .
not while you're hurt .
you should stay here .
i couldn't impose .
i mean , you'd really do that for me?
sure , i have just the thing .
i'll be right back .
meanwhile , you can use my cat's bed .
you have a cat?
don't worry about snowbell .
he wouldn't hurt a fly .
those flies really come back on you .
i try to eat right and yet i still feel bloated .
maybe more food will help .
hi there .
sorry .
didn't mean to scare you !
scare me?
that's a laugh .
hear that?
that was a laugh .
hairball .
major hairball .
and yet we continue to lick ourselves .
unbelievable .
hey , snowbell .
meet margalo .
she'll be staying with us for a while .
staying?
are you out of your mind?
you can't just drag stray birds in here .
do you think this is a halfway house?
look , she's filthy .
no offense .
she could have germs .
and how do you know she's not a vagrant or a thief?
get rid of her .
we're home .
sorry we're late .
little hi , little low .
little hey , little ho .
what the heck was that?
that's just how we greet each other .
interesting .
nauseating is more like it .
you're in for it now , missy .
mother little hates when animals walk in here off the street .
when she sees this , she's going to throw a fit .
such a pretty little birdie .
maybe it's just my friends she hates .
i found her .
found me?
he saved my life .
he did?
from a falcon .
what's that?
stuart saved this little bird from a falcon .
a falcon?
they are fierce creatures .
why does the city have falcons?
that shouldn't be allowed .
write a letter .
on the other hand , we have a hero here .
way to go , stuart .
hey , dad .
what?
silver lining .
it's a guy thing .
is it?
isn't it nice that stuart has a friend?
i don't think stuart thinks of her as a friend .
what do you mean?
i mean he's smitten .
he's infatuated .
he's bedazzled .
but he's a baby .
boys start having crushes really young .
frederick , did you have many crushes?
i'm still having one .
so , margalo , can i get you anything else?
whip you up an omelet?
pop you a tart?
stuart , i'm full .
full?
you eat like a bird .
come on , stuart , time for school .
i'm not going to school .
i'm staying home to take care of margalo .
guess again .
you are going to school , and i'll take care of margalo .
look both ways crossing the street ... ... wear galoshes and , in art class , don't run with scissors .
i'll get your backpack .
mothers ....
you know .
well , i don't really know .
no?
see , my mom just kind of one day ... ... wasn't there anymore .
so you've been completely on your own all your life?
you bet .
i'll bet it's been scary .
no , it's been an adventure .
i wish i had some adventures .
i'm only allowed to paint .
hey , life is an adventure .
just walking out that door is an adventure .
come on , stu .
we're late .
go for it , kid .
the adventure begins .
that feels like enough adventure for one day .
hey , look !
the yankees won .
there we go .
can you say , " walk with mommy "?
mommy "?
walk "?
nothing .
martha and i are going out for a bit .
can i bring you anything?
no , thanks .
say , " bye bye , birdie .
say , " bye bye . " martha .
say , " bye bye , birdie .
fresh air .
remember me?
you scared me .
what can i say?
i'm a scary guy .
so , margalo , you case the joint?
any valuables?
come on , thrill me .
chill me .
they ain't got much .
the mom's got a ring , but it's only two carats .
all right , fine .
what else have they got?
well , you know , not that much .
i mean , they mostly just have each other .
a moment while i vomit .
why don't we just try somewhere else?
because you're set up here .
they trust you .
they like you .
and maybe ... ... you like them .
hey , margalo , come on .
don't con a conman .
nobody else ever invited me to live with them .
oh , really?
who found a pitiful orphan bird ... ... and plucked her out of the gutter?
who shared his food with her ... ... and , i hasten to add , taught her a trade?
who?
you did .
i did .
right .
well , then , straighten up and fly right .
and remember , you are here on business .
you're not here to play around .
come on , falcon !
when i'm on a job , i never play around !
are you cold?
i guess when the weather gets too cold , you'll just fly south for the winter?
well , to tell you the truth , i've never flown south .
it's kind of a dream of mine .
get out of this cold , windy city , catch that jet stream ....
fruit trees , millions of new birds to meet .
i hear it's paradise .
then how come you haven't gone?
something's always stopping me .
something's always stopping me , too .
everybody around here thinks i'm too small to accomplish anything .
hey , the way i see it , you're as big as you feel .
yeah .
boy , i'm really glad you fell into my car .
i mean , you know ....
i mean i'm not glad you fell .
i just ....
want some more popcorn?
okay .
what?
my pin .
it's fixed .
how
on my way home from school , i drive right past where you crashed .
it was no big deal .
i mean , there was finding it ... ... figuring out how the pieces fit together ... ... and you know , fixing it .
and no big deal .
just ...
oh , scottie . ... one , two , three .
good as new .
no , stuart , it's not .
it's much , much better .
stay with me .
all the time .
did you really think i wouldn't find out?
what are you talking about?
i'm talking about you and your little mouse friend .
big mistake !
never make a friend i can eat .
now , get me that ring !
or the mouse is lunch .
i'll do the dishes .
you did them last night .
for you , i'd do dishes every night .
that way , i don't have to change the baby .
she just dropped her dolly .
i'll just
frederick !
what?
my ring .
it's gone .
what do you mean?
it's gone !
are you absolutely ....
positive .
unless ....
i'll call the plumber !
what's going on?
mom's ring went down the drain .
i can't reach it .
hey !
what about me?
i can do it .
let me go , dad .
go where?
down the drain .
i can bring it back up .
it's an adventure .
i don't know .
it's awfully dark down there .
and smelly .
and cold .
but it's mom's ring .
she loves that ring .
come on , dad .
let me try .
now , if it gets too cold , or too scary ... ... you just tell us .
don't worry , dad .
i can handle it .
or yank on the string , we'll pull you up .
will do .
how's it so far?
wet .
there's a lot of slimy stuff all over the walls .
what does it look like?
like the inside of your nose .
can you see the bottom yet?
no , just more pipe .
and everything we ate for dinner last week .
and the pipe seems to go on and on .
well , the plumber said ....
what's going on?
is that a new top?
you know , you have such taste .
simple elegance is what i call it .
what's on the other end of that string?
this string?
yes .
well , now , don't get excited , but someone that you and i love ... ... has volunteered to go down the drain to get your ring .
stuart?
good guess , mom .
you let our son go down the kitchen drain?
now , eleanor , don't be upset .
it's been well thought out .
if there's a problem , i pull on the string and ....
now you can be upset .
are you okay?
can you hear me?
hurry !
i'm slipping .
get more string .
great .
there must be string here .
there is no more .
what else can we use?
spaghetti?
we're out of spaghetti .
well , do we have macaroni?
that's too short .
we can tie it together with  no .
hurry !
hang on , stuart !
margalo , what are you doing?
stuart , i'm coming !
grab on !
lower !
lower !
i got it !
are you all right?
are you hurt?
don't scare me like that .
margalo , you're the best friend i ever had .
what if someone had accidentally turned on the garbage disposal?
i would not have let that happen .
you let him go down the drain .
he wanted to go .
if martha wanted to go up the chimney ... ... or george wanted to go into the toilet , would you let them?
i love stuart as much as you do .
i just don't happen to be quite as ....
emotional?
irrational?
what were you going to say?
i forget .
i know i'm overprotective , it's just ... ... i can't stand the idea of stuart getting hurt .
i'm sorry , stuart .
what?
you people sure like your meat loaf .
you find the ring?
everything but .
has anyone seen margalo?
i can't find her anywhere .
maybe she just went for a walk or a little flight around the neighborhood .
sure , to strengthen her wing .
yeah , maybe .
but why'd she leave me her pin?
oh , you know , stuart ... ... margalo is kind of a free spirit .
maybe she just felt it was time to go .
without even saying goodbye?
what are you doing?
i think i know what happened .
i think that falcon got her .
yeah?
i'm going to find her .
and don't try to talk me out of it .
i've made up my mind .
are you crazy?
you can't go out there .
because i'm too small?
let me tell you something , you're as big as you feel .
then let me come with you .
no , i need you to stay and cover for me .
cover for you?
how?
make something up .
you're smart .
stuart , she's just a bird .
no , george , she's my friend .
and when you're friends with stuart little , you're friends for life .
well , ifyou won't let me come , at least get somebody to go with you .
snow !
the good silverware's in the dining room .
take anything , but don't hurt me .
it's me .
stuart .
you .
this better be important .
margalo's still missing .
i should've been more specific .
i meant important to me .
i'm going to look for her .
i hoped you'd come .
look , stuart , do yourself a favor .
buy a parakeet and forget her .
i can't forget her .
she's in terrible trouble and i have to help her .
i mean what am i , a man or a ... ... mouse?
is that a trick question?
it's important .
you got to help me .
and why would i do that?
well , because we're family ... ... and because i'd do the same for you .
and if you don't , and the littles ask where i am , george'll say you ate me .
what?
why you little rat !
you know something?
everybody thinks you're so nice .
you're not so nice .
come on !
it'll be fun .
it's an adventure .
hey !
mario andretti , slow down .
let's pace ourselves .
i'll have a heart attack .
i think i'm having a thrombosis and i don't even know what it means .
george !
stuart !
breakfast !
get it while it's hot .
say , " mama .
say , " dada .
say anything?
'morning , george .
where's stuart?
he already left .
he did?
without eating breakfast?
he had to get to school early ... ... because he's in a school play .
really?
yes .
he plays a mouse .
and they rehearse every morning before school .
why didn't he tell us?
he forgot .
you know , being worried about margalo .
right .
good .
this'll keep his mind off it .
got to go .
say , " oatmeal .
oh , boy .
this is a sign , stuart .
like the burning bush .
except it's a carburetor and i'm not moses .
but it's telling us something .
let your people go !
we're not giving up .
oh , why not?
giving up is fun .
and look at all the time you save .
i'm telling you , if more people gave up , there'd be fewer wars .
bill .
george .
hi , mom .
where's stuart?
he's not home?
oh , i just remembered .
he told me to tell you that he's rehearsing again .
at will's house .
and he's sleeping over there tonight .
sleepover?
on a school night?
hey , that's what he said .
got to go .
hello?
hey , will .
it's me , george .
if my mom calls , stuart's at your house , okay?
hold on a second .
hello?
will , hi .
it's mrs. little .
may i speak with stuart , please?
stuart?
you know , my son .
oh , stuart .
you mean now?
well , now is when i'm calling .
oh , he just went in the bathroom .
i think he'll be a while .
he brought a magazine .
well , then , is your mother there?
hold on a second .
i told her .
did she buy it?
yeah , but now she wants to speak to my mom .
what will i tell her?
make something up .
you're smart .
if i was smart , i wouldn't be in this situation .
she can't come to the phone right now .
she's in the bathroom , too .
but not the same bathroom !
just let her know i called .
thanks .
okay , mrs. little .
it's all clear .
i owe you one .
now will you tell me what's going on?
it's too complicated .
later .
little hi , little low .
little hey , little ho .
boys home?
well , george is .
but stuart is rehearsing his play .
then he's sleeping over at will's house .
he's going without george?
i think it'll give him room to grow .
oh , stuart , we've been walking for hours .
i can't take another step .
you know me , i hate to be negative .
but when i walk this much , i chafe .
also , i hate to bring this up ... ... but i need to go tinky .
how about the alley?
i'm a house cat .
we're fastidious creatures .
we don't just yell , " bomb's away ! " and go wherever we are !
oh , look , let's face it .
we'll never find her .
if only we knew someone who really knew the city .
yeah , someone who knows the city's disgusting underbelly .
who do i know that's disgusting?
don't threaten me !
what i could tell the health inspector ... ... would close you down in a new york minute !
monty !
snowbell !
what are you doing here?
we've been looking all over for you .
we need your help .
hey , snow , are you two still friends or can i eat him?
no , monty , you can't eat him .
please .
no !
now , pay attention .
what do you know about a bird called falcon?
falcon?
oh , that's a bad guy .
you don't want to fool with him .
where would we find him?
you don't want to find him .
you don't want anything to do with him .
trust me .
he'd eat you so fast you'd be falcon poop before you could yell for help .
falcons are vicious .
they grab you by your neck and carry you so high , you can't even see the ground .
then they drop you .
and when you land , they drink what's left through a straw .
snowbell , are you all right?
oh , yeah .
i no longer need a litter box .
mop up on aisle three .
stu , listen .
this whole thing has been a groove and a gas ... ... but it's important to know when the fun's over .
you don't want to be that last pathetic person who leaves a party .
i told you .
i'm not giving up .
we're going to find the falcon .
all right , then .
it's your funeral .
okay , listen .
listen carefully .
the falcon lives across the park ... ... at the very tiptop of the pishkin building .
not many people go up there .
and even fewer return .
well , here we are , snowbell .
this is it .
salmon , catfish , tuna .
why do they taunt me?
how can you think of food at a time like this?
stay on track , will you?
i'm nervous .
when i'm nervous , i eat .
because i know in my growling gut if anything happens to you , i'll be blamed .
i'm sure they already know we're gone and plan to replace me with a hamster .
don't worry .
george has us covered .
george?
george doesn't know poop from applesauce .
and i say that with a great deal of affection .
hello , little residence .
oh , george .
i'm glad you answered .
who is it?
can you speak louder?
george , it's me , stuart .
where are you?
how are you?
did you find her?
are you all right?
how's snowbell?
when'll you be home?
mom and dad are asking lots of questions .
so are you .
i only have a second .
i just want you to know that we're on the trail ... ... and with any luck , we'll be home by dinner .
and , george ...
... thanks for covering for me .
sure .
but where are you?
now , listen closely .
we're at the pishkin building .
please deposit $0 . 35 for the next five minutes .
snowbell , i need more change .
what do i look like , a fanny pack?
are you still there?
is that stuart?
let me think .
yeah .
i thought he was coming home .
he is .
later .
he and will just need to rehearse some more .
in fact , i just left him at will's .
hello , mrs. little .
is george home?
will , i found it !
found what?
the calculator .
the calculator?
will , where's stuart?
it's okay .
she knows about the play .
it's supposed to be a surprise .
i had to tell her so she'd know stuart's at your house .
we're going back there .
oh , yeah .
right .
it's going to be great .
i just need to get the calculator?
to figure out how long to rehearse .
it's a very complicated play .
come on .
let's go .
see you later , mrs. little .
george , don't forget you two have a soccer game later .
we'll meet you there !
i can't handle this .
i'm too stressed .
all this lying .
i've never lied before .
that's why she believes you .
boy , are we in trouble .
" we "?
yeah , " we . " he didn't spend the night rehearsing at my house .
what are you planning to do , mighty mouse , scale the wall?
i'll think of something .
so long , snowbell !
you've got guts , kid .
guts and spunk .
not to mention moxie .
you've got guts , spunk and moxie .
okay .
here we go .
all right , falcon .
hand her over and nobody gets hurt .
you up here?
is anybody here?
i'm here .
i came for my friend margalo .
lfyou've hurt her , i'll
you'll what?
tell me right now .
is she all right?
why not ask her yourself , whiskers?
margalo , run !
fly away while i've got him covered .
what are you waiting for?
this kid's priceless .
tell me , cheese face , does this sound familiar?
oh , my wing .
i don't think i can fly .
what are you talking about?
i can't drill through the wood .
she scammed you .
she played you like a harp .
margalo , what does he mean?
okay , now it's getting sad .
maybe this will clear things up .
my mom's ring .
i'm so sorry .
i never wanted to hurt you .
but , margalo , why?
don't be upset , mouse boy .
she has conned smarter than you .
or did you think you were special?
a real friend?
i didn't lie about that , stuart .
you are my friend .
then come with me .
she's not going anywhere .
oh , yes , she is .
was that your best shot?
now , let me show you mine .
don't hurt him , falcon !
i won't hurt him .
the sidewalk will !
can't we talk this over?
no !
stuart !
let me go !
no , falcon !
a few days in here should provide you with an attitude adjustment .
what have i done?
i'll bet something terrible has happened .
the littles will kill me .
i know , i'll bring home another mouse in a snazzy outfit ... ... teach him to drive a sports car and pass him off as stuart .
who am i kidding?
i have to get up there .
but how?
i hope i live to regret this .
stuart?
yoo hoo?
come out , come out wherever you are .
please don't jump out from behind anything .
remember , i have a strong stomach but a very weak heart .
here , mousie mousie .
snowbell?
is that you?
is that really you?
margalo?
where are you?
ln the can .
oh , okay .
i'll wait .
no , in the paint can .
why are you in there?
is this some kind of trick?
just get me out .
is stuart in there , too?
no , snowbell , he's dead .
what?
stuart is dead?
falcon killed him .
no .
he can't be , he's ....
i was supposed to protect him .
i wish it was me who had been killed .
really?
no .
but i am very unhappy !
oh , dear .
i'm dumped on a boat .
i'm on a garbage barge .
i got to get off .
hello there !
i'm over here !
on the barge !
can you hear me?
help !
i'm not supposed to be here !
i need to get off !
help me !
help !
rita , hi .
i was in the neighborhood .
i thought i'd get the boys .
george and will?
george and stuart .
george is here , but i haven't seen stuart .
but he slept here last night .
no .
george !
what are you going to do now?
which way's canada?
this is terrible .
i just want to go home .
i know a little is supposed to always see a silver lining .
maybe this means i'm not really a little .
maybe i'm just stuart nobody .
stuart nothing .
there is no silver lining !
oh , no .
what have i done?
my plane .
my plane !
the silver lining !
this is it !
all right , george , where is he?
and this time , the truth .
i'm not sure .
it is never okay to lie to your parents .
is it okay to break a promise to your brother?
it's wrong to promise your brother you'll lie to your parents .
listen to the tone of my voice .
tell us where stuart is .
it was a promise .
brother to brother .
george , i understand .
i have a brother .
but if he was in danger , that would matter more to me than the promise .
how would we all feel if anything happened to stuart?
he's at the pishkin building .
dad .
what?
am i in trouble?
no , son .
you're in big trouble .
mom , dad , i'm really sorry .
you should be .
for all we know , stuart could be out there now , lying face down with his
or , he could be fine .
we don't have to assume the worst .
after all , it's not the little way .
yes , you're right .
he could be puttering home right now in his shiny little car .
smiling and happy .
his whiskers fluttering in the breeze .
mom .
yes , george .
i don't think he's puttering home .
who would do this?
tiny little vandals .
that miserable falcon !
from this day forward , i vow revenge .
if that falcon were here right now , i'd rip his throat out .
i'd scratch his face off .
i'd
that's him .
don't hurt me .
kill the bird , not me .
i'm going to be falcon poop .
well , well , well .
the canary is out of her cage .
and how nice .
she's brought a friend for dinner .
too bad i don't like canned food .
snowbell , get out !
can't .
stuck .
too fat !
don't do it , falcon .
or else !
do what?
what's he doing?
or else what?
or else you'll lose this .
put that down , margalo .
i'm through doing what you tell me to do .
i'm leaving you , falcon , forever .
oh , and what do you think you'll be without me?
free .
big mistake .
i'll be back for you , fur ball .
don't hurry !
stuart !
you're alive !
so far !
where'd you get the plane?
a garbage dump .
sorry i asked .
i hope we're not too late .
keep your eyes peeled .
he could be anywhere .
careful now .
one step at a time .
that's it .
you're going to make it .
yeah !
i'm alive .
i'm alive .
stuart !
is that you?
take me with you !
what about me?
how will i get down from here?
i think this is it .
turn here .
okey dokey .
no problem .
hey , look !
it's stuart .
stop the car !
stuart !
look at that bird .
he's bigger than me .
we got to save him .
come on .
it's the littles .
i'm saved !
wait !
it's me !
follow that flying mouse .
no problem .
hey little , ho little ... ... hoo little , hey hottle , ho wottle , wo wittle .
there he is !
if we get out of this , i'm sticking to painting and dancing .
hey , lady !
get out of the way !
he's closing in .
oh , my goodness .
keep it running .
okey dokey .
no problem .
he can't hear you .
i think we lost him .
going up?
frederick , i feel so helpless .
a mouse needs to know his limitations .
stuart !
pull up !
i can't !
it's stuck !
well , try harder !
margalo !
get out !
save yourself !
no , stuart !
if we go , we go together !
stuart !
pull up !
pull up , stuart !
stuart , pull up !
you should've stayed in your little hole , mouse boy .
stuart , we can't outrun him .
then we'll just have to face him .
it's too dangerous .
i won't let you do it .
but i have to try .
i'll be back for you later .
what do you mean?
stuart !
don't do it !
party's over , fur face .
what's he doing?
they'll crash !
stuart !
turn !
run away !
bye bye , birdbrain !
oh , dear .
got you .
can't i get a decent meal in this city?
thank you .
stuart !
are you okay?
i am now .
margalo saved me .
we saved each other .
what did you think you were doing?
you almost gave me a heart attack .
i'm sorry , mom .
you ran away from home .
i know .
and you had george lie to us .
yeah .
then why am i so proud of you?
mrs. little , this belongs to you .
my ring .
yeah , i took it .
and now she's giving it back .
i'm just happy to have all ofyou back .
snowbell !
you made it .
thank goodness you're all right .
snowbell , where have you been?
you wouldn't believe what stuart and margalo have been through .
you should have seen it .
these two were so brave .
let's go home .
and how about me?
i played no part in this?
well , i have had enough !
i'm staying right here , folks !
oh , yeah .
you'll never see me again !
snow , want some tuna when we get home?
tuna?
i love these people .
wait !
wait for me !
i guess they're flying south for the winter?
i guess .
you've always dreamed of going , haven't you?
but falcon never let you .
every year i'd just watch all the other birds go .
the ones who were free .
you're free .
we'd be so far apart .
it wouldn't change a thing .
well ....
you're sure of the way?
we can call aaa .
we can get you maps , discount coupons .
there's a place in south carolina where they do the best pecan pie .
i'm a bird .
instinct should take over .
i guess you've waited for this a long time .
all my life .
only ....
only what , dear?
well , now it's not just talk .
now , it's the real thing .
are you scared?
the world's pretty big , and i'm pretty small .
somebody once told me , " you're as big as you feel .
just spread your wings ... ... and soar .
i'll miss you , stuart .
i'll miss you , too .
i'll miss all ofyou .
you , too , snowbell .
i'm not going to cry .
little hi , little low .
little hey , little ho .
stuart?
yeah , dad?
what's the silver lining this time?
she'll be back in the spring .
bye bye , birdie .
did you hear that?
her first words !
she spoke !
of course she did .
i knew she could do it .
big deal .
when she can fall from a tree and land on her feet , then i'll be impressed .
