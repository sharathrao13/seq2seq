he already thinks you're out of your mind .

no , thelma , i don't give a shit what we have for dinner .
i may not even make it home for dinner .
you know how fridays are .
funny how so many people want to buy a carpet on a friday night .
you'd almost think they'd want to forget about it for the weekend .
well , then , it's a good thing ... ... you're not regional manager ... ... and i am .
for christ's sake ... ... l got to get 'em the hell out of here .
jesus !

all right !
i'll be there around 2 : 00 or 3 : 00 .
okay .
hey , what kind of stuff do i bring?
i don't know .
warm stuff , i guess .
it's the mountains , i guess it gets cold at night .
i'm just gonna bring everything .
okay , i will , too , then .
and steal darryl's fishing stuff .
louise , i don't know how to fish .
neither do i , but darryl does it .
how hard can it be?
i'll see you in a bit .
okay .
bye .
hi , this is jimmy .
i'm not here right now
hi .
no .
we don't need the lantern .
the place has electricity .
no , i want to take , just in case .
in case of what?
in case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose , who ... ... cuts the electricity off ... ... and tries to come in and kill us .
sure , thelma .
well then , that lantern'll come in real handy .
we should just tow your car behind , too ... ... in case he steals the spark plugs .
we'd have to .
that thing barely makes it down the driveway .
careful .
all right , everything in?
here you go .
be careful .
smile .
sit down !
would you take care of this gun?
what in the hell'd you bring that for?
come on .
psycho killers , or bears , or snakes .
i don't know how to use it .
will you take care of it?
put it away .
here , put it in my purse .
thelma , good lord .
so , whose place is this again?
it's bob's , the day manager's .
he's gettin 'a divorce and his wife's gettin 'this place ... ... so he's lettin 'all his friends use it till he's got to turn over the keys .
i've never been out of town without darryl .
how come darryl let you go?
'cause i didn't ask him .
shit .
thelma !
he's gonna kill you !
well , he'd never let me go .
he never lets me do one goddamn thing , that's any fun .
all he wants me to do is ... ... hang around the house while ... ... he's out doing god only knows what .
well , you get what you settle for .
i left him a note .
i left him stuff to microwave .
thelma .
thelma , what are you doin '?
smoking .
hey , i'm louise .
i'll never make it .
can't we just stop somewhere , for a minute?
thelma , we're not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is .
then , what difference would it make if we stopped .
come on , i never get to do stuff like this .
okay .
but it's gonna be a quick stop .
fine .
i haven't seen a place like this since i left texas .
isn't this fun?
you all want a drink?
no , thanks .
i'll have a wild turkey straight up , and a coke back , please .
thelma !
what , tell me something .
is this my vacation or isn't it?
i mean , god , you're as bad as darryl .
i'm sorry , it's just i'm not used to seeing you this way .
i haven't seen you this way in a while .
you're usually so sedate .
well , i've had it up to my ass with sedate !
you said you and me was gonna get out of town and ... ... for once , just really let our hair down .
well , darling , look out 'cause my hair is coming down .
all right .
i changed my mind .
i'm gonna have a margarita ... ... and a shot of cuervo on the side .
all right !
what are a couple of kewpie dolls like you doin 'in a place like this?
we left town  minding our own business .
'cause we wanted to have some fun .
louise here is mad at her boyfriend ...
we wanted something to eat .
you come to the right place .
you like chili?
they got good chili .
harlan , you botherin 'these poor girls?
hell , no , i was just bein 'friendly .
well , it's a good thing they're not all as friendly as you .
hey , your name's harlan?
i got an uncle named harlan .
you do?
is he a funny uncle?
'cause if he is , then he and i got something in common .
i don't mean to be rude ... ... but i got something i got to talk to my friend about in private .
i understand .
i didn't mean to bother you .
it's just hard not to notice two such pretty ladies as yourselves .
you better dance with me before ... ... you leave , or i will never forgive you .
sure , that'd be fun .
jeez , louise , that wasn't very nice .
can't you tell when somebody's hittin 'on you .
so what if he was?
it's all your years of waiting table has made you jaded ... that's all .
maybe .
just relax , will you?
you're making me nervous .
all right !
that's a good band .
wonder if darryl's home yet .
wonder if jimmy's got back .
why don't you just tell him to get lost once and for all?
why don't you ditch that no good husband of yours?
this one's on harlan .
thanks .
well , look , jimmy'll come in off the road and you won't be there ... ... and he'll freak out and call you like a hundred thousand times and ... ... sunday night you'll call him back ... ... and by monday he'll be kissin 'the ground you walk on .
exactly .
in the meantime , you said we was gonna have some fun .
so let's have some !
all right .
okay .
let's dance .
all right !
thelma .

i love it .

please don't hurt me , harlan !
goddamned bitch .
don't hurt me , harlan !
let her go !
get the fuck out of here .
you let her go , you fucking asshole ... ... or i'm gonna splatter your ugly face all over this nice car .
all right .
hey , just calm down .
we were just having a little fun , that's all .
looks like you got a real fucked up idea of fun .
come on .
turn around .
in the future ... ... when a woman's crying like that ... ... she isn't having any fun !
bitch !
i should've gone ahead and fucked her !
what did you say?
i said suck my cock .
my god .
get the car .
jesus christ .
louise , you shot him .
my god .
get the car .
you watch your mouth , buddy .
louise !
come on !
watch it , you fucking asshole !
louise .
louise , where are we going?
i don't know .
just shut up so i can think .
shouldn't we go to the cops?
i think we ought to tell the police .
tell 'em what?
just what do you think we should tell 'em , huh?
i don't know .
just tell 'em what happened .
which part?
all of it .
that he was raping me .
a hundred people saw you dancin 'cheek to cheek with him all night !
who's gonna believe that?
we don't live in that kind of a world .
goddamn it , pull over !
all right .
thelma , i'm gonna ... ... stop someplace for a cup of coffee ... ... and then , just for a second , and then i'm gonna ... ... get it together .
and we'll ... ... figure out then what to do .
and everything's gonna be fine , all right?
everything's gonna all right?
now is not the time to panic .
if we panic now , we're done for .
nobody saw it .
nobody knows it was us .
so , we're still okay .
we just have to figure out what we're gonna do next .
we just have to figure out ... ... what we're gonna do .
i'll say one thing .
this is some vacation .
i sure am having a good time .
this is real fun .
if you weren't concerned with having so much fun ... ... we wouldn't be here now .
what is that supposed to mean?
it just means shut up , thelma .
so this is all my fault , is it?
i have to go to the bathroom .
sorry .
thanks , i'll try again later .
move back , people .
stand away from the line , please .
no , it's secured until further notice .
could you identify 'em if you saw them again?
hell , i told you 50 times .
yeah , i could identify 'em , but neither one of those two ... ... is the type to pull somethin 'like this .
you're not exactly an expert witness but what makes you so sure?
if waiting tables in a bar don't make you ... ... an expert on human nature , nothin 'will .
i coulda told you harlan puckett was ... ... gonna end up buyin 'it in a parking lot .
i'm just surprised it didn't happen sooner than this .
who do you think did it?
has anybody asked his wife?
i hope she did it .
lena , do you have any ideas or don't you?
well , if i had to guess i'd say it was ... ... some old gal , some old gal's husband .
but it wasn't neither one of those two .
the smaller one ... ... the one with the tidy hairdo ... ... she left me a huge tip .
you didn't notice what kind of car they were driving , did you?
it's a nightclub , hal , not a drive in .
i don't follow the customers out to the parking lot .
all right?
lena , go on home .
you kept me here all night to ask me the same ol 'question ... ... over and over again .
ain't you gonna offer me some teeny eeny , witty bitty little drink?
behave yourself .
neither of those two was the murdering type , hal .
hi , this is jimmy
thelma , you in there?
thelma come on !
we're out of here , thelma !
we're gonna need money .
how much money you have?
what?
i'm gonna stop at the next town .
we'll get a motel room .
i can rest for a little bit and then i'll figure out what to do .
okay .
wait , i'm looking .
$61 .
shit .
$41 .
we're gonna need more money .
what are you doing?
why are you unpacking?
you said we was just gonna take a nap .
well , i'm trying to figure out what to do .
well , when you figure it out just wake me up .
what the hell's wrong with you?
what's that supposed to mean?
why are you acting like this?
acting like what?
how am i supposed to act?
excuse me for not knowin 'how to act when you blow somebody away !
help me to figure out what to do .
i'm trying to figure out what to do .
but you could try to help me .
i did !
i had a suggestion that we go to the police .
but you didn't like that .
frankly , i'm out of ideas .
what's the big rush?
if we give 'em enough time , they'll come to us .
i'm sorry .
i'm just not ready to go to jail yet .
why don't you ... ... go out to the pool and take a swim or something ... ... all right?
now , i'll figure out what to do .
jimmy , this is louise .
i've been trying to call you .
hey , baby .
hi .
where the hell are you?
are you all right?
i'm fine .
how are you?
long time no see .

louise , now just tell me what the hell's going on here .
i come back , nobody knows where you are .

i have about $6, 700 in the bank .
now , i know you can't get it out .
but i need that money .

you call me back and i'll tell you which office to go to .
all right .
i'll call you back in an hour .
thelma !
what?
get in the car .
even if they didn't do it , they most likely witnessed it ... ... so somebody better talk to 'em .
put out an apb , and see what we get back .
any reason to believe they've left the state?
that's certainly possible .
hal , why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this?
louise , don't get mad , okay?
but where are we going?
oklahoma city .
jimmy's gonna wire me some money
jimmy?
did you talk to him?
did you tell him?
is he mad?
no , and that's what we gotta get straight now .
darryl's been calling , mad as a hornet ... ... making all kinds of noise .
when you call him ... ... you gotta ... ... not tell him anything about this .
make sure everything sounds real normal .
i called the asshole at four o'clock in the morning .
he wasn't even home .
i don't know what he's got to be mad about .
i'm the one that should be mad .
thelma ... ... i'm going to mexico .
i figure i can make it in ... ... two and a half days , but i'm gonna have to haul ass .
are you up to this?
i mean , i gotta know .
this isn't a game .
i'm in deep shit and i gotta know what you're gonna do .
i don't know ... ... l don't know , louise , i mean ... ... l don't know what you're asking .
now , don't you start flaking out on me !
goddamn it , every time that we get in trouble you just get blank or ... ... plead insanity or some such shit .
not this time .
i mean , this time things have changed .
everything's changed .
but i'm goin 'to mexico .
i'm goin '.
louise?
is that the way you answer the phone?
i was afraid i missed you .
i got it .
i was afraid i couldn't get a check cashed on saturday .
who did it?
friend of mine who owns a club .
doug randall .
you didn't tell him what it was for?
no , i didn't say what it was for .
i told him i was buyin 'a car .
good .
that's real good .
listen , where do i go?
it's a place called the vagabond motel .
it's at 1921 north east 23rd .
it's under " peaches .
what?
that's the code word .
i miss you , peaches .
thanks , jimmy .
i appreciate it .
ma'am , you sure you wouldn't rather have the large economy size?
no , that's okay .
what are you lookin 'at?
i want you to call darryl .

i don't know .
i won't .

why , yes , i will , operator .
thelma , where in the sam hill are you?
i'm with louise .
we're in the mountains , fishin '.
have you lost your mind?
is that it?
i leave for work , and you take complete leave of your senses?
darryl , calm down , please .
don't get so mad .
i can explain , okay?
you see , louise
hold on .
now , come on , pick it !
shit .

we're just gonna stay there , fish and hang out and stuff and ... ... we'll be gone one more day .
we'll be home tomorrow night .
no , you won't .
you'll be back today .
now , you get your butt back here , thelma , now ...
goddamn it !
darryl , you're my husband ... ... not my father .
that louise is nothin 'but a bad influence .
if you're not back here by tonight ...
thelma ... ... well then , i just don't wanna say .
darryl?
thelma?
go fuck yourself .
that's good , that's just sweet .
shit !
darling , you all right?
are you okay?
did i cause it?
no , i'm sorry .
you're okay?
is there something i can do for you?
no , it's okay .
crazy women .
excuse me , ma'am .
may i ask what direction you're headed?
i'm trying to get back to school , my ride fell through ...
i'm kinda stuck here like stink on stink .
so , i was thinking , if you're goin 'my way or ... ... if i'm going your way ...
i think we're going to oklahoma city .
but i'm not sure .
yeah , well , i'd appreciate it much .
well , see , it's really not up to me .
it's not my car .
we'd have to ask my friend .
but , she'd probably say no .
she's a little bit uptight .
maybe it's not such a good idea .
but , i thank you for your time .
but , you know , i can ask .
it wouldn't hurt .
well , no , it wouldn't hurt .
hey , louise .
this young man here's on his way back to school ... ... and i thought since we're going in the same direction ... ... we could give him a ride , huh?
it's probably not a good idea .
no , probably not , but i appreciate your time .
you all have a good day .
drive safe .
did you see how polite he is?
he was sweet .
what?
bye .
fill 'er up .
sure wish we could have brought him with us .
what'd darryl have to say?
he said , " okay thelma ...
... l just wanted to make sure you was all right .
i sure hope you're havin 'fun .
you deserve it ...
... after all you put up with me .
i love you honey .
so , how long before we're in goddamn mexico?
i just didn't think it would hurt to give somebody a ride .
did you see his butt?
darryl don't have a cute butt .
you could park a car in the shadow of his ass .
i'm sorry .
i'm just not in the mood for company right now .
here , take this map .
i need you to find ... ... all the secondary roads to mexico from oklahoma city .
i think we should stay off the interstate .
we're too conspicuous .
looks like we could get on this road 81 here ... ... and head down towards dallas .
no , i don't want to go through texas .
find some way we don't have to .
wait .
what?
you want to go to mexico from oklahoma ... ... but you don't want to go through texas?
you know how i feel about texas !
we're not goin 'that way !
i know , louise , but we're running for our lives .
i mean , can't you make an exception?
look at this map .
the only thing between oklahoma ...
... and mexico is texas .
i'm not gonna talk about this .
you find another way or give me the goddamn map and i will .
do you understand?
no , louise , i don't .
now , how come you never told me what happened to you there?
look , you shoot off a guy's head ... ... with his pants down , texas is not ... ... the place you wanna get caught .
now , trust me .
now , i'm not gonna talk about this anymore .
happy birthday , lady .
is the manager in?
marian , there's a police officer here .
all right , thelma .
all right .
okay .
the other night there was a murder out at the silver bullet .
a man was shot .
and we have some witnesses that saw a 1966 ... ... t bird convertible leaving the scene .
sort of speeding out of the driveway there .
and that vehicle is registered to one louise sawyer .
now we have reason to believe that your wife was the other occupant .
what?
excuse me .
you're standing in your pizza .
oh !
shit !
so tell me something , ms. thelma .
how is it that you ain't got any kids?
i mean god gives you somethin 'special , i think you ought to pass it on .
well , darryl , that's my husband ...
darryl .
yeah , he says he's not ready yet .
says he's still a kid himself .
kinda prides himself on being infantile .
he's got a lot to be proud of .
louise and him don't get along .
well , that's putting it mildly .
she thinks he's a pig .
i know he's a pig .
did you get married real young , ms. thelma .
well , i guess 18's kinda young .
but we'd already been going out for four years when we got married .
out for how long?
four years .
i never been with anybody but darryl .
oh , i'm sorry .
if you don't mind me saying so ... ... he sounds like a real asshole .
it's okay .
he is an asshole .
but most of the time i just let it slide .
you better slow down there , ms. louise .
that's a cop up ahead .
maybe you got a few too many parking tickets .
we'll take you to oklahoma city and then you best be on your way .
all right?
all right .
prints on the trunk of the car match those of thelma dickinson .
i'll be damned .
isn't that strange?
and the husband says a gun is missing .
she took a lot of stuff .
it looks like she maybe planned on being gone a while .
the strange thing is ... ... her husband said she would never touch that gun .
he got it for her 'cause he's out late a lot ... ... but he said she'd never touch it ... ... wouldn't learn to shoot it .
just kept it in a drawer for years .
what kind of gun was it?
38 .
where are they?
they were on their way to some guy's cabin ... ... and they never showed up .
all right .
now i'm gonna go in
listen up , you two , i'm gonna go in ... ... it's just gonna take a minute .
you two better say your good byes .
i'm here to pick up a money order for louise sawyer .
there's nothing .
how about " peaches "?
could you try code word " peaches "?
did i hear somebody say " peaches "?
my god .
jimmy .
that's the secret word .
show the lady what she won , don .
what are you doin 'here?
i just came to see you , baby .
can i have another room , please?
put it on my credit card .
thelma , get your foot down .

good answer .
same goes double for me .
who's the cowboy?
oh , this here ... this is j. d.
he's a student .
we're just giving him a ride to here .
and then he , louise said that he would have to go so ... ... l guess that's where he's going to .
he's going .
i reckon that's what i'm doing .
he's gone .
have a good trip .
thank you .
nice meeting you .
that's him goin '.
i love watchin 'him go .
thelma kinda took to him .
well , we got you a room there , thelma .
go on in and take yourself a nice cold shower .
well , you know me , jimmy , i'm just a wild woman .
it's our future .
what're you gonna tell him?
nothin '.
i'm not gonna tell him a thing .
the least i can do is not make him any more of an accessory than he is .
you are so sweet to that guy .
you know , you really are .
imagine not wantin 'to drag him into this .
i didn't ask him to come .
it's like i said , it's no different than any other guy .
he just loves the chase , is all .
he's sure got his work cut out for him now , don't he?
thelma , just put a lid on it !
now ... ... l want you to just , you guard that money .
okay .
and if there's any problem ... ... then you call me in room 21 1 .
i won't wait up .
you want a drink?
no .
why don't you tell me what's goin 'on?
i'm not gonna tell you what's goin 'on .
someday soon you'll understand why i can't ... ... but i'm not goin 'to , so don't ask me .
can i ask you one thing?
maybe .
are you in love with somebody else?
does this have somethin 'to do with another man?
no , it's not anything like that .
all right , what is it , goddamn it?
were you just gonna leave for fucking ever? !
what , did you fuckin 'kill somebody?
when you start this shit , i'm outta here !
i'm sorry .
why don't you come back over here and sit down ... ... and i wanna give you somethin '.
i'm fine right here .

why don't you try it on?
well , you didn't see that one comin ', did you?
why , jimmy?
why , now?
try not to get too excited , louise .
i just ... ... flew across two states with that ring in my fuckin 'hand and ... ... you know i hate to fly .
you came all this way ... ... because you thought i was with somebody else .
no , that's not why i came .
because , you know , i don't want to lose you .
and i get the feeling like you're gonna like split .
permanently .
that's not a good reason to get married .
well , i thought that's what you wanted .
i did .
but not like this .
louise?
no , thelma , it's me .
surprise .
i was just out there and i was just thinking that ... ... l know i'm supposed to be gone and all but ... ... you know .
and i'm not havin 'a turd's luck getting a ride out in this rain .
i was just thinkin 'about you .
this is crazy .
i'm gonna get out of your hair , all right?
well .
wait .
where you goin '?
ah , i don't know .
you know .
nowhere .
you think i'm happy playin 'my one night gigs ... ... in ramada inn lounges?
you think you're the only one with dreams that don't work out?
we both got what we settled for .
i think maybe you just don't love me anymore .
no , i do love you .
but i think it's time to just ... ... let go of the old mistakes .
just chalk it up to ... ... bad timin '.
i think it's time to let go .
again .
come on .
you're too easy .
come on .
all right , i'll do it .
here we go .
well , don't leave 'em , just leave 'em there .
you see , this is an unfair advantage .
you got ... too much metal goin 'here .
you want to lighten the load a little bit?
i think that's better .
what do you think?
yeah , okay .
take me , break me , make me mad !
watch your head .
careful .
oh , my head's fine .
who are you , anyway?
i'm the great and powerful oz .
who do you want to be?
tell me , i know you're not just some schoolboy .
nobody ever tells me shit .
oh , i'm just some guy .
guy whose parole officer ... ... is probably havin 'a shit fit right about now .
what do you mean , parole officer?
what?
are you a criminal?
no , not no more , thelma .
let's see , besides bustin 'parole i haven't done one wrong thing .
what'd you do?
i'm a robber .
you're a bank robber?
no .
i don't rob no banks .
come on .
what'd you rob?
well , let's see .
let's add it up here , i ... ... robbed a gas station ... ... a couple of convenience stores , liquor stores .
oh , my god .
how?
come on .
see , first you pick your place , all right?
then i just sit back and i watch it for a while .
wait for that right moment to make my move , see?
that's somethin 'you gotta know up here ... ... that shit cannot be taught .
yeah , then ... ... l don't want to talk about this .
come on .
i do .
all right .
then i'd ... ... waltz right in , yep ... ... and i'd just kinda waltz on in and i'd say ... ... " ladies .
gentlemen .
let's see who wins the prize for keepin 'their cool .
everybody down on the floor .
now , nobody loses their head , then nobody loses their head .
you , sir .
you do the honors .
take that cash and put it in that bag there ...
... and you got an amazing story to tell your friends .
if not , well , you got a tag on your toe .
you decide .
it's as simple as that .
then i'd just slip on out .
and , get the hell out of dodge , yeah .
my goodness .
you were sure gentlemanly about it .
i've always believed that done properly ... ... armed robbery doesn't have to be an unpleasant experience .
what?
you're a real live outlaw , aren't you?
i may be an outlaw , darlin ', but ... ... you're the one stealin 'my heart .
oh , smooth .
oh , you're smooth .
isn't he?
i sure am .

what happened?
tell me what you said .
i said you had a nice pair of eyes .
and what'd i say?
do you remember?
you shut 'em .
asked me if i knew what color they were .
and what'd you say?
i didn't know .
jimmy , what color are my eyes?
they're brown .
wait .

thank you .
look , i don't know what's goin 'on with you , or what happened , or ... ... what you all did ... ... but i'm not gonna tell anybody anything and i'm not gonna ... ... say that i even saw you .
what'd you do?
take some kind of pill , makes you say all the right stuff?
i'm chokin 'on it .
you sure you don't want me to go with you?
i think it's probably not a real good idea right now .
but i'll catch up with you later .
on down the road .
well ...
my taxi's here .
why don't you just keep that?
thanks .
i just want you to be happy .

i'd just die if we got caught over a speeding ticket .
you know , for the first time in my life i wish this car wasn't green .
you sure we should be drivin 'like this?
in broad daylight and everythin '?
no , we shouldn't , but i want to put some distance between us ... ... and the scene of our last goddamn crime !
oh , man , you wouldn't have believed it .
it was like i'd been doin 'it all my life .
i mean , nobody would believe it .
think you found your callin '?
maybe .
the call of the wild !
you are disturbed !
yeah !
i believe i am .
thelma .
don't you litter .
wait a minute .
shit .
god , i hate when you
this always happens when you're in a hurry .
damn .
what are you gonna do?
just stay drunk all day?
try to .
oh , isn't that nice?
truck drivers are always so nice .
best drivers on the road .
look .
how original .
hey , hi .
thank you .
oh , man , that's disgustin '!
oh !
you pig !
you pig !
just a fucking pig !
that's gross .
what's he gotta do that for?
oh !
i don't know .
they think we like it .
they think it turns us on .
shut up !
james lennox?
yeah , who wants to know?
arkansas state police .
hi .
thelma !
what?
i want you to call darryl .
what for?
i want you to find out if he knows anything .
if you think he does ... ... you gotta hang up the phone ... ... 'cause that means the police have told him ... ... and the phone's probably tapped .
tapped the phone?
what are you talkin 'about?
come on , thelma .
murder one and armed robbery .
murder one?
we can't even say it was self defense?
it wasn't .
we were walkin 'away .
we got away .
yeah , but they don't know that .
it was just you and me there .
i'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him .
that's almost the truth .
it won't work .
why not?
because there's no physical evidence .
we can't prove he did it .
we can't even probably prove by now that he touched you .
god .
this law is some tricky shit , isn't it?
how do you know about all this stuff?
besides , what we gonna say about the robbery?
there's no excuse for that .
there's no such thing as justifiable robbery .
all right , louise , will you?
where'd you get this?
stole it .
hi .
hi !
who's the nut?
that's mrs. dickinson's husband .
shit twice and fall back in it .
god .
where'd you get the $6, 600 in cash?
a friend .
we spoke with a gentleman today .
he says he delivered ... ... very close to that same amount to a ms. louise sawyer .
do you know her , too?
yes , sir .
i believe she was the woman drivin 'the car .
he said he took it to a motel in oklahoma city .
he also says that at that time he met a man .
he identified you through a series of mug shots .
he also told us that you and mrs. dickinson seemed " close .
is that true?
well , sir .
you might say ... ... we had a meetin 'of the minds , yeah .
are you aware that mrs. dickinson ... ... and ms. sawyer are wanted in connection with a murder?
murder?
what , thelma?
damn !
did they ever indicate that they might be on the run from the law?
now that you mention it ... ... they might have seemed a little bit jumpy .
you know what?
what?
you're starting to irritate me .
me , too .
well , that'll happen .
you two boys have a lot in common .
maybe i should just step out of the room for a sec .
i got a better idea .
do you mind if i speak to him alone , for a minute?
what?
what'd i do?
nothin ', that's what .
tell you somethin ', this is just a crock of shit ... ... mr. john fucking law .
son , i got a feeling about something and ... ... l just wanna ask your opinion .
do you think thelma dickinson would have committed armed robbery ... ... if you hadn't taken all their money?
get your foot off that table .
cat got your tongue?
no , naw .
well , how do you know i took it?
how do you know they didn't ...
don't you fucking lie to me !
there's two girls out there that had a chance .
they " had " a chance .
and now you've screwed it up for them .
no .
and now they're in some serious trouble .
i'm gonna hold you personally responsible ... ... for at least part of it if anything happens to them .
i got no feelin 'for you .
you're either gonna tell me every damn thing you know ... ... so there's a small chance ... ... that i can actually do them some good ... ... or i'm gonna be all over you like a fly on shit for the rest of your life .
your miseries will be my goddamn mission in life .
yes , sir .
okay?
yeah .
that's right .
we understand each other?
yeah .
mr. dickinson?
would you just hang on?
i want a word with you .
i like your wife .
hey , come back here !

oh , i just ... ... l just told him if he ever got to mexico , he should look us up .
but i ... l didn't ...
i asked him not to tell .
i thought he would not tell anybody , you know .
i didn't think he's gonna tell anybody .

hello , this is 9 8
you want to step back and get in your car again , please?
officer .
i am so sorry about this .
would you let go of that?
now , i really apologize , but would you put your hands on the steering wheel?
if you get on that radio ... ... you're gonna find out that we're wanted in two states ... ... and probably considered armed and dangerous , at least i am ... ... and then our whole plan's just gonna be all shot to hell .
louise , take his gun .
take his gun , louise .
it's right there .
right .
i'm real sorry .
excuse me .
you want to step out of the car , please?
i swear , three days ago neither one of us ... ... would've ever pulled a stunt like this , but ... ... if you was ever to meet my husband , you'd understand why .
you want to put your hands on your head , please?
louise .
what?
shoot the radio .
right .
the police radio , louise .
jesus christ !
i'm sorry .

okay .
you want to step to the back of the car , please?
louise , get the keys .
thelma , what is it?
what's wrong?
air , air holes .
open the trunk .
shit , thelma .
who'd have thought it?

please , i have a wife and kids .
please .

well , you're lucky .
you be sweet to 'em ... ... especially your wife .
my husband wasn't sweet to me , look how i turned out .
now , go on .
get in there .
wait a second .
excuse me .
wait a minute .
officer , could i have your belt , please?
extra ammo .
good idea .
could i trade glasses with you , maybe?
thanks .
okay .
is that it?
all right .
okay .
officer , i'm real sorry about this .
i apologize , also .
go .
you ready?
hit it .
i know it's crazy ... ... but i just feel like i got a knack for this shit .
i believe you do .
drive like hell .
the one thing i can't figure out is ... ... whether these girls are real smart or just real lucky .
it don't matter .
brains'll only get you so far ... ... and luck always runs out .
louise , we still going to mexico?
yeah .
then , aren't we going in the wrong direction?
i figure if you take a state policeman ... ... shoot up his car , take his gun and lock him in the trunk ... ... it's best just to get on out of the state if you can .
i heard that .
don't ding my car !
i think i fucked up .
i think i got us in a situation where we both could get killed .
i don't know why i just didn't go to the police right away .
you know why .
you already said .
what'd i say , again?
nobody'd believe us .
we'd still get in trouble , we'd still have our lives ruined .
you know what else?
what?
that guy was hurting me .
if you hadn't come out when you did , he would have hurt me a lot worse .
and probably nothin 'would've happened to him ... ... 'cause everybody did see me dancin 'with him all night .
they would've made out like i'd asked for it .
my life would've been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now .
at least now i'm havin 'some fun .
and i'm not sorry that son of a bitch is dead .
i'm just sorry it was you that did it , and not me .
hello .
let me talk to slocombe .
she wants to talk to you .
hello , louise .
hey .
how are things going out there?
weird .
we got some ... ... kind of a snowball effect happening here or somethin '.
you're still with us , though .
somewhere on the face of the earth?
we're not in the middle of nowhere , but we can see it from here .
i swear .
louise , i almost feel like i know you .
you don't .
you're getting deeper every moment you're gone .
would you believe me if i told you this thing was an accident?
i do believe you .
that's what i want everybody to believe .
trouble is , it doesn't look like an accident .
and you're not here to tell me about it .
i need your help here .
did harlan puckett
i don't wanna talk about that .
you wanna come on in?
don't think so .
then , i'm sorry .
we're gonna have to charge you with murder .
do you want to come out of this alive?
you know ... ... certain words and phrases just keep drifting through my mind .
things like incarceration , cavity search , death by electrocution ... ... life imprisonment , shit like that .
you know what i'm saying?
so do i want to come out alive?
i don't know , i ...
... l don't know .
i think ... ... we're gonna have to think about that .
i'll do anything .
i know what's making you run .
i know what happened to you in texas .
come on , louise .
don't blow it .
we got it !
give it to me .
god !
max .
you gotta take me there .
no , hal , cannot do .
you've done your job .
i'm the only one ... ... she's ever spoken to , max .
you're no good to me , now .
there's nothing you can do for me , now .
i don't want anybody losing their heads .
you know what happens .
the volume gets turned way up ... ... and the next thing you know these girls are gonna get shot !
what?
you're not gonna give up on me , are you?
what do you mean?
you're not gonna make a deal with that guy?
i mean ... ... l just want to know .
thelma , i'm not making any deals .
i mean , i'd understand if you was thinkin 'about it .
in a way , you got somethin 'to go back for , jimmy 'n 'all .
jimmy's not an option .
but ... ... l don't know , you know ... ... something's like crossed over in me .
i can't go back , i mean ...
... l just couldn't live .
i know .
i know what you mean .
anyway , we don't want to end up on the damned geraldo show .
yeah .
they're charging us with murder .
yeah , they say that we gotta figure out ... ... if we want to come in dead or alive .
gosh .
did he say anything positive at all?
you awake?
guess you could call it that .
my eyes are open .
me , too .
i feel awake .
good .
wide awake .
i don't remember ever feeling this awake .
you know what i mean?
everything looks different .
you feel like that , too , like ... ... you got something to look forward to?
we'll be drinking margaritas by the sea , mamacita .
hey , we can change our names .
we could live in a hacienda .
i'm gonna get a job .
i'm gonna work at club med .
now what kind of a deal is that cop gonna have to come up with to beat that?
have to be pretty good .
have to be pretty damn good .
but i do have some advice to pass along ... ... right here in the words of this song .
oh , my god , louise .
oh , look .
see it , that's him .
it's him .
