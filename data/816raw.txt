i did .
i did .
i i thought i was a cat .
well , kind of , kind of .
i identified with cats .
well , i kind of did .
i wonder why that was?
they're never sure when you try to stroke them , is that right?
so maybe i was a sad cat .
was i a sad cat?
because i wonder
yeah , yeah , yeah , i wonder about cats .
truly , i did .
i did .
i did .
'cause i was a fuddy duddy .
fuddy duddy .
i kissed them all .
kissed them .
i will always kiss cats .
if a cat would let me kiss it , i'd kiss it .
you know , if i see a cat on the fence ,
i'll kiss it .
always .
always .
i would , didn't i?
life's a perpetual risk , isn't it?
that's right .
i think it is .
because , the point is , i was different in those days .
i was .
i was .
and i've i've got to be different again .
so , can the leopard change its spots?
i mean , who knows?
it's a blood sport .
i think it's a blood sport .
it's true .
it seems to be true .
or is it a blank?
bit of a scrabble .
you've got to put all the pieces together , see if you can make a word .
that's funny .
that's funny .
that's funny .
it's a mystery .
it's a mystery .
bye !

we're closed !
what's the problem , mate?
sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry , mate .
i'm the problem .
i think i'm the problem .

but it's not an ideal world .
is it an ideal world?
we just have to make the most of it .
this is the way we find it , isn't it?
yeah , yeah .
it's more ideal than it was , because , i mean , you know , i mean , we're privileged .
we're privileged , aren't we?
because not long ago , people would be burnt to a steak , wouldn't they , moby?
moby , yeah !

sylvia .
to to survive .

yeah .
whatever you do , i think it's a struggle , a struggle , a struggle to keep your head above water ... and not get it chopped off .

i'm callous , daddy said .
callous .
and a bit of a meanie .
sorry , sylvia , i'm not damaging you .
i mustn't damage sylvia .
the point is , the point is , perhaps i haven't got a soul .

david , you're a very lucky boy .
my father never let me have music .
i know .
a very lucky boy .

margaret !
i told you , tell your friends not to come .
hello .
daddy , there's somebody to see you !
hello .
i hope i'm not interrupting .
uh , ben rosen .
i was one of the judges .
yes?
you left before all the prizes were announced .
you were very good this afternoon , david .
thank you .
he can play better .
well , maybe he was a little too good .
some people don't like that .
we , uh , we gave him a special prize for his courage .
difficult piece you chose , david .
daddy chose it .
well , even great pianists think twice ... before tackling the polonaise .
a prize for losing .
i wouldn't call him a loser .
they all ... they all play .
well , i'm quite sure ...
david could win lots of competitions ... with the right tuition .
my card .
i teach him .
yeah .
you've obviously done very well .
yeah .
no one taught me .
no music teachers , mr. rosen .
no , of course .
it's just , uh ... it's just a few bad habits ... can sometimes mean the difference between winning ... or losing .
well , perhaps you'd , uh , you'd like to think about it , hmm?
it's rachmaninoff .
it's beautiful .
yeah .
you taught yourself?
from the record .
ah , yeah .
it's ... it's very difficult .
it's very difficult .
it's ... it's the hardest piece in the world , you know?
will you teach me?
you know ... one day you will play it .
you will make me very proud ... very proud , won't you , david?
yes .
and , uh ... next time ...
what are we going to do?
we're going to win?
we're going to win , yes .
so ... good night .
good night , daddy .
come .
come , come , come .
don't touch .
don't touch .
yes?
mr. rosen , i have decided i would like ... you teach david ... this .
rachmaninoff?
don't be ridiculous .
but he can play it already .
he's just a boy .
how can he express that sort of passion?
you are a passionate man , mr. rosen .
you will teach him , no?
no .
i will teach him what i think is best .
rachmaninoff is best .
but ...
you're his teacher .
i'll let you decide .
thank you .
we'll start with mozart .
mr. rosen .
i can't afford to pay .
come on , david .
sylvia's getting wet .

a few years , i think .
eons , i suppose .
how does that sound?
and schubert .
schubert .
nothing wrong with schubert , of course except syphilis .
was it syphilis?
i think it was .
and then he got typhoid on top of that , so that was the end of him .
we lost him .
that was a bit careless of us , wasn't it?
we lost him ...
so , you're back?
oh , jim , jim , jim , i've been a naughty boy .
was i a naughty boy?
i was about to send out a search party .
oh , a party , a party .

he came into my restaurant and seemed a bit lost .
oh , he's very good at that .

margaret .
no .
i have no money to send david to america .
well , uh ...
we'll raise it .

bar mitzvah .
david hasn't yet had his bar mitzvah .
religion is nonsense .

and then one day , i i'll play with an orchestra .
wow !
can i come when you do?
you can ride in my cadillac .
where are you going to live in america?
with a nice jewish family , they said .
this is not a nice family?
yes , daddy .
it's ... very nice .
you're very lucky to have a family , david .
i've got to go .
it's one of the finest music schools in the world .
it is for his father to decide .
he would be well looked after , i assure you .
rachel , please .
david could be one of the truly great pianists .
he is just a boy , mr. rosen .
he still wets his bed .
you see how fit i am?
how strong?
show me where the lion scratched you ... when you worked in the circus , daddy .
up , up , up , up , up .

yeah , yeah , yeah .
as hard as you can .
me !
i want to hit you , daddy !
you , too .
as hard as you can .

a man of steel !
no one can hurt me .
because in this world , only the fit survive .

mr. rosen .
ladies and gentlemen , can i have your attention please?
i would like to thank our wonderful lord mayor ... for establishing this fund to send david to america .
and now to play for us , our very own david helfgott .
these people are a disgrace .
they think they are so important .
what do they know with their furs and their diamonds?
it makes me sick ... to the stomach .
and rosen .
what kind of man is he?
he is not married .
he has no children .
don't talk to me about rosen .
he only wants for david ... the same as you have always wanted .
don't ever compare me to him .
what has he suffered?
not a day in his life .
what does he know?
does he know about families?
about ... how your sisters died?
and my mother and father?

you know , a bath is always the best , david .
always the ...
disgusting animal .
to shit in the bath .
to do this to me .
you disgusting animal !
i know you can hear me .
don't do this to david .
you mustn't stop him going .
whatever you do , don't you dare inflict bloody rachmaninoff on him .
he's not ready !
david ... my boy .
it's a terrible thing ... to hate your father .
you know , life is cruel , but ... but music ... music , it will always ... always be your friend .
everything else ... will let you down .
ln the end , everything , believe me , everything .
don't hate me .
life is cruel .
but you have ... you have to ... you have to survive .
you have to survive .
say it .
you have to survive , daddy .
you have to survive .
no one ... will love you like me .
you can't trust anyone .
but i will always ... be there .
i will always be with you .
forever and ever .
forever and ever , daddy .
each time you play for me , it expresses so completely the ... inexpressible .
is that good?
it's divine .
lnexpressibly divine .
quite .
tell me a story , katharine .
what's the story today?
a new story .
drops of water?
ah ... raindrops .
yes , raindrops .
perfect .
i shall treasure this till the day i die .
to you , all these wild weeds ...
and wind flowers of my life ...
i bring , my lord ,
and lay them at your feet .
they're not frankincense or myrrh ,
but you are krishna , christ , and dionysus ...
in your beauty , tenderness , and strength .
that was our final contestant david helfgott ... with a very stirring rachmaninoff .
well , what a close contest we have , with the national championship ... almost certain to go to one of the two pianists .
bravo , david .
i dare say it's going to be difficult for the judges ... to separate them , either one a worthy winner .
the judges are now conferring .
it's a tough game , isn't it , roger?
it's a blood sport .
ladies and gentlemen ...
i'm pleased to announce the winner ... of this year's instrumental and vocal competition .
our new national champion is ...
roger woodward .
what was he like , katharine?
your father .
he was forever busy in his study .
go away , kattie , i'm writing , " he'd always say .
one day oh , i was very young
i got so annoyed ... that i upset the ink pots all over his desk ... and scrawled on his work .
pages of it .
when he saw it , he just stood there seething with anger .
i could feel it .
what are you doing? " he shouted .
well , there was this terrible silence ... and i just stared at him and said ,
go away , daddy .
i'm writing .
he ran at me and he picked me up ... and he cuddled me breathless .
my first literary effort , he always called it .
david , what is it?
royal college of music .
a scholarship .
oh , david , that's marvelous .
daddy won't cuddle me , katharine .
oh , no .
he can't stop you , david .
he's such an angry lion , katharine .
oh , nonsense .
he's a pussycat .
i'll miss you .
these were for my son , but you better have them .
it gets very , very cold in london .
where have you been?
i missed the train .
that prichard woman .
what is this?
the gloves .
look at me .
look at me !
and you think you can just do as you please?
i i want to go , and you can't stop me .
but ...
i'm your father ... who has done everything for you .
everything !
you cruel , callous boy !
mum !
margaret !
stupid !
stupid
leave him .
leave him !
leave him alone .
go , go !
go !
you want to go , go !
i'll call the police !
go !
go !
stop it !
yeah , all right .
leave him .
he's all right .
are you all right , david?
are you all right?
yeah?
come on , david .
he's all right .
i'm old enough to make up my own mind .
he thinks he's going to london .
i've been accepted into the royal college of music .
what do you think is going to happen to you in london?
david ... if you go ... you will never come back into this house again .
you will never be anybody's son .
the girls will lose a brother .
is that what you want?
you want ... you want to destroy your family?
i'm i'm sorry .
david , if you love me , you will stop this nonsense .
you will not step out that door .
david .
if you go , you will be punished ... for the rest of your life .
my david .
don't go .
david !
don't make me do it !
he has the most fantastic hands .
not connected to anything above his shoulders .
oh , he's a bit fragile , certainly .
chopinzee .
i've seen enough to suggest ... that he can make the finals in the concerto trials .
what have you seen , cecil?
moments of genius .
genius?
really .
come on , david .
boldness of attack .
diablerie .
the devil , david .
mustn't break the piano .
liszt broke plenty of strings .
right .
right .
come on .
fill in for this useless arm of mine .
the notes first .
the interpretation comes on top of them .
on top , yes .
yes .
you agree , do you?
oh , yes .
i always agree , professor .
is that wise?
i i don't know .
is it?
don't forget .
it's on the page .
yes .
well , the ... the notes are on the page , but , uh , not the feeling , the emotion .
that's what i feel .
you mustn't sacrifice everything to emotion .
it's all a question of balance .
ah , yes . ls that the question , professor?
precisely .
ah .
i thought so .
that's what i thought .
mr. helfgott !
your allowance check !
thank you , mr. right .
sorry .
sorry .
sorry .
i'll just stand still if you like .
be careful , david .
oh , by all means , sarah .
you look lovely today , sarah .
thank you , david .
you , too , muriel .
ease up , helfgott .
sarah !
david !
you missed the bank .
pity .
you'll have to wait until tomorrow .
can't bank on the bank .
we know someone who can cash it .
do we , robert?
what are friends for?
got to concentrate .
got to concentrate , katharine .
got to practice , practice , practice , because there's 3 important things professor parkes says , and that's work , work , work .
and and , uh , so that's what i have to do ... if i'm , uh , going to make the finals to the concerto medal , because the winner , which gets to play at the royal albert hall , which is right outside the window .
i i bought a piano , katharine .
a beautiful piano .
it's a suffering piano , like yours .
i i wrote to daddy , so , uh , that's a positive .
it's a positive , isn't it?
because , well , it seems to be , because he didn't write back , but , um , uh ...
now , how on earth ... did we manage to get into the finals , david?
you're a conductor's nightmare .
it's true , it's true .
and what are we going to do?
we're going to win , actually , robert .
we're going to win .
rachmaninoff?
are you sure?
uh , kind of .
i'm never really sure about anything , mr. parkes .
the rach 3 .
it's monumental !
it's a mountain .
it's the hardest piece you could everest play .
well , no one's ever been mad enough to attempt the rach 3 .
am i ... mad enough , professor?
am i?
think of it as two separate melodies jousting for supremacy .
the hands , giants ten fingers each .
performing's a risk , you know no safety net .
make no mistake , david .
it's dangerous .
people get hurt .
you have to learn to be able to play it blindfolded .
the page , for god's sake !
the notes !
i'm sorry .
i was , uh , forgetting them , professor .
would it be asking too much to learn them first?
and and then forget them?
precisely .
just give me the fingering .
david .
come on , my boy .
we're going to rest muscles and fingers today ... and try to exercise the imagination .
first movement cadenza .
let's pick it up from , uh ...
your hands must form the unbreakable habit ... of playing the notes , so that you can forget all about them ... and let it come from here .
the heart ... that's where it comes from .
don't you just love those big , fat chords?
you have to tame the piano , david , or it'll get away from you .
it's a monster .
tame it , or it'll swallow you whole .
coming along nicely , david .
morning , mrs. perkins .
i call this my little mausoleum , david .
ah , liszt warts and all .
they made this after he was dead .
poor franz .
dead as a post , eh?
you can still get these on the left bank , you know .
quite cheap .
i've got rachmaninoff in here somewhere .
magnificent fingers .
so virile .
you know , i ... played the rach 3 for him once .
really?
yes .
he said he could hear himself in my playing .
he said it seemed ... as if i had touched his soul .
that wasn't so bad , was it?
not too bad at all , professor .
now it's your turn , david .
remember ... once you've done it , nobody can ever take it away from you .
and you must play ... as if there was no tomorrow .
come on , david , don't let me down .
how many moments of genius today , cecil?
hello?
who is this?
hello?
daddy?
daddy , i'm home .
daddy?
hello?
daddy?
someone here to see you , david .
it's me , david .

oh , sister suzie , sister suzie .
thank you , sister .
sister nurse .
sister suzie .
david , i won't be able to come and visit so often .
not not so often , sweet sweet , soft suzie .
not so often .
i'm going to live in melbourne .
oh , that's a trick .
don't tell daddy .
the milk the milk mustn't cry over spilt milk .
oh , well , what can you do , margaret?
what can you do?
margaret's in lsrael , remember?
i remember margaret .
she called me dopey .
or was it a pig?
it was the poodle .
it was the poodle .
it was the poodle .
it was all very complicated , wasn't it?
