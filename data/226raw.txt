i was justtrying ... to keep my edge , major .
and when you did the outside loop lastweek ... what did you thinkthatwas?
honing your skills?
that's nottraining , mccawley .
that's astunt .
andlpersonally consideritto be reckless ... and irresponsible .
major ...
how could that be , when you'refamous ... for being thefirst man in the world everto do it?
don't get cute with me , son .
no , sir , i don't mean to be disrespectful .
i justthinkthat well , l
it is reckless and irresponsible ... if you're just doing it to be a show off .
but i was doing itto try to inspire the men , sir ... in the way that you've inspired me .
i believe the french even have a wordforthat ... when the men gettogether to honortheir leaders .
they call it an homage , sir .

boxing .
did you win?
yes , ma'am .
what do you getforwinning?
respect .

i left my momma in texas ... and joined the navy to see the world ... become a man .
they made me a cook .
not even that .
i clean up after other sailors eat .
two years, they never even let mefire a weapon .
well , let's hope you never have to .
yes , ma'am .
you take care , petty officer miller .
you, too , ma'am .
youknow , he taughtme to fly .
ialways knew thatno matter whattrouble lgotinto ...
i'd never be in it alone .
he'd be there with me .
he was always pushing me to be better andfaster .
he told me you were a greatflier .
itwas the same night he told me ... he'd volunteered to go to england .
volunteered?
he ... he told me he'd been assigned .
he was always trying to protect me .
butyou know what?
i look at myself in the mirror in this uniform ... and i still don't know who i am .
i look like a hero ... but i don'tfeel like it .
rafe ... he always looked the part , didn't he?
he couldn'twaitto be one .

you know , i could get kicked out of the militaryforthis .
really?
yeah .
stay down .
the hawaiians called this harbor waimomi .
it means " water of pearls .
it's so beautiful .
my dadtookme up a couple oftimes .
just don't do what he did .
what do you call it when youflip over?
danny : a barrelroll?
yeah .
i won't .
aah !
oh !
ha ha ha ha !
oh , god .
what do you think?
i like that .
man : hey !
thatplane was supposed to be backhere anhourago !
quick , hide in the parachute hangar .
my heart is pounding .
danny , last night ...
no, that's terrible .
danny, we need to talk aboutthis .
sir .
evelyn !
danny .
hey .
hi .
hi .
i didn't sleep a wink last night .
i had to see you .
last nightwas crazy , i know , but ...
i'm not sorry .
are you?
i don't know .
danny , i had a wonderful time last night .
i
it's just all toofast .
listen , evelyn , i was just down atthe beach this morning ... and i watched the sun rise ... and i knew that everything was gonna be different .
thatthis was the start of something new .
in this place , in this moment .
and i don't care what anybody else says, you know?
how can i notfeel this way?
i kinda like you .
oh, you do?
you have yourtie on crooked .
everything's gonna be all right , ok?
everything's gonna be all right .
do you have any airtours going through the valley of oahu?
you do?
maleradlohost : aloha .
this is kgmb inhonolulu ... on anotherbeautiful fall dayhere inparadise .
we have enough information .
we are returninghome .
evelyn : do you everwonder ... ifthis war's gonna catch up with us?
nota whole lot .
every momentwe're nottogether , you're upthere trainingfor it .
yeah, well , i'm training for moments like these ...
'cause i have no idea ... how i'm gonna getthis car out of the sand .
evelyn , can you please come out of the bathroom?
you've been therefor an hour .
evelyn !
what are you trying to do , look like me?
barbara : are you ok?
yeah .
what's the matter?
no, you
d'oy .
they call itthe vacant sea .
none of the major sea lanes go through it ... and you can bury the entire land mass of asia there ... andnobody wouldknow .
from there , they could attack anywhere .
our last signals intercept ... indicate thatthe japanese taskforce is heading south ... towards the philippines orsoutheastasia .
but captain thurman of naval lntelligence here ... has his own theory aboutthe missing ships .
sir , i believe they'll try to hit us ... where it'll hurt us the most pearl harbor .
it's over4, 000 nautical miles from japan to pearl .
that's alongdistance to steam anavy , captain .
yourtheory is based on what?
well , it's what i would do .
that's notexactly hardevidence , captain thurman .
well, admiral , if i had hard evidence ... we'd already be atwar .
sir, we can read their diplomatic codes ... fasterthan they can type them .
but captain thurman's cryptology team ... is still trying to crackthe naval codes .
the intercepts have missing words and garbled lines ... so to explain the decrypts , we have to try to interpret ... whatwe think they're trying to do .
interpret?
you mean guess .
they use their informed intuition , sir .
we guess .
it's like playing chess in the dark .
any rumor, troop movement , ship movement ... spine tingle , goose bump , we pay attention to it .
when i was in the asiatic fleet ... the locals used to try to get outside of a problem ... to try to see the inside .
well, lsee astrike onpearl .
it's the worstthing that could happen .
a blow to pearl would devastate ... the pacific fleet's ability to make war .
so , sir, you would have us mobilize the entirefleet ... atthe cost of millions of dollars ... based on this spine tingling feeling of yours?
no , sir .
my job is to gather and interpret material .
makingdifficult decisions ... based on incomplete information ... from my limited decoding ability ... is yourjob , sir .
then breakthe damn naval code , captain ... so i can make a better decision .
aye , sir .
we are trying .
i wonder if we shouldn't put the pacific fleet onfull alert .
ln case the optimism ... ofthe " honoluluadvertiser " proves unfounded, gentlemen ... what are general short and the army ... going to do about protecting my ships?
within a ten mile radius of your harbor ... we have fighterplanes here at wheeler ... bombers athickam , and a trainingstrip athaleiwa .
we've recently established a radar station here ... thatcan detectplanes 125miles out .
which is a month old, admiral , and untested .
i've seen these new radar screens , major .
there's no way of telling whetherthey're ours, theirs ... or aflock of damn birds .
llstener : l'm intercepting a callfrom tokyo ... to somewhere close bypearl .
there's a callfrom tokyo .
they say they don't know you .
hello?
hai .
it's alocaldentist .
he cansee pearlharbor from his office .
are there many sailors around?
uh , the dentist says thatthe flatships ... are not in port .
they're talkingabout the weather .
he doesn'tseem to know who he's talkingto .
hello?
hello?
moshi moshi .
hello?
thatwas a strange call .
admiral , may i speakto you in private?
why wouldaspy use aphone?
they know we tap all international lines .
our listenersfeel it's probably not code talk .
it sounds like someone in japan is sneaking around ... asking a local citizen the location of our carriers .
well, that makes mefeel all warm inside .
getthe fbi on it immediately .
have wefound the goddamn japanese fleetyet?
no, admiral .
the bases are looking all overthe pacific .
so the entirefleet could be rounding diamond head ... and we wouldn't know a thing about it .
get on it .
rafe : l'm alive .
this is the first lcouldgetwordout .
jepense gu'llestmort !
ilestencore en vie .

anthony : danny .
you know, they're all about tactics is what it is .
see, the nazis , right , they'refasterthan you are ... so they'll disappear and they get up in the soup ... and they'll throw like a roll or a hammerhead ... and they'll come around on your high side ... shootyoufrom behind iike some americans will .

and we were justtryin 'to get on with our lives .

yeah , rafe, well , i stayed .
i stayed , and you made sure of that ... and some things changed .
and i hope you can get used to that .
