ally , can we get a recap?
you remember the kowolskis .
they've owned this shop for 30 years , and they are attempting to set a record ... by making buffalo's largest cookie , and you have to wear this .
a hair net?
health department .
you're kidding me .
if you're around the cookie , you have to have it on .
it's the law .
i just did the hair .
the hair is perfect .
all right .
give it to me .
god , why do you hate me?
we're rolling .
and speed .
for three decades , the kowolski family bakery ... has been a mainstay in downtown buffalo ... known for their sinfully sweet , cream filled polski pierogis ... and the occasional sugar induced coma that follows .
but today , in honor of their 30th anniversary , they've invited us to ride along as they go for the record ... on buffalo's biggest cookie .
vol .
vol .
you need a tissue or something?
can we get vol a tissue or a spoon?
it's a good thing we're wearing these today , 'cause i wouldn't want any stray hairs ... to fall into the booger .
are we gonna do this again?
no .
we can cut to b roll .
moving on !
so tell me , mama .
why make buffalo's biggest cookie?
well , man from health department ... say he find rat pellet in our pastry , but i say , " no .
is big chocolate sprinkle .
but he shut store down .
so we clean up , make big cookie ... for to bring customers back .
well , i admire your candor .
let's try that again , shall we?
so tell me , mama .
why make buffalo's biggest cookie?
so the children of the neighborhood will be happy?
that's right .
it must be wonderful seeing the smiles on their little faces .
i work in back .
i see no smiles .
the previous buffalo record was eight feet , seven inches , baked by gladys pelsnick .
if this cookie beats gladys's , it will prove once and for all ... that the kowolskis have much more free time .
and the cookie is 10 feet , four inches .
we have a new record !
cue the cheesy inspirational music !
but what are we really looking at here?
is it just a big cookie , or does this cookie represent the pride of buffalo , its dedicated and hardworking citizens the key ingredient ... with a few nuts thrown in ... and , finally , the love of our families , which provides the warm , chewy center , making our beloved buffalo the sweetest place to live .
and that's the way the cookie crumbles .
i'm bruce nolan , eyewitness news .
and cut it .
what do you think?
i think it's really good .
it sucks .
it's a story about a cookie .
the pillsbury doughboy will be riveted .
ohh .
honey , it was funny .
it made me laugh .
there's nothing wrong with makin 'people laugh .
i'll never be an anchorman , not with this .
the job's right there , but i can't reach it , because every time they make me do this stuff ,
i have to act like a total goof in order to make it work .
i have no credibility .
not good .
not good .
you know what?
now you're just sounding silly .
know what?
forget it .
it's not important , right?
it's not important .
let's watch it one more time .
oh , no .
just once more .
please?
no .
no .
bruce , you promised you would help with this album .
now , you get your goofy butt over here .
uh uh .
okay .
okay .
okay .
now , you just go through this stack , and you pick your favorites .
oh , come on .
this is fun .
right?
isn't this fun?
this is nice .
evan's gonna get that anchor job ; i just know it .
ah , bruce !
he's the favorite .
all right .
you know what?
just forget it .
let's just forget it .
this is just our life .
we can always just have some kid do it for us .
whoa !
hold the phone !
i like this one .
our weekend at the lake .
how did you get that?
that's supposed to be in our private stash .
you look perky , hon .
it must've been cold .
all right .
just give it to me .
i think i'll put this on my computer and use it as wallpaper .
no , no , no .
okay .
give it to me .
come on !
no , no , no .
all right .
fine .
do with it what you will .
i don't care .
i will do with it what i will .
jesus .
you know , i might even send this in to playboy .
i hear their layouts can be quite tasteful .
give that to me right now !
jesus .
right now !
ow !
rough stuff !
i'm gonna hurt you ...
sweetie?
time to get up .
uh uh .
good dream .
no .
uh uh .
no .
well , the buffalo sabres lost again last night ... at the hands of the toronto maple leafs .
it was a shootout on the ice for our hometown ...
of course .
they're my team .
and that's the way the cookie crumbles .
you know , i think there might be something ... to this cookie line .
all the greatest anchors have had their own signature sign off ,
like wal ter cron kite .
and that's the way it was .
that's the way the cookie crumbles .
and that's the way , uh huh , uh huh , i like it , uh huh , uh huh .
oh , no .
grace , the dog !
i'm in the shower !
no , sam !
bad dog !
inside , bad .
outside , good .
inside , bad .
outside , good .
oh , you're done now .
great .
b e a utiful .
come on .
let's go back inside and have a shit .
what is the deal io? we are having a blood drive .
creepy .
needles .
yuck .
well , they need my blood .
i have a very rare blood type .
i'm a. b. positive .
really?
mm hmm .
i'm i. b. positive .
i be positive they ain't touchin 'me with no needle .
it's just so ...
helpful and lifesaving?
no .
it's your blood .
it's blood .
blood's supposed to stay inside the body .
that's where it's meant to be .
besides , they stockpile this stuff in a warehouse somewhere .
it's all frozen on ice , and they tell everybody there's a shortage .
that's just not true .
where did you hear that?
from a very reliable friend of a friend of a girl ... whose sister's going out with someone very high up in the government .
but for your own protection , i cannot discuss it at this time .
now , get out before they see us .
oh , no .
oh .
here .
hold on a second .
you need these more than i do .
what is these?
prayer beads .
the kids made 'em for me .
they will keep you safe .
i hope they're powerful .
i'm gonna need a friggin 'miracle to get to work on time .
this isn't happening .
not now .
not during sweeps week .
not during sweeps week !
oh , god .
yeah .
yeah .
meeting's started without me .
this is my luck .
this is my luck !
shit .
oh , come on .
come on .

evan , when i know something , you'll know something .

it's a nice story , bruce , but we're gonna go with evan's piece ... sex scandal in the mayor's office ... for sweeps .
oh , yeah .

and that's the way the cookie crumbles .
i'm just messing with you , bruce .

do you like jazz , evan?
yeah .
let me play something for ya .
i can hold that note all day , buddy .

bruce , we're gonna keep your story in reserve .

i've hit some kind of a ceiling here .
there's an anti bruce barrier i can't get past .
and evan is lovin 'it , by the way .
lovin 'it .
he gets the stories .
he gets on sweeps .
maybe i should be more like evan .
you don't wanna be like evan .
evan's an asshole .
i can be an asshole .
no , bruce .
you can't .
you gonna pick that up?
yeah .
i'm sorry .

that's great !
yeah !
it's happening , hon .
i got sweeps , and i'm live .
you know what that means?
they're seein 'if i can think on my feet , you know , like i might have to do in a live news anchor situation .
oh , my gosh .
yeah .
it's what we've always talked about , grace .
jack practically came out and told me .
practically?
well , he didn't spell it out , but legally , he can't .
but this is exactly what happened to susan ortega just before they bumped her up .
it's good .
it's good .
it's good .
okay .
well , honey , i just don't ...
i don't want you to get too ahead of yourself .
bruce?
oh , i gotta go .
they're callin 'me in .
oh .
okay , honey .
good luck .
i love you .
love , love , love , love , love .
let's do it .
they want you close to the falls .
really?
i'm gonna get soaked .
that's the point .
they want you to put this on .
part of the condition of us getting the exclusive .
you know what?
nothin 'can bother me today .
nothin '.
okay .
now , remember .
it's their 156th year anniversary .
mm hmm .
149 capacity .

they cater to tourists , honeymooners ...
and people insanely thirsty .
i get it .
okay .
and you are gonna be interviewing irene dansfield .

irene's mother rode on the maiden voyage .
wow .
rub that in my face , why don't ya?
ninety seconds !
ninety seconds?
holy hell .
uh , yeah .
okay .
ninety seconds?
whoo .
because of the fast response , the toxic chemicals were cleaned up without incident .
susan?
bruce nolan is standing by at niagara falls , but before we go live to bruce , we have an announcement to make .
as everyone knows , after 33 years , our beloved pete fineman is retiring .
pete's shoes are virtually impossible to fill ,
but the show must go on , and we could think of no one better ... than our very own evan baxter .
ohh ...
oh , boy .
congratulations , evan .
thanks , susan .
i'm thrilled and honored .
and as you said , no one can replace the great pete fineman , but i will do my best .
i have to say , i am so proud to be a part of our local community of buffalo , and i think , in a lot of ways , a great city is like a great recipe , really .
you take hardworking citizens , add some caregivers , maybe a few nuts ,
all sprinkled with the love and support of good families .
ultimately , that makes one sweet place to live .
that was amazing .
i meant it .
i wish i'd written something .
and now let's go live ... to that wacky bruce nolan out at niagara falls .
hey !
wacky bruce !
bruce?
talk , bruce .
hello?
talk , honey .
talk .
what's going on?
we got a walt disney .
he's frozen solid .
we may not have audio .
check .
we may be having a bit of technical difficulty .
feed's good , jack .
move .
come on .
come on .
come on .
talk , bruce , damn it !
all right .
get ready to pull the plug .
come on , baby .
say something .
say something .
bruce , talk .
hi , susan .
oh , thank you , god .
bruce nolan here aboard the maid of the mist in fabulous niagara falls .
first off , let me just add another congratulations to evan backstabber ...
pardon me .
bastard .
baxter , rather .
it is good to see what someone with talent can do ... when great opportunities are given to them instead of me .
anyway , i'm here with katharine hepburn's mom .
tell me .
why did you throw the blue heart of the ocean jewel over the railing of the titanic?
did you feel bad at all letting leo dicaprio drown while you were safe , floating on the door?
could you have taken turns , or were you just too afraid to freeze your big , fat ass off?
hmm .
i guess that's how life is , isn't it?
some people are drenched , freezing to death on a stupid boat ... with a stupid hat , while others are in a comfy news studio , suckin 'up all the glory .
oh , well .
no big deal .
oh , boy .
oh , look .
it's the owner of the maid of the mist .
let's have a talk with him , shall we?
come on in here , bill .
that's all right .
no , no , no , no .
no , no .
come on .
let's have a talk .
come on .
what are you doing?
bill , you've been running the maid of the mist for 23 years now .
tell me .
why do you think i didn't get the anchor job?
hey , man .
i don't want problems .
is it my hair , bill?
are my teeth not white enough?
or like the great falls , is the bedrock of my life ... eroding beneath me?
eroding !
eroding !
eroding !
cut the feed .
go to black .
go to black .
i'm on it .
i'm bruce nolan for eyewitness news .
back to you , fuckers !
oh , boy .
oh , my god .
that is perfect .
that is the motivation that i needed !
right there !
thank you .
thank you , w. k. b. w !
wimpy kitty baby whiners !
that's what that stands for !
i'll see you on channel 5 , where they do the real news .
do i look blind to you?
do i look blind to you?
hey .
let's go , man .
come on .
let's go .
what are you doing over there?
come on .
leave the poor guy alone .
you okay , man?
yeah , you'd better keep walkin '.
what?
what'd you say , ese?
run , man !
run !
oh , god !
okay , okay , okay !
i didn't mean it !
i was just kiddin '!
hey , you forgot your things .
say somethin 'to that .
say somethin '.
b e a ... utiful .
that's what i get ...
that's what i get for trying to help someone .
oh , don't look at me , walter .
oh , no !
well , that's my payment , i guess .
that ...
that is my reward .
just?
just get a clue !
thank god you're all right .
yeah .
let's thank god .
for his blessings are raining down upon me .
wait !
that's not rain !
bruce , please don't do that , honey .
you know that everything happens for a reason .
that i don't need .
that is a cliche .
that is not helpful to me .
a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush .
i have no bird .
i have no bush .
god has taken my bird and my bush .
oh , i see .
so god is picking on you , is that what you're saying?
no .
he's ignoring me completely .
he's far too busy giving evan everything he wants .
oh , that's great , sam , but you missed your target .
i'm over here !
don't get mad at the dog .
it's not the dog's fault .
no .
it's god's fault .
i gave him the wrong coordinates .
all right .
you know what?
enough .
all right?
will you stop being such a martyr?
i am not being a martyr .
i'm a victim .
god is a mean kid sitting on an anthill with a magnifying glass , and i'm the ant .
he could fix my life in five minutes if he wanted to , but he'd rather burn off my feelers and watch me squirm !
sweetheart , i know you're mad .
it's understandable .
what evan did is slimy and wrong , but this day could've been so much worse .
i'm just glad you're okay .
okay?
news flash !
i'm not okay .
i'm not okay with a mediocre job !
i'm not okay with a mediocre apartment .
i'm not okay with a mediocre life !
so is that what you think that we have?
a mediocre life?
don't make this about you .
about me?
how could i make this about me?
it's about you !
it's always about you !
perfect .
perfect .
i'll have the worst day of my life with a side order of guilt , please !
oh .
okay , god .
you want me to talk to you?
then talk back .
tell me what's going on .
what should i do?
give me a signal .
oh , i need your guidance , lord .
please send me a sign .
ah , what's this joker doin 'now?
okay .
all right .
i'll try it your way .
all right .
lord , i need a miracle .
i'm desperate .
i need your help , lord .
please reach into my life .
hey !
what the he ...
i got ya !
ha ha !
hey !
fine !
the gloves are off , pal !
come on !
let me see a little wrath .
smite me , o mighty smiter !
you're the one who should be fired !
the only one around here not doing his job is you !
answer me !
sorry .
don't know ya .
wouldn't call you if i did .
ohh .
oh , god .
ohh .
hello
oh , no !
sam , this has gotta stop .
all right .
now , get it straight here .
that's the house .
this is the bathroom .
house .
bathroom .
bathroom .
house .
house .
bathroom .
bathroom .
house .
what's the point?
denied that promotion at work?
is life unfair?
is there someone less talented than you reaping all the benefits?
is your name bruce?
then do we have the job for you .
we're located at 7725623rd street .
so come on down , or we'll just keep beeping you .
omni presents .
oh , yeah .
the glass is half full .
oh , geez !
come on !
look !
what is that?
what is that?
ah , geez !
thank you .
thank you again .
what the ...
you're looking for room 7 .
yeah .
i figured .
you want me to even those up for you?
how do i get to room 7?
that'll be on the seventh floor .
stairs are right over there .
i'd rather take the elevator .
out of order .
i love the stairs though .
they were my second choice .
do you mind giving me a hand with this floor?
what?
that's good .
are you serious?
oh , uh , i'm kind of busy .
um , rain check .
i'll hold you to it .
i'm free on the seventh at 7 : 00 .
seventh at 7 : 00 it is .
this looks promising .
hello?
another " hugantic ,
ginormic " waste of my life .
hello?
yo !
i'm lookin 'for whoever runs this joint .
be right with you .
i'm trying to fix a light .
tell me if it's working .
yeah .
seems to be .
kind ofbright , though .
yeah .
it is for most people .
spend their lives in the dark trying to hide from me .
oh , the elevator's broken , huh?
yeah , but i'll get around to it .
you install the clapper?
no , but catchy jingle , isn't it?
clap on , clap off
clap on , clap off the clapper
just can't get it out of my head .
good luck with that .
i'm gonna go now .
okay .
but the boss'll be right out .
you must be bruce .
i've been expecting you .
this is hilarious .
so you're the boss and the electrician and the janitor?
must be a killer christmas party .
don't get drunk , though .
one of you might need a ride home .
you always were funny , bruce , just like your father .
he didn't mind rolling up his sleeves , either , son .
people underestimate the benefit of good old manual labor .
there's freedom in it .
some of the happiest people in the world ... go home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day .
all right .
what is this?
how do you know my father , and how did you get my pager number?
oh , i know quite a lot about you , bruce ... just about everything there is to know .
everything you've ever said or done or thought about doing ... right there in that file cabinet .
wow .
a whole drawer just for me .
yeah .
mind if i take a look?
it's your life .
this oughta be good .
now , this last entry was a little disturbing .
the gloves are off , god .
god has taken my bird and my bush .
god is a mean kid with a magnifying glass .
smite me , o mighty smiter !
now , i'm not much for blaspheming , but that last one made me laugh .
are you spying on me?
who are you?
i'm the one .
huh?
creator of the heavens and the earth , alpha and omega .
oh , i see where this is going .
bruce , i'm god .
bingo !
yahtzee !
is that your final answer?
our survey says , " god !
bing , bing , bing , bing , bing !
well , it was nice to meet you , god .
thank you for the grand canyon , and good luck with the apocalypse .
oh , and by the way , you suck !
you know what would've been a little more impressive , though?
if you hadn't used the cheesy file cabinet illusion .
anybody with a brain stem can tell that that drawer ... is being fed through the wall from the other side .
all you have to do is find the crease , right around here .
there is a seam here ... or a hollow spot .
where?
through the drywall and concrete?
okay .
that is a good one .
that is a good one .
okay .
how many fingers am i holding up?
now , bruce .
thou shalt not tempt the lord ...
hey , if you can't do it , man , that's cool .
three .
two .
four .
nine .
six .
eight .
one .
okay .
how many now?
seven .
aha !
you've been doing a lot of complaining about me , bruce .
and quite frankly , i'm tired of it .
wait .
don't come near me .
when i'm backed into a corner , i'm like a wild animal .
i don't wanna hurt you , but i will , out of instinct .
you haven't won a fight ... since grade five , and that was against a girl .
yeah , but she was huge .
she had been held back .
and the sun was in your eyes .
oh , there you go .
in a way , i brought you here to offer you a job .
job?
what job?
my job .
you think you can do it better , so here's your chance .
when you leave this building , you will be endowed with all my powers .
whatever you say , pal .
okay .
that did not happen , and no one needs to hear about it .
i'm deleting the program .
no .
no .
i'm having a breakdown , that's what it is .
normal , everyday psychotic episode caused by a tumor or brain lesion .
come on .
start !
that was lucky .
come on , man .
calm down .
you did not meet god ; you do not have his powers .
if that was god , then i'm clint eastwood .
holy hell !
be careful what you wish for , punk .
no .
uh uh !
no .
no .
i am a reasonable , sane human being with a .
44 magnum , the most powerful handgun in the wo ...
i'm not clint eastwood .
i'm bruce nolan .
bruce nolan .
i'm bruce no lan !
oh , it's not real .
it's not real .
coffee?
yeah .
uh , coffee .
yeah .
we have a special on soup today .
no .
that's fine .
thank you .
it's tomato .
i made it myself .
okay .
okay .
excuse me .
i need a sp ...
it's okay .
i found one .
here's your soup .
oh , soup .
right .
uh , yeah .
right .
having fun?
thy ...
thou ...
come .
take a closer walk with me .
let me explain the rules .
rules?
yeah .
you left in such a rush , i didn't get a chance to explain .
two extra fingers freaked me out a little bit .
i just figured i'd get your attention .
i did the same thing to gandhi ; he didn't eat for three weeks .
anyway , here's the deal .
you have all my powers .
use them any way you choose .
there are only two rules .
you can't tell anybody you're god .
believe me , you don't want that kind of attention .
and you can't mess with free will .
uh huh .
can i ask why?
yes , you can !
that's the beauty of it !
this is amazing .
speaking of amazing ...
excuse me .
oh .
holy sh ... cow .
since you're through with these , i think i'll keep 'em .
might come in handy someday .
see you around , kid .
where you going?
i'm taking a vacation .
god doesn't take vacations , does he?
do ... ye?
did you ever hear of the dark ages?
besides , i'm covered .
you can clear everything up in five minutes if you want to , right?
ciao .
i've got the power " boom !
i've got the power
and he saw that it was good .
i've got the power
whoa .
gettin , gettin 'gettin'kind ofheavy
gettin , gettin 'gettin'kind ofheavy

oh , darn .
all this horsepower and no room to gallop .
heigh ho , silver , away !
i certainly wouldn't want to be a fugitive on the run with hank ,
buffalo's number one police dog on the job .
this is phil sidleman reporting from the police canine training center ,
channel 5 news .
and cut it .
hey hey !
look what the cat coughed up !
channel 7 , right?
you're the guy that went crazy?
i had a bad moment .
what are you doing here?
just looking for a story .
there's no story here .
this pond is all fished out .
pretty standard stuff anyway .
i don't know .
my instinct tells me there's something more .
yeah?
well , go with that .
it served you well in the past , right?
mm hmm .
hey !
hank found something !
hey , we got a body !
over here !
get the camera !
now !
it's locked , and the keys are inside !
i guess every dog has his day .
hey , kid .
you wanna make 10 bucks?
you know how to use one of these?
duh .
seems to be in tune .
let's do this .
the body ofjimmy hoffa was uncovered in a field today ... outside of a canine training center in buffalo , new york .
bruce nolan was the first on the scene .
thank you , jane .
as you can see behind us , the body is being carefully exhumed ... and will be transported to a medical facility , where d. n. a. testing can confirm the identity .
that , however , merely a formality at this point , as in a bizarre twist , the body was found buried with a birth certificate ... and complete set of dental records .
i'd call that a red letter day for any k 9 unit , but was that enough for old hank here?
no , sirree .
moments later , he busted a local news camera crew ...
with 220 pounds of marijuana .
i never saw it before , i swear !
i'm bruce nolan , and that's the way the cookie crumbles .
yeah !
did you like that?
yes .
thank you .
thank you .
hi , bruce .
oh , hi , susan .
good work .
i'm impressed .
jack , did you need me for something?
bruce !
bruce !
just the man i wanna see .
hey .
hoffa?
what are the odds of that?
what are the odds of that?
bruce , why don't you sit down?
okay .
i'm gonna be straight with you .
we want you back , bruce .
but i want you to understand it was not my decision to let you go .
when the big guy gives the order , you gotta ...
no harm , no foul , jack .
i needed some time to reassess my goals and get in touch with my true self .
you did that in a day?
imagine what i could do with seven .
look , bruce .
it is not in my power to give you anchor .
now , as far as field reporting goes , if you're looking for a bump ...
jack , let's just cut the crap and get down to brass tacks here .
i'm kidding with you , and you ...
i had you going , jackie .
don't even worry about it , old friend .
you just give me a camera , jack ; i'll give you the news .
a little less conversation a little more action
all this aggravation ain't" satisfactioning" me
my secret is that i let thejalapenos marinate ... in a spicy sauce for at least 24 hours before i stir it into the chili .
then i let it all come to a simmer b ...
oh !
hold that thought , hazel !
it seems as if an asteroid or some kind of meteorite ... has just hit ground right outside the mark twain chili cook off .
this should certainly spice things up a bit .
his stories are all over town .
from unearthing jimmy hoffa ...
to a meteor crashing to earth ...
bruce nolan is rapidly becoming known as ...
yeah a little less conversation a little more action
all this conversation ain't" satisfactioning" me
a little more bite and a little more bark
a little less fight and a little more spark
and that's the way the cookie crumbles !
was this bruce's idea?
uh huh .
he said he wanted me to have a day of beauty and luxurious serenity .
i gotta tell you .
he is really impressing me lately .
you know where he's taking me to dinner tonight?
hmm .
where?
the blue palm?
mm hmm .
oh , my gosh .
i just got chills .
i know .
and he told me to prepare for the most memorable night of our entire lives .
oh , my gosh .
grace , he's gonna propose .
stop it .
no .
really?
yeah .
really .
come on .
you do the math .
he sends you all day to a beauty spa .
he's taking you to the most romantic restaurant , where you had your first date .
you know , i never thought i'd say this , but bruce is right .
this is your big night .
relax and enjoy it .
oh , god .
ow .
ow .

more power outages reported today ... caused by last week's meteorite strike .
officials are desperately trying to repair several transformers ... damaged by the ensuing electrical surge .
the scene nearly turned violent when hundreds of disgruntled buffalo residents ... protested last week's lottery results .
and doomsayers are pointing to last week's strange celestial events ... as signs that prophesy is now being fulfilled ... and the world as we know it may be coming to an end .
world's gone mad .
bruce , 30 seconds to air .
okay .
okay .
there you are .
it's your big debut .
how are you feeling?

show must go on , right?

five seconds to the open .

born that way .
welcome to eyewitness news at 6 : 00 , with susan ortega ,
bruce nolan , fred donohue ... sports ...
dallas coleman ... weather .
and now , buffalo's number one news team .
i'm susan ortega .
i'm bruce nolan .
and here's what's making news .
what happened?
what the hell happened?
we lost power .
transformer's down again .
oh , geez .
ever since that damn meteorite hit .
it's okay .
we're back up .
we apologize for the interruption .
and now back to the news .
bruce .
thank you , susan .
i'm sorry .
we're going live to h. s. b. c. arena , where the buffalo sabres have won the stanley cup .
great .
fred .
we're about to uncork some champagne because ... the sabres have won their first championship in 22 years !
what in the blue blazes ...
we'll be back with the sabres 'stanley cup victory in just a hot second .
in other news ...
bloody hell !
for the love of god , what is it now?
the whole booth is down .
no , it's not !
in other news , fighting erupted in ... the gaza strip today , as israelis and palestinians ...
bruce .
we've got a situation here .
what?
they're rioting right outside the station .
you're kidding .
the whole town has gone crazy .
come on , bruce .
say something .
uh , ladies and gentlemen , this just in .
possibly ... the biggest breaking news story this town has ever seen .
and i gotta go .
i'm sorry , jack .
susan , it's all yours .
sabres !
sabres rule !

hello?
i need your help .
clap on .
clap on .
clap on !
clap on !
clap on !
figures !
well , hello there , bruce almighty .
not as easy as it looks , is it , son?
this god business .
they're all out of control .
it's mayhem .
i don't know what to do .
well , you're right on time ... 7 : 00 .
the seventh at 7 : 00 .
all righty then .
there we are .
it's good .
it's good !
it's a wonderful thing .
no matter how filthy something gets , you can always clean it right up .
there were so many , i just gave them all what they wanted .
yeah , but since when ... does anyone have a clue about what they want?
so what do i do?
parting your soup is not a miracle , bruce .
it's a magic trick .
a single mom who's working two jobs ... and still finds time to take her kid to soccer practice , that's a miracle .
a teenager who says no to drugs and yes to an education , that's a miracle .
people want me to do everything for them .
but what they don't realize is they have the power .
you wanna see a miracle , son?
be the miracle .
wait .
are you leaving?
yeah .
i see that you can handle things now .
but what if i need you .
what if i have questions?
that's your problem , bruce .
that's everybody's problem .
you keep looking up .
order has been restored in buffalo ... after this evening's downtown riot .
state officials have suspended all lottery sales ... pending further investigation .
no injuries were reported in the melee ; however , there were dozens ...
i've gotta be honest i think you know
we're covered in lies and that's okay
okay . " there's somewhere beyond this i know
well , thanks a million .
god bless .
oh , not a problem .
hope i can find the words to say
" never again , no " bruce giveth ... and bruce taketh away .
if you don't like it , megabyte me . " 'cause you're a god and i am not
and i just thought that you would know
evan .
bruce .
i suppose you're here to gloat about the anchor position .
go ahead .
take your best shot .
actually , i , uh ...
i just came to tell you that i've been a royal prick .
the anchor position is yours .
i turned down the job .
oh , and i never really congratulated you in the first place .
congratulations . " 'cause you're a god and i am not " thanks , bruce .
in the financial world , things are settling back to normal ... in what analysts are calling a fluke market fluctuation .
you made the right move , jack .
so what about you?
are you ready to go back out there?
and do the cutesy stuff?
the lighter side of the news?
lower and debase myself for the amusement of total strangers?
yeah , i could do that .
sounds like fun .
good .
okay , sammy , let's do it right , like all the other dogs .
i don't wanna make you feel bad , but they're laughing at you .
they're laughing at you .
come on .
concentrate .
there you go .
come on .
pump it out if you have to .
what am i gonna do with you?
i know this seems kinda crazy , but desperate times ... calls for desperate measures .
yeah .
okay .
okay , sammy .
do your thing .
