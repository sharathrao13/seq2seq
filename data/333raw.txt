the future ... has not been written .
there is no fate for what we make us for ourselves .
i wish i could believe that .
my name is john connor .
they tried to murder me , before i was born .
when i was 13 , they tried again .
machines from the future ...
terminators ...
all my life ... my mother told me the strom was coming .
judgement day .
the beginning of war between men and machines .
3 billion lives will vanish in a instance .
i would lead the war with the rest of human race and alternate victory .
it hasn't happended .
no bombs fell .
computers didn't take control ...
we stopped judgement day .
i should feel safe .
but , i don't .
so , i live off the grid .
no phone ...
no address ...
no one ... and nothing can find me .
i'd erased all connections to the past .
but , as hard i tried ...
i can't erase my dreams .
my nightmares ...
i feel the weight of the future bearing down on me .
a future i don't want ...
so , i keep running .
as fast as i can ...
anywhere ...
nowhere ...
beverly hllls

skynet
you're talking about skynet , aren't you?
skynet is the one of the digital defence systems develped by brewster's supervision .
oh ...
god !
oh ... my god !
of course !
oh !
my sense now ...
if you wouldn't come back when i was a kid ...
is ...
everything hadn't changed ...
she and i will have to got together , then ...
so , i'd met your father long time ago .
don't you see?
i ...
i don't understand that ...
your father ...
this is all about your father .
he is the key .
he always was ...
your father is one who can shut skynet down .
you see only one who ever could .
we have to get to him further t x does .
negative .
i can't drop on my mission .
this is your mission !
to save people !
my mission is to ensure the survival of john connor and catherine brewster .
i ...
i'm giving you an order !
i'm not programmed to follow your orders !
after the nuclear war , we have to leave .
nuclear war?
that doesn't have to be a war !
we can stop it !
it's an insufficient time .
the first launch sequences will be initiated at 6 : 18 pm .
what ...
today?
affirmative !
john , what is he saying?
judgement day ...
an end of the world .
it's today ... 3 hours from now .
2 hours and 53 minutes .
we must continue to south and mexico .
escape to the primary plascell's zone .
ooh ...
but , we have to get to her dad .
the mohalli area was sustained its significant nuclear fallout .
you will not survive .
you mean ... we may just go run and hide somewhere in a hole or other ... bombs fall?
it is your destiny .
fuck my destiny .
john !
you can not self terminate .
no .
you can't .
i can do whatever the hell i wanna do .
i'm an human being .
i'm not the god damn robot .
cyborgnetic organism whatever !
either , we go to her father ...
we get him to shut skynet down .
stop the ship from whatever happening .
or ... so much for the great john connor .
'cause , your future , my destiny ...
i don't want any part of it .
i never did .
based to your pupil dialation ... skin temperature , motor functions ... are calculated 83 % properbility ... did you will not trigger .
please ...
please do it as he said !
you have to save my father !
we can reach crs in approximately 1 hour ... depending on traffic conditions .
i ...
i can't get on line .
the whole works are down .
skynet is summoning control of global communications and prepration for its attack .
so ... this war is between people and machines ...?
why are you on our side?
the resistance captured me . and reprogrammed my cpu .
i was originally designed for assasination missions .
so ...
you don't really care for this mission successes or not .
if we get killed ... does that mean anything to you?
if you would die ...
i'll become useless .... don't be no reason for me to exist .
thank you for doing this .
your gratute aptitude does not be required .
i'm programmed to follow your commands .
her commands?
it was catherine brewster who had reactivated me and sent through time and space field .
what is exactly am i in the future of yours?
you're john connor's spouse and second in command .
oh ...
no !
what?
you're a mass !
yeah ! you're not exactly my type , either .
so , why didn't i send you back?
i'm not authorized to answer your question .
why didn't he send you back?
he was dead .
ooh ...
it well sucks ...
humans inevitably die .
yeah ...
i know .
so ... how was it?
no ... maybe i ...
i don't wanna know ...
how does he die?
john conner was terminated at july , 4th , 2032 .
i was selected for the emotional touchment he develped his modern number to do these boys of experiences .
this aided ... it a mastration ...
what?
what are you saying?
i killed you .
it has to be mistake .
until 11 : 00 , all primary military systems were secured .
they were !
only survailant sectors were infected .
internet , air traffic , power plant ...
that's all everything .
then , a few minutes ago , we've got the guidance computer bannable crash .
we gotta be communication error .
but , not it looks like a virus .
early morning , alaska was down .
what?
signal from hampers and satellite was scrambled and beyond ignitions .
what about the missile silos and subs?
we lost contacts .
do you got ...
did you say this is completely open to attack?
theoretically , we can be under attack already .
who's doing this?
some power or some computer hackering garage ...
we can't trace a virus and we can't pan it down .
some ... somebody he is we've never seen before it keeps growing and changing .
and , it's like an mind of its own .
this can't be happening .
sir ! the pentagon is on the secure line .
that's a chairman .
right .
look ...
none is gonna happen .
ok?
we can get to your dad ... and we can unplug the skynet ...
bomb won't fall .
you won't have to kill me someday ... will never gonna exist ...
you and i become ... go to the separate ways .
you know ...
mike crypy's basement .
how's first on my first kissed guy .
really?
you'll never be good ... if relief intention in the fear of death .
brewser !
well ... what's the hell you got the kind of solution for this?
i know what you're looking forward ... , sir !
but , skynet is not ready for this system wide connection .
that sounds a discovery on a kind of approximity over there which they just told me .
they say we didn't stop this stand by the virus .
now , i have a scanned certain out of performance and anxiety on you over there .
but , your boys are saying we will plug the skynet into all my systems .
and , it'll squash this thing like a bug .
and , give me my back control of my military !
mr. chairman !
i need myself very clear .
if we are uplink now , skynet will control your military .
but , you're in good at control of skynet !
right?
that is correct , sir !
then , do it !
and , brewster !
if your thing works ... you'll get over fundings you ever need .
yes , sir !
execute y/ n? _
sir?
shall we?
no .
it's my job , now .
skynet defence system now actlvated .
we are in !
passed the firewalls and local defence net in a minimum subs .
skynet is holding up rational processing at 60 terrablop per sec .
sir !
she should take less than a minute and find the virus program .
must pretty god this works .
skynet defence system now actlvated .
please ...
power failure?
no .
tony , what the hell is going now?
daddy !
kate !
what are you doing here?
daddy !
get away from him !
watch out !
daddy ! ...
daddy !
don't move !
she'll be back !
we should shut down skynet !
where is the system core?
somewhere in this building?
skynet !
the virus has defected skynet .
skynet is the virus !
it's the reason everything's falling apart !
skynet has become himeself weird .
in 1 hour , it will initiate a massive nuclear attack on this enemy .
what enemy?
us !
humans !
oh ...
god !
this machine's started to take over .
my office ... on this for us we do ...
the access codes are in my safe .
why are they killing everyone?
it destroyes any possible threat to skynet .
which ...

re ...
red in the half !
crystal pea ...
you have to get to crystal peak !
what?
what was he saying?
crystal peak !
52 miles north to east appearing 0 . 5 degrees .
that's the system core?

there was no system core .

the attack began at 6 : 18 pm ... just as he said it would .
judgement day
the day the human race has been really destoyed by the weapons they'd protect himself .
i should've realized .
our destiny was never to stop judgement day .
because , we knew it we will survival it .
together ...
the terminator knew it .
he tried to tell us .
but , i didn't want to hear it .
maybe , the future has been written .
i don't know .
all i know is what the terminator taught me .
never to stop fighting .
and , i never will .
battle was ... just began .
