yeah , i met him once .
his name is zip .
that's a great name , huh?
jack , you're a cop .
grand theft auto .

something like trump street , or trout street or ...
turk?
turk street?
yes , turk street .
turk street .
so tell missing persons .
they've got a list a mile long .
by the time they get to her , she'll be the age i wanted her to leave .
she'll be back .
three days , jack . " m really scared .
amy , " m ...
i know .
you're going on vacation , some music festival .
a week with you and your cello .
that'll be so different for you .
i know " m just your neighbor .
i had no business asking .
you have a great time , okay?
i was planning on blacking him out . " m glad i didn't .
it can't be that different from looking for a car , right?
turk street .
i'm sorry . " m sorry , you okay?
oh !
you mustn't bother .
it's no bother .
just get out of the rain .
come on .
so you don't live in the neighborhood .
no , " m looking for someone .
you can just set them down there .
no , no .
i'll take them in the kitchen .
well , this way .
thomas , we have a visitor !
don't be alarmed , we have a stranger in the house .
thomas , dear .
this is ...
jack .
jack friar .
this is mr. quarre , " m mrs. quarre .
who is it you're looking for , jack , a friend?
no , a suspect .
well , not a suspect really .
a young man .
you're a policeman .
i really should be going .
oh , dear , don't go .
i'll put on some water for tea .
thanks but i have to ...
we won't hear of you leaving .
i must thank you for your kindness .
now , it's lndian tea .
lndia lndians .
not the ones we beat the crap out of .
no , i really must go .
this one's made from hard wood ...
oak , mahogany .
i've got one made in africa from ivory .
maybe one of your cousins carved it , huh?
jack !
tell us about the suspect .
is he a lone operator or a member of some vicious gang?
he seems to be an operator .
yeah .
what does he look like?
i'll show you .
he had blond hair , blue eyes .
stand up .
stand up .
how'd you find me?
what?
i said , how did you find me?
find you?
who are you?
smart ass !
you like baseball?
its's just a tiny little bump , officer .
i checked it out .
ready for your tea?
i don't like tea .
well who does?
tea is for chinks , give him a real drink .
would you like a shot?
make it a mai tai .
that's what we drank in korea .
who are you people?
what happened here?
this cop showed up , looking for us .
me at least .
that's why we kept him here , boss , for you to decide .
what did you hit him with?
no guns .
no guns .
do i have to post a list of rules at the front door?
it might ... help .
has anyone else a gun?
sure .
finally got a hit , shit head .
come on , miller , knock him in !
listen , mister ...
...
quarre .
quarre .
its's an alias .
i really had a photograph , not of that psychopath .
but ...
shh , there's a game on .
thank you , dear .
don't gloat .
i'm not gloating , don't be a sore loser .
maybe he's onto us for seattle .
you shouldn't have let him see you .
i wasn'tjust going to let him walk out of here .
the questions are : what are we going to do with him?
what if there are more of him?
kill him .
we do not kill him .
because the penalties for killing are so distasteful .
yeah , that's easy for you to say .
he didn't have your picture .
he has no picture , hoop .
perhaps we should outfit you with a wooden club and a loincloth .
are you ...
are you calling me backward?
the best way to chase something , hoop , is to let it chase you .
greetings , erin .
business .
that's what you always say .
this is a business .
tell the old people the schedule's been moved up a day .
a day?
that's today .
that's why you'll want to hurry .
sorry .
you should try to have a calming influence on hoop ..
.. rather than a inflammatory one .
is it your place to tell me who not to inflame?
as a matter of fact it is .
with this rose , i thee wed .
all things in good time .
until then , ..
.. lover and loved .
pimp and whore .
coarseness does not become you .
that sick fuck .
it'll all be over soon .
all of it?
this job , our last .
you and him?
that over?
what do you mean?
you know what i mean .
he hurts you .
keeps us down .
i got to pack .
i'll help .
if tyrone sees you in my bedroom ...
we're just talking , for christ's sake .
okay .
later then .
hoop .
i never chose tyrone .
yeah , but sometimes you laugh at me with him .
he expects it of me .
don't you understand that?
fucking cop's listening .
hoop .
the cop's not our problem .
tyrone .
so we leave the airstrip no later than 8 pm .
don't smoke that in here .
i sure as hell won't miss you telling me what to do .
control freak .
control is a good thing , thomas .
you could do with more of it .
control that .
then we land in bermuda no later than 2 am .
correct?
aye aye , sir .
we refuel .. .. and hoop's piloting the balance of the journey to the caymans .
is he taking his meds?
yes , i assume so , why?
he asked me to teach him to fly , .. .. but " m not responsible if he flies off the handle .
i will control hoop .
how'd you know where to find us?
i didn't .
you're not who " m looking for .
i have a pict
yeah , right .
a picture with a guy with blond hair , blue eyes .
i'm looking for a girl .
oh , now it's a girl .
gee , you know i just can't keep your stories straight .
hoop !
stop it !
alright .
settle down .
these are too tight .
eventually " m going to be alone with you , cop .
get away from him .
is that better?
thanks .
there is a picture .
and there is a girl .
was it out of willfulness or out of stupidity you let him see you?
i'm sorry , tyrone .
but i think he seems to have seen you too .
no he hasn't .
it seems he's smarter than you .
she's like a spoiled child .
hateful towards those who take care of her .. .. and yet totally dependent .
leave her alone .
and hoop is the spoiled boy .
the spoiled boy , .. .. to whom i gave a future despite the metal plate in his head .. .. and the diagnosed psychosis .
now , hoop , .. .. was it the belle of tacos or the king of burgers .. .. which had most recently rejected your services?
what are you laughing at , cop? !
maybe it's good that our stay in these close quarters nears its end .
brunch is ready .
no , brunch is canceled .
the unexpected appearance by the officer has altered our plans .
excuse me .
i have been cooking since his god damned appearance .
no one said anything .
well , perhaps brunch is just what we need .
who would like to say the blessing?
how about our guest?
he should say a prayer .
leave him alone .
you have nothing to worry about .
i'm sure everything will go as planned .
i'll say the blessing .
thank you , lord , for that which we are about to receive ...
ten million dollars , amen !
you always forget the ketchup .
bring me a beer .
please .
no , thank you .
he's probably not used to eating a proper breakfast .
this is delicious .
remember you're flying , thomas .
i flew 57 missions in korea .. .. and i was drunk every damn time .
don't you tel  let him drink .
i'll fly the damn plane .
i'll let you co pilot , shut the fuck up while " m telling my story .
excuse me , dear , .. .. but nobody gives a titty about your story .
i don't want this punk interrupting me .
come on , old man !
you want to fly?
i'll let you fly .
come on .
come on .
first one's free .
are you children? !
must i put you in separate rooms?
take him into the kitchen .
you brought the cops .
shut up !
you defective little prick .
its's our banker friend .
delay him .
keep him out of the house .
your clothing is inappropriate .
go change it .
david .
what are you doing here?
i needed to see erin .
she left me a message , it's important .
she's not available just now .
where is she?
frankly i don't know .
i just came in from shopping .
i'm sure she'll get in touch with you later .
why don't you go back to your office?
if mr. quarre knew you were playing hooky .. .. he might not look so kindly on you dating his granddaughter .
david !
erin !
hey !
its's happening today .
what?
yeah , now .
why?
well , i don't know why .
but tyrone says it has to be .
look , i can't .
if you want us to be together , you have to .
go back to the bank and we'll see you soon , okay?
david , " m in the street in my robe .
look , i adore you .
thomas ! lsabelle !
if we're delayed , simply wait at the landing field .
keep your cell phone on in case of a problem .
erin !
you will stay and entertain our guest .
whoa , whoa , what about david?
he expects me .
i will deal with david .
hoop !
yeah .
good .
so , shall we?
take my bags , hoop .
both of them .
be available to take calls .
david may need to hear your devoted voice for reassurance .
you are art .
do not fade .
are you comfortable?
been better .
hey , you okay?
may i have some water?
water?
you look a little stressed .
look , miss ...
erin , please .
erin .
you need to let me go before that head case hoop comes back to kill me .
tyrone won't let hoop kill you .
tyrone is against killing .
so ...
do you want any kind of music?
you like some music?
look , miss , please ...
i can't let you escape , .. .. because then i would have to escape and no one escapes tyrone .
that's ridiculous .
is it?
this is how tyrone says you shouldn't have left .
its's alright , i get ten percent off my pedicures now .
are you taking your medication?
why?
you appear agitated .
yeah , well you piss me off .
they got a medication to make you stop doing that?
what do you plan on doing with your share of the money?
i want ... to breed dogs ..
.. back in utah .
excellent !
is there a young lady in the picture?
maybe there is , maybe there isn't .
d
david brewster .
we're here .
hoop is beginning .
why are we doing this today?
what?
what did you say?
i need an explanation .
your explanation will be your share of the money .
is erin there?
no she's not .
but i have complete faith .. .. you will be able to swindle your bank without her .
just make sure you're available for me when i enter .
you don't look so good .
that's because you're used to looking at you .
maybe that drink wasn't such a good idea .
what should i do?
what should you do?
find that picture so you can see i was telling the truth .. .. and you can tell your friends .
i'll look a lot better when " m not waiting for someone to kill me .
alright .
listen , i couldn't find the picture .
okay , i walked the whole block .
hey !
oh , god .
please , don't die .
don't die , please .
shit !
shit !
how you doing , leatherhead?
i got the generator set up in case this storm messes with the lights .
how's it look?
oh , it looks great .
i've been thinking about some of those missions ...
has the plane been fueled?
yes .
and i'll be here just as long as you need me .
excuse me , sir .
i put your kit in the fridge .
you could have let me die .
cop dead from a diabetic coma .
its's perfect .
dump the body somewhere .
nobody would ever know " d been kidnapped .
i guess i owe you one .
i mean that .
i noticed your suitcases were packed .
were you supposed to be somewhere else today?
not on turk street .
like where?
the berkshires .
fantasy camp for frustrated musicians .
basketball junkies go to michael jordan's basketball clinic .
i get my fix playing with yo yo ma .
your apartment struck me as lonely .
don't cops dream?
nightmares mostly .
i don't trust you leaving here without seeing erin .
then by all means you should call her for reassurance .
i trust she's at home .
women talk .
some excessively .
yes?
we got problems .
the system is patched into a backup power source .. .. that's more complicated than i thought .
can you deactivate it?
yeah , yeah , yeah . " m working on it .
its's just going to take some time .
how much?
i don't know .
two , three minutes tops .
do it !
did i hear what i just heard?
i was a state sponsored prodigy until moscow collapsed .
my peers became prostitutes , musically or otherwise .
i met a man in a bar .
tyrone became your ticket out .
he said he saw my potential .
i flattered myself he meant my music .
so you guys are robbing a bank , right?
how?
just smile .. .. as you tell me about the federal reserve .
you really don't know who we are?
i'm just a cop who finds stolen cars .. .. who's looking for a lost girl .
and look , you found one .
you are not lost .
it would take a search party to find me .
what are you doing?
stand .
ladies and gentlemen , please calm down . " m sure the problem will be fixed momentarily .
send the money .
send the money !
send the money !
sir , " m sorry , " m sure the problem is just momentary .
i don't have moments .
tell your officer to wire my loan immediately .
we wire funds electronically .
our computers are down ...
well , to hell with your computers !
my funds must be sent by 6 o'clock .
i'm afraid that if wiring the funds is an impossibility ...
have you heard of this device?
can it not be used with your approval to transfer funds?
sir , please , please just calm yourself .
if you'll just step into my office .
would you mind?
do you know " chanson triste " by du parc?
do you like being tied up in a chair?
or would you rather play some beautiful music?
how much are we talking about?
ten million .
our spread is substantial .
it went to committee .
now , think lender liability , sirs .
if those funds aren't in escrow by day's end .. .. my company will lose a one hundred million dollar contract .
so consider that to be your true exposure .
my laptop is charged .
i could modem it through .
i'm calling my lawyer .
sir , that won't be necessary .
get the laptop .
i missed a few notes .
that's a nice piece .
i never played it before .
i know what i want for saving your life .
what's that?
they say playing the cello is like dancing .
show me .
how?
you'd have to put the gun down .
its's crazy .
i believe in the concept of a man and a woman .
and the man owing her one .
i mean , you did say that , didn't you?
that you owe me one .
don't do this .
damn you .
put your hand on mine .
a.
d.
g.
i could break your neck .
i should .
yeah , you should .
are we done?
yeah , we're done .
we're even .
mr. abernathy , this disk contains all the routing information , .. .. account numbers and passwords .
its's your authentication .
great , just a little more paperwork .
now , ..
.. about erin .
he insists on meeting erin at his place .
we don't have time for this .
do we know where the banker lives?
yeah , it's over the mountain .
its's a haul .
you've been there?
i drove her a couple of times .
i thought they used to meet in restaurants .
well , maybe he cooks .
go there .
tyrone called .
he said it could be another couple of hours .
i sent willy for dinner .
tyrone?
and you trust him?
this job is no different from seattle .. .. or sydney or dallas or miami .
and he still needs us .
unless he thinks he can take a bus to the caymans .
but this is our last one .
then he wouldn't have called .
do you think we'll be happy in fiji?
we can have sex on the beach .
oh thomas !
let's go wait in the airplane .
you know i won't have sex on airplanes .
but this one's on the ground .
when was he leaving the bank?
he should have been here 45 minutes ago .
she gabs on the phone , even as the outcome remains unsettled .
not even you would be that dim witted .
maybe the two of them are working together .
get out of the car .
what?
get out of the car .
why?
watch for him .
hey , it's raining out here !
then go inside .
get in !
but there was a accident .
i don't want to hear about it .
get in !
you see that?
what?
this !
this !
this !
this !
just how would he find you?
not by looking .
he knows where " d go .
he can hear me think .
what would he do when he found you?
maybe he'd kill me .
maybe you could prevent that from happening .
maybe ...
maybe he and hoop are coming back to kill you .
you worked your way partially free from the bonds .
you'd have no choice but to kill them in self defense .
so give me the gun .
we could wind up with ten million dollars .
you know what happens to cops who have ten million dollars .
they eat their service revolvers .
they can't ...
open your mind , jack .
you're more than a cop .
i'm more than a thief .
you'd know that if you're paying attention .
i have been .
and i know .
erin?
where is she?
erin !
hey , banker boy !
what are you doing in my house?
you should thank him .
look what a splendid effort he made infiltrating your bank today .
where's the disk?
ahh gee , it's locked !
there's no fucking disk !
where is it?
hey , what's this , huh?
go ahead , .. .. it's password protected .
okay !
okay !
okay !
but i just risked everything for erin .
you think " m going to blab now just to get out of a beating?
well ... tick tock .
what time is it?
they haven't called .
must've left you behind .
or should i say they left your ass?
they wouldn't .
no , and a fine ass it is .
you can keep sitting on it until my cop friends start looking for me .
or you can cut me loose , come in with me and tell what happened .
damn !
what?
what?
bastard !
i'm to blame now?
go ahead , but that still doesn't change the facts .
they didn't need you and left your ass .
shush !
god !
hello?
why has the phone been occupied?
i'm sorry , i didn't even know it was off the hook .
why didn't you check it?
how could i know it was off the hook?
your friend here insists on seeing you .. .. before he gives us our information .
you must have fucked your way into his heart .
hoop's on his way for me .
i have to get ready .
so this is your first crime?
yeah .
no embezzlement , no juggling ...
no .
nothing .
not even as a kid?
no shoplifting , no peeping tom?
hardly .
so this really is your inauguration .
take my advice ...
you know , i stole my dad's car once .
really?
yeah .
drove it to mexico .
what happened?
drove it off a cliff .
never even told my father .
apparently , driving isn't one of your talents .
come on in here !
come on !
jack , please .
come on !
keep coming .
come on , pick up the phone !
what are you doing?
pick it up !
pick this up !
i can make it look like he died escaping .
don't .
now you go get some more rope .
remember what's to happen later .
tyrone .
not until we have the disk and the password .
just me .
just you .
how fetching you look , my dear .
perfect for a late date .
david !
erin !
i tried to be there but he left without me .
quick , what's the password?
we need some time together .
well , there's no time .
well , certainly a short interlude can be squeezed in for young lovers .
give me the gun .
give them fifteen minutes , no more .
i did it !
i did it !
i knew you could .
come here , come here .
not giving tyrone the password was so smart .
god , who knows what he would have done if i wasn't here .
so what is it?
oh no , no , no . " m going to the caymans with you .
you cannot be seen with tyrone .
not now , not ever .
i'm only going to be gone for a few days .
then we can go away together like we planned .
i don't think i can wait any longer .
oh , you poor thing .
as soon as we get the money .
i promise .
enough promises .
oh , shit .
i was dreaming , ..
.. we were on this beach .
i looked wonderful in my bikini .
yes?
what the hell are you pulling?
our young friend became difficult .
difficult?
you haven't seen difficult , i have .
you try a battalion of gooks squirting napalm up your butt .
that is difficult !
... and you've been aptly rewarded .
now you listen to me , ass face !
the bank could still figure this thing out .
hoop !
banker boy !
did you have fun , huh?
your time's up , " m sorry .
stop it !
did you have a good time?
was your dick hard?
stop it !
you fuck !
you're unbelievable !
its's not his fault , it's my fault !
shut up !
stay out of this !
this is not about you !
stay there !
what's the matter romeo?
having a little trouble with your pants?
let me help you !
fuck !
fuck !
you fuck !
what are you going to do , huh?
you stupid ...
please stop , please !
i told you , stay out of it !
i don't want to hurt you !
fuck !
you want to dance? " m sorry , did that hurt?
stop it !
did that hurt?
get up !
here , come on !
come on !
come on !
come on , banker boy !
you little pussy !
she's mine !
stop it !
she's mine !
tyrone !
tyrone !
you have to hurry !
hoop's gone crazy !
he's killing david !
he couldn't stop him !
he couldn't !
he just snapped !
his fifteen minutes were up .
did you get the password?
you?
no , i didn't get the password , because i was too busy fucking him !
can you think of any reason i shouldn't let you hang?
tom !
tom !
its's looking fierce out there !
we better take care of the lights !
don't worry , darling .
i'll do it .
thomas , go get your slicker .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
we'll give it one more hour .
maybe it's ..
.. e r l n.
password accepted .
it might be the quarres .
continue north , hoop .
what about the plane?
we don't need a plane .
we'll be driving to our destination .
i see no reason to share this .. .. with that boorish man and that insipid woman .
our shares will increase accordingly .
is somebody planning on telling me where we're going?
we're driving to albany , .. .. new york , where " ve cultivated some banking relationships .
then what?
then a mere three hour drive to the canadian border .
i need to use the bathroom .
you should have done that back at the house .
i didn't know that back at the house !
we have a six hour drive to albany .
and if we're not out of the country by 2 pm , .. .. you'll have no pot to piss in .
we need to get gas anyway .
fill it up quickly and check the tires .
erin , do me a favor .
wipe off the dead banker .
tyrone .
the cop had this .
he wasn't looking for hoop .. .. for beating up some clerk in seattle , he was looking for you .
maybe i shouldn't have told you .
tell him .
i arranged for you to get the gun .
he wants you to kill the cop .
yeah .
but it's not what we want .
yeah .
okay .
what?
tire .
... in the middle of nowhere .
why have you stopped here?
i'm going to check the spare in the trunk .
what do you mean the spare?
didn't i tell you to check it back at the gas station?
any last words , brainiac?
i'll spare you my wisdom , you'll forsake it anyway .
oh no please , " m sure i'll miss it .
i'll look at your life as a novel , ..
.. this being the tragic moment .. .. at which , in the ultimate irony , .. .. our headstrong hero shoots himself in the brain .
so let me get this straight : you're my brain?
not only that , " m also the restraint that you lack .
stand back .
without me , you would be in prison or worse .
you really think you would thrive so without me?
witness tonight .
because i wasn't standing right beside you .. .. you killed a man .
and once you shoot me , you'll have killed two men today .
and the cop , three .
do you imagine that erin will ride into the sunset with you?
shut that music off !
turn it down !
okay !
okay !
hoop !
what are you doing?
nothing .
our friend only got a little overexcited .
its's better now , isn't it?
yeah .
get in the car .
not you .
were you behind this?
you told me to give him the gun .
so the policeman really is after me?
yes .
we'll see .
an unfortunate detour , " m afraid .
i need the gun .
no .
use another method .
i've seen that you can .
go .
hoop , wait !
well , now my dear , .. .. witnessing an execution you caused is only going to be awkward .
what could you possibly say to the man?
cop !
i told you " d be back .
i hope you know how to die fast .. .. because we need to be in albany by eight .
you know how to die fast?
die fast , cop .
fast .
faster !
faster !
faster !
faster !
faster !
faster !
faster , cop !
spare yourself the effort .
we lack time , so forgive my brevity .
were you carrying a photograph when you stumbled upon our house?
yeah .
now look at me .
was the picture of me?
was this the picture?
that wasn't the picture , that wasn't the fucking picture !
leave him alone !
the truth is it hardly matters .
a killing has already occurred .
not just this one but another man as well .
so the stakes have been raised .
it does make sense to clean up loose ends .
and " m a loose end .
the loosest .
erin ...
come here .
now , just put your finger there .
easy , this is your baptism .
you think 'cause you've already killed somebody , killing me is no big deal?
you kill me and every cop on the planet takes a sudden vacation .
you become the case that never closes , the guy they never stop huntin '.
you be job one .
pay attention , erin , 'cause this applies to you , too .
when they catch you , wherever they catch you .. .. they're going to subdue you .
and they're going to subdue you substantially .
then they're going to tell you to run .. .. and that's going to confuse you , 'cause you never heard that before .
then your animal brain's going to kick in with the survival mode .
hey , they're letting me go " .
so you'll run .
and then what?
then they shoot you , dumb ass .
well , don't you think they have to catch me first?
oh , you're thinking all that money is going to help you hide?
that's funny , 'cause those shit for brains over there told me about your .. .. time frame .
now , if you planned on driving to albany in six hours , .. .. that means you're going to use the new jersey turnpike .
and you're probably going to drive at night .
but now you're late .. .. and you hadn't counted on rush hour .
so if you think you're still going to make that drive in six hours .. .. you got another thing coming .
dearest , i don't remember hearing anything about albany .
i knew it !
you dirty double crossing bastard !
put it down .
nobody's trying to cross you , thomas .
give him the disk .
now .
oh , god !
what have i done?
oh , god !
this is a well oiled machine !
look , why don't you take me with you?
what?
you can't get the money on your own , but you can with my help .
my car's got flashing lights and a siren , .. .. l can still get you to albany in time .
you get as much of the money as you can , .. .. l drive you to the border , you go across .
hey , you promise me a share , maybe i'll cross with you .
and then what?
i need some more insulin .
.. when we get across we let the girl decide who she wants to go with .
you propose driving through a busy city with a captive policeman .
you must think me a foolhardy man .
take a turn at the next corner .
left .
now left again .
i thought we were going to the freeway .
turn again .
left .
go there .
out of the car , both of you .
further .
here .
so how do you move ten million dollars?
send the money to a number of banks .
in amounts small enough not to draw attention .
hey .
why don't you try and get some sleep .
oh , man !
its's worse than i thought .
hey , hang on , it's going to be bumpy .
nicely done !
oh , man .
hey .
are you going to shoot me in the back while " m driving?
mr. leeds , please .
yes .
can you hold please?
yes , i'll hold .
so tyrone , who's going in to grab the money .
me?
don't be absurd .
i trust you no more than i trust her .
yes , mr. clifford leeds , please .
this is mr. leeds .
welcome back , mr. abernathy .
its's been so long since we've seen you .
one more thing , " m a bit ill .
would it be possible for me to pick up the checks at the drive through?
sure , if that's a problem ...
not at all .
i'll alert the teller to watch for you .
she'll know me by my chauffeur , a very earnest looking black man .
okay , thank you , clifford .
good morning .
mr. abernathy .
mr. leeds said to be expecting you .
excellent !
have a good day .
thank you .

jesus , i get ld'd trying to deposit a check .
at my own bank !
where to next , tyrone?
continue straight , i'll tell you when to turn .
red light !
red light !
damn .
we had the right of way !
you asshole !
i'm actually beginning to trust you , officer .
enough to take that gun out of my back?
no , ..
.. but this much .
hey , how are you holding up?
fine .
you are going to give her her share before we cross the border , right?
once we cross , .. .. you can either go with me , go with him .. .. or go your own way .
good morning .
good morning .
i believe you have some checks for me .
mr. abernathy .
abernathy?
yes .
watch your hand .
thank you .
you're welcome .
move it .
oh damn .
what?
don't look .
don't look .
that teller .
she's making the security guard write down our license number .
can we do this quickly?
we have time to make it to another bank .
its's not worth the risk .
now , then , let's go to the border .
we cool?
we're cool .
you're going to have to lose the shotgun .
its's essential to our understanding .
i'll just cover it .
give me the map , erin .
you've done excellent work , officer friar .
perhaps you'd like to stay in my employ ...
jack !
you don't have to kill him , please !
i'm okay !
don't move , jack !
i'm alright .
tyrone !
give yourself up !
halt !
police !
jack , don't kill him !
tyrone !
its's over , there's no place to go !
freeze !
let go of me !
put it down !
put it down now !
do it !
step away from the car , both hands up !
please , remain in your car !
you understand that while under canada's jurisdiction .. .. we respect your interest in this situation .
no warrants or reports have been made as of yet .
we'll wait for your recommendation .
lucky thing having those license plates behind you .
tell them i was a hostage .
its's the truth .
i tried to leave him , you know .
i tried to leave him .
i couldn't .
i've got a million dollars right here .
you've got yours .
we could spend our lives on vacation .
the same vacation .
you have a way of making me feel really good ..
.. when you want something .
its's not like that .
oh , but it is .
only you don't know it .
when we danced the cello ..
.. you could have killed me .
whatever you saw in me then , see it now .
help me , jack .
arrest her .
