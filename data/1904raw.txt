no talking in the ranks , karlberg !
let's maintain proper behaviour in the ranks , boys .
you're not allowed here . but i want to see you .
can i ask you something? yes . will you come and watch tomorrow? do you want me to?
will you win? lf you come i'll win .
do you have the guts?
do you dare win?
the winner of the 200 metre freestyle is erik ponti from class 3 : 5 .
so now there's only the 300 metre freestyle left .
it's between you and lewenheusen .
what are you doing to do? what do you mean? are you going for it?
should i let lewenheusen win?
more sportsmanlike not to enter the race !
this is not about being sportsmanlike .
haven't you understood that? this is stjrnsberg . hey , boys !
just thought i'd check that no one falls before the last hurdle .
we've got them !
be careful not to get disqualified at the start . everything has already been decided . for that very reason .
show them ! what'll happen if i win? you'll be untouchable .
i promise .
it's a matter of honour for me .
get set .
go .
the over all champion and holder of three new school records , erik ponti !
hello there ... l'm decorating the tree . l can see that .
i can see that you're decorating the tree .
erik ...
my darling , welcome home .
i've missed you so much !
how is my little boy?
you look so grown up . doesn't he?
but what the hell is he wearing?
you look like a tram driver .
doesn't he?
you look lovely , really lovely .
look . but what happened to you there? nothing .
here .
it's wonderful .
we'll keep it here .
are you hungry?
we'll be eating in a minute .
father has taken food back from the restaurant .
venison .
this is very good .
how many straight a's have you got?
but what the hell is all this?
c for behaviour?
how does our " stjrnsbergian " explain that?
has it got something to do with all the weekend detentions?
just think , you won the school championships in swimming .
but my dear , that's not what we're bloody talking about , is it?
do you have an explanation?
i didn't want to be some errand boy for the sixth formers .
oh , i see .
what did you want to be then? left in peace . what?
left in peace .
ln peace ...
so you thought your mother should sell off her heirlooms  so you could be left in peace . ls that it? no .
that's not what you meant .
what then?
i'm not understanding anything .
how many do you want , erik?
thank you .
look how wonderful it looks .
pommes duchesse , marvellous .
erik , you know whenever there's something i don't understand  we have to have a talk after dinner .
that's what we'll do .
but ... have some , darling , start .
haricots verts ... how delicious !
there we are ...
we're friends again . friends again ...
marja !
marja !
hello , pierre . thanks for the record .
sounds good ! what's this? open .
lf you're going to be a lawyer you'll need one of these .
not that it applies in this school , but nonetheless .
swedlsh law
it's quite strange when you think about it .
school rules shouldn't be above the law of the land , should they? !
no , thanks .
you there !
what? l haven't done anything . don't give me any lip .
come here .
no , i won't . you'll have to stand in the corner . why?
i haven't done anything . come to the council at 19 . 00 .
understood?
how did it go?
what did they say? three weekend detentions . why?
i gave them lip , refused the pepperpot .
the next time : the ring !
no fun thumping a coward and an intellectual .
room search !
stand up straight , tanguy ! what the hell are you doing? stand up straight , tanguy !
stand up straight , tanguy !
look at me !
good .
it looks like we have a bed wetter here .
be ready in an hour , tanguy !
don't you understand what this is about?
they're trying to get at you .
they've just changed their tactics .
good day , sir !
good day , sir ! erik !
l've got an idea about the training . l'm not going to swim any more . what?
you can't do that . yes i can .
but ... you're the best swimmer we've ever had .
you said i'd be untouchable .
that it was a matter of honour for you .
but there's no honour here .
you know that .
there are many different ways of making life hell for people .
hello ! you're not allowed to be here . don't you want to talk to me? of course i do , but it's too risky . l don't give a damn about them . l'm thinking about myself as well .
i don't want to lose my job and you could be expelled .
wait .
i'm sorry , erik .
it's not possible .
not now .
rat !
come up for an inspection .
rat ! ln here .
good that you could come , rat .
we need an independent witness .
fatty here is just about to admit he's been smoking on the sly . no ! lf you hit him , you'll be expelled . that's quite right .
paragraph 13 .
smoking indoors is also enough for immediate expulsion .
paragraph 7 .
who's going to prove that?
a rat and a pig?
shit , dahln , it's like a bloody zoo in here !
now about that confession .
it's about time you stubbed out your cigarette for good .
here .
stub it out , you coward !
what?
let's see if it hurts as much as you think .
with your permission , in front of witnesses .
with any bloody permission you like .
you haven't got the guts , have you?
get dressed , tanguy !
present yourself in the ring tomorrow at 19 . 00 .
you know ...
none of this really needs to happen .
lf everyone just followed the rules .
everything would be easier .
that's what rules are for .
why should your friend have to suffer  just because you think you are above everyone else .
you should give some thought to that .
come on .
silverhielm is cruel .
he's an evil human being .
but why?
was he born like that or has he been here too long , maybe beaten as well ...
that's how the system works , isn't it?
kicked around in the lower form?
revenge later on ...
that's why it just continues .
does it hurt?
i just know that people like silverhielm have to be fought .
someone like him must never win .
not now or ever .
that's it !
have you seen pierre? no . have you seen pierre? no . have you seen pierre? ! not since the maths class .
ls it true he's been called to the ring tonight?
you don't have to do it .
it doesn't matter what you say .
i've already decided .
l'm going to do it . why?
otherwise it'll just carry on . lf i do it now , maybe they'll leave me alone .
wasn't that what you said yourself?
might as well get it out of the way .
but you're not like me , pierre .
i can fight .
not a bit , more than you can imagine !
i've been fighting my whole life , and once you've done that it never ends .
but help me then .
show me !
teach me how to fight . you can't learn to fight . why?
am i too weak?
it's not about that .
it's completely different .
something in your head .
let's forget it .
i'll take the pepperpot and i'll clean their bloody shoes .
you don't seem to understand .
it's too late .
how is it going to help , you getting beaten up?
how do you know i will?
get beaten up ...
you're not the only one who can fight .
people like silverhielm must disappear . who said that? l wish i could take your place .
what?
why?
do you think you're better than me?
maybe silverhielm was right .
you like putting yourself above the rest of us .
because you keep quiet when they burn you with a cigarette .
that's sick !
so what do you want me to do?
it doesn't matter what you say .
i'm going into the ring anyway .
okay , be an idiot then !
flght , flght , flght !
pierre tanguy , come and get your punishment !
come on , tanguy !
come on , little piggy !
tanguy , tanguy , tanguy !
will you do as you're told from now on , or carry on being cheeky?
do you promise to do as you're told? no , you coward , you bloody swine ! what did you call me? a swine !
a stinking swine ! can we hear that again? " shittyhielm !
one more time?
shittyhielm !
on your knees !
get down on your knees !
never !
what's the time? almost 9 . have you had any sleep? yes , a bit .
you got in a good punch there .
have you been practising on the quiet?
no .
i just lashed out , sort of .
don't worry .
i'll have a word with silverhielm .
this is going to stop .
i have to go to my house arrest now .
see you tonight .
will you be okay?
erik ...
see you later .
yes , see you later .
rat !
one of the boys in 2 : 5 is sick , so you must do his punishment duties . but i have to go up to house arrest . don't give me lip !
here ...
these have to be put into the ground in a 2x2 metre square .
firm as a rock ! then you can go to your arrest . yes .
good .
get to work !
a thousand and one nlghts
you can go and have some food now .
no .
let me go !
let me go !
i hope you put the stakes in properly .
we'll take your dick last of all .
how does it feel , then?
are you scared?
i'm never going to be scared of you , " shittyhielm .
start with the warm water .
pour it on !
le'ts boll rat !
boll rat !
pour it on !
pour it ! l don't want to !
looks like you need cooling down , rat ! cold water !
let him stay there .
we can't leave him there .
he'll freeze to death .
you shut up !
are you cold? yes , a little .
dear erik , by the time you read this letter , i'll have left stjrnsberg .
don't think i'm a coward .
i tried to hold out for as long as i could .
there is so much i want to say , but the taxi is coming in a minute .
anyway , i want you to know that you're the best friend i've ever had .
lf you like you can write to me at my mother's address in stockholm .
your affectionate friend , pierre .
ps .
i didn't have space for my works of strindberg and the gramophone .
please make full use of them .
come in !
hello , erik . hello .
am i disturbing? no .
you've been lying here for four days .
shouldn't i ask matron to look at you?
no .
i feel much better .
the rumours are flying .
i've heard that ... ... silverhielm went over the top this time .
what exactly happened?
nothing .
very sad about pierre .
it really is .
what kind of freaks are you?
don't you understand what you've done?
pierre was one of the most gifted students we've ever had here .
you and he were close friends , erik .
couldn't you have defended him?
why didn't you defend him?
at least give me an answer !
why didn't you defend him?
are you as cowardly as the others?
you get expelled if you fight with a council member .
the thing that separates humans from animals  is not only intelligence , it's also morality .
the ability to know the difference between good and evil .
you have all behaved like animals .
like vultures .
it's undignified !
do you hear me?
undignified !
this has to stop .
i don't think sir understands exactly what's happened here .
that'll be all for today .
thank you .
the ring in one hour .
bring von schenken with you .
after much deliberation , rat has decided to accept the challenge .
teach him a lesson in the true spirit of stjrnsberg .
you may start .
i've got a question .
do i have to hit both or is it enough if one crawls out?
it's over once you crawl out , or ... if both punisment prefects crawl out .
good .
just one more question .
can i hit them as much as i like? fight ! l was thinking about you , dahln .
i thought i might break your nose . and you !
left or right handed?
right handed .
very well .
i'll break your left arm at the elbow .
don't talk so bloody much , rat !
we said the nose , didn't we?
crawl !
you too .
crawl !
crawl !
hello .
i'd like to talk to marja .
can you ask her to come out?
marja doesn't work here any more . what?
she got fired .
three days ago .
they had no proof , but apparently they didn't need any .
what do you mean , fired?
for what?
you should know .
... and because linn called this groupe cryptogams  with crypto indicating " hidden " or " obscured " .
this gives us " hidden wedding " or " hidden fertilization " .
erik ... erik ! yes? are you alright? l'm fine .
and then we have the other group , phanerogams ...
von leiven .
vinberg .
ponti .
ponti has a letter from finland .
room search !
i found it !
this is even better than i thought .
don't worry about me getting with child with you .
that prostitute can't even put it in proper swedish ! " with child with you !
i had my diaphragm on . " the stopper on her head , not in her cunt? !
eh?
i'm sorry it all went so wrong .
but i suppose it's both of our fault .
maybe it's true i love you , but not that i think we'll meet again .
i don't think so either !
you've fucked the kitchen whore !
when the headmaster sees this you'll be expelled straight away !
stretch your legs a bit !
and now sit down , gentlemen . not you , ponti !
go to the headmaster straight away !
take your things !
gentlemen !
it's november , the 6th of november to be precise , 1632 , ltzen .
dense fog before us .
come in .
lf i understand things right , you've been having long term problems ... ... finding your feet at stjrnsberg .
ls that right?
well , the school rules are very clear on these matters .
i have no alternative but to expel you without matriculating from your year .
i would prefer to have you off school premises  shall we say by 1 5 . 00 tomorrow .
it's my duty to inform your parents  but i assume you'd prefer to have a word with them first .
the letter , may i have it back?
what are you going to do with it? her address .
i'd like to write to her .
the best thing you can do know is to forget about that girl .
when you read this i have left ...
l tried for as long as i could ...
one thing i want you to know ...
best friend i ever had .
maybe it's true i love you , but not that i think we'll meet again .
stop !
only members of this school are allowed to eat here .
hello?
who is it?
erik , hello?
erik , is it you?
it's just the two of us now , silverhielm .
it's 2 kilometres to the stable and even further to the school .
you could make a run for it .
you're fairly quick .
lf you go now , it'll take me 100 metres to catch up with you . what the hell are you talking about? down on your knees ! you're bloody mad . l said , down on your knees !
what do you want?
money?
i'll give you 10 000 .
my word ! 1 0 000? ! ls that all you're worth? l'll give it to you tomorrow . l swear on my honour as a nobleman . your honour as a nobleman?
where was that when you tortured pierre?
and when you struck me?
you did everything to provoke me .
don't you understand the living hell i had to endure with you?
that ring , give it here !
it's the sort of thing they use to identify a rotten old corpse .
and the teeth , of course .
you won't enjoy having all your teeth out , but you won't feel a thing ...
are you mad?
they'll give you a life sentence in prison .
i've thought everything through .
no proof once i've burnt your clothes !
only pierre and marja will know about it .
i won't tell anyone else .
did you really think i was going to kill you?
i'm not like you , silverhielm .
i'm not like you .
gunnar ekengren lawyer
three cheers ...
dear colleagues ...
i'm extremely moved by all this kindness .
and i'd very much like to say on behalf of my wife and myself ...
i think we have a visitor .
ponti?
still here?
i thought we had concluded any remaining business . lt was the thing about the letter . maybe i didn't make myself clear .
some things have not been acceptable in the sense of existing legislation ... what are you talking about? my right to privacy was violated .
lf you keep the letter , it's a criminal act according to swedish law .
what are you trying to say?
leave the school premises immediately ! do you hear? excuse me if i'm interrupting things . who are you? this is my lawyer .
the name is ekengren .
good day to you , gentlemen .
well , this is a rather sorry tale for everyone involved , you might say .
i've just had a long telephone call with a good friend , a reporter .
who happens to work for this newspaper .
he was very interested to hear about erik's story .
ln fact he'd like to come and write a reportage on this school .
and perhaps flesh out erik's story a bit more .
however , you may not feel this sort of publicity will be of benefit ...
i'm rather busy at the moment .
perhaps we could ...
the legal implications are already clearly set out here .
i don't know what you think , erik?
could we possibly avoid making this a police matter? maybe . excuse me , what is all this about?
lf all the information has not been squarely placed in front of me , then ...
surely headmaster has access to all the information?
as i say , if there are certain circumstances  to which i have not been alerted  then naturally i would like to be told of them .
lf you'll all excuse me .
have some cake in the meantime ! alma ...
the letter ...
may i have it back?
thanks .
behave for the rest of the term and get in touch when you come back .
it's not my hope but rather my conviction  that you'll go into life bearing something  that we proudly call the stjrnsberg spirit .
good luck !
now it all begins .
good luck !
erik , if you see pierre give him my regards .
erik , take care of yourself .
with these reports you'll get into any sixth form college you like .
but a d in general behaviour !
ls that heading in the right direction?
i mean , before you had a c.
and now you have a d.
what's your explanation?
ls it that finnish whore?
we've heard all about it .
she was a waitress , just like you .
we'll talk this over after dinner .
what's the matter with you?
what are you staring at?
what the hell are you staring at?
what are you staring at?
you're coming with me !
erik !
i'm sorry .
let's get this out of the way . please ! what's going on here? now listen to me !
it's over .
you're getting out of here .
ln half an hour you're going to be in hospital .
you won't see , your nose will be snapped , your arms will be broken .
you won't dare tell anyone .
you'll say that you fell down the stairs .
lf you get the police involved , they'll find out what you've been doing to us .
this is going to hurt a hell of a lot .
you'll be screaming until you pass out .
i swear i'm really going to do it .
people like you have to be destroyed .
this is the last time , then never again .
i thought you'd be in savolaks by now . where are you going? to geneva .
another school .
business . l thought you wanted to write . many things one wants to do !
you?
i've got a job in a legal firm over the summer .
as a messenger boy . l have to pay for my private tuition . forget that .
we're friends . lt makes no difference to me . because you're rich .
l'll be seeing you , erik . l'll be seeing you , pierre .
