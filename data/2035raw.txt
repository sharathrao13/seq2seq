santiago .

remain where you are .
remain where you are .
santiago .

this is the united states border patrol .
los angeles , ten years later
santiago .
stop goofing off .
load up the truck .
right now .
he's so hot .
santiago , where have you been?
we're already one down .
only one?
how's the diet going?
what are you doing?
i don't want anybody hurt .
no shin pads , no game .
get off .
see you .
hey .
how did you do?
you play well?
well , we won 4 2 .
scored a couple .
should have got another one .
in spanish .
what's the deal with dad?
he wants to buy a truck of his own .
why?
so you can work for yourselves .
munez and son , eh?
that's what he wants for us?
there's always plan b.
which one is that?
the american dream .
we win the lottery .
what happened?
he wants too much .
too bad .
you have to eat something .
hey .
hey , boss .
i've been a busboy now for six months .
why can't i be a waiter?
this chinese restaurant .
you're not chinese .
so?
this is america .
you're american , i'm american .
you have green card?
if i had one , could i be a waiter?
no .
you're not chinese .
tommy .
hold your position .
tommy , you're supposed to be on the wing .
it's not the cup final .
he's seven years old .
you're never too young , val .
to be honest , i don't think tom's that into soccer .
that's b ...
oh .
go .
hey .
watch out .
go on , tom .
thanks .
he's quite a player .
yes , he is .
did you teach him to do that?
god taught him .
he doesn't look right .
his balance is all wrong .
doesn't look up enough .
doesn't lift his legs high enough .
that's what all the other teams think .
then that happens .
well played , son .
do you ever play professional?
well ... pro teams go for college kids and ... none of us went to college .
when's your next game?
saturday .
there's someone i bumped into on the plane on the way over here .
i want him to see you play .
he's a sports agent .
i'm serious .
i think you're worth it , son .
listen , no offence , but i need to get to work .
i used to play a bit myself .
yeah?
where?
england .
i was a scout too .
i know what i'm talking about .
england?
what's your name , son?
santiago munez .
glen foy .
i'll see you saturday , santiago .
man .
movie stars have agents .
what's an agent supposed to do with you?
do you know something?
your boy's really good .
he could be a star .
don't you get it?
there are two types of people in this world .
those that live in big houses and people like us , who cut their lawns and wash their cars .
that could change if i become a professional player .
what are you saying?
you play in a park with a bunch of guys who work in a car wash .
i don't know .
meet this guy and everything could change .
for the better .
i know how to make things better .
we buy a truck .
we make our own business .
the rest is rubbish .
another beer .
baseball , tennis , soccer , basketball .
all at the touch of a button .
experience the thrill of the game from the comfort of your home environment .
barry , is this a good moment?
no time like the present .
so he's a young mexican kid from the barrio .
he dazzled me , i tell you , barry .
as you know , i don't dazzle easily .
the last time was a young kid called jermain defoe .
i'd rather not talk about that , glen .
so he's playing on saturday afternoon .
some college downtown .
right , tell me exactly where it is and i'll be there 110 % .
glad to hear it .
oh , hello , now .
why don't you knock yourself out and help yourself to finger food?

i'm in la .
whoo .

this is my little brother .
hello , how are you?
pleased to meet you .
and this is my grandma .
this is my daughter val .
hi .
so you are the agent?
no , no , no , no .
this man arranged for the agent to come .
and he didn't , i'm afraid .
he's ... you know , he's too busy .
so he'll come to the next game?
no , no , i'm afraid he can't .
he's flying back to england tomorrow .
so am i.
look at that .
maybe the old man is right .
you dare to dream , get screwed .
thanks anyway .
hello .
who is this?
this is glen foy .
glen foy?
do i know you , mr foy?
uh ...
well , i was one of your scouts when you first took over .
you fired me , actually .
well , you brought in the new regime .
i don't hold it against you .
oh , you don't?
so why are you calling me at half past three in the morning?
sorry .
i'm in california .
i've just seen a young player .
i think he's a remarkable talent .
who does he play for?
oh , just local league .
kickabout stuff .
the point is , i'm on a plane home tomorrow and i want you to make me a promise .
if he turns up on your doorstep , will you see him?
you want me to promise you this , right?
aye .
just give him a run out .
that's all i'm asking .
if i say yes , can i go back to sleep?
yes , mr dornhelm .
then yes , mr foy .
santiago .
hey .
how are you doing?
fine , thank you .
why are you here?
your coach told me where to find you .
who's this?
the man from england who watched me play football .
if you get yourself to england , newcastle united will give you a trial .
newcastle united?
that's a big club .
a very big club .
what is this bullshit?
you think you are going to play football in england?
he thinks i'm good enough .
why you fill him with ideas like this?
who the hell do you think you are?
and you .
why don't you keep your feet on the ground instead of your head in the sky?
it's a big thing you ask , senor .
he's supposed to fly halfway across the world on something you say?
the manager's made me a promise .
he'll give him a trial .
the rest is up to him .
look in my eyes and answer me this .
grandma .
can santi make it as a professional?
aye , i believe he can .
dad .
we've gotta go .
if the freeway's busy , you're gonna miss your flight .
here's my card .
it's all my numbers .
think about it .
give me a ring .
it's good to meet you .
good to see you .
you got enough?
enough what?
everyone knows the money's in the boot .
so are you going?
grandma thinks i should .
what does dad think?
i haven't asked him .
how far away is england?
right now?
400 bucks too far .
go back to sleep .
now .
there?
thanks .
how could you do this , dad?
i paid 4500 for the truck .
i took 1200 of yours , but i'm giving you half the business .
that's a good deal .
you stole that money .
stay out of this , mother .
you knew what it was for .
two more weeks and i have enough .
for what?
to chase a stupid dream?
big time ballplayer in england .
come on .
it's bullshit .
and when you fail , how are you gonna come back with no papers?
one chance , and you think i should just give it up for what you do?
what i do is take care of my family .
in mexico , i work construction .
at night , i clean up in a brothel .
but i save enough to bring us to america .
and when your mother walk out on us ...
no .
when she walk out ,
i hold this family together .
leave her out of this .
i make enough for this house and now we have our own business .
that's how things get better .
that's how you measure a man's life .
it's your life .
not mine .
gavin .
gavin .
gavin .
ladies and gentlemen , this is a very good day for the club .
gavin is a very gifted player and should fit in very well with our set up here at st james 'park .
i'm very pleased to present him ... with this .
winning the league's out of sight , erik .
what are your realistic goals for the rest of the season?
finishing in the first four and qualifying for europe .
it's essential for a club like this .
to do that , you're gonna have to take maximum points from your next games .
look , the club has had some problems lately , yeah .
but ...
i'm here now , yeah .
and i'm not in it for fame or money or anything like that .
i like to win matches .
so maximum points shouldn't be a problem .
eh , boss?
where's your father?
he's gone to get a part for the truck .
good .
he doesn't have to hear this .
train ticket to san diego .
bus ticket to mexico city .
mexico city?
yes .
you can't fly to london from los angeles .
you're illegal .
this is your ticket .
it's dated one week from now .
grandma , how did you pay for this?
i've worked all my life .
i have savings .
what did you sell?
what did you hock?
old things , from the past .
so now do i get a room to myself?
come here .
who's gonna help with your homework?
you won't do it .
he'll do it .
take a shower before you leave .
you smell real bad .
am i leaving tonight?
sure .
before your father gets home .
when your mother walked out on us ,
i promised god i'd do everything to help you boys follow your dreams .
you deserve this chance , santiago .
take it .
passengers making connecting flights from mexico should proceed to gate 14 .
purpose of your visit?
excuse me?
business or pleasure?
business .
i play ...
i play soccer ... football .
i hope to .

oh , no .

just caught me a bit off guard , that's all .
well , you'd best stay with me till you get settled .
ok .
welcome to the toon .
what is that?
it's where the geordies live .
what is a geordie?
someone that lives in the toon .
you've a lot to learn , bonny lad .
you mean toons , like looney tunes and stuff?
like bugs bunny?
thank you .
you live here alone?
aye .
well , my daughter you met .
do you have a wife?
she died a couple of years ago cancer .
i'm sorry .
my grandma ...
she sent you this .
oh , it's ...
she has it since she's a little girl .
i'm not much of a catholic , mind .
she thinks you're a good man , so ...
santiago , your dinner's ready .
santiago .
i thought you worked in football .
not any more .
i was finished a while back , like some of these cars .
you fix 'em?
aye , i fix them , restore them .
listen , there'll not be anyone at the club till ten o'clock .
so why don't you get yourself something to eat?
some breakfast or something?
yeah .
do you have any money?
no .
but i'm ok .
no , i can't .
it's ok .
take it .
turn right .
just for now .
here , mate , watch the ball .
oh , no .
hey , mister , can we have wor ball back?
quite tasty .
aye , if you work in a circus .
i'm done .
sorry .
here .
nice one .
i hear some players have a problem with gavin harris .
divvent like his attitude .
aye .
well , three clubs in five years should tell you something .
i think he's better playing on the inside .
if he's in a mood , he gets lost out wide .
aye , right enough , like .
what are you looking at?
sorry , but you're talking about soccer , right?
no .
football?
oh , aye .
yeah .
that's all there is to talk about .
where are you from , son?
los angeles .
oh , aye?
you know charlize theron?
she's a cracker , like .
what are you doing up here?
i have a tryout for newcastle united .
a trial , like?
howay .
are you serious , lad?
yeah , yeah .
maybe today , actually .
you wanna lay off the black pudding , son .
what is it exactly?
you don't want to know .
football's a religion here .
london has any number of teams , same in the midlands .
manchester , you've got two , liverpool , you've got two , glasgow's got two .
up here , though , it's just the toon .
there she is .
is that the manager?
erik dornhelm .
mr dornhelm .
he can be intimidating .
look him in the eye .
i don't think my look will make a difference .
it'll be my feet .
mr dornhelm , excuse me .
glen foy .
this is the young man i was telling you about .
hi .
he's from los angeles .
santiago munez .
when was this?
when i phoned you in the middle of the night .
you promised to give him a trial .
yes .
one minute , please .
like that?
score a hat trick , you can have it .
i'm sure you have a watch and i'm absolutely sure it's an expensive one .
what time does it say?
sorry , boss .
i was dropping a shirt off for a sick kid in hospital .
the pr people should have had a camera .
would have been a really good photo op .
that , i think , is bullshit .
there are six journalists inside , waiting for 15 minutes .
get in there .
and today , you train with the reserves .
oh , f ...
where do you play?
los angeles .
i meant position .
yeah .
for my team , i play up front , but i prefer midfield .
that way , i see more of the ball .
get him over to the training ground .
let's see what he's got .
will do .
thank you very much .
hey , i'll be around .
oh , you're there .
how are you feeling , son?
ok .
good .
mal braithwaite .
club coach .
i've been a friend of glen's since he played here , so i'm on your side .
all right?
yeah .
thank you , sir .
i'm not a sir .
i'm a coach .
sir is the gaffer .
that's who's gonna be watching you today , all right?
fit?
yeah .
good .
let's go .
come on .
it'll be fine .
yeah .
come on .
get up the field .
behind you .
keep moving it .
put it square .
son .
i want you midfield , on the right .
ok?
gavin ...
you know who gavin is?
no .
slot in behind him there .
ok .
that's the fella .
ok?
get adie off .
adie .
come off .
ok , pal .
swap bibs with him .
do your best .
hey , mal .

face up .
how many?
adios , amigo .
santiago .
get yourself a shower .
i don't know , glen .
my legs wouldn't do what my brain was telling them .
i'll be better tomorrow .
i promise .
there's not gonna be a tomorrow , santiago .
get in the car .
you know , my father believes people have a place in life .
you work , you feed your family .
you die .
and it's foolish to think otherwise .
excuse me , sir ...
i had a word with the fellow on the door .
he said i could come in and just look for someone .
i won't be a second .
mr dornhelm .
glen foy from this morning .
listen , i'm sorry to interrupt the proceedings .
have i missed all the boring speeches?
i'm making one of the " boring " speeches .
this distraction is not welcome .
well , if you'd answered my calls , i wouldn't be here .
what do you want?
listen , this kid , santiago munez .
would you like to sit here?
sure .
thanks .
listen , he's grown up in poverty and hardship and his only way out is his skill with the ball .
he's flown 6, 000 miles on my say so .
he's jet lagged .
he's nervous .
you know , he's never seen mud before and you put him on a pitch like that .
and then you spend the whole time on your mobile .
i saw him flat on his ass most of the time .
yet there was one moment of magic .
when he took the ball on the bounce .
turned magowan .
took it down .
i saw it .
looks good .
hear they do you well here .
listen , when i was a scout ,
i used to spend the whole time , on muddy days , watching young lads clogging the shite out of each other , and just once in a while , there'd be one that'd come along and lift your heart .
like this lad .
just give him a month .
ah , so you found all my yesterdays?
i was just looking .
my wife made this scrapbook .
you never told me you were a major league player .
aye .
well , not for as long as i'd have liked .
why?
got an injury .
did my knee in .
look at that .
shorts were shorter , hair was longer .
didn't make l8 million a year , either .
but you were still heroes .
oh , aye .
footballers have always been heroes , even in my father's day , earning l8 a week and working down the mine at the same time .
there you go .
no , i can't accept it .
it's too special .
i'm not giving it to you .
just try it on .
i want to see what you look like in the black and white .
what's the point?
what's the point?
well , you've got a month's trial .
better phone your granny again .
right , listen up , you lot .
this is santiago munez .
he's from mexico .
no .
los angeles .
los angeles .
whatever .
before this day's done , i want you to let him know who you are .
ok .
right , let's get to it .
push it hard .
hard .
nice one , franny .
nice work .
come on .
15 .
16 .
17 .
come on , santiago .
santi , i've been to mexico once .
did you like it?
gave me the shits for a week .
one day , son .
but not today .
come on , move .
thank you .
do you want to sit down , please?
ok .
it may be a little high .
why's that?
well , 'cause you are so close and you smell nice .
it's normal .
are you the club doctor?
no , i'm his nurse .
he'll examine you soon .
did you fill in the paperwork?
yeah .
just a couple of words i didn't understand .
ok .
like what?
like this one here .
that's " cardiovascular " .
it means " heart problems " .
oh .
no .
no .
and how about that one?
respiratory " do you have any problems with your lungs or breathing?
do you?
no .
do you wanna step on the scales?
right .
what's your name?
nurse harmison .
i mean your first name .
you don't need to know that .
you don't need to know where i live , what my star sign is , or what i'm doing on saturday night .
i'm gonna have to take blood .
oh , man .
really?
i don't like needles .
but you have a tattoo , or is that a rub on transfer?
that was a gang thing .
you were in a gang?
not any more .
there's only three ways to get out of a gang you get shot , you go to jail , or ...
in my case , you have a grandmother who kicks some sense into you .
sorry , tough guy .
what's your problem?
problem?
what problem?
come on .
ignore him .
he's a tit .
walk away .
he's a knobhead .
laughing at you , mate .
he's a knobhead , mate .
hey , forget him .
knobhead?
knobhead?
come on .
let's get a game going .
how long did they give you?
a month .
a month?
that's not long .
at least i got six .
i was with tranmere rovers before this .
they signed me from school when i was 14 .
how's it going?
early days .
that's gavin harris .
they just signed him for l8 million .
dining with the bum bandit today , are we , jamie?
hughie magowan's 33 .
unless every other centre back in the squad breaks his leg ,
he'll not play for the first team again .
why be so pissed with me?
well , you're the new kid on the block , son .
you've got something he never had flair .
flair?
aye .
you know , most players , myself included , they play within themselves .
they play to their strengths so they don't expose their weaknesses .
the great players , the ones with flair , they take risks , because they don't believe they're risks .
put your coat down here .
three and in .
you're in .
all righty .
they control the ball , the ball doesn't control them .
here .
look at this .
two jackets and a ball .
it's all you need .
finished with that , son?
yeah .
sorry .
sorry .
santi .
there you go .
hey , listen .
i could show you the town if you like .
tonight .
go clubbing .
bevvy .
women .
yeah .
uh ...
do i need an id or something?
id?
yeah .
identification?
yeah .
how old do you have to be here to get a drink?
eleven .
all right , gavin .
listen , mate , if you want an autograph , write to the club , you muppet .
listen , elvis , i'm with the club too .
mate , i'm with the club too , you know .
i've never seen you before .
i don't go out much .
hey .
hey .
nurse harmison .
nurse harmison .
hi .
you wanna come into this club with us?
no way .
it's full of posers , that place .
yeah?
where are you going?
we're going to the spyglass .
what do you say?
yeah , yeah .
here we go , here we go .
canny wine , this rioja .
it's from your part of the world , isn't it?
spain .
no , i'm from la .
i'm from merseyside .
la?
and merseyside?
what are you two doing up here?
well ...
we play for newcastle .
i thought you said players were off limits .
relax .
they haven't made the reserves yet .
well , as long as you're mired in mediocrity , pet , you're in with a chance .
i'm sorry , but i don't know what that means .
it means don't change .
don't become something you're not .
well , my life's already changed , just by being here .
i grew up on a council estate with a dad on the dole and a mum on the booze .
change is fine with me .
i remember you now .
you're the one with the toe .
what?
you had fungus behind your big toenail .
what?
did you have to mention that?
oh , man .
i guess in your job , you must see the whole team naked?
i know what you're gonna say .
i'm not gonna ask who has the biggest .
ok , what were you gonna ask?
who has the smallest?
it must be you , because she cannot tell us .
go on .
come on .
mark him , mark him .
space , hit space .
stick with him .
remember what i told you .
here .
here .
ok , pass .
pass the ball .
pass it .
why didn't you pass the ball , man?
hey , mal .
munez .
come here .
hey , lads .
over here .
come on .
gather round .
hey , mal .
give me five minutes .
ok , boss .
thank you .
so when i say go , i want you to run as fast as you can to the goal .
ok?
yeah .
go .
come back .
again .
go .
what did you learn?
that you can score from halfway .
no .
that the ball can travel faster than you .
here , we pass the ball .
you understand that?
we're a unit , not a one man show .
the name on the front of the shirt is more important than the one on the back .
ok?
yeah .
santi .
hey .
this is the final countdown for newcastle utd .
only three games left this season , and to qualify for europe in the champions league , and all the riches that go with that , they'll have to win them all starting today .
oh , man .
never an easy team to beat , chelsea .
well coached , well drilled .
they certainly are .
the game , yeah .
i'm with gavin's girlfriend .
i'll call you back .
lads .
toon , toon .
black and white army .
toon , toon .
black and white army .
toon , toon .
black and white army .
how's that possible?
for all their possession , you have to say
newcastle haven't yet created one clear cut chance .
he's fading .
aye .
by a brilliant sense of positional play , he's avoided contact with the ball .
well , maybe he's playing hurt .
no , he's hungover .
right , get him off .
shola .
now , this looks quite bad for newcastle .
the last thing they need is another injury .
they've already got several walking wounded out there .
number ten off , mate .
free kicks and get far post at corners .
wait a second .
it's gavin harris who's coming off .
what?
me?
he's taking gavin off .
what the hell is he thinking about?
what are you thinking about , you german twat?
substitution for newcastle united .
what are you doing?
sit down .
only five minutes left to play .
still no score .
chelsea still have the upper hand .
goal .
they've got one at last .
