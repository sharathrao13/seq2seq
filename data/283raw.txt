kind of exciting .
i'm a little nervous .
i'm sure you'll do fine .
no , i know i will .
that's got a kick to it .
this is my first chance to work with special agent rachel wright .
rachel .
you're still hung up on her?
edna , i'm not hung up on her .
i find her interesting , and i admire her work .
there's a certain allure she has .
you know , a blind man could see that .
well , why don't you tell her?
i will tell her .
it's just , i get nervous , and i end up sounding like an idiot
want me to tell you how to melt rachel's heart?
yeah .
talk to carlos .
what does that mean?
they had a thing?
two week stakeout .
she could barely walk .
rachel and carlos?
you called , edna?
you are a vision , as always .
hello , alex .
hello , carlos .
how was cuba?
adequate .
oh , adequate , my eye .
he single handedly averted another bay of pigs .
no , i didn't  yes .
you exaggerate .
oh , well , i ....
you do exaggerate sometimes .
okay , at times , yeah .
and you , alex?
how did you fare in the tundra?
you know , i did pretty good .
i got selected for a new mission , so obviously everybody was satisfied .
and the pilot?
the pilot ....
was able to talk to him , get some valuable information from him .
successful mission .
alex , you didn't go and get him killed , now , did you?
no , no , no .
i mean ....
you know , sort of .
i mean yeah , he's dead .
he's dead .
what are you gonna do?
let me tell you something , alex .
yeah .
you're an excellent agent .
don't let results like this fool you .
all right?
my car .
be back for my things later .
see you , carlos .
la vida loca !
what a phony .
i'd give anything to go on a two week stakeout with that man .
what happened on the stakeout between him and rachel?
i didn't hear anything .
it's not what i heard , it's what i saw .
it's what i saw .
i saw the look on her face .
every woman recognizes that look .
what's that look?
look of total satisfaction .
guy gets a couple missions in latin america , and he's a julio lglesias .
you know , he's from lowa , by the way .
you know , he's from lowa , by the way .
is this my stuff?
oh , easy .
this is carlos 'stuff .
this is yours .
where's my monofilament phone descender?
i didn't get one of these exploding pagers .
i don't see one of those .
you got the micro gps .
micro?
this is your spy cam .
this is carlos 'spy cam , and this is my spy cam?
look at the size of this thing !
size matters .
but in the spy world , it's reversed .
you want people to say , " look how small and sexy and sleek this is .
not , " how huge this is !
look what he pulled out of his pants .
it's huge !
people will laugh at me if i pull this out .
is that his escape module?
yes , it is .
i know , everybody wants to be like carlos .
i don't want to be like carlos , but i notice ... ... my stuff looks like you can get it from radioshack in 1972 .
yes , it is .
right away .
all right , we'll finish this later .
it's a good start , though .
kelly robinson , seen here making his typical flamboyant entrance
shouldn't this be on the weather channel or something? with a first round knockout of blake " the blade " lirette .
yeah !
57 and 0 , baby !
kelly robinson , baby !
that guy is so annoying .
everybody " hungary " for his showdown ... ... with the european heavyweight king , cedric mills .
you don't understand how important it is ... ... that i be 58 and 0 .
i'm 57 and 0 right now .
this man gonna be 58 !
that guy is a born jerk .
cheese .
cheese .
that's right , take my picture .
cheese .
cheese .
get my right side .
cheese .
alex !
gen. tucker , this is special agent alex scott .
general .
special agent .
i love hearing that .
i was a regular agent a couple weeks ago ... ... and then around christmas , i got promoted to special .
special .
we were going over the op .
we call it the " switchblade .
it was the first electrochromatic invisible stealth aircraft .
but in the hands of the evildoers ... ... it's an untraceable delivery system for weapons of mass destruction .
arnold gundars .
the boys over at cla have access to his overseas accounts .
the past five days , there's been a depletion of funds ... ... without reimbursements .
the bastard's bought the damn plane .
he just hasn't sold it yet .
i'll get it back , general .
give me a minute .
hot .
are you sure we can't use carlos?
no , they all know him .
without plastic surgery , he wouldn't last five minutes on this case .
that's a shame .
that carlos is amazing .
this guy ....
you sure about this , mac?
he'll get the job done .
shouldn't rachel be here?
she's already in budapest setting up .
you've worked with her before , right?
i have but not in a stakeout situation .
this mission doesn't call for a stakeout .
it wouldn't hurt to keep our options open .
the european middleweight championship ... ... is being held in budapest in two days .
gundars is a boxing fanatic .
he's throwing a party the night before .
okay .
classic stakeout scenario , right?
no , alex .
no stakeout .
this is more about hacking and tracking .
now , take a look at this guest list .
you got to be kidding .
this is like a who's who of international bad guys .
obviously , gundars is using this party as cover to auction the plane .
your mission is to get into his palace ... ... find out where the plane is and stop him from selling it .
with these heavy hitters in one place , security's gonna be insane .
exactly .
the way we see it , there's only one shot to get you in there .
stakeout?
no .
we've arranged cover .
you'll be working with a civilian to secure entry .
a civilian?
57 and 0 .
gonna be 58 and 0 .
you know how kelly robinson do .
listen to me now .
i don't care what gen. patton says .
we don't need to do it this way .
i think if
i kicked ass all around the world .
for crying out loud .
can we turn this off or change the channel?
he gives me a headache
watch what come out of your mouth , blond surfer boy .
he never shuts up .
he's lighting into some reporter .
no , i'm talking to you .
watch what come out of your mouth .
you digging your grave with your tongue .
you'll get your ass whipped .

t. j. , what'd i tell you?
the secret mission?
secret mission .
secret mission .
yeah , yeah , the mission man .

right .
it's not a good idea to tell them who i am .
we should keep that down .
i ain't no fool .
i ain't tell them who you was .
i said i had to take care of the president's retarded nephew .
what?
yeah , they think you're a retard .
all you do is get some drool , a helmet and zip your jacket up .
you get that mentally challenged look .
hold on just a second .
that's good .
can i talk to you for a second?
yeah , go ahead .
what's up?
excuse us .
uncomfortable .
too many brothers standing around .
we're getting off on the wrong foot .
you think you're the harlem globetrotters ... ... and i'm the team that looks like an idiot .
yeah , that's it .
but that's not how it's gonna work .
we're on the same team .
i'm meadowlark lemon .
you're curly neal .

meadowlark , you get me some of this chicken ... ... some sodas , jelly beans and get these bags and get on the plane .
meadowlark .

he told me that in this situation , he would be meadowlark and i'm curly .
what kind of bullshit is that?
curly , my ass .
i'm meadowlark .
i'm not kelly robinson .
no , you ain't .
he don't make his own phone calls .
he don't call his mama !
come on .
i'm just trying to confirm the man's reservation .

he's a funny guy .
i gotta remember that one .
when you did the stick up , i went flying there !
that's a good trick .
i'm glad you got that out of your system .
i'm gonna need you at the party at 8 .

we got to change the schedule .
kelly robinson don't go to parties at 8 : 00 .
i ain't about to start .
are you gonna refer to yourself in the third person?
that can get irritating .
it won't get irritating until 11 : 00 ... ... because that's when i'm showing up for your little party .
okay .
excuse me , gents .
i can't risk that .
the party could clear out by 11 : 00 .
ain't no party that kelly robinson at gonna end at 11 : 00 .
that attitude can destroy a mission .

a lame ass party that end at 11 : 00 .
let that shit go , man .
drop the shit .
okay .
i'll get t. j. or jerry to get me in .

it's one of the things we've got for the mission .
it's cool .
it opens up .
i put this little camera in my eye ... ... and i give this to t. j. then he can see everything i see .
wait .
i don't want t. j. 's eye juices on something that goes in my eye .
maybe i should try it .
what you call it?
polyalloy transducers .
the polyalloy should be for me .
let me put it in my eye , then .

it's a big thrill for you , huh?
you don't know .
i know you from the advertisement for your perfume .
kelly robinson .
tko .
tko .
that's right .
it's not perfume .
it's cologne .
perfume is for ladies and sissies .
i put out cologne .
i so stupid .
so , kelly , tell me ... ... do you really wear it?
well , you tell me .
i'd love to go to your room and get your autograph .

wrong .
excuse me .
no .
come here for a second .
excuse me .
what's wrong with you?
what are you doing?
nothing .
but if you let go of my arm ... ... i'm gonna go across and wax that ass .
you are a spy right now .
i can't have you running off ... ... with a strange hungarian woman .
i'm kelly robinson .
going off with a strange woman is what i do .
mind your own business .
have a good evening , all right?
i'm just jealous .
i know , but she chose kelly .
i'll hit it once for you , all right?
see if she's got a sister .
if so , it'll be the three of us .
why don't you go see the city?
what you say your name was?
are you going to scream it?
i will scream your name if i know it .
i had a couple of interesting situations where ....
what happened?
the girl tried to press charges
hey , slow it down !
i got a lady over here .
hey , that's some serious road rage .
what's up , man?
what's all this?
how long have you been working for the u. s. government?
i work for kelly robinson .
there was bns agent on your jet .
i don't know .
who was he?
you've been reading spy novels .
maybe we should cut off his penis .
cut off my penis?
what happened to " rough the man up "?
cut it off !
wait a second !
you ain't cutting off nobody's penis !
i'll answer all your questions , but
who's the agent?
i'm not sure if he's an agent .
who's the agent?
i don't know if he's an agent or not !
he's 5 foot 9 .
blond hair  his name?
i'm not sure , but he's very annoying .
he's definitely a bns agent .
his name?
y'all got these knives and guns pointing at me , so i'm blocking !
he got one of them white names .
alan or ....
take off his pants .
why you gonna take my pants off?
please don't cut off kelly robinson's penis .
freeze !
kelly !
kelly , shoot her !
shoot her !
did i kill her?
not yet .
stop shooting that .
what the hell's going?
i'm sorry , i'm being rude .
special agent rachel wright .
nice to officially meet you .
you're a spy !
don't tell anyone .
you're all bns?
it's all bns .
big fan , mr. robinson !
crazy way of showing it .
god , alex , you been working out?
yeah , a little .
why?
you just got buff .
just doing curls .
two , three drops of me come out of this .
alex wanted to test you before we put you in the game .
so this whole thing was a big test?
unbelievable .
that was great .
really?
really .
oh , cool .
guys , excuse us for a second .
yeah .
hey , good job .
nice work , nice work .
good .
i have seen hundreds of agents ... ... put through that exercise , and i've never seen it handled so well .
never .
never .
yeah .
well , kelly robinson .
it was like your instincts were perfect .
give them unimportant information .
like he's blond , 5'9 " .
how many guys fit that description?
that doesn't mean anything .
you'd never name names .
you know what you are?
you're a " why not " guy , not a " why " guy .
what's the difference?
why are we gonna do this?
they're afraid to make a decision .
afraid they might get in trouble .
as opposed to a " why not " guy .
he's like , " roll the dice .
that's me .
kelly robinson .
the " why not " guys are like eagles .
they don't flock .
the few , the proud , the " why not .
the president wouldn't have called me if i wasn't a " why not " guy .
let me see everything .
now , kelly , we gotta get you up to speed .
you're about to hear a national secret .
this is arnold gundars , premier arms dealer .
he has this plane ... ... the switchblade .
it's a sophisticated prototype stolen from the u. s. government .
this is the next generation of stealth technology .
undetectable to radar , infrared , even the human eye .
our mission is to get it back .
to make a long story short ... ... we can't find it , because we can't see it .
here it is with the electrochromatic cloaking device engaged .
like one of those bugs that look like a leaf .
one of the who?
there's this bug that ... ... stays safe because it looks like a leaf .
but it's not really a leaf .
it can make itself look like one .
a leafy bug .
it's a good name for it .
you should call that the " leafy bug " .
that's a good idea .
i'll pass that on .
the leafy bug .
we gotta go .
we'll be late for the mission .
it's almost 8 : 00 .
you owe me one belt .
yamaguchi .
hey , you got a cell phone?
tuxedo .
i'm gonna set that all up .
hey , alex , i'm sorry i kneed you and roughed you up in there .
you okay?
my gosh , don't be ridiculous .
i thought that was great .
when you kneed me , i loved that .
you did?
you loved that?
i just felt it helped sell it .
made it convincing .
wait to turn this on .
the satellite's only good for the next 72 hours .
let's hope that's more than we need .
all right , set us up .
you know the drill .
hey , what's in that bag?
spy stuff .
always have a sure way out .
hey , rachel .
what's up?
it's weird .
it feels like a stakeout , doesn't it?
no .
not really .
and we are live .
hey , what's that for?
this is how i'm gonna break this case wide open with your help .
it's a replica of the pen gundars carries .
there's an ihb tracking device built in .
technology .
if alex can plant it on him , we can follow his movements .
okay .
let's do this , then .
nice shifting , rachel .
these stick shifts can be a little tricky .
you make it look easy .
thank you .
please tell me you didn't say , " nice shifting .
don't worry about it .
you really like that girl , huh?
rachel?
no .
yes , you do .
mr. robinson !
hey .
welcome !
hey .
i am very big fan .
how you doing?
you a fan too?
it's going around , baby .
how you doing?
kelly robinson , 57 and 0 .
you got that?
no , no , no , i'm with him .
kelly !
tell these guys i'm with you .
i'm with the boxer .
i've never seen that man before .

that's the whole point , isn't it?
that you can't see it .
that's what you're buying , isn't it?
that's true .
thank you .
wait a second .
come on .
is that ...?
please .
finally !
well .
now you'll believe me when i tell you ... ... that you've driven past it half a dozen times .
it is the most incredible thing i have ever seen .
shall we conclude our business?
gentlemen , to the center of the ring .
i explained the instructions in the dressing room .
you're both professional fighters .
i expect you to conduct yourself professionally .
shake hands .
you ready to do this?
let's do it .
it looks like my computer is a billion dollars healthier .
which makes you the proud owner ... ... of the most advanced piece of weaponry on the planet .
watch this .
the ignition code .
round one for the super middleweight ...
... championship of the world !
cedric , come on .
do you want the swelling on the left or right?
mills goes right to work .
left hand up !
left hand up !
he's spun around by
what are you doing?
i'm working .
that looks like an old fashioned thermonuclear warhead .
it's a bit primitive , isn't it?
they won't think so in washington .
tell your men to drop their guns .
tell them !
do as he says .
get your hands up !
you too , mr. zhu tam .
do it !
you didn't think you could fool bns , did you?
rachel?
i guess we did .
you're alive?
don't tell anyone .
robinson having his way .
combination to the head .
and a left hook jars the challenger .
here comes robinson , and here comes mills .
body shots by the challenger , mills .
holding on to him .
tying the champion up .
that was pretty convincing .
the whole " i'm dead " thing .
you pick up a few tricks over the years .
you certainly do .
you really should have caught it .
yeah , i should have .
i guess i was a little distracted by the sound of my heart breaking .
code invalid .
that's not good .
is that good?
what the hell did you do?
i entered the ignition code .
self destruct sequence activated .
it has a self destruct mechanism if the wrong code is entered .
no , that is the correct code .
i saw lt. percy fire the engine myself .
just get it handled , agent wright .
that's what you're paid to do .
he ain't done nothing to earn your respect !
it's number 58 going down right now .
you hear?
how you feeling?
58 .
you good?
good , yeah .
damn !
she may wanna braid that .
and this world championship fight rages on .
the code times out?
what , like a safety precaution?
ln case the plane were stolen?
you're flying the plane home .
i assume you know the correct code .
assumptions have a way of coming back and kicking you in your ass .
robinson measuring mills up .
a wicked left hook by robinson .
how much is he paying you?
i don't have time for this .
if i'd known you were for sale , i would have bid !
i know that hurt .
you got a hard ass head .
damn !

robinson dancing around .

it looks like he's fighting an invisible opponent .
and down goes robinson !
unbelievable !
rachel , you're not getting this plane off the bridge .

kelly robinson is down for the first time in his career !
can you continue?
i'm okay .

kelly robinson is still ... ... the super middleweight champion of the world !
robinson foregoing his usual flamboyant victory lap .
he bolts the ring .
i'm impressed , alex .
you're tougher than i thought .
there's one thing that will always make a man talk .
cutting my belt?
take off his pants .
take off my pants?
hold it .
wait a second .

easy .
come on , take it easy .
what are you doing here?
you turned on the eye thing ...

it's carlos .
i guess mac sent him in as backup for us .
he's like a superspy .
he's a spy , the same as me .
not a superspy .
he got a fly ass ninja outfit and parachute .
we hanging from balloons and shit .
gundars !
tell your men to put down their weapons .
it seems to be quite a trend tonight .
down !
alex , the code before we all blow up .
that's what i'm doing .
i was on my way to do it .
doing fine before you got here .
mr. zhu tam , i believe .
carlos , careful .
rachel's a double agent !
yes , i know , alex .
yours too , rachel .
apparently , you've been a bad girl .
now hold up .
wait a second .
hey , alex ...
... this james bond is with rachel .
not now .
i got a hunch .
this guy is bad .
i can feel it right now .
i said , not now .
let me figure this out !
how did big shot know she was bad?
i got 45 seconds to figure out this logarithmic code ... ... or we'll all die because we'll blow up .
why don't you stick to your perfume ads and leave the espionage to me?
no , don't say that to him .
hey , zorro , it's not perfume .

but i'm on your side .
i'm with bns .
what do bns stand for?
bitch that need slapping?
i tried to make sure carlos doesn't get to this computer .
think i believe that?
what's wrong with you?
hear her trying to flip the script?
she's saying she's good?
i gotta hear this .
this should be rich .
we've suspected carlos was dirty for months .
mac and me teamed up with him so we could nail him .
why didn't they tell me?
you know how this works .
it's all on a need to know basis .
you know that .
mac didn't want you protecting me at the wrong time .
that's all carlos would have needed .
he's jealous of us .
he is?
if he knew how we felt
go easy now .
don't be creeping up and shit .
she got long legs .
bitch is sneaky .
she'll kick you .
he's always known i wanted to work with you .
you wanted to work with me?
yeah .
what , like on a stakeout?
don't you know how i feel about you?
that's bullshit .
my head's spinning .
i don't know
can't deny it .
i feel the same  you dizzy from massive blood loss ... ... because the bitch stabbed you 15 minutes ago !
i could have crippled him for life if i wanted to .
you've got full mobility in your leg?
it doesn't feel that bad .
son of a gun .
i had no idea .
carlos was jealous of us?
enough .
i can't listen to this shit .
what's wrong with you?
you booty blinded right now .
it's like being snow blinded with no snow , just a cute piece of ass .
no .
she's telling the truth .
you don't understand the spy world .
there are agents .
there are double agents , and there are pseudo double agents .
it's actually pretty standard stuff .
y'all stabbing each other is standard?
yeah .
it's pretty standard .
look out !
i'm watching your ass .
alex , you idiot !
i'm on your side !
i've had enough of this !
there's vitalis and shit all over
he was coming like a buzz saw .
if you didn't grab him , he was gonna kill me .
it was like looking in the eyes of the devil .
where's rachel?
yeah , where is rachel , huh?
she gone .
didn't i tell you that bitch was bad?
why didn't you keep an eye on her?
you said she was good !
you can't listen to what i say .
i'm bleeding from a knife wound .
i'm delusional !
you said yourself i'm booty blind .
i'm blinded by ass .
you blinded now , but a minute ago
you two fools just let rachel escape with gundars 'computer?
that has all the passwords to his numbered accounts .
it's worth billions of dollars !
mac knew you would screw this up .
that's why he sent me
worth billions of dollars .
you hear this guy?
he's still a bad guy , right?
yeah , he well , i don't know .
everybody keeps flip flopping around .
i can't keep it straight .
it's murky .
you said it was standard  i know what i said !
it's murky when there ain't no girl involved , huh?
i see how it go .
i'll tell you one thing .
good or bad , i'm tying this guy up .
we tie everybody up .
that's the new rule .
why don't you stop stressing?
there's the leafy bug , baby .
that's what we set out to do , and we got it !
we got the plane .
we heroes .
you're right .
let's go home .
look at that .
you wanna see something cool?

you broke it .
i broke the shit?
how i break it?
like a child , you knock it out of my hand .
i broke it?
you happy now?
how will i explain this?
i show up with the plane and a broken remote .
you think they're worried about the remote?
there's dead bodies all over the roof .
you think they'll care about that?
come on , man !
you're right .
let's go .
we're heroes .
i'm gonna get my parade , huh?
maybe so .
i'll definitely get a parade behind this .

and that is why they call it the switchblade .
all right .
ready for the ride of your life?
yeah , let's do this .
watch this .
punch it !
got a little wrinkle .
not to worry .
kelly robinson ain't supposed to go out like this !
i'm supposed to die in the ring !
kelly , you okay?
come here .
you okay?
hell , no !
i ain't okay .
you just crashed my parade down into the river .
we had nozzle failure .
then the thrust manifold went all haywire .
you didn't check it , did you?
huh?
this is perfect !
my first mission , i do everything right .
now thanks to you , i ain't a hero !
what is that?
this is my flotation device .
that's a bomb !
what?
that's a thermonuclear bomb .
why you gotta throw them around here , then?
no , it's okay .
it's not armed .
can you imagine if this had gone off?
this would have killed millions !
and they didn't arm it?
they didn't get a chance to .
you know why they didn't get a chance to?
because we stopped them !
we stopped them .
know what that means?
i think so .
we heroes again !
damn , you're right .
bet your pink ass i'm right !
we're heroes again !
even without the plane .
we're heroes !
this is the proof right here !
this bomb .
i can't wait to call the president .
we gonna get the congressional medal of honor and a parade !
this will be fantastic .
has my bank transfer come through?
not yet , ms. tessio .
where you going?
you forgot your drink .
alex , how are you?

alex?
how about a stakeout in greece for two weeks?
stakeout?
yeah .

i don't blame you .
it's just , i was looking forward to testing out the hover gel with you .
the whatsit gel?
hover .
it's a gelatinous hydrogen diphyoxide .
it's 12 times lighter than air .
you smear it all over your body ... ... and if you're in an oxygen rich environment ... ... it allows you to float down to earth like a bird .
like a jelly bird?
yeah .
that's the street name for it .
jelly bird . " exactly .
they have a couple on the transport plane .
plan was , they drop us off over d. c. , and we float down like birds .
there's press and photographers .
it's gonna be a whole spectacle , but ....
what we waiting on?
let's do this .
you'll do it?
