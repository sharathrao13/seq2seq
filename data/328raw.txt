you need me to change small bills to large ones and deliver to a third party .
i bet he'd like his money in a timely fashion .
delivery's late , it's your ass , not mine .
here's 50, 000 in 1 00s for your 50, 000 in 1 0s .
third party takes his million in these five briefcases here .
i hope i'm not losing you , chief .
i hate math .
so for your $3 million that we shrunk for you ... ... you get 2 million in clean money back .
less our percentage : $300, 000 .
i'll be delivering these to your dealer .
alexei .

i'd have let you know this job is rugged , you know .

we didn't sink it .
whoosah .
all right , the positive .
thank god no cops died .
i got a police commissioner so far up my ass ... ... if he spits it's coming out of my mouth .
but i know that there's always two sides to a story .
so , what's yours?
well , i was at a family barbecue .
we got a tip that the zoepounders ... ... were gonna do a hit on cash or drugs from this big time x man .
that's what they call a ecstasy dealer on the streets .
marcus , i know what they call them .
that's why i'm captain .
it's cool .
so you got the drugs .
no drugs .
oh , okay .
all right .
how about the money?
no money .
nope .
then who is this x man?
captain , i was at a family barbecue .

we didn't do all of that .
if you look close ...

it was the dashboard .
you know what?

yeah , you'll get your money .
somebody's on they way with your money .
is it possible we could discuss potential reimbursement ...
we don't cover personal property .
that's why we drive police cars .
so where do we go from here?
zoepounders knew exactly when to hit the drop , where to hit the drop ... ... so we figure they know where the cash is .
we find the cash , we find the x man .
hey , i'm through playing games , all right?
i have three cops critical .
i got kids dying on my streets from souped up x.
i do not want these animals taking over my city .
do you understand?
so i want you guys to do whatever you do , whatever it takes , but do it now .
it's not good , boss .
oh , my god .
fucking ratones eating my fucking money .
carlos , this is a stupid fucking problem to have .
but it is a problem nonetheless .
rat fuckers .
rat fuckers .
boss , it ended up crazy .
this black chica working for the russians was a maniac lunatic .
she saved your money .
she wasted some haitians and got the load to the drop .
also , roberto saw these two crazy gangbanger homeys .
oh , shit .
yeah .
chasing and shooting .
old days , did i have this problem?
no .
just fly the drugs in and ship the money out .
now american security's so goddamned tight over the water ... ... and in the sky ... ... that the rats eat my money before i can get it to cuba .

besides , models are filthy creatures .
you look more like an angel .
what do you think , carlos?
of course .
roberto , what do you think?
it's fucking beautiful .
talk polite in front of my little bonbon ... ... or i'm gonna chop your balls off .
for real , i'm straight with all your spiritual enlightenment and that shit .
but i need to know if a crackhead rolls to me with a . 9 , you'll cook that fool .
no question about it .
shoot him in the leg .
come on with that leg shit .
everybody deserves a little dignity .
what about my dignity?
your crackhead will be missing a kneecap .
i'll be in a body bag .
so sad .
what's so sad?
your untreated control issues .
it's not your fault .
what in the hell is that supposed to mean?
your mama probably refused you her tit when you were a baby .
you grew up a malnourished high school softie .
got your gun , little tight t shirt ... ... and became a overcompensating tough guy .
that is the last time you will ever refer to my mother's titties .
i don't even want them up in your head .
you know , i said all that , mike , and all you heard was " titties .
man , you can't keep suppressing my spiritual growth , mike .
you need to suppress my mother's titties out of your psychoanalysis .

palm mortuary , owned by an offshore holding company ... ... which , after 1 7 layers of bullshit ... ... turns out to be registered to donna maria tapia ... ... mother of hector juan carlos tapia , who calls himself johnny .
johnny tapia .
shit .
every time the pd goes after him ... ... he sues for wrongful arrest .
and , oh , does he win .
last year he was awarded $9 million .
and got a dozen dumb ass officers like you fired .
well , he hasn't run across us yet .
we'd love to hear what's going on in that house .
use your computer brain and tap the phone .
well , that happens to be highly illegal without a judge .
we were thinking of something more along the lines of a training operation .
no , i can't do that .
get you tickets to the heat game .

hello?

you know where we live .

got our way in . illegally?
you got to put a word to it .
it's like , secret .
so y'all want to kill roaches? illegal .
we'll plant a couple gypsy wires ... ... find out what tapia's up to .
these are your basic household bugs .
dog , this is what we do .
what's the sprayers for?
the roaches .
roaches?
we got rats .

that's not an issue .
we can handle that .
we'll just have to slightly adjust our approach a little bit .
nope .
nope .
i don't mess with no rats .
hey .
stop it .
we're in .
get your head right .
mike , i'm a grown ass man .
get your grown ass self together and let's do this .
you got a beautiful house , sir .
well , start looking .
they're all over .
those ain't normal rats .
what he means is that they're obviously a special breed .
what kind of breed are they?
big motherfuckers .
disposing of the rats isn't a problem .
but we should ensure there's no breeding elsewhere in the house .
yeah , at zook ... ... we like to work from the outside in , you know .
so we gonna leave these ...
excuse me .
we'll leave these here and send in a special unit .
it'd be better to begin in the rest of the house .
you're not getting in the rest of the house .
we won't be able to guarantee our work .
the only thing that we can guarantee ... ... is that these rats will keep fucking .
giving off offspring until we find the colony .
rats don't got no stinking colony .
well , actually these are colonial rats .
what they do is they send out worker rats that are called ...
marsupials .
marsupials .
these drones , they're explorers of the rat world , you know .
they just looking for rat pussy .
you know .
are you fucking with me?
hold on .
you called us .
we can leave .
but what you should understand is that these rats will hump twice a day .
all right .
down there .
just kill them and bring me the bill .
that's that bullshit .
that's that bullshit right there .
you see these rats?
plant your wires .
you're not leaving me with them .
plant your wires .
gentlemen .
alexei , josef .
oh , i really like that word , johnny .
gentlemen .

so ... ... your partner is here .
would you like to talk now?
carlos , another box .
so you sign over ownership papers for all the florida clubs you own ... ... and i will control everything ... ... from point of origin to sale .
okay?
no middleman .
especially russian middleman .
with all due respect , mr. tapia ... ... in my country , i see such things all the time .
i'm sorry for your country .
that must be some cuban stupid tradition to put them in a tortilla bin .
now , listen to me , you russian punk .
i , me , johnny tapia , will sever your head off !
you kill me and you will have a shit storm .
should i screw your young wife ... ... or visit your son , the soccer player?
my daughter knows your son .
you're gonna regret this .
i hope that we can remain friends .
because at the end , what else do we have but friendship , trust ... ... honor .
without this , we are no more than beasts .
the kitchen monitor's out .
what the hell's going on out there?
shit .
i found something .
it's a guy's finger .

they tried to steal from me , and you let them into my mother's house .

nobody puts in danger my daughter , my mother ... ... or my money .
send him to the mortuary .
johnny .
