let him go .
what?
let him go .
get him outta here .
any other time , that punk would die , but i can't do that shit no more .
don't want to burn nobody , even when i know i should .
that ain't me now .
all i want is to get my $75, 000 and get out .
just do it !
tell me he's in a fuckin 'coffin .
what happened?
somethin 'that shouldn't have happened .
give me your piece , dave .
what?
give me the fuckin 'gun .
since when are you a tough guy?
get yourself killed .
i can take care of myself .
you think i'm some law school schmuck , i never saw a bad guy before?
you are gonna wave that thing at the wrong guy ... ... he's gonna take it from you and bury it up your ass , guaranteed .
now give me the gun .
come on .
i know you love me , kid , but you gotta lighten up .
listen ... ... i'm throwin 'a big party out at my summer house saturday .
i want you to come .
something i wanna talk to you about .
why can't you talk to me about it here?
i'll tell you saturday .
i need visual aids .
what's the matter with you , pushing this guy in the pool ... ... your fucking friends knocking down my rented tables?
what you doing out here by yourself?
sittin '.
you sure are weird , baby .
how come you never try to fuck me?
you got into a big beef for me , and you ain't never laid a glove on me .
you're dave's girl now .
he can't fuck me , all the coke he's doin '.
what are you two talking about?
fucking .
speaking of fucking , look at those fucking friends of yours .
they're a fucking embarrassment .
do something .
be a hostess .
fuck you , asshole !
yeah , fuck me .
your fuckin 'chick's giving you a hand job in front of everybody !
i got guests here , for christ's sake !
people are eating !
take it easy , dave !
you take it easy !
got any manners?
you wanna fuck her , fuck like a normal human being !
take her to the bedroom !
people !
okay , dave , what's up?
i need you to do something for me .
what is it?
you gotta help me spring tony taglialucci from the prison barge at rikers .
are you crazy?
he thinks i stole a million dollars from him .
this is a dying man .
he's nuts .
he's totally fucking paranoid .
do you realize what you just said to me?
if i don't do it , he's going to have me killed .
it's that simple .
so that means you're gonna have to bust into prison?
what do you think , i'm crazy?
he's gonna swim off the island .
gonna swim?
yeah .
he's gonna drown .
not if you and i pick him up ... ... in that .
tony's got a guy on the inside who'll get him in the water .
i know these channels like the back of my hand .
we cross little neck bay into the north corner to pick him up .
there's a buoy about 100 yards offshore .
that's where he's gonna be .
this is in and out , half hour tops .
he's gonna jump off a barge ... ... swim 100 yards ... ... to a buoy in the east river?
impossible .
it's too rough .
he's going to die .
that's his fucking problem .
there's no point in arguing .
i have to do this .
i'm asking for your help .
you're a lawyer , man .
what the fuck is happenin 'to you?
i don't know .
i am so fucking shook up , i cannot see straight .
i'm in an impossible fucking situation here .
once i get tony on the shore ... ... there is a distinct possibility that he and his goombah son ... ... have got some plans for me .
what do you mean , " plans "?
what kind of plans?
how do i know he's not gonna kill me?
this guy hates my guts .
i'm in trouble .
i am in fuckin 'trouble here .
you are the only fucking person on earth ... ... that i can trust .
and i'll give you $50, 000 to go along .
if i go along , it ain't for the money .
are you in?
when is this ...
i don't know !
his son's gonna call me .
are you in?
all right , i'm in .
thank you .
surprise .
i was asleep .
can i come in?
i bought you some cheesecake .
i don't like cheesecake .
you wouldn't have buzzed me up , if you wasn't gonna let me in .
i'm saying no , charlie .
what can i do?
what are you gonna do?
are you gonna ... ... bust the chain?
chase me around the apartment?
get me naked?
take me on the floor?
i'm too old for that .
that's too bad .
if you can't get in ... ... you don't get in .
where's my cheesecake?
can i ask you a personal question?
anything .
did you ever kill anybody?
i'm sorry .
well , it's just not a simple question .
i just can't answer it like ...
that's all right .
you don't have to ... ... there it is .
you don't have to answer .
when i was a kid in east harlem ... ... the wops said ... ... no spics could go east of park avenue .
no 'ricans west of fifth avenue .
that don't leave you much room to maneuver .
say you want to go to central park , play with the ducks .
you're shit outta luck .
so what do you do?
you go anyway .
i'm up on 106th street , central park , near the lake .
i get caught by these copiens .
right?
they surround me .
so i get my blood up , pull out my blade .
come on !
i'll take any one of you mothers !
no , man .
we're gonna kill your ass . " out come the zip guns .
homemade gun .
you pull the hook back , catch that bullet square , ping .
hit you in the head , man , you got serious problems .
that was the last chase on me like that ... ... because from then on i carried my own piece .
guys went down , yeah , but it ain't like , you know , you just ... ... decide one day , and then that's it .
no .
you just do what you gotta do to survive .
somehow , you know , you just end up where you are .
that's how everybody ends up where they are .
everybody .
only i'm gettin 'out .
i'm gonna rent cars .
what're you laughing at?
everybody laughs at that .
that's a dream .
i know , i'm sorry .
didn't you ever have a dream?
of course i did .
the diamond room isn't exactly the end of my rainbow , you know .
it's just ...
i don't know .
just sometimes i hear myself talk ...
... about new agents and auditions , and i'm trying to be so optimistic .
then i think ... ... why should i be so optimistic?
yeah , i had a dream ... ... but now i'm awake ...
... and i hate my dream .
maybe it's time i started thinking about doing something else .
maybe someplace else too .
seems like every day i'm finding something new i like about gail .
i keep workin 'my points about us gettin 'out of new york ... ... going to live in the bahamas together , permanent .
she ain't sayin 'much , but ... ... i can tell the idea is growin 'on her .
money's comin 'in steady now .
it won't be much longer till i got what i need .
this dream of mine , it's so close ... ... i can touch it .
where you going?
wait , no .
i'm tired .
i'm an old man .
i need a rockin 'chair .
come on !
please !
let me watch you .
i love to watch you .
go ahead .
there it is .
i'm sorry !
look at that !
here's a bunch of us at the copa .
everybody dancin ', drinkin 'dom perignon .
everything paid for by kleinfeld .
won't even let you put your hand in your pocket .
always sneakin 'off , payin 'the waiter .
but he has that bad drinker face .
his eyes are gettin 'beadier and beadier these days .
should have seen it coming .
don't stop .
please don't stop .
look at that move .
you're gonna let this fuckin 'goombah paw your woman like that?
they're just dancin '.
don't you appreciate that , the movement , the rhythm?
what i don't appreciate , he's got his fucking hands all over her ass .
he don't have his hands over her ass .
i believe those are her hips .
look at the shithead .
these wise guys think they're so hard assed .
i am so sick of hoods like that ... ... coming into my office , my office ... ... thinkin 'they can push me around .
you should tell him what you think .
why hold somethin 'like that inside?
why not get something like that off your chest?
it's a terrible thing to carry around .
i will .
i think you should .
i will .
see how interested he's gonna be in your comments .
what're you doin '?
are you outta your mind?
what's that?
yeah , you , wop .
me?
you , spaghetti dick .
wait .
okay , okay .
i'm talking to you .
yeah , you .
you're talkin 'to me?
just ignore him .
he's drunk .
what'd he say?
sit down !
who does he think he is?
no problem .
come on .
let's have a drink .
come on , everybody .
can you believe this loser?
let's go back to the table .
people have no sense of humor .
let's go .
i was just fooling around .
i'd never let anything happen .
carlito and me , we take care of each other .
he knows .
right , kid?
come on .
you're a beautiful woman .
you don't get seasick on boats , do you?
no , i don't .
good .
just asking 'cause of our little boat trip tomorrow night .
just drop it .
just tryin 'to cover all the bases .
it's comin 'up , you know .
you two going somewhere?
no big deal .
just a little boat ride .
why don't you just let it go?
it's dull what you're doin '.
what's the problem?
it's just fuckin 'dull .
i'm just askin 'a simple question .
what's the matter?
you're actin 'like an asshole .
if a guy's goin 'on a boat , you wanna know if he gets seasick .
it could be important .
what boat?
what boat are you talking about?
what boat , charlie?
if you ever talk that shit again in front of her , i'm gonna kill you .
what's the matter with him?
i don't like him .
didn't like him the minute i met him .
you're just not listenin 'to me .
all right .
so what is this boat thing then?
what is that asshole manipulating you into?
tell me .
just helpin 'him out with something , that's all .
i owe him .
you owe him?
he's a fucking cokehead !
i can't believe you hang around with that guy .
he's sick .
he's gonna get you killed , or sent back to prison .
he saved my life !
so now you have to pay him with it?
jesus christ , charlie , you give me this whole song and dance ... ... about how you're out of that shit , but you're not .
song and dance?
what does that mean , " song and dance "?
you're not .
where'd you get that?
from what?
why'd you drag me into this?
drag you into what?
why'd you make me believe all the crap about bahamas and paradise?
i feel ridiculous !
'cause you haven't changed !
you haven't changed a bit !
what the fuck are you tryin 'to tell me?
that my gettin 'out is just some bullshit fantasy trip i'm layin 'on you?
is that what you're sayin '?
how could you say that?
how can you say that when you know how close i am?
how could you say those words to me?
i gotta do this , just this one thing , and then i'm out .
i owe dave .
you don't owe him shit !
you think you do .
that's the problem .
that's why nobody like you gets out .
you're not listening .
everything you learned in the neighborhood ... ... won't do anything but get you killed !
how do you know what i learned in my neighborhood?
this is stupid what you say .
i know how this dream ends .
it isn't in paradise .
it ends with me carrying you into sutton emergency room ... ... at 3 : 00 a . m .
and standing there ... ... crying like an idiot ... ... while your shoes fill with blood and you die .
you won't listen to me ...
'cause you're bullshitting me !
you're not listening to me !
dave is my friend .
i owe him .
that's ... ... who i am .
that's what i am , right or wrong .
i can't change that !
whatever he wants you to do ... ... don't do it .
for me , please , don't do it .
please .
just don't do it .
that's the last time i wipe up your blood !
came the big night , and right away i didn't like it .
kleinfeld was coked out of his mind ... ... the flaps of his nose , all red and swollen .
bad start , jack .

we're fallin 'out of position .
we're gonna stand you up and say good night .
get him on the other side .
one , two , three .
there's a line you cross you don't never come back from .
point of no return .
dave crossed it .
i'm here with him .
that means i'm goin 'along for the ride , the whole ride ... ... all the way to the end of the line , wherever that is .
i had to do it .
he never would've let me live .
i know , you're pissed .
i'm gonna throw in another $10, 000 .
i'm gonna send over the whole $60, 000 in cash tomorrow .
all right?
it's gonna look like the kid tried to spring the old man , boat flipped , they drowned .
maybe they got their heads split by a scow or barge just for good measure .
this is never gonna come back to us .
trust me .
you ripped him off , didn't you?
who?
tony t. you did take the million dollars , didn't you?
yeah .
you ain't a lawyer no more , dave .
you're a gangster now .
you're on the other side .
whole new ball game .
you can't learn about it in school , and you can't have a late start .
don't worry about me .
one more thing .
we're even .
let's get a drink .
say it !
we're even .
we're even .
we ain't never gonna sell these tickets ... ... whackin 'a boss and his kid .
these italians , i work with 'em , i know 'em .
they will read this one with their eyes closed .
i gotta keep movin '.
most people will .
you get old enough ... ... you remember a reason why everybody wants to whack you .
you believe 'em all ... ... but you know somebody's gotta be lyin '.
or maybe they're all lyin '.
when you can't see the angles no more , you're in trouble , baby .
you're in trouble .
there's a patrolman williams on the line .
put him on .
mr. kleinfeld?
this is patrolman williams .
we're down here at your garage .
your license plate is dk 777?
yeah .
is there a problem?
somebody tried to steal your mercedes .
there was an accident .
there was an accident?
yeah .
is it badly damaged?
i'm afraid so .
i'll be right down .
i'll be ten minutes .
come on .
mr. taglialucci says to hold that for him !
wait up .
i can't talk .
i have an appointment .
you were right about kleinfeld .
he's a bad guy .
me and him are finished .
i can't talk .
i'll call you , okay?
slow down .
what is it?
am i on the outs with you?
is that it?
yeah .
that's crazy .
what's wrong with you?
i have a lot on my mind .
can we please talk later?
i just wanted you to know you were right about kleinfeld .
i'm sorry if you're upset .
i gotta go .
i have a doctor's appointment .
what's the matter?
you sick?
no , i'm late .
we'll take a cab .
what's wrong?
no , charlie , i'm late !
i'm late !
you mean you ...
not for long , okay?
what does that mean?
i'm not gonna have a kid who's not gonna have a father .
we gotta talk about this .
mr. brigante , my name is duncan .
oh , my god .
i'm here to escort you to mr. norwalk in the district attorney's office .
i got nothin 'to say to him unless i'm under arrest .
mr. norwalk has a tape he'd like to play for you .
unless i'm under arrest , i ain't goin 'anywhere , especially without my lawyer .
mr. kleinfeld took a knife in the chest at 2 : 00 this afternoon .
i advise you to come with us .
we may be the only friends you've got .
i'm going , too .
kleinfeld's lucky to be alive .
we're holding him at east side hospital .
we want his ass healthy when we send it upstate .
you're sendin 'him upstate?
what for?
david kleinfeld became a very big fish while you were gone .
even bigger than you .
he's dirty .
money laundering , jury tampering , bribery .
we've been after him for some time now .
i don't know nothin 'about that , so ...
there's a lot you don't know .
bill , you got no case here .
you know it and i know it .
chances are , you won't even get an indictment .
wanna try your luck?
look , let's not both waste our time .
you said maybe i could help myself .
you're not taping this , are you?
gimme a little credit .
all right .
i thought of something you might want .
you get off me , i'll help you put carlito brigante back inside .
brigante?
for what?
after he got out , he started coming to my office and making a lot of phone calls .
i found out he was back with rolando rivas , his old partner , dealin 'coke .
and i'm talkin 'serious numbers .
would you testify to that?
absolutely .
we don't believe him .
word on the street is you've been clean since you came out of prison .
kleinfeld's the one we're after .
he was right .
i'd never get an indictment with what i had .
but now , with your help ... ... we can put this filth away for a long time .
hermano ... ... we know about tony t.
who's tony t.?
yeah , right .
his body popped up in the east river yesterday , and his kid , frankie's .
somebody was trying to bust tony outta prison .
i don't know these people you mentioned .
i don't know them .
tony t. had another son besides frankie , vincent .
seems vincent went crazy after those bodies popped up .
let it out all over the street that kleinfeld set up that prison break ... ... then killed his father and his brother .
we aren't saying you were on that boat too .
but knowing your relationship with kleinfeld , that's a good possibility .
don't you think , hermano?
i don't like boats .
all right , here's the deal .
if you were on that boat , and i know goddamn well you were ... ... testify against kleinfeld for first degree murder .
you'll receive complete immunity and a couple airline tickets to the bahamas .
you wanna get even with kleinfeld?
here it is on a silver platter .
i would love to help you , but i can't .
i don't know what you're talking about .
i don't know these people .
i don't know what you're sayin '...
let me tell you somethin ', mr. convicted dope peddler ... ... if we can guess you were on that boat , how long before the italians do , too?
what if they get to kleinfeld?
they can twist his arm .
you think he won't give you up?
think again !
you don't owe kleinfeld nothing .
the shyster tried to set you up .
bury you , jack .
that it?
i wanna hear from you by noon tomorrow .
you think you're gonna sail off into the sunset , asshole?
think again .
you gotta do it .
they're giving you no choice .
you want out , go ahead .
you can turn around , walk away , never look back .
i would understand .
but i got a plan .
i got a way outta this .
pull over here , please .
what's going on?
just wait five minutes .
where are you going?
wait here five minutes .
what is that?
tickets on an overnight train to miami .
nobody's gonna look for us on the train .
we hit miami , we catch a plane to nassau .
what about the club?
your money?
fuck the club .
i already got $70, 000 in a safe .
my friend in the islands can float us the rest .
let's do it .
let's get outta here .
all three of us .
we're runnin 'out of time , babe .
the dream don't come no closer by itself .
we gotta run after it now .
i know , it's not the way i planned it either , but it is how it is .
i'm gonna go to the club , get my money , and i'm goin 'straight to grand central .
train leaves 11 : 30 for miami .
you're gonna be there , gail?
you'll be there?
i'll be there .
i love you .
just make sure you're there .
i'll see you later .
train leaves in five hours , and i'm angling like crazy in my head .
norwalk'll blow over .
he won't come out of the country if he can't bust me here .
but he ain't my only problem .
five hours left .
can i think of everything?
cover everybody .
tie all the shoelaces .
gotta listen to my instincts ... ... like the one tellin 'me that face and that uniform don't go together .
just one last piece of business .
gotta look in kleinfeld's eyes .
gotta know for sure .
who are you?
kleinfeld is my lawyer .
hands on the wall .
go ahead .
relax .
it's your pal .
scared the hell out of me .
cop's not supposed to let anybody in .
it's you , it's okay , but ...
cops ain't gonna protect you .
the mob is looking for you .
i know .
where the fuck have you been?
what do you got here?
where you been?
how do you feel?
i'm not feeling very well .
where the fuck have you been?
i've been to norwalk's office .
i heard the tape .
that pig .
never give up your friends , no matter what .
they doctor these things , play 'em outta context .
i can't believe you are such a ...
don't fuckin 'do that !
fuck you !
what the fuck are you doing?
would you fuckin 'put that away?
it's loaded !
fuck you and your self righteous code of the goddamned street .
did it pull you out of a thirty year stint in five years?
did it?
no , i did .
did it get you acquitted four fucking times?
no , it didn't .
i did .
so fuck you , fuck the street .
your whole goddamn world's this big ... ... and there's only one rule : you save your own ass .
save your own ass .
save your own ass .
see this?
it belongs here .
not behind a pillow .
this way you can reach for it quick .
they come in , you ready for 'em .
so long .
you got a beautiful future .
quittin 'time .
you're early .
a few minutes .
finish your paper?
it's all yours .
thanks .
be good .
there's a delivery for you , mr. kleinfeld .
from who?
from my father ... ... and my brother .
adios , counselor .
where the hell you been?
you know somebody tried to kill kleinfeld?
i heard about it .
listen , me and gail are goin 'out of town for a couple days .
you're gonna get married .
listen to me .
i want you to go to gail's house , pick her up , drive her to grand central .
i want you to wait with her there for me .

pete amadesso walks into my club just like that .
bullshit .
there's an angle here .
pete's a made guy .
his uncle's a heavy hitter with the pleasant avenue bunch .
what's he doin 'here?
probably tony t. 's people sent him .
maybe he's watchin 'me , seein 'if i break .
waitin 'for me to panic .
they still don't know for sure if i was on that boat .
they think , but they don't know .
'cause if they knew , i'd already be dead .
right now , they just watchin 'me .
he was always one of us .
that was a guy .
