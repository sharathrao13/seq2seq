here you go .
thank you .
i'll be right back with your order .
good morning , bill .
let me guess .
pancakes , side of bacon .
who's dying?
come on , pick it up .
phil , big papa , please?
i need 15 .
i love it when you call me big papa .
hey , you're up early today .
okay , you're good to go .
is this yours?
does that line ever work?
what's the problem here?
it's hot !
here you go .
sorry .
why not?
my grandfather was a lawyer .
plus , i have a logical mind .
and you're only , like , what? $299, 000 short of what you need for law school?
piece of cake .
piece of pie .
piece of ass .
so what would you do?
i don't know .
liar .
you know , i was thinking i could go back to school full time .
and quit here?
i won't allow it , slim .
careful , it's hot .
sorry , sir .
ever try the roc?
what?
it's the deodorant thing .
it's like salts or something .
you rub it on your pits .
it looks like some kind of hippie crystal .
are you saying i sweat?
no , you just ....
do i smell?
no .
god ....
ladies?
okay .
your turn .
i'm sweating too much .
you waiting for somebody?
something to drink?
just water , thanks .
i'll give you a minute to look at the menu .
that's okay .
i was in here yesterday , slim .
what's your real name?
no .
i like it .
don't you think it's kind of negative , though?
no , i don't tell my name .
okay .
give me the soup , turkey burger , coleslaw , couple of extra slices of tomato .
i write books .
do you read books?
what are you reading now?
you know finnegans wake by james joyce?
my friend told me it's the hardest book in the english language .
i mean , not the hardest , but the hardest one that you can actually read .
i thought to myself , if i can get through it , i could probably read the rest .
how long have you been reading it?
six years .
i'll be back with your soup .
he likes you .
he's a dick .
he was in here yesterday , you know?
i know .
now he's back today , he brought a rose , he pulls you into conversation .
okay , so he likes me .
so , do you like him?
i don't know him .
what's that got to do with anything?
he's a major piece of cake , piece of pie .
trust me , okay?
he's carrot cake .
and when a guy like that , who's actually cuter than you , likes you ....
he's cuter than me?
face it , no one will ever go for you because of your looks .
that sucks , because my personality bites .
cup of soup .
you don't really write books , do you?
no .
i haven't really been reading finnegans wake either .
i'm going into law ... ... enforcement .
who's the rose for?
enjoy your grub .
hey !
you .
how much did you settle on?
excuse me?
the bet .
how much is it?
you and your friend , yesterday , was it $200?
was it $500?
what was it?
what?
he bet his friend ... ... that he could get into your pants by noon tomorrow .
is this your business?
are you the morals police?
take it easy , man .
i was just having some fun .
what was it? $200 or $500?
i want to know what i'm worth .
the bet was for $200 .
but now that i know you ... ... way too high .
don't come back here again ... ... ever .
i'm sorry to get in your business .
no .
thanks .
i can't believe you actually said something .
i'd have felt bad about it ... ... if i d have kept quiet .
good luck .
please tell me , phil , as mitch was rather vague ... ... is her father dead , too?
well , he is to her .
he left when she was maybe two or three .
then i m happy to pay for the wedding .
yes , we're very happy .
you sure you love me?
forever and ever?
you're safe with me , slim .
you're safe , and it's okay to be happy .
we deserve it .
wait , so this was during or after college?
during .
what's wrong with you?
no , i mean , why did you and slim break up?
i m terrible in bed .
plus , she had to drop out , some money problems ... ... and so we kind of evolved into being friends .
what do you think?
can i take you home right now?
lf you've got a sense of humor .
my kids are out for tonight
i live in seattle .
women always want the possibility of long term .
i didn't just propose .
i just thought that maybe we could ... ... have a brief , totally unsatisfying sexual encounter .
i m your guy .
excuse me , i m sorry , i m sorry ... ... but i ve got to get up at 5 : 00 in the morning to buy green beans .
now ... ... i know you don't need it , but it's tradition in my family ...
... to give money to the groom .
that's sweet .
thank you , phil .
and thank you for giving me away today .
you're the best substitute father a girl ever had .
no substitute .
i m the real thing .
thank you .
he really loves you .
yeah .
you gonna give me babies , slim?
yeah .
how soon?
how soon can we get out of here?
hi .
hello .
we've been driving around ... ... and my wife has fallen completely in love with your house .
yes , it's great , isn't it?
we want to buy it .
she wants it for our family .
well , it's ....
we're not selling .
sure you are .
that's the price .
don't worry , it's well over market .
you're out of your mind .
i know , that's just it .
so before you say no again ... ... think how miserable one determined , crazy person can make you .
miserable today , tomorrow , pretty much every day , until the day you sell .
your kids are grown , you'll be happier in a smaller place .
parker , how are you?
how's the jump shot?
mitch !
not now , sweetie . it s slim .
give me a second .
yeah?
what?
hey , parker !
parker , give me a ride to the hospital .
look after the client .
she looks just like my baby pictures .
don't you?
who was that?
i don't know .
who cares?
some construction thing .
bring her here .
let me see .
that's my baby , that's my baby .
what do you got there?
okay .
let's put it out here .
what's that one?
hey .
hey .
should i join you?
no .
i m about to get out .
i m just showering to wake myself up .
i got to go back to work .
sorry .
yeah .
me , too .
hi , darling .
where are you?
you just paged my husband , right?
oh , my god .
mitch?
who are you?
what's your name?
i'm so sorry , i
no , it's too late to deny it now .
your name?
i have to go .
don't hang up .
don't be a coward .
just tell me your name .
that's the least you could do , don't you think?
i'm darcelle .
i'm very sorry .
hey .
she paged you .
who?
number 33 .
darcelle .
i guess you're late .
she's french?
she's not important .
no?
you're important .
yeah .
and gracie .
i must be brain dead .
i must be the biggest moron on the planet because i thought we were happy .
were we happy?
and i used to think we were so lucky .
and i thought in bed we were still ....
slim , please .
no .
you said i was safe with you .
you are .
you are .
i promise .
i m sorry .
i m so sorry .
i m sorry .
everything is going to be okay .
i can smell her .
what?
her perfume .
darcelle , or whoever .
we just had a drink .
stop it !
you're caught !
i caught you !
and you won't talk your way out of this .
how many , mitch?
how many are there?
how many have there been?
what does it matter?
it's not that our sex life hasn't been good .
it's been great , slim .
but i m a man .
men and women have different needs ... ... and that's okay .
darcelle's ....
she's willing to take care of that , and maybe that's better for everybody .
it's better for you !
you have a pretty good deal , don't you?
you go out , you fool around !
i sit here , take care of your house and kid .
well , no more , mitch !
that's it !
the party is over !
calm down .
i won't do this anymore .
i won't sit here and take it , and take it , and take it .
sorry !
i love you , yes .
but i am not a doormat !
i'm your wife .
i m your wife .
and you cannot do this to me !
you cannot do this to me anymore .
what?
i can't hit you?
no , you can't .
you want to fight?
i m a man , honey , it's no contest .
you have to understand , and i thought you did .
i make the money here , so i set the rules , right? it s my rules .
you're with me?
it's your rules .
yeah .
and what if i don't like the rules?
lf you don't like them?
come on , sweetie , life isn't just stuff we like , is it?
we have to take the good with the bad .
that's what marriage is .
so , for you , maybe today is a bad day .
tomorrow may be great .
tomorrow will be great .
yeah .
today ... ... is the price you pay for having such a good life .
i m going to go out .
this will be better , don't you think?
i don't have to sneak around and pretend i m going to work .
i m going to darcelle's .
i'll be back in a few hours .
just so you don't do anything later you might regret .
okay?
who are you calling?
your mother .
what will you tell her?
i was supposed to bring gracie by tomorrow , so i better cancel .
you know , love is a scary thing .
how powerful it is , what it does to you .
that is what happened here .
see , if i ever think of ....
i just ....
i can't ....
i refuse to live without you .
i think you understand what i m saying .
hey , you're late .
where have you been?
you are late .
i was worried you weren't coming at all .
no gracie?
we will have a regular girls 'luncheon ... ... and we will gossip about absolutely everybody .
my poor baby .
my god .
honey , i am so sorry .
what did you do?
what did you say to him?
men are like land mines .
some you trigger the first week , others it's years in .
the problem is you want a man man .
meaning his veins run thick with testosterone , which is good .
but then he can turn around without any warning and ... ... hit you .
i m not this person .
i m not a person whose husband beats her up .
i know .
what do i do?
you got to go to the cops .
he's the father of my child , okay?
i will not put him in jail !
hold on .
i m sorry .
i m sorry , okay?
sit down .
relax for a second .
i m just saying that either you endure this ... ... and you live it out like you're in some goddamn country western song ... ... or you take the kid , you take gracie and you get out .
mrs. hiller , how are you?
your husband got her .
i must've forgotten .
gracie was totally psyched .
i told him he should do it more often .
mitch !
toots !
gracie !
is that my little croissant?
no , it's your loaf of bread .
oh , hi .
how is it going?
where are you?
zoo .
why didn't you tell me  i called you at home , left messages .
hey , daddy .
come here .
it's your mom , honey .
mom , the elephants are peeing .
she's a little excited .
hey , dad , here .
come here .
look at the giraffe .
so , when are you guys going to be home?
i don't know .
i'll take her for a pony ride , maybe get a cotton candy .
you want a cotton candy , honey?
i'll see you later .
'bye , mommy .
made me nervous when i couldn't reach you today .
i thought you were going to cancel with my mother .
and you have to go crying to the old gang at the greasy spoon .
whatever happened to privacy?
i guess it's dead , along with chivalry and fidelity .
tell me .
do you have any idea ... ... how bad things can get?
educate me .
slim , i m a determined man .
i was determined to have you , and i did .
this house , my company ....
i am and always will be a person who gets what he wants .
and i still want you .
you can either accept that ... ... or you can fight it .
which way do you want to go?
i want to be happy .
good .
can i help you?
yeah .
i have a friend whose husband beats her up .
she should come in here and file a complaint .
lf she has physical evidence of abuse on her person ... ... we'll go out and arrest him .
lf he has money , he can bail himself out .
that's true .
then he's free till it goes to trial .
lf it goes to trial .
it's up to the city's attorney's office whether to prosecute .
okay , so ... ... she comes in here , she has him arrested ... ... and pisses him off ... ... then there's no guarantee that he won't come after her once he's out .
she could get a protection order .
what's that?
a little piece of paper that says he can't come around?
and when he comes around , what does she do , throw it at him?
she calls us .
and what about the kid?
is the ....
ls the paper good for the kid , too?
there's a child involved?
that's a matter for the family courts .
but unless she can prove that he's a danger to the child ... ... she can't legally bar him access .
miss !
miss !
maybe she didn't hear the signal .
no , she heard it .
no .
i think maybe teddy is right .
maybe she could still be sleeping .
she's not sleeping , okay , phil?
she's coming any second .
okay , do it again .
put her down .
we should go in .
it'd be crazy if we woke him up .
plus , she's going to flick the lights if anything is wrong .
right?
yeah .
another step and you're dead .
oh , my god !
you don't understand .
you've broken into our house .
she's alive .
the lights are out .
i can't see who you are .
i could kill you free and clear .
sir , please .
where's gracie?
she's here .
we are happy to leave , mitch , with slim and miss gracie .
and make no mistake . lf you keep them here , we will go straight to the police ... ... who will surely arrest you with a great deal of pleasure .
i don't want to say this in front of the group ... ... but you are just a rug head .
lf you go to the cops , it will be her word against mine .
and they will find drugs in her bureau or her car , or whatever .
trust me on that .
i il have custody of gracie by the end of the week .
no .
help me .
i got to get her out of here .
enough with her .
get out .
wake up , baby .
wake up .
look at your papa .
we're going for a little ride .
look at your papa .
help them up .
get the bag .
look at your papa .
i il see you soon .
'bye , sweetie .
and she's tied up because ... ... once a mean guy got her , tied her up ....
could be a broken rib .
you could play with her ears .
flicks her ears out .
at least it's not my face this time .
where are we going?
hospital .
no .
i m fine .
you are not .
where to , phil?
hospital .
i don't want to take her to the er in the middle of the night .
she needs someplace safe where she can sleep .
we could go to my house .
no .
he knows where you live .
he knows where we all live .
yeah .
one queen size bed is all right?
yeah , it's just me and my daughter .
i m sorry .
this card has been refused .
would you like to try another?
i m sorry , mrs. hiller .
the funds in your account seem to be frozen .
i love motels .
me , too .
hotels , too .
yeah , more potato .
i m going to bounce on the bed .
okay , toots .
be careful .
hello .
hey , there .
not too high .
what?
i m talking to gracie .
we're watching some tv , getting ready to hit the sack .
look , mom .
what about what we talked about?
no .
no shelters .
she hasn't been tainted by anything so far ...
... and i want to keep it that way .
okay .
i understand .
can we talk about this tomorrow?
piece of cake .
piece of pie .
'bye .
come on , toots .
ready for bed .
what's " tainted "?
is that like " painted "?
gin , i said tomorrow , okay?
not exactly the biltmore , is it?
it's the information age , sweetheart .
you leave a trail everywhere .
especially when your best friend rents your room with her credit card .
i had to do that since someone froze all my accounts , right?
we need to talk .
no , we don't .
please .
if we do this the hard way , you know who will suffer .
i'm not talking about you , honey .
i mean gracie .
you don't want her touched or affected by something bad or undesirable .
what?
" tainted , " right?
that's what tainted means .
who's banging on the door?
i don't know .
why?
what's going on?
mom , i m scared .
it will be okay , baby .
slim !
hold the bus !
hold the bus !
go , go , go !
open the door .
open it .
los angeles seattle?
that fare is $409 round trip .
how would you like to pay for that?
cash .
i always thought you'd come back here with me , but not eight years later .
well , if i had known how pretty it was ....
this place really sparkles !
you know what they call it?
the emerald city .
isn't that where dorothy is?
no , sweetie , that's where dorothy goes in her dream .
where is she when she wakes up?
back in kansas .
all right , game time .
duck your heads .
pigeon poop .
why did you come to me?
i tried to think of the last time that i felt safe .
then i saw your face .
and , i wanted a place that ... ... m l t c h wouldn't think of .
and someone who was stupid enough to do it .
yeah .
anybody here like hot fudge sundaes?
yeah .
i do .
i do .
yeah .
fbl .
can we talk?
go ahead .
would you mind opening up?
i'm investigating a kidnapping .
i'd like to look around .
you got a warrant?
you letting us in or not?
hold on a second .
can i see the warrant?
watch the front .
who are you looking for?
mister , unless you leave right now , i'm calling the police .
jeez , that's a scary thought .
i married a cop .
i don't need their bullshit right now .
that's enough .
do you hear me?
it's time to go .
now !
you're not fbl , okay .
i know who hired you .
do you know what it's like to have a knife hit your carotid?
no .
do you know what it's like to die because you're really stupid?
no , i really don't .
john boy .
this is not listed on the program .
they're not here .
let's ride .
can't i just  no !
not today .
your phone .
'night , john boy .
are you okay?
i m fine .
i needed a shave anyway .
i m sorry .
i shouldn't be here .
sure you should .
no .
i can't keep putting people i love in danger .
what danger?
they killed my sofa .
hello .
joe .
this is mitch hiller .
it's him .
hello .
how are you?
i assume slim's called you?
yeah .
of course .
could you give her a message?
if she calls back again , i mean?
i don't know .
i m on her side , not yours .
her side .
what did you expect , mitch?
really?
come on , joe .
you're a smart guy .
let me say two words to you , okay?
lug nuts .
you don't want to worry they are loose every time you pull on the freeway .
how about the windows in your apartment?
are they still locked?
person could go crazy thinking about stuff like that .
you think those thugs are coming back?
it doesn't make any difference .
sure it does .
you don't have to go .
they're not coming back tonight .
you know that it is not safe for you if i stay here .
you can come back any time .
tomorrow , the next day .
maybe i'll take you up on that one day .
where will you go?
what will you do?
jupiter , girl out there says she's your daughter .
she insists on seeing you .
she can't possibly be my daughter .
i haven't had sex since 1995 .
not in this country , at least .
not her .
me .
i m your daughter .
what year were you born?
you are my father , jupiter .
i wrote you , like , 20 times .
but even when mom died you didn't answer .
i didn't have enough money to bury her .
don't blame me .
i didn't kill her .
no .
you had help .
that's a stupid thing to say .
what do you want?
money?
i wanted gracie to meet her grandpa .
hi .
and , yes , we need money to survive .
look , sweetheart ... ... from 1968 1972 , i had five kids .
maybe more .
half the people in that room could be my kid .
it's a running joke around here .
how will you feel when you wake up one day and find out your daughter is dead?
and you didn't do anything to help?
you're good .
the kid's a sweet touch , too .
but you're not the first to think of this gig since that fortune article .
so i'll give you the same thing i gave the other three . $6 .
enough to buy a sandwich .
but for you , i'll make it $12 .
make sure you buy the kid a sandwich , too .
i believe this originally belonged to you .
pawn it , since you're so hard up .
i'm sure it's worth more than $12 .
mommy , don't cry .
please don't cry .
mommy !
this way .
i m sorry .
this is the best we can do .
it's okay .
we're fine .
thanks .
who are all these people?
they're kind of friends of friends of phil .
what is it?
it's food , okay?
hi , i lost my birth certificate .
this is for you .
phil sent it .
are you surprised?
sure , we take care of you .
all right?
yesterday three men threatened to kill me if i helped you in any way .
fortunately for you , this aroused my interest .
but she may also be ....
i'm sending this to an old address , the diner where you worked .
if this reaches you and you need more ... ... leave word at my office .
jupiter .
what do we think?
we like it here?
why?
are we moving again?
no .
we just
good .
because i m sick and tired to death of moving .
me , too .
so here's the deal .
you can call me mom or you can call me erin , but you cannot call me slim .
i never call you slim .
i know , but just in case somebody asks you someday
i don't think you are that slim .
thanks a lot .
do i get a new name , too?
i guess . lf you want one .
excuse me !
yes?
hi .
betty?
yes?
i m erin shleeter .
i called you .
yes , i remember .
this is my daughter .
look at you .
you are so ....
what's your name?
queen elizabeth .
welcome , queen elizabeth .
you'll have a good time here .
may i call you " queen " for short?
i like talking to grandma , but every sunday ... ... do we have to drive for 55 hours ... ... just to reach some phone booth?
can i call daddy this time?
no .
please?
please?
don't beg .
you look like a dog .
you know he has friends in the police department ... ... and you're depriving him of his rights as a father , nonsense like that .
it's leading up to a big custody hearing .
what are you saying?
talk to him .
calm him down .
call him before he does something stupid .
it might help if he talked to gracie ... ... for hersake , too .
it's not healthy to be without a father .
we better keep this short .
i'll call you next week .
wait .
i want to speak to gracie
hi , daddy .
we're having a great vacation .
where?
we've been everywhere .
chicago and
no questions , okay?
or it ends now .
listen , bitch .
she's my daughter , too .
don't tell me how i can talk to her .
put me back on the phone with gracie .
give her the damn phone .
tell daddy that you love him and say goodbye .
gracie , you there , honey?
sweetheart , talk to me .
'bye , daddy .
honey , i'm sorry , baby .
daddy didn't mean to use bad words .
i m really , really sad .
gracie
i m sorry , kid .
it was my mistake .
mommy's just a big dummy .
what do you think?
her voice?
yeah , she sounds the same .
good .
'cause if she's changed her appearance
thanks , john .
i remember her .
i told you .
the diner .
the scam .
i don't remember why you broke the rules and decided to marry the bitch .
she's not a bitch .
sorry .
she is a waitress .
what does that mean?
means she's stupid .
call your mother .
now to call you .
she's not stupid .
she thinks if the calls are short they can't be traced .
i still want to know .
with all the girls that we pulled that on , why her?
maybe it's love .
yeah .
i know what that means .
if you were smart , you'd forget her .
i can't simply forget her .
she kidnapped my kid .
how many times do i have to go there?
it's not kidnapping .
kidnapping is when someone who isn't the mother takes the kid .
when the mother takes the kid , it's called parenting .
how soon can you get there?
i don't know .
you know , i could lose my job for this .
robbie ... ... you could lose your job for all the jobs you're doing besides doing your job .
you know what i mean?
you got to be reasonable .
i know some guys in detroit .
like your guys in seattle?
i don't think so .
i know what they're like .
they've never met her , never heard her voice .
she'll spot them and run before they even see her .
it's you , robbie .
it's you ... ... or it's you .
what do you think?
is it okay?
it's okay , right?
no , it's not .
it's horrible .
it's not horrible , mom .
yeah , but it's not good , is it?
mom , you tasted it .
you know what i think?
no , what's that?
i think you miss daddy .
daddy yells at me , toots .
well , you miss somebody .
there he is .
joe !
joe !
joe !
joe !
joe !
joe , over here !
hey !
how are you?
you're lucky i like you .
this is the most preposterous trip i've ever taken .
change your plane .
rent a car .
let's do it .
you guys hungry as i am?
seems like she's doing great .
yeah .
how about you?
you okay?
cut off from everybody , can't talk to your friends ....
gracie is safe .
so mitch is ....
when is this custody thing?
couple of months .
anyway , they favor the mother , so ....
yeah , they do .
but he has a lot of money , and a lot of lawyers .
that's kind of what i mean .
i mean , you can't run forever , slim .
why not?
i m good at it .
you are .
but , then again , you're good at everything .
wait , i m confused .
are you criticizing me or flirting with me?
let me get back to you on that .
hi , gracie .
is that your ball?
yes .
you want to see a trick?
yeah .
i don't hear the basketball .
do you?
she was just ....
gracie !
gracie !
gracie !
i mean , queen !
mommy !
mommy !
watch my new trick !
didn't i tell you to stay close?
come on .
do you remember the house rules?
who can forget , with gracie here?
joe .
what would have happened if we  don't .
it's wrong to think like that .
why?
because of gracie .
she's truly a great kid .
any path that doesn't include her doesn't make any sense .
ginny told me about that weekend .
of your wedding?
did she tell you how terrible i was?
joe , that might work with other people , but you forget .
i ve had you .
i didn't forget .
and i m telling you from experience ... ... you're not that bad .
do you have to go tomorrow?
yeah .
why?
why can't you quit your job and come here ... ... and play the horses , and become independently wealthy?
please , kiss me , slim .
i know we're not supposed to , and it's against house rules .
but for me to come all this way and feel the way i do
you're a great person , slim .
you're a great person .
just like your daughter .
can i get a chocolate kiss?
who wants to put two eggs in .
i want to put the eggs .
careful .
i want you back .
no .
it could be just like it was .
no !
that's pretty stupid .
you know why?
because if i can't have you , nobody will .
like that jerk who was here with you .
he'll be fishing for his guts .
you know what else?
for murder , they need a body .
otherwise , they'll think you ran away again .
only this time , you'll never come back .
mommy !
daddy , no !
stop , daddy !
stop it !
mommy !
stop , daddy !
stop !
go on , honey .
get in your seat .
get in the back .
strap yourself in .
put that on .
mommy , what's happening?
put it on .
put these on , too .
you .
car seat , honey .
then slow so i can .
i can't slow down right now .
bitch !
pull over .
pull the car over !
mommy , stop it !
hold on tight .
pull over .
shit !
come on .
mommy !
hold on , gracie , okay .
mommy !
come on !
it will be over soon .
we're almost there !
just hold on , okay?
you'll be all right , okay?
all right .
okay , toots .
let's talk .
you want me to tell you what happened?
fair enough .
first thing ... ... erin is over .
i liked erin .
and you are not the queen of england anymore .
okay?
i m hungry .
is everything okay here?
yeah , thanks .
hey there , little cutie .
what's your name?
i don't know .
hey , millie , 14 needs menus .
come on .
you'll be okay?
you're going to sit here , be mommy's good girl?
okay?
all right .
don't talk to any strangers .
be right back .
is mr. toller with someone?
no , but
good .
i m not a crazy person .
i swear .
wait a minute .
you can't  don't call security .
hi , mr. toller .
my name is erin ....
i mean , my name is slim .
i got your name from millie .
down at the diner , right down the block .
the thing is ....
my husband keeps trying to kill me .
you know?
see?
i need someone to talk to who is smart .
and i have money , you know .
i have money . $500 .
and you can have it .
you can have it all ... ... if you just listen to what ....
two minutes .
please .
thanks .
small person .
can you watch her?
thank you .
pardon my french , dear , but ... ... i hope you got some pleasure from it because you've really screwed yourself .
you had two chances to go to the police , file a complaint ... ... put his violence on record .
you ignored them both .
which tells him to keep on coming until he kills you .
as for gracie , you're going to the custody hearing?
yes , sir .
lf you didn't , the judge would rule against you , and you'd become a fugitive .
once you're there , your husband will , as you say , portray you as a drug addict .
for all i know , you are one .
you break in here uninvited .
i'd say your attacker has a very good chance of gaining sole custody .
lf you don't mind , put this away .
no , no .
take it .
is that it?
you won't help me?
that's what i m telling you .
it's too late .
there isn't anybody who can help you .
in good conscience , i should say ... ... the custody hearing is probably a trick .
it's not about itself .
it's a way to find you .
a way to get you in a particular place and time so his men can follow you ... ... and he can come to wherever you are ... ... and kill you .
okay .
now i got to make you a promise , grace .
ever since you were born ....
one day i started thinking of all the awful things that could happen .
people who you'd love would die ... ... or leave you , or betray you ... ... and break your heart .
or a guy would hurt you in some way .
and i thought to myself , if i could ... ... protect you from that , even once .
lf i could just ... ... absorb any of that myself .
here goes .
okay , you guys , keep up with me .
this is really busy here .
would you hold her hand , please?
this is the most ridiculous thing i've ever done .
oh , yeah?
how about horace?
okay , the second most .
rent a car , drive to reno , then fly to san jose .
are you out of your mind?
you noticed?
oh , my !
what happened?
i thought i m supposed to drive to reno .
i had to make sure you weren't followed .
okay .
hey , graceland .
how are you?
hey , gracie !
over here !
here are the tickets .
okay .
some cash and credit cards .
it's on me .
just don't call home .
or phil's .
okay .
think of it as a paid vacation you never had .
hey , toots .
you want to give mommy a hug?
come here .
say goodbye to me .
okay?
i'm going to miss you .
it's just for a little while .
a little kiss?
can i have a little smile before you go?
okay .
sweetie , why don't you sit up front , okay?
take care of her .
oh , honey .
i don't want you to worry , okay?
eric will have her dribbling behind her back the next time you see her .
thanks .
i m number 1 on the auto dialer .
call me , or i'll call you .
all calls , 15 seconds or less .
cake?
pie .
try to have fun .
hey , how long?
the custody hearing is in the next month , so ....
that's my deadline .
deadline for what?
relax .
close your eyes .
i m not here .
he's not here .
time !
relax .
breathe .
close your eyes .
close your eyes .
that's it .
go !
relax .
keep your balance .
you ready?
yes .
you sure?
can you lose?
no .
can he hurt you?
no .
even though he's bigger?
he's a lot bigger .
even though he's stronger?
he's a lot stronger .
get some rest tonight .
tomorrow we're gonna work on the ball .
look at me !
if he hits you ....
no way .
say it .
it takes twice as much energy to swing and miss as to swing and hit .
you think you're done for .
he's got you by the throat .
left arm up .
good .
rotate around .
drop that arm .
reach up , grab my hand .
there .
good .
so how do you win?
how?
i attack .
and what do you do after you attack?
nothing .
why nothing?
because i never stop attacking .
good !
do it !
use your legs .
keep that chin down !
that's it !
go !
go !
one last thing .
the hardest lesson .
we can't control the universe .
suddenly the maid enters .
you're distracted for an instant and he hits you .
that's not possible .
to win , we must prepare , even for the impossible .
we bend the universe to our will , but it will only go so far .
so you're saying ....
yes .
you're down .
lying there .
seemingly beaten .
but hear me .
hold on to my voice .
he's standing over you .
he thinks he's won .
and as sure as he's a coward , he will try to kick you .
yes .
but because you know what he'll do ... ... you're smiling inside .
how's that guy i set you up with?
he's good .
he teach you how to think?
i hope so .
did you find mitch?
he sold the house .
bought a place out near the marina .
i need a woman who looks like me .
5'5 " , 115 pounds .
an off duty cop or something .
she should have her hair cut short , too .
she should wear jeans and sneakers .
here's his address .
i got her a room at the washington square inn .
what's she for?
i need mitch to think i m here , in san francisco .
have her meet me , 5 : 45 , top floor of the vesuvio's .
today?
well , that's awful short notice .
i don't know
i thought jupiter was almighty , powerful , king of the gods .
yeah .
one more thing .
at some point , not right now because it would be phony ... ... i need you to acknowledge i m your kid .
you sure this will work?
you bet your life .
thanks .
i will .
and where is gracie?
well , she gets back the day after tomorrow .
and then we're gonna fly to la .
tell me something , please .
why is this call different?
well , you know , we were in the country then .
now we're in the city , meeting with my lawyers .
so , you know , there's lots of cell phones here .
so , there's no way they can trace this .
make sure you call me the minute you get back .
i can't wait to see my girls , okay?
hey , give me the ball , man !
coffee?
no , i got to get home .
change for work .
i'll call you .
you want my number?
sure .
thanks , for everything .
you , too .
i really appreciate it .
really .
lucy .
hey , baby .
no , i had to work late .
tonight's no good .
i have a flight to san francisco early tomorrow morning .
lf it was pleasure , you'd be going , too .
no , i have to go up and pick up my daughter .
yeah , the custody hearing is down here .
but it looks as if gracie is being taken to san francisco ... ... and my wife ... ... it seems as if she has completely vanished .
right off the face of the earth .
i doubt they'll ever find her this time .
i want her to meet you , too .
we'll call you as soon as we get back .
love you .
'bye .
hi .
what's up?
i m in .
thanks forletting me come talk about gracie .
i'm glad you're willing to admityour temper .
and let's not mince words .
the physical abuse you subjected me to .
perhaps with your new attitude , we can really work something out .
per your last letter , i'll see you the evening of ....
hey .
you okay?
say it again .
say what?
you know , what you told me .
you have a divine , animal right ... ... to protect your own life and the life of your offspring .
are you still there?
yeah .
stay on the line .
i want to see if this works .
it's me .
yeah .
and this morning?
you always did forget to turn off the coffee .
i found it , mitch .
it's a machine .
it knocks out cell phones .
found that gun , too .
scared?
of what?
now is when you decide , mitch .
whether you're a coward or not .
if you are , you can run .
go ahead , run .
you will shoot me with my own gun?
i threw them away .
then someone else is here with you .
no .
you're alone .
why not?
this is what you wanted , right?
what you were going to san francisco for?
the chance to get me alone?
yeah .
but what are you doing?
you want to fight me?
man to man?
woman , mitch .
yeah , that's what i mean .
man against woman .
you sure that's fair?
fair to whom?
no , i m sorry .
i can't do this .
can't do what?
this .
it's ridiculous .
you could hit me before , though , couldn't you?
when i was defenseless .
that's not going to
as i was saying , that's not going to do anything .
then what will do it?
are you such a coward that you can only hit me when i m not expecting it?
come on .
i don't understand , slim .
how does this work for you?
i mean , this is carefully thought out .
but say you do succeed .
you beat me up or whatever .
you won't murder me .
so all you've done is further piss me off .
self defense is not murder .
you don't have the guts .
come on .
it's not self defense when you break in here and attack me .
attack you?
all i did was slap you around a little bit .
you really think you're going to kill me and get away with it?
i told you .
self defense .
as arranged in our letters , i'm here to talk about gracie .
there are no letters .
sure there are .
in the drawer where your pistol was .
you just put your prints all over them .
you attacked me , i fought back .
lf something should happen ....
i don't care how long it takes .
i only have to hit you once .
just one good hit and it's over .
he bleeds .
you can count on one thing , baby .
even if i don't kill you , you'll never see gracie again .
you never will .
i m confused , mitch .
aren't you a man?
can't you hit me again , even once?
what do you think now?
all your training , all your practice ....
it's over , baby .
it's over .
hi .
i can't do it , gin .
what do you mean?
what happened?
i can't do it .
he'll come after you and after gracie .
i know all that , but i can't do it .
i m not a killer , gin .
i m not him .
i can't do this .
hello?
slim , are you there?
should i call the cops?
slim , answer me slim
hold on to my voice .
he thinks he's won .
and as sure as he's a coward , he will try to kick you .
some woman called .
ginny?
he's still in there?
armed?
dangerous?
looks like you're one of the lucky ones .
gracie !
mommy !
my baby !
where are we going now , mommy?
anywhere you want to go .
emerald city .
i was thinking the same thing .
i have something to show you , mommy .
you do?
show me .
something for you .
oh , my goodness .
look at all this .
where did you get all this stuff?
from hawaii .
