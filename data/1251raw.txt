only instead of ink , it was soaked in maple syrup .
or peppermint .
any flavor you wanted .
and you just open up your little pad .

and you press your finger on it and then you taste your finger .
peppermint .
any time of day .
or cherry .
wouldn't the pad get disgusting after awhile?
disgusting how?
l don't know .
you keep touching it with your filthy fingers .
couple of days that flavor pad's like some mattress you find at the dump .
you're right .
it's no good .

could be the apron , who the hell knows?
or maybe the feeling of power you get when there's a crowd .
one hand rolls dough , ties those babies off .
the other hand maybe works the soda , refills the mustard .
it's quite a thing .
l'll tell you a secret .
lf a pretzel is a quality pretzel , you don't need salt .

she has a complete flip out !
she flips out the room !
where'd she go?
i don't know .
some other wing .
but , buddy ... this ltaly thing is huge .

i think you just got to get some sleep .
you got to shut everything down .

knots?
who knows knots?
not you .
you know , i'm not popeye .
how did we not hear?
how do you not hear a horse fall off a car?
maybe he's not dead .
maybe he ran away .
lt's raining so hard , the horse might have fallen off
and floated , who knows , into a ditch .
there's a river that runs along this road .
he could be in it .
corky could be heading for the open sea .
my god , honey .

on the international front , investors are watching vanderpark enterprises .
ceo , nicholas vanderpark and newly appointed partner , tim dingman ...
arrive in italy to introduce to europe
their complete line of fecal removing product that's been so successful here .

guilt that you're wealthy .
you know what , we're partners now and we have money too .
you know what we'll do with ours?
we're going to sponsor the biggest rally for you that this town has ever seen .
we'll say that if anyone can say that vapoorize does damage to anything ,

it was very smooth .
everything went fine .
here's what i got to tell you .
we'll pay you the money , okay?

a little taste of honey .
ls that so bad? ls it?
but you win .
man , i fold .
greed has hardened your heart .
and money's poisoned your soul .
l'm out of here .
there's nothing as dangerous as large quantities of money .
that's why i've always remained an independent contractor , an odd job man .
l want no part of this .
take the arrow out of my back .
you will never see me again .
help me , god !
come on .
honey ...

hey .
l couldn't sleep .
i got to talk to you .
yeah , i got to talk to you too .
you know , this big rally tomorrow , i'm a wreck about it .
l got to give a big speech .
i'm not a speech guy .
are you kidding?
come on , those infomercials you did .
you're great in front of people .
really?
you thought i was good?
you never said a word about it .
because it was just another thing of yours that made me miserable .
what?
this is what i have to talk to you about .
sit down .
l killed corky .
you ...
when?
now , please , just don't say anything till i'm done , all right?
the day that you gave me the wine , remember?
l got drunk on the wine .
l actually was drunk from before .
i went into your yard and ...
so that's it .
there you have it .
well , you know , it sounds like it was an accident .
why didn't you tell me?
i should've told you .
that's the thing .
but i don't know what happened .
l felt guilty or something .
and i was just so wrapped up in the envy that i felt for everything you had .
lt's true what they say .
lt's like a little green monster that comes out and it just poisoned my head .
and , by the way , you did nothing wrong .
you followed your dream .
you did what you wanted to do .
l was always saying , " don't do it .
you did it and it worked .
look , you built a house , right?
that's all you did .
you built a house .
l mean , it's a big house .
i mean , it's a really big house .
lt's a large house .
it's a ...
i mean , it's ...
lt's gigantic , nick .
it's the white house .
you built the white house here , and we're in the shadow of it .
literally , every day at 4 : 00 , we're in its shadow .
that's not your fault .
you wanted to be friends still ,
you didn't want to move and i love that .
lt was coming from such a good place , but it was ...
lt really got to me because every day i'd have to look at you ,
and see you with all of this stuff .
you know , buy the yellow lamborghini that goes 500 miles an hour .
have a bowling alley next to your room .
lf i could do it , i would .
everybody should have a merry go round .
of course you should .
jealousy , every day .
and it was just chewing me up .
your kid's playing the concert piano , my kid's banging trash cans .
and that has nothing to do with money .
that's just his musical ability .
that's a whole other thing .
you just gave to us .
you gave and you gave and you're so generous .
and what am i going to give you?
l gave you tube socks for christmas last year .
that's not going to work .
i like the socks .
you gave us so much .
the coffee machine .
it's a beautiful , giant rocketship sized coffee machine .
debbie loved the coffee .
i'll tell you something , i never tasted it .
l wanted to tell you that .
l can't even tell you i haven't tried the coffee .
like i'll feel better if i don't drink your coffee .
and you gave our kids flan .
all of a sudden my son's going ,
daddy , where's the flan?
lt felt like a dagger in my heart every time he'd request flan .
lt made me feel little .
l felt like a little man who didn't like flan .
the horse was great , nick .
of course you should have a horse .
does it have to be a white horse that you come galloping up on ,
and it neighs and makes the whole thing?
of course .
make it a beautiful horse that i think , honestly , didn't like me .
lt had nothing to do with anything , i never clicked with it .
l think the horse sensed something .
i think " horse sense " is a real thing .
because the horse had a feeling .
he came over and sensed the envy i felt .
he'd come over and eat the apples .
he'd see me and give me a weird look .
l'm telling you .
you know how sometimes the side of a face and you get one eye?
he would keep the eye on me and i knew he was thinking something .
that's unrelated to what happened with the arrow .
that was an accident .
l swear to god .
i swear to god .
i couldn't do it if i tried .
l'm sorry about this .
i feel horrible .
i feel bad .
l feel like i have this fountain in my yard that i don't deserve .
l don't deserve to be your partner .
l don't deserve to be your friend .
i just ...
well , you know what , tim?
you made a mistake .
you're human .
everyone makes mistakes .
so what , man?
you're still my best friend .
really?
of course .
of course .
come on , man .
lt was a big mistake .
lt was a big mistake .
it was a doozy .
corky .
i'm sorry , nick .
no , no .
it's okay .
l know how much you loved him and i ...
l did love corky .
l never liked corky .
l mean , he's beautiful on the outside .
it's just something wasn't ...
we're still partners .
there is no way you are getting out of this partnership .
okay .
okay?
and i will see you tomorrow at the big rally .
yeah .
good .
big day .
big day .
poor corky .
one little target arrow .
you wouldn't think that could kill a great big horse .
that's exactly what i thought .
lt's one little arrow and when i shot the bum ...
he hardly seemed to notice .
you know , that fountain looked a lot better in rome .
yeah .
well ...
c'est la vie , as the romans say .
on this beautiful , clear day ,
l think it is appropriate that we clear the air
of the toxic distortions that my husband and , by association , myself ,
are somehow poisoning our environment in our efforts to purify it .
lt's not true .
no es verdad .
ladies and gentlemen ...
please help me welcome nick vanderpark and tim dingman .
thank you .
ladies and gentlemen , young people .
l stand here with my partner , tim dingman ...
that's right .
... grateful for this opportunity to address the central question
posed in so many colorful and eloquent variations .
where is the shit? !
my god .
nick .
nick !
corky?
mr. and mrs. vanderpark , sorry we had to perform an autopsy ,
but when any large dead animal comes in proximity with the public
it must be examined immediately for health reasons .
l'm a little curious .
did you feed your horse a lot of apples?
our neighbors have an apple tree .
corky loved their apples .
did he ever defecate in their yard?
i imagine .
can you tell me what you did when the horse defecated in your yard?
we used vapoorize because nick invented it .
we get crates of it for free .
well ...
lt's all making sense .
the horse was poisoned .
we did find a broken shaft of a small target arrow in the sternum ,
but that played no part in the horse's death .
the horse died from the prolonged ingesting of a certain chemical ,
which by itself is harmless , but when combined with certain fecal bacteria
becomes a lethal poison .
a little person?
lethal poison .
that chemical is the ingredient in every can of your so called miracle invention .
he had enough of it literally to kill a horse .
l am obligated , of course , to report this to the epa .
epa?
mmm hmm .
environmental protection agency?
do you have to do that?
right .
you have to .
it's all right .
every time without exception?
the next item , an extra large bed that sleeps nine comfortably ,
for , let's say , $1 00 .
xl bed , sleeping nine .
got to love it for $1 00 . $ 72 for this white statue of a man on a horse with a spray can . $ 72 , anyone?
no?
anybody need a portable phone?
everyone needs one .
you want one in your kitchen , in your extra bedroom .
you got a portable phone right there .
it's going to go for $5 .
the next thing is item 31 .
l like this bug net .
why don't we find out the estimated cost?
oh , we've got two cases of a semi gourmet flan .
l believe that's some sort of custard dish or something .
the semi gourmet flan is going to start the bidding at $4 .
nick?
yeah .
l think i have an idea .
yeah?
yeah .
like a really big idea .
really?
when you got your idea , did you feel it immediately?
oh , yeah .
right away .
you got one of those?
like one of my ideas?
i think so .
what is it?
yes !
hey .
hey !
stop the auction !
you just cannot eat flan and drive at the same time .
look , i've got flan all over me .
can't somebody come up with a better idea? !
we have .
that's right !
be one of the millions enjoying the taste sensation sweeping the nation .
nick's talking about pocket flan !
pocket flan !
no spoon , no mess !
that's right .
three simple steps , folks .
just flip it !
flip it !
squeeze it !
squeeze it !
mmm .
and enjoy .
enjoy !
wait a second , tim .
what was that name again?
pocket flan !
lsn't that just fantastic?
no , nick , it's not fantastic .
it's flan tastic .
yeah , but , tim , nick , i have a question .
how about us who are lactose intolerant?
we've got a new soy based pocket flan .
lt's flan in a tube .
lt's a little bit of happiness in a tube .
let's say i'm jogging .
l'm getting tired , i need a pick me up .
what am i going to do , get a candy bar?
lmagine if you're jogging with some of this stuff .
what's going on?
it's not going to work .
here's the other thing .
that's good .
i want to get down there where it's brown and super sugary .
where do you ...?
i can't ...
ln here we've mixed it up .
you've got all that .
it's pre mixed .
the brown is always part of it .
even if you don't see it .
ln the tour de france , they're going 20 miles a day , going up mountains .
what do you think they pull out of their spandex bikini bottom
to squeeze into their mouth when they want to eat?
pocket flan !
and here's another question .
i got to get some ...
i'm going to get some cornflakes .
i don't have time for cornflakes .
i do have time for flan .
that's right .
i'd love to see this ...
this has been vacuum tested
to a depth of 200 feet if you're scuba diving .
just the other day i see this kid walking down the street .
he has the pocket flan .
right?
right .
he squeezes it ... he's on a skateboard .
he squeezes it ...
lt arcs up .
he goes like ... and ...
that's like a new skateboard trick .
who here likes to drive?
you guys like to drive?
yeah .
who here likes to drive race cars?
anybody?
all right .
l'm captain speedway ,
and nothing tastes better at 200 miles per hour than pocket flan .
firemen .
i got to go save someone .
maybe i need a little extra something .
where am i gonna put my hose?
i can't hold the hose and this thing .
" where's the hose go?
i put a hose under my arm and then i fight the fire .
this is on a serious note .
recently we received a letter from a woman , gladys , who ...
well , pocket flan saved her life .
all right .
she was a backpacker .
she was stuck out in the woods ...
and , by god , pocket flan ...
l can't think of it .
l wanted to say some tearful thing , but i couldn't think of a thing .
