no one will know .
we'll know .
3200 , 3500 , 3800 , 4000 . . . . . . 42 , 45 , 4800 !
we can disappear .
we can raise some money .
sell everything and just leave the country .
senorita?
mexico .
why not?
we can get a little house on the beach .
take a different name .
people do it all the time .
what will we tell charlie?
tell him it's an adventure .
we could fish all day .
we could learn to play the guitar .
i would serenade you to sleep every night .
we'll just live the rest of our lives on that beach .
and then when we die , we can just push out to sea .
what do you think?
sounds perfect .
