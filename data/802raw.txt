if you wait and forget ... ... you can do it all over again !
it's wonderful .
clever .
thank you .
for mrs. van daan .
oh , i feel terrible .
i don't have a thing for anybody .
it's hair shampoo .
i took all the bits of soap and mixed them with the last of my toilet water .
oh , thank you , anneke !
she's got your number .
i wanted to write a poem for all of them , but i didn't have time .
yours , mr. van daan , is really something .
something you want more than anything .
cigarettes !
look at that !
cigarettes !
two of them .
father found some pipe tobacco in the pocket of his coat , and we made them .
rather , father did .
look at that .
light it !
go on , light it !
it's tobacco .
really , it is .
there's a little fluff in it , but not much .
ah , yes .
it works !
look at him !

thank you .
mr. van daan !
for mother .
a hannukah greeting .

whatever you say

t en hours of doing what you 're told?
anything you 're told?
that's right .
you wouldn't want to sell that , mrs. frank , would you?
never .
this is the most precious gift i've ever had .
for father .
annele , i wasn't supposed to have a present .
look at that .
it's a muffler .
oh , i know .
to wear around your neck like an ascot , you know .
i knitted it in the dark each night .
i'm afraid it looks better in the dark .
it's fine .
thank you , annele .
thank you .
lsn't it a dream?
lovely , isn't it?
thank you , anne .
for mouschi .
he'll like it .
and this is for you , yourself .
from miss quack quack .
go on , open it .
aren't you going to open it?
come on , show us what it is .
it's a safety razor .
what?
it's not new .
miep got it , secondhand .
but you really do need a razor now .
what for?
look at his upper lip .
see?
he wants to get rid of that?
put some milk on it and let the cat lick it off .
you think you're funny , don't you?
look , he can't wait .
he's going in to try it now .
i'm going to give mouschi his present .
mouschi , mouschi , mouschi .
enough !
and last , but never least , my roommate , mr. dussel .
something for me?
capsules .
they're earplugs .
to put in your ears so you won't hear me when i thrash around at night .
i made them myself .
try them .
see if you can hear me .
watch him .
wait , i'll put

thank you .
that's a real hannukah .
lsn't she cute?
a real hannukah .
now let's sing the song , father .
wait till you hear the hannukah song , mr. dussel .
annele .
i'm afraid we shouldn't sing the song .
it's a song of jubilation and of rejoicing .
one is apt to become too enthusiastic about it .
please , let's sing it .
i promise not to shout .
very well , but quietly , annie .
i'll keep my eye on you .
if you get
oh .
oh !
i told you not to come in with that cat .
get out of here !
what's the matter with you?
haven't you any sense?
get that cat out of here .
cat?
you heard me , get it out of here !
i have no cat .
mr. dussel .
it doesn't have to be the cat .
just the hairs on his clothing ... ... from the cat is enough when he comes in the room .
you won't be bothered anymore .
we're getting rid of it .
at last , you listen to me .
and i'm not doing it for you .
that's all in your mind , all of it .
i'm doing it because i'm sick of seeing that cat eat all our food .
that's not true .
i only give him scraps .
don't tell me .
he gets fatter every day .
damn cat looks better than any of us .
out he goes tonight .
no !
mr. van daan , you can't do that .
that's peter's cat .
peter loves that cat .
annie .
if he goes , i go .
go .
go .
he's not going and the cat's not going .
what's wrong with you?
it's hannukah .
look , please , annie , sing .
annele .
annele .
i think we should first blow out the candles .
then we'll have something for tomorrow night .
father , you're supposed to let it burn itself out .
i'm sure that god understands shortages .
praised be thou , lord , who has permitted us ... ... to celebrate this joyous festival .
amen .
amen .
amen .
i think they've gone .
they've found us .
if they had , they would be up here by now .
i know it was the green police .
they've gone to get help .
maybe the gestapo looking for papers .
or another thief looking for money .
i'm going down .
they may still be there .
annele , this is saturday .
we won't know what happened until miep or mr. kraler come here on monday .
we cannot live with this uncertainty .
now , please .
please .
get our money .
they say you can buy them off .
quick , go get the money .
keep still !
you want to be dragged off to a concentration camp?
you gonna stand there till they come get you?
will you keep still?
someone go and make father come back .
haven't you done enough?
please , mr. van daan .
annie !
i lift up mine eyes unto the mountains , from whence cometh my help .
my help cometh from the lord , who made heaven and earth .
he that keepeth thee will not slumber .
he that keepeth lsrael doth neither slumber nor sleep .
the lord is thy keeper .
the lord is thy shade upon thy right hand .
over here .
i better go and look and make sure .
yeah .
the lord shall keep thee from all evil .
he shall keep thy soul .
hear me , o , lsrael .
the lord shall guide thy going out and thy coming in .
took the typewriter and ran away .
he didn't shut the street door .
it was swinging wide open .
the watchman was passing .
we had a burglar .
he got out as he heard me coming .
i will lock the door and report it .
they've gone and locked the door .
oh , thank god , they've gone .
i'd just as soon they take us than to continue with this agony .
i can't think .
it's all right .
the danger has passed .
who says the danger has passed?
don't you realize that we're in greater danger than ever?
please , will you keep still?
thanks to this clumsy fool , someone now knows we're up here .
someone knows we're hiding .
it's a thief !
you think ... ... he'll go to the green police and say , " i was robbing a place ... ... and i heard a noise above my head "?
would he do that?
i think he will .
you're crazy .
i think that someday that the thief will be caught ... ... and he'll make a bargain with the gestapo .
he'll say to the gestapo , " lf you let me off ... ... i'll show you where some jews are hiding .
that's what i think .
oh .
he's right .
oh , mother , let's get out of here .
we can't stay here now .
please , let's go .
go?
where?
yes , where?
have we lost all faith?
all courage?
a few moments ago , we thought they had come for us , didn't we?
we thought it was the end .
well , it wasn't the end .
we're alive .
we're safe .
we thank thee , o , lord , our god , that in thy infinite mercy ... ... thou hast again seen fit to spare us .
amen .
amen .
annele .
the song .
how about the song?
happy hannukah .
happy hannukah .
saturday , the 1st of january , 1944 .
another new year has begun ... ... and we find ourselves still in our hiding place .
we have been here now ... ... for one year , five months and 25 days .
one of our family has left us .
mouschi ran away .
we 're all a little thinner .
the van daans 'discussions are as violent as ever .
mother still doesn 't understand me .
but then , i don 't understand her either .
there is one great change , however ... ... a change in myself .
i read somewhere that girls of my age don 't feel quite certain of themselves .
that they become quiet within ... ... and begin to think of the miracle that is taking place in their bodies .
i think that what is happening to me is so wonderful .
not only what can be seen ... ... but what is taking place inside .
each time it has happened , i feel i have a sweet secret ... ... and i long for the time when i shall feel that secret within me again .
annele !
peter !
a wonderful surprise , mr. kraler and miep are here .
thank you .
you shouldn't have come .
you should have at least one day to yourselves .
don't say that .
it's so wonderful to see them .
what is it?
what is it?
mr. kraler .
happy new year , mr. dussel .
happy new year .
how are you , margot?
feeling any better?
i'm all right .
we filled her full of every kind of pill ... ... so she won't cough and make a noise .
look what miep has brought us .
a cake !
ooh .
a cake .
well .
i'll get some plates .
thank you , miep .
thank you .
you must have used all of your sugar rations for weeks .
it's beautiful , isn't it?
it's ages since i've even seen a cake .
not since you brought the one last year .
remember?
it had " peace in 1 943 " written on it .
peace in 1 944 .
peace has to come sometime , you know .
here you are , liefje .
now ...
... how many of us are there?
none for me .
oh , you must .
please , miep .
good .
that leaves one , two , three ....
seven of us .
eight .
the same as it always is .
i left margot out .
i take it for granted margot won't eat .
why wouldn't she?
i think it won't harm her .
all right , all right .
i just didn't want her to start coughing again , that's all .
and please , mrs. frank should cut the cake .
what do you mean?
well , mrs. frank divides things better .
just what are you trying to say?
forget it , we're wasting time .
don't i always give everybody exactly the same?
don't l?
forget it .
no , i want an answer .
don't l?
yes , yes , yes .
everybody gets exactly the same ... ... except mr. van daan gets a little bit more .
that's a lie !
she always cuts the same
mr. van daan , please .
you see , miep , what a little sugar cake does to us?
it goes right to our heads .
here you are , mrs. frank .
thank you .
you're sure you won't have any?
very sure .
miep .
no , thank you , really .
cut the cake .
thank you .
that's yours , peter .
maybe mouschi went back to our house .
you ever get over there?
do you think that you could?
i'm afraid with him gone a week , peter ....
make up your mind .
already someone has had a big nice meal from that cat .
it's delicious , miep .
delicious .
well , i must run .
there's a party tonight .
how heavenly !
remember what everyone's wearing ... ... and what you eat and everything so you can tell us .
i'll give you a full report .
goodbye , everyone .
goodbye , miep .
just a minute .
there's something i'd like you to do for me .
where are you going?
what are you going to do?
no .
don't you dare take that coat .
what is wrong?
father is going to sell her fur coat .
she's crazy about that old fur coat .
it's mine , you hear me?
my father gave me that coat .
no !
you have no right !
is it possible that anyone can ... ... be silly enough to worry about a fur coat at a time like this?
it's none of your darn business .
peter .
just ... ... a little discussion on the advisability of selling this coat .
as i have often reminded mrs. van daan ... ... it's selfish of her to keep it when people outside ... ... are in desperate need of clothing .
so if you please , sell it for us?
it should fetch a good price .
and by the way ... ... would you get me cigarettes?
i don't care what kind , get all you can .
it is very difficult to get them , mr. van daan , but i'll try .
goodbye .
goodbye .
mr. frank , could i talk to you?
something's happened , hasn't it , mr. kraler?
what's happened?
if it is something that concerns us here , we'd better all hear it .
the children  what they'd imagine ... ... would be worse than any reality .
it is a man in the storeroom .
his name is karl .
you knew him .
one day , he came to the office .
what do you hear from your friend mr. frank?
i said there's a rumor you were in switzerland .
he said he had heard that rumor too , but he thought i knew something more .
i did not pay much attention .
i tried to forget it .
and then yesterday , we were coming out of the storeroom , out there .
i had started down to the office .
i looked back .
he was standing , staring at the bookcase .
he said , " i thought i remembered a door up here .
was not there a door here leading to the loft?
then he asked me for more money .
20 guilders more a week .
blackmail .
20 guilders?
very modest blackmail .
that's just the beginning .
you know what i think?
he's the thief who was down there that night .
that's how he knows we're here .
how was it left?
what did you tell him?
i told him i had to think about it .
what shall i do , pay him the money?
take a chance on firing him , or what?
i do not know .
for heaven sakes , don't fire him .
pay him what he asks .
keep him here , where you can keep your eye on him .
is it much that he's asking?
what are they paying nowadays?
he could get it in a war plant .
but this is not a war plant .
mind you , i do not know if he knows or not .
offer him half , then we'll soon know if it is blackmail or not .
and if it is?
we've got to pay , haven't we?
whatever he asks , we've got to pay .
let us decide when the time comes .
this may be all my imagination .
you get to a point , these days ... ... where you suspect everyone and everything .
what does that mean , the telephone ringing on a holiday?
that's my wife .
i told her i had to go over some papers in my office ... ... to call me here when she got out of church .
goodbye .
happy new year .
goodbye .
goodbye , mr. kraler .
i will offer him half , then .
thank you , mr. kraler .
you can thank your son for this .
him and his damn cat !
that night , there .
i tell you , it's just a question of time now .
sometimes i wish the end would come , whatever it is .
margot !
at least we'd know where we were .
you should be ashamed of yourself , talking that way .
think how lucky we are .
think of the thousands dying in the war every day .
think of the people in concentration camps .
what's the good of that?
what's the good of thinking of misery when you're already miserable?
that's stupid !
we're young , margot and peter and l .
you grownups have had your chance .
but look at us .
if we begin thinking of all the horror in the world , we're lost .
we're trying to hold on to some kind of ideals when everything
ideals , hope , everything is being destroyed .
it isn't our fault the world is in such a mess .
we weren't around when this started .
you listen to me !
so don't try to take it out on us !
she talks as if we started the war .
did we start the war?
you left this .
thanks .
i thought you were fine just now .
you know how to talk to them .
i can't think when i'm mad .
i say too much .
i hurt people's feelings .
i think you're just fine .
thank you , peter .
dussel , what he said about mouschi , about somebody eating him ... ... all i could think is i wanted to hit him .
that's what i used to do at school .
but here a fight starts , i duck in my room .
you're lucky , having a room to go to .
his lordship is always in mine .
when they start in on me , i have to stand and take it .
you gave some of it back to them just now .
i get so mad .
they've formed their opinions ... ... about everything .
but we're still trying to find out .
we have problems here that no other people our age have ever had .
and just as you think you've solved them ... ... something comes along and bang !
you have to start all over again .
i think your father's fine .
oh , he is , peter .
he is .
he's the only one who's ever given me the feeling that i have any sense .
isn't it funny , you and l?
here we've been together all this time ... ... and this is the first time we've ever really talked .
it helps a lot to have someone to talk to , doesn't it?
it helps you let off steam .
anytime that you want to let off steam ... ... you can come into my room .
i can get up an awful lot of steam .
it's all right with me .
do you mean that?
i said it , didn't l?
good night .
good night .
good night .
may i come in?
no , i'm not dressed yet .
margot .
tell me , am i terribly ugly?
oh , stop fishing .
no , tell me .
of course you're not .
you've got nice eyes ... ... and a lot of animation and ....
may i come in?
come in , mother .
mr. dussel is impatient to get in .
he takes the room all day .
you're not going in again tonight to see peter?
that is my intention .
aren't you afraid you're disturbing him?
mother , i have some intuition .
then may i ask this much , annie?
don't shut the door when you go in .
you sound like mrs. van daan .
no , no .
i don't mean to suggest anything is wrong .
i only wish you wouldn't expose yourself to criticism .
i'm sorry , mother .
i'm going to peter's room .
i'm not going to let petronella van daan spoil our friendship .
just a moment , mr. dussel .
in my day , the boys called on the girls .
you know how young people are .
peter's room ...
... is the only place where they can talk .
talk?
that's not what they called it when i was a girl .
i'm sorry , margot , that you have to be the one left out .
i feel so guilty about you .
why?
i mean , every time i go into peter's room ... ... i have the feeling that i'm hurting you .
i know if it were me , i'd be desperately jealous .
i am jealous , a little , but not of you and peter .
i'm ....
i'm only feeling sorry that i haven't anyone ... ... with whom to discuss my feelings .
margot , i won't even  listen , you've found a companionship ... ... and i want you to enjoy it .
only , in my heart , i feel i've got a right to share feelings with someone too .
but i'm sure that peter , that that boy , he could never be that person for me .
maybe there's nothing to be jealous about .
maybe i'm just taking the place of his cat .
will you please let me in my room?
just a minute , dear mr. dussel .
well , here i go , to run the gauntlet .
thank you so much .
look at her .
a lot of good it did me to have a son .
i never see him .
just a minute , dear .
i'd like to say a few words to my son .
do you mind?
peter , i do not want you staying up till all hours tonight .
you need sleep .
you're a growing boy .
annie won't stay late .
she's going to bed promptly at 9 .
aren't you , annie?
yes , mother .
may we go now?
listen for the chimes , dear .
aren't they impossible?
treating us as if we're still in the nursery .
don't let it bother you .
it doesn't bother me .
i suppose you can't really blame them .
they think back to what they were like at our age .
they don't realize how much more advanced we are .
already i know what i want to do , don't you?
i want to be a journalist or something .
i love to write .
what do you want to do?
i know what i'd like right now .
i'd like to go to england and get with the free dutch forces .
peter , you wouldn't try a thing like that .
you'd never make it .
i'd make it .
only a few of the hundreds that try do .
i know , but i'd like to get in it and hit back .
to just sit here , it's not for me .
you like margot , don't you?
right from the start , you liked her .
liked her better than me .
i don't know .
it's all right .
everyone feels that way .
margot's so good .
she's sweet and bright and beautiful , and i'm not .
i wouldn't say that .
oh , no , i'm not .
i know that .
i know quite well that i'm not a beauty .
i never have been and never shall be .
i don't agree at all .
i think you're pretty .
that's not true .
and another thing .
you've changed .
from the first , i mean .
i have?
i used to think that you were awful noisy .
and what do you think now , peter?
how have i changed?
well ... ... you're quieter .
i'm glad you don't just hate me .
i never said that .
i bet when you get out of here , you'll never think of me again .
that's crazy .
now , what did i ever see in that miss quack quack?
i haven't got any friends .
peter , of course you have .
everyone has friends .
not me .
i don't want any .
i get along fine without them .
does that mean you can get along without me too?
i think of myself as your friend .
no .
if they were all like you ... ... it'd be different .
peter ... ... did you ever kiss a girl?
yes .
once .
was she pretty?
the girl you kissed?
i don't know .
i was blindfolded .
it was at a party .
one of those kissing games .
i don't suppose that really counts , does it?
it didn't with me .
i've been kissed twice .
once , a man i'd never seen before kissed me on the cheek ... ... when he picked me up off the ice .
i was crying .
and the other was a friend of father's who kissed my hand .
you wouldn't say those counted , would you?
i wouldn't say so .
i know , almost for certain , margot would never kiss anyone ... ... unless she was engaged to them .
and i'm sure , too , that mother never touched a man before father .
but i don't know .
things are so different now .
what do you think?
do you think a girl shouldn't kiss anyone except if she's engaged or something?
it's so hard to try to think what to do .
here we are with the whole world falling around our ears ... ... and you think ... ... well , you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow .
what do you think?
i suppose it depends on the girl .
with some , no matter what they do , it's wrong .
but others ... ... it wouldn't necessarily be wrong with them .
i always thought that
i think i should go now .
that's right .
good night .
you won't let them stop you from coming?
no .
i might bring my diary .
there are so many things in it i want to talk over with you .
there's a lot about you .
what kind of things?
well ... ... i wouldn't want you to see some of it .
i thought you were nothing .
just the way you thought about me .
did you change your mind?
i changed my mind about you .
you'll see .
good night , annele .
good night , anne .
good night .
mm hmm .
outside , there's a quiet excitement .
invasion fever is mounting from day to day .
and people talk nothing else but the hope of liberation .
it had best come soon .
we here have had bad news .
the people from whom miep got our ration cards have been arrested .
mr. kraler is in the hospital .
it seems he has ulcers .
i'm afraid we are his ulcers .
miep has to run the business and us too .
how very fortunate we are , when you think of what is happening outside .
i feel that spring is coming .
i feel it in my whole body and soul .
i'm utterly confused .
i'm longing ... ... so longing for everything .
otto !
otto , quick !
he's stealing the food !
mr. van daan has been stealing !
what is it?
mr. van daan !
let me !
what happened?
mr. van daan .
look , the bread !
dirty thief !
you good for nothing !
mr. dussel !
help me , peter !
let him go .
peter , help me !
let him go .
let him go !
putti , what is it?
he was stealing the bread !
it was you .
and all the time we thought it was the rats .
mr. van daan , how could you?
i'm hungry .
we're all of us hungry .
i see the children getting thinner and thinner .
your own son , i've heard him moan in his sleep , he's so hungry .
and you come down in the night and steal food that should go to the children !
he needs more food than the rest of us .
he's used to more .
he's a big man .
and you !
you're worse than he is !
you're a mother !
and yet you sacrifice your son to this man !
this
edith .
don't think i haven't seen you .
always saving the choicest bits for him .
i've watched you day after day , and i've held my tongue .
but not any longer .
not after this !
now , i want him to go .
i want him to get out of here !
edith .
get out of here?
what do you mean?
just that .
take your things and get out !
you're speaking in anger .
you can't mean it .
i mean exactly that .
for two years , we have lived here side by side .
we've respected each other's rights .
we have managed to live in peace .
are we now going to throw it all away?
mr. van daan , i know this is never going to happen again , is it?
no , no .
he steals once , he'll steal again .
i want them to leave .
you go now !
mother ... ... you're not putting peter out .
peter hasn't done anything .
i don't mean peter .
peter can stay .
i have to go if he goes .
he's my father .
he's no father to you , that man .
he doesn't know what it is to be a father !
i wouldn't feel right .
i couldn't stay .
very well , then .
peter .
no .
mrs. frank , you would put us out on the street?
you can find another hiding place .
where would we even find a cellar?
a closet?
mr. frank ...
... you told putti ... ... you would never forget what he did for you when you first came to holland .
that you'd never be able to repay
if my husband had any obligations to you , he has paid it .
edith , i don't know you .
i've never seen you like this .
i should have spoken out long ago .
you can't be nice to some people .
there would be plenty if you hadn't come .
no , mrs. van daan .
please !
we don't need the nazis to destroy us .
we're destroying ourselves .

our beloved queen spoke .
she used words like " soon " ... ... " when i am back , " " speedy liberation .

i may be back in school by fall .
wednesday , the 2nd of july , 1944 .
the invasion seems temporarily bogged down .
mr. kraler is back in the hospital .
he has to have an operation .
it seems d day was too much for him .
thank you .
ha , ha .
the joke is on us .
miep says the warehouse man doesn 't know a thing ... ... and we 're paying him all that money .
our dear vegetable man is on his way to a concentration camp .
he was picked up today for hiding two jews in his house .
there's not much .
it was mr. hauk , our greengrocer , they arrested .
the other news is , the gestapo have found our typewriter that was stolen .
no !
they'll trace it back and back until it gets to us .
you watch , you !
everyone is low .
even father can 't raise their spirits .
i have often been downcast myself , but never in despair .
i can shake off everything if i write , but ... ... and that is the great question , will i ever be able to write well?
i want to so much .
i want to go on living even after my death .
there it goes again .
mr. frank , do you hear?
yes , i hear .
this is the third time .
third time in quick successions .
it's a signal .
i tell you , it's miep , trying to get us .
for some reason , she can't get to us .
she's trying to warn us of something .
please , mr. dussel .
please .
you're wasting your breath .
something's happened , mr. frank .
it's been three days now that miep hasn't been to see us .
and today , not a man has come to work .
there hasn't been a sound in the building .
perhaps it's sunday .
we may have lost track of the days .
you with the diary there , what day is it?
i don't lose track of the days .
i know exactly what day it is .
it's friday , the 4th of august .
it's friday and not a man at work .
i tell you , mr. kraler's dead .
that's the only explanation .
he's dead .
they've closed down the building , and miep's trying to tell us .
she'd never telephone us .
please , i beg of you , answer the phone .
no .
just pick it up and listen .
you don't have to speak .
just listen and see if it's miep .
for god's sake , answer the telephone !
i've told you , no .
i'll do nothing that might let anyone know that we're in this building .
mr. frank's right .
no need to tell us what side you're on .
lf we wait here quietly and patiently ... ... i believe that help will come .
mr. dussel .
mr. dussel .
mr. dussel !
too late .
so we just wait here ...
... until we die .
i can't stand it .
i'll kill myself .
for heaven's sake , stop it !
i think you would be glad if i did .
you want me to die .
whose fault is it we're here?
we could've been safe in america or switzerland .
but no , no .
you wouldn't leave when i wanted to .
you couldn't leave your precious things .
your furniture !
that's right , blame it all on me .
it's all my fault .
your hats , shoes , dishes !
i never had anything i really wanted .
everything was for your pleasure !
look , peter .
look at the sky .
aren't the clouds beautiful?
what a lovely , lovely day .
you know what i do ... ... when i think i can't stand another minute of being cooped up?
i think myself outside .
i think i'm on a walk in the park where i used to go with father ... ... where crocus and jonquils and the violets grow along the slopes .
you know ... ... the most wonderful part of thinking yourself outside?
you can have it any way you like .
you can have roses and violets and tulips all blooming in the same season .
isn't that wonderful?
when i was outside , i used to take it all for granted .
and now in here , i've just gone crazy about nature .
i've just gone crazy .
i think if something doesn't happen soon ... ... if we don't get out of here ... ... i can't stand much more of this .
i wish you had a religion , peter .
no , thanks .
not me .
i don't mean you have to be orthodox ... ... or believe in heaven and hell and purgatory and things .
i just mean some religion .
it doesn't matter what .
just to believe in something .
when i think of all that's out there ... ... trees and flowers ... ... and those sea gulls ....
when i think of the dearness of you , peter ...
... and the goodness of the people we know ... ... mr. kraler and miep , the vegetable man ... ... all of them risking their lives for us every day ... ... when i think of these good things , i'm not afraid anymore .
i find myself .
and god , and l  that's fine .
but ....
when i begin to think ... ... i get mad .
look at us .
hiding out here for two years .
not able to move .
caught like
waiting for them to come and get us .
we're not the only people that have had to suffer .
there have always been people that have had to .
sometimes one race , sometimes another .
and yet  that doesn't make me feel any better .
i know it's terrible , trying to have any faith ... ... when people are doing such horrible ....
but you know what i sometimes think?
i think the world may be going through a phase ... ... the way i was with mother .
it'll pass .
maybe not for hundreds of years ... ... but someday .
i still believe ... ... in spite of everything ... ... that people are really good at heart .
i wanna see something now .
not a thousand years from now .
but , peter ... ... if you'd only look at it as part of a great pattern ... ... that we're just a little minute in life .
listen to us .
going at each other like a couple of stupid grownups .
look at the sky .
isn't it lovely?
someday , when we get outside again ... ... i'm going to
open !
open !
open !
open !
for the past two years , we have lived in fear .
now we can live in hope .
and so it seems our stay here is over .
they've given us just a moment to get our things .
we can each take a bag and whatever it will hold of clothing .
nothing else .
so , dear diary ... ... that means i must leave you behind .
goodbye for a while .
p. s. , please , please , anyone ... ... if you should find this diary , will you please keep it safe for me?
because someday i hope that
no more .
i had gone to the country to try to find food .
when i got back , the police were in the building .
we made it our business to learn how they knew .
it was the thief who told them .
we knew the thief .
he was
it seems strange to me now .
but we were all full of hope in the camp here in holland , where they first took us .
the news of the war was good .
the allies were sweeping through france .
we felt sure they would get to us in time to
but ....
in september , we were shipped to poland .
men to one camp , women to another .
from there , they were sent to belsen .
i stayed in auschwitz .
in january , we were freed , the few of us who were left .
the war was not yet over , no .
t ook us a long time to get home .
each time the train would stop ... ... we'd all get out at a siding or a crossing ... ... and walk from group to group .
where were you?
were you at belsen?
at buchenwald?
at mauthausen?
where?
ls it possible that you ever knew my wife?
did you ever see my husband?
my son?
my daughter?
that's how i found out about my wife's death .
margot's .
van daans '.
peter .
dussel .
but ... ... anne ....
i still hoped ....
yesterday , i was in rotterdam .
i met a woman there .
she'd been in belsen with anne .
i know now .
in spite of everything ... ... i still believe that people are really good at heart .
she puts me to shame .
