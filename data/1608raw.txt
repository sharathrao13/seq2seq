popular resistance to a series of unpopular dictators was growing in nicaragua for over 50 years .
by the spring of 1 979 , nicaraguans from all walks of life joined together in a final attempt to overthrow president anastasio " tacho " somoza .

you tuna sucking piece of raw meat , get your ass over here .
move over .
sit down here .
how you doin '?
good .
good to see you .
what the hell you going to zambeze for?
i thought i'd get some great shots of your head being blown to smithereens .
smithereens !
thought you were with the government .
i am .
this is the government .
these are the rebels .
the fuck they are .
this is a government convoy to calunda .
this is the abou deian revolutionary front .
you're shittin 'me .
they'd be pissed off if they knew .
this is the dumbest motherfucker i ever signed up for , man .
it don't even pay shit .
nicaragua .
that's the spot .
cheap shrimp , lotta rays .
it's real thin in the spook department too .
you dig me?
price , i don't what you're doin ', but you'd better get your ass down here .
come on , man .
you're gonna get ripped to shit .
oates , what the hell is this?
the us government offers that house to any cuban pilot flying migs for the rebels who chooses to defect to america with a russian jet .
but that's bullshit .
we know that , but they don't .
they figure the cubies will go for that pool , so they don't let them near the jets .
the rebels can't fly migs .
pricey , that's the point .
they destroy their own air force .
it's an old scam , but it's guaran fuckin 'teed .
who is this?
cla?
yeah .
the smartest guys in the world .
i guess we found out where the government is .
you can walk to work from here .
what a break .
i guess i'll get goin '.
take care .
be careful .
i love africa .
so this strange war grinds into its seventh year .
from ndjamena , chad , this is claire sheridan .
no , no , you didn't hear any music .
it must be the connection .
ok .
yes .
goodbye .
alex , don't play that goddamn thing when i'm filing .
we're late .
it's my party .
we'll be late .
you called it a strange war .
lf you filed that story with me , i would say you were editorialising .
well , i like to editorialise .
are you drunk?
drunk?
only with the memory of making love to you on the plains of fianga , with the first liberation army marching by , and opening fire .
we freed the proletariat?
and we freed ...
i'm going to the party without you .
i don't wanna go to this party .
i'm bad at false modesty .
you're great at it .
you're right , i am .
alex , you're gonna make a great anchorman in new york .
undoubtedly i could win an emmy as a hostess , but i'm not going with you .
you could operate out of new york .
we could buy a place , burn our suitcases .
i still like suitcases .
i'm tired of memorising the president of the republic of maldives .
you tired of third world wars?
no , i'm tired of third world elevators .
look ...
wait .
don't leave me .
i have to , alex .
fuck abou deia and new york .
i'm goin 'to nicaragua with you .
no !
it's a neat little war and a nice hotel .
hey !
alex !
alex !
come on !
yeah !
all right , i want you to know this is the man that hired me for my first job .
and fired you from your first job .
and then hired me for my second job .
and fired you !
some of you may be asking yourself " what am i doing in this strange war?
another chapter in an endless struggle that's grinding into its seventh year .
but who of us can forget the giant struggle on the plains of fianga?
the give and take , the lunging , the parrying for position , the jockeying around , knowing full well ...
thank you very much .
look at this .
* you beside me here beneath the blue
* my dream of love is coming true
* within our desert caravan

well , you know ...
i mean ...
jeez , you look great .
thanks .

this is for alex .
that's lovely , but it's not the best thing you could give him right now .
why not?
we just split up .
who split up from who this time?
this time?
this time i'm the villain .
i thought it would be cleaner with me in central america and him in new york .
did he shout about burning your suitcases?
yeah .
well ...
i don't own any suitcases .
there's nothing to burn .
this is a great shot .
yes , it is .

hey , russel .
how are you?
hey !
ah ...
welcome to managua .
did you have anything to do with that?
well , i thought of calling your photographs " the pictures of a lost war " .
the new york editors loved it , since they didn't know where chad was .
it kinda legitimised their ignorance .
you got your cover , i got a feature .
a class struggle in three little words .
nifty , huh?
nifty , i say .
i'm russel price .
this is lsela cruz .
she works at the hotel , also as a translator .

you guys have a few problems down here , between the " poets " ... and the government?
problems?
down here it's called a war .
it started in 1 930 , before you were born ...
excuse me .
my spanish is not good .
what did he say?
he said he considers it an honour to be able to photograph our war .
he's got a real way with words .
i can tell .
you're a hell of a translator .
i know .
i'm much in demand around here .
will you excuse me?
lf you have any questions , just ask .
who's rafael?
depends on who you ask .
rafael .
comandante rafael .
he is either a marxist dupe of russia and cuba or the most popular leader of a democratic revolution .
take your pick .
hell of a face .
would he like to be photographed?
you would never find him .
wanna bet?
you would lose .
he's never been photographed .
congratulations on your elephants .
oh , thank you .
so far , alex , this war has the hell beat out of africa .
you're gonna have a ball .
alex !
hands off , ok?
i need a translator much more than you do right now .
aren't you hangin 'in there with claire?
i'm hangin 'in there , like an interim post war government waiting for the palace to be overrun by younger men .
younger men?
yeah , russel .
you know , i still only have one major weakness .
oh , only one?
yeah .
i hold onto things too long .
i'm too loyal .
ok , alex , listen .
jody borrowed 100 rials from me in tehran .
i owe 40 bucks to dick , and he'll pay me in lire for a future in pesos .
good rate .
but you gotta pay eddie in dollars , so i can square it with chuck .
we got it all worked out cash .

no cordobas .
but i'll go double or nothing with you on the whole pile .

before you fall in love , that's marcel jazy , friend of wine , women , and somoza .
yeah , i know .
he's also a businessman in search of a business , who doesn't try to cover up his connection to washington .
i like his connection in nicaragua tonight .
but look at those moves .

shut up !
come with us .
we won't hurt you .
we'll trade you for some nicaraguans who care about their country .
come on .
let's go .
hold on .
alex , it's charlie from new york .
he says a nightclub bombing isn't big enough to hold for the world section .
there were bits of body in the piano and the song was " moonlight in vermont " .
what's he got better than that?
he's got the pope in egypt .
terrific .
forget the pope .
you got the pope someplace every week .
there's a big story down here , because it's the first sign of fighting in managua .
get a map , charlie .
look up nicaragua .
you drive to new orleans and then you turn left .
oh , like hell i'm editorialising .
look , it happened in a room full of press and cla .
how do i know they were cla?
because they wore name tags .
what do you think?
we're backing a fascist government .
i know that's not news , but see if you can find an angle , huh?
alex , there's fascist and there's fascist .
let's not use words like that , ok?
no , we don't have any pictures of rafael , because nobody knows where he is .
anybody crazy enough to go and look for him is gonna get his nuts shot off .
same to you , charlie .
what do you want?
we've met , alex .
hub kittle , from lewitsky and knupp , new york , public relations .
i have a client down here .
who's your client?
president somoza .
yeah , i know , i know , but there's an untold story here .
the man has a point of view too , right?
right .
you're , uh ...
price , right?
russel?
i need to know whether russian or cuban made guns were brought in .
lf the guerillas had help , the war would have ended long ago .
well , that's fine , but we need proof .
claire !
it's your daughter from los angeles .
hello .
hello , darling .
how are you?
has your grandmother spoiled you silly by now?
she has?
great .
yes , i got the letter with the picture of your dress .
you don't think it's cut a little too low?
you don't , huh?
well , i do .
gringo .
you're under arrest .
i'm a journalist .
periodista .

periodista .
wake up , priest , son of a whore .
cigarrillo?
s .
you're a priest , huh?

what are you doing here?
the government accused me of knowing rafael .
governments are always wrong , huh?

periodista .
i'd like to find rafael myself .
whose side are you on?
i don't take sides , i take pictures .
no side?
go home .
esprate aqu .

mr price .
it was all a misunderstanding .

i'm sorry .

your visitation papers , mr price .
you were not arrested .
you just came to visit , in case your embassy asks .
you want your passport back , yes?
you ok?
i'm fine .
how'd you know where to find me?
where else?
what happened?
oh , i was just visiting .
jazy was there .
i think he had me released .
jazy?
think there's a story?
i don't know .
but i can start looking .
looking for what?
i'm gonna find rafael .
now , russel , we have to be clever with jazy .
don't worry .
i won't come right out and ask him if he's a spy or not .
are you a spy or aren't you?
spy is such a nonword , mr price .
nobody is a spy any more .
russel prefers pictures to words .
you don't have to apologise .
you are journalists .
and you're a businessman?
a businessman ...
that sounds good .
ok , i'm a businessman .
why was i arrested and then released?
who the hell are you?
no water?
no , no water .
marcel , you told me there'd be water in the pool this week .
lf she dove in , i assure you she would not notice .
my darling , the guerillas destroyed the pumping station in masaya .
we must ration water for now .
maybe i should go back to panama?
maybe you should .
please .
con permiso .
you were arrested because the guardia are clowns who specialise in excess .
you were released because i told them to release you .
thank you .
those aren't the normal duties of a businessman .
but they are the normal duties of a spy .
you win , i am a spy .
there , are you happy?
i feel better .
now we can relax .
you can turn off your little thing .
oh , i trust you won't say anything to hurt me .
why would we wanna do that?
ln some ways , i am a terrible spy .
i used to be much better at it , but now it seems everyone knows who i am .
i have too many girlfriends .
i like to be photographed .
i talk too much .
i always talk too much .
but my girlfriends like that .
no matter .
marcel?
do you know who she is?
no .
that's miss panama .
do you know who that is?
yes , i do .
she's in love with me .
i've got to get some water in the pool .
and once a week i have lunch with president somoza to discuss security measures against the sandinista insurgents , and all he wants to talk about is miss panama .
he is worried about her .
he thinks she's seeing another man?
he assigned me to find out who he is .
thank you .
we all know the revolutionaries are going to win .
don't we?
you know , i saw this picture on a leaflet in africa .
you know what they all say about it?
that you're the genius that created that idea .
it was a lot of people's idea .
have you been to len?
no .
no , we're going to masaya .
we understand the rebels have entered the cuartel .
you would love len .
a nice cathedral .
beautiful light .
we're not doing a travelogue .
of course , of course .
only i have heard that comandante rafael was recently in the area .
rafael's near len?
well , it's a rumour .
what do i know?
marcel , estoy desamparada .
she's lonely .
well , we don't want to keep you .
it's my job .
do you think i talk too much?
so rafael's near len .
did you dream about miss panama last night?
no .
i dreamed about you .
did you have a good time?
yeah .
so did you .
ls that an old war injury flaring up?
ls that tape recorder on?
absolutely .
i was sunning myself on the uss pueblo when the north koreans attacked .
i took a bullet in the chest .
but i was lucky .
i had a roll of ektachrome in my pocket here over my heart ...
and the bullet ricocheted over the film and grazed your cheek ...
saved my life .
you heard about it , huh?
do you ever dream about me?
yeah , once .

but dennis martinez , he is the best .
he's from nicaragua .
he pitches major leagues .
i'd like to find rafael .
he was here , but he's gone .
he's going to matagalpa , no?
you control a baseball better than your words .
rafael cannot be found .
you understand , compaeros?
what's rafael doing in matagalpa?
just keep your talk to baseball .
you see dennis martinez , you tell him that my curve ball is better , that i have a good scroogie .
i like sandinistas .
and i like baltimore orioles .
you bastard !
what are we gonna do about him?
he's dead .
you can't believe everything you hear in the news .
i think about you all the time .
i'll try and get back before you graduate .
i love you very , very much .
i'll finish this up back at the hotel , honey .
bye bye now .
i know who shot pedro .
somebody in the bell tower .
why didn't you tell the guerillas?
because i knew they'd kill him .
and i didn't wanna interfere .
it wasn't an easy choice .
i think i made the wrong one .
do you know that you didn't shoot any pictures after that whole thing was over?
i didn't , did l?
oh , jesus , i picked up the gun .
ls something happening to us?
yeah , i think so .
yeah , i know .
how was matagalpa?
no bang bang , alex .
none at all .
did you find anything?
yeah .
half the press corps .
hello?
claire .
hey !
alex .
how you doing?
how was len?
bloody .
claire , i'm tired of nicaragua .
you haven't been here very long .
yeah .
long enough .
long enough .
you're right .
everybody's right .
about what?
my cheekbones .
what do you think of 'em?
i like your cheekbones , alex .
ls there anything the matter?
it's a face made for television .
you mean you decided to go with the network?
yeah .
they're gonna give me ten grand a week to read the news .
i'm gonna be in 60 million homes every night .
when i take a breath , all of america will do so .
when my voice trembles , all of america will tremble .
i'm gonna be a star .
my voice will be more important than who controls congress .
you'll become a household name .
i'll become a household name .
i should never have come down here .
i'm sorry , alex .
i think it's a lot better this way .
it's all right .
don't worry about me .
i'm speaking in song titles .
but promise me one thing .
i'll promise you anything .
no farewell parties .
i don't wanna make a speech to anyone .
russel?
russel who?
him too .
a va bien?
comment a va?
you're running late , mr president .
we can schedule this for another time .
nonsense .
let them wait .
we are a stunning couple , huh?
my stomach is like a rock .
i've been working out .
yes , we are a stunning couple .
mr president , you own one fifth of the land in nicaragua .
you own the port , the airlines , the mercedes dealership ...
ls it a crime to be a car dealer?
let me show you something .
it's said that the guardia operates a torture chamber at coyotepe .
this is a portrait of my father .
he was very special to me .
every sunday morning i drive out to the cemetery and put flowers on his grave .
i think people should know that .
would you comment on the fall of len to the rebels?
listen , russel .
let's grow up , huh?
it's easy to fall in love with the underdog , but there's an upside and a downside to this thing .
i just wanna remind you all this stuff about a " revolution of poets " is crap .
it's great pr though , isn't it , hub?
so what's the upside?
simple , and it could happen .
somoza destroys the insurgents , rebuilds the country , shitcans the purveyors of excess , stabilises the cordoba , and is finally beloved as the saviour of nicaragua .
our pal .
you got a smoke?
yeah .
what's the downside?
commies take over the world .
seor kittle .
excuse me , russel , but the war may be over .
this is a democracy , and i have been freely elected by my people .
there were more votes than voters ...
presidente !
no me ven que estoy ocupado con esta seorita?
vyase de aqu .
i am sorry .
i have to conclude this encounter .
something happened .
i have many more questions , mr president ...
did he tell you about his parents and the graveyard?
yes , i know about that , but i'd like to ...
good , good .
i'll just make sure everything's set up .
s , rpido .
my friends , this gathering was not supposed to be a press conference as much as a get together .
but i've just been handed a piece of news .
rafael is dead .
he has been killed in an ambush near matagalpa .
mr president !
how many people killed?
sorry , my friends .
no questions , please .
a press release is being prepared .
call washington .
what do you think?
tacho makes that speech about every six months .
maybe he got lucky .
hub , is this for real?
yeah , sure .
russel , excuse me , but miss panama would like her picture taken with tacho .
ln colour?
ok .
a little embarrassing , huh?
seor presidente .
listo , listo .
that'll be fine right there .
how in the hell could tacho find rafael?
russel , please .
i have my hands full .
that's fine right there .
ls tacho lying again?
they did kill him , didn't they?
what do i know?
tacho needs a victory very badly .
he needs to prove to jimmy carter that he is still winning .
the death of rafael is the proof he needs .
carter doesn't need proof .
he just sent 25 million in new arms to tacho .
no , no .
he didn't .
the state department is getting nervous about what is going on down here .
en el sol , por favor .
pardon my french , but whose fucking side are you on?
i work for everybody .
that's a great job .
i send messages to jimmy and i tell him that the revolution is a flood which cannot be stopped , but it can be controlled .
nobody listens to me .
i can't even get a little water in my pool .
would you switch sides , please?
for just one more .
that's very nice , very nice .
thank you .
i think rafael is alive .
i'm gonna find him .
thank you very much .
matagalpa northern provlnce
there's the guy we're lookin 'for .
terrific .
go one more block .
oh , shit !
i'm not gonna die in matagalpa .
