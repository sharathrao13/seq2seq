but something is going on
so what are you going to do?
i need to meet someone
no wait a second here where's my dissertation?
my dissertation my paper
sir .
professor
my paper
i believe you
after we stopped last time
i felt a spiritual presence here
but i couldn't get near the other dead woman before .
she's inside?
lf so , it's a sign
when we die , the soul separates
lf the soul becomes lost and wanders we don't know what can happen
so then it's not the person's fault right?
i think so .
but how do we know?
we never really know
can you help us?
i can't
what do you mean?
you're our only hope
you're not the one who has to see them
it's so frightening
you're right .
it's not easy to deal with
i just hope nothing happens
but if something does k
what do i do by myself?
you fool !
where are you now?
why is this open?
sir , headquarters what happened?
what's going on?
i don't know
let's go talk it over
are you ok , so hee?
could you take me inside?
i'm sorry so hee
i'll be ok
i'll get you some medicine
at the time when the train crashed i wasn't scared at all
i think it's cuz mom was holding me so tight
we should have died with her don't you think?
life is like a train ride
our final destination is death
the first car gets there to and so does the last car eventually
forget about it , hee joo
we waited so long for today
i love you
why can't i see?
train crashed .
250 people dead
bereaved family members cry over the death of loved ones
why was enginemam oh jong hyun in the control room?
train wreck cleared , trains run again
departure times brought forward from 12 to 11 : 50
do you remember what so hee said to us?
how she felt a strange sensation
when the train stopped until we took off again
we stalled for 10 minutes right?
we're almost at the next station
maybe the ghost train
and we merged at that time
you asked about jin sook
we were seeing each other
that night we had a stupid argument
that was the last time i saw her
when she was taken hostage
i don't want to think about it
after tonight , this train will be put to rest
we have to stop the train now .
so hee's disappeared
mi sun !
we're almost there .
calm down you're not thinking straight
you're bringing these visions by deluding yourself
yeah
i wish i was making this up
i really do
so hee , are you ok?
please open your eyes
please !!
mi sun
are you ok?
what happened?
the spirit
has taken her over
i'm afraid of what she'll do
a good child doesn't steal
lf you do , you'll get spanked
don't be scared
you boarded this train because of your dad
send them back
let them go to a warmer place
how
why do you have this?
why'd you do it?
do what?
why'd you kill her?
don't be afraid

she told me that the ocean breathes
the ocean's not an animal , how does it breathe
no , it's true .
the ocean breathes
