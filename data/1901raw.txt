as a teacher of children ... ... and a fencing instructor ... ... it's impossible for me to go begging for money here in morioka .
but i know full well ... ... that without money none of you will live through the winter .
kaichiro ...
mitsu ...
though i might ...
... abandon my clan to earn my living ... ... i will never abandon you .
shizu ... ... look after the new baby when it comes .
kanichiro ...
no !
it has to seem like i left without telling you .
we can't have words of farewell !
so ... ... i'm going .
kanichiro !
father !
father !
father ...
go home !
you mustn't see me off !
i won't .
only just ... hold mitsu one last time .
she doesn't deserve to have the father she loves ... ... go without a word .
papa ...
papa ...
papa ...
mitsu ...
mitsu ...
papa ...
mitsu ...
father , please don't cry .
i only wish your departure were a happier one .
squire saito returns !
saito sensei?
why?
i don't know .
squire saito !
stand aside !
i was tired of hiding out .
i went back to the shinsengumi ... ... though i knew perfectly well how bedraggled it had become .
that was all the more reason for me to return .
my sympathies for the unpleasant task that fell to you .
i don't need your sympathy .
move .
saito sensei ...
miss nui ...
what about her?
she killed herself .
i see .
i took the liberty of arranging a funeral at koenji temple .
mind your own business .
right then only he knew ... ... my innermost thoughts .
you're going to kill me?
a country samurai who doesn't care what happens?
doesn't anything matter as long as you get paid?
money grubber !
mercenary !
how much are they paying you to kill me? !
i'm truly sorry .
it was all ... ... downhill from there .
the shogun resigned , and political power returned to the emperor .
the lord of aizu , commissioner of kyoto ... ... was relieved of his post , leaving us with nothing to guard .
okita was dying of tuberculosis ... ... and shinohara , of the ito faction , had shot kondo .
as if seeking its last stand , the shinsengumi joined in the fight ... ... against the southwestern clans .
fighting was all we could do .
squire ono ...
straighten your backs !
stick out your chests !
we are the warriors of mibu !
shinsengumi !
good on you !
shinsengumi !
are you properly dressed?
if your clothing isn't good and tight , you will die !
even if you fall , do not drop your sword !
keep swinging it !
if you're out of breath , grab your opponent .
use any means you can ... ... and come back alive .
they're coming !
the shinsengumi's here !
charge !
fire !
forward !
fire !
it was ludicrous .
swords against guns , a foregone conclusion .
the day of the sword ... ... was already far in the past .
nanbu clan godown , osaka
reporting !
the shogun's forces are retreating .
the southwestern army ... ... is in pursuit .
they're winning?
yes , sir .
the shinsengumi's no help?
'shinsengumi '?
nothing .
we fled with the shogun's troops .
the other clans deserted us .
on the edge of annihilation , we played our final card .
you all right?
have some food .
go on , eat .
eat slowly !
saito sensei ...
i got the aizu people to share their supplies with us .
please ...
have you eaten?
uh ... ... no .
was that the last?
why didn't you say? !
you let me eat the last one !
i'm used to being hungry .
this'll do me fine .
you bastard !
i hate your guts !
why should one shit sack care if another's full? !
in a world where men hate enough to kill each other ... ... why are you trying to fill my stomach? !
saito sensei !
i can't breathe !
yoshimura ... get out of here .
we're going to die here ... ... whether we like it or not .
but i don't want you to .
not a man like you .
mr. saito ...
i am ... ... a nanbu samurai .
a nanbu samurai ... ... lets neither wife nor child sway him from his duty .
when nanbu fights , i will be there first .
i'm truly grateful for the consideration you've shown me ... ... but i will never turn my back on my duty .
yoshimura !
saito sensei ... ... my humble thanks .
he was a true samurai .
the enemy !
we're under attack !
hold your fire !
stop shooting !
swords !
fight or die !
cut them down !
retreat !
retreat !
retreat !
forward !
the emperor's standard !
we are the imperial army !
withdraw your soldiers !
there will be no mercy for rebels !
are we rebels now? !
withdraw !
withdraw !!
don't resist !
don't resist !
withdraw !
hijikata sensei !
are we rebels?
hey !
stand your ground !
stay here , i said !
i am kanichiro yoshimura of the shinsengumi !
i serve the tokugawa shogun !
i do not wish to raise my arm against his majesty the emperor ... ... but my duty bids me fight !
i stand against you !
yoshimura !
don't die !
yoshimura !
yoshimura !
don't die .
yoshimura !
yoshimura !
yoshimura !
yoshimura !
yoshimura ...
so you knew yoshimura sensei ...
i assume he died at the battle of toba fushimi ...
no .
what , is he alive? !
after that battle ... ... the war went in favor of the southwestern clans .
my father , jiroemon ono ... ... had been sent to osaka ... ... as godown manager , to steer the clan through the crisis .
leave to speak !
his lordship the shogun ... ... has fled osaka castle , left his army and taken ship for edo .
we know who's going to win now .
the way forward is clear !
we can either join the emperor and his southwestern clans ... ... or be destroyed with the tokugawas !
i agree !
calm down ... ... or the lower castes will get excited as well .
it is important that we remain absolutely neutral .
we must not take sides .
all we need do is dress normally and strengthen our gate .
we aid no fleeing soldiers ... ... and we say nothing about the war's outcome .
understood?
yoshimura sensei picked that time to appear before my father .
kanichiro? !
yoshimura's here? !
he's in front of the gate , badly wounded .
yoshimura !
what should we do?
all right , bring him into the back garden .
yes , sir !
why did he have to come now? !
why? !
you bloody fool !
you should be ashamed .
yoshimura !
squire jiroemon ...
while our battle has ended ... ... in total defeat ... ... to die here at the hands of some villain ... ... would be a wasted death .
if i may , i would like to be of service to my own land .
i would like to return there .
now?
a true nanbu samurai ... ... would go back to the shinsengumi and die there like a man .
i beg you !
yoshimura ... ... after what you've done ... ... i couldn't possibly ask the clan to take you back !
at least ... ... until my wounds heal .
for the sake ... ... of all our years of friendship .
to all the men of all the clans !
report all rebel soldiers ... ... to the imperial army !
conceal them ... ... and your clan will be suppressed !
i say again ...
report all rebel soldiers ... ... to the imperial army !
conceal them and your clan will be suppressed !
yoshimura ... ... you're a disgrace .
we will leave you alone .
kill yourself .
this is not an entertainment !
begone !
i'm sorry , sasuke .
kanichiro ... ... why did you fight at toba fushimi?
why didn't you join the shogun at osaka castle?
together , you might have had a chance .
the way you are now , how could you escape anywhere?
it was ... ... out of duty i fought .
we lost , it's true ... ... but i'm not dead yet .
while i'm still alive ... ... i want to go back to morioka .
i want to see shizu ... ... and my children .
nanbu is my land .
i can't put you on the scales against all of nanbu .
if it were only me , i would die for you .
but i can't make nanbu the enemy of his majesty just for you .
that sword of yours won't cut any more .
i'll give you mine .
it's made by yamato no kami yasusada .
use it to cut open your stomach like a samurai should .
please help him !
father !
sir?
a hungry man can't meet death properly .
i'll give him some food .
i didn't realize .
i'm sorry .
i'll do it .
i didn't think about it until just now .
take him some hot water as well .
is it snowing ... ... in nanbu now . too?
powder snow ...
oh , dear ...
now what?
here .
this rice ...
... comes from nanbu ...
nanbu rice ...
it's so good ...
so good i drool to think of it .
enjoy it .
take your time and enjoy it .
thank you .
first ...
... one ryo .
a kimono sash for shizu .
this one ryo ... ... is for mitsu's doll festival stand .
this one's for keijiro's baby robe .
well , what do you know?
here i wanted to buy kaichiro a sword ... ... but i don't have the money .
kaichiro ...
... nothing could make you cry , could it .
i didn't ... ... deserve a son like you .
kaichiro and mitsu ... ... and keijiro , who i've never seen ...
i want to ... ... hold you .
shizu ... ... what are you doing right now?
can you hear the words my heart speaks ...
... that i never could say?
i fell ... ... completely in love with you .
i tried ... ... as hard as i could .
i did all i could .
you ...
... don't mind , do you?
shizu?
it's all right if i ... ... kill myself?
forgive me .
'let's go to the peach tree .
'lf there are any peaches , we'll pick them .
'five for uncle ... '
i can hear mitsu singing ... such a sweet little voice ...
mitsu ... ... you were never out of my mind ... ... even for a single day .
it's as if ... ... you're the only one ... ... i wasn't apart from for even a minute .
so mitsu ... ... even though i kill myself ... ... i'll always be by your side .
now i'm going to die .
shizu ...
kaichiro ...
mitsu ...
keijiro ...
i'm not going to hell , or to heaven .
i'm ...
... going to be with you ...
... every second ...
... with you !
i was there when yoshimura sensei died .
sir ...
take these two things ... " " ... to my home . '
he didn't use the sword !
you didn't touch the rice ... ... you stubborn mule !
kanichiro !
kanichiro !
eat !
eat !
it's nanbu rice .
from morioka , grown with kitakami river water .
eat !
kanichiro ... ... because of you ... ... shizu and the children eat their fill .
it's your turn now .
you dreamed of nanbu rice .
eat , kanichiro !
it's good !
kanichiro !
kanichiro !
he was named one of lord tokugawa's advance guard ... ... and served well .
rather than suffer dishonor ... ... he asked to commit hara kiri .
that was his choice?
yes .
he refused a second ... ... and bravely , alone ... ... cut open his stomach .
with that sword?
no .
he wanted to give it to you .
he didn't want it stained .
he used another .
i see ...
husband ... ... thank you .
you worked so hard ... ... to support us .
thank you .
so that's what happened ...
ordering him to do that must have broken your father's heart .
suddenly , after that ... ... my father was like a different man .
they must never become the imperial army !
the southwestern clans started this war .
they are the rebels !
he had always been so cautious ... ... but when akita went over to the southwestern clans ... ... he led the attack on it .
i call on the samurai of nanbu to do their duty !
i can only think ... ... that he was looking for death in battle himself .
and , sadly , he found it .
may all be well with you .
squire chiaki !
kaichiro ...
i'm going to hakodate to fight .
at the fort there?
yes .
you'll never come back alive out of there !
i don't care .
that's not very smart .
why go if you know you won't come back?
the duty of a nanbu samurai is to fight until the very last .
don't go !
don't go !
mitsu ... ... you can't stop him .
this is far enough , squire chiaki .
thank you .
this is pure spring water .
let's drink from it ... ... for luck .
drink from my hands .
now you drink from mine .
here .
i won't take it !
when everyone else is trying to stay alive ... ... you're going to die !
you're only 16 !
you haven't lived yet !
why do you have to die?
squire chiaki ... ... i can't leave the father i love to cross the river of death alone .
so please ... drink .
kaichiro ... ... don't die !
kaichiro !
chiaki ...
chiaki ...
chiaki !
kaichiro ... ... don't die !
don't die !
brother !
don't go away !
mitsu ...
i have to .
brother !
brother !
brother !
look after her , will you?
i will go and fight for nanbu .
brother !
brother !
brother !
kaichiro never came back to morioka .
he died in the battle of hakodate .
brother !
mitsu !
i'll be your big brother now .
and then , later on ... ... i married mitsu .
there !
all finished !
well done !
sorry to keep you .
minoru ...
i don't think it's serious .
just a cold .
i've mixed some medicine for his symptoms .
give it to him after meals , and see he gets lots of rest .
make sure you take this .
ok?
my humble thanks , yoshimura sensei .
well ...
thank you for your help .
take care .
come on .
morioka , in nanbu .
it's a beautiful place .
away to the south is mt hayachine ... ... with mt nansho and mt azumane to the west .
in the north are mt iwate and mt himekami .
out of the high mountains ...
grandpa , carry me !
no !
a samurai walks !
yes , sir .
ah , it's pretty as a picture !
there's nowhere like it in all japan !
may all be well with you .
mitsu has lost so many who are close ... ... that even now in sleep she holds my hand and won't let go .
words can't express how much of a help mitsu has been to me .
after my father died in battle ... ... my family were treated as rebels and suppressed .
but perhaps that was luck , as it made it possible for me ... ... to marry mitsu .
sasuke , who has become the boss of a gambling syndicate ... ... looks out for us even now .
mitsu and i have decided to move to china ... ... where we will practice medicine in manchuria .
we will cross the sea and live in that empty land ... ... and do the best we can there .
morioka , in nanbu .
it's pretty as a picture !
there's nowhere like it in all japan !
the morioka cherry blossom splits through rock to bloom .
the morioka magnolia blooms even facing north .
so i want you to run ahead of the times .
go wild .
bloom .
