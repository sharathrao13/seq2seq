23 . 976
since time began ... a war has been waged in the shadows ... between the armies of good and evil .
it may be fought on a grand scale ... or within the heart of a single individual ... or even a child .
the evil has taken many forms ... and used the darkest of arts .
in our time , they call themselves simply ... the hand .
the good follow the way ofkimagure .
its masters can see the future ... and perhaps even bring back the dead .
legend tells of a unique warrior ... a lost soul .
this warrior is a woman ... a motherless daughter .
and it is her destiny to tip the balance between good and evil .
she is a treasure , and both sides seek her out ... as a final weapon in an ancient war .
perimeter , what's your status?
delta team , clear .
alpha , clear .
bravo , secure .
it doesn't matter .
you can't stop her .
nobody can stop her .
her?
i was afraid if i told you , you wouldn't take the job .
i never should've hired you .
who do you think's coming for you?
you may have heard of her .
her name ... is elektra .
you find that funny?
she's an urban legend , sir .
that woman died years ago .
really?
well , then somebody must have brought her back from the dead .
you know , bauer , when you've done the things i've done ... you make a lot of enemies .
my private security detail ... the best money could buy .
this nonexistent woman killed 14 of them in half an hour .
i barely got away .
spent the next two days in monte carlo wondering why she let me go .
then she came for me .
i was under the protection of the hand itself , who sent their best .
although they seemed more interested in killing elektra than in protecting me .
she cut 'em down like wheat .
took maybe 10 , 15 minutes max .
didn't really think why i kept gettin 'away .
so here i am .
and now i understand her .
she wanted me to feel this ... what it's like to have nowhere to go ... nowhere to turn .
how's your perimeter doing now?
delta , what's your status?
there's no signal .
son of a bitch .
you know , the better the assassin ...
alpha , bravo , report ! the closer they can get to you before you know they're there .
alpha !
bravo !
report !
ah , christ .
they say elektra whispers in your ear before she kills you .
alpha . !
bravo . !
report . !
it's too late for your boss , bauer .
but you still have a chance .
jesus christ !
you can't fight a ghost , bauer .
here we are at last .
guess it's all true .
the red outfit and the knives and ...
so , what happens now?
you just kill me , straight out?
just cold?
don't worry .
death's not that bad .
yeah?
how do you know?
i died once .
so am i to understand that with all the power of the hand ... that the treasure continues to elude us?
yes .
perhaps if we had pursued it sooner ... and more aggressively ...
you dare to blame master roshi?
seems our methods are too mild for kirigi .
not at all , sensei .
but if we cannot have the weapon ourselves ... allow me to make sure it does not fall into the hands of those who may use it against us .
master , allow me .
things like this must be handled smoothly , quietly .
then work smoothly , meizumi , but quickly .
kirigi?
yes , father .
patience .
you think that's safe , leaving the door unlocked like that?
geez , elektra , you're gonna end up with a bullet in your head .
i brought you a little something .
no , stop , mccabe .
don't put it down .
i already cleaned there .
why do you always do this?
get rid of my d. n. a.
ah , d. n. a. , of course .
right .
silly of me .
listen , i just picked this up .
i know you like to look .
it's all there?
less my 10 % .
half to barbados?
and half to the bank on the isle of man .
you can do better in mutual funds .
i know a guy .
i could put you in touch ...
no , thanks .
or not .
but ...
look , i don't want to tell you how to do your thing ... but quite a body count on this one , e.
we were only getting paid for demarco .
was it necessary?
had to be done .
did it?
elektra .
did it?
okay .
anyway , it spreads the legend .
besides , they were gonna kill me .
of course they were .
absolutely .
and , speaking of which , as your agent ...
i am obligated to tell you we just got an absolutely fantastic new offer ...
but that last job ...
let's skip this one .
i need a breather .
great idea .
i'm just sayin 'it's a lot of coin .
i'm tired .
you're tired?
well , then you better get yourself some sleep ...
'cause you are gonna crash , baby , you know that .
i mean , you even get laid?
it's a lot of money , this new offer .
mccabe .
all right , fine .
you know what?
look , you want to take time off , take time off .
call me when you wanna work .
how much?
and just tell me .
two .
ah , they'll give it to somebody else .
they wouldn't pay that to somebody else .
you got that right .
they asked specifically for you .
location's in there .
i'll call you when i get the target .
get some sleep .
you might wanna reflect a bit .
again !
clear !
do you know the way , elektra?
kimagure , the ability to control time ... the future ... even life and death .
i know i'm the best student here .
not the best .
the most powerful .
you understand violence and pain .
but you do not know the way .
teach me then .
that's my point .
i can't teach you .
i want you to go .
is this a test , sensei?
no , not a test .
just go .
i don't have anywhere to go .
the client says he needs you there a couple days early ... says that's part of the deal .
why?
no idea .
he just wants you to wait .
i just want to get this over with .
hey , me too .
listen , why don't you tell me about the view?
i hear it's gorgeous out there .
you know , you got the ...
one , two , three , four , five .
come on , elektra .
keep pedaling .
five more minutes .
don't use your hands .
don't be lazy .
only use your feet .
let's go !
let's push , push , push , push !
nikolas .
honey , please .
she's just a kid .
keep going , elektra .
keep going .
jesus !
what's the matter with you?
you could have killed me !
what are you doing here?
nothing .
i'm friends with the wheelwrights .
damn it .
you cut my friggin'jacket .
how did you get in?
the front door was unlocked .
no , it wasn't .
yeah , it was .
look , the people who live here let me come in all the time .
ask anybody .
hmm .
it's broken .
so , who are you anyways?
my name's abby .
what'd you steal?
nothing .
what do you think i am?
ow !
please don't call the cops .
my dad will kill me .
in some parts of the world , they just cut your hands off .
whoa .
how did you do that?
get out of here .
mom?
oh , shit .
you know i can't sit still , mccabe .
call me with the name .
client says he needs you there a couple days early .
wants you to wait .
to have nowhere to go ...
death's not that bad . nowhere to turn .
he wants you to wait .
you just kill me , straight out?
he wants you to wait .
are you looking for me?
hi .
are you the new , uh , tenant?
eddie ferris , the realtor ... he said , uh , a young woman had taken it for the month .
what do you want?
sorry .
this is kind of awkward , but , uh ... have you seen a girl ... 13 year old , uh , blondish hair to about here?
my daughter , abby .
we had a fight yesterday ...
i saw her late afternoon .
oh , you did?
she broke into my house .
shit .
really?
uh , she knows the wheelwrights , who , uh ...
she , uh , didn't take anything , did she?
no .
good .
look , if she broke something , i'm ...
i'm happy to pay for it .
i'm mark miller .
we're in the little cabin two houses down .
okay , thanks .
hi , you've reached mccabe .
but please leave just your name .
do not leave a message .
mccabe ...
i'm sick of sitting here .
we don't get a name soon , i'm walking .
hey .
how long have you been standing there?
like , a minute .
what did you tell my dad?
did you tell him i broke into your house?
yeah , because you did break in .
well , you didn't have to tell him .
i thought you were cool .
i'm not .
yeah , no kidding .
now he's on my case .
he made me come ask you to have christmas dinner with us .
have what?
christmas?
dinner?
december 25?
did you know today's christmas?
thank you .
i can't .
i have something to do .
what?
everything's closed .
you're on an island .
come on .
please?
it's just the two of us every night ... and i'm bored out of my skull .
what are you doing?
nothing .
why?
were you counting?
no .
so , will you come?
please?
because if you don't , i'll just keep breaking into your house .
hmm?
hmm .
i have to change my clothes .
great !
i'm abby .
elektra .
elektra .
cool .
i told you not to leave the house .
you didn't even know i was gone .
abby .
chill , dad .
we have a guest .
i'm sorry .
she told me that you'd invited me .
i don't want to ...
i'll just ...
hmm .
uh uh .
no .
please , stay .
i'm ...
i'm glad you're here .
uh , can i get you a beer?
wine?
water .
her name's elektra , dad .
elektra .
like the tragedy .
your parents must have had a sense of humor .
not really .
so when she sees all the cute guys who like me ... just as friends , dad ... she accidentally spills poster paint all over my model of the taj mahal .
so i put glue on her shoes .
i got suspended for that , and then i got expelled for fighting .
but that was way back in the day in ... in , um ...
baltimore .
so , i was a little surprised to see you take the wheelwright place .
not many renters this time of year .
it's just for the month , for work .
what do you do anyway?
oh , layoffs , payroll reduction .
that sort of thing .
hmm .
sounds boring .
abby .
no , it is boring .
i like your bracelet , by the way .
do you know what those are?
here .
they're warrior beads .
they're from indonesia .
centuries ago , you had to be the best fighter in your village to earn them .
wow .
i bought 'em off ebay .
is there a school here on the island?
uh , we're trying homeschooling for a while .
i read at college level .
and i'm doing algebra one on my own .
she's a good student .
it's the , uh , behavioral stuff that's been a problem .
i have authority issues , and i don't take bullshit well .
don't speak in that ...
hey , abby !
it's okay .
suddenly i got a teenager on my hands .
she's hard on herself .
you can tell , huh?
most people think she's a slacker .
no , i shouldn't .
merry christmas?
where's her mother?
she died ... a couple of years ago .
back in baltimore?
yeah .
drunk driver .
my mother died when i was young .
i should go .
i have work .
come on , it's early .
thanks for dinner .
hmm .
what?
good morning .
you just got a delivery .
it's a double .
which makes double the money .
yeah , that's why the big bucks .
what's the matter?
nothing .
good .
then there'll be no problems .
i'll call you when it's done .
how's math going?
how do you think it's going?
what do you mean , you're not doing it?
not now or not ever?
too many variables .
not enough background .
background?
e , they'll just send somebody else .
the storm we've been waiting ... all ... finally here .
it's moved into the seattle tacoma area .
i'll get sandbags from the shed .
you know , this is such a joke .
they make it sound all exciting , but you know it's just rain .
if you're not too busy , young lady , feel free to tape the windows .
now !
mark . !
can i talk to you?
can we talk inside?
yeah , sure .
hey , what's up?
can you go to your bedroom for a minute , abby?
i need to talk to your dad .
now !
go , abby .
who are you?
don't lie to me .
what?
they won'tjust kill you .
they'll kill abby .
damn it . !
dad !
go !
run , abby !
bathroom !
go !
go !
go !
stay with abby !
okay .
elektra !
abby !
no !
ohh !
damn it .
get back !
get back !
go !
go .
there'll be more coming .
what's coming next will be worse .
i believe kirigi wishes to address the council of the hand .
venerable master ... despite your delicacy and subtlety ... you have failed to solve the problem of the treasure .
huh !
master roshi gave that task to me .
yes , exactly .
and my men are taking care of it .
your men are dead !
killed by the female , elektra , the gaijin .
bu ...
your forces are an abomination !
master roshi ... the hand cannot afford to lose the treasure for another generation .
so i humbly request you allow me this task .
perhaps with a little less delicacy ... my forces will not be defeated by a mere woman .
the task is yours .
complete it , and you will have proven yourself worthy ofleading this council .
i will step aside .
oh , that's just great .
the hand .
of all people .
so who's gonna help you out on this one , e?
stick?
just give me his location .
sure , no problem .
i got it handled .
goddamn it .
you're up , blind man .
double combo : triple carom on the four three two one six with a bank mass .
uh , you don't need to call all your shots , pops .
just the first one .
that is the first one .
whoa , whoa .
aw , you gotta be kidding me .
eight ball in the corner .
blind , my ass .
leave your money on the table .
here's a dollar , abs .
go play some pinball .
why do i always have to miss the good stuff?
just go .
elektra .
same walk .
same perfume .
they need your help .
over here .
this is mark miller .
mark and his daughter , abby , are being chased by the hand ... and they need your protection .
i'm leaving them with you .
the hand is your business , not mine .
and yet you saved their lives .
why?
what did you imagine would happen next?
i didn't really have time to think about it .
blind instinct .
then you and i are back where we started , elektra .
did you ever ask why the hand was after them?
they don't know .
really?
mr. miller doesn't know?
i do know .
the hand wanted something he couldn't give .
he tried to run .
and what?
they killed my wife , abby's mom .
there was no drunk driver .
i lied .
you're on your own .
why did you really save them , elektra?
some kind of penance?
a down payment on your sins?
has she told you what she actually does for a living , mr. miller?
she saved my life and my daughter's .
that's enough for me .
then you landed on the lucky side of the street .
damn , you son of a bitch !
because with most people ...
well , elektra ... you haven't changed .
what are we gonna do?
elektra?
what are we gonna do?
you gotta run .
as far as you can , as fast as you can .
south america .
africa .
change your name .
change your appearance .
you're not coming with us?
no .
i can't .
why not?
isn't that part of your code or something?
i don't have a code , abby .
how are we supposed to defend ourselves?
we'll be okay , abby .
no , we won't .
wake up , dad .
we won't . !
they're gonna hunt us down .
just like mom .
get in the car .
get in the car !
what's wrong?
she's down the street .
three blocks over in the parking lot .
we need to kill the gaijin assassin first .
should we go now?
not here .
keep track of them .
i'm a soccer mom .
so , you , um ... you really kill people for a living?
yeah .
why?
it's what i'm good at .
that's messed up .
yeah .
well , well , the reluctant assassin .
sorry to drag you into this , mccabe .
me too .
hi .
i'm abby .
hello , abby .
i'm wondering what you're doing here .
there's plenty of room in the house .
go ahead and help yourselves to whatever you need .
thank you .
you're welcome .
you want to pull the trigger , or should i do it?
oh , e.
you're crashin 'on me , baby .
i said you'd crash , and you are crashing .
i just want to get 'em someplace safe , give 'em a chance .
they're already dead , e.
they got no chance .
don't go down with them .
i'll need passports .
i'll need plane tickets .
sure .
throw in some season tickets to the lakers .
go .
i don't want you to tell her anything .
i hate lying .
why can't we tell her?
we don't know anything about her .
she saved us .
because she doesn't really know who you are .
if she knew ...
she's my friend .
your friend?
she's the only one i have .
and i do not want to die with ...
you're not gonna die !
don't you ever say that again ... ever .
okay?
yes .
elektra?
what's the matter?
is something wrong?
they told me to change my appearance , so ...
no , it's ...
you look great .
thanks .
can you show me how to use those things , the , uh , salad tongs?
sais .
sais .
they're not for you .
i want to learn how to defend myself .
they're offensive weapons .
they're for killing .
you use them .
i don't want you to be like me .
i do .
do you wanna learn something really , really difficult?
yeah .
what?
come on .
now sit down .
close your eyes .
what is this , yoga?
no , it's called kimagure .
kimagure .
it's more valuable than learning to use a weapon ... because it allows you to see what's gonna happen before it happens .
that's intense .
how do you do it?
concentrate .
meditate .
let go of yourself and see everything around you .
it's not easy .
how long did it take you to master?
i never actually finished my training .
i only know enough to keep myself alive .
but there are true masters like stick who can use kimagure to bring back the dead .
wow .
close your eyes and breathe .
just sit quietly .
shh !
how are you doing?
we're still alive .
thank you .
oh , don't thank me , mark .
please , you don't really know what i was doing .
what you were doing there?
sure i do .
you were there to kill us .
i knew it as soon as you took the wheelwright place .
i'm not a good person to get involved with .
i'm not asking for anything .
i'm sorry .
yeah , i hated that .
e , get back .
get back now . !
what happened?
that bird's been hanging around here since late yesterday .
they're here .
they're here .
let's use the truck .
we won't make it .
but that's the best way .
trust me .
there isn't time .
use the cellar .
there's a tunnel .
take you out past the orchard to the trees .
head north .
what about you?
shit .
let's go .
be careful .
keep 'em safe .
holy ...
don't tell me , the circus is in town , huh?
i'll tell you what .
you might as well kill me now , 'cause i ain't talking .
talking is not necessary .
but i accept the first half of your proposal .
they're in the woods .
typhoid , stone , tattoo .
get kinkou , head there now .
hurry .
hold up .
just follow me .
just keep running .
get in there .
mark , come on .
go .
go .
elektra .
elektra !
shh .
go !
run , abby !
run !
go !
why didn't you tell me?
elektra . !
abby , no !
let me go !
ah , you are the little treasure , aren't you?
the war is over .
the war has just begun .
move back , abby .
she is safe .
another day , old man .
you'll be fine .
rest now .
don't look for your opponent .
know where he is .
i'm blind , and i see more than any of you , because i don't look .
you had no right to drag me into this , stick .
this whole war with the hand , everything , it's all about her , isn't it?
they call her the treasure .
she was a prodigy from four or five years old .
word got around fast .
the hand wanted her for themselves .
they tried to steal her .
her father spirited her away .
and you set this up ... the contract , mccabe , all of this ... you hired me to kill them .
you're entitled to your opinion .
a father and his daughter , stick .
you manipulated me .
did i?
was all this a test?
everything from the day you threw me out , has it all been a test?
what if i had failed?
some lessons can't be taught , elektra .
they must be lived to be understood .
when you came here , you were filled with anger .
all the decency you once had , poisoned by violence and tragedy .
this is not the way .
this is not our way .
you talk in riddles , old man .
it keeps my students alert .
i always knew your heart was pure .
you simply needed to see it for yourself .
what about abby?
as long as kirigi is alive , she's only safe here .
she has no choice .
two , three , four , five .
one , two , three , four .
two , three , four .
one ...
still breaking and entering i see .
sorry .
you'll need it .
keep practicing .
i'm sorry i lied to you .
don't apologize .
you did what you needed to do .
i didn't wanna lie to you .
neither did my dad .
it made me sick not telling you .
everybody lies , abby .
nobody tells the truth about themselves .
including you .
especially me .
the layoffs and payroll reductions .
like that .
and the , uh , the counting .
sorry?
o. c. d.
i don't have o. c. d.
i had it when i was a kid , but i haven't done that in years .
you were just doing it .
when you walk slow like that .
what are you doing?
are you counting?
don't mock me .
i'm still your superior .
maybe .
wanna find out?
i'm gonna go find my dad .
don't force it .
you're forcing it .
you'll be better than i am very soon .
i'm just a kid .
i don't wanna stay here .
what do you want?
to finish it , you and me .
no help from stick , no help from your father .
winner take all .
and when i kill you , the little one is ours .
and when you don't , she is free forever .
agreed?
agreed .
we will meet where it all began .
and it will end where it all began .
for you , at least .
clever girl .
we meet again .
now you'll remember .
there's nothing you can do .
so the balance tips to me .
let her go . !
brave girl .
you taught her well .
but it's time for a new master .
is that what the blind man's been teaching you?
not good enough .
but you'll learn to anticipate your opponent .
abby ...
i'm not leaving you .
you're a pain in the ass .
just like you .
one , two , three .
tattoo , the treasure's here .
stay right behind me .
stay close , abby .
elektra !
nice trick .
i've seen it before .
abby , where are you?
elektra?
not exactly .
you know , i used to be the treasure ... and i don't like being replaced .
so let's keep your death between you and me .
abby !
enough .
it ends now .
i told you , there's nothing you can do .
you're slipping , elektra .
come on , let's go .
push , push , push .
let's go .
let's push , push , push , push . !
keep going , elektra .
keep going .
i'm just a kid .
i don't wanna stay here .
elektra .
don't worry , elektra .
i'll take good care ofher .
abby .
damn it .
come on .
abby .
abby , listen to me .
listen to me .
i always knew your heart was pure .
you simply needed to see it for yourself .
hey , warrior girl .
come here .
come here , abby .
i just found you .
hi .
thank you .
take good care of her .
sorry .
yeah , i hated that .
so , what's next?
kirigi's gone .
no one's after you .
back to school?
go to the beach and get a tan .
and get ice cream .
oh .
you gave me my life back .
you gave me mine .
will i see you again?
we'll find each other .
please don't let her be like me .
why not?
you didn't turn out so bad .
i don't want it to be so hard for her .
that's up to her .
anyway , your second life's never really like your first , is it?
sometimes ... it's even better .
