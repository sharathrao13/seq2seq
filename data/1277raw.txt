come here !
man , what were you thinking?
this was our thing .
you dragged jule into it .
why didn t you tell me sooner?
i don't know .
i just wanted to help .
we won't hurt you , ok?
you can trust me .
ok , drive .
got the flashlight?
go on !
be careful .
it's a 100 meter drop .
two people were killed last year .
put the groceries there .
we can sleep in here .
good .
a fire?
yeah , super .
the matches are up here .
your uncle comes here often?
hardly ever .
does he rent it out?
no .
we say we are on vacation .
in case the forest ranger comes by .
don't let hardenberg out .
good morning .
we'll make it .
i don't know how , but we'll get out of this .
how about a 70s style political kidnapping?
prisoner of the edukators
we tape it for the tv stations .
this is our chance , guys .
finally a living example to test our methods .
we need bread , milk and toilet paper .
and a newspaper .
a radio wouldn't be bad .
i'll go down and check the village .
i'll shop .
you guys cook .
someone have money?
not really .
hardenberg's buying first round .
how's the people's prison?
careful !
what are you expecting?
by reaching so few?
reach one , educate 100 "?
words get around .
we might get some copycats .
we are just the fuse .
you think you're so much better?
you're not better than terrorists .
you use the same methods ...
spreading fear and panic .
our goal isn't to be better at any price .
we think it's more original to have a cause ...
to make a difference
isn't that crazy?
we struggle like crazy to minimize your damage .
how ungrateful !
our little break ins are nothing .
compared to the violence used by people like you .
the state legitimizes you .
us ...
we get it from ourselves .
so you're germany's savior?
the new millennium's raf?
we're not hanging out in pubs talking about the great revolution .
but it's true ...
serious action makes you vulnerable .
how truly terrible !
peter , we never discussed it ...
how do you endure it all?
maybe because i'm not particularly cultivated .
or maybe because ...
i'm just a really cool guy .
what will you do with me?
you'll see soon .
we have 3 possibilities .
plan a , we make this a kidnapping and demand ransom money .
at least this shit will give us money for a new life .
we surely can't go back to the old one .
all in the past , jule .
plan b ...
we put him in the morgue .
are you crazy?
you've really lost it !
jule , i'm joking .
calm down .
i've had it with your dumb jokes .
this is about a human being !
ok !
bad joke .
i'll be serious .
plan b , we leave him here with food for a week .
then we inform the rangers .
but not before we're far away .
tea?
what do you earn per year?
more or less 200 000 .
3 . 4 million .
that's what i read in tagesspiegel .
sounds like more , not less .
don't you feel guilty?
ruining a girl's life for a car worth petty cash to you .
why?
alright .
i should have paid more attention to who was involved .
i was stressed out .
i'm sorry .
how many hours a day do you work?
13 , 14 hours , easily .
what do you do with all that money?
you amass things .
big , expensive things .
fat cars , enormous villa , a yacht ...
i'm an alpha male " .
i can't see any other reason .
you don't even have time to cruise on your yacht .
so why do you always want more?
we live in a democracy .
i don't have to justify why i own certain things .
i paid for them .
wrong !
we live in a capitalist dictatorship .
you stole everything you possess .
i can afford more because i work more .
i had the right ideas at the right time .
besides ...
i'm not the only one .
everyone get the same chances .
a real contender , aren't you?
in southeast asia , many people work 13 , 14 hours per day .
but they don't have villas .
they earn 30 euros per month .
they might have good ideas , too .
but they can't even pay for a bus ticket to the next town .
sorry i wasn't born in southeast asia .
but you can still help make life bearable there .
the first world could cancel the third world's debts .
that's only 0 . 01 % of the gnp !
that would collapse the world's financial system .
you want them poor !
it's the way to control them .
make them sell their raw goods . at dirt cheap prices ...
what do you know?
like you didn't cancel jule's debt .
that's absurd !
no .
it's the basic rule of the system .
suck others dry ...
it stops them from reacting .
that's not true .
sure , things need improvement ...
environmental protection , raising producer prices ...
but the system won't change .
why not?
yes , why not?
the nature of man is to want to be better than others .
in every group , a leader emerges quickly .
plus , most people are happy only when buying something new .
happy?
think they are happy , hardenberg?
look around .
get out of that company car ...
walk on the street !
anyone look happy?
or more like scared animals?
look into their living rooms .
all glued to the tv ...
listening to chick zombies ... speaking of a happiness long gone .
drive around town .
you'll see all the filth , the overcrowding ...
the masses in department stores ...
up and down , like robots on escalators .
nobody knows anybody .
they think happiness is an inch away .
but it's unreachable , because you stole it .
that's how it is .
you know perfectly well .
but i have news for you , executive ...
the system is overheated .
we're just forerunners .
your time is almost over .
swim in you shit technology , but others are full of rage .
the rage of children living in slums , watching american action films .
that's one part .
let's see ...
mental illness is rising .
serial killers , shattered souls , senseless violence ...
you can't sedate them with game shows and shopping .
the antidepressants won't work forever either .
the people have had enough of you shit system .
i admit some of what you say is true .
but i'm the wrong scapegoat .
i play the game , but i didn t make up the rules .
it s not who invented the gun , but who pulls the trigger .
i'll be in the kitchen ...
washing dishes .
you know , it's not that simple .
you don't get off that easily .
it's an island in the mediterranean .
practically no guards .
it's the control center for europe s 13 main satellites .
if the transmitter is sabotaged , every tv screen in europe will go black .
there's a fairly simple way .
i came up with it myself .
it's easier than you think .
can i have a toke?
i thought people like you hated dope heads .
people like me?
yeah , people like you .
you think i was born this way?
you probably weren't loved enough as a child .
i don't agree with you what you re doing , but your arguments ...
they remind me of another time .
give us a history lesson !
well , we did make history .
68 was a wild time .
i looked different then .
long curly hair ... old leather jacket , bell bottom pants ...
always a cap ...
a true rebel .
must have been long ago !
turbulent times ...
i was one of the leaders of the sds .
rudi dutschke was a good friend of mine .
who was chairman?
k. d. wolf , karl dietrich wolf .
number 2?
his brother , frank wolf .
this morning was a far cry for revolt .
yeah ... it's been a while ...
30 years ago .
we would have liked to get hold of a big shot like me .
and today , here i am !
pretty funny .
i don't want to kiss up to you .
and i don't think it's right what you're doing to me .
but your idealism ...
i can respect that .
morning .
everything ok?
yes , fine .
pass me the jam , please .
this one .
can i have some bread?
it's in my interest that things go problem free .
so i have a suggestion .
i must make a call before 16 : 00
our cleaning woman mustn't go in the house .
or she'll see the window .
there's no network .
and cell phones can be traced .
i'll drive him down to the village .
there's a phone booth .
he'll run away .
if he tries , i'll shoot him in the leg .
that won't be necessary .
i won't run away .
i won't scream for help .
i don't have a secret code with the maid , in case of kidnapping .
and i have to call my wife .
if not , she'll make a fuss .
peter , can we talk?
what's that about?
just a gas pistol i bought .
it's not loaded and it's broken .
it looks like real to a cop .
jule called in the middle of the night .
so i brought it with me .
it sounded like an emergency .
we could forget all that business about the accident .
i could draw up a document to end it .
i don't think this phone thing is going to work .
us three with a 50 year old ...
forget it .
the streets are dead at noon .
ok?
and if he screams?
he won't . not with my gun in his side .
we have no choice ...
the maid can't go inside .
there's not just the whole in the window .
come on .
but give me the gun .
i'll do it .
i didn't bother with it because i'm always on the move .
i gave it to my lawyer .
it was business as usual for him .
nobody knew to what extent it would affect someone .
you think i'm the weakest link here?
think i'll buy all your bullshit?
but this is about more than the damn accident !
where are the keys?
check in my jacket .
don't do anything stupid .
it's mr. hardenberg ...
hello mrs. rose .
yes , thank you .
no need to come today .
i came home earlier to work in peace .
i have some business to finish .
please come next wednesday .
i'll call you on tuesday .
good , same to you .
thank you .
bye .
now my wife?
yes .
it's me .
i had ...
hold on ...
a water pipe burst last night .
it was a big mess .
i had to call a plumber .
no ... everything is fine now .
but i couldn't call before .
yes , on monday .
at least , i hope on monday ...
i'll call you .
kisses from me .
bye .
good ...
you're a good liar .
it's a sauna in there .
bad cell phone reception .
yeah , my son is in withdrawal .
alright , let's go .
you heard ...
drive .
i guess it s been a while ...
since you did your own wash .
how can someone with your past live the way you do?
you must have had ideals .
under 30 and not liberal , no heart .
over 30 and still liberal , no brain .
yeah , right .
but i don't believe that crap .
it's the standard excuse of guys like you .
it happened slowly , gradually . you hardly notice it .
one day , you abandon your old car .
you want a dependable car , with air conditioning , a warranty .
you get married , raise a family , buy a house ...
the kids need a good education .
that costs money ...
security !
you create endless debts , so you need a career to pay them .
so you do like they do .
then one day , to your surprise at the polls ...
you vote conservative .
who made this great pasta?
me ..
respect .
thanks .
who cooks at your house?
your wife?
mrs. schwarz .
our cook .
before , i used to love to cook .
for my wife and i , the others in the commune .
like big parties .
how many where you?
we were 6 .
rolf , bernard , i ,
lizzy , gabi , my wife .
first , rolf and gabi were together .
then , bernd and gabi , then lizzy and me .
then bernd and lizzy ...
then lizzy and my wife for a while ...
it wasn't just a political movement .
we had fun .
free love ...
but i don't have to tell you three .
you skip .
skip again .
i'll draw 2 .
funny .
i pass .
i don't care .
you make the rules .
yes , i do .
when i was little ... with my friends ... we played house with dolls ...
it was so real for them .
they were so into it .
i was never able to forget they were only dolls .
i always felt like ...
more of a watcher than a player .
you know?
i still feel like that .
in real life .
it's the matrix .
if you see it , you can't be living in it .
neither can i.
good morning .
someone has to grocery shop .
we're out of coffee , wine ...
no more food , no more toilet paper ...
i can't anymore .
it's your turn .
i'll go .
i'll go with you .
there's no more dope !
ask in the store !
hardi , how about a game of cards?
awesome .
let's go in .
it's cold .
i thought ... money would bring freedom .
on the contrary .
you're burdened with responsibility .
sometimes i feel like i'm in jail .
stop moaning .
isn't 3 million a year enough compensation?
i don't know what to do with the money .
give it to those who need it .
with your annual salary you could save 1000 persons from starvation .
sounds corny , but it's true .
i could do that .
but only once .
so do it !
to be honest , peter ...
i've thought of giving it all up .
just sell everything , move to the countryside ...
live modestly with my wife , both of us work as teachers ..
like when we were students .
poor but happy .
we were in love .
when you talked about free love , why mention the three of us?
don't know it?
you bought them anyway !
they are disgusting .
they are for hardenberg .
you two got something going?
have you lost it?
kiss my ass !
this is your shit .
i'm out of here .
peter , i m sorry !
sorry for what?
it just happened .
i fell in love .
good , then i can go .
you don't love me anymore .
you bastard !
what were you thinking , man?
we hit it off , sorry .
hit it off?
just like that?
not " just like that " .
we got to know each other .
i thought we were friends .
we are friends .
i trusted you !
you told me to help her !
help her , not fuck her .
asshole !
coffee?
no , thanks .
can i help you?
no , forget it .
i'm going to lie down .
i'm a little tired .
the keys !
we screwed up .
kidnapping hardenberg was wrong .
we did it to save our own asses , not the world .
i guess this is it .
thanks for driving me home .
don't worry about the cops .
wait !
your sweater .
here .
this is for you .
waiver of debt .
i won't ruin your life .
what's wrong?
nothing .
after what i did , i can't make demands .
it s over .
talk like that , and you're one of them .
it's not the jule thing that hurt .
it s that you take me for an idiot .
if i pocket a rolex , that's not an insult to our case .
i believe in it , man .
us three ...
that's more important than stuffy bourgeois ethics .
the best ideas survive .
come on .
some people never change .
