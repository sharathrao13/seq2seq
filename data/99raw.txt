you couldn't hide , johnny !
nobody hides from us !

i think i broke my goddamn hand .

fuck you !
just do me !
sure , johnny .
but first ... ... mr. canelli wants a little souvenir .
open up !
open up !
we'll send this to your witness protection buddies .
see if it sings on its own .
they can take it to the trial .
open up , johnny !!
open up !!
benny?
who in the hell are you?
close your eyes .
who are you?
shut up !

i need the clothes you're wearing .
your ring .
your watch .
all your lds .
now .

come with me .
grab the other one .
let's go .
put your clothes on them .

there's been a murder at 232 alden drive .
send the police .
what are you doing?
they killed you , then turned on each other .
right .
sons of bitches !
shit !
this doesn't work without an audience .
outside .
let's go .
get in .
thank you .
thank you .
anything you ever need , just ask me .
you endangered your life and the us marshals protecting you .
what?
you went to your old restaurant .
you went back to gennaro's?
johnny , are you stupid?
it's the osso buco .
i was fucking dying for a decent meal !
next time , you're dead !
this only happens once .
get out .
that was our ride !
let's go .
go .
you won't see me again , but i'll know your every move .
use your heads , lie low and no one will hurt you .
lf you try to skip out on your testimony , i'll deliver you to the canelli family .
i promise .
i owe you big time .
i'm a stand up guy , you got it?
you ever need anything , you let me know .
what's your name?
honey , he doesn't want to be pen pals .
smile .
you've just been erased .
john , would you look at something?
one is from our shop , the others are real .
what do you think?
that's the fake .
who the hell is that?
lf i tell you , i'd have to kill you .
shut up and run this again .
with a little sleight of hand ... ... one very dead john doe trades places with one very live scumbag .
robert , sit down .
you know ... ... if god was as forgiving as wltsec ... ... hell would be one empty joint .
god doesn't have our court system .
i understand you had a busy night .
some witnesses got careless .
i see .
i had to defuse the situation .
did that include breaking into the county morgue?
someone taught me that improvisation is the heart of field work .
it was you .
ln the old days .
weather's changed .
now every asshole in congress is down our backs .
i'm telling you to walk softly .
ls that why beller called me in?
because of the morgue?
no , no , no .
he doesn't know anything about that .
i don't think he has to .
shadow ops still has some privileges .
you're right .
john ... ... good work .
i had a good teacher .
bullshit .
you had the best .
14, 640 some odd people under wltsec protection ... ... and not one with a profile like this .
that bad?
that good .
this young lady , miss cullen ... ... is a real live , bona fide ... ... honest person .
then why does she need us?
she's a senior executive at cyrez corporation .
they're major defense contractors .
top secret weapons research .
looks like someone inside cyrez is selling out uncle sam .
feds need her to prove their case .
lf they do ... ... she'll be the key witness in the hottest scandal since lran contra .
when does this go down?
tomorrow .
the sting's in place .
when it's over , she's all yours .
sealed file on relocate .
your eyes only .
as usual , only you and i will be privy to the exact location of your witness .
but , john ... ... there are some serious players in washington ... ... who could be badly burned .
so could she .
eelcome to cyrez corporation .
all visitors are required to stop at the security station on the right .
good morning , dave .
she's in .
anything yet?
not yet .
that's right , lady .
we're right here .
we're on .
you hear me?
we hear you .
i look okay?
tell her she looks great .
not bad , miss cullen .
not bad for an amateur .
we're right with you .
yeah .
then let's do it .
good morning , miss cullen .
good morning .
station c?
yes .
and how long today?
ten minutes max .
okay .
you're doing just fine , lee .
let's hope we bought the right combination .
bingo !
shit !
it's okay .
we lose transmission in the vault .
what now?
now we wait .
she better move fast .
she's only got five minutes till the shift change .
what's taking so long?
sweetheart , you've got two minutes left .
shouldn't have used her .
shit !
she's out of time .
welcome back , lee .
we're with you .
miss cullen ... ... mr. donahue would like to see you .
ln a minute .
he said , " right now .
what's going on?
i think they made us .
check the directory .
where's donahue's office?
twenty fifth floor .
i know .
twenty fifth floor .
get backup ready to roll .
this could go south .
what is it , william?
that's someone i trusted for five years .
someone i told others could be trusted .
i was pulling
don't !
we're way beyond bullshit here .
who are you working for?
shit , we're dead .
i should ask you that question .
i thought it was for the us government .
come on , lee .
what do you think we do here?
this isn't the red cross .
we make weapons , things that kill people .
lf the government won't pay the price ... ... it's my job to find someone who will .
treason is part of the corporate strategy?
i asked who you were working for .
you didn't tell me .
my god .
holy shit .
christ .
get her out of there .
what is this?
a camera?
i'm working for the fbl , william .
they heard everything you just said .
they're watching us now .
and you think that makes you safe?
you ... ... have no fucking idea !
how could you do this to me?
i hope you understand , lee .
you leave me no choice .
wait a minute !
stop her !
stop !
hey !
go , go , go !
hard evidence .
it's all yours , gentlemen .
we've handled these situations before .
you haven't answered my question .
we told you there'd be risks .
you told me i'd have complete protection the entire time .
it didn't go as smoothly as we anticipated .
that's an understatement .
remember , miss cullen , you came to us .
i came to you with a clerical error .
you asked for my help .
and we got it .
lf cyrez is selling weapons 'technology , that's high treason .
this disk and your testimony will put them and their co conspirators behind bars .
you've done a great service for your country .
now , it's time to think about your safety .
this is us marshal john kruger , of the witness protection program .
he'll handle your personal security .
my protection?
your new identity , relocation .
i'll take you through it step by step .
what are you talking about?
i'm not going anywhere .
you're in an extremely high risk situation .
that should have been explained to you .
your boss was just a middleman , lee .
there are more dangerous people involved .
you expect me to give up my whole life?
until the trial .
then you'll be completely out of danger .
and how do you know that?
how do you know?
look , i will keep up my end of the bargain .
i will testify .
but that's it .
i'm going home .
put people on her right away ... ... or we'll need a seance for her testimony .
who brought her into this?
she volunteered .
she had security clearance
you told her it's a walk in the park .
when she finds out her life isn't her own anymore , it's too late .
we had no case without her .
it's easier to put her ass on the line than yours , isn't it?
sully .
frediano , how're you doing?
good .
i have something for you .
let's see .
your receipt .
gentlemen , always a pleasure .
it's me .
your music has arrived .
get mr. morehart down here .
it's me .
lee?
i heard about donahue .
are you okay?
i'm fine .
i shouldn't have trusted them .
of course not .
the feds are idiots .
they'll blow the case or bury it .
the feds are here .
they're watching me .
let me write this story and i'll nail cyrez all over the front page .
it may not be safe to talk on this phone .
i'll call you later . eait .
did you make a copy?
yeah .
that's your insurance , lee .
go public .
they won't dare touch you .
lee , what's wrong?
i don't know .
i got to go .
hi , baby .
what are you doing here?
waiting for you .
how are you doing?
so you just let yourself into my house?
i've been worried about you .
i haven't heard from you in days .
there's nothing to talk about .
it's over .
you know that .
come on .
that doesn't hurt you to say that?
it hurt me three months ago .
but after the phone calls , after the notes on my car , and tonight ... ... it's getting a lot easier .
get down .
who're you seeing?
come on , darryl .
i know you're seeing someone .
let's see who that is .
what's this?
and a card .
get down !
oh , shit !
go , go , go !
come here !
stay down .
i don't have a shot .
you , go , go .
what are you doing?
lighting a fuse .
are you hit?
what?
are you hurt , are you bleeding?
i don't think so .
are they following us?
no .
just calm down .
you'll be fine .
i'm not fine .
they tried to kill me !
darryl's dead .
you're alive .
and i'll keep you that way .
your hand .
there's a first aid kit under your seat .
that weapon , or whatever it was ... ... was from your company , wasn't it?
it's an e. m. prototype .
it's not supposed to exist .
e. m.?
electromagnetic pulse .
no gunpowder , no conventional bullets .
they fire aluminum rounds at almost the speed of light .
a rail gun .
yeah , that's another name for them .
the navy's been working on them for years .
the smallest one i've heard of is mounted on a battleship .
cyrez was contracted to scale them down ... ... to design a compact , hypervelocity pulse weapon .
the most powerful assault rifle on earth .
they took millions , then said it was impossible .
they looked real enough to me .
maybe cyrez found a higher bidder .
defense , cla , nsa ... ... maybe even your people .
still want to put them away?
yes .
i'll hide you until the hearings .
no one will know where .
not my boss , not wltsec .
no one .
can you do that?
the feds knew it'd be a death sentence for you , and let you walk right into it .
i was stupid .
you trusted them , that's all .
now , trust me .
this is morehart .
we have a problem .
go ahead .
this line's secure .
the cullen woman is still alive .
are you serious?
it gets worse .
she has a disk .
she tried to access our program with it .
do you have any idea the risk i took to get this back?
i know .
she must have made a duplicate .
then get it .
whatever it takes !
understood .
one other thing .
i checked her phone records .
and?
she called a woman named lsaacs .
a reporter for the eashington herald .
i see .
you know what has to be done .
do it .
the joint chiefs are ready , mr. undersecretary .
i'll be right there .
thank you .
that's it .
that's everything i am .
that's nothing .
it's a few numbers and some plastic .
what you are is in here .
no one can take that from you .
they'll try .
we'll stop them .
i need the rest .
that's all .
no .
this .
this?
it's st. george .
it's silly , but when i was a kid i used to have nightmares about dragons .
he watched over you .
yeah .
well , that's my job now .
get some sleep .
we'll leave at dawn .
okay .
'night .
there's a place i know , where it's easy to disappear .
there's a woman there i helped .
she testified against the yakuza bosses in san francisco .
her new name is mei ling .
you'll be safe with her until the hearings .
your new name is deborah elliott .
you think of me as a " deborah?
i don't know .
i could have used something more fun , like ... ... " debbie?
deb?
deborah's fine .
aaa credit .
what's my limit?
it is not a license to shop .
i want you to lay low right now .
mei ling will take good care of you .
you know the signal .
91 1 .
i get out of the apartment .
go straight to the pay phone and wait for my call .
it's a public place , with six exits and six ways out .
and ... ... l work alone .
lf anyone comes to you and claims i sent them ... ... use this .
you just pull the trigger .
i guess i won't see you again .
lf everything goes well ... no .
at least not until the trial .
thanks .
thank me when it's over .
undersecretary of defense , daniel harper ... ... spoke before congress today about the cyrez scandal .
the use of private contractors is within the parameters ... ... of defense department spending .
i look forward to the cyrez hearing .
i'm confident ... ... we'll be vindicated of any mismanagement of funds .
thank you , mr. chairman , for the opportunity .
thanks for coming .
you know i don't like meeting outside our normal channels .
it's not my choice .
are they with you?
yeah .
whether i like it or not ....
listen , john ... ... we've got a problem .
what's going on?
someone's murdering our witnesses .
we've got three confirmed kills in the last 48 hours .
who?
not one of yours .
not one of mine .
not yet .
did they break cover?
no .
no , that is the problem .
and there's no way anyone could know all three of their locations .
there's a mole inside wltsec .
beller thinks so .
he may be right .
all three singers were witnesses in some high profile federal cases .
all with international ties .
that's our common thread .
other singers fit the profile .
six .
one's yours and one's mine .
so ... ... we have to replant them immediately .
the jet is fueling as we speak .
i work alone .
you know that .
not today .
beller's orders .
buddy system , cla escorts ... ... three teams .
we're one of them .
fine .
we do yours first .
this is john kruger .
these are agents schiff and calderon .
i forgot which is which .
i'm schiff .
and i'm calderon .
know her?
should l?
she was doing a piece on cyrez .
there could be a connection to your witness .
did someone take her out?
peeled her like an onion .
lf she knew anything , she talked .
this here is deputy monroe .
he's one of ours .
mr. john kruger .
deputy .
sir , it's a pleasure .
nice rig .
how many of these you got?
three .
different parts of the country .
handy for quick relocates .
sometimes we run violent felons for the feds .
chauffeurs for degenerates .
don't you get tired of babysitting scum?
yeah .
but in your case , we'll make an exception .
who the hell does he think he is?
he thinks he's the best guy in the game .
i think he's right .
try not to piss him off .
you're east .
you're west .
you're north .
here .
we've got the boathouse , garage , back door .
we take the front entrance?
you and me , buddy .
i don't want to get shot today .
keep your safeties on .
we'll probably find her inside baking muffins .
this is my witness .
her name is allison .
she's a very nice lady .
let's bring her out safely .
here you go .
let's go , big guy .
the engine's still warm .
shut up !
you're early .
you're late .
hush , now .
he won't hurt you anymore .
get an ambulance !
go on !
sorry , honey .
we lost her .
why send five men to kill one woman?
they were waiting for us .
we've been set up .
ls she yours?
call her now .
there are no phones .
we must live contact her .
where is she?
atlanta .
let's move , then .
here .
you'll like this better .
are you all right?
i think so , sir .
first time under fire?
it's okay to be shaky .
hell , i'm shaky .
the thing is , sir ... ... l don't know what i feel .
it was terrible and ....
exciting at the same time?
nothing to be ashamed of .
it's perfectly natural .
tell him .
it's natural .
the whole game's that way .
it's like a drug .
you get hooked , there's no turning back .
take me .
my old man ... ... a little nobody in d. c.
nice , quiet guy .
anyway , on his deathbed ... ... he tells me that all those years he was working for the cla .
i had to be part of that world .
i joined the cla , couple of years ... now i'm at wltsec .
hey , buddy .
what about you , sir?
why did you join wltsec?
sir , is something wrong?
answer the kid .
go ahead .
sir?
come on .

what the hell is going on?
he cleared the numbers .
what the hell?
quiet .
did you capture that call?
got it .
new york prefix .
taxi !
city zoo .
new york .
tell him to change course .
i'll call wltsec .
no , that won't be necessary .
we must report flight plan changes .

evaluation?

four or five guys we can trust .
get them ready .

confused?
new york .
you're off course .
no , we're not .
you're going to take us to her .
you did a very , very bad thing .
you killed monroe .
now that makes you the mole .
that makes you a murderer .
easy , big john .
i'm a businessman .
a very , very serious businessman .
businessman?
selling weapons with your old cla pals?
ls it just the money?
trying to start your own dirty , little war somewhere?
wars?
wars , john?
wars come and go .
we did nam , we lost .
we did the gulf , we won .
what changed?
nothing .
nothing ever does .
the only difference is who gets rich and who gets dead .
personally , john , i prefer rich .
you must be a very rich man by now .
it doesn't have to end like this .
i can make you part of it .
a big part .
just give up the girl .
what do you say?
drop your gun .
what?
lf you drop your gun now ... ... l promise i won't kill you .
i'll have to take my chances .
you nailed me with this cheap piece of mail order shit !
think about it !
you jump , you'll go through there like shit through a goose !
you're right !
engine fire !
turn this thing around !
i'm trying to keep us in the air !
turn it around and take him out !
now !
i want his face all over this windshield .
oh , man .
did that hurt?
it had to hurt .
i saw it .
where is this?

three pickups of solo women within 1 5 minutes of the call .
drop offs?
madison and 53rd .
89th and central park west .
new york city zoo .
that's it .
the zoo?
first a run signal , then straight to a public meeting place .
your shooters?
standing by .
i want two teams to sweep from the north and the south .

ladies and gentlemen , the zoo will be closing in ten minutes .
miss cullen?
ma'am , i'm here to help .

two rounds left .
move !
ready to go?
stay down .
when i tell you , head for the door .
go .
let's go .
you're luggage .
how many casualties?
three .
kruger took them out like that , cold .
i can't believe this .
his prints were on the weapon .
you've run prints on him already?
that's moving fast .
i was there .
i saw it .
why would he do a thing like this?
look ... ... the man has nothing to keep him honest .
he's been bought .
i've known john for years .
we're losing time .
lf he's innocent , why's he on the run?
and his witness?
she's in it with him .
what the hell do you mean?
we identified ourselves .
she shot one of my men .
fine .
do whatever it takes to bring him in .
robert?
sir?
bring him in alive .
captain?
put out a citywide apb .
lock this town up so tight it'll make his balls ache .
beller .
captain .
john , where are you?
deguerin is the mole .
he killed the others to flush out my witness .
come in .
i must protect my witness !
you'll put her in danger .
you'll both end up dead .
deguerin has been bought .
my witness knows too much .
federal agents say you are the shooter .
i'll call you back . ehen?
when i have proof .
it's gone too far .
we're on our own .
what can we do?
we can't stay on the run for long .
we need some hard evidence .
you kept a copy?
i was supposed to give it to a friend of mine , a reporter .
she asked me  claire lsaacs?
how did you know?
she's dead .
they killed her .
how could they have known?
i didn't tell anyone .
i know .
it's not your fault .
they probably tapped her phone .
there are many ways ....
everything's going to be all right .
i was just trying to cover myself .
i didn't know who i could trust .
now , i'll get us both killed .
no .
this may be all that keeps us alive .
i don't even know what's on that .
we'll find out .
it's completely hacker proof .
there's no way to run it outside cyrez .
then we'll run it from the inside .
it's like a fortress .
we can't go back there .
they'd expect that .
i'd hate to disappoint them .
the streets are clear .
the police have returned to the safety of their donut shops .
this is father rodriguez .
pleasure .
i was not always father rodriguez .
i was born again , with a little help from our friend .
his colombian associates wanted to introduce him to god personally .
i've been given a second chance at life .
this time , i'm using it for god's work .
anything else i can do?
we need a car .
just for a day or two .
done .
it burns as much oil as gas , but it's yours .
you sure about this?
there's no one else i can trust .
it's raining men , hallelujah , it's raining men
hello , johnny .
you !
i need to talk to you right away .
i've got one question .
was it your idea to hook me up with the village people here?
you're safe?
from the mob , yeah .
no self respecting wiseguy would be caught dead in a joint like this .
do me just one favor .
don't let on that i'm straight .
i don't want to break any hearts .
trust me .
you said if i ever need anything , i could come to you .
i need your help .
wait .
you need my help?
now .
you got it .
cover me for a few seconds .
i got to help a friend .
who's he?
he looks rough !
don't start .
do you two need a moment alone?
we're fine , thanks .
just an idea .
kevin just ... worries about me .
don't ask .
you want me to help you break into cyrez?
yeah .
you shitting me?
i thought i'd help you move a sofa or something .
pull over up ahead .
i'll help you out .
all we'll need is some tanks , a few rocket launchers ... ... and a set of balls like the king of bayonne .
all you need are these .
i'll meet you at his place .
do i look like i've got gas?
gentlemen .
what's going on?
it will be contained in 24 hours .
not good enough .
we have problems .
they're solvable .
we must cancel the shipment .
not an option .
what do we do with ten tons of assault weaponry that's not supposed to exist?
i am the eyes and ears of your world .
there's too much heat .
you don't get it .
the money has changed hands .
these are not the kind of people you cancel on .
get those guns out of the country tonight or you're dead .
now ... ... how will you contain the situation?
kruger has to show up at cyrez .
i'll be waiting .
why would he risk it?
the disk is the only thing that'll clear him and the woman .
this better work .
the disk .
the girl .
the guns .
by dawn , they don't exist .
clear?
yeah .
crystal .
the house armed services committee announced that in two weeks ... ... it will begin official hearings into the cyrez scandal .
it's crawling with reporters .
we've got to keep a lid on this mess .
by tomorrow you'll be chuckling about this in your kiss ass country club .
who's running this camera?
i am .
this is james haggerty , head of security .
good .
we'll keep everything nice and low profile .
ever do any wetwork?
on three different continents .
to impress me , slick , do your fucking job .
how many people do you have?
twelve experienced professionals .
they'll do whatever it takes .
plus 20 more on the security force , who'll follow orders .
fine .
make sure my man has your full cooperation .
we've got every possible point of entry under surveillance ... ... from the rooftop to the sewers .
he's a ghost .
lf he wants in , he'll get in .
where's he got to go to run this disk?
the central vault .
no other terminal can access it .
lf he wants to read the disk , there's only one way in .
outstanding , gentlemen .
all we do is sit back and wait for mr. kruger to come to us .
where are you going?
take it easy .
i've got a delivery for blevens , 14th floor .
