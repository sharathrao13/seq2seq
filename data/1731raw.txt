they're early work was a little too new wave for my taste .
but when <i>sports</ i> came out in '83 ,
i think they really came into their own , commercially and artistically .
the whole album has a clear , crisp sound , and a new sheen of consummate professionalism ... that really gives the songs a big boost .

in '8 7 , huey released this <i> </ i> [ rock ]
<i>fore, </ i> their most accomplished album .
i think their undisputed masterpiece is " hip to be square .
the song's so catchy , most people probably don't listen to the lyrics .
but they should , because it's not just about ... the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends .
it's also a personal statement about the band itself .

<i>i'm at a loss . </ i>
he was part of that whole yale thing .
<i>" yale thing "? </ i>
yeah , yale thing .
what do you mean , " yale thing "?
well , i think for one that he was probably a closet homosexual ... who did a lot of cocaine .
that " yale thing .
what kind of man was he , besides the information you've just given?
i hope i'm not being cross examined here .
you feel like that?
no , not really .
where did paul hang out?
<i>hang out? </ i>
yeah , you know , hang out .
let me think .
um , the newport , harry's ,
fluties , indochine ,
nell's , the cornell club , <i>the new york yacht club . </ i>
he had a yacht?
no , he just hung out there .
and where did he go to school?
don't you know this?
i just wanted to know if you know .
before yale , if i remember correctly , st. paul's .
listen , i just i just wanna help .
i understand .
do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
well , there's a message on his answering machine that says he went to london .
well , maybe he did , huh?
his girlfriend doesn't think so .
but has anyone seen him in london?
actually , yes .
hmm .
<i>but i've had a hard time</ i> <i>getting actual verification . </ i>
a stephen hughes said he saw him at a restaurant there .
but i checked it out , and what happened is ... he mistook a herbert ainsworth for paul , so
had his apartment been burglarized?
no , actually , it hadn't .
toiletries were missing , a suit was gone , so was some luggage .
that's it .
i mean , no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything , right?
no , not yet .
as i said , we're not sure .
basically , no one's seen or heard anything .
so typical , isn't it?
<i>it's just strange . </ i>
one day , someone's walking around , going to work , alive , and then
nothing .
people just disappear .
the earth just ... opens up and swallows them .
eerie .
really eerie .
listen , you'll have to excuse me .
i have a lunch meeting with cliff huxtable at four seasons in 20 minutes .
the four seasons?
isn't that a little far uptown?
i mean , aren't you gonna be late?

phil collins ] </ i>
do you like phil collins?
<i>i've been a big genesis fan</ i> <i>ever since the release ... </ i> of their 1 980 album <i>duke . </ i>
before that , i really didn't understand any of their work .
it was too artsy , too intellectual .
it was on <i>duke</ i> where ...
phil collins 'presence became more apparent .
i think <i>invisible touch</ i> is the group's undisputed masterpiece .
it's an epic meditation on intangibility .
at the same time , it deepens and enriches ... the meaning of the preceding three albums .
christie , take off the robe .
listen to the brilliant ensemble playing ... of banks , collins and rutherford .
you can practically hear every nuance of every instrument .
sabrina , remove your dress .
<i>in terms of</ i> <i>lyrical craftsmanship</ i> <i>and sheer songwriting, </ i> <i>this album hits a new peak</ i> <i>of professionalism . </ i>
sabrina , why don't you , uh , dance a little .
<i>take the lyrics to</ i> <i>" land of confusion . " </ i>
<i>in this song, </ i> <i>phil collins ... </ i> addresses the problems of abusive political authority .
in too deep " is the most moving pop song of the 1 980s ... about monogamy and commitment . <i> [ continues ] </ i>
the song is extremely uplifting .
their lyrics are as positive and affirmative ... as , uh , anything i've heard in rock .
christie , get down on your knees ... <i>so sabrina can see your asshole . </ i>
<i>phil collins'solo career ... </ i> <i>seems to be more commercial, </ i> and therefore more satisfying in a narrower way , especially songs like " in the air tonight " and " against all odds .
sabrina , don't just stare at it .
eat it .
<i>i also think that</ i> <i>phil collins works best ... </ i> <i>within the confines</ i> <i>of the group</ i> <i>than as a solo artist . </ i>
<i>and i stress the word " artist . " </ i>
<i> </ i> [ resumes ]
this is " sussudio .
a great , great song .
a personal favorite .  <i>there's a girl</ i> <i>who's been on my mind</ i> look at the camera . <i>all the time</ i>  <i>su sussuido</ i>  <i>oh , oh</ i>
<i>now , she don't even</ i> <i>know my name</ i>  <i>but i think she likes me</ i> <i>just the same</ i>  <i>su sussuido</ i>  <i>oh , oh</ i>  <i>oh , if she'd call me</ i> <i>i'd be there</ i>  <i>i'd come running</ i>  <i>anywhere</ i> christie , look at the camera . <i>all of my life</ i>  <i>i feel so good</ i>  <i>if i just say the word</ i>  <i>su sussuido</ i>

if they have a good personality and they're not great looking , then who fucking cares?
let's just say hypothetically , okay?
what if they have a good personality?
i know .
i know .
there are no girls with good personalities .
a good personality consists of a chick with a little hard body ... who will satisfy all sexual demands ... without being too slutty about things ... and who will essentially keep her dumb fucking mouth shut .
the only girls with good personalities ... who are smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or talented though god knows what the fuck that means are ugly chicks .
absolutely .
<i>and this is because</ i> <i>they have to make up ... </ i> for how fucking unattractive they are .

when i see a pretty girl walking down the street , i think two things .
one part of me wants to take her out and talk to her , be real nice and sweet and treat her right .
and what did the other part of him think?
what her head would look like on a stick .

so , uh , harold , did you get my message?
jesus , yes .
that was hilarious .
that was you , wasn't it?
yeah , naturally .
bateman killing allen and the escort girls .
that's fabulous .
that's rich .
what exactly do you mean?
the message you left .
by the way , davis , how's cynthia?
you're still seeing her , right?
w wait , harold .
what do you mean?
excuse me .
nothing .
it's good to see you .
is that edward towers?
carnes , wait .
uh
davis , i'm not one to bad mouth anyone .
your joke was amusing .
but come on , man .
bateman is such a dork .
such a boring , spineless lightweight .
now , if you said bryce or mcdermott .
otherwise , it was amusing .
now , if you'll excuse me , i really must be going .
wait .
uh stop .
i did it , carnes .
i killed him .
i'm patrick bateman .
i chopped allen's fucking head off .
the whole message i left on your machine was true .
excuse me .
i really must be going now .
no .
no , listen .
don't you know who i am?
i'm not davis .
i'm patrick bateman .
we talk on the phone all the time .
don't you recognize me?
you're my lawyer .
now , carnes , listen .
listen very , very carefully .
i killed paul allen , and i liked it .
i can't make myself any clearer .
but that's simply not possible .
and i don't find this funny anymore .
it never was supposed to be .
why isn't it possible?
it's just not .
why not , you stupid bastard?
because i had dinner with paul allen ... twice in london just ten days ago .
no , you ... didn't .
now , if you'll excuse me .
