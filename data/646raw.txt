corto , what are you doing outside?
it's time for me to go .
venice is making me lazy .
that is what venice is for .
would you like a glass of rosolio?
rosolio?
i didn't know that still existed .
but , gold lips , when did you come here?
i came in 1300 with the cabalist
mancello giudeo .
we were friends of dante's then , but you just have to open that door to travel through time ,
like in a fable .
i would like to live in a fable .
your life is one big fable yet you don't realize it anymore .
an adult who enters the world of fables cannot leave it .
did you know that?
perhaps we are late ...
today's december 34th .
it still isn't new year's day .
ah , yes , yes ...
but christmas was the 27 th .
in venice , the years are always a little longer .
what are you making them?
thieves , only to punish them .
i never could read that book .
forget it , corto .
you wouldn't have time .
your horoscope says you're going on a long adventure .
are you sleeping?
hong kong , february 15th 1919
the 9 , by virtue of change , becomes an entirely moving line ...
a strong line may become a weak one , and it's in this way that we obtain ...
i don't remember ...
i'm getting old ...
ah yes , yes !
the sign of the marrying maiden .
undertakings bring misfortune " .
corto maltese , are you sleeping?
no , i was thinking of venice and gold lips .
you said young girls don't marry adventurers?
well , too bad !
that means i'll never get married !
you always want to joke , corto .
i never joke .
these are hard times .
the russians are fighting in the north , the japanese in the east .
the religious sects are becoming political organizations , united against the foreigners .
the white lotus ...
and what are you doing , long life?
red triangle will wait for word from black diamond to transmit it to pink square who will inform white rectangle ...
sounds like a geometry class .
corto ...
when will you ever be serious?
i am , long life .
how do i look?
splendid !
the young women of hong kong will be crazy about you .
brother of the night salutes you ...
the triad watches over you , corto maltese .
war in europe is over !
it continues in siberia , in mongolia , in manchuria ...
war in europe is over !
good evening , rasputin .
why are you in hong kong?
hong kong isn't reserved for you , as far as i know .
you're quite elegant in that trench coat .
it's a present .
you like her?
who?
that junk over there .
are you bored?
i'm never bored , you know that .
come on , let's try and find a drink .
you'll always live in a dream world .
maybe you're right .
it's the time to do business !
with these wars between bolsheviks ,
white russians , mongols , chinese , you can get rich !
that's a job for vultures .
i could kill you !
you'll kill me some other time .
there's blood at your feet .
where's the man who was with you?
is this a riddle?
the situation isn't simple .
in fact , it's extremely muddled !
the city is full of russian refugees ... adventurers ... pirates ...
like this person who was with you ...
this " captain rasputin " ...
we've been looking for him for months .
he's with you .
chance or coincidence?
probably both , lieutenant barrow .
i know a lot about you , corto maltese .
you were already in china in 1905 and 1913 .
you indulged in piracy in the south seas .
you're allied with a chinese secret society !
am i so popular in your police stations?
a police officer must suspect everyone , commander .
may i go now?
what are you making them?
thieves , only to punish them .
i never could read that book .
you're back at last .
that's good .
i'm glad you're here .
me too , hu .
did you receive everything?
yes .
but money isn't everything .
sometimes we need to meet .
a letter was brought for you this morning .
this letter is perfumed ...
do you recall a morning of butterflies , an afternoon of wildflowers?
the red lanterns are looking for you .
what is it?
another secret society?
the red lanterns are very brave young women .
they oppose all the other secret societies .
if i were you , i'd listen to them .
rasputin !
lost your touch , ras?
you used to be a great knife thrower .
i still am .
otherwise you wouldn't be here you'd be dead .
but why did you disappear this afternoon?
you were surprised?
and the blood stains?
i played a trick on you .
i cut myself while you were talking to make you think that something happened to me .
we haven't had an adventure in years , like the one with the monk or the royal fortune ...
escondida island ...
santo ...
do you remember?
ras , you're crazy !
i could kill you !
aren't you tired of repeating yourself?
here , take your knife .
it's not my knife !
isn't this your friend's knife?
that's my knife !
so ... someone wanted to kill you? !
greetings from the red lanterns , corto maltese .
the red lanterns have a business proposition .
are you ready to listen to us?
since you saved my life ...
heard of admiral koltchak's train in siberia?
it's the gold train ...
tsar's gold ...
last year , after the execution of nicolas il ,
koltchak stole the imperial treasure in the name of the counterrevolutionary government .
his armored train is carrying gold .
until now , no one has managed to intercept it .
it interests the warlords ,
manchuria's bandits , the allies in siberia ,
and secret societies .
like yours?
we will recruit the men and finance the enterprise .
but we need someone able to lead the expedition .
we thought of you , corto maltese .
you know she's here in hong kong?
she , who?
you know who i mean .
she's here , but we don't know where .
if you wish , we can search .
those bloody lanterns !
we can use them to get the gold !
i accept you as my associate !
are you out of your mind?
if we accept ... everyone east of moscow will be against us .
think you can find a junk?
at last !
i knew it !
there's the corto that i know ... the same ol 'corto !
give these instructions to the shanghai red lanterns .
they'll help you reach kharbine in manchuria .
here's a thousand gold sterling for your first expenses .
i'll only take the instructions .
if we succeed , we share the expenses and the profits .
i'm your associate , not your employee .
is that clear?
if you wish ...
but didn't you say that two associates is one too many?
i said i didn't like an odd number of associates .
one is too little , and three is too much .
we must go .
we'll send someone for the corpse .
maybe she's still here ...
maybe she's waiting for you ...
that's in the past .
it should no longer have any importance .
perhaps you didn't know it , but i too was in love once .
a young girl from nikolaievsk who took care of me when i was a kid .
i never knew my mother .
she died the day i was born .
doubtless of fright when she saw you !
one more word , and i'll kill you .
calm down .
i have nothing against your mother ... except a certain responsibility ...
why , your boat is fantastic , captain rasputin !
you're right , i was lucky .
i got this junk for next to nothing !
your friend was too lucky .
what do you mean?
the men on this boat are paid by the red sunset society .
they are to eliminate you before we reach shanghai .
the red sunset?
a secret society .
traditionally , they act at sunset .
the red is for blood .
a fine tradition !
they've set a machine gun in the stern .
now go away , we're being watched .
you wanted adventure?
what?
the crew ...
deal with the captain .
ras , where are you?
i'll take care of the machine gun !
hey , you !
were you on the junk?
are you the only survivor?
it looks like it ...
couldn't you lower that gun?
come to shanghai .
gen. chang will decide your fate !
come , sailor , gen. chang will speak with you .
what were you doing on that junk?
looking for an exotic experience?
usually , westerners scorn our junks .
couldn't you afford a crossing on a better ship?
did you know that we have a mutual friend here in shanghai?
you surprise me , general .
mister song , the millionaire ...
mister song ...
or should i say his daughter ,
miss wee lee song?
you're often spoken of in the house of song , commander .
are you back in china for this person?
no , rest assured ...
miss wee lee song has nothing to do with my presence .
if it's not a woman who has earned us the " honor of your presence " in china , it's perhaps ... a train .
a russian train , for example .
filled with gold ...
i don't understand ...
isn't it strange ...
these days , many people are dying without understanding why .
ah , tea !
one of life's rare joys !
and one ear knows how to prepare it so well .
thank you , one ear .
one ear is a tibetan monk .
he heard something he shouldn't have , and his ear was cut off .
but he makes a very good cup of tea .
i'm blind , deaf and dumb , general ...
like the three wise monkeys .
that was someone that didn't know the story of the three wise monkeys .
you may go , commander maltese .
why did you let him go , general?
because he'll lead me to the gold train .
ah , another victim of this craziness .
good !
you always enter a sauna with a pistol and cigar?
yeah .
because i'm jack tippit of the american air force .
as for the cigar , it's gone out .
that's what always happens to a good connecticut cigar .
and the hat?
actually , i don't know ...
and you?
me what?
who are you?
you've asked me too many questions .
are you an anarchist?
bolshevik?
or a romantic revolutionary?
you ask too much , too !
i know you stick a knife in , from the bottom up .
easy ...
i'm not looking for a fight .
i'm tired .
very tired ...
well then , rest .
i can't !
i keep thinking about that woman , her train full of cossacks and murderers .
if you knew the duchess ...
this war couldn't be waged without the trains .
all we know is that , inside their wagons , some wish to escape the conflict , others wish to rule .
they even transport their homeland in their trains !
even the gold of holy russia ...
you still haven't said why you're in shanghai .
i'm just passing through on my way to kharbine in manchuria .
i'm going there too .
i have a spare seat in my plane .
have you never flown?
no .
and i have no wish to try !
that helmet really suits you .
you look like my aunty !
i won't say what you look like !
cheer up , sailor .
it'll take 2 days , excluding stops !
shut up !
hey , there's a plane following us !
what makes you say that?
i'm bored , spatzetov ...
i'm bored to death .
give me the newspapers .
unfortunately , they're a week old .
impossible to find others ...
it's major tippit .
tippit?
be a dear , shoot him down !
stop it !
we got him !
you ok?
corto , meet the world's biggest son of a gun ,
major spatzetov of the ussurian cossacks .
i'm sorry , major .
we thought it was a bolshevik .
how can i make it up to you?
i hope you're not too angry .
they hate their planes being shot down .
these late afternoons in siberia are like nighttime .
how are you , duchess?
i'm well , thank god .
i sometimes thought of you , tippit .
your friend's hurt !
please leave me out of your affairs .
your friend has a bad temper .
he's giving himself airs !
but he's a brave lad .
what's his name?
corto maltese .
the duchess is expressing what a pleasure it is to meet you .
friendship with the allies !
if it isn't profitable to them , they'll abandon us .
you're right .
we should follow von ungern and organize with him and semenov the fight against the bolsheviks , even if von ungern's crazy .
yes , perhaps ...
he thinks mongolia will produce a new horde of warrior aristocrats .
he dreams of founding an asian empire to conquer europe .
he's convinced he's the reincarnation of genghis khan !
all that is deliciously romantic ...
but it's true , we're not united enough .
spatzetov , which side are you on?
yours , your excellency , the most surprising woman i've ever met !
have you known her for long?
last summer in vladivostok ...
a welcome party for the us troops , the social niceties ... the usual foolishness ...
we squandered caviar , champagne ... and duchesses ...
i'd like to stop at the manchurian border .
manchuria is dangerous ...
i must go to kharbine .
i'll try to help you , cortouchka , but the siberian border is controlled by baron von ungern sternberg .
who?
a direct descendant of the teutonic knights .
his family was eliminated by the revolution .
could you? ...
my necklace ...
your necklace is warm ...
yes , i danced and drank with my men .
you have to have fun from time to time .
especially if afterwards , you can pray for forgiveness from our lord ...
here is semenov , chief of the baikal cossacks , general of the wildcat division .
mainly known for his reputation as an assassin !
my dear marina , did you have a nice trip?
serghei semenov , my friend ,
i had a lovely voyage across all of manchuria .
the chinese and japanese adore you !
they don't love me they're using me .
but introduce your friends .
commander corto maltese and major tippit of the us air force .
ataman semenov ... who only believes in his armored trains .
you should believe as much as i do , marina .
oh , come see what the japanese gave me .
and you too , gentlemen .
i'm sure that it'll interest you !
i present to you my destroyer !
with that , i can keep the entire bolshevik army at bay .
my trains and my cannons are powerful .
they're heavy and slow .
anyone ever tell you to keep your mouth shut?
corto maltese ...
your name seems familiar ...
unless it's your head ...
i must have seen it somewhere .
that's impossible .
my head has never changed places .
it's always been with me !
serghei , you know that i must continue my journey .
koltchak will not wait .
true .
and you're the only one the admiral still trusts .
our future will soon be in your hands , marina .
tippit is continuing with me .
corto maltese must get to kharbine , in manchuria .
can you help him?
i'll take care of it .
you'll take care of it how?
don't worry , marina .
nothing will happen to your sailor .
i hope i'll see you again ... some day .
me too .
beware of semenov .
goodbye , corto .
goodbye , jack .
gen. semenov ordered me to kill you once you crossed the border .
corto maltese , welcome to manchuria !
semenov doesn't like you .
i don't like you either .
welcome , corto maltese .
have we already met?
i helped you ... on the junk .
i had a friend on that junk .
a friend?
have you any news of him?
perhaps .
now follow me .
you are expected .
the time has come , corto .
i didn't expect to find red lanterns so far north .
the path of our interests has no end .
so i see ...
the wars in china and manchuria are ruining our people .
we have a lot to learn from the russians .
they electrified the country .
soon , they will eradicate illiteracy .
but you didn't ask me to educate your people .
where is this famous gold train?
have you been able to locate it?
koltchak has taken refuge in irkoutsk , but wants to leave , and semenov is ready to attack him .
who's singing?
a russian officer .
his name is nino .
welcome , sailor !
do you want a drink?
not yet .
why not?
sooner or later , we'll drink together .
fate has it that we love the same woman .
an extremely choosy woman ...
she stole my soul .
that's nonsense .
perhaps ... but this nonsense is all i've got left .
in this snow , even the russian and manchurian guards won't go out !
what should i call you?
call me shanghai li .
i'm ready .
why did you put on this full dress uniform?
because i'm still part of this military insanity .
don't you remember?
she loved uniforms ...
who knows who she gave my soul to?
don't mention that to me again !
we must warn general chang !
you should disguise yourself .
semenov might recognize you .
semenov ...
i'd like a word or two with him .
semenov is the worst enemy and the worst friend one could have .
how did you meet him?
the duchess marina seminova introduced us .
is the duchess pretty?
yes ...
i'd say so .
what did you say?
i said yes .
when you're near her , it's like being near something warm and soft .
merry christmas , corto !
corto , my friend ...
merry christmas !
but today's not christmas !
so what?
we celebrate christmas whenever we please !
i found you again , corto !
corto , corto , corto !
rasputin !
it's really you?
who else would it be?
your aunty?
i lost you in shanghai .
now i find you in siberia .
you always underestimate me .
that's your mistake .
caviar and vodka , corto !
things from back home ...
like the gold that we're going to steal !
to russian gold !
it won't be easy .
there's this semenov ...
i was with two friends .
where'd they go?
that's me .
got it?
right , let's deal with this semenov !
commander , the americans control the entrance to the railroad at tchita .
the americans?
i thought it was the japanese ...
in any case , what counts is the junction at karymskoe .
that's where we'll wait for koltchak's train .
make sure the line's open for our return .
yes , commander .
and don't disturb me again !
why are you looking at me?
you're looking at me too !
hey , you two !
are you in the cast for the troupe's theater?
what cast?
what theater are you talking about , imbecile?
we're officers in the venetian navy , sent as military advisers to the siberian and mongol cossacks .
why not marco polo and his uncle en route to cathay?
show me your papers !
one moment , captain .
i'll answer for these two officers .
you may go .
yes , sir !
you were wrong to make fun of him .
do the cossacks lack a sense of humor?
with semenov , even those who had one , lost it ...
what happened the other night?
you disappeared in a snowstorm .
i always disappear in snowstorms .
i can't help it .
is that the duchess?
yes , i think so .
about time !
at last we can get out of here .
and go where?
your excellency , the bolsheviks have taken irkoutsk .
we were decimated .
we retreated , but we can't hold out much longer .
and the admiral?
admiral koltchak was betrayed by the czechoslovakian legionnaires .
the bolsheviks threw his body into the angara river .
we must leave , your excellency .
we haven't time to transfer the gold .
bring your men on our train .
the honor of taking the imperial gold goes to you .
it was his excellency the admiral's wish .
serghei , what are the americans like?
the americans?
they're yids ...
they're all jews from wall street !
ungern was right when he said that the yids want to divide up the world .
but it's not just the bankers who're yids !
lenin and trotsky are also yids , subversive yids and bolsheviks ...
but my family's jewish too , serghei .
i saved them from a pogrom !
have you forgotten?
no !
no ...
i just thought ...
you're starting to think , macha? !
i said i wasn't to be disturbed !
bring me another girl !
when an object wants to become a subject , it's no longer useful !
do you want to follow her example?
are you a freethinker , too?
me?
i've only just arrived with one of your officers .
captain laroslav .
nino !
that madman whose soul was stolen ...
sometimes , he disappears to go look for it , then ... he comes back without having found it .
one day , i'll sew one onto his skin .
come here .
kneel down .
you're very far north for a shanghai girl .
what are you looking for?
around here , you'll die before finding it .
i'm looking for a golden dragon .
a golden dragon?
you must be crazy .
but who knows what your madness is hiding?
massage my head ...
i want to sleep .
i am how i am .
i don't care about politics , because i've chosen to live with tons of money , surrounded by beautiful women and beautiful objects .
to have them , i must steal .
in fact ... you're a thief .
of course i'm a thief .
but what i steal , i spend .
i distribute the money .
lots of people live off what i spend after a robbery .
koltchak's train !
the gold train's coming .
the girl ...
shanghai li , where is she?
she's on this train , too ...
and ready for the big game , like all of us !
the general promised us our share .
we'll be rich .
hurry !
perhaps it's better to die this way , killed by one of our own ...
that semenov is a great guy !
a butcher !
he did all the work !
send someone to unhitch the gold car !
and fast !
i'll go , commander !
traitor !
she was going to kill you !
let's take care of the gold .
stop thinking about that woman !
after the revolution , we'll be rich !
the world will be full of russian duchesses in exile !
it's you , nino ...
what's going on?
did you find your soul?
no , semenov , i didn't find my soul ... but i'm going to kill you .
it's not for the gold .
simply because you're a murderer , unworthy of belonging to the army .
watch out !
a black dragon on their palm !
it must be the triad .
no , it's not the triad .
the black dragon's a sect general chang belongs to .
which way did semenov go?
to the locomotive .
i preferred the leopard outfit , my little shanghai li .
i no longer have the leopard skin , but i've kept the claws .
hurry up !
i don't understand .
the . 45 she's pointing at us is clear !
this gold will serve the cause of the asian revolution !
russia has exploited us for too long .
it's time that the west paid .
if you want to stay alive , jump off the train !
young woman , russia has committed many errors , true , but i'm a russian officer and i must defend what belongs to russia .
as for myself , i think that i'd rather die .
young woman ...
well , i never heard such a ridiculous argument !
in blue summer ends of day ,
i will wander pathways , pricked by hay , splay the tender grass ...
dreaming ,
i'll feel its coolness play at my feet .
let the wind lash my bare brow .
no words , not a thought ...
but infinite love will surge in my soul .
and on i shall wander and on , vagabond .
in nature , as happy as in a woman's company .
what are you thinking about , corto?
arthur rimbaud , a french poet .
at such moments , i think of nothing else .
you're prisoners of baron von ungern sternberg's
asian cavalry !
your hands are beautiful , but small ...
as a child , they must have been chubby and very white .
never mind that .
what do you see?
your life will be short , von ungern .
very short ...
two more years perhaps , no more ... and much blood ...
two years ...
that should be enough for what i have to do .
what else?
i see nothing but blood ... blood ...
will i be victorious?
all i see is , you will kill many ... and you will spill a lot of blood !
we found them in the mountains near three borders lake .
why were you between mongolia and manchuria?
i'm trying to forget someone .
you look like a gypsy , or a sailor , yet you wear a russian officer's cap .
the cap was a gift ...
well?
well , what?
i'm waiting !
waiting for what?
we came to this fair land to steal koltchak's gold ... which ataman semenov himself tried to steal .
and how does it all end?
that , i don't know .
all i can say is , semenov didn't succeed !
fine ...
fine !
in that case , i won't have you shot ... not for now anyway ...
as for this chinese girl , tomorrow she'll go to the military brothel .
she'll entertain my soldiers .
and you who look like that vile rasputin ...
what's your name?
rasputin , excellency !
you must all be crazy !
pardon me , excellency , but the only crazy one here is corto maltese !
you were lucky .
stay out of it , mongol !
ras , you really have an impossible temper .
come in .
at least you'll be warm here .
in xanadu did kubla khan a stately pleasure dome decree , where alph the sacred river ran through caverns measureless to man , down to a sunless sea .
so twice five miles of fertile ground with walls and towers were girdled round .
and there were gardens bright with sinuous rills where blossomed many an incense bearing tree .
and here were forests ancient as the hills , enfolding sunny spots of greenery .
you didn't call me here to talk about coleridge .
why not?
the pen and sword can sometimes go part of the way together .
the pen and giant cannons , perhaps less often !
please , sit down !
i have a proposition .
in 3 days , my division will march in conquest of urga .
from there , i'll go to fight choy balsan and sukay bator .
i don't know either one .
they're subversives .
i must create a new religious war ... a counter revolution more terrible than their own revolution !
it's time to return to the old beliefs .
the ethics of war and shamanism will be our only religions .
from the sea of japan to the gulf of finland , we'll make the yellow sun rise against the red star !
come with me .
assuming that i need to believe in something , why should i choose mongolia rather than ... a secret court , called the " court of the arcane " in venice?
because no one is in complete agreement with himself .
i'm offering you a new empire !
i've turned down so many things .
it's the first time i've been offered an empire .
but i refuse .
i force no one to follow me , corto maltese .
no " is a very nice word , provided that you're the first to say it , and you had that courage ...
let's drink to our future !
excellency , here is the mopa .
praise buddha .
i will read the sacred word ...
he's a tibetan diviner .
he'll tell us the secrets of life and death .
the " tree book of fates " has millions of leaves , and on each is written a human's fate .
when someone dies , a leaf falls .
i have seen yours .
there's a black dragon in your life !
a broken black dragon ...
but those like you who know how to live are comfortable even in hell .
and now ... farewell !
remember , corto .
a broken black dragon .
the black dragon ...
it's a chinese military sect .
it is also the name of the amur river .
perhaps he was advising you to go there .
to the amur river?
it's too far .
now go ... with your friends .
farewell , corto maltese .
a beautiful adventure , don't you think?
no , i don't think so !
i want my share of the gold !
all you have to do is dive into three borders lake !
stop this childishness !
i don't find you funny .
i don't see why the baron let us go free .
the shaman told him to .
he also told me to watch out for a broken black dragon !
since the train stopped , his men have been dying of cold and hunger .
and koltchak's gold belongs to you , general .
it's in three borders lake .
it's not so simple .
the red lanterns now have a powerful ally .
the sailor , corto maltese?
no , no ...
the red lanterns will get rid of him now that the gold is in three borders lake .
the region's controlled by sukay bator .
he's the red lanterns 'main ally .
but admiral von ungern is also
in the region to fight sukay bator .
perhaps .
but not for now ... and not for gold .
we will have to confront sukay bator .
sukay bator , my friend .
i'm shanghai li .
remember me?
yes , i also remember you had another name .
you must've had good reason to change .
who's this russian officer?
he is neither .
he is corto maltese .
he's your husband?
no .
he's a lone wolf .
general chang's train !
pulling into the valley !
that warlord never came this far before .
we must stop him going any further .
we'll soon be in bolkang nor .
we'll stop to let the men amuse themselves before going on .
let them go see the women .
but watch out for deserters .
hey , you !
you in the right car?
you talking to me?
yes , you .
i've never seen you before .
me neither !
corto ...
yes?
is there a reason why we're doing this?
is your conscience bothering you?
i'm just asking .
can't i ask you as a friend to help me continue our adventure?
you wanted some adventure !
you can shoot when you want to !
what?
what do you think about me?
tell me honestly .
what's that got to do with anything?
i just want to know .
i'd love to have friends , but i'm unable to .
why on earth not?
aren't i like other folks?
of course you are .
actually , no .
maybe not .
and stop asking questions !
there , you attack me when i tell you , all i want is friends !
general , a mutiny !
the gunners are shooting each other !
beautifully done , comrade shanghai li .
we're proud of you !
i'm sorry .
we can't go see if they're among the survivors .
we must go back to the lake .
i know .
are you crying?
me?
crying?
you're mistaken .
besides , it's my business !
you have a bad temper , comrade .
but that's your business , too .
i really thought then , i'd never see him again .
i only learned later corto got out alive , that he was one of the rare survivors .
there must be a guardian angel for sailors !
he was transferred to kharbine military hospital with a friend of his , a guy named rasputin .
corto's eyes had been injured .
shortly after , he was better .
i helped him leave for hong kong .
he insisted on going .
when speaking about the duchess ,
i felt he was hiding something from me .
corto maltese arrived during the month of march .
i was happy to see him again .
times were hard , but he seemed to be the only one not to notice .
he knew that ...
chang had survived and was hiding here , in hong kong .
the triad had decided to eliminate the warlord .
so ... we helped corto find him .
for him , it had become a personal matter .
but i'll try to be more precise ...
it was nighttime ...
i knew , through a triad friend , you were alive .
it was a beautiful adventure .
what was the girl's name?
shanghai li .
it sounds like an american operetta .
lieutenant , how may i help you?
i arrest you in the name of the british crown .
and what am i accused of?
pillage , armed mutiny , massacre , arms trafficking and treason .
one ear , bring the tea .
thanks , but we don't have time .
major osborne and colonel rand are waiting .
you're still in hong kong?
i thought you'd left .
i left , and i came back .
there was poison in his tea .
the servant did it !
he carried out his master's orders .
perhaps , but it's still homicide .
one ear , you'll need a good lawyer .
i'll take care of it .
thank you .
i thought you were mute?
that's it .
that's all i can tell you .
he went to the region of kiang si .
for what reason ...
i do not know .
who are those girls?
apprentice red lanterns?
yes , but for now , they're students at the new school in kiang .
i'm their teacher .
you wonder where the gold is?
we managed to fish it out of three borders lake .
it will be used to build a big hydroelectric plant .
asia and the weak red lanterns thank you .
the weak red lanterns "?
how's your friend rasputin?
he stayed for a week in hong kong .
then he left , taking my gauguin with him .
he wrote me a letter !
meet ling , an agricultural engineer .
ling is my husband .
i was curious to meet you , mr corto maltese .
second beauty spoke about you a lot .
second beauty is my real name .
i know you met during a revolutionary action in manchuria .
she was wonderful !
but you were wonderful , too !
tonight , the students and farmers wish to organize a theatrical performance in your honor .
i'll leave you .
you must have a lot to talk about .
ling is a marvelous man .
i didn't want ...
where will you go?
i don't know ...
farewell , shanghai li .
