i could have told you that , looking at his bill .
go inside , have a drink , enjoy the party .
i'll see you in a little bit .
thanks for coming .
do you know anyone here?
not a soul .
why do you think ziegler invites us to these things every year?
this is what you get for making house calls .
you see that guy at the piano?
i went to medical school with him .
really?
he plays pretty good for a doctor .
he's not a doctor .
he dropped out .
ladies and gentlemen , i hope you 're enjoying yourselves .
the band's going to take a break .
we'll be back in 1 0 minutes .
thank you .
let's go over and say hello .
i desperately need to go to the bathroom .
you go and say hello , and i'll meet you where?
at the bar?
good .
nightingale .
nick nightingale !
oh , my god !
bill .
bill harford !
how the hell are you , buddy?
how long has it been?
i don't know .
1 0 years?
and a couple .
do you have time for a drink?
sure .
you haven't changed a bit .
thanks , i think .
so how you doing?
not too bad , you know .
not too bad .
i see you've become a pianist .
oh , yes , well , my friends call me that .
how about you?
you still in the doctor business?
once a doctor , always a doctor .
never a doctor , never a doctor .
i never did understand why you walked away .
it's a nice feeling .
i do it a lot .
cheers .
excuse me .
nick , i need you a minute .
be right with you .
i gotta go do something .
lf i don't catch you later . . . . . . l'll be down at the village for two weeks at the sonata caf .
stop by if you get a chance .
i'll be there .
it's great seeing you .
good seeing you too , man .
i think that's my glass .
l 'm absolutely certain of it .
my name is sandor szavost .
l 'm hungarian .
my name is alice harford .
l 'm american .
delighted to meet you , alice .
did you ever read the latin poet ovid on the art of love?
didn't he wind up all by himself . . . . . . crying his eyes out . . . . . . in some place with a very bad climate?
but he also had a good time first .
a very good time .
are you here with anyone tonight , alice?
with my husband .
oh , how sad .
but then l 'm sure he's the sort of man who wouldn't mind if we danced .
what do you do , alice?
well , at the moment . . . . . . l 'm looking for a job .
i used to manage an art gallery in soho .
but it went broke .
what a shame .
i have some friends in the art game .
perhaps i can be of some help .
thank you .
someone you know?
my . . . . . . husband .
don't you think one of the charms of marriage . . . . . . is that it makes deception a necessity for both parties?
may i ask why a beautiful woman . . . . . . who could have any man in this room , wants to be married?
why wouldn't she?
ls it as bad as that?
as good as that .
do you know nuala windsor?
no , and it's very lovely to meet you both .
how do you spell nuala?
n u a l a.
you don't remember me , do you?
you were very kind to me once .
only once?
that sounds like a terrible oversight !
i was doing a photo session in rockefeller plaza . . . . . . on a very windy day . . .?
and you got something in your eye .
just about half of fifth avenue .
you were such a gentleman !
you gave me your handkerchief . . . . . . which was also clean .
that is the kind of hero i can be sometimes .
you know why women used to get married , don't you?
why don't you tell me?
it was the only way they could lose their virginity . . . . . . and be free to do what they wanted with other men .
the ones they really wanted .
fascinating .
do you know what's so nice about doctors?
usually a lot less than people imagine .
they always seem so . . . . . . knowledgeable .
oh , they are very knowledgeable . . . . . . about all sorts of things .
but i bet they work too hard .
just think of all they miss .
you 're probably right .
ladies , where exactly are we going?
exactly?
where the rainbow ends .
where the rainbow ends?
don't you want to go where the rainbow ends?
now that depends where that is .
well , let's find out .
excuse me , ladies .
sorry , dr. harford .
could you come with me for a moment?
something for mr. ziegler .
fine .
to be continued?
bill , thanks for coming .
we had a little accident here .
what happened?
well , she was . . . .
she was shooting up and she had a bad reaction .
what did she take?
a speedball or a snowball or whatever the hell they call it .
it's heroin and coke .
heroin and coke?
anything else?
we had a couple of drinks , some champagne .
that was it .
how long has she been like this?
maybe five minutes , six minutes , something like that .
what's her name?
mandy .
can you hear me , mandy?
can you hear me?
move your head if you can hear me .
move your head if you can hear me , mandy .
there you go .
you can hear me .
can you open your eyes for me?
mandy , can you do that?
let me see you open your eyes .
there you go , come on .
come on , look at me .
look at me .
look at me .
look at me .
look at me .
look at me , mandy .
good .
good .
i love victor's art collection , don't you?
it's wonderful .
have you ever seen his sculpture gallery?
i haven't .
he has a wonderful collection of renaissance bronzes .
do you like the period?
i do .
i adore it .
the sculpture gallery is upstairs .
would you like to see it?
i can show it to you .
we won't be gone long .
maybe . . .
. . . not just . . .
. . . now .
that was really one hell of a scare you gave us , kiddo .
sorry .
how are you feeling now , mandy?
better .
you are a very , very lucky girl .
you know that?
i know .
you 're gonna be okay this time .
but you can't keep doing this .
you understand?
you 're going to need some rehab .
you know that , don't you?
i know .
well , victor . . .
. . . l'll leave the rest to you .
ls it okay if i dress her and get her out of here?
no , i'd keep her here for another hour .
another hour?
then i'd have someone take her home .
good night , mandy .
i can't thank you enough for this .
you saved my ass .
l 'm glad i was here .
bill , i probably . . . .
i know i don't have to mention this . . . . . . but this is just between us .
of course .
thanks .
i think i've had a little too much champagne .
i think i have to go and find my husband now .
but l 'm sure he'll be all right on his own a little longer .
yes . . .
. . . but will l?
of course you will .
i really have to go .
i have to go .
you don't , you know .
yes , i do .
i must see you again .
that's impossible .
why?
because . . .
. . . l 'm married .
good morning , lisa .
good morning , doctor .
your mail .
good .
please ask janelle to bring me my coffee .
sure .
thank you .
good morning , sarah .
good morning , doctor . " 'twas the night before christmas , when all through the house ... ... not a creature was stirring , not even a mouse .
okay .
that's fine .
you can put your gown on .
hold this for mommy .
looking forward to christmas?
does this hurt?
right there?
daddy's gonna like that .
very good choice . " before me . . . . . . when i jump into my bed .
we should call the zieglers and thank them for the party .
i've taken care of that .
good .
so how do you feel about wrapping the rest of the presents?
let's do that tomorrow .
tell me something .
those two girls . . .
. . . at the party last night . . . .
did you . . . . . . by any chance . . . . . . happen to . . .
. . . fuck them?
what?
what are you talking about?
l 'm talking about the two girls . . . . . . that you were so blatantly hitting on .
i wasn't hitting on anybody .
who were they?
they were just a couple of models .
and where did you disappear to with them for so long?
wait a minute .
i didn't disappear with anybody .
ziegler wasn't feeling too well . . . . . . and i got called upstairs to see him .
anyway , who was the guy you were dancing with?
a friend of the zieglers .
what did he want?
what did he want?
sex . . .
. . . upstairs .
then and there .
ls that all?
yeah , that was all .
just wanted to fuck my wife .
that's right .
well , i guess that's understandable .
understandable?
because you are a very . . .
. . . very beautiful woman .
wait .
because l 'm a beautiful woman . . . . . . the only reason any man ever wants to talk to me . . .
. . . is because he wants to fuck me .
ls that what you 're saying?
well , i don't think it's quite that black and white . . .
. . . but i think we both know what men are like .
so on that basis . . . . . . l should conclude that you wanted to fuck those two models .
there are exceptions .
and what makes you an exception?
what makes me an exception is that . . .
. . . l happen to be in love with you .
and because we 're married . . . . . . and because i would never lie to you . . . . . . or hurt you .
do you realize that what you 're saying . . . . . . is that the only reason you wouldn't fuck those models . . . . . . is out of consideration for me?
not because you really wouldn't want to .
let's just relax , alice .
this pot is making you aggressive .
no !
it's not the pot .
it's you !
why can't you ever give me a straight fucking answer?
i was under the impression that's what i was doing .
i don't even know what we 're arguing about here .
l 'm not arguing .
l 'm just trying to find out where you 're coming from .
where l 'm coming from?
let's say , for example , you have some gorgeous woman . . . . . . standing in your office naked . . . . . . and you 're feeling her fucking tits .
now , what i want to know . . . .
i want to know what you 're thinking about when you 're squeezing them .
alice , i happen to be a doctor .
it's all very impersonal . . . . . . and you know there's always a nurse present .
so when you 're feeling tits , it's nothing more than your professionalism?
exactly .
sex is the last thing on my mind when l 'm with a patient .
now , when she is having her little titties squeezed . . . . . . do you think she ever has fantasies . . . . . . about what handsome dr. bill's dickie might be like?
come on , i can assure you sex is the last thing . . . . . . on this fucking hypothetical woman patient's mind .
and what makes you so sure?
lf for no better reason . . . . . . because she's afraid of what i might find .
so after you tell her that everything's fine , what then?
what then?
i don't know , alice . . . .
what then?
women don't . . . .
they basically just don't think like that .
millions of years of evolution , right?
men have to stick it every place they can . . . . . . but for women , it is just about security and commitment . . . . . . and whatever the fuck else !
a little oversimplified , alice .
but yes , something like that .
lf you men only knew .
what i do know is you got stoned , you tried to pick a fight . . . . . . and now you 're trying to make me jealous .
but you 're not the jealous type , are you?
no , l 'm not .
you've never been jealous about me , have you?
no , i haven't .
and why haven't you ever been jealous about me?
well , i don't know , alice .
maybe because you 're my wife .
maybe because you 're the mother of my child . . . . . . and i know you would never be unfaithful to me .
you are very , very sure of yourself . . . . . . aren't you?
no .
l 'm sure of you .
do you think that's funny?
all right .
fuck it .
now we get the fucking laughing fit , right?
do you . . . .
do you remember last summer at cape cod?
do you remember one night in the dining room . . . . . . there was this young naval officer . . . . . . and he was sitting near our table with two other officers?
no .
the waiter brought him a message , at which point he left .
nothing rings a bell?
well . . .
. . . l first saw him that morning in the lobby .
he was checking into the hotel . . . . . . and he was following the bellboy with his luggage . . . . . . to the elevator .
he glanced at me as he walked past .
just a glance .
nothing more .
but i could hardly . . .
. . . move .
that afternoon . . .
. . . helena went to the movies with her friend . . .
. . . and you and i made love .
and we made plans about our future . . .
. . . and we talked about helena .
and yet . . .
. . . at no time . . .
. . . was he ever . . .
. . . out of my mind .
and i thought if he wanted me . . .
. . . even if it was only . . .
. . . for one night . . .
. . . l was ready to give up everything .
you .
helena .
my whole fucking future .
everything .
and yet it was weird , because at the same time . . .
. . . you were dearer to me than ever .
and at that moment , my love for you . . .
. . . was both . . .
. . . tender and sad .
i barely slept that night . . .
. . . and i woke up the next morning in a panic .
i didn't know whether i was afraid that he had left . . .
. . . or that he might still be there .
but by dinner . . .
. . . l realized he was gone . . .
. . . and i was . . . . . . relieved .
yes , this is dr. harford .
when did it happen?
i have the address .
thank you .
lou nathanson just died .
i think i have to go over there and show my face .
hello , rosa .
good evening , dr. harford .
how is miss nathanson?
not so good .
she's in the bedroom .
thank you .
come in .
marion . . . .
oh , dr. harford . . . .
how good of you to come .
i came as soon as i got the message .
thank you .
l 'm so sorry .
thank you .
your father was . . . .
he was a very brave man .
oh , thank you .
how are you holding up?
l 'm a bit numb .
i don't think it's really sunk in yet .
would you like to sit down?
it's so unreal .
daddy had such a good day .
his mind was clear , and he remembered so many things .
then he had a little dinner . . . . . . and he said he felt like taking a nap .
i went into the kitchen and talked to rosa for half an hour at most . . .
. . . and when i went to see how he was . . . . . . l just thought he was asleep .
then i realized he wasn't breathing .
from what you've said . . . . . . l 'm sure your father died peacefully in his sleep .
oh , god , i hope so .
i think i've been more afraid of the way it was going to happen . . . . . . than his death itself .
have you had a chance to phone any of your relatives?
i tried to call my stepmother in london , but she was out .
my boyfriend , carl , is making some calls . . . . . . and he'll be coming over soon .
i think you've met carl here a few times .
yes , i remember him .
he's a teacher , isn't he?
a math professor .
we 're going to get married in may .
well , that's wonderful news .
congratulations .
thank you .
carl has a new teaching appointment at the university of michigan .
we'll be moving out there soon .
michigan's a beautiful state .
i think you'll like it a lot .
it really could be a wonderful change for you , marion .
oh , my god , no . . . .
i love you .
i love you .
i love you , i love you , i love you .
i don't want to go away with carl .
marion , i don't think you realize
i do .
even if l 'm never to see you again , i want at least to live near you .
marion , listen to me .
listen to me .
you 're very upset , and i don't think you realize what you 're saying .
i love you .
we barely know each other .
we haven't had a single conversation about anything except your father .
i love you .
that's probably carl .
please don't despise me .
hello , rosa .
hello , mr. thomas .
ls she in the bedroom?
yes , she is .
thank you .
come in .
darling .
l 'm so very sorry .
are you all right?
l 'm okay .
dr. harford , good evening .
good evening , carl .
thank you very much for coming over here tonight .
it's the least i could do .
it means a lot to us .
thank you .
i was actually on my way out .
marion . . .
. . . your father was very proud of you . . . . . . and i know you gave him great comfort these last months .
thank you .
i'll show you out .
good night .
listen to this .
she had a red rose in her mouth .
she was doing a mexican lap dance right in my face .
l 'm serious !
i got scars on the back of my neck .

no , l 'm just taking a walk .
how'd you like to have a little fun?
l 'm sorry?
have a little fun?
i just live right down there .
would you like to come inside with me?
come inside with you?
it's a lot nicer in there than it is out here .
you live in there?
by yourself?
no .
i have a roommate , but she's not home .
hey , it's okay .
listen , no one will bother us .
it's okay .
come on .
come on .
this is it .
that's a nice tree .
sorry about the mess .
maid's day off .
it's . . .
. . . cozy .
it's a . . .
. . . cozy place .
it's okay .
do you suppose we should talk about money?
yeah , i guess so .
that depends on what you want to do .
what do you want to do?
what do you recommend?
what do i recommend?
i'd rather not put it into words .
how about you just leave it up to me?
l 'm in your hands .
and how does 1 50 sound?
sounds wonderful .
don't worry .
i don't keep track of the time .
thank you .
prego , prego .
grazie .
you're welcome .
if i was italian , he'd have answered me in italian .
shall we?
excuse me .
ls everything all right?
i was just wondering if you were going to be much longer?
listen , it's a little difficult to talk right now .
it could be awhile .
any idea how long?
no , i don't really know .
we 're still waiting for some relatives to arrive .
well , l 'm gonna go to bed now .
was that mrs. dr. bill?
do you have to go?
do i have to go?
i think i do .
are you sure?
yes , l 'm afraid so .
but listen , i want to pay you anyway .
how much did you say it was?
hundred and fifty?
but you know what?
you don't have to bother about that .
no , it's all right .
no , really .
you don't have to .
no , i want to .
really?
well , thank you very much .
thank you .
would you like a table , or would you like to sit at the bar?
i'd like a table .

no .
it may sound ridiculous , but it's in a different place every time . . . . . . and i only get it an hour or so before .

hey , man , i just play the piano .
nick , l 'm sorry .
ls there something l 'm missing here?
i play blindfolded .

i play blindfolded .
you 're putting me on .

excuse me .
yes , sir .
yes , sir , this is nick .
i know where that is .
right .

nick , i'll tell you what .
i've already got the password .
just give me the address .
i'll go there by myself . . . . . . and there won't be any connection between us whatsoever .
listen , let's just say for one second . . . . . . that i was prepared to do that .
you couldn't get in anyway in those clothes .
why not?
because everyone is always costumed and masked .
where the hell are you gonna get a costume at this hour?
thanks .
keep the change .
yes?
who is it?
peter , this is bill harford .
i apologize for disturbing you at this hour , but i need your help .

l 'm very sorry .
l 'm looking for peter grenning . . . . . . the owner of rainbow fashions .
what's your name?
my name is bill harford .
l 'm mr. grenning's doctor .
you are grenning's doctor?
okay .
just a moment .
you are looking for peter grenning?
yes , i am .
he moved to chicago over a year ago .
he moved to chicago?
i wasn't aware of that .
then are you the present owner of rainbow fashions?
yes , i am .
well , first of all . . . . . . please let me apologize again for disturbing you at this hour , mr. . . .
milich .
mr. milich .
just to let you know that i really am dr. harford . . . . . . this is my new york state medical board card .
okay , so you are dr. harford .
lf i see peter , i tell him you were looking for him .
oh , no , wait .
please , please . . . .
listen , the reason that i came here tonight was . . . .
basically , the reason is that i need a costume .
and i'd be happy to pay you $ 1 00 over the rental price . . . . . . for the inconvenience .
a hundred dollars?
i don't think so .
how about $200?
two hundred dollars over the rental price?
come in .
can't be too careful these days .
please .
ls it any special costume you are looking for?
i need a tux , a cloak with a hood and a mask .
a cloak with a hood and a mask?
i think we'll find something for you .
follow me , please .
good .
looks like alive , huh?
it's wonderful .
come .
so what color cloak?
red , brown , red?
black .
the good doctor wouldn't like something more colorful?
i don't think so .
clowns , officers , pirates?
no , just the tux , the black cloak
with a hood and a mask .
may i take your coat?
you are medicine doctor , yes?
yes , i am .
i have some problem with my hair .
your hair?
it's starting to fall down too fast .
i lost , in two weeks , a lot of hair .
mostly here .
look at this .
here .
you see?
and?
l 'm afraid this really isn't my field .
what?
you can't help me?
no .
you should see a trichologist .
it's a hair specialist .
mr. milich , i've obviously left things a bit late tonight .
so if you don't mind
l 'm in hurry too , to get back to bed .
i understand .
so black cloak?
did you hear something?
what is this?
what is it?
what is this?

there's 80 .
i promised you 50 bucks over the meter , right?
i'll make that a hundred , if you wait for me .
just let the meter run .
i'll give you the other half plus the meter when i get back .
okay?

i don't know , maybe an hour or more .
but maybe only 1 0 minutes .
i'll leave my stuff here in the back .
good evening , sir .

can we be of any help?
i suppose you'd like the password .
lf you'd like , sir .
fidelio .

good evening , sir .
good evening .
password , sir?
fidelio .
thank you , sir .
l 'm not sure what you think you 're doing .
but you don't belong here .
l 'm sorry , but i think you've mistaken me for someone else .
please !
don't be foolish .
you must go now .
who are you?
it doesn't matter who i am .
you are in great danger .
you must get away while there's still a chance .
would you be so good as to excuse us for a moment?
have you been enjoying yourself?
well , i've had a very interesting look around .
do you want to go somewhere a little more private?
private?
that might be a good idea .
here you are .
i've been looking all over for you .
may i borrow him for just a few minutes?
i promise to bring him right back .
i don't think you realize the danger you 're in now .
you can't fool them for much longer .
you've got to get away before it's too late .
why are you telling me this?
it doesn't matter .
who are you?
you don't want to know .
but you must go .
now !
will you come with me?
that's impossible .
why?
because it would cost me my life and possibly yours .
let me see your face .
go !
excuse me , sir .
are you the gentleman with the taxi waiting for him?
yes .
your driver's at the front door and would urgently like a word with you .
please , come forward .
may i have the password , please?
fidelio .
that's right , sir .
that is the password . . . . . . for admittance .
but may i ask , what is the password for the house?
the password for the house?
l 'm sorry , l . . . .
i seem to have . . .
. . . forgotten it .
that's unfortunate .
because here , it doesn't matter whether you have forgotten it . . . . . . or if you never knew it .
you will kindly remove your mask .
now . . . . . . get undressed .
get undressed?
remove your clothes .
gentlemen , please . . . .
remove your clothes .
or would you like us to do it for you?
stop !
let him go .
take me !
i am ready to redeem him .
you are ready to redeem him?
yes .
are you sure you understand what you 're taking upon yourself . . . . . . in doing this?
very well .
you are free .
but i warn you . . . . . . if you make any further inquiries . . . . . . or if you say a single word to anyone . . . . . . about what you have seen . . . . . . there will be the most dire consequences for you . . . . . . and your family .
do you understand?
what is going to happen to that woman?
no one can change her fate now .
when a promise has been made here . . . . . . there is no turning back .
go !
it's okay .
l 'm sorry .
l 'm sorry i woke you up , but i thought you were having a nightmare .
oh , god .
i just had such a horrible dream .
what time is it?
it's a little after 4 .
did you just get home?
it took longer than i thought .
you must be exhausted .
come on , lie down .
what were you dreaming?
just these weird things .
what was it?
it was so weird .
tell me .
we were in a deserted city . . .
. . . and our clothes were gone .
we were naked . . .
. . . and i was terrified . . .
. . . and i felt ashamed .
oh , god . . . .
and i was angry because i thought it was your fault .
you rushed away to go find clothes for us .
as soon as you were gone , it was completely different .
i felt wonderful .
then i was lying in a beautiful garden . . . . . . stretched out naked in the sunlight . . .
. . . and a man walked out of the woods .
he was the man from the hotel , the one i told you about .
the naval officer .
he stared at me . . .
. . . and then he just laughed .
he just laughed at me .
but that's not the end . . .
. . . is it?
why don't you tell me the rest of it?
it's too awful .
it's only a dream .
he was kissing me . . .
. . . and then we were making love .
then there were all these other people around us . . . . . . hundreds of them , everywhere .
everyone was fucking .
and then l . . . .
i was fucking other men .
so many . . .
. . . l don't know how many i was with .
and i knew you could see me in the arms of all these men . . .
. . . just fucking all these men .
i wanted to make fun of you . . .
. . . to laugh in your face .
and so i laughed as loud as i could .
that must have been when you woke me up .
shit !
i'll just have a cup of coffee , please .
anything else?
no , thank you .
excuse me .
do you know when they get in next door at the sonata caf?
i think there's usually someone in the office around 2 or 3 .
i don't suppose , by any chance , you know nick nightingale?
he's playing piano over there right now .
nick nightingale?
sure , he comes in here .
look , maybe you can help me . . . . . . because it's important that i get in touch with him .
do you know where he's staying?
i don't know if he'd want me to give out his address .
it's okay , l 'm a doctor .
l 'm actually an old friend of his .
well , doctor . . .
. . . he'll be playing there tonight .
can't it wait until then?
to be perfectly honest . . .
. . . it's a medical matter .
some tests .
i know he'll want to know about them as soon as possible .
excuse me .
hi !
how can i help you?
can you please ring mr. nightingale's room for me?
l 'm sorry , sir , mr. nightingale has already checked out .
he checked out?
did he leave a forwarding address?
no , l 'm afraid not .
when did he check out?
about 5 : 00 this morning .
5 : 00?
that's an early checkout , isn't it?
it is a little on the early side , yeah .
did you notice anything . . . . . . l don't know . . . . . . unusual about him when he left?
unusual?
hey , you 're not five o , are you?
no , l 'm an old friend of his .
really?
l 'm a doctor .
well , bill . . .?
sure .
it's funny you should ask that question , bill . . . . . . because there was something a little strange . . . . . . about the way mr. nightingale left .
really?
what was that?
he came in this morning , about 4 : 30 a . m . . . . . . with two men .
big guys .
they were very well dressed and very well spoken .
but they weren't the kind of people you'd fool around with . . . . . . if you know what i mean .
anyways . . .
. . . l noticed mr. nightingale had a bruise on his cheek .
to be perfectly honest , i also thought he looked a little scared .
scared?
he said he wanted to check out .
and then he went upstairs to his room with one of the men .
the other guy stayed down in the lobby and settled his bill .
when they came back , mr. nightingale tried to pass me an envelope .
but they saw it and took it . . . . . . and said that any mail or messages for him . . . . . . would be collected by someone properly authorized to do so .
and then they just took him off in a car .
do you have any idea where they went?
no , not a clue .
i certainly appreciate your help .
anytime , bill .
oh , the good doctor !
was your outfit a success?
yes , it was .
thank you .
good , good .
tuxedo .
cloak .
shoes .
i think you forgot the mask .
it's not there?
maybe you left it at the party?
i don't think so .
i must have lost it .
could you put it on the bill , please?
sure .
here we are .
that was 1 50 for the rental , 200 you said for my trouble . . . . . . 25 for the mask .
sorry . . . .
three hundred seventy five .
yes , dear?
come , come .
would you like to say hello to dr. harford?
thank you , mr. milich .
i'll call you soon .
goodbye , gentlemen .
merry christmas and happy new year !
and you too .
well , dr. harford . . .
. . . here is your receipt .
l 'm tearing up your deposits . . .
. . . and thanks for the business .
mr. milich , last night . . .
. . . you were going to call the police .
things change .
we have come to another arrangement .
and by the way , if the good doctor should ever want anything again . . . . . . anything at all . . . . . . it needn't be a costume .
come in .
tuna salad and black coffee .
thanks .
listen , how's my afternoon looking?
i think it's just mrs. akerly at 2 : 30 and mrs. kominski at 4 .
well , something's come up , and l 'm not going to be able to see them .
please ask dr. miller if he can fit them in .
otherwise , just apologize . . . . . . and make new appointments .
sure .
and please call the garage and have them get my car out in half an hour .
no problem .
any calls for me?
dr. sanders and mrs. shapiro .
hey , gang .
hi , daddy .
look , i got all these right .
you got all of those right?
every single one of them?
that's good .
you hungry?
sort of .
want to eat at 7?
seven?
listen , can we make that earlier?
i have some appointments at the office .
you have to go out again tonight?
l 'm afraid so .
daddy , am i gonna get a puppy for christmas?
we'll see about that , okay?
he could be a watchdog . . . .
we'll see .
come on , baby , let's finish this off .
all right , we have joe .
and joe has $2 . 50 .
and mike has $ 1 . 75 .
joe has how much more money than mike? $0 . 75?
so is it gonna be a subtraction or an addition?
how much more " means that it would be a subtraction .
yeah , because you 're going to be taking .
right .
and there were all these other people around us .
hundreds of them , everywhere .
everyone was fucking .
and then i ....
i was fucking other men .
so many ... ... i don't know how many i was with .
keep the change .
merry christmas .
what is it?
domino?
no , she's not in .
are you expecting her back soon?
no , l 'm not .
i have something for her .
can i leave this with you?
just a minute .
can i say who it's from?
well , just tell her it's from . . .
. . . bill .
you 're bill?
the bill?
you 're the doctor who was here last night?
well , i suppose i am .
domino said how nice you were to her .
did she?
why don't you come in for a second?
sure .
l 'm sally .
hello , sally .
so do you have any idea when you expect domino back?
i have no idea .
you have no idea?
to be perfectly honest , she may not even be coming back .
she may not even be coming back?
l . . . .
you . . .?
i think there's something that i should tell you .
really?
but i just don't know .
i don't know .
you don't know?
well , what is it?
i don't know whether to tell you this .
why don't you have a seat?
let's sit down .
i don't quite know how to say this .
you don't quite know how?
well , considering that you were with domino last night . . .
. . . l think it would be only fair to you to let you know . . .
. . . that she got the results of a blood test this morning . . . . . . and it was hlv positive .
hlv positive?
i am very , very sorry to hear that .
i mean , it's absolutely devastating .
listen , can i offer you anything?
a cup of coffee maybe?
no , thank you .
i think . . .
. . . maybe i'd better be going .
taxi !
off duty .
i'll just have a cappuccino , please .
i'll bring it over to you .
thank you .
good evening .
good evening .
l 'm dr. harford .
one of my patients was admitted this morning .
miss amanda curran .
could you please give me her room number?
certainly , doctor .
her name again?
curran .
amanda curran .
c u r r a n?
miss amanda curran?
that's right .
l 'm sorry , doctor .
miss curran died this afternoon .
she died this afternoon?
yes , at 3 : 45 p . m .
l 'm sorry .
because it could cost me my life ... ... and possibly yours .
yes , this is dr. harford .
tonight?
no , no , that's okay .
please tell him i'll be there in about 20 minutes .
come in .
bill , i appreciate you coming .
sorry to drag you out here .
let me have your coat .
i was out anyway .
thank you .
how about a drink?
are you having one?
sure .
what would you like?
just a little scotch .
good .
how do you take it?
neat?
please .
that was a terrific party the other night .
alice and i had a wonderful time .
well , good .
it was great seeing you both .
cheers .
were you playing?
no , i was just knocking a few balls around .
beautiful scotch .
that's a 25 year old .
i'll send you over a case .
no , please .
why not?
you feel like playing?
no , thanks .
you go ahead , i'll watch .
i was just . . . .
listen . . . .
the reason i asked you to come over is . . .
. . . l need to talk to you about something .
sure .
it's a little bit awkward .
and i have to be completely frank .
what kind of problem are you having?
it isn't a medical problem .
actually . . .
. . . it concerns you .
i know what happened last night .
and i know what's been going on since then .
and i think you just might . . .
. . . have the wrong idea about one or two things .
l 'm sorry , victor , l . . . .
what in the hell are you talking about?
please , bill , no games .
i was there .
at the house .
i saw everything that went on .
what the hell did you think you were doing?
i couldn't even begin to imagine . . .
. . . how you'd heard about it . . . . . . let alone got yourself through the door .
then i remembered seeing you with that prick piano player . . . . . . nick whatever the fuck his name was , at my party .
and it didn't take much to figure out the rest .
it wasn't nick's fault .
it was mine .
of course it was nick's fault .
lf he hadn't mentioned it to you , none of this would've happened .
i recommended that cocksucker to those people . . . . . . and he's made me look like a complete asshole .
what can i say?
i had . . .
. . . absolutely . . . . . . no idea you were involved in any way .
i know you didn't , bill .
but i also know that you . . . .
you went to nick's hotel this morning . . . . . . and talked to the desk clerk .
how do you know that?
because i had you followed .
you had me followed?
okay , okay , l 'm sorry .
all right?
i owe you an apology .
this was for your own good , believe me .
i know what the desk clerk told you .
but what he didn't tell you is . . . . . . all they did was put nick on a plane to seattle .
by now he's probably back with his family . . . . . . banging mrs. nick .
the clerk said he had a bruise on his face .
okay , he had a bruise on his face .
that's a hell of a lot less than he deserves .
i don't think you realize what kind of trouble you were in last night .
who do you think those people were?
those were not just ordinary people there .
lf i told you their names l 'm not gonna tell you their names . . . . . . but if i did , i don't think you'd sleep so well .
was it the second password?
ls that what gave me away?
yes , finally .
but not because you didn't know it .
it's because there was no second password .
of course it didn't help a whole lot that those people arrive in limos . . . . . . and you showed up in a taxi .
or that they found the receipt from the rental house in your coat . . . . . . made out to you know who .
there was a woman there . . .
. . . who tried to warn me .
i know .
do you know who she was?
she was a hooker .
sorry , but . . .
. . . that's what she was .
a hooker .
suppose i told you . . .
. . . that everything that happened to you there . . .
. . . the threats , the girl's warnings . . . . . . her last minute intervention . . . . . . suppose i said that all of that . . .
. . . was staged .
that it was a kind of charade .
that it was fake .
fake?
yes .
fake .
why would they do that?
why?
ln plain words . . . . . . to scare the living shit out of you .
to keep you quiet about where you'd been . . . . . . and what you'd seen .
have you seen this?
yes , i have .
i saw her body in the morgue .
was she the woman at the party?
she was .
the woman lying dead in the morgue . . .
. . . was the woman at the party .
well , victor , maybe l 'm missing something here .
you called it a fake , a charade .
do you mind telling me what kind of fucking charade . . . . . . ends with somebody turning up dead?
okay , bill , let's cut the bullshit .
all right?
you've been way out of your depth for the last 24 hours .
you want to know what kind of charade?
i'll tell you exactly what kind .
that whole play acted , " take me " phony sacrifice . . . . . . that you've been jerking off with had nothing to do with her real death .
nothing happened after you left that hadn't happened to her before .
she got her brains fucked out .
period .
when they took her home , she was just fine . . . . . . and the rest is in the paper .
she was a junkie .
she od'd .
there was nothing suspicious .
her door was locked from the inside .
the police are happy .
end of story .
come on .
it was always gonna be just a matter of time with her .
remember , you told her so yourself .
you remember , the one with the great tits who od'd in my bathroom?
listen , bill , nobody killed anybody .
someone died .
it happens all the time .
but life goes on .
it always does . . . . . . until it doesn't .
but you know that , don't you?
i'll tell you everything .
i'll tell you everything .
helena's gonna be up soon .
she's expecting us to take her christmas shopping today .
that's nice .
i could put sabrina in here .
it's really pretty .
it's old fashioned .
he's big .
i hope santa claus gets me one of these for christmas .
you do?
well , you 're gonna have to wait and see .
what do you think we should do?
what do i think we should do?
look , mommy !
what do i think?
i don't know .
i mean , maybe . . . .
maybe i think . . . . . . we should be grateful .
grateful . . . . . . that we've managed to survive through all of our . . . . . . adventures . . .
. . . whether they were real . . . . . . or only a dream .
are you sure of that?
am i sure?
only as sure as i am . . . . . . that the reality of one night . . .
. . . let alone that of a whole lifetime . . .
. . . can ever be the whole truth .
and no dream is ever . . .
. . . just a dream .
the important thing is . . .
. . . we 're awake now . . .
. . . and hopefully . . .
. . . for a long time to come .
forever .
forever?
forever .
let's not use that word .
you know?
it frightens me .
but i do love you . . .
. . . and you know . . .
. . . there is something very important . . . . . . that we need to do as soon as possible .
what's that?
fuck .
