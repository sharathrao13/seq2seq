the kingdom hospital rests on ancient marshland where the bleaching ponds once lay .
here the bleachers moistened their great spans of cloth .
the steam evaporating from the wet cloth shrouded the place in permanent fog .
centuries later the hospital was built here .
the bleachers gave way to doctors and researchers , the best brains in the nation and the most perfect technology .
to crown their work they called the hospital the kingdom .
now life was to be charted , and ignorance and superstition never to shake the bastions of science again .
perhaps their arrogance became too pronounced , and their persistent denial of the spiritual .
for it is as if the cold and damp have returned .
tiny signs of fatigue are appearing in the solid , modern edifice .
no living person knows it yet , but the gateway to the kingdom is opening once again .
thy kingdom come
good morning ...
my poor wee chap !
what's happened?
let me guess ...
oh my god !
your donald duck magazine hasn't arrived .
how the hell are you going to pass the time now?
oh , i'll find some jobs to do .
no , no , no panicky solutions .
where's the boss?
no idea .
of course not .
but the doctors car park is an earthquake zone .
it was a great experience .
we must find her again .
she needs me .
urgently .
where do you think you are going?
mrs drusse is in hospital .
ln the hospital , mrs drusse has a bed .
lt's in bed i want to see mrs drusse , and nowhere else .
consultant neurosurgeon hook told me i could walk about a bit .
wait ...
just who is consultant neurosurgeon hook?
him? ...
well i'll be damned .
you , a consultant neurosurgeon?
mrs drusse , you are seriously ill .
there's never been a body fluid count like yours ...
sister !
consultant neurosurgeon hook says give this patient a saline drip in her own bed .
a slow one .
helmer?
it is l .
your diplomacy didn't work .
mona's mother has complained .
a good thing you're in the lodge .
lots of the brethren are on the general medical council .
we'll discuss the complaint at morning conference .
it's better than letting rumours fly .
then it'll look as if i've found a few ways out but don't want to burden the staff .
that's a trick you could use .
they all think you're a bit harsh .
but i think the complaint will be of benefit to you here .
it'll make you seem more human .
what makes you like denmark , specially?
dr. helmer joined us two months ago , and we're proud to have this internationally acclaimed neurosurgeon here .
sadly , dr. helmer is already having to become acquainted with one of the less attractive areas of danish medicine , namely patient complaints .
as some of you recall problems arose in connection with an operation he performed on mona somethingorother just after he joined us .
a complaint has been lodged and i'd like to ask you all to give him your support .
ln this context i'd like to raise a minor problem to which i think it reasonable for the staff to propose solutions .
uncertainty has been expressed visavis working with dr. helmer .
stig may find it peculiar that we address such things together .
but if operation morning breeze is to justify its existence we must also let the morning air into our personal spheres .
perhaps you do things differently in sweden ...
yes .
oh .
any suggestions as to how to counter this uncertainty visavis working with dr. helmer?
yes?
communication .
splendid .
splendid .
communication ... does anyone else feel communication's the problem?
he never says anything , and when he does it's in swedish .
we probably can't solve the swedish problem right away .
let's hear what dr. helmer has to say .
what?
how do you feel we can improve communication with you?
how should i know?
would it help to call you stig?
be more personal?
excuse me , i have work to do .
operations , and other trivial tasks .
of course ...
1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ...
this plate is unclean .
the walls have been flaking .
can't you do something?
no , nothing .
oh , dear .
we'll have to wash them again .
it'll wash off easily .
there are other things that can't be washed off .
what do you mean?
blood?
some blood can be washed off and some blood cannot .
tell me , are you crazy?
no girl will ever be interested in anyone so childish .
poor sanne !
whatever were you thinking of?
i thought i knew you .
but you've got the charm of a turd .
you'd better put that head back where it came from .
of course .
good ... ...
not that it's my affair .
and i never want to see you again .
shove off .
i'll miss the operation .
professor bondo wants to see me .
oh .
did you screw up?
why?
well , he's summoned you , hasn't he?
run along , then .
i see you've asked to see me later , too .
can i go , too?
lf you want to be a doctor , you'll have to watch an operation .
what if i watched through the window?
to kind of get used to it?
why isn't the patient asleep?
hello .
may .
i am assisting here .
may "?
the patient reacts to anaesthesia .
this gentleman is going to hypnotise the patient .
it's so exciting !
the hell it is .
einar !
where are the funny noses?
what do you mean , stig?
you are a circus manager and we clowns want noses .
red ones , with elastic bands .
this clown appears in my theatre and says he has a job to do .
the hypnotist ... of course you should have been informed .
the patient reacts to anaesthesia .
rigmor can tell you more .
scruples about operating because of the mona complaint?
it's like riding . lf you fall , you get straight back on .
mona has got nothing to do with it .
i'm pleased to hear it .
but you must admit this is exciting .
hypnoanaesthesia !
purely scientifically ...
after all , it's related to your article in the lancet .
though you'd know that better than i do , since you wrote it .
by the way , have a handful of the morning breeze stickers you recommended i had printed .
they're super .
how are you?
where did you get to?
i've had work to do .
i'm tired of lying here .
a spirit is calling .
i must search .
there's nothing wrong with me .
you've changed your tune .
i can walk .
sad about the drip .
yes , if i didn't have a porter in the family .
relax , relax .
you are feeling drowsy .
ln a moment you won't be able to feel anything .
at first in your skin , then your whole head on the count of three ...
one ... two ... three .
scalpel .
by the way , i dropped into the clothes store .
pean .
it was very clear that you had borrowed a dressing gown .
dressing gowns are for the patients ... ... not the staff .
hand it back immediately .
ln sweden you'd have been given very short shrift .
do you understand?
i thought the patient was asleep .
he should have been .
whether my patient is under anaesthetic or not , whether he's under hypnosis or he has just been knocked out with a blunt instrument is totally irrelevant .
but he must keep his mouth shut .
relax , you feel marvellous .
all the pain has gone , everything is over .
come in , mogge .
i have good news and i have bad news .
the good news is that i have no proof .
the bad news is that if i get the slightest evidence
linking a certain stolen body part with your personage will result not only in your immediate expulsion but also to my calling the police .
i hope you have left no trace .
a pathologist is a blood hound by profession .
i have no more time for you .
real life has summoned me .
hello , my name is dr. bondo .
you are related to mr. zakariasen?
he's my husband .
this is our son .
i am not the doctor who treated your husband , i'm a pathologist .
i requested this interview .
are we to talk in front of him?
mrs. zakariasen , your husband cannot hear what we say .
what do you want to say?
new legislation requires that you consent to dissection .
what's a dissection?
he wants to cut daddy up , mum .
without autopsies we'd still be in the stone age .
dad is still alive .
or is that just a formality?
dissection would only take place after death .
would you mind telling us what your personal interests in this case are?
am i right in thinking they go beyond those of general medicine?
your father has a hepatoma .
i think my research has achieved important results , but for a decade i have had no specimen to work on .
i need your father's liver to conclude my research .
so your beautiful thoughts on benefiting humanity are more to do with your own career .
we can't really take your problem seriously .
i find your request rather distasteful .
my research may improve the treatment of hepatomas .
it might prevent others from suffering like this .
with one patient a decade
i doubt if society would pay for any new form of treatment .
nobody can argue that dissection doesn't make sense .
we're not arguing .
we're just saying no .
we'd like to be alone with dad now .
right .
will the junior registrar close him up?
didn't you hear me?
please close him up .
communication problems?
all right , put his lid on .
actually , communications aren't the problem .
the problem is qualifications , hook .
hook !
you ... you must always ... ... obey professor tribini .
professor tribini will count to three .
one , two , three and whoops !
all of a sudden you are a good doctor .
or what , hook?
he has withdrawn my funds for a phase contrast microscope .
he says savings must be made .
yet just look at the waste ...
listen carefully .
you can hear my voice .
ln a moment i'll count to three and you will wake up .
you will feel marvellous .
you'll feel no pain .
you'll feel marvellous .
you'll be yourself again .
i'll count slowly to three , and on three you'll wake up .
one , two ...
three .
now open your eyes slowly ...
i'd like to talk to the doctor who did the operation .
there was a girl ...
a girl?
yes .
a little girl .
she was kind .
i was upset , and she stroked my hand .
do you know her?
the doctor who's just gone out?
yes , that's judith .
the little girl pointed at her and said " family " .
family?
hi , bulder .
hi , drusse .
what are you up to?
looking for the ghost .
why not take bongo?
he howls when he hears that ambulance .
really?
i'm not taking a dog .
it's bad enough pushing my mum mile after mile .
you're a good boy , bulder .
i'm sick of pushing this bed about .
i've been pushing it all day .
and dogs aren't allowed here .
lf we push him round in this , nobody will ever know .
he's picked up the scent .
where are we now?
below m.
lnfectious medicine .
what now?
she's here .
hi , mogge .
did i miss a swedish screwup?
why do i suddenly like you? ...
what did you want?
you wanted guinea pigs for the sleep lab .
are you sure you'd want to?
it's heavy stuff .
we test new sleep control drugs .
ok by me .
you get 150 per sleep period .
we do an ecg to measure which brain centres are activated while you dream .
then you describe the process .
ok by me .
fine .
report to the cage .
you said helmer had taken away your microscope?
i can apply again next year .
that's crazy .
i think so , too .
i've a better idea .
where are we going?
i want to show you something .
everything looks fine .
the hypnoanaesthesia was apparently highly effective .
you say you didn't notice the operation , or any discomfort?
no discomfort .
but there was a little girl .
ln the operating theatre?
yes .
she tried to talk to the doctor doing the operation , but he wouldn't listen .
she tried to talk to helmer?
yes ... he wouldn't listen .
and i think i know why .
wouldn't listen to what?
her little bell .
why not?
because it was the death bell .
what bloody nonsense !
don't let it bother you .
i don't .
i take no notice of any of the nonsense here .
professor bondo just phoned .
he wants to address the lodge .
i'm trying to scrape some brethren together for tonight .
i can't take this damned crap .
her little bell !
the death bell !
pull in here .
hello , hook .
hi , hansen .
hi , bulder .
any news?
you've been for quite a walk with mrs. drusse .
that drip ran out hours ago .
bongo !
bongo !
come here !
dogs aren't allowed in hospitals !
this is where i live .
oh , you don't really .
yes , i do .
it's just practical .
most of my friends work down here .
ln the passageways and kitchens round about .
i like living here , don't get me wrong .
what if you get found out?
i have been .
we have a tacit agreement .
i fix things for the hospital and the hospital leaves me alone .
there's a lot of wastage , and that's not a good thing .
helmer said you'd stolen a dressing gown .
ls it anything to do with that?
it's an excellent example .
but he got it wrong .
it wasn't just one dressing gown .
it was hundreds .
dressing gowns were piling up at neurosurgery .
they took up room .
so i dealt with them .
how?
i redirect them .
redirect them?
to wards where they're needed .
lemon?
yes , please .
what's in it for you?
i don't get anything out of it .
i just don't like ...
i'm happy when things aren't wasted .
ethyl alcohol and distilled water .
the cleanest drink you can get .
per , this is hook .
at k5006 there's a whole pile of equipment .
will you look for ...
what was it you wanted?
a phase contrast microscope . ...
a phase contrast microscope .
hmm?
great .
see you later .
what's that?
hey , that's spooky !
maybe it is .
i got the idea from professor ulrich in gastrosurgery .
we all have own private cemetery " .
each tray represents one of the senior doctors here .
and each cross is a death?
not likely , or i'd be busy !
no , each cross represents a death or injury caused by medical negligence .
there's just not that number of mistakes reported .
reported , no , and i don't tell the world about it either .
but one day i might find a use for my knowledge .
that was quick , lads .
put it over here .
a present from the kingdom .
i begin to see how you got that tacit agreement ...
it'll soon be dark .
yes , evening is falling .
and when night comes , we shall sleep .
there's something i don't understand .
what don't you understand?
lf the little girl from the lift is kind and good , why does the old woman want to chase her away?
the little girl is unhappy .
she cannot rest .
we sleep when night falls .
she never sleeps .
oh?
she needs help so she can rest .
yes?
i wondered if you'd come and sit with mrs. mogensen?
she's such a sweet old lady , and she's interested in spiritualism .
you haven't heard ...
she had another turn this morning .
the doctor expects her to pass away tonight .
i am sorry .
i had such a nice time with mrs. mogensen .
she asked for you earlier , but you weren't in your room .
now she keeps slipping in and out of consciousness .
but i think she'd appreciate your company .
of course .
a cup of coffee?
no , thanks .
i'll stick to my crossword , even if i can't do it .
just ring if you are afraid .
my dear girl , i shan't be afraid .
i have sat with the dying before .
the jaw drops and that's that .
it can be very peaceful .
ls that you , mrs. drusse?
yes , it's me , emma .
where did you get to?
i was ghost hunting .
how i loved you , mrs. drusse !
and all your spirits .
all your zany spirits .
i have been very fond of you , too .
do they say i'm dying?
yes .
are you afraid?
a little .
don't be afraid , emma .
you're just passing over to all those zany spirits .
quite true .
it is a spiritualist's duty to die .
i'll be coming soon .
i'm an old biddy myself .
you aren't old .
stuff and nonsense .
but let's not argue , eh , emma?
eh , little emma?
i think i'll sleep a bit .
that's right , emma .
come on !
rigmor !
your tenderness ...
your tenderness , your warmth .
i don't deserve them .
you do , stig .
no .
i am a weakling .
but i can handle those thickheads .
even their moronic operation morning breeze .
but that mona business is getting to me .
because you are under pressure .
all men are under pressure .
but all you need is a woman to feed you well and give you some of the herbal remedies i've mentioned .
nietzsche lived off them , or at least wrote about them .
you are fantastic .
you exploit my weaknesses .
you do !
you are forcing your witchcraft on me .
first came a book about haiti .
then a trip to haiti i should treat you to .
stop putting up so much resistance .
i want to look after you .
you know i love you .
yes .
quietly does it !
stig ...
what's on your mind?
i'd like an honest answer ...
of course .
did you really say i had a backside like a chest of drawers?
who said that?
never you mind .
did you?
of course not .
good .
are you moving your things over?
eh?
hi , pop .
he's a good boy .
i told you to stay away .
the toothbrush isn't for you .
i've come to sleep .
don't be silly .
look at your papers .
ok .
but you'll have to sleep .
i'm not allowed to talk to the guinea pigs .
i've come to sleep , not talk .
fine .
change in there .
bondo ...
dear brethren ,
i have never previously exercised my right to convene you .
so you will understand the gravity of my problem .
you know i set great store by my research , despite the friendly teasing about my lack of hepatomas .
and that's the point .
after a ten year wait , a wonderful hepatoma has popped up .
the tumor will allow me to conclude my research but i can't have it !
the patient , who is on professor ulrich's ward , is dying .
but the family refuses to allow dissection .
there's nothing i can do .
so near , and yet so far !
i have a freeze dried sample , but i need the whole tumor .
to the very last i hoped that an operation would be performed thus placing the tumour in my hands .
i know it was wishful thinking , professor , for the tumor is inoperable .
but nevertheless ...
i no longer delude myself that a solution will appear from nowhere .
so i have convened you to ask for help .
help me to help medical science !
haven't you finished yet?
there .
i can't sleep .
don't worry , you will .
turn over .
goodnight .
ghost hunting ...
of course you've been ghost hunting !
did you speak , emma?
tell me about it ...
do tell ...
what shall i tell you?
we searched everywhere .
but she didn't reveal her presence everywhere .
to announce her presence she rings a little bell .
where?
where?
everywhere .
do you think it might be of some significance?
it was at gynaecology .
ward y.
and then at respiratory diseases ...
and on a ...
medicine .
you mustn't go , mrs. drusse .
i am right beside you , emma .
i think it will be soon .
ls there anything you want me to do , mrs. drusse on the other side?
yes , of course .
find my ghost , talk to her .
ask her why she is so unhappy and what i can do about it .
what's her name?
i don't know , but i expect you'll find her anyway .
ghosts are in the state in between .
ln swedenborg space .
but you won't stay there long , you will want to cross it into the light .
but try and stay there a couple of minutes .
they will call you from the light , and tug at you .
but try to delay your crossing and answer me , emma .
i'll do my best .
thank you , emma , you're very kind .
i'm not meant to tell you how the mona affair is progressing , but i got a furious letter from the chief medical officer today .
apparently the anaesthesia report was destroyed .
the cmo wants to see the anaesthetist's notes .
blood pressure , and so on .
that's the bad thing about being a manager .
what is the bad thing about being a manager?
management , damn it !
bondo is in a most unfortunate situation .
it would look good if you could help ...
me?
the lodge likes active brethren .
specially just after initiation .
poor bondo .
yes , poor chap .
i'm no psychiatrist , but anyone can see he is madly insane .
his speech is incoherent , he dribbles , yes , he's bonkers .
you mustn't say that , stig , you're a scientist yourself .
moreover , a brother's cry for help will always be heard however insignificant the matter may appear to be .
give bondo's problem some thought .
you're so creative , you nervous types .
the more you stand by bondo , the more the lodge will stand by you .
this is where we part .
you can find the lift again?
don't let the mona affair dent your good humour .
creative !
emma ...
keep listening , and i'll talk you through .
i am beside you .
let go , emma , but don't fall too far .
stay in the state in between !
stay in the state in between .
don't leave swedenborg space !
answer me ...
very good , emma .
we must hurry .
one flash , no .
two , don't know .
three , yes .
are they tugging at you from inside the light , emma?
ls it beautiful in the light?
we're wasting our time .
have you found her?
no?
you need a name?
really , emma?
ward y ...
and a ...
mary .
mary .
her name is mary , emma .
ls her name mary?
fine ! ls she with you?
no?
what shall i ask about , then?
where can i find out?
ls there anywhere?
but where , emma?
ln this hospital?
hold on , emma , hold on !
everything in this hospital has a number .
give me a number before you disappear ...
first digit 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 .
second digit , 1 , 2 , 3 .
third digit , 1 , 2 ... 532 ...
thank you , emma .
that was kind of you .
good evening .
can you tell me about mary?
no , i don't know anyone called mary .
whose is the other bed?
mrs. krger's .
she's in the pool .
they couldn't stand the way she went on pleading and pleading so they opened the pool , even though it was late .
but you won't get much out of talking to her .
she's completely gaga .
old and gaga ...
thanks .
goodnight .
who is mary?
my name's ellen .
daddy gave me a new dolly today .
how old are you , ellen?
nine .
do you know mary?
mary is ill .
she's in daddy's hospital .
she coughs .
her chest is poorly .
she has a hump .
mary has a hump .
what year is this?
1919 , of course .
lsn't dolly's hair lovely?
her name is mary , too .
it says " mary " here .
would you like to see my daddy?
he's a doctor .
yes , please .
the picture is under the pillow in the pram .
ls that you next to your father?
no , that's mary .
they wrote a song about her .
shall i sing it?
may i borrow your picture?
ln a ward in hospital
ln a white bed there
lay a little girl who coughed
sick and pale , with golden hair .
lay a little girl who coughed
sick and pale , with golden hair .
every heart she stole away
as she lay there sweet and good

stig?
hi .
where is the lift?
or the stairs?
say hello to my friend .
he spent his childhood in haiti .
he can tell you all about zombies .
he tends the animals .
lf i have to choose between zombies and the stairs ,
i'll take the stairs .
i had a nasty dream .
the questionnaire ...
i haven't time .
no money , then .
evening , madsen .
hello , bulder .
any activity?
no , it's been very quiet .
kingdom security here . ...
just a minute .
it's that call again !
record it , damn it !
this is stretcher van 12 .
we're heading down lyngby road towards the kingdom .
with horn and flashing lights ...
stretcher vans?
that was 100 years ago .
call the police .
those calls come every night .
bongo ...
bongo , nice doggy ...
bulder !
her name is mary .
mary .
a helping hand from copenhagen " .
last week professor aage krger returned to his home town to tell 6 year old mary jensen she could be treated free of charge at the kingdom .
mary is looking forward to visiting the capital .
here she thanks the professor ...
there's a photo of her .
mary had a little lamb ...
hello .
thanks for the microscope .
i'm not busy tonight .
i thought you would be , now you've got it .
what about that research?
i know i've been playing hard to get , and i do like you .
but i was in love with somebody else .
and ... now you're not?
i don't know .
he left a few months ago , i don't think he'll be back .
it's not a problem for me .
did you really think it would be?
it's not that simple .
i'm pregnant .
ok .
ls that good or bad?
good .
i want a baby .
his baby .
but i thought it might complicate things for you .
listen , sweetie .
i'm mad about you .
pregnant or not .
lf you have the baby , i'll love it , too .
you thought i wouldn't if it wasn't mine?
maybe i did .
what an idiot !
who?
the bloke who ran off and left such a lovely girl .
aage ...
yes .
aage .
what an arsehole !
what's the matter?
i went all dizzy .
of course , you're pregnant .
and i'd already forgotten .
lie down .
we must take your temperature .
because i'm pregnant?
some doctor !
be quiet , we can't be careful enough .
and it might go up a degree or two ...
our forests are fresh and big , cuckoo , cuckoo , faldera .

cuckoo , cuckoo , faldera .
they're not just idiots .
they're deadly dangerous .
danish scum .
bongo ...
lf mary's who we're looking for , where's her little lamb?
it's the dog .
well , that was part 2 of the kingdom .
i'd like to thank you again for watching our little series .
mrs. drusse continues to slavishly follow all the clues knowing they may lead her into trouble .
i am very happy with part 2 and i'd call it poetic and captivating .
maybe you think the story is predictable and depressing .
lf so , look at your own life .
ls it monotonous and humdrum?
yes?
then enjoy the comfort of the familiar .
but if your life is exciting , enjoy this break from the caviar with its view of the trivia you have surely out behind you .
my name is lars von trier and i wish you a very good evening .
should you wish to revisit the kingdom be prepared to take the good with the evil !
