good morning .
good morning .
here ye , here ye , 1 0 minutes to go till van dort's wedding rehearsal .
watch it !
it's a beautiful day it's a rather nice day
a day for a glorious wedding
a rehearsal , my dear to be perfectly clear
a rehearsal for a glorious wedding
assuming nothing happens that we don't really know
that nothing unexpected / nterferes with the show
and that's why everything every last little thing
every single , tiny , microscopic little thing must go
according to plan our son will be married
according to plan our family carried
elevated to the heights of society
to the costume balls / n the hallowed halls
rubbing elbows with the finest
having crumpets with her highness
we'll be there , we'll be seen having tea with the queen
we'll forget everything that we've ever , ever been
blimey !
it's my dress is caught .
begging your pardon , ma'am .
come on , dear .
it's not me .
it's my dress is caught .
where is victor?
we might be late .
fish merchants . / t's a terrible day now , don't be that way / t's a terrible day for a wedding / t's a sad , sad state of affairs we're in
that has led to this ominous wedding
how could our family have come to this?
to marry off our daughter to the nouveau riche
they're so common so coarse
oh , it couldn't be worse couldn't be worse? / 'm afraid / disagree
they could be land rich , bankrupt aristocracy
without a penny to their name
just like you and me
oh , dear .
and that's why everything every last little thing
every single , tiny , microscopic little thing must go
according to plan our daughter will wed
according to plan our family led
from the depths of deepest poverty
to the noble realm of our ancestry
and who would have guessed / n a million years
that our daughter with a face of an otter in disgrace
would provide our ticket to a rightful place
oh , hildegarde .
what if victor and i don't like each other?
as if that has anything to do with marriage .
do you suppose your father and i like each other?
surely you must a little?
of course not .
of course not .
get those corsets laced properly .
i can hear you speak without gasping .
you've certainly hooked a winner this time , victor .
now , all you have to do is reel her in .
i'm already reeling , mother .
shouldn't victoria everglot be marrying a lord or something?
oh , nonsense !
we're every bit as good as the everglots .
i always knew i deserved better than a fish merchant's life .
but i've never even spoken to her .
well , at least we have that in our favor .
mayhew !
silence that blasted coughing .
marriage is a partnership , a little tit for tat .
you'd think a lifetime watching us ....
might have taught her that
might have taught her that everything must be perfect
everything must be perfect everything must be perfect
perfect that's why everything
every last little thing
every single , tiny , microscopic little thing must go
according to plan
look at the way you're standing .
you look like you got rickets or something ....
oh , my goodness .
oh , such grandeur !
such impeccable taste !
oh , beautiful , innit?
it's not as big as our place , dear .
bit shabby really , isn't it?
shut up .
lord and lady everglot ... ... mr. and mrs. van dort .

yes , it's usually best .
do forgive me .
you play beautifully .
l l i do apologize , miss everglot .
how rude of me to well ....

mother won't let me near the piano .
music is improper for a young lady .
too passionate , she says .

yes , of course .
well ....

this day couldn't get any worse .
hear ye , hear ye !
rehearsal in ruins as van dort boy causes chaos !

with this candle , i will light your way in darkness .
with this ring ... ... l ask you to be mine .

a new arrival .
he must've fainted .
are you all right?
what?
what happened?
by jove , man .
looks like we've got ourselves a breather .
does he have a dead brother?
he's still soft .
a toast , then .
to the newlyweds .
newlyweds?
ln the woods , you said your vows so perfectly .
i did?
i did .
wake up !
wake up !
wake up !
coming through , coming through .
my name is paul , i am the head waiter .
i will be creating your wedding feast .
wedding feast !
i'm salivating .
maggots .
keep away !
i've got a i've got a dwarf .
and i'm not afraid to use him .
i want some questions .
now !
answers .
i think you mean " answers .
thank you , yes , answers .
i need answers .
what's going on here?
where am l?
who are you?
well , that's kind of a long story .
what a story it is .
a tragic tale of romance , passion ... ... and murder most foul .
this is gonna be good .
hit it , boys .
hey , give me a listen you corpses of cheer
at least those of you who still got an ear / 'll tell you a story make a skeleton cry
of our own jubiliciously lovely corpse bride
die , die , we all pass away
but don't wear a frown because it's really okay
you might try and hide and you might try and pray
but we all end up the remains of the day
that's right .
well , our girl was a beauty known for miles around
when a mysterious stranger came into town
he was plenty good looking but down on his cash
and our poor little baby she fell hard and fast
when her daddy said no she just couldn't cope
so our lovers came up with a plan to elope
die , die , we all pass away
but don't wear a frown because it's really okay
you might try and hide and you might try and pray
but we all end up the remains of the day
that's right .
okay .
oh , yeah .
come on , boys , pick it up .
yeah .
like it .
okay , chancy , take it .
yeah .
yeah !
that's nice .
so they conjured up a plan to meet late at night
they told not a soul kept the whole thing tight
now , her mother's wedding dress fit like a glove
you don't need much when you're really in love
except for a few things or so / 'm told
like the family jewels and a satchel of gold
then next to the graveyard by the old oak tree
on a dark foggy night at a quarter to 3
she was ready to go but where was he?
and then?
she waited and then?
there in the shadows , was it her man?
and then?
her little heart beat so loud and then?
and then , baby , everything went black
now , when she opened her eyes she was dead as dust
her jewels were missing and her heart was bust
so she made a vow lying under that tree
that she'd wait for her true love to come set her free
always waiting for someone to ask for her hand
then out of the blue comes this groovy young man
who vows forever to be by her side
and that's the story of our corpse bride
die , die , we all pass away
but don't wear a frown , because it's really okay
you might try and hide and you might try and pray
but we all end up the remains of the day
yeah .
victoria , come away from the window .
oh , i'm sure he'll be back shortly .
he's terrified of the dark .
ln fact , when he was a boy ... ... he used to wet his combinations regularly , didn't he , william?
enter .
lord barkis .
i trust the room is to your liking .
thank you , you are a most gracious hostess .
which is why it pains me to be the bearer of such bad news .
would you care to repeat tonight's headline for us?
hear ye , hear ye ! victor van dort seen this night on the bridge in the arms of a mystery woman !
the dark haired temptress and master van dort slipped away into the night !
and now , the weather .
scattered showers
enough !
that will be all .
mystery woman?
he doesn't even know any women !
or so you thought .
do call for me if you need my assistance ... ... in any way .
good heavens , finis , what should we do?
fetch me musket .
william , do something .
the town crier probably just had a slow news day .
you know how it is , you need a little something to cry about .
regardless , we are one groom short for the wedding tomorrow .
not to mention the financial implications .
a most scandalous embarrassment for us all .
oh , give us a chance to find him , we beg of you .
just give us until dawn . very well .
till dawn . victor , darling , where are you? / f you ask me , your boyfriend is kind of jumpy ,
he's not my boyfriend , he's my husband . victor , where have you gone?
i'll keep an eye out for him . victor?
there he goes , there he goes !
he's he's getting away !
quick , quick , after him ! victor .
thank you . victor !
where are you?
victor?
where have you gone?
married , huh?
i'm a widow .
oh , how rude .
he went that way !
victor .
victor , darling .
please .
there's been a mistake .
i'm not dead .
excuse me .
excuse me .
excuse me .
excuse me .
thank you .
thank you . victor .
dead end . victor !
hello !
could have used the stairs , silly .
lsn't the view beautiful?
it takes my breath away .
well , it would if i had any .
lsn't it romantic?
look , i am terribly sorry about what's happened to you ... ... and i'd like to help , but i really need to get home .
this is your home now .
but i don't even know your name .
well , that's a great way to start a marriage ,
shut up !
it's emily .
emily .
oh , i almost forgot .
i have something for you .
it's a wedding present .
thank you .
scraps?
scraps !
my dog , scraps !
oh , scraps , what a good boy .
i knew you'd be happy to see him .
who's my good boy?
sit .
sit , scraps , sit .
good boy , scraps .
roll over .
roll over .
good boy , scraps .
play dead .
sorry .
oh , what a cutie .
you should have seen him with fur .
mother never approved of scraps jumping up like this .
but then again , she never approved of anything .
do you think she would have approved of me?
you're lucky you'll never have to meet her .
well , actually ... ... now that you mention it , i think you should .
ln fact , since we're , you know ... ... married , you should definitely meet her .
and my father too .
we should go and see them right now .
what a fantastic idea !
where are they buried?
what?
what is it?
they're not from around here .
where are they?
oh , they're still alive .
i'm afraid so .
well , that is a problem .
what's that , scraps?
oh , no , we couldn't possibly .
oh , well , if you put it like that .
what?
elder gutknecht .
scraps .
elder gutknecht ... ... are you there?
hello? ls anyone home?
hello?
there you are !
oh , my dear .
there you are .
i've brought my husband , victor .
what's that?
husband?
pleasure to meet you , sir .
we need to go up .
upstairs?
to visit the land of the living .
land of the living?
oh , my dear .
please , elder gutknecht .
now , why go up there , when people are dying to get down here?
sir , i beg you to help .
it means so much to me
us .
i don't know , it's just not natural .
please , elder gutknecht .
surely there must be something you can do .
let me see what i can do .
where did i put that book?
i left it here somewhere .
there's the one .
i have it .
a ukrainian haunting spell .
just the thing for these quick trips .
so glad you thought of this .
me too .
now , then ... ... where were we?
the ukrainian haunting spell?
here we have it .
ready?
just remember , when you want to come back , say " hopscotch .
hopscotch?
that's it .
i spent so long in the darkness ... ... l'd almost forgotten how beautiful the moonlight is .
hey , i think you dropped something .
hold on , hold on .
i think i should prepare mother and father for the big news .
i'll go ahead and you ... ... wait here .
perfect .
i won't be long .
stay right here .
i'll be right back .
okay .
no peeking .
lf ever i see that van dort boy ... ... l'll strangle him with my bare hands .
your hands are too fat , and his neck is too thin .
you'll have to use a rope .
this is the voice of your conscience , listen to what / say , / have a bad feeling about that boy , you know he is no
go chew someone else's ear for a while . victor has gone to see his parents , just like he said .
lf i hadn't just been sitting in it , i would say that you had lost your mind !
i'm sure he has a perfectly good reason for taking so long .
i am sure he does .
why don't you go ask him?
all right , i will .
after all , he couldn't get far with those cold feet .
victoria . victor?
i'm so happy to see you .
come by the fire .
where have you been?
are you all right?
l l
oh , dear .
you're as cold as death .
what's happened to you?
your coat . victoria , i confess .
this morning i was terrified of marriage .
but then , on meeting you , i felt i should be with you always ... ... and that our wedding could not come soon enough .
victor , i feel the same .
victoria , i se i se
i seem to find myself married .
and you should know it's unexpected .
my darling , i just wanted to meet
darling?
who's this?
who is she?
i'm his wife .
victor? victoria , wait .
you don't understand .
she's dead .
look .
hopscotch .
no !
no ! victoria !
you lied to me !
just to get back to that other woman .
don't you understand?
you're the other woman .
no !
you're married to me .
she's the other woman .
she's got a point .
and i thought ....
i thought this was all going so well .
look , i'm sorry , but ... ... this just can't work .
why not?
it's my eye , isn't it?
no .
your eye is ... ... lovely .
listen , under different circumstances , well , who knows?
but we're just too different .
i mean , you're dead .
you should've thought about that before you asked me to marry you .
why can't you understand?
it was a mistake .
i would never marry you .
roses for eternal love .
lilies for sweetness .
baby's breath .
why so blue?
maybe he's right .
maybe we are too different .
maybe he should have his head examined ,
i could do it .
or perhaps he does belong with her .
little miss living .
with her rosy cheeks and beating heart .
oh , those girls are ten a penny .
you've got so much more .
you've got you've got
you've got a wonderful personality .
what does that wispy little brat have that you don't have double?
she can't hold a candle to the beauty of your smile
how about a pulse?
overrated by a mile
overvalued overblown / f he only knew the you that we know
and that silly little creature / sn't wearing his ring
and she doesn't play piano or dance , or sing
no , she doesn't compare
but she still breathes air who cares?
unimportant overrated
overblown / f only he could see
how special you can be / f he only knew the you that we know
/ f / touch a burning candle / can feel no pain / f you cut me with a knife / t's still the same
and / know her heart is beating
and / know that / am dead
yet the pain here that / feel
try and tell me it's not real
and it seems that / still have a tear to shed
the sole redeeming feature from that little creature / s that she's alive
overrated overblown
everybody knows that's just a temporary state
which is cured very quickly when we meet our fate
who cares?
unimportant
overrated overblown / f only he could see how special you can be / f he only knew the you that we know
/ f / touch a burning candle / can feel no pain / n the ice or in the sun / t's all the same
yet / feel my heart is aching
though it doesn't beat , it's breaking
and the pain here that / feel
try and tell me it's not real / know that / am dead
yet it seems that / still have some tears to shed
it's true , mother ! victor is married to a dead woman .
i saw her .
a corpse !
standing right here with victor . victor was in your room?
i have to help him .
the scandal !
come sit in your chair , dearie .
you're shaking like a leaf .
let hilde fetch you a blanket .
fetch her a straitjacket !
she's completely mad !
come , hildegarde .
finis , come to bed at once .
what in heaven's name?
who could that be at this hour?
miss everglot .
what are you doing here?
you should be at home , prostrate with grief .
pastor galswells , i have to ask you something .
this is most irregular .
please , i beg of you .
you are the only one in the village who knows of what awaits beyond the grave .
a grim topic for a bride to be .
can the living marry the dead?
what on earth are you speaking about?
please , it's victor .
he's married to a corpse .
he has a corpse bride !
there must be some way to undo what's been done .
i believe i know the thing to do .
come with me .
victoria?
where are your corsets?
she's speaking in tongues .
of unholy alliances .
her mind has come undone , i fear .
it's not true !
let me go !
let me go !
thank you , pastor galswells .
thank you so very much .
take her to her room !
no , i'm telling the truth . victor needs my help .
hildegarde , you believe me , don't you?
mother , father , please .
seal the doors ... ... and bar the windows .
see to it that she doesn't escape again .
he needs our help !
oh , let me go !
let me go !
will the mortification never cease?
it will be years before we can show ourselves in public again .
what shall we do?
we shall continue as planned , with or without vincent . victor .
whatever .
for that boy to toss aside a young woman like victoria ... ... it's positively criminal .
why , if i had a woman like your daughter on my arm ... ... l would lavish her with riches befitting royalty .
your lady wife is a most fortunate woman .
alas , i am not married .
i was betrothed some years ago ... ... but tragedy snatched my young bride away .
when one lives alone , wealth counts for naught .
marvelous news , victoria , there'll be a wedding after all .
you found him?
make haste , my dear , our relatives will arrive at any moment .
we must have you looking presentable for lord barkis .
lord barkis?
he will make a fine husband .
aye .
a fortuitous turn of events indeed .
a far better prospect this time .
but i do not love him .
you cannot make me do this .
we must .
please , i beg of you .
there must be another way .
without your marriage to lord barkis ... ... we shall be forced , penniless , into the street .
we are destitute .
but victor .... victor van dort has gone , child .
you shall marry lord barkis tomorrow .
according to plan .
according to plan .
oh , my dear .
oh , don't look at me that way .
you have only to suffer this union until death do us part .
and that will come sooner than you think .
oh , it's almost dawn !
where could he be? victor van dort elopes with corpse !
heartbroken bride to wed wealthy newcomer !
wealthy newcomer?
it cannot be .
did he say corpse?
oh , don't be ridiculous .
what corpse would marry our victor?
oh , mayhew !
silence that blasted coughing .
mayhew , are you trying to kill us?
i think he's trying to kill us .
i ... ... think you dropped this .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry i lied to you about wanting to see my parents .
it's just this whole day hasn't gone quite , well ... ... according to plan .
pardon my enthusiasm .
i like your enthusiasm .
new arrival !
new arrival !
lights up !
hurry up , boys !
drinks for everyone .
another pint , sir?
no , no .
just a half .
no , no .
just a half .
it is impossible to get good help anymore .
welcoming committee , coming through !
coming through !
my name's plum .
miss plum .
mayhew?
mayhew !
how nice to see
i'm so sorry .
oh , yeah .
actually , though , i feel great .
hurry up , boys .
can you not see the gentleman is parched?
mayhew , i have to get back .
they all must be worried sick .
how is everyone?
well , they're still wondering where you slipped off to .
oh , and miss victoria ....
yes?
yes , how is she?
well , she's getting married this evening .
what?
married to who?
some newcomer , lord somebody or other .
but that's impossible !
yeah , with you gone and all ....
i guess they didn't wanna waste the cake .
but how could she?
women , you can't live with them .
you can't live with
time to pick up the pieces and you know , and move on , i suppose .
speaking of picking up the pieces?
victor?
where are you going?
miss victoria , we must leave for the church now .
yesterday i thought my wedding would be happy .
now i feel like i'm caught in the tide , pulled out to sea .
the sea leads to many places , dearie .
maybe you'll land somewhere better .
with this candle , i will light your way in darkness .
with this ring , i ask you to be mine .
i now pronounce you man and wife .
oh , oh , dear .
i'm too late .
oh , mrs. plum , what am i to do?
he just walked off without saying a word .
are all men like this?
well , i'm afraid none of them are very bright .
they get something stuck in their heads ... ... and you can't do a thing with them .
my dear , we have to talk .
let me tell her , please .
let me tell her .
what?
there is a complication with your marriage .
i don't understand .
the vows are binding only until death do you part .
what are you saying?
death has already parted you .
lf he finds out , he'll leave .
there must be something you can do .
well , there is one way .
oh , please , please , let me tell her .
it requires the greatest sacrifice .
go on , get to the good part .
what is it?
we have to kill him !
what? victor would have to give up the life he had forever .
he would need to repeat his vows in the land of the living ... ... and drink from the wine of ages .
poison !
this would stop his heart forever .
only then would he be free to give it to you .
i could never ask him .
you don't have to .
i'll do it .
my boy , if you choose this path ... ... you may never return to the world above .
do you understand?
i do .
gather round .
gather round , everybody .
we've decided to do this thing properly .
so grab what you can and follow us .
we're moving this wedding party upstairs .
upstairs?
i didn't know we had an upstairs .
sounds creepy .
let's go !
a wedding , a wedding we're going to have a wedding
hold on , victor .

to make it the perfect day she's always dreamed
our hopes and our pride our bride , our lovely bride
we're going to have a party like nobody's ever seen
the living in the land above will not know where they've been
the land above the party of the bride
here comes the bride on this glorious day of days
up to the land of the living
to celebrate
