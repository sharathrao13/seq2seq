in 1944 swedish housewives and home economics teachers established
the home research institute , hfl .
here scientists perform experiments on kitchen equipment and methods .
kitchen machines and tools are tested in the institute's laboratory .
the purpose is to develop new and improved products ,
and better working conditions .
this potato peeler is made of stainless steel
and can be used both right and left handed .
the dish drying rack is both hygienic and functional .
the next study involves the kitchen habits of single men in norway ...
did it break again?
swedish piece of shit .
kitchen stories
are you all right?
it just felt so wrong to drive on the right hand side .
as if all my innards were being yanked over to the left .
in nards?
yes , innards .
i've crisscrossed sweden for years and never had a problem .
but as soon as i crossed the border and switched sides , i got sick .
but i tried to stay on the left as much as possible to avoid vomiting .
one more time .
and how is isak?
he sure regrets joining that swedish research project .
don't move .
it can't hurt for him to meet some new people .
i have trouble getting him in here .
i can imagine .
you're fit as a fiddle .
disappointed?
let the swedish camping season begin .
here he comes .
not likely .
do you have a wrench , green?
no .
is it the fan belt?
yes .
it seems loose .
there you are , malmberg .
remember to switch to the right?
no problem .
every one's ready for you .
we have problems on the eastern front .
it's those damn finns again .
you'll have to get things started here .
but i can't be responsible for ...
sure you can .
you've heard me do it hundreds of times before .
let me take care of this first .
go grab another drink .
tell adolfsson that i've flown to finland to clear things up .
we'll talk later this week .
if mrner calls , don't mention a word about the finns .
sixten?
i'll see to it that your application goes through this time .
you'll do just fine .
let's go .
thank you to the norwegian house wives 'association .
and now dr. malmberg , leader of the swedish observers .
i would like to thank the mayor of landstad .
i am not actually a doctor yet .
but in dr. ljungberg's absence
i shall do my best  to give you a short briefing on this study .
could miss deinboll please help out with the balopticon again?
this sketch shows the swedish house wife's movements
in the kitchen o ver a six week period .
the thicker the line , the heavier the traffic .
and so on .
through gleaning information from our research ,
we have managed to rationalize the kitchen
and the placement of the stations here indicated .
sink , towel , waste , kneading trough , and table .
the swedish house wife needs no longer walk to congo
during a year of cooking .
now northern italy will suffice .
but we have not come here to study the house wife's situation ,
but the movements of single males in the kitchen .
all our observers are of course bound by professional secrecy .
the observer will live in his own trailer ,
next to the house he is observing .
i would again like to emphasize that the key to this study's success
is that the observers be allowed to come and go as they please .
they must not be spoken to .
and must never be included in daily chores and routines .
no matter how tempting that may be .
the man who lived on that farm ...
he was killed by the train .
what?
his tractor stalled on this crossing .
what?
you have to be careful here .
i can't hear you .
be careful here .
isak?
isak?
open up .
isak .
why doesn't he open the door?
he regrets joining the project .
just be patient .
they were out of prim , isak .
isak bjrvik?
can you hear me?
my name is sixten malmberg .
i represent the swedish observers .
come out so we can discuss this .
hello?
there's alway s one like him .
he can't be any worse than that lady in alingss .
he'll give in eventually .
isak , are you there?
stop being so stubborn .
it's not good for you .
make sure you come in for a checkup before christmas .
he'll be out .
just give him time .
if he doesn't open up by tomorrow , you'll have an early christmas , folke .
can't you find me a new host?
these were the only volunteers .
i had to go all the way to town for that filter .
but without it , the tractor won't stop leaking .
well , i guess it's time to head home .
i guess you're right .
he never cooks in the kitchen?
no .
he'll eat porridge or bread down there from time to time .
but i think he prepares most of his food upstairs in his bedroom .
i smell cooking from upstairs .
does he have a stove in his bedroom?
i don't know .
i've never been up there .
of course you haven't .
do you know what prim is?
no .
why?
i was just curious .
so he never uses the kitchen stove?
at least not while i'm there .
interesting .
i wonder what dr. ljungberg will have to say about this .
i was wondering ...
since things are progressing so slowly here ...
perhaps i could change host?
change host?
i'm not making any progress here .
we can't have every one changing hosts all the time .
you understand , don't you , nilsson?
yes , sure .
i was just wondering .
hang in there .
i'll drop by again in a couple of days .
could you mail this for me?
it's for my aunt .
more baltic herring?
i hope so .
yes ...
same as always?
what else?
i just wanted to be sure .
you can never be sure .
no ...
not my nose .
that's it .
want the hair?
of course .
need a bag?
no , i'll just stick it in my pocket .
how's your horse , isak?
we're fine , thanks .
hello?
hello .
have you observed isak today?
no .
why won't you get better?
time for coffee .
thank you .
hi .
have you started smoking count hamilton?
you used to pick on dr. benjaminsen for smoking swedish tobacco .
i just bought a pack for folke .
folke?
i was heading to the store any way , so ...
well , i'd best be heading home .
but you're from stockholm , aren't you?
yes .
but i was born in malm .
i see .
that's way down south in sweden , isn't it?
yes .
down in skne .
carolus linnaeus was from smland .
you don't say?
that isn't far from skne .
my father used to talk a lot about carolus linnaeus .
my mother once told me that we were distantly related to linnaeus .
really?
so your name is folke linnaeus?
no , it was on my mother's side .
but her maiden name wasn't linnaeus either , it was rosenqvist .
rosenqvist ...
that sounds like a flower , too .
yes , it does .
would you want to be a football referee , grant?
i'd like to be a linesman , but it's such a hassle .
not only do you have to know the rules ,
you have to be able to interpret them .
exactly .
your lungs look just fine .
i don't care , as long as you stay away from team handball .
handball?
never .
i mean , who the hell remembers a single handball goal?
what did i say about your lungs?
they looked good .
folke nilsson?
package for you .
thank you .
so you're the mailman as well?
yep .
do many planes land here in landstad?
nah ...
i'd better be off .
smor gas .
you swedes sure have strange words for things .
you sure you don't want some?
positive .
help yourself .
how are things going here?
fine , thank you .
we need to discuss something .
an awkward situation has arisen at green's house .
he and his host have started drinking together .
the entire study may be in jeopardy .
i've never completely trusted him ,
but i never thought he would go this far .
if he wasn't dr. ljungberg's cousin i would have sent him home ages ago .
the question is ,
would you take over for green and clear up this problem?
you had requested a host switch .
since things were progressing so slowly here .
but things have started happening here now .
if it's all the same to you , i'd rather not switch .
why don't you ask ekdahl?
ekdahl has his own host .
that doesn't solve anything .
let's just hope green gets his act together .
i won't disturb you anymore .
since things are going so well here .
enjoy your meal , bjrvik .
thank you .
next week i have to take a bath .
indeed .
folke?
folke .
green?
were you asleep?
it is the middle of the night ...
tor and i are in a bit of a pinch .
tor?
my host .
we're all out of booze .
you wouldn't happen to have any liquor to lend us?
we aren't allowed to drink on the job .
not allowed to drink , not allowed to talk ...
shit , folke , what the hell are we doing?
we sit up there on our pedestals and think we understand everything .
how can we think we can understand anything about people
simply by observing them?
that's the nature of our research .
we have to talk to each other .
people have to communicate .
don't you at least have some beer?
our research is based on a positivistic approach .
positivistic?
i've decided to quit .
that's the most positivistic thing i can do .
you're contractually bound to stay until christmas .
have you talked to malmberg?
just a couple of beers ...
no .
come on ...
no , green .
shit !
i thought i could talk to you .
stupid idiot .
observe yourself , for christ's sake .
wait , green .
i have also talked ...
i have also talked ...
to my host .
green is right .
how can we understand each other without communicating?
it's grant .
he's coming over for coffee .
why don't you and grant ever speak on the phone?
do you know how expensive it is?
43 re a minute .
need i say more?
are you planning on sitting over there?
i was just talking to folke .
oskar's observer couldn't take it anymore .
he asked oskar why he opens his beer at two minutes to five every day .
it'll be five be fore you know it , " oskar responded .
it'll be five be fore you know it .
well , i should be heading over to the store .
don't forget your gloves .
it'll be five be fore you know it .
i'm having more and more trouble boiling my potatoes properly .
i wonder what it must be like for people with nuclear power .
that's a good point .
but nuclear power is supposed to be very stable .
yes , i suppose it is .
but isn't electricity electricity?
whether it comes from nuclear power or water power?
electricity is electricity?
no way .
you can't simplify it like that .
but you don't boil potatoes very often .
even though you have two stoves .
no , at least not as long as i'm being observed .
but you swedes don't understand that .
you were neutral observers during the war , too .
you're right .
unfortunately .
whatever .
let's drop that subject .
our death is predetermined .
my father used to say that .
why didn't grant want to take part in the study?
grant?
are you crazy?
then why did you volunteer?
they said that every one who signed up would get a horse .
a horse?
yes , a dla horse .
dala horse .
and you did .
that wasn't a real horse .
no .
it wasn't .
but you already have a horse .
that i do .
is this really necessary?
do you want to get well , or not?
yes .
then you have to wear that catskin .
lie down here .
horses are nice , but i'm not crazy about cats .
this has nothing to do with cats .
are you comfortable?
yes .
see you tomorrow then .
good night .
nilsson?
and where might i find nilsson?
nilsson?
folke nilsson .
oh , folke .
he went to the store to buy tobacco .
his car is still here .
his car?
grant gave him a ride .
my neighbor .
did you get your tobacco , nilsson?
tobacco?
what the hell is that around your neck?
a shawl .
with a tail?
yes , with a tail .
any way , your pay checks have been delayed , but they are on their way .
dr. ljungberg is flying in this afternoon .
bjrvik was asleep in your chair .
oh shit .
that's putting it mildly .
whey cheese .
what?
prim is a whey cheese .
i see .
i dream of a bride dressed in white .
no way .
now that you mention it , i've never cared much for swans , either .
swans?
white swans .
have you ever had a good relationship with a swan?
no , i can't say that i have .
exactly .
no , i prefer wolves and bears .
have you ever tasted bear meat?
no .
me neither .
but i hear it tastes like beef .
no .
grant has tasted it many times .
he says it tastes like a cross between moose and grouse .
i'm ready to get out now .
could you please turn off the light?
could you hand me that towel?
wait .
you have to hear this .
listen to my mouth when i open it .
your mouth?
all right .
what is that?
radio .
sometimes i pick up foreign stations too .
especially when it's dark , and i hold the water pipe at the same time .
i think it's because i have a lot of silver fillings .
and the water pipes are copper .
listen .
no one knows the whereabouts of dr. ljungberg?
he's still in finland , but it's impossible to reach him .
he can't just disappear like that .
he's still sweden's leading home scientist .
ny lander had to drive all the way from stockholm with your pay checks .
they didn't dare send the checks by mail this close to christmas .
does he still drive a neckar?
they are considering a switch to right hand driving at home .
it's crazy .
imagine the cost .
to move all the signs , bus doors ...
chaos .
imagine waking up and having to drive on the wrong side of the road .
le t hand driving is much safer than right hand .
that's scientifically proven .
but no one seems to care about such things anymore .
any way , here's your pay check .
otherwise things seem to be going well here .
not too well , i hope?
no .
just well .
does he cook in the kitchen yet?
no .
but he uses the kitchen for many other things .
i don't doubt it .
i have heard similar strange stories from the other observers .
i wonder how the standard kitchen will look for these people .
that will be a hard nut for dr. ljungberg to crack .
whenever he returns .
by the way , have you seen green?
no ...
i was going to fire him , but now i can't find him .
and all he talks about is this folke .
what's so special about him?
that's hard to say .
but they'll be leaving soon , any way .
not soon enough .
do you talk?
me and isak?
of course .
isak and you .
i don't know ...
i'd like him to come in for a checkup ,
but it seems impossible .
i'm concerned about him .
could you try to talk to him?
i'm the last person he'd listen to .
happy birthday .
thank you .
how did you know it was today?
it was in the information sheet i was given .
the information sheet .
of course .
i haven't celebrated my birthday since i was a young boy .
about time , then .
but i go to oskar's every year .
that isn't quite the same , is it?
no , i guess not .
although he serves layer cake , too .
good?
yes .
stand up for a second , isak .
bourbon .
cheers .
cheers .
why did grant take his hair , after you had cut it?
he repairs dolls .
something he learned in a concentration camp during the war .
i've heard that a year in prison is longer in sweden than in norway .
even if you've been convicted of the same crime .
that doesn't seem fair .
no , it doesn't .
but it wasn't fair for grant to get lock ed up , either .
more?
yes , thank you .
christ , that was a lot of pepper .
you have a whole room full of pepper .
dad bought it cheap from melchior the merchant during the war .
he was a jew who had to escape to sweden .
but supposedly it was a good investment .
grant says i could sell that pepper any time , and make good money .
they call it the king of spices .
cheers .
you seem to enjoy sitting up there .
yesterday was my birthday .
happy birthday .
where the hell is nilsson?
did he run out of tobacco again?
no .
he was just here .
i think .
he isn't in his trailer .
you wait here .
i'll go look for him .
folke?
isak?
is that where you are?
i looked all over for you .
what are you doing in there?
i should have told you earlier .
but the timing was never right .
what?
i drilled a little hole in the floor so that i could look into the kitchen .
what?
i did it back in the beginning .
is it any better that you observe me?
i couldn't find him .
but he can't be far off , because he was just here .
he was just here "?
what is the meaning of this?
what the hell are you up to?
who is observing who here?
nilsson wasn't feeling well .
i just wanted to help him .
does he realize what he is doing to me?
as soon as you find nilsson ,
tell him to come to my office immediately .
tell him it's regarding his return to sweden .
he'll understand .
these go with me .
shit !
what could he say?
he found the observations you made of me .
but those notes were my fault .
it isn't your fault that i observe too .
did you find it interesting to observe me through that hole?
i have apologized for that , folke .
can't you at least go in and talk to malmberg?
what's the point?
i'll get fired either way .
what are you going to do?
i'll be all right .
maybe you could stay for christmas .
that would be nice .
since you don't have a job any way .
thank you , but i don't think that would be possible .
you probably have family to spend christmas with .
not exactly .
except for my old aunt .
the one that sends all the food .
what the hell .
why not?
everything's gone to hell any way .
what do you normally eat?
herring , of course .
and jansson's temptation .
pigs 'feet , christmas ham , and lute fisk .
and bread and grease .
bread and grease?
actually , they mostly eat that up north .
not where i come from .
green , red , and brown cabbage ...
so this is where you are hiding .
didn't you get the message to come to my office?
yes .
but you didn't come?
no .
i have decided to resign .
there's no need .
you're already fired .
i'm going to stay here through christmas .
what?
i'm staying through christmas .
you are contractually bound to return your trailer to sweden .
your business here is not over .
where the hell did he come from?
our death is predetermined , right , isak?
yes , it is .
i don't know what to do anymore .
from his muzzle .
yes , blood too .
if that's what's best for him .
thank you .
what the hell are you doing , nilsson?
who is going to return your trailer now?
i sure as hell am not .
do you hear me?
answer me , folke .
folke .
shit !
stop , folke .
folke .
stop .
i'll have you blacklisted .
blacklisted .
what the hell are you staring at?
malmberg .
where the hell are you?
torsten , don't you get it?
we're too late .
they left hours ago .
come on .
let's go .
dr. ljungberg .
where's malmberg?
they left earlier .
dr. malmberg left behind some observation notes .
doctor?
yes .
dr. malmberg .
and you're telling me they've already left?
thank you .
green .
i have some observations here that should interest you .
he's hit on something essential here .
these are folke's notes .
folke has been observed .
let's weigh anchor .
somebody has observed folke .
isak?
isak?
nick norris
