i thought i might find work here .
well , it's very difficult to obtain a work permit in isthmus .
it's ...
well , one has to show a special talent that people here don't have .
well , that shouldn't be too difficult .
senor bond , you've got big cojones .
you come here , to my place , without references , ... .. carrying a piece , throwing around a lot of money .
but you should know something .
nobody saw you come in , ... .. so nobody has to see you go out .
senor sanchez , i could be very useful to a man in your position .
and i understand you have a reputation for rewarding loyalty very well .
i'll keep this for a few days .
we'll talk again .
and you won't need a gun in isthmus .
it's a very safe city .
in the meantime , i welcome you to the casino at all times .
check him out .
so what did you find out?
there's two inches of armoured glass .
i'd need a cannon to get to him .
ah , senor bond .
you will be pleased to know your uncle has arrived .
i put him in your suite .
thank you .
good night .
your uncle?
let's make this a proper family reunion .
give me your gun .
stay here .
really , 007 !
q !
what the hell are you doing here? !
i might have killed you !
well , i'm on leave .
thought i'd pop round and see how you were getting on .
are you all right?
of course .
how'd you find me?
moneypenny .
she's worried about you .
this is no place for you , q. go home .
don't be an idiot , 007 .
i know exactly what you're up to , and you're gonna need my help .
remember , if it hadn't been for q branch , you'd have been dead long ago .
everything for a man on holiday .
explosive alarm clock , guaranteed never to wake up anybody who uses it .
dentonite toothpaste .
to be used sparingly .
it's the latest in plastic explosive .
i could do with some plastic .
i thought there might be a mess to clean up .
pam , this is q , my uncle .
uncle , this is miss kennedy , my cousin .
ah !
we must be related !
how do you do?
now , pay attention , 007 .
now , this looks like an ordinary camera , doesn't it?
what kind of film does it take?
1 20? . 220 high velocity .
now , this is a signature gun , and that is an optical palm reader .
and if i plug this into the bottom like that , ... .. once i've programmed it ...
now , nobody can use the gun but you .
smile , boys .
don't use the flash !
stop fiddling with things you don't understand .
you might have killed him .
that's odd .
look , let's all get some rest .
we've got a long , hard day ahead of us tomorrow .
good night , q.
sweet dreams , mr bond .
i hope you don't snore , q.
you all know truman lodge .
and this is my head of security colonel heller .
kombanwa .
this is an historic moment .
east meets west .
drug dealers of the world unite .
extra bonus .
your job's done .
take q and fly out of here now .
i'll make my own way back .
i'd like to stay .
no .
i work better alone .
piso tres .
in this business , there's a lot of cash .
and a lot of people with their hands out .
in a word : bribery .
exactly .
he took the words right out of my pocket .
so you pay .
everyone and his brother is on the payroll .
so you buy a mayor , a chief of police , a general ...
a president .
one day you wake up and you own the whole goddamn country .
then you take what you want .
a bank , a gambling casino , airline concession .
why?
simple .
it's easier for the politicians to take silver than lead .
we have an invisible empire from chile to alaska .
what i want to do , amigos , is to make you part of it .
i want the pacific to be our little puddle .
what you have before you is a demographic report , ... .. breaking down each of your territories by age and socioeconomic group .
now , as you can clearly see , there is a huge potential demand , ... .. given the implementation of aggressive marketing .
as in the united states , ... .. senor sanchez is prepared to offer each of you exclusive franchises .
the price is 100 million per territory .
i believe you'll find that works out to , uh , 20 million per metric ton , mr tan .
we guarantee quality and price for five years .
senor sanchez , since arriving , we've eaten well , heard many good stories , ... .. but before i pay anything , i want to see some hardware .
mr kwang , you don't pay for , uh ... hardware .
you pay for my personal guarantee and protection .
surely if you were to invest 100 million , you would want some reassurance .
you're right .
why not?
tomorrow i'll take you to our main distribution centre .
here you are .
goodbye , q. thanks for all you've done .
what? !
you're a hell of a field operative .
now go .
i'll see you back in london .
no more business .
time to have some fun .
gentlemen , enjoy yourselves .
this kwang ... seems like trouble .
why show them the labs?
don't worry .
he won't expose the operation , huh?
his excellency , el presidente lopez .
hector .
pasa .
there's been a mistake with my cheque .
look at it .
it's half the usual amount .
you were very quiet ... when i was arrested .
remember , you're only president ... for life .
watch the birdie , you bastard !
aagh !
take his arm .
who would have a signature gun?
james bond .
this is her majesty's government's .
how did you get it?
piss off !
who ordered you to kill sanchez?
no one .
he's a rogue agent .
my orders are to take him back one way or the other .
we're hong kong narcotics , you bastard !
sanchez is taking us to the heart of his operations .
i've been setting it up for years !
i just hope that little stunt of yours hasn't scared him off !
get me out of these bloody things .
no , commander .
you're a loose cannon on deck .
i'm shipping you straight back to london .
leave him !
no !
come on !
don't let them take you alive .
he's still alive .
who was it?
who sent you?
cyanide .
hey , amigo !
how do you feel?
i'll survive .
lupe .
please .
the wavekrest is arriving tonight .
krest is coming here .
no , i'll call you back .
pedro , bring us some coffee .
good .
baby .
please .
well ... we both had close calls last night .
you were just in time .
things were about to turn nasty .
who were they?
freelance hit team .
what did they want with you?
one of them must have recognised me in the casino .
they were afraid i'd warn you , spoil their plans .
so you knew them?
i used to work for the british government .
we kept dossiers on such people .
british agent .
caf , senor .
i knew it .
gracias .
you have class .
those men ... tried to kill me .
who would do such a thing?
someone close to you .
cream?
sugar?
no .
did they tell you this?
they were well briefed .
obviously by someone on the inside .
did they mention a name?
no .
they were expecting to be paid a lot of cash ... .. by someone arriving in isthmus tonight .
you suspect someone?
everyone in my organisation is 100 per cent loyal .
then you have nothing to worry about .
well , i have to go meet some people .
you rest here .
i have to go back to my hotel .
no , don't go to the hotel .
save your money , huh?
i insist .
stay here .
enjoy my hospitality .
lupe , show him the easy way up , please .
you are not gonna believe who this guy is .
former british agent .
how did you know that?
because i know things .
i want to meet krest's boat tonight .
we'll need a dozen reliable men .
is there a problem with krest?
we'll see .
and bring lupe .
she was there .
he's not gonna lie in front of her .
s , senor .
what are you doing?
i've had my fill of sanchez 'hospitality .
he said to stay .
you're asking for trouble .
there's no need for you to get involved .
just give me five minutes , then scream .
james , listen to me .
there's guards all over the place .
you'll never make it .
buenos das .
perdn .
gracias .
i'm going shopping !
i won't be long !
please don't !
not now !
senor sanchez said !
i haven't had one of these in five years .
don't worry .
007 always comes back .
james !
i thought i told you to leave , q.
we couldn't go without knowing what had happened to you .
get your bags packed , q.
what the hell is the matter with you?
just a couple of things .
kwang and his team of british agents are dead .
sanchez is alive .
i saw you in heller's office .
you're working with them .
no !
i want the truth .
i am telling the truth .
sanchez has arranged to buy four stinger missiles from the contras .
he'll shoot down an american airliner if the dea doesn't lay off .
what about you and heller?
felix gave me a letter at his wedding , ... .. granting heller immunity if he gets the stingers back .
did he go for the deal?
yes .
and then you missed sanchez , and heller panicked and he said the deal was off , ... .. and that i was dead if he ever saw me again .
there's more to this than your personal vendetta .
it's a mess .
sanchez has tripled his security .
you'll never get another shot at him .
we don't have to .
meet me at the harbour master's office in two hours .
q , bring the rolls to the front .
yes , sir !
ah !
senor bond !
senor montelongo , i'm making a withdrawal .
pilot coming aboard , sir !
well?
take me to the bridge !
gracias , captain .
i'll take over now .
you?
you're the harbour pilot?
no , i'm his secretary
all yours , sir ...
ma'am .
aren't you going in a bit too fast?
you wanna do the driving?
you take the wheel .
full speed astern !
what the hell are you doing? !
harbour pilot went crazy .
i'd stick to flying if i were you .
i got the job done .
franz !
what a surprise !
i didn't think you'd be here .
yeah .
i like surprises .
you seem to be having a lot of problems lately .
well , we had this crazy harbour pilot .
let's talk about the money you owe me .
let's talk inside .
does he have a safe?
not up here .
maybe below .
have a look around .
check the bow and give me a damage report !
do i have this right?
he water skied behind the plane , jumps on it ...
no , no .
he was , uh ...
well , yeah .
he threw the pilots out and flew away .
like a little bird .
the knife !
pedro .
would i make up a story like that?
you must have seen something .
where's 007?
he's coming .
that's not my money .
i swear !
that's right , amigo .
it's mine .
you think i'm stupid?
huh?
you rip me off , then use my own money to pay someone to kill me? !
you want it so bad?
then take it !
what are you doin '?
wait !
let me talk !
this is not my money !
no !
what the ...
aagh !
that hurts !
please !
what are you doing?
aagh !
sanchez !
please , franz !
no !
what about the money , patrn?
launder it .
this is where you leave .
take the plane .
i'll see you both in miami .
aren't you coming?
no .
they'll be after me .
it'll be safer on my own .
come on , my dear .
see you later .
what's that?
bond's clothes .
they're clean .
sorry to wake you , hermano .
i thought you'd like to know the information you gave me paid off .
i got the guy who set me up .
only one guy?
what do you mean?
i just thought that , um ... .. no one'd be stupid enough to try to take you on on their own .
i want you to come with me tomorrow .
where are we going?
it's a surprise .
you're gonna like it .
james , what are you doing back here?
your being here's not a good idea , lupe .
it's all right .
franz is having dinner with the chinese .
where's he taking me tomorrow?
he's showing them a special place .
i don't know where .
james , don't go .
i'm scared .
what's gonna happen to us?
don't worry .
when this is all over , i'll make sure you get back home .
home?
it took me 1 5 years to get away from there !
i don't wanna go back .
can't we leave together?
i'll be safe with you .
no , lupe .
i don't think that would work out .
how can we tell unless we try?
i think it's gonna work out very well .
all right .
i'll answer it .
miss kennedy , i saw you at the casino with james .
we need to speak in private .
it's all right .
he's with me .
james is in danger .
sanchez is no fool .
he is checking up on him .
you know , if they find anything suspicious ...
it's all right .
he's out of the country by now .
you don't understand .
last night he stayed with me .
at sanchez 'house?
s .
franz is taking him on a trip .
they leave in an hour .
if anything happens to him , i don't know what i'll do .
i love james so much .
you must go before you're missed .
now , don't worry .
we'll think of something .
i love james so much .
i'll be damned if i'll help him !
look , don't judge him too harshly , my dear .
field operatives often use ... .. every means at their disposal to achieve their objectives .
bullshit !
bond's just left in convoy .
two cars and a jeep , ...
.. turning north onto the main highway .
i copy that , q.
what are you doing to my plane? !
overhaul .
senor sanchez order it .
i must have a plane .
where can i rent one?
nada , senorita .
no planes .
you brought the stingers .
from now on i want them close to me .
we started this place strictly as a cover , but professor joe turns a tidy profit .
welcome .
this way , please .
i'm going to have to ask that each of you put on one of these .
it's for your own safety , so i'm sure you'll understand .
we can't have our best customers developing a ... drug habit .
this way , gentlemen .
our product dissolves completely in ordinary gasoline , ... .. making it absolutely undetectable .
how do you get it back?
you want us to tell you all our secrets?
before we're partners?
take them to the lab .
this way , gentlemen .
who's the new guy?
somebody i thought could be useful .
gracias .
can i help you?
i have a surprise for professor joe .
sorry .
no visitors this week .
i came all the way from wichita falls .
i'm sorry .
we took up a collection .
we wanted professor joe to accept it personally .
you may remove your masks now , gentlemen .
so , do we have a deal?
the terms were 100 million ... .. in negotiable bearer bonds from each of you .
professor joe !
it's really you !
oh !
it's magnificent !
rebuilt stone for stone and restored to all of its original glory .
is this for me?
yes , i almost forgot .
i got so flustered ...
tell me , child , have you ever thought of studying here?
would that be possible?
come .
let's see if you have the aptitude .
to a long association .
what's the process?
it's very simple .
honorato , mustrales .
an 18 per cent mixture of cocaine and ordinary gasoline .
just keep quiet .
we already have your first shipment being loaded into the four tanker trucks .
welcome , my dear .
please join me .
wow !
this is my humble sanctuary , away from the cares of the world .
your own private meditation chamber .
built from the sacred rocks of the original temple .
i did have it soundproofed , so nothing will disturb our ... meditation .
i brought you another surprise .
i love surprises .
where is it?
look , this really isn't necessary .
give me the keys .
bless your heart .
your monthly delivery will be by ocean going tanker .
we'll send our chief chemist along to supervise the reconversion process .
you keep the gas ... as a bonus .
and if there's a problem with customs , no evidence .
i know him !
he's an informer !
you disappoint me .
who are you working for?
huh?
tell me !
you don't wanna talk?
i can get the trucks out , but i don't think i can control the fire !
forget the fire !
get some cars !
we're gonna take the tankers with us !
wait a minute !
this setup cost us 32 million !
we have to try and save it !
i don't give a shit about the setup !
we've got 500 million in the case and 20 tons of colombian pure in the tankers !
go help heller !
we have a deal with the orientals .
we've got their money .
i said go help heller !
now , do you wanna make this hard or easy?
put him in the conveyor .
when you're up to your ankles , you'll beg to tell me everything .
when you're up to your knees , you'll kiss my ass to kill you .
i'm the least of your problems .
if you couldn't trust krest , who can you trust?
who's got your 500 million?
truman lodge?
what about the stingers?
what do you know about stingers?
we gotta go , patrn .
this place'll blow up any second .
where's heller?
i don't know .
that's the last you'll see of heller and your stingers .
thanks for the advice .
have my car meet me up at the top !
come with me .
you're dead .
you took the words out of my mouth .
sanchez !
are you all right?
switch the bloody machine off !
hey .
i was making sure these were secure .
it's a good idea .
take them up to my car .
of course .
oh , god !
it's heller !
yeah .
looks like he came to a dead end .
come on !
you .
come with me .
come on .
surprise !
bless your heart !
perez .
s , dgame .
bond has escaped .
meet me at paso del diablo .
s , patrn .
detengan a bond .
don't worry .
it's only money .
este gringo maneja como un demonio .
ok .
que pase .
oh , no !
shit !
brilliant !
well done , franz .
another 80 million dollar write off .
i guess it's time to start cutting overhead .
dame el stinger .
aagh !
carajo .
james !
prate .
you could have had everything .
don't you want to know why?
aagh !
well , what are you waiting for?
get in .
yes , sir .
i'll be up to see you next week .
good .
i'll be out by then .
m called .
he tried to reach you .
i think he may have a job for you .
look , felix , i have to go .
my , er , hostess has just arrived .
take care , james .
you too .
goodbye .
i thought you hated that thing .
iguanas are a girl's best friend .
well , here's to you , my dear .
cheers .
thank you for everything , james .
thank you .
you could stay here with me .
excuse me .
i think you and el presidente will make a perfect couple .
why don't you wait until you're asked?
so why don't you ask me?
