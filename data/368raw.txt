it's you again , nagara .
get yourself together !
damn !
you use your muscle to swing your sword , so you give in to the weight of the sword .
learn from azumi .
the strength comes not from muscle , but from speed !
wher e is azumi?
oh yeah , she's not here .
she was just her e a while ago .
yeah , she often disappears .
azumi !
azumi !
azumi
i wonder how far this sky goes .
it'll be any day now when we cross that mountain and enter the outside world .
that's right .
we are going to pursue our mission then .
excellent ...
yes , we are always going to stick together .
can't wait to leave this mountain and raise some hell !
i can't see any stars .
of course you can't .
it's still daytime .
stars only come out at night .
then where are they during the day?
time to eat !
i'm starving .
we're starving !
master , isn't this a bit overcooked?
fresh water fish tastes better when it's burnt like this .
nagara .
yes , master .
you'r e soaking wet .
what happened to you?
we were training in underwater combat .
master , he lost again today .
he fell into the river .
he lost and fell into the river .
skip your meal today .
no food , no mission , you have no chance .
what do you mean , fools !?
hey , stop .
let's get him .
hey , let's eat .
come , hurry up .
ouch , that hurts .
lately i'm beginning to see who's the strongest .
either nachi or azumi ar e number 1 and 2 ...
azumi is fast , and nachi is strong .
the rest of us ar e more or less the same .
i think i am one of the strongest would'nt you all agree?
hey , is that your only response?
nachi , that looks cool .
good luck charm , is it supposed to work?
something like this only works for someone who believes in it .
then it won't work for me .
yeah , well , you're a monkey .
i don't want to hear that from a frog face like you .
he's a frog , a frog !
we are going to leave this mountain .
leave?
this mountain?
do you really mean it , master?
at last , the time has come for us to carry out our mission .
yes .
fina ly , we'll all get to carry out our mission .
is this your son?
our lord tokugawa won the war , yet all this misery is left behind .
it's time we put an end to such wars .
we must try everything possible to build a peaceful nation .
i doubt very much that the toyotomi allies will retreat now .
most likely this conflict and chaos will continue for some time to come .
unless we eradicate ambitious warlords trying to take over the nation , we will never see any peace here .
gessai .
assassins are the answer .
train a group of master assassins and have them exterminate every single warlord who intends to cause conflict .
priest tenkai , i , gessai , swear on my life to accomplish your wish .
azumi , wake everyone up and bring them to the clearing .
i had acknowledged your potential when you were yet very young , and have trained and br ought up all ten of you .
your skills in the martial ar ts already exceed by far those of warriors in the outside world .
the time has finally come for you to go to the outside world , unknown to you since you were br ought here , and use your skills to perform your duty .
you all grew up and trained together , thus you all know one another truly well and have strong bonds .
now , make a team of two with the one you like best .
azumi .
are you done?
listen to me well .
the mission that will be given to you from this moment on will be most sever e and rigorous .
an assassin is unable to choose whom to kill .
depending on your mission , sometimes you must kill a child , or a great and respected person .
thus , i give you this final test .
slay each other .
slay your teammate .
kill !
the one who loses this fight and loses his life has no aptitude to pursue the mission that lies ahead of us .
the weak minded one who can't kill his friend will not be able to pursue his mission either .
the winners of this fight should terminate their counterpart and come back to the hut .
should you think of escaping without fighting , you must know that you cannot survive .
begin !
it's master's order .
we have no choice .
nagara !
come !
i want to pursue my mission .
i trust that you do , too .
nachi .
one of us will be left alive and pursue our mission .
nachi .
nachi , don't do it !
azumi .
this is our destiny .
get r eady !
azumi ...
you have become really strong .
nachi .
take this ...
this is crazy !
why?
why?
why?
i don't know why either .
but if we try as hard now as they would have tried in pursuing our mission , their deaths won't be in vain , right , master?
so this is a village .
master .
aren't we going to help?
master .
don't move , don't get involved !
how come?
we can easily get rid of them .
you have an impor tant mission .
this is no time to be mixed up in a trifling matter .
they will all be massacr ed .
don't dr aw your sword unless it is your mission to do so .
isn't it our mission to slay those kinds of bad guys?
master !
why , why not?
why , master?
why couldn't we kill them?
merely kil ing a hundr ed bandits will not change this nation .
as always , well done .
these kids have gr own up to be pr etty sharp .
what's going on?
i brought a letter fr om priest tenkai .
guys , good luck .
who was that?
he is a ninja called nagato .
throughout this grave mission , he will be in and out , but always moving along with us .
what does it say?
the following three warlords , nagamasa asano , kiyomasa kato
and masayuki sanasa will not regard the battle
of sekigahara as the ultimate defeat of the toyotomi .
they claim the young prince , hideyori ,
to be the true loyal successor to the head of the nation .
they press for the leadership of the nation to be
returned to toyotomi once he becomes an adult .
these three are dangerous rebels who will harm tokugawa .
they should be eliminated .
hey , girl .
what are you doing?
stop right there .
it's a young girl on her own .
it's okay .
yes , sir .
what a pretty girl she is , isn't she?
what are you doing?
can't you see what i'm doing?
i'm fishing .
fishing?
haven't you ever fished?
oh , i see , you have never gone fishing .
fishing is fun .
and , when i am fishing like this ,
i can for get about all of the terrible things that go on in this country .
moreover , if you catch a big fish like this , you can boast for the rest of your life .
fur thermore , a couple of fish from this pond will make you ful .
so you are hungry , and you want to eat a fish .
this is how you catch a fish .
what the hell's she doing?
kill him now !
that's enough .
let's go !
well , you ar e very amusing .
what is your name?
azumi .
what's yours?
girl , you'd better watch how you talk to our lord .
my name is nagamasa .
nagamasa asano is my name .
you are the one that wants to start another war .
why?
such a young girl .
what a pity .
i feel sorry for you ...
ar e you sure about that?
yes , sir .
asano clan is concealing the fact , but nagamasa was assassinated .
all of the guards were killed .
how did they do that?
who are these assassins?
they must be of the leyasu clan .
lord ...
if i may say so , we do not have any proof that they are of the eyasu clan .
proof?
ever since leyasu won the victory over the ishida forces in sekigahara ,
leyasu has been acting as though he has the whole nation under his thumb .
the r egime belongs to our prince hideyori toyotomi .
nagamasa , masayuki sanada and i had pr essed him to return the r egime to prince hideyori .
the r esult is nagamasa's assassination .
i am next on the list .
i am quite aware of that .
please remain cautious , my lord .
what?
this talk of proof and caution , kanbei , what happened to your warrior's way?
kanbei , it wi i be too late once my head is cut off .
i , kanbei , wi i not die after you , my lord .
i , kiyomasa kato , am not intimidated by any enemy .
leyasu is a stupid fool .
if all the warlords of the toyotomi side unite to fight against leyasu , he doesn't stand a chance .
i am troubled with a temperamental boss .
saru .
yes , sir .
we'll let them kill our lord .
azumi !
it's a signal .
they got kiyomasa !
okay , let's go .
they would be happy up in heaven for us .
but master , they wer en't tough at all .
those slowpokes were no match for us .
it's not that they weren't tough , it's that you are too strong .
that's why you can't easily show your strength outside of our mission .
that ninja who looked like a monkey , he was funny , wasn't he?
ninja?
has anyone received any cut from their weapons?
master , ther e's no way any ninja can get us .
ninja or any other , no one will be our match .
right .
but be careful , ninjas daub poison on their weapons .
poison?
even if it's just a pinch of poison , it may take your life .
oh , man , that's scary !
hey , azumi , are you alright?
what's the matter , azumi?
i was wondering if that nagamasa we killed the other day , and this guy today , are they truly bad guys?
what are you talking about?
what's gotten into you?
but we don't know a thing about the guy we killed .
he must have friends like we do .
no time for silly nonsense , azumi .
they have to be bad guys , otherwise , why would we have to kill them .
right , master?
no need to ask such a question .
enough of this nonsense .
have a mind of steel .
be quiet !
just eat !
we have completed our mission .
i'm going to take a piss , then .
well done in finding a double who ooked exactly like me .
can you kill those assassins next time?
definitely , my lord .
kanbei ...
it amuses me to see your failure , but the fun is over now .
saru ...
yes , sir .
we wi i start the attack this time .
it hurts !
i made a hole .
that's cool !
big brother , you're very strong .
you're not so bad yourse f .
know .
right everyone , right?
hey old man ...
listen big brother , i think i should open a hole in the left , that would look awesome .
you dumb ass !
if you keep doing stupid things like that , mom will get angry .
no , i am scared of our mom .
she is scary !
i'm sacred of our mom .
watch your step .
it's slippery with blood .
i'm bacj , you guys .
you're back .
i brought a client .
he's got a job for us .
brother , he looks like a monkey .
oh , oh , he got mad .
so , what's the job?
as a matter of principle , i don't read letters .
these ar e horrible assassins .
as soon as you find them , kill them without a word .
it r eads like that .
this is the drawing .
sorry , they're a bit slow .
this girl is cute .
so , one girl , one old man , guys , one , two , three , four ... ... that's it?
don't underestimate them .
they are tough , very tough .
we , sajiki brothers , have nothing to complain about if we can kil and make some money .
she is very beautiful .
oh , look over there .
master , can we go take a look?
yes , go and have some fun .
that was great .
yes , thank you , thank you .
my name is hyuga .
i am yae .
great .
you guys are better than us .
please , join our troupe .
have you trained yourself since you were little?
yeah , you can call it training .
hyuga , are you guys performers?
no , but we've been living up in the mountain , so we ar e flexible .
i see .
we've also been doing this ever since we cou d remember , but we're not as good as you .
since you could r emember?
yes .
that's just like us .
this is beautiful .
it's from a foreign country .
a foreign country?
yes , beyond the ocean .
come on , pack up quickly .
the sun will go down soon .
yes , boss .
are you leaving?
we ar e leaving tomorr ow at noon .
we ar e traveling performers .
if we perform the same act in the same place , we won't have an audience .
no , i'll come tomorrow , and every day after that , to see you .
thank you .
but i have been living like this since i was little .
stay well .
i'll see you again someplace .
come on .
hyuga , let's go .
how are the sajiki brothers?
the sajiki brothers are chasing the assassins .
they've confirmed the whereabouts of the enemy .
i have little confidence in those dim witted brothers to kill the assassins .
i know .
those sajiki brothers are just meant to be the first attack .
saru , go to the prison in nishikawa .
you mean to get that guy out?
eye for an eye .
poison for poison .
amagi , hyuga , time to wake up .
get up .
oh no , i slept in .
master , can i go out for a while?
where to?
i want to see the street performers one more time .
oh , that sweet one .
i think i can learn from her movement for my technique .
don't fall for a girl in a traveling company .
shut up !
well , master , may i go?
we're leaving at noon .
come back by then .
i'll go with you , too .
me , too .
amagi , aren't you coming?
they are in a playful mood .
are you sure it's okay , master?
hey , amagi , wake up !
how long do you need to sleep?
i thought we wer e to meet tomorrow evening .
things don't look good .
what?
they killed kiyomasa's double and not kiyomasa himself .
the enemy is onto us .
they've sent a party of pursuers .
master , what's wrong?
we've been deceived .
what?
kiyomasa is still alive .
we killed his double .
go get everyone .
we are leaving at once .
amagi , i've been telling you to get up .
amagi , what's wrong?
why didn't you say anything?
they are gone .
oh well .
hyuga !
yae was so sweet .
you're fond of yae , aren't you?
i wanted to spend a little more time with her .
i finally met someone i liked .
they may not be too far yet .
let's go .
come !
oh that's it !
let's look for them .
come on , let's go .
i'm sorry , master .
i can still do it .
our mission ...
enough .
don't talk .
i messed up .
i swore i would work ... as much as all of our dead comrades .
they were a lot of fun .
yae , i know who you like .
who?
azumi?
no , i am talking about the guy .
what are you talking about?
you can't hide it .
i know these things very well .
even if you fall in love , he's a traveler and so are we .
you'll never see him again .
such romances don't stand a chance .
are these them?
the ages are right on the mark .
and there is an old man too .
one , two , three , one two three , one ...
ar en't there too many?
there are more girls , and not enough boys .
a rough count will do .
by the way , do you see them?
these girls are incredible .
no two ways about it , they are the assassins .
they don't look like the drawing .
a rough r esemblance will do .
excuse me , sirs .
what can we do for you?
wher e are you going .
wher e are you headed?
you'r e cute .
come , i won't do anything .
you sure are pretty .
what's your name?
tell me your name .
let me touch you a little .
get this out of the way .
damn , brother .
what a waste .
nisai , don't you go too far .
don't waste your life .
don't come near me .
give it back .
you scared me .
stay back .
they look like the assassins too .
that's them , brother .
she is cute .
are you pursuing us?
yes .
you're getting the idea .
they have nothing to do with us !
we kill whoever we like ...
oh , i see .
then you have no complaints if you get ki led .
you are gor geous .
you fool !
hyuga !
you are truly cute .
that hurts !
it's not over , yet !
