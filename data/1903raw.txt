i am here to speak about trains .
the first real train in this country was built by peter cooper in 1829 .
does anyone know what it was called?
it was called the tom thumb .
since that time , trains have helped make this country what it is today .
a long time ago , most people never left their towns because travel was hard .
uh , yes?
how tall are you?
jacob !
i'm , uh ...
i'm four feet and five inches tall .
i'm taller than you .
jacob , come with me .
i'm so sorry .
be back in a minute .
such a jerk .
what about blimps?
i think blimps came later .
when?
i'm not sure exactly .
blimps are cool .
well , so are trains .
yeah , well , they're both cool .
trains and blimps .
anybody hungry for dessert?
i'm stuffed .
yeah .
me , too .
there's plenty of food .
we can have it for lunch tomorrow .
hey , when were blimps invented?
i have no idea .
yeah , me neither .
you can go down to the library and ask that little hottie .
she is cute .
it's the librarian fantasy , man .
glasses off , hair down .
books flying .
she doesn't wear glasses .
well , buy her some .
it's worth it .
