mrs. shrike , forgive me but ... if you noticed anyone hanging around my apartment?
has there been a burglary?
no , no , no , i just wondered if ...
you know errr ... if you noticed anything unusual lately?
unusual?
ah , never mind , mrs. shrike .
i am sorry ... to disturb you so late .
good night .
miller was operating the mill in long sleeves .
miller's arm was in the cutting zone of mill while it was off .
three : the mill suddenly activates , catching miller's sleeve , resulting in this .
what is the fucking point?
these accidents are never pretty , mr. reznik .
our job is to investigate these events from every possible angles ...
so that we might prevent their reoccurrence .
so we'd appreciate it if you are a bit more co operative .
i knocked into the fucking activator by mistake .
what caused the mistake , mr. reznik?
i was distracted .
by what?
what distracted you?
it was ivan , i was watching ivan on the pit .
the whole thing is my fault , okay .
who did you say?
the new arcwelder , i don't know his last name .
what new arcwelder?
ivan , the guy from the swing shift .
reynolds was picked up on a warrant this guy got his place .
what the fuck are you talking about , reznik?
reynolds is right over there on the pit as usual , busting his ass .
there is no ivan in national machine , reznik .
what is this?
mr. reznik have you recently suffered any head injuries?
ever hear of pumpkin pie?
no
trevor yeah
can i ask you a question?
sure
why do you go all of your way to come here every night?
is it all the way?
an airport?
for coffee and pie?
suppose i went to danni's ...
suddenly i get an overwhelming urge to skip town .
could i do that just in any diner?
is someone chasing you?
not yet .
but they will when they find out who i am .
oh really !
who are you?
can you keep a secret?
to the grave .
i am elvis presley .
i ran away from home to pursue my blue collar aspirations .
i thought you looked familiar .
got plans for mother's day?
i am taking my little boy to the amusement park .
suppose to be my day and he gets all the fun .
that is ok , when he is older
i will let him make it up to me .
a little guilt goes a long way .
how about you?
cemetery
oh , i am sorry thanks
i lost mine too .
still hurts .
i am not so good at losing family .
who is?
what's weird is that it did not hit until i picked out her burial dress .
i pictured her while buying it ... ... not knowing it would ...
you know , be the one .
seems unfair , isn't it?
not knowing things like that
hey , how about spending the day with me and nicolas after the cemetery?
sounds dreamy
hey reynolds , what did the feds want you for?
armed robbery .
oh yeah , that is right , because i and jackson had you packed and pantified ... ain't that right , jackson?
hey , i don't see what is so fucking funny .
you clowns think this's fucking like some big joke but it ain't !
personally , i don't feel too comfortable working with you .
you made me nervous .
you look like shit , acting all crazy .
what is up with you?
nothing is up with me .
it was an accident and i am the one who gotta live with it , not you .
you ain't hearing me , man .
nobody wants you here .
nobody .
see you tomorrow .
hey
howdy , partner .
you gotta go back to the shop .
tucker needs to see you .
what about?
i don't know , but it seemed important .
what !
he's ganna have to wait , it is miller time .
we need to talk .
follow me .
come on !
another bourbon .
make it double .
you shooting coke or something?
you look like a dope fiend to me .
no offence .
i don't use drugs .
i mean i don't even drink .
how about abnormally?
i see reynolds is back to work .
gets to me bail
i will tell you one thing , if i dig , you are showing carbon to it .
would you? never trust a con , cowboy !
they ain't get to live to be honest .
where they hiding you these days?
around
hey , you wanna see something?
look at that .
lost them on a lake .
they took a big toe from the left foot and a finger from my right .
that is why i walk with a gimp .
yeah , i can't shuffle my cock like i used to but the ladies sure like it .
oh , no .
you look like you have seen a ghost .
funny you should say that .
the guys from work don't think you exist .
that is why i can't get a raise .
according to tucker , you are not even on the payroll .
you believe that?
why would they lie?
they just have a little bit of fun with you .
i am not laughing .
quit fucking around , a guy lost his arm .
he could have died .
that ain't my problem .
you caused the accident , not me .
where are you going?
take a leak , you wanna watch?
i will be right back , don't just bail me now .
hello?
hey reynolds , it's trevor .
what time is it?
how are they biting reynolds?
you , you are drunk , reznik .
the game's over .
i got proof on you .
i could use it .
you better watch your fucking ass buddy , before you lose it .
trevor?
i need to see you , stevie .
well , jesus , trevor , i am not exactly alone here .
please , stevie .
i think i am falling apart .
can you come back in an hour?
no , no , no , no , i need to see you now .
in case of something happens , i need someone to know .
ok , give me a minute .
i appreciate you making time for me , you are the only one i can talk to .
my pleasure .
most guys don't come here for my conversation .
something is happening to me , stevie .
some kind of ... plot .
there was an accident at the shop .
a man was nearly killed thanks to me .
oh , my god !
now the guys at work are against me .
they want me out and i don't blame them .
just the way they're going about it ...
their eyes , their little games .
what?
e r ..
e r ..
t u c k e r trevor?
tucker?
maybe err you take this accident thing a bit too hard .
i mean ...
if they wanted you out , they could just fire you .
i am not worried about being fired .
then what are you worried about?
i don't know yet .

my ex , probably phone to ruin a happy mother's day
could you ...?
yes , no sweat .
i will take nicolas for a ride .
thanks .
how long have you known my mother?
about a year .
how did you meet her?
we just kind of met .

i hope so .
would you like that?
i guess so
hey , you wanna know a secret?
what?
my father left us when i was your age .
you wanna know something else?
made me realised what a wonderful mother i had .
you will realise that too some day .
what is that?
monster ride .
route six hundred and sixty six .
what does that mean?
well , a route is a road you take when you're on a long journey .
can we go in?
well , nicolas , maybe we should wait for your mother .
what for?
you are going straight to hell on route 666 .
ride here if you dare !
you are going straight to hell on route 666 .
look like someone had a bad crack up .
fill her up , cowboy .
we wouldn't be eating in there anytime soon , nicolas?

right , a right !
nicolas , nicolas !
hey , nicolas !
i need some help here .
okay , somebody gets a doctor .
hang on nicolas , i'm going for help .
nicolas !
i swear to god , i don't know what happened .
he is epileptic .
i should have told you .
i will call an ambulance .
no , thanks .
it is ok , baby .
it hasn't happened for a while .
i didn't think to mention it .
i could have killed myself for taking him on that ride .
it's ok , it's not your fault .
he won't even remember it , as if nothing ever happened .
wanna come in?
i think you could use a drink .
i hope wine is okay with you .
that'll work .
what good is it at home if you can't relax in it .
i will have to remember that .
trevor?
can i ask you something?
should my lawyer be present?
why are you always leaving such generous tips?
do i?
20 dollars for coffee and pie?
and entertainment .
entertainment?
you .
trevor , you don't have to buy my companionship .
sorry , i wasn't meant that way .
if you really wanna spoil me , take me to a movie sometime .
hmmm?
that is a deal .
my goodness , there must be a hole in this glass .
i will get it .
you wait on me .
thanks
it is the last door on the left .
reznik

my god , miller .
i don't know where to begin .
nah , don't sweat it , kid .
there is nothing to say .
i wish there is someway i can repay you .
well , for a start , you can give me your left arm .
in fact , that is why i came by here today .
isn't it , tucker?
fair is fair
we are just razzing you , kid
you keep your left arm , i will keep my settlement .
hell !
how can a guy lost an arm end up like getting a deal like this?
so , i guess you can call me lucky .
well , miller , if there is anything i can do ...
nah , forget it .
no hard feelings , huh .
i will see you around , pal .
ah !
hey !
help !
hey !
hey !
someone help me !

reznik
ah ...
i got ya , i got ya .
be cool , be cool , alright?
who did it , huh?
why did you turn the fucking braker !
was it all of you?
was it you , jones?
was it you?
was it you?
or was it you?
you sick bastard , you're imagining things again !
oh yeah?
you've been fishing with ivan lately , reynolds?
how's that ...
how's that tuna biting?
let's see how you talk yourself out of this one !
where is it?
right , what the fuck now , reznik !
get him off me !
pick up your shit and get the fuck out of here .
you are fired .
this motherfucker's crazy .
you lost it , man .
shit !
damn it !
where is it?
asshole !
what the fuck did you do with it?
idiot !
hey !
fuck you !
get out !
what?
it's an occupational hazard .
so , trevor , are you gonna rescue me from this miserable life or what?
i could give it up for the right guy .
oh , that came out wrong .
what i mean is ...
i would , you know , stop hooking if you wanted me to .
i mean , there are lots of pancakes out there , right?
i think i'd like that .
mr. reznik .
i am sorry , i thought it was somebody else .
you leave me in such a scare .
what are you doing in my apartment?
there is a leak in my ceiling .
it's coming from your apartment .
that's impossible .
i'm gonna leave a note .
a note?
what kind of note?
about the leak .
what's that terrible smell?
there is no leak in this apartment .
now if you would excuse me ...
you're sure you're alright , mr. reznik?
yeah , i'm sure .
if you need anything , please call first .
miller !
hey , reznik .
it's a pleasant surprise .
we need to talk .
take a look at this , huh?
picked it up at grossens , top of the line .
let's not trim anyting for a while .
i need to be doing something .
can't just watch the soap opera all day .
that hydro will be here tomorrow .
you won't .
listen to the doctor .
margie , this is reznik .
the man who cost me my arm .
how do you do , mrs. miller?
i've been better , mr. reznik .
is there some place we can talk?
check it out .
it's a beauty .
8 cylinders
speed sensitive steering
abs breaking with road texure and tension
defence lock up helps you maintain control in emergencies .
of course , it's automatic .
hell i wanted a stick ... but i figured my shifting ability wouldn't be so hot .
you know i am not at national any more , right?
yeah , i heard about it .
it sounds like you almost lost one yourself , huh?
did you find that a bit ironic , miller?
ironic?
i'm sorry kid , i never got over sixth grade .
i'll break it down for you , miller .
moments after you left the shop , someone powered up my machine .
with my arm in it .
i nearly got killed .
accidents happen .
it wasn't an accident .
accidents happen out of negligence
this happened down the spike .
that's some vocabulary you got kid .
spike .
it wields vengeance , vengeance means revenge miller .
i am sure you know what revenge means , don't you?
i am onto you miller .
despite your stupid jokes , you secretly balme me for the accident .
new car , huh?
you despise me for it .
how did you get into my place?
duplicate keys? credit card?
what?
fuck you , miller !
this shit is gonna stop !
get off my property , punk !
bastards .
shit .
come on .
7 4 ... ... 3 c r
it's 743cr .
what?
shit .
fuck !
i'm sorry sir , but we don't provide ... ... motor's information to the general public .
i'm not just a memeber of the general public .
this guy is a friend of mine .
but you don't know your firend's address?
we just met , i don't know him that well .
sir , this is the dmv , not the dating service .
i just want talk to him .
i'm sorry sir , i can't help you unless a crime has been committed .
has a crime been committed?
please , i wouldn't ask if it weren't extremly important .
sorry sir .
no crime , no information .
what if i told you i was hit by this car?
i don't see any bruises .
if you did , would you give me an address?
no , but the police might .
i want to report a hit and run .
bring it back when you are finished .
fill it out over there .
mr. reznik .
you sure about these plate numbers?
743cr .
all right , that's the one .
do you ever have a car stolen?
no , what?
cause the car that allegedly hit you was your own .
1969 , red pontiac viper registered to your name .
nearly a year ago you reported it as being totally wrecked .
do you know it is a felony to file a bogus police report?
hey , wait a minute .
you got some explaining to do .
hey !
hey !
jesus , reznik .
just wanna talk to you .
hey come back .
reznik , reznik !
trevor?
oh , no .
trevor , what do you want?
trevor , it's okay .
oh god , what happend?
i was crossing the street .
lights changed on me .
did he stop?
no , he just kept going .
he fucking hit my drivers man .
he gotta be hanged .
it was my fault .
i wasn't paying attention .
trevor , we got get you to a hospital .
you may have some internal injuries . it is just bruises .
okay , you see this?
this is a bruise , and this is a train wreck , alright?
what is it with you and doctors?
don't you trust anyone?
i trust you .
now i know .
you are crazy .
can i stay here tonight?
babe , you can stay here every night .
you know that?
what?
what, babe , what's going on in that crazy head of yours?
i really want this to work , stevie
but?
you know so little about me .
what if i turned into a warewolf or something?
i will buy you a flea collar .
i love you .
stevie
yeah .
thanks .
i set out some clean cloth for you , your stuff is not dry yet .
you always keep men's cloth lying around?
some of my regulars .
they like to keep their clean change cloth here .
i probably just throw them out now , alright?
hey , perfect fit .
yeah , whatever trevor .
i don't have a size 26 waist here .
hey , how about that idea .
i can get a job selling man's wear .
those chicks got paid vacations too .
i'll settle for that .
that's not a bad life .
could be worse .
you know whatelse i want to do?
i want to clean up this place , just get rid of all the fucking junk .
probably look like i'm a terrible housekeeper , which i sometimes am ... ... but i can also be very very , you know , organised and neat .
and i wanna do more of that .
i would love to paint a place .
just make it nice , just be organised , and neat and paint it white .
what i would also like is a decent stove .
this one is covered in fat .
just like a white , beautiful place and a decent stove .
not a lot to ask .
wow , don't look so surprised .
a call girl scrambling eggs ...
yeah that's funny , i dont think i ever cooked for a guy before .
not even my husband .
jesus christ .
where is he?
who?
you know who .
trevor .
don't .
jesus , trevor , what's wrong?
this , ivan .
he's your ex , isn't he?
what?
why is he doing this?
just becuase i'm fucking you , isn't it?
now it all makes sense .
i'm fucking you , so he's fucking me .
where is he?
hiding in the closet , beneath the bed?
i don't know what you are talking about , babe .
ah , don't babe me .
yeah , babe .
i'll change my whole fucking life for you .
i'll do anything you want , babe .
you know what , i don't deserve this .
what did you do?
hey !
slip this from my wallet from me while proposing to me?
fuck you !
you left it in my tip jar the other night .
bullshit .
i thought you wanted me to have it .
cut the crap , stevie .
what is a big deal about a goddamn picture?
they said that the guy in the photo doesn't exsit .
this says he does .
trevor , i don't understand what the fuck you are talking about .
i'm talking about your ex !
ivan .
who?
this guy standing next to you with a fish?
i'm not in that photo .
trevor , i'm looking at a picture of you .
you are stading next to some fat guy with glasses holding a fish .
that's not me .
trevor , it's you .
look .
you lying whore .
you get the fuck out .

you are a fucking pig

what's going on here?
i've never seen you before .

you come here every night , stay on that same stool , staring at your coffee .
honest , i am starting to think that you are mute .
i wanna see marie !
mister , there is no marie that works here .
is everybody at it?
let's have a laugh on trevor .
whatever ivan was paying you is wasting his money .
go home , mister .

who are you?
oh hell , look like you got some explaining to do , partner .
