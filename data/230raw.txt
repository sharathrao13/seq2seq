and you take line number four and yes , yes .
direction porte de clignancourt , and you're right there .
okay?
yes .
excuse me .
thank you for coming .
in the name of the president , i want to personally apologize for this mess .
i want to stress that we would not want anything like this ... to jeopardize the warm relation and successful economic ties ... shared by our two countries .
so ... we have assigned our best man to supervise this case .
he handled the tehran incident for us masterfully .
and teneriffe too .
there is no one more qualified to bring this ... to a mutually beneficial conclusion .
inspector richard .
bonjour .
sir minister .
this is minister tang , our liaison from the people's republic of china .
it's an honor to meet you , sir .
the honor is ours .
the minister tells us you are the best of the best .
well , the minister is too kind .
if that were true ,
i might have been able to avoid this tragedy .
i'm hoping that you might help us understand what went wrong ... so that we can avoid further bloodshed .
and hopefully , bring this matter to a quick and satisfactory conclusion .
if we could be showed the facts .
yes , of course .
please .
uh , as you know , as soon as you informed us ... of the criminal activities of the gangster sung , we set our operation in motion .
we identified his heroin smuggling routes into france .
and in the spirit of cooperation , we graciously accepted your offer ... to have one of your people , liu jian , come over ... to assist us in sung's arrest as he was meeting with his french contact , who unfortunately we haven't yet identified .
here ... he is surveilling sung as we were waiting for the contact to arrive .
and here , he's observing along with us .
and then , for some reason we still can't understand , he went completely insane .
left the room to pee , and next thing we know ... he's knocked out the bodyguards , killed sung and the prostitute .
this is the gun he used to murder sung .
chinese police issue .
do you recognize it?
yes .
good .
oh , we have also verified his fingerprints on the weapon .
well , please , feel free to verify our findings with your own people .
we assume that your man was part of the conspiracy that he murdered sung to keep him from being captured ... and testifying in your courts , as you had requested .
but that is only an assumption .
we are hoping you could give us some background on him ... which would help us in his capture .
inspector liu jian was top in all his classes at the academy .
he received the highest training in martial arts , weapons and police tactics .
he's been decorated for bravery in the line of duty six times , been promoted five times , and has never lost a case .
he has no wife , no children .
his only dedication is to his work .
he's our best , which is why this is all so confusing .
well , you know , sometimes the best are also the worst .
it's really sad .
any surveillance cassettes?
destroyed as he made his escape .
do you know if he has any relatives in paris?
any friends or
he has no one .
well , then we should be able to wrap this up very soon .
excuse me .
excuse me .
i found the emergency phone .
oh , that's good news .
stay by the phone .
i'll call you back later .
inspector richard , we are very sorry ... that the operation was sabotaged .
i will report back to my superiors and get you any help i can .
thank you .
let me show you out .
i want them followed .
i want their phones tapped .
i want to know every move they make , every word they speak .
there must be a sleeper he's staying with in paris .
find him .
so , i guess you will be staying ...
longer than you expected .
a little longer .
paris is a nice city once you get used to it .
and the french are nice people once you get used to them .
are you hungry?
no .
family recipe .
very tasty .
fifty men on the street , and you can't find this son of a bitch?
did you try his hotel?
the fuck never checked in .
the fuck never checked in .
that means he has a friend in paris , or family .
even better .
who tried chinatown?
here .
but it's hard to be discreet .
so put on a wig and a kimono .
i don't care how you do it .
now , get out .

so i'll have to let you go , you and your precious .
do you realize how much i must trust you to let you go just like that?
with everything you know?
everything you've seen?
one phone call from you , one word , and i'd be locked up for the rest of my life !
i'd never do that !
i'd never give you up , ever !

they recorded everything .
they said that , uh , you destroyed all the cassettes .
except one .

the main thing now is to get you out of the country .
i have a car .
we can go to the airport , and from there we can
shit !
he's under the bridge !
get out !
block the north side !
i'll cover the south !
go !
go !
will this be a problem?
with a billion of them , do you think they'll miss one or two?
the embassy's asking for the release of his personal effects .
send them a big wreath of flowers ... with my condolences .
how much should i spend?
this much .
here are your assistant's personal effects , and here ... are some photos of your hero killing another chinese citizen ... on the french soil .
there's a time for diplomacy and a time for action .
diplomacy is dead .
you should go to the hospital .
do you have a needle and thread?
you know , since i began my work ...
i have received five of you young men .
fast , proud like you .
four have died the last one right in my arms .
before my time is up here , i would like to send one home alive .
i'll go for some bandages and disinfectant for you .
hi .
need any help?
no .
i have some experience .
you know , the longer that that thing stays open , the more risk there is of infection setting in , and then you are in for it .
i once had a scrape i ignored .
i let it go for a couple days .
it turned into staph infection .
all right !
but only to sew it .
then you must leave .
okay?
yeah .
doesn't like me standing outside , huh?
your uncle .
well , i don't blame him .
if i were him ,
i wouldn't like me standing out there either .
now , this is gonna sting .
believe me , if i had any other place to stand , i would .
it's just all the good spots get taken by the others and
you would not believe how much business some of these girls do .
guess how much some of them do in a day .
i don't know .
well , guess .
i can't .
sure you can .
pick a number .
five .
five?
how about 25?
twenty five?
mm hmm .
well , i mean , that's the record .
but at least 15 .
can you believe that?
no .
yeah .
me?
i'm lucky if i can do five in a week .
you ever been with a hooker?
no .
not even once?
no .
are you gay?
no .
that'd be okay if you are .
i think everyone should be who they want to be ...
and do it with who they want to do it with .
i'm not gay !
all i'm saying is , i don't hold nothin 'against nobody that way .
are you finished?
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
there .
mmm .
here you go .
good as new .
oh , my god .
look at that scar .
let me see .
i'm fine .
thank you .
thank you very much .
you did a very good job .
i used to sew up pigs .
that was my specialty .
used to have this big , fat mama sow , and she tore herself along the barbwire when ... she was trying to get to the other side of the fence to get at these apples from the neighbors .
so , are you gonna be around long?
no .
i go home as soon as my business is over .
hmm .
and so , what is your business ,
if you don't mind me asking?
shrimp .
oh , yeah .
pretty aggressive shrimp .
you should probably be more careful .
no wife?
no .
haven't met the right girl , i bet .
right?
my work it's hard to meet any girls .
any interest in an ex junkie hooker ... who can cook , clean , sew and who likes chinese food?
no , thank you .
i'm just kidding .
hey , look .
see?
my daughter .
my angel .
sweet , huh?
yes .
why do you do this kind of ... job?
well
there was this guy , and , uh ,
i met him after i had my baby .
and where i come from , girls without husbands just do not have babies .
and if they do , well , it's kinda hard on 'em .
so , anyway , this guy i met he's this french guy .
he's really cool with this great accent ... and always talking about art and books and movies and everything .
and , boy , when you're , you know
when you're young and really desperate , you know , this
and this guy could really i mean , he could talk .
you know?
and so i don't know .
you know , and the next thing you know , you're on the street .
why don't you just ... quit?
it's a little more complicated than that .
what do you mean?
i should probably get back .
see you later .
nice talking to you .
lupo !
practicing embroidery on the clients?
no , no , he's not [ screams ]
lupo , he was just he had a cut on his arm .
i thought he was gonna call the medics , and they'd be blocking off the street , and then the clients couldn't come , and i couldn't be standing on my spot , and i couldn't make any money for you , so i thought if i just took five minutes , then
shh .
get back to work .
lupo , he had nothing to do with
i said , get back to work !
excuse me .
i'm really sorry to interfere in your business .
but i would really appreciate it ... if you ... don't do that again .
the little statue speaks .
you know , i don't care if you fuck her , bleed on her .
you're still using her time , and her time is my money .
you've kept her busy for 20 minutes .
do you know the going rate for 20 minutes?
no .
five hundred francs .
ah !
five for her time , now five for mine .
my kind of client .
lupo , lupo , we should get back

oh , god !
oh , my god !
oh , god .
oh , god .
what're we gonna do?
what are we gonna do?
respect his wishes .
listen .
the longer you keep information from me about this psychopath you sent over , the longer my city will bleed innocent blood .
i assure you , inspector , we have kept no information from you .
good .
what're we gonna do now?
i don't know .
i can't walk the streets all night .
walking helps me think .
walking hurts my feet .
then go home .
oh , just like that .
first you put me in this mess , and then you think you can just get rid of me .
i put you in this mess?
you were the one who came to the shop to pee .
you were the one who offered to sew me up .
i didn't ask you for anything !
i only asked to be left alone .
oh , yeah , that's you don't need anything , don't need anybody .
just have yourself and your stupid job selling shrimp chips .
i don't sell shrimp chips .
yeah , i figured that out .
i mean , i'm stupid , but i'm not that stupid .
i'm a cop .
i'm santa claus .
who is santa claus?
a big fat guy , red suit , flying reindeer?
jesus , god , don't you know anything?
take me here .
why do you want to go there?
the best thing to do .
when you lose your way , you go back to the beginning .
beginning?
beginning of what?
my work .
last night .
you you were there last night?
working with the french cop .
richard?
you know him?
yeah .
i was there too .
the redhead .
yeah .
no , it was a wig .
it was
come on .
wait a minute !
a second ago you couldn't wait to get rid of me .
you're my proof .
i will take you to the embassy , and you will tell them everything .
no , no .
i'm in deep enough .
i'm not gonna be your witness .
you're the only one who can save me .
don't you listen?
richard has my daughter .
but you don't think about that , do you?
no !
you don't think what's gonna happen to her , you don't think what's gonna happen to me .
of course not !
you only think of your job .
because that's all that matters to you , because that's all you've got in your crummy cop's life .
you take richard down , and it's just gonna leave a space for another bastard , one who we pray will be less of a bastard than the one before him .
and that's reality !
maybe it's not your reality , but it's my reality every day , 24 7 .
and there's nothing you or anybody else can do to change that .
wait .
if i get your daughter back , will you help me?
i'm i'm i'm really screwed this time .
my government will protect you .
they will give you safely away .
away where?
to china?
i mean , i like the chips , but no , thank you .
listen to me .
i know you've had some bad experiences trusting people .
but if i gave you my word , you will be safe .
yes , minister .
we're doing all we can , minister .
but we are not magicians who can pull killers out of hats like they're rabbits , especially one who is trained like this .
i'm just a cop trying to do his job .
yes .
i'll call you back .
richard !
my god , richard !
you're not gonna believe this .
try me .
i this crazy little chinese
lupo picked the perfect spot , except it smelled like shrimps .
and how can i get any clients when i smell like a shrimp?
so anyway , i was trying to work , and max and lupo come along .
they went into the shop , and the next thing i know , the little fucker goes nuts , you know , and and i mean
max tried to protect me , and the chinese guy , he killed both of them .
i believe you .
and then?
and then he takes me as a hostage .
and , he made me carry this stuff , and he dragged me all the way up to that church
you know , the big church on the top of the hill?
and then you know and he made me ... help him do these things these weird things with incense and pajamas .
and every time i tried to run  he stopped you?
yeah .
you know you know those movies ... with that chinese guy who's always kicking and screaming all the time and
he used kung fu on you?
yeah .
yeah .
he did .
look .
wow .
and then he made me go to this restaurant while he ate this goop ... with weird things in it , you know , like snails and frogs 'legs and
that is when you escaped out of the bathroom window?
when he fell asleep .
in the restaurant?
he yeah .
richard .
please , don't don't do that .
do you think he is still there in the restaurant?
well , he drank a whole lot of beers .
that's why i came here .
'cause i thought if i helped you  what?
i could show you where he is .
you're not too tired?
oh , yeah , for sure .
i could probably sleep for a week .
but , i don't know .
i
you want me to come?
i don't know .
what do you think?
i think ...
i should come .
i think you should stay .
okay .
he's he's at the mandarin in belville .
but but i'll do whatever you want , though .
i mean , i just
i want you to trust me .
i trust you .
ow !
wait .
wait .
and if i discover i can't , i know where to find you .
what about my daughter?

# trying to procrastinate everything i do #

ah , johnny , johnny , i'm disappointed in you .
coming to paris for the first time , and instead of enjoying yourself , you're doing all this useless running around .
i don't like to get bored .

i put a needle in your neck .
that's it?
in a certain point , very forbidden .
it's called " the kiss of the dragon .
kiss my ass !
the blood from your whole body goes to your head .
it stops there , never comes down .
but soon it will come out from your nose , your ears , even from your eyes .
and then ... you will die , painfully .
you're really a smart guy , johnny boy .
my name is not johnny .
i slept long?
only a minute .
my daughter?
