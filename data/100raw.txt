12 seconds .
10 , 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 ...
navigator , 16 degrees off the bow plane .
they're really shooting at us !
why?
easy , boy .
if they were really shooting at us , we'd be dead by now .
i found out what happened to the caterpillar .
the buffer circuit has been torn out .
it was only a matter of time .
what are you saying?
somebody wanted to cripple the ship .
we have a saboteur on board .
it can't be any of the officers , it must be a member of the crew .
go and check puin's files for information on the crew .
we may have to put them off before we planned .
your average russkie don't take a dump without a plan .
wait a minute .
he will already have figured out how to get the crew off the ship .
we just have to figure out how he's going to do it .
they'd have to want to get off .
how do you get a crew to want to get off a submarine?
how do you get a crew to want to get off a nuclear ...?
i know how he'll get the crew off .
not now , jack
yankee one , declaring an emergency .
yankee one , vector 270 .
speed is buster , over .
say again , yankee one .
a bear foxtrot got too close to the group .
he bumped one of our f 14s .
the plane's damaged .
they're trying to get him back aboard .
busy morning .
russian attack boat subs have taken up station off every east coast port .
we're up here .
the new jersey and her group are moving up the coats .
the russians have attack boat subs and surface groups here .
that's a lot of firepower .
yes .
and there's something else strange .
they're not listening to their sonar .
at 30 knots , they could run over my daughter's stereo and not hear it .
they're not trying to find ramius , they're trying to drive him .
hounds to the hunters .
your subcaptain is going to make it to america .
he's going to die within sight of it .
his wingman requested permission to fire .
this could be the biggest naval battle since jutland .
jesus !
the water's too cold to eject .
try and bring him aboard .
what's this sub off by herself?
bart mancuso's boat .
he's at the bottom of red route one .
he's contracted what his computer calls magma displacement .
magma displacement is that like a seismic anomaly?
i suppose so .
can you get me on board the dallas?
mancuso found the red october .
he hasn't found anything .
this silent propulsion system could be mistaken for ...
the only way to get you out there is by chopper .
we'd have to strip it down into a flying gas can .
yankee one is on final .
rescue personnel are in place .
pick up your leftwing
power !
wave off !
eject !
this business will get out of control and we'll be lucky to live through it .
there's enough fuel to get you there , but the dallas may not be there .
she might have gone deep .
if you have to ditch ...
if you have to ditch , get into the survival gear .
at this water temperature , you'll have about four minutes .
next time , jack write a memo .
is the captain sacked out?
yeah .
what about him?
he won't leave .
you know , i've seen a mermaid once .
i've even seen a shark eat an octopus .
but i've never seen a phantom russian submarine .
we're emerging from the route .
we'll make the first turn shortly .
the caterpillar is operational and appears to be running normally .
the crew know about the saboteur and they are afraid .
that could be useful when the time comes .
we could make the labrador coats in 16 hours .
half of them would freeze before they were rescued .
it's massachusetts or maine in 48 hours .
two days .
do you think they will let me live in montana?
i would think they'll let you live wherever you want .
good , then i will live in montana .
i will marry a round american woman and raise rabbits .
and she will cook them for me .
and i will have a pickup truck
or possibly even a recreational vehicle .
and drive from state to state .
do they let you do that?
yes .
no papers?
no papers .
commence your turn .
in winter , i will live in arizona .
i think i will need two wives .
at least .
possible aspect change on target .
concur , change in bearing rate .
crazy ivan !
all stop .
quiet .
russian subs turn suddenly when they want to see if anyone is behind them .
we call it crazy ivan .
you shut everything down and make like a hole in the water .
what's the catch?
a boat this big doesn't stop on a dime .
if we're too close , we'll drift right into the back of them .
what about you?
what do you look forward to?
i have no such appetites .
let's see if he can hear us .
there's must be something .
what is it?
i miss the peace of fishing .
like when i was a boy .
40 years i've been at sea .
a war at sea .
a war with no battles .
no monuments .
only casualties .
i widowed her the day i married her .
my wife died while i was at sea .
post guards in the engineering spaces .
if he can get to the caterpillar , he can get to somewhere more vital .
where is he jonesy?
target is on our starboard side .
my read is that he's returning to base course .
concur , he's returning to 210 .
he went right around us .
give him another 30 seconds .
then secure from silent running .
here's what we got on the elf .
thanks .
what is it?
you're not going to believe this .
we're approaching no return .
dallas probably didn t get the message .
we have to turn back give it a couple more minutes .
you've got a reserve fuel tank .
i've got a ten minute reserve .
i can't invade that except in time of war .
if you don't get me on that sub , that's what you'll have .
if you've got ten minutes of fuel , we stay here ten minutes .
i've got a submarine at three o'clock about two miles .
okay , hook him up .
i'll be lowering you down to the sub .
let's hope this thing runs on fumes .
surface the ship .
this guy is in for a hell of a ride .
okay , commander , sit down .
did you ever do this before?
once , on a calm day .
the pilot will have trouble keeping it steady .
don't get grounded with that rod .
the rotors will be putting out enough static to light up chicago .
i've got a diver ready in case this guy goes in the drink .
who would go for a stunt like this !
if i've got to bring you back up , i'll shake the wire .
i'll give you a thumbs up .
remember to cross your arms .
okay , out you go .
he's halfway down .
you're drifting forward .
get the hook on his cable .
watch it !
don't touch him .
okay , here he comes .
it'd be easier without that crosswind .
i can't see him .
don't touch him !
this is never going to work reel him back in .
what's going on?
dallas , have you got a swimmer?
man overboard , port side .
send out the diver .
dallas , we are history .
get the doc down here .
i'll be in the escape trunk .
down ladder .
make a hole .
how do you do , captain?
it's a pleasure to be aboard .
i have to talk to the president .
of course .
may i enquire as to the subject?
my report of a missing submarine was not completely accurate .
the submarine in question is commanded by marko ramius .
apparently he has suffered a mental or nervous breakdown .
just before he sailed , he posted a letter to admiral padorin
in which he announced his intention ... ... to flare his missiles on the usa
why didn t you tell me this earlier?
moscow does not always tell me everything .
so one of your submarine captains has gone insane?
you offered your assistance .
you want us to help you kill him?
i have been instructed to ask your president for precisely that .
we'd already found him .
we had to break off to pick you up .
coffee .
a cigarette?
i don't smoke .
assuming we can find him , what am i supposed to do about it .
we're receiving flash traffic on the emergency circuit
bring it down .
well , mr. ryan?
chief , excuse us for a second .
come on , leonard .
the sub is named the red october , under the command of marko ramius .
there's the possibility that he and some of the crew want to defect .
defect?
excuse me .
the boat's the red october the skipper's ramius?
it seems that circumstances have changed somewhat .
get this man some dry clothes .
i'll be in the conn . soviet submarine red october under the command of marko ramius
reported as potential renegade .
threat of independent missile launch .
use any necessary force to prevent is approach to the united states .

bring us up behind him quietly .
make your depth 500 feet .
please listen to me .
two minutes .
time to intercept his track?
four minutes .
very well , mr. ryan .
two minutes .
i understand that message , it makes perfect sense .
ramius intends to defect .
the russians are trying to sink him .
they haven't been able to .
i have a firing solution .
the russians will stop at nothing .
they invented this story because they need our help to sink him .
weapons control , full safety .
i don't want this fish coming back at us .
i know this man .
has he made any crazy ivan s?
his next one will be to starboard .
he always goes to starboard in the bottom half of the hour .
flood tubes one and two .
you have to establish contact .
he wants to defect !
call chief watson to the conn with his sidearm .
possible aspect change in target
concur , change in bearing rate .
crazy ivan !
captain , he's turning .
which way is he turning?
to the starboard .
give the man a chance .
all back full .
say again .
all back full !
aye , sir .
we're cavitating !
he can hear us .
all stop .
we just unzipped our fly .
open the outer door .
firing point procedures .
if the bastard twitches , i'm going to blow him to mars .
all stop .
can you identify the contact?
los angeles class attack boat sub .
015 .
300 metres .
opening torpedo tube doors .

ready to shoot .
very well .
my orders are specific .
he is preparing to fire .
flood tubes three and four and plot a solution .
shall i open the torpedo tube doors?
shall i open the outer doors?
no .
look the firing solution into the computer .
do not open the doors .
aye , captain .
look solution into computer .
target has flooded his tubes .
has he opened his outer doors?
negative he's just sitting there
target is coming shallow .
what does that mean?
it means he's a very cool customer .
he knows we're ready to shoot .
he's heading for the surface .
what's his course now?
270 .
due west .
bring us alongside him .
sonar , report all contacts .
my only contact is typhoon 7 .
range to target?
range is 300 yards .
make your depth 65 feet .
he wants to go up and take a peek we'll play along .
weapons status?
weapons are armed .
tubes three and four are flooded , but outer doors are closed .
mark this bearing !
you wanted to talk to him , mr. ryan .
there he is .
what do you want to say?
will he be the only one looking through the periscope?
probably we'll have to chance that .
us told you intend missile launch .
do not approach us coats or you will be attacked .
if intention is other , will you discuss option?
can he acknowledge with a single ping?
he can .
the question is , will he?
verify our range to target .
one ping only .
aye , captain .
i'll be damned .
now what?
all right .
if defection ...
chart .
i need a chart .
where the hell are we?
someplace deep .
okay , send him this .
are you out of your mind?
just send it .
how did you know he was going to go to starboard?
i didn t .
i had a 50 50 chance and i needed a breakdown sorry .
that's all right .
my morse is so rusty .
i may be sending him dimensions on playmate of the month .
reverify our range to target .
one ping only .
captain , i just ...
give me a ping , vassily .
one ping only , please .
aye , captain .
what the hell is this about?
the russians want us to sink her .
we might have to do that .
we must give this american a wide berth .
let us turn south .
mr. kamarov , plot a new course due south .
180 .
shut down the reactor .
seal the ventilation system .
the ventilation controls have failed .
everybody out !
clear the compartment .
shut the ventilation system down .
the controls don't respond .
bypass it .

say again .
we suffered a leak in the cooling tube the ventilation circuits are disabled .

270 .
six miles and closing fast .
it's a warship !
here?
can you identify?
it's a us frigate .
probably perry class .
he's signaling .
red october , halt and stay where you are .
do not attempt to submerge or you will be fired upon .
he means to board us .
you will go with the crew .
the officers and i will submerge beneath you .
we'll scuttle the ship .
you will receive the order of lenin .

the captain is going to scuttle the ship .
he's going down , sir .
put a shot across his bow .
seahawk one , this is bravo command .

range to target 900 yards ... 800 yards ...
700 yards ... 600 yards ...
500 yards ... 400 yards ...
300 yards .
the torpedo is detonated .
that torpedo did not self destruct .
you heard it hit the hull .
and i was never here .
give dallas the go .

two million things can still go wrong with this stunt .
central intelligence agency ... there's a contradiction in terms .
how's the coffee , ryan?

jonesy ...
mr. ryan .
he's defecting .
and he can't change his mind?
he's not going to change his mind .
will you bet your life on that?
sir , could you hand me that hammer?
americans .
he's turning green .
there's our buckaroo .
what's so funny?
the captain thinks you're some sort of cowboy .
you speak russian .
a little .
it's wise to study the ways of one's adversary .
it is .
i doubt that you remember , but we met at the consulate in leningrad .
along with your wife .
i'm very sorry .
what gives you the right to fire on my ship?
you said nothing of a torpedo .
ryan .
we had to maintain the illusion .
are my crew being rescued?
as we speak
you sent the signal?
that's correct , sir .
how did you know that our reactor accident was false?
that was a guess , but it seemed logical .
very well .
i present to you the ballistic missile submarine red october .
my officers and i request asylum in the usa
it's a pleasure , sir .
bart mancuso , uss dallas .
torpedo .
the americans are shooting .
the pitch is too high .
it's russian .
another torpedo?
sonar contact .
alfa class soviet submarine .
why don't i have a detonation?
the weapon armed too late .
you had the wrong range .
fire again with the right setting .
get me power , and get that damn thing off my boat .
somebody just shot at us .
no shit !
get out of here .
the captain is fighting them
borodin , fire control .
ryan , sit here .
i'm not with the navy .
i'm cla
cla?
i write books for them .
sit down and do what i tell you .
russian alfa , 8, 000 yards to starboard .
i think it's the konovalov .
increase to flank .
that knob , turn right full .
all ahead flank .
right full rudder .
he's shooting again .
battle stations .
torpedo in the water .
bearing 315 .
make range 7, 000 yards .
steer right 315 .
that's heading into the torpedo .
estimate range 6, 000 yards .
steer right 315 .
that's wrong !
ryan , don't turn that wheel .
315 .
you're heading straight for it .
yes .
doing what?
he's turning into it .
he's directly in the torpedo's path .
mother of god !
torpedo steady at 315 .
5, 000 yards .
more speed .
we're already at 110
run at 115 % .
3, 000 yards and closing fast .
he's heading right at the torpedo .
can we shoot at the russian alfa?
i can't attack boat a soviet submarine without authorization .
torpedo steady at 315 .
900 yards .
20 seconds .
what books?
pardon me?
what books dld you write?
a biography on admiral halsey .
it's about naval combat tactics .
i know this book
your conclusions were all wrong .
halsey acted stupidly .
nine , eight , seven , six ... ... five , four , three , two ...
torpedo impact now .
i'll be dammed .
what happened?
combat tactics .
the captain closed the distance before the torpedo could arm itself .
that's it?
not quite .
capt. tupolev will be removing the safety features on all his weapons .
vassily , have you plotted a solution?
it's a little rough ...
gunfire .
he won't change his mind?
it's one of the crew .
whoever he is , i'd say he's having second thoughts .
i would like to have seen montana .
he's in the missile bay .
we're showing a hatch warning on number20 .
he can't launch a missile?
no , but he can blow one up .
captain , take the conn .
get in behind him and stay there .
captain , wait .
you may need this , sir .
thank you .
don't just stand there , go with him !
you , get your butt over here .
the torpedo broke up on impact .
set the safety ranges for zero .
we must get him before he gets to the ignition circuits .
what happens if he gets to the ignition circuits?
he can incinerate the ship .
is that the only way out of here?
yes .
don't let him get past you .
ryan ...
be careful what you shoot at .
most things in here don't react too well to bullets .
right .
be careful what i shoot at?
safety ranges set to zero .
where's red october
she's behind us .
right full rudder .
i'll shake him loose .
he's going deep .
30 degree down angle .
order countermeasures .
the alfa is too quick it's only a matter of time .
'some things in here don't react well to bullets ...
yeah , like me .
where is he?
close , sir .
900 metres , directly ahead .
got him .
mark bearings and fire .
we are too close .
don't argue with me .
do it now !
another torpedo , it went active as it was launched .
left full rudder .
ease her up .
i think he's got us .
way to go , dallas !
torpedo in acquisition .
range 500 yards .
you've done it .
i hope this works .
chief , put us on the roof .
countermeasures on my mark 5 , 4 ...
release countermeasures .
emergency blow .
full rise .
500 feet .
come on , big d. fly !
that torpedo is still active .
it's searching for another target .
a goddamn cook
it's locked on us !
how close is that alfa?
1, 000 yards dead astern .
we're turning straight at him .
the torpedo is still on our tall .
the hard part about playing chicken is knowing when to flinch .
collision in 400 yards , 350 , 300 ...
captain !
right full rudder .
30 degree angle .
this is going to be close .
you arrogant ass , you've killed us .
we have as curtained the red october's final position .
given the depth of the water and the spread of the wreckage .
nothing has yet been recovered .
your people are with the crew and are making arrangements for their return .
this has been a terrible tragedy .
if you'd come to us earlier , it might have been avoided .
i appreciate your candour in this .
and i yours , andrel .
in the future , technology may allow an investigation of the wreckage .
perhaps .
there's is another matter , one that i'm reluctant to ...
one of our submarines , an alfa , was last reported in the grand banks .
we've not heard from her for some time .
you've lost another submarine?
all this way to hide a submarine in a river .
it's 100 miles from any naval base .
it's the last place a satellite will look
i grew up around here .
my grandfather taught me to fish off that island over there .
why?
i figured you would tell me when you were ready .
there's are those who believe we should attack boat the usa first .
settle everything in one moment .
red october was built for that purpose .
now there il be hell to pay in moscow .
perhaps .
maybe some good will come from it .
a little revolution now and then is a healthy thing .
do you still like to fish?
there's a river not unlike this near vilnius .
where my grandfather taught me to fish .
and the sea will grant each man new hope .
as sleep brings dreams .
christopher columbus .
welcome to the new world , sir .
