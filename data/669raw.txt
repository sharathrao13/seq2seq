the witch of the waste?

mrs. hatter , sophie hasn t come down to work yet
i wonder what's the ma tter?
sophie !
dor t come in

i don t want you to ca tch it
you sound just awful ...

i'll stay in bed today
you sure?
all right , then
here we go ...
you'll be fine , old lady
you 're still healthy , and these clothes finally suit you
but i car t stay here
ouch , ouch
it's not easy being old
they 're saying this war is going to be terrible ...
like a hand , granny?
such a gentleman , but i'll manage
sure , old lady , but where are you of f to?
just a bit farther than where you 're going
i dor t recommend it , granny
nothing but witches and wizards ahead
thank you
going to the folding valley , at this hour?
says her youngest sister's there
i ve hardly made any progress a t all
thank goodness i've still got my teeth
that ii make a good cane
up we go
might be a bit too thick
ouch , ouch
wha t a stubborn branch
never underestima te grandma sophie
heave
a scarecrow , eh?
i thought you were working f or the witch
but how do you stand by yourself?
your head's a turnip
i've always hated turnips
at least you 're not upside down anymore
so long
it's so cold
the towr s still so close
dor t follow me you don t owe me a thing
you must be a magical whatever you are
i ve had enough of witches and spells !
just go stand wherever you like !
this is a perf ect cane thank you kindly
while you 're a t it , could you bring me a house to sleep in?
seems you get more cunning with age
what a huge battleship
i never realized how weak you f eel when you get old
i smell smoke maybe there s a cabin
turnip head , isr t that howl s castle?
this is hardly wha t i meant when i asked for shelter !
wha t is this?
you call this a castle?
is tha t the way in?
just wait up there
hey , there !
are you going to let me on , or not !
my shawl !
it seems warm enough inside , turnip i'm going in
thank you
even howl wouldn t want an ancient heart like mine
this time , it's really goodbye
you may be a turnip , but you 're a good turnip
may you find happiness
wha t is this place?
just looks like a dilapida ted heap
well , one nice thing about getting old is that nothing surprises you anymore
that s some spell you re under
it won t be easy to break
the fire talked
and you car t even tell anyone about it
you re howl?
wrong .
i'm the fire demon , calcif er !
well , then , calcif er , can you break the spell i m under?
easy
if you break the spell tha t chains me to this place ,
i'll break your spell in a flash
in other words , bargain with a demon
you sure you can keep that promise?
demons dor t make promises
i suggest you look elsewhere
but i'm an exploited demon
i'm chained here by a contract with howl , who works me to death
i m the one who keeps this castle moving
my , you've got it rough
if you figure out the secret contract , the spell will break
if you do tha t , i ii break your spell , too
all right a bargain , eh?
granny
granny
boy ...
i ve got my doubts about her
hey , who's this?
porthaven !
when did she get in?
stand by
why , mayor , sir
the sun is already high is master jenkins a t home?
the master is out
i answer in his stead
an invita tion from his majesty
it has come to war
his majesty desires every wizard and magician , even the witches , to aid our homeland
his presence is impera tive tha t is all
war , how awful
and who might you be?
calcif er let me in
don t look at me she wandered in from the wastes
the wastes?
that's strange you 're not a witch , are you?
a witch could never get in
porthaven , again
a customer?
stand by
state your purpose
mama sent me
the usual spell?
behave yourself , now
it s not the wastes
granny , are you a witch , too?
that's right , i'm the scariest witch in the land
sprinkle this powder on your ship and the winds will f avor it
sure
many thanks
i car t have you making up things
you should give up that disguise
it's not a disguise , it's magic
the kingsbury door
stand by
is this the residence of wizard pendragon?
it is , indeed
i bear an invitation from his majesty
please inform master pendragon that he is required at the palace
our thanks to you
a city fit for a king
get back in or you'll lose your nose
stop wandering around
that's enough !
i m going to get really mad
this is a magic house , isn t it?
oh , boy !
where does the black one lead?
only master howl knows
i m having my break f ast
but you ve got bacon and eggs
we car t use the fire when master howl s away
i'll cook f or you
but you car t
calcif er only obeys master howl
that s right , i wor t cook f or you
oh , here's my hat
all right , calcif er be a good fire , now
forget it , i'm a demon
i answer to no one
you'll do as i say , or i'll pour water on you
or would you rather i told howl about our bargain?
hey !
hey !
i never should 've let this old lady in
so , what'll it be?
that's right , there s a good fire
hey !
hey !
i'll burn the bacon
calcif er's doing wha t she says
i'd like some tea , too have you got a kettle?
sure
welcome home , master howl
you have letters from the king
to jenkins and to pendragon
calcif er , you re so obedient
she bullied me
not an easy thing to do
who exactly are you?
i'm grandma sophie

pass me two more bacon slices and six more eggs
yummy

and who hired you to clean?

master howl , are you going out?
markl , tell our cleaning lady not to get too carried away
what'd you do , sophie?
she abused me
if i die , howl goes with me
i'm the cleaning lady
it s my job to clean
no , not the 2nd floor !
if i were you , i'd put your precious things away in a hurry
save my room f or la ter
my little outburst gave me back my strength
wha t a strange house
amazing !
calcif er , calcif er !
are you moving the castle?
what a lot of fuss !
of course i am
you re incredible , calcif er
your magic s first class i misjudged you completely

how beautiful
it's called star lake
something s stuck in there
oh , dear lend me a hand , markl

and up !
a scarecrow
he s called turnip , the turnip head
you sure like being upside down
the odd creature seems to have taken a liking to me
he followed me here
are you sure you re not a witch , sophie?
that's right , i m the cleanest witch in the land
turnip , dor t pull it so tight
seems like he likes doing the wash
they ii dry in no time
turnip must belong to the demons
calcif er doesn t seem to mind him
you 're right , maybe he s a demon of the dead
but he led me to this wonderful place
i've put away all the laundry , sophie
why , thank you we d better be getting back
how mysterious
i've never felt such peace
stinks
you reek of burnt flesh and steel
keep flying and one day you wor t be able to change yourself back

sophie did this f or me
the fighting is fierce
the country s ablaze , from the southern coast to the northern border
i ha te the fire in gunpowder
they have no manners
my own kind a ttacked me
the witch of the waste?
hack wizards masquerading as monsters
they'll cry plenty later on , when they can t regain human f orm
no , they'll just forget they ever knew how to cry

i didn t mix up anything , i simply cleaned up
cleaning , always cleaning
i told you not to get too carried away

how humiliating
it's not so very bad
this new shade's quite lovely in its way
i'm done f or .
what s the point in living , if you arer t beautiful ...
stop , howl !
cut it out !
he's calling on the spirits of darkness
he did this last time a girl ditched him
please , howl , that's enough
you can just dye your hair again
i've had enough of you , howl !
i ve never once been beautiful !
i've had enough of this place !

dor t lea ve me , sophie

the witch of the waste is searching for my house
you re right , i saw her cronies down at the port
the truth is , i m a coward
all this junk is just sorcery to keep her away
i m scared to death
tell me , why is the witch of the waste a f ter you?
she seemed quite interesting , so i approached her
but she terrified me and i ran away
now the king s ordered me to report to him
as jenkins and as pendragon ...
how many names do you use , howl?
enough to guarantee my freedom
car t you refuse the king?
see tha t ...
the oa th i took a t the sorcery academy
say , howl why not visit the king?
wha t !
just say it to his face
stop this f oolish war i refuse to help you
sophie , you dor t know what they 're like
but he's the king , right?
a king thinks only of what s best f or his people
i know !
you'll go in my place , sophie !
pretend you re pendragon s mother

sure
see you later !
this charm assures your sa fe return
don t worry , i'll follow you in disguise
there of f you go !
i'm sure this will never work
i dor t suppose he's following me , disguised as a crow
i'm sure howl would pick a more drama tic disguise
not that ...
the palace is so f ar away
howl?
dor t tell me you 're howl
disguising yourself as an old dog , of all things
do you know how exhausting it is to be old?
how nice to see you the little ha tter , right?

thank you so much for delivering my note to howl
how's howl doing?
quite terrified
thanks to him , i've become a cleaning lady
my how delightful
by the way , wha t brings you to see the king?
job hunting i'm sick of working for howl
and yourself?
the king invited me
it seems that idiot , suliman , finally needs my power

that's impossible
my gif ts lie in casting spells , not breaking them
