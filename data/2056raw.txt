oh , magoo , you've done it again .
another day in the can .
good night , mrs wonderbottom .
ugliest hairdo i've ever seen .
hold the elevator !
aha !
express elevator .
elevator with a view !
now that's what i call an express .
good godfrey !
earthquake !
don't panic , everyone .
we've got enough canned food here to cover any emergency .
that's better .
carry on , boys .
parking lot .
mm hmm .
whoopsie .
by george , somebody fix the lights ... before anyone trips .
the escalator to the parking lot .
such sophistication !
good night , henry .
good night .
right turn only .
road hog !
blasted potholes !
the checkered flag?
magoo , you , you speed demon , you !
you've still got it .
el nino's back .
oh , magoo , you've done it again .
and tonight , quincy magoo , the canned vegetable king ... will dedicate the new museum wing he has donated to the city .
the magoo rotunda will house a travelling exhibit ... of the treasures of kuristan ... including the rarest of all rubies , the star of kuristan .
treat her gently , young fella .
check underneath .
i think there's something rattling there .
yes , you dropped the keys , my boy .
it's the most precious ruby in the world .
lovely .
it's just gorgeous .
it's exquisite .
exquisite .
no .
actually it's corundum .
that's an aluminum oxide .
okay , don't take my word for it .
exquisite is an adjective , not an element .
all right .
if you're so smart , how come mr cloquet told me ... to watch you like a hawk?
cloquet said that?
why is it that someone always seems to burn the rumaki?
maybe you should see another eye doctor .
waldo , hiram has been my optometrist since i was a small boy in knee pants .
he's like 2, 000 years old .
all his other patients are dead .
you can't hold that against him .
but he's still making appointments with them .
trust me , you need a second opinion .
oh , my gosh !
would you , would you look at that !
what?
wait , don't look .
don't look .
what?
she's coming this way .
mr magoo?
i am stacey sampanahoditra of the kuristani foreign office .
oh .
this is my nephew waldo .
waldo magoo .
it is an honour .
oh .
uh , you'll have to forgive him sometimes .
he gets like that , lost in thought .
quite a scholar , you know .
graduated with a large class .
isn't that right , waldo?
waldo?
waldo !
yeah .
l i , i w went there to college .
oh .
uh , waldo , why don't you invite , uh , stacey to our opera tomorrow night?
i would be most honoured , sir .
stacey ... will you join us for the opera tomorrow night?
it's a , uh , benefit performance .
uh , we're doing excerpts from the norsemen saga .
i look forward to it .
please excuse me .
i must greet diplomats .
that's a very attractive young lady .
but i'm , i'm such a fool .
l i tried to offer her a snack .
oh , waldo , don't be so hard on yourself .
cupid makes fools of us all .
and now , as curator of this museum ... it is my pleasure to present our benefactor ... a man of great vision , quincy magoo .
step right this way , sir .
ah , well , thank you , thank you .
ah , well , may , uh , may all of the exhibits in this hall ... chime with the light of human knowledge .
my dear , thank you .
thank you .
hey !
look out !
watch out !
oh , yes .
great scott !
what is this , indoor fireworks?
what a wonderful touch .
excuse me .
or a blackout .
i should inform the power company here .
get that fixed , and get these lights back on .
hello down here .
public telephone .
oh , what ...
excuse me , sir .
we have an emergency ...
great scott !
we have an injured man here .
bandaged from head to foot .
help .
some assistance , please .
and whoever did it has stolen the telepho ...
god !
they gave me a bad mask .
okay .
go .
i gotta watch her like a hawk .
morgan !
you just , uh , you just hang on .
i'll get you some medical attention .
you stay right here .
no , you're in no condition ...
oh , well .
how many times must i tell you?
stay back in the booth , man .
i'll take care of him .
i'll be back .
i'll get some help or maybe find a telephone .
freeze !
drop the gun .
turn around .
yes , sure .
must be a phone out there somewhere .
well , if you can't bring mohammed to the mountain ...
morning , angus .
avast , angus .
are you ready to cast off?
waldo?
what are you doing here?
oh , just cleaning your windshield .
aha , my boy , you are a prince , but i have a date with a flounder .
anchors aweigh .
anchors aweigh .
oh , the windshield did need cleaning , huh?
right , angus?
i don't think i've seen it this clear since 1956 .
well , now that you're here , we'd better inform the police .
orders , u. s. state department .
this incident is to remain completely under wraps .
which includes the crazy 9 1 1 call about a bandaged man in the museum .
we substitute a replica of the jewel and ...
and we open the exhibit as if nothing has happened .
hold it .
who the hell are you?
and who told the state department?
i did .
they said they would send two of their very best operatives .
gustave anders , cla .
i'm in charge of this investigation .
chuck stupak , fbl , and i'm in charge of this investigation .
the cla has no jurisdiction on american soil .
this could very well become an international incident .
not if you don't get in my way , fancy pants .
hmm?
oh .
i don't get it .
there's nothing in the papers .
it's a trap .
they're trying to lull us into a false sense of security ... and then bust us when we make a careless move .
we'll never make it to cloquet's .
they're onto us , luanne .
i can feel it in my ...
morgan , that's yesterday's paper .
oh .
nothing like the old sea air to clean out the pipes .
huh?
right , angus?
the sun is a little hot .
time to apply the old ban de soleil .
there we go .
oh .
a very refreshing , minty fragrance .
ah , the french .
they think of everything .
what's that?
the old fog rolling in , thick as pea soup?
not my pea soup , mind you , but maybe one of those other brands .
bob , why steal the star for your boss , cloquet , and get peanuts for it ... when he can turn around and auction it off for millions?
why not auction it off ourselves?
that way we get millions and each other .
me and you?
i could take you to places you've never been before .
i've never been to toronto .
i know a little cosy bed and breakfast place in toronto ... but we could skip the breakfast part .
come on , angus .
we won't let a little fog stop us , huh?
you rotten seagulls !
you con sarned buzzards , you !
uncivilized behaviour .
i'd never do anything like that to you .
i'm gonna have to get this dry cleaned now .
blast your ...
ho ho ho .
i've got a strike .
well , shiver my timbers !
it's a lunker !
just call me ishmael .
it's moby dick !
why , look at that ...
look at ...
look at that , angus .
it's huge .
he was a big one , angus .
just look at the size of those , uh , uh , pants .
well , i'd say we were in the bermuda triangle ... but we're nowhere near bermuda .
i'll just play it safe and head for shore .
well , angus , here we are in safe harbour once again .
well , an escalator to the top .
how swank .
must be a yacht club .
angus?
angus , where are you , boy?
well , hello , angus .
come on there , fella .
we believe magoo created a diversion while his accomplices stole the jewel .
but why?
mr magoo is a very wealthy man .
are you sure about that?
people do eat a lot more fresh food these days .
okay , we don't collar magoo .
we put him under surveillance .
but this is absurdity .
i'm to be his guest at the opera tonight .
great !
you can be our inside person .
that is , if it's all right with the fbl .
so , magoo has the star of kuristan .
but it was luanne's fault !
she double crossed us .
i shouldn't have hired her .
but she's the only one capable of stealing the star .
how could someone with such beauty ... be so treacherous?
i worship all that is beautiful , morgan .
the greatest sin is to destroy a thing of beauty .
i fear now we must destroy the beautiful miss le seur .
kill her .
but first , get the stone , all right?
tomorrow buyers are arriving from all over the world to bid on the ruby .
schmidt .
gosher .
havzinski .
i hear there's a rumour ortega peru might even show .
the piranha?
the king of the underworld?
oh , morgan , don't screw this up , hmm?
i'm coming .
on my way !
hello , sir .
um , oh , stacey !
aren't you a sight for sore eyes?
i thought that waldo was going to pick you up , uh , on the way to the opera .
well , in my country , the invitee always picks up the inviter .
i'm sure that waldo would not have it any other way .
unc , i need to borrow a tie .
oh , hi , stacey .
hello , waldo .
uh , why don't you , uh , show stacey the garden before you leave?
it's quiet and , uh , and peaceful ... and , uh , intimate .
i , l , i don't think she'd want to see the ...
i'd love to see more of your charming home .
all right .
it's , uh ...
it's right back here .
the smell of rice is in the air .
love in bloom , if ever i've seen it before .
angus?
come on , now .
how many times ... have i told you to stay out of that closet?
come on in here , boy .
help me with my scales .
it's my uncle's work .
oh .
never have i seen such a plant sculpture .
topiary's kind of a hobby of his .
and he specializes in the abstract .
oh , no .
that's a bunny rabbit .
hey , well .
what ...
what is ...
what is that?
oh .
so you want to play fetch again?
is that it?
ah , well , it's a dog's life .
here we go .
there it goes .
your uncle , do you think he needs glasses?
oh , and how !
just don't try and tell him that .
he will not spend the money?
i notice he drives a very old car .
is his business not healthy?
oh , no .
no .
he just loves that old car .
and if unc loves something , he won't let it go .
angus !
stop terrorizing the squirrels .
stupak !
where are you?
right behind you .
don't turn around .
just spotted a conspicuous white male .
dirty clothes , needs a haircut .
sticks out like a sore thumb .
where is he?
can't see him .

right behind you .
turn around .
don't turn around .
walk backwards .

yes , indeed .
the most precious jewel of all .

my jewel is luminous , sparkling .

anchors aweigh .
prunella .
uh ...

oh .
bingo !
oh , no .
it's luanne le seur .
the black widow .
she kills all of her male accomplices .
no one has ever been able to finger her .
wow .
whoever brings her in will get a big promotion .
maybe a book deal .
hey , where're you going?
nothing like the warm sea air .
huh?
lo ...

look at that .
isn't that wonderful?
dear me .

i hope i'm to your liking
well?
how do i look?

waldo , we mustn't .
well , w why not?
l ls there someone else?
it's mr magoo .

your government thinks mr magoo stole the star of kuristan .
well ...
a and you?
do you think he did it?
waldo , i need your help .
hey , we don't have a warrant ... so be quick about it , or we've both had it .
one , two , three .
testing .

mayday !
mayday !
magoo !
he's back .
i'm a lusty crusty viking
i hope i'm to your liking
and i'm a viking woman
a lusty , busty charmer
please let me pierce your armour and together we'll find love
all right .
oh , no .
don't .
put me down .
here we go .
my ankle's fine .
here we go .
ah .
well ... with a little more practise , i , uh , could pop the question .
quincy .
oh , your house is beautiful .
do you mind if i look around?
look away .
look away .
i'll just put my hat in the closet here , and ...
may i make you a cocktail?
ah , i'm famished .
do you think you could cook us something?
something hot?
can i cook?
you may call me " cordon bleu " magoo .
uh , which way to the little girls 'room?
ah , atop the stairs .
let me light your way .
ah , ah , your repast awaits you down here , my dove .
next i want you to put some water on to boil .
and while we're waiting for that , let's clean about , oh ... two or three sprigs of parsley .
water on to boil .
next , pat the chicken dry .
now , take some lemon and rub it on the chicken .
now , make sure you get the whole chicken .
lift the leg if you have to .
now , i hope you're not cheating and using bottled lemon juice .
if you are , it just won't taste as good .
why?
well , no peel appeal .
angus , there you are , old friend .
well , i can't play right now .
i don't have any time .
and now , lift both legs high into the air .
left and right .
all right , then .
just one last time , then you take it upstairs .
all right .
come on , don't be a slacker .
you can do it .
lift those legs !
left and right .
back and forth .
one , and two , and three , and four .
come on , you can do it .
lift both legs high into the air .
lift them left and right .
and left and right .
come on , you can do it .
lift those legs high into the air .
and dance !
come on .
get your rear into gear .
now , don't stop until you're ready to drop .
now you're cookin '!
go get some sandpaper , and sand that sucker smooth .
you don't want any bumps on the surface .
i recommend a medium grade paper because ... if you use a sandpaper that's too fine , you're gonna be at it all day .
now , whatever you do , do not use a metal file ... because that will shred the surface to a pulp .
must be a chinese recipe to make the chicken tender .
either that , or it's german .
use short , light strokes , and watch out for surface abrasions .
don't rush it .
these things take time .
unc?
i want him .
magoo is goin 'down !
you hear me?
what?
come on !
now ...
after you finish drilling , you want to make sure that you squirt some caulk into those holes .
unc .
there's something very important we need to talk about .
waldo , waldo .
how did you know?
i thought this was my little secret .
then it's true !
yes , and a lot of people are in for a big surprise .
have you gone insane?
yes !
yes , i ...
you have gone insane .
insane .
insane with passion .
prunella .
prunella?
prunella .
oh , oh , oh , you're talk ...
you're talking ...
that's wonderful , unc .
it's time that you met this glorious thief ... who has stolen my heart .
uh , i'll be right back .
prunella !
prunella !
oh , my gosh !
he did do it .
aha !
there you are , my viking princess .
come .
i want you to meet someone .
not now .
i can't wait any longer , quincy .
i'm gonna ask you once , and only once .
ah , you're going to propose !
oh , my precious bonbon .
you read my mind .
you know what i came here for .
you know what i want .
give it to me .
ah , you modern women .
you're so direct .
angus .
now what is this?
oh , we've been playing fetch all day with this .
all right , boy , go ahead .
hold it !
unc , who is this?
uh , waldo magoo , this is , uh , prunella pagliacci .
i'm fbl .
that man just stole the star of kuristan .

in this house?
he's heading for the driveway .
get up .
he stole the studebaker .
what?
the eggplant mobile .

watch your head .
this way .
hold it !

i see him .
i see him .
he's turning left .

he's turning right .
big truck !
big truck !
hold on !
he's a crafty fella .
taking evasive action .
that won't work !
you're not getting away .
that's the wrong car .
he's back there .
don't worry , my boy .
we'll catch him on the turnaround .
hold on , angus !
hey , look out !
stop !
look out !
stop !
don't panic , now .
we're only in some kind of tunnel .
brakes !
brakes , unc !
unc , hit the brake !
great scott !
those speed bumps .
i tell ya .
i'll sue this city .
uh , prunella , uh , about the fbl .
you were saying?
yeah , uh , uh , fbl .
i , i'm ...
i'm an undercover agent ... for the government .
does this mean no story in " the opera news "?
i'm sorry i had to deceive you .
they think you stole the star of kuristan .
that's what i've been trying to tell you .
what?
they , they what?
that burglar in your house was really a notorious jewel thief ... who works for a man named austin cloquet .
the bureau has learned that cloquet plans to sell the jewel ... tomorrow at a secret auction up at a ski lodge .
ortega peru , the piranha .
no one's ever seen him .
he never goes anywhere .
so if we could get someone to impersonate peru ... we could get close to the gem and recover it .
but who?
we lost him right here , and magoo didn't return home all night .
why is he always one step ahead of me?
kenyawa tambe just charged some tickets to a ski resort .
yeah , so what?
kenyawa tambe is one of luanne's aliases .
why didn't you tell me this before?
i just found out .
oh really?
yeah .
you know , we're supposed to be working as a team here .
you're going around behind my back .
if the pressure's too much for you ...
you'll take over !
you'll take over !
sirs !
i shall go with you .
no .
young lady , this is strictly a job for professionals .
then why are the two of you going?
welcome to the rockies , gentlemen .
if you'll follow me to the limo , i'll take you to austin cloquet .
who the hell are you?
ortega peru .
what's it to you?
mr peru never goes anywhere .
that's right .
i never go anywhere .
so when i go somewhere , everyone thinks i am nowhere ... when i'm really there .
now , let's put this show on the road .
uh , sorry .
mr peru , uh , this way .
there are no signs .
so you've been staking out my uncle all this time .
is that right?
that's my job .
and the way you say you feel about him , is , is that part of your job , too?
you all right , boy?
you saw this man?
yeah .
he just went up the mountain .
said his name was ortega peru .
magoo is peru?
magoo , the piranha .
this is big .
we're gonna need some backup .
don't you know how to open a door?
gentlemen , thank you all for coming .
we're especially honoured today to have with us mr ortega peru .
i was going to kill someone this morning ... but i did it last night so that i could be here .
well , you're too kind .
well , when you've changed your clothes , these lovely ladies ... are waiting to serve you with chilled champagne in the solarium .
thank you .
not bad .
what do they mean?
every time i kill a man ...
i tattoo his portrait on my body .
what do you do when you run out of room?
stop killing people?
hey , i bet peru's got some pretty nice tattoos .
you hombres , uh , go on ahead .
i have got to use the , uh , powder room .
come on !
let's go !
champagne?
oh , yes .

the auction will commence when you write down your opening bids .
uh , i do not pass my cash ... until i get a close look at the dingus .
give it to me in my hand .
mr peru?
your frog is leaking .
oh .
well .
gentlemen .
we have an impostor .
mr peru is mr magoo .
why would peru disguise himself as magoo?
shut up , you idiot , and get him !
keep your distance !
this hepcat has a black belt in mayhem .
hold it !
give me the star of kuristan .
the star is mine !
prunella !
the auction is off .
get out .
come on , go !
my dear !
by gum , you almost had me fooled .
unc , watch out .
she's got a gun .
of course she has , waldo !
she's a federal agent .
she's not what you think !
now , waldo , you're talking about the woman who saved my life .
yeah , well , nobody's perfect .
oh , you can't tell me that yesterday meant nothing to you .
i am a viking a lusty , trusty viking
yesterday sucked .

prunella .
