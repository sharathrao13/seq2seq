four spanish men with hiking boots had surrounded me close .
i could tell they were banditos because they had taco breath ... and they called me 'hombre . '
i spun around and hit the biggest one .
i punched him in the gut .
and as he was falling , he grabbed my backpack .
i said , 'stop , you banditos !
i don't want to have to hit anyone else . '
but because they were spanish , they didn't understand me .
two more jumped me , and i hit one of them in his " between his legs .
my mouth banged on his head .
and that was where i got my fat lip .
the end .
so where'd you get your fat butt?
andre , that's enough .
that was very nice , jefferson .
excellent use of the first person narrative .
i was scared of the banditos .

he's taken the time out of his busy day to give us a hand .
so give him your attention .
a wrinkle in time is an important book ... and i liked it very much .

excellent choice .
a strong piece of literature , a great read .

this is fiction .
the story's made up .
it's meant to entertain you and make you think .
kofi , you haven't spoken up .
all you've said is you didn't like it .
that's right .
if you can't say more , i'll assume that you didn't really read it ... and your mother's gonna want me to call her .

let's eat .
okay .
why don't we sit?
so , i wanted to talk to you .
yeah , i wanted to talk to you too .
do you want a drink?
no .
what's wrong?
i come here all the time with the guys i work with .
look , i know you don't work at smyth and stevens .
look at you .
i could tell right away you weren't a broker .
what's that mean?
nothing .
you just don't look like you work at smyth and stevens .
you look like a freakin 'boring schoolteacher .
hey , why'd you come here?
to bust me in the lie about where i work?
you win .
you coach my kids .
i thought we had a common interest .
elizabeth , i get paid under the table to coach that team .
and i only do that ...
'cause i'm in a big hole with two bookies who are lookin 'to kill me .
what?
nothing .
you know all this .
i spoke to jimmy fleming after jefferson got beat up .
he told me .
you just think i'm a big joke .
no !
you know , it's people like me that make people like you ... feel better about your tiny life .
this is unbelievable .
i can't believe i came down here for this .
yeah?
then why did you come if you know i'm a liar?
because those kids trust you .
and they don't trust anybody .
i told you , i coach for money .
well , i teach for money .
i've had the best fifth graders in the world , but some don't make it .
there's nobody besides their mother or me telling them what to do .
so what?
i'm done with all that .
well , i just came down here to see what they see ... because they're never wrong .
take a good look .
see what they see .
i came to talk to you about a job .
yeah?
well , unless it pays 12 grand an hour ...
i'm not interested .
did you play it?
yeah .
twelve grand?
yes !
twelve grand .
coach !
can we have a word?
how many points you givin '?
i'm getting six .
you took chicago?
are you on crack?
you laid 12 grand on those  i'm under a lot of pressure .
i said now !
win or lose , i'm outta here .
darryl mackey , league's president .
we met .
coach , we're concerned about the age of some of the boys on your team .
can you produce birth certificates for your players?
all i got is what coach fleming at smyth and stevens gave me .
here they are .
what are the names of those two boys at second base?
andre and jamal .
which one's jamal?
the taller one .
this birth certificate's been altered .
what?
the eight's been turned into a nine .
you have to be born after september of '88 .
well , the kid is out of the league , and the kekambas are on probation .
look , what are you guys the cops?
what's the point of the league , coach?
to teach kids it's okay to lie , as long as they can get away with it?
it should be about these kids playing ball ... not the trophy you bring to work .
look , the kid goes now .
okay?
jefferson bats seventh , plays first base .
miles pitches and bats eighth , and clarence ... you play third and bat ninth .
cool .
okay , let's go .
why i not playin '?
you mad at me?
jamal , the other coach
'cause i'm sorry about pushing ray ray .
i just want to play .
they know you changed your birth certificate .
i can't let you play .
but my mom said it was okay .
she said that she would tell them if they asked .
she said it was okay .
i just wanna play .
there's nothin 'i can do .
look , why don't you just sit
miles , do your stuff now .
strike .
strike !
out .
yeah , baby .
that's what i'm talkin 'about .
time , blue .
i can't have this kid out here with these things on .
what now?
we're just all in agreement .
the kid can't wear headphones while he pitches .
matt makes a good point about safety .
you're kidding me , right?
what if he gets hurt because he can't hear in a dangerous situation?
there's liability issues .
bring it in , fellas .
come on , bring it in .
what are you doing?
i want you guys to explain to them why they lost jamal ... and why miles can't wear headphones ... and why the bua was and the waatas have nice uniforms ... and we have shitty t shirts .
easy , coach .
you're already on a warning .
this is the president ... and that is the coach of the goofiest team in the league .
they kicked jamal out because he was born two weeks early ... and now they're makin 'miles take his headphones off ...
'cause he's pitchin 'too good .
it's a safety issue .
fellas , you understand everyone has to follow the same rules .
that's some weak ass bullshit , you bitch ass , mother freakin 'bustas .
what did you say?
i believe he said , " that is some weak ass bullshit .
was that it , g baby?

we've heard testimony from those very close to our community .
praise jesus .
i want to give a few more people the opportunity to say something on
on jarius's behalf .
please , mr. o'neill .
come on up .
good morning .
jarius was a player on the kekambas baseball team that i coach .
honestly , he he was too young to play .
but he wanted to be a part of the team so badly that ...
i couldn't say no .
g baby .
you're up .
he had a great smile too .
i know i'm not telling you anything you don't know .
i've got jarius evans batting for jefferson tibbs .
he was a really tough guy .
just a boy , really , who ... wanted to be around his older brother .
hang on , coach .
i don't have jarius evans on this roster anywhere .
oh , you know what?
there he is .
he's okay .
the other day ... we played a really important game against a good team .
and , two outs in the last inning ...
i had no choice but to let jarius bat .
you can swing if you want , but you don't have to .
okay?
if you go down looking , none of us care .
but if you want to swing , swing .
get back in there .
do what you feel .
he was fearless as he stepped to the plate .
i was terrified for him .
with two strikes and our hopes dwindling ...
he hit a shot down the first baseline ...
and won the game .
and watching him ... raise his arms in triumph ... as he ran to first base ...
i swear ...
i was lifted in that moment to a better place .
i swear he he lifted the world in that moment .
he made me ... a better person ... even if just for that moment .
i am ... forever grateful to jarius for that .
that was nice ... what you said .
his mother was very moved .
thank you .
wait .
there's some people who want to talk to you about the baseball team .
the team is done .
that's what they want to talk to you about .
they're in the auditorium .
we know the league wants to cancel the championship game .
mom said it was all up to us 'cause of g baby .
yeah .
it's over .
you guys don't have to play .
you guys had a great year .
you can keep the uniforms .
wait .
you're quitting again?
what do you mean?
we wanna play , bitch .
you guys wanna play?
hell , yeah !
for g baby .
i'll see you tomorrow at 11 : 00 .
i came to make sure you guys win .
i even made a bet with your friend , ticky .
knowing ticky bet against us improves our chances .
did you really fill out an application to work at the school?
good luck today .
thank you .
andre , ray ray .
what's up , coach?
why don't you bring everybody in?
hey , y'all , bring it in !
let's go !
i want you guys to take a good look at yourselves today and feel proud .
we made it here .
we're here .
what i've learned from you is that ... really , one of the most important things in life ... is showing up .
i'm blown away by your ability to show up ... through everything that's gone on .
the league never wanted you to play this game ... but you showed up .
but we only have eight players , so
god .
we can't play .
he was my brother .
he loved to watch us play .
he's watching us right now .
we gonna play today .
here you go , kofi .
okay , this is for g baby .
g baby .
