you've sold us a bill of goods , gordon .
promised new drugs to fight everything from the common cold to cancer .
we'll deliver everything we promised .
i'm sorry , but the adventure is over .
we're exercising our option to liquidate ... ... byron & mitchell research limited .
jack , show these people how filthy rich we're gonna make them , please .
i don't think you understand what i just said .
oh , i think i understand .
jack .
perrinia immortalis .
the blood orchid .
first described in 1 892 by houghton ... ... the last person to see it until our team brought a sample from borneo .
it lies dormant for seven years , then blooms for just six months .
which means we just got lucky as hell , gentlemen .
anyone here familiar with the hayflick limit?
he proposed a cell could only replicate 56 times ... ... before it died from a buildup of toxins .
according to him , it's the reason we die .
but what if we could transcend that limit?
that would be impossible .
not according to our data .
our research indicates the presence of a chemical in perrinia immortalis ... ... that can significantly prolong cellular life .
i can't support this .
does that mean what i think it means?
are we talking about a pharmaceutical equivalent ... ... to the fountain of youth?
exactly .
that'd be bigger than viagra .
have you put this into human trials?
we can't yet .
our sample was degraded in the initial study .
we need more of the orchid .
see , and that's our only problem , gentlemen .
that orchid is only in bloom for another two weeks .
well , what the hell are you waiting for?
get your asses down to borneo .
yes .
welcome to borneo .
thanks .
what's wrong with this picture?
i don't know .
let me see , you're in it?
we don't have a boat , okay?
your company had one responsibility : get a boat .
and you've already screwed it up .
wait .
your girl chartered the boat .
sam confirmed with the company .
they're waiting for your payment .
hey .
hey , i've got something .
payment cleared .
really?
where's the boat?
it's not coming .
all of the charter companies have shut down .
no one'll risk going upriver till after the rainy season .
and when's that?
two , three weeks .
the orchid's only in bloom for one more week , tops .
there's a local captain named jin soon .
i'm told he'll take anyone upriver , for the right price .
are you sure this is the place?
they said the one with the red door .
i bet you somebody's playing russian roulette in there .
maybe we'll get lucky and you'll get a turn .
hey , why don't you two just get a room .
come on , sam .
wait here .
yeah , if you insist .
hey !
hey !
jin soon .
jin soon?
your lndonesian sucks .
stick to english .
we heard you could take us upriver .
in rainy season?
won't be cheap .
we can pay you 25, 000 .
i'll have a talk with the captain .
you're not the captain?
jin soon !
these tourists need a boat .
i told them not in the rainy season .
you're jin soon?
local nickname .
name's johnson .
bill johnson .
it's a pronunciation thing .
and you can rent my boat for 25 grand .
now , you want me to drive it , well ... ... that'll cost you 50 .
fifty grand?
are you high?
you know what?
don't answer that .
i'm not trusting him with the expedition .
listen .
lady .
let's cut the bullshit , please .
if one of the other charter companies could take you ... ... you'd be on the river by now .
you only came to me because you're desperate .
fifty grand's my price .
take it ... ... or leave it .
i've seen subway cars in better shape than this .
yeah , she may be ugly ... ... but she puts out .
shit !
what took you so long?
hey , you try getting a gps locator , a sat nav echostar ... ... and a uv spectrometer past lndonesian customs .
complaining already .
yeah .
you rather be back in the office?
hell , yeah .
i had courtside seats at the garden on saturday .
i was gonna sit right between spike and woody .
oh , man , is that our ride? !
look at the bright side , cole .
at least the weather's nice .
ben douglas , team doctor .
you must be sam .
yeah .
we spoke on the phone .
glad to have you aboard .
i'm gonna get you for this .
oh , yeah .
this could be fun .
you can forget about that , dog .
that's one car you ain't never gonna catch .
there's always a way .
your team's a little green , huh?
my former grad students .
best in their field .
you want the best young talent ... ... recruit early .
yes , i'm sure sam's very talented .
i think i resent that .
you and the other gal can stay in here .
you live here .
the way you say that , i can tell you're impressed .
all right .
if you need anything ....
well ... ... if you need anything , you're shit out of luck .
okay .
now , this is where the exploratory team found the orchid .
in the selatan basin .
it took them three days to get upriver .
yeah .
that was before the rainy season .
these waterways could be dangerous now .
you said you'd get us there safely .
and i will .
but safe isn't always quick .
we'll work our way up one bend at a time .
if i don't like what i see , we change course .
can't chart the fastest route before you begin .
already have .
check it .
all right .
now , we're uplinked in real time to nasa and asiasatcom .
now , under ideal conditions ... ... this is the fastest route .
but once we superimpose weather patterns for the past 1 0 years ... ... and then extrapolate ....
bingo !
it's padrang to the selatan basin .
i'm a bad man .
we got less than a week to get to that orchid .
if you can't get the job done , give our money back ...
... and we'll get somebody who can .
i'll get you there .
god help me .
something attacked me !
oh , my god !
she said something attacked her .
no , no , no !
it's okay .
it's okay .
what the hell'd you do?
you scared him .
i scared him? !
this is kong .
kong lives here .
you're guests .
be nice .
disgusting animal .
you okay now?
i'm fine .
just keep your hands off of me .
oh , yeah .
well , it's gonna be tough , but i'll try .
no , no , the s 1 has to be on file before the week is out .
that's the whole point .
hello?
the s 1 needs to be on file before ....
yes , we were able to get on the river .
that's the purpose .
we need the comments from the sec .
excuse me .
it's the only place i can get reception .
no , just get it done .
be ready to go ....
no , that's impossible ....
hello?
hello?
damn !
hello?
bob?
damn it !
try my phone .
works just as good , but it's free .
okay .
maybe you can use my special antenna to boost your reception .
we're dealing with a lithophytic vine , so we want to search any rock face .
now , this ridge here seems a good bet .
sam .
come on , sam .
what do you say?
we're young .
we're single .
we're in borneo .
what do you got to lose?
not satisfied , walk away .
no commitments .
no commitments .
that's your pitch?
did i say " no commitments "?
i meant marry me .
am i gonna be dealing with this for the next two weeks?
yep .
so you were one of jack's students?
yeah .
he was teaching a seminar on botanical pharmacology .
soon as i finished my dissertation , he hired me .
well , that's one way to get a leg up .
what's that supposed to mean?
i had a professor who wanted to hire me .
of course , he wanted me to be his secretary .
look , if i've done something to offend you
no .
no , dear , not at all .
actually , i admire you .
took me 1 0 years to get where i am .
clearly , your generation has it figured out .
man , this is good .
where'd you learn to cook like this?
little recipe i picked up in sri lanka .
what were you doing there?
doctors without borders .
it's my day job .
you guys expect to need a doctor?
can't get the expedition bonded without one .
well , you just think of me as a charming insurance policy .
hey !
you've had your dinner .
get out of here .
what'd i say?
there's not that much ....
i'm not sleeping up there .
i ain't sleeping on the floor .
i ain't sleeping on no damn ....
oh , shit .
what was that?
what the hell was that?
something's getting eaten .
by what?
everything gets eaten out here .
it's the jungle .
kong .
hey .
you guys seen kong?
no .
not since last night .
where are you?
kong?
we need those results by next month if we want the fda off our backs .
hello?
shit !
i can't hear you !
can you hear me now?
how about now?
can you hear me now?
can you hear me now?
we can !
can you hear me now?
gail !
oh , my god .
shit .
stop the boat !
i'll go .
all right .
hey , gail !
can you hear me now? !
oh , i'm gonna kill you !
stroke , gail , stroke .
come on .
watch your back .
hey , gail !
how's the water?
drop the phone .
it's probably holding you back .
all right .
stay calm .
stay calm .
use your phone for flotation .
all right , come on , gail .
you're almost there .
it's just like a phone .
i got it .
holy shit !
holy shit !
come on !
come on !
get out !
hurry up !
hurry up !
hurry up !
come on !
come on !
gail , grab it .
look out !
watch out !
oh , my god .
get him , bill !
get him , bill !
get him in the eye , man !
bill?
where'd he go?
where'd he go? !
bill !
i don't see him .
where's he gone?
oh , my god .
oh , shit , you won .
you're okay?
i lost my phone .
sorry to hear it .
that was either the bravest or the stupidest thing i've ever seen .
it's a fine line .
good as new .
thanks .
to gail ... ... who knows it's better to eat than be eaten .
to gail .
yeah , yeah , baby .
almost eaten just to find a flower .
hardly seems worth it .
oh , it's worth it .
i mean , think about it .
a pill that you take every day for the rest of your life .
now , even if we charge , say , a dollar a pop ... ... we're billionaires .
yeah .
that's what i'm talking about , baby .
at $1 00 a bottle ... ... i'll dive in that river and fight that croc myself .
so how many flowers does it take to save the world?
figure 50 orchids will yield about an ounce of chemical .
you could have a football field full of those orchids ... ... still doesn't mean you can get it through human trials .
she doesn't even believe in you .
comes with the territory .
in research , you've got to go out on a limb .
and there's always someone waiting to chop it off .
where the hell have you been?
damn that thing !
where you been , boy?
calm down .
calm down .
poor guy .
it's okay .
it's all right .
looks like he's seen a ghost .
it's all right .
it's all right .
it's all right .
what if gail's right?
i mean , cells in a petri dish are one thing .
human trials are another .
she's wrong .
and when it goes to product ... ... and you and i can cash in our stock options ...
... we'll rub her face in it .
stock options .
i spoke to mitchell .
we're each giving you half a point .
i don't know what to say .
don't say anything .
you deserve it .
all this ... ... wouldn't be possible without your work .
jack .
thought we decided against that .
yeah .
yeah .
you're right .
it would be fun , though .
i mean , here we are , traveling upriver ... ... to the greatest discovery of our careers .
now , if this orchid thing works out , then ... ... who knows?
is that why i'm here?
so you can give us one more try?
you're here because you're the best researcher i've got .
am i interrupting something?
no .
no , i was ....
i was just going to bed .
yeah .
well , before you do that , we need to talk .
we got a problem .
see the water level?
in high water , the mendranang gets rough .
we could turn around , try to find another course .
but that would take at least two days .
we don't have the time .
if the river becomes impassable , it'll take a lot longer .
and if we turn back , then we're definitely screwed .
we're gonna have to risk it .
what if i don't wanna risk it?
do you have any idea what this flower means?
we're talking about the biggest medical discovery in history .
that does sound great , jack .
but i was never any good at history .
you want me to risk the mendranang ... ... it'll cost you an extra 50 thousand .
done .
done?
you gotta ask the boss lady or something?
i'll pay it myself .
all right .
you got yourself a deal .
but if we hit trouble ... ... your people do what i say , you got that?
you're the captain .
research proposals?
yeah .
research proposals .
you're not the only company we're in bed with .
we're the prettiest and most popular .
like sleeping with the head cheerleader .
not quite .
come on , you know you love us .
i love your cash .
then let me get a look at that file .
after this orchid thing goes bust , you'll be finished at wexell hall .
unless you got something else lined up .
you really wanna see us fail , don't you?
no .
i just think that you will .
i am a scientist , you know .
scientist .
what're you doing at wexell hall?
i like science .
i just like money better .
i'll drink to that .
river's flooded .
we can't see the banks .
miss our turnoff?
it's just ahead .
what the hell was that?
rudder's jammed .
what?
watch out .
shit !
get up !
everybody up !
hey .
what's going on?
goddamn it .
shit !
we've blown the head gasket .
are we all right?
hey , what's going on?
what is it?
we got problems .
what's wrong , man?
bill , wait .
what are you talking about?
what problems?
son of a bitch .
the current's too strong .
we missed our turnoff .
i know .
come on , baby .
come on , man .
what is it?
what is it?
what do you see?
come on .
you got this .
come on , girl .
everybody !
hang on !
hang on to what? !
come on !
oh , shit !
holy shit .
it's sinking , it's sinking !
where's cole?
swim to the rocks , this way .
keep going .
come on , get to the rocks .
get to the rocks .
where's cole?
cole !
over there .
over there !
over there !
come on , man .
give me your hand !
come on .
you got it , sam .
come on .
give me your hand .
i've got you , i've got you .
give me your hand , give me your hand .
okay , i got her .
you almost got us killed !
you almost got us killed !
you think i wanted this?
i just lost my damn boat !
you'll lose your pay if you don't get us out .
you said you'd get us there safely .
you should've turned around .
that's enough !
there's nothing we can do about that now .
it's a waste of energy .
what have we got?
some specimen jars , a map , a little water , no food .
hard drive's ruined .
well , pretty much all the equipment's shot .
except one of the sat phones still works .
it's on line .
thank god , we can call the police .
police .
the nearest river patrol is back in padrang .
the only way to get to us is over that .
are you saying we're stuck here?
maybe not .
we're here .
the valley's completely flooded .
but i got a friend who operates a boat on the tokut river .
i can give him a call , and he can meet us here at naga rock .
how far is that?
i don't know .
a two day hike down the river .
but if we bushwhack , we cut at least a day off the trek .
oh , my god .
you wanna go through that?
it's the shortest way .
we could be safely in the tokut by nightfall .
so we can continue with the expedition .
yeah .
i'll get you to the flower .
i don't care about that flower ...
... just get us to safety .
it's the same thing .
we can either be on my buddy's boat in 1 0 hours , or we can sit here ... ... and wait for the river patrol for days .
your friend .
is he reliable?
absolutely .
you better not screw me on this .
sounds like you're already screwed , mate .
pay you two grand .
i need you on this one , john .
yes , yes , so it seems .
look , billy , i'd love to help you out , but i'm flat out , mate , you know .
probably squeeze you in for , say , 5 grand?
you're killing me .
that's mates rates .
or you could always ... ... hike back to padrang if you wanna save bucks .
up to you , pal .
fine .
five .
yes !
but you better be there .
otherwise , i'll tell your wife about that little trip to bangkok .
wife's long gone , billy .
long gone , mate .
all right , people , we're on .
saddle up .
stay together .
this jungle is all green all the time , and you will get lost .
it's like doing a stairmaster in a sauna .
yeah .
i might die of a heat stroke , but i'll have a nice tight ass .
that's the spirit , cole .
you want me to grab that?
ls that a trick question?
here , man .
right between spike and woody .
right between spike and woody .
you okay , sam?
i'm fine .
see , a crisis separates the real men from the pretenders .
yeah .
can see that .
what , that?
that's nothing .
i tricked him into taking my bag .
hey .
mind if i give it a try?
knock yourself out .
hey .
i'm sorry about your boat .
yeah , well ... ... it was a piece of shit anyway .
can we go around?
yeah , we could .
but we'd lose another day .
let's go .
shit .
hey .
knock it off .
shit !
what was that?
what was what?
something just moved .
please don't say that .
i'm serious .
something moved .
something just moved " as in something's alive?
shit !
there it is again .
there's something in here !
there's probably a million things in here .
he's right .
just keep moving .
stop it .
i swear to god , if you don't stop it ....
very funny .
ben?
where'd he go?
shit !
help me !
run !
what the hell was that thing? !
anaconda .
oh , great !
there's snakes out here that big?
yes , but  but what?
it swallowed him whole !
calm down and listen for a second .
i can explain
no , you calm down and listen !
ben was eaten by a freaking snake .
okay?
a freaking snake !
cole .
oh , god .
oh , my god .
i mean ....
cole .
oh , my god , did you see that thing?
we don't got a chance against that !
i mean , mitchell .
mitchell .
listen to me , man .
i watch the discovery channel .
i'm telling you , we got no chance !
we're like mice in an aquarium .
you understand?
i mean , we're gonna die , girl .
we're gonna die !
cole , calm down .
okay?
okay?
all right , jack , i'm okay .
okay .
i'll just ....
i'm gonna
i'm gonna sit right here .
i'm sorry .
sorry .
listen .
anacondas are territorial .
a snake that size will hunt a huge area .
there won't be another one for miles .
we gotta get to the boat .
it's not that far .
so if we keep moving and stick together ... ... we should be fine .
we should be? !
how big do they get?
that was the biggest one i've ever seen by far .
a freak of nature .
the odds of running into another that size are astronomical .
yeah , but how do we know the one that got ben ... ... is not gonna come after us?
it takes them weeks to digest .
meal like that , he'll be sleeping it off for a while .
let's just get to that boat and get home .
what about the orchid?
you've gotta be kidding me .
it won't bloom for another seven years .
this expedition is over , jack .
now , hold on a second , gail .
there's a lot of money at stake here .
i don't care .
ben is dead !
we have lost someone .
as wexell hall's representative , i am calling this expedition off .
you don't have the authority .
check your contract .
we're in the middle of the jungle .
at this point , your authority is what we say it is .
jack , i'm with her .
i gotta get the hell out of here , man .
look .
ben was my friend , okay?
i got him into this , and no one feels worse about it than i do .
i don't wanna do anything stupid .
i just wanna accomplish what we came here for .
if we turn back now , ben's death would be for nothing .
let's just get back to the boat .
we can regroup and make our decision then .
fine .
jack .
maybe gail's right .
she's just scared .
once we get back to the boat , she'll be okay .
when we get back to the boat , this expedition is over .
i'm taking these people to safety .
hey , hey , hey .
we had a deal .
keep your money , doc .
someone is dead .
we're officially in over our heads .
you said we wouldn't run into another one of them .
and we probably won't , but i can't guarantee it .
so i'll get you to the boat ... ... and after that we're done .
well , that answers it .
that answers nothing .
i'll just throw more money at him at the boat .
if he doesn't take it , i'll offer his friend the same deal .
jack .
maybe we should listen  lf we don't get to that orchid now ... ... all of our work will have been for nothing .
i need your support , okay?
you have as much riding on this as i do .
don't let me down .
i saw this special on animal planet .
anacondas are vicious .
they hunt for sport .
don't even need to see you .
just use their tongues to sense body heat
shut the hell up .
i knew this guy who knew this guy who shot documentaries .
he went to the amazon with this crew , and they were all eaten by snakes .
come on , you knew a guy who knew a guy , that's an urban myth .
i'm sorry about ben .
i never should've stayed on the mendranang .
what do you mean?
well , i figured he didn't tell the others , but i thought you knew .
knew what?
byron offered me an extra 50 grand to stay on the river .
i told him it might get rough , but he wanted to risk it .
hey .
don't blame him .
it was my call .
i took the money .
i thought i could get us through .
you wanna blame anyone?
you blame me .
these boots are killing me .
cole .
what?
you got some ....
oh , god , what is that? !
get it off !
get it off !
oh , my god !
take it off !
relax .
help me !
help me !
hold on .
get it off me !
hey !
calm down !
get this off me !
calm down !
cole !
cole !
calm down .
what is it?
what is it?
get it off me .
get it off .
all right .
look .
just a lighter .
just a lighter .
oh , hell no !
you ain't burning me !
okay .
okay .
okay .
you burn me , i'll kill you .
okay , okay , okay .
all right .
you all right?
you okay?
yeah .
i'm fine .
what?
hold on .
put your arms up .
what are you doing?
why are you going under my shirt?
what are you doing?
jesus .
what , what?
what is it?
what is it?
what is it?
anybody got a blowtorch?
stop !
careful .
what's it?
lf that thing bit you ... ... you would be lumpuh .
paralyzed , like stone , for two days .
what do you call this fella?
laba laba batu .
stone spider .
i may have discovered a valuable new anesthetic agent for wexell hall .
oh , no , no , no .
forget wexell , we can get this to the highest bidder .
all right .
show and tell's over .
we gotta get to that boat .
put your boots on and let's go .
bugger it .
what the hell was that?
holy bloody hell .
whoa !
what was that?
oh , my god .
what the hell was that?
come on .
no , no , no !
oh , come on , man !
what the hell happened? !
livingston !
here we go .
he got drunk and fell off the bloody boat !
your friend !
your friend !
now what we gonna do now? !
shit !
search the wreckage .
find anything we can use .
and hope to god there's a phone .
come on , come on .
yes .
hello?
hello?
come on , come on !
anything?
nothing .
keep trying .
what do you think i'm doing , jack? !
hello?
shit .
hello?
come on , man .
hello?
all right , keep looking !
no phone?
nothing .
couldn't get a signal on the radio .
now what?
what's going on?
where'd these come from?
lopaks .
who?
local tribe .
descended from headhunters .
what?
been in this region for thousands of years .
headhunters?
there's still some villages here .
must be one of their fishing spots .
hold on , excuse me .
did you say headhunters?
there haven't been practicing headhunters in borneo for a century .
just because they ain't practicing don't mean they don't remember how .
they must be along this branch of the river .
if we can find their village , maybe they can lend us a boat .
so wait a minute .
we just gonna walk towards the headhunters , not away?
yeah .
yeah , yeah , that makes sense .
oh , god .
i'm so hungry , i'd sell my grandmother for a tic tac .
you mention food one more time ... ... i'm voting you off this island .
oh , god .
ls that?
livingston .
oh , my god , man .
what the hell happened to him?
anaconda .
if he was eaten by the snake ...
... why is his body?
listen , listen !
all right .
these things are at their weakest when they digest .
but if threatened , they will spit up their food and attack again .
what?
there's a snake out there with an empty stomach?
yeah .
the same one that got ben?
no .
no .
there's no way that snake could've gotten to livingston .
it had to be another one .
you said there wouldn't be ...
... another one for miles .
there wouldn't .
unless ....
unless what?
unless it's mating season .
oh , my god .
mating season?
yeah .
you see , the males are territorial , but when they smell a female in heat ... ... they come running from everywhere .
females find a nice , wet , muddy pit , and they all go after her at once ... ... in one big mating ball .
so there's some snake orgy out in the jungle? !
yeah .
something like that .
look , we're losing the light .
all we gotta do is get to that village .
so please , pay attention .
do not stray from the group .
let's go .
stay quiet .
sacred burial ground .
jesus .
i thought you said that anaconda was the biggest you'd ever seen .
it was .
well , this one's ....
bigger .
the males must've come through here looking for the female .
some bullshit .
they took their boats .
good for them .
bad for us .
which one's the mendranang?
on the right .
the tokut keeps going to the left .
fastest way to kotabaru .
how long?
you'll be soaking in a tub at the four seasons in two days .
how , man?
we don't even have a boat .
we're gonna build one .
man , do that in my neighborhood , and that's your ass .
shit .
sam .
what does this look like to you?
my god .
perrinia immortalis .
now we know why these snakes are so big .
what?
anacondas keep growing till they die , right?
and these are the biggest bill's ever seen .
because they're living longer .
exactly .
because perrinia immortalis is part of the food chain .
these snakes have transcended the hayflick limit .
the chemical in the orchid does exactly what we predicted .
and not in theory , in the real world .
this is proof , sam , of your research , carved in stone .
this is proof?
it's anecdotal evidence at best .
let's get to the orchid and find out .
you are out of your mind .
do you have any idea how close we are?
the orchid was found here ... ... on the mendranang , just around the next bend .
we'll be going right past it .
no , we won't .
we are going down the tokut .
if we go down the mendranang , it's gonna be a week ... ... before we reach another village .
i'm not waiting that long for my bath .
yeah , well , it's not up to you .
jack .
maybe you can just come back .
come back?
in seven years?
what if it's not here?
what if some local farmer decides to slash and burn the entire basin?
instead of the fountain of youth , we'll have a giant rice paddy .
this is our only chance .
you know it is .
do you wanna give in when we're this close?
look .
you know i got your back , right?
we've been in the trenches a hundred times together .
but i'm not going in that jungle .
damn straight , man .
thank you .
this is my expedition , and we're going to the orchid .
no .
we're not .
don't be an idiot , sam .
this is bigger than penicillin , for god's sake .
lives will be saved by this drug .
people will live longer .
they'll stay young longer .
if we don't put this to human trials , it'll be a crime against humanity .
two people have died already .
scientists have always risked their lives to change the world .
if they didn't , we wouldn't have cures for yellow fever , polio and smallpox .
we all knew the risks .
we thought we did .
until you decided to start making decisions behind our backs .
what are you talking about?
he offered bill an extra 50 grand ... ... to keep going , even though he knew it wasn't safe .
oh , my god .
is that true , jack?
i was thinking of the expedition .
you were thinking of your career .
look .
you're my assistant .
i don't need to consult you !
i'm the one with the authority here .
we're in the middle of the jungle , jack .
at this point , your authority is what we say it is .
guess you got a mutiny on your hands .
thank you .
okay .
keep it high .
careful .
center it right here .
all right .
what are you doing?
never seen a man shave before?
probably a lot sharper before you attacked that alligator .
crocodile .
what's that mean?
that means " a new beginning .
it's korean .
i got it when i was in the military .
what brought you here?
long story .
where am i gonna go?
all right .
here's the deal .
i was in the special forces ... ... and i saw and did things ... ... that i wanted to forget .
sometimes we do the wrong things for the right reasons , you know?
it's not very long , as stories go .
yeah .
well , i got out of the military ... ... came here and bought the bloody mary .
just wanted to start a new life .
thank you , jack .
on three .
ready?
one , two , three .
it works .
all right .
let me explain .
why in the hell didn't you tell me about this?
the minute someone makes a call ... ... this expedition's over .
exactly .
all i'm asking for is a few more hours .
we continue on the mendranang ... ... take our orchid samples , then we call for help .
forget about it , jack .
i'm getting us out of here .
think about this , gordon .
you're about to become a billionaire .
do you really want to give all that up?
i don't care about the money , all right?
i wanna live .
it bit me .
jack , what are you ...?
what are you ...?
help .
help .
help me .
where's mitchell?
resting his feet .
should i go get him?
no , no .
let him rest till we get loaded .
okay .
those blisters are pretty nasty .
mitchell ... ... you okay?
mitchell?
what is it?
tell me .
what did you do to him , jack?
what is it?
something's wrong with mitchell .
what are you talking about?
you were alone with him .
what did you do?
he was resting his feet .
i didn't do anything .
shit .

fyl , bill , the raft is gone !
we can get it back .
how? !
how?
we gonna swim after it now?
look ... ... the village is here .
jack is following the mendranang .
we cut across the jungle .
we can catch him on the other side .
right .
catch him where?
he's going to that orchid .
we find that flower ... ... we find that raft .
oh , thank god .
it's jack byron .
oh , thank god .
it's jack byron .

we took the wrong way on the mendranang .
we went over a waterfall .
i haven't seen anyone since .
