i've never had a boyfriend , sir .
well , if you had one .

i would get him , like , la llorona .
they're all waiting in the conference room .
what?
the momento account .
ms. james?
you rpresentation?
after months o fresearch in our key three cities ...
miami , chicago and new york .
we are convinced that momento will be a tremendous domestic success ... which we can platform into international markets .
this perfume embodies the many attributes of a woman ... strength andintelligence ,,,
uh , sassiness and sexuality ...
also class ... and beauty .
enough !
enough !
i love you !
i love you all !
i love you !
i do !
what?
what?
well , your blood pressure is very high , tomas .
what seems to be the problem now?
pain in my left eye .
i'm light headed , dizzy .
it's like there's no blood reaching my brain .
ah , well , sounds like stress .
uh , work problems?
uh , i'm dating three women .
well , guess we know where all the blood is then .
i didn't plan this !
all three are so different ... so beautiful , so ... so special .
you'd better choose one , or you're gonna wearyourself out .
how can you choose between the colors of nature's beautiful flowers?
how?
besides , they'd be heartbroken , and i'd be dead .
well , you may die from exhaustion .
so , um , what are their names?
cici , patricia y lorena .
i'm married to a woman named bertha .
bertha?
hmm .
choose one .
now , what name are you hoping for?
i don't know .
who is it?
what matters is who are you hoping it is?
quick !
uh , i don't know .
who is it?
that's your conscious self talking .
your subconscious knows what you really want .
quick !
can'tyou just read it?
please?
that's not the point .
your blood pressure is way too high .
we'll try some tranquilizers until you can work everything out .
until then , no driving , no alcohol and , most important ...
no women .
what?
i'm gonna write one for myself .
now take out the third and seventh paragraphs .
yes .
give me one second .
okay .
now read it back to me .
the rest sounds fine .
have them sign and circulate it .
amor?
thank you .
you're welcome .
sit .
good girl .
agent quinn?
yeah , it's carmen , yeah , she just pulled up to someone's house .
uh , no .
i don't think it's one of theirs .
you stay .
good dog !
surprise , papi !
what's going on?
what's happening?
what are you doing in my lingerie?
your lingerie?
open your fake eyes , honey !
he obviously gave this little number to all of us .
but only one of us is doing it justice !
but he's mine !
he's mine !
then , why is he in miami on monday giving me this?
well , tuesday he was in chicago .
wednesday , new york .
este walter told me that a venus hootchie was moving in on my man !
what doyou mean your man?
not that i would ever watch ... what's his name?
walter?
i assure you that hootchie venus he was referring to is not me .
it's you !
and you !
this is ludicrous .
tomas would not cheat on me ... with some bookworm and a maid .
i'm the maid , and i'm gonna wipe the floor with you !
this whole thing's so absurd !
especially , since tomas and i are engaged .
tomas fuentes bought you that ring?
yeah .
nice !
cubic zirconium .
for 10 bucks i can get you a matching pair of earrings .
wait a minute , that's a ... that's a pinky ring !
you better get back to the castle , princess , before you turn into a pumpkin !
well , at least it's real , which is more than i can say for some ... other things in this room .
that's it !
i'll shove your tiara right upyour ...
hold it !
hold it !
psycho .
this is just perfect !
tomas fuentes cheats on us , and we fight with each other?
this man , as we have witnessed ,,, he is deceiving , he is conniving ... and he is untrustworthy !
have we no pride , girls?
he doesn't deserve us !
i'm with the bookworm .
my mom always said ...
lfa man cheats on you , he doesn't respect you .
i propose that we walk out ofhere , and we never look back .
we should wait here and give him a heart attack .
no , no , no , no .
we must cease and desist of all contact whatsoever .
that's what he deserves .
cracked huevos is what he deserves .
but i like your plan ... it's subtle .
and subtle's your middle name .
as of this moment , we agree to be honest in our intention ... to abandon tomas fuentes .
we swear on our oath as honorable women .
who taught you to talk like that?
agreed?
agreed .
good .
i'm lorena morales .
i'm cici .
just " cici "?
like charo .
like cher .
que ridiculez , i am patricia sofia ... whatever !
ordonez coronado del pescador .
ay , she must be european !
remember , we've got to be strong .
because we deserve more than this .
i don't care how many times he tries .
i will not take his call , neither will i.
i wonderwho he will call first .
i mean ...
i know it won't be me .
if he can have you two , what would he want with a chica like me?
pues , ciao , muijeres ,
well , i guess , this is good bye .
yes , good bye .
if he can have you two , what would he want with a chica like me?
tomas needs intellectual stimulation .
and culture .
he wouldn't go for the ...
blond with the boobs ...
would he?
would he?
romeo meo romeo meo rome romeo rome romeo
okay , tomas .
it's time to relax .
mi amor , i was just thinking about you .
really?
may i come in?
of course , my sweet .
where are my manners?
oh , i don't know .
perhaps you left them in new york ... or , maybe , miami?
isn't it trueyou were in both of those cities recently?
very recently , in fact .
uh , yes , for my work , amor , oh , your work .
no other reason , tomas?
i don't know what you mean?
i thinkyou do .
mi amor ...
no me toques , querida , go upstairs .
i will make you a drink , okay?
i'm gonna have more questions foryou , tomas !
i'll be right there ,
what was she saying ... new york and miami?
oh , my god !
no way .
no way .
now , stay calm .
breathe , tomas .
just breathe .
patricia , i was just thinking about you .
how could you , tomas?
i thought you had better taste than a librarian and some sort of ... a prostitute !
what areyou talking about?
who are those drinks for?
for me?
two drinks?
yes .
so i don't have to come back for a refill .
see?
mmm .
come into the kitchen .
i will fix two foryou .
federal express .
i'll be right back .
this can't be happening .
oh , my god .
it is happening .
ay , cici !
you've been very , very bad , cabron !
mamita .
take a good look at me , papi .
feast your eyes on what you're losing and forwhat?
it's not what you think .
some stuck up , pinche ,,, ice princess and a mousey little office clerk !
i hope it was worth it !
i can explain .
listen .
because you're don't get these chichis tonight !
well , i'm back at this house , but something funny is going on .
aha !
you came back !
i knew i couldn't trust a tramp like you !
you liar !
liar?
me?
your fake eyed , funny named , culo crawled back before i did !
what have you done to him !
the librarian?
i am a lawyer !
oh , you tricked us !
i didn't .
" and we deserve more than this , " my ass !
i did it ...
so you could have tomas for yourself .
big word talker !
i didn't plan to come back !
it was just ... damn it , it was cici's chichis !
tramp !
pendeijas !
underachievers .
sounds like it's getting violent .
wait .
what are we doing?
what are we doing?
trying not to kill somebody .
please don't kill me .
i didn't mean to .
shh .
quinn quinn ... i can't hear anything .
leave your man wanting more .
we're gonna need more than that , papi .
i won't shareyou .
make a choice , tomas , choose or you die .
i choose ...
i ...
i choose .
tomas !
what are you doing?
i have to make sure he's okay !
he might need c . p . r .
if anyone's gonna give tomas the breath of life , it's gonna be me !
get your mouth out of there !
this dead chico is mine !
look at this .
look at this .
they were prescribed today !
he took half of it !
oh , these are just tranquilizers .
he'll sleep it off . , and what do we do now?
what can we do?
we're gonna wait here till he gets up and he chooses me !
i mean , he makes a decision , all right?

i'm a cocktail waitress .
i was thinking about getting a job too .
anyway , i really want to be a dancer ,
ihe kind with the pole?
no !
a real dancer .
everything i know , i taught myself .
and that's hard to put on a resume .
i know what people think when they look at me ,
i may not look smart , but i'm full of surprises .
but what about you , miss puerto rico?
how come you're a lawyer and you have no dinero?
because i work for the people .
what people?
our people ,
i fight the fight for rights for all latinos ,
i fight against discrimination .
i fight against inequality .
i fight for the people who have no voice !
que bueno , you should save that for the beauty contest tomorrow .
you know that i've ...
i've never been in a beauty contest before .
and you're not in one now .
being a fake beauty contestant is better than a fake maid .
tomorrow , can i be miss puerto rico and lorena be the maid?
and now , the moment we've all been waiting for .
and the winner is ...
miss lorena !
yea , lorena !
way to go , lorena !
come on , lorena !
you're hot , baby !
lorena morales , do you swear to be my only , my one and only ... and nothing but my one and only so help you god?
i do !
lorena , yeah !
you're my love , and i won't share you with anyone .
this is ridiculous .
i should be going to the ball , not those tacky , ugly hags .
help me with my dress !
the buckle on my shoe is loose !
fix it !
would you hurry?
i don't want to miss the prince .
may i have some water?
i am so thirsty from my travels .
you got it , prince .
certainly .
you're so very beautiful .
i am , aren't i?
and i'm wasting away in this horrible dungeon .
would you like to ride away with me?
more than anything .
let's go .
my papi .
yes , tomas?
how dare you?
how dare me?
how dare you !
keep your hands off the merchandise !
oh , you wish .
hello?
yes .
yes , miss puerto rico .
correct .
oh , i'm sorry .
i'll be right down . what happened?
i missed my brunch !
okay , i'm meeting the judges .
it's 11 : 30 !
it's 11 : 30?
move it .
we have to go .
where?
we have to take the car to fala's boyfriend's friend .
it's a long story .
i have to meet the judges .
no , you don't .
and why should we go with you?
because we're in this together , because we have a common bond ... and because i don't trust either one of you ... alone with tomas .
okay .
fine .
then , i'll just go downstairs ... and spill the frijoles on little miss puerto rico .
i'm sure motel 6 will have a room .
we're in .
well , what about tomas?
what if he wakes up?
still out like a light .
we'll leave fifi here to guard him .
come on , fifi .
let me help you get your favorite toy .
good girl !
this is so bizarre .
i could've sworn i put it in here .
i have a better idea .
hotel security .
baby , i'm chasing papi , chasing papi .
baby , i'm chasing papi , chasing papi .
now we have to wait for some guy named rodrigo .
we have to wait?
in this heat?
is the sun too bright for your pretty , fake blue eyes?
what's that supposed to mean?
only that someone in this car is ashamed of being latina .
i'm not ashamed of being latina .
i can't believe i'm missing the pageant for this .
you're not in the pageant !
all right , all right .
there's the car .
let's go .
okay .
okay , just a minute .
what?
just a minute .
i gotta take these pills before the novocaine wears off .
you can't stand a little toothache?
shoot !
it ... it's a root canal .
it's the most painful thing you could have .
haven't you ever heard of people saying ...
rather have a root canal , " when they don't want to do something?
no , but you would rather have two root canals than to blow this deal .
look here , victor .
tonight is the night .
we make this pickup , and then we are in with the big boys .
are you almost finished?
let's ... let's go .
okay .
okay .
i'm miserable , you know?
you could be a little more sensitive .
ladies , you are late .
rodrigo .
the last thing i picture you doing on the internet is buying a car .
here .
great car .
really roomy .
the radio sticks a little bit .
where's the bag?
what?
where is the bag?
the bag?
where is the bag?
the bag with the money .
oh , my god .
was it supposed to be in the trunk?
look , don't play with me , little girl .
i object to you calling her a little girl .
and who the hell are you?
i am a woman with a conscience .
you're about to be a woman without a pulse , if we don't get that bag back .
it's back at our hotel .
yeah .
i didn't know about a bag of luggage .
well , i don't .
why did you say it?
i'm stalling .
this is all your fault .
what are they talking about?
okay , okay .
okay .
please !
break it up .
man !
please , okay?
you know?
every time women get together they go like this all the time .
we're just gonna go to the hotel , get the bag ... and we're gonna bring it to you .
yes .
not so fast , senorita smiles .
victor's coming with you .
huh?
no , no , no .
that's really not necessary .
he coming too?
wha ...
i ...
hey , hey , hey .
i gotta put ice on my jaw , okay?
i really don't wanna take a ride with them , all right?
you know what?
you are going , unless you wanna stay here and explain this to the boss .
and i know you don't really wanna do that , do you?
nice move .
is that a plan?
what are we gonna do when we get to the room and there's no money?
yeah , then what?
you got us into this mess .
here we are .
there's a note !
here , i'll get it .
i'll get it .
if you want your papi back , bring the money to the don quixote puppet ... at the l. a. latin festival at 5 : 00 p . m . , no cops .
no cops?
l. a. latin festival ... this is all your fault .
why is everything my fault?
it's not my fault .
hey , hey !
keep it down , please .
where is the bag , because that's not the bag .
it's full of underwears and stuff .
where's the bag?
we didn't have to leave tomas to return stupid car ... you're miss perfect .
nothing is ever your fault !
shut up !
shut up so i can think .
please !
what?
i live in new york .
no one touches my bag .
it's like i'm seeing you for the very first time .
that was good .
but where is tomas?
and who are these thugs and what was in that car?
i don't know , but i'm going to find out .
conga room .
fala .
cici !
i need to find that jerk , ricky .
i don't know where he is .
are you in l. a.?
have you see the hollywood sign?
he set us up .
do you know about a bag of money that was supposed to be in the car?
no .
ricky wouldn't do anything like that .
he doesn't have any money .
have you seen any movie stars?
i don't have time for this .
good bye .
take pic ...
well?
well?
we have to find out how to get to this festival .
miss puerto rico !
we've been calling and calling !
i was so worried !
i love your glasses !
but this is a beauty contest .
lose them !
it's just you and me .
let's go .
excuse me !
we need a map of the area .
how nice to have you back .
shall we give it another go?
that was just a little misunderstanding .
of course .
what about the map?
whose adorable dog is that?
hotel policy does not allow ... our four legged family members to stay with us .
fifi , what's wrong?
oh , i've seen a lot , but this one's a real doozy .
no , i think he'll prove very useful to us .
yeah .
okay , i'll see you there .
i'm just gonna make sure they make it there too .
okay .
bye .
and worldpeace .
excuse me .
miss mexico , how would you define beauty?
i believe beauty does come from within ... but why not let your beauty show on the outside ... and share it with the whole world?
if you got it , flaunt it .
and like the great daisy fuentes said , " we must all express our salsa gene ...
because it allows us to be ... as beautiful as we are .
muchas gracias .
thank you , miss mexico .
truly a voice of our generation .
ladies and gentlemen , it is my pleasure now to introduce to you ...
miss ...
puerto rico .
miss puerto rico !
hello .
fifi , what is it?
come here .
come here .
aw , they let you have a dog?
how nice .
nobody let's me do anything .
i'm not a maid .
not a maid .
you know , you just keep tellin'yourself that .
i wake up every morning and i say to myself in the mirror ...
i am a musician .
fifi , what is it baby?
come here .
would you stop fooling around with that dog?
the money .
the bag , it really was in the trunk .
i put fifi's toy inside , thinking it was my bag , but really it was the money bag .
it looks like my bag , but it was last year's .
the clasp is different .
sorry .
we don't have time for this .
let's get miss puerto rico , and rescue tomas .
oh , man ... how can three defenseless girls get away from you?
i dunno what happened .
they pushed me .
they kicked me .
what?
i don't know what happened !
victor , i'm not ready to die yet , i'm miserable .
and if we don't get that money , we're dead .
now look .
we ... we gotta find these broads .
okay .
okay , rodrigo .
don't yell at me .
i think they're at the don quixote puppet .
the don quixote puppet at the festival?
yeah .
i'll meet you there .
when women realize that we are the majority of this world ... the possibilities are endless , but it is up to us .
i believe that as women ...
check out the wonder bread .
excuse you .
come on .
in every aspect of our lives , right?
how would you respond to those who say a beauty contest such as this ... does more for the object ifiication of women , rather than women's rights?
i say , what better way to show that a woman can be both beautiful and intelligent?
in fact , if chosen , i plan to propose ... that all beauty contestants are required to take entrance exams .
absolutely !
what the hell is she talking about?
our goal , people , should be to celebrate the diverse ... and the wonderful qualities of today's latin woman .
we don't have time for this .
in fact , i believe ...
stop that imposter !
i am the real miss puerto rico .
i'm so sorry .
just a little misunderstanding ...
and that's my ...
that wasn't very dignified for a beauty queen .
anyway , what would tell me to go see tomas?
i can explain this whole thing .
we really don't have time for this .
what happened?
whoo !
what were you doing up there?
it was amazing , cici .
i really had them .
they were hanging on my every word .
girl , it wasn't words they were hangin 'on .
i learned from you .
lorena !
lorena !
hey , we found the money .
really?
let's go .
we have to get to that festival ... or we don't know what's going to happen to tomas .
i hope he's okay .
we have to find a puppet ...
i'm losing my mind .
welcome back .
where am i?
who are you?
agent carmen rivera , f. b. i.
f. b. i.?
i i it ... it's a federal crime to date three women?
no , but it should be .
i'm missing out on the whole contest .
you're a liar !
get over it !
yeah , focus , lorena .
got the map?
got it .
floor it !
what's happening?
buckle up , romeo .
we're going for a ride .
are you arresting me?
no , you're just the bait .
your girlfriends have something i want .
you know what?
i think we're gonna make it .
you know what?
for a lawyer , you make a hell of a beauty contestant .
you know what?
i don't know what got into me .
i never had that kind of attention before .
it was amazing !
i bet if the real miss puerto rico hadn't shown up , you would have won .
stop it .
you really think so?
definitely .
you think so?
you know what?
for a cocktail waitress , she's quite a mastermind .
street smart .
you , patty , you can really swing a lamp .
i know .
yeah .
yeah .
thank you .
thank you .
what was that?
i don't know .
what's happening?
we're running out of gas !
cici !
we're out of gas?
and they were all there at my house .
can you believe that?
well , you can't say you didn't have it coming .
nothing like this has ever happened before .
what?
getting caught?
no , falling in love with three women .
oh , love .
you call it love , hmm?
si , like neruda ...
i love in this way , because i don't know any other way of loving .
oh , my god .
you gotta be kidding me .
we're not gonna make it .
then we'll go to a gas station !
there's a gas station .
pull into the gas station .
i see the gas station !
this isn't full service .
this isn't full service .
are you out of your mind?
hurry !
hurry !
perfect !
we don't have time for this .
we need another ride .
are you with me?
ahead of you .
you know how to do it?
i don't know how to drive that thing .
you don't?
no !
what would i ...
i thought you did .
why would i know how to drive a motorcycle?
why would i?
'cause it seemed implied !
do you wanna argue , or do you wanna ride?
she doesn't know how to pump gas ... but she knows how to drive a motorcycle .
vamonos !
and she speaks spanish .
hold on , chicas !
sorry !
we have to save someone's lifie !
hey , wait !
that's my bike !
we promise to bring it back !
sad girls .
talkin ''bout bad girls .
maybe through my childhood .
i was raised by so many women .
mi madre , mis tias , and three other sisters .
that's interesting .
that's why the amount of women never seem to be a problem .
that's it .
that's it exactly !
you understand .
you are so smart .
know what you need?
you need to spend some time alone .
you shouldn't cover your beautiful eyes with such dark glasses .
sit back .
what?
you have beautifiul eyes .
i hope you girls know that stealing is illegal .
my mother's definitely gonna kill me this time .
we're gonna give it back , okay?
yeah .
yeah , but first we save tomas .
oh , look !
the hootchie mama's back .
she really wants tomas !
go !

there's the puppet !
let's go !
let's go !

enjoying the festival?
'scuse me , 'scuse me .
the cops !

i won't do it !
i don't dance !
listen to me .
this is the talent portion of the pageant .
convince the judges that you are the real miss puerto rico .

i don't care what's goin 'on .
i'm through messing around with these , uh , " machacas " .
machacas , man?
this is it .
you're gonna dance and you're gonna win that crown .
it's a tiara .
whatever .
i've had lessons , but i don't know that i'm ready for the stage .
in this case , less is more .
they can't stay up there forever .
yeah , you've obviously never been to a salsa club .
cici , those were expensive !
they look great .
are you sure about this?
yes .
we're safe here .
if we're on stage , they can't get us .
we're the dancers .

good call not grabbing the bag in miami , carmen .
those boys are gonna lead us right to whitaker .
and you to a promotion .
so , that guywas dating all three of them .
it's a long story .
hmm .
he turned out to be good bait .
i knew the perps would follow their money and the girls would follow their man .
i drove a harley , just like you taught me .
it was so cool .
i was miss puerto rico .
she was so beautiful !
i'm sorry .
i'm really sorry .
i never meant for this to happen .
i fell in love with all of you .
i don't think i could ever choose .
choose?
tomas , i have been out of control for , like , 36 hours now .
i've finally broken free of my parents .
i know what's best for me .
so fifi and i , we're gonna go it on our own now .
sorry .
ayayay , tomas .
what you did was very wrong .
but i 'm gonna thank you , because i've done things i've never dreamt of doing .
i realized that i don't need you to feel sexy ... and to have fun with my life , so if you're thinking of choosing me , mm mmm .
don't .
and you , cicita?
ay , papi .
suddenly it seems like i can do anything .
what i really wanna do is dance .
i think the world is ready for me now .
so i don't think i need you either .
i'm sorry .
good bye , baby !
tomas , it looks like they made the choice for you , huh?
yeah .
i'm taking your advice , carmen .
i'm going to spend some time alone .
good for you .
but before i do ... would you like to get some dinner?
dinner?
yes .
is that another one of your lines , tomas?
no more lines .
just food .
well , i am kinda hungry .
i'm starving .
can i drive?
i don't think so .
i'm going dancing more often .

cancerian ... oh , the moment of your life .
