thanks for nothing , permian .
go home , cowards .
i don't understand what's gonna happen at this point .
how do we [ sportscaster ]
another loss , and that's thrown us into a three way tie .
they're going to have a coin toss .
you gonna be all right?
i'm okay .
you're serious?
that's right .
we're gonna get the three coaches , they're all gonna toss a coin .
i love you .
what the hell kind of way is that to make a decision?
when you assemble the kind of talent that we have here , and then you just throw it away like that .
it started with him playin'boobie when we had a big lead .
and now this is a once in a lifetime thing to be able to see these people
i mean , we could have been in the history books .
and now?
ain't no way .
i mean , that's it .
what about winchell's play tonight?
well , what do you think?
and that billingsley couldn't hold on they all suck . !
that's what it is .
you know what else it is , too?
they been doin'too much learnin'in the schools .
my daddy used to take a bullwhip , and he'd cut it up [ sucks on lip ]
and he'd tie 13 knots in it .
then he'd beat me and beat me in my gut ... [ clears throat ]
till i got a sick feeling in my stomach .
well , that's how i feel ... when i watch you ... play ... football .
sick at my stomach .
oh , i need some fresh air !
aah . !
what the hell are you doing?
get this sickness out of my stomach .
yeah .
goddamn it , dad .
you were sent down here to learn how to play football .
and you haven't .
you have not !
and i gotta take that as a personal ... failure !
nobody in mojo football wants to win in a coin toss .
but that's the way it is .
that's the way the tiebreaker is .
well , they oughta change that .
they ought to change coaches make a lot of changes in executing .
i was supposed to make a man outta you .
shit .
you know what that is?
do you know what that is?
that's a state championship .
i won a state championship .
just calm down , dad .
can you touch that?
can you ... touch ... that?
can you ... touch ... that !
hell with it .
what the hell are you doing?
you drunk bastard !
you ever feel cursed , coach?
like , no matter what , inside your heart you feel that you're gonna lose .
like something's hanging over you , following you like a witch or a demon thatjust what is wrong with you?
why you gotta be so messed up?
you can't win .
i feel like that all the time .
even when things are going good .
when we're winnin ', it's there .
and when we're losin ', it's there .
what is wrong with you?
it took me a long time to realize that , uh ,
there ain't much difference between winnin 'and losin ', except for how the outside world treats you .
but inside you , it's about all the same .
it really is .
fact of the matter is , i believe that , uh , our only curses are the ones that are self imposed .
you know what i'm sayin '?
we , all of us , dig our own holes .
god , dad .
breaks somebody's back
what is wrong with you?
what's wrong with you?
ladies and gentlemen , this is truly unbelievable .
a three way tie for first place .
so , in less than an hour , this truck stop , which we're not allowed to reveal the identity of , [ camera clicking ] will serve as host for a coin toss ... that will send two of these teams to the state play offs ... and one of them home empty handed .
okay , skip .
we're on in three , two , one .
folks , we're here with the three winning coaches .
now , we've all agreed on the rules .
two out of three here , odd man out .
if you got one tails , they're out .
if you got one heads , they're out .
it's a tough way after a great season for these coaches , but this is the way it's gonna be .
when i give the word , we're gonna toss our coins .
and then the district's gonna have its two representatives .
let's see the coins , guys .
all right , uh , coach doug mccutcheon from abilene cooper's got
what is it , coach?
a 1922 silver dollar .
'22 silver dollar , all right .
coach gary gaines from permian , you got a
'69 nickel .
'69 nickel .
and from midland lee , coach earl miller's got a well , that's just your basic u. s. quarter .
okay .
coaches ready?
one .
ain't no curses .
two .
three .
toss 'em .
coins are down .
this one looks like it's heads .
okay , that's heads for abilene cooper .
that's mine .
it's heads .
okay .
midland lee is also heads .
hey , we got a third one over here , skip .
coach , that's you .
come on , gaines .
come on .
don't touch that .
just leave it alone .
well , that's heads .
yup .
that's heads too .
permian is also heads .
man .
yeah .
well , that figures .
the way you guys'teams played each other this year , it'd take more than one toss , so ...
hang on a second .
you know , this coin's pretty worn .
does this look like heads to you , doug?
i can't tell the difference .
it might be tails .
folks , there might be some controversy here regarding cooper's coin .
it's tails .
so , the good news is that life continues for both midland lee and permian high schools .
at least for another couple of weeks .
that's the good news .
the not so good news is that it looks like all roads are eventually leading to dallas carter .
and what a monster of a team dallas carter is .
this dallas carter team appears to be completely unstoppable .
i mean , the rumor is they've got nine players that have already signed division i letters of intent .
damn , them boys big .
they are a very , very good football team , people .
i'll get that car fixed today .
yeah .
i don't want this to sound like an apology , but , uh , i didn't mean half the things i said la i know .
you just [ chuckles ]
you ain't gettin 'it .
you don't understand .
this is the only thing you're ever gonna have .
forever , it carries you forever .
it's an ugly fact of life .
donnie , hell .
it's the only fact of life .
you got one year , one stinkin'year to make yourself some memories , son .
that's all .
it's gone after that .
and i'll be damned if you're not gonna miss it .
no guts .
what's up , water bug?
what's up , boobie?
water bug !
play offs belong to you , baby .
i'll make you proud .
what you all lookin 'at?
play your ass off ! .
win state .
be perfect , all that shit .
this is a gift for you .
it's gonna be worth a lot of money .
i bet it will .
you be perfect , preacher man .
what's up?
now what we gonna do?
i can't do nothin 'else but play football .
hey , hey .
don't worry about that .
don't worry about it?
i can't be doin 'nothin 'else .
you'll be all right , son .
i can't do nothin 'else but play football .
why?
we practiced and we practiced .
it'll be okay .
you told me we were gonna go to the pros .
what the hell am i gonna do without my knee?
you'll find somebody else .
don't worry about it , son .
no !
i wanted to buy you a house !
they won't let me play , though . !
it's play off time in texas . !
and who cares if permian snuck in on a coin toss?
you know there's been a lot of expectations for this permian football team .
and you gotta love this play off atmosphere . !
they call this the thinning of the herd , the survival of the fittest .
win, you go home .
lose, you play basketball .
quarterback mike winchell .
runs back , pulls right , throws long .
caught . !
touchdown . !
whoo !
the panthers defeated dallas jesuit to advance to round 16 .
they're goin'to the 20 , to the ten , to the five . !
it's comer , folks , into the end zone for another permian touchdown . !
chris comer with another sensational performance . !
permian cruises past san angelo and into the quarter
permian was afraid of that .
dallas carter
brian chavez , a great reading player touchdown . !
permian defeats nimitz 48 7 . !
moving into the semi finals of the texas 5 aplay offs .
advancing to the state finals .
mike winchell drops back , throws a 50 yard bomb . !
it's gonna be caught by parker . !
it's going out ofbounds .
what a good team [ man # 2 ]
and that's it .
permian's gonna battle dallas carter ... for the texas class 5 a state championship . !
what would it take for you to come up to texas stadium?
how about if y'all come out here?
where?
over at ratliff stadium?
yeah .
i still think there'd be a problem with our fans sittin 'with your fans .
i don't see any problems .
we can bring in extra police to handle the crowd control issues .
mr. mcclary , perhaps you're not aware , but we have an all black community .
and frankly , between our communities , there are some issues .
wait a minute .
what issues are we talkin 'about?
you know , i'm not gonna get into it at this table .
it's just different .
how about if we went with a neutral site?
somewhere like that?
or, you know what we could do , is the astrodome .
astrodome .
i got no problem with that .
good .
let's discuss officials .
i think the simplest thing to do is get a zebra crew ... outta some neutral place like san antonio , or somethin '.
now are these zebras gonna be white or black?
well , as far as i know , zebras are white and black .
what are we talkin 'about here?
how many black stripes these zebras got?
i believe a zebra's got about the same amount ofblack ones as he does white ones .
how many black stripes you think a zebra's got?
it makes sense to hire a crew as is .
that's how we always do it .
don't make sense to me .
it makes sense to me .
not me .
well , not a whole lot does make sense to you .
yeah , there's a lot that makes sense to me .
so you think having an all black officiating crew is gonna somehow help you win the game?
watch your mouth .
hey , coach .
how you doin '?
hey .
ben , how you doin '?
all right , coach .
you?
oh , pretty good .
hi , sharon .
how you doin '?
we're just out gettin 'flowers for the ladies .
secretaries week .
oh , is that right?
i'll be dogged .
well , see , i don't have a secretary .
so i don't have to worry .
you win state , coach , we'll get you two secretaries .
everything all right?
well , yeah .
everybody's gonna be just fine .
everything's all right , as long as we get out there and get what we need to get done ... and , uh, you know , win state .
boy , i sure hope so .
yeah , me too .
yeah , i want it bad as y'all do , believe me .
yes , sir .
'course , you know , dallas carter .
that's a that's a tough team .
real tough team .
yeah?
well .
we're a pretty tough team too , coach .
yeah , that's true .
so , uh , beat 'em .
or what?
or what?
or [ sighs ]
you know , that'd be a real bad deal for you , gary , so
all right?
let's just get out there and get it done .
get that state championship .
well , i sure appreciate your support .
we believe in you .
i'm glad you do .
we're behind you , coach .
see you , sharon .
well , that was subtle .
yup .
are we gonna move again?
no , baby .
it's possible .
no .
what do you think about alaska?
what about alaska?
well , you know ,
i bet that they are not nearly as serious about their football in alaska .
i think that's a real nice idea .
we should go to alaska .
stay there for a couple years 20 .
okay .
just somethin 'to think about , baby .
mm hmm .
i think it'd be really nice .
build us a nice little igloo .
baby , these boys are big .
yeah , they are .
sure are .
you get any sleep last night?
oh , yes , sir .
i did .
i did .
good .
we got a six hour ride , so you can get you some more .
all right , coach .
coach .
coach .
you got room for one more?
absolutely .
hop on .
mojo has come to houston .
this is the astrodome , the eighth wonder of the world , and today ... it's gonna be odessa permian versus dallas carter .
this is a moment these kids have been looking for their whole life .
they started playing as eight year olds in the pop warner fields of odessa , or in dallas .
they've dreamed of the state championship laying in bed late at night , dreaming of their chance to bring home the title , for their town , for their team , for their school .
folks, you better lock the doors , turn up the radios , strap yourself in .
we've got east texas versus west texas .
we've got texas high school football at its finest .
no doubt .
this crowd is jacked . !
this is gonna be an all out war . !

and whitaker will find grande and pass as chavez is leveled .
and grande will take this one to the half from more than 50 yards away in play .
there's not a panther within ten yards ofhim .
that's a carter cowboy touchdown .
carter will go for two .
they will not kick .
no surprise .
this team has not kicked an extra point or a field goal all year .
whitaker now will make his play .
going left will get the two point conversion .
cowboys , ten .

yes , sir .
are you gonna let the offense do everything , or are you gonna help us out some?
i'm gonna help us .
you gonna help us out some?
okay .
you gonna have to keep them out of the end zone 'cause if they score more than we do , we lose the game , 'kay?
right .
all right?
so wake up . !
it's been all carter here in the first quarter .
carter over 161 yards already , and panthers minus 21 .
winchell is trying
comer stopped at the line again . !
great grandma's drawers !
i can't believe that !
winchell's downed again . !
right now i don't know if we need to worry so much about the scores , just whether or not we'll be able to take all these boys home .
permian's offensive line is being
what in the world are you doing?
did you see that?
did you see that?
back up , coach .
he almost killed him !
clay , this game is quickly spiraling out of control .
at some point you worry about the safety of the kids .
tell you what .
the panthers came into this ball game really fired up .
right now they've got the wind just knocked out of'em .
you've got to get your head in the game .
are you in the game?
yes , sir .
you have to wake up out there !
yes , sir !
five minutes left to play in a half that's been all carter .
they lead 18 nothing .

let's go !
mccleery's comin'on the zone blitz .
robert whitaker will look to throw .
looking right .
ball is in the air .
and it's picked offby  [ crowd roars ]
and i'm pretty sure the preacher man is headed for the promised land .
he may take this one all the way . !
he clears yeah !
finally a spark oflife in the form of ivory christian . !
whitaker has taken him down . !
inside the mojo's 5 . !
we've got plenty of time to get in this game .
y'all need to wake up out there and play football , okay?
you need to find each other .
'cause you need each other right now , so find each other .
go field goal .
let's get on the board .
elephant 37 .
count it on one .
ready .
break !
jump on the ball !
left to winchell , drops back , rolls right .
he's gonna run it inside the five . !
winchell throws this play towards the end zone .
anthony has him , but mike winchell ... will stretch himself into the end zone for the mojo touchdown . !
winchell strives for the goal line .
holds the ball out over the plane .
yes !
he didn't break the plane !
coach , we've got him
hey , ref ! .
did you see that?
what?
there's no way he got in .
he got in .
how you gonna coach james !
winchell's without a helmet . !
kicked in his face . !
there's not a flag anywhere on the field !
how can you miss that , ref?
time has run out in the first half .
coach gary gaines and his mojo cats trail carter by 26 7 .
what in the hell happened on that  that's right , green .
you understand that?
forty yards?
hell no !
you're just steppin 'aside and lettin ''em walk in
pop , pop , pop !
that's what i want !
all of you around that ball !
to go for two and get it every single time?
that is ridiculous .
do you realize they have not even kicked a field goal yet?
just relax .
we not tryin 'to coach y'all now .
coach done gave y'all all these adjustments , okay?
if you do everything the coach told you to do two point conversions ,
i want those gone .
here is what we're gonna do .
we're gonna use our speed .
we're gonna run texas power
what's wrong with y'all?
y'all are playin 'like some little girls !
y'all act like you never played football before !
these guys are nothin '!
you hear me?
they bleed just like we do .
yes , sir !
and sweat just like we do .
do you hear me?
they went through two a days .
we went through two a days in 110 degree heat !
yes , sir !
i want you to hit everything that move !
if the ref gets in your way , you hit him !
okay , then .
let's play !
they're cheatin 'us too !
they're against us too .
this is our team .
this is us !
let's go right now !
let's get it off now and let's go !
permian is gonna have to step up here and establish some offensive confidence .
let's go .
well , it's real simple .
you got two more quarters and that's it .
now most of you have been playing this game for ten years .
you got two more quarters and after that most of you will never play this game again as long as you live .
you all have known me for a while ... and for a long time now, you've been hearing me talk about being perfect .
well , i want you to understand somethin '.
to me , being perfect ... is not about that scoreboard out there .
it's not about winning .
it's about you and your relationship to yourself and your family and your friends .
bein'perfect ... is about being able to look your friends in the eye ... and know that you didn't let them down .
because you told 'em the truth .
and that truth is , is that you did everything that you could .
there wasn't one more thing that you could've done .
can you live in that moment ... as best you can with clear eyes ... and love in your heart?
with joy in your heart?
if you can do that , gentlemen , then you're perfect .
i want you to take a moment ... and i want you to look each other in the eyes .
i want you to put each other in your hearts forever .
because forever's about to happen here in just a few minutes .
i want you to close your eyes ...
and i want you to think about boobie miles , who is your brother .
and he would die to be out there on that field with you tonight .
and i want you to put that in your hearts .
boys , my heart is full .
my heart's full .
ivory .
our father ... [ all in unison ]
who art in heaven , hallowed be thy name .
thy kingdom come , thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven .
give us this day our daily bread ... and forgive us our trespasses .
as we forgive those who trespass against us .
lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil .
for thine is the kingdom  the power and the glory forever .
amen !
that's it , baby !
hut . !
let go offense !
lead and roll .
spread right eagle .
are you hungry?
thank you .
they're killin 'us with their size .
they're playing some hard hitting football . !
whoo !
get off the ball !
drive hard !
sit !
we will not be able to live , do you realize that?
let the boy play .
get your guys back .
golly bum !
z " up 543 .
get to the first landmark or i'm gonna hit you as soon as you get there .
on one , ready .
break !
get hell into the snap !
show me somethin '!
whoo !
did you see that?
that's the way to play ball .
you know that was a bad call !
now if he backs up on the next series , it'll be over .
he can't drop back fast enough , all right?
yeah , it's good .
after the blowout of the first half , we've seen a showcase of defense here in the third quarter .
the score closing with carter on top , 26 14 .
10 : 25 remains in the fourth quarter .
it's third and ten for carter as whitaker is pinned and hit drake for six .
tackled by thomas .
it's gonna be fourth down .
you know carter's going for it on fourth .
unbelievable . ! james is not even gonna consider a punt . !
so now whitaker on fourth down as carter will go for it .
he's gonna look for graf .
graf's the main receiver , and this one bounces off the turf .
oh , incomplete .
no way .
got that touchdown .
look , did you see it?
i'm gonna talk to him .
well , i wanna talk to whoever did see it !
i wanna talk to whoever did see it !
this is big , man .
anybody get a better look?
gary?
did you turn?
jason?
i turned and looked , but i was lost .
that ain't no catch .
i couldn't see it .
are you sure he caught that football?
his was a catch , ref .
lee , mack , set 'em up .
we got first down .
what are you talkin 'about?
that was a bad call !
this man has it .
this man had the catch .
there's no way .
the ball came off the turf .
that is bullshit !
here's the pass .
whitaker has found graf .
graf makes a one handed phenomenal catch for another carter t. d.
chavez in frustration levels him in the end zone .
personal foul on the defense .
and that's gonna cost permian 15 on the kickoff .
called on the carter two point conversion .
they now lead 34 14 .
these panthers are gettin'beat physically .
they're gettin'beat mentally .
they're really down .
we've seen games like this before , but permian's always been on the other end .
all right?
we're lookin 'for the next play .
comer got across the five .
comer , to the 30 , to the 35 .
comer could go all the way , folks .
comer , 25 , 20 , 15 , 10 , 5 . !
that's a mojo touchdown . !
chris comer has brought permian back one more time . !
we're in this ball game now .
we're in this ball game .
5 : 27 to play .
carter still leads 34 21 .
come on , chavo !
they will pitch it to grande .
ripped away by chavez . !
let's go !
yeah !
come on !
now strong right , 81 trojan horse .
all right .
here we go , fellas .
let's shock these punks .
strong right , 81 trojan horse .
me and you , baby .
we got it .
throw it deep .
on one , ready .
mike winchell to don billingsley will go right .
they're on the run , but stop , wait .
instead he's looking for a receiver .
winchell's open . !
winchell's open in the end zone .
winchell make a tremendous catch . !
winchell , with a touchdown reception , scores the mojo touchdown . !
whoo !
yeah !
one more , one more .
but is it too little , too late for coach gary gaines?
mojo defense is really gonna have to step it up if they have a prayer of winning the state championship .
grande , across midfield .
dropped at the 40 .
first down !
let's go , baby !
the clock now has to be a concern for coach gary gaines and the permian staff .
we need to stop right now .
first and ten now for carter from the permian 30 .
less than two minutes to play .
one more carter first down , folks , and that will be it .
grande hit . !
yeah , baby !
they do know how to tackle .
all right !
what's my edge?
what's my edge?
second down and long .
promptly falls back .
just keep rollin 'it , baby .
come on !
the clock continues to roll .
this will set up third down .
permian desperately needs a stop to get the ball back .
grande right up the gun over chavez . !
maybejust doing what he needs for a first down .
first down here , and the game's over .
it didn't make it .
it's short .
short . !
by inches . !
okay .
mm hmm .
james immediately signals he's goin'for it .
james is gonna gamble .
he can get these four inches and win the state championship , right here , right now .
okay , here's what we're gonna do .
we're gonna do a texas stunt .
now , ivory , you and steen , i want you to twist .
yes , sir .
steen , you go first .
yo , coach .
ivory, you come offhis butt into the " a '" gap .

hey !
seagull, you fly across the horizon
into the misty morning sun
nobody asks you where you are goin '
nobody knows where you're from
there is a man asking the question
is this really the end of the world
seagull you must have known for a long time
the shape of things to come
now you fly through the sky
never asking why
and you fly all around
till somebody
shoots you down
mmm, yeah
seagull, you fly
seagull, you fly
and you fly away today
and you fly away tomorrow
and you fly away
leave me to my sorrow [ humming ]
