i need this , leon .
i need time to get my head together .
yeah , and i need ...
a drink .
don't move .
i'll go get one .
when you told me to get this baby out foryou ...
i thought my hearin 'was goin '.
i says to myself , " leon's a pro .
nobody uses that except beginners .
i like to stay in shape .
sure .
always stay on top ofit .
it's like me .
i gotta know where everything is all the time .
i never leave this place , except to go from here to there .
change ain't good , leon .
you know?
check it .
make sure it's the right thing .
i trustyou .
one thing's got nothin 'to do with the other .
remember that .
i will .
the rifle is the first weapon you learn how to use ... because it lets you keepyour distance from the client .
the closeryou get to being a pro ... the closeryou can get to the client .
the knife , for example , is the last thing you learn .
position .
never take it offuntil the last minute .
it reflects light .
they can seeyou coming from a mile away .
and always dress down .
never brighter than the floor , okay?
let's practice now .
it's the best way to learn .
who should i hit?
whoever .
i'll be with you in a second .
give me a few minutes .
thankyou .
you guys get lost .
i don't want to seeyou .
is everyone in position?
this has to look natural .
no women , no kids .
right?
right .
jogger in theyellow and orange?
keep calm .
don't takeyour eyes offhim .
breathe easy .
watch his movement .
pretend you're running with him .
try to feel his next movement .
take a deep breath .
hold it .
now .
oh , my god !
i'm all right .
i'm fine .
get down !
where'd that come from?
one shot .
not bad , huh?
who the hell fired?
i just can't breathe !
get offme .
can we try with real bullets now?
not today .
let's pack up .
like that .
no , thanks .
no discussion .
it seemed ... to socrates
i'll do it .
leon , all we do is work .
we need a break .
let's play a game .
what kind ofgame?

you should be watering me ifyou want me to grow .
you're right .
wait !
they gotta bejumping out ofthe plate .
they gotta be alive .
it's been a long time , leon .
i missed you .
and you missed some nicejobs too .

training's good , but don't overdo it .
training don't pay as good as working , leon .
tony ... all the money i make , thatyou keep for me
you need some money?
just curious .
i've been working a long time ... and i haven't done anything with my money .
i thought maybe someday i could use it .
you met a woman .
you gotta be careful with women .
rememberwhen you arrived in this country?
when i tookyou in , you were still wet behind the fuckin 'ears ... and , already , you were in deep shit because ofa woman .
don't forget that , leon .
i wish i could sometimes .
you know , about my money
maybe i could give ... a little ... to someone .
you know , to help out .
it's your money .
i'm just holding it foryou , like a bank .
except better than a bank because banks always get knocked off .
no one knocks offold tony .
besides , with a bank ... there's always tons offorms and all that shit .
but old tony , nothin 'to read , nothin 'to write .
it's all in his head .
i know how to read now .
that's good , leon .
your money's here .
wheneveryou want it , youjust ask me .
here's a grand .
come on .
it's okay .
i don't need it .

you can'tjust speak to any guy offthe street .
leon , get a grip .
what's the big fucking deal?
i wasjust smoking a butt while i was waiting .
i wantyou to stop cursing .
you can't talk to people like that all the time .
i wantyou to make an effort to talk nice .
and i wantyou to stop smoking .
it will kill you .
stay away from him .
he looks like a weirdo .
i'll be out in five minutes .
stand where i can seeyou .
leon , i think i'm kinda falling in love with you .
it's the first time for me , you know .
how doyou know it's love ifyou've never been in love before?
'cause i feel it .
where?
in my stomach .
it's all warm .
i always had a knot there , and now it's gone .
mathilda , i'm glad you don't have a stomachache anymore .
i don't think it means anything .
i'm late forwork .
i hate being late forwork .
how's the practicing going?
how are we today , miss?
a little sick ofpracticing .
i understand .
butyou're doing all right .

nothing's free .
like a parking meter .
when you stop , you pay .
it's the law .
only on t. v. what'd you say?
forget it .
how much is your meter?
ten dollars ... a month .

i do business for myself .
so this is something ... personal , is it?
what filthy piece ofshit ... did i do now?
you killed my brother .
i'm sorry .
and you wannajoin him?
it's always the same thing .
it's when you start to become really afraid ofdeath ... thatyou learn to appreciate life .
doyou like life , sweetheart?
that's good .
because i take no pleasure ... in taking a life ... ifit's from a person who doesn't care about it .
stan , i've been looking all over foryou .

is that whatyou call " i won't be long "?
i been here for ten minutes .
i did my best .
doyou like it?
yes .
so say it .
i like it .
not thirsty?
you know , a girl's first time is very important .
it determines the rest ofher life sexually .
i read that once in one ofmy sister's magazines .
my girlfriends told me they hated their first experience .
that's because they didn't love the guys .
theyjust did it to show off .
afterwards , they started liking it , like cigarettes .
will i like it the first time?
mathilda , no .
why not?
i just can't .
you love someone else?
no .
i mean
there was someone a long time ago .
before i came to the states .
her father didn't want her to see me .
she was from a very respectable family .
mine was ... you know ... not so respectable .
her dad went nuts every time she'd take offto see me .
she still snuck off to seeyou , right?
right .
see , nothing can stop love , leon .
he killed her .
one shot through the head .
they kept him injail for two days , and they let him go free .
they said it was an accident .
so ... one night i ... waited for him .
five hundred feet with a lens .
he also had an accident .
the same night i took a boat and came here ... to meet up with my father who was working fortony .
i was 1 9 .
since then i've never left the city , and ...
i've never had another girlfriend .
you see , mathilda ...
i wouldn't be a good lover .
okay .
would you do me one favor?
what?
i'm sick ofwatching you sleep on your chair .
we're gonna share the bed .
i don't think it's a good idea .
it's okay .
putyour legs up on the bed .
yeah .
that's nice .
putyour head down .
it's okay .
relax .
good night , leon .
good night .
i want a piece ofcake first !
manolo , take the kids in the kitchen .
i have a lot ofrespect foryour business , tony .
when you've killed for us in the past ... we've always been satisfied .
that's exactlywhy today is going to be very hard for me .
i hopeyou'll excuse my mood .
my man was killed right here on your turf .
the chinks tell me that the hit man ... was kind ofthe italian type .
so we figured that tony might know something .
wait .
there's more .
you're gonna love this .
a few hours later , a little 1 2 year old girl comes into my office ... armed to the teeth , with the firm intention ofsending me to the morgue .
doyou know who came and got her right there in my building?
the very same ...
italian hit man .
i'm dying to meet him .
relax .
everything's fine .
sleep well?
i never really sleep .
got one eye open always .
yeah , i forgot .
i never saw someone with one eye open snore so much .
i snore?
like a baby .
i'm gonna get some milk for breakfast .
i won't be long .
don't forget the code when you come back .
two knocks , then one , and two knocks again .
right?
right .
ring these up .
i'm gonna go get some milk .
from here on out , you don't make a sound .
you answer my questions by nodding yes or shaking your head no .
is he alone?

mathilda .

leon asked me to helpyou out ... ifsomethin 'happened , and i think somethin 'happened .
he put aside a little cash foryou .
so what i'm suggesting is that ... seein 'as how you're still soyoung ...
i should hold the money foryou until you're older .
like a bank , you know , except ... it's better than a bank 'cause banks always get knocked off .
no one knocks offold tony .
but it's your money .
in the meantime ... all you gotta do is come here every once in awhile ... and i'll dish it out soyou can have a little fun .
here .
here's a hundred bucks to start .
can't i get ajob instead?
ajob?
what the hell can you do?
i can clean .
i ain't got no work for a 1 2 year old kid ... so get it out ofyour goddamn head !
it's over !
the game's over !
leon's dead !
you hear me?
come on .
you think i ain't hurtin 'too?
but he's dead .
you're gonna forget all this craziness and getyour little ass back to school .
now take this money and get the hell outta here .
don't let me seeyour face till next month ...
'cause something tells me i'm about to lose my famous kind streak .
my parents ... died ... in a car accident fourweeks ago .
it was terrible .
we didn't have the time to get to know one anotherwhen you first came here ... but i wantyou to know i'm not the kind ofwoman who'd let down a child ... whatever her situation , whatever her mistake .
so i'm going to helpyou and do my best to welcomeyou here again .
you have to stop lying to me , mathilda .
i wantyou to take a chance ... and trust me .
tell me what happened toyou .
my family got shot down by d. e. a. officers ... because ofa drug problem .
i left with the greatest guy on earth .
he was a hit man , the best in town , but he died this morning .
ifyou don't help me , i'll be dead by tonight .
you know her?
i've never seen her .
i thinkwe'll be okay here .
