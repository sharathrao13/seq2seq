previously on criminal minds ... anyone recognize these faces?
victims of the footpath killer .
that's what virginia newspapers are calling him .
we refer to him as the " unknown subject " or " unsub .
i told virginia p. d. , they're lookg for a white male in his 20s who owns an american made truck , works a menial job .
i told 'em when you find him , don't be surprised to hear him speak with a severe stutter .
have a n n n ... a n n nice day .
the gun .
t t ... take out the gun .
th ... th ... throw it .
any particular direction?
who ... who are y y y ... who are you?
who are you? !
fbi .
t t t ... t t ... take out your w ... your w wallet .
wh wh ... wh ... wh wh what ... what do you kn kn ... what do you know?
about you? or about the people who you've murdered?
i know a lot about you .
i know how you do it .
i know you can't stop .
and i know something that no one's ever been able to tell you .
i know why you stutter .
weren't you a little bit worried he might just shoot you?
i was a lot worried .
but how did you find him?
i was just stopping for gas .
i walked into that store , and i saw pieces of a profile that i'd given to virginia p. d. almost a year ago .
truck in disrepair , a disheveled young man, severe stutter .
james reese once said , " there are certain clues at a crime scene which , by their very nature , do not lend themselves " to being collected or examined .
how does one collect love , rage , hatred , fear?
these are things that we're trained to look for .
so anyone else would have just seen a guy who stutters , but you saw the footpath killer .
right . but sometimes these guys are still found by just dumb luck .
berkowitz was caught beuse of a parking ticket .
except the cop who caught him wasn't staring down a shotgun like you were .
this is true .
this is also a good time to stop .
thank you , sir .
thank you .
ok , i'm curious .
why'd he stutter?
you're on your way to becoming part of the behavior analysis team now , elle . you tell me .
check .
checkmate 3 moves .
what ... you know you'll beat him when you start learning .
learning what?
to think outside the box .
question for you .
shoot .
the footpath killer , why did he stutter?
come on , elle , we've all asked him , and he won't say .
he wants us to figure it out .
ok .
i'm up for a challeng good, because these go to you .
special agent jennifer jareau , jj if you like .
elle .
greenaway highest number of solved cases in seattle 3 years running , specialty in sex offender cases .
not bad .
well , i'm the unit liaison .
my specialty is untangling bureaucratic knots .
you'll probably be talking to me a lot .
my door's always open , mostly because i'm never in my office , so just call me on my cell , ok? we'll talk .
did you watch it?
yeah .
think everybody should see it .
bau team , can you meet me in the conference room , please?
i need to show you something .
this is from the phoenix office , bradshaw college in tempe , 6 fires in 7 months .
who recorded it?
a student with a digital camcorder .
he was watching a fire in the building across from their dorm .
the other person you'll see is his roommate , 20 year old matthew rowland .
this is crazy .
hey , mac , get over here .
you gotta see this .
the building's on fire .
bro , you getting this?
is that the kid?
yeah , that's him .
relax , man .
there's always fires during rush week .
yeah , but that's pretty big .
what building is that?
dude , over here .
check this out .
what is it?
i don't know , but it's coming underneath the door .
is someone in the hallway?
hey , someone's trying to get in .
hey , man , you should get in there .
oh , my god !
it smells like gas .
oh , god !
god !
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
aah !
put me out !
oh , my god !
oh , god !
help !
einstein once said : " imagination is more important than knowledge .
knowledge is limited .
imagination encircles the world .
there are 2 common stressors for a serial arsonist .
loss of job , loss of love .
when was the first fire set?
march .
uh , the next one was in may , anthe third one wasn't till september , then 2 weeks later there were 3 in one night .
he's speeding up .
fire's are closer together .
hey , reid , you got a statistic on arsonists?
82 % are white males between 17 and 27 .
female arsonists are far less likely , their motive typically being revenge .
sounds like our boy's a student .
don't be so sure .
you rely too much on precedent , you never allow for the unexpected .
if he went from setting one fire to 3 in 2 weeks 'time ... rapid escalation .
he's gone from the power to damage a building to something far more satisfying .
the power over life and death .
who we talking to first?
dean of students , ellen turner .
no badges .
i don't want to satisfy the unsub's need for attention by letting him know he got the fbi here .
try not to look official .
try to look less official .
obviously, i'd rather be meeting you under different circumstances .
this is fire inspector zhang .
this morning the chemistry department reported several bottles of highly flammable chemicals missing .
i'm prepared to evacuate this campus .
thank you .
that brings with it its own problems .
you might evacuate the arsonist as well .
then the case goes unsolved , the campus is reopened , but the fires start up again .
hotch , gideon , hold on a second .
you said the chemicals were missing today .
it says here that one of the previous fires was set with diesel fuel that disappeared from the grounds keeping facility .
how long after it disappeared was the fire set?
one day .
if he's holding to a pattern ...
who's to say the next fire won't be today?
door was locked .
matthew rowland and his roommate watched as the doorknob turned against the lock .
but the unsub couldn't get in .
so he pours the accelerant into the room from the hallway .
which means he couldn't see the fire .
but he could hear matthew rowland screaming .
yeah , but not for long .
he would have left quickly .
yeah , to avoid being spotted .
it doesn't make sense .
pyromania as a mental disorder may just be a simple myth , but we do know from precedent that serial arsonists derive pleasure from pathological fire setting .
sex and power .
but a serial arsonist wouldn't just set a fire and walk away .
he needs to experience it .
so why would he set a fire he couldn't watch?
he turned the water off just before the fire .
the last 3 were set with these .
2 devices , simultaneous ignition .
there was no device used on matthew rowland .
unsub set that one manually?
he wanted to be there to enjoy the kid's death .
not necessarily .
well , if the target was matthew rowland , then why set the other 2 fires?
the motives for arson are relatively simple .
there's ndalism , crime concealment , political statement ...
profit and revenge .
we terviewed matthew rowland's roommate .
he said matthew was very well liked .
no reason for revenge . what about vandalism?
no .
the fires are too sophisticated , and if he's trying to make a political statement , he's not being too clear about it .
there's an underlying strategy in this case .
matthew , firefighters , injured victims .
to the unsub , they're not people .
they're ...
they're objects .
more like , uh ... chess pieces .
exactly .
all right ...
i want to set a dormitory fire .
where would i start?
in the basement . the upper levels would be fuel .
then why did i start on the third floor?
oh , god !
because it wasn't the building i wanted to set on fire .
the timer sets the road flare , which then lights the chemical mixture inside the canister .
simple .
yet sophisticated in its simplicity .
i mean , there's a meticulous construction to it .
chemical accelerant could mean chemistry student .
could also mean chemistry professor .
mmm , i say student . you need self confidence to
lecture in front of a classroom full of 30 college kids .
arsonists are socially incompetent .
this guy doesn't go on dates .
he doesn't go to parties .
he dsn't feel comfortable in front of groups .
and , of course , he's a total psychopath .
course .
you think we'll get a lead from the hotline?
no .
if you don't mind my askg , why then did you set up the number?
well , serial arsonists enjoy manipulating authorities .
they like to communicate , explain themselves .
i'm not waiting to hear from a tipster or witness .
you're waiting to hear from him .
yeah .
all right , office hours . i have my own homework to do .
thank you , professor wallace .
no problem .
we don't want a stampede on our hands because the exits out of the campus block so quickly .
now , we have staging areas , and we must utilize every possible ... agent gideon?
agent gideon .
agent gideon?
everybody out of the building !
go !
what is it?
look out ! clear the whole building !
clear it !
now !
aah !
come on !
help me !
help me !
get off of me !
there was a teacher !
let it go !
he's already dead .
let it go .
he might be here watching .
yeah .
take pictures as many as you can .
you got it .
the professor's name was wallace?
it's a terrible loss .
he was one of those teachers .
um ... he knew how to make a difference .
gideon , we've got police and security interviewing everyone in that building .
how long will it tak to finish evacuating the campus?
this is a college of 10, 000 students and faculty .
well , there's another problem with evacuating .
you mean , we might accelerate the unsub's timeline .
let's round everybody up .
dean turner?
hi , i'm jeremy .
i'm one of the research assistants at the science department .
we were talking , and , uh , we'd like to help .
the best thing you can do right now is just stay we know how he did it .
we've been at this all night , and we've got nothin '.
look at these expressions .
we got fear , a touch of horror , even a little bit of panic .
where's the guy gettin 'off?
when asked about his moves , peter dinsdale said ,
i am devoted to fire .
fire is my master .
ok , so who was our boy's master?
10, 000 plus students ...
and one has a serious fascination with fire .
fire starting is one third of the homicidal triad ... an early predictor of adult disassociative criminal behavior .
if we looked in his childhood , we'd probably find all three .
bedwetting ... and cruelty to animals .
absent or abusive father , trouble with the opposite sex , chronic low self esteem m. o. would be dynamic .
evolvings, fire setting escalates , they thrive on panic , fear .
it's just the standard profile of a serial arsonist .
based on hundreds of interviews .
based on precedent .
everything the unsub should be , according to research .
we're off the mark .
because of the 2 missing elements .
sex and power the 2 motives that drive a serial arsonist .
and without 'em , we do not have a profile .
whoa !
hey !
uh , sorry .
i didn't mean to scare you .
i'm just , um , i'm campus patrol .
i'm supposed to ask for your i. d.
sure , sure .
you're one of those fbi guys .
um , like a profiler , right?
like , one look at a crime scene , you can tell what kind of shampoo a killer uses?
you sound skeptical .
uh , maybe a little .
your girlfriend thinks you're gonna break up with her .
you're kidding , right?
well , you keep adjusting your necklace .
that tells me you're not used to wearing one or somebody else probably bought it for you , bought it recently , and the chinese symbol on it means " forever yours .
take care of yourself , all right?
reid .
since you're more their age , why don't you do the talking?
ahem .
hi hi , guys . uh , my name's , uh , dr .
spencer reid .
i'm a , uh , agent with the the bau , the behavioral analysis unit of the fbi , which , um , it used to be called the bsu , the behavioral science unit , but not anymore .
they changed it to the bau .
um , it's part of the ncabc , the national center for the analysis of violent crime which is also part of this thing called the cirg , the critical incident response group, and what he's trying to say is we'd love to know how you can help us .
may i , please? thank you .
see this?
drill a hole in the side , fill it with gasoline or whatever's good and flammable .
turn the light on .
boom .
that is what went down , didn't it?
the stuff's all over the net .
wanna know how to make a molotov cocktail that sets itself on fire?
potassium , sulfur ... and normal sugar .
sugar sugar , which is not exactly plutonium .
you could get this stuff anywhere .
sugar from the supermarket .
but you don't need to be a chem major to know that .
do you think it's a chem student?
you wanna know what i think?
i think ... it would be a good time to take the semester off .
hold on .
you need a key to get it movin 'after 10 : 00 p. m.
so what are you still doin 'here?
you know hot to solve the 3 body problem?
computing the mutual gravitational interaction between the earth , sun and moon?
do you have any idea how many people called me today with absolute certainty that our arsonist is a firefighter?
like , yeah , i saw backdraft .
uh , let me call you right back .
this came into the hotline about 5 minutes ago .
you've reached the fbi tip hotline for the bradshaw college fires .
karen .
i do this for karen .
karen .
i do this for karen .
play it again .
the call came from the office right next to wallace's 5 minutes before the fire was started .
play it again .
karen . i do this for karen .
again , louder .
karen .
i do this for karen .
what is it?
i'm not sure .
somethin 'about it .
is this tape clean?
i can put it through some audio filters .
look , we need as close to the real voe as you can get , and anything that might be in the background . can you do it?
ok , you know how on star trek when captain kirk asks mccoy to do something totally impossible , and mccoy says , " damn it , jim , i'm a doctor , not a miracle worker?
hey , what are you tellin 'me , not to expect a miracle?
no , i'm saying i'm not a doctor .
that's my girl .
these are all thwomen on campus with the first name karen .
a lot of karens .
hmm .
what if the unsub is one of the students leaving?
no , he's not done yet .
he's not goin 'anywhere .
keep thinkin '.
you mean , out outside the box?
that's what morgan's ways telling me .
he says that's why i can never beat you at chess .
well , he's probably right .
but , i mean , in this situation, what exactly is the box?
the standard profile of a serial arsonist .
if everything you know goes in the box , what's left?
what you don't know .
the unknown .
sometimes you have to get creative .
even if you think it's utterly unlikely , you have to think of things nobody else thought of .
like a stutter .
yeah , exactly .
thank you , karen .
karen number 7 .
you know, there's gotta be a faster way to do this .
how 'bout we just change the first question to
have you recently dated a homicidal pyromaniac?
speaking of questions , you figured out yet why the footpath killer stuttered?
nope .
you?
i know that embarrassment makes a stutter worse , and that when you're flustered , it's more difficult to control the articulatory musculature of the face .
you sound like reid .
you did not just say that .
obviously , somebody's been doin 'their homework .
i still have no idea what causes a stutter .
karen .
number 8 .
hey .
i didn't scare you again , did i?
um , sorry . this is one of the buildings on my patrol .
just lookin 'at the board .
the 3 body problem .
you know what it means?
uh , no .
no idea .
it's physics .
it's one of the great mathematical mysteries .
you broke up with her .
no more necklace .
yeah , i kinda wanna date someone else .
what's her name?
brian .
oh .
well , that's , uh ... that's a pretty good reason .
did she take it all right?
yeah .
yeah , other than telling me that homosexuality's a sin , and that i'm going to incur the wrath of god .
ha .
the wrath of god .
ok , gorgeous, i've put this thing through every audio filter i've got . there's only one thing i can tell you for sure .
this guy isn't saying " karen . " it's more like " ka rown .
garcia , what the hell is ka rown?
if i figure it out , does it earn me a night of passionate lovemaking?
most definitely , sweetness ... with reid .
oh .
bye .
hey , reid .. garcia says it's not " karen .
it's actually somethin 'more like charown .
charown?
charown .
i do it because of charown .
that's hebrew .
it's god's word in anger .
yeah .
the motive is now religious?
well , you know , in a lot of religions , god is related to fire .
well , brahman is fire in hinduism , and the jews see god as a pillar of fire , and christians worship god as a consuming fire .
ok , so we're lookin 'for a theology major .
maybe he's punishing the other students for their sins .
i don't want this .
what what's the most sinful place on campus?
come on , elle .
when i was in college , that was everywhere .
a fraternity?
a campus bar?
no , 'cause th's not consistent with the previous targets .
what about the idea of baptism by fire?
aren't we all supposed toe tested through fire in revelations?
look , it's good , it's good , but let's please do not jump to conclusions .
religion might be a part of it , but it's not necessarily the prime compulsion .
gideon , rush to conclusions , jump to conclusions .
who cares?
we are running out of time .
compulsion .
this is azy .
hey , mac , get over here .
you gotta see this .
the building's on fire .
bro , you getting this?
get out of the way ! we should call campus security
relax , man . there's always fires during rush week .
yeah , but that's pretty big .
what building is that?
dude , over here .
check this out .
what is it?
i don't know , but it's coming underneath the door .
is someone in the hallway?
hey , someone's trying to get in .
hey , man , you should get away from there .
oh , my god .
it smells like gas .
oh !
ohgod !
oh , my god !
help !
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
aah !
hold on , man !
outside the box .
keep thinkin '.
it's like chess .
don't look at just the next move . try to look 3 moves ahead .
this is crazy .
hey , mac , get over here .
you gotta see this the building's on fire .
bro , you getting this?
get out of the way !
should call campus security .
relax , man .
there's always fires during rush ek .
yeah , but that's pretty big .
what building is that?
dude , over here .
check this out .
what is it?
dude , over here .
check this out .
what is it?
there's always fires during rush week .
yeah , but that's pretty big .
dude , over here .
check this out .
3 times
professor wallace .
tuesday , 3 : 00 .
i know why the profiles never fit .
you were right to tell morgan not to rely on precedent .
the fires thus far have been completely task oriented .
so once they're set , the unsub is done?
exactly . the unsub is not a classical serial arsonist .
he's someone who uses fire because of a completely different disorder .
which is?
an extreme manifestation of ocd , obsessive compulsive disorder .
he does everything in 3s , and if i'm right , he'll have to kill again .
there's a form of ocd called scrupulosity .
religious obsession and coulsion .
an obsessive fear of committing sin , which creates so much anxiety that he's compelled to do something to ease that anxiety .
like setting fires .
where's the behavioral evidence?
right here . all right .
remember the night of the 3 fires?
we saw the doorknob turning against the lock .
t he's not tryg to get in .
he's compelled to turn the doorknob 3 times .
well , what about the fes?
the first ones were single fires .
if the unsub was ocd , shouldn't they have all been in 3s?
they were in 3s .
a trinity of 3s .
the first fire occurred on march third .
3 : 00 p. m. third day , third month .
it's that convergence of 3s that causes the overwhelming anxiety .
obsessive compulsives ease the anxiety by performing the compulsion .
what about the other fires?
professor wallace?
office number 3 .
i checked for more patterns of 3s .
his class was on tuesdays .
third day of the week .
matthew rowland was in that class .
it was his third class of the day .
if we looked into each of the fires we'd find a lot of patterns having to do with 3s because our minds are incredibly adept at seeking out patterns .
but to the unsub , once that pattern hits , bam he sets a fire .
but if the target was always people, why did no one die in the first few fires?
they were failures .
up until matthew rowland .
what is it?
i think i know who it mighte .
and it's not a he .
it's a she .
clara hayes .
a chemistry student .
i'll get you her records now .
first get campus security out and find her .
she could set her next fire within hours .
ok , got it . her apartment's off campus .
but how is he sure it's this girl?
when i was talking to her and her classmates ,
i noced something a ring on her finger .
and she kept turning it .
at intervals?
of 3 .
and she counted off the ingredients of a light bulb bomb .
potassium , sulfur , and normal sugar .
sugar .
and the word " sugar .
yeah .
and she kept repeating it .
once she started, she couldn't stop .
yeah , it's palilia .
it's the involuntary repetition of words .
howard hughes had it when his ocd worsened .
clara and her classmates were working on a project about gravitational pull .
the 3 body problem .
no one in here .
oh , you gotta be kidding me .
ocd?
i'm thinking more like omg .
omg?
oh , my god .
a fire is kindled in my anger , and shall burn into the lowest hell . " deuteronomy .
and again the fire of heaven came down and killed them all .
i do this for charon . " that's charon .
that's the greek mythological ferryman of the dead .
it's also the name of pluto's only moon .
paradise lost .
moloch , horrid king , besmeared with blood of human sacrifice and parents 'tears .
moloch was the demon sun god of the canaanites .
in order to keep from incurring his wrath , the people would sacrifice their children to him by burning them alive .
16 year old survives inferno .
the mother ellen hayes called it a miracle .
my daughter was tested by god .
he tested my child and she came through blessed . " look at the house number .
333 .
hey , morgan , you know what magical thinking is?
obsessive thoughts .
it's like a superstition . it controls them .
kinda like step on a crack, break your mother's back .
except she actually believes it .
god tested her with fire , and now when three 3s three 3s show up around another person ... god tells her to test them .
security's checking thscience building .
well , where else would she be?
we need to find the next pattern of 3s .
hey , hotch ... we're lookin ', man .
i don't think she would have left behind a day planner that says" set next fire here " written in it .
i under wait till you see this place .
uh , morgan?
i'll call you back .
there must be 30 homemade bombs in here .
morgan , seal the building get everybody out of there and walk away .
we need to send our people into every building and have them start pulling fire alarms . please , go .
mead , a map of the campus . we need toind anything and everything having to do with the number 3 . where's the blueprint?
hell no , i'm not leaving .
i have too much to do .
all right , .
i bought one of those mini halon fire extinguishers
they started selling them at the bookstore .
's pretty morbid , right?
hey , i'm about to get into an elevator , so i'll probably lose you .
all right , bye bye .
you got the sciencbuilding?
all the corridors and stairwells are clear .
e elevator closet's checked .
no elevators are in service .
it's not gonna start .
don't you have the key?
i put it back on the hook in the office .
aren't you supposed to be able to hear the emergency call button?
maybe it's broken .
or turned off .
i say we pry open the doors .
you can't pry 'em all the way open .
it's a safety precaution .
maybe we can try yelling for help .
that's the fire alarm .
jason , wait .
wait , wait , wait , wait .
clara hayes is very likely a good person .
someone who never wanted to do anyone any harm ,
like any other rational person .
but there's nothing rational about obseive compulsive disorder .
research suggests ocd involves oblems in communication between the frontal of the brain and the orbital cortex .
plus deeper structures .
the basal ganglia .
you can't reason with her because you can't reason with a physiological problem .
she's not setting these fires because she wants to , but because she has to .
what are you trying to say?
don't try to nvince her to stop, because you won't be able to .
that's it?
it won't go any further?
i told you , it's a built in safety precaution .
help ! somebody help us !
hello?
somebody help us !
please , somebody , we're trapped down here .
somebody help us !
clar clara , thank god .
it's all right .
clara , go back to the office and get the elevator key .
it's ok .
i'm here to save you .
go go get the key , clara . the elevator key .
clara !
clara , wait !
the key !
clara !
get the key !
is this building on fire?
not yet .
it's clear up here .
anything?
nothing .
no girl , no smoke , no fire .
where did she go?
maybe she's getting the key .
i don't know .
what is she doing?
someone coming to help?
i'm here to help .
i'm here to save you .
god chose you . chose you ... chose you ...
clara?
father , son ... oh , my god ! oh , my god !
holy ghost .
clara , listen ... aah !
aah !
it's gasoline !
aah !
aah !
no , clara !
stop it , clara !
listen !
oh , god !
security's sure that they've cleared the science building .
the guards made sure all floors are empty and no elevators are in service .
hold on .
you need a key to get it moving afte10 : 00 p. m.
clara?
clara?
god chose you .
put it down , clara !
i'm still looking . focus on the girl .
she's failing out . this was gonna be her last semester .
that's the stressor . what else?
she was a researcher in the science building .
we know that .
they've already cleared the science building .
the third floor of the science building is under construction .
i'm on my way .
clara .
clara , you don't have to do this , all right?
i have to do this .
you know it's not rational , clara .
you were trying to tell me .
god chose me to be tested , and now he's chosen them .
if i don't do this , something terrible will happen .
what's gonna happen , clara?
a flood?
an earthquake?
you know this isn't rational .
i know .
i know .
i know .
then resist .
i can't.
clara?
clara , listen to me .
clara , don't.
they must be tested .
god's wrath ...
clara , you told me it was ahemistry student .
you left the message about charown .
you want to stop .
fath , son ... clara ...
holy ghost .
clara , stop !
god chose them . i thought you said not to reason with her .
get us out of here .
you know , i figured it out .
the stutter .
you know why the footpath killer stuttered?
when you and hotch were talking earlier , that's when i got it .
he said he was just trying to stall clara .
right .
well , that's it , isn't it?
the footpath killer .
you were just trying to stall him .
you said , " i know why you stutter " because you were buying time .
you were stalling .
but you don't really know why he stuttered .
i don't?
i looked it up . one does .
