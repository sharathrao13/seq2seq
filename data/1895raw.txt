they called it the car for everyman .
henry ford himself called it a car for the " great multitude .
it was functional and simple , like your sewing machine or your cast iron stove .
you could learn to drive it in less than a day , and you could get any color you wanted , so long as it was black .
when ford first conceived the model t , it took 13 hours to assemble .
within five years , he was turning out a vehicle every 90 seconds .
of course , the real invention wasn't the car , it was the assembly line that built it .
pretty soon , other businesses had borrowed the same techniques .
seamstresses became button sewers .
furniture makers became knob turners .
it was the beginning and the end of imagination ... all at the same time .
howard?
charles , i'm talking to you .
hmm?
they need spokes , same as the others .
they oughta make a better spoke .
yeah?
then what would you do?
it was a land of opportunity .
the country was shrinking , and there was life to be made out west ... for any man with drive and ambition .
if your dream was big enough and you had the guts to follow it , there was truly a fortune to be made .
how are you , sir?
damn thing blew on me .
what?
it's a stanley steamer .
the boiler blew .
oh?
can you fix it?
uh ...
sure .
sure , i can fix it .
this is an amazing machine .
it's got a two stroke boiler system ... that's heated by this huge fire grate .
i mean , it's ...
well , it's basically a very small locomotive .
thank you .
now , i made some improvements .
it wasn't your boiler that was blowing ; it was your bleed valve .
so , with increased pressure , i can see you getting up to 40 miles an hour .
really?
oh , yeah .
and if you superheat the excess , i can see you reaching ...
fifty , maybe 60 miles an hour .
is that right?
easily .
and the thing of it is , mr. coughlin , you don't feed it , you don't stable it , and unless you hit a lamppost , the thing's not gonna get sick and die on ya .
that's funny .
to tell you the truth ,
i wouldn't spend more than five dollars on the best horse in america .
this is not the finish line , my friends .
this is the start of the race .
the future is the finish line !
and the new buick white streak is just the car to take us there !
four in line cylinders , 421/ 2 horsepower ,
wonderful .
this is the same car you can buy at any of our five showrooms across the bay area .
" the age of the automobile is here , " boasted howard . " the future has arrived .
oh , my .
read the part about the future again .
oh , i'm kind of dealing with it right now .
oh , sorry .
here .
i'll take him .
come here , big guy .
come here .
come here .
oh , are you the future , huh?
are you the future?
are you gonna ...
are you going to the moon?
the moon !
whee !
i'll take it .
do we really need all this?
no .
no .
we don't need it ...
there's also a caretaker's house , a paddock , a barn , some very nice stables .
how big are the stables?
got it .
settle down .
settle down .
quit .
quit .
whoa .
whoa .
whoa .
whoa .
come on , dad .
whoa .
there you go .
you're not getting him a horse .
why not?
he's great at it .
because he's 16 years old .
so?
so ... he should earn it .
all right .
all ...
all right .
quiet .
everybody knows it .
nobody knows longfellow .
dickinson .
ooh !
we never know how high we are ...
oh , i know that .
yeah .
i know .
i know it .
well?
we never know how high we are till we are called to rise .
good .
very good , john .
and then , if we are true to plan , our statures touch the skies .
excellent .
yes !
that's really good .
uh oh .
" the heroism ...
right .
right . " the heroism ...
the heroism we recite ...
would be a daily thing ,
that's it .
did not ourselves the cubits warp , for fear to be a king .
you should be riding it .
you knew the poem .
yeah .
but he looks so perfect out there , doesn't he?
yeah .
he does .
that's the poetry right there , agnes .
that's the poetry .
thank you .
thank you for coming .
i came here 15 years ago with 21 cents in my pocket .
i know a lot of us at the table have a story like that .
and , you know , i can't help thinking ... that if we can start out there and end up here , where can't we go in america?
hmm?
so , as corny as it sounds , i'd like to propose a toast to the future .
because out here , my friends , the sky is literally the limit .
to the future !
to the future !
to the future !
there were no suicides on wall street that day .
it was a myth that would grow over time .
the real effect of october 29 took a little longer to sink in .
by noon , all the gains of the previous year had been obliterated .
by 4 : 00 p .
m. , nearly $10 billion of market value was gone .
over the next two weeks , the hemorrhage continued .
and before long , 25 % of the workforce was unemployed .
a great national migration began .
their automobile .
and all at once , millions of americans ... had a new definition of home .
i made two dollars today .
what?
i made two dollars .
here .
where did you get these?
yeah , your boy combed 'em out , changed all the tack .
i didn't have to tell him a thing .
hey , red , attaboy !

i've never been over 115 .
where'd you learn to ride like that?
home .

here's the way it works .
i pay you $10 a week to ride .
you owe nine dollars for your meals , six dollars to sleep in the stalls , three dollar tack fee .

come on !
at a time when the world really needed a drink , you couldn't get one in the united states of america .
liquor was illegal .
diversions were scarce , and there's just so much a human being can do without .
soon , the border town was born , providing everything to the south that their neighbor to the north would not .
food , companionship , decent gin , and with gambling outlawed as well ,
the chance to turn bad luck into good .
relax !
you got it !
you got it !
you got it !
go !
that jockey was ridin 'like he's got an anvil in his pocket .
i'm gonna bet with you no more .
i no like it .
who's that?
george woolf , greatest jockey in the world .
that's charles howard?
yeah .
i thought he came down here for a ...
quickie divorce?
why?
look at him .
nothing quick about that .
it was in the palace of the great sultan .
sultan of where?
the sultan of araby .
i'd been living there for almost a year , racing his arabians across the desert by day ... and finishing my personal history of the region by night .
then one day , the sultan summons me into his throne room .
he looks at me and says ,
" john pollard ...
" john pollard , you are my greatest jockey .
it is you i have chosen to ride my hundred mile race from kusmat to tripoli .
200 mile .
all right .
200 mile .
excuse me , sahib .
you didn't need to wreck it , georgie .
when you started tellin 'that story , it was only 50 miles .
yeah , well , everything gets longer in the retellin '.
just ask your friend wanda over there .
you know , if you start ridin 'a little more and talkin 'a little less , you might start winnin 'some races .
i got two bucks says i beat you in this one .
i'm not sure if you do , but i got five says i beat you .

i wined her and dined her , and then i reclined her .
ah , shit .
what rhymes with siam?
that's great .

pretty obvious , huh?

i don't either .
ol !
so , what?
they brought you down here to make you feel better?

yes .
sort of .
those guys , they think everything is fixed with a party .
i'm sorry .
who are you?
oh .
marcela zabala .
my sister , isabella , she's married ...

i know .
nice to meet you .
charles .
mucho gusto .

nice and slow .
i'm fine .
i'm fine .
come on .
let me buy you some turtle soup .
i'm fine , george .
go win yourself a race or something .
let's go down to sloan's , and we'll just ...
i'm fine , george .
i don't need your help , and i sure as shit don't need your charity .
leave me alone , all right?
it's been 20 years since i've been on a horse .
don't worry .
it's the kind of thing that comes right back .
let's go .
come on !
what?
she got you back up on a horse , and now you wanna buy 'em?
yeah .
maybe .
maybe a couple .
you wanna win or just own 'em?
i wanna win .
what sort of question is that?
well , you're gonna need a trainer before you buy horses .
no .
you need two .
so you can fire one , eh?
randy thatcher's barn .
trains about 50 or 60 ponies .
good fella too .
real horse person .
a real horse shitter .
scusa .
now , now .
i don't know .
maybe you want a smaller barn , somebody who can take the time to ...
who's that?
huh?
oh , he's a crackpot .
lives alone in the bushes .
what's he do?
i don't know .
he used to be a trainer , farrier .
now he just looks after that horse .
come on .
let's look at another barn .
howdy .
hello .
wh ...
you hungry?
no .
no , thanks .
i'm fine .
charles howard .
tom ...
smith .
nice to meet you , tom .
what's ...
what's in his bandage?
oh , that's hawthorn root .
it increases circulation .
you wanna sit down?
oh .
all right .
thank you .
will he get better?
already is ... a little .
will he race?
no .
not that one .
so why are you fixing him?
'cause i can .
every horse is good for somethin '.
he could be a cart horse or a lead pony .
and he's still nice to look at .
you know , you don't throw a whole life away ... just 'cause he's banged up a little .
is that coffee?
yeah .
it's bad , though .
you always tell the truth?
well , i try to .
it ain't just the speed .
it's the heart .
you want something that's not afraid to compete .
half these horses are just show ponies .
you want something that's not gonna run from a fight .
how do you find that?
look , i won the robles handicap .
i was second in the tijuana derby .
i won the manzanita oaks .
you know , that used to be a stakes race .
i know .
i would've won t. j. , but the piece of shit lugged out on me .
sounds great .
we'll let ya know .
look .
i can work 'em out in the morning .
or even hot walk 'em if you need me to .
really?
you'll hot walk 'em?
this is somethin 'else .
a dream come true , walkin 'you around .
hook you up to a plow , pull me around for a little while .
come on .
you ever run in the money?
huh?
hey .
hey .
you ever run in the money?
i don't think so .
couldn't beat a human being , let alone another horse .
you goddamn sack of crap old plater .
probably the fastest you're gonna run in your entire life , you piece of shit old glue pot .
that's right .
the first time he saw seabiscuit , the colt was walking through the fog at 5 : 00 in the morning .
smith would say later that the horse looked right through him ... as if to say , " what the hell are you looking at?
who do you think you are?
he was a small horse , barely 15 hands .
he was hurting too .
there was a limp in his walk , a wheezing when he breathed .
smith didn't pay attention to that .
he was looking the horse in the eye .
god ... damn .
he was the son of hard tack , sired by the mighty man o 'war .
but the breeding did little to impress anyone at claiborne farms .
get rid of him .
at six months , he was shipped off to train with the legendary trainer sunny fitzsimmons , who , over time , developed a similar opinion of the colt .
is that a racehorse or a lead pony?
the judgment wasn't helped by his gentle nature .
where his sire had been a fierce , almost violent competitor ,
seabiscuit took to sleeping for huge chunks of the day ... and enjoyed lolling for hours under the boughs of the juniper trees .
his other great talent was eating .
though half the size of other colts , seabiscuit could frequently eat twice as much .
fitzsimmons decided the horse was lazy ... and felt sure he could train the obstinance out of him .
i want you to hit him as many times as you can over a quarter of a mile .
when he didn't improve , they decided the colt was incorrigible .
they made him a training partner to better horses , forcing him to lose head to head duels ... to boost the confidence of the other animal .
by the time he was three years old ,
seabiscuit was struggling in two cheap claiming races a week .
soon he grew as bitter and angry as his sire hard tack had been .
he was sold for the rock bottom price of $2, 000 .
and , of course , it all made sense .
champions were large , they were sleek , they were without imperfection .
when they finally did race him , he did just what they had trained him to do .
he lost .
what exactly is it you like?
he's got spirit .
i'll say .
can ...
can he be ridden?
oh , sure .
eventually .
he can be a little touchy .
yeah , i got it .
no .
really .
i'm fine .
jesus christ !
that horse is nuts !
come on !
come on !
come on !
let's go !
come on , you sons of bitches !
let's go !
come on !
let's go !
come on , you sons of bitches !
i'll take all of you !
come on !
come on !
it's okay .
i'm not afraid of you .
sure .
i know .
i know what you're all about .
you hungry?
huh?
yeah .
bet you are .
huh?
come on .
come on , boy .
yeah .
why don't you just breeze him around one turn .
give the folks a look .
right .
red pollard , mr. and mrs. howard .
yeah .
hi .
hello .
well , we'll just be movin 'on .
does he breeze?
well , we'll find out .
seems pretty fast .
yeah .
in every direction .
hell , he's so beat up , it's hard to tell what he's like .
i just can't help feelin 'they got him ... so screwed up runnin'in a circle , he's forgotten what he was born to do .
he just needs to learn how to be a horse again .
well , how do you do that?
how far do you want me to take him?
till he stops .
okay .
that seems like a pretty good ride .
hope so .
that's it , boy .
you're all right .
let's see what you got , boy .
ha !
ha !
ha !
ha !
whoo !
that's it , boy .
that's it !
yeah !
whoo !
whoo hoo !
well , at least he wasn't expensive .
no .
that's true .
whoo !
goddamn it !
you're an amazing animal !
whoo !
you can come inside , you know .
i'm fine .
thank you .
yeah , you look it .
no , really , i'm fine .
okay .
suit yourself .
welcome .
thank you .
you're welcome .
it's okay .
oh , i'm not that hungry .
mmm .
sure you're not .
it's just a lot of food .
it's okay .
rather have you strong than thin .
they called it " relief , " but it was a lot more than that .
n. r. a. , w. p. a. , the c. c. c.
but it really came down to just one thing .
for the first time in a long time , someone cared .
for the first time in a long time , you were no longer alone .
goat racing?
oh , no .
just trying to calm him down a little .
smart ones hate being alone all the time .
oh .
and sometimes another animal , it just ... just soothes them a bit .
pretty quiet in there .
what'd you do?
go take a look .
oh .
# rock of ages , cleft for me #
# i am hid and safe in thee #
# for the water and the blood #
# from thy riven ... #
okay .
you don't break him or anything , but we gotta see what he's got .
you take him to the 5 pole ... and turn him loose .
turn him loose?
yeah , son .
he's a racehorse .
ha !
ha !
come on !
come on !
ha !
come on !
i know you got more than this !
let's show 'em , boy !
how's he look?
asleep .
come on !
let's show 'em , pops !
come on !
whoo !
there it is !
yeah !
whoo !
oh , my .
yeah , you and me !
let's go !
whoo !
whoo hoo !
boy .
fast?
oh .
yeah .
how fast?
your horse just broke the track record at tanforan .
sometimes they ... they just , uh , hanker for a little competition .
as long as we're talkin 'long shots , i got a real doozy for you , folks .
we got a horse that's going off at 70 to 1 , and that's a short price , my friends .
this horse couldn't win a church raffle , let alone a $2, 000 allowance .
yeah , talk about a jump in class .
this is the skunk of the garden party .
yes , he's the surprise in the punch bowl .
as a matter of fact , i'll lay even money that this nag , seabiscuit , couldn't even finish six furlongs .
this is tick tock mcglaughlin live at clockers 'corner .
wow .
i wanted maroon .
they only had bright red .
oh , it looks great .
you don't think the " h " is too big?
you seen the size of our jockey?
come on .
okay .
favorite's that gray over there .
he's got a big late charge , so lock in early with him and stay right off his flank .
okay .
once our boy sees who the competition is , he'll do most of the work .
but don't move till that gray does .
what if it's late?
let's go .
twelve minutes to post .
i don't think it's gonna matter much .
honestly .
come on in .
number 3 , pollard on seabiscuit .
hey , sahib .
kinda small , isn't he?
gonna look a lot smaller in a second , georgie .
i got five bucks says he doesn't .
starter's poised .
the flag is up .
and there they go .
pirate's gold breaks first , followed by geronimo on the outside .
silver treasure is third , followed by seabiscuit .
they're coming by the five furlong pole .
it's pirate's gold , geronimo , hill's army and agua dulce .
whoa !
son of a bitch !
ha !
ha !
piece of shit bastard !
what the hell is he doing? ... opening up a 3 ... a 4 length lead ...
let's go !
what are you doing?
i'm gonna put you on the rail , you piece of shit !
get off of me !
how do you like that , you son of a bitch?
you're gonna drop me , man !
the two horses are flying down ...
you like the rail?
here comes the cavalry charge !
knock me off my horse !
it's silver treasure on the inside .
silver treasure on the inside .
silver treasure and pirate's gold .
and at the wire it's silver treasure .
aw , damn it .
what the hell were you thinkin '?
he fouled me .
what am i supposed to do , let him get away with that?
well , yeah , when he's 40 to 1 .
he almost put me in the rail !
well , did he?
look , we had a plan .
he fouled me , tom !
what am i supposed to do?
he cut me off !
he fouled me !
son?
son .
what are you so mad at?
there's a phone next door .
we'll call you .
every couple of weeks , we'll call you and tell you where we are .
no .
we're just gonna go home .
all right?
you have a gift .
you have a gift .
i need to borrow some money .
all right .
i , uh ,
i haven't been to a dentist , and m ...
well , l i need to borrow some money .
that's fine .
i don't know when i can pay you back .
i mean , when we win .
when we win , i can pay you back .
that is if you still want me to ride .
of course i want you to ride .
how much do you need?
uh , ten dollars .
here .
than ...
uh ...
it's fine .
thank you .
i really appreciate it .
that's it , pops .
we're okay now .
it's all right , boy .
yeah , we're okay .
nothing to worry about .
all the time in the world , boy .
that's it , pops .
nice lead .
just like that , boy .
just like that .
what do you think , boy?
you ready to go?
you and me .
let's go , boy .
let's go .
ha !
ha !
ha !
ha !
whoo !
in the end , it wasn't the dams ... or the roads or the bridges or the parks .
or the tunnels or the thousands of other public projects ... that were built in those years .
it was more invisible than that .
men who were broken only a year before ... suddenly felt restored .
men who'd been shattered suddenly found their voice .
well , i just think this horse has a lot of heart .
he may have been down , but he wasn't out .
he may have lost a few , but he didn't let it get to him .
we could all learn a lick or two from this little guy .
oh , and by the way , he doesn't know he's little .
he thinks he's the biggest horse out there .
so you got big plans for this little horse?
oh , yeah .
see , sometimes when the little guy , he doesn't know he's a little guy , he can do great big things .
can we get a shot here?
see , this isn't the finish line .
the future is the finish line , and the biscuit is just the horse to get us there .
just the horse to get us there .
you certainly made a believer out of me , mr. howard .
it's time for this old tout to eat some crow .
four and 20 blackbirds , to be exact , all baked up in some humble pie , and i'll take mine la mode .
oh .
and one more thing , mr. howard .
i just wanna say ...
thanks for the champagne .
don't mention it .
did you see the infield?
no , not yet .
take a look .
your little horse is sellin 'out the cheap seats .
