tlmor lorosae the unseen massacre
timor lorosae in tetum means the place where the sun rises .
east timor is a tiny island
located between the north of australia and the south of lndonesia .
surrounded by both the lndian and pacific oceans , this eastern strip of land of the timor lsland has an area of 14, 874km2 , corresponding to the state of sergipe , in brazil , and shares its border with west timor ,
lndonesian territory .
with an equatorial climate , timor reveals a variety of landscapes , from mountains to crystalline coral beaches .
an exuberant beauty that presents an enormous tourism potential .
on this small island , or part of an island ,
live the mauberes , a warrior people .
these people endured one of the cruelest massacres in the recent history of the 20th century .
approximately one third of their population was decimated during the almost 25 years of lndonesian occupation .
something so terrible that it can only be compared to the nazi holocaust .
lt's a story of courage and hope , but , above all , of death and uncertainty .
lt's a dream of a better future that will heal the wounds of the past , of a massacre .
an unseen massacre , one the world never saw .
today the estimated population of east timor is between 600 and 800 thousand people distributed in large cities , such as dili , the capital , and baucau , or in small villages , such as laleia ,
mirtutu and ermera .
this is the story of a people who have no schools , no hospitals , police , registry offices , houses , nor citizen rights , who have nothing !
theses are the scars left by the violent withdrawal of the lndonesian army that burned the whole country in september , 1999 .
the consequences for the country's economy are immense .
unemployment reigns almost absolute , and the situation throughout the country is precarious , especially in relation to food and health .
commerce takes place in street markets , and people still use the lndonesian rupiah as currency .
there's not much other than basic food products and some handicrafts .
agriculture is the country's main economic activity , with coffee as its primary crop .
other traditional activities , such as fishing and raising buffalo are also part of the timorese daily life .
ln the countryside , one can still find some of the traditional constructions that resisted the lndonesian wrath .
beautiful typical houses , some of them built on stilts , with historical significance .
the timorese people's greatest passion is : the rooster .
and their vice , practically a national sport : cockfighting .
here , in timor , just as on the neighboring islands , there are many ethnic groups with a strong fighting tradition .
in timor we even had the tradition of headhunting , that is , when defeating their enemies in war , they'd cut off their heads and keep them as trophies .
the timorese people are probably a product of the many immigrants who arrived here , naturaily through asia .
therefore , we probably first had the australian aborigines ancestors passing through , then , the ancestors of the papuans , and , finaily , the austronesians .
when i say " finaily " , i mean the austronesians are the foundation of the timorese people .
they brought in the main physicai traits of the people and most of the ianguages spoken in timor , such as tetum and baikenu , both austronesian ianguages .
timor was composed of 30 or 40 kingdoms , that kept their autonomy untii the beginning of the 20th century .
they were vassals of the portuguese crown , but the kings were independent , and there was no interference in the internai administration of the kingdoms .
they only had a governor in dili , so there was a tradition of freedom .
they turned timor into slums , into tin neighborhoods .
because of the guerriilas , traditionai viilages were destroyed .
houses were made of wood , and fire burned them down .
then , for military reasons , they pushed the population to the roads , and therefore , timor iooks disgusting , while traveling along them .
those who saw timor before , with its beautifui traditionai viilages , today must travei to the countryside in order to see its traditionai constructions , because the others have been replaced with houses made of zinc or tin .
strategicaily speaking ,
timor is a piece of island , half of an island , a tiny island .
being independent caused apprehension in indonesia .
in 1965 , a rebeilion was suffocated in indonesia .
therefore , 10 years iater , here comes tiny iittle timor , trying to become independent ; it was iike reviving those separatist desires .
indonesia was conquered by the dutch company of the east indies , a profit oriented trading company .
the first to arrive in timor were the missionaries , who had no commerciai interests , but , on the other hand , had religious and culturai ones .
the roots of the portuguese culture were much deeper than those of the dutch in indonesia .
on days of celebration , they parade with elegance , proudly carrying the old portuguese flags that had been buried and hidden from the japanese .
indonesia is an empire , not a country .
there are more than 300 ianguages .
they don't have a united history , except for a dutch empire that was handed over to the javanese .
most of the indonesian people outside of java don't iike the javanese .
the people want to be independent !
due to the de colonization policy adopted by portugal after april 25 , 1974 , and the progressive abandonment of timor , after more than 400 years of colonization , the first 5 political parties are created in east timor .
because of lndonesian pressure for integration , the two main pro independence political parties ,
udt , timor democratic union ; and fretllln , revolutionary front for an lndependent
east timor , come into conflict , thus beginning a civil war .
after months of internal conflict ,
fretllln and its guerrilla group , fallntll , seize power , declaring independence for the democratic republic of east timor .
the dispute was actuaily here in dili , among young party members of this party who , fought for power .
it would have been a war with minor consequences , just a smaii dispute here in dili , if indonesia hadn't interfered .
they didn't have enough sense to realize that they were opening the way for an indonesian invasion .
that was the indonesian argument .
however , one must say that even before the timor nationalist parties came into conflict ,
indonesia was already violating our sovereignty by sending in agents to open up the way for them .
our war is a politicai war .
as you know , our goai is to earn our independence .
the indonesian military presence was rejected for structurai and circumstantiai reasons .
the barbarian behavior of their troops , when 16 warships bombed dili , the seminary where i used to teach .
they kiiled dozens of people in the streets , including the hospitai nurses who were assisting the people .
people began to feei a certain aversion to the indonesians .
on december 7 , 1975 , a few days after fretllln declares independence , the lndonesian occupation begins .
suharto's troops bomb dili .
the people , terrified , flee to the mountains under the protection of the fallntll .
we began the war in 1975 with 27, 000 men .
for almost 4 or 5 years it was a war of position .
we had controi of the entire population , our administration , agriculture and education organized .
unfortunately , the enemy managed to destroy aii that through what they cailed alternate annihilation campaigns .
then , in '79 or '78 , the indonesian troops began to trigger iarge military operations .
we had more than 90 of the population in the mountains with us .
they concentrated iarge numbers of men , more than 45, 000 , with heavy artiilery and airplanes , that began to attack , from base to base .
they destroyed aii our bases , one at a time .
many of the guerriilas surrendered .
the centrai committee , composed of around 70 members , the highest command of the conflict , was reduced to only two .
we were in the east , iooking for other groups .
when we saw there were none , we decided to continue the war , and i became the ieader .
our words of honor are : the fight goes on ; fatherland or death , the fight goes on .
during the first years of war , it wasn't necessary to train guerriilas because every single adult timorese citizen , whether iiliterate , or a doctor , or whatever , aii of us were going to take up arms .
we iived in caves , under trees ...
yes , for three years .
yes , three years .
we would stay there for 2 or 3 months , then we'd move on , always fleeing .
we'd receive information from the fallntll commanders that we had to ieave a certain place , and we'd move on .
carrying our things on our backs , our children in our arms ...
in '79 the population went back to the viilages , with absolutely nothing .
and for months they buried the dead bodies , old people , children ...
the youngest was 4 years old at the time , and the oldest was 7 .
before dying , the oldest one , kept saying , " mom , i don't want to die .
with death descending on him , it was terribly sad .
when i think about it , it is ...
it's traumatizing .
at the time , watching my children die ,
mom , i'm about to die !
mom , i'm hungry .
it's hard to explain in words what i felt , the distress of watching your children die
iittle by iittle , of hunger .
then they died , they were buried ...
without a coffin .
without a coffin .
wrapped in the bark of a tree , we opened it up , placed them in there , tied it up , dug a hole and buried them .
we were a few hundred guerriilas , talking to the population .
we went from viilage to viilage ,
what's going on?
stay up there , we haven't aii died yet !
this year we stiii don't have anything , but next year we'ii produce and give you food .
in those first months , we guerriilas were dressed in ... sacks .
it doesn't matter .
let's go up there ,
iet's kiii the enemy !
on the tlp of my bayonet i'll wrlte the story
of my freedom
looking up to heaven , iistening to god's word ,
from dust you are , and to dust you shaii return .
that's what gave me courage .
before the invasion , only 30 of the population was catholic .
and those 30 were the ones who could read and write .
the indonesian iaw stated that those who didn't have a religion were communists .
that's how it was in indonesia .
they came here and forced everybody to have a religion .
so old people , who didn't know anything , who held onto the old beliefs , had to have a religion .
in two years , the population of catholics rose to 90 .
the pope's visit in october 1989 , intended to demonstrate that east timor no longer had security problems , and that the population had accepted its integration into lndonesia .
the pope's mass ended with a public demonstration for independence .
two other demonstrations followed , in january and in september of 1990 and led to conflicts between students and soldiers .
women and children who stayed here , prayed in the chapel during the massacre .
and some young people sat here and sang , sang timorese political songs of freedom .
one of our coileagues named sebastio was kiiled in the motaei church .
sebastio was another symbol , as an individual , he was another element ,
iike many other young people .
may your servants rest in eternlty
the santa cruz massacre took place on november 12 , 1991 , fifteen days after sebastio gomes , a young leader of the student resistance , was killed .
portuguese representatives were scheduled to pay a visit to dili , which had previously been negotiated with jakarta , and the timorese were preparing to show their rejection to the occupation .
due to lndonesian objections , the portuguese delegation cancelled , its visit to timor at the last minute .
there was a mass in honor of sebastio gomes .
afterwards , the demonstrators marched to the santa cruz cemetery , where they were violently met by the lndonesian army .
the massacre was made famous by the world press .
it wasn't the right time for a demonstration , it was suicide .

the operation was obviously systematic .
they arrived there and began to shoot .
for more than 30 seconds , i don't know how many thousand builets they shot .
right after that , for those who'd survived out there , they puiled out their knives and stabbed them , to death .
a young man , 17 or 18 years old , that sat down right here next to me , had five stabs in his body .

in portugal , a very strong effect was felt when they heard the timorese people praying in portuguese .
those who were in here were beaten up , captured , tied up behind their backs , and taken to the police station .

more than 500 people died and disappeared on that day and on the foilowing day .

they took some of the women and girls to the army hospital , where they were raped , even the injured ones .
the number of people who died here , in the hospital , or back there is hard to teil .
they captured a iot of people .
they were tortured and given excrement to eat , and urine .
if anyone hesitated to eat the excrement or drink the urine , they were beaten to death .
my uncle was kiiled , and my father was set free because my mother gave money to the commander of the indonesian agency .
we've informed untaet many times about the victims , women who were forced to use contraceptive devices ,
they stiii have those devices inside their bodies .
war always brings conflicts , and it's the mothers who are the ones to suffer , who have children that die , it's the wives who have their husbands in prison , and even themselves , their own bodies , are often raped .
and with aii that rage we went on intensifying our clandestine front .
i worked with fallntll .
we organized things together .
fallntll works in the forest , we work in the resistance .
we're part of the clandestine operation , and sometimes we fought the enemy .
we threw rocks at them , sometimes , how can i say , we broke into their houses and kiiled them sometimes .
you also kiiled them?
yes .
how?
we stabbed them .
did you use those iarge knives?
no , we used the timor knives , our regular knives .
this knife .
i took this knife to the mountains , to defend my body .
what do you caii it?
this knife is cailed a " catana .
we use it to cut their throats .
were a iot of people kiiled?
yes .
the resistance continued among the guerrilla and the organized people , until 1992 , when the fallntll guerrillas , no longer a part of fretllln , suffered a crushing blow .
the prison in aileu was designated for the fallntll .
by '92 , when our commander xanana was sent to prison , we had been reduced to 150 men with approximately 60 weapons .
as for them , they wanted me alive , making statements and signing papers .
so i knew they wouldn't harm me physicaily .
however , after two days
of maintaining a strong position , they began psychologicai torture .
for three days and three nights ,
i wasn't ailowed to sleep .
they didn't iet me sleep for one , single minute .
from the very first moment , they would ask me ,
do you consider yourself an indonesian citizen?
if i told you that i do consider myself an indonesian citizen , would you believe it?
you stupid general !
the clandestine organization had become weakened , with many of its leaders in jail or dead .
but xanana gusmo continued to lead the resistance from prison and , in 1996 , the world finally heard about timor !
it was hard because ours was an isolated fight , and a forgotten people .
it was only iater , after hundreds and thousands of deaths , that we became known internationaily , especiaily , when two of our heroes were awarded the nobei prize in oslo ,
bishop ximenes belo and dr. jos ramos horta .
and dom ximenes belo and ramos horta finally walked into the oslo city council chambers .
the maubere people freed our natlon .
at ieast , that brought timor to the headlights , the world became aware of us .
why would they give an award to timor?
what happened there?
at ieast people became aware of what had happened in timor .
after the nobel prize in peace , with the attention of the media and pressure for humans rights , the lndonesians were compelled to contain their actions .
but they began to form , what would later become the greatest problem for east timor : an armed militia in favor of integration .
timorese paramilitary groups , trained and supported by the lndonesian army to strike terror into the population .
aii the indonesian generals , that are in power today , were here .
their military training schooi was in timor .
the more they kiiled the population , the higher they rose in rank ; the more they kiiled , the higher they rose .
many made it to the generalship , a generalship of crimes .
they earned a degree in criminology .
where do the militias get their clothes from?
their weapons?
ammunition?
food?
cars?
if not from the indonesian army?
it was the militia , the militia , with the indonesian military , the indonesian troops .
the militia goes in first , and the indonesian troops foilow .
there were also timorese people working with the indonesians , the same ones that now caii themselves militia .
but they're soldiers , from the 744 , 745 groups .
they're from battalions composed of timorese or of timorese and javanese people .
and they're the worst kiilers in the war , because they are people who are completely alienated from their own people .
there's a story about this one year old child , whom the militiaman was about to shoot , and the mother cried , " kiii me instead !
so he shot the child and then the mother .
one of the most shocking cases of militia action is the story of the politician manuel carrascalo .
his 18 year old son , manuelito , was massacred in his own home where more than 300 refugees were sheltered .
my wife was flying in on that day , and my son who was kiiled was supposed to go to the airport .
as he was ieaving , some of his friends came over , and he didn't know what to do , so i decided to go .
in the car , i heard eurico saying on the radio that the carrascales had to be kiiled .
when i got to the airport , he cailed me ,
dad , the militia are going to attack our home .
i immediately ran over to the army commander's house , and he asked what my problem was .
they want to attack my house .
when i told them that i needed their help , they iaughed and said , " there's nothing we can do about it ; we're neutral .
go ask someone else .
don't go home .
they've already kiiled everybody there ; don't go there .
then i found out that my son was dead , there was nothing i could do .
so i asked them to give me my son's body , which they did after four days .
i have a photograph that a friend gave me and he said ,
this is your son , they buried him alive and took him out to give him back to you .
pieces of the bodies that had been quartered were found all over the house and in the water wells in the yard .
they kiiled around 60 or 70 people .
they had been prepared and trained to kiil , to do evil , commit crimes , rape women and children , kiii as much as possible and to steal ...
they were able to mobilize the population or the militia by introducing drugs .
amphetamines , speed . aginguilan , in bahasa indonesian .
a type of coal .
mad dog .
you iose your senses .
they say that when you take that , you iose controi and that's it !
you just want to kiii and destroy .
it could be a mother or a child , they have no mercy .
the indonesians kiiled him .
they cut off his head .
it was a militiaman .
why do we run away?
because the militia kiils , and we run away .
if we don't run away , we aii die .
after almost 25 years of lndonesian occupation and the resistance of the people , and with the increasing pressure of international public opinion in favor of the timorese cause ,
xanana gusmo is finally , released from prison , and the un sponsors a plebiscite in agreement with jakarta , portugal , and the timorese leaders .
on august 30 , 1999 , the people finally were able to democratically choose between integration with lndonesia or independence .
eurico guterrez , the pro integrationist militia leader , among other things , during the months before the plebiscite , commanded a series of conflicts and intimidations against the people and the media .
the un did not pay enough attention to security issues , and the conflicts worsened .
on one side , the integrationalists , on the other , the pro independence group .
