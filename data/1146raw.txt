ln the meantime , wanna buy something?
i wish i could , dude .
i'm broke .
i'm broke .
just let me hang out .
i'm your best customer .
i'm here every day .
but you never spend money .
you gotta start spending money .
money spending is good .
little man !
i told you already .

i don't care .
they're all the same shape .
i want my board , right there .
that one .
let me get all three of those .
i can do that for you .
bam special .
bam !
bam .
hey , what's up?
what's up , man?
do you remember me?
probably not .
we skated scrap together a couple years ago .
oh , yeah .
dude , yeah .
you were ripping .
thanks , bro .
keep an eye on this kid .
thanks .
watch out for this guy's frontside 360 .
he's got the ssbsts lurking .
it's for the wall .
you going to the demo later on?
hell , yeah .
i wouldn't miss it .
it's for the wall .
you don't have to make excuses .
sorry .
bam was a loser before he got sponsored .
just like you , dude .
thanks .
i'll tell you what .
i'm gonna make you a deal , greg .
you flow me one of these decks .
for free?
yeah , for free .
exactly .
and in exchange , i'll skate it .
i'll tell everybody where i got it .
you can sponsor me .
all right , dude .
which one do you want?
for real?
all right .
how about we go with one of those elements , like bam got?
dude , for you , i can go that board $ 1 40 .
tax not included .
nice hat .
we're late .
let's go .
shut up .
i still can't believe it .
bam just walks in and greg tosses him a handful of his decks .
i can't wait to get my own deck .
i did the math .
there's 53 guys who make a living skating and about a million wannabes like us .
and?
and nothing .
but until a sponsor backs a tour bus into my driveway ... ... l have to work all summer to pay for school .
i don't believe you .
you're still gonna bail on me .
you know what?
matt listened to your crap , and look where that got him .
the guy is a complete stain .
matt deceives you .
i don't
he does because he , in actuality , really knows which end is up .
what's up , man?
so dustin's bailing on us again .
really?
i'm gonna alert the press , man .
dustin's always bailing .
i'll always skate .
i just won't be homeless with you .
you say that , but i know you mean something else .
before you know it , you'll be a fat , middle aged male with a nice beer gut ... ... divorced about 20 times , wishing you were skating again .
dudes .
get the moron out of the pool .
matt .
when is the moron gonna release his death grip on our premises?
have you smelled it lately?
it's like an open sewer .
good to see you too , pops .
we need to talk about your future .
yeah , you know , i'd love to , but we're heading out to this ....
sugarplum .
i hate when he calls me that .
listen , remember our deal .
dad , l  don't " dad " me .
we had a deal .
you're either in school , or you're at rivers hardware working next to your old man .
sniffing a little of that lacquer while you're mixing the paint .
come on !
obvious perks there .
it's a good living .
it's a good future .
it's a good life .
i'll tell you that much .
think about it .
yeah .
let's go , honey .
get in there , you little ....
dude , your stepmom is so hot .
see the way she was looking at me?
i was like ....
hello?
good afternoon , chili n such .
can i scoop for you?
i'd like chili , fire in the hole ... ... hotter than hell , make it meat in the ass .
hey there .
hi , i ordered a tummy killer ranchero ... ... and i got a double chunk gut bomb with cheese by mistake .
i'd like what i ordered .
sorry , sir .
hello?
i didn't get that , sir .
could you?
could you repeat that?
open your ears , jackass !
yeah , i see that you already ate the gut bomb , though .
yeah , but i can't help it that i didn't figure it out until i'd swallowed it all .
you really think you need another?
what?
mr. knight , let me handle this .
sir , our policy clearly states every customer will be served to his satisfaction .
customer may receive a replacement excuse me , i'll be right with you .
a replacement will be given as long as he has a receipt .
you have one?
all right , that's good .
give him one of these .
you're late , eric .
you're just a little bit late .
and late is not great .
do you wanna go to the restroom before i reload you?
you want me to call the grownup back?
you're probably leaking beans .
one big scoop .
that's two , but two is enough .
two is plenty .
now , let's go over here and do the cheddar .
two scoops of cheddar , one scoop of onion .
that's very good , son .
you know , eric , you've got great potential .
just go to it .
you go to it , deputy .
attaboy !
fire in the hole !
one fire in the hole there .
no , sir , we don't have diet .
two hours till the demo .
let's get this place cleaned up and get out .
i can't .
i need the overtime .
oh , boy !
boy !
someone really abused the men's room .
it's like a doody bomb exploded .
was he a tall guy with glasses maybe?
just a hunch .
think this is funny , mr. knight?
no , i don't .
show a little team spirit .
go in there and make it sparkle .
here you go .
it'll be my pleasure .
thank you , sir .
hey , listen .
wear gloves , buddy .
keep laughing , eric , but i'm gonna be at college in the fall , and you'll still be here .
and you , sir .
there's a birthday party at table 1 3 .
need you in the bean suit .
you're kidding me .
the bean suit again?
bean suit right away .
thank you , sir .
whose birthday is it?
ours .
i'm sheriff bean .
ladies and gentlemen , put your hands together and scream ... ... because it is on today , chicago .
i don't know if you were praying last night , but we got some great weather today .
i can't believe you quit .
shut up and pay attention .
this is insane .
i've never seen anyone do these lines at the park .
cold?
jimmy wilson !
give it up !
that's right , chicago .
jimmy , over here !
look at all those hot chicks lining up to get a crack at him .
there is no bruised fruit in that medley .
no beasts .
you know what?
it's more than that .
this guy is skating for a living .
you guys wanna go check out the vert?
yeah .
mommy !
can you move , in case one of those skaters looks over here?
i'm a professional skater , baby .
yeah , right .
i'm telling you the truth .
i'm not skating today , because i thrashed my arm .
here , smell this .
you think it's more like pepperoni or ass crack?
i got 5 bucks on pepperoni .
you're so gross , man .
you'll be back .
think he does his own laundry?
are you kidding me?
he gets sick of his shirt , he takes it off and he gets a new one for free .
i want !
you need to earn your rank here .
check it out .
jimmy wilson !
yeah !
can you imagine for five seconds what it must be like to ride in that thing?
hell , yeah .
girls , money ... ... signing autographs , making the girls go
look at this .
look at this .
no way , man !
pinch me .
let's go .
don't i know you from chili n such?
breasts .
i like them two at a time and round .
ladies !
i represent the release the twins foundation .
you guys wanna make a little donation?
what are you talking about?
about releasing those twins .
they look uncomfortable in their little cages .
come out !
it's no wonder why you can't get a date .
it was working .
i'm in a dry spell , man .
to be in a dry spell ...
... you've had to have been in a wet spell .
i've had sex .
yeah , with a human , though .
who's making these rules , man?
product toss .
i love it when these little freaks tear each other's skin off for a sticker .
what is he doing?
i had to skin a 9 year old for that , man .
you needed a board .
it's yours .
let's see if we can talk to jimmy before we jet .
excuse me , sir , we're here to see jimmy .
oh , my freaking lord !
oh , my god !
get it away .
what are you looking at?
nothing , sir .
we are just here to see jimmy . ls he in the scar?
the car?
the bus?
that where he is?
that's a big " no " on jimmy .
good .
thank you .
what are you looking at , pinhead?
no .
what's up?
actually , we're here to see jimmy .
he told me to drop this tape by for him .
i think he wants to sponsor us .
that's cool .
i'm stoked .
that's great , guys .
hang on just a minute .
all right .
let's see .
cool .
there you go .
yeah .
this is just today's haul .
excuse me , that's all from today?
yeah .
" sponsor me . " two very popular words .
how does he have time to watch all those?
well , he's worked out this technique where he doesn't watch any of them .
it's working out really well for him .
yeah .
should i bounce these nerds out of here?
no , they're cool .
you guys are cool , right?
yeah , we're straight .
i'm cool .
it's okay .
all right .
so i'm here to help you .
i don't want you to get in trouble .
because the truth is , jimmy did want us to come by and say what's up , you know?
and if you could just get us in for two minutes ....
i can do that .
you can do that .
but i'm not going to do that , because i don't want to .
and i just can't seem to find my way around that .
i'm sorry .
i really wish you guys all the best in the world , sincerely .
you know , but you know , hey .
guys , just skate , you know?
and if you're really any good , then someone will find you .
all right?
all right .
now would be a good time .
hey !
get out of here !
nice kids .
i like them .
don't you like them?
i like them .
all right , so pack your shit .
we're going on tour .
when do we leave?
did somebody see our tapes?
whose team are we on?
hold on .
hold on .
live for your viewing pleasure .
we are super duper skates .
dear lord , eric !
i am never , ever going to wear that .
the whole thing sort of sounds sketchy .
i'm sorry .
i never heard of this super duper skates .
yeah , i know .
that's because i just made it up .
wake up and smell the desperation .
we needed a company name to give us credibility on tour .
on tour?
right .
we're hitting the road as a team .
we skate better than half of those guys .
yeah , i can .
it's weird .
there you go .
jimmy's a man , right?
once we're on the road , we follow him around .
we get in front of him one time , he'll see we're the real deal .
that does sound super duper .
but i really don't i mean , i'm just saying , if you think about it
no , it's cool .
it's cool .
you two can sit here and touch yourselves ... ... for the rest of your lives , or you can try getting off your asses and making it happen .
that's about a nine on the richter scale , man .
i think he's saying we got a nest egg here , and we're extraordinarily comfortable .
slug bug !
mr. rivers !
slug bug !
mr. rivers .
kids dig me .
when's her lease up?
where's the money we're using ... ... on this trip coming from?

you have no choice .
i absolutely am not doing it .
i can't .
you can .
no .
don't even talk i'm not .
there's no way in hell i'm doing it .
what?
now that the money issue is settled , where are we gonna get some wheels?
we just got to find a van .

have you been in a coma this entire time?
they're everywhere .
sweet lou is all over this little pro chick right now .
why does that bother you so much?
because it's not happening to me .
lf you would change your clothes , even one time , there might i don't know .
what's wrong with you?
my college fund is gutted .

maybe i can get my job back .
you know what , sweet lou?
i got a rule , man .
no more of these freaky , spazzy chicks ... ... coming across state lines with us , man .
that's what's bringing this team vibe down !
it's my van .
it's my rules .
and i like her .
at least there's no way in hell that this could get any worse .
ln the name of all things holy .
are you kidding me , man?
i'm sorry .
are you upset with the fact that i've worked hard and saved money?
and with that money , i happened to buy a little food for myself?
it's bread .
no !
i said , no girls !
no !
god , stop !
damn it !
at least she left our stuff .
touch .
we're gonna die out here .
we have no food and no car .
seriously , anyone , what are we gonna do?
i thought she was a sweet girl .
that's her ass you're thinking about , not her depraved criminal mind .
wham , bam , steal the van .
we just need something .
some kind of sign to tell us to keep going .
do we?
i'm sure we're gonna get a sign .
look , jimmy wilson is coming over the hill right now to give us a big deal .
there he is .
look , there's his bus , and he's got a scholarship for me .
oh , no , wait .
that's a mirage because we're in the middle of the desert !
tucson , that's where we're headed?
yeah .
that's good .
no one's food here !
i just had the wildest dream , man .
what are you doing?
save me !
look !
it's a lizard !
i just got violated by a lizard , man .
actually , that felt kind of good .
somebody's coming .
all right , you guys hang back .
all right?
and hide matt .
come here , buddy .
did you just say , " buddy "?
shut up .
nice ass !
hey .
i'm on my way to tucson .
climb in .
what's up?
hi .
how are you?
real good .
sweet lou !
nice catch , man .
all right , i'll check you guys later .
that ain't gonna happen .
what?
come on .
do you work out?
can we sit down and talk about it?
bam !
bam !
what's up?
what's going on?
remember me from ...?
the skate shop , right?
skate shop .
exactly .
he's with me .
i'm with him .
so how's everything going?
yeah , really good .
so this is crazy , huh?
yeah , it is pretty insane .
i know your schedule and everything like that has gotta be pretty nuts ... ... but if you have five minutes , could you just check this out?
it's a tape we put together .
could you pass it on to jimmy?
i got so much shit on my plate , the last thing i need now ... ... is looking at some random " sponsor me " tape .
sorry about that .
that's cool .
i figured i'd give it a shot .
give me the tape .
of course i'll watch it .
i'm not that big of a dick .
thanks .
that's great .
cool .
you talking shit about me?
jamie , do you really wanna do this now?
have the balls to say it to my face .
okay , i'm saying it to your face .
i don't want you here .
okay?
the last thing i need on this tour ... ... is some haggard ass chick lurking around .
just take it easy , man .
what?
you serious?
yeah , relax .
i mean , she doesn't need you insulting her .
lf you wanted me to watch your tape , you pretty much ruined that .
so ....
thanks .
hey , so , that was pretty harsh , huh?
i think i can take care of myself .
no , i figured that .
i mean , i can tell , but ....
you know , everybody could use a little backup once in a while .
wanna get out of here?
you serious?
i don't think anybody is home .
let's just get in and out real fast , okay?
hello?
anybody home?
hey , matt , don't touch anything , okay?
mirrored ceilings .
we got this place to ourselves , man .
oh , black leather .
that's just how snoop would do it .
oh , come on .
good .
hey , ladies ... ... l'm jimmy wilson .
tonight you're gonna be my love slaves .
there it is .
stop it for five seconds .
all right , jimbo , just gonna bust a little switcheroo .
you hit play , you're gonna enjoy the super duper team demo .
i've been holding it for two days .
it's about to go downtown .
good idea .
take a crap on his bus .
he would appreciate that .
i got it .
let's go .
all right , dude , let's go .
i did it .
let's go .
dude .
i might not get a piece of jimmy wilson , but he got a piece of me .
that smells like hermit craps .
that was amazing , jimmy !
i've been waiting two years to pull that trick .
we got it on footage , check it out .
let's see it .
oh , no .
what the hell?
tell me that's not your only copy of the tape .
somebody broke the tour rule .
i'll fix this .
let's get out of here .
who did number two on the bus , man?
how many times do i have to tell them?
no going number two on my bus !
so basically ... ... we've been following the jimmy wilson tour all over the country .
that's insane .
yeah .
it sucks .
i had this whole thing planned out .
all we had to do , get in front of him , and it was so easy .
he just had to see us skate , and he'd pick us up .
but ... ... of course , we found a way to screw everything up ... ... and the whole thing has turned into a disaster .
you can't argue with talent .
so ... ... just keep skating , and someone will find you .
i know about these things .
you must .
i guess , by the way things went down , you guys have been hooking up for a while .
you think i'm into bam because he's on tour?
i don't know .
i thought that's how things went around here .
everyone hung out with the pros and did their thing .
tour slut at your service .
no !
i didn't i really didn't mean it like that .
i ....
it's just , you know , you're super cute .
i'd throw myself under the wheels of jimmy's bus ... ... to get a chance to be with a girl like you .
you're sick !
you're sick !
that's sick !
i know you .
we got on jimmy wilson's bus , and matt took a big crap on it .
i don't know if it was the stroganoff or what , but i was like
stop .
wonderful .
these are my friends by default and not by choice , and we're leaving right now .
all right .
see you .
bye , friends .
sometimes eric looks like he man .
so , what's up?
let's go .
excuse me , sorry .
i got a code brown to wrestle down to the ground .
oh , my god !
there she is , boys .
what do we do now , man?
i don't know , dude .
look at this guy .
ls this guy gonna stop?
shit !
god , jackass !
man , those things are awesome .
he's not playing piano anytime soon , man .
guys , come on .
come on , come on !
go , go , go , go , go !
come on !
kick the thing !
come on !
hey , you all right?
they didn't see it .
but i sure did .
i'm sick and tired of you punks thinking you can skate wherever the hell you feel like .
sir , we're at a skate demo .
smart ass .
you know , i could have you guys arrested .
come here .
but for once , i'm gonna have you skaters take care of your own mess .
sweet lou cleans no man's poop .
have fun , girls .
so to recap ... ... we smell like turds , we have no car , no jimmy wilson ... ... and i'm broke .
call me stupid .
hey , stupid .
what?
don't worry about it , man .
this is the part where eric rivers jumps up ... ... and angels descend from heaven , sustaining one long note ...
... and he says , " team meeting .
does he have a plan?
i bet he does .
this is our last shot .
it's over .
what?
wait , he's giving up?
what the hell else you want me to do?
i'm fricking one step away from being somebody's stalker .
you guys should have just stayed home , not listened to a word i said .
my fault .
let's get one thing straight here .
i followed you here because you got balls .
and because sandy's dad was about to rip mine off , but ....
seriously . lf it wasn't for you , we'd still be at home .
i'd still be on your couch .
don't push me !
hey , man , i'm trying to tell you we're having fun , bro .
for real , man .
we're on an adventure .
no .
no , we're on a train wreck .
this is a revolving nightmare .
no , a revolving nightmare is us still in chicago ... ... not trying to do anything with our lives .
let me tell you something .
the $ 736 . 1 8 i've spent since i've been here ... ... worth it .
you have that down to an exact?
yes , worth it .
every penny .
look at us , man .
we're not losers anymore , man .
we're a team .
we're super duper .
fucking assholes .
come on , don't be sad .
hey !
hey , what's going on?
you might want to stand back about 40 feet .
yeah , look , i'm a little ripe right now .
so listen , are you guys going up to santa monica?
no , we weren't going to .
what's going on there?
it's the pro jam . lf you're pro or sponsored , you can skate .
really?
i could try to help you guys out .
maybe go with you?
all right .
that would be great .
come here , team meeting .
excuse us .
what's up?
give me five seconds .
what?
ln the name of all things holy , please .
you feel this vibe?
you feel the pulse?
how we're all sharing one heartbeat , like a herd of elk?
we finally accumulated something of a team vibe over there .
do not ruin it .
you don't wanna bring a girl?
no , man !
where's the van , dude?
they're all cute , and ... ... the horns come out .
no !
rules are rules .
but where's the van?
where's our car?
maybe she has a car .
she's a good girl .
trust her .
she's sexy .

i'm right here .
i can hear you .
hi .
it's cool .
i mean , whatever .
just do your thing .
seriously , i don't want to interrupt your team vibe .
but you're not .
that's the thing .
no , i get it .
i totally i get it .
it's no big deal .
i hope i see you guys at the beach .
see you .
jamie , it's nothing personal .
it's just rules .
you are such a dumb ass .
i'm so hungry , one of my ribs is poking through the skin .
i would literally kill for a night in a real bed .
look who's got a nice , comfy suv?

i see .
i'm sorry .
no , we're sorry , son .
we're sorry we tried to push you through clown college .
sorry about a lot of other things .
there's more to life than a pie in the face for you , and we accept that .
i've been so pissed off at you for running off and getting into this whole clown thing .
but i think i get it now .
you guys are just trying to make yourselves happy .
there are things in life that just aren't that easy .
but the important thing is , you're out there trying .
