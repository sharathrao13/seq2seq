there's been another murder .
you remember i said my friend gave the brief to a friend at the fbl?
the fbl friend was killed yesterday .
how do you know?
i was holding his hand .
he was shot ... ... in broad daylight in a crowd .
i'm very sorry .
i'm in new york now .
when can you come?
you'll have to give me something i can confirm .
we get many calls from people claiming to know who killed rosenberg and jensen .
something you can confirm?
please .
such as?
the name of the friend that was murdered in the car explosion .
take your time .
callahan .
his first name?
thomas .
where did it happen?
in new orleans .
i think that should be enough .
all right .
what's the name of the friend that worked at the fbl?
verheek .
gavin verheek .
voyles 'chief counsel .
i think that's more than enough .
i'll be on a plane this afternoon .
you must follow my instructions .
this is gray grantham .
that's right .
got it .
did you follow my instructions?
you must think i'm crazy .
yes , i did ... ... till i checked new orleans .
callahan was ... ... killed exactly as you said .
i also check on verheek .
according to the fbl ... ... they found his body 2 days ago ... ... in a hotel room early in the morning .
he'd been dead for at least 8 hours .
that can't be .
want to talk about the brief?
everyone i've told about the brief is dead .
i'll take my chances .
you can't , under any circumstances , use my name ... ... or reveal how you got the information .
or publish anything until i've left the country .
agreed?
unless i can convince you otherwise .
you can't .
may i sit down?
mind if i use a tape recorder?
interesting read , isn't it?
what'd the president say?
he spoke to voyles ... ... who will leave it alone for a while .
the president asked voyles to back off?
we thought it was just another shot in the dark .
now i'm not sure .
that's obstruction of justice .
assuming the brief turns out to be true .
if it does , you'll be the fall guy .
i won't be the only one .
the old nixon two step .
don't even think that name .
look at the hopeful side , irangate , iraqgate ...
good chance it won't come out .
what's up with grantham?
we got his car phone .
we haven't been inside the home yet .
why not?
we almost got caught by the cleaning lady .
grantham knows about the brief .
he called 3 white house aides today ... ... and god knows who else .
what made you hone in on this particular case so quickly?
i remembered this piece that " frontline " did a year ago ... ... about the young lawyer who originally filed the suit .
they said he'd committed suicide , but his family thought it was foul play .
after the assassinations , i called his family .
they said he had a depressive problem years before ... ... but medication had taken care of it .
his doctor confirmed what the family said .
they told the police they were not convinced it was suicide .
but the police closed the investigation .
exactly .
that's it .
that's the brief .
maybe we could ... ... finish up in the morning?
i'll stay up and go over my notes ... ... while they're fresh in my head .
call me when you wake up .
try and get some sleep .
i know it sounds silly , but ... ... would you sleep on the sofa?
no problem .
good night .
listen ...
at the risk of sounding old fashioned ... ... isn't it time i knew your real name?
darby shaw .
what made you pick me , darby shaw?
callahan was a fan .
does the name victor mattiece mean anything to you?
money ... ... power ... ... influence ...
he's made and lost several fortunes drilling for oil in south louisiana .
in 1979 ... ... his oil company punched some holes in terrebonne parish and hit oil .
a lot of oil .
he needed governmental permission ... ... to dredge a channel though the marshlands to get the oil out .
enter mattiece , the great campaign contributor ... ... and as night follows day ... ... government permission to gouge through the endangered marshes .
mattiece is that close to at least a billion dollars ... ... when green fund ... ... an obscure environmental outfit ... ... trots down to the u. s. district court in lafayette and files a lawsuit ... ... to stop the entire operation .
of course , mattiece spares no expense to win the lawsuit .
i don't think there's a top law firm between houston and new orleans ... ... that he hasn't hired .
fucking pbs !
by the time the green fund lawyers ... ... all two of them ... ... wade in , the joint ventures ... ... limited partnerships and corporate associations ... ... form an impenetrable maze that makes mattiece invisible .
osprey , egrets , pelicans , ducks , cranes , geese .
the pelican becomes the hero .
after 30 years of contamination by ddt and other pesticides ... ... the louisiana brown pelican is on the brink of extinction .
green fund seizes the bird and enlists experts ... ... from around the country to testify on its behalf .
it takes 7 years for the pelican suit to go to trial in lake charles .
the 3 man jury , caring less about the pelicans than jobs ... ... votes in favor of mattiece .
but the judge rules to keep the injunction against drilling because ... ... he thinks green fund has proven its point about the pelican ... ... a federally protected species , and that it will appeal .
what's the lawsuit's status?
from the trial level ... ... it will be appealed to the court of appeals in new orleans in a month .
any idea what the court will do?
it could be reversed .
then the fun starts .
if either side is unhappy with the court ... ... they can appeal to the supreme court .
from today , how long would it take for a decision by the supreme court?
anywhere from 3 to 5 years .
rosenberg would have died .
but another president could be in the white house when he died .
so if you're mattiece ... ... and you don't mind killing a couple of supremes ... ... now's the time to kill them , when you can predict their replacement .
but why jensen?
protecting the environment .
i didn't mean to wake you .
you said that mattiece hired law firms from houston to new orleans .
were there any in washington?
maybe two .
white & blazevich ...
... and brim , stearns & somebody .
great !
i got a call from a lawyer in d. c ... ... who saw something concerning rosenberg and jensen .
he backed out of our meeting .
i never heard from him again .
he gave me a phony name , but i got his picture .
how?
long story .
if he works at one of these law firms , he could be our confirmation .
i hope you find him .
come with me to washington .
i've had enough .
if you're right about mattiece , then there'll be a cover up .
it'll probably work .
how do you know?
i called the herald morgue last night .
two years ago , a reporter did a piece ... ... on " violations of campaign financing laws .
he found out that , hidden under a lot of other names of individuals ... ... and pac's and corporations , mattiece was the biggest contributor ... ... by far ... ... to the president's campaign .
we ran a picture , with the article , of the president and mattiece .
it was taken unbeknownst to either one .
in it , the president and mattiece are in front of mattiece's hunting lodge ... ... sipping on some bourbon , having a good laugh .
the best of pals .
the president's most secret ...
... and generous contributor .
now , if your brief is right and it ever reaches the light of day ... ... the president loses any chance of reelection .
the men around the president won't let that happen .
i checked with my sources .
the bureau , langley , the white house ... ... all said the brief doesn't exist .
you may be the only witness to the fact there is a brief .
if you disappear ... ... so does justice .
is that what callahan would want?
he'd want me to see my 25th birthday .
if this thing reaches as deep and goes as high as we think it does ... ... they'll do anything not to be exposed .
where can you hide?
go back to washington .
they'll all shook up about you asking about something .
i expected that .
it's like the gestapo over there .
coal clears everything .
they put me on medical leave for 90 days .
what's wrong with you?
i don't know .
one thing i do know , i've never seen it this bad .
i'm worried about you , son .
gray , it's darby .
when you hear this , i'll be in the air on my way to nowhere .
try to understand .
i can't keep you on that story .
i'm sending you to arkansas .
the times , the networks ... ... are there checking out the judge they're about to nominate .
i need more time .
for what?
you lost your white house sources , you've lost garcia and the girl .
not your best week .
you can't take me off this story .
what do you know for fact?
an unidentified guy says he knows about the assassinations .
he works in a law firm ; you don't know which one .
he's cut off all contact .
that's not very promising .
there's something there , i can smell it .
evidence based on olfactory prowess is inadmissible , in case you didn't know .
then there's a girl ... ... with her bird brief for which you can't get confirmation .
yet .
she also cut off contact , something that's reaching epidemic proportions .
they're waiting for you upstairs .
everything she said about the two deaths has been confirmed .
the fbl says verheek was killed in some hotel mugging .
that's what you told me .
that's what they told me .
and they said they knew of no connection with the assassinations .
what else would they say?
i'm interested in what they did say .
let's look at what i have confirmed .
callahan was killed in a car explosion .
they had an affair .
give it to the times picayune .
maybe they want some gossip .
i also found that callahan clerked for rosenberg 20 years ago .
life is filled with odd coincidence .
not a coincidence if the brief
you have no confirmation there is a brief .
i confirmed verheek and callahan were friends .
they met here a few weeks ago , when he must have given him the brief .
supposition again .
i've confirmed the pelican lawsuit .
on which she has based her suppositions .
it's all just suppositions .
you know what mattiece could do?
i know what he has done already .
he has a bizarre history .
so do i , according to my ex wife .
it doesn't mean that i killed the justices .
but it means it's worth exploring .
go down to that crappy cabin of yours on the weekend , hole up , retrench .
prove you have a way to revitalize this story , and i might keep you on it .
but if i were you , i'd check where to eat in little rock .
this is the story of a mystery that may never be solved .
the story of a brilliant young lawyer who loved this land ... ... and wanted to fight to preserve it from the inroads of man ... ... until his abrupt death ... ... a few months ago .
his body was found in a lonely cottage , near the bayou he so loved .
there was a bullet in his head ... ... and a gun beside him .
the coroner and police have deemed it a suicide .
but he died sitting at a computer , surrounded by his notes ... ... for what he called the case he was born to win .
his friends and family ask ... ... would anyone commit suicide in such a manner ... ... at such a time?
tonight , frontline explores the death of a young idealist .
who's there?
it's darby !
i got your message .
if they bugged your phone , i wanted them to think i left the country .
did you find that lawyer in d. c.?
not yet .
my editor wants to take me off the story .
i could help you find him .
how'd you find me?
i called your editor .
he told you?
i told him i was your sister mary from out of town and couldn't find you .
how'd you know i had a sister mary?
you're not the only one doing research .
it was a beautiful service .
i'll have an announcement after the weekend .
it was the right thing to do , no matter where the body was found .
you can't announce the nominations next week .
you said they'd be vetted this weekend .
there must be a change in plans .
i don't understand .
the pelican brief .
what about the pelican brief?
i thought that was ancient history .
we believe that grantham's gotten a hold of it .
mattiece will sue the pants off them if they try to publish that .
not if it's true .
you think it's true?
a man who gave the president millions ...
... had two supreme court justices killed so his pal , the president ...
... could appoint more reasonable men to the bench ...
... so that his oil could be harvested .
if voyles says you told him to back off the case , we face an obstruction charge .
oh , jesus !
there's a way to handle this .
handle it how?
we appoint two nature lovers to the court .
good environmentalists who'd kill mattiece and his oil field .
meet with voyles , in the presence of the attorney general ... ... and demand an immediate investigation into mattiece .
i'll leak copies of the brief to every reporter in town .
then we ride out the storm .
but there has to be some way to keep this information from coming out .
i'm working on it .
what?
how?
mr. president ... ... you don't want to know .
what's this all about?
a trip to mt .
vernon will do you good .
are you losing it?
first i order you to go to little rock , you refuse to go .
you refuse to tell me why , then you order me ... ... your boss , i might add ... ... to drop everything and meet you at george's place .
i thought of making you unemployed ... ... but you'd sue me for discrimination .
she's here .
the bird girl?
she's here .
you could've told me .
not wise .
by the way , refusing to tell me where you could be reached ... ... didn't leave a good impression .
it's too risky to go to my apartment or to the job .
where have you been?
in a little hotel .
this is a hell of a time to punch notches in your belt .
we're not in the same hotel .
she's helping me find garcia .
it sounds like she's in control .
it's the only way she'd play .
so what if you can't find garcia?
we go to plan b.
what's that?
we attack the lawyers directly .
what if it's another firm?
we go to plan c.
what's that?
we didn't go that far .
what if you do?
i must be able to get in touch with you .
i'm at the marbury hotel , room 833 .
don't use my name .
write it down .
you mind getting off at the next exit?
why?
a tan car's been two cars behind us ... ... since we got on the parkway .
i thought it was following us .
right .
georgetown law school , please .
hurry .
meet me by the stacks .
someone was in my room .
did you tell anyone where you were?
smith keen , but he'd never repeat it .
did you tell him by phone?
we were ...
we were in his car .
georgetown law center .
placement office , please .
one moment , please .
placement office .
this is susan johnson .
i'm a partner with white & blazevich .
we're trying to reconstruct some payroll records .
may i have the names of your students that clerked here last summer?
i'm from white & blazevich .
you have something for me?
would you sign this , please?
thank you , mr. stevens .
you're welcome .
i'll call these 5 and see who's home .
i'll take the two with no phone number and get their class schedules .
see you later .
i'm gray grantham from the washington herald .
i'm looking for ...
...
robert akers and laura kaas .
is there a problem?
just a few questions i want to ask .
are they in class this morning?
one moment , please .
excuse me .
do you have i. d.?
could i speak to dennis maylor , please?
i'm keith maylor .
i'm sorry to bother you .
akers has criminal procedure .
kaas has administrative law .
i'll try to find them .
maylor , reinhart and wilson were all at home .
i can go to maylor's .
excuse me .
do you know laura kaas?
she's the girl with the red backpack .
do you recognize this man?
he's a lawyer at white & blazevich .
we're down to akers and linney .
linney's phone was disconnected .
i'll get his class schedule .
i'll keep looking for akers .
it's me again .
i need the class schedule for edward linney .
i'm sorry , mr. grantham .
one of the students you talked to called white & blazevich , who called the dean .
no more class schedules for reporters .
mr. grantham .
i know edward .
he's dropped out of school for a while .
personal problems .
where is he?
his parents put him in a private hospital .
he's being detoxified .
look , he's a good guy .
parklane hospital .
good afternoon .
i'm here to see edward linney .
what room is he in?
what's your name?
gray grantham , washington herald .
the law school said i could see him .
i'm sorry they did .
we run this hospital and they run their law school .
may i see your administrator?
i'll see if i can find him .
great architecture .
i'm sorry , mr. grantham .
visitation is only allowed on the weekend ... ... and then only family .
when will he be discharged?
i'm afraid that's confidential .
perhaps when his insurance expires?
do you recognize that man?
what's his name?
that's the point , i don't know .
what is his name?
he works in the oil and gas section on the 9th floor .
morgan .
morgan .
his first name's something like ... ... charles , but that's not it .
i can't tell you how grateful i am .
when you opened the door ... ... i thought i was hallucinating .
i'm sorry .
i'll take a hallucination like that ... ... anytime .
take care of yourself .
excuse me , miss .
what're you doing?
visiting my brother .
who is your brother?
edward linney .
this your sister?
leave her alone .
mom will come on the weekend .
sis?
come back soon .
i'll try .
i know you'd agree with me about the horrendous cost of health care .
of course , of course .
we pride ourselves on our enlightened policy regarding payment .
thank you very much for your time .
we'll be happy to have you back on any of our normal visiting days .
curtis morgan , oil and gas .
white & blazevich , please .
second floor .
use the escalator .
may i help you?
dorothy blythe , to see curtis morgan .
have a seat .
i'll be right with you .
you have a meeting with mr. morgan?
yes , at five .
when did you make the appointment?
2 weeks ago .
may i ask why?
obviously , i need an oil and gas lawyer .
curtis morgan is dead .
why didn't anyone call me?
we have no record of your appointment .
what happened?
he was mugged a week ago .
shot by street punks , we believe .
do you have some identification?
he's security .
security for what?
come with us , you should see someone else .
after this treatment , i have no interest in talking to anyone in this firm .
they killed him !
i can't breathe !
it's all right .
just let it go .
let it go .
it's all right .
we ran the story about a week ago .
it's just another mugging .
didn't make the metro front page .
curtis morgan ... ... 225 willow road , bethesda .
225 willow road ... ... bethesda .
that's what i wanted .
report in before noon tomorrow .
we're nervous over here .
you know ... ... good help is hard to find .
i'm going with you .
look at me .
i want you to leave .
and if you need confirmation for your story?
i'm on my own .
what's changed your mind?
i want you to reach 25 .
i'm coming .
this is anne .
good evening .
i'm grantham of the herald .
this is my assistant .
could we see mrs. morgan?
i'm her father .
she won't talk .
i respect her privacy .
i know she's been through an ordeal .
when did you people ever respect anyone's privacy?
i feel that way about most reporters .
but her husband called me ... ... three times before he died .
i don't believe his death was accidental .
she doesn't want to talk .
get the hell out of here .
you change your mind ... ... i'll be at this number .
this is mrs. morgan .
do you still want to see me?
did you know your husband called me?
how would he know anything about those dead judges?
i have no idea .
did he keep any ... ... unusual documents ... ... or papers?
we have a lock box at the bank for deeds and wills .
i looked at it last thursday .
there was nothing unusual in it .
on saturday morning ... ... i was going through his ... ... desk in the bedroom .
i found something a bit unusual .
a key .
a key to what?
another lock box .
which bank?
riggs bank .
we've never banked there .
and you knew nothing about this other ... ... box?
not until saturday morning .
i figured ... ... i'll run by when i felt up to it .
maybe you should check it , mrs. morgan .
could be a clue to who killed him .
are you saying curtis was killed ... ... because he knew something about these assassinations?
that's exactly what i'm saying .
do you think there may be papers in the safe deposit box ... ... that may reveal what curtis knew about the assassinations?
there could be .
my child's lost one parent .
i can't let her lose another .
i'll check it for you .
no one has to know you have the key .
they will only give it to his wife .
my partner's a woman .
she's trustworthy .
i would have one condition .
if you find something that disparages my husband in any way , you can't use it .
you have my word , mrs. morgan .
where are the safe deposit boxes?
down those steps .
i need access to a box , please .
the number , please?
616 .
this box was rented 2 weeks ago .
i assume you're mrs. morgan?
sara ann morgan .
the address?
225 willow road , bethesda .
phone number?
301 555 7128 .
who rented this box?
my husband , curtis d. morgan .
and his social security number?
510 96 8686 .
will you sign here , please?
may i help you?
i'd like to rent a box .
will you have a seat?
i'll be with you in a minute .
your key?
yes , i do .
follow me .
it's a four page affidavit ... ... signed under oath .
it's dated the day before the last time he called me .
he worked at white & blazevich in the oil and gas section for 5 years .
listen to this !
during that time ... ... he worked for a client who was engaged in a lawsuit in louisiana .
the client was a man named victor mattiece ... ... who he's never met .
lots about the lawsuit , how desperate mattiece was to win it .
just as if you wrote it .
a partner named sims wakefield ... ... supervised the case for w & b. morgan worked on a peripherated case .
he took files and documents that wakefield left for him ... ... not related to the case .
when he got back to his own office ... ... he found a handwritten memo on the bottom of the stack .
he'd inadvertently taken it from wakefield's desk .
a copy of the memo is attached to the affidavit .
he copied the memo and left the memo under the files on his desk .
next stop , washington herald !
stop !
get out of the car !
there was a car explosion in a garage near the riggs bank .
the police traced the car to a leasing agency .
it was rented yesterday by grantham .
have you heard from grantham?
not since yesterday .
i should've taken him off that story .
what story?
see what you can find .
smith keen ... ... meet darby shaw .
what the hell is going on?
sweetheart , i'm down here in the basement .
it's about two in the morning .
this is an affidavit ... ... concerning a memo i found on my desk .
i'm going to trust you to do with it what you will .
the memo's from velmano , he's a senior partner .
sims , advise client research is complete .
the bench will sit much softer if the old man is retired .
the second retirement is a bit unusual .
jensen , of all people .
advise further that the pelican should arrive here in 4 years ...
... assuming other factors .
there's no signature .
then justices rosenberg and jensen were killed .
i firmly believe that this is the work of mattiece and his associates .
memo doesn't mention mattiece , but it refers to a client .
wakefield had no other clients .
and no client had as much to gain from the new court .
i thought that i was protecting us by not revealing what i found .
you'll only see this if i'm gone , so i will have failed .
i'm sorry , sweetheart .
i'll always be with you .
always .
this is marty velmano .
what a pleasure !
what can i do for you?
we're doing a story about victor mattiece ... ... and his involvement in the deaths of rosenberg and jensen .
great !
we'll sue you for the next 20 years .
you'll be named as a defendant .
oh , this will be great .
victor mattiece will own the herald .
have you heard of the pelican brief?
we have a copy of it .
we also have a copy of a memo sent by you to sims wakefield ... ... in which you suggest your client's position would be greatly improved ... ... by the removal of rosenberg and jensen from the court .
i noticed you waited till five .
an hour earlier , we could've run to court , stopped this .
you deny you wrote the memo?
it's a fabrication .
you have no lawsuit , mr. velmano .
you know it .
you son of a bitch !
mr. coal?
have you read the pelican brief?
i have .
we're running a story which verifies the facts set forth in that brief .
we've confirmed mattiece contributed over $4 million ... ... to the president's last campaign .
4, 200, 000 , all through legal channels .
that's right .
we believe the white house tried to obstruct the fbl investigation ... ... and we wonder if there are any comments .
the white house denies any direct or indirect involvement ... ... in this investigation .
you've received some bad information .
mr. voyles , it's grantham .
we're running a story detailing a conspiracy ... ... in the murders of rosenberg and jensen .
we're naming mattiece , an oil speculator , and two of his lawyers .
we believe the fbl knew about mattiece ... ... but didn't investigate at the urging of the white house .
any comments?
i think we'll have great success with these people .
they were really very pleased ... ... and genuinely cooperative .
what's up?
you know gray grantham .
and this is darby shaw .
so you're the little lady who started this great brouhaha .
i think you have me confused with the president's friend .
i have some comments for the record .
first , we got the pelican brief two weeks ago ... ... and submitted it to the white house on the same day .
it was not considered high priority in the investigation until gavin verheek ... ... special counsel to the director , was found murdered .
did the white house interfere in the fbl investigation of mattiece?
i'll discuss it ... ... off the record .
last wednesday the president asked me to ignore victor mattiece as a suspect .
in his words ... ... he asked me to " back off .
i have a tape ... ... which i will allow no one to hear ... ... unless the president first denies this .
so what do you do now?
there'll be a grand jury by noon tomorrow .
quick indictments .
and we'll find mattiece .
i'd like a few minutes alone with ms. shaw .
if she doesn't mind .
it's her call .
i'd like mr. grantham to stay .
what's next for you?
who killed the man disguised as verheek?
oh , you mean the assassin , khamel .
off the record , khamel was killed by a contract operative ... ... hired independently by the cla .
rupert?
he probably has 20 names .
why was he following her?
i think the brief initially scared giminski more than anyone .
and he probably ... ... sent rupert ... ... to trail darby ... ... in part to watch and in part to protect .
we can help .
what do you want?
to leave the country , alone .
all right .
we'll get you out of this building , put you on my plane .
we'll fly you anywhere you want and you can disappear .
but you must allow me to contact you ... ... through mr. grantham ... ... if , and only if , it becomes urgently necessary .
that's fine .
i want no one on the plane but me , gray and the pilots .
after takeoff , i'll tell the pilot where to go .
he has to file a flight plan before he can leave .
you're the director of the fbl .
set it up .
our guest today is gray grantham ... ... who has , as just about everyone in america knows ... ... revealed the plot behind the assassinations of rosenberg and jensen .
the ripple effects of this story just don't seem to stop .
as of this broadcast , victor mattiece , one of the country's richest men ... ... has been indicted , along with 4 aides and lawyers .
fletcher coal , the president's chief of staff , has resigned .
and we're getting strong indications that the president himself ... ... will not run again .
that's what we know .
let's get to what we don't .
we know the pelican brief was written by a woman named darby shaw ... ... but we don't know who that is .
who is darby shaw?
that's a question for darby shaw .
that leads me to my next question .
speaking for many of our colleagues ... ... who are in a feeding frenzy to interview her ... ... where is darby shaw?
that's also a question for darby shaw .
but she's not available ... ... to answer questions until the feeding frenzy stops .
does that mean you don't know where she is?
i didn't say that .
then you do know .
i take it this cryptic smile means ... ... you're not answering .
in view of all this , you know that ... ... there's speculation ... ... that this woman is a figment of your imagination .
that you created her from a lot of different sources .
just as there are people who believe there was no deep throat ... ... there are those who believe there is no darby shaw .
in other words , she's just too good to be true .
she almost is .
