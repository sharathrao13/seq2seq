bannon county's death machine !
someone should tell him he just won the state championship .
i have a feeling he didn't get to play enough .
well , shouldn't you be sitting with him?
after a game , he says he needs to be with the guys .
you'd kill his post game bus high .
basically .
if they lose , it's a totally different thing .
can't pry him off me .
shit .
ok , everybody sit down .
sit tight .
son of a bitch !
what in the hell would you call that?
i don't know , but whatever it is ... it's sharp as a son of a bitch .
what in the hell are we looking at?
sharp enough to flatten a tire , whatever it is .
you know how thick that rubber is?
have to be shot into it like a bullet .
jesus christ !
the damn thing has got teeth in it !
they can't just whip the jack out and pump this mother up?
the driver can't change a flat on a bus .
they need a mechanic .
so?
so , do you see any mechanics around here?
you sucked so bad today , deaundre ... they're probably saying you gotta change the flat .
... where she'll give us the latest update ...
lzzy ! on a continuing story ... we call " the horror in poho county .
hey , poho update !
well , peter , the fire which gutted ... an old church south of pertwilla four days ago ... continues to offer up a gruesome bounty .
county sheriffs excavating the charred ruins ... say the body count is now up well past three hundred .
county coroners say the bodies were found ... stitched to each other ... covering the basement's walls and ceiling .
one on the scene witness called it ...
a human tapestry of torture and sadism " ... and " a sight he will never forget .
sheila , the details keep getting ... stranger and stranger every day this week , it seems .
any new information?
some of the corpses they have found ... had false teeth made out of wood .
that means some of the bodies they're finding down there ... are over two hundred years old .
but , peter , it's the condition of the cadavers ... that's the strangest fact of all .
the county coroner's office reported yesterday ... that they have yet to find any one complete body .
believe that , man?
no , they're making it up . ... missing an external limb or an internal organ .
what connection this has
this is 226 , out on east 9 .
we are down and disabled .
home base , do you read me?
you get a good look at the points on this thing?
it's either ivory or some kind of bone .

we gotta be in some kind of sun spot or something .
there's no signal getting out .
it's going to be dark in about an hour .

say again , this is 226 .
anyone read me?

hanna's got it in for me him and his little token white boy barnes .
i don't know ... maybe i got the wrong skin color to get equal play on this team .
i know you don't mean that .
maybe they just wanted to make sure ... everyone got a chance to play in the championship .
everyone's not the reason why we made it to the championship .
half the losers on this bus had nothing to do with ... us making it to state i did .

hey , guys !
betty's flare gun .
abunch offlaresforit, too !
who says we wait around?
i'm serious .
scotty , you're not talking about getting off this bus .
you see that?
that means that there's a farm ... down at the end of this road somewhere ... and that's as far as anybody'd have to get to .
with that thing out there?
scotty , with that thing out there?
scotty !
that thing hasn't been back here in almost an hour .
that doesn't mean it's not still up there somewhere .
and that doesn't mean that it is .
hey , this isn't about who can run the fastest , ok?
or being a pussy .
what is your problem?
you tell me , lzzy or isn't he?
check yourselves , both of you !
do i make you nervous?
thinking you're going to come onto me ... and every other swinging dick on this bus makes me nervous .
yeah , it makes you fucking stupid , too !
scotty , stop it !
stop it !
scotty , come on .
you get that hand off of me ... or we're gonna have one more missing person out here .
there's nothing about any of us on this bus ... that's more important than sticking together .
it's the only way we're going to get through this .
you want to play cock of the walk now , huh?
now's not the time for this shit , scotty .
big k , sit .
i'm serious .
you want to play cock of the walk , bro?

you want to call me something else , scotty?
'cause i don't think you get ...
i can see you thinking it whether you say it or not .
just stop it right now .
both of you , stop it !
you guys all worked together today to win a ball game .
now that something really serious happens ... you can't even be civil to each other?
you tell him , not me .
whatever your trip is , we ain't got time for this shit .
we should all be looking for ways ... we can defend ourselves until help gets here .
we have got to move this piece of shit !
on what , the rim?
can you drive this thing or not?
we wouldn't get two feet , man !
what do you want me to do?
what the hell does it want?
what the fuck?

i think he's gone , man .
i'm willing to bet money on it .
you willing to bet stepping off this bus?
because that's the real bet .
how long's it been?
it's gone .
it came , it did its thing , it went away .
it went away , but what the hell was it doing?
what do you think it was doing?
it was picking people out .
what?
it can smell something in people , in their fear something that helps it pick people out .
pick people out for what?
i don't understand how you would know that , sweetie .
a dead boy told me .
i think he was trying to warn me .
he was trying to warn all of us ... that this thing has been around for thousands of years ... and that nothing has been able to kill it .
this is a dream you had?
well , the boy was dead , so , yes ...
i am assuming that it was a dream , scotty .
you were waving pom poms at people this morning .
now all of a sudden you're a psychic hotline?
i don't know !
you want to explain it to me?
because i can't .
the boy was trying to warn us ... that by morning it has to go back into the earth .
oh , come on .
into the ground for twenty three more years .
and then what?
lives happily ever after?
huh?
why don't you clean out your bong , all right?
scotty , just listen to her .
it is coming back .
this is a dream she had , rhonda .
are you going to believe it?
and it doesn't matter if we're hiding on this bus ... or if we're hiding under our beds .
it'll find us the ones that it picked out .
minx , take it easy , ok?
the boy told me that ... it can smell in our fear who it wants ... and what from them ... it wants to eat .
hello .

we are trapped in a broken down school bus out on east 9 ... and something is going to kill us ... if we don't get help out here right away .

in kissel county .
are you the cops?
what's trying to kill you?
what are you talking about?
just tell me , are you the fucking cops?

i'm already on the 9 ... but it's a big highway and so is kissel county .
are there any landmarks near you?
are you close to anything?
yeah , i'm close to peeing in my fucking pants , man .
can you just please tell me that you're on the way?
i can't really judge the strength of your signal ... but it doesn't sound close .
what does that mean , man?
it means it's going to take me a while to get to you .
look , we kind of have a time critical situation here .
roger that .
and please tell me that you're coming with backup ... because if you're not the cops ... you got to promise me that you'll call them ... and you'll tell them that we're stuck out here .
i'll call them .
i'll call them right now ... but what you've got to do is hang on .

huh?
we're screwed , right?
yeah .

you were the only one it gave tongue action , man ...
and we all saw it .
scotty !
i don't understand what you're trying to do .
i'm trying to stay alive .
you're trying to split us up !
we have just dropped a notch on the fucking food chain , man .

i saw him , and you did , too .
he looked right at you and smiled .
and when you made jake take the lights off it ... he could've looked at you twice and licked his fucking lips ... but we don't know that .
so you keep your little blacklist .
'cause when he takes you out and i hope he does
i'm gonna be the one gettin 'as far away ... from your sorry ass as i can .
time to go " is right .
i'm gonna go find that farm .
