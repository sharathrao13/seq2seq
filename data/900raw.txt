carol , did i ever tell you why i married her?
yes , sam , you told me many , many
her father was very , very rich ... and very , very sick .
the doctors assured me he'd be dead any minute .
there wasn't a second to lose .
i rushed right out and married the boss's daughter .
he was so sick !
it was like the angel of death was sittin 'in the room with him , watchin 'the clock .
they pulled the plug on him .
he wheezed and shook for about an hour .
and then ... he stabilized .
that son of a bitch just got older and sicker .
and older and sicker !
and older and sicker !
more coffee , sir?
no !
i couldn't wait around any longer .
i went out and made my own fortune .
the old fart hung in there for 15 years !
finally died of natural causes .
i want the rest of that money !
his money , her money , it's my money !
i had to live with that squealing , corpulent little toad all these years !
god , i hate that woman !
i i i
i hate the way she licks stamps .
i hate her furniture .
and i hate that little sound she makes when she sleeps .
ohhh !
and that filthy , little shitbag dog of hers ...
muffy !
aren't you scared?
scared?
hell , no .
i'm lookin 'forward to it .
my only regret , carol , is that the plan isn't more violent .
don't you consider throwing a body off a cliff in the dead of night violent?
nah !
she'll be unconscious , knocked out from the chloroform .
i'm talkin 'about hands on involvement .
hands on?
ohh .
ohh !
oh ho !
i'm goin 'now .
i can't wait .
good luck .

it's just like that woman to screw this up .

aah !
do you think she's dead?

my husband does business with the mafia .
when they track you down , you , your entire family , everyone you ever knew ... will all get chain saw enemas and that's not all !
oh , my god !
i've been abducted by huey and duey .
an [ sniffing ]
jesus christ !
it smells like a toilet in here !
it's just the ammonia .
we scrubbed down here for hours on our hands and knees , for god's sake .
my husband worships the ground i walk on !
wait till he hears about this !
he will explo o ode !
bye bye , barbara .
in local news , a kidnapping today in bel air .
police tell us this woman , barbara stone , the wife of clothing tycoon , sam stone , was abducted earlier today from the couple's estate on bellagio drive .
preliminary sources indicated that mr. stone was contacted late this afternoon ... and that a ransom demand has been made .
police officials [ newscaster # 2 ]
... kill mrs. stone if demands were not met .
it's on every goddamn channel !
millionaire heiress , barbara stone , has been kidnapped ... from her bel air mansion .
what'd he do , hire a publicist?
i feel terrible .
do you feel as guilty as i do?
guilty?
are you kidding?
he takes our money , steals your idea , goes out and makes a million dollars , and you feel guilty?
i can't believe it !
how many times have we been over this?
oh , honey , not again .
let me remind you of something .
you are the spandex miniskirt king .
not him .
he is the spandex miniskirt thief .
he's the one who should feel guilty .
look at this .
do you remember this?
you cried for a week when you saw this .
look at the smile on that asshole .
i know he stole it , but she really didn't do anything .
she was his partner !
oh , damn it , sandy .
do you enjoy getting stepped on?
do you?
'cause i don't , and i don't feel guilty .
i take it back .
i do feel guilty .
i feel very guilty .
i trusted a sleazeball like sam stone ... with our life savings on a handshake deal , and then sat there and watched him take it all away from us .
but that's over .
we know better now .
from now on , we trust no one .
to hell with everybody else .
we've got to be ruthless .
think ruthless .
what if i can't think ruthless?
you've got to .
it's good for you .
it makes you strong .
what the hell's the sense of being a decent person when nobody else is?
let's be assholes and get rich !
oh , oh !
i'm crazy about you , you big galoot !
ooh , you were somethin 'today !
yeah , it just doesn't get any better than this .
mmm .
i'm gonna take a quick shower .
can you be ready by the time i get out?
ready?
you're getting ready for sam .
the video equipment , remember?
tonight's the night .
oh yeah , i knew that .
now , do you remember where i told you to go?
yeah .
the old deserted bridge near the hollywood sign .
that's right .
you wait for him there .
he'll be in some rented car .
he's afraid of getting blood on his sports car .
get in as close as you can .
it's important you get a good shot of his face .
if we can't recognize him , we can't blackmail him .
you get that videotape of sam finishing off his wife , and that man will give us anything we want ... for the rest of his life .
yeah , then we're off to haiti .
not haiti , tahiti !
i knew that .
the passports came today .
cool .
frank , glad you're here .
what have we got?
we found a chloroform soaked handkerchief stuffed way down in the garbage , and a tire print on the lawn , a good one .
i'm having the lab check it out .
and we found a few drops of blood in the kitchen .
where's mr. stone?
he's upstairs .
he seems pretty upset .
##
yes?
mr. stone , lieutenant bender and walters are here .
they'd like to start as soon as possible .
i'll be right there .
ow !
oh , oh !
hee hee hee .
i like to hear a woman make a lot of sound .
uh huh .
i'll scream my head off if you want to , honey .
it's your money .
my wife just lays there like a gunnysack .
oh , my god .
she isn't dead yet .
he's gonna kill her right here !
oh , oh .
i have no enemies , at least none that i know of .
i i'm a businessman .
i manufacture women's sportswear .
i think i've heard of you .
don't they call you the " spandex king "?
the " spandex miniskirt king .
you probably read one of the articles .
yeah , it was all his idea ... spandex miniskirts .
was there anybody here today when you came home?
servants?
maids?
it was the maid's day off .
did you notice anything out of the ordinary when you came home?
no , not that i can remember .
what time did you come home?
it's the dog !
she isn't properly house trained .
no , it's sweet .
the dog's a little diabetic .
i think it's wine ...
or  oh , i know what that must be .
i i closed a very important business deal ... this morning and when i came home ...
i opened a bottle of champagne and and as i was ... walking through the house , celebrating ,
i called to barbara to come and share the moment with me .
she never came .
those monsters !
earl !
it was horrible .
she wasn't drugged or anything .
what happened?
she screamed and screamed .
god , it took forever .
it must have lasted ... two minutes .
he kept stopping and starting .
she'd be at the brink of death and he'd stop ,
let her catch her breath then start into her again !
she'd scream louder and louder and then , when she finally died , he looked so satisfied i thought he was gonna light up a cigarette afterwards .
son of a bitch enjoyed it !
sam's just been on tv claiming she was kidnapped .
she wasn't kidnapped .
he killed her .
i saw it .
honey , i know .
it's just an alibi .
he just said that to throw the police off his trail .
you gonna watch that right now?
i think i should .
baby , you don't wanna see it .
it'll make you sick .
i think i can take it .
oh , no !
ooh !
i can't watch this .
he actually went through with it .
stay in here .
don't come out .
what?
sam's here !

i fed 'em a banquet of bullshit .
i threw 'em off by miles .
all i have to do now ... is just sit back and do nothing , except , of course , i have to show up at the fictitious ransom drop .

we can't be too careful with sam .
he's a very suspicious man .

i've got to see him one more time .

if i don't see him on his birthday , he'll be very , very suspicious .
he'll be expecting his usual present .

nice butt .

your dance card'll be filled every day .

you're very good at this .
you should write children's books .

##
see , that's what i've got , the dominator x 1 .
it's the best speaker they carry .
it's really pretty .
can i help you?
yeah , uh
hi .
hi .
candy's here to get a stereo , and i'm here to see she doesn't get ripped off .
don't worry , i'm not like the others .
how much did you want to spend? $800 . $500 .
okay , i think i have an idea what to show you .
let's start with speakers .
okay .
over here , we have a great speaker , sentry ev 1 .
consumer stereo has just rated this a best buy .
i have a pair myself .
yeah , uh , what do you think of this one?
the dominator x 1?
the dominator's a good marketing idea , but it's really not a good speaker .
we give it a 500 % markup , so we sell it at 50 % off , give the customer the illusion he's getting a deal , and we still make a bundle .
but it's so big and impressive !
size means very little .
bigger is not necessarily better .
i sound like dr. ruth .
you mean the dominator's like a , uh  well , the dominators are very popular with men who like to have bigger ... uh
equipment?
exactly !
all right , let's try this one .
knees bent down , hips tucked under .
we're gonna work on the waist .
we're gonna loosen it up .
take the arms left and right .
out , and reach as far as you can .
keep going .
okay , left .
this time hold it over to the left .
reach as far as you can .
reach the right arm up to it and take it out .
very slowly twist through the rib cage .
slowly lengthen , lift that right leg up and hold it .
aaah !
keep holding it .
great !
doesn't that feel good?
muffy?
oh , muffy?
muffy , meet adolph .
adolph , eat muffy !
bon appetit , adolph .
junk , garbage , garbage , junk .
what do we got here?
oh ho ho .
i thought you might find this interesting .
an anonymous friend " .
more !
hello .
carol , i got your tape .
what are you talking about?
the tape ... the videotape .
what makes you think it was me?
who else would send me something like this?
it's sam .
he's onto us .
how in the hell did you get this , carol?
a friend of mine took it .
it's terrific .
i know why you sent me this tape , honey .
and you know what i'm gonna do?
i'm gonna do the same damn thing with you .
and you , too , could scream your brains out because no one's gonna hear .
you are gonna be beggin 'me for mercy , whimpering .
oh , here she goes again .
listen to this .
this is my favorite part .
he's gonna kill me .
he's gonna torture me and kill me .
i can't stay here .
i'm gonna have to stay ... at your place .
##
don't worry , honey .
stay here as long as you want .
oh , shoot !
crockett and tubbs , they're floatin '.
i can't just sit here and wait for him ... to track me down and kill me .
we've got to get sam put in jail .
i want you to make another copy of that tape , and this one's for the police .
so , i guess it's just a matter of time before you're caught , right , honeybun?
barbara , i want to ask you a personal question .
you and mr. stone , did you get along?
so , what did she say?
she just insulted me .
i don't think he loves her .
let's face it , she's not mother teresa .
gandhi would have strangled her .
what are we gonna do , kenny?
i'm tired of being scared all the time every day .
i can't take this anymore .
i know he's bluffing .
i just know it .
i've got to be really tough with him .
never let the seller know you're hot to trot .
tell him you haven't got the money .
hello .
debbie?
yeah , debbie's here .
who's this?
well , ralph , debbie can't talk right now .
my dick's in her mouth .
how 'bout if i have her call you back when i'm done .
i love wrong numbers .
anyway , tell 'em you don't have the money , that it's all tied up in investments or some crap .
hang on !
a bad salesman will automatically drop his price .
bad salesmen make me sick .
hello .
mr. stone , do you love your wife?
hang on .
would you excuse me for a moment , please?
oh , sure , mr. stone .
go ahead .
mr. stone , you love your wife , don't you?
sure , i love my wife .
mr. stone , we demand a satisfactory explanation ... why you haven't shown with the money .
look , pal , you're asking a lot of cash .
i haven't got that kind of money around the house .
it's all tied up in investments , so , uh , sorry .
sorry?
what do you mean , sorry?
no can do .
what?
no deal .
you have to take your business elsewhere .
what?
no " cash ola " .
uh , wh wh what about , uh ... less?
you make me sick .
make me an offer .
uh , bring

thursday .
tomorrow's thursday .
you mean , tomorrow?
yes , tomorrow !
bring 50, 000 tomorrow !
and if i don't?
then the next time you see your wife , pal , will be in the morgue .
mr. stone , i have bad news .
we think we've found your wife .
we'll need you to come with us to identify the body .
that's not her .
there must be some mistake .
we want the woman who was brought in this morning .
oh , jane doe 56?
she's in the next room .
it looks like her , a lot like her .
but it's not her .
my barbara !
she's alive !

may we have a word with you , please?
oh , sure .

we can talk in the salesmen's office .

thank you .
mr. kessler , over a week ago ... a lady named barbara stone was kidnapped from her bel air home .
are you familiar with the case?
yeah , i read about it .
we believe the vehicle the kidnappers used left a tire print in her driveway .
we took a mold of that print , had our lab analyze it , and the results were rather interesting .
these are the prints of the kidnapper's car , and these are the prints of your car .
is there a phone i can use?
uh , sure , it's right over there on the desk .
amazing similarity !
would you excuse me for a second?
i've got to go to the bathroom .
i've got a touch of the stomach flu .
sure , go right ahead .
chloroform?
what about fingerprints?
bingo !
we have a winner .
you won't believe this .
they found evidence implicating stone .
stone?
you're kidding?
chloroform and fingerprints .
i'll be damned .
let's get out of here .
where's kessler?
in the john .
stomach flu .
mr. kessler?
i'll b be right out .
don't bother , sir .
thank you for your help .
we'll just show ourselves out .
hello .
all right , mr. stone .
we came very close to killing your wife , but she begged us repeatedly for just one more chance .
so in the spirit of compassion and mercy , we decided not to kill her just yet .
compassion and mercy?
what the hell's going on over there?
i thought you people were ruthless !
we are , mr. stone .
then what's this phone call about?
we called to make you an offer ,
an offer even you can't refuse .
oh?
yeah .
10, 000 .
fat chance !
mr. stone , this is no joke !
we're desperate people .
i believe this is a joke , pal , and you're it .
the last time we spoke , you said my wife would be ... in the morgue if i didn't pay .
well , i didn't pay and today i was at the morgue .
she wasn't there .
you lied to me .
you know what i think of you?
no .
you got no nuts !
what do i have to do?
put a gun in your hand , aim , and pull your finger down , you spineless wimp?
i dare you to kill her !
now that oughta do it .
hey , you?
wanna sell me a stereo?
yeah , i'll sell you a stereo .
all right .
i'm lookin 'for something real hot .
i don't wanna get ripped off , you know?
okay .
you're looking for some real hot speakers , right?
i'm not talking about something you just listen to .
i'm talking about the kind of sound you can feel .
yeah !
you know what i mean .
yeah !
when it comes to great stereo , you can't beat big speakers .
i'm talking about big speakers with big woofers like this .
you can get this .
it has a nice little eight inch woofer , or this ten incher .
over here we have a nice big 12 inch .
but i can tell by the look on your face , man , you want something even bigger .
fuck , yeah !
" fuck , yeah " is right .
we gotta go to the big room for this !
the big room !
check it out , my man .
the flagship of the entire dominator line .
the mx 10 .
i have a pair of these myself .
30 inches of thigh slappin ', blood pumpin 'nuclear brain damage !
bitchin '!
hey , what's the fucking cost?
that's the bitchin 'part about it .
it don't matter .
if you can't afford it , fuckin 'finance it !
## [ loud hard rock ]
yeah !
whoo !
so what if it's as big as a subaru and costs as much !
you'll never have to trade this in .
this is gonna be with you for the rest of your life .
and when you die , they can bury you in it !
i want it !
this guy is okay .
first guy i feel i can really trust .
wait a minute .
why don't i show you something else?
they're not very big , but consumer stereo rates them a best buy .
the sentry ev 1s .
and they're not gonna break you .
kick it out .
two more .
that's it !
whew , i'm pooped .
let's take a break .
take a break?
come on , you little wimp !
let's go !
here's your lunch .
it's fruit salad .
you seem to like that the most , although you still don't eat as much as you should .
my body's become a more efficient machine .
i go farther with less food .
you must be in pretty good shape by now .
you certainly look good .
you've lost a lot of weight .
huh?
what?
oh , yeah , you've lost a lot of weight , at least 20 pounds .
what?
tw
do you have a scale?
i don't know how to thank you !
thank me?
i've been to ... ten different fat farms in ,
god , i don't know how many years .
and i lost a total , a total of six pounds .
i have lost 20 pounds !
i wasn't sure , but ... it felt thin .
you wouldn't have a never mind .
a a what?
no , no , no .
it's very silly .
no , what?
please tell me .
all my life i wanted to have a slinky little figure ... so i could wear some bill blass or valentino , some exotic evening gown like christian dior , jerry galanos .
are you kidding me?
you're kidding me , aren't you?
i'm sorry .
i know it's ridiculous to think that somebody of your ,
well , moderate means  i'll be right back .
just don't go anywhere .
sam stone?
yeah?
mr. stone , you're under arrest .
for mixing cotton with silk?
this is absolutely beautiful !
whose design is this?
is this bill blass?
albert nipon?
nah , too conventional .
halston?
i know who did it .
oscar de la renta .
i designed it .
get outta here !
really?
wow !
you're a professional .
nah .
you are !
this is sensational .
do you have any more?
wait !
# i won't do you no harm no #
# you've got to be all mine all mine #
# ooh , foxy lady #
# foxy #
so , sam told you i was his partner?
no way !
he was just passing the buck .
oh , god .
so , when do i get out of here?
as soon as mr. stone pays the ransom .
what's the problem?
what is the ransom?
it , it was $500, 000 .
that shouldn't be a problem .
he complained .
he complained?
and then we dropped our price to $50, 000 .
yeah?
he didn't pay .
he didn't pay?
so now what?
so now ... we're dropping our price again to $10, 000 .
do i understand this correctly?
i'm being marked down?
what is this?
the bargain basement?
i've been kidnapped by kmart !
don't cry , barbara .
hey , check it out .
you sure got a pretty mouth .
all right , stone , let's go .
hey , was it something i said?
yeah .
although this is a capital crime , the accused is an upstanding member of the community , a responsible and successful businessman ... and has never before posed a threat to society .
bail will be granted and set at ...
$700, 000 .
you want to try for a reduction?
no , pay the ticket and let's get the hell out of here .
that filthy slug !
that screeching little witch !
that pasty faced troll !
the judge?
my wife !
i gotta get her back !
sandy?
kenny?
it's over .
sam isn't going to pay the ransom .
he couldn't care less .
i'm no criminal .
i can't even sell retail ... and that's legal .
we gotta get packing and get outta here .
oh , kenny !
i've got some very interesting news for you .
i am the new rising star ...
in high fashion !
let's get a grip on ourselves .
try to be calm .
we're going down to mexico for a couple of years .
we can camp on the beach .
does that mean we let barbara go?
we're not going to take her with us .
good .
'cause i've already let her go .
what?
you let her go?
oh , my god !
you didn't let her just run right out of here?
yeah !
oh , my god !
why not?
she knows where we live .
she'll turn us in .
the police will be here .
you don't understand .
she really likes us now .
i showed her my gowns .
she loves them .
we're all going into business together .
we're gonna open our fall line in paris .
she told you this?
yes .
she really , truly loves me .
she can be trusted .
she's changed !
changed?
what'd you do?
perform an exorcism?
ken , she lost nearly 20 pounds .
well , you just had to be there .
it was a very special moment .
i'm surprised they knocked .
good afternoon .
we're wondering if you've seen this man .
he was sighted in the area a few weeks ago and then again this morning .
he's psychotic , extremely dangerous and violent .
he's killed half a dozen people .
i gotta get outta here .
my wife , she's late for work .
doesn't look familiar .
keep this and give us a call at this number in case you do see him .
under no circumstances should you try to subdue him yourself .
he's extremely violent .
he looks it .
thank you very much , officer .
sandy?
it's okay .
it's okay !
they're looking for somebody else .
i'll get the other suitcase from the basement .
hello?
hello?
anybody home?
oh , hello .
are you a friend of ken and sandy's?
you ...
look like my mother .
i hate my mother .
no .
you you look just like my father .
i hate my father !
jesus .
what the hell was that?
honey , don't touch him .
oh , my god .
it's the bedroom killer .
he told me i look like his mother .
he hates his mother .
he's dead .
so , if i look like his mother ... and you look like his father , this is what our son would look like .
pretty strong argument for birth control .
what do we do now?
barbara , what are you doing here?
i got it !
i tell you , i've got it .
listen to this .
all right .
sam arrives on a motorcycle wearing shorts , no shoes , no shirt , nothing .
maybe we'll just put him in a jockstrap .
we send him all over town in the middle of a hot , sunny day .
sam burns real easily .
he'll be bright red .
i can't believe this is happening .
then he's got to cover himself with honey and go to a bee farm .
we make him dance so the bees go absolutely nuts !
i don't think she really
then we all watch while they sting him to death !
yeah !
don't we want a punishment that'll keep stinging him the rest of his life?
my god , he must've been seeing this woman for years .
castrate him !
i want to castrate him .
wouldn't it be better if we struck at the core of sam's being ,
his reason for living?
what would that be?
his testicles !
would you know in complete detail what sam's total net worth would be , not just the big stuff , the little stuff too , down to the last penny?
yeah ...
i think so .
good .
i want you to write it down in as much detail as you can .
fire up the stove .
get the tofu burgers from the freezer .
we're calling sam .
my tux , my silk tux .
et tu , adolph?
et tu?
hello?
hi , sam .
oh , thank god it's you !
i've been thinking about your last offer .
i think you're right .
i cannot refuse . $10, 000 is fair and totally acceptable .
she's in bad shape , sam .
we've been torturing her .
aaah !
aaah !
don't kill her !
we found out your wife is worth quite a bit more than $10, 000 .
what do you mean?
we changed our minds .
we've upped the ransom .
to what?
we're up to $2 million . $2 million?
you outta your fucking mind?
where'd you get an incredible figure like that?
oh , you'd be surprised at the quality and quantity ... of information a lit cigarette can provide .
what else?
shh !
gems !
he's got rare gems in the safe .
oh , sam , forgive me .
what kind of gems?
how many?
i don't know .
aaah !
aaah !
four flawless one karat diamonds !
the bitch blabbed .
apparently , you got a million two built up in equity on sam's sportswear , another 350, 000 in your pension plan .
general dynamics closed at 75 and 3/ 4 today , which brings another 175, 000 to the party .
45, 000 for the excalibur and now there's the four one karat diamonds in the safe .
you inhuman slime !
after his release yesterday ,
mr. stone continued to deny the charges ... despite what the district attorney's office insists is overwhelming evidence .
overwhelming evidence is right !
what more do they want?
how could they let him go?
hello?
hello .
it's me again .
i see sam stone's been released .
it's not easy keeping a man in jail with these liberal courts .
a man is innocent until proven guilty .
well , how do you think these courts would feel ...
if i gave that tape to the media?
oh , my ...
god .
yeah !
they'd go crazy for it .
they love to show sick stuff like that .
it'd probably be on national tv 24 hours a day for weeks !
i bet that'd get a hell of a reaction .
please , please don't do that .
where's your sense of compassion?
why do you have to be so vicious?
vicious?
have you seen that tape?
come on !
what's the big deal?
it's just a lonely man who wanted a little excitement .
that kind of thing happens every day .
everybody does it !
i don't believe this .
i don't believe you said that !
men get the urge .
we're only human .
you're sick .
hello?
no , don't hang up on me !
so , what'd he say?
something strange is happening here .
either the chief is a complete moron , and complete morons are rare , or he's playing games with me .
we better find someplace where we can look at that tape .
this is perfect .
it is?
give me the tape .
okay .
ho , ho ho !
you idiot !
this isn't sam .
and he isn't killing her .
that's my husband !
barbara really was kidnapped .
she really was kidnapped !
i didn't kill her .
please believe me .
you gotta be there .
they're coming this time for sure .
i think the deli's using a different mustard .
the last time it was tangier .
jesus christ !
i'm pleading for my life ... and you're discussing the inconsistency of lunch meat condiments !
haven't you heard a word i've said?
god !
i'm sorry , mr. stone , but since the house is in your wife's name , as well as her other 15 million in assets , you're not legally entitled to it as long as your wife is alive .
however , you've got a million two built up in equity in your business , another 350, 000 in your pension plan .
you'd have no problem using that as collateral .
all right .
let's do it !
hello?
sam?
carol !
where the hell have you been?
i've called you 100 times .
sam , i miss you .
how have you been?
i'm going crazy over this kidnapping thing .
and the cops won't do a damn thing to help me .
why?
they don't believe me .
they think i made up the kidnapping .
they won't even show up at the ransom drop to see if i'm telling the truth !
you're gonna be all by yourself?
that's terrible .
how much money is it? $2 . 2 million .
cash?
of course it's cash .
have you ever heard of a kidnapper taking a check?
where are you going to give them the money?
i mean , i , i hope it isn't dangerous .
i've gotta go to a phone booth ... on hope street plaza .
hello?
sam !
it's so nice to hear your voice .
how's muffy?
listen , sam , we don't have much time .
there's a gun pointed at my head .
they're making me give the ransom instructions in case the police are listening .
you must make sure there are no police , otherwise they'll kill me .
nope .
no cops .
now , have you got all the money? $2 . 2 million in unmarked , nonsequential bills?
you miserable scum sucking pig !
oh , honey , i'm so sorry .
they made me say that .
yeah , i got all the money .
it's there in the briefcase?
you scumbag !
you lowlife motherfucker !
oh dear .
they made me say that too .
it's in the case , yeah .
the rolex too?
the gold rolex?
who said anything about the rolex?
they never mentioned the rolex .
they want the rolex and your pinkie ring !
honey , they tortured me with cigars .
i had to tell them everything .
all right .
what else?
that's it !
just wait there .
bag , please .
come on , give me the bag !
freeze !
put the bag down and put your hands on your head .
bender !
they're from the government .
they're here to help you .
i said no police .
do you know what this means?
stay back .
they touch me and i give the order to kill !
got it?
leave me alone or she's a dead woman .
you want her blood on your hands?
what do you think?
let's just follow him home .
okay , let him go .
what?
what are you doing?
gimme it !
let go .
tell him to let go .
if he doesn't let go i give the order .
go ahead , give the order .
let go !
she's a dead woman if he doesn't !
all right , drop it .
punk .
hello?
hello?
this is lt. bender .
what are you doing?
i'm taking my money .
you got your man .
the rest is your problem .
mr. stone , you may be guilty of obstructing justice , aiding and abetting a felon , accomplice to kidnapping and possibly murder .
my advice to you is to drop the gun , give back the bag .
we have 150 officers , 75 cars and two helicopters .
he won't get away .
that's better .
here !
what are you doing here?
tell them to get out of here !
if they don't go , she's dead !
all right , gentlemen , clear the street , please .
you too , mr. stone .
back away .
that's better .
you can go now .
don't follow me .
understand?
we understand .
don't move !
who the hell are you?
what the hell is going on?
i'm robbing you !
stop him !
did you shoot at me?
no , you moron .
there's police all over .
hundreds of 'em !
do i look that stupid?
yes , you do !
if you shot at me , where's your gun?
well , you're too sharp for me !
you got me figured out .
i don't have one .
that was a brand new tire .
give me your keys .
i don't believe this !
give the bag to bozo , drop the gun and put your hands in the air .
who said that?
this could very well be the stupidest person on the face of the earth .
perhaps we should shoot him .
it's the police department .
really?
no !
we're the national rifle association !
christ !
i'm leaving now .
they said they wouldn't follow me .
# hey #
# stand up #
# ruthless people #
# watch yourself #
# hey #
# stand up #
# ruthless people #
# ruthless people #
# you can have it if you want it #
# it might take the rest of your life #
# if you want it you can have it #
# ruthless people # they're still following me .
i should have known .
i knew this wouldn't work .
you can't trust the police !
oh , god .
oh ... boy .
he's cornered and he knows it .
i hope he doesn't hurt anybody .
i'm not going to jail !
i'm not going to jail !
oh , my god !
hey , look out !
watch it !
somebody help !
he'll drown !
the water's way too cold .
there's riptides .
i've seen sharks .
somebody call an ambulance .
look there !
that's money !
my money !
let's get the coast guard and fish him out .
you can't do that !
that's not your money !
that's my money !
stop 'em !
aaah !
the bedroom killer !
what about the money?
they recovered a few thousand dollars .
the rest washed away .
he said if anything went wrong , they'd kill barbara .
things couldn't have gone more wrong than this , could they?
that means she's dead .
mrs. stone !
i'll be damned !
mrs. stone?
yes .
i'm lt. walters .
we're glad to see you're okay .
i'm sorry to have to ask you to do this right now , but i'm afraid we need you to identify the body .
yes !
that's him !
oh , i could never forget that face .
what hell he put me through .
you're sure he worked alone?
positive .
he mentioned a partner .
he was schizophrenic .
he thought he had partners .
where's sam?
he's over there , mrs. stone .
would you excuse me for a moment?
i'd just like to be alone with my husband .
certainly .
thank you .
hello , sam .
barbara !
you look terrific !
you think so?
i mean ,
you're so thin .
really?
does it show?
i mean , you're beautiful !
oh , sam !
oh , barbara !
i hope my marriage is as strong as theirs after 15 years .
i can't believe we doubted stone's affection for his wife .
we almost blew it .
thank god she's alive .
ol 'buddy , you work , you put in long hours .
it's a tough beat .
but it all seems worth it when you get a moment like this .
yeah , i love a happy ending .
barbara !
