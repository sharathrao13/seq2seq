don't take one before they're done .
shit !
relax !
there are only three small ones for each .
you know that .
now you've mixed them .
that's not very bright .
hi , bjarne .
this is beate .
she's a teacher at tina's school .
i thought it would only be us .
she just dropped by .
come on over and sit down , bjarne .
bjarne is shy .
i know what that's like .
so opening your own shop , huh?
it's a big challenge .
svend is really bad with problems .
what?
i am too .
what do you mean?
when you don't get attention ...
then what?
what?
whatever .
and why shouldn't it work?
if holger can succeed , so can we .
he has his deersausage .
you say " sausage " all the time .
what do you have?
my marinade .
give bjarne a steak .
isn't it tough to be a butcher?
isn't it a mess of blood and stuff?
no .
it must be exciting too .
how many pigs could you slaughter in one day?
1, 100 .
1, 100?
have you always wanted to be a butcher?
it must be lonely in that kitchen with all that blood and ...
what are you doing?
did you just kick me?
shit !
what the fuck are you doing?
why did you invite me?
you need professional help .
i'm not up for that shit .
you don't have to kick her .
that's just your version .
... and also two deersausages .
they are absolutely marvelous .
what is your secret , if i may ask?
it's a long story .
i've always been fascinated by sausages .
it's almost mythological to kill an animal
and then mock it by sticking it in its own intestine .
can you image anything worse than being stuck up your own ass?
no , i don't think so .
that's one of our small pleasures .
he's doing it again .
no , no , no ...
look ...
he's doing it again .
you can't run a business like that .
i don't get why people come back .
they want the sausage .
don't say sausage all the time .
i can make a sausage way better that this bunch of junk .
what did you say , asshole?
nothing .
delusions of grandeur , huh?
svend is just talking .
it's nothing .
you are an embarresment to me .
what do you mean by that?
i can't sell bjarne's pate .
it tastes like jockstrap
and your marinade and meatballs aren't flying over the counter .
my marinade may need some work , but don't disparage my meatballs .
they are so fucking tough that you could blow them up like balloons .
let me stand behind the counter .
why should we be hidden away?
you'll never stand behind the counter , and do you know why?
because you sweat , and you're too disgusting .
this isn't working .
can't you see it?
we need to open our own shop .
svend , you have sausage on your head again .
hello again .
hello .
this is my partner bjarne .
hello .
just call me house hans .
you can just ponder why for a moment .
yeees ...
isn't it because you sell houses?
yes .
yes ...
bjarne , come on out here and have look .
there you have it .
look here .
here we have a bone crusher .
look at these tiles .
they're almost intact .
come on .
we just need a bit of beef here , some pig there and some chickens here .
svend , relax .
what do you say?
it's fine , but it's a lot of money .
what do you mean?
two million is a lot of money .
that's a strange number to throw around .
he said one million each .
yes , and that makes two million .
i don't want to discuss that .
i'm planning to mortgage my house all the way .
i don't have a house .
what am i supposed to do?
then it just stops here .
what do you want me to do?
fjeldsted sanatorlum
sanatorlum
if we had known you were coming , we would have cut his hair .
it's okay .
the resemblance is uncanny .
it is with many twins i think it's pretty common .
yes , so ...
he's in here .
you've never been here before , have you?
no .
i haven't seen him for seven years .
he'll never wake up again , will he?
no .
he's completely brain dead .
then turn him off .
why , all of a sudden?
it's the best decision .
his organs will benefit others .
but you never answered our letters .
i don't open all my mail .
i wrote you a letter every month .
really?
can't you just turn it off?
of course .
but may i ask ...
i need money .
he has one million from our parents that i'll get as his only heir .
when he's just lying there ...
of course .
it's best for everybody .
fine .
what was he like?
when you look at someone each day , you wonder what they were like .
no .
it's crooked again .
are you really unable to see that?
give me a break .
it looks fine .
fine?
is fine okay?
i don't think so .
let me tell you , you can't drink 19 beers
and then judge whether something is straight .
it's nice and straight now , huh?
it looks fine .
now it's okay .
secure it properly .
exactly .
just like that .
don't we need light in here?
yes , when we find an electrician .
what happened to the one we had?
i fired him .
he was yakking constantly , and that doesn't fix the light .
come .
please close the door .
our business cards have arrived .
they're just right .
with gold print and everything .
just hand them out to people you meet .
who am i going to meet?
you'll sort it out .
i bought 5, 000 , so just get busy .
hi .
hello .
isn't it nice?
i've cleaned up a bit .
oh ...
people come on the anniversary .
i noticed that it was seven years ago today .
you don't come here often?
no .
it's my first time .
i thought that they were down there .
is it your parents?
yes .
and your sister?
no .
she was my wife .
oh , okay .
was it a car accident?
how did you know?
it almost always is when they've died on the same day .
i don't want to disturb you .
i always ask too many questions .
it's okay .
thank you fortidying up .
you're welcome .
excuse me .
do you want to open a butcher shop with me?
what?
we're opening a shop tomorrow .
and ...
let me give you a card .
we've had these cards made .
oops ...
oh , well ...
i have to give them to people .
do you want to come?
astrid , are you coming or what?
we don't have all day .
no , sorry .
i can't come .
oh ...
i've got two cremations tomorrow .
i know what that's like .
what was that?
what did you just do with that meatball?
if we eat them all , there won't be any for the customers .
i shouldn't have to waste half my opening hours telling you that .
and what is that?
napkins for the customers .
no , it certainly isn't !
it will ruin the entire presentation .
could you just glance at the color of the counter?
it's green , isn't it?
and the balloons?
they're green .
stop it , svend !
or i'll leave and there won't be any fucking wedding .
i'm not keeping any people away .
excuse me .
we've been playing for two hours .
the drum has a ferry to catch ...
is that so?
then just get the fuck out of here .
take your fucking music and get lost .
fuck off with your shitty music .
you can't treat them like that .
oh yes , i can .
you're an asshole .
relax .
it isn't svend's fault that you bought the wrong napkins .
that's what i've been saying , but you don't listen to me , tina .
i had a point , didn't i?
and then you just run out .
i had a point , didn't i?
what am i doing wrong?
i thought i did everything right .
we have offers and decorations .
why don't we have any customers?
i have to take a dump .
yes , do that .
it's damn cold in there .
it's a meat locker .
i'll just get my coat .
it's going to take some time .
the wiring is a mess .
taste this marinade .
no .
smell this marinade .
smell this marinade .
it smells good , doesn't it?
i smoke 20 joints a day .
i wouldn't be able to smell it if my hair was on fire .
are you just going to sit there?
how about doing something productive?
have you given out your card?
yes .
yes?
how many?
i don't know .
a few .
go on in , svend .
promise you'll be there tonight .
no , i won't be .
go on .
it's absurd to break up now .
i'm on the verge of breaking through to an enormous number of customers .
it's barbecue season .
it's no time to break up .
people want steaks and ...
don't talk about steaks !
why do you say that?
i haven't mentioned steaks .
this isn't about steaks or other meat dishes .
we're just not right for each other .
you're just like everybody else .
you don't like me either .
i lost my parents , when i was very young .
enough with the parents .
i'll make sure to get my stuff out before you come home .
if you really feel like that , then why haven't you left?
why are you still sitting here?
just get out of the car .
don't count on seeing me tonight .
no .
i'll get out of the car .
but i know you .
you can't manage without the sweet life .
just sit there and be a martyr .
let's see you drive off , or is it just empty threats?
leave , tina .
leave .
holger ...
so this is where you live .
no expense spared , huh?
i'll just force my way through this swarm of well paying customers .
we're not open .
bjarne isn't here yet .
we don't open until he's here .
stop it , svend .
so how is business?
do you have many customers?
yes , i think so .
great .
then you don't have to stand there sweating like a pig .
please leave , holger .
i would like that .
it's my right to be here .
i need to buy something .
no , you don't .
please leave .
show me what you can do .
the rotary board of directors are coming to dinner at my house .
we'll be 12 plus me .
can you manage that
or is this just mahogany and gleaming tiles?
svend sweat .
hello?
what?
fuck !
shit !
there , there .
let's pull ourselves together .
yes .
it was an accident .
we'll just have to report it .
this isn't good .
this isn't good at all .
listen , we'll just tell it like it is .
it'll be okay .
it'll be okay .
there should be a handle on the inside .
this isn't good .
where is his leg?
i don't know .
listen to me .
why does he have one leg missing?
it was because holger came .
tina has left me , because she says that i talk too much about steaks .
what have you done?
i panicked .
holger provoked me .
and what did you do?
i cut 13 fillets of his thigh and put them in marinade .
rotary were coming for a barbecue .
are you insane?
are you completely insane?
i panicked , okay?
done is done .
can't we still report it?
it was an accident .
i didn't mean to kill him .
you just sold his thigh , dumbass .
you may have killed him by accident , but then you chose to carve him up .
it's over .
we're through , svend .
i know .
i shouldn't have done that last part .
i'm sorry .
what do we do now?
what do we do with him?
i don't know .
throw him in the bone crusher .
nobody knows he was here .
what?
he did the work off the books .
do you want to use the bone crusher?
no , i'm trying to help .
you think of something then .
what about holger's guests?
what should we tell them?
okay .
put him in the bone crusher .
let him hang until he's frozen , otherwise it'll be too disgusting .
i'm glad you came .
they're crazy .
what's happening?
holger had his dinner last night , and now everybody wants more .
they heard about it last night .
about what?
the fillets .
they love them .
what are you doing now?
i don't want to disappoint them , so i'm selling a bit more ofhim .
i'll kill you .
stop it !
it doesn't matter whether we use the bone crusher or sell him .
it's the best way to get rid ofhim .
you said it yourself .
i never said that .
let's say you didn't .
they want this .
we're not forcing them .
i don't have time forthis .
has tina left?
yes .
why should she stay when i have left her?
can't you see that you need help?
that may be the case .
can't you?
yes .
i don't know what i'm doing .
i don't know what i was thinking .
he was hanging there , and i just wanted him gone .
i didn't care how .
pull yourself together .
pull yourself together .
how?
he's out there in pieces .
he's out there , in the meat locker and on the table .
it's a mess .
i'm going home now no .
svend , no !
you're not going home .
get out there and get it overwith .
yes , you will .
yes , you will .
get it overwith now .
where were we?
two chicky wickies?
yes , please .
allrighty .
anything else?
two meatballs and one pate .
and 200 grams of roast beef .
happy to oblige .
he's going at it out back .
is he cutting down a tree?
no , just working , as we say .
a small one like this?
there you go .
we'll never talk about this again .
tomorrow we just say that there are no more chicken fillets ...
chicky wickies .
that's what i call them .
svend's chicky wickies .
svend , stop it .
yes , of course .
that's that .
that's that .
i nevertold you this
but my parents died when i was very young .
yes , you have .
many times .
and i wasn't popular at school so i got beaten every day .
the other kids were free to pick on me
because i didn't have any parents .
yes sirree .
they hit me and stole my lunch money .
that's why i'm so skinny .
i didn't get anything to eat before i began training as a butcher .
sometimes they'd hit me with stuff .
with wood ...
and with flashlights ...
and with a green bicycle pump ...
and with belts ...
enough with the examples .
it doesn't matter .
what are you trying to say?
i'm very well aware that i'm not a charming person .
people have always treated me rough .
they've called me names .
they called me ... you know ...
svend sweat?
yes , let me tell you ...
i was always afraid .
i was afraid to go to school .
i was afraid to die .
i was afraid of girls .
i was afraid of people
and to some extent i still am , let me tell you .
but then i met tina
and i thought that things would get a lot better , but they didn't .
that was when i decided to open my own shop .
how the fuck did you work that out?
perhaps i didn't say it right ...
no .
i'm tired and confused .
we'll see each other tomorrow .
but , bjarne , i would like ...
i can rephrase it .
i can put it more bluntly .
i've never been loved .
the cat is out of the bag .
that's it .
and?
and today ... here ...
what i had here today behind the counter , bjarne ...
it was fantastic .
it was great .
people spoke to me differently .
they smiled at me .
suddenly i was someone else and i really liked that .
don't be angry , bjarne
but we can't open tomorrow without more meat .
we can't .
it stops here .
it's sick and i don't want to hear anymore about it .
that really hurt .
you're insane .
it's only a problem to be insane and not know it .
see you tomorrow .
i'm not here right now .
leave a message .
it's ingrid grith .
i know how you feel
but i have to tell you that we'll turn off your brother tomorrow . his organs will be used for transplants .
we're very grateful . have a nice evening .
hi .
hi .
i was just passing by .
do you always sit in there alone?
yes .
sometimes .
the undertaker leaves at four .
he doesn't have time for it all .
in the winter there's a lot to do .
many give up at christmas
so i help out .
it's more fun than feeding chickens .
i hear the shop is doing well .
oh , did you hear that?
everybody is talking about you .
well ...
yes , business is very good .
i thought ... when the chickens have been fed ... have you eaten?
no .
do you want to?
i know a place .
hello?
house hans?
yes ...
that's actually why i'm here .
you should just call me hans from now on .
it sounds silly anyway .
i guess you know that .
you shouldn't make your job your identity .
oh ... yes ...
is that why you're here?
i was in the neighborhood so i thought i would drop by
and see how you were .
everything is fine .
does anyone know you're here?
no .
why do you ask?
no reason , let me tell you ...
it's been a long day .
lots of customers ...
let's look at the shop then .
let's start with the meat locker .
it's really great .
let me tell you ...
dark and cold , huh?
isn't there any light?
sure .
over in the corner .
i'm really impressed .
you've done a great job .
hello?
hello , what happened?
i think the door closed .
hello?
let me out .
this isn't funny .
hello .
i'm sorry i haven't cleaned the place .
i had a break in ...
when?
i don't know .
a few years ago .
it's okay .
all these skeletons .
have you killed them all?
yes , except the whale .
i know it's a bit morbid , but it's been sort of a hobby .
like collecting coins .
you collect skeletons .
it sounds stupid , right?
my colleague svend says that it's sick .
how did you kill this one?
that one i killed with a piece of cloth .
i don't have any tea .
i have lots of weed .
will that do?
yes , if you have milk and sugar .
why are you so chipper?
what's up with you?
nothing .
yes , what's up with you?
i've met a girl .
really?
i've met a girl .
it's nothing .
nothing?
let me tell you , it's something .
we're on our way now .
can't you feel it?
what the fuck are you wearing?
come with me .
these are our new uniforms .
they're great , don't you think?
yes , they're very ...
come on .
there's a hat too .
yes .
jesus fucking christ !
svend , you psycho .
you've gone completely insane .
i should like to explain .
thank you .
last night i went outside and he was lying in the street .
bjarne , it's him .
it's our realtor .
is that house hans?
he just wants to be called hans .
let me finish .
there he was .
dead as a doornail .
i just took him inside .
we have to report it .
he was already dead .
that's all .
that's all .
i'm not lying .
he was dead .
i'm leaving .
i want out .
do we have to do this again?
you haven't got a clue , do you?
what do you mean?
he was already dead .
do you think that it's a coincidence that you've met a nice girl?
astrid?
don't you think that it's strange that you meet a girl all of a sudden?
hasn't she asked about the shop?
that's how it works , bjarne .
you're a success , and i'm a success .
that's why anita wants you .
because we're a success .
her name is astrid .
exactly .
could you carve him up?
let's set up over here .
okay .
anything else?
no .
what time will that air?
at four in the morning .
one dollar .
turn off the ventilator .
go ahead .
wait a minute .
what?
his pulse is stable .
that can't be true .
hi .
hi .
i'm sorry i'm late .
i've been out all night .
sure .
i've taken care of the shop .
i've been out all night .
do you know who called me?
someone who found your brain?
beate did .
beate?
yes .
you know , the one you met at the barbecue .
she saw me on tv .
we went to that new club .
we got in for free , because they had also seen me on tv .
tonight we're going bowling .
bowling?
you're going bowling?
would you like to see a new car?
have you bought a new car?
yes , let me tell you ...
it's almost entirely green .
what's that?
a small swede from the park .
svend , i can't do this anymore .
you know the power lines behind the sawmill , right?
everybody knows that they are dangerous ...
bjarne , what's happening?
make him leave .
make him disappear now !
take it easy .
hello .
i could like to talk to bjarne .
is he here?
no comment .
anything else?
no !
is bjarne coming?
please don't yell at me .
i can't help it .
brain damage .
but eigil should still be treated like everybody else in this house .
is bjarne coming?
no .
you shouldn't be here .
please leave .
don't you understand danish?
i'm not going into this with you now .
leave .
but i'm the little eigil sweetie .
you may be , but not in here .
yes !
no .
yes !
no .
yes !
let me tell you something .
don't threaten me with that giraffe .
please point it somewhere else , so that we may discuss this calmly .
would you ...
if you see bjarne , then say hello from me .
give him this .
it's a small chipmunk .
from eigil .
there's a dog .
closed
bjarne?
bjarne , don't worry .
he has left .
i don't understand how that can happen .
it's a miracle .
i didn't believe it myself .
give him a shot or something .
we had a deal .
you saved him .
on the ventilator he never would have woken up .
then lock him up or keep him here .
is it because you've taken out a loan against his inheritance?
no , the shop is doing fine .
eigil is a retard .
yes , no doubt , but he misses you .
no .
his head is just messed up .
i think you're projecting .
maybe you have some issues .
have you tried eating a drumstick in front of him?
i know that he's a vegetarian .
he told the kitchen .
he's obsessed with animals .
and you became a butcher .
can't you see the problem?
no .
i think you have to forgive eigil .
shut the fuck up .
what happened in the accident?
keep him away from me .
lock him up .
i don't give a fuck .
you need help and if you won't let us help , i have to speak to svend .
how do you know svend?
from tv .
he's the only sane person that you'll listen to .
then go down to the shop and have a chat with him .
just keep eigil away from me .
we need more pate .
everything is selling like crazy .
the chickens have gone bad .
throw them out .
chop chop , we have ...
wow , her hands are big .
i haven't begun on her yet .
what did she say?
what do you say in a situation like that?
she cried .
she yelled " let me out " .
i meant before that .
some nonsense about you and your brother and you needing a shrink .
i don't want to talk about it .
four chickies .
no , chicky wickies .
chicky wickies .
that's right .
yes , you .
out .
we don't want anymore .
we're trying to run a business .
give it to bjarne .
it's for bjarne .
it's a little dog .
if you don't understand me , then let's do it like this .
goodbye .
i know that you are there behind the bricks .
it's me eigil , bjarne .
eigil the little funster is here .
no !
no , no , no ...
do you often come here?
yes , sometimes .
you should come to the church tower and see shooting stars .
along with the weird priest?
yes .
is it true that he was in a plane crash and had to eat his own wife?
yes .
they were on their honeymoon .
they crashed into a mountain .
everybody died but him .
he was almost frozen when they found him .
he survived because he ate her .
why didn't he eat someone else?
i have no idea .
do you live with him?
i have my own room .
when my parents died he was really sweet .
he helped with all the arrangements and had them sent home .
how did they die?
like yours .
in germany between karlsruhe and stuttgart .
don't you want to run away?
run away?
no , why do you want to do that?
i don't want to do this anymore .
a lot has happened since we opened the shop .
is it me?
no , you're the only good thing .
what is it then?
everything .
svend has gone crazy .
and my ...
no , it doesn't matter .
it's boring to talk about .
if you don't run away , i would like to help you .
no matter what it is .
hi , astrid .
you know holger from rotary , don't you?
yes .
i'm going to bed .
where have you been?
out with bjarne .
goodnight .
my bjarne?
yes , i think they're dating .
i must say that they are doing fucking great .
but there's something wrong .
what do you mean?
those idiots forget to unzip before taking a piss .
and now they're a big success .
people are standing in line .
i don't understand it either .
with all due respect for your otherwise excellent dinner
i didn't care for your chicken .
why not?
it had a peculiar aftertaste .
the others loved it .
if only i hadn't held that dinner , nobody would've heard about them .
what didn't you like?
it's probably just me .
but it made me think of grethe .
i actually thought it tasted like grethe .
like grethe?
fly away up to god and ask for fair weather .
hi .
what are you doing?
i'm playing hide and seek .
you have to find little eigil .
come on .
i won't hurt you .
all right .
i'm coming .
what are they doing here?
it's a chicken family .
they have been murdered by knife .
why did you do that?
no reason .
that's weird .
what's your name?
eigil per amager , but i only use eigil .
you're bjarne's brother .
yes .
yes , i am .
there , there .
you can't bury animals here .
i can .
no .
yes , eigil can do everything .
have you seen bjarne?
no .
no , i said .
he's hiding in his shop .
look at the chicken .
it's dead .
would you like to see some live chickens?
i have seen that plenty of times
but i may be persuaded if they are big .
it's a giraffe .
it's my giraffe .
this is my dog skip .
this is skip .
it bit bjarne all the time .
it bit him?
he kicked it sometimes .
he's allergic to dogs .
but they let me , because i love dogs .
are dogs your favorite animal?
no , all animals are .
this is eigil .
what's this one called?
it's eigil .
do you know what this one is called?
eigil?
yes , exactly .
are we going out to the chickens?
no , enough with the chickens .
bjarne , wait .
bjarne !
stay away from me .
it's eigil , bjarne .
yes , it's eigil , bjarne .
we are looking at the chickens .
stay away from me .
stay away from me .
stay away from me .
what are you doing?
why did you do that?
leave me alone .
what's wrong?
you can't kick him like that .
why are you being an asshole?
you don't know what you're talking about .
tina ...
what are you doing here?
i just wanted to say hello .
how are you?
i'm just fine .
i saw you on tv .
comes with the territory .
have you read my interviews?
no .
i talked to the local paper .
i haven't read that .
i say some excellent things .
at least , that's what people tell me .
why haven't you seen that?
i just haven't seen that .
i get to see movies for free .
and i can also go bowling .
but you don't know how to bowl .
yes , i do .
i've seen it .
you can't .
i beg to differ .
people say i'm good .
don't you remember when you slipped in your own sweat?
we had to go to the er on the way home .
don't you remember?
house hans petersen was a realtor .
he was probably fed up .
our children can be annoying .
he often talked about starting over .
so ... now he's left .
we follow his trail to thailand where he was last seen .
yes , i saw him yesterday .
220 danes disappear every year .
we try to figure out why .
watch " missing danes " tonight .
it's sausage holger .
you have to excuse my late call .
you deliver meat to svend and bjarne , right?
they are my boys , so i would like to know how much they sell .
how many chickens?
how much poultry a week?
bjarne , i'm afraid i've done something stupid .
i don't care .
listen to me .
i think i've crossed the line this time .
i don't care .
give me the knife and open the shop .
yes , you're right .
i'm probably just being hyper sensitive .
the bird is flying .
astrid , would you come in here?
sure .
no , can't he stay outside?
okay .
if you can catch the black one , you're the greatest .
you should listen to holger .
it's about bjarne .
you should sit down .
well , astrid , the problem is that svend and bjarne ...
we are fairly certain that they are killing all my customers .
what are you talking about?
they butcher them like cattle .
and they sell the meat in their shop .
it's true .
they haven't killed anyone .
i'm saying this for your own sake .
you should get out while you can .
thank you .
they have only bought 8 chickens .
why does their meat taste like grethe?
i don't know , but they haven't done anything .
astrid , haven't you noticed
that eigil isn't the kind of guy you ask for help with the crosswords?
those boys have problems .
eigil came out 7 minutes later than bjarne .
his brain didn't get any oxygen .
those minutes are the problem .
how do you mean?
the parents ruined everything .
they let eigil decide everything .
just until one day in june when it went too far .
you know about the accident , yes?
no .
a giraffe was born in stockholm zoo
and eigil wanted to see it .
the family made a trip out of it .
eigil wanted to drive , and they let him .
even though bjarne objected .
eigil is eager to get there , so he drives fast .
very fast .
bjarne begged him to slow down .
he had his new wife with him .
but eigil wanted to go to stockholm and get a gander at the giraffe .
excuse the expression .
quite all right , holger .
they get to the coast , and then everything goes wrong .
ironically , it's a deer that jumps out in front of the car
and eigil swerves to avoid it .
it's a blood bath .
a halal butchering of olympic dimensions .
the parents and the wife die and eigil ends up in a coma .
bjarne breaks an arm and a leg
but the deer gets away scot free
because eigil chose to swerve .
afterwards bjarne snaps .
he roams around at night killing animals
until the police hands him over to me
and i , by the grace of god , take him in .
bjarne is sick .
stay away from him .
but it's not until you put him together with that insane svend sweat
that it goes wrong .
i know that they've done this .
you've gone mad .
stay away from him .
hi , astrid .
look at me .
i'm playing with the little birds .
i'm flying .
eigil , let me show you what happens to chickens .
i'm going home .
okay .
are you going out tonight?
no , i have a stomachache .
i don't want to see any people .
then don't go into the meat locker .
how about you?
are you going over to astrid?
no .
we can talk about it if you want .
no .
bjarne ...
please stay and talk .
svend , i can't do it anymore .
see you .
hi .
is bjarne here?
no .
you shouldn't be here .
he shouldn't be here .
you have to leave .
it's dangerous to be here .
eigil will behave .
we have killed chickens for bjarne .
no , you have to respect me .
you have to leave now .
you don't understand .
you can't be here with me .
i don't feel well .
i don't want to talk about it .
go away .
he'll be good .
he'll be good .
we just want to talk to bjarne .
do you know where he is?
why can't you just leave?
we want to talk to him .
he's out in the meat locker .
come on .
i forgot that there are two of you .
yes .
is astrid around?
come on inside .
they're pretty .
do you like plants?
sure .
mine usually die .
how do you get them to grow like that?
light and warmth .
a bright and warm room creates life .
you have to praise them and tell them that they're pretty .
all these plants have helped me
to fill out the void after grethe .
you know what it's like .
i couldn't let her go for a long time .
where is astrid?
grethe seemed to be in me .
she was in a way .
how do you mean?
didn't you eat her?
yes , i did .
i'm glad i did to this day .
is astrid coming soon?
she probably is .
the good thing about astrid is that she lives in this life .
you should do the same .
or at least try to .
you can't turn a turtle into a racehorse .
but you can turn it into a fast turtle .
okay .
how long will astrid be?
she actually went to your shop .
weren't you tired?
has astrid been here?
no .
why?
it's just that ...
what , bjarne?
i'm sorry .
i thought ...
it doesn't matter .
see you tomorrow .
you said you didn't want to see her .
what the fuck are you doing?
are you crazy?
stay away from me .
it was just a joke .
a joke?
it's not funny to lock people up .
psychos !
i ...
don't !
stay away from me .
you're all crazy .
you and you and your crazy brother .
fuck you !
please don't leave .
stay away from me .
don't !
well , that's up to her .
take it easy .
bjarne , i'm leaving .
i'm leaving .
i didn't know that she ...
can i hold your hand?
no .
just a little bit?
no .
brother bjarne ...
don't you even have two for me?
there are no more chicky wickies until svend comes back .
we were looking forward to it .
maybe i can do something , but the meat will be different .
what kind of meat?
chicken .
some other chicken .
as long as the marinade is the same .
sure .
it's svend's marinade .
i have to ask you all to leave .
the shop is closed .
we're from the fda .
thank you .
i'll take over from here .
i have to ask you all to leave .
the shop is closed .
we're from the fda .
okay , chicky wickies for everybody .
what's happening?
you're through .
where is the sweating swine?
i don't know .
what do you want?
leif larsen from fda .
we've received a report
that you sell unauthorised meat .
where's the queue?
why is there no queue?
the fda is here .
svend , wait .
what's going on?
you found a new victim , didn't you?
you're out to get me .
you may succeed .
i may be guilty .
done is done .
so just take the meat .
take my meat and run out if you have any use for it .
do you?
this is bjarne .
i would like to stress that he is not involved .
i'm guilty .
if you can talk about guilt .
but i would like to ask if any of you can look me in the eye and say
that i don't deserve my success?
wait ...
no , you can't .
you all want to make something that people will love .
i may have ...
don't mind them .
they do that sometimes .
bjarne , that really hurt .
this is just chicken in marinade .
that can't be .
i can't find anything .
there are some joint butts , but you find that everywhere .
oh ...
then we checked the place .
that's surely always a good thing .
if there's no more meat , what did you sell?
chicken .
then it's over , bjarne .
people don't want that .
then it's over .
i don't think so .
yes , i think so
and that's good .
i tasted your marinade .
yes ...
it's good .
it's the best i've ever tasted .
it's good .
i don't think the meat is all that good .
i think the marinade did it .
are you saying that my marinade is good?
yes , your marinade is good .
everybody thinks so .
one wasn't allowed on the bus under any circumstances .
they were afraid of the pig .
we'll work it out , eigil .
come on .
what an outrage .
that's what they said on the bus .
throw the ball , eigil .
no , svend will take it .
no , i won't , idiot .
i have my own .
yes .
you have to throw them in order to play .
then throw yours , svend .
i'll throw it , when he does .
you're kidding?
my ball is bigger than yours .
i beg to differ .
it is .
i'm not discussing this .
mine is bigger .
i can even blow it up more .
can i sit here for a while?
sure .
astrid !
isn't my ball bigger than his?
yes , yours is much bigger , eigil .
stop that nonsense .
come on down and measure them , or i'll go home , let me tell you !
my ball is the biggest .
everybody loves eigil .
shut up .
svend sweats , but eigil is sweet .
i would rather sweat than be you , four eyes .
we don't say four eyes !
retard four eyes .
everybody prefers eigil .
really?
should we ask people if they prefer you or me?
no , because you don't dare .
yes !
