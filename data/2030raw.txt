wanna meet today?
are you pretty?
of course .
can i see your face?
sure .
do you like what you see?
yeah , i do .
how much?
how much do you usually pay?
it's my first time ...
how about 200, 000 won?
great .
we'll decide on the spot .
you're not a cop , right?
if you're not , then we're not either .
there was a prostitute in india named vasumitra .
vasumitra?
what a pretty name .
words say that any man who slept with her , turned into a devoted buddhist .
what the hell did she do to them?
she gave a ecstatic sex as a prostitute , i guess .
what does sex have to do with buddihsts?
maybe it aroused some deep maternal love .
you see , men are like babies when they have sex .
yeo jin , call me vasumitra from now on .
close your mouth .
got it?
i'm vasumitra from today on .
isn't that him?
look out for me .
yeo jin !
how can you laugh?
'cause it's fun .
stop right there !
he stopped chasing us .
wanna eat some pig's feet?
pig's feet?
the money?
how much do we have now?
a little more than one person's airfare .
i guess i'll have to meet ten more .
hey , that's dirty .
come on , i was eating it .
that guy ...
do you know his occupation?
who cares .
have you heard of sensors?
sensors?
you've seen those glass doors open when you approach them .
they are all sensor operated .
he says he runs a shop that sells those sensors .
he said sensors had another use .
what was it again?
stop talking nonsense .
what's the use knowing what those beasts do?
tell me !
why are you getting mad?
i'm just curious about what they do .
even though it's brief , we're still sharing something .
it's too dreary if there's only sex .
you vasumitra idiot .
come here .
i'm not dirty .
it's filthy .
you don't know anything about those guys .
i'm sorry i pulled you into this .
let's stop .
i'm scared that this would haunt me forever .
it's not even a murder .
it's not that hard on me .
there is some fun too .
and we need more money to buy two tickets to europe .
let's be patient .
you seem like you're enjoying it .
yeo jin , eat before you go to school .
you have a test today .
i don't wanna take the test .
i won't take it .
let's eat .
do you know that today's your mom's memorial?
did you get the suspect?
i'm still investigating .
at the notre dame cathedral in avignon , france .
there's a wooden statue of jesus christ .
the wood is so old and rotted , you can't recognize the face .
even one of his arms is gone .
are you with me?
yes .
then suddenly one day a bud sprouted from the wood .
but it has no roots ...
it's so mysterious , isn't it?
the quarry in misari?
at two?
okay .
see you there .
did you set it up?
yeah
misari at two .
let's go .
don't they say that your voice is different?
nope .
i feel strange .
it's not like i'm the one doing it , but i call and handle the money .
i was supposed to do your makeup at the beginning .
why do you have me do everything?
i'm sorry .
i can't do anything without you .
no , you're the one who is suffering .
don't ask about their occupations from now on .
okay .
yeo jin , get in .
he's gonna buy us dinner .
today's my mom's memorial .
you don't have a mom?
if you're done , then go .
get out !
get out now !
what's wrong , yeo jin?
get out now !
what's with you?
am i filthy to you?
i said if you're done , then go .
you think i'm filthy .
don't you?
i'm filthy , huh?
what are you looking at?
you want me , too?
crazy bastard .
yeo jin , what's with you?
he's a good guy .
he's a musician .
what's with you?
what's wrong with him buying us dinner?
how could you eat with him after what he's done to you?
what has he done to me?
they're all filthy bastards !
don't say like that .
i'm the one who was with him .
he's such a good guy .
he even sang for me .
there was more than just sex .
damn you .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
i must've done something wrong again .
he just makes me comfortable .
that's all .
i'm sorry .
i won't hurt your feelings again .
i won't ask about their occupations either .
i'll just ...
i'll just ...
i'll just have sex .
i'm sorry .
it pisses me off that any guy can touch this beautiful thing .
he's not 'any guy '.
do you like that guy?
be honest .
i could tell from your eyes .
how could you get those feelings in less than an hour?
time isn't important .
i'll stop liking him , okay?
which look do you want?
how about indian costume?
if you're ready to take your picture .
press the okay button .
okay .

i always listened .
in a country town in italy , three young girls went to go play in the forest .
suddenly , in the sky
mother mary appeared in a blinding light .
it was so bright , they all fainted .
while they were unconscious , they saw a terrible and grim vision of the world's end .
so right as they woke up , they were terrified and told the town preacher .
dad , are you nervous about your life?
do you believe in miracles?
i wish a miracle would happen .
why didn't you shave today?
i forgot to .
you didn't wash your face either .

i'd like for you to go back the way you came .
why aren't you coming?
i have to go home by five .
hurry up .
you're crying?
did someone die?
hurry over .
i'll comfort you .
what is it?
your makeup isn't a good match .
take it off .
you too .
your earring is in country fashion ...
what's with the long face?
why'd you call me here if you won't talk?
