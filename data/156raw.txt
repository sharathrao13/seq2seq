riggs , you sure we're on the right street?
we must be getting warm .
you see anything?
where?
i don't see anything .
this must be the place .
holy shit !
what the hell is that?
jesus !
who's this joker?
i don't know .
a spokesman for the nra .
regular asshole .
what do we do now?
run him over .
what if he shoots us with that rifle?
he hasn't yet .
maybe he won't .
what if he does?
don't be a don't bee .
be a do bee .
be positive .
positive?
run him over .
glad you see things my way .
i hope he doesn't turn .
he won't .
we'll creep up on him so he won't notice .
will him not to turn .
power of positive thinking .
don't turn .
will him with me .
don't turn around .
i need you .
don't turn around !
just believe !
don't turn around !
we're better than him .
we're better !
he's turning .
they just bounce off him !
i saw !
we're in trouble !
shit !
i'll draw his fire .
you run for cover .
no , i'll draw his fire .
you run for cover .
are you crazy? !
you got a wife , kids .
i got less to lose !
get out of here !
i'm not supposed to tell you , but lorna's pregnant .
what'd you say?
you'll be a father !
she was afraid to tell you .
she was afraid you'd get angry .
you never talked about children?
shit !
a baby .
there's something i'm not supposed to tell you too .
rianne's pregnant .
you're going to be a grandfather .
rianne's what? !
rianne can't be pregnant .
she's not married .
i don't think she intended to get that way .
they asking me to be a granddaddy?
here's what we'll do .
take your clothes off !
what for?
okay , you run .
flame o sees you in your undies .
it distracts him , then i shoot .
shoot what?
the valve on that napalm tank !
before he shoots me?
maybe .
maybe? !
is he black?
too much armor on .
i can't tell !
no !
not him !
the father of the baby !
please let him be black !
get going !
here he comes !
are those hearts?
not now , riggs .
just hit the damn valve !
also , flap and make noises like a bird .
flap my arms?
why?
it'll distract him more .
i need him to turn .
on 2 !
we always go on 3 .
no time for 3 .
2 !
what about 1?
okay .
1 , 2 , go !
i don't want to die in my underwear !
why are you waiting?
shoot the bastard !
riggs , you think that bird thing helped?
i just wanted to see if you'd do it .
cute shorts .
go spit !
i'll buy you a doughnut .
don't hug me when i'm naked .
you're ashamed of your butt?
he's a lively one .
that shark hurts my boat , i take it out on you , leo .
i didn't mean to catch it .
why do you want to keep it?
yeah , why keep a shark?
the teeth'll look great on a wall .
they got to stop snapping first .
maybe he'll fall asleep .
converse with him .
he'll nod off .
he don't look tired .
chewing on leo will wear him out .
sharks eat their own kind?
stop it !
i'm in stitches !
okay , where's my bag?
starboard side aft .
starboard , that's left , right?
no , port's left .
starboard's right .
right , yeah .
right side aft .
got it !
whatever .
check both sides .
careful !
he's behind you , shark !
maybe we should throw him overboard .
throw them both overboard .
no witnesses .
we'd probably get away with it .
you too?
i kept my nose out of it ... ... but you and lorna .
you're having a baby , you're living together .
you're not marrying .
why , does that violate your family values system?
i'm just trying to understand .
rianne's not married either .
that's hitting below the belt .
you know , when i was married ... ... it was good .
you know .
you put the ring on .
you make the commitment .
you do all the ....
she's dead because i'm a cop .
she's dead because i'm a cop and i ...
i don't wear the ring anymore ... ... but i look , and it's still there .
i still feel it .
it's like i'm not finished with that yet .
i can't explain it .
is that bullshit?
no .
it's not finished .
it's not finished .
okay , you did say " aft "?
a f t. aft !
that's a fucking word?
in the back on the right side , leo !
why didn't you say that to begin with , roger? !
people get around boats and water , everything becomes nautical !
astern !
avast , you landlubbers !
man the bilge pump !
pump your fucking ass !
all right , all right !
no problem , no problem !
what's lorna say about it?
she doesn't like nautical terms either .
we haven't discussed it .
that's pretty messed up .
the baby's due in days and you haven't talked about marrying?
no .
i haven't done it at all .
do we want leo to shoot the shark?
i want leo to shoot ...
no , leo !
what? !
what's the deal? !
you're shooting a gun on my boat !
i'm not shooting your boat , i'm shooting jaws .
nobody's killing it just to have its teeth !
you're grumpy since you learned you'll be a grandpa .
get off of me , will you?
don't fool around !
some piece of hardware !
got a permit?
of course !
i'm a p. i. now .
a gumshoe !
you get in ugly situations .
i got guns !
you are an ugly situation .
you don't deserve this .
you're not safe .
smart move , riggs .
shit !
hard right !
you hear shots?
coast guard , this is code 7 .
we're in l. a. harbor .
we got an 07 .
they're getting away !
who was it?
do we know?
no , no , i'll drive !
want me to help?
get out of here !
this your gun?
yeah , want laser surgery?
you could blind somebody !
coast guard , this is code 7 , in pursuit of freighter .
heading north .
awaiting instructions .
over .
code 7 , maintain your present course .
we have a cutter en route .
why you slowing down?
we'll hang here .
coast guard'll be here soon .
what do we do now?
show them our badges .
lapd !
lapd !
los angeles police department !
we heard gunfire !
the coast guard's on the ...
coast guard !
freighter's on fire !
let's board them .
what are you talking about? !
fire on the freighter !
okay , i'm upside .
now what do you do?
they're getting away .
get me up there !
hell of a fishing trip !
shut up and keep your head down !
lapd !
stop where you are !
hold it right there !
he's got it !
he's got it !
what'd he say?
watch his back !
you didn't say you'd shoot !
tie it up !
pull it up !
great !
i said keep the boat closer !
why listen to leo?
shit !
you all right , riggs? !
look !
shit !
jump !
jump !
where are you?
my boat !
my new boat !
the shark .
what about the shark?
shark !
don't leave me !
come on !
hurry up !
i'm coming !
you'll make it !
this is all i got left .
four sets of papers , totally genuine .
they'll get in the country and can stay forever .
u. s. citizens .
ask them to vote the incumbent party .
help me keep my state department job .
bloody marvelous !
they red flag asian visas .
those were hard to slip through .
the ship's been impounded .
what about the family?
we don't know yet .
don't worry .
i'll take care of it .
something wrong?
a small delivery problem , mr. proody .
goodbye .
leave !
i'll find them .
now .
coast guard interdicts about one a month .
pretty raggedy looking .
six weeks locked in a hole with one toilet .
rice and some fish to eat .
lousy deal for 35 grand a head .
where'd they get that kind of money?
didn't .
got to work it off from the snakeheads , the smugglers .
they sell them as cheap labor .
sell them?
like slaves .
these must be the lucky ones .
they'll claim asylum .
say they were persecuted , like everybody else .
we'll send them packing .
cost you and me a fortune .
what happened to , " bring me your tired , your poor ... ... your wretched masses , yearning to be free "?
now it reads , " no vacancies .
i guess your parents were native americans .
they pop one every boatload .
shows the rest what'll happen if they run off .
he's nobody's slave now .
don't coddle them , move them !
i see this barrel coming down .
murtaugh didn't see it , so i push him .
i knock him over .
we're in the water .
i pull because he can't swim .
i got to save him .
there's that kid .
what's his name?
bissel?
it's a food .
burger !
no , biscuits or something .
he always kisses my ass , gives me coffee and shit .
sergeant riggs , sergeant murtaugh .
what are you doing here?
that's a long story .
you're all wet !
you need a blanket?
i'm fine .
somebody get this man a blanket now !
yes , sir !
get this body out of here .
what do we got here?
step back , step back .
shit !
he's dead .
he's fucking dead !
shit !
what?
this is how he wanted to come to america?
was he in the killing section?
this guy's been shot four times !
at close range , like he was executed !
he was executed .
by the crew .
people get killed left , right and center in this town !
now we import victims?
gangbangers kill each other , no problem !
one of us gets shot , occupational hazard !
but just a normal guy?
what did he ever do to anybody? !
that ain't right .
easy , biscuits .
you'll get an ulcer .
settle down .
blanket !
sorry , blankets .
sorry , i'm losing my head .
i hate to see bad things happen to good folk .
we'd stick around , butler , but you're in charge so ...
you should take this , it's free .
you're all wet .
get some vapor rub on your chest .
all right , boogers .
hey , get them out of here !
get them out of here !
he takes the job kind of personally .
yeah , he's pretty serious , i'd say .
overzealous .
jealous of who?
i don't know .
who?
you said he was jealous .
you just said ...
i said he was zealous .
full of zeal .
he's loud too .
he's loud !
what?
we better get up before the sun's up .
i got something in the lifeboat .
that's okay , i'll catch a squad ride .
i'm sorry about your boat .
i'm sorry .
shit !
suddenly , a big fucking shark comes ...
can i say that?
you can say it , but we can't air it .
so this big darn shark comes along ....
my code 7 .
you were coming home last night .
i'm sorry .
i had some bad chinese .
you look a little banged up .
you look a little knocked up .
are you okay?
you sure?
easy , tiger !
there he goes again .
there she goes again .
you okay?
i'm better than roger .
his boat sank .
boat sank?
i had something to do with it .
no !
no grease !
have some cookies .
what happened?
gunfights , explosions , sharks .
the usual .
here , boy .
thanks .
you were fishing .
does trouble go looking for you?
it seems to know pretty much where i am most of the time .
you finished the nursery .
yeah , i did .
it's good for a girl or boy .
cute , huh?
it's a dogfest !
did you get the whole 1 01?
i know .
i got a little carried away with puppies .
kid'll probably hate dogs .
you know , lorna , we never ever talked about marriage .
i figured you didn't want that .
you want to get married?
well , no .
me neither .
breakfast?
serve and protect .
since when do you read this smut?
it's not smut , it's ebony clark .
trish gave it to me .
every fiber in his being desired her .
he devoured her with his eyes .
can we try this thing on page 1 96 sometime?
there's a good one on 1 68 .
maybe later .
nothing comes between a pregnant lady and a meal .
have i ever " made your womanhood reach peaks ... ... to rival the himalayas "?
foothills of malibu , maybe .
not even a teton?
i don't think so .
thanks .
i thought i'd at least rate the rockies .
you know i'm kidding .
you say that to make me feel better .
no , i don't .
you know i'm playing .
i've been to plenty of mountaintops with you .
it's just that i'm hungry .
when you have that kid , we'll blow up mount saint helens .
i brought you a doughnut .
police food !
how did you know?
i dropped by lnternal affairs yesterday .
how's the rat squad?
i picked up something good .
some cheese?
i. a. got an anonymous tip .
the person said roger's on the take .
no , he's not .
i know !
it's probably some jerk he put away .
but with new boats and putting 2 kids through college ... ... i thought you ought to know .
i actually tried to persuade him to take money .
stop it , riggs !
i can't hear that !
nothing !
i won't say anything anymore .
i'm kidding .
that's awful .
i'm kidding .
don't tell him i said it .
with his problems ... ... he'll blow his top .
just don't say anything .
what do you mean?
like what?
in general , problems .
you mean something specific .
i got a nose for these things .
what?
you're pushing me .
i don't want you to go there .
get it off your chest .
you'll feel better .
i won't leave you alone till you tell me .
tell me .
i'll tell you !
pregnancy destroyed my brain cells !
what?
what?
i'm drooling .
what?
promise me you'll never say a word about this ever .
i swear , i swear .
right hand !
i swear i won't , ever .
i promise .
what?
you know how roger is about his daughter dating cops .
he'd kill them .
so?
rianne married one , her baby's father .
she's afraid to tell roger .
they met , fell in love .
she got pregnant , they got hitched .
nobody's telling roger?
after the baby's born .
it's a package deal?
take it or leave it?
does trish know?
she knows .
she doesn't know you know .
but trish knows .
who's the lucky soon to be dead son in law?
who?
sergeant lee butters .
this just gets better !
no wonder he sucks up to rog .
brings him apples , blankets , coffee ....
not a word .
i'm telling you , nothing !
i won't tell .
he'd shoot me just for being the messenger .
he's my best friend .
it'd be wrong to mess with him .
i won't .
promise .
we don't have to discuss boys 'names .
we're having a girl .
okay .
piadora .
i like piadora .
that's sweet .
i love that name .
we're talking kids 'names .
has rianne picked any out?
we don't want to double up .
oscar for the boy , loreen if it's a girl .
i like lee butter .
better !
i like it better .
don't get me started .
i like those names .
captain wants to see us .
trish'll be right down .
have fun shopping for the baby .
bye bye , honey .
who had the sleepover?
just airing out camping gear .
we're out of here .
something smells good .
really good !
trish has food on the stove .
we're out of here .
that smells like chinese food .
chinese food?
she's into chinese cooking .
i got to taste this .
i love chinese food .
hold it !
please !
please !
there's a chinese person in the kitchen .
i saw him .
a couple of chinese people .
actually a whole family .
large family .
hey , guys !
it does smell good .
great !
they hid in the lifeboat .
i had to do something .
so you brought them home .
it took two trips .
really?
they fit in the station wagon?
that's ping with his grandfather , hong .
he's head of the family .
speaks english .
hong , this is my partner , martin riggs , and lorna .
wife?
can we speak?
lorna , this is the best breakfast .
i'm hungry .
i'd love some .
this is illegal .
as in , " against the law " .
you'll bring a shitstorm down on you .
just hold on !
just wait a frigging minute !
the way i see it , those are slave ships out there .
and i'm freeing slaves ... ... iike no one did for my ancestors .
it's my chance to do something and do it right .
why didn't you say so?
this won't be boring .
need any help?
where is he?
what this time , food or money?
food and money .
money .
i see you more than when you lived here .
we're independent now .
what's the money for?
hookers , drugs ...
contraceptives .
can you believe how they talk to me?
it costs more to go to school now .
i get the tuition bills .
and the grades too !
this is a down payment on a future ass chewing .
get out and go to school .
i see the tuition .
i want to see some grades !
i want more cluck for my buck .
thanks for the money .
i'm tired .
me , i can't win .
boy !
did we get a raise and nobody told me?
i got to get to the bank .
how can you when you're taken to the cleaners all the time?
hey , guys .
hey , trish !
both the kids leave?
yes .
and we're broke .
is lorna here?
she's in the kitchen , on her third breakfast .
i remember those days .
i'm sorry !
i love it when you do that .
you look terrific .
wait till she tries raising that baby by herself .
i'll be fine .
move back in and grandpa'll be up nights with the baby .
better than her marrying the wrong guy .
a cop or something .
true .
come on , guys .
see you .
i should say goodbye .
hurry up !
stuffing your face !
stop kissing me .
try that .
stay away from my girl .
i'm not joking .
stay away from my girl .
joking !
got the baby beeper?
i know .
it's your fault .
it's your fault .
all the chicken shit .
flapping all over the place .
all right , everybody !
it's been a year almost .
this shit ain't funny no more !
enough is enough !
please !
enough !
i'm the one that gets it in the neck .
can we exercise maturity?
if i find who's doing this , i'll kick his ass .
i catch that asshole who put my picture up , that's it !
cut their balls off .
captain .
i look out expecting to see all the old faces .
instead , i see kids whose names i barely remember .
will you sit down?
we're dinosaurs headed for extinction .
speak for yourself .
guys with guns and psychology degrees , like butters out there .
biter has a psychology degree?
more like a psycho degree .
times have got to change .
i once got shot by a hot rodder with a zip gun .
that's how far back i go .
you wanted to see us?
some things don't change .
here we go .
the department lost its insurance .
all the damage you've done , they can't get a new one ... ... while you two still run around .
they can't fire you either .
so , they're promoting you .
lieutenant !
there's no open lieutenant spots .
so the chief used his special privilege , making you captains .
better .
captain !
time was when this would send me over the falls .
i'm getting old .
what do we do now?
captain shit !
hang out .
take long lunches .
yell , " riggs , murtaugh , i'm the captain .
chief's shitting bricks !
you finished?
can you stay out of trouble?
absolutely .
captain riggs !
captain murtaugh !
you want your badges?
let me see those sergeant badges .
throw them over here .
this is the most painful experience of my life .
now get out !
thank you , captain .
thank you , captain .
enough with the " captain " shit !
get out of here !
after you , captain , i insist !
o captain !
my captain !
captains outrageous !
news travels fast .
get a break from real police work .
play golf , tennis ....
they got brown rings around their noses
now that you're captains , come up in the chopper .
not for me .
i'll take a rain check .
if you change your mind , call us .
he's down to earth .
i'm sorry .
can we knock this off?
this is your captain speaking .
the man's got feelings , you know?
congratulations .
look at you !
captain murtaugh .
i don't know how to say this , but you really inspire me .
keep it up .
how's it going , burton?
it's butters , captain .
i'll remember that .
kid really likes you .
i wish he'd cut it out .
he likes me?
likes me?
you don't think he likes me ... ... iikes me like that?
it's the police , not the military .
the millennium's upon us .
new people , new department .
dr. woods?
captain riggs .
don't run .
i'm in a rush .
i need to talk to you .
what is it this time?
recurring dreams about flying dwarfs?
or did you cook up something new?
i'm sorry about all that .
i want your advice .
i was thinking of ...
thinking?
marriage .
marriage? !
the " m " word?
does " confidentiality " mean anything?
that's funny .
you know what'd happen?
we'd go in my office ... ... and you know what you'd tell me?
you'd tell me something like , " doc ... ... i want to marry murtaugh .
or your mother .
or nelson mandela !
nelson mandela? !
something to ridicule me , riggs .
something to get a rise out of me .
listen carefully !
i'm ... not ... stupid !
and my time is reserved ... ... for police officers with real needs and real problems .
have you got that? !
have you? !
ask me again?
no .
and you know what?
i don't like you .
stephanie?
i can't go out with you .
i'm in a relationship .
i think you need to see someone .
you'll find someone to love you .
not in this department .
but stop bothering me !
you're disgusting !
what's the matter with you people? !
what's shaking?
captain riggs .
captain murtaugh .
turn around and do that .
we're captains .
heard you were up to your ass in chinese .
the taller ones come up to the navel .
big enough to kick your ass .
what can i do for you?
one of the ship's crew shot an illegal , apparently under orders ... ... and we'd dearly like to know who's smuggling chinese .
we're pretty sure the big boss is benny chan .
uncle benny?
you know him?
when he was running smack .
we never nailed him .
benny's slippery .
where's he hang out?
he's got a nightclub , some restaurants .
he operates mainly out on north broadway .
here's the address .
hi , fellas .
there he is .
hey , burger !
summers .
butters .
what you got on the freighter homicide?
i talked to some illegals .
they only knew the shooter by sight .
the boat's registered under a dummy corporation out of lndonesia .
it'll be a rough one to crack , but we'll nail them .
you ever hear of benny chan?
no .
what kind of bad man is he?
real bad .
crime boss in chinatown .
if it's dirty and chinese , benny's doing it .
where do i find him?
at this restaurant .
i'm hungry for chinese .
how about you?
we're going there anyway .
we'll drive you .
let me get my jacket .
not with him .
he's doing good .
we might need backup .
spend time with him .
you might learn to love him .
like a son .
in law ... ... enforcement it pays to know your fellow officer .
sir , it'll be an honor to share egg rolls with you .
yeah , all right .
let's go .
share?
butters , it seems like you hate crime in a sort of personal way .
why do you say that , sir?
last night i noticed you were more than slightly miffed .
wasn't he , roger?
any particular reason?
about 1 50, 000 of them .
that's how many bullets zinged my neighborhood growing up .
couldn't go outside .
couldn't go near a window .
lived and ate on the floor , slept and watched tv on the floor .
i didn't learn to walk till i was 1 0 .
spent my formative years nose to nose with the family beagle .
when i work on a crime , i ain't thinking about the crime .
i'm thinking about that floor and it pisses me off .
we supposed to meet leo somewhere?
no , why?
because he's following us .
don't look .
who's leo?
maybe it's a coincidence .
what does he want?
i don't know .
let's find out .
fucking asshole !
bite me !
whatever !
whatever !
jerk !
you looking for us?
you saw me?
yeah , we saw you .
what you doing , leo?
i'm perfecting my tailing technique now that i'm a p. i.
he's a private eyesore .
inconspicuous vehicle !
i like it .
riggs , who's the perp?
what'd you bust him for?
i'm a perp?
a brother in a police car is automatically a perp?
look at my suit !
do i look like the crips 'accountant?
look at this badge , bitch !
check out the gun .
put the gun down !
license !
registration !
urine sample !
i got a badge too !
german jews didn't have it easy as kids !
so don't think you're the only one .
i knew you were a cop .
i was kidding .
i can smell a cop a mile away .
you saying i smell bad?
don't turn everything around !
you're so touchy .
these guys'll tell you .
we got a history together .
maybe we'll work together someday !
i'm the bomb !
we'll work together when i open a cereal shop , you leprechaun !
i didn't call you names , fuckface !
don't start !
don't fool around !
these guys'll tell you .
you're double parked .
officer , i'm just talking with the detectives .
we don't know this guy .
think he was drinking .
they're kidding .
come back !
i wasn't drinking !
they just said that .
blow your breath in my hand .
i can smell it already .
blow in my fucking ear !
you're all mine .
you're mine !
you promised to deliver the family .
they're not at the detention center .
they must have escaped .
the uncle won't finish until he sees them .
don't worry , they'll turn up .
in hong kong , you'd already be dead .
where's uncle benny?
he's not here .
is he in there?
i'm sure he is .
this way .
yes , it's a two way .
we have 3 people .

when i was a kid i had a pet frog .

let me tell you this .
i had this pet frog , name was froggy .
he was my best friend in the world .
i didn't have lots of friends .
in fact ... ... i had no friends .
i used to kiss the frog too .
i thought maybe ... ... it would turn into a princess since i was a boy .
and it could be ... ... my mother .
they told me that she left or something .
and my father was no bargain .
and so , just the frog ... ... froggy , was my friend .
i loved him and took him everywhere with me .
i was riding my bike one day ... ... he jumped out of the box ... ... and i ran him over with the back tire .
i killed him .
i was really heartbroken .
really .
he was my best friend , the only thing i ever loved .
and then i met you ... ... and roger .
you looked after me a lot more than you had to .
i'm terrible to you , leo .
no , it's okay .
it's okay .
you're my family ... ... and my friends .
you're not better friends than froggy , just different .
i just thought that might be relevant .
