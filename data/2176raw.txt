the indians say the curse began in the time of the ancients , and was passed down through the blood of generations .
there are legends of the wendigo and the coming of the red and the black .
legends of the day of reckoning , when death would consume the land , and good would face evil ... of the day the curse would be broken forever ... or grow stronger and live on to plague generations to come .
but ours was a story of survival , of two sisters bound by blood ... a bond that would not be broken .
that was our promise above all .
above men , above god ... above fate .
it was in our blood .
together forever .
i'm so cold .
me too .
ginger , i think we've lost our way .
we haven't lost anything , brigitte .
it's lost us .
easy .
shh .
come on .
come on !
fine then .
we'll all walk .
come on .
let's go .
hello?
ginger .
are you all right?
what happened here?
my sister ... gone .
many summers ... in the wind , in the trees and in the blood .
sisters .
they were hers and her sister's .
thank you .
say " thank you , " ginger .
thank you .
kill the boy ... ... or one sister kills the other .
whoa , whoa , whoa .
easy , easy , easy !
what's wrong with him?
it's all right .
ginger !
no , come back !
come back !
come back !
brigitte !
get it off me !
i can't !
i'm gonna go back to the camp and try and find the old woman .
don't leave me !
look at me .
count to 100 , and before you do , i'll be back .
all right?
one , two ...
three ...
four ... five ... six , seven , eight , nine , 10 , 11 ...
50 .
ginger !
55 , 56 ...
help !
please , somebody !
help us !
brigitte !
ginger .
98 , 99 ...
i'm not alone !
i'm counting !
100 .
you stay away from her , you son of a bitch !
you all right?
did he just whistle at us?
i'm sure he meant the dog .
son ...
welcome to civilization .
cormac !
do these two look like anyone you've ever laid eyes on , other than while you were off pulling in some shithouse somewhere?
answer me !
we don't ever open the gate for anyone we don't know .
do we?
you bloody idiot .
it's nearly nightfall ... we were looking for shelter .
here we never talk out of turn , and while i'm spitting , it is always my turn .
but i see it is not the first time your mouth has made you trouble , is it?
sergeant major , stand down .
mr. rowlands .
the dark one's hurt .
show me .
she's been bit .
how'd you come by that wound?
in the woods .
i stepped in a trap , and the indian helped us .
we were accompanying our father montgomery fitzgerald on his commission to find a pass through the mountains west , only our boat was overturned .
we washed up on shore , but our ... our parents were drowned .
cast them out , wallace .
cast them out .
you put us all in grave peril if you give them refuge .
mark me , wallace .
you've been marked .
let's let doc murphy see to it .
our parents drowned?
yes , but they didn't suffer .
it was really quite peaceful .
you'll have an ugly scar , but you'll keep the foot ... if we make sure it doesn't turn septic .
these ... ugly black bastards , they like the blood .
oh god , no !
but they'll settle for the sickness .
she doesn't want them on her .
it's a necessary evil .
my name is wallace rowlands .
i am chief factor at fort bailey .
and tonight , since you are our guests , dinner will be in the company hall .
ladies , mr. murphy .
do you feel that?
good .
be thankful .
it means you're alive .
i'll get you something for the pain .
i really don't have much to spare but ...
is it medicinal?
not in the least .
ginger?
i'm right here .
ah , enjoy it while it lasts , girl .
mr. murphy , those graves out there ... is it the pox?
no , it's not .
your fort's nearly abandoned .
most of the people have gone home .
the rest aren't sleeping too good .
what is everyone so afraid of?
didn't you see them ... out there in the woods?
we saw nothing .
not to worry , girl ... because they saw you .
it's good to have guests in the main house again .
you will find it more comfortable than your travels in the woods .
we passed an indian camp on the way .
it looked like it had been attacked .
oh?
hmm .
have war parties been raiding you?
is that what's happened here?
the damp in this place , it gets evil cold in the bones .
the indians told the company this was a bad place to build a fort , but they didn't listen .
so where is everyone?
the trade party was supposed to return with supplies two months ago .
it's two months ... and still no sign of them .
so there's no passage east then?
except on foot .
for a few thousand miles .
this was geoffrey's room .
wallace's son .
where is he?
he died ... a few weeks ago .
these are for you .
i hope they fit all right .
they were wallace's wife's .
she was a beautiful indian girl .
she died too .
it was quite tragic .
here's the key .
i'll see you at dinner then .
hmm .
what a lovely shade of dead .
is a dead boy's room the only one they've got?
it's better than sleeping in the woods with a tree root for a pillow .
we've slept there before .
together forever?
together forever .
ladies .
we should eat here more often .
there's two chairs for you here .
chief factor , the blessing .
yes , of course .
it wouldn't be dinner if the almighty didn't join us .
bless us , father , for these thy gifts of plenty which we are about to receive .
and verily ... verily i say unto thee ,
let us not succumb to the temptations of the flesh , but rather remain chaste .
the faithful shall kneel on bleeding shins ...
amen .
amen .
scripture has twisted that man deadly .
and you ... you watch it .
he's fixing on you .
enjoy it while it lasts .
there won't be much more for any of us soon .
supplies will get through .
we just to have hold out until then .
i wanna make a toast ... a toast to our magnificent indian friend here .
we had scouts like you in my regiment out east ... yes , which was a good thing .
'cause in the front line they took a musket ball
like a sandbag .
seven footer , good 300 lbs .
on him ...
wallace does good to keep him here .
hunter like him could kill anywhere .
what keeps him here?
something he's not telling .
no , you're waiting for something .
what is it?
got some kind of blood brothers out there?
they work us from the outside and you , redskin , work us from the inside?
easy , easy !
easy .
put it away ...
i am my own .
i stay because it is my will to stay .
and until they get you ... remember that it was a redskin's will that you even breathed your stink that long .
gentlemen .
we stand on the brink of darkness ... and the color of our gods has nothing whatsoever to do with it .
we have to abandon this place .
the company will understand .
they're just wooden walls .
wooden walls?
every man that has ever walked on this mortal earth ... has walked here with us .
and we stand as far as they've ever come .
it's these wooden walls that shelter every rome ever built .
this battle's every war ever won .
and that fire out there ... every light that's held back the dark .
dinner is over .
good christian women need fear nothing .
we're not afraid .
oh yes , you are .
two months this fort has been in the devil's grip , and you two little girls walk right through our door .
what is that?
demons .
the devil's wickedness .
this place is to be drowned like a newborn deformity , to be cut out like a bleeding cancer , to be cast into hell like a stinking whore !
don't forget to say your prayers , ladies .
these people are fucked .
ginger , come look at this .
these toys must be geoffrey's .
who's there?
hello?
hello?
come over here .
i'm not going to hurt you .
wake up .
brigitte , wake up .
get dressed .
we're leaving .
i was dreaming ...
mother and father were there .
mother and father are dead .
you're bleeding .
what have you done?
what have i done?
something bit me !
something bit you?
yes .
i thought it was a boy .
it was some kind of animal ... it was deformed .
it's loose in the house .
brigitte , please get up .
where are we going to go?
same place we always go ... away .
stop .
did you hear that?
help me .
ah , come here .
get up ... so i can rattle your pretty mouth again .
oh , you're gonna do just fine .
come on .
come on .
don't move .
step back .
do it .
she won't .
i won't?
no , you won't .
you may have the gun , but you don't have the stones .
owen , finn !
get down here !
they're on top of us !
we're coming !
help me !
owen !
tabarnac !
oliver !
don't let me go , finn !
don't let me go !
no !
don't let them get me !
let him go !
get the beam , finn !
this way !
seamus !
pull !
come on !
fuck .
shh !
shh !
there's one inside .
shh !
it ripped through the wall .
this way .
go .
get inside .
quickly !
en nomini patri , et fili , et spiritus sancti ...
burn in hell .
it's in here with us .
be quiet .
run .
run !
close the door !
close the door !
break the window , brigitte !
go away !
help up here !
somebody help us !
you bastard .
what are you two girls doing out of your room?
are you all right?
no .
your " man of god " locked us in with one of those things !
monsieur rowlands !
we need more men on the walls .
how many are there?
they're everywhere .
up the tower ... shoot whatever you see .
reverend , be useful !
stand a post .
he tried to kill us .
you two , to your room !
it has begun .
the black and the red .
what is it?
oh shit .
oh god .
i'm burning up .
just leave it .
it's fine .
i've bled before .
not without being hit .
what are they , ginger?
animals?
that was no animal .
could they really be ...
what , demons come for us sinners?
it looks septic .
they've got the place surrounded .
god help us !
brigitte?
brigitte?
hmm .
what have you done to my sister?
what will you do to your sister?
thank you .
one sister kills the other ...
brigitte?
brigitte !
oh god .
we need to see dr. murphy .
the air is bloody .
kill the boy .
mr. murphy?
we need you to ...
what's the matter , finn?
uh , nothing .
i'm fine .
shh !
it's just these leeches .
they can't be trusted .
go on .
answer the girl , finn .
tell her what you're doing .
me?
i'm ... just killing these leeches here .
you got bit last night , didn't you , finn?
no .
no , i didn't .
i did real good last night .
i'm sure i ... shot the one that took owen , and i'm real sure ... not one of them even ... so much as touched me .
you know me , murphy .
i'm fit as a fiddle most of the time .
i know , finn .
you're a real good boy .
but you gotta listen to me now .
put the knife down .
now , get yourself a leech .
do it , boy .
now put it on you .
do it , finn .
no , not on your arm .
on your chest .
please , murphy .
i just wanna go home .
yeah , me too , son .
we're almost there .
get me out of here .
now , what can i do for you two ladies?
what the hell's going on , murph?
finn got bit .
i put him down .
we can't keep doing this !
he was no damn sick dog .
he was bit .
and when they're bit , they turn .
just like this one here did .
wait a minute .
that's jean pierre's mark , isn't it , claude?
no , you're wrong .
it's not my brother's .
it's the same mark .
it's what happened to the boat crew .
it's them turned .
no , tab !
it's him .
who is jean pierre?
jean pierre is claude's brother , head of the boat crew .
they were supposed to return with provisions two months ago .
they left in the spring , and they haven't come back .
there's been no sign of them .
we need to know .
you need to know .
check the eye .
angels and ministers of grace defend us .
glass .
it's him .
they're all dead .
or turned into these sieging monsters .
what's more ...
jean pierre used to bunk up there where the hunter killed him .
it's the last thing they remember ... trying to come home .
it is time for us to confess our sins ... beg for his mercy .
and what good will that do us?
can you not see we're reaping what we've sown?
we've brought this upon ourselves .
i'm sure i'm going to hell for this , but shut your holy fucking mouth .
that's it .
we pack up , we get the hell out of here .
we move at night .
we rest during the day .
if the hunter leads us ...
no savage is leading me anywhere .
you don't have to come .
i'm sick of your bile !
you're the one fathering their whelps .
i'm going to rip your filthy tongue out of your skull !
seamus !
none of it makes any difference .
the hunter to guide us , we'll be taking down him with us .
we've no choice , do you understand?
come on , ginger .
this is the fight !
and if it's to be fought here , then so be it .
i've lost my wife to it .
i've lost my son to it .
let them come .
he's lying to them .
his son's not dead .
that was him that bit me .
he's still lives in the house .
he's turning into one of those creatures .
so am i.
no ...
i can smell their blood .
yours too .
be quiet .
stop , just stop .
shh .
oh god .
when we were boys in france , my grandfather told my brother and i of le loup garou ... man transformed into wolf .
on the full moon , it preyed on the shepherds ... and travelers near his village .
the old men warned us ... beware its bite , or we might become a slave to the full moon too .
it gave me bad dreams ...
but my brother said ,
don't worry , claude , if it bites you , you won't become one .
because i will help you catch it , so you can kill it before you turn ... and the spell will be broken .
it was a long time ago ... and we were just little boys .
god's forgiveness and mercy for his children is boundless .
those lost in battle with evil shall find glory in the fields of heaven .
he has brought peace and eternal rest upon the souls of finn mclntyre and owen crisp .
but verily i say unto thee , those that court sin shall be lost to the fire .
they shall become the very armies of the beast .
no longer can we flout god .
no longer can we give refuge to the evil amongst us .
no longer can we cast our seed into the dusky heathen bitch .
for he who was cast down into the fire is upon us , and his name is legion for he is many !
come on , boy .
i can't find my mother .
i've looked and looked .
i miss mine too .
it itches .
geoffrey , wait .
your end .
lift .
okay .
let me look at it .
how is it?
it's fine .
it's getting better .
i'm going to get something for the pain .
there's nothing you can do .
brigitte , where's your sister?
resting .
the excitement ... she can sometimes be a little ... frail .
she's all right?
she let geoffrey out .
the others don't know he's alive .
you saw them out there .
they'd kill him .
what happened to him?
my wife and he were attacked .
she was killed .
he had been bitten .
for a while it seemed he might recover .
but then he began to change into one of them .
every day i look into his eyes and i see less and less my little boy .
can you imagine what that's like?
you look after your sister .
geoffrey?
kill the boy .
that was the boy who bit me .
i have to kill him ...
if i ... if i kill him ... just like she said ,
i kill the boy and the curse'll be lifted .
milo?
milo?
seamus?
seamus?
it was just here .
jesus christ .
i've got something for you .
you can wear it in a locket .
hmm ...
quiet !
okay , get her out !
get her out of here !
quiet !
oww !
it isn't a wolf bite , is it?
no ...
get a good bite , little bitch .
good and deep .
ahh ...
oh god !
no !
oh god !
stand away from the girl .
now get out .
mr. rowlands .
i'll get you , boy .
they're going to kill my sister .
geoffrey bit her , didn't he?
she's turning .
yes .
then it's too late .
is it too late for your son?
i'll tell them about geoffrey .
i swear it .
they kill my sister , they kill your son .
hold her still !
get a leech .
let her go !
you heard her .
let her go .
she killed seamus !
bled out his throat .
she never left the room .
i swear it !
she never left her sister's side .
leech the witch !
reverend ...
i suggest you lower your weapon , or i will , by god , introduce you to him .
this plague has come because of your love for your savage wife .
it is your sin that has brought the devil upon us .
my sin is something you can only dream about .
leech her .
it's the only way we're gonna know .
murphy , don't .
you're insane .
no one touches either of these two without my order .
is that understood?
get out !
it's all right .
it's all right .
pack your things .
you're making us leave?
not you .
you can stay .
she goes .
brigitte , i have to break the curse .
we go ... we go together .
i have to kill geoffrey .
i'm not staying here without you .
there's no other way .
he must die by my hand .
i don't know where we'll go , but we'll go together .
brigitte , look at me .
there's got to be something .
some other way , something we don't know about .
brigitte , look at me !
i'm turning into something dangerous .
you know it's true .
you heard the old woman .
you're the only thing i have .
nothing else .
i will not kill you .
forever ... nothing else .
i love you , brigitte .
no !
no !
no , no !
no one left to protect you , little half breed .
your father's throat's out !
let me go !
get the gate !
you're going out , like the dirty little mongrel mutt you are !
no !
please no !
get up !
get out !
get the beam .
geoffrey?
shh , it's all right .
you miss her , don't you?
i'm sure she misses you too .
there's something in the graveyard !
run !
where is she?
she's gone .
it's too dangerous for you here .
what do you want?
i've known you before i found you in the woods .
since i was a boy , i've seen your face in dreams .
i've prepared my whole life to meet with you .
the dreams told me to protect you .
and kill my sister .
if i wanted to kill either of you ,
i could've , many times .
i am forbidden to kill her .
the seer believes our fates are tied together .
you know the old woman?
she's an elder with sight .
come with me and she will show us the truth .
i'm waiting for my sister .
she's one of them .
i've hunted this creature's bloodline for years .
they live only to kill !
i'm staying until my sister comes back .
watch her carefully .
soon not even her love for you will stop her .
wallace !
wallace !
they found the boy .
what is that?
it's wallace's boy .
he's alive .
and he's turned .
turned ugly .
wallace come out here .
having a little reunion .
wallace , get out here !
wallace !
good news , chief .
your boy's back from the dead .
you've been telling us lies !
he's my son , he's my responsibility .
he's not your son anymore .
look at him !
you fucked us .
you haven't just killed murphy .
you killed everyone here .
it's my concern .
what about murphy's concern?
and owen's?
and finn's?
he killed seamus .
for good or bad , i'm in command !
well , i think it's time that changed .
son ...
look at me .
take him !
no !
i couldn't do it , brigitte .
i couldn't kill him , now it's too late .
i'm afraid , brigitte .
it's over .
mutiny's over .
and that one?
she's leaving .
we two owe each other nothing .
say your goodbyes .
we have to find the old woman .
we'll take our chances and travel by day in the woods .
it's better than staying here .
we wait until the watch changes , and then we go out the way the beast got in .
by the time they come for you , we'll already be gone .
keep pulling !
therefore the curse is brought upon us .
i'm cold .
i'm not .
we have to keep moving .
ginger !
we have to find the hunter .
he'll take us to the seer ...
shhh , shh .
what is it?
someone's watching us .
hello?
milo .
i know you're afraid , but can you help us find the hunter?
his cave is up the river .
take us to him .
can you do that?
we're very close .
what do you hear?
they're stalking us .
wendigo .
this way , hurry !
milo , wait !
milo?
milo?
ginger?
ginger?
brigitte , i couldn't help it .
i did it .
you need to leave me .
come on , come on .
brigitte ...
i'll kill you .
i'll kill you .
come on , ginger , up !
there ... the cave .
that's the place .
shh , it's all right .
no , it's over .
it's over , we're dead .
we're dead .
we're not dead , we're here .
we've come this far .
in my mother ...
i heard you coming .
tell us how to cure this .
i warned you .
it's too late .
the curse is in the blood .
kill the boy before he bit you .
please help us .
tell us what to do .
the english and the french brought with them their diseases to plague our land .
and with them came the wendigo .
this was all foretold , watched for .
and with the wendigo would come two sisters , the red and the black .
and their love and their deaths would decide the way of things .
i'm gonna kill you , brigitte .
no , you won't .
she won't kill me ,
i know it .
snow .
she is offering you " machya buwat moon .
the night and the day come into you and your spirit runs forward .
you will see things .
will i see what happens to us?
you will see your death .
but will i find the answer?
snow .
don't do this , brigitte .
i need to know .
it is believed amongst our people that those who lived always live .
do not fear death .
i love you , brigitte .
gin gerr !
no !
ginger !
ginger?
what happened?
she killed the seer .
i went in to protect you and she ripped out her throat .
now tell me what you saw .
tell me !
i didn't see my death .
i saw ginger's .
and it was you that killed her , wasn't it?
it's what i saw .
and what did you see?
i saw myself die .
i give my life to save you ... so that you can kill her .
it's still her .
we will be together .
she will come back to me .
she has to die by your hand .
and what if i don't?
what if i don't kill her?
she dies by your hands , or you die by hers and the land suffers forever as foretold .
i just want my sister back .
you saw this knife .
i know you saw it .
i killed ginger with it .
this is the only way .
you have no choice .
it is your path .
do not fear death .
we go to the fort and wait for her .
she will come for you there .
the prodigal has returned .
welcome back .
you bastard !
in this mortal life , it is not just our physical bodies which hang in the balance .
it is an eternity of peace , and it is this forgiveness which i offer you .
take it , child .
for the lost soul of your sister , take it .
i have seen things ... in dreams and in waking ... about the way things will be for her and i.
and in these dreams , reverend ... you are screaming for your life , you prick !
she's coming for me .
witch !
temptress !
one , two ...
disciple of the devil !
no longer will your evil tempt us . three ... four , five ...
if you will not beg for mercy , mercy shall be inflicted upon you .
wait !
the other will come .
let the bitch in .
you were born of the fire ...
37 ... and to the fire you shall return .
i've come for my sister .
i'm sorry to tell you , but the reverend has taken a real fancy to saving her from hellfire .
so i guess that leaves me and you more or less to ourselves .
right then .
burn her , wallace , while there's still time .
burn her !
you hit like a girl .
well , we've got all night to fix that .
you've let a pair of little girls destroy us .
you never could see how they lied and tricked and tempted you into oblivion , man , just like that bitch wife of yours .
forgive me , father ... for i have sinned .
48 ...
have you had enough?
huh?
you finished yet?
or does your pretty little mouth have something more to say?
let's hear it !
come closer .
it's a secret .
watch her !
68 ...
she's come back for you .
stay close to the fire .
98 ...
99 ...
100 .
ginger?
behind you !
you know how it must end .
together forever .
ginger !
i was wrong to leave you , brigitte .
but you came back .
ginger?
i'm cold .
i'm not .
the day of reckoning ... the day the curse grew stronger in the red and the black .
sisters united in blood , together forever .
