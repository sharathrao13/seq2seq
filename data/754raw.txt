mr. popper , what is my policy on ringing phones in the classroom?
i'm sorry , sir .
yes , well ... ... you're barely passing my class as it is , mr. popper .
it won't happen again , sir .
for your sake , i hope not .
i turned it off .
i know i did .
they know you know .
they're coming for you .
get out .
get out now !
you are in serious trouble , mr. popper .
stop right there !
mr. popper .
neo , i believe .
i know it wasn't a dream .
this is not real .
and the real world lies somewhere else .
a typical mental delusion .
we get unbalanced kids like this all the time .
reality can be a pretty scary thing for some people .
this world must have been a cold and alienating place for a boy like that .
it's called denying reality .
it's , you know , just a self defense mechanism for those type of kids .
well , he's in another world now .
make no mistake about that .
his vitals are good .
he's gonna make it .
it's unbelievable .
i didn't think self substantiation was possible .
apparently , it is .
neo .
it's okay .
you're safe now .
i knew ... ... you'd save me .
i didn't save you , kid .
you saved yourself .
