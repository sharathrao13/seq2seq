they're trying to kill him .
we gotta do something !
thank you , wanda .

why haven't they found him yet?
i'm a murderer .
i'm a dirty murderer .
i should be punished .

lance .
call the cops .
call the cops .

call the cops .
9 1 1 .
9 1 1 .
you're damn right i was mad !
mamacita , nueve ,
i had tickets to go see the o'jays . uno , uno .
nueve , uno , uno .
where's the phone?
where's the phone?
no can do , lance .
the phone company doesn't provide service to dead people .
you wanna make a call , get a body .
well , find me another body .
i don't want anything to do with these freaks .
i am here to see mr. wellington , and i'm not leaving until i see him .
allow me to speak to mr. wellington .
yes , you let him know i'm here .
mr. sklar , sir?
yeah , cisco?
it's , uh , miss jenkins again , sir .
she insists on seeing mr. wellington .
i'm sorry to bust in like this .
well , actually i'm not .
that's her .
that's the girl .
hey , remember me?
on the bike .
run over?
no , that's allright , miss jenkins .
so , what can we do for you?
well , i just wanted to say that i think that you should be arrested .
holy crap .
what you're planning to do to the brooklyn community hospital is downright criminal .
oh , so you mean that
you throw those words around like that .
arrested . " it kind of hit me .
that really ooh !
i don't think there's anything funny about this .
i work at the brooklyn community hospital .
and it's the only public health facility in the area , and your company just bought it .
i know that hospital .
my uncle went there for a new liver .
they sent his ass to the supermarket .
if this hospital goes private , the people who depend on us ... they won't have any place to turn .
that's awful .
i think you should take that up ... with mr. wellington at his business office .
i've tried that .
i've been there at least 20 times .
i've made 200 phone calls , and mr. wellington seems to never be in , so i decided to visit him at his home .
well , he's unavailable , i guarantee you .
if he's unavailable now , i'll just wait here until he is available .
i'm afraid you can't .
yes , i can .
would you like to call the police and have me arrested?
i'm sure the press'll be interested in the story .
no , no , no .
let's don't .
let's don't even  i thought so .
hey , king , if i take this wellington guy's body , could i help her out?
you got the hots for her .
you tryin 'to sell me a body , right?
well , let's see it .
okay .
would you stop it?
this ain't star trek .
i'm used to walking .
lance barton , charles wellington .
mr. wellington , please , don't get up .
damn , he's dead !
yep .
nice bathtub .
so if i take his body , i'm gonna look like that , right?
i can't go to the apollo in that body .
how am i supposed to get laughs lookin 'like him?
he looks funny to me .
i already get booed .
do i really need to get beat down on top of it?
you want to meet the girl , you gotta take the body .
any moment someone'll discover it , and it'll be too late .
does it have to be for good?
could i just be him while you find me a better body?
you mean , take the body on loan?
mm hmm .
normally , i have a problem with that , but since we , uh , screwed up ,
it's a deal .
mr. wellington , there's a miss sontee jenkins here to see you .
still bathing , are we?
we don't want our fingers to go all pruney .
hey , it worked !
what?
you weren't sure it would work?
relax , i read the manual .
hey , i still look like me .
you are you .
i thought you said i was wellington .
you are wellington .
well , thanks for clearin 'that up .
look , lance , to everyone else ... you look like wellington , you sound like wellington , you even smell like wellington .
but you see yourself .
simple , huh?
mr. wellington , is everything allright?
go ahead .
you can answer him .
go ahead .
everything's cool .
not too cool , i hope .
no , everything is all right .
now , when i go out there , they're gonna see wellington , not some brother in his clothes .
'cause i don't feel like gettin 'shot today .
you'll be all right .

you have been avoiding me for weeks , and you're gonna listen to exactly what i have to say .
me?
i am talking about people's lives here , mr. wellington .
sick people , poor people .
the kind of people that you care nothing about .
these people are going to be in desperate trouble ... if you sell them out from the only place they can go when they need help .
see you later , lance .
i'll get keyes workin 'on a new body .
good luck .
hey , but  but nothing !
do you know that we are the only county hospital in that part of brooklyn?
and you chose there of all places ... to privatize and kick sick , broke people out on their behinds .
what kind of man are you?
it sounds like i'm an asshole .

no , i do not think this is a joke .

i thought maybe we could ... get in the rolls and go by the four seasons , have a little brunch , discuss this whole hospital thing .
oh , so you're trying to impress me with the car and the money .
you think i'm some video ho?
look , i really don't care what you have , okay?
if you want to impress me , do it at the board meeting on monday .
i thought maybe we could spend some time together .
why don't you spend a little time and do something positive with your money?
that was brutal .
you got a nice touch with the ladies .
i can't get a girl in this body , and i definitely can't get any laughs .
have you found me anything yet?
i'm workin 'on it .
i was just in havana .
you want one?
no , i don't want one .
what i want from you is a body that works .
i want a body , and i want it now !
what , are you gettin 'tough with me?
i'm a friggin 'angel .
you don't want to be in heaven , you don't like it here .
there is a third option , you know .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
i just need a body .
you know what?
there's a big rap concert in the bronx tonight .
somebody's gonna die .
hey , don't forget about me .
go to the rap concert .
it's over between you and me .
i can't do this anymore .
let's just get out of here .
we could take the plane .
we could go someplace he'll never find us .
chechnya , east timor .
it'll be fun .
no , i can't .
i mean , after all , he is my husband , and i love him .
and i'm gonna do whatever i can to get him back .
bitch !
scaming , double crossing bitch !
that's sweet , winston , but it's too late .
we cannot allow wellco to take over !
i just think this is an extremely bad time ... to be making a personal appearance .
i've been lookin 'into this hospital thing , and i think sontee jenkins had a point
let's just handle this the usual way , okay?
you do the strong , silent thing .
i'll field all the questions .
i'm the velvet glove .
you're the iron fist .
i won't let you down .
we can't have that .
no !
there's one man that's responsible for all this charles wellington .
you're a bad man !
get outta here !
leave our hospital alone !
scumbag !
white oppressor !
mr. wellington , now that you own brooklyn community hospital , are you gonna be sending those without health insurance ... to public facilities outside their own community?
yeah , asshole !
mr. wellington doesn't have time ... to answer any questions right now .
let me address that .
i don't care what you got .
cancer , rickets , polio , swine flu , the clap , dandruff
what else you got?
lyme disease .
lyme disease , lemon disease .
it don't matter .
we'll take you .
liar !
won't take you .
mr. wellington , is the
thank you .
thank you all .
well , here they are , mr. wellington , the faces that you were too much of a coward to confront .
so what do you have to say to them?
hey , what's up , wheelie?
crutchie crutch , how you doin ', man?
hey , big i. v. save me a sip .
i want a sip , now .
i know what's wrong with you .
your breath is destroying the environment .
why don't you tell them that you don't care about them?
while you're at it , how come you locked the staff and press out of this meeting?
you know what?
i must've been out of my mind .
was i takin 'ecstasy that day?
we goin 'in there .
sklar , grab a stretcher .
we're goin 'in .
everybody .
allright !
if you can walk , let's walk .
if you can't walk , it's time to roll .
if you got crutches , then crutch your ass in there .
we are goin 'in .
come on , big i. v. let's do this .
whoo .
sorry , brother .
can we get some more juice for big i. v.?
hey , guys , i brought us some friends from the media .
so if anybody is not where they're supposed to be ... or with somebody they're not supposed to be with ... or got a little crust in their eyes , you might want to get up right now .
you can't bring news cameras into the boardroom .
hey , relax .
we got nothing to hide .
if there's not enough seats , you can just sit on somebody's lap , unless the person next to you don't got a lap .
so , what's up?
mr. wellington , at your hospital in kentucky , a teenager with a bullet wound to his head was sent to another hospital ... 15 miles away , dying en route .
hey , hey , hey , hey .
hospitals don't kill people .
people kill people .
what kind of cold ass shit is that?
we can't be sendin 'people out with bullet wounds to their head .
that's somethin 'you definitely have to take serious .
from now on , we got a new slogan .
shot in the head , you get a bed ! " .
okay?
if your head is bloody , we're your buddy .
i want bullet wounds in this place to be treated like cash accepted everywhere .
but not without adequate insurance .
not without adequate insurance .
is insurance really adequate?
when you pay for insurance , do you feel assured?
they shouldn't even call it insurance .
they should just call it " in case shit " .
i give a company some money in case shit happens .
now , if shit don't happen , shouldn't i get my money back?
wouldn't that be fair?
if i had known y'all was gonna keep the money , i would've got in an accident .
and if you're gonna take my money , at least spend the money on some poor , sick people .
don't take my money and buy a mercedes benz ... and park it in front of brooklyn hospital ... with all these broke people gotta walk by it .
i just got off the b 44 bus , and i got to look at your mercedes benz?
i should just stab the tire !
and why do doctors cost so much?
do you know?
shut the hell up !
it's like doctors chargin 'all this money for a triple bypass surgery .
triple bypass surgery gonna charge somebody $100, 000 ... and then got the nerve to say , " take it easy .
shit , i gotta go get a job right now drivin 'another cab or somethin '... just to pay off the damn doctor !
from now on , we have to be different .
let's see how it feels to not be the evil corporation anymore .
let's try takin 'in people bleedin 'with bullet wounds to the head .
let's just try it for a change .
i mean , we tried the other way .
we made a lot of money .
we got paid .
we got laid .
and so what if we lose a few million dollars?
now , a lot of y'all look pretty pissed off .
look like y'all want to get froggy .
well , come on !
what you gonna do?
uh uh .
you see this foot?
you see this foot?
it's from a little town called " rich man's ass " , and it's gettin 'homesick .
you guys have been great .
you've been a lovely audience .
i want to thank y'all for showin 'up .
drive home safely .
tip your waitresses .
i gots to go .
take care .
thanks a lot .
thank you .

i'm sorry to jump in , but are you hungry?

so what'd you do?

i wore that coat the whole summer .
july 4th , i was on the beach with a goose down and a pair of shorts .

different good or different weird?
it was a little bit of both , i think .
i guess you just didn't seem like my type .
not your type .
so , uh , what's your type look like?
it's not all about looks .
i mean , you don't have to be fine or anything .
i just kind of like a guy with all of his teeth .
well , that's a good rule .
that's a good rule .
i like a slim guy .
a guy with a goatee .

i mean , if i get with you , great .
but if not , at least somebody'll be happy .

i think they played the lakers or somebody
i'm sorry .

no , it's i knew you were gonna try to kiss me tonight , and i thought i'd be mad , but i'm not .
it's it's somethin 'about your eyes .
you know , the first kiss ... is always in the middle of a sentence .
it's always like , " yeah , tomorrow i'm gonna go to the zoo , because i got this whole thing with orangutans , and i just
or ... it could be like , um , " did you hear about that new war in russia?
i heard they were gonna

hey !

what are you , the great gazoo?
sorry .
hi .
how are you?
i got a new body for you .
i don't need the body anymore .
this one's just fine .
mr. barton , we have about one minute to get you into this truly fabulous corpse .
hey , i'm cool with wellington .
you know why?
'cause sontee's cool with wellington .
look , i just waited through ol 'dirty bastard , mystikal and silkk the shocker for you .
keeping this body is not an option , regardless of whether you're smitten with some girl .
it's not some girl .
it's the girl .
i mean , you got heaven , but you don't got this , man .
she's fine .
she's smart .
we like all the same stuff .
we hate all the same stuff .
she laughs at my stupid jokes .
and i don't have to censor myself around her .
but you know what?
she only knows me as this guy wellington .
so i don't want to up and change now .
lance , trust me , it's better this way .
yo , money , gimme your wallet .
one second .
are you sure i won't die for 40 years?
technically , yes  mother
but this body's just a loaner !
boy , nobody listens to me .
come on , man !
rob me !
don't run !
i got money !
you bad !
what does that mean , he wants to be more involved with running the company?
it means , uh ... he wants to be more involved ... with , uh , running ... the company .
i thought you had him under control .
i do .
i mean , i did .
i don't really know where this came from .
it's like he's gone crazy .
maybe the fact you were shtupping his wife changed his attitude a little .
there's really no need to get , uh , personal .
i'll tell you what i take personally : the statement , " what if we lose a few million dollars?
i didn't get into this business to lose money .
do you think this goody two shoes crap that wellington's been spewing ... extends to , say , auditing the company's finances?
jesus , i hope not .
blah , blah , blah .
let's just kill him .
what are you laughing about?
winston , do you want to take the lead on this one?
cisco , you know what i need you to do?
i need you to get in contact with a man named whitney daniels .
he lives on 104th and lennox .
tell him i need to talk to him .
uh
pretty sweet , huh?
up here , mr. daniels .
entering second floor .
yeah .
yeah , yeah .
i saw this girl the other day .
she was ugly .
she's so ugly , she's talkin 'about give her a booty call .
i said , " girl , you so ugly , i'm gonna give you a zootie call .
what the hell do you think you're doing here , huh?
this isn't your act .
calm down .
hey , hey , hey !
everybody , whitney daniels !
shut up !
you guys have been great , but we're gonna take a little break right now .
all right .
come on , everybody .
let's get back to work .
come on .
what the hell is going on here?
i know it looks kind of crazy , but if i'm gonna get ... an amateur spots at the apollo , i'm gonna need a place to work out .
y you wanna do one of the amateur spots at the apollo?
you?
what do you do , have your butlers ... hang around comedy clubs and steal people's acts?
you think my act is stolen?
i know it is .
personally , i would have stolen some better material .
but the kid who wrote it , he used to work it pretty well and
two rheingolds comin 'at ya .
thanks a lot , cisco .
damn , you took everything from the kid , huh?
don't tell me that rheingold is all you can afford , mr. wellington .
whit , i didn't steal anything .
i just want to play the apollo , and you're the only man who can help me do it .
no .
i'm out of the comedy business .
last person i was gonna help is dead .
but , anyway , he was a special case .
really?
what was so special about him?
about him?
nothin ', really , if you want to know .
he didn't have much talent to speak of .
but no matter how bad it went and , believe me , sometimes it went really bad he wanted to get back onstage .
he was a good kid .
and i wanted to be there when things got good for him , but
but i guess that won't happen now .
thanks for the beer .
whitney , it's me lance .
uh i got hit by a truck , and i went up to heaven , and they took my body quick .
and i'm in heaven , and it's all blue .
and this guy and then the other guy , mr. king , he looked like ricky ricardo and
i don't know if it's drugs you're takin 'or drugs you need to be takin ', but do something .
whitney , remember when we did that gig in atlantic city?
they were supposed to pay us 500 , but they only gave us 250 .
and we got real drunk and hung out with these two girls .
we got so drunk , we thought they was transvestites .
turns out they weren't transvestites .
they were just two real ugly girls .
then we brought 'em back to the hotel , hung out with 'em , fell asleep .
when we woke up , what did we find out?
they robbed us !
yeah , man !
they
booey !
yeah !
whoo !
th this is impossible .
what's so impossible about it?
you been going to church your whole life .
you've been putting money in the collection plate every week .
this is just your tax dollars at work .
wait a minute .
god
what's god like?
does he have a sense of humor?
i haven't met god , but the devil got some good weed .
i'm just joking .
just playin ', man .
i haven't even met him yet , but i met this guy , mr. king .
he's kind of like the manager up there .
manager?
wait
lance .
just because you built a comedy club in your own home , it doesn't mean you can pull this off .
you gotta work your material in front of a real audience .
i got an audience .
you heard me gettin 'laughs .
you ain't my type but i think i like you
doin 'just fine but i think i like you
you ain't the right height but i think i like you
wasn't love at first sight but i think i like you
they say you're kinda rude but i think i like you
i don't like your crew but i think i like you
what else do we got?
your mother has so much hair under her arms , it looks like she has buckwheat in a headlock .
i don't know why but i think i like you
you ain't my type but i think i like you
you know what i like about telling jokes?
it's pure .
it's like boxing 101 .
you versus the audience .
it's not like music .
nobody cares what you look like .
nobody cares what you're wearing .
people just want to know if you're funny .
can you bring it?
and i just wanna go to the apollo and bring it one time .
what about that stuff you were saying at the hospital?
people think that stuff every day , but you never hear anybody say it .
i was just talkin '.
yeah , but it worked .
what do you mean , worked?
it was funny .

you know , sometimes when i can't find you ,
i call your house just to listen to your answering machine ... because i love your voice .
the cars , the money , all this stuff , i'd give it all up just for you .
you know , today i changed the diaper of an 86 year old man , and i'd give it all up just for you .

yes , you can take your hands down .
so you really want to get married?
i really want to get married .
i mean , just look at me .
you know i'm not lying .
i know .
there's something about your eyes .
sontee , i just want to remember all of this .
i don't want you to forget me .
you're not gonna forget me , right?
you act like something's gonna happen .
nothing's gonna happen .
i'm just saying , though , if something did happen ,
like ... someday you met a guy
it could be a black guy , a white guy , a spanish guy .
i mean , if he was sincere , you'd give him a shot , right?
wait a minute .
wait a minute .
what are you talking about?
everything's all right .
everything's all right .
so you brought the big gun , huh?
you gotta play by the rules like everybody else .
i played by the rules my whole life , and i'm sick of it .
from now on , i make the rules .
no one makes these rules .
but you make all the mistakes .
every time i get something going , you take my body .
this was just a temporary setup .
the clock ran out .
i'm not scared of you , king .
i got lawyers now .
i got money .
makes no difference .
but i can't go now .
i'm supposed to play the apollo , and i'm in love .
this is bigger than that .
nothin's bigger than that .
this is fate .
how come every time something bad happens to me , it's fate , and every time something good happens to me , it's luck?
is anything good supposed to happen to me?
no .
somebody call 9 1 1 !
sorry , lance .
i tried to warn you .
king , you gotta get me back .
no dice .
we had a deal .
i'll do anything .
i'll be anybody .
there'll be consequences .
i'll take 'em .
just get me back !
hello , sontee .
i just can't believe he's gone , just like that .
he's not gone , sontee .
i know in a way he's gonna live on , but
no , no , honestly .
you think you loved charles wellington , but really you loved someone inside of him .
he didn't die tonight .
he's living on somewhere .
i'm sure of it .
and he'll always remember us .
so what are we doin 'here?
this is your future , kid .
you mean i'm gonna be joe guy?
that's the plan .
i don't want to take his life .
he's about to play the apollo .
he's a nice guy .
that's his destiny .

the eccentric billionaire left the bulk of his estate to a number of city charities , his personal friends and his loyal domestic staff .
well , it's showtime at the apollo one last time ... as the venerable harlem institution closes its doors for good .

yeah !
so , what is it all about?
looks?
looks will determine everything .
you know , you want people to judge you by your character , you know , what you feel inside , but nobody cares .
people , all they care about is your looks .
i'm sorry , if you look good , you're gonna have a good life .
you look bad , ooh , you better work on it .
that's right , the uglier you are , the smarter you better be .
for every ten pounds you are overweight , you better pick up a book .

lance?
oh , yeah .
that's right .
i was at the knick game the other day .

the higher the seats got ,
the uglier the people got .
if i was a usher , i wouldn't even need tickets .
i'd just look at faces .

one thing i love about women .
women can fall in love with a ugly man and admit it .
show him off to all her friends and the family .
he'd be the ugliest guy in the world , and they'd be so proud of their ugly man .
they'll hold his hand like , " i want you to meet kevin .
i just want you to meet kevin .
he's a nice guy .
i know he don't look that good ... but he's good to me !
women cool like that .
guys would never admit to being in love with an ugly woman .

you wanna be in love .
you want that new love .
you want you want to feel that first kiss again .
that's right , 'cause that's the only real kiss in a relationship , is the first kiss .
all the rest of the kisses are just just protocol .
every other kiss is just protocol .
that's all it is , just routine .
hey !
you was gone .

hey , we havin 'sex .
hey , i miss you .
it's all routine .
the first kiss is the only real one ...
'cause it always happens , like , in the middle of a conversation .
you don't even know what you're talking about .
yeah , you know .

# i know one thing , police wouldn't always be watchin 'me #
# pullin 'me over for nothing constantly jockin 'me #
# yellow cabs in the city would stop for me #
# i wouldn't need collateral to buy property if i was white #
# wouldn't matter if i was rich or poor #
# security wouldn't follow me around the store like i'm gonna steal somethin '#
# because i'm black , i rob #
# and automatically assume i ain't got no job #
# on my own land feel like an immigrant #
# if i was white , i wouldn't have thought o. j. was innocent #
# if i was white , what if he was white what if he was white #
# yo , think about that for a minute # # what if he was white #
# wow # # what if he was white #
# what if he was white , white , white # # what if he was white #
# what if he was white # # what if he was black #
# what if he was white #
# what if he were white # # what if he was white , white , white #
# if i was white , it'd be a different world for me #
