mr. monk , i'm preparing some medication for you .

you could say that harald is .
yes , we're family .
he's boasting .
wait with that .
i want to be able to talk .
two minutes .
thank you very much .
what the hell , monk?
harald , my child .
my liver is giving up .
there's nothing to do .
i had always counted on getting shot .

i don't really feel like it anyway .
ls there anythingyou need?
no .
yeah ...
there may be one thing .
it's alittle complicated .
i would like to see my son .
you don't have a son .
oh yes i do .
i have a son .
you never mentioned it .
there was no reason to .
his mother was a stewardess , swedish .
crazy bitch .
i never got in touch .
i was in jail , so ...
i couldn't do anything .
he needs to see his dadwhile i'm still around .
that's obvious .
we'lljust find him .
where does he live?
ln sweden .
where does he live exactly?
ln sweden , you idiot .
where in sweden?
he's in jail .
what did he do?
nothing serious .
he's probably changed .

ludvig .
lf he's in jail , we can't ...
of course you can .
visiting hours are over .
you're smoking?
leave immediately !
we'll find him .
thank you , my boy .
it's not anormal prison .
it's for prisoners with life sentences .
they can't just give us a cookie .
i'm about to die of hunger .
it's impregnable . we've got to tell harald that we can't get him out .
stop kicking , you loser .
brat .
i'm sorry , butyou can't be here .
ls that lobster?
wouldyou go back to your seat?
how hadyou imagined we were going to get him out?
drive abulldozer through the wall .
but there are three walls .
real silverware and cloth napkins .
what the hell are you doing?
don't eat my crab .
go back to your seat .
what did he do?
he's in sweden's most heavily guarded prison .
it must have been parking tickets .
wouldyou go back to your seat?
i'm sorry , butyou can't be here .
stop it and go back to your seat .
lf you think about it ...
it might be that it's not completely impossible .
lf you kick me one more time ...
here comes another cake .
hi .
can i help you?
peter called and had some rooms set aside .
do you speak english?
martin , doesn't she speak danish?
we have made areservation for two rooms for mr. blixen .
ask if they have a conference room .
a conference room?
yes .
one with ablackboard .
why?
ask . lf he's had an idea , he'll tell us .
don't we have to land first?
then i'll ask .
just sign here for the rooms .
bitch .
come on .
come on , martin .
the keys ...
come on .
" meet room " ...
that's what it's called .
it's not called a " meet room " .
that's damn bad service .
peter is right .
she was abitch .
he just had amullet .
we'll meet in the conference room in two minutes !
tight security at the prison means the prisoners walk freely in the yard .
we're going to use that .
let's say you're the pear .
you come in here ...
let's back up alittle bit .
harald , this is you .
you walk into the yard and meet ludvig .
meanwhile martin and i are on the bridge , which is300 meters away .
lf we pretend this is the bridge , then that's martin and this is me .
we're standing looking into the prison yard .
we shoot awire300 meters down .
you click onto the wire .
you put on arappelling seat .
firstyou connect to the wire , and then to this basketball post .
then martin drives the truck down to the end of the bridge .
the truck is carrying a 1, 000 liter water deadweight .
so the wire is completely taut .
at the center of the wire is 7 1/ 2 meters of bungy cord .
release the wire , andyou'll fly over the wall and land under the bridge .
and martin and i will pick you up .
you don't really mean this , do you?
it's completely safe .
people pay 500 kroner to do it by the harbor .
get whatyou need and put the bottles back in the mini bar .
here .
martin , put it on .
can you see him?
there are alot of dogs .
they're crazy about dogs over here .
hold this a second .
it's the bungy .
ls he there?
no .
there he is .
the guy by the bench?
thank you very much .
hi .
i've come to getyou out .
leave me alone .
i think he's got him .
then you get this .
your father would like to see you .
i don't have a father .
fire !
guard !
what's happening , martin?
what's happening?
it's those dogs .
pull !
pull !
how was i to know the dogs would hold on?
let's get him up .
do we have to?
it's not my fault the dogs held on so tightly .
we go left next time .
are you sure?
it's anon stop train .
it arrives in 11 minutes .
how much does a doberman actually weigh?
ludvig !
hurry up .
come down here !
ln case someone sees you .
get lost !
what did he say?
he doesn't want to come down .
you've got to come home to denmark .
we're taking the bridge .
you haven't driven on ityet , have you?
come down .
show it to him .
it's apicture of your father , the monk .
you're father's really sick .
come on .
let me handle this .
that will give you abladder infection .

they've lied to you all these years .
come on .
we've brought a change of clothes for you .
ls it true?
ls it my father?
yes , it's your father .

shit , man .
ludvig , stop it !
that's not necessary .
i won't run away .

harald , there's somethingwrong with him .
can'tyou tell?
look at his eyes , he's crazy .
he's a great guy .
35sveteas for apiece of pastry .
where are we now?
a few hours ago , ludvig petterson , serving alife sentence , escaped .
he has been convicted of the murders of five women .
he is extremely dangerous .
lf you see this man  inform the police immediately .
what did they say?
he killed five women .
damn , harald .
they were probably really irritating .
sister , how long can it take?
harald ...
i don't want to talk about it .
let us eat in peace .
ludvig?
what are you doing?
she was talking on the phone and there was this gust of wind .
and then she fell .
get into the car !
sorry .
you've got so much hair and i've got so little .
it feels so strange .
i've so wished ...
well , that i had a father .
we kids always thought
that we had a father who was apilot or amillionaire .
i was apilot once .
and millions rolled in once .
so theoretically , i could have been a great father .
damn !
i didn't know that .
lf i had known that , you wouldn't have gotten ...
i wasn't what i should have been , but then i took care of harald .
can we go now?
let them get to know each other .
nice shirt .
ls there somethingwrongwith it?
it's nice .
i like it alot .

out of the question .
we just met .
yes ...
but that's how it is .
i think mr. monk needs to rest .
you've been here long enough .
ludvig , let go of her .
then give me five minutes .
you're not the only one that knows the monk .
don'tyou understand this is ahospital?

he looks like his mother .
i don't understand it . why don't they just give him anew liver?
because there are waiting lists .
we've got to do something .
i'll take care of that .
don't go wrecking everything .
i'll help the monk .
do you understand?
we'll call erling .
my doctor .

and on monday we'll get 1 million .
1 million .
that's alot of money .
shut up and fix that light .

have you forgotten your father is really sick?
shouldwe continue?
it's about a sealed money transport in aplane .
come in here and sit down !
a money transport in aplane .
this is a hercules .
send them round .
the monk , peter , martin and i are waiting in an ambulance .
he's the only one that can fly .
we can't fly aplane .
shut up .
erling gives the monk some morphine .
vuk checks in on another plane .
dk 603 to gran canaria .
there will be an accident .
the ambulance enters the apron .
ludvig , you will be in the first class lounge .
buy some tickets .
be creative .
think of somethingyourself .
we get in before the real ambulance comes .
this is the cool part .
we drive right down to the hercules .
we drive into the hercules , take out the guards and fly away .
what guards?
some rent a guards .
what the hell are you doing , vuk?
he's stillwired !
it's just a shoe !
can'tyou be more careful?
the hercules flies so low that they won't find us on radar .
you throw the money in the sea and jump after it .
vuk's uncles on a ship pick us up .
the hercules crashes .
have you ever had your noses licked?
the containers will sink . we can't jump out of aplane , can we peter?
yeah , well ...
can't we jump out of aplane?
there's plenty of air in the containers .
they won't sink .
a hercules only flies at 100 km an hour .
it's not dangerous to jump from .
the accident vuk causes ...
how do we do that?
well ... we'lljust think of something .
it's not aproblem .
a really ingenious plan .
really well thought up .
you never say anything .
what should i say?
it's okay .
boeing 737 300 .
they build them in seattle .

it won't work .
i don't know what's wrong .
sorry .

that's against the law .
it was in sweden .
what was your mother like?
good , i think .
i don't have anyone to compare her with .
she movedwhen i was twelve .
didn't she die when you were nine?
yes , she did .
you're so nice .
i thought of seeing apsychologist .
i don't know if it's necessary .
you shouldn't see apsychologist .
or i will too .
you're just shy .
you just need to relax .
i care aboutyou so much .
i thought about whatyou said about getting married .
dan promised to marry me all the time .
but i will .
do you want to?
stop it !
you shouldn't say it for fun .
look at me .
it's not funny .
wouldyou marry me?
