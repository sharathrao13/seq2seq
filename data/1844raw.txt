i'm a good person i'm a hard worker
my older sister is the only family i have
to put me through art school she gave up college and got a job at a factory
but then she fell seriously ill and had to quit
so i gave up art school and got a job
but recently i made a decision
i'm not sure whether to tell my sister or not
i'm hesitating even as i write this letter
if i decide to do it
i'll be listening to the broadcast with my sister
i can't speak with my mouth
i'm deaf and dumb
please read this letter to my sister for me , since i can't
sis , you're listening?
you told me if you die you want to be buried by the river where we used to play
all right i'll do that
but that'll be in 40 or 50 years 'time
i'm going to save you really , i swear
actually , i registered to donate my kidney today
i know you said not to that you'd rather die that you'd rather die than be a burden
but you know i never do what i'm told
not a type if the blood types don't match
then we can't do a transplant
you haven't had test since school , have you?
if you can't pay take her home for now
until we find a suitable donor just keep coming in for dialysis ok?
it's type b , b
our new house is an old house
the estate thought it'd be ok for i'm deaf
if sister can't sleep then neither can i
aw , fucking great !
i heard that this happened in australia
a man ... thought he had two heads
two heads?
yeah , two
and he kept getting headaches
with two heads he had headaches all the time
so you know what he did?
he shot one of his heads
the left or the right?
aren't you going to lunch?
come on
let's go eat something
you've only got 10 million won?
well , first of all give us your kidney then we'll do it
you give us yours and we'll get you one for your sister
for 10 million won got it?
understand me?
your blood type's b right?
21 days later congratulations
finding a donor this fast is simply a miracle
the surgery's in a week so have her admitted in 5 days
you said you had 10 million won , right?
so all your problems are solved
isn't it great?
you idiot you stupid fuck !
that money would've saved your sister
why not?
not the time to be thinking that way
there's a saying
is a boiled pig afraid of boiling water?
besides
what are you going to do?
you've only got a week
you know how long it'll take to find another donor?
is that her?
she's cute
must be a friend
that's the bastard who fired you?
that car's worth 10 years of your salary
that's why we need a revolution
so sick people will get free treatment
the time must come when you can get any damned organ you need !
the bad image they get is cause kids keep getting killed
but we're different
give us money , we'll return the kid pronto
i'm afraid she won't want to go home
she'll be playing with us all the time
won't have to go to school
what?
what?
it's summer vacation
but think about it from parents 'point of view
they'll be so happy to see her again
they'll love her more and the family will be closer we'll ask for exactly 26 million won
how conscientious is that right?
that money's nothing to them but for us it's a matter of life and death
movement of capital maximizes the value of money it's not a crime don't you think?
there are good kidnappings and bad kidnappings
good kidnapping enlists the parents 'cooperation
if they call the police , the kid dies
the parents pay up and the kid gets returned
then nobody finds out about it
people think all kidnappings are bad
daddy !
what?
can i go play at yoosun's house?
no
then will you buy me a cell phone like yoosun's?
why do you buy her stuff like that?
have consideration for your neighbors

the water's deep there it's far over my head
later i realized why i thought the water was deep
when i was a kid it was up over my head
have you ever done anything to provoke anyone?
please think again
i always thought
i lived an honest life
but think
excuse me , what is your net worth?
i'm a high school graduate and i started as an electrical engineer
my wife left me when the economy crashed
but why
i don't understand
why didn't you call the police?
i thought lots of kids returned safely
if i do what they tell me
sir , i checked it looks like they used this phone number they didn't answer so we can't locate them
it's this number right?
my wife gave it to her before she left
just a second
yeah
i'm working
so an operation will take care of it?
where would i get 10 million won?
am i supposed to do?
at least kid wasn't kidnapped and killed
we're lucky you know
cause we don't have any money

yoosun
why didn't you give me swimming lessons?
i put this house for sale and i sold the company , too
that's all
the money i have
there's nothing special about it
a brother and sister lived here
they don't know where they moved to
i'll look into it
let's go
nothing more to see here
you asked if i ever provoked anyone?
are you the father?
well , actually i am
how is he?
if i were a very optimistic doctor
i'd tell you there was hope this is my guess
when did you know we'd become like this?
the moment our eyes met
you're like an ant
an ant?
they say ants are psychic
they predict earthquakes and floods
