it's been quite a long while since my last confession .
we were getting shelled in the open .
and i confessed that i was frightened .
so i suppose i'm ....
i suppose i'm frightened now .
there was a king ... ... and he had a daughter ... ... and she was abducted .
he vowed to protect her , you see , but ... ... while he was indulging himself , shamefully ... ... she was abducted .
they tried to get her back and failed .
now , his advisors realized that if the girl returned ... ... it would reveal the king's shame to the country .
so they told him that she was dead .
ain't nobody here but two people in green .
it goes beyond that .
nothing goes beyond that .
this girl , they told the king that she was dead ... ... and everybody grieved .
but she was alive .
then you better go get her .
we know this house .
maskala is a suburban villa in dubai .
some people operate a halfway house there ... ... for young women they have coerced or drugged ... ... into spending their short lives as whores for arabian tourists .
of late , the girls have been , in the main , from the former sov bloc .
now and again , a north american girl , if she is exceedingly lovely ... ... blond , usually blond ... ... will unfortunately find her way to dubai .
they travel drugged .
they are tidied up and sold .
for some reason , most of them are sold to yemen .
the girls are generally held in dubai till the end of the month ... ... when the merrymakers fly in to examine their purchases and take them home .
and then?
that is " and then .
this is an american girl?
and if that were so?
if that were so , why don't your people go and fetch her?
why don't they go and get her , bobby?

there are some people in this house ...
avi . ... that if you were to go while you were there ... ... if you said hello to them for me , i could cut your price .

and as we return again ... ... the administration , forced by this terrible abduction
thank god they had that ability .
that's right .
to capitalize on the drowning deaths , to capitalize on the unfortunate deaths ... ... of those two people sailing .
here is the arrival of laura 's father .
who can forget these images?
laura newton in the united states .
yes , indeed .
many believe that robert burch is due not only the thanks ... ... but the admiration of the entire american people for his role .
terror takes many forms .
i can conceive of no act of terror greater than the unforgivable ... ... the ultimate destruction , that of a human soul .
the kidnapping of laura newton has revealed to us ... ... has allowed us to confront and will allow us to eradicate ... ... the international traffic in souls .
it was brought about because of a family's love for their daughter .
a simple american act .
the love of americans for all our daughters ... ... who are the soul ....
who are the soul of this great country .
we thank god ...
time to go home . ... this one daughter has returned home .
we vow that we will not rest ...
lucky man . ... until all who have suffered her fate ... ... are once again reunited with their families .
thank you .
