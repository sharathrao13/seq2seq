neil diamond .
hot august night , 1972 .
that concert rocked and rolled .
i know because i was there .
that's me .
my water broke .
eversince then , i've had this cosmic connection with neil .
but this story isn't about neil .
it's about me and my two pals , darren and j. d.
best friends since fifth grade .
that's j. d. he's lactose intolerant .
and he's not very bright .
that's darren silverman .
he's a romantic .
but when it comes to women , he's incredibly gullible .
that's me , wayne .
i'm loyal to my friends .
i'd beat you up if you weren't a girl .
me too .
after that , i started working out .
we stayed best friends throughout high school .
i was the third string quarterback .
j. d. became the school mascot .
hey , what did you say i didn't really motherfucking hear you .
yeah , yeah you yeah you , yeah you , yeah you
and darren joined the cheerleading squad .
oh , that's sandy .
yeah , darren's always had a thing for her .

oh , that's coach norton .
he was a big influence in our lives .
he taught us many things .

i'm a mime .
i'm a mime .
hey , mimes don't talk .
they do when they're off duty .
it's not her .

i'm really afraid that there's nobody out there for me .
the only girl i ever loved ... ... walked out of my life years ago .
sandy perkus .
rememberher?
smile .
her family was with the circus .
her dad was the strong man .
hermom was the bearded lady .
herbrother was the dog faced boy .
before i mustered the courage to ask her out , she moved away .
you know , i truly believe ... ... that there is a one and only someone for everyone .
and sandy ... ... sandy perkus ... ... was my one and only .
man , that is so romantic .
oh , my god !
look at that juicy piece of ass .
what do you think of her?

i don't want you to see wayne or j. d. ever again , darren !
but they're my best friends .
you're getting new friends , and you're quitting that bullshit band .
i know you're upset .

okay , fine .
no more sex .

you're not allowed to go down on me for one month .
no , judith , please
don't make me take away your masturbation privileges .
you go , boys .
you sing this song .
you know it .
come on , boys .
sing it !
sing it !
this blows , man .
judith's out of control .
we gotta do something .
besides ruining the band , what else has she done?
ever since she moved in with him , she's controlled his life .
she didn't like his ass .
made him get butt cheek implants .
i thought his ass looked tighter .
check this out .
last night ... ... torched his neil diamond albums .
she torched neil?
you're right .
she's a monster .
two , three , four .
hey !
yes !
hey , guys , sorry i'm late .
it's all right .
i only have a minute .
i have to wax judith's legs .
we miss you .
we never see you anymore .
i know , i'm sorry ... ... but i've just been so happy spending time with judith .
plus , my relationship counseling sessions
counseling?
yeah .
i go two hours , three times a week .
oh .
who's your counselor?
judith .
we don't think she's right for you .
break up with her .
she's ruining our lives and yours .
this graph should illustrate our point .
93 .
it is now an eight .
band numbers have plunged dramatically .
girls , never very high , at nine .
but look now .
two !
this has led to increased wanking off .
i'm chafing .
shit , i gotta go home and heat the wax .
guys , listen .
thanks for your concern , really .
i miss you too .
but it was great seeing you , all right?
that guy's in serious trouble .
we need to save him .
sorry to bother you .
what are you doing here?
we want to apologize for the beer shower .
and the salsa bath .
that was bad .
get the hell out of here .
just give us a minute , okay?
my rate is $200 an hour .
do you have any money?
i got some of that .
just give me the big bills .
six .
is that all you have?
thirty . $7 . 38 .
two and a half minutes .
we don't want you seeing darren .
we don't think you're right for him .
the band needs him .
but we're prepared to buy you off .
with what?
my house .
okay?
look .
my grandma here?
she was born in this house , is buried in the back yard .
there's my mom ... ... there's my dad and there's me .
my dad was dropping me on my head .
but ... ... we're willing to sign this over to you ... ... if you just agree not to see darren .
i don't want your shitty house or your dead grandma .
i'll throw j. d. in .
he doesn't look like much ... ... but he's hung like a horse .
it's true .
look , darren's mine .
there's nothing you can do about it .
i own him .
he does whatever i say .
i'm in complete control of him .
he's my puppet and i'm his puppet master .
you're not taking darren away !
just try to stop me .
one round , winner takes darren .
you're on .
kick her ass .
go .
you've got quite a grip .
you must be a heavy masturbator .
my guess is three times a day?
i bet you're a premature ejaculator .
you start off with a big bang .
before you know it , you're limp .
i win , you lose .
now get out .
god !
hey , check it out .
hey , baby .
hello , ladies .
so how much?
fifty bucks for you , and 200 for your friend .
okay .
all right .
i want you to laugh like he just said something .
perfect !
get this one .

like this .
douche , douche .
yeah , you .

hi , judith .
how's it going?
not so good .
look at these .
oh , my god .
he's sick .
he's perverted .
he's cheating on you .
with two chicks .
i don't know .
i guess i'd dump him?
oh , totally .
right?
do you guys notice anything weird about these photos?
no , that's darren , all right .
darren doesn't have a tattoo .
nice try , idiots .
if i ever see you near darren again ... ... i'll kill you .
thanks for meeting me here .
i have something important to say .
oh , man .
you broke up?
no .
out of the blue , judith proposed to me .
we're engaged .
what?
dude , congratulations .
starting next week , i'll be mr. darren fessbeggler .
right , because you're gonna take her last name , huh?
yeah , well ... ... judith feels , and i think she's got a really good point here ... ... that it's sexist for the woman to take the man's last name .
anyway , it's too late to change it .
we've already ordered the monogrammed towels .
darren .
sandy?
sandy perkus .
oh , my god , darren .
it's been so long .
yeah , it has .
hey , it's wayne .
high school , remember?
you remember?
right !
the senior talent show .
yeah , you were booed off the stage .
that was me .
yep .
sandy , remember me?
j. d. mcnugent?
i went to the prom ... ... with a tuxedo painted on my naked body .
oh , i guess i missed it .
i spilled a drink and the paint ran and everyone could see my dong .
it doesn't ring a bell .
remember , in science , i was lighting farts with the bunsen burner ... ... and i singed my ball sac?
no .
man .
i still can't grow hair on my left nut .
sucks .
so how are you?
great .

sandy perkus has just walked back into your life .
you even said so yourself .

she used to be .
now judith is my one and only someone .
i'll talk to you guys later .
okay?

wow , that is exciting .
this is my fianc , darren .
pleased to meet you .
same .
congratulations .
thank you .
excuse me , i'll get it .
is darren here?
i think he left his vespa helmet .
what's going on?
we're having our engagement party .
oh , then i guess our invitations must've been lost in the mail .
no .
i think it's very possible she didn't even send us invitations .
thanks for stopping by .
who's darren talking to?
those are his new friends .
i'll have a merlot .
a spritzer .
we don't work here .
you fooled me .
my name's brett , this is clayton .
this is darren .
yeah , we know who he is , clayton .
darren's our friend , brett .
we knew him first .
fuck you , replacement friend !
eat this , fake wayne !
stop it !
do something !
get out of here !
hey , this isn't over yet !
we're not giving up on darren !
she thinks this game is over .
it's not over .
no !
but we are taking this into overtime !
yeah !
okay , strategy session .
okay , our enemy is wicked .
dude , she's freddy krueger .
no , damien .
dude , she's vader .
no , she is the emperor !
but with really great tits .
okay , now , sandy?
that girl , she's a nice girl .
she's a sweetheart .
dude , a saint .
a goddess .
a princess .
you know what?
she's kind of like mother teresa .
but with way better tits .
and darren loves sandy no matter what he says .
definitely .
that's why we have to intervene and fix the problem !
definitely !
all right !
we're gonna kidnap judith and set darren up with sandy .
what?
the bat is leaving the cave .
roger that .
alarm system has been deactivated .
out .
roger that .
dude , you don't have to do the
sound .
it already does that .
out .
copy that .
i'm not going to make the
sound after i say stuff from now on .
shady mcnugent ... ... over and out .
that was the last one .
i'm scared .
what if we get caught?
not gonna happen .
i'm hungry .
we'll eat later .
can we go to happy burger?
yes , after the kidnapping .
i'm gonna get a chubby checker with
with cheese .
what?
you go downstairs and i'll check upstairs .
do the navy seal signals .
i only know the air force signals .
i'll be on the lookout .
god !
i haven't located heryet .
me neither .
keep checking .
wait a second .
i think i see something in the back of the refrig
in the back of the closet .
check it out .
nope .
coast is clear .
i'll keep looking down here , buddy .
you keep an eye peeled up there .
oh , shit .
what is it?
i'm hit .
i need backup .
i'm coming .
what happ
help !
dead leg .
help me , wayne .
oh , my god .
get the door .
get the door .
door .
darren , i'm leaving you .
we're finished .
done .
don't call , write , e mail or fax .
i never want to see your face oryour fake butt again .
okay , get down there .
dude , wait .
why me?
because you're guarding judith .
i'm dealing with darren and sandy .
but when we let her go , she'll be able to identify me .
no .
she won't be able to because you'll be wearing this .
but after we let her go , the cops will look for a guy dressed as a bird .
so?
so , what am i gonna wear to work?
your work clothes .
but tomorrow's casual friday .
get downstairs !
who the hell are you?
thanks for meeting me .
i called you out of the blue
that's okay .
i love catching up with old high school friends .
are you single?
yes .
great .
look , i wanted to talk to you about darren silverman .
he's a really good guy .
you know what?
he works with the elderly .
really?
that is so sweet .
he still talks about you .
there's something
he even writes poems about you .
in fact ... ... i think he loves you .
wayne , i'm gonna become a nun .
in a week , i take my final vows .
i didn't even know that you were religious .
i wasn't in high school .
but after i graduated , i joined my parents in the circus .
and i became a trapeze artist .
i fell in love with mypartner , luigi panini .
ladies and gentlemen , the fabulous luigi !
and everything was perfect until ....
talent scouts were in the audience .
luigi wanted to impress them .
he was a great trapeze artist , but he was completely vain .
and now luigi will attempt the most dangerous stunt ... ... in the history of trapeze ... ... the quadruple bierman .
luigi !
wow .
yeah .
after luigi died , i knew i would never love again .
that's when i decided to devote my life to serving god and helping others .
so you haven't taken your final vows yet , right?
right .
so technically , you're not a nun yet .
well , no .
i mean , not yet .
so why not then just have lunch with darren?
i can't figure out why judith left .
it doesn't make any sense .
she didn't even take her clothes .
maybe she went where she didn't need clothes : a nudist colony .
i don't think so .
maybe she got kidnapped .
you think?
no .
definitely not .
that's impossible .
it's like , why would that happen in a world?
maybe she's a lesbo .
come on .
maybe she's a herm .
what?
a hermaphrodite .
little dick , little puss .
guess who i bumped into today .
who?
sandy perkus , and she wants to see you .
i'm engaged to judith , wayne .
she dumped you , dude .
just have lunch with sandy .
what's it gonna hurt?
no way .
judith's coming back .
what if she doesn't?
as long as judith's alive , i'll never give up on her .
okay?
okay?
i got it .
crowbar me .
oh , my god .
what is it?
this dead chick is really stacked .
okay , go , go .
go .
what are you doing?
jacket's caught .
take it off !
i love this jacket !
lose it !
damn !
that was my favorite jacket .
in a bizarre incident last night , judith fessbeggler ... ... was incinerated beyond recognition when her bmw ... ... careened offa cliff .
investigators have declared it an accident .
no foul play is suspected .
in unrelated news , the body of deceased local joan snerd ... ... was dug up in a grave robbing last night .
police arrested three cubans .
why are you doing this?
so you can eat and have clothes .
no , why did you kidnap me?
i'm not supposed to tell you .
oh , i get it .
the other guy's the boss .
no , i make decisions too .
i suggested that .
an outhouse .
clever .
thanks .
you must be very well educated .
i suppose .
ivy league?
more or less .
which one?
yale , harvard , princeton?
s. u.
oh , stanford university?
subway university .
i knew someone who went there .
did you know j. d. mcnugent?
no .
no .
never heard of such a person , ever .
see you later , j. d. take it easy , judith .
goddamn it !
she knows who we are? !
there was nothing i could do .
she used her super intellect on me .
she's like hannibal lecter .
great .
now we can't let her go .
so , what are we going to do?
coach .
coach !
if it ain't my favorite third string quarterback ... ... and the best damn mascot wheaton high school ever had .
lookit , he's still got it !
it's good seeing you boys .
thank you for coming to my trial .
no problem .
we were happy to act as witnesses on your behalf .
that ref blew .
he deserved what he got .
touchdown !
no touchdown .
he's out of bounds .
what? !
he's out of bounds .
you think after you get out of prison they'll let you get your old job back?
well , boys , i don't think so .
so when will they let you out?
well , i've got an appeal pending , but it doesn't look good .
the victim's whiny family's protesting .
what's their damn problem?
so , what brings you boys here?
well , coach , we need your advice .
okay , shoot .
darren fell in love with this girl , judith .
and we kidnapped her .
kill her .
wait a minute and let me finish .
so we screwed up because now she knows who we are .
so we can't let her go , or she'll turn us in .
is that everything?
kill her .
we can't kill her .
you can !
wheaton warbirds can do anything they put their minds to .
but , coach , i mean , come on , actually kill a person?
what is it that i always said?
if you can dream it , you can do it .
exactly .
you have the dream .
all you have to do is turn it into reality .
okay .
thattaboy !
now , go on home and snuff her .
come on , move .
thanks , coach .
where's your bird suit?
i don't need it , because we're
because we're gonna kill you .
right?
you aren't going to shoot me .
what makes you say that?
because you're not killers .
sure we are .
you've never killed anyone .
i killed a man once .
oh , really?

and i got one that's both .
thanks , j. d.
i really appreciate you taking care of me .
my pleasure .
hey , you strike me as a pretty responsible guy .
thanks .
that's why i'm surprised that you let wayne boss you around .
wayne's not
no one bosses me around .
wayne's not the boss of me .
yeah .
i think that you seem depressed and confused .
you think?
you have a self defeating personality disorder .
have you considered therapy?
i remember in high school , you were really into helping people .
at parties , you were always the designated driver .
right .
and i remember you were a really good dancer .
and strong too .
you used to be able to lift me up over your head .
still can .
oh , really?
ready?
and ....
oh , darren !
help me !
are you okay?
i can't  just hang on .
i can't swim .
darren !
are you okay?
thank you .
thank you for saving me .
no problem .
let it out now .
there you go .
come on .
let's go , okay?
you're a lot stronger than you were in high school .
yeah , well , the convent's got a great gym .
and ever since then , i've been afraid of toilets .
what else can i say about second grade?
j. d. , let's fast forward .
have you ever had a girlfriend?
yes .
no .
have you ever fantasized about having sex with a man?
which man?
any man .
you mean , like , a tall man?
sure , whatever .
i don't like tall people .
how about a short man?
how short?
sometimes people can be too short .
that's weird , like midgets .
have you fantasized about having sex with any man?
any man at all?
does that include celebrities?
can i ask you something?
sure .
i mean , not that it matters now ... ... but if i had asked you out back in high school , would you have gone?
definitely .
not that it matters now , you know .
right .
perfect .
thanks .
could you , you know , turn around?
right .
yeah , certainly .
i have these .
sorry , sorry , those are ....
thanks .
can you zip me up?
yeah .
i had a really good time .
me too .
do you want to have dinner tonight?
i can't .
tomorrow i have a test in my catechism class ... ... and i have to score at least an 85 so i can take my vows on sunday .
what about tomorrow?
i'm scheduled to take care of an elderly nun on her death bed .
i understand .
but i'd really like to see you again .
i'll get out of it .
i always knew i was different , and now i know why .
i always knew i was different , and now i know why .
i'm gay .
you're the only person who's ever truly understood me .
it's okay .
just let it out .
everything will be all right .
it's all gonna be okay .
it's gonna be just
judith escaped .

you might as well turn around and head back to the house .
oh , thank god .

i just bagged me one of them killer goats ... ... that escaped from the zoo .
good job .
yeah .
okay , then , i'll see you later .
there .
that should hold you for tonight .

what the hell happened?
judith was giving me some therapy ... ... and helped me realize i was gay and
wait .
what?
i see what happened .
she messed with your head .
wayne , i'm gay .
no , you're not .
you're just unsuccessful with women .
no , i'm gay .
judith got me in touch with the inner j. d.
how'd she do that?
she listened .
unlike people who knew me for years and ignored all the telltale signs .
like what?
like my obsession with bette midler .
my preference for track lighting .
and the fact that i like sucking dick .
what? !
you've done that? !
not with another guy , but remember when i bought that book on yoga?
i don't want to hear anymore .
look , you want to be gay?
fine !
no problem !
but from now on , i'll take care of judith myself .
okay !
you want to be gay with me?
no !
come on , go , come on .
all you , all you !
eleven .
okay .
one more .
one more .
come on .
one more .
feel the burn .
come on , now .
eleven .
what's the matter , dear?
you never used to be so winded after only five sets .
well , mother superior ... ... i'm having some second thoughts about becoming a nun .
oh , don't get me wrong .
this is a terrific convent .
but i
but ....
well ... ... i'm having these feelings .
what kind of feelings?
you mean sexual feelings .
yeah , but it's so much more than that .
yes , well ... ... my dear ... ... you're the only one who can decide if this is the life you want to live .
but once you take your final vows ... ... there is no going back .
now , let's go bust out some power squats .
there .
that should keep you from escaping again .
and this ....
this ....
this should keep you from biting .
how am i gonna eat?
i thought of that .
what is that?
it's breakfast .
it's pancakes , sausage , hash brown , pop tart , pured .
i won't eat it .
i want a big montana .
a big montana from arby's with curly fries .
i won't get you one .
if you won't eat what i made for you , you can starve !
why are you doing this? !
to save our friendship .
friendship?
it seems like you're in love with darren .
bullshit !
just get over it .
your buddy smokes pole and so do you .
i am so un gay !
let's pretend you're straight .
when's the last time you got any?
none of your business .
so it's been years?
i'm waiting for the right woman .
there is no right woman .
if there was , you've already met and she's killed herself or become gay .
bite me !
blow me !
skank !
eunuch !
stealer of my friend !
what happened to your head?
i saw judith .
judith's dead .
yeah , but ... ... i could've sworn it was her .
i was on  you poor thing .
you're still not over her death .
maybe we shouldn't be seeing each other .
no .
no .
god , i'm fine .
and , look , i can deal with this .
okay?
so , what are you having?
let's see .
there's the duck .
that was always judith's favorite .
i'm sorry .
i should leave .
no , you shouldn't .
i'm so sorry .
i will never mention judith's name again , really .
i swear .
i swear .
would you excuse me for a moment?
please .
i'll be right back .
okay?
in a in a moment .
damn it !
what do you want? !
wayne , it's me , darren .
i have a problem .
i'm with sandy , but i can't stop talking about judith .
okay .
i'll be right there .
okay , open up your shirt .
why?
just do it .
what is this?
now ... ... here's what's gonna happen .
i'm going to listen to your conversation .
now ... ... if you say anything about judith ... ... or so much as mention her name ... ... then i'll give you a little shock .
perfect .
i don't think i'm comfortable having these things on my nipples .
i could put them on your balls .
the nipples are fine .
nipples work .
hi .
sorry , sorry , sorry .
i'm back .
i am back .
there was a talkative men's room attendant .
that's okay .
excuse me .
hey .
this table's reserved .
you know what?
i come here all the time , and spend a lot of money ... ... so why not leave me the hell alone?
i don't mean to be pushy ... ... but if this relationship is gonna get serious ... ... i have to give up becoming a nun ... ... and i'd have to decide soon ... ... because my final vows are on sunday .
yeah , that thought had occurred to me .
and if i do that ... ... i need to know that you want marriage and a family .
absolutely .
i never thought i'd say this to anyone after luigi died , but ... ... i love you , darren .
i love you too , judith .
judith? !
i mean sandy .
i mean , let's dance .
okay?
you're out of here .
put me down !
i haven't ordered yet !
time for an attitude adjustment , mister .
hey , nice move .
damn , he's good .
darren !
oh , my god !
oh , jeez .
oh , my god !
are you okay?
it was a little weird .
what's going on?
i can explain .
it's aversion therapy .
wayne was trying to help me get over judith ... ... so i had these things nipples
oh , my god .
it's so much worse than i thought .
no , you're obviously not ready for this relationship .
no , i am !
sandy , wait !
okay .
damn it !
wait , wait .
wait , sandy !
oh , my god !
darren .
what happened to you?
i ran here from the club .
that's 30 miles !
yeah , i know .
i wanted to say ... ... i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
can you ever forgive me?
because the whole judith thing and the nipple clamps ...
... it's crazy , and  yes !
really?
yes .
just like that?
well , i am training to become a nun , you know .
forgiveness is just sort of my thing .
i love you .
really?
i love you .
i love you .
oh , love .
love .
happy?
you didn't have to do that .
i just happened to be by arby's .
they were throwing out old food ... ... so , you know , i thought , " why not?
either way , that's nice of you .
why darren?
what do you mean?
you don't seem the type to go for a sensitive guy like darren .
you seem more the kind of woman that needs an assertive type of guy .
before i met darren , i was
i was engaged to a guy like that .
his idea of fun was to fly to thailand to fight in a kickboxing tournament .
u. s. a. !
go , josh !
after that , i decided no more tough guys .
yeah , and then you found darren .
yeah .
so do you even love him?
there's different types of love .
i knew it !
sometimes you make rational decisions .
you can't always follow your heart .
yeah , whatever .
i will admit there's something sexy about a man who takes charge .
like you kidnapping me .
that took balls .
big balls .
i gotta say it turned me on .
it did?
oh , my god .
goddamn these chains !
little key , little key .
what am i doing?
i can't let you go !
just give me one free hand .
it'll be worth it .
okay .
give me the fries .
hi .
wow .
hey .
shit .
just wait one minute , okay?
dude  dude , you got a boner?
no .
why didn't you answer the door?
i'm eating .
so?
i don't answer when i'm eating .
since when?
since always .
i never knew that .
you didn't know a lot , like i'm gay .
anything else you want to tell me?
i got three balls .
shut up !
god !
dude .
hi , coach .
what are you doing here?
retrial .
got a judge that's a sports fan .
congrats .
what will you do now?
that's why i'm here .

i knew i could count on you .
well , we gotta talk about  you stay as long as you like .

i'll find something .
play it cool .
we'll find some way to get rid of him .
we tell him we got dates .
he can't be here because we're getting laid .
no , he'll never believe that .
we'll tell him we got ghosts .
so , boys , what's for supper?
listen , coach  we have ghosts .
we were thinking that maybe you staying here's not such a great idea .
nonsense .
it'll give us a chance to get to know one another again .
so you boys take care of that bitch that was gonna marry silverman?
yeah , we snuffed that bitch just like you said .
good .
how'd you do it?
we  ate her .
you ate her?
yeah .

my hat goes off to you .
you boys are smart .
that's the perfect crime .
wonder what's on the tube .
no !
coach !
no !
what the hell we got here?
some kind of public access show?
that's the kidnap victim , ain't it?
you didn't kill her !
no .
coach , listen ....
i am really disappointed in you boys .
i want you to go out there and off that cooze .
we can't , coach .
oh , for pete's sakes !
look !
she's getting out !

of course not .
i love a good challenge .

i'm not a tramp .

i'm gone for a week , and you're screwing a nun?
no , no .
we're in love .
i thought you were dead .
oh , really?
well , i'm not dead .
i was kidnapped , okay?
it was hell !
i was beaten , tortured ... ... and treated like a frigging farm animal !
and the entire time ... ... the only thing that kept me alive was the thought ... ... that somewhere out there , my sweet darren still loved me ... ... and that one day we'd be together again .
it was so horrible .
where are we going?
i don't know .
we gotta find her .
okay , where to?
go left !
i'm going right !
they kept me in a dark closet for days .
and they fed me , like , crushed potato chips under the door .
maybe i should go .
oh , no .
please .
please , don't .
don't leave .
well , but , i mean ... ... judith's alive , and she is your fiance .
i know .
you're right .
you're right .
but ....
but you can't go because i ....
because what?
why , darren?
because i
see , you  yeah?
well , we and  yeah?
sweetheart , we pledged our love to one another .
spare her the pain of seeing us together .
you ... ... run along back to the nunnery .
she's right .
i mean ... ... i did pledge .
okay .

she's here !
hey , darren .
sandy , hi .

i deserved that .
but now let me explain

dude .
sorry .
mr. diamond , you gotta help us save our buddy .
he's marrying the wrong woman .
sandy and darren , they broke up .
love on the rocks .
ain't no big surprise .
help us get them back together .
i don't know .
turn on your heart light .
judith brainwashed him .
for years , darren loved me , but i never knew it .
hold it .
hold it !
hold on .
and did i mention i was gay?
i've spent my life writing songs about the power of love ... ... but up until right now , they've only been words .
this may be my chance to prove that those words really mean something .
you say that if darren marries ...
judith . ... judith , he'll be miserable .
right .
i believe in happy endings .
if neil diamond has anything to do with it ... ... this love story will have one .
come on !
yeah !
we got neil diamond onboard !
all right !
where we going?
the park on america avenue .
5 0 !

cops .
caprice .
five cars back .
goddamn heat .
one little prison break , and they're all over you .
whoa , coach .
no matter what happens , don't look back .
just get this sweet gal to the man who loves her .
i'd rather be cut down in a hail of gunfire than to go back to jail .
nice meeting you , mr. diamond .
coach , look out !
they're not cops !
hey , we're coming to america .
dearly beloved , we are gathered here today to join darren silverman ... ... and judith fessbeggler in holy matrimony .

you're in love with this slut?
i am not a slut .
sandy is my one and only someone .
what about me?
who's my someone?
you ruined my life !
but i saved darren's !
just because i lost darren doesn't mean i'm crazy enough ... ... to hook up with you !
why can't you just admit that when you kissed me , you liked it?
you're right .
i have a weakness for incompetent morons .
admit it !
i'm the strong willed , assertive man that you need ... ... and you're the hard core bitch that i've always dreamed of .
what about you?
when are you gonna get hitched?
actually , i'm not .
i'm gay .

i don't want you to see wayne or j. d. ever again , darren !
but they're my best friends .
you're getting new friends , and you're quitting that bullshit band .
i know you're upset .

okay , fine .
no more sex .

you're not allowed to go down on me for one month .

don't make me take away your masturbation privileges .
you go , boys .
you sing this song .
you know it .
come on , boys .
sing it !
sing it !
this blows , man .
judith's out of control .
we gotta do something .
besides ruining the band , what else has she done?
ever since she moved in with him , she's controlled his life .
she didn't like his ass .
made him get butt cheek implants .
i thought his ass looked tighter .
check this out .
last night ... ... torched his neil diamond albums .
she torched neil?
you're right .
she's a monster .
two , three , four .
hey !
yes !
hey , guys , sorry i'm late .
it's all right .
i only have a minute .
i have to wax judith's legs .
we miss you .
we never see you anymore .
i know , i'm sorry ... ... but i've just been so happy spending time with judith .
plus , my relationship counseling sessions
counseling?
yeah .
i go two hours , three times a week .
oh .
who's your counselor?
judith .
we don't think she's right for you .
break up with her .
she's ruining our lives and yours .
this graph should illustrate our point .
93 .
it is now an eight .
band numbers have plunged dramatically .
girls , never very high , at nine .
but look now .
two !
this has led to increased wanking off .
i'm chafing .
shit , i gotta go home and heat the wax .
guys , listen .
thanks for your concern , really .
i miss you too .
but it was great seeing you , all right?
that guy's in serious trouble .
we need to save him .
sorry to bother you .
what are you doing here?
we want to apologize for the beer shower .
and the salsa bath .
that was bad .
get the hell out of here .
just give us a minute , okay?
my rate is $200 an hour .
do you have any money?
i got some of that .
just give me the big bills .
six .
is that all you have?
thirty . $7 . 38 .
two and a half minutes .
we don't want you seeing darren .
we don't think you're right for him .
the band needs him .
but we're prepared to buy you off .
with what?
my house .
okay?
look .
my grandma here?
she was born in this house , is buried in the back yard .
there's my mom ... ... there's my dad and there's me .
my dad was dropping me on my head .
but ... ... we're willing to sign this over to you ... ... if you just agree not to see darren .
i don't want your shitty house or your dead grandma .
i'll throw j. d. in .
he doesn't look like much ... ... but he's hung like a horse .
it's true .
look , darren's mine .
there's nothing you can do about it .
i own him .
he does whatever i say .
i'm in complete control of him .
he's my puppet and i'm his puppet master .
you're not taking darren away !
just try to stop me .
one round , winner takes darren .
you're on .
kick her ass .
go .
you've got quite a grip .
you must be a heavy masturbator .
my guess is three times a day?
i bet you're a premature ejaculator .
you start off with a big bang .
before you know it , you're limp .
i win , you lose .
now get out .
god !
hey , check it out .
hey , baby .
hello , ladies .
so how much?
fifty bucks for you , and 200 for your friend .
okay .
all right .
i want you to laugh like he just said something .
perfect !
get this one .

like this .
douche , douche .

don't look back .
hurry up .

hi , judith .
how's it going?
not so good .
look at these .
oh , my god .
he's sick .
he's perverted .
he's cheating on you .
with two chicks .
i don't know .
i guess i'd dump him?
oh , totally .
right?
do you guys notice anything weird about these photos?
no , that's darren , all right .
darren doesn't have a tattoo .
nice try , idiots .
if i ever see you near darren again ... ... i'll kill you .
thanks for meeting me here .
i have something important to say .
oh , man .
you broke up?
no .
out of the blue , judith proposed to me .
we're engaged .
what?
dude , congratulations .
starting next week , i'll be mr. darren fessbeggler .
right , because you're gonna take her last name , huh?
yeah , well ... ... judith feels , and i think she's got a really good point here ... ... that it's sexist for the woman to take the man's last name .
anyway , it's too late to change it .
we've already ordered the monogrammed towels .
darren .
sandy?
sandy perkus .
oh , my god , darren .
it's been so long .
yeah , it has .
hey , it's wayne .
high school , remember?
you remember?
right !
the senior talent show .
yeah , you were booed off the stage .
that was me .
yep .
sandy , remember me?
j. d. mcnugent?
i went to the prom ... ... with a tuxedo painted on my naked body .
oh , i guess i missed it .
i spilled a drink and the paint ran and everyone could see my dong .
it doesn't ring a bell .
remember , in science , i was lighting farts with the bunsen burner ... ... and i singed my ball sac?
no .
man .
i still can't grow hair on my left nut .
sucks .
so how are you?
great .

wow , that is exciting .
this is my fianc , darren .
pleased to meet you .
same .
congratulations .
thank you .
excuse me , i'll get it .
is darren here?
i think he left his vespa helmet .
what's going on?
we're having our engagement party .
oh , then i guess our invitations must've been lost in the mail .
no .
i think it's very possible she didn't even send us invitations .
thanks for stopping by .
who's darren talking to?
those are his new friends .
i'll have a merlot .
a spritzer .
we don't work here .
you fooled me .
my name's brett , this is clayton .
this is darren .
yeah , we know who he is , clayton .
darren's our friend , brett .
we knew him first .
fuck you , replacement friend !
eat this , fake wayne !
stop it !
do something !
get out of here !
hey , this isn't over yet !
we're not giving up on darren !
she thinks this gig is over .
it's not over .
no !
but we are taking this into overtime !
yeah !
okay , strategy session .
okay , our enemy is wicked .
dude , she's freddy krueger .
no , damien .
dude , she's vader .
no , she is the emperor !
but with really great tits .
okay , now , sandy?
that girl , she's a nice girl .
she's a sweetheart .
dude , a saint .
a goddess .
a princess .
you know what?
she's kind of like mother teresa .
but with way better tits .
and darren loves sandy no matter what he says .
definitely .
that's why we have to intervene and fix the problem !
definitely !
all right !
we're gonna kidnap judith and set darren up with sandy .
what?
the bat is leaving the cave .
roger that .
alarm system has been deactivated .
out .
roger that .
dude , you don't have to do the
sound .
it already does that .
out .
copy that .
i'm not going to make the
sound after i say stuff from now on .
shady mcnugent ... ... over and out .
that was the last one .
i'm scared .
what if we get caught?
not gonna happen .
i'm hungry .
we'll eat later .
can we go to happy burger?
yes , after the kidnapping .
i'm gonna get a chubby checker with
with cheese .
what?
you go downstairs and i'll check upstairs .
do the navy seal signals .
i only know the air force signals .
i'll be on the lookout .
god !
i haven't located heryet .
me neither .
keep checking .
wait a second .
i think i see something in the back of the refrig
in the back of the closet .
check it out .
nope .
coast is clear .
i'll keep looking down here , buddy .
you keep an eye peeled up there .
oh , shit .
what is it?
i'm hit .
i need backup .
i'm coming .
what happ
help !
dead leg .
help me , wayne .
oh , my god .
get the door .
get the door .
door .
darren , i'm leaving you .
we're finished .
done .
don't call , write , e mail or fax .
i never want to see your face oryour fake butt again .
okay , get down there .
dude , wait .
why me?
because you're guarding judith .
i'm dealing with darren and sandy .
but when we let her go , she'll be able to identify me .
no .
she won't be able to because you'll be wearing this .
but after we let her go , the cops will look for a guy dressed as a bird .
so?
so , what am i gonna wear to work?
your work clothes .
but tomorrow's casual friday .
get downstairs !
who the hell are you?
thanks for meeting me .
i called you out of the blue
that's okay .
i love catching up with old high school friends .
are you single?
yes .
great .
look , i wanted to talk to you about darren silverman .
he's a really good guy .
you know what?
he works with the elderly .
really?
that is so sweet .
he still talks about you .
there's something
he even writes poems about you .
in fact ... ... i think he loves you .
wayne , i'm gonna become a nun .
in a week , i take my final vows .
i didn't even know that you were religious .
i wasn't in high school .
but after i graduated , i joined my parents in the circus .
and i became a trapeze artist .
i fell in love with mypartner , luigi panini .
ladies and gentlemen , the fabulous luigi !
and everything was perfect until ....
talent scouts were in the audience .
luigi wanted to impress them .
he was a great trapeze artist , but he was completely vain .
and now luigi will attempt the most dangerous stunt ... ... in the history of trapeze ... ... the quadruple bierman .
luigi !
wow .
yeah .
after luigi died , i knew i would never love again .
that's when i decided to devote my life to serving god and helping others .
so you haven't taken your final vows yet , right?
right .
so technically , you're not a nun yet .
well , no .
i mean , not yet .
so why not then just have lunch with darren?
i can't figure out why judith left .
it doesn't make any sense .
she didn't even take her clothes .
maybe she went where she didn't need clothes : a nudist colony .
i don't think so .
maybe she got kidnapped .
you think?
no .
definitely not .
that's impossible .
it's like , why would that happen in a world?
maybe she's a lesbo .
come on .
maybe she's a herm .
what?
a hermaphrodite .
little dick , little puss .
guess who i bumped into today .
who?
sandy perkus , and she wants to see you .
i'm engaged to judith , wayne .
she dumped you , dude .
just have lunch with sandy .
what's it gonna hurt?
no way .
judith's coming back .
what if she doesn't?
as long as judith's alive , i'll never give up on her .
okay?
okay?
i got it .
crowbar me .
oh , my god .
what is it?
this dead chick is really stacked .
okay , go , go .
go .
what are you doing?
jacket's caught .
take it off !
i love this jacket !
lose it !
damn !
that was my favorite jacket .
in a bizarre incident last night , judith fessbeggler ... ... was incinerated beyond recognition when herbmw ... ... careened offa cliff .
investigators have declared it an accident .
no foul play is suspected .
in unrelated news , the body of deceased local joan snerd ... ... was dug up in a grave robbing last night .
police arrested three cubans .
why are you doing this?
so you can eat and have clothes .
no , why did you kidnap me?
i'm not supposed to tell you .
oh , i get it .
the other guy's the boss .
no , i make decisions too .
i suggested that .
an outhouse .
clever .
thanks .
you must be very well educated .
i suppose .
ivy league?
more or less .
which one?
yale , harvard , princeton?
s. u.
oh , stanford university?
subway university .
i knew someone who went there .
did you know j. d. mcnugent?
no .
no .
never heard of such a person , ever .
see you later , j. d. take it easy , judith .
goddamn it !
she knows who we are? !
there was nothing i could do .
she used her super intellect on me .
she's like hannibal lecter .
great .
now we can't let her go .
so , what are we going to do?
coach .
coach !
if it ain't my favorite third string quarterback ... ... and the best damn mascot wheaton high school ever had .
lookit , he's still got it !
it's good seeing you boys .
thank you for coming to my trial .
no problem .
we were happy to act as witnesses on your behalf .
that ref blew .
he deserved what he got .
touchdown !
no touchdown .
he's out of bounds .
what? !
he's out of bounds .
you think after you get out of prison they'll let you get your old job back?
well , boys , i don't think so .
so when will they let you out?
well , i've got an appeal pending , but it doesn't look good .
the victim's whiny family's protesting .
what's their damn problem?
so , what brings you boys here?
well , coach , we need your advice .
okay , shoot .
darren fell in love with this girl , judith .
and we kidnapped her .
kill her .
wait a minute and let me finish .
so we screwed up because now she knows who we are .
so we can't let her go , or she'll turn us in .
is that everything?
kill her .
we can't kill her .
you can !
wheaton warbirds can do anything they put their minds to .
but , coach , i mean , come on , actually kill a person?
what is it that i always said?
if you can dream it , you can do it .
exactly .
you have the dream .
all you have to do is turn it into reality .
okay .
thattaboy !
now , go on home and snuff her .
come on , move .
thanks , coach .
where's your bird suit?
i don't need it , because we're
because we're gonna kill you .
right?
you aren't going to shoot me .
what makes you say that?
because you're not killers .
sure we are .
you've never killed anyone .
i killed a man once .
oh , really?
yeah .
who?
kevin beckley .
you didn't kill kevin beckley .
he died in a car wreck .
she doesn't know that .
goddamn it .
you see?
you guys have never killed anything in your entire lives .
one time , this squirrel ran out into the street and i ran over him ... ... and he didn't die right then , but i'm pretty sure he died right after .
it doesn't matter if we've killed or not !
we're gonna do it right now !
ready? !
ready .
do it .
i can't !
goddamn it !
okay , it's tuesday .
so?
so you're meeting sandy for lunch .
can't you see i'm in mourning?
but you promised you'd be there .
you gave her your word .
i didn't even talk to her .
okay , i gave her your word .
for god's sakes , when will you give up this idea that i'll go out with sandy?
when you go out with sandy .
now , come on .
come on .
come on .
come on , come on .
come on !
all right !
come on !
hey !
wow , you're wearing the
i'm training to become a nun .
a nun .
well , that explains it .
i hope it doesn't freak you out .
no , it doesn't .
actually , i'm relieved .
i think wayne was trying to set us up on a date .
oh , yeah .
he's got some crazy ideas .
yeah .
well , now that i know that you're unavailable ... ... it makes this easier .
we can just be friends .
exactly .
friends .
please .
thank you .
sure .
so how are your parents?
oh , great .
they're making a fortune on the lnternet .
they started their own web site , circusfreak . com .
wow , good for them .
and how's your brother , dog face boy?
he got rabies .
god , that's too bad .
yeah .
we thought we were gonna have to put him down ... ... but he recovered .
oh , good .
good .
so how are you?
oh , me?
i'm great .
yeah , everything's been really good , you know?
yeah .
well , my fiance died .
she died?
yeah , she's dead .
i am so sorry .
oh , don't be .
please don't be sorry .
it's nothing .
so how do you feel about ....
oh , no .
oh , gosh .
just cry .
let it out .
i'm here for you , okay?
i'm here for you .
thank you .
wait a minute .
wait .
you're a neil diamond fan too?
oh !
the man's a genius .
yeah !
he's the greatest songwriter performer of this or any generation .
i know .
oh , god .
i brought you some more videos .
porno or monster trucks .
and i got one that's both .
thanks , j. d.
i really appreciate you taking care of me .
my pleasure .
hey , you strike me as a pretty responsible guy .
thanks .
that's why i'm surprised that you let wayne boss you around .
wayne's not
no one bosses me around .
wayne's not the boss of me .
yeah .
i think that you seem depressed and confused .
you think?
you have a self defeating personality disorder .
have you considered therapy?
i remember in high school , you were really into helping people .
at parties , you were always the designated driver .
right .
and i remember you were a really good dancer .
and strong too .
you used to be able to lift me up over your head .
still can .
oh , really?
ready?
and ....
oh , darren !
help me !
are you okay?
i can't  just hang on .
i can't swim .
darren !
are you okay?
thank you .
thank you for saving me .
no problem .
let it out now .
there you go .
come on .
let's go , okay?
you're a lot stronger than you were in high school .
yeah , well , the convent's got a great gym .
and ever since then , i've been afraid of toilets .
what else can i say about second grade?
j. d. , let's fast forward .
have you ever had a girlfriend?
yes .
no .
have you ever fantasized about having sex with a man?
which man?
any man .
you mean , like , a tall man?
sure , whatever .
i don't like tall people .
how about a short man?
how short?
sometimes people can be too short .
that's weird , like midgets .
have you fantasized about having sex with any man?
any man at all?
does that include celebrities?
can i ask you something?
sure .
i mean , not that it matters now ... ... but if i had asked you out back in high school , would you have gone?
definitely .
not that it matters now , you know .
right .
perfect .
thanks .
could you , you know , turn around?
right .
yeah , certainly .
i have these .
sorry , sorry , those are ....
thanks .
can you zip me up?
yeah .
i had a really good time .
me too .
do you want to have dinner tonight?
i can't .
tomorrow i have a test in my catechism class ... ... and i have to score at least an 85 so i can take my vows on sunday .
what about tomorrow?
i'm scheduled to take care of an elderly nun on her death bed .
i understand .
but i'd really like to see you again .
i'll get out of it .
i always knew i was different , and now i know why .
i always knew i was different , and now i know why .
i'm gay .
you're the only person who's ever truly understood me .
it's okay .
just let it out .
everything will be all right .
it's all gonna be okay .
it's gonna be just
judith escaped .

go .
go .
go .
go .
okay , she can't be far .
i see her !
where?
okay , steady , steady !
i missed her .

i've been kidnapped !

young lady , so horny , so impatient .
oh , scrotum !
dude , she's stealing the truck !
come on !
now !
i got her .

come on !
i got her .
okay , judith , it's over .
you might as well turn around and head back to the house .
oh , thank god .
hi , officers .
you're safe .
i'm cowboy wayne .
i just bagged me one of them killer goats ... ... that escaped from the zoo .
good job .
yeah .
okay , then , i'll see you later .
there .
that should hold you for tonight .
don't !
what the hell happened?
judith was giving me some therapy ... ... and helped me realize i was gay and
wait .
what?
i see what happened .
she messed with your head .
wayne , i'm gay .
no , you're not .
you're just unsuccessful with women .
no , i'm gay .
judith got me in touch with the inner j. d.
how'd she do that?
she listened .
unlike people who knew me for years and ignored all the telltale signs .
like what?
like my obsession with bette midler .
my preference for track lighting .
and the fact that i like sucking dick .
what? !
you've done that? !
not with another guy , but remember when i bought that book on yoga?
i don't want to hear anymore .
look , you want to be gay?
fine !
no problem !
but from now on , i'll take care of judith myself .
okay !
you want to be gay with me?
no !
come on , go , come on .
all you , all you !
eleven .
okay .
one more .
one more .
come on .
one more .
feel the burn .
come on , now .
eleven .
what's the matter , dear?
you never used to be so winded after only five sets .
well , mother superior ... ... i'm having some second thoughts about becoming a nun .
oh , don't get me wrong .
this is a terrific convent .
but i
but ....
well ... ... i'm having these feelings .
what kind of feelings?
you mean sexual feelings .
yeah , but it's so much more than that .
yes , well ... ... my dear ... ... you're the only one who can decide if this is the life you want to live .
but once you take your final vows ... ... there is no going back .
now , let's go bust out some power squats .
there .
that should keep you from escaping again .
and this ....
this ....
this should keep you from biting .
how am i gonna eat?
i thought of that .
what is that?
it's breakfast .
it's pancakes , sausage , hash brown , pop tart , pured .
i won't eat it .
i want a big montana .
a big montana from arby's with curly fries .
i won't get you one .
if you won't eat what i made for you , you can starve !
why are you doing this? !
to save our friendship .
friendship?
it seems like you're in love with darren .
bullshit !
just get over it .
your buddy smokes pole and so do you .
i am so un gay !
let's pretend you're straight .
when's the last time you got any?
none of your business .
so it's been years?
i'm waiting for the right woman .
there is no right woman .
if there was , you've already met and she's killed herself or become gay .
bite me !
blow me !
skank !
eunuch !
stealer of my friend !
what happened to your head?
i saw judith .
judith's dead .
yeah , but ... ... i could've sworn it was her .
i was on  you poor thing .
you're still not over her death .
maybe we shouldn't be seeing each other .
no .
no .
god , i'm fine .
and , look , i can deal with this .
okay?
so , what are you having?
let's see .
there's the duck .
that was always judith's favorite .
i'm sorry .
i should leave .
no , you shouldn't .
i'm so sorry .
i will never mention judith's name again , really .
i swear .
i swear .
would you excuse me for a moment?
please .
i'll be right back .
okay?
in a in a moment .
damn it !
what do you want? !
wayne , it's me , darren .
i have a problem .
i'm with sandy , but i can't stop talking about judith .
okay .
i'll be right there .
okay , open up your shirt .
why?
just do it .
what is this?
now ... ... here's what's gonna happen .
i'm going to listen to your conversation .
now ... ... if you say anything about judith ... ... or so much as mention her name ... ... then i'll give you a little shock .
perfect .
i don't think i'm comfortable having these things on my nipples .
i could put them on your balls .
the nipples are fine .
nipples work .
hi .
sorry , sorry , sorry .
i'm back .
i am back .
there was a talkative men's room attendant .
that's okay .
excuse me .
hey .
this table's reserved .
you know what?
i come here all the time , and spend a lot of money ... ... so why not leave me the hell alone?
i don't mean to be pushy ... ... but if this relationship is gonna get serious ... ... i have to give up becoming a nun ... ... and i'd have to decide soon ... ... because my final vows are on sunday .
yeah , that thought had occurred to me .
and if i do that ... ... i need to know that you want marriage and a family .
absolutely .
i never thought i'd say this to anyone after luigi died , but ... ... i love you , darren .
i love you too , judith .
judith? !
i mean sandy .
i mean , let's dance .
okay?
you're out of here .
put me down !
i haven't ordered yet !
time for an attitude adjustment , mister .
hey , nice move .
damn , he's good .
darren !
oh , my god !
oh , jeez .
oh , my god !
are you okay?
it was a little weird .
what's going on?
i can explain .
it's aversion therapy .
wayne was trying to help me get over judith ... ... so i had these things nipples
oh , my god .
it's so much worse than i thought .
no , you're obviously not ready for this relationship .
no , i am !
sandy , wait !
okay .
damn it !
wait , wait .
wait , sandy !
oh , my god !
darren .
what happened to you?
i ran here from the club .
that's 30 miles !
yeah , i know .
i wanted to say ... ... i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
can you ever forgive me?
because the whole judith thing and the nipple clamps ...
... it's crazy , and  yes !
really?
yes .
just like that?
well , i am training to become a nun , you know .
forgiveness is just sort of my thing .
i love you .
really?
i love you .
i love you .
oh , love .
love .
happy?
you didn't have to do that .
i just happened to be by arby's .
they were throwing out old food ... ... so , you know , i thought , " why not?
either way , that's nice of you .
why darren?
what do you mean?
you don't seem the type to go for a sensitive guy like darren .
you seem more the kind of woman that needs an assertive type of guy .
before i met darren , i was
i was engaged to a guy like that .
his idea of fun was to fly to thailand to fight in a kickboxing tournament .
u. s. a. !
go , josh !
after that , i decided no more tough guys .
yeah , and then you found darren .
yeah .
so do you even love him?
there's different types of love .
i knew it !
sometimes you make rational decisions .
you can't always follow your heart .
yeah , whatever .
i will admit there's something sexy about a man who takes charge .
like you kidnapping me .
that took balls .
big balls .
i gotta say it turned me on .
it did?
oh , my god .
goddamn these chains !
little key , little key .
what am i doing?
i can't let you go !
just give me one free hand .
it'll be worth it .
okay .
give me the fries .
hi .
wow .
hey .
shit .
just wait one minute , okay?
dude  dude , you got a boner?
no .
why didn't you answer the door?
i'm eating .
so?
i don't answer when i'm eating .
since when?
since always .
i never knew that .
you didn't know a lot , like i'm gay .
anything else you want to tell me?
i got three balls .
shut up !
god !
dude .
hi , coach .
what are you doing here?
retrial .
got a judge that's a sports fan .
congrats .
what will you do now?
that's why i'm here .

i knew i could count on you .
well , we gotta talk about  you stay as long as you like .
great !
where's the bathroom?
i gotta take a dump .
we don't use the toilet anymore since we're cutting down on the water bill .
what do you do?
well , we just use the lawn now .
smart thinking .

that's all right .
i'll find something .
play it cool .
we'll find some way to get rid of him .
we tell him we got dates .
he can't be here because we're getting laid .
no , he'll never believe that .
we'll tell him we got ghosts .
so , boys , what's for supper?
listen , coach  we have ghosts .
we were thinking that maybe you staying here's not such a great idea .
nonsense .
it'll give us a chance to get to know one another again .
so you boys take care of that bitch that was gonna marry silverman?
yeah , we snuffed that bitch just like you said .
good .
how'd you do it?
we  ate her .
you ate her?
yeah .

my hat goes off to you .
you boys are smart .
that's the perfect crime .
wonder what's on the tube .
no !
coach !
no !
what the hell we got here?
some kind of public access show?
that's the kidnap victim , ain't it?
you didn't kill her !
no .
coach , listen ....
i am really disappointed in you boys .
i want you to go out there and off that cooze .
we can't , coach .
oh , for pete's sakes !
look !
she's getting out !
go chop her head off or something .
there's no fight left in you boys .
you're nutless .

don't worry about a thing , boys .
i'll take care of that broad .
don't worry !

let's say i'm a friend of the boys , and i'm here to kill you .
you don't mind if i try to defend myself , do you?
of course not .
i love a good challenge .

i'm not a tramp .

i'm gone for a week , and you're screwing a nun?
no , no .
we're in love .
i thought you were dead .
oh , really?
well , i'm not dead .
i was kidnapped , okay?
it was hell !
i was beaten , tortured ... ... and treated like a frigging farm animal !
and the entire time ... ... the only thing that kept me alive was the thought ... ... that somewhere out there , my sweet darren still loved me ... ... and that one day we'd be together again .
it was so horrible .
where are we going?
i don't know .
we gotta find her .
okay , where to?
go left !
i'm going right !
they kept me in a dark closet for days .
and they fed me , like , crushed potato chips under the door .
maybe i should go .
oh , no .
please .
please , don't .
don't leave .
well , but , i mean ... ... judith's alive , and she is your fiance .
i know .
you're right .
you're right .
but ....
but you can't go because i ....
because what?
why , darren?
because i
see , you  yeah?
well , we and  yeah?
sweetheart , we pledged our love to one another .
spare her the pain of seeing us together .
you ... ... run along back to the nunnery .
she's right .
i mean ... ... i did pledge .

she's here !
hey , darren .
sandy , hi .

i deserved that .
but now let me explain

and a hooker .

oh , my gosh !
neil diamond !
what the hell is going on?
neil , let me explain .
you're the guys who send me all those letters and tapes .
naked pictures .
what?
we never sent you any naked pictures .
dude .
sorry .
mr. diamond , you gotta help us save our buddy .
he's marrying the wrong woman .
sandy and darren , they broke up .
love on the rocks .
ain't no big surprise .
help us get them back together .
i don't know .
turn on your heart light .
judith brainwashed him .
for years , darren loved me , but i never knew it .
hold it .
hold it !
hold on .
and did i mention i was gay?
i've spent my life writing songs about the power of love ... ... but up until right now , they've only been words .
this may be my chance to prove that those words really mean something .
you say that if darren marries ...
judith . ... judith , he'll be miserable .
right .
i believe in happy endings .
if neil diamond has anything to do with it ... ... this love story will have one .
come on !
yeah !
we got neil diamond onboard !
all right !
where we going?
the park on america avenue .
5 0 !
what?
cops .
caprice .
five cars back .
goddamn heat .
one little prison break , and they're all over you .
whoa , coach .
no matter what happens , don't look back .
just get this sweet gal to the man who loves her .
i'd rather be cut down in a hail of gunfire than to go back to jail .
nice meeting you , mr. diamond .
coach , look out !
they're not cops !
hey , we're coming to america .
dearly beloved , we are gathered here today to join darren silverman ... ... and judith fessbeggler in holy matrimony .
if anyone has any objections , speak now .
i do .
what?
neil?
neil !
neil .
get to the part where we say , " i do .
oh , my !
say , " i do .
no .
say , " i do .
i can't .
because i ...
... i love neil ... ... and i love sandy .
you're in love with this slut?
i am not a slut .
sandy is my one and only someone .
what about me?
who's my someone?
you ruined my life !
but i saved darren's !
just because i lost darren doesn't mean i'm crazy enough ... ... to hook up with you !
why can't you just admit that when you kissed me , you liked it?
you're right .
i have a weakness for incompetent morons .
admit it !
i'm the strong willed , assertive man that you need ... ... and you're the hard core bitch that i've always dreamed of .
what about you?
when are you gonna get hitched?
actually , i'm not .
i'm gay .
me too .
really?
by the power vested in me by the state of washington ... ... i now pronounce you man and wife .
you may kiss the bride .
i now pronounce you man and wife .
you may kiss the bride .
i now pronounce you man and man .
you may kiss the man .
come on , we need you for this one .
