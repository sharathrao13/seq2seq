i wish we could set a wedding date without our parents actually having to meet .
honey , this weekend is gonna be fine .
and your parents are great .
oh , they're great in small doses .
well , 48 hours in coconut grove is a small dose .
besides , you've already won over my dad , and that is the hard part .
mmm .

# we're gonna get married #
# wait and see ##
the house of byrnes .
lot of good memories here .
mom?
dad?
i am watching you .
well , almost , but you have to do it with two fingers .
i am watching you .
we'll get back to that later .
guess who's here?
it's prof. einstein .
hi , little jack .
you're a genius .
i see a nobel prize in your future .
yes , i do .
study break , boys .
company's here .
pamcake !
flapjack !
shortstack , shortstack coming up !
put some syrup in the cup .
pa , pa , pa , pa , pa , pa , pa .
that's how it goes , right?
that's okay , greg .
nice to see you .
yes .
nice to see you , grandpa .
my god .
how did my nephew get so big?
look at you .
you look just like your mommy .
he does , doesn't he?
hey .
hey .
this is greg .
remember we talked about him?
hey .
sorry , greg .
the card only comes in one gender .
oh !
yeah .
now , that's ... that's all right .
he's taking you in .
he has a very keen sense for people , greg .
mmm .
he's a chip off the old block , huh?
we might have another cla man on our hands here .
i'd be discreet about my profession , greg , if i were you .
you know what i mean?
as far as your parents are concerned , i'm still a horticulturist .
hey , why is little jack here?
are deb and bob house sitting , while we're in florida?
no , they're in ko saimii , thailand .
checking on the clinic they opened during their honeymoon .
what is all this stuff , anyway?
after denny was sent away to military school , your father turned this into a learning laboratory for you know who over there .
and do you talk yet , mr. munchkinhead?
greg , greg , greg .
don't infantilize him .
talk to him like an adult .
muskrat .
huh?
muskrat , jack .
all right .
just try to understand he's a little person .
his communication skills aren't verbal yet , but he understands .
observe .
l. j. , are you hungry?
oh , wow .
look at that .
i would like to eat more please .
i'd like a nap , and then later i'll enjoy a nice poop .
oh , yeah .
i've heard about this , this baby signing stuff .
this is like cutting edge .
like ...
yeah .
well , at this age , greg , his mind is like a sponge .
look , when he reaches your age , for example , his mind will be far less capable of absorbing useful information .
so cute .
hey , can i hold him?
oh , i ...
i don't think that's such a good idea , greg .
muskrat .
uh ...
all right , all right .
this is greg .
greg will not drop you , okay?
okay .
be careful .
hello .
oh !
hello .
hey .
i think he likes me .
no?
ow !
oh , shit !
focker .
he's absorbing you like a sponge .
i don't want the first word out of his mouth to be a profanity .
it's okay .
it's okay .
cover your nose .
you're terrifying him .
focker !
it's cool that your dad is so into being a grandparent .
yeah , i guess so .
it kinda freaks my mom out .
she says he spends every last second with that kid .
oh , my god .
daddy?
wow .
daddy , what is this thing?
it's a custom designed , climate controlled motor coach .
jack calls it the highlight of our twilight .
wow .
this is incredible .
isn't it?
yeah .
ooh !
like a tank .
well , in these uncertain times , greg ,
i opted for a kevlar reinforced hull with two inch thick plexiglas windows , just like the ones they design on the russian widowmaker submarines .
i want you to conduct a field test for us , greg .
i want you to demonstrate the impregnable outer skin of the coach .
throw it at the window .
oh .
jack , i'm not gonna ...
i'm not gonna throw a brick at your window .
it's a simple demonstration .
no , i'd ...
i'd really rather not .
throw the brick .
okay .
great .
just ...
all your might .
all right .
don't worry , your rental insurance should take care of it .
you all right?
what happened?
come on , we'll call a tow truck from the road .
road?
yeah .
we're driving this to miami .
i thought we were ...
i thought we were , we're flying tomorrow .
no , no .
airline travel being what it is these days , so unreliable ,
i'll feel much more comfortable knowing i have my own posturepedic bed , my own thermostat , my own lavatory facility .
uh huh .
so ... so we're all going to be in this together?
we hit the road in exactly seven minutes , 27 seconds .
this way we'll get in early , spend an extra half day with your parents , getting to know them .
isn't that great?
that is great .
worth it for you but i m the one that gets the fumes .
honey , i m in the mood for a chimichanga .
so make a ...
hey , guys , uh , it's me .
listen , i'm getting a little worried .
i haven't heard back from you .
hope you got the message .
there's been a little change of plans .
we're gonna be , uh , coming down in jack's rv now , so we'll be arriving tomorrow afternoon , not tomorrow night .
okay?
tomorrow afternoon .
and , also , uh , they're bringing their little grandson , so , uh , he's like a baby .
so ...
i don't know .
oh , welcome aboard , me hearties .
hey , this is incredible .
yes , it's as big as our apartment .
pretty neat , huh?
hey !
mr. jinx finally learned how to flush the toilet , huh?
yeah .
jack installed a special flusher , and he learnt how to do that in about two days .
right , jack?
hey there , jinxy .
how you doing?
ready to hit the road , co captain?
wow !
i'm the co captain?
let's set sail , sailor .
# i m going up the country babe don't you wanna go #
good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen .
this is captain jack byrnes speaking .
yeah , daddy !
a quick announcement .
as a courtesy to your fellow passengers , please remember that the onboard lavatory should be used for number one only .
should the need for number two arise , we il stop at the nearest rest stop , gas station , or heavily wooded area .
thank you .
welcome aboard .
i like that thing .
hey , do you mind if i , uh , make a little announcement?
well ...
only the captain gets to make an announcement .
you want to honk the horn?
um ...
sure .
only the captain gets to honk the horn .
# i m gonna leave this city #
# got to get away #
# al this fussing and fighting #
oh , look !
hey , jinxy , see that?
# now , baby , pack your leaving trunk #
# you know we've got to leave today #
you hungry?
do you want some milk?
# but we might even leave the usa #
hey !
jack?
oh , she wants you to honk the horn .
not interested .
rules of the road .
she honks , you honk .
come on , jack .
come on .
give her a honk .
there you go .
it's like a team or something .
honk if your are horny .
oh !
thanks for that , greg .
# 'cause you've got a home #
# as long as i ve got mine ##
... for you but i m the one that gets the fumes .
honey , i m in the mood for a chimichanga .
so make a ...
hey , there .
no hard feelings , all right?
friends?
what's that?
what're you saying?
now , wait a minute .
what does this mean?
i know what this means .
squeeze , squeeze , squeeze .
oh , poop !
you got to poop , right?
okay , good .
thank you for warning me .
everybody poops .
sometimes it hurts .
it's okay .
just let it come out .
what did you do , focker?
nothing .
he ...
i think he has to poop .
that's not the sign for poop .
that's the sign for milk .
this is the sign for poop .
oh !
what's the sign for sour milk?
'cause , uh this tastes a little funky .
that's because it's from debbie's left breast , greg .
ew .
fortunately , she pumped for a week to give us enough for the trip .
okay , snack pack for little jack .
what are you doing there?
well , during the breastfeeding stage , greg , infants can get very confused and upset when they're separated from their mothers .
so i invented something to ease lj's anxiety during chow time .
i call it the mannary gland .
i had it made from an exact cast of debbie's left bosom .
oh , yeah .
okay .
it's been so effective ,
i'm thinking of getting it patented .
would you like to touch it?
uh , i wouldn't .
oh , come on , feel how soft it is .
i can ...
i can see how soft it is from here .
no , feel it , greg .
it's very ...
it looks very ...
just feel the breast , greg .
just a ...
oh , watch the nipple .
just around here .
nipple is his .
oh , yeah .
yeah .
it's got a great , lifelike , and a ...
or what i would imagine
debbie's breast might ... might actually feel like .
not that i would know .
greg .
what?
honey , you promised you wouldn't take the boob out in front of company .
it's nothing to be ashamed of .
breast feeding is perfectly natural .
dad , that's not natural , that's just weird .
as soon as little jack's topped off , we're gonna hit the road .
oh !
oh , jack , you can't drive any more tonight .
dr. monroe said no aggravating your sciatica .
honey , we're on a very precise schedule .
we bunk here tonight , we hit horrendous traffic in the morning .
greg?
yeah .
maybe you could drive the night shift .
i could do that .
i am the co captain .
so , i think that falls under my responsibilities , right?
yeah .
keep her at 55 , stay alert .
yeah , yeah .
i've been wanting to get behind the wheel of this big boy .
you got it .
pass .
sorry , got to go 55 .
captain jack's orders .
hmm .
hey !
would you like some company , greg?
uh , yeah , sure .
if you can't sleep .
go on .
have a seat .
how about a cappuccino?
oh , you don't have to do that .
it's no problem for me .
really?
yeah?
okay .
dina !
wake up and make greg a cappuccino !
shake a leg , woman !
jesus , jack , you know , i'm not that tired .
really .
relax , greg .
this cockpit's completely soundproofed .
you should've seen the look on your face .
oh !
okay , okay .
you got me .
that was ...
that was a good one .
yes , it was .
yes .
mmm hmm .
it's funny .
but you should never talk to a woman like that , you know that , greg .
it's disrespectful .
right , of course .
yeah .
greg , a man reaches a certain age when he realizes what's truly important .
hmm mmm .
you know what that is?
love?
friendship?
enjoying the moment .
living .
just love .
his legacy .
that , too .
right .
yeah .
sure .
now , my grandson , little jack , is part of that legacy .
in six months , you and pam are gonna be married .
sometime after that , you'll want to start a family of your own .
yeah .
right .
actually , on the subject ,
i had some thoughts about the wedding date .
we'll discuss that later , after this weekend , greg .
now , let's get back on point .
let me put it very simply .
if your family circle does indeed join my family circle , they'll form a chain .
i can't have a chink in my chain .
hmm .
yeah .
okay .
i get the metaphor .
now , i've never met your parents , so i'm not going to jump to any hasty conclusions .
but , like studying a frozen caveman , if i can see where you came from ,
i'll have a much better idea of where you're going .
okay .
a are you thinking maybe my parents might be
like ... like a chink in the chain or ...
a doctor and a lawyer , what's there to worry about?
mmm hmm .
ooh , it seems very nice .
is that your father?
that is my father .
hey !
there you are .
what the heck is that contraption?
i thought you guys were flying in tonight .
i left a message yesterday we were driving ...
oh , i didn't get a message .
i left you like five messages .
will you get over here and plant one on me .
talking about messages .
i've been waiting so long to see you .
my best buddy .
good to see you .
come here .
come here .
oh , i missed you .
is this not the most handsome young man you've ever seen in your life?
i used to call him a young jewish marlon brando .
huh?
can you believe
i conceived him with one testicle?
no , really .
it's true .
i only have one because the other never dropped .
it's called an undescending testicle .
it's not uncommon , but look at him .
imagine what he would have looked like if i had two .
that's a good icebreaker .
whoa !
ho !
there's the sexiest second grade teacher
i've ever seen in my life .
that was a good one .
it gets her every time .
goose bumps .
she loves it .
i'm dina byrnes .
it's so nice to meet you .
the pleasure is all mine , mon cheri .
you got to be the flower man .
that's right .
jack byrnes , pam's father .
and i'm bernard focker , gaylord's father , and we're all grownups here and we shake hands like men .
all right .
oh , we're just playing here .
give me some love .
we're family now .
what're you so shy about?
come here .
oh , wow .
look at those pecs .
wow !
you're harder than sheetrock .
now tell me the truth .
you work out with weights , right?
well , i do various calisthenics .
some medicine ball training , i play bimonthly football .
oh , footie footie football?
i was just , uh , practicing my capoeira .
what?
oh , capoeira .
yeah .
the brazilian martial art of dance fighting .
yes .
he knows what that is .
yeah .
you know , i've been doing it for weeks .
i'm really into it .
it keeps me level .
because sometimes i get wound up so tight ,
i could just snap .
you know what i mean?
what is that?
what is that?
is there a baby on board?
that's a baby .
yes , yes .
yeah .
hmm mmm .
it was all in the message .
hey , moses , go ahead , say hello to your future in laws .
no , no , he's harmless .
and yeah , fixed .
moses .
that's all right .
just shake him off .
oh , no .
don't shake .
he likes the shaking .
moses , get off !
no , don't worry .
the pink part didn't get on you .
moses , go , get in your basket .
go !
he's all talk .
who's this little guy?
this is our grandson , little jack .
oh , little baby .
how are you , little jack?
hey , dad , don't ... don't ... don't infantilize him .
just talk to him like a person .
what are you talking about?
he's a baby .
i want to talk to him like he's a baby .
bazooka !
bazooka !
he likes me .
hey , we're freezing our tushies off here in detroit .
you know , " let's head south and get some year round fun in the sun .
this house is over a 100 years old , so ...
dad .
dad , you continue the tour .
i'm gonna tell mom we're here , okay?
oh !
the upstairs bathroom is on el fritzo .
so we're all gonna have to share this one for now .
since there's a water scarcity on the island , we kind of abide by the " if it's yellow let it mellow , if it's brown flush it down " policy .
oops .
forgot my own rule .
the rv has paid for itself already .
all right , kids .
forward and backward .
rotate those hips .
let's get your kundalini rising .
and now it's time for the ladies to get into the reverse cowgirl position .
guys , you have to lie across the liberator pad
like so .
everyone look at how ira's doing it .
bingo .
bango .
bungo .
the man is loose , he's limber and he's ready for action .
so , climb aboard , girls , and let me hear your bodies talk .
ooh !
whoa !
yes !
this position is terrific for anyone with osteoporosis , gout or goiter .
stay with me , kids .
we're almost done .
ah !
honey !
oh !
all right , guys .
we have to wrap it up .
everyone .
remember to take your liberator pads .
and don't forget to stretch before you try this at home .
we don't want anyone shattering a pelvis .
hello , my precious .
oh , i love you so much .
i haven't seen my bubeleh in months .
honey , you feel thin .
no , no .
you're not eating .
what's the matter?
no .
i'm fine .
mom , how do we explain all these people to the byrneses?
honey , they're leaving .
the byrneses won't know they were here .
okay .
we agreed to be discreet about you being a sex therapist this weekend until you got to know jack and dina better .
right?
don't worry .
i'll be discreet .
i put all my toys away .
and my office is all ready for them to sleep in .
your office?
no , no .
we're putting them upstairs .
your father thought they'd be more comfortable down here .
the upstairs plumbing ...
you don't wanna know .
talk to me about something important , honey .
how are things with you and pam?
they're great .
because , you know , after two years , you have to work to keep things going .
does she still climax regularly?
mom .
you can't talk that way this weekend , okay?
honey , i'm just saying
i didn't raise you to be a so so lover .
i know .
okay , what is he doing?
what?
don't ... don't worry about them .
mom , mom , you got to get these people out of here now .
okay .
wipe that little gloss off you .
okay .
you hunt deer , bernard?
what?
no , i hate that thing .
roz's father gave it to us .
he was into all that macho wacho crap .
oh !
so is greg .
he and i went duck hunting together .
didn't we , greg?
hmm?
duck hunting?
me and you?
duck hunting?
yeah .
mmm hmm .
what?
what?
gay , you went duck hunting with ... with jack?
um , yeah .
we went , we did .
we went on a little hunting trip .
you shot a duck?
i shot at a duck and ...
mmm hmm .
you killed an innocent creature of the sky?
i don't ...
did i ...
i did ...
i don't ...
i think i might've clipped it or ...
never really checked .
oh , lord .
and now , for the piece de resistance .
oh , my goodness .
little somethin 'i've been workin 'on .
oh , i see .
oh .
mom will be out in a sec .
what's that?
it's you .
it's the wall of gaylord .
the wall of gaylord?
isn't it nice to finally display your accomplishments , son?
honey , look at all your awards .
that's great .
he's my champion .
oh , i didn't know they made ninth place ribbons .
oh , jack , they got them all the way up to 10th place .
hey !
anybody want to get a drink by the lagoon?
this one looks impressive .
mazel tov , gaylord m. focker .
world's greatest nurse .
very nice .
we've always tried to instil a sense of self in gaylord without being too goal oriented .
it's not about winning or losing , it's about passion .
we just want him to love what he's doin '.
you know what i mean , jack?
not really , bernard .
i think a competitive drive is the essential key that makes america the only remaining superpower in the world today .
well , whatever works .
mmm hmm .
all right .
don't forget the positions .
bye , dr. roz .
you're a lifesaver .
oh , thank you , bj .
goodbye .
ira , remember , easy on the thrusting .
you're not 78 anymore .
bing , bang , bong .
what ...
what kind of work does your mother do with those patients?
those look like yoga mats .
is there yoga involved?
it's yogaesque .
it's sort of , um , a , um , a ... a ... a couples therapy .
kind of mind body ...
it's kind of her own sort of ...
rozela !
sweetheart , living room !
hello !
hello !
hello !
how are you , baby girl?
good , roz .
god !
look at you , you're glowing !
oh , thank you .
hi , i'm roz focker you must be jack , and you must be dina .

l ...
i just can't believe it's taken us this long to meet , huh .
and who's this little hairball?
they brought their grandson baby jack along .
he's so adorable .
i could eat him up .
bern , did you show them where they're sleeping?
right , right , right .
because we don't have any air conditioning ,
i made up a nice spot for you in roz's office 'cause it gets the best breeze , and it's very near the communal commode .
oh , well , you know , actually , we're gonna stay in our motor home .
in the trailer?
come on , jack .
you're family .
we sleep under the same roof .
actually , mom's office is kind of cluttered .
so , that ... that works all right .
it's just really easier with little jack .
no , no .
really .
we insist .
they wanna sleep in the trailer ,
let them sleep in the trailer .
mom , it's not actually ...
it's not a trailer .
it's kind of like ...
it's like a ... like a hotel on wheels .
this is practically a hotel .
i was gonna do the turndown service ...
i know , i know , but it's their choice .
wherever you feel most comfortable is fine .
it's not right .
bern , let it go .
let it go?
fine .
yeah , let it go .
look at you , sulking .
now , look at this .
i married a teenager .
right?
at least you have the libido of a teenager .
i gave her a little matinee today ...
oh !
don't you dare !
stop it !
how about a double feature?
come on .
come on .
lagoon?
why don't we go show them the lagoon?
the lagoon .
come see the lagoon .
the lagoon , jack .
come on .
we'll get drunk , we'll take a piss in the lagoon .
roz , why don't you take them outside?
show them around .
i'll make a drink .
oh , god .
hey , dad ...
it's going good so far , right?
dad , you gotta take down that weird shrine thing .
but i'm very proud of you , gaylord .
what's wrong with showing it?
it's ridiculous .
most people aren't proud of sixth place ribbons .
most people?
since when do you care about most people?
i don't , but jack is really into winning and competition and sports .
it's a whole other thing with him .
hey .
hey .
you're a winner up here and in here .
and that's all that matters .
okay .
thank you .
i don't know what that means , but thank you .
so , to solve that problem ,
i created a life like latex left breast molded from his mother's actual left breast , so this way lj would avoid any nipple confusion .
you're avoiding confusion by strapping a boob on a man?
well , yes , believe it or not , it is less confusing because of the texture
mom . ... of the breast itself .
uh , i guess it's very , uh , creative .
it's very creative .
a little birdie told me that one of our guests here is a tom collins man .
oh , for pity's sake .
isn't that nice , jack?
that is nice .
thank you .
all right .
wait .
don't drink .
i want to make a toast .
now , i had a vasectomy in 1974 ...
'73 , honey .
you're right .
'73 .
so , unfortunately , i never had the chance to procreate a daughter , but had i been able to ,
i really would've wanted a girl as sensitive and as intelligent and as beautiful as this young lady sitting right here before us .
thank you , bernie .
and if i might add ...
greg .
yeah .
i thought you had a sister?
nope .
no sister .
you said you had a sister .
you said you milked your sister's cat .
okay , i'm not done yet .
what i'm trying to say is , it's taken far too long to do this , you know , but we're finally all together .
that's nice , honey .
oh , thank you .
all right , that's enough .
l'chaim , everyone .
l'chaim !
l'ha ha .
like you have popcorn stuck in the throat .
it's a ...
okay .
to family .
to family .
oh !
i forgot .
i want to say one more thing about my vasectomy .
sit down .
honey , get yourself over here .
i went overboard?
a little bit .
you're so cute , they'll forgive you anything .
god !
you're so beautiful .
you are the sexiest woman alive i know .
mmm .
you're just trying to get me back into bed .
or the hammock .
this is a delicious tom collins .
what i did , i used real lemon juice .
it's from our trees here .
that's the secret .
he was squeezing all afternoon .
yeah .
and , jack ,
i managed to make some lemon juice , too .
gay , you all right?
honey , you okay?
are you sure?
well , i think that roz and bernie seem like very nice people .
oh !
very nice people .
a little off color , but very nice .
oh !
but isn't it wonderful , jack?
after all this build up , the kids are finally getting married .
i feel so happy .
wait a second .
i think he just spoke .
little jack , were you about to speak?
nope , just a little flatulence .
what were you saying , honey?
nothing , dear .
guys , where are you going?
we're checking out jack's macho wacho trailer .
yeah .
i want to see that boob .
can i talk to you for a sec?
yeah .
hey , listen , don't let moses go in there .
they have a cat .
moses is perfectly trained ...
dad , he humps everything that moves .
honey , he's like his father .
i never cheated on you .
they're not listening to me .
so , what's up?
they seem to be getting along really well , don't you think?
yeah , they do .
i know .
i kind of feel bad that i worried so much .
yeah .
that was okay .
what's going on?
i'm pregnant .
you're pregnant?
mmm hmm .
i'm two weeks late .
i'm nauseous , my boobs hurt , and i can smell everything .
you're gonna have a baby .
yeah .
a baby .
oh , we're gonna have a little baby , a baby .
i'm pregnant .
i just ...
i ...
yeah .
oh , shit !
you realize your father is going to kill me?
no , no , no , no , no .
he's not gonna find out because we're not going to tell him .
no , no , no , no , no .
come on .
he's a human lie detector .
he lives to sniff out stuff like this .
we'll get through this weekend , we'll get through tomorrow .
and ... and ... and we'll tell them on sunday before we go .
okay?
we'll tell them all .
i just hate the idea of keeping secrets from your dad .
it's just one little secret .
oh !
hi , neighbours .
hello .
the fockers , honey .
a la fancy shmancy .
welcome to the chateau .
no wonder they don't want to sleep in our shit box .
look at this place .
l ...
i don't think the dog is such a good idea .
don't worry .
moses is more of a lover than a fighter .
jesus !
moses !
he's always dreamt of me having a white wedding .
you don't know how upset he's gonna be .
no , i do know .
moses !
moses !
jinxy !
dad , i told you to keep him out of the rv .
he said he wanted to see the rv .
dad !
moses !
moses !
get that goddamn dog out of here !
mo !
oh , god !
dad !
oh !
jinx .
jinx , don't do it .
jinxy , no .
don't do it !
no !
jesus !
moses !
hold on .
moses , hold on .
i'm gonna save you !
the cat can flush?
oh , my god !
get out of the way !
hey !
what the hell are you doing?
that's my toilet !
i got to get my dog !
forget your dog .
what about my toilet?
moses !
no !
stop the baby !
stop the baby !
he's alive !
he's fine .
so much for the protection of our rolling safe house .
oh , honey , he was trying to save his pet .
i mean , what if it was jinxy who got flushed into a toilet?
mr. jinx has had extensive aquatic training .
he would have known exactly what to do in the event of a submersion .
20 minute warning for dinner , guys .
sorry about the trailer , jack .
muskrat .
it's okay , bernard .
there's no way we're not telling him this weekend .
i know .
that's what i was saying .
so , what do you wanna do?
i'm not sure .
i never thought this'd be an issue .
i thought we'd be married before we got pregnant .
hey .
what?
why don't we move the wedding up to next month?
what?
then we'll tell your dad you got pregnant on the honeymoon .
oh , my god , yeah , that could work .
yeah .
it's perfect , right?
yeah .
okay .
good .
just follow my lead .
okay .
okay .
without further ado , my famous focker fondue .
come on , dig in .
come on .
get it while it's hot .
that is so impressive , bernie .
did you do that yourself?
oh , sure .
oh !
i love to cook .
i can't even fry an egg .
true .
i burn cornflakes .
i'm amazed he finds the time to cook with such a high powered legal career .
high powered?
i wouldn't exactly call ...
uh oh !
you kicked me .
why did you kick me?
i kick ... kicked you because you're being modest and you should tell people that you are a good lawyer , which he is , a a and he has fought some really big , important legal battles .
truth is , jack , when gay was born , i stopped practicing and became a stay at home dad .
oh , believe me , he won a trial or two in his day .
oh !
extremely good trial lawyer .
a regular clarence darrow .
so roz was the primary breadwinner and you didn't have a job?
dad .
honey , come on , you could say he had the hardest job .
oh , he's ... he's just kidding .
of course , i'm ...
yes .
why don't we jump into the topic of the hour , hmm , the big focker byrnes wedding .
yes .
good .
i know we've been talking about a ... a fall wedding ...
is that isabel?
oh , yeah .
our former housekeeper , isabel .
you know , she has her own catering business now , isn't that great?
and ... and i asked her to come and help bernie in the kitchen this weekend .
you didn't tell me she was here .
gay had a monster crush on her when he was a teenager .
really?
i didn't have any monster crush .
you didn't tell me about that .
yeah .
because it's not true .
oh , not true?
then i didn't catch you doing baziga to her passport photo when you were , what , 13?
honey , stop .
i walk in the door ...
where is he?
oh , there's my baby !
hey !
good to see you .
mmm .
good to see you .
l ...
i haven't seen you in years .
i know .
mmm .
yes , you ...
wow !
yeah .
look at you .
you look ...
i know .
yeah .
you look ...
i had a boob job .
wow .
yeah .
yeah .
hey !
this is , uh , dina and jack byrnes .
mucho gusto .
hi , isabel .
mucho gusto .
and this is pam byrnes , my fiance .
encantada .
nice to meet you , too .
not yet married , and already a little one?
and he is a handsome little focker .
see?
oh , no .
he's not a focker .
yeah , no .
he's not mine .
and still you stayed to raise her child?
good for you .
no , he's pam's nephew .
he has no connection to greg whatsoever .
i love you , too .
mama !
mama !
mama !
little jack , no .
those aren't for you .
oh .
mom .
i think i'll take him inside .
good idea .
you're a very lucky woman , pam .
he's very special , this one .
i think so , too .
oh , i could tell you some stories about him .
really?
oh , she's just being silly .
nice to meet you all .
nice to meet you .
so sweet .
oh !
so sweet .
hey , do you guys want some more , uh , wine?
mas vino por la mama , si .
hey .
hey , you did good , greg .
she's very pretty , this one , huh?
yeah , she's , uh , she's really great .
really great .
can you believe it's been 15 years?
so many wonderful memories from those days .
yes .
yes , lot of wonderful , kind of private memories .
so , you never told your fiance about us , huh?
um , no , i don't think i did .
i don't , i think , i don't think it ever came up on my end .
not that i didn't want her to know .
it just , never really ...
yeah , and not that , i ...
i mean , not that it wasn't great .
it was really , you know , for me it was like ...
and you were so helpful and ... and ...
don't you worry , baby .
your secret's safe with me .
okay .
there's no secrets .
but , good , yeah , maybe if we keep it quiet this weekend and then ...
because , yeah , i don't want pam to feel uncomfortable .
and then later , when it's the proper , you know , setting , i can ...
okay , yeah , okay , good .
and , uh ...
good .
oh , and fondue , fondue is going ... is goin 'over .
gay , you're just in time to hear me tell the gang how you lost your virginity to isabel .
he was 19 .
a late bloomer .
you s slept with isabel?
we were relieved .
why ... why would you , why ... why would you bring that up?
what's the problem?
it was , what , 15 years ago .
honey , your father thought that it'd be fun to share stories about our first time .
really?
that sounds like fun .
that's ...
that's fine .
come on , tell us how you popped your cherry .
come on .
i really don't feel comfortable discussing that with you , bernard .
you know what?
i suggest that we get back to talking about the wedding .
thank you , bernie .
what?
mom , didn't you just take little jack back to the room?
i'm monitoring him from a high powered multidirectional microphone planted in his crib .
oh , baby monitors .
hidden cameras .
whatever happened to a little thing called privacy?
bernie , surveillance technology has helped protect a lot of the freedoms that we as americans take advantage of today .
he's right .
it has been good .
s son , that is bullcrap in a chef's salad .
jack , tell me one smart thing the clla has done and i'll give you the deed to her house .
the clla?
the central lack of intelligence agency .
i think that baby might need a couple of pulls on that knocker of yours , jack .
no , it's okay .
we're ferberizing him .
you're what?
the ferber method .
you let him cry it out .
this way he doesn't depend on coddling .
on the other hand , the continuum concept shows that a baby benefits more from constant physical contact .
oh .
we use the ferber method .
we used the focker method .
we hugged and kissed that little prince
like there was no tomorrow .
we fockerized him .
that's right .
greggy practically slept in our bed till he was 10 .
oh , my god !
oh , i don't think it was quite that long .
yes , it was .
no , it wasn't 10 .
nine and a half , at least .
mom , i don't think so .
i didn't sleep in their bed all that time .
bernie , get the photo album .
i'm one step ahead of you .
no , no , no , we're eating dinner , come on .
these are the curls from his first trip to the barbershop .
nobody wants to see this .
oh , and you kept all of his baby teeth .
look at his darling little teeth , isn't that sweet?
uh oh , somebody looks very grumpy there .
oh , that's gay with the mohel .
the mohel?
no .
he's the man who snips the baby's little wink dink .
see , that's greg getting circumcised , right here .
we had the ceremony at my parents 'house but there was a cold snap and ...
tell him .
the heater conked out .
mom .
no matter how hard he tried , the mohel couldn't coax
greg's tiny little turtle from its shell .
you know what?
let's not talk about the tiny turtle , okay?
let's ...
th this is dinner .
honey , half the people at this table have penises .
mom , control yourself .
roz , he's right .
you're embarrassing him .
okay , i'm sorry .
make a long story short , jack , he wound up with a semicirc .
what's a semicirc?
i can't wait to hear this .
what?
it's a cross between an ant eater and ...
a german army helmet .
but , honey ...
oh !
you wanted to talk about the wedding , right?
don't tell me you kept his umbilical cord .
of course not , that's greg's foreskin .
all right , you know what?
that's it .
that's ... that's enough humiliation .
honey , stop .
we're having fun .
no , i'm not having fun .
why deny us our memories?
because we're done !
anyone in the mood for chinese?
you told me your first time was with the danish transfer student in high school .
yeah , well , you weren't exactly forthcoming about your engagement with kevin .
yeah , well , he wasn't my babysitter .
okay , i should have told you , all right .
can we just let it go , please?
we both got enough stuff to deal with this weekend .
oh , hi , jack .
hello , greg .
funny dinner , huh?
how do you mean?
i know that you are studying my family like the frozen caveman .
so , i just , i don't want you to be worried , okay?
i mean , they're a little quirky , but they they're well intentioned and ... and i think they're just nervous and ...
greg , i am sure tomorrow will be a better day .
i'm sorry , ma'am .
i thought you ordered room service .
are you sure you don't want any whipped cream with your sundae?
bern , stop it !
who's bern?
i'm chad , the bellhop .
oh , no , come on , we did that last week .
can't you be sam the carpet cleaning man?
it's illogical .
why would a carpet cleaner have whipped cream?
well , improvise , honey .
good evening , miss .
i'm here to clean your carpet .
do you mind if i put some foam down on your rug?
i don't mind at all .
good night , greg .
okay , sleep well , jack .
how long ... how long have you worked in this hotel?
it's time to put some snow on your mountains .
come on , i'm gonna get some whipped cream on those tetons .
guys !
come back in the morning , tootsie roll .
gay , you see the cowboy hat on the door?
cowboy hat is off the door !
no cowboy hat this weekend !
i'm coming in !
just stop doing what you're doing !
oh !
come on , man , you know what that cowboy hat on the door means .
will you please help me out here?
what?
we're just being ourselves .
mom , mom , please ...
i think he's saying not to be ourselves .
yes , be yourselves but be yourself in a way that's a little less than being your full selves , okay .
i don't understand this .
i mean , why you're so afraid of this jack?
you've been kissing his ass ever since you got here .
mom , i'm not afraid of him , okay .
it's not true .
it is true .
i can't believe you went duck hunting with him .
our people don't shoot ducks .
just make jack feel a little more comfortable here , okay?
so you don't want us to be ourselves?
no , i just don't want you to break his rv , dad , and ... and ... and reveal that i had sex with isabel and play weird sex games that everybody can hear in the house .
mom ...
mom , please .
if you ask me , it wouldn't be so bad if your future in laws heard this .
do me a favor .
just don't therapize the byrneses this weekend at all , okay?
all i'm saying is , a few minutes of concentrated work with him and dina , she could get him to blow like krakatoa .
right , okay , yeah , you know what?
one day , just give me one day , okay , without any complications .
we get through it , everybody goes off , we go on with our lives .
can we do that?
all right .
you got it , dude .
thank you , okay .
hon , put the hat back on the door , okay?
no mom .
no cowboy hat this weekend .
okay , but tonight doesn't count .
all aboard .
morning , partner .
morning .
sleep okay?
i slept all right , thank you .
it's nice , all of us being here together , don't you think?
bernard , do you mind if i have some privacy?
almost done .
bernie , this fritatta is wonderful .
what's in it?
well , a lot of the taste comes from this old skillet .
i've never washed it .
hey , guys , can i have everybody's attention , please?
gay , be back in a second .
okay , dad .
all right .
uh , so ...
mom , i know we've been ... we've been talking about having the , uh , wedding in october , but pam and i have been doing a little thinkin 'and playing around with some ideas and , uh , we're thinking of moving it up to june .
nice .
this june?
yeah .
yeah .
that's ... that's in a month .
i always wanted a spring wedding , you know .
well , that's great , so we can announce it at the party tonight .
good idea .
wait , what party?
jack !
let's play football !
oh , your father and i are throwing a little engagement soiree for you two lovebirds .
look at that .
that's so sweet .
thank you , guys .
i thought we were just having a nice quiet dinner .
it was supposed to be a surprise .
the phone keeps ringing , the list keeps growing .
yeah , now , it's up to 50 fockers .
when were you going to tell us about this?
50 fockers .
what could be better?
dad , what are you doing?
we never play football .
i'm trying to cement relationships here .
jack said he was into footy ball .
let's show el stiffo how we play the game .
footy ball?
come on , come on , let's play !
i'm feeling a little tired .
i think i'll sit it out with little jack , okay?
honey , you want me to keep you company?
no , dina , come on , you and i will take on jack and roz .
come on , jack , it'll be fun , we'll swap wives .
don't worry , you'll get her back after the game .
fine , we'll play three on two .
but someone needs to be official quarterback .
gay goes both ways .
i'll bet he does .
one , two .
hut .
come on .
i'll run a down and in , draw in the defense , then you'll hit roz here in the end zone for a td .
what do you mean?
he hits me where with a what?
i'll throw you the ball , you try to catch it , okay .
you want me to catch?
yeah .
on two .
ready?
yes .
hut one , hut two , hike !
come on , this way !
that way , that way , that way .
you remember that time in the park?
you remember that time in the park?
guys , come on , come on , cut it out .
i'm so proud of you .
i caught the ball .
mom , come on .
i caught the ball !
come on , huddle up .
no , i'm bored .
here !
dina , come on , let's go .
you want a spritzer?
what?
oh , a spritzer .
that sounds yummy .
all right , come on .
dad , you got to focus , all right?
he's beating you down the field every time .
you want me to be macho wacho?
no .
what?
have i ever said the words macho wacho to you in my life?
i got it .
what?
i won't disappoint you .
okay , let's try again , i'm gonna run a stop and go .
fake the short pass , then hit me here in the end zone with a hail mary .
okay , got that .
yeah , we keep running that play .
you want to mix it up a little?
no , i don't .
i've exposed bernie's weakness and i want to take advantage of it .
exposed his weakness .
okay , okay .
on four?
four .
just you and me , jack .
mano a mano .
you think you can take me , flower man?
i'm pretty sure i can , mr. mom .
you're going down , bernsie boy .
i'm going to rearrange your bouquet .
sell the pump fake , greg ,
'cause that focker's gonna bite .
hut one , hut two , hut three , hut four .
hike !
oh , my god !
are you all right?
shit !
hey , jack , you okay?
i'm fine , greg , thank you .
i see that kind of injury all the time at the hospital .
i wish you'd let me give you a quick exam .
no , i'm , i'm fine .
i told you i'll have my doctor look at it when i get home .
okay .
you know , it's amazing how your father anticipated the pump fake like that .
it's almost like he knew it was coming .
hmm .
well , he definitely takes competition seriously .
how a man handles himself on the football field says a lot about his character .
know what i mean?
okay .
hey .
hey .
we got him , didn't we , dude , huh?
was he impressed?
no , dad , he wasn't .
that was a really hard shot .
you could've hurt him .
i just wanted it to be a fun game but you wanted to win , so , you know , you got me all steamed up .
no , i asked you to play a little defense ,
i didn't ask you to turn it into a blood sport .
i play too easy .
i play too hard .
what are you really asking me to do , gaylord?
i'm not asking anything of you , dad .
just ... just go down there and apologize to him , okay?
he thinks it was a cheap shot .
sure .
okay .
whatever you say .
okay .
i can't win with this kid .
honey ...
i can't .
it's okay .
hi , baby .
hey .
so , how far along is pam?
hmm?
what?
come on , honey , i knew it the minute i saw her .
her boobs are bigger .
she's hormonal .
no wine at dinner , no football .
she just found out yesterday .
honey .
my bubeleh's going to have a baby !
my bubeleh's going to be a father !
oh , my god .
tell me , talk to me , so this is so exciting .
no .
you didn't tell dad , did you?
no , not yet .
he's gonna plotz .
no , no , mom , you can't tell him .
why not?
because he can't keep a secret .
you know that .
you think jack knows?
are you kidding?
that guy's in such denial , he still thinks his daughter is still a virgin .
yeah , i know , he's very old fashioned .
that's why pam can't tell him till after the wedding .
that is ridiculous .
mom , it isn't , believe me .
you don't know him like i do .
fine .
my lips are sealed .
i am so excited and thrilled for you .
so happy for you two !
did you plan this?
uh , no , it just sort of happened .
how did it happen?
how?
it just happened .
you know ... you know how it happens .
i mean , i'm not going into the details .
honey , i love details .
sorry .
all right .
okay .
well , you know , honey , many unplanned pregnancies happen because the man is such a sexual dynamo and the woman craves his sperm on an unconscious but very powerful level .
hmm mmm .
mom , i am truly not comfortable having this conversation with you .
no?
no .
i've been saying it since i was 11 .
all right .
love you .
love you , too .
uh , jack !
what say you and me go into town?
i got a guy who can fix your rv .
i'm in far too much physical agony , bernie .
gee , i'm sorry , but it'll be good for you , you know , to , you know , to get out and about .
yeah .
perfect .
i can take the girls shopping in coconut grove .
little jack is on a very specific napping schedule .
i better stay here .
no , go .
greg can watch him .
yeah , sure .
he has wonderful parental instincts .
dad , greg deals with little kids in the er all the time .
it's true .
they don't call me barry poppins for nothing .
that's so cute .
why would someone call you barry poppins?
they wouldn't .
now , remember , greg , we're ferberizing him .
so unless it's an emergency , under no circumstances should you pick him up or coddle him in any way when he cries .
hmm mmm .
okay .
he's learning to self soothe , that means no television , no unapproved toys , and most of all , no monkey business of any kind .
is that clear?
mmm hmm .
no monkey business .
okay .
jack .
shall we get a move on , pal o mino?
i'm ready .
i love this , roz .
this is a great find .
oh , good , and it's loose , so you can wear it even if you gain a few pounds .
isn't that lovely?
honey , are you all right?
you look a little flushed .
oh , it's just the heat .
it takes some getting used to .
i'm fine .
i'm going to try this on .
thank you , roz .
now , madame ,
let's find something sexy for the momma to wear .
look at this little number .
whoa !
i think this will get jack's blood flowing .
jack would have a coronary .
i thought so .
oh , dina , talk to me .
what's really going on with that man?
he seems very uptight .
jack's always been a little wound up .
his job was very stressful .
being a florist is stressful?
there's more to it than people think .
mmm hmm .
if you don't mind me asking , how is your sex life?
i can't tell you that .
what's the big deal?
i'm a professional .
dina , i'm a sex therapist , specializing in senior sexuality .
i knew those weren't yoga mats .
we're not 25 any anymore .
but you're not dead , either .
lots of couples our age
lack intimacy in their marriages .
i didn't say we weren't intimate .
there are special occasions .
you know , anniversaries and ...
well , on our anniversary .
ay ya yay .
nicht gut .
i beg your pardon .
not good .
i think that i can help you and jack reconnect .
how?
well , it all starts with a little bit of , uh , how shall i say , intimate contact .
yeah .
mmm hmm .
my , that tingles .
every pleasure in the body can be stimulated through the ears .
i'd give it a shot with jack tonight .
what's goin 'on over here?
nothing , just having some girl talk .
roz .
okay .
here's the deal , lj .
i'm going to give you a few minutes of attention .
but you have to promise that you don't tell grandpa jack anything , okay?
all right .
good .
okay , i don't quite know what that means , but i'm going to trust you .
all right .
here we go .
okay .
okay .
it's okay .
a little huggie wuggie never hurt anybody .
i know we aren't supposed to watch tv but we won't tell grandpa jack , will we?
oh , look , look , it's elmo .
do you like fishes?
you don't like fishes?
no .
all right .
okay .
okay .
hey , i got an idea .
let's see what pre approved genius toys grandpa jack has in his big basket of fun .
mmm?
oh , look , look , it's a ... it's a ... an abacus .
abacuses aren't that much fun , are they?
i don't know why people think they're fun .
look at this !
look !
it's ... it's bolts on a plank .
hmm?
fun bolts .
no , not very fun .
hey .
a little birdie !
look , he sings .
# and if that mockingbird don't sing #
# then greg is going to buy you a diamond ring #
# and if that diamond ring gets sold #
# greg's gonna feel like a big asshole ##
asshole .
no , no , no , you don't want to say that word .
we don't want to say that .
that's a bad word .
asshole .
no , no , no .
i thought this was a repair shop .
oh , this is better .
that's isabel's son , jorge .
15 years old , he can fix anything .
hey , bernie .
yo !
georgie boy !
so , i think you got a tear in the bilateral valve .
15 , huh?
genius .
jorge , what did i tell you?
no more tinkering until you finish your science homework .
oh .
uh , i was going to finish it but , uh , mr. gerson is out with , uh , rickets .
he said definitely don't do it until his rickets are ... are cured .
and , you know , i ...
i ...
i really ...
who knows if he's ever telling the truth?
bernie ,
i made chimichangas .
you guys want?
have you ever known me to turn down a chimi?
jack , you in the mood , amigo?
no , thanks .
why are you looking at me funny?
l ...
i ...
i said ...
oh , no , no .
you just look like somebody i know .
no , no , no , no .
tadpole .
tadpole .
can you say tadpole?
mad bull .
asshole .
no , jack's mole .
'cause jack has a big mole on his face .
is your father the mechanic?
oh , i ...
i don't know , i never met him .
never met your dad , huh?
oh , that's unfortunate .
but very interesting .
mind if i take a picture of you?
you know , just for fun .
okay .
# mr. moose likes to say good words #
# he doesn't like you to say bad words ##
asshole .
okay .
just hang on a second there .
yeah .
hello .
hi , it's me .
how's it going with the little one?
horribly .
he's crying and screaming , and cursing .
that poor kid is desperate for human contact .
honey , you need to hold him , and kiss him , do whatever it takes .
i've been hugging him in secret , feeding him chocolates , too .
al animals have babies ...
say hello to my little friend !
you know , he's probably teething .
so put a dab of rum in his milk .
and it'll ease the pain , he'll go to sleep .
you want me to give him a drink?
i'm talking , less than a thimbleful .
you don't want jack coming home to a screaming baby .
listen to your mother .
goodbye . love you .
all right , mom .
hey , little jack , i got a surprise for you .
little jack?
mr. moose is looking for you .
oh , shit !
where the hell did he go?
lj !
little jack !
lj !
lj !
does that jorge resemble anyone you know?
no one i know .
hmm .
there's something you don't see every day .
focker !
focker !
okay .
i know this looks bad , but i can explain it .
what the hell happened?
i said no monkey business .
no .
there was no monkey business .
no monkey business?
you're wearing my breast , little jack is drinking ,
moses is sodomizing jinx , and you're telling me there's no monkey business?
what is going on here?
you all right , lj?
hello !
we're home !
hey , guys .
give me the bottle .
what's happened to little jack?
his hands are stuck to the bottle of rum .
thank you , dad .
you bet they're stuck .
greg , how did this happen?
and why are you wearing antlers?
it's very complicated .
it's just a little glue .
he's fine .
he's not fine .
if he could use his hands , he'd tell you himself .
all right .
that's all right .
come on .
little jack , honey , are you okay?
greg ...
dina .
pam .
yes , dad , uh ...
i'm coming .
little jack .
honey , i said a thimble , not a bottle .
oh , greg .
hey .
how's the little guy doing?
everything is just as good as new .
yeah .
dad , come on .
is he all right?
he's asleep .
i don't care if they did call you larry poppins .
you are completely unfit to handle a child .
it was barry poppins .
what kind of sick cocktail were you gonna make my grandson?
jack , the baby's teething .
i told greg to give him some rum to ease the pain .
it was your idea?
yes .
what is wrong with you people?
i used to rub bourbon on denny's gums .
yeah !
look what happened to him .
greg , you couldn't follow a simple set of instructions?
jack , he was screaming .
so i went in and gave him a little attention .
okay?
he's learning to self soothe .
these setbacks are disastrous for his development .
the child is adorable , but you're not raising little buddha over here .
mom .
what are you saying?
i'm saying that i've seen that kid eat at least 15 boogers since he's been here and i've got news for you , jack , prodigies don't eat their own boogers .
and i have news for you .
prodigies don't come in 10th place every time either .
okay , dad .
that's my fiance .
i'm sorry .
i've never seen people celebrate mediocrity the way you do .
because we love our son?
we hug our son?
let's get down to it .
the truth is , you're so concerned about that little jack , but i think that it's the little jack in you who's crying out for a hug .
the little jack in me?
jack , you have issues .
i'm trying to understand why you run around with a rubber boob strapped to your chest .
were you ever breastfed?
mom , stop .
key question .
my guess is no .
spare me the drugstore psychology .
everybody !
all right .
everybody just ...
everybody just stop , okay?
jack , i am not going to make any excuses .
yes ,
little jack wouldn't stop crying so i gave him some hugs and i let him watch tv .
i went to answer the phone , i was gone a second , i came back in , he let himself out of the playpen , he put on scarface , and he glued his hands to the rum bottle .
okay?
that's it .
oh .
that's it
greg just said , " that's it . " so i feel much better now .
daddy , would you mind ...
please , daddy .
he made an honest mistake .
let it go .
he's fine , greg .
he's asleep .
he spoke .
asshole .
what?
did he say what i am thinking?
i think he did .
little jack , what did you just say?
asshole .
his first word?
it just slipped out of my mouth .
l ...
he has a mind like a sponge .
that's enough .
i'm calling a family conference .
oh , it's a great idea , jack .
let's finally get your problems out on the table .
no , no , i mean with my own family .
excuse us .
i'd like to talk to pam and dina in private .
of course , of course , take your time .
come on , honey .
i'm not so sure this wedding is such a good idea .
to say the least , i don't like what i'm seeing from these fockers .
what?
has greg ever mentioned the name jorge to you?
jor ...
i don't know what you're talking about .
no , why?
because i think your fiance may have a few skeletons in his closet that he is not telling you about .
and skeletons don't like living in closets .
oh , my god , here we go again .
dad , listen , you know , greg has no skeletons .
okay?
oh , really?
he does not .
do you know that?
yes , i know that .
will you just ...
i'm not a child .
i see .
she knows that .
this wedding will happen .
and the sooner you accept that , the better it's going to be for all of us .
i can't talk to you .
no .
wait a second , sweetheart .
and i'm not so sure roz is a yoga instructor , either .
jack , you promised that you'd behave yourself .
and what you said to those people was really hurtful .
i think you should go up there and apologize .
i'm not going to apologize to them .
jack .
a little birdie told me that somebody's going to be a daddy .
mom !
sorry , honey , but look at that face .
how could i keep it a secret?
he's so excited about being a grandpa .
what should he call me?
how about poppy?
you don't have to have champagne , okay?
why?
jack's really angry .
i know he's mad , but he's also a little meshuggenah .
come on , honey .
how often do we get to be grandparents?
we're having a toast .
okay , fine , but , dad , this is a secret .
we can't tell jack till after we are married .
why?
we are honest people .
no !
i can't stand this secrecy anymore .
why?
be quiet .
why should we diminish our joy just because they live in denial?
seriously .
i promised pam , okay?
she thinks it'll break his heart if he finds out .
i'm not gonna take a drink .
your father's right .
this is the 21st century !
married or not , there's no shame in fatherhood !
this is the fruit of your loins .
that is so beautiful .
say that to him again .
this is the fruit of your loins !
this is the fruit of your loins !
okay .
let's toast and let's make a sandwich , and mom wants to be the cheese .
jack byrnes , what are you doing?
what did you do?
you okay there , jacko?
what's the matter what happened?
i was , uh , coming to apologize and my back went into spasm .
it's very tender from that horrific football accident .
yeah , i feel it .
my god , you're knotted like a pretzel .
you must be in a lot of pain , huh?
i don't mind pain .
i learn from pain .
pain shmain .
my fingers are magic .
come on , let me work out the kinks .
oh .
that's a lovely offer , jack .
uh , no , thanks .
i'll be fine .
my wife does wonderful bodywork , jack .
i don't think he needs it .
okay , handsome , shirt off .
i'd rather have it on , thank you .
oh , no dice .
no , no , no .
it has to come off .
ah , lovely .
you know , most back pain is psychological .
we carry our emotional baggage right here in our muscles .
i've been watching you , jack .
studying your body language .
and you're a very sensual man .
but i'm not sure you realize that .
what are you doing?
it's a technique i learned in hawaii .
it's a lomi lomi massage named after the gentle waves of the polynesian sea .
the waves go in , and the waves go out .
the waves go in .
whoops .
hit some driftwood .
jack byrnes , you are a caged lion .
but lions can't be captives their entire lives .
they have to be free to roam the bush , free and wild .
your wife is a hot , sexy tigress and she's waiting for you to pounce on her .
let me hear you roar , baby , roar .
your body is talking to me .
it's hungry for action .
i can feel it .
unleash the beast inside you .
mom , stop it .
you're hurting him .
i am not hurting him .
i am helping him .
just don't ... don't ...
i don't think you should move just yet .
jack , come back for an afternoon session .
it'll do you good .
what're you doing?
we were so close .
i could feel it .
i was getting through to him .
the guy doesn't like to be touched .
because he has the emotional hide of a rhinoceros .
don't break him down .
just let him be .
i was trying to do you a favor .
you were riding him like seabiscuit , mom .
dial foxtrot one .
alpha , foxtrot one .
foxtrot one .
i need a full comparative dna analysis on one gaylord m focker and one jorge villalobos .
translation , george , house of the wolves .
it might take a couple of weeks , santa .
no good , foxtrot one , i need a 12 hour turnaround .
i'll secure the physical evidence and the handoff will be at harry focker's good time supper club , 2100 hours tonight .
you got it , santa .
foxtrot one out .
yello?
bernie , this is jack byrnes .
hey , jack .
hey , where are you calling from?
i'm in my rv .
would you have greg meet me here in three minutes?
you're in your trailer?
thank you , goodbye .
but ...
hey , gaylord !
jack wants you to meet him in his trailer in precisely three minutes .
and i have to tell you ,
el stiffo was really starting to freak me out .
greg , wait , okay?
listen , no matter how hard he probes you , you have to promise me that you will not break because i'm not ready to tell him i'm pregnant .
hey , honey .
honey .
what?
what?
let him probe ,
'cause he's probing a brick wall .
now show me how you would like a romantic evening to go .
oh , jack , wine and candles?
gosh , it's not even our anniversary .
come here , hot stuff .
yes , yes .
oh , jack .
jack?
down here , under the bed .
down here , greg .
wow .
have a seat .
watch the panel .
this is incredible .
so this is like your , uh , mobile command center for all your spy activities?
mainly a secure space for me to spend some alone time and reflect on my thoughts .
mmm .
very cool .
greg .
yeah?
you'll recall , we had a discussion earlier in the week regarding my feelings about family , legacies , children and so forth .
oh , yeah , of course i recall .
yeah .
i'm going to just ask you once .
is there anything you want to tell me regarding things that might have happened?
unplanned things?
things involving the fruit of your loins?
no .
well , if he's not going to admit it on his own ...
hello?
hello , jorge?
it's jack byrnes , remember me?
oh , yeah .
sure .
you came to the house with bernie .
you had that fancy camera pen .
yeah , that's right .
listen , do you have any plans tonight?
uh , no .
good , 'cause i'd like to invite you to a party .
# you could feel like dancin '#
# dance #
# and you could feel like fallin '#
# fall #
# 'cause it would be all right ##
hey .
sweetie .
having a good time?
uh , no , not really .
no?
hey , listen , sweetie , did you tell your mother i'm pregnant?
because she keeps touching my stomach and smiling like that .
yeah .
no , i didn't tell her .
she just , she guessed .
she what?
yeah , and then she told my dad .
oh , my god .
stop it , bernie .
bernie , stop .
it's not funny .
i told my mom .
what?
yeah .
what?
why'd you ...
your dad will definitely find out .
she knows my dad .
she'd never say a word .
no , no .
but he's very suspicious .
greg .
hi .
hey .
hi .
honey , would you take this to your mother?
it's a wine spritzer .
that's all she drinks now .
you boys have fun .
nice .
nice party .
isn't it?
yeah , it is .
it's nice .
it's got a nice festive vibe .
you met some of the , uh , some of the cousins?
i met some .
yes .
i met some , um ...
dom .
yeah , dom focker .
that's my dad's , uh , first cousin .
did you meet his kids , randy and horny?
i've met randy and horny .
yes .
come on .
i want to introduce you to somebody .
come on .
oh , there he is .
glad you could make it , jorge .
oh , hey , thanks for the invite , mr. b.
greg , this is jorge villalobos .
hey .
hey , how you doing?
isabel's son .
oh , i didn't realize isabel had a son .
when did she get married?
she she's not married .
oh , he's never met his father .
oh .
i'm sorry .
that's , i mean , that's ... that's too bad .
oh , no , no , it's ... it's cool .
my mom said my dad wasn't like , mature enough to deal with a kid , anyway , so , yeah .
so how do you guys know each other?
oh , this young man is quite the mechanic .
and he's only 15 years old .
isn't that impressive?
really?
you're 15?
yeah .
that is impressive .
he's a handsome kid , huh?
yeah .
almost like a young , half hispanic marlon brando .
well ,
i'll leave you two guys to talk .
you probably have a lot in common .
well , hmm .
so you're 15 .
come on , let's conga .
did you order the tom collins , sir?
is it made with fresh lemon juice?
they're bermuda lemons , sir .
and i squeezed them myself .
stay safe , santa .
i mean , it's romantic out here , don't you think?
the moon , the sea , isn't it nice?
hmm .
yeah , it's nice .
you look very handsome tonight , jack .
oh .
thank you , honey .
what are you doing to my ears?
nothing .
hey !
i have to go to the bathroom , i'll be right back .
okay .
hello , greg .
hi , jack .
did you have a nice conversation with your son?
jack , i've never even met that kid before .
focker , you've been covering this up from the very beginning .
no , i haven't , jack .
it's just another one of your crazy theories .
greg .
you're still in the circle of trust , so i'm gonna give you one more chance .
are you ready to admit that you've been hiding this from pam?
no , i haven't .
you're not hiding anything?
no , all right?
oh , greg .
what are you holding?
what's in your hand?
nothing .
jack , i can see it in the mirror .
what is it?
you got something in your hand .
don't worry about it , greg .
is that a needle?
yes , it is .
you seem tense .
i was going to offer you a sedative .
you're joking , right?
no , i'm not .
jack .
is that tartar sauce on your shoulder?
tartar sauce?
why?
you've been injected with a highly concentrated dose of sodium pentothal .
truth serum .
you won't recall this in a few minutes and tonight , for the first time in your life , my young friend , you are going to be honest .
keep the pressure on it .
get down , little jack .
get funky .
oh .
hey there , preggers .
quiet .
how're you doin '?
fine , where've you been?
i went to the bathroom to pee and now i'm talking to you , my fiance , who i've delayed marrying for two years because i didn't want our parents to meet .
what?
what?
you don't like me?
it's okay .
i don't like your little red outfit .
makes you look like a little demon baby .
maybe i'll get you a little pitchfork for christmas , huh , so we can put you on a can of underwood ham .
i'm sorry that i can't make little " poop " sounds and i can't make little things that tell people when i wanna do things .
and guess what?
i can make a sign to you , too .
how's that for a sign?
uh oh .
look , bernie's gone up on the stage .
come .
now , to say a few words , one of the great registered nurses of all time ,
gaylord myron focker .
come on , let's give it up to gay .
give it up to him .
bernie focker !
i love the shirt , dad .
thank you .
all right .
it's great to be here with all of you as i am about to set sail in my ship of life , with my first mate , the beautiful young blonde lass over there .
hey , baby .
i love you , honey .
i still masturbate to pam .
greg .
what?
it's true .
honey , what?
come on , you're hot .
look at her .
look at those boobs .
man !
i just wanna ...
i just wanna lather them up with soap and just ...
i love it .
man , i just wanna ... just wanna nestle in there and just take a little vacation in there .
honey .
honey , what?
i'm sorry .
okay , excuse me for you being perfect .
hey , you know who else is great?
that woman over there .
my future mother in law , dina byrnes .
# dina , dina , fofina #
# banana fana fofina #
# i love di di dina #
# byrnes ##
you know , they say if you really wanna know what a woman will look like when she gets older , you should look at her mother .
well , i'm a lookin 'and i'm a likin '.
look at her !
sweetness !
hmm mmm .
good genes , the byrnes gene pool .
hey , hey , you .
yeah , you .
hold on .
pam , i gotta tell you something about ... about this little dude right here .
in my first really passionate sexual awakening ,
i did , in fact , lose my virginity to our beautiful housekeeper , isabel .
greg , honey , that was in the past .
so why don't you come sit down?
no , no , honey , 'cause i have to get this off my chest , really .
sit .
we conceived a child .
and his name is jorge villalobos .
come up here , jorge .
come up here .
let's lift the veil of mystery .
the fruit of my loins is right here .
everybody take a look .
see his face .
he's mine .
search your feelings , jorge .
you know it to be true .
it's okay .
i know .
i know .
lot of information .
you let it settle .
who'd have thunk it , huh?
come on , give that kid a hand .
oh , and , uh , jack?
pam's pregnant .
focker out .
hey .
hey .
what happened last night?
well , you got drunk and told my dad i'm pregnant .
you revealed you have a 15 year old son named jorge .
and , oh , apparently you have the hots for my mom .
oh , my god .
l ...
i ...
you mean , is that really true?
i think she's attractive .
no , that you have a son you never told me about .
i ...
honey , if it is ,
i never heard about it before last night .
isabel never said anything to me .
l ...
i ...
i mean .
i don't even remember drinking .
you're telling me the truth , aren't you?
of course , i am .
pam ,
i love you .
i would never lie to you about anything like that .
i love you , too .
and if jorge really is your son , then we will make it work .
okay .
i ...
hey , how did your dad react to the pregnancy news?
well , just as you'd expect .
he slept in the rv .
he hasn't spoken to anyone since last night .
pam , we have to leave this island .
get in the rv right now .
bernard , get out from under the vehicle or i will run you over .
i'm not moving , jack .
there's a non violent way to handle this .
what's going on?
well , your father wants to leave , and bernie is staging a sit in .
dad , come on , get up .
this is ridiculous .
you weren't around in the '60s , man .
this is how we got things done .
pam , dina , we have to get off this island .
it s evil .
jack byrnes , out of the rv .
you are acting like such a jerk .
yes , there you go .
jacko !
yes .
man , we're gonna have a grandchild .
come on , we should be celebrating .
how could you not see it?
greg is completely unfit to handle a child .
he's neglected his own son for 15 years .
hey , jack , i didn't even know he existed .
that's right .
who knows what to believe with you?
you're dishonest about everything .
you're so much better , jack?
why don't you tell everybody what you did last night to greg at the party .
muskrat , dina .
oh , stuff your muskrat , jack .
he shot greg with truth serum before his speech .
what?
yeah , i found this in his pocket .
here we go again , dad .
he did the same thing to pam's junior prom date .
wait a minute .
yes , yes .
wait a minute .
you stuck a needle in my neck .
you drugged my son?
i had no choice .
he refuses to tell the truth .
because he's terrified , and he thinks he has to impress you .
he's had us trying to impress you , but in my opinion ,
jack , i think it's you who should be trying to impress us .
jack .
you've insulted me , my wife , my son , our entire way of life .
i've sat back and taken it .
but now , you've crossed the line , sir .
and i'm gonna have to kick your ass .
dad , dad , wait a second .
i'm gonna teach this florist some justice , focker style .
just calm down .
just give me a minute to stretch .
bernie , you're gonna hurt yourself .
we can talk this through .
it's too late for words , rosalind .
dad , dad , no , no , please , no dance fighting .
stop !
this is capoeira , man .
this is hardcore shit .
bernard , if you continue , you will force me to engage you .
and once i begin the sequence of combat , it can only end with your demise .
bring it , dog .
come on .
bring it .
come on .
he's taunting me .
dad .
greg !
greg !
what , bernie , you're gonna snap now?
greg !
what?
now look what you did .
it's your fault .
he's bleeding .
he's bleeding , daddy .
that's it .
pam , dina ,
i'm calling a family conference .
come on .
no , dad , this is the family .
all right?
in a few weeks , i'm not gonna be pam byrnes .
i'm gonna be pamela focker .
or byrnes focker .
we haven't totally decided yet .
no , no , no , i'm gonna be pamela martha focker .
i know how that sounds , but ... but that's the name i'm taking .

i don't know what he said , but ...

on your belly .

you got a hearing problem?
no , i'm just trying to say ...
now we have two failures to comply .
now , i need the two of you to remain on the vehicle .
okay , now here's my plan .
plan?
dad , no .
that was just a joke .
i'm sorry .
i was ...
i was just trying to help you , gay .
i know , dad .
you're always trying to help .

his name is rusty bridges .
we al make mistakes , santa .

34 years spent reading other people and i get it all wrong .

i can really talk to , lj .
asshole .

f o c k e r.
hey , it's jack .
hey , jack .
wait !
jack !
jack .
halt .
jack .
jack .
jack .
weaver stance !
oh , my god .
you shot my son .
halt .
your son has merely been stunned by a less than lethal weapon .
remain calm .
50, 000 volts of electricity are now passing into your skeletal muscle tissue .
your central nervous system has been incapacitated but you will regain motor functions momentarily .
officer , do you mind telling me why you're arresting these men?
oh , mercy , it just gets better and better .
that is none of your business , looky loo .
return to your camper .
at ease , son .
put away the taser .
jack byrnes , cla .
c i what?
says here you're retired .
what'll you show me next , old timer , your aarp card?
now , you listen to me , and you listen good .
what's he doing?
don't worry , he'll get us out of this .
you have no right to ...
stand down , sir .
no , i will not stand down .
you will stand down .
i will not stand down .
you will stand down or you will be working security in a retirement home in point beach .
remain calm .
it's been almost an hour .
you think they caught up with him?
hmm .
sure , sweetheart .
if i know bernie , they're probably sitting in a caf in little havana eating chimichangas and working out their issues .
check it out .
he's got a rubber booby .
what's going on?
what's going on?
i was talking to judge goldfarb .
it's done , we're out .
i thought you were making a call .
we don't need it .
i ran into the judge in the hall .
i took care of everything .
yeah , right .
what're you saying , jack?
i'm saying , if you had kept your mouth shut in the first place we wouldn't be in this mess .
i'm a lawyer , jack .
i'm trying to get us out of here .
what'd you do , give the judge your fondue recipe?
at least i'm comfortable enough in my own skin to cook for my family .
when's the last time you gave your wife breakfast in bed?
when is the last time you gave her anything in bed?
now you're out of line , focker .
you're out of line , man .
no , you hurt my feelings there , and there's no reason to hurt my feelings .
would you guys stop?
he insulted me .
well , this isn't about you , all right?
it's not about either of you .
it's about me and pam .
we're getting married .
that's it .
we're starting our own circle of trust .
and guess what?
you're not in it .
oh , you can't start a circle of trust .
it's my circle .
you don't have a patent on the circle , jack .
by the way , you're not even in your own circle right now .
that is untrue .
i say who's in or out of the circle .
well , i'm confused .
whose circle am i in?
nobody's .
look , we're starting a family , okay?
we we're gonna have a baby .
i have a 15 year old son .
you guys gotta put aside your issues and ... and do what's best for us .
okay?
greg , jorge is not your son .
what?
i had a comparative dna analysis done last night .
and i made a mistake .
you made a mistake?
yes , i did .
wait a minute .
truth serum , dna matches .
who the hell are you , jack byrnes?
i'm not really a florist , bernard .
i was in the cla for 32 years .
and i retired right before i met greg .
oh , sure .
well , that makes sense .
# bingo , bango , bongo ##
bernie , what the heck are you still doing here?
ira .
open up , let these guys out .
judge , what exactly did he say to you?
he didn't have to say anything .
dr. roz saved my marriage .
i'd do anything for that woman .
you tell sugar pants
i'll see her in class next week .
will do , ira .
thanks .
well , what can i say?
i'm married to a powerful woman .
all right , gentlemen .
let's go .
excuse me .
what?
can you close the cell door?
focker !
you want to remain in the cell?
we're not done talking yet .
what?
so , what do you think , huh?
hmm?
can we work this out or not?
okay .
jack?
uh ...
good enough .
all right , then , uh ,
i think pam and i should ... should get married this weekend .
this weekend?
oh , i'm not so sure that's a good idea .
you wanna be in the circle or not , jack?
okay , we'll do it this weekend .
oh , jack .
hey , i think i can get judge ira to marry you guys .
oh , i don't think so .
but if it's all right with you , greg ,
i already have a minister in mind .
# if i were a carpenter #
# and you were a lady ##
oh my god , daddy .
you didn't !
meeting greg made such an impression on kevin , he spent eight months in israel on a kibbutz , then he took an internet course and got ordained as an inter faith minister .
jack told me you were okay with me conducting the ceremony .
i hope that's true .
yeah , yeah , no , i think it's great .
i mean , it is a little weird .
you listen to me when i say this .
pam and i didn't have one tenth of the spiritual connection that you two obviously share .
i mean , i look at you both together and you're beautiful .
i get it .
okay?
okay , thank you , kevin .
thank you , greg .
you're gonna be a great mom , pamcake .
thank you , daddy .
and who gives this woman to this man?
i do .
jack tiberius byrnes .
daddy .
sorry , greg .
she's all yours now .
that was sweet , honey .
are you all right?
shalom , everyone .
shalom .
which is hebrew for " what's going on?
let us begin with the blessing of the wine .
amen .
kevin .
what?
yeah , go ahead .
# crazy about my baby #
# crazy about my baby crazy about my baby #
mmm .
mmm .
well , hi .
rosalind .
yeah .
i just have to say i underestimated you .
oh .
when it comes to relationships
i'm starting to see that you might actually know what you're talking about .
i appreciate that , jack .
really , thank you .
i also was curious about the advice you gave judge ira .
mmm .
is that classified information?
i thought you'd never ask .
i'm gonna give you a crash course , okay?
come here .
really?
uh huh .
and i do that for how many minutes?
hey !
there's my brother from another mother .
congratulations , jacko .
put that away , bernard .
we're family now .
we're family .
now , if you'll excuse me ,
i have some unfinished business to take care of .
# i m crazy about my baby #
# i m crazy about my baby #
go get her , tiger .
we fockerized him .
sure did .
i'd like to fockerize you .
# crazy about you baby #
# crazy about you baby #
# i know you're crazy about me #
# who's gonna take my love away?
nobody #
# who's gonna take my love? #
# who's gonna take my love away? #
# who's gonna take my love? #
sweetheart , do we have to hurry like this?
honey , we're in a covert operation .
the bandleader told me we have 23 minutes before they cut the cake .
jack , what are you doing?
little trick bernie taught me .
# crazy about my baby #
# crazy about my baby crazy about my baby #
# crazy about my baby , my baby's crazy 'bout me #
# crazy about my baby , my baby's crazy 'bout me ##
now let's find out , lj , why the ferber method isn't working .
oh , hi , baby .
hi , little jack .
okay .
oh , look what i brought you .
oh , what did i bring?
a chocolate .
for the baby .
yummy , is that good?
i know you're not supposed to have this .
grandpa jack doesn't like chocolate .
but he's a little , you know , whacko .
don't tell him , okay?
you know what?
i got some cake in the refrigerator .
later i'i bring you that , okay?
chocolate cake .
good boy .
but don't tell anyone , okay?
one more .
you yell and scream al you want .
make noise , that's what this country's al about .
i think we've got a little protester on our hands .
oh , it figures ,
i should've known this was gonna go on .
always question authority .
you have to question everything el stiffo grandpa jack says .
you know why?
because 'he's full of ...
because he's full of ...
grandpa jack is full of ...
grandpa jack is full of ...
there he is .
little man jack .
how're you doing?
can i interest you in a little vodka?
just kidding .
i m , like , uh , officially your uncle now .
so i was thinking maybe i should give you some uncley advice .
you know , little hints for surviving in this family
'cause you gotta learn to keep secrets from your psycho grandpa jack .
he was really upset when you crawled out of the playpen .
which is why we never tell him that instead of watching you ,
i was actually out by the lagoon smoking a little reefer .
or that whole thing about pam being pregnant .
there's no little focker on the way .
whole thing was just made up so jack would let us get married .
but ...
you gotta do what you gotta do , right?
that's cute , that little alligator tchotchke thing .
what's that in its mouth?
it s got like a ... a camera !
busted .
hi , jack .
i knew you were there al along .
i was just , uh , doin 'a little show for you .
you know i don't smoke pot or anything , and pam is pregnant .
you should've seen the look on your face , though .
oh , so good .
asshole .
hey , look at me , jack , what am i?
i am a frozen caveman .
study me , jack .
learn how strange the focker genetic code is .
we are weird mutants who hug and kiss .
we show emotion .
jack must learn from us and chip away with his hammer of truth .
ha , focker .
wooga booga .
