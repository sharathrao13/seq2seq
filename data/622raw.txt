long ago in the reign of the king's richard the lionheart .
there was a legend known to all .
that's a man who stole from the rich to feed the poor
he was known throught out the reign .
as robin hood .
it is known that he and his band of merry men
played the evil share of nottingham .
and he romanced one heart of maid , marion .
there was more to their story .
a tale kept secret then forgotten .
lost in the maze of time and shifting memory .
for robin and marion , had a child .
what?
you gave me the orders to inform you moment the child is born .
my lord ,
shall it be a price on the infant's head my lord?
equal to the price set on its father .
robin hood shall not have a son .
to play the nottingham .
oh , the child is female ...
not a son?
are you sure is a daughter?
shall it be a price on the infant's head my lord?
a girl ...
gwyneth ,
let's no home come to her .
she'll be safe here , i'll promise .
how can i choose to you if you don't study?
you're the future churchman .
ls you not me .
i'm only stable because each cruises he said it could be his last
would you have your father refuses his king .
yes .
king richard should be here carrying for his people .
lnstead of abandoned his brother prince john
the injustice is here , not in jerusalem .

i do love him but he's like my brother but ...
uncle , i have to let him win at the archer just to spare him .
how can i think of him as a husband?
lf he pleases your father?
i can't get his pleasure or its opposite .
rain in england not like the rainbow in jerusalem
not the weather not does it no distance?
but how do we measure it?
i can count his visits from one hand ,
tuck friar !
robin is coming !
well , now you need two !
my bird its on it ways .
he could be several days .
don't worry he'll be fine .
why don't you just go to bed?
i understand how you feel .
you are an orphan .
you never knew your parents .
you can be as sad and angry as you like .
it doen't matter .
they are never coming back .
but he comes back and he goes away ...
he said he'll be back but not when .
he's my father and i haven't seen him in five years .
now see him now .

what about philip?
i thought he want his son to take the throne .

we'll meet philip at the back gate of harwich
my old friend friar benedict has arranged all .

i am so ungrateful sometime , please forgive me .
for the whole world ...
tuck said i should be beg pardon to my father for the way i've spoke .
we shouldn't be fighting each together ...
but fighting together .
side by side against king john , why can't he see !
i must do something , i will die before i've lives .
do you ever feel that?
yes ...
what stops you? ... i'm a coward .
he said that life is like a wild horse .
you ride it or its ride you .
suppose the wild horse doesn't want to be ridden .
are you after your destiny or slate your fear?
a man who doen't afraid of the wild creature is probably a fool .
i don't want to be afraid of anything ...
it is all arranged madam .
prince john's army will be waiting at harwich .
philip will be murder the minute he comes to shore .
prince john promised to pay my travel expenses .

wear it for my sake .
alright .
lf you were ill , who will look after me?
i don't feel the cold .
i don't feel much of anything right now .
not cold ... not hunger ... ... not even fear .
as if i'm dreaming .
or in my grave i wish to see my father before i die .
what could he tell me?
look at you conrad ,
victory rules .
controls the surrounding , fields and woods .
for all we know , let me be here ready for hiding .
will we find him .
any signs of robin?
all the main roads are being watched .
he doesn't travel on main road !
get them !
like one of his arrows .
look at the cabbages ...
the eggs ...
i should see you in prison !
how dare you?
i am sick of you !
your wife is baron .
a man who punished a hundred child has none of own .
tell the god , the boy is a thief .
let him go !
he has taken nothin '!
how dare you !

ls gwyn .
a strike of luck that what .
let's go .
for the benedict has arranged a meeting at the back gate of harwich .
but how do we know is robin hood?
mortal loves is but licking honey from the thorns
then he must replied ,
it is insolitude that marry is cumulated .
pretty thoughts , but i can't agree .
licking love honey no matter the danger?
ls more then a emtpy bed on a cold night .
you are a philosopher conrad .
no sir , i'm a lover .
i would trade food for love even if i was starving .
i have known a lots of women .

i can't think of one that i wouldn't trade for some meat ...
some bread ... and a decent ale ...
admit it , you're glad that i came .

really?
froderick stop it !
sorry .
these are good ...
but you shouldn't steal .
oh i see ,
your moral rises but your stomach failed .
no shame leaving it for the bird .
they taxes the poor until they can't feed their own children
and jailed them for stealing .
john's a thief , not them .
not me .
you could have ended up in prison .
my father stole from the rich and gave to the poor .
no prisons can't hold him .
you can never be like your father .
i didn't expected .
lf i were , would you like me better?
over here !

so what have you to say?
lf you not come i'll be dead or worst .
ls that what you want to hear?
i admitted and freely , please don't send me home .
does tuck know this?
i thought froderick would tell him but he followed me here
froderick too?
you hear that will?
where is he now?
he's meeting me in the chapel after dark .
we split up , so i can get away .
i don't understand , why are you running from those men?
i ...

i stole some pies from the baron
and altogether he was too fat and the children were hungrey .
a thief?
many thanks girl .
you took the guards from their post and gave us ...
well ... there's no help now .
you have to stay here until one of us can take you back .

you will sit exactly where you are !
and you will not dis obey me again .

and no danger for you?
i'm bigger and stronger
but not more faster and more cunning .

not too glory , not too french ...

and shut the door !
the different of look of richard around the mouth
oh god ... the thing i forced to do ...
you deserved too be king .
i am happy we have suceeded .
this is not philip !
do i have to spelt it out to you?
do i have to write it down?
i'm surrounding by idiots !
i made one simple request !
kill one prince !
possible !
must i have to do everything?
i when to nottingham for myself
where is philip?
does he mean the young philip or the old philip ...
i haven't seen it either .
i'll have your heads on the steak !
maybe ... he means philip the map maker .
philip the map maker ... no ...
that's not the one you meant it is?
i mean philip the son of my brother !
what does he look like?
prepare the rag .
yes .
he's still alive ,
i'm in nottingham ls best we part here
i'm on the king buisness .
the king employed you to steal horses?
he employed a man to protect his son philip .
i'm afraid that man is in prison .
lf you are talking about robin hood , let him be there .
he has betrayed his king and plotted philip's death .
may god strike you down for repeated such a lie !
he let the prince into a trap this very day !
not robin hood !
you might believe me !
not with my own eyes .
i watched with my eyes
i saw robin hood taken prisoner !
and who are you pretending to know philip !
conrad , i was the prince's valet .
what?
no !
john will act as a king will hang robin hood and scarlett .
we have to get them out of prison .
conrad say you help me please !
a woman dressed as a man?
and me ...
prince's valet against john's army?
you are frighten?
better alive coward than a dead fool !
you don't understand .
robin hood is my father .
he won't kill us yet until he found the boy .
or john is wearing the crown .
the only way is wait for news of king richard death .
it wasn't gwyn's fault rob .
we walked into it .
she's a good girl .
i know .
we should have brought her along .
i should have say yes .
she was right .
i should have told her that .
i ordered philip dead !
did i get philip dead?
i did not !
that was my honest mistake my lord .
honest mistake?
honest mistake?
my life is in danger and you took a honest mistake?
are you mad?
or plain stupid?
what did i order?
philip's death sir .
what did i wanted?
philip sir .
the name of the man you must kill?
philip .
philip good !
ride to nottingham , inform your sheriff .
lf he doesn't send me philip's head .
i'll have his .
and yours ... on a plate !
well , two heads are better than one .
philip's death will be a great blown for his people .
the people don't love john .
he's move by greed and treat the subject like sheets of slaughter
surely one king is as good as a mix .
philip care nothing for the fair of state .
he only thought of wine and dancing .
believe me , england is better off .
you know nothing of life here you would't say that .
i rather have a fool than john .
don't mistake me , philip was not a fool .
ln fact he was quite the opposite .
he was a quick wit according to some .
he find favour with women and he was a fine sword man .
not average or not a bad fellow .
but no desire for a public life .
a child can prefer ...
a prince has no obligation to serve the people .
here archer ,
lf you don't hurry you won't make the tournament .
look at you , a woman and you preferred to be a man .
why shouldn't a prince take your part ...
archery tournament .

i hold the sheriff in exchange for prisoner
robin hood and will scarlett .
long live king richard .

they called them selves forest people .
that's green , the taxes people drove him crazy
mary duff ,
when she couldn't pay .
they put out her father eyes
this is prince john rules .
now i began to understand your system .
we're not bothering about system .
did gwyn tell you we were ...
no , it just ... you seem so close .
gwyn you must eat .
all this suffering , i just want to change it .
more then philip would have done i can remind you .
philip was chosen by richard , who was a good ruler .
lf he was alive he would have brought peace to england .
i know it .
why do you stare?
do you always wear men's clothes?
no , of course not .
it just i wanted to ride with my father .
keeping me safe .
he was alway at war .
as i child i hated it .
i think it's because i longed for him .
where is he now?
he's dying .
conrad i'm so sorry .
philip was very lucky to have a friend like you .
gwyn what did he say?
nothing .
i don't trust him .
he doesn't act like a man servant .

i'm serious .
he could be spy from king john .
some water , some water .
froderick !

you fell asleep , how could you?
i didn't , he tricked me .
he was tied to a tree .

he asked for water that all .
my knife .
we had a hostage , our best chance .
froderick lets the sheriff escaped .
stop it , gwyn can't you see he's hurt?
lf my father hanged , i will never speak to you again .
the sheriff won't be back .
we should head for the abbey .
no , i promise gwyn i would free her father .

who would ride with me .
morning robin hood .
ah , i trust you slept well , slept like a baby .
ah , breakfast in the reck room .

where's philip?
you have egg in your beard .
i come here trying to makes friend .
straight him until he talks .
philip is alive .
philip lives , tell everyone .
send the messager ahead of us .
they must double the guard around the tower .
a girl and a handful of monks , my lord?
you don't trap for a bear when catching a mouse
you didn't see this mouse .
spliting image of her father .
his skills ... and the disrespect of the lord .
she will know fear and death .
i'll teach her both !
but first philip must die .
long lives king john !
back to london !
forgive me froderick .
alright .
please !
i can't bear it when we are not friend .
i am sorry , i was wrong .
you were hurt , conrad is right?
conrad?
yes?
now don't pretend , i know you like him .
stop it?
what?
you like him don't deny it .
i know you better than you know yourself .
you say so .
it doen't matter .
i told him not to think of me as a woman and he obey me very well .
so let's that be the end of it .
i've seen the way he looks at you and believe me ...
he sees you as a woman .
what?
maybe he believes that you also in love of someone esle .
i didn't exactly told him the truth .
oh froderick , i'm sorry .
i'm always apologising to you .
maybe that's the problem .
would you like me better if i just grab you?
threw you down and kiss you from head to toe?
go a head , tell him we're just best friend .
i'm your best friend aren't we?
are you afraid?
aren't you?
their army are well trained and we aren't .
my father said there're no courage about fear .
these people are the ones with courage .
to rise each morning to face the lost of their land .
to see the children hungrey .
their lives stock stolen .
and they don't give up .
they are the heroes .
froderick told me what he said to you .

prince john's men are still seaching for philip , he alive .

conrad saw philip died .
conrad is lying , he's a traitor .
a spy for prince john
ls not true .
lf conrad say philip dead , he's dead
and everything else is a lie !
philip is alive .
philip thought if people believes he was dead ,
he'll be safe .

king richard's son can not be such a coward .

but he has changed .
he see things differently now .

i think prince john's strength has given me longer arms .
lsn't it time you retire to your country?
well , i can pray to god on your grave .
my lord , 50 pieces the bull eye should be easy for you .
and an end for robin hood .
ls a good shot .
found him with glory and give him yet a brighter crown

ln the name of king richard do not crown this man .
who is this man?

i am philip , son of richard the lionheart .
i was chosen by him as the successer .
as prove ,
here is the ring given to me by my father .
your father the absented king richard's son?
i will wear the crown .
i am rightful air by blood .
i am the rightful king !
by lord !
there are higher lord for men like you .
you could never be king .
i have seen what your army and your tax men has done to the villages
they are suffering from your production of greed and your fear .
how dare you !
you draw a sword against your king .
arrest this man !
arrest him !
step forward and defend your king .
i command it !
why aren't you move?
you define me for him !

miserable , contemptible , cowards !
you're all guilty of high treason !
everyone one of you !
you and you !
and you !
all of you !
it's over !
the people won't do what you asked .
cos they won't fight for you anymore .
your days is at and end .
give me my father's crown sir .
this is ridiculous .
history will ignore you .
i'm at your service , your majesty .
did froderick tell you ,
that i've made him a member at my castle?
he's off learning spanish to improve foreign relation .
he's very happy .
winfred of lancaster , i hardly know you .
you will be king and i am a commoner .
i will not take the throne .
they will despite you if you did .
i would despite myself .
your highness ,
come , before they speak lattin and pour oil on my head ...
let's us be it once more .
even if it only for an hour .
or a minute .
one minute .
ls not fair .
the king should have everything he wants .
that's what i used to say when my father goes off the war .
ls not fair ,
why does he loves richard more than his own daughter .
i didn't understand ,
it wasn't richard he loves , it was something much bigger ...
something held inside himself , like a priest carrying its faith .
what i decided , i don't want to be a cause on another man pain
which is why ...
i will serve you like my father served your father .
from this day forward and forever ...
yes , your majesty .
say it , please ...
from this day forward and forever .
good day , miss lockely .
good day , yours highness .
i was wondered where you were .
froderick said i'll find you in here .
ls a quite place to think .
never had much quite in my life .
you mother fell in love with a robber and a thief .
princess just as bad if not wrost .
look at me gwyn ,
look at me .
i did what i thought was right .
i kept away , and i let you grow up alone
because i want to protect you from the life that i lead .
ls nothing wrong with the life you lead .
no there isn't ... for me .
i wanted something better for you .
ln the end it didn't makes any different did it?
you grew up to be just like me anyway .
so i'm not saying we'll start again but just ..
start ... partners .
you know father umm ... ... daughter .
on condition though , you'll take orders from me .
i promise .
we'll serve the king together .
i know .
history may have forgotten the reign of philip
and the richard of lionheart .
but this much is known , that philip never marry .
he pledged his heart to a woman of no birth right .
the daughter of a thief and a lady ...
a common woman of uncommon value ...
she was called gwyn .
