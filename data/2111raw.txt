in 1536 . . . fleeing from the inquisition , the alchemist uberto fulcaneili disembarked in veracruz , mexico .
appointed officiai watchmaker to the viceroy ,
fulcaneili was determined to perfect an invention which would provide him with the key to eternai iife .
he was to name it . . . the cronos de vice .
4 00 years ia ter , one night in 1937 , part of the vault in a building collapsed .
among the victims was a man of strange skin , the color of marble in moonlight .
his chest mortally pierced , his last words ...
suo tempore .
this was the alchemist .
the authorities located the residence of the dead man .
what they found there was never fully revealed to the public .
after a brief investigation , the mansion and its contents were sold at public auction .
never on any list or inventory was the cronos device mentioned .
as far as anyone knew , it never existed .
only a few days left .
tickets are running out for the big new year's dance ...
hey , how can i help you?
good morning .

good evening .

over some broken glass .
you won't need any stitches .
blood is so messy .
remember when aunt marge died?
everyone was soaked in blood and she was spotless .
but really dead .
there's something here .
it's going to hurt .
good thing you warned me .
almost .
it was buried deep .
what is it?
i don't know , some sort of metal shaving .
no , it's more like a sting ... from a bee , i don't know .
please , please , please .
be very careful with my soul , please .
our father , who art in heaven , hallowed be thy name .
thy kingdom come , thy will be done , on earth as it is in heaven .
give us this day our daily bread ...
i'm fine , honey .
i'm all right .
i'm all right .

that's how i feel .
where's aurora?
you don't eat breakfast?
i'm not hungry .
hey , do you like it or not?

well ... that's really nice .
de la guardla enterprlses
hello , mr. gris ...
how are you?
you ... destroyed my store .
i'm not the one you want to talk to .
the red ones are especially good today .
you don't know what you're getting yourself into .
almost 40 years ago ...
i found this manuscript .
40 years ago .
they are the notes , the hermetic annotations of a 1 6th century alchemist .
it's a fascinating book written backwards in latin .
it talks about a peculiar mechanism , an invention that extends its user's life .
but it has rules , precise rules , very strict , on how to use it .
an insect?
that's the master stroke .
the insect is trapped inside the invention .
like a sort of ...
living filter .
you believe it?
i mean , after so many years .
who says insects aren't
god's favorite creatures?
christ walked on water , just like a mosquito .
the resurrection concept is not foreign to ants , or to spiders .
they could survive inside a rock for hundreds of years ... until someone comes along and sets them free .
sure .
it's very educational , but i don't see why you're telling me this .
i'm dying , mr. gris .
i'm going to show you something .
the scalpel has been eating me alive ,
little by little .
chemotherapy , radiotherapy , psychotherapy ...
look closely , my friend , half of my body is here , inside this display case .
and the other half ... it's already in the menu .
or it's being chewed as we speak .
no .
it's mine .
you used it?
you used it?
just by accident .
what an imbecile .
angel .
here i am , uncle .
here i am .
oh , mr. gris .
my uncle is getting impatient .
de la guardia ...
we both lose something .
so ... you finally got your ... whatever it is .
mr. gris?
you may continue the game .
after all , you have the toy .
but i'm keeping the instructions .
and i won't relent .
this can't be possible .
it can't be possible , damn it .
aurora , my god .
aurora?
i know you've got it .
aurora?
aurora?
are you scared?
you think something will happen to me?
are you comfortable back there?
it already happened to me once , with your dad .
you remember him , at least a little?
yes ...
i believe you do .
when he was your age , he heard something or someone speak about those who die of lung cancer .
so , when i came back from work ,
i found out that my cigarettes had disappeared .
after searching all day , i get in the bathroom and i find a bunch of little bits of tobacco , floating in the toilet .
just bits .
i think he understood that breaking my cigars didn't help the matter at all .
but at least it made it clear to me that he was worried .
and it made it clear to him that it made it clear to me .
you know ...
i don't know what's happening to me .
but i think it's better if we stay together .
jesus?
just a minute .
i need you to help me .
just a minute .
hurry , honey , we'll be late .
who are you , little one?
a god?
you're so good to me .
i don't understand why i can't zip up this dress , it's the same one i wore at last year's dance .
i'm almost done .
how could i change so much in such a short time?
remember this?
lf i remember?
# no , i can't accept it's all over #
# that life set us apart ... #
lf i remember?
i always think about the first time i saw you , how i thought you would never pay attention to me .
i felt like such a nobody that ...
that's what architects call " vectors .
it's the little things that support the big things .
how are they supported?
the fact is that the pillars ...
teacher , can you see ...?
ln a minute , manuel .
cheers .
cheers .
cheers .
money and love .
cheers .
what's wrong?
eh?
ls something wrong?
no , i'll be right back .
where are you going?
i'll get something to drink .
it's the heat .
it happens to me all the time .
ls it better?
yeah .
every time i drink , i have to pee .
... since i was a kid .
what a decadent party , damn it .
let's see , let's see ... fuck this .
look at what they've done here .
it must have been an argentinean gate crasher or some peruvian on the loose .
motherfucker .
i'm working my ass off all year for a party ...
let's go .
nine ... eight ... seven ... six ... five ... four ... three ... two ... one ...
it's been a pleasure , an honor for radio dla ... to bring to your home , the classic remote broadcast of the yearly tigers club party .
always thinking of you , and wishing that all your dreams come true and that all those goals you have set reach the happiest of results through the purest of roads .
here , in this booth at htlm we feel honored , overwhelmed ...
yes , why not?
overwhelmed with joy to be able to serve you , to answer your calls .
mrs. lorenza from la colonia los jardines de la luz sends warmest regards to all the family and wishes happy times for everyone .
mrs. lupita raquel sends us a wish of glory to god in heaven and peace on earth for the people of goodwill .
how beautiful ...
we're dead ...
happy new year .
tell me where it is or my uncle won't leave me alone .
what is it exactly ... this thing?
what the fuck does the old man want it for?
he never told you?
you all think i'm stupid , don't you?
he thinks that will help him to extend his life .
that fucker does nothing but shit and piss all day , and he wants to live longer?
leave me alone .
do whatever you have to do , but leave me alone .
of course , sir .
i will leave you , when ... and if ... it pleases me .
get it?
get up .
get up .
fuck !
fuck !
how quiet .
all this blood , my god .
all this blood is mine .
i'm dying .
how weird .
everything is upside down and i'm dying ... alone .
alone .
don't let me die today .
oh , it hurts so bad .
i can resist a lot longer ... a lot longer .
oh , aurora .
great , tito .
great .
the forehead is coming out perfect .
like nothing ever happened .
it's your best work .
you bet .
it has its secrets .
here i'm giving form ... texture ...
i'm giving it color ...
they think i'm a fucking artist .
yeah ... but don't work on it too hard , we're going to cremate him .
what?
motherfucker , what do you mean " cremate him "?
you should have told me .
i wouldn't have dolled him up , fucker .
god , rest in peace .
it seems no one respects my work here .
why don't they tell me?
you , why didn't you tell me?
huh?
the widow changed her mind .
it seems the guy didn't have anything prepared .
no tomb , no grave , nothing .
they're all the same .
eternal , the fuckers .
plastic surgery , contrary to
fuck .
yes , uncle .
get up here immediately .
stupid motherfucker cocksucking son of a bitch asshole pendejo .
i want to know what happened .
i'll be right there .
shit .
i can't blow this .
i didn't touch him , the car skidded .
went off the cliff .
you imbecile !
uncle ...
what about his heart?
what about it?
did you hurt it in any way?
i told you i didn't touch him !
his car skidded , it went off the cliff ...
did you check his heart?
it wasn't beating .
did anything accidentally pierce it?
what's the difference?
he's dead .
it makes all the difference , all the difference !
oh , you clumsy beast .
you can't do anything right .
after all these years i thought there might be hope for you .
but you're useless , useless .
you probably ruined the whole thing by now .
how can somebody be deader than dead?
you know nothing about dying .
i don't understand .
no , you don't understand .
and you'll remain that way .
but there is one last thing you still have to do , and you better do it right because i'm not going to rest till i have what is rightfully mine .
and neither are you .
look at you ...
was the wake fun?
you're not going to heaven like that , right?
naked ... kisses everywhere , they'll know you were out fucking around .
come on , compadre .
funeral director : ... 1 5 minutes ago .
come in , this is your house .
tito , mr. de la guardia is ... was a friend of the deceased .
he wants to see the body ... one last time .
sure , medium or well done?
ohh ...
hello?
yeah?
mercedes ...
that's for me?
dear mercedes ...
i write this lines with great difficulty .
i want you to know that ... somehow , someway ,
i'm still alive .
and it hurts me to be alive .
the thirst is burning me , and i feel indifferent about everything ... the day ... this house ... and you .
aurora is staying with you , she ... will leave you this letter .
by the time you read it ...
i would have been gone to settle some kind of date , an unfinished business .
since i lost everything , at least i want to understand why .
just today
i realize how much i miss you .
i hope to see you when i come back , and that you want to see me no matter in what kind of shape i am .
loves you ...
jesus .
aurora ...
my god , what are you doing here?
i told you not to come .
put that away .
don't you see they could kill us?
don't you see we're in danger?
it works?
i knew you would return .
lf you're looking for the missing pages , you're wasting your time .
i ate them .
best meal i've had in years .
you talk about eternity , look at me , look at my skin .
it's decomposing , it's falling off piece by piece .
peel it off .
what are you talking about?
peel it off .
look .
what's happening to me?
you've been reborn .
what the fuck is it now , you dried up old prune?
what's this , why the new skin?
and don't answer in riddles .
you talk about insects , alchemists , artifacts .
but what is it that i need?
blood .
human?
of course .
you can't gain eternity with a cow or a pig .
i can destroy the artifact , pulverize it .
as you wish .
lf the device goes , you go .
but ... we can share ...
eternity .
what do i care about eternity?
i don't want to be eternal , i just want to get out of this .
that's even better .
there is a way out .
but first , the device .
i don't trust you .
i don't see you have a choice .
give me that , darling .
come on , i know what i'm doing .
you first .
my way out .
as you wish .
you don't even bleed right .
and now the heart ...
my god , aurora .
uncle?
talk to me ...
let's go now ... let's go .
please .
merry christmas .
merry christmas .
mine , mine ... everything is mine .
mine , mine , mine .
angel ...

you kept me waiting long enough .
you ...
fuck ... not my nose again .
this has to end .
oh , mr. gris ... now i have to kill you again .
ha !
mr. gris ...
go .
go ...
come here , precious .
come here .
angel .
what the fuck does it take to kill you?
you'll lose more than i will .
mine is only pain .
