my children ... from the very beginning ... it was the children who gave me my power .
the springwood slasher ... that's what they called me .
my reign of terror was legendary .
dozens of children would fall by my blades .
then the parents of springwood came for me ...
taking justice into their own hands .
when i was alive , i might have been a little naughty ... but after they killed me ,
i became something much , much worse the stuff nightmares are made of .
the children still feared me ... and their fear gave me the power to invade their dreams .
and that's when the fun really began !
until they figured out a way to forget about me ... to erase me completely !
being dead wasn't a problem .
but being forgotten now , that's a bitch !
it's only a dream !
die , motherfucker !
i can't come back if nobody remembers me !
i can't come back if nobody's afraid !
i had to search the bowels of hell ... but i found someone ... someone who'll make 'em remember .
he may get the blood , but i'll get the glory .
and that fear is my ticket home .
mike?
is that you?
all right , fuck you , then .
i'm heading in .
mike?
come on , it's not funny anymore .
no !
jason .
i should've been watching them , not drinking ... not meeting a boy at the lake .
i deserve to be punished .
we all deserved to be punished .
jason .
my special , special boy .
do you know what your gift is?
no matter what they do to you ... you cannot die .
you can never die .
you've just been sleeping , honey .
but now the time has come to wake up .
mommy has something she wants you to do .
i need you to go to elm street .
the children have been very bad on elm street .
rise up , jason !
your work isn't finished !
hear my voice and live again !
make them remember me , jason .
make them remember what fear tastes like .
i've been away from my children for far too long .
marry , fuck , or kill?
your choices are your choices are the three stooges .
go , kia .
oh , god ...
which one had the super bad toupee hair?
harry , mar
no !
no , no , no .
it was moe .
either one , i'd kill him .
ok , who'd you fuck , then?
this is stupid , y'all .
come on .
come on .
oh , god .
whatever , look .
i'd fuck the bald guy , and i'd marry larry .
jesus .
is this what we're doing all night?
'cause , y'all , this is really stank .
hey !
gibb , what are you doing?
i thought you were gonna quit .
i only smoke when i drink now .
but you're always drinking .
yeah , well , i'll work on that next .
hey , ok .

fred , scooby , or shaggy?
oh !
i'm not answering that and neither is she .

oh , my god .
oh , please , kia , what you need is a lobotomy .
i think i'm gonna get some candles .
i'm gonna get some beer .
do you guys want anything?
are you sure you should be driving?
i'm so under the limit , lori .
surprise .
oh , trey .
you answered my prayers .
thank you .
whoa , babe !

listen , you gotta be quiet .
hey , we knew you were be here all alone this weekend .
blake's cute .
he's not my type .
oh !
who is?
no one's ever gonna live up ... to the fuzzy memory of your first love , lori .
you were fucking fourteen , so get over it .
yeah , i know we were young ... but what will and i had was real .
well , correct me if i'm wrong ... but didn't mr. real just drop kick your ass ... without so much as a good bye handshake?
he ever even call or maybe even write to you after he moved?
send you an e mail?
no .
you see my point?
it's time to leave the convent , lori .
you need to meet a guy .
hey , lori ...
i like the ... flow of your place .

yeah .

oh , oh !
oh , you should see her bedroom !
hmm?
great flow in there .
lori , why don't you go upstairs and show blake your feng shui?
shut up !
i got a kink in my neck .
come on .
you can massage it out for me .
i think i need a few more drinks ... before there'll be any massaging .
what do you see in him?
i don't know , but he has a cute ass .
babe , don't make me ask you twice , ok?
so , lori ... am i gonna get that grand tour or what?
yeah .
you know , why don't you start in the kitchen ... and get us some beers?
cool .
oh , my god , kia , he is a total idiot .
get him out of here .
oh , lori , come on , give him a chance .
i don't like him .
you know what?
you don't like anybody .
i mean , lori , you've barely gone out since
since what?
since my mom died?
yeah , well , you know what?
my dad needs me .
so i can't just go out with guys all the time ... and if i did , it would not be with somebody like blake .
yeah , fuck me , baby !
your back door was open .
i closed it .
mmm .
babe , you know i don't like to be touched after , ok?
fine .
i'll go have a shower then .

asshole .
trey !

help us !
help us !
oh , my god !

you kids need some assistance?
what the fuck do you think? !
we need to lock this down now .
keep it contained , you hear me?
killed in bed .
jesus .
it's even the same damn house .
1428 elm .
it's gotta be him , right?
it's gotta be freddy krueger .
hey !
don't even say ... that son of a bitch's name out loud .
let's just keep it together .
we've been through too much to let this thing spread now .
take all the kids down to the station .
keep them separate .
do it now .
yes , sir .
we'll be in touch .
thank you .
let's go home .
so?
she doesn't know anything .
none of them do .
i'm pretty sure we're good .

what do you mean?
good work there tonight , stubbs .
right place , right time .
but we'll take it from here , all right?
your father's on his way .
do they know who did this?
no , not yet .
but i thought i heard ... one of the officers mention a name .
you know , to tell you the truth , lori ...
i i just moved here about a month ago ... but if they have a suspect , i'd be the first to know .
but they asked me all these really weird questions ...
iike about my dreams
what was the name?
what was the name?
freddy .
hello?
are you ok?
his name is freddy krueger ... and he loves children , especially little girls .
freddy's coming back .
soon he'll be strong enough .
it's ok to be afraid .
we were all afraid .
warn your friends .
warn everyone .
one , two , freddy's coming for you
three , four , better lock the door
five , six , grab a crucifix
seven , eight , try to stay up late
nine , ten , never sleep again
one , two , freddy's coming for you ...
blake , we have to talk .
what the hell were you doing over there?
you were supposed to be watching your sister .
were you drinking?
my best friend was just killed , dad !
so how about giving me some fucking space?
you watch yourself , boy .
i'm gonna get him for you , trey .
cop let it slip .
it was somebody named freddy .
i'm gonna take him out myself , trey .
i swear to god .
who is that?
someone there?
jesus .
i'm ok .
i'm all right .
not strong enough yet .
well , i will be soon enough .
until then ...
i'll let jason have some fun .
dad?
hypnocil .
what does this shit do , anyway?
how come we all have to take it?
it keeps you nice and docile while i kick your little ass .
i'm fine with that .
we interrupt this program for a special report .
after tonight's murder ... in this neighborhood of springwood ... the sheriff's department has confirmed ... that there is one victim ...
hey , turn that up , man .
remain sketchy , but the sheriff
sorry , will .
you know the rules .
turn that back on .
i know somebody that lives in that house .
come on , turn it back on , man !
i never ask for anything .
just turn on the fucking tv , please !
fuck you , man !
what the fuck is your problem?
what are you doing , man?
you want 10ccs of that pink tranquilizer in your ass?
that was lori's house .
they said something about a murder .
i gotta go to her .
i gotta see if she's ok .
back to springwood?
do you want me to start having nightmares again?
don't start with that dream demon shit again .
ok?
you know that's all just in your head .
yeah , yeah , and who are you , the poster boy for sanity?
you're the one that told the cops ...
lori's dad killed his wife .
yeah , right , and now it looks like someone else ... got killed in the same house .
you think that's a coincidence?
two murders in one house?
kurt , how many times do i have to tell you , man?
i don't do checkers .
i'm an uno guy , all right?
so go grab the fucking uno deck and we'll play , ok?
please .
thank you .
look at us , will .
look around you , man .
we're institutionalized .
we're stuck here .
we're not going anywhere .
i do miss my family , man .
i mean , it's been four years since i've seen 'em , you know .
all these years , and you're still convinced ... you saw her father do that?
i know what i saw , mark .
fuck what the doctors try to get me to believe .
i need to know if she's ok .
you want to play?
sweet dreams , monkey boy .
what the hell was that for , man?
heh heh heh !
you're a fucking lunatic , you know that?
i know you are , but what am l?
are you sure you didn't see anyone?
no , dad , none of us did .
i already went over this with the police .
it's just ...
i don't know what i'd do without you .
you're all i have left .
dad , i'm not going anywhere .
i promise .
look at you .
you're exhausted .
lori .
we need to get you to bed !
i don't want to go to sleep , dad .
i just want to see my friends .
i don't think it's a good idea for you to go to school today .
you've just been through a very traumatic experience .
dad , please ...
i just need to get out of the house , ok?
i'll be fine .
i promise .
well , at least drink your juice .
will rollins and the davis boy ... escaped from westin hills last night .
oh , jesus .
it's all coming apart again .
don't worry .
we'll find them .
keep this thing contained .
lori !
oh , my god !
god , you guys , i'm so glad you're here .
blake's dead , too .
what?
yeah , he
he was stabbed to death late last night .
same with his dad .
what?
shit , shit !
this is bullshit !
the police are blaming everything on blake ...
iike its some kind of columbine thing or something .
they're saying he went crazy .
killed trey , killed his dad , and then took his own life?
this is so fucking messed up .
this is messed up .
excuse me .
sorry .
lori?
what is it , linderman?
um , well , i heard what happened , and i just wanted to express how , um ... well , to tell you how sorry i was .
thank you .
that's sweet .
right .
actually if you need anybody to talk to or maybe
whoa , linderman , let me give you a tip .
place your hormones back in the box ... and quit while you're ahead , ok?
we don't have time for date a dork right now .
thanks .
right .
sorry .
i swear , every day it's the same thing .
he's like one of those fucking froufrou dogs ... that keeps humping your leg .
give a couple to some ladies .
thanks , man .
i see what you're saying , gibb ... but that's exactly why you should go .
i mean , be amongst friends , where it's safe .
there's gonna be a whole lot of loving there for you ... and my boy trey , all right?
yeah .
yeah , you're right .
i should go .
i could use a few dozen drinks .
that a girl .
let your freak flag fly .
see you there .
you want to go?
no , i don't think so .
i i didn't get much sleep last night ... and when i did sleep ...
i had the most terrible nightmares .
lori , you had to sleep at a police station .
i'd have nightmares , too .
no , no , no , it wasn't like that .
i mean , this was really real .
i mean , there was this man ... but he more like a monster really ... and they kept calling him freddy ...
and he was so real .
shh !
what did he look like?
he he had this ... dark brown hat , and ... his skin was terribly burnt ... and on this right hand he had this like these ... razor fingers , and
you must be tripping .
no , no , no !
and then there were these little girls ...
it's ok .
it was a bad dream .
they were singing like this this song like
one , two , freddy's coming for you .
you know why they sing that?
because that's when he comes for you ... in your dreams .
you're lucky to be alive .
who is he?
he's a child murderer ... that some parents from around here burned alive ... but then he came back .
back for revenge in our nightmares .
funny no one ever told us about him , huh?
ok , thank you !
no !
you want some free advice?
coffee .
make friends with it .
mark !
that's enough .
you're scaring her .
will?
hey .
i thought you might be in trouble , so we
lori !
oh , my god !
lori , honey , wake up !
someone get help , please !
someone get some help , please !
the principal !
will , let's go , let's go !
please , somebody help her .
lori?
how much longer is it gonna take?
is she ok or what?
shh !
tsk !
for nose jobs , what kind of anesthesia ... do the doctors use?
they put you all the way under , right?
got your nose !
strong work , man .
i came to make sure she's ok ... and you put her in the infirmary .
what were you thinking about ... telling her all that stuff , man?
i mean , we're not in group .
because i'm thinking for the first time in my life ... that maybe i'm not crazy ... that my brother wasn't crazy .
she had the same dream , will .
will rollins !
mark davis !
this doesn't make any sense .
there's nothing on krueger .
not his arrest , his death , not even a birth certificate .
whole sections of the records are gone .
look at all these blacked out obituaries .
january eighteenth .
that's the day my brother committed suicide .
why isn't that in here?
i don't know !
but i'm sure there's a good reason .
remember in group when they told us ... not to jump to conclusions?
listen to yourself .
you're holding onto that psychobabble bullshit ...
iike it's some kind of security blanket , man .
let it go .
they've covered him up , will .
they never told us about freddy ... because that's how they decided to beat him .
they treated him like he was a fucking disease ... and they locked up all the kids ... who had made contact with him ... so they wouldn't infect the others .
that's crazy .
is it?
how come we were never allowed ... to call any of our friends , man?
how come none of our friends ever called us?
we were in a fucking quarantine , man .
that's what westin hills was for .
well , even if all you're saying is true ... then why didn't freddy kill lori?
maybe he's not strong enough yet .
my brother said it's our fear that gives him his power .
yeah , well , you sure as hell ... spread enough fear today at school .
holy shit .
you're right .
they wanted to forget freddy so they wouldn't fear him .
what if i screwed up the town's plan?
fuck !
this fucker's gonna spread like the plague , man !
kids are gonna start falling asleep , it's gonna
let's leave , man .
let's leave right now .
no , i can't leave .
why not?
i gotta go talk to lori .
i gotta see if she's ok .
well , is she worth dying for?
because if you fall asleep , you ain't waking up .
if that's the case , how come you're not dead?
or any of the freaks at westin?
when's the last time you even had a nightmare?
i don't know .
i can't remember my dreams anymore .
look , just give me one night , ok?
just let me find lori , and then we're out of here .
i swear .
all right .
if your ass isn't back here by dawn , i'm gone .
we clear on that?
this baby's my brother's pride and joy , so be careful .
oh , shit .
linderman !
shack , i don't drink .
hi , lori .
didn't think i'd see you here .
can i get you something to drink?
smooth opening , but , you know , we're already taken care of .
what happened to your clothes?
oh , this .
i was playing a drinking game ... with some of the lower primates ... and i guess i'm penalized for my ability ... to read above a fourth grade level .
linderman , you know , i always pictured you ... as a straight up bedwetter .
you know what , kia?
i used to think you hated me ... because you thought i wasn't good enough for lori ... but that's not it .
you tear me down to make yourself feel better ... because you really hate yourself ... which is kind of pathetic when you actually ... stop and think about it , assuming , of course ... you can think with all that makeup ... weighing down your head .
the cops said blake committed suicide .
apparently , it was grief over trey .
no , man , that's bullshit .
i heard some guy krueger killed them both .
said his name to my parents , they almost shit themselves .
yeah , yeah , yeah , man , and i heard ... that freddy freak , he used to live here .
fucking gutted trey like a goddamn turkey , man .
like i heard his intestines and shit was on the floor
oh , shit .
i'm sorry .
oh , my god .
look who's here .
look who's here !
what are you looking at?
come on , come on , let's dance .
come on , linderman , let's go .
where have you been , will?
didn't you get my letters?
what letters?
they must've never even mailed them .
who?
the ... doctors at westin hills .
i've been in a psychiatric hospital .
mark was with me there .
some other kids , too .
i don't understand .
well , i saw on the news the other night ...
i mean , that kid that was killed at your house .
i mean , i needed to know that you were safe .
what happened?
i don't know .
i don't know .
nobody knows .
nobody saw what happened ... and the police have been acting really weird ...
iike they know something ... and i heard them mention some name .
some ...
freddy .
freddy krueger .
where was your dad?
out of town .
are you sure?
what is going on , will?
well , look , four years ago , i thought l
enough with this bullshit talk .
let's go shake our ass on the dance floor .
come on !
i'm dead one day ... and you're already out getting shit faced?
same old gibb !
trey , l i can't believe it .
come on , let's go .
babe , don't make me ask you twice , ok?
now !
trey?
no !
open the door !
please , the door
no !
no !
you're the one that killed trey !
oh , don't worry about my little errand boy .
the only to fear is fear himself !
no !
she's mine .
mine !
mine !
this everclear is kicking my ass .
this
check out this fucking guy .
well , hey , jethro !
this is a rave , not a halloween party .
why don't you go find yourself a pig to fuck?
yeah !
invite only , cornpoke , and you weren't invite
son of a bitch .
yeah !
burn , motherfucker !
no !
run , man , run !
freak !
you killed my brother !
gibb !
oh , my god !
oh , gibb !
no !
let's go !
let's go , come on !
was that him?
the guy you were talking about freddy krueger .
no , that wasn't the guy in my dream .
that was somebody else !
who cares about some fucking dream guy , ok?
that psycho in the hockey mask was real .
dude , that goalie was pissed about something .
we need to find the police .
no , no !
fuck the police !
just take me home , will .
gibb , l
i can't believe she ...
i know .
look , call me later , ok?
please .
just to check in .
bye , will .
be careful .
will , i'm gonna go inside now .
i think that's the last thing you should do right now .
oh , will , please .
after everything that's happened ...
i just want to go to
there's more to it than that .
look , i tried to tell you this earlier .
the reason i was sent to westin ... is because i saw your dad kill your mom .
will , my mom died in a car accident .
no , that's what he wanted you to believe ... but i was there , lori .
i was sneaking up to your room , like i used to do .
only you weren't there .
i saw him kill her .
dad !
get out of the van .
get out of the van !
where were you?
what are you doing?
i've been looking all over for you !
get away from her !
you're in a helluva lot of trouble , you know that?
like i give a shit anymore .
get in the house !
you !
i'm taking you back to westin .
no !
no way !
you can't trust him , lori .
whatever you do , don't go home with him !
no , listen to me !
he was the one who had me committed !
you didn't understand .
you still don't .
you were confused !
stop it !
both of you , stop it !
damn it , will !
i am not gonna let you ... endanger my daughter again !
not after everything that's happened !
stop it !
stop it !
fuck !
lori !
i l
did mom die in a car accident?
yes .
of course she did .
prove it .
show me a death certificate .
show me an autopsy report .
lori , i don't think now is the right time
really , dad?
because i think it's a perfect time !
why didn't you tell me about westin hills?
do you work there?
because i thought you were a fucking general practitioner !
yes , i ...
i do some consulting there now , but ... it's it isn't what you think .
oh , my god .
so you knew about will this whole time .
lori , listen to me .
you're upset .
we both are .
now i think what you need now ... more than anything is to get some rest .
why don't i give you some pills ... and that'll help you sleep ... and then we talk about it in the morning?
i don't want to sleep , dad !
i want to know why you've been lying to me !
we'll talk about it in the morning !
now do what i say !
lori !
lori !
open this door .
open this door !
go away !
damn it , lori !
let me in !
goddamn it !
it's ok , it's me .
it's me , shh !
shh !
you ok?
are you ok?
it's me , all right?
i don't know how your father's connected to all this ... but i think mark was right .
there's some kind of cover up going on here with krueger .
we can't trust the police .
we can't trust any of the adults .
so what do we do?
we gotta get to mark .
he's the expert in all of this .
he'll know what's going on .
you always looked out for me , bro .
hey , mark .
i gotta stay awake .
shit !
hey , mark .
you didn't forget about me , did you?
oh , god .
oh , that's right !
everyone forgot !
that's why they weren't afraid anymore !
that's why i needed jason to kill for me ... to get them to remember .
but now he just won't stop , that hockey puck !
this isn't ... real .
somebody , please , wake me up !
please !
mark !
mark , wake up !
i need you to send a little message for me .
that's all , just a little message .
i'm not gonna do it .
i won't do it !
no? !
i won't do it .
i'll have to pass that message myself , won't l?
oh , my god !
let go of me !
help ... me .
mark !
pass on a little message for me , will ya?
sheriff , i've been compiling info ... based on eyewitness reports of the hockey mask killer .
we already know who did this .
sheriff , we closed down the school ... and set up a curfew for anyone under eighteen .
good .
now i want twenty four hour roadblocks set up .
nobody leaves town , nobody gets in .
we're gonna contain this son of a bitch ... before he spreads any further .
yes , sir .
sir , shouldn't we have the f. b. i. come in and
no outsiders , stubbs .
we can handle this .
we've stopped him before .
ok , i'm a little lost here .
stopped who before?
we don't say his name out loud .
you're not from around here .
i don't expect you to understand .
with all due respect , sheriff ...
i think we have a copycat of the old jason voorhees ...
crystal lake killer on our hands
you listen to me .
we do things around here a certain way for a reason ... and that's given us four years of peace .
so you either do your job and keep your mouth shut ... or , so help me god , i will lock you up !
do you understand me? !
yes , sir .
why don't we all just leave?
no , even if we leave , freddy can still get us .
we all know about him .
we're all afraid of him .
it was our fear that gave him his power .
we're marked now .
man , screw that clown .
i mean , what kind of a pussy ... comes after you in your dreams anyway?
now , that big ass mother fucker back at the cornfield ... all right , that's who we should be afraid of .
tell me who the fuck that was .
his name was jason voorhees .
shit , man ... um ...
how'd you know we were here?
nothing personal , but the scooby van out back ... wasn't exactly subtle .
and never keep your keys in the door .
great , so now we're completely fucked .
no , you're not .
i'm here to help you .
now , this jason voorhees supposedly drowned ... at camp crystal lake back in 1957 ... when he was eleven years old .
the counselors weren't watching him ... then they made the mistake of killing his mother .
the legend has it ... that jason kept returning from his grave ... to punish whoever returned to the camp .
i think we're dealing with a copycat here .
no .
no .
no , no , no .
he's not a copycat .
i've seen what he can do .
he's the real jason .
that's impossible , linderman .
jason is dead .
you'd better start thinking outside your little box , dude ...
'cause somebody's definitely breaking ... the fucking reality rules , ok?
it makes sense in a way .
i mean , what if freddy brought jason back ... because he was too weak to go after us on his own ... so he used jason .
i mean , he knew that we'd think it was him ... that we'd spread the fear again .
and now that it's working ... it's like he can't shut jason back down .
wait a minute .
freddy died by fire , jason by water .
how can we use that?
i think we should concentrate on jason first .
but i thought we decided ... that freddy was the one pulling the strings .
shouldn't we go after him first?
i don't know , maybe what we need to do is ... to offer freddy a sacrifice .
yeah , yeah , totally .
like a virgin , right?
someone pure .
dude , don't look at me .
even if you pay for it , it still counts .
oh , come on .
look , we all know who the real virgin is here .
kia !
oh , come on , lori .
i know you never made it with will .
why would he want to when he can fuck somebody like me?
let's tie the bitch up .
what?
don't worry , angel .
you've still got me .
come on , give daddy a kiss .
your eyes say no no ... but my mouth says yes yes .
lori , are you all right?
you fell asleep .
oh , shit !
i pulled that out of my dream .
how is that possible?
anything is possible now !
god , you just don't get it !
oh , god , y'all , two killers?
we're not safe awake or asleep .
it's not the sleep that's killing us ... it's our dreams .
at westin , mark and i never had dreams .
were you on any drugs?
yeah , but there's something called hypnocil .
they never told us what it was for ... but everyone there was taking it .
experimental drug ... not even approved yet by the f. d. a.
oh , shit .
used for ... suppression of dreams .
we need those pills , enough for all of us .
can you get us back to westin hills?
all right , this isn't it , guys .
come on , let's go .
hey , dude .
let's take a little j break , huh?

these are the ones who wouldn't stop dreaming .
are they dead?
they're in a coma .
it says they were given too much hypnocil .
who would do this to people?
your dad's name is at the bottom ... of both of these charts .
cool ... yeah .
what the fuck?
nice .
oh , yeah .
hold up , man .

best case scenario : .
jason wins .
he'll already be home , back where he belongs .
