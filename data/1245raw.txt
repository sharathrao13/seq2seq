what he's trying to say , reuben , is that we didn't plan it .
<i>reuben , itjust</ i> ... <i>it happened . </ i>
it's like the story of the hippo .

the hippopotamus , he is not born going , " cool bean , i am a hippo .

so i'm going on a date with polly .
all right !
where are you taking her?
i don't know .
some restaurant in the east village .
she left the address on my machine .
how could you let polly pick the restaurant?
well , i had no choice .
she called me , like , seven times ... to confirm and then cancel and then confirm again .
why?
what's wrong with letting her pick the place?
you've got irritable bowel syndrome , dude .
if she chose an ethnic restaurant , you're gonna be running to the bathroom every five seconds .
oh , my god .
you're right .
thank you .
you know , i doubt it'll get this far , but if she turns out to be easier than i thought , there's something you need to know .
i'm not a virgin , sandy .
no , not technically , but times have changed since you were last single .
now , listen , when i'm making out with a girl for the first time ,
i like to give her a little spankin '.
what?
<i>nothing violent . </ i>
you just tap her real light right on the tushy and say ,
hey , i'm your daddy .
i'm your daddy .
<i>listen to me . </ i>
<i>what are you doing? </ i>
i'm blotting the grease .
that's the best part .
let me see that .
listen , don't be shy .
it's just a little tap .
it's like saying , " boop , i'm your daddy .
i'm not gonna tap her .
brings 'em right back to childhood .
trust me , they're putty in your hands after that .
i gotta tell you , i'm really excited about this .
really .
i feel like this could be one of those ... defining moments of my life or something , you know?
yeah , i actually think it's not gonna work out , but i'm pulling for you , reub .
just pray to god she doesn't go ethnic .
the place didn't sound ethnic .
<i>what was the name? </ i>

two weeks ago .

what is that?
irritable bowel syndrome .
<i>what? </ i>

i assess risk for a living , so i know that i have a . 013 % chance ... of being hit by a car on my way home , or a one in 46, 000 chance of falling through a subway grate .
really?
so i try to manage that risk by avoiding danger ... and having a plan and knowing what my next move is , and i guess you don't exactly live your life that way .
no , i do it ...
i do it a little differently .
yeah , which is great .
but i'm not gonna ever be a dirty dancer , and i don't eat food with my hands , and i really like you , but i just don't think this is gonna work out .

<i>l i was for a few weeks . </ i>
<i>but then all he ever talked about</ i> <i>was scuba diving . </ i>
really?
i missed you .
<i>reuben</ i> ...
i missed you too , but ...
i mean , come on !
what was i supposed to do?
i moved on .
i'm in a relationship .
what , with that polly person?
yeah .
she doesn't even call herself your girlfriend .
she ...
that's ...
no .
she just doesn't like the phrasing .
<i>oh , okay .
okay . </ i>
<i>then let mejust ask you this . </ i>
are you really gonna spend the rest of your life with her?
i don't know , lisa .
because i'm ready to do that with you , reuben .
i made a mistake and i took you for granted , but i promise you that i will never , ever hurt you again .
i love you , reuben .
you know what?
i think , um ...
i think you should , um , go stay with your parents , okay ,
'cause i gotta be out of here in a week .
<i>what are you talking about? </ i>
<i>where are you going? </ i>
where am i going?
i'm going into the house , remember?
the house that i bought for us to live in .
well , then , let's let's do it together .
let's go move into our house .
you don't just ...
no , we can't just go ...
i can't ...
no .
i can't ...
i don't even know what to say right now , okay?
so ...
okay .
if you wanna get back together with her , just let me know .
no , i'm not planning on getting back together with her .
i wouldn't be seeing you if i was planning ...
it's cool , you know?
you guys are married .
she came back .
all right , polly ...
how's it coming with herb lazare , d. d. s.?
hello?
i haven't even gotten into it yet .
i'm i'm still working on van lew .
wait a minute .
i thought you decided on van lew two weeks ago .
we're presenting to aflac on wednesday .
polly , can you hang on a second?
just hang on one second .
no , i kinda have to go .
you better not be bonus hunting on me , reuben .
<i>bonus hunting? </ i>
stan , the man's career is on the line .
i owe it to him to give him a thorough analysis .
all right .
i'm going to barbados with my mistress for the weekend .
i want this van lew thing settled by the time i get back .
all right?
i am on it , and i'm gonna make it happen .
good things .
good things .
polly?
oh , damn !
<i>[ doorbell rings ] </ i>
hey , pal .
hey , larry .
lisa dropped this off for you .
oh .
thanks .
<i>[ reuben's voice ] </ i>
<i>i met a real estate agent</ i> <i>named lisa kramer ... </ i> <i>who showed me an apartment, </ i> <i>which i rentedjust so</ i> <i>she'd go out with me . </ i>
<i>[ lisa's voice ] </ i>
<i>i gave him a good price . </ i>
<i>yeah , not good enough . </ i>
<i>she's a killer . ! </ i>
<i>[ rock ] </ i>
<i>hey , hey , hey , hey</ i>
i just can't believe she came back .
<i>[ continues , indistinct ] </ i>
can we please just focus for a second?
i'm almost finished .
what's next?
polly's career prospects .
risky .
she's writing a children's book where kids get maimed .
yeah , see , i think her lack of career is actually a positive ,
'cause she'd have more time to spend with the kids .
<i>[ sandy ] </ i>
<i>you're skewing the numbers</ i> <i>in polly's favor , reuben . </ i>
<i>why are we even doing this? </ i>
because i'm confused , sandy .
i mean , my goddamn wife shows up on my doorstep ... wanting to get back together , polly's freaking out .
i just wanna make sure i'm making the right decision .
<i>i don't see how putting these two girls</ i> <i>in the riskmaster's gonna help you</ i> <i>make up your mind . </ i>
mmm .
<i>interesting . </ i>
<i>what's it say? </ i>
polly .
polly?
yeah .
no way .
you should just cut your losses and get back with lisa .
nah , i checked it , like , three times .
the program says she's the safer choice .
whatever .
<i>by the way , dude, </ i> <i>is your health okay? </ i>
i mean , you're looking kind of thin .
uh , no .
polly's been making me eat ethnic food , so i've been throwing up a lot lately .
cool .
polly prince .
polly feffer .
polly prince feffer .
come on .
you can't cancel .
i thought you were so excited to go .
i know , but ...
polly .
<i>we fell in love with these</ i> <i>funny little bolivian mud huts . </ i>
hello?
hold on .
so we had our designer use a similar color palette in here .
hi .
i'm sorry .
i'm on the phone .
would you just please keep it ...
shh .
so , also , you know what else?
<i>it's like i feel weird going away</ i> <i>for the weekend when</ i> <i>your wife's just come back into town . </ i>
i don't know why you're making this into such a big deal .
i told you i'm not getting back together with her .
okay .
so are you coming or not?
i'm coming .
all right .
okay?
bye .
okay , bye .
<i>goddamn right</ i> <i>it's a beautiful day</ i>
<i>uh huh , goddamn right</ i> <i>it's a beautiful day</ i>
<i>uh huh</ i>
<i>[ continues , indistinct ] </ i>
you're pretty good at it .
you're a natural .
<i>[ polly ] </ i>
<i>oh . !
this is amazing . ! </ i>
hey , leland !
are those storm clouds up ahead?
nah .
we might just get a light dusting , that's all .
nothing to write home about .
<i>[ thunderclap ] </ i>
are you sure you're all right?
<i>[ reuben ] </ i>
<i>oh , no , i'm okay . </ i>
<i>i don't think i have my sea legs yet . </ i>
<i>i'll be out in a sec . </ i>
<i>all right . </ i>
oh , god .
## [ fanfare ]
so i know we haven't been seeing each other that long , but i really feel like it's time we take things to the next level , and i'd like you to consider moving in with me .
why don't we just ...
why don't we just move in together?
oh , yeah .
we're gonna have ourselves a tussle .
<i>[ chittering ] </ i>
hey , polly !
<i>oh , my god . </ i>
<i>rodolfo's in your toiletry kit . ! </ i>
<i>did you know that? </ i>
did you pack him , or did you ... did you ...
what what is this?
i mean , why am i in your computer ... on your riskmaster thingy and ...
okay , you know what?
i can explain this , polly .
well , no , it's fascinating .
i learned a lot about myself .
i've learned that i have no career , i'm flaky , i like ethnic food .
polly , would you let me explain this?
uh huh .
lisa came back , and i , you know , i've been trying to figure things out .
what are you figuring out , reuben?
just about us and our future .
future?
what are you talking about?
what future?
reuben , come on !
this is a fling , you know?
come on .
what , did you think we were gonna get married?
whoa !
maybe ...
i was gonna ask you to move in with me first .
oh , my god .
you expect me to move to the suburbs with you?
reuben , are you insane?
whoa !
why is that so crazy?
people do that all the time .
they have kids , they they they make plans , they get married , they buy houses .
you know what , though?
that's you , reuben .
you do that , right?
that's what you do .
i don't live my life that way .
is your lack of a plan that different than my plan?
i don't ...
i don't have a plan .
yes , you do !
you're on the non plan plan .
i am not on a non plan plan !
you are too !
i've never met anybody more afraid of committing to anything .
i mean , you were a senior delegate at the model u. n. , polly .
what the hell happened to you?
whoa !
wahoo !
come on , you mother !
you can do better than that !
i've been living my life , okay?
<i>i've been in good relationships</ i> <i>and i've been in shitty ones, </ i> and i've moved a lot , and i've been happy and i've been sad , and i've been lonely , and that's what i've been doing , <i>which is a lot more than i can say</ i> <i>for some freak who thinks ... </ i> he's gonna get the ebola virus from a bowl of mixed nuts .
those nuts have pee on them !
it's common sense !
oh , trust me , that is so far beyond common sense , reuben .
<i>you don't understand</ i> <i>what i grew up with . </ i>
i had a mother who made me afraid of everything .
okay , well , big deal , reuben .
my dad had a whole second family .
what?
yeah , on long island .
<i>a wife and kids</ i> <i>and a golden retriever . </ i>
a second family?
whatever .
hey , you know what?
i'm , uh , glad i saw that .
polly ...
<i>i am . </ i>
<i>'cause you know what? </ i>
i'm gonna make this really , uh , easy for you , reuben .
i have , um ...
i have no interest ... <i>in getting married</ i> <i>and moving to the suburbs . </ i>
and , obviously , that's something that's really important to you .
so here's what i think your new plan should be .
i think you should get back together with lisa , <i>move into your house, </ i> <i>and move on with your life . </ i>
and and , uh , i think you guys will be really happy together .
oh , dear lord .
whoa !
<i>[ reuben ] </ i>
<i>you're not making myjob</ i> <i>any easier , leland . </ i>
<i>ah , come on , reub . </ i>
<i>weather report said sunny skies . </ i>
<i>your sorry eyes</ i>
<i>they cut through the bone</ i>
<i>they make it hard</ i>
<i>to leave you alone</ i>
<i>[ polly on answering machine ] </ i>

<i>leave me a message , or call back, </ i> <i>or not . </ i>

aah !
<i>[ wonsuk ] </ i>
<i>judas is biting me . ! </ i>
what just happened in there?
i am a professional , reuben , and i'm not gonna put my reputation on the line for a group of freaking amateurs .
<i>[ irving ] </ i>
<i>it's always the same story</ i> <i>with you , huh , pal? </ i>
you did this one movie a hundred years ago .
from then on , you thought you were better than everybody else .
why don't you let go?
move on with your life .
it's not about what happened in the past ... or what you think might happen in the future .
it's about the ride , for christ's sake .
there's no point going through all this crap ... if you're not gonna enjoy the ride .
and you know what?
when you least expect it , <i>something great might come along</ i> ... <i>something better</ i> <i>than you even planned for . </ i>
you were funny as hell playing those bagpipes , though .
did i ever tell you that?
l i don't think i've ever heard you speak before , mr. feffer .
<i>so , reuby , we're gonna grab a bite</ i> <i>after your work thingamajigy? </ i>
no , lisa .
i shouldn't have asked you to come down here .
i'm not getting back together with you .
what are you talking about?
w why?
<i>why? </ i>
you screwed a scuba diving instructor on our honeymoon .
<i>i mean , what kind</ i> <i>of cold , heartless bitch ... </ i> would do that to someone they love?
i'd have to be an idiot to get back together with you after that .
oh , and by the way , i destroyed all your little throw pillows .
yeah , because throw pillows suck , okay?
they serve no purpose .
they're purely decorative .
dude , that was incredible .
you're the one who told me i should get back together with her .
reuben .
whatever you do , don't ever take my advice again .
your dad totally put it in perspective for me .
i was barely famous back then , and i'm never gonna be famous again .
what about your <i>e . !
true hollywood story? </ i>
the e !
channel doesn't even know we're making this show .
what do you mean?
i hired dustin and vic myself .
<i>and i was gonna try and sell it</ i> <i>to the network when i'm done . </ i>
you mean you're doing an <i>e . !
true hollywood story</ i> on yourself?
sandy , that's so ...
that's the stupidest thing i've ever heard .
i know .
i'm such a loser .
look , i need you to do something for me that's really , really important .
so you gotta promise me just this one time you won't screw it up .
reuben , i'm your wingman .
whatever it is , i will not let you down .
your reuben's proxy?
what the hell does that mean?
now , he's dealing with a personal situation , so he asked me to fill in .
now , you gotta relax .
i'm a professional actor , and these dudes will never know the difference .
i can't freaking believe this is happening .
be quiet , 'cause i'm ... tryin 'to prepare .
i'm gonna vomit .
i am so sorry for the delay , folks , but one of our senior analysts , reuben feffer , had his spleen burst just a few moments ago , and ...
that's not good .
is he gonna be all right?
<i>well , god willing , leland . </ i>
but anyway , be that as it may , we have mr. feffer's associate here , mr. sanford lyle , <i>who's been briefed on the case</ i> <i>and will present reuben's recommendations . </ i>
thank you , stanley .
i just need a little bit of water .
as you know , this is a highly complex case .
um , let me see here .
yeah , on the plus side ,
leland's blood pressure is pretty solid .
and he's , uh , at a decent weight , and he looks pretty damn healthy , right?
<i>and he's a sexy guy , right? </ i>
and he is sexually active in the community .
polly?
j. f. k. , please .
<i>[ rodolfo chittering ] </ i>
let's not bullcrap each other .
<i>on paper , van lew is one of</ i> <i>the riskiest sons ofbitches alive . </ i>
<i>but , people, </ i> we cannot sum up a man's life with a bunch of numbers on a computer screen .
all right , we all need to look into our hearts and go ,
do i think this dude is gonna die in a few years or not?
is old leland here gonna fight off a man ... with the last name " reaper , " first name ... who goes by the last name " reaper , " first name " grim "?
<i>or will this base jumping, </ i> crocodile wrestling , shark diving , volcano luging , <i>bear fighting, </ i> <i>snake wrangling, </ i> <i>motocross racing bastard die? </ i>
<i>and the answer is no , friends, </ i> <i>which is why myself, </ i>
reuben feffer , stan ... <i>and all of us here</ i> <i>at indurby and friends ... </ i> <i>are willing to lay our asses</ i> <i>on the line ... </ i> and proudly recommend that leland van lew ... receive fifty million dollars in life and health ... and automobile insurance ... for a duration of no less than 20 years .
hey , what do you think , guys?
are you that kid from <i>crocodile tears? </ i>
you're goddamn right i am .
i thought so .
impressive presentation .
he's insured .
yeah !
bloody ripper !
congratulations .
<i>love ya , son . ! </ i>
<i>[ polly ] </ i>
<i>rodolfo , wait . ! </ i>
i'm so sorry !
<i>[ beeping intensifies ] </ i>
reuben , it's too late .
i have to be on a plane in , like , 45 minutes .
i don't think you really wanna leave here .
you have no idea what i want .
you left rodolfo behind .
does that mean anything to you?
look , i made a mistake , all right?
i should've never put you in the riskmaster .
truth is , no matter what happened on our honeymoon , you're much riskier than lisa could ever be .
yes .
right .
that's why it's not gonna work out between us .
reuben , you are a nice , safe , conventional guy .
just ...
it's not gonna work out .
i don't think that's who i really am .
it is , reuben .
that's okay .
what do i have to do to prove it to you?
huh?
hey !
huh?
what are you ...
oh , my god .
hey , look .
look , i'm eating nuts .
what the hell are you doing?
those nuts aren't even dirty .
hey .
oh !
since we've been together , i've felt more uncomfortable , out of place , embarrassed ... and just physically sick than i have in my entire life .
<i>but i couldn't have</ i> <i>gone through all that</ i> ...
i couldn't have thrown up 19 times in 48 days ... if i wasn't in love with you .
<i>maybe you were right . </ i>
<i>maybe this is just a fling . </ i>
but if you get on that plane and you go to cincinnati ... or tanzania or wherever you're going , we'll never know if it could've been something more .
oh , no .
no , no , no .
no .
oh , no .
n no .
oh , reuben .
please don't eat those .
<i>no , really . </ i>
oh , god .
i don't want you to go away , polly .
i'm not gonna marry you , reuben .
i don't wanna get married .
