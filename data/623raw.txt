hey !
ken ichi !
uncle !
you're safe !
that's great !
are you all right?
this?
it's nothing !
who's this?
her name's tima .
we escaped from that fire together .
tima , this is my uncle .
'uncle '...
atlas !
it ... was ... a ... trap !
we meet at last .
don't move !
no trouble .
give me the girl , and you might get back home alive .
don't make promises you won't keep , rock !
don't play games with me !
tima !
pick up the gun !
i'll have that back , please .
don't give it to him !
you going to shoot?
i'm human , you know .
rock !
so it's these people you've neglected your duties ... ... to go chasing after ...
tima !
it's you !
rock !
what's going on here? !
you told me no one survived the fire in dr laughton's lab !
and how did you know about tima?
answer me !
i will .
you are the one who must sit on the throne of power .
no robot must ever rule ... ... the ziggurat , and metropolis !
fool !
'robot '?
do you think you fool me?
you're out of line , boy !
get up !
i never want to see you again !
ken ichi !
so it was you who hired laughton !
what if i did?
i've come from japan to arrest laughton .
my name is shunsaku ban ...
get in .
and ken ichi?
you'll see him later .
i'm here to see superintendent notarlin .
he's been transferred .
his successor hasn't been named .
there's been a mistake .
the malduks have taken my nephew away ...
handle it through your embassy !
at this moment our state extends its reach to the stars !
i tremble at the honor of announcing ... ... the culmination of humanity's long history of intellect and science .
sak .
make it hot .
hot whisky or gin i can do , for a japanese detective .
hot whisky , then .
who gives a damn about the ziggurat? !
and those malduks can eat dogshit !
here .
hey !
that was rock !
i heard he quit the party .
what's he doing here?
thanks .
take care .
whoops !
um ... ... a man earlier tonight asked me to give you this .
i said 'no '.
he wanted it kept secret from duke red , and of course ... ... i said i couldn't possibly , but ... his name was 'ken ichi '.
'i can't move at the moment , so i can't ...
'... come to you .
'i'm leaving the country soon .
'i want to see you again . '
ken ichi !
what's going on here?
you will bring her back soon , won't you?
i'll be in real trouble if they ever find out .
don't worry .
this won't take long .
this wasn't my idea .
i have to get back .
you tricked me .
how else could i talk to you?
where's ken ichi?
if you know , take me to him .
well , well , well ...
to talk to you , you'd never guess you were a robot .
i guess father chose his mad scientist very well .
what are you talking about?
you being a robot .
that's not true .
i'm not a robot .
so what are you?
human?
so who's your father?
where is he?
my father ... ... is ken ichi .
the super being?
a mannequin like you? !
if you can't take me to ken ichi , i'm going .
tima's gone? !
watch where you're going !
let's see inside this super being father wants so much .
come on , laughton !
n n notebook ...
that notebook?
don't be alarmed .
i taught rock a lesson he won't forget .
where's ken ichi?
i'm looking for him , too .
i need your help for that .
you do?
i think they've got him somewhere in the ziggurat .
i need to look for him ... ... on the ziggurat's data network .
can you do that?
hold out your hand .
ken ichi !
well?
ken ichi's in ... ... that building !
you did it !
i knew he was there !
what happened to me?
i see ... you don't know who you are , do you .
what do you mean?
i'll report the instant we find anything , sir .
duke red?
yeah .
anything?
we can track the signal ... ... by where it burned out the splitters .
got it !
where?
zone 1 , south block 1 7 .
the hotel coconut .
tell me , please !
am i human , or am i ...
well , you're different ... ... from normal robots .
i'm human .
just like ken ichi !
uh , yes ... of course you are !
anyway , now we've got to rescue ken ichi .
tima !
i've been looking for you !
tell me what's going on , or i'll charge you with kidnapping !
i'm not your man .
it's your son you want to talk to .
huh?
rock?
i don't know what the plan is ... ... but i suspect dr laughton was involved in it somehow .
and i suspect you had him killed ... ... to keep her a secret .
take him away .
come on !
that is a special throne made especially for you .
one day from here you will rule the entire world !
me?
why?
that is your destiny .
i'll show you .
ken ichi !
ken ichi !
ken ichi !
wake up , ken ichi !
it's me !
can you hear me?
ken ichi ...
ken ichi?
what have you done to him? !
he's in no danger .
we just had to quiet him down a little .
ken ichi?
ken ichi?
i'll file a protest with my embassy !
it'll be an international incident !
oh?
i didn't realize you were so politically important .
my apologies .
but soon every nation in the world will bow down before tima .
make ken ichi the way he was .
what's one or two young kids , tima?
you have the power to rule the world !
what power is that?
am i human?
or am i one of those poor robots?
oh , don't be silly !
you're nothing like those piles of junk !
then am i human , like ken ichi?
what are you saying? !
you're no mere human being ... ... ruled by emotion and feeling , torn between morality and love !
you are the super being !
so then i am a ...
i've brought you new clothes , miss tima .
yes , you are a robot ... ... but you stand at the pinnacle of all existence !
no .
i have the emotions and love that you hate .
that's because your full capacities haven't yet taken form .
as your abilities evolve ... ... they're simply taking the form of emotion and love .
in time ...
you will become one with that throne , a computer weapon meant on conquest !
your memories and emotions will all be erased !
how did you know that? !
i fancy myself a detective .
come , miss tima .
you should change .
father ... open your eyes !
rock !
what on earth? !
what are you doing? !
it is you who must sit on that throne .
you are the leader we must bow to !
no !
tima !
you're awake?
i am a humanoid ... a machine made to destroy the world ...
not 'destroy '!
'make again '!
stop !
ken ichi ...
hey !
who threw that switch? !
it just started up !
cut the power !
it won't respond !
it's going into the red !
dr ponkotz !
what's that alarm? !
the omotanium generator's going wild !
what's going on !?
i'm not sure ...
stop , tima !
you'll destroy the ziggurat !
this comes of trifling with robots .
her memory's merging with the data network !
she'll go mad !
thus god destroyed the tower of babel ...
tima !
no !
she's no longer the tima you knew !
all right .
the omotanium generator will explode if we don't shut it down !
the chance of human survival ... ... will fall to 30 per cent within one hour .
my entire world wide network of forces ... ... will be completely activated within 30 minutes .
their targets are the world's major cities ... ... and 7, 586 other facilities .
1 7 hours , 27 minutes .
hear that , duke red?
your super being says she doesn't need us !
tima !
come back !
ken ichi !
ken ichi !
ken ichi !
ken ichi !
tima !
tima !
tima !
doctor !
we've lost control of the underground power pl ...
what's happening? !
get out !
you robots are not supposed to be here !
tima !
it's me !
ken ichi !
it's ken ichi !
stop !
the likes of you ... ... will never kill ... ... my father !
rock !
tima !
tima !
tima !
grab my hand !
i'm ken ichi .
who are you?
'who are you . '
no , no , no ... you call yourself'i '.
ken ichi !
grab on !
i am ... who?
tima !!!

fifi?
