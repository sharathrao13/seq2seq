goddamn druggies !
i mean , i was never into that .
i can't understand how they do that .
but anyway , so he was traveling down i 5 ... ... and he was probably speeding .
he usually was .
he's going too fast , and then , all of a sudden ... ... after this big curve , you just couldn't find him .
i mean , he's just off on the road and everything ... ... and it was so dark , and so i heard ... ... that they followed the sound of his music .
from the radio .
it was playing so loud ... ... and he was just pacing back and forth and pacing back and forth , and ...
and he was just gushing with blood .
but he said he was okay ...
lady , got any more of these fuckers?
oh , yeah .
we got ...
they sell like crazy .
we always keep an extra case stashed under here .
now i gotta order another one .
i'm new .
if you could just hold on , i got to designate me a reorder .
what are you gonna do with all those?
lady , how much do i owe you?
$ 135 .
what do you need all those for?
well , i was thinking maybe i'd take a little trip to russia .
they don't sell them over there , and they got a little emergency going .
a lot of tired drivers , you know?
do their thing , you know?
so i thought i'd be a nice guy and just ...

but you've gotta speak to that pussy , son .
you know , really talk to it .
you make a vow to it .
now , no nation has ever been so ready ... ... to seize the power and the freedom of the pussy as our own ... ... and we must all care for that pussy .
today , we do more than just celebrate the pussy .
we re dedicate ourselves to the very idea of pussy .

i can't wait for him to get his ass out here .

where's she going?
she's going wherever you take her .
wherever i take her?
run this over to spider .
take her , please , wherever the fuck she wants to go .
what the fuck's going on around here?
nikki can't handle her shit .
she's been partying with the candy for 10 , 11 days .
and then the bitch crashes and starts freaking out .
she'll split for a day or two , then she'll come back .
she's just spun .
this is for you .
this is the hawaii .
so i gotta pop by spider's and drop this shit off .
you can either come with or i could take you somewhere , whatever is best .
it's that fucking bastard .
how can somebody be such a selfish , insensitive ... ... fucking motherfucking bastard?
he never cared about anything !
the only time he was nice to me was when i first met him .
when , of course , i've never done speed before .
and he was nice to taco to boot , okay?
fucking fuck face fucker .
it's nikki and ross .
hey , come on in .
come on .
got something for me?
yeah .
why did taco have to go to the vet?
so how is he doing?
i mean , he didn't die?
fuck , no !
come on , come on .
come on , man !
okay , spider , this is it .
he'll be all right , right?
right .
he'll be fine .
he's gonna be great .
he is .
here you go , all you .
all me?
i'm hoping ross brings me to the vet in the morning .
then everything's gonna be just perfect .
that's good .
good shit , huh?
goddamn !
looks like the peanut butter dank we used to get back in the day , man .
what's the real deal between you and nikki?
what's she doing with you?
so why are you with ross?
it's too hot .
because i have a car .
i've been helping her out with my car .
he brings me places .
special stuff i left behind .
helping her out , taking her around .
he wants to drive me around .
yesterday , the dog got sick .
it was fucked up .
the dog got sick , but we got that cleared up .
i've been going ride ...
going on rides with him and helping him out .
i just ...
oh , shit , cookie !
don't .
no , no , no .
don't do that .
don't smoke it like that .
it gives you alzheimer's , doesn't it?
give her a ride in my car , and i'm gonna run errands .
just came here to ...
right now i'm on my way to the bus stop ...
yeah , yeah , i understand , man .
i understand .
yeah .
amy .
i just thought maybe we could ...
really?
oh , come on .
you know i hate fucking hippies , man .
you know why i hate hippies?
because i was downtown ... ... and this kid just comes running out and gets hit by a bus , right?
and the bus just crushes him and crushes him ... ... and runs over him , and the kid's just squiggling on the ground .
amy .
and blood is coming out of his ears , and he's just laying there ... ... and then this hippie dyke chick comes out with crystal ... ... and she rubs it all over him .
i wish that i had more energy .
amy .
and the kid is just laying there , and he's choking on his own blood .
it's like , " come on , you dumb , stupid chick .
what are you doing with your crystals?
he needs a doctor .
i wish i could sleep forever , man .
i wish .
i wish .
you know , i've seen some crystals do some pretty trippy shit , man .
really?
i was out with one of my girlfriends once in vegas ...
amy .
and we were hanging out , and we picked this guy up .
i think he was a mexican .
i wish i was black .
and we both fucked him .
amy .
anyways ... ... she got crabs really bad .
and i was wearing this crystal around my neck all night long , and i never got them .
magic crystals .
amy .
no , nikki , nikki .
what happened was ... ... that your friend fucked him first , and the crabs jumped onto her bush ... ... before they got a chance to get onto yours .
that's what happened .
you got lucky you got sloppy seconds .
there's no such thing as magic crystal hippie crap bullshit .
ross?

amy .
amy .
i'll miss you .
i'll miss you .

then my mama said to me ...
i wish i could do that to you .
maybe she ...
maybe she should've .
