all talk , all the time .
bringing you sports and weather on the five .
church leaders blame the rise of hate crimes and racially motivated attacks ... ... on a militia like group calling themselves " the holnists .
one of the most radical and powerful of these groups ... ... claims as its founder , the famed motivational speaker nathan holn .
the last of the great cities died ... ... when my father was a child ... ... victims of yet another war .
he told of the plagues that followed ... ... and how the living hid themselves , scattered in tiny hamlets ... ... in hopes of surviving whatever new madness ... ... conspired to rob them of the little that remained .
in those days , he walked alone ... ... a solitary witness to the chaos that reigned .
the earth itself had fallen victim to the insanity .
he told stories of the 3 year winter ... ... and how the dirty snow never stopped falling .
he saw the ocean , barren , poisoned , near death .
and how they watched the sky for 16 long years ... ... praying for the great lungs to start working again .
he said it was as if the ocean had breathed a great sigh of relief .
many commuters are abandoning their vehicles .

open your mouth .
it's true we haven't done this for awhile but ... ... for god sakes , it's like riding a bicycle , bill .

all you got to do is stand there .
i'm the one with all the lines .

awful .
just awful .
they said , " fear not , macbeth ... ... till birnam wood ... ... comes to dunsinane .
i said ...
... till birnam wood comes to dunsinane !

we'll fight ... ... as if our last meal depended on it .
tomorrow ... .
and tomorrow ... .
tomorrow .
and the day after that .
out , brief candle !
life's but a walking shadow ... ... a poor player who struts ... ... and frets his hour upon a stage ... ... and is heard no more .
it's a tale told by ... .
idiot .
a moron ... ... full of sound and fury ... ... signifying ... ... nothing .
but blow , wind !
come , wrack !
at least we'll die ... ... with the harness off our back !
i want to talk to him .
the children have never seen shakespeare before .
they still haven't .
thank you .
you're very kind .
i'm clapping because you stink .
larry !
i don't think you know how it works .
when i was young , i tried to be an actor .
i was awful .
but now i won't die thinking i was the worst one .
larry , stop it !
that's all right .
how much did you pay to get in?
so bite me .
you were very good .
good enough to get something to eat?
yes , we have some soup .
holnists .
goddamn !
bastards hardly kill anyone lately .
we give them food and supplies .
all the towns do .
i'd just as soon not give them anything of mine , thanks .
what are you doing there?
what are you doing?
it's just a game , general bethlehem .
it's something they saw in a play .
no harm in it .
wait a minute !
a play?
show me .
it's all right , children .
show me .
arm yourselves .
no running from the witches .
shakespeare , is it?
i'm sorry i missed it .
we haven't nearly stocked the game that we thought we would .
really?
but you had time for a play?
i'm taking 3 conscripts ... ... from each town !
they will have the honor of serving in the holnist army ... ... until such time as i see fit !
3 men .
could you do that?
captain !
all men ... ... between 15 and 50 ... ... and of suitable ethnic foundation are required to show themselves now !
general .
no , but keep that .
acceptable .
sir?
acceptable , captain .
need some meat on you , but i like an impressionable mind .
acceptable .
mongoloid .
unacceptable .
i want pure blood .
someone ... .
someone ... .
don't wave .
people , look at me !
someone like ... .
like that man !
you don't understand .
you were required to show yourself .
i'm not with them .
i'm just passing through .
take the mule .
let's go !
move !
hi .
hi .
ten hut !
i want a line right here .
welcome , gentlemen , to your new life .
you have been born again as soldiers in the united army of nathan holn .
god rest his soul !
the strong have been sapped ... ... by the whimpering propaganda of the weak .
men ... ... strong men , have been denied their destiny .
you men have been saved from that fate .
redemption ... ... is within your grasp .
you .
what did you do before you were given this opportunity?
i had a shovel .
i digged holes .
you digged holes .
now you'll fill them .
hi .
and you?
me?
is there any question in anyone's mind that i was speaking to you?
yes , you .
i'm just a performer .
shakespeare .
stuff like that .
shakespeare?
he was a writer .
yes , i know .
i know who shakespeare was .
cry 'havoc ! '... ... and let slip ... ... the dogs of war .
me?
that is the question .
we few ... ... we happy few ... ... we band of brothers !
now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer ... ... by this sun of york .
no .
you're pretty good .
you're also a fighter .
i can see it in your eyes .
you are a dangerous man .
don't you agree?
no disrespect , sir , but you'd be better off letting me go .
a fighter is about the last thing that i am .
don't you think i should be the judge of that , soldier?
get up .
i said , get up !
you're right .
you're not a fighter .
but you will be .
i'm giving you a chance at a life ... ... that means something .
a life worth living .
i'm glad to see you .
we missed you .
i missed you .
kurt , how are you?
hungry .
what happened to your finger?
it got caught .
caught in what?
friedrich's teeth .
thanks .
did i win?
i tried to tell him .
say it again .
say what?
words you said in town .
about the wind blowing and the rest .
say it again .
blow , wind .
come , wrack .
at least we'll die with the harness off our back .
what's it mean?
live free or ... ... die .
i think .
you're going to watch a movie or you can sleep !
but tomorrow ... ... you run in uniform ... ... full packs ... ... 20 miles !
everybody makes it ... ... or nobody eats ... ... for the third day in a row !
everybody up .
you got meat tonight .
why don't you tell shakespeare what kind it is?
mule .
god awful animal .
sterile offspring of horse and donkey .
can you imagine that?
there's no room in the new world for a bastard like that .
any man last in line ain't hungry enough to eat .
you show up last ... ... you don't eat !
i'm going to die before i'm last in line again !
that's what they're hoping for .
shut up !
at least you're eating !
you serious?
good .
this is good !
you want this? !
this is what you want?
babies !
the hills are alive
with the sound of music
these were supposed to be the best years of my life .
halt .
the laws of eight , gentlemen .
that is the legacy handed down to us by nathan holn .
may he burn in hell .
these are the laws that we live by .
the 8 ... ... is our symbol .
each man will bear it with pride .
only then will you be part of the clan .
sit down , gentlemen .
you will obey orders without question .
i told you to sit .
there weren't enough chairs .
i didn't specify chairs .
you could've sat on the ground .
you disobeyed a direct order .
you broke ... ... law one .
punishment shall be swift .
mercy ... ... is for the weak .
terror ... ... will defeat reason .
your allegiance is to the clan .
justice can be dictated .
any clansmen may challenge for leadership of the clan .
does anyone wish to challenge me?
on your feet .
there's only one penalty .
death .
please !
i'm begging you !
you will get out of this army what you put into it .
work and you'll be fed .
fight and you'll be respected .
die and you'll be remembered .
you thinking of challenging for leadership?
no , sir .
i'm a follower ... ... not a leader .
you got a smart mouth ... ... shakespeare .
you see colonel getty always following the general?
he was the last man ever to challenge .
fight lasted 6 seconds ... ... but he didn't kill him .
cut off his tongue ... ... then he cut off his balls .
and old getty's been following him around like a dog ever since .
fall out !
the general don't see it ... ... but i say you've got some nigger in you .
they're yours?
yes , sir .
a solitary man , aren't you?
binoculars to watch life from a distance and shakespeare ... ... to read about it , instead of living it .
no offense , but you seem to have read shakespeare ... ... yourself .
if he wishes to rise above mere thuggery ... ... a military commander must be classically educated ... ... philosophy and history , even a sense of the dramatic .
what do you think that i did before the war?
do you think that i was in the army?
i sold copying machines .
i was a salesman ... ... with the talent to lead men , devise and execute a battle plan ... ... locked away inside .
if nathan holn hadn't come along , i'd still be selling copying machines .
can you imagine ... ... the wasted life?
can you imagine the magnitude of that?
but war ... ... war gives men like me a chance .
here .
the prize is often left unclaimed .
we must have the courage to grasp it ... ... for fortune always favors the bold .
he always inspires me .
i have a design for the future .
a master plan .
i will need able officers to help me carry it out .
you have the intelligence .
if your heart matches ... ... you will go far .
we'll talk more in weeks to come .
dismissed .
captain !
we'll be moving out tomorrow .
issue those binoculars to a scout .
and the book , sir?
burn it .
quit moving !
what happened?
what happened?
what'd he say?
nothing .
did he say anything about me?
no !
i'm getting out of here .
what are you talking about?
escaping .
what? !
you ever hear of st. rose?
it's on the coast .
it's a paradise .
we can't .
we could !
between the 3 of us we could .
no .
i can't .
i like it here .
i like being a part of something .
take a point !
some of the men shot a lion .
they crawled into the thicket .
one of you dogs earned a treat .
over there .
those men hunted a lion this morning .
must've been a goddamn zoo here before the war .
anyway , a third man went in after it .
we don't know if he's alive or dead .
i want a volunteer .
one of you is going in there after him .
i'll go .
i guess size ain't a measure of courage .
is it?
shakespeare .
i don't think so , captain !
come out alive , you get a lion steak !
maybe you'll find your st. rose over there .
what the hell are you waiting for , christmas?
why are you stopping?
i found him .
he got him .
let's go .
hurry up !
you still got a lion to bag !
you men get back in line !
there he is !
shoot him !
you , in the water .
come back without him ... ... and you and another man will die in his place .
go !
go !
i'll get him !
go !
don't .
just let me go .
i don't want to be a part of your army .
my army?
i like the sound of that .
i got him !
i'm sorry .
how come ... ... you wrecked it ... ... for me?
it's me or you .
what?
it doesn't have to be .
we can go together .
you and me .
good boy !
good boy .

get him .
that's it .
get him , damn it !
no harness on my back .
shakespeare !

i think i'm still on duty .
all you have to do is hold on .
it's been a long time .
something wrong?
how tall are you?
about six feet .
are you smart?
smarter than some , i guess .
why?
just wondering .
have you ever had the bad mumps?
never had the bad mumps .
no syphilis , nothing like that?
so as far as you know ... ... you have good semen?
is that a trick question?
no , it's not .
i'm only asking ... ... because i want you to make me pregnant .
all right ... ... that's it .
wait .
wait , please .
it's got to be the uniform .
this is my husband , michael .
he hasn't said no .
i haven't said anything yet .
we've been trying to have a baby for 3 years .
we cannot on account of michael .
he had the bad mumps when he was 12 .
so we need a body father .
we could ask a man here , but it may cause problems .
we've seen it happen .
things go okay until the woman shows , then it can be difficult .
but you'll only be around once in a while with the mail .
you're the postman .
what do you say , mister?
you'd do us a favor .
i'm going to think about it .
excuse me .
my mother would like to give you something .
he's right here , mom .
it's to my other daughter ... ... annie .
it doesn't say where .
we don't know where she is .

know what?
i have a feeling about you .
i know you'll do what's right .
i got to get out of here .
easy , boy .
it's right around the corner .
what is?
what you're looking for .
what i'm looking for?
crazy old coot .
i knew you'd come here .
you did?
so how do you get to be a postman , anyhow?
you have to be in the right place at the right time .
how can i do it?
i thought you wanted to drive cars .
not anymore .
that's kid's stuff .
this is real .
so where's the right place?
could be anywhere , you know .
anytime .
only another postman can make you a postman .
kind of like vampires , right?
yeah , something like that .
you have to be sworn in , so ... .
the organization's kind of shaky right now .
it might not last .
what does?
you'd meet people who don't believe in you .
i'll set them straight .
it's a lonely job .
i've been lonely all my life .
so have i , ford .
so have i.
what the hell !
you repeat after me .
neither snow ... ... nor rain ... ... nor heat ... ... nor gloom of night ...
... stays these couriers ... ... from the swift completion of their appointed rounds .
okay , then .
no , i'm saying that .
you just listen .
i'm sorry .
by my authority you're now empowered to carry the mail .
congratulations .
you're a postman .
i'd die to get a letter through .
what did you say?
i said i'd die to get a letter through .
johnny !
why don't you run along .
i need to speak to this man .
i'll see you around .
sure thing , ford .
johnny is impressed with you .
whole town is impressed with you .
i take it you're not .
you're smarter than you look .
what can i do for you?
you can either clear out or i can throw you out .
either way suits me .
you don't understand .
i'm a government employee authorized by
you are not authorized by shit !
you were trying to sneak out of here .
you are nothing ... ... but a drifter who found a bag of mail .
i want you out of town .
all right .
this is going in my report .
these people don't need dreams , mr. postman .
they need something real .
they need help with the holnists .
are you going to bring them that?
didn't think so .
all you cost us so far is a few bowls of soup and maybe a few broken hearts .
i aim to keep it that way .
you can stay here till morning ... ... then i don't ever want to see you again .
benning .
portland .
boston "?
these people
just leave it .
i said , leave it .
st. rose "?
hello , abby .
you'll be leaving tomorrow?
i guess .
everybody's up late writing letters for you to take .
they're so excited .
and how about you?
do you have a letter?
i don't have anybody to write to .
i'll find you a pen pal .
someone with similar interests .
you know?
like dancing and ... ... checking for mumps .
you're funny .
hardly anybody's funny around here .
have you decided yet?
been thinking about it .
sure .
i mean ... ... why not?
god , you're so ... .
you're so ... ... beautiful .
i'm sorry , you probably want to keep things more clinical .
you don't even know my name .
i don't want to .
it would be easier for me ... ... if you closed your eyes .
we took a vote , mr. postman .
we want you to have this .
so you can't say no .
i'll take it .
you got a bedroll , some oats and a week's rations .
good .
thank you .
where will you go from here?
go?
west ... ... then i'll work my way ... ... back here , sort of a figure eight .
times seem hard right now .
but you got to believe things are getting better .
birds are migrating again .
the rains are back .
stuff's ... .
stuff's getting better .
o beautiful
for spacious skies
for amber waves of grain
shit !
you've got a hell of a nerve , whoever you are .
did you see abby around this morning?
this is as far as i go .
you're on your own .
god shed his grace on thee
hey !
with brotherhood
are you really who you say you are?
if i come back with some mail ... ... you'll know .
goddamn it !
what are you looking at?
everything .
they don't usually look at me .
who is responsible ... ... for that?
i said ... ...
who's responsible ... ... for that? !
holnists , johnny .
you got to stay
you got to stay out of sight .
i'm a postman !
and i'm not running from anybody !
stay out of this , or i will lock you up myself .
you'll be responsible .
now set that flag on fire .
throw it through the window of your post office .
do it , michael .
it's all right , michael .
throw it .
the united states ... ... doesn't exist !
that flag is an abomination !
there was the strangest little goat and it was behind a fence and it ... .
i looked at it and it had a color to it .
good .
everything .
i was amazed .
it was ... .
good lord !
that , gentlemen ... ... is a first rate piece of ass .
tell the sheriff to introduce me .
she doesn't belong in this mudhole .
excuse me .
you again !
that's my wife , general .
she's a married woman .
really?
do you know what system of government we have here?
we have what is known as a feudal system , like in the middle ages .
that's lords and vassals .
that's you and me .
now those lords ... ... they had some ideas .
they believed that if a vassal got married ... ... it was the lord's right ... ... his right ... ... to sleep with the bride on the wedding night .
me and abby have been married 3 years .
i'm sorry , but i wasn't invited to the wedding .
you've already done me one favor , son .
don't let this be a black mark on an otherwise perfect record .
abby .
we'll be civilized about this .
i want you to give me your blessing .
sir , i can't .
you can't?
you can't .
can't .
we had a great nation once .
know what made it great?
i can .
till the weak came along .
the " i can'ts " destroyed us !
i'm going to make us strong again .
i'm going to be the father ... ... of a new nation .
and do you know why ... ... it will be me?
because i can .
michael !
stop it !
you're killing him !
let me go !
please , let me go !
help him , somebody !
please !
you didn't have to !
didn't have to what?
you bastard !
you killed him !
your people seem seditious .
you seem seditious .
what am i seeing here?
i'm waiting !
a man came through with mail .
said he was a postman .
said that the government had been restored back east .
what government?
the united states government !
who said that?
which way did he go?
do not make me ask again .
east .
send a patrol east !
send 3 more ... ... north , south and west !
they'd better find him east .
take that damn shirt off , johnny !
i managed to save these .
do you want to die too?
i'm headed south with the mail .
don't be a fool .
what should i be?
rachel clark .
charlie sykes .
graham drewitt .
g. d. died of flu last winter .
that's all there is .
that's all there is , folks .
for now .
but there'll be more , lots more , once there's a real system in place .
right?
what about new york city?
did they survive the plague?
survive?
they got broadway up and running again .
there's a kid doing andrew floyd webber , you wouldn't believe .
how much is it to mail a letter?
mail ... .
they won't open the gates , sir .
what?
they say they got a representative of the restored united states in there .
they say this army is illegal .
and they say drop dead !
and go to hell !
that's what they say .
what are you doing? !
open the gates .
idiots !
what're you thinking? !
the romans ... ... had an expression ... ... they used to scare their children .
hannibal . .. ... ad portas !
hannibal ... ... is at the gates .
