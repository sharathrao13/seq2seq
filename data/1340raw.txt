adam's apples
adam?
sorry i'm late .
ivan fjeldsted .
call me lvan .
i'm a bit flustered but i've been looking forward to meeting you .
let's get going .
let me take your bag .
that was ...
come on .
people who have been in prison are often a bit protective of their stuff .
have you lived in the country before?
this is our small church .
just take a look at this .
this is our apple tree .
we're very proud of it .
there are lots of apples this year .
lots and lots .
it's probably because of the warm summer .
they're not ripe just yet .
don't eat that .
come with me .
good morning .
good morning .
adam will stay with us .
this is khalid and gunnar .
i won't talk to egghead .
there will be lots of time for that kind of talk .
come on , adam .
what does the o stand for?
in adam o. pedersen?
what's the story about the o?
your parents must have told you .
i forgot to ask .
that's a good answer .
it says here that you're a neo nazi .
are you really?
it's not the first thing that springs to mind by looking at you .
here it says you're evll .
it's rude to write that on a person's cv .
are you really evil?
i didn't think so .
tell you what , just forget about this
because there are no evil people .
we don't believe in that .
if you only look for evil then the world is evil .
but you can try to focus on the silver lining as we do here .
that makes everything easier .
in later years the devil has sent his troops to test us
but we have conquered them all .
all of us here have found god in some way .
you just met khalid and gunnar .
i saw that you did .
gunnar was paroled four years ago .
he was just to stay three months , but he chose to stay .
gunnar was what you would call an alcoholic .
he stole and raped girls but now he's on the wagon
and is studying theology .
he's not the only one .
there's also khalid .
he used to rob gas stations .
do you remember a young man being shot when he went to buy condoms?
no .
khalid is still not allowed at statoil .
a few hostage dramas later he's learning danish and is doing well .
tell me what i have to do .
i can't do that .
you have to discover that for yourself .
all i want is for you to set yourself a goal .
are you listening to me?
yes , i believe i am .
in any other situation i would say that you are rude
but let's not talk about that now .
what do you want your goal to be?
i would like to bake a cake .
bake a cake?
oh , an apple cake?
yes , an apple cake .
my goal is to bake a big apple cake .
with the apples from our garden?
yes , the apples from the garden .
that's a good idea .
i think we found your goal .
you're going to bake a cake .
you'll look after the tree until 1 st of august .
then you'll use them to bake an apple cake .
i just wanted to give you this .
it has both the old and the new testament .
it's a good thing to have .
sleep tight .
evil has many faces
and it can be difficult to tell them apart and choose sides .
especially these days where so many things are said in this and that town .
everything has so many nuances .
also we humans .
if the game of chess had undergone the same development as humans
the queen would be in front , the rooks would be crooked
and the pawn would be the main piece .
we no longer know who we are and this rootlessness ...
are we boring you , poul?
is the word of god boring to you?
are we boring you?
i need to go to the loo .
can't it wait?
not really .
we finish in 20 minutes .
i think that poul can wait that long .
let him go for sake of fuck and crap .
so we can song sing now .
okay , democracy has spoken .
go , poul .
go take a crap .
but you can't come back in .
that's okay .
you have to use the hospital loo because you can't use ours .
why not?
it's locked during the service .
why?
for security reasons .
let's continue if it's okay with poul .
we'll sing 634 " you know my heart " .
there's fried pork .
it was a good sermon today .
at least it was shorter than usual .
too bad for old poul nordkap .
ivan is always on his case .
he leaves during the sermon .
it's not nice of him .
he always does that .
it's because he was in a concentration camp during the war .
he's become restless in his old age .
he's 86 .
it won't be any fun when that age comes .
don't worry about lvan .
he's okay .
just don't venture into an argument with him .
what the hell are you doing?
me?
my phone !
i thought you were sleeping .
and my wallet !
are you stealing my stuff?
have you gone insane?
i'm sorry .
piss off , fatso !
sleep tight .
piss off !
book of job
they're not moving .
they cheeky for sake of fuck !
fly home bird for sake of fuck !
what are we going to do?
there won't be any apples left for your cake .
let the paki monkey climb up and shoo them away .
i'm not talking to you .
i don't know anything about birds .
what do we do in a case like this?
you leave them alone , i think .
can't we let them eat the apples?
they're adam's apples for the cake .
for sake of fuck , he can't bake .
you don't know that .
if adam wants to bake us a cake it's our job to support him .
he can't bake bread .
shut up !
i can tell .
what the fuck do you know , paki?
that's the right attitude .
that kind of attitude will get us some cake .
there's more of them coming .
that's just plain rude .
that's good .
very authentic .
no bird will come back now .
reverend fjeldsted?
yes?
call me lvan .
i'm sarah svendsen .
hi .
this is my assistant adam .
i'm not from around here .
i wanted to come to the service but i couldn't .
don't apologise .
you only cheat yourself .
what's this?
you're in a bad way .
let's go inside and talk .
i met this guy .
the milk has gone bad .
fine .
i was thinking about her .
me too .
no , you didn't .
are you saying i didn't?
are you?
let's take that discussion right now .
this may be the right time and place .
he came to canaan after having turned water into wine .
a boy was sick .
do to others as you want them to do to you .
don't call me inconsiderate .
it's okay .
i don't take milk .
maybe we have some cookies .
adam , could you go see if there's a few cookies for sarah and me?
maybe i shouldn't have come .
sure .
so you met a guy?
i have been in indonesia working for the world wide fund for nature .
i made love to a man and got pregnant .
i used to drink a lot before .
now i'm in aa and i've been sober for 341 days .
now they're saying that the baby may be handicapped .
i don't know where the dad is ...
just a second , sarah .
why do i get three cookies and sarah only two?
don't you find that odd?
there were five left .
hers looked bigger .
i don't think so .
have you measured the cookies?
he never does that .
let's stop this discussion .
you would like to get rid of it?
yes ...
no !
there's a 60 % chance that the baby is handicapped .
i have to decide within a week before it's too late .
i can't handle a handicapped child .
60 per cent is a lot , right?
it's just statistics .
let me tell you something .
when we were expecting our son we were told that he could be disabled .
we could have been intimidated by statistics and reason
but we chose to look at the bright side , and now ...
when i see him run around in the garden or doing his homework
we're happy that we chose to have him .
you won't find anyone to say otherwise .
the devil is testing us all the time .
we have to make the right choices .
if we all listened to reason the world would be a gloomy place to live .
you need to follow you heart and have the baby .
fuck !
good morning .
fuck , that hurt !
why the hell haven't you turned the cooker off?
this looks bad .
what did reverend fjeldsted say?
he's a frigging idiot .
he may be weird , but he's a good boy .
his life sure as shit hasn't been easy .
everything went wrong from the start .
his mother died giving birth to him .
he lived with his father and sister .
until they took him away .
ivan?
they took lvan away?
no , nobody took lvan away .
the father was taken away .
henning .
why?
he was fucking those kids black and blue .
they could hardly walk .
shut up and fix this .
pardon my forthrightness .
i've learned it's best to tell it like it is .
you're best served by being told the truth .
what's this i hear?
the cooker bit you?
gunnar forgot to turn it of .
take a seat .
i'd like to talk to you .
do you know why all this is happening?
why are all these birds in the tree?
and the cooker .
why did you burn yourself all of the sudden?
i think someone is trying to tell you that you shouldn't go near the cooker .
you can't bake a cake without a cooker .
i think satan is testing us .
by not letting me bake the cake?
he's trying to fight us .
he's testing your strength to withstand him .
he's always doing it to me .
look at your hand .
you're a complete moron .
nobody is doing anything .
gunnar just forgot to turn it off .
he always makes sure to turn it off .
that fat pig is hammered !
hey , fat and drunk !
so many accusations , but there may be an explanation .
you should know that he was the best danish tennis player in his youth .
he won all his matches but then a ball was mistakenly called to be out .
gunnar lost and everything went downhill .
what about khalid?
this was in his coat pocket .
what are you saying?
those two haven't changed .
you're a joke .
let's forbid people to wear hats .
it's a balaclava during summer .
khalid is from a hot climate .
here's fucking 17, 000 in cash .
you're reaching , adam .
khalid is saving to buy new clothes .
you didn't know .
give me my phone and my wallet or i'll smash your face in .
that's not fucking mine !
stay away from my stuff .
do you understand?
you're lucky that i'm going back in because i would beat you every day .
i'm going to the casualty room , will you pass the market?
i could .
could you get my cough syrup?
sure , what's it called?
von osten .
right .
think about what we can do about the birds , if you have time .
here you go .
it can't be traced but throw it away anyway .
can you shoot with that hand?
are you going to whack the priest?
he's fucked up .
he got it in the ass as a kid .
now he's all turn the other cheek .
but you're getting out in 11 weeks .
we're waiting for you .
espen can't control them .
i'm not going to shoot him .
i just want to understand .
i need to break him .
all that goodness shit .
does it involve the pear pie?
espen says you talk about a pie .
it's an apple cake , okay?
it doesn't matter .
i said that i would bake a cake and the idiot won't let up .
he says that the devil is testing us because birds are eating the apples .
do you need help?
who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
see you .
go on .
get them !
don't be afraid .
go on .
get them .
he's making them nervous .
they care fucking not about the cat .
all can see .
yes .
lambert is not working .
my granddad had a cherry tree .
it was attacked by birds , so he shot a few in the morning and evening .
shot them?
with a gun?
no , a waffle iron .
of course it was a gun .
what gun?
one like this .
you know what?
i think that we should try it .
can you take them from there?
can we guns use?
for sake of fuck , why you not said?
well ...
lambert?
lambert , are you okay?
what just happened?
he's dead .
it was a shit cat anyhow .
he shot my cat .
let's stop with the accusations .
it was an old cat .
he just happened to fall down while we were shooting .
if you want to discuss it now we can .
okay .
we talked about your grandfather .
do you know what i think?
i think it's going to be a good day .
it's too bad that khalid won't come in when we're making his favourite food .
he's embarrassed about lambert .
where did he get the gun?
is he a terrorist?
he wants to return to saudi arabia .
you should see his dream house .
it's really nice .
with a bit more statoil money he can go home .
why not just rob a bank khalid is very committed to politics .
he only robs multinational companies .
that's why he robs statoil .
statoil stole his father's land for the oil .
khalid is taking back his property .
statoil is norwegian .
no , i don't think so .
statoil is norwegian !
remember to tell khalid that .
so lvan knows what he's doing?
yes .
ivan just want him to be calm .
ivan is not exactly normal .
the anniversary of his wife's death is coming up .
he had a wife?
yes , linda .
she ate some pills and killed herself because they got a handicapped son .
he's got cerebral palsy .
he can't move at all .
she couldn't take that .
can i come in?
adam , there sure is no shortage of recipes for apple cake in this world .
it looks like we've won round one .
what a handsome man .
your father?
that's hitler .
no , hitler had a beard .
you're right .
i'm thinking of that russian guy .
i'll leave you to it .
hitler's enemies didn't take him seriously either .
don't you think that i do?
that's just plain rude .
old paul nordkap who's in the hospital with no will to live
he was a bigger nazi than anyone .
why do you think they ask me to cheer him up?
wasn't he in a camp?
sure .
he was working there .
he met goblins and all those folks .
goebbels?
he was probably also there .
come with me to visit .
then we can see who takes who seriously .
deal?
book of job
hello !
i'm glad that you could make it .
he's dying .
he won't last through the night .
i broke it to him gently .
well , let's give him a good sendoff .
how's the hand?
okay .
what about the honker , lvan?
it took quite a beating .
you don't have to waste money on perfume anymore , lvan .
you won't smell anything again .
yes .
come on , adam .
what's up with you , poul?
have you lost your appetite?
i've brought a guest for you .
hello .
adam pedersen .
are you feeling a bit low?
i'm scared .
relax .
what have you been up to?
have the nurses been nicer to you?
don't make them .
i don't deserve it .
they have been nagging poul because of this past but we put a stop to that .
didn't we , poul?
has miriam been nicer to you?
yes , she made me hot chocolate yesterday and tucked me in .
they are all so nice to me .
that's good .
don't be upset .
i don't deserve it .
let it be .
everybody deserves to be tucked in .
did she fluff your duvet and pillow?
yes .
there , there .
i apologise for trying to cheat .
i just don't like being inside the church .
that's all forgotten now .
i know that's what you always say .
i'm scared , lvan .
i dare not sleep .
i'm so afraid .
fiddlesticks !
you have nothing to worry about .
let's focus on the people who cares for you and all your lovely memories .
oh god !
poul , don't cry anymore .
don't be so hard on yourself .
all has been forgiven .
if you only knew what we did ...
all those poor people .
it can't be forgiven .
stop it .
nobody remembers anymore .
oh god !
stop your whinging .
it's not as bad as all that .
we all make mistakes but we don't let it bring us down .
you're crazy , man .
why do you say that?
why spoil the mood by being plain rude?
i'd be happy to discuss it , but this is not the place .
let's focus on the word of god .
god forgives all , poul .
god forgives all .
it's difficult .
even though you seen it before it's still difficult every time .
did you discuss your wife's death?
yes , i talked to lots .
a wife's suicide must be painful .
yes , that can't be nice .
linda didn't take her own life .
but she took pills?
yes , but it was an accident .
accident how?
christoffer had been playing with her pills and had put them in a candy dish .
linda always had a sweet tooth and she thought they were yellow m& ms.
your son christoffer?
so he's actually able to move?
why wouldn't he be?
i thought he was paralysed .
no , i wish .
there's no stopping him .
just yesterday he was playing rounders .
i don't believe you , lvan .
i just don't .
i've never heard anything that crazy .
has gunnar told tall stories and played fast and loose with the truth?
if it is that's just plain rude .
why don't you bring him tomorrow?
he's already coming .
he's been pestering me all week to come .
good .
then you can see for yourself .
good morning .
good morning .
christoffer , this is adam .
adam , christoffer .
maybe you could go say hello .
yum , eggs .
small mouthfuls .
he's paralysed .
what did you say?
i have to go in tower .
you two stay here .
i need shoot black bird .
sit down .
he's paralysed .
christoffer , go into daddy's office .
now !
this will not be pleasant to watch .
what did you say?
he's paralysed .
isn't he paralysed , lvan?
is he really , adam?
yes , he has cerebral palsy .
that is just crazy .
khalid , what do you have to say?
khalid?
him is it .
ivan , he's spastic paralysed .
your son's a spastic .
your wife killed herself .
your mother died giving birth to you .
your dad raped you .
look at me , lvan .
look at me .
you bleeding from an ear .
you bleeding from an ear , for sake of fuck !
the other way .
ivan was bleeding from an ear .
that has happened to me .
just drink milk .
plenty of milk .
just give up , lvan .
there's something you should know .
christoffer is recovering from a very nasty bout of the flu .
i'm the first to admit that he's been a bit sluggish lately .
shut the fuck up !
if he hurts you turn the other cheek .
god is on my side .
what is his problem?
he needs to be locked up !
i'm not one to gossip
but he's always been considered a phenomenon .
i don't know if you know?
how the hell should i know?
he's sick .
very sick .
i bloody well know that .
no , not like that .
well , he is that too
but he's terminally ill .
what's wrong with him?
cancer .
he has a brain tumour the size of a volleyball .
i've never seen anyone with such a large brain tumour .
i'll bash your face in if you call him a walking miracle .
have you heard about the ravashi syndrome?
ravashi was an indian footballer
who lost both his feet in a go kart accident in 1957 .
in a state of shock over the accident he ran home on the stumps of his legs .
his brain blocked the fact that he had no feet .
for two months he came to practice .
he kept his midfield position .
without feet?
they were a bad team .
they were maybe in the fifth league .
ivan has experienced so much hardship
that he needs to find an explanation in order to live with it .
that's why he thinks that the devil has it in for him .
ivan would say that everything is a test .
you're a test , his cancer is a test , his son's handicap is a test .
in lvan's mind he's locked in fierce battle with the devil himself .
ivan has no mind to lose and he blocks out everything like ravashi .
he's in denial about all the bad stuff .
death , mutilation , hardship , evil .
that simply doesn't exist in lvan's world .
why does he bleed from his ears?
we have asked ourselves that .
i think it's when something comes too close .
someone once got through to him .
he bled from his ears once before .
that was three years ago .
what happened?
you don't know his sister katinka .
a total slapper .
she fucked everybody .
i even fucked her when she was here to have her adenoids removed .
when she died lvan almost fell to pieces .
he bled from his ears and got sick .
what happened then?
you know lvan .
a few days later he was jolly as ever .
you could kill him by making him understand?
yes , in theory .
give up , adam .
god is on my side .
never forget that .
hi .
the cooker is broken .
i wanted to make christoffer a pizza .
let's fix it .
i don't know how .
we'll get by .
where did christoffer go?
he's in your office with a woman .
she's quite upset .
her name is sarah and she's a real hottie .
when she saw christoffer she started screaming .
she didn't want coffee .
well , we'd better ...
so nice of you to visit again .
has he been good?
tell me he isn't yours .
i can't because this is christoffer .
have you two been introduced?
how can you say the things you did?
say what kind of things?
you said that nothing was wrong with him .
that he could do math .
yes , he can .
even the complicated kind .
adam , maybe you should go get some of the cookies that sarah likes .
i'll come too .
is anyone hungry?
you can hook up the new cooker now .
we'll see if this one lasts a bit longer .
what are you doing?
playing with coins .
gunnar is good .
but you're pregnant .
it's a bit late for that .
we're rewriting an article .
about what?
the tigers in the orient .
here they write that there's only 400 left .
that's a sure way to make them extinct .
like last round at the pub .
what do you do then , gunnar?
you buy a pint an a chaser .
the fuck you do !
gunnar is right .
we have to do something .
shut up , man !
stay out of it .
yes , adam , stop disturbing us because we're busy .
five tigers is dying every day .
six !
six tigers a day , adam .
they can really jump high those tigers .
i'll come right out and say it .
you better come with me .
there's a new apple problem .
shall we say in five minutes by the tree?
i come and no understand .
i look fruit and see worm .
no , i actually discovered it , but i don't need any credit .
for sake of fuck , is on all fruit .
that's just plain rude .
yes , adam , it never stops .
let's do something about it .
take down the sick fruit and spray the rest .
gunnar , come with me .
we have to arrange poul's return to god .
book of job
poul bkel hermann , known to friend and foe as poul nordkap
lived a long and full life .
in his life poul learned that to know god you must dance with the devil .
if any poul nordkap surely did that .
poul learned that it's futile to fight good because
despite all the cruelty , screaming and tears he had caused in his youth
he realised in the end that this was just a mere moment .
the ocean heaved but it was a wasted effort .
the world continued and good prevailed as always .
that's why poul can return to god with peace of mind .
adam and i were by his side when he passed quietly away .
i'm not afraid .
i'm ready .
but this is not all about poul
because today christoffer turns nine .
before we gorge ourselves on cake
let's honour poul with a hymn .
kaj munk's number 634 .
you know my heart " .
there you are .
i thought you had gone to bed .
i'd like to talk to you .
can't it wait?
it has been a long day for christoffer with all this attention .
i'd like to talk to you now .
okay then .
go into dad's office and cuddle up under a blanket .
what's up with you?
is the business with the birthday cake?
what if the devil isn't testing you?
what do you mean?
what if it isn't him who's been dogging you?
i see .
you're reaching again .
if not the devil then who?
a little elf?
maybe all the birds , the cooker and the worms are just a coincidence?
is that what you're telling people?
god .
pardon?
god .
i don't understand .
what if god is on your case?
why would he do that?
because he hates you .
i've read this book .
book of job .
yes .
you've read it , right?
no .
it's about a crocodile .
that's what i've heard .
yes , it's about a crocodile , but it's also about much more .
remember god killed job's cattle?
his seven camels and his ten kids?
he takes everything away from him and makes him a leper .
does that remind you of anything?
i never had a camel .
look at me .
look at me , lvan !
you know that god is behind this , right?
god is not on your side , lvan .
yes , he is .
i don't believe any of this shit .
i just want you to know that it's god .
the devil hasn't wasted any time on you .
god wants to kill you .
you're just so dense that you don't get it .
why are you doing this to me?
because i'm evil .
you can't change that .
there fire in sky .
him lvan gone?
he forgot moron kid .
for sake of fuck , it was all fresh !
every night we now go to bed hungry .
he's done for .
you could use him as a crapper .
have you had coffee?
no .
is he going to ...
die?
you bet your ass he is .
why do you think that the bloke began bleeding from all orifices in his skull?
i give him four weeks , five tops .
from a medical point of view it doesn't matter .
he's come to his senses .
somehow you've managed to take away his faith .
that's why i want to buy you coffee .
it doesn't matter .
well excuse me .
are you ready?
get up , lvan , we need the room .
go with adam .
are you coming?
call me when he gets to weak .
we'll give him a room and a shot of morphine .
god hates us , christoffer .
he's always hated us .
it doesn't look too good .
gather the others .
well , the fact is ...
adam already knows but ...
i'm dying .
die how?
i'll sleep with the worms .
are you not going to stay?
no , that would be difficult .
what are we to do?
well , i hope that you ...
i don't know .
i don't know what you should do .
i don't know anything anymore .
if i said anything that you can use then do that or don't .
i don't care .
that's all .
where you're going?
i feel like a drink .
i've earned that .
gunnar ...
leave me alone .
you idiot !
gunnar , that's stupid .
you had a hair .
here's one more .
we have three .
ivan deserve good cake .
what the fuck are you doing?
i'm picking apples .
with a paki?
what happened?
lightning .
what's wrong with you?
are you fucking kidding us?
you climb trees with a nigger .
that ...
esben , just go home .
he say go away and take fat friend .
jrgen , let's teach our little black friend some manners .
what the fuck are you doing?
i feel stress .
he come with psycho knee .
he shot me .
here witness .
