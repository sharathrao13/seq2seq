we all start off in life with a dream , don't we?
for a tennis player , it's being in the final of the grand slam ... center court , a high lob , a smash .
game , set and match ... you're a champion .
you're number one .
but for most tennis players , that's all it ever is ... a dream .
the reality is another story ... my story .
you see that good looking fella?
no , not the kid in white .
the other , tired , good looking fella .
yeah .
him .
well , that's me .
british davis cup a long time ago .
two singles titles even longer ago .
presently ranked 119th in the world .
sport is cruel .
now , i know it doesn't sound too bad .
four million tennis players in the world , and i'm 119th .
but what that really means is this ... 118 guys out there are faster , stronger , better and younger .
and it gets you thinking .
you'll be 32 in ... the prime of my life .
how long can peter colt keep playing this game?
time to retire gracefully .
stop it .
stop it .
just serve .
these young guys ... where do they get the energy , the focus?
no fear .
you see , the one thing you can't have is fear .
and for the first time in my life , i'm afraid .
not oflosing .
i'm not even afraid of the kid .
i'm afraid of what happens if that ball keeps going by me .
what happens then?
i hope you don't mind , but i took the liberty of having it engraved .
wow .
exactly .
frankly , my biggest problem is parking .
right .
mm , not for you , of course .
no .
your own space .
nameplate again .
oh , good .
hello , lan .
is this the young man you were telling us about?
mm hmm .
peter colt , the one and only .
once ranked 15th in the world , i hear .
uh , 11 th , actually , for the better part of'96 .
yes .
peter's got himself a wild card at wimbledon .
then we're hoping he'll be hanging his racket here at the club .
well , we'll see .
we shall look forward to giving you a peek at our ground strokes .
won't we , ladies?
oh , do shut up , sylvia .
good luck at the championships , young man .
thank you very much .
yes .
carry on .
uh , peter .
peter .
watch the ladies .
occupational hazard .
of course .
oh , look at this .
look at this .
completely new hybrid .
yes , developed by the yanks .
firm but springy .
look , peter .
i can't wait forever .
there's no one else i'd rather ...
lan .
look no further .
you have your tennis director .
oh , that is splendid .
so splendid .
oh , look .
that's peter colt , the new pro .
once ranked 17 th in the world .
eleventh !
i was ranked 11 th in the world .
what makes one tennis player different from another?
it isn't a killer forehand or serve .
lots of people have those .
but the great ones have something else .
some say it's a supportive family .
others say it's being hungry , really hungry .
but as you can see , i've never been hungry .
hello .
and as far as a supportive family goes ...
mum?
dad?
anybody home?
hello , carl .
woman moaning ]
life still giving you trouble , is it?
deep throat . " director's cut .
absolute classic .
hey .
they've been at it like that ... like cats and dogs ... for weeks .
you all right , dad?
yes , yes , yes .
you got our wimbledon tickets sorted yet?
'cause , you know , i don't wanna miss your grand finale .
interesting bit of trivia actually .
i've never won a match at wimbledon with my family in attendance .
we're not invited?
no .
she's not gonna like that .
what won't i like?
hello , darling .
you're looking rather gaunt .
thank you .
why is dad so upset?
oh .
ridiculous man .
for some reason , he believes i'm having an affair with eliot larkin .
mother .
he saw you snogging in the club car park .
well , that would do it .
not in the kitchen .
i wanted your father to see us .
that was the point .
shake him out of his stupor , compel him to act .
i hear you're planning to retire to babysit a bunch of old ladies .
not what your father and i had in mind all those years ago cheering you on .
and do you know why?
because i believe you to be a truly great tennis player .
oh , god .
you've just always been afraid to admit it to yourself .
i'm not afraid .
i'm old .
oh , don't be absurd .
thirty one is not old .
it is in tennis years .
i might as well be your age .
thank you , dear .
and i'm tired of hotels , and i'm tired of airports ... and long distance love affairs that never go anywhere and ...
losing?
yeah , losing .
thanks , carl .
now tell her about the tickets .
tickets?
oh , god .
you really are a wanker , aren't you?
harsh but fair .
why doesn't he have the tickets?
i mean , do you know why?
what does he think?
does he think we're going to sit here watching it on television?
dad , what are you doing up there?
i should've moved up here years ago .
right .
well , i'm off up to wimbledon then .
righto .
peter .
yeah .
remember i always told you that tennis was a gentleman's game?
yeah .
total bollocks .
everything i ever told you ... total bollocks .
right then .
welcome to the dorchester , mr. colt .
thank you .
you have a suite , top floor .
wonderful view .
really , i think you might have made a ... [ talking on phone , indistinct ]
thank you .
wow .
well , they weren't wrong about the view .
you need something?
yeah , i ...
i'm so sorry .
i was given the key to room 1221 .
this is room 1221 ... my 1221 .
oh , right .
your 1221 .
well , that makes perfect sense .
what makes perfect sense?
you see , i'd reserved a more modest room .
now i'll go down to the front desk and ... thank them for this dreadful error .
good bye then .
yes , good bye .
and may i say good body ...
luck !
shit .
i meant ...
shit .
oh .
lovely kitchen .
this way .
see now?
that's much cozier .
yeah .
i get a lot of questions about my personal life .
i usually don't answer them .
that's why it's called a personal life .
right .
i mean , i just want to focus on my game , you know?
unfortunately ...
i have to agree with my dad on this one ... all that other stuff just gets in the way .
but , lizzie , you have had problems with chair umpires this year .
some of the players think you go out of your way to disrupt a match .
i really don't .
i mean , you know , maybe i go a little over the top sometimes , but , you know , maybe that's what i need to do to play my best .
and that's why i came to london ... to win wimbledon .
we'll be watching .
good luck .
gonna knock 'em dead this year , peter?
that's the idea , danny .
i've got a strong feeling .
thanks , danny .
gonna knock 'em dead this year , ivan?
i'll do my best for you .
i've got a strong feeling .
see you later .
hey , dieter .
you wanna go for dinner?
afraid not .
there's a chance i may get lucky tonight .
oh , really?
intriguing irish girl .
her father owns much of dublin .
excellent .
she have a sister?
only child .
tragic .
i should stay and work on my serve anyway .
this is my last hurrah .
i wanna go out in style .
well , that's the spirit , old man .
bugger .
oops .
sorry .
wrong court .
forgotten me already?
god , no .
you're the lady with the lovely ... kitchen .
uh huh .
lizzie bradbury , right?
and you're?
peter .
peter colt .
nice to meet you , peter peter colt .
five quid says you can't do it again .
mm hmm .
ten bucks says you can't hit two in a row .
you're on .
lovely form .
thank you .
hmm .
you're exceeding my expectations .
mine too .
do it with a slice serve , i'll treat you to fish and chips .
ooh .
the pressure's on .
lovely toss .
fish and chips it is then .
lizzie , sweetheart , what the heck are you doing?
oh , just one more serve , daddy .
you gotta be back in the hotel in 20 minutes for an interview .
two seconds , okay?
it's funny .
you don't seem the " daddy " type .
hit this one , and i'll sleep with you .
i'm so sorry !
too bad .
you could've used the workout .
hello , and welcome to day one of the championships , where the players meeting on center court today ... include andy roddick , serena williams ... and britain's best hope for a title , tom cavendish .
other brits in action include journeyman veteran peter colt .
and today marks the wimbledon debut of american lizzie bradbury .
we'll see if she can live up to her lively reputation .
what are you talking about?
the chalk flew up .
there's a mark right there .
the ball was out .
get on with it !
you know what , i'll let it go .
'cause you obviously can't see it , and i feel sorry for you .
30 15 .
quiet , please .
40 15 .
yes !
how are you doing?
what time's your match?
3 : 00 .
ajay bhatt .
you ever heard of him?
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
he's sitting over there .
look .
oh , my god .
shouldn't he be off discovering masturbation or something?
played him at bogota .
he's like all young men ... out to destroy us , to kill the father .
and like all young men , he must first be taught the lesson ofhumility .
exactly .
and you taught him that lesson in bogota?
sadly , no .
he killed the father ... straight sets .
watch out for his backhand .
twenty pound to win ...
ajay bhatt .
hold on .
hold on .
isn't he playing your brother?
you should be ashamed of yourself .
yeah , but , curiously , i'm not .
so this is it .
this is the end .
this is what it looks like .
1, 000 balls a day , 300 days a year , for 25 years .
six million balls .
and it all ends here , at 2 : 00 in the afternoon on court 17 ... while they're over on center court screaming for the latest russian teenage beauty .
well , let's see if i can at least make it last a little while .
ajay . !
come on , ajay . !
good luck , mr. colt .
thank you .
bhatt to serve .
first set .
right then .
play .
love 15 .
okay , nice .
not embarrassing .
another 71 like it , and you've got it in the bag .
oi . !
bloody rabbit . !
shoo . !
crowd cheering , announcer , indistinct ]
we have our first match point .
yes . !
come on .
i must say he's playing with newfound confidence today .
yes .
so here we are ... match point .
yes . !
come on . !
get it . !
yes . !
good shot . !
well done . !
come on . !
come on . !
yes . !
that's it . !
he's done it . !
he's done it . !
he's through round one !
not interested .
what?
not interested .
oh , suit yourself .
so you think that kid has a future .
yes , i do .
who beat ajay bhatt in his first ever grand slam?
what wimbledon is this for you , peter?
it's my 13th actually .
and since this may well be my last wimbledon press conference , um , i'd like to take the opportunity to announce my retirement from ... [ reporters shouting ]
jake . !
please .
come on , man . tennis .
that's my retirement from tennis ...
lizzie !
tomorrow morning , i want you at the rear entrance , 9 : 00 sharp .
we can avoid all of this , all right?
yeah , you're probably right .
excuse me , ladies , if you please .
come on , sweetheart .
hey , lizzie !
lizzie !
jake .
excuse me .
excuse me .
excuse me .
how's your injury?
female voice ]
you have one new message .
congratulations .
you still owe me fish and chips .
uh , say , 7 : 00?
room 1221 .
that's my 1221 .
oh , bollocks !
it's open .
... kuiper belt appears tonight in the northern sky .
once mistaken for a shooting star , the comet gained its name ... from two u. s. servicemen on patrol in the south pacific .
it's the first time in 67 years it's appeared ... and will be visible to the naked eye for the next two weeks .
hi .
hi .
uh , two fish and chips , as promised .
um ... [ chuckles ]
what?
let me just ...
oh , geez .
how embarrassing . get this .
are you hungry?
um , not quite .
i've got a question for you .
all right .
where do you come down on the whole " fooling around before a match " issue?
well , that's a very intriguing question .
'cause i think a little fooling around can be really good for your game .
you know , help you relax .
um , i'm not sure i've done enough research to have a definitive opinion .
that's very sad .
yes , it is , isn't it?
it is ... very sad .
don't get me wrong .
i'm ...
very interested in doing the necessary research .
are you?
i'm interested .
peter?
no one can know about this , okay?
really?
i had been planning a brief press statement .
seriously .
especially my dad .
he's convinced , if there's a guy around , my first serve gets mushy .
well , you can't win wimbledon with a mushy serve .
no .
so ... we'll keep it light .
okay?
absolutely fine with me .
we'll just keep it , you know , fun and ... relaxed .
relaxed .
good .
peter?
excellent .
more research .
and that's another point lost .
the truth is that dragomir ... seems to have completely seized control on this court , known as " the graveyard of champions .
for some reason , peter colt's game this afternoon ... has been less than inspired .
oh , god !
oh , god , i'm tired .
i'm so tired .
of course you are .
stay up all night doing research , you're bound to be .
game ...
dragomir .
what a pity .
dragomir leads five games to four in the fourth set and by two sets to one .
come on , peter .
hello !
do you mind?
bugger .
he was doing so well .
i wouldn't write him off just yet , pauline .
some young men , i find , have a stamina that's ... really quite deceptive .
the second round .
that's not so bad .
he did win the french open .
at least you got three games off him .
three games?
three lousy games?
last match of your career , and you got three games?
time .
it's pathetic .
come on , peter . !
well , at least there's no one here to see you lose .
come on , peter . !
oh , great .
come on , pete . !
love 15 .
who would have thought , 40 minutes ago , that we'd be in a fifth set?
but here , peter colt ... who hasn't beaten a top 10 player in the past two years , remember ... is at 5 4 , three points from winning the match .
30 love .
you were with me last match .
yes , sir .
brilliant play , sir .
do you think i could trouble you ...
sorry .
40 love .
and we have our first match point .
out !
game , set , match ...
colt .
incredibly , the english wild card , peter colt ,
has defeated the french open champion to advance to the third round .
6 4 , 4 6 , 2 6 , 7 5 , 6 4 .
i thought i'd done my last one of these .
so did we .
so did we .
yeah .
peter , did you know that dragomir is the first seeded player you've defeated in three years?
yes .
uh , two months and 14 days .
but who's really counting?
what , uh ...
what do you think of your next opponent?
truthfully , in all the excitement , i haven't even checked to see who it is .
it's your practice partner .
dieter prohl .
so two friends must now face each other as enemies .
an intriguing existential dilemma .
room 1221 , please .
right .
is your elbow playing up?
well , if i admit to that , you may use it to your advantage .
wow .
that's terrible .
is that what our friendship's come to?
dodgy shoulder maybe?
the truth is , most everything aches .
what doesn't , i can't feel at all .
tell me about it .
hello?
hello?
mm !
we should still practice together .
we must stick to the routine .
the hotel offered me a better room .
i told them i'm on a roll at the moment and i'm not changing rooms .
at such moments , our superstitions are all we have .
exactly .
even when i'm taking a shit , i must do it exactly the same .
i'd never thought of that .
that's genius .
you think of everything important ... you do it the same .
oh , wait a minute .
yeah .
oh , that's okay .
put me through .
lizzie , listen , don't say a word .
i was thinking a repeat of the other night ...
like fish and chips , early to bed .
sh ...
mr. bradbury , hello .
mr. bradbury?
damn .
yeah?
yeah .
peter .
billi .
come stai?
you are the dragomir slayer .
how are you?
you look a million ... lira .
oh , thank you , thank you .
i try .
do you know my partner , sophia?
no .
hi .
nice to meet you .
so?
i'm looking for lizzie bradbury .
have you seen her?
no .
maybe you should ask jake hammond .
oh , really?
why?
why do you think?
oh , right .
ah .
well , i'd better get a move on .
ciao .
good luck tomorrow .
thank you .
looking for someone?
yeah .
ye yes .
wouldn't happen to be my daughter?
yes , it would .
it's colt , right?
yes , but please call me peter .
lizzie's on a roll right now , and i don't want her to have any distractions .
right .
of course .
s sorry .
just to clarify .
do you see me as a distraction?
that's exactly how i see you .
so stop looking for her .
stop calling her .
stop coming around .
stop every damn thing that involves my daughter .
is that clear?
i suppose , in a few thousand years , the english will evolve webbed feet .
yes .
just about the same time the first german evolves a sense of humor .
no , no , no .
that's unfair .
many times , i make you laugh .
no .
i'm laughing at you , not with you .
ha ha .
somebody wants you .
oh , you know what?
i think i'll ...
i think you will too .
see?
now that was quite funny .
yeah , i know .
hey , get some rest tonight .
i don't wanna win too easily , what with you and that , what is it , bad knee?
i have a little confession to make .
oh , god .
when you , uh , walked into my room the other day ,
i knew exactly who you were .
you did?
mm hmm .
i saw you play tommy haas at the lipton last year .
oh , shit .
yeah .
you were ahead , but then you totally fell apart , remember?
yes .
i recall the ball girl couldn't get out of the way of my serve .
you gallantly carried her off the court .
i thought you were such a ... asshole .
to lose like that when you were playing so beautifully?
i couldn't get it out of my head .
i kept hoping i'd run into you .
until finally you walked into my hotel room .
like a knight in shining armor perhaps?
no .
trouble is , i'm the one that needs saving .
yesterday , i was losing , and then i saw you watching .
what?
perhaps my first serve's getting a little mushy .
mm hmm .
this year's love had better last heaven knows it's high time i've been waitin'on my own
too long
when you hold me like you do
oh .
hey , look .
there it is , the comet .
see , with the little tail behind it?
hardly anything , is it?
barely moving .
we have to wish on it .
did you wish on your next match?
it wouldn't work if i told you .
who do you play?
good friend of mine actually .
dieter prohl .
a friend?
then you should know how to beat him .
what are his weaknesses?
um , sausages , wagner , men in leather shorts .
in his game .
that's why i gave up having girlfriends in tennis .
you have to dig extra deep to kill your friends .
now i have to kill him?
without thinking twice .
and i don't envy you .
why's that?
you practice together , you travel together , you practically live together .
do you really have what it takes to close out a friend in the third round of wimbledon?
because that is killing him .
it's a bullet to the heart .
that's what's tough about this game .
there's a winner , and there's a loser .
and tomorrow , one of you is going to be a loser .
bloody pedals !
all right .
vij .
wh where the hell are the men's matches?
man , roddick lost tojake hammond in four sets , mate .
shit .
what about peter and prohl?
didn't hear?
no .
straight sets , man .
pete decimated him .
tore him to pieces , man .
shit !
oh , what , you bet against him again?
you know , that bastard usually comes through for me .
he's been on such a good losing streak .
here .
are you , uh , peter colt's brother?
possibly .
i've seen you in here watchin 'the matches .
yeah .
you could say tennis is my life .
my passion's chat rooms .
really?
hmm .
broadband .
of course .
you may have humiliated the kraut , but you're not done with him .
you change your routine not one iota .
i'm still your practice partner .
thanks , mate .
anyway , you know it was a hell of a lot closer than the score .
a let cord here or there , it would have been a different story .
bullshit .
you annihilated me .
you ...
you hit from the soul , the heart .
something's happened to you .
something else , something ...
the girl in the taxi .
the the end of the waving hand .
that's ...
that's where the fire comes from .
admit it .
dieter , listen .
do you think that , in the middle of a championship ... and for the first time in years i'm actually winning ,
i'd be dumb enough to get involved with a woman?
absolutely .
female voice ]
you have eight new messages .
well , aren't i popular?
peter . lan frazier from the club .
well done . !
take as long as you need before you start with us .
oh , and the , uh ... the ladies send their regards .
you were incredible today .
i have a free day tomorrow .
i'll call you later .
peter , remember me?
it's your mother .
i hear congratulations are in order .
what did i always say about ya?
i don't know .
remind me , ron .
so , uh , cucumber and cucumber?
and cucumber .
they forgot to put the sandwich in my sandwich .
what are you doing here , ron?
you're not still my agent , are you?
what are you talkin 'about?
what am i talking about?
okay , well , i called you about a year ago , and i'm still waiting for you to return my call .
yeah , i'm into e mails now .
i don't do the , uh , phone thing anymore .
ron?
that's a lie .
yeah , it's a lie .
you want me to be completely honest with you?
agents are not miracle workers .
we can't sell a product that doesn't exist .
but here you are existing again , so i'm back selling again .
you know what , ron?
i genuinely despise you .
and you know what , peter?
i really don't take it personally .
because this could all be over by monday .
cavendish is a serve and volley guy , and you've always played shit against them , so i'd like to capitalize now if that's not a problem with you .
i don't want you to go down in history ... as that english guy who beat his best friend , the german guy , only to get beat by the other english guy .
i'd like to put some money in your pocket .
you got a problem with that?
you'd have to cut your commission .
okay , look , unfortunately that's a no go area .
everybody pays 10 % .
say five percent , or the next offer's four .
you know , success has really changed you .
and i'm loving it .
screw it .
you got a deal .
besides , i have a funny feeling that cavendish is going down .
tea?
yes .
i'd love some .
now let's get down to business .
slazenger's having a cocktail party this evening , and everybody's dying to meet you for the very first time ... all over again .

i have a thing later .
i'll call you back .
i'll ring you tomorrow .

peter .
peter colt .
the " peter peter colt?
the one and only .
oh , i've heard a lot about you .
oh , really?
nothing good , i hope .
that you're a man who's not afraid to come to the net .
i hear that this is your first wimbledon , and you're gonna go all the way .
every chance i get .
well , well , well .
if this works out , do i get the , uh ...
you can have 10 % of our kids .
the kids .
that's a ... [ murmurs ]
are you all right?
you look beautiful .
thank you .
you come along and play matchmaker?
did i do that?
i'm sorry .
i just got excited by the math .
let's just have a drink .
we can talk over this whole nike thing , and you'll still have her home before she turns into a pumpkin .
one day , none of this will be ours .
oh , no .
asshole incoming .
4 : 00 .
lizzie , what's the deal?
i've left you , like , half a dozen messages .
oh , really?
how about that?
hi .
do you know peter colt?
yeah , we did meet once .
first round , san jose , last year .
exactly .
a memorable match .
yeah , which i , like , won .
peter's in the quarters .
did you hear?
wait a second .
are you screwing him?
you know what?
you are , aren't you?
i don't believe this .
listen , my friend , we don't want ...
whoa , whoa , whoa .
what are you , grandpa , ranked , like , 120?
i thought all those things they said about you were just rumors , but you really are a cheap little ...
oh !
jesus !
that really hurts .
but you did it so well .
are you all right , sir?
i'm fine .
i'm fine .
good night , jake .
hey , yes , don't get up .
leave me alone . !
i'm fine . !
that's the first time i've ever hit anybody in my whole life .
lizzie?
lizzie !
other side .
other ...
i've never had anyone fight for my honor before .
i kinda like it .
jesus christ !
you're not safe to be with .
wait till you see me drive .
so , these are the wild streets of my youth .
the drugs , the sex , the milk shakes .
my parents live here , and i still keep a flat .
oh , so we can stay there tonight .
yeah .
but what about your dad?
aw , let him find his own place .
parents are such a responsibility .
i know .
they're worse than children .
oh , definitely .
my parents got divorced when i was 13 .
my mom was always on the road trying to be a singer .
what went wrong?
she couldn't sing .
so mainly my dad brought me up .
mine are still together .
which proves that love's not just blind , it's bloody stupid .
it's sad .
everything they used to love in each other now seems to drive them crazy .
i can't imagine ever wanting to get married .
no .
no .
i mean , that's why we love the tour , isn't it?
there's always another country , another airport .
another girl .
that's right , leslie .
lizzie .
i meant lizzie .
ow , ow .
i meant ...
you said " leslie .
who's leslie?
as you can see , we've , uh , we've had to fire the builders due to creative differences .
and truthfully , peter's had a little bit of a liquidity problem .
oh , my nan liked to drink .
sherry .
right .
piccy?
just a bitty .
carl , what are you doing?
uh , pete .

i gotta go .
i'll ...
i'll see you at practice in the morning .
everything all right?
everything's great .
aren't we gonna have a workout?
i thought we just had one .

i usually do 10 miles .
why are you running behind me?
i'm just enjoying the view .
snip by snip i'm oozin'it bit by bit yeah i'm takin'it step by step boy , here and now we're caught in a moment and i won't let it go
and the silence it belongs to you and i
hey , look at that .
this is where my dad taught me to play tennis .
huh .
look at it now .
it's a shame .
yeah .
ace !
come on .
make a little effort .
ace !
what's the matter with you?
are you scared of a girl?
there's something i haven't told you .
what?
this is my last tournament , no matter what happens .
but you're doing so great .
hey , you just have to ...
keep winning .
right .
so keep winning .
oh , finally .
colt returns with a somewhat demure crosscourt forehand .
ah . !
colt makes a smashing return .
with unladylike effort ,
bradbury strains to get to the ball .
oh . !
it's an extremely high lob .
will he maintain his gentlemanly composure , or will he ... dare i say ... win the point?
hold on .
what's happened to the ball?
look .
gotta go .
good bye .
hundred quid on cavendish in the quarters .
hold your horses .
so , still bettin 'against your brother , are ya?
it's tactical .
if he loses , i get rich .
and if he wins , i get laid .
where the heck did you get a hundred quid anyway?
photojournalism .
i trust you slept well after your night of debauchery with young master .
i declare , i surely did .
good .
so did i. god .
no wonder the english never win wimbledon .
i'd love to see an english guy in the finals , but give me a break .
peter colt is the luckiest man in tennis .
oh .
wanker .
god , it's incredible how much that actually looks like your dad .
oh , shit .
incredible how much that building ...
shit !
shit !
quick . !
hide . !
oh , carl !
you bastard !
oh , hello .
mr. bradbury .
where's my daughter?
she ...
gone , sadly .
sadly , gone .
she had to go and work on that first serve .
i expect she meant to meet you at the practice courts .
are you bullshitting me?
absolutely not .
i'd never bullshit you .
i wouldn't dream of it .
so , how was your trip down?
the traffic can be murder getting out of london .
we left early .
well , the early bird does catch the worm .
uh , wou would you like a cup of , uh , tea?
maybe something stronger .
a shot of whiskey .
a shot at me .
it's peter , right?
yeah .
look , peter , i got nothing against you personally .
you seem like a nice guy , and , uh ...
oh , good .
i'm not an idiot .
i know that lizzie likes to ... have her fun .
and it keeps her relaxed .
um , if you were just another easy ...
you know .
well , that would be one thing .
but you're not , are you?
as a matter of fact , i was incredibly easy .
no , no .
this time , it's different .
she's ... falling for you .
oh , i see .
which is a total disaster .
but why?
she's hardly lost a set .
i ...
look , her footwork is off .
her serve is a mess .
she's gotta get her head back in the game .
she's gotta remember what it is that she wants .
and what do you think that is?
what we've been working towards all these years , what she's always wanted more than anything .
i still want it .
oh .
hi .
i want to win wimbledon .
i'm sorry .
that's all right , sweetheart .
well , we'd better get going .
we got a lot of work to do .
you're gonna go?
yeah .
he's right .
i'm sorry .
wait a second .
lizzie?
lizzie . !
lizzie , this is ridiculous .
you're a grown woman , and you should be making your own decisions .
this is my decision .
we can be together after the tournament .
after the tournament?
what does that mean?
you can't just switch me on and off like a bloody lightbulb .
i'll call you at the hotel .
she won't be at the hotel .
what?
i'm sorry , kid , but ...
if you're together , she can't play .
tom . !
tom . !
tom . !
well , this may be an all british affair , but tom cavendish is clearly in control of the crowd and the match today .
he's up a break in the first set , and peter colt ... with the expectations of an entire nation upon him ... seems to be withering under the pressure .
ladies and gentlemen , quiet please .
40 love .
so that's set point for tom cavendish .
linda , to the patio door .
well , talk to sergei .
she hits short , you come in .
daddy , stop bugging me .
she'll never pass you .
i'm focused .
i know the game plan .
yeah , right .
he's out of my head now .
it's over .
stop freaking out on me .
oh , yeah .
it was definitely his ankle .
you can see how he landed right on it .
this is ugly .
cavendish . !
cavendish . !
cavendish . !
peter colt may havejust got himself a free pass to the semis .
think you can go on?
not so fast , chrissy .
listen to the crowd .
they worship the kid here .
the question is , will colt be able to take advantage of tom cavendish?
he's never shown much of a killer instinct .
quiet , please .
40 love .
there's your answer , john .
look at that smile .
watch out , tom cavendish .
can we take another route?
her match is at 3 : 00 .
i doubt it .
it's a chocker .
what's the score , sweetheart?
it's match point .
game point .
he's done it . !
peter colt has done it again . !
another upset .
another seeded player goes down , and colt will now take on fifth seed pierre maroux in the semifinals on friday .
congratulations , my friend .
thank you , but i think my countrymen hate me .
what?
i've just destroyed their best hopes of winning a championship .
oh , ridiculous .
everyone loves a winner .
everybody but the british .
thank you .
see , i was right .
everything's good .
everybody loves you .
almost everybody .
30 all .
what do you think makes her so extraordinary?
no embarrassment , no fear .
she makes a decision , she goes for it , all pistons firing .
it's a turn on for the rest of us 'cause most of the time , let's face it , we're all scared shitless .
even you , ron?
me?
i hate making a decision .
like right now , i'm very , very afraid .
if you don't see that girl again , it's going to mess with your head , screw up your confidence .
on the other hand , i'm terrified ...
i'm petrified that if i tell you where that girl is camped out , her father's gonna fire my ass .
where's the girl camped out , ron?
32 kensington place .
first floor apartment .
i made a decision .
game ...
miss bradbury .
miss bradbury wins final set .
me too .
oh , shh .
shh .
no .
no .
hi .
shh .
now , listen .
it's not what you think , so don't start ...
i'll jump .
i'll jump .
i will .
you want that on you conscience?
thank you .
lizzie?
lizzie?
lizzie , it's me .
shit !
hey !
shut up !
noisy little shit .
oh ...
that hurt .
bugger !
peter .
yeah .
what are you doing here?
that's an excellent question .
that sad fact of the matter is , i can't seem to get through 24 hours without you .
i missed you , peter peter colt .
you have?
but i need you to go .
no , you need me to stay .
peter .
lizzie .
peter .
lizzie .
people have fallen in love before , you know .
oh .
is that what we're doing here?
good thing you didn't get the wrong room .
i did , but your dad's a very quick shag .
good morning . !
bbc london 94 . 9 .
the lark's on the wing and everything's for the best ... in this best of all possible worlds , 'cause it's semifinals day .
which means it can only get better as peter colt stares down the racket of pierre maroux .
game point .
whoa . !
peter colt must have had his wheaties this morning .
he's off to a roaring start .
but remember , chrissy , the last time these two met ... was in '97 u. s. open semis , a day i'm certain peter colt wants to wipe from the memory banks .
no kiddin '.
it was the greatest opportunity of colt's career .
he was up two sets , and then he completely choked .
and i don't think he's ever fully recovered from it .
you know , john , choking can be instigated by the smallest thing .
absolutely .
you wake up in the morning , and something just isn't right .
or maybe a little superstition you have goes wrong .
and a seed of self doubt is planted .
lizzie . !
i love you . !
then everywhere you look , that feeling of doubt seems to be looking right back at you .
once that happens , all it takes is one point .
one decisive point that can make or break your confidence ... and completely determine the outcome of a match .
game ...
miss rupesindhe .
advantage ...
colt .
well , there's no trophy here today on number two court .
peter colt is firmly in control .
thank you .
and incredibly , just two points away ... from the wimbledon final on sunday against america's jake hammond .
come on , pete . !
quiet please .
that was an almost impossible passing shot .
match point .
yes !
and he seems to be having trouble getting up from that awkward tumble just now .
peter colt's clearly in pain .
shit .
it's hard to tell .
this could spell disaster for the man who's captured the hearts ...
come on , son .
come on .
come on .
pick yourself up .
you can do it .
mr. colt , are you okay?
it's my back .
can you get up?
i'm not entirely sure .
one more point .
come on .
he can't actually hear you .
oh , yes , he can .
this is an eerie echo of the tom cavendish match .
well , he's back on his feet .
oh , yes , he can .
well , only he knows how much it's hurting him .
oh , my god !
the stress .
how does he deal with it?
how does who deal with it?
oh , my back !
my back is killing me .
but remember you're one point away from the finals .
i'd love to see an english guy in the finals , but give me a break .
do you remember australia?
your shoulder was killing you , and what did you do then?
all right .
all right .
all right !
peter colt is the luckiest man in tennis .
this is gonna hurt .
game , set , match ...
colt .
6 2 , 6 1 , 6 3 .
yes !
i knew he could do it .
who would have bet , two weeks ago , that the man time had forgotten , [ continues , indistinct ]
rabbit .
caught it messing with your lettuce .
good man .
congratulations , peter .
can we just do a quickie?
no , not right now .
how'd she do?
it's just one of those days where i couldn't do anything wrong , and lizzie just couldn't do anything right .
that would include accepting defeat , which ms. bradbury found very difficult today .
bugger .
it's not as if she can blame you , is it?
i told you i needed to focus , to be away from you for just a few days .
but , no , instead you sneak into my room , you don't even have the decency to spend the night ...
i had the earliest start , and i thought you'd want the extra sleep .
i was some chick you picked up .
well , this chick is going back home to work on her serve .
lizzie , i am sorry about your match .
i really am .
but please don't go .
because you need to screw me before the finals .
that's why you think i'm here?
it's not .
really , peter?
not even just a little bit?
aha . !
you see?
i know you want me to think ... that we're falling in love or some bullshit , but the only thing you fell in love with this week was winning .
that is absolutely not true .
oh , yes , it is .
and you know what?
i love winning too .
more than anything .
more than anyone .
don't say that .
you don't mean it .
i do .
love means nothing in tennis .
zero .
it only means you lose .
she's dropping her arm too soon after the toss .
honestly
can i say what i mean don't you play with me
'cause i'm a lady
you must clear your head .
you must forget about her .
love is shit , just like she said .
yeah .
he's absolutely right .
just ask my soon to be ex wife .
ask all my ex wives .
thanks for the words of wisdom , ron .
shouldn't you be off sucking up tojake?
i took care of that at breakfast .
you gave her a taste ofher medicine .
you're in the finals .
it's time to move on , same as she would .
i don't want to move ...
feel that?
ow !
i'll take that as a yes .
look , i'm not making any promises , but if you keep relatively still , you should be in a decent state for the finals .
yes . !
we got it .
frito lay .
what?
you are the new spokesperson for their brand new chip .
surprisingly zesty , it's called .
that's you , pal .
oh , god .
i've gotta get out of here .
no .
no way .
you heard the good doctor .
let's get you some room service .
i would kill for another dozen of those ... what do you call the ... those little cucumber sandwiches?
cucumber sandwiches .
you brits got a name for everything , huh?
and in other news , the kuiper belt comet armstrong flynn ... finally disappeared from view today after blazing for nearly a ... [ tvswitches off ]
there's a distance between us and you take the blame i know that you tried but at this stage of the game
i've started a new life there's no turning back
why , jennifer?
will you now don't you know can't you see i get over
sometimes i wonder
where this feeling began
deep in my heart right from the start right from the start tired and lonely i move on from this pain
i'm starting again i'm breakin'the chain
yeah , all right .
i'm going .
i'm going .
oh , for god's sake , carl .
carl !
for god's sake , what ...
didn't i tell you always to knock before entering a room?
well , it's a bit late now .
you better come in and have some breakfast .
what do you want?
eggs and soldiers?
oh , eggs will be fine .
sit down .
morning , son .
where's the marmalade?
well , uh , i'm out of the tree house .
yeah , you certainly are .
your mother and i seem to have found some common ground at long last .
oh , really .
what's that?
you , peter .
you're , uh , probably aware that things have been a bit sticky for the last few , well , years actually .
the fact is that , uh , in the end , the only thing we shared was the downstairs toilet , and she wasn't really keen on that .
i think what i'm trying to say is that ... we'd forgotten just what an inspiration you are to both of us .
that's meant to be the other way around actually , i know .
but how very proud we are of you .
it's been a long time since we've done this .
too bloody long .
dad?
hmm?
my back .
oh , god .
well , it's been quite a fortnight , hasn't it?
not just for peter , but for all of us .
i , for one , will admit ... and that's not a word i like very much .
but we could all do better ... to love and support each other unconditionally .
without judgment , without ...
for god's sake , carl , stop biting your fingernails .
you're not a bloody infant !
augusta !
you were saying , darling?
yes , i'm sorry .
i just wanted to propose a toast .
to the family .
our family .
it's a trick .
our family .
our family .
oh , bloody marvelous .
no , darling .
we're bad luck .
if we came and you lost , i would never be able to forgive myself .
i don't believe in luck anymore .
listen , win or lose , and i can't see how i'm possibly going to win ,
tomorrow will be my last professional tennis match .
and i can't imagine the three of you not being there .
so , please .
so what you're saying is jake's the safe bet then .
good morning .
it's radio 1 at 7 : 00 .
i'm chris moyles .
so today's the day .
it's the big finals .
peter colt , what an amazing man .
who would have thought?
i didn't think he was gonna do it .
now , i'm starting to think ... morning , everyone .
bbc london 94 . 9 .
and it's here .
it is wimbledon finals day .
i'll try to be detached , i try to be cool , but i'm carried away .
come on , colty . !
good luck , mr. colt .
thank you .
thank you very much .
all the best , mr. colt .
thank you .
thanks very much .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you so much .
thanks .
thank you .
thank you very much .
an englishman in the final .
fantastic !
if you could win that cup , sir , we'd all be so proud .
i'll do my best .
and i don't even like tennis .
ready , sir?
yeah , i think i am .
peter colt , seen here in his teens , has already declared this to be his last competitive match .
and what an exit .
only a matter of days ago ,
colt had become no more than a fading blip on the radar of tennis history .
now he's become the man who ...
not to add the pressure , peter , but you know the entire united kingdom is cheering you on today .
yes .
well , let's hope i don't disappoint them .
did you have any realistic hope two weeks ago that you would be here today preparing to walk onto ...
lizzie , i love you more than life itself , but i can't turn off every goddamned television set in the united kingdom .
i'm going for a walk .
flight board's in half an hour .
what do you attribute this remarkable run to?
you were supposed to make a very early exit .
well , i had a bit of luck against tom cavendish in the quarters , and i played a more focused game ... passionate game , uh ...
i suppose the real answer to your question is , uh , well , love really .
love of the game?
yeah , love of the game .
um ...
but , listen , you may have read about lizzie bradbury and myself ... being involved , so to speak .
but , um , i'd like to take this opportunity to set the record straight .
i read the papers this morning , and , uh , they seem to imply ... that lizzie had let me down in some way .
that's just not the case .
the truth is i let her down .
i let her down , and for that ...
i'll always be truly sorry .
listen , i'm not in the habit ... of pouring my heart out on television .
i'm not really in the habit of pouring my heart out at all .
lizzie , sweetheart , something i think you ought to see .
i'm seeing it .
so if this comes out wrong , forgive me .
lizzie bradbury .
lizzie is the reason that i'm here today .
that's all i really came here to say except thank you .
thank you , peter .
i , uh , have a new theory of our life of tennis .
tell me .
oh , it's simple really .
you hit the ball back over the net ... as hard and as deep ... and as often as possible .
sorry to disturb you , peter .
the members have invited you to use the number one dressing room .
oh , no .
thank you , danny .
i think i'd rather stay here .
right .
that's what i told 'em you'd say .
good luck , my friend .
in a few minutes , colt and hammond will be making the walk ... through the tunnel onto center court .
a little stroll , chrissy , that i'm sure you'd agree is about the number one highlight of a tennis player's career .
except for the butterflies i always felt , absolutely .
no , he can't just wear the hat .
no , we don't 'cause we don't have an endorsement deal .
that's why .
well , then he knows the number .
peter .
i tried to warn you about her .
by the way , how's the weak back?
it's fine .
thanks .
how's the weak mind?
gentlemen .
fuck a duck .
jake hammond has been on an absolute tear .
he's lost only one set this entire tournament .
and look who he's had to beat .
hewitt , federer .
well , with the exception of dragomir and tom cavendish ,
colt's road to this final has been a relative pushover .
right .
but he's played some great tennis .
but my guess here is that he's more than a little overmatched today .
first set .
hammond to serve .
i gotta go .
peter !
peter !
peter !
ladies and gentlemen , quiet please .
ready .
play .
15 love .
yes , thanks .
i'll be needing that .
he said , " thanks .
i'll be needing that .
quiet please .
go , jake !
come on , jake .
30 love .
40 love .
oh , that poor kid . !
he was on the receiving end of one of the fastest recorded serves in professional tennis .
144 miles per hour .
well , we certainly hope he's all right .
and that reminds me how lucky i was , chrissy .
i ball boy'd in the old days when they used wood rackets .
and things were a lot slower .
oh , you bastard .
it's one thing to humiliate me , but you didn't have to mess with the boy .
now you're going down , you bastard .
or maybe not .
colt to serve .
love 15 .
love 40 .
game ...
hammond .
40 love .
game and this set ...
hammond .
30 love .
game ...
hammond .
new balls , please .
love 15 .
hammond leads five games to two .
game ...
hammond .
love 30 .
15 30 .
15 40 .
peter colt finds himself once again at break point .
he really can't afford to go down another break this early in the third set .
he seems completely lost out there , john .
lost and confused .
we may be witnessing ... the near total collapse of a player's game .
at a moment like this , chrissy , you have to wonder ... what the hell is going through peter colt's mind .
please , god .
please make it end .
game ...
hammond .
play suspended .
what are you doing , lad?
get in here .
it ain't over till the handshake , lad .
danny , i'm not really in the mood for a pep talk right now .
well , you better get ready for one .
hi .
i thought you'd gone .
yeah .
me too .
having a tough day?
well , you know , disastrous .
except for the fact that you didn't go gooey when the ball boy got hit .
yeah .
sorry .
why are you british apologizing all the time?
don't apologize to me .
i love you .
apologize to the people who are rooting for you out there .
what'd you say?
i said that the whole country has been waiting ...
no .
no .
the other bit .
i said i love you .
see , that's very good news .
i thought i was alone in the love department .
well , turns out you've got company .
i am so sorry .
if you say sorry one more time , you're going to be sorry .
i meant about the other night .
shh !
stop it .
forget about that .
this is about you .
go out there and decide who you are .
and who might that be?
that might be a winner .
please be patient , mr. hammond .
please sit down .
the question is , where's peter colt?
did he flee the building with the rain?
i think he's in the lavatory .
isn't that a comfort break?
is it?
yes .
they are allowed one .
if he's got a jumpy tummy .
so , if he doesn't come back ...
he's gonna lose .
of course i want to win .
i do .
but he's just better than me .
no .
he's not .
i'm two sets down .
my back's killing me .
you're going to play through the pain .
i'm too tired .
my legs are like lead .
find a second wind .
it's what winners do .
his serve is unstoppable .
no , it's not .
it's a bundle of tells .
what?
his serve .
it's like a book .
you just have to know how to read it .
you know i really don't care who wins .
i mean , i represent both players .
it's like asking me which one of my kids i love more .
which one of my kids do i love more?
my daughter .
i'll talk to you later .
well , peter colt is back .
let's hope he's better .
so far this match has been a blowout .
yeah , pete !
peter !
ladies and gentlemen , as play resumes , hammond leads ... two sets to love and one game to love .
hammond to serve .
play .
go , pete . !
lfhe bounces the ball once instead of twice , he's going for the body .
lfhe shifts back on his left heel and shows you his toe , it means he's hitting deep .
colt sure seemed to have hammond's number on that one , chrissy .
which is a good sign ifhe's gonna climb out of the giant hole he's dug himself .
ouch .
you all right?
yeah .
welcome back .
same to you , sir .
station ident ready to roll .
eight , top of your shot .
we got a visitor .
john , did you see who just came in?
that'll give an immediate adrenaline burst .
yes !
he did it , chrissy .
he pulled out the set .
oh !
yes !
after a great comeback in the third set , colt's game has leveled .
and he and jake hammond are even at 5 all in this tie break .
so , john , this next point is crucial ... if colt wants to keep this comeback alive .
come on , peter !
okay .
5 5 in the breaker .
here we go .
6 5 ...
hammond .
jake hammond is up 6 5 in the tie breaker , and he's finally gotten himself a championship point .
this could be the final point of peter colt's pro career .
right here , right now .
ladies and gentlemen , quiet please .
this could be it , chrissy .
l lf his heel moves left , he's going right .
or is it the toss?
yes .
l l lf he tosses high , i it ...
oh , sod it !
6 all .
incredible point .
i'm doin'a complete 180 on peter colt .
this is amazing persistence from thejourneyman player .
i was already thinking about gettin'to the airport .
we may be going to a fifth set , and if i was jake hammond , i'd want to close this thing out right now .
the last thing he wants is another set with the momentum going in the other direction .
okay .
first one to win by two .
ladies and gentlemen , quiet please .
7 6 ...
colt .
wow .
a double fault .
now it looks like hammond's the one who's getting tight .
peter colt now has set point to force a fifth and deciding set .
aw , give us a goddamn break !
please , shut off all mobile phones .
thank you .
yeah .
unbelievable . !
we're gonna play five . !
advantage ...
colt .
rising star peter colt has battled back .
game ...
colt .
peter colt san .
game point .
colt leads five games to four .
final set .
well , colt has broken jake hammond .
and after this changeover , he's gonna be serving for the wimbledon title .
listen , an hour ago , i didn't think he'd find anybody to give him a ride home .
no question , john .
and now it's all up to him .
i mean , he's finally got a chance to serve out the match .
time .
break you right back , asshole .
did you see that?
that is some definite gamesmanship from jake hammond .
come on , peter .
15 love .
come on !
peter colt is now three points away from winning wimbledon .
one point at a time , peter .
one point at a time .
it's just another point .
it's just another point .
like hell it is .
you could be the champion of wimbledon , which means you wouldn't have to take the pro job for starters .
you could buy a new place , redecorate .
lizzie could help with that .
oh , god knows what taste she has .
oh , shut up , you silly ponce .
30 love .
make that two points away , chrissy .
come on , peter . !
ladies and gentlemen , quiet please .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
come on , pete .
30 15 .
chrissy , we talked about colt's reputation in the past ... as a choker when it comes to big points .
well , this is primo choke time .
i wouldn't be surprised if colt got real tight now .
thank you .
it's my fault .
peter . !
peter . !
peter . !
don't choke .
don't choke .
don't choke .
don't choke .
please don't choke .
please don't choke .
don't choke .
i'm not gonna choke , damn it .
40 15 .
peter . !
do you believe it?
peter colt is serving a championship point .
quiet please .
ladies and gentlemen , quiet please .
championship point .
right then .
out .
40 30 .
i don't believe it .
that was a terrible call for colt .
no !
what the hell?
what?
look at the chalk fly .
the ball was definitely in .
it was on the line .
it was on the line !
i'd be torching the stadium about now .
excuse me !
the ball was good .
40 30 .
oh , come on .
the ball was good .
chalk flew up .
the whole stadium saw it .
i don't know if you've noticed , but it's quite an important point .
that's too close for me to overrule .
please resume play .
absolutely not .
i'm not playing .
this is complete bollocks .
absolutely bollocks .
code violation .
unsportsmanlike conduct .
warning , mr. colt .
in . !
in . !
in . !
oh , my ...
okay , here we go .
peter colt has his second chance now to win the championship .
the question is , can he do it?
after a call like that ... a lot of players , including yours truly , would have a hard time getting back in the mind set .
ladies and gentlemen , quiet please .
that serve wasn't even close .
it wasn't fast either .
i believe you to be a truly great tennis player .
ultimately disappointing .
total collapse of a player's ... [ thinking ]
stop it .
you have to stop it .
now .
yes !
he's done it . !
he has done it . !
thejourneyman has won . !
a wild card entry .
ranked 119th in the world .
now champion of wimbledon . !
call letterman .
call leno .
call oprah .
call kimmel .
it's utter pandemonium here .
i've never seen anything like this in my life .
the brits finally have a winner .
what's wrong with you?
you bet on jake?
i bet it all on you , bro !
can i retire now , mum !
certainly not !
augusta !
well done , son .
we love you .
he seems to be lookin 'for somebody else .
i think the whole world knows who he's lookin'for .
there's so much i want to say to you .
i'm not going anywhere .
oh , yes , you are .
you're going a long , long way .
nothing could possibly match that moment .
it's everything you wait a lifetime for .
that dream finally come true .
what else could ever come close?
except this , maybe .
i did take a job at a club .
but teaching young kids like my own , not old ladies .
yeah !
and i love it .
i beat you .
i beat you .
rubbish .
the ball was in .
it was definite ...
ow !
well , most of the time .
you see , a part of me was always afraid that my life would be over if i wasn't playing tennis .
but the truth is , it was reallyjust beginning .
oh , and by the way , lizzie did win the u. s. open .
and wimbledon .
twice .
