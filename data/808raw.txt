wolfie?
what?
there's a young girl here to see you .
what does she want?
she won't talk to me .
she says she has to speak to you .
damn .
yes?
are you herr mozart?
that's right .
my name is lorl , sir .
i 'm a maidservant .
i was asked to come here and offer my services to you .
they'll be paid for by an admirer of yours who wishes to remain . . . . . . anonymous .
is this your idea , papa?
mine?
are you playing a trick on me?
i've never seen this girl .
is this some kind of joke?
not at all , sir .
young woman , this won't do .
my son can't accept such an offer , no matter how generous . . . . . . unless he knows who's behind it .
i can't tell you that , sir .
this is ridiculous !
what is ridiculous?
wolfie has many admirers in vienna .
people send us gifts all the time .
you cannot accept her without references .
well , this is none of your business .
whoever sent you is going to pay?
that's right .
splendid !
now we 're going to let a stranger into our house .
who is we?
who is letting who?
could you please wait outside?
yes , ma'am .
look , old man !
we spend a fortune on you , and all you can do is criticize .
and now  stanzi !
no !
it's right that he should hear !
i 'm sick to death of it .
we can't do anything right for you , can we?
you won't have to do anything for me ever again .
i 'm leaving .
no , papa .
i won't stay and be a burden .
no one calls you that .
she does .
she says i sleep all day .
and so you do !
the only time you come out is to eat .
well , what do you expect?
do you expect anyone to walk out into a mess like this every day?
so now i 'm a bad housekeeper !
so you are .
it's a pigsty .
when can you start?
right away , ma'am .
good .
they 're out every night , sir .
thank you , sir .
do any pupils come to the house?
not that i've seen .
then how does he pay for all this?
does he work at all?
yes , sir .
all day long .
he never leaves the house till evening .
he just sits there , writing and writing .
really?
what is it he's writing?
i wouldn't know that , sir .
of course not .
you 're a good girl .
you 're very kind to do this .
the next time you 're sure they'll be out of the house , let me know .
thank you , sir .
i think i found out about the money .
yes?
what?
he kept seven snuff boxes in here .
i could swear they were all gold .
and now look .
there's only one left .
where does he work?
i have just heard some news that may be of interest to you .
what?
mozart is writing a new opera .
an ltalian opera .
ltalian?
that's not all .
he has chosen for his subject , figaro .
the marriage of figaro .
he is setting that play to music?
yes .
what is this marriage of figaro?
it's a french play , kappelmeister .
it has been banned by the emperor .
you're absolutely sure?
gentlemen , sit down .
are you aware that i have declared the french play of figaro ... ... unsuitable for our theatre?
yes , sire .
yet we hear you're making an opera from it .
ls this true?
who told you?
it is not your place to ask questions .
ls it true?
yes .
i admit it is .
would you tell me why?
majesty , it is only a comedy .
what you think ... ... is scarcely the point .
it's what his majesty thinks that counts .
i am a tolerant man .
i do not censor things lightly .
when i do , i have good reason .
figaro ... ... is a bad play .
it stirs up hatred between classes .
ln france it has caused nothing but bitterness .
my sister antoinette writes me that she is beginning ... ... to be frightened of her own people .
sire , i swear to you , there's nothing like that in the piece .
i took out everything that could give offense .
i hate politics .
i'm afraid you're rather innocent , my friend .
ln these dangerous times ... ... l cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people ... ... simply over a theatre piece .
majesty , this is just a frolic .
a piece about love .
love .
again !
and it's new !
it's entirely new .
it's so new that people will go mad for it .
i have scenes ....
the end of the second act , for example ....
it's a simple duet ... ... just a husband and a wife quarreling .
suddenly ... ... the wife's scheming little maid comes in .
it's a very funny situation .
duet turns into trio .
the valet enters .
he's plotting with the maid .
trio turns into quartet .
then a gardener comes in .
quartet becomes quintet , and so on and on ... ... sextet , septet , octet .
how long do you think i can sustain that?
i have no idea .
guess .
guess , your majesty .
lmagine the longest it could be sustained ... ... then double it .
6?
7 minutes .
8 minutes?
20 , sire !
20 minutes !
20 minutes of continuous music .
no recitatives !
only opera can do this .
ln a play , if more than one person speaks at once ... ... it's just noise .
no one can understand a word .
but with opera , with music ....
with music you can have 20 individuals all talking at the same time .
and it's not noise .
it's a perfect harmony !
music is not the issue .
no one doubts your talent .
it's your literary judgment that's in question .
even with the politics taken out of it , it would still remain a vulgar farce .
why waste your spirit on such rubbish?
surely ... ... you can choose more elevated themes .
elevated !
what does that mean , elevated?
i am fed ... ... to the teeth with these ... ... elevated things .
old dead legends .
why must we go on forever ... ... writing only about gods and legends?
because they do .
they go on forever .
at least what they represent : the eternal in us .
opera is here to ennoble us , mozart .
you and me , just the same as his majesty .
come on now , be honest !
who wouldn't rather listen to a hairdresser than hercules?
or horatius or orpheus .
so lofty , they sound as if they shit marble !
what !
govern your tongue , mozart , how dare you !
forgive me , majesty .
i'm a vulgar man .
but , i assure you , my music is not .
you are passionate , mozart ... ... but you do not persuade .
sire , the whole opera is finished .
you know how much work i did?
his majesty has been ... ... more than patient .
how can i persuade you if i can't show it?
that will do .
let me tell how it begins .
may i just do that?
show how it begins?
please .
there's a servant down on his knees .
and do you know why?
not from any oppression , no .
because he's measuring a space .
do you know what for?
his bed .
his wedding bed .
to see if it will fit !
late !
on the beat .
good !
yes !
early !
mozart is already rehearsing .
ln that case , gentlemen , i think ...
... we should help him all we can .
and do our best to protect him against the emperor's anger .
what anger?
about the ballet .
what ballet?
excuse me ... ... but didn't his majesty specifically ... ... forbid the ballet at his opera?
a word with you .
certainly , herr direktor .
now , herr mozart !
five minutes , please .
do you not know that his majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in operas?
it's not a ballet , it's a dance at figaro's wedding .
exactly .
a dance .
surely , his majesty didn't mean no dancing when it's in the story .
it is dangerous to interpret his edicts .
give me your score , please .
thank you .
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
taking out what you should never have put in .
please .
i have no one else to turn to .
what is it?
it's unbelievable .
the direktor has actually torn up a huge section of my music .
they say i have to rewrite the opera .
but it's perfect as it is .
i can't ... ... rewrite what's perfect .
please .
can't you talk to him?
why bother with rosenberg?
he's no friend of yours .
i could kill him .
i mean , really !
kill him !
i threw the entire score into the fire , he made me so angry .
you burned the score?
no , my wife took it out in time .
thank god .
it's unfair that a man like that should have power over our work .
but others have power over him .
i think i'll take this up with the emperor .
excellency ... ... would you?
with all my heart , mozart .
thank you .
please , herr mozart .
please , it's not a holy relic .
i don't need to tell you i said nothing whatever to the emperor .
i went to the theatre to tell mozart something , anything ... ... when suddenly ... ... in the middle of the third act ... ... to my astonishment , the emperor ... ... who never attended rehearsals ... ... suddenly appeared .
what is this?
i don't understand .
ls it modern?
the herr direktor ... ... he has removed un balletto ... ... that would have occurred at this place .
why?
it's your regulation .
no ballet in your opera .
do you like this?
it's not a question of liking .
your own law decrees it , i'm afraid .
look at them !
this is nonsense !
let me see the scene with the music .
oblige me !
can we see the scene with the music back , please?
certainly !
certainly , herr direktor .
bring the palace set back in , please .
the restored third act ... ... was bold , brilliant .
the fourth ... ... was astounding .
i saw a woman ... ... disguised in her maid's clothes ... ... hear her husband speak the first tender words he'd offered her in years .
simply because he thinks she is someone else .
i heard the music of true forgiveness filling the theatre ... ... conferring on all who sat there perfect absolution .
god was singing through this little man ... ... to all the world .
unstoppable .
making my defeat more bitter with every passing bar .
and then ... do you know what happened?
a miracle !
with that yawn ... ... l saw my defeat turn ... ... into a victory .
mozart was lucky the emperor yawned only once .
three yawns ... ... and the opera would fail the same night .
two yawns ... ... within a week at most .
with one yawn ... ... the composer could still get ... ... nine performances !
nine , that's all it's had ... and withdrawn .
i know , i know .
it's outrageous .
still , if the public doesn't like one's work ... ... one has to accept the fact gracefully .
but what is it they don't like?
i can speak for the emperor .
you make too many demands on the royal ear .
he can't concentrate over an hour .
you gave him four .
what did you think of it?
did you like it at all?
i thought it was marvelous .
of course .
it's the best opera yet written !
i know it .
why didn't they come?
i think you overestimate our dear viennese , my friend .
you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs ... ... to tell them when to clap .
i know .
you should give me lessons in that .
i wouldn't presume .
nevertheless , at the risk of imposing ... ... l'd like you to see my new piece .
it would be a tremendous honor for me .
no , the honor would be all mine .
i believe ... ... l believe ... ... it is the best opera ... ... yet written , my friends .
you are the brightest star ... ... in the musical firmament .
you do honor to vienna ... ... and to me .
it was good of you to come .
how could i not?
bravo , maestro .
did my work please you?
i never knew that music like that was possible .
you flatter me .
one hears such sounds ... ... and what can one say but ... ... salieri !
everybody's here and we've got guests .
i've got some more .
you remember my good friend schikaneder .
come in !
don't be shy .
this is ... ... a very nice girl , and this is too ....
yes , my love?
these gentlemen are from salzburg .
we were just talking about salzburg .
your father is dead .
so rose ... ... the dreadful ghost , from his next ... ... and blackest opera .
there , on the stage , stood the figure of a dead commander .
and i knew ... ... only i understood ... ... that the horrifying apparition was leopold ... ... raised from the dead !
wolfgang had summoned up his own father ... ... to accuse his son before all the world !
it was ... ... terrifying and wonderful to watch .
and now ...
... the madness began in me .
the madness of a man splitting in half .
through my influence , i saw to it ... ... don giovanni was played only five times in vienna .
but , in secret , i went to every one of those five .
worshipping sound ... ... l alone seemed to hear .
as i stood there , understanding ... ... how that bitter old man still possessed his poor son ... ... even from beyond the grave ... ... l began to see a way ... ... a terrible way ... ... l could finally triumph ... ... over god .
i have come to commission work from you .
what work?
a mass for the dead .
what dead?
who's dead?
a man who deserved a requiem mass ... ... and never got one .
who are you?
i am only a messenger .
do you accept?
you'll be well paid .
do you accept?
work fast .
and be sure to tell no one what you do .
you will see me again soon .
my plan was so simple ... ... that it terrified me .
first , i must get the death mass , and then ... ... l must achieve his death .
what?
his funeral !
lmagine it !
the cathedral ... ... all vienna sitting there .
his coffin ... ... mozart's little coffin in the middle .
and then ... ... in that silence ... ... music !
a divine music bursts out over them all .
a great mass of death .
requiem mass for wolfgang mozart .
composed by his devoted friend ... ... antonio salieri .
what sublimity !
what depth !
what passion in the music !
salieri has been touched by god at last ... ... and god forced to listen .
powerless to stop it !
i , for once , in the end , laughing at him !
the only thing that worried me ... ... was the actual killing .
how does one do that?
how does one kill a man?
it's one thing ... ... to dream about it .
very different when you ... ... when you have to do it ... ... with your own hands .
come in !
i've come to dinner .
dinner !
are you mad?
i'm a nobleman .
i only ever dine with people of my own height .
stop it !
be careful !
be careful !
hold tight !
i'm a famous ... ... horseman
and we're a famous horsie
give me a hoof my darling
and i'll give you my heart
take me to your stable
and never more we'll part
kill me !
kill me !
we're going to make a soprano stew
and when you make a soprano stew
shut up !
i'm sick to death of that tune !
give him some hay , my darling
and i'll give you my heart
leporello !
some hay !
we hope you're contented
with what we've presented
and love our dove of peace
what did you think?
wonderful !
he liked the little people .
it's all in good fun .
i liked the horse .
i tell you , if you played don giovanni here ... ... you would have had a wonderful success .
you belong here !
not at the snobby court .
you could do anything you like .
the more fantastic , the better .
that's what people want : fantasy !
you write a proper part for me and a couple of catchy songs ... ... l guarantee you a triumph deluxe !
what do you say?
how much will you pay him?
i see you brought your manager with you .
well , madame ... ... how about ... ... half the receipts?
half the receipts !
i'm talking about now .
how much will you pay him now?
down payment .
down payment?
who do you think i am , the emperor?
i have to go .
stay , you'll enjoy this .
you won't do this .
why not?
half the house !
when?
we need money now !
either he pays you now , or you don't do it .
i don't trust that man .
and i don't like what he did with your opera .
it was common .
you liked it .
monkey , punky , flunky !
half the house !
you'll never see a penny .
i want it here in my hand .
i'll put it here in your hand .
you won't put a thing in my hand until i see some money !
it's embarrassing .
can't you think of anyone who can do something for him?
i 'm afraid mozart is a lost cause , baron .
he has succeeded in alienating practically the whole of vienna .
he never pays his debts .
i can 't think of anyone to whom i'd dare recommend him .
herr mozart .
what a surprise !
what can i do for you?
is my pupil still interested in learning the art of music?
your pupil is married and living in mannheim , young man .
really?
perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction .
what is it , mozart?
what's the matter with you?
well . . . . . . since it appears no one is eager to hire my services . . .
. . . could you favor me with a little money instead?
what for?
if a man cannot earn , he must borrow .
that's hardly the way to go about it .
you are right , sir .
you are right .
but you see , i am endowed with talent , and you with money .
if i offer mine . . . . . . you should offer yours .
i'm sorry , no .
please .
my answer is no , mozart .
please .
please !
don't answer it .
why?
tell him i'm not here .
tell him i'm working on it .
come back later .
am i interrupting something?
no .
good .
where's our friend?
he's not here .
but he said he's working on it .
is that it?
is he happy with it?
what's this?
a requiem mass?
you think i'm in the funeral business?
put it down !
put it down !
put it down , it's nothing for you !
i'm sorry .
what have you got for me?
finished?
what?
the vaudeville , what do you think?
yes .
can i see it?
no .
why not?
because there's nothing to see .
i asked you if we could start rehearsals next week and you said yes .
we can .
so let me see it .
where is it?
here .
it's all right here in my noodle .
the rest is just scribbling .
scribbling and bibbling , bibbling and scribbling .
want a drink?
do you know how many people i've hired for you?
leave him alone !
i'm paying these people !
he's doing his best .
i'm paying them to wait for you .
it's ridiculous !
you know what's ridiculous?
your libretto's ridiculous !
only an idiot would ask wolfie to work on that !
12 foot snakes , magic flutes?
what's so intelligent about a requiem?
money .
you're mad .
she's mad .
wolfie , write it down .
just write it down .
on paper .
it's no use to anybody in your head .
to hell with your death mass !
calm yourself .
what's the matter with you?
i'm not working there anymore .
what has happened?
you don't know what it's like .
herr mozart frightens me .
he drinks all day ... ... then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse .
is he working?
i'm frightened , sir , really !
when he speaks he makes no sense .
is he working?
i suppose so .
he sits there all the time , doing some silly opera .
please , don't ask me to go back again .
i'm frightened .
i'm very , very frightened !
are you sure it's an opera?
i don't have it yet .
are you neglecting my request?
i promise you .
i'll give you the best piece i ever
this is my wife .
i've been sick but i'm all right now , aren't i?
yes , sir .
he's all right .
and he's working on it very hard .
two more weeks .
please .
the sooner you finish , the greater your reward .
work !
i think you really are going mad .
you work like a slave for that idiot actor who won't give you a penny !
and here ....
this is not a ghost !
this is a real man who puts down real money .
why on earth won't you finish it?
can you give me one reason i can understand?
it's killing me .
you're drunk , aren't you?
be honest , tell me .
you've been drinking .
it's not fair .
i worry about you all the time .
i do everything i can to help you .
and all you do is drink and talk nonsense , and frighten me .
go to bed !
please .
let me sit here .
let me stay here with you .
i did it !
and i was proud to do it .
leave , i said !
right away !
and take the child with you !
here's the money !
go to the spa ... ... and get your health back .
i was shocked ... ... shocked to my foundation when i saw her .
i couldn't believe my eyes , poor little thing .
you monster !
no one exists but you , do they?
you and your music .
i warned her .
choose a man , not a baby , " i said .
you marry him , you won't have a pot to piss in .
you selfish thing !
selfish , that's what you are .
selfish .
simply selfish !
do you hear me?
pick him up .
be careful !
come with me !
you !
follow me .
is it over?
yes , it's over .
it's over .
go !
go !
where is your wife?
where is your wife?
she's not well either .
she went to the spa .
you are so good to me .
truly .
thank you .
please !
no , i mean , to come to my opera .
you are the only colleague of mine who came .
i would never miss anything you had written .
it's just a vaudeville .
it's a sublime piece .
the grandest operone !
i tell you ... ... you are the greatest composer known to me .
do you mean it?
it's him !
the man .
he's here .
tell him to go away .
tell him i'm still working on it .
don't let him in .
wait !
ask him if he would give me some money now .
tell him it will help me finish .
can we come in?
better not .
he's sleeping .
he's all right?
yes , he's just exhausted .
he became dizzy .
that's all .
tell him we came by , won't you?
of course .
give him this .
that's his share .
that should cheer him up .
indeed !
and now good night to you all .
it was ... ... perfection .
truly !
thank you .
what happened?
he said to give you this .
and if you finish by tomorrow ... ... he'll pay 100 ducats more .
that's too soon !
tomorrow night ....
it's impossible !
did he say 100?
it's too soon !
could i help you?
would you?
actually , you could .
i want to go !
where?
back to vienna .
now?
yes .
why?
i feel wrong .
i feel wrong being here .
where did i stop?
the end of the recordare .
so .
now , confutatis ... ... when the wicked are confounded .
how would you translate that?
consigned to flames of woe .
you believe in it?
a fire which never dies , burning you forever .
yes .
is it possible?
let's begin .
we ended in f major .
so now ... ... a minor .

then we'll finish the lacrimosa .
i can keep going , i assure you !

i won't leave you !
i'm so ashamed .
of what?
i was foolish .
i thought you did not care for my work ... ... or me .
forgive me .
what are you doing here?
your husband ... ... took sick .
i brought him home .
why you?
because madame , i was at hand .
thank you very much , you can go now .
he needs me .
no , he doesn't ... ... and i don't want you here .
just go , please .
he asked me to stay .
and i'm asking
i'm back .
i missed you so much .
if you'd just ... ... show me that you need me .
and i'll try to do better , too .
what is this?
no , wolfie , not this .
you're not to work on this ever again .
i've decided .
it's not his handwriting .
no , it's mine .
i was assisting him .
he's not to work on this anymore .
it's making him ill .
good night .
i regret we have no servants to show you out , herr salieri .
respect my wish and go .
i will respect his .
your merciful god .
he destroyed his own beloved ... ... rather than let a mediocrity ... ... share in the smallest part of his glory .
he killed mozart .
and kept me alive to torture .
32 years of torture .
32 years ... ... of slowly watching myself become extinct !
my music ... ... growing fainter .
all the time fainter ... ... till no one plays it at all .
and his ....
good morning !
time for the water closet .
then we have your favorite breakfast .
sugar rolls !
he loves those .
fresh sugar rolls .
i will speak for you , father .
i speak for all mediocrities in the world .
i am their champion .
i am their patron saint .
mediocrities everywhere ... ... i absolve you .
i absolve you .
i absolve you all .
