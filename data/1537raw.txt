who are we going with?
with god .
in these rivers on the plains ... ... one should always have sacred company .
without the right company , the boatman doesn't travel in peace .
especially ... ... since you came into the land of ms. barbara .
in other words , in the lion's den .
really , boss?
that and more , young man .
do you know that woman's story?
it is told by the voice of the plains .
and that voice does not lie .
from beyond the cunaviche .
from beyond the sinaruco .
from beyond the meta .
farther away than far itself ... ... is where that woman came from .
her origin is lost in the mystery of virgin lands .
she grew up in a boat that sailed ... ... the rivers of the jungle around the orinoco river .
there were six men on board .
they were tough and brutal .
their lustful eyes feasted ... ... upon the nascent beauty ... ... of the woman she was starting to become .
one afternoon ... ... when the boat was about to sail off ... ... a young man approached the captain .
he was nice looking ... ... well mannered , but poorly dressed .
his name was asdrubal .
he wanted to go to rio negro .
since he had no money ... ... he agreed to work in exchange for his fare .
and love , to which her soul was maybe predisposed ... ... was soon contemplating her ... ... with a tender smile .
but wicked passions were stalking her .
one night , while the boss was on land ... ... the sailors wagered in a card game ... ... the girl's innocence .
now her soul can only harbor a grudge ... ... and nothing can placate her loathing toward men .
sometime after that ... ... she showed up here on that boat , trading food ... ... for animal skins among the ranches along the banks .
so her fortune began .
the rest she obtained through witchcraft and evil doings .
and now she owns most of the arauca .
presiding over lands and lives ... ... herds and savannas ... ... the plains fear her and obey her .
her beauty fascinates men .
her gold buys laws that protect her ... ... and hired hands that kill for her .
ms. barbara .
the fearsome ms. barbara .
her .
her alone , and always ... ... implacable .
the man eater .
now she's not quite eating men .
now .
you're seeing things , lorencito .
where do you see ms. barbara?
is she separate from the plains?
the terrible female .
the man eater .
you're drunk on that stuff .
leave it be , lorenzo barquero .
all you can think about is ms. barbara .
your favorite topic : the terrible female .
she took over your will and ... ... sucked out your brain and your marrow .
she took your farm and your land ... ... and when you had nothing left at all ... ... she slammed the door of your house on your face .
enough .
don't be angry with me , lorencito .
i'm your pal .
i was just saying that now ms. barbara ... ... is herding others 'cattle , not eating men .
all the cattle she can get today in altamira .
not hers .
whatever moves on these plains is hers .
she is violence , the terrible female who owns this land .
bravo .
are you thinking about your cousin ... ... doctor santos luzardo who owns that cattle ... ... that she's rounding up before he arrives?
what did you say?
santos luzardo is coming?
that's right .
to watch over his herd in altamira .
he hired a boat in san fernando .
he'll be here soon .
a luzardo in the arauca region again .
he'll still find a barquero here .
you're what's left?
not much man left then .
yes , me .
the last barquero against the last luzardo .
you're pouring whisky on the floor .
you don't have the nerve to continue ... ... the war between barqueros and luzardos .
everyone's dead .
let's change the subject .
i have a business proposition for you .
business?
that's right .
ms. barbara left you in ruin .
but also a capital which can ... ... pay you good dividends later on .
the daughter you sired with her , marisela .
that's a pretty name for her .
she's a luscious woman now .
what do you mean?
i want to have marisela in this house .
i came here to hunt tigers .
but i'm tired of living alone all the time .
now brag that the man eater can't beat you .
me strong man .
look , my hand doesn't tremble .
don't change the subject , lorencito .
i said i want to have marisela here .
here in my home .
you mean you want to marry her?
i didn't say that .
i brought 48 bottles of whisky from san fernando .
good whisky that costs a bundle ... ... to drink with my friend lorenzo barquero .
lorencito still had some dignity left .
and he was angry at his friend mr. guillermo .
but he heard that there are 48 bottles here .
what's the meaning of this?
didn't we agree i'd never see you again?
but i need to talk to you ... ... about our daughter , not about me .
our?
is there something that belongs to us both?
you took all i had , but i'm not here for that .
i ask for protection for marisela .
a bad man's lust .
what bad man would that be?
mr. guillermo .
ah .
your friend with whom you get drunk every day .
he wants your daughter as payment?
you can prevent that for her sake .
you scum .
well , i will do something .
i'll send her some advice , listen well .
tell her to dominate that man's will .
like you bewitched me?
yes .
to bewitch him , to ruin him like you did to me .
really?
poor creature of god .
but listen ...
out of my sight .
my chile .
my chile .
what doing here , what if animals bite you?
i can cure myself with herbs .
look what i brought for you .
sweet as honey .
goodness .
anything else , juan primito?
nothing more .
nothing more .
then you say you care about me .
little one , didn't i carry you since you was baby?
don't i bring you sweet honey ... ... from the bees and tasty fruit?
i'm kidding , my chile .
also brought something for ... ... today's lunch , it's in the kitchen .
two broiled partridges .
partridges or herons?
holy mother .
those herons are birds from hell ... ... i've seen them flying over there .
why?
well .
you know they're the bad instincts of people?
yes .
when one's bad instincts start acting up .
the whole sky fills with herons , those ugly birds .
it's the mistress , let me hide quick .
first time she passes by here .
what is she looking for?
let me hide better , just in case .
what'd she say?
what'd she say?
nothing , she just stared at me .
and tossed that at me .
like a bone to a dog .
don't get it , dad .
she stared at her .
what if she jinxed her?
ldiot .
let's go home .
come .
this land wanted some good news .
and i'm here to tell it .
i crossed the altamira , i saw it again .
old man melesio .
the santos boy recognized you ...
as if twenty years hadn't passed .
here we are , antonio .
my outings pal when we were little .
we looked for beehives and nests .
i'm back for whatever expeditions are needed now .
well said , son .
sandovales stand with luzardos to fight .
gather round , luzardo team ... ... so the doctor can see you ... ... and knows who he can count on .
this is maria nieves , don't mind his name .
you'll see he's a real man alright .
you can count on us , doctor .
i'm telling you .
this one .
hold on , antonio .
let me introduce myself ... ... just in case , you never know .
juan palacio is my name .
call me bird like everyone else .
behind this hand is an open man .
from the wide plains , who ... ... gives himself openly on first sight .
you said it , and your word has weight .
the overseer , balbino paiba .
no sir .
carmelito lopez .
from the plains as well .
i don't swear allegiance right away .
nice to meet you .
listen to your first impression .
is paiba around?
no sir .
he was aware you were coming .
probably thinks his job's at risk ... ... since his accounting is iffy .
so he took off before being asked .
we'll talk about that later .
what do you think of him?
well .
i doubt he's what we need ... ... here to face up to ms. barbara .
well i do , carmelito .
he looks like a luzardo , real men all of them .
altamira isn't what it used to be .
a master's hand's been needed here for 20 years .
because of her .
the administrators have all been crooks .
not to mention the one that's the worst .
balbino paibas is great ... ... at taking what ain't his .
after only three months here ... ... he's taken lots of cattle to corrals at miedo .
there's still wild cattle in altamira .
and five of us here .
ready to do what's needed .
they say five fingers make a hand .
an invalid can do lots with a straight hand .
thanks , bird .
you've met your people , doc .
come to my place before you go to yours .
so you can meet my family .
will you?
sure , let's go .
why did you hide from me?
where , ma'am?
you think i can't see?
you were with marisela .
you think i don't that ... ... you give her food every day?
if it weren't for that .
what would she do?
would've starved long ago .
is it wrong to give her some leftovers from here?
behind my back , yes .
i won't do it again ma'am .
whatever you gave to marisela ... ... wrapped in a handkerchief ... ... she didn't take it .
no?
i brought it back .
give it to the dogs .
ma'am .
have you ever seen dogs eat silver?
it's actually gold .
you don't say , ma'am .
let me feel it at least before you take it .
get out .
all right ma'am .
hi , juan primito .
hi , mr. balbino .
careful , folks are nervous today .
surely not due to me .
today was okay .
wasn't it?
what was that?
today was an okay day .
eighty head from altamira ... ... that we'll brand as miedo cattle .
i'll brand them .
because you , mr. balbino ... ... will be busy in altamira .
giving your report to doctor luzardo .
you know the captain's cigarettes?
smoke your brand .
i ran out , neighbor .
then keep them all .
juan primito was right .
folks are nervous around here .
he didn't explain why , but as to fighting ... ... if that's why doctor luzardo came ... ... we'll beat him in no time flat .
i think dr. luzardo came to review ... ... how well you're managing altamira .
one may not see what one will trip on .
what's the matter , neighbor?
you know i was in altamira ... ... to render my services to you .
thanks to my recommendation ... ... luzardo trusted you as overseer .
he never even saw you .
true enough .
but haven't my services ... ... compensated your favor to me?
i really can't complain .
so why the attitude?
mr. balbino .
they're expecting you at altamira .
let them wait .
my place is right here .
this is all i care about .
it's high time we formalize situations ... ... that are not well defined .
ours , for instance .
ours?
yes .
people are wondering if we do or don't .
so we'd best show them ... ... before god and men alike ... ... that we do .
you forget , balbino paibas ... ... that i use men at my convenience .
i spit them out when i'm done .
do it once again .
i trust you .
excuse me .
come in , melquiades .
did the horses arrive well?
yes , ma'am .
and i brought their full value .
in gold ounces as requested .
we heard you came to palo de agua .
in the boat with doctor luzardo .
is that so , melquiades?
make sure it's all there .
it must be , you're never wrong .
you don't have that bad habit .
i assume it's to pick up on the gossip around .
and since i like to know , too .
do you want to ask me something?
in a minute .
after mr. balbino has left .
good afternoon .
lots of talk aboard the boat?
some , not all of it important .
lots of fancy words , though .
that doc sure does talk pretty .
and what is he like?
he's a good looking man .
i have a picture of him , in fact .
from the san fernando news .
says he's back on the plains .
here it is , in the paper .
i brung it for you to see him .
he looks the same in person .
just in case you run into him .
you know how life is .
he really is good looking .
do you have any other questions?
no , you can go .
good night .
he's talking in the picture .
like i said , he does talk pretty .
carmelito , why are you leaving?
i'm a good judge of character .
dr. luzardo , with due respect ... ... doesn't look like what we need ... ... to set things straight here .
give the man some time .
if it turns out i'm wrong , then ... ... i'll leave altamira with you .
do it for a friend who ... ... has never betrayed your trust .
mr. balbino .
no one raises his voice at me .
mr. balbino , i'll do what needs doing .
say the word and i'm ready .
what is it?
this horse is mine .
i gave no order to saddle it .
we think it belongs to dr. luzardo .
he owns everything in altamira .
venancio is taming it for him .
on your orders?
yes .
are you overseer of altamira?
not quite .
as long as i am ...
i represent the master's authority .
but you're not any longer .
but ...
at least ...
i haven't given you numbers .
don't bother .
i can imagine what you'll say .
i always assume the ... ... consequences of my mistakes ... ... so keep what you took and get out .
but ...
there are no buts .
i think we're done talking .
doctor luzardo , you've offended me .
and you've robbed me .
well , fellas .
that one's saddled and ready to go .
everything's ready .
when you were still a kid ... ... no one had to tame your horses for you .
right , antonio .
wait venancio , i'll do it .
this one ain't quite tame yet .
don't worry .
let go .
move aside , maria nieves .
watch how it's done , carmelito .
watch the eyes , venancio .
come on , hurry , doctor .
careful .
come on now .
what do you say about that?
i was raised with the man .
santos luzardo .
i came to offer friendship .
your friendship .
not between barqueros and luzardos .
too much blood has run on both sides .
i don't want it to continue .
well i do , i want it to .
what's this?
won't you defend yourself?
are your hands enough for you?
well for me , too .
hold it .
a luzardo in a barquero's house .
and both are still alive .
you were the family's hope at one time .
lorenzo , the intelligent one with promise .
i admired you when we were kids .
santos luzardo .
the lorenzo barquero of today has ... ... nothing in common with the one you recall .
say you haven't seen him again .
that he no longer exists .
this land won't let it go .
it surrounds you and affects you .
it crushes your will .
the hope of the family .
my great intelligence .
not true .
truth is what you're seeing .
what i've become .
see yourself in me , santos .
you've come , too .
you heard the call of the man eater , too .
lorencito .
lorencito .
i didn't know lorenzo had company .
my name is guillermo .
i was about to tell you my name too .
but i can see you have no interest .
here , give me that .
wait , lorencito .
i need this whisky to help me hunt tigers .
while tigers appear .
give it to me .
ready for the business i proposed?
give it to me .
you mean , done deal .
you're a witness , doctor luzardo .
mr. guillermo paid me in advance ... ... for a deal struck with lorenzo barquero .
of legal age and domiciled here , as they say .
what's this about?
i don't need to satisfy your curiosity .
then why compromise my witnessing it?
oh , bad , bad .
the dr. doesn't want mr. guillermo's friendship .
all right .
bye lorencito , remember .
it's a done deal .
what did you do?
santos luzardo .
you admired him as a child .
he's done the worse thing a man could do .
this is the price of my daughter .
are you marisela?
pretty name , ugly face .
crooked mouth and cross eyed .
me , cross eyed?
guess i heard wrong .
not cross eyed , mouth is fine , but ugly , yes .
unless i didn't see straight .
let me see you again to be sure .
come .
you are beautiful , girl .
even more so now .
you should care for yourself better .
let me go .
don't get angry .
don't bet what?
angry , as in don't get mad .
get mean .
that's it .
so why dintcha say so then?
get angry .
you have a knack for learning .
teaching you is an investment .
who says you can be my teacher?
santos luzardo , your dad's cousin .
i knew it .
come .
where?
to the water .
it cleans and beautifies .
i won't bathe in front of you !
no , just wash your face .
is it sunday?
come on , you mountain cub .
see the sky reflected in the water .
this will be a transcendental moment .
a solemn rite which i'll officiate as priest .
on your knees .
that's it .
learn from the water .
it knows how to stay clean amid the swamp mud .
clear waters that touch the sky .
that's a song .
do you know it?
sing it to me another day or you'll cry .
me , cry?
yes , you .
you're so dumb .
quiet down , you'll be happy ... ... when you see yourself in a mirror .
golly .
now we can call you ... ... marisela , with the pretty name and face .
song of the harp of the plain .
where the skies look upon each other .
okay , go now .
all right , but i'll come back for you .
you'll live in altamira with me , see you later .
good day .
'day .
go on , say it .
santos luzardo , man .
fancy seeing you here .
don't you recognize me?
frankly .
freshman law at the university .
mujiquita , man .
oh , mujiquita .
remember those days , santos luzardo?
roman law , canonical law , sociology .
you swore you weren't made for law .
you never did your homework .
i didn't eat well .
i had to accept not being a doctor .
well , you're not missing too much .
in this country , doctors ... ... serve ministers and generals .
i serve a colonel .
i call him general to make him happy .
now you can say you're a doctor .
oh , santos luzardo .
have a seat , man .
what are you here for?
to ask the authorities ... ... to call ms. barbara and mr. guillermo ... ... my neighbors of altamira .
i need them to comply with ... ... certain legal prescriptions .
do you know who she is , ms. barbara?
of course i do .
she seems to be above the law ... ... but i'll make her obey it .
the civil authority , colonel bernalete ... ... is out of town today .
of course i can issue subpoenas .
like other times .
are you scared this time?
actually , no .
sure looked like it to me .
take over .
i'm risking my livelihood for you .
to appear in this office after so much time .
bernalete must be crazy .
i received a subpoena , too .
at the request of the interested party .
santos luzardo , of course .
santos luzardo wants to fight .
worried?
pleased .
i needed a good fight .
and by the way .
you know that dr. luzardo took ... ... lorenzo barquero and marisela to live at altamira .
i heard .
let's go .
honoring that subpoena?
and why not?
i'll face santos luzardo soon .
he'll see my capabilities .
i didn't plan on going .
but i'll gladly join a good fight .
given what was splained
explained .
it's all been proved .
everything has been cleared .
what's going on?
i didn't say that word you just recorded?
you said explained , proved and cleared .
it was a lot of 'eds .
too many of them .
what do you care?
avoiding cacophony , general .
cacophony .
it's impolite to correct me .
take it off , young mujica .
don't end up losing something else .
no , no general .
as you wish .
that's right , as i wish .
it is now clear .
the iron used on the steer .
hold on .
how did you spell iron?
with an " e " , general .
i knew you'd put an " e " in there .
dot the " i " so it sounds like i say it .
done , general .
that " e " is actually an absurd letter .
because it has no sound .
it wasn't used in old castilian .
people said ir'n and not iron .
gorge's , not gorgeous .
wait , mujiquita .
don't tell me i speak old castilian .
nor new castilian .
the general jokes .
i joke .
let's get to the real business .
you don't fool me , mujiquita .
you're forgetting something .
and so you're nervous .
true , general , i forgot .
this morning ... ... dr. santos luzardo came by .
to subpoena ms. barbara and mr. guillermo .
did you say ms. barbara?
and you complied?
yes general , it seemed
so , it seemed to you .
so you dare actually usurp my duties .
you were out of town .
still , you should've respected ... ... the instrument of my authority .
but subpoenas ... ... i've done before with your approval .
but this is about ms. barbara , dummy .
out of my way , mujiquita .
what a surprise .
hello .
what's new with mr. guillermo?
you made us come racing over here .
from such a distance .
you don't say?
it's been a real calamity .
i'll explain it to you .
the subpoena requestor should be here soon .
and he'll end up learning a lesson .
eight days arrest with his accomplice .
so they learn to respect those i esteem .
please have a seat .
good afternoon .
how can i help you?
i've asked these people to appear .
you've asked or begged them?
i've asked .
as is my right by law .
then be brief .
no need to ask for that .
first the gentleman .
if the lady doesn't mind .
don't worry dr. luzardo .
for the last shall be the first .
you say you own certain lands .
i say?
my title deeds are duly registered .
purchased from mr. lorenzo barquero .
very well .
i'm not challenging such purchases .
but according to the deeds ... ... you do not possess the minimum required ... ... by law to round up cattle ... ... and brand it as your own .
can you prove what you say?
certainly .
my intent is to make you ... ... obey the law , by paying ... ... to have your property fenced .
tell me , dr. luzardo .
what role do i play in this?
you're the authority hearing my case .
mr. mujica .
bring the law book .
don't bother colonel .
dr. luzardo is right .
mr. guillermo must fence in his land .
oh , gosh .
if you say so .
why , colonel?
because that's ms. barbara's law , too .
you heard , dr. luzardo .
maybe your legislators forgot something ... ... that could be applicable .
like the obligation to contribute to the cost ... ... of the fence between altamira and miedo .
i see you know how to meet a challenge .
or as we say here .
use one's horse to reign in cattle .
mr. mujica .
yes , general .
take note of the agreement .
ms. barbara disagrees with ...
excuse me , colonel .
i'll do as dr. luzardo asks .
it's his right .
and mr. guillermo .
will i'm sure obey the law too .
fencing in his small plot .
which are just small breeding savannas .
so rules the law of the plains .
right , doctor luzardo?
yes ma'am .
comments , mr. guillermo?
i think i'll hunt tigers elsewhere .
where you won't need to obey the laws?
oh , mr. guillermo .
good afternoon .
good bye colonel bernalete .
since when do you treat me that way?
'bye , colonel .
mr. mujica .
you are hereby relieved of your position .
look , dad .
he brought me this ... ... so i can make pretty dresses , too .
look , this one's pretty .
so is this one .
aren't you listening?
mosey on over here .
mosey?
you don't say mosey .
say come over here .
i know , i said it on propose .
on purpose .
it's not time for lessons .
i'll always teach you to talk right .
what's wrong with you?
he been that way since you left .
lips sealed shut .
scold him .
he been or he's been?
i'll have to keep my shut my mouth too .
my corrections bother you?
no .
causes me pain .
pain or shame?
pain is suffering , and i don't want that .
i forgot to thank you for this gift .
why do you laugh?
your feeling ashamed .
you said that to goad me .
cheer up , man .
you going to sit forever?
take notice .
he has to go from hating to being grateful .
call it liking and it won't be as bad .
juan primito .
juan primito .
yes , ma'am .
throw that away .
holy mother , a broken mirror .
that means bad luck .
idiot .
is that dr. luzardo's picture?
good looking man .
i done seen him yesterday like in the paper .
what will you do with that?
what's it to you?
go on .
i see you with my two eyes .
may yours be blind without them .
your judgment and pride .
between the saints 'backs .
so their grace can't reach you .
i shine light on you .
with the light of the father .
with the light of the son .
and of the holy spirit .
man .
me seeing you like this .
tame and humble .
like christ before pilate .
three lights of evil are lit .
one for lucifer , one for satan , and one for beelzebub .
to light man's way through perdition .
what can you say about your ... ... accomplishments in these parts?
i haven't done much , actually .
one guy lost his money because ... ... he slept close to me , a sleepwalker .
gosh .
has he woken up yet?
i think so .
i said i ain't done much yet .
well get with it , pal .
here at miedo ... ... men are backed by crosses ... ... that they created .
right , melquiades?
don't get me involved .
they call him scary here .
he's killed seven men .
let it be known .
it was their doing .
i just gave them the spear .
they did the rest themselves .
throwing themselves to the hilt .
herons at night , juan primito?
those are the worst .
see how they cover the whole sky .
what are herons?
rare birds that juan primito sees .
at night .
he's not as dumb as he looks .
they're the lady's bad instincts .
you'll see .
what do the herons want , juan primito?
honey and vinegar .
honey of love and vinegar of bad intent for the christian .
gosh .
who is that christian?
i don't know .
but herons fly towards altamira .
is it doctor luzardo?
who knows .
holy mother .
i bet she's putting honey and vinegar .... ... on those herons so they get fed up .
and leave the christian alone .
juan primito must've seen something .
drink .
drink , you damned herons .
drink honey and vinegar , so you leave the christian alone .
i am a lark nesting over a lake .
and although i live over calm water , i am always awake
to think that it is so distant .
water , you are so close .
you're so close , and i'm so far .
very nice .
oh , you were there .
i was hearing you sing , you're not that bad .
i'm not that good at anything , i know it .
hey there .
hi .
look at what i found .
again .
what i found looking around .
don't you like it for the living room?
it isn't exactly pretty .
i'll say .
i knew you'd find something wrong with it .
wait , you didn't let me finish .
it isn't your fault that it's not artistic .
but , i like the idea of putting it on the table .
so , you see , i'm not so dumb after all .
i never thought so , quite the contrary .
i've always said you're an intelligent girl , haven't l?
yes , you've said that enough .
that's all you say to me .
what more do you want?
ha , what more could i want?
ha again?
yes , ha .
don't get upset .
i'm keeping score , you say it less and less every day .
it's the first you miss .
doptor luzardo .
there's no fine beast for miss marisela to ride .
i broke in this mare , and brought her as a gift .
if you'll allow me .
certainly , carmelito .
thank you very much , carmelito .
so you broke her in for me .
would you like to try her out?
see how she behaves with you?
now?
i don't have any riding gear .
you don't?
are you sure?
go take a look .
we're not so bad at breaking them in , are we?
i understand what you are trying to say .
but i think ... ... that a positive person ... ... should move in positive ways .
am i clear?
perhaps too clear .
i have a perfectly clear idea on my mind .
and only this do i put into words .
you need ... ... doctor luzardo ... ... to fall under your control and obey your will .
it's true , and it will happen , don't you worry .
marisela at doctor luzardo's house ... ... gets in the way of your plans .
under the laws of this country ... ... your hold complete parental authority over marisela .
lsn't that so?
it is .
what if you use that authority ... ... and claim the girl as your daughter ... ... and take her home with you?
and then?
then , i will immediately take marisela for myself .
in matrimony .
i have no objection .
of course .
you would then be my son in law .
in other ways , my heir .
i didn't go that far .
you are a positive person , mr. guillermo .
say what you shall .
but i have my own ways .
as far as my plans are concerned , don't you worry .
may i accompany you?
no , thank you .
will you do things your way?
yes .
good luck , ms. barbara .
don't trust your supernatural ways too much .
be wary of the mirages of the savanna .
it was just over here .
the famous house of macaniyal after the last change .
the deeds used it as a reference for the border ... ... between altamira and el miedo .
the house has functioned thanks to ms. barbara .
altamira has been within it .
but this time , the change was backwards .
change .
they took it apart and didn't rebuild it because of this .
could this be a trap they set ... ... for when you put the fence up?
maybe .
look .
good morning , doctor luzardo .
good morning , ma'am .
are you getting ready to set up the fence?
no ma'am , i'll let you know in due time .
well .
i'm taking this opportunity to ... .... offer to gather my livestock wandering in the savanna .
and i hope you allow me ...
it's not my custom to do that ... ... outside of the legal cowboy season .
but , since it is you , doctor luzardo ...
to please you , tell me when and where you want to begin .
day after tomorrow , dark meadow .
will you go?
yes , ma'am .
so will l .
see you then , doctor luzardo .
good bye , ma'am .
come on , marisela .
beware , ms. barbara .
of the mirages of the savanna .
wind storms .
the wind makes them at destroys them .
they're gone .
yes , they're distroyed .
destroyed .
teaching , so early?
no , there is no lesson today .
tonight there is song , dance and poems .
fiesta in altamira .
dancing , fun , fiestas .
how nice .
i shall sing it today , folks , it is special .
the music is my partner's , the lyrics are mine .
the bud of altamira , marisela , will be replying .
play the harp , buddy .
marisela , pretty girl .
the harp plays a tune , soft bouquet not to be pruned that perfumes the sweetness of womb
marisela , you pretty girl .
the harp plays a tune , bouquet not to be pruned .
the harp plays a tune , soft bouquet not to be pruned . that perfumes the sweetness of womb .
maraca man , sing of my land of my simple people in pain .
they work , love and wait singing in tune not ever in vane .
they love and wait .
your music is their fate .
nice song .
i wonder who wrote it .
marisela , you're a song born from the harp of this land torn
the savanna hears you doze , the savanna dreams of your pose .
marisela , you're a song born from the harp of this land torn
the savanna hears you doze , the savanna dreams of your pose .
maraca man , sing of my land here is your verse that i demand .
i learned it just after i slept , as i saw the savanna and i wept
as i saw my beloved plain .
tell us , what did he say?
nothing , not a word .
we all saw the way he spoke as you danced .
he whispered in your ear .
nothing special .
come on .
really , really .
tell us , tell us .
here he comes , go away .
what are you doing?
remembering the lesson i wanted to forget .
the grammatical sentence is composed .
why do you laugh?
it's nothing .
then , you must be mad .
they say that the moon on the plain takes your sanity .
who knows , i myself am sane .
are you sure?
what a pretty night , isn't it?
beautiful .
and the song was very pretty , wasn't it?
sure was .
did he compose it?
who else could have?
i thought maybe ... ... somebody else had .
since they were about me .
really?
about you?
how unpleasant .
nice night , huh?
you , still here?
do you mind if i look after you?
mr. balbino's time has come .
you have no knowledge , my friend ... ... of those who were peons when they fell asleep ... ... and woke up as butlers .
or vice versa .
such pretty women's clothes hadn't been seen here for a while .
neither had we seen that the line between el miedo ... ... moved backwards like it is doing now .
doptor luzardo better take care .
this card has been dealt .
juan says he has been dazzled .
there is no power to fight that .
my messenger , where is he?
he's over by the bush .
i seen him over there .
thanks , pal , i found them .
you must behave yourself , lucero .
hurry boys , it's almost sun up .
it's an hour to mata oscura .
we have to arrive first .
we're ready .
are you prepared?
they may not be so wild .
but we may have to break some in .
i'm taking a good rope they won't resist .
for the others , just in case .
here is " fire spitter " , who is used ... ... to putting the bullet where he sets his eye .
when his hand isn't shaking .
shut your trap , pigeon toes .
maria nieves knows that nothing makes me tremble .
i give quinine a fever .
an whoever tries to take me on , learns a lesson .
let's go , you swindler .
hurry , the doptor's on his way .
we're ready .
hello , good morning .
up so early?
i didn't sleep all night .
we have to talk today .
right now .
we're talking .
i can't go on , santos luzardo .
it's useless to ask me to regenerate .
it's ridiculous .
it's stupid .
don't get upset , man .
i've decided to go home .
to go back to what i was .
to what i am .
fine .
your determinations coincide ... ... with my own tonight .
marisela cannot stay here .
she must be taken to the capital ... ... to a boarding school where she will get .... ... the education she needs .
to a school?
how will i pay the tuition?
that's on me .
i will take her to caracas if you authorize it .
but since i cannot leave altamira for now ... ... you must sacrifice yourself ... ... and stay here until i can .
fine .
what you do with yourself is your business .
resting , doctor luzardo?
yes , ma'am .
refreshment?
thank you .
are you happy?
it was a great day for you .
i am satisfied , that is true .
did you forget the regional skills?
good rider , sure roper .
that is not surprising in a man .
much less for you who can rope ... ... and defeat a bull better than anyone .
a skill not admired in a woman , right?
would you like to discuss ... ... the livestock?
our men are on the subject .
meanwhile , we can chat like friendly neighbors .
we have something to tell each other , doctor luzardo .
actually , i've been meaning to talk to you .
about someone in particular?
well , yes .
about somebody .
i know what you want to say .
that i've taken marisela's inheritance away .
that i've forsaken her by ruining lorenzo barquero .
that she goes hungry and wears rags .
i was hungry and wore rags once .
and i was younger than marisela is now .
brutal men found satiation in me .
is it so far fetched ... ... that i have meant to make other people pay ... ... for the ill done to me?
have you ever thought , i dare inquire ... ... of the harm you have inflicted ... ... upon yourself with that vendetta?
the violence endured ... ... never justifies the violence applied .
continue , doctor luzardo .
i like to listen to you .
i had been told you were a pleasure to hear .
i wish i could believe you .
do .
and believe this , doctor luzardo .
had i come across you before , the story ... ... of my life would be different .
i'm expected .
excuse me .
he cannot carry the rope anymore .
thanks for making me laugh , child .
you'll be around .
miss " is written with m .
have you thought of the harm inflicted upon yourself?
you are so quiet .
and you didn't even lose the day .
no .
we herded over 1 00 cattle here .
who knows what was left at mata oscura .
long conversation with the mistress?
quite so .
but not only that .
there is silence from that side .
silence .
who knows what she's thinking .
don't worry , partner .
with men like doptor luzardo ... ... we don't run such danger .
boys , have you heard how things are bartered?
he who owned a car yesterday , today owns a coach and martyr .
he who owned a car yesterday , today owns a coach and martyr .
well , winter is upon us .
announced by the herons ... ... who arrived earlier on .
doctor luzardo cannot complain .
the herons have behaved this year .
we must have a good deal of feathers by now .
they are priced mighty high ... ... so they'll give good money .
you will take them to san fernando .
get ready to leave tomorrow .
take your brother along with you .
like the doptor says .
and buy the wire we need for the fence .
the fence .
yes , boy .
the starting point nowadays ... ... of progress and civilization for the plains .
as long as each property is not fenced on ... ... nobody will begin improving the breeding ... ... nor respecting the rights of others .
rights , laws .
here the law is armed aggression .
hands tainted with blood .
do you think ms. barbara will ... ... respect your fence if you're not willing to kill?
come on , man .
i understand your reaction ... ... after being disabled .
but not to that extreme .
santos luzardo .
do not lose sense of reality .
there are only two ways here .
to kill , or to give in .
if you don't want your rights tramples on .
don't be appalled at the murderer's red glory .
juan pimito .
my little one .
you are so pretty .
let me see you all cleaned up and with your hair combed .
and , wearing shoes .
my , you've put on weight .
i can tell you're eating proper meals now .
but you are all dirty and ... ... wearing the same clothes .
aren't you ashamed?
and go around clean , girl?
what for?
nobody has to like me .
you have become dirty minded , juan primito .
what did you bring me?
wild bee honeycomb .
a little taste of honey ... ... for your delicious mouth .
my chile .
why hadn't you come?
don't say that .
the animals have been excited .
i don't have ... ... time to do anything .
really?
just imagine , my dearest child .
blessed mary .
there is a picture between candles ... ... with the three lights for evil ways that lead ... ... down the road with no end .
a picture?
of who?
of doptor luzardo , and he's upside down .
did he give it to her?
i don't know , but it's surrounded by candles , it is .
there is evil there , my child .
there is evil there?
the man is upside down .
to make him weak before the woman .
like christ before pilates .
why don't you take it and put out the candles?
me?
those candles can be put out ... ... only by the person who lit them .
otherwise , fates would be distorted .
and whoever puts them out ... ... will remain in the dark forever .
you fool .
where are those candles?
in her room .
is she there?
who knows .
she said she was going to town .
she may be gone by now .
saddle catira up .
the white mare in the corral .
what will you do , chile?
i'm going over there .
holy mother of god .
what if doptor luzardo sees us?
he isn't here .
come on , let's go .
santos luzardo .
it had to be .
yes , partner .
that's a lost man .
come in , doptor luzaldo
sit down , ms. barbara will be right with you .
thank you .
welcome , doctor luzardo .
good morning , ma'am .
i finally have the pleasure of seeing you in my home .
i've come , for i am beginning ... ... to build the fence that will divide our properties .
in view of the fact that ... ... once again ... ... there were overnight changes ...
yes , sir .
things went back to where they began .
the fence dividing our lands ... ... is where it once was .
you have decided to give up illegally ... ... that which you won over me judicially .
why not?
it is never too late to repair the damage done ... ... to oneself by evil deeds .
you said it yourself , doctor luzardo .
i quote you in good faith .
madam .
i have no right to doubt your possible sincerity .
but the restitution you intend ... ... by changing the fence ... ... is obviously illegal .
we shall legalize it in an adequate document ... ... which i am prepared to let you write yourself .
i am giving back part of the savanna to you to win over ... ... your friendship , which is more valuable to me .
thank you , ma'am .
but , now that you're in the mood for restitution and repair ... ... i advise you to do other things ... ... which are fair and more humane .
restore the property to your daughter marisela .
man .
now that you mention her ... ... i was forgetting to congratulate you , dr. luzardo .
the girl is absolutely dashing ... ... ever since she has been living with you .
ma'am .
you have been so bold as to destroy in a moment ... ... the trust that i may have been ... ... placing in your intentions .
marisela does not live with me ... ... in the dirty sense you imply .
she's at my house under my protection .
she has no bread , while her mother has it all .
all except what i foolishly came to ask of you .
noble feelings .
pretend we never spoke , about this or anything else .
oh heavens , partner .
the mistress 'witchcraft isn't working .
or could it be that you are countering it?
which room is hers?
the first on the left , but she probably locked it .
we'll see , wait here .
chiled of mine .
three divine people , bring her out safely .
what are you doing here?
what do you want?
that picture .
do you really want it so badly?
yes , give it to me .
are you in love with him?
yes .
that man belongs to me .
you're lying , you witch .
let me go , witch .
let me go .
let her go .
santos .
don't worry about witchcraft .
you can go on with it .
things go back to where they began .
to where they began .
do rivers return to their source?
those are your words .
my words .
she's talking to the partner , holy mother of god .
my words .
does the lost soul return to the crossroads where he strayed?
if you want him to come to you ... ... you must surrender your evil deeds .
what is wrong with me , what am i doing?
i stumble over my own feet , i simply cannot find myself .
what's wrong?
i wish i would die , i wish i would die .
why?
i am the evil woman's daughter .
why did you do that , father?
daughter .
with so many women in the world ... ... why , oh why did you choose that mother?
what were you searching for?
alcohol , alcohol .
to start over again .
no .
to put an end to it once and for all .
doctor , doctor luzardo .
what is it?
bad news , doctor .
a messenger from town brought them .
on behalf of a colonel with carmelito's horse .
carmelito's?
they found him dead in a grove ... ... near totuma's ranch .
no sign of the feathers .
he was murdered .
saddle the horse , i'm going to town .
to the palm grove?
santos is leaving for town .
prepare your things .
we'll leave right after him .
i'm with you , boy .
i hear you were close to him .
two men have been murdered .
murdered?
carmelito lpez and his brother manuel .
they were taking sacks of feathers to san fernando .
what's up , santos?
we thought it was a case of natural death ... ... because only one body was found ... ... and there were no signs of violence .
did you take the body away?
yes , in my duties as judge .
with general bernalete .
he must be at his home .
let me go talk to him .
talk to him?
in your duties as judge?
heavens , santos .
don't you know where we live?
because i gave you that citation ... ... i lost my post as secretary .
i owe it to the general that i'm a judge now .
i'm going to see him .
how long will you be unhappy , mujiquita?
until , you know , such is life .
the hands of justice .
i am here , making a living .
five children , you must realize .
here comes the general .
you're right on time , doptor luzardo .
let's see .
what can you tell us about a peon of yours ... ... found dead at totuma's grove?
what can i tell you ... ... or is it a formal statement?
yes , sir .
a single answer for your two headed question .
doctor luzardo already told me that carmelito lpez ... ... the deceased , was with his brother manuel ... ... taking two sacks of heron feathers .
so , now the truth comes up .
doctor luzardo , you suspect ... ... that this manuel character ... ... killed this carmelito character to steal the feathers .
not at all .
i suspect they were both murdered .
i hope you investigate in that direction .
i state it before the judge , who is the competent authority .
take note , honorable judge , of the witness's statement ... ... when questioned by competent authority .
may i remind you that i am here , doptor luzardo .
make no mistake .
you're the one making the mistake , colonel bernalete .
does doctor luzardo have anything more to say?
that's all , for now .
i get the feeling that i'm going to ... ... imprison the doctor for several days ... ... to teach him to respect authority .
step in his shoes , general .
two sacks of feathers at today's price .
a considerable amount of money .
but he has supplied us with the clue out of this maze .
that manuel character .
will you order the investigation?
when will you ever stop ... ... being such a dunce , mujiquita?
you'll be buried in a white urn , you're so naive .
if we do a real investigation ... ... we are going to run into ... ... ms. barbara herself .
we've got to forget this thing .
bury the dead .
but , what's the cause of death?
you're not aware that carmelito was murdered?
murdered .
i heard he died a natural death .
isn't a stab in the back or a bullet wound ... ... natural death in these parts?
his brother manuel , who was transporting the feathers ... ... to san fernando with him , is a suspect .
could it truly have been his own brother?
two sacks of feathers are worth a lot of money .
that is true .
poor doctor luzardo .
he had his hopes set on that feather harvest ... ... to build a fence around altamira .
he can wait until next year .
did manuel take the feathers?
who knows .
no .
those feathers must be hidden somewhere .
i'll ask the partner tonight .
don't you know i have a ghostly partner ... ... who reveals to me everything of my interest?
and , by the way ... ... i'm going to ask him what you've been up to ... ... the past few days you were gone .
do you have a new sweetheart?
i'm going to get jealous .
no , i just wasn't welcome in these parts .
after i've been on my good behavior .
you were at totuma's grove .
what are you saying?
i'm going to find out where those feathers are .
at least one of those sacks of feathers is mine .
yes , madam .
follow him , i want to know what he does .
killing time?
in light of lack of food .
that is , as long as there's no work .
there is a job at mata oscura .
the road to altamira passes by there .
doctor luzardo takes it on his way back .
i must talk to him today .
wait for him there and bring him .
what if he doesn't want to come?
by his own feet .
do as i say .
that i shall .
stop kidding yourself , mr. balbino .
i am not a child .
you didn't come to offer me cattle or horses .
you want to sell feathers .
feathers?
are you insane , mr. guillermo?
selling feathers is dangerous business right now .
that depends .
but ...
tell me something .
what?
have you passed by totuma's grove lately?
not exactly by the grove , no .
i've passed nearby on my way to san fernando .
that's funny .
what?
i did .
the day after the body was found .
authorities in this country have no eyes , they cannot see .
i searched the grove and i found ...
what?
doesn't this belong to you?
what?
it has your initials on it .
yes , this is yours , mr. balbino .
leave your gun at your hip .
take your thing .
i wasn't planning on keeping it .
what do you intend?
i don't intend anything .
you came to make me a proposal .
let's cut the games , mr. guillermo .
right now .
let's get to the point .
you were right , i didn't come to offer cattle .
i came to offer feathers , two sacks 'worth .
first class .
i buried them at the foot of a tree .
if you pay up we can go get them right now .
they wouldn't be the first ... ... crooked feathers you buy .
you are mistaken , mr. balbino .
i don't do business that's not in my plans .
i ...
i was bored .
i just wanted to have a little fun .
you left that thing ... ... on my desk a long time ago .
i haven't been to totuma's grove .
it was all just a game .
a very dangerous game .
don't you realize , mr. guillermo?
not as dangerous as offering feathers .
but , fear not .
mr. guillermo doesn't speak .
not because your guns scares him ... ... but because mr. guillermo doesn't care ... ... what is stolen from dr. luzardo .
you understand?
the good name returns to the palm grove .
good times are over , catira .
you , back to your savanna ... ... and me , back to my ranch .
go on .
my buddy lorenzo barquero is back at your house .
let us celebrate the event ... ... with some delicious spirits .
right out of the bottle , there are no glasses .
oh no , boy .
downing it like that is like getting shot .
slowly is better .
father .
good name !
welcome to the arms of mr. guillermo .
oh , stop it .
let me go .
give me ...
let me go .
father .
father .
father .
you creeps , let me go .
father .
father .
daddy .
daddy .
father .
father .
father .
been waiting for you , doctor .
for me?
i was sent to fetch you , and i must take you with me .
dead or alive?
that is up to you .
it won't be alive .
well , then ...
the savanna mystery is over .
what were you doing here?
i came from altamira to tell you the news .
when i saw melquiades hiding in the bush ... ... and since i know what line of work he's in ... ... i went around and hid to watch him .
so you see my suspicions were right .
is he dead?
dead as a rock , doctor .
what will we do with him?
don't be appalled ... ... at the murderer's red glory .
when did this happen?
this afternoon .
we had just returned from altamira .
why did you come back?
i think i know .
i would feel like dying , too .
what will become of me now?
of you?
are you alone?
i need you , too .
you were right , lorenzo barquero .
your advice was accomplished .
the red glory of murderers is now mine , too .
i have killed a man .
my hands are tainted with blood .
what do you say?
no , it cannot be .
yes .
me , too .
i just killed melquiades .
melquiades .
i had to do it .
we panicked ...
what happened?
melquiades .
it was melquiades .
it's him .
is he wounded?
where is he wounded?
on his temple .
it was a good shot ... ... but the shooter was not face to face with him .
he hunted him down ... ... or was beside him .
that's right .
that's good , too .
where is balbino paiba?
at totuma .
at the foot of a tree ... ... you will find dr. luzardo's stolen feathers .
balbino must be digging them up .
get over there quickly and bring him to me .
dead or alive .
what should we do with him?
take him home .
we're going after mr. balbino .
who's going?
who's there?
hands up !
don't move , mr. balbino .
don't move .
good evening , ms. barbara .
great things happened today .
things are starting to go the right way .
really?
as i arrived i was told ... ... that melquiades was killed ... ... and i just heard the confession by the murderer .
doctor luzardo .
how about that?
i think you are mistaken , mr. guillermo .
it wasn't doctor luzardo .
oh , really .
i heard it from his own mouth .
but ... ... i must have told you before ... ... that my friend lorenzo barquero ... ... is no longer with us , either .
did he finally die?
this afternoon .
at the palm grove .
shortly after he returned from altamira with marisela .
ah , they had returned to the grove .
am i not right in saying things are taking the right path?
once the father is dead ... ... parental authority over marisela ... ... is completely in your hands .
she is underage .
besides , doctor luzardo committed homicide .
that is not true .
it wasn't him but balbino paiba who killed melquiades .
but i heard doctor luzardo tell marisela .
marisela?
yes .
he is at her house at this very moment .
mr. guillermo ... ... you did not hear him make such a confession .
my , my .
i didn't dream it .
you didn't hear anything , is that clear?
melquiades never liked balbino paiba .
my work .
both murderers .
my work , delivered .
i don't quite understand what you are saying .
but ... ... what if balbino can prove it wasn't him?
he can't .
because he's also dead .
my peons spotted him ... ... digging up dr. luzardo's stolen feathers .
he tried to shoot and was killed .
other things happened that night .
but ...
are you going to save luzardo ... ... when you could get rid of him ... ... by simply leaving him to his own means?
yes .
i have inflicted enough harm upon myself with violence .
i want to take another road .
deliver my deeds .
return things to where they began .
start over again .
i think i get the picture .
but ...
it's late , ms. barbara .
it's much too late to start over .
you are wrong , mr. guillermo .
i still have my life ahead of me .
a lot ...
and it's all mine .
all yours .
yes , ma'am .
unless such a young and beautiful woman ... ... were to cross your path right now .
but ...
that is nonsense .
ms. barbara is no longer ms. barbara .
i only came to notify you ... ... that lorenzo barquero is dead ... ... and that doctor luzardo is with marisela ... ... at the house in the palm grove .
having said that ... ... mr. guillermo puts his rifle on his shoulder ... ... and bids farewell to this world .
good bye , ms. barbara .
unless such a young and beautiful woman ... ... were to cross your path right now .
juan primito .
yes , ma'am?
my horse .
yes , ma'am .
where are you going?
only god knows .
mr. guillermo is right .
they will turn us all in roped together .
that's what i think , too .
well , if that's the case ... ... iet's saddle up before he returns .
because if the late balbino ... ... is blamed for melquiades 'death ... ... they will blame us for his .
the way things are right now ... ... there is no doubt about that .
well , let's saddle up .
let's go , boys .
madam .
they're all gone .
all of them .
what about you?
what are you waiting for?
i'll be damned .
what do they want now?
the news runs from mouth to mouth .
the devourer of men is gone .
the ranch of fear no longer exists ... ... and all is back to normal at altamira .
the wide , open land .
all horizon , much like hope .
all roads , much like will .
