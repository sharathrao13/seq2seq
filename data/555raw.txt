the sun does not cause lightning .
i'm telling you what that guy said .
i understand , but it just sounds dumb when you say ...

no , this is something else .
what's that sound?
i've never heard that before !
is it them?
is it them?
we gotta go .
where do we go? !
robbie , this is your house .
where do we go? !
no , no , no , wait !
are we still alive?
down here .
were you on this plane?
are you ...?
are you a passenger?
how you doing?
wanna help me open this?
are you a passenger?
he's deaf .
the shell went off right beside him .
camera on his shoulder saved his life .
you hear that , max?
your stupid camera saved your stupid life .
where were you?
out there in the pine barrens .
we were attached to a national guard unit .
the 83rd mechanized .
they moved on one of those things around midnight .
they got some kind of shield around them .
you can't see it , but everything we fire at them detonates too early , before we can get close enough to cause any damage .
when they flash that thing , everything lights up like hiroshima .
there's more than one?
you gotta be kidding me , right?
we were feeding new york , but new york went dark .
so we patched over to d. c. , they went down .
l. a. , chicago , uplinked to london .
even called the affiliates to try to get them to catch the feed , but nobody answers .
it's the same everywhere .
once the tripods start to move , no more news comes out of that area .
my god .
you ain't seen nothing yet .
i saw that storm .
i was right in the middle of one of those .
well , you didn't see it like this .
those machines come up from under the ground , right?
so that means they must've been buried here a long time ago .
so who's driving the goddamn things?
watch the lightning .
watch it .
watch the lightning .
keep watching the lightning .
what is that?
that is them .
they come down in capsules , riding the lightning into the ground , into the machines , right?
you hear that?
we're getting the hell out of here .
get in , get in , get in , get in .
hey , were you on that plane?
that's too bad .
it would've been a really great story .
look at me .
look at me .
you keep your eyes only on me , understand?
okay .
don't look down .
don't look around .
i'm taking you to the car .
you're gonna wanna look around .
but you're not going to .
are you?
no .
you're doing good .
you're doing good .
keep your eyes on me .
i'm going right to boston .
we're gonna see your mom .
i'm not gonna look , dad .
that's a girl .
that's my girl .
now listen .
i want you to close your eyes , okay?
okay .
got them closed?
there you go .
keep them closed for me .
okay .
robbie , get in .
robbie , get in !
why are you yelling?
it's okay .
get in .
why aren't we on the turnpike?
i don't want everybody to see that we've got a working car .
we'll stay along the hudson till we find an open bridge or ferry , then we're gonna cross the hudson .
we'll take the back roads across connecticut , all the way to boston .
where is everybody?
i don't know , running , hiding .
in their basements .
if we had balls , we'd go back
and find one of those things and kill it .
right .
yeah , good .
why don't you just let me make the big decisions .
which would be when?
never , ray?
never's about your speed .
stop it .
enough of the " ray " shit .
all right?
it's " dad , " " sir , " don't fight .
or if you want , " mr. ferrier .
that sounds a little weird to me , but you decide .
dad?
yes , rachel .
i've gotta go to the bathroom .
really?
i gotta go .
not so fast , not so fast , all right?
there's two things we gotta watch out for .
and the second is people who might want our car .
there's nobody around .
yeah .
i gotta go .
all right , rachel?
rachel , it's good right there .
i'm not going in front of you guys .
just go where i can see you .
are you crazy?
don't look !
i'm not gonna look .
just stay in sight !
that's looking !
okay , well , listen , every time you guys don't listen to me ,
i'm telling your mother , okay?
i'm making a list .
making a list .
i told you to stay where i could see you .
sorry .
i'm sorry .
stop !
stop !
wait !
stop !
let me on !
let me on !
give me a hand !
wait !
stop !
stop !
give me a hand !
kid , you're gonna get run over !
give me a hand !
you have room !
robbie !

there's nothing living in that direction , robbie .
what do you care?
you never gave a shit before .
you never gave a shit !
okay , hard ass , what's your plan , huh?
you're in charge now !
tell me what we're doing .
catch up with these soldiers !
hook up with whoever else isn't dead , and we get back at them .
we get back at them .
that's what we do .
let's try one that doesn't involve your 10 year old sister joining the army .
you have anything like that?
just tell us the truth .
wanna try that?
you have no idea which way to go .
you wanna come off all wise and shit !
you only chose boston because you hope mom is there .
and if she's there , you can dump us on her .
you can dump us on her , then you'll only have to care about yourself , which is exactly the way you like it .
robbie !
where are you trying to go?
what are you trying to do?
who's gonna take care of me if you go?
this is a test of the emergency alert system .
if this had been an actual emergency , official messages from federal , state or local authorities would've followed the alert tone .
this concludes the test of the emergency alert ...
i'll close my eyes .
why don't you drive for a bit .
i don't have a license .
since when has that stopped you?
ray .
ray !
dad !
ray !
dad !

i got it , but keep your foot on .
okay , i got it .
i got it .
where is everybody going?
i don't know , rach .
but we do , right?
yeah , we do .
why did he do that?
why is he doing that?
he wants a ride , rach .
everybody just wants a ride .
can we give him one?
sit back and put on your seat belt .
robbie , put on your seat belt .
put on your seat belt , rachel .
be careful .
how'd you fix this?
how'd you fix the car?

why won't you help us?
i'm sorry , i can't .
