sebastian ...
let's try and focus .
what can i say?
i'm a fool .
you're not a fool .
i am .
a poor little rich boy .
it's not your fault .
adolescence is a difficult time .
without great parenting , things can go awry .
but you have to rise above their mistakes .
here .
an autographed copy .
for me?
it's yours .
stop being so hard on yourself .
what's in the past is over .
you're right .
it's hard to believe there was a time when i only thought about sex .
it's no way to go through life .
take yourself , for example .
you're a very attractive woman .
you have killer legs .
i'd love to photograph them ...
that was the old me .
i'm cured now .
same time next week?
i'm going on my book tour .
i'll be back in a month .
why?
other people need my help , too .
you'll do just fine .
i hope so .
if you need anything , just call .
i could use a hug .
all right ...
there you go .
your daughter on 1 .
tell her to hold .
is this her?
she seems nice .
she's great .
straight a student .
she's attending princeton this fall .
she's the type of girl i should be with .
she's a little out of your league .
take care of yourself , sebastian .
thank you ... for everything .
shmuck .
yes?
your daughter's still holding .
hi , honey .
you kept me on hold .
he told me he loved me , and i believed him .
i'm so stupid .
it's all right .
take a deep breath , step out of the circle .
cut the psycho babble bullshit , mom !
there's pictures of me on the lnternet .
what kind of pictures?
nudie pictures !
what do you think?
how could you be so stupid?
he was just so charming .
he said i had killer legs ,
and he wanted to photograph them .
things just got completely out of hand .
mom ...
are you there?
mom?
mother !
sebastian !
you're going to pay for this , you little shit !
you sicko !
pervert !
what's her problem?
someone's in need of therapy .
you won't get away with this .
get away !
what's your name?
clorissa .
clorissa?
god , you're beautiful .
thank you .
i'm going to take you to lunch .
okay .
there's no parking here , sir .
we're so happy that cecile will be attending manchester with you .
you've been an inspiration to us .
we hope she can rise to the high standards you've set for her .
i'll do my best .
what was that?
" thanks . " isn't vietnamese lovely?
kathryn is very popular at school .
listen to her and you'll go far .
where do you get your strength?
it sounds corny , but ...
when i'm tempted by peer pressure , i turn to god .
he helps me .
that's beautiful .
what are the boys like?
cecile ...
is that all you can think of?
forgive her .
she's never been in a co educational atmosphere before .
it's understandable .
most boys at manchester are very upstanding .
but there are a few bad apples .
like your stepbrother sebastian .
what he did to the school nurse ...
i hear she's recovering quite well .
nice to see you again , mrs caldwell .
you remember my daughter cecile?
my , what an adorable shirt .
my father took me to australia .
how are things down under?
blossoming , i hope .
what?
i'm so sorry ...
well , thank you for your help .
i'll call about your curriculum .
okay , thanks .
it was nice meeting you .
let's go .
keep your legs together .
this isn't jamaica .
i didn't know it was asshole day .
i'm just taking the poor girl under my wing .
the parental units called .
how's your whore of a mother enjoying bali?
she suspects that your impotent , alcoholic dad is diddling the maid .
therapy not going well?
it was fine .
clorissa .
call me .
i'm sick of sleeping with these insipid manhattan debutantes .
nothing shocks them anymore .
relax .
i have a mission for you .
remember court reynolds?
the nazi who dumped you july 4th?
i went to great lengths to please court .
i made huge sacrifices .
my feelings were hurt when i learned court had fallen for someone else .
you don't mean ..?
none other than cecile caldwell .
so that's what this is all about .
keep your enemies close .
when i'm done with cecile , she'll be the premier tramp of new york .
court's princess will be damaged goods .
why not just attack court?
that could be traced back to me .
that won't do .
everyone loves me , and i intend to keep it that way .
i see your point .
why should i care?
you have to seduce young cecile .
she's quite cute , you know .
young , supple breasts .
a tight , firm ass .
uncharted booty .
be her captain picard , valmont .
boldly go ... ... where no man has gone before .
i can't .
why not?
come on , kathryn .
it's too easy .
get one of your moron friends to do it .
i've a reputation to uphold .
diddling the therapist's daughter?
she was overcharging .
this is a challenge .
i know all about menstrual cramps .
shut up and turn to page 64 .
why i plan to wait " , by annette hargrove , kansas city .
jesus christ , is she for real?
she's daddy's little angel .
a paradigm of chastity .
let's see .
boring , boring , boring ...
i love my parents .
making a mature decision ...
here !
she has a boyfriend named trevor .
going out for a year .
trevor understands .
trevor's a fag .
too bad she lives in kansas .
au contraire .
the virgin's father is the new headmaster at our school .
she's staying with my aunt while her parents sell the house .
can you imagine what this will do for my reputation?
screwing the new headmaster's daughter before school starts .
she'll be my greatest victory .
you don't stand a chance .
care to make a wager?
i'll think about it .
duty calls .
dr greenbaum and her daughter will be an exciting entry .
your journal ...
could you be more queer?
could you be more desperate to read it?
sebastian ...
could you come here for a second?
about that little wager of yours ...
count me in .
what are the terms?
if i win ...
your hot little car is mine .
and if i win?
you'll get something you've wanted since our parents got married .
be more specific .
in english ...
i'll fuck your brains out .
what makes you think i'll go for it?
that's a 1 956 jaguar roadster .
because i'm the only person you can't have , and it kills you .
no way .
you can put it anywhere .
you got yourself a bet , baby .
happy hunting , sebastian .
your home is beautiful , mrs rosemond .
it's been in my family for over 1 00 years .
does your family ride much?
my grandpa used to break horses .
what was that?
sebastian must be home .
pull !
sebastian !
fuck me ...
aunt helen !
god , i've missed you !
i've been looking all over for you .
i want you to meet annette .
annette hargrove , this is sebastian .
she'll be staying for a few weeks .
i guess that makes two of us .
welcome .
thank you .
aunt helen , why don't you whip up some of that ice tea of yours?
don't get into any trouble .
we won't .
come on .
quickly , lots to see .
i read your manifesto .
i must say , i found it rather appalling .
most people praise me for it .
most people are sheep .
you criticise something you've never experienced .
i just believe people shouldn't make love before they are in love .
people our age aren't mature enough to know those emotions .
are you a lesbian?
no .
i just picked up on a little of that lesbian vibe .
i wouldn't expect you to understand my beliefs .
what's that supposed to mean?
i know of your reputation .
what have you heard?
that you promise girls the world to get them in bed with you .
who told you this?
a friend wrote me .
that's a little tacky .
it's the truth , isn't it?
if you say so .
that's good .
let's try the g major scale .
once again .
remember , the third note is sharp .
i suck !
relax .
take a deep breath .
you're concentrating too much on your bowing .
let me help you .
close your eyes .
mai lee , be careful !
we've had this discussion .
i didn't mean to interrupt .
your playing was beautiful .
this is ronald clifford .
he'll be teaching me this summer .
nice to meet you .
likewise , i'm sure .
ronald is attending pre juilliard .
he's composing his first opera .
it's based on martin luther king .
dr king is my favourite .
i guess our hour's up .
same time tomorrow?
bye .
unbelievable .
some fag , no offence ,
wrote a letter to this chick describing my tactics .
any idea who it could be?
if i did , the person would suffer .
where is the little girl from?
kansas .
who do i know in kansas?
greg mcconnell .
the football stud?
i wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat .
he hates me .
i fingered his girlfriend at homecoming last year .
i don't think that bothered him .
what do you mean?
greg likes to tackle tight ends on and off the field .
you're shitting me .
i shit you not .
he used to sneak into my dorm drunk .
what are you doing?
i'm not a fag .
if you tell , i'll kick your ass !
i only put up with it because the man has a mouth like a hoover .
too bad he's in kansas .
not anymore .
the football team started practice last week .
we've already had a session .
good for you .
could you arrange a get together with him tonight?
spartacus " is on tv tonight .
outstanding .
but it'll cost you .
just make sure your front door is unlocked .
shall we say the stroke of midnight , no pun intended?
the stroke of midnight it is .
i take out my dick and i shove it right in her face .
i'm like , " suck it , you dumb bitch .
the gregster .
yes , the gregster .
gregory?
hi , blaine .
i hear you went on a date with court reynolds .
i hear he's nice .
he kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped on july 4th .
bulimic headcase?
what a loser she must be .
sorry .
court's invited me to the hamptons for labour day weekend .
that's great .
you think so?
i guess i'm just scared .
of what?
boys .
i've never even got to first base with a guy .
haven't you practiced on a girlfriend?
no , that's gross .
how do you think girls learn?
close your eyes and wet your lips .
are you for real?
do you want to learn?
i guess .
that wasn't so scary .
it was nothing .
let's try it again .
this time i'll stick my tongue in your mouth .
massage my tongue with yours .
that's what first base is .
okay .
eyes closed .
not bad .
that was cool .
maybe you should try it on your friend ronald sometime .
what are you saying?
it's obvious he's crazy about you .
he sends me love letters .
how romantic .
have you responded?
no .
don't you like him?
i think about him all the time .
if my mom found out she'd kill me .
you did hide the letters , right?
in an antique doll's house .
bring me copies of the letters .
why?
i'm great at love letters .
i'll have him eating out of the palm of your hand .
maybe you can meet at my house .
you'd do that for me?
of course .
we're friends , right?
best friends .
do you want to have a sleepover?
hello?
excuse me ...
excuse me ...
what a pleasant surprise .
the music's playing in every room .
it's not , just yours .
i thought you'd be pleased .
what are you doing in your room?
reading .
anything interesting?
yes , it's quite intriguing .
for you .
something to start the new school year with .
you didn't have to do this .
you hate it .
you just didn't have to do it .
can you join me for a swim?
it is ten o'clock , but we are reasonably young .
your proposal's only mildly insulting , so i'll consider it .
give me a minute .
fuck her yet?
i'm working on it .
call me later .
sebastian?
would you mind turning around so i can put on my bathing suit?
this is so embarrassing ...
it amazes me someone as charming as you can be so manipulative .
you're not going to start again?
what was my favourite part ..?
he has never uttered a single word without some dishonourable intent .
every woman he has pursued has regretted it .
stay away from him .
you could at least have the decency to tell me who's bad mouthing me .
not a chance .
you're right ... about what you said today .
i've done some things i'm not proud of .
i'm not giving you a hard time .
it's okay .
look at you , with all your morals and values ...
you seem to be happy in your choices .
i envy you .
no bullshit .
seriously .
you've got everything going for you .
you're smart , you're beautiful , you're determined .
you're everything i want in a girlfriend .
you know i'm seeing someone?
yes , the infamous trevor .
it's funny how you haven't mentioned him .
he's backpacking through europe .
he's great .
i really miss him .
i care .
i'm sorry , but you're not my type .
honestly?
you're smart , you're beautiful ... determined .
that won't get you anywhere .
the best you can hope for is my friendship .
good night , sweet pea .
oh , baby ...
" baby "?
right on time .
shit !
give me my underwear .
don't get so huffy .
what do we have here?
look , valmont , it's the first time i've ever done anything like this .
i was just ...
really drunk and blah blah blah .
please don't tell anyone .
this could ruin my whole career .
your career?
greg , what about your family?
wouldn't your dad be humiliated to find out his son's a fudge packer?
i'll do anything .
let's just forget about this whole thing , okay?
no .
i can't help you there .
you're bad mouthing me to annette hargrove .
what are you talking about?
you're the only one who knows her .
i never said a word to her about you .
he's probably telling you the truth .
the man can barely write out a grocery list , let alone a letter .
all right ...
i believe you .
your secret's safe with me .
actually , there is something you can do for me .
what else do you know about him?
well , he's smart as hell .
he's dedicated to achieving his goals .
he always gives 1 1 0 percent .
he's always watched my back .
he's got a bad rep , but it's mostly bullshit .
i've heard awful things about him .
from who?
i'm sworn to secrecy .
how long have we known each other?
forever .
it's my job to look out for you .
you're like a sister to me .
do i look like a gossip queen?
it's me .
greg .
the gregster .
i'm serious .
you swear not to tell anybody?
i swear on my momma's life .
that nosy bitch .
are you sure?
she said " mrs caldwell " .
they met at orientation .
did you do what i asked you to?
yeah .
she bought it?
i'm pretty sure .
pretty sure , or sure sure?
she bought it .
she tried to outdo me ,
even though i told her that i could do this .
my best friends sue , kelly and frances knew i could do it .
you okay?
yeah .
you would not believe ...
it's my mom .
i should get going .
see you tomorrow?
absolutely .
goodbye .
peace out .
peace out "?
moron .
okay , what's wrong with you?
are you ready for this?
i've discovered that mrs caldwell urged annette to stay away from me .
interesting .
yes , it is .
i now plan to devote all my energy to destroying the douchebag .
the plot thickens .
cecile has fallen for her music teacher .
mrs caldwell will love that .
but don juan moves with the speed of a special olympic hurdler .
what's your plan of attack?
i rat cecile out to mommy , who goes ballistic and ends the relationship .
but who will they turn to for help?
cecile is going away with court next week .
i need you to speed up her sexual awakening .
i'm at your service .
thank you .
that feels good .
sis , you're so tense .
i know ...
i hate it when things don't go my way .
it makes me so horny .
i hate it , too .
it seems like things are looking up for you .
it appears so .
any luck with your girl?
moving along quite well .
have you succeeded in your task?
any day now .
well , let me know when you do .
until then ...
down , boy !
come on !
hi , it's sebastian .
i didn't wake you , did l?
no , not at all .
did i leave my glasses there?
no , i don't think so .
all right .
i guess i'll see you around .
is that really why you called?
no .
i miss talking to you .
a moment of honesty .
well , i'm not liking it too much .
what are you doing tomorrow?
i'm going out with you .
i came as quick as i could .
what's wrong?
it's cecile .
you promise not to say anything?
yes .
it isn't drugs , is it?
it's worse .
i think there's something between cecile and her music teacher .
ronald?
that's crazy .
yes , she's so young , he's so ...
black !
brown sugar ... no sugar .
he's sent her love letters , they're under her doll's house .
something like this could destroy her reputation at manchester .
i hope i was right to tell you .
i'd hate to see her ruin it with court .
i can't thank you enough .
you will be discreet?
absolutely .
who the hell do you think you are?
excuse me?
i'm not paying you to pervert my child .
i think you're misunderstanding something .
care to explain this , then?
where did you find those?
margarita did , when cleaning .
go to your room ...
now !
how dare you disrespect me?
i got you off the streets .
the streets?
i live at 59th and park .
whatever .
you are never to set foot in this house again ,
and you are never to see my daughter again .
understood?
first of all , i never touched your daughter .
second , i'd like to think you could look beyond racial lines .
don't give me that racist crap .
we gave money to colin powell .
i guess that puts me in my place .
thank you for your hospitality .
it was a true awakening .
the black man is gone !
praise jesus , the black man is gone !
i never knew she felt this way .
you're a lucky guy .
what do i do?
tell her you love her .
mrs caldwell will have me shot if i go near her .
i don't even know her e mail address .
e mail is for geeks and paedophiles .
be romantic , write another letter .
how will it get to her?
we'll make sure she gets it .
why are you doing this for me?
because ...
we want to see cecile happy .
we know that you'd make her happy .
you'd make any girl happy .
you mind if i have some privacy?
my room's across the hall .
make yourself at home .
who are you calling?
cecile .
what are you doing?
you know the damage we'll cause?
i'm aware .
are you really?
we've done some fucked up shit , but this is ...
we're destroying an innocent girl .
court reynolds is going down .
if you won't help me , someone else will .
you amaze me .
eat me , sebastian .
you guys can fuck everyone , but i get dumped for twits like cecile .
god forbid i exude confidence and enjoy sex .
i must act like mary sunshine 24 7 so i can be considered a lady .
i'm the marcia brady of the east side and i want to kill myself .
there's your psychoanalysis , dr freud .
now tell me , are you in , or are you out?
call her .
it's kathryn .
okay , stop crying .
stop crying .
hold on for sebastian .
cecile?
stop crying .
listen to me very carefully .
i have a letter from ronald .
he asked me to give it to you .
i can't bring it to your house , your mother despises me , so listen ...
finished .
this doesn't taste like ice tea .
it's from long lsland .
how's the letter?
it's excellent .
do you think he'll like it?
he'll love it .
are you kidding?
what are you doing?
just taking a photo .
you know , you could be a model .
really?
too bad you're not sexy .
i can be sexy .
all right , show me sexy .
wow , that's very sexy .
make yourself more comfortable .
no , no .
come here .
now that's sexy .
cecile , you know what would be super duper sexy?
if you lost all the clothes .
i don't think so .
sorry , that was out of line .
i think i should go home now .
i'll have your mom pick you up .
you can't call my mom .
wow , she doesn't know you're here .
in fact , you're probably grounded .
i think i should call her anyway .
i'll do anything .
don't call !
cecile ...
all i want to do is give you a kiss .
just a kiss?
i swear .
what are you doing?
you promised to let me kiss you .
but then why ...
i don't want to kiss you here .
i want to kiss you there .
a promise is a promise , cecile .
a promise is a promise ...
it tickles .
cecile , are you up yet?
you're going to be late for the ...
cecile?
i need a hug .
cecile?
yeah .
jesus , where have you been?
shopping .
hurry up .
you're supposed to be at mrs rosemond's before brunch .
she's very important at the school , and i want you to look your best .
afternoon , ladies .
i didn't know you'd be here .
why waste such a lovely day in the city?
good point .
anyone for tennis?
excuse me .
that was rude .
she's very strange .
what am i going to do?
is something wrong?
mrs collins is short of volunteers at the retirement home .
but i have theatre tickets .
that's terrible .
i have a thought .
why don't you two fill in for me?
i'd love to .
you two are the best .
thank you .
it's so sweet of you .
i can't help it .
isn't he beautiful?
it's wonderful when you young people help out .
most of our patients have no family nearby .
mr gottlieb , we have a visitor for you .
no , i've got somebody special for you , baby .
did i ever tell you the time when my late husband ...
yes , mrs sugerman , you did .
right after we played backgammon .
we played backgammon?
you beat me three times .
then i fucked your daughter .
excuse me?
i said , " care for some water?
no , thank you .
come in .
how's it going in here?
we played backgammon , and i won three times .
that's the way to go !
isn't it wonderful?
i told you she was special .
that was fun .
i actually feel good about myself .
mrs sugerman is cool .
come on .
mrs sugerman is cool?
you must think i'm an idiot .
no .
you had a good time with her?
i did .
we played backgammon .
all right , i was bored out of my mind .
i hate doing charity .
it's okay .
that doesn't make you a bad person .
i can't win with you .
it's not about winning , sebastian .
your problem is , you take yourself too seriously .
i do not .
yes , you do .
try to lighten up .
i am .
can we drop this?
what are you doing?
stop it .
it's distracting .
cut it out .
stop it .
are you smiling?
no .
will you stop !
you can relax .
i promise i won't tell anybody .
who is it?
it's kathryn .
are you okay?
no !
what's wrong?
something bad happened last night .
what do you mean?
i don't think you want to know .
cecile , you have to tell me .
it involves your brother .
he ...
he took advantage of me .
why didn't you do something?
i don't know .
you came to our house late at night , and he forced intercourse on you .
not exactly .
he made you give him a blowjob?
no ...
what , then?
he took down my panties and wrote the alphabet with his tongue .
he went down on you?
if that's what you call it .
well , did you like it?
no .
i don't know , it was weird .
at first it felt icky ,
and then it was sort of okay .
then i started getting really hot , and then i started shaking ...
it was weird , it just felt like an explosion ...
but a good one .
cecile , you had an orgasm .
i did?
you're becoming a woman .
i am?
cecile !
now that you're on your way , it would be stupid of you to stop .
think of sebastian as a tutor .
let him instruct you .
but i don't love him .
i love ronald .
don't you want to make ronald happy?
practice makes perfect , cecile .
my advice is to sleep with as many people as possible .
that would make me a slut ...
wouldn't it?
cecile , everybody does it .
it's just that nobody talks about it .
like a secret society?
that's one way of looking at it .
fucking idiot ...
cool .
secret society , secret society ...
am i supposed to feel this sore?
just the first time .
it'll pass .
i like it better when i'm on top .
cecile ...
this is what i call " quiet time " , when we reflect on what we've done .
sorry .
something's the matter?
you think?
is it me?
no , you were fine .
it's that annette girl .
you love her , don't you?
it's okay .
i don't love you , either .
i love ronald .
where are you going?
i'm taking a shower .
want company?
no .
want a blowjob?
good night , cecile .
prude ...
who are you spying on?
is that her?
yeah .
she's crying .
little baby's upset by the big bad book .
shut up .
what's up your ass?
nothing .
she's getting to you , isn't she?
if you must know , yes .
i can't stand her holy bullshit , yet i'm totally infatuated with her .
she made me laugh .
that's why you're losing our bet?
no .
it's just taking longer than i expected .
do you mind if i take my new car for a ride?
kathryn ...
the only thing you're going to be riding is me .
if you'll excuse me , i have some work to do .
bonjour , mademoiselle .
bonjour , monsieur valmont .
i'm sorry about that .
i am too .
you know what?
i'm not sorry .
i thought we'd just be friends .
i can't keep my feelings all bottled up like you .
do you honestly feel nothing for me?
i have feelings for you .
then what's wrong?
it's not like you have a husband , unless you're married to jesus .
why can't we be together?
do you really want to know why?
it's because i don't trust myself with you .
come in .
i just came to say goodbye .
where are you going?
back to the city .
maybe to france for the end of the summer .
i can't take your games anymore .
what games?
come off it .
you're hot one minute , cold the next ...
you make me feel inadequate .
then i guess it's best you leave .
sebastian ...
i don't want us to part on bad terms .
i'm afraid you don't have a choice in the matter .
i don't associate with hypocrites .
how am i a hypocrite?
you spend all your time preaching about waiting for love .
now you're turning your back on it .
so i guess we're just fucked .
i'll move on , but you'll always know that you turned your back on love .
that makes you a hypocrite .
have a nice life .
wait ...
i'm sorry , i can't .
get it together , you pussy .
morning .
morning .
so , how did it go last night?
with who?
not cecile , i know all about that .
no , i didn't nail her .
she shot you down?
exactly the opposite .
what went wrong?
i don't know .
she was lying on the bed , ready to do it , and i was ...
i just didn't feel right about it .
you had your chance , and didn't?
she's not in her room .
where is she?
she left 30 minutes ago .
where did she go?
she told your aunt she was going to stay with friends .
you blew it .
that girl's come to her senses .
she'll never go near you again .
stupid , stupid ...
judy " .
i'll save that one .
it's valmont .
is she with you?
no , i don't know where she is .
why don't you leave her alone?
where is she?
she's staying with the mihallaks .
she caught a train into penn station about 20 minutes ago .
i'm impressed .
i'm in love .
are you okay?
just a minute .
come in .
bad time?
kind of .
you invited me in so i could witness your little adventure .
who is our friend who gives you such pleasure?
where could he be?
fucked up shit in this house ...
call me .
you don't get to have all the fun .
i assume you've come here to make arrangements .
some other time .
excuse me?
i'm not in the mood .
i want to fuck .
and i don't .
good afternoon , kathryn .
sounds great .
i love you , too .
i love you , too ...
you're completely pussy whipped .
stop it .
what happened to us?
nothing has changed .
yes , it has .
you don't love me anymore .
come on , it's just a bet .
this is ridiculous .
you're ridiculous , dear brother .
look what you've been reduced to .
what'll happen when school starts?
you're dating miss seventeen magazine , the headmaster's daughter .
before you know it , you'll be giving campus tours with her .
her father doesn't know about your past , does he?
i doubt he'd let his little princess be seen with you .
it's disappointing to see annette's manifesto was a total sham .
as student body president , i feel it's my duty to tell him .
put the phone down .
this won't take a second .
quite the predicament you're in .
i was planning on telling her everything this afternoon .
that's right , i forgot .
you're so in love .
you honestly believe you've changed in the few days you've known her?
let me tell you something .
people don't change overnight .
you and i are two of a kind .
i'm not afraid to admit it .
you were going to leave school a legend , now you'll leave a joke .
i'm willing to take my chances .
don't do it , sebastian .
you won't only ruin your reputation , you'll destroy hers .
this is my room .
can we be quiet?
i have something to tell you .
tell me .
this isn't working out for me .
yeah , me neither .
what's wrong?
it's me .
i'm completely fucked up .
what are you saying?
i thought i was in love with you , but it was just a lie .
i wanted it to work , but unfortunately i feel nothing .
why are you doing this?
i wanted to get you into bed .
you don't mean that .
you know nothing .
you don't even know me .
the fact is , there is someone i love .
you don't even compare to her .
i don't believe you .
i don't know how to make it clearer .
you mean nothing to me .
you were just ...
you were just a conquest .
you're such a coward .
look , you're shaking .
is that what you came to tell me?
i'm sorry .
i'm completely ...
you're completely fucked up .
get out .
get out !
don't touch me ...
don't touch me .
don't fucking touch me , sebastian !
just leave .
jesus ...
a bit melodramatic , don't you think?
i thought you'd like to know what happened with annette .
it's over .
really?
you were right .
i can't change .
you and i are two of a kind .
i thought we should celebrate .
sorry .
i'm expecting some company .
who?
ronald?
not that it concerns you , but yes .
from ronald .
i haven't had a chance to read it ,
you mean a lot to me , i hope we can be friends , etc .
i expected this shit , so i took the liberty of getting them together .
you were right .
you do get dumped for the innocent little twits .
well done .
thank you .
now ...
where were we?
oh yes , the celebration .
what shall we toast to?
to my triumph .
not my choice , but it's your call .
to your triumph over annette .
what's so funny?
silly boy ...
my triumph isn't over her .
it's over you .
again?
you were very much in love with her .
and you're still in love with her .
but it amused me to make you ashamed of it .
you gave up your first love because i threatened your reputation .
don't you get it?
you're just a toy , sebastian .
a little toy i like to play with .
and now you've blown it with her .
i think it's the saddest thing i've ever heard .
cheers .
it tastes good .
you came to make arrangements , but i don't fuck losers .
goodbye , sebastian .
it's imperative i talk to her .
she's not here .
will you please tell her i called?
of course i will .
yes?
i need to speak to annette .
she's not here .
i'm entertaining some guests ...
i already told you she is not here .
will you see she gets this?
yes .
it's really important .
i understand .
i'm terribly sorry .
you never know who's going to show up here .
dear annette , what can i say to rectify the harm i've caused you?
being with you was the only time i've ever been happy .
my whole life has been a joke .
i prided myself on taking joy in others 'misery .
well , it finally backfired .
i succeeded in hurting the first person i loved .
enclosed is my most prized possession .
myjournal .
i considered it my trophy .
a collection of my conquests .
if you want to know the truth , please read it .
no more lies .
please give me another chance .
i'm a wreck without you .
ronald?
it's kathryn .
what's up?
is everything okay?
no .
it's sebastian .
he's out of his mind .
he hit me , then he took off .
i'm afraid to be alone .
ronald , i really need you .
settle down .
there's more .
it involves cecile .
stay there .
i'll be right over .
son of a bitch ...
valmont !
hey , ronald .
we have some talking to do .
later .
i've had a real bad night .
what's your problem?
why did you hit kathryn?
she got to you , too ...
you don't know what you're saying .
she also said you fucked cecile .
it's true , isn't it?
ronald , i'm sorry ...
sebastian?
sebastian !
stop it !
annette !
sebastian ...
i love you , annette .
i love you , too .
just hold on ...
as the new headmaster of manchester prep
it saddens me to start our new year with such a mournful tone .
i didn't know anyone was in here .
i'm sorry .
annette hargrove .
kathryn merteuil .
have we met?
i don't think so .
your father's the new headmaster?
that's right .
i'm sorry to hear about your brother .
are you okay?
i'll be fine .
did you know sebastian?
you might say that .
such a tragedy , isn't it?
yes , it is .
i'll leave you alone now .
i'm here if you need a friend .
that's great .
sometimes when i feel i can't go on ,
i turn to jesus , and he helps me through it .
thank you .
i'll see you around campus .
looking forward to it ... ... freak .
here we go .
however dark the cloud , there's always a silver lining .
it might be hard to see , but what we should learn from this
is to be true to ourselves and to resist peer pressure .
as student body president i've tried to set an example in myself .
unfortunately , i couldn't reach out to my stepbrother in time .
i know he's looking down on us today and ...
i know he'd want me to say ...
he'd want me to say , " kathryn ...
he'd want me to say , " kathryn , i'm sorry .
what is going on?
don't you have any respect?
