hey , hey .
hey , hey .
slim?
yeah .
i can't keep up with that guy .
it'll kill me .
all right .
jack !
yeah .
take mike's place .
aw , slim .
just for a while .
mike , you take jack's place .
you're on there .
so how long you and lennie been together , george?
a long time .
a real long time .
really?
seems kinda funny , you two travelling around together .
what's funny about it?
well , a cuckoo like him and a smart guy like you .
well , i ain't so smart or i wouldn't be bucking barley for my 50 bucks a month .
i guess you're right .
how'd you two meet up?
well , i knew his aunt clara .
she took him when he was a boy .
she raised him up .
when she died , lennie just come along with me working .
uh huh .
i used to play jokes on him cos he's too damn dumb to take care of himself .
he'd do any damn thing i told him .
put that on back in here .
one day , a bunch of guys standing around on the sacramento river ,
i turns to him and i says " jump in , lennie .
and he jumps .
couldn't swim a stroke .
he damn near drowned before we could get to him .
he was so damn nice to me for pulling him out , he forgot i told him to jump in .
he's a nice fella .
a guy don't need no sense to be a nice fella .
yeah .
he gets in trouble all the time cos he's so goddamn dumb .
like what happened up north in weed .
what'd he do in weed?
he seen this girl , in a red dress , and the dumb bastard that he is , he just ...
he wants to touch everything he likes , so he reaches out to touch this red dress .
so the girl starts screaming , and that gets lennie all mixed up , so he holds on and he won't let go , cos that's the only thing he can think to do .
so what happened?
well , she runs off across the field , screaming .
so me and lennie take off running .
pretty soon we hear a bunch of guys with dogs coming after us .
had to hide in the irrigation ditch until it was safe to get away .
he didn't hurt the girl none?
hell , no .
he just scared her .
well ... he ain't mean .
i can tell a mean guy a mile off .
milton !
i ain't payin 'you to stand around .
get back to work .
he just come over for a drink of water .
you get back to work .
you get these men moving .
they're way behind .
you men get moving here .
let's go .
goddamnit , stop that racket !
lennie .
i told you not to bring that pup in here .
i ain't got no pup .
any of you boys seen my wife?
she ain't been here .
where the hell's slim?
went out to the barn .
carlson , do you think he's gonna find slim in the barn with his wife?
better not tangle with slim .
curley's lookin 'for a fight .
i gotta see this .
come on .
no , i'll stay here .
thanks .
was curley's wife in the barn?
if she was , i didn't see her .
george .
both the ends is the same .
why both the ends is the same?
it's just the way they make 'em .
you sure she didn't come in the barn , like she come in here?
no , she never .
give me a good whorehouse every time .
a guy can go in , get drunk , get it all out of his system all at once , and no messes .
george .
yeah?
how long is it gonna be till we get the little place and live off the fat of the land?
gotta get some money together first .
i know a little place where you can get cheap , but they ain't giving it away .
tell about that place .
it's ten acres .
it's got a windmill .
got a little shack on it , and a chicken run .
got rabbits , george?
i could easily build a few hutches and you could feed 'em alfalfa .
you're damn right .
you're goddamn right i could .
but , george , tell about the house .
well , we have a little house , and we have a room to ourself .
and we have a little , fat , iron stove , and in the winter we keep a fire going in it .
and rabbits , george .
and that ...
but i tend 'em .
how do i tend them rabbits?
well , you go out to the alfalfa field .
you have a sack .
you fill up that sack and you bring it in and you put it in the rabbit cage .
you have a few pigeons that fly around the windmill ,
like they done when i was a kid .
and it'd be our home .
nobody could can us .
we don't like a guy , we just say " get the hell out .
if a friend come , we'd have an extra bunk .
we'd say " why don't you spend the night? " and , by god , he would .
we'd have a dog and a couple of cats , but you got to make sure them cats don't get them rabbits .
but ... you just let them try .
i'm gonna break them goddamn cats 'necks .
i smash them cats with a stick .
you know a place like this?
suppose i do .
what's it to you?
how much they want for a place like that?
could get it for 600 bucks .
600 .
old people that owns it is broke .
i ain't much good with only one hand .
that's why they give me a job sweeping .
and they give me $250 cos i lost my hand .
and i got 50 more saved in the bank right now .
that's , uh ... 300 .
and i got 50 more coming at the end of the month .
suppose i went in with you fellas .
that'd be $350 that i'd put in .
now , let me tell you something .
i could cook , and i could tend the chickens , and i could hoe in the garden .
huh?
now , how would that be?
ok .
i got to think about that .
we was gonna do it by ourselves .
we were gonna do it by ourselves .
well , now , wait a minute .
i'll tell you what .
i'd make a will and leave my share to you guys in case i kick off .
i ain't got no relatives or nothin '.
you fellas got any money?
maybe we can do it now .
we got ten bucks between us .
we got ten bucks .
ten bucks .
yeah .
you seen what they done to my dog?
they said he wasn't no good no more .
i wish somebody'd shoot me when i ain't no good , but they won't do that .
they'li can me , and i ain't gonna have no place to go .
look , if me and lennie work a month and we don't spend nothin ', we'li have 1 00 bucks .
and you got 350?
yeah , and you can have every cent of it .
that'd be 450 .
jesus christ , i bet we could get it for that .
you two could get her started .
i'd work and make up the rest .
i'm gonna take that goddamn pup .
sure , sure , sure .
you know what i'm gonna do?
i'll write those two old people that we'll take it .
candy will send $1 00 to hold it?
i sure will .
i'li have 30 more dollars the time you guys is ready to quit .
i get to tend the rabbits .
tell him , george .
tell him he can't do it .
i'll get to hoe in the garden , even if i ain't no good at it?
they got a nice stove there?
yeah , yeah .
they got a real nice stove !
but i bet that pup will like it there .
we're gonna do it , goddamnit .
we can fix up that little old place and live there .
when we gonna do it?
one month .
right smack in one month .
now , don't tell nobody about it .
just us three and nobody else .
don't tell nobody .
george , i ought to have shot that dog myself .
i should not let no stranger shoot my dog .
shut up .
i'm tired of ...
i just asked you !
you've been asking me too often and i'm damn sick of it .
if you can't look after your goddamn wife , what do you expect me to do about it , huh?
lay off me .
didn't mean nothing by it .
i said lay off .
just thought you might have seen her .
tell her to stay home .
you keep out of this .
you goddamn punk .
you're yellow as a frog belly .
you may be the best welterweight in the country ,
but i'll kick your goddamn head in .
what the hell you laughing about?
huh?

come on , you big bastard , get up .
no big son of a bitch is gonna laugh at me .
get up .
i'll show you who's yellow .
you got no cause for ...
get up !

you can ask george .
you travel around with george , don't you?

me and george go everywhere together .
and sometimes he talk to you and you don't understand what the hell he's talking about .

how long do you think it's gonna be before them puppies are old enough to take away from its mother?
boy , i tell you .
a guy can talk to you and be sure you ain't gonna go blabbing .
uh uh !

curley got mad at me after supper , broke all my records .
i know how you got them bruises on your face .
and how curley got his hand busted .
he got his hand caught in a machine .
yeah .

someday i'm going into town , and no one's ever gonna see me again .

george , she's crying .

george , i'll tell you what .
i'd feel a lot better sending the money now .
well , let me think about it .
we'll be there before you know it .
come on , crooks , put it in .
oh , good shot .

why did you get killed?

george says i ain't got nothing to do with you .
george giving you orders about everything?
i ain't gonna talk to you or nothing .
the guys got a horseshoe tournament going on .
none of them guys is gonna leave .
why can't i talk to you?
i never get to talk to nobody .
i get awful lonely .
i ain't supposed to talk to you .
you can talk to people , but i can't talk to nobody but curley , or else he gets mad .
how'd you like not to talk to anybody?
what you got covered up there?
i ...
that's the pup .
that's the little pup .
why , it's dead .
but i was just playin 'with him .
don't you worry none .
he's just a mutt .
you can get another one , easy .
well , it ain't that so much , but george ain't gonna let me tend them rabbits now .
why don't he?
well , he said when ...
i did any bad things , then i wouldn't be able to tend them rabbits .
don't you worry about talking to me .
listen to the guys yell .
they ain't gonna leave till it's over .
i ain't supposed to talk to you .
george said he'd give me hell .
he told me this .
well , what's the matter with me?
ain't i got a right to talk to nobody?
george says you get the people in a mess .
oh , nuts .
what kinda harm am i doing to you?
i tell ya , i ain't used to living like this .
i could've made something outta myself .
maybe i will yet .
a show come through salinas , and i met one of the actors .
he says i could go with the show .
my old lady wouldn't let me , but this guy says i coulda .
if i went , i wouldn't be living like this .
you bet .
say , we were supposed to get a little place and then get rabbits .
another time , i met a guy he was in the pictures .
went out to the riverside dance palace with him .
he says he was gonna put me in the movies .
he says i was a natural .
as soon as he got back to hollywood he was gonna write to me about it .
i never did get that letter .
i always thought my old lady stole it , too .
she said no .
so , um ...
i married curley .
met him out at the riverside dance palace that same night .
are you listenin '?
sure .
i ain't told this to nobody before .
and maybe i oughtn't to .
i don't like curley .
he ain't a nice fella .
i could've been in the movies .
had nice clothes .
this guy said i was a natural .
maybe if you took this pup and you throwed him away , then george would never know and i'd get to tend them rabbits with no trouble .
what makes you so nuts about rabbits?
i like to pet nice things with the fingers .
soft things .
well , who don't?
everybody likes that .
do you like to feel velvet?
you bet , by god .
i had me some too .
the lady give me some and then i lost it .
you're nuts .
but you're kinda a nice fella .
just like a big baby .
sometimes when i'm doing my hair , i just sit and stroke it cos it's so soft .
feel right here .
that's nice .
like it , don't ya?
i like it too .
it feels nice .
that's nice .
that's nice .
