hello , mrs. macgruder .
hello , miss daniels .
have you ever seen so many gulls?
what do you suppose it is?
there must be a storm at sea .
that can drive them inland , you know .
i was hoping you'd be a little late .
he hasn't arrived yet .
but you said 3 : 00 .
i know .
i know .
i've been calling all morning .
oh , miss daniels , you have no idea .
they are so difficult to get .
really , they are .
we have to get them from india when they're baby chicks , and then
this one won't be a chick , will he?
oh , no , certainly not .
this will be a full grown mynah bird .
and he'll talk?
well , yes , of course he'll
well , no , you'll have to teach him to talk .
i guess maybe i'd better phone .
they said 3 : 00 .
maybe it's the traffic .
i'll call .
would you mind waiting?
well , maybe you'd better deliver him .
let me give you my address .
oh , well , all right , but i'm sure they're on the way .
would you mind if i called?
no .
all right .
i wonder if you could help me .
what?
i said , i wonder if you could help me .
yes .
what is it you're looking for , sir?
lovebirds .
lovebirds , sir?
yes .
i understand there are different varieties .
is that true?
well , yes , there are .
well , these are for my sister for her birthday , and as she's only gonna be 1 1 , i wouldn't want a pair of birds ... that were ... too demonstrative .
i understand completely .
at the same time , i wouldn't want them to be too aloof .
no , of course not .
do you happen to have a pair of birds that are ... just friendly?
oh , i think so .
now , then , let me see .
aren't those lovebirds?
no .
those are , uh ... red birds .
i thought they were strawberry finches .
yes .
we call them that too .
here we are .
lovebirds .
those are canaries .
doesn't this make you feel awful?
doesn't what make me feel having all these poor , innocent creatures caged up like this?
well , we can't just let them fly around the shop .
i suppose not .
i is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
certainly .
it's to protect the species .
yes , that's important , especially during the molting season .
that's a particularly dangerous time .
are they molting now?
oh , some of them are .
how can you tell?
well , they ... get a sort of hangdog expression .
yes , i see .
well , what about the lovebirds?
are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead?
we have some very nice canaries this week .
all right .
all right .
may i see it , please?
oh !
oh !
what is it?
oh !
oh !
oh !
oh !
oh !
oh !
oh !
there we are .
oh , there .
wonderful .
back in your gilded cage , melanie daniels .
what did you say?
i was merely drawing a parallel , miss daniels .
how did you know my name?
a little birdie told me .
good day , miss daniels .
madam .
hey , wait a minute .
i don't know you .
ah , but i know you .
how?
we met in court .
we never met in court or anyplace else .
that's true .
i'll rephrase it .
i saw you in court .
when?
don't you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a window?
i didn't break that window .
yes , but your little prank did .
the judge should've put you behind bars .
what are you , a policeman?
i merely believe in the law .
and i'm not too keen on practical jokers .
what do you call your lovebird story  i really wanted the lovebirds .
you knew i didn't work here .
you deliberately i recognized you when i came in .
i thought you might like to know what it's like to be on the other end of a gag .
what do you think of that?
i think you're a louse .
i am .
good day , miss daniels .
madam .
and i'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds .
i'll find something else .
see you in court .
who was that man?
i have no idea .
they said the mynah bird would be here later this afternoon , if you care to come back .
no , you'd better send him .
may i use this phone?
why , certainly .
daily news?
it's melanie daniels .
could you get me the city desk?
just a minute , mrs. macgruder .
hello , charlie .
melanie .
i want you to do a favor for me .
no , this is a small one .
pressure you?
why , charlie , darling , would i try to pressure you?
would you call the department of motor vehicles for me?
w j h 0 0 3 .
yes , a california plate .
no .
i'll stop off in a little while .
is daddy in his office?
no , i don't want to break in on a meeting .
tell him i'll see him later .
thank you , charlie .
do you have any lovebirds?
well , no , not in the shop , but i can order them for you .
how soon?
well well , when would you want them?
immediately .
well , i could probably have them here by tomorrow morning .
would that be all right?
that would be just fine .
miss , is that for mitch brenner?
yes .
he's not home .
that's all right .
he won't be back until monday i mean , if those birds are for him .
monday?
yes .
i don't think you should leave them in the hall , do you?
well where did he go?
bodega bay .
he goes there every weekend .
bodega bay .
where's that?
up the coast , about 60 miles north of here .
sixty mi oh !
it's an hour and a half by freeway , or two hours if you take the coast highway .
i'd look after them myself , but i'm going away too .
i'm awfully sorry .
good morning .
good morning .
i wonder if you could help me .
i'll try my best .
i'm looking for a man named mitchell brenner .
yeah .
do you know him?
yeah .
where does he live?
right here , bodega bay .
yes , i know , but where?
right across the bay there .
where?
now , see where i'm pointing?
yes .
see them two big trees across there?
on the other side of the bay?
yes .
and the white house?
yes .
that's where the brenners live .
the brenners?
mr. and mrs. brenner?
no . just jydia and the two kids .
the two kids?
yeah , mitch and the little girl .
oh , i see .
how do i get down there?
you follow the road around the bay , and that'll take you to their front door .
the front door .
is there a back road i can take?
no .
that's the only road .
you see , i want to surprise them .
oh .
i don't want them to see me arrive .
oh .
it's a surprise , you see .
well , you could get yourself a boat and cut right across the bay to their dock .
where would i get a boat?
down by the tides restaurant .
did you ever handle an outboard boat?
of course .
want me to order one for you?
well , thank you .
what name?
daniels .
okay .
i wonder if you could tell me yeah .
hold it a minute , please .
the little girl's name?
the little brenner girl?
yes .
uh , alice , i think .
harry , what's the brenner girl's name?
j ois . alice , isn't it? no , it's j ois .
it's alice .
are you sure?
well , i'm not positive , if that's what you mean .
i need her exact name .
oh , uh just hold on one more minute , please .
in that case , i'll tell you what you do .
go straight through town till you see a little hotel on your left .
then you turn right there .
now , you got that?
yes .
near the top of the hill , you'll see the school , and just beyond , a little house with a red mailbox .
that's where annie hayworth , the schoolteacher , lives .
you ask her about the little brenner girl .
well , thank you .
save yourself a lot of trouble .
name's alice for sure .
can i have the boat in about 20 minutes?
how much for the phone calls?
oh , it's nothing .
thank you .
who is it?
me .
who's " me "?
miss hayworth?
yes .
i'm melanie daniels .
i'm sorry to bother you , but yes?
the man at the post office sent me .
he said you could tell me the name of the brenner girl .
cathy?
the one who lives in the white house across the bay?
that's the one .
cathy brenner .
he seemed sure it was either alice or lois .
which is why the mail never gets delivered to the right place in this town .
i'm sorry .
smoke?
thank you .
did , uh you want to see cathy about something?
well , not exactly .
oh .
are you a friend of mitch's?
no , not really .
i've been wanting a cigarette for the last 20 minutes .
i just couldn't convince myself to stop .
this tilling of the soil can become compulsive , you know .
it's a very pretty garden .
oh , thank you .
well , it's something to do in your spare time .
there's a lot of spare time in bodega bay .
are , uh , you planning on staying long?
no , just a few hours .
then you're leaving after you see cathy .
well , something like that .
i'm sorry .
i don't mean to sound so mysterious .
actually , it's none of my business .
well , i better be on my way .
thank you very much .
not at all .
did you drive up from san francisco by the coast road?
yes .
nice drive .
it's very beautiful .
is that where you met mitch?
yes .
yes .
i guess that's where everyone meets mitch .
now you sound a bit mysterious , miss hayworth .
do i?
i don't mean to .
actually , i'm an open book , i'm afraid .
or , rather , a closed one .
oh , pretty .
what are they?
lovebirds .
i see .
good luck , miss daniels .
thank you .
can i get out this way?
go right around .
it'll take you back to the main road .
thank you .
do you have a boat for miss daniels?
yes , ma'am .
it's the one right below .
are you all right?
yes , i think so .
what made it do that?
that's the damnedest thing i ever saw .
it seemed to swoop down at you deliberately .
oh , you're bleeding too .
let's take care of that .
okay?
that's a girl .
come on .
what happened , mitch?
gull hit her .
a gull?
oh .
let's try up at the restaurant , all right?
might need a tetanus shot .
i had a booster before i went abroad last may .
what happened?
hello , deke .
young lady cut herself .
shall i call a doctor?
i don't think it's that serious .
let's see .
helen , get some cotton and antiseptic .
um , you cut yourself outside , miss?
don't worry , deke .
she did it in a boat .
i had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once .
sued me before i could bat an eyelash .
i don't think miss daniels is gonna sue anybody .
here .
well , you're the lawyer .
thank you .
what's that?
just some peroxide .
i'll clean out the cut .
so you're a lawyer .
that's right .
of course , i usually defend people , but if i were prosecuting
do you practice here?
uh uh , san francisco .
what are you doing up here?
what kind of law?
criminal .
is that why you want to see everyone behind bars?
oh , not everyone .
only violators and practical jokers .
that's right .
ow !
oh , sorry .
what are you doing up here?
didn't you see the lovebirds?
you mean , you came all this way to bring me those birds?
to bring your sister those birds .
you said it was her birthday .
besides , i was coming up anyway .
what for?
to see a friend of mine .
careful .
oh , sorry .
uh ... who's your friend?
annie hayworth , the schoolteacher .
annie hayworth .
well , small world .
yes .
how do you know annie?
we went to school together college .
did you?
imagine that .
how long are you staying up here?
the weekend .
well , i think the bleeding's almost stopped .
why don't you hold that on
so you came up to see annie , huh?
yes .
i think you came up to see me .
now , why would i want to see you of all people?
i don't know , but you must've gone to a lot of trouble ... to find out who i was and where i lived .
it was no trouble at all .
i simply called my father's newspaper .
besides , i was coming up anyway .
i've already told you that .
you really like me , huh?
i loathe you .
you have no manners .
you're arrogant and conceited .
i wrote you a letter about it , in fact , but i tore it up .
what did it say?
none of your business .
i can't say i like your seagulls much , either .
i come all the way up here to you were coming up anyway , remember?
mitch?
i thought i saw your car .
what are you doing in town?
i had to acknowledge a delivery .
a what?
mother , i'd like you to meet melanie daniels .
miss daniels , my mother .
how do you do?
how do you do , miss daniels?
acknowledge a what?
a delivery .
miss daniels brought us some birds from san francisco .
oh .
for cathy for her birthday .
where is she?
across at brinkmeyer's .
miss daniels is staying up here for the weekend .
so i've already invited her for dinner tonight .
well , you did go to the trouble of bringing those birds .
oh , i couldn't possibly .
you did say birds?
yes , lovebirds .
oh , i see .
so we couldn't let you get away without thanking you in some small way .
and you haven't met cathy , and you are staying the weekend .
well , yes , but you are , aren't you?
certainly , but then it's all settled .
what time is dinner , mother?
7 : 00 , the same as usual .
i'll pick you up .
where are you staying?
with annie , of course .
oh , of course .
how stupid of me .
a quarter of 7 : 00?
annie may have made other plans .
i'll have to see .
besides , i can find my own way .
you're sure now?
you won't hire a boat or anything?
i'm sure .
7 . : 00 , then .
maybe .
we'll be waiting for you .
how's your head?
much better , thank you .
a gull hit me , mrs. brenner , that's all .
oh , hi .
did you find her all right?
yes , i did .
i was wondering
uh , that sign there .
do you suppose i could have the room for just a single night?
i was planning on renting it for a longer time i would appreciate it .
i've tried everywhere in town .
they're all full .
well , all right .
got your bags in the car?
well , it's utilitarian , i'll say that .
i just picked up some things for the night at the general store .
i hadn't planned on staying very long .
yes , i know .
did something unexpected come up?
yes .
may i use your phone?
i'd like to call home .
i just put some coffee on the stove .
don't they ever stop migrating?
hi !
hi !
miss daniels?
yes .
oh , they're beautiful !
they're just what i wanted .
is there a man and a woman?
i can't tell which is which .
well , i suppose so .
hello there .
annie had no plans , huh?
no .
we're very glad you could come .
are you hungry?
reasonably .
dinner's just about ready .
we've been looking at the chickens .
something seems to be wrong with them .
there's nothing wrong with those chickens .
i'm going to call fred brinkmeyer right now .
what good's that gonna do?
the chickens won't eat .
he sold the feed to me , didn't he?
caveat emptor , mother .
let the buyer beware .
whose side are you on?
merely quoting the law , dear .
never mind the law .
this won't take long , miss dan hello , fred?
lydia brenner .
i didn't interrupt your dinner , did i?
how about a drink?
i'd love one .
that feed you sold me is no good .
the chicken feed .
well , it's just no good .
the chickens won't eat it .
they're always hungry .
i opened a sack for them when i got home , and they just wouldn't touch it .
you know chickens as well as i do , and when they won't eat , there's something wrong with what they're being fed .
no , they're not fussy chickens .
who?
what's he got to do with it?
is that your father?
mm hmm .
please sit down .
i don't care how many sacks of feed you sold him .
my chicken
oh , i see .
dan fawcett .
this afternoon?
that proves what i'm saying .
the feed you sold us
oh .
well , maybe i better go over and see him .
you don't think there's something going around , do you?
no , never !
no , they don't seem sick at all .
they just won't eat .
uh huh .
well , i'll try to go over and see him .
maybe he
uh huh .
all right .
thanks .
he had a call from dan fawcett a while ago .
his chickens won't eat either .
it's what you said , mom .
mr. brinkmeyer's feed is no good .
no , cathy .
he sold mr. fawcett a different brand .
you don't think they're getting sick , do you , mitch?
i still don't understand how you knew i wanted lovebirds .
your brother told me .
then you knew mitch in san francisco?
is that right?
no , not exactly .
mitch knows a lot of people in san francisco .
of course , they're mostly hoods .
cathy !
well , mom , he's the first to admit it .
he's spends half his day in the detention cells at the hall of justice .
in a democracy , cathy , everyone is entitled to a fair trial .
your brother's practice aw , mom , please !
i know all that democracy jazz .
they're still hoods .
he has a client now who shot his wife in the head six times .
six times !
can you imagine it?
i mean , even twice would be overdoing it , don't you think?
why did he shoot her?
he was watching a ball game on television .
what?
his wife changed the channel .
are you coming to my party tomorrow?
i don't think so .
i have to get back to san francisco .
don't you like us?
oh , darling , of course i do .
don't you like bodega bay?
i don't know yet .
mitch likes it very much .
he comes up every weekend , you know , even though he has his own apartment in the city .
he says san francisco's like an anthill at the foot of a bridge .
i suppose it does get hectic at times .
well , if you do decide to come , don't say i told you about it .
it's supposed to be a surprise party .
they've got this whole complicated thing figured out ... where i'm going to michele's for the afternoon , and michele's mother will say that she has a headache , would i mind if she took me home .
then when i get home here , all the kids'll jump out !
oh , won't you come?
won't you please come?
i don't think so .
she's a charming girl , isn't she , mitch?
hmm?
yes .
certainly pretty .
mm hmm .
how long have you known her?
now , i told you , dear , we met yesterday .
in a bird shop .
in a bird shop .
she was selling birds?
no , no .
i just led her into believing that i believed she was , and then
it's all very complicated .
but she did buy the lovebirds and then drove all the way here .
mother .
yes?
where did you go to law school?
forgive me .
i suppose i'm just naturally curious about a girl like that .
she's very rich , isn't she?
yeah , i suppose so .
her father's part owner of one of the big newspapers .
you'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print .
she's always mentioned in the columns , mitch .
yes , i know .
she is the one who jumped into a fountain in rome last summer , isn't she?
yes .
i supposed i'm old fashioned .
i know it was supposed to be very warm there , but
well , actually the newspapers said she was naked .
yes , i know , dear .
it's none of my business , but when you bring a girl like that
darling?
yes?
i think i can handle melanie daniels by myself .
well ... as long as you know what you want , mitch .
i know exactly what i want .
be able to find your way back all right?
oh , yes .
will i be seeing you again?
san francisco's a long way from here .
i'm in san francisco five days a week with a lot of time on my hands .
i'd like to see you .
maybe we could go swimming or something .
mother tells me you like to swim .
how does mother know what i like to do?
we read the same gossip column .
oh , that rome .
i really like to swim .
we might get along very well .
in case you're interested , i was pushed into that fountain .
without any clothes on?
with all my clothes on .
the newspaper that ran that story ... happens to be a rival of my father's paper .
you were just a poor , innocent victim of circumstances?
i'm neither poor nor innocent .
the truth of that particular the truth is , you're running around with a pretty wild crowd .
yes , that's the truth , but i was pushed into that fountain , and that's the truth too .
uh huh .
do you really know annie hayworth?
no .
at least i didn't until i came up here .
so you didn't go to school together?
no .
and you didn't come here to see her?
no !
you were lying !
yes , i was lying .
what about the letter you wrote me?
is that a lie?
no , i wrote the letter .
well , what did it say?
it said , " dear mr. brenner .
i think you need these lovebirds after all .
they may help your personality .
that's what it said .
but you tore it up?
yes .
why?
because it seemed stupid and foolish .
like jumping into a fountain in rome .
i told you what happened !
you don't expect me to believe that , do you?
i don't give a damn what you believe !
i'd still like to see you .
why?
i think it might be fun .
that might've been good enough in rome , but it's not good enough now .
it is for me .
well , not for me .
what do you want?
i thought you knew .
i want to go through life ... jumping into fountains naked .
good night .
miss daniels , is that you?
yes .
hi .
is something wrong?
is that cut beginning to bother you?
no , it's not the cut that's bothering me .
would you like some brandy?
if you have some , i'd love it .
i'll get it .
why don't you sit down .
oh , would you like a sweater or something , a quilt?
no .
no , thank you .
won't you call me melanie?
all right .
thank you .
gets a bit chilly here at night sometimes , especially if you're over near the bay .
well , how did your evening go?
did you meet jydia?
or would you rather i changed the subject?
i think so .
well , how do you like our little hamlet?
i despise it .
i suppose it doesn't offer much to the casual visitor , unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside .
it takes a bit of getting used to .
where are you from originally?
san francisco .
how did you happen to come up here?
a friend invited me up for a weekend a long time ago .
look , i see no reason for being coy about this .
it was mitch brenner .
i guess you knew that anyway .
i suspected as much .
well , you needn't worry .
it's been over and done with a long time ago .
annie , there's nothing between mr. brenner and me .
isn't there?
well , maybe there isn't .
maybe there's never been anything between mitch and any girl .
what do you mean?
i think i'll have some of that .
i was seeing a lot of him in san francisco .
one weekend , he invited me up to meet lydia .
when was this?
oh , four years ago , shortly after his father died .
of course , things may be different now .
different?
with lydia .
did she seem a trifle distant?
mm , a trifle .
well , then perhaps things aren't quite so different .
you know , her attitude nearly drove me crazy .
when i got back to san francisco , i spent days trying to figure out ... what i'd done to displease her .
well , what had you done?
nothing .
i simply existed .
so what's the answer?
ajealous woman , right?
a clinging , possessive mother?
wrong .
with all due respect to oedipus , i don't think that was the case .
then what was it?
lydia liked me .
that's the strange part .
now that i'm no longer a threat , we're very good friends .
then why did she object to you?
because she was afraid .
afraid you'd take mitch?
afraid i'd give mitch .
i don't understand .
afraid of any woman who would give mitch the one thing lydia can give him : love .
that adds up to a jealous , possessive woman .
no , i don't think so .
you see , she's not afraid of losing mitch .
she's only afraid of being abandoned .
someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter .
no .
she already has a daughter .
well , what about mitch?
didn't he have anything to say about this?
well , i can understand his position .
he'd just been through a lot with lydia after his father died .
he didn't want to risk going through it all again .
oh , i see .
so it ended .
not right then , of course .
we went back to san francisco , saw each other now and then , but we both knew it was over .
then what are you doing here in bodega bay?
i wanted to be near mitch .
oh , it was over and done with , and i knew it , but ...
i still wanted to be near him .
i still like him a hell of a lot , and i don't want to lose that friendship ... ever .
hello .
hello .
no , no , no , i wasn't asleep .
yes , just a little while ago .
sure .
hold on .
it's mitch .
for you .
hello?
oh , yes , this is melanie .
fine , thank you .
no , no trouble at all .
i simply followed the road .
well there's no need to apologize .
i can understand
that's very kind of you .
no , i'm not angry .
well , i couldn't .
i have to get back to san francisco .
no , i wouldn't want to disappoint cathy , but
i see .
all right .
yes , i'll be there .
good night , mitch .
he wants me to go to cathy's party tomorrow afternoon .
i said i would .
it should be fun .
i'll be there , too , to help .
oh , it seems so pointless .
well , i think i'll go to sleep .
it's been a busy day .
my luggage .
that's pretty .
where'd you get that?
brinkmeyer's?
mm hmm .
do you think i should go?
well , that's up to you .
no , it's really up to lydia , isn't it?
never mind lydia .
do you want to go?
yes .
then go .
thank you , annie .
oh .
wonder who that can be .
is someone there?
who is it?
look .
poor thing .
probably lost his way in the dark .
but it isn't dark , annie .
there's a full moon .
cathy , that's very good .
very good .
okay .
here we go .
attagirl .
come on .
don't let him get you .
no , i really shouldn't have any more .
i'm driving .
well , actually , i'm trying to get you to stay for dinner .
a lot of roast beef left over .
no , i couldn't possibly .
i ... have to get back .
all right .
cheers .
cheers .
why do you have to rush off?
what's so important in san francisco?
well , i have to get to work tomorrow , for one thing .
you have a job?
i have several jobs .
what do you do?
i do different things on different days .
like what?
well , on mondays and wednesdays , i work for the travelers 'aid at the airport .
helping travelers?
no , misdirecting them .
i thought you could read my character .
on tuesdays , i take a course in general semantics at berkeley ... finding new four letter words .
that's not a job , of course  you mean , you don't have to
and on thursdays , i have my meeting and lunch .
in the underworld , i suppose .
i shall disappoint you .
we're sending a little korean boy through school .
we actually raise money for it .
you see , rome
that entire summer , i did nothing but
well , it was very easy to get lost there .
so when i came back , i thought it was time i began
i don't know finding something again .
so , on mondays and thursdays , i keep myself busy .
what about fridays?
fridays?
they're free .
i sometimes go to bird shops on fridays .
i'm very glad you do .
a nice , innocent , little day .
oh , yes .
i have an aunt tessa .
have you got an aunt tessa?
mm mm .
mine is very prim and straight laced .
i'm giving her a mynah bird when she comes back from europe .
mynah birds talk , you know .
can you see my aunt tessa's face ... when this one tells us one or two of the words i've picked up at berkeley?
you need a mother's care , my child .
not my mother's .
oh , i'm sorry .
what have you got to be sorry about?
my mother?
don't waste your time .
she ditched us when i was 1 1 and ran off with some hotel man in the east .
you know what a mother's love is?
yes , i do .
you mean it's better to be ditched?
no .
i think it's better to be loved .
don't you ever see her?
i don't know where she is .
well , maybe i ought to go join the other children .
all right .
here we go .
one ... two ... three .
there you go .
j ook !
j ook !
hey !
no touching allowed !
oh !
help me get the children into the house .
there you go .
have they gone , mitch?
i think so .
is anyone hurt?
jenny got a scratch down her cheek , but it's nothing .
that makes three times .
mitch , this isn't usual , is it?
the gull when i was in the boat yesterday , the one at annie's last night
last night?
what do you mean?
a gull smashed into annie's front door .
mitch , what's happening?
i i don't know .
do you have to go back to annie's?
no .
i have my things in the car .
stay and have something to eat before you start back .
i'd feel a lot better .
would you like some mustard with that?
no , thank you .
why didn't annie stay?
said something about going home to take a call from her sister .
what's the matter with them?
what's the matter with all the birds?
where did you want this coffee?
here on the table , honey .
hurry up with yours , mitch .
i'm sure miss daniels wants to be on her way .
i think you ought to stay the night , melanie .
we have an extra room upstairs and everything .
that road can be a pretty bad one at night .
if i go across to santa rosa , i'll come out on the freeway much earlier , won't i?
yes , and the freeway is much quicker .
but she'll be hitting all the heavy traffic going back to san francisco .
just listen to those lovebirds .
mitch .
cover your faces !
cover your eyes !
that's a sparrow , all right .
we know what it is , al .
did you have a light burnin 'or somethin '?
yes , but there wouldn't have been that much light going up the chimney .
sometimes birds are attracted by light .
sure is a peculiar thing .
all right , but we've got to do something about it !
i don't think i get you , mitch .
do about what?
well , the birds invaded the house .
what's more likely they got in the room and just panicked .
i'll admit a bird will panic in an enclosed room , but they didn't just get in ; : they came in , right down the chimney .
my wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once .
tell him about the party .
we had a party here this afternoon for cathy , for her birthday .
how old is she?
eleven !
in the middle of the party , some seagulls came down at the children !
miss daniels was attacked by a gull yesterday .
yeah .
were the kids bothering the birds or something?
if you make any kind of a disturbance near them , they'll come after you .
al , the children were playing a game .
those gulls attacked .
now , jydia , " attack " is a pretty strong word , don't you think?
i mean , birds just don't go around attacking people without no reason .
the kids probably scared 'em , that's all .
these birds attacked .
you got quite a mess here , i'll admit that .
maybe you ought to put some screen on top of your chimney .
you want help cleaning up?
no .
i can handle it .
it shouldn't be too much of a job .
i'll take cathy up to bed .
i think i should stay , don't you?
it would be nice if you could .
my things are in the car .
do you want to go with me?
all right .
well , anything else i can do , mitch?
no thanks , al .
we'll be all right .
good night , jydia .
sure is peculiar .
