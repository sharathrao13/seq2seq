you cannot pass !
gandalf !
i'm the servant of the secret fire , wielder of the flame of anor .
go back to the shadow !
you shall not pass !
no !
no !
gandalf !
fly , you fools !
no !
gandalf !
what is it mr. frodo?
nothing .
just a dream .
mordor .
the one place in middle earth we don't want to see any closer .
it's the one place we are trying to get to .
it's just where we can't get .
let's face it mr. frodo .
we're lost .
i don't think gandalf meant for us to come this way .
he didn't mean for a lot of things to happen , sam . ... but they did .
mr. frodo?
it's the ring isn't it?
it's getting heavier .
what food have we got left?
well , let me see .
oh yes , lovely
lembas bread !
and look !
more lembas bread .
i don't usually hold to foreign food , but this elvish stuff is not bad .
nothing ever dampens your spirits , does it sam?
those rainclouds might .
this looks strangely familiar .
that's because we've been here before !
we are going in circles !
ah !
what's that 'orrid stink?
i'll warrant there's a nasty bog nearby .
can you smell it?
yes i can smell it .
we are not alone .
those thieves !
those filthy little thieves !
where is it?
where is it?
they stole it from us
my precious .
curse them !
we hate them !
we want it !
this is sting .
you've seen it before ! haven't you , gollum !
release him or i'll cut your throat !
it burns !
it burns us !
it freezes ..
elves twisted it .
take it off us !
quiet you !
it's hopeless !
every orc in mordor will hear this racket !
let's tie him up and leave him !
no !
that will kill us , kill us !
it's nothing more than you deserve !
maybe he does deserve to die .
now that i've seen him , i do pity him .
we be very nice to hobbits , you be nice to us .
take it off us !
we swear to do what you wants .
we swear !
there is no promise you make that i can trust .
we swear ... ... to serve the master ... ... of the precious .
we swear on ... ... on the precious .
gollum , gollum .
the ring is treacherous .
it will hold you to your word .
yes ... ... on the precious .
on the preciouss .
i don't believe you !
get down !
get down !
sam !
he was trying to trick us !
we let him go he'll throttle us into our sleep !
do you know the way to mordor?
yes .
you've been there before?
yes .
you will lead us to the black gate .
merry !
merry !
what is it?
what do you smell?
man flesh .
aragorn .
they've picked up our trail !
let's go !
their pace quickens .
they must have caught our scent .
hurry !
come on gimli !
three day's and night's pursuit .
no food ... no rest and no sign of our quarry but what bare rock can tell .
not idly do the leaves of lorien fall .
they may yet be alive .
less than a day ahead of us , come !
come gimli !
we are gaining on them .
i'm wasted on cross country .
we dwarves are natural sprinters .
very dangerous we are over short distances .
rohan , home of the horse lords .
there's something strange at work here .
some evil gives speed to these creatures .
sets it's will against us .
legolas !
what does your elf eyes see?
the orcs turn northeast .
they are taking the hobbits to isengard !
saruman .
the world is changing .
who now has the strength to stand against the armies of isengard ... and mordor?
to stand against the might of sauron and saruman ... ... and the union of the two towers?
together , my lord sauron , ... we shall rule this middle earth .
the old world will burn in the fires of industry .
forests will fall .
a new order will rise .
we will drive the machinery of war with the sword ... ... and the spear and the iron fist of the orcs .
we now have only to remove those who oppose us .
the horsemen have taken your lands .
they drove your people into the hills to scratch the living of rocks .
murderers !
take back the lands they stole from you .
burn every village !
it will begin in the rohan .
too long have these peasants stood against you .
but no more .
eothain !
eothain !
take your sister .
you'll go faster with just two .
but papa says eothain must not ride .
he's too big for him !
listen to me !
you must ride to edoras and raise the alarm
do you understand me?
yes mum !
i don't wanna go !
i don't wanna go , mama !
freda , i will find you there .
quickly !
go , child !
rohan , my lord ... ... is ready to fall .
theodred !
your son is badly wounded , my lord .
he was ambushed by orcs .
if we don't defend our country , saruman will take it by force .
that is a lie !
saruman the white has ever been our friend and ally .
grima?
grima?
grima?
orcs are roaming freely across our lands .
unchecked , unchallenged , killing at will .
orcs bearing the white hand of saruman .
why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
can you not see?
your uncle is weary of your malcontent . ... your warmongering .
warmongering?
how long has it been since saruman bought you?
what was the promised price , grima?
when all the men are dead you would take a share of the treasure?
too long have you watched my sister .
too long have you haunted her steps .
you see much , eomer , son of eomund .
too much .
you are banished forthwith from the kingdom of rohan ... ... under pain of death .
keep breathing , that's the key !
breathe !
ho !
they run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them .
we ain't goin 'no further ... ... till we've had a breather .
get the fire going !
merry !
merry !
i think , we might have made a mistake leaving the shire , pippin .
what's making that noise?
it's the trees .
what?
you remember the old forest?
on the borders of buckland?
folks used to say that there was something in the water that made the trees tall ... ... and come alive .
alive?
trees that could whisper ... ... talk to each other ... ... even move .
i'm starving .
we ain't 'ad nothin 'but maggoty bread for three stinkin 'days !
yeah !
why can't we have some meat?
what about them?
they're flesh !
they are not for eating !
what about their legs?
they don't need those .
ooh !
they look tasty !
get back !
just a mouthful?
no !
looks like meat's back on the menu , boys !
pippin !
let's go !
go on , call for help .
squeal !
no one's gonna save you now !
pippin !
a red sun rises .
blood has been spilled this night .
riders of rohan !
what news from the mark?
what business does an elf , a man , and a dwarf have in the riddermark?
speak quickly !
give me your name , horsemaster , and i shall give you mine .
i would cut off your head , dwarf ... ... if it stood but a little higher from the ground .
you would die before your stroke fell !
i'm aragorn , son of arathorn .
this is gimli , son of gloin and legolas from the woodland realm
we are friends of rohan and of theoden , your king .
theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe .
not even his own kin .
saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claim lordship over this land .
my company are those loyal to rohan .
and for that , we are banished .
the white wizard is cunning .
he walks here and there they say ... ... as an old man .
hooded and cloaked .
and everywhere his spies slip past our nets .
we are not spies .
we track a band of uruk hai westward across the plains .
they have taken two of our friends captive .
the uruks are destroyed .
we slaughtered them during the night .
but there were two hobbits .
do you see two hobbits with them?
they will be small .
only children to your eyes .
we left none alive .
we piled the carcasses and burned them .
they are dead?
i am sorry .
hasufel !
arod !
may these horses bear you to better fortune than the former masters .
farewel .
look for your friends , but do not trust to hope .
it has forsaken these lands .
we ride north !
it's one of their little belts .
we failed them .
a hobbit lay here and the other .
they crawled .
their hands were bound .
their bonds were cut .
they ran over here ...
... and were followed .
the belt !
run !
tracks lead away from the battle ...
... into ...
fangorn forest .
fangorn?
what madness drew them there?
did we lose him?
i think we lost him .
i'm gonna rip off both your little heads !
come here !
trees !
climb a tree !
he's gone .
merry !
let's put a maggot hole in your belly .
run , merry !
little orcs !
it's talking merry . the tree is talking .
tree?
i am no tree !
i am an ent .
treeherder !
shepherd of the forest .
don't talk to it merry .
don't encourage it .
treebeard some call me .
and whose side are you on?
side?
i am on nobody's side .... ... because nobody is on my side , little orc .
nobody cares for the woods anymore ..
we are not orcs .
we are hobbits !
hobbits?
never heard of a hobbit before .
sounds like orc mischief to me !
they come with fire they come with axes .
biting , breaking , hacking , burning .
destroyers and usurpers .
curse them !
no !
you don't understand .
we are hobbits !
halflings !
shirefolk !
maybe you are ... ... and maybe you aren't .
the white wizard will know .
white wizard?
saruman !
see , see !
we have led you out !
hurry , hurry !
very lucky we find you .
nice hobbit .
it's a bog !
he's led us into a swamp !
swamp , yes , yes !
come master .
we will take you to safe paths , through the mist .
come hobbits , come .
we move quickly !
i found it .
i did .
the way through the marshes .
orcs don't use it .
orcs don't know it
they go round for miles and miles .
come quickly .
swift and quickly like shadows must be ..
there are dead things !
dead faces in the water !
all dead .
all rotten .
elves and men and orcs .
a great battle long ago .
the dead marshes .
yes , yes !
that is the name .
this way .
don't follow the lights .
careful now !
or hobbits go down to join the dead ones ... ... and light little candles of their own .
frodo !
gollum?
don't follow the lights !
gollum !
mr. frodo !
are you alright?
so bright , so beautiful .
ah precious .
what did you say?
master should be resting .
master need to keep up his strength .
who are you?
musn't ask us it's name not his business .
gollum , gollum .
gandalf told me you were one of the river folk .
cold be heart and rock and bone .
and call every traveller far from home .
he said your life was was a sad story .
they do not see what lies ahead when sun has faded and moon is dead .
you were not so different from a hobbit once ... ... were you ...
smeagol?
what did you call me?
that was your name once , wasn't it?
a long time ago .
my name ..
my name
smeagol .
black riders !
hide !
hide !
hide !
come on frodo , come on !
they will see us !
they will see us
i thought they were dead !
dead?
no , you cannot kill them .
no .
wraiths !
wraiths on wings !
they are calling for it .
they are calling for the precious .
mr. frodo !
it's alright .
i'm here .
hurry , hobbits !
the black gate is very close .
orc blood !
these are strange tracks .
the air is so close here .
this forest is old .
very old .
full of memories ...
... and anger .
the trees are speaking to each other .
gimli !
lower your axe .
aragorn , something is out there !
what do you see?
the white wizard approaches .
do not let him speak .
he will out a spell on us !
we must be quick .
you are tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits .
where are they?
they passed this way the day before yesterday .
they met someone they did not expect .
does that comfort you?
who are you?
show yourself !
it cannot be !
you fell !
through fire .... ... and water .
from the lowest dungeon to the highest peak ... ... i fought him , the balrog of morgoth .
until at last , i threw down my enemy ... ... and smote his ruin upon the mountainside .
darkness took me .... ... and i strayed out of thought and time .
stars wheeled overhead ... ... and each day was as long as a life age of the earth .
but it was not the end .
i felt life in me again .
i've been sent back ... ... until my task is done .
gandalf !
gandalf?
oh yes .
that's what they used to call me .
gandalf the grey .
that was my name .
gandalf !
i am gandalf the white .
and i come back to you now ... ... at the turn of the tide .
one stage of the journey is over , another begins .
war has come to rohan .
we must ride to edoras with all speed .
that is one of the mearas ... ... unless my eyes are cheated by some spell .
shadowfax
he's the lord of all horses ... ... and he's been my friend through many dangers .
my home .
i sleep in the forest here .
the roots of the mountains .
i told gandalf i would keep you safe .
and safe is where i'll keep you .
the trees have gone wild and dangerous .
anger is in their hearts .
they will harm you if they can .
there are too few of us now .
too few of us that are left to manage them .
the black gate of mordor .
my old gaffer have a thing or two to say if he sees this now .
master says show him the way into mordor .
so good smeagol does what master says so .
i did .
we cannot get past them .
look !
the gate , it's opening !
i can see a way down .
sam !
no !
master !
i do not ask you to come with me , sam .
i know , mr. frodo .
i doubt these elvish cloaks will help us in there .
now !
no !
no !
no master !
they catch you !
they catch you .
don't take it to him .
he wants the precious .
always he's looking for it !
and the preciousss is wanting to go back to him .
but we musn't let him have it .
no !
there is another way .
more secret , and dark way .
why haven't you spoke of this before?
because master did not ask !
he is up to something .
are you saying that there is another way to mordor?
yes .
there is a path ... ... and some stairs .
and then ... ... a tunnel .
he has led us this far , sam .
mr. frodo , no !
he's been true to his word .
no !
lead the way , smeagol .
good smeagol always helps .
edoras and the golden hall of meduseld
there dwelts theoden , king of rohan ... whose mind is overthrown ... and saruman's hold over king theoden is now very strong .
my lord , your son ... ... is dead
my lord?
uncle?
will you not go to him?
will you do nothing?
be careful what you say .
do not look for welcome here .
he must have died sometime in the night .
what a tragedy for the king ... ... to lose his only son and heir .
i understand his passing is hard to accept .
especially now that your brother has deserted you .
leave me alone , you snake !
oh , but you are alone .
who knows what you have spoken to the darkness .
the bitter watches of the night ... ... when all your life seems to shrink .
the walls of your bower closing in about you ..
so fair .
so cold .
like a morning pale spring ... ... still clinging to winter's chill .
your words are poison .
this place is as cheerful as a graveyard .
i cannot allow you before theoden king so armed , gandalf grayhame .
by order of grima wormtongue .
your staff .
oh .
no , you would not part an old man from his walking stick?
my lord .
gandalf the grey is coming .
a herald of woe .
the courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late ... ... theoden king .
he is not welcome .
why should i welcome you ... ... gandalf , gandalf stormcrow?
a just question my lord .
late is the hour ... ... in which this conjurer chooses to appear .
lathspell spell i name him .
ill news is an ill guest .
be silence !
keep your forked tongue behind your teeth .
i have not passed through death to bandy crooked words ... ... with a witless worm .
your staff .
i told you to take the wizard's staff !
theoden ... ... son of thengel ... ... too long have you sat in shadows .
i would stay still ... ... if i were you !
i will release you ... ... from the spell .
you have no powers here ... ... gandalf the grey
i'll draw you , saruman , as poison is drawn from a wound .
wait .
if i go , theoden dies .
you did not kill me ... ... you will not kill him .
rohan is mine !
be gone !
i know your face .
eowyn .
eowyn !
gandalf?
breathe the free air again , my friend .
dark my dreams have been of late .
your fingers would remember their old strength better ... ... if they grasped your sword .
i've only .. ... ever served you my lord .
your witchcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast !
send me not from your side !
no my lord !
let him go .
enough blood has been spilled on his account .
get out of my way !
hail , theoden , king !
where is theodred?
where is my son?
simbelmyne .
ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebears .
now it shall cover the grave of my son .
at last , that these evil days should be mine .
the young perish and the old linger .
that i should live ... ... to see the last days of my house .
theodred's death was not of your making .
no parent should have to bury their child .
he was strong in life .
his spirits will find his way to the halls of your fathers .
they had no warning .
they were unarmed .
now the wildmen are moving through westfold .
burning as they go ..
.. every rick and cot .
where's momma?
this is but a taste of the terror that saruman will unleash .
all the more potent for he is driven mad by the fear of sauron .
ride out and meet him head on .
draw him away from the women and children .
you must fight !
you have two thousand good men riding north as we speak .
eomer is loyal to you .
his men will return and fight for their king .
they will be three hundred leagues from here by now .
eomer cannot help us .
i know what is that you want of me .
but i would not bring further death to my people .
i will not risk open war .
open war is upon you , whether you would risk it or not .
when last i looked ... ...
theoden , not aragorn , was king of rohan .
then what is the king's decision?
by order of the king ... ... the city must empty .
we make for the refuge of helm's deep .
do not burden yourself with treasures .
take only what provisions you need .
helm's deep !
they flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight .
who will defend them if not their king?
he is only doing what he thinks is best for his people
helm's deep has saved them in the past .
there is no way out of that of ravine .
theoden is walking into a trap .
he thinks he is leading them to safety .
but what he'll get is a massacre .
theoden has a strong hold but i fear for him .
i fear for the survival of rohan .
he will need you before the end there , aragorn
the people of rohan will need you .
the defenses have to hold .
they will hold .
the grey pilgrim .
that is what they used to call me .
three hundred lives of men have walked this earth and now , i have no time .
good luck .
my search will not be in vain .
look to my coming .
at first light of the fifth day ... ... at dawn , look to the east .
go .
you have some skill with a blade .
women of this country learned long ago that those without swords may still die upon them .
i fear neither death nor pain .
what do you fear my lady?
a cage .
to stay behind bars until use and old age accept them .
and all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire .
you are a daughter of kings .
a shieldmaiden of rohan .
i do not think that will be your fate .
theoden will not stay at edoras .
it is vulnerable .
he knows this .
he will expect an attack on the city .
they will flee to helm's deep ... ... the great fortress of rohan .
it is a dangerous road to take through the mountains .
it will be slow .
they will have women and children with them .
send out your warg riders .
hey stinker !
don't go getting too far ahead !
why do you do that?
what?
call him names .
run him down all the time .
because .
'cause that's what he is , mr. frodo .
there's naught left in 'im but lies and deceit .
it's the ring he wants .
it's all he cares about .
you have no idea what it did to him .
what is still doing to him .
i want to help him sam .
why?
because i have to believe he could come back .
you can't save him , mr. frodo .
what do you know about it?
nothing !
i'm sorry sam .
i don't know why i said that .
i do .
it's the ring .
you can't take your eyes off it .
i've seen you .
you're not eating .
you barely sleep .
it's taking a hold of you mr frodo .
you have to fight it .
i know what i have to do sam .
the ring was entrusted to me
it's my task !
mine !
my own !
can't you hear yourself?
don't you know who you sound like?
we want it .
we need it .
must have the precious .
they stole it from us .
sneaky little hobbitses .
wicked , tricky , filth !
no !
no !
master .
yes .
precious first .
they will cheat you , hurt you , lie !
master's my friend .
you don't have any friends .
nobody likes you .
not listening .
not listening .
you're a liar , and a thief .
no .
murderer !
go away !
go away?
i hate you .
i hate you .
where would you be without me?
gollum !
gollum !
i saved us .
it was me .
we survived because of me .
not anymore .
what did you say?
master looks after us now .
we don't need you .
what?
leave now ... ... and never come back .
no !
leave now and never come back !
leave now and never come back !
we told him to go away !
and away he goes , precious .
gone , gone , gone !
smeagol is free !
look !
look !
see what smeagol finds !
they are young !
they are tender and nice .
yes they are !
eat them .
eat them !
make him sick you will ... ... behaving like that
there's only one way to eat a brace of coneys .
what's he doing !
stupid fat hobbit !
you ruin it !
whats to ruin?
there's hardly any meat on them .
what we need it a few good taters .
what's taters , precious?
what's taters?
po ta toes !
boil them , mash them , stick them in a stew .
lovely big golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish .
even you couldn't say no to that .
oh yes , we could .
spoiling nice fish !
give it to us raw ... ... and wriggling .
you keep nasty chips !
you're hopeless .
mr. frodo?
who are they?
wicked men .
servants of sauron .
they are called to mordor .
the dark one is gathering all armies to him .
it won't be long now .
it will soon be ready .
ready to do what?
to make his war
the last war that will cover all the world in shadow .
we've got to keep moving .
come on sam .
mr. frodo !
look !
it's an oliphant !
no one at home will believe this .
smeagol?
we've lingered here for too long .
come on sam !
ah !
bind their hands .
it's true you don't see many dwarf women .
and in fact , they are so alike in voice and appearance ... .. they are often mistaken for dwarf men .
it's the beards .
and this in turn has given rise ... ... to the belief that there are no dwarf women .
and the dwarves just , spring out of holes in the ground !
which is of course ridiculous .
it's alright !
it's alright !
nobody panic .
that was deliberate .
it was deliberate .
the light of the evenstar does not wax and wane .
it is mine to give to whom i will .
like my heart .
go to sleep .
i am alseep .
this is a dream .
then it is a good dream .
sleep .
you told me once ... ... this day would come .
this is not the end .
it is the beginning .
you must go with frodo .
that is your path .
my path is hidden from me .
it is already laid before your feet .
you cannot falter now .
arwen .
if you trust nothing else ... ... trust this ... ... trust us .
where is she?
the woman who gave you that jewel?
our time here is ending .
arwen's time is ending .
let her go .
let her take the ship into the west .
let her bear away her love for you to the undying lands ... ... there to be ever green .
but never more than a memory .
i will not leave my daughter here to die .
she stays because she still has hope .
she stays for you .
she belongs with her people .
you have a chance for another life ... ... away from war , grief ... despair .
why are you saying this?
i'm mortal .
you are elfkind .
it was a dream arwen .
nothing more .
this belongs to you .
it was a gift .
keep it .
my lord?
she is sailing to the undying lands , with all that is left of her kin .
what is it?
hama?
i'm not sure .
a scout !
what is it?
what do you see?
wargs !
we are under attack !
all riders to the head of the column !
come on , get me up here .
i'm a rider !
you must lead the people to helm's deep and make haste .
i can fight !
no !
you must do this .
for me .
follow me !
