you and greim must go as quickly as possible .
fly to dnitz .
tell him to do anything it takes to punish himmler .
we've decided to die with you .
thank you for this proof of loyalty .
but himmler must die .
he committed treason .
he's no longer privvy to my plans .
mein fhrer?
do you think i'll sit and wait until those jewish swine slaughter me?
this is part of a huge decoy manoeuvre .
i've allowed the enemy ... ... to invade the reich and they think they've won .
but mark my words : they have another thing coming .
dnitz is mobilising in the north .
kesselring in the south .
we'll surround the enemy and crush them .
from prague , three armies will attack the russians , simultaneously , from the back .
i didn't know we still had so many reserve troops .
i made sure you'll soon have a 1000 of the most modern ... ... jets at your disposal .
with those , you can make the luftwaffe ready for battle again .
i kneel to your genius , at the altar of the motherland .
heil , mein fhrer .
you also request to leave berlin?
mein fhrer , as you know , all medical departments ... ... that fall under the ss and himmler , have left berlin .
himmler is a traitor .
he won't escape punishment .
mein fhrer , as reichsarzt ss , i have no more work here .
your request to leave berlin is unacceptable .
my family ...
if the russians ...
i must leave .
you did nothing wrong .
future generations will thank you for you medical research .
i take all the responsibility .
we'll talk about it later .
gruppenfhrer fegelein cannot be found .
he's not in the bunker .
what , you can't find fegelein?
keep searching .
i need to talk to him .
immediately .
if he left just like that , that's desertion .
treason .
bring me fegelein .
fegelein .
fegelein .
daddy , why are you wearing your sunday uniform?
ernst , is something wrong?
no .
thank you .
brigitte is hungry too .
ilse , you should eat something as well .
thank you .
there you go .
thank you .
what is it?
gruppenfhrer , you're under arrest .
what?
you're suspected of desertion .
get dressed .
you'll come with us .
search the room .
let go of me .
you can't give me orders .
you can't have hermann executed , can you?
there's no doubt .
he wanted to flee .
what does it matter?
everything's over .
think of my poor sister .
she's pregnant by hermann .
he collaborated with himmler .
he's a traitor .
there's no mercy for traitors .
no compassion for them .
he'll be court martialled and executed .
what's the point of that?
it is my wish .
you're the fhrer .
speak .
the russians are advancing more and more .
there are no more reserves .
supplies from the air are impossible .
there is no ammunition coming in anymore .
in the north , the russians are standing in front of the weidendammer bridge .
lustgarten .
potsdammer platz .
tiergarten , about 400 metres away from the chancellery .
how long can you hold out?
at most , two days .
including the government area?
yes .
as a soldier , i suggest we flee berlin .
it's surrounded .
the battle of berlin killed about 20, 000 of our best officers .
that's what young people are for .
what you suggest is insane .
ridiculous .
think of the thousands of wounded .
we can't help them .
mein fhrer , the orders have been written .
i give you my word ...
the fhrer cannot make a honourless disappearance from world history .
even if an advance is successful ... ... i'll end up in another troublesome situation .
i'd have to stay in the open air or on a farm ... ... and wait for the end .
wenck is advancing with the 12th army .
he can join the 9th ... ... and give the russians the final blow .
wenck's an excellent fellow .
1 .
where are wenck's vanguard located?
2 .
when will they attack again?
3 .
where is the 9th army?
4 .
where will the 9th make a breakthrough?
you'll see , gentlemen .
i'll be right .
wenck will come .
wenck will come .
i want to know if wenck can do anything at all .
it's unlikely that wenck's small amount of troops ...
what's unlikely about the offensive?
wenck can't do anything anymore .
then why don't you tell the fhrer that?
has everybody gone mad?
do you think the fhrer doesn't know?
he'll never surrender .
and neither will we .
i've been through that once .
never again .
come along .
i have to go .
stop right there .
heil hitler .
excuse me .
i fell asleep .
did you get some rest , my child?
in shorthand .
my political will .
more than 30 years have passed ... ... since i made my contribution as a volunteer ... ... during the first world war .
during those 30 years , i learnt to think , act and live ... ... out of love and loyalty for my people .
excuse me .
the shooting .
please sit down .
centuries will pass ... ... but from the ruins of our cities and monuments ... ... the hatred of the people ... ... who did this to us , will continue to flare up .
international judaism and its allies .
what is it , herr minister?
imagine this .
the fhrer wants me to leave berlin .
he ordered it .
i've never ignored an order from the fhrer .
but i will ignore this order .
i'll stay with the fhrer .
please , frau junge ... ... i want to dictate my will to you .
i'm typing the fhrer's will .
good .
i understand .
some other time .
mein fhrer , are you of aryan descent?
can i see your identity card?
you're talking to the fhrer here .
alright then .
and you , frulein braun , are you of aryan descent?
then there's nothing to stop us .
do you , mein fhrer , adolf hitler ... ... take eva braun , present here , as your wife?
answer 'yes '.
do you , eva braun , take fhrer adolf hitler , present here ... ... as your husband?
answer 'yes '.
then i declare you man and wife .
two men here .
everything will be alright .
you must go to the fhrer right away .
now?
how long can we hold out?
twenty hours , no more .
the russians are close .
at the moment , we forced them to stop .
you know , mohnke .
the western democracies are decadent .
they'll succumb to the people from the east .
all the best .
thank you .
it wasn't just for germany .
a message from keitel .
1 .
wenck's vanguard are stuck south of schwielowsee .
2 .
the 12th army can't continue the attack on berlin .
3 .
the 9th army is completely surrounded .
what do we do when the last ammunition reserves have been exhausted?
i'll never surrender .
never .
i forbid you , and the other commanders , to surrender .
listen , gnsche .
my wife and i are going to commit suicide .
i don't want my corpse exposed by the russians .
i don't want them to get me , dead or alive .
i want to be burnt and never to be found .
gnsche , i want you to promise me ... ... that you will do all that it takes .
mein fhrer ... ... this is a terrible order , but i will execute it .
kempka .
erich , i need 200 litres of petrol .
are you mad?
where should i find them?
from the parked vehicles .
what's all that petrol for?
i can't say .
come , please .
the fhrer wants to see us .
should i tell the fhrer you're indisposed?
it's only my collapsed lung .
i'll die soon anyway .
excuse me .
over here , herr professor .
one moment , please .
excuse me .
i'm sorry to interrupt your important work .
mein fhrer , keep faith in the final victory .
lead us and we shall follow .
come along .
join the gang .
come .
have a drink .
besides drinking , there's little we can do .
do sit down .
that's better .
yes , the situation is pretty shitty .
can we sit down?
please do , frulein ...
frau ...
that's frau hitler .
it's alright .
a pity we can't go outside anymore .
only if you want to die a heroic death .
fritz , control yourself a bit .
yes .
control .
take cover .
what are you doing here?
i have to report to the fhrer .
you can't right now .
sit down .
sit .
drink .
let me introduce frau hitler .
so young and so many decorations .
you must be proud .
excuse me .
i'm not used to drinking anymore .
you can use our toilet .
if your hand shakes , the bullet might only hit an optic nerve .
that's why it's good to also take the poison .
when you bite through the capsule , pull the trigger .
will i have enough time?
the poison starts working after one or two seconds .
tornow , you too .
come blondi .
you know , frau junge , i've known ... my husband for more than 15 years .
but when i think about it , i know nothing about him .
even though he likes to talk .
i longed for berlin , but he's so different now .
he only talks about dogs and vegetarian food now .
i hate blondi .
i sometimes kick her and adolf then wonders why she acts strange .
i think he doesn't want anybody to really know him .
... he can be so caring in his private life .
and then he uses that rude language again .
when he's the fhrer , you mean?
come , let's smoke another one .
i'm sorry .
you have so many worries and here i am , whining .
frau junge , i'm giving you this coat as a goodbye present .
i like fashionable ladies .
i want you to enjoy it .
what a surprise .
thank you .
i just don't know where and when i can wear it .
please , try to get out of here .
promise me .
thank you .
that was very good , frulein manziarly .
the time has come .
it's finished .
the fhrer wants to say goodbye .
come with me .
you're the bravest mother of the reich .
fhrer , you made me the happiest woman in germany .
salute my beautiful bavaria .
children , what are you doing here?
we want to see aunt eva and uncle hitler .
have you eaten anything yet?
only breakfast .
stay here , i'll get something to eat .
i'll be right back .
comrades , this is the latest news from the outside .
there were houses here , there were houses there .
herr gnsche , i want to speak to the fhrer .
please , i have to .
frau goebbels , the fhrer doesn't want to be disturbed .
please , gnsche , just for a moment .
please .
mein fhrer , frau goebbels is here .
what is it?
leave berlin .
don't leave us fhrer .
what will become of us?
tomorrow , i'll be cursed by millions , but that's how it is .
get up .
come .
come .
aunt traudl , i like it when it thunders .
why?
nothing can happen to us here .
can it?
no .
gotcha .
reichsleiter , it's over .
the fhrer is dead .
there's daddy .
are you crazy?
for that damned petrol of yours ...
erich , shut up .
stand back .
come on , continue .
continue .
no , don't .
let grandpa go .
order .
order .
we must have order .
order has to return .
this way .
we know the way .
you can trust us .
hurry .
i was on the side of the red beasts .
i supported the bolsheviks .
let's hope the russians got our message .
we'll soon find out .
or not .
what news do you have , general?
adolf hitler and his wife committed suicide in the bunker .
the new government authorised me ... ... to start peace talks ... ... between our countries , that both suffered severe losses .
general , if you were me , would you make peace with you?
my government will never accept unconditional surrender .
given the situation , you have no other choice .
surrender?
never .
that's shameful .
years ago , i conquered berlin on the reds ... ... and i'll defend the city to my dying day .
in the short time i have as chancellor ... ... i'll never sign a surrender treaty .
it's for the sake of the people .
the fhrer's orders are final .
this is crazy .
we have to start negotiations .
i do not surrender .
send a message to marshal zhukov .
zhukov?
what's happening?
we're surrendering .
then i must kill you .
the fhrer forbids any surrender .
how long does it work?
around four hours .
children , the doctor has the medication i told you about .
it's a bit bitter , but it will work .
a sip for everybody .
who wants to go first?
heide , you're always so brave?
have another sip .
see?
that wasn't so bad .
well done .
helmut .
this medication makes sure you don't get ill in this humid bunker .
but it's not humid in the bunker .
well done .
helga .
i don't want to .
what's that?
do you want to get sick?
please , mama .
i don't want to drink it .
don't cry , baby .
that doesn't help .
you have to drink the medicine .
helga .
come on , open your mouth .
goodnight , children .
one day the lie will fall apart ... ... and there will be light in the darkness .
please read that .
one day the lie will fall apart and there will be light in the darkness .
let's do it differently .
one day the lie will collapse ... ... and truth will triumph once again .
at that moment , we will stand above everybody ... ... pure and ... immaculate .
we don't stand a chance .
so what?
i want to get away .
how do we get through the lines?
doesn't matter .
i'm not staying another minute .
we'll die .
it won't be that bad , surely .
if we stay , the russians will get us for sure .
all the best .
come , let's go .
on 30 april 1945 , the fhrer committed suicide ... ... and in doing so , he deserted everybody who was loyal to him .
you , german soldiers , were loyal to the fhrer and were prepared ... ... to continue the battle for berlin , although ammunition was in short supply ... ... and further resistance was pointless .
i hereby declare an immediate cease fire .
each hour you continue fighting ... ... prolongs the suffering of the people of berlin and of our wounded .
in agreement with the supreme command of the soviet troops ... ... i order you to stop fighting immediately .
weidling , former commander of the berlin defence area .
a glass of water , please .
i don't need you anymore .
the game's over .
it's time .
don't you see what's going on here?
i insist that you help us , as a doctor .
alright , then .
go .
you did a lot .
thank you .
schdle , hurry .
come on .
i'm not going anywhere anymore .
come along .
are you alright?
keep going .
sturmmann krger and his group defended the wolf bridge ... ... and he receives the iron cross .
sturmmann wagner took out two machine gun nests ... ... and therefore , receives the iron cross .
sturmmann rauch has gotten messages through the lines ... ... and receives the iron cross .
the others are coming .
take cover , miler .
who's that?
a german .
herr hewel?
thank god , you're alive .
where are the others?
i don't know , frau junge .
somewhere .
maybe .
most people from my group must be dead .
i should never have left that bunker .
i should have shot myself , but i couldn't .
eat something first .
there's always enough time to die .
you stay with the women .
come along .
the russians have surrounded us .
what's going to happen to us?
maybe you can get through .
you could try .
i'm not taking another step .
think about it .
the russians are after us .
as a woman , you might have a chance .
try it .
good luck .
when you walk past the russians , don't look them in the eyes .
remember that well .
all the best .
the russians .
gerda , let's go .
you go .
i'm exhausted .
please .
i have to give it a try .
don't be angry with me .
i'll be alright .
herr doktor .
my comrades want to surrender .
can i join you?
the fhrer's dead .
do you want to continue the war on your own?
i'm obliged by my oath .
then you'd better go to the brigadefhrer .
the russians are evacuating the square .
so?
no opposition .
no shooting .
then they'll be here within the hour .
what shall we do?
we can't surrender .
what exactly do you mean?
when the russians come , we'll empty our weapons on them .
the last bullets are for ourselves .
that's radical .
is this prestigious murder and suicide our only option?
we're ss officers .
we can't survive the fhrer .
who agrees with me?
come and sit down with me?
please .
why do you want to continue living?
and you?
why do you want to die?
see this?
the fhrer gave it to me personally .
as a last decoration?
maybe .
a goodbye present from hitler .
i had to promise him something .
if the russians get me , i have to kill myself .
did he make you promise that?
but why?
maybe he didn't want me to be forced ... ... to say anything bad about him .
but , as a diplomat , you're under international protection .
who will benefit if you stick to your deal?
there they are .
don't shoot , comrades .
we surrendered .

but i hadn't made the connection with my own past yet .
i reassured myself by thinking i wasn't personally guilty of it .
and that i hadn't known about the sheer size of it .
but one day , i walked past a commemorative plaque ... ... for sophie scholl , here in the franz joseph strasse .
i saw that she was my age ... ... and that she was executed in the year i joined hitler .
and only then did i realise ... that youth is no excuse .
and that it might have been possible to find out the truth .
downfall
