'when i was a little kid ,
'my mother told me not to stare into the sun .
'so once , when i was six , i did .
'the doctors didn't know if my eyes would ever heal .
'i was terrified ,
'alone in that darkness .
'slowly ,
'daylight crept in through the bandages
'and i could see .
'but something else had changed inside me .
'that day i had my first headache . '
jenna , come back here .

hello .
maximillian cohen , please .
yeah?
hi , it's marcy dawson .
i'm a partner at the predictive strategy firm ...
i told you ...
sorry i haven't called .
i hoped we could have lunch tomorrow .
say one o'clock?
max , good .
hey , devi .
i grabbed you some samosas .

no .
jewish mysticism .
look , i'm busy right here .
i understand .
but right now is a very exciting moment in our history .
right now is a critical moment in time .
really?
yeah .
it's very exciting .
have you ever put on tefillin?
you know tefillin?
yeah , i know , it looks strange .
it's an amazing tradition .
it has a tremendous power .
it's a mitzvah jewish men should do .
mitzvahs , good deeds .
they purify us .

hi .
mr cohen?
marcy dawson here again , from lancet percy .
i checked my schedule and i'm in chinatown tomorrow at three .
i'd love to stop by to meet you .
it'll be worth it for us .
how's three sound?
how did you get my address?
i got it from columbia .
three it is .
looking forward to it .
wait a minute ...
max .
stop thinking , max .
just feel .
use your intuition .
what did you think of hamlet?
i didn't get to it .
it's been a month .
you haven't taken a single break .
i'm so close .
have you met the new fish my niece bought me?
i named her lcarus after you , my renegade pupil .
you fly too high , you'll get burnt .
i look at you , i see myself 30 years ago .
my greatest pupil .
published at 16 , phd at 20 .
but life isn't just mathematics , max .
i spent 40 years searching for patterns in pi .
i found nothing .
you found things .
i found things ... but not a pattern .
'not a pattern .
'11 : 22 .
personal note .
'sol died a little when he stopped research on pi .
'it wasn't just the stroke .
'he stopped caring .
'how could he stop ,
'when he was so close to seeing pi for what it really is?
'how could you stop believing that there is a pattern ,
'an ordered shape behind those numbers , when you were so close?
'we see the simplicity of the circle ,
'we see the maddening complexity of the endless numbers ,

# i don't mind if we're in a ... #
hey , max .
lenny meyer .
i'll put it out .
so ...
what do you do?
i work with computers .
math .
math?
what kind of math?
number theory .
research mostly .
no way .
i work with numbers myself .
i mean , not traditional .
i work with the torah .
amazing !
hebrew is all math .
it's all numbers .
you know that?
look .
ancient jews used hebrew as their numerical system .
each letter's a number .
the hebrew a , aleph , is 1 .
b , bet , is 2 .
understand?
but look , the numbers are interrelated .
take the hebrew for father , ab .
aleph , bet .
1 , 2 equals 3 .
the word for mother , haim .
aleph , mem .
1 , 40 equals 41 .
the sum of 3 and 41 , 44 .
right?
now , the hebrew word for child mother , father , child .
yelev .
that's 10 , 30 and 4 .
44 .
torah is just a long string of numbers .
some say that it's a code , sent to us from god .
that's kind of interesting .
that's kid's stuff , check this out .
the garden of eden , kadem .
numerical translation , 144 .
the value of tree of knowledge , in the garden .
right?
aat ha haim .
2 , 33 .
1 , 44 .
2 , 33 .
you can take those numbers ...
those are fibonacci numbers .
they're ...?
you know , like the fibonacci sequence?
fibonacci?
fibonacci is an ltalian mathematician in the 13th .
if you divide 144 into 233 ,
the result approaches theta .
theta?
theta .
the greek symbol for the golden ratio , the golden spiral .
wow .
i never saw that before .
that's like that series you find in nature?
like the face of a sunflower?
wherever there are spirals .
see , there's math everywhere .
hey , i ...

i lost all my data , hardware .
your mainframe?
burnt .
what ...
what's happened?
first , i get these crazy low picks , then it spit out this string of numbers .
i never saw anything like it .
and then it fries .
it crashed .
you have a print out?
of what?
of the picks , the number?
i threw it out .
what number did it spit out?
i don't know , a string of digits .
how many?
i don't know .
what is it , 100 , 1 , 000 , 216?
how many?
probably around 200 .
why?
i dealt with some bugs back in my pi days .
i wondered if it was like one i ran into .
have you met archimedes?
the one with black spots .
see?
you remember archimedes of syracuse?
eh?
the king asks archimedes to determine if a present he has received is actually solid gold .
unsolved problem at the time .
it tortures the great greek mathematician for weeks .
insomnia haunts him and he twists and turns in his bed for nights on end .
finally , his equally exhausted wife , forced to share a bed with this genius , convinces him to take a bath , to relax .
while he's entering the tub , he notices the bath water rise .
displacement a way to determine volume , and thus a way to determine density .
weight over volume .
and thus archimedes solves the problem .
he screams " eureka ! " and he is so overwhelmed , he runs naked through the streets to the king's palace to report his discovery .
now , what is the moral of the story?
that a breakthrough will come .
wrong !
the point of the story is the wife .
listen to your wife , she'll give you perspective .
meaning , you need a break .
you must take a bath or you'll get nowhere .
there will be no order , only chaos .
go home , max , and you take a bath .
excuse me .
can i take a look at the paper?
oh , my god .
six and a half .
hey ...
hey !
the paper , please .
mr cohen?
perfect timing .
i was going to head home .
who are you?
marcy dawson .
we were meeting .
it's really not ...
it's such a pleasure to finally meet you .
i studied your paper ...
excuse me .
let's take my car .
i can't .
mr cohen ...
yes !
i just threw out something .
i didn't realise i needed it .
just a print out .
i lost my data .
whoa !
i'm sorry .
max .
how're you doing?
lenny meyer .
where you going?
up there .
you got five minutes?
do you wanna try tefillin?
not now .
i've a car to go to the shul .
you got a car?
that's my friend , ephraim .
let's go .
great .
when you said you're max cohen ,
i didn't realise you were the max cohen .
your work's revolutionary .
it's inspired the work we do .
it has?
very much so .
the only difference is , we're not looking at the stock market .
go ahead .
wrap that round your hand .
we're searching for a pattern in the torah .
what kind?
we're not sure .
all we know is it's 216 digits long .
ok , stand up , please , max .
216?
that's right .
you've gotta be quiet now .
stand up .
216?
shh .
this goes on your head .
look at me , max .
right here .
there you go .
all right .
now , we'll say a prayer together .
shma yisroel .
shma yisroel .

adenoi eloihenu .
adenoi eloihenu .
adenoi echod .
adenoi echod .
now , what's up , max?
what is this 216 number , sol?
excuse me?
you asked me if i'd seen a 216 digit number .
oh , yeah .
you mean the bug .
i ran into it working on pi .
what do you mean ran into it?
max , what's this about?
there are these religious jews i've been talking to .
religious jews?
yeah , hasids , the guys with beards .
i know them .
i know one in a coffee shop .
he's a number theorist .
the torah is his data set .
he says they're after a 216 digit number in the torah .
come on , it's just coincidence .
there's something else , though .
what?
you remember those weird stock picks?
yesterday's stock picks?
yes .
they were correct .
i got two picks on the nose .
smack on the nose , sol .
something's going on .
it has to do with that number .
there's an answer in it .
max ...
come with me .
the ancient japanese considered the go board to be a microcosm of the universe .
although , when it's empty , it appears simple and ordered , the possibilities of gameplay are endless .
no two go games are alike , just like snowflakes .
so , the go board actually represents an extremely complex and chaotic universe .
and that's the truth of our world , max .
it can't be easily summed up with math .
there is no simple pattern .
but as the game progresses , the possibilities become smaller .
the board takes on order .
soon , every move's predictable .
so?
so maybe , even though we're not aware of it , there is a pattern , an order underlying every go game .
maybe it's like the pattern in the stock market?
the torah?
this 216 number?
it's insanity .
maybe it's genius .
i must get that number .
hold on !
you're losing it .
you have to breathe .
listen to yourself .
you're connecting my computer bug with one you might've had and some religious hogwash .
if you want the number 216 , you can find it everywhere .
216 steps from your street corner to your front door , 216 seconds you spend in the elevator
when your mind becomes obsessed you filter everything else out and find that thing everywhere .
320 , 450 , 22 , whatever .
you've chosen 216 and you'll find it everywhere in nature .
but , max , as soon as you discard scientific rigour , you are no longer a mathematician , you're a numerologist .
mr cohen?
mr cohen ...
god damn it !
i'm sick of you following me .
i'm not interested in money .
i want to understand our world .
i don't deal with materialists like you .
i'm sorry .
i'm very sorry .
i admit we've been too aggressive .
but all i ask is that you give me five minutes .
as a token , accept this .
i don't want your money .
the suitcase isn't filled with 50s , or gold , or diamonds .

they're not even de classified yet .
you're right , they're not .
but lancet percy has many friends .
beautiful , isn't it?
do you know how rare these are?
what do you ...?

no .

new evidence .
'remember pythagoras .
'mathematician , cult leader .
athens , circa 500 bc .
the universe is made of numbers .
'the golden ratio .
'best represented geometrically as the golden rectangle .
'visually , there exists a graceful equilibrium
'between its length and width .
'when it's squared , it leaves a smaller golden rectangle behind ,
'with the same unique ratio .
'the squaring can continue , smaller and smaller ,
'to infinity .
'11 : 18 .
more evidence .
'remember da vinci .
artist , inventor , sculptor , naturalist .
'ltaly , c15th .
'rediscovered the perfection of the golden rectangle
'and pencilled it into his masterpieces .
'connecting a curve through the concentric golden rectangles ,
'you generate the mythical golden spiral .
'pythagoras loved this shape , for he found it in nature
'a nautilus shell , rams 'horns , whirlpools , tornadoes ,
'our fingerprints , our dna and even our milky way .

personal note .
'when i was a little kid ,
'my mother told me not to stare into the sun .
'so once , i did .
'at first , the brightness was overwhelming ,
'but i kept looking , forcing myself not to blink .
'and then the brightness began to dissolve .
'my pupils shrank to pinholes and everything came into focus .
'and for a moment i understood .
'my new hypothesis : if we're built from spirals ,
'while living in a giant spiral ,
'then everything we do is infused with the spiral .

'personal note .
'it's fair to say i'm stepping out on a limb .
'but i'm on the edge where it happens . '
'i'm happy you ... '
look , what do you want in exchange for the chip?
you tech 'guys .
i think you know what we want .
i may not find anything .
we'll take the risk .
first , i want you to call off the surveillance .
done .
anything else?
yeah , i'm a very private person .
just knock on my door and leave the suitcase outside .
i don't wanna talk to anybody .
how do i know you're home?
i'll knock back .
the torah .
coffee .
what is it?
in hebrew , characters and numbers .
no , the 216 number .
what is it?
i don't know .
if you can find it , maybe we can figure it out .
can you really find it?
if it's there , i'll find it .

you were screaming .
who said you could put locks on the door , mr cohen?
are you ok?
you're out , you hear me?

seven and an eighth .
twelve and a quarter .
i know these numbers .
they're going down ... down ... down .
you lied to me .
you have it?
ok , sit down .
i gave up before i pinpointed it , but my guess is that , er , certain problems cause computers to get stuck in a loop .
the loop leads to meltdown , but just before they crash they become aware of their own structure .
the computer has a sense of its own silicon nature and it prints out its ingredients .
the computer becomes conscious?
in ...
in , er ... some ways ...
i guess .
studying the pattern made euclid conscious of itself .
it died spitting out the number .
consciousness is the number?
no , max .
it's only a nasty bug .
it's more than that .
no .
it's a dead end !
there's nothing there !
it's a door , sol .
a door .
a door to a cliff , you're driving yourself over the edge .
you need to stop .
you were afraid .
that's why you quit .
i got burnt .
come on .
it caused my stroke !
that's bullshit !
it's mathematics , numbers , ideas .
mathematicians should go to the edge .
you taught me that .
it's death !
you can't tell me what it is .
you've retreated to your go and books and goldfish .
max , go home .
you're not satisfied .
go home .
get out ...
i'm gonna see it !
get out !
i'm gonna understand it .

didn't your mother ever tell you not to play with matches?
the market's going to crash .
i didn't do anything .
i don't play the market .
be careful where you throw out your trash .
how could you do that?
you gave faulty information .
you dangled the carrot , but only gave us part of the code .
now give us the rest to set it right .
you bastards !
how could you be so stupid?
max , you just don't get it .
i don't give a shit about you , just what's in your head !

we've been looking for you .
what's going on?
you have the number?
what's going on?
what is it?
what're you doing?
get off of me !
where's the number?
it's not on me .
it's in my head .
you memorised it?
did you give it to them?
who?
those wall street bastards .
what do you care?
answer me .
listen .
this is really big .
i don't wanna hurt you .
did you give it to them?
they've got part of it .
let go !
damn it !
they're using it .
using what?
shut up !
impetuous little runt !
let go !
no , don't !
max .
max .
max .
max .
you're all right .
i'm rabbi cohen .
cohen , like you .
i'm sorry for what lenny did .
he's been reprimanded .
it's not our way .
are you ok?
yeah .
max , you have to give us the number .
what is it?
the talmud tells us it began 2, 000 years ago , when the romans destroyed the second temple .
what is this?
max , you'll understand if you listen .
the romans also destroyed our priesthood , the cohanim .
and with their deaths , they destroyed our greatest secret .
in the centre of the temple was the heart of jewish life , the holy of holies .
it was the earthly residence of our god .
the one god .
it housed the ark of the tabernacle , which stored the original 10 commandments which god gave to moses .
only one man was allowed to enter this holy of holies on one day , the holiest day of the year , yom kippur .
on the day of atonement , all of lsrael would descend upon jerusalem to watch the high priest , the cohen godul , make his trip to the holy of holies .
if the high priest was pure , he would emerge moments later and we'd have a prosperous year .
it meant we were one year closer to the messianic age .
but , if he was impure , he would die instantly and it meant we were doomed .
the high priest had one ritual to perform there .
he had to intone a single word .
yeah?
that word was the true name of god .
so?
the true name , which only the cohanim knew , was 216 letters long .
are you telling me that ...
that the number in my head is the true name of god .
yes !
it's the key to the messianic age .
it will take us closer to the garden of eden .
as the temple burnt , the talmud tells us the high priest walked into the flames .
he took the key to the top of the building , the heavens opened and received the key from the priest's outstretched hand .
we have been looking for that key ever since .
and you may have found it .
that's what happened .
i saw god .
no .
you are not pure .
you cannot see god unless you are pure .
no ...
i saw everything .
you saw nothing , only a glimpse .
there's so much more .
we can unlock the door and show god we're pure again .
you're not pure .
how are you pure?
i found it !
who do you think you are?
you are only a vessel from god .
you're carrying a delivery meant for us !
it was given to me .
it's inside of me .
it's changing me .
it's killing you !
because you are not ready to receive it .
it's just a number .
i'm sure you've written down every 216 digit number .
you've translated all of them .
you've intoned them all .
haven't you?
what's it gotten you?
the number is nothing .
it's the meaning .
the syntax .
it's what's between the numbers .
you haven't understood it .
it's because it's not for you .
i've got it .
i've got it !
i understand it .
and i'm gonna see it .
rabbi , i was chosen .
