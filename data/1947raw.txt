a very long engagement
saturday the 6th of january , 1917 , five condemned soldiers were escorted to bouchavesnes at the front in the somme .
watch out for the wire !
the first , once cheerful and adventurous , wore the tag number 2124 .
he was drafted from the seine area .
on his feet were boots , taken from a dead german .
before becoming 2124 , he was known as bastoche and was hooked on a pretty redhead , a certain vronique passavant .
he was a carpenter .
taking a break from his woodwork , they'd go for a beer at little louis 'bar , in golden hand st.
he'd taken his boots from an enemy who no longer needed them .
stuffed with straw or newspaper , they replaced his old clodhoppers .
he was court martialed for self mutilation .
gunpowder had been found on his wounded hand .
he faced the death sentence .
watch out for the wire !
the second soldier was tag number 4077 , also from near the seine .
he was a welder for the state railways , in bagneux .
his name was francis gaignard , nicknamed six sous .
he knew the poor build the canons of their own destruction , but it's the rich who sell them .
he tried to explain it to the troops , but he wasn't a good speaker .
and cheap wine , poverty's best friend , deadened the soldiers 'eyes , making it difficult to get through to them .
number 1818 was surely the bravest and the toughest of them all .
he had once killed a fellow officer ... an officer who kicked the dead .
get up !
you swines !
you lazy cowards !
you !
get up !
attack !
attack !
you !
get going !
no one ever found out .
benot notre dame was a farmer from dordogne .
one august morning , they came to get him at his farm and sent him off on a train .
watch out for the wire !
the telephone wire is the only link to the land of the living .
a flimsy wire , their only chance for president poincar's pardon .
even if the only one to still believe in it is him .
number 7328 , recruited in corsica .
angel bassignano .
according to all who'd known him , he was no angel at all .
he was a liar , a cheat , a show off , a sneak and a troublemaker .
before all this ,
tina lombardi worked as his whore .
he'd received a 5 year sentence for an affair of either love or honour , depending on who he was talking to .
it was , in fact , a conflict between village pimps .
summer 1916 , common law criminals were enlisted to beef up regiments melted in the fires at verdun .
they gave him the choice .
it's been shitting shells round here !
no , it's been rather quiet .
who are those for?
well , actually ... you'll be attacking tomorrow .
we're getting a head start .
watch out for the wire !
the fifth was a " cornflower " , the nickname for the class of '17 .
he was five months shy of 20 .
these days , everything scared him .
french canons short firing , the wind that heralded the mustard gas attacks , executions to set an example .
he hadn't been like that before , quite the opposite , braving storms as he helped lighthouse keepers .
and then came one shell too many .
there you go ...
the winning ticket back to your fiance .
the ticket for a court martial .
turn a blind eye , sarge .
he's been through enough .
they could execute him .
be human for once .
shut up !
please , sarge !
shut up !
the first time mathilde and manech made love , he fell asleep , his hand on her breast .
each time his wound throbs ,
manech feels mathilde's heart in his palm .
each beat brings her closer to him .
if manech were dead , mathilde would know .
since the death notice , she stubbornly holds on to her intuition , like to a flimsy wire .
she never gets discouraged .
and mathilde is of a cheerful disposition .
if that wire doesn't lead her to her lover , never mind ... she can always use it as a noose .
in june 1920 , mathilde received a letter from a nun .
a patient at the rennes hospital wants to see her .
he'd met manech in january '17 at the front in the somme .
august 1912 .
handsome , wasn't i?
it's a de dion , with direct drive .
please , tell me about manech .
in january '17 ,
i escorted five condemned soldiers .
he was one of them ...
yes .
i was to take them to a front line trench .
gendarmes were waiting with the prisoners near a bombed out cemetery .
what are you doing with those german boots?
waiting .
what for?
poincar's pardon?
you'll wait !
he'll sign it !
i shouldn't even have been condemned .
i'm corsican , not french !
leave him be .
he's lost it , but that's for the best .
finished , lieutenant?
the cold has saved that one .
gangrene would've got him in summer .
and manech?
was he in pain?
they had to cut off two fingers , but he wasn't suffering anymore .
i led them to a trench , called " bingo crpuscule " .
bloody hell !
couldn't you have lost them on your way?
a kick in the ass to get rid of them !
my orders are to bring you these five .
and i'll tell you my orders !
i'm to throw these guys over the top and leave them to die like dogs between our line and the jerries '!
those are my damned orders , sergeant !
you see , sergeant , with the jerries ,
it's a little too calm?
let's start the fireworks and watch all hell let loose !
soup , guys !
you're lucky , it's still warm .
beetroot and fennel .
what can i get for you?
a large hot chocolate and some bread with honey .
i'd kill my parents to get you that !
do you mind , lieutenant?
he's an orphan !
he'll get it .
clestin poux is the " mess hall marauder " , the " kitchen raider " .
fifteen minutes later , he came back with it all .
salted gurande butter ,
lavender honey , and ... cocoa from nigeria !
grand ...
tell me , cornflower , you've no one to write to?
a fiance?
mathilde .
her name is mathilde .
i hear her heart beating , like morse code .
we're engaged .
luckily , we won't have to wait till the end of the war .
now i can go straight home after the execution .
should i spare you the rest?
i'm lame , not dim .
what happened?
we opened the barbed wire and equipped the five against the cold .
clestin poux gave up a red woolen glove to protect your fianc's hand .
are they far?
too far for grenades , too near for artillery .
gas is out of the question .
the gasser always gets it !
think they'll make it?
if they're not blown to bits , they'll starve and freeze .
either way , it'll amuse the jerries .
a corporal gave bastoche , the carpenter , a hug .
it was corporal gordes .
they clearly knew each other before the war .
and then , over they went .
shit ...
shut up .
shit !
shut up !
september '14 .
150 pound weight , easy !
and i wasn't at my best !
but that morning , in january '17 , was manech still alive?
at dawn , favart called out their names .
apart from the dordogne farmer , they all replied .
bassignano !
sir !
bouquet !
what now?
langonnet !
yeah , still here !
the cornflower , hide yourself better .
notre dame !
that's all i know .
i wrote up my report with a heavy heart .
about time , esperanza !
the brits are replacing us , we're off .
so , bingo thingy?
what's that?
the condemned prisoners 'list , signed by capt. favourier .
give it to me .
don't just stand there like that .
this isn't pompeii !
you've been promoted .
you're off to the vosges .
even so , sir , this expedition is going to be hard to swallow .
lucky you .
where you're going , there's mustard gas and throat lozenges .
the famous vosges sweets .
dismissed !
a few months later , i was wounded , in the somme .
i ended up in the same ambulance as chardolot , a corporal from bingo crpuscule .
but he only had a few days left to live .
it's me .
esperanza .
bingo crpuscule , remember?
sorry , i don't recognize you .
the five thrown over into no man's land , what happened to them?
what do you think?
no one made it .
your conscience bothering you , esperanza?
you should've stuck around .
you'd have seen capital ms , underwear being waved and a flying albatross .
you're delirious with fever !
we sent over five men and recovered five stiffs .
conclusion ...
my eyes are gone but i can imagine your expression and i like it .
he really spoke of capital ms and an albatross?
and underwear .
here you go , miss .
in here are the prisoners 'belongings i was to return to their families .
my health's prevented it .
that's the letter the dordogne farmer , notre dame , wrote to his wife .
i sent the original just after bingo .
you're here because of the mustard gas?
not even .
damned spanish flu !
death moves in mysterious ways .
if you can't cry , try talking .
if you can't talk , say nothing .
but sometimes , talking can bring on the tears .
tears say what you can't say , if you get my drift?
otherwise , you can just keep that sour face !
little louis , tell vro i'm thinking of her .
shame she won't talk to me .
saw biscuit , we patched things up .
adieu , my friend .
bastoche .
benot notre dame , number 1818 .
i won't be writing for a long time .
tell old bernay i want to settle up by march .
his manure's too costly , watch out for him .
tell my baptistin that i so love that he'll be fine if he listens to his dear mother .
she's the kindest person i know .
love you .
benot .
for tina lombardi , from angel bassignano .
if chickpea comes in before dinner's called , manech is alive .
i'm not hungry .
dinner's ready .
mathilde , dinner !
coming !
mathilde was born the 1 st of january , 1900 .
it's easy for calculating her age .
in 1903 , her parents died in the n 44 bus accident .
since then ,
mathilde often says to herself ,
ashes to ashes , dust to dust !
ashes to ashes , dust to dust ...
her uncle and aunt ,
sylvain and bndicte , have raised her , with her parents 'life insurance invested by pierre marie rouvire .
when she was five , mathilde came down with polio .
she was bedridden for months , despite mustard compresses ... pendulums and four leaf clover infusions .
today , mathilde is twenty .
she plays the tuba .
it is the only instrument capable of imitating a distress call .
chickpea , the dog , farts in his sleep .
when she hears it , bndicte never fails to say ,
doggie fart , gladdens my heart .
mathilde needs daily treatment .
since the armistice , georges cornu , a swimming champion , massages her .
she used to get embarrassed , but she got over it .
mathilde sometimes imagines that georges admires her , tormented with desire .
what's more , he once said ,
you do have a fine figure , miss .
and i've kneaded quite a few .
after that , how should she call him?
dear georges ...
my dear georges ...
jojo ...
sometimes , before falling asleep , she imagines herself in arousing situations .
mathilde doesn't need to fantasize for very long before reaching fulfilment .
since his disappearance , she can't bear to think about her fianc as she satisfies herself .
that's the way it is ...
if i were you , mathilde , i'd forget him .
why chase pipe dreams?
if he was alive , you'd have heard from him .
he was taken prisoner .
and stayed with a german girl with braids and big boobs !
a breton boy eating sauerkraut !
lmpossible !
can i help?
keep your feet on the ground .
i stand on my own two feet !
what?
never mind .
i heard you anyway .
but your dreams don't stand up .
manech can't have been taken at bingo .
our men took the trench facing it .
normally , it's the winners who take prisoners .
so he's lost his mind .
or he's in hiding , to avoid hard labour .
stop dreaming , mathilde !
face up to it .
you'll find a husband , despite ...
something's off key .
i'll find the " mess hall marauder " , clestin poux .
what can i get for you?
or the corsican's whore .
she might know more than me .
tomorrow , i go to paris .
what for?
to find a survivor from bingo crpuscule .
germain pire , private detective the peerless pry
i'm used to handling red hot affairs .
i've a cupboard full .
scandals that would've been brushed under the carpet ... brought to light by pire's prying .
take this big affair ... very delicate .
in '17 , a train derails .
425 soldiers on leave , dead .
the enquiry reveals how an officer ordered the departure , despite faulty brakes .
a total cover up by poincar's government .
the victims 'families only hope of finding the officer?
germain pire !
the peerless pry .
peerless , miss .
i found their officer , to the military's great displeasure .
granted , he was dead and buried .
i'll just pack my bags and be on my way to track down poux clestin and the corsican's fiance .
and your fees , mr. peerless pry?
the pry only bleeds dry sitting ducks , miss .
for you , i can do ... 20 francs a day .
plus expenses , of course .
why so kind?
hlne , come and say hello .
don't worry about expenses .
germain pire eats little , doesn't drink and tips sparingly .
notre dame de paris?
not notre dame de paris !
i'm calling from paris about notre dame benot !
benot notre dame !
a strapping , good hearted farmer .
died for his country .
i've lost many a parishioner .
are his wife and baptistin still there?
quiet !
miss minet , i can't hear a thing !
no .
she upped and left one day , with no forwarding address .
is that a choir i hear?
of course , it's a choir !
we are in a church , miss !
but that's no hymn at your end !
thank you , father .
goodbye .
bingo crpuscule !
i can't make head nor tail of it !
i thought you liked defending lost causes .
your impertinence was charming at 10 , not at 20 !
then start taking me seriously .
you're wasting your money on a grotesque crusade !
bingo crpuscule !
why not yippee doodle doo?
i want access to army archives .
let's say there's an ounce of truth in this .
if one man has survived , he risks hard labour !
and you know it !
your prying would put him in great danger !
be reasonable .
your parents entrusted me ...
ashes to ashes ...
that's just it .
they entrusted you with my happiness .
goodbye .
thank you , pierre marie .
don't be like that , my dear mathilde .
i'm thinking of your future .
sorry to see your health's worsened , despite the massages .
i'll see what i can do .
it doesn't only happen in lourdes !
i'm looking for tina lombardi .
i knew her when she was little ...
ladies , i'm tina lombardi's uncle and i'd like to know ...
excuse me ...
i look after the lombardi family's interests and i'm looking for tina .
she's come into some money .
you're the one looking for tina lombardi?
well , actually ...
ever been to corsica?
very pretty , very picturesque .
but tina's walking the street somewhere else .
luckily , a highly placed member of the police picked up her trail in bar le duc .
valentina emilia maria lombardi , aka tina , was registered in 1916 near the 23rd regiment's camp of marseilles .
since the armistice , the chick has flown the coop !
i've lost her trail , but i've been busy .
she's disappeared into thin air .
so , you're giving up .
not at all .
pire never admits defeat .
pire is stubborn .
pire's peer doesn't exist .
perfect !
thank you .
just a little bit .
not my eyes .
careful with that !
what can i get you?
this is my fianc .
and him , the carpenter ...
i think you know him .
my throat's dry .
" good glass of wine ...
" keeps the doctor in line .
my great aunt's motto .
died in 1911 in besancon , she was 99 .
never sick a day ...
good luck .
touch wood .
the war?
a hyena in the botanical gardens .
i was showing off , stroking it .
bastoche and biscuit made this .
biscuit?
his best friend .
they met in 1910 during the floods , saving a lady's life .
bastoche was talented but biscuit ... a genius .
a magician with a chisel !
he pegged all the articulations .
this is for you .
louis , tell vro i'm thinking of her .
shame she won't talk to me .
saw biscuit , we patched things up .
adieu , my friend .
bastoche .
to patch things up means they'd argued .
you know why?
a mystery .
they went through hell together , the marne , the wovre , the somme ...
then one day , and who knows why , they stopped talking .
biscuit was transferred .
he died in a military hospital bombing .
i'm glad they finally patched things up .
they won't be queuing up outside , today .
pour me one?
she's thirsty !
a wooden hand , a heart of gold .
to love .
true love !
but who was vro?
vronique passavant .
his regular , his woman .
they often came in together .
why would they have argued?
he may have strayed and she wouldn't forgive him .
there you go .
'17 , this way .
what exactly are the red files?
secret defence .
you need a mandate from someone high up .
of course , they're upstairs !
go and help him .
let's say you were someone high up ... then you could give us the mandate .
if i thought like that , i wouldn't be an officer .
consider yourself lucky you've been allowed in .
it usually takes months .
it looks tidy but it's really a mess .
so , the somme ...
the bouchavesnes sector , trench 108 .
what a state ...
look at this .
appalling !
may i help?
thank you for replying favourably to the general ...
we're very good friends .
bouchavesnes ... two friends of mine died there .
dreadful , the battles in that trench ...
paris wasn't much better .
couldn't even find a taxi after the opera .
so i heard !
we'd like information on trench 108 .
posting slips , trenches 104 , 105 .
trench 107 .
where's 106?
trench 108 .
how annoying , it's written on both sides !
trench 108 .
dug by the germans , taken by us in 1916 and renamed
bingo crpuscule .
why not yippee doodle doo?
january 6th , nothing to report .
the 7th , heavy combat with losses .
capt. favourier , history teacher .
lt benot estrangin , insurance agent .
corporal ...
strange .
certain losses are filed confidential .
confidential?
you mean ...
sorry .
can't you ...
sorry , we can't look any further .
not even the general .
please .
thank you for the time you've taken .
you're welcome .
nothing here of interest .
posting slips , commissary bills .
the routine .
i assumed as much .
it was to be expected .
you've gone too far !
i do hope this paper wasn't filed secret defence !
you must tell me if it's important .
it's nothing .
just a leave .
from the president?
that's right .
president poincar sometimes granted a leave to a deserving soldier .
end of story !
i'll see you out .
corporal bouquet klber ...
corporal gaignard francis ...
private notre dame benot ...
private bassignano angel ...
private langonnet manech ...
for self mutilation , you are sentenced to death .
lf , before the count of 7 , the train hasn't entered the tunnel , or the ticket inspector hasn't come ,
manech is dead !
1 , 2 , 3 ,
4 , 5 , 6 ...
ticket , please !
april fool !
when the newspaper strike is over , we can place your ad .
reward for information concerning bingo crpuscule .
encouraging her won't bring back her appetite .
take her to the quimper fair .
what for?
a change of scenery .
you might meet a nice boy .
what for?
to get married and have children .
tell her !
can you pour me one?
you drink now?
glass of wine keeps the doctor in line .
where's that from?
dead hand barman with a wooden hand .
his aunt's motto .
died at a hundred , in besancon , 1911 .
repeat that?
in besancon , in 1911 , a 99 year old lady left behind a wooden handed nephew , owner of the dead hand bar , in golden hand st , to whom she often said what sylvain just asked me .
she's already drunk !
look !
an albatross is stubborn .
he knows he can outlast the wind .
hey , my gravel !
my gravel !
vronique passavant , 17th of july , 1920 .
i'm writing from little louis 'bar .
he told me about you .
i must tell you about an encounter which left me quite shaken up .
i headed for bastoche's workshop .
i was feeling down .
i want to talk to bastoche .
bastoche?
he died .
at the front in the somme .
didn't you know?
i know something else .
what?
from the hospital , where i care for dying syphilitics , a patient sends you this .
if you don't want to die , covered with oozing sores , answer me !
the comrade hiding with your bastoche ...
tell me ... tell me he's corsican .
i was already traumatized by nuns when i was little !
tina lombardi knows something we don't .
what?
the lombardi girl ... she knows something we don't .
that would prove bastoche had escaped .
with another condemned prisoner .
that hussy obviously thinks it's her angel .
but if bastoche had escaped , he'd have looked out for manech .
if he escaped ...
give me that .
with " ifs " , a flea could carry an elephant .
maybe .
but without " ifs " , might as well hang myself .
thanks to you , i spend my time picking gravel out of the lawn !
when i see gravel , i make it a point of arriving in style .
for the miss .
leprince hardware , paris , 25th of july , 1920 .
sunday lends itself to writing .
i'm replying regarding
clestin poux and other survivors from bingo crpuscule .
i knew the fellow .
the smartest thief i ever met .
thanks to him , i never went without !
olivier nergeton , animated toys .
clestin poux was our salvation , aka the mess hall marauder or justa bit more .
he falsified losses , making up numbers to give double rations .
if you should see him , tell him we'll never forget him .
etienne morillon , teacher , 3rd of august , 1920 .
he always had us laughing .
he had even trained the company's mascot for us !
good morning .
what weather !
germain pire , private detective .
mathilde has spoken of you .
sylvain !
tell mathilde to come down .
that mr. pry is here to see her .
poux's been hopping around .
two days in dreux , then troyes , castre , five days in ste .
it'll take luck and patience to land him .
too bad .
hlne , some savoury biscuits .
taste them .
tell me what you think .
the kitchen's more comfortable .
thank you , bndicte .
i'll leave you .
poux can't stay in one place , whereas tina lombardi ... she's got us running in circles .
i know .
and she's the queen of disguise .
anything new on biscuit?
that's benjamin gordes .
the day he won the carpentry prize for the sixth consecutive year .
that's right .
biscuit ,
bastoche's best friend , is none other than benjamin gordes .
a soldier from their company said they were like brothers before it went sour .
why won't you tell me?
stop it !
tell me !
i don't want to fight you , so stop it !
why won't you talk?
whose idea was it?
mine?
no , it was your idea !
bastard !
it was his idea !
all because of a woman !
vronique passavant finished with bastoche in june '16 .
and just after , he fought like a mad dog with benjamin gordes .
don't need to be pythagoras !
they didn't meet again before bingo crpuscule?
where it all ended !
no , where it all begins , mr. pire .
where it all begins ...
tina lombardi is sure bastoche is alive .
what made him different from the others that evening?
he was the only carpenter?
something made bastoche different from the others .
his german boots !
he was the only one with german boots !
of course .
you're right !
tina lombardi's discovered that a man with german boots survived !
i bet he was seen with a comrade !
i saw two soldiers who looked like tramps .
one wore boots taken from a jerry .
he was holding up the other .
we also know bastoche had patched things up with his best friend !
exactly !
did it change the course of events that night?
if i don't break the peel ,
gordes managed to save bastoche and manech .
i'm never going to get that pie in the oven !
i must go back to paris .
i must go back to paris .
again?
that money's going up in smoke .
ashes to ashes ...
pilot fish !
excuse me , elodie gordes?
over there , selling carrots .
thank you .
never seen him !
which one don't you know?
him , by any chance?
why did bastoche and biscuit argue?
was it over you?
i have nothing to say !
i want to know !
leave me alone !
they last met at bingo crpuscule .
my fianc was also there .
with bastoche .
in that shithole of a trench !
i want to understand .
i want to understand !
it's not what you think .
i can't talk about it .
give me your address .
my spelling's terrible but i'll explain it all in a letter .
i promise .
go ahead !
my gravel !
nothing for me?
what?
nothing for me?
just the newspaper .
they talk about everything except elodie gordes .
very funny !
you should read it , one can learn things !
has the president opened an inquest on bingo crpuscule?
he might have done , if he hadn't fallen from a train in his pyjamas .
well , he wears pyjamas !
he wears pyjamas !
we recovered five stiffs .
conclusion ...
we knew you were a thief .
but a pyromaniac?
all for me?
no .
just this one .
if i'm not picking up gravel , i'm picking up the postman !
the gravel's gone?
a fair fight .
fighting is never fair .
can i offer you a short one?
won't say no .
miss , i beg you to keep my secret to yourself .
when i met my husband , he already had four children .
none were his .
out of kindness , he'd married a widow with tb .
she was polish , like me .
he adopted her children before her death .
i was also an unmarried mother .
he then found himself the father of five , though he couldn't have any of his own .
you're going to run me over !
we had four years of tenderness .
we had plans .
we dreamt of seeing the sea together .
then the war came .
i thought bastoche would take care of him , their being posted together .
but during his leave , in september , 1915 , just after the battle of artois ,
i knew nothing would ever be the same .
over there , it's all we have to keep going .
once , in a burning field , i saw some comrades ...
their cartridge belts exploded like fireworks .
once , we even had to use the body of a friend as a shield .
there had been something on his mind .
he came out with it on the second night .
if i desert , the gendarmes will come and get me .
my only way out is to have a sixth child .
if you have six children , they send you home .
as i said , he couldn't have children .
i didn't dare think what was on his mind , but he just wouldn't let it go .
it's not betrayal if i'm asking you .
especially if it's with bastoche .
don't touch !
the five aren't mine , so why not a sixth?
you'd have nine months to wait .
the war will be over by then .
it will never be over .
never !
they'd be nine months of hope .
have you no heart?
and then one day , i found a note from klber bouquet , known as bastoche , saying to tie a coloured cloth at the window if he wasn't to come up .
coffee?
i'd love some !
after you .
please .
thank you .
sugar?
no , thank you .
it's mother of pearl?
yes , benjamin made it .
it's odd ...
how strange we never met .
the children aren't here?
yes , but ... they're playing outside .
a pick me up?
please .
no , no ...
sorry .
i don't fancy one .
neither do i.
elodie , we'll say we've done it .
it'll calm him down .
it will make things easier for you , for me ... for everybody .
funny how your smile opens the parentheses .
i'll close them as late as possible ...
in two days , at the train station .
come on ... give me one last smile .
to close the parentheses .
i didn't even get pregnant !
but soon , fear no longer tormented my husband .
it was jealousy .
where?
when?
often?
which positions?
did you enjoy it? " it became a living hell for both of us .
now , bastoche is dead , as you know , and my husband was killed in a hospital bombing .
it's a relief to confide in you .
at times , i think i'm going mad .
elodie gordes .
matti !
hurry up .
mr. rouvire is on the phone .
he's waiting .
come on !
mathilde?
pierre marie here .
i have some bad news .
not really bad ...
news you're already supposed to know .
but news you can no longer ignore .
you were right about one thing ...
manech and his four comrades were in that absurdly named trench .
they were buried in the herdelin cemetery , after being temporarily buried under a tarpaulin in a bomb crater .
that's that , my dear mathilde .
in june , 1909 , mathilde is 9 years old .
manech langonnet is 10 .
does it hurt when you walk?
it's friday , or saturday ...
mathilde can't remember .
do you have any friends?
i can be your friend .
do i stink of fish?
ever been to the top of the lighthouse?
i can carry you to the top of the stairs .
because my dad's the keeper !
be stuck up then !
church mouse !
country bumpkin !
do you want a kick in the pants?
can you see far from the top?
i'm going to gobble up your ears !
i'll throw you in the dungeon !
i am the squid's servant !
doggie fart , gladdens my heart !
manech's marrying mathilde !
mathilde's marrying manech !
i don't smoke .
i know , but take it ...
it'll help you make new friends .
if i reach the bend before the car ,
manech will come back alive !
if i reach the bend ...
if i reach the bend before the car ...
manech will come back alive ...
if i reach the bend ...
you used to brag about being one year older than me .
now i'm older than you .
the man who gave you his glove is called poux .
clestin poux .
funny , isn't it?
the man i hired to find him is pire .
germain pire .
strange name , too .
either way , he hasn't found him .
nor the corsican's whore .
the wire's snapped , manech , but i'm not giving up .
i still believe that tina lombardi's a lead .
i need to be sure .
you understand , right?
that's why i must find clestin poux .
you can be really annoying , you know .
we would be so much better in brittany .
let's go , mathilde .
you'll catch cold .
thouvenel !
what do you want?
who are you?
was it you who phoned?
who are you?
the days go by .
still no news of clestin poux .
mathilde's sadness is overwhelming .
she must eat .
she's making herself ill .
leave her the marrowbone .
her sadness is beginning to rub off on us .
and so , in the middle of the night on the 15th of september , 1920 , the wire is re tied .
victory !
i've finally found the roaming poux .
sent by the grace of god and davidson motors .
all expenses paid , of course .
germain pire .
clestin poux , terror of the tarmac !
the ad was yours?
mathilde tightly clasps her hands , to keep from shaking and crying and making a fool of herself .
i didn't actually see your fianc get hit .
i went to get the stew and ran into lebgue , a guy i met in the vosges .
a native of the meuse .
or rather a nave of the meuse .
even so , he could tell good coffee from a stomach remedy .
i know .
i tried to sell him a mixture of coffee and charcoal in exchange for some dutch tobacco .
so , the last time you saw manech , he was alive?
you couldn't miss him .
carving ms on a burnt tree trunk , smack in the middle of no man's land .
he carved three ms before the albatross got him .
albatross !
albatross .
great sweeping sea bird ,
indolent traveling companion ,
gliding with ships
upon bitter deep .
it's a poem by baudelaire .
it was also a jerry bomber .
the machine gun was at the rear .
we couldn't shoot yet through the propeller .
it was you who gave him the glove?
a thick woolen red one .
my fiance spent her time knitting scarves and mittens for me .
i traded them with frostbitten senegalese in exchange for germans 'gold teeth .
i melted them down after the armistice .
they paid for my harley .
but ... are you sure manech's dead?
a comrade told me , with a wound like that ... he didn't stand a chance .
i only saw three of them get killed with my own eyes .
i surrender !
i surrender !
don't shoot !
i beg you !
i surrender !
let me through !
i'm on your side !
i'm not french , i'm corsican !
i've nothing against you !
poor bastard .
so , he's not french !
let's cancel his birth certificate .
a french corporal dealt with him ...
thouvenel .
a trigger happy swine !
he had a heart made of stone , but a sharp eye .
poor bastard !
i guess you like it .
i'd kill my parents for a good stew !
don't worry , he's an orphan .
the same goes for truffles .
if you like truffles , i have one from prigord ...
which ones did you see die?
the one with gangrene .
six sous .
yes , the welder .
comrades ...
before dying ...
i have a final request .
i want to piss standing up .
like a man !
and then , you can fire away to your heart's content !
so long to life , so long to love
so long to all those women
it's all over
done forever
this shameful war
at craonne , on the plateau
that's where we'll leave our skins
for we've all been sentenced
we are the sacrificed
and bastoche?
he was so well hidden , we couldn't locate him .
even at dawn , when he answered roll call , no one knew where he was .
a ventriloquist !
no , he was a carpenter .
no matter .
he was shot down by the albatross , along with your fianc .
the albatross caught fire and crashed on the enemy line .
return to sender .
what about the dordogne farmer?
he played dead from the beginning .
not that it saved him .
the jerries didn't appreciate the grenade .
don't look !
lt'll only make it worse .
when i got back with the stew , bullets were flying everywhere .
heavy shelling had begun .
damn !
no one can imagine what it's like .
can't move your legs , your heart beats like a scared animal .
then i saw the dordogne farmer shatter into pieces .
attack , before we're all slaughtered .
prepare bayonets !
all that was nothing compared to what followed .
for france !
charge !
we'd passed the five prisoners bodies when the jerry machine guns started spitting bullets .
we were wiped out !
that lavrouye bastard !
he kept the paper to himself .
stretcher bearers !
what paper?
that's all he said .
that evening , there was enough food to feed an army .
favart and chardolot were counting losses .
why do those five show up on our battalion list?
we're only following orders .
something stinks here .
something stinks?
lavrouye stinks .
this food doesn't .
dig in before it gets cold .
it's cold !
so you only saw three of them get killed .
with your own eyes .
false hope will only make you suffer .
they're not false !
you'll taste my cake?
i don't know if i should .
with a bit of fresh cream .
if you insist ...
i like people who appreciate my food .
i'll put her to bed .
let's all get some sleep .
slow down !
you lack control , no style ...
you're better at raking than skidding !
hey , postman !
i'll drop you off at the next letterbox .
and my bike?
leave it to me .
i fought in the war !
i don't have a desk job .
it's not my fault .
i'm asthmatic !
an asthmatic who rides a bike !
by the sea .
sure , by the sea !
clestin , it's not a sidecar .
those men , they never grow up ...
as long as they don't play soldiers .
tell old bernay ... settle up by march .
his manure's too costly ...
he wouldn't write such trivialities .
don't you agree?
there must be a code .
except lovers 'codes can't be cracked with brains or divine intervention .
and bastoche?
if he was seen with his german boots , he must have survived .
not so , miss .
gordes didn't let him go over the top with those boots .
if the jerries see these , they'll know you've stripped one of their dead .
so tina lombardi's on the wrong track .
the one with the boots wasn't bastoche .
it was gordes !
that's right , miss !
he was with a boy , from the class of '17 ...
desrochelles .
i'd met some stretcher bearers who'd just passed them .
are you from bingo?
might be .
tell them gordes is wounded .
he's with a boy who's worse off .
desrochelles .
they're off to first aid .
with german boots !
long live anarchy !
anarchy .
what's happened , matti?
what did i say?
open up !
be reasonable .
what did you do?
nothing .
you've known he's dead for three years .
i call that stubbornness .
no , i call that hope .
poux has just killed it .
if i can do anything ...
you can .
take me to bingo crpuscule .
an indian princess on her elephant .
with her hunters , on the trail of sorrow .
it was there !
right there !
at a hundred yards , facing bingo , was erlangen , the jerry trench .
where's the burnt tree trunk?
all the stumps and debris were used to fill in the trenches .
we found the five over there , under a tarpaulin , covered with earth .
not a pretty sight .
no doubt !
the youngest was only a boy .
was he wearing a glove?
a red , woolen glove?
they all had one bandaged hand , but ... nothing on the other .
i can't remember seeing a glove .
athos !
i don't like him digging like that .
around here , you never know what junk you might come across , that can blow off an arm or a leg .
it's the crypt !
there was a chapel between the two trenches .
it was in ruins .
incredible .
i don't recognize a thing .
could manech have lost the glove as he fell?
it was tightly knitted and tightly fitted .
i used the other one in the kitchens until the end of the war .
maybe he took it off to carve?
i couldn't say .
but i don't think so .
what sort of red was it?
bright red?
a flashy red .
with white dots .
looked like maggots on an apple !
sorry to disturb you like this .
my husband's family suffered greatly in the war .
i didn't want to go over to a french soldier's table in front of him .
what can you tell me?
before dying , my brother gunther saw your fianc carve those three letters on a tree .
he was wearing a red , spotted glove .
a comrade of gunther's told me the story .
when our plane shot down your fianc , they were sick to the stomach .
after that , it was a nightmare .
god spared that french soldier twice .
then ... your side attacked .
they killed my brother .
he was 23 years old .
i came to see his cross at the cemetery .
i'm sorry .
time heals all .
you'll see .
i'll get back , he'll be getting worried .
seems i haven't killed it .
pardon?
hope !
what now?
tina lombardi .
she's going to the guillotine !
they call her the " officer killer " .
she's killed lavrouye and thouvenel .
and planned to kill marchal ptain .
when i think you sat in a wheelchair to soften me up !
i'll talk only to you , because i know we're very similar .
we'll leave them alone .
what i did , you could've done , too .
i don't think so .
i'd be too scared .
i'm not scared .
and i regret nothing .
except my hair .
i'll be treated to a bowl cut before the execution .
i'll look like joan of arc when i see my angel !
why did you want to kill ptain?
throwing mutilated soldiers over the top was his idea .
why not poincar?
he refused them a pardon .
you don't know?
he did pardon them .
all five !
it's just a leave .
lavrouye kept the paper for himself .
why did that dog lavrouye do that?
because dirty dogs play dirty .
that's all .
trust me on this .
i took care of him !
you and i have been running the same investigation .
each in our own way .
looking for survivors from bingo ,
i picked up a male nurse who'd treated angel and the others .
this guy , phillipot , was sure he'd seen one of them .
a big man , with a head wound .
he was a big man .
head wound , german boots ...
he wore german boots and was carrying a thin built soldier .
i think that's about right .
i'm even sure of it .
a big man , head wound ...
his superior told him to keep his mouth shut .
you can imagine how overwhelmed with hope i was .
and then , i met the man who shattered my dreams .
chief sergeant favart .
he told me how that pig thouvenel had shot my angel , just like that !
like taking a leak .
i took care of him , too !
it was an obsession .
kill all those who hurt my man .
your angel left you this .
vengeance is pointless .
try to be happy ,
and don't ruin your life for me .
your angel from hell .
departure for paris , platform 2 .
gordes , the one who switched boots with bastoche ... was he big?
biscuit?
he was no athlete .
just a guy like you or me .
and you have no news of desrochelles?
he didn't make friends easily .
he lived alone with his mother .
i must go .
i'm boarding in an hour for venezuela .
good luck , clestin !
to you too !
when i think you hid poincar's pardon !
i didn't want to throw salt on the wound .
i'd like one last favour .
i suppose it concerns bingo thingy?
son of bookseller , desrochelles paul , born in sarreguemines , died in february , 1897 ...
that's it , desrochelles jean !
what?
in saintes .
in the charentes .
tell me , mr. pire , tina lombardi ...
you had an inkling of what she was up to .
luckily , your paths didn't cross .
he who pries , flies , when danger lurks .
he who pries , pries , but , from a distance .
i've a new lead for you .
jean desrochelles .
evacuated from the front on the 7th of january '17 .
his only next of kin was his mother , the widow desrochelles .
she lives at 22 rue de i'abbaye .
saintes , in the charentes .
all the work's been done !
you've tried to reach me?
my brother's comrade , the one i told you about ...
he remembered something that might interest you .
the two french soldiers escorting him that morning , wanted to go back through no man's land .
they saw the prisoners 'bodies .
one was in a kind of small cellar .
the french soldiers seemed surprised .
i don't know if that can help you .
thank you .
tell old bernay i want to settle up by march .
his manure's too costly , watch out for him .
his manure's too costly ...
there must be a code .
your mr. pry called !
he's run into a dead end in saintes .
i know !
hello !
go ahead .
yes , miss .
i remember you .
old bernay?
no , never heard of him .
benot notre dame used the manure from his animals .
he never bought it !
thank you , father .
i must decode this letter .
i think we're getting hot .
will be bernay march
sell everything
say nothing
listen no one
benot
excuse me , the " end of the world " farm?
the last house at the end of the road .
and if he doesn't come?
he'll come , don't worry .
come back in two hours .
hello , mathilde .
it's dangerous to want to bring back the dead .
when i saw your ad in the paper ,
i knew , in time , the gendarmes would come .
don't worry .
i had the chance to do away with you ...
i let it go .
we knew you were a thief .
but a pyromaniac?
i couldn't kill you .
now , even the rabbits and chickens , my wife has to do it .
the war's taken it out of me .
you know what i want to hear .
is he alive?
the last time i saw him , he wasn't doing well .
but he's stronger than he looks .
don't stay together .
when things calmed down , i tried to get some sleep .
gaignard !
you think we're at the whorehouse?
bouquet !
what now?
notre dame?
then the pimp tried to surrender .
and the welder from paris was killed .
your fianc started carving on the tree .
then , the jerries 'albatross arrived .
i came to , when the ground started shaking .
i don't know what happened .
i just saw that trapdoor the shell had half opened .
for france !
charge !
they entered no man's land .
at the second german line , the machine guns got them .
a few hours later , a voice woke me .
my god !
bastoche is dead !
we can't leave him here .
we'll come back .
he's not going anywhere .
bastoche is dead .
look , this one's still moving .
it's the cornflower .
he's a goner as well .
a shell had ripped the door off .
one of the guys arrived , in bad shape .
bastoche is dead !
we're all going to die .
i recognized bastoche's friend .
the one who'd taken his german boots .
after eating , i smoked his tobacco .
then , i heard more voices .
let's go look over there .
look here !
damn it !
it's not the cornflower .
what's he doing in there?
where's the dordogne farmer?
i'm cold .
don't worry .
he was really messed up , but your fianc wanted to live .
i saw it in his eyes .
i put him on my shoulders and set off through the trench .
he was burning with fever .
i felt the heat on my back .
and he was delirious .
spoke of a heart beating in his hand .
hey , corporal !
only 500 yards to the hospital .
want us to put your friend on the stretcher?
no , thanks .
if you see any officers from bingo , tell them corporal gordes has gone to the hospital with desrochelles .
have it your way !
i arrived just before the explosion .
headquarters had the good idea of setting up hospital in a hangar containing a hydrogen packed zeppelin .
the cornflower has just been evacuated .
will he make it?
his hip wound isn't too bad .
but he has a severe case of pneumonia .
you're both registered according to your tag numbers .
i don't want to know anything else .
but good luck anyway !
block the pulley !
please !
after that , i walked to bernay .
i had no idea if my wife had received my letter , so each day i waited for her at the bus stop .
with the money from the sale , we bought a farm here .
the most isolated one we could find .
they call it " the end of the world " .
that's it .
goodbye .
how strange .
you shot a hole right through your lifeline .
of course .
i died .
at bingo crpuscule , like your fianc .
if ever you find jean desrochelles alive somewhere ,
let me know .
you know where to find me .
make yourself at home !
at christmas , come down the chimney !
for miss mathilde .
i'll give it to her later .
if i were you ...
i would wake her up .
what is it?
he's alive .
stay where you are , mathilde .
just stay where you are .
i'm on my way .
germain pire .
how silly i am !
peerless on the prowl , faster than a whippet !
he's well and truly alive , but he's lost his memory !
total amnesia .
he even had to learn to read and write again .
the psychiatrists treating him since '17 aren't hopeful .
but who knows?
there are as many amnesias as amnesiacs .
where is he?
in milly la fort .
orphaned for the second time .
he's just lost his adopted mother .
pierre marie , do you know mr. pire?
by reputation .
an honour .
mathilde , i'll believe it when i see it .
with my own eyes !
when jean desrochelles was born , his mother was 40 , and had no other children .
when the gendarmes took him ...
to replenish the troops in ardennes .
she became depressed .
one day , a comrade of her son visited her ...
chardolot !
unfortunately , it was jean .
a shell had got him .
he'd already been dead for a few hours .
i should also tell you ...
maybe the youngest prisoner has taken jean's identity ... exchanging tag numbers .
she went off her rocker the day the hospital rang her , asking to come to her son's bedside .
he's sleeping .
i'll leave you .
who are you?
your mother , my darling .
i'm your mother .
i ran my own little investigation .
mrs. desrochelles died two months ago .
run over by a truck after a fight with a shopkeeper .
and i'm not guessing !
it's in the report .
we already knew that .
don't get upset .
mrs. desrochelles didn't suffer , she died straight away .
it's not that .
i feel so guilty !
i didn't believe you , my dear mathilde !
i should have known !
i'm so sorry .
in what she would refer to as her " milly expedition " , the sun , the sky and nature are with her .
as a true lady , she made every effort to look her best .
dressed in white for freshness ,
lipstick for the occasion , eyebrows shaped .
but none of that black which lengthens the eyelashes .
she knows that tears can make a mess of it .
he knows about your visit .
we said a young girl he'd dearly loved was coming here .
he asked your name and found it very beautiful .
he's in the garden .
he's waiting for you .
does it hurt when you walk?
want to see what i'm doing?
i'll show you later , when it's finished .
but why are you crying?
mathilde leans back against her chair , folds her hands in her lap and looks at him .
in the sweetness of the air , in the light of the garden ,
mathilde looks at him .
she looks at him ...
she looks at him ...
