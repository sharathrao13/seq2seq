on your knees .
lower .
i am jerusalem .
do you , reynald will give me the kiss of peace?
guard !
what are you looking at?
a dead man .
reynald de chatillon , you're arrested .
if you continue like this , i shall have to find the use for you .
if god could spare you that is .
god does not know me .
yes , but i do .
i need you in jerusalem .
why did we retire?
why?
god did not favour it .
god determined the results of battles .
the results of battles are determined by god .
but also by preparation , numbers , the absence of disease and the aviability of force .
why he cannot maintain us seizure with the enemy behind?
how many battles did god win before i came?
that is , before god had determined that i should come .
that's because we were sent for .
it is because you were unprepared .
if you think that , you shall not be king for long .
when i'm not king , i quit for us .
thank you for your visit .
thank you for your visit .
you promised .
you promised to return jerusalem .
don't forget .
so my friend , the time has come to conclude my affairs .
we have decided that you shall take command of the army of jerusalem .
if i leave the army with guy , he will take power through my sister and make war on the muslims .
whatever you ask , i will serve .
no , hear it all before you answer .
would you marry my sister sybilla were she free of guy de lusignan?
and guy?
he will be executed .
along with his knights who do not swear your religions .
i cannot be because of that .
whatever you ask i will serve .
the king may move a man , you said .
but the soul belongs to the man .
yes i did .
you have my love and my answer .
so be it .
why do you protect guy?
he's a man who insults you , hates you .
will kill you himself if he had a chance .
but for the salvation of this kingdom , will it be so hard to marry sibyila?
jerusalem has no need of a perfect knight .
no .
it is a kingdom of conscience or nothing .
sibyila .
who are you to refuse a king?
i am what i am .
i offer you that .
and the world .
you say no .
do you think i'm like guy?
that i would sell my soul?
there'll be a day , when you will wish you have done a little evil to do a greater good .
my lord .
do you really think the king wants you head of the army once he's gone?
you think your wife does?
i have a problem .
ah yes , balian .
i saw him at kerak .
celebrated .
kill him .
ah , hello .
i was dreaming .
about that summer .
when i defeated saladhudin .
do you remember it?
i was only 16 .
you were a beautiful boy .
yes .
you've always been beautiful .
my beautiful sister .
so beautiful .
i'm sorry i've got you through this .
remember me as i was?
i will .
sibyila .
if i have your nights , you have your wife .
behold your rightful queen and heir to the throne to the kingdom of jerusalem .
i , sybilla by the grace of the holy spirit choose the king guy de lusignan , the man who's been my husband .
with the help of god he will rule his people well .
long live the king in prosperity .
long live the king !
is this why you came to the holy land?
come on !
leave us .
the king is in heaven?
yes .
and the templar's king balian?
yes .
reynald , give me a war .
that is what i do .
i am what i am .
someone has to be .
saladhudin's sister .
i know .
i know .
speak .
the sultan demands the return of his sister's body .
the heads of those responsible .
and the surrender of jerusalem .
does he?
what answer do you return to saladhudin?
this .
take the head to damascus .
i am jerusalem .
assemble the army !
now this assembly of barons and all jerusalem is complete .
there are those among you who may disagree with our succession , but it is war !
and i am ... the king .
we march at once .
what say this council?
no .
if you must have war , this army cannot move away from water .
you have a chance to hold the city .
but if you move out against saladhudin , this army will be destroyed .
and the city left defenseless .
when i wish of blacksmith to advise on war , i will tell it .
saladhudin wants you to come out .
he is waiting for you to make that mistake .
he knows his men .
we should reach the enemies of god !
so we shall .
and you do so without my knights .
then i will have the glory , tiberias .
you had yours years and years ago .
it's time for mine .
tiberias .
when saladin is finished with guy , he will come .
we must look to the defenses .
the king is dead .
and jerusalem along with him .
you go with the army?
my order is with the army .
you go to certain death .
all death is certain .
i shall tell your father what i've seen you become .
when saladhudin comes , we do not defense upon .
save the people from a dying time .
i will .
god with it .
can you sense it?
there's been my messenger .
i drink water for what it is .
i did not give the cup to you .
no , my lord .
a king does not kill a king .
why you're not close enough to a great king?
to learn by his example .
i've given jerusalem my whole life .
everything .
first i thought we're fighting for god , then i realized we're fighting for wealth and land .
i was ashamed .
tiberias .
there is no more jerusalem .
i shall go to cyprus , will you come with me?
no .
you are your father's son .
saladin has moved his army from water to water .
not within four days , maybe five .
god be with you .
he's no longer with me .
mark four hundred .
four hundred !
four hundred !
they are here .
it is only one man .
no , they're here .
this is the only section of the wall they can attack .
once they begin to bomb all the walls , they will stop only to avoid these narrow siege towers as they come in .
you take the bombardment .
when they seize firing , we fire .
we must leave the city !
how exactly my lord we shall?
the fastest horses we can get .
and the people?
that is unfortunate about the people , but it is god's will .
quiet !
it is fallen to us , to defend jerusalem .
and we have made our preparations as well as they can be made .
none of us took this city from muslims !
no muslim of the great army now coming against us was born when this city was lost .
we fight over an offence we did not give .
against those who were not alive to be offended .
what is jerusalem?
your holy places lie over the jewish temples that the romans pulled down !
the muslim place is a worship , high over yours .
which is more homy?
the wool?
the musk?
this applica?
who has claim?
no one has claim .
all have claim !
that is blasphemy !
be quiet .
we defend this city not to protect these stones , but the people living within these walls !
my lord !
my lord , my lord .
how we're to defend jerusalem without knights?
we have no knights !
truly .
what is your condition?
i'm servant to the patria .
that is so .
one of my servants .
is he?
you were born a servant?
kneel .
every man in arms who capable of bearing them , kneel !
on your knees !
be without fear in the face of your enemies .
be brave and upright that god may thee .
speak the truth even if it leads to your death .
save god the helpless .
that is your oath .
and that so you remember it .
rise a knight !
rise a knight !
who do you think you are?
beyond the world?
does making a man a knight make him a better fighter?
yes .
only god gives victory .
my lord?
no .
god be with us !
when will it begin?
soon .
water !
bring water !
forth !
why don't they fight back?
they wait .
that was only the first day .
it may be a hundred more .
saladin will show no mercy .
we must do well .
force him to offer terms .
what terms?
we fight for the people .
their safety and freedom .
mercy .
no , i cannot .
four hundred !
fire !
three hundred !
fire !
one fifty !
hold your fire !
hold !
fire !
pour out !
now !
fire !
who defends?
balian of ibelin .
the son of godfrey .
godfrey?
godfrey nearly killed me in another one .
truly , i did not know he had a son .
it was his son at kerak .
the one you let live .
yes .
perhaps you should not have .
perhaps i should have had a different teacher .
fire !
when a body is burnt , it cannot be resurrected until the judgement day .
if we do not burn these bodies , we will all be dead of disease in three days .
god will understand , my lord .
and if he doesn't , then he is not god .
and we need not worry .
the wall , where the entrance gate used to be has been weak .
it's usually when the gate is blocked in , it is weaker than the wall around it .
or stronger .
it is weaker , rashid has seen it .
this will be our door into jerusalem .
this wall will make us down .
we must prepare .
brothers !
brothers !
god has sent you this day !
you did not listen as they did !
when this wall comes down ,
there will be no quarter .
if you throw down your arms , your families will die .
we can break this army here !
so i say let them come !
let them come !
come on !
come on !
come on !
they will ask for terms .
they must ask for terms .
convert to islam , repent later .
you've taught me a lot about religion , reverence .
when you leave the city?
before i lose it , i will burn it to the ground .
your holy place is ours .
every last thing in jerusalem that drives men mad .
i wonder if it will not be better if you did .
you will destroy it?
every stone .
and every christian knight you kill will take ten saracens with him .
you will destroy your army here and never raise another .
i swear to god that to take this city will be the end of you .
your city is full of women and children .
if my army will die , so will your city .
you offer terms , i ask none .
i will give every soul safe conduct to christian lands .
every soul .
the women , the children , the old and all your knights and soldiers and your queen .
no one will be hurt .
i swear to god .
the christians butchered every muslim within the walls when they took this city .
i am not those men .
i am saladhudin .
saladhudin .
then under these terms i surrender jerusalem .
and peace be with you .
what is jerusalem worth?
nothing .
everything .
i had surrendered jerusalem .
all will be safely escorted to the sea .
if this is the kingdom of heaven ,
let god do with it as he wills .
your brother's kingdom was here .
and here .
that kingdom can never be surrendered .
what should i do?
i'm still the queen of accra , escalon .
decide not to be a queen .
and i will come to you .
this horse .
it is not a very good horse .
i will not keep it .
thank you .
and if god does not love you , how could you have done all the things that you have done?
peace be with you .
a queen never walks .
and yet you are walking .
we crusades are to come to the kingdom of jerusalem .
you go to where the men speak italian .
and then continue until they speak something else .
we've come by this road to find balian , who was defender of jerusalem .
i am the blacksmith .
and i am the king of england .
i am the blacksmith .
the king , richard the lionheart , went on to the holy land and crusaded for three years .
his struggle to regain jerusalem ended in an uneasy truce with saladin .
nearly a thousand years later , peace in the kingdom of heaven remains elusive .
