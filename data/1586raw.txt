is there something that strikes you as odd about this?
it's like there's a pattern to the way they're not talking ... ... the way they say " no " all the time .
i think it's odd .
mrs. hambling?
yes !
we're from the washington post .
i'm carl bernstein , this is bob woodward .
a friend of the committee said that we could contact you .
who was it?
we can't reveal that .
you can talk to us .
we don't reveal our sources .
you people ....
you think you can come into my home , ask a few questions ... ... have me destroy the reputations of men that i work for and respect?
do you understand loyalty?
have you ever heard of loyalty?
hi .
yes?
i'm bob woodward .
carl bernstein .
we're from the washington post .
yes !
i've read what you've written .
i want to thank you .
i've been a republican all my life , but this goes beyond party politics .
would you mind if we asked you a few questions?
no , no .
come in .
would you like coffee?
sure .
what they've done is a threat to the constitution .
it goes against everything we stand for .
could you be a little more specific than that?
i'm afraid your articles have just scratched the surface .
do you mind if i just take a few notes?
no .
how long have you worked at the committee?
committee?
yes , the committee to re elect the president .
oh , no , i don't work at the committee to re elect the president .
i work at garfinkel's , in the accounting department .
miss abbott?
yes .
judith abbott?
caroline abbott .
we're just doing something wrong .
never been there .
we're doing something wrong .
it's just not good enough .
how can you keep going at something past the point when you believe in it?
just have to start all over again .
nason , narrow , ness ... ... nickels , nixon ....
ed nixon .
jolson , jones ... ... jordan , jost .
if we could only get somebody that worked for finance to talk .
i can't believe it .
what about the bookkeeper?
which bookkeeper?
the bookkeeper that worked for both slans and
you're all right !
sloan and stans !
i've been there .
i've called her twice .
there's no answer .
i say we should start again .
abbott , addison , augusto ... ... aldus ... alexander ... ... eulosky , clan ... ... boyle , brenner ... ... jost , nason ... ... narrow , ness , nickels ... ... teeny , sandstrom ... ... skroes , skully ....
two weeks work , half the names crossed off and what've you got?
people aren't talking , harry .
and it's the way they're not talking that's unnatural .
harry , we've been up all night .
we went over all the quotes of the people .
want to hear some real news?
that gao report in which you placed so much faith ....
well , it has been postponed till after tonight's renomination .
what do you mean?
hughes got a call from stans in florida .
he has new information , not to republish without it .
they're going to bury the report until after the renomination .
the grand jury indictment will be out soon and every indication says ... ... it will stop at the five burglars , hunt and liddy .
and that's the end of your story .
the vote of all the delegates has been reported .
the vote for richard nixon ... ... is 1, 347 .
the vote for paul mccloskey is one .
... the nominee of the republican party for president of the united states ... ... president richard nixon !
four more years !
four more years !
the president , and the future president of the united states of america !
wonderful young faces i see out there .
your enthusiasm , your idealism , your hard work .
this is your first vote , and years from now ... ... i just hope you can all look back ... ... and say it was one of your best votes .
thank you .
hi , i'm carl bernstein of the washington post .
i just want to ask you a couple of questions .
you don't want me .
you want my sister .
it's for you .
it's carl bernstein .
oh , my god .
he's the guy from the post .
get rid of him .
could i just borrow one of your cigarettes there?
sure .
you've really got to go .
sure .
could i just get a match?
i can understand your being afraid .
there's a lot of people at the committee just like you ... ... who wanted to tell the truth but some people wouldn't listen .
certain people have gone back to the prosecutors and the fbl ... ... to give information which they were never asked .
you were hugh sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for maurice stans at finance .
we were just wondering if you were ... ... promoted to work for mr. stans immediately after mr. sloan quit ... ... or whether there was some time lapse?
i never worked for sloan or stans .
can i get you some coffee or something?
yeah .
thanks very much .
door sticks .
could i just sit down for a second?
sure , you can sit down , but i'm not going to tell you anything .
okay .
i was just curious why you lied just then?
have you been threatened if you tell the truth?
never in so many words .
how do you like it?
oh , just milk , thanks .
i saw in the wires that mrs. stans was in the hospital .
ls she feeling better?
the gao , the general accounting report said that ... ... there was $350, 000 in the safe of the committee to re elect the president .
were you aware that it was that kind of funds from the very beginning?
a lot of people are watching me .
they know i know a lot .
was it all in $100 bills?
a lot of it was .
i thought it was an all purpose , political fund ... ... you know , for taking fat cats to dinner , things like that . $350, 000 for dinners?
how was it paid out?
not in one big chunk .
there was a list of 15 names and the amount of money ... ... given to each person next to the name .
what happened to the list?
it was destroyed .
it was the only record .
don't pay attention to this .
this is just for my memory .
i have a very bad memory .
you won't be quoted by name .
ln fact , we get confirmations before we print anything .
i can't be ... ... positive that the money was used for the break in , you understand?
yes , i do .
but , people sure are worried .
which people?
think you could help me with the disbursement of money ... ... in terms of the number of people that were involved?
how many?
a group of them .
about five .
i don't know their names .
would mr. sloan know?
would he
i don't want to say anymore , okay?
i won't be much longer .
i wondered if you could just help me a little bit about ... ... the money .
we hear all kinds of figures .
there was so much of it .
how much is " so much "?
ln one two day period , six million dollars came in .
six !
six million , cash .
we didn't know where to put it all .
i thought it was all legal .
i mean , i guess i did until ... ... after the break in when i remembered gordon got so much of it .
this is mr. liddy?
it's all so rotten .
it's getting worse ... ... and the only one i care about is hugh sloan .
his wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right .
so , he quit .
i was wondering ... ... if hugh sloan was being set up now as a fall guy for john mitchell .
what do you think?
lf you guys could get john mitchell , that would be beautiful .
coffee's cold .
ls there any evidence that ... ... any of mr. mitchell's assistants ... ... were part of this?
i had all the evidence .
it was destroyed .
i don't know who destroyed it .
i think gordon did a lot of shredding .
hard evidence?
i can't say that it would positively prove that they planned the break in ... ... but it would come pretty close .
can you tell me anything about who got the money?
we've had ... ... some help on this from a couple sources .
this is sort of confirming it .
i don't want you to feel you're in a position ... ... where you have to disclose names .
i can just ask you initials ... ... and that way you're not divulging any information .
we have some idea .
would that be all right?
was there an " m "?
can you just nod either way?
did it go that high up?
l "?
i don't want to say any more , okay?
i'm sorry .
you said " l " ... ... or ... l get confused .
could we just go back for a second?
ln one six day period , over six million came in .
you wouldn't believe what was going on inside that woman !
the stuff was ready to pour out ... ... l'm pouring down cups of coffee trying to get it out of her ... ... before she throws me out of the house .
give me your notes  these are the notes .
these are the notes?
i've got stuff on napkins , matchbooks
i'm writing in the bathroom while she's getting coffee .
i'm a walking litter basket !
you're crazy .
you'd be crazy too , if you were operating on 20 cups of coffee .
could you give me something i can get down?
i got it .
i got it all .
okay .
write !
mitchell was in control !
wait a minute .
there were men working under mitchell  how many?
i don't know how many , but they received the money from the slush fund .
do we know how much money we're talking about?
we're talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars .
and these men are the key to what that money was used for .
boy , that woman was paranoid !
at one point , i suddenly wondered how high up this thing goes ... ... and her paranoia finally got to me .
i thought what we had was so hot , that any minute cbs and nbc ... ... would come and take the story away .
you're both paranoid !
she's afraid of john mitchell and you're afraid of walter cronkite .
can we go back to what she said?
here .
l " , " p " and " m.
what do you mean?
she'd only give initials .
lnitials?
the initials of the men who worked under mitchell .
l " , " p " and " m.
you couldn't get the names?
lf i could've , i would've gotten the names .
i'm with the woman , trying to get anything i can .
she said " l " , " p " and " m.
that's all she'd give me .
the people who worked under mitchell !
she said something about mitchell .
she hates him !
she said , " john mitchell ....
lf you guys could get john mitchell , that would be beautiful .
wait a minute , what's this?
what are you writing about sloan?
sloan was the treasurer of the committee to re elect .
his wife is pregnant and she made sloan quit because apparently ...
... he no longer wanted to be a part of it .
we've got to go see sloan .
okay .
make a note of it .
so , what have we got?
where's that matchbook?
here .
" l " , " p " and " m.
okay , " l " , " p " and " m.
l " could be la rue .
it could be liddy .
l " is liddy .
how do we know that?
because she said it .
right here .
she said , " at the time of the break in ...
... there was so much money floating around ...
... that i know gordon got part of it .
so i said , " you mean gordon liddy?
she said , " yes .
so , " l " is liddy .
okay , that leaves " p " and " m.
p " could be ... ... parkinson .
it could be ... ... porter .
it could be ....
wait a minute !
there was a guy once .
there was a guy we talked to last week .
didn't he say that there was a bart porter ... ... who at one time was a member of the committee?
porter was called before the grand jury investigation .
so " p " is definitely porter .
p " could be porter .
p " is porter , " l " is liddy .
all that leaves is " m " !
m " could be mccord?
that's out .
it could be ... mardian .
it could be ...
... magruder !
i think it's magruder .
i think it's magruder , too .
why do you think it's magruder?
because he was second in command under mitchell .
why do you think it's magruder?
i think it's magruder because one time he was temporary head ... ... of the committee to re elect , before mitchell .
i don't want a cookie .
we've got to get that bookkeeper to say it was magruder .
never get her to say anything about " m.
we have to go back there and try to get her to say it .
lf we could make names out of the initials ... ... we'll know the people at creep who paid off the burglars .
we'll at least know who got the money !
the indictments that came from the grand jury today ... ... stopped ... ... with the five burglars , hunt and liddy .
we've got to go back and get her to say who the names are and not initials .
she ain't going to give it to you , because i was with the woman for six hours .
we have to try .
you'll have to trick her , threaten her .
she's not going to do it .
you know what we could do?
what?
listen , we go back there ... ... and you ask her who " p " is .
then i say , " no , we know 'p 'is porter , let's just bury it .
okay .
now , wait a minute .
i say to her , " who is 'p '?
then you say to me  i say , " we know 'p 'is porter .
you try to fake her out?
right .
what if she denies it?
we're screwed .
but if she doesn't , we know " p " is porter .
try it .
they'll see you .
not if you let us in , they won't .
i'm bob woodward .
they'll see your car .
we parked around the corner .
you have answers for everything , don't you?
lf we did , we wouldn't be here .
you wrote what i told you .
no .
not your name .
no one knows it was you .
could you tell us who got the money?
and how much?
you mean like , " what did you do with the 25 grand , lady?
what?
little jokes they're making down at finance these days .
lf people are to be convinced ... ... that stans and sloan are innocent , then our reporting must be precise ... ... and you can help us .
who is " p "?
p " , we know , is porter .
you said , " 25 grand .
ls that how much porter got?
was it more?
was it more than $50, 000?
was magruder the only " m " to receive money?
who told you about porter?
i'd like to move on now to the subject of the break in at the watergate ... ... and the controversies that keep coming up out of that .
it has recently , very recently been reported now , that ... ... some documents were torn up ... ... at the committee to re elect the president .
are you investigating the tearing up of those documents
i think that came out in a story in the washington post .
i think the investigation that has just concluded itself ... ... has probably been one of the most intensive ... ... that the department of justice and the fbi has ever been involved in .
some 1, 500 persons were interviewed ... ... 1, 800 leads were followed ... ... 333 agents were involved ... ... 1 4, 000 man hours .... 5 1 of the 59 fbi field officers were involved ... ... and that , i think ... ... is a great credit to justice in this country .
did you know that documents had been destroyed?
no , i did not .
all these neat little houses and all these nice little streets .
it's hard to believe that something's wrong in some of those little houses .
no , it isn't .
we'd just like to talk to mr. sloan for a couple of minutes .
he's resting right now .
are you mrs. sloan?
aren't you the two from the post?
yes .
this is an honest house .
that's why we'd like to see your husband .
facing certain criminal charges that might be brought ... ... against some innocent people , we just feel
it's really for his benefit .
no , it's not .
it's not .
deborah , tell them to come in .
thanks .
i appreciate you giving us the time .
the reason we're here is that we've talked to certain people who ... ... have indicated the reason you left the committee ... ... was because you no longer wanted to be part of it .
yeah , right .
maybe there's an explanation why ... ... the money was handed to liddy and mitchell's aides .
try to understand this .
i'm a republican .
i am , too .
well , i believe in richard nixon .
i worked in the white house for four years and so did my wife .
what happened on june 1 7th , i don't think the president knew anything about .
ls it possible that some of his people might have known?
i'm not sure .
do you think the truth will ever come out at the trial?
that's another thing i'm not sure about .
why?
obviously , because certain people lied to the prosecutor .
no !
we were never told flat out , " don't talk !
but the message was clear , though .
ln other words , by their very silence , there was a cover up .
well , they didn't urge us to come forward and tell the truth .
they " meaning the white house?
the committee's not an independent operation .
everything's cleared with the white house .
i don't think the fbl or the prosecutors understand that .
that report on the cash ... ... in the creep safe ... ... that $350, 000?
more .
was that a correct figure?
it was closer to one million .
and as treasurer , you could release those funds?
when so ordered .
we don't know the names of the people who could order you .
we just know there were four .
there were five .
mitchell , stans , magruder , they're obvious .
there had to be a white house overseer .
yeah , colson .
no , colson's too smart to get involved directly with anything like that .
haldeman .
right?
i won't talk about the other two .
they both worked at the white house?
one did , the other one's not in washington , but that's all i'll say .
kalmbach .
nixon's personal lawyer .
yeah .
right?
nixon's personal lawyer?
i can't say anything .
i'm sorry .
when's the baby due?
soon .
next month .
are you going to stay here?
no , i don't think so .
decided where you'll go?
i've been looking for a job in the private sector , but it's ... ... it's very hard .
my name's been in the papers too much .
you know , one thing i'm just still not completely clear about?
when you handed out the money , how did that work , exactly?
badly .
i think what bob means is , ordinarily , what was the procedure?
routine .
i'd call john mitchell over at the justice department .
he'd say , " go ahead , give out the money .
this was done verbally?
yes .
we know there were five men who controlled the slush fund .
mitchell , stans and magruder .
those three we've got .
all three have been named by two sources .
what about the other two?
we're pretty sure of kalmbach .
maybe we better wait until we get all five , huh?
certain on mitchell?
we know he approved payments to liddy while he was attorney general .
you've got more than one source?
who are they?
sloan .
sloan and who else?
another guy at justice who won't confirm the other two , but we're working on it .
what about deep throat?
he's not a source on this .
but , do any of them have an ax?
personal , political , sexual .
ls there anything at all on mitchell?
no .
then can we use their names?
no .
goddamn it !
when is somebody gonna go on the record in this story?
you're about to write a story that says ... ... the former attorney general , the highest ranking ... ... law enforcement officer in this country , is a crook !
just be sure you're right !
essex house , may i help you?
john mitchell .
sir , this is carl bernstein of the washington post .
and i'm sorry to disturb you at this hour .
tomorrow we're running a story in the paper , and ... ... we think you should have a chance to comment on it .
what does it say?
john m. mitchell , while serving ... " ... as united states attorney general ...
... personally controlled a secret cash fund ...
... used to gather information about the democrats , according to ...
... the sources involved in the watergate investigation .
beginning in the spring of 1971 ...
... almost a year before he left the justice department ...
... to become president nixon's campaign manager .
on march 1 , mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund .
all that crap !
you're putting it in the paper?
it's all been denied !
you tell your publisher , tell katie graham ... ... she's going to get her tit caught in a big ringer if that's published .
christ , that's the most sickening thing i've ever heard !
i was just wondering if i could ask you some questions?
what time is it?
it's 1 1 : 30 , sir .
1 1 : 30?
is it morning or night?
it's 1 1 : 30 at night , sir .
sir , the committee to re elect has issued a statement to our story ... ... but there's a couple of questions
did the committee tell you to go ahead and publish the story?
you fellows have a great ball game going .
as soon as you're done ... ... we're going to do a story on all of you !
sir , there's a couple of questions
call my law office in the morning .
there's no question you properly identified yourself?
he said it right off the top .
did mitchell know he was talking to a reporter?
yeah , but i think i woke him up .
do you have good notes?
verbatim .
he really said that about mrs. graham?
well , cut the words " her tit " and print it .
why?
this is a family newspaper .
once when i was reporting , lyndon johnson's top guy ... ... gave me the word ... ... they were looking for a successor for j. edgar hoover .
i wrote it , and the day it appeared ... ... johnson held a press conference ... ... and appointed hoover head of the fbl for life !
call ben bradlee and tell him 'fuck you . " '
then everybody said , " you did it , ben .
you screwed up .
you stuck us with hoover forever !
i screwed up ... ... but i wasn't wrong .
how much can you tell me about deep throat?
how much do you need to know?
do you trust him?
yeah .
i can't do the reporting for my reporters ... ... which means i have to trust them .
and i hate trusting anybody .
run that baby .
the washington post reported that while still in office as attorney general ... ... john mitchell had personally controlled a secret republican fund .
mitchell denied any such involvement and called the story ludicrous .
the new charge also brought a response from vice president agnew ... ... at his stop in tampa .
i have full confidence in mr. mitchell ... ... and in the people in the republican organization ... ... and i think that ... ... that kind of unattributed report at a time like this ... ... is counterproductive .
we must bear in mind that those who published it ... ... have already shown their sympathy for the other ticket .
all non denial denials .
they doubt our ancestry , but they don't say the story isn't accurate .
did you understand one thing he said?
what i can't figure out is , what is a real denial?
lf they start calling us goddamn liars , we better start circling the wagons .
when you think they'll start doing that?
when they get out of tampa .
joe , come on .
what's going on with you guys at the fbl?
i've been trying to get to you for weeks .
your secretary says you're not in .
last night i called .
you said you couldn't talk ... ... and this morning , as soon as our mitchell story hits the stands ... ... you call me and say you've got to see me right away .
why?
you guys have been causing big trouble at the bureau .
why?
our reports are showing up in your paper almost verbatim .
you've really been on the mark , except for mitchell .
we didn't have that ... ... that he controlled the funds .
our agents have been busting ass ... ... but we'll go back now and see if we missed anything .
what i don't understand is all the people ... ... who might know details of the bugging operation ... ... the fbl hasn't even talked to .
why have you conducted interviews of creep personnel ... ... at creep headquarters ... ... instead of at their homes where they might feel freer to talk?
joe , wait a minute .
why have the interviews at creep always been conducted ... ... within the presence of the lawyer who works for creep?
look , you know i can't answer for the whole bureau .
i do what i'm told .
i followed my orders .
period .
what orders?
out of the blue !
out of the blue !
this morning i get a tip to call a guy named alex shipley ... ... who is now the assistant attorney general of tennessee .
now , the guy told me that ....
he said that ....
he said that shipley was asked in the summer of 1971 ... ... by an old army buddy , a donald segretti ... ... to join a group of other lawyers ... ... for nixon's campaign to sabotage the democratic candidates .
make a left when you can .
we'll go to my place .
sabotage democratic candidates?
i was able to make a couple of calls today and i got ... ... segretti's records for the years
his travel records for the years 1971 72 .
did you say left or right?
left !
does the fbl know about segretti?
the fbl interrogated him and found out he wasn't involved in the break in ... ... so they dropped it .
they didn't follow through on it .
where is he?
he's in california .
look at this .
segretti crisscrossed the country at least a dozen times .
he only stayed in cities where there were democratic primaries .
if the break in is just one incident in a campaign of sabotage ... ... that began one year before watergate .
then for the first time , the break in makes sense .
this isn't so crazy .
this thing didn't start with the bugging at the headquarters .
segretti was doing this a year before the bugging .
a year before , nixon wasn't slaughtering muskie .
he was running behind muskie , before muskie self destructed .
lf he self destructed .
hi .
donald segretti?
that's right .
i'm carl bernstein from the washington post .
what can i do for you?
well , my paper just sent me out here to try ... ... to persuade you to go on the record .
why me?
i guess because you were the head coordinator of nixon's ... ... sabotage campaign against the democrats .
carl , you want some coffee?
you read my mind .
carl , tell me something .
what do you imagine the head coordinator does?
i guess you're involved in recruiting other people like yourself ... ... other lawyers .
lawyers?
like alex shipley .
i made it clear that i would not do anything violent or illegal .
what do you mean by illegal?
watergate .
the whole bugging .
that's horrendous !
what kind of stuff do you guys do then?
nickel and dime stuff .
stuff .
stuff with a little wit attached to it .
you mean , when you sent out on muskie's stationery that ... ... senator hubert humphrey was going out with call girls?
listen , if anything , it helped the man's image !
what was the one on muskie's stationery you sent out ... ... that said scoop jackson was having a bastard child?
so , sometimes it got up to a quarter .
off the record .
i think one of the most interesting ones was the canuck letter .
what about it?
come on .
where you claimed that muskie slurred the canadians .
i didn't write that .
do you know who did?
when you guys print it in the papers , then i'll know .
smart guy , donald .
you're no dummy .
i'm a lawyer , carl .
i'm a lawyer .
i'm a good lawyer ... ... and i'll probably wind up going to jail and being disbarred ... ... and i don't know what i did that was so goddamned awful .
i'll tell you something .
none of this was my idea .
i didn't go looking for the job .
that's important .
chapin came to you .
it's funny , but i keep forgetting that you guys knew each other in college .
you were friends at sc , you and chapin .
who else was there?
there was me ... ... dwight ... ... ziegler ... ... all the usc mafia .
that's when you got involved in the student elections ... ... when you started to try to get your man in ... ... so you stuffed ballot boxes , and ....
what was that term you guys used for screwing up the opposition?
rat fucking .
you were doing the same stuff when you were ... ... out campaigning for president nixon .
let me tell you something , we did a lot of worse things in college .
let me ask you something , carl .
what would you've done if you were just getting out of the army ... ... been away from the real world for four years ... ... didn't know what kind of law you wanted to practice ... ... and one day you get a call from an old friend ... ... asking if you want to go to work for the president of the united states?
chapin was the appointment secretary for nixon when he called .
lf those sinister things really happened ... ... l don't think dwight knew anything about them .
he just did what he was told .
told by who?
what's the topic for tonight?
rat fucking .
ln my day it was simply known as the double cross .
ln our present context ... ... it means infiltration of the democrats .
segretti won't go on the record ... ... but if he would , we know he would implicate chapin .
and that would put you inside the white house .
who?
be specific .
how high up?
you'll have to find that out for yourself .
i don't like newspapers .
i don't care for inexactitude ... ... and shallowness .
the creep slush fund ... ... that financed the rat fucking , we've just about got that nailed down .
did you change cabs?
yeah .
does the fbl know what we know?
does justice?
why haven't they done anything?
lf it didn't deal directly with the break in , they didn't pursue .
who told them not to?
don't you understand what you're onto?
mitchell knew?
of course , mitchell knew !
do you think something this size just happens?
haldeman had to know too .
you'll get nothing from me about haldeman .
segretti said
don't concentrate on segretti .
you'll miss the overall .
the letter ... ... that destroyed the muskie candidacy , the canuck letter ... ... did it come from inside the white house?
you're missing the overall .
what overall?
they were frightened of muskie , and look who got destroyed .
they wanted to run against mcgovern .
look who they're running against .
they bugged .
they followed people .
false press leaks .
fake letters .
they canceled democratic campaign rallies .
they investigated democratic private lives .
they planted spies , stole documents , and on and on .
now , don't tell me you think this is all the work of little don segretti .
the fbl and justice know this?
why don't you pick up your messages more often?
who's pete teller?
i haven't the slightest idea .
i have this whole place to take care of .
do you guys know about the canuck letter?
yep .
i'm sorry , i'm late .
i just wanted to make sure you knew who wrote it .
what?
what?
you mean the letter that sabotaged the muskie candidacy?
all right , come here .
when did he tell you this?
tell him what you told me .
here , sit down .
just exactly the way you said it to me , just say it to him .
ken clawson told me he wrote the canuck letter .
the letter that said muskie was slurring the canadians .
the deputy director of white house communications wrote the canuck letter .
when did he tell you this?
when we were having drinks .
where were you?
my apartment .
when did you say he told you?
two weeks ago .
what else did he say?
he didn't say anything?
you're hedging .
did he say it to impress you to get you to go to bed with him?
jesus !
no , i want to hear her say it .
do you think he said it to impress you to try to get you to go to bed with him?
why did it take you two weeks to tell us this , sally?
i guess i don't have the taste for the jugular you guys have .
you're claiming it was a misunderstanding?
absolutely .
sally's got it all wrong .
i never told her ... ... i wrote that letter .
we were just shooting the breeze about the election .
she's an awfully good reporter .
i don't remember her getting that much wrong before , do you?
that's a real bullshit question , woodward .
that is a question straight out of wichita , kansas .
listen .
one last thing .
do you remember where this " shooting the breeze " took place?
what do you mean , where?
i mean , was it a restaurant , or her apartment , or a bar ...?
i'd forgotten the entire incident , but it most certainly wasn't in her apartment .
do you remember when it took place?
i don't have time for this .
i'm a busy man .
what did he say about meeting in a bar or restaurant?
he said he forgot the entire incident .
that means he didn't deny it .
that's a non denial denial .
wichita , kansas?
he said that's a bullshit question .
i know what he said .
but , i'm from wheaton , illinois .
he's on the phone .
who?
clawson !
get over there on line four and transcribe this , will you?
sally , for christ's sake , don't tell them i came to your place !
why not?
what's wrong with coming over for a drink?
you and me?
in your apartment?
well?
jesus christ , you just shot me down !
if it appears in the papers that i'm over at your house , having ....
do you know what that does?
no , i don't see why .
you don't?
you don't?
there's nothing bad about it .
well , there sure is !
this is just incredible !
i have a clear conscience .
sally , i have a wife and a family , and a dog and a cat !
she said he was in her house having a drink .
i don't care where it happened .
what happened is what counts .
when we asked him about it , he said he forgot the entire incident .
ken clawson on the line .
ken !
what's up kid?
this whole thing that's going on over there ... ... i want you to know that i never claimed authorship of the canuck letter !
says he never wrote the letter .
it's some kind of misunderstanding
slow down , ken .
you sound frazzled .
please listen .
if you're going to refer to that alleged conversation ... ... with sally akin , you can't print that it took place in her apartment !
i have a wife and a family , and a dog and a cat !
a wife and a family , and a dog and a cat .
right , ken .
right .
i don't want to print that you were in sally's apartment .
thank god !
i just want to know what you said in sally's apartment .
i just got a tip from our fbi source .
the secret cash fund financed segretti .
all right .
now listen .
chapin hired segretti , we know that ... ... and we know haldeman hired chapin .
haldeman has to be the fifth name to control the fund .
sloan knows .
we've only got four out of the five who controlled the fund .
it has to be haldeman .
i don't think we've got it .
we know the fifth is a top white house official .
no one has said it .
no one has named haldeman .
no one's denied it .
that still doesn't prove it was haldeman .
lf you go to bed at night and there's no snow ... ... and when you wake up there's snow ... ... you can say it snowed , although you didn't see it snowing .
lf we can't prove the fifth man is haldeman , we're wiped out .
everything in that campaign is done with his approval .
we know that everybody who works under haldeman ... ... does so with his knowledge .
and everybody is under haldeman , except the president .
common sense says it's haldeman .
lf we go and see sloan ... ... and tell him we know he named haldeman to the grand jury ....
then all we would need to do is have him confirm it .
want to do it that way?
yes .
let's go back and see sloan .
we can't go now .
he's not home yet .
he might not be answering , but he might be there .
please ....
we've already written the story .
we just need you to define
debbie's in the hospital .
my in laws are coming over ....
two questions?
we understand .
the cash that financed the watergate break in .
five men had control of the fund .
mitchell , stans , magruder , kalmbach .
we have confirmations on those four .
we found out haldeman's the fifth .
i'm not your source on that .
we're not asking you to be our source .
we ask you to confirm it .
i'm not your source on haldeman !
when you were questioned by the grand jury ....
you had to name names .
of course , if they asked , yes .
say we wrote a story that said haldeman was the fifth name to control the fund .
would we be in any trouble?
would we be wrong?
let me put it this way .
i would have no problems if you wrote a story like that .
you wouldn't?
no .
that's okay .
oh , you had a baby !
my wife did .
little boy or girl?
it's a girl .
congratulations .
we're sorry to bother you .
will you give our best to her?
i will .
woodward and i are curious of the fact ... ... that the fbl , in its entire inquiry , never talked to the ... ... or did any inquiries into the second most powerful man to the president .
you don't seem to understand .
you get nothing about haldeman out of me .
but we don't need to know anything .
tomorrow we're going with a story on the fbl .
and we're going to establish in that story ... ... that you guys blew the whole investigation .
no , we didn't miss so much !
you didn't know haldeman had control of the slush fund .
we did .
it's all in our files !
not about him .
yeah , haldeman .
john haldeman !
now , look , i'm very busy .
i've got to go put the kids to bed .
that's the confirmation right there !
wait a minute .
did he say john?
he said haldeman .
he said john haldeman !
what difference does it make if he said lsaiah or david?
there's only one haldeman .
well , lsaiah or david aren't assistants to the president .
i don't know , it still feels thin .
i wish we knew if we could print this !
we didn't make them do these things , but once they did , they're fair game !
let's go over your sources again .
i want to hear it .
sloan told the grand jury .
he answered everything they asked him .
that means there's got to be a record somewhere .
he told the grand jury , the fbl confirms .
what more do you need?
i happen to love this country .
we're not a bunch of zanies out to bring it down !
weren't you arguing the opposite way?
no , no !
hold it !
we're about to accuse haldeman ... ... who happens to be the second most important man in this country ... ... of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the white house .
it would be nice if we were right .
have you double checked your sources?
bernstein , are you sure on this story?
absolutely !
woodward?
i'm sure .
i'm not .
it still seems thin .
get another source .
how many fucking sources do they think we've got?
you sure deep throat won't confirm?
he won't confirm !
i told you .
what about the guy in justice?
i can't call him .
he's right next to the grand jury .
we have no choice .
twenty minutes to deadline .
i don't know if i can get him on the phone .
deputy general's office , please .
do you know when you expect him back?
i believe he left for the evening .
if you'd like to leave a message ....
could you hold , please?
hi , this is carl .
sorry to disturb you now .
we're going with the story that haldeman is the fifth man to control the fund ... ... and they're hassling us .
we've got three confirmations .
lf you could just help us , i'd appreciate it .
i won't say anything about haldeman .
not ever .
i understand .
we don't want you to do that .
we know it's against the law for you to say anything .
lf there's a way you could warn us to hold on the story , we'd appreciate it .
i'd really like to help you , but i can't .
i'm going to count to 10 , all right?
lf there's any reason we should hold on the story , hang up before i get to 10 .
lf the story's all right , you just be on the phone after i get to 10 , all right?
hang up , right?
that's right .
you got it?
i'm going to start counting .
okay , i'm counting .
1 ... 2 ... ... 3 ... 4 ... 5 ... ... 6 ... 7 ... ... 8 ... 9 ... 10 ....
you got it straight now?
everything's okay?
everything's fine .
woodward !
we got it !
he confirmed !
what happened?
i said if i get up to 10 and you don't hang up , it's solid .
did he confirm it?
absolutely .
we've got to tell bradlee !
bernstein got another source !
the guy at justice confirmed !
lf there's any doubt , we can run it tomorrow .
the story's solid .
we're sure of it .
i just got off the phone with him .
it's gold !
okay , we go with it .
woodstein !
you know what it's about?
no .
sloan , who later resigned as campaign treasurer ... ... after the watergate break in ... ... showed up for a deposition in the common cause suit on ... ... disclosure of campaign contributions , and denied naming haldeman .
would you comment on your testimony before the grand jury?
my attorney will answer that question .
the answer is an unequivocal " no .
mr. sloan did not implicate mr. haldeman in that testimony at all .
did he mention any use of funds for espionage activity?
none , whatsoever .
thank you , gentlemen .
thank you .
sloan expanded his denial to include his statements to the fbl ... ... and to all federal authorities .
shortly after , at the white house ... ... news secretary ronald ziegler delivered a strong attack ... ... on the washington post .
why is the post trying to do it?
you have a man ... ... the editor of the washington post by the name of ben bradlee .
i think anyone who would want to honestly assess ... ... what his political persuasions are , would ... ... i think come to the conclusion , quite quickly ... ... that he is not a supporter of president nixon .
i respect the free press .
i don't respect that type of journalism ... ... the shabby journalism that is being practiced by the washington post .
all i know is that the story that ran this morning ... ... is incorrect and it's been so ... ... stated as being incorrect ... ... by not only me , but by the individual ... ... whose grand jury , secret grand jury testimony ... ... they based their story on .
that individual has denied that he ever so testified .
no sooner had ziegler finished , than the president's campaign manager ... ... clark macgregor , met with reporters .
using innuendo ... ... third person hearsay ... ... unsubstantiated charges , anonymous sources ... ... and huge , scare headlines ... ... the post has maliciously sought to give the appearance ... ... of a direct connection between the white house and the watergate .
a charge which the post knows ... ... and half a dozen investigations have found to be false .
the hallmark of the post campaign is hypocrisy ... ... and its celebrated double standard is today visible for all to see .
i'm not talking to you about haldeman or anybody else !
then what went wrong?
nothin '.
just tell us what went wrong?
didn't you say the fbl had the information on haldeman in the files?
because we have it in the notes ... ... from the conversation we had on the phone .
we have to go talk to your boss if you don't talk to us .
what the hell are you talking about?
i'll deny everything !
we're not trying to get anybody into trouble .
we're just trying to find out if we made some errors .
lf we made a mistake , then we'll come off the story .
tell us if we're wrong .
tell us if we screwed up .
i'm not talking about it !
i am not talking to you about haldeman or anybody else .
i can't even be seen talking to either one of you bastards .
what are you afraid of?
who got to you?
are we being set up?
are we , joe?
tell us !
are we being set up?
just tell us , we won't panic .
fuck you !
and fuck you !
jesus , what was our mistake?
maybe there was no mistake .
then they're just setting us up .
then the whole thing was a set up?
and they just hung us !
more denunciations .
you'll have to make a statement .
one senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes !
i knew we had enemies , but i didn't know we were this popular .
look at this !
my non denial denial .
fuck it , let's stand by the boys .
okay .
foreign?
all right , here's our headline .
radio hanoi reports the united states north vietnam agreement ... ... for a settlement of the vietnam war .
woodward , what did you find out?
what'd he say?
what time is it?
you fell asleep?
over here .
you let haldeman slip away .
yes .
you've done worse than let haldeman slip away .
you've got people feeling sorry for him .
didn't think that was possible .
ln a conspiracy like this ... ... you build from the outer edges and you go step by step .
lf you shoot too high and miss , everybody feels more secure .
you put the investigation back months .
yes , we know that .
lf we're wrong , we're resigning .
were we wrong?
you'll have to find that out , won't you?
i'm tired of your chicken shit games !
i don't want hints .
i need to know what you know .
it was a haldeman operation .
the whole business was run by haldeman , the money , everything .
it won't be easy getting at him .
he was insulated .
you'll have to find out how .
mitchell started doing covert stuff before anyone else .
the list is longer than anyone can imagine .
it involves the entire u. s. intelligence community .
fbl ... ... cla , justice .
it's incredible .
the cover up had little to do with watergate .
it was mainly to protect the covert operations .
it leads everywhere .
get out your notebook .
there's more .
your lives are in danger .
i finally got sloan on the phone .
why didn't you tell me over the phone?
woodward says phones aren't safe .
can't trust 'em .
come in .
we can't come in .
woodward says there's electronic surveillance .
surveillance?
who's doing it?
it's being done .
people's lives are in danger .
maybe even ours .
what happened to that justice source of yours?
i guess i made instructions too complicated .
he thought i said " hang up " when i just said " hang on .
jesus !
the story is right .
haldeman is the fifth man to control that fund .
sloan would've told the grand jury .
sloan wanted to tell the grand jury .
why didn't he?
because nobody asked .
the cover up had little to do with the break in .
it was to protect covert operations and the covert activities ... ... involved in the entire u. s. intelligence community .
did deep throat say that people's lives are in danger?
yes !
what else did he say?
he said everyone is involved .
you know the results of the latest gallup poll?
half the country never even heard of the word " watergate .
nobody gives a shit .
you guys are probably pretty tired .
you should be .
go home .
get a nice hot bath , rest up 15 minutes ... ... then get your asses back in gear .
we're under a lot of pressure , you know , and you put us there .
nothing's riding on this except the first amendment of the constitution ... ... freedom of the press , and maybe the future of the country .
not that any of that matters ... ... but if you guys fuck up again , i'm going to get mad !
and now , fellow americans ... ... the honorable chief justice ... ... will administer the oath of office ... ... to the president of the united states of america .
mr. chief justice .
mr. president , are you ready to take the constitutional oath?
if you will place your left hand on the bible and raise your right hand ... ... and please repeat after me .
i , richard nixon , do solemnly swear ... " ... i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states ...
... and will , to the best of my ability ... " ... preserve , protect and defend the constitution of the united states ...
... so help me god .
