i won't even call it a plant .
it's wheat .
i won't even call it a wheat .

i am dr. aki ross .

not unlimited clearance .
and not without authorization .
captain , i don't have time for this .
do you realize you have just risk the lives at my squad and me?
look .
i don't want to talk about it .
the fact of the matter is , it was worth the lives of you and your men .
you and your men?
she thinks you are a man .
i think she's an idiot .
i know you are not a man .
i think you're an idiot too .
very funny .
but i do want to talk about it .
did it occur to you that maybe we are not volunteer to risk our lives?
have we been given a choice?
nobody asked you to save me .
i can't believe this .
you have not changed a bit .
gray?
yeah , nice to see you too .
welcome back , captain .
we're cleaned .
let's make sure of this , shall we?
i hate getting scanned .
sir , the scan probably worth to us than the phantoms .
i'll probably abort it , captain .
this machine are suspected to causing sterility .
and i want to have a little new junior to call me daddy someday .
that's a spooky thought .
why are you always busting my chop?
people , let's just do this thing .
alright .
yes , sir .
yes , sir .
okay , next .
looks like you gain some weight .
it's called body strength , neil .
get a girlfriend .
i'm working on it .
you know my security rating allows me to bypass this .
not today , it doesn't .
something's not right .
about this mission?
or that woman?
both .
next .
listen , captain .
i think ...
i don't care what you think , doctor .
you're getting scanned just like everybody else .
oh shit !
captain !
they got him .
there must be a mistake .
you came in contact with the phantom , sir .
please remain calm .
administering treatment shield .
what level is he?
blue .
he will be coded at 3 1/ 2 minutes .
we have to treat him now .
i'm sorry .
that's impossible .
we'll transfer him to the treatment center .
there's no time for that .
take him to the table .
hang on , captain .
locating particles .
jesus !
look at that thing .
how much more time?
not enough .
when he reaches code red , the treatment shield won't be able to hold the aliens particles
engaging bio ethereal laser .
what's going on?
where does it go?
what the hell is going on?
we lost contact .
infer station is moving deeper .
dragging .
there is no time .
dragging .
there is no time !
you're gonna lose him .
founded .
it's alright .
don't worry .
you'll be back to normal in no time .
doctor , we need to scan you for in infer station .
that won't be necessary .
i'll take responsibility .
hey , doc .
thanks for saving him .
are you alright?
yeah , but the military has impounded my ship
what's with her?
and what's with her with the captain?
what's with her and the stupid plan?
what?
forward me the phantom data and everything we got in the file spirits collected so far .
yes , doctor .
spirits?
i thought we are not suppose to use the s word .
don't get smart with me .
let's see if the plant does the trick .
it's a match .
we've found it .
yes , the 6th spirit .
a little scene today brought me every protocol
how long do you think this would have survive outside the barrier?
aki , you know there are elements in the council military just waiting for an excuse to shut us down .
look .
1 0 years ago , who discovered the energy and the phantoms?
you .
and who proved the same energy source existed in humans and every life form?
you .
you made the possible to harness that energy for overpacks , scanners , even the barrier .
the council knows that .
they trust you , doctor .
we are so close to proving ...
we still need this part and this one here .
exactly .
two more pieces and we solve the puzzle .
we need to be free to find these pieces .
i want to show you something , aki .
what is this?
read .
all life is born of gaya and each life has a spirit .
each new spirit is housed in physical body .
doctor ...
go on .
through their experiences on earth , the spirits mature and grows .
when the physical body dies , the mature spirit enrich by it's life on earth returns to gaya .
bring in with it the experiences , enabling gaya to live and grow .
to my old diary .
i wrote that 43 years ago when i was the age you are now .
dr. sid !
i don't know what happen to gary will .
they threw him into jail because he said that earth was not descendant of the universe .
that could happen to us .
our ideas are unpopular , aki .
if you have any notes or records , it could be used against you .
destroy them .
keep them up here .
right .
and stay away from your friend , that captain .
he saves your life , you save his life .
that's least to that .
i was once young too , you know .
doctor , there is a war going on .
no one is young anymore .
could you please explain why zeus cannon was completed a month ago .
if we attack their media with this , we will eliminate the phantoms at their source .
general hein , calm down .
at our last meeting , we voted 6 to 2 to postpone using the zeus cannon .
to attack alienated media .
we have reconvince today to vote on that very issue again .
now i would like to ask the director of the bio ethereal center to speak .
dr sid , please .
as you all know , the phantom nested the alienated media that landed here 34 years ago .
what you see now , are the records of assault on the media to date .
physical attacks here had no affect .
this seems to place 3 months ago joining a full scale of art .
please note that the phantom outside the media are indeed destroyed .
however inside , many that come to live .
and as you see over all phantom density remains the same .
the newly recent aliens response to the attack .
by burly , even deeper into the earth .
now this is very interesting to me , dr. sid .
because we see the same thing during surgery .
when using bio ethereal laser on phantom particles .
do we not?
yes , indeed we do .
you see the injured escape , burying or digging themselves deeper into the patient body .
when we increase the laser power to destroy these deep particles .
we have had incidents resulting and further injury to a patient .
and in some cases , death .
and what exactly does that mean , doctor?
it means there is a very good chance to being from the zeus cannon built in the phantoms in a media .
exactly .
thank you .
however , it also means that the being energy maybe too strong injuring the earth .
injure the earth?
you mean the spirit of the earth?
yes .
the spirit of the earth .
i need to say what i need to say .
i know what i'm doing .
and whatever you do , keep you mouth shut .
this is ridiculous .
doctor , with all the respect .
you come here just to talk about some gaya theory?
tell us the planet is alive?
has a spirit?
that's a fairy tale , doctor .
sorry , but we don't have time for that .
it's not a fairy tale , it's true .
so if i point a gun to the earth and fire ,
i'm not just making a hole on the ground , i am killing the planet .
dr. sid , the gaya theory has not been proven .
even the gaya does exist .
we still have to remove the phantoms .
i think if there is any chance of success .
we should take it?
don't you agree?
of course i do .
but there is an alternative to this space cannon
another method?
yes , i mean of disabling the phantoms .
please .
we know that the aliens display distinct energy pattern
now it is a fact that two bio ethereal waves places one over the other will cancel each other out .
it's the erectile possible to construct the wave pattern direct opposition to the phantom energy .
we are currently assembling ...
dr. sid ....
such a wave in new completion ...
members of the council , gathering plants and animals from around the world to fight the phantoms is other nonsense .
the zeus cannon is a proven effective weapon .
it will kill phantoms .
can we afford to wait for some crazy inventions
some army of touchy feeling plants and animals
an invention with no solid evidence that will destroy the aliens .
there is evidence .
our partially completed energy wave has a terminally successfully stopped phantom particles from spreading through a terminally infected patient .
doctor , do you claim to have evidence that terminally patient has been cured .
not cured .
the wave is not completed .
but we have succeeded in containing the particles safely inside the patient .
where is the proof?
here .
you may have bothered sometime , aki .
but i wonder what caused?
doctor , i can't keep hiding in the background while you protect me .
i want what life i have left to mean something .
you listen to me .
when we find the 7th and 8th spirits ......
if we find them , what we need now is some luck .
luck has nothing to do with it .
fate and hard work , girl .
cause i'll be damn if you die before me .
the council decided to postpone firing the zeus cannon .
i guess i put on a good show .
mind if i take a look?
you'll probably get bored .
so what are you doing?
oh , i see .
giving me the silent treatment .
i am scanning the city for the 7th spirit .
hurry up , neil .
i almost got it .
what do you think you are doing?
we just gonna strengthen them for a while .
hey , don't look at me .
it was his idea .
it's your idea?
we just help the captain up a little .
come on , jane .
where's your sense of romance?
you see how the captain looks at her .
it's a more , baby .
what's going on?
probably just a glint .
listen , aki ...
i'm still mad at you .
you are mad at me?
leaving your helmet on and not telling me who you were?
that doesn't seem a little childish .
i was just a little upset when you dispatched and leave the zeus station without saying a word .
now you know what's going on , alright?
now i know .
my operation had to be done in zero graph , okay?
fine ! how about the fact that i was sent there on the job
and you won't even see me?
i was probably helping dr. sid collected the spirit wave .
now i know .
so i'm sorry .
well , me too .
so we are both sorry .
so would you tell me about them?
about what?
about the spirits you collected .
i was infected by the phantom during an experiment .
normally no one could had survived .
how could you?
dr. sid created a memory around the infection
keeping me alive .
so the first spirit wave was me .
the second was a fish .
a fish?
the third was a deer i found in a wildlife preserved outside moscow .
the fourth was a bird .
ever try to track a sparrow out of space?
it's no fun .
what am i saying?
you probably would love that .
you are right .
i probably would .
and then there was that plant i collected from time square .
i thought that was number 6 .
what?
you skipped one .
the fifth was a little girl dying in a hospital emergency room .
i retrieved the disabling time , but she ...
i told her everything has a spirit .
dogs , cats , trees , little girls , even the earth .
i told her that she wasn't dying , just returning to the earth spirit .
the gaya .
she ... told me that she was ready to die .
she said i didn't have to make up stories to make her feel better .
only 7 years old and ready to die .
i'm sorry .
i have work to do .
i have to find the 7th and the 8th spirits .
don't ... please ....
you don't believe any of this , do you?
i just ... don't know , aki .
is this why you shut me out?
you should have told me .
i don't know how much time i left .
who does?
i better get back to scanning .
captain edwards , you extracted a dr. ross from old new york several days ago .
did you not?
what were you impressions of dr ross?
she seems very capable and determines .
you and the deep eyes are being temporary reassigned .
you will guard dr. ross when she re enters the waste land .
understood , sir .
you don't understand yet , captain .
report any ebullient behavior in dr ross to the major immediately .
ebullient behavior , sir?
the woman carries an alien infer station , captain .
we don't know what it maybe doing to her .
the aliens presence could be effecting her judgement .
and maybe manipulate the doctor for their very own purposes
is the general suggesting that dr ross is a spy?
the general is wondering why he explains himself to a captain .
she separated long exposure to phantom tissue
if this begins to manifest itself in anyway ,
dr ross is to be placed under arrest .
and transport here for observation .
it is in fact for her own good , captain .
of course , sir .
major , send some of our man to keep an eye on our good captain .
i'm convinced these dreams are some form of communication .
the message still elude to me .
but they are coming faster now .
and that can only mean one thing .
the phantoms inside me are beginning to win
our target is to discrete at two sign .
roger .
phantom concentration .
not good .
we got big minutes everywhere .
so it's gonna be a real picnic .
stick close to me .
no heroin today , okay?
everything by the book .
by the book , alright .
if we drop energy here , here and here .
we should be able quiet at the target and get out even before the phantoms know we were there .
and that would attract the phantoms .
for a while .
so you are from the 307s , right?
under general hein?
have you done any wasteland recon before?
and get pretty ugly .
captain , rendezvous at sector 6 coded 279 .
roger that .
stellar for hard files .
looks like they are taking a bath .
the 7th spirit should be just beyond the line .
i don't see how any living thing could survive out here .
you'll find out soon enough .
this was the phantom cleansing mission .
it was supposed the end of war .
my father is in here somewhere .
alright .
let's move out , people .
i'll be damn .
a survivor .
what is it doing out here?
hoping for life to return .
is that our spirit , doc?
no .
we've closing in on a life form .
distance?
hard to say .
we are very close .
i don't see anything .
you're not gonna tell me it's him .
that's impossible
it's not the soldier .
it's his overpack .
how do you explain that?
packs?
power or weapon?
the barrier cities?
i mean it's just by with theory energy .
and to create that energy , we use living tissue .
single cell organism .
you're telling me his backpack is the 7th spirit .
yes .
captain , do you read me?
once again .
captain , we have incoming .
ryan , get the soldier's pack .
i need a hand , sergeant .
those boys .
yeah .
then i'll working .
thank you .
are you alright?
of course i am .
let's get the hell out of here .
something is not right .
it should be happening .
something are tracking them .
aki ...
there are right on us , sir .
closing fast .
jane , take the lead .
fire the hole !
get us out of here , neil .
sir , i would love to .
but ...
just do it !
sir?
locate that seat .
that doesn't look good , captain .
we have to get her to a hospital .
you have your order , sir .
what the hell is happening here?
dr ross is to be taken into the custody now .
lower your weapon .
that's an order .
we have no choice but to relief you and your command .
i won't let you do this , soldier .
you'll gonna have to shoot me .
bend down , captain !
aki !
hang on , everyone !
that's enough !
everyone down .
neil , get us back to new york .
fast .
the device are returned from the wasteland , sir .
apparently there was an incident .
it would seem the phantoms were attracted to dr ross .
the crew barely escaped with their lives .
and sir ...
captain edward is still in command .
issue an order .
i want edward and dr ross to be place under arrest .
all research materials pretending to dr sid wave theory are to be confiscated immediately .
that might not go over too well with the council , sir .
what a tragedy that would be .
this is perfect , major .
it's too good the captain has opened the door for us .
by tomorrow morning , the council would bear our feet .
thanking us for exposing the traitors and imploring us .
to save them from the phantoms .
how is she , doctor?
she is dying .
there must be something you can do .
aki is fighting with only the 6th and 8th spirits .
we have to implant the 7th directly into her chest plate .
it took a bullet .
i think it might be damage .
we have to appear this panel quickly .
her vital signs are dropping .
aki is slipping away from us .
she needs a sympathetic spirit to help her held hold in this world .
and i can think of no spirit but to suit for that task but yours , captain .
i don't understand .
you don't have to understand .
you just be with her now .
you'll keep her here with us .
aki , where are we?
on an alien planet .
how is that possible?
i'm not entirely sure .
you seem pretty calm .
i have been having this dream every night for months .
dream?
well , whatever it is .
you're really here , aren't you?
what's happening to me?
dr sid is implanting the 7th spirit directly into your body .
then you are my spiritual support .
gray , how sweet of you .
i don't think you realize how serious this situation is .
something you should see here , sir .
and i am watching ... what , major?
it seems dr ross has been recording her dreams .
and why would i be interested in it ... her dreams?
this is it .
this is our evidence .
she's under influence of the phantoms .
dr ross's dreams should be all the council needs authorize the firing of the zeus cannon .
the council is contempt to hide powering inside this barrier while the world dies a little more everyday .
i believe they need a push in the right direction , major .
get another a group of your most trusted men .
what are they doing?
why are they staring at us?
not at us .
welcome back , captain .
is it over?
how is she , doctor?
she is going to be fine .
but this is only temporary .
we need to find the 8th and final spirit to cure her .
aki , can you hear me?
i'd finished it .
i know what the phantoms really are .
nobody move !
you are all under arrest !
we have them , sir .
sir?
my wife and daughter .
were killed by phantoms in san francisco when the city was attacked .
did i ever tell you that?
i try to imagine what ...
how is that like seeing everyone around you , fall over dead with no apparent reason .
and then at the end , you're feeling something next to you .
invisible ... touching you .
reaching inside your body .
you've lost family , haven't you?
yes , sir .
that's why i trust you .
all for you .
you know what must be done .
major , arrest these man .
reduce power to sector 31 .
sir , you do realize that the phantoms ...
what i realize , major is that we must force the council to take action against the enemy .
25 % % of energy redirect .
over ring power put to sector 31 .
bury the bridge in sector 31 , general .
they're coming through now .
i think we can easily handle a few phantoms in a contain space .
relax , major .
when this night is over , you are going to be a hero .
aki , i don't think ...
you were in my dream , gray .
you saw it .
that's just it .
i'm not sure what i saw .
how can you be?
captain , please .
let her continue .
why do you think , we've never been able to determine a relationship between the human size phantoms .
and the giant one's roaming away slants .
excuse me , doc .
but frequent relationship .
i mean you got your human size phantoms and your creepy caterpillary phantoms .
and your flying phantoms .
and let's not forget my personal favorite .
the big fat giant phantoms ...
down , boy .
he's right .
if you spend as much time in this field as we have .
you know there is no relationship .
is like a zoo out there .
precisely , i think the giant ones are like our whales along for the ride?
it must be the ship of some kind crazy known as ark .
we always assume that the media was intended as a form of transportation .
perhaps it wasn't .
the media is a chunk of their planet .
they got thrown into space when they destroyed their world .
but how could they survive the trip across outer space on a hunk of rock?
they didn't .
this is all beginning to make a creepy kind of sense .
what do you think about all this , captain?
i think that explains why we never had a chance .
all our strategies are based on one assumption .
that me are fighting alien invaders .
think of the dream , gray .
how they die?
since then , all they know is suffering .
they are not an invading army .
they are ghosts .
how many phantoms?
more than enough to convince the council , sir .
excellent .
send the squad out to eliminate them .
yes , sir .
sir , i have numerous phantoms contacts .
well , of course you do .
outside sector 31 , sir .
and moving in incredible speed .
major , what the hell is going on here?
they are in the pipes .
that's impossible .
no living thing could survive in those pipes .
well , we got a big one heading this way .
oh my god ...
hold your fire !
what have i done?
come on , neil .
we need to find a way out .
now think .
captain , these wall titanium alloy .
and the bars are all pole sonic lasers .
i mean is not like i can just wave a magic wont and ...
neil , i'm impressed .
that makes two of us .
proceed to the nearest evacuation facility .
i think we should proceed to the nearest evacuation facility .
proceed to the nearest evacuation facility .
here they come .
but the others ...
dr. sid !
deep eyes will take care of him .
come on !
what's happening?
why can we see them now?
it must be carry resistible charge passing through the barrier .
behind you !
on the board , captain .
we must find my ship .
if it was towed inside the city , it could be in the military hangar .
that's a big 'if '.
look out !
get us out of the platform .
you got it .
okay , now what?
we're going through the station .
what?
captain , with all respect ...
excuse me , captain ...
we're going through it .
it's the only way .
should i gather all this will be somehow a rough ride .
doc , you got a talent for understatement .
hang on , everybody .
doc?
interesting .
anybody hurt?
captain !
oh god !
talk to me , sergeant .
give me a hand , jane .
no , wait !
we're risking for the injury .
we need the proper tools to cut him out .
they are in my ship .
no !
no , doc .
no drugs .
captain ...
you heard the man .
we'll find the ship and we'll be back for you .
i'll stay with him .
me too .
nobody's staying .
just give me a gun .
you got it .
give him a weapon .
do it !
we'll be back for you , sergeant .
you hear me?
i hear you , captain .
now get out of here .
let's move out .
aqua isolated t. v.
this is good .
it can be used to retrieve ryan and transport him safely here .
however we need to replace this plane's fuel
there could be some lives overpack in the hangar .
alright , jane .
check the hangar .
neil , get us ready for take off .
aki and dr. sid prep the quad troll .
i'll go to the tower and rotate the air track .
the city maybe lose .
but we are not .
let's do this thing and get the hell out of here .
gray ...
be careful .
you too .
oh yeah .
neil , do you read me?
loud and clear , captain .
this baby would fly itself .
flight plane is set .
beginning rotation .
this is not the air track .
we have a problem .
i'm reading an impound tracks detach to the ship .
can you disengage it from the cockpit?
no , sir .
permission to go outside and detach the cockpit .
do it !
there is the problem .
the controls are locked naturally .
jane , let me ask you something .
you think we're going to get out here alive?
i mean i'm wondering if anybody is getting out
you think anyone had made it this far?
you think this 8th spirit stuff is going to work and chase out all the phantoms?
i mean what if it is all a bunch of mambo jumbo?
jane , do you mind if we stop talking?
i gotta concentrate here .
what's happening down there .
nothing we can't handle .
what's your status?
almost there .
we're fine , sir .
jane is negotiating with the extreme residents .
talk to me , jane .
no problem here , captain .
yes !
captain , we are good to go .
no !
jane , get out of there .
get out now !
go !
get the hell out of there !
jane !
unseal the power and ready .
where are you going?
to the cockpit .
the ship is set on autopilot
we are in countdown to leave off .
wait .
it's too dangerous .
aki !
over here .
you son of the bitch .
ryan !
gray , do you read me?
what's happening?
you and sid are getting out of here now .
no !
we can't just leave everyone .
everyone's dead .
i'm sorry .
but you don't have a choice .
goodbye , aki .
i just ...
i wish i could believe they are in a better place .
i enlarge the scanning parameter to include an area .
the impact crater .
that's the strange place to find the ex spirit .
yes , really .
but nothing can survive there except phantoms .
precisely .
we suggest that the 8th spirit is a phantom spirit .
i can't explain it until that moment .
but once we get down there ...
wait !
you'll understand ...
wait .
that's the one way trip .
yes .
yes , i expected that's how you'll valuate our chance .
what am i wrong?
no , i agree .
we'll probably won't live long enough
to extract the 8th spirit from the crater ...
then why should we try it?
because we don't need to extract the 8th spirit .
we can bring the final spirit here .
we can go there and complete the wave inside the crater .
yes .
exactly .
and how do we do that ... exactly?
i can construct the device .
that would attach to aki's chest plate together the eight spirits and then ...
and then what?
and then we wait .
and see what happens .
that's it?
that's your plan?
we wait and see what happens?
yes .
oh good .
but i got my own plan .
we keep scanning the surface of orbit .
maybe we'll find the compatible spirit somewhere else .
aki?
i say we go in .
general hein , you're clear to go in to the zero one alpha .
what caused the battle failed , general hein?
i'm afraid it's only the matter of time before the phantoms develop into immunity to our barriers .
but i'm ready to see you and the rest of the council to evacuate to houston without incident .
it was a terrible suffer this evening .
the council had reconsidered your proposal fire the zeus cannon .
i see .
we are transmitting the access code to you now .
and general , best of luck to us all .
prepare to fire the cannon .
target , sir?
the phantom crater .
prepare to drop in three , two , one .
powering the shield .
okay , we are over the mini one .
do you have it inside , doctor .
there are so many of them?
wait .
yes .
i'm tracking the 8th spirit moving along the crater surface .
alright .
now let's take a closer look .
ready to fire in 3 minutes .
overpack set maximum .
transferring class to other .
counter thrusters are engaged .
locks flow the couple .
status is green .
we have something in the radar over the impact side , sir .
it's her .
sir .
just a traitor on the influence of the enemy .
continue the countdown .
we'll take them all out at the same time .
we're closing on the phantom .
contact in 30 seconds .
target locked .
ready to fire on your command .
it's a match .
it's a perfect match .
target's cannon is ready , sir .
fire !
what was that?
it's the zeus .
they're firing on the crater .
aki , gray , are you alright?
a little shaking .
stand by .
sid , the 8th spirit is not on our scanner .
do you have it?
the 8th has been destroyed .
what are we going to do now?
nothing .
this mission is over .
we have to get out of here .
incoming !
what is that?
if you gonna get us out of here , you better do it now .
hold on !
i can't hold on to you .
i'm not able to maintain .
emergency landing procedures .
come in , come in , please
aki , gray , can you hear me?
sid , i need to talk to the station .
can you pass us through?
what is that thing?
i don't know , sir .
incoming message , sir .
general hein , you must cease fire immediately .
what are you looking at , in the crater is the living spirit of an alien's home world .
the planet was destroyed and part of the it landed here .
this is not an invasion .
it never was .
oh , i see .
and what we have been fighting all this time , doctor?
ghosts?
yes , spirits that are confused , lost and angry .
oh right?
and these spirits are coming out of the gaya ,
earth gaya .
doctor , even if i believe in such nonsense .
the fact remains the earth is under attack from aggressor who must be destroyed at all cost .
the cost maybe the entire planet , sir .
fire on the alien gaya would only make it stronger .
since that you under the alien influence , doctor .
i will take your protest to mean , we are in fact persuading the correct course of action .
i suggest you take your last few months and prepare to meet your gaya .
continue to fire until the invaders have been destroyed .
general , this is the mis over hitting .
we are going to hit again and again .
and keep on hitting it , until it's dead .
but sir , we not even sure if it has any affect on the other creature .
no affect .
we got them in the run , soldier .
this is the moment of our victory . order you to fire .
this won't allow us to fire again .
we'll see about that .
now shield is out , we're seeking doc in here .
come on .
this is not a good place to be .
what the hell is that?
that's something i'm thinking , is it?
yes !
it's gaya .
definitely not a good place to be .
are you alright?
i'm fine .
i have to talk to dr. sid .
sid , do you read me?
go ahead .
i'm still here .
we are looking at gaya .
you hear me , sir?
gaya !
i think this explains why the ex spirits appeared here .
yes .
yes , that's it .
a phantom must have changed into the 8th spirit when it starts a new life born on our own gaya .
if so , it would have been given a different energy signature that set apart from the other phantoms .
you two could not have hope for better location to find a new compatible spirit .
whatever you do , don't move .
stay right where you are .
staying right where we are may not be as easy as it sound .
don't shoot any of them .
you could destroy our last hope .
and what do you suggest i do , doctor?
ask them to play nice?
combat strategy is your area of expertise , not mine .
i have a reading here in official .
do you see it?
yes , a compatible spirit .
it must be very near you .
where?
which one is it?
which one?
i'm having difficulty now .
just a moment .
doctor , it's getting crowded in here .
we don't have much time .
aki ... aki !
with the hope of new life , has gaya changed the phantom within?
i have it .
gray , get in here .
i need you .
do you hear me , sid?
the wave pattern is completed .
yes , i read you .
this is wonderful .
i don't see how you could have found the final spirit .
it found me , doctor .
i see now .
i understand .
i don't understand .
what the hell is going on?
give me your overpack .
i need to project it in the complete way .
we'll be defenseless .
i hope you know what you are doing , aki .
we can use the shield to project the wave .
dr sid's theory was right .
i have it , the 8th spirit .
i'm cured , gray .
are you sure you have the final spirit?
yes , yes .
i'm sure .
but how?
how can you know that?
don't worry , the phantom told me .
oh , great .
that's it .
shield on .
it's not working .
we have to do something before it's too late .
if this doesn't work , then it's already too late .
gray ... trust me .
no !
no !
get down !
warning system overload .
i know .
warning system overload .
i know !
but it must be done .
fire !
fire !
damn it !
fire !
gray?
gray !
don't leave me , gray .
i told you this was an one way trip .
looks like i was right .
no , gray .
hang on , please .
i still have the wave .
we can get through this .
we are going to make it .
we are going to make it .
we both know that isn't time .
gray ...
help me .
gray ...
listen to me .
you saved my life once .
now i want you to save yourself .
gray , no .
please .
let me do this , aki .
trust me .
don't leave me , gray .
you have been trying to tell me death isn't the end .
don't back out on me .
now i finally believe .
i love you .
oh , it's warm .
