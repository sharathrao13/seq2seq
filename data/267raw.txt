at the beginning of the 21st century , the umbrella corporation ... had become the largest commercial entity in the united states .
nine out of every ten homes contain its products .
its political and financial influence is felt everywhere .
in public , it is the world's leading supplier ... of computer technology , medical products and health care .
unknown even to its own employees ... its massive profits are generated by military technology ... genetic experimentation and viral weaponry .
all umbrella staff must wear their identity tags at all times .
all radiation badges will be collected at 5 : 00 p . m . this afternoon .
thank you !
god !
some people .
yeah .
don't show this to me .
why not?
because i'm busy .
it's nothing .
fire drill .
what is that?
fire drill .
shit !
hey , what the hell is going on?
get the computers covered !
move it !
damn it , i'm trying !
the experiments !
move them !
shouldn't the doors open or something?
it's supposed to take us to the nearest floor .
what's happening?
line's dead .
what's the problem?
the doors won't open .
what about the ones at the back?
locked as well .
there's no fire here !
no fire !
the code doesn't work !
no fire !
what's wrong with you?
the door won't open !
and this water isn't going anywhere .
what?
it's a sealed room .
help me with the door !
oh , fuck the doors !
we have to get out of here .
what's going on?
has this happened before?
we have to get out of here .
we have to get out of here !
take it easy .
you take it easy !
quiet !
what is that?
oh , my god .
halon !
stop it !
stop it !
stop !
help !
let me see .
we're gonna have to get out of here .
we have to get out of this building !
here , give me a hand .
that's as far as they'll go .
they're caught on something .
that's wide enough .
i can squeeze through .
i'll get help .
i'm stuck .
you're gonna have to push .
that's it .
a bit more .
what was that?
oh , christ !
it's the brakes !
get out !
i can't move !
we have to get out of here !
push her out of the way !
pull me back inside !
pull me back inside !
hello?
who are you?
move !
don't touch me !
stop !
get away from me !
down !
what are you doing?
i'm a cop !
i told you , i'm a cop !
you're breaking my arm !
report .
report now .
what?
i want your report , soldier .
i don't know what you're talking about .
sir , the house's primary defenses have been activated .
she's probably still suffering the side effects .
what are you doing with us?
what about the cop?
matthew addison .
i'm not getting a match .
who are you?
i just transferred .
they probably don't even have me on file yet .
the locals are inefficient .
it's possible .
should i secure him here?
no .
we take him with us .
you can't do this !
blow me .
prep for entry to the hive .
power's down .
so fix it .
i'm on it .
are you done yet?
jumpy .
stand clear !
you got a problem?
how's that door?
it's sealed shut .
let me .
jumpy?
lie still .
lie still !
watch this light .
follow it .
now , how many fingers am i holding up?
three .
good .
now tell me your name .
i don't know .
he's fine .
memory loss , just like the other one .
let's open that door .
listen to me .
i want to know who you people are ... and i want to know what's going on here .
now !
you and i have the same employer .
we all work for the umbrella corporation .
the mansion above us is an emergency entrance to the hive .
you are security operatives placed there to protect that entrance .
what about this?
your marriage is a fake .
just part of your cover to protect the secrecy of the hive .
and what is the hive?
show them .
accessing schematic of the hive .
raccoon city , nearest urban center .
the mansion where we found you ... and through which we gained access to the train ... which , in turn , brought us to the hive .
the hive itself is located underground ... deep beneath the streets of raccoon city .
a top secret research facility ... owned and operated by the umbrella corporation ... the hive houses over 500 technicians , scientists and support staff .
they live and work underground .
their research is of the highest importance .
its nature is classified .
our position on the map is indicated by heat signature .
why can't i remember anything?
the hive has its own defense mechanisms ... all computer controlled .
a nerve gas was released into the house .
primary effect of the gas complete unconsciousness lasting anything up to four hours .
secondary effects are varied , but can include acute memory loss .
for how long?
subjective .
an hour , day , week .
so you're saying this place was attacked?
i'm afraid things are a little more complicated than that .
sir !
we've breached the hive .
j. d.
got it .
halon content has dissipated .
makes it easier to work underground , thinking there's a view .
looks like we're taking the stairs .
status .
red queen is locked onto us .
she knows that we're here .
who's the red queen?
state of the art artificial intelligence .
she is the computer that controls the hive .
this is gonna slow us down .
our route to the queen takes us straight through these labs .
rain , j. d. , see how bad the flooding is .
kaplan , find us an alternate route .
what happened here?
five hours ago , red queen went homicidal .
sealed the hive and killed everyone down here .
jesus .
when we realized what was happening ... my team was dispatched to shut her down .
why did she do it?
that we don't know .
but outside interference is a possibility .
jesus !
hey .
you okay?
here .
no .
i'm fine .
please , come on .
it's cold in here .
are you
do you remember anything from before this?
no .
nothing before the train .
and you?
no .
nothing .
i found an alternate route , but it's gonna cost us time .
we double back , cut through dining hall b ... then we're right on track .
sir , no go .
the whole level's flooded .
all right , we're behind schedule .
so let's move it .
come on .
poor bastards .
dining hall b.
that's what it says on the map .
maybe you're reading it wrong .
maybe the corporation's keeping a few secrets down here .
something you're not supposed to see .
j. d. , you and rain keep the prisoner here and secure the exit .
sir , halon levels are nonexistent in this room .
i think the system malfunctioned .
all right .
there may be survivors .
give me a search line , but keep it tight .
move it .
i said keep it tight .
sorry .
i'm not sure i want to remember what went on down here .
i don't blame you .
what do they keep in these things?
how do i know?
what's taking so long?
red queen's defenses are in place .
she's making it difficult .
let's pack it up .
you stay here .
the lights are automated .
nothing to worry about .
transmitter in position .
roger .
running the bypass .
checkmate .
move up .
what is that?
that's what will shut the queen down .
delivers a massive electrical charge .
scrambles the mainframe and forces it to reboot .
some kind of dormant defense mechanism .
opening the door tripped it .
put it back to sleep .
working on it .
would you open that door now , please?
i'm trying .
hold your positions .
everyone stay calm .
what's that?
kaplan , quick !
we gotta get them out of there !
kaplan , you've gotta hurry !
come on !
down !
get down !
look out !
something's killing them !
jesus !
come on , man .
don't do this to me !
medic !
medic !
open the door !
open this door !
i am trying .
stay conscious .
you're going into shock .
stay awake !
i am almost there .
sir !
it's coming back !
open the door !
i'm trying !
well , try harder !
it's coming back !
oh , god !
just do it !
i'm almost there .
come on !
shit !
got it .
all right .
let's do it .
do what?
we have to complete the mission .
there is no way i'm going down there .
her defenses are down .
dj vu , anyone?
keep going .
give me a hand .
get out !
get out !
you can't be in here .
don't listen to anything she says .
she's a holographic representation of the red queen .
you have to get out !
modeled after the head programmer's daughter .
she'll try to deceive us , confuse us .
i wouldn't advise this .
disabling me will result in loss of primary power .
she'll say anything to stop us from shutting her down .
i implore you .
implore away .
please?
please?
you're all going to die down here .
that pulse forces the circuit breaker to shut down her mainframe for 30 seconds .
after that , if i don't have her board , she can reboot .
they're late .
i'm on it .
j. d. , we got a survivor !
it's okay .
we're here to help .
you seem to be in some serious
get off of me !
get off of me !
j. d. , get her off of me before i stab her ass !
are you okay?
she bit me , man .
she took a chunk clean right out of me .
stay down .
i'm warning you , stay down !
she's crazy .
come any closer , and i'll fire .
i mean it !
damn you .
i shot her five times .
how was she still standing?
bitch isn't standing now .
what was all the shooting?
we found a survivor .
and you shot him?
she was crazed .
she bit me .
she's gone .
she's gone !
that's bullshit !
she fell right here , but she's gone !
look , look at this .
there's blood , but it's not much .
looks like it's coagulated .
yeah .
it's not possible .
why not?
because blood doesn't do that till after you're dead .
can we go now?
we're not going anywhere till the rest of the team get here .
there's no one else coming .
what the fuck are you talking about?
wait .
quiet .
fuck !
don't come any closer !
they're behind us .
jesus !
they're everywhere .
they're everywhere .
they're all around us .
i said stay back !
why aren't they dying?
watch the tank !
the tank !
let's go !
hurry up !
wait !
come on , let's go !
move !
keep moving !
come on !
move !
i can help you get the virus .
i have access to security codes , surveillance plans , the works .
shit !
we lost the others !
keep moving !
you waited?
didn't know the code .
come on , come on .
shit !
come on .
come on .
hurry up .
come on , man .
shit !
what's taking so long?
i'm trying !
come on .
move !
what's the code?
hurry up !
i'm running out of ammo !
zero , four , three , two no , five !
what?
zero , four , three
what is the code?
zero , four ... zero , three , one ... nine , six , five .
got it?
see how easy that was?
shit !
j. d. , no !
grab my hand , man !
come on !
don't let go !
j. d. !
rain !
where are the bodies?
where did they go?
fuck !
whatever they are , there's too many of them out there .
whatever they are?
it's pretty obvious what they are .
lab coats , badges .
those people used to work here !
all the people working here are dead .
well , that isn't stopping them from walking around .
well , where did they come from?
why didn't we see them on the way in?
when you cut the power , you unlocked the doors .
you let them out .
we're never gonna make it to the surface .
you are security operatives .
security operatives placed there to protect that entrance .
i've got one in the breech and an extra mag .
lisa?
i can help you get the virus .
i have access to security codes , surveillance plans , the works .
but?
but there's gonna be a price .
name it .
who was she?
my sister .
corporations like umbrella think they're above the law .
but they're not .
there are hundreds of thousands of us who think the same ... all over the world .
some of us provide information ... others give their support .
some take more direct action .
like you .
if your friends had been a little more thorough ... they would've seen right through my false id .
then all the red flags would've gone off
quantico , nsa , vicap , all the rest .
there's no way i could've infiltrated the hive .
so you sent your sister .
we needed something concrete .
anything to expose umbrella to the press .
proof of the research that was going on down here .
what kind of research?
the illegal kind .
genetic .
viral .
my sister was going to smuggle out ... a sample of the virus they were developing .
so how was she going to make it out of here?
she had a contact within the hive , someone i never met .
they had access to security codes , surveillance , everything she needed .
so why didn't she make it?
maybe she trusted the wrong person .
maybe they set her up .
kept the virus for themselves .
do you know how much the t virus would be worth on the open market?
what , worth all this?
yeah .
to someone .
don't shoot !
don't shoot !
close that door !
they're right behind us !
get off !
get off !
stop it !
son of a bitch !
you okay?
yeah .
right behind us .
what about this door?
they're waiting out there too .
and that way?
it's a dead end .
there's no way out of the queen's chamber .
so we wait .
if someone doesn't hear from you , they'll send backup or something .
right?
what?
what's wrong?
we don't have much time .
you know those blast doors we passed ... on the way in from the mansion?
they seal shut in just under an hour .
if we're not out of here by then , we're not getting out .
what are you talking about?
they can't just bury us alive down here .
containing the incident is the only fail safe plan they had ... against possible contamination .
and you're only telling us this now , when we're trapped ... half a mile underground?
we have to find a way out of this room .
what are you doing?
where are you taking those?
i'm turning her back on .
that is not a good idea .
she'll know a way out of here .
that homicidal bitch killed my team .
that homicidal bitch may be our only way out of here .
considering the way she's being treated , i'm sure she'll be happy to help us out .
that circuit breaker you were talking about .
can you bypass it?
yeah .
so do it .
all right , circuit breaker is disabled .
this time if i hit the switch , she won't be able to shut down .
she's gonna fry .
kaplan?
the initial charge must have damaged her boards .
ah , there you are .
things , i gather , have gone out of control .
give me that fucking switch right now .
i'm gonna fry your ass .
i did warn you , didn't i?
tell us what's going on down here .
research and development .
what about the t virus?
the t virus was a major medical breakthrough ... although it clearly also possessed highly profitable military applications .
how does it explain those things out there?
even in death , the human body still remains active .
hair and fingernails continue to grow .
new cells are produced ... and the brain itself holds a small electrical charge ... that takes months to dissipate .
the t virus provides a massive jolt ... both to cellular growth ... and to those trace electrical impulses .
put quite simply ... it reanimates the body .
it brings the dead back to life?
not fully .
the subjects have the simplest of motor functions .
perhaps a little memory .
virtually no intelligence .
they are driven by the basest of impulses ... the most basic of needs .
which is?
the need to feed .
how do you kill them?
severing the top of the spinal column or massive trauma to the brain ... are the most effective methods .
you mean shoot them in the head .
why did you kill everybody down here?
the t virus escaped into the air conditioning system ... and an uncontrolled pattern of infection began .
the virus is protean ... changing from liquid to airborne to blood transmission ... depending on its environment .
it's almost impossible to kill .
i couldn't allow it to escape from the hive ... so i took steps .
steps .
you must understand .
those who become infected , i can't allow you to leave .
whoa .
we're not infected .
just one bite , one scratch from these creatures is sufficient ... and then you become one of them .
a check of my systems indicates my main drive circuit breaker ... has been disabled .
may i ask why?
insurance .
we need a way out of here .
if you refuse to help at any time , we flip the switch .
understand?
after you .
what the hell is this place?
the utility tunnels .
they run underneath the hive for water , gas and power lines .
it's been in here before .
keep moving .
we're going around in circles .
this is the route the computer gave us .
why are you listening to her?
enough already !
we have no choice but to keep moving 'cause those things are right behind us .
that mesh isn't gonna hold .
keep moving .
jesus christ !
hold it !
there's too many of them !
jesus !
fuck !
up on the pipes .
up on the pipes !
quickly , everyone !
let's go !
come on !
there's a way up !
watch out !
keep 'em back !
go on up !
move it !
shit .
okay .
get over here !
there's too many of them !
come on !
go , go , go !
go on !
go !
go !
i can manage !
gotcha !
rain?
rain .
what?
we have to do something about your wounds .
i'm fine .
i said i'm fine .
you like that , don't you?
huh?
you like the way it tastes , don't you?
like the taste of that?
she was right .
we're all gonna die down here .
no .
we're getting out .
all of us .
kaplan , are you okay?
oh , god !
hold on !
help him .
i can't .
what are you waiting for?
i can't focus !
i can't see !
kaplan , go up !
get up there !
you almost got it .
keep going !
come on !
come on !
you can do it !
you got it !
okay , kaplan .
just stay there !
hold on .
we're gonna come get you .
cut this wire and throw it to him .
then we can go get him .
hold on !
that's lucky .
i want you to go .
we're not leaving you , kaplan .
yes , you are .
you can't kill all of them .
and i'm not going anywhere .
i want you to go .
now !
please .
just do it .
just do it now !
please .
go !
you're gonna have to work for your meal !
come on .
give me your arm .
up over my shoulder .
ready?
there we go .
when i get out of here ...
i think i'm gonna get laid .
yeah .
you might want to clean up a little bit first .
hey , wait .
are you okay?
blue for the virus .
green for the antivirus .
there's a cure .
what are you talking about?
there's a cure .
the process can be reversed .
there's a cure !
you're gonna be okay !
i was beginning to worry .
this is where they kept the t virus .
how do you know all this?
because i was gonna steal it .
i was your sister's contact .
you betrayed her .
i don't know .
you caused all of this .
i can't remember .
the truth .
i don't remember the truth .
i don't understand !
it's gone .
it's not there .
i can't .
i just can't .
it's over .
i can help you get the virus .
i have access to security codes , surveillance plans , the works .
but there's gonna be a price .
name it .
you have to guarantee me that you will bring this corporation down .
spence?
thank you .
spence?
we can still make it out of here .
come with me .
we can have everything we've ever wanted .
money's out there waiting .
you wouldn't believe how much .
is that how you thought all my dreams were gonna come true?
please .
i wouldn't want to shoot you .
might need the bullets .
back off .
i won't take any part in this .
okay , but you can't just ... wash your hands of this .
we work for the same company .
you knew what they did .
i was trying to stop them .
you really believe that ... people like him ... will ever change anything?
nothing ... ever changes .
where is ... the antivirus?
it's on the train ... where you found me .
couldn't have been standing more than three feet from it .
i so nearly made it out .
didn't realize that bitch of a computer had defense systems outside the hive .
in or out?
in ... or out?
i don't know what we had ... but it's over .
back ... the fuck off .
i'm missing you already .
your boyfriend's a real asshole .
he shot the locking mechanism out .
i can't believe that son of a bitch is gonna get away with this .
i don't think so .
i've been a bad , bad girl .
oh , my god .
what the fuck is that?
one of the hive's early experiments ... produced by injecting the t virus directly into living tissue .
the results were unstable .
now that it has fed on fresh dna , it will mutate ...
becoming a stronger , faster hunter .
great .
if you knew it was loose , why didn't you warn us?
'cause she was saving it for us .
isn't that right?
i didn't think any of you would make it this far .
not without infection .
why didn't you tell us about the antivirus?
this long after infection ... there's no guarantee it would work .
but there's a chance , right?
i don't deal in chance .
fuck it .
no pressure , guys .
you require the four digit access code .
i can give you the code , but first you must do something for me .
what do you want?
one of your group is infected .
i require her life for the code .
the antivirus is right there on the platform .
it's right there !
i'm sorry .
it's a risk i cannot take .
she's right .
it's the only way .
you're gonna have to kill me .
otherwise we all die down here .
the glass is reinforced ... but it won't hold forever .
do it .
no .
get up .
just do it .
rain , please get up .
do it !
you don't have long to decide .
get up , please .
you have no choice .
kill her .
kill her now .
you don't have any choice .
just do it now !
i can't !
please .
do it .
kill her .
just do it .
kill her now !
kill her !
the bitch wouldn't open the door , so i had to fry her .
move .
what the fuck was that?
it's a long story .
start it up .
i'll get the virus .
i'm missing you already .
okay , we're in business .
full power .
we're leaving !
i don't want to be one of those things ... walking around without a soul .
you won't .
when the time comes ... you'll take care of it .
no one else is gonna die .
okay?
here .
i'm not dead yet .
i think i'll have that back .
i could kiss you , you bitch .
what's going on back there?
get us the fuck out of here !
any faster , we'll come off the rails !
open the doors !
open the doors !
now !
i failed all of them .
i failed .
listen to me .
there is nothing else you could've done .
the corporation's guilty here , not you .
and we finally have the proof .
that way umbrella can't get get away with this .
what is it?
you're infected , but you're gonna be okay .
i'm not losing you .
help !
help him .
what are you doing?
matt !
he's mutating .
i want him in the nemesis program .
get off !
what's happening?
matt !
i want her quarantined .
close observation and a full series of blood tests .
let's see if she's infected .
take her to the raccoon city facility .
then assemble the team .
we're reopening the hive .
i want to know what went on down there .
just do it .
who's in there?
let me out !
let me out !
who's in there?
