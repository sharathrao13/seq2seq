a case in point in anger's ability to change us is my mother .
my mother was always the nicest person i ever knew .
she was the nicest , sweetest woman than anyone who knew her ever knew .
then things changed ... then she changed .
she got angry .
good and angry .
anger has turned my mother into a very sad and bitter woman .
if she wasn't my mother , i'd slap her .
i would .
i'd look her straight in the face and tell her what i really think of her ... and then i'd run really fast in the opposite direction .
are you eating?
yes .
i want you eating .
i mean it .
okay .
you ladies are old enough now ,
i'm not gonna pull any punches here .
he took his wallet ... and he left .
when he didn't come home the other night , you know , i thought we got lucky and he was just in a car crash , dead by the side of the road , but the fact is , he's run off with his little swedish secretary , who , oh , what a coincidence , mysteriously left work three days ago and moved back to sweden !
but where did he go?
have you spoken to him?
no , i haven't spoken to him .
there is very little to say .
he knows that .
but i did cut off all his goddamn credit cards .
closed his checking account , yeah .
see how long she sticks around when he's broke .
your father is a ... small man .
very small .
i hope that's not an allusion to the man's genitals
'cause that'd just be gross .
aw , dude ,
i was about to eat a string bean .
oh , my god ...
excuse me , excuse me .
everything is not a joke .
i am talking .
and as a jittery nation worries about a counterstrike , we'll go to the scene of the anthrax scare in florida .
sheesh .
hey .
hey , terry .
what do you want?
well , i i ...
i wanted to talk to you and grey about them building that subdivision back there?
yeah?
he's so , um ...
he's so damned set against it , he hasn't even heard the proposal .
grey doesn't live here anymore , denny .
he doesn't exist .
go away .
officials tell us that they are worried about how to manage the fragile us led coalition in the days ahead , but the facts are already evident from south asia , to africa , to the middle east .
worldwide , thousands of angry demonstrators are taking to the streets to protest us military ...
the least he could have done was taken this stupid jock with him .
there have been plenty of protests in the world .
and i suspect ...
ugh .
what ... what ... what do you mean , " he doesn't exist "?
oh .
are you stoned?
yeah .
oh ...
jesus .
what do you ... what do you mean ,
he ... he doesn't exist "?
he's been messing around with his assistant .
go talk about it on the radio .
no , i'm ...
i'm ... no , i'm i'm ...
i'm i'm be ...
i'm being serious .
i need ...
i need to talk to him .
um ...
he left me .
he left you?
mm .
for danken shane or whatever his secretary's name is , so denny you can go ahead and build your ... damn subdivision back there ...
i don't know , whatever it is you want .
it was him who had the problem with it , not me , okay?
he left you?
yes .
really?
yeah .
hey , i'm sorry , terry .
you know , go ahead and build your houses back there , denny .
he's gone .
he won't stop ...
they're not my houses .
they're not .
i'm just , um ...
i'm just the front man , you know , wave the world series ring .
they get the sales , i'm getting a free lot out of it .
ooh , a free lot .
hmm .
it's something shep set up .
he really left?
really?
this is ... true?
yeah .
hey , come on .
just go away .
hey .
well ... ah ... look , let me come in .
come on , if yo ... if you don't want ,
i won't talk .
i'll just sit there and i'll drink with you .
there was a large mob ... of angry demonstrators here today , proving that a number of people are willing to go and fight .
the feeling is that ...
i got her to school .
thank you .
you know i'm going back to school in the morning , you're gonna get her yourself tomorrow .
billy edwards on my bus says that when you get really drunk , you get friendly and you sign baseballs without bitching about it .
he does?
yeah .
so , you got any baseballs around?
no .
why don't you run down the street to my house .
i got a ... stack of boxes in my garage .
there's a key under my mat .
you grab one of those boxes .
you bring it back here .
one box .
anything she makes ...
i'm gonna split with her .
buddy , goddamn you !
out !
what's the big deal?
he wasn't licking it more than three seconds .
the three second thing is for floors , not dogs 'mouths .
he spends all day licking other dogs 'asses .
oh , let's just call for take out .
it's fine .
you guys , it's good chicken .
it's fine .
like you'd eat it?
it's fine .

you know what , that's really sick .
how's dinner coming?

um , can you make an extra plate?
denny's staying for dinner .
that was quick .
what was quick?
what was quick?
denny? !

my life is falling apart at this moment .
i expect some compassion from you .
now you go back up to school tomorrow , come back home at christmas break and bust my hump if you want to , but right this minute , i want the benefit of the doubt at every turn !
are we clear?
yes .
thank you .
mm , this looks good .
what kind of a dick head runs away with his secretary?
that is lame .
take a right , make a left at pathetic .
i think he's coming back home .
maybe not soon , but ...
i do .
i think we should call him .
and say what?
hey dad , how's your new life going so far?
i got an a in interpretive dance .
he doesn't care about you , emily .
get real .
he lost his job , hadley .
what?
your father was about to be laid off .
he was told a few months ago .
he was devastated .
he didn't want you girls to know it .
okay?
i think he flipped out or something .
i read this article on the internet .
apparently , it's common .
they lose their jobs , and they go nuts .
what do you want from me?
it's the best that i can come up with .
i don't want anything from you .
well , don't take it out on me , hadley .
you aren't gonna have to be here .
you aren't gonna know how empty this house is gonna be .
well , if it makes you feel any better , i hate him too .
oh , does that mean you hate me?
you are such a mental .
i have to go , okay?
all right .
i'll see you later , okay?
terry .

terry ann wolfmeyer .
you're getting no play .
on 101 wrlf detroit .

i got enough problems .
okay , well , then while we're at it , don't knock my dating habits , okay?
'cause they keep me young .

to david and hadley .
a long and beautiful partnership .
aww .

the ... mostly right now ...
i'm sorry , david , this is very emotional for me .
to my baby .
my first born , my little hadley wadley .
aww .
that's what we called her .
hadley wadley .
she was so loved from the minute she was born .
just an adorable little thing .
she was ... well , she grew up too fast didn't she?
she grew up so fast and had a mouth on her .
mother !
when she was in her teens she was her own little boss .
mother !
and she would sometimes just not come home ...
all right , could we just toast , please?
thank you .
okay , baby .
we'll toast .
you have to forgive me .
um ... you all had a chance to process this , and i'm just coming on board , so to speak .
to hadley wadley .
hadley wadley .
mmn .
oh .
oh !
oh , no , no .
i'm done toasting .
i'm just ordering another drink .
it was horrible .
maybe it wasn't .
maybe it wasn't as bad as you thought .
no , it was horrible .
it was .
i made an ass of myself .
i was like ... a public service film against drinking .
just ... yeah , i was an old lush .
poor hadley .
i feel so bad for her , denny .
why are we going out here?
i hate the way i come off to my girls .
i just hate that i can't control my emotions .
oh god .
this is creepy .
this was all a farm owned by the ...
firestone family until the 50's .
this and the whole subdivision .
it goes on a bit about another eight acres .
why are we out here today?
i wanna do it .
out here?
no .
don't be an asshole .
i wanna sell my part of it .
just let your friends develop the lots and tell them " yes .
tell them i don't need the money , though .
if they think i need the money , they'll play games with me .
do you?
no .
yes .
no .
i don't know .
i'm in some trouble ... unless i officially divorce the shitbox which i refuse to do , until at least he has the balls to show his face .
i wanna give the girls the money .
just tell your friend shep i want to make the deal .
what?
nothin '.
good .
i'm going in .
this place is a clearinghouse for lime disease .
hey , this is cute .
shep ...
how are you , pal?
i'm doing great .
i'm hanging with andy , how could i not be?
hello , terry .
hadley ...
hadley's boyfriend .
okay , okay .
we're gonna go watch a movie .
isn't that sweet?
the bicycle thief .
she's never seen " the bicycle thief .
he's a nut for foreign cinema .
anyone wanna join us?
snuggle up on the couch?
watch a classic?
i think we'll , uh , probably pass .
is it the subtitles?
you know me too well .
i do and it's a burden .
i know him too well ...
okay .
so it's a burden .
that's it .
okay .
i cannot tell you how much this thing disgusts me .
oh , come on .
she's doing great at work .
shep's got her producing morning drive time , plus ...
i think he really likes her .
oh , the whole thing just infuriates me .
that's probably half the attraction .
what?
you know what .
not another word .
the deep hatred that men have felt for one another through the ages has blossomed into one chapter after another of repression , violence , hate , rape , religious slang and genocide .
i'm still working on it .
i need to fix the music .
it's my final in television production .
you're really handsome , gorden .
thanks .
i should go .
i really do have to go .
the power of stress and naked anger is seen over and over again in the relationships that exist between the male and the female of our species .
here , in rural botswana , an unfaithful tribeswoman is brought to a field by a group of locals for a ritualized punishment of beating and harassment .
events quickly spiral out of control for the tribesmen , though as the woman's fury becomes too great to contain and the men are quickly forced to flee for their safety .
why am i not excited by it?
um , because i don't think any of these new age arts colleges are really colleges .
of course , it's a college .
what are you talking about?
honey , i've been there .
i have .
i wanted to be a poet , remember?
just take arts courses at ann arbor .
i don't want to go to school in ann arbor .
no , of course you don't .
it's what i want you to do .
why would you?
okay , four years learning dance theory?
i have a theory about that .
it's not going to happen .
how's the show?
you enjoying it?
i wish you would take me seriously .
honey , i take you seriously .
i just don't think you have much capacity for self evaluation .
you know , you'd think you'd be happy for me ... considering the way your life turned out .
the way your parents pushed you ...
to marry your father?
yeah .
i'm not complaining .
they pushed me to take life seriously ... not to live in the clouds .
do you have any idea what a fucking idiot you sound like sometimes?
i love how you worry that the letter you sent to the parent who deserted you is too mean , and yet , to the one who's here in the fight , you have no problem saying the most vile things .
isn't that a tad odd?
please finish setting the table .
fuck you !
shep , wake up .
wake up , wake up .
hey .
oh , it's 5 : 00 .
okay , 5 : 00 .
just ...
no , my mother's downstairs we need to get up .
we need to get up right ...
ah , hello !
okay , not now .
we need to get ...
no , we need to get up .
and ...
my ...
g ...
god !
wow .
that was weird , huh?
yeah .
and according to a recent report , the average male waist size in the united states has increased four sizes in the last 10 years .
from 34 to 38 .
see , here's my question .
when are they going to stop calling it 'average? '
just start calling it what it is .
fat ass !
you have a fat ass !
say something to her .
go in there .
no .
do you mind if i do?
yes , i do mind .
quite a bit .
all right .
well ...
well what?
well ...
i didn't quite actually have the end of that thought worked out .
it's late .
i think you should go home , denny .
i think it's going to be nothing but trouble , you staying here tonight .
well , if you want me to leave , just say so .
that was a joke .
... english national ballet school under the direction of katherine wade perform their highly acclaimed production ...
can we talk?
not now , i have a stomachache .
well , can i get you anything?
no , but you can shut the door .
i'm gay .
what?
no .
no , no , no .
you're not .
yeah .
i am .
are you lying to get out of kissing me?
have you ever had gay sex?
what about sex with a woman?
look , you can't be gay if you haven't tried it .
or at least tried it with a girl to know that you don't like it with girls .
no .
i like men , because i'm gay .
i think you're lying .
i do , and i think it's mean .
have sex with me .
just try it and then , if you want to be gay , you can be gay .
that's nice of you .
hi .
um , i came to apologize .
did you?
i did .
i've been a real shit to you .
yes , you have .
what's this?
well , i just want to do something nice for you .
i want to clean your house .
what if i don't want my house cleaned?
well , come on .
just don't be defensive and shitty because i've been shitty .
let us in , okay?
no .
no .
no , come on .
we're not gonna destroy it , we're gonna clean it .
i don't want my house cleaned , terry , okay?
i just want you to be nice to me , okay?
you know something?
what?
nothing .
right .
then move , i'm coming in to clean .
these ... are all inventoried , okay?
i know how many boxes are here .
and what does that mean?
you know what it means .
i don't know this crew .
you don't either .
this is why i don't like people over .
i don't like too many people knowing what i have here .
they're balls , denny , not gold bullion .
yeah , well ... say what you want but they keep me in firewood .
i do what i have to do .
i'm not ashamed .
i didn't say you should be .
other ...
other guys i played with , they , uh ... pulled car dealerships out their asses , you know , ran insurance companies after they retired?
that wasn't me .
i get by , though .
you wanna have a drink?
you know me pretty well , what do you think?
so what is it about you and baseball?
aw , come on , why don't you just call in to the show if you're gonna hit me with that one .
come on , really .
what are you so touchy about?
nothing .
i'm just not sure what they want from me anymore , you know?
it was good .
it was grand .
nice .
next .
it's over .
i don't want to talk about it anymore .
and i realize i'm a walking contradiction .
you know , hocking balls ... going to malls , having my picture taken in a room full of fat fucks .
it's just ... you know , it's ...
i'm ...
i'm tired , okay?
i'm just ...
yeah , i know .
moving ahead is hard .
no , i don't have a problem with moving ahead .
you know what it is i like about going over to your house , terry?
i like how it smells .
something's always cooking .
my house doesn't smell like that .
and i don't even mind going over there when there's tension , and there's a ... there's a fucking lot of it , you know?
somebody is always mad at somebody .
doors are slammin '.
fur's flyin '.
even when no one is talkin ', it's ... it's loud .
but at least it's fucking real .
believe me , this is not where i saw my life going , okay?
this is not how i would've drawn it .
but i'm okay with all of it .
well ...
lucky me .
no .
no .
lucky me .
when i'm with you , terry ... with your girls ...
i feel like there's a big chunk of my life still left to be played out .
and that's what i want to talk about , not ... baseball .
i've had my heart broken really badly , denny .
i know .
it's not the kind of thing that ever heals .
yeah , it does .
it heals .
it just heals funny .
you know , you more or less walk ... with a limp .
well , we'll ... we'll figure out a way to be okay with that .
you know ... with the limp .
# oh , she may be weary #
# and young girls , they do get weary #
# wearing that ... #
# mm hmm . #
i'm showing .
i can't ...
i'm so pissed off i'm showing .
well , you're not showing that bad .
another two weeks , and we'd have to elope .
i have to go get my bracelet .
i hate the fact that so many people know she's pregnant .
half of them , she's told .
i think she's actually
proud of herself for this .
what's the big deal?
she would have gotten married anyway .
i know , sweetie , she's a doll .
i just wish she could learn to keep her goddamn mouth shut .
hey .
do i look horrible?
no .
tell me the truth .
are you kidding?
you ... are ... a beautiful , gorgeous bride .
i am?
yes .
you are .
you look perfect in that dress .
elegant and classy and sexy and fresh and your skin looks great .
and your face is big and plump and healthy looking .
oh , i could just eat you up !
my face is plump?
oh , god .
no , i didn't ...
my ...
i didn't mean plump as in plump .
you said my face looks plump .
no , i meant plump like " adorable .
liar !
i did !
sweetheart ...
i have a fat face on my wedding day and you ... you know it !
you do not have a fat face , a plump face , she didn't mean it , i swear .
she just told me my face looked fat .
sweetheart ... honey ...
you're ... wh ... 10 minutes before my wedding ceremony?
that's just mean .
well , what about all the beautiful things that i said with that?
can we focus on those?
right , right , right .
nice fat face , hadley .
go get married .
hadley !
ha ...
hadley ...
okay .
she'll be fine . ... what potential the bonds of marriage hold for us .
to walk together into the fog of the future .
two partners , together ... in concert ... in tandem ... in holy matrimony .
is any bond as sacred as this one?
is any promise more permanent?
# girl #
# you'll be a woman #
# soon #
# i love you so much can't count all the ways #
# i'd die for you girl and all they can say is #
# " he's not your kind " #
# they never get tired of putting me down #
# and i'll never know when i come around #
# what i'm gonna find #
# don't let them make up your mind # emily .
would you like to dance with me?
i don't think so .
i have a stomachache right now .
oh , bullshit .
come on . # you'll be a woman soon # come on .
i don't ...
i don't want her or any of them to judge me . # please # okay . # come take my hand # i don't want them judging me either .

coke?
not drinking today?
okay , nice talking to you .
# have you heard the news? #
# it's all over town , if you ain't heard it boys #
# you'd better sit down # what is your problem?
i don't have a problem .
i'm having a nice day .
running around with young women half your age .
i mean , what is that about?
you manipulate young women , use your power and title to seduce them , and get them to run around with you .
yeah , so?
it makes me sick , the thought of you with my daughter .
well , here's a tip .
don't think about it .
goddamn .
# betty lou's getting out tonight #
# betty lou's getting out tonight #
# betty lou's getting out tonight #
# she was bad , her mama got mad #
# but her mama said it's all right #
who should i sleep with , terry?
women like you? # betty lou's getting out tonight # your age?
my age?
i don't .
you know why? # betty lou #
'cause younger women are nice . # it's all true #
you take them out , they're actually grateful .
" oh , look a steak .
yummy . " # it's really true #
you go for a walk after dinner the air smells nice .
they say , " thank you .
this was nice .
this was fun .
you're funny .
tee hee .
what should i do , terry?
settle down and marry some pissed off thing like you?
i'd rather have someone come over and do dental work every day , from my backside up through my ass .
# come on !
play it , betty lou #
you gonna slap me in the face again?
no , probably not .
# oh , come on ! #
# have you heard the news? #
# it's all over town #
# if you ain't heard it , boys , you'd better sit down #
a vodka and orange juice , please .
# brace yourself now and take a deep breath #
# grab hold of something , gotta hold on tight #
# betty lou's getting out tonight # there you are .
# first heard the rumor down on 12th and main ... #
what did you just say to shep?
nothing .
he left .
he told me he couldn't handle you anymore .
what did you say?
we had a heart to heart .
it was needed .
# betty lou's getting out tonight #
# betty lou's getting out tonight #
# betty lou's getting out tonight #
dance with me . # she was bad , her mama got mad #
# but her mama said it's all right #
# all the boys are getting ready and right #
# betty lou's getting out tonight #
# betty lou #
# betty lou #
# it's all true #
# it's really true #
# well what do you think about that , boys? #
# come on #
mmm , no .
yes?

emily , what's up?
hold ... hold on .
hold on .
it's ... it's emily .
she's in the hospital .
what?
baby?
i should go with you .
no .
i should go with you , terry .
no .
that's a long drive this time of night .
oh , no .
i need you to stay here in case popeye wakes up .
i don't want her to be scared , okay?
i'll be fine .
# can i help it if i'm bolder? #
# can i help it if i'm faithful? #
at this point , i can't say much .
could be an ulcer , could be pancreatic .
i don't know .
i'm at a loss for tonight .
what?
you're at a loss?
she's in a lot of pain .
i had to put her out and let her sleep .
i can't do anything until the morning .
well , what are you gonna do in the morning?
actually , i won't be here in the morning .
i'm at the end of a long shift , but tests will be taken and tomorrow night , when i come back
i'll look at them and we'll talk .
tomorrow night?
yes .
and what if i want a second opinion?
well , i haven't given you a first one yet .
and if i want a second opinion?
it's 4 : 30 am .
i don't think you're going to get a strong one .
well , why would they do something like that?
because i didn't give them candy , that's why .
great .
you're standing at the door with a bowl of candy , why can't you ...
because i don't accept 15 year old girls with no costume on .
if you don't have a costume on ,
you shouldn't be allowed ...
who cares? !
they're just using halloween to get candy !
who cares? !
it's halloween !
just give them candy !
it's okay to use a holiday for your own selfish purposes? !
oh , so what? !
so you'd rather just have them toiletpaper your house?
well , i didn't know it was gonna be " felony or treat !
i don't ...
i didn't think that trick extended to felony !
why would it kill you just to give 'em a few pieces of candy? !
i don't understand that !
because there's gotta be some kind of cut off !
shouldn't there be for halloween?
bob , what is with you and your cut offs and your shouldn't there be and should there be ... who cares? !
she's really sick .
and the worst thing is they don't know what it is .
i mean , it could be an ulcer , it could be thyroid .
it , uh ...
she can't eat and ... you know , it could be cancer .
it could be ... it could be so many things .
i don't know what it is .
i don't know what it is .
oh god .
directory assistance .
um , yes , operator .
i would like , um ,
i'm looking for directory assistance for karlstad , sweden .
you said " karlstad , sweden?
yes , thank you .
look at you all alone in here .
i like it like this .
did you call daddy to tell him?
um ...
no , i didn't .
i don't hate him .
i mean , you know , i know that you do , but i've , uh , been thinking about it , and i just don't .
did you talk to the doctor?
yes .
did he tell you it wasn't cancer?
yes , he did .
thank god .
he thinks that whatever it is might be stress related .
an ulcer , maybe .
he's very worried that you're under too much stress , emily .
i'm not stressed .
yes , you are .
you are .
you're mad .
mad at me .
mad at daddy .
i can see that all the time .
you've got a cloud over your head .
we need to get it to go away .
give you some air .
the doctor's very worried , emily .
maybe yoga .
stop it .
i'm serious .
well , so am i.
you can't dance or exercise your way out of this .
you need to get better , emily .
i can take a lot , but i couldn't take losing you .
why is that funny?
because you just don't seem to care all that much about me , unless , like now , i'm sick .
that's not true .
that's just not true .
i adore you .
you do?
i do !
i don't see that .
well , what can i say?
you're like everybody else in my life you need to pay closer attention to me .
okay .
how's the wind , dad?
fantastic !
whoa !
yeah !
far out !
woo !
the only thing i understand about this ... is the screaming .
whoo !
hey , hey !
so , how does this work now?
you going next , gorden?
hell no .
he won't jump .
he's too scared .
he's a watcher .
you're not gonna jump?
no , he won't jump .
i'll go again , unless you wanna take a shot .
nope .
not me .
i'm a watcher too .
are you gonna marry my mother?
i don't know .
it's , um ... it's tough .
your mom , she's ... she's tricky .
she didn't used to be .
ask anyone .
she was always sweet .
you should marry her , denny .
would that make you happy?
it would , yeah .
mmn .
so , uh ... your daughter asked me if i was going to marry you , today .
oh , please .
that's a cheap shot .
what do you mean?
she's , um ... she's adorable .
i know she is .
it wasn't a cheap shot , terry .
what?
bringing up what ... bringing up what popeye said .
it wasn't , um ... it wasn't a cheap shot .
i have enough problems right now , denny .
i don't need you using my daughter as a pawn .
what are you talking about?
i have a child incredibly ill in the hospital .
another one's sleeping with a pervert that you brought into her life , so i don't want to get into something silly
like a cute talk about a marriage that we both know would be doomed from the start , so you know what i'm talking about .
don't .
i don't wanna hear what popeye said , no .
i am so sick of being your bitch .
i put up with your shit , because i know how much pain you're in .
but it's enough !
it's a tall order for a patient motherfucker , and i am the farthest thing from that that you're ever gonna lay eyes on .
... tomorrow .
denny?
can i talk to you for a second?
yeah , i i i can do this tomorrow .
bad news .
you ready?
management has a bug up their ass .
okay , they've been getting a lot of calls .
i've been trying to keep this from you , but they want to renegotiate .
renegotiate what?
come on , you know what .
they want you to talk baseball .
what?
either that or they want to take us off the air .
good gag .
it's not a gag , denny .
i wish it was a gag .
it's not a gag .
you either talk baseball , or we go off the air next week .
i don't wanna talk baseball .
big deal .
they didn't want to have a sports talk show in the middle of a day with an all rock format , but i talked them into it .
guess what?
you're a baseball star .
that's what people want to hear from you .
baseball talk .
nobody wants to hear your cooking and your stock tips , denny .
i'm sorry , but it's true .
saturday .
baseball talk .
they may even promo it .
okay , arthur , you're on in 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 ... better yet , you're on .

he's with the nanny , we needed a night off .
so it's done?
they're gonna build a subdivision back there?
yeah , next month , they break ground .
it's gonna change the view .
the view could use changing .
she's coming , okay?
big smiles ... and compliments , but normal though .
everything's normal , she looks great , you're great .
everything's calm .
calm and great .
yes , all of us .
why don't you just put some valium in her soup?
don't test me tonight , hadley , i mean it .

we'll hang ... or talk about you and denny .
i mean , this is silly ,
you guys should be talking .
it's silly , huh?
so you wanna tell me how to live my life?
is that it?
oh , god .
shep , you know , you were doing better when you just wanted to screw me .

you wanted to ... you wanted to screw her .

i wa ...
i was talking about something very innocent .
right out of " gunsmoke .
this is the problem with being a deviant , everyone sees you as so one dimensional .
don't ... no , don't do your rap on me .
i know you .
you were hitting on her .
i wasn't hitting on her , den .
you're over reacting .
yeah , you were and i'll tell you something else .
the whole andy thing?
that was wrong .
it should have never happened .
you had no business being with her daughter .
i should've said something .
l ...
go , art .
i don't know why i didn't .
terry's right to despise you .
she's right to despise me?
what are you , a victim of stockholm syndrome?
come on .
this is me .
don't do this .
i knocked off a great piece of ass ...
what the fuck are you doing? !
shep , stop it !
just stop it .
okay , arthur , do your list ... and your promo and the give away go right into the give away .
you know what , denny?

she went from being a production assistant to a producer in record time , so you do the math .
i'll talk baseball .
i will ... but i don't want you producing my show anymore , shep .
i'm done with you .
i mean , i'll say what they want , but you're off of my show .
now you want to tell them or should i?
sorry , arthur .

jesus !
oh , you scared the hell out of me .
oh !
you have no boundaries .

what are you doing?

what do you think?
i didn't just come over to see you naked .
you know , been there , done that .
gonna be late , ladies !
let's move !
thanks for going to this .
oh , i know it means a lot to you .
mom , did you call him?
did you ever call him?
no , i didn't .
and you know ... you know , i don't need to .
the doctor says you're improving .
you're not wiggin 'out about this , are you?
stressing out?
jeez .
terry?
i don't mean to be the girl here , but we're gonna be late .
people don't know how to love .
they bite rather than kiss , and they slap rather than stroke .
maybe it's because they realize how easy it is for love to go bad , to become suddenly impossible ... unworkable , an exercise in futility .
so they avoid it and seek solace in angst and fear and aggression , which are always there and readily available .
or maybe sometimes ... they just don't have all the facts .
in here?
holy mother of shit .
what is it?
what is it?
what is it?
you'd better go back , okay?
just ...
i'll be right there .
look ... no , no .
no , what is it?
we pulled this jacket up , found a wallet .
go back , terry .
look , i mean it , honey .
i mean it .
go back , go back no , i don't wanna go back .
terry , please .
give me the flashlight .
baby , no .
no .
give it to me .
give it to me .
give me the flashlight , denny .
give it to me !
it's an old water well .
all covered up .
he must have ... come out to walk the property and fallen through .
you guys sh should go call the police .
oh my god .
oh god .
... to honor ... ... our sense of loss .
what is the price we've paid?
what is the price we've paid for ...
anger and resentment can stop you in your tracks .
that's what i know now .
it needs nothing to burn but the air and the life that it swallows and smothers .
what?
what?
okay .
whoa !
it's real , though ... the fury , even when it isn't .
it can change you ... turn you ... mold you and shape you into someone you're not .
the only upside to anger , then ... is the person you become ...
good job .
... hopefully someone that wakes up one day and realizes they're not afraid of its journey , someone that knows that the truth is , at best , a partially told story .
that anger , like growth , comes in spurts and fits and in its wake ,
leaves a new chance at acceptance and the promise of calm .
then again , what do i know?
i'm only a child .
