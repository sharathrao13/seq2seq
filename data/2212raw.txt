you never wanted to talk about it .
do you love me , sam?
well , what do you think?
why don't you ever say it?
what do you mean?
i say it all the time .

people say i love you all the time , and it doesn't mean anything .
you know , sometimes you need to hear it .
i need to hear it .

aah !
god help me .
oh , god ... help me .
i am sunk in the abysmal swamp where there is no foothold .
i have reached the watery depths .
the flood overwhelms me .
i am wearied with calling .
as we say farewell to our friend sam wheat , we are reminded of his kindness ... his generosity , his buoyancy of spirit .
all that we treasure ... our loved ones , our friends , our body , our mind ... are but on loan to us .
we must surrender them all .
we are all travelers on the same road , which leads to the same end .
as our loved one enters eternal life ,
let us remember that love , too , is eternal .
that although we will miss him , our love will light the void and dispel the darkness .
i picked up your shirts today .
i don't know why .
mr. reynolds told me to tell you hello .
i broke into tears .
it's like i think about you every minute .

hey , molly , i know about the green underwear that you wrote your name on .
i'd never get over that , i tell you that .
i know about the picture in reno .

it's molly .
molly?
i'm oda mae brown .
i don't know you or sam , but let me tell you what he did .
he kept me up all night singing i'm henry the eighth , i am .
that's how he got me to go out with him .
look , i'm sorry .
i just ...
i just don't believe in this life after death stuff .
well , tell her she's wrong .
he says you're wrong .
you're talking to him right now?
he just asked me to tell you that you're wrong .
so where is he?
i can't see him .
i can only hear him .
i'm right here .
that doesn't help , sam .
i'm holding her hand .
he says he's holding your hand .
what are you doing?
what do you think you're doing to me?
if you think i'm here for my health , you're crazy .
sam's dead , ok?
he's dead .
tell her i love her .
he says he loves you .
sam would never say that .
say ditto .
what the hell is ditto?
ditto !
to tell you the truth ,
i don't know how i'm doing this .
confidentially , nothing like this has ever happened to me before .
i mean , nothing .
now i can't turn it off .
is this him?
is this you?
yeah .
yeah .
huh .
cute .
white , but cute .
what i don't understand is , why did he come back?
i don't know .
why is he still here?
he's stuck , that's what it is .
he's in between worlds .
you know , it happens sometimes that the spirit gets yanked out so quick that the essence still feels it has work to do .
would you stop rambling?
i'm just answering her question .
he's got an attitude now .
i don't have an attitude .
yes , you do have an attitude .
we're having a little discussion .
if you didn't have a attitude , you wouldn't have raised your voice .
god damn it , oda mae ...
don't you god damn me .
don't you take the lord's name in vain .
would you relax?
you relax .
you're the dead guy .
want me to help?
you apologize .
jesus christ !
i'm leaving .
nobody talks to me like that , you understand?
now , you better apologize .
i'm sorry .
i apologize .
ok?
now , would you sit down?
please?
he's apologized .
i need you to tell molly what i'm saying , but you have to tell her word for word .
yes .
he wants me to tell you what he's saying word for word .
molly , you're in danger .
you can't just blurt it out like that .
and quit moving around , will you?
you're making me dizzy .
i'll just tell her in my own way .
molly , you in danger , girl .
what are you talking about?
i know the man who killed me .
he knows who killed him .
his name's willy lopez .
i know where he lives .
he's a puerto rican , willy lopez .
he knows where he lives .
write it down .
you write it down .
i ain't no damn secretary .
just do it !
argh !
he's so testy .
what is it you want me to write?
it's 303 prospect place , apartment 4 d.
303 prospect place?
yeah .
that's my neighborhood .
molly , he's got my wallet , he's got my key , and he was in here .
he's got his wallet and key and was here .
yesterday after your walk with carl , you talked to floyd , took off your clothes ...
all right , all right .
when you came in after your walk with carl , he saw everything .
go to the police .
it was a setup .
i was murdered .
he says go to the police .
he was murdered .
there's somebody else involved ...
i don't want no more to do with this .
where are you going?
i'm leaving , i did everything i said i'd do .
and don't be following me .
i'm finished .
i mean it .
have a nice life .
have a nice death .
goodbye .
molly , there is no one on earth besides you who wants this to be true more than me , but you got to be rational about this .
sam is no more in this room than ...
look , i understand the need to hang on to him ,
i really do , but this is absurd .
i know this seems absurd , but it had to be real .
you believed some fortune teller from brooklyn who shows up at your door?
i watched her have a conversation with him .
i don't buy it , moll , not for a minute .
what about the things she knew?
what things?
the photo sam took of me on our trip to reno .
carl , we were alone .
and the green underwear that i wrote my name in .
she said sam knew who killed him .
yeah , that he was set up .
this is getting deranged .
we're off the deep end .
she had a name and an address ...
willy lopez .
303 prospect place , apartment 4 d.
this is sick .
oh , carl .
this is really sick .
oh , god .
molly , i don't understand how you could ... you could ... swallow this crap .
i mean ... this guy may not even exist .
maybe she's just trying to use you to set someone up .
you're right .
you're absolutely right .
that's what i got to find out .
what do you mean , find out?
she said sam wants me to go to the police .
sam wants you to go to the police?
jesus , moll .
are you out of your mind?
what are you going to tell the police?
that some storefront psychic has been communing with the dead?
do you know what that sounds like?
you're talking ghosts here , for christ's sake .
i'm sorry .
this stuff just really gets to me , you know?
it's ok if you don't believe me .
i'm trying to , molly .
look ... if it'll make you feel any better ,
i'll go check this out , ok?
i want you to try and get some sleep .
ok?
all right .
i'll call you in the morning .
ok .
be careful .
carl .
what the hell are you doing here?
who you been talking to , willy?
talking to "?
what the hell do you mean?
some woman knows all about you , everything .
where's she getting it from?
i haven't said a word to anybody .
she knows your name and where you live .
a lot of women know where i live .
this is not a joke .
she knows about the murder .
i want you to find this bitch , whoever she is , and i want you to ...
just get rid of her , ok?
i've got $4 million stuck in a god damn computer .
if i don't get those codes , if that money is not transferred soon ...
i'm ... dead .
we're both dead .
why not tell them you only launder money the first of the month?
what the hell is wrong with you?
is everything a joke?
you killed a man .
you were supposed to steal his wallet .
was that a joke?
i did you a favor .
that was a freebie .
look , these are drug dealers , ok?
just don't blow this for me .
i've risked my job .
i could go to jail . $80, 000 of that money is mine .
look , just ...
let me have the key to sam's apartment .
i'll get the address book myself , ok?
you god damn bastard !
why?
why?
you were my friend !
i had a life , god damn you .
i had a life !
look , i don't even believe in this stuff myself .
but she was real .
you think i'd come down here if it wasn't real?
you know , you told me if i had any new information that i should come .
so here i am .
i know how this sounds .
i hear myself saying it , and i want to cringe .
but this woman knew things she couldn't have known .
things sam only said to me .
ok , according to this psychic lady , there are ghosts and spirits all over the place watching us all the time?
huh?
hell , i'm never going to get undressed again .
excuse me .
i got more important things to do .
the guy's name is willy lopez .
all i'm asking you to do is check it out .
ok .
wait here .
let me see if the guy's got a record , all right?
great .
what are you doing?
where's the file on willy lopez?
there isn't one .
he was probably some old boyfriend she was trying to get even with .
this psychic woman's got a record that goes back a long way .
1967 ,
shreveport , forgery ... selling false i. d.
served one year , 1971 .
baton rouge , arrested for fraud .
numbers racketeering , served 10 months , 1974 .
look , this is impossible .
it goes on and on .
she knew things , private things .
now , how could she have known all that?
a lot of times they read the obits .
she just had to see the word " banker " ... boom .
hell , they even go through your ... garbage to find things they can use ...
letters , old papers .
it doesn't take much .
no .
it was real .
she knew about a ... a sweater i knitted .
and songs we sang .
our trip to montego bay .
i'm sorry .
i know this is hard .
people want so much to believe .
they're grieving , they're vulnerable ... and they will give anything for one last moment .
believe me .
these people know what they're doing .
i know how you must feel , but you know you can press charges .
no .
thank you .
oh , god , let this be it .
yes .
hello .
eddie?
it's carl bruner .
what's up?
everything's fine .
just , we're all set .
let me know what you want me to do .
want you to transfer the money from the 12 separate accounts into a single account under the name rita miller .
ok .
tomorrow at five minutes before closing , 3 : 55 p . m . , transfer the full account to the first island bank of nassau , registry number 486 9580 .
call us when it's done .
ok .
i've got it .
just tell mr. balistrari that there won't be any more problems , ok?
yeah .
i'll do that .
thank you .
good work , carl .
molly , why can't you hear me?
i need you .
who is it?
it's carl , molly .
no .
don't open it , molly .
he's a murderer .
hi .
hey .
i know it's late .
i'm sorry to disturb you .
i've been thinking about you all day , and i feel really lousy about what happened last night .
this supernatural thing just ...
don't worry about it .
it's ok .
no , it's not .
you needed me to hear you , and i didn't .
i wasn't there for you , and that was ... that was wrong .
it's just , i ...
i just ...
i want you to know that i'm your friend .
thanks , carl .
you were never our friend .
that really means a lot to me .
me , too .
i brought you some japanese apple pears .
i know you like them .
thanks .
that's very sweet .
could i come in for a second?
it's just been one of those days .
maybe some coffee?
yeah .
come on in .
no , molly .
you seem a little tense .
are you ok?
no .
i'm fine .
it's just ...
what can i tell you?
it's been tough .
it just still hurts so much .
you lying snake .
and on top of it , it's stuff at work .
they've given me my own accounts , which is good , but i just haven't really had time to adjust , kind of absorb everything .
it's no big deal .
yeah .
can i have just a little more cream?
yeah .
oh , shit .
jesus .
i can't believe i did that .
are you all right?
yeah , i'm fine .
oh , god .
let me throw that in the washer .
don't worry about it .
it's ok .
it's just ...
you want another shirt?
no .
it'll dry .
it'll just take a minute .
there you go .
where were you today?
i thought you were going to come into the bank and sign those papers?
i was supposed to , but i didn't have time .
i went to the police .
you did?
wow .
what did you tell them?
what did they say?
it was awful .
i felt really stupid .
they brought out a file on this woman and ...
at least 10 inches thick .
a ripoff artist , huh?
no , molly .
you know , the sad thing ... is that i believed her .
molly ... sometimes we need to believe .
why?
what's the point?
molly , it's not easy to face the realities of life sometimes .
you got to give yourself that .
what you've got to remember is the love that you guys felt .
you got to remember how good sam was .
you were everything to him , molly .
you were his life .
i feel so alone .
you're not alone .
ok?
you got your work .
you're incredibly talented .
you're young .
you're fantastically gorgeous .
i don't know what's real anymore .
i don't know what to think .
just think about sam .
think about the time you guys had together .
how wonderful that was .
yeah .
let your feelings out , moll .
it's ok .
life turns on a dime .
you know?
i mean ... people think that ... they're there forever , that there's always going to be tomorrow , but that's bullshit .
sam taught us that .
you have to live for now .
for today .
i can't .
i'm sorry .
it's ok .
l ...
i ...
i can't .
it's just too soon .
it's ok .
you've been great , carl .
but i need you to leave .
i understand totally .
please .

what the hell are you doing?
what am i doing?
you're trying to move it with your finger .
you can't push it .
you're dead .
it's all in your mind .
the problem with you is you still think you're real .
you think you're wearing those clothes?
you think you're crouched on that floor?
bullshit !
you ain't got a body no more , son !
it's all up here !
you want to move something , you got to move it with your mind !
you got to focus !
how?
how do you focus?
i don't know how you focus .
you just focus .
how did you do that?
you got to take all your emotions , all your anger , all your love , all your hate , and push it way down into the pit of your stomach and let it explode like a reactor .
pow !
ok .
ok .
don't laugh .
way to go , kid .
i did it .
i did it .
way to go .
from your gut , like i told you .
give it time .
what else have you got?
how long have you been here?
since they pushed me .
someone pushed you?
yeah , someone pushed me .

you don't believe me?
you think i fell?
you think i jumped?
well , fuck you !
it wasn't my time !
i wasn't supposed to go !
i'm not supposed to be here !
oh .
