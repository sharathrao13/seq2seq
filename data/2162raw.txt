i don't see him .
the guy's harmless .
well , who is he?
he didn't see anything happen .
did you get his name?
never mind his name .
what about the garbage bags?
why does he come out at night?
maybe he collects food for the shelters .

did you talk to him?
marvin .

cancer .
i'm so sorry to hear that .
what about desmond?
your friend , right?
listen , i don't know what to do , considering .
considering what?
marvin's past .
that's where we first met .
the precinct .
i took your statement the last time marvin witnessed a crime .
oh , right .
i'm surprised you remembered .
that must be three years ago .
you didn't even talk
easy , marvin .
maybe you need to spend a little less time peeping .
okay , look , we both saw desmond get killed .
rosy !
please .
no , no , no .
she seems certain .
are you?
and what about you?
what did you see?
it looked like something happened .
it looked like something happened?
are you 1 00 % sure , marvin?
you saw a murder?
i don't know .
it doesn't sound like trouble to me , but ...
i can check in on you from time to time .
could you do that ...
detective?
yeah .
sure .
i can put some of my guys on patrol .
keep an eye on the 'hood .
and ... call me gary .
no , no , no , it's not a problem .
no?
no , are you kidding?
oh , stop .
rosy , hey .
hey , fink .
hey , carmen .
hi .

rosy was telling me about this garbage guy .
i've seen him around .

his face?
i don't know .
it's a face .
i never really noticed .
are those the cops dumars put downstairs?
yeah . ls he still on the couch with mom?
yep .
are you okay?
oh , um ...
i haven't smoked in two days .
you're a good influence on me .

you're alone .
yeah , rosy's arguing with your mom and dumars .
guess what .
what?
i've given up everything .
no cigarettes .
no perfume .
i'm clean , harmless .
you could eat off me .
god , what a corncob .
what's dumars doing now?
trying to pork mom , accusing me of being a junkie .
i want to smash him .
how's garbage?
he doesn't leave his apartment anymore .
just watches .
sounds familiar .
des has been gone long enough to be a missing person .
did you ask officer dumars?
whatever .
he's got other things on his mind .
hey , can i look?
sure .
are you okay?
are you taking anything?
i haven't had anything since des has been gone .
it's part of the problem .
there's mrs. leibowitz .
ma bell?
yeah , she's been down there for a while .
i think she's looking for desmond .
like rosy?
lost a fix .
fuck off , carmen .
or get on with fucking my brother so i can stop chaperoning you over here .
rosy ...
i'm sorry .
it's just ...
i don't know what we saw , but it looked bad .
and garbageman ...
i gotta do something .
you know , my dad's the building manager .
bad idea .
what idea?
it would be the easiest thing to get a key to garbageman's apartment .
terrible , terrible idea .
and marvin could keep watch for us .
here's my mobile number .
haven't you guys seen this movie?
fucking terrible idea .
what do you think?
the pastures .
hmm?
adam pasture .
the kid who disappeared last week .
his family would have reported him missing .
we could talk to them .
see what they know .
and it might help get dumars to take us serious ly .
come on , it's not gonna hurt .
803 .
this should be the pastures .
# why must all the boys act so shy? #
# l have guessed the reason why #
# l may be as brown as a berry #
# but that's only secondary #
# and you can't tell the difference after dark #
# mmm , i may not be so appealing #
# but i've got that certain feeling #
# and you can't tell the difference after dark #
# they say that gentlemen prefer the blond hair #
# ladies , tell me , am i out of style #
# just because l'm slightly shady? #
# wait until i've won you #
# and my love drops down upon you #
# you can't tell the difference after dark #
# oh , go be yourself , now #
# beat it on out there , boys #

there's no answer .
i can't see through the curtains .

maybe neither of them are him .
you need to get out of there .
now , just a sec .
rosy found feathers .
they're gray , like pigeons or something .
i don't think it's him .
oh , i just figured out what was glowing .
it's his fridge .
it's padlocked .
carmen , get rosy .
get out of there .
she's trying to find a light switch .
carmen , can you hear me?

so what exactly is your beef?
i just don't know what you're doing .
well ... [ sighs ]
well , your mom ...
she's a special lady .
and she really digs me .
and i think that what we've got could really blossom .
i don't want to know what you do with my mom , just so long as you never pretend to be my dad .
and stop pretending that you don't believe me and assigning these guys to the courtyard .
what?
who's the official looking guy in the car?
let me see .
and there's another one .
and another one .
those aren't my guys .
i might as well be a beat cop .
i don't even have " guys .
i'm ...
i'm sorry .
i was trying to impress your mom .
i don't even have the authority to put men on patrol .
well , then who are they?
well ... maybe i could find out .
hey , you're home .
what are you doing out here?
oh , trying not to smoke .
because of marvin?
that's so sweet .
shit , it's garbageman .
what the hell is this?
this was supposed to happen tomorrow .
i'm out of time .
it's now or never .
ls it stable?
lf you keep it cold .
i don't like it .

i'm very , very sorry .
it was a mistake .
oh .
a little mistake .
i'm very sorry .
excuse me , sir?
sir?
just a moment .
the phone .
where's the fucking phone?
marvin?
where are you?
following garbageman .
we need your eyes .
we need help .
close it .

9 1 1 emergency .
the judas breed .
i've seen two of them .
could you repeat that , sir?
two people are dead .
a cop is dead .
my sister's been ... killed .
come on .
go .
give me the goddamn phone .
the judas egg .
smart boy .
that's a king egg .
that's a fertile male .
yeah .
i have an emergency .
forward this to the cdc , a. d. kirschner .
lmmediately .
authorization 1 9 7 66 7 .
we've got two specimens .
they're soldier caste .
probably more .
what's the matter?
i'm allergic to roaches .
right .
then you'll be my coal miner's canary .
put that in the fridge .
nobody does anything stupid , and nobody has to die early .
we have to destroy it .
now , that qualifies as stupid .
a fertile male could establish a new colony .
a new outbreak .
deck chairs on the " titanic .
that egg is one of thousands .
they're hoarding them .
waiting .
we have to destroy it .
we have to try to
hey , i will kill you .
so help me god , i'll kill you .
here .
that egg equals my getaway money .
as far from civilization as i can get .
we've already lost .
it's over .
empty that around the door .
it's kerosene .
they don't like fire .
that doesn't make any sense .
they don't have intelligence .
strategize , reason .
they adapt .
that's how we made them .
they don't have to be any bigger or stronger , so they got smarter .
this is not a city anymore .
it's a goddamn killing jar .
the door !
mom .
yeah?
why aren't you in your room?
run !
close the goddamn door !
oh , my god .
aah !
don't shoot .
it's us .
marvin ...
ls carmen alive?
he's trying to talk .
