hey , wait for baby .
come in .
butterfield 84597 .
where'll we put these , lady?
put that there .
and put that there .
yes , ma'am .
and put that here .
yes , sir .
now , don't be rude .
you'll get yours .
mrs. merrick , please .
is the baby all right?
yes , ma'am , he's asleep .
would you wait until the new nurse comes?
yes , ma'am .
don't forget to remember to drop in often .
it's always a pleasure , mr. charles .
here's another of those " call long island operator number 15 .
don't you think you ought to call?
certainly not .
she knows better than that .
i told her i was bringing the wife along this time .
why do i always take it for granted that you're kidding?
hello , darling .
we just got in a little while ago .
will you bring up a passkey for that connecting door?
yes , ma'am .
thank you .
we had a lovely trip .
nick was sober in kansas city .
that's a very bitter woman .
tonight?
we'd love to .
i haven't been to a night club in ...
hello?
i'm sorry , it's long island again and they insist on cutting in .
yes , i'll tell her .
go ahead , long island .
hello , nora?
this is col. macfay .
don't you ever pay any attention to your messages?
well , how are you?
how is the famous detective?
quit , has he?
i should have thought ... with all the publicity he got over the last two cases .
i see .
listen , young lady , i've sent my car in for you .
the weekend?
i don't think ...
we just got off a train .
and there's the baby , you know .
i'm afraid ...
it's a trap .
he just wants to get me there to go over that yearly statement .
it isn't about business , is it , col. macfay?
i told you .
can't it wait till you come to town?
no , i'm not coming to town .
i'm just staying close to the house for a while .
you've got to come to me this time .
well , that's not much to ask .
very well , we'll come .
after all , we've never been down there .
it'll be nice in the country .
a quiet weekend .
good air for the baby .
i think they have a pool .
i'll see a lot of that pool .
i'll be up to my ears ... in financial statements , business , forecasts .
you have to do it sometime .
he can't do anything without you .
mommy , you shouldn't try to figure out a highly technical problem like that .
you'll strain yourself .
you see?
seems like man's work is never done .
come in .
beg your pardon , ma'am .
i'm col. macfay's chauffeur .
yes .
i thought i might help with your luggage .
as you wish .
come in .
i'm from miss sherwood's agency .
yes .
miss ...
dorothy waters .
these are my references .
miss sherwood spoke to you about salary?
yes , mrs. charles .
if you'll excuse me for saying so , mrs. charles ... it takes nearly two hours to get out to col. macfay's .
it does?
it's getting rather late .
we ought to hurry .
yes .
we have to go to long island , so i'll phone the agency later .
no , indeed .
the baby's awake now , mrs. charles .
i don't wonder ...
oh , dear .
come in .
are you the party that wanted the passkey?
party?
i'm more like a riot .
the bedroom , the connecting door .
sorry , ma'am .
we'll have to hurry .
shall i take the baby?
or shall i?
boy , this is going to be a cinch .
heaven help honest folk in a hotel like this .
nick .
well , i'm a monkey's uncle .
i didn't know this was your apartment .
hiya , creeps .
i'm glad to see you , nick .
yeah?
even if it did cost me one of the prettiest jobs i ever lined up for myself .
i've been trying to get my hands on those keys for two weeks .
well , that's that .
how've you been?
nickie , we must hurry .
how are you , mrs. charles?
i didn't recognize you .
how are you?
i'm fine .
mommy , this is creeps binder .
remember?
creeps?
creeps .
you remember .
nick sent me up the river .
it's nice you don't feel bad about it .
why should i?
it took a genius to outsmart me .
you wanna touch me?
you shouldn't run him down like that .
no , mrs. charles .
nickie's doing something .
well , i guess i won't need this anymore .
do you mind?
no .
make yourself at home .
what's the matter?
what have you got?
asta's bone .
you shouldn't leave it around .
you're older , you ought to know better .
a baby .
yeah .
is it yours?
yes .
what do you know .
is it a boy?
certainly .
what is it there?
say hello to mr. binder .
can he talk?
a few words .
i ought to rate one of them .
how about it?
come on , see .
what's the matter?
i was just trying to think who he looks like .
anyone i know?
i got it .
it's the missus .
why didn't you tell me you had a kid?
well , you know .
you don't have to feel that way about him .
he's all right .
you should see some of the monkeys i've seen .
and the fathers are taking bows .
feel better now , mommy?
how old is he?
he'll be a year next monday .
monday?
we'll throw him a party .
i'll get the mob to bring their kids .
what do you say?
we have to go to the country .
yes .
we don't quite know how long .
it's a date then .
i'll get my brother to let me bring his kids over .
he's got two of the cutest little tricks .
that's very kind .
leave it to creepsie , mrs. charles .
i'll throw you a baby party you've never seen the like of .
your father has such lovely friends .
that's all right .
think nothing of it .
glad to do it .
how much further is it?
the house is a little way up the hill .
it's about a mile around to the gates .
stop the car .
we'd better not , mr. charles .
stop the car , i tell you .
all right , you take it .
what happened?
you wouldn't believe me if i told you .
come back here , asta .
what are you hunting for?
i thought i knew , but now i'll take anything i can find .
what is it?
not a thing .
i wish you'd tell me what it's all about .
what happened to the chauffeur?
he was scared .
now i am .
scared of what?
i don't see anything .
there isn't anything .
that's what i'm scared of .
let's go back to new york .
we can't .
col. macfay's expecting us .
let's go someplace and get a drink and think it over .
the nearest drink is macfay's .
mommy , you're a stubborn woman .
would you mind opening the gates?
what do you want?
we're bringing back col. macfay's car .
i see that all right , but how do i know what you want?
this is the charles family .
nick charles and family .
anyone can say that .
and suppose you say it to col. macfay .
there's a party down here , he says his name is charles .
he looks to me like a pool parlor dude .
okay , if you say so .
all right , go ahead .
thank you .
hey , there .
just a minute .
it's all right .
we've been announced .
those are my feet .
what's the idea of the kid?
we have a dog and he was lonesome .
that was the idea , wasn't it , mommy?
what is all this about?
you'll find out .
i'll go with you to see that you arrive safe .
come in .
make yourself useful for once and bring in the bags .
i'm mrs. bellam , the housekeeper .
we're sorry , we're late , but we lost your chauffeur .
bless your heart .
that's quite all right .
think no more about it .
come this way .
but all these guards and everything .
is the colonel all right?
bless you , yes .
he's waiting dinner .
you needn't hurry .
if you'll just follow me .
i won't have it .
i'm not a child .
i won't put up with it .
what's the use of saying we won't , when we are?
it's a lot of april foolery .
you call it what you like .
i've seen what i've seen .
it was the cuban .
i don't think you need to worry anymore .
the two men had a falling out .
one of them killed the other .
the other?
i'm the one that doesn't want to be killed .
father dear , freddie means that he ...
jesse , down .
at last .
how are you , colonel?
how are you , my dear?
glad to see you .
wasn't there a body in the road?
he don't believe me .
oh , yes .
you see?
a body?
yes .
it was gone when i went back .
just a trick .
it's all part of their game , their plan to terrify me .
go on .
everybody brings these wild stories to me , but nobody tries to help .
what is it , colonel?
nothing wrong with nora's estate?
estate?
is that all you're worried about?
doesn't anybody care about me?
father , why don't you have dinner first?
then you can tell them all about it afterwards .
none of us has even met mr. and mrs. charles yet .
my adopted daughter , lois .
it seems awful we've never met before .
yes , doesn't it?
and i'd like you to meet my ...
mr. dudley horn .
how do you do?
this is mr. coleman , father's secretary .
how do you do?
how do you do , sir?
jesse , down !
down , jesse !
charmed , i'm sure .
take this dog out where it belongs .
where are your manners?
come on .
thorough nuisance .
it wasn't his fault .
nick smells like a dog .
i mean , he smells like asta .
now , are you ready for dinner?
yes , i would like a ...
that's all right .
never mind about washing .
freddie , lock up that liquor cabinet .
but maybe they would like a ...
mrs. charles doesn't drink and i want mr. charles to have a clear mind .
where are the others?
i never knew such a lot .
as if i've not got enough to worry me over .
here you are , sir .
tell them to serve dinner .
i want to have a talk with you .
i want to get you working on this .
nora's estate .
this is business , nora's business , your business .
what'll happen to the estate if something happened to me?
nothing's going to happen to you .
everything's going to be all right .
you go on in .
i'll send the baby upstairs .
i'll take care of nick .
don't be long .
put the lights out .
no use wasting money .
getting me on another case?
that penny pincher can afford the best detective there is .
he's trying to get one for nothing .
you're abetting him .
i don't know what you're talking about .
then what was all that business at the door?
i was just picking his pocket .
i haven't been married to you for nothing .
mommy .
suppose you had someone working for you ... and he did something they put him in jail for?
he did it .
you didn't do it .
you even try to get his sentence cut down .
but you couldn't .
when he gets out , he comes and says it's your fault .
your fault?
he wants a lot of money .
when you won't give it to him , he hopes you won't be pigheaded .
because he dreamed twice about your dying .
the third time he dreams things , they come true .
what do you think?
i wouldn't hurry up my dying on his account .
was this the man playing dead beside the road?
no , it's his servant .
the two of them have terrorized this place .
have you reported them to the police?
i'm not altogether a fool .
of course , i have .
they can't arrest a man just because he told you his dreams .
he tells me he's dreaming about me dying .
i know church well enough to know that's a threat .
church?
phil church , an engineer .
worked for me 10 years ago .
and he's been in jail ever since?
yes .
yes .
he got out a month ago .
been living down the road for 10 days .
you think he really means to kill you?
no .
i don't think he means to kill me .
i know it .
please , father .
he's only trying to get it straight in his mind .
there's nothing to get straight .
the man means to kill me , i'm asking mr. charles not to let him do it .
that's simple enough , isn't it?
even for mr. charles .
no .
col. macfay?
the swimming pool's on fire .
what?
nickie .
stay where you are !
one move out of you and i'll blow your head right off your neck .
kill him if he even bats an eye .
tom , take that gun out of mr. charles 'face and stop bellowing .
awfully glad to see you , mr. horn .
ain't the right guy .
what is it?
it's the dog .
jesse?
yep .
dead?
yes .
his throat's cut .
he was a swell dog .
this is gonna be tough on lois .
find anything?
only them .
they don't look like nothing , don't lead nowhere .
they're footprints , all right .
our man had rags wrapped around his feet .
you know a lot about them things , mister?
yes .
back home i'm a boy scout .
what's happened , dudley?
what is it?
it's jesse .
he's been killed .
no .
you'd better go back to the house .
why did they do an awful thing like that?
freddie , take her back .
is this the kind of thing that's been going on?
more or less .
some of it's silly , but it's nasty , too .
what do you think is behind these tricks?
what's he up to?
trying to scare the colonel into coming across with some money .
could any of the people on the inside be working with him?
i don't think so .
servants aren't much good but i imagine they're honest .
does macfay really owe him anything?
not the way we look at it .
you see ... his job was to get results ... without bothering the colonel with too many details .
we were trying to put over ...
well , call it a public utilities enterprise ... and some details were pretty illegal , were traced as far church .
but not as far as the colonel .
right .
in other words , if everything goes okay , he gets the profits .
lf not , church goes to jail .
that's about it .
and that's your job with the colonel now?
something like that .
how could they do a horrible thing like that?
i've had him ever since he was puppy .
how do they get in here?
that's what i want to know .
how do they get in?
well?
i'm afraid the bathhouse is badly damaged .
i don't care about bathhouses or dogs .
what are you going to do to protect me?
if they can get in here to do this , they can do anything .
you've got to help me , charles .
have you tried talking to church?
yes , didn't do any good .
i used to work under him .
he thinks i had a hand in sending him up .
how about making a bargain with him?
after all , he did do 10 years in jail .
i won't pay him a penny .
he can burn the house down before i pay him a cent .
maybe he's right , father .
maybe it would be better if you ...
i thank you to keep out of it .
when i want your opinion , i'll ask for it .
don't you dare talk to her that way .
you should be thankful she cares whether you live or die .
you little ...
you can't bulldoze me any longer .
i don't care how much money you have .
that may interest dudley .
but it doesn't mean a thing to me .
look here , freddie .
i know you have a crush on lois but don't make any cracks like that .
dudley .
what's this?
what if i am in love with her?
that's nobody's business but my own .
if you cared , you wouldn't let him talk to her that way .
why , she's too good for you .
and for you , too .
and you needn't bother to fire me .
i'm going .
is this true?
has that whippersnapper been making up to you?
no , of course not .
he's never said anything that ...
and you , dudley .
you ought to be ashamed of yourself .
all right , desert me .
all of you .
go on , you , too .
why don't you go?
col. macfay , it's just the baby ...
take your precious baby and go .
but , understand , this is the end .
there's the mining company reports , the lumber company , and the railway .
there you are .
you take them on from now on .
you manage them .
i'm through .
how do you like your quiet weekend?
production of lumbers , seasonally adjusted .
good heavens , do you understand that?
sure .
that's ...
that's " the indirect ratio between the sales depreciation ...
and the unrealized inventory losses .
understand?
yes .
but " naturally ...
an allowance has to be made for the major cyclical downswing .
you get that , of course .
naturally .
do you?
of course , " you have to have a fair degree of accuracy ...
by reference to a straight line correlation formula .
don't you think you'd better go and see church?
mommy , i'm going .
hey , asta , come here .
that's not that kind of a cat .
what are you sticking your pretty nose in here for , chum?
sorry , the door was open .
all right , you made your joke .
now , pull your freight .
get going .
just as you say , chief .
good evening , sir .
how do?
mr. church expecting you .
you're going to catch a cold , lying in damp roads on dark nights .
no , sir , i dress warm in this country .
i'm phil church .
how do you do?
sit down .
thank you .
this is smitty .
we can talk in front of her .
how do you do?
have a drink?
yes .
dum dum .
sit down .
go on with your packing , honey .
you bet .
going away?
yeah , back to cuba .
it'd be nice if you'd give us all the gory details first , though .
gory details?
yes .
you mean , the dead dog , and the burning bathhouse?
no , afterwards .
nothing happened afterwards .
but i dreamed ...
look , you're not tricking me , are you?
no .
you give me your word that nothing happened .
my word .
he's nuts .
if you listen to him , he'll have you nuts , too .
you can laugh if you want to .
but i don't laugh at my dreams .
listen ...
i came all the way back from cuba after the second one ... to try to make the colonel see reason , before it was too late .
because the third one's the end on my schedule .
this afternoon i had the third dream .
how does he usually die in these dreams?
he's all battered up .
his throat cut .
it's all kind of messy .
just the sort of death you'd expect that slob to have .
it'd be funny if it happened that way , wouldn't it?
no , it's funnier that it didn't .
hey , look .
are you sure he's all right?
how long ago did you leave him?
half an hour .
it must have happened after you left .
that's the end of him as a possible gold mine .
now , we got to think about you .
me?
yes .
why pick on me?
i can introduce you to a lot of rich people .
don't kid me , charles .
your father in law was macfay's partner back in the days when my foot slipped .
if my father in law had anything to do with this ...
i'll give you a check right now .
but i want proof .
there's always the catch in it .
proof .
nobody but me was putting anything on paper in those days , charles .
that's why nobody but me went over .
i knew you were going to be tough to deal with .
and i can't honestly say that i've ever dreamed about you ... or about your wife ... or about your baby ... yet .
stop it , dum dum !
men are such rowdies .
that's to remind you not to dream about my family .
call a cab .
we'll catch the 9 : 00 train .
still headed for cuba?
still cuba .
but i'll be back .
i think as time goes on ... you'll see your way clear to doing business with me .
you mean , continue to do business with you .
come along , asta .
he doesn't want to play anymore .
thanks for not shooting me .
that would've only made things worse .
there you are .
three for new york .
now , what'll you have?
yes , just this minute .
want me to stop them?
no , that's fine , thanks .
they've left .
thank heaven .
that's more like it .
i knew you'd scare him off .
i wouldn't be too sure it's over .
what do you mean?
my guess is whatever he meant to do in the first place , he still means to do .
if i were you , colonel , i'd move to new york .
i'm going to stay right here .
remember , though , that if you stay here , you're very apt to stay here .
nonsense .
the moment he knew you were here , he lit out .
that's all there is .
i hope you're right .
but his talk with me didn't sound like it .
he wants to include nora and me in this shakedown ... on the grounds that her father was your partner .
was he in on this mess?
because if he was , i want to settle with church .
sure , give him anything he wants .
a few thousands here and there .
what does it matter?
it all grows on trees .
that isn't answering my question .
run along , all of you .
run along .
good night , sir .
good night , father .
sleep well .
my father wasn't in this if there was anything wrong .
my father was just as honest as yours .
some day you'll find what a hot recommendation that is .
you knew nora's father , charles .
do you think he was a crook?
no .
do you think i'm a crook?
no .
for the sake of argument , can you pretend you think i am?
i can do that all right .
i thought you might .
nora's father knew more about lumber and mines ... than any man in this country .
but he didn't know the first word about finance .
i did .
so , if i'm a crook and nora's father's an honest man ... why should i give him a share of any crooked deal i put over?
i don't get it , but i know you've said something nice .
thank you .
come on , you big flatfoot .
good night , colonel .
good night .
and don't let me hear anymore about paying church .
i've slaved for that money of yours ... and i feel about it just as if it were my own .
his own?
you're suspicious of everything .
i'd hate to wake up some morning ... and find the fortune i'd married you for is gone .
stop talking that way .
of course , i can always earn a good living as a detective .
but what worries me is what are you and nickie going to live on?
you needn't wait up any longer , dorothy .
thank you , madam .
good night .
good night , sir .
she wouldn't be a bad looker if she took her specs off .
i'll speak to her .
don't get her hopes up .
nickie in there?
no , i'm keeping him in here tonight .
in here?
yes , i wanted to be sure he was safe .
where is he?
in the bureau drawer .
in the bureau?
well , that's fair enough .
he loves it , he went right to sleep .
i hope it doesn't get to be a habit .
it'll be a little inconvenient when he grows up .
hey , you didn't put my things underneath there?
no , they're in that chest .
i may be a little prejudiced , but i think he's all right .
asta , just a minute .
there you are .
my , it's stuffy in here .
open the windows , dum dum .
what time is it?
five minutes to 11 : 00 .
you've got to go right away , don't you?
i've got a few minutes .
i hate these schemes where all the pieces have to fit together .
too many things can go wrong .
we can't miss .
i wish you'd dream up some way to get that nick charles out of there .
i don't trust him .
he looks like a guy with insomnia to me .
i don't like him around , but i don't see how he can gum our game .
it was airtight without him , it'll be airtight with him .
don't let this goog bother you .
plenty of winners have had them .
hello , smitty .
busy?
no .
no , never too busy to see a friend .
come on in .
what do you know?
nothing much .
why , hello , church .
hiya , diamond back .
come on in , sit down .
i only got a minute .
a guy came in from up the river this morning ... with a line from your husband .
what is it?
what did tip say?
do you mind?
no .
well , what's tip up to now?
still kicking about wanting a larger cell?
he's been thinking again .
he sent down a lot of orders for material and stuff ...
with the warden's name forged on them .
let's see .
he wants you to make a deal with someone ... who can pass himself off as the warden's go between ...
and collect the rake off .
nothing can stop that boy .
he's a smart little guy .
too smart .
seven years i've been married to him and ... he's so slick he hasn't been out of the can to finish our honeymoon .
don't seem to be breaking your heart .
you spend a lot of time with this guy , church , don't you?
now don't start that again .
he's just a friend , like i told you .
any guy can get to be too good a friend , like i told you .
when's he going to cuba?
how did you know he was going?
i get around .
he's going tomorrow .
good .
hope nothing happens to upset his plans .
be seeing you .
some day i'm going to skin a knuckle on that four eyed gent .
you'd better catch him without the cheaters on .
he's plenty good as long as he can see .
yeah?
11 : 00 , time to go .
adis .
good luck .
wish me luck .
say , i thought this was strictly business .
you know , i could go for you .
don't give me that .
i've been fooled too many times .
you love me , don't you?
what if i do?
i'm only in this for the coin .
we'll have plenty of coin from now on , baby .
we?
you and me .
what do you say?
want to play for keeps?
okay .
maybe i ought to know a little more about the ins and outs of what you're doing .
what's the matter?
losing confidence in me since i stopped that punch?
i haven't got that much sense .
time for you to make that telephone call .
goodbye , honey .
i'll keep my fingers crossed for you .
hello , this is mrs. h. culverton smith .
i'd like to speak to ...
i would like to speak ...
you wanna play .
all right , if you promise to go back to sleep .
there .
you wanna play with him?
no , he's asleep .
all right , you can play with him , but promise not to wake him .
no , it's all right .
it won't come off .
pull it , you'll see .
work hard , honey .
maybe you can get it out .
it's all right , darling .
it's just the baby .
he's getting so big .
we're going to have to make up our minds who's going to tell him .
tell him what?
about life .
life .
who's life?
now , nickie , this is important .
this is your responsibility .
if he were a girl , that would be different , then i'd do it .
but you know more about boys than i do , so you ought to tell him .
all right .
where is he?
not now .
i mean , when he's about 14 .
here , you hold him .
how nice .
i heard you talking and wondered if anything was wrong .
we were playing with the baby .
i'm sorry we woke you .
no , you didn't .
i couldn't get to sleep anyway .

i don't want to disturb you .
nonsense , we're dying for company .
nick just has to put on his robe .
yes , dear .
please don't .
i mustn't stay .
you wanna go to sleep .
well , some of us do and some of us don't .
isn't he lovely?
in all the excitement , i hadn't even seen him .
he's a darling .
we sort of like him .
we might as well , we're stuck with him .
hello , sweetheart .
isn't it kind of late for you to be up?
he's still running on california time .
come on , give me a smile .
come on .
that sounded like a shot .
that was a shot .
just a minute .
please hurry .
father .
see if he's all right .
wait here with nora .
that's a mean way to die .
know any good ways?
i'd better tell lois .
i heard the noise .
macfay's been murdered .
well , we all have to go someday .
shall i call the sheriff?
yes .
calling all cars .
attention all cars .
phil church , age 37 , height 5'11 " ... weight 185 pounds , eyes brown ... hair dark , gray at the temples .
last seen wearing a light gray suit .
photograph every inch of that sill .
what have we got , doc?
bruise on left temple , blunt instrument .
throat cut with fairly large heavy blade .
death instantaneous .
right wrist broken .
been dead about half an hour .
that check with the time they found him?
check .
ought to be enough to go on .
i'll go into things more thoroughly tomorrow .
thanks , doc .
he says that cuban threw a big knife at him .
might be the same one .
it'll have the marks of his dog's teeth on the handle .
get the some of boys busy in the bushes to look for it .
yes , sir .
come on , jim .
he must've gone out the front door .
he?
who?
church , or the cuban .
how do you know?
i don't know .
i just seen the front door open when i went down the cellar .
what was you doing in the cellar?
i went down to fix the fuse .
what fuse?
the fuse that was blowed out .
how did you know it was blowed out?
i don't know nothing .
i was just doing what mrs. bellam told me .
and you were here reading?
yes .
ain't that late for a lady your age to be up?
i don't think so .
got things on your mind that worry you?
keep you awake?
no , i just don't sleep much .
you've been working for him a long time?
sixteen years .
and you knew this phil church when he worked for the old man?
yes , indeed , i knew him .
now , you just sit right down here and make yourself comfortable .
we're gonna have a nice , long talk about what you knew about him .
you weren't in bed and you're all dressed .
where were you?
i was sitting here , writing .
writing what?
a play .
go on , what kind of a play?
a mystery play .
so you write about murders?
do you ever think much about murders?
no .
and you say miss macfay and mrs. charles ... were the only ones in your room when it happened , right?
no .
then there was someone else?
yes .
who?
the baby .
yes , the baby .
but not the nurse?
no , the nurse was in her own room , asleep , i guess .
you'd better ask her .
her room is across from ours .
she ain't in there , she ain't anywhere in the house .
she's gone .
personally , i think she's very wise .
is that so?
this is a murder we're trying to clear up , lad .
so let's don't hang up on who tells what .
now , who gets the money?
according to his last will ...
miss macfay was to get everything but $100, 000 .
that went to mrs. bellam .
well , now , what do you figure all but $100, 000 would amount to?
certainly several millions .
you say you were asleep about an hour when you heard the shot .
i said half an hour .
stop wasting time here and start looking for him .
i got a lot of time to waste .
now , this church , you say you worked together .
are you and he still pretty close?
we were never close .
you didn't like each other much .
right .
are you unfriends enough so you'd like to see him in jail ...
or maybe the chair?
are you suggesting that i'd frame him?
now , don't get sore over a little thing like that .
wait till you hear what i'm really gonna suggest .
it seems to me that every time your husband gets in with a girl ... the insurance companies take an awful beating .
now , it's nice , very nice for a wife to trust her husband , but get this .
there's that wynant girl he knew before he was married .
he comes here to new york and there's a murder .
he goes back to the west coast , there's a good looking girl there ... and there's another murder .
he comes back here , meets this lois macfay ...
there's another murder .
listen , we're not dishing the dirt on your husband for the fun of it .
we're trying to show you what you're up against .
it ain't that a man that's had that many numbers ... could settle down to one .
was he really like that?
was he?
baby .
i always thought he was bragging .
he tell you about the coal man's widow in cleveland ... that wanted to set him up into the agency for himself?
was that jeanette?
no .
her name was bella spruce .
bella spruce?
and the lighthouse keeper's daughter in ...
the what?
the lighthouse keeper's daughter .
what was her name?
what it all comes down to is this lois .
you're wrong to think there couldn't be anything between them .
they're just making a monkey out of you .
covering up for them .
i'm sure you're right .
but what was the lighthouse keeper's daughter's name?
letty finhaden .
letty finhaden .
he wasn't in the room with you when it happened , was he?
i say , he made you give him that alibi , didn't he?
no .
mr. charles .
i'm van slack , the asst. district attorney .
oh , yes .
i thought perhaps ...
well , of course , everybody knows your reputation ...
but if you don't mind ...
not at all .
well , i'm a little confused .
the lamp torn away , a glass of water knocked over .
seems to have been quite a struggle .
but , nobody heard anything .
funny you didn't , mr. charles .
the way i figure it .
macfay was lying here reading the paper .
he puts it down ... he turns off the lamp .
the murderer comes in through the door ... or the window .
macfay hears him , he grabs for his gun .
it was his gun , wasn't it?
yes , he kept it on the table .
from the look of this hole ... where would you say the bullet was fired from?
i'd figure it come from about here .
then the murderer was already bearing down on his arm ... when macfay got the shot away .
or it could've gone off when it hit the floor ... after the arm was broken .
a paraffin test will show you whether he pulled the trigger .
yes .
the murderer knocked him back on the pillow with a blunt instrument .
then went after him with a knife .
anything to show that he came through the window?
no , not yet .
one of the servants said the front door was open .
yes , if you and the two other gentlemen ... came , as you said , when the shot was fired ... wouldn't you have seen or heard or ...
i didn't get here that quickly .
the lights went out .
an electrician can tell you what happened ... when the wires were cut from that lamp .
electrician .
yes .
did you people have a man watching church?
well , not exactly .
i suppose i should have .
the colonel was always yelling , imagining things ... which you know yourself is all pretty ridiculous .
could've been turned into a practical joke , couldn't it?
then you didn't have ...
you didn't have a heavy set man with thick glasses watching church?
no .
i thought not .
i'd never seen a country cop with a $6, 000 coup before .
so i took down his number , i'll get it .
did you get anything out of mrs. charles?
no , she's bats .
i wish my old lady was bats that way .
here , darling , please drink this .
no one will tell me anything .
i'd feel better if i knew whether father ...
did he die without ...
there was no pain .
he died instantly .
where was he shot?
he wasn't shot .
it was a knife .
a knife?
don't talk about it now , dear .
let's all get out of here as quickly as possible .
she can't stay here .
that suits me .
just as soon as we finish with the police .
did you have your session with them?
yes .
it was very interesting .
you think the police are going to be enough or ...
i should say they're more than enough .
you'd better take a bromide .
you're shaking like a leaf .
is there something you haven't told us?
yes , what is it , horn?
it's no wonder i'm jittery .
there's someone out to get lois .
how do you know?
i was warned over the phone ... just a little while ago , a man's voice .
he said , " call everybody off or lois will get what her old man got .
no .
we've got to call everyone off .
we've got to .
you can't call the police off once they're in .
the warning said call off everybody .
it must have been one of church's gang .
sure .
you think church murdered the colonel , don't you?
don't you?
of course .
your dog's outside , running with a knife in its mouth .
asta , quickly .
that will be asta .
we're gonna have to shoot it .
we'll never find him like this .
wait a minute .
he's not gonna run to strange men with lights .
what do you think he is , a moth?
call your men off , give me a flashlight .
give me that .
hey , boys , lay off .
give mr. charles a chance .
where did the dog find that knife?
we don't know .
he came around thataway .
where is he now?
he went thataway .
i'll go thisaway .
asta .
asta , come here .
give it to me .
give it that back .
charles .
what?
mr. charles .
yes , dear .
what is it?
what are you doing out here?
what's the matter?
it's ...
he has a gun .
he has a what?
look out !
why , it's horn .
well , can you beat that?
what were you shooting at him for?
i wasn't shooting at him , he was shooting at me .
why were you shooting at him?
well , everybody else was .
she's all right , she's alive .
it's just her arm .
carry her into the house .
what was she doing here?
she came to tell me that someone was after me .
she yelled and pushed me out of the way just as he started shooting .
you don't think she might have been trying to ...
you know?
what do you mean?
put me on the spot?
no .
if she hadn't pushed me , his first bullet would've caught me .
i almost heard it go past .
it was just a thought .
well , here's the knife .
that's the one that was used , all right .
could be the one that was tossed at me .
not much chance of fingerprints ... after the dog's been playing with it for nobody knows how long .
i'm apologizing .
take it in .
tell them to check it anyway .
funny that the dog should have got hold of it the second time .
yes , you may be right .
miss macfay , when did you first suspect horn of killing your father?
i didn't say that .
i didn't say he killed father .
your father objected to horn as your suitor , didn't he?
yes .
and if you'd married horn , he'd have cut you off without a dime?
i suppose he would have .
as soon as your father was dead ... you became extremely attractive financially .
don't .
please , don't .
please , mr. van slack .
she's been through too much already .
sorry , son .
what was the first reaction you saw on horn after the discovery of the murder?
why , nothing .
he just came to tell me that father had been killed .
yes , then what?
then he said to say that we were together when it happened ...
so the police wouldn't bother me .
he said that?
yes , he was only trying to protect me , and ...
he was trying to protect himself , child .
no , he couldn't have .
freddie .
take it easy , lois .
maybe father was right about dudley , and i wouldn't listen to him .
oh , poor father .
all right .
well , i guess that does it .
does what?
well , don't you get it?
no .
we know that horn and church are enemies .
when church starts to threaten macfay , horn sees a chance to frame him .
he kills macfay using the cuban's knife to do it .
if he wanted to frame church with the knife ... why should he try to kill me when i find it?
looks to me as if you've got two mysteries on your hands instead of one .
now you know why i retired .
good luck .
you're not walking out on me , are you?
i'm not walking out , i'm running out .
if there were any reasonable chance for me to help you , it'd be different .
but , during this quiet little weekend in the country ... my family's been threatened ...
i've had a knife thrown at me , i've been shot at , i've been suspected of murder .
from now , this is your case , you handle it .
i'm going back to new york and forget it .
come on , lois .
come on , mrs. bellam .
come on , freddie .
maybe i'm wrong .
come on , asta .
extra !
read all about it !
dream butcher hunted !
extra !
read all about it !
extra !
dream butcher hunted !
read all about it !
what is it?
what are they calling?
nothing .
have they found him?
not yet .
how do you feel?
sort of funny .
the doctor gave you something to make you sleep .
6 : 00?
have you been here all that time?
i didn't want you to be alone when you woke up .
you're so good to me .
why shouldn't i be good to my own flesh and blood?
forgive me .
i didn't mean ever to tell you .
it just slipped out .
i don't understand .
don't hate me .
please , don't hate me .
i couldn't bear it if you did .
i am your mother , but i don't ask anything .
only to be allowed to stay near you .
we heard you talking so we knew you were awake .
are you all right , lois?
why , yes .
what's the matter , lois?
you look upset .
it's nothing .
it's just that i'm so all at sea with father and dudley gone .
to go on , deciding things all alone ...
you won't be alone long .
wait till the news of your $5 million hits the front pages .
you'll find you've got relatives all over the world .
look , lois .
i haven't much to offer you , and i don't ask anything in return .
but whatever happens , or wherever you are ... you can always know i'm standing by .
freddie , dear , you're so sweet .
mr. charles .
mr. van slack's in your room , waiting for you .
thank you .
mommy , i'll see you later .
what do you mean , later?
i got rid of all those reporters .
what did you tell them?
i told them we were out of scotch .
what a gruesome thought .
hello .
hiya , charles .
i don't like to disturb you ... but the fact is we seem to work quite well together .
and i thought perhaps you might reconsider and come back on the case .
come back on the case?
i've never been out of it .
what's up?
the new york police found the woman who was with church .
i'm on my way up there now .
would you care to come along?
sure .
i'll get my hat .
i've been trying to trace that nurse , dorothy waters .
we have some fingerprints from the references she gave to mrs. charles .
they're checking them now .
how about that license number?
that car belongs to a man by the name of vogel .
a gambler racketeer .
i'll see him later .
that's for you .
hello .
speaking .
who is it?
never mind names .
just a friend of yours , telling you ... if you know what's best for you , to lay off that macfay case .
you understand?
let it alone .
if you don't , we'll ship that body of yours back in a box .
thank you , but we have an encyclopedia .
isn't that nickie crying?
that wasn't the baby .
he's sound asleep .
nickie !
go on and ring .
hello?
i've got to rush .
will you call back later?
what?
mr. charles is not here .
this is mrs. charles speaking .
mr. charles and i always work together .
i have an important information .
you come where i tell you .
but understand .
i am not a stool pigeon .
so do not bring any police .
i see .
what's the address?
i'll be there .
hello , lieutenant .
well , how are you , mr. charles?
things sure pop when you're in town .
they certainly do .
hello , mr. van slack .
hi , guild .
is this the smith woman's apartment?
but if your killing was at 1 : 00 last night then she's in the clear .
we had a plant here from before midnight till after 3 : 00 ...
and she was here all the time .
you sure?
positive .
i was here myself .
how did you happen to be watching her place?
well , it turned out to be a false alarm ... but she called me up on the telephone last night ... and said that there was someone hanging around , that ...
say , could she have been using me as an alibi?
why , she can't do that to me .
hello , nick .
well , nice to see you again , lieutenant .
pleased to meet you .
come on in , sit down .
i'll go get you a cup of coffee .
never mind .
so you picked on me to give you an alibi?
i got to lose a night's sleep so you can duck a murder rap?
so help me .
i never thought it was going to be murder .
what did you think?
i knew phil was trying to get dough ... out of macfay , but i never knew he meant to murder him .
you know it now , don't you?
i don't know anything that's got anything to do with murders .
murders?
how many other murders were planned besides macfay's?
i don't know anything about anybody's murders being planned .
you're psychic?
you get alibis for murders you don't even know are going to happen .
i'm never going to need an alibi for murder ...
'cause i'm never going to have anything to do with murders .
where's church?
i don't know .
he and dum dum left here about 11 : 00 last night .
i ain't heard of him since .
where were they going?
i don't know .
when are they coming back?
they're not coming back .
they said they were going to cuba .
whose coat is this?
phil's .
phil church's .
what's it doing here if he's not coming back?
it's been here two or three weeks .
how long have you known church?
since they sprung him .
didn't take you long to tie up with him .
we weren't playing for keeps .
i was only stooging for him .
there are a lot of rackets where it's handy to have a girl around .
blackmail rackets?
i mean , a lot of rackets except murder .
there's my bell .
sit down , i'll get it .
well , hello , diamond back .
come on in .
join the party .
we're just asking smitty a few questions .
about church?
i always figured he was a wrong guy .
what do you know about him?
me?
nothing , except that he's been spending a lot of time hanging around smitty .
you haven't been unloading to these people yet , have you?
only from here up .
you ever hear about talking through a lawyer?
we've got enough on her already to hold her as a material witness .
is this the man you saw watching church's house?
yes .
why , you big ape .
what's the answer?
her husband's a pal of mine .
he's been hanging on the wall upstate .
you know how those guys get to worrying .
i've been keeping an eye on her for him .
so that's what's been going on .
what do you think has been going on?
you don't think i been hanging around because i was nuts about you , do you?
i hear church is going away .
this cluck might think she's going with him .
suppose she had gone?
that's supposing too much .
there goes dum dum .
what have you done to phil church?
what have you done?
i don't know what you're talking about .
don't act like that .
you know what i mean .
you found out we were going away and you knocked him off .
you big lug .
lay off , you .
when i find those glasses , i'll kill you .
you dirty rat .
you'd beat your own mother , you would .
i'll beat the hide off you if i find those glasses .
lay off me , i haven't hurt church .
you got my word for it .
you'd lie about the weather , you double crossing , four eyed simp !
give me my glasses .
want to play policeman?
where are my glasses?
i knew there was copper in you , flatfooted stool pigeon .
give me my glasses and i'll get out .
i'll say you tried to dream him , that's what i'll do .
he'll dream you into the hudson , where all you'll do is poison the fishes ...
you mousy looking ...
let go there .
come on .
get in there , you .
all right , harry .

s , seor .
cigarette?
who gave you this?
the lady over there .
you'll excuse me?
an old friend , a very old friend .
thanks .
now , mommy , you know better than to come to a place like this ... your first day out of bed .
what if the health officers find out?
they'll put you back in quarantine .
i won't stay in quarantine .
i don't care who catches it .
well , i must be going .
good night .
good night .
i'll trade you two mumps for a measle , bella .
madam , how long have you been leading this double life?
just since we've been married .
how did you know i was here?
i saw a great group of men standing around a table .
i knew there was only one woman in the world who could attract men like that .
a woman with a lot of money .
bacardi .
two bacardis .
yes , sir .
the same .
yes , madam .
give me $14 . 75 . $14 ...
what for?
a man .
another one?
this is the man who phoned after you left .
he's somewhere right in this room .
he heard you were looking for dum dum .
now , dum dum owes him $14 . 75 and won't pay him .
he said that if i gave him the $14 . 75 , he'd tell me where dum dum was .
how are you going to contact this mysterious informer?
i told him i'd be holding the money in a handkerchief like this .
but , you didn't have any money until i showed up .
i was doing all right .
i'd have gotten it .
madame .
at last .
hello .
i knew you would come to me .
i've been watching you all evening ... with that thought in heart and in my eyes .
shall we dance?
yes , i think it would be better .
where is dum dum?
dum dum?
yes , i think i'd like to find him as soon as possible .
are you in love with him?
no .
then why should he spoil the beauty of this moment?
well , really .
i have a husband , you know .
a stupid american iceberg?
well , he's traveled abroad .
does he ever speak to you in burning words ... that make you go half mad with joy and yearning?
well , he's kind of cute .
cute?
incredible .
who's that?
stupid american iceberg .
hello , dum dum , how's tricks?
hiya , dum dum .
sit down .
make out all right with the police?
always i do .
how about church?
he making out all right?
that i do not know .
i come to ask you .
where do you think he is?
i don't know where he is .
your ear is getting into our drinks .
what's eating you?
i didn't mean it .
you never mean anything .
but that don't keep you from trying .
i do not know where mr. church is .
do you think he killed macfay?
does a man say he think his friend killed?
say , listen , i can tell you right now ... who kills most of the guys that get themselves killed in this town .
who are you looking at now?
is that little swine dum dum?
wait .
if you are not in love with him , why do you leave me?
look , here's your money .
let me go .

cute looking doll , i guess , under all that war paint , but plenty tough .

chestevere apartments .
chestevere .
don't tell me he's mixed up with her .
sure he is .
that boy must have a scooter .
just back from cuba and he ...
cuba?
i thought he said that ...
lf you call this cuba .
he's been hanging around these joints ever since he got out of stir .
say , you know more about this than the cops do .
and they're all wrong , if they think phil was mixed up in that thing on the island .
why , i saw him myself , going in about 11 : 00 ...
put those lights on !
remember me?
seora , are you all right?
yes , i'm all right .

i guess she ain't in , all right .

thank you , lieutenant .
it's a good thing you phoned me to trail you , ain't it?

you boys should stay off fire escapes when there isn't any fire .
you're coming to the station with us , ain't you , mr. charles?
no , i can't .
i have a lady waiting .
a lady?
no fooling?
surprised?
well , i always thought that you and the missus was the ideal couple .
yeah , but ...
you know how it is , lieutenant .
i know .
any idea who these mugs are?
no , i wouldn't know .
you'll find out , big shot .
there's plenty more of us .
dummy up , you !
all right , flynn , take them out .
just a minute .
would you mind taking the boys down ... the way they came up?
i don't want to alarm the lady .
sure thing .
all right , flynn .
out the window .
you know , there ain't nothing frightens off romance ...
like the touch of the law .
by the way , nick , any time you'd like to have me ... take mrs. charles out to a movie so you can get away for a while ...
would you do that?
sure .
i wouldn't mind it at all .
really , not at all .
well , you know me , pal .
sure , i know you , pal .
always kidding .
all in the spirit of fun .
yeah?
just kidding .
finished?
yes .
tell me , how long since you've seen miss mills?
a couple of weeks .
but i don't see my people unless they're behind in their rent .
what does she look like?
the way she wears make up , you'd think she's an old timer .
but she don't need to .
she's real pretty .
young?
yes , but don't fear .
she knows all the answers .
i wish i knew as much when i was her age .
i hope i haven't kept you from renting a room .
who , her?
i don't think she knows what she wants .
too bad .
i thought she was rather pretty .
well , stick around .
maybe you'll be able to work out something .
thanks but i'm married .
that don't mean a thing and you know it .
come in .
we were just talking about you .
yes?
this gentleman here was just saying you're the prettiest girl he'd ever seen .
and take it from me , he ought to know .
excuse me .
this is mr. charles .
miss ...
i didn't catch your name .
finhaden .
letty finhaden .
well , that's the fastest piece of work i ever saw in my life .
mr. nick charles , please .
good morning , mr. charles .
this is guild .
well , we've got something on that nurse .
we just found that her fingerprints match up with an agnes borup .
i know agnes well , and from that landlady's description of linda mills ... it just about fits her .
my guess is , if we get her , we get church .
no , i don't think so .
well , for one thing , a new love has come into church's life .
smitty may have stooged for him at first , but it's the real thing now .
they're planning on going away together .
come on up here .
i may have something for you .
yeah .
what?
what have you got?
tell us .
you find out something?
aren't you interested , mrs. bellam?
yes .
i haven't got it all worked out yet , but ...
freddie , maybe you could help me .
you're writing a mystery play .
oh , that .
how did you get your man?
i haven't gotten that far yet .
i'm stuck for a finish .
that's too bad .
there's still one or two pieces missing but i know this much .
everything that's happened has been part of a plan .
church ...
the baby party .
you said it .
come on , mug .
all right , boys .
all right now .
hit it .
hiya , nick !
how are you , nick?
glad to see you .

you know me , nick .

hey , this is the missus .
glad to meet you .
well , how are you?
she's okay for my money .
i wished i'd seen her first .
hey , wait a minute .
you can't come in here .
what do you mean i can't come in?
why?
you heard what he said .
you gotta have a kid .
i got a kid .
it's whacky .
hello , whacky .
hiya , nick .
glad to see you .
glad to see you .
i didn't know you were married .
married?
no one said you had to be married .
they just said you had to have a kid .
come on in and meet the missus .
you didn't snatch that , did you?
we don't wanna put the heat on this party .
no .
i got it legitimate .
i rented it for a buck .
okay .
we don't want no hot tot .
don't worry , he's as cold as a cucumber .
come on , kid , here .
whacky , this is mrs. charles .
hello , whacky .
it's mutual .
he's a pip , ain't he?
look at that sucker .
let's put them all in the pen .
the pen?
she means the kiddie pen .
i hope it's not a bad omen .
put them all in the pen , boys .
yes , nick .
put them in .
i'll get some ice cream .
no .
this is our party .
we got the stuff right here .
hamburgers , hot dogs and salami .
and there's root beer and coca cola .
didn't you bring nothing but root beer and coca cola?
you wanna make the kids sick?
i didn't know .
i had the kid out before .
nickie?
what?
will you order some ice cream?
yeah .
it'll be right up .
you're telling me .
room service , please .
there's a man outside , he wants to see you .
i put him in the study .
i thought mrs. bellam might be here .
i don't know where she is .
can i do something?
i just wanted someone to keep an eye on nickie .
let me .
that's very nice , but i ...
lois should get some sleep anyway .
well , thank you very much .
send it right up .
who is this man?
i don't know .
a big man with heavy glasses .
vogel .
vogel?
who's vogel?
he's one of the missing pieces .
get your hands up .
both of you .
this is mr. church , darling .
skip it .
i got no time to waste .
i told you i'd be seeing you , charles , but i didn't know it'd be this soon .
i've been dreaming again , charles .
only this time it's about you .
you ought to be psychoanalyzed .
twice i've seen you dead in my dreams .
both times you were all battered up , just like macfay was .
so if you don't want to be a widow , mrs. charles , get him on a train tonight .
i got a feeling i'm gonna have that third dream .
i'm packing right now .
okay .
now if you're smart you'll wait five minutes before you blow any whistles .
get him .
what?
don't mind me .
go on , get him .
well , why?
i never saw a man try so hard to get caught .
look at the clown climbing across that ledge in daylight .
why does he want to get caught?
just part of his plan .
where is he?
what happened , nick?
who do you want blasted?
a man's been killed .
you all better get out of here before the police come .
grab your kids and scram .
what happened?
get out of my way , will you?
freddie , will you get nickie?
of course i will .
shouldn't we notify the police?
they'll be here any minute .
where's nickie?
must be in the pen .
well , come on .
i got a feeling we better get out of here .
you want to see me?
it wasn't important .
just dropped in to see if there was anything new .
i'll wait till you're free .
i'm free now .
tomorrow will do .
tomorrow you may not be free .
you'd better wait .
stand aside .
what's going on here , casey?
phil church was shot , he fell in the alley .
we arrested these two .
they were the only ones around .
i had nothing to do with it .
found this in the trash can .
one shell empty .
it wasn't mine , i wouldn't have any reason to kill phil .
bring them along upstairs , boys .
come on .
hear from the doctor?
doctor says he was shot with a . 38 .
judging from the angle at which the bullet entered the body ... it could have come from most anywhere .
they're working on the gun now to see if it's the one .
what were you doing in the street down below?
mr. church told me he was coming here .
i tell her .
then i'm afraid she come over and butt in maybe , so i come to stop her .
stop her?
from what?
i don't know what she might do .
she get excited on phone .
what are you trying to do , frame me?
phil was trying to pull a trick that's too slick for his own good ... so i come over here to head him off .
you picked a good way to do it .
i have nothing to do with this .
i don't know anything about murders ...
and i'm never gonna be ...
don't give me that again .
well , what about it?
did you see her do it?
i just seen her and was crossing street to her .
truck got in my way .
if you want to know who killed phil church , ask him .
you heard him threaten what he'd do if we ran off together .
ask him .
you kill my mr. church?
ask him where's his gun .
i've got my gun right here .
don't try to hang this on me .
you kill my mr. church?
sure he did .
he killed phil .
here , come on .
get out of the way .
break it up .
that's enough .
break it up .
all right .
come on , never mind .
break it up !
nickie , do something .
yes , of course .
all right , break it up .
here , now , you spitfire !
there .
sit down there .
you asked for it .
did somebody drop this chip?
yes .
it's mine .
good .
one more session like that , i'll call up the wagon and drag you all downtown .
may i say something?
go ahead .
well , i have a hunch if we find out who murdered macfay ... we'll find out who murdered church .
maybe it'll clear things up if we start from the beginning .
tell me this first .
if you were trying a man for murder ... and he suddenly produced an airtight alibi , what would happen?
he'd go free .
what if after you freed him , you found he'd planned the whole thing ...
what would you do?
nothing .
nothing at all .
i see .
well , thank you very much .
you mean you'd let him get away with it?
well , we'd have to .
you can't try a man for the same crime twice .
if he's acquitted , he could boast about it and we couldn't touch him .
and that was church's plan .
what was?
he advertised himself as the murderer , while his accomplice did the dirty work .
he takes a house on long island .
he threatens macfay , terrorizes the household .
after the murder , he disappears ... still calling attention to himself as the killer .
when things look blackest for him , he walks in here , inviting me to take him .
his plan was to get tried for that murder , spring a last minute alibi ... and walk out of that court scot free .
you mean that he had this alibi all the time?
yes , but he didn't want us to know it .
that's why dum dum beat up a drunk last night when he tried to tell me .
you did?
was that it?
was that why you hit him?
i hit him because he start a fight .
maybe vogel will tell us .
he didn't want it known either .
what are you trying to pull?
your men jumped him , too .
were you in on this?
you think i'd be in on a thing with that rat?
looks bad for you , vogel .
you were down on the island .
you knew the set up .
you tried to keep smitty from talking .
your men threatened me .
told me if i didn't lay off ...
my men?
what men?
the ones who dropped that chip at the west indies club last night .
come on , diamond back , spill it .
okay .
i run a place uptown .
it's ...
well , it's a place .
get what i mean , or should i wait for my lawyer?
we get it .
you don't want to admit you run a gambling joint .
go on .
the night before last , church comes in and sits in for two and a half hours ... including the time macfay was killed on the island .
then you helped him get his alibi .
i tell you i wasn't in this with him .
i didn't know what was going on .
then why did you keep it quiet?
that night a bunch of my best customers were there .
a bank president .
big guys like that .
big and respectable .
if they admit in court they were there , they may as well cut their throats .
so i'm out to get the guys who can spill it .
and your men were out to get me , thank you .
i knew church's plan was good , but i didn't know it was that good .
he was a genius .
let me show you something else he planned .
wait a minute .
let's not talk about church .
he's dead .
it's the killer we're after .
yes , i'm coming to that .
you mean you know who he is?
i have a pretty fair idea ... and if this trick turns out right , i'll be sure .
let's say this is macfay's room and that this is his bed .
we'll fix things just as we found them the night of the murder .
there was a newspaper on the floor .
stop me if i'm wrong .
here's a paper .
let me see .
there were some books .
i'll get those , nickie .
thank you , mommy .
a glass of water .
i'll get it .
no , mrs. bellam , you stay here .
one of the boys will get it .
freddie , would you mind standing there?
surely .
and watch everything very carefully .
a lamp?
i'll get that .
as i remember , a cord was pulled from the lamp .
let's see .
you forgot the gun .
yes , i have my own right here .
there we are .
now , may i have the books , mommy?
you know , this trick should work , church planned it .
and church was an engineer .
here we are .
now , if you'll just let me have the paper .
here's the paper .
thank you .
just one sheet will do .
it was just one sheet that was wet , wasn't it?
yes .
paper serves as a nonconductor .
i'll place this small piece between the exposed wire ... and the metallic part of the gun .
now the water , please .
you watching this carefully , freddie?
yes .
this might be your finish .
now , we'll just drop the water in this indentation .
there you are .
do you mind plugging that in?
thank you .
twelve minutes past .
please step to the other end of the room?
but nothing happens .
give it time .
run , mommy , fast .
anyone for a drink?
but , really , where does all this get us?
remember , you said it was funny that i didn't hear any sounds of a struggle?
well , i did think that ...
i didn't hear anything because there was no struggle .
but all this : his broken wrist , the shot he fired .
macfay didn't fire that shot .
he was dead when it went off .
the murderer staged this whole thing , just as i have ... to make it look as if there'd been a row .
this little trick gave him or her ... a chance to get away and get an alibi .
well , that broken wrist sort of eliminates a woman , doesn't it?
it's easy to break a dead man's wrist .
even a woman could do that .
mrs. bellam .
yes?
you were the last one to see col. macfay , weren't you?
yes .
what time was that?
about midnight .
but you can't say i did it .
he wasn't killed until 1 : 00 .
you mean the shot didn't go off until 1 : 00 .
we don't know yet when he was killed .
you were an old sweetheart of macfay's , weren't you?
weren't you?
what's that got to do with it?
maybe we'd better have everybody in on this .
try the second door down on the left .
the key's in the lock .
who is it?
lf i know my perfumes ... it's dorothy or agnes or whatever her name is .
i haven't done anything .
you let me go .
i haven't anything to do with this .
then what are you doing here?
i came to see mr. charles .
when i came to work for you , i'd gotten out of prison .
good gracious .
i was going straight .
i knew the police wouldn't believe me after the killing , so i lit out .
but i couldn't rest easy .
i had to explain to mr. charles .
why should an ex convict , seek employment ... in the home of a man known to the world as a great detective?
because he never refused a break to anybody in his life .
i meant to prove to them that i could make good .
i was going to tell them .
that's all right .
i knew about you .
wait a moment .
guild says this woman was the one at chestevere apartments .
i'm afraid for once the lieutenant is wrong .
she wasn't .
look , nickie , it's smoking .
it worked .
give me that rod .
i knew it was dum dum all the time .
was it him?
no .
dum dum was only trying to get the accomplice who killed his mr. church .
but who ...
i'm afraid you people haven't been paying attention .
this little trick i just showed you ... gave the murderer five minutes to get away and get an alibi .
there was only one person who used that particular alibi .
church planned this trick and you carried it through .
that's why church had smitty to stooge for him .
so no one would suspect he was mixed up with another woman .
what are you saying?
you're friends with church and dum dum .
that's why your dog was friends with them , let them come and go .
that's why he stood on his hind legs , as the prints showed ... with his paws on his killer's shoulders , when they cut his throat .
if they were friends , why did they kill him?
to avoid suspicion that you and church were working together .
it's a lie .
i killed macfay .
careful , freddie , you know what happened to horn when he tried to protect her .
what do you mean?
i mean that horn must have known that she committed the murder .
he was jittery that night , almost out of control .
he told us he'd had a threat against lois 'life .
that was to divert suspicion from her .
horn wanted to get me off the case .
when i went out on the grounds looking for asta and that knife ... he knew that it would be fairly safe to take a shot at me .
if caught , he'd blame the darkness ... that he mistook me for church or dum dum .
you were afraid of horn , afraid that he might give you away .
besides , you were really stuck on phil church .
so you let horn go out to get me and then you ran on ahead ... and warned me , so that i'd have time to draw a gun on him .
then you pushed me out of the way , figuring that i'd shoot in self defense .
which i might have had to do ... but the police stepped in and did the job for us .
you're guessing , saying horrible things .
only way that makes sense .
sense?
what sense could there possibly be in my killing father?
because you wanted his money and you wanted it now .
he gave me everything i could possibly need .
why he ...
that wasn't your kind of life .
your kind of life was the linda mills life that you've been leading ... ever since you got the nerve to sneak out after the folks went to sleep .
linda mills?
yes , my sweet .
l. m. " for linda mills and lois macfay .
linda mills , who sleeps without pillows just as you do .
linda mills , in whose apartment there's a scorched spot ... and a bullet hole in the wall where this was rehearsed .
why , you can't mean these things .
tell him it isn't true .
it's easy to prove .
we'll just take her to mrs. dolley .
when dum dum comes to , he can tell us ... but i wouldn't advise you to wait for that .
dum dum's a little sore at you for killing his mr. church .
my killing church?
now , really ...
you found out after the murder that he ditched you for smitty .
you knew that he had you in a spot where he could blackmail you for life .
so you shot him as he stood on that ledge and threw the gun out your window .
you're right about linda mills and all the other things .
i got sick of playing little red riding hood to that old guy .
when phil was trying to get money out of him ...
i found we spoke the same language .
i'm not sorry for it .
it was a chance and i took it .
i'll make a deal with you .
and what will you offer us , the moon?
you like that brat of yours , don't you?
all right .
you let me walk out of here and i'll send him back in a half hour .
what did you do with him?
i put him in lois 'room .
go look .
she can look all she wants .
she won't find him .
if anything's happened to that kid ...
is he there?
it isn't him , nickie's gone .
make up your mind .
send me to the chair or get your kid back all in one piece .
wait a minute .
you can't go in there .
i gotta go in there .
i want to go in there .
let me in here .
where's my baby?
where's my raphael?
he's in here .
trying to pull a fast one?
i saw it wasn't their kid and i took a chance .
you can't blame me for trying .
well , come on .
you ungrateful little fiend .
what's the matter , ma?
don't you call me ma .
so you admit it's a gag?
well , better luck on your next racket .
all right , get going .
give me a gun .
what?
another murder?
that dog .
he won't let me have the baby .
asta .
take it easy .
quiet now , will you?
where's my baby?
my raphael , my beautiful baby .
my lovely little cherub .
you can't blame me for making a mistake .
they both look alike , don't they?
you imbecille !
my gorgeous , my beautiful raphael .
all right , don't get excited .
you don't tell me ...
mommy?
let's sit down .
sit down?
what for?
just to get a little rest , after our quiet weekend in the country .
