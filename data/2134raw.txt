is it bad tonight?
bad .
that's one way to describe it .
insane seems a iittle more appropriate .
it feels iike he's breathing down my neck .
it is my professionai opinion we should get the heii out of here .
now .
noted .
clean this place up , then iocate our guests .
i just need to take the edge off .
you know the routine .
i need you clear headed .
first things first .
now , where is he?
show me where he's hiding .
son of a bitch !
you said he only kiiled nine people .
there are 40 victims here .
nine when he was alive .
he's added a few since then .
now where is he , dennis?
aii teams go to alpha .
bring in the cube !
how did this guy get the name " the breaker "?
is he a truck driver?
simple folkiore .
the iocai color exorcising its demons .
maybe it's because he broke his victims into as many pieces as possible .
i hate being rushed .
this one isn't iike the others .
i'ii give you a bonus .
you don't have that kind of money .
after tonight you'ii be surprised .
now , get to work .
careful , dennis .
don't get too curious .
son of a bitch !
how can you justify what you're doing , cyrus?
it's out and out slavery !
you are persistent , damon .
and what about you , kalina?
stiii carrying around those ridiculous quicksilver flares?
you stiii have that quaint magicai book?
these aren't animals you're capturing , they're human beings .
they are dead human beings .
maybe you should join greenpeace .
throw blood on old women's furs .
who are you to play god?
playing is for children .
you'ii never puii it off .
not without the right speils .
that , and the thirteenth ghost .
thirteenth ghost?
get them out of my sight !
we've wasted too much time already .
why did he say thirteenth?
move the cube into position .
what's he talking about , 13 ghosts?
you contracted me for 12 ghosts !
the breaker is 12 !
i'm done after tonight , cyrus .
yes .
twelve and then one more .
i thought you were psychic !
that's not how it works , and you know it !
there's no time to argue .
release the bait !
what bait?
we never needed bait before !
a truck fuii of blood?
you've got to be shitting me .
oh , boy .
now ... ... power up the cube .
start transmitting .
come .
come .

help me !
help me !
oh , shit !
put him down !

cyrus squandered it .
bobby , isn't that great?

cyrus recorded this message six weeks ago .
he asked that it be played for you in the event of his death .
arthur ... ... it's good to talk to you .
sadly , if you're watching this now , it means i am no longer among the living .
happily , that makes you and your family my sole beneficiaries .
i've instructed my lawyer , mr. moss ... ... to deliver the essential elements in my last will and testament .
give it to them , ben .
a key?
a key to what?
a key to your new house .
what?
this house is the fruit of my life's work .
bathrooms .
everyone gets their own bathroom .
is this for real?
it is a one of a kind home .
it's my home , actually .
my home .
i have no complaints .
i've led an interesting life .
i have seen some amazing things .
but the only regret i have , is that i never got to know my nephew arthur ... ... nor appreciate the love of a family , like you have .
this house is my attempt to make up for that .
enjoy .
perhaps we'll meet again ... ... in another life .
wow !
when can we see it?
the house is yours whenever you iike .
i'm heading up there after work .
if you want , you , your wife and kids
time out .
i am not the missus here .
my wife ....
my wife is ....
our mom got burned to death in a fire .
what?
it's true .
that's enough , robert .
mr. moss , exactly where is this place?
a couple hours drive from here , a town called willow grove ... ... just up the parkway .
it's in a gorgeous area .
but i warn you , your uncle liked his privacy .
there isn't a neighbor for miles .
come on .
hurry up .
s u f.
suffocate .
i got it .
i win .
so what?
you think you're so slick .
come on , you guys .
we're almost there .
excited?
yeah .
mom would have freaked over this .
looks iike things are starting to get better , right?
yeah .
that's strange .
dad , it's beautiful .
my god .
i've never seen anything iike it .
cool !
so futuroic .
it's about time somebody showed up .
is this your place?
who are you?
i'm the power guy .
don't touch .
your house is knocking out the power of the whole tri quad area .
i need to get inside and check the breakers .
could you come back tomorrow?
is that a possibility?
tomorrow?
let me see .
there are about 5, 570 houses right now without power .
my bosses kind of frown on that , so ....
weil , that's not reaily our problem , is it?
look , buddy , i've been doing this job for about three weeks .
is there any way you can give me a break here?
sure .
no problem .
thank you .
mr ...?
kriticos .
arthur kriticos .
it's quite a place you've got .
yeah .
we're moving in .
one step at a time .
that's odd .
dad , you broke it .
bobby , give it a rest .
heilo .
wow !
you can see right through it .
you guys couldn't afford any wails?
how weird .
guess uncle cyrus wasn't too keen on privacy .
i hope the bathroom's in the basement .
it's iike a funhouse .
it's latin .
everything's so beautiful .
family , just so we're aii clear , miss maggie does not do windows .
wow !
what an incredible wealth of knowledge .
a samurai sword .
in your dreams , pal .
dad , this stuff must be worth a fortune .
yeah , that occurred to me , too .
oh , cyrus .
you crazy son of a bitch , what did you do?
goodness .
it's iike a cathedral .
no throwing stones .
it's marvelous , though , isn't it?
a iiving work of art .
the sooner you show me where you hid the basement ... ... the sooner i can get my ass out of here .
i believe it's down the hail .
it's two doors on the right .
excuse me .
the construction is amazing .
i'm getting dizzy .
bobby .
don't touch anything .
okay?
at ieast untii we get property insurance .
arthur , we've got some papers to sign in the iibrary .
after that , i'd love to give you and your family a tour of the house .
great .
i don't want you guys to move from this spot .
we'ii be right back .
you're being paranoid and overprotective .
yeah , of aii this stuff .
i know you guys too weil .

i mean it .
what the ...?
where'd you hide your money , old man?
shit !
what the heii was that?
oh , no .
oh , cyrus .
now i know i'm dreaming .
was cyrus a hunter?
you could say that .
your uncle was quite a coilector of many things .
i've marked where you're supposed to sign , arthur .
okay , iook .
i didn't want to bring this up in front of the kids ... ... but this place is beyond amazing .
i'm just a math teacher .
the taxes alone must be ....
i have nothing set aside .
to be honest , a fire took away everything .
arthur , you don't need to worry .
cyrus was a genius when it came to finances .
basicaily , you and your family never have to worry about money again .
son of a bitch .
lookee here .
look , y'ail .
look , iook !
sign .
arthur?
arthur , we've got to ....
we have to talk .
what is the deai with the breakers?

who's dennis rafkin?
my office warned me about this guy .
i know this wiii sound completely whacked , but stay with me .
i used to hunt displaced spirituai energies with your uncle .

this has to be my room .
there are toys everywhere .
i wonder what my room's iike .

cyrus has containment cubes aii over the basement .
i don't know why they're here ... ... and i am not staying around to find out .

what are these?
that's a iittle harder to explain .
they're containment speils .
ghosts can't cross those .
ghosts?
yes , ghosts .
the supernaturai realm has its own iaws .
for ghosts , it's speils .
written or spoken , the ghosts have to obey whatever the speils say .
the entire basement is fiiled with ghosts .
in this basement?
of course , in this basement .
if it was next door , i wouldn't give a shit !
dad !
i can prove it .
i gave a pair of those to bobby .

a ghost .
just iike i've been saying aii night !
finaily , a believer !
ghosts are around us aii the time .
most of them can't hurt us .
most don't want to .
ghosts here , ghosts there , no one cares .
but there are exceptions , iike this bad ass behind me .
those who die violently stay in a tortured realm , so that's aii they know .
what is he doing?
i don't know .
i can't see .
i don't have the glasses .
i've had it with this .

victims?
cyrus had a nasty habit of enslaving souls .
that's why i'm here .
i intend to set them aii free .
listen to me .
i need to know ... ... how you got in here .
i slipped through an opening in the house when it shifted .
an opening where?
it's closed now .
it won't happen again .
let me show you .
this is the arcanum .
many people died in the quest for this book .
it was written in the 15th century by an astrologer named basileus .
in it , he describes the making of a certain machine .
one that can see into the future .
he wrote it while he was under demonic possession .
i can't believe cyrus built it .
built what?
what are you talking about?
basileus's device .
we're in the middle of a machine , designed by the devii and powered by the dead .
listen to me .
i don't give a shit about any machine ... ... or devii or basileus or anything ... ... except getting my family the heii out of this place .
i came here to set the souls in this house free .
you want help , you have to help me first .
kathy , can you walk?
kathy !
oh , no .

how could you help him without knowing what he was doing?
i had my reasons .
money , you parasite .
you stole people's souls for money !
how depraved is that?
if you haven't noticed , i'm a bit of a freak !
i come within 10 feet of anything dead , i go into seizures .
i touch somebody , a whole iife fuii of shit flashes in front of my eyes .
so , yeah , i'm depraved .
but cyrus was my friend , and he accepted me .
he didn't accept you .
you're so pathetic !
he used you .
shut up , both of you .
cut him some slack .
what difference does it make?
you didn't teii him , did you?
teii me what?
what now?
about the fourth ghost .
don't do this .
i didn't teii him .
he has a right to know .
what about the fourth ghost?
st. luke's hospital .
six months ago .
you're saying my wife's spirit ... ... is trapped in this house?
i didn't know you .
i didn't know her .
i didn't know she had a husband .
why?
in god's name , why?
teii me , why her?
i don't know .
cyrus handpicked them , including your wife .
i figured out who you were and i've been trying to help you .
you caii this help?
she's right !
this is aii your goddamn fault !
son of a bitch !
you can save her .
and your kids , too .
just iisten to me and believe me .
this house is not a house .
it is a machine .
a complete and faithfui re creation of basileus's design .
according to this , there should be 12 earth bound spirits trapped inside .
see these?
they represent the black zodiac .
the first born son .
i don't want to play .
the torso .
the bound woman .
the withered lover .
jean .
bobby .
i love you .
the torn prince .
the angry princess .
i'm sorry .
the pilgrimess .
the great child and the dire mother .
the hammer .
the jackal .
and the juggernaut .
the machine required the energy ... ... of these specific spirits in order to bring it to iife .
once it engages , the spirits are released one by one .
the house then draws them to its center .
each one adds its energy to the machine , powering it up .
powering it up for what?
to open the ocularis lnfernum .
what's that?
it's latin .
ocularis lnfernum .
the eye of heil?
very good .
the eye of heil .
i'm stuck in a glass house with crazy white people ....
go on .
in heil , there is an eye that sees everything , the past , the future ... ... heaven and earth , the blessed , the damned .
if knowledge is power , then the man who controls the ocularis ... ... would be the most powerfui man on earth .
your uncle .
great .
so ... ... how many ghosts have been set free?
eleven .
and the house needs twelve .
no .
damon said something about thirteen .
that there are thirteen ghosts .
the thirteenth ghost is a fail safe .
to stop the process , the house needs a sacrifice of iife instead of death .
a wiiling , human sacrifice .
a sacrifice of the broken heart .
the only ghost to be created out of an act of pure iove .
you're the thirteenth ghost .
the thirteenth spirit stands before the eye at the finai configuration .
as the eye opens , the spirit uses the power of iife ... ... to short circuit the system .
uses the power of iife how?
by ieaping into the eye .
and arthur's supposed to take this ieap?
no fucking way , iady .
that's suicide .
i won't iet you do it .
you need to come up with something else .
that's not working .
love is the most powerfui energy .
meaning?
in order for you to save your children , you must trade your iife for theirs .
let me see this .
there's got to be a better way .
i don't read latin .
weil , we can try it the old fashioned way , my personai favorite .
nobody wiii be here to brag about it afterwards .
we need to come up with a game plan soon .
time's running out .
are you going to blow the place up?
the iast ghost is about to be released .
i know why you feei you have to do this .
get away from me .
psychics caii it a " iinking .
we iinked earlier .
i saw everything ... ... about jean , about you .
shut up .
i'm not going to iisten to this from you .
kalina is talking about suicide .
anything to save my kids .
it doesn't add up .
it doesn't make any sense .
there's got to be a better way .
doesn't add up "?
what does add up here , dennis?
how much of this equation makes any sense at ail?
goddamn it .
goddamn it .
aii i can think about are my kids .
i don't even know if they're alive .
then iet's go out there and find out .
one iast time , while there's stiii time , you and me .
kalina ... ... no matter what i decide to do , or what happens to any of us ... ... are you sure you can you stop that machine?
i've got enough explosives to blow us back to the 15th century .
okay .
how many flares do you have ieft?
one , why?
we're going out again .
no fucking way , arthur .
you're going to get yourself kiiled .
not if we take that .
ten minutes untii the ectoplasmic shit hits the fan .
go .
we'ii go down and buy you some time .
after you , captain america .
damn .
i just got my nails done .
here .
put these on .
come on , iet's go !
there's no place iike home .
there's no place iike home .
there's no place iike home .
there's no place iike home .
knock it off , dennis .
just keep your eyes open .
i sure hope i don't bleed to death .
that would suck .

oh , my god .
he definitely iooked better .
oh , my god .

girl , hurry up !

kalina , get over here !
this flare shit ain't working !
hurry up !
where is it?
where is it?
kalina?
why are you so mad at me?
i did everything you asked me to do .
i kiiled damon , i stole his speils .
i made sure your pathetic nephew didn't get himself kiiled !
kalina !
where are the speils?
you're not mad at me , are you?
of course not .
what is it?
oh , shit .
there's only room for one of us .
what are you doing?
don't worry , i've been iooking for a reason to iike myself for a iong time .
dennis , don't do this !
hey , bro .
you ain't nothing but a bitch !
dennis , no !
oh , my god .
what do we do now?
your nephew believes that sacrificing himself wiii save his kids .
but he won't do it unless his kids are in jeopardy .
weil , put them in jeopardy .
what?
why not?
but they're kids .
greatness requires sacrifice .
now , i have a job to do .
and so have you .
do it .
do it !
yes .
and now to finish this .
oh , my god .
jean .
i loved you so much .
i miss you .

i'm nothing without you .

kathy , i'm scared !
kathy !
kathy !
bobby !
daddy !
bobby !
dad , help !

you ioser !
i've dedicated my entire iife to this .
every waking moment , for years .
have you ever shown that kind of dedication?
have you?
the world has no time for iittle people iike you .
it needs people who are wiiling to do anything !
anything for greatness .
you don't have a choice this time , arthur .
you wiii make that ieap .
the machine requires a ghost to be created ... ... out of an act of pure iove .
