mutants .
since the discovery of their existence , they have been regarded with fear , suspicion , often hatred .
across the planet debate rages .
are mutants the next link in the evolutionary chain?
or simply a new species of humanity , fighting for their share of the world?
either way , it is an historical fact sharing the world has never been humanity's defining attribute .
we are not enemies , but friends .
we must not be enemies .
though passion may have strained , it must not break the bonds of our affection .
lincoln said that in his first inaugural address as our nation's 16th president .
it's one of my favourites .
lf you'll please have your tickets ready , we can begin the tour .
jackie , clear my schedule .
i'm having dinner with my son .
yes , mr president .
excuse me , sir .
are you lost?
perimeter breach at visitors 'checkpoint .
multiple subjects .
mr president , security breach .
jackie , leave .
get him to the car .
exits not clear .
unknown how many .
both sides secure .
something's in the corridor .
to the shelter .
not clear .
it's outside the oval office .
lock this place down .
don't shoot !
my god .
neanderthals .
we once believed that they were wiped out by years of conflict with the much more advanced branch of humanity called cro magnon man , but recent research into our dna suggests that these two species may have interbred , evolving into modern humans .
ln other words , into what?
us .
that's right .
artie .
not here .
come on .
pay attention .
.. makes me insane when she does this ...
what are you looking at?
sick ...
to the shelter .
they're gonna kill him .
jean?
you ok?
yeah , i'm fine .
it's just a headache .
it's notjust a headache , is it?
i wasn't sure how to say this , but since liberty lsland you've been ...
scott .
you've been different .
my telepathy's been off lately .
i can't focus .
i hear everything .
jean , it's notjust your telepathy .
a month ago you had to concentrate just to levitate a book .
now when you have a nightmare the entire bedroom shakes .
my dreams are getting worse .
i keep feeling something terrible's about to happen .
i would never let anything happen to you .
have you guys seen bobby and rogue?
something's happening in the food court .
it's a simple question .
why are you being a dick?
yeah , why are you being such a dick?
because i can .
can i have a light?
sorry .
can't help you out , pal .
john , knock it off .
why don't you stop showing off?
for her?
i can't help it if your girl's getting excited .
she isn't .
we're trying to have a good time .
you're the only one having a good time .
that's real cute , man .
what are you gonna do?
suddenly you're not so tough .
bobby , what did you do?
i didn't do this .
no .
i did .
and the next time you feel like showing off , don't .
breaking news .
we're live from washington , where there's been an attack in the oval office of the white house .
we have been informed that the president and vice president were not harmed .
sources say the attack involved one or more mutants ...
i think it's time to leave , professor .
i think you're right .
ln my opinion , magneto's behind this .
i don't think so , scott .
while eric could organise something like this from prison , it would be irrational and only hurt his goal of mutant prosperity .
you mean superiority .
you're right , if eric had his way .
and , of course , the government will reintroduce the registration act .
or worse .
the president could declare a state of emergency , place every mutant under arrest .
do you think the assassin worked alone?
we'll only know that if we find him first .
i've been trying to track him using cerebro , but his movements are inexplicably erratic .
when i have exact coordinates , storm , jean , i'll need you to take the jet and pick him up .
it was close , wasn't it?
closer than anyone's admitted .
what do you need , william?
your authorisation for a special operation .
no , thank you , mr president .
i thought you were here to talk about school reform .
funny you should say that , mr president .
senator .
mr president .
thank you for having me .
senator kelly , colonel william stryker .
how do you do?
his department has been dealing with the mutant phenomenon since before my time .
you were a staunch supporter of the registration act , but it seems your ideas on the mutant problem have changed .
for the best , i hope .
so what are you proposing , mr stryker?
may i , mr president?
we've managed to gather evidence of a mutant training facility in the salem region of upstate new york .
where did you get this information?
lnterrogation of one of the mutant terrorists from the liberty lsland incident .
eric lehnsherr?
you have access to him?
magneto , yes .
we developed the technology that built his plastic prison .
this facility is a school .
sure it is .
what the hell is that?
ajet .
what kind ofjet?
we don't know .
but it comes up out of the basketball court .
lf we'd been allowed to do ourjobs before this incident ...
all right , listen .
william , you enter , you detain , you question , but the last thing we need to see is the body of a mutant kid on the six o'clock news .
mr stryker?
senator kelly .
this is yuriko , my personal assistant .
quite a handshake .
what can i do for you?
eric lehnsherr's prison .
i'd like to arrange a visit .
it isn't a petting zoo , senator .
ln this conflict he is the enemy , you're just a spectator , so why not sit this one out?
conflict?
mr stryker , do you really want to turn this into some kind of war?
i was piloting black ops missions in north vietnam while you were sucking on your mama's tit at woodstock .
don't lecture me about war .
this already is a war .
you're dead .
you're so dead .
you're dead .
i don't wanna hurt you .
i'm not afraid .
logan .
you miss me , kid?
not really .
how are you doing?
i'm ok .
how are you?
who's this?
this is bobby .
he's my ...
i'm her boyfriend .
call me lce man .
right .
boyfriend?
so how do you guys ...?
we're still working on that .
look who's come back .
just in time .
for what?
we need a baby sitter .
baby sitter?
nice to see you again , logan .
hi , logan .
hi , jean .
i should go and get the jet ready .
well , it was good to meet you .
come on , let's go .
bye , logan .
i'll see you later .
storm and i are heading to boston .
we won't be gone long .
the professor wants us to find a mutant who attacked the president .
so it was a mutant .
you'll be here when we get back , unless you plan on running off again .
i could probably think of a few reasons to stick around .
find what you were looking for , logan?
more or less .
i'll see you boys later .
be safe , ok?
you too .
bye .
see ya .
aren't you gonna welcome me home?
your bike needs gas .
then fill her up .
mr laurio , how long can we keep this up?
how long is your sentence?
forever .
not necessarily forever , mr lehnsherr .
just until i've got all that i need .
mr stryker , how kind of you to visit .
have you come back to ensure the taxpayers 'dollars are keeping me comfortable?
done .
you can go .
now ...
mr lehnsherr .
i'd like to have one final talk about the house that xavier built and the machine called cerebro .
my tolerance for your smoking in the mansion notwithstanding , smoke that in here and you'll spend the rest of your days under the belief you are a six year old girl .
can you do that?
i'd have jean braid your hair .
welcome back .
you want me to leave?
no .
just don't move .
these lights represent every living person on the planet .
the white lights are humans .
and these are the mutants .
through cerebro i'm connected to them , and they to me .
you see , logan?
we're not as alone as you think .
i found the base at alkali lake .
there was nothing there .
the broken line represents the path of the mutant who attacked the president .
i've been finding it difficult to get a lock on it .
can't you just concentrate harder?
lf i wanted to kill him , yes .
there .
looks like he's finally stopped running .
i need you to read my mind again .
the results will be the same as before .
we had a deal .
the mind is not a box that can be simply unlocked .
it's a beehive with a million ...
spare me the lecture .
i've no doubt your amnesia , your adamantium skeleton , the claws are all connected , but ...
logan , sometimes the mind needs to discover things for itself .
i promise you we'll talk again when i return .
lf you would be kind enough to watch over the children tonight .
scott and i are going to visit an old friend .
i'm sending the coordinates of where the mutant's settled .
as soon as you find him , bring him back to the mansion .
let's hope he cooperates .
yes , for his sake .
good luck .
stryker , william .
what are you doing in here?
garbage .
these are the coordinates .
he's a teleporter .
must be why the professor had trouble locating him .
we're not here to hurt you .
we just wanna talk .
are you bored yet?
oh , yeah .
sure you don't wanna come down?
you have him?
he's not going anywhere .
are you?
please don't kill me .
i didn't mean to harm anyone .
why would people have gotten that impression?
what's your name?
wagner .
kurt wagner .
there was so much shooting , such fear .
and then there was only pain .
i could see it all happening , but i couldn't stop myself .
it was like a bad dream .
perhaps he is testing me .
and before you were in the white house , what do you remember?
nothing .
i was here .
i'd rather get him back to the professor .
the professor?
did you do these yourself?
and what about this?
i need you to read my mind again .
the results will be the same as before .
you'll be indestructible .
no memory .
sometimes the mind needs to discover things for itself .
wolverine .
no memory .
you'll have no memory .
can't sleep?
how can you tell?
cos you're awake .
right .
how about you?
i don't sleep .
doesn't anybody sleep around here?
apparently not .
got any beer?
this is a school .
so that's a no?
yeah , that's a no .
ls there anything other than chocolate milk?
there's soda in that cupboard .
thanks .
no problem .
i'll take him from here .
it's all right , scott .
nice shades .
thanks .
charles xavier .
have you come to rescue me?
sorry , eric , not today .
to what do i owe the pleasure?
the assassination attempt .
what do you know about it?
nothing .
only what i read in the papers .
you really shouldn't have to ask .
what's happened to you?
i've had frequent visits from william stryker .
you remember him , don't you?
his son , jason , was once a student of yours , wasn't he?
yes .
years ago .
unfortunately , i wasn't able to help him .
at least , not in the way his father wanted .
and now you think taking in wolverine will make up for your failure with stryker's son?
how long you been here?
a couple of years .
and your parents just sent you off to mutant school?
actually , my parents think this is a prep school .
i see .
well , i suppose lots of prep schools have their own dorms , campuses ...
jets .
so you and rogue .
it's not what you think .
i'd like it to be , but it's just ...
it's just that it's not easy when you wanna be closer to someone , but you can't .
i've seen how you look at dr grey .
excuse me?
nothin '.
logan's mind is still fragile .
ls it?
or are you afraid of losing one of your precious x men , old friend?
eric , what have you done?
i'm sorry , charles .
i couldn't help it .
what have you told stryker?
everything .
the war has begun .
scott !
you should have killed me when you had the chance .
but now and then every mother needs to get away .
without her , the babies are helpless ...
hi .
what is it?
you picked the wrong house .
you all right?
stay here .
this way .
let's go .
john !
where's rogue?
i don't know .
i gotta find her .
open it .
here , take her .
go on , get in .
let's go .
come on .
take him .
he's stunned .
i can help you .
help them .
rogue !
bobby !
this way .
come on .
everybody , follow me up here .
move .
come on .
let's go .
come on , this way .
this is it .
logan .
you wanna shoot me , shoot me .
don't shoot him .
not yet .
wolverine?
i must admit this is certainly the last place i'd expect to find you .
how long has it been?
15 years?
you haven't changed one bit .
me , on the other hand ...
nature .
wait .
we've gotta do something .
they'll kill him .
he can handle himself .
let's go .
bobby .
please .
i didn't realise xavier was taking in animals , even animals as unique as you .
who are you?
don't you remember?
no !
logan , come on .
let's go .
go .
i'll be fine .
but we won't .
go .
keep going .
right , get in .
i'm driving .
maybe next time .
this is cyclops's car .
oh , yeah?
what the hell was that back there?
stryker .
his name is stryker .
who is he?
i can't remember .
here .
this is yours .
i hate uncomfortable silences .
what are you doing?
i don't think that's his cd player .
sit back .
where are we going?
storm and jean are in boston .
we'll head that way .
my parents live in boston .
good .
sergeant?
most of the mutants escaped through a series of tunnels .
we have some in custody .
how many?
six , sir .
welcome , professor .
take what we need , gentlemen .
this protest underscores a growing concern among most americans .
mutant registration ...
why stop there?
it'd be easier to round up mutants by the truckload .
or maybe you'd like an all out war?
oh , please .
turn that shit off , lou .
a lot on your mind?
mr laurio?
i'm grace .
you want another beer?
of course you do .
you're really aggressive .
yes , i am .
i've never hooked up with a girl like you before .
i know .
it's kind of dirty in here , don't you think?
that's the idea .
velcro?
nice .
bottoms up .
i certainly hope so .
bottoms up .
william ...
please , xavier , don't get up .
i call it the neural inhibitor .
it keeps you outta here .
what have you done with scott?
don't worry .
i'm just giving him a little re education .
of course , you know all about that , don't you?
you wanted me to cure your son , but mutation is not a disease .
you're lying .
you were more frightened of him than i was .
just one year after jason returned from your school , my wife ...
you see , he resented us .
he blamed us for his condition , so he would toy with our minds , projecting visions and scenarios into our brains .
my wife , in the end , she took a power drill to her left temple in an attempt to bore the images out .
my boy the great illusionist .
for someone who hates mutants , you certainly keep some strange company .
they serve their purpose , as long as they can be controlled .
you arranged the attack on the president .
you didn't even have to read my mind .
i've been working with mutants as long as you have , xavier , but the most frustrating thing i've learned is nobody really knows how many even exist or how to find them .
except you .
unfortunately , this little potion won't work on you , will it?
you're much too powerful for that .
lnstead , we'll go right to the source .
allow me to introduce mutant 14 .
the fluid secreted by his brain acts as a mind controlling agent .
but that's only where it begins .
jason?
my god , william .
this is your son .
what have you done to him?
no , charles .
my son is dead .
just like the rest of you .
mom?
dad?
ronny? ls anybody home?
i'll try and find you some clothes .
don't burn anything .
i found some of my mom's old clothes .
i think they're from before i was born .
groovy .
hello?
jean .
where are you?
these are my grandmother's .
thanks .
you won't hurt me .
wow .
i'm sorry .
it's ok .
ronny , next time you ...
who the hell are you?
aren't you supposed to be at school?
bobby , who is this guy?
this is professor logan .
there's something i need to tell you .
you're clear .
have a nice sleep , lehnsherr?
there's something different about you .
yeah .
i was having a good day .
it's not that .
sit down .
sit your ass down .
what could it be?
what are you doin '?
there it is .
too much iron in your blood .
mr laurio , never trust a beautiful woman , especially one who's interested in you .
when did you first know you were a ...
a mutant?
would you cut that out?
you have to understand .
we thought bobby was going to a school for the gifted .
bobby is gifted .
we know .
we just didn't realise ...
we still love you , bobby .
it's just this mutant problem is a little ...
what mutant problem?
.. complicated .
what exactly are you a professor of?
art .
you should see what bobby can do .
i can do a lot more than that .
this is all my fault .
actually , it's males that carry the mutant gene and pass it on , so it's his fault .
911 .
please state your emergency .
i need the police .
there are people in our house .
they won't let us leave .
it's believed a manhunt for several fugitives from the facility is now under way .
nobody's responding .
i can't get a signal .
why don't you take a break?
i'll keep trying .
what are they?
they're angelic symbols passed on to mankind by the archangel gabriel .
they're beautiful .
how many do you have?
one for every sin .
so quite a few .
you and miss grey are schoolteachers?
yes .
at a school for people like us , where we can be safe .
safe from what?
everyone else .
outside of the circus most people were afraid of me .
but i didn't hate them .
i pitied them .
do you know why?
most people will never know anything beyond what they see with their own eyes .
i gave up on pity a long time ago .
someone so beautiful should not be so angry .
sometimes anger can help you survive .
so can faith .
storm , i found an active com device .
where?
oh , god .
it's for me .
have you tried not being a mutant?
no one's left , jean .
soldiers came .
what about the children?
i saw them escape .
not sure about the rest .
we can't reach the professor or scott either .
where are you?
boston , with bobby drake's family .
ok .
we're on our way .
and , storm , make it fast .
we have to go now .
why?
logan , what's wrong?
drop the knives and put your hands in the air .
what's going on here?
ronny .
i said drop the knives .
open the door .
break it .
turn around .
up against the wall .
this is just a misunderstanding .
put the knives down .
i can't .
look .
the rest of you , on the ground now .
kid , i said on the ground .
we don't wanna hurt you , kid .
you know all those dangerous mutants you hear about on the news?
i'm the worst one .
get down .
who the hell is this?
kurt wagner .
ln the circus i was known as " the lncredible nightcrawler " .
save it .
storm .
we're outta here .
jason , stop it .
