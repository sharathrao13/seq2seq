not all rich kids are soulless and ... not all psychologists care about dreams .
the question is howyou got here and whyyou've been charged .
what do you want to kknow?
i was about to turn 33 .
i ran three magazines and a worldwide publishing house .
most days i fooled myselfinto believing it would last forever .
isn 't that what being young is about?
believing secretly that you would be ... the one person in the history ofman ... who would live forever .

why not? .
i'll start to think we're married .

good cop , bad cop  that you're a daddy's boy? .
primer on david aames senior .
my father wasn't built forthe 21st century .
he never went to mcdonald's , not once .
he never watched television , andyet ... his bi ggest magazine is still the tv digest .
he and my mother threw the grandest parties ofthe literary world .
ballooned .
jumped out ofairplanes .
he sought adventure .
his autobiography is the manual ... for every cutthroat publisher in new yorkk city .
it's called defending the kingdom .
i've read it .
page 1 27
david jr . was a delight as a child .
did i miss something here? .
was that all he wrote about you? .
i don't think he ever got over the fact ... that i'm absolutely ... terrified of heights .
the irony continues .
when he and my mother were run over by a drunken teenager ... on new year's eve ten years ago ... he left the keys ... to the kkingdom ... to me .
fifty one percent control .
forty nine percent going to a group ofseven board members ... who all thought they were first in line .
andyou believe the board the seven dwarfs put you here to take control of your company? .
what do you care? .
we're just talking .
and tonight's wednesday night ... and i go to black angus for dinner with my two daughters on wednesdays .
so i'll have to leave soon .
you do understand that our time is limited , don't you? .
if i talk ... you'll just think i'm crazy .
with all the possible respect i can offer a man ... wearing a latex mask and spouting conspiracy theories , david ... believe me , you've crossed that bridge .
enjoy your dinner .
there are five basic emotions in life , david .
tell me , what emotion gripped him ... before he entered that cell? .
was it guilt ... hate ... shame ... revenge ...
love? .
i'm completely on the wrong track , aren't i? .
who needs ice? .
david , happy birthday .
you have got the greatest taste in shoes , bar none anywhere .
emma , have you met lynette? .
i fear what we may have in common .
david , did you invite the entire olympic snowboarding team? .
tonight is my birthday .
say happy birthday to david .
happy birthday .
welcome to graceland .
happy birthday , you son of a bitch .
happy birthday .
hey , friends of me , hello .

literary god , brian shelby .
happy birthday .
and all the usual shit people say to each other

the pleasure of sofia serrano .

sorry about my coat .
it's too big foryour closet .
we were pretending to be intellectuals .
it's amazing .
i love your coat .
i overdressed .
i mean , i underdressed .
i'll continue like you're both actually listening to me .

i have ceased to exist .
madison square garden is nearby .
it might fit there .
happy birthday .
we picked it out together .
thankyou .
we picked it out together .

you're welcome .
stop flirting and open it .
let's get a drink .
yes .
i'll leave this upstairs .
i'll be right back .
okay .
listen .
hey , tommy .
no , no , don't blow me off .
i'm all packed .
i'm going back to london and i understand .
you put me up for the other attorney's job so you didn't have to fire me .
that's a classy move and your father would have done the same .
it's okay , tommy .
i became incompetent .
is there anything more unbecoming than an aging mascot? .
i cared foryour father .
i lived and breathed for him .
these guys , the seven dwarfs ... they thinkyou're stupid a corporate hazard , a rogue .
they are gonna find a way to get you out , david .
they're lined up for your office , your life ...
they're lined up foryour office , your life ... your position .
they're working day and night ... to cheat you out ofyour 51 %% vote .
and they're gonna sell this tradition ofwords ... so they can eat in a better cafeteria .
but what they don't know is this .
people will read again !
i got it .
they even got a nickname foryou behind your back .
citizen dildo .
you got great instincts ... but i say this with complete love .
claim your life ...
learn to be an asshole
two's enough .
forgive me .
i still believe in this family , david ... even if it's only you .
get tipp out of here .
drive him home , and in the morning ... tell him he's rehired with a 50 % raise .
give him that big office across the hall from the seven dwarfs .
and set up a meeting with the other attorneys .
i'm gonna be in early tomorrow .
well , earlier than usual .
hello , handsome .
i've come to wish you a happy birthday .
oh , man .
i didn't invite you, julie .
that was a little weird .
that's how it works with parties you have to be invited .
i'm mad at you , you dick .
we made love four times the other night .
is that good? .
two's good .
three is very good .
but four  four's pretty good? .
four is
four is what? .
hold me , and then i'll leave .
and you can go back and talk to that cute brunette .
four is what? .
i don't wanna meet your fancy friends .
i knew them when i was fancy too .
four is what? .
she looks like a moth .
a moth? .
sometimes i worry about you , that some clever girl ... in a big silly coat is gonna come along and play you just right .
then i'll lose my friend .
and there won't be any chicken soup parties for me and you .
bad .
when will you call me? .
don't say " soon .
i hate it when you say " soon .
danny bramson gave him that for his birthday last year .
so this is what's become of rock and roll a smashed guitar behind a glass case displayed on some rich guy's wall .
it was a gift , actually .
i like it .
whoa , whoa , whoa .
so how did you get all this stuff this apartment , this life? .
i see .
how 'bout ifyou help me , unless i'm horning in here .
you are , but the food's good .
i have a problem .
i got a stalker .
it doesn't sound life threatening .
i need foryou to pretend we are having a scintillating conversation ... and you are wildly entertained .
i know it's tough .
i'll improvise .
she's across the room and burning a hole in my back now , isn't she? .
red dress , strappy shoes? .
wow .
she's really staring at you .
shit .
and she seems to be crying .
less happy .
i think she's the saddest girl to ever hold a martini .
jennifer kelly .
hi, jennifer .
you have another apartment .
sort of a day office .
come on .
i am not going in there .
i am .
good night .
i hear her coming .
really? .
hi .
how are you? .
we're safe , but i've got nothing to drink .
who did these paintings? .
this is joni mitchell .
this one is monet .
and this one ... was done by me .
it is a snowboard .
well , two of them are geniuses .
that is the real thing .
his paintbrush painted the vanilla sky .
and his canvas .
my mother's .
i'm surprised you're surprised .
i can't keep this banter going .
me neither .
i caught you .
brian , come in here .
what's going on? .
your friends are fun and i'm drunk .
julie gianni is stalking me .
she looked dangerous .
nobody stalks me , so i drink .
we're all out up here .

it's the stupid guy holding it .
don't worry .
no big deal .

i drank too much and i didn't eat .
the party's just starting .
foryou it is .
you cannot go .
you are my guest of honor .
fuckyou , david .
you're paying me to write my novel , so you own me .
i don't own you .
you are brilliant , good looking , handsome .

i wasn't hitting on sofia .

i'm crazy .
i'm blind .
you're not blind .
you're drinking jack and when you do you start in with that ...
frank sinatra , she shot me down ... give me a cigarette king of sad thing .
that i do .
give me a cigarette .
i'll find one .
wait .
you're rich and women love you and i'm from ohio and drunk .
can i tell you the truth? .
everybody does .
i dig her .
and i've never said this to you before about any girl ... but she could be could be could be could be the girl of my fucking dreams .
you're not from ohio .
i know .
but if she fucks up our friendship , she can go to hell .
i won't allow it .
we are bros .
i feel the same way .
sure you do .
hi .
how you doing? .
thankyou .
you're welcome .
where are you going? .
i am frank , and frank must go .

i'll go with you .
stay , baby .
i'll give you a ride home later .
no , i have to work tomorrow .
you
you are in great hands .
i'm just humoring myself that my opinion matters .
you will never know the exquisite pain ... of the guy who goes home alone ... because without the bitter , baby , the sweet ain't as sweet .
have a good time .
the sweet and sour speech again .
why are you scared of heights? .
many people are scared of heights .
it's not the height that bothers me .
it's the impact that terrifies me .
i won't stay long .
hey , paolo .
hello .
i have to take you for a walk .
i'm glad he protects you .
he's a lethal canine .
i love living here , and i refuse to clean up .
no problem .
i have to work around the clock to keep this place .
you really are a dancer .
for 1 4 years .
but i don't dance like you dance .
do you want something to drink? .
sure .
hey , beautiful , beautiful boy .
what do you want for dinner tonight? .
do you want fried chicken? .
i like your life .
well , it's mine and you can't have it .
i don't wanna know the story behind this photo .
who's sergio? .
it's a nickname .
your nickname is sergio? .
it's a long story .
and we don't know each other .
so many secrets .
that's because i'm an arms dealer .
i've never known an arms dealer .
you do now .
what about you? .
what's your nickname? .
citizen dildo .
you are not staying over .
never run a company .
stay an artist .
stay an arms dealer .
oh , please .
somehow i can't play the violin foryou .
although , it must be difficult controlling all those people's lives .
everyone at that party is connected to you for survival in some way .
it seems .
ever been married? .
did you ever accept any ofyour 1 2, 000 proposals? .
twelve thousand and eight .
no .
and you moved to new york to dance , paint , act and deal arms? .
right .
do you wanna hear jeff buckley or vicki carr? .
jeff buckley or vicki carr? .
both simultaneously .
everyone said , " don't go to new york .
i just think good things will happen ... ifyou're a good person with a good attitude .
don't you think? .
you think i'm naive? .
no .
i really don't .
i dug her completely .
somehow i'd found the last semi guyless girl in new yorkk city .
i have to get to sleep .
truthfully , i also work mornings as a dental assistant .
boy , am i going to the wrong dentist .
andyou didn't immediately wanna sleep with her?
well , you kknow , i'm a pleasure delayer .
how does that work? .
pleasure delayer?
you don't know? .
you keep a relationship casual ... until the absolute breakking point .
and then one evening or afternoon or morning it could be months from now .
you know how it works .
no , actually i don't .
i've been married for 22 years .
you've got dinner with your daughters .
that's right , i do .
back then i had intricate systems with women ... you wouldn't believe .
like what? .
hey , doc , don't get melancholy over the 30 seconds you were single ... a long time ago .
that's what you think i'm doing? .
oh , yes .
you might be right .
let's continue .
time is not our friend .
just our shortcomings , that's all we're allowed to draw .
i've never drawn such a true likeness before .
mine's finished .
already? .
done .
that's how you see me? .
maybe i didn't add enough money .
no , something you'd see on a wall in a steak house in hell .
it's wonderful .
sign it .
let's see yours .
give me that .
i feel bad .
you said to draw a caricature .
i know .
i couldn't .
i saw you like that .
it's very good .
i'll sell it to you .
you monster .
how much for it? .
one kiss .
that smile is gonna be the end of me .
and what happens when your friend calls you tomorrow? .
he just met you a few hours before me .
he'd do the same .
i see that friendship is important to you .
it is .
it is .
and as his best friend ...
i know he's trying to finish a novel about inadequacy and rejection .
so the longer that i stay , the better it is for his career .
your career is the one i'd worry about .
sorry .
no .
no , you're more right than you even know .
i used to be one of those guys that just ... snowboarded through his life ... with no focus ... whatsoever .
when did you change? .
about five minutes ago .
every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around .
and to those who thinkk thatyou're a charlatan?
i understand .
the perception ofa head frozen somewhere ... waiting for reanimation sounds likke science fiction .
what are you watching? .
it's the greatest show .
it's called sofia .
it is at the frontier ofa new science .
life extension .
how do you accomplish such a thing?
i've seen this 30 times .
life is full ofsurprises .
but the greatest surprise ofall is that this doesn 't have to end ever .
we did a story on this guy .
he owns half of arizona .
is he a fraud? .
how would you ever know? .
good point .
can you unfreeze a human life?
takke the case ofbenny the dog .
benny's a dog .
he was frozen for three months and thawed out to live a normal life .
that's comforting? .
it's safe for benny .
i'm in .
we'd better watch out .
raymond tooley , creator oflife extension .
the bookk is life ..
the sequel .
where are you going? .
i left my number on your fridge .
come here .
i want to tell you a secret .
i meant that to be your forehead .
thank you for the inspiration .
i will now attempt to run my company showing compassion ... for the seething throng of my partners ... who root quietly for me to fail .
and for things you don't even know .
thankyou .
i'm gonna go to work .
i have a company to run .
pleasure delayer .
hey , handsome .
you're following me .
just a little bit .
i wanted to finish what we were talking about .
and? .
how did it go with our moth girl? .
she turn into a butterfly foryou? .
yes , she did .
she did .
i can tell by the way you were walking you didn't sleep with her .
let me guess .
you haven't slept with her because ... it's more fun when you can draw it out .
sex just isn't as good if a woman hasn't told her friends ... she'd never sleep with you .
right on the money, julie .
she must be exhausted from trying to be witty foryou all night .
hey, julie .
sorry .
it's okay .
you never seem to be there foryour friends until they've given up on you .
i'm not blowing you off .
i just
i wanna be alone for a little bit .
trust me .
i have a lot of things i have to take care of .
and ifwe're friends , which we are ... okay , then you'll understand that .
i'm sorry .
i got weird .
i missed an audition and ... it just made me feel bad you didn't invite me to your party .
you wanna make it up to me? .
i won't tell a soul .
would you do a story on me if i made a cd? .
sure i would .
do you like my music? .
it's vivid .
well , if i weren't me , i would buy a cd by me .
well , you know , ifyou can reach one person
wow .
what's happiness to you , david? .
what's happiness to me? .
what is happiness  'cause for me ... this is happiness just being with you .
there's one thing that bothers me .
why did you tell brian that i was your fuck buddy? .
i didn't tell him that .
i didn't say that .
when did you stop caring , david? .
caring about what? .
about the consequences of the promises that you've made .
promises? .
yeah , the promises .
i thought
get the fuck what are you talking about? .
do you understand how hard it is to pretend to be your buddy? .
david , i love you .
i fucking love you !
i fucking love you !
fuck !
whoa , whoa , whoa !
don't do this .
don't do this .
you fucked me four times the other night .
you've been inside me .
i swallowed your cum .
that means something .
slow down .
four times it means something .
four times .
stop the car .
twenty four hours a day , i live with this aching possibility ... that you might call me to do something .
let's go to your house .
i wanna see where you live .
just slow down .
i want you to stop the car !
don't you know when you sleep with someone ... your body makes a promise whether you do or not? .
tell me something , david .
do you believe in god? .
what are you doing? .
okay , i love you .
i love you .
don't do it !
you're amazing .
did you get to work all right? .
no , actually , i had a horrible dream .
you dreamed you'd never . see me again .
i left your apartment , i went downstairs to the car ... and my friend , the stalker , had followed me there .
yes .
and she wanted to talk to me .
and i remember i had this buzz , you know ... that buzz from you and me .
i think my mind was still on that terrible drawing of me .
but she was upset ... about i don't know .
i got in the car and ... she drove off a bridge ... and committed suicide with me in the car .
i thought you were going straight to work .
but i survived ... with my arm and my face ... reconstructed .
and what's worse ... is that i can't wake up .
and how was your house after the party? .
party? .
what party? .
the party .
remember? .
red dress , strappy shoes .
i spilled something on your shirt .
sweet and sour .
and the saddest girl to ever hold a martini .
my dreams are a crueljokke .
they taunt me .
even in my dreams , i'm an idiot ... who kknows he's about to wakke up to reality .
ifi could only avoid sleep .
but i can 't .
i try to tell myself what to dream .
i try to dream that i'm flying .
something free .
it never workks .
is that the only thing you dream? .
i don't i don't remember .
do you dream about the car accident? .
here's whatyou remember from a coma .
nothing .
what happened next? .
what really happened? .
what , didn'tyou read the file?
i was out for three and a halfweeks .
my face and my arm shattered and my jaw was broken in four places .
no surgery could be performed because ofthe coma .
you can't feel the darkness ... or numbness .
you can't even feel .
and then ...
i came back to life .
just like that dog .
benny .
you know , benny the dog .
benny .
benny the dog .
only my life was no longer normal .
there are blinding migraines now nerve damage .
why?
this is how big business operates random accidents ... a lifestyle mishap .
they are not coincidences .
how do you think airtight contracts are broken? .
these are power upheavals .
i'm from ohio .
we don't have power upheavals .
they are in the news every day right between the lines .
someone did this to me .
my father wrote about this in his book .
chapter one , page one ... paragraph one
what is the answer to 99 out of 1 00 questions? .
money .
david , lookk , i don't wanna worryyou .
i'm holding them off , but we got a situation here .
the bylaws of the board protect your 5 1 %% vote ... only ifyou're mentally acute .
i'm sorry that poor girl died ... but you've handed the board a real gift with your mishap .
they'd likke to declare you incapacitated .
but you're backk .
you sound good to me , so let's fight the fuckkers ... and have a full recovery .
and maybe you should let people see you , yeah?
the last time we were together . you were in a coma ... and you were very fucking rude to me .
you didn't say a word .
yes , well , the rumors of my death have been mildly exaggerated .
who could i trust?
the ants were takking over the anthill .
who could i trust?
the cranial structure was based on 30 pins ... and fastened by micro panels and bits of bone from the mandible .
it appears the cartilage graphs have maintained your cheek structure .
unfortunately , because you were in a coma
doctors .
theirpower is injargon , so you study up .
is that the procedure for all bilateral periorbital hematomas ... in a lefort three fracture of a comatose patient? .
in a lefort three? .
you do your best .
absolutely .
the potential for intracranial brain damage was too great .
beyond the cheek grafts , dr. pomeranz ... are the pins fastened with any kind of aluminum which could ionize ... and cause that pressure in my head? .
i'm ready for another operation .
we are working on processes .
but you're specifically not at the stage where we can experiment .
experiment .
use me .
the headaches will go away .
these are more than headaches .
these are like steel plates slicing through my every thought .
we're not cowboys .
we can't just wing it .
because i can't think straight most of the time .
we can increase your medication .
oh , yes , medication .
