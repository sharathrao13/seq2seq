we shall not cease from exploration ... and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started ... and know the place for the first time .

man ... probably the most mysterious species on our planet .
a mystery of unanswered questions .
who are we?
where do we come from?
where are we going?
how do we know what we think we know?
why do we believe anything at all?
countless questions in search of an answer ... an answer that will give rise to a new question ... and the next answer will give rise to the next question and so on .
but , in the end , isn't it always the same question?
and always the same answer?
the ball is round .
the game lasts 90 minutes .
that's a fact .
everything else is pure theory .
here we go !

manni?
lola .
what's up?
where are you?
where were you , damn it?
i got there too late .
but why today?
you're always on time !
my moped got ripped off .
it doesn't matter .
yes , it matters !
what's wrong?
it wasn't my fault , manni .
i went to get some cigarettes .
i can't believe how fast that guy was .
there was nothing i could do .
he was gone before i got outside .
i even took a taxi .
that dumbass drove east .
they got a grunewald st. there too .
when i noticed , it was too late .
it just didn't occur to me .
i was so screwed up because of our moped .
doesn't matter .
and when i got there , you were gone .
it doesn't matter now anyway .
i'm done for .
but why?
help me , lola !
i don't know what to do .
you weren't there , and i messed it up .
i blew it .
i'm such a jerk !
just calm down .
now what happened?
just tell me what happened , okay?
lola , he's gonna kill me .
i'm gonna die .
stop it !
you're scaring me .
what's up?
did you get caught?
no , but that would've been something .
everything went really great .
we drove the cars there , and those guys came .
they paid , and that was it .
easy as pie .
i got waved across the border , and then they dropped me off out there .
then i went to see that cyclops , and he was finished in no time .
and everything was on time , except for you .
you weren't there .
then what?
nothing .
not even a phone booth .
i couldn't even call a taxi , so i walked to the subway station .
on the train , there was this bum ... who somehow fell down , and suddenly these inspectors showed up .
and i got out like always an old reflex .
the bag !
the bag .
the bag !
i'm such a fucking amateur !
a dumbass !
this could only happen to me ! lf you'd picked me up , it wouldn't have happened .
i was so out of it .
you're always on time otherwise !
didn't you call the next station?
sure .
but it was too late .
the fucking bag was already gone .
and i know who has it .
that bum !
that plastic bag freak !
he's on a plane to florida or hawaii ... or canada or hong kong or bermuda or whatever .
what about ronnie?
he'll kill me .
you gotta tell him .
forget it !
why?
he won't believe a single word .
i kept a carton of cigarettes once .
he noticed right away .
he doesn't believe anybody .
the jobs with those mercs was a kind of test ... to see if he could trust me .
how much was there , in the bag?
100, 000 .
what?
100, 000 .
a test .
oh , shit !
see !
i knew you wouldn't come up with any idea .
i always said someday you wouldn't know what to do .
not when you die , sooner !
you said , " love can do everything .
so find 100, 000 marks in 20 minutes .
20 minutes?
at 12 : 00 by the water tower around the corner , ronnie said .
in 20 minutes .
run away , manni !
no .
why not?
nobody escapes ronnie .
i'll go with you .
when ronnie gets here in 20 minutes , i'll be a goner .
stop it , manni !
what for?
you can't get me 100 grand either !
he'll rub me out , and all that's left of me will be 100, 000 ashes ... floating down the spree to the north sea and no more manni !
you can't do a thing !
shut up !
listen .
wait for me .
i'll help you .
stay put .
i'll be there in 20 minutes .
okay?
gonna pawn all your jewelry?
where are you?
in a phone booth , downtown , in front of the spirale bar .
okay , stay where you are .
i promise i'll come up with something .
in 20 minutes , okay?
what the hell .
i'll go over to the bolle and get that 100 grand .
cut it out !
ronnie said they make 200 grand a day , so they must have 100 grand by noon .
you're nuts !
don't do a thing !
just stay in the damned booth !
i'm coming .
that's it .
i'll rob the store .
are you cracked?
don't do a thing !
stay put !
i'm coming .
then what?
i'll think of something !
in 20 minutes i'll be dead unless i steal the money !
no , wait !
what for?
i'll get the money somehow .
i'm going in there at 12 : 00 , if you aren't here .
okay !
who?
who?
dad !
lola , are you going shopping?
i need shampoo .
of course , i knew that sagittarius was your ascendant .
sure , the more i think about it , i don't know .
yeah , but you're married too .
hey !
get your eyes open !
you bitch .
and then
it's worst at night .
i wake up and can't fall asleep again .
and then i'm afraid .
me !
afraid of the dark .
i've never been afraid of the dark .
i've never been afraid before .
but i think about us ...
and i just think it'll keep going on like this .
and you wouldn't dare
and then i ask myself what i'm doing here .
how long will this go on?
the secrecy , all this damned lying?
should i grow old , waiting for a man who won't stand by me?
hey !
you need a bike?
50 marks , as good as new .
no .
and then
hey , man , i know that !
it's not my fault it's so much money !
500?

do you love me?
why are you asking now?
do you love me?
yes , i do , damn it !

lola .
what would you do if i died?
i wouldn't let you die .
yeah , well ... what if i were fatally ill?
i'd find a way .
what if i were in a coma , and the doc said , " one more day "?
i'd throw you into the ocean shock therapy .
what if i were dead anyway?
what do you want to hear?
come on .
tell me .
i'd go to the lsle of rueueuegen and cast your ashes to the wind .
and then?
i don't know .
it's a stupid question .
i know what you'd do .
you'd forget me .
no !
sure you would .
what else could you do?
sure , you'd mourn for a few weeks .
not a bad idea .
and everybody's real compassionate ... and everything's so incredibly sad , and everyone feels sorry for you .
you can show everyone how strong you are .
what a great woman , " they'll say .
she really pulls herself together instead of crying all day .
and all at once this really nice guy with green eyes shows up .
and he's super sensitive , listens to you all day .
and you can talk his ear off .
and you can tell him how tough things are for you ... and that you have to look after yourself and don't know what" s gonna happen ... and blah , blah , blah .
then you'd hop onto his lap and cross me off your list .
that's how it goes .
manni .
what?
you haven't died yet .
no?
lola , are you going shopping?
i need shampoo .
of course , i knew that sagittarius was your ascendant .
sure , the more i think about it , i don't know .
