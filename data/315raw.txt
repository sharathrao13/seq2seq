you were working for naruto .
don't you recognise us?
of the naruto family?
i am the daughter !
what do you want again?
we've paid for this month !
you haven't paid for today .
now you 're gonna pay each time we come by .
we wont be able to survive .
dont protest !
shut up and pay .
things were really bad with the funahatsi gang .
ginjo makes our life real hell !
damn you !
unbelievable spectacle !
i guide a blind masseur who carries my vegetable .
i wish i could see that !
you did a big favour for me .
drink some tea .
it's hot .
thanks .
without your help ... ... i couldn't bring them home .
where are you sleeping tonight?
it will be the first time that you come .
you're welcome to stay .
i live alone .
don't get any ideas .
i don't even think about it .
is it too strong?
no , it's just as it should be .
i can't think that our town is doomed .
ginjo and oggi are fine together .
they do what they want with us .
really?
you have such punks?
they terrify the farmers . and the town people .
they demand money for protection every day .
if it keeps going like this ... ... the more we work , the poorer we get .
you pay for protection each day?
we didnt use to .
we were paying each month .
big difference .
each month , each day .
exactly .
are you alright ;
we'll stay here for a while .
i will work again as a bodyguard .
don't you worry about me .
don't do that job for me .
one day i'll become a clerk again .
stop worrying .
you need some rest .
eh , old man !
where is grandfather ;
he's sick today .
he won't come .
you make him work too much .
i'm sorry .
you must take care of him more .
sake is awful , as always .
can't get any better .
same old story for 10 years !
can you give it to that guy?
i'm not your clerk !
what a nerve !
can't you take the by yourself?
drink at the bench !
w w welcome .
leave the " welcomes " .
where is this month's money?
please , give me some time .
what a joke !
we never wait !
i'll find the money .
say hello to your boss .
your sake sucks !
shut up !
what do you want?
send a message to your boss .
capable ronln looks for bodyguard job .
samurai ...
it's late .
ginjo boss probably won't come .
samurai , you're the one that seeks for a master to protect?
as a bodyguard?
show me what you can do .
well ..
not the rope .
look at your leg .
masseur , i'm off to the fields .
tell me, lady ...
can i do something to help?
thank you for offering your help ... ... but i cannot ask from a blind man to cut the woods .
don't you care about it .
you get some rest .
my dear ...
you came back late last night .
anything happened?
i found a good job .
as a bodyguard again?
i beg you , don't do it for me .
i beg you , stop doing this kind of jobs .
don't be a fool .
with the money you may get well .
tell me ...
you hired that ronln?
yes .
we have 2 problems to solve .
we must clean ijutsu and funahatsi .
after that the town will be yours , boss .
try not to be very hard .
yes .
don't you worry .
really ...
do you have any news on the heihatsi murder?
some rumours .
it is said that he was killed by a geisa .
that's what we know for now .
a bit more , masseur?
no , thank you .
i've had enough .
thanks again .
my lady , while i was cutting woods ... ... someone was running round the house .
what was he?
neighbour's son .
he's crazy with a certificate .
don't you pay to him .
he imagines that he's a samurai .
he runs like that all day .
samurai !
so ...
i'll be out for a while .
for work?
not exactly .
for this .
what?
you gamble?
better stay away from that .
my nephew is addicted to gambling .
he refuses to work , he gambles all day .
what can i say ...
he's lost from the face of the earth .
for me , it's a pleasure .
some pleasures can be very dangerous .
what do u think?
this sword cost me a fortune .
yes , mr. oggi , a wonderful sword .
i will give it back to lord sakai .
he will be very please to do work with us .
sure .
i'd say that you test it on the first beggar that comes by .
who?
me?
yes , you !
thanx you , master , but you better do it .
no way !
i'm not makin my kimono dirty !
you do it !
why don't you take a ronin?
you fool !
hire a ronin to test a sword?
do as i say !
but ...
someone's coming !

hatori genosouke .
i must kill you to regain my honur .
grab your sword !
kill me if you want .
i never ... ... owned a sword .
where do you find honour ... .. in killing a crippled man like me?
the art of battle is not the walking stick !
a real samurai uses his sword !
he's half dead .
no point in killing him .

why you're in such a rush?
shut up !
i wanted to see you .

i'll try with my eyes closed .
like him .
how does he do that by only hearing?
i am so unlucky !
one got away !
that's the problem .
odd .
even .
i think i got it .
my senses work better with my eyes closed .
good !
sinkitsi !
you're sitting with your eyes closed .
won't you bet?
i 'm listening .

you're sitting here and listen?
i have the right to hear .
you were asking for it .

this dump needs customers .

masseur ...

ah !
girls , this way !
quickly !
that oggi guy is horrible !
i hit him and we left when the customer went to take osei .
we had troubles in ginjo store .
but the masseur had put everybody to the ground .
it was unbelievable .
who are you , anyway?
if we stay here , they'll find us shortly .
lets go to my aunt's .
not possible .
ginjo's men are all over the place .
that's true .
i have an idea .
okinu , you got any make up?
of course .
masseur , come here .
don't move .
what is it?
i paint eyes .
for me?
open !
who's that this kind of hour?
who's that?
your nephew , sinkitsi .
he probaly lost everything again .
come in .
who are these guys?
watch out , masseur . masseur !
yes, its me .
you are useless !
what happened to the bodyguard?
everything was over when he came .
the masseur was already gone .
who's that masseur?
don't really know .
a masseur .
that punk , sinkitsi , was with him .
he often goes the club .
it wouldn't be hard to track him .
we'll get the masseur too .
firstly we must make the funahatsi gang extinct .
don't you say ...
we were suddenly going from town to town .
cheating men and robbing them .
ten years?
these punks must live differently now .
hold on .
wasn't oggi here ten years ago?
right .
indeed , that oggi ...
something's not right about him .
i saw his arm .
he has a snake tattoo .
one moment ...
the names u just told ...
you mentioned someone named kutsinawa?
yes , right .
kutsinawa means " rotten rope " .
maybe it means snake .
right ;
masseur !
don't look at me with these eyes !
i've heard about last night .
a masseur ruined your store .
yes .
we runned with the bodyguard .
but we were late .
oggi ...
who were those ladies?
lord sakai tried to take one .
but the other one hit me hard .
the way i saw them acting ... ... i am sure they are not real geisas .
listen ...
learn anything you can about that masseur and the geisas .
we're playing .
even .
odd .
i won .
this is my home .
go !
go away !
you're still eating?
i told you to clean up !
young seitaro , master wants to see you .
you , clean up this mess !
come with me , seitaro .
you are so lovely ! from now on you will be my boy .
if you do what i say ... ... your sister and you are welcome to live here .
you want to live here?
i'll buy you some beautiful kimonos .
what are you doing there?
stay away from the master's room !
no !
sir ...
you want to spent some time with me?
osei ...
time for practise .
sister ...
what's wrong?
nothing .
are you ok?
aunt , you have an umbrella?
over there .
i'm going to see what's happening downtown .
thank you .
grandfather , where is the old man today?
he had something to take care of .
that dull man?
why you're working in this dump?
don't you have any family?
exactly .
he picked me from the streets and offered my a job .
i was treated good .
i'm thankful for what he has done for me .
it's better begging than working in here !
if you sit outside in the ground , you'll earn more for sure .
5 plus 1 , even .
new game .
any ojections?
what are you doing here , bastards?
pay , if you wanna play .
watch out .
we were here first .
you're looking for trouble , bastard?
you're looking for trouble?
ginjo wants to compete .
stay back .
oh my god !
hold on ...
it's over .
that masseur ...
do u think he's zatoichi?
and that geisas ... .. must be from the naruto family .
naruto's taking down ...
when did this happen?
ten years ago .
i see .
if the kids survive , they must be grownups now .
i wonder ...
that bodyguard ... ... is he capable of winning versus zatoichi?
where is oggi?
boss ginjo himself !
i'm glad you came !
this way please .
i've heard your business goes well .
i told you not to come here . don't worry .
funahatsis are past .
we're in charge now .
the only thing left is to fill our pockets .
clean up in here !
great news !
funahatsi gang is extincted .
ginjo gang and the bodyguard slaughtered them all .
that ginjo guy pays for that tremendous bodyguard !
masseur , you better don't go to the town .
sinkitsi , that bodyguard is really so strong?
he's unbelievable .
if we had to face each other at night , who would be the winner?
if it was so dark , noone would see a thing .
the winner would be probably you .
you think it's funny?
let's see you now .
i'll train you .
come !
i'll teach you the art of battle .
concentrate .
we start .
attack from all sides .
not all at the same time !
let's try again .
for safety , let's plan the moves .
listen to me .
me first ...
like that ...
you hit here .
then ... ... you !
and then , you .
good .
let's try .
you see?
you see what you can do?
faster now .
good .
that's it !
not like that !
it hurts , you fool !
end of lesson .
you jerks !
what are you doing
you fool !
go home !
i'll have a bath .
me too .
no !
men first .
i'm a man myself !
masseur ...
i'm thinkin of paying a visit to oggi , again .
i have to know if he was one of the thiefs .
water is cold .
boil it better !
don't get on my nervers !
ain't it too much already you bathing yourself at daylight !
you're useless !
it isnt good cold .
please , boil it a bit more .
that's what i'm doing !
i confess it's unbelievable .
you really look like a woman .
make up makes men more beautiful?
not all .
depends on the face .
welcome .
we wanna ask sorry from mr. oggi .
he paid us to dance for him and we treated him disrespectful .
really?
can you tell him we said sorry?
sit down .
oggi drinks too much .
he probably has already forgotten abou it .
don't you worry .
i hope you're right .
we haven't seen you lately .
where do you live?
at ms. ume's house .
is there a masseur living with you?
are you alright , grandfather?
throw 'em out .
drink something .
thank you .
oggi and ginjo are friends now .
they are preparing something .
but their job has nothing to do with you .
one more?
not yet .
i'm off to oggi's .
i'll be late .
you wait here .
oggi says he's not angry at all .
he likes you and wants to see you both .
thank you very much .
thank you for the sake .
good luck .
where are the others?
they're off to the city .
what are you doing over there?
are you mad?
i wanna be beautiful , like osei .
what are you craving for !
what's all this fuss?
you're back , silly kid?
where is the masseur?
who are you?
we want the masseur .
he's not here .
you cannot hide him from us .
but he's not here .
we'll burn down the house and he will appear .
burn it !
stop !
aunt ume !
we're in trouble !
the house is on fire !
wake up !
we're in trouble !
come on !
quickly !
who are these people?
sinkitsi !
damn !
very beautiful woman .
woman?
things are not always what they seem too be , inosouke .
don't use that old name .
the walls have ears here .
my name is ginjo now .
what are you looking at?
keep dancing .
we know it all .
you're naruto's kids .
masseur !
girls , go now .
call the bodyguard .
inosouke , where are you heading at?
where is the bodyguard?
at his home .
call him now !
give me the sword !
on top of mama turtle goes the baby turtle .
on top of baby turtle goes the baby baby turtle .
on top of baby turtle goes the baby baby baby turtle .
mama turtle goes down ... ... baby turtle goes down , baby baby turtle goes down , baby baby baby turtle goes down too .
all the thiefs are dead .
except boss kutsinawa .
he must be really old now .
he'll be dead shortly anyway .
don't think about him .
you better think about your future .
you can stay here .
you can become a man again .
i'm fine as i am now .
where is the masseur?
he must be somewhere around here .
but the party starts today .
you found me .
how did you know?
bitch .
you may change as much as u want ... ... this awful smell will always stay the same .
stop bullshitting , blind man !
i proudly accept that i am boss kutsinawa .
a blind man like yourself ... ... will not slaughter me easily !
what the hell !
you're not blind?
not at all .
then why do you pretend to be blind?
cause blind men can sense the world better .
i knew you could see !
i knew it from the first time you came here .
you killed my men .
and torakitsi
you killed the tavern man ...
it was a kid from the streets .
i picked him up many years ago .
i taught him the business so he could be my successor .
all my gang is gone ... ... from a wandering masseur like yourself .
how did you know that i was the real boss kutsinawa?
from the time you threw my walking stick , to see the sword .
your the worst gangster of them all .
really?
i'm like a cripple now .
my retirement time has arrived .
but i lived a full life .
i regret for nothing .
come on , kill me !
you don't deserve death .
finish your life as blind man !
even with my eyes wide open ... ... i can't see anything !
