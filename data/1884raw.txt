excuse me , but aren't you sarah morton?
it is you .
i recognize you .
look , i'm reading your latest novel .
i love it .
i'm a big fan of inspector dorwell .
i've read all your books
you must have mistaken me with someone else .
i'm not the person you think i am .
excuse me .
**** [ rock ]
excuse me .
good morning .
what would you like?
whiskey , please .
ice?
yes .
yeah . and after that in all the directories .
and we will renew . most definitely . that shouldn't be a problem .
just a minute .
hello , sarah .
how are you?
could be better .
is john in?
yes , but he's in a meeting .
who with?
terry long .
who?
uh, just
yeah .
i'm in the process of drawing up the contract now and it should be with you shortly .
yeah , i'm absolutely sure .
now , you're on what's called " a roll .
you must keep the momentum going .
take a short holiday , but nothing too long . sarah .
um , let me introduce you . sarah morton , terry long .
terry long , sarah morton .
i'm so pleased to meet you . my mother adores you . she's read all your dorwell books .
right .
well , terry , always a pleasure .
we'll speak very soon .
and congratulations again on that award .
i'm sure it's the first of many .
oh , geez, john .
very nice to have met you .
and do hurry . my mother's impatiently awaiting the arrival of the newest inspector dorwell book .
so what award did that little shit get?
the manchester book critics .
hardly the booker prize , i know , but it's not bad for a first novel .
the " little shit , " as you call him , has talent .
i just hope he sells .
i trust you taught him your favorite motto .
and what motto's that?
you know damn well .
you drilled it into me 20 years ago .
awards are like hemorrhoids . sooner or later every asshole gets one .
did i say that?
my god , you're jealous , aren't you?
you don't look after me anymore .
j ust because i g ive a little fl ed g lin g some encoura g ement does not mean that i am ne g lectin g you .
besides , you've never had any problems finding inspiration for the dorwell series .
you write with such remarkable ease i wonder you need me at all .
okay , sarah , what's the matter?
c an't be money .
you're rollin g in it .
it's incredible .
the only thing you can find to talk about to me is money .
i don't g ive a damn about money ... or success !
i just want to find  an inspiring plot .
n o .
you don't understand .
it's it's got nothing to do with inspiration .
i'm i'm fed up with murders ... and investi g ations .
why don't you confound your critics and write something completely different?
put dorwell on the shelf , as it were .
you didn't like the last one , did you?
i knew it !
and you haven't had the balls to tell me .
that's simply not true .
you know very well i've loved the dorwell series right from the beginning .
as well you might ... considering the money they make you .
do you like france?
i like frogs 'legs .
s o what? my house .
why don't you go there for a while , hmm?
breathe some fresh air .
it's free , it's out of season , the weather's glorious .
there's a swimming pool .
would you come and visit me?
well .
i have g ot my dau g hter .
b ut maybe i 'll come f or a weekend .
are you marcel?
yes .
hello , i'm sarah morton .
how was your trip?
very nice . may i carry this?
it's on wheels .
i'll take the small one .
thank you . my car is just outside .
okay .
the bedrooms and bath are upstairs , the kitchen's on the left .
i'll let you take a look around .
i turned on the hot water and gas .
if you need anything , you've got my number?
yes, john gave it to me .
good .
to go to the village , you can take the footpath i showed you ... or use the moped in the garage .
the keys are in the ignition .
thank you , marcel .
good bye .
good bye , madame .
enjoy your rest .
b on j our .
b on j our .
what can i get for you?
um  an aperitif?
no .
uh , maybe something lighter?
how about a panach e?
no . just a cup of tea .

the weather's gorgeous .
how is the weather in london?
doesn't stop raining .
are you all right?
yes , i'm okay .
have you met anyone?
no , i haven't seen anyone .
you shouldn't stay by yourself .
try to get out .
father .
yeah [ muttering ]
look , father , if there's a problem of any kind , ask mrs . smith for help .
all right?
i don't need anyone's help .
yes .
you take care now .
you too .
all right .
bye bye .
good bye .
hello?
sarah !
john , how are you?
i'm very well .
i should be asking you that question .
so , tell me , how's everything going , darling?
did marcel come and fetch you?
yes , but listen .
i have just one thing to say to you , and that's thank you .
you were right , as usual .
your house is a little piece of paradise .
and i've already begun working .
hmm? so soon?
yes .
the idea kept running through my mind while i was on the train .
you know , one of those stupid things that just latch on and won't let go .
really?
i don't know where it's heading , but so , what's dorwell up to now?
well , i'm not ready to talk about it right now .
all right .
but i think it might be quite funny .
anyway , i'm going to wait until i'm sure .
well , that's marvelous .
well , i'm glad you're happy .
have you been out and about yet?
no .
i'm just enjoying the peace and quiet here .
good .
yeah . so , when are you thinking of coming?
um , i don't know .
i'm not sure .
it it depends on the work , you know .
um , look , i'm sorry , sweetheart .
i've got another call coming through .
now , you take care , and call me when you're ready to read me something , all right?
right .
fine .
good bye, john .
you scared me !
who are you?
what are you doing in my house?
your house?
this is my house !
i should be asking you .
are you e n g lish?
that's correct .
i'm sarah morton .
i'm a writer .
and my publisher, john bosload , is letting me this house .
ah . so you're daddy's latest conquest .
you're his daughter? so what?
didn't he warn you?
no , he didn't tell me you'd be coming .
i'm not surprised .
is he here?
n o .
i 'm here on my own . and i 'm here to work .
m aybe he'll come and visit .
i'm glad he's not here .
are you going to be staying long?
i don't know .
i don't have much work these days . so , which bedroom did you take?
the one upstairs overlooking the pool .
of course .
that's the best one .
well , i'm gonna unpack .
sorry .
hello .
leave your name , number and any message you might have ... and i'll get right back to you .
bastard !
you could have told me your daughter was coming to your bloody house .
how do you expect me to work now?
it's sarah .
good bye .
i couldn't get through to london .
i s there an yt hin g to eat?
yes .
go and look for it in the kitchen .
personally , i'm gonna go back to bed .
i have to work early in the morning .
fine .
good night . sarah , right?
right .
i'm julie .
you're not too hot?
sorry .
i woke you up .
no .
i was just dozing .
you must be working too hard .
you should have a swim in the pool .
the water's cold .
it'll wake you up .
well , thank you for your advice , but i absolutely loathe swimming pools .
yeah , i know what you mean .
i prefer the sea too .
the ocean .
the crashing waves . the f eelin g o f dan g er . that you could lose f ootin g at any time and be swept away .
pools are boring .
there's no excitement , no no feeling of infinity .
i t's j ust a bi g bathtub .
it's more like a cesspool of living bacteria .
oh , that?
no , it's just a bit of dirt and leaves .
s o . what are you writin g?
a romance novel?
god , no .
i write crime fiction .
o h . yeah . that's how he makes his money .
and that's how he can afford to buy a beautiful house in france for his daughter to enjoy .
what about you?
are your books selling well?
i can't complain .
what is this one about? murders and a police investigation .
in the lub e ron with rich english tourists .
listen , if you don't mind , i do have work to do .
okay .
i leave you alone , miss marple .
i need to make some phone calls an yw ay .
he was at the macumba?
no way !
with jean pierre?
yeah , right .
what a pervert !
you're gross !
he came back?
i don't know .
going shopping?
no , i'm going to have lunch in the village .
ah , good idea .
by the way , i spoke to marcel .
he's coming very soon for the pool .
his english bitch has a broomstick up her butt .
may i have the bill?
please .
yes .
e n g lish ]
h ello?
d on't wor ry about it .
i'm not going to bother her .
anyway , it's a big house .
did you ring mom?
i'm telling you , she's still waiting , so hurry up .
yes , c'est c a .
c iao .
it's your publisher .
john?
hello?
john?
he hung up .
hello?
hello , this is sarah morton .
could i speak tojohn , please?
he's gone out .
oh .
really?
well , could you ask him to call me back in france?
okay then .
yes , thank you .
good bye .
he scolded me .
he told me not to bother you .
he said i should leave you alone so you could work .
listen, julie .
i'm going to be frank with you .
i need peace and quiet to concentrate .
and since we share the same living space ,
i must ask you just to go about your business without getting in the way of mine , hmm?
i mean , this house is certainly big enough for the two of us . so , please make an effort .
i was only trying to be polite and make friends .
but if you prefer i don't i don't prefer anything !
i just want to work on my book in peace .
fine .
that's too bad , though , because i just bought loads of nice food .
i guess i have to eat my foie gras all alone .
c a va?
we're almost there .
i'm wasted .
are you okay?
where are we? my house .
you live here?
yeah , i swear !

can't you turn the music up?
no , the old bag's sleeping upstairs .

good morning .

i made some coffee , if you like .

i hope we weren't too loud?
i don't speak french .
i can't understand a word .

get up !
i've got to get to work .
just a quickie .
i'd love to , but i've really got to go .
and there's that woman .
you saw her?
yeah , she's outside . she's a foreigner?
yes .
english .
not bad looking . so fuck her , if you like old maids !
i was just kidding .

want me to drive you?
it's not far . see you later .
thanks .
it was nice .
call me sometime .
no problem .
c iao .
is everything all right?
yes .
are you from around here?
yes , lacoste .
have you been there?
no .
the marquis de sade's castle is there .
oh , right .
i've heard about it .
it's practically in ruins now , isn't it?
you can say that again .
but there's a nice panoramic view of the lub e ron .
it's beautiful .
i'll let you finish .
oh , it's you .
your bedroom's not big enough for you?
yes , it is , but he snores like a pig .
i couldn't get to sleep .
expecting another one?
bonjour .
i've come for the pool .
julie called .
hi , marcel .
hello .
how are you?
not bad .
you're back already?
i was sick of work .
i felt like a rest .
this is sarah , a friend of my father's .
yes , we've met .
are you cleaning the pool today?
isn't that what you wanted, julie? sarah wants to swim , but it's too dirty for her .
b on j our .
where's the girl?
what girl?
i forget her name .
the little blonde .
julie , maybe?
that's it . julie , right .
check out in the backyard by the pool .
i believe she's getting some air .
thanks , madame .
bernard , this is marcel .
he's my dad . stop joking .
come on , marcel !
going out?
yes .
d o i have to ask f or your permission?
well , it would be nice if you didn't make any noise when you came home .
yes , mother .
i pity your mother .
you pity her?
why?
well , i imagine having a daughter who comes home with a different man every night must be difficult for a mother .
well , you imagine wrong .
you know what?
you're just a frustrated english woman ... who writes about dirty things but never does them .
you can shove your uptight morals up your ass .
**** [ f lute p layin g o n t v ]
i was worried when you didn't come home .
are you gonna tell my daddy?
yes , maybe i will .
then why don't you?
he would love it .
i'm not so sure about that .
how can you be so naive?
he's the king of orgies .
didn't you know?
julie?
yes?
would you like to go out to dinner tonight?
s hall we g o?
are you ready?
yes , i'm coming .
you're working , as usual .
o h .
i was j ust rereadin g an old piece .
this is my underwear .
what's it doing here?
i found it in the garden near the pool .
where shall we go?
not too far .
i'm exhausted .
i see the waiter isn't here tonight .
franck? maybe .
i don't know his name .
it's franck , a boy from lacoste .
during the off season he only works days .
i see .
do you know him well?
a little .
i see him around sometimes .
you seem to know just about everyone here .
well , of course .
i've spent my whole childhood here .
but not with john?
no .
he abandoned us , my mother and i.
he just came here for the summer on holiday .
do you resent him for that?
no , not really .
he lives his life , i live mine .
what about your mother , is she french?
yeah .
where does she live?
in nice .
why are you so interested now?
oh .
oh , i don't know .
well , maybe you and i got off to a bad start .
i was angry with you well , actually , i was angry atjohn ... for not really telling me about you or her .
he's the one you're interested in .
when someone keeps an entire part of their life secret from you , it's fascinating and frightening .
i don't deny that i want to know more .
but don't count on me to tell you any secrets .
if you wanna know something , you should askjohn .
i'm not asking anyone anything .
yeah , sure .
you may pretend you don't care , but i can see you're hoping i tell you some things about my father .
actually , i'm more interested in your mother .
why don't you live with her in nice?
that's a long story .
shall we order?
yes .
s 'll vous plait .
i was 1 3 the first time .
i haven't stopped since .
i fell in love once .
we were 1 6 .
it was summertime .
he was ... handsome , romantic , coming from paris .
his name was christian .
i was crazy about him .
i wanted him to take me , but i was too fast for him .
he was a baby .
he didn't know how to do those things yet .
he was terrible .
he came on me after two seconds .
so i dumped him .
he wrote to me for a year , but i never wrote back .
i remember once in the f o rt we built in the f orest . he asked me to mar ry him .
i t's stupid .
i know . we were j ust kids . but it made me c ry .
i t was the first time anyone [ i nhales s harply ]
i 'm sor ry .
i 'm borin g you with my stories .
no .
no , go on .
i'm enjoying it .
go on?
with what?
what happened to your eye?
it's nothing . some asshole tried to hit me , but i fought back .
he was bleeding like a pig .
nobody better mess with me , because if they do , i'll mess with them back .
i suppose you don't want any?
why not?
never judge a book by its cover .
i've done my share of smoking .
and fucking?
yes .
i was around in swinging london .
yeah . my mom already told me about it .
what did she tell you?
how she metjohn .
how she seduced him .
how is your book coming?
it's coming .
although , i must say , it is quite strange ... to be writing a typically english story set in london ... while i'm here in this house in such beautiful weather . my mom wrote a book too , but it was never published .
he told her it was awful , so she burned it .
well , that's terrible .
did you read it?
yeah .
i liked it .
it was a bit sentimental , kind of a harlequin romance , but charming .
what was it about exactly?
about her and my f ather .
i t was a love sto ry with a happy endin g .
but what he wants is blood , sex and money .
that's what you give to him , isn't it?
yes .
but i like all that too .
did your mother live in this house?
s ometimes . with my f ather . especially in the summe rt ime .
b ut once they were truly separated . she didn't want to come back anymore .
s he went to live in n ice .
an yw ay . it's really his house .
d id she want him to come and live with her in f rance?
yeah .
s he wanted him to leave his wi f e and f amily in l ondon f or her .
b ut j ohn would never do that .
m y mother was terri f i e d to be alone here .
n ot me .
i am like you .
julie?
julie , are you here?
good evening .
hello there .
i'd like you to meet a friend of mine who's come for a drink .
hello , madame .
i didn't know you were atjulie's .
i forgot to tell you , sarah's a writer friend of my father's .
you didn't tell me you write .
yeah , mysteries . so watch your back !
could you make us a drink , sarah?
i'll go get some weed in my room .
sit down , franck . make yourself at home .
whiskey?
yes .
thank you .
this time you're serving me .
got it .
what shall we drink to?
i don't know .
i know .
to sarah's book .
to sarah's book .
what's it about?
oh , i never discuss a book before it's finished .
how about the last one then?
a police investigation in scotland .
what was it called?
i don't know the french title .
in english it was d o rw ell wears a kilt .
what?
what's that mean?
d o rw ell wears a kilt .
that's too funny !
yeah , really , that's bizarre !

not surprising .
it's tiring to kill a man .
sarah?
sarah .
what?
thank you .
all ri g ht . that's done .
i'm going to bed now .
s arah? there's somethin g y ou f or g ot to burn .
what's that?
your book .
it could be used as evidence .
did you read it?
no , but i just can imagine .
well , stop imagining , huh?
get yourself to bed .
we got work to do tomorrow .
listen .
i've thought it over .
we have to carry on with our lives as if nothing has happened .
you should call marcel and ask him to come up this afternoon to do some work .
like cut the grass?
why not?
it's important for everything to appear normal ... as it was before .
another thing , did anyone see you with franck before the two of you came here?
no .
are you sure?
yeah .
i went to his house .
he lives in an isolated place outside lacoste .
and after , we came directly here in my car .
did anyone see you along the way?
i don't think so .
did he have any family?
no .
his parents are dead .
right .
are you going back to london?
not straightaway .
that would look suspicious .
why are you helping me , sarah?
well , why wouldn't i help you?
i don't know .
do you think they will arrest me?
no , not necessarily .
if you do exactly as i say , i don't think there'll be any problems .
and why should i believe you?
because you write about murders in your books?
absolutely .
marcel .
m arcel .
sarah .
oh .
it's you .
i came to say g ood bye .
i want to let you finish your book .
i'm going to saint tropez .

it's possibly for the best .
are you going to tell my father?
john?
i've got nothing to tell him .
you're right .

how did you get that scar on your stomach?
is that for your book?
yes .

yes , well .
i've read it .
i don't know what to say .
you didn't like it , did you?
i wouldn't say that , exactly .
oh , come on, john . stop beating around the bush .
give me the truth .
well , i don't understand what you're trying to say .
and i don't recognize you in it .
i thought that's what you wanted .
you wanted something more personal .
yes , i know , but i
i don't think writing about feelings is your strong suit . murders , investigations , that's your line of country .
i mean , this is far too subtle .
i t's too abstract .
where's the action?
where are the plot twists? so , what's your advice? shall i burn it?
