it says " look here . " and we'll match .
daddy will hate it .

she doesn't like it when i antagonize her father .
especially since he's recovering from a very delicate operation .
what?
they tried to remove the stick up his ass but they couldn't get it out .
i'm gonna go wait in the car .
where do you think you're going?
away from you .

okay , thanks .
and , you guys , thank you so much .
this was so sweet .
i'm sorry i can't invite everyone to the wedding ... but we kept the guest list really tiny .
actually , i wanted to elope , but evan's really close with his family .
so basically , anybody who's related to mr. wonderful ... people you probably don't even know , " hey , right this way .
but us , who you worked with for how many years?
no , i'm getting married , i'm not going to be a hooker anymore , fuck them .
em , shut up .
so , how did you two meet , you know , you and evan?
right , you weren't here yet , were you?
no .
actually , it was at the x ray machine at the reno airport .
i was going to san diego on my week off , and he was going home to detroit .
i told him i was a stewardess .
flight attendant .
and he still thinks that .
three weeks on , one week off .
company , girls .

another satisfied pedophile .
i'm so excited you picked me .
$32 .
keep the change .
thank you .
you want me to help you in?
i got it .
are you sure i don't know you?
you don't .
hi .
can i help you?
i don't know .
can you?
hi , dad .
hey , sweetie .
i thought you were bringing her home before lunch .
it's my fault .
i lost track of time .
for someone who gets paid by the hour , you'd think you'd be more attuned to that .
come here , you .
i will talk to you later .
you have fun at the party tomorrow .
wish elizabeth happy birthday for me .
i will .
love you .
love you more .
wait a sec .
go on inside .
yeah , the nails?
that was me , too .
what's next , a g string?
do you want to know the smartest thing i ever did?
not marry you .
i forgot .
i don't need it .
the fortune magazine said house painters are in the top two percentile of earnings .
were you always such a bitch or is this new?
it's child support .
just take it .
i'd just as soon not go to macy's , buy her a coat ... pay for it with the money you made giving some asshole a blowjob .
do you not understand that what i do i do for her?
please .
i want our kid to have every god damn thing i didn't have .
i want her to have a new coat every year ... and piano lessons , and i don't know , a fucking horse if she wants one .
here , baby girl , you go wherever you want .
you know what?
let her go to community college ... and have a mother who's a mother , not a prostitute .
you are such a clueless bastard .
nice car .
is it new?
who'd you say you're in this for?
cookies and milk .
all day sucker . " what's that?
guess .
so , what do you feel like?
maybe you could blow me?
and i could ... fuck you after .
okay .
is $150 ...
is that about right?
is that all you think i'm worth?
so that's velvet ...
knight , with a " k .
you know , i had a cat named velvet once .
lady , whose pussy we talking about , mine or yours?
do me a favor .
save that kind of language for the clients .
you don't like it so much , what're you doing being a madam anyways?
manager .
whatever .
the truth?
it was the best paying job i could find .
yeah .
same here .
$400 .
half and half . $400 for a blowjob and a straight lay?
yeah .
that's a lot .
not for me .
here you go .
thanks .
so you know what a " half and half " is?
i guess you've worked before .
not in nevada .
in la .
last couple of years .
time for a change of scenery , you know?
here's this all .
you people are strict here .
licenses , checkups every week .
man !
let me tell you how it goes here .
the girls are on for three weeks , working 10 to 12 hour shifts every day .
then they're off for a week .
sometimes , we have girls who just work weekends ... and the house gets half of everything you make .
sounds all right .
i'm sorry .
is it possible that we've met before?
because you look awfully familiar .
yo brooklyn , that tv show bunch of years back?
vonetta knight , of course .
you play the sister .
yep .
my son and i watch the reruns on nickelodeon .
let me ask you something .
that rashad?
played my little brother on the show .
how old you think he was when i was on it?
how old?
thirteen?
fourteen?
nineteen .
nineteen years old , almost twenty .
but his asshole daddylmanager wants everybody to think he's some kid .
so one day , me and rashad are getting on in the dressing room ... daddy walks in , old man just about has a stroke .
next week , the script comes out and my character's dead in a car wreck .
i got them the highest rating ever , those motherfuckers !
excuse me .
so why did you stop?
you were good .
'cause daddy goes round town ... telling everybody i'm some piece of garbage .
job ends and suddenly i can't get arrested ... except on hollywood boulevard , but that's another story .
anyhow , those charges didn't stick .
i'm sorry that happened to you .
yeah , well .
look , here's what .
end of every show ... we'd all come out and the audience would give us a standing ovation .
it didn't matter , every single week , standing " o.
and when i'm with a john and i do my sex thing , i watch him .
i watch him get hard .
his dick is standing straight up because of me .
so .
you got room for me?
you want this?
you don't?
i'm lucky to be getting away with flight attendant .
i don't think he'll buy lion tamer on top of that .
you going to tell him ever?
why would i?
it's who you are .
it's who i was .
you must have some on off switch somewhere that i never saw .
where's it , on your ass?
no , wait , i've seen your ass .
yeah , and so has half the population of nevada .
and i don't think my fianc needs to know that .
but aren't you gonna wonder how he would feel if he knew?
yeah , i'm going to wonder .
you know what else i'm going to do?
i'm gonna keep my big mouth shut .
the past is the past , tay ... and this is my future .
okay ... but if i fall in love again someday , god forbid ... and the guy gives me attitude 'cause this is how i make my living ... fuck that .
that's a deal breaker .
i better get in on this lineup .
you are going to make a beautiful bride .
come back and visit us once in a while , will you?
probably not .
you know where the plates are?
that one on the right .
thanks .
so mary let you stay?
yeah .
i'm velvet .
good for you .
so what do you think of this place?
everybody else seems nice .
bunch of jerks .
what?
i'm not here to make friends .
i'm here to make money .
figure another year or two , i got enough cash , i'm out of here .
what are you gonna do?
get out of this rat's ass of a city .
get a house somewhere .
a house house , not a whorehouse .
get a foster kid , maybe .
two more years .
three , at the most .
you do pretty good then?
i do fucking great .
stupid bitch , emily , with the tattoos , thinks her little pussy's made of gold .
i book twice as much as she does .
oh , and by the way , cupcake ... you want to keep yourself away from my regulars , you got it?
don't you worry .
anything that goes into you , i don't want going into me .
then we'll get along just fine .
you're here !
i know .
finally .
i can't believe it .
i know .
i missed you so much .
so you still want to marry me , or have you gotten over that silly idea?
you bet .
let's go get my bags .
wait .
isn't there anybody you need to say goodbye to?
any of the crew?
the other stewardesses?
no , all i want to do is get to the hotel and ...
that could work .
kim , get this .
in ancient greece , the only women allowed to own property were prostitutes .
probably the only ones who could afford to .
yeah , maybe .
what you got there?
that's what you read for fun?
you'll get used to it .
just don't play any trivia games with her .
or make bets .
i got to ask you .
who do i talk to about clean sheets?
franny takes care of all the laundry .
but don't let the guys under the sheets or you'll be changing them all day .
use one of those towels in your closet , trick towels .
that was your first john just now , wasn't it?
how'd that go?
guy tells me he wants to do it like a dog .
i figure he means doggy style .
he breaks out a collar , a leash , i end up scratching him behind the ears ... and rubbing him on his belly till he goes off .
what the hell is that?
you know , in la ... you get in the back of a dude's car , suck him off , and that's that .
i used to beat off my cousin's dog .
hello?
scrappy .
he was a show dog .
a jack russell terrier .
wouldn't that make him a " jack off " russell terrier?
one for the new girl .
my aunt and uncle wouldn't let him fuck , ever .
except with another show dog , like , once a year .
he was always so frustrated .
he told you that?
no , i could tell .
taylor , there's a customer asking for you .
he said bicycle jimmy sent him .
thanks .
later .
man , another crappy day in the desert .
and i always thought california weather was amazing .
this is like heaven .
no shit .
wait .
you need sunscreen .
here , let me .
you're not going to try and cop a feel , are you?
how's that?
i'm sorry my mother made such a big deal about you staying at the house .
she's old fashioned , is all .
she doesn't believe in sex before marriage .
i don't even think she believes in sex during marriage .
want me to tell her what she's missing?
wait a sec .
we have time .
my sister's flight doesn't get in for another hour .
probably be late , anyway .
what's wrong?
there's ... something we have to talk about .
oh , god .
what?
it's not bad .
i mean , it's bad , but it's not ...
nobody's dead or anything .
i got laid off .
when?
about two weeks ago .
the whole midsize line , they're not making them anymore .
sedans and station wagons .
just like that .
assholes .
oh , honey .
every time we talked on the phone , i wanted to tell you .
i hated lying when you'd ask me how work was .
but i thought it'd be better in person .
are you pissed?
no .
it's not your fault .
anyway , i was thinking , till i find something ... maybe you can transfer out here .
i don't think i could transfer that easy .
because things like that take a lot of time to come through .
shit .
could you get your old route back?
while i'm looking?
i don't know .
i'm sorry to dump this on you .
no , it's fine .
i'm gonna go take a shower .
you're not feeling like this changes everything , are you , hon?
no .
my friend jimmy says that ... you give the best head of anybody he's ever met .
tell him i said thanks for the referral .
yeah .
i don't suppose i could get you to swallow , could i?
i'd make it worth your while .
sorry .
you've got to keep the condom on the whole time .
i know .
but , damn !
i mean ... all day long , i'm in there and i'm marrying people and ...
that's good .
anyway , all day long i'm pronouncing them " man and wife , baby , man and wife .
and i just keep trying to guess ... is this one gonna let him come in her mouth?
or that one?
here .
i'll be right in .
okay .
my girlfriend hardly ever gives me head .
she never lets me get off in her mouth .
says it tastes funny .
what you can try for that is pineapple juice .
i read that it makes your jizz taste better .
yeah , but won't that sting?
honey , you drink it , you don't soak your dick in it .
so , the owner of this place?
he's some kind of slick , rich , white pimp wannabe?
what'd i say?
the owner is my uncle .
shit .
sorry .
don't worry about it .
but for the record , no , he isn't one of those .
his uncle is named david .
that's why he's the other david .
the boss is okay .
you got to keep booking or you're out , that's for sure .
but they take pretty good care of us .
other david takes especially good care of us .
hint , hint .
seven in the side pocket , baby .
it's sure shot .
there's no way those guys are partying .
but you know , when they're humping their pillows tonight ... they'll be picturing you and me .
am i right , austin?
guess so .
hey , austin , this is velvet .
she's new .
maybe you'll try her out soon .
how's it hanging?
good .
it's good .
he comes in every day , nurses one beer for hours ... then once every two weeks , on payday , he parties .
you can tell it's payday when his hair's clean .
good to know .
excuse me .
mary , are you kidding me?
i'm in the middle of something here .
your daughter's on the phone .
she's crying .
says it's urgent .
something about her dad won't let her go to a party .
shit .
give me 30 seconds .
okay .
where do you go to school?
colorado state .
same as my sister did .
she's the brains in our family .
your mother won't let me help her do anything .
you know , i was thinking about you the other afternoon .
i was watching one of those health channels on the cable ... and they did a whole show about jet lag .
you ever have any trouble with that , all that flying around?
it bothered me at first , yeah .
but you get used to it .
you must meet so many interesting people with job like that .
i did , yeah .
athletes .
actors .
a couple of politicians .
look what we got .
here , let me get that .
there's tuna salad , egg salad , and some turkey .
guy i work with , his daughter is a stewardess .
manny's kid .
i remember her .
tall , long black hair .
tramp .
nice , ma .
i'm only saying what's true .
the girl slept her way across the country .
maybe it was the jet lag .
we need more lemonade .
where's your brother?
he's upstairs , i think .
tommy .
we're eating .
come on down .
sorry .
i was just getting things set for later .
shayna , you don't mind , do you?
me and the guys kidnapping evan for the night?
no , who am i to get in the way of a good bachelor party?
just so you know , we're skipping the whole strip club thing .
i should hope so .
kidding me?
you could get a disease just looking at some of those skanks .
sorry , ma .
not that either of us would know about this firsthand .
thank goodness for small favors .
eat .
thanks , ma .
i'll see you both tomorrow .
see you tomorrow .
and get some sleep tonight .
that was a boatload of fun .
what?
oh , good .
i thought you'd gone into a coma there .
it's the day before her wedding .
she's just a little tense .
you are .
thank you .
why are you marrying me?
what?
why do you love me?
let me see .
because you're hot?
i'm kidding .
i mean , you are , but that's not ...
i have this uncle .
uncle lou , he's quite a character .
you'll meet him tomorrow .
whenever he talks about a woman he really likes ... he calls her a good girl .
that audrey hepburn , she's a good girl .
anyway , after that first weekend you and i spent together ...
i finally understand what you're talking about uncle lou .
i met a good girl .
i'm so glad chelsea made it .
elizabeth would have been crushed if she wasn't here .
i'm sorry we're so late .
there was a mix up with chelsea's dad .
so nice to meet you finally .
yeah , you , too .
what time do you want me to pick her up?
no , stay .
please .
i can't .
at least have a cup of coffee .
okay .
come on .
everybody , this is chelsea's mom .
sorry , i don't know your first name .
taylor .
we were beginning to think you didn't really exist .
this is me .
i'm gail , melody's mom .
hi .
that's inez and patty .
inez is brittany's mom , and patty's got the twins .
how's it going?
good .
found it .
hon , this is taylor .
nice to meet you .
nice to meet you , too .
i should get this out to the karaoke machine .
excuse me .
thanks .
can i ask you a question , taylor?
yeah .
i mean , it's none of my business and it's probably not even true ... but did i hear correctly that you work at the diamond ranch?
for god's sake .
no , it's okay .
that is where i work .
as a ...
as a what?
a prostitute?
what do you do , inez?
i teach yoga .
you charge by the hour?
yeah .
the more clients , the more money you make?
that's very cute .
i wasn't trying to be .
it's the same concept .
probably some of the same positions , now that i think about it .
would you excuse me , please?
apple doesn't fall far from the tree , apparently .
i'll say it again
i've got a 20 dollar goldpiece
that says there's nothing i can't do !
i can make a dress out of a feedbag and i can make a man out of you
'cause i'm a woman
w o m a n
it's nothing .
they're kids .
she probably doesn't even know what she's even singing about .
yeah .
feed the baby , grease the car and powder my face at the same time
listen ... thanks for not busting me back there .
i would never do that .
rory would die if she knew .
yep .
i can still come and see you , though , can't i?
i'll be back to pick up chelsea in about an hour .
woman
a w o m a n
i'll say it again
dude , come on .
i'm tying my shoe , give me a break .
what the fuck for?
it's gonna be off in , like , a minute .
go for it .
it'll put some hair on your chest .
what's to think about?
take the gorgeous one .
give me a minute .
it's a birthday present from me to him .
and you know what a good brother i am?
i'm not even banging one of them myself .
i only saved up enough money for him to .
very nice of you .
i'll take her .
jean jacket .
it's your dick .
all right , then , emily .
thank you , girls .
i'll be waiting at the bar , bro .
knock yourself out .
mary , your son's here .
really?
hi , sweetie .
what are you doing here?
is everything all right?
i don't know where my house key is .
i think i lost it at the park .
i'll go get mine .
be right back .
so ... what are you thinking you might like?
i don't want to do this .
are you not very experienced , scotty , is that it?
it's all right .
i'll teach you .
learn on me .
baby , are you a virgin?
no .
are you gay?
fuck you !
hey , any time you're ready .
i didn't hear a yes or a no .
yes .
you having a little chat with yourself?
yes , okay?
yes , i'm a fag .
there , i said it , you happy now?
so what's the deal , your brother doesn't know?
it's none of his business .
that's fair .
no , wait , i'll pay you for this , okay?
just let me stay in here till it's been long enough time .
what the hell .
it's not the worst lie i've ever been part of .
not by a long shot .
you do use condoms , right?
when you're with a guy?
yes .
every time?
yes .
just making sure .
okay , one of these .
and a t shirt , the black one .
and a couple of these .
that's $27 even .
can i get a beer?
yeah , sure .
thought i'd get the kid a couple of souvenirs .
not that he's ever gonna forget this , right?
that'll be $4 .
thanks , bud .
scotty's probably banging that chick pretty good by now .
probably .
diamond ranch .
yeah , hold just a sec .
austin , it's for you .
hello .
what?
jesus , what's with the sirens?
you want me to get you a beer?
you want me to put some music on?
i'm okay .
you play guitar?
i always meant to learn how .
i had a boyfriend in a band .
i used to go on tour .
sing backup sometimes .
cool .
i had this fantasy that somebody would discover me .
who's that babe in the back?
i guess when you're drunk out of your mind ... most of the time you're not such a hot investment .
i guess not .
i'm named for a song .
not really , but what i use for work .
how come?
because some of us don't use our real names .
anyhow , i picked emily .
it's from this record my sister would listen to when i was a kid .
i don't know that song .
emily
you're the natural snow
the unstudied sea
you're a cameo
keep going .
no .
that was pretty .
thanks .
my uncle , my mom's brother ... he produces shows at the hilton in reno .
they're always looking for singers .
i could give him your tape .
do you have one?
someplace .
listen , you don't have to do me any favors or anything .
i'm not going to rat you out to your brother .
that's not why i said it .
okay .
peter , wait .
god damn it , taylor , i knew it .
she's in there?
yes , she is .
let go .
wait , don't go and embarrass her in front of her friends .
she's not even supposed to be at that party .
i told her .
she talked back to you one time , big fucking deal .
don't you tell me how to raise my daughter .
whoa .
our daughter .
my daughter , three out of every four weeks .
or has that fact conveniently escaped your mind?
no .
look , i appreciate how you take care of her .
you appreciate it?
what am i , the baby sitter?
did i say that?
i was trying to teach her something .
and you just swooped right in .
regular goddamn mary poppins .
hey , pal , i'm not the baby sitter , either .
and what was so important that you couldn't let her go to a stupid party?
you want to know?
yeah , i want to know .
every day she gets more and more like you .
and that scares the shit out of me .
so you can go .
i'll wait for her out here .
i won't embarrass her .
i won't punish her .
go .
there you are .
you hiding back here?
yeah , kind of .
what's up?
i'm supposed to let you know that mister tits is here ... and he can't wait to see you .
his words , not mine .
lucky me .
but he does pay me a fortune .
and all i have to do is let him snort a little coke off my boobs .
hey , i don't need the details .
sorry .
sometimes i forget you're not one of the girls .
thanks .
you know what i mean .
hey , did you hear about austin?
no , what?
his house burned down , electrical fire .
he lost everything .
shit .
and at that moment my love juices exploded into her ...
and i let out a loud moan of complete and utter ecstasy .
and i have to say i'm pretty sure ...
she enjoyed it as much as i did .
every one of them writes that .
god bless them , if they only knew .
yetta , can i get a bowl of soup with some poison please?
rough day?
kind of , yeah .
what're you up to?
reading my reviews .
the brothel website?
can i ask you a favor?
this is just , you know , for play .
can you help me type a rsum .
come on , first shayna , now you .
no .
i'm not going anywhere .
it's just to see , hypothetically ... what else i might be qualified for .
if you leave , i'll hunt you down and kill you .
i'll keep that in mind .
okay , i've never done one of these .
i guess you put down your education first .
did you go to college at all?
fuck me , i never even finished high school .
let's skip that part then .
what do you think would be your best qualifications?
professionally speaking .
i give excellent head .
skilled at oral presentations .
i like that .
exceptional manual dexterity .
keen negotiator .
works well in group situations .
leaving out the words " orgy room .
flexible .
stimulating .
you're good .
would 69 be considered multitasking?
i don't see why not .
what's up?
nothing much .
anybody in the mood for a threesome?
i got a live one with deep pockets .
you take it .
would you mind leaving this here?
no , turn it off when you're done .
another ebony and ivory fantasy .
i'm down with that .
fucking joke .
get you another rum and coke?
thanks .
so what kind of ladies you got working here?
i'm thinking i might like to party .
do you want me to call a lineup?
no .
i'd feel bad for the ones i didn't pick .
they're used to it .
it's part of the job .
so what's your type?
female and breathing .
you might want to be a little more specific .
well , between you and me , i really like the colored girls .
the blacker the better .
and tall .
give me a set of long dark legs ... and i'm a happy man .
you're in luck .
we've got a girl just like that , started this week .
velvet .
i like her already .
is she on tonight?
yeah , she should be out any minute .
let me ask you , though , what's it gonna cost me to party with this velvet?
i don't know .
that's between you and her .
hey , velvet , want to come here a minute?
hey , what's going on?
i've got a guy who'd like to meet you .
hi .
carlos .
you thought you'd get away from me?
what the fuck do you think you're doing?
why , you didn't think i was going to find out?
you didn't think my other bitches were going to give you up?
i'm sorry .
i will fucking kill you .
you don't even think about it .
come on , bitch .
leave her alone .
lady , what , are you serious?
i mean it , let go of her .
fucking crazy !
leave her alone and get out of here .
now !
are you okay?
damn it , i should have known this guy was up to something .
how could you have?
this is still bleeding .
it's deep , but i don't think you'll need stitches .
good .
let me in there one more time .
i've got some percocets in my room if you need them .
i think aspirin will be fine , thank you .
okay , there .
what was that?
must have been the loss of blood .
no , seriously .
seriously , i have wanted to do that since ... well , how long have you worked here?
three years .
then 2 years , 11 months , and 29 days .
what was wrong with me the first day?
here you go .
cold .
ice does that .
does it hurt?
yeah .
fuck .
he was your pimp?
a bastard from the first day i met him .
keep that on here .
thanks for keeping me company .
i know i'm probably not the most popular person now .
well , it's funny .
i feel like i know you .
i guess because i used to watch you on your show .
not because we both just fucked the same guy together?
no , i think it was the show .
i always though it was funnier if i had a little bit of a buzz on .
yeah , me , too .
you ever have a pimp?
no , i didn't need one .
this is a family business for me .
so , you're related to that david guy?
no .
my grandmother worked at the mustang ranch back when it first opened .
my mom still puts in a couple days a month over at the bunnyranch .
so me doing this was pretty much a given .
even with you being a dyke?
he paid me to kiss you .
i don't mean that shit before , i mean you with that emily .
i see you looking at her all moony eyed .
can we drop this?
i don't get it .
you can talk about giving a dog a hand job , no problem ... but you can't say , maybe you like a girl .
she doesn't know .
please don't tell anyone .
i won't .
don't get too drunk , okay?
don't worry .
anyway , tommy's driving .
speaking of which , i told the limo driver to pick you two up at the hotel at noon .
have fun .
good night .
he is such a nice guy .
yeah , i guess opposites do attract .
so what do you want to do?
go back to the room and watch pay per view?
get a massage?
beth ann?
i need to talk to you for a minute .
this probably isn't fair to do to you , but i just ...
i need to say this out loud to somebody .
what is it?
remember lindsay?
she was my roommate in college , junior year?
crazy lindsay , yeah , what about her?
she worked in a brothel every weekend in nevada .
a whorehouse?
yeah .
what does this have to do with you?
one time , super bowl weekend , she knows it's going to be busy after the game ... and she says i can go with her .
no .
you didn't .
well , this was after teddy had broken up with me .
and you know what a hard time i was having with that .
i just needed somebody ... to make me feel like i was worth being with .
i made $2, 000 in , like , a day and a half .
and i was practically failing my classes anyway ... because you're the smart one .
i never finished college .
and i was never a flight attendant .
come on .
beth ann , i know has to be ...
this isn't funny .
it's true .
stop it !
please .
i didn't plan this .
this is just how it worked out .
you're a prostitute?
i was , but i was going to quit .
how many guys?
i don't know .
like hundreds?
probably .
i feel nauseous .
please , don't throw up .
i can handle almost anything but that .
no , i need to get out of here .
sweetie , are you okay?
don't !
i don't know where to put this in my brain .
every day , mommy used to call the airline to see when your plane got in .
even when she was sick , even when she was dying , she made me promise ...
to check if your flights landed okay .
i'm sorry .
i wanted to tell you so many times .
why didn't you?
evan doesn't know , does he?
no .
you have to tell him .
i can't .
he's marrying you .
it's like you said , he is a nice guy .
why do this to him?
and , my god , you saw his family .
his mother thinks if you're a stewardess you're a whore .
she would die if he told her .
i have a chance to be happy .
this isn't only about you .
beth ann , i need you , don't ...
you're disgusting .
i hope nobody sees us .
i remember when i started here , they said that they discourage ...
fuck , what do they call it?
intra house fraternizing .
yeah , i guess " don't shit where you eat " didn't sound classy enough .
well , i wouldn't worry about it .
i kind of got an in with the management .
you're so pretty .
how many of those have you had there?
i mean it , you are .
you know what you taste like?
what?
miller lite .
hey , did you know that if a guy drinks a beer ... and then eats a girl's pussy , he can give her a yeast infection?
taylor told me that .
em .
what?
don't .
don't what?
it's not a work night .
in other words , don't be such a whore .
i didn't say that .
i know .
i know you didn't .
i don't know why i thought we could do this .
come on , no , i didn't mean anything .
what , we're going to date ... and then you're going to watch me take other guys to my room all night?
i'm going to say , " i need a long island iced tea for my john back there " ... and that's going to be okay?
i don't know .
yeah .
i'll make it be okay .
how the hell are you going to do that?
i couldn't do that .
i don't know .
but i will .
emily , i'm crazy about you .
i want to make this work .
you know what?
you are one of the sweetest , kindest men i've ever met .
and , baby ... you deserve a whole lot better than for your girlfriend to be me .
busted .
can i talk to you?
yeah , come on in .
did i wake you up?
no , i couldn't fall asleep .
i'm really sorry .
i didn't think he'd find me .
at least , not so quick .
i'll pay for that lamp , the one you shot .
i bet that's the first time you ever heard that .
how's your lip?
better .
lucky we working girls got that rule about no kissing the customers because ...
did he hurt you?
before , when you were together?
all the time .
you sharing?
yeah , i'll get you a glass .
please don't fire me .
i know that's what you must be thinking right now .
please .
i don't know , velvet .
it might not be safe for you to stay .
safer than me being out on the streets with him looking for me .
i mean , for everybody else .
look , you can spend the night on the couch .
mom .
honey .
i heard talking .
everything's okay .
ray , this is velvet .
hey , ray .
do me a favor .
get pillows and a blanket from the closet .
why?
she's sleeping here?
tonight .
what , is this a whorehouse now , too?
just do what i asked you to do .
go on .
it'll be more comfortable with the pillows off .
em , you going to the doctor?
i'm sorry , what?
the doctor .
the vans are leaving in a little bit .
all right .
shayna's getting married today .
couple of hours .
i know .
i was just thinking about her .
did you and other david have an okay time last night?
it's not going to be anything .
i thought it would be , but ... actually it was a fucking disaster !
how the fuck do you have a relationship?
how do you do this job and have a boyfriend or a husband?
do you have to make up some bullshit story like shayna did , is that the only way?
no , i don't think so .
maybe you'll find somebody who gets it .
who understands this , you know ... and who loves you for who you are .
the whole package .
yeah , where the hell am i going to find that?
beth ann?
i help to you?
yeah , thanks .
could i ask you a question?
because i need an objective opinion .
i'm getting married today , apparently .
there's something he doesn't know about me .
and it's something big .
and some people might think i don't deserve to marry him .
but i'm not a horrible person , i'm not .
and , you know , people keep secrets all the time , right?
what do you think i should do?
that's fine .
thanks .
good , boris is here .
i could use more leather armbands .
let me get some cash , i'll meet you .
okay .
tay , you coming?
not right now .
okay .
i felt funny waiting inside .
they said you'd be back soon .
do you have a few minutes?
yeah .
kim , you got a second?
velvet's looking for you .
she wants to say goodbye .
what's she saying goodbye for?
why do you think?
where's mary?
kitchen .
what are the odds he'll come back here?
probably very high .
okay , so we call the sheriff .
she's a tv star , it'll be good for business .
kim , she got fired after one season on a sitcom .
you know , it's not exactly like halle berry showed up and asked for a job .
halle berry showed up and asked for a job?
yeah , she did , and i told her she could have your room .
i thought you were coming right out .
mary's firing velvet .
come on , mom , can't she stay and play with us?
can't she , please?
i'm supposed to keep this place safe for you .
besides , how would i explain this to david?
don't tell him about it , that's how .
you don't think other david called him as soon as he got out of here last night?
i can pretty much guarantee you that didn't happen .
i'll see you out there .
think about this .
velvet had this life that was happy ... she was doing her show , everything was working out for her ... and then all of a sudden , that's over with and she's alone .
do you have any idea how horrible that must feel?
you mean like when my husband died ... and he left me and ray all alone with no money and no life insurance?
yeah , i'm familiar with that feeling .
i'm sorry .
mary , i didn't know that .
any more trouble , she's out of here .
thank you .
so this is your room then?
yeah .
it's cozy .
it's the accessories that really make the difference , don't you think?
please don't make fun of me .
i'm not .
this is difficult for me to ask you .
but i came here to ask , so ...
could you help me be better at sex?
i'm sorry?
i don't think i'm making my husband happy anymore .
i'm scared that he might look for someone else .
if he hasn't already .
and i thought , maybe , you as a professional ...
of course , i'll pay you for your time .
oh , no , was that a terrible thing to ask you?
you mean as opposed to , like , asking for my special recipe for meatloaf?
i'm sorry , i had no business .
no , wait , hang on a second .
don't go .
you didn't insult me .
it's flattering .
kind of .
you're just catching me on a really bad day .
why?
what's wrong?
okay , here's the way that i figured it .
chelsea's in school all day .
we talk every night , and the week i have with her every month ... it's me and her , nobody else , that's it .
i thought that i could do this job and still be a good mother .
you know?
and i could still be a good influence on her .
what an idiot .
you must be doing something right .
chelsea's crazy about you .
she talks about you all the time .
yeah?
does she say that her mother's a fucking whore?
yes , i'm back .
i just wanna thank the academy for this great honor .
girl , i'm glad you're staying .
we need more sisters around here .
thank you , baby .
i won't forget what you did .
what do you think , boris?
nice .
sexy .
very sexy .
does it push my tits up enough?
i get you a smaller size .
thanks .
well?
pretty .
did you ask her yet?
no , but i will now .
good .
rickie lee .
we're taking up a collection to help austin get back on his feet .
you heard about the fire , right?
yeah .
each of us is going to do a trick for him today .
how about it , you in?
sure , i'll just pull a rabbit out of my snatch .
god , forget i fucking asked .
smaller size .
thanks .
boris , did you get those saddle shoes i asked you for?
you said you'd get them for me this week .
inside the truck , i'll check .
thank you .
selfish bitch .
you got something to say to me , emily , say it .
you won't give any money for austin , but you'll spend it on that sick little girl act .
you think i give a shit?
you think i give a shit what you think of me?
i don't think you give a shit about anything or anybody ... except those sleazeballs you're so busy getting off .
listen , twat face ...
i'll fucking ...
emily , stop it !
let me tell you something .
if some asshole wants to fuck a little girl ...
i'd just as soon it be me and not his 10 year old daughter .
sure i can't get you anything else?
i'm good .
the usual .
you looking to party?
i'm waiting for emily .
i'm better .
i'm gay .
i've got a cub scout uniform i could wear if that would do it for you .
no , thanks .
for somebody who doesn't sleep with girls , you spend a lot of time at a whorehouse .
what?
one of the singers in the show ... at the hilton , they're doing this '60s revival thing ...
janis joplin girl got strep .
my uncle heard your tape , he wants you to audition .
get out of here .
it's only temporary ...
is this for real?
yeah .
get out of here .
oh , my god .
i love you .
what's going on?
i got an audition , singing , in reno .
that's fantastic .
oh , my god , i could fuck you till the cows come home .
please don't .
here we go .
to emily .
to emily .
i , shayna , take you , evan , to be my husband .
to have and to hold from this day forward .
for better , for worse , for richer , for poorer .
in sickness and in health , to love and to cherish , until death do us part .
before god and in the presence of this congregation ...
evan and shayna have made their solemn vows to each other .
therefore , i proclaim that they are now husband and wife .
evan , you may kiss your bride .
what are you doing?
living vicariously .
here .
give it a shot .
you ready?
you're not going to hurt it .
attagirl .
you don't like it much here , do you?
i don't know .
not yet .
getting there .
i love it here .
men fuck me , and then they pay me , it's unbelievable .
you can make an ugly guy feel handsome .
you can make an old guy feel young .
the power of the pussy , right?
and the money .
oh , man .
hookers make pretty much the same hourly rate that lawyers do .
i mean , beat that with a stick .
taylor , why are you telling me all this?
because i have to leave .
peter?
chels?
no .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
that son of a bitch .
hello , diamond ranch .
no , i'm sorry .
she doesn't work here anymore .
i know .
but if you come in , we have a number of very beautiful girls ... and i'm sure you'll find someone you can be satisfied with .
okay .
aren't you going to congratulate the bride?
oh , shayna .
