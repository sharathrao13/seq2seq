i want him to know he was the best of all of us , ... ... and most of all , a very good friend .
you going be missed by all of us you know .
excuse me lily , was that a kiss?
or did your lips just slip?
it's not that i didn't like it but i don't know what to think anymore .

we've known each other for two years now .

i take a long time to decide .
and what made you decide?
your cleavage .
it's nice , eh?
the dress is brand new .
ok then we'll try not to damage it .
are you sure it's okay after all these years of friendship?
we prepared the ground well , it's time to build on it .
maybe we could wait a little bit more .
no , if i wait more , ... ... i'm worried that you'll take it badly and i don't want to be rude .
oh , no .
what?
it's 6 o'clock .
but it's saturday .
yes , but i have to go to work .
what?
you just stopped working last night , you didn't find a job during the night , did you?
no , it's for my future job ... ... a kind of meeting i booked a long time ago .
i thought you were waiting for our meeting for a long time .
yes , a long time plus an hour .
and when i say 1 hour , that's the maximum .
hey blue , you take a number over there .

i use super unleaded .
i just outran 2 cops , you should have seen it .
ok i'll tell you , 2 police on bikes on the street .
when they shifted into first , i was already on the beach .
they were furious .

those 2 won't forget paulo that easily .
i assure you they did not forget you , paulo .
hey girls .

go , paulo .
hey girls , going to the beach?
today it's free .
it will be a pleasure .
coming?
hey are you a " taxi " , or a nice taxi?
the driver is really nice .
he opens the door , doesn't make you car sick , and doesn't speak if not asked to .
and he carries the bags if asked nicely .
thank you , perfect .
and where are we going , miss?
you see the pink house over there , with a big door?
yes , i see it .
that's where we're going .
do you prefer a route in particular?
put all that in the kitchen , i'll organise it later .
you have enough food for a week there .
oh no , my son is coming for lunch .
he eats all that in one meal?
no .
sunday he prepares ... ... all his meals for the week ,
his apartment is so small there's no kitchen .
and he can't even cook an egg .
look .
that's him in the picture .
he's a computer geek .
he works at ibm .
everybody has their thing .
and you?
what is your " thing "?
i love driving , but you probably didn't have time to see it !
my son is taking his driving exam for the 8th time .
8 times !
8 is my lucky number it will be good for him .
at the end of the street , we're going to turn to the ... to the ... to the ... to the
to the left , mr. carbadec .
to the left , to the left !
to the left !
are you nuts?
we're going to crash !
jesus christ !
i've never seen such an idiot in the 10 years i've worked here !
can't you tell right from left?
yes but you should have told me sooner .
should i have sent a sax?
left left !
it's no so difficult to turn a steering wheel and press a pedal !
everyone has their strengths .
and you what is your job?
where they hell do they hire idiots like that?
in a circus , in a zoo , the government or what?
a little bit of all three .
ah you should have said it earlier .
should i have sent a fax?
excuse me .
can i offer you something , inspector?
thank you , that's great .
thanks you .
you're so nice , i'm going to keep your card .
i don't want to be rude but i need to go work , is it ok if i eat in the taxi?
of course , go ahead .
go work !
can you save my life?
in theory , no .
it depends on your symptoms .
i have a flight in 25 minutes .
if i miss it i'm a dead man .
if i catch it , you're a rich man .
hmm ... the gentleman is lucky .
i'm no doctor , ... ... but i really like emergencies .
buckle up please ! .
maybe we should go now .
here we go .
a white taxi moving really fast !
he knocked down my radar !
we'll care of it got his plate number?
i didn't have the time it was too fast .
open your eyes , it's your job .
do you think we're going to make it on time?
because if we're going to miss it maybe we should take our time .
it'll be ok , we're going slow now , but on the highway we'll speed up .
ah i see , i see .
don't take all these risks for me !
i don't want you to lose your license .
no problem , i don't have a license .
fantastic .
14 minutes and 30 seconds .
leaves you time to read the paper and maybe a cup of coffee .
have a good trip , sir .
thank you .
i don't understand .
on the computer i'm unbeatable .
first in monaco , 8 pole positions .
but on the streets i'm a disaster .
so?
how did you do?
i didn't make it .
that's impossible .
i know champagne is better with time ... ... but now it's almost past the due date .
what happened?
nothing , i just crashed into a butcher shop .
you know what?
you should put a mouse in your car , instead of your steering wheel .
like the disabled .
what?
come on ...
emilien , someone just set a new record .
a taxi , near the harbour .
you know how fast?
140?
yeah , in first gear .
then he switched into 2nd ... 217 km/ h !
did they get him?
yeah of course , they called in the air force .
imagine at that speed .
hey , have you heard this one?
listen , it's funny .
what's the difference between a comb and a moron?
ok you're not listening .
i'll come back later .
yes .
much later , and if it's at night , that's even better .
next time , knock before you enter !
petra ...
i don't mean that for you .
thanks , emilien .
so how did it go with your test , was it bad?
ah , news travels fast .
i have news for you , the chief is having a meeting now , and only you are missing .
well , nobody told us you know !
all you have to do is push this button ...
you see there , it's written " power " .
you hear me?
i said in my office right now , are you deaf emilien?
not anymore , boss .
after hitting banks in holland , italy and belgium ... the mercedes gang has arrived in france
and the germans must absolutely not invade our territory again .
my grandfather died in their hands , so it's a personnal matter .
so the paris bonn liaison , german french friendship , can kiss my ass .
alright?
that doesn't apply to you petra .
you're german ... fine , but you're a cop so it's ok .
and they have the gall to announce the cities before hitting the banks !
it's unbelievable !
within 3 days , they will hit a bank in marseille .
red alert , 24 hours a day !
we will have some support in the form of one trained driver per team .
as soon as the germans leave the bank , our teams will follow them . ... not losing them , acting like a venom ....
that's why this operation will be called ... cobra .
petra , can you assemble the teams please?
3 per car .
one driver , one coordinator and one sniper .
each team has a code name and a position written on the map behind you .
the team members are listed next to the map .
you have 50 minutes to get into position .
excuse me petra , it's that dinner we talked about ... ... this week would be nice , because ... ... the computer software i developed , that we've talked about ... it would be better not to wait too long , somebody could steal the idea .
no .
just who can't wait , you or the software?
me
no , him ... it , the software ... the computer .
you see , it's complicated that's why i thought ... ... a dinner ...
as soon as the germans are arrested , i promise , i'll take care of you ... ... of the software i mean .
ah perfect .
by the way , which team are you in?
i'm with the cobra .
don't worry , you got lucky .
i put you in the best team .
hey , i think we're out of coffee .
have you seen my steering wheel?
it's great , it's personalized ... ... i bought it from alain prost .
with a new grip , special dakar .
with even a ton of sand in the car ...
oh yeah?
too bad we aren't at the beach then .
hey hey , don't smoke , it irritates my eyes .
no coffee , no smoking ...
no chicks !!
boa calling tiny snake .
boa calling tiny snake .
this is tinysnake , i hear you .
yeah , it's alan .
is your team any good?
amazing .
we're all exchanging addresses .
and you?
me?
somebody is pissing on us but apart from that everything's fine .
rachid , check out the small black peugot behind us .
man , you're crazy marco !
we're not going to steal a car during the day !
oh yeah , why not?
fuck marco !
there could be cops around here !
we don't know this neighbourhood , we should stick to what we know .
don't worry , all the cops are at the airport !
there aren't any around here for 20 km .
man .
this is crazy .
calm down man !
all the cops are at the airport i told you !
i saw it on tv , there's clinton and this girl .
hey , cops !
check it out , marco is here , he's gonna screw you !
let's arrest him .
no , let him take the car , ... ... let him finish his show , we need the space .
i need to take a leak .
no we can't leave the car , it's orders .
you see?
all at the airport like i said .
smile guys , you're on camera .
i tell you guys if they don't show up in one minute with their mercedes ... ... it's going to be coffee , a smoke and a shit .
we're going to do all that later man !
to all snakes ... no venom until the mouse leaves its hole .
i repeat no venom until the exit .
lieutenant?
petra , you're disturbing me , i was into it .
i know , but it's the minister .
minister , you aren't at the airport?
we just finished .
tell me gibert what about that mercedes gang you told me about?
yes , you couldn't have called at a better time , we just located them .
we're going to act soon .
good , wait a second ...
i just talked to the german minister stop there
they won't have time to visit marseille
tonight they'll be in jail , and tomorrow i'll send the nazis back home ... special delivery .
exactly my point .
i don't want to see this end in a shootout between germans and french .
the war is over , gibert .
of course it is , mister .
they are criminals just like any others , they won't be treated any differently .
maybe you should start by not calling them nazis .
ah , i called them nazis?
yes .
ah , i called them nazis?
yes .
i can count on you?
yes , don't worry , remember the chinks ...
um , i mean the asians .
everything went smoothly .
almost no deaths , at least not on our side .
hello?
hello?
he hung up !
you see , it's easy .
where are the wires?
shit , marco ! hurry up !
are you going to steal the car or do i have to give you the keys?
we are the tiny snakes and that means we stay " cool " .
we're going to take it " cool " , and not get venomous .
to all snakes , don't mess up , we want them alive .
at least for an hour .
i don't really feel in the mood , i guess i'd better leave you guys .
and ...
i really have to take a leak .
let's go !!
what's going on?
it doesn't look good , minister .
don't move , minister .
shit !
we fell into a trap , send us backup .
i identified the car ...
i repeat , i identified the accomplice car .
4 well trained men .
backup are coming , minister !
shit , shit !
sir ...
i think we are shooting at cops .
they're giving up ... aren't they?
hello , this is tiny snake , we've had a small problem with the door .
good morning sir .
don't worry , we'll have you free you in 5 minutes .
no problem , no problem .
thank you , sir .
ok , they're giving up .
funny ... he looks just like ...
like the minister .
oh , you didn't eat anything .
i'm not really hungry today .
mom , no .
don't worry about your license .
remember your father , he never got one either .
how is that possible?
i remember him driving when i was young yes , it's true .
he took the exam 20 times and in the end they just gave it to him !
ah thanks , i feel a lot better now .
you're welcome .
here , david , the landlord's son asked me if you could fix this .
yeah , tell him my name isn't super mario .
no , i know your name is super cop , the one who upholds the law ... and protects citizens against evil .
oh dear , you have a good profession , i'm proud you .
oh really !
that's why you tell everyone i work at ibm?
do you want me to bring you all the neighborhood parking tickets?
no .
so fine , you work at ibm .
you're quiet and so am i.
i get to fix all the neighborhood electronic toys .
never happy .
mom , i'm kidding !
can you call me a taxi?
i'm going to be late .
i just met the perfect one !
friendly , pleasant , the cream of the crop .
you'll like him very much .
hello?
am i on the wrong floor?
that depends , who you are looking for?
i'm looking for camille .
that's me .
i mean , that's here .
oh you're her son the one who works at apple .
no , ibm .
ibm .
mom !
i don't know anything about computers .
but i saw your picture the other day .
ah daniel , this is my son emilien .
i put labels on them monday is veal , tuesday ...
ok mom , i promise , i'll be ok .
maybe we should go now .
i left the car alone , i'm worried .
good bye !
ah kiss .
kiss , kiss mom !
where are we going?
voltaire boulevard .
i remember the police station but not ibm .
we are going to the police station .
i install computers there .
if you don't mind , i'm going to leave you just near the station .
i don't really like being around pigs .
say , that motor sounds great for a taxi .
you know cars?
just a fan .
it's a v6 , a bit modified .
a motor just wants to " sing " .
um , don't sing too loud , the speed limit is 50 .
you're talking about the signs written 50?
yeah .
i thought it was for skateboards .
no , no , i think it's for anything that drives .
there's driving and driving , you see i'm at 100 .
good car ... ... good driver , i'm relaxed .
no risks .
i'm less dangerous at 100 then that shit at 20 km/ h .
there ...
you saw it?
i saw it , yeah !
you're not afraid of radars?
we know where there are radars .
pigs doesn't like change .
always eating at the same place .
you'll see , there's one just here .
you see them , they're so stupid .
picture !
picture !
you know they can't do anything about it , they just follow the system .
they signed up , nobody forced them .
sometimes i guess they are forced to join
'cause you need to be stupid to join the police force .
look , ... ... i see them a lot ... because of the computers .
the image i had of them was wrong .
really?
it's worse than we hear of them?
no . it's better .
there aren't just idiots in the police force .
right , there are also alcoholics , crooks , morons !
seriously , between us ... ... you know any normal person who would want to join the pig farm?
and taxi drivers?
what about them?
you know anybody that would want to become a taxi driver?
those complainers that take you only when feel like it .
and that scream at you when the tip isn't good .
and drinking in the coffee shops !
they are all friends with the police .
y se casan con una portera para tener casa gratis .
you're not married to a cop?
no ...
ah that's reassuring !
ok , there are maybe a few drivers who are rude with the customers .
but they are not all like you said .
so?
with the police it's the same thing .
they aren't all drunk at 6 in the morning , beating on innocent people .
some of them do their jobs , just like you ... and like me .
maybe , yeah maybe .
but the thing is , being a taxi driver isn't my real job .
ah you drive a taxi only for fun ... what is your real job then?
i'm going to show you .
do you have a bag , i don't feel good .
don't worry , as long as we drive fast , nothing will come out .
shit !
i'm sorry sir , that's the first time that's happened with me .
usually the client gets out and walks a bit ... then ...
i'm really sorry .
i'm going to confess something .
me too , that's not my real job ...
oh , no .
oh , yes .
last and first name .
morales , daniel .
profession ... should i write crazy taxi driver or just crazy driver?
whatever you want .
at what speed were you going back there?
barely 90 .
barely 90 .
yes , it seems worse because the motor really kicks . ... but in reality , the car doesn't really go that fast .
hey world champion , how's it going?
very good .
can you go look in the stands to see if i'm there?
remember that taxi , we saw it 5 minutes ago on the street .
going 190 km/ h .
he's slowing down !
you see?
not 90 ... 190 .
ah , must be the sun .
i didn't see the 1 on the speedometer .
that's why i saw 90 .
if i had known , i would have slowed down .
anyway , 90 is illegal .
the limit is 50 ... for everybody ! cars , skateboards , taxis ... everybody !
is he happy now? caught ht me , did his job , he's happy now .
my license is my living , if tonight i'm not driving , tomorrow i'm dead .
you're going to be nice and finish me quickly .
hey slow down , so i can enjoy it a bit .
usually i'm the one screamed at all day , now for once i get lucky .
i didn't knock because of my wrist .
ah it doesn't matter .
that you didn't knock i mean .
thank you .
your dinner , your software that can't wait .
yes?
so it will wait until i've healed .
unless you want to have dinner with a scarecrow .
i doesn't bother me ... you're perfect petra .
it's not important ...
i mean no ... yes it matters
it's important .
it's very bad for you ... ... but for me .. for the software it doesn't matter .
you see !
all day it's like that .
if only i could catch those german bastards
you're going to finish me now?
you'll see , you'll feel better .
yeah , i have to ... unless you have an idea .
can promise not to do it again?
i said an idea , not a an idiocy .
i'm talking about a real idea of public interest .
you want to turn me in a dog shit cleaner?
no !
something of public interest , for me .
understand?
it's like i represent the public ... ... and you do something in my interest .
ah you want money ! .
you're really stupid !
tell me clearly what you want .
it's been an hour now with your blabbing .
what do you want?
listen .
the mercedes gang , does that ring a bell?
no , the only gangs i know would be into scooters .
they're a gang specialized in robbing banks .
yesterday was the 7th .
and that pisses me off .
ah that's too bad .
yes , mostly for us .
listen , i'll make you a proposal .
you're a good mechanic , you drive well and i need a driver .
3 good reasons to hire you as an assistant for 1 month .
i'll remove all your infractions .
you want me to be a cop for 1 month?
choose : cop or pedestrian .
death or shame?
you got it .
here you have all 7 attacks in order .
don't know much about mercedes i'm more ferrari .
right now the gang is " mercedes " but as soon they get into ferraris , i'll call you .
a red mercedes , how awful .
i know it's red , tell us something we don't know .
we've looked everywhere but maybe ...
we just need a detail .
you're talking about a detail ...
your gang .
they're german .
very nice !
mercedes , therefore germans .
you want to relax 5 minutes now?
you must be exhausted .
the tires are very inflated , typical of germans .
also they have 8 " so they had to do that in germany 'cause you can't find that in france .
the tires are quite worn , they'll need to order some soon .
in this picture , the muffler is a little bent but not on this one .
they must have bent it during an attack and repaired it afterwards .
kruger is the only one who repairs this type in marseille .
and kruger is german .
luckily you're not a mercedes expert !
where are we going?
we're starting with kruger to see if he remembers anything .
what are you waiting for?
you want me to sing a song?
in this neighbourhood , i wouldn't turn the christmas lights on .
what are we doing now?
we're starting the phase that takes 80 % of a policeman's life ... ... observation .
get familiar with the terrain , observation of entrances and exits . ... and analyse the situation .
when it closes we'll go ask mr. kruger a few questions .
when does the store close?
kruger?
he never closes , he's an insomniac .
thanks !
they didn't have anything else .
too bad we didn't stop by my mother's , she makes terrific sandwiches .
ham and cheese .
half bayonne , half parisian .
it's excellent .
she made you one?
yeah .
a small slice of cheese in the middle with lettuce . ... and pickles .
fabulous .
this is mine?
really good , congratulations .
what does he do?
they're koreans .
a real pain in the ass for me , they work 24 hours a day .
he must sleep at some point , they're human .
no , they've got a " technique " .
one taxi , one plate , one license ... ... and 2 drivers .
you can tell the difference between 2 koreans incredible .
i know a korean , he's in the food business .
no .
we wait for him to close the garage .
we're going to wait a long time , the guy is an insomniac and never closes .
how do you know that?
from the bar owner just in front of us .
why didn't you tell me before?
i haven't been in the police force long , i don't have the reflexes .
it's not a matter of being a cop , it's just common sense , shit !
we're here like 2 idiots waiting for an insomniac to go to sleep !
does that sound logical to you?
if i'm the mercedes driver and i know the mechanic is an insomniac ... ... i'll come during the night , it's much more discrete .
oh yeah?
you think the driver will just show up ... ... with his nice mercedes?
i can't believe it !
when a driver isn't driving , he's in the garage .
what are they doing there?
probably the 8 " tires they ordered from kruger .
it's a miracle !
i can't let such an opportunity get away .
if it goes bad , call the station and give them the mercedes plate numbers .
where are you going?
after observation , action .
the korean trick .
what?
the korean trick !
what an idiot !
and the new tires , where are they going to put them?
what are you doing there?
me?
sleeping .
i don't have a house , my country is very cold .
please !
don't hurt me !
i just wanted to sleep .
i'm going to find you a house where you'll sleep ... and even eat maybe with a little bit of luck .
hey you're hurting me !
i just do what i can .
what's your name?
daniel .
ah , yeah .
daniel .
i'm emilien .
we're going to call each other by name , it'll be better .
yeah , better .
now that we're friends , what just happened ...
it stays between us ...
when you let go of my hand , can i go to bed?
i'm no insomniac or korean .
of course not .
i waited for you all night .
i did it on purpose , so that you really want me .
you won't regret waiting .
promises , promises .
let me see what you can do .
ah , not too bad .
a little bit more .
huh?
what's going on?
it's 6 am and it's not sunday , it's monday .
you can't do that , lily .
i waited all night .
and me?
did i play dominos?
can't you call in sick?
sick on monday morning?
my boss will love that .
nobody has ever tried that one .
it can happen to anybody to be sick monday morning .
you went to eat at your parents and you ate too much ... ... and you puked all night .
it's possible , isn't it?
a man that works all week and then isn't around on sunday .
do you think it's reasonable?
i'm really sorry , lily .
i had a shitty day .
i promise that if you accept a dinner here tonight , i'll explain everything .
ok , just a light meal .
i don't want to be sick on tuesday morning .
yes , a short time at the table and a long time in bed .
we could even eat in bed to save time .
you'd better be good , it's your last chance .
i'm going to impress you .
we're going to wait all day in front of the garage again?
observation is finished , now comes questioning .
are you interested in seeing some real questioning?
no .
well , you're going to come anyway .
it's better if i wait in the taxi , in case things go bad ... like last time .
i need a translator .
i don't want him to confuse me with technicalities .
kruger won't waste time to kick you out , i'm telling you .
good morning people .
which one of you is called kruger , please?
it's written on the label just like a waitress .
mr. kruger , i've got a few questions for you .
don't worry , it won't be long .
fuck no more ammo !
what for?
they left a long time ago .
really?
open your eyes , there's nobody here .
oh yeah , nobody .
can i ask you a little question?
what?
are your questioning sessions always like that , or was it just to please me?
usually i get to ask at least 1 question .
let's go out to get some air .
you know , you saved my life back there .
no .
yes .
it was worth a lot .
so let's get rid of that one month of labour .
and turn it into only 1 week .
you know how to deal .
i need to catch that gang , it's important for me .
because of the blonde chick?
no .
in part yes , but mostly for me .
i'm tired of finishing off nights in the garbage can .
it's a question of honour , maybe it's crazy , but i need this .
can i have the night for myself?
you've got to be kidding .
can i borrow him?
mom , it's because ...
i lost my prescription and the doctor agreed to write another one .
they're closing in 5 minutes .
it's my heart medicine .
i won't let you die here , and that way i'll have saved the whole family today .
you're so charming , daniel .
i know , i know .
look johnny , here they come .
don't worry , baby .
i've put a transmitter in that bullet , that way they won't get away .
you're so clever johnny it's my job , baby .
johnny .
now we just have to follow them .
incredible ! ... let's save your father .
i'll never forget what you've done for me johnny .
it's my job , baby .
guys , we just received a call .
they give us a rendezvous .
it's gonna be the bank of marseille .
since they are clear with us , i'm going to be the same with you .
i won't tolerate any misbehaviour , any accidents , nothing !
perfect coordination .
there are 2 words for this mission ...
serenity ... ... and efficiency .
so i've decided to name this mission ..
the mission ... ...
zen .
chief !
listen up tiny snakes and cobras !
i just got the idea of the century .
the mercedes gang will be nailed tonight , or my name isn't emilien barbadec .
i hope your plan is foolproof 'cause this is your last chance .
you've got the gun , so be nice and don't miss .
everybody on the floor !
quickly !
hands on the head !
lie down !
don't move .
come on !
it's working .
good , very good .
follow them at a distance .
so you won't be scared .
they stopped .
gauguin street .
i'm telling you , we've got them .
this is gilbert .
all units : close off gauguin street at 10 km . around .
they didn't move .
just one street .
what's happening?
the dot disappeared .
i know it disappeared .
find out why it vanished .
they must be this way , ... ... a red mercedes doesn't go by unnoticed .
they're close , i can feel it .
they're supposed to be here .
go , go !
don't shoot , i'm the hostage .
emilien ...
how ...?
i don't understand , i'm missing something .
a red mercedes vanished .
even houdini never did that .
hello , your papers please .
what's going on , officer?
you're german?
yes why?
already at the border?
chief , 4 germans in a mercedes , not red .
interested?
i'll handle it .
so you're german .
yes , is that a problem?
no , it's good actually .
open the trunk .
what are they doing in marseille?
they came to spend deutchmarks ...
... but they can do that in another country if you prefer ...
no , ... ... i prefer that you keep that in our territory .
ok , goodbye .
have a nice stay .
emilien .
i don't understand , it's impossible .
i must have missed something .
you see , he forgot about the kettle .
you think so?
he's not like that .
it's 8pm .
i've turned on the answering machine , and the alarm is set for 6am .
we've got 10 hours .
it should be enough , no?
i think it's going to be close ... ... but we can hurry just a bit at the end .
expecting somebody?
yes my lover , but when i found out you'd come , i cancelled .
who could it be?
leave it , they'll probably go .
where were we?
i was kissing you .
no , you were kissing me .
and if it's important?
how?
i don't know ... the cops ...
yeah , maybe you're a notorious criminal and they've come to get you .
you would take me hostage .
and if you just took me now?
open , police !
you didn't kill anybody?
no .
thank god , daniel !
you're here !
fantastic !
you just can't imagine what shit i'm in .
yes , i can imagine .
no , no you can't imagine .
it's gone , we don't have an apartment anymore .
the apartment that my father gave us .
gone up in smoke , just like my father .
my husband smoked a lot , ... ... but he died of liver cancer , we never knew why , he didn't drink .
the apartment is nothing , the worst is that i messed up again .
if i don't catch them by the end of the week , i'll be on traffic patrol by monday .
stick , whistle , move along kids !
what i'm saying is , monday i'm dead .
daniel , who's that dwarf?
a friend .
really?
playing with smurfs now?
it's a bit complicated , he's a cop ...
what?
you've got a friend in the police?
not a real friend , ...
... i work for him , because ...
you work for the cops?
no , not for the cops , for him !
he's not really a cop .... ... he looks more like a secret agent , or something like that .
right , and the old lady is mata hari .
can someone explain this to her?
i can't do it .
hello .
my name is camille .
the smurf over there is my son , emilien .
i want you to show me the kitchen , i'm going to make us some coffee . and then i'll explain everything .
there's nothing to explain mom ... ... i'm finished , i'm in the street .
it's over , but it started so well ... but then came the garbage bin , the butcher , the mercedes ...
what are you going to do with them then?
should i call the cops , the real ones?
just be nice , and don't complicate the situation .
ok , agreed?
i'm not complicating the situation .
i just want to finish what we started .
and i don't want to waste an hour because the schedule is very tight .
i'm caught in a tight spot and when i say caught i mean seriously .
i could lose my license for 100 years .
i help him and he gives me back my licence , 100 years of unemployment you see?
police , blackmailer , and smurf .
nice picture , you could have finished him before putting him in traffic .
here you go , it was completely stupid of me .
i'm not kidding , you're free .
take it .
daniel , you know i didn't come here because of our deal .
i haven't got any other friends .
mom told me you had a big heart .
daniel has a big heart .
really , he'll help? .
ok , i think we made a mistake .
it doesn't matter .
it's not important , it's not your problem .
don't worry , i'll catch that gang alone .
without a car , it won't be easy .
but i'm gonna do it .
listen , the best way to get rid of him is to solve his problem .
but he doesn't have one problem , he's got a thousand .
look at his face , he reminds me of " silence of the lambs " .
you take care of mata hari and i'll take care of the smurf .
in 2 hours i'm back .
and what do i do with the lady for 2 hours?
should we play bingo?
please , lily .
if in 2 hours you're not here , i burn the lady .
it's a deal .
come on .
where are we going?
to solve your problem .
i'm sorry to have ruined your evening .
your coffee is really good?
the best in town .
a nice coffee to change the mood and for forgiveness .
i know you don't really want to talk to me anymore , but please listen .
ok?
is 1 minute enough?
yes .
i thought about it all night and there was one question i couldn't answer .
why are they pissing us off like that?
why a red mercedes when grey is much more discrete?
look here , then ... ... it appears over there !
it's a diversion !
conclusion : i think they left the building empty handed and the money took another route .
or maybe the money is still in the bank .
1 minute , end of show .
i'll be back later .
10 grand .
thank you very much .
to help pay the rent for the next few years .
and my wife?
you really want her?
well , i'm used to her now .
calm down dear .
now , everything's going to be fine .
one more bank , and we retire .
and for the last one , i suggest we finish greatly .
emilien .
emilien !
you're a pain .
i'll tell you how they changed from a red to a grey mercedes .
go ahead .
they didn't change the car , they changed the colour .
a nice red mercedes enters the parking lot ... ... and a classic grey mercedes exists and then disappears .
is it possible?
child's play .
if they did repaint the car we would have found paint traces somewhere .
unless they used a truck to get the car in .
they'd need to buy tons of paint if they do that each time .
they did it in record time , they had less than 10 minutes .
is there paint which dries in 10 minutes?
hello , geg?
sorry to wake you , it's daniel .
i need your magic paint , the md10 .
color metal grey .
you ran out?
who could have bought all that in one shot?
at the race track?
what are they doing with that much paint?
are they painting the track red?
no , don't worry about it .
i'll try dealing with them myself .
talk to you soon , thanks man .
what does that mean , md10?
less than 10 minutes .
so?
you like my theory?
you think it's them?
no , it's some old ladies training every tuesday .
explain it to me daniel .
what's the plan?
what are you doing?
we're going to say hello .
they're going to see us .
yep , we'll make it so they won't forget us .
they're going to remember me , they saw me in the trunk !
put that on .
oh shit .
is it alright like that?
it's perfect .
hey faggots , everything ok?
think you're schumacher?
you spin around the track .
what are those little cars you've got?
mercedes?
they build cars too?
do germans know how to play the tortoise and the hare?
he doesn't know how to play?
i'm going to teach him .
give me 55 .
maybe i should get out now , eh?
no , you'll see , they're playful .
the turtle and the hare goes like this ... ... 55 to the one that passes my car over 2 laps .
1 + 1 .
you know how to count?
we don't want the money .
i said 55 because i had a good conscience not to take more .
but a tourist that doesn't get robbed is not really a tourist , right?
look in your rear view mirror in case i've already lapped you after the 1st lap .
so it wouldn't be worth an doing an extra lap .
thanks girls !
get lost !
quick !
it's not that i'm bored but i gotta go to the garage .
i don't know what's going on with my car .
it just doesn't run fast anymore .
whenever you want , we'll have a rematch .
here's your 55 .
what are we doing now?
let's get a drink .
french ...
you're completely crazy , we had the whole gang .
and you pull that stupid stunt?
we could have called for backup and got them !
yeah , on what?
speeding ... on a race track?
great evidence .
we would have found the evidence later , we do it all the time .
we need to catch them in the act , that's what you said?
yes or no?
but for the moment we're only collecting offences .
if we continue , it's us who will end up in jail .
you'll have your flag .
now they're all warmed up and nobody's more playful than a pilot .
now we can set a trap for them .
yeah?
what kind of trap?
a trap for idiots .
and what is your " idiot trap "?
not an " idiot trap " .
i said a trap for idiots .
ok .
how does it goes?
it goes like this : we make them go where we want .
and this is : here .
we'll need 20 traffic light keys and 20 super walkie talkies .
walkie talkies are ok but for the keys , the guys always carry them .
except when they take their showers .
oh no?
oh yes .
oh no?
oh yes .
you've got talent !
here you go , jimmy .
it's going to take time , i'm freezing .
one minute .
emilien , i got one ...
what are you doing naked?
i'm not naked .
i've got a towel wrapped around me .
what do you care?
i have the right to be naked in my office , no?
it's my office isn't it?
yes .
nobody taught you to knock before entering?
you've never learned anything idiot !
oh , what a welcome !
i wanted to tell you a good joke .
your jokes are never funny , get out !
ah ! it feels so good !
come in !
petra ... !
am i disturbing you?
never !
yes , i can see i'm disturbing you .
i'll come back later .
for once she comes into my office with something to tell me ... ... and i'm naked in the middle of the office .
can you believe that daniel?
what can i say?
anyway look at that ...
she's so beautiful .
and she's already sergeant .
what could she want with a guy like me?
ho , ho .
enough .
you're done whining?
you already started digging your grave .
she's not lady charity .
an engine like her doesn't work with low grade oil .
what she needs is a man .
get up !
you look more like an monkey now .
stand up straight !
now you go see her and you kiss her and that's it .
you either get a slap in the face or you get her for at least 10 years .
there's a 50/ 50 chance .
if it doesn't work at least you'll know .
it's like a game show , either you get it or you don't .
are you ok , emilien?
are you alright?
you're right .
we shouldn't worry like that .
i'll go for it .
i got it .
it was a 50/ 50 .
he'll have other chances .
where are we with the keys?
done !
take them .
you think they're going to be mad?
if a girl shows up 17 hours late , what would you do?
i kill her .
so you got your answer !
but we've got flowers here .
oh the nice flowers !
can we smoke them?
did you bake all these cakes?
yes .
since we both didn't get any love , we got our revenge on the cakes .
what a crisis !
thanks , camille .
i had a wonderful day .
are the flowers for me?
thanks , goodbye .
you don't want to have a intimate evening?
you've got visitors , daniel .
you have to take care of them .
we'll do it an other day , we're not short of time .
camille will sleep in your bed , her back hurts .
good night boys .
man this is good stuff .
sure , it's jamaican .
you see , it's not so bad in the forces .
stop it , you're tempting me .
tell me , why didn't you race directly instead of doing it with a taxi?
my father spent his life in a wheelchair because of a car accident .
how could i explain him that i wanted to be a race car driver?
i see .
and you?
how did you end up where you are?
my story isn't bad either .
my dad died when i was 17 , my mother and i were alone .
so i had to go to work right away .
and without a degree , only the cops wants you .
where did you live?
in asnires .
in jules ferry?
yes .
why?
you too?
yes , i swear .
it's crazy , we could have ended up in the same class .
i would have taught you to steal bikes and you wouldn't have turned out so bad !
life's like that , you dream about so many things when you're a kid and in the end ... ... nothing goes as planned .
you dream of playing forward and you end up a goalie .
do you think our plan will work , daniel?
it will work .
are you sure?
come in .
am i disturbing you?
no , i'm fine now .
what do you need?
red alert !
guys , the cougar's plan has started .
it's the s. d. l. m. banks .
here are you positions for today .
arthur , at the crossroads n 1 .
jacky , n 2 , ... ... at national flamarion crossroads .
momo at the crossroads de le bech .
n 2 , radio and key .
n 3 , radio and key .
n 4 ...
yes?
yes , i know you'll come back in 1 hour .
exactly .
i'll wait for you at your place .
cougar speaking the bird is in the cage .
everybody quiet !
on your knees !
cougar speaking .
the bird will soon leave his cage .
prepare yourselves .
shit , they got hostages .
don't do anything yet .
sorry , no more room for you .
ok , no problem .
you're going to run next to the car .
it won't be bad for you .
i'm tired !
shit !
all cougar units get out !
catch the bird !
catch the bird !
you see it's not the mercedes we needed to follow ... it's the mercedes truck we needed to follow .
this calls for a toast !
and now we all go home !
cheers !
cheers !
it's a go .
everything ready?
20 strategic points blocked .
if they cross any of these diagonals they're caught like rats .
if they take michelet boulevard , they'll end up at place mazard .
who's on that corner?
jean bat , n 7 .
call him , he'll be the opening act .
n 7 , jean bat .
you hear me?
yes , i'm here .
you'll be the first , are you in position?
yes , no problem .
so it's our turn now .
it doesn't fit there .
yes , yes .
hey bavarians , how are you?
still driving the tractor?
sorry about last time .
i forgot i had the handbrake on , that's why i didn't go very fast .
hey , i'm talking to you .
now it's a lot better .
do we race again or are you staying the losers?
ok .
you french always have such big mouths .
come onto the highway with me , we'll see !
did i upset you?
i'm going blow up your peugeot !
sorry , i did upset you .
i'll give you an other chance , but i'll try harder this time .
i feel cheap taking money from you so easily .
here you go darling , 10 francs .
you're going to pay for your insolence .
better to be insolent than ridiculous !
i think you overdid it a bit .
no , no .
tell 7 , 8 and 9 to go to red .
jean bat , go to red now .
n 10 , in position .
n 11 , in position .
perfect .
12 and 13 , prepare yourselves .
this is number 13 .
i've got a small problem here .
there are 2 cops at the traffic light .
shit !
get rid of them !
easy to say !
they're not going anywhere .
we're getting close , find a solution !
otherwise , we're finished .
pollo , let me talk to the cops .
sorry sir , it's for you .
hello .
this is sergeant gibert , we've found a bomb and it's just next to you .
where?
in the traffic light .
stay calm , we know how to stop the mechanism .
listen carefully : put the key in the light and make the light turn red .
it's already red !
don't worry about the colour ! ... just turn the key to the right !
yes , yes , sergeant .
we just passed 12 .
hurry up , hurry up !
can i do it?
19 and 20 , get ready .
after 20 , there's nothing .
i know .
are you sure there's a road there?
it's a shortcut .
on the highway , they're dead .
we've got more power .
if there was a fence , maybe there was a reason .
yep , the highway isn't finished , it's a dead end .
the important thing is that you know it .
i look calm like but in fact i'm not .
it won't be long .
that's what worries me , i want to live long !
10 seconds .
take that frog !
we've got to stop , there's no bridge !
5 seconds .
go !
take him !
take him !
let them win , daniel !
you only bet 10 francs !
i don't want to die for 10 francs !
it's now or never !
hold on !!!
way to go , karl !
we won !
are you sure?
i swear , you scared me to death !
i really thought you would rather die than lose .
between the tortoise and the hare it's always the tortoise that wins !
einstein !
you know " la fontaine "?
big hare not happy to been fucked by little tortoise .
cougar will be happy .
for a long time he's wanted to eat hare .
yes , big hare , big hare .
i'm sorry about the place .
it's not very romantic .
but i really wanted it .
oh really?
you really wanted ...
i didn't feel it .
should we try again?
no , later .
we've really got to go now .
daniel , what are you doing?
i've been looking for you for 15 minutes .
what were you doing in the dark?
photo finishing .
it's not the time for photo finishing .
the sergeant is waiting !
in the name of the president of the republic ... ... it is an honour to offer you the medal of the knight .
congratulations .
i owe you an apology .
for not believing in me , or for slapping me?
both .
how can you forgive me?
we'll find a way .
i read the story of your exploits .
amazing !
this experience made us think .
thank you .
we are going to change the way we see the road .
we are going to implement a police force more efficient and modern .
and all that thanks to you .
thank you .
this medal is only a symbol .
it won't give you your license back .
i was hoping for more ...
mercy?
exactly .
we've got mercy .
we've got enough to put you in jail for many years ... but you are free .
i'm not free , i can't drive .
i understand .
without a car , you are like an orphan .
yes , an orphan on foot .
i understand .
i got a solution but i'm not sure it will suit you .
tell me , and we'll see .
so?
are you happy?
yes .
you're not happy?
yes it's great .
i don't understand .
your first grand prix , pole position , a great car , friends ...
... your girlfriend .
what's wrong?
the sponsor !
we find him money , a car and he's still not happy .
tell the cheerleader to stop moving , it distracts me .
you know what you could do that would make me happy?
what?
win that race !
because we don't give a damn about the sponsors on the car .
ok then , take the champagne out of the freezer .
it's not good too cold .
let's go , daniel !
gosseyn subs .
revised jester .
