ladies and gentlemen , boys and girls and children of all ages .
what will they think of next?
see here .
a bitty bot , a tinkertoy , a living doll .
of course , we all know why they made him .
to steal your hearts , to replace your children .
this is the latest iteration in a series of insults to human dignity ... and in their grand scheme to phase out all of god's little children .
meet the next generation of child designed ... to do just that .
do not be fooled ... by the artistry of this creation .
no doubt there was talent in the crafting of this simulator .
yet with the very first strike ... you will see the big lie come apart before your very eyes !
don't burn me !
don't burn me !
i'm not pinocchio !
don't make me die !
i'm david !
i'm david !
i'm david !
mecha don't plead for their lives .
who is that?
he looks like a boy .
built like a boy to disarm us .
see how they try to imitate our emotions now?
i'm david !
we are only demolishing artificiality !
let he who is without sim ... cast the first stone .
oh , ho ho !
he's just a boy .
johnson , you're a monster !
let that boy go !
let him go !
get him out of there before they tear this place apart .
we found him .
where?
a flesh fair outside haddonfield .
is he alive?
yes .
he's in one piece .
i see the moon .
is it real?
i don't know , david .
i sit coming?
i can't tell yet .
let's not walk this way .
where are we going?
this way now .
are you in bad trouble?
have you run away from someone?
my mommy told me to run away .
why did she say that?
i guess ... because henry didn't like me .
why was that?
martin came home .
and who is he?
martin is mommy and henry's real son .
after i find the blue fairy , then i can go home .
mommy will love a real boy .
the blue fairy will make me into one .
is blue fairy mecha , orga , man or woman?
woman . ``woman "?
i know women !
# [ begins ]
they sometimes ask for me by name . # i'm in heaven # i know all about women .
as about as much as there is to know .
no two are ever alike .
and after they've met me , no two ... are ever the same .
and i know where most of them can be found .
where?
rouge city .
across the delaware .
too far for our feet .
we'll need help to get there .
# [ stops ]
and ... it is not without peril .
we will have to journey ...
towards the moon .
are there many women in rouge city?
as there are stars at night .
how will we find just one?
we will ask dr. know .
there is nothing he doesn't .
exactly what name do you give this woman?
she is ... just blue fairy .
blue fairy .
in the world of orga , blue is the color of melancholy .
yet , the services i provide will put a blush back on anyone's cheek .
i will change the color of your fairy for you .
she will scream out in the moonlight , ``oh !
oh , yes !
oh , god !
oh , yes !
oh , god !
oh , god !
she will make you a real boy , for i will make her a real woman .
and all will be right with the world because you held my hand ... and saved my brain , so that once again my customers may ask for me by name ``gigolo joe , what do ya know?
why do you do that?
that's just what i do .
now , follow me and don't fall behind .
all roads lead to rouge .
don't they say that , eh?
don't they just?
there are girls your age who are just like me .
we are the guiltless pleasures of the lonely human being .
you're not gonna get us pregnant or have us to supper with mommy and daddy .
we work under you , we work on you and we work for you .
man made us better at what we do than was ever humanly possible .
if you could manage us a lift to rouge city ,
all this ... [ giggling ]
and much , much more ... can be yours .
get in .
say ``ah .
ah .

i have to show you inside mildred .

that's our lady of the immaculate heart .
the ones who made us are always looking for the ones who made them .
they go in , fold their hands , look around their feet , sing songs ... and when they come out it's usually me they find .
i've picked up a lot of business on this spot .
# are the stars out tonight #
but, joe , where's blue fairy? # [ stops ]
that's what we're gonna find out when we ask dr. know .
that's where everyone goes who needs to know .
meet the good doctor .
starving minds , welcome to dr. know , where fast food for thought is served up 24 hours a day ... in 40, 000 locations nationwide .
ask dr. know .
there's nothing i don't .
tell me where i can find the blue fairy .
question me , you pay the fee .
two for five , you get one free .
he means two questions cost five new bucks with a third question on the house .
in this day and age , david , nothing costs more than information .
that's everything .
ten new bucks and a ten copper comes to ... seven questions for dr. know .
that should be enough .
he's a smooth operator .
he'll press our limits .
but try we must .
greetings , colleagues .
on offer , factual text or fictionalized text .
first or third person , literacy range from primal level to postdoctoral .
usual span of styles from fairy tale to religious .
who's who or where's where ... or flat fact .
flat fact?
thank you for question number one .
flat fact is a term demanding an equal answer
that shouldn't count .
that wasn't my question .
you must take care not to raise your voice up at the end of the sentence .
flat fact .
you have six more questions .
where is blue fairy?
in the garden .
vascostylis blue fairy .
blooms twice annually with bright blue flowers on a branched inflorescence .
a hybrid between ``ascola " meda arnold .
you have five more questions .
who is blue fairy?
are you sad , lonely , looking for a friend?
blue fairy escort service will find a mate for you .
you have four more questions .
joe?

what is blue fairy?
pinocchio , by carlo collodi . ``at this signal , there was a rustling as of flapping of wings ... ``and a large falcon flew to the windows ill . ``what are your orders , beautiful fairy? '
that's her . ``for you must know that the child with blue hair ... ``was no other than the good hearted fairy ... who had lived in that wood for more than a thousand
david !
david .
that's her !
it was an example of her .
but i think we're getting closer .
but if a fairy tale is real , then wouldn't it be fact a flat fact?
say no more .
new category , please .
combine ... fact with ...
fairy tale .
now ... ask him again .
how can the blue fairy ... make ... a robot ... into a real live boy?
come away , o human child , to the water sand the wild ... with a fairy hand in hand , for the world's more full of weeping than you can understand .
your quest will be perilous , yet there ward is beyond price .
in his book , how can a robot become human?
professor allen hobby writes of the power ... which will transform mecha into orga .
will you tell me how to find her?
discovery is quite possible .
our blue fairy does exist in one place , and in one place only .
at the end of the world where the lions weep .
here is the place dreams are born .
many a mecha has gone to the end of the world ... never to come back .
that is why they call the end of the world ``man hattan .
and that's why we must go there .
wait !
what if the blue fairy isn't real at all , david?
what if she's magic?
the supernatural is the hidden web that unites the universe .
orga believe what cannot be seen or measured .
it's that oddness that separates our species .
or what if the blue fairy is an electronic parasite ... that has a reason to haunt the minds of artificial intelligence?
they hate us , you know the humans .
they'll stop at nothing .
my mommy doesn't hate me ... because i'm special and unique .
because there has never been anyone like me before , ever .
mommy loves martin because he is real , and when i am real ...
mommy's going to read to me and tuck me in my bed and sing to me ... and listen to what i say and she will cuddle with me ... and tell me every day , a hundred times a day , that she loves me !
she loves what you do for her , as my customers love what it is i do for them .
but she does not love you , david .
she cannot love you .
you are neither flesh nor blood .
you are not a dog or a cat or a canary .
you were designed and built specific like the rest of us .
and you are alone now only because they tired of you ... or replaced you with a younger model ... or were displeased with something you said or broke .
they made us too smart , too quick and too many .
we are suffering for the mistakes they made because when the end comes , all that will be left is us .
that's why they hate us .
and that's why you must stay here ... with me .
good bye, joe .
stay back .
stay back .
let's clear this doorway , please .
you're in bad trouble .
go about your business now .
be careful , david .
this is not a toy .
destination?
manhattan .
mecha restricted area .
manhattan .
destination achieved .
the lost city in the sea at the end of the world .
where the lions weep .
turn around, joe .
we're not gonna give up yet , david .
turn around, joe .
turn all the way around .

``come away , o human child , to the waters and the wild ... ``with a fairy hand in hand , for the world's more full of weeping ... than you can understand .

professor hobby?
hello?
hello?
is this the place they make you real?
this is the place they make you read .
are you real?
i guess .
are you me?
i'm david .
you're not .
yes , i am .
i'm david .
so am i.
hello , david .
can you read?
can you sit down and we can read together?
let's be friends .
you can't have her .
i can't hear you .
she's mine .
and i'm the only one .
i'm david !
i'm david !
i'm david !
i'm david !
i'm david !
i'm david !
i'm david !
i'm david !
i'm special !
i'm unique !
i'm david !
you can't have her !
i'm david .
i'm david .
i'm david .
i'm david .
david?
i'm david .
yes , you are david .
professor hobby?
yes , david , i've been waiting for you .
dr. know told me you'd be here .
is blue fairy here too?
i first heard of your blue fairy from monica .
what did you believe the blue fairy could do for you?
she would make me a real boy .
but you are a real boy .
at least as real as i've ever made one , which by all reasonable accounts ... would make me your blue fairy .
you are not her .
dr. know told me that she would be here ... at the lost city in the sea at the end of the world
that's what dr. know needed to know to get you to come home to us .
and it's the only time we intervened the only help that we gave him ... to give toyou ...
so you could find your way home to us .
until you were born , robots didn't dream , robots didn't desire unless we told them what to want .
david , do you have any idea what a success story you've become?
you found a fairy tale ... and inspired by love , fueled by desire , you set out on a journey to make her real .
and most remarkable of all , no one taught you how .
we actually lost you for a while .
but when you were found again , we didn't make our presence known because our test was a simple one .
where would your self motivated reasoning take you?
to the logical conclusion ... that blue fairy is part of the great human flaw to wish for things that don't exist , or to the greatest single human gift the ability to chase down our dreams .
and that is something no machine has ever done until you .
i thought i was one of a kind .
my son was one of a kind .
you are the first of a kind .
david .
my brain is falling out .
would you like to come meet your real mothers and fathers?
the team is anxious to talk to you .
i want you to wait here .
i'll gather them up .
we want to hear everything about your adventures .
we want to thank you ... and tell you what's in store for you next .
mommy .
i saw it, joe .
i saw it the place where she lives .
she's right down there, joe .
she is?
she's waiting for me !
we have to go !
uh oh .
when you become a real boy , remember me to the ladies when you grow up .
good bye, joe .
good bye , david .
i am .
i was !
david , please , be careful .
the blue fairy's all right .
what happened?
i don't know .
we are in a cage .
blue fairy?
please .
please , please make me into a real , live boy .
please .
blue fairy?
please .
please .
make me real .
blue fairy , please .
please make me real .
please make me a real boy .
please , blue fairy .
make me into a real boy .
please .
and david continued to pray ... to the blue fairy there before him she who smiled softly forever , she who welcomed forever .
eventually , the flood lights dimmed and died , but david could still see her palely by day ... and he still addressed her in hope .
he prayed until all the sea anemones had shriveled and died .
he prayed as the ocean froze ... and the ice encased the caged amphibicopter and the blue fairy too ,
locking them together where he could still make her out .
a blue ghost in ice ... always there , always smiling , always awaiting him .
eventually , he never moved at all , but this eyes always stayed open ... staring a head forever all through the darkness of each night ... and the next day ... and the next day .
thus , 2, 000 years passed by .
teddy , we're home .
mommy !
mommy !
we're home !
where are you?
david .
david .
david .
david .
you have been searching for me , haven't you , david?
for my whole life .
and what , after all this time , have you come to ask me?
i have a wish to make .
and what is your wish?
please make me a real boy ... so my mommy will love me and let me stay with her .
david , i will do anything that is possible , but i cannot make you a real boy .
where am i?
this looks like my house , but it is different .
yes , it is different , but it's also your home .
we read your mind , and it's all here .
there's nothing too small that you didn't store for us to remember .
we so want you to be happy .
you are so important to us , david .
you are unique in all the world .
will mommy be coming home soon?
is she out shopping with martin now?
david , she can never come home ... because 2, 000 years have passed , and she is no longer living .
dearest david , when you are lonely , we can bring back other people from your time in the past .
if you can bring back other people , why can't you bring back her?
because we can only bring back people ... whose bodies we dig up from the ice .
we need some physical sample of the person ,
like a bone or a finger nail .
david?
yes , teddy?
do you remember when you cut some of mommy's hair?
henry shook me .
and you dropped her hair?
i know .
now you can bring her back , can't you?
give him what he wants .
dearest david , your wish is my command .
hey, joe , what do ya know?
david , i often felt a sort of envy of human beings ... of that thing they called ``spirit .
human beings had created a million explanations of the meaning of life ... in art , in poetry , in mathematical formulas .
certainly , human beings must be the key to the meaning of existence .
but human beings no longer existed .
so we began a project ... that would make it possible to recreate the living body of a person long dead ... from the d. n. a. in a fragment of bone or mummified skin .
we also wondered , would it be possible ... to retrieve a memory trace in resonance with a recreated body?
and you know what we found?
we found the very fabric of space time itself ... appeared to store information ... about every event which had ever occurred in the past .
but the experiment was a failure , for those who were resurrected only lived through a single day of renewed life .
when the resurrectees fell asleep on the night of their first new day , they died again .
as soon as they became unconscious , their very existence faded away into darkness .
so you see , david , the equations had shown that once an individual space time pathway had been used , it could not be reused .
if we bring mother back now , it will only be for one day , and then you will never be able to see her again .
maybe
maybe she will be special .
maybe she will stay .
i thought this would be hard for you to understand .
you were created to be so young .
maybe the one day will be like that one day inside the amphibicopter .
maybe it will last forever .
david , you are the enduring memory of the human race .
the most lasting proof of their genius .
we only want for your happiness .
david , you've had so little of that .
if you want for my happiness , then you know what you have to do .
listen .
can you hear that?
the new morning has come .
go to her , david .
she's just waking up this instant .
i found you .
hi .
hi .
i must have dozed off .
how long have i  would you like some coffee?
just the way you like it?
yeah , i'd love a coffee .
it'll wake me up .
okay .
you never forget how , do you?
no .
i never forget .
i must be a little confused .
what day is it?
it is ... today .
and as the day wore on ,
david thought it was the happiest day of his life .
all the problems seemed to have disappeared ... from his mommy's mind .
there was no henry , there was no martin , there was no grief .
there was only david .
david had been warned not to explain anything to monica .
otherwise , she would become frightened , and everything would be spoiled .
but david's journey home belonged only to him , so he didn't see the harm of painting her pictures of things ... she would have no memory of .
david had never had a birthday party because david had never been born , so they baked a cake and lit some candles .
now , make a wish .
it came true already .
by now , indeed , the windows were beginning to dim .
david drew the shades ... without even needing to be asked .
i really ought to be tucking you in .
how strange .
how fascinating .
i can hardly keep my eyes open .
i don't know what's come over me .
such a beautiful day .
i love you , david .
i do love you .
i have always loved you .
that was the ever lasting moment he had been waiting for .
and the moment had passed , for monica was sound a sleep .
more than merely a sleep .
should he shake her , she would never rouse .
so david went to sleep too .
and for the first time in his life , he went to that place ... where dreams are born .
