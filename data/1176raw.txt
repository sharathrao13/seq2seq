under power of the state , i am hereby authorized to put you ...
lee ray oliver , to death by lethal injection .
is there anything you'd like to say?
fuck you !
fuck every last one of you !
fuck you !
cover that up , please .
let's get the bag open .
thank you .
where am i?
you're in the county morgue .
i'm not dead .
the injections you got were all saltwater except the anesthetic .
what the fuck is going on?
you're getting an opportunity ... to be part of a medical research project .
if you agree to participate in the experiment ...
i'll take you toe tag here put it on that body over there .
he'll be cremated , you'll go on with these gentlemen .
if you don't agree the doctor will inject you with sodium pentathol ... and the execution will proceed right now in this room .
what kind of experiment?
it's a behaviour modifying drug trial .
who the fuck are you?
i'm a neuropharmacologist .
i'm involved in the research and development of new drugs .
i like drugs !
the drug we're going to give you ... is not a narcotic .
it won't give you narcotic sensations .
and there may be side effects .
some severe , possibly fatal .
you want me to be a guinea pig?
no , you'll be a test subject .
you have 1 minute to make your decision .
fuck you , warden !
proceed .
this is your last chance to do something good in your life .
a chance to give something back to society .
fuck society !
what the fuck has society ever done for me?
doctor !
just wait !
wherever we're going i hope it smells better that it did in there .
let's go .
you greedy fuck !
so now you see how it goes .
every time i say fuck ... he does that !
because you , warden ... have a lot of fucking nerve !
you thought you're gonna get another one , didn't you?
but i said fucking , not fuck .
please , stop !
didn't i pay you well ... to let my men go after lee ray in prison?
when lee ray offered him instead , did i complain?
no .
i didn't give a flying fuck !
i found out the state was gonna execute him .
so i am satisfied .
but now you tell me that lee ray is actually alive ... and that you will find out where he is ... if i pay you?
i'm sorry , i'll do it for free .
it's fair !
you'll find him , and we'll kill him .
third time's the charm , right?
yes , mr. vertov .
third time's the ...
don't fuck up !
you'll start off by taking one pill every six hours .
wait a fucking minute !
wait a minute .
what's this pill gonna do?
my name is dr. copeland .
i designed the medication you'll be taking .
it's called anagress .
it works by altering the brain's chemistry ... by suppressing your violent tendencies .
and with you aggression reduced ... you'll begin to experience feelings of good will and compassion ... a sense of right and wrong , even remorse over past mistakes .
good fucking luck .
this is the first time anagress ... has been tried on humans .
we don't know what the side effects are .
dry mouth , dizziness , nausea ... but there is a chance they could be more severe .
like what?
liver failure , brain seizures ... ... a stroke ...
whatever .
years ago , they might have given you a lobotomy ... carved out a piece of your brain like a rotten part of an apple .
but today we're more civilized .
we do it biochemically .
i rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy !
how long is your little experiment gonna last?
it's never over .
you and the other 19 test subjects ... will be observed indefinitely .
that 'one pill every six hours .
open wide .
let's go .
open back up .
smart man .
hey , michael !
how you doing?
good .
i'm doing good .
excellent .
is that austin?
he scored two goals in the first half .
he's getting real tall .
they grow up so fast , don't they?
ah , jeez !
i just came to see how the team was doing .
we're doing good .
it's not the same , but ...
no .
nothing is .
yes !
the guy seems a real teddy bear .
two days and not a peep .
i want blood , urine and saliva samples .
i have a pet scan and spect scheduled .
add a cerebral spinal fluid analysis .
yes , doctor .
mr. oliver ... we're going to remove your last restraint .
iwant you to relax .
i just died and live to talk about it .
it doesn't get more relaxed than this .
is it all right if i smoke in here?
we have a security breach .
i repeat , we have a security breach .
go !
we got him !
the man is a fucking animal .
he's perfect !
hey , aiku !
shit !
zone 8 activated .
zone 8 activated .
aiku !
hello .
there you are !
i've been looking for you everywhere .
you've changed the code again .
i'm sorry .
we agreed you were gonna call before you came by .
it's my weekend .
you knew i was coming by .
i forgot .
i'm sorry .
how unusual !
hello , aiku !
how are you?
what happened?
you look terrible !
it was a rough day at the office .
you look terrific , by the way .
i got a call from jenny .
she said you showed up at the soccer match .
that was fast !
she was worried about you .
and i'm worried about you too .
i just wanted do feel what it was like to ... be there again .
i hurt too , you know .
i know .
that's why i've gotta go .
i know that too .
come on .
time to go to mom's house .
next time i call before i come .
all right .
come on !
you never told me your ex was so beautiful .
how long have you been here?
not long .
i was just in the pool and i saw her drive up .
it wouldn't be a brilliant idea for me to be toweling off in the living room .
i went upstairs and hid in your closet .
how's your jaw?
the truth?
i'm gonna make you feel better .
make me forget everything .
can you do that for me?
i can try .
what the hell is going on?
take the pill first .
where's my hair?
where's my tattoos?
erased .
like your past .
in the next few weeks we'll be making changes on your outside ... while the medication changes you on the inside .
after what you guys did to me , you guys should be taking these pills !
ok , but you first .
attaboy .
the guy is pretty good .
beat my high score .
seratonine metabolate levels?
barely registering .
the guy is a textbook sociopath .
is it true he stabbed an inmate in the eye with a screwdriver?
yes .
he goes for the head .
increase game difficulty .
ok .
let's crank it up to mach 5 .
how'd he do with his mmpl?
just what you'd expect from ... a guy with antisocial personality disorder ... ... with psychotic tendencies .
and that's just for starters .
your fucking thing is rigged !
you can't hit a thing !
fuck !
this fucking thing is rigged !
get the fuck ...
get the fuck ... thing is rigged !
this thing is fucked up !
it's a broken machine !
get the fuck outta here !
fix your fucking machine !
there goes 1o grand .
take it out of my paycheck .
nikolai vertov .
27 years old .
do you ever feel bad about taking his life?
bad?
i feel really bad .
you do?
tell me .
if i'd known the motherfucker was the nephew of a russian mobster ...
i never would've robbed him , let alone put a bullet through his head .
manoel jose gutierrez .
you ever been in prison , doc?
let's not get distracted .
i didn't think so .
it's probably not what you're exactly used to .
the russian mobster took a contract out on me for killing his nephew .
gutierrez here tried to cash in on that contract .
i just defended myself .
you felt justified in ...
i felt fucking justified !
i don't give a fuck if you believe me or not !
that's what happened .
i got the jump on him , he's dead , i'm alive .
gary david caputo .
we got a minor bump .
he's alive .
just a little worse for wear .
tell me what happened with him .
just wrong place , wrong time .
it's not my problem .
you threatened to kill his brother for testifying at the trial .
is that true?
are we done?
this is getting boring .
you were 12 years old when your mother died?
you know exactly how old i was !
these files have discrepancies .
i just wanna make sure i get it right .
a former boyfriend killed her ... and you witnessed the murder .
is that true?
just give me the drugs and let's get on with it .
you never said anything about answering any of these questions !
just answer the question .
i'll answer whatever i want !
and don't you go talking to me like that .
i'm not your kid !
if you don't answer the question , you're of no use to me .
i'll transfer you back to the custody of the warden right now .
you are only alive because of me .
why don't you answer the questions , so i can help you?
i was 1o ... not 12 .
i was 1o .
thank you .
yes , i saw her thrashing around .
i saw the whole goddamn thing .
and then the fuck who killed her took a piss in front of me .
when you got to go ... you got to go " .
you wanna hear about what my uncle john used to do with me?
he had a little hobby that he called golf .
he used to beat me with his driver every tuesday night .
write that down .
why don't you write a fucking book about it?
all right , that's enough for today .
it is e fucking nough !
i'm everything you hate in the world , huh , doc?
he's more at ease .
much less agitated .
five of the rhesus monkeys showed results after only three doses .
when is his next pet scan?
" maana " .
let's do it now .
hey , doc !
how ya doin '?
i'm actually doing really good !
it's strange .
i feel ... different .
everything seems clearer , i feel less wound up .
good .
shit ... it really works .
we just got to do ...
come here !
everybody , get away !
nobody move !
back up !
i'm gonna stick this pen in his eye !
put the fucking guns down !
get away !
put it down !
so what he says !
put the gun down !
help me outta here , doc .
i will !
put'em down !
put the guns down !
get away !
put the guns down !
put it down !
i swear to fucking christ it's going in his eye !
tell him to put the gun down .
do as he says .
get outta here !
tell me how to get outta here !
tell me how to get outta here !
we'll take it from here .
get the fuck ... jeez ...
you're just as fucked up as i am , doc .
you got a fancy suit ...
you're just as fucked up as i am .
you're just as fucked up .
get off of me !
jesus , are you okay .
increase the dosage .
8 milligrams three times a day .
that's more than 3 times the previous .
just do it .
hart mercer pharmaceuticals ... dedicated to making the world a happier, healthier place .
now and in years ahead , we will continue our ...
you are too involved .
there's a reason why they ... don't want a primary researcher conducting his own clinical trial .
the man is out of control .
unsuitable .
we'll find another one .
we have to give him more time .
i'm increasing the dosage .
if you don't like it , you can hand my resignation in to the board .
be careful .
if one threatens to resign one time too many ... they get taken up on it .
and now , ladies and gentlemen , senior v. p. of research and development ...
dr. arlo penner .
thank you .
not too long ago , the acronym ssri was virtually unheard of .
now , of course , selective seratonin reuptake inhibitors ... help millions of people lead better lives .
today , as we speak ... a new class of pharmaceuticals is being developed ... that has the potential to change society as we know it .
as you're probably aware , the reason why hart mercer stock ... remains strong within this volatile market sector ... is largely because of dynax .
and i'm pleased to be able to announce to you that ...
dynax has once again been named ... as this year's most prescribed anti depressant .
so , on behalf of ... the board of directors and the shareholders of hart mercer ...
i wanna thank you , dr. michael copeland ... for your groundbreaking work which continues to this day .
congratulations , doctor .
thanks .
you look surprised to see me .
maybe a little .
did you forget that i'm a shareholder?
made us both rich .
as you keep climbing the ladder , don't forget to count the rungs .
remember when all we wanted was that one bedroom house?
with our very own washer and dryer .
and i was gonna open up a center ...
stop .
you're making me feel old .
how are you?
i'm good .
congratulations , doctor .
thanks .
barbara , this is eden ross .
she's a post doc .
part of the team .
nice to meet you .
my pleasure .
when i was an undergrad ...
i read your paper on the educational deficits effect on family violence .
it was really brilliant .
thanks .
now i officially do feel old .
next time invent a pill for that .
bye .
nice seeing ya .
bye .
so am i gonna see you tonight?
i hope so .
are you buying a car?
tuesday !
must be beef stew .
i wouldn't be too sure .
i'm sorry , lee ray .
it's all right .
it's cool .
no swat .
i'll get something to clean it up .
he didn't hit me .
i could've made that accident ... more natural .
this is very good , gentlemen .
i did a decent yago , senior year .
who the hell is yago?
we've got his mao level .
lambda k three is point one four .
this is your last chance to do something good in your life .
ok .
i'll be right there .
who was it?
security .
i'll go with you .
come on , man , just chill .
it's all right .
no , it's not .
i'm gonna be sick again .
take a deep breath .
what's going on?
what's going on?
i can see his face .
whose face?
gary caputo's .
wrong time , wrong place .
he was just standing on the stairs with a bag of groceries .
i should've just ran by , passed him and just gotten the hell outta there .
it's ok .
he was in a coma for seven months .
he had to learn to do everything all over again .
when i was in prison , i used to joke about him .
i used to brag about how i made the guy into a vegetable .
what's important is you know that what you did is wrong .
the treatment is working .
it's working .
why can't i sleep?
i wanna put my head on my pillow ... close my eyes and don's see his face anymore .
it's gonna be ok .
we'll give him somnubel .
5 milligrams .
brock , that's two tablets whenever he can't sleep .
ladies and gentlemen ... we've got remorse .
how can we be sure he's not faking again?
all of his biomarkers back it up .
ever since week 5 his serotonin and mao levels have improved ...
limbic and amygdale activity ... as well as bfs measures have responded in kind .
i think we're ready for phase 2 .
are you sure?
the board and i both believe that is ... absolutely your call .
but we all know the risks involved in moving forward too quickly .
it's going to work .
i think that we've uncreated a monster .
lot more cell phones !
tell me about it .
this thing is tight .
you'll get used to it .
the only way that truly gauge ... the effects of anagress is to observe you in the real world .
a controlled environment can only tell us so much .
i haven't been on the outside in a long time .
what if i fall on my ass?
you get back up .
this is it?
i thought you were made of money .
beats your last address .
that's fine , guys .
thanks .
let's do it again .
what's your name?
joe monroe .
and what have you been doing for the last 5 years?
working in cincinnati , ohio , in a packaging plant .
loading boxes in a warehouse .
good .
here's 3oo bucks and an id to get you started .
and then what?
another 3oo next week .
you're on your own .
it's nice .
there's nothing in the fridge !
guess you'd better go to the store .
something wrong?
no , just looking at the view .
all right .
i'll let you get settled .
he hasn't stabbed anybody in the eye yet .
so , that's a start .
eden , i want a seratonin metabolite analysis .
attaboy !
tracking okay?
we're on .
oh , man , he's oh for eight .
what we'll do if no one will hire him?
the question is , what he'll do?
he's into current events now?
he's checking out the classifieds .
impressive !
yeah , sully .
sully from inside .
he told me to call you .
25o is all i can spare , you understand?
why?
'cause i gotta buy groceries .
sully , yes .

i'm the one who makes the phone calls .

you sound like someone i knew .
i think he's dead .
some son of a bitch he was .
i guess he can be me then .
what's he doing?
looking for us .
i'd say that lee ray just took the hidden out of hidden camera .
nightmares again?
can't give you any more .
doc said two pills a night , max .
did you ever try these things?
nah .
soon as i hit the bed , i'm out .
my daddy used to say that ... an honest man's pillow is his peace of mind .
wanna play cards?
it's gonna take 2o minutes for these things to kick in .
i'm not supposed to do anything that could affect your environment .
winning a hand of cards is really gonna affect my life !
come on , i've got this kick ass root beer here .
you won't let me have any alcohol , so i sprang for the good stuff .
all right , but then i'm out the door .
cheers .
how long have you been working with theses guys?
three years this month .
i used to be a cop in detroit ... but this is much better .
i'm not even supposed to talk to you .
i gotta go .

no , take it with you .
it's fine .
thanks , man .

the blue line for davenport now boarding on track 4 .
dr. copeland?
it's norton .
we've lost him .
the train is bound to davenport .
we got him on gps .
this piece of shit has been playing a big con on us all along .
that's not possible .
what the hell's he doing in davenport?
shit .
that's where gary caputo lives .
the guy lee ray shot in the stairwell?
and his brother that testified against lee ray lives there too .
bill's not here !
gary?
bill's not here .
i'm not looking for bill .
i came here to see you .
i like this commercial .
who are you?
my name is joe .
i don't know anyone named joe .
i'm a new friend .
i wanna tell you something .
long time ago , somebody hurt you .
really bad .
they hurt you really bad .
and they want me to tell you they were really sorry for what they did .
they're really sorry for hurting you .
it's okay .
no , it's not .
no , it's not .
here .
i got you something .
i got you some stuff .
here .
i don't know what you like so i got you what i like .
i'm not supposed to eat too much candy .
look at this .
but i do .
listen to me , anything that you want ... if you wanna go see a movie , go to the park ... whatever you want , you tell me .
i'll see you again soon .
was that guy in here?
he's my friend .
what do you mean?
he's gonna take me to a movie .
what?
what's his name?
i forget .
you fucking forget everything !
where do i know that guy?
you gotta sign the check again .
here !
what do i write?
jesus christ ... do we have to go over this every goddamn month?
write pay to the order of william caputo and then you sign it .
i should blow your fucking brains out .
you and dimi vertov .
he sent you , didn't he?
you're lucky i'm gonna give you another chance .
leave me alone .
you tell him to leave me alone .
you understand?
i'm a different person now .
it's over .
turn the fuck over .
you count to 5oo .
if i see a fucking eyebrow twitch , you're dead !
don't move , asshole !
move a muscle , you'll be nothing but a bloodstain .
ya think we weren't gonna catch up with you?
what the hell were you thinking?
i needed to see gary .
to apologize .
i was coming back .
brock is okay?
brock is unemployed .
it wasn't his fault .
i had to go see gary .
i can't sleep .
i had to see gary .
i was coming back .
here's his train ticket , doc .
round trip .
you were really coming back?
what else am i gonna go?
you gotta give him his job back .
it wasn't his fault !
i bet you want him back .
lf anyone figures out who you are ... if anyone knows you're alive , the deal is off and it's back to the warden .
you understand that , don't you?
can i have a pill , please?
couldn't be !
was this the guy who that in here?
they showed that commercial again .
and you missed it .
the man had a return ticket , for god's sakes !
what he did today was an act of contrition .
12 weeks ago , he had no remorse ... and now he's risking his life to apologize !
the man is a murderer .
he was a murderer .
you put a guard in his room , it'll influence his behaviour .
you can't do it !
if anything were happen , we're responsible .
hart mercer pharmaceuticals !
i'll give you one more chance ... then we move on to a different test subject .
period .
end of discussion .
arlo ... is there something i should know about the other test subjects?
i've told you .
any knowledge of their status ... could influence your interaction with your own subject .
yes , but i heard a rumour from one of the post docs .
some of the test subjects have died of liver failure .
if it's true , i should know .
has your subject shown signs of liver damage?
no , he hasn't .
the most significant side effects are insomnia , dry mouth ... persistent feelings of guilt and remorse .
nothing here about liver complications .
you don't need to concern yourself with the other subjects .
you have enough on you hands as it is .
you shouldn't spend so much time listening to post docs .
especially the attractive ones .
you don't like relish much , do you?
trying to eat more vegetables .
so what's cincinnati like?
they got a baseball team .
i guess you don't miss it much .
i just wanted to start from scratch .
me too .
it's a beautiful thing , isn't it?
what's that?
starting from scratch .
i hear you .
ralph says you're doing really good .
he says you caught on quick .
it's not too much to catch on to .
you want some dessert or ...
they got a really good ice cream sandwich .
come on , i owe you !
you don't owe me anything .
i owe you .
fairly smooth .
what are you reading?
introduction to geology .
it's a real page turner .
you go to school?
community college , nights .
it's my second semester .
keeps me busy .
i knew you had brains .
if had brains , would i be working here?
come on !
you ever been inside?
inside what?
come on .
do you do this very often?
i don't know .
for some reason i find it to be relaxing .
it is .
for a couple of minutes ...
i feel i can think .
i guess i can see that .
only thing is , you have to haul ass before ralph sees you .
you get a thing?
teresa ...
what are you thinking?
guess .
jump !
did he see us?
i almost tripped over my foot .
haven't seen him .
he looks different now .
he doesn't have them scars .
he was in here 2 days ago .
it's on the receipt .
we get a lot of people in here every day .
you should check the neighborhood .
maybe he lives around here .
thanks .
hop in .
i'll give you a ride to your place .
never get attached to you lab rat .
thanks , doc .
let's go .
thanks for the lift .
sure .
put on your belt .
check those books out?
i stole them .
had to pop a couple librarians to make me getaway .
nice .
this is a sweet ride .
i drove one of these on the car wash .
i only drive like 1o feet but ...
you got a family , doc?
that's none of your business .
i was just curious .
i was just wondering if you had a family .
it's inappropriate for you to ask me personal questions .
but it's okay for you to know everything about me .
i see how it works .
just curious .
what?
come on .
i wanna know .
my wife and i have split up .
and we had a son .
is he living with her?
no , he was killed .
accident?
was he sick or ...
murder .
he was 8 years old .
we were driving home from the park after shooting hoops ...
like we did on every saturday when i could get away from work ... and a car cut us off .
i laid on the horn , changed lanes .
he cut me off again and i lost it .
i flipped him the bird and start screaming and the next thing i know ... the guy shoots at me with a gun .
the windshield shatters .
i pull over , turn ...
tommy's slumped over covered in blood .
it's gonna be okay , daddy .
i'm gonna be okay .
and then he died .
i'm sorry , doc .
if that guy had been on anagress , maybe my son'd be alive today .
if i had been on anagress maybe ...
you can just drop me off here .
i'll walk the rest of the way .
thanks for the lift .
there you go .
i have a date tomorrow night .
really?
good for you .
that's great .
this thing around my ankle ...
it stays where it is .
come on !
what if i get lucky?
you're gonna have to figure out a way to keep your pants on .
come on , doc !
sorry , pal .
i can't help you .
i'm not gonna run , i swear !
i like the way things are right now .
i'm not gonna run .
i know , i believe you but ...
i got rules to follow too .
borrow the car?
have a good time .
thanks for the ride .
sure .
be well , joe .
they didn't change a thing .
can you tell me what's going on?
what do you mean?
i haven't had dinner with you since ...
i can remember ... even when we were still together ...
friday's?
i thought it was in the off limits category .
we only came here because ...
tommy liked it so much .
what can i tell you?
i'm jonesing for a number 3 with hickory sauce .
i'm surprised they let us back in here .
i don't think they recognized us .
how could they forget?
the flames almost touched the ceiling .
how could they forget ... how you tried to douse the flames with your milkshake?
who was the genius who left his menu on a smoking toaster?
it's a stupid place to put a toaster !
we both panicked .
only tommy stayed calm .
just unplugged it and got the manager .
that's the first time i've heard you say his name since ...
i brought the papers for the lake house .
we got a pretty good price .
it will be divided fifty fifty ... as per our very amicable divorce agreement .
right here .
i've cashed in my stock options .
really?
hart mercer not seem like a good investment all of a sudden?
no , but i'm buying an old school building downtown .
it's a major fizer upper but my accountant says that real state ... is less risky than biotech these days , so ...
true .
i'm gonna open up that youth center i was always talking about .
at least , i'm gonna try anyway .
you'll do it .
barbara , that's great .
i thing that's really great .
you know that colleague you introduce me to?
she's very pretty .
reminds me a bit of me when i was that age .
you were prettier .
and a bit smarter .
you look nice .
whatever .
whatever .
come on .
you know this guy?
can't say i do , mister .
ugly son of a bitch , ain't he?
look closer .
he's different now .
no scars .
he changed his face , but's still him .
you do know him , don't you?
he just drove out of here with that girl .
why are you looking for him?
do he owe you money?
then what'd he do?
for starters ... he shot my brother in the head .
this is really cool !
i can't believe you've never been to an amusement park before .
when i was a kid , a sandbox was a big deal .
want a beer?
no .
sure?
i'm 1o months sober .
really?
can't picture you a big drinker .
drinking wasn't really my thing .
i dated this guy , and he was a dealer .
i ended up doing speed with him 'til it got out of control .
i was down to 95 pounds by the time i hit rehab .
too much information at once , huh?
at least you got out .
you got yourself a second chance .
i had to .
i see it like this ... keep one eye in the past and one eye in the future ... you end up cross eyed .
so i'm thinking about right now .
and right now ...
i'm happy .
i'm having fun .
me too .
i got an idea .
come on .
i still think we should go in .
give him some space .
he's gotta come out the same way he went in .
lee ray !
you're very aggressive out there .
it's better than crashing real cars .
that's true .
you wanna try the merry go round?
i'm a merry go round freak .
really?
sure .
doesn't make you dizzy .
i gotta go to the bathroom .
i'll be right back .
you don't mind i go on ...
no .
i'll be right back .
get out of the way !
you there !
stop !
did i miss anything?
nothing much .
it was a tight race but i won by a nose .
what took you so long?
long line .
ready?
so ... you want me to drop you off?
i'll walk home from you apartment .
make sure you get home safe .
what?
wanna make sure i get home safe?
i was gonna invite you in , anyway .
you got a nice apartment .
welcome to my palace , darling .
the maid's quarters are downstairs .
and it's the butler's day off .
hope you don't mind .
you probably wanted to stay at the park longer .
i'm sorry .
i hope i didn't mess things up .
don't worry about it .
can't be a kid forever .
joe ...
i've trusted a lot of people in my life .
i was wondering if ...
i can trust you .
there's something i should tell you though .
great .
i've heard that before .
no , it's not that .
i'm on this medicine ... these pills ... that make you ... calm or something .
what happens when you don't take them?
you wouldn't wanna know me .
whatever it is they're doing , it's working .
i should probably go .
what's wrong?
nothing .
i just wanna have something to look forward to .
right .
a guy who didn't want to jump my bones on the first date .
i can trust you .
i had a great time tonight .
me too .
something to look forward to .
i'm gonna regret having said that .
i'll see you tomorrow?
i thought he was gonna get lucky .
tough break .
just in time .
he's overdue for his anagress .
shit !
there's nowhere to park .
drive around the block we'll find another one .
got ya , motherfucker !
drop the gun !
dammit !
shit !
what's up with this asshole?
my god !
my god !
shit !
tell me you're not gonna get that .
hello?
ok .
i'll be right there .
let's go .
no , you can't .
why?
it might be dangerous .
if you're not gonna let me go with you ...
i'm not gonna stay here by myself .
he ditched it in the trash bin .
i just can't believe that he ...
don't you see how he played you?
he's a sociopath .
you should've known better .
those bastards can fool ... polygraph machines .
what made you think he couldn't fool you?
i don't know .
he's in a black pickup with flame decals .
make sure he doesn't go far .
you're authorized to terminate .
what's that supposed to mean?
you know the protocol .
if the subject commits a violent crime ... during phase 2 , there's no alternative .
he's already dead in the eyes of the law .
and that justifies us hunting him down and killing him?
goddamn right , it does .
we'll do an autopsy and figure out what happened with the anagress .
go to the lab .
make the necessary adjustments .
you'll be back on track in no time .
come on !
get up !
right here .
you can get rid of all those scars .
you still got the same evil eyes .
so , what'd you do?
pay off the doctor?
the warden?
where'd a low life like you get the money to fake an execution?
i'm sorry about gary ...
that just wraps everything up .
right , gary?
fuckhead here says he's sorry .
he's my friend .
he's your friend , huh?
we're going to the movies .
you're going to the movies together?
is that right?
you're good friends?
tell my brother what a good friend you are !
i'm sorry ...
shut up !
shut the fuck up with sorry !
i saw you snickering with that lawyer .
you didn't have an ounce of remorse .
tell my brother what you did to him .
gary ... your friend wants to tell you exactly what he did to you .
he gave me candy .
tell him .
i didn't tell you the truth about someone else hurting you .
i did it .
tell him what you did !
i shot you in the head .
i shot you .
i'm really sorry , gary .
shut up !
fucking sorry .
i could've had a life if it wasn't for you .
instead i had to take care of my fucking brother all the time !
lf i could trade places with him ...
shut up !
look at me .
fuck you !
he's my friend !
don't !
go !
go !
get off !
get the fuck off me , gary !
get those monitors packed up .
copeland .
doctor , i need my medicine .

did norton make it?
you shot him in the heart .
of course he didn't make it .
he's dead !
i didn't shoot him !
don't lie to me !
i'm not lying !
bill caputo shot him .
he recognized me when i went to see gary !
he just kidnapped me and tried to kill me !
why the hell should i believe you?
do you think i'd kill norton?
after all this , do you thing i'd do that?
they must've seen his car .
caputo took me in his truck .
your guys must have seen it .
have them check it out .
you gotta believe .
just come and get me .
come and give me my medicine .
where are you?
where's the fire?
maybe we better find out .
shit !
i need help .
you want the emergency room .
i need anagress .
never heard of it .
do you have a prescription?
give me something to mellow me out !
what do you got?
don't hurt me , man !
come here .
where are you going?
teresa?
i need your help .
are you there?
i need your help .
i'm in trouble .
please , let me in .
teresa , please , come to the door .
god !
teresa?
let me in .
i'm in trouble ...
ralph called .
he said somebody came to see him .
they said you were a killer .
that your name is lee ray .
is that true?
is it true?
i was ...
please , don't do this to me .
i was lee ray .
i'm a different person now .
i'm not who i was .
i can't be who i was .
please , they're coming after me .
don't do this to me .
it's the cops , isn't it?
no , they're not the cops .
jesus !
if you don't let me in , they're gonna kill me .
teresa , please !
open up !
we're here for joe monroe .
who?
go !
i got here as fast as i could .
what happened?
it's all gone to shit .
what do you mean?
i keep on asking myself ... am i arrogant or i was just stupid?
i had such hopes for anagress ...
i need my pills .
now !
what's going on?
everything is gonna be fine .
it's not gonna be fine until i get my pill .
you got them?
get them !
not until she leaves .
she's not going anywhere .
i know you didn't kill norton .
that was bill caputo's truck , just like you said .
and i know what kind of person you are .
and you gonna let her go 'cause she has nothing to do with this .
barbara , go .
do not call the police or i'll be in trouble .
just go .
it's gonna be fine , joe .
i want everything back the way it was .
please , give me my pills .
the pills are in my office .
this isn't enough .
what am i supposed to do when this runs out?
eden ross .
hi, it's me .
i need you to do something for me .
now you need my help?
please , this is important .
take all the anagress we have and bring it to my house .
can you do that?
okay .
and don't tell anyone .
was that him?
what'd he want?
he wants me to bring the lab supply of anagress to his house .
well done .
it's my job .
she'll be here in half an hour .
thanks .
what's happening?
did you hear anything?
where is he?
what?
eden said you asked her to bring anagress to your house .
i tried to warn you .
post docs , they always put their careers first .
where is he?
i don't know .
he called one hour ago ... but wouldn't say where he was .
just wanted his pills .
he didn't kill norton .
bill caputo did .
it was bill caputo's truck they saw driving away .
joe monroe doesn't have to die .
the anagress works .
all we have to do is get him back on the medication .
anagress doesn't work .
anagress does work .
doesn't work !
all the subjects who took anagress are dead .
their livers shut down after six weeks .
he's fine .
he was on a placebo .
he was part of the control group .
he was getting nothing but sugar pills .
if he was taking the actual medicine , he'd be dead right now .
but ... that's not possible .
you knew there was a chance he'd be in the control group .
yes , but his biomarkers , his seratonin levels ... scientifically ...
never underestimate the power of the placebo effect .
people have cured themselves from every disease known to science .
eradicated tumors , for chrissakes !
but eventually the placebo effect dies .
i need a drink .
anybody want a drink?
hello?
michael , is he still in the house?
no , he's outside .
he crapped all over the floor .
i think he's got worms .
i'm keeping him outside .
does he still have a gun?
no, but the vet should check him out .
he'll be ready when you get here .
i'm calling the police .
i got to go now .
i'm expecting a work call .
ok .
bye .
that was barbara .
i call her whenever the dog is sick .
you know how she is .
are you still seeing her?
i always liked barbara .
no , we just share custody of the dog .
you sure you don't want a drink?
'cause i need one .
maybe i'll have a drink .
shit !
you can get yourself killed for doing this .
nobody is gonna get killed .
gonna get you to the airport .
put you on the next flight out .
i don't have enough pills .
you don't need any pills .
what are you talking about?
you don't need them .
they were nothing but sugar .
what?
they didn't do a damn thing .
son of a bitch !
the placebo .
you were in the control group .
that's bullshit !
no .
i never lied to you and i'm not lying to you now .
he's headed forthe lake .
we got him .
you know what to do .
you knew this the whole time?
it would've affected how i treated you .
i just found out tonight , i swear .
you knew theses things weren't real?
they were real to you , and that's what matters .
you okay?
you gotta get outta here .
get to the airport anyway you can .
here's some money .
disappear .
go .
that was you , doc .
what?
you're the reason why i got better .
it wasn't any drug .
you changed yourself .
now hurry !
go !
go !
you gotta go .
what do you think of it so far?
it's okay .
let's have a look outside .
beautiful !
wayne , this is michael .
how you doing , wayne?
good .
you wanna meet the other guys?
come on .
all right , rhonda , time to play a real master .
i want you to meet wayne !
