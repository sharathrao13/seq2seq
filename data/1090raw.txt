i want you to go back to collinwood .
find someone to take the rap for this car fiasco for me .
i'll pay 15 grand .
fifteen grand?
where are you gonna get 15 grand?
from a shoebox .
what shoebox?
it's under my bed .
you said we couldn't get married , because you were broke .
you lied to me , you son of a bitch .
of all the shit you've put me through .
if we'd used that money , i'm stuck in here .
you want that?
you want me in jail?
no .
no .
i want you to buy me a ring .
all right .
listen to what i'm saying .
i heard about a job in here .
the greatest job i've ever heard of .
it'll give us all the money we could ever use for the rest of our lives .
if i get you a mullinski , will you marry me?
will you?
all right !
all right !
on my mother .
all right .
i'll get you a mullinski .
who is it?
it's rosalind , toto .
open up .
toto no here !
no toto .
how'd you find me?
this is where you live?
well , how do you know?
it's me , rosalind .
cosimo's woman .
sweet jesus .
he gave me up , didn't he?
i tried to get him out of that car .
i swear to god !
relax , old man .
he didn't give you up .
he needs your help .
how can i help?
i'm like a caged animal !
all day , cops everywhere .
i don't eat or sleep .
the cops can only get you through cosimo , and he'd never give you up .
but you've gotta help .
he needs a mullinski .
i can't mullinski for him .
i already did .
the judge would lock us both up !
no .
he needs you to find a mullinski .
the offer's 15 grand .
fifteen .
i spent a year in isolation for him , he only gave me five .
yeah , well , somebody told him about a job in there .
a job?
what kind of job?
can i trust you?
he says it could be his bellini .
fifteen for a mullinski?
yeah .
what's the charge?
grand theft auto .
shit , forget it .
i can't do it .
what are you talking about?
grand theft's easy , i did it .
it's not the time .
it's my mother .
she'd die on the spot .
well , she'd die happier knowing you had 15 grand in your pocket .
what are you , sick?
forget it .
i'm not doing it .
look , you're gonna turn down 15 grand for a mullinski?
what do you want from me?
i told you , i can't do it .
let cosimo rot .
he's the biggest asshole in collinwood .
look , swear you'll never repeat this .
what?
swear .
cosimo will kill me if he ever finds out i told you .
come on .
all right , i swear .
cosimo , he's got this big job lined up .
big?
how big?
huge .
all that's huge about cosimo is his fat head .
he says it's his bellini .
his bellini .
everybody in this neighborhood's got a bellini .
hey , mickey .
what's up?
how's your bellini?
watch your mouth .
no .
cosimo's ...
cosimo's is real .
a lifer gave it up to him in the joint .
that's why he's so desperate to find a mullinski .
a lifer gave it up to him?
you see , i figure ... ... if we help cosimo get out , maybe we can get in on some of the action .
how much action?
cosimo says 300 grand .
holy shit .
yeah .
i know .
i don't know .
look .
how much money did you wake up with in your pocket this morning?
fifty five cents .
what have you got to lose?
do you know leon?
that negro who hides his sister?
he's a nut case , but he always needs dough .
i can't do it .
my sister's engaged to be married .
jesus .
this will pay for the wedding .
this is 10 grand we're talking about .
fianc's a snob from the suburbs .
if i go to the pen , there'd be no wedding .
this is crazy .
how hard can it be to find a mullinski?
you gotta know somebody that could use the dough .
friends who'd be better off in jail .
what the fuck does that mean?
it means what it means .
screw cosimo .
why give a shit?
he's the biggest asshole in collinwood .
yeah , but he's got a bellini .
what are you doing to me?
you wanna find a mullinski?
every sucker's got a bellini .
this one's legit .
a lifer gave it up to him .
anybody who helps can get a piece of the action .
why didn't the lifer pull it?
because he's a lifer .
he went to the pen before he could .
a genuine bellini?
you swear on your mother?
i swear on my mother .
goddamn .
you fellows know riley?
what the fuck are you doing?
i just got the baby to sleep after three hours .
i'm sorry .
it's all right .
it's all right .
it's just ...
he's very neurotic .
noises ... ... and bright lights upset him terribly .
i'm sorry .
if you're here for pictures , i'm out of the business .
my wife's in the pen .
i had to sell my cameras to buy diapers and baby food .
but if you're interested ... ... i'm selling drinking glasses .
i paint them .
they're all hand painted .
by me .
if you're interested .
sweet jesus , i am so broke .
funny you should mention that .
you got a job?
cosimo needs a mullinski .
he's willing to pay 10 large for it .
ten large?
that's two bucks a jar .
i can't .
it's impossible .
i got the kid , for chrissake .
where's your wife?
seneca .
they gave her a year for fraud .
even with a newborn .
they set her fine at 1000 bucks .
christ .
we're so broke , she had to do the time .
a year for 1000 bucks .
i know .
you know , they've got a fabulous nursery at seneca .
i was born there .
we're in a real pickle .
we need a mullinski .
we need one fast .
you're not gonna ...
you're not gonna get an ex con for grand theft auto .
you need somebody with a clean record so the judge'll go easy on him .
jesus , it's not like the old days anymore .
you guys know pero?
baby coming through .
baby coming through .
baby coming through .
baby fucking coming through .
here , let's put this on you .
are you out of your lunatic mind?
what?
cosimo won't share his job with them .
it was an accident .
i was talking , my mouth slipped .
he's gonna kill me for this .
he's gonna kill me .
i'm not going to prison for that fool .
not even for 15 grand?
you told us 10 .
my boxing career's about to take off .
you're fighting a priest .
a tough priest .
you rather i fight a woman?
tonight , i fight a priest .
tomorrow , i fight for the championship .
this jackass is our last chance .
maybe sweeten the deal .
he's this close .
i say we go equal parts on another 1000 .
a thousand dollars would get my wife out .
what is it with you guys?
you gotta spend money to make money .
man , she's right .
if we don't spring cosimo , there's no job .
we'll go 16, 000 on the deal .
i don't need it .
when my career takes off , i'm spinning on this neighborhood .
mahlovic , you're up !
let's go .
all right .
see you after the fight .
pero , buma ye !
i'm so pretty .
i'm so pretty .
come on !
cosimo cosanawowski , for attempted grand theft auto , you are sentenced to ...
stop the proceedings !
stop !
order .
order .
hold on !
hear me out .
hear me out .
remove him .
please , your honor , i'm here to confess .
that man is innocent .
your honor , i can no longer live with the guilt .
it was me who was stealing that car .
i confess .
my brother cosimo , saint cosimo , as he's known on the streets ... ... was only trying to stop me .
cosimo , i mean to steal this car .
i am a car thief .
i steal cars .
by myself .
i'm gonna kill you !
wait .
hold on .
you're the worst mullinski ever .
not only that , you added six months .
six months to my sentence .
six months .
six months .
who cares about six months?
i just got three fucking years , man !
i want my money back .
otherwise , you're gonna die in this prison .
get out .
fine .
i don't care .
i don't care about anything anymore .
what's the matter with you?
come on .
prison is easy , you puss .
no .
you don't understand .
i betrayed my brother .
maybe he deserved it .
he's dying , you jackass !
my real brother , bleeko , is dying .
now he'll have to die alone .
just last week he said to me ...
he said , " pero , be there for me in the final moments ... ... when death has me in its deadly grip .
don't let me go it alone .
i swore to him i wouldn't , but i betrayed him .
for a lousy 16 grand .
you're a sick bastard .
no , i'm not laughing at you .
i'm laughing at ...
you wanna hear something gonna cheer you up?
you know that old building on chester avenue?
there's a million old buildings .
the factory with the gold brick .
what about it?
it's not a flour factory anymore .
half became apartments .
guess what's on the other half?
i don't care .
a jewelry shylock .
so what?
so my cellmate , the bricklayer , he split the building .
he pulled a krazner .
what?
you know , a krazner .
he mortared the wall between the apartment and the shylock ... ... with sand and water .
you can push through it .
shylock's a big shot .
the bricklayer said he has a fortune in that safe .
you still have to break into the apartment .
that's the beauty of it .
nobody lives there .
it's vacant .
you can walk in .
you're a bigger jackass than everyone says .
what are you talking about?
lf this job is so good ... ... why didn't the old man pull it himself .
two days before the job , he fights with his wife .
shoots her dead .
he's a lifer now , so he gave me the job .
you were to spring me so i could pull it .
now we're in the can together .
funny shit , huh?
yeah , it is .
i mean , really funny , right?
you have no idea .
you're free to go .
thanks .
where's he going?
you told me you had three years .
you know , i did , but the judge suspended the sentence .
i'm gonna fucking kill you !
you son of a bitch .
your mother's a whore .
my mother's a what?
a whore !
your mother's a whore !
goddamn !
shit .
come to see me home?
i want the money back .
i did my job , baby .
it's not my fault the judge didn't buy it .
i'm dead if i don't get that money .
look who flew the coop .
if it isn't a $ 16, 000 man .
we don't care what went wrong .
we just want our stake in the money back .
what's the fuck's the matter with you people?
that money's mine .
we don't want trouble .
you want me to take it out of your ass?
fuck you !
you want more , funny boy?
christ .
where's the money?
i don't have it .
well , you better find it .
jesus christ !
just give us the money .
i gave the money to my debtors .
all 16, 000?
i still owe another 5 to leo the lip .
he's lying .
wait , wait .
i got the bellini .
i got cosimo's bellini .
bullshit .
stick him again .
i swear to god !
i told him i got three years , and he gave it up to me .
so what?
so i'll cut you in on it .
equal shares .
all of you .
it's the greatest job i ever heard of .
a jewelry shylock .
let's hear it then .
i can't breathe .
let him up .
let him up .
you watch yourself , fucker .
fuck .
i feel weak .
shit .
jesus , we killed him .
the safe's on the second floor of the pawnshop .
the apartment next to the pawnshop is empty .
we break into the apartment , smash a hole in the wall ... ... climb into the shylock's and crack the safe .
that's the easy part .
trouble is that building's like a fortress .
the front door's alarmed .
the best way is through the coal chute next door .
take the back fire escape to the roof .
then we drop to the apartment window , and we cut it open .
anybody know a safecracker?
jerzy antwerp is the only one i know .
wait a minute .
hold him , would you?
i got an idea .
i was thinking , with a camera , i could shoot the shylock opening the safe .
we could get the combination .
brilliant .
where we gonna get a camera?
we could pay a little visit to a guy i know at the flea market .
so , what are you hocking today , riley?
your kid?
treat me with more respect .
it just so happens i came into some money .
i'm a buyer today .
it's nice .
i like the browns .
yes , but what about the reds?
what do you think?
it's for my sister .
is there too much red?
she's been institutionalized , and the color red makes her bark like a dog .
yes , after all , i believe there is too much red .
i'm sorry , oswald , but your paintings are crap .
let's go to sears .
okay .
here we go .
what is this?
sorry .
i shot some footage of him for his mom .
he's a cute baby .
that's his new food .
he's not taking to it too well .
i like it .
riley , come on .
it's good food .
you're killing me .
here we go .
the hassenfeffer 622 .
is that good or bad?
neither .
okay , okay , watch this .
seventy eight .
seventy seven .
eight .
seventy eight .
eight .
whoa .
jesus christ .
seventy seven .
what's that number?
seventy eight .
what is the number?
it's an eight .
seventy eight , eight .
that's great .
we did nine takes .
every time , on the last number , he does this .
he's like a gimp .
sorry .
so , what do you think?
well , as a film , it's a disaster .
it's a documentary .
it's supposed to look like that .
the good news is , the safe is crackable .
so how do we ...?
what do we ...?
how do we do this?
do i carry you on my back?
this may be a shock , but i don't go out in the field anymore .
see .
what the hell's he doing here?
i teach .
for 500 bucks , i show you how to do it .
500 bucks?
500 bucks?
be quiet .
the baby .
we're all tapped out here .
that's why we're doing this job in the first place .
we'll cut you in .
i don't take back end money .
there's a fortune in that safe .
five hundred bucks , that's a deal .
my time is valuable .
all right .
hold on .
hold your horses .
can you get us through a krazner wall?
well , who do you think krazner called?
all right .
so then it's a deal .
good .
be at my place saturday afternoon .
if you'll excuse me , i have a class to teach in youngstown .
five hundred bucks?
did i mention i'm trying to get my wife out of the clink?
where can we get that kind of money?
we could mug someone .
there's gotta be something .
i think i can get the money .
how much do you need?
just a small loan for a new suit .
i met a nice girl .
i'm gonna ask her to marry me .
you're getting married?
lf she says yes .
so how much?
five hundred dollars .
five hundred dollars?
it must be some suit .
it's beautiful .
with buttons and shoes .
well , i hope she can make an honest man out of you .
at the usual interest?
at the usual interest .
we're still better than leo the lip .
there are many methods to cracking a safe .
each method has an inverse relationship between quickness and cleanness .
the quickest is lipchiski method , named for its originator , theodore lipchiski .
the lipchiski method requires a stick of dynamite and a match .
very quick .
but as we learned when lipchiski blew himself up in toledo , it's not clean .
hence , i teach the circular saw method .
not the quickest , but the cleanest .
you and your loot will emerge unharmed .
this is the method that i was taught .
it is what i believe in .
you want lipchiski , go somewhere else .
the police are here !
they're coming !
they were just here .
hide the safe .
where?
hide the fucking safe .
throw it off .
we can't move it .
the cops are here .
you think that's funny?
you son of a bitch .
you little son of a bitch .
fucking midget .
i'm gonna come out of this chair .
i'm gonna fuck you up .
i hate that fucking kid .
where was i?
circular ...
circular saw .
circular saw method .
in three hours , you got your hole .
what time is it?
two .
we'll now begin a full demonstration .
the police are here !
baby !
sgt. babitch is here .
he's coming around the back .
he'll bury us .
hide the fucking safe !
what?
where?
all right , guys .
take five .
that's good .
babitch !
what a surprise .
you caught us on laundry day .
you sing while you launder?
speak english .
we're a chorus for the church .
which church is that?
it's the ...

would you know anything about a job in youngstown?
a safe with a hole about the size of your head .
where's youngstown?

you're all from collinwood .
and you're all bums .

i'm the tenor .

well , you keep laughing , champ .
all the way to the pen .
if a job goes down in the next few weeks , i'll know whose asses to string .
jesus .

where have you been?
my kid's starving .
the bus never came .
i had to walk .

they're getting senile .
so he moved them in next door to keep an eye on them .
the girl's their maid .
the maid , huh?
well , don't worry .
i once seduced the first lady .

i like humble people .
for instance , if you were , say , i don't know , a maid and not an heiress ... ... i'd still think you were just as pretty .
hey , what's happening , young blood?
crazy kids .
that's a joke we play on each other .
so where do you live?

you know , she was jealous .
yeah .
she was telling the truth .
i'm really just a maid .
i thought because you were a big salesman and everything ... ... you wouldn't like me as much , so ...
please .
we live in a democracy .
i don't care you're a maid .
you can be anything you want .
i know .
i just ...
i don't know .
i was just being silly .
i'm a silly liar .
you're not silly .
you're not silly .
you know those old ladies i work for?
yeah .
they're going out of town on tuesday .
and i live over on the west side , and i was thinking you could ... ... come over for a nice , romantic dinner .
i'd like that .
i'd like that a lot .
what did you say?
that i'm off on tuesday night and i ...
no , no , no .
the old ladies .
they're going to see their mother in steubenville .
you could come to my place .

death scares him .
excuse me , gentlemen .
it's time .
we ain't done nothing to cosimo that he ain't done to somebody else .
still don't make it right , i guess .
he was a good friend to me .
what are you talking about?
he was an asshole .
he'd screw his mother and not think twice .
watch your mouth .
it's not about him anyway .
okay?
it's about the job .
we worked hard for this thing .
this is our dream we've been building here .
what's your son gonna eat?
your guilt?
who'll pay for that wedding reception?
the memory of cosimo?
you're the poorest man i ever seen .
did cosimo ever help you out?
and you .
are you gonna stay a bum all your life?
this is about the job , plain and simple .
we all need it to survive .
and there ain't a goddamn thing we can do to change that .
how you doing?
it's antwerp .

babitch smells blood .
good luck .
he's putting the screws on us .

the chick , the maid .
out the window !

there's no place to go once you get out except down !
oh , my god !
carmela .
pero?
what a surprise .
how did you find ...?
how did you know where to find me?
is this your place?
no , this is much too modest for me .
this is my brother's place .
my brother mico .
he's an artist .
he likes the squalor .
hi , mico .
i'm carmela .
hello , young woman .
i'd shake your hands , but i'm inspecting these bottles .
what's the matter?
i'm afraid of ...
i'm afraid of heights .
i wanted to tell you something .
i quit the old ladies tonight .
yeah .
you'll find another job .
you would've been so proud of me .
i never told you this before , but they were really terrible to me .
the things they would make me do .
they're incontinent , for god's sakes .
but then i met you , and you made me feel like i was worth something .
i thought , " i have pero .
i don't have to take this crap no more .
so i called them " spoiled babies , " and they fired me .
they were so upset by it ... ... they canceled their stupid trip to steubenville tonight .
what?
what?
yeah , but then they went anyway because they're stubborn old bats .
and i kept the keys .
we should go back and wreck the place .
my , my , my .
she didn't turn the keys in .
yeah , i heard her , mico .
you know what?
you're very upset .
maybe i should take you home .
i don't wanna interrupt your bowling .
won't you miss pero at bowling?
my arm's broken .
i'm not going to a fucking bowling match !
poor mico .
he's so upset because he can't bowl .
the window seems to be okay .
if you have any more problems , just give us a call .
hello .
okay .
am i dead?
there you go .
so where's the next window?
next stop , 25th street .
ohio city .
i like your brother mico .
he's a little strange though .
he had ... ... syphilis as a baby .
yeah .
you know what?
now that i think about it , i wish i didn't have those keys on me .
if anything were to happen while they were away ... ... those old crows , they would blame me .
how could they blame you?
you're a small girl .
that's nonsense .
could you do me a huge favor?
sure .
could you take the keys on your way home ... ... and drop them off with the janitor?
i would just sleep so much better .
but how could they blame you?
you're a small girl .
that's ...
oh , no .
pero , they're not here .
oh , my god .
i think i left them in the front door .
oh , my god !
someone will rip that place off .
we gotta go back .
driver !
wait .
wait .
wait .
hold on a second .
let me take a look .
no , they're not in there .
look , there they are .
thank you .
they would have killed me .
no wonder you couldn't find them .
look at all this lipstick .
one for every boyfriend?
no .
well , there's only one from now on .
don't worry .
you sleep good tonight .
and i'll take the keys back .
okay?
yeah .
all right .
you're always so good to me .
no , you are .
you're the best .
where the fuck have you been?

i couldn't get near them .
we gotta go in the old way .
but we're two hours behind .

stop moving around like a fucking monkey .
i'm scared .

oh , my god !
whatever about my ass being all over his lap .
you cause enough embarrassment to last a year .
when we went to your mother's ...
my shorts are coming down .
shut up .
and who came in?
your cousin , clarence .
you were making eyes at him !
that's so sick .
it's your own cousin !

i'm going back inside .
lf you cause a scene , i'm leaving .
we should stay out here all night !
screw you !
where are you going?
come back .

next time i say to keep your pants on , keep them on !
it's this one .

guys , come on .
come here .
hurry up .
we can drill a pilot hole right there .
this is it .

what a bizarre wall .
you hit the plumbing , asshole .
oh , shit .
oh , shit .
oh , shit .
ms. wiener , i'm in the apartment now , and everything looks fine .
wait .
there's some water on the floor or something .
goddamn !
oh , fuck !

no , the cat peed on the floor again .
no , i will not .
no , i'm the janitor .
i'm not your maid .

yeah , a very nice young man returned the keys ... ... for the girl about three hours ago .
yeah .
yeah , okay .
i'll leave them right here .
good .
yeah , i'll lock up .
yeah , okay .
bye , ms. wiener .
bitch .
goddamn fucking cat .
i can't believe this shit .
crazy fucking people .
okay , okay ...
you miserable son of a bitch .
i had to return them for an alibi .
lf i kept them , she could finger me .
you sold us out for a woman?
they would've had her arrested if the joint got robbed .
so we had to crawl in like " aminals "?
we wasted half the night .
look .
what's done is done .
and all the arguing in the world is not gonna change it .
now let's just shut up and get out the antwerp .
come on .
come on .
it's giving .
it's been giving for the last 40 minutes .
i need a breather , man .
so how much do you really think is in that safe?
well ... ... cosimo said that the old man swore to him that it was at least 300 grand .
goddamn .
that's a lot of money .
a person could live several lives with that kind of money .
i'm gonna buy a big loft with my share of the loot .
and one for my boy .
i'll pay them off so he never has to work a day in his life .
i'm gonna move to the country .
houses there are so far apart you can sit on your porch ... ... and read the newspaper in your underwear .
i'm gonna buy my wife a new gravestone .
you know , one that stands up .
with little angels carved .
in marble .
so , what are you gonna do?
i think i'm gonna build a gym .
i know everybody thinks i'm not much of a fighter ... ... but i think i'd be a good teacher , you know , for the kids .
man , i can't wait another minute .
come on , guys , let's go get the goddamn loot .
toto , get us some water .
it's like a jungle in here .
all right , come on .
something's happening .
it's giving .
shit .
here it comes .
here it comes .
yes !
yes .
yes .
good , sweet jesus .
how did you get in there?
i'm getting the water .
my god .
it's the kitchen .
the kitchen?
what are you saying?
it's the kitchen !
cosimo said the wall was in the living room .
this is the living room .
how can this be the living room if that's the fucking kitchen? !
what do you think , it's in the fucking closet?
shit .
you moron .
you unbelievable idiot moron .
how was i supposed to know they had two living rooms?
who has two living rooms?
you should've looked .
you should've looked while we were busting our asses .
i got the water !
unbelievable hack .
you poser .
you've killed us .
me?
yes , you .
you've killed us .
what are you talking about?
we move the crank in here and do it again .
it's 3 a . m .
we'd never get through the wall and crack the safe .
we could drill fast .
it's impossible !
we'd drill our way into the joint .
it's over .
we can still do it .
we can still do it .
i'm telling you .
leon , help me .
we'll never make it , man .
hey , toto .
come on .
god , i needed that money .
i needed it so bad .
you've ruined us .
what are you talking about?
i did everything .
from the start .
i got the bellini .
i planned the job .
i wooed the girl .
i paid off babitch .
i did everything .
i gave everything i had for this !
everything !
you know what we did?
we believed .
you gave us hope with your fucking bellini .
and then you ripped our hearts out , and you smashed them .
what is that?
what?
christ , i'm more broke now than when i started this fucking thing !
i wish i'd never met you .
any of you !
jesus , i think i'm gonna be sick .
i'm sorry .
i got a kid , for chrissake .
what am i gonna do?
sweet jesus .
hey , guys , take a look at this .
it's a cookie jar stash .
there must be 1000 bucks here .
not a bad consolation prize , huh?
let me see that .
it's delicious .
the girl must have made it before they fired her .
i'm gonna heat this up .
at least we'll eat good before we go .
the pilot light must be out .
got a match?
wait a minute .
does anybody smell ...?
i think it's probably a good idea if we don't see each other anymore .
wait a second .
i gotta give you your cut of the take .
it's for your wife .
get her home .
thanks .
what are you gonna do?
it just wasn't our night .
i better get home and apologize to my sister .
be well , old man .
if you get any more bellinis ... ... just give me a call .
so ... ... where are you going?
i don't know .
get cleaned up , and maybe i'll go see carmela .
that's a good idea .
she's a nice girl .
yeah .
i'll see ...
hey , this safe ... ... this job , it's nothing .
it's just money .
money comes , money goes .
i'm an old man , i know .
but to have someone ... ... somebody to walk with ... ... at your side ... ... is everything .
she's a nice girl .
yeah .
yeah , she is .
