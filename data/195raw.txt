we completed our search of the world of darkness .
that would be your bats , your leopard cats , your mole rats .
we came up empty , sir .
there's no place like home .
it's gotta be a building .
we checked them all .
we checked the monkey house , the reptile house , the giraffe house .
even the outhouse .
we scanned the entire grounds to a depth of 20 feet .
this guy was a heavy equipment operator .
five minutes with a machine , he could've buried the gold anywhere .
so where does that leave us , sir?
square fucking one .
come on , let's go check the outhouse again .
let's go .
we have a national security crisis .
citadel 4 is the same system we use to safeguard our nuclear facilities .
this guy took it apart like he was hot wiring a toyota .
i'll give you the short version .
we're talking world class loner .
a guy who spent literally tens of thousands of hours at a computer ... ... feeling around in the dark .
nothing but math .
nothing but numbers .
his sense of well being , his very sanity is predicated on completion .
only this time , the equation is incomplete .
he didn't get the 42 million in gold he'd worked so very hard for .
that's our edge .
now this ....
this is what i need your money for .
it's a bc 19 .
it's an experimental tracking device .
dr. harris here can fill you in .
well , it's quite simple , really .
the bc 19 has a proprietary signal ... ... broadcast and location .
it's got a 10 mile radius and full satellite coordinate tracking .
now , the optimum placement site ... ... is the temporal mandibular joint .
it's just below the jaw .
all right , look ... ... we implant this in the appropriate subject , put him ... ... on the street , make it known he knows where the gold is ... ... and i guarantee that our elusive computer whiz will show up .
who would be willing to have that thing implanted in their jaw?
senator ... ... we already have a volunteer .
this is howard cosell .
down goes frazier !
come on .
tenderize that bitch , alvin .
what you got?
i got all kinds of shit .

listen to me .
i had a grandfather who was a trapper by profession .
now he had two prices on his card : wolf ... ... and everything else .
now a wolf . .. ... will starve itself to death ... ... rather than make a mistake .

did i ever tell you that i had a very happy childhood?
that's not what stevie says .
stevie .
dad used to pick me up every day to take the cargo train to manhattan .
go to the horse track .
i knew it really well .
i know .
your dad trained horses .
not really .
no .
no , he was a ....
he was a groom .
i lied about that .
but he was a great groom .
with the thoroughbreds , he was magic .
i say he was the best .
but , you know , job didn't pay shit .
so , therefore , our christmases , we didn't get jack shit .
which really pissed him off .
one day he just went to this toy store and just stole all these toys .
robbed them .
brought the toys over to the crib .
i was like , " damn , santa claus got the wrong address or what?
so i'm bouncing from toy to toy like i'm some kind of drunk dude .
mom's smiling .
my father's smiling .
it's all good , right?
then around 8 : 30 , cops show up .
take the toys , take my father .
but for about two and a half hours ... ... l had a very , very happy childhood .
why are you telling me all this?
because i love you .
talk about a bunch of crap .
it's all in his file , sir .
it's all true .
he knows so much , why not get a job at the track?
he's had a record since he's 14 .
can't work there with a record .
oh , they all got sob stories .
he's just trying to get laid .
what you use on your skin?
it's so soft .
you feel that?
oh , yeah .
you feel so good .
what's that smell?
it's mango .
mango .
oh , mango !
and some pineapple .
oh , shit .
who is he?
all right , i'm gonna go to starbucks and get a mango grande .
mocha .
mocha cappuccino .
who is it?
registered letter for alvin sanders .
who's it from?
uncle sam .
damn .
i just got out , man .
why you bugging me?
i know my rights .
it says in the constitution on page 53 , " we the people ... ... in order to keep shit straight " quit messing with me .
i think it's a check .
good afternoon .
where l let me see where i sign .
i don't ever get no checks .
i was about to go postal on you .
no pun intended .
i know all about it .
y'all do it for real and everything .
you make the news
all right .
apologies from the federal government , $5000?

hey , man , tell uncle sam he cool with me , man .
apology accepted .
tell him he can come through anytime he want to .
five g's .
i'm up in there !
i'm up in there !
sir?
you think maybe we gave him too much?
let's just hope this keeps him out of trouble for a couple weeks .
butt naked in the forest , but does anybody hear me?
what are you doing here?
what?
i'm here to see you .
listen , i got great news .
you found a job !
no , no , not yet .
but i got something better than that .
you said things would be different this time .
things are very different .
look at this .
i got a check from the government for $5000 .
the government gave you $5000 .
all right , tell me anything .
the government gave me a check .
i signed it over to you .
what the fuck is he doing?
that's our money he's giving away .
actually , it's taxpayer money .
i could give you this money .
it'll pay for some of the things ... ... like the back rent .
some of the money i borrowed
like the stereo you sold .
i sold the stereo?
or the vcr you took .
i took the vcr?
the blender my mama gave me .
the blender was cheap .
i didn't get that much money for the blender .
i'm not taking it , alvin .
i don't think you understand .
i been trying to get a job .
it's hard right now .
that's a lot of money .
i think you need it more than i do .
take some money and get gregory something .
get him platinum baby pieces or something like that , you know .
he'll probably be a little rapper .
no , maybe he's gonna be a doctor .
why would he want to do that?
doctor's great .
i was thinking you thinking like i'm thinking .
just take the money .
get him some toys .
say it's from his father .
alvin , honestly , have you really been trying to find a job?
i have been out there .
you sound like my mom .
i want you to get this money .
go get you a nice dress .
we can kick it .
i can romance you .
look at your brown eyes .
now , come on .
get back to work before we both be out of work .
okay , step .
thank you .
sorry , my man .
don't mention it .
now what do we do?
simple .
we give him more money .
you sure that's necessary?
he 's trying to change .
he 'll never change .
we just gotta keep him clean for a few more days .
well , how much money?
sixty five hundred .
wouldn't it be cheaper to send him to nyu?
how do you feel about working in alaska?
i'll get right on this .
you gotta help me , man !
you gotta help me !
get your damn hands off me .
slow down coming through here , now .
what's going on?
hey , you dropped your bag !
hey , man , you dropped your bag .
yo !
you dropped your bag .

you done dropped your bag .
oh , shit .
oh , shit .
i'll take it to lost and found .

how's your headache , though?
what headache?
does it hurt?
i'm passing whuppings out .
okay , okay , i see what you doing .
you got the gun .
stevie's fucking my girl , right?
that's a point to take up with stevie .
maybe stevie don't want to be around for us to make a point with him .
what are you talking about?
stevie skipped out .
then say it .
don't get so fucking complex .
i'm not complex .
you're complex .
do i need to be here for this shit?
shut up !
should we move in?
stay put .
they're not gonna kill him .
they're just having fun .
they'll beat him to a pulp .
i think that's a reasonable assumption .
i hope you like soup ... ... because i'm about to knock every one of your teeth ...
... down your throat .
excuse me .
can you tell me how to get to the fashion museum?
i'm a little lost .
put the gun down .
what's your problem?
go get lost somewhere else .
ain't you shocked at how it went down?
you came at the right time .
we don't have much time , alvin .
what you talking about?
there's a question you need to answer .
that's him !
that's our man !

unit 2 , approach from the south .
you need to answer my question .
how you know my name?
i'll see you soon , alvin .
there he is !

we'll just have to make sure he can .
oh , my nuts .

my balls .
okay , tickets .
is that you , alveen?
alveen !
shut up .
get your ass in here !
my name is alvin , not " alveen .
how could you give out my e mail address?
that is personal .
i don't even know it , and if i did ... ... nobody wants to talk you .
you must've given it to somebody .
there's a message in your name .
and nobody just breaks into netscape .
okay?
nobody is that smart .
hello , alvin , it seems we have some unfinished business .
unfortunately , your phones are being tapped ... ... and you're being followed .
someone's been listening
tika , not now , not now .
you have a beautiful son .
it would be a shame if you didn't follow these instructions .
leave the apartment at exactly 4 p . m ... ... and go to the following address .
he's moving .
take a taxi to the fifth avenue and 53rd street subway station .
get on the first subway car you see .
here we go .
i prefer the suspect alive .
but if anything goes wrong , don't hesitate .
take him out , no matter what .
if the only way to get to him is through alvin ... ... so be it .
you shoot ... ... l'll answer the letters .
just give me 60 minutes , people , without any fuckups ... ... you can have a nice vacation .
one more block and he gets a cab .
be alert .
this guy may not wait for alvin to get to the rendezvous point .
got you .
he's headed your way .
he'll be there in three minutes .
no problem .
well , i'm not certain that's entirely accurate , agent wooly .
arms at your side .
let's take a little walk , shall we?
alvin's passed wooly , but there's no confirmation .
his radio's out , sir .
what do you mean , his radio's out?
i just talked to him .
there's no response .
well , what about sanders?
he's proceeding exactly as told .
what's next?
the subway?
train's just arriving .
alert wood and boyle , and keep trying wooly .
i'm headed out .
ikeep your eyes open , everybody .
he's at the phone booth .
we 're in position .
i'm at the red bench .
they're all red benches .
that's him .
this is it .
this is it .
let's go !
out of the way !

i said , stop your car right there !
out of my way !
watch his hands .
game's over .
i'm just sitting on the bench .
cordon off the area .
cordon off the area !
go !
what in the hell is going on?
what are you doing here?
i heard y'all were giving away $5000 .
i thought i'd come and get me some .
maybe i didn't make myself clear .
my brother gave me money and a note ... ... to e mail him some fucked up james bond shit and meet him here .
ain't no crime in that .
alvin set this up?
damn , you getting smarter .
you think this is a game?
you and your stupid brother , you asshole .

i need to go to the crib right now .
you won't be seeing home for a long time .
how many times i gotta say i don't know where stevie is?
fuck stevie , okay?
this is about you .
this is about you and your friend who buzzed me with that thing .
that's what i'm trying to tell you .
he's after me .
how'd you do that?

hello?
like the guys with the dummies .
you know , with the voices and the dummies and shit .
yeah , yeah .

we're traveling in a black mercedes ... ... with two bert and ernie iooking motherfuckers inside ... ... on madison ave .
look at you .

i could see your lips moving .
we about to move past 59th street .
i'm gonna need backup .

i hate this guy .
he's the fucking devil .
alvin sanders is the devil .
what are you doing?
open the window .
what are we , goldfish?
help us out of here !
it's a blackout situation .
we are negative on all signals .
scanning visual matrix .
negative .
we could try to isolate a pitch .
it's a million to one shot .
i would like to make a deal with the united states treasury department .
sir?
it's wooly's channel .
can we trace it?
i'd like to trade the life ofa treasury agent . .. ... for the 42 million in gold .
transferring signal .
since you don't have my gold , i'll settle for the next best thing .
if you want mr. wooly alive , turn over mr. sanders to me .
midtown winslett , 36th street .
lisa , what's wrong with you?
girl , what's wrong with you?
alvin !
alvin , get up , baby .
please get up .
baby , get up .
come on , alvin .
come on , come on , please get up .
alvin , please get up .
why are you doing this to us?
why?
why are you doing this to us?
give us a break .
did you have a nice sleep?
what'd you do with lisa?
i put her in the other room with gregory .
they're fine .
this is new york .
we don't play these type of games here .
you see , alvin , i just want what's mine .
i was used by the government , and now they're using you .
i have nothing to do with the government .
oh , yes , you do .
they used you to get to me ... ... and i might add , quite effectively .
here i am .
now for your sake ... ... let's hope you can help me find my gold .
gold?
give me a pen .
i would like to make a deal with the united states treasury department .
that son of a bitch .
i'd like to trade the life ofa treasury agent
he knew alvin was being surveilled .
this whole thing was just a diversion .
if you want mr. wooly
all right , the drill is simple .
we find alvin before he does .
the math on this is extremely problematic .
you have information .
i need it .
you don't provide that information , i have to kill you .
what are my options?
well ....
obviously ... ... there's torture .
no , come on .
you're more creative than that .
that's ... uh uh .
that's a point well taken , alvin .
and besides , torture ... ... it's unpleasant .
yeah .
it's loud .
you're right .
so unpredictable .
wait , no , hold on .
no , wait .
see ... ... did that really hurt?
and if so , how much?
nobody really knows .
i do not have the time ... ... l do not have the manpower , and i do not have the assets for error .
do you understand that?
do you get that?
i am tired of fucking around with you , alvin !
when you get your money , you need to get an anger management class .
you !
no , you're not very smart , are you?
the only reason you're alive is because i allow it !
shut up !
shut up !
you like little kids , right?
that's my boy in there .
i can't let nothing happen to him .
it don't matter what's going on between us .
i'll do anything .
he ain't got nothing to do with this .
it's between us .
let's make this shit work .
let's go get that gold , man .
i'm sorry for that primitive outburst .
i've decided the best course of action ... ... is to contrast the fear of certain death with an indulgent incentive .
force you to choose between the extremes .
i'm prepared to offer you the same deal i had with jaster .
we find the gold , you get to keep six bricks to do with as you please .
roughly one million dollars .
and , alvin ... ... it's a one time , non negotiable offer .
the offer is a million dollars ... ... or you kill me .
correct .
a million ain't what it used to be with taxes .
if that's all you got ... ... we'll work with that .
clear .
what is that?
it's coffee , sir .
i wonder why he didn't kill him .
alvin must've talked .
he doesn't know anything .
i didn't say he knew anything .
i just said he talked .
secure the building .
check the stairwell to the roof .
take more men .
all right , let's go .
she gonna be all right , right?
she will be , if you do what you're supposed to do .
you're gonna have to trust me .
i could trust you a lot better if you would let my girl and kid go .
no , no , no .
i couldn't do that .
lisa and your little boy are motivational tools .
air unit , what do you got?
we got nothing .
do a sweep on channel 34 .
affirmative .
night vision .
negative .
infrared .
negative .
we got nothing .
no signal .
jesus !
alvin sanders is a needle in a haystack .
can i help you?
all right , detective wooly , go ahead .
the horses for the fifth race are on the track .
and they're off .
let's see what we have here .
what are you doing?
i told you it's in the back stables , not here .
i understand .
do you think he hid the shit in a concession stand?
this is perfect .
glad you like it .
hey ... ... hey , little man .
daddy got to run out and take care of some business .
i'll be right back .
you take care of your mother , okay?
i'm waiting , alvin .
yeah , i'm coming .
all right , little player .
what the hell is that?
while i have no doubt about your sincerity , if there is no gold ... ... l'm sure you'd agree , there should be some penalty .
we don't need these anymore ... ... considering there's no way my little toy can be disarmed without me .
all right , alvin .
lead the way .
i told you the shit wasn't over here .
it's in the back , in the stalls .
what if we don't get back in time?
we gonna end up killing 5000 people .
perhaps we shouldn't be standing around chatting , then .
anything happen to my kid or girl , it's gonna be bad for you .
the horses are on the track .
it's a major race for 4 year olds .
how much gold is there?
roughly 42 million dollars .
you the lncredible hulk?
how you getting all this gold out of here?
here .
yeah .
this is it .
all right , here we are .
right here .
nine .
no , no , no , no .
no , it's not very logical .
logical or not ... ... it's buried in the back .
don't get it if you don't have to .
i gotta get to my family .
i ain't gotta do shit for you  all right , open it .
you can open it yourself .
i don't give a damn .
open it !
whoa , whoa , whoa .
it's all right .
it's all right , big fella .
calm down , now .
calm down .
hold on , now .
just calm down .
it's all right .
easy , easy , easy , it's all right .
