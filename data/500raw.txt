gas analyzer .
this fish is very oxygen sensitive .

they're not so reliable as nature .
i need an expert in chemistry , not in ... husbandry .
young warrant officer is a shellfish without a shell .
he either dies or grows a shell .
i'll teach you to crawl !
'the word 'crawl 'is very popular here .
'lt means ... next to everything .
'tell cucumber he's not a rapper but ajerk . '
here sailors are trained how to leave submarine through torpedo units ...
will he squeeze in?
you will , if you want to live .
will he go up same as torpedo?
i'm afraid , the charge is different .
scuba diver catches a buoy rope and uses moussings ...
what is moussings?
what?
moussings are special knots on the rope .
just knots?
it is not that simple .
a diver catches these moussings , and moves up like a pregnant cuttlefish on thin ice .
moving slowly .
slowly?
otherwise caisson disease .

a german trophy .
my grandpa confiscated it from a german officer .

gena can do it ...
legkostupov !
the meaning of your name is
'airy , fluent '.
why did you spell 'frock 'like 'frog ', greatcoat like 'greetcoat '...
are you kidding?
there are words in russian language , many words .
you put them together and make sentences with a subject , a predicate and the rest .
and all this is the great russian language !
understand?
yes , captain !
the russian language is great .
make predicate and subject trade places you get intonation ... or 'bitterly our mother cries '.
understand?
this is poetry !
it's epos , mother's beaver !
raining .
snowing .
dusking ...
you see?
yes , captain !
when i read what you've written , my most private areas start itching .
one may break his cock from reading this .

i wish they were as clear ...
gennady ...
slav glrl

i've bought potatoes .
you have forgotten your mug .

'people can't see there exist some lofty things .
'they try to wash our brains with their manifestos .
'but they don't know we are made of different stuff . '
i can manage myself .
sure , you're a grown up .
you're full of mischief , gena .
what a person !
i mean the way you behave .
where are you from?
sm .
space medicine institute .
space?
exactly .
but since they wrap up space programs ,
i was sent to your submarine .

there are no outsiders in our boat .
so , root yourself in , as our commander says .
but i have my research program to attend .
you know , your program is fine ...
are you a doctor?
in a way ...
so , it is your line ...
it's like this ...
we have been sent from norway , as a lend lease aid , you know , a batch of latex girls .
you know , inflated rubber girls ...
it is strong latex .
3 mm , the average size .
for what?
not for what , but for whom .
forthe captain and forthe mate .
but keep it underthe hat , since the batch is small
the crew somehow manages , but these guys ...
are you kidding?
not at all .
they've no you know what for 6 months on end .

white masts that loom at the mooring
and distant towns in a haze .

comrades submariners , our mission is to destroy a flagship of a maneuver enemy .
than to dodge the chase and remain unnoticed for 24 hours .
hopefully , our crew will show its combatant valour , accomplish the mission and prove it's not for nothing they call our submarines 'black holes '.
excuse me , why 'black hole '?
'black hole '?
that's simple .
but nojokes , please .
it's practically impossible to hear our submarine at low revolutions .
we move stealthily ,

in this case good bye .

i've never heard about no peter orlov .
i am very sorry .
why the ice?
otherwise it may boil .
sometimes it is too hot here .
do you change the water?
sure thing .
she is a full scale crew member .
i know drinking water is scarce at submarines .
so , she's a full scale crew member and lives in the sea water .
silence mode ...
hush .
knocking sound on the port side , captain .
what kind of sound?
can't say for sure .
look around in the cells .
cell 7 checked , no problems .

comrades officers ,

katya ...
emergency alarm .

everything is all right .
come .
youjust saw a bad dream ...
everything isjust fine ...
water .
why water?
it's a disaster , captain , we have sunk .
what disaster?
something exploded .
what exploded?
a mine .
i heard it's a mine .
heard from whom?
i don't know .
just heard them shouting .
are we going to die?
sure , but not now , in a hundred years , when we're old geezers .
now look here , fresher .
i go first , you follow me in two seconds .
one ...
two ...
hey , 'slavs '!
is anybody there?
turn it off , youjerk !
shut up and lighten yourself .
o o , it's you .
it's me .
chernenko .
give it to me .
he was giving us pills .
antistressant .
keeps your spirits higher ...
really?
not lower?
no , higher !
confirmed by clinic tests .
are you wailing after taking a too many of your pills?
i'm not wailing .
i'm singing .
singing what?
a song .
i always sing , when it is ... spooky .
you sing again i'll bust your singing piece in .
clear?
it is waterproof .
i specially bought it .
can you explain to me what happened?
why should i?
dive !
it's not a real crash , okay?
it's a make believe alarm .
make believe?
sure thing .
make believe sinking .
make believe?
yeah , it's maneuvers .
it's sham sinking after being chased by a sham enemy ship .
sham sinking?
all things sham in the navy , except eating .
'slav girl 'is missing .
it's yanychar , i'm not surprised .
but the exercise time is over .
gena knows no standards .
he accomplished his mission to remain unnoticed .
and again he has broken the rules .
what about the brass?
they think hard .
we had graduated from the same school .
back then he was a legend already .
this yanychar of yours is a miscreant .
if i had my way with him ...
nobody can have his way with gena .
can you dive without our help?
i did some diving in turkey and passed instructions here .
don'tjerk with your legs too much in the water .
next diver's head is right behind you .
where are we going now?
to the mess room .
maybe there is another scholar guy stuck there .
what's wrong with you?
calm down .
let us read something .
what haven't we read?
'she felt no fear ,
'she knew that nothing bad could happen to him .
'assol was still the same little girl
'who had her own way of praying . '
mama , read louder , i do not sleep anyway , and gena is a sound sleeper .
i will stay with him .
what do you mean?
you know what i mean .
fresher !
i thought that was the end .
i got cramps in my leg .
where is fresher?
we were hit by a strong wave !
have you been conceived by a flaccid prick , scholar?
nojerking with your legs .
fresher , are you okay?
i'm fine .
never mind .
we'll shall yet break dance with you .
'we're made of different stuff ', right?
some scholar .
the road between moscow and leningrad is lousy with them .
i know why you elbowed your way to the submarine .
i know your kind .
you wanted triple salary , right?
you , scorpion .
you shouldn't have said this .
you don't know a thing about me .
nor do i want to .
but your status ...
status of a soldier?
i do not think it's funny .
you're right , status of a defender of my country .
but whom should i defend here?
myself .
your self?
myself .
why the heck i should defend you?
because you have your straps , and i haven't .
so what?
it is your duty to defend citizens of your country .
whetheryou like them or not .
is it clear now?
clear .
aren't you a ukrainian guy by any chance?
i'm russian .
why?
we had a guy named chan also a russian .
but he turned out to be a ukrainian , an ex politician .
comrades submariners !
today we may at last say
that our cherished dream came true .
now we , citizens of the free ukraine , possess the sea , the sun and this sacred land .
we are no longer somebody else's granary feeding our hungry and lazy big brother , who is fond of drinking into the bargain .
after some time our country will become like slavic france or canada .
where is lvan?
nelly is in heavy labours .
today we are all to face heavy labours .
captain lvanov !
yes , sir !
you , pubic bone ...
ljoin the military and pledge solemnly to the ukrainian people to be a loyal and faithful officer , to protect ukraine , its sovereignty ...
to abide in good faith
ukraine's constitution and its laws , to keep the state and military secrets .
i pledge to perform my duties in the interests of my compatriots , neverto betray the ukrainian people .
captain konovalenko !
after lvanov you , konovalenko , have no choice .
olga won't forgive you .
captain konovalenko !
mikola , you promised to your wife and in laws .
they are not here now .
you have your house and garden here .
you prefer naked sands and polar night and rachitis foryour kids?
those willing to take a pledge to ukraine
two steps forward .
the others follow me !
yanychar , wait !
hold your people !
it is an order !
you darned condom .
orchestra !
orchestra !
'slav girl farewell '!
yes , sir !
the crew , march on !
i got frightened !
this is a pretty sham sinking !
i thought they were alive , but they were all dead !
shut up !
why didn't you tell me the truth?
where's the commander?
commander .
you didn't tell me the truth !
you need the truth?
all right .
the third cell is flooded , same as the second one .
if the first one is flooded too , we are the only survivors .
and ourturn will also come soon ...
'the world paid so little attention to him
'that he considered himself a dead man '.
what?
what are you going to do?
will you bring here some light .
give me a hand .
comrade captain ...
here .
wind gets stronger , 20 meters per second .
turbulence 5 points .
visibility reduced down to 5, 5 km .
continue the search in the defined area .
start sending signals in keeping with the instructions .
mukhambetov .
have you taken the pliers?
what do you mean : 'where '?
in our language it means 'yes '.
roman cleans the debris , put the hardware on torpedoes .
deryugin , how are you?
those rooting for 'spartak 'are never stuck .
'spartak 'is the champion !
we are all champions here .
let it be light !
mukhambetov , you are the best .
i wonder , lvan alekseevich , the boat is a mess , but the eggs are intact .
they lie quietly in their cells .
an egg is the nature's mystery .
the partition door is locked !
have you tried to open it?
i have .
they did not let me turn the rack gear .
have you knocked?
yes .
so?
they knocked me back .
rap shall win !
how many breathers do we have?
twelve .
twelve?
exactly .
you go first and i follow you .
or vice versa .
we may knock , but i think they will not let us in .
why not?
by the book , they've no right to let us in .
i wonder why?
because it is prohibited by sl !
attention , i'm commander of cell 3 .
if you hear me , answer .
if you hear me , answer .
we hearyou very well .
we hearyou very well .
i am sailor fresher .
it may be one way communication .
if you hear me give a knock .
how many of you are there?
two , it seems .
or he surfaced to get some air .
hpa .
high pressure air .
and sl?
what do you need it for?
you never know .
no letting in .
categorically .
of course it's a risk , but ...
we may all get drowned here .
ten is betterthan two .
nikolai , suppose it was you behind the partition?
i wouldn't knock in their place .
attention !
we're getting ready to let you in .
clear?
at first we give you hpa .
by this time the doorto cell 3 should be open .
clear?
watch the level to be reduced .
on reaching the third cell , batten yourselves down , give us a knock and stand by .
clear?
give hpa !
align pressure between the cells .
legkostupov , be careful !
i hope you all know how to blow the air?
fresher !
quickly to the partition door .
when the level reduces , batten yourself down .
in 1986 boat 320 ...
i remember .
an 0 . 5 difference smashed 3 people against the wall .
pressure in cells reached seven point five .
ready?
i count to three .
on three we open the door .
one , two , three !
'ln this respect assol
'was the same little girl
'good morning , god ! 'and 'good night , god ! '
'ln her mind this little was enough
'forthe god to keep away all her misfortunes .
'she knew that god was busy with other mlns of people
'and minor shadows of life
'she should take patiently ... '
a child was born and made his first step , and his first words were 'spartak '
'spartak 'is the best .
i root for 'locomotive '.
we'll make you warm and reform you .
the song makes things prosper .
all in your cell safe?
i battened down in time .
i was dead asleep and woke up right in the water .
seen anybody?
yes .
gena?
i came on behalf of the commander .
it's not even me , it is the baby who gets nervous .
and you left him behind?
no , he is here with me .
usually he is quiet , but today ...
i even read a book to him ...
did it help?
for a while .
you know ...
they'll give you a lift now and then you'll go to sleep , ... sleep like an angel .
like an angel?
yes .
because exercises proceed as planned , there is a contact with the submarine .
your husband has successfully completed shooting ...
shooting ...
i may send him your love during next contact .
there is no need to do this .
it's not me , it's the baby who gets nervous .
i see ...
now you've a sin on your soul .
you wanted me to tell herthe truth?
wait a second .
i know where to look forthem .
have you sent our coordinates to the hq?
the emergency buoy has been torn away by the storm .
we can't radio them from underwater .
we have to surface .
or at least to nearthe surface .
which we can't do .
we can only ... knock .
but we have to do something !
do i irritate you?
me?
no .
thanks .
because even taxi drivers stop talking to me after a while .
may i?
why not .
don't be too gluttonous .
yes .
tomorrow we'll be leaving through torpedo sections .
tomorrow?
tomorrow .
we'll be using moustings .
moussings , you shitty scholar !
treat yourself , captain .
comrade commander , may i?
i have known yanychar since military school .
speak to the point .
despite his mischief he would never leave the assigned area ...
evidently the submarine was moved away by underwater currents .
he should be somewhere here .
are you sure?
yes .
72 meters .
not far away from home .
comrade commander , there are 12 breathers , and we are 13 .
does it mean that someone stays behind?
i even know who stays behind .
me?
everybody rests .
wake up time at six a . m .
who is to be the thirteenth one?
haven't yet decided .
let it be me .
why?
it all happened because of me .
not because of me personally , because of this watch .
you said you wanted to become a submariner .
i've heard this story .
not exactly .
'no way !
'and no watch foryou ! '
and he died afterthat .
he was a very obnoxious person .
he did not like submariners?
he hated them .
his girlfriend had walked out on him with a submariner .
so when he was lying in the coffin , ljust ...
lifted the watch?
he did not need it anyway .
he was dead already !
what a man !
you're still full of surprises .
so it is all because of me .
why?
can't you see?
my granddad went to war in this area , he set mines .
so it was his mine !
his mine?
he has taken revenge on me !
because of the watch !
now is it clear?
yes .
go to sleep .
chernenko , what kind of a song do you sing when you feel afraid?
my mother's .
sing it now .
i can't go to sleep .
will you?
oh , no .
don't be too proud ...
see , you have a mother .
you said you were lonely .
my mother is dead .
i am sorry .
comrade commander !
tell us some story .
you have a way of telling funny stories .
a screamer , eh .
just the right time forfunny stories .
ok , you deserve it .
i'll tell you a fairy tale .
not about a cockerel , but about a cow .
this was not long ago , but long ago , it seems .
our army seemed to be almost done for .
and it still seems almost done for .
people were afraid to wear uniforms .
they'd steal and trade everything , from old underwear to secret torpedoes , at the same price , mind you .
officers became bandits , bankers , politicians .
but only two orthree persons had left gena ...
so to survive through the winter we went to a collective farm to dig some potatoes .
comrade commander , they've brought empty sacks .
i say , empty sacks ...
i and gena doubled in at an old lady's .
and her cow was even older , nobody milked it for a hundred years , so the old lady decided to have it slaughtered .
somehow our citizens are convinced that a russian mariner may slaughter anybody , even a cow .
i'll fry some liverforyou and make steaks .
only slaughter my beloved cow , pretty please .
granny manya , how can i ever do it?
i am a submariner .
i had no wish to slaughter her beloved cow .
i am fond of animals since childhood .
please , do it , my dear .
will you offer me a bottle?
two bottles !
today they paid my daughter with pepper vodka .
well ...
'bandmaster '.
what?
i found a concertina .
take it .
you are welcome .
we had a miner , his name was ... never mind his name ...
he'd slaughter his own brother ,
let alone a cow , for a bottle ,
very well .
so i went to look for him , but he was nowhere to be found .
so i went to gena ...
will she give us vodka?
two bottles !
we'll do this !
the cow has a heart ...
on the left side ...
on the left side .
if we put her on her hind legs , it will be on the left side ...
but also the cow has horns .
too bad .
yes .
how about cracking a bottle first?
comrade captain .
you were looking for me?
a problem with a cow?
comrade captain , may i?
go ahead .
there is another way of killing it .
a secret weapon .
explosion ...
no ...
guided action .
here it is ...
the newest development .
it all depends on where you place the charge .
if you place it underthe cow's tail , it will be cut into two equal parts .
if you fix it to her horns , the explosion will be as strong as a hammer blow from the local smith .
to the horns !
a bit to the right .
not to hurt her eyes .
everything will be all right , commander .
the submarine was not on a firm ground .
is it on a firm ground now?
now it is .
i nearly had a yellow streak .
me , too .
so afterthis story the cow started giving milk .
i bit my tongue .
we hit the bottom , but we are together , and spartak is the best !
spartak is the best !
golden fish , keep us all alive ...
i am not afraid , not at all .
maybe a little bit .
board 26 !
here is the principal direction of the search .
the sector 90 090 ...
we are going out by threes .
the first and the last will be the most experienced ones .
i will stay in .
when you all surface , captain orlov will go back here with a breather , and we go up together ...
captain , what about your diving suit?
no more questions .
yes , sir .
comrade captain , my breather is defective .
same with mine .
and with mine , too .
krauz , you were in charge of breathers , weren't you?
yes .
have you checked them?
have they been in order?
don't you have anything to tell us?
i had no time to sell this ,
i should have left them with my daughter .
wearthem yourself , hans .
i promised , when our daughter was born ... with rubies .
unpaid debts is a bad sign .
i shouldn't have taken them along .
tie him up !
with what?
gimme the scarf .
don't .
don't humiliate me , peter .
why , nikolai?
nikolai !
a knuckle sandwich will tell him about discipline .
lieutenant orlov !
you are the last sailor in my cell !
the last sailor?
do you know who is to be the last but one?
so , brothers , you have blown it !
you were receiving the breathers?
lieutenant orlov !
stop it !
restore power supply .
yes .
mukhambetov !
follow me with the instruments !
playing dolls with them?
hit them in the mugs !
better late , than never .
say it !
we were standing ...
go on !
'let's go and receive breathers . '
we took a truck and set off .
we would stop every now and then .
why?
what for?
when krauz saw someone passing by he would tell the driver to stop and he'd go out .
then he went out and ordered us to go and get the breathers .
get the breathers .
go !
yes , sir !
he tried to sell earrings .
you know , captain ...
krauz's wife two times him with a kiosk guy , because he has heaps of money , and a sailor has empty pockets , although he has ten autonomous missions to his credit .
krauz loves his wife , and they have a daughter ...
so he started borrowing money to buy earrings , to keep his promise .
and the bitch wouldn't accept them .
how do you know this?
after a hearty drink ...
you drink with someone , he opens his heart to you .
though , there is a risk of opening your own heart .
i see .
so , you received the breathers?
did you check them?
'the breathers are fresh from the plant . '
we have to check them .
check any one at random .
and the truck was honking .
have you checked them?
only one .
was it charged?
yes ...
nelly , i propose to you , from my very heart .
hey , romeo , 'twas not in the deal .
you'll break your neck .
don't worry .
pick up your stuff .
i've come foryou .
vanya and i are getting married .
i know that you love 'me '.
not him , but me .
vanya and i are getting married .
nonsense !
we'll rectify it right now .
hold it !
peter .
shit !
peter !
lieutenant orlov !
here !
come to me .
yes , sir !
we'll come back and get repaired .
take a seat .
yes , sir !
whom , in your opinion , shall we send?
a sailor is no advisor to a captain .
sorry i hurt yourfeelings .
i lost my nerve .
we need someone physically strong , a good swimmer and diver , an experienced person .
and a person of moral integrity .
i know such a person .
captain lvan muraviev .
i wanted to take your advice ...
it wants a lucky guy .
actually , everybody here is lucky , unlucky ones are left behind the partition door ...
how about casting a lot?
cards may be a better option .
let's play 'fool '.
a 'fool 'will go ...
with straps .
everyone here is with straps .
but one ...
'young to poupyr .
p. s.
'which in greek means 'see below '.
'yesterday i drank the sea water .
that's something !
'something you will never forget ... '
'i'll come back and tell you ... '
comrades ...
officers ...
brothers ...
i have so much to tell you ...
words fail me .
i have words , but they are not proper .
i thought real heroes never existed , they were just made up by people .
but you are real heroes , you are real russian sailors .
forgive me forthinking ill about you once in a while ...
forgive me , that it is me who is going , and not ...
forgive me if you can .
i will do my best
i will do my best to ...
you asked me to sing a song , but it is a ukrainian song .
so you're ukrainian !
i knewjust as well !
and you said it was of no importance .
my mother was ukrainian , my father no one knows who .
so , you asked me ...
this is a 3 mm latex foryou .
comrade captain , may he take my cap , for extra warmth .
god be with you .
bend your head .
comrade captain , may i write a note?
to be ashamed of it later?
no notes !
sit down .
we need to remove airfrom the diving suit .
otherwise you will hit the surface like a cork .
breathe quietly , slowly , okay?
with this you click onto moussings .
and exhale 14 times .
then you move up till the next moussing , okay?
don't be rush .
you crawl up and push the buoy in front of you .
as soon as you reach the front lid , knock with this clevis .
we let in sea water and align pressure .
we open the front lid .
as soon as you are out , fix the clevis to a hook on the left side of the hull .
an eye hole like hook ...
a hook like this ...
don't forget to fasten it , or else you and us ...
understand?
when you reach the surface , quickly move this thing to the atmospheric breathing .
and yell at the top of your lungs , to get rid of nitrogen in your blood .
otherwise it will be caisson disease foryou .
don't remove your hydro suit on the shore , it will be heavy , at least you will not freez ,
take care of the breather while crawling along the pipe .
then keep on running , like a sprinting hippo ...
traffic lights , the curb ...
you'll walk along the curb and you'll see a woman ...
awoman , and another woman .
oh yeah !
do it .
you may go free , great people .
oxygen left for 12 more hours .
hey , fresher .
fancy for an orange?
i know this trick .
no oranges .
you're wrong .
presto !
help yourself , sir .
ticking on .
i've neverthought how great life is .
nikolai , how are you?
i want to go to venice .
it's where othello strangled his desdemona .
great foryou .
we'll go sight seeing .
only he strangled her in cyprus .
what a shame .
'cause i want to go to venice ...
