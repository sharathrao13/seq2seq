daddy?
what's that noise?
it's only a waterfall .
no , the other noise .
guns , sasha .
are they fighting?
they must be .
it's a long way away .
let's go to sleep .
get him !
no !
look .
ls that all?
that's all .
bring him .
who sent you here?
no one sent me here , commander .
i'm with my wife and child .
they're on the train from moscow .
yes , we've checked that .
then?
you put your knife with a fork and a spoon and it looks innocuous .
perhaps you travel with a wife and child for the same reason .
yuryatin is occupied by white guards .
is that why you're going there?
no , we're going on to varykino .
not through yuryatin .
it's under shellfire .
commander , i'm not a white agent .
no , i don't think you are .
all right , kolya .
thank you .
sit down , doctor .
take it .
it's not as silly as it seems .
there have been one or two attempts .
are you the poet?
yes .
i used to admire your poetry .
thank you .
i shouldn't now .
i should find it absurdly personal , don't you agree?
feelings , insights , affections .
it's suddenly trivial now .
you don't agree .
you're wrong .
the personal life is dead in russia .
history has killed it .
i can see how you might hate me .
i hate everything you say , but not enough to kill you for it .
you have a brother .
yevgraf?
yevgraf , yes .
the policeman .
i didn't know that .
perhaps not .
a secret policeman .
did he send you here?
yevgraf?
no , yevgraf's a bolshevik .
i don't know anything about these things .
oh , you know a great deal .
when you came in , you recognized me .
how?
has someone shown you photographs?
no .
i am certain you recognized me .
i've seen you before .
when?
six years ago .
go on .
christmas eve , you ...
you were there?
or has someone told you this?
i attended to the man who was injured by your wife .
why do you call her my wife?
i met her again .
we served together on the ukrainian front .
i'm sure she'd vouch for me .
i haven't seen her since the war .
she's in yuryatin .
yuryatin?
the private life is dead ... ... for a man with any manhood .
we saw a sample of your manhood on the way , at mink .
they sold horses to the whites .
no .
it seems you burnt the wrong village .
they always say that , does it matter?
a village betrays us , one is burnt .
point made .
your point , their village .
kolya !
what will you do with your wife and child in varykino?
just live .
take him away .
he's innocent .
you're lucky .
we were diverted .
do you know where to?
varykino halt .
hello?
how lovely .
oh , how lovely !
hello?
alexander maximovich?
yes .
it's me , petya .
your honor .
now , now , now .
that's all done with , you know .
how do we get to the house , petya?
as you always did .
look , sasha .
what is it , petya?
forest fire?
forest fire , your honor?
that's yuryatin .
poor souls .
first the reds , then the whites .
now the reds again .
that strelnikov , his heart must be dead .
go on .
we'll soon be there , sasha .
another five miles .
is it that far?
one forgets .
how is the place?
well enough , your honor .
it's all locked up , you know?
varykino .
all locked up , you see .
a body , styling itself ... ... the " yuryatin committee of revolutionary justice " ... ... has expropriated my house in the name of the people .
very well .
i'm one of the people too !
don't , your honor !
they'd call it counterrevolution .
father , don't .
petya brought us here , making him a counterrevolutionary .
they shoot counterrevolutionaries .
it's not the reds in the town , but in the forest .
partisans .
here?
who knows?
they go where they want and do what they want .
all we need is a roof .
and a bit of garden .
is there nowhere?
they didn't lock the cottage .
oh , yes , we can manage here .
the stove works .
i'll find a few sticks of furniture .
and some seed potatoes?
i'm afraid the garden is dreadfully run back .
yes , thank you .
well done , my boy .
scratch a russian and you'll find a peasant .
i've always said so .
well , you're wrong .
he works like a peasant but he isn't a peasant .
i don't mind , tonya , really .
it's a good life .
certainly is .
i wouldn't be surprised if you looked back on this time as one of your best .
awfully glad about the expected new arrival , yuri .
anna was born here , you know .
no , i didn't know that .
oh , i'm terribly glad .
here's winged mercury .
looks a bit down in the mouth .
petya .
what news from yuryatin?
no lard , no sugar .
oil next week , perhaps .
flour , salt , coffee ... ... and nails .
bad news?
oh , lord , not another purge .
no .
strelnikov's gone .
well , that's not bad news .
no , he's in manchuria , they say .
that's the news .
they've shot the tsar .
and all his family .
oh , that's a savage deed !
what's it for?
it's to show there's no going back .
yuri , why don't you go to yuryatin?
yes , why don't you , my boy?
it'd do you good .
why?
what's in yuryatin?
it isn't petersburg .
very decent little library there .
lf it's still there .
i wish you would .
no , i don't think so .
anyway , the roads are blocked .
zhivago .
yes .
how are you?
what are you doing here?
we're at varykino .
varykino?
why varykino?
why not?
we had to go somewhere .
but here?
i came to find my husband .
the one reported killed .
strelnikov .
i met him .
met him?
yes .
how long have you been living here?
about a year .
alone?
with katya .
where is katya now?
at school .
is tonya with you?
all of us .
sasha?
of course .
what are we going to do?
i don't know .
yuri?
it's awfully early , isn't it?
half past 6 .
what're you doing?
nothing .
couldn't sleep .
ls anything the matter?
no .
shall i get some tea?
yes , do .
hello .
you are silly .
we called and called .
did you?
i didn't hear .
well , we did .
hello , lara .
hello .
how's olya petrovna?
she gets worse and worse .
she gave us c. i. and arithmetic all morning .
c. i.?
civic instruction .
look .
that's very good , katya .
thank you .
it's the tsar .
the tsar's an enemy of the people .
well , he didn't know he was an enemy of the people .
well , he should've known , shouldn't he?
yes , he should .
fancy not knowing c. i. doesn't your little boy go to school?
lunch .
good .
come on , you .
smell .
what?
this one's a prizefighter .
yuri .
wait a minute .
there .
i'm going into yuryatin , darling .
what , now?
yes , i want to get some morphine , disinfectant .
i shan't need morphine .
you never know .
i shan't need it today .
no , but it's pretty close .
i hadn't realized .
you'll be back before dark?
long before .
yes , yes , my darling , do what's best .
i am not coming back .
i understand .
but never , lara !
you understand?
do you believe me?
comrade doctor , i need a medical officer .
sorry , i have a wife and child in varykino .
and a mistress in yuryatin .
comrade medical officer , we are red partisans .
and we shoot deserters .
where are you taking me?
to the front .
and where is the front?
good question , doctor .
it's where there are enemies of the revolution .
wherever there is one gang of white guards or foreign interventionists .
where there's a resentful bourgeois , an unreliable schoolmaster ... ... one dubious poet hugging his private life .
that too is the front .
how long will you keep me?
for as long as we need you .
now !
charge !
well , that was easy .
come on , doctor , let's see what we've done .
st. michael's military school .
you old bastard !
it doesn't matter .
did you ever love a woman , razin?
i once had a wife and four children .
he has been a good comrade .
and a good medic .
we took him from his wife and from his child .
none of this matters .
what does matter , comrade commissar?
tell me , i've forgotten .
this is contemptible .
he stays .
i command this unit !
we command jointly .
the party bulletin expressly states ...
i could have you taken out and shot .
and could you have the party taken out and shot?
as the military struggle nears its close , the political one intensifies .
in victory , the military will have served its purpose .
all men will then be judged politically ... ... regardless of their military record .
meanwhile , there are still white units in this area .
the doctor stays .
that concludes the meeting .
comrade , where are you going?
are you running away , comrade?
soldiers .
red soldiers or white soldiers?
soldiers .
tonya?
tonya !
sasha !
tonya !
this is yuryatin?
yes , yuryatin .
what's happened at varykino?
moscow folks?
yes .
they've gone away .
gone away .
there's nobody at varykino .
lord , what happiness !
they say you're alive .
someone saw you near the town .
i take it you've gone to varykino , so i'm going there myself with katya .
just in case , i've left a little food .
boiled potatoes mostly .
put the lid back on the pan or the rats will get it .
i'm mad with joy !
tonya .
tonya !
yuri .
tonya !
yuri .
tonya .
yuri , darling .
it's all right , yuri .
they're safe .
they're in moscow .
ln moscow?
yes .
tonya?
all of them .
they're safe .
safe .
firing squads !
better .
what?
i've got a letter for you .
i've had it three months .
and it was three months getting here .
it's from moscow .
i think it's from tonya .
it's addressed to you , care of me .
she came into yuryatin to find you when you vanished .
someone sent her here .
you met?
she's very fine .
my dearest dear .
i'm sending this to larissa antipova's ... ... because if you are alive , which god grant ... ... i think that is where you will go .
we have a little daughter , yuri .
did you know?
her name's anna .
father sends greetings .
sasha has grown quite a lot .
he's quite big now .
whenever we speak of you , he weeps and won't be comforted .
we are being deported from russia .
we can't make out if you'd be allowed to join us .
an organization in paris , which i mustn't name , will know where we are .
nothing is certain , and there's little time .
i'm writing this in haste .
they're coming for us now .
god bless you .
i must honestly admit that antipova is a good person .
yuri , when they got away to moscow , she left something here .
yuri?
may i come in?
yuri andreyevich , you've changed , i think .
oh , yes , decidedly .
larissa ... ... remarkably the same .
i came from moscow .
i'm on the way to vladivostok .
i'm here to offer you my help .
we don't want it .
speak for yourself .
we don't want it .
yuri andreyevich , you spent two years with the partisan's 5th division .
you have no discharge , so you are a deserter .
your family in paris is involved in a dangerous migr organization .
now all these are technicalities .
but your style of life ... ... everything you say , your published writings , are flagrantly subversive .
your days are numbered ... ... unless i help you .
do you want my help?
no .
wait , yuri .
larissa , three glasses .
no .
yuri , you must see how serious this is .
please don't underestimate me .
practically or morally , i'm not the man you take me for .
how do you know all this about yuri?
how can you help?
i do and i can .
isn't that sufficient?
no .
our eastern seaboard is an undeveloped area .
the commissariat of foreign affairs wants to form an independent state .
it affords us a temporary channel of communication with the outside world .
i have good contacts in the far east .
i've been appointed the minister of justice .
the bolsheviks trust you?
they trust no one .
they found me useful .
here's how i can help you .
you come with me as far as the pacific coast .
from there you can go where you like .
to paris , or not .
i think you'd better go .
your rarefied selfishness is intolerable .
larissa's in danger too .
by association with me?
no .
not by association with you .
you're a small fry .
by association with strelnikov .
i never met strelnikov .
you're married to him , they know that .
i was married to pasha antipov .
i understand , i understand .
but they don't .
you're being watched .
do you know why?
a husband is a sticky commodity , my dear .
go away .
more of your high minded lunacy?
you have a child to think of !
look here .
that's sugar for the child .
i don't want it .
you would refuse my sugar?
who are you to refuse me anything? !
now you go .
i came ...
go !
go !
i came to you in good faith .
stay here then , and get your desserts !
your desserts , do you hear me?
do you think you're immaculate?
you're not immaculate !
i know you !
do you hear me? !
we're all made of the same clay , you know !
clay !
clay !
lara?
he's rubbish , lara .
yes .
rubbish .
i wish he'd never happened .
does it matter?
doesn't it?
not to me .
what shall we do?
can we get on a train?
no , they'd arrest us on the spot .
i don't want to stay here and wait .
no .
listen ... ... we could go to ...
varykino .
they'd find out sooner or later .
yes , but later .
lf our days are really numbered ...
yes .
we'd better live them ... ... before we are parted .
yes .
father caught a flea !
ho , ho , ho
i love the snow one , two , three
anna taught me to write at this desk .
this isn't me , yuri .
yes , it is .
no .
it's you .
lara .
yuri !
yuri , there's a wolf howling !
oh , yes , i've ...
i've seen them .
they're frightened .
they won't harm us .
yes , i know .
i'm sorry .
it's ...
oh , lord , this is an awful time to be alive !
no .
it is .
it is !
no , no .
wouldn't it have been lovely if we'd met before?
before we did?
yes .
we'd have got married , had a house and children .
if we'd had children , yuri , would you have liked a boy or a girl?
i think we may go mad if we think about all that .
i shall always think about it .
will you write today?
no , not today .
katya !
come to me , darling .
victor !
we thought it was ...
quite .
i wonder if you'd mind , comrades?
my government has a train , standing in yuryatin .
there's a carriage for me and my assistants .
you will travel in comfort and safety .
i'm not going with you .
i'm not going without you .
so there's an end to it .
then i'll have to speak to yuri andreyevich in private .
strelnikov is dead .
what?
spare me your expressions of regret .
he was a murderous neurotic , and no loss to anyone .
do you see how this affects larissa?
you don't?
you're a fool .
she's strelnikov's wife .
why do you think they haven't arrested her?
why do you think they had her watched?
they were waiting for strelnikov .
if they thought he'd come running to his wife , they didn't know him .
they knew him well enough .
they caught him five miles from here .
he was arrested on the road .
he didn't conceal himself .
throughout the interview ... ... he insisted they call him pavel antipov ... ... and refused to answer to " strelnikov .
on his way to execution , he took a pistol and blew his own brains out .
oh , my god !
don't tell lara this .
i think i know her at least as well as you .
but don't you see her position?
she's served her purpose .
these men who came to escort me today will come tomorrow as a firing squad .
now i know exactly what you think of me , and why .
but if you're not coming with me , she's not coming .
so are you coming with me?
do you accept the protection of this ignoble caliban on any terms?
is your delicacy so exorbitant ... ... that you'd sacrifice a woman and a child to it?
there's some bags to carry , comrades .
get in .
come .
how many?
all of us .
sorry , not enough room .
there's got to be room .
it's all right .
i'll bring our sledge .
hurry .
this train has important people .
you start .
i'll catch you up .
right , comrades !
we'll see you at ...
hurry !
i'm afraid that's it .
your young man's not coming .
you fool .
did you really think he would come with you?
the man's an idiot .
from mongolia he could've gone to ...
he'll never leave russia .
you've come with me , haven't you?
yes .
to be sure , it was your duty as a mother .
that's right , victor .
i'm carrying yuri's child .
i was born out there .
in the far east somewhere .
maybe mongolia .
i don't remember .
you were born in mongolia , that very year .
so were a lot of others .
not many named tonya , bearing the name komarov .
komarov's a common name .
with fair hair , blue eyes , lost at 8 when war broke out in the far east?
there's something you haven't told me .
how did you come to be lost?
i can't remember !
you must remember something !
no !
i'll tell you how i first met your mother .
lf she was my mother .
you judge .
i picked my brother up , literally , on a moscow street .
he had a fourth class ration book and was undernourished .
he didn't seem to mind that or anything .
i thought he was a happier man than me .
he suffered me to buy him a new suit ... ... and to get him a job at his old hospital .
i saw him off for his first day's work .
this was eight years after he and lara parted .
so he never saw her again?
thank you .
you've been very kind to me .
he must've known how ill he was .
the walls of his heart were like paper .
but he kept it to himself .
he kept a lot to himself .
please .
i was astonished at the extent of his reputation .
his work was unobtainable at the time .
it was disapproved of by the party .
but if people love poetry , they love poets .
and nobody loves poetry like a russian .
excuse me , comrade .
are you yevgraf?
my name is lara .
i knew her name from the lara poems i'd found with yuri's manuscripts .
i knew your brother .
i need your help .
she'd come to moscow to look for her child .
i helped her as far as i could .
but i knew it was hopeless .
i think i was a little in love with her .
one day she went away and didn't come back .
she died or vanished somewhere ... ... in one of the labor camps .
a nameless number on a list that was afterwards mislaid .
that was quite common in those days .
tonya .
how did you come to be lost?
we were running in a street .
we?
my father .
not your father .
komarovsky .
i don't know !
the street was on fire .
there were explosions and houses were falling down .
he let go of my hand !
he let go of my hand .
and i was lost .
your father would've done that?
oh , yes .
people will do anything .
it was komarovsky .
this man was your father .
why won't you believe it?
don't you want to believe it?
not if it isn't true .
that's inherited .
comrade general , when i was a child , i wanted parents .
you can imagine how i wanted parents .
i wanted to die when i was a child .
you know?
now i don't know .
i can't be of any use to them now , can i?
i was hoping i might be of some use to you .
will you think about it?
yes .
it's all right , david .
you work here?
yes , i'm an operator .
and what do you operate?
that .
you've promised to think about it .
tonya !
can you play the balalaika?
can she play?
she's an artist !
an artist?
who taught you?
no one taught her .
then it's a gift .
