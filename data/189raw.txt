it's a restricted community .
your honor , my client did not fly home 5, 000 miles to jump bail .
you mean jump bail again .
no doubt .
he was in the wind for two years , judge .
if he decides to take off again , the mood of the people in this city ...
talk about the people !
we can't risk the possibility ... of waiting another two years , two months , two days , two hours .
the district attorney s office is ardently opposed to bail .
how about no bail?
remove that man .
get him out of here .
hey , back up , son !
back up , son !
hey , son .
hey , yo , you gonna get your ass twisted .
you better get off me !
your point is well taken , mr. torres .
defendant is ordered to surrender his passport to this court .
however , i believe that young mr. wade ... is sincere in his desire to deal with whatever form of judgment ... this room deems necessary to deliver .
bail is set at one million dollars .
what?
no !
my client is prepared to post bail .
oh , no !
what the fuck is wrong with you?
i'm out .
i'm done .
what are you , nuts?

hey , hey !
all right , i'm cool .
i quit .
i remember when i took that job thinking i could fight from inside , and you telling me about all the problems .
that color thing ...
too black for the uniform , too blue for the brothers .
about how justice gets tangled up in red tape or bought off by the green .
you were right .
fuck that job .
fuck the badge .
i'll get that silver spoon motherfucker my own way .
no lawyers , politics , no rules .
no pension .
what?
you're too hot , step off a bit .
let me put my people on him .
no .
hell no .
his ass is mine .
hey , what's the difference?
got is got .
his ass ... is mine .
we're in pretty good shape .
what about the waitress?
paul , talk to him .
thank you .
the truth is , walter , we can't find her .
this guy is great .
do you know why we can't finder?
'cause she doesn't want to be found .
do you want to go back to switzerland while we track her down?
it could take a year , two , ten , maybe never .
meanwhile , everything and everyone else is in place .
i don't believe this .
even if she does surface , she is seriously damaged goods .
it s just a roll of the dice , kid .
i'll roll my own damn dice .
now , walter ...
walter ...
