put her back into the wind , woods .
forty five degrees down swell .
captain , the barge is taking on water .

2 2 9 degrees magnetic .
captain?
captain .
once we're in the eye , we'll have calm seas for two hours .
we can make repairs , steady the barge .
skipper , should i head for the eye?
what the hell is goin 'on up here?
captain , the engine room is taking on water .
then pump it out , mister .
you're the bloody engineer .
we can't get in .
the bulkhead took a hit , and the door's wedged tight .
hiko's cuttin 'it now .
jesus christ , the barge !
we gotta cut that damn thing loose !
that's not an option , mr. baker .
skipper , should i head for the breach?
i need an answer now .
i'm losin 'her .

captain , take a look !
that barge goes down , we go down with it !
well , that's a chance i'll take .
i'm cuttin 'it loose .
stay away from that door , mister .
i mean , what's so precious about your goddamn cargo , captain?
the cargo is mine .
i've leveraged everything i own against it .
and it's not insured .
christ , what's the matter with those people?
so i go out that door , you shoot me?
i stay here , we're all dead !
get the tank !
hold the tank !
let me tell you something .
you ever put a gun in my face again
and you'll what?
you figure it out .
sir , what about foster's idea?
i can reach the eye .
i've let you down , lad .
the water's coming in faster than it's going out .
i can't believe we were stupid enough to sign on with that guy again .
maricon , ese got a gun on you , man .
i would've decked that son of a bitch .
he had us pullin '500 tons of lumber and steel , uninsured , in a typhoon , a hundred miles from any normal shipping lane .
and woods tells me foster got tossed out of the navy for striking a superior officer .
hey , hiko .
comin 'through .
i'll tell you one thing , stevie .
it's the last time we make a move ...
for percentage of cargo instead of a salary .
damn straight .
damn straight .
i told you it was a bad idea .
my idea?
it was your idea .
it was your idea .
what are you talking about?
how is it?
it's bad .
define bad .
we're sinking .
that's bad .
so does anyone have any suggestions?
mayday , mayday , mayday .
hello , mayday .
come back , please .
we got about four days of supplies .
what is this?
that's food and that's water .
put that back , okay?
we're gonna distribute
fifty mile range .
piece of junk .
hey , you buy this shit?
wait , wait , wait !
i'm picking up a contact .
there might be another ship in the eye with us .
twelve miles out .
speed : zero knots .
it's dead in the water , but it's really big .
let's hail it , foster .
ahoy , vessel , latitude 29 degrees south , longitude 1 7 9 degrees east .
this is the sea star .
we are 12 miles northwest of your position .
come back .
so where the hell is the captain?
i'm busy .
skipper , there's a ship in the eye with us .
dead in the water , about 12 miles out .
dead in the water?
i'll be there in a minute .
dead in the water .
captain?
dead ahead , 300 yards .
hail it , woods .
unidentified vessel , this is the sea star ... approaching from the northwest , 300 yards out .
dead ahead , 300 yards .
unidentified vessel , this is the sea star ... approaching from the northwest , 300 yards out .
please come back .
over .
you see anything?
nope .
not a thing .
that ain't ours , brother .
unidentified vessel , this is the sea star ... approaching from the northwest , 200 yards out .
come back .
over .
this is the sea star approaching from the northwest .
ls anybody there?
over .
she looks russian .
the academic vladislav volkov , missile and satellite tracking ship .
45, 000 tons full gross , 642 feet , two steam turbines .
300 .
armament : none .
she's fitted for scientific purposes .
their biggest .
forty two labs , five machine shops outfitted with advanced robotics .
three parabolic dishes can maintain simultaneous communication ... with several spacecraft .
ahoy , the vladislav volkov !
i'm the captain of the sea star .
ls there anyone aboard?
ahoy !
baker .
break out the shotguns , the flashlights and the walkies .
we're goin 'aboard .
shit .
jesus christ .
this is kind of stupid , stevie .
shh .
come on .
very stupid .
stevie .
this is very stupid , what we're doing .
stevie .
stevie !
those are bullet holes , stevie .
shit , i don't like this at all , man .
this is bullshit .
ahoy , the bridge !
anyone aboard?
the bridge is deserted .
what the hell happened in here?
what a mess .
looks like somebody powered it down , captain .
captain?
captain , do you see anything?
you'll be the first to know , woods .
what do you think?
pirates?
russian mafia , probably .
pipe down .
check the radio .
it's smashed .
these logs are worthless , unless somebody reads russian .
that storm wall is 16 miles due east .
captain , you've got an hour and a half .
he's , uh , thinking , foster .
you know , something you were paid to do?
you thinking what i'm thinking?
huh?
what?
salvage?
salvage , baby .
you all signed on for a percentage .
but you never figured i'd bring you this , did you?
a ship abandoned in international waters .
maritime law says she's a derelict .
all we have to do is tow her to safety , slap a salvage lien on her , and the russian government has to pay us 10o/ o of her value to get her back .
richie , put a number on her for me .
well , let's see .
there's three parabolic satellite dishes .
one of them's kind of fucked up .
forty two labs all primed with , uh , state of the art stuff .
let's see .
we're talking ... two hundred?
three hundred million? $300 million . $300 million !
ten percent of that is $30 million .
that's what's comin 'our way .
the opportunity of a lifetime if we play our cards right .
that's what , about 30 grand apiece?
three hundred g's apiece .
three hundred g's !
that's at one percent?
i'm willing to change all that , cut you in for ten percent .
that's $3 million each .
what do you think of that?
what do you think?
ls it legal?
totally .
totally legal .
shit .
i'm in if you're in , jefe .
hey , i'm good .
what about you , foster?
oh , foster , please !
come on !
what?
come on !
it's easy money !
there's no such thing as easy money , squeaky .
i'll take that as a yes , foster .
baker , find the ship's generator .
we need power to the bridge .
see if you can get the main engines running .
squeaky , you go with him .
richie?
throw a line down to the tug .
we're gonna have to turn this ship into the wind .
foster , can you see if you can get some of this navigational equipment started?
captain .
my father was an admiral .
i know a little something about maritime law .
lf there's anybody alive on this ship , you can't claim her .
then let's not find anyone alive .
what does that mean?
just that .
i hope we don't find anyone alive .
woods , come back to me .
we're gonna need to turn the ship into the wind .
it just doesn't add up .
you know?
russian vessel , middle of nowhere , dead in the water , crew vanished?
i mean , why would they abandon ship?
i don't know .
and another thing .
who the hell do you think we can trust here?
we're talkin 'about an awful lot of goddamn money , right?
listen , the only two guys that we can trust is just you and me , stevie .
that's it .
i wouldn't take a check from the captain .
woods is wound up so tight , you couldn't pull a pin out of his ass with a tractor .
and hiko is like
i don't understand what the hell hiko is .
richie's crazy like a fox , stevie .
but , you know , i think he just might be there for us .
and foster's good .
good "?
what do you mean by " good "?
i mean she's solid , on the level .
what'd you think i meant?
sounds like you think she's hot .
course i think she's hot .
don't you?
right here , steve .
right here .
got it?
yep .
yeah , that's it .
aw , shit .
no go?
nope .
what's wrong with this thing?
here's your problem right here .
looks like somebody trashed the control panel .
oh , yeah .
these three relays are unplugged .
let's hustle , squeak .
we got no power to the rudder in a typhoon ,
we're screwed .
i'm hustling , all right?
okay .
go?
give it a shot .
that's more like it .
captain?
i'm on my way , woods .
what the hell is that?
good job , baker .
you lit us up like a pinball machine !
tell you something .
we're gonna be rich .
you're gonna be a rich man , hiko !
captain?
somebody's running this .
looks like it's running itself .
computers don't run themselves .
i don't know much about computers , but that's an anchor .
emergency on top deck !
emergency on top deck !
anchor went down on the tug !
baker , did you copy that?
we need you up here oh , jesus .
baker , we need you on deck now !
already on my way .

we lost the tug , squeak .
she's gone .
that sucks .
how we doin 'down there , huh?
i'm doin 'fine .
this whole thing is automated .
it runs by itself .
negative , negative .
we got somebody else on board .
repeat .
we got somebody else on board .
that's who sank the tug .
now , i want you to bolt the engine room door shut .
you understand me?
i copy that .
and hurry up , will you?
listen , i think we should split up into two groups .
root 'em out .
i agree .
i just have to fix his leg .
hold your horses , mister .
i'm still captain here .
you left this on the bridge .
you were captain of the sea star .

three hundred crew members are gone?
what happened?
eight days ago , during a transmission from the mlr space station , something came onto the ship .
we thought our transmitters and receivers were malfunctioning , so we shut them down .
it took control of computers , scanned all information .
language , encyclopedias , medical data .
it was learning .
learning what?
how to kill us .
my captain , alexi , and me were the last to survive .
we cut their cables , smashed them
wait a minute .

squeaky?

holy shit .
what the hell?
oh , my god .
jesus christ !
squeak?
squeak?
open up !
don't shoot !
it's us !
where the hell have you two been?
back from your holiday?
jesus christ .
woods , you're a mess .
thank you .
you said a russian did this?
no , a machine did that with a nail gun .
yeah , that's right .
you're not gonna believe it till you see it .
there's some really weird shit goin 'down on this ship , man .
weird ain't the word .
i'm in need of some proper medical attention .
shut the fuck up !
i don't belong on this ship .
somebody just welded the engine room door shut .
it's welded?
squeaky's still missing .
weird .
r richie?
richie , it's that smell again .
squeak?
hey , squeaky !
squeak , man .
ls that you?
shit !
go !
that bastard shot at us !
you're all going to die .
you hear that , foster?
we're all going to die , because there are aliens on this ship .
that's all the grounds i need .
one of my men is missing .
and i want some answers !
and no more of this twilight zone stuff .
i don't know anything about your man .
rubbish .
i'm gonna give you five seconds , and then i'm gonna blow your brains out .
one  she couldn't possibly know where squeaky is .
she was hiding in sick bay .
she knows .
she dropped an anchor on my tug .
she fired at us .
two .
captain !
hiko , come on !
that anchor nearly killed me .
i'm not feeling too sympathetic .
me neither .
three .
shoot me .
i don't care .
just shut down the power to the ship .
captain , she's not gonna tell you what you wanna hear .
hey , captain .
i'd like to hear what she has to say about this .
up here on the chart table , richie .
fake bastard !
what the bloody hell is that?
it beats the hell out of us .
it's alexi , my captain .
hell , whatever it is , it tried to kill us .
squeaky's still awol , and somebody welded the engine room door shut .
we're not alone here .
she's got another friend down there .
can someone explain what the hell is goin 'on?
finish your story , nadia .
the energy that came from the mlr ... infested all of the ship's electrical systems .
mainframe computer , the labs , the machine shops .
it activated fire extinguishers .
sixty seven died from halon gas poisoning .
quarter of the crew .
it cut us off from machine shops and started building .
the little ones first the gatherers .
yeah .
we saw a whole room full of them .
that's what nailed woods .
then came something ... more dangerous .
half man , half machine .
a biomechanism .
engineering beyond our comprehensions .
the rest of the crew deserted , taking their chances in the sea .
only alexi and me stayed , cutting cables .
what does cutting cables have to do with it?
the machines are controlled by the electrical energy in the computer .
lf we can cut their source of power , they'll die .
we cut these to get him here .
what the hell are you talking about?
what is this thing that's inside the computer , huh?
it's a life form unlike anything we know .
not cellular but electrical in nature .
extremely intelligent .
you mean it's like lightning that can think .
it has no form , no shape , but it's giving itself what it lacks .
it's creating a new life form ... using parts of the ship and crew .
blood is still pumping through this brain .
there's been no decomposition at all .
yeah .
here , right here .
see?
there's ... some kind of coil or self contained power supply built right into it .
amazing .
this brain is still alive .
hello?
stop fucking around with the damn thing , richie !
i'm just looking at it , steve .
alexi?
touch it again , i'll cut your hands off .
i can respect that .
it's still alexi .
it's alexi .
rubbish !
you're listening to a pile of russian rubbish .
and i for one won't listen to any more of it .
there's no alien .
something their government cooked up .
it all went wrong , didn't it?
you're afraid the rest of the world's gonna find out about it .
dr. lgor fuckin 'frankenstein there .
alexi was no medical experiment .
he was my husband .
rubbish .
could someone please come and take a look at the nails in my shoulder?
woods , stop whining !
ow !
god !
ow !
oh , my god .
captain !
brace yourselves !
we gotta turn her into the wind !
the steering doesn't answer .
we could steer the ship from the engine room .
i thought you said the door was welded .
we'll cut the damn door .
right .
bring her .
i wanna keep her in my sight .
i gotta get off this ship .
all clear?
clear .
did you feel that?
the ship's turning .
we just turned 20 degrees into the wind .
the ship's steering itself .
ships don't steer themselves .
she's altered her course .
let's go .
come on .
engine room's one deck down .
what the hell was that?
could be squeak .
i don't care who it is !
i said it could be squeak !
steve .
jesus christ .
careful , richie .
yeah .
it's too weird , man .
you can't open that door .
what is it , steve?
i don't know .
what you got , richie?
i don't know .
it could be squeaky .
let me see .
let me see !
what the hell is that?
open the door !
steve !
don't open the damn door !
squeak?

steve .

where are we?
communications room .
good !
i'm callin 'for help .
did you trash this?
we destroyed every transmitter on the ship .
you didn't smash this one .
mayday , mayday , mayday !
don't !
what the hell is wrong with you?
are you out of your fuckin 'mind?
no one else is gonna claim salvage on this vessel but us .
you're no longer in charge .
come here !
what do they want from us?
it wants to kill us .
no , they want something .
it wants to mutilate us just like it did woods .
did you see squeaky?
that thing wants something from us .
why don't we talk to it?
it's in the computer .
we could talk to it .
what?
talk to it !
it's in the computer .
what the hell?
what do i do?
what do i do?
nadia , please help me .
i need english , please .
" who are you?
i am aware .
