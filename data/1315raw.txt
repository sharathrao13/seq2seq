the tarantino of titties .
yeah , there's just no way you could ever be this good .
hey , look , i'm going to prove to steve ... that i'm up to the standards of the stiffmeister productions .
after steve sees my directing talent ...
little bro's joining the family business .

he finally called you back?
no , but i left him another message .
he'll get back to me .
it's only been three weeks .
gentle fucks , a toast .
tomorrow , we begin our reign as seniors .
okay , people , let's take a break .
remember , we play this at the end of the ceremony after pomp and circumstance .
i don't want anyone starting the wrong song again .
elyse , you need to relax , girl .
i'm fine .
i just ...
you know , it's my first time up here , and ...

adios , butt hugger .
he's a bigger asshole than his brother .
holy shit , arrianna .
matt , what're you doing here?
oh , we just want to make sure the seniors have a very memorable last day .
that's cool .
so , there's a campout tonight ... and it's only for the grads , but you could come .

i just came by to wish you good luck .

good luck?
you haven't said a word to me since the eighth grade .

uh oh !
stifler !
i've been waiting for this moment for a very long time .
and now , the day of reckoning has come .
hello , matthew .
your brother must be very proud .
you've continued his legacy .
tormenting the innocent ... defiling all that is good and pure .
but now , you're going down .
what're you going to do , expel me , shermanator?
i am a sophisticated counseling machine ... sent back in time to guide young and innocent minds .
my primary directive is to protect the students of this institution ... and all , indeed all mankind ... from the menace that is another stifler .
behavior modification is required .
it's not too late to change your future .
no , expulsion would be too easy .
i know the perfect punishment to fit your crime .
since you have so much trouble with the band ... perhaps you should make friends with them .
no fucking way .
either you learn to be more considerate or you will be expelled .
no football .
no parties .
no spring break .
no graduation .
no college .
no coeds .
comprende?
pack your bags , stifler .
you're going to band camp .
band camp !
bullshit , trash .
all right , steve !
valley girls gone wild .
fuck .
told you steve'd get back to me .
i mean , it was just a postcard ... but it gave me a great idea .
look ...
steve's shit head friend , jim ... he married this freaking nympho band geek , michelle .
and he said all they do at band camp is screw 24/ 7 .
matt , buddy , you cannot screw band chicks .
there are standards .
i'm not talking about screwing them , scrotum breath .
i'm talking about videotaping them .
people love to see dorks doing that freaky shit on hidden video .
bandeez gone wild .
steve's gonna have some competition now ... because little bro's joining the family business .
yeah , spy chest .
secret video .
hell , yeah .
color night vision?
i'll take it .
shit .
how about tomorrow?
this is going be great .
welcome to tall oaks 2005 .
let's hear it from lloyd memorial high .

mount st. marie .
mount st. marie !
mount st. marie !
east great falls high .
east great falls !
east great falls !
and five time defending tall oaks cup champion ...
beechwood academy .
we're number one !
we're number one !
we're number one !
okay , settle down .
now , as you know , each year ... one senior tall oaks composer is awarded ... a full scholarship to the prestigious robards conservatory .
elyse , this is your year to win .
this year , dr. susan choi , president of robards ... will judge the compositions herself .
and let's not forget to welcome the tall oaks camp counselors .
if you visit our infirmary , nurse sanders will take care of your every need .
okay , so let's work hard , and may the best band win .
you guys ready?
what the fuck?
are you a rookie?
you look lost .
are you an asshole?
you're hairy , and you smell like shit .
i'll ignore that kind of talk once .
we don't speak that way here .
rookies are to wear their beanies at all times .
those are the rules .
and who made you the mayor of geek town?
i'm brandon vandecamp , senior drum major , beechwood academy ... and the president of the tall oaks council .
oh , and who are they , mr. president?
the first lady and vice pussy?
suits you well .
golly , jeepers , thanks .
hey , you know , since i'm an official band geek and all ... can you guess what my favorite piece of music is?
i have no idea .
the nutcracker .
step back , bitch .
holy mother of mozart .
this is bad .
you didn't know jackie chan was in the house , did you boys , huh?
stop that .
stop that now .
those knob slobbers started it .
that's not true , sir .
we simply reminded him to wear his beanie .
and then he viciously assaulted brandon's genitals .
that's a lie , you dick snot .
oscar , jimmy , escort this man to see ...
the macro .
the what?
you're dead .
now , gentlemen .
god , brandon , are you okay?
you want to tell me what the hell you're doing here , stifler?
it don't matter , big o.
he ain't gonna be here long .
bitch !
get over here .
macro gonna fuck your ass up , fool .
what the fuck's a macro?
the macro .
morale and conflict resolution officer .
i heard this one time , this kid went into that office ... a baritone and came out a soprano .
clarinet up the ass backwards , yo .
what?
pussies .
oh , i'm sorry .
frankenstein .
scary stuff .
i am just a boris karloff nut .
i'm the macro , mr. levenstein .
holy shit , you're jim's dad .
he screwed that redheaded nympho chick at my lake house .
oh , my , you're not a stifler?
yeah , i'm steve's brother , matt .
there are two stiflers?
yes , sir .
hey , what're you doing here?
oh , well , jim is now out of the house , married to michelle ... that redheaded nympho chick that you spoke of .
and , being a former tall oaks counselor of the year ... she was hired to be the macro this summer , but she got pregnant .
no doubt due to the tendencies you alluded to earlier .
and i have a great rapport with young people ... so i just stepped in and volunteered .
that cretin is not in our band , and we are not responsible for his actions .
who pissed in your piccolo?
i'm sensing some hostility here .
he poisoned my band .
what?
i'm the macro and it's my job to deal with ...
what is he doing here?
matt stifler is pure evil just like his brother . ... conflict .
thanks , leesy .
she seems nice .
there are rules , of course .
you will have to wear a beanie .
yeah .
oh , i know .
it's a little silly , but it's tradition here ... something you're familiar with , being on the football team , i'm sure ... with your elephant walks and circle jerks and drinking butt beer .
but here , you just have to wear a silly little hat and ...
a somewhat stylish tall oaks t shirt .
yeah .
so , just go with the flow , matt ... and you will have loads of fun ... and you'll be making new friends in no time .
hey , ernie kaplowitz , tenor sax .
cool !
i'm a rookie here , too .
i really wanted to come last year , but computer camp conflicted , and ...
oh , yeah , that was here when i arrived .
i think it has your name on it .
what is it?
hi , welcome to casa de stifler .
i'll be your host , matt .
every day here , i'll make it my sincere goal not to have to kick your ass .
allow me to show you to your new accommodations .
when i'm out here , you're in there .
have a great day , fucko .
i don't ...
okay ...
i'll just go and put this stuff away for you .
all right .
bandee vision .

yeah .

oh , whatever .
he took his own pants off ...
and they stole my clothes .
and i got stuck up there with mrs. doubtfire checking out my ...
let me see if i have this straight .
elyse , you think matt is an arrogant jock who wears his penis on his forehead ... just to gain the approval of his sociopathic brother .
and matt , you think elyse is an uptight , geeky prude ... who needs to loosen up and get laid .
excuse the expression , dear .
is that close to being on the money?
look , kids ... the only way to solve your differences ... is by working together .
so why don't you start tomorrow ... by putting one foot in front of the other?
left flank hut .
turn and hut .
what the fuck !
band 10 hut !
holy shit .
when i yell " band 10 hut , " you snap firmly at attention .
you want to see me firmly at attention?
i already have .
i wasn't impressed .
look ... we've never beaten beechwood , okay?
for some of us , it's our last shot .
just stop screwing up , okay?

yes , speaking of beanies , where's yours , stifler?
you still not following the rules , huh?
let's see .
look .

no standard issue tall oaks t shirt and no beanie .
i believe that's two points from great falls , mr. nelson .

it's on my head , right?
make it five points from great falls .
five points .
man , this place sucks donkey ass .
put your beanie on , son .
five points .
stay still .
stop moving .
he ain't going nowhere now .
this isn't your world .
this is our world , and we don't want you in it .
you already cost us five points in the standings .
we can't have that .
set the man up with his beanie .
now you're representing , fool .
and this toothpaste ... this will make up for the pepper spray , asshole .
oh , shit .
i'll get the paint thinner from maintenance .
animals .
matt , you were sent here ... to make a change .
and , so far , you've only had your sinuses sanitized .
so ...
i think it's time to try a new approach .
make some friends .
earn their trust .
why would i want to earn their trust?
good .
welcome to stifler vision .

awaiting my marching lesson , ma'am .
look , matt , i really don't have time for this right now .
no , look , i figure i'm here , i might as well make the best of it .
matt , marching's hard , okay?
it's not like throwing some football .
oh , you ever thrown into double coverage?
you ever high stepped in double time?
yes , ma'am , the time the cops chased us across koreno's creek .
and you got so scared , you cried .
i had allergies .

your instrument .
that's fucking gay .
i mean lame .
good .
now , there are two positions .
carrying position , like this , and playing position , like this .
now when i call , " horns up " ... you're gonna move your instrument out , and then ...
hello , losers .
matt .
oh , my god .
matt , i am so sorry .
i think i bit a hole in my tongue .
oh , let me see .
no , no hole .
on today's ... episode wasting time on lost causes .
speaking of which , i understand you composed the music to your show , elyse ... if you call that music .
yeah .
that's right .
i did .
and who'd your daddy hire to compose yours?
i'm just giving you fair warning , cupcake .
robards scholarship is mine .
like you need it .
it's not a matter of need .
it's a matter of want .
yeah , i get what i want .
why don't you shut the fuck up?
matt , don't .
what are you going to do?
kick your ass .
are you challenging me?
no .
yeah , what if i am?

i accept .
amphitheatre , 5 : 00 .
it's been three years since i've been challenged .
we got a challenge .
i look forward to reminding people why .
east great falls .
i'll see you there , asshole .
do you know what you just did?
doesn't matter .
he's going down .
matt , you challenged him to a duel .
with swords?
no , you idiot .
you each get on stage and perform .
and the crowd decides who wins .
can't we just do keg stands?
matt , this is serious , okay?
beechwood gets five points if he wins ... which , you know , he will because he plays an instrument .
well , so do i.
let the tall oaks battle royale begin .
the prize is five points towards the cup .
okay , brandon , you're up first .

what's up?
your drum line sounds pretty tight .
oh , thanks .
you let me know if you want to learn some new moves .

thanks for winning those points back .
i lost them .
i had to get them back .
hey , guys , sheree's gonna show me some moves .
hey , gang ... just a little reminder that as the battle for the cup heats up , let's try to remember ... to keep up that tall oaks spirit of fair play and friendly competition .
we'll have enough spit for a six pack .
yeah , baby , you did me proud , son .
thanks , j. lo .
it's cool .
big o?
quite a little show you put on yesterday , stifler .
you know , these plebes think you're some kind of hero .
i don't know what a plebe is , vande creep .
didn't anybody tell you not to mess with the big dog while he's eating?
it's mine , jerk wad .
now will you give it back?
dildos .
this is still my camp , asshole .
you're going down .
no , i'm not .
but your mum did last night .
did she play the trumpet?
because she has really strong lips .
that's right .
yummy .
that's what i'm talking about .
what happened this time , claire?
well , i was working on my solo ... and i hurt myself .
i've been fucking poisoned .
ipecac is a natural herbal extract ... that triggers the regurgitation reflex .
whatever's in there should be out soon enough .
like him , if we're lucky .
well , i'm pretty sure it's probably just something ... you had for lunch , you know?
i've got the same problem .
very sensitive stomach .
i was at a banquet once .
on the same plate , if you can believe it ... they had creamed venison , squid fritters , and jellied pork .
what?
hey , what's up , crust bucket?
come here , dude .
check this out .
so , this afternoon , while the counselors were practicing for the talent show ...
i faked an asthma attack , and i changed both of the cameras .
it's their talent show routine , au naturel .
dude , you filthy little cyberfucker .
shit .
hey , i thought we were just going to watch .
exactly , we may want to watch it again .
hey , so , i took your advice about chloe .
i used the rover to deliver a soda .
that was your cool , crazy idea?
yeah , i think she actually liked it .
yeah , that sounds gay .
it's not gay .
anyway , there's this bonfire slushee party tonight ... and i really need to know step two in the stiffmeister plan .
slushee party .

that's the secret of the ages?
that's step number two?

i know what you're doing .
you do?
it's what you always do .
you're a fake .
you do whatever it takes to be the centre of attention .
just like when we were kids , around me , you were regular old matt ... but around steve and his friends , you were the stiffmeister .
who're you going to be tonight?
hey , cheese dick ... why don't you quit being such a fucking taint licker , and get me another slushee .
fucking puss monkey .
you know what?
i am going to have some fun .
fucking hoes , man .
i don't get that shit .
i mean , right now , oscar's off in the woods tapping that counselor biatch , sheree .
what's up with that?
that cock spring is getting laid?
true that .
and here we are , the two dopest homeboys in camp ... and we ain't got no prospects for our palm pilots .
that's fucked up , dawg .
dude , i gotta see this .
use your hips more .
hips , like that?
yeah , now faster .
yeah .
like that .
a circle .
like that .
crikey !
the alpha female has chosen an unlikely mate .
will he survive this dangerous encounter ... or will she satisfy her primal needs and then devour him for dinner?
stay tuned .
i'm sorry .
i'm really no good at this stuff .
relax .
you're doing fine .
this sucks .
how's that feel?
oscar .
is that your drumstick poking me?
i don't have my drumsticks .
are you standing up for me again , oscar?
it's getting hot .
smack my ass and call me cowboy .
hello , double d sheree .
hips .
hips .
use your hips .
oh , yeah , hips .
and step , and ...
who knew?
wow .
yo , we at tall oaks sipping on juice
got horns , trumpets rhythm and flutes
great falls laying it down
gonna ride fucking beechwood out of the town
j. c. , what , rocking the bunch
all tripped out on the fucking fruit punch
i just want to be respectful .
oh , that's sweet .
the only person who's gonna get laid around here .
hello , oboe .
this is so cool .
i hope i didn't scare you with the rover and the soda .
no , man , it was cute .
nobody's ever been that sweet to me in my whole life .
plus , to be honest ... metal really turns me on .
man , the shit's stuck .
turn off the lights .
damn , gangsta .
i was just fucking with you , dawg !
you ...
it's stuck .
shit , you want help?
don't touch me .
come on .
maybe you should blow on it .
maybe you should blow on it and i'll pull .
hell , no .
jimmy ain't putting his lips on that thing .
jimmy should be a team player .
try and relax , dawg .
not so hard .
oh , my god !
i was just trying to help him get it off , yo .
dude , shut up .
whatever .
he had an allergic reaction to the valve oil .
the swelling should go down in a few minutes .
these kinds of things would never happen with our old macro .
we didn't have mtv when i was growing up .
so maybe it's the over stimulated times ... that we live in that causes young men to stick their ... instruments in such odd places .
i knew a certain young man once ... who actually engaged in sexual congress with an apple pie .
and he turned out just fine .
so , you're perfectly normal ... as these things go .
are you okay?
oh , yeah .
i'm so drunk right now .
i'm probably going to forget about you ... porking an oboe .
i have six piercings .
that doesn't include the ones on my face .
two right here ... and four down here .
haven't seen that in a while .
yeah , well , no time for dance .
it's all about band , band , band .
no , i was talking about you having fun .
i have fun .
i have fun all the time .
yeah .
i just get stressed out , you know .
i mean ... we graduate next year , and i don't know .
i mean , i don't really talk about it all that much ... because the cup is , like , a team thing , and ...
but winning the robards scholarship , i mean , that is like ... my future , you know?
and ...
dr. choi is coming .
i mean ... you don't understand .
she's like famous ...
like holy shit famous .
and , sometimes , i just ...
i get really stressed out ... and i calm myself down by going off and playing on my picardo .
wait , you have ...
picardo?
it's just a cheapie , but i lost it .
wait , if i somehow found this picard thing ...
you found it?
maybe .
give it back .
if you let me watch .
okay , but it takes me a while to warm up .
i have all the time in the world .
figures .
but i'm going to have to be really drunk .
i mean really drunk .
really drunk .
yes .
beat it , jerk off .
okay , people , let's take a break .
we're all a little sluggish today .
man , we suck .
man , one night of fun was not worth losing a whole day of practice .
give me this thing .
all right , listen up , you lazy bunch of lip shits .
those beechwood plebes aren't taking breaks .
we want to win this thing , we've gotta bust our asses .
come on , bitches .
back to work .
matt , that's my job .
grab your cocks and move your socks .
we're at war here , people , war !
show some tits .
grow some balls .
hey , keep that thing warm for me .
all right , now .
what , you want to let beechwood tittie fuck us?
i didn't think so .
all right , tall oakers ... we're in our final week .
time to put on our game faces .
and time to strap yourselves in for a bumpy ride .
i want the oboe , clarinet , black thingies ... and we've got the rhythm section in a full on blitz .
are you with me , bandees?
yeah !
competition for the tall oaks cup is really heating up .
beechwood wins .
whatever .
i told you , you should let me steer .
take that bitch home , man .
drive it in .
hey , you , fuck face , i don't even know where to start with you .
beechwood leads .
great falls and lloyd are tied for second .
beechwood licks nuts .
hut !
victory , east great falls .
right foot on line .
jimmy , you fucking lotion lover .
east great falls by four points .
hey , butt pirates ahoy .
your little band may be leading in the competition , stifler ... but make sure to let us know if you get thirsty .
yeah , 'cause there's plenty of this .
that's funny for you dorks .
yeah , it is , isn't it?
yeah .
man , screw that challenge .
i'm just gonna kick his ass .
no , wait .
i've got a better idea ... if you think you're man enough .
yes .
hey , you sure you can do this?
hey , born to be a porn star , baby .
delivery on demand .
when i get back , i'll be a million stiflers lighter .
brandon , i think you're a really good drummer , so ...
excuse me .
hey , guys ... don't forget your sunscreen .
your bodies are your instruments .
yeah , you don't want to be chapped for your solos .
no , we don't .
bye now .
what is that , 30?
it's really thick .
how's that taste , vande cock?
good , huh?
warm and salty?
yeah .
it's a cum pletely new formula .
100 % stiffy juice ...
s. p. f. 69 .
suck on that .
yeah .
stop , man .
yeah .
ernie .
yeah .
ernie .
what you had before was way better than this .
this sounds like your overactive honor society brain .
instead of your nasty , wet ... dirty girl panties .
it should be more spontaneous .
stop .
maybe you should hang out with your friend matt a little bit more .
yeah , right .
i know he's a dick and everything , but he's also got one .
make some love music , you know?
and then your notes will just cum to you .
oh , matt !
stop .
matt .
matt .
go long , you asshole .
go .
hey , elyse .
throw it back .
come on .
what you got?
missed .
sorry .
hey , if i have to ring the triangle ...
you have to throw the football , all right?
okay .
draw your arm back .
there you go .
shoulder to your target .
right .
okay , now step forward .
come on we're not marching .
one foot .
okay .
you're fine .
ready?
there you go .
draw the ball over your ear ... and when you throw it , let it roll right off your fingers , all right?
okay .
come on , throw it .
see?
i taught you something .
what?
so every time i throw it , you're gonna run and go get it?
that's generally how it works .
like playing fetch with my dog .
yeah , except i don't lick my own balls .
you would if you could .
oh , yeah .
okay , again .
right here .
look , that one looks like a bunny .
no , it doesn't .
maybe a bunny with one nut .
no , that's its tail .
whatever you say .
you think we'll win this thing?
hell , yeah , we will .
lf you write in a bagpipe part .
oh , god , i'll never make that mistake again .
what?
the eighth grade recital .
you made me write in a part for you .
you wore your kilt .
yeah , steve showed up with his friends .
they gave me so much shit for that .
i didn't come out of my room for days .
you made it up to him by stealing all my underwear ... so you could run them up the flagpole .
including my training bras .
okay , since we're having some big fucking oprah moment here ...
i'm sorry about your underwear .
and the diary .
and all that other shit , too .
that's it .
you started it .
this is gonna get me that scholarship .

i don't socialize with bandees .
i'm not a fucking bandee .

i'll leave my pompoms in the window for you .
you're late .
yeah , no shit .

be careful with it .
all right , one condition before i show you the fruits of my labors .
what's that?
i want that picture on that camera phone erased .
nobody at school hears about the triangle or the beanie .
i don't want anybody to think i'm a dorky ass bandee .
fine .
like , now can we get on with it?
as soon as you get rid of that picture of me on your phone .
are you going into town?
not tonight .
i'm too tired .
besides , they're much hotter here .
i know .
it's a great crop this year .
there .
done deal .
now can we see the video?
stiffmeister productions ... in association with its talented new director , matthew stifler ... is happy to premier the unedited ... unfiltered , and un fucking believable bandeez gone wild .
oh , yeah .
oh , my god .
that is unbelievable .
you're kidding me , right?
that's great .
danielle likes jimmy , but she's like a foot taller than him .
and wait till you hear this .
sheree slept with that big oscar guy , the drummer .
said he was amazing .
i hooked up with brandon once .
some drummer .
he has ... no rhythm , and he can't even bang very long .
oh , my god .
are you serious?
yeah , he's a preemie .
i'm not talking about the day he was born , either .
can you get my back?
i think i got a little bit of sun today?
sure .
get this .
he has one ball .
no way .
one ball .
yeah , that why he carries that big stick around everywhere .
it's got his other ball on top .
shit , shit , oh , shit .
what is that thing?
let's kill it .
where'd he go?
there he is .
look out .
this is going into the lake .
no one's gonna know about your little video .
'cause the shit you got us doing on tape ...
so we got a contest to win tomorrow .
and i don't want to see you .
understand?
did you help him?
with east great falls in the lead ...
beechwood has to win the band camp playoffs .
direct yourselves to the marching field in one hour .
now , dr. choi , brandon vandecamp from beechwood ... is our best musician by far ... and his father , landon , is our best donor , also by far .
robards needs talented musicians as much as we need talented donors .
ipecac .
so how's it going?
are you having fun?
it's okay .
how about some ipecac , vande cooch?
this herbal fucking extract will help you beechwood fief play in tune , huh?
shit .
i told you i don't want to see you anymore , stifler .
some day , you'll thank me , asshole .
orange?
again?
damn .
that orange shit is janky .
i'm feeling grape , dawg .
i don't care how many times they won .
they're not getting the grape today .
that's what i'm talking about .
your five time defending champion ...
beechwood academy .
they're tight .
yeah , they're better then ever this year .
okay , everybody .
it's no surprise beechwood is good .
but this year is different .
this year , we can beat them .
we've worked hard , and we are good enough ... and this is our time , so lets win the cup .
yeah !
beechwood academy .
their music today was composed by senior drum major ...
brandon vandecamp .
beat that .
east great falls , you may enter the field for competition .
band 10 hut .
one , two , ready .
shit .
leesy , wait , no .
no .
wait .
you know , i'm so sorry .
i don't know what happened .
not my shoes .
here we go .
stifler !
you know , you're like your brother , steve .
and i don't think those are the shoes you should be so eager to fill .
you know , the people steve thought were his friends ...
really didn't like him very much .
what?
but i think you're different .
i think people want to like you , matt .
you just make it really hard .
parting is such sweet sorrow .
when you're a loser .
mr. levenstein reports that there were a few incidents ... at camp .
but he also says that ... you bonded with the band briefly .
when school starts , you're going to be on a very short leash .
remember , the shermanator sees it all .
be gone .
did everybody hate my brother?
august 21 , 2005 .
some progress made with stiffy junior .
behavior modification evident .
will continue to monitor .
shermanator out .
a little " double d sheree " action .
little bit of dr. robot .
crazy fucker .
hey , stifler , where's your instrument?
dude , you're in the wrong uniform .
screw them , dude .
they're gonna freak out when they see the video .
look , we thought that if we had an advance screening ... then everyone would see that you're not really a dork .
i can't .
it's gone .
what?
the video , man , i deleted it .
why?
guess little bro's quitting the family business .
are you kidding me?
he went fucking bandee on us .
hey , what's up , guys?
you a dead man , motherfucker .
you , too , little man .
wait , wait , wait , wait .
dude , the purple puke was an accident .
somebody switched the coolers .
hey , that orange shit is janky , yo .
chloe , we never saw elyse , you know , naked .
matt turned off the computer .
so we're just supposed to forgive him now?
he's still an asshole .
you're right .
i am an asshole .
i can't take back spying on you ... and i can't win that bandee cup thing .
but i can help someone get what she deserves .
i'm not asking you to forgive me .
just help me help elyse .
i got the number .
go ahead .
555 0171 .
he shouldn't have been dumping ipecac in anyone's cooler .
we could've won on our own .
i don't even care that he saw me on camera .
well , i mean i do , but ...
honey , this just came for you .
it's from robards .
what's it say?
dr. choi wants to meet with me?
okay .
okay .
okay .
okay .
bye .
hi .
elyse houston .
i have an appointment with dr. choi .
you're not in the book .
no , there must be some mistake .
see ...
i have a letter .
this letter is , well ...
it's a fake .
this is not dr. choi's signature .
what?
stifler .
you son of a bitch .
what?
it wasn't enough for you to humiliate me at band camp?
now you have to set me up here?
what's going on here?
this is my band .
and that's her music .
well ...
i've certainly seen some interesting attempts to gain admission ... but this is a first .
excellent audition , miss .
houston .
let's go discuss that scholarship .
i thought brandon won .
no , mr. vandecamp was disqualified for plagiarism .
all right .
that's what i'm talking about , yo .
oh , my god , you guys , that was amazing .
thank you so much .
thank him .
it was his idea .
word .
you planned all this?
with some friends .
come here .
oh , i believe this is yours .
you know ...
picardo is a brand of piccolo .
you really are an asshole sometimes ...
stiffy .
man , change the channel , yo .
hook a brother up with some mad beats .
will you cut that out?
your name is james hi ping chong .
your dad owns a chinese restaurant .
you live in the suburbs .
you ain't never gonna be a gangsta .
damn !
that's cold , dawg .
