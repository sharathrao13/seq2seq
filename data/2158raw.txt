what do you make of this?
what is it?
clive thinks he's found a volcanic pipe .
elementary geology , pal .
there are no volcanoes around here .
ergo no volcanic pipes , and therefore no diamonds .
i don't think i've found a pipe .
i think there's something on this readout that looks like a pipe .
it's weird .
where is it?
about six , seven kliks that way .
jesus !
have you seen anything like this?
it'sjust a bloody lump of sandstone .
maybe some kind of pressure dome .
it's weird , though .
well , let's take some samples and get going .
hey , guys , come and have a look over here .
emergency .
temperature drop .
what's happening?
system failure on the antarctica module .
it's not responding .
primary feed valve's iced up .
i'm gonna activate the bypass .
you work on re routing the secondary .
come on , mel , they've got less than a minute .
zack !
where the hell are you?
we're right here , barb .
hang in there .
mel , find the glitch .
we flight tested this situation a thousand times .
what's happening?
terry's starting to hypotherm out here !
any second now .
mel?
i can't find it !
it's forty degrees below outside !
sequence analyzer to override .
it's not designed for this matrix .
i know , just do it .
the whole system could shut down .
mel , i know .
just do it .
he's going into shock !
just do it !
it's stabilizing , zack .
temperature's rising .
sorry about that , guys .
won't happen again .
for the money , the sooner we replace them with druids , the better .
you're all heart , doc .
good work , guys .
there's a site call out for a systems analyst .
you're it , zack .
shit !
this cannot be happening .
listen , i've got ajackhammer running through my head ... and i think i left my tongue somewhere over the atlantic .
i don't suppose ...
what's that?
tylenol !
cool .
extra strong .
hi .
you look like shit .
it's nice to meet you too .
no , i ...
welcome to hell .
hi .
i'm doctor zack straker .
i'm making a site call at c camp .
apparently i'm supposed to clear security here .
hi .
passport , please .
that water system , was that your bright idea?
yeah , i designed it .
so you're the oke who's got everyone drinking each other's piss?
it's recycled .
the water's distilled .
it's more pure than the snowmelt from the himalayas .
you won't catch me drinking it .
jesus !
fatty nghuza works up at c camp .
enough said .
you okay?
hot , hot , hot .
an alarm went off down on the south side .
another snake in the electric fence .
look at this .
big one , too .
i need to see your case .
that's kinda personal .
call me an optimist .
what's this?
it's charlie .
he's cute .
it's a prototype .
it's a subterranean analyzer .
what does it do?
well , it sees through rock strata and ... it can find water up to a hundred feet deep .
i can do that with a fucking twig , mate .
i hope he lasts longer than the last one .
if you'd like to fill that out .
mikki?
is this what you're looking for?
give it to her .
well , fuck you and the horse you rode in on , pal .
he's one bone headed son of a bitch !
could have handled it myself , karl .
i'm sure you could have .
some prospector have managed to get themselves lost .
i guess it's your lucky day .
thanks .
why , exactly?
the truck's taking emergency fuel up to the zone ... and we pick up the prospectors en route .
how long will it take?
about sixteen hours if we go straight through .
all depends on how long it takes to find them .
is there a problem?
baby , there's no problem when old kurt's around .
so what you doing then?
listen , i do the technical shit ... you drive .
okay?
you riding with us?
yeah .
first time in the desert , i want to see it up close .
you'll get that all right , my friend .
what's with all the fire power?
last month , one of our trucks was hijacked by rebels .
shot up the fuel tanker ... wiped out the driver .
not a pretty sight .
rebels , huh?
they're after the diamonds .
you'll only frighten the poor baby .
all aboard !
how much more of this is there?
from here on in , pal ... nothing but sand and rock for another thousand kilometers .
jesus !
who ever heard of prospectors getting lost , huh?
hey , magda?
which truck did they say was missing?
harvey slater's outfit .
clive is on that truck .
got it , magda .
to your right .
about four o'clock .
ja , that's them .
hang on tight , here we go .
is it clive?
yep .
and i think that's what's left of paul .
you ever done a murder investigation?
so what we do?
call in the police .
they've only been dead for ... six , seven hours , but look at the state of them .
yep .
d'you know who's missing?
probably harvey .
if i catch the fucker , he's dead .
you can't think harvey did this?
i see two bodies .
one missing .
until i speak with harvey , he's it .
hey !
karl !
over here !
titus has got something .
okay , harvey .
we've got you now , boy !
i don't understand .
what?
when we started ... there were two feet .
but now there's four here .
these tracks go on for bloody miles .
it's bizarre .
what are they?
kurt .
go get magda to bring the truck .
they'll pick us up .
don't .
sorry .
a religious thing , huh?
no , not my religion .
they'rejust a warning .
let's get out of here .
let's get out of here .
now .
come on , magda .
he's running !
there's not much left .
i've never seen anything like it .
any sign of a struggle?
not that i can see .
listen ...
i think harvey slater's on the run .
get me some experts up here .
a forensics , or something .
roger .
but it'll take a couple of days to organize .
so get up to c camp for further instructions .
negative .
i'm gonna find harvey first .
if the wind come up , his tracks will be gone by tomorrow .
to the left there , magda , over that dune .
now what?
are you gonna tell me he ran thirty or forty kliks ... then died , then got eaten clean , all in about nine hours?
i'm not telling you anything .
maybe you're confused .
maybe you think these are footprints .
please .
please .
it's impossible .
it's the wrong body , guys .
harvey's back there somewhere .
didn't harvey slater have a motorbike crash a couple of years back?
stuffed up his leg real bad?
he had a limp .
he had a plate .
how are you doing , harvey?
this cannot be harvey fucking slater !
this is a dead end .
we have to retrace our steps .
the guys at basejust said we've gotta stop playing detective .
we've got to get this fuel up to c camp .
there's a killer out there , magda .
if we move up north now , we will never catch him .
it's not our call , karl .
well , you do what you want .
i'm going after him .
it'll be dark in an hour .
we're here for the night .
there's a site call out for a systems analyst .
i don't do fieldwork .
i like the outfit , by the way .
it's natty .
michaela .
but everybody calls me mikki .
i don't understand .
when we started ... there were two feet .
but now there's four here .
tokolosh .
a religious thing?
not my religion .
it's just a warning .
it's just a warning .
so cool .
hey , surfer boy !
you almost gave me a heart attack .
did you see me out there?
you should try that .
maybe some other time .
like in the morning .
oh , shit , i'm keeping everyone up !
well , you and charlie .
damn thing's been beeping all night .
it still needs some work .
it's freezing !
that's the desert for you .
too hot during the day and ... well , it's ... too cold at night .
relax , townie .
body warmth .
stay close , stay warm .
first rule of survival out here .
i think i could learn to like this body warmth kind of thing .
in some countries ... we'd be considered engaged by now .
god ... people still get engaged?
round here , we don't get much beyond the screwing stage .
i ...
relax .
are you and karl ...
we ... had a brief thing .
past tense , huh?
and you?
my work keeps me pretty busy .
i design extreme survival systems .
would you two shut up out there?
i'm gonna head back in .
i think i'll stay out here for a while .
well , don't freeze , all right?
wake up !
wake up , people !
there's something out there !
what?
karl , i'm serious , man .
there is something out there .
oh , come on !
we're in the middle of the desert .
whatever it is you're smoking or drinking , either stop it ... or share it out , all right?
i'm not kidding .
it was as big as a goddamn grizzly bear !
this is africa .
there are no bears !
i know that , karl !
it wasn't a tiger or a rhino or a gorilla either .
what's your problem , then?
my problem is that bigfoot nearly cashed my check !
what !
oh , great .
sleep it off .
what are we supposed to do?
the bones are gone .
what are you talking about?
okay , what's the game?
you'd better tell me right now .
you think this is a game?
what did you do with the bones?
you listen to me , pal .
there is some very weird shit going on out here .
what i just saw ... you think it's impossible?
but i just fucking saw it .
you explain that , then .
i'm a scientist .
i find facts , i collect data ...
and i derive conclusions .
so , start fucking deriving !
what's going on?
i have no idea .
yet .
that's great .
so much for science .
it's a tokolosh .
what is that?
tokolosh?
you know sometimes bad shit happens?
here it doesn'tjust happen .
a tokolosh does it .
you walk into a door , a tokolosh caused it .
you bang your thumb with a hammer .
tokolosh !
a fucking asteroid wipes out the planet .
tokolosh .
karl ... you are starting to piss me off .
it's bullshit , titus .
with a capital bull !
have you ever heard of esikhulu?
what's that?
the sandmother .
she was the first .
and she will be the last .
she takes what belongs to her .
the animals .
the people .
and she drinks the life from their bones .
and this way she lives forever .
brother fights against brother .
father turns against son .
she breaks people ... apart .
come on , people .
let's move it out .
over here .
guys .
got it .
footprints go up the side of the dune .
karl?
karl?
what?
over here .
now we go and catch this son of a bitch .
let's go !
come on , magda .
we're moving .
twenty minutes .
then we can go .
now !
it's dark , karl .
so bloody what?
how are you gonna follow footsteps in the dark?
with your torch?
jesus , magda !
we're trying to catch a multiple murderer .
give us a break , man !
this isn't my call , karl .
and when we can see what we're following , then we go .
until then , this baby stays put .
do you want to radio it in?
does anybody want to radio in and tell the folks back home ... how we've got it all under control?
just over the dune .
magda , kill the engine .
come on .
mikki?
titus .
there !
son of a ...
what the fuck is that?
we've got him .
give me that .
d'you hit him?
what happened?
i heard a gunshot .
nothing .
just a pile of bones .
harvey .
it's the same bones .
what happened , karl?
i don't fucking know , titus !
you catch him?
what the hell is this place?
are you okay?
fine .
you?
no , i'm not okay .
i'm about as far away from okay as possible .
stop bloody whining .
this is way beyond my frame reference .
you should speak to ol 'titus , then .
to him it's all meat and potatoes .
i'm warning you , man .
don't push me .
it can't have gone far .
get this bloody heap going .
check the ammo .
you know what it is , don't you?
when i was a young man ... one of our shepherd boys wandered off .
and a few hours later , his skull was found ... picked clean .
bones that walk .
and flesh that disappears .
you call it whatever you want .
we call it esikhulu .
come on , magda .
let's move .
he's running again .
out !
everyone out !
clear !
what was that all about?
kurt , fix this crap !
well , the battery's okay .
but half the insulation's gone from the wiring .
so , can you fix it?
give me a week and a full workshop , no problem .
somebody better get on the field radio and let the mine know ... that we need some help .
calling eland mine , this is echo zero three , are you reading?
calling eland mine .
anyone out there?
this is echo zero three , is anybody reading this?
the damn thing's broken .
i'm gonna try an emergency beacon .
it's about damn time .
hey , come back !
come back !
he's seen us .
don't panic , china .
they'll send a rescue truck for us in a couple of days , okay?
yeah?
how do you know?
we might look like clowns ... but believe it or not , we actually know what we're doing .
all right , but we're out here for two days .
this is an emergency .
why?
we've got supplies .
they send a truck , we get a tan .
it's better than working .
magda , what have you got in here?
shop said i was a fool , thought i'd never use it .
k rations .
tastes like crud , but it's better than nothing .
are you gonna wear that?
it's gonna be cold tonight .
i'm gonna find a rock .
mikki , go with magda .
who suddenly made you the boss?
it's either mikki or me .
nobody does anything by themselves anymore .
we already have three dead bodies .
jesus , it stinks in here !
titus .
your watch , buddy .
seen anything?
kurt .
kurt?
shit !
karl !
karl !
it's got kurt !
karl !
come here !
what is that?
it's okay .
get him up off the ground .
get him in the truck !
karl , get out of there !
pull him .
help me get him back to the truck .
oh my god !
move it !
they're still coming !
enough shooting .
plan b.
karl , what the hell are you doing?
torch them !
i've got to reload .
i'm not gonna end up like kurt ... and the others .
there's a thousand litres of fuel , karl .
you're gonna take us all with you .
oh god !
i walk through the valley ...
pray hard , sweetheart .
sometimes ... praying just isn't enough .
no , wait .
look !
they're turning away .
see anything?
nothing .
that should steady him .
he's losing a lot of blood .
he's in shock .
we've got to get him to a hospital .
soon .
what else have you got?
in that first aid kit?
i'm gonna go pour out more fuel .
move .
now !
what the hell are you doing?
it's turning away .
let it go !
enough .
if you two want to behave like arseholes , that's fine by me ... but right now , if we don't work together , we're finished .
if i see any more of this crap ...
are we clear?
well ... shooting it wasn't working .
so what are you gonna do?
reason it to death?
buy us some time .
there's a system at work here , karl .
methodology .
you tell that to kurt and titus .
we've got to get him help , fast .
the prospector truck has a radio .
that'll take a good two days .
at first light , we move out .
you want to carry him forty kliks across the desert?
that's gonna help?
what else can we do?
she will ... tear you apart .
leave titus with me .
i can medicate him ... and pray .
oh , enough mumbo jumbo .
i say we all go .
we don't have a choice .
who's we , karl?
i have a choice .
i'm staying .
there's enough fuel in this thing to wipe out anything that might come back .
leave titus with me .
his chances are better if he stays here .
that's one hell of a choice , babe .
you were ready to roast us all back there .
you leave that whisky alone and you start bloody thinking clearly !
the sandmother .
she is searching for her children .
take it easy , man .
not now , titus .
karl .
that thing .
if it is searching ...
i've never seen anything like it before .
maybe he's right .
it's changing and ... it's evolving right in front of our eyes .
the sandmother .
she takes what belongs to her .
then she drains the life from their bones .
she breaks people ... apart .
come on .
where is it?
i'm getting a reading from somewhere there .
that's great .
that thing of yours is useless .
can't even find the water that we're supposed to find .
it doesn'tjust find water .
it also analyses if it's safe or not ... by determining its acidity .
right now i'm getting a reading that's right off the scale .
from what?
ants .
formic acid .
ants have formic acid .
it's what they use to kill their prey .
it's one of the most powerful acids there is .
ants !
look .
what the hell is that?
sandstorm .
take cover .
where?
move it !
there's sand everywhere .
are we all okay?
where's the fuel?
thejerrycan .
it's almost empty .
charlie ...
it's fucked .
so , my friend ... are we .
how much further?
we could go right past it .
he's right .
let's stop here for the night and carry on in the morning .
the prospector's truck can't be far .
we should rest for the night .
well ... this is about as bad place as any .
this gasoline should keep it away .
that's the end of it .
you know ... this petrol will evaporate soon .
yeah .
what's that sound?
it's the sound of the desert .
what?
it's when ... the grains of sand roll against each other .
they create this ... vibrating moan .
what causes the grains of sand to roll against each other?
normally the wind .
there is no wind .
my god !
magda !
it got magda .
what the fuck is that?
ants .
listen .
radio .
that's the prospector's truck .
it must bejust over that dune .
lucky the radio still works .
johan will be here soon .
take a look at this .
karl .
give me your flashlight .
what is it?
i don't know for sure , but ... it looks like some kind of nursery .
a nursery?
for what?
the queen .
what?
that creature .
esikhulu .
it's ants .
the ants on titus ... they were solid , man , like flesh .
that's it !
they just want the bones .
it gives them structure like a skeleton .
when you shot up the sleeping bag , we smashed up the bones .
so then it needed one of us .
but why?
survival .
her home's been busted up .
she can't go anywhere alone .
give her a set of bones ... she can go everywhere .
ants?
that's impossible .
why?
they've been here since before the dinosaurs .
millions of years .
it's like titus said .
esikhulu .
in the heart of the colony ...
lies the queen .
karl?
get out of the hole .
drop your gun .
now !
mikki , drop your gun now .
you're under arrest .
move .
down on your knees .
don't be stupid , johan .
we don't have time for this .
shut up !
they sent me to sort out this mess .
where are the others?
they're all dead .
back up there .
who's dead?
the prospectors .
magda , titus , kurt ...
magda , dead?
bullshit !
listen to us , johan .
why?
you're supposed to be at c camp .
and now you people are all here .
and half you crew's dead .
no one killed anyone .
don't you see?
it's esikhulu .
jesus !
you people are bloody crazy .
i know what happened here .
the prospectors found a diamond pipe and they probably grabbed some stones .
you think we stole the diamonds?
fucking a , pal .
and now i got the whole lot of you .
you're gonna sit for a long time .
nice try , sweetheart .
now , get across there with your boyfriend before i get really cross .
you always were a pig , johan .
was that your secret weapon , karl?
you're gonna have to try a lot harder than that .
get in the bloody truck !
fuck you !
move !
maybe when we get back to the fuel truck ... he'll see what we're talking about and let us go .
this idiot's been itching to take me down .
if he finds what's left of titus and magda ... he'll use that against us .
look and learn , my friend .
look and learn .
karl !
stop !
he'll come around soon .
he'll be okay .
now let's get out of here .
not yet .
we're going after it .
are you crazy?
this is our chance .
mikki , this thing is too unique .
we can'tjust walk away from it .
this thing is a fucking killer !
exactly .
and right now , it's between us ... and c camp .
now , it's looking for a nest .
some place it can ...
start a new colony .
right .
the old evangeline mine .
that's right .
this time we level the playing field .
gently , gently .
nitroglycerin .
hey , what about me?
you?
you can eat shit and die .
you're under arrest for murder !
does it look like i'm under arrest?
i'll get you for this , karl .
i swear !
shit !
just point and shoot .
all right .
it could be anywhere .
we're never gonna see it .
guys .
it's a generator .
forget it .
this place has been out of use for ages .
it's still got compression .
let me see your knife .
you're wasting time , man .
all right , smart ass .
now , let's get down to business .
we have to go low .
the nest'll be buried .
watch your step , guys .
there it is !
mikki .
you want to play hard to get , do you?
karl !
what?
we should stick together .
stop !
get down !
it wants you to go in there .
let it comes to us !
no !
we must finish it now !
karl !
karl , get out of there !
get out of there !
here !
you okay?
not bad for a city boy .
it's got me by the leg !
hang on .
oh god !
we got you .
karl !
hang on !
get out , it's gonna blow .
it's starting to collapse !
it's the queen .
mikki , look !
it's like a giant brain .
the central intelligence .
the walls are moving !
mikki ...
this is the controlling organism .
then let's kill the bitch and get out of here !
kill it !
do it now !
i can't .
we've got to get out of here .
kill it !
kill it !
come on !
run !
it's through here .
are you okay?
i've been better .
it's all right .
it's over .
come on .
oh my god !
johan !
what?
well ... they've isolated that place so well ... there's nothing that can get through .
you know ...
i think i could get into this fieldwork stuff .
does that mean ... you'll be moving round more?
yeah .
i mean , there's plenty of time later to think about settling down .
amen to that .
there's a big world out there .
wouldn't want to paint it .
here .
you should have this .
maybe we should get ...
the spares for the mine .
yeah .
come .
okay , let's put this in the back of the taxi .
are you sure you won't come?
i'm not ready to go back .
they still need me up at the c camp .
fatty nghuza .
take care of yourself , surfer boy .
esikhulu .
