it never happened to us before .
he was a good fireman .
it shouldn't have happened .
he wasn't bringing attention .
what?
you're saying it was dennis 'fault?
would you shut up and wash some dishes , rookie !
you are real good shouting at rookies , man .
fucking asshole .
what a hell is going on here?
i come back from telling a mother that her son is dead !
and this is going on in my house .
in my house !
we deal with this by sticking together .
we take it , we learn from it .
and we get back on a goddamn truck , and that's how we honour dennis !
you got that?
don't you think it might fall apart?
i hope not .
i was thinking about changing jobs .
what do you mean?
it's going search to rescue , pick a truck .
that means you'd be taking dennis 'place?
i can't think that way .
well would you?
captain , this stuff is great .
that's my grandfather .
and that's sample of it .
these are my dad's .
that's him .
one of these he got after he passed away .
this one .
it's medal of honour .
yeah .
so what's going on?
something i wanted to talk to you about .
i was thinking about transferring to a truck .
jesus , why would you wanna do that for?
you're engine man .
truck's a whole different thing .
pulling water between you and fire .
gorge you out and you're lost in the smoke .
it's not a good idea .
yeah , i know that .
i love being on the pipes , it's just ...
just what?
that's what i want , mike .
give it a try .
but you gotta tell me something , if this isn't for you , you tell me right away .
