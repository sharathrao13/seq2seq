japan coast guard
umlzaru
since joining the coast guard , i've witnessed 9 maritime accidents .
each one , however , from the deck of a boat .
each time , i wished i could be in the water .
the 14 of you have come recommended by your regional headquarters ... to undergo special training as search and rescue divers .
only 1 % of all japan coast guard officers earn such a distinction .
it is my earnest hope that all of you will have what it takes to endure ... the most rigorous training of your lives .
attention !
salute !
at ease !
your chief training instructor !
trainees , salute !
at ease !
my name is taro minamoto .
for the next 50 days ...
i will supervise your training .
but first let me say ... my job is not to turn you into divers ... but to sift out the unworthy .
you .

eiji nomura , 2nd region , sir !
why are you here?
to rescue those lost at sea , sir !
and you?

and you?
yuji mishima , 3rd region .
to save human life , sir .
next?
hajime kudo , 1st region .
the same , to save lives .
you?
daisuke senzaki , 7th region , sir .
save lives , of course .
you all sound very noble .
and full of shit !
nomura !
tell me the real reason !
divers ... get the ladies , sir .
tsuchiya !
the divers 'bonus , sir .
kawaguchi !
priority bath rights , sir .
yaegashi !
my superior's orders , sir .
mishima !
to make special rescue corps , sir .
what for?
for the status , right?
kudo !
to save lives , sir !
the real reason !
to save lives , sir .
and you?
boredom on deck , sir .
boredom?
i want to work on the front lines , sir .
you think that's a lot of fun , do you?
senzaki , they tell me you have a master diver's license .
yes .
jerk .
friendly drill sergeant .
50 days with hitler .
i hate him already .
what's a " master diver's license?
it means he's semi pro .
i've been diving since high school .
no way !
you're not the only one with one of those .
10 minutes elapsed !
remember , you're trainees !
you're nothing special !
i've reached my limit , sir !
you have?
kudo ... if you had , you'd be dead now .
you're still alive .
add 2 kilos !
come on .
sink or swim !
keep those hands dry !
ready ... go !
if you can't save your own ass ... how can you save others?
lives are at stake here !
not bad .
senzaki and ...
mishima .
this is heaven !
i thought i'd die out there .
i hope it's easier tomorrow .
food !
i haven't the strength to eat .
look at those two .
they didn't break a sweat .
diving masters .
i told you so .
i wanna go home !
sakai , nakahara ...
muto , tadokoro ...
kudo , senzaki ...
gunji , watanabe ...
tsuchiya , nomura ...
hayashi , yaegashi ...
mishima , kawaguchi ...
meet your " buddy " for the next 50 days .
buddy?
we always work in pairs underwater .
the " buddy " relationships are founded upon trust .
understood?
pleasure .
same here .
one minute and 30 seconds .
one minute remaining .
water clear !
ready ...
dive !
commence gear exchange .
don't waste time !
check your residual pressure .
the slowest pair does 100 push ups .
72 ...
73 ...
i'm sorry .
74 !
500 meter dolphin relay !
go !
the slowest team cleans latrines .
hurry up !
sorry .
what's that stench?
latrines .
now i reek , too .
poor senzaki .
don't get in my way .
i know .
finished already?
i'm not hungry .
eat up !
you need your strength .
that's right .
why'd you pair those two?
they're too different .
it's not fair to senzaki .
you can't pamper a guy like that .
i see your point .
on repeated dives ... you must know how much time you need to depressurize .
your body builds up nitrogen underwater .
once out of the water , you must stay there ... until the nitrogen in your system returns to safe levels .
after a 20 minute dive , for example ... you need to stay out of the water for at least an hour .
otherwise , you're at risk of getting the bends .
why don't you tutor him?
this is where your dive time chart is important .
say you and your " buddy " are left alone at a depth of 40 meters .
you have one tank and 30 bar .
enough for a return trip ... for one .
what do you do?
what?
time's up .
you're all dead .
let me explain the time for reducing pressure after a dive .
what's with that guy?
got your manuscript .
good .
sorry for cutting out on you .
no sweat .
take care of your mom .
it's about ready to print , anyway .
just proof it and email it back to me .
not bad for your first article .
really?
got to go .
bye .
goodbye .
you get used to training after a week .
but barracks life gets harder .
no matter what happens , remember you're in training .
the locals call you " sea monkeys .
because of the way some before you have acted in town .
practice discretion .
understood?
you're free tonight .
abstinence
hey !
what did i just say? !
give me your number !
get away from me .
i haven't got time for a boyfriend .
i'm building work skills .
no interest in men at all?
if the opportunity arises .
wow , tokyo's changed you .
i've hit on a guy , like , once .
you , erika?
how?
i said , " i bet you'd like to kiss me .
i read in a magazine it works every time .
then what?
then i slept with him .
i was piss drunk .
i went out with him for about a year , i think .
really .
coast what?
coast guard .
sea monkeys .
14 of the nicest boys you'll meet !
care for a drink?
pride shattered .
we're getting nowhere !
nobody likes us .
kudo , were you the best your region had to offer?
excuse me?
chief called you the worst recruit ever .
don't make us look bad , okay?
we don't want to fail 'cause of you .
pick it up , okay?
get with it .
sorry .
hold it ...
he's doing his best .
give him a break .
he pisses you off more than anyone else .
so don't act cool .
likewise .
chill out , guys .
sarge will eat us alive if we start fighting .
you don't wanna fight .
neither do you .
coast guard?
every year , they get local girlfriends ... and dump them once training's over .
same old " sea monkeys . " i hate 'em .
two minutes elapsed .
and the winner is mishima !
let's get an interview !
aw come on !
here's the culprit !
nothing's changed around here .
i told you .
i wish i could go to tokyo like you .
you're on call tomorrow , right?
get some rest .
i hate the early shift .
see ya .
good night .
watch it !
i'm packing a lot of stress .
get over here .
two guys pestering one girl?
that's pitiful .
okay , knock it off .
go home !
chill out .
listen to me .
what did you expect?
a girl like you drinking alone .
wait a second .
is that a compliment?
are you saying i'm attractive?
you're wasted .
right now ...
i bet you'd like to kiss me .
get a load of this classy room !
are you new to this?
yeah , my boyfriends have always had apartments .
this feels wonderful !
bright ...
it's too bright .
thirsty?
i still don't know your name .
does that matter?
guess not .
water ...
check .
buddy " ... check .
dive !
hey .
hey !
you've got to be kidding .
you've got to be kidding .
what is this place?
who is this person?
who're you?
who? " is right .
well ... who?
shit !
you're the worst !
i absolutely despise guys that do this kind of thing .
you brought me here .
me?
i don't sleep with guys i don't know .
what?
don't tell me you're with ...
i'm with the coast guard .
i'm late for training .
gotta go .
i just screwed a " sea monkey .
attention !
all trainees present and accounted for , sir !
entering an overturned vessel .
a fishing boat has capsized ... full of fishing nets and other obstacles .
one of you is blindfolded , and you share one tank .
work stops at 50 bar .
under 50 bar , you must surface .
nomura ok .
tsuchiya ok .
6 minutes , 30 seconds .
bar remaining?
30 .
you missed the cutoff .
you've both died in action .
next !
senzaki and kudo .
your " buddy " needs air .
senzaki's down !
he's blacked out !
we've got him !
what's your problem , kudo !
you've got to stay calm .
you almost killed me .
how're you doing , mr. senzaki?
fine .
the doctor will be here shortly to check up on you .
roger ...
latrine?
go out , turn right .
but i emailed you my corrections .
you didn't get them?
wait , i'll try again .
how about now?
got it?
great .
no ... it's nothing .
what?
yes , i can do that .
femme?
don't touch that .
no , i'm fine .
i can work from here .
i won't cause any ... damn !
i can't use my cell phone here .
at any rate , i'll be back as soon as ...
you work for a magazine !
i thought you were a local .
may i have that , please?
why're you working from a hospital?
and who are you?
you remember .
i do not .
i took her to a seaside hotel .
what're you doing?
stop that !
jog your memory?
why are you following me around?
like i said ... it was you who hit on me .
something i live to regret .
and a dorky " sea monkey " at that .
sorry if i fail your high standards .
look , i was drunk .
did i ... really , you know ... " do it " with you?
like a monkey , babe .
creep .
who's he calling a monkey?
couldn't send your article?
don't worry , mom .
you rushed back on my account .
of course i'm worried .
i got it .
don't move .
you all right?
hajime kudo , japan coast guard .
we're both in the business of saving lives .
we're kindred spirits .
kobayashi's stool sample !
gotta go .
see ya later .
ow !
snap out of it .
what're you looking at?
at ease !
10 minutes !
senzaki ... your belt's twisted in back .
blame your " buddy .
what say you , kudo?
i thought i checked him thoroughly , sir .
you've done this repeatedly .
give me 50 push ups .
you too , senzaki .
do it with your regulators on !
you can do it , kudo .
you can do it !
together !
standard operational procedure .
if you can't do it on land ... you'll fail in the water .
keep up , kudo .
sorry .
he's not rescue diver material .
he lacks strength and concentration .
encourage him to quit , or pay for it later .
you know that , don't you?
excuse me !
there're some people on the rocks .
what rocks?
out there .
it doesn't look safe .
what the hell are they doing?
excuse me .
we're the coast guard .
the coast guard?
when the tide rises , you'll be trapped .
please evacuate immediately .
if it gets dangerous , we'll leave .
you've been drinking .
your judgment is ...
buzz off .
who gives you the right to order us around?
and look dorky , too .
that's a cute little life jacket .
orange suits you .
seriously .
it's dangerous .
we hear you .
now leave .
go away !
go away !
hey mishima !
wait !
if they want to die , let them .
say that again?
i said don't be stupid .
my taxes pay your salary , you runt !
kudo !
this is a first .
coast guard officers in a brawl with local civilians !
our apologies , sir .
they were violating public safety rules , sir .
that's right .
that's not the point .
you are public servants .
so get that into your thick skulls !
look what happened to you !
i hear kudo was the first to snap .
mishima didn't lay a hand on them .
that's professionalism .
he's an adult .
kudo's a child .
i'm sorry .
my fault again .
tell me ... just what is our job?
we went to help ... and they spat in our faces .
we got them to leave , didn't we?
you should be pissed off .
back home , my father and brother ... are fishermen .
when they're out at sea in a storm , my mom just sits there and prays .
bring them home safely , " she says .
ever since i was a kid ...
i vowed to rescue them if they were ever in danger .
so you joined the coast guard .
yeah .
i'm glad we helped those people .
mishima ...
i was thinking ...
let's graduate top of our class .
i'll work hard .
all right , " buddy?
why didn't you join the rest?
sir?
you let your " buddy " get beat up .
you advocating fighting , sir?
keep pumping .
you need this to pass pool training .
i'm spent .
shift the weight to your pelvis !
come on !
it's no use .
i can't hack it .
sure you can .
it's pointless .
no , it's not .
you're a basket case , kudo !
time for a skinny dip !
enough of peeing in my wetsuit .
what're you doing?
no fair practicing on the side .
we're in this together .
think of us as ... your trusty " clutch .
you mean " crutch .
disperse !
water clear !
check !
take positions !
dive !
weirdos .
lower your chin , kudo !
so you swallow water , big deal .
raise those hips , man !
you're too vertical .
10 meters to go !
9 ... 8 ... 7 ... 6 ... 5 ...
finish , kudo !
all trainees present and accounted for , sir !
next week , we start training at sea .
and you're not ready .
you faint during training .
you fight off duty .
you think with your peckers .
you're not ready for the sea .
so we're conducting this final pool test .
if you fail any of the tasks today ... you're out !
2 minutes , 30 seconds .
14 minutes elapsed .
one minute left !
paddle !
paddle !
come on !
25 meters to go , kudo !
5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 !
this is your final task .
anyone who can't lift 20 kilos , fails !
almost there .
try again .
i can't .
i can't do it !
it's too heavy .
you're almost there .
i know you can do it .
now go !
you can do it !
keep coming !
keep coming !
don't give up on me , damn it !
keep it coming !
keep it coming !
you did it , kudo !
bottoms up !
nurses !
we've got nurses !
i must be dreaming !
i love you , kudo !
who'd have thought you'd have a hotline to a nurse station?
he was like a raging bull !
went straight for nurse erika .
i wish he'd use that energy in training .
a guy's looks are important .
that's marine self defense .
we're japan coast guard .
our boats are white .
hey senzaki .
thanks .
i owe you one .
save it .
we're only halfway there .
true .
we'll make it , though .
i'm glad you're my " buddy .
i won't let you down .
i promise .
i hate blind dates .
she's a friend of erika's .
i think i'll pass .
but you're my " buddy !
within limits .
no , " buddies " are inseparable .
what a great day for a dive !
the sea looks beautiful !
water everywhere !
hey , isn't that senzaki and kudo?
good afternoon , gents !
what're you doing here?
what a coincidence !
this is a good spot .
mishima's here too?
you knew we were diving here .
leave us alone .
why should we?
look !
hi boys !
now just hold on !
you brought a friend?
this is kanna .
move closer !
gloves on?
your hand , please .
i thought you hated " sea monkeys .
i was bored .
what's a city girl doing here anyway?
none of your business .
in the water , you stay close , you hear?
i hear you .
that was incredible !
it's so beautiful !
told you so .
hey !
keep your hands to yourself .
don't flatter yourself .
my mom's in the hospital .
what?
she broke her leg falling down some stairs .
i see .
so you came back here .
my father died when i was little .
it's just the two of us .
the dutiful daughter .
stop it .
truth is ...
i'm panicked .
this is a critical time at work .
they gave me my first full page at the magazine .
i can't be wasting time here .
so that's why .
what?
why you seem so stressed out .
i must be to sleep with someone i just met .
i'd better go .
hey , where'd everyone go?
still diving , maybe .
let's continue diving , then .
we can't .
