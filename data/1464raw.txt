unless you are a robber , get out .
knockout ned's hlstory
robbery !
the first time ...
bring the revolvers ! ... knockout ned saved a dealer from redhead .
we said no killings .
it's a rule !
we want boss 'money !
open the fund !
do you want to leave?
we also want it .
the second time , redhead saved knockout
ned learned that rules have exceptions .
an exception .
are you the director?
robbery !
everybody down !
i don't play .
whoever moves will be shot !
the third time , the exception became a rule .
with the money from the robberies they would face z .
redhead would protect his busines .
knockout , the best shooter , wanted revenge .
the italian first .
this is 9mm .
it's not aligned .
you 'll get it at a good price .
this is a 12mm .
we call it 'crap '.
uzi , 9mm .
from israel .
david's star .
i want a 30 06 .
it's party time !
the war begins .
lets pray .
our father , who art in heaven . . . hallowed be thy name . . .
gangsters have the guns but they don't shoot .
knockout's one bullet was like ten of z's bullets .
z couldn't stand it .
he attacked .
the ghetto was like hell before but now it had become hell !
i decided to go out .
that's how i became a journalist .
nice picture !
that's rogerio ris 'for sure .
what was i saying?
as every professional ...
i started from the lower level , from the bottom .
without knowing what was ahead of me ...
instead if going home i went to the newspaper's offices .
someone from the city of god worked at the laboratory .
he helped me to fulfil the dream of my life .
rogerio , is the rocket .
photographer .
he is an admirer of yours .
you have a good taste, rocket .
i am leaving .
nice guy !
a personal revenge leaded to war .
the city of god has been divided .
you couldn't cross it .
not to go to a relative .
those who lived to the ghetto were considered as gangsters .
we were living our own vietnam .
volunteers were giving their lives .
the kids .
somebody hit me .
the war was forgiving everything .
one of z's guys kicked me .
take this .
he raped my sister ...
z took our home .
kill for your pride .
i am siago , benny's friend .
you know how to read?
spell?
i am good .
you are hired .
to have revenge on my father's killer .
what's your name?
my name is oto .
what's happening?
he works .
he needs a gun .
he won't last a week .
a year later , nobody remembered how it all started .
the aim was , to undertake enemy's business ... to buy guns and to extend the enterprise .
i sniff , i killed , i stole .
i am man !
the tv showed interest .
the police would intervene .
a gangster from the city of god , was arrested .
manuel massando also known as knockout ned ... is at hospital after an attack of z's gang .
he gave us an interview .
does the war continue?
yes , it continues .
were many people killed?
many .
innocent mostly .
if a person knowns me that's enough for z to kill him .
are the police absent?
they hunt me , not him .
i am in jail while he kills people without thinking .
knockout ned believes that the war will continue .
cops promised to dislocate the gangs .
i am the boss and he is in the newspaper !
did you find mine?
knockout's only .
my name must be somewhere .
can you read?
the pictures .
nothing .
what the hell are you doing?
those are the announcements .
read everything !
there are no articles !
do you want to be shot?
we'll show them who is the boss !
give me the camera !
take me a picture .
i don't know how it works .
take me .

it doesn't click .
you fools .
you fucked me , assholes .
i'll call an acquaintance .

not me .
needs some fixing .
what's your name?
rocket .

with your guns .
you're out , damnit !
speak kindly .
show us the pictures .
we must develop these photos .
how much does it cost?
take this money and bring the pictures .
i have to remove the film .
hold the camera .
benny wanted to give it to you .
it is yours .
don't forget the pictures .
can you develop this film?
i can't , rocket , i'll get in trouble .
i work only for the newspaper .
i'll get fired .
develop this, pierre .
and this .
i am going for lunch .
you are lucky .
dimensions?
for the enlargement .
whatever you think is better .
i am in big trouble .
i am dead .
somebody signed his conviction .
i would smash his face !
you stole my pictures !
they will kill me !
what are you talking about?
they'll kill me because of you !
the pictures were at the laboratory .
everything t hat is in the laboratory is for publication .
i saw them, i published them .
you stole them .
give them to me .
here , take them .
don't you have more?
relax .
what's your name?
rocket?
nice to meet you , marina .
relax .
i've got your money .
when a picture is published we pay the photographer .
do you want to become a photographer?
nice start with a frontpage !
how did you take them?
i live there .
not even one photographer managed to go to the ghetto .
if you bring more pictures of z ... the newspaper will buy them .
can you?
i don't know .
what's the problem?
i can't go there again at night .
and the day?
it is a risk .
at last they understood that i'm the boss .
what's the name of this photographer friend of yours?
he is good .
i'll take to show you .
yes , or not?
it's a big chance .
you took the right decision .
i'll give you films , lenses and another camera .
come to see the equipment office .
there is another problem also .
where am i going to sleep tonight?
i can't go back .
this one is 135mm .
do you shoot from near or from a distance?
can you measure the light?
yes .
don't you think you are too close?
i don't know how i managed to talk to them like this .
maybe i was about to die but i had a camera ... and a chance to become a photographer .
what is more , he had the whole night for us .
do you want to eat something?
no thanks .
won't you eat , or drink?
a joint?
try this .
time to sleep .
i'll show you your bed have you got hot water?
yes , haven't you tried a hot bath?
no .
we got boiling water in a saucepan .
why are you standing there?
in which room am i going to sleep?
unfortunately , i have only one room .
we will sleep together .
i won't tell you much about my first sexual experience .
somewhere else , another one , a more important erotic scene was taking place .
redhead was helping knockout to escape . without a shot .
the guard was at the hands of the nurse .
meanwhile , z was investing on ammo ...
to terminate redhead .
he was heavily equipped even though he didn't have to pay .
do you remember the shotgun?
it is a semi automatic shotgun .
you haven't seen a brouning like this .
it can even shoot down airplanes .
i want what i asked for .
the american r 15 .
they don't exist in brazil .
i don't give a shit .
i've got the solution .
rouger have you seen this before?
like the r 15 .
same calibre but lighter .
with infrared vision?
400 blasts per minute?
are you trying to fool me?
i'll fuck you .
go now , no money no guns .
what am i supposed to say to the boss?
your problem . think of something .
beat it , fatty
z made a big mistake he didn't know that ...
behind every dealer there is a big trader .
did you see this?
why do they want an r 15?
they will make investigations , cops . we'll get busted .
do you think that i will betray you?
i'll fix it , but don't get involved again .

i went three times to jail while he kills undisturbed .
they don't arrest him .
knockout ned claims that the war will be continued .
police officers promised to take down ... both gangs at the city of god .
