but professor  no .
the answers are all there in the test .
aren't you forgetting something?
i know .
it's something to do with the third differential coefficient .
not that , tonight , what?
emma?
what time is it?
almost 5 : 00 ,
oh , god .
my proposal for utilizing solar power , rejected ,
my concepts for harnessing micro energy waves , rejected ,
the dean suggests that i focus on something that might actually help mankind ,
like his study on the benefits of tobacco consumption , [ man # 2 ]
alex , the problem is your ideas are a bit too ... radical , [ alex ]
the problem is with the faculty .
they're dinosaurs .
they're already extinct ; they just don't know it .
they'll be discovered by some future archaeologist , and he won't know what to make of them .
their dim little eyes , devoid of any curiosity
alex , it's your first year as associate professor .
you might want to play things a little more conservatively .
you sound just like my father .
look at them , philby .
all alike .
all in identical bowler hats .
do you want your students to turn out like that?
i want my students to be prepared for the realities of the world they're about to greet .
well , i don't .
i want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see .
mrs. watchit !
oh , huzzah , the master's home .
did you get it?
hello , mr. philby .
hello , mrs. watchit .
you're looking in the pink .
must be all the exercise i get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lad .
don't torture me .
did you get it?
i got it .
good .
let me see .
but don't you think for one moment ...
i'm going to let you go out in that filthy jacket .
now , go in there and change .
and you've got another letter from that annoying little man .
well , go ahead , switch it on ,
it'll help people keep their teeth well into their 40s ,
you might think about having that cleaned .
oh , who has the time?
how did you know with molly?
know what?
you were meant to be together .
she made the best shepherd's pie i ever tasted .
don't you have a single romantic bone in your body?
no .
i'm all bowler hat .
why do you waste your time on that crackpot?
because he has some very interesting ideas .
a professor at columbia university should not be corresponding with a crazy german bookkeeper .
he's a patent clerk , not a bookkeeper .
i think mr. einstein deserves all the support i can give him .
i wonder if we'll ever go too far?
with what?
with this .
with all of this .
no such thing .
all right .
how do i look?
practically decent .
really , alex .
good luck tonight .
she's a fine girl .
she's done wonderful things for you .
don't worry .
you still have that alluring smell of chalk .
oh , gotta hurry .
now , that's more like it .
you look a proper gentleman for once .
well , you better hope so .
if emma turns me down , you'll be next .
oh , i'm already swooning .
all right .
wish me luck .
thank you .
fresh flowers .
fresh flowers .
have some flowers , sir .
not tonight , thanks .
no .
i promised her flowers .
spectacular .
spectacular waste of money .
damn thing's always breaking down .
do you need a lift?
yes , yes .
how do you keep the water temperature stable?
there's a cantilevered gasket ...
on the fuel regulator  [ revs ]
oh , god .
uh [ blows raspberry ]
much obliged .
i'm always forgetting the damn brake .
hop in .
i'll give you a perambulation before it breaks down again .
oh , uh , i'm afraid i have a prior engagement .
well , another time then .
we perambulate here most every night .
certainly .
get a horse !
yes .
alexander?
oh !
whoa .
you're late , professor .
i got here as soon as i could .
well , they say it's all the rage in paris .
but i just picked it up
five dollars at macy's .
silly , isn't it?
very silly .
i like it .
well , where are they?
what?
the flowers .
you promised me flowers tonight .
don't you even remember?
oh , i'm sorry .
i well , i was distracted .
well , there's something new .
uh , emma , i need to talk to you .
oh , uh , shall we walk through the park?
yes .
professor , you're shivering .
i hope you're not coming down with something .
well , i'm afraid i am .
i'm not sleeping very well , and even when i'm awake , i'm not much use .
i can't eat or think or do much of anything anymore .
and the worst part is , i don't know that i'll ever be well .
i think there's only one remedy , and that's for you to marry me ...
and spend the rest of your life with me .
oh , emma , i know it's right .
i know we're meant to be together .
it's the only thing in my entire life i've never had to think about .
oh , alex .
uh uh , wait .
i have something for you .
you know , the moment is rather dying here .
i i know .
hold on .
oh .
i know it's not a diamond .
a moonstone .
well , it's your birthstone .
i thought
you thought right .
i just might cry ,
i couldn't help but overhear .
two fine young people starting out on the road of life .
i wish you the very best .
well , thank you .
and as much as i hate to do this moved as i am by your ... protestations of love
i'll be needing your money now .
sir?
and your jewelry too .
i guess we could call this your first little bump on the road to marital bliss .
i don't understand  don't make a scene .
there's no cause for that .
just give me your wallet , will you?
hmm?
did you hear me , lad?
uh , all right , all right .
here .
that's everything .
and your watch .
and the gloves .
and the ring .
no .
i'm afraid so , darling .
and maybe he'll buy you a diamond now .
please , please .
not that .
don't !
why did you do that?
it's only a ring .
emma?
emma?
oh !
what?
oh .
oh , sir , mr. philby's here .
here?
yes , sir , he insisted on coming
tell him to go away , i'm busy , i won't go away , alex .
my god .
what's happened to you?
i've been i've been working .
you remember that?
you used to care about your work .
i care more about my life .
and yours .
i came by the house every day after the funeral ... and every week and every other month .
then i stopped coming .
did you even notice?
it hurt me , alex ... very much .
then why are you here now?
there are some things i have to say you may not like hearing  i know .
i know .
you're concerned .
i know .
i hear it from mrs. watchit every day .
but really ...
i need you to go .
i won't leave .
not with you hiding down here .
i'm not hiding .
you know that's what it is .
mrs. watchit says you're in here all hours day and night .
alex , will you please stand still and look at me !
it wasn't your fault .
no .
it wasn't my fault .
maybe we should blame mrs. watchit for picking up the ring from the jeweler .
or the jeweler for making it .
or the poor bastard who tore the stone from the earth .
maybe i should blame you for introducing me to emma in the first place .
yes .
alexander , nothing will ever change what happened .
no , you're wrong , because i will change it .
david , i appreciate your concern .
i do .
but i ask you to have faith in me .
well , i i want to have faith in you , alex , but
wha what are what are you doing here?
i'll tell you what .
why don't you come by for dinner in a week , and i'll show you?
why don't you come home with me now?
molly  did you not hear me , david?
i can't leave when i'm so close .
all right .
we'll continue this conversation in a week .
in a week , we'll never even have had this conversation .
ah .
thank you , my good man .
you're early .
that's a first .
i wanted to see you .
well , where are they?
what?
the flowers .
you promised me flowers tonight .
don't you even remember?
you never cease to surprise me .
emma , i need to talk to you .
shall we walk through the park?
no !
no ,
no .
let's go into the city .
alex , what is it?
nothing .
let's just hurry .
running along is all very well for you .
you're not wearing a corset .
bleecker street , and be quick about it .
now you're all gallant .
professor , you're shivering .
i hope you're not coming down with something .
no , no .
i'm fine .
i'm wonderful .
i'm walking down the street with you again .
but we took a walk three days ago .
well , not like this .
never like this .
heavens , look at that car .
oh , i've seen it .
now i know you're ill .
you're passing up the chance to explore some new gadget .
it's only a machine .
alexander , tell me what's going on .
is something wrong?
no .
no .
emma , listen to me .
i need to leave you now , but i want you to go straight home and stay there .
i promise you i'll come by sometime later tonight , and i won't make any sense .
i'll be all upset that you didn't meet me in the park , but you must trust me .
everything will be all right .
just know how much i love you , how much i'll always love you .
all right .
but first , where are my flowers?
flowers it is .
wait right there .
don't move .
oh , can i help you , sir?
yes , a dozen roses .
white .
no , no .
red .
look out !
easy .
easy .
i'm looking for professor hartdegen .
alex , i'm i'm so sorry .
this was not supposed to happen .
of course not .
i know there's nothing i can say .
we were out of the park , philby .
we were safe .
why can't i change it?
i could come back a thousand times .
see her die a thousand ways .
i don't i don't understand .
i can't find the answer here .
not here .

i don't understand you .
do you know my words?
yes .
the lex .
the stone language .

but do you understand me?
do you understand me?
we all learn it when we're young ,
they tor'jen .
forget .
they forget it .
but i teach , [ foreign language ]
what is he saying?
they're trying to decide if we should throw you in the river .
tell me quickly , and tell me the truth .
where do you come from?
well , actually , i'm from here .
uh , just not from now .
you see , i built a machine that allows me to travel through time .
i'm from the past .
oh .
i told them you hit your head ... and you are a wandering idiot .
what are you doing?
getting ready for the mor ,
the night .
oh .
i'll come with you .
eloi?
what are your people named?
well , i i guess you'd call us new yorkers .
new yorkers .
are they friendly?
until you talk to them .
tell me about your village .
it's a very busy place .
everyone seems to be in a hurry .
and they all wear identical bowler hats .
little black round things on their heads .
what do you do there?
well , i was a teacher like mara .
and i make things , [ boy ]
me also ,
i made a sess'quin'tan with my father .
we still use it .
a sess'quin'tan?
mara , der'enjen'wenlen?
sess'quin'tan .
steps of rope .
oh , a rope ladder .
we can make one .
i will teach you .
will you tell me more lon'el on the next day?
tomorrow?
yes , i will .
why don't you take care of this for me tonight?
thank you .
good night .
good night .
kalen will tire you if you let him .
he's always been questioning .
our parents were firm , but it is his way .
where are your parents?
they've gone from this place .
oh , i'm sorry .
you were right , philby .
i did go too far .
sit with me .
mara , why do you pull the boats up at night?
afraid they'll be stolen?
stolen?
i do not know that word .
well , are you afraid that someone will take them?
it is just more safe this way .
oh .
you must do things to be safe where you come from?
of course ,
or when you come from .
ah , so i'm not just a wandering idiot .
col'mar ,
maybe we could find some tomorrow .
flowers?
alexander , alexander ,
ah !
morlock !
is he all right?
he had a dream .
oh .
so did i.
i was moving through a jungle
and you saw a shape ahead of you .
well , a face that ... called my name .
we all have that dream .
all of you?
yes .
now go back asleep .
you're still not well ,
what does that mean , " morlock "?
a child's dream .
no more .
go back asleep ,
we keep these stones in many places ,
this is the room where my parents taught me for the first time .
why do you learn this language if you don't use it?
it's a tradition we hand down .
it meant something once .
must be here for a reason .
one generation passeth away , and another cometh .
but the earth abideth forever .
why have you come here?
why have you traveled through time?
to have a question answered .
question?
yes .
why can't i change the past?
why would you want to?
you've lost someone .
some one you loved very much .
mara , why are there no older people here?
what do you mean?
older people , your parents 'age or grandparents 'age .
they've gone from this place .
you mean , they're dead?
yes .
all of them?
how is that possible?
there are things better left not said .
we don't dwell on the past , alexander .
we do something else .
what?
we remember them ... with these ,
alexander !
alexander .
are you coming to work now?
come with me  [ mara ]
no .
alexander's not well enough .
we're going to see his machine .
now?
stay with toren .
go the next day , tomorrow .
i need to see that it's all right .
this way .
will you tell me more about n new york tonight?
i will .
oh , good .
it seems fine .
we had quite a ride together .
it's ready?
appears so .
will you use it now?
go back to your own time?
well , i i guess i could .
uh ... it seems so long ago .
no .
you should go .
will you take kalen with you?
why?
alexander , take him away , back to your time .
will you?
mara , why?
please .
you don't know .
take him away from here .
kalen !
mara , what's going on?
they're early !
we must get kalen !
kalen !
kalen !
kalen !
mara !
kalen !
no , stay here .
stay in the group !
run !
mara !
mara !
where did they take them?
we have to follow them .
we have to find them .
we do not .
col'quin tor ,
why not?
this is nem eloi'tas , our life here .
how can you just do nothing?
how can tor'tasal'mor ,
it is the day and the night .
the day and the night .
this is the world .
why don't you fight back?
fight back .
why not?
those who farquil'pax ... fight are taken first .
kalen , do you know where they're taken?
no .
do they ever come back?
no .
has anyone ever followed them?
i don't know .
well , what about the morlocks?
there must be a leader .
we're not supposed to talk .
kalen , listen to me .
listen .
sometimes we need to accept what's happening to us even if we don't want to .
and other times we have to fight , even if we're afraid .
now , it's difficult to understand , i know .
believe me , i know .
now , they're afraid , and i'm asking you not to be .
so will you tell me what you know?
we can save her .
please .
when they go , we're not supposed to talk about it .
but we all know the place .
what place?
where the ghosts are .
here it is .
welcome to vox system .
how may i help you?
it's all right .
how may i serve you?
what can i get you?
oh , let's see .
um , henry james .
oh , no .
yes?
no , no , no , too depressing , hemingway , perhaps?
no , too sweaty ,
plato , proust , pinter , poe , pound?
no .
complete works of martha stewart?
ah , i have it !
jules verne .
right up your alley , i would think .
photonic , right?
or what's left of one .
what's left of all of them .
i am the last , and " these fragments i have shored against my ruins .
t. s. eliot .
you wouldn't know him yet , but he is so depressing , yet so divine .
oh , i'm sorry .
the lending library is temporarily out of service .
not to worry .
i have them all right here every page of every volume .
can you tell me what's happening here?
well , my sources are no longer fully annotated , and my information is somewhat anecdotal , but i believe what was once one race ... is now two .
one above and one below .
two distinct species that have evolved .
and how do those below survive?
that is the real question , isn't it?
i don't believe it .
well , if you don't like the answers , you should avoid asking the questions .
look at them .
they have no knowledge of the past , no ambition for the future ,
so lucky , why would you say something like that?
can you even imagine what it's like to remember everything?
i remember a six year old girl who asked me about dinosaurs 800, 000 years ago .
look homeward , angel , by thomas wolfe .
and yes , i even remember you ,
time travel : practical application .
how do you know about the morlocks if you can't leave this place?
there was one eloi who managed to escape , he told me everything ,
we spent years together , just talking .
the conversation's a little spotty now , but i do remember .
it's good to have a friend .
then you can help us find the morlocks , find mara .
and if the truth is so horrible , and will haunt your dreams for all time?
well , i think i'm used to that .
my friend said he came from the east , from the jungle .
will you describe it?
i don't have to .
just follow the breathing .
in the dream , we're moving toward it , but i think it was meant to keep us away .
i might just go in by myself .
no .
mara would be very cross with me if you got hurt .
now , i'll find her , but i need you to go back to the village and light a fire so we can find our way home .
all right?
will you do that for me?
i lost your pocket watch .
they took it from my room .
i'm sorry .
why would they take it?
oh .
stupid .
mara?
mara?
mara .
mara?
come a little closer .
i don't bite .
do i surprise you?
a little .
yes .
hmm .
we weren't always like this .
after the moon fell from the sky , the earth could no longer sustain the species .
some managed to stay above ,
the rest of us escaped underground ,
then centuries later , when we tried to re emerge into the sun again , we couldn't ,
so we bred ourselves into castes .
some to be our eyes and ears .
some to be our muscles and sinews .
you mean , your hunters .
yes .
bred to be predators , but bred also to be controlled .
you see , my caste concentrated ... on expanding our cerebral abilities .
you control their thoughts .
not just theirs .
the eloi .
so it's not enough that you hunt them down like animals .
that's their role here .
to be your food?
yes .
and for those who are suitable , to be breeding vessels ... for our other colonies .
you see , i'm just one of many ,
i don't understand how you can sit there and speak so coldly about this .
have you not considered the human cost of of what it is you're doing?
we all pay a price ...
alexander .
don't worry .
you're safe .
i control them .
without that control , they would exhaust the food supply ... in a matter of months .
food supply?
they're human beings !
who are you ... to question 800, 000 years ...
of evolution?
this is this is a perversion of every natural law .
and what is time travel but your pathetic attempt to control the world around you , your futile effort to have a question answered?
do you think i don't know you , alexander?
i can look inside your memories , your nightmares , your dreams .
what if?
look at you !
and a long ponytail  daddy !
who's that?
is it daddy?
daddy !
long ponytail , [ girl ]
and we're still having lots of fun ,
right , right , [ child chattering , indistinct ]
da da !
daddy .
you built your time machine because of emma's death .
if she had lived , it would never have existed .
so how could you use your machine to go back to save her?
you are the inescapable result ... of your tragedy , just as i ... am the inescapable result ... of you .
you have your answer .
now go .
i believe you have something that belongs to me .
we all have our time machines , don't we?
those that take us back are memories ... and those that carry us forward ... are dreams .
you're forgetting one thing .
huh?
what if?
what are you doing with it?
changing the future .
come on .
wait .
wait here .
go .
hurry !
huh?
alexander !
i'm sorry you lost your machine .
oh , it's all right .
it was only a machine .
the congregation rose and stared ...
while the three dead boys came marching up the aisle ...
tom in their lead , joe next ,
and huck , a ruin of drooping rags ,
" sneaking sheepishly in the rear .
they had hid in an unused gallery , listening to their own funeral sermon .
aunt polly , mary and the harpers threw themselves upon them
this is the place .
so it is .
but there's nothing here .
well , it was different then .
my laboratory was all around here .
the kitchen was up there where that tree is .
not that mrs. watchit ever let me go in there .
i don't know what to tell you , sir .
he's been gone this whole week .
and you've no idea where he went?
no , sir .
this would be my greenhouse ,
there was a garden outside .
gren 'tormar'tas?
yes .
i'm glad .
sir?
i'm glad he's gone .
maybe he's finally found someplace where he can be happy .
this was my home .
his home .
long ago .
you know , molly and i were talking about engaging a housekeeper , someone to live with us and help take care of jamie .
would you be interested?
perhaps just until the master returns .
of course .
but there'd be some changes made .
i run a tight house .
oh , i have no doubt of that .
i'll call by in the morning , and we'll arrange it .
good night , mrs. watchit .
good night , mr. philby .
godspeed , my fine lad .
godspeed .
