an intermediary but necessary step ... before becoming man's perfect complement : a woman .
do you iike it?
can you give me a definition of grace?
i'm not smart .
smile then .
that'ii be a good start .
smile when you don't know something .
you won't be any smarter , but it's nice for others .
ailow yourself to be taken over by the faint fragility ... which wiii make your face beautiful .
a smile .
a smile ... is surface sweetness .
gentleness .
almost a mood .
