soda got her name because she laughs like soda bubbles popping .
we shouldn't have called her by such a name .
the popping smiles
popped and disappeared .
all there?
aren't you missing one?
you knew?
i didn't intend to .
then , lay off .
why do this?
i was asked to .
you can refuse .
i just deliver .
part of my work .
work?
you call this work?
i don't understand .
you don't have to .
doesn't concern you .
and your dream?
what happened to it?
this is for my dream .
i can be supervisor .
if i get my work done
i can be supervisor .
so , this is my work too .
i can have my own flower shop .
who do you give it to?
don't know his name .
you suck .
i don't use it .
it's the same .
no , it isn't .
some want to buy , some want to sell .
we all live only for ourselves .
nothing wrong with that .
want to live in my own way .
that's all .
i do this for that .
it doesn't suit you .
it really doesn't .
realizing a dream that way is meaningless .
so what?
that's not a dream .
you?
of all people?
you talk about dreams to me?
alive or dead , you don't care .
how can such a person lecture me?
i have a dream .
i'm better than you .
you don't even want to live .
i can't waste time choosing my method .
you're right .
you're better .
i had a girlfriend .
she died .
she never took any drugs in her life .
but that's
what killed her .
my girlfriend died .
she was hit by a car , driven by a junky .
she died ... just like that .
she was a citizen of this country but she decided to live in my country .
she died the very day she came to my country to live with me .
you may be better than me .
but you certainly suck
buy your dream with others 'misery .
alive or dead , you don't care .
dream?
you don't even want to live .
soda ...
she's leaving here .
i'm so sorry .
was she alright?
are y ou crying?
of course not .
doc ...
doc ...
you get on my nerves .
your work dumped you .
wlfe dumped you .
why does a loser like you get to stay?
boy .
you make me sick .
put it away .
put that away .
who do you think you are?
what can you do?
i can do any thing
too bad for you , but i'm strong .
you're a hit man?
you've got no guts to kill any person .
sure i do .
but you don't need guts .
what?
what're you afraid of?
you're a wimp .
me?
a wimp?
say that again
relying on a gimmick .
what do you mean?
can't do anything by yourself?
you little wimp .
do you think killing a person makes you strong?
saying that from experience?
put it away .
no way .
stop it .
both of you .
stop treating me like a kid .
i'm a man .
boy .
i think you're really scared of me .
you're scared of me .
sal .
sal .
doctor .
please hurry .
doctor .
is there a doctor?
isn't there another ...?
payment by cash each time .
bu let missed the vital parts .
but ...
the bleeding's tough on the child
she needs blood transfusion .
please do it .
using your blood would cost less .
wrong blood type .
i'm not her father .
i'm sure you knew .
i'm glad it wasn't serious .
what does it mean to be strong?
i don't know .
many think
hiding their fears make them look strong .
we're a weak .
i'm weak , too .
a contract
i killed someone
so i'm a fugitive .
i killed sal's mother .
i loved her .
she worked , and raised sai all by herself .
she was so sweet , it was almost painful .
we got an apartment , and the three of us began to live together .
sai came to like me , too , and we were happy
it didn't last .
she fell ill .
how could such a ...
i can't believe it .
she asked me
to kill her .
she said she didn't want to become ugly , and wanted to
stay beautiful for me .
saying so she cried .
how can ...
i said " let's live and cure it together .
i don't care how you look .
i said all i could think of .
what do you think she said?
she said i was cruel .
what is it to be strong , and what is it to be gentle?
i didn't know .
and chose the one that wouldn't make her sad .
so i strangled her .
and sal?
who is to blame for losing her mother?
even a child understands .
she won't talk to me .
eventually , she ended up talking to no one .
she hates me .
can't blame her .
but ...
i can't leave her by herself .
after 10 years , she'll be able to live all by herself .
i'll take my punishment then .
i'll pay for it all my life .
but until then
i can't leave her alone , even if she hates me .
what about you?
why are you here?
after that we had a very , very long talk .
i even told him things i only told venus .
about my glrlfriend's death .
about how i never saw her body because her family didn't let me .
dumb , isn't it?
i was cooking , and kept on waitng for her .
i learned about her death in the paper the next day .
said i was to blame , and threw me out .
my name is chonan .
go away .
please ...
i beg you ...
let me say goodbye to her .
she died because of you .
you killed her !
my daughter died because of you .
please , sir , wait .
i want to see her ...
go away .
i blame you for her death !
don't ever come here .
i couldn't attend her funeral .
i should've gone to plck her up .
shouldn't have invited her to my place .
she might be alive now , if she had never met me .
i told guy about how time stopped moving for me , then .
no matter how much i miss her or get angry at myself or hate some junky i don't know
my grief is unbearable .
i have not had a chance to apologize or bid her farewell .
wouldn't they even tell you where she was buried?
the letters i sent to her parents were all returned unopened .
i see fewer stars .
but the numbers are the same .
lit by starlight , we hope to see all .
but s nce we feel insecure we only see the things around us .
when we shine the light around us to see more we can't see the stars faraway .
the stars are there you just can't see them .
and soon you won't see the stars you considered markers .
life is like that .
anybody's life ... no matter how trifling it may be , has a back you don't want to show to others .
you may call it failure or remorse or whatever but we all try hard to live our own life .
we try hard to walk proud .
but when you try to walk proud your back screams in pain .
the more you struggle the heavier the load on your back becomes .
you want to give up and lie flat on the ground .
he's very good .
it's not a difficult operation .
it's tough to live on with a load on your back .
but it's strange .
only from those backs will you always see wings grow out
if you keep carrying heavier loads someday you'll be able to fly high .
the ones living here are such people .
you don't care if you're alive or dead?
drop dead , chonan .
can't decide?
being unable to decide means you want to live .
if you really want to die you'll be dead before you think .
if so , it'll be easier to decide to keep on living .
tell yourself you're going to live .
sal ... she's gone .
i'm sorry .
i didn't know .
doctor ...
how is he?
you know ...
i don't have any dreams of my own .
but i was happy because his dream was my dream , too .
but
when he despaired , i despaired , too
what have been seeing all these years?
i blamed every single thing on him .
even my unhappiness
i blamed that on him .
too .
he was with me ...
it's hard to be happy in a normal way .
i'm sure he's waiting for you .
without you ...
delivery for venus .
boy .
soda ...
she got away .
but i beat him to a pulp .
that scumbag manager .
doctor .
get hot water .
tools must be sterilized .
let's take him to your room .
venus .
if i fail , you must forgive me .
venus .
to be strong ...
what is that?
you foolish boy .
such a foolish boy .
get to work .
hurry up
you're a man , aren't you?
stethoscope .
he'll make it .
only a few broken bones .
i ...
i'll i make it too .
any towels around?
i'll get some , doctor .
thank you .
mornings sure are chilly
but i love this breeze .
yesterday's flower will be all right , too .
the seeds will ride the wind .
and bloom again around there .
even anemones won't bloom so quickly .
does it hurt?
shouldn't have walked .
deep inside
weren't you happy?
that anemone ...
you broke the pot .
i think
guy wanted to hand it to you himself .
you wanted him to do that too , right?
you would have been more upset if he had .
guy and you are not real father and daughter , but you two
are so much alike .
you're both quite stubborn .
we're all alone .
that's how it is
because of that , when you're with someone you can feel the happiness .
you can be stubborn because there is someone
guy's looking for you
wait .
what's going on?
wait .
what is this?
i said wait .
just a little while .
please .
came to pick up garbage at the dump .
you should say " thanks for cleaning up .
what garbage?
this sure is a garbage dump .
doctor .
wait .
venus .
damn you .
venus , are you okay?
wait .
you piece of garbage .
what the hell .
you scumbag .
stop it .
you're pretty ...
dirty bastard .
come on , let's get out of here .
damn you .
hey , nobody here is garbage .
we are alive .
we all have a life .
guy ... sal ...
soda ... boy ...
doctor ... wlfe ... venus ... duster ...
no matter what happens ...
no matter what we carry or even if we can't carry ...
we are all alive and kicking .
wait .
please wait .
damn you .
thanks .
eat your fill .
for you .
it's from soda .
what does she say?
says she's well .
still treats me like a kid .
don't be harsh on her .
shut up , old man .
you mean old woman .
shut up , old woman
i'm a man , actually .
what is this?
sal .
what's " anemone "?
what?
i'll mail this
duster .
no need to .
i'll hand it to this person myself .
i'm alive ... in this town , whlch is my destination as well as my starting point
the days i live are slightly different each day .
excuse me .
you have tea?
any cola?
venus blend .
just one .
chonan .
sai flew .
i could see on sal's back little wings grew out , and captured the wind .
sal , can you do me a favor?
what?
can you mind the cafe?
where are you going?
will you come back?
of course i will .
deal?
it's a deal .
here , speak our language .
that's the least you can do for us , living in this town .
things happen if you're alive .
or rather ...
we live because many things happen .
am i right , venus?
hi .
how are you?
