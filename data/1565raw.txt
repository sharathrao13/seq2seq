don't you know better than to disturb a man at work?
i wouldn't interfere but you have an order to get back to hq .
for what?
don't know , sir .
no , i go , baby ...
yes , i come back , baby .
don't you worry about that .
i'm not going to take it , not for one by god minute .
i've sweated marbles over this ill advised , premature operation .
i can't work miracles with the material they've given me .
i'm gonna lay it on the line with cincpac .
don't do anything hasty , admiral .
hasty?
torrey'll be on gavabutu in three days .
do you want me to be a doormat , with " welcome " written on my backside?
well , of course , you know best , but ... ... if torrey flops , you can blame cincpac for putting him in there .
and if we get some action out of the gavabutu personnel that they haven't produced for you , you're still the area commander .
you'll get the credit .
area commander or not , i won't know what he's doing till he's done it .
i'll be sitting here on toulebonne and every journalist in the islands will know .
that's simple .
you need sort of a ... a representative in torrey's camp who can keep you informed about what's happening .
yes , that might help .
sir , commander eddington has arrived .
you're eddington?
yes , sir .
in charge of piers and warehouses?
that's right , sir .
i sent for you two hours ago .
what kept you?
i was recruiting native labour for piers and warehouses , sir .
that doesn't mean you have to look like a native , does it?
i didn't expect to be called to see the admiral , sir .
didn't you see the directive that all personnel be clean shaven?
i must have missed it , sir .
did the admiral want to see me about my beard?
eddington , you're being transferred to gavabutu , with the rank of captain .
are you sure you have the right eddington?
you're being assigned to admiral rockwell torrey as chief of staff .
that's all .
admiral torrey?
yes , sir !
thank you , sir !
well , if that's a sample of torrey's staff ... !
you suggested i needed a representative on gavabutu .
ok , you're it .
you'll be my liaison officer , we'll call it .
i don't have any combat training , i don't think ...
don't crawfish , it was your idea .
some forward area duty might be just the thing .
think what a combat ribbon or a purple heart would mean to you .
worth half a million votes when you run for office .
let me be the first to welcome you to this land of milk and honey .
colonel gregory , paramarines .
pleasure , sir .
egan powell , intelligence .
my aide , mr armstrong .
colonel , your men in shape for a parachute drop?
maybe a little rusty , sir , but eager as hell .
attention !
at ease .
tuthill , sir , operations .
jefferson , logistics .
lantz , communications .
carry on , men .
gottlieb , sir , weather .
mr gottlieb .
i'm clayton canfil , i run the coast watching system .
he owned a plantation before the war .
you're an australian?
that i am , sir .
happy to have you with us .
well , lieutenant , how are you?
very well , thank you , sir .
commander neal owynn , sir .
what is your function?
personal liaison for admiral broderick .
the admiral felt close rapport should be kept with the forward areas .
he wants to give you all his support .
while on my staff , you'll communicate with toulebonne through me .
i repeat , through me .
question?
no , sir .
egan , break out that chart we've been working on .
there'll be a slight delay .
this way , please .
we'll call this operation apple pie .
not because it's going to be easy , but ... ... because we're going to slice this island into three big pieces .
where in this area could you parachute your raiders without getting tangled up in jungle?
right here , this meadow's big enough .
good .
a low level jump could be done .
you'll land , dig in and wait .
the japs'll swarm in .
that's the idea .
they'll have to weaken their defences to get at gregory .
mr canfil , you know these mountains?
yes , i do .
could a battalion cross those peaks at night?
if they didn't have to lug cannons with them .
there's a narrow pass there at about 6, 000 feet .
i'd have to lead them through .
you got yourself a job .
paul , we'll mount a landing force , circle around and hit this beach .
at the same time , we'll send a third group through the foothills .
three slices , all converging on colonel gregory's position .
when we make contact , we'll drive full force for the jap airstrip and cut the supply line from voyon bay .
after that , we mop up jap positions and gavabutu is secured .
mr gottlieb?
weather .
shaky .
the rains are about to start .
when?
a week , maybe .
then gregory'll jump on sunday .
calculate your timetable accordingly .
aye , aye , sir .
all right , sir .
i want all facts and figures by 0700 tomorrow .
right , sir .
right .
one thing ...
admiral broderick only allowed us 10 planes ...
just a minute .
cdr .
owynn , lt. torrey ...
that's all .
ok , greg .
i can only put 60 % of my men in the air unless we get five more transports .
aren't there any more r4ds in toulebonne?
they're kept in reserve .
for what?
it's how admiral broderick organised it .
what if an r4d conks out?
toulebonne sends a spare till it's fixed .
five of them just conked out .
let's relay the news to broderick .
mr canfil , you've fallen in with thieves .
i think so , too , i'm happy to say .
thanks for getting me out of purgatory .
forget it .
now ...
where's the hospital?
i'll take you to her .
miss dorne .
capt. eddington !
where can we find miss haynes?
she's in there .
thank you , miss dorne .
nurse !
get out of my light .
take him to hut 3 .
in the morning i might've looked better .
you look fine , maggie , just fine .
how do admirals feel about nurses?
the same way captains did .
will there be time for us , out here?
we'll make time .
canfil's battalion is starting down the far side of the mountain .
tell the amphibious group they can start moving in for landing .
colonel ...
you got room in your plane for me?
sure , sir , if you wanna take the risk .
sir .
commander .
no admiral torrey?
he's with the paramarines .
that's very colourful .
gentlemen , there's a story for your papers .
let's go to hq and see if our operation is doing what we intended .
stand up .
hook up .
check your equipment .
stand in the door .
good luck , colonel .
thank you , sir !
let's go , men !
contact our fighter protection .
i want two planes to cover us .
the rest can go home .
may i ask what you're planning?
let's say a sightseeing trip .
you got a pencil?
thank you .
now , we have named this operation apple pie .
it's intended to cut the island into three slices , across the mountains , from the beachhead and through the foothills , converging on a position we have secured with our paramarines .
admiral , have these correspondents been instructed in security?
they'll be instructed , captain .
you may return to your duties .
aye , aye , sir .
i'm sure you boys realise that you're not to file any stories until cdr .
owynn gives you the word .
now , back to operation apple pie .
carry on .
lieutenant , do you have any idea how broderick knows these details?
i'm afraid not , sir .
you wouldn't know about owynn sending special dispatches to toulebonne?
i wouldn't , sir .
bums like your friend owynn are with us always , like bad weather .
but sailors like your old man only happen once in a while .
i'm afraid i cannot accept your evaluation of cdr .
owynn .
i cannot accept you as rock torrey's son .
i think somebody got in ahead of him .
now , wait a minute , eddington !
captain eddington .
yes?
it's all right , captain .
on your feet .
lieutenant !
you can head for the barn .
ok , sir !
change of orders from the old man himself , by god .
we'll romp this circus straight on .
last man to voyon bay's a bloody 'roo !
sorry , chums , kangaroo to you .
baker d , don't move in on road z 2 , it's landmined .
it's moving so fast we can't keep up .
the admiral wants you to meet our war correspondents .
i can't tell 'em anything .
where's the admiral?
he's with them .
say i'll join him as soon as i can .
roger , baker d. keep pushing .
out .
we've had some luck .
canfil should join gregory soon .
joined already .
cutting across to meet the amphibs .
let me see those dispatches .
attention !
carry on , gentlemen .
we were getting anxious about you .
very courageous , going out on the firing line .
but risky leaving command centre at zero hour .
i think it served its purpose .
i'm sure it did .
shall we give the boys a rundown?
might be better in private , sir .
the press is not against us .
give them a break .
if you insist .
fire away , boys .
admiral torrey , is the operation going according to schedule?
not exactly .
we can be more specific than that .
after all , an offensive doesn't travel like an express train .
fact is , it's going to be a long , hard job kicking the enemy off gavabutu .
no reason why we shouldn't admit it .
we can project schedules , but they're hard to keep .
right , admiral?
right , sir .
except we're not behind schedule , we're ahead of it .
our troops should be taking the jap airstrip and our amphibs closing on voyon bay .
but the enemy opposition ...
there is none .
the japs moved out last night .
the island's ours?
yes .
when did you learn this?
why did they pull out?
i think that about covers it for now .
that it does .
wait , we want to know something about this ...
admiral , would you check these dispatches and advise me on how we should mop this up?
yes , certainly .
use the staff room to write your stories .
i will see to it that your stories get out , if cdr .
owynn doesn't mind .
that old man of yours crossed us .
yes , didn't he !
gentlemen ...
we must have a conference with the admiral before he goes tomorrow .
the admiral's leaving?
he feels everything is shipshape .
gottlieb , tuthill .
heads .
goodbye , commander .
enjoy it .
what did he mean by that?
aren't you going with broderick?
no .
i think you are .
now , wait a ...
you'd better be on that plane unless you want to die on gavabutu .
you can't do this ...
i am doing it .
we've got a job here and no one is going to screw it up .
understand?
and take this punk with you .
i'll have him court martialled .
you saw it , i didn't hit him back .
i didn't see anything .
what do you mean you didn't see?
as far as i'm concerned , a coconut hit you on the mouth .
you'd better figure out an excuse to get us on that plane .
want a transfer back to pt boats?
one word from me to broderick and you're on your way .
say the word .
well , here we are , gentlemen .
the marines are soaking their feet in voyon bay .
the airstrip?
planes are landing on it .
this operation's picked clean .
we're already picking another one .
this one's tougher .
you're just in time to help .
right here .
levu vana .
we need details of the jap build up .
air photos don't show much .
we thought your coastwatchers could give us a hand .
why not have a submarine take me there?
i know that island .
just give me a week to creep up on them and i'll blueprint the jap positions .
we wouldn't want to lose you .
i don't plan to get lost .
watch for my signal nightly between midnight and 3 a . m .
ok .
good luck .
special reason for delivering mail?
sort of .
ok .
don't let it keep you too long .
thanks .
hello , marine .
been having any difficulty breathing?
no .
hi .
hello .
jere !
we heard you'd been transferred back to the boats .
congratulations or commiserations?
congratulations .
looking for the mail room?
in a roundabout way .
i'll show you where it is .
thank you .
nice to see you again , ma'am .
same to you .
come on , get over here .
sir , there's no telling when we might ship together again , and me and the boys took a vote .
we voted you best officer to be marooned on a desert island with .
thanks , boats .
we mean it , sir , all kiddin 'aside .
goodbye , culpepper ...
goodbye , al .
mac !
mac !
they didn't tell me you were hurt .
it wasn't worth it .
how'd you get here?
they flew me from pearl .
i've been waiting 10 days for that slow boat of yours to come in !
god , you feel good to me .
i never gave you up , mac , not for one minute .
here .
a present for you from bureau of personnel .
lieutenant commander mcconnel .
that's wonderful !
wait , have you already been given an assignment ...?
flag secretary , third area .
back in that gavabutu hellhole .
with rock torrey , not broderick .
torrey asked for me , bev .
not right away !
that wouldn't be fair .
not right away .
we've got 30 days survivors 'leave .
any ideas what to do with them?
plenty of ideas !
i thought you wouldn't see eddington now you're back with jere .
it's a picnic , there's a bunch going .
but you'll be with eddington?
probably .
you're not wearing jere's ring .
it's too big .
i might lose it .
i see .
i'll tell eddington i'm engaged to jere .
ok .
maggie , i just wanna have a little fun .
don't play games with eddington .
why don't you like him?
he's torrey's best friend .
instinct .
he's got something bottled up behind that dashing charm .
what?
i don't know .
but remember the smiling young lady from niger .
who?
" the smiling young lady from niger
she rode on the back of a tiger
and after the ride she wound up inside
with her smile on the face of the tiger .
maggie !
i can take care of myself .
annie , are you ready?
just a sec !
who's the chaperone on this junket?
i am .
oh , brother !
i'll bring 'em back alive .
come on , they're at the pier !
bye , maggie .
have a good time .
dorne !
shouldn't we go back?
you'll be in trouble with your chaperone .
with sabrina?
that's funny .
you're not afraid , huh?
out here all alone with me .
scared to death .
the water looks delicious .
the tide's out .
i'd love to go in for a dip .
go ahead .
what would you think of me?
i'm an officer and a gentleman .
i wouldn't think .
would you turn your back until i get in?
this is tokyo rose .
we dedicate the next record to all those poor marines on gavabutu .
you're going to be sacrificed because admiral torrey doesn't have enough ships or planes to protect you .
but torrey doesn't care whether you live ...
why can't they jam that?
they don't want to .
the boys like the music .
she doesn't scare anybody .
though she's pretty close to being right sometimes .
like now?
i said pretty close .
we're ok with what we have .
this is a backdoor operation .
the front's with general macarthur .
that's where the jap navy is occupied , not with us .
at least , that's the theory we have to go on .
no sugar !
i'm sorry .
have you seen jere?
no .
i thought maybe you had .
his boat's been running the mail .
he and annalee are on again .
he asked her to marry him after the war .
a cunliffe marry a commoner?
his name isn't cunliffe .
it's torrey .
yeah .
it is , rock .
what are you getting at?
nothing .
he's changed .
he isn't just a smart college kid any longer .
something's happened to him out here .
well ...
i can't start acting like a father now .
i threw that chance away 18 years ago when i gave jere up to his mother .
i wouldn't know how to talk to him or ...
paul !
will you bring my clothes down?
put them down and turn your back .
not this time , baby .
paul , please !
no , you'll have to come and get 'em .
ok , but you're gonna be surprised .
see?
i might as well be in a mother hubbard .
you're beautiful .
my clothes , please .
paul , i'm not gonna let you kiss me .
i'm engaged .
there's this boy ...
give me my clothes , please .
let me go !
let me go !
no !
let me go !
let me go , paul !
take her away .
aye , aye , sir .
take in your lines .
get underway .
quarterdeck to signal bridge .
admiral's party approaching .
good old swayback .
she looks like a real lady .
she is a real lady .
it's a nice sentimental gesture , cincpac sending your old cruiser .
a battleship might be more comforting .
i'm glad to see her .
you don't understand the love affairs between ships and sailors .
what happened to your face?
bucking for a purple heart?
just a friendly wound .
on deck .
intention to board .
bosun's mate , man the side .
congratulations on your command .
welcome home .
they did a good job .
she's in fine shape .
hello .
good to see you .
congratulations .
tuthill , my operations officer .
shall we adjourn to the ward room?
attention , gentlemen !
at ease .
sit down , gentlemen .
we'll dispense with all formalities .
this is my flagship in the operation .
thank you , sir .
now , i'll turn you over to captain eddington .
he'll lay out the plan of operation for you .
this is what it boils down to .
the japs have levu vana .
we want it .
they know it .
we're going to take it , and they'll do their worst to keep us from taking it .
we can't expect any outside help .
we're it .
mr canfil .
excuse us , gentlemen .
i hope you don't mind my interrupting .
sit down , we were worried about you .
i had trouble getting back to the sub .
nips are as thick as treacle pudding on that island .
here it is , admiral .
you're not going to like it .
they're preparing quite a welcome on levu vana .
they're stringing barbed wire on the beaches and pouring concrete for pillboxes .
the airstrip's almost done .
they're building revetments for 200 planes .
tanks bivouacked here and troops .
they're bringing in hundreds every night .
about 5, 000 landed while i was there .
5, 000?
at that rate , we only have three weeks .
that might not be the worst of it .
i was scrounging around a nip camp and listened in on a sake party .
from what i could catch from their gibberish , there's a gathering of ships at their cape titan base .
that could mean a task force .
it could .
you could get a look at titan .
recon planes wouldn't make it back .
could halsey's carriers do a reconnaissance job for us?
not soon .
they're hitting the solomons for general macarthur .
best send a sub for some offshore observation .
that's no good .
it'd take a sub 10 days to get there .
if they're laying in a fleet , we've got to know now .
they could be planning to hit us here before we kick off .
can't you get long range recon planes?
captain , we're on poverty row .
everything's going to macarthur .
we get leftovers , not long range recon planes .
we've got to get one , somehow .
we can try .
get a message off to pearl .
make it strong .
imperative we get at least one long range plane , and get it now .
wet it with tears , bleed on it , egan .
darling , is that you?
hi , honey .
hey , where have you been?
mmm !
you feel good !
i said , " where have you been?
i dropped over to treasure island .
for what?
just to visit with the navy .
i bet that was fun .
hey !
this looks nice .
like?
put it on , i'll take a shower and we'll go out .
mac , is anything wrong?
no , why?
you've got that kind of brainwashed look .
you've got bad news , mac .
tell me now .
if you tell me over dinner , i'll cry in my soup .
yes , i have orders .
when?
they say proceed immediately .
why?
we haven't even used up half of your leave yet .
they don't tell you why .
something's going to happen on gavabutu soon .
oh , hell !
i'm gonna cry anyway !
better?
i might not get you back this time .
oh , honey ...
mac ...
leave me with a baby this time .
please , mac !
'night , maggie .
goodnight , girls .
see you tomorrow .
pat , get a doctor .
quick !
what is it?
a doctor .
hurry !
annalee ...
cincpac sends regrets .
they can't spare one long range plane .
do we commence skyhook anyway?
we've got to know what the japs are doing on titan .
why not send a one way plane to radio the information back?
and the pilot?
he can ditch , a sub can pick him up ...
torrey , here ...
maggie !
what?
i'll be right over .
egan , get me a jeep with a driver .
what's wrong , rock?
a little nurse , friend of maggie's ... ... she's committed suicide .
what?
she was engaged to my son .
when's that staff conference?
0700 .
we'll decide what to do then .
he raped her , rock .
when she was afraid she might be pregnant , she went to him and ...
he didn't believe her .
here , read this .
you said she left jere's ring with the envelope .
shall i tell jere about ...?
no , i'll take him the ring .
i won't see you again for a while .
it's ...
it's starting?
very soon .
captain eddington .
trot me out a pbj .
sir?
now .
yes , sir .
dig me out a flying suit .
aye , aye , sir .
thanks .
what are you looking at?
get back to your radio set .
thanks .
carry on .
sir , how shall i log this flight?
joyride for the chief of staff .
the ejector mechanism is jammed .
attention on deck .
carry on .
morning , sir .
morning .
this is our skipper , lt. mason .
how do you do?
mind if i borrow my son a moment?
of course not , sir .
i want you to get a hold of yourself .
that young nurse , ensign dorne ...
yes?
she's dead .
overdose of sleeping pills .
but why?
why?
whatever the reason , she was thinking of you .
she left this ring for you .
i'm very sorry about that girl , jere .
thank you for coming all the way here .
it's the least i can do for ... one of my officers .
you know , this may not be the right time , but ... ... somehow , it seems that between ...
there ought to be some ...
i know what you mean , sir .
i wouldn't know how to say it myself , but i know what you mean .
goodbye , jere .
goodbye .
the isallobaric gradient is changing rapidly .
the pressure is described by this isobaric curve , which is forcing this low trough off to the east .
for the benefit of an ignorant planter , what does that mean?
our crummy weather's blowing out .
we're due for five days of sunshine .
good oh !
where's eddington?
he hasn't come in yet .
find him .
something wrong?
just find him .
right away .
hello , mac .
when did you get in?
about an hour ago .
welcome .
glad to see you .
thank you .
where are we?
rover , this is john paul .
do you read me?
come in , rover .
rover , this is john paul .
acknowledge , over .
you gave him a plane without checking with operations?
sir , capt. eddington is chief of staff .
he is operations .
are you in contact?
been trying to raise him for hours .
it's for you , admiral .
torrey speaking .
i'll be right over .
mac .
rover , this is john paul .
are you on this frequency?
rover , this is john paul .
come in .
ok , john paul .
this is rover .
do you read me?
over .
i'm answering you , john paul .
do you read me?
rover , this is john paul .
keep sending , i'm trying to pick you up .
acknowledge , over .
we've got him but he must be far away .
transmission's weak .
rover , this is john paul .
how do you hear me?
what's your last bearing?
3 3 0 , sir .
plot that , will you , mac?
this is john paul .
we've lost you .
keep sending , over .
john paul , this is rover .
do you have me now?
repeat .
do you have me now?
i can't keep him .
he's getting farther away .
he must be just south west of cape titan .
rover , change to secondary frequency and i'll try to pick you up .
rover to john paul .
have you got me now?
acknowledge .
roger , we're reading you , over .
i'm flying at 10, 000 feet .
coming up to cape titan from the south west .
do you read me?
rover , this is john paul .
we've got you , clear .
i can't see anything except a couple of sampans and some gooney birds .
we'll be over cape titan in 40 minutes and ...
hold it , john paul , hold it !
i've got something down here .
i'm dropping down to take a closer look .
stay with me .
john paul , this is rover .
it's a fleet , do you hear me?
warships moving to the south , away from cape titan .
i count 16 , no , 17 ships , do you hear me?
i repeat , 17 ships .
confirm , over .
this is john paul .
roger , 17 ships .
over .
i seem to have some company .
zeros from titan , i guess .
i'm going down to take a closer look at these ships .
stay with me .
looks like a screen of 12 destroyers .
repeat , 12 destroyers .
four cruisers ...
can't tell if they're light or heavy .
the zeros want to play now .
here .
hello , rover , this is john paul .
get back into those clouds and stay there .
that pbj is no match for zeros .
stay under cover .
thanks , rock .
but we've got to take a closer look at this big boy .
this is the biggest boy i've ever seen .
it looks like a floating island .
it's four city blocks long and it's got ... 12 big guns .
they look like 18 inchers .
what was that oversized tub the japs built a while ago?
the yamato?
this could be it !
the yamato , 80, 000 tonnes .
do you hear me?
over .
we read you , rover .
if this baby comes your way , look out !
excuse me , john paul , i'm gonna be a trifle busy .
rover !
come in , rover .
paul !
the yamato , four cruisers and 12 tin cans .
a lot of firepower .
we can't be sure it's aimed at us .
they could be escorting the yamato to another base , truk or pelaki shima .
they could be , but they're not .
that task force is aimed for levu vana .
that's right , egan .
it ties up with their maximum effort to defend that island .
finish the airfield , put bombers on it and they'll control the whole area .
gavabutu will become untenable , eventually we'll have to move out of toulebonne .
skyhook in reverse .
that task force is headed this way .
mac , gottlieb gave us five days of good weather?
yes , sir .
what do you estimate the steaming time from titan to levu vana?
they can't go very fast .
they have to go through the straits .
better part of four days .
with a little push , we can launch our amphib assault in 48 hours .
if we're covering the landing , who takes care of the jap fleet?
our ships'll have to do double duty .
establish the beachhead , then put back to sea and meet the new threat .
you think we have a chance to stop it?
we can try .
tuthill , you're chief of staff .
sir , how shall i list captain eddington's flight?
i have to account for the plane .
an authorised mission .
will you make a recommendation for capt. eddington?
what he did deserves a medal of honour .
maybe , but paul wasn't hunting medals .
no , no recommendation .
anything new on the jap fleet?
nothing , a blank .
maybe they're not headed this way .
let's keep reconnaissance busy .
they're not going round the islands .
they're headed for pala passage .
they'll run it at night .
is that possible with a fleet of that size?
the japanese navy has a bad habit of doing the impossible .
how wide is the narrowest part?
20 miles .
10 miles show a deep channel .
i want those 10 miles mined .
mines won't stop the yamato .
she's armour plated .
we might nail some of the escort vessels .
and tut , send the pt boats with the mine layer .
they're manoeuvrable in the shoals .
they can attack while the japs are tangled in the mines .
rock ...
in the morning ...
what's it like ...?
... a surface battle?
like any other battle , i guess .
maybe a little noisier .
i'm so scared my bones are clicking ,
like dice on a reno crap table .
i should be back in hollywood , sitting in front of a typewriter , making all this up for a movie .
not living it .
all battles are fought by scared men who'd rather be someplace else .
does that include admirals?
yes .
admiral , another 30 minutes and they tangle with the minefield .
jere .
loosen up !
skipper , if i let you down , will you please shoot me?
sure !
doin 'real good out there on the minefield .
here we go !
skipper !
take over the helm !
go on !
stand by to torpedo !
roll one !
roll two !
we got 'em !
we got 'em again !
plot ...
roger , give it to me .
first reports , admiral .
two destroyers hit by mines ...
one destroyer torpedoed by boats .
what?
repeat .
one cruiser dead in the water !
that's cutting 'em down to size !
casualty report?
anything on casualties?
not yet , sir .
casualty report on the pt boats , rock .
signal all destroyers ,
" lay smokescreen and attack .
this is plot ...
go , babies , go !
stand by to commence firing .
all guns .
three rounds rapid fire salvo ...
now !
fire !
the yamato came through .
signal all ships to make flank speed .
steer evasive course as planned .
you're wanted in plot .
she's getting outta range !
signal a 50 degree turn to starboard .
50 degree turn to port .
all guns to fire at the turn .
bridge !
bridge !
bridge ...
the captain's dead .
they're all dead .
what do i do , sir?
stand by .
i'm taking over the bridge .
mac !
i'm with you , sir !
sir ... !
get up , sir ... !
the ship is breaking up !
abandon ship !
abandon ship !
nurse ...
nurse ...
maggie , he spoke !
he said " nurse " !
rock?
can you hear me?
maggie .
where ...?
a hospital ship bound for pearl harbor .
we arrive there in the morning .
what happened?
better let me do the talking .
you've been asleep almost three weeks .
you were badly wounded .
shell fragments .
but you're going to be all right .
what's that tent for?
that's the worst of it , rock .
you've lost your left leg .
egan?
egan was killed .
tuthill?
all of them .
except mac mcconnel .
he saved your life .
got you on a life raft before the ship went down .
he's here .
you can see him tomorrow .
i've got to know ...
tomorrow .
tomorrow .
your hands .
burns , sir , but they'll be ok .
thanks for looking after me , mac .
some of the crew looked after both of us until a tin can picked us up .
gregory ... beachhead ... wiped out?
no , sir .
they had the japs boxed up at the north of the island .
the yamato turned and fled back up the passage .
why?
we were licked , weren't we?
good morning , sir .
stand easy .
you're a hard man to kill , admiral .
seems so , sir .
i managed to get my command shot to hell with no trouble .
feel you betrayed them by staying alive?
something like that .
seven ships sacrificed .
it'll make a fancy court martial .
he's still doped up?
a little , sir .
let me straighten you out , admiral .
the battle in pala passage was a decisive victory .
skyhook's on its way and the japs can't stop it .
i'm having you flown to the states , but not for court martial .
they'll stick a peg leg on you and ship you back .
you'll stump to tokyo with the rest of us .
you'll do it from the deck of a ship in command of a task force .
clear?
yes , sir .
then go back to sleep .
aye , aye , sir .
you've got your orders .
go to sleep .
maggie?
i'll be here , rock .
