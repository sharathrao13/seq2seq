now , go easy now .
the injects take a while to wear off .
sorry about the restrains .
you have got one hell the right hook .
where am l?
arcatic psychiatric hospital .
i find that i don't like it .
for making a mistake .
my work is not a military application .
which work is that , john?
i don't know anything .
it's no good in keeping secrets , you know .
charles?
charles?
i don't mean to get you involve in this .
i'm sorry ...
charles?
the portugal roommate reveal .
you saw my name on the lectures league?
you lie , you son of the bitch !
who are you talking to?
tell me who you see .
i did see charles running with the russians .
you people !
no one , actually .
there is no one there .
he was there ...
stop !
i don't know anything .
stop !
i don't know anything !
my name is john nash !
i have been held against my will !
somebody tell the department of defense !
my name is john nash !
i have been held against my will ! ...
what's wrong with him?
people with this disorder are often paranoid .
but his work ...
he deals with conspiracies , so ...
yes ...
yes , i know .
and john's behaviours are accepted ...
encouraged .
as such , his nerve may have gone unfree in far any longer than it's typical .
what do you mean?
how long?
possibly since graduates schools .
at least that is since his halucinations begun .
what are you talking about?
what the halucinations are?
one ... so far that i aware .
he imagined he has a roommate named charles hermen .
charles isn't an imaginary .
he and john are best friends since princeton .
have you ever met charles?
did he ever come to dinner?
he was always in town for several times , lecturing .
was he on your wedding?
he ...
have you seen a picture of him or talk to him through a telephone?
this is ridiculous .
i phoned princeton .
according to a housing record , john lived alone .
which is more likely , that your husband ... a mathematician with no military training .
he is a government spy , flaying the russians ...
you are making him sounds crazy .
or ... he has his grip of reality .
now the only way i can help him , is to show him the difference .
which is he was real and what is in his mind .
come on .
what has he been working on?
his work is classified .
he mentioned a supervisor .
a name of william patcher .
maybe this patcher can clarify things for us .
but i can't get to him without clearances .
you want me to get the details of my husband's work?
john thinks i am a russians spy .
ls that what you think?
what did the doctor said?
i don't know .
i want to see what john has been working on .
alicia , you can't go into his office .
you know it is classified , alicia .
stop !
oh my god ...
oh my god ...
why didn't you say something?
alicia ...
i mean ...
john has been a little weird .
he say he was doing code breaking , yet that was only eyes only .
top secret , part of the military ...
was he?
that's possible .
i mean the director comes down all the time .
some of us are clear for it .
that was possible .
possible , but not likely .
lately he becomes much more agitated .
then when you called ...
so ... is this all these he had been doing everyday?
cutting out magazines?
well ... not all ...
i'm so worry .
i have to talk to you .
okay .
alicia , i have been thinking about ...
i let you realize the inability to discuss the situation with you .
i don't have other choice .
i do understand .
i'm ... really sorry .
that's okay .
everything is going to be alright .
everything is going to be alright .
just have to talk quietly .
they maybe listening .
there maybe microphones .
when i am telling you everything now , it's breaking the protocol .
but you need to know .
because you have to help me to get out off here .
alicia , i have been doing top secret work for the government .
there is the threaten exist .
we cannot stop them for portions .
lnteractions .
my profile is too high .
so i just simply don't do it with me .
they are keeping me here , because i tried to stop from doing my work .
you have to go to wheeler .
you have find william patcher ...
stop ...
stop !
you help me ...
stop !
i went to wheeler .
good ...
good ...
there is no patcher .
of course there are , i have been working for ...
doing what?
breaking codes?
dropping the packages at the secret mailbox for the government to pick up?
how do you know that?
sow followed you .
they haven't been opened .
it isn't real .
there is no conspirancy , john .
there is no william patcher .
it's in your mind .
you understand , baby?
you're sick .
you're sick , john .
john !
john !
code red .
dr rosen , code red .
observation room 2 .
john?
john?
the implant's gone .
i can't find it .
it's gone .
he has the nightmare because his friend there .
he's not knowing what's true .
lmagine that he would suddenly learn that the people , the places and the moments .
most important to him are all gone .
not there .
but worse , they've never been .
one kind of hell would that be .
administering insulin .
how often?
five times a week .
john always spoke so fondly being here in princeton .
and hensen is running the department now .
so he keep reminding us , reminding us .
yeah .
john won't come here to the campus though .
it is a shame .
alicia , how ... how are you holding up?
division has passed .
they are saying with medication and those dressing in ...
no ...
i mean ...
i mean how are you?
i think often when i feel ...
it's obligation .
a guilt ... over warning to leave .
rich , i guess .
john ... against god ...
but then i look at him .
and i force to see myself the man that i married .
and he becomes that man that he has transform into someone that i love .
and i transform to someone who loves him .
it's not all of the time , but ... it's enough .
i think john is a very lucky man , alicia .
someone lucky ...
this is ours .
this is it?
it's nice .
it's here where i work .
john , you have a visitor .
hi .
hi .
i hope it's okay .
hey , chief .
cigarette?
no , thanks .
i've quit , actually .
hello .
hey , john .
have you met harvey?
john , i ...
actually it's okay .
you can have a little fun .
jesus christ , john .
i should have know .
here you go .
i can take those later .
you are suppose to take them now .
can i bring you something?
i'm okay .
it's okay .
so ...
i was in town giving a workshop .
i'll go back tonight .
you know bender ...
he really wanted to stop by ... and something like seeing you ...
you know , say hi .
i suppose that would be too .
but at last , i'm stop with me .
i'm trying to hold the remark on hypothesis .
i figure if i have dazzled it , they would have to reinstead me .
first , it's difficult with the medication ... because it is hard to see the solution .
you know , john .
you should go easy .
there are other things besides ... besides work .
what are they?
what are you thinking about?
what do people do?
slave , john .
activities are normal .
just have meaning .
you could try live in a house .
you know , maybe try talk to people .
you can try taking out the garbage .
who ... who're talking to?
garbage man .
garbage man don't come at night .
i guess here around , they do .
sorry .
ls that the medication?
my mother is going to keep the baby a little longer tonight .
i'll get three hour overtime .
i'm going to bed .
good night .
good night .
good to see you , john .
it has been a while .
patcher?
yes , sir .
you're not real .
of course i am .
don't be ridiculous .
and don't think that i will go that way , john .
it's time for you to get back to work .
the bomb is in it's final position .
here in u. s.
knowing your position , you'll keep a low profile .
we have brought it to the mountain , to you .
we have known the bomb's location somewhere in the eastern seabroad .
but we haven't able to pin point it's exact position .
their codes have grow to increasing complex .
look at this , john .
what?
what?
dr rosen said ...
let's get to the definite reality .
psychological bullshit !
look at me , john .
john , look at me .
do i look like an imagine?
wheeler has no record of you .
do you think we list our personal?
john , i'm sorry that you have to go through all these .
i've gone to a great deal of trouble to get you back .
i can restore your status in wheeler .
i can let the world know what you did .
but i need you now , soldier .
i am so scared that you are not real .
listen , i'm not coming .
i am just going to grab the laundry , okay?
i'll do his bath .
it's okay .
okay .
john?
this is going to wet the baby's .
oh god ...
charles was here .
he said it was okay .
there's no one here .
charles was watching ...
there's no one here .
he has been injecting with the insulin ...
i can see him because it was release in my blood stream ...
and my imply resolve .
i can't tell you because it is all under protection .
alicia ...
no ...
hello , i need dr rosen's office please .
you got to stop her , john .
you leave her out of this .
who are you talking to?
it's not her fault .
john .
it's your comprimises again ...
don't you won't .
you'll go back to the hospital .
john , answer me !
can't please people , or you will die .
alicia , please put the phone down .
i can't let that happen .
yes , hello .
yeah , i need dr rosen .
ls he in?
i'm sorry i have to do that .
no ! ...
alicia , you know i have to do that .
go away from me ...
she is too greater risk .
go away .
i don't mean to hurt you .
finish her .
she knows too much now .
uncle john .
you take care your pathetic piece of shit or i'll take care off you .
john .
john , please .
do what he says .
move , soldier .
now .
uncle john .
john , please .
now !
charles is watching her .
with alicia .
i understand .
she never gets old .
marcee can't be real .
she never gets old .
you see them now?
yes .
why did you stop your medicine?
because i couldn't do my work .
i couldn't help with the baby .
i couldn't ...
i couldn't respond to my wife .
i think that's getting better than being crazy .
we'll need to start you on a higher run of insulin shoots and your medication ...
no .
it has to be another way .
gets to it is generative .
someday it's maybe symptom free .
but overtime , you're getting worse .
it's a problem .
so it is .
it's a problem with no solution .
and that's what i do .
i solve problems .
it isn't math .
you can't come up with a formula that you can change the way you experience the world .
all i have to do is plan my mind .
no theory , no proof .
there isn't a way out of this .
why cannot?
because your mind is the problem in the first place .
i can do this .
i can work it out .
all i need is time .
ls that the baby?
baby is still at my mother's , john .
without treatment , john .
pathetics may take over .
entirely .
you are almost ready .
rosen is waiting outside .
i can't go back to that hospital .
i won't come home .
he has commitment papers for me to sign .
or maybe you won't sign .
maybe you just give us sometime .
i will try to figure this out .
what ever you do .
rosen is right about one thing .
you shouldn't be here .
i am not safe anymore .
would you have hurt me , john?
i don't know .
maybe i should let dr rosen try to determine .
rosen said you wasn't tried to kill me or anything .
you will know what's real .
this ...
this ...
this is real .
make me the partner to awake from the dream .
maybe isn't you .
maybe it's here .
i need to believe that something extraordinary is possible .
come .
hello , martin .
jesus christ .
i don't have that one , my savor complex text on the completely different form .
i heard what had happened .
i wanted to write .
i tried to call you since you left ...
this is helinger's old office .
yeah ...
i stole it from him .
it seems that you won after all , martin .
they were wrong , john .
no one wins .
please .
have a seat .
it's so good to see you .
what brings you back to priceton?
john ...
john , i'm sorry .
but you have to tell him .
tell him you are a genius , john .
tell him your work is critical , please .
ls there any chance that you could ignore what i just did?
of course , what's old friends for?
ls that what we are , martin?
friends?
john , of course .
of course , we always have been .
alicia and i think that ...
i have to fit in to a part of the community .
that might be some good .
there are several attachments .
familiar places , familiar people .
might help me elbow out ... from this ... from this certain delusions that i have .
it is a lot to ask .
so i am here .
quite some of the people just say no .
but i was wondering if i could hang around .
will you be needing an office?
no ...
no ... lcould just work out in the library .
this guy is trying to loiter in the library .
but he doesn't have an ld .
why can't people read their memos , huh?
then he goes totally nuts .
shit ...
shit ...
you are not real ...
ls that what you are , soldier?
some useless cold .
the local banned man?
i am not a soldier .
you can handle by yourself .
all .
old , worthless , disguided .
there's no mission .
the world that you are walking through , the world will burn ash .
you are not real .
you're still talking to me , soldier .
there's no mission .
i am not a soldier .
john ...
hey , it's okay .
i just heard what happen .
i'm sorry , john .
i'm not a soldier .
john ...
hey , nash .
you are alright .
hey , nash .
ladies and gentlemen , great john nash !
john !
you should have seen those faces .
everybody's staring at me .
john ...
you know that stress treats you the delusions .
i know .
but i don't know the way how ...
charles was there .
sometimes i really miss talking to him .
maybe rosen's right .
maybe i should think about going back to the hospital again .
come here .
maybe try again tomorrow .
john , you can't let go me forever .
charles , you are a very good friend to me .
the best .
but i won't talk to you again .
i just can't .
the same goes to you , baby .
goodbye .
goodbye .
how is it matter if i'm on your course?
it's ... it's an honour , professor nash .
ls something wrong?
this would be my first class .
good morning , young lifes .
it's just not going to work , john .
you're just humiliating yourself .
it's pathetic .
you're being pathetic .
i'm ashamed of you .
are you coming?
you're going to be late .
dad , you got my book .
what?
you got my book .
thanks .
goodbye .
see you tonight .
bye , honey .
do you just solve rima?
what do you think?
that's an analogue for non communitive extensions .
yes , it is .
it's just a piece of work , not so prodically , so ...
but ...
i believe i'm making progress .
you're ... you're john nash , right?
toby collard .
hello .
i'm studying your record .
the one you wrote here at princeton .
to come up with something totally original the way you did .
you know , i was young .
i have been developing a theory .
i believe i can prove the extentions in covering space .
that everything ... everything is connected .
that is all part of the same subject .
when was the last time you ate?
excuse me .
you know , food .
my wife , she loves mayonnaise .
thank you .
go on .
the factor is in two categories .
alicia .
i was thinking i am not a teacher .
classroom with 50 students could be don thing for anyone .
john , besides you are a terrible teacher .
i am a quiet taste , martin .
i was just hoping that there is something that i can contribute .
what about the ...
you know , are they gone?
no , they are not gone .
maybe they never will be .
but i got used to ignore .
i think they are kind of giving up on me .
you think that is what's like .
all our dreams and nightmares , martin?
we got to keep feeding them to let them stay alive?
john , they haunted you ...
they might past .
no body is haunted by their past .
well , goodbye .
john , i'll talk to the department .
maybe in the spring .
hey , nash .
you're ... scared?
terrify , modify , petrify , stupidfy by you .
thanks , professor .
goodbye .
have a nice day .
goodbye .
see you .
professor nash .
can you see him?
ya .
are you sure?
how is he?
good .
forgive me .
i'm just always suspicious in old people .
see you next week , professor .
see you next week .
so now that i know you are real .
who are you and what can i do for you?
professor , my name is thomas king .
and i am here to tell you that you've been considered to the nobel prize .
look at me .
i'm just a little stun .
over the past few years , your equal liberty has become a corner stone of modern economics .
suddenly everybody just about to like that one .
what about my work in some other project?
some mathematic?
the application of your bargaining problem to f. c. c. banned with auctions or to any trust cases ...
trust cases?
yes .
i never would have princip on that .
i just lead some honesty to some stupidity .
no , you haven't .
i would never had thought about that .
shall we have tea?
i don't go in there .
i usually just take my sandwich in the library .
come on , john .
let's have some tea .
it's a big day .
most commercial have my tea in the palette .
there was some northern lndian tea , that i enjoyed the flavour ...
i have not been in this room for quite so many years ...
things are certainly change around here .
i have a son that age .
harvard .
i thought the receivers of the nobel prize is to be secreted .
i thought you won't have find out if you have won or lost .
that is generally the case , but this is circumstances .
the award is just substantial .
they require private funding as such ... the image of the nobel ...
oh i see .
you come here just to find out if i'm crazy .
find out if i'll screw out everything that i actually want .
strip naked like a chicken thing pours around the nature .
something like that , yes .
but i embarass you .
yes , it is possible .
you see ...
i am crazy .
i take medications .
i still see things that is not real .
i just choose not to acknowledge .
i could die after mad .
i choose not to and indulge certain appetites .
like my appetite to patterns .
perhaps my appetite to imagine , to dream .
professor nash .
it's good to have you here , john .
it's an honour , sir .
thank you very much .
a privilege , professor .
professor .
thank you .
thank you there .
that is most certainly unexpected .
thank you .
i've always believe in numbers .
ln equations , and logics that lead to reasons .
but after lifetime of such persuade ,
i asked , what truly is logic .
who decides its reason .
my quests has take them in to the physical , the mental physical , the delusional and back .
and i've made the most important discovery of my career .
the most important discovery of my life .
it is only a mysterious quest of love .
that any logical reasons can be found .
and i am only hitted because of you .
you are the reason i am .
you are all my reasons .
thank you .
i'll call for the car , dad .
are you ready to go now?
oh yes , i am .
yes , indeed .
yes , please .
thank you so much .
thank you .
what is it?
what's wrong?
no .
nothing .
nothing at all .
come with me , young lady .
