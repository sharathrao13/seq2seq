good morning , gentlemen .
my name is captain saunders .
commanding officer , alpha company .
third advance infantry training brigade .
welcome to the infantry , gentlemen .
no matter where you did your basic , either fort polk or elsewhere . . . . . . rest assured that we train the proudest , the toughest . . . . . . the best equipped soldiers .
this base is the largest supplier of combat troops overseas .
so don't let any man here start having any little . . . . . . pasty fucking daydreams about being anyplace else .
i shit you not , gentlemen .
you are headed for a two way firing range .
you will be sent to the war .
you will be here for an eight week training cycle .
after that , you will remain here for a week more .
we will ship you to an outpost 1 0 miles from here . . . . . . that is known throughout the army as the second worst place on earth .
tigerland .
it is the stateside province of vietnam . . . . . . and it is as close to the war as we can make it .
now , gentlemen , it behooves you to learn . . . . . . what little we can teach you here .
for if you do , then maybe . . . . . . just maybe . . . . . . you will return one day to play stink finger with sally back home .
let's get squared away .
those of you not on detail will have a pass for the weekend .
training begins monday at 0430 .
from that time on , every son of a bitch humps his own load .
sucky sucky , baby?
oh , no , thank you .

private bozz is showing the proper way to dig a hole under fire .

under fire you will dig a hole with your teeth if you have to .
open your mouth .

i'm sorry this happened to you .
there ain't gonna be no more clowning from you .
you hear?
go wash up and hit the rack .
shut your cake hole , miter .
you're giving cantwell a headache .
i'm telling you , and that's like getting an order from the sergeant .
don't make me put you on report .
give it a rest .
it's been a hard day for all of us .
don't you give me a hard time , paxton .
you're okay .
you'll be a good soldier , but this individual
he wants to be a bumblefuck .
he wants to laugh at everything we do .
he'll hurt this platoon .
what are you , 20 years old?
just because you wear sergeant stripes don't mean you ain't gonna die .
where you going that we ain't , bozz?
you best start to soldiering , boy , or you're coming home in a bag .
fuck .
just wanted you to know , i've taken a great dislike to you .
is there anything else , wilson?
no .
i don't reckon there is .
i'm gonna tell you something .
this is the last time you'll hear it .
you can't kill a dink with a ricochet .
oh , this is all about killing people?
well , shit .
so you can shoot when you want to .
when i want to .
idea of killing dinks excite you?
cease fire .
cease fire .
get your targets , scumbags .
all clear .
sgt .
you can't hit your targets , there'll be hell to pay .
shit , i do believe that's cantwell's target there , boys .
not a single bullet hole in it .
shut your face , wilson .
sgt. thomas'll chew my ass for chow .
you ain't gonna be making any phone calls home .
you gonna be busy .
all asses and elbows , picking up ciggie butts .
you're a one man campaign to make the world uglier .
i ain't afraid of you , bozz .
yes , you are , wilson .
you're just too stupid to realize it .
okay then , sunday school .
you're such a goddamn saint , give cantwell your target .
i'll give him yours .

wilson switched targets with cantwell .
that's true .
that's bullshit .
lie down .
permission to  now , shitbird !
yes , sergeant .
you know why this man's on the ground?
because he's dead !
he's dead .
and you can't bury him .
do you know why?
why , sarge?
sgt .
because you're dead too !
you're all dead . . . . . . because you don't know how to fire weapons on semiautomatic .
or how to hit charlie with short bursts . . . . . . so your goddamn barrels don't overheat .
and because this shitbag can't hit his fucking target .
any questions?
no , sergeant .
i got a question .
if i'm dead , how come i can ask you a question?
i know exactly what you're doing , you pissant fairy .
i want you . . .
. . . and your two girlfriends here . . . . . . to report to the mess sergeant after chow tonight .
get up , lazarus .
you're resurrected .
get up .
cantwell .
you're getting a lot less funny , bozz .
there's some big old moon shining down .
reminds you what this world is all about .
what , peeling potatoes?
it's good you talk so slow , cantwell .
paxton there is taking notes .
maybe he'll put you in a book .

i don't rightly know what you're talking about .
i don't read much .
never got past sixth grade .

i was 1 5 .
we had two together .
she had two previous .
i'm 1 9 , but she's a might older .
she's 28 .
i got a little boy who's 1 and a little girl who's 2 .
what the fuck are you doing here , man?
don't it strike you how it's the same moon shining?
and it's shining down on us here . . . . . . and shining down on that little girl who's my wife .
it's the same moon . . . . . . that'll be shining when we go to war .
same moon that's shining down on those boys getting shot .
don't it strike you what it means?
how each of us is a bit of everything .
and everything is shit .
i know that back home . . . . . . preacher be talking about right and wrong .
about the lord and god and jesus .
but you know . . . . . . if the lord or god or jesus . . . . . . be standing here right now . . . . . . he'd say , " cantwell . . .
. . . you forget about all these promises .
you forget about what all anybody say .
and you forget about all them big sunday fancy ideas .

you shouldn't even be in this army .
you're just too stupid to get yourself out .
i told them my predicament .

and you bought that?
the man said it .

nobody , sir .
i know my rights .
no , you don't .
your case won't be reviewed until after you're overseas .
dismissed .
no , sir .
i don't believe that's correct .
and i believe if you don't allow me to see a j. a. g. officer , sir . . . . . . then under the uniform code of military justice . . . . . . i can file a complaint with the inspector general .
and nobody can keep me .
jesus christ !
when did " my country , right or wrong " turn into " fuck this "?

yes , sir .
how far did you get in school?
almost sixth grade , sir .
i guess they study law early where you come from .
sgt .
sir , if i may speak frankly .
you underestimate the harm someone like bozz can do .
he's bad for the army , sir .
capt .
everything's bad for the army these days .
even war .
now drive your knee through his face .
shove his brain through his ear .
good !
thank you , sir .
what's your solution?
shit can him out of the army?
of course not .
that's what he wants .
exactly .
court martial him .
i guarantee he'll snap shit then .
sergeant , you know we won't court martial him .
it'll cost beaucoup dollars . . . . . . and battalion will ask why i can't keep one asshole trainee in line .
five weeks from now , he'll be in the war .
and he'll soldier then , by god .
good or bad .
sure as shit .
maybe not .
got cantwell out .
two other guys from his squad .
every son of a bitch j. a. g. shrink bleeding heart pissed down on us .

i'll stop this damn truck .
both of you can walk back  you bastard . . . . . . you think you so damn smart .
i hear northern boys are the first to go in vietnam .
yeah , but at least we can find it on a map .
real fucking funny , pax .
ain't nobody gonna die .

you know what your problem is , wilson?
you need to listen for the pop .

and bring your shit !
rest of you , sit your asses down .
nobody saves anybody , you stupid son of a bitch .
what the fuck are you doing , man?
it's not doing me any favors .
charlie 6 , this is charlie 2 .
miter has properly demonstrated . . . . . . the use of the ta 31 2 field radio .
except for this , which is not in the manual .
if you ever catch charlie . . . . . . you might want info on where the rest of his buddies is .
only charlie is a close lipped bastard who won't tell you fuck all .
that's why you tie his gook hands , take down his gook pants . . . . . . and grab his gook balls .
here , miter , hold these .
you pinch these clips on each of his slant eyed nuts . . . . . . and you juice up the radio . . .
. . . that'll send enough shock so he'll tell you anything you want .
hell , he'll tell you the minor league baseball scores .
you read me?
yes , sergeant .
he'll tell you how his mother wipes her ass if you give him this juice .
not only that , you'll be able to find him real easy next time .
because he'll light up the fucking night .
no one said you could leave .
why?
why what?
why would i do that to another human being?
brother's right .
what the fuck's wrong with you?
that's one of your men .
get him back here , boy .
bozz !
go get him , boy .
jesus , bozz .
don't do this to me .
get back here , you worthless sack of shit !
bozz !
you can't control your own men , it is your ass .
drop trou .
what?
drop trou !
double time , come on !
skivvies too .
well , what do you know?
you do have a pair of balls after all .
wilson , crank this thing .
yes , sergeant .
we'll now demonstrate the proper way . . . . . . to give information when connected to the ta 31 2 .
see if you can tell me why you can't control your men .
see if you light up tonight .
light him up .
shut the fuck up , hicks .
contact .
never even touched you , son .
that's it .
class dismissed .
go on to your next class .
go on .
go on !
wilson , looks like we're having roasted nuts tonight , huh?
i didn't know you was so goddamn funny .
i can't wait to catch me a vc , spark his balls off .
i'll start with you tonight , miter .
got this , pax?
the crazed , sadistic soldier . . . . . . who flips out and kills people .
i think i saw you look at miter's balls earlier .
funny there , bozz .
funny , yeah .
you're a disgrace to the uniform , fucking piece of shit !
hey !
hey , what the fuck?
break it up , man !
get the fuck up !
civilian bullshit !
what the hell is going on?
miter !
you better do some fast explaining or your men in a world of hurt .
there was an argument . . . . . . and one of the men  slipped on the soap in the shower .
wrestling .
it got out of hand .
it happens when people live together , fuck together .
sorry , soldier , you must've slipped on some soap yourself .
what's wrong with you?
look like you ate some frozen shit for breakfast .
nothing's wrong , sergeant .
it better stay that way , you read me?
all of you .
goddamn it , do you hear me?
yes , sergeant !
you got guard duty .
four listening posts at the edge of the perimeter .
dig yourself a hole and forget about chow .
out here , you're challenged on guard duty .
and you do it by the book .
but in nam , if you hear something in the bushes . . . . . . i mean anything , you open fire .
you fire into those bushes until you kill whatever made that sound .
when the sun comes up , i don't give a fuck . . . . . . whether it's man , woman , child or little johnny next door .
kill it or you're not coming home .
like the my lai massacre , sergeant?
paxton . . . . . . why don't you join your asshole buddy?
missing a meal would be good for your wisecracking ass also .
now let's fall back in for chow !
goddamn it , do it now !
you want to march six miles tonight?
fucking weapons at ease !
feel like i'm digging my own fucking grave here .
when i was a kid . . . . . . i used to think i could dig my way to china .
you watched too many cartoons , jim .
maybe if we dig long and hard enough , we'll tunnel our way out of this dump .
why don't you?
my arm's too tired .
no , really .
why don't you get yourself out of the army?
i'm not that brave .
in that case , i'll just have to bury you myself !
move it out !
come on , move it out !
stay the fuck down !
stay the fuck where you are !
move !
you got to move it !
stay the fuck down !
they're firing in our path !
move it !
sgt .

sgt .
miter !
what's wrong with you?
when your men are told to move out , they move out !
when i give orders , you're supposed to jump .
do you read me?
yes , sergeant !
the m 60s fired directly across our path !
they'd have cut us in two !
who told you to open your fucking mouth?
miter's platoon guide !
you gotta flank that m 60 !
ls that clear?
yes , sir .
if you want these dumb ass bitches dead . . . . . . you wouldn't take them in the belly of a pig . . . . . . with a 762 to split their skull !
you flank the objective !
you read me?
yes , sergeant !
get these fucking men out the hole !
move it out !
stay down !
stay down !
stay down !
what did you say , maggot brained son of a bitch? !
i said , stay down .
get these men out the hole now !
platoon guide , do it !
move it !
come on , goddamn it !
stay down .
are you stupid enough to fuck with me , boy?
tomorrow at base it's you , me and the captain .
if your insubordinate ass ain't in stockade by midday chow . . . . . . i'll kill you myself !
you won't kill me , sergeant .
i don't know what you'll do to me , but you won't kill me .
goddamn you , bozz !
sgt .

sgt .
don't turn your back on me !

i'm not part of it .
nobody quits the army .
i'm not quitting . . . . . . i'm just not playing .

i tell you what .
if you snap shit and soldier like i know you can . . . . . . i'll forget about this .

i ain't a boy , goddamn it !
telling me how he's a big fancy war hero !
and my wife , that little
my wife .

she was mad at me because i was working all the time .

my daddy said it .
he said , " see?
see what a dumb ass bastard you are?
blinded by the beaver store , boy .
you ought to have a little ring in your nose .
so you thought you'd join the army and kill yourself like a real man .
bozz , i know you can get people out .
maybe .
even in this wild ass nonsense , some rules fly by .
please , bozz .
please get me out of here .
please?
well , look here .
goddamn .
that captain sure didn't want to let me go at first .
but i did like you said .
told him the army wants me to see a psychiatrist .
and that was it , huh?
i wanted to thank you personally .
doctor sent me on leave .
he'll contact the red cross , get me out processed . . . . . . so i don't have to come back .

try not to get shot , hear?
don't let your meat loaf , man .
yeah , fuck you .
private bozz , reporting as ordered .
at ease .
so you're the new platoon guide for 2nd platoon?
yes , sir .
the fucking world is full of fucking surprises .
it wasn't your plan to wear sergeant's stripes . . . . . . a week away from tigerland in a war .
i don't know , sir .
the idea crossed my mind now and again .
i just didn't think it would all be so pitiful sad .
been looking over your 201 .
you're a texas boy .
couple run ins with the law .
a year in state college .
dropout , worked construction .
get drafted?
yes , sir .
why didn't you stay in school?
maybe i needed some trouble , sir .
well , you got it .
you also got responsibility .
you got a platoon to run .
the company's like the bad end of a shit storm .
your platoon's the worst .
thank you , sir .
that's not a compliment , smart ass .
i don't want any more calls from battalion . . . . . . asking me why this troopie needs a hardship discharge . . . . . . and that troopie needs some kind of a mental wet nurse .
you understand me?
yes , sir .
wipe that fucking grin off your face .
a week from now you'll ship out to tigerland .
that'll crawl in your skull and look out your eyes .
so let's start fresh .
give your people a weekend pass .
already done it , sir .
you are a goddamn piece of work , bozz .
i believe you could soldier as well as any man in this army .
i even think you want to , but you won't .
i'm just trying to keep myself alive .
we're fighting a war , private .
nobody knows how he's gonna come back .
that's not the kind of alive i'm talking about , sir .
here's 1 50 bucks .
happy halloween !
cough it up , brian .
next time , pax .
catch you later , buddy .
all right .
who's that girl you're talking to , bozz?
trying to score some weed .
know what i don't get?
why they haven't tossed you out on some lunatic discharge . . . . . . some bullshit like that .
i ain't crazy .
you're out of your fucking mind .
my reasons are my reasons and no one has to like them .
what about these fucking war games?
what if it's a lie?
what if the guys who tell you and me shit to do were lied to also?
maybe since everyone believes in the same mistake , you know . . . . . . maybe they're all as confused as we are .
all this " boy's boy , man's man " bullshit .
ever feel you're just being stupid?
yeah .
and it gives me a warm , gooey feeling inside too .
oh , man , we need women , pax !
we need song and prayers to the moon and deep breaths of the night wind .
oh , i hear you , buddy !
i hear your asshole's tighter than a migraine .
fuck you !
hey , man .
you're bozz , right?
uh huh .
fellas say that if you don't want to go to nam . . . . . . you better pray to jesus or talk to roland bozz .
better start praying to jesus , then .
sorry , kid !
oh , my god , look here .
oh , jesus !
i'm in trouble , i'm in trouble !
you are !
come here , baby .
i'll come if you got some money .
i might have some money .
you might or you do?
you better have some .
that's what i need to see .
you want to see it?
yeah , i do .
you got me covered , right?
here it is .
as i was about to come , i let out a fart .
should've seen her face .
heard it in the next room .
thought a grenade went off .
how was yours?
expensive .
you feel guilty?
because i'm broke?
i figured you for a guy who left a sweetheart back home .
she left me .
that's why you joined the army .
go on , confess .
no , she broke it off when i enlisted .
didn't want to be a widow .
she's got a point .
after all this bullshit . . . . . . you still want to go kill women and children in rice paddies?
come on , paxton !
where you going , bozz?
i have no idea .
fuck .
we are gonna jump , my young friend !
shit , bozz , i'm too drunk .
come on , paxton .
i'll break my neck .
i don't want to go without you , man .
all right , i see what this is .
this jump , it's like this existential leap of faith .
abso fucking lutely .
i have no idea what that means .
we'll break those legs and get out of the war .
okay , let's go .
that's it , here we go .
i'm ready .
that's it .
it's gonna be on my count .
it'll be one , two , three .
let's break those legs .
okay , one !
two !
three !
was that the count?
that was the count .
okay , okay .
here we go , here we go .
hot girl .
oh , yeah , hot girl .
on my count again , one , two , three .
okay , one !
two !
three !
the legs won't move .
shit .
they're out for themselves .
goddamn it .
if that bottle was a leg , we'd be out of the war about now .
looks like that would really hurt .
oh , fuck .
canadian atlantic railway .
there's your ride out of here , bozz .
go to canada and live with a fucking moose?
no way , man .
mexico , that's where i'd disappear to .
can't you just smell it?
see it?
shit , i can smell it from here .
all that sunshine and tequila .
all those little senoritas walking around .
would you?
what?
if i told you about people who can get us to mexico . . . . . . away from the war , would you go?
no .
no , i wouldn't .
i enlisted , so there's a place for me .
if i don't go , somebody has to take that place .
and if they die , well . . . . . . they're dying for me .
you're a brave man .
you're the brave one , bozz .
bullshit .
courage is when you're the only guy who knows how shit scared you are .
then you're right .
i am the brave one .
let's get out of here .
we gotta get back .
fucking sergeant thomas will chew my ass for chow !
anytime today , private paxton .
i'm coming , private bozz .
fuck .
we should have jumped .
yeah .
we can always go back .
come on , man .

shut the fuck up .
you know he deserved every bit of it !
took four hours for my nose to stop bleeding .
get off it , wilson !
you had it coming , man !
i was just fucking with him .
if paxton here had kept quiet . . . . . . boy , you'd be in hell right now , sure as shit !
if i knew bozz would stop , i wouldn't have said anything .
apologize , bozz .
get off it .
you heard me , bozz .
you apologize to me right now .
yeah , bozz .
apologize to the man .
say , " i'm sorry i didn't kill your ass !
think that's funny?
fuck .
you tried to embarrass me in front of every fucking person here .
apologize .
cease firing !

unload that fucking weapon !
head or the body?
damn it , unload that piece !
fuck you , bozz .
unload that weapon !
fuck you , bozz !
fuck you !
it's jammed .
did you see that?
did you see that?
looks like a misfeed jammed it .
well , you are one lucky dick , bozz .
it would've killed you and the three people next to you .
hope you're not too disappointed .
what do you want to do?
how about get wilson as far the fuck away as possible , sir?
well , you have the right to press for a court martial .
otherwise , you can let us handle it our way .
i'd personally prefer that option .
consider it a personal favor to me .
get wilson out , sir .
i don't recall telling you to open your stinkhole .
he's right , sir .
wilson shouldn't be in the army .
even if he did try to kill somebody .
you and i need to exchange some ideas .
that doesn't solve our problem .
we need to get him out now or we'll file for a court martial .
paxton , you're dismissed .
yes , sir .
he's learning .
bozz , do you think the army's never seen pissants like you before?
i know you think you're some big swinging dick hero .
i know a lot of the men think so too .
but i know you for what you are .
you are a coward .
you're a born leader and you're afraid to take any real responsibility !
that's why you dropped out of school , why you drop out of everything !
you're pissing your life away !
i don't need the fucking army . . . . . . and i don't need the war to tell me that , sir !
get on your feet , soldier .
attention !
i don't want you in a stockade .
i don't want you recycled .
i don't want you drummed out on some bad conduct discharge .
i want you exactly where you are .
and we'll just naturally chew you up .
i'll take care of wilson .
you get the fuck out of my face .
sure glad they got wilson's ass out .
good riddance to bad rubbish .
shut your fucking mouth .
you shut the fuck up .
guys , relax .
i ain't starting .
you already got your ass beat once .
just watch your back in tigerland .
i'll do that .
i guess i'm supposed to joke about how i owe you my life .
he almost killed you .
you jealous?
you wanted to know what it was like .
what what was like?
the great lesson of being close to death .
know what i know?
same thing you know .
we're in a real bad way .
fuck .
real bad way .
all right !
let's go !
move it !
come on !
let's go !
come on !
move !

move your ass !
come on , fat boy !
move your ass !
let's go , soldier !
let's go !
let's go !
welcome to tigerland !
your final training before you're shipped overseas !
here , everything's done exactly as it is over there .
you will search and destroy , hunt and kill !
you'll move by chopper to secure any area deemed necessary .
you'll be allowed one hour's sleep .
minor mistakes will pay back major punishment .
maybe you've heard we've lost this war .
or we've lost the support of people here at home .
it's too late to ask those questions .
you're not back on the block .
you're alive in a year , we'll talk about it .
when you arrive in nam . . . . . . it's important to get acclimated as quickly as you can .
remember to think .
you understand me?
yes , sergeant !
what matters now is sharpening your ability to find and destroy the enemy .
practice how to stay alive .
i know what you're thinking .
i've been there myself .
you're thinking you'll go somewhere safe .
you'll luck out .
tigerland is where you stop bullshitting yourself .
sarge , you got any advice on how to stay alive in vietnam?
i do , private .
don't go .
right on , right on .
my friend here wants the experience .
says he ain't scared .
well , good luck .
if you ask me , i'll stick with the smart and the scared .
you'll be under the care of ncos and officers who were in combat .
listen to them .
they know what they're talking about .
cota .
i'm staff sergeant cota .
i've done two tours in vietnam .
my first in '67 with the 1 01 st .
ijust completed my second with mac v.
i only have two words of advice for you .
and those are to listen ... ... and to learn .
all right , let's saddle up .
let's go !
let's saddle up !
let's go , goddamn it !

i gotta take a piss .
you okay?
yeah .
jim paxton on personal guide to pain .
get that fucking torch out of my face and put that cigarette out .
dumb fuck grunts , right here .
you broke light discipline .
therefore , you're dead .
do you understand?
yes .
good .
i'm still alive , sergeant .
what did you say?
i said , i'm still alive .
i miraculously survived the attack .
you didn't get hit?
no .
are your friends alive?
yeah , paxton's good .
johnson , he's good and he's good .
if you're gonna make up a story , make up a happy one .
i ain't making anything up , son .
and in vietnam there are no happy fucking stories .
i had a best buddy , kelly morgan . . . . . . that i went to alt with .
in '67 , when the call came , we got sent off to nam .
we had only been in country a few days .
we was green as grass .
we were in a two man listening post , talking just like we are here .
kelly lit up a cigarette .
one minute we're naming his unborn child . . . . . . and the next second his brains were in my lap .
the sniper zeroed in on the cherry of his cigarette , bozz .
gentlemen , it's all about respect .
respect for your superiors and what they're trying to teach you .
respect for yourselves and your unit .
and most important . . .
. . . respect the enemy .
you have 42 minutes . . . . . . then the squad's on patrol .
fuck .
gentlemen , this is the best vietnamese village we could create for you . . . . . . here on the base !
now , listen .
you're all gooks , so nobody speaks english .
anybody asks you a question in english , you answer , " no bic .
it means , " i don't speak " in gook ese .
let's hear it .
no bic .
good .
private bozz , you are the only man that speaks english .
speak only to the man who identifies himself as interpreter .
understood?
yes , sir .
good .
private paxton .
you are the vietcong .
they come through , their objective is to find the vc sympathizer .
in other words , you , private paxton .
they have five minutes .
you tell them nothing .
i warn you , they're beat up .
they've been awake three nights .
forced marched all day .
they fuck this up , they'll march another six miles .
they find out which one of you is vc ... ... and you'll be the ones out in the boonies ... ... on no sleep , forced marching for the next two nights .
understood?
yes , sergeant .
let's get to work .
private bozz , paxton .
over here .
lets see . . . .
lukins , barnes , in this hooch .
make it as realistic as possible .
this is not a fucking joke .
i like this .
it's like a war theme park .
i'm so tired .
i'm gonna pass out .
hey , here they come .
shit .
it's wilson .
what?
i thought we got him out .
there's a war going on .
plenty of room for psychopathic killers .
let's move it .
we don't got much time .
we gotta find the vc .
no bic .
fuck me .
vc?

what are you writing in your journal?
don't fucking move !
let go of him , goddamn it !
you're in charge !
on your feet !
yes , sergeant .
where is your weapon , soldier?
there it is .
why didn't you secure the area , private wilson?
i'll tell you why .
because you lost control !
yes , sergeant .
did you find any vc?
no , you didn't .
that's the fucking answer .
come here .
i promise you tears before breakfast .
get your men and get out of here .
get out of here !
let's go .

is he all right?
no , he's not all right .
take your time .
you going?
i can't take you with me .
not me .
paxton .
he's hurting .
he signed up .
and you judged him for it .
you even made me feel guilty and i was drafted .
you saw what wilson did to him today .
he's broken down .
and the army didn't do all the breaking .
take him .
it's not my fault if he just realized what he did .
i only got time for my sad story .
take him with you .
fuck off !
wilson's gonna take his hate out on somebody .
you run , he'll kill paxton .
if not here , for sure over in nam .
johnson , i like you , but fuck off .
yeah , well , i ain't standing in your way .
rise and shine , gentlemen !
let's go , gentlemen !
roll 'em !
let's go !

get on your feet !
i know you're tired , but you'll be doing a lot of this in the next year !
if you're not . . . . . . then you're in a body bag .
where's bozz?
waiting for a dust off .
where is your squad leader?
is this his weapon?
does anybody know where your squad leader is?
where is he , johnson?
where is your weapon , private bozz?
right here , sarge .
i know that .
the next time you decide to take a piss or a fucking shit . . . . . . you make sure you have your weapon .
your weapon is your lifeline .
why didn't you have it?
i was gonna make a break for mexico .
i didn't think i'd need it .
very funny .
you take point .
paxton , take slack .
johnson , drag .
the rest of you fall in behind .
listen up .
you'll square off against the boys from yesterday .
they may have booby traps .
they may have forward observers watching .
they may do all manner of shit that you don't know .
that's why you will keep your eyes open and your mouths shut .
is that fucking understood?
yes , sarge .
let's move out .
