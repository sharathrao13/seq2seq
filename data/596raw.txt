my poor baby .
who has stolen the child's dream?
the mad genius krank in his evil scheme .
to what vicious depths will he not descend?
will the tale turn to tragedy ... or have a happy end?
step up , ladies and gentlemen !
step right up !
come closer .
don't be afraid .
see the strongest man in the world .
look at those chains , made of the same steel ... as that used to lift
yes , my friends
the true light is invisible .
penetrate the corridor of shadows ... and you will enter the world of the chosen ones .
renounce the gift of sight .
i know there are skeptics among you ... afraid to share with us the dead of night .
be brave .
renounce your gift of sight .
pluck out your eyes .
come and join us .
help us build a better world .
the crusher bones is going to try once more to shatter steel ... only using the power of his mighty arms .
please , ladies and gentlemen , i want absolute silence ... during the demonstration .
i must beg of you , for your own safety ... not to look him in the eyes ... because his power of concentration is so great ... that he might provoke a cerebral hemorrhage ... in the weaker ones among you .
mr. one , ready?
and now , attention !
little thief !
stealing money from orphans .
i'll teach you !
let go of that !
what's going on?
what's the matter?
the poor man's not well .
don't move !
don't move or i'll waste you !
denree !
kill him !
who's that?
he's the strong man at the fun fair .
i don't know him .
what do you want?
i have lost little brother .
he didn't come all by himself .
well , well , kiddies , hard at work?
it looks like you're doing really well .
thanks for waiting for us .
thank you .
just remember , my ears are so sharp ... that i can hear you think .
go buy yourself some sweets .
don't overdo it .
come on .
move your bum .
go on .
here .

those rotten cyclops .
don't worry .
we know where to find them .
and him?
what about him?
you helped us out .

now we're even .
hey , girl .
cyclops .

our wish is most sincere
we hope this cake of ours will bring you happiness
good fortune and success

ln fair or foul weather we'll always be together
happy birthday , uncle irvin .
a cake for me?
you're really too kind .
are you ready , children?
not you .
you've got a cold .
one , two .
what is all this bellowing about?
but , sweetheart , it's irvin's birthday .
irvin's birthday?
why , of course .
how could i have forgotten?
let us celebrate .
let us all make merry .
everyone , let's shout !
scream out !
krank , come back .
i had a thought last night .
if these children only have nightmares ... it's perhaps because the evil is in you .
why not seek the cause of your torment ... in the molecular study of your own tears?
who could make me cry?
well , boss ... we could make you cry with laughter .
i am a gnome a bag of bones
a man of means and full of beans
the girls in spain sing my refrains
i've such a pain that it's insane
you mustn't be angry .
your brothers are doing their best .
my brothers?
may i give it a try?
go ahead , mollusk .
once upon a time , there was an inventor so gifted ... that he could create life .
truly remarkable man .
ah , a fairy tale .
i can already feel tears in my eyes .
since he had no wife or children ... he decided to make them in his laboratory .
he started with his wife and fashioned her ... into the most beautiful princess in the world .
alas , a wicked genetic fairy cast a spell on the inventor ... so much so that the princess was only knee high to a grasshopper .
he then cloned six children in his own image .
faithful , hardworking , they were so alike ... no one could tell them apart .
but fate tricked him again , giving them all sleeping sickness .
craving someone to talk to , he grew in a fish tank ... a poor migraine ridden brain .
and then , at last , he created his masterpiece ... more intelligent than the most intelligent man on earth .
but , alas , the inventor made a serious mistake .
while his creation was intelligent , he , too , had a defect .
he never , ever had a dream .
you can't imagine how quickly he grew old ... because he was so unhappy .
boss .
there !
an eye dropper , quick !
an eye dropper !
then the poor masterpiece became so crazed ... that he believed a single teardrop could save him .
and , after committing many cruel deeds ... he died a horrible death ... never knowing what it is to dream .
get out !
all of you , get out !
good bye , uncle .
happy birthday .
see you tonight .
silence ... you glub !
what do you expect us to do with that?
i wouldn't waste a nail to hang it up .
but it's pretty , isn't it?
don't get smart with us .
the picklock won't always be there to save your behind .
all right , get lost .
that's all?
afraid so .
if you keep being sassy
you'll be sorry .
there's no shortage of orphans , miette .
listen carefully , tadpole .
you don't want to go to the hole , do you?
it's very cold there .
and pitch black .
and full of spiders .
so give us all the rest .
the rest .
there's a fine lad .
see?
when you want to .
now , the second shift .
the neighborhood's calm , isolated .
but be careful .
you never know .
there's a backyard .
you'll go that way with all the stuff .
on the landing , there are three doors .
one is locked from inside .
that's the one that must be forced .
behind is what interests us .
here's the prize .
it's identical to the one where he hides his loot .
the problem with this safe : it takes two hours to crack it .
two hours?
we're going to get caught .
we have no choice , unless you know someone capable of carrying it .
somebody got in .
you big idiot !
he's right here now .
do i pay you to sleepwalk?
who is this guy?
don't ask me .
i know who he is .
the strong man at the fair , the one who breaks his chains .
are you thinking what i'm thinking?
nice going , mr. one .
one don't like whistles .
one not thief .
a thief?
who's a thief?
we're not stealing , just borrowing .
what he said?
he said you can take it back .
it just won't be as heavy .
the true light .
little brother .
renounce the gift of sight and penetrate the corridor of shadows ... the world of the blind .
that guy is crazy .
the octopus will kill us .
tell her i'll bring him back .
i won't be long .
help us build a befter world ... or we shall witness a reign of terror .
one !
where do you think you're going?
cyclops truck .
denree , little brother .
what about the truck?
cyclops truck .
kidnap denree .
kidnap little brother .
you know something?
you won't find cyclops truck like that .
when you get there , someone will have eaten denree .
the wolf will have eaten him .
take a break .
no use wearing out your shoes .
i know where the truck's going .
miette and one together?
and then what?
and anyway , how old was this brother of yours?
little , little brother .
found him ... one night ... on his rubbish bin , crying .
one comes close .
discover
okay , i can guess the rest .
he's just like i thought .
he's too little to bother .
let's go .
we have to get out of here .
stupid !
imbecile !
idiot !
have you finished?
my crystal glasses are broken !
you'll crack my chandelier !
are you calmer now?
one look for denree .
see you .
oh , come on , fat head .
where did those brats go?
i don't know .
it's the big guy's fault .
miette's different since he came .
does he have all the jewels?
that's all he's interested in?
you had big ideas?
poor little tadpole .
you haven't fallen in love , too , like the others?
get to bed !
filthy brats .
all the same .
we really can't count on them .
raise crows , they'll rip out  your eyes .
it's the best ones who want to go .
it's not the first time it's happened .
it's always the same old story .
remember little lucas six years ago?
and marcus before .
yes , marcus .
i'd almost forgotten him .
when we think  of everything we've done for them .
and if she had an accident?
you never know .
at that moment , the winkles suddenly break into a dance ... then cast off their shells and begin to use them as megaphones ... to announce the concert .
winkles , winkles .
shells , shells .
and then , at that moment ... all the winkles cast off their shells ... and use them as megaphones to announce the concert .
the winkles?
the winkles cast off their shells?
please continue .
continue , and with colors as well .
yes , yes , yes .
then the hammerhead shark plays xylophone with the catfish bones .
the walrus plays the jew's harp with the ... the sperm whale's suspenders .
the sea is blue like the sky ... and the sky is blue like the south seas .
and i don't know if i'm swimming in the sky or ... or flying at the bottom of the sea .
i swear it gives me the shivers .
shivers?
shivers all over .
and igloos?
oh , yes , tell me about the igloos .
igloos that turn into mushrooms .
ah , it's you , my boy .
i was expecting you .
not so loud .
turn it down .
the boss might hear you .
the boss?
he's out of a test tube , like all of us .
lay the boy in the sarcophagus and come here .
but before
well , you promised me
what's tormenting you , my son?
well , this story that among us there's an original clone ... different from the others .
is that true?
of course it's true .
the others are nothing but cheap copies ... while the original one is unique .
unique?
yes .
and do you know who it is?
do you really want to know?
connect yourself to the child .
to the child?
yes .
connect myself to the child?
but i can't .
it's forbidden .
exactly .
the others wouldn't dare , but you , you can do it ... because you're the original .
me?
i'm the original?
but it's not lonely being the original?
all the penguins , the centipedes , everyone applauds .
except , even if you climb to the treetops ... it's impossible to catch the candy floss .
and so , everybody climbs to the top of the mountain ... except the giraffes who , of course , stay in one spot ... munching the clouds .
sleep .
sleep , my little one .
i am the sandman ... and you can't resist me .
your eyelids are so heavy .
sleep , my little one .
the snowflakes evaporate ... and then turn into haitstones .
in the farmyards ...
the turkeys scramble towards ...
the hailstones .
the better to peck them?
and then when the children's voices cry for help ... the chickens are merciless .
there .
now he's going to come around very nicely .
who , the boss?
no , the child .
he's a real nightmare factory .
what's that?
a fuse blew !
perfect .
be careful .
someone will hear you .
it's hard to be original .
now , throw this message uh , bottle into the sea .
yes .
go on !
may someone find my plea to get it over with .
i ...
gabriel marie ...
i came into this world with open eyes ... but i saw a world ... that was a world of dogs .
litter of dogs !
and so , the creator ... sent me down here to earth ... to recover the power ... that men have illegally seized .
my brothers ... you who have joined me in this struggle ... understand that together we must fight ... human beings ... from their own grounds .
the world ... of appearances .
t thought we had agreed on half a dozen .
but you know it's becoming more and more difficult .
people are suspicious .
they've put up posters .
in any case , this batch is as fresh as they come .
not one of them is over five years old .
listen .
let us have maybe a couple of hours ... and we'll sort this thing out .
only the third eye ... will enable you to enter ... the world of appearances .
but beware ... because this sordid world of temptation and perversion ... is also the world of desire .
try , brother angel joseph ... to discover it ... without your losing sight ... of the only true light .
be strong .
my brothers ... our grace ... our great superior race ... shall reign once more ... on earth !
from that day on ... our faithful third eye ... will become useless ... as the world of appearances ... will be abolished .
it's denree .
i see !
what's that?
that , brother angel joseph ... is a female .
a female .
do you have a problem?
what's that?
that is a condemned man .
take them .
go on !
come back when those idiots have had enough .
search her !
what is it?
kill her !
she's clean .
then tomorrow night at pier 24 .
100, 000 .
we'll never get half that .
one more scrap of information .
a girl in a red dress ... with a big moron .
we found these on them .
but there was much more in the
what'll you do with them?
a midnight snack for the fishes , tonight , pier 24 .
a midnight snack for the fishes .
irvin?
such a migraine .
you know all about feelings .
won't you try to help me?
won't you explain why all those children only have nightmares?
'cause you were their nightmare .
you can persecute all the children in the world ... but there's one thing you'll never have .
what?
a soul .
because you believe you have one?
you don't even have a body .
he who created us made us all monsters .
no , krank , you're wrong .
you are the only monster here .
be quiet !
he's the only one responsible .
for that , i say i'm innocent .
i'm innocent !
anyway ...
i thank you for your help .
hurry up !
and don't break any of the baubles .
well done .
and don't cut yourself .
are you sure that we're doing the right thing?
of course , my pet .
all children love it .
lift your elbow .
why worry , krank?
if you're sincere , you have nothing to lose .
how are you , marcello?
what's it to you?
we need you , marcello , and your creepy crawlies .
have you still got the knack?
no , please , not again .
i paid enough already .
nice place  you've got here , marcello .
i'm glad to see it hasn't changed much .

the boy ate your dinner .
it doesn't matter .
you were hungry , no doubt , my angel .

the merciless burden of solitude .
and no one no one is spared .
not even great minds .
and that shows ... just how much i appreciate a visit ... that's as spontaneous as yours .
i'm glad i have no ears to hear such nonsense .
it's getting rather late for irvin .
he becomes so tired .
i'm sorry , uncle irvin .

he was a sailor who worked the minefields .
you tattooed the map on him .
he will be most honored to answer your question .
what on earth is that , mama?
it can't be a submarine .
it's going through the mines .
it's the messiah .
the messiah has come to save us .
the messiah walked on top of the water .
two hands are better than one .
hello , miette .
oh , no !
don't say you've forgotten us .
days and nights without news .
we were beginning to worry about you .
don't bother .
we're never coming back .
right , one?
truer words were never said .
you'd better give us those jewels , quick .
good work .
very good .
now we'll play a little tune for you in our own way .
a farewell tune .
all right?
he's killing her .
will you keep quiet?
shut up , i said !
will you shut up?
there's been an accident !
the two little brats got away , zee .
but it's not over , is it?
they're hiding .
and why are they hiding?
because they don't want to play .
so that's why they hide .
why , it's you , my little flea .

you old hag !
i'm going to kill you !
i'll kill you first !
i'll tear your nose off !
die !
if i die , you die too !
think you can live forever .
always better than anyone else .
you ugly old bitch !
not a migraine tonight .
i want you in impeccable condition .
your concern is really touching .
has the boy put you into such good spirits?
a perfect specimen that is totally uninhibited .
tonight is my last chance .
what is it?
the thing is here , mama .
in the house .
what do we do now?
don't you panic !
are you men?
yes or no?
no .
well , that's enough !
inspection and report !
the explosives !
they've disappeared .
it came from there .
there must be a passage .
too small .
mouse hole .
it's worth a try .
i'm off .
we're really starting to get attached .
concentrate on my voice , krank .
you're sinking into sleep .
you're falling into a void .
always deeper .
together , we shall open a door .
please don't hurt me .
don't hurt me .
good bye , grasshopper .
you , professor .
there's no more professor , martha .
just a terrible mistake .
it must be erased .
say , i recognize you .
so , little crayfish , huh?
you fell into a strange net , huh?
run .
run before it's too late .
does it hurt?
yes .
i'm allergic to steel .
it's nothing .
he'll erase everything , like a mistake , you see .
he explained it to me .
you'll feel better after .
yes .
he really knows .
he's the original .
what are you doing?
i found him .
who?
there .
the original .
the original?
quite a shock , no?
the original .
that's the original .
but i'm the original .
it's me !
no , i'm the original .
smell that .
33 % sodium nitrate , 20 glycerine carbonate and s02 .
very strange .
you remind me of someone .
all of you .
well , come on .
back to work , huh?
hey !
and the kids?
you've forgotten?
of course !
the little children .
i came for them .
i even brought them this .
and this .
give them back to them , huh?
come on !
let's go !
please , help me !
which is the way out?
miss?
miss?
the passage there .
take the key .
here .
but don't hurt him .
go save the children .
here you are at last .
i've been waiting so long .
is someone there?
i'm the one speaking .
in the fish tank .
come closer .
don't be afraid .
it's you who's speaking , mister?
the mines .
the oil rig in your dream .
remember?
that was my message .
don't try to trick me , too , mister .
get up , little brother .
we have to go .
wake up , now .
oh , no !
you'll kill him !
he's under a spell .
there's only one way .
go find the child where he is in the clutches of evil .
inside the dream .
look , no hands !
i don't believe this .
what am i doing here?
don't worry .
everything will be all right .
if you say so , mister .
it's funny .
i don't even know the little brother .
but i know you .
the little brother could have been yours .
don't be afraid .
just relax .
now , close your eyes , listen to my voice ... and sleep .
be brave , little girl .
who are you?
why are you in my dream?
why is it his dream?
because he's not afraid of me .
please let me take his place .
what would you get in exchange?
a brother .
if i take his place , maybe i'll see his big brother again .
you are trying to trap me , aren't you?
you don't risk very much .
so be it .
well , my chickadee , huh?
sometimes it's better to land in the muck , huh?
hey , you'd better get out of this place .
it's going sky high !
i had a weird dream .
i was very , very old .
and you were dead .
the void equals infinity !
oh , no , uncle !
heave , ho !
row faster , guys !
it's following us !
what do you mean , following us?
untie the bowlines , idiots .
come back !
it's me !
your creator !
i made you !
i gave you life !
irvin !
you hear me?
