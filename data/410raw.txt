23 . 976 dvdrip
in the movvies , dracula wears a cape , and some old english guy always manages to savve the day at the last minute with crosses and holy water .
but evverybody knows the movvies are full of shit .
the truth is it started with blade , and it ended with him .
the rest of us werejust along for the ride .
what's this chicken scratch?
it's cuneiform .
it's about 4, 000 years old .
so why here?
because this is the cradle of civilization .
he would've been comfortable here .
i don't know , dan .
this seems like another dead end .
there's something beneath us .
you find a watch?
is it a body?
guys?
aah !
go !
aah !
what the fuck? !
aah !
tonight , dr. edgar vance , forensic psychiatrist and author of the new york times bestseller human health ,
the whole being breaktthrough .
also with us , martin vreede , chief of police .
they'll be here for the next hour , and they'll be taking your calls , next on bently tittle livve .
okay , dr. vance .
you are a psychiatrist and a biochemist .
isn't that true?
yes , bently .
i am both .
and it's for a reason .
i have always believed that true health can only be achieved if we reconcile the body and the mind .
and of course , in order to do that , we have to get rid of a lot of old notions .
okay .
and ... how's that fit in with vampires?
in the case of vampires , we're dealing with creatures that , uh , are the repositories of some of our most taboo thoughts .
okay .
predatory rage .
yeah .
sexual sadism .
sexual?
sexual sadism .
these are very scary subjects for people to own up to , and they're right inside .
so what you're saying is we pass the buck onto someone else .
you bet we do .
and vampires ...?
well , for instance , there's a hereditary blood disease .
i talk about it in my book .
it's called porphyria .
and the symptoms of this disease are remarkably similar to classic vampire traits .
the people who suffer from this disease are anemic , they become intolerant to sunlight , they can't handle garlic ...
garlic?
chief vreede .
okay .
what's your take on all these rumors we've been hearing about vampires?
vampires , vampires .
what?
the only vampires i'm worried about are the ones passing the bar exam .
seriously , though .
if vampires existed , don't you think we would've found them by now?
the truth is our streets have never been safer .
homicide , assaults , violent crime is down across the board .
if people want to be concerned , they should focus in on characters like this blade criminal .
now , that's the guy i wanna hear about .
i wanna hear about this character blade .
what about him?
he's a sociopath that we've been pursuing .
blade is a troubled individual .
i understand that he is under the impression that there is a vast conspiracy of vampires .
now , you've got to look at the psychiatric underpinnings of a belief like that .
odds are he believes that he is out there slaying monsters .
but what he's really doing ...
mm hmm . ... is trying to kill aspects of himself .
aah !
aah !
ah !
aah !
i'm on the stonebridge overpass .
got it .
heading westbound .
i'm just beneath ya .
go !
aah !
aah !
come on !
i got him .
pull !
you all right , man?
he's got a gun !
oh , my god !
ouch .
staked you with silver .
why aren't you ash?
why aren't you smarter?
not a vampire , dumb shit !
set your sorry ass up .
damn .
oh , blade .
what the fuck happen tonight?
how should i know?
he was human .
you're gettin 'reckless , blade .
killing vampires is clean .
they ash ... don't leave any evidence behind .
killing humans is messy .
you better hope nobody id'd you .
this worked really good .
what's this?
a new delivery system for your serum .
it's an effervescent inhaler .
just bite down on the mouth guard .
delivery's automatic .
some friends of mine made it .
friends?
yeah .
you remember those?
it was horrible .
the one car crashed , and then the guy in the coat was shooting the other guy .
it looked like there was a lot of blood .
thankyou .
that was just a taste of the mayhem that occurred during tonight's brazen shootout that left at least four people dead .
now , apparently , an anonymous citizen captured the whole evvent on vvideo .
hey , ray .
hey , we got a lead .
let's catch a plane , wilson .
it's time to take these cowboys down .
that's what i'm talkin 'about .
what's he been doing?
fuck all .
just feeding .
been through five of them so far .
do you think we have enough security?
we didn't capture him .
he allowed us to take him in .
you understand?
i'm gonna go in .
you shouldn't have woken me .
we had to .
your blood , your sacrament , can set us free now .
what makes you think i care?
your people need you .
my people?
you're nothing but shadows of your former selves .
look how far you have fallen .
the world's changed since your time .
the humans have a new hunter .
blade .
and you'd like me to kill him , wouldn't you?
yes .
subject is heading west .
got him .
congratulations .
you're famous .
somebody nailed us .
your face is all over the papers and television .
media's eatin 'it up .
like i care .
well , you should .
something like this ... taking out a human ... as far as the rest of the world is concerned , you're public enemy number one .
didn't know this was a popularity contest .
damn it , blade .
don't you see what they're doing?
they're waging a goddamn p. r. campaign .
now it's not just vampires we gotta worry about , we're gonna have to take on the rest of the world , too .
you worry too much , old man .
that's why we're still alive , goddamn it .
i've been doing this since before you were born , blade .
you're like a son to me .
i'm sorry i got old on ya .
i see you alone , surrounded by enemies .
and it breaks my heart .
we can't win this war alone .
look , he just gave me the evil eye .
come on , man .
what about that guy? !
bro and prostitute , baby .
so what?
quit fucking around .
i'm hungry , and i want to eat somebody .
how about him?
no fatties .
they taste like cheetos .
no , i like him .
wait ... what about that?
shrunken apple headed bitch .
they fucking saw us over there .
fucking blow me , man !
just pick one already .
jesus christ !
oh , got it !
got it !
baby on board .
oh !
looks like we got ourselves a combo meal !
chicky , chicky , chicky , chicky , chicky !
oh , yeah , baby !
what's for dinner?
aah !
hey , pretty lady .
no !
no !
no !
scream if this hurts , chica .
aah !
fuck you?
aah !
garlic !
scream if this hurts , chica .
aah !
what is it?
what you were worried about .
let's go , let's go , let's go !
shoot to kill !
aah !
move a finger and you're dead .
how's about this one?
he's got something in his hand !
get out , blade !
shit !
what's going on in there?
somebody talk to me !
aah !
hold it right there !
don't shoot , don't shoot .
rise and shine , sleepyhead .
special agents ray cumberland , wilson hale , fbl .
we've been tracking you a long time .
mm hmm .
whistler .
dead .
just like all your victims .
say , how many people have you killed , blade?
thirty?
forty?
fifty?
1, 182 .
but they were all familiars .
people who work with them .
oh .
and by " them , " you mean vampires , right?
say , so how do you kill these bloodsuckers , tough guy?
maybe you could give us a few pointers .
you can stake 'em , right?
what about sunlight?
i mean , they ain't feelin 'sunlight , right?
what about crosses?
do they still work , wilson , in this day and age?
i don't know , ray .
i mean , what if mister homey vampire is , like , jewish?
that's a good point .
what about garlic?
does that work on hindu vampires?
or do you need , like , saffron or some shit?
that was quick .
thank you .
you can keep doing your song and dance as long as you want , blade .
it's not gonna play .
we knowwhat you are .
you're a stone cold killer .
and you're sick as fuck .
let's leave the diagnosis to the professionals .
hello , blade .
my name is dr. vance .
i've been charged with giving you a psychiatric evaluation .
gentlemen , would you mind giving us just a couple of minutes alone?
he's all yours .
i know you must find this very frightening ... ... but i want you to know that i'm here to help .
and in order for me to do that ,
i'm gonna have to ask you a couple of questions , okay?
you know , blade ... the darndest thing .
i was signing in at security , and , uh , couldn't remember the date .
do you knowwhat day it is?
how about the president?
you knowwho that is .
who's in the white house right now?
an asshole .
i think somebody here wants to talk about vampires .
vampires .
for everyone else , it's kind of silly .
i had a set of wax teeth when i was seven years old .
it was fun .
i could be somebody else .
but i want to hear you talk about vampires .
what can you tell me about them?
they exist .
are you one of them?
sometimes ... the scariest monster of all ... ... is the one in the mirror .
tell me about blood .
when you drink blood , do you ever feel sexually aroused?
just strikes me that this business of vampirism has a very strong element of sexual confusion .
nuzzling into someone's neck .
a nocturnal visit .
it promises a ... delicious physical intimacy .
the very sweet taste of saliva ... mixed with skin .
sounds good to me .
where's it come from?
that's what i wanna know .
and i'm starting to wonder what your relationship with your mother was like .
were the two of you very close?
he's psychotic .
no shit .
for his safety and for the public's ,
i'm recommending that he be transferred immediately to county psychiatric ...
fuck that !
that man is my prisoner .
he's wanted in connection with a laundry list of federal crimes .
hold on , gentlemen .
we're in my jurisdiction now .
you got a problem with that , you talk to the local magistrate .
that man is my prisoner !
the call has already been made .
don't fuck with my thing !
there's a team from the hospital effecting the transfer immediately .
you're supposed to be working with us on this , chief .
not this time .
this is just a little something to keep you compliant .
the usual dose for this sort of thing is two , three hundred milligrams , but i think with a big , strapping hybrid like yourself ,
i'll kick it up to a couple thousand .
you don't have a problem with needles , do ya?
there .
that wasn't so bad , was it?
ooh , you're weak .
in need of your serum .
that must be a bad feeling .
i mean , who would've imagined that a mere human like me could overpower you .
you're one of them .
a familiar .
going on five years now .
it's the endgame , blade .
all their plans are coming to fruition .
why don't you just sit back and enjoy the show?
i hate familiars .
it's why we're still alivve , goddamn it .
you're like a son to me .
sorry i got old on ya .
i see you alone , surrounded by enemies .
it breaks my heart .
hi , blade .
so glad to finally meet you .
i am such a fan .
i like your tattoos .
do they mean anything?
stupid .
are you okay?
are you tired?
you're weak .
we moved the humans around .
like pawns .
we used them ... ... to flush you out .
you're not so big .
you're all alone , blade .
no one's gonna help you now .
evening , ladies .
hannibal king !
wake up , blade .
this is your rescue .
go !
freeze !
whistler !
this way !
blade !
you're dead !
get down !
blade .
hey , hey .
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa !
where are you going?
where the fuck is he going?
this is supposed to be a rescue !
get back , get back !
we're pinned down .
i can't shoot around corners .
i can .
aah !
okay .
we're fucked .
we're fine .
forgot my sword .
whoo !
come on !
abby .
aah !
we got him .
we'll be there soon .
who the hell are you people?
well , my name is hannibal king .
and this little hellion right here is abigail .
whistler's daughter .
i thought the vampires killed whistler's family .
they did .
i was born later out of wedlock .
when i came of age , i tracked my dad down , and i told him i wanted in .
been doing it ever since .
welcome to the honeycomb hideout .
how do you bankroll this operation?
i date a lot of older men .
come on , man , i'm joking .
you met dex .
this is hedges .
sommerfield ... she's the one who built that new serum inhaler of yours .
that runt you saw earlier , that was sommerfield's daughter zoe .
we call ourselves the nightstalkers .
hmm .
sounds like rejects from a saturday morning cartoon .
we were gonna go with the care bears , but , uh , that was taken .
how many of you are there?
there's enough .
we operate in sleeper cells .
when one goes down , another cell activates to pick up the slack .
consider us your reinforcements .
what , you amateurs are supposed to be helping me?
you?
look at you .
you're kids .
you're not ready to roll with this .
i mean , look at the way you're dressed .
what , that's supposed to be tactical?
what is this?
what is that?
fuck you .
it's a joke , huh?
what the fuck is wrong with y'all?
y'all think this is a joke?
you think this is a fucking sitcom?
okay , first off , that's just rude .
second , i'm pretty sure we saved your ass back there .
i'm impressed .
look , blade , my father meant for us to help you .
like it or not , we are all you got .
what the hell makes you think you know about hunting vampires?
well , here's for starters .
i used to be one .
do i pass the audition?
rookies .
fucking hannibal king !
i should've ripped his bleeding heart out when i had the chance !
ugh !
ugh !
we had blade .
we had him !
ugh !
and don't tell me " i told you so , " asher .
what's wrong , half pint?
you need a time out?
blow me .
we got caught with our pants down .
pants down?
they pretty much fucking ass raped us .
oh , you loved it .
has he been told?
about your failure?
yes .
maybe it's time i joined the game .
you know the kind of woman that just screams trouble?
you see her and every warning bell in your brain starts going off , but you still manage to ask for her number .
well , that's all i ever hook up with .
but this betty ...
whoa !
she blew 'em all away in the shitstorm sweepstakes .
her name is danica talos .
you met her earlier .
and unlike typical vampires , her fangs are located in her vagina .
moving on .
the man on her left is her brother asher , and this walking diaper stain is jarko grimwood .
i picked danica up in a bar and spent the next five years playing hide and go suck as her little vampire cabana boy .
eventually , abigail found me .
sommerfield managed to treat me with a cure , and now i kill them .
and that's basically turning a frown upside down .
we need to pool our resources , blade .
we "?
yeah , we .
he's come back .
take a look at this .
you gotta be kidding me .
where'd you guys get this stuff?
i stole most of it .
danica had a huge collection .
you got stonework , ironwork , weaponry , art .
it's this stuff that shows up everywhere .
this symbol , this glyph ...
it's on everything in here .
he is real .
you dig beneath all the ... the myths , all the layers of bullshit that have cluttered our culture for the last 500 years , and eventually you're gonna strike the truth .
so the movies are true .
the movies are just a comforting fairy tale compared to the real deal .
bram stoker ... he wrote a good yarn , but the events that he described back in 1897 ...
god .
that was just a tiny piece of the mosaic .
the real dracula ... his origins date back much , much earlier than that .
how early?
try six or seven thousand years .
this is a piece of his armor .
with it , we were able to extrapolate a basic idea of what this fucker looked like .
check this out .
dracula's only one of the names he's gone by .
the babylonians worshipped him as dagon , and now they call him drake .
if you believe in the legends , he was born in ancient sumeria .
nobody really knows the specifics of his origin , but we do know this .
he was the first of his kind .
the patriarch of hominus nocturna .
he was born perfect .
and just like the great white shark , this guy has never had to evolve .
forget the movies , forget the books .
there's no happy ending with this guy .
he's been there , moving behind the scenes , cutting a bloody fucking path through the ages , until suddenly ... ... just like that ...
... he up and disappeared .
and then we heard a rumor .
the vampires were searching for him .
some say he'd been sleeping through the ages , that he'd retreated from a world he'd become disgusted with .
and according to our information , they found him in iraq about six months ago .
and he was pissed .
don't try to use my name , that's fatal
tried to claim my fame , but that's fatal
about to raise the pain , that's fatal
tried to claim my fame , but that's fatal
about to raise the pain , that's fatal
bite through your jugular vein , that's fatal
in the window ...
you sell vampire merchandise?
uh , yeah .
look around .
we might have a few things .
we've got dracula lunchboxes .
did you see those?
there's bobble heads , key chains .
this is funny .
that garlic gets me evvery time .
we've got just about anything .
even vampire vibrators .
here .
check this out .
dra cola .
makes you want to cry , doesn't it?
was there something special you needed?
hey , guy .
she's talkin 'to ya .
what?
you wanna kiss me , pretty boy?
aah !
no !
tried to claim my fame , but that's fatal
about to raise the pain , that's fatal
bite through your jugular vein , that's fatal
aah !
aah !
bite through your jugular vein , that's fatal
why wake up drake now?
that's exactly what we've been trying to figure out .
when i was under the fang , there used to be talk about some kind of vampire final solution .
but i could never figure out why they'd want to destroy their food source .
i mean , that makes no sense , right?
they've always had plans for the human race , and it seems likely that whatever they're cooking up ,
drake's return is part of it .
let's face it .
we are fighting a losing battle here .
so we kill a few hundred of them a year ... big deal .
there are thousands of them out there , maybe tens of thousands .
we need a new tactic .
like what?
a biological weapon .
for you sighted people ... ... here's a little show and tell .
for the last year , i've been working with synthesized dna in order to create an artificial virus targeted specifically at vampires .
we're calling it daystar .
think about it , blade .
we could wipe 'em all out in one single move .
so what's been holding you back?
the lethality in vampires is still spotty .
the bottom line is we need a better strand of dna to work with .
we need dracula's blood .
because dracula is the progenitor of the vampire race , his dna is still pure .
it hasn't been diluted by a hundred generations of selective mutation .
we get his blood , we can boost daystar's viral efficacy to 100 % .
all the vampires go bye bye .
so , can we just go right ahead and sign you up for one of our secret nightstalker decoder rings?
oh .
holy shit .
um , gentlemen and hottie , uh , we have a wide assortment of ass kickery for your viewing pleasure today .
electronic pistol ... comes in a variety of tasty calibers .
explosive rounds .
yeah , but with a concentrated burst of uvlight instead of your standard hollow points .
i call 'em sun dogs .
hedges .
super size me , sweetheart .
this little pea shooter ... it's a modified version of the army's objective individual combat weapon .
pick your poison ... sun dogs , stakes , heat seeking mini rockets .
basically , whatever gets you hard , this puppy'll pump 'em out .
course , it doesn't have the range of a sword , but ...
oh , god .
over here , we , um ... we call this the uvarc .
whoa .
sorry .
the two points are connected by a powerful uvlaser ...
hedges , i'll take it from here .
yes .
this bad boy is half as hot as the sun .
it can cut through vampires like a knife through butter .
we're still trying to sort out fact from fiction when it comes to dracula .
turning into mist?
kinda doubt it .
general shape shifting?
maybe .
not into a bat or a wolf or anything like that , but another human , with practice , could be possible .
because he wouldn't have a traditional skeletal structure .
something more like a snake's , with thousands of tiny bones ...
i have a ...
i have a question about that , hedges .
have you ever been laid?
many times .
with ladies .
time for a little pressure .
the weakest link in the vampire chain of command has always been their familiars .
since the vampires can't go out in the daylight , they get the humans to do all their dirty work .
we bleed the wannabes ...
sooner or later , they'll take us right to the real .
i got you some newwheels .
you take care of it now .
she's making playlists .
she likes to listen to mp3s when she hunts .
it's like her own internal soundtrack , you know?
dark core , trip hop , whatever kids are listening to these days .
me , i'm more of a david hasselhoff fan , you know?
come on , come on like that , ya'll
come on , come on , like that , y'all
let me see you say ho
let me see you say ho
aah !
ah !
aah !
eventually , you know , your head is gonna pop off .
fuck !
no , no !
please , please !
please .
who's your handler?
i don't know my fucking handler .
i swear .
i swear !
oh , shit !
please !
please !
oh , it's you .
i'll take that .
come on !
let's go !
come on !
hello?
hello?
hello , this is dr. vance .
you paged me .
it's for you .
yeah , go ahead .
hello?
aah !
you know , at some point , you , uh , you might want to consider sitting down with somebody .
you know?
have a little share time?
kick back?
get in touch with your inner child?
that sort of thing?
also ... just a thought ... but you might wanna consider blinking once in a while .
i'm sorry , i , uh , i ate a lot of sugar today .
hey .
you just can't walk in here like ... aah !
excuse me , sir .
don't do that .
where's vance?
i'm sorry , but you can't see dr. vance right now .
sit .
can i , uh , can i help you?
remember me?
time for payback .
all right , vance , what the hell do you know?
oh , jesus .
it's him .
abby .
it's drake !
aah !
so , you're the hunter they all fear .
i had a feeling about you .
just shoot him !
go ahead , blade .
show me what you're made of .
aah !
23 . 976 dvdrip
aah !
oh , my god !
he got my baby !
aah !
no !
my baby !
ah , careful , daywalker .
i've been told about you .
your weakness for humans .
why'd you kill vance?
he'd outlived his purpose .
he died a good death .
quick , clean .
i wouldn't know anything about that .
you will .
how are you able to survive in sunlight?
haven't you read stoker's fable?
i was the first of the vampires .
i am unique .
so that's why they brought you back .
of course .
they believe through me they could become daywalkers .
look at them down there .
scurrying around like insects .
they don't know anything about honor or living by the sword , not like you and i do .
do you think they could ever grasp what it means to be immortal?
you're not immortal .
i must've heard hundreds of you rodents make the same claim .
each one of them have tasted the end of my sword .
perhaps i will too , then , but i think it is more likely the next time we meet , you fall before mine .
catch !
cootchie coo .
did you see that guy?
we're gonna lose , man .
we're gonna ...
oh !
god !
we're gonna fucking lose !
what did the one lesbian vampire say to the other?
shut up , king .
see you in 28 days .
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa .
hold on .
what are you ... what is that?
what are you doing?
it's an elastic protein , okay?
it's gonna stop the hemorrhaging .
okay .
is it gonna hurt?
yeah , it's gonna sting a little .
really?
fuck me !
aah !
i had a family once .
wife , two daughters .
then a drifter came calling one evvening .
a vvampire .
he toyed with 'em fiirst .
tried to make me decide which order they'd die in .
i'vve been doing this a long time .
since before you were born .
i don't want this life for you , abby .
hey , blade .
i got a question for you .
say we're successful .
say we wipe out all the vampires .
what then , huh?
you ever ask yourself that?
i mean , somehow ,
i ...
i don't picture you teaching karate at the local y.
he hates me , doesn't he?
yeah .
why do you wear that symbol?
old habits .
i was a good catholic schoolgirl ... ... once .
i was there when they crucified him .
he died for their sins .
not mine .
and what are your sins?
would you care to confess them?
take it off .
why?
i will make you a better one .
there's an old saying .
kill one man , you're a murderer ... ... kill a million , a king .
kill 'em all ... ... a god .
why do you do that?
because there's something bad inside of me .
this keeps it from getting out .
why can't you just be nice?
because the world isn't nice .
i found where the vampires are working .
biomedica enterprises .
they've been buying up all sorts of supplies .
check it out .
taq polymerase , bone marrow growth supplement , genetic sequencing enzymes .
you want a party favor?
lucky seven .
silver hollow points .
done .
you wanted to see me?
we've got trouble .
doing a little moonlighting , chief?
shit !
what are you doing here?
talk .
talk .
spill it !
you knowwhat we're doing .
what's inside?
aah !
now , what's behind door number one?
i can't tell you .
they ... they'll kill me .
kill you?
motherfucker , i'll kill you .
i'll just enjoy it better .
you know the routine .
lights .
god in heaven .
what is this place?
it's a blood farming facility .
vampires decided that hunting humans on a piecemeal basis was ... too inefficient .
why kill your prey when you can keep them alive?
under optimal conditions , a donor can generate anywhere from 50 to 100 pints of blood .
productive .
where do you get all these people?
they got processing centers in every major city .
at any given time , there's what , two , three million homeless wandering around america?
they just pull 'em in off the streets .
nobody cares about them .
we're doing this country a service , really .
vampire final solution .
are they aware?
do they feel anything?
they're in a chemical induced coma .
they're brain dead .
look at this .
this the future you want?
don't you think that they have a place for you in their future?
we don't have a choice !
they're going to win .
can't you see that?
he's come back !
there's nothing stopping them now .
there's me .
go !
you got 20 seconds .
twenty .
shutdown password ... what is it?
harvest .
put it in .
let's go .
where'd you go?
see?
i turned my back on you .
oh !
you win .
one more , one more .
now , nome king , having never tried to be good , was very bad indeed .
having decided to conquer the land of oz and to destroy the emerald city ...
this ain't no video game .
this ain't no video game .
come on , now .
dude , you're dead .
mom , the lights are weird .
what do you mean?
they're going on and off .
guys?
zoe , i want you to go , and i want you to hide , okay?
like we talked about .
go on .
zoe?
get out of here , zoe !
hide !
goddamn it , zoe !
goddamn it !
aah !
aah !
aah !
aah !
something's not right .
king !
zoe?
zoe .
zoe?
whistler .
use it .
use it .
use it .
aah !
back off , pooch .
jesus christ !
what the fuck? !
good dog .
what the fuck? !
his name's pac man .
we've been porting the vampire gene into other species ... experimenting .
you made a goddamn vampire pomeranian?
yeah .
precious , isn't he?
well , that depends who you ask , because clearly , this dog has a bigger dick than you .
and when the fuck did you see my dick , fuckface?
ow !
i was talking to her !
poor king .
you look so distraught !
give me that chair .
you're tasting a little bland , lover .
are you getting enough fatty acids in your diet?
have you tried lake trout?
mackerel?
how about you take a sugar frosted fuck off the end of my dick?
and how about everyone here not saying the word " dick " anymore?
it provokes my envy .
tell us about blade , king .
what's this weapon he's been planning?
i can tell you two things .
one ... your hairdo is ridiculous .
two , i ate a lot of garlic , and i just farted .
silent but deadly .
spit it out , you fucking fruitcake !
all right !
fuck !
i'll tell you about the weapon .
it's a new flavor crystal formula .
twice the chocolaty goodness , half the calories .
plus , it helps prevent tooth decay .
there .
you're brave , king .
i'll give you that .
but underneath all that swagger ,
i knowwhat you really fear .
what would hurt you more than anything else .
you don't want to go back to being one of us , do you?
i'm gonna bite you again , king .
and i'm gonna leave you here while you turn .
i'm going to watch you day after day as the thirst keeps building and building .
and then , when you can't stand it anymore ...
... l'm gonna bring the little girl in here ... ... for you to feed on .
would you like that , king?
would you enjoy taking her life?
nowwe're getting somewhere , my pet .
are you all right?
yeah .
i'll be fine .
don't let it turn inward .
ever since i can remember , i've had this ...
i've had this knife of sadness in my heart .
and as long as it's there , you know , i'm ...
i'm strong .
and i'm ...
i'm untouchable .
but the moment that i take it out ...
... l i'll just die .
he's one of ours .
my name is caulder .
i'll be your driver this evening .
sommerfield left you a video message .
if you're watching this , i'm already dead .
if zoe's alivve , i want you to promise me that you'll take care of her , okay?
i'vve been reading her the oz books evvery night .
we just started reading the emerald city of oz .
you know , the one with the nome king?
i think i'vve managed to cultivvate a workable strain of the daystar vvirus .
as a precaution , i transmitted the genetic sequence to caulder in case our main stock was destroyed .
in order for it to achievve maximum lethality , you're gonna need to interfuse it with drake's blood .
now , if it works , evvery vvampire in the immediate vvicinity should die almost instantly .
there's one other thing .
blade , you need to know that there's a chance the vvirus could destroy you , too .
because you're a hybrid ,
i ... i'm not sure if your immune system will be able to tolerate it .
i'm sorry .
we just didn't havve enough time to properly test it .
so , shall we take a look at the plague arrow?
i only had time to fabricate a small amount of daystar .
however , i was able to outfit it .
a compressed gas projectile ... ... that can be shot from one of the four barrel rifles or a bow .
either way , you must be sure that the shot counts .
you would simply not have enough for a second shot .
do you knowwho i am?
you're the nome king .
ah .
the nome king .
how sweet .
tell me , child , do you want to die?
i'm not afraid .
i'll go to heaven .
there is no heaven .
no god , no angels .
the only thing in your future is nothingness .
but what if you could change that?
what if you could remain a child forever?
wouldn't you like that?
wouldn't you accept that gift?
my friends are coming to kill you .
this blood
wake the night !
it's gonna wake the night
it's gonna wake the night
wake the night !
this blood
this blood
it's gonna wake the night
this blood
this blood
it's gonna wake the night !
this blood wake the night !
it's gonna wake the night
this blood wake the night !
wake the night !
this blood
this blood
it's gonna wake the night !
gonna be sorry you did that .
why?
nobody's coming for you , kingshit .
sure they are .
god ...
see , one of the things you fuckheads need to know about us nightstalkers is that when you join our club , you get all sorts of groovy little door prizes .
and one of them is this nifty little tracking node surgically implanted in your body .
bullshit .
yeah .
see , when one of us goes missing ... ... the others , they just dial up the satellite which is in space .
and then presto .
instant cavalry .
you like that , huh?
go fuck your sister .
okay , king .
where is this tracking node of yours?
it's in my left ass check .
fine .
it's in my right ass cheek .
okay , i'm ... okay , seriously , now .
it's in the meat of my butt , just below the hello kitty tattoo .
seriously , just pull down my tighty whities and see for yourself .
enough !
it's not funny anymore !
no , it's not , you horse humping bitch !
but it will be a few seconds from now .
see , that tickle that you're feeling in the back of your throat right now ... ... that's atomized colloidal silver .
it's being pumped through the building's air conditioning system , you cock juggling thundercunt !
which means the fat lady should be singing right about now !
this is awkward .
do you have a cell phone?
um ... a little help here .
are you all right?
yeah .
where's zoe?
drake's got her .
okay .
thank you .
i brought your toys .
try to keep up .
aah !
abby !
hey .
you okay?
okay .
let's get you out of here .
watch out !
fuck me .
oh , fuck me sideways !
oh , yeah .
he's a cute little guy , aren't ya?
good little puppies .
yeah , you're gonna stay .
you stay .
oh .
there's a pretty smile .
yeah .
i'm going to , uh ...
hey , dickface .
you seen my dog?
have you tried the lobby?
thank you .
fuck ...
come on , king . ... this .
blade .
ready to die?
i was born ready , motherfucker .
motherfucker .
i like that .
aah !
aah !
aah !
aah !
you broke my arm !
aah !
are you ready to die , motherfucker?
give it up .
come on .
give it up , king .
give it up .
give it up .
give it up .
hang in there , kitten .
i'll get help .
funny , isn't it?
all this time , my people were trying to create a new kind of vampire , when one already exists .
i don't need to survive .
the future of our race rests with you .
you fought with honor .
i respect that .
allow me a parting gift .
but remember this .
sooner or later , the thirst always wins .
and blade?
the vvirus didn't kill him .
because he was a hybrid , his heart nevver stopped beating .
it simply slowed down .
and so he slept , waiting for the moment when he could walk the earth again .
yo , yo
it's the feast of the blood
unleash the beast within
i walk around with the strength of a hundred men
you best run before i count to ten
blood dripping from my canine like a fountain pen
the shape shifting mirror image flash phototype
the everlasting vision , the red battle type
try to use my name , that's fatal
tried to claim my fame , but that's fatal
about to raise the pain , that's fatal
bite through your jugular vein , that's fatal
walk with me , come on , walk with me
come on , walk with me , come on , walk with me
come on , walk with me , come on , walk with me
come on , walk with me , walk with me
i strike back with a vengeance , the father , your descendants
and i can't be deflected by your silver cross pendants
bloody holy water , you made the false images
what's waiting for the sickle?
you're like the nemesis
sting like the scorpion , strike with the force again
my blood in those who revitalize the corpse i'm in
and the last thing , they said the dead would walk again
the blind , deaf and the dumb will talk again
try to use my name , that's fatal
trying to claim my fame , that's fatal
about to raise the pain , that's fatal
bite through your jugular vein , that's fatal
you don't even know me
you can't even see me
friendlier than daylight
now i'm back , now i'm back again
don't be scared , baby
can't you see i'm thirsty?
friends of the daylight
let me drink , let me drink , my friend
don't be scared , baby
don't be afraid
friends of the daylight
and i'm back , and i'm back again
never going nowhere
you can't run from me
day or night , baby
can i drink , can i drink again?
yeah
yeah
can we drink , can we drink , my friend?
don't be scared , baby
don't be scared , baby
can't you see i'm thirsty?
and i'm back , and i'm back again
first things first , man , you can't fight the thirst
you can't call the doctor , you can't call the nurse
you got that louis logo on the side of your purse
and those tight minis about to make me burst
i can't think , let me sink into your jugular
come have a drink with the thirsty love guzzler
from the dark side , baby , don't be afraid
you can't fight the thirst nor escape the plague
i've been scopin 'ya hoping you'd be open to
take a sip of the potion 'cause it's overdue
it's not your ordinary , it's a special brew
in the heat of the night , i will rescue you
never going nowhere
you can't run from me
day or night , baby
can i drink , can i drink again?
yeah
yeah
can we drink , can we drink , my friend?
don't be scared , baby
don't be scared , baby
can't you see i'm thirsty?
and i'm back , and i'm back again
allow me a parting gift .
but remember this .
sooner or later , the thirst will always win .
and i'm back , and i'm back again
