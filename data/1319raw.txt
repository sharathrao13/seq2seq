whoa , what's your problem?
have some of this stuff .
i didn't get a lot of sleep last night , john .
i'm fried .
soft mattress?
yeah , that could've been it .
it could have been the soft mattress .
or , it could've been the midnight rape ... or the nude , gay art show that took place in my room ... one of those probably added to the lack of sleep ...
try one of these scones , you're gonna love 'em .
i'm a little traumatized to have a scone .
let's move .
will you slow down for a second?
the whole eyedrop thing backfired .
okay?
it didn't work .
she had to leave me and go attend to him .
why are you looking at me like that?
you're falling for this broad .
no !
i just met her .
exactly .
i'm gonna go .
you can't go .
watch me .
watch me take this on down the road .
if you leave , gloria is gonna freak out and throw a shit fit , and it's gonna go into crisis lockdown mode here at the house .
i don't give a baker's fuck !
i just had my own sock duct taped into my mouth last night !
whoa , what?
yeah , the sock that i wore around all day , playin 'football in , pouring sweat in , was shoved into my mouth , and there was duct tape over it !
well , let's talk about it .
i'm a good listener .
i'm not in a place to discuss what happened .
okay?
i felt like jodie foster in " the accused " last night .
i'm gonna go home , see dr. finkelstein and i'm gonna tell him ... we got a whole new bag of issues , we can forget about mom for a while .
i'm gonna go .
suit yourself .
rule # 1 .
never leave a fellow crasher behind .
i can't believe how selfish you are .
i need you .
a friend in need is a pest .
i'll stick it out with you because you're desperate .
i need the big guy .
i'm gonna try to give you a little bit more time , because somebody can't close .
fair enough .
but if you want my help , you gotta listen .
stop being a pussy .
make a move .
number three ... you know it .
could you pop the syrup for me?
just as a top off?
here's what's gonna happen , tonto .
kimosabe's gonna have some flavor ,
i'm gonna choose not to eat with you .
we're not gonna eat together?
no .
i like to recharge my batteries , and shut down the engines , and get myself back to neutral .
when the meal's over with , i will talk to you .
i don't want to get into what happened last night ,
'cause it's only gonna make me mad .
let's get through today ,
let's keep our eye on the prize , let's focus ,
and let's close some ass .
noted .
can i tell you something without you getting angry?
i love you .
yeah , you , big guy .
i love you too .
hello .
trapster , it's sack .
sackmaster !
how was the wedding?
oh , it was boring , you know , but the bachelor party , of course , rocked .
we got heidi a couple of those fucking sluts from the environmental group , remember them?
no way !
did you tap that again?
once at my place , then once back in the cab .
damn !
sluts !
oh , how's claire?
still trying to figure out what she's doing with her life?
claire?
she's , you know , whatever , i don't know .
she's saving the world one maladjusted kid at a time .
but that'll all change when we're married ,
'cause i want a wife .
i don't want a fucking martyr , right?
i hear that , my friend .
hey , man , listen , i i i i got ... do you remember that private detective we used to set up that fucking shearson lehman prick?
the big sleazy , tommy gufano .
he's a wop genius .
yes .
i need you to get some dirt on these two guys
john and jeremy ryan .
they're brothers from new hampshire .
they got some sort of n. p. o. called " holy shirts & pants .
i will check into them .
excellent , bro .
you da man !
take it easy .
where's sack?
oh , he's ... he's still not feeling very well .
well then , " the woodwind " takes off without him .
john my boy .
yes?
we're tacking back round .
do me a favor , ease the sheets , swing the jib starboard .
okay , let me ...
okay .
one minute .
hi .
how's it going?
hi .
oh , just swinging the jib here for your dad .
starboard .
trying to get it over here and crease the sheet .
um , but starboard's this way .
oh , that's right .
what am i ...
yeah .
what am i thinking?
i'll help .
okay .
hang on , hang on .
watch the jib boom .
oh .
all right , push it .
push it this way .
oh , yeah .
yeah , this is better .
come on , use some muscle .
there we go .
all right , that's good .
done .
done .
you know , i'm used to sailing down under with the kiwis , so everything is backwards .
even the toilets ... when you flush them , the water spins the opposite way .
really freaks you out the first time you see it .
john my boy , come on up here .
man " the woodwind " for a while .
on my way .
hey , your dad was telling me about a great beach near here that maybe we could check out if you have any interest when we get back .
yeah .
great .
okay , it can get confusing up here .
if you have a problem , just give me a call .
thank you .
thanks .
now how would one get to this sook's bend?
actually , it would be a really nice bike ride .
everything's ready for the quail hunt !
for the quail hunt?
yeah .
it's a ... it's a cleary family tradition .
well , i think you might have to deal me out on this ,
'cause we were gonna ...
nonsense , i insist .
john , you gotta go !
you're gonna love it !
you're gonna love it !
sack , honey , um , you're a little bit sick for hunting .
oh , no , i'm great !
honey , i'm great !
oh , i'm going !
right?
right?
okay .
you're going .
so , i guess i'll see you later .
see you later .
just take it easy , okay?
okay .
okay .
mr. environmental is also a a hunter .
it's kind of an interesting combination .
i hunt quail , jeremy !
they're overpopulated in this region and they're decimating the grub worm population .
you got a fucking problem with that? !
not nearly as much as i do with the , uh , attire that you have on , or just your general point of view towards everybody .
but let's go kill some birds .
i'm psyched .
have you even shot one of these things before?
the whole 17 years we've known each other ,
i've been sneaking off to go on little hunting trips around the world .
no , i don't even know what the fuck a quail is !
i feel totally ridiculous .
like why do i have to be in camouflage?
so the big bad quail doesn't see me?
i know .
it's like , why can't we hunt something cool
like a hawk , or an eagle , or something with some talons?
that'd be awesome .
you mean , something like big game even like a gorilla ...
yeah .
gorilla !
or rhinoceros ...
rhino !
or a fucking human being?
that'll get you jacked up .
that's a little heavy .
i mean , like ... you're hunting a human being right now , the most dangerous game .
like a worthy adversary .
not a human being that's armed ...
oh , if he wasn't armed . ... but a clever ... a clever human being
who knows the jungle , or the woods .
or like a bad guy .
there's something not right about these guys .
what do you mean?
i mean , it's time to send them home .
sack , don't do anything crazy .
just relax , i'm just gonna scare them a little bit .
all right .
to the right !
argh !
oo ooh !
ooh .
they got me !
oh , shit .
they got me !
oh , shit .
ow !
jesus !
you okay , buddy?
oh , don't " okay , buddy " me .
look , we just came by to say we're gonna take a little bike ride and then we're gonna come back and check up on you .
and take care of him , okay?
i want you to get my little angel up and running .
hang in there .
i hope you flip your bike over and knock your two front teeth out , you selfish son of a bitch !
you leave me in the trenches taking grenades , john !

randolph .
shh .
i'm watching my stories , man .
is that what you get paid to do?
it's exactly what i get paid to do .
look , i want to know where claire is .
she took a bike ride down to the beach .
with who?
with that fellow from the wedding that everyone seems to be so fond of .
so you're a venture capitalist?
what does that mean?
oh , it's really not that interesting , actually .
you don't sound very enthused .
oh , no , it's just ... you know , things started happening and you go down a road and you think it's just for a little while .
and then you get caught up in it and you're kind of into it and just don't even have time to really ask questions about it .
and before you know it you're living a life that you didn't set out to , or that you intended to .
do you know what i mean?
yes , i do .
i think that there's some great things that i'd like to do , that that maybe i'm capable of , hopefully .
oh , yeah?
like what?
i don't know .
we'll see .
i'm still young .
well ... you're not that young .
i'm sorry .
give me your hands .
i know this game .
okay .
i'm not gonna bite you .
do you want it full speed or half speed?
full .
you're never gonna hit me , i don't think .
i'm pretty quick .
what?
let me get settled before you go .
you didn't approve of that?
no , because you're supposed to ...
you gotta wait until i put them back !
come on !
so what about you ... with sack?
is that a good thing?
yes , i think it's a ... good thing .
you don't sound very enthused .
i am .
i ... well , i mean , i think i am , i ...
i'm ...
okay .
i g ... you know , we've just been talking so much about the future lately and , uh ...
i mean , i always assumed that we would get married .
but , uh ...
i'm scared .
i am .
but i think that that's how everyone feels before they're about to get married .
i mean , don't you think?
yeah , no .
don't answer that .
that's my rationalization and i'm sticking to it .
fair enough .
and i don't mean to pry .
yes you do .
well , however it works out , i hope you ... uh , i hope you realize that you deserve somebody great .
i have an announcement .
i know that we said we were gonna wait , but , uh , given the spirit of this weekend well ...
claire , come on .
come on .
come on come on , it's okay .
come on !
come on .
claire and i are getting married .
good , sack .
that's wonderful !
wonderful .
wonderful !
way to go , man !
way to go !
claire bear , you never told me !
two of the great american families .
claire , you took us all by surprise !
yeah .
yeah .
you're good !
you're good !
can can you just give me one minute?
yeah !
okay .
great .
congratulations , young man !
welcome to the family !
this is wonderful !
look , kid , i'm sorry .
you win some , you lose some , right?
let's go home .
no , i'm not ...
i can't ...
i can't do that .
what are you talking about?
look , i i think i'm in love with her .
yeah , i i i think ...
i think that you're nuts .
that's what i think .
i'm gonna tell her the truth .
jesus christ !
hey .
hey !
how are you !
okay , listen , gloria , you know that i think that you're an amazing person , a really amazing person , but i feel like i have to be upfront with you .
i i i really don't see this relationship going further than this weekend .
but i love you !
yeah , i think you'll learn as time goes on that there's a difference between infatuation and love , you know?
obviously , you're gonna have strong feelings for me because you lost your virginity to me ,
but that doesn't mean ...
oh , i wasn't a virgin .
what?
i wasn't a virgin .
far from it .
i just thought that that's what guys wanted to hear .
come on .
jeremy !
wow !
hello , son .
you okay?
not now , father , please .
no offense to you ,
i think we might be on different wavelengths .
i think you'd just be spinning your wheels with me , but , uh , have a little of the sacrament here .
no one likes to drink alone .
we'll set you up .
there you go , get your hands on it .
take it while it's hot .
take it while it's hot .
i'm gonna pour till it's on the tray .
here it is .
can i ask you a question , father?
do you ever get horny?
i'm sure you do .
i just ... in your position you're not ... right?
isn't that you're not allowed to ... sleep with anybody , right?
does that get tough sometimes?
you ever pull on yourself , or ...
no .
everything works?
do you get swelled up still?
yeah , of course .
well , what do you do?
you pray .
yeah , i pray , too , you know what i mean?
i mean , i believed that she was a virgin .
it hurts to be lied to like that .
it's a horrible feeling to feel that way .
but i , you know , was looking to take advantage of something , too .
so could i really feel that bad?
it's not like i was who i was .
you know what i'm saying?
so , fair play .
and let's be honest with each other here , okay?
let's put all the cards on the table .
she's fit for a straitjacket .
this broad's fucked three ways towards the weekend .
and you wanna know what?
i dig it !
it turns me on !
yeah !
it turns me on !
because you wanna know what the kicker is , father?
maybe i'm a little fucking crazy !
that's right !
maybe jeremy's a little nuts .
maybe there's something about me that i'm a little cuckoo .
i know it's a surprise .
i know it's not on the surface .
i mean , i had an imaginary friend when i was a kid .
his name was shilo !
we used to play checkers with each other every day , and bless his heart , shilo'd always let me win !
and that ain't normal !
there's something odd in that , but maybe that's what it takes to make you feel
like you're connected with somebody .
i don't know !
but i know when that redhead starts getting kooky that something about me feels alive inside !
i'm diggin 'talkin 'with ya .
you're a really enlightened cat and i like that about ya .
i think you're a special special man .
okay , come in for the real thing .
mmm?
mmm?
get in here for the real thing .
i love ya .
you're a sweet man .
oh , dear god .
you can't marry this guy .
why?
because i've fallen for you .
oh , good news travels fast .
excuse me .
sorry , thanks .
thanks .
trapster , talk to me .
no shit .
and do you maybe feel the same way?
maybe .
maybe .
that's all i needed to know .
but this is crazy , because i don't know any ...
why?
i don't know anything about you !
what do you mean?
you do investments in new hampshire and you have a crazy brother ...
well , actually , i need to talk to you about that .
it's not a big deal , but maybe you want to sit back on the swing .
run !
johnny !
she's trying to kill me !
grandma !
whoa whoa !
get the gun from her !
put the gun down !
mother , stop !
this is the real world , lady !
you can't just go shooting people on a whim !
what did you do?
i told you that in confidence !
that was a confession !
what are you talking about?
why don't you tell her , john?
i don't know what's going on .
you don't know?
i'm playing catch up , too .
i don't ...
sack , what are you doing? !
remembering yet?
you remember yet?
are you okay?
they're not who they say they are , claire .
those aren't even their real names .
what? !
no , everything he told you is a lie .
i i don't understand what you're saying .
claire , they crash weddings .
they crash weddings so that they can sleep with girls .
everything that they have told us is a complete fabrication .
no , you're joking .
all of it is a lie .
don't you fucking get up .
sack , will you just stop? !
okay okay .
is that true?
no , well , no , it's ... not entirely .
no , it's a yes or no question .
i know , but it's complicated .
yes or no?
yes or no?
yes ... with shades of grey .
oh .
i'm not perfect , but who are we kidding?
neither are you .
and you wanna know what?
i dig it !
jeremy tried to seduce me !
you did?
i want my painting back .
the painting was a gift , todd .
i'm taking it with me .
you had me going , son .
i thought it was something special .
there's a ferry leaving in 10 minutes .
i suggest you be on it .
come on , let's go .
i want you .
i love you .
he made a fool out of you , claire .
come on , let's go .
sweetheart .
now bunch those panties up into a little ball .
put that little ball right in your mouth .
oh , that's good .
hang up the phone .
okay , and i will definitely call you back later then .
come on , wrap it up .
talk to you soon .
thank you , larry .
what the fuck?
you can't knock anymore?
i know how i can get to her .
what?
i know how i can get to claire .
oh , john , you gotta drop this thing .
i'm ...
i can't do this anymore with you , okay?
it's been several months , and you haven't heard anything from her .
she hasn't returned your phone calls , she's never responded to one of your letters ,
she didn't respond to the candygram .
right .
god knows what happened to the little kitten that you got her .
because she didn't keep it and i know you're not raising that goddamn thing .
okay .
i think it's very obvious at this juncture that she just flat out does not wanna see you .
i disagree .
now look , they're having the engagement party for her tonight at the beach club .
we're going at 7 : 30 .
i'm not g ...
john , i can't ...
okay okay , listen to me , tasmanian devil .
listen to me .
i can't go .
why?
'cause i can't go , because i have a schedule .
because i have ...
what is your deal?
what is your problem?

you're supposed to move your hands .
you're not getting enough attention?
love doesn't exist !

and i'm not picking on love ,
'cause i don't think friendship exists either .
hey !
yeah !
are you okay?
get up , buddy .
move it on .
gloria , i've been doing a lot of soul searching lately , and i i think that i'm ready to take , um , this relationship , our relationship to the next level .
to what the next level of the ... of the ... of the relationship would be .
jeremy !
is that good?
i'm so ready to take it to the next level too .
do you want to watch me with a girl?
what about those brazilian twins we met at the ballgame?
i i was ...
i was ...
i was thinking more along the lines of an ... of an ... of an engagement .
but that sounds terrific .
that sounds ... that sounds unbelievable .
the brazilian girls were very nice .
they seemed like ...
oh , jeremy , i do !
i love you .
i love you .
i i can't believe that they're getting married .
i mean don't you you think that's really soon?
well , you know gloria .
she's impetuous .
has to have what she wants when she wants it .
well , we had to give her a sweet 16 on her 13th birthday .
you remember that .
yeah , i remember , but this is ...
dad , this is marriage !
when you know what you want , you know what you want .
so ... which of these do you like?
um ... well , i could ...
i could go with the tall tapered arrangement with , uh , tulips and freesias and orchids , or i could go with a votive of roses and lilies , i don't know .
claire bear .
yeah?
what's wrong?
look ...
we have no way of knowing what lays ahead for us in the future .
all we can do is use the information at hand to make the best decision possible .
it's gonna be fine .
your whole life is gonna be fine .
yeah .
happy birthday .
can't let a little pissing and moaning break tradition .
oh right , that's today .
i see you've been getting into a little light reading .

good to see you .

i'm hanging by a thread .

i knew you'd come ...

i never know what she's doing back there .
just living the dream . " where did you get that girl?
she's hot !
i got her yesterday .
yesterday?
yeah .
i rode my bike over to a cemetery nearby .
her boyfriend just died .
you met her at a funeral?
yeah .
the dude died in a hang gliding accident .
what an idiot !
oh , i'm hang gliding !
honey , take a good picture ...
i'm dead !
what a freak !
you met her at a funeral .
yeah , i'll throw in a wedding every now and then , but funerals are insane !
the chicks are so horny , it's not even fair .
it's like fishing with dynamite .
horny?
yeah , crazy horny .
i just ... at a funeral? !
grief is nature's most powerful aphrodisiac .
huh .
look it up .
i didn't know that .
that's what i've learned .
ma , the meatloaf !
fuck !
saturday ...
i got one saturday .
you're coming with !
chaz , i'm ...
i'm sorry , i don't ...
i'm not judging you , 'cause i think you're an innovator , but ... there's no way i'm ready for that .
a time to plant , and a time to pluck up that which is planted ;
a time to kill and a time to heal ;
a time to break down and a time to build up ;
a time to weep and a time to laugh ;
a time to cast away stones ...
so senseless .
damn you , roger .
roger !
oh !
damn you , roger !
damn it !
damn you !
i'm in pain .
i'll try to fight it .
try to fight it .
i don't know about you people , but i'm in pain .
i know that there is no good in them for man to rejoice and to do good in his life ... for that which befalleth the sons of men , befalleth beasts .
even one thing befalleth , as the one dieth , so dieth the other .
yea , they all have one breath , so that a man hath no preeminence above the beast .
while each man thinks he knows love ,
love , we have learned , is a mystery .
that's what makes today so special .
we witness two people choosing to marry ones they truly love .
whoa whoa , hey !
hey hey !
he's the best man .
yeah .
thank you .
i don't believe this .
hat in hand .
i'm sorry i'm late .
i'm glad you're here .
and and i'm sorry i called you white trash .
i didn't ...
john , apology accepted .
and i'm sorry i called you a hillbilly ,
i don't even know what that meant .
john , it's okay .
do you mind if i get married now?
no , go ahead .
hi , todd .
although we may choose whom we marry ,
we don't always choose ...
psst .
claire , i'm not here to bother you ,
i just came to be his best man .
don't worry about me .
pretend i'm not here .
okay .
i'm not a nut .
you look really pretty , by the way .
that's all i'm gonna say .
i can't stop thinking about you .
it's all i think about and i don't know what to do .
ahem .
i'm sorry .
that's what makes today so special ...
god , i miss you .
okay , excuse me , i'm sorry .
claire , hold on a second .
claire , claire !
claire , will you wait just a second?
all i wanted was a second alone so i could try to explain things .
but i've never gotten that chance .
maybe i don't deserve it .
so here goes .
for longer than i care to remember , my business has been crashing weddings .
i crashed weddings to meet girls .
business was good .
i met a lot of girls .
and it was childish , it was juvenile ...
and pathetic .
yeah , that's probably the best word to describe it .
but you know what?
it also led me to you .
so it's hard for me to completely regret it .
and that person that you met back at your folks 'place ... that was really me .
maybe not my name ...
i'm john beckwith by the way ... or my job , but the feelings we felt the jokes , the stupid laughs ... that was all me .
i've changed .
i've realized something .
i crashed a funeral earlier , and i ...
oh , jesus .
it wasn't my idea .
i was basically dragged to it .
i went with chaz , who you forgot to tell me is totally insane .
he also might be a genius because it actually does work .
he's cleaning up .
john .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry , i'm sorry .
that's neither here nor there .
and i see this widow and she's a wreck .
she's just lost the person she loves the most in this world .
and i realized we're all gonna lose the people we love .
that's the way it is .
but not me , not right now .
because the person i love the most is standing right here , and i'm not ready to lose you yet .
claire , i'm not standing here asking you to marry me .
i'm just asking you ... not to marry him .
and maybe take a walk .
take a chance .
wow !
wow !
this congregation really doesn't care about how depressing your life is , john , okay?
claire , baby , could you just ... could you go back up on the altar so we can have a wedding?
i'm sorry .
i am .
what?
i can't marry you .
secretary ... your daughter's a little ...
sack , i've always liked you ... so i put up with your stories about scallops and otters , and it's all good because you seemed to make her happy and that's what matters to me most .
but this is her decision .
huh .
i stand by my daughter .
you don't know shit .
claire , go back up on the altar .
no .
claire !
claire , get up on that altar right now .
stop it .
claire , get your fucking ass
on that altar right now !
wow , getting a nice preview or what marriage is gonna be like with ike turner here .
sack !
oh god , here it goes .
share that with the dalai lama , jackass .
i think i had him .
i know you did .
just go kiss the broad .
would it be a total clich if i kissed you right now?
yes .
just wonderful .
so damn beautiful !
with every death there comes rebirth .
it's the circle of life .
we're gonna be all right .
hey .
uh uh uh .
hey .
uh uh !
so , what's next?
i'm starving .
fujimora wedding , 3 : 00 p. m.
hey hey .
i'm just throwing it out .
i'm just saying , just ...
they would have great tempura .
we don't even have a back story , i just ...
no , forget it , forget it .
i'm talking out loud .
we're a folk singing group
from salt lake city !
yeah !
yes we are .
# in the morning don't say you love me #
# 'cause i'll only kick you out of the door #
# stay with me ... #
# measure me in metered lines #
# and one decisive stare #
# the time it takes #
# to get from here to there #
# my ribs that show through t shirts #
# and these shoes i got for free #
# i'm unconsoled #
# i'm lonely #
# i am so much better #
# than i used to be #
# and i'm leaning #
# on this broken fence #
# between past and present tense #
# and i'm losing #
# all those stupid games #
# that i swore #
# i'd never play #
# but it almost feels okay #
# circumnavigate this body #
# of wonder #
# and uncertainty #
# armed with every precious failure #
# and amateur cartography #
# i'm breathing deep before #
# i spread those maps out #
# on my bedroom floor #
# and i'm leaning #
# on this broken fence #
# between past and present tense #
# and i'm losing #
# all those stupid games #
# that i swore #
# i'd never play #
# but it feels okay #
# and i'm leaving #
# with goodbye #
# and i'm losing #
# but i'll try #
# with the last ways left #
# to remember sing #
# my imperfect offering . #
# sailing on this boat away tonight #
# thinking i might drown if the waves aren't right #
# wind pushing me from side to side #
# and i'm thinking #
# of what i had #
# and my sweetheart #
# and my sweetheart #
# and if i never see you #
# again #
# i just want you to know #
# what i think #
# sunday took me out for a walk in the park #
# and as the dark ran round , the track lights lit up #
# people running round in their shorts in the rain #
# again #
# and again #
# thinking that you're my sweetheart #
# you're my sweetheart #
# i can hardly see the road #
# but i'm gonna try #
# yeah , i'm gonna try #
# 'cause you're my sweetheart #
# you're my sweetheart #
# and if i never see you #
# again #
# i just want you to know #
# what i think #
# if you've got to run #
# yeah , i'll be there #
# if you've got to run . #
# now kiri waits it out #
# but she's only young enough for some things #
# healing the sick and dumb #
# and low on the radar , the smoking gun #
# we're moving fast enough to function #
# fast enough to function #
# maybe it's me #
# 'cause i seem to think in twos and threes #
# you find your open door #
# and through the skids i sail #
# and keep that love #
# underground #
# ooh , ooh ooh ooh #
# ooh ooh ooh #
# ooh ooh #
# ooh , ooh ooh ooh #
# ooh ooh ooh #
# ooh ooh #
# ooh , ooh ooh ooh #
# ooh ooh ooh #
# ooh ooh #
