cyrano warned him to quit the stage .

he is .
mr. cyrano will not come?
i'm betting on it .

the lady's not coming today .
the bottle calls , i'm on my way .
i'm a stranger in paris .

madeleine robin or roxanne .

an orphan and cousin to the notorious cyrano .
a strawberry mouth in peach flesh .
so fresh , she'd give one cardiac rheumatism .
who's that?
tell me , i scared .
that's the comte de guiche .
her lover?
he wants to be .
but one thing stands in his way .
what thing?
he's married to richelieu's niece .
so he wants to see her married to that grim monsieur .
the viscount valvert , so indulgent .
roxane says no but de guiche is potent .
he tortures the poor bourgeoise .
i wrote a poem showing what an evil swine he is .
he must hate me for it .
the ending was cruel .
you're going?

his life nears its end .
the victim of his song sends 100 men to do him wrong .
a hundred?
against one .
one poor poet .

at the porte de nesles .
no cyrano .
i lose my bet .
so much the better .
montfleury !
montfleury !
happy he ... who far from court and city ... ah , how good ... breathes the essence of the vernal wood
and who , when the breeze sings melodies

cyrano !
i win !
king of fools ... off the stage !
moosieur ...

gentlemen , quiet please or my cane will take its ease .
montfleury !

monsieur ...
lug your guts away , salami , or stay ... and i'll remove you slice by slice .
in insulting me you insult the tragic muse .
montfleury !
montfleury !

consider my scabbard , pray .
she loves my sword , begs him stay .
leave the stage !
does anyone have anything to say?
clorise !
play on !
baro's play !
sing the again and there'll be a massacre !
you're no samson !
fall silent !
i hereby challenge you all .
i'll take names .
step forward young heroes , each in turn .
come along ...
who wishes to head the list?
you , sir?
no?
you?
no?
i'll give the first a funeral as his due .
raise your right hand all who wish to die .
my naked blade offends your eye?
no names?
no hands?
good .
let me speak then .
i wish to see theatre cured ... of this inflammation .
here's the lancet !
my lords ... ladies and gentlemen !
flock of muttonheads !
bravo !
good !
bravo !
let's have no bravos .
the famed thespian whose paunch you love so much felt sick .
he had to leave .
bring him back .
no !
yes !
what's your reason , sir?
why show such enmity to montfleury?
two reasons , one will suffice .
firstly , he's a terrible mouther grunter , grimacer and posturer who weighs down heavy on his lines .
secondly , well that's my secret
you deprive us without a scruple of a great play !
old mule !
the work is worth less than nought .
i silenced it without a thought .
lord in heaven !
our baro !
what of the money to pay back?
bellerose , those are wise words .
i do not wish to see thespis 'robe full of tatters .
take this and go .
you're mad !
that famous actor has the duc de candale as protector .
do you have a patron?
no patron?
no name to protect you?
i said no twice .
must it be a third?
my patronness here keeps her word .
turn and walk !
but ...
why are you looking at my nose?
does it disgust you?
not at all .
is it soft and dangling?
i did not look at it .
and why did you not look at it?
sickened you , did it?
is the colour all wrong?
is it obscene?
not at all .
why then do y ou criticize?
do you find it too large in size?
it's terribly small , minuscule .
what was that?
is that an insult?
my nose is small , eh
oh , god !
my nose , sir , is enormous !
cretinous moron a man ought to be proud proud of such an appendix .
a great nose may be an index of a great soul kind , endowed with liberality and courage ...
like mine , you rat brained dunce unlike yours , all rancid porridge .
it would be grotesque to fist your wretched mug ... so lacking as it is ... in pride , genius the lyrical and picturesque in spark , spunk , in brief : in nose .
so take a boot instead to your backside
help !
call the guard !
a warning ... to you who find my coutenance a source of sport .
be you noble , my swift response is different altogether .
i strike with steel ... and not leather !
he's a bit of a bore .
a braggart .
who shall it be , gentlemen?
nobody?
wait , you can leave it to me .
you ...
that thing of yours ... is ... very big .
very .
that's all?
yes .
nothing more?
there are fifty score varieties of comment .
nay , more .
just change the tone .
a nose in such a state i'd amputate .
it must dip in your cup you need a crane to hoist it up .
a rock , a bluff , a cape !
no , a peninsula in size and shape !
what is that oblong?
a writing desk or am i wrong?
are you food of birds?
you provide a gothic perch for them ... " " to rest their feet .
a smoker?
i suppose ...
the fumes gush out from that nose like a chimney on fire .
it will drag you in the mire head first with its weight .
i'll have an umbrella made to give it some summer shade .
the beast of aristophanes the hippocampocamalelephunt ... " " had flesh and bone like that up front
it bleeds like the red sea .
what a sign for a perfumery .
ah , triton rising from the waters .
how much to view the monument?
train it on the cavalry !
put that in a lottery for noses and it'll be first prize .
o that this too too ... " " solid nose would melt .
that is what you could have said or had an ounce of wit in your head .
s. o. t.
had you the wit required ... to serve me before the crowd a dish of words ... so proud ... not a phrase would have passed your lips .
for although the words may fit i'd never let you get away with it .
valvert , leave him !
arrogant , base nonentity without even a pair of gloves
let alone the ribbons and lace a noble loves !
my elegance is interior .
i do not go out feeling inferior from an insult ... which on the exterior leaves its mark of warning in libel and scruples in mourning .
i step out ... smelling of scrubbed liberty and polished independance .
come see !
let him be !
about gloves , you have me there .
i had one left over from a pair , which a was very attached to .
i left it planted on someone's cheek .
cad , villain , clod ... flatfooted fool !
and i'm cyrano savinien hercule de bergerac .
buffoon !
what is it now?
i must ... relieve these cramps .
it's lack of exercise .
are you all right?
my sword has gone to sleep .
so be it !
with what joy ... she wakens to that sound .
poet , eh?
yes , a poet .
even when rattling ironmongery
i'll compose a ballade extempore .
a ballade?
i'll hit you on the final line .
no !
no?
ballade of a fencing bout ...
between de bergerac and a foppish lout .
what is that doggerel?
it's the title .
silence !
quiet !
wait .
let me choose my rhymes .
good .
ready .
0 bare my head from crown to nape and slowly ... abandon my cape
then finally i strip my steel .
a thoroughbred ... from head to heel .
disdainful of the rein or bit .
i pull a lyric wheel but at the poem's end ...
i hit !
come , be burst ... you purple grape .
come and lose your peel .
show , you ribboned ape the fat your folderols conceal .
a pretty peal .
is that a fly?
your blood will congeal .
for , when the poem ends , i hit .
i need a rhyme to hole the shape .
i'm going to wind the reel .
my rod is ready to rape .
the sharp tooth awaits its meal .
not yet .
i stop a bit ... awaiting the deal .
the poem ends and i hit .
envoy !
prince , pray to god and kneel .
will you quit?
i cut , parry ... off you reel !
the poem ended ... and i hit !
where will your life lead you?
you've so many enemies .
wonderful .
you gave your gold away .
a year's pay .
all spent on one glorious day .
how will you live now?
i don't know .
a stupid action .
but a glorious gesture .
what rules the life you lead?
i forced myself to play many parts .
that was my way .
and now?
i'll take the simplest excel in everything , be the best .
so be it .
now tell me why you hate montfleury so much .
that paunch !
one night i saw him touch a lady with his eyes .
like a slug slithering over a rose .
what?
how can that be?
the one i loved .
the one i love .
you never said anything before .
whom i love?
just think a moment .
i can never be loved even by the ugliest .
my nose preceeds me by fifteen minutes .
whom do i love?
it should be clear .
i love the prettiest far and near .
the prettiest?
the finest , the wittiest , the seetest , the wiset .
it's clear now .
diaphanously .
your cousin?
yes .
roxane .
wonderful !
tell her you love her !
tonight you're with glory covered .
look and tell me what exuberance i have with this protuberance .
i'm under no illusion .
true sometimes , bemused by the night
i see far off in the silver light a lady on the arm of her knight .
i dream of walking out in the silver glow with a lady so .
i get carried away .
i pray .
i forget all then see my shadow on the wall .
my friend ...
my friend ... why should fate allot such ugliness , such loneliness?
you cry?
oh no , that would be intolerable .
a tear on this nose , horrible !
i saw roxane's face tonight .
for your duel it was ghostly white .
your skill and courage ravished her .
now dare to speak .
so she can laugh at me?
there's nothing i fear more .
do they want you?
her maid !
sir , your cousin wishes to know if you can meet in private tomorrow .
she has things to say .
to me?
oh , my god .
after mass , where could you talk?
where?
i ... er ... oh , my god .
quickly please .
patience !
where?
at ragueneau's ... the pastrycook .
where?
in ... oh , my god ... in the rue saint honore .
she'll be there .
you be there .
at seven
i'll be there .
she wants to see me !
so goodbye to sorrow?
it means i exist for her .
are you calm?
calm?
i'm gripped by lightning and thunder !
i need an army to tear asunder !
so much power , so much defiance take off the dwarfs and bring on the giants !
what?
we're trying to sleep !
less noise !
grumblers , eh?
why do they complain?
ligniere !
cyrano !
what's wrong?
he's afraid to go home .
fancy that !
why>
a warning ... a hundred men ...
because of a song i wrote ...
going to get me when
i go through the porte de nesles .
it's no my way .
i'm hiding here .
they've let me stay .
a hundred?
you'll sleep at home .
come on .
follow and witness my deeds .
a hundred men?
that's what my force needs .
why do they mount this attack?
he's a friend of de bergerac !
silence the god within you , ragueneau .
the oven beckons .
well , it must be so .
your rolls are like an ill tuned fiddle
place the caesura right in the middle .
your crusty house needs a roof on it .
arrange your poultry on the endless spit ... in neat alternatives : the chickens there ... the lordly turkeys here .
make a pair of rhymes in opposition sweetly set .
poultry can be poetry .
don't forget .
crust is the body , sugar the wire .
i thought of you .
a heavenly lyre !
drink to my health .
here comes my wife !
hide the money !
do you like it?
it's ridiculous .
paper bags?
well ...
thank you .
heavens !
you've torn my books apart !
my friends 'poetry , rent from my heart !
i put the rubbish to use .
sacrilege , woman !
you insult our poetic muse .
you defile verse .
it's all it's good for !
what would you do with prose?
ah , my boy .
what do you want?
three pies .
here we are , good and hot .
please ... wrap them up .
in a bag?
well of course .
like ulysees , the day he left penelope ...
not that one .
blond phoebus ... " no !
make your mind up .
all right , all right !
children ...
give me the poem and you'll take six pies home .
phyilis !
butter has smeared her sweet name .
phyilis
what time is it?
oh , my god !
seven o'clock .
what a fight that was last night .
which one?
in verse !
ah , the duel .
in verse !
he's obsessed .
at the poem's end ...
not again !
i hit .
at the poem's end ...
lovely !
at the poem's end ...
the time?
seven o'clock .
i hit " .
what a ballade !
have you hurt your hand?
it's just a graze .
some trouble or other?
no trouble .
i think you're lying .
can i be alone with someone here?
i'm afraid not .
my poets are coming .
for their first meal !
you'll be all right here .
here they are !
brother poet !
tell her , i can't ...
write to her then?
that's it .
write a letter and leave .
eat your fill .
the lyre sustains the poet !
a recipe in verse .
listen my friends !
yes , yes , we're listening .
breakfast?
dinner .
a recipe for making almond tarts " .
poised on steady legs your poet begs several eggs .
froth them to a mousse and introduce lemon juice .
add milk of almonds sent down by zeus .
place your pastry , not too hasty in your tart plate .
lightly glide around the side .
slowly pour your mousse into the pastry base .
bake in the oven till blond .
melting mouths and hearts you have ...
your almond tarts !
do you like cakes?
terribly so .
good .
take a couple of sonnets and fill them with eclairs .
do you like cream puffs?
yes !
fresh pastries?
i love them .
now go and eat outside .
but ...
come back when you finish .
roxane ...
this is indeed a blessed moment .
often you ignore whether i still breathe or not .
but now you've come to say what?
first , thank you .
for what?
that viscount , that fop from whom you made a pretty crop .
a lord in love with me ...
de guiche? wanted me to marry .
a feeble disguise .
i fought then , cousin against such lies ... not for my nose but your bright eyes .
the other thing is ...
but before i mention it ...
i have to rediscover the almost brother of our games way back .
when you spent the summer in bergerac .
little roxane was called magdeleine .
was i pretty then?
you weren't plain .
you'd hurt your hand up a tree
what's this scratch , pray?
oh , what's this?
no !
put your hand flat .
still , at your age?
where did you do that?
at play , near the porte de nesles .
a fight?
hardly , it was just an argument .
tell me , while i clean the wound how many were they?
almost a hundred .
tell me !
no .
you tell me your story if you dare tell it now .
now , i dare .
i breathe the perfume of the past .
yes , now i dare .
i'm in love with someone .
he doesn't know .
well , not yet .
but he will know very soon .
and he loves me too , but timidly from afar , without a word .
give me your hand .
how hot it is .
love is on those lips of his .
and just think , dear cousin he's a soldier too and in your regiment .
he's a cadet in your company !
he seems so intelligent and clever .
he's proud , young , brave and handsome .
handsome?
what's wrong?
nothing .
it's just ... just ... my hand hurts .
have you spoken?
never .
he's a cadet?
in the guards .
what's his name?
christian de neuvillette .
he's not in the guards .
he is .
from today on .
i've finished , sir .
read the wrappers then !
my dear girl , you who love elegance and fine language what if he's a brute or savage?
his curls are those of a classical hero
his brains may be curly too , you know .
what if he's a fool?
i'll die on the spot .
i came here to be told this?
i don't see how it concerns me .
no ... listen .
someone told me about the gascons in your company
and how we treat greenhorns such as he?
i'm scared for him .
so you should be .
when i saw you calm those brutes last night strong and proud with all your might
i knew you'd frighten anyone .
all right i'll protect your little baron .
you'll take care of him then?
you're such a dear friend !
you'll be his friend?
yes .
he'll never fight a duel?
i swear it .
oh , how i love you !
i have to go now .
you didn't tell me your story .
it must be incredible .
tell him to write to me .
oh , how i love you !
a hundred men?
farewell .
we're friends , aren't we?
he must write .
a hundred men !
you must tell me about it .
a hundred !
what courage !
i've been braver since then .
he's here !
incredible !
wonderful !
unbelievable !
thirty wounded !
it was worthy of an epic poem !
brilliant !
unheard of !
homeric !
our hero .
he's wounded !
capdedious !
no !
just scuffed .
hug me !
tell us the tale !
the tale of the fight !
the tale !
enough !
what's the matter?
nothing .
she spoke to you?
is that true?
bravo for this new feat .
the word's spread wide .
there speaks an expert .
these gentlemen confirm the truth of it .
we were there .
a hundred against one .
are you one of these mad gascons?
a cadet .
one of us !
these young men are the notorious
captain?
would you present the company to the count?
he's in a foul temper .
well?
not today .
i'll do it in his place .
go on then .
the gascon cadets of castel jaloux .
liars and gamblers
gamblers and liars unashamed ... more noble than ..
their lines are long
their tempers short .
the gascon cadets of castel jaloux .
eagle eyed , always game cat's whiskers , lion's might nearer they came in boots to make them lame but with a heart so light for they thirst for fame .
sweet is their name in the great fight .
ever ready to main they put foes to flight .
the gascon cadets make cuckolds every night !
a gentleman's retinue needs a poet .
will you be mine?
i don't join retinues .
my uncle , richelieu , would approve .
i could help you .
good god !
i suppose you've written a play?
yes , a tragedy .
the title?
agrippian .
take it to him .
really?
he'll only change a few lines of it .
never , sir .
my blood runs cold to think one could be so bold .
you're proud .
you've noticed , have you?
look , cyrano .
we found this on our way feathers of the fowl you sent away .
the victims 'remains !
their employer must be in a fury !
but who was he?
it was i.
they were to do the lowly task of punishing a drunken rhymer .
a true epic poet !
you dared ...
would you like to return these to your friends?
you thwarted the plans i made ...
to murder?
insolence !
swords up !
we're leaving !
out of here !
all of you !
monsieur , have you read don quixote?
i've practically lived it .
meditate on the windmill chapter .
chapter thirteen .
if you fight with windmills ...
are my foes like the wind? their heavy spars may spin you down to the mud .
or lift me to the stars .
you must admit ...
i shall never be sated !
i like to displease and be hated .
with more calm , fortune and fame
what should i do?
seek out a powerful patron to pursue?
cling to him like a vine?
wind around him to fawn and whine?
and rise through ruse instead of merit?
no thank you !
compose , as a rule poems for usurers?
play the fool hoping to see some minister give a smile that's not sinister?
no thank you !
breakfast off a toad?
grovel on the dirty road?
wear the knees of my breeches through?
and kiss feet too?
no thank you !
find genius in imbeciles?
and let out shrtill squeals of regret when my name is missing from some gazette?
no thank you !
be scared of being thought paltry?
prefer social visits to poetry?
write placets and be introduced?
no thank you !
no thank you !
but sing , dream ... laugh ... move on ... be alone ... have a choice ... have a watchful eye and a powerful voice wear my hat awry ... fight for a poem if i like and perhaps even die .
nevre care about fame or fortune and even travel to the moon !
triumph by chance on my own merit .
refuse to be the clinging ivy nor even the oak or the lime .
perhaps i'll not get far .
but i'll get there alone .
you act proud and bitter .
but i know that she refused your love .
quiet .
the tale of the fight !
later .
no , now !
there's a thing you should never mention
like a rope in a house where a man has hanged himself .
look at me .
you understand?
oh , his ...
a word not to say if you wish to live another day .
even a gesture can anger him .
using a handkerchief puts you in a coffin !
captain !
how do we tackle boastful gascons?
show them northern courage .
the tale at last .
well , towards midnight , i was on my way to meet them .
the moon was like a watch up in heaven .
but , suddenly a watchmaker long forgotten pushed a light could of cotton over the silvery case of the round clock
darkest darkness fell on the dock .
the gloom was hiding my foes .
you could see ... no further ...
than your nose .
who is that man?
he arrived this morning .
really?
baron christian de neuvil ...
good ...
i ...
good ...
where was i?
mordious !
you couldn't see your toes .
i was thinking that for some drunken poet
i was about to hit a great man ...
on the nose .
in the teeth ...
tooth for tooth !
why should i stick my ...
nose .
finger ... in that pie?
for a man so great could break my ...
nose .
my fingers !
on , son of gascony .
i then found myself ...
nose to nose .
face to face with a hundred angry louts stinking of ...
nose herb !
onions and stale wine !
i pounced ...
nose down !
i disembowelled two !
impaled a thrid !
a sword went " sneet " .
i replied ...
snout !
damnation !
everyone out !
the tiger awakes !
leave me alone with him !
he'll hack him to bits !
terrifying !
crumbs of cadet .
hideous !
come to my arms !
you're brave .
very brave .
good .
come on .
i'm her brother .
whose?
hers !
roxane's !
her brother?
well , a fraternal cousin really .
has she ...
told me?
yes .
does she love me?
perhaps .
i'm so happy !
this is a change of heart .
forgive me ...
he is a handsome devil !
she wants a letter ... from you .
oh , no !
it's impossible .
impossible?
why?
because i'm a brainless fool .
the way you tackled me was not brainless .
i can find words for an attack .
it's simple , military wit .
but ... with women i become tongue tied .
their eyes look kindly on me .
but your words destroy you .
i can't talk .
i can .
but it's the looks i lack , see?
oh , to speak with elegance .
oh , to be a handsome musketeer .
roxane is precieuse , demanding charming .
i need wit ... and eloquence .
i'll lend you it !
and i'll borrow your good looks .
we'll be a hero for storybooks .
what?
can you learn by heart what i teach?
you mean ...
you fear chilling her heart ...
will you or won't you?
your look scares me .
will you?
what's in it for you?
it ...
it ... would amuse me !
a tempting challenge for a poet .
together as one , we can do it .
i'll be at your side you my beauty , me your guide .
that letter she wants !
i can't ...
here it is !
it just needs signing .
don't worry .
you can send it .
in a poet's pocket , you often find the product of an active mind .
take it , you'll see .
take it .
it's very eloquent .
will it suit her?
like a pair of gloves .
her love is such that she'll believe this is for her .
dear friend !
well?
most surprising .
we can mention your nose now?
a letter of love composed in my mind to you ... a lady so kind .
my soul next to the paper i sit .
all i have to do is copy it .
i'm in your hands .
this paper is my voice .
this ink , my blood .
this letter ... is me .
in your presence confusion grips ... my heart .
my tongue is in a fetter .
if kisses could be sent by letter
you cold read my words ... with you lips .
far from this world ... of brutal lies is a land for lovers who despise violence , wepping for the lost the lonely .
a land for lovers and for lovers only .
roxane !
we have to go !
we'll be late !
we'll miss the talk on the tendre .
stay outside !
i came to say goodbye .
you're leaving?
for the war .
this evening .
for the siege of arras .
there's a siege?
my going leaves you cold .
not at all .
i'm afraid it does .
shall i see you again?
and when?
did you know i'm now colonel?
of the guards .
the guards?
your boastful cousin's regiment .
i'll avenge myself there .
the guards are going?
of course .
what is it?
sadness .
someone leaves for war ... someone one holds dear .
you never said such words before .
you say them as i go !
you want revenge on cyrano?
are you for him?
no , against .
do you see him?
seldom .
i see him everywhere .
your revenge is to send him to the war he loves !
that's banal .
i know what would hurt him more .
what?
leave him to rot in his barracks while the others go off to war .
the only way to hurt a man like him is to strike at his pride .
oh , woman !
only a woman could dream up a scheme like that !
he'll eat his heart out in frustration .
you'll be avenged !
you love me then !
i should like to see this as a sign of love , roxane .
it is .
i have sealed orders to be given to the companies within the hour .
this one for the cadets , i'll keep .
ah , the battle loving swine .
you play games then?
sometimes .
i'm mad about you !
tonight , i must be gone .
but leave one so dear
near here , there's a convent to which i'll flee .
the capucins will hide me .
people will think i've left .
but , in disguise
i'll come back to you , sun of my skies !
but your reputation ...
and the siege ...
who cares?
say yes .
no !
say it !
you have your duty .
go now .
christian stays .
i want you for my hero , antoine !
heavenly words !
you love ...
i'm trembling .
i'm going .
happy?
yes , dear friend .
we're going to be late !
don't worry .
they'll wait .
cousin !
ah , cyrano ...
who are you looking for?
what?
are you looking for someone?
yes , i'm looking ... for christian .
he writes all day but , on seeing me , runs away .
oh , help me , please .
what does he write about?
his passion stirs my mind .
his words leave me blind .
come , quickly .
coming .
oh , how i love him !
is he so eloquent?
more than you .
an expert in words of love?
an expert , sir , inspired from above .
lysimon !
oh , felixerie .
barthenoide !
dearest uranie !
go and find him !
i want to hear words to charm my ear .
i want to hear him say the sweet words he wrote today .
come on !
i must go .
the monkeys are waiting .
look , the knocker's muffled .
it's silenced so its bevel won't disturb us ... the little devil .
ready your memory to be wreathed in glory .
what's that?
the words you'll say .
she wishes to hear you .
there's no time to waste .
learn this .
make haste .
learn it !
i won't learn a thing !
i'm tired of using your words .
i know she loves me .
i'll speak alone .
really?
i can do it .
i'm not stupid !
you've taught me a lot .
i'll manage .
anyway , i know enough to take her in my arms .
you're on your own !
wait !
don't go !
mouth , a marvel when you smile .
mouth , whose words are honey cake .
leave the admiring world awhile .
kiss the dreaming gods awake .
lovely eyes whose precious glance sets hearts shimmering like a lake .
mirror of the stellar dance ,
lips , the marvel of all lips
flowers that the bee mouth sips .
mouth whose breath is summer bliss .
store of pearled perfection , this
was made to kiss , to kiss , to kiss
are you there?
it's me .
no , wait ...
the air is sweet .
night is here .
we're alone .
come on .
sit down .
speak .
i'll listen .
i love you .
yes .
talk to me of love .
i love you .
that's your theme .
embroider it .
embroider it .
embroider it .
i love you so much .
yes .
and then?
and then ...
i'd love you to love me .
tell me you love me .
you give me milk instead of cream .
say how you love me .
i love you ... so much .
unravel your feelings !
your throat !
i want to kiss it !
i love you !
again !
no ...
i don't love you .
that's better .
i worship you !
oh , no !
sorry !
i'm so stupid !
it displeases me as much as if you were ugly !
recover your eloquence .
yes , i know .
please ...
you love me .
i know .
now go !
bravo !
good night .
who's there?
who's throwing stones?
it's me .
who?
i wanted to ...
oh , you ...
i want a word .
you have no words .
i beg you ...
that would be fatal to our love !
you love me no more .
heavens , you say that ... when i love more .
that's better !
love grows , rocked in my soul as i fret
and that cruel child too it for ...
a bassinet !
that's better !
but since it's cruel ... should you not have stifled it in its cot?
i did try ... the young child to seize .
but the new born babe is a little ...
hercules .
much better !
his first act was to hound out two snakes ...
pride and ...
doubt .
that's excellent .
but why are your words so hesitant?
why?
it's dark ...
they grope in the darkness ...
looking for ... your ear .
my words have not that problem .
it's normal they should find their way .
for it's upon my heart they prey .
my heart is large whereas your ear is small .
besides , your words slip down speedily along the wall .
mine are heavy like fruit on a bough .
they're arriving faster now .
they're used to the exercise .
i'm standing here in the skies !
one harsh word from so high could make my heart die .
i'll come down .
no !
climb up here !
no !
why ... no?
let us stay near ... but talk without seeing each other ...
without seeing?
it's quite wonderful ... in darkness .
you see a cloak of blackness .
i see a dress of summer white .
i'm but a shadow .
you are a light .
i'm using my true voice .
indeed , it is altered .
in this dark night ... which protects me , i can be myself .
and i dare ...
where was i?
i don't know ... all this ...
forgive my emotion .
it's this sweet , new sensation .
new , you say?
yes , new .
i can be honest .
fear of mockery gripped my breast .
mockery?
for my feelings !
my heart in modesty , cloaks itself in art !
ah , " art " .
how i hate that in love !
it's a crime , in love , to play this pantomime .
there always has to come a moment ...
and i pity those who know it not . when we a noble love attain but each pretty word causes pain .
so what word will you find for us when that moment comes?
all those , all those ... which come .
everything , i throw away .
i'm stifling !
i love you .
this is no game !
my heart cries your name !
i've loved you every passing pay .
last year , on the twelfth of may you changed the style of your hair .
i was dazzled ... by its bright flare .
do you feel my soul rise up through the darkness?
everything tonight is so wonderful so sweet .
i speak , you listen .
me , at your feet !
even in my sweetest dreams , i never planned on this .
my purpose is fullfilled .
now i can die .
my poem makers her tremble in the boughs .
i can feel the shaking of your hand come down along ... this jasmine strand .
i tremble and weep .
i love you .
you have bewitched me .
death may come for me .
this bewitchment is my doing .
i have done this !
i ask only one thing ...
a kiss !
what?
what do you ask?
yes ... i ...
too hasty !
make the most of it !
yes , true , i did ask ...
for heaven's sake !
i know now i was too bold .
so ... no !
grant me not a kiss .
why? quiet , christian !
what did you say?
i'm grumbling at myself for going so far .
quiet , christian .
wait .
get that kiss ! patience !
where are you?
we were talking of a kiss .
yes , the word is so sweet .
be silent !
how shall we define a kiss?
the seal set on a promise .
a promissory note ... on the bank of love .
the o of love on waiting lips .
a secret with the mouth as its ear .
eternity in the instant the bee sips .
a flower scented host .
a way to know the other's heart and touch the portals ... of his soul !
stop , please !
yes , i shall stop , madam .
up you go !
i don't think i should ...
are you still there?
mount , you animal !
yes?
what?
magdeleine robin ... does she live here?
yes , i'm her cousin .
what is it?
i have a letter for her .
what is it?
a letter .
you , here?
who could write so late?
a sacred matter no doubt as a holy man ...
de guiche !
he dares?
i've stayed here for this night with you , my dear .
i'll come in secret .
wait ...
i hope the lips which smiled of late ...
father !
listen carefully to this
richelieu must be obeyed whatever you may say or do .
that is why i send this note to you with this holy , intelligent and discreet brother .
he is to perform the marriage ceremony at once .
marriage?
to whom?
at once .
what is this?
i diot .
she's making it up .
you must marry christian .
i know you don't like him .
try to be brave .
courage , child !
i was right not to be worried .
it was indeed a holy matter .
it's terrible !
is it you?
him .
he doesn't seem so terrible .
are you sure?
give the convent 120 pistoles .
what a holy man !
resign yourself !
i am resigned .
we must marry .
we must obey .
do you so wish it?
yes or no?
i think so .
hurry .
de guiche is coming .
you've fifteen minutes to do the wedding !
you'll be my witness .
hurry .
on your feet !
witness to what?
hurry !
candles !
a cloth !
a crucifix !
the rings !
what rings?
and blessed laurel !
who is this?
where did he fall from?
the moon !
what time is it , earthman?
who is it?
i can't see .
is he mad?
what time?
what land?
what day?
what season?
i'm confused .
i fell down from the moon !
really !
i fell .
if you say so .
a madman , perhaps .
i don't mean metaphorically .
a century or a minute withal how long was my fall?
i was in that saffron coloured ball .
what continent is this?
be honest .
keep nothing from me .
god in heaven !
are you all black down here?
what?
is this algeria?
this is a mask .
so i'm in venice , or genoa !
a lady awaits me .
this is paris then !
amusing , isn't he?
you laugh .
yes , but i want to pass .
so here i am in paris .
i was brought by the rain to this .
i came through ether to get here .
my eyes are full of star dust .
my spurs bear some planet's crust .
here , on my doublet a hair from a comet's tail !
i slipped by neptune's fork ... and fell onto libra's scales .
see?
they point to my weight !
go to hell , sir !
by heaven , do you doubt my word?
he's here !
oh , my god !
hurry father !
why should we hurry a prayer .
that's enough !
take that off !
my mask !
no more mask !
i'll tell you about the moon and the inhabitants of its rotundity .
can you tell how i got there by means lighter than air?
guess !
he's a madman .
the tide !
the moon pulls the sea so wide !
i lay on the sand after a dip .
the moon had my head in its grip for the air holds water in .
i rose straight up in the air like a cherubin .
i know that voice !
i must be drunk !
fifteen minutes are over i'll let you go .
the wedding's done .
open up , it's cyrano !
they've just exchanged rings .
a fine couple , my son , tanks to you .
take leave of your husband .
what?
your regiment's about to go .
for war?
doubtless .
not the cadets .
they're going .
here's the order .
run and deliver it , baron .
obey , sir !
what are you waiting for?
hurry up .
the wedding night can wait !
my sorrow is not as great as he believes .
you're leaving too !
promise me you'll keep him out of danger .
i'll try ...
make sure he doesn't catch cold .
i'll do my best .
make him faithful .
well ...
make him write to me .
that , i can promise .
wounded?
no .
they're used to missing me every morning .
you're mad to risk death every day for a letter .
i promised he'd write .
but don't tell him .
if she knew he's starving ... but still handsome .
go and sleep .
don't grumble .
i cross the spanish lines when they're drunk .
you could bring back food .
i can't .
i have to travel light .
we , the besiegers , are now the besieged
the shame of it !
will you get some sleep?
when i finish .
what?
another letter .
calm down , lads !
stop it !
that's enough !
what is it?
they're hungry .
so am i.
my ears are rumbling .
your stomach has no ears !
richelieu feasts in paris .
send for a partridge .
i'll have veal !
stewed mutton !
braised beef !
black pudding !
duck pate !
beans !
pancakes !
with ham and mushrooms !
i'm hungry !
food !
that's all you think about .
come here , bertrandou shepherd that you were .
play a tune from back home , just for me
a tune to set memories free .
listen , gascons ... with the pipe to his mouth he takes us ... back to the south !
it's he tune the goatherd fingers
the hill where mist still lingers
listen ...
there's the glade the heath , the forest way ...
the little shepherd with his red beret .
the green of spring on the dordogne .
listen , gascons .
it is all gascogne .
you're making them cry .
homesickness !
a nobler hunger ... than the hunger of the flesh !
you'll weaken them .
really?
see?
a roll on the drums is enough .
alas , a gascon .
a false one .
gascons are supposed to be mad .
a sane gascon is dangerous .
he's pale .
he's hungry , poor devil .
he's not suffering though !
take your cards , peipes and dice .
i'll read descartes .
he's green .
skin and bones .
i'm mocked here .
i know it , gentlemen .
you southern petty seigneurs have no respect for commanders .
enough !
i scorn your renown .
my battle tactics are known .
yesterday with my men ...
i charged three times .
and your scarf?
you heard then?
at the thrid charge i was forced towards enemy lines .
i was in danger of being musketted .
when i had the idea of dropping the scarf ... showing my rank .
thus , i was able , unnoticed to leave the spaniards attack again and beat them with my men .
what do you say to that?
that henri iv would never against such odds , have let fall his white panache .
the attack was a success .
but you gave up the nonour of being a target .
had i been there but our courage is different
i'd have taken the scarf up myself .
a vain gascon boast !
a boast?
lend it to me and i'll charge with it tonight .
a vain offer .
you know the scarf was left in the gun blasted enemy sector .
where no one ... can fetch it !
here it is .
thank you !
i can give the signal i was reluctant to send .
who is it?
a spaniard , my spy who'll tell them by and by .
he's most useful and , indeed ... this very night , i'll lead my men to dourlens for supplies .
you will stay .
but the spanish ...
they know .
and at dawn ... they'll attack
hold them back for us an hour or two .
but to do that ...
kindly lay down your lives .
so this is revenge?
take it to mean i serve my king and vent my spleen .
thanks for such candour .
you fight a hundred singlehanded .
you should be delighted .
gascony cadets , farewell .
what's that?
nothing .
you're lying .
show me .
really?
yes , show me !
it's your final letter .
to roxane?
who else?
oh yes !
you've a winged messenger?
you can cross as far as vimy .
impossible .
you've been?
yes ... at night .
often?
more than you think .
every day?
answer me !
yes , every day .
twice .
it so excites you , you risk death ...
for you .
no !
for her !
you never told me !
i understand ...
you don't .
you're wrong , christian .
what's that circle?
a circle?
it's a tear !
the poet charms himself .
this letter , it was so moving .
i cried as i wrote it .
where are you going?
we need a gun .
take le bret and four or five men .
where are you going?
vimy .
he's mad .
during mass , we'll steal their food .
we'll die , but not of hunger .
take this .
hey , it's hot !
we've got the roast .
coming?
go without me .
how did you get here?
via vimy and the forest .
madness !
the siege is so long .
you can't stay .
why not?
he's right .
don't stay .
spain is coming this way .
let's fight !
you must go .
i want to see a battle .
i'm hungry .
the air is sharp .
what is there to eat?
chicken , wine and pies .
could you bring me that?
we have none .
all right .
quail , trout , ham ... anything .
but where from?
my coach .
we must serve and carve .
i have a valued man with me .
go closer , gentlemen go and see .
the bundles ... are full of partridges !
catch !
each case is a little larder .
red or white wine?
please have a little bread and wine .
why are you crying?
it's too good .
is our precieuse a heroine?
monsieur de bergerac , i am your cousin .
where are the cadets?
unbelievable !
have they deserted?
to your stations !
what's wrong with you?
it's the though of battle .
they're drunk !
who?
us?
get up !
battle stations !
thank you , sir ...
so kind ...
what have they drunk?
they're all mad !
shoulder arms !
attention !
greetings monsieur de guiche .
there they are !
leave at once !
never !
will you stay?
very well .
bring me a musket .
what?
this lady is in danger !
give him something to eat !
food?
we've all had some .
i won't eat your leftovers !
you're improving .
i'll fight hungry .
hear that gascon accent?
me?
he's one of us !
stay here .
where are you going?
wait for me .
why did you come?
your letters .
a few words ...
quiet .
you wrote so many .
beautiful ones , deny it you might .
god , i love you since that night when , in a voice unknown ... your soul came forth .
those letters this month , you see , were you talking to me .
i read them and swooned .
i was yours .
your love burned .
forgive my frivolity of loving first your beauty .
later , your spirit charmed me and i loved both .
and now?
one side has beaten the other .
i love you for your soul .
your beauty drew me towards the true reality .
can't you see this as a victory?
you just can't believe it .
i just want to be loved for ...
for what you've always been loved .
this is better .
it used to be .
you don't understand .
i love you for what you are .
less handsome ...
i'd love you still .
even without beauty
don't !
i mean it .
what?
ugly?
ugly , i swear .
you're pale !
she loves me no more .
what?
it's you she loves .
all she loves is my soul .
that means you .
and you love her .
me?
you do .
it's true .
madly .
more than madly .
tell her !
no !
why?
look at me .
tell her !
no !
stop tempting me !
i'm tired of being my own rival .
i want her to choose one of us .
you .
i hope so .
what is it?
nothing .
get inside !
what did he say?
he's going !
perhaps he thought i lied .
and did you?
no .
i'd love him ...
are you afraid to say it?
i don't mind .
if he were ugly?
even if he were ugly .
even deformed?
even deformed .
were he ridiculous and grotesque would you love him?
more than ever .
my god .
so , perhaps , after all , happiness ...
what?
listen , roxane ... i want to ...
he's not dead .
roxane ...
i told her everything .
it's you she loves .
no , christian
get her away !
stay with me !
the fight is on !
his letter ...
you alone knew him .
wasn't he a marvellous spirit?
yes , roxane .
a supreme , lovable poet?
yes , roxane .
a sublime being?
yes , roxane .
a deep , saintly herat a magnificent and pure soul?
farewell roxane .
he's a duke now .
and a marshal .
he hasn't been for months .
still in mourning?
as ever .
still faithful?
that too .
have you forgiven me?
i'm here .
sister marthe stole a plum this morning
that's very wrong .
calumny is a sin .
it was tiny .
i'll tell monsieur cyrano .
i've made him an angel cake .
he's a bad catholic .
we'll convert him .
i forbid you to meddle with that matter
don't torment him .
he may stop coming .
but god ...
don't worry .
god knows all about him .
sister , i ate meat yesterday .
he says that?
every time .
last saturday he hadn't eaten for two whole days .
even dead , you love him?
it seems only part of him is dead .
our hearts are together .
his love is alive , around me .
ah , here's le bret .
does he come often?
your grace ...
he won't be here until seven .
who won't?
cyrano .
oh ... him .
how is he?
not well .
really?
he exaggerates .
i foresaw it all : loneliness , misery !
his pamphlets make new enemies .
he attacks snobs and hypocrites cowards and fools .
everyone in fact !
his sword inspires terror .
don't pity him .
he knew no allegiance a free man in thought and deed .
i know .
i have everything , he nothing .
but i'd gladly shake his hand .
farewell .
i'll show you out .
sometimes , i envy him .
when your life has been a success without having any real sins you feel a slight disgust within but no real remorse .
just a faint discomfort .
the ducal robes of fur sweep up the stairs of state with a rustle of lost illusions and regret .
you're philosophical .
monsieur le bret .
may i have a word?
no one dares attack him , but he's hated
cyrano could die by accident .
warn him to be careful and stay indoors
a doctor , monsieur !
get a doctor !
will you stay with him?
i'll be back .
the clock's struck .
he should be here .
he'll come .
he always does .
there he is !
i'm running out of wool .
these faded colours !
how can i match them?
late for the first time in fourteen years .
i know .
it makes me mad .
i was delayed , in fact by an importunate visitor .
an annoying one?
yes , but not unexpected .
you sent him away?
sorry but today is saturday .
i have a regular aapointment to keep .
i dare not miss it .
come back in an hour .
he'll have to wait .
i won't let you go until it's dark .
i may have to leave earlier .
no teasing sister marthe?
sister marthe , come here !
those lovely downcast eyes !
what's wrong?
nothing .
i ate meat yesterday .
i know .
yet you're so pale .
come to the refectory later for a bowl of soup .
you will?
is she converting you?
oh , no .
i promise i'm not .
tell me the news of the week .
it's time for my gazette .
saturday the nineteenth ...
after eight helpings of ginger the king , by the lancet was put out of danger .
sunday , the queen gave a ball and burned seven hundred and sixty three white wax candles .
our troops vanquished john of austria on monday
four witches were hung .
the same day , madame d'athis's dog had an enema
that will do !
tuesday ... nothing .
lygdamire has a new lover .
thursday : the court was in fontainebleau .
friday the twenty fifth ...
la mancini , the dark one ... said " no " at dawn and " yes " at dusk .
and saturday ... the twenty sixth ...
don't worry , it's nothing .
come on .
it's my wound from arras ... sometimes ... you know ...
my poor friend !
it's nothing .
it will go .
it's over .
we all have our wounds .
i have mine .
the old wound is still here , so keen .
the paper of his last letter has yellowed but still bears his tears and blood .
his letter !
didn't you say that one day you'd let me read it?
you really want to?
his letter?
i want to ... today ...
here you are .
can i open it?
open it .
read it .
roxane , farewell , for i must die .
out loud?
later today , i think , my dove .
my heart is heavy with unexpressed love
and i'm dying !
never more , never more will my captivated eyes ... that gaze ...
how you read it ! which adored such moments will no longer embrace your every movement .
i can see one now you often make when you hruch your hair away .
i cry out ...
you read it in such a way
goodbye " .
you read it ...
my dear , my darling ... with a voice ... my love ... with a voice ... which i've heard somewhere before .
my heart never left you .
i am and will be in the next world the one who loved you with all this soul .
the one ...
how can you read now?
it's dark .
it's dark ...
it was you .
no , roxanne , no ...
the way you said my name ...
no !
it wasn't me !
it was you !
i swear ...
i can see your generous imposture .
the letters were yours .
no !
the dear , mad words , yours .
the night voice .
i swear not !
that soul was yours !
i didn't love you !
you did !
it was him .
you loved me !
you're less sure now .
no , no , my dear love , i never loved you
so many things fade way to be reborn .
why keep silent for fourteen years since on that letter the tears were yours?
the blood was his
cyrano !
you're here !
good evening , my friends !
he killed himself to come .
that weakness earlier?
that's right , i didn't finish my gazette .
on saturday the twenty sixth one hour before dinner
monsieur de bergerac was fouly and ignobly murdered .
what have they done to you?
fate's a jester .
i always wanted to die in battle .
and here i am killed in an ambush from behind , by lackeys ... with a beam .
so be it i made a mess of everything
even my own death .
don't cry so , ragueneau .
go and get help !
no , no .
don't go .
when you ... come back , i'll be gone .
what do you do now , fellow poet?
no more cakes?
no , i work for moliere .
my friends ruined me ...
and your wife left you .
moliere?
what do you do for him?
i snuff out the candles .
i'm leaving him though .
i'm so angry !
yesterday , during scapin a scene was by you .
all of it !
yes , the famous monologue .
moliere stole it !
he did well ...
was the scene a success?
they laughed and laughed !
my life's work has been to prompt others and be forgotten .
remember that night when christian came to your balcony?
that moment sums up my life .
while i was below in the dark shadows others climbed up to kiss the sweet rose .
it's only fair .
i say , as death has me in its hooks
moliere has genius and christian was handsome .
sister !
sister !
help !
no !
don't call anyone !
let them pray .
the bell is ringing .
i've made you so unhappy .
i have !
i have !
you?
of course you haven't .
i knew not womanly sweetness .
my mother found me ugly .
i had no sisters .
later , i feared the mistress with mockery in her eye .
but thanks to you , i have had a female friend .
thanks to you a dress crossed my life's path .
i love you !
live !
it's too late , cousin .
i must go up ... to the opaline moon .
many of those i love are in exile up there .
i'll see scorates ... and galileo .
philosopher and scientist poet , musician and duellist and traveller in space .
witty converstationalist and lover too , too unlucky in love
here lies hercule savinien de cyrano de bergerac who was all ... and who was nothing .
i'm leaving now .
sorry ...
i can wait no more .
see?
the moon beam is here at my door .
no one must help me !
only ...
only the trees !
he's coming .
i feel myself shod in marble .
gloved in lead
as he's on his way i shall go to meet him ... sword in hand !
what?
it's useless?
i know .
a man doesn't fight to win .
it's better when the fight is in vain .
who are they all?
there's a horde of them .
ah , i know you .
all my old enemies !
falsehood .
cowardice .
compromise .
i know you'll get the upper hand .
never mind .
i'll fight on , and on , and on !
you take everything ... the laurel and the rose too !
go on , take them !
but , in spite of you one thing goes with me now
and tonight , when i at last god behold my salute will sweep his blue threshold with something spotless , a diamond in the ash ... which i take in spite of you and that's ...
my panache .
