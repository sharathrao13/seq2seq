yeah !
do not go over there .
trust me .
jimmy , please .
calm down , calm down .
don't blow this .
not over her .
this is not eighth grade prom .
how you act , these things are important .
jesus christ !
he's giving her a ring .
that's not good .
please take it back .
whatever it is , you can deal with it later .
this is not the time .
just work with me on this .
jimmy .
i'm so sorry .
go .
just go .
i don't
let me explain it to you .
hey , you need
get away from me .
play somewhere else .
just listen .
five minutes .
go away !
jimmy .
don't push me , don't push me .
go .
fine , fine , okay !
play your game somewhere else .
get the hell away from me .
move , move , move !
move !
i need backup !
pull over !
come on , jimmy , pull over !
get away from me , man .
just
you want to go through me?
come on .
i want to fight him .
for what?
for what?
you weren't there?
what do you think he did , take your woman away?
why did i let him take her away?
she was gone .
she was always gonna leave .
what do you know anyway?
your brother puts so much pressure on you . . . . . . you looked for an edge .
you figured she was it .
why do you act like you care?
i'm just a thing to you , part of the job .
you pick up a check to help me out since you didn't help yourself .
why does that make you better?
it doesn't .
why did you take the car?
i don't need to be pushed .
go on , say it .
forget this .
you hoped this would get you thrown out .
you 're looking for the exit .
what are you talking about?
you don't know who you are anymore !
you think you've got to be perfect or you 're a failure .
well , forget that .
just forget it .
i was gonna give this to you before all this went down .
impressive , isn't it?
what is it?
it's the first thing i ever won .
it was probably the last time i ever felt pure victory .
no pressure , nobody breathing down my back .
just driving because i loved it .
pure .
that's where you've gotta get back to .
doing it naturally , for you .
i don't have your gift , but i do have some things you don't have .
i got will and i got faith .
don't laugh , i'm serious .
i believe that you can will yourself into anything and do anything .
having faith , that's like believing in
that's like having a good disease , it's contagious .
hang with people that have it , you 're gonna catch it .
that'll change your attitude .
and winning is an attitude .
so if you trust me no , if you trust yourself . . . . . . by this season's end , you'll be on top or you won't .
but i guarantee you 're gonna know what jimmy bly is made of .
outside chicago , at the chicane it goes up . . . . . . and comes down right where you got brandenburg
is that when i dip down?
forget it .
i'm tired of these spoons .
we play with spoons .
say , " ah .
ah .
welcome to germany .
home of beer ... ... the autobahn and beau brandenburg .
qualifying begins tomorrow .
with two races left ... ... beau is leading in the race for the world championship .
jimmy bly is in second .
commissioner gilson has slapped bly and teammate , joe tanto ... ... with a $25, 000 fine ... ... for their recent joyride through downtown chicago .
doing great , jimmy .
keep pushing that speed .
hey .
you don't need to talk to me anymore?
it's not like that .
really?
what is it like?
all right , here you go .
jimmy .
three , two .
one .
beautiful .
come on , buddy .
now , is he a hero , or is it hype?
what do you think?
what do you want me to say?
i want to hear what you think !
jimmy just needs time to develop , that's all .
when he can get it together off the track , he will on it .
that's what i think .
like you got it together?
you can help the kid off the track more than on it .
you 're not racing on sunday .
i'm bringing memo back .
come here .
joseph , over here .
sit .
at my level .
it's the moment of truth , my friend .
if he doesn't deliver next time out , he goes .
don't hate me , but you go with him .
i'll come around here in turn 7 .
driving off brandenburg , i'll fake outside .
eight's a tough place to pass .
i'm gonna carry that speed . . . . . . bring it down the straightaway .
i have plenty of speed .
kind of flawless .
you 're not even paying attention .
watch this .
show me again .
yes , sir .
if you find yourself in a position to hold up traffic , do it .
i don't want any front running .
you know the drill .
don't hurt yourself .
i told you and i told you too .
what?
i told you i'll return .
here i am , returned .
like the real borrow .
there's no helmet big enough to hold that head .
there's so much love in here .
you keep smiling , your face is gonna crack .
why shouldn't he smile?
he's got a lot to be happy about .
he's back where he belongs .
right , baby?
yep .
good?
hey , you 're so good .
you win this , yeah?
you 're gonna win .
be safe , all right?
you too , be safe .
this is the second to last race of the season .
and what an exciting one it promises to be .
the crowds are here .
it looks like there's a thunderstorm maybe a mile from the track .
the rain threat hasn't dampened ... ... the spirits of this crowd here in germany .
what do you want?
wanted to apologize .
apologize to yourself .
let's race .
i want you to stay in your world and don't get into his .
you push him hard .
you get him thinking about you .
and you 're not thinking about him .
got it .
the skies are opening up as the warm up lap begins .
how's jimmy?
he's all there .
we are racing in germany .
beau brandenburg is starting in the pole position today .
jimmy bly is in second .
brandenburg moves out in front on a course you can race in the rain .
brake tires are on and they are at speed .
memo moreno is back , giving jimmy bly help as his teammate .
i'm sure memo wants to make his presence felt today .
boy , he is on the fly .
it's like he has something to prove .
good move , memo .
keep it steady .
somebody wants their job back .
i think joe tanto may want to watch his back .
somebody's spinning !
kenny brack , he's in trouble .
he's gonna go way back in the field on that one .
back at the front the battle continues .
look at brandenburg .
he cuts off bly !
he tries to take me out .
detach it .
hold your line .
ride his blind spot .
i will , joe , but i can't see a damn thing .
neither can he .
just patience , my man .
patience .
take him , jimmy !
take him !
jimmy bly in second place .
putting the pressure on beau brandenburg .
push it .
here we go .
bly is gonna try to make a move in the corner ... ... on brandenburg on the outside .
he does it !
bly takes the lead .
goddamn brilliant .
car in trouble , spinning on the wet pavement .
looks like gidley .
oh , here comes max papis !
crash !
head on into that car !
max papis is airborne .
if he takes it to the inside , don't follow him , he's setting you up .
in the hairpin , that fight for the lead continues .
jimmy bly has the lead now .
brandenburg wants it back .
brandenburg goes to the high side .
he gets by !
brandenburg back to the lead .
keep going , he's putting on a show .
it's a hell of a show .
yeah , hell of a show .
now memo moreno whips out of the pack and passes andretti .
he's really trying to get up there with brandenburg and bly .
memo , what are you doing?
i can almost touch him .
hold your position .
why?
he's gonna win this .
i'm sure carl henry is not too happy with moreno .
now bly wants to make a move .
hold on , memo moreno trying to make ... ... the same move on jimmy bly , his teammate .
memo , no passing .
do you hear me?
i'm right there , carl .
lift off .
steady .
what are you doing?
moreno appears to have something to prove here .
he gets alongside bly again .
damn it , we went over this !
lift off !
lift off !
you work for me .
i said , lift off .
why don't you let him drive?
come on , baby .
come on .
come on .
come on !
shut up !
i've got to do this .
with his teammate in the battle for the championship ... ... moreno decided to stick his nose into this fight .
hey , memo , back off .
only inches separate these two cars .
memo , you're too close .
what's going on here?
bly is spinning .
he gets it under control .
he's going backwards on the track .
jimmy , what are you doing?
jimmy , what the hell are you doing?
memo?
get out !
oh , god !
we're getting chopper pictures .
this is horrible .
the car is upside down .
it's in a body of water .
moreno is pinned underwater .
it's okay , memo .
i'm here .
beau , memo crashed .
jimmy went after him .
you gotta help .
he went into the river at turn 5 .
i'll get you out , memo .
it's gonna be okay .
i'm on my way .
beau , what are you gonna do?
please be careful .
oh , god !
my foot !
oh , come on .
hang on , memo !
hang on !
help me !
get out !
help me !
get out , now !
it's gonna blow up !
hurry !
we've got bly and brandenburg to help a man in trouble .
rescue teams are on the way , but the remote location ... ... of this crash makes it difficult to reach them .
lift it up , higher .
lift it !
take a breath , memo .
come on .
we 're here .
we 're gonna get you out .
now !
come on .
one , two . . . .
get it over .
memo !
we got you , memo .
come on , memo .
i can't move my leg !
come on .
it's gonna be okay .
fuel everywhere .
they better get that driver out of there and themselves too .
that fuel could ignite , it could be floating on the water .
come on !
hurry up !
that is horrifying .
i've never seen anything like that .
it's unbelievable .
worried about the well being of another driver , another competitor .
goes to show the kind of men they are , their true fabric .
but they worked as a team together .
oh , my god , look at that !
are they okay?
it looks like they are .
i think i see
i see movement .
i can't move my legs .
i can't move them .
jimmy?
jimmy?
you all right?
it's just my foot .
you'll be fine .
you'll come through this fine .
how's memo?
fine , they 're looking after him .
our thoughts , of course , with memo moreno and his family at this point .
hey , memo .
hey , joe .
how do i look?
never looked better .
jimmy?
yeah?
hey .
thanks .
memo , i'm sorry .
you came back for me .
saved my life .
we race .
we take chances .
i took this chance .
so look at me .
look at me .
don't see you .
see me .
one who made a mistake .
that's all .
it wasn't a mistake .
how are you doing?
i'm all right .
all right if i come in?
yeah .
you tried to get him out .
so did you .
you were there first .
i mean , he almost got you killed and you still tried .
anybody would've .
would they?
you 're a good man , jimmy .
i'm sorry , i didn't want to win the championship this way .
see you .
the old joe tanto had a couple of attributes you should hold on to .
there but for the grace of god , it's not me .
quietly taking your place in the pack .
where is that guy?
where has he gone?
who cares?
i do .
i miss him .
you 're the first to know i'm terminating the kid's contract .
why?
i don't think he's the real deal .
i don't think he's mentally tough enough .
i don't think he's adult enough !
gets out of a car in a race .
saved a man's life .
i'm not here to debate !
i'm gonna go for brandenburg .
next year .
what are you doing?
whatever it takes to win .
his brother know?
he's brokering the deal .
don't do this .
it's done !
then undo it .
you suddenly care .
don't kill him off !
don't kill him off?
i watched you kill yourself !
you had everything , and you threw it all away !
and i had to sit there and watch !
the slowest man in the fastest sport .
i wake up every morning , my legs are on fire .
i know i'm gonna have to sit in this chair for the rest of the day .
but if they gave me one more chance , i'd do it all over again .
it ain't gonna happen .
we are all damaged .
i've got an excuse .
you don't .
do you?
i want you to know that i know about you going out to brandenburg .
where have you been?
meeting after meeting .
i've got a dinner right now .
catch you later?
yeah , i'll see you tomorrow .
okay .
hello .
jimmy , it's sophia .
is everything okay?
something i have to tell you .
what restaurant did you pick?
nina , you 're in great hands .
you are going to love this place .
demille .
jimmy .
what are you doing here?
i'll just be a minute .
please don't walk away from me .
did you sell me out?
are you working for brandenburg now?
we should take this inside .
why are you doing this to me?
wait a minute !
who sold out first?
i would never sell out my own brother .
when you stopped listening to me that's what you did .
i just tried something different .
for the first time i thought for myself .
was that wrong?
shutting me out is different .
and i was with you all the way until you handed your mind over . . . . . . to that has been .
who got you here?
who got all the glory?
you couldn't book a plane ticket without me .
there's no worse feeling getting someone . . . . . . to the top only to have them drop you .
you did that , you .
ten years , jimmy !
all a waste .
it was coming together .
why not wait a bit longer?
because i'm not your goddamn waiter .
i was your manager .
and i deserve better than that .
i deserve much better !
now you 're over , and i am not going down in flames with you , brother .
that's one trip you 're taking alone .
welcome to the grand prix .
it's a sunny day .
it's going to be a great race .
after an eventful season ... ... this comes down to championship time .
everything's set .
let's get this thing signed .
after the race it'll be a madhouse .
what do you say?
let's hear what she says .
what's her idea?
her idea?
what do you mean her idea?
how does it feel?
what?
how does what feel?
to be used .
what , i didn't treat you with manners?
you 're gonna blow this over that?
what , do you want to hit me?
would that make you feel better?
hurt?
a little .
didn't hurt .
call that a punch?
did you know?
i know what?
i know about my brother?
yeah , i knew .
you could've told me .
i hoped you could work things out .
he was right , you know .
never booked a plane ticket .
remember i said by the season's end you 're gonna know what you 're made of?
it's the end of the season .
it's up to you .
carl , you have to let me race .
i can win .
any driver that can't get out of the car in five seconds can't run .
trying to prove you 're better than i think?
yeah .
time him .
ready?
go !
four seconds .
great .
not bad .
now the vertical test .
carl , don't push it .
the vertical test .
you jump up and down on the bad foot 10 times . . . . . . to see if you can handle the pressure .
again , my rules .
don't glare , joe .
makes your eyes look small .
it's all about commitment , right?
right .
right .
all right , jimmy .
one .
two .
three .
four .
five .
come on .
six .
come on , jimmy .
seven .
come on .
eight .
nine .
ten .
yeah !
good .
too bad you didn't try that hard sooner .
there are 100 laps ... ... 200 miles between this race and a champion .
bye bye , daddy .
bye , lucas .
going into this race , brandenburg was thinking ... ... he was the winner of the championship .
he was four points ahead , and bly looked out of the running .
we've just received word that bly will be driving ... ... which is amazing news after his injury he suffered in germany .
so as it stands , if jimmy bly wins this race ... ... he will become the new world champion .
so why'd you do it?
you helped me .
i thought maybe i could help you .
well , i appreciate it .
it's okay .
don't go too fast .
take care .
appreciate you coming .
take care of yourself .
jimmy bly is a hero today , along with joe tanto and beau brandenburg ... ... who all got to the scene of memo moreno's crash ... ... which had his car in the water .
he was about to drown .
they jumped in , got him out of the water ... ... before a big explosion consumed the entire area .
you know that if i lose this race , i'm going to blame it on you .
that's what i'm here for .
i love you .
i love you too .
gentlemen !
start your engines !
let's look at the starting grid .
beau brandenburg in the pole position .
gidley will be following him .
joe tanto in the nextel car starts 10th .
bly is starting in the 26th pole position .
he didn't qualify today .
he's got 100 laps to catch beau brandenburg ... ... if he wants to become world champion .
we're off to a good start here in detroit .
brandenburg's jumped out in front .
trouble !
tanto's caught in traffic .
he doesn't have anyplace to go !
ladies and gentlemen , we are under a yellow flag ... ... until the cars can be removed .
joe tanto is in the pit with a broken front wing .
what's the story on tanto?
tanto is out of it .
don't worry about him .
got it .
that's too bad .
come on .
come on !
ladies and gentlemen , we have just one lap until green .
go , go , go !
a fast pit stop for the nextel team , but this unfortunate mishap ... ... is going to drop tanto to last place ... ... right behind his teammate , jimmy bly .
so , jimmy , what do you think?
it's not looking too good .
we can work through this .
you think so?
i know we can if we stay tight and close .
okay .
let's do it .
green flag comes out again .
i'll take it right , you cut left .
look at this amazing teamwork between bly and tanto !
hey , joe , not bad for an old timer .
that's it .
every man for himself .
hey , not so fast .
who wants to be in front of the other?
what the hell are you two doing?
back off , back off .
don't be afraid of me .
why would i be afraid of you?
carl , let joe race his race .
thanks , kid .
i appreciate that .
let's split them at the turn .
i'll take the inside .
they split around another car !
as they battle , it brings both cars forward .
pass me on the left , jimmy .
way to go .
tanto and bly are double teaming the entire field .
what an incredible display of driving !
come on , don't stop now .
stopping?
who's stopping?
we are now halfway to the checkered flag .
okay , joe .
try to keep up .
still back there , joe?
i'm still here .
i'm impressed .
bly passes and tanto is following suit .
with just 20 laps to go , jimmy bly has just moved into seventh place ... ... and teammate , joe tanto , is in sixth .
everybody's off the pace .
but bly and tanto are coming on strong .
brandenburg still leads .
in second place is alex barron .
barron has an engine go !
two cars swerving to miss the oil !
car up over the wall !
several cars involved !
here comes jimmy bly .
he closes on the accident .
bly has nowhere to go .
bly and tanto find themselves in second and third ... ... behind beau brandenburg .
the drivers will take advantage of this full course caution ... ... and enter the pits for the last time this season .
brandenburg , bly and tanto all are completing very fast pit stops .
now , with 10 laps to go , beau brandenburg is in first place ... ... jimmy bly is in second , and joe tanto is in third place .
the world championship comes down to these last 10 laps .
jimmy , show them what you 're made of , kid .
okay , joe .
green flag !
we're back to racing !
it's a sprint to the finish and championship .
bly is right on brandenburg's tail .
he wants that championship .
take him now .
make your move .
he comes alongside brandenburg .
brandenburg cuts him off !
bly is gonna try it again .
he cuts and ducks inside !
bly has the lead !
jimmy bly has just taken the lead .
bly gets past brandenburg .
he's in the lead .
great driving by bly .
brandenburg won't let bly get away that easily .
i'll pull him back in .
there's time .
brandenburg is putting pressure on bly .
don't overreach , kid .
just four laps to go and you are the world champion .
he's losing it .
come on , jimmy !
bly may be in trouble .
he weaves back and forth .
brandenburg is right there , ready to get past him .
and brandenburg goes to the lead !
nice while it lasted .
bly loses the lead with three laps to go .
he tried .
this is something we've seen this young rookie do so many times .
carl henry has got to be disappointed .
what is he doing?
jesus .
he's back .
now , joe tanto making a move .
he comes up alongside jimmy bly .
he passes him !
tanto to second .
they're shoving and elbowing each other .
brandenburg , tanto , bly .
one , two , three .
we've got one lap to go .
let's do it .
joe tanto has taken the lead !
unbelievable .
it's incredible .
i can't believe it .
but problems with tanto's car !
tanto's in trouble .
will it hold together?
no , not for long .
hang on , joe .
stay in there .
what's he doing?
he ought to park it but he stays in front !
i can't hold it together !
take it , jimmy !
they split him !
he's lifting off !
i see that .
he had it !
tanto has removed himself from the race , leaving brandenburg and bly .
neck and neck down the homestretch , battling for the world championship .
jimmy , just drive because you love it .
drive for pure victory .
he's humming .
thanks for going , jimmy .
pure victory .
you're right there .
suddenly , jimmy bly seems to have a renewed vigor .
you'll buckle !
back it down !
tanto's suspension has broken .
he's now spinning .
but the battle is up front for the flag !
here it comes .
right down to the finish .
bly takes it !
bly wins the world championship !
beau brandenburg finishes second , and joe tanto finishes third .
following brandenburg , spinning across the finish for third place .
i'll say , the hummer has taught us something here today in detroit .
they 're gonna kill me .
joseph .
you could've won that race , right?
i did win .
thanks .
hey , you were incredible .
i know .
i lost because of her .
this year's champion , jimmy bly !
luc !
glad you stuck around .
you were really something out there .
beau brandenburg !
go on , you 're missing your celebration .
don't you go anywhere .
come on , go !
and finally , our third finisher ... ... joe tanto !
jimmy !
jimmy , you did it , man .
thanks for everything .
you owe your brother too .
whatever button he pushed got you going .
listen , enjoy this .
it doesn't last long .
