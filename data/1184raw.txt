actually , i had a band .
we just played some clubs , here and there .
guess the name of our band

people who drink with their pinkies up are ... more likely to be a playboy .
oh , you caught me .
it's become a habit because it's comfy
your song ...
i'd really like to hear it sometime
don't think i can sing it anymore
my voice is gone

i think she's my girlfriend but what she thinks ...
here you go
you and i seem to have a lot in common
lemon peel angel , kurt cobain , too .
he begged me for another chance
and i really caved in
so i decided to give him just one more chance .
yeah?
good for you
it's his last chance
hey

his and her watch set
it's cheap
you don't need it

the traffic
i told you over and over not to be late today .
it's just ten minutes anyway , sorry , sis .
sorry
i'll be a little late
i picked out some movies , so watch .
it's to thank you for fixing the tv
i don't usually wear watches
it's to make me feel better try it on once
i'll start wearing one , from today .
dongsuk , what was your childhood dream?
a magician huh?
a beautiful woman is trapped in a big aquarium , and i rescue her with a scarf .
doesn't suit you
you don't believe me ...
wait a minute
there's a guardian angel beside you
we can't see it , but it's in here .
now look
can you see?
feel it feel it
one second
what is it?
oh , it's nothing
what?
a friend sent me a message
let me see
congrats on your ancient 29th birthday
eat well , live well .
jjung
today's your birthday?
yes
then you should be getting presents , not me .
your magic is more than enough
on a day like today you should be with someone you love , not me ...
don't you have a boyfriend , aeryun?
no
that's strange .
a woman like you ...
men have their eyes on backwards
swoosh , he'll be at my side .
this is practically a jail
did the owner go somewhere?
yes , she did
i wanted to see a good movie ...
congratulations thank you
can i keep this?
of course
what you want for a present?
come close to me take my hand
don't leave me alone anymore
another me trapped inside myself
today , i wait ... for you again
though i am happier waiting for you than being with you , watch me , i am getting tired .
take my hand
if i could love you , as if we've met for the first time ,
i want to say i love you , as if for the last time .
hold out your hand and capture me
comfort my weary soul
the other me inside myself cannot withstand , day by day .
waiting for the warm touch of your hand .
your song is really great when does the album come out?
well ...
when the time is right
for a while it seemed like it would happen , but it didn't .
then it really seemed likely , but it fell through .
i have high hopes this time , but i don't know .
someone out there will discover your music .
hang in there
it's always hard to be true to yourself .
come close to me take my hand
don't leave me alone anymore
another me trapped inside myself
today , i wait for you again .
though i am happier waiting for you ...
i'm so touched .
what's the occasion?
you've grown soft to be touched by so little
why the watch?
oh , it was a present
guess you'll be keeping time now
there's nothing recent
aeryun picked some tapes to help me work .
aeryun?
i said before ,
lemon peel angel .
oh , lemon peel angel .
good work sure
let's go to my office
the songs ... did you sing all of them?
yes
the songs are quite usable
thank you
these days i manage a young entertainer .
ah , he sings well .
and ... his looks aren't bad
excuse me?
nowadays you need more than just a good voice .
well , i'm packaging him as a songwriter and performer ...
so what you're trying to say is ... the fellow you're managing , let him have my songs?
well , in other words , yes .
the client's chest is a bit dry , so moisturize it with breast cream .
use suction and concentrate it there
okay
hello?
thank you .
olivia elfoulage .
how's that?
comfortable?
yes
excuse me , telephone for you
don't be too dejected you've held on this far
easygoing , enjoyable , if it's beautiful , better still ...
that's how i see my music
but i keep hitting a wall
don't grow weak on me i believe in you
of course , you're stubborn .
and when you fix onto something ,
you don't let go
you get hurt by little things
maybe that's why i like you
let's get married first
i'd like for you to focus on your music in a stable environment .
i don't like you seeing this side of me .
i don't want to say thanks or sorry anymore .
i've no shame left
i wish you'd consider me as important as your music .
rather ... if you hadn't met me ...
what?
if i hadn't met you?
how could you say that?
you're a burden on me , so you'd rather be alone to suffer?
is that it?
heesoo , it's not ...
whenever i talk about us , you end up talking about music .
it may be different from your worries but it hurts me too .
breathing together , worrying together , making compromises , comforting each other .
i want that life now .
heesoo
don't second guess me or i end up second guessing you
dongsuk
hello
where did you drink so much?
i drank a little , a little .
is something wrong?
no it's nothing
it's just that ...
oh , because of me ...
no i was just about to close up
wait a minute
here
thank you
if you ... really want something , they say it'll happen , right?
then if something doesn't happen , it's because you didn't want it enough .
if what you wish for doesn't happen , there's something wrong with you .
i thought i knew about these things
i desperately wanted it
there's something wrong with me i know all this ...
i ... fell asleep here?
i couldn't wake you
did i do anything wrong?
no have some hot tea
dongsuk
i have something to say to you .
yes?
i
i like you , dongsuk
aeryun ...
it was hard for me to express my feelings .
but i have a ...
you have a girlfriend i know
hello?
it's aeryun ...
oh , yes aeryun
i haven't seen you at the store ...
i've been a little busy with my work
i'm not sure if i'm bothering you
no
don't work too hard
come by the store if you get a chance .
then i'll see you later
sure
hello , thank you , this is sad movie
the prince of egypt?
one second
ryu dongsuk
sure i'll bring it right over
who is it?
have you been well?
yes , but ...
if you finished the prince of egypt , i'll take it .
oh , yes who is it?
i told you before the video store owner
oh , i see
hello hello
wait one moment
aeryun , right?
huh?
dongsuk told me a lot about you
i see
let's have dinner sometime i hear you helped a lot
yes ...
you're not driving me home?
oh
that girl ... she's prettier than i thought .
uh huh ...
i'll wait for you
you'll find someone special , too .
i really like you , dongsuk .
aeryun ...
i like you , too .
but not in that way
i love you just how you are
i'll wait
you know i already have someone i love
loving someone just because you met her first is stubbornness .
you're the stubborn one , aeryun .
who is it?
it's a rare music video i had a hard time getting it
i thought it might help you work
if i need anything , i'll stop by .
then will you invite me in for tea?
i've something to tell you
i have nothing to say to you
it'll just take a minute
how can you just barge in?
what kind of person are you?
you're making me into a strange person
i just want to say something
i have nothing else to say to you
i don't need to hear anymore he's already been here
what?
seemed to be in his own world i remember ...
too weak
things must be hard for him to get a manager ...
ryu dongsuk
who is it?
a customer from here?
no
oh , her .
the one you came with .
she was here a few days ago , alone .
what?
by the way , she looked familiar .
i think i've seen her around
how'd you know her?
the video shop across the road
we just became friends
she misunderstood
she even knows about heesoo
then tell her you don't like her
how can i say that to her face?
with women , you gotta be clear to save confusion .
this is the place
when you come here alone , use my name .
this looks good
why are you doing this?
if you think about it a little , your heart ...
there was nothing between us there'll be nothing in the future
if you call or come one more time ,
i won't stand for it .
dongsuk , one second don't hang up , dongsuk
always , before i can finish , you close the door , hang up , or turn away to leave .
if you heard me out once , you wouldn't look at me that way .
dongsuk i know work is stressful
someday you'll meet someone who understands your music .
you need to be strong
this is min jihae , the manager at loudness .
i saw you sing at a taehakno cafe .
i'd like to meet you
please call 539 6778 when you get this message
you should watch good movies
films are like food
junk food's tasty but it will give you a stomachache .
huh?
what a jerk .
go ahead and watch your good films
go home early tonight
okay
is this ryu dongsuk's house?
yes that's me
happy birthday will you sign here , please?
have a good day
happy birthday , dongsuk .
if you don't have any plans , let's have dinner together .
i'll wait at the place we met for my birthday at 8 : 00
i ... wanted to do the same for you
you were there for me on my birthday
what the hell have i done wrong?
you don't seem to be hearing me
i'll be honest
i never once thought of you as a woman
you got it?
if i've done anything wrong , it was getting to know you .
and my only fault was loving you
we've been looking for this kind of music .
i'm so lucky
i don't know if i'm lucky or if you're the lucky one but please do your best .
i will thank you
dongsuk , you looked so young then .
to celebrate your album , i'll edit that for you .
thanks
looks like he sings better after a few drinks .
right?
yeah , right .
please re enter your password
please enter your four digit password

wouldn't it be nice to live this neatly?
there'd be nothing to clean
why'd you buy so much juice?
the phone has been turned off .

it doesn't look right all alone
just leave it
what's wrong?
should i get a new place?
where?
well , anywhere ...
because of that woman?
who?
the video store owner
i had a feeling
you didn't do anything wrong , did you?
no
then why move just to avoid her?
there's no need
come close to me take my hand
don't leave me alone anymore
another me trapped inside myself
today , i wait for you again .
to be with you ...
dongsuk , the emotion's missing .
try again
are you the new owner?
you and i seem to have a lot in common
lemon peel angel ,
kurt cobain , too ...
they say if you really want something , it will happen .
so if something doesn't happen , it's because you didn't want it enough .
if what you wish for doesn't happen ,
there's something wrong with you .
take your time there's no rush
oh , you're a playboy .
what?
if you drink that way , they say you're a playboy .
right i've heard that a lot
a friend of mine told me
a friend?
is she by any chance ...
you wouldn't know her
you said you saw me sing where was that?
where?
actually , when aeryun brought me the tape ,
i didn't expect much
i promised to keep it a secret
what the hell did you do?
what are you talking about?
do i look so pathetic?
you wanted me to know , huh?
if i make an album due to you , did you think i'd come crawling to you?
that was just a coincidence
what gives you the right to do this?
i just wanted to be a help to you
why do i need your help?
the thought makes me gag !
you ... were happy when you got the deal
you're sick in the head
you're completely insane
yeah , you're right .
i'm insane .
but you know what?
people who fall in love , they all go crazy .
go
was it you?
why give love ... to someone who won't return it?
go you shouldn't be here
dongsuk?
who ...
who ...?
why won't dongsuk come to me?
if it weren't for you ...
we truly ... could have been happy
i beg you please leave
i can't leave dongsuk
please ...
let's talk later
this pain , it's not even pain
do you know of my love?
for dongsuk ...
i can endure any pain
please ...
please stop
you'll be fine , even without dongsuk
without dongsuk , i ...
without dongsuk ...
i'm tired
i also ... want to end it now
but ...
i can't help myself
i thought i knew what love was
but i'm not sure anymore
that a person could be so devoted to another ...
i'd like us to ... take a break for a while .
would that be a good idea?
can we be ...
like the way we were?
heesoo said she wants to break up
i said okay
you're one hell of a woman
you say you love me?
then leave me
i'm begging you
was having to leave , was it all a coincidence?
looking at the rainy road , you're leaving me again .
still together , all those moments ...
my name is aeryun jung aeryun
ryu dongsuk that's you?
i can find a copy for you
hello you must work in this area
i like you , dongsuk
she's left so don't worry about it and go
do you know where she went?
what do you want to know for?
as long as she's gone , what do you care?
i wish i knew , too .
where she went ...
there are some people ... who are always left behind .
