let's roll !
hey !
i'm coming !
huh? !

hey !
hello?
walter?
yes?
i have some bad news .
it's about your two uncles , son .
walter?
walter?
walter !
good news ... you're spending the summer with your two uncles .
it's just going to be for a few weeks .
a month or two , tops .
scout's honour , okay?
cross my heart and hope to die , okay?
where are you going this time?
the fort worth college of court reporting .
i met a guy last night .
he's going to pull some strings .
walter , you're going to have to learn to trust people , or you're going to grow up bitter and disappointed .
you're going to have fun with your two uncles .
you'll see .
mum , you're an only child .
i know what uncles are .
well , mr smarty pants ,
it just so happens , they really are your uncles .
your great uncles .
my mother's brothers .
they disappeared 40 years ago and just now showed up back here in texas .
can't i come with you?
no !
honey , i'm going to be working my tail off learning court reporting .
i'm doing everything i can to keep this family together .
how about a little help here , okay?
now , look ... they say these two old men got millions stashed away in cash .
nobody knows where they got it .
got no kids , no one to leave all that money to .
you and me , we're as close as any family they got .
you want them to like me so they'll die and leave us their money?
we could buy a house , maybe settle down .
oh , wouldn't that be nice?
oh , look !
here it is .
here it is , honey .
here it is .
by the way ,
i hear these two were in some state nuthouse for 40 years .
got all their money from a big lawsuit or something .
but then there's lots of stories about them .
who knows what to believe?
just find out where they stashed all that money , okay?
maybe we should've called first .
no .
older people just love surprises !
here we are .
okay .
go away , go away !
hey , go away !
shoo !
show 'em you're friendly , honey .
let them smell your hand .
they must be down there by that lake .
let's go !
come on !
there he is !
winged him .
he's running for it .
damn !
empty .
get ammo .
i'll keep him covered .
yoo hoo !
huh?
yoo hoo !

uncle hub , uncle garth , it's me , mae !
mae !
pearl's daughter .
and i brought walter , your nephew .
relatives .
damn !
god .
we're old , damn it .
leave us alone !
the last thing we need is some little sissy boy hanging around all summer .
walter , honey , why don't you wait out here and play , okay?
i'll be a minute .
he could help out around here , do chores .
help out?
your kid's a damn wienie .
i know .
that's why he needs to be around real men ,
like you two .
it won't be for long .
he's got to cook for his damn self .
i'm not cooking .
nice doggie .
come play .
this is for your own good , walter .
you know ...
i bet all that money is hidden real close by .
imagine , a real buried treasure just like in those books you're always reading .
walter , maybe if you'd learn to smile once in a while , then people might like you .
now , come on , how about a big smile to remember you by?
okay?
come on !
you're going to have to work on that smile while i'm gone , okay?
bye , honey !
bye !
well?
if my mum calls , can we hear the telephone out here?
don't have one .
no telephone? !
is it okay if i go inside and watch television?
ain't got one .
no television? !
what do you do?
hey !
rumour has is you two have millions stashed away .
why not put some of that money to work for you with the high yield only investing in gold and silver can bring?
wee ooh !
wee ooh , wee ooh !

fixing to die any time .
so if we kick off in the middle of the night , you're on your own .
jumpy little fella .
mmm .
quiet though .
uncle hub?

he's sleepwalking .
brand new mattress and i'm still waking up tired and sore .
so ... you two disappeared for ... 40 whole years .
where were you?
africa mostly ...
morocco ,
algeria , kenya ...
not much sadder than a couple of has beens jabbering about the good old days .
those days are through .
so are we .
i hate this !
i hate it !
we're retired .
gardening is what retired people do .
what do we want any damn vegetables for anyway?

listen , kid , we know you got your heart set on going to montana , but it's late .
hub , help me out here .
why?
it sounds like his mind's made up .
good luck in montana , kid .
we've got better maps than that one at the house , right , hub?
yeah , a man needs a good map , that's for sure .
sure .
i've been to the orphan home before .
i don't want to go back .
damn it , kid , it ain't our fault you got a lousy damn mother .
guess i should get going .
which way is north?
i'll say one thing for this kid ... he sure pisses off the relatives .
listen , kid , do us a favour .
if you come back to the house and stay awhile , why , our relatives are going to hate it .
i bet they hate it so much , they go away and leave us all the hell alone .
it's crazy enough it just might work .
sure .
come on , kid , help us out here .
i guess i could come back ... for a while , seeing it's so important .
so kid , how's that root beer?
uncle hub , uncle garth , this has been such ... a wonderful weekend .
i hate to bring this up , but have you two looked at that will i left for you?
you both need to be thinking about these things at your age .
don't shoot !
don't shoot .
he's been here before .
brothers mccann?
this is no ordinary salesman .
hell , i like me a challenge .
can we talk?
come out where we can see you .
put down your guns and i'll come out .
this guy is good .
i'll cover , you sneak around . ... that's not complete .
what?
what do you?
what?
what?
why not see what he's selling?
let me just show it to you .
what the hell for?
it's right behind my car .
what's the good having money if you never spend it?
trust me .
it could be the kid has a point .
yeah , well ... we'll see what the man's selling .
then we shoot him .
good plan .
whew !
due to the ... unsettling nature of our previous encounters ...
i took it upon myself to search the world over for that ... that perfect item that'd be just right for two exuberant sportsmen such as yourselves .
and boys , well , i do believe i found it .
voil !
what is it?
well , that right there is the sport of kings .
up till now , only heads of state have been able to afford a fine piece of equipment like that , and it is so simple to operate even this child could do it .
really?
here .
i'll tell you what ... you step right up here and chunk that lever back on my signal , okay?
go ahead .
wow !
the most powerful one on the market , and very reasonably priced , i might add .
well , that is the biggest waste of money i have ever seen in my entire life .
mister , you load up that contraption and get the hell off this land .
we'll take it .
oh no , you don't !
i won't have my children around this gun foolishness .
then leave !
come on , daddy , let's go .
come on .
come on .
you know what happens when my feelings get hurt .
get in the car .
get in the car .
ah , ha
oh , suey !
pull !
pull !
pull !
uncle hub?
don't .
i tried to wake him once .
he nearly tore my head off .
leave him for a few minutes .
what are you doing out here so late?
what's wrong with him?
well , a man's body may grow old , but inside his spirit can still be as young and restless as ever .
and him ... in his day , he had more spirit than 20 men .
it looks like ... he's looking for something .
mm hmm .
what?
he's looking for her .
who?
what was her name?
jasmine .
okay , tell me .
you want me to tell you the story?
now?
that would take days .
well , uh ...
hub was always too restless for texas .
he convinced our folks that he needed to go to europe , and i needed to come along .
that was the summer of 1914 .
i la like you .
extra , extra !
germany invades !
unfortunately , just as we arrived in france , so did the kaiser and the entire german army .
i wanted to go home , but hub said we should tour europe one step ahead of the germans .
and we did .
what a time that was .
there were these girls in toulon ... twins .
and they ...
... anyway , we eventually wound up in marseilles with passages booked on the last ship out of europe .
and hub , he decided that we should spend our last night enjoying the local nightlife .
three , three !
he made friends with these soldiers , and they bought us some drinks ... strong , strange drinks .
we woke up on a ship bound for north africa ... shanghaied .
shanghaied?
yeah .
we found ourselves in the french foreign legion .
'it's all my fault , 'hub said , but he told me not to worry .
he'd make sure nothing happened to me .
we fought many battles against overwhelming odds .
he saved my life countless times .
when the war was over , we both went our separate ways .
i ended up leading safaris mostly for writers and hollywood folk .
but that was too tame for hub .
he got commissions from the new north african governments , to put an end to the slave trade .
no one , slave trader or bedouin , had ever seen anything like this mad american who fought like 20 men .
hey !
what the hell are you two doing out here in the middle of the night?
just enjoying the cool night air .
either one of you got a lick of sense , go to bed .
i'm a rolling stone from texas
rolling stones from the plains
i am a rolling stone from texas , boys
i long to be back there again
well , say , are you from texas?
that's what i'm wanting to know
'cos if we're both from texas , boys
let's bundle up our clothes and go ...
dear walter , how are you?
found your uncles 'money yet?
here i am at school in fort worth , my nose to the court reporting grind ... '
damn it , brother , i'm not going anywhere looking like this .
look like a damn sharecropper .
we're gardeners .
this is what gardeners wear .
i bought you some clothes too .
they're in your room .
think how good all these vegetables are going to taste .
peas , beans , squash , tomatoes .
yeah .
what's this row?
beets .
beets?
and what about this row?
potatoes .
potatoes?
yeah .
wait one damn minute here .
what's this row here?
tomatoes .
tomatoes?
yeah .
that's lettuce , squash , sweet potatoes , carrots , bok choy .
bok choy?
what is that?
chinese cabbage .
hey , that row looks right .
yeah , well , this is corn !
all those seeds did look alike , come to think of it .
yeah , like corn .
boy ...
that seed salesman sure saw us coming .
no , saw you coming .
corn , corn , corn !
nothing but corn .
corn .
corn .
by god , it's here !
kid , help him unload .
we'll be right back .
careful , kid .
he's a man eater .
is this the mccann place?
we brought your lion .
king of the beasts .
terror of the jungle .
you bought a lion?
a used lion?
stand back , kid , you don't want to get mauled and eaten .
what are you doing?
brother , this is the best idea you ever had .
this lion head will sure look good hanging over our fireplace .
what fireplace?
you don't have a fireplace .
we'll buy one .
you're going to shoot it?
well , be seeing you .
he's in there , alright .
i don't think this is very sporting .
kid , at our age , this is as sporting as we get .
walter , come here .
when i give the word , pull this .
pull !
hey .
come on out of there .
hey , you in the crate !
get your lion butt out of there .
looks awful tame .
this lion's no good .
it's ... it's defective .
it's alive , that's the main thing .
go ahead and shoot it then .
no , it wouldn't be sporting , shooting it inside a crate .
looks kind of old ... worn out looking .
some kind of lion hunt this is .
perfect .
a reject .
some sick zoo cast off .
so can i keep him?
i'll look after him and take care of him and feed him and everything !
i never had a pet of my very own before .
so kid , you want to take care of it , nurse it back to health?
good .
then we shoot it .
that's some lion you bought .
that's some garden seeds you bought .
don't worry , they're not as bad as they seem right at first .
i'll be right back with supper .
there .
now you can see out .
you sure he can't get out?
she .
it's a girl lion .
i named her jasmine .
what did you just say?
it seemed like a good name ... for a lion .
i'm sorry it took awhile to come in .
in 40 years , i never had a call for it .
'purina lion chow . '
i'll be !
if you wait a few minutes , my boys will load you up .
i got it .
garth , pay the man .
be careful .
mr mccann , those are bags that weigh 50 pounds a piece .
take the other end .
here we go .
if you two old ladies want to get in , i'll take you home now .
hub !
psst !
psst !
little boy !
you're with those mccann brothers?
i know that they're ex mafia hit men .
they're on the run with millions that they stole from al capone .
tell me more about africa ... about you and uncle hub and jasmine .
why would a smart kid like you want to hear hokey old stories?
what else do we have to do?
where was i?
'no one , slave trader or bedouin , had ever seen anything like this mad american who fought like 20 men . '
yeah right , right , right .
well , it so happened ... one of the women that hub freed was handmaiden to a princess .
when she told her mistress the story of her rescue , most of all , she told her about the handsome , heroic american .
'i must meet this man ! 'the princess said .
one day , hub was riding his horse along the mediterranean , when out of nowhere , another rider came up alongside .
but you know hub ... he wasn't about to let a chance pass .
it became a race .
most people say that hub was the best rider in north africa .
but this other rider kept neck and neck as the race went on and on .
then the two horses collided .
the riders went flying into the sea .
hub leaped to his feet ready for anything ... or so he thought .
this was the princess , the most beautiful woman he had ever seen .
jasmine !
jasmine .
many people say there's no such thing nowadays , it's something you only find in stories , but when these two set eyes on each other for the first time , this was honest to god , no kidding , sure enough , once in a lifetime ,
love at first sight .
wait a minute .
if it was true love they would've been married and lived happily ever after , right?
aren't you getting ahead of the story?
okay , keep going .
well ... things weren't easy for them back then .
she was promised to another man , a powerful sheik in a neighbouring kingdom .
he heard that jasmine was in love with another , so he threatened her father , and took jasmine off to his kingdom and locked her up in his harem .
she told the other wives that she would rather die than marry this heartless sheik .
she had a knife on her .
and when he came for her that night , she was going to slit her own throat .
what did uncle hub do?
they got married , and lived happily ever after .
the end .
but wait , if they lived happily ever after , then they got married , and she'd be here right now with us , right?
didn't they have kids?
where are they?
nurse?
what's going on?
i wish they'd tell us something .
get out of my face !
where'd you put my damn pants?
where's my pants?
you can't do that !
gimme my pants !
who put me in here?
who put me in here?
you two !
hospitals ...
lot of good they are .
how would you know?
you're never in one long enough to find out .
hey , you missed the turn .
i did not .
home is that way .
i want to go this way .
doctor , where is mr mccann?
oh , i'm afraid he's gone .
well , he led a long full life .
where is the body?
no , he's gone ... left .
mr mccann checked himself out .
left? !
brother , someday you're going to have to start acting your age .
what the hell does that mean?
all your life , you've never been frightened of anything .
so what's eating at you now?
getting old?
dying?
hell no .
what then?
being useless .
when we were young there was always a reason , there was a point .
things made sense .
now there's no point to anything .
so what do we do?
we garden .
we outlived our time , brother .
go get some beers .
alright .
hey , old man , how's that barbeque?
give me some .
we're busy , boy .
get lost , alright?
what did you say?
here's a perfect example of what i've been talking about .
since this boy was suckling on his momma's tit , he's been given everything but discipline .
and now his idea of courage and manhood is to get together with a bunch of punk friends and ride around irritating folks ... too good natured to put a stop to it .
hey , who do you think you are , huh?
just a dumb kid , hub , don't kill him .
right .
i'm hub mccann .
i fought in two world wars and countless smaller ones on three continents .
i led thousands of men into battle with everything from horses and swords to artillery and tanks .
i've seen the headwaters of the nile , and tribes of natives that no white man had ever seen before .
i've won and lost a dozen fortunes , killed many men and loved only one woman with a passion a flea like you could never begin to understand .
that's who i am .
now , go home , boy !
we'll show these old bastards whose tough !
get out your knife .
yeah .
now , boys , you're fixing to let those teenage hormones get you into a world of trouble .
damn it , garth .
did i ask you to butt in?
hub , you just come out of the hospital .
well , there's ... there's only four of 'em .
yeah , but ...
look , you fight this one first .
and then i'll let you fight the other three after , okay?
yeah .
watch this , kid !
now you !
you better pick that knife up ,
'cos , son , you're going to need all the help you can get .
come on , frankie !
get him .
get him , frankie , cut him !
ahh !
shoot , oldest trick in the book .
okay , okay .
you hold it wrong , son .
not like this .
you always do it like this ... smooth .
try it again .
come on , frankie .
come on , frankie , get him !
cut him come on .
okay .
get him , frankie , cut him .
yeah , you got him !
frankie , come on !
stop , stop , ahh !
you're breaking his arm !
you three had better get in there and help him .
why aren't you helping him?
hub always hogs the bad guys .
he's selfish that way .
but there's four of them !
three of them .
go on , hub !
hey , there's my boy !
like this , kid?
pretty good , huh?
couldn't you share?
nah .
after 40 years , i'm used to it .
ahhh !
besides , right now , i figure he needs them worse than i do .
go on , hub !
this'll hold him though .
this'll hold him .
please !
please !
they're not back yet , daddy .
i'm sure with hub just out of the hospital , they're taking it slow and easy on the way home .
yeah .
oh , i hate this house .
i hate it .
when those two finally drop dead ,
i want you to burn this place to the ground , daddy .
hey , what's that?
beats me .
let's tear it up !
yeah .
what is it?
it's stuffed !
mum !
mum !
he's alive !
what?
what happened?
i told you about those lies of yours .
no !
what have you done with uncle hub?
kid , get some meat .
where's uncle hub?
oh , lord , there's been an accident .
i want to go home now .
you're in no shape to go home now .
it was a fight .
uncle hub won .
it was great .
ahh !
the lion really did try to eat us .
shush .
jasmine?
oh jasmine !
i haven't fed her all day .
i bet she's really hungry .
i got to go feed her .
here , here !
here you go , jasmine .
jasmine?
there really is a lion .
lion? !
you got a lion?
it's locked up .
no , it isn't .
it tried to eat us .
it really tried to eat us .
get the guns !
get out of the way .
get the guns .
come here , come here .
jasmine?
jasmine?
jasmine?
jasmine?
come on .
oh !
eew , lion spit .
no , stop .
don't shoot , you'll hit him .
come on .
whoa !
they're gone .
we might be too late .
move in .
you stay .
stay .
jasmine !
stop , stop .
attack him !
she's feeling a lot better .
get off of me !
we're leaving .
we are not coming back until you get rid of that monster .
well , the lion stays .
alright , that's it .
come on , daddy .
daddy !
come on !
bye , uncle hub .
bye , uncle garth !
shut up .
get in the car .
i need a drink bad .
i'm having a bad day .
you boys hungry?
want to stay for supper?
what are we going to eat?
meat .
a lotta meat .
she won't come outta the cornfield .
this cornfield's the closest thing to a jungle she's ever seen .
she knows this is where she belongs .
i think she's happy .
i think she is .
what about you?
you happy?
what's he saying to them?
he's giving them his 'what every boy needs to know about being a man 'speech .
a lot of men have heard that speech over the years .
a lot of men .
will he give that speech to me?
oh , i guarantee it .
assuming he's still around , of course .
hey , you didn't finish that story about uncle hub and jasmine .
you don't believe this africa stuff?
it's a good story .
well , after he rescued jasmine , several years passed , wonderful years .
never were two people so happy , so in love .
it was perfect .
except for one thing .
the sheik .
the sheik .
he hated hub for stealing jasmine , so he put a price on hub's head .
10, 000 pieces of gold ... a fortune .
assassins came from miles around .
come on !
he and jasmine had to be on guard every minute of every day .
hub knew he and jasmine couldn't run forever , that sooner or later their luck would run out .
there was only one thing to do .
so one day an assassin led hub , bound in chains , into the sheik's fortress to claim his 10, 000 pieces of gold .
what? !
they gave the assassin bags and bags of gold as the sheik ordered hub down to the notorious dungeon of 1, 387 tortures .
what kind of greedy , no good scum would turn in uncle hub for money?
well , i would .
ah , it was a trick .
yeah , it was a trick .
in the dungeon , i drew my sword ...
and single handedly slaughtered everyone in there and freed hub without dropping a single gold coin .
wait a minute , wait a minute .
you saved uncle hub , all this time carrying hundreds of pounds of gold?
you don't believe i killed all those men and saved hub?
well , hub might've helped just a little .
we were greatly outnumbered .
we fought against incredible odds .
and when it was over , we split up .
each one knew what the other had to do .
high in his opulent bedchamber , the sheik slept .
he awoke with hub's sword across his throat .
the sheik was terrified , but hub just lowered his blade .
'defend yourself ! 'hub cried .
and he threw the sheik a sword .
the sheik knew that he would surely die now , without even the right to beg for mercy .
but hub just said ,
'twice i have held your life in my hands , and twice i have given it back to you .
the next time ... '... your life is mine .
and from that moment on , the assassination attempts stopped .
some say it was because the sheik was afraid that hub would return and kill him .
others said because hub had spared his life , the sheik did the honourable thing and let his enemy live .
personally , i think it's because the sheik was so damn busy once they discovered oil in his kingdom .
he became one of the five richest men in the world .
what? !
the bad guy gets filthy rich?
what the heck kind of story ends that way?
i just told it the way it happened .
bye .
so long .
so that's how you got all your money?
the gold from the sheik?
well ...
yeah .
those young men'll be okay now .
will you?
yeah .
i feel old and worn out .
you've been busy .
yeah .
terrorizing doctors and nurses , beating up teenagers , chasing after lions ... you've had a full day .
lucky those boys don't know diddly squat about fighting .
won't be long till the kid here can whup my ass .
won't be long till i'll be helpless in a fight .
useless !
you'll feel better in a day or two .
yeah , well ...
i'm going to bed .
good night , kid .
so ... you finally going to tell me what happened to jasmine?
nope .
what? !
you want to know what happened to jasmine you're going to have to ask him .
ask uncle hub?
are you crazy?
look what happened last time .
i'm tired of doing all the dirty work around here .
if you want to hear the end of this story , you're going to have to ask him .
hub?
yeah?
an airplane?
yep , always wanted one .
you always said you'd never set foot in an airplane .
you don't trust them to fall right out of the sky .
they're dangerous , alright , plenty dangerous .
you got a book of instructions or something?
yeah , right here .
you don't know a damn thing about airplanes .
well , i'm going to learn , i tell you .
a ha !
it says right here ,
'to climb , pull back on the stick ; to descend , push forward on the stick . '
i'll have this thing up in the air in no time .
whoo !
damn .
maybe it's just a new hobby .
maybe he doesn't really mean to ... you know , do something crazy .
you think so?
you ask him yet?
about jasmine?
you'd better make it quick .
what the hell?
it's the middle of the night .
what's the matter?
what are you doing here?
you got something to say to me?
spit it out .
what happened to her , uncle hub?
what happened to jasmine?
i have to know .
i have to .
she died .
died in childbirth .
her and the baby .
what did you do?
went back to the only life i knew ... back to the legion .
for the next 40 years , there was always one more war to fight .
then i got old and came here .
here i am .
here i am .
you cold , son?
you'd better ... here .
you'd better ... you'd better go inside .
good boy , thank you .
good boy .
those stories about africa ... about you ... they're true , aren't they?
doesn't matter .
it does too .
around my mum all i hear is lies .
i don't know what to believe in .
if you want to believe in something , then believe in it .
just because something isn't true , that's no reason you can't believe it .
alright .
there's a long speech i give to young men , sounds like you need to hear a piece of it .
just a piece .
sometimes the things that may or may not be true are the things that a man needs to believe in the most .
that people are basically good ; that honour ... courage and virtue mean everything ; that power and money , money and power mean nothing ; that good always triumphs over evil ; and i want you to remember this , that love ...
true love never dies .
you remember that , boy .
you remember that .
doesn't matter if it's true or not .
you see , a man should believe in those things , because ... those are the things worth believing in .
got that?
that was a good speech .
think so?
thanks .
yeah ...
when are you going to give me the rest of the speech?
when you're almost a man .
you promise?
wait one minute here .
wait ...
i can't be a good man until you give me the rest of the speech , right?
you need to stick around until i'm old enough to hear the whole thing .
i see what you're trying to pull .
you have to stick around
until i'm old enough ...
i'll write it down .
no !
i want you to give me the speech !
you won't be living here then .
you're my uncle .
i need you to stick around and be my uncle .
what about uncle garth?
he needs you .
w what about the dogs and the pig , and the lion?
we all need you .
i need you .
no , you're just being silly .
no , it's true !
you're being silly .
it's true !
i know you miss jasmine an awful , awful lot .
but if you go , we'll miss you just as much .
it's true .
alright , damn it , you win .
i'll stick around and be your damn uncle .
don't expect me to be happy about it .
alright?
deal?
oh hh !
ohh , ohh .
you're a good boy .
you're a good boy .
you're a good boy .
walter , walter !
get ready .
walter !
this money look stolen to you?
try to help you
i can't do it all by myself ...
i can't do it all by myself .
oh , honey , you're so funny .
no !
whoop !
oh !
shh , quiet !
mum !
hi , honey .
walter , walter , this is stan .
i've heard a lot about you , walter .
your uncles still sleeping?
best not wake 'em up .
shh , come on .
want to go sit down?
you got so big .
so , stan here is a detective .
a real private eye just like in the movies .
wow , really?
sure , sure .
you want to see my badge?
stan works in las vegas .
how about that?
what about court reporting school?
oh , i had to quit .
stan wants me to stay home and be a wife and mother .
won't that be wonderful?
i bet you found out where your uncles hid all that money , huh?
why do you want to know?
walt , your uncles match the description of two bank robbers from the '20s and '30s .
no , you're wrong .
when mae told me about them ,
i got copies of the reports and showed them to her .
it's them , honey .
they used shotguns .
they wore disguises .
they stole all that money .
and they shot people ... innocent people .
no , not them .
it can't be .
stan knows what he's talking about , honey .
what about jasmine?
she and uncle hub were in love .
they ...
i have her picture .
honey , wasn't jasmine the woman who was driving the getaway car?
ohh , right .
oh , jasmine ... she was wounded .
and they just drove off ... and left her for dead .
i know this hurts , son .
but they're criminals , and they lied to you .
my poor baby !
oh , in the arms of vicious criminals .
we came just as soon as we found out .
we've come to take you away .
now , i want you to tell stan where the money is , then we'll go pack your things , okay?
why do you need to know where the money is?
look at me , son .
because it doesn't belong to them .
it's stolen .
why , it's probably hidden right outside here somewhere , right?
close by?
i'll tell you what , why don't we take a little walk , huh?
show us around the place .
what do you say?
let's go .
well , walt , your mother and i found a nice house .
don't have enough money for the down payment though .
we could always turn your uncles in for the reward money , but they'd go to jail .
since all that money's stolen , honey , we got a right to it just as much as they do .
we'll have a nice family and nobody gets hurt .
isn't it wonderful , walter?
it's what we always wanted .
so , where is it?
they're old , they're going to die soon anyway .
you want uncle sam to end up with all that dough?
just tell us .
hub and garth didn't rob any banks .
they were in africa .
africa !
oh , walter , be serious .
really !
they were shanghaied into the foreign legion , and had adventures for 40 years .
they couldn't have robbed any banks !
come on , pal .
you don't believe all that , do you?
sure , i do !
you? !
mr doubting thomas?
here stan's got actual evidence and you believe that africa crap? !
yes .
yes , i do .
mae , you should go wait on the porch .
we're going to have a little chat , man to man .
why don't we talk in the barn .
what do you say?
come on !
getting warmer?
huh?
no , let go !
let's you and me get something straight .
we can be friends or we can be enemies .
i've had a run of crummy luck lately .
i know some bad people who want to cause a lot of trouble for me .
i need that money and i know it's close .
and i'll be damned if some snot nosed kid is going to stand in my way .
so what's it going to be , pal?
friends or enemies?
defend yourself .
huh?
where is it? !
where's the money?
where is it?
where is it?
where is it?
tell me where it is !
tell me where it is !
where is it? !
i heard some noise .
oh god !
jasmine?
oh my goodness !
oh my goodness !
stan !
it's dead .
oh my god , he's dead !
stan's dead !
no , he'll live .
i'm talking about the lion .
oh !
we have to get him to the hospital .
mae , get your car .
i can't , i can't !
mae , your car !
get it , get it !
okay , okay .
let's get this lion off him .
okay .
this man's going to need stitches .
a lotta damn stitches .
what happened to her?
it looks like her heart gave out in all the excitement .
yeah .
she was plenty old , you know?
look ...
i think she's smiling .
yeah .
i guess she died happy .
she died with her boots on , that's the main thing .
protecting her cub .
she was a real lion , wasn't she?
there at the end .
sure .
a real jungle lion .
a real africa lion .
you finished packing?
your momma's going to be back from the hospital soon .
you can wait for her on the front porch .
stay right here .
don't you move a muscle .
so you all packed?
where's your suitcase?
don't be fresh .
upstairs in my room .
well , let's go get it .
howdy , stan .
you know , you're lucky , stan .
lucky that lion got to you before we did .
i wonder what your uncles are saying to stan .
probably their 'what every boy needs to know about being a man 'speech .
well , i'm glad to see they're making friends .
so , you all set?
let's go .
to make a long story short , stan , you and me , we can be friends ... or we can be enemies .
well , boys , i hope walter wasn't too much trouble .
we managed .
what's going to happen to him?
a man like that's got no business being around your boy .
well , of course not .
what kind of mother would i be?
i'm going to drop him off in las vegas .
i ...
i'll be back for the ... rest of that speech if ...
i'll be here .
good boy .
thanks for the s stories and everything .
it ... it ... it meant an ... an awful , awful lot .
i'm glad .
well , come on , honey .
we're burning daylight .
damn .
she doesn't deserve that kid .
maybe we should get a lawyer .
no judge is going to take a child away from its mother and give it to two old bachelor uncles .
maybe she'll sell him to us .
how much money we got?
hub ... there's nothing we can do .
he's gone .
so where are we going?
i told you , las vegas .
i mean after .
after we drop stan off .
well , honey , stan's going to need a lot of looking after .
walter !
what are you doing? !
oh my god !
walter !
walter !
walter , stop !
stop right there !
what's gotten into you?
oh , honey , are you alright?
you gave me a heart attack .
you're still marrying him after everything .
oh , he's not so bad .
a little rough around the edges , but he can change .
mum !
he says he loves me .
has he hit you yet?
mind your own business !
you always think a new boyfriend solves everything , but you always pick losers , and he's the worst of them all .
walter , i had no choice .
maybe you don't .
what?
mum?
what?
do something for me .
for once .
do something that's best for me .
okay?
salesmen ought to be here in two , three hours .
whoop de doo .
uh huh .
lookie yonder .
okay , if i'm going to live here , there's going to be some conditions .
conditions?
one , you two got to stick around until i'm through with high school at least , preferably college .
you both got responsibilities now ...
pta , boy scouts , little league , the works .
sounds like we don't have much choice .
two , you both got to take better care of yourselves .
more vegetables , less meat .
i wonder if travelling salesmen sell school supplies?
and three , no more dangerous stuff .
no fighting teenagers , no airplanes ...
now wait one minute ...
at least till i'm through with college .
maybe longer .
what do you expect us to die of?
old age?
well ...
welcome home .
hello?
walter?
yes?
this is sheriff grady .
i'm afraid i have some bad news for you .
it's about your two uncles .
i'm sorry , they passed away .
there was an accident ... and it's a blessing that they didn't suffer .
it's a blessing too , in a way , that they went together .
you understand .
i'm over here at your uncles 'place now .
you need to come on over here .
you need to see this for yourself .
walter?
how you doing?
alright .
best i can figure , they were trying to fly through that barn upside down .
had a bunch of reporters out here earlier , even cnn .
i guess any time a biplane ... from the first world war crashes doing acrobatics , being flown by two 90 year old men ... neither one of them with pilot's licenses ... well ... well , they had a good long run , both of them .
they went out with their boots on .
here .
i found their will .
'the kid gets it all .
just plant us in the damn garden ... with the stupid lion . '
hey !
we've got some company .
this is it .
this is where they lived .
it's okay .
come here , buddy .
come here .
look at this .
look at this .
forgive me .
we were in houston when we heard their names on the news , and , well , we just had to come .
when i was a boy , my grandfather told me such stories .
your grandfather?
a very wealthy sheik .
he used to love to tell me stories about his wild youth .
amazing , unbelievable stories all about two brothers ,
hub and garth mccann , the most valiant and brave men , huh?
he called them his 'most honoured adversaries . '
'the only men who ever outsmarted me . '
wait , so you ... you knew these two men?
they ... they raised me .
it's an honour .
nice to meet you .
it's nice to meet you .
wow .
a ha .
i see they spent my grandfather's gold wisely .
yeah .
well , there was this one travelling salesman .
so ... the two men from great grandfather's stories , they really lived?
yeah ... they really lived .
