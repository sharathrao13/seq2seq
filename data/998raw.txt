i'm late , come on , come on .
i need to bounce some ideas off you .
mine are all boring , done it , been there .
hey , ike !
when are you guys gonna stop waking me up every morning?
when your column stops putting me to sleep .
funny , funny .
yo , jonah !
fisher , come on !
are you really not there?
all right , cool .
i'll talk to you later .
excuse me .
i'm thinking of doing an article about limousines .
what do you think about people who've never been in one?
i don't know people like that .
i need someone to bounce some ideas off of and get the juices flowing .
i got one hour , 27 minutes , 52 seconds .
hey , ike !
when are you gonna put me in a column?
when your t shirts stop shrinking .

folks , i got nice shirts here .

i love everybody .

so what's in store for us in tomorrow's column?
i don't know yet .
i'm , uh , kind of a last minute man .
you know , till an hour or two before deadline , i don't get any ideas .
so you get your ideas for your column from life .
start up a conversation with a woman in a bar .
attack her dart playing and try to get a rise out of her ... while you contemplate whether or not she's worth hitting on .
no , i can't hit on you till i get an idea .
wh that's flattering .
no , you don't understand .
i understand .
see , my not responding to you baiting me ... will inspire one of those bitter diatribes you like to write about women .
i don't write bitter diatribes about women .
oh ho .
very often .
i could .
only when the ideas aren't flowing , huh?
it's so nice to meet you , one minute man .
it's last minute man .
whatever .
want to hear something funny?
for a good looking guy , you strike out a lot .
have you noticed that?
i bet it's your ex wife .
excuse me .
i've seen much worse .
no , ike's not here .
i say , i've seen much worse .
i'll tell him when he comes in .
excuse me?
the brush off .
i've witnessed far more ... treacherous and nefarious exits than that .
at least she castigated you in private .
not as private as i thought .
kevin , you got some napkins there?
wiping or writing?
i'll let you know .
they love you .
they hate you .
they're hot .
they're cold .
they're high .
they're up .
they're down .
this is fun making a list with you , but i do have a column to write .
ike .
but you have yet to find a really superb idea .
there's a girl from my hometown that you could write about .
excuse me , but we don't need any ideas .
she likes to dump grooms at the altar .
they call her the " runaway bride .
she's performed the travesty seven or eight times .
turns around , runs like hell .
bolts .
adios .
plows down the aisle , knocking old ladies out of her way ...
like the running of the bulls in pamplona .
and guess what !
she's got the next victim all lined up .
she's turning another body on the spit .
okay , italics , here we go .
today is a day of profound introspection .
i have been accused of using this column ... to direct bitter diatribes at the opposite sex .
this uncomfortable accusation ... has plunged me into at least 15 minutes of serious reflection , from which i have emerged ... with the conclusion that , yes , i traffic in female stereotypes .
but how can one blame me when every time i step out my front door ,
i meet fresh proof that the female archetypes are alive and well .
the mother , the virgin , the whore , the crone .
they're elbowing you in the subway , stealing your cabs , and overwhelming you with perfume in elevators .
but perhaps in fairness to the fairer sex ,
i do need to broaden my horizon and add some new goddesses to the pantheon .
i would like to nominate for deity the cheerleader , the coed ... and the man eater , the last of which concerns me most today .
in ancient greece , this fearsome female was known as erinys , the devouring death goddess .
in india , she is kali , who likes to devour her boyfriend shiva's entrails ... " " while her yoni devours his dot , dot , dot ... never mind .
in indonesia , the bloody jawed man eater is called ragma .
you notice these are all countries without cable .
and in hale , maryland , where she helps run the family hardware store , she is known as miss maggie carpenter , a . k . a . the runaway bride .
what is unusual about miss carpenter ... is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them .
one antique hot water handle with the " hot " still on it .
guaranteed to fit any american standard cast iron tub ... with a four inch center mount made between 1924 and 1938 .
in other words , mr. paxton ,
i think you are out of the doghouse with mrs. paxton .
hallelujah !
i'll see you later .
i'll put it on your charge .
there's a possibility she hasn't seen this yet .
maybe she just hasn't picked up a paper .
know what i mean?
or not .
maggie?
earl , you don't need an air conditioner .
you need an attic fan .
there's more in the back .
hey .
what?
so , mag , you've seen this , huh?
yes , i've seen it .
and it is the rudest , most offensive ... joke anyone has ever played on me !
you guys , how long did this take you?
where did you get it done?
you're both creeps , by the way .
i should " disinvite " you .
maggie , you told us no bachelorette jokes , so we didn't
holy moly .

on the local front , our town of hale , maryland , is still buzzing about the less than flattering article ... about their native daughter , maggie carpenter .
her bridal exploits were taken to task ... by new york columnist ike graham in usa today .
mr. graham called her  [ radio off ]
greetings from the sticks .
perhaps you believe that a rural education is focused mainly ... on hog calling and tractor maintenance rather than reading .
why else would you print a piece of fiction about me and call it fact?
why else would you print a piece of fiction about me and call it fact?
i suppose mr. graham was too busy thinking up slanderous statements ... about how i dump men for kicks ... to bother with something silly like accuracy in reporting .
which is understandable , because with a man eater like me on the loose , who has time to check facts?
hey , frances , lunch today?
no , i'm going to the bank .
sure?
sorry , ike .
all right .
hey .
hey .
i'm going to put in a good word for you .
don't mention my name .
that's why i was surprised to find ...
mr. graham's editor was a woman .
call me a sentimental fool , but i hoped we man eaters could stick together .
ike graham's column on a platter .

there was a , uh , note on the door of the hardware store across the street .
are you a reporter?
what?
it's just been our experience that ... anyone who comes in here with tassels on his loafers ... is a big city reporter wanting to do an interview with maggie .
about her upcoming wedding and all .

you're gonna run again .
and i'm not leaving until you do .

cory flemming?
he's a radio announcer here , isn't he?
yeah , that's right .
have you heard his morning show , " wake up with flemm "?
not yet .
now up , atlantic hotel's lee mistlehorne .
he actually made the all stars in high school .
really?
you must be proud of him .
i didn't really know him back then .
he was actually dating maggie ... at the time .
i mean , he never really they were never gonna ... get engaged or anything , it was just like , you know .
sometimes he'd call her magpie , and it was really irritating .
but i don't know why i'm telling you this .
no , this is good .
he's stealing third !
yes !
safe .
excellent .
yes !
yes !
whoo !
safe !
i love it !
uh huh !
good one !
magpie !
just
excellent !
it's nice that they're ... still friends .
yeah , i mean , that was just a long time ago .
and , you know , it's just
so excuse me .
you all right?
yeah !
that makes it alumni , nine , hale students , eight .

now up for the comets , jordan hill .
you have been here , what , like three minutes?
what did you do to her?
you could just turn that finger around .
excuse me?
oh , cory , cory , cory !
pow , pow , pow , pow .
what is this about?
you know what?
we have all been friends our entire lives .
a type of relationship that you obviously don't understand .

good morning .
do you think i flirt with cory?
good morning to you too .
you look good .
thank you .
do you think i flirt with cory?
yes .
i don't mean to .
i know .
i think sometimes you just sort of ... spaz out with excess flirtatious energy , and it just lands on anything male that moves .
anything male that moves?
as opposed to anything male that doesn't?
well , like certain kinds of coral .
i'm definitely going to have to kill myself today .
why?
because you think i'm all like , " hey , man , check me out .
no , i don't .
i think you're like ...
i'm charming and mysterious in a way that even i don't understand , and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you .
it's very hard to compete with .
especially as ... married women who've lost our mystery .
lost you have you are totally mysterious .
no .
i'm weird .
weird and mysterious are two very different things .
i'm weird .
no , you're quirky .
quirky and weird are two very different things .
peggy , i think there is a distinct possibility ... that i am profoundly and irreversibly screwed up .
despite that ,
i love you and i promise ... to no longer flirt with cory .
maggie , i'm not worried about you and cory , or me and cory , or you being irreversibly screwed up .
maggie , you've been like this since we were kids .
and all i'm thinking is , now that you're aware of it , and that it hurts people's feelings sometimes , maybe it's time to get on with life , and commit to someone of your own ,
like bob , if he's the one .
i know .
is there anything i can do to ... make it up to you?
well , there's always ... the thing that brings warmth to my heart , and that is duckbill platypus .
duckbill that is only funny in like camp birchwood on ...

how does she get all those guys to propose?
she's not that beautiful .

what's your point?
my point is , once again , you're getting it all wrong .
and that's not gonna improve your reputation , and it's not very flattering to me either .
so , i decided that i would help you write the truth .
really?

i've decided to cooperate and let you interview me ...

and for a grand , i will answer all your questions and let you follow me around .

it's not what you would call ethical .

he proposed during the seventh inning stretch ... at an oriole game .

the scoreboard lit up with " marry me , maggie .
it was one of the most wonderful moments of my life .

what do you mean?
it was incredibly romantic .
look , maybe it's just me , but ... if you gotta dress it up like that , it just doesn't ring true .
look , i guarantee there'll be tough times .
i guarantee ...
at some point one or both of us is gonna want to get out of this thing .
but i also guarantee that if i don't ask you to be mine ,
i'll regret it the rest of my life .
because i know in my heart ... you're the only one for me .
i like it .
i'd like it better on a scoreboard .
so , is that what you said when you asked your wife to marry you?
don't look so surprised .
you've got " divorce " written all over you .

no .
i think i said something very eloquent like ,
so , um ,
maybe you and i should , you know
what do you think?
huh?
now , that's romantic .

what went wrong?
i don't know .

maybe you should ask her sometime .
ever thought of that?
even with everything that's happened ,
i have still never been married .
and i still deserve a beautiful dress .

you here on business?
by the way , i saw your lamps .
they're terrific .
yeah , really .
it's something i've always wanted to  [ door closes ]
you could make breaking and entering into a new career .
so , what are you doing here anyway?
i wanted to talk to you ... about why i run , sometimes ride , away from things .
does it matter?
i think so .
when i was walking down the aisle , i was walking toward somebody ... who had no idea who i really was .
and it was only half the other person's fault ... because i had done everything to convince him ... that i was exactly what he wanted .
so , it was good ... that i didn't go through with it because it would've been a lie .
but you
you knew the real me .
yes , i did .
i didn't .
still , i ended up chasing a truck .
i can't , um , do anything about the truck .
but , uh
benedict .
arnold .
i love eggs benedict .
i hate all the other kinds of eggs .
i hate big weddings , everybody staring .
i'd like to get married on a weekday while everybody's at work .
and if i ride off into the sunset , i want my own horse .
should i be writing this down?
and there's something else .
no , you can tell me .
don't
okay .
these are for you .
used  well , they're mine .
i'm turning in my running shoes to you .
this is serious .
and there's one more thing .
i know , the mind reels that there could be more after this .
but , um , if you could just have a seat .
let's just not have that there .
okay .
okay .
oh , no .
my , god , no .
no , no .
don't hide your face .
this happens once in a lifetime , and it's definitely a first for me .
you're not gonna want to miss it , so pay close attention .
i love you , homer eisenhower graham .
will you marry me?
will you marry me?
i gotta think about this a little bit .
good .
i was hoping you would say that .
you were not !
not true .
if you'd said yes , i wouldn't be able to do this next part ... and i've been practicing so let me
okay .
ready?
i'm listening .
i guarantee that we'll have tough times .
and i guarantee that at some point ... one or both of us will want to get out .
but i also guarantee ... that if i don't ask you to be mine ,
i'll regret it for the rest of my life .
'cause i know in my heart ... you're the only one for me .
that's a pretty good speech , maggie .
i borrowed it from this writer i know .
