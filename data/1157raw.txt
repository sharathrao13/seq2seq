dewey , listen to me .
you're a good guitar player , but it's the 20 minute solos .
it's the stage dives .
we're trying to land a record deal here , man , and you're an embarrassment .
read between the lines , theo .
read between the lines !
dewey , man , i hope this doesn't come between us .
like , i care about you , man .
you guys , you know what?
you're nuts .
you're all nuts .
you've been focused so hard on making it , you forgot about one thing .
it's called the music .
and i don't even care .
you know what?
so what .
i don't wanna hang out with wannabe corporate sellouts .
i'm gonna form my own band .
we're gonna start a revolution .
and you're gonna be a funny little footnote on my epic ass .
i feel sorry for you guys .
yes .
yeah , it's a 1968 gibson sg , mint condish .

that's all?
well , that's a mistake .
no , hendrix played this guitar .
hello?
yeah?
ls this mr. schneebly?
no , he's not here .
could you take a message for me?
yeah .
hi .
my name's rosalie mullins .
i'm the principal at horace green prep .
we're having a little emergency .
one of our teachers broke her leg this morning , and all of our subs are already working .
pat wickam at milton prep recommended i call mr. schneebly .
do you know if he's available?
how long is the gig?
excuse me?
how long is the job?
as much as a few weeks , but we need somebody to start immediately .
so how much are we talking here?
we pay our substitutes 650 a week .
now , do you know when mr. schneebly will be back?
hold on a sec .
oh , you know what?
i think he's just coming in right ...
ned , phone !
hello , this is ned schneebly .
pat faxed me your rsum .
it's very impressive .
we've never been in a bind like this before , so thank you so much .
so how's this gonna work?
are you gonna pay me upfront?
i don't understand .
it'd be really great if i could get paid in cash .
oh , well , we don't do that .
when you cut my check , make it payable to dewey finn , for tax reasons .
you can discuss all of that with candace at the end of the day .
when's the end of the day?
we commence at 8 : 15 , school lets out at 3 .
you know what?
do you think i could cut out a little early today?
i got some stuff i gotta do .
it's cool .
i can stay .
mr. schneebly ... ... this is considered the best elementary school in the state , and we maintain that by adhering to a strict code of conduct , faculty included .
don't worry about me .
i'm a hard ass .
lf a kid gets out of line , i got no problem smacking him .
no , no .
we don't use corporal punishment here .
ok , so just verbal abuse?
lf you have any problems with any students , send them to me .
i will do the disciplining .
check .
children .
please take your seats .
i'd like to introduce miss dunham's substitute .
this is mr. schneebly .
why don't you write your name on the board .
yes , i will .
you know what?
why don't you all just call me " mr. s " .
mr. s has never taught here at horace green , so i want you all to be on your best behavior .
so the curriculum is on the desk .
and do you have any questions?
yeah , when's lunch?
the children just had their lunch .
ls there anything else you need?
i'm a teacher .
all i need are minds for molding .
all right , then .
well , thanks again .
you saved the day .
ok , who's got food in here?
you're not gonna get in trouble .
i'm hungry .
you .
what do you got?
that's what i'm talking about .
ok .
teach .
teach .
teach .
all right , look , here's the deal .
i've got a hangover .
who knows what that means?
doesn't that mean you're drunk?
no .
it means i was drunk yesterday .
it means you're an alcoholic .
wrong .
you wouldn't come to work hung over unless you were .
dude , you got a disease .
what's your name?
freddy jones .
freddy jones , shut up .
shut up .
the point is , you all can just chill today .
we'll start on this crapola tomorrow .
yes , tinkerbell?
summer .
as class factotum , first i'd like to just say , welcome to horace green .
thank you .
any questions about our schedule?
because usually now miss dunham teaches vocabulary , then gives us a pop quiz , then splits us up into reading groups .
track b is ...
ok , hey , hey , hey .
miss " dumbum " ain't your teacher today , i am .
and i got a headache and the runs .
so i say , time for recess .
but mr. s , that poster charts everyone's performance .
we get stars when we master the material covered .
how do we get gold stars if we just have recess?
what are these black dots here?
demerits .
what kind of a sick school is this?
as long as i'm here , there will be no grades or gold stars or demerits .
we're gonna have recess all the time .
but miss dunham only gives us recess for 1 5 minutes ...
you're not hearing me , girl .
i'm in charge now , ok?
and i say recess .
go .
play and have fun , now .
nice .
now , you don't want me to have to call your parents , do you?
it's all right , emily , don't cry .
just try to be a bit more conscientious .
would you like a hug?
i'll be good , i swear !
all right , well , that's fine , emily .
you're excused .
yes , we did it .
we did it , come on .
give me some .
give me some .
give me some .
give me some of that .
i will see you cats on the flip flop .
later !
i heard she slipped in the bathroom .
yes , but we've got a wonderful new substitute
who comes very highly recommended .
mr. schneebly?
mr. schneebly?
yeah !
hold on , buddy !
oh , my god .
you've gotta be kidding me .
oh , man , this guy sucks , man .
here , call him .
call him?
yeah , right .
ok .
yes , you can be in my band .
but , ned , no power plays , man .
i've got vision up the butt , so just go with it .
no , thanks .
you're not a teacher , ned .
you're the cross dressing , blood sucking incubus from maggot death .
that's the real you .
dewey , i'm not a satanic sex god anymore .
i'm a working stiff .
and that's cool .
she's got you brainwashed .
i'm working .
that's terrific .
but who are you , babe?
this is my apartment , babe .
not if you don't pay your rent , it's not .
get a job .
i got a job .
i'll have rent by the end of the week .
go tell the mayor .
you got a job .
doing what?
i do what ned does , temping .
i'm not a temp .
i'm a sub .
and soon i'll be a certified teacher .
come on , man !
one show , $20, 000 prize ,
we split it 60/ 40 .
grab your bass and come back to the garage .
i mean , don't you miss rocking out?
lf you think anyone is gonna be in a band with you , you're more delusional than i thought .
dewey , you know , maybe it's time to give up those dreams .
i did , and things are going really great for me .
are you gonna teach us anything or are we just gonna sit here?
just do whatever you want .
i want to learn from my teacher .
besides that .
freddy , what do you like to do?
i don't know , burn stuff?
just go out and have recess .
my parents don't spend $1 5, 000 a year for recess .
you want to learn something?
yes , i do .
you want me to teach you something?
all right , here's a useful lesson for you .
give up .
just quit .
because in this life , you can't win .
yeah , you can try , but in the end , you're just gonna lose , bigtime , because the world is run by the man .
who?
the man .
oh , you don't know the man?
well , he's everywhere .
ln the white house , down the hall .
miss mullins , she's the man .
and the man ruined the ozone , and he's burning down the amazon , and he kidnapped shamu and put her in a chlorine tank .
there used to be a way to stick it to the man .
it was called rock 'n 'roll .
but guess what .
oh , no .
the man ruined that too with a little thing called mtv !
so don't waste your time trying to make anything cool or pure or awesome .
the man's just gonna call you a fat , washed up loser and crush your soul .
so do yourselves a favor and just give up !
mr. schneebly , it's after 1 0 .
on tuesdays , the children have music class now .
right .
ok .
good work , people .
we will continue with our lecture on the man when we return .

you guys , stop messing around .
we've got a lot of work to do .
ok , people , pay attention , because i do not want to have to fail you .
i thought you didn't believe in grades .
of course i believe in grades .
i was testing you .
you passed .
good work , summer .
four and a half stars for you .
now , listen , normal kids would have been stoked to slack off , but not you guys , because you're not normal .
you're special .
because you guys have the right attitude ,
i think it's time we started our new class project .
a science project?
no .
it's called ... " rock band " .
ls this a school project?
yes .
and it's a requirement .
it may sound easy , but nothing could be harder .
it will test your head and your mind and your brain too .
will other schools be competing?
you could say that .
you could say that every school in the state
will be competing for the top prize .
what's the prize?
a win will go on your permanent record .
hello , harvard , yo .
we're not supposed to get started until next quarter , but i think we should get a leg up on the competition , don't you?
i do .
who else wants to go for the gold?
i do .
all right .
but if anyone finds out , we'll be disqualified .
so let's just keep it on the down low , shall we?
can we tell our parents?
no !
trust me .
they don't want to know . keep it zipped .
all right , you guys , let's kick it into overdrive .
what are the rest of us supposed to do?
you just sit back and enjoy the magic of rock .
you mean we're not in the band?
now , hold up now .
just because you're not in the band doesn't mean you're not in the band .
we need backup singers .
who can sing?
you , sing .
the sun'll come out tomorrow yes .
bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow
stop .
you've got it , and i don't even know what it is , but you've got it .
and that's why you're in the band .

i'm not cool enough .
people in bands are cool .
i'm not cool .
dude , you are cool .
the way you play .
why do you say you're not cool?
nobody ever talks to me .
well , those days are over , buddy .
you could be the ugliest sad sack on the planet , but if you're in a rocking band , you're the cat's pajamas .
you're the bee's knees .
bee's knees?
yeah , the bee's knees .
you'll be the most popular guy in school .

let's get rocking !
morning , summer .
groupie?
what's the matter?
you want me to be a groupie?
groupie is an important job .
i researched groupies on the lnternet .
they're sluts .
they sleep with the band .
no .
that's not true .
they're like cheerleaders .
i don't want to be a cheerleader .
look , my mother is a room parent , and she's not gonna be happy when she hears about this .
ok , i didn't want to say this in front of the other kids , but i made a special position just for you .
it's the most important job of all .
band manager .
band manager?
oh , yeah .
what's that?
i'm gonna be busy rocking out , so it's up to you to make sure everyone is doing their job .
summer , you're in charge of everything .
ok .
ok .
all right , look alive .
listen up .
first thing you do when you start a band ...
mr. schneebly , before we start , shouldn't i first take attendance?
ok , fine .
ok .
now .
michelle?
here .
ok .
and marco?
here .
ok .
summer .
here .
let's see .
tomika?
we're all here .
the first thing you do when you start a band is talk about your influences .
that's how you figure out what kind of band to be .
so who do you like?
blondie?
christina aguilera .
who?
no .
come on .
what?
you , shortstop .
puff daddy .
wrong .
billy?

jimmy page , robert plant?
ring any bells?
what about sabbath?
ac/ dc?
m0torhead?
oh , what do they teach in this place? !
summer , you're the class whatever , go to the board .
factotum .
factotor " .
new schedule .
8 : 1 5 to 1 0 , rock history .
ten to 1 1 , rock appreciation and theory .
then band practice till the end of the day .
what about math?
no .
not important .
world cultures?
not important .
we need to focus .
don't you wanna win this contest?
it's prestigious .
how are we being graded in all this?
since i'm band manager , and i have the most responsibility , wouldn't ...?
summer , if you grade grub , i will send you back to the first grade .
you got it?
back to your seat now .
fine .
what are we gonna play?
you don't have to worry about that .
we have awesome material , which i wrote .
let's hear it .
what?
let's hear your song .
you wanna hear my song?
i'll play you my song , if you want .
the thing is , i just want you to keep in mind ,
i wrote it in , like , 1 5 minutes .
it's not done .
you might not like ...
just play the song , schneebly .
ok , i will sing it for you , but let me just get in the zone .
i was not planning on unveiling it , but i will sing it .
tip of the tongue , teeth and the lips .
ok .
it starts off ... ... a dark stage , and then a beam of light , and you can see me and my guitar .
ln the end of time
there was a man who knew the road
and the writing was written on the stone
and then a thin layer of fog comes in around my ankles .
roadies , that means dry ice .
we're gonna talk about this later .
ln the ancient time
an artist led the way
but no one seemed to understand
chimes , freddy .
ln his heart he knew
the artist must be true
but the legend of the rent was way past due
and then , katie , you come in with the bass .
well , you think you'll be just fine without me , but you're mine y ou think you can kick me out of the band
and then , zack , you come in with a face melter .
ok?
well , there's just one problem there
the band is mine
how can you kick me out of what is mine?
and then ...
hawaii five o.
you ever see that show?
ok , well , there's a drum solo in it that goes : y ou're not hardcore
unless you live hardcore
well , you're not hardcore no , you're not hardcore
unless you live hardc unless you live hardcore
but the legend of the rent was way hardcore
boom !
big old explosion .
some , like , confetti comes down .
that's all i got so far .
it's a work in progress .
i liked it , mr. schneebly .
i thought it was really catchy .
thank you .
mr. s?
we came up with some names for the band .
yeah?
hit me .
the bumblebees?
no , it's sissy .
the koala bears?
what are you talking about?
it's sissy .
i need to speak with principal mullins .
hey , miss mullins .
hello .
how's it going?
how about " pig rectum "?
michelle !
it's a science project .
listen , ros , i was thinking about organizing a field trip .
what do you think about that?
well ... ... substitutes , as a rule , do not organize field trips .
but i figure i'm gonna be here for a while .
well , that remains to be seen .
have you met our other teachers?
no .
but the kids could learn by getting out of the classroom .
it's more complicated than that .
there's safety issues .
parents need to be notified .
it's against school policy .
mr. s , i have a lot of ideas .
how about everyone in magenta with beads and sequins?
billy , i'm talking to principal mullins .
oh , hi .
william .
i'll make up some samples .
everyone , this is ned schneebly .
he's covering for gail .
gabe green .
he teaches second .
jane lemmons , fourth .
bob's our p. e. teacher .
roberta's our librarian .
how do you do?
care to join us , mr. schneebly?
yeah .
did i say that correctly?
schneebly "?
actually , it's " schnayblay " .
we were just discussing testing .
which test do you find most effective , the tass or the wilson binet?
i say no testing , and i will tell you why , joe .
gabe .
gabe .
i believe ... ... that the children are the future .
now , you can teach them well , but you have gotta let them lead the way .

that's it .
you own the universe .

that's good .
all right .
everybody , class has begun .
and you know what?
you guys have been doing real good in here .
lf i was gonna give you a grade , i'd give you an a.

frankie?
scoring chicks?
no .
see?
no .
eleni?
getting wasted .
no .
come on .
no .
leonard .
sticking it to the man?
yes !
but you can't just say it , man .
you gotta feel it in your blood and guts .
lf you wanna rock , you gotta break the rules .
you gotta get mad at the man , and right now i'm the man .
that's right , i'm the man , and who's got the guts to tell me off?
who's gonna tell me off?
shut the hell up , schneebly !
that's it , freddy .
that's it .
who can top him?
get out of here , stupid ass .
yes , alicia .
you're a joke .
you're the worst teacher i've ever had .
summer , that is great .
i like the delivery .
i felt your anger .
thank you .
you're a fat loser , and you have body odor .
all right .
all right .

so , what would you say to a bully?
zack?
i don't know .
now , come on .
lf someone was in your grill ,
what would you say?

what would you say?
" step off "?

oh , yeah .
i was this close to getting a chair on the polish philharmonic , and i nailed the audish , but i didn't get it .
guess who did .
yo yo ma's cousin , little " nepotis " .
anyway , i just decided to give up and become a teacher , because those that can't do , teach .
and those that can't teach , teach gym .
am i right?
i'm just joshing .
cute .
hey , mr. schneebly .
hey , zack .
that was a really cool lesson today .
well , thanks , dude .
i'll see you back in class .

no , no , no .
i'm just saying , name two great chick drummers .
sheila e?

she can't drum .
she's better than you .
at least she has rhythm .
freddy , where are your sleeves?
and what have you done to your hair?
it's called punk .
well , it's not school uniform .
miss mullins , you're the man .
thank you , frankie .
good morning .
parents 'night is coming up , and i expect everyone to have a presentation .
what?
hot !
you ok?
it's all right .
as you know , it is the most important event of the year .
the parents scrutinize our every move , so i find it's best to over prepare .
right?
the best defense is a good offense .
and , roberta , now that i see you ...
hey , is she always like that?
oh , yeah .
except for the time she got drunk at the alumni dinner .
you should have seen that .
she got up on the table and did a stevie nicks impersonation .
and she wasn't bad .
remember , she took up the tablecloth and whirled around with it? ... that had been on the turkey tray that were touched over onto the peanut butter and jelly tray .
now , i know that you know that this is a severe problem .
clear .
come on .
go , go , go !
all right , you guys .
ls everybody ready?
yeah .
strap in .
let's do this .
oh , dude , cool .

i don't think i can sing .
what are you talking about?
come here .
so , tomika , what's going on?
what do you mean , you can't sing?
i don't feel good .
i feel sick .
just let alicia and marta do it .
no .
they can't sing like you can .
i need you .
what is it?
are you nervous?
yeah?
why?
what are you afraid of?
they're gonna laugh at me .
why would they laugh at you?
i don't know .
because i'm fat .
tomika ...
hey , you've got something everybody wants .
you've got talent , girl .
you have an incredible voice .
i'm not just saying that .
you heard of aretha franklin , right?
ok , she's a big lady .
but when she sings , she blows people's minds .
everybody wants to party with aretha !
and you know who else has a weight issue?
who?
me .
but once i get up on stage , start doing my thing , people worship me .
because i'm sexy and chubby , man .
why aren't you on a diet?
because i like to eat .
ls that such a crime?
you know what?
that's not even the point .
the thing is , you're a rock star now .
all you gotta do is rock your heart out .
people are gonna dig you , i swear .
let's just show them what we got .
what do you say?
ok .
thank you .
let's rock .

freddy , this is your teacher talking !
hey , mr. s. oh , man .
what's going on here?
nothing .
just chilling .
freddy , get out of that van this instant .
see you guys .
you think you're pretty funny , partying with an innocent little kid?
dude , we're just chilling .
that kid's 1 0 years old .
he looks up to you .
you are setting an example for him , so start acting like a responsible adult !
that goes for all of you guys .
don't make me come back here .
come on .
let's go .
what's the big deal?
you're acting like my mom .
what's the big deal?
you had me worried sick .
i was hanging with real rockers .
they aren't real rockers .
they're posers .
rock ain't about getting loaded and being a jerk .
now , this is serious business here .
we've got a mission .
putting on a great show is the most important thing .
one great rock show can change the world .
do you understand me?
yeah .
lf you ever scare me like that again , so help me ,
i will send a note home to your parents .
let's go .
all right , you guys .
just wait here for a minute .
hey , man , check this place out .
yeah .
it's cool .
hey , what's going on?
where is everyone?
auditions are over .

you haven't heard our band .
the bill is full .
we're overbooked .
let us play one song .
we're here .
we're ready .
who are they?
my band . kids? ls this some kind of gimmick?
it's not a gimmick .
they're kids , but they're awesome .
thanks for coming down , but you're really not what we're looking for .
these kids have worked their fingers to the bone just to play one song for you , so sit down , shut up and listen !
sheila , call security .
oh , god .
it was just a warm up .
we'll still compete against the other schools .
what?
this is the gig , summer .
this was our woodstock .
then we shouldn't take no for an answer .
don't take no for an answer?
he was gonna call the fuzz .
would you just listen to me?
i have an idea .
hi there .
hi .
it's ok .
it's cool .
i just wanted to say , i'm really sorry .
i shouldn't have barged in here .
it wasn't fair to you or the kids , especially after what they've been through .
god , i feel like a jerk .
god .
i'm taking them back to the hospital .
just wanted to say i'm sorry .
that's fine .
see , i volunteer down at st. margarita's , in the children's wing ,
teaching music .
really?
that's nice .
that's very nice .
actually , it isn't , because i totally screwed up .
i told the kids if they practiced , they'd get into battle of the bands .
what did you tell them that for?
i don't know .
i just ...
i wanted to give them something to look forward to , to keep their spirits up .
look at them .
they're terminal .
every last one of them .
jeez .
yeah , and all they wanted to do before they bit the dust was play battle of the bands .
what do they all have?
it's a ...
it's a rare blood disease .
stick it to da man niosis " .
what's that?
i've never heard of it .
you're lucky .
because it's hell .
wow .
we're on the bill .
yes !
cut it out !
you're dying , remember?
get in the van .
we come from the land of the ice and snow
from the midnight sun where the hot springs blow
the hammer of the gods
summer , you get an a plus and 50 gold stars .
i didn't do it for the grade .
give me some of that .
yeah !
yeah !
and it was so scary .
hey , mr. s?
we have a name for the band .
hit me .
the school of rock .
the school of rock .
and we shall teach rock 'n 'roll to the world .
there's no way you can stop
the school of rock y eah
stop .
we have a red alert .
it's mullins .
let's go .
come on .
to your positions .
to your positions !
come on , come on .
and therefore , e=mc2 .
oh , miss mullins .
come in .
i'm sorry to interrupt , but miss lemmons said she heard music
coming from the classroom .
music?
music .
i haven't heard any music .
you know what?
miss lemmons must be on crack , right , kids?
well ...
well , what's that?
oh , that .
yeah .
we were singing .
we were singing and learning .
we were learning in sing song .
one of your methods?
yeah .
i find it's helpful when you're teaching the subjects that are the boring subjects .
well , you don't mind if i just sit in on your class this afternoon , do you?
no .
no .
come on back this afternoon .
it is the afternoon .
i meant now .
so please just continue with your method .
yeah .
ok .
math is a wonderful thing
math is a really cool thing
so get off your " ath " let's do some math
math , math , math , math , math
three minus four is ...
negative one .
that's right .
and six times a billion is ...
six billion?
nailed it .
and 54 is 45 more than ...
what is the answer , marta?
nine .
no , it's eight
no , it's nine y es , i was testing you it's nine
and that's a magic number
i'm very happy that you're able to extend your stay , but i must say , i find your methods of teaching very unusual .
well , i did study with dr. errol von straussenburgerbecken .
who?
oh , you don't know him?
oh , he's , like , one of the leading leaders in ... unusual methods .
actually , he's how i was appointed to the presidential council for experimental educationers .
that sounds very impressive , but we're not interested in experimental education here .
so if from now on you could just stick to the curriculum , that would be great .
yes .
right .
thank you .
ros?
yes?
do you know ,
i would really love to talk some more about your philosophy on teaching .
do you think maybe we could grab some coffee?
you want to go get some coffee with me?
yeah .
i really would .
you're sure you don't have coffee?
i'm quite sure .
well , i've never been here before .
i've never been to this side of town before , in fact .
so i have been ...
well , i've been ...
i've been dying to ask you something , mr. schneebly .
please , call me " dewey " .
dewey?
ned .
call me " ned " .
i was thinking of my other name .
my middle name .
yeah .
well , ned ...
... in your experience , how does horace green compare to the other schools that you've taught at?
oh , your school is the best .
you're just saying that .
i'm not .
you know that kids at other schools just have fun all the time?
they run around .
there's no discipline .
they're happy .
it's anarchy .
this is the best school i have ever teached at .
i swear .
i'll drink to that .
stay there .
i'm gonna put on some music .
i love this song .
really?
yes .
stevie nicks .
yeah .
stevie !
you know , she came to town , and she did a concert ,
and she was just so ... wild .
i know .
oh , man .
oh , my gosh .
she put on the best show ever .
she's better live than she is on the album .
you know what i mean?
yes , yes .
oh , my gosh , no comparison .
yeah .
you know what?
oh , man , i would love to take the kids to a concert .
concert?
yeah .
there's one at the end of the month .
the philharmonic .
they do classics .
they do beethoven , mozart ... ... enya , that kind of stuff .
but you have a policy about field trips .
would it be educational?
would it be educational?
it could be very educational .
maybe we can make an exception .
yes !
sings a song sounds like she's singing
ooh , baby , ooh , ooh
i'm holding you to that .
make an exception .
ooh , baby , ooh , said ooh
tomorrow
keeping your head over water making a wave when you can
temporary layoff good time
easy credit rip off good time
scratching and surviving good time
would you stop that , please?
yeah .
i had a really nice time .
yeah , ditto .
this is the first time a teacher has asked me
to do anything outside of school .
no way .
it's ...
it's true .
ln six years .
well , you know ,
i think it might be one of those things where people are intimidated .
lntimidated?
they hate me .
no .
they don't .
yes , they do .
they sure do .
i can see .
i wasn't always like this .
i wasn't always wound this tight .
there was a time when i was fun .
i was funny .
i was .
but you can't be funny and be the principal of a prep school .
no , you cannot , because when it comes to their kids , these parents , they have no sense of humor .
lf anything goes wrong , it's my head .
it's my head in the smasher .
these parents will come down on me like a nuclear bomb .
i can't make a mistake .
i gotta be perfect .
and that pressure has turned me into one thing that i never wanted to be .
a bitch .
no .
you're not .
yes , i am .
i am a big one .
well , i don't think so .
i think you're pretty cool .
really?
no .
yeah .
you're way cool .
really?
ok , drums?
house . keyboards?
house .
amps?
all right .
cable?
got them .
all right .
guitar?
yes .
mr. s. yeah?
what do you think?
i don't know .
i ...
they might be a little distracting .
it's glitter rock and it's glam and it's fabulous .
billy , it's just not the right style .
you're gonna talk to me about style?
you can't dress yourself .
look at that bow tie .
don't talk about my bow tie .
you know what , i give up .
they can just wear their uniforms .
that's not a bad idea .
not a bad idea?
i was kidding .
excuse me .
hey , hey .
what is that?
what's what?
what are you playing?
just something i wrote .
you wrote a song?
well , let's hear it .
no , it's not that good .
come on , i want to hear it , kurt cobain .
ok , but i'm not much of a singer .
it's all right .
baby , we were making straight a's
but we were stuck in a dumb daze
don't take much to memorize your lies
feel like i've been hypnotized
wait .
you wrote that?
you wrote that?
that's it .
guys , rock 'n 'roll positions .
what are you doing?
we're gonna learn your song .
but why?
that's what bands do , man .

don't take much to memorize your lies
and if you wanna be the teacher's pet
baby , you just better forget it
rock is the reason rock is the rhyme know what would be better?
rock got no reason , rock got no rhyme .
can we try that?
try that .
can we take it from the chorus?
one , two , three , four .
one , two , three .
and if you wanna be the teacher's pet
baby , you just better forget it
rock got no reason rock got no rhyme y ou'd better get me to school on time and if you wanna be the teacher's pet
baby , you just better forget it
rock got no reason rock got no rhyme y ou better get me to school on time
i'm gonna solo there if it's cool with you .
all right .
you can solo later .
ok .
let me rock a solo there , i can feel it .
tomorrow is the big day , so get your rest .
no late parties , drinking tequila and trying to get lucky .
chances like this do not come around every day .
you've played hard in here , and i am proud of every last stinking one of you .
let's just give this everything we got .
we may fall on our faces , but if we do , we will fall with dignity !
with a guitar in our hands and rock in our hearts !
we roll tonight to the guitar bite ,
and for those about to rock ...
... l salute you .
ros , excuse me , wanted to remind you about our field trip tomorrow .
what field trip?
the educational concert .
oh , i forgot about that .
i don't know , school policy is very difficult to get around .
but you said we could make an exception , and the kids are excited about hearing some mozart .
i know , but the preparations , there's not enough time .
i don't know anything about it .
where is it?
i've got it all covered .
what's going on , are you mad at me?
no , no , ned .
i'm sorry , i'm just a little stressed out because it's parents 'night tonight .
hey , it's all gonna be fine .
ned , would you mind coming with me tonight to parents 'night?
it wouldn't be a date or anything .
i get nervous around the parents , and there's something about you that makes me feel more relaxed .
you know what , that sounds so great , ros , but ...
but what?
i wasn't planning on going tonight .
you have to .
you're their teacher .
you have to give the presentation .
oh , yeah , yeah .
no , i got you .
i'm ready for that .
so we'll go together?
ok .
why don't you pick me up at , say , 6 : 40 .
done .
all right .
ok .
what are you all dressed up for?
i got a hot date .
that's weird .
i got a check from horace green prep for $1 , 200 .
i've never worked there .
what are you doing?
calling the school .
hi , this is ned schneebly ...
dewey?
what's going on?
i told them 1 5 times , make it out to cash !
dewey?
i did something bad , ned .
no .
yeah .
they called for a sub .
i said i was you , to make some money .
but then i got there , and the kids , they rock , man .
she thought she was too fat , so they were dying , and the principal got drunk .
now we're playing battle of the bands .
it's the coolest thing !
one day .
then i will come clean .
i'll tell everyone it was my fault .
you'll be fine .
one day !
ned , home .
don't say anything to her .
she'll blow everything .

science ...
what else?
geography , history ,
latin , spanish , french ,

anyway , all the stuff you want your kids to know , it's been covered , ok?
so ... ... it was great to meet you all , and drive safe .
excuse me .
since you started , all my son talks about is music .
he says he wants to be a musician .
ls this your influence?
why has my daughter become obsessed with david geffen?
and how is this homework?
ok , see , i would like to tell you about what we've been doing in here , but there's such a thing as teacher student confidentiality , and i don't want to be in breach of educational law because i could be dismembered by the teacher's union .
so ...
you expect us to believe this garbage?
mr. s , don't you think you should tell them about the project?
what project?
our class project .
every school in the state is competing .
competing?
it's not till next quarter , but mr. s wanted us to get a head start .
well , what's the project , summer?
it's prestigious .
a win will go on our permanent record .
you might as well tell them , mr. schneebly .
ok , look .
i've gotten to know your kids the past few weeks .
they're awesome .
zack is an insane guitarist .
he's the next hendrix , and he's 1 0 .
and gordon here , he's a genius !
he did a whole professional light show on his computer in three days .
and ...
and marta here , she's ...
she can hit an a above high c.
did you know that?
because that's tough .
not many singers can do that .
and ...
summer is gonna be the first woman president of the united states .
she could run this year .
i would vote for her .
look , they're just really cool kids .
lf they were mine , i would be so proud .
and i am proud , just to even know them .
and ...
sir , can i see you in the hall for a moment?
let me just say a couple more things .
what's going on?
what's happening?
apparently , that man is not ned schneebly .
what?
what?
this man is ned schneebly .
he's not even a teacher .
you called the cops?
she did .
she got it out of me .
sorry .
you're apologizing to him?
sorry .
ned .
ned , is this true?
who are you?
my name is dewey finn .
and , no , i'm not a licensed teacher , but i have been touched by your kids .
and i'm pretty sure i've touched them .
what?
oh , my god .
i have nothing to say to you .
me either .
ok .
i'm going to bed .
it's one thing to throw your life away , but to put ned in jeopardy is selfish .
you told me to be like ned and get a job .
i told you to be like ned , i didn't tell you to be ned .
you're not gonna apologize?
you apologize for calling the cops .
i didn't murder anybody .
i wanted to play a great show .
i was this close .
shut up !
shut up !
shut up !
would you both just cut it out for one second?
look , i'm sorry , dude .
i was desperate .
it was easy for you to give up music .
it ain't easy for me .
it wasn't easy for me .
i miss it .
well , then why'd you give it up?
because i couldn't keep kidding myself anymore .
you can blame it all on bad luck , but in the end , maybe we just weren't that good .
sometimes you gotta know when to quit .
right , maybe i suck .
that's not what i said .
well , music is my life , man .
what do you want me to do?
i don't know , but ... ... l think it's time you moved out .
sorry .
so his name wasn't mr. schneebly?
no , it was , like , dewey something .
what about the project?
wake up , marco , there was no project .
he wanted us to play a show so we could make money .
i can't believe we weren't graded .
why are you bummed?
we had a three week vacation .
it was a waste of time , but it was better than school .
it was not a waste of time .
yeah , that's what it was .
you're an idiot .
shut up .
no , you shut up .
you want to go?
touch him , i'll shove those sticks down your throat .
mr. s was cool .
we worked too long and too hard not to play the show .
ok , so what are we supposed to do?
we get out of here and play the damn show .
how could you let our kids be exposed to this impostor?
do you just let anyone teach here?
i pay $1 5, 000 ...
let me assure you that nothing is more important to us than for you to feel your children are in a safe and secure environment .
ok , we're all here .
where's mr. schneebly?
he didn't tell you?
he's at home .
we need to pick him up .
let's go , hurry .
excuse me .
just one second , please .
excuse me .
wait a minute .
where are you going?
we want some answers , now !
just one second !
where did they go?
help !
children?
wake up .
how'd you guys get in here?
front door was open .
why aren't you in school?
we did what you said .
we stuck it to the man .
forget about what i told you .
look , i'm a loser , ok?
you listen to my advice , you'll end up like me , with nothing .
come on , man , quit goofing around .
this is serious business .
we're on a mission .
one great show can change the world .
look out the window .
mr. s !
come down !
come on !
no way .
that is so punk rock .
the dining room table seats 1 4 , with no inserts ...

but why?
i mean , really?
yes .
the thing is , you guys , i ain't that good .
i'm not .
i can admit it .
but you're 1 0 , and you're better than me .
your song rocks harder , so let's play it .
but you know what?
that's just one guy's opinion .
this ain't my band , it's our band .
we all have a say .
we haven't practiced that one as much .
i mean , we might not win .
hey , we didn't come here to win .
we came here to play one great show .
and on zack's song , you guys really rock .
you know my vote , who else is with me?
all right , let's pray .
god of rock , thank you for this chance to kick ass .
we are your humble servants .
please give us the power to blow minds with our high voltage rock .
ln your name , we pray .
amen .
amen .
