i never knew the old vienna before the war ... with its strauss music , its glamor and easy charm .
constantinople suited me better .
i really got to know it in the classic period of the black market .
we'd run anything if people wanted it enough and had the money to pay .
of course , a situation like that does tempt amateurs ... but , you know , they can't stay the course like a professional .
now the city , it's divided into four zones , you know , each occupied by a power the american , the british , the russian and the french .
but the center of the city , that's international , policed by an international patrol , one member of each of the four powers .
wonderful !
what a hope they had , all strangers to the place ... and none of them could speak the same language , except a sort of smattering of german .
good fellows , on the whole .
did their best , you know .
vienna doesn't really look any worse than a lot of other european cities .
bombed about a bit .
oh , wait .
i was gonna tell you about holly martins , an american , came all the way here to visit a friend of his .
the name was lime .
harry lime .
now , martins was broke , and lime had offered him some sort of a job .
anyway , there he was , poor chap , happy as a lark and without a cent .
passport , please .
oh .
what's the purpose of your visit here?
a friend offered me a job .
where are you staying?
with him .
15 stiffgasse .
his name?
lime .
harry lime .
okay .
thought he'd be here to meet me .
??
speak english?
english?
a little , little .
ten minutes too late .
already gone .
who?
mmm , his friends and , uh , no
uh , coffin .
coffin?
mr. lime's .
an accident .
knocked over by a car , here in front of the house .
have seen it myself .
killed at once , immediately .
already in hell ... or in heaven .
sorry for the gravediggers .
hard work .
it is frost .
can you tell me , uh , who's the
a fellow called lime .
like a lift to town?
i've got a car here .
thanks .
my name's calloway .
martins .
you a friend of lime?
yeah .
been here long?
no .
you've had a bit of a shock , haven't you?
you could do with a drink .
could you buy me one?
of course .
thanks .
schmolka?
i guess nobody knew harry like he did , or like i did .
how long ago?
back in school .
i was never so lonesome in my life till he showed up .
when did you see him last?
september , '39 .
when the business started?
mm hmm .
see much of him before that?
once in a while .
best friend i ever had .
that sounds like a cheap novelette .
well , i write cheap novelettes .
i'm afraid i've never heard of you .
what's your name again?
holly martins .
no , sorry .
you ever hear of the lone rider of santa fe?
can't say that i have .
death at double x ranch?
uh , raunch .
nope .
he must've known i was broke .
he even sent me an airplane ticket .
it's a shame .
what?
him dying like that .
best thing that ever happened to him .
what are you trying to say?
he was about the worst racketeer in this city .
policeman , huh?
come on , have another drink .
no , i never did like policemen .
i have to call them sheriffs .
ever seen one?
pin it on a dead man .
some petty racket with gasoline or something .
just like a cop .
you're a real cop , i suppose .
it wasn't petrol .
so it wasn't petrol .
so it was tires or saccharin or
why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?
well , you could say that murder was part of his racket .
it's all right , paine .
he's only a scribbler with too much drink in him .
take mr. holly martins home .
holly martins , sir?
the , uh , the writer?
the author of death at double x ranch?
listen , callaghan  calloway .
i'm english .
you're not going to close your files at a dead man's expense .
so you're going to find me the real criminal?
sounds like one of your stories .
when i'm finished with you , you'll leave vienna .
here's some army money .
it should see you through tonight at sacher's hotel , if you don't drink too much in the bar .
we'll keep a seat for you on tomorrow's plane .
please be careful , sir .
up we come .
written anything lately?
take him to sacher's .
don't hit him again if he behaves .
and you go carefully there .
it's a military hotel .
i'm so glad to have met you , sir .
i've read quite a few of your books .
auf wiedersehen .
i like a good western .
that's what i like about them .
you can pick them up and put them down anytime .
oh , mr. hartman?
yes , sir?
mr. calloway said this gentleman's got to have a room for the night .
passport , please .
can't very well introduce you to everybody .
would you mind filling this in?
mr. crabbin .
what is it , sergeant?
mr. holly martins , the author .
who?
thought you might be interested .
never heard of him .
he's very good , sir .
i've read quite a few of his books .
author?
martins?
thank you , sergeant .
mr. martins?
my name's crabbin .
i represent the c. r. s. of g. h. q.
you do?
yes .
cultural reeducation section .
propaganda .
very important in a place like this .
we do a little show each week .
last week we had hamlet .
the week before we had ... something .
the striptease , sir .
yes , the hindu dancers .
thank you .
this is the first opportunity of making an american author welcome .
welcome?
i'll tell you what , mr. martins .
on wednesday night , we're having a little lecture on the contemporary novel .
thought perhaps you'd like to speak .
they wouldn't know me .
nonsense .
your novels are very popular here .
aren't they , sergeant?
very popular .
are you staying long?
how long can one stay here on this stage money?
listen , mr. martins , if you'd agree to be our guest ,
we'd be delighted to have you .
would you?
as long as you care to stay .
he's due to leave tomorrow .
have you got a toothache .
number 8 , mr. martins .
come upstairs a moment .
i know a very good dentist .
i don't need a dentist .
somebody hit me , that's all .
goodness .
we must report that .
were they trying to rob you?
oh , just a soldier .
i was trying to punch his major in the eye .
a major?
were you really?
heard of harry lime?
i've heard of him , but i didn't exactly know him .
i was going to stay with him , but he died thursday .
goodness , that's awkward .
ls that what you say to people after death?
goodness , that's awkward?
mr. martins?
excuse me .
telephone .
who is it?
baron kurtz .
must be some mistake .
yes?
i was a friend of harry lime .
i'd very much like to meet you , baron .
come around .
austrians aren't allowed in your hotel .
couldn't we meet at the mozart cafe?
where?
just around the corner .
how will i know you?
i'll carry a copy of one of your books .
harry gave it to me .
be there in a moment .
wait a minute .
lf i do this lecture business , you'll put me up here a while?
certainly .
it's a deal .
did you ever read the lone rider of santa fe?
no , not that one .
it's a story about a man who hunted down a sheriff who was victimizing his best friend .
seems exciting .
it is .
i'm gunning just the same way for your major callaghan .
sounds anti british , sir .
baron kurtz?
mr. martins?
delighted to meet you .
come , let's sit down here .
what would you like?
tea?
coffee?
coffee .
it's wonderful how you keep the tension .
tension?
suspense .
you really liked it?
at the end of every chapter you are left guessing .
so , you were a friend of harry's?
i think his best .
except you , of course .
the police have a crazy notion that he was mixed up in some sort of a racket .
everyone in vienna is .
we all sell cigarettes and that kind of thing .
i tell you , i've done things that would have seemed unthinkable before the war .
once when i was hard up , i sold some tires on the black market .
i wonder what my father would have said .
i'm afraid the police meant more than that .
they get rather absurd ideas sometimes .
he's somewhere now he won't mind about that .
even so , i'm not going to leave it at this .
would you help me?
i wish i could .
but , you know , i am an austrian .
i have to be careful with the police .
i'm afraid i can't help you .
except with advice , of course .
advice .
we came out of his place like this ... and were walking this way .
a friend of his called to him from over there .
harry went across , and from up there came the truck .
it was just about here .
here?
yes .
his friend and i picked him up , carried him across over here .
it was a terrible thing .
terrible .
we laid him down just about here .
and this is where he died .
even at the end , his thoughts were of you .
what did he say?
i can't remember the exact words , holly .
i may call you holly , mayn't i?
he always called you that to us .
he was anxious i should look after you when you arrived , to see that you got safely home , tickets , you know , and all that .
but he said he died instantaneously .
well , he died before the ambulance could reach us .
well , there was only you and this friend of his .
uh , who was he?
a romanian .
mr. popescu .
i'd like to talk to him .
h he has left vienna .
uh , excuse me .
yes?
did you know mr. lime well?
mr. lime?
yes .
you remember me .
u upstairs .
yes , i remember you .
who used to visit mr. lime?
visit?
eh [ speaking german ]
what did he say?
he says he doesn't know everybody .
excuse me .
who was at the funeral besides you?
only his doctor , dr. winkel .
wasn't there a girl there?
some girl of the josefstadt theater .
you know what harry was .
you oughtn't to speak to her .
it would only cause her pain .
not necessarily .
she'd probably want to help .
what's the good of another postmortem?
suppose you dig up something discreditable to harry?
would you give me your address?
i live in the russian sector .
but you'll find me at the casanova club every night .
one has to work the best way one can , you know .
what's the name of this girl?
i don't know .
i don't think i ever heard it .
you did mention the theater .
josefstadt .
but i still think it won't do harry any good .
you'd do better to think of yourself .
i'll be all right .
of course .
i'm so glad i've met you .
a master of suspense !
such a good cover , i think .
number 8 , please .
mr. calloway's compliments .
here's the ticket for the plane tomorrow .
tell the major i won't need it .
oh , porter , order me a ticket tonight for the josefstadt theater .
ah , mr. martins !
good evening , mr. crabbin .
he said i was to drive you to the airfield or the bus , whichever you prefer .
didn't you hear mr. crabbin offer me the hospitality of the h. q. b. m. t.?
i was a friend of harry lime .
afterwards .
uh , miss schmidt?
oh , come in .
thank you .
sit down .
i enjoyed the play very much .
danke .
guten nacht .
guten nacht .
you were you were awfully good .
do you understand german?
no , l excuse me .
i could follow it fine .
oh , yes .
perhaps harry told you about me .
my name is holly martins .
no , he never told me about his friends .
oh .
would you like some tea?
someone threw me this packet last week .
thank you .
sometimes the british do instead of flowers , you know , on the first night .
that was a bouquet from an american .
would you rather have whiskey?
oh , tea's fine .
good .
i wanted to sell it .
oh , there is some tea left .
had you known him some time?
yes .
i wanted to talk to you no , thank you .
i wanted to talk to you about him .
there's nothing really to talk about , is there?
nothing .
well , i saw you at the funeral .
i'm so sorry .
i didn't notice much .
you were in love with him , weren't you?
i don't know .
how can you know a thing like that afterwards?
i don't know anything anymore , except i want to be dead too .
some more tea?
no , no tea .
would you like a cigarette?
oh , american .
thank you .
i like them .
i was talking to another friend of harry's , a baron kurtz .
do you know him?
no .
he's got a little dog .
oh , yes , yes .
don't understand what harry saw in a fellow like that .
that was the man who brought me some money when harry died .
he said harry had been anxious at the last moment .
hmm .
he said he remembered me too .
seems to show he wasn't in much pain .
dr. winkel told me that .
dr. winkel?
who's he?
a doctor harry used to go to .
he was passing just after it happened .
his own doctor?
yes .
well , were you at the inquest?
yes .
they said it wasn't the driver's fault .
harry had often said what a careful driver he was .
he was harry's driver?
mm hmm .
well , uh , i don't get it .
all of them there !
uh , kurtz , this romanian , uh , popescu , his own driver knocking him over , his own doctor just passing by .
no strangers there at all .
i know .
i've wondered about it a hundred times , if it really was an accident .
what difference does it make?
he's dead , isn't he?
but if it wasn't an  [ woman ]
frau schmidt !
i must hurry .
they don't like us to use the lights .
the porter saw it happen .
then why worry?
look , do you know that porter?
yes .
what's he saying?
he says it happened right down there .
happened , yes .
happened right down there .
you saw it?
well , not saw , heard .
heard .
i heard the brakes .
and i got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side ... uh , josef , the josef
emperor josef statue .
why didn't they bring him in the house?
could he have been conscious?
conscious?
uh , was he was he still alive?
ah , alive !
he couldn't have been alive , not with his head in the way it was .
i was told that he did not die at once .
no , i mean that [ german ]
no , you
he was quite dead .
he was he was quite dead .
he was quite dead .
but this sounds crazy .
lf he was killed at once , how could he have talked about me and this lady here?
why didn't you say all this at the inquest?
uh , it's better not to be mixed up in things like this .
things like what?
i was not the only one who did not give evidence .
who else?
three men helped to carry your friend to the statue .
kurtz?
yes .
the romanian?
yes .
and?
there was a third man .
he didn't give evidence .
you mean the doctor?
no , no , no .
he came later , after they carried him to the josef statue .
what did this man look like?
i didn't see his face .
he didn't look up .
he was quite , uh , ordinary .
he he might have been ... just anybody .
just anybody .
hello?
hello .
hello .
hello?
who was that?
i don't know .
they didn't answer .
but i was told there were only two men there .
you've got to tell your story to the police .
the police?
why police?
it's nonsense !
it is all nonsense !
it was an accident
you don't know it was an accident .
you only saw a dead man with three men carrying him .
i should have listened to my wife .
she said you were up to no good .
gossip .
suppose i take your evidence to the police?
now , hold on .
i have no evidence .
l i saw nothing , i said nothing .
it's not my business .
we'll make it your business .
hold on .
i have always liked you , but you must not bring this gentleman again .
you must go at once , please .
please !
please !
you shouldn't get mixed up in this .
well , if i do find out something , can i look you up again?
why don't you leave this town?
go home .
what is it?
what's she talking about?
the police are searching my room .
what the devil?
getting around , martins?
oh , pinning things on girls now .
miss schmidt , i should like to see your papers , please .
don't you give him anything .
thank you .
you were born in graz of austrian parents?
yes .
paine .
hmm .
it's very good , sir , isn't it , eh?
how much did you pay for this?
i'm afraid i shall have to keep this for a while , miss schmidt .
how do you expect her to live without her papers?
write her out a receipt .
give her a receipt for those letters too .
this way , miss .
i suppose it wouldn't interest you to know that harry lime was murdered .
you're too busy .
you haven't even bothered to get the complete evidence .
must you take those?
they'll be returned , miss .
they are private letters .
that's all right , miss .
don't worry .
we're used to it .
like doctors .
there was a third man there .
i suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you .
i'm not interested in whether a racketeer like lime was killed by his friends or by accident .
the only important thing is that he's dead .
i'm sorry .
tactful too , aren't we , callaghan?
calloway .
must you take those letters?
yes , i'm afraid so .
they're harry's .
that's the reason .
you won't learn anything from them .
they're only ... love letters .
there are not many of them .
they'll be returned to you , miss schmidt , as soon as they've been examined .
there's nothing in them .
harry never did anything .
only a small thing once , out of kindness .
and what was that?
you've got it in your hand .
major calloway?
finished?
yes .
okay .
you will have to come with us , miss schmidt .
you're not locking her up .
go home , martins , like a sensible chap .
get the next plane .
as soon as i get to the bottom of this .
death's at the bottom of everything , martins .
mind if i use that line in my next western?
you can't chuck me out .
here we are , miss .
your receipt for the letters .
i don't want it .
well , i've got it when you want it , miss .
anything really wrong with your papers?
they're forged .
oh .
why?
the russians would claim me .
i come from czechoslovakia .
what'd she say?
only complaining about the way they behaved in her house .
give her some cigarettes .
uh , cigarettes , hmm?
danke .
no , go ahead , take the
miss schmidt , ready?
now , look ,
i'll straighten out all this nonsense about harry .
you'll be all right .
sometimes he said i laughed too much .
oh , what's the name of that doctor?
harry's doctor?
dr. winkel .
what do you want to see a doctor for?
a bruised lip .
good .
laboratory , we're coming right down .
you wait here , miss schmidt .
ls dr. winkel in?
dr. winkel .
i'm sorry .
i don't speak german .
nein .
please , won't you say that i'm a friend of harry lime?
bitte .
thank you .
bittesehr .??
guten nacht .
dr. winkel?
vinkel .
uh , dr. vinkel .
quite a collection of , uh ... collection .
yes .
ls that your dog?
yes .
would you mind , mr. , uh
martins .
martins , coming to the point , please?
thank you .
i have guests waiting .
we were both friends of harry lime .
i was his medical advisor .
i want to find out all i can .
find out?
yeah , the details .
i can tell you very little .
he was run over by a car .
he was dead when i arrived .
who was with him?
two friends of his .
you sure?
two?
quite sure .
could he have been at all conscious?
i understand he was , yes , for a short time ... while they carried him across the road .
ln great pain?
mmm , not necessarily .
could he have been capable of making plans ... for me and others just , just during those few moments?
i understand he left some instructions before he died .
i cannot give an opinion .
i was not there .
my opinion is limited to the causes of death .
have you any reason to be dissatisfied?
was it possible that his death ... might have been not accidental?
could he have been
could he have been ... pushed , dr. winkel?
vinkel .
i cannot give an opinion .
the injuries to the head and skull would have been the same .
major , may i see you for a moment , please?
certainly , brodsky .
what is it?
this forgery is very clever , and we are interested in this case .
have you arrested the girl?
no , not yet .
please , keep this passport to yourself until i will make some inquiries .
will you , major?
thank you .
yes , of course .
right , sit down , miss schmidt .
we'll send your letters and things back to you .
and my passport?
we'll need that for a while .
what did he mean?
you know as much as i do .
miss schmidt , you were intimate with lime , weren't you?
we loved each other .
do you mean that?
do you know this man?
i've never seen him .
joseph harbin .
no .
he works in a military hospital .
no .
it's stupid to lie to me , miss schmidt .
i'm in a position to help you .
i'm not lying .
you're wrong about harry .
you're wrong about everything .
ln one of his letters , he asked you to telephone a good friend of his called joseph .
he gave you the number of the casanova club .
that's where a lot of friends of lime used to go .
it wasn't important .
what was the message?
something about meeting harry at his home .
harbin disappeared the day you telephoned .
we've got to find him .
you can help us .
what can i tell you , but you've got everything upside down .
okay .
that american friend of yours is still waiting for you .
he won't do you much good .
i thank you , miss schmidt .
we'll send for you when we want you .
hello , mr. martins .
i've been trying to get you at your hotel .
i've arranged that lecture for tomorrow .
well , what about?
on the modern novel .
you remember what we arranged .
oh .
they want you to talk on the crisis of faith .
what's that?
oh , i thought you'd know .
you're a writer .
but of course you do .
good night , old man .
i've forgotten my hat .
i'll let you know the time later .
mmm .??
drink?
whiskey .
two whiskeys .
zwei whisky .
how much?
twenty shillings .
oh , they don't take army money here .
how much did he say?
harry?
yes .
he moved his head , but the rest is good , isn't it?
good evening , miss schmidt .
good evening .
you've found out my little secret .
a man must live .
how goes the investigation?
have you proved the policemen are wrong?
not yet .
but you will .
our friend dr. winkel said you had called .
wasn't he helpful?
well , he was limited .
but mr. popescu is here tonight .
the romanian?
yes , the man who helped carry him .
i thought he'd left vienna .
he's back now .
well , i'd like to meet all of harry's friends .
i'll bring him to you .
haven't you done enough for tonight?
the porter said three men carried the body , and two of them are here .
who are you lookin 'for now?
shh .
shh .
don't .
please don't .
silly lookin 'bunch .
mr. popescu , mr. martins .
how do you do?
any friend of harry is a friend of mine .
i'll leave you together .
good evening , miss schmidt .
you remember me?
of course .
i helped harry fix her papers , mr. martins .
oh , you did?
not a sort of thing i should confess to a stranger , but you have to break the rules sometimes .
humanity is a duty .
cigarette , miss schmidt?
keep the pack .
i understand you were with harry
two double whiskeys .
it was a terrible thing .
i was just crossing the road to go to harry .
he and the baron were on the sidewalk .
maybe if i hadn't started to cross the road , it wouldn't have happened .
i can't help blaming myself and wishing things had been different .
anyway , he saw me and stepped off the sidewalk to meet me .
and the truck
it was terrible , mr. martins .
terrible .
i've never seen a man killed before .
i think there was something funny about the whole thing .
funny?
something wrong .
of course there was .
some ice for mr. martins .
you think so too?
it was so terribly stupid ... for a man like harry to be killed in an ordinary street accident .
that's all you meant?
what else?
who was the third man?
i oughtn't to drink it .
it makes me acid .
what man would you be referring to , mr. martins?
i was told that a third man helped you and kurtz carry the body .
i don't know how you got that idea .
you'll find all about it in the police report .
there was just the two of us , me and the baron .
who could have told you a story like that?
the porter at harry's place .
he was cleaning the window at the time .
and saw the accident?
no , he didn't see the accident , but he saw three men carrying the body .
why wasn't he at the police inquiry?
he doesn't want to get involved .
you'll never teach these austrians to be good citizens .
it was his duty to give the evidence .
even so , he remembers wrong .
what else did he tell you?
that harry was dead before you got him to that statue .
he probably knows a lot more than that .
somebody's lying .
hmm , not necessarily .
the police say he was mixed up in some racket?
oh , that's quite impossible .
he had a great sense of duty .
your friend kurtz seems to think it was possible .
i understand how an anglo saxon feels .
the baron hasn't traveled , you know?
he seems to have been around a bit .
do you know a man called , uh , harbin?
no .
joseph harbin .
joseph harbin?
no .
that's a nice girl , that , but she ought to go careful in vienna .
everybody ought to go careful in a city like this .
he will meet us at the bridge .
good .
hello ! ls it so very important for you?
yes , it is .
i am not a bad man .
i'd like to tell you something .
tell me , how did the car
shh , shh .
come tonight .
my wife goes out .
all right , i'll come back , but  shh .
tonight .
does that mean come in?
oh , yes , come in .
the porter's going to talk to us tonight .
need we go through it all again?
i can manage by myself .
you busy?
just another part i've got to learn .
can i hear you?
ln german?
i can try .
ls it comedy or tragedy?
comedy .
i don't play tragedy .
do i , uh , read  well , you read this .
oh .
well , l [ speaking broken german ]
what's that?
uh , heurigen , i guess .
h e z t
oh , let me see .
no , no , that's not the cue .
it means she has to sit down .
well , uh , frau hausman
no , no .
it's no good .
bad day?
it's always bad around this time .
he used to look in around 6 : 00 .
i've been frightened .
i've been alone without friends and money .
but i've never known anything like this .
please talk .
tell me about him .
tell you what?
oh , anything .
just talk .
where did you see him last , and what did you do?
oh , we didn't make much sense .
we drank too much .
once he tried to steal my girl .
where is she?
oh , that was nine years ago .
tell me more .
well , it's very difficult .
you knew harry .
we didn't do anything very amusing .
he just made everything seem like such fun .
was he clever when he was a boy?
he could fix anything .
what sort of things?
oh , little things .
how to put your temperature up before exam .
the best crib .
how to avoid this and that .
he fixed my papers for me .
he heard the russians were repatriating people like me who came from czechoslovakia .
he knew the right person straightaway for forging stamps .
yeah .
when he was 14 , he taught me the three card trick .
that's growing up fast .
he never grew up .
the world grew up around him , that's all .
and buried him .
anna , you'll fall in love again .
don't you see i don't want to?
i don't ever want to .
come on out and have a drink .
why did you say that?
seemed like a good idea .
it was just what he used to say .
well , uh , i didn't learn that from him .
lf we have to see the porter , we'd better go .
what's the hurry?
can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
i thought you wanted  a moment ago , you said you didn't want to see the porter .
we're both in it , harry .
holly .
i'm so sorry .
it's all right .
you might get my name right .
you know , you ought to find yourself a girl .
his english is so very bad , we'll let him talk german .
lf you'll be good enough to trans  look .
that's harry's place , isn't it?
yes .
let's go away .
what's the matter?
let's not get into any more trouble .
wait here .
what's the matter?
uh , what is , los?
l i don't understand .
um , porter , uh , dead .
kaputt .
the porter is odraht .
kaputt .
porter?
he's murdered .
papa !
ja , papa !
i , uh , don't understand .
what is it?
the porter's been murdered .
they think you did it .
hello?
papa !
sneak out the other way and go back to your theater .
i'd better not see you again .
what are you going to do?
i wish i knew .
be sensible .
tell major calloway .
get me major callaghan on the phone .
oh , mr. martins .
it's very urgent .
just get him on the telephone .
do you know his number?
no , i don't know his number .
i'll look it up for you .
ls there a car here?
of course .
there's one waiting for you .
never mind about the number .
take me to the headquarters
hold on !
i haven't even told you where to take me yet !
driver !
driver !
slow down !
have you got orders to kill me?
ah , ah , ah !
ah , mr. martins !
what a relief to see you .
i was beginning to think something had happened to you .
everything's ready for you .
i was frantic in case you hadn't got ... my message at the hotel .
porters out here are so unreliable .
we're all set for a wonderful meeting .
you'll find the audience most appreciative .
oh , let me take your coat .
i've got it .
there'll be refreshments afterwards .
come along .
follow me .
well , here we are , ladies and gentlemen .
would you look after those?
thank you .
would you like to sit there?
that's right .
i have much pleasure in introducing mr. holly martins from the other side .
well [ clears throat ]
bring the car and anyone else who would like to come .
don't be long .
hmm .
yeah , well , l i suppose that is what i meant to say .
of course , of course .
do you believe , mr. martins , in the stream of consciousness?
stream of consciousness?
well , uh well , uh
well , uh  what author has chiefly influenced you?
grey .
grey?
what grey?
zane grey .
that's mr. martins 'little joke , of course .
we know perfectly well zane grey wrote what we call westerns .
cowboys and bandits .
mr. james joyce now , where would you put him?
oh , uh , would you mind repeating that question?
i said , where would you put mr. james joyce?
ln what category?
can i ask , is mr. martins engaged on a new book?
yes .
it's called the third man .
a novel , mr. martins?
it's a murder story .
i've just started it .
it's based on fact .
why , it's mr. popescu !
oh , very great pleasure to see you here .
as you know , mr. popescu is a very great supporter of one of our medical charities .
are you a slow writer , mr. martins?
not when i get interested .
i'd say you were doing something pretty dangerous this time .
yeah?
mixing fact and fiction .
should i make it all fact?
why , no , mr. martins .
i'd say stick to fiction .
straight fiction .
i'm too far along with the book , mr. popescu .
haven't you ever scrapped a book , mr. martins?
never .
pity .
ladies and gentlemen , if there are no more questions ,
i think i can call the meeting officially closed .
that's him .
who's there?
who is it?
who is it?
it's all right .
it's all right .
i told you to go away , martins .
this isn't santa fe , i'm not a sheriff and you aren't a cowboy .
you've been blundering around with the worst bunch of racketeers in vienna ,
harry's friends , and now you're wanted for murder .
put down drunk and disorderly too .
i have .
what's the matter with your hand?
parrot bit me .
oh , stop behaving like a fool , martins .
i'm only a little fool .
i'm an amateur at it .
you're a professional .
you've been shaking your cap and bells all over town .
get me the harry lime file , and get mr. martins a whiskey .
i don't need your drinks , calloway .
you will .
i don't want another murder in this case , so you're going to hear the facts .
you haven't told me a single one yet .
have you ever heard of penicillin?
well?
ln vienna , there hasn't been enough penicillin to go around .
stealing penicillin from the military hospitals , diluting it to make it go further , and selling it to patients .
do you see what that means?
are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder?
these were murders .
men with gangrened legs , women in childbirth , and there were children too .
they used some of this diluted penicillin against meningitis .
the lucky children died .
the unlucky ones went off their heads .
you can see them now in the mental ward .
that was the racket harry lime organized .
calloway , you haven't shown me one shred of evidence .
we're just coming to that .
paine , magic lantern show .
very good , sir .
paine's one of your devoted readers .
he's promised to lend me one of your books .
which one is it , paine?
the lone rider of santa fe , sir .
that's right .
i'd like to visit texas one day , sir .
come on , show me what you've got to show .
all right , paine?
yes , sir .
paine , paine , paine .
i got them muddled .
it's the new lot that's just come in for mr. crabbin .
see this man here?
a fellow called harbin , a medical orderly at the general hospital .
he worked for lime and helped to steal the stuff from the laboratories .
we forced him to give information to us which led us as far as kurtz and lime .
but we didn't arrest them , as it might have spoiled our chances of getting the others .
next , paine .
i'd like a word with this orderly , harbin .
so would l .
well , bring him in .
i can't .
he disappeared a week ago .
this is more like a mortuary than police headquarters .
we have better witnesses .
look here .
how could he have done it?
seventy pounds a tube .
go back to the hotel , and do keep out of trouble .
i'll try and fix things with the austrian police .
you'll be all right in the hotel , but i can't be responsible for you on the streets .
i'm not asking you to .
i'm sorry , martins .
i'm sorry too .
you still got that airplane ticket on you?
we'll send one across to your hotel in the morning .
thank you .
excuse me .
get me austrian police headquarters .
can i have that woman's passport?
you know , the anna schmidt one .
oh ... we're not going to pick her up for that , are we?
what can we do?
we have our instructions .
??
it's me .
it's me .
hello .
what is it?
what's happened to you?
just came to see you .
come in .
i thought you were going to keep away .
are the police after you?
i don't know .
you're drunk , aren't you?
a bit .
i'm sorry .
but i did want to say good bye before i pushed off .
i'm going back home .
why?
it's what you've always wanted all of you .
kitty?
here , kitty .
kitty?
here , kitty .
kitty , kitty , kitty , kitty .
don't you want to play , kitty?
come on .
sleepy?
sleepy kitty?
not very sociable , is he?
no , he only liked harry .
what made you decide so suddenly?
i , l brought you these .
they , they got a little wet .
what happened to your hand?
a parrot
let it go .
have you seen calloway?
lmagine a parrot nipping a man?
have you?
it's oh , i , l
i've been saying good bye all over , you know .
he told you , didn't he?
told me?
about harry .
do you know?
i've seen major calloway today .
he is better dead .
i knew he was mixed up , but not like that .
i knew him for 20 years at least , i thought i knew him .
suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time?
he liked to laugh .
seventy pounds a tube .
he wanted me to write for his great medical charity .
i'll put these flowers in the water .
perhaps i could have raised the price to 80 pounds for him .
oh , please .
for heaven's sake , stop making him in your image .
harry was real .
he wasn't just your friend and my lover .
he was harry .
well , don't preach wisdom to me .
you talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners .
no .
i don't know .
i'm just a hack writer who drinks too much ... and falls in love with girls .
you .
me?
don't be such a fool .
of course .
lf you'd rung me up and asked me were you fair or dark ... or had a moustache , i wouldn't have known .
oh , i am leaving vienna .
i don't care whether henry was murdered by kurtz or popescu ... or the third man or
whoever killed him , there was some sort of ... justice .
maybe i would've killed him myself .
a person doesn't change because you find out more .
look .
i've got a splitting headache , and you stand there and just talk and talk and talk .
l i hate it .
that's the first time i ever saw you laugh .
do it again .
there isn't enough for two laughs .
i'd make comic faces ... and stand on my head and grin at you between my legs ... and tell all sorts of jokes .
i wouldn't stand a chance , would i?
well ... you did tell me i ought to find myself a girl .
what kind of a spy do you think you are , satchel foot?
what are you tailing me for?
cat got your tongue?
come on out .
come out , come out , whoever you are .
step out in the light and let's have a look at ya .
who's your boss?
harry .
harry !
i followed his shadow ... until , suddenly
well?
this is where he vanished .
i see .
i suppose you don't believe me .
no .
look .
i tell you
you don't think i'm blind , do you?
yes .
where were you when you saw him first?
fifty yards right down there .
which side of the road?
i was on that side .
his shadow was on that side .
and there are no turnings on either side .
what about the doorways?
i tell you , i heard him running ahead of me !
yes , yes , yes .
and then he vanished out there , i suppose , with a puff of smoke and like a clap of
it wasn't the german gin .
well , what's this?
where are we?
it's the main sewer .
runs right into the blue danube .
smells sweet , doesn't it?
we should have dug deeper than a grave .
you knew him , major?
hmm .
yes .
yes .
joseph harbin .
medical orderly at the general hospital .
he used to work for harry lime .
joseph harbin?
yes .
he's the man i told you was missing .
next time we'll have a foolproof coffin .
fraulein schmidt?
ja .
where are you taking me?
lnternational police headquarters , just to check up .
i'm sorry , miss .
it's orders .
we can't go against the protocol .
i don't even know what protocol means .
neither do i , miss .
mademoiselle , your lipstick .
thank you .
anna , what's happened to you?
all right .
keep out of this .
listen , i've got to talk to you .
i've just seen a dead man walking .
all right , chum .
get back .
i saw him buried .
but now i've seen him alive .
just a minute .
bring her in here .
you stay out here .
come in , miss schmidt .
now then , miss schmidt .
i'm not interested in your forged papers .
that's purely a russian case .
when did you last see lime?
two weeks ago .
i want the truth , miss schmidt .
we know he's alive .
it is true , then .
joseph harbin's body was found in the coffin .
what did you say?
i'm sorry .
i said another man was buried in his place .
where's harry?
that's what we want to find out .
i'm sorry .
i don't seem able to understand anything you say . l
he is alive .
now this minute , he is doing something .
miss schmidt , we know he's somewhere across the canal in the russian sector .
you may as well help us .
ln a few minutes ,
colonel brodsky will be questioning you about your papers .
tell me where lime is .
i don't know .
lf you help me , i am prepared to help you .
martins always said you were a fool .
vienna is a closed city , miss schmidt .
he can't get away .
right .
poor harry .
i wish he was dead .
he would be safe from all of you , then .
why , that's you !
come up .
winkel , look who is here .
i want to speak to you , kurtz .
of course .
come up .
i'll wait here .
i don't understand .
i want to talk to harry .
are you mad?
all right .
i'm mad .
i've seen a ghost .
you tell harry i want to see him .
be reasonable .
come up and talk .
no , thank you .
i like the open .
tell him i'll wait by that wheel there .
or do ghosts only rise by night , dr. winkel?
you got an opinion on that?
hello , old man .
how are you?
hello , harry .
well , well , they seem to be giving you quite some busy time .
well , listen .
i want to talk to you .
hmm , yes?
talk to me?
well , of course .
come on .
kids used to ride this thing a lot in the old days .
but they haven't the money now , poor devils .
listen , harry .
i didn't believe that
it's good to see you , holly .
i was at your funeral .
that was pretty smart , wasn't it?
oh , the same old indigestion , holly .
these are the only things that help , these tablets .
these are the last .
can't get 'em anywhere in europe anymore .
do you know what's happened to your girl?
hmm?
she's been arrested .
tough , very tough , but don't worry , old man .
they won't hurt her .
they're handing her over to the russians .
what can i do , old man?
i'm dead , aren't i?
you can help some .
holly , exactly who did you tell about me , hmm?
i told the police .
unwise , holly .
and anna .
unwise .
did the , uh , police believe you?
you don't care anything at all about anna , do you?
i've got quite a lot on my mind .
you wouldn't do anything .
what do you want me to do?
be reasonable .
you can get somebody else  do you expect me to give myself up?
why not?
it's a far better thing that i do ... with the old limelight than follow the curtain
no .
you and i aren't heroes .
the world doesn't make any heroes
you've got plenty of contacts .
outside of your stories .
i've got to be so careful .
i'm only safe in the russian zone .
i'm only safe as long as they can use me .
as long as they can use you?
i wish i could get rid of this thing .
so that's how they found out about anna .
you told them , didn't you?
don't try to be a policeman , old man .
what do you expect me to be?
part of your  part?
you can have any part as long as you don't interfere .
i've never cut you out of anything .
yes , i remember when they raided the gambling joint , you knew a safe way out .
sure !
yeah , safe for you .
not safe for me .
old man , you never should have gone to the police , you know .
you ought to leave this thing alone .
have you ever seen any of your victims?
you know , i never feel comfortable on these sort of things .
victims?
don't be melodramatic .
tell me .
would you really feel any pity if one of those dots stopped moving forever?
lf i offered you 20, 000 for every dot that stopped , would you really , old man , tell me to keep my money?
or would you calculate how many dots you could afford to spend?
free of income tax , old man .
free of income tax the only way you can save money nowadays .
a lot of good your money will do you in jail .
that jail's in another zone .
there's no proof against me , besides you .
i should be pretty easy to get rid of .
pretty easy .
i wouldn't be too sure .
i carry a gun .
i don't think they'd look for a bullet wound after you hit that ground .
they dug up your coffin .
and found harbin?
mm hmm .
pity .
holly , what fools we are talking to each other this way , as though i'd do anything to you or you to me .
you're just a little mixed up about things in general .
nobody thinks in terms of human beings .
governments don't .
why should we?
they talk about the people and the proletariat .
i talk about the suckers and the mugs .
it's the same thing .
they have their five year plans , and so have l .
you used to believe in god .
i still do believe in god , old man .
i believe in god and mercy and all that .
but the dead are happier dead .
they don't miss much here , poor devils .
what do you believe in?
oh , if we ever get anna out of this mess , be kind to her .
i think you'll find she's worth it .
i wish i'd asked you to bring me some of these tablets from home .
holly , i'd like to cut you in , old man .
there's nobody left in vienna i can really trust , and we've always done everything together .
when you make up your mind , send me a message .
i'll meet you anyplace , anytime .
and when we do meet , old man , it's you i want to see , not the police .
remember that , won't you?
and don't be so gloomy !
after all , it's not that awful .
ln ltaly , for 30 years under the borgias , they had warfare , terror , murder , bloodshed .
but they produced michelangelo , leonardo da vinci and the renaissance .
ln switzerland , they had brotherly love .
they had 500 years of democracy and peace , and what did that produce?
the cuckoo clock .
so long , holly .
but look here , martins .
you can always arrange to meet him at , at some little cafe here in the international zone .
it would never work .
we'll never get him in the russian zone .
calloway , you expect too much .
oh , i know he deserves to hang .
you've proved your stuff , but 20 years is a long time .
don't ask me to tie the rope .
okay .
forget it .
busy , major?
what is it , brodsky?
we have identified the girl .
here is her report .
i've questioned her .
we've got nothing against her .
we shall apply for her at the four power meeting tomorrow .
she has no right to be here .
i've asked your people to help with lime .
that's a different case .
it is being looked into .
so long , major .
ln the last war , a general would hang his opponent's picture on the wall .
he got to know him that way .
i'm beginning to know lime .
i think this would've worked , with your help .
what price would you pay?
name it .
here we are .
you'll be all right here , miss .
i don't understand major calloway . l
i expect he's got a soft spot for you , miss .
why has he done all this?
don't you worry , miss .
you're well out of things .
there we are , miss .
thank you .
you've been so kind .
well , i'll be saying good night .
good night , miss .
good bye .
are you going too?
oh .
what are you doing here?
i wanted to see you off .
see me off?
from here?
oh , i watched you onto the train , uh no harm in that , is there?
how did you know i'd be here?
i heard something about it at police headquarters .
have you been seeing major calloway again?
of course not .
i don't live in his pocket .
harry , what is it?
for heaven sakes , stop calling me harry .
i'm sorry .
let's go .
what's on your mind?
why did you hide here?
hide?
can't a fellow have a drink?
here .
it'll be cold on that train .
i shall be all right .
you send me a wire as soon as you are .
what's going to happen?
where is harry?
he's safe in the russian zone .
how do you know?
well , i saw him today .
how is he?
he can look after himself .
don't worry .
did he say anything about me?
tell me !
oh , the usual things .
ls something wrong?
did you tell calloway about harry?
of course i didn't .
why should he help me?
the russians will make trouble for him .
that's his headache .
oh , anna !
his?
why are you lying?
we're getting you out of here , aren't we?
i'm not going .
you'd
anna , don't you recognize a good turn when you see one?
you have seen calloway?
what are you two doing?
well , they , they asked me to help take him .
i'm helping .
poor harry .
poor harry .
poor harry ... wouldn't even lift a finger to help you .
oh , you've got your precious honesty and don't want anything else .
you still want him .
i don't want him anymore .
i don't want to see him , hear him , but he's still a part of me .
that's a fact .
i couldn't do a thing to harm him .
oh , anna , why do we always have to quarrel?
lf you want to sell your services , i'm not willing to be the price .
i loved him .
you loved him .
what good have we done him ... for love?
look at yourself .
they have a name for faces like that .
calloway .
come in here .
there isn't much time .
i want to get a plane out of here tonight .
so she talked you out of it .
gave me these .
a girl of spirit .
she's right .
it is none of my business .
it won't make any difference in the long run .
i'll get him .
well , i won't have helped .
that'll be a fine boast to make .
well , i always wanted you to catch that plane , didn't i?
you all did .
i'd better see if there's anyone still at the terminus .
you may need a priority .
mind if i drop off somewhere on the way?
i've got an appointment .
it won't take five minutes .
of course .
why don't you come in too?
you're a writer .
it might interest you .
this is the biggest children's hospital in vienna .
all the kids in here are the result of lime's penicillin racket .
he'd had meningitis .
they gave it some of lime's penicillin .
terrible pity , isn't it?
paine lent me one of your books .
oklahoma kid , i think it was .
i read a bit of it .
looks as if it's gonna be pretty good .
what made you take up this sort of thing?
been doing it for long?
all right , calloway .
you win .
i never knew there were snake charmers in texas .
i said you win .
win what?
i'll be your ... dumb decoy duck .
psst !
paine .
look , sir !
how much longer are you going to sit here?
shall i go over there , sir?
no .
no , leave them for a while .
mein herr , ballon?
nein , danke .
nein .
ballon?
go on .
hop it , scarper .
ballon , mein herr?
all right , all right .
only one .
go on , scarper .
you should have gone .
how did you know i was here , anyway?
from kurtz .
they have just been arrested .
but harry won't come .
he's not a fool .
yes , paine .
slip over there .
see what she's up to .
right , sir .
don't tell me you are doing all this for nothing .
what's your price this time?
no price , anna .
honest , sensible , sober , harmless holly martins .
holly .
what a silly name .
you must feel very proud to be a police informer .
harry , get away !
the police are outside !
quick !
anna .
sir , the back !
all right .
martins , get back !
harry !
ls that you?
you're through .
come out .
you haven't got a chance this way .
what do you want?
you might as well give up .
mr. martins , sir , get back , get back !
keep back , sir !
come back !
come back , sir !
martins !
martins !
be careful , martins .
don't take any chances .
lf you see him , shoot !
what time is it?
2 : 30 .
i'll have to step on it if you're going to catch that plane .
calloway , can't you do something about anna?
i'll do what i can , if she'll let me .
wait a minute .
let me out .
well , there's not much time .
one can't just leave .
please .
be sensible , martins .
i haven't got a sensible name , calloway .
