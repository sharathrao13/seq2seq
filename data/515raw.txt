hello?
yeah .
shit , yeah .
no .
no , no , i'm up .
i'm up .
i'll be right there .
all right .
bye .
mornin ', buddy .
come here , shithead .
come here .
good morning .
ohh !
it's cold , people .
detroit's gonna have a white new year's this year , because we're getting hit with yet another storm .
no shit !
sports comin'up .
in the lane , snow is glistening
a beautiful sight we're happy tonight
this kind of sex is evolutionary instinct , gentlemen .
tiger stadium .
bleachers empty , except me and a friend .
we always get it on whenever and wherever we can .
no one saw us except for the left fielder .
let's just say he enjoyed the show , and i didn't mind the audience .
impulsive sex is in our genes , boys .
don't deny yourselves .
i gotta go jump in the snow to cool my shit off .
have a good new year , i.
you too , babe .
that animal was your type , iris .
probably an ex con .
you two should hook up .
fuck off , carlyle .
we were just talking about acting on impulses with no guilt .
don't get angry , i.
you only bed criminals .
everyone knows that .
which is unfortunate for me , because i am in love with you .
i don't bed criminals .
i fuck bad boys .
big difference .
i just hope i don't have to become a fuckin 'ax murderer to prove i'm worthy .
what the hell is this?
fun and games?
buzzkill .
does anybody work around here anymore?
hey , sarge .
you're late .
happy new year .
hey , you're pissing me off .
get outta here before i give you something to do .
you boys don't wanna get stuck with us here tonight .
bye , boys .
i'll see you guys at the new precinct .
happy new year , iris .
later , iris .
stuck .
that's not very nice , boss .
you're right .
i apologize .
you're lovely and amazing , and it's my honor to spend new year's eve with you .
you're a sarcastic prick , aren't you?
we are going to have a good time tonight , boss .
we officially shut down at midnight , but all calls are being diverted , so we might as well be closed now .
we could start gettin 'fucked up real early !
all right , but not too early , all right?
we still gotta pack this shit up .
not much .
all the computers are gone .
most of the gear .
now , come on , sarge .
it's my favorite holiday .
i even put on my very special , sexy holiday boots .
even though we're here , i wanna do it right .
how could you possibly do it wrong?
we will conspire
as we dream by the fire
to face unafraid
the plans that we made
walkin'in a winter wonderland
never take for granted the greatest power of all ... the power to choose .
consider the choices you have made in the past .
and when they led you astray , faith in times of opposition ... will lead to your salvation , or often the easy way will lead only to temptation .
think of consequences ... and cherish your power to choose the righteous path .
you figure i'd be more liable to tell the truth with god watchin '.
if you believe in god , mr. portnow .
you don't?
i never met a brother who didn't have faith .
i've stood in front of dozens of men ... who were all staring death in the face .
every single one of them begged for god's help .
after seeing all those pleas go unanswered ,
i ... lost my faith .
so what's the what?
my answer ... is this .
no .
i guess we're done here .
what'd you think?
i was gonna let you walk outta here with the crowd for protection?
get the fuck up .
walk in front of me .
" [ pipe organ ]
amazing grace
how sweet the sound
that saved a wretch
like me
police . !
hold it right there !
freeze , bishop !
drop your weapon !
drop it now , motherfucker !
we're here at the new precinct 21 , where one of the city's most powerful crime figures , marion bishop , is being held in the alleged murder of an undercover police officer .
move back !
bishop , notorious for his brutal execution methods , earns untold millions from his various criminal operations ... in the detroit area .
bishop's crew .
yeah?
now is not the time .
i'm lieutenant holloway .
marcus duvall , organized crime and racketeering squad .
this is my team .
i know who you are .
sorry about your man .
where is this son of a bitch?
i don't spend one night , not one night , inside , and we both know why .
you do whatever you have to do to get me out of here .
do you understand?
that guy's a cop killer .
judge hands down bail ,
i swear to christ i'll ...
no arraignment 'cause of the holiday .
bishop spends two days inside until he has a chance to make bail .
don't worry , cap .
we got him .
we ain't gonna fuckin 'let him go .
happy new year !
come on , man .
there's only three of us here .
yeah , well , one of us is irish .
my god , look at this thing .
it's gotta be older than me .
you'll never take me alive , g man !
look at this room .
boy , there's gotta be evidence in here from some of my first busts back in the day .
uh , they got rid of all the civil war stuff .
oh , ho !
hey , that's so funny .
don't quit the day job , all right?
sarge?
yeah?
friday appointment's here .
are you kiddin 'me?
any feelings of anxiety lately?
yeah .
two words .
the lions .
they give me a lot of anxiety .
please stop avoiding my questions , sergeant .
are you still taking the painkillers?
come on , doc .
i mean , even you have got to be getting a little bored of these conversations .
why don't we talk about the real reason ... that you would come down here on new year's eve ... in the middle of this storm .
okay .
uh , let's see .
we had an appointment .
i think the real reason ... is you're in love with me .
huh .
interesting .
i can see it in your eyes .
that's why you come wearing these fancy clothes .
it's very flattering , but i think you should stop denying it , you know?
i hear ...
no , i hear you .
you're right .
you're right .
you're right .
my face obviously betrays me .
i didn't get dressed up like this because i'm going to a new year's eve party later tonight .
oh , no .
no , sergeant .
this was all for you .
a form of seduction .
is it working?
wonderfully .
i'm glad .
okay , well , we'll have to finish this conversation another time .
what is this thing here?
hey , hey , hey , hey !
that's mine .
all right , relax .
i don't care about the file .
so , uh , you got a desk job at precinct 21 , i see .
you don't quit , do you?
how do you feel about it?
how do i feel about it?
it's no big change .
so i guess the new year's not bringing anything different for you .
how's your leg , by the way?
i noticed you weren't limping anymore .
what's that supposed to mean?
it's just an observation .
five years of undercover work , and now this .
wow !
good bye .
you must be itching to get back on the streets .
good bye .
happy new year .
happy new year to you .
i'll see you at the new precinct .
god , you know , i cannot wait .
i'd walk you out , you know , but i just have so much ...
i know the way .
thank you .
so much to do .
jake , you should see this .
and now lieutenant marcus duvall ... that's officer ray portnow's superior ... is coming out of ...
hey , that's duvall .
good cop .
good man .
crime kingpin marion bishop in custody .
that man is in hell right now .
... responsible for the slaying , the fifth in motor city this year alone .
hey , you okay , jake?
everybody in the bus .
you know what a bus looks like .
new year's eve in a house of a thousand doors .

they've already been advised .
copy .
thirteen .
what a piece of shit .
i don't care .
i'll be glad to get out of this .
well , how about this for a new year's present?
that scumbag bishop is hand delivered to us !
i'm gonna get some righteous payback from that skel for ray portnow .
what are you doin 'here?
what?
i've heard so much about this bishop guy over the years .
i wanna see him .
i thought you gave up bad boys .
get back inside .
it's not the new year yet , sarge .
you must be roenick .
no offense , officer , but i'm pretty fuckin 'perturbed about this .
we're closing down .
we're short staffed .
central said we park here overnight until the road's clear .
you got a problem with that , call in .
i tried .
i'll give it another shot .
jake , come on .
you're not gonna send these guys back out in that weather .
nah .
now , look .
we'll lock 'em up , and we'll let 'em be .
no problem .
all right , fine .
but they're your responsibility .
i don't wanna hear jack shit about them or from them .
let's go inside .
bring 'em in . !
come on .
bring 'em in . !
interesting cast .
yeah , we got a female gangbanger ... who swears she never committed a crime in her life .
this guy here specializes in counterfeit merchandise .
need a fake rolex , he's your man .
some junkie who robbed a deli .
allegedly .
allegedly .
he's still ridin 'on a high right now .
and the star of the show .
he needs no intro .
you know his credits .
sarge , when it rains , it snows .
got another freakin 'guest .
how's your car?
won't move .
must've walked two miles in this damn weather .
i'm soaking .
look at me .
well , thank god you're not hurt .
so how did you enjoy your file?
oh , yeah , yeah .
you dropped this .
oh , really?
i dropped it?
that's strange , because i was sure that you took it .
definitely dropped it .
that's disappointing .
if you had stolen it , it would've been the first time ... you were taking a proactive interest in your therapy .
you know it's a bunch of bullshit .
so you read it .
yeah , i fuckin 'read it .
did you steal it?
you know i stole it , all right?
and stop being so goddamn happy about it , dr. sabian .
it makes me sick .
i think he's hiding behind his injury .
he's not really hurt .
jake roenick no longer considers himself a cop .
what kind ofbullshit is that?
huh?
you think i'm scared?
that's what it is , right?
if you'd read further on , you would see that's not what i think .
all right , well , then tell me what it is that you think , dr. mrs. mind fuck .
what is it that you think i'm hiding from?
i'm not gonna explain myself to you if you're gonna act like a child .
excuse me .
run away .
we both know you can't handle this shit , 'cause you want to fuck me .
sergeant , if i wanted to fuck you , it would've happened already .
gotta learn to control yourself , doc .
it's affecting your work .
it's very unprofessional .
don't try to discredit me because you're afraid i may be right .
right?
yes .
about what?
come on .
tell me what it is you think i'm hiding from , and then i'll tell you whether i think you're right .
okay !
i believe that the prospect of responsibility has rendered you impotent !
impotent?
yes !
and that's why you're working at this old precinct behind a desk .
i'm injured , all right?
that's why i'm here .
bullshit !
you feel responsible for the death of your team eight months ago , and that's why you're here .
i didn't do anything wrong .
a board of inquiry cleared me .
that's right .
you didn't do anything wrong .
but it was your decision that sent them down the left hallway ... and not the right , out the front door and not the back .
and you don't want to make decisions like that again .
yeah .
so?
maybe you're right .
what?
you want a medal?
so now you're hiding behind that desk .
and behind that liquor in your drawer ... and those ... pills in that stupid little matchbox .
but there's still one life you're responsible for , no matter where you go .
oh , let me guess .
my own?
yeah , your own .
and if you don't start taking care of yourself , you're never gonna be the cop you used to be .
bish .

you fuckin 'kidding me , sergeant?
i know .
i know .
shh .
how's he doin ', iris?
i'm sorry about your partner .
we just moved him to an office .
oh , shit .
he needs a doctor fast .
why wasn't there an alarm on your back door?
that alarm hasn't worked in months .
they're still out there .
some kind of a truck out there in the forest .
it's not moving .
are you kidding me?
they must have assumed we'd call for backup .
i'm having a little problem here .
the phones aren't working .
sure , they cut the wires .
the storm could've taken the phones out .
bullshit !
those are bishop's guys out there .
they cut the wires .
just try the radios !
forget it .
frequencies are blocked .
the frequencies are blocked?
that's not easy to do .
well , they must've got professional help , because all the frequencies are blocked .
they probably screwed up your cell phones too .
i'm not getting a signal .
neither am i.
what the hell is this !
i told you !
they're bishop's guys out there !
they're gonna break him outta here one way or another .
maybe somebody heard the gunshots and will come check it out .
there's nothing out there but factories .
no , no .
i don't buy any of that .
they , whoever they are , are gone .
they're gonna think they're fireworks .
they don't give a shit about me , and i'm going !
thank you .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
what the hell is happening here?
this is a fucking police precinct , for god's sake !
jesus christ !
sarge , if you're all right , you better take a look at this .
they're surrounding the place .
it's a goddamn siege .
i am not supposed to be here .
i am not supposed to be here .
i am not supposed to be here .
shit !
cease fire !
cease fire !
cease fire !
it wasn't gunshots .
bishop . !
i told you .
those are bishop's troops out there .
they're taking him outta here tonight , no matter what . !
this doesn't make any sense .
this is a police precinct !
shut the fuck up , doc .
you said that already .
all right , look .
everybody just listen up .
maybe they're trying to give us a way out of this .
let's just give them what they want .
let 'em have bishop , and it's all over .
nobody else gets hurt . !
not a bad fuckin 'idea .
no , we can't let that scumbag gangster , a cop killer , walk out of our precinct !
it's not an option !
i'm trying to defuse this situation .
you got a wounded cop over there !
i already said no !
what in god's name are we supposed to do then , sergeant?
they're gettin 'ready to storm the fort .
i don't think so , all right?
i think they're just tryin 'to scare us into giving up bishop .
they're doin 'a damn good job .
see , this blackout , this is the kind of shit that deflates human smugness ... about government's so called miraculous technologies .
doesn't it?
shove it up their lyin 'corporate fuckin 'asses .
this ain't no blackout , junkie .
something suspect is goin 'on .
i wanna know what the funk it is .
i know it hurts , but we gotta get you away from these windows .
jasper , you got those flashlights?
i don't know where the fuck the are . !
everything's been packed . !
roenick !
get down !
get down !
jasper , get the blinds !
all right .
all right .
yeah , we're perfectly safe now .
these are just scare tactics , all right?
they don't know how much firepower we have or don't have .
they're not gonna come in here again .
it's too risky .
what about us gettin 'out there , sergeant?
l i need help real bad .
i need it .
let's barricade up these doors and windows , and i'll figure out how to get some help in here .
what are you doing this for , jake?
nobody gives a shit anymore about anything .
we can end this right now .
i can't let a murderer walk out of here .
i can't do that .
i'll get us out of this , jasper .
i will .
i promise .
you got almost no chance out there , buddy .
that cop in there dies if i don't try .
you keep the place locked down until i get some help .
all right .
i'd better cover from the front windows .
i can see the truck better from there .
keep your head down .
schmuck .
oh , shit !
oh , shit . !
i found this on our friend out there .
fuck it .
fact or fiction?
you pulled a guy's spine out once , didn't you?
are you a surgeon?
i heard that bullet you took in your belly is still lodged in there , rattling around .
i bet you it's causing you a lot of intestinal issues .
right?
right , man?
bishop , i need to talk to you .
so i just killed a man .
his name was danny barbero .
a cop .
a cop who works for ray portnow .
the man you killed .
so tell me why cops are risking their lives to get to you , bishop .
why should i answer that question?
because i'm thinking about sending you out to the wolves and saving my own ass if you don't .
i assume you know who i am , sergeant .
you're a scumbag gangster .
and one of my scumbag partners in crime is your fellow officer , marcus duvall .
marcus duvall and his entire team .
we used to split things 50 50 .
marcus got greedy .
he wanted more .
so you killed ray portnow .
after he tried to kill me .
mm .
right .
they're here to execute me , because if i make it to court , every single one of them goes to jail for the rest of their days .
how many cops are involved in this?
i can't say exactly , but the blood money runs through your entire department .
i bet they're all here now , and they can't allow me to leave this precinct alive .
they can't allow any of us to leave here alive .
now that we all know it's them out there .
sarge .
poor guy , he never had a chance .
anyone know ifhe had any family?
someone's coming . !
shit , someone's coming . !
someone's coming .
hit squad , sergeant .
they're here for all of us .
me?
all of us .
you especially .
fuck you , dealer .
this is all your fault .
those are your brethren out there , old man , not mine .
don't compare me with your scumbag friends out there .
if it was up to me , i'd kick your ass out the door .
i'd like to see you come try .
yeah , sure .
you'd love to kill another cop today , wouldn't you?
only you .
they'll be coming on strong now .
why?
why are cops coming to kill us?
they need to kill him before he fingers them in court .
they need to kill us too , now that we know it's them .
so ... here's what we're gonna do .
we're gonna take positions all around the precinct , and we're gonna hold 'em off until dawn .
iris , alex , you know how to use a firearm?
no .
no .
why don't you give me one of them guns , sergeant .
i'll help you fend off the black hats .
oh .
oh , shit .
men are here .
good .
what a fuckin 'mess this is .
i know .
i'm lookin 'at this as a matter of simple mathematics .
if we walk and those eight people survive , then 33 lives are destroyed .
the lives of my men and their families .
people i'm responsible for .
people i ...
people i love .
i don't see any other way , marcus .
the blood trail leads right back to us .
we have no choice .
if we go through this , we are gonna have to live with this for the rest of our lives .
but you know something , mike?
i could live with that more than i could live with a cell mate .
once we step outside , those people are no longer civilians or cops .
we gotta put 'em all down .
without pause , without regard .

don't know that .
you're so calm .

all right , choose a weapon .
anything you see .

'cause if you don't , you'll die .
no resistance .
advancing to the front door .
we're going in .
spread out across the precinct .
stop anything that approaches .
we might make it through this night .
christ almighty .

they're not going anywhere .
put that goddamn weapon down .
j ...
old man , you do not wanna point that weapon at me .
that is not a bright thing to do .
put that goddamn weapon down slowly , then back away from it , all of ya . !
jake , get their weapons .
take their weapons .
ain't this a bitch .
we saved your asses .
now you wanna turn on us?
yeah , well , thank you for that , sweet cheeks .
now , put your weapon down .
the problem is outside , not inside .
put the gun down , jasper .
no , no .
you know what the problem is?
that we criminals got rights , baby .
that's right .
we got rights to be protected against assault under any circumstances .
if you can't provide that , well , fuck you ... we will .
you're a fuckin 'psycho .
jesus christ , jake !
what?
are you gonna trust these freaks?
huh?
the first chance they get to blow our brains out , they'll try to make a break for it .
they need us as much as we need them .
we all gotta start trusting each other right now if we're gonna make it through this night .
put the gun down , jasper .
put the goddamn gun down !
what?
shit .
all right .
all right .
now , let's all introduce ourselves to each other .
it's new year's eve .
let's turn over a new leaf .
all right .
let's not all fuckin 'speak at once .
the name's smiley .
i'm a libra , and ...
i'll handle these jokers .
you handle your people , maybe we get out of here tonight .
he armed his prisoners .
it's a smart play .
must be at least eight guns in there now .
just a couple hours till the sun's up .
if we can't breach , what do we do?
get the a. v. 5 here .
are you sure about that?
yep .
i'm not takin 'any more chances .
it's gonna take a while in this weather .
marcus?
what the fuck do we do if it doesn't arrive in time?
we'll have to think of some other way of ending this .
you either flirting with me or clocking my game 'cause you don't trust me .
i don't like your beady little eyes all over my goodies , so turn the fuck away .
you're manipulative , weak knees and that sexy copper complexion .
you're definitely an aries , baby .
you're pretty good .
smiley thanks you .
we got something in common , you know that?
you comin 'down off some shit , ain't ya?
don't be ashamed , man .
don't be ashamed .
what's your poison?
seconal to bring me down .
adderall to bring me back up .
you gotta get up to get down .
oh , yeah , baby .
oh , yeah .
all right .
that's enough .
come on .
let's pay attention .
i want a cigarette so bad .
stupid new year's resolutions .
hey , gangster , you make any resolutions?
hmm?
what do you think , secretary?
oh , my god .
i can't stop thinking about sex .
i mean , i usually think about sex a lot , but this is crazy .
sex and death are very closely related .
the greeks called it eros and thanatos ... love and death .
or sex as a way of nullifying thoughts of dying .
what's your deal , gangster?
you actually been shot five times?
six .
you really pull a man's spine out?
it was an adam's apple .
if you ever get into tussles , secretary , you grab a man by his throat , hmm?
dig it?
and then you squeeze .
i guarantee you he will drop .
he will not get up for quite some time .
oh , god .
it's really quiet out there now .
yeah .
that's what worries me .
we're not gonna make it till morning .
marcus duvall will not allow it .
we've got eight people covering six entry points .
if we work together , we will make it .
look at it this way .
that's me out there .
you think i'd let you survive until the morning?
we don't have a lot of options here .
well , we got to figure something ,
'cause i'm not gonna stay here all night waitin 'to get killed .
if you use the situation to try and escape , it's about me and you ,
'cause when this is over , you're goin 'back to jail .
relax , sergeant .
" relax .
this ain't about me and you .
not yet .
our shit's on pause , huh?
yeah .
our shit's on pause .
you saved my ass back there .
why?
everyone in here is my responsibility .
it's my job .
that's noble .
unfortunately , i don't share the sentiment .
i see a cop in jeopardy , he's on his own , unless it benefits me to jump in for the save .
listen .
i don't try to be anything i'm not .
that ain't gonna change ; i don't care what day it is .
you remember that , sergeant .
hey . !
someone's comin '.
oh , god .
it's capra , sarge !
you know this guy?
he's a cop .
he works here .
they'll execute him .
capra !
shh !
yeah .
drive .
drive !
oh , my god .
he's gonna make it .
he still has to get by the sniper .
come on , capra . !
he's still moving .
they didn't get him yet .
where are you going?
come on .
come on .
come on , capra . !
come on . !
come on !
what the fuck is goin 'on?
who's fuckin 'shootin 'at us , sarge?
who the fuck are all these people?
what are you doin'here , capra?
what are you doin'here?
it's new year's eve .
i knew you'd be here alone .
i came to have a drink with iris .
you picked the wrong night to make your move , baby , believe me .
you know , that's really sweet .
that's really sweet , but , unfortunately , i don't believe a fuckin 'word of it .
put that goddamn weapon down , you psycho !
he works here !
i don't care that he fuckin 'works here , man .
he could be a plant .
no , jasper .
put the gun down , all right?
let's not start that again , all right?
he comes here in the guise of courting that lady .
it's a fuckin'ingenious plan .
they get one of their boys in here and then take us out one by one by one .
come on .
tell 'em .
they shot at him .
all right?
they shot at him .
oh , yeah , yeah , yeah .
oh , but they conveniently fuckin 'missed , didn't they?
the act is a fuckin 'charade !
come on .
tell 'em .
he's fuckin 'right , anna .
isn't it a fucking charade?
do i have a gun?
do i have a fucking gun?
i can't hurt you .
it's not fuckin 'good enough , rat bitch .
come on .
just lock him up , man , so he doesn't do any damage .
come on .
come on , roenick .
listen to me , man .
we're not lockin'this man up .
not in my precinct , all right?
i vouch for him .
okay .
okay , i'm fuckin 'sorry , but your authority has been super fuckin 'seded .
you understand?
you're not in charge anymore .
right , bish?
bish , tell 'em .
he could be one of them , man , so fuckin'easily .
you don't think we see right through you?
fuckin'believe that shit?
comes in here playing that game , playing stupid .
you don't think we know?
right , man?
let's do the math .
let's put him away , man , just play it safe , you know?
put it down .
no , no , no .
come on .
come on , man .
come on .
just do the math .
come on .
motherfucker comes in like that , playing ...
come here .
sergeant roenick is in charge .
understand?
yes .
let's go .
only because i respect you .
but i still say this shit is fuckin 'lllogical bullshit , all right?
he may not be who he says he is .
just mull that shit over .
think it over .
think it over , man .
iris , look after capra , fill him in on what's goin 'on .
all right , capra?
just be cool so no one else here gets spooked .
everybody else , back to your positions .
thank you .
don't .
that was self preservation .
the more men we have , the better chance we stand .
are you sure you vouch for this man?
i do .
come with me .
you know , i hate to admit it , but smiley agrees with what you said back there .
smiley want a fuckin 'medal?
hear me out , man .
look , we're out of our shackles for what?
the last time in the next 15 , 20 years?
all right , man .
get to the point .
what do you want?
listen to me , man .
look out that window .
that's freedom , baby .
get what i'm sayin '?
look , maybe this new year's can bring something different for us after all .
beck like smiley now .
eight months ago he loses his team when a deal goes sour .
problem with drugs and alcohol since the incident .
burned out cop .
only a matter of time before he drops his guard .
watch the truck .
they'll eye it as a way out .
what's the word on the a. v.?
storm's starting to let up , so it shouldn't be long now .
good .
someone gets inside , takes off , goes for help .
it's too obvious .
we'd need a distraction .
we also need the keys .
your cop said he dropped 'em in the snow .
i could hot wire a car .
i thought you never committed a crime in your life?
i haven't .
yeah .
just picked up some shit along the way .
whoa .
hold on .
how do we know she's not just gonna drive out of here and leave us all here to die?
who the fuck are you , miss fuckin 'little skirt?
shake that skinny ass in somebody else's face .
okay , anna .
no offense , but i'll feel better if somebody goes with you .
maybe i should go .
i promise i'll make her get help .
scout's honor .
it's either me orjasper .
can't be .
we need your guns .
it's gotta be ...
me .
me .
you?
shoot .
hey , i'll go .
i'll do it .
what?
it's the only thing that makes sense , right?
whatever .
whatever the fuck ever .
let's just do this .
come on .
me and ... me and the doc .
fine .
okay .
what?
it's the right move , sergeant .
i know that .
all right .
all right .
i'm the doctor , right?

you can handle that?
yes .
you can?
i don't know .
i don't know .
but i have to try , okay?
no .
no .
please .
i have to go .
i have to do it .

those two skels are buggin 'out , just like i told you they would .
they torched the bus for a diversion , i guess .
come on !

they're gonna get themselves killed .
they're dead already .
we can use this .
very smart .
they knew we'd expect them to make for the car .
free life , baby !
we did it .
yeah .
i told ya .
happy new year .
now , how are we gonna get the fuck out of here?
visual on two men .

i will bite your little white head right the fuck off !
forty five , 54 , 63 , 72 , 81 , 90 , 9 , 18 , 27 , 36 , 45 ...

the skels are dead .
we don't have a goddamn chance , do we?
sarge .
sarge .
god fucking damn it , the five of us can't hold them back .
they're gonna take out each and every one of us .
what are we supposed to do , sarge?
what are we supposed to do?
what the fuck are we supposed to do?
i don't know .
what do you wanna do , marcus?
how many inside?
uh ... [ inhales deeply ]
a hundred .
answer the question .
you're a brave woman .
what do you want to do with the body , marcus?
bishop's men were responsible for all this , remember?
let's get this thing done .
time's up , sergeant .
last stand .
your gun would be appreciated .
why did i let her go?
i know a lot about dying , sergeant .
there are two ways you can handle it : with the self pity or without it .
fuck you .
get out of my office .
i see you've made your decision .
sun's almost up .
whatever duvall's gonna do , he's gonna do now .
we need to get ready , or we'll be trapped .
now , who the fuck asked you?
you know , i've had all the shit i'm gonna take from you , old man .
hey , fuck you , dealer .
no .
fuck with me .
i should've fucked with you ...
enough !
bishop's right .
jasper , you just watch the front here .
iris , the cell block .
capra , you're on .
take the back stairs .
bishop and i'll roam , coverin'all the other entrances .
hey .
what were you doing by the back door?
what were you doing?
what the fuck are you talking about?
i saw you .
what did you tell 'em?
why didn't you let 'em inside?
hmm?
what's the plan?
aah !
what's goin 'on?
you were wrong .
he's workin'for duvall .
he removed the handcuffs from the back door .
what's the plan?
answer me . !
fuck . !
i'm a fuckin'police officer . !
i don't have to fuckin'answer you . !
what's the plan , officer?
oh , so it's about you and me now , huh , sergeant?
it's not about me and you .
not yet .
what were you doin 'by the back door , capra?
it wasn't me , jake .
what's the plan?
i wasn't there .
we let 'im live once .
he almost got us killed .
we let him live twice , we deserve to die .
you and i are friends , jake .
you gonna do this to me?
what is the plan?
there is no fucking plan !
don't make me fucking kill you !
what the fuck are you doin 'to him?
listen !
they're coming !
a. v. 5 , getting into position .
ten seconds to target .
what the fuck are they doin 'up there?
what do you think?
save your ammo .
we don't know where they are .
we need to make a move outside .
that's what they'd want us to do .
yeah .
they'll pick us off , one by one .
jake , i found a way out !
down in the basement .
all right , iris , capra .
all right .
go .
bishop , i need you .
come on .
come on .
it's an old sewer tunnel .
why didn't you mention it before?
i didn't think of it .
we've been a little bit busy .
i don't even know where it goes .
of course , we can always stay here .
it doesn't matter .
goodjob , jasper .
okay .
we need to move .
fire department'll be here soon .
here it is .
all right .
it's all clear .
everybody up .
come on , jasper .
thanks .
son of a bitch !
jake !
all right .

me and the secretary are going bye bye .
you don't follow , she don't get hurt .

my apologies , secretary .
apology not fuckin 'accepted .
hold it right there . !
drop your fuckin'weapons right now . !

how the hell did they find us?
oh , my god .
it was jasper at the back door .

fuck you , jake !
goddamn it .
i told you , " just let 'em have the son of a bitch .
nobody else gets hurt .
'cause i ain't dyin 'for that piece of shit !
or for you either , jake .
i thought you were a cop .
go in the truck , jas .
you don't need to see this .
bishop , you should've taken that deal .
these men aren't cops , sergeant .
they're criminals .
they're killers , just like me .
ain't that right , old man?
yeah , that's right .
that's right .
you're goddamn right , you son of a bitch !
not with your weapon .
give me a clean piece .
goddamn it !
give me a clean piece !
close your eyes .

motherfucker !
fuck you !
you fuckin 'bitch !
hello , sergeant .
what the hell are you still doin 'here?
marcus duvall still lives .
for me , this is unacceptable .
so our shit's back on pause .
is that it?
yeah .
we have a problem .
duvall and his men can see us .
we can't see them .
i'll draw their fire .
their muzzle flashes will give away their position .
don't miss , bishop .
run fast , sergeant .
call roenick .
who's roenick?
hurts like a bitch , doesn't it?
call roenick .
tell him i'm dead .
you know me , marcus .
i cannot tell a lie .
look at you .
when i first approached you 10 years ago , you couldn't look me in the eye .
one of them nervous , god fearin 'types .
now you put a bullet in me , no hesitation .
you're quite the changed man this new year's , marcus .
now , for the last fucking time , call him .
he doesn't have to .
drop your weapon . !
what are you waitin 'for?
shut up !
put the gun down , duvall .
what are you gonna do?
shoot me?
arrest me?
you gonna kill a cop?
there's only one cop here .
now put the goddamn gun down .
you're caught .
how many more people are you gonna kill tonight?
as many as it takes .
you make me fuckin 'sick .
aw !
aw , fuck !
aw , fuck !
ow . !
uh uh .
so it's about that time , huh?
looks that way , don't it?
well , thanks .
for what?
you didn't call my name .
that was self preservation , sergeant , and it worked .
i told ya .
i'm not gonna change .
you try to follow me , you'll find out just how true that is .
you're not gonna get very far .
i'll manage .
well , you take care of yourself , sergeant .
i will find you .
no other cop .
just me .
jesus .
sarge?

we have some questions for you , sergeant .
i'd like to get this wound looked at first .

there's nobody else .
just me and ... and them .
let me get you on a stretcher .
no .
no , man .
it's all right .
i'm walkin 'out of here .
oh , geez .
do you think we have to show up at the new precinct tomorrow?
shit .
this is fucking tempting .
no .
don't break your resolution , huh?
give me one .
i didn't make that promise .
you know , sarge , i didn't even recognize you tonight .
you were like a whole different bad ass motherfucker back there , huh?
mm .
you think so?
yeah .
well , get used to it .
happy new year , sarge .
krs one 'bout to wreck thejoint
our scene opens up at the edge of detroit
where the cops go beyond the laws
where enemies work together by puttin'their shit on pause
so what does it mean assault on precinct 13
you about to see just what the dirt brings
it's working that force i have been searching
laurence fishburne when it's time to hurt things

as i walk through the street my spirit will speak to those i meet and greet from week to week
i am not on my hands and feet i command to speak as the observer inside the physique
many rappers tried to compete of course
but they got smashed and trashed in the streets and tossed
sometimes i think we all just lost wejust flashin'across in a disastrous course
we don't even know the oneness of the only force
instead of a golden calf we got a platinum horse
what did moses do with the golden calf
threw the lord at it and it ended in a blast
master , you wanna quit we'll run faster
in the background , you burnin ''cause it's nothin'but laughter
i tag shirts like the shirt king turn up the track for assault on precinct 13
we gettin'up outta here " " that's the stuff , that's the stuff
watch me back up the truck you livin'with a lot of fear
that's the stuff , yes they are " " two crooked cops you backin'me up
we gettin'up outta here " " that's the stuff , that's the stuff
watch me back up the truck you livin'with a lot of fear " " that's the stuff , yes they are

watch me back up the truck you livin'with a lot of fear " " that's the stuff , yes they are
two crooked cops , you backin'me up we gettin'up outta here
that's the stuff , that's the stuff " " watch me back up the truck
you livin'with a lot of fear " " that's the stuff , yes they are
two crooked cops you backin'me up
