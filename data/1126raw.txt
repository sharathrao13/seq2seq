lean forward .
lean forward .
yes , yes ...
see?
this shows interest .
it's a good thing .
" if he leans backwards ...
you won't sell anything . ... you're losing him " .
buying and selling .
buying and selling , but with the body .
see?
clearly , clearly .
this is it , the world has changed .
i we don't move forward , we move backwards .
if we don't update our methods we are lost .
yeah , right .
hey , fatty , fatty , come here .
come here , please .
ok .
you're a few ibs .
overweight .
are you or not?
when you start asking questions ...
no , listen , what if i told you can lose those pounds ... ... in a week?
you want to sell something .
you needn't suffer , go on diet ... ... what would you say?
you want to sell something .
listen , would you like to lose 13 pounds in a week?
fuck off .

about 3 years ago ... ... a new sheriff came ... ... to fitz roy , chief cifuentes .
he had nothing better to do in fitz roy ... ... so he decided to call all the people who drove cars ... ... and ask them for their driving license .
so i had to go to deseado ... ... to get it .
it was a long trip , so i took uglyface with me ... ... to keep me company .
when i got there , i had to read ... small letters .
i could hardly see them .
when i was going back ... ... the sun was on my face ... ... i couldn't see anything ... ... it blinded me .
suddenly i run a guy over .
didn't see him .
sometimes it's fate .
i couldn't think clearly .
so i left him there ... ... on the road .
that was when uglyface ... ... got mad at me .
he howled all night long .
in the morning he was gone .
don't you want to lie down?
no .
have you got a place to stay?
no , but don't worry .
there's a shack here , sometimes i sleep there .
go to bed now ...

thanks , fermin .

the dog left because of what i did .
i saw the way he looked at me .
impossible , he's just a dog .
he's the only one who knows who i am .
