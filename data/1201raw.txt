goldi

travelling's scary these days .
met a shrink on the train once .
told me i had the oedipus complex .
like , i'd been wanting to do it with ma .
so i showed him the picture of my ma .
he split .
just like pop did .
as soon as he took a good look at ma and rode it clean into a lamppost on his bike .
just like that .
boom .
that's where i get my looks from .
pop .
well , i am taller .
pop was ...

let me guess ... ... " winnie the pooh "?
forensic medicine
do you know what causes body decay?
bacteria .
they decompose complex proteins into simple ones ...
and when it's as hot as in here , a body starts rotting really fast ...
you're boring the gentleman , bubbles .
on the contrary .
it's most interesting .
may i ...?
some typical symptoms of decay are ... accumulation of putrid gases ... " ... " which cause the swelling of the abdomen ...
... the lips turn greenish black ...
... " tongue , protruding due to inward pressure " .
i'm feeling sick .
chief inspector haberek , homicide .

warsaw
the trzeci brothers " auto body shop .
at me !
you're supposed to be looking at me , you halfwit .
they are supposed to look like me !
but you two look exactly the same ...
no two people are exactly the same .
everyone is special .
if 10 per cent out of 80 million germans are homeowners , how many gardens that anxiously await our dwarves does that make?
well ... 8 million .
my point exactly !
8 million dwarves !
even michaelangelo never had an opportunity like this .
you better appreciate it !
will you stop smoking?
i don't want to get lung cancer .
oh , chill it .
we've two separate sets of lungs , thank god .
here you are !
at last .
everything ok?
i'm afraid not exactly , boss .
you , michaelangelo !
go powder your nose , will you?
excuse me?
get the fuck out of here !
well , we got inside the church .
through a window .
the flashlight gave out on us , so we had to make do with a lighter .
i got burn blisters all over my fingers .
to the point , you idiot !
the point is , it was dark .
so i say to dizel ,
braille style stealing won't cut it .
but we'll find some loot by the altar " .
and sure enough we did .
we've found these .
they are used in holy mass , you retards .
take it easy .
you make my blood pressure go up .
so where's the madonna?
you couldn't even start a decent fire with it !
termites haven't been feasting on that madonna for 600 years for nothing !
it's the 600 years that make it so bloody precious !
i was going to stuff the madonna in a dwarf and ship it to germany !
what the hell am i gonna do with these damn chalices?
donate them to a bavarian tavern in munich? !
you left the church , and then what?
we got to the car , but the tires were gone .
say what ...?
the tires .
somebody stole our tires .
they stole their tires ... right ...
goldi , you're a thief , aren't you?
thieves are the screw ers , not the screw ees !
they screw others , and not get screwed !
get it? !
zyggie ... !
thls is the gutter of life , not a fucking oprah book club meeting .
i told dizel to wait for the tire service to open .
and meanwhile i put the loot in the suitcase ... ... and brought it here by train .
brilliant !
needless to say , this specimen over there is my favourite .
we're lucky he hasn't started rotting yet .
considerate of him .
shows good manners .
come to visit and then go to rot?
embarrassing .
perhaps he isn't dead?
and what's this?
a manicure set?
go get some tools .
and now a news breaking story .
a naked body of an unidentified midd/ e aged man has been found in cracow ...
a pipeline ...
weird ...
i don't get it .
marian tuleja ...
central bureau of investigation ...
colonel ...
colonel?
colonel !
boss , these new tires are way cool !
great grip on ...
zyggie , i've had it up to here with you .
i run a legitimate car business , pay my taxes , send checks to children's charities .
i don't want to do time in jail because i happen to be joined at the hip to a brother who smuggles stolen masterpieces in garden dwarves and transports cbi agents 'bodies via national rail !
i've told you a thousand times they can't put you in jail , because you're the good guy .
they can't put me away either , because they would have to put you away as well .
henry , i'm the only criminal in the world they're never gonna get .
are you done?
all we have to do now is make mr. cbi and his funny papers disappear ...
well , here?
well , did you want to take him to the zoo , or something?
it was to be a deserted spot !
it's cool !
it's close to a horse riding school .
ok , goldi , say goodbye to your friend .
freeze !
it's the police !
hands up !
turn around slowly !
keep your hands up !
what are you doing here?
nothing .
gays?
no way !
there's nothing to be ashamed of .
it's all human nature .
you boys be careful in the future .
don't leave a handicapped friend all alone like that .
the world is full of perverts .
quiet .
there's nobody around .
cool .
i've got a better idea .
trust me .
waza is gonna do us in if we don't get rid of him .
what is it now?
you're going for a shave .
what the fuck ...?
we've a dead guy here and you want me to shave?
look ...
don't do much shaving these days , not anymore .
new regulations .
they say you could get alds .
but who'd get alds around here?
it's the disease of the artists .
it's simple folk around here .
rather lichen , boils , eczema .
well , maybe a touch of syphilis here and there , if someone's been really frisky .
sit still .
the phone's ringing !
eugene's barbershop , may i help you?
i'm the producer of " tarzan in poland " motion picture .
we seem to be having a problem with our gorilla .
it's a she , to be precise .
she plays tarzan's mother .
anyway , tarzan lands in the hospital after tasting our polish vodka he's a jungle boy , not used to alcohol ...
i don't get it ...
what do you want from me?
i'm getting to it .
when mom gorilla finds out , she starts losing hair .
nerves .
she practically goes bald .
you know how mothers are .
so we'd like to bring her to you for a nice , clean shave .
hello !
we'll make it worth your while !
beasts , beasts , not humans .
they want me to shave a gorilla .
time to wake up , chief .
hey , mister , wake up , mister ... !
fall in !
at attention !
booze ok , but no drugs !
be back at a quarter past !
break it up !
at ease !
where do you think you're going?
you're staying on duty !
i thought we'd end up eating him for lunch .
what are we gonna do about this shit?
a buddy of mine works in a boiler room .
busy !
i need your help !
are you blind?
i have a customer .
i'm begging you .
these are my first international manoeuvres .
everybody's going to be there .
the americans , the british , the dutch ...
i have to look good .
will you give me a pedicure?
this is a barbershop .
for men , you know !
and what do i look like to you?
but please , be quick .
i must be back before the sarge realizes
i haven't been guarding the truck .
where's that truck?
right outside .
all right .
take off your clothes and into the shower you go ...
do you want me to shower?
can't be too careful .
lichen , alds , gum disease .
all because of lack of proper hygiene .
thanks ...
that's all right .
you're back at last !
it's all taken care of .
dizel's just burning mr. cbl's papers .
you'll set out as soon as he's back !
an out of the way country church .
you are to take only the casket with the sculpture .
no chalices !
repeat !
just the casket !
no chalices !
jump !
what's up with him?
is he stoned?
no way , sarge , sir !
just booze , like you ordered , sir !
a typical moonshine crash !
get him the fuck out !
he'll sober up flying !
julek and cezar
cracow .
julek , cezar and wolter's place
what's the birdie done to you?
you , ornithologist !
bird saver !
they're shitting all over the place .
who's gonna clean up the crap?
i've grown fur like a bear .
i need to shave .
say , did you know wolter had kids?
three daughters in sopot .
it's a damn shame .
i told him not to touch these bottles .
but would he listen?
how come we have them here anyway?
dynksiarz left them here .
he's working at a cemetery now .
what does he need this shit for?
he wants to poison the dead?
it's the new service .
people are making more dough now and they have greater demands .
it's not enough to have your mother in law just dropped in the hole .
now people want their dead mummified .
what?
embalming , that's what .
they've hired this russian guy who'd supposedly embalmed lenin .
they've so much work you have to book the procedure 3 months in advance .
sneeze , and your family puts your name on the list right away .
but this is illegal !
that's why he keeps his embalming potion here .
or had kept , until wolter drank it .
so , now what?
is he gonna turn into a fucking mummy?
who knows .
it's definitely going to take some time before he starts rotting .
i need some air .
piotr west here .
marian tuleja .
i'm in cracow .
great .
i can't wait to meet you . / sti // can hard/ y be/ ieve it .
you haven't told anyone , have you?
your wife?
not a word .
cross my heart .
we'll surprise her .
i'll see you in an hour?
right .
haven't forgotten the password?
whatever gave you the idea?
you have no idea ...
well ...
in a week or so wolter would have been world famous .
why?
his real name was bill gates , but he was really shy about it?
you really are a mega moron !
he knew who fathered roo .
fathered who?
roo .
when kanga appears in the forest , she already has baby roo with her .
but she never mentions his father .
still , one can infer that some of the animals may have had something to do with it .
what animals?
are you nuts?
it's " winnie the pooh " , dickhead !
wolter came to the conclusion that ...
whoa , whoa !
hold it !
you're fucking with me , right?
why?
i find it hard to believe , that for over a year i've been sharing the apartment with a guy who wants to know who fucked a kangaroo !
fucked a kangaroo .
that's all you are able to relate to , you perv .
hey !
wait up !
oh , get fucked !
what hour's this?
i've forgotten my watch .
last winter apple trees suddenly blossomed ...
due to the ozone layer damage?
we'd love to chat , but time does fly .
he hasn't sent you?
who hasn't sent us?
never mind .
the world's full of freaks .
let's go !
so who was the father of this what's his name roo?
i don't know .
wolter didn't manage to tell me .
excuse me , where will i find jello?
on the other side .
thanks .
you're welcome .
would you be so kind ...
i'd like this box of jelly candies ...
no , not this one ... that one !
but they are all exactly the same !
if you don't mind ...
i do need that box .
there .
thank you .
the shopping's already packed , and i had to forget the brandy ... !
an old woman's weakness ...
save the excuses .
half the population drinks .
the jellies are for my granddaughter .
we're leaving for the seaside soon .
what a coincidence .
we're going to the seaside , too .
you are?
we are?
a friend has to visit his family .
excuse me ...
what family?
have you seen wolter's id?
three kids in sopot ...
wolter's lying stiff on the sofa .
oleka !
he doesn't look like someone who's missing his children !
oleka !
watch it , shitpants !
look , it's that freak ...
it's not him .
different suit .
that's no proof !
freaks are freaky .
i'm sorry .
stick it up your ass !
if you insist on being vulgar , granny shall punish you .
severely .
please don't mind him .
he's a loony .
completely loco .
why drag him there?
we could bury him here , courtesy of dynksiarz .
wolter's got family !
had !
he's dead , if you hadn't noticed !
and how are you planning
to get the body across the country?
i'll think of something .
to the family reunion !
we're broke .
i'm tired .
i'll just have my two vodka doubles , crash
next to wolter and sleep like the dead .
like the dead with the poisoned .
shut up !
it's the freak from the market !
a selfish freak , at that .
check out his wallet !
i'm an organist , not a thief !
we need the money for the trip !
oh , all right .
wait , i've got a better idea .
his suit .
for wolter's final journey .
i didn't think we were going to make it .
well , wolter , they will be really surprised to see you wearing a suit !
i wonder what's in the briefcase .
what?
perhaps we should take a peep?
later .
can you see that woman over there?
see that guy?
just wait and observe .
my bag !
catch the thief !
and the bag is fucking gone .
the world's a jungle , alas .
are we supposed to accept that?
what are we gonna do now , you idiot !
oh , we'll get him back !
but how?
let me just park my butt here , ok?
there's some thugs sitting in my car .
travelling's scary these days .
i think i've got it .
it's rabbit .
he's the father .
yeah , and you're the grandpa .
i'm telling you .
it was rabbit that'd made the little bugger .
look , as soon as kanga arrives in the forest , rabbit starts his ugly scheming .
he talks piglet and pooh into kidnapping baby roo .
and why?
we'll tell you where baby roo is , if you promise to go away from the forest and never come back
so?
what do you mean " so "?
use your cabeza , dude .
he knocked her up , and now she's come back with the kid , so he's scared shitless that she wants to claim child support .
that's why he kidnaps baby roo .
the sob .
rabbit?
lmpossible .
i'd sooner put my money on pooh .
pooh?
pooh's too childish .
all he does is guzzle honey and sing stupid songs .
give it to me !
and every tuesday roo spent the day with his friend rabbit , and every ...
... tuesday kanga spent the day with her friend pooh , teaching him to jump " .
gentlemen ...
get it?
rabbit babysits the kid all day so mommy can do some hopping around with pooh !
rich , don't you think?
bed hopping's more like it .
a sexual " little something " .
and how do you know they weren't doing it before roo was born?
but how?
she wasn't even living there ...
man , sometimes i think you were born yesterday .
gentlemen ...
i need to pee .
owl?
no way .
maybe eeyore?
such an unassuming , quiet little jackass .
i just know the kind .
they're the worst scum .
we don't have time for this !
chill .
there's always time for thls .
we're just returning from an expedition ,
tigers , ticks , snakes , you know .
stuff .
what kind of music do you like , miss ...?
morrison ... just morrison .
so we're kindred spirits .
i could tell right away .
great music , that .
i'm gonna love you and treat you right " .
marley .
my number one .
are we there yet?
my car is somewhere around here .
what rotten luck .
it broke down on us right in the middle of the woods .
us?
what do you mean " us "?
well , us .
who are you with?
a fiance?
no , a sister .
sisters .
all alone in the woods .
little red riding hoods .
and where's your precious sister?
she'll turn up .
and inspector gadget here is gonna take care of the car , right?
me?
well , who else?
me?
could you give me the keys?
a kiss ...?
i mean , car keys .
ah ... they're in the car .
jesus christ !
what's this?
a coffin .
i can see that .
but what's inside?
what do you think?
potatoes?
i used to be an organist , you know .
i was kind of partial to drink , so the vicar put a curse on me .
he said that if i kept on drinking ,
i'd go straight to hell .
you didn't believe him , did you?
i did .
i haven't touched liquor since .
i add jello to my vodka , wait until it sets , and eat it .
mind you , eat it .
not drink it .
do you think your boss , is gonna hold it against me?
if my boss appreciates brains , you have his absolution already .
what's with the skis?
they aren't ours .
they're hers .
every year she participated in the monastic winter games .
sister benedicta won the silver medal in ski jumping two days ago .
she was in top form .
and that very night she slipped and fell in the shower ...
unknown to man are the ways of god .
fame today , funeral tomorrow .
not tomorrow , but today .
and we have to make it .
nuns from all over poland are coming to pay her the last respects .
it stopped raining .
nice girls , huh?
do you think wolter is up there ... somewhere?
sandra and tuleja
the pomeranlan lake dlstrlct .
the wests " summer cabln .
you've taken viagra , haven't you?
we've been married for 5 years and you've never been this horny .
is that bad?
no .
i'm gonna take a shower ...
how many times have i told you to do something about the damn brooms !
do think it over , dear .
a marita / crisis is not the reason to ki // .
cracow one week earller .
what does your conscience say?
don't you worry about my conscience .
i've made up my mind .
as you wish .
leave the picture and the advance money in the je // y candy box .
the one / 've to/ d you about .
you '// pay the rest as a widow .
come on , darling ...
we haven't done it for a week ... or so?
well , it's been slightly longer than that .
see?
come on , then .
you'd better get yourself to bed , vicar .
computers are mighty bad for the eyes .
when so many tormented souls need consolation ...
but it's night time already .
it is here , but not in america .
don't they have priests in america?
the whole village is talking , vicar .
that vicar only does confession through this box here , and has forsaken the sheep in his own parish .
thanks to the net the whole world is my parish now .
i cannot concern myself solely with one village , when the global village is in need .
it's nothing .
probably the wind .
get out and check it out !
right now? !
well , get up and see !
out , out you go !
we were smuggling the dwarves to amsterdam once .
a sunday caught us there .
i was bored out of my mind , man .
my mug was stiff from smoking all that pot .
so i think , why not pop into a museum ...
i've been to a museum once .
it was on a school trip .
a military museum or something .
we had to wear these felt slippers .
i skidded into a cannon .
head on .
got 5 stitches .
fuck the museums , man .
but it wasn't a regular museum .
it was a sex museum !
a sex museum?
i know a broad by that name .
lives in my building .
why do you always have to interrupt me?
stop staring like an idiot !
move your ass !
we're in deep shit !
shit !
he's wearing a uniform !
is he dead?
no , he's just taking a nap .
of course he's dead !
i shot at him twice .
what are we gonna do with him?
we'll adopt him?
it's all your fault !
you couldn't just stay in bed , could you?
we must get rid of him .
how?
we'll roast him for dinner?
he's a soldier .
an army of investigators will be all over us before we know it !
wait a minute !
what's this?
your jogging tracksuit .
do you want me to go jogging now?
are you nuts?
the lake .
about 15 km from here?
we'll drop him in there .
nobody's gonna make the connection between a jogger and a missing marine .
we have to get him down .
saint anthony ready to go?
he's in the box .
i'm gonna miss him .
so many years together .
he's just going for renovation .
he'll be back as good as new .
still , it makes me sad to see him go .
we've grown used to each other .
i think i'll go in again to say good bye .
don't forget to lock the door !
as if ...
don't you " as if " me .
i know you too well .
he had no bullet marks , which means you didn't get him .
like it matters now !
how did he die then?
out of fear?
he's dead , and that's the end of it .
what's this piece of junk?
why doesn't it start?
time for a swim !
fuck !
we'll never get anywhere on this piece of crap !
the church !
what now?
push , go on , push it !
shit , his legs got all cramped from sitting in that bike .
i can't unbend them .
rest him against the confessional .
it will look more natural .
who's here?
i'd like to confess my sins , father .
but i can't ...
i'm ... ... you're my last hope .
but i ...
hear me out , or i'll be doomed forever .
i'm a terrible sinner .
i like animals .
so did st. francis .
nothing wrong with that .
but i ... like them ... too much .
don't stop them , grandma .
they're going the other way .
goldi , don't get upset .
so what did you see at the museum?
a guy with the biggest little pecker in the world !
was he working there?
no , he was in this picture .
black and white or colour?
what the fuck does it matter?
i'm telling you the guy's wiener was the size of empire state building , and you are testing my knowledge of photographic techniques?
wanna know whether the finish was glossy or matte?
come on !
if it was the size of the empire state building , it couldn't have been a " little pecker " .
it's an expression : " to have a little ...
but if ...
fine !
he had a gargantuan george !
are you happy now?
and when did you become a linguist?
see , you've made me miss the exit !
... then there was the squirrel .
but i didn't love him .
it was pure lust .
the bible says you sin if you cast but one lustful look at a woman .
squirrels ...
pray to the merciful lord , son ; you may be forgiven ...
no , you should burn in hell !
get out !
out !
didn't you hear me?
out !
now !
oh sweet mother of jesus !
see , i knew i was right to wait !
well .
where's the corpse?
he was in the casket just a minute ago .
he must have risen from the dead .
in twenty minutes 'time?
even christ himself took 3 days to do it .
and where's the casket?
up and risen from the dead too?
i smell something fishy here !
whatever is vicar implying?
i am in aa now ...
darling ...
wait ...
open your mouth ...
don't move , or i'll shoot you !
now , who the hell are you?
i am your husband !
what are you doing , darling?
i am killing you , darling .
i've wanted to do it for a long time .
please !
don't !
i'm not your husband !
no kidding !
of course you aren't !
do you think i'm an utter idiot !
who are you?
the truth !
i'm his brother !
you're lying !
piotr never had a brother !
he did .
he just didn't know about me .
our mother abandoned us .
he was adopted ... and i grew up in the orphanage .
so you killed him out of envy?
for his luck and success?
no !
that's not it !
then why?
why?
this deal is beginning to stink big time .
i want out .
konstancln near warsaw , 14 days earller
too late .
you can't pull out now .
it's not the paris dakar race .
this pipeline is a risky business .
journalists are sniffing around .
even the cbi has started an investigation .
someone is bound to put two and two together .
i'll be fucked .
what are you , a rookie?
don't you know what to do?
co op with them , destroy evidence , mess up their leads and clues .
senator , i'm just a simple cbi agent .
i've no ambition to become 007 .
it's getting too hot for my comfort .
adieu .
watch it , or i'll bid " adieu " to you .
for good .
cracow one day earller .
they say you've disappeared from warsaw .
are you avoiding me?
did you have to kill a journalist of biggest paper in the country?
you refused to help me , so i had to help myself .
the deal is off .
i want out , and i don't mean maybe .
oh , you don't?
so what are you going to do?
squeal on me to the police?
or take thee to a nunnery?
i'll get you wherever you go .
you'd have dissolve into thin air .
perhaps i will .
that's enough .
i'll kill you if you don't cooperate .
/ s that c/ ear?
you're with me or your dead .
piotr west here .
marian tuleja .
i am in cracow .
how did you guess i wasn't him?
we were identical .
not quite .
piotr was impotent .
oh , shit .
that would have never occured to me .
was that the only reason why you wanted to kill him?
isn't that enough?
i even hired a hitman .
the skydiver?
some hitman .
he wasn't that bad .
that greedy old man on the train saved your life .
the one at the buffet?
the sucker who ate my hot dogs?
god , life is beautiful , after all .
i so wanted to get rid of piotr and now , thanks to you , he's gone .
the senator will never find you .
you're piotr west now .
i'll confirm it anytime .
wait here .
i'll take a shower , and we'll renegotiate our deal .
many times over ... darling .
the man , whose naked body was found in cracow / ast night ... has been identified as piotr west , a we // known businessman .
the po/ ice are / ooking for his wife ...
mrs. sandra west , who has mysterious/ y disappeared ...
shit , zyggie !
all set .
we still have some putty left .
what am i to do with them , henry?
fire them ...
and hire that one over there .
he is nicely tranquil .
i know of some deep caves .
we could drop him in there .
oh , we'll fix it .
we still have some putty .
i think we should back out of this assignment .
why?
one the subject of elimination missing from the cabin .
two our employer found dead in the shower on the premises .
so?
don't rub so hard , or you'll leave scratch marks .
and we're not going to get the rest of the money !
do you know why people appreciate swiss watches the most?
for their consistent quality .
it's the reputation .
the brand name .
that's why i'd prefer to lose half of my pay than a client's trust .
even if he's dead .
we'll find the hubby of the late , mrs. west and we'll finish the job .
but we're not going to use poisoned hot dogs again , are we?
no , we aren't , bubbles .
we'll do it the classic way .
breathe in , breathe out .
in out .
that body double trick was smart .
who was that guy anyway?
my brother .
you killed your own brother?
you're cbi scum through and through .
it's a shame your brilliant plan fell through .
the police didn't identify him as tuleja ;
there was no cbi id , no badge .
no papers .
you should try it .
no , thanks .
it's not a recommendation .
it's an order .
my own documents were not to be found on him , either ... and they shouldn't be roaming the country .
i'll get them for you , senator .
just give me one more chance .
i've heard that some punk wanted to sell my papers to the press .
find him before they do .
yes sir !
good morning .
good morning .
miss , we're looking for a friend .
freeze !
police !
what's going on?
a bit too early for the bubbly .
now you must get rid of her .
dizel and goldi will be here any minute .
your faith in them is truly inspiring .
they just had to bring a coffin .
they can do that much , i hope .
it must be them now .
freeze .
the police !
that's it .
insalata mista !
how did they find out about the nun?
they're not here about her .
about what then?
the dwarves?
jesus , you were supposed to burn it !
well , i thought i was gonna make some dough on the side .
i'm dead meat already .
take it and get inside !
are you crazy?
i'm not dead yet !
you will be if you don't get in .
go on !
so you know nothing about my briefcase .
think hard .
i'll make you an honest offer .
how honest?
i'll honestly kill you .
painlessly .
you're kidding?
it wasn't me !
it was goldi !
are you crazy?
who?
goldi !
he works here .
he's the one with the briefcase !
where is it now?
what?
goldi?
goldi put it in the coffin , which the nuns drove away with .
i swear !
the briefcase !
don't play stupid with me !
i'm not !
it went to szamocin .
that's where the nunnery is .
they are going to bury it tonight .
there's this funeral .
shit !
what's that place called again?
szamocin .
please , don't hurt me !
death does it hurt at all?
i've located the briefcase .
i'm going there right now .
there's this goldi guy ...
what do we do about him?
yes , of course .
the documents .
they are the most important .
men are like pasta .
you turn up the heat , they go soft .
and so will you .
you poisoned the guy with hot dogs , si?
he poisoned himself .
with this balm .
are you bullshitting me?
no way .
honest .
it was the body balm .
embalming balm , to be precise .
for the dead .
perhaps there is a method in your madness ... because your situation doesn't look good .
let's see .
what have we here?
the dead guy on the train .
poisoned with hot dogs .
what's next ...?
secundo ...
two guys asking about the dead guy in question ;
the two guys carry tickets for the transfer in question .
25 years of doing time it's gonna drag on like imitation mozarella .
inspector , the papers you wanted weren't at the body shop .
but we've found another body .
of a woman ... sort of ...
leave philosophy to the superiors .
you just tell it like it is .
it's a nun , sir !
most interesting .
a case in the spiritual spheres , at last , carbonaras .
what about the perpetrators?
got them , sir !
two of them , sir !
or one .
it depends on how you look at it .
don't give me a farfalle here !
so how many are there?
well , two .
they are siamese twins .
joined at the hip .
must be all those damn chemicals .
are they talking yet?
they're doing this loony act .
they're saying they got the nun by mistake .
by mistake .
yeah , right .
they say they've exchanged her for the body sb's found on the train .
who wouldn't like to find a body on the train?
but in order to accomplish this you'd have to be me .
where's the nun?
in the van , outside .
and the siamese?
they're being questioned .
you two stay here , gorgonzola !
i'm not done with you yet .
you're the dude with the dead nun?
so what if i am?
you're fucked , that's what .
you were to report an hour ago .
haberek's gone totally bananas .
pappardelle ! " , he was yelling , i'll wring off his pappardelle !
get out of here !
we'll keep an eye on the nun .
oh , how beautiful !
szamocln the gabrlellte slsters order
i can sense dear benedicta's spirit watching from above and rejoicing !
and where is sister morrison?
you two'd better not be late again .
she's in her cell praying .
the naked man who vanda/ ized the barbershop / ast night has been identified as a marine , whose division took part in internationa / nato maneouvres recent/ y conc/ uded in po/ and .
according to the nato spokesman , the incident didn't affect the success of the operation ...
are you crazy !
men are not allowed in here !
that's why we're hanging outside !
cezar !
i can't hold on any longer !
what are you doing here?
you are not going to believe it .
even a nun's faith has some limits .
i've got a cramp !
shut up !
you have to let us inside !
absolutely not !
the wake starts in an hour !
do you have any idea what's going to be happening here?
we do , actually .
just wait till they open the coffin !
i knew i should have shaved !
oh , stop it .
you better think of what to say to mother superior !
oh , shi ... she's from the curia !
these sisters are from the curia !
the curia !
what is ailing you , sister?
we make a splendid cordial here , works wonders for toothaches .
i used to be a missionary in baghdad .
it's just ... habit , you see .
a man has penetrated inside our house !
it has never happened before !
i'm not a man .
i'm a cbi officer .
you are in serious danger , and so is our country .
what's the matter?
this is strictly confidential information .
but where is this danger located?
where did you get this?
charity .
do you think it will be big enough for him?
god willing ...
did you miss me?
because i did ...
jesus ...
quick !
there's no time to lose !
or you will be burying me in a moment !
wolter ...
please forgive me .
hey , why is he wearing a tracksuit?
he's been jogging?
with a briefcase?
i hear footsteps !
hurry up !
they're almost here !
it's too late !
just push him under the catafalque !
the briefcase !
from this moment on everything you see is strictly confidential .
you know , like confession , of sorts .
we don't do confession , colonel .
please take what's yours and get out .
raise the cover , sister .
shit !
what do you think you're doing? !
get your paws away from her !
it must be here somewhere !
is this your confidential material , you pervert?
i can explain !
no , let me explain something to you !
don't just stand there !
do something !
fucking taliban !
oh , no !
thank you !
i've got the papers !
this goldi guy?
no , not yet .
as you wish .
he's dead meat anyway .
the guy pawing sister benedicta is the same freak who asked us the weird question about apple trees in blossom .
you were right , he's nuts .
what's wrong?
i'm just tired .
it was crowded , and the nuns kept singing all night long .
wait this must be it .
let go of me !
i'm so very ... very sorry ...
i'm sorry times three .
a salesman?
we don't need anything !
madam , forgive me , but i must be blunt .
your husband is dead .
what's up?
the chicken soup's getting cold .
i've no idea .
oh , i see .
life abhors vacuum , doesn't it?
a poet or something?
give him some money and get back to the table .
he's no poet .
he's a nut .
he says you're dead .
let me take care of that .
so i'm dead , eh?
can you hear the song tonight , my sweet pame/ a?
can you hear the distant cry of the guitars?
oh , the boys from our pueb/ o , they are singing their / ast song before they / eave this mean o/ d town
hunger's driving us away from empty pampa
where opuntias'prick/ y spikes pierce scorching skies .
we are / eaving for the city , sweet pame/ a to / ook for the dai/ y bread and lady luck ...
now what?
poland's run out on us !
it's a fake .
i should have noticed it earlier .
do you remember when wolter was working at " exotica " night club?
this guy here is a truck driver .
he'd lost his id in " exotica " .
i'd like an ice cream , please .
beat it , fatso !
go jogging instead !
man , we have to do something about wolter .
seems kind of retarded storing a pal in a mobile ice cream box .
we have to bury him .
i know .
but where?
on the beach?
any other ideas?
i have one !
warsaw
dearly beloved .
misery loves company .
two days ago we said goodbye to adas dizel .
today we bid our last farewell to our friend emil karpatka ,
aka goldi .
the ruthless hand of death reaped this young life far too soon .
what are you doing here , colonel?
working up an appetite before dinner?
don't get smart with me .
if it were up to me , you would never have got out as long as you lived .
well , like you said .
it isn't up to you .
do you know my brother?
a very honest man .
he's depressed .
did you know goldi?
a wonderful boy .
i was like a father to him .
and i like an uncle .
a most terrible thing .
poisoned with some russian concoction .
let me introduce , my new employee wolter .
he's replaced goldi , may he rlp .
where to , boss?
to the clinic , you moron .
he pulled out a gun , and ...
watch it , shitpants !
i warned you .
granny is going to punish you .
no , no !
i'm telling you !
it's tigger !
we were such retards not to have seen it right away !
tigger?
he's so immature !
all he ever does is bounce !
exactly !
so he could have bounced kanga .
he's her roommate after all .
only because she gives him cod liver oil .
maybe it's christopher robin .
somehow i never liked the sob .
would you give me a shave?
i would appreciate it if you left these premises immediately .
excuse me?
get the fuck out of here !
fuck shaving .
i'm growing a beard .
whatever .
you're ugly anyway .
it's rabbit !
rabbit !
you're ugly yourself !
it's tigger !
it's not tigger !
it's rabbit !

wolter ...
please forgive me ...
hey , why is he wearing a tracksuit?
he's been jogging?
hurry up !
action !

do it with the eyes !

i've been out .
but not to murder .
to pee .
to pee?
of course .
what else?
fettuccine ...
action !
stop !
action !
good morning .
miss , we're looking for a friend .
we seem to have lost him .
actually , we've lost his body .
he's got these bulging eyes ...
we'd like to inquire ... perhaps you know where he might be?
yes , no problem .
please wait here .
thank you .
police?

two suspects .
yes .
oh , two bozos .
