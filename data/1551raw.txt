sister viridiana .
i've just had a letter from your uncle .
he won't be able to come when you take your vows .
all right , mother .
you don't seem to mind very much .
i hardly know him .
i saw him only once , some years ago .
in any case he's asking you to come and stay with him .
i don't want to leave the convent , mother .
i'm afraid that his health is not good .
he's your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows .
but why does he want to see me?
he has never bothered about me .
he has paid for your studies , and he has just sent your dowry .
does that mean so little to you , viridiana?
i have no desire to see the world again , but if you order me to ...
the retreat will start soon .
you can leave tomorrow morning .
everything you need for the journey has been put in your cell .
try to show him some affection .
that's enough for today , rita .
do you like that rope i gave you?
it's easier to jump with , it's got handles .
go and play .
leave it .
good day .
hello .
welcome , miss .
i'm ramona , don jaime's servant .
pleased to meet you .
viridiana !
excuse me .
how are you uncle?
i'm well ...
the bus was late , wasn't it?
what was the journey like?
excellent .
what a charming , peaceful place , uncle .
you'll think you're still at the convent .
how long are you staying?
i've been given permission to stay only a few days .
was that difficult to get?
no .
mother superior told me to come .
did you have so little interest in seeing me?
to tell you the truth , not very much .
i cannot lie .
i respect you and i am grateful to you , but otherwise ...
you have no feelings toward me ...
no .
you are right .
being alone has made me self centered .
unfortunately , it's too late now , isn't it?
yes .
it's too late .
you've been neglecting the farm , uncle .
these past 20 years , weeds have invaded everything .
there are spiders all over the house except on the first floor .
i hardly ever go out .
it's true .
when he goes out he makes me jump rope .
come down here , you scamp !
who is she?
my maid ramona's daughter .
come down .
she's a little animal .
how like your aunt you are , even in your walk .
i know , you've told me that already .
incredible , even the voice .
she has made her bed on the floor , sir !
she has something in her suitcase that looks like thorns .
her nightgown is made of some rough cloth .
it really must tear her skin !
such beautiful skin , sir .
leave me now .
you can go to bed .
yes , sir .
good night .
good morning , moncho .
good morning .
good morning , rita .
how are we today?
today , a good girl .
could i trouble you for my glass of milk?
certainly , miss .
is that difficult?
not at all .
here , try it yourself .
but i wouldn't know how .
sit down there .
pull harder !
squeeze hard !
keep quiet !
grab it .
don jaime is very good at it !
get out of there !
no !
get me those buckets over there .
don't be afraid , miss .
i'll guide you .
come on , pull !
no i can't .
i saw you in your nightgown !
what?
yes , yes , i saw you !
don't take her seriously , she's a liar .
i saw her !
when she was dressing , her pins fell out and she picked them up .
how did you see me?
from the terrace .
it's not nice to spy .
coming to the hen house with me?
no , i don't want to .
thanks .
hello !
good morning , uncle .
you're very early this morning .
so that i can see a little bit more of you .
i'm going to make you a nun's cake .
it will make your mouth water .
you are spoiling me too much .
i won't know what to do with myself when you've gone .
only because you want it .
what do you mean?
nothing .
i didn't say anything .
you don't trust me , do you?
what do you want to know?
very well !
i can't keep things to myself .
is it true that you have a son?
how did you know about that?
i heard my mother talking about it once .
but is it true?
yes , it is .
what do you know about life?
you couldn't possibly understand .
you should have brought up the child .
his mother wanted to keep him .
she came from a poor family .
i was in love with your aunt .
i would like to have acknowledged him but i was afraid of losing her .
that's why i didn't say anything .
and this innocent child?
don't worry .
he won't be forgotten .
you must think i am a monster .
no , but what a pity life is like that .
it was going to drown .
who's there?
is she up yet?
she's been up for some time .
she asked me to get her things ready .
her last day in this house !
i'll never see her again if she leaves .
why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?
i have asked her but she's ungrateful .
sometimes i feel like hitting her .
when i talk to her about the convent , she turns to stone .
come here , ramona .
sit down .
i'm going to need your help .
what's the matter?
sit down .
sit down , woman .
you like me , don't you?
i'd be really ungrateful , if i didn't .
you took me and my little girl in when i didn't know where to turn .
yes , yes , but there's no need to bring that up .
how far are you prepared to help me?
just say the word , sir , and i'll do anything .
why don't you speak to her , ramona?
women are good at that sort of thing .
think of something that will make her stay a few more days .
you are kind , ramona !
speak to her .
i know i don't need to offer you anything , but if you're successful in this
i'll not forget you or your little girl .
why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?
you're right , but we must do something .
you must think of something , and i'll help you to my utmost .
look in the cupboard .
on the upper shelf , there's a little blue bottle .
there's no label on it .
you'll find some white pills inside .
this one , sir?
yes , leave it there .
go on with your work .
i'll tell you what to do later .
thank you .
i have never been able to do that .
why didn't you wake me?
they say it's dangerous .
i don't believe it .
a few years ago , the last time i sleepwalked , they woke me up by slapping my face .
and you can see i'm still alive .
what worries me is that i put ashes on your bed .
why?
it's no more odd than anything else .
people who walk in their sleep don't know what they're doing .
ashes mean penance ... and death .
then it's penance for you who are going to be a nun and for me , who am old , it's death .
i'll come with you to the village when you leave tomorrow .
thank you , uncle .
this evening we must do something special by way of a farewell .
whatever you like .
i would like you to do something for me .
today i can refuse you nothing .
you'll do what i ask , then?
whatever you wish .
i'm at your command .
no , wait ...
what a silly thing !
it's quite difficult for me to tell you what it is .
how strange you are !
when i asked you to do this favor for me you refused .
and now , here you are , making me so very happy all of a sudden .
thank you , my child !
i don't like masquerading but i decided to give in to your whim .
it's not a masquerade , nor is it a whim .
i'm going to tell you a secret .
your aunt died in my arms , on our wedding night wearing that dress .
you look so like her ...
you must think i'm mad .
no uncle , and now i'm pleased to have been able to do this favor , because , although i didn't think so at first , you are really a good man .
if you only knew ...
when i was young i was full of idealism .
i wanted to do something on a big scale for others , something to show my great love for humanity .
but as soon as i tried to do something about it ,
i became afraid that i would be laughed at and i felt like a fool ... and so i went back into my shell .
wasn't that cowardice?
no , it isn't that .
i wouldn't be afraid in the face of real danger .
i've proved that to myself .
on the other hand , if a stranger visited me simply to say hello ,
i'd be alarmed .
i can't take my eyes off you .
come , let's sit down .
uncle , you mustn't think that i won't be sad to leave you .
it's up to you entirely .
don't leave , then ...
unfortunately ...
it's my fault .
if i'd come to see you more often , invited you here for holidays , maybe everything would be different .
maybe ...
there's one way you could stay .
if i asked ...
i mean , if i said to you ...
no , i can't ...
what he wants , miss , is to marry you .
excuse me , sir , but i only said what you didn't dare say yourself .
he loves you very much and he deserves to be loved in return , because he is a very good man .
you're really serious?
yes .
i don't want you ever to leave this house .
you must be out of your mind .
i've been so happy these last few days ...
now you've spoiled it all .
i think it would be better if i went to my room .
wait !
forgive me !
stay a few more minutes !
if you go now , i'm afraid you'll always resent me .
i promise not to say anything that might annoy you .
i'll put some music on and we'll have a cup of coffee .
miss , take this , it'll do you good .
why are you crying?
i'm afraid .
don't invent stories , go to bed .
a black bull came .
a black bull !
it's a very big one .
very?
yes , very big !
he couldn't get through the door , then?
then how did it get in , silly?
he came in through the cupboard .
you little liar !
get out of here !
i'm afraid .
here !
and call your mother if you're having nightmares .
now go away and don't annoy me .
you look very tired .
perhaps you'd better go to bed .
don't think too badly of me , ramona .
i only want to have her close to me .
that will be all , ramona .
what are you doing?
don jaime was kissing the lady .
he only kisses her because she's his niece .
don't i kiss you?
you should be in bed .
a black bull came into my room .
be quiet .
i'm going to put you to bed .
i'm thirsty .
how do you feel?
i have a headache .
that will soon pass .
it's nothing .
what happened to me?
you fainted last night after supper .
the master and i carried you here .
have i slept long?
you slept well , don't worry .
give me some water .
leave us alone , ramona .
don't go !
leave .
please , i beg you .
i want to get up .
no .
you can never go away now .
last night you promised never to speak of that again .
an old man who lives alone and a young woman consecrated to god .
what could be more unlike?
be quiet !
don't you understand that i want to get dressed?
i forgot everything because of you , even the passion that has kept me going all these years .
leave !
get up !
i must have been mad .
i thought that you would agree to marry me , but naturally you refused .
and now it's the day that you must leave .
i had to force you .
that was the only way i could find to have you in my arms .
you're lying .
last night when you were sleeping , i had you all to myself .
now you won't be able to go back to your convent .
you're not the same woman who left it a few days ago .
now , you'll have to stay with me here forever .
everything i have will be yours .
even if you don't want to marry me , your presence here will be enough .
think about it .
don't hurry .
think it over .
go away !
leave me alone .
what did you say to her , sir?
the way she looked at me , ramona !
she hates me now .
i think i've made a great mistake .
she's going away and nothing will stop her .
speak to her again .
explain everything to her seriously .
what for?
she'll only look at me that way again ...
i couldn't .
you go .
perhaps she'll listen to you .
try to convince her .
but what can i say to her , sir?
tell her i lied , that i didn't take advantage of her .
i did mean to do it , ramona .
but i realized in time what i was doing .
i spent the whole night turning my thoughts over in my mind ... and i lied to her so she wouldn't go back to the convent .
tell her that .
go on , explain to her .
sir , come right away .
let me pass !
you must listen to me before you go .
i've listened to you long enough .
let me out .
all that i said just now was a lie .
i said it so you wouldn't leave .
i only molested you in my thoughts ...
i can't bear to have you leave me , hating me like this .
tell me you believe what i'm saying .
you disgust me ... even if what you say is true .
then you won't forgive me?
you believe me , don't you?
yes , sir .
don't lie .
you don't believe me either .
it's all very odd , sir .
it's all right , my girl , it's all right .
it didn't work this time , but you'll see .
now it will .
look how high it is !
let me have a little peace , won't you?
if i hadn't dropped it ...
when you're ready , miss .
i'll take your bag , miss .
how do you do , miss viridiana !
is anything the matter , mr. mayor?
you cannot leave ...
why not?
there's been an accident .
where?
come with me .
he's over there .
give it to me .
it's mine !
i'll slap you if don't show some respect for the dead !
you mustn't play under this tree .
don jaime loved to watch me skip .
if something terrible happens now it will be your fault .
you aren't eating enough .
i've brought you a glass of milk .
this evening i'll bring you some meat .
you don't look at all well !
the mayor told me that he's taking care of your problems .
you can go to the village when you want to .
it'll do you good to see the world .
a visitor , miss .
leave us , ramona .
good morning .
you weren't expecting me , were you?
mother .
you must have suffered , my child !
i was worried .
ever since yesterday , when we heard about the tragedy , we have been very anxious for you .
i took the first train with mother consuelo .
why didn't you write?
i would have come immediately .
i had so many things to think about ...
you should have told me .
i talked for a few minutes to the parish priest in the village and he told me how it happened .
everybody is asking why this horrible offense was committed against our lord .
do you know the reason?
i only know that my uncle was a grave sinner and i feel guilty for his death .
how can you say that !
you , responsible for the suicide of a man?
i want a complete confession from you .
i'm not going back to the convent .
therefore i'm no longer under obedience to anyone .
is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows?
there must be something .
i have nothing to reproach myself for .
all i know is that i've changed .
with all my strength , which is not much , i will follow the road that the lord has shown me .
are you aware of the pride there is in what you're saying?
what great plans are you thinking of dedicating yourself to now?
i know my own weakness , and whatever i do will be humble .
but , however little it is , i want to do it alone .
very well .
as you won't let me help you , i must leave you .
i'm very sorry i came and disturbed you .
goodbye .
mother !
forgive me if i have offended you .
you are forgiven .
goodbye .
why isn't she coming?
she has already crossed herself .
she's a very firm believer .
i've heard she's even going to pay us to go and live with her .
kind people !
don't forget a poor blind man .
an alms for a sick blind man .
be generous !
there she is .
no more hanging around here for you , and fighting with the kids .
give the little girl to me .
come here , sweetheart .
are you ready?
when you are , miss .
good , then let's go !
she has the face of an angel .
what a pity you can't see her .
keep the compliments to yourself .
i don't like them .
here they come .
are you the other two?
yes , miss , that's us , yes .
good , come with me .
what a strange man !
i wish i knew what he was like .
as far as you're concerned , worthless .
you can see how much he cared about you .
i'm not at all bitter about it .
anyone can love and forget .
why did he acknowledge me at the last moment?
he was very good .
better than some people would think .
why did he kill himself?
i don't know , sir .
one shouldn't be alone the whole time .
i'm not like him , am i?
not in that way .
you're always looking for company .
why do you say that?
i know what i mean .
don't play , sir .
i beg your pardon , sir .
the master used to play here a lot .
it was a real delight to listen to him .
if you don't mind , i'll go get the other suitcase .
look at these beautiful fields !
and behind those pines the fields , dried up and abandoned .
there's so much to do here and it's all mine .
we won't have time to get bored .
aren't you happy?
yes .
yes .
but i don't know ...
i wish i hadn't come .
look at that .
it's very big ...
so much the better .
we'll all fit .
how many floors are there?
two .
are there many windows?
lots .
it's got balconies and two big towers .
then it's a respectable house .
have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
they shut all right now .
and the blankets are ready .
show them the rooms .
that miss is as good as gold .
she's very good , but a bit of a simpleton .
the men will sleep on one side , the women on the other .
we will eat together .
we'll try to get you some decent clothes tomorrow .
viridiana !
miss ...
are you jorge?
jorge , don jaime's son , at your service .
i've been expecting you .
i got a letter from the lawyer .
this is lucia , she's a good girl .
what's your name?
don't touch me !
you're going to sleep in the farmyard with the chickens !
get moving !
anyone who pokes around where he shouldn't be will pay for it .
although we may be poor , every man has his dignity , brother .
don't " brother " me , there is no scum in my family .
well now , even the servants put on airs here .
do you want me to smash your face?
what's going on , moncho?
this louse is looking for trouble .
you runt !
don't talk like that !
i'll talk the way i want to .
that'll teach you some manners .
blind , shit !
you can see now .
that's enough !
in you go !
moncho , lead the way !
leave her .
you stay here .
would you mind telling me what i did to deserve your insults?
i've had a gutful of this .
if you want to stay you'll have to exercise a little self control , and be a bit more humble to everybody .
if that's the way , it's better to leave .
give me something to go on with .
because i'm poor , without it ...
are you tired?
i nearly walked my legs off today .
that has done me good .
why don't you let me do that , miss?
because i've got him into bad habits .
you can take the basin .
whenever you're ready i can serve supper .
right , we'll have it now .
what's the matter with you?
nothing .
why the bad temper?
it's viridiana .
she's getting on my nerves .
she's mad .
no , she's rotten with religion .
let her do what she wants .
she doesn't bother us in any way .
do you know what i think?
what's annoying you is that she pays so little attention to you .
that's the last straw !
look what you've done !
so , ramona !
run and get something to mop it up with , quickly .
that woman's getting more and more stupid every day .
oh well .
i'm feeling good again ...
the tomatoes !
pass me the bread .
catch !
when i wasn't so miserable i used to sell pigs .
i was more honest than my holy mother .
so you didn't come from the poorhouse?
say that again !
he has the devil in him .
you know what don zequiel told me yesterday?
when it itches , how does he manage to scratch when he can't see?
tell him his mother comes to scratch me .
eat and shut up !
damned poca !
but i love you , amalio .
good evening !
good evening , miss !
benedictus !
come in , come in ...
you sit there .
and you there .
these are your new companions .
you must be hungry ...
god will reward you .
have you eaten well?
i don't want to criticize the saintly miss who is so good to us , but i would take the liberty of saying that the beans were acid .
what does that mean?
sour , idiot .
don't pay any attention to them , they're peasants .
if don zequiel says the beans were bad it must be true .
we'll do something about it tomorrow .
now i've got some good news for you .
tomorrow , you can all get to work !
don't worry .
you won't need to do anything you don't want to .
i only want you to have a bit of a change and to take some exercise .
miss !
i'm a cook .
i'm good at roasts and vanilla puddings .
last year i made pastry for the companza people .
good .
they can still remember it .
perfect !
you can help me with the accounts .
i can paint religious pictures .
before , i used to be able to write , but now with this leg i've forgotten .
i can weave hemp , but with the rheumatism in my fingers ...
what about you , manuel?
i'm only good at making people laugh .
that's all right , we all laugh here , but not at you .
i'll see to that .
i've got green fingers .
the priest will tell you .
so you won't get bored here , there'll be more than enough for you to do !
look !
it's disgusting .
let's see it .
that's leprosy .
throw him out , miss !
he has to leave .
let me see .
they're varicose veins , miss , but some days i can't take care of them .
are you sure it isn't contagious?
they told me it isn't at the hospital .
don't listen to him , miss .
i've known him for a long time .
they're varicose veins .
it isn't leprosy .
i'll take him to the doctor tomorrow .
it's benign .
and you , look after him as if he were a sick brother .
be understanding .
now finish eating and then go to bed .
everyone in bed by eight o'clock !
you'll show the newcomers the dormitory .
good night everyone .
good night , miss .
if you don't disappear , i'll make holes in your belly .
you're not the one to make me move .
the miss , she understands , she told me i could stay .
hit him if he doesn't get out !
calm down , people , calm down .
if anything happens , we'll all be thrown out .
out , the turd !
okay , that's it .
i give in , but i'm staying on the grounds .
give me something for tomorrow morning .
i'll come to you tonight .
no , the children sleep with me .
give them to refugio .
no , i don't want to because they yell .
and there's a new one .
then i'll get you in the fields tomorrow ...
pass me the salt .
who's there?
jorge .
you frightened me .
it's about time we spoke to each other , isn't it?
well ... is it so urgent?
yes .
now that i have the chance .
when you're not with your poor people , you're praying or you disappear .
i never see you .
what's the matter?
i want to put in some electricity .
the electricity poles are installed , yet we're living in the middle ages !
i want to make some improvements .
then there's the land .
it really hurts me to think of it not producing anything .
i don't know anything about these things .
but what's your opinion .
do what you think is best .
is that everything?
no it isn't , there's much more .
it seems absurd to be living under the same roof without knowing each other .
what do you know about me?
i know that you used to work with an architect .
and do you know that i lived with my mother?
tell me !
if my father had cared a little more about us , i'd be an architect now .
i don't understand how you can like being alone so much .
i'm not like you , you have your wife .
we're not married .
i don't need anybody's blessing to live with a woman .
i see that you ...
i ought to go .
good night .
the next time you come , knock first and wait until i tell you to come in .
i'll put some yellow in her face to show she is ill .
hurry up , i'm cramped all over .
it's nearly finished , sweetheart .
i don't like having to stay still for so long .
it seems to me that you ought to know damn well how to swing your ...
she looks like a pumpkin !
don't pay any attention to him .
it's very good .
i don't like having to be the virgin .
you ought to be the one in bed .
i'd like to ask you , miss , to pose ...
me?
just so the virgin can be really pretty .
it won't take but a minute .
this votive offering is dedicated to the virgin of the helpless .
do you have great devotion for the virgin?
i'm not a bigot , miss , but everybody has his own beliefs ... and then ... with this terrible thing ... if i didn't have faith ...
did you sleep well , miss?
yes .
may the lord watch over us ...
i must know when you expect to give birth .
why?
heavens !
so the doctor can be warned .
in that case in about four months , but i can't tell you exactly .
she doesn't even know who the father was .
she said that it was night and she couldn't even see his face .
the whole town doesn't need to know .
shut up .
you shouldn't speak like that in front of our holy protector , who is a well bred person .
i'm very sorry for you .
have you any other children?
no , miss , it will be the first .
we're going to the village .
with god's and your own permission .
they must bring me some potatoes , bacon and rice .
take it and be careful not to be as late as you were yesterday .
could they bring me some tobacco?
smoking makes him spit and feel ill .
it's these filthy fag ends .
i won't mention in this company what's upsetting you .
bring the tobacco and i'll distribute it .
thank you , miss .
come over here and see the picture .
come on !
it's very good .
thank you , but it's missing something .
that doesn't matter .
i like it .
how much is that?
fifteen yards .
that's fifteen by seven?
good .
thanks pal , see you later .
goodbye , if you ever need anything ...
that animal can't take any more .
now that the wagon's empty , why don't you let him ride?
it's for people !
then let him go and he'll follow you .
and let him get run over by somebody else?
i'll buy him .
he's good at rabbiting and he knows it .
if he doesn't hunt , he doesn't get fed .
how much do you want for him?
if you want ...
i'll leave it to you .
all right , untie him .
thank you , and my god bless you .
get moving .
and remember , the less he eats , the better he runs .
what's he called?
canelo !
where are you going?
come here , canelo !
come on !
let's go , don't be afraid .
have you thought of what you want planted yet?
the fields have been left so long , with a good manuring anything will grow .
it's land for wheat .
and for maize sometimes .
and the orchards?
that's good land .
what a miracle , you let yourself be seen .
have you come to look at the work?
i've told you before i'm not interested in this .
the best thing my father left me was the land .
you can see the result of the work on it .
and if you helped me it wouldn't take long to change it even more .
what are you doing here?
get out .
leave him alone .
you won't get much done with those people .
those times are over !
you ought to let me kick them out .
do they worry you that much , then?
they worry me a great deal .
especially because of you .
there's no point in helping some of them when there are so many others .
i know perfectly well how little i can do .
what i want to do is give passing beggars a roof , some food and a bit of human warmth .
is that all you're going to devote your life to?
i'm not sure yet .
i've had a shock recently , and i'm only beginning to get over it .
perhaps i'll go back to the convent one day .
get out of here !
swine !
why are they shouting at him?
have they no pity?
i don't know what's going on .
ask him .
these rascals are demons .
they've tied a can to him .
so they know when he's coming .
i told you where to go until you're cured .
the weather is wonderful , so i keep on walking and walking .
how are you today?
things seem to be getting better .
hold your arm out .
you can't hope to be cured quickly .
you heard what the doctor said .
but with the help of god , we'll pull through .
it all started one unlucky day .
a punishment from god because one windy day i was with a woman .
you're the first good woman i've seen .
are your parents alive?
parents?
nobody cares a damn , what's the use of them !
don't say that .
it's the truth .
don't pay any attention , this man is no good .
he wants you to catch it too .
at church , he puts his arm into the holy water and says
may all those damn women get it !
the priest won't let him in .
just you wait , liar !
stop this !
he's lying !
ask the priest .
go join the others , and don't come back here .
and you'll have to control your temper .
this must have been my grandfather's .
wake me up tomorrow morning .
what are you going to do?
what i do every day , but i want to start earlier .
nice knife !
good lord !
you're happy , aren't you?
shouldn't i be?
you , on the other hand ...
i'm bored .
i'm alone all day and i don't know what to do .
you should have enough to do in this house .
come here and listen to this .
what are you thinking about?
that your cousin is more to your taste .
she isn't my cousin .
it doesn't make any difference what she is .
you like her .
i had a feeling i shouldn't have come here .
i'd better get out , fast .
we ought to talk about that some other time .
how in hell does it wind up?
i think i'd better go tomorrow .
don't be a fool !
why rush away from something which couldn't happen?
you see how much you like her?
that's life .
some people are brought together , others are separated .
what can we do , if that's the way it happens?
don't cry , lucia .
come on , darling .
what a thing !
where did father find that?
hold on , ramon !
is there time to make another trip?
no sir , it's nearly six o'clock .
okay , let's get a move on !
when are you leaving?
tonight , but i'll be back tomorrow afternoon .
the angelus !
the angel of the lord declared to mary .
and she conceived by the holy ghost .
hail mary , full of grace ...
holy mary , mother of god , pray for us sinners ...
behold the handmaid of the lord .
be it done unto me according to thy word .
and the word was made flesh .
and dwelt among us .
the lord is with thee .
blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb jesus .
pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death .
pray for us , o holy mother of god .
that we may be made worthy of the promises of christ .
amen .
good bye , sir .
good bye .
see you tomorrow .
are they going to work here too?
don't worry .
nobody's going to disturb you .
don't forget the meeting with the lawyer .
the car will pick you up tomorrow morning .
i'll be ready .
do you intend to stay here for some time?
yes .
why?
you can come and live again in the big house .
now that i'm alone , i can settle down anywhere .
and your friend?
she's left .
is she coming back?
no .
why?
why does any man leave a woman?
if you don't understand , i don't want to explain it to you .
you're too cold and religious , you'd be shocked .
miss ...
you have decided to leave , moncho .
yes !
i can't do anything to make you stay?
these people annoy you , isn't that it?
well , what are you going to do?
he's coming to live with me .
if that's what you want ...
but i'm very sorry you're leaving .
thank you for everything , moncho .
god bless you .
obviously !
here's the missing furniture .
what a state it's in !
father must have been a peculiar type .
i don't think the master ever came here .
and this chest?
just some old curtains and drapes .
there must be some rat's nest in there .
tell me .
you worked for my father for seven years , didn't you?
did he ever mention me?
i can't remember .
but i'm sure he loved you .
why?
you wouldn't be here otherwise .
these chairs are in good condition .
with a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable .
what are these sacks doing here?
i don't know .
they've always been there .
that's stupid !
plaster !
it can still be used .
and those?
that's sand .
as i won't be here tomorrow , tell the foreman to take them .
what's wrong with you , woman?
why are you looking at me like that?
do you know something , ramona?
if you took some trouble , you'd be quite pretty .
small teeth , nice lips .
what more do you want?
let's sit down a moment .
are we leaving?
don jorge said he'd be waiting for you at the lawyer's at four o'clock .
good .
you're the most responsible here .
i'm handing them over to you .
don't worry , i'll look after things .
do you want anything else?
bring me a flute if you see one .
i'd like to learn music .
they're going to hurt me .
well if they hurt you , put up with it !
let's go !
good luck , miss !
thank you !
get in !
keep quiet .
these miserable brats only get in the way .
you'd like me to kill them?
with the life that's ahead of them ... they'd be better off being sent to paradise .
put her in the sun with her sister .
they're gone .
now to knock off a couple of lambs .
we'll have them roasted .
what do you think of that?
i'll go along with it ... if it's being respectful enough .
what will the lady say?
she won't even know .
if everybody agrees .
but to make a roast takes four hours .
well , what's all the hurry?
didn't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding?
yes .
get the eggs and milk .
i'll see to the lambs .
don't kill yourself , refugio !
can't you see we're alone?
so?
what's the good of working?
you keep quiet .
stick to your singing !
the miss left me in charge here and nobody is going to upset things .
because of you ...
what made you think that i was up to something?
don zequiel !
refugio !
come here !
damn women !
how did you get in there?
through a back window .
where are you going?
come here , there're wonderful things inside .
if it's only to have a look ...
but don't touch anything .
little dove from the south , you're hurt .
what are you called?
my little dove .
my dear dove .
my darling , sweet dove .
hey , you there !
get out !
or i'll bust your head in !
get lost !
you bastards !
i hope you get what i've got !
that woman , the one who looks like our miss viridiana , she's the wife of the man who hanged himself .
think of hanging yourself , with all that money !
he must have had asthma .
all those loaded old men have asthma .
what stuff !
jesus , mary , and joseph .
how's that for a tablecloth !
come on , let's put it out .
that must have cost a fortune .
at least a thousand .
a thousand !
more like ten thousand !
can't you see it's french lace?
fold it up , you're going to spoil it .
we're not doing any harm .
it's not as bad as smoking his tobacco .
don zequiel's right .
if those people come back and we don't hear them ...
they won't get back before tomorrow .
i heard them tell the driver .
if you haven't eaten on lace like that , you haven't lived .
watch it , don zequiel !
don't worry .
we'll all clean it up .
pass me that bottle .
go on , don amalio !
it's a real hen house here !
you can't hear yourself speak .
tell me the answer to this !
what bird lays eggs in a barn?
shut up , let's hear don amalio !
tell us , don amalio ...
quiet !
we gathered together to beg under the porches .
but only in the churches of the rich !
the girls passing by ... smelled so sweet that you felt them on you .
you can smell them but you can't lay your hands on them !
why did you split up?
you , shut your face !
i won't have questions from any one !
go on with the story !
okay , it broke up when this deaf fellow started on the collection boxes with a knife .
how did you know?
the noise of the money in his pocket gave him away .
we hardly got a sou that day .
you know what i did?
i told the police about him !
you sang because he didn't cut you in , you rat !
the judges thanked me very much .
one of them said i was ...
what?
shitty bastard , that's what i'd call you !
he said " honest citizen " , if you want to know .
to your health !
and to lovely company !
you filthy little brat .
shut up or watch out !
what's up with you?
why are you screaming?
don't you touch my little girl .
keep the brat quiet so we can hear what's going on .
i'll bust your face .
keep your hands off me , you filthy whore !
yes , leave her .
stop this !
let me go , don amalio , i'll tear her apart .
keep quiet .
she's not worth paying attention to .
let's behave ourselves nicely .
stick to your place .
my pudding !
leave it , you thief !
i'll remember this !
you'll see !
don't touch me !
enedina ...
yes?
enedina's going to take a picture .
so we'll have a souvenir .
where's the camera?
it's a present from my parents .
everyone to the other side !
stay quiet .
when i say " smile " , stop moving .
come on , quickly !
refugio , get your hair out of your face !
solve my riddle !
what bird lays eggs in a barn?
the chicken !
nobody move .
the lousy man .
tables aren't meant to lie on .
eat your pudding .
it's a dream .
you have good taste , enedina .
this isn't enedina .
little dove of the south ...
little dove ....
enedina , come here .
come on , drink up !
look at this , enedina .
over here .
what is it?
come .
get down , you won't see it otherwise .
just look at this !
isn't it awful !
let me go !
leave them alone .
it'll make them sorrier later .
that's just the thing for you !
don amalio .
what?
enedina and paco .
what about them?
they're playing games behind the couch .
which couch?
that one .
take me there .
guide me !
where are you , you swine?
take me to them and i'll kill him .
now he has spoiled the party .
holy virgin , how can we clean up this mess?
things are going to be worse than the cuban war .
we'll be better off if we're seen in the village tonight .
if he were my man , he'd have his rights .
but as it is , why?
you're quite right , old dear .
now it's every man for himself .
let's go .
good night .
he doesn't feel too well .
good night , don jorge .
we're leaving now .
they told us you'd be back tomorrow .
i didn't want to do it , don jorge .
they made me .
get out of here !
blessed are the generous , who take into their respectable house a poor defenseless blind man .
god will reward them .
didn't you hear me?
beat it .
okay , get out .
your lordship must not get annoyed ,
i have not done anything wrong .
i got him , comrade .
i got him !
my god , what have you done to him !
he was asking for it .
but why?
why?
jorge .
you shouldn't cry over that .
if you're without one man you can always find another to console you .
leave me alone !
jose !
for the love of god , don't let him ...
nothing will happen to you , miss .
we're all good folk here .
to the village !
we've got to warn the police .
they'll get them in no time .
get in , rita .
why all the fuss?
it had to happen sooner or later !
help !
come here !
maybe afterwards he'll let me ...
come here !
if you help me , you'll be a rich man .
me , rich?
come on !
there's plenty of money in this house .
where?
if i don't keep my word , you can kill me .
i don't want you to untie me .
kill him and then i'll give you the money .
where's the dough?
kill him and i'll tell you .
there are thousands of pesetas ...
kill him , idiot !
that will teach you , you son of a bitch .
where's the cash?
there in the cupboard .
it's open .
on the top shelf .
under the linen .
up there .
let's go !
i want a switch here .
and put a plug over there .
have you got over the scare you had yesterday?
you can put the other plug there at the bottom .
the towel .
who's there?
where are you going?
wait !
come in !
viridiana !
has something happened?
did you want to speak to me?
is there anything i can do?
come in !
i must say , i was not expecting you .
we are playing cards ...
i hope you are not surprised by this pastime .
we must get through the long evenings .
do sit down !
don't leave , ramona !
mademoiselle is not proud and she doesn't mind your staying here .
you know how to play cards , cousin?
no?
then sit down .
i'm sure you'll like it .
you too , sit down .
all cats are gray at night .
do you like this music?
it's popular now .
cut !
like that .
my cousin viridiana will end up playing cards with me .
