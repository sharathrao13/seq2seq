i love you with all o 'my heart !
if i don't see you again a soon , i'm a gonna die !
come over here , kid .
learn somethin '.
you might have to cook for 20 guys someday .
you see?
you start out with a little bit of oil .
then you fry some garlic .
then you throw in some tomatoes , some tomato paste .
you fry it .
you make sure it doesn't stick .
when you got it to a boil , shove in all your sausage and meatballs .
and a little bit of wine .
and a little bit of sugar .
and that's my trick .
why don't you cut the crap?
i got more important things for you to do .
how's paulie?
won't see him no more .
where you going?
to the city .
send some bodyguards with him .
i'm just going to see pop .

he'll be all right .
sollozzo knows he's a civilian .
all right .
be careful , huh?
yes , sir .
send somebody with him anyway .
i have to go .
can i go with you?
no , kay .
there's gonna be detectives there .
people from the press .
i'll ride in a cab .
i don't want you to get involved .
when will i see you again?
go back to new hampshire ... and i'll call you at your parents 'house .
when will i see you again , michael?
i don't know .
what are you doing here?
you're not supposed to be here now .
i'm michael corleone .
this is my father .
there's nobody here .
what happened to the guards?
your father just had too many visitors .
they interfered with hospital service .
the police made them leave about ten minutes ago .
get me long beach 4 5 6 2 0 , please .
nurse , wait a minute .
stay here .
sonny , michael .
i'm at the hospital .
listen .
i got here late .
there's nobody here .
nobody .
no tessio's men , no detectives , nobody .
pop is all alone .
don't panic .
we'll send somebody .
i won't panic .
i'm sorry , but you will have to leave .
you and i are gonna move my father to another room .
can you disconnect those tubes so we can move the bed out?
that's out of the question .
do you know my father?
men are coming here to kill him .
you understand?
now , help me , please .
who are you?
i am enzo the baker .
you remember me?
enzo?
yes , enzo .
you better get out of here , enzo .
there's gonna be trouble .
if there is trouble , i stay here to help you
for your father .
all right , listen .
wait for me outside , in front of the hospital .
all right?
i'll be out in a minute .
go ahead .
just lie here , pop .
i'll take care of you now .
i'm with you now .
i'm with you .
get rid of these .
come here .
put your hand in your pocket like you have a gun .
you'll be all right .
you'll be okay .
you did good .
here he is .
all right , hold still .
i thought i got all you guinea hoods locked up .
what are you doing here?
what happened to the men who were guarding my father , captain?
why , you little punk .
what the hell are you doing , telling me my business?
i pulled them guys off of here .
you get out of here and stay away from this hospital .
i'm not moving until you put some guards around my father's room .
phil , take him in .
the kid's clean , captain .
he's a war hero .
he's never been busted  goddamn it , i said take him in .
what's the turk paying you to set up my father , captain?
take ahold of him .
stand him up .
stand him up straight .
i'm the attorney for the corleone family .
these men are private detectives hired to protect vito corleone .
they're licensed to carry firearms .
if you interfere , you'll have to appear before a judge ... in the morning and show cause .
all right , let him go .
come on .
what's with all the new faces?
gonna need 'em now .
after the hospital thing , sonny got mad .
we hit bruno tattaglia at 4 : 00 this morning .
jesus christ .
looks like a fortress around here .
a hundred button men on the street , 24 hours a day .
that turk shows one hair on his ass , he's dead .
believe me .
hey , michael , come here .
let me look at you .
you look beautiful .
just beautiful .
you're gorgeous .
hey , listen to this .
the turk , he wants to talk .
imagine the nerve on this son of a bitch .
craps out last night , he wants a meeting today .
what'd he say?
what did he say?
he wants us to send michael to hear the proposition .
and the promise is that the deal is so good that we can't refuse .
what about bruno tattaglia?
that's part of the deal .
bruno cancels out what they did to my father .
sonny , we ought to hear what they have to say .
no more .
not this time , consigliere .
no more meetings , no discussions , no more sollozzo tricks .
you give them one message i want sollozzo .
if not , it's all out war .
we go to the mattresses .
some of the other families won't sit still for a war .
then they hand me sollozzo .
your father wouldn't like this .
this is business , not personal .
they shot my father .
even shooting your father was business , not personal , sonny .
well , then business will have to suffer .
and do me a favor , tom
no more advice on how to patch things up .
just help me win , please .
all right?
i found out about this mccluskey who broke mike's jaw .
what about him?
he's definitely on sollozzo's payroll , and for big money .
mccluskey has agreed to be the turk's bodyguard .
what you have to understand , sonny ... is that while sollozzo's being guarded like this ... he is invulnerable .
nobody has ever gunned down a new york police captain .
never .
it would be disastrous .
all the five families would come after you .
the corleone family would be outcast .
even the old man's political protection would run for cover .
so do me a favor .
take this into consideration .
all right , we'll wait .
we can't wait .
can't wait .
i don't care what sollozzo says about a deal .
he's gonna kill pop .
that's it .
that's the key for him .
got to get sollozzo .
mike is right .
let me ask you something first .
what about this mccluskey?
what do we do with this cop?
they want to have a meeting with me , right?
it will be me ...
mccluskey and sollozzo .
let's set the meeting .
get our informers to find out where it's going to be held .
we insist it's a public place a bar , a restaurant .
someplace where there's people , so i feel safe .
they're gonna search me when i first meet them , right?
so i can't have a weapon on me then .
but if clemenza can figure a way ... to have a weapon planted there for me ...
then i'll kill them both .
what are you gonna do?
nice college boy , huh?
didn't want to get mixed up in the family business .
now you want to gun down a police captain?
why?
'cause he slapped you in the face a little bit?
do you think this is the army , where you shoot them a mile away?
you gotta get up close , like this and
you blow their brains all over your nice ivy league suit .
come here .
you're taking this very personal .
tom , this is business , and this man is taking it very , very personal .
where does it say you can't kill a cop?
come on , mikey .
tom , wait a minute .
i'm talking about a cop that's mixed up in drugs .
i'm talking about a dishonest cop , a crooked cop ... who got mixed up in the rackets and got what was coming to him .
that's a terrific story .
we have newspaper people on the payroll , don't we , tom?
they might like a story like that .
they might .
they just might .
it's not personal , sonny .
it's strictly business .
it's as cold as they come .
impossible to trace , so you don't worry about prints , mike .
i put a special tape on the trigger and the butt .
here .
try it .
what's the matter , the trigger too tight?
my ears .
i left it noisy .
that way it scares pain in the ass innocent bystanders away .
all right , you shot them both .
now what do you do?
sit down , finish my dinner .
come on , kid .
don't fool around .
just let your hand drop to your side and let the gun slip out .
everybody will still think you got it .
they're gonna be staring at your face , mike ... so walk out of the place real fast , but you don't run .
don't look nobody directly in the eye , but don't look away , either .
they're gonna be scared stiff of you , believe me ... so don't worry about nothing .
you know , you're gonna turn out all right .
you take a long vacation , nobody knows where ... and we're gonna catch the hell .
how bad do you think it's gonna be?
pretty goddamn bad .
probably all the other families will line up against us .
that's all right .
these things gotta happen every five years or so .
ten years .
helps to get rid of the bad blood .
been ten years since the last one .
you gotta stop them at the beginning ...
like they should have stopped hitler at munich .
they should have never let him get away with that .
they was just asking for big trouble .
you know , mike , we was all proud of you ... being a hero and all .
your father too .
nothing .
not a hint .
absolutely nothing .
even sollozzo's people don't know where the meeting will be held .
how much time do we have?
gonna pick you up in front of jack dempsey's joint ... in an hour and a half exactly an hour and a half .
we could put a tail on them , see how it turns out .
sollozzo'll lose our ass going around the block .
what about the negotiator?
he's over at my place playing pinochle with a couple of my men .
he's happy .
they're letting him win .
it's too much of a risk for mike .
maybe we ought to call it off .
the negotiator keeps playing cards until mike's back safe and sound .
why doesn't he blast who's ever in the goddamn car?
too dangerous .
they'll be looking for that .
sollozzo might not even be in the car , sonny .
i got it .
yeah .
louis restaurant in the bronx .
is it reliable?
that's my man in mccluskey's precinct .
a police captain's got to be on call 24 hours a day .
he signed out at that number between 8 : 00 and 1 0 : 00 .
anybody know this joint?
yeah , sure .
i do .
it's perfect for us .
a small family place , good food .
everyone minds his business .
it's perfect .
pete , they got an old fashioned toilet
you know , the box and the chain thing .
we might be able to tape the gun behind it .
all right .
mike , you go to the restaurant .
you eat , you talk for a while , you relax .
you make them relax .
then you get up and go take a leak .
no , better still , you ask for permission to go .
and when you come back , you come out blasting .
and don't take any chances .
two shots in the head apiece .
now , listen .
i want somebody good and i mean very good to plant that gun .
i don't want him coming out with just his dick in his hands .
the gun will be there .
all right , listen .
you drive him and you pick him up after the job .
come on .
let's move .
thank you , tom .
did he tell you to drop the gun right away?
yeah , a million times .
don't forget two shots apiece in the head ... as soon as you come out the door .
let's go .
how long do you think it'll be before i can come back?
at least a year , mike .
listen , i'll square with mom you not seeing her before you leave ... and i'll get a message to that girlfriend ... when i think the time is right .
take care .
see you , mike .
okay , tom .
i'm glad you came , mike .
i hope we can straighten everything out .
this is terrible .
it's not the way i wanted things to go at all .
it should have never happened .
i want to straighten everything out tonight .
i don't want my father bothered anymore .
he won't be , mike .
i swear on my children he won't be .
but you got to keep an open mind when we talk .
i hope you're not a hothead like your brother sonny .
you can't talk business with him .
he's a good kid .
i'm sorry about the other night , mike .
i gotta frisk you , so turn around , huh?
on your knees , facing me .
i guess i'm getting too old for my job .
too grouchy .
can't stand the aggravation .
you know how it is .
he's clean .
we're going to jersey?
maybe .
nice work , lou .
how's the italian food in this restaurant?
good .
try the veal .
it's the best in the city .
i'll have it .
i'm gonna speak italian to mike .
go ahead .
what i want what's most important to me is that i have a guarantee : no more attempts on my father's life .
what guarantees could i give you?
i am the hunted one .
i missed my chance .
you think too much of me , kid .
i'm not that clever .
all i want is a truce .
i have to go to the bathroom .
is that all right?
you gotta go , you gotta go .
i frisked him .
he's clean .
don't take too long .
i've frisked a thousand young punks .
hey , come on .
come on .
let's go .
joe , you take over .
hi , grandpa .
i love you , grandpa .
i'm sorry , pa .
he doesn't know you yet .
here you are , big guy .
give it to grandpa .
i hope you get well , grandpa ... and i wish i would see you soon .
love , your grandson , frank .
go with your mother .
go ahead .
take 'em downstairs .
go on , carlo .
you too .
go on .
i got chicken cacciatore for you , sweetheart .
that's enough bread .
i love bread .
but how much can you eat?
what's the matter with you , carlo?
shut up and set the table .
since mccluskey's killing ... the police have been cracking down on most of our operations .
and also the other families '.
been a lot of bad blood .
they hit us , so we hit them back .
through our contacts in the newspapers ... we've been able to put out a lot of material ... about mccluskey being linked with sollozzo in the drug rackets .
see , things are starting to loosen up .
dad , i'm sending fredo to las vegas ... under the protection of don francesco of l. a.
i want him to rest .
i'm going to learn the casino business .
yeah .
where is michael?
it was michael who killed sollozzo .
but he's safe .
we're starting to work to bring him back now .
i want you to find out where that little pimp tattaglia is hiding .
i want his ass now right now .
hey , sonny .
what?
things are starting to loosen up a little bit .
if you go after tattaglia , all hell's going to break loose .
let the smoke clear .
pop can negotiate .
no , pop can't do nothing till he's better .
i'm gonna decide
all right , but your war's costing us a lot of money .
nothing's coming in .
we can't do business .
neither can they .
don't worry about it .
we can't afford a stalemate .
then there ain't no more stalemate .
i'm gonna end it by killing that old bastard .
you're getting a great reputation .
i hope you're enjoying it .
do what i tell you to do !
goddamn it , if i had a wartime consigliere a sicilian
i wouldn't be in this shape !
pop had genco .
look what i got .
i'm sorry .
i didn't mean that .
mom made a little dinner .
it's sunday .
niggers are having a good time ... with our policy banks up there in harlem .
driving them new cadillacs , paying 50 % on a bet .
i knew that was gonna happen as soon as they started making big money .
papa never talked business at the table in front of the kids .
shut up , connie .
don't you ever tell her to shut up .
you got that?
santino , don't interfere .
sonny , tom , i'd like to talk to you , maybe after dinner .
i could be doing more for the family .
we don't discuss business at the table .
corleone .
hey , american !
take me to america !
g. i. !
take me to america , g. i. clark gable .
i apologize if i offended you .
i'm a stranger in this country ... and i meant no disrespect to you or your daughter .
i'm an american hiding in sicily .
my name is michael corleone .
there are people who would pay a lot of money for that information .
but then your daughter would lose a father ... instead of gaining a husband .
i want to meet your daughter ... with your permission ... and under the supervision of your family ... with all respect .
apollonia .
hey !
i'm gonna knock you dizzy .
save it for the library .
come on .
we gotta go pick up my sister .
let's go .
what's the matter?
it was my fault !

sonny , please .
it was my fault .
i hit him .
i started a fight with him .
please , sonny .
i'm sorry .
i'm just gonna get a doctor to come and take a look at you .
sonny , please don't do anything .
what's the matter with you?
what am i gonna do?
am i gonna make that baby an orphan before he's born?
all right?

tell him to stop taking action , all right?
you lost enough money last weekend to me .
carlo , come here .

weren't expecting you .
you should call .
yes , well , i have .
i've tried writing and calling .
now , i wanna reach michael .
nobody knows where he is .
we know he's all right , but that's all .
what was that?
that's an accident .
but nobody was hurt .
would you give this letter to michael , please?
well , if i accepted that ... in a court of law they could prove i have knowledge of his whereabouts .
just be patient .
he'll get in touch with you .
i let my cab go .
can i come in to call another one?
come on .
i'm sorry .
come on .
