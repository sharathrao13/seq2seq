let's just ...
let's just think outside of the box here .
look , she'll get a job , i'll keep mowing ... ... lawns , and over time we'll pay it down .
you know?
this can work .
we can do this .
it'll be like a payment plan .
you really care about her , huh?
yeah , i really do .
yeah , i don't know .
if i'm gonna do this payment plan thing ... ... i need a show of good faith , you know?
something concrete .
well , like what?
a blowjob .
no .
i told you she's not gonna do that anymore .
who said anything about her?
yeah , we're definitely outside the box now , huh?
now , you gotta ask yourself , how far are you willing to go?
how much do you really care about her?
i'm joking , man .
relax .
damn .
do i look gay to you?
no , but , jesus ...
you wanna be president?
always know if the juice is worth the squeeze .
you know what that means?
it means you don't steal my girl ... ... unless you're ready to accept the consequences .
all right , i'm sorry , okay?
that's gonna swell up like a bitch .
here , take this .
i'm telling you , it's gonna hurt like shit .
i'm sorry i got upset .
i felt taken advantage of .
look , i'm not gonna be a dick .
i know she loves you .
i'm gonna leave you guys alone .
but now you're doing something for me .
remember that ass bag , hugo , from the convention?
we used to be partners a long time ago .
one day , i had this killer idea to make films set ... ... in real life situations .
you know , real world porn .
i told the idea to hugo .
he says he'll think about it .
and what does that motherfucker do?
takes my best girl , starts his own company with my idea ... ... and the guy makes millions .
it's not the money that pisses me off .
i mean , fuck , it does piss me off ... ... but that's not it .
it's the perception .
everybody thinks hugo's the genius .
it was my idea .
it's like he's simon , and i'm garfunkel .
look at me , man .
i'm fucking garfunkel .
look , seriously , i can't do this .
don't be a pussy .
nobody's home .
why do you want this thing so bad?
because it should've been mine .
i'll grab it and leave .
you don't understand ... ... i have to be at a dinner in an hour .
my whole life depends on it .
you want me out of danielle's life?
yes , i do .
then let's go .
but wait , seriously .
sometimes , if you wanna do something good ... ... you gotta do something bad .
yeah , but this is breaking and entering .
this is politics .
hey .
after this , we're cool , okay?
you're all right , man .
yes .
i'd like to report a robbery .
avn best plcture 1999 " chltty chltty gang bang

matthew kidman?
my competition .
hey , what's up , ryan?
jesus , what happened to you?
just living life , my man .
mina , how are you?
okay .
just a little nervous .
but you're a little temptress , though , aren't you?
hey , buddy .
how you doing?
hey .
thanks a lot , thanks a lot .
hey , there's the big daddy .
matthew , what has been going on with you?
some serious shit .
but , jesus , man , it's good to see you .
will you excuse us , please?
oh , my god .
am i blowing it?
just try and control yourself .
just breathe , okay?
all right .
i have learned a lot from my teachers .
but my best teacher has always been my mother ... ... a woman who worked three jobs trying to support me ... ... ever since i was a little nia .
and that is why i have always tried to answer the call ... ... of the great john f. kennedy ... ... who urged us to " ask not what your country " ...
let's see here ...
i can't speak a foreign language ... ... so that's out .
and i ...
i certainly can't quote j. f. k. now ... ... can i , ryan?
you know what?
it's funny , i have this whole speech prepared ... ... and i've been practicing for weeks ... ... but you know what?
i'm just gonna go with it .
moral fiber .
so , what is moral fiber?
i mean ...
it's funny , i used to think it was always telling the truth ... ... doing good deeds .
you know , basically being a fucking boy scout .
but lately , i've been seeing it differently .
now i think that moral fiber's about ... ... finding that one thing you really care about .
that one special thing that means more ... ... to you than anything else in the world .
and when you find her ... ... you fight for her .
you risk it all .
you put her in front of everything ... ... all of it .
and maybe the stuff you do to help her isn't so clean .
you know what?
it doesn't matter .
because in your heart you know ... ... that the juice is worth the squeeze .
that's what moral fiber's all about .
first , i'd just like to commend the candidates on ... ... their impressive remarks .
this year was a very tough decision .
and as much as we'd love to give you all scholarships , we can't .
ryan winger .
oh , god , what happened?
yeah , i slipped .
listen , jeannie , samnang's coming on monday .

hello .
i'm april .
and i'm ferrari .
you may recognize us as stars of the adult entertainment industry .
and today we're taking time out to talk about ... ... a very important subject .
sex .
sex .
special events such as senior prom ... ... place added pressure on young teens ... ... to lose their virginity and engage in unprotected sex .
i know i lost my virginity at my senior ... ... prom .
when'd you lose yours , april?
when i was 10 .
moving on .
in this video , we'll go through . ... everything from kissing to foreplay .
and for our finale , we'll show you how to put a condom on properly ... ... using a real person .
no cucumbers or bananas in this video .
so for those of you naughty boys ... ... expecting to see a raunchy porn video ... ... you might as well turn this off now ... ... because you're not gonna see sex .
what the fuck is this shit?
you're gonna see sex education .
the eli experlence presents
adult educatlon sex education for the 21st century
this is interesting , matthew .
yeah .
yeah , i think it's a great idea .
well , you remember those sex ed films back in our day .
well , i'll tell you , if they were anything like this ... ... we sure would've paid more attention , don't you think?
i think it's atrocious .
but ... ... the hell with it .
the kids today are so goddamn screwed up ... ... maybe this is the only way you can reach them .
you just might have something here , matthew .
i think it's pretty wild .
this could really sell , don't you think?
how'd you come up with such an idea , matthew?
what can i say?
it's like a gift , you know?
it's like i can't control it .
