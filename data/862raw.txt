right over there , captain .
thank you .
yes .
yes , colonel .
yes , sir .
yes , sir , yes , sir ...
oh , it's you .
what do you want?
one nightshirt .
what do you call this thing?
gown .
one pair of bloomers , two pairs of stockings ...
just a moment .
one slip .
sorry i couldn't get them to you sooner .
goodbye lieutenant gates .
what a stinker you are .
did i forget something?
dirty stinker , get right back in there and explain to them how you got my laundry by mistake and forgot to give it back to me .
it's such a dull story .
who would care?
you know what they think .
i don't understand ...
oh , no ...
you mean you and me?
i'll explain that the idea is revolting .
oh , no you don't .
never mind .
i'd be delighted to explain that i think you're repulsive .
never mind .
forget it .
you've had your joke , now beat it .
i'm here on official business .
don't tell me .
another mission?
don't get your hopes up .
you're not coming with me .
thank heavens .
who is your victim?
my interpreter and aide is lieutenant eloise billings , who i'm reliably informed is intelligent , pretty and , as you americans say , stacked .
that she is .
you haven't met her?
no , that will occur in major prendergast's office in 30 seconds .
goodbye again , lieutenant gates .
where are you going?
major prendergast's office .
there's nothing for you to do there .
wait ...
i'm in a hurry .
hello , eloise .
hi , honey .
capt. rochard , lieutenant billings .
you'll work together .
enchanted .
how do you do ...
we have a mutual friend , alex brissac .
sure , i remember him .
as i was on previous missions with capt. rochard , he just returned some of my things .
perhaps i can help .
i can explain .
don't you have somewhere to go?
no , i'm free until 2 . 30 .
about this mission ...
it's simple .
we have to go to bad nauheim , a pleasant village ...
till you get there .
i can explain better when we're alone .
better wear side arms .
he uses maps instead of etchings .
i've so looked forward to going to bad nauheim .
the french army shoe is slightly different .
hold the foot , junior .
yes , yes .
as shown by the captain's foot and my thigh .
for goodness sake !
that was purely accidental .
the mark on my chin ...
may i have my foot?
thank you .
the mark under my chin was an accident .
my fault entirely .
i tripped while he was chasing me .
will you shut up?
see?
something i'd never have mentioned , his temperament .
but he's not to blame , more like a form of epilepsy .
will you shut up?
i tell you ...
will you sh ...?
henri , i'm talking .
yes , you are .
i tell you because we're members of the same army and the same sex .
it's only fair to warn you that jack the ripper is up that alley .
in case anything happens , would you give me your mother's address?
i've been trying to tell you , i'm not going on this mission .
i'm going to frankfurt with colonel bliven .
but who?
you're going with him .
who is jack the ...?
honey , maybe you better leave me your mother's address .
hello , captain rochard .
i was going to send for you , gates .
come in .
you too , captain .
this shouldn't take long .
gates , billings is needed elsewhere .
you'll go with captain rochard .
thank you , no .
if i may suggest , lieutenant perry has almost finished her assignment ...
no experience .
the captain wants our best , don't you?
well , major , this is not an important mission .
my government request for an officer is only a technicality ...
your orders call for our full co operation , i'll see you get it .
here's your identity card , security pass and ration card .
gates , captain rochard will brief you on the mission .
yes , major .
major , this lieutenant perry , she ought to do .
you're very kind , but we're used to being short handed .
besides , if i remember , you've had assignments with gates before , and very successfully .
recovered art treasures stolen by the nazis from the lille museum " .
located hidden documents relating to rocket research .
received legion of merit ...
she's your man .
wish she were .
pardon?
nothing .
is there anything else?
no , thank you .
you've done more than you realise .
good luck then .
goodbye , major .
jack the ripper was a famous ...
thank you .
thank you , captain .
i wonder what the army would do if i deserted?
they'd shoot you .
the thought makes my mouth water .
i'd almost prefer it myself .
which way do we go?
well , let's get the briefing over .
what's the job?
you don't need to know .
come on , what's the job?
to keep your mouth shut and do as i tell you .
i need to know what equipment to draw from the quartermaster .
see if they have a spare head .
i warn you , bubble mouth , i'll carry a revolver and a trench knife .
if you touch me , you'll go back minus a lot of parts you value .
there you go again , you idiot .
i didn't touch you .
i'm sorry , but we're stuck together .
why not make the best of it?
there is no best .
i'll go crazy if you ...
we turn here .
i'll go crazy if you keep losing your maniac temper .
let's grow up .
i'm sorry about the wine cellar .
i have no temper .
no one ever accused me of that !
they didn't?
do you remember the last time i saw you?
you were chasing me around dsseldorf swearing you'd tear my head off and make me eat it .
and what colour was i?
i was a lovely robin's egg blue .
you looked so funny .
on account of being pushed into a vat of dye by you !
i didn't know , i thought it was water .
water ...
blue , all over , blue .
it's your own fault .
drinking free wine and turning into an octopus ...
you misunderstood .
i was trying to be friendly .
i'm sorry , i misunderstood .
let's forget it , the dye has come off .
no , it hasn't .
it hasn't?
no .
i'm sorry .
that's all right , there's an advantage in being an oddity .
in here , henri .
hello , jack .
hello .
what's so funny?
it's difficult to describe .
captain rumsey , captain rochard of the french economic mission .
je suis enchant de faire votre connaissance .
hiya .
have you some orders for me?
all ready , burns ...
cathy , this means no dance for me saturday night .
don't be silly , take kitty .
i'd rather sit in my room and think of you .
wouldn't you , captain?
alone , in my room .
take good care of her .
i'll watch her every moment .
that's fine .
we better be going .
bye , jack .
how about dinner the night you get back?
it's a deal .
alors , mon capitaine ...
avez ...
avez de bonne chance .
see you in church .
sure .
so long .
so long .
that linguist is stuck on you .
what's the matter with him?
it's only natural that you wouldn't understand .
it certainly is .
you chase after anything in skirts .
they're all the same to you .
but lots of men can tell them apart .
sometimes they find one they like more than the others .
that's called love .
you probably haven't experienced it , but you must've read about it .
where are we going?
i go that way , i have to get my stuff .
where do i go?
i have to pay off my cab .
i'll meet you at the motor pool in twenty minutes .
before you go .
why did you say i run after everything in skirts?
i didn't .
i said anything .
that's different , then .
american women ...
for weeks , you've been talking about the man as if he had jaundice .
he did .
now you're over the moon because you'll be alone with him three days .
you can do a lot in three days .
if you work at it .
what about the dye?
is he still blue?
he's still mad , but he's fun to fight with .
bring that , will you?
sure .
are you ready , captain?
quite ready , lieutenant .
morning , sergeant .
we need transportation to bad nauheim .
sorry , you're all out of luck .
we'll settle for a jeep .
all we've got are motorcycles and side cars .
come on , sergeant .
did you look at your orders?
what about those cars?
you've got priority 4 .
that's bottom .
well , captain , what do we do?
we'll have to take a motorcycle .
are you checked out on motorcycles?
i can drive one .
if you ain't checked out , you can't .
i have a motorcycle licence .
well , i guess that fixes you up .
we'll wait for a car .
i can drive one .
i'm sure .
i'm good on a motorcycle .
my brother had one , we went hill climbing .
i can even ride standing up .
what for?
i can still ride a motorcycle .
or are you afraid?
we'll take it , sergeant .
and i am afraid .
any one of these?
sure , take your pick .
remember , she has to drive .
that's regulations .
thank you .
sergeant , can we have a helmet and goggles?
in the toolbox , lieutenant .
yes .
thanks .
what are you laughing at?
begging your pardon , how do you intend to ride?
side saddle?
no .
begging your pardon , astride .
it's a shame .
excuse me .
how far is it to bad nauheim?
about 120 kilometres .
do you know the way?
i've got a map .
of germany?
yes , captain , of germany .
you'll be all right .
lieutenant !
you forgot something !
never mind , let her go .
sorry , i took it off for oiling and forgot to hook it up .
take this one , it's all in one piece .
it would be better , don't you agree?
i don't know .
you don't?
yes , i don't know .
you know how silly you look sitting there?
is it still so funny?
no , i was just thinking how nice it'd be if this one came off while we were driving .
oh , i dropped my lipstick .
it rolled over there .
get it , will you?
it's a pleasure to get out of this portable bathtub .
i can't reach it .
it's over there .
climb over the top .
let me down !
let me down !
henri , what are you doing up there?
what's the deal?
the area's sealed off from here to battenberg .
what for?
rounding up a gang of black market dealers .
i have a pass .
sorry , it's no good .
i've got a general pass .
keep it .
all passes are suspended .
for how long?
8 to 12 hours , maybe 24 .
i'm sorry .
well?
i might've known .
don't blame me .
it's not my fault .
what'll we do?
i can't wait here .
i've got to be in bad nauheim at 3 pm tomorrow .
if this thing had wings , we could ...
what's wrong with that?
what?
that boat .
it should say u. s. navy on it .
why not put the motorcycle on it and row down past battenberg?
it's not far .
we can pick up the road there .
do you think they'll let us?
we can try .
lieutenant , can we take that boat and row past battenberg?
so long as you don't row on the road , it's none of my business .
can we have some help?
thanks .
sergeant christian !
yes?
bring some men over here .
watch your feet .
put it in gear .
thanks .
lieutenant , tell the o. i. c we'll return the boat or telegraph him where to pick it up .
will you help us to shove off?
thanks .
have a nice trip .
thanks .
grab an oar .
me?
yes , you .
an oar .
pull , pull .
pull .
what's that ahead?
a bridge .
it's not on the map , though .
where are we?
a couple of miles should do it .
what's that noise?
sounds like a c 47 .
it's bigger than that , must be a c 54 .
must be a lot of c 47s .
c 54s !
whatever kind of planes the are , they make a lot of noise .
it doesn't ...
henri , row for shore , quick !
why?
don't argue , row !
let me tell you something .
i'm going straight down this river .
you sure are , but you're going over a waterfall first .
that's different ...
henri , stop playing ostrich !
hold this !
let's try to pull ourselves free !
all right .
come on , pull , pull hard !
i'm pulling !
now we're getting it !
danke !
now row .
i'm rowing .
come on , henri , pull .
row hard .
i am !
now , turn it around .
i'll turn it .
you're so clumsy !
have you got it?
a bit more .
that's awfully wet ground you're sitting on .
at the moment , i can't feel anything , but , when i do , i'm going to kick you bowlegged .
for what?
for saving your life?
oh , yes .
you did catch that rope .
i did .
convenient , wasn't it?
they always are .
i suppose i owe you something .
i'll call it square if you explain the mission .
come on , henri .
there's a man there who grinds lenses .
his name is ...
what's the matter?
charley horse .
roll over , i can fix that .
never mind .
go ahead with the story .
his name's schindler .
a lens grinder .
i have to persuade him that we'll pay more than the black market .
that's sore .
roll over , i'm good at that .
all right .
what's our problem?
no problem .
a few well chosen words , a contract , a passport and then home .
that's the whole plot .
simple , isn't it?
i don't see why they assigned me to this mission .
they didn't want to make it too easy .
how is my leg?
not bad , better than i remembered .
perhaps the other ...
no , never mind .
that'll do .
help me up .
i was just being friendly .
but you're never friendly from a distance .
henri , one move , and it won't be a vat of dye , it'll be the river .
you wouldn't .
yes , i would .
i think you would .
catherine , your lack of co operation is amazing !
i'll co operate by finding out where we are .
who put us on the river?
i knew you'd say that .
you're tiresome .
you're subnormal .
i don't propose to argue any further .
that darn road doesn't come within 10 kilometres of here .
across open country in that thing?
it'll be a little bumpy , but we'll make it by 3 o'clock .
we won't get there before dark , if we get there at all .
this motorcycle will go anywhere , if you help me get it out of the boat .
we'll be on the road in no time .
pitch dark .
we're lost , absolutely lost .
is there a difference?
haven't you got a bump of direction?
it's the only kind i haven't got .
come on , you drive .
my back hurts .
you're the one who checked out on the motorcycle .
stop being so cute .
i hate you when you ...
what's that?
listen .
we must've been driving alongside that road for the last hour .
perhaps they just moved it there .
oh , shut up .
there's a sign back there .
see what it says .
i don't suppose you have a flashlight?
no , i haven't .
what does it say?
i can't see !
well , climb up , silly .
hurry up , it's starting to rain .
what does it say?
i can't tell .
it's in german .
well , move your arm !
you can come down now , henri .
what does it say?
never mind , get in .
what does it say?
" wet paint " .
how many miles ...?
no , henri .
no , no .
you'll get wet .
get in the sidecar .
i know .
hurry up .
all right , we're in bad nauheim .
you can come out .
are you sure?
yes , i'm sure .
and bring my bag .
good evening , come in .
do you have any free rooms for this evening?
of course .
do you want a one or two rooms?
two , please .
what are you talking about?
he wanted to know if we want one room or two .
you told him?
i told him .
come this way .
what's the matter?
my back , i think it's broken .
and it's all your fault .
if you'd got that cow out of the way , we needn't have taken that detour .
it was a bull .
cow .
you said you couldn't tell at 20 yards away .
i know , but it couldn't be a bull , he would've had horns .
who is it?
cinderella .
what do you want?
my slipper .
well , open the door .
what do you want?
you just said that .
how's your back?
awful .
it hurts .
get into bed .
i will not get into bed .
what are you doing?
what's that?
i brought you a drink .
i thought so .
i knew you'd get up to your ...
and some liniment to rub your back .
get into bed .
we'll need some water .
take your shirt off too .
i am not going to take my shirt off .
how am i going to rub your back through it?
you won't rub my back through anything , including my foolishness .
here , drink this .
want some water?
no .
it's good .
my back ...
do you want it rubbed or not?
is that stuff any good?
turn over .
wait a minute .
stop bawling .
i don't want them to think we smuggled in a cow .
it stings .
it's supposed to .
let it soak in for a while .
relax .
you're dislocating everything .
relax .
i hurt further up .
how can you relax if you won't co operate?
i said i hurt further up .
that's better .
makes me feel sleepy .
good .
that's nice , henri .
i'm sorry i thought when you came in you were behaving like a stinker .
you've been a stinker for so long , i just didn't ...
i know .
go to sleep .
with you in the room?
i can't rub you from the hallway .
if i go to sleep , will you promise to leave .
i'll go now .
no ...
feels good .
go to sleep , i'll be gone in a minute .
henri , about this mission ...
never mind .
i just want to ask you a question .
what?
is this mission so important?
it is to me .
it's my last assignment for the army .
i'm getting out next week .
i didn't know that .
then , it is important , isn't it?
henri , i ...
i'm so sleepy ...
good night .
she'll never believe me .
what happened?
what happened?
you unspeakable weasel , i knew you'd be up to your old tricks .
that's ridiculous .
get out .
i said get out .
i can't .
why not?
the door handle came off .
what an excuse .
couldn't you think of a better one?
i don't believe you .
you try to open the door .
all right , i will .
try to open the door .
how did you do that?
you liar , you ...
you're worse than i thought .
put on your shoes and get out .
don't speak to me .
do you understand?
don't speak to me again .
ever !
i don't want to talk to you .
don't speak to me .
stop banging on that door !
you can't come in !
i'm in .
magic .
henri , i told you not to speak to me .
someone's out there .
perhaps they'll let me out .
who is it?
wer ist da?
it's me , the innkeeper's wife .
ein moment .
we must do something .
i know , get out that window .
you can't be found here .
don't argue .
american women ...
but ...
come in .
guten morgen .
morgen , fraulein .
the door handle came off .
it's happened before .
i put it back .
i'm very sorry .
climbing in the nice young lady's room?
raus hier !
raus hier !
henri !
come in .
excuse me , i was looking for captain ...
henri .
no ...
what do you want?
you look like an organ grinder .
excuse me .
sorry .
excuse me .
what was that?
the innkeeper .
i've borrowed his clothes .
why?
i came here to find herr schindler .
i'm going to the black market hangouts to see what i can find out .
if i'm in uniform , no one will tell me anything .
is that reasonable?
see you later .
don't you want any help?
no .
oh , now , henri ...
i'm sorry about the door handle .
you were telling the truth .
nice of you to apologise .
that fixes everything .
what more can i do?
i often wonder .
henri , stop being like that .
you're behaving like a little boy .
i know it .
you said it was important , i just want to help .
never mind .
can i try to find schlindler on my own?
i could do something ...
don't do anything .
you make me so mad , you don't want my help .
don't do anything .
if you see me , don't speak to me , you don't know me .
why not?
you're in uniform .
they'll think i'm a stool pigeon .
can't i go out by myself?
just take orders .
remember , you don't know me .
all right .
you can't speak to me .
okay .
i'm transparent , you can't see me .
i never could , not for sour apples .
you stubborn ...
he makes me so mad , i could ...
catherine .
catherine gates .
jowitt , how are you?
good to see you .
what are you doing here?
i'm on a mission .
i'll tell you about it .
shall we get breakfast?
i know where we can get real coffee .
come on .
will you be here long?
just for a couple of days .
fine .
here we are .
bill trumble , catherine gates .
hello .
how are you?
sit down .
catherine just got in .
guten morgen .
want anything besides coffee?
jam rolls , anything .
make it for two .
jawohl .
how long will you be here?
just a couple of days .
you haven't said why you're here .
it's not much of a story ...
isn't that the fellow you were talking to at the inn?
yes , that's him .
he's going into the wrong place .
that's a black market hangout .
bill has a friend in the mps .
the german police are going to raid that place this morning .
the place he just went into?
that's why we're here for breakfast .
get a floor show for free .
you couldn't have chosen a better spot .
here they are now .
watch them operate .
she can identify me , an officer of the u. s. army .
come here .
catherine , tell these men who i am .
identify me , please .
is something wrong , officer?
lieutenant , he says he's a french officer and you know him .
i never saw him before in my life .
that's what i thought !
you shouldn't have done this .
i'll get even !
i'll get even !
i'll get even , traitor !
i'll get even !
what is going on here?
i'll tell you later .
could you help me find a german lens grinder named schindler?
sure .
we ought to be able to help .
think so?
is this the man?
yes , that's captain rochard .
good morning , henri .
i trust you understand .
there was nothing else we could do .
no identity card ...
it was not really our fault .
don't worry , i'm entirely aware of whose fault it was .
henri , i did exactly as you told me .
thank you , captain .
one question .
why have you no beds here?
didn't you have a bed?
you see , when we had beds , everyone wished to be arrested .
it was terrible .
people did anything , just so they could have a bed .
i know how they felt .
poor dear , you haven't had a wink ...
shut up .
may i go now?
of course .
thank you very much .
i'd like a word with you , outside .
of course , i want to talk to you , too .
i want you to meet this ...
i'll get even , i swear .
even if it takes years , if it takes forever .
go away , i'm busy .
i'll break you ...
like a dry twig , i'll turn you into a shaky old woman ...
i said i was busy . ... with tin cup .
this is the man ...
i understand you can be a rat , but there's one thing that baffles me ...
there's no pleasing some people .
it's your job .
the army gave you an assignment .
you took an oath as an officer , the oath of duty .
i followed your orders .
we'll never find schindler .
where is he now?
he'll have heard i'm looking for him and gone underground .
i know how those fellows work .
what do you want?
who are you? .
schindler .
fine .
will you please stop ...?
you're schindler?
why didn't you say so?
you wouldn't give anyone a chance to say a word .
button your big lip so he can talk .
he hasn't much time before his train .
i just wanted to say i'm so glad , so grateful , so full of happiness .
thank you .
well , goodbye .
wait , i want to talk to you .
he'll miss his train .
i'm going to paris , french economic bureau .
i have my passport , documents and contract .
i took them out of your briefcase .
this wonderful lady gave and told me everything .
so , i leave germany now .
i never wanted to be in the black market .
i'm a scientist .
now , i'll work for science and for france .
no more like a thief in the night .
thank you .
thank you .
goodbye .
thank you again .
goodbye .
nice little guy .
so , you found him ...
i ran into him .
someone i knew , knew him .
he was very anxious to go , as you heard .
it was easy .
yeah , easy .
easy .
go ahead , start hollering , calling me names ...
guten morgen .
was darf sein , bitte?
bitte , haben sie kaffee?
zwei , bitte .
just a minute , do you speak english?
sure .
you know , there's nothing i've ever really wanted in life .
fame , money , position .
nothing , until now .
there's just one thing : never to see you again as long as i live .
that was a rotten thing to say ...
will you get the coffee , please?
that was mean rotten .
maybe , but it wasn't accidental .
fortunately , i'm leaving the army .
i'll be a civilian .
never again can they order me to work with you .
i'm going back to heidelberg by train .
get some other chump to torture in that sidecar .
i know why you're mad .
i don't blame you , i would be too .
i knew it was your last job .
i didn't think , i spoiled it for you .
i'd give anything if i hadn't .
i'd cut off my arm , almost .
i like you , henri .
i can't help it .
you're stubborn and you don't know anything , but i don't want you to disappear without saying you'll write , or kick me , or use my toothbrush .
i wouldn't put it past you .
after all we've been to each other .
and all we haven't been .
after all we've done together .
and all we haven't .
i know that's not your fault .
it's mine and i feel ...
i'm making a fool of myself .
now , get out or say something nice .
i don't know , catherine ...
that was nice , henri .
please , say more .
if we're going to get back before dark , we better be going .
henri ...
but , catherine , just one thing .
pay for the coffee .
yes , henri .
what happened?
you went to sleep so i pulled over .
i thought this would be better .
thank you .
i've been thinking .
why do we fight all the time?
you tell me .
sex antagonism , i guess .
what does that mean?
i think it means just the opposite of what it sounds like .
i can't even think what it sounds like .
henri , i think it means we like each other , but won't admit it .
i'd like it distinctly understood ...
if i weren't so sleepy ...
don't do it .
go to sleep .
i will .
are you all right?
go back to sleep .
why are we stopping?
i want to see a man about a road .
i'll be back in a minute .
take your time .
aufwiedersehen !
henri !
henri !
i like you very much .
in fact , i'd miss you if you weren't here .
henri , stop !
come back !
henri !
oh , no ...
catherine , now that i've told you how i feel ...
my , this is terribly bumpy .
look out !
catherine !
catherine !
darling , are you all right?
where are you?
yes , i'm here .
i'm coming .
i can hear you , but i can't find you .
darling , are you all right?
where are you?
here i am , over here .
there you are .
darling , thank goodness you're safe .
how did you get out there?
wait a minute .
i'm all out of breath from chasing you .
chasing me?
you weren't on the motorcycle?
you were by yourself .
you got off and left me .
henri , what's all this " darling " business you were mumbling about?
darling?
did i say that?
i heard you .
probably fright , it's natural .
did you mean me?
i think i was stunned momentarily .
maybe , but you looked like you were going to kiss me when you saw me .
i what?
i wish you had .
i've never been kissed by a frenchman .
what's so strange about that?
you know what people say .
that's nonsense .
you hear people talk ...
we're no different than anybody else .
i don't know , i've just heard talk .
that's silly .
why don't you try it and let me see?
catherine ...
it's the only way to find out .
but it's so silly .
no harm in trying , is there?
i suppose not .
all right , go ahead .
are you ready?
sure .
that was no good , that wasn't different at all .
i told you it wouldn't be .
i thought it'd be better than that .
you didn't give me much of a chance .
that wasn't fair .
of course it wasn't .
i ought to give you another chance .
yes , you ought .
go ahead , try again .
all right .
come here .
well , that was a little better .
see?
could've been even better if i'd had some co operation .
if i'd had a french girl here ...
what do you mean by that remark?
you haven't been giving me much help .
you think a french girl could do better?
yes , i do .
do you want to try again?
yes .
so do i.
wait a minute .
lean back .
comfortable?
yes .
major , we want to get married .
when did you reach that decision?
this afternoon , about 2 : 30 .
in a haystack , henri was on the motorcycle ...
i don't think the major will be interested in the details .
and you two didn't want to go away together .
it would seem your mission was very successful .
thank you .
congratulations .
you're the first to know .
i guessed as much .
as to getting married , there's one hitch .
itch?
it's probably the haystack ...
i don't ...
hitch .
marriages between american military personnel and aliens , and you come under that heading , must be approved by the general .
there's a set procedure .
it's only red tape .
do you itch , catherine?
she said " hitch " .
we've got to get things approved .
here are the forms .
fill them out in quadruplicate .
when completed , send them to the colonel's office .
and good luck .
goodbye , captain .
yes .
is she always so confusing?
no , but this will be .
look at all this stuff we've got to fill in .
she said there were only four .
you misheard .
she said four of each .
let's go to my room to work .
fine .
wait a minute .
souvenir .
you'll end up with a pocketful .
this is impossible .
don't give up now , we're half way through .
my uncle's politics , my aunt's religion , any warts ...
by the way , my aunt's name is fanny .
put that down .
any identifying scars on my second cousin's clavicle ...
we'll never get this done .
name your father's gender " .
no ...
it says so .
no , father's birthplace .
gender belongs to this question .
i thought there was something wrong .
idiot .
were you ever captured by peruvian indians?
no , why?
i understand they do a good job of shrinking heads .
come on , let's take time out .
there are a lot of things i'd rather do than answer questions .
this , for instance?
maybe i better go back and see another double feature .
no , come on in .
we're still filling out forms .
if anyone wants to do that with me , let me know .
i'm going to sleep .
good night .
we've got to get busy .
why do we have to go through all this?
it's the army's way of finding out if you really want to get married .
i know a much better way .
mayor prendergast .
yes .
at ease , gates .
that'll be all right .
well , gates?
i'm sorry to bother you , but we haven't heard a word in over a week .
your papers must've bogged down .
isn't there something you can do?
he's getting nervous , and so am i.
i'll see what i can do .
i'll let you know .
thank you , major .
gates ...
yes?
he is worth waiting for , isn't he?
he is now .
i don't know what he'll be like by the time i get him .
i can't understand her marrying a foreigner she hardly knows .
it's ridiculous and disgraceful .
i can't see why she wants to .
you better get glasses .
why are you women such pushovers for this parlez vous hand kissing?
hand kissing?
he does more than that .
catherine told me he was plum crazy , chasing her and beating her up .
he left marks all over her , i saw them .
he could leave marks on me any time .
i'd bring the stick .
it wasn't a stick .
he kicked her right in the ...
what?
he did .
hi , catherine .
we were just talking about you .
i bet you were .
well , say something .
did you see her?
don't lose your temper .
the papers are stuck somewhere .
stuck how?
bogged down , lying on someone's desk .
what for?
henri , please .
i don't know .
they let other people get married .
what've they got against you?
me?
it'll be you they're investigating .
nonsense .
why should they?
please .
there are other people here .
why should they investigate me?
because the american army is very careful .
they better be , or they won't have any american children .
will you lower your voice?
i'll do better .
i'll take it somewhere else .
do that .
and while you're about it , go bag your oars .
bag your oars?
what's that?
more army talk?
navy .
naval talk .
charming .
you make me sick .
good .
henri ...
excuse me .
catherine , let me ask you something like a brother .
do you really want to marry that phoney joker?
certainly not .
you're kidding?
i hope he chokes , slowly .
very slowly .
that's what i said .
a girl like you couldn't make a mistake like that .
thank heavens for army red tape .
don't thank the army .
thank me , personally .
you?
why?
i hid the papers .
i knew you'd change your mind .
you hid the papers?
i knew i was doing you a favour .
you hid the papers ...
i filed them .
i don't mind going out on a limb for a friend .
it was taking a chance , sure ...
now , your marriage .
catherine , you want me to marry you in my church .
and you , henri , promised the pastor of your parish he'd do the job .
yes .
you better have both marriages .
i think he's right , henri .
let's get started .
just a moment .
there's more to it .
under german law , recognised by the occupying army , you have to go through a civil ceremony before the church ceremony .
so you have to be married by the burgermeister in heidelberg and then , come to me , and then go to henri's pastor .
that makes three times .
three?
in china , the bride and groom drink tea out of the same bowl , that's it .
are you chinese?
of course not .
i thought not .
i'm not .
what brought that up?
you mentioned drinking tea .
i was telling the chaplain ...
i'll drink tea with you .
stop it .
perhaps i shouldn't go through with this .
you can still say no .
we'll go to the burgermeister and come back .
i'll be ready , any time .
thank you .
don't pay any attention to her .
goodbye .
goodbye .
captain henri rochard , catherine gates ...
you've decided to live your future life together .
... and forsaking all others , keep thee only unto him , so long as you both shall live?
i will .
please join right hands .
henri , will you repeat after me ,
i , henri ... take thee , catherine ... to be my wedded wife ...
he wants the ring .
i haven't got it .
here .
je t'pouse avec cet anneau .
well , like it?
i like it .
it's been quite a day .
we're a lot married , three times .
it was worth it .
i don't see how we could ever get a divorce .
it would be like unwinding the inside of a golf ball .
want some more coffee?
i just had four cups .
besides , it keeps me awake .
what's the matter?
i'm just thinking about a friend on his wedding night .
what happened?
you see , he was ...
pardon , monsieur .
il y a quelque chose que vous voulez?
non , non , non .
bon soir .
tell me about it .
what?
your friend , on his wedding night .
i'm not so sure i can tell you .
of course you can .
that's right , i can now , can't i?
well , here's what happened ...
this is just like my friend's story .
now what?
can i come in?
you're in .
i didn't want to come , but ...
then go away .
kitty , why are you here?
i thought you'd gone back .
of all the times ...
what do you want , anyway?
i certainly didn't want to come here .
then go away .
i've got something to tell you and you're not going to like it .
what?
the colonel gave orders you're to leave for heidelberg in 20 minutes .
you're kidding !
the whole outfit's going back to america .
america?
well , not right away .
we don't have to leave tonight .
maybe you don't , but catherine does .
those are orders .
when do i have to report?
not until morning .
then we stay here , fly back and report in the morning .
tell the colonel you couldn't find us .
he said if i tried to pull that one , we'd both be sorry .
i'm in a spot , so are you .
get working on henri's passport , or he won't be able to sail with you .
henri , we're dead .
this is a fine wedding night !
find a place to stay in heidelberg , it's better than nothing .
what do you mean , nothing?
start packing .
you've only got 20 minutes .
how do we get back from here?
plane to frankfurt , there'll be a jeep there .
see you later .
orders are i'm to stick with you till you get back to heidelberg .
orders ...
orders?
orders ...
they wouldn't do this in the french army .
poor henri ...
want me to wait for you?
what do you mean?
all night?
i don't think it'll be that long .
what trouble are you dreaming up now?
bachelor officers 'quarters .
i don't care .
that's where i live and where i'll take my wife .
it's against regulations .
who cares about regulations at a time like this?
besides , i know the sergeant and he always looks the other ...
he's a very nice fellow from tulsa , oklahoma .
please take the lieutenant home .
goodnight , kitty .
goodnight .
come along .
but ...
please .
goodnight , kitty .
goodnight .
hope it works .
leave it to me .
it's just us .
b. o. q means .
bachelor officers 'quarters .
we went to six hotels , and they're all against regulations ...
what's the matter?
billings is on the couch .
thompson and kay are in the bedroom .
what are they doing here?
sleeping .
come on .
where?
since time began , man has always found a place for his mate , even if it was a cave .
tonight , mankind's a flop .
you haven't a cave or even a bed ...
it's 3 am and it's my wedding night ...
my feet hurt , i couldn't walk another step ...
yes , darling , yes .
do you want to sleep here?
no .
i mean yes , but i want you to sleep here too .
you can bunk up with me and he can sleep in the bathroom .
sitting up?
it's not so bad .
i slept in a bathtub once .
on your wedding night?
no .
i'll get you some blankets and a pillow .
come along , dear .
how could it turn out like this?
i always planned a wonderful ...
i know , i know .
come on .
the bathroom's there .
goodnight , henri .
good night , dear .
oh , everything's wrong .
i can't wear my new nightgown , there isn't any rice ...
maybe kitty has some mothballs .
i don't think it's funny .
me , in one room and you , in a bathtub ...
yes , dear , but never mind .
goodnight , darling .
don't cry , i'll be all right .
i'll be quite comfortable .
i'll just turn on the cold water .
come on , henri , hurry up .
we've a lot to do .
i am hurrying .
this is as fast as i can go .
straighten up , you look like a question mark .
thank you .
that's better .
what a place to put a faucet , in the middle of my back .
it is unusual .
cheer up , tonight you'll have a bed to sleep on .
that's just it .
i don't mean to sound cranky , but this is so unnatural ...
i'll be at b. o. q and you'll be miles away .
all because the army ...
we haven't time to look for somewhere else , we have to see the consul .
come on .
what are you doing in the gutter?
where else would i be?
i know it's very important and you're in a hurry , but it won't be easy .
captain , have you any money in the us?
no .
and the laws of your country only allow you to take a nominal amount .
yes , that's right .
a visitor's visa is no good , you couldn't take a job .
and unless your wife can prove she's able to support you , you couldn't get a permanent visa .
catherine isn't going to support me .
is there any other kind of visa?
what about the french quota?
it's filled up for this year and next .
what'll we do?
i was wondering if public law 271 would apply .
that's the one regulating immigration of war brides .
catherine doesn't have to immigrate , she's an american citizen .
i was thinking of you as the bride .
that's a good imagination you have there .
it says " spouses " , it doesn't mention sex .
i'm convinced the american army doesn't believe in it .
this is going to work .
yes , i think this will work .
sure it will .
this is wonderful .
what?
spouses means mates .
it doesn't say male or female .
we're mates , right?
i really wouldn't know ...
you're a spouse of a member of the american expedition .
therefore , you're eligible to travel under section 271 , as her bride .
as her bride?
henri ...
your bride?
it'll be fun .
i know it's ridiculous , but it'll work .
it's the only way .
here's the application .
i'm not going to travel as her bride .
besides , her name's rochard .
excuse me , but officially , it's still gates .
no , officially , it is rochard .
i have 3 certificates to prove it .
henri ...
i don't care .
rochard .
rochard .
pay no attention .
what do we have to do?
fill out your name , rank , organisation , wife's maiden name ...
she hasn't got a wife .
just for the time being .
have you got a wife?
no , but it's only a piece of paper .
obviously , these applications are intended for the husband .
i can write .
we know , dear .
you can write .
no , this doesn't apply to you .
just make the proper adjustments .
what?
on these papers .
you want to go , don't you?
well , it's the only way .
hand them over to the immigration officer when you've filled them out .
thank you .
catherine ...
it'll be simple , you'll see .
on the contrary , turning a man into a woman is enormously complicated .
but , i'll do my best .
thank you , good day .
goodbye .
goodbye .
just a moment .
brides first .
i beg your pardon .
that's all right .
hello , henri .
well , nothing happened .
hasn't it come yet?
i wonder if it even arrived .
i handed it to the immigration officer myself .
henri , brace yourself .
i'm leaving .
our whole outfit leaves tonight .
tonight?
that does it .
we're cooked .
the application will come this afternoon .
it won't .
you'll go and i'll sit here , wondering which sex i am .
a marriage of solitary confinement .
i've never been so lonely .
if i have to leave you , i'll shoot myself .
shoot me too .
i think this is it .
it came to the office .
thank you , kitty .
at last ...
dear madam ...
that's me .
following application of your husband ... " that's you . " ... permission to enter the us as a war bride has been granted " .
i've got to go , see you later .
i'm so happy .
kiss me .
we've time , that can wait .
or maybe not .
no , henri , the letter .
please fill in a test form and bring to this office ...
another form .
will they ever run out?
i won't .
i won't answer those questions .
this isn't so bad .
i won't answer those questions !
you've got to .
you don't want to stay , do you?
no .
then you've got to answer .
how can i?
you can .
perhaps the man at the office will help you .
impossible .
control yourself and be nice .
everything will be all right .
read it on the way .
goodbye and good luck .
i tell you , there isn't another form .
i told you first .
this form is for a woman .
on the other hand , if you don't fill it out , you can't go .
that's right .
i've got to use this form .
i felt the same way , but if it's the only form , let's fill it out .
well , let's see .
age and birth place , we've got .
are you an expectant mother?
yes ...
how many months?
20 .
20?
20 months ...
any female trouble?
nothing but , sergeant .
have you had children before?
my aching back ...
you know that awful feeling before breakfast?
no , i don't .
you're lucky .
this doesn't make any sense .
i know , but we've got to fill it out .
ask another , there are some good ones .
attention , please .
attention , please .
will mrs milton come to the desk , please?
take seat 18 in bus number 3 .
mrs. rochard .
take seat 19 in bus number 3 .
thank you .
wait a minute .
you're not mrs. rochard .
i'm mr. rochard .
it's your wife who must report for transportation to bremerhaven .
according to the war department , i am my wife .
you can't be your wife .
if the american army says i can be , who am i to dispute that?
this is all wrong .
major , for your information , i am a war bride .
a war bride?
i'm slightly confused .
i am a alien spouse of female personnel , en route to the us under public law 271 of the congress " .
this is a strange situation , but i suppose it's legal .
yes , it is .
well , mrs ...
mr. rochard , it won't be necessary for you to stop at the nurse's desk .
no?
attention , please .
all passengers must have their baggage checked before boarding .
all passengers must have their baggage checked before boarding .
mrs. turner , please come to the desk .
mrs. turner , please come to the desk .
he's crying , the baby .
is that what he's doing?
he wants water , yes?
i wouldn't know .
when i want water , i ask for it differently .
he's a baby .
you are a man .
thanks .
i'll get him some water .
you hold the baby .
i ...
i'll only be a minute .
i don't know anything ...
oh , my god .
yes , yes ...
yes , yes ...
attention , please .
ladies , please stop moving and stay where you are till i finish .
this is the first leg of your journey to the us as guests of the army .
arrangements have been made for your comfort at the dependents hotel .
you'll be able to get all you need at the px there , such as lipstick , hairnets , garter belts , foundation garments ...
a lot of you have asked about the latest styles in the us .
hair is being worn shorter , close to the head .
skirts are long and rather hippy , the full blown look .
the trend is to the natural bust line .
between us , girls , looking around , i don't think any of you need worry .
now , if you'll move out in order , the buses are ready .
happy journey , ladies .
he has to be here somewhere .
look .
henri , you look so maternal ...
what is that?
a human fire extinguisher .
want to try?
come on ...
he's cute .
what's his name?
nigara .
henri , what a thing to do .
where's the mother?
she went to get more water .
she ought to get a plumber .
you've got to get out .
how can we ...?
there's the mother .
i'm sorry .
oh , darling ...
mr. rochard .
your seat on the bus has been changed .
you're sitting with the driver .
i thought i could sit with you .
you can't , kitty and i are flying .
the whole outfit's going .
come on .
no !
i'll be there to meet you .
will we be together in bremenhaven?
i hope so .
i'll try .
if not , i won't sit with the driver .
do you want me to carry that?
no , thank you ...
darling , was it bad?
30 women .
with the exception of you , i may never talk with another .
poor henri ...
let's get away .
where do we go?
you don't , henri .
i don't?
you couldn't fix it?
they wouldn't hear of it .
i'm in building 11 and you stay here .
isn't there any chance?
i've argued for an hour .
i'm learning what it is to be a soldier's wife .
i know , dear .
i feel the same way .
tomorrow on the boat , it'll be different .
i've got to go now .
come on , kitty .
i'll meet you on the dock tomorrow .
get a good night's sleep .
that's all i'll be getting .
hello and goodbye .
hello and goodbye , hello and goodbye ...
... your name on the list , you understand there'll be a wait , because we've a lot of people to attend to .
fill out the form and bring it back , and i'll see what i can do .
i'm sorry , visiting hours are over .
you can see your wife tomorrow .
my wife will have to visit me , i'm billeted here .
you are?
but you can't ...
lieutenant .
there must be some mistake .
no mistake .
i'm an alien spouse of female military personnel en route to the us , under public law 271 of the congress .
good grief .
the record shows 139 war brides , 126 children of war brides , 9 dogs , 3 cats , 2 canaries , one parrot ...
oh , yes .
here you are .
then , me .
you must've been added later .
one war bride , male " .
is that you?
that's me .
there's a problem .
why?
you can't stay here .
i have to , i'm billeted here .
if you insist .
we already have 3 to 10 women in every room .
to say nothing of the dogs and cats .
i mean , you can't stay here .
i can't stay here .
the place for you is the officers 'billet in the staging area .
it won't be half as interesting .
it's just down the street , the third building on the left .
thank you very much .
thank you .
hello .
hello .
i suppose you wonder what i want here .
i will , if you want me to ...
i'm an alien spouse of female military personnel en route to the us , under public law 271 of the congress .
i'm a war bride .
no kidding?
that's interesting .
would it interest you enough to give me a bed?
you can't sleep here , mack .
why not?
are you an american officer?
no .
you can't sleep here .
go to the dependents hotel .
i have just come from the dependents hotel .
the one in bremerhaven?
i mean the one down at the staging area .
i'm too tired to walk all that distance .
suit yourself , mack , but you can't sleep here .
there must be a bed that's free .
you must have one , where is it?
across the street .
my wife's in it .
and you can't ...
of course not .
quite right .
naturally .
well ...
oh , brother .
down this way .
this is awfully kind of you , sergeant .
i'm a private , but you've got to sleep somewhere .
you won't get in trouble , will you?
what can they do?
bust me to civilian?
it ain't the ritz , but it should do .
it's fine .
i'm grateful to find a friend like you .
where do you live?
brooklyn .
i'll look you up when i get there .
get a good sleep .
no , thank you .
wake up .
no , thank you .
what are you doing here?
i had a feeling .
i'm an alien spouse of female military personnel en route to the us , under public law 271 of the congress .
why aren't you at the dependents hotel?
i am writing a book about that .
you see , i'm not a woman .
that's too bad .
but i tell you one thing : you can't sleep here .
note i have not taken off my clothes in anticipation .
where will i go?
i don't know , but you ... ... can't sleep here .
we're agreed .
where will i go?
the only place left is a german hotel , but you're a dependent .
you come under military law and german hotels are out of bounds .
where will i go?
i don't know .
i'm sorry , but there's an army rule and you ... ... can't sleep here .
i beg your pardon .
where will you go?
i don't know .
it's a shame .
if we was in brooklyn , you could've slept with the old man .
hiya .
oh , hi .
what can i do for you?
i'm looking for a place to sleep .
can you help me?
afraid not .
nothing but women sleeping in there .
i know , building 11 .
my wife's in there .
a lot of people's wives are in there .
have you ever noticed women always get a place to sleep .
why is that?
i suppose it's because they're the weaker sex .
i believe they're stronger .
do you know why?
because they get enough sleep .
i'm sorry i can't help you .
very kind of you , corporal .
good night .
are you from brooklyn?
yonkers .
what are those?
good night , buddy .
i'm am an alien spouse of female military personnel en route to the us , under public law 271 .
i've been all over looking for a place to sleep .
you poor man .
you can't stay here .
this is a female building .
it is?
another women's building .
i've come to the conclusion that american men don't sleep .
well , not in this building .
would there be any objection to me sitting here for a while?
imagine i'm waiting for something .
it depends on what you imagine you're waiting for .
i don't want to send you out on a night like this .
very kind .
that's nice .
tell me , what part of the us do you come from?
boston , massachusetts .
massachuchu ...
is there a place called yonkers?

i was wondering ...
i'm a little mixed up .
may i hold that for you?
thanks .
i just got married .
where's your wife?
she's in a female building , building 11 .
and you couldn't find a bed anywhere?
no .
well , almost .
there was one in brooklyn , and another with a woman in it .
he was a very disagreeable man .

her husband .
it would've been nicer in brooklyn .

i'm trying to think ...
you know a lot of dames , sam .
i know a billie ...

i knew if you kept your temper it'd be all right .
i thought i behaved quite well .
you did .
room b14 , lieutenant .
thank you .
how did you get here?
this is for war brides and military personnel .
i know .
my name is rochard .
you'll think i'm a bride , but actually i'm a husband .
there'll be some confusion , but if we keep our heads , it'll be fine .
i don't think it will .
i've got a mrs. rochad on my list .
rochard .
she's in a88 , with two brides and three children .
that will have to be altered .
not by me .
i've just explained to the army , they understood and passed you .
the army passed you .
that's fine , that's just dandy .
did you hear?
the army understood and passed him .
this is the navy , bud .
i have had weeks of the us army and am quite prepared to take on the us navy .
and the navy is quite prepared to take you on .
get this guy off .

just a minute .
have you eve heard of a women called henri?
yeah , henrietta , from san francisco .

you shouldn't have lost your temper .
where are you going?
to change back into a man .
i'm tired of being my own wife .
wait , you can't give up now .
make them give up someone has to .
once on board , everything will be over and you'll be a man forever .
it's worth a try , isn't it?
how can we?
i don't know ...
would you take this bag?
i left something on the bus .
i'll have someone put it in the mess hall .
thanks .
what were you saying?
do you love me?
of course .
you'll make one more try to get aboard?
if you say so ...

promise .
you'll keep it?
i promised , didn't i?

here's a better one .
whoa , boy .
what are you doing?
come on , lean down .
lean down .
i want to see something .
that goes perfectly .
with what?
give me your knife .
you're not going to ...?
i won't do it .
it'll make a perfect wig .
and we've got the clothes .
i will not do it .
you said you loved me .
i'm not so sure .
you promised .
give me your knife .
come on , there's not much time .
this is ridiculous .
can't you at least cut it off the mane?
you're taking this too personally .
stand so no one can see .
it's a little thick .
it won't be so bad when i get your bangs rolled .
want to see?
horrible .
i don't think i'll have to defend my honour .
i doubt it .
a pity .
i wonder if some lipstick would help .
no .
why not?
i'm the outdoor type .
seabiscuit , bangtail , you know .
silly .
hold still .
let me roll these .
wait , i forgot something .
can you talk like a woman?
like this?
awful .
can't you do any better?
no .
all right , then not a word , leave everything to me .
and keep your head down .
would you put this in the mess hall for me , please .
thank you .
wait a moment .
did you hear that?
i must look pretty good .
don't be silly , that was for me .
i ought to punch him in the nose .
remember , you're a lady .
oh , yeah ...
we have our boarding cards .
we've been up before .
go ahead .
i don't remember the tall one .
it's hard to forget a face like that .
yeah .
lieutenant gates , b14 .
i was up before .
yes .
your orders , please .
this is funny .
rochard ...
why aren't you listed among military personnel?
save your voice , dear .
excuse her , she has laryngitis .
what was that?
why isn't she listed among the military personnel?
she was just married .
that may be , but ...
red , come here .
what's the trouble?
this lieutenant's listed as a mrs.
why did they put you down as ...?
how do you do?
why did they put you down as mrs instead of lieutenant?
she has laryngitis , she can't talk .
maybe it was because of her husband .
who did she marry?
admiral rochard .
who?
admiral rochard .
the name's familiar , but i don't remember an admiral .
you never heard of her husband?
he won't like that .
florence , if i were you , i wouldn't say a word .
you heard him , red , admiral rochard .
yeah , maybe i have .
all right .
room a88 , lieutenant .
get your instructions in the mess hall .
thanks .
come , florence .
first time i ever felt sorry for an admiral .
cams aren't bad .
now , i'm beginning to feel sorry for you .
in here , please .
we were ...
please , your instructions first .
come on , florence .
i don't like that name .
shut up .
kitty ...
no ...
stand on the other side so they can't see .
they wouldn't let him on ...
henri , duck down .
i can hear .
you're too tall .
duck down .
he looks awful .
i didn't have much to work with .
have you got a room?
yes , but they wouldn't let a thing like that in .
we've got to hide him somewhere till the boat sails .
we better not stand here .
someone's spotted him .
we need a nurse .
it's an emergency .
will you come with me?
i'm a nurse .
come along .
i hadn't counted on this .
very lucky to find a nurse .
what's the matter?
my wife's expecting a baby .
what?
oh , no ...
it isn't very convenient , is it?
you can say that again .
it isn't very convenient , is it?
no , no it isn't .
i wonder if it'll be a girl .
i'll be grateful if it's a baby .
you will?
you're very kind .
i wish i knew what was going on .
you won't have long to wait .
i won't?
gee whiz , i don't think i can stand this .
you've got a bigger shock coming .
i have?
she got dizzy .
thank you , i'll take care of her .
i'll get you some water .
pardon me .
this is the father .
how do you do .
is it a boy , or a girl?
what happened to him ...?
well , if it isn't florence ...
arrest that man .
it's all right , henri .
the ship has sailed .
come on , flo .
florence ...
may we come in?
i don't see how i can stop you , the key's on the outside .
henri , this is lieutenant perkins and commander willis , the chaplain .
chaplain?
oh , no ...
no , nothing doing .
i'm sorry , chaplain .
nothing doing what?
no more marriages .
i won't marry her again .
that won't be necessary , mr. rochard .
everything's straightened out .
sorry about the mix up , but your case was unusual .
you're an alien spouse of female personnel en route to the us , under public law 271 of the congress .
am i now?
under the circumstances , the captain would like to forget the whole thing .
don't you understand?
you're free to go .
where?
anywhere on the ship .
you're bunked in with an officer .
he doesn't mind .
i think he would mind .
he won't like that .
i snore terribly .
you don't snore .
how would you know?
couldn't we do something simple?
couldn't i just stay here?
i suppose ...
i don't see why not .
thank you , that's very nice .
you've been a great help .
good night .
thank you very much .
you wouldn't .
yes , i would .
i believe you would .
how will we ever get out of here?
i'm not going to worry about that until i see the statue of liberty .
