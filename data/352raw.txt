'cause , ah , 'cause you got them .
what have you got?
welcome to l. a. 's automated traffic surveillance and control operations center .
see , they use video feeds from intersections and specifically designed algorithms to predict traffic conditions , and thereby control traffic lights , so all i did was come up with my own kick ass algorithm to sneak in , and now we own the place .
you want to do a dry run?
i thought you'd never ask .
see , red light?
green light .
danielson?

the look on steve's face .
you're early .
i'm in a hurry .
of course , you know that the florida vote rigging was a cla and mob operation .
is that so?
yeah , which is not so very different from when your john f. kennedy won a rigged election with the help of his father .
you're uncomfortable that i mentioned it .
no , yevhen , i don't like making two trips .
you americans .
you love your heroes .
a holiday for columbus?
he makes the wrong turn , and wipes out an entire indigenous people .
and you know what he was looking for?
i bet you're going to tell me .
gold .
supposedly for queen lsabella , but don't think that the medicis back in ltaly didn't want a part of that action .
and what did ltaly need gold for?
for the long distance slave trade based in venice .
venice ... that's where these bricks ...
you were saying something?
nothing ...
no ...
no , you were really on a roll there .
don't stop .
i'm interested .

what did you tell him?
i told him that i'd seen some bricks .
i'm sorry .
what did this man look like?

iong black hair , big tattoo on his neck .
he must have weighed at least 400 pounds .
i know that guy .
baby , go relax .

you're mashkov .
that's right .
you were asking about gold bricks with a balinese dancer on them .

steve just called to confirm his 8 : 00 reservation at the water grill .
okay , let's go over it one more time .
gas the guards , doors open 8 : 15 .
safe popped by 8 : 25 .
loaded by 8 : 35 , out the door by 8 : 45 .
straight to union station .
only green lights on your route .
the rest of the city's red .
cops are stuck in the traffic , like everyone else .
train leaves at 1 0 : 00 .
cars have to be on the carrier by 9 : 30 .
timing's got to be dead on .
let's get ready .
let's get it .
wow , that is a nice car .
sorry , rob .
coast is clear , guys .
this is it , guys .
moment of truth .
what the hell is this?
shit !
steve's neighbor's throwing a party .
are you here for the , uh , baker party , sir?
no .
we're not blowing any gates tonight , guys .
too many witnesses .
stella .
i know , i know .
i'm late for my date .
yeah , and you got to be charming .
you'll need him to ask you out again .
sorry .
let's get out of the street .
i really can't imagine you doing that .
what's that supposed to mean?
well , you don't really seem
iike the adventurous type , you know?
don't let the cable uniform , you know , throw you .
i wasn't making assumptions .
i've made some assumptions about you .
oh , really?
and?
well ... you're just going to have to wait and see .
why wait?
let's get a check .
let's go back to my place .
no assumptions ...
not tonight .
it's late .
i should go home .
what , you have a cable company curfew?
no , but i've made some bad calls in the past .
hey .
we should take this maybe a little slower , you know?
this lovely dinner , sparkling conversation you still don't trust me?
oh , i trust everyone .
it's the devil inside them i don't trust .
it's an interesting saying .
it's charming .
where'd you pick that up?
can't remember .
really?
i knew a guy who said it exactly like that .
really?
yeah .
he's the only person i've ever heard say that .
he said it all the time .
his name was john bridger .
you're hurting my wrist .
he had a daughter and she was about your age .
let go of my wrist .
i knew that there was something familiar about you .
you're exactly like your old man , you know that?
i liked him , too , right from the start .
i liked him right up until the minute i shot him .
who are you working with?
she's with us .
gang's all here .
you know , the only thing worse than a thief , bendel?
a coward .
then you should have seen the way your daddy begged for his life .
it's not worth it .
put a leash on your cat .
hi , steve .
charlie .
not bad , charlie .
really , not bad .
you have no idea how hard it is for me not to reach across this table and kill you with my bare hands .
you know better than that , charlie .
can't let emotion into these things .
tell me it wasn't about emotion when you shot john and left us all for dead .
that wasn't about emotion .
it was about a lot of gold , and i wanted it .
anything you think you deserved , you didn't .
hey , don't talk about right and wrong with me , man ,
'cause i just don't give a shit .
okay?
you got your cards , i got my cards , we made our play , and i came out on top , okay?
now if you want to start the game up again , that's fine with me .
but what , i mean , what is your play here , really?
i mean , come on , what do you ... what do you think?
y you'll try to take out my guards , right?
i have five of them that you don't know about .
you'll try to have lyle hack the system .
i'll change it again tomorrow morning .
what , what , what was y your final move?
i mean , you were going to have bridger's daughter come in and try to crack my safe?
i mean , that's ... that's very poetic and all , but i just don't see it .
i don't think she'll get anywhere near it .
same old steve , huh?
always thinking defensively .
that's why you're always number two .
how do you figure that?
you got no imagination .
couldn't even decide what to do with all that money .
you had to buy what everybody else wanted .
oh ... well , try this on in your imagination , okay?
that gold is already gone .
that's bullshit , steve .
no , really , it's over charlie .
i'm trying to move the last two bricks .
you want to come after me over a couple of lousy bricks?
i mean , really , be my guest .
but you're off to a bad start , you know?
'cause you just blew the best thing you had going for you .
you just blew the element of surprise .
surprised?
it's over when i say it's over .
are you all right , sir?
how you doing?
good ... considering ... considering the fact that i'm doing all of this for a man i barely knew .
you know what bothered me all those years , charlie?
it was that , whenever he'd call me to tell me that he was on some job ,
i knew you were right there with him .
you got to know him a lot better than i did .
just 'cause he was around me more doesn't mean he wasn't thinking about you all the time .
be nice if it was true .
it is true .
he always regretted not having been a good enough father to you , stella .
how do you know that?
because he told me .
what did you do to your hand?
i punched steve .
why do you get to punch him and i don't?
those hands are way too valuable .
hey .
okay?
there'll be nothing left of that if you keep rubbing it .
tell mr. frazelli we'll see him at 8 : 00 .
charlie !
he's flying the coop .
when?
his security guard called for a private helicopter at 4 : 00 pm .
there's an armored car service coming to his house at 5 : 00 .
there is a cargo plane scheduled to depart lax at 8 : 00 pm to mexico city .
what if he's moving the safe as a diversion?
we crack it , it's empty , the gold's somewhere else .
steve's not about to let that gold out of his sight .
it's going to be in that truck and he's going to be watching it every step of the way from the helicopter .
so the gold's headed to mexico .
who knows where?
they could change the flight plan in midair .
slow down , slow down .
you guys are looking at this the wrong way .
this is good news for us .
charlie , what do you mean , " good news "?
we've been trying to get to the gold in the safe , now the safe is coming to us .
we're going to boost it in transit .
charlie , it could take a dozen different routes to the airport .
we have no idea which one .
we can't take out an armored truck during rush hour .
we're already set up to do it .
napster , gridlock every route except for the one we choose .
force that truck to go exactly where we want it to go .
where do we want it to go?
we can't have a shoot out with armed guards .
we'd lose .
we do it like the ltalian job .
hello?
why'd you do it?
do what?
yevhen .
you didn't have to clip him .
whoa , whoa .
what are you talking about?
we didn't clip anybody .
yevhen's cousin is under the distinct impression that you did .
why does he think that?
because you want to know about the gold with the balinese dancer .
you told him that?
listen to me , man .
if there's one thing that i know is never to mess with mother nature , mother in laws or mother freakin 'ukrainians .
look , i need a favor .
yeah .
had a hiccup last night .
could use some help .
want hands on this time .
you interested?
could be .
but i don't like to be kept in the dark .
if i'm in , i'm in .
okay , you're in .
all right .
what do you think , charlie?
this'll work .
let's go .
you're amazing .
it's a work of genius .
uh huh .
you okay?
just give me a moment .
now?
i'm about to insert this pin into this detonator tube , and if the brass touches the sides , we'll both be the last people we ever see .
take all the time you need .
hey , charlie .
what?
i love you , man .
i love you , too .
okay .
okay .
your attention , please .

what's wrong?
charlie , you won't believe this .
he's brought in three armored trucks .
it's a shell game .
shell game now .
well , boss , i can't reroute the truck if i don't know which truck to reroute .

there's a pane of glass right here behind this door .
and if i don't drill perfectly through that hole , steel rods snap into place and you can't open the safe .
and then we're up shit creek .
i think i just cracked the glass .
i don't think it broke though .
i can't drill it again .
