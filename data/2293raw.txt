oh my , i don't know what to say .
i'm seeing the coroner tomorrow .
that was fucking horrible .
i was told about davey like he was in love with me .
was there anything that sighted odd to you?
odd?
about what happened .
no one knows what happened .
it's a fucking mystery , ain't it?
it's rather technical .
you may not understand some ...
how do i arrange an independent post mortem?
mister graham , i do understand ...
you are my lawyer .
it was an incontrovertible suicide .
billy , he's back .
i've just seen him .
i've just seen will graham .
you're sure?
i wasn't first , but anyone in that bind up club of his .
looks like a fucking puggy .
just calm down frank .
he's nothing .
nothing to worry about .
who is worried?
take me to the shop .
and find al .
a long time .
we thought we'd lost you .
fuck me , look at you .
he's been sleeping in loft .
scuffy bastard .
enough of meat .
fearless fucker , i'd say .
lost the weight , right will?
i'm leaving but one day .
what can friends say , mate?
he was a lovely kid .
i still can't believe it .
not davey , not that .
why?
i wanna know why .
no pucker knows will .
no one .
that's a fact .
what was he into?
he was always into something .
but we did not know in what .
i mean no one was putting a hand on him , is that what you mean .
everyone loved him , will .
tell me .
there's nothing to tell .
don't lie to me .
he is dead !
what's it matter?
it matters .
of course it fucking matters .
i wanna know why he died and where he died .
i wanna know why he sat in a bath of cold water for 12 hours .
and his clothes .
and then cut his throat .
i want the fucking truth now , talk to me .
he was dealing .
a bit of coke .
nothing new .
everybody sensed a little bit in it .
they're all doing it .
he's right .
i mean davey played it .
you know davey , you know what he was like , will .
was he using it?
he had a smoke once or twice .
that's the truth , will .
how much was he turned in?
there was nearly 11 gram in a fly , you don't get so money dealing with graham .
he was webbed up over beautiful paybill .
he had more money than sent us .
he stiffed them a little .
i didn't ever clue on ever buying .
they go often on lying a pad at fucking rat shits .
i don't know it .
he was working .
eddy gave him a lift .
holland park , i don't drink .
something happened .
i wanna know what .
well , you're back , will .
but are you back?
that'll be something .
the fucking wild punch .
we had this fucking money on the safe .
anyone gets in our way .
everything safe but you take them will .
frank turner may have something to say about that?
he's a fucking crack tag .
he's been busy while i have been away .
he was all over in everything .
one day i'm gonna fuck him where he breves .
it's a lot of soft money up , will .
you could have them over , will .
you put your mind to it .
i'm not back for that .
you think you've changed .
do you?
you haven't changed .
not really .
people like us don't change .
not deep down .
arnie , you're wrong .
you're wrong about most things , most of the time .
you know all your life you raised this city .
it's in your blood .
you think living like a fucking animal in a back of a van is gonna change that .
do you?
cause nothing changes , not really .
you look at frank turner .
he's still bad to the fucking bone .
and he's gonna come for you .
he has to .
it's on you , will !
but you knew that .
you knew that the moment you to stepped back in this city .
you knew that there were gonna be bodies .
someone's going to die .
but there's nothing what you want .
isn't it , will?
you want to die .
or maybe you should do with your fucking brother dealing get over with .
the man doesn't drink .
hello .
what are you doing here?
is there somewhere we can talk?
please .
his brother's back .
davey graham's brother .
will graham .
asking questions .
if he finds out .
what?
what's he gonna find out?
what could he possibly find out?
he's killed people .
yeah , he's scum .
just like his brother .
what happened that night , i mean what did you do to him to make him ...?
that night i was at home with my family .
i thought i'd never see you again .
why are you here , will?
you know why .
davey .
no , i mean why are you here?
here with me now?
i saw you .
i don't want to speak .
i'm sorry , i'd like you to leave .
i stop writing because ,
it was unfair .
unfair?
unfair?
christ .
you must define a better word than that .
i loved you , will .
not as for being who you were .
i've always known who you were .
what you are .
i can't forgive you .
not for leaving me or abandoning me , i
i've come to understand that .
it's that shame and difficult you have of thinking about you are not loved?
believing that you are not capable of being loved?
look at me .
look for what i've become .
i sometimes don't talk to another living soul for fucking days .
weeks .
i'm always on a move , i trust no one , nothing .
and it's got fuck odd to do with escape .
or withdraw or fear .
it's grief .
for a life wasted .
and now there's davey .
another fucking wasted life .
and i'm gonna find out why .
that you loved him almost as much as me .
i thought that you might be able to help .
i thought you'd want to help .
i don't know how to help you .
at least pathologist report was quite comprehensive .
coroner's verdict , of course , inevitable .
however ..
i'm not questioning the suicide verdict .
i just need to know why my brother killed himself .
just try to surmise why anyone takes their own life .
sir , i say what you've got to say?
very well .
was your brother homosexual?
or perhaps bisexual?
was he bisexual?
there was damage to the mucus membrane in his anus .
internal bleeding .
he had an intercourse some time before his death .
what are you talking about?
that wasn't in there?
he's been sitting in a water for at least twelve hours .
it's difficult ...
i've no interest in blaming or criticizing anyone , i just want the complete facts , the truth .
the fact is , there was anal penetration on the night before he died .
he wasn't bisexual .
i knew a woman , who'd been married for thirty years , her husband was bisexual .
she hadn't got a slightest ...
i would have known .
very well .
that leads to one other conclusion .
if your brother wasn't homosexual or bisexual then the act was , to use an illegal term , nonconsensual buggery .
he was raped?
there was no semen on the mouth .
often in rape cases there is forced genital mouth contact .
there was evidence that he ejaculated .
what the fuck are you saying?
it's not uncommon for victims to become aroused during the act .
even ejaculate .
this can cause damaging psychological stress .
if ...
and i do say " if " this happened to your brother , then it might account for the subsequent suicide .
of course none of this would made any fundamental difference of the inquest , the coroner's verdict would have been the same .
i can put you in touch with someone that can explain it a little better than me .
if you'd like it .
if it would help .
if you think , it might help .
'it's kathy , i'm at work , you ring me back .
where were you last night?
you are a sot , davey .
hi , it's sheridan , we go to the party tonight .
i call from linda , my old school friend .
she needs a jump , and she neds a bounce of work .
don't be late davey , you're always late .
still in your favor , it's mickser .
i fall out .
you should be on the run , you still must be running tonight .
ring me up , you lump .
hello .
hallo , is that sheridan?
yes .
i'm a friend of davey's .
can we talk?
it's important .
and he left about what time?
eleven , soon after eleven .
alone?
yes .
did you see him leave?
no .
but i know he wasn't with anyone .
he wasn't at the party that night , i told you .
yeah .
did you noticed anyone leave a sign to him?
no , it was early .
this girl you saw too .
well there was one thing .
the guy she was with .
i saw him waiting while davey and stella were doing that deal .
he had a cellphone .
i just missed davey leaving .
front doors , half way to the lift .
this guy was phoning .
and he looked nervous .
and he's seen davey leaving while he went with stella out of the bedroom .
maybe it's nothing .
maybe he was just nervous because she was scoring .
did you know who he was?
no .
do you think you can find out?
i could ring her .
every victim reacts in a different way .
but there are patterns .
various elements .
there's belief to try to switch off that didn't happen .
couldn't happen to them .
shock .
can and does take all kinds of forms .
some victims say that they feel strangely coming .
one feeling to touch it .
others feel a need to show it .
express sastility , reach .
but sometimes , not often , but in rare cases , i've known at least three , where this disgust .
this terrible anger has turned against themselves .
are you all right?
do you want me to go on?
can i take a drink?
help yourself .
all of the myths is that rapist whether they rape man or woman are idly sexed of insatiable sexual appetites .
all the truth is that they are fundamentally inadequate .
they try to prove themselves to themselves that rape becomes a sort of symbol of the virility .
not willing to trust at sex at all .
rape is much more about domination , humiliation , defining .
it's a kind of power .
more than is to do with any sort of sexual pleasure .
what kind of a man am i looking for?
what the police will be looking for .
he more likely to be heterosexual even married , with kids , could be any reasonable age and the men may have been more than one .
often it's just , older victim done .
was the chance that davey would have known him?
the more likely that the attack came from strangers .
he might have known him ,
i can't really answer that .
you are going to the police .
please .
please let them deal with it .
never did like you .
i mean , look at you now .
like a fucking pukey .
i'm talking to you .
you , useless bag of shit .
message from mister turner .
you bury that brother of yours and you fuck off back the way you come from .
get me?
willy?
and you'll tell those fucking transport as you used to run with .
they get any ideas , they get fucking funny
they are going down all .
she's unbelievable respurred .
she's found stella up right , she's got his name , his address , she's even got his fucking phone number .
said , she's drawing up this guest list for the opening of a new club or something .
at least to send out the invitation .
she's quite annoying , i tell you .
i'm in on of use to think what davey sore to them , but ... son , have eyes that one , no doubt .
will , are you with me?
davey was raped .
what are you talking about?
he killed himself because he was raped .
what a fuck are you talking about?
i had a second post mortem the police pathologist missed .
well , missed?
what?
davey was bugged .
the night before he killed himself .
why do you tell me straight away?
because i knew what you'd be thinking now .
no .
no .
no .
this fact's itself stupid .
yeah , but you're not sure , are you?
don't you lie down on me .
don't you fucking lie down on me !
davey was ...
it was not bang .
fuck you !
fuck you !
what do you say?
nothing .
nothing?
ask irish .
it's a fact mr. turner .
he ain't gonna give no one no trouble .
don't ever underestimate will graham .
he's a fierce man .
we'll go the distance .
you should never have left him like that .
you was wrong , will and you know it .
you never had no family , no one .
he was just a kid .
he was always buying them stuff , he was giving them things .
he knew that he had nothing .
so he went for the soft money .
started dealing , started getting so far it's happening wingst .
i'm telling you .
if davey was raped , he was one of them who did it .
a fucking branchy dildo .
yes .
it's stella .
fine .
i'm davey graham's brother .
all i want is his name .
are you fucking listening?
are you?
i can't , if he knows , he'll kill me .
you are fucking dead already !
do you know what he did to davey?
what i did , was phoning from the flat .
i didn't have any thing to do .
he wouldn't tell me .
he raped him .
that's why davey killed himself .
well his money run clear , ain't them?
he's on call cells with others .
and it's wrong .
we will need this .
we?
i'm coming with you .
no , you're not .
get out of there !
shut up !
go on now , boy !

frank !

that man rapes davey .
you don't understand .
never could you .
you never could .
you say he wants to see this man .
tonight .
what did he say?
i don't know .
i was on move and we were just driving to him .
you didn't ask him?
i did .
he didn't answer .
what do you think he will do?
i don't know .
i really don't .
he's changed .

he didn't wanna know .
i'm sorry .
i'm not here for that .
go to the police , will .
don't do anything .
go to the police .
what can i do without devey's testimony?
that boy from the party , show it to him
all boad has to do is say that davey consented .
i can't just do nothing .
you left him behind .
three years ago .
did i?
that's why you went .

i wanna kill you so badly i can taste it .
i know who you are .
you're just like he was .
so sure of himself .
so certain of what he was .
i was watching him for weeks , you know .
in the parties , at restaurants , clubs .
he was everything i loathed .
the clothes , the walk , the talk , the lies .
the way he smoked .
the way he laughed .
laughing , always laughing , mocking .
everything , everyone .
and i won it .
their eyes like hands on him all the time .
oh my god , what was he?
thief?
drug dealer?
the degenerate?
