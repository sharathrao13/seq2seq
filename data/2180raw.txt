i don't really understand that myself .
was hirohashi bugging you to do something again?
and you couldn't say no?
you're supposed to be the care giver !
i'm glad you came .
i'll go buy a drink .
so that was the first time you'd been there?
yes , it was .
about the child you say you saw there ...
did you find him?
no ... not yet .
'toshio '...
he said his name was toshio .
toshio?
ms nishina , the tokunagas don't have any children .
what?
what about that photograph?
there was a family picture in the house .
that wasn't the tokunagas .
then who was it?
we're looking into that .
detective ...
what happened there?
excuse me .
the families before the tokunagas all died or disappeared , too .
is this all of them?
what about the sister?
we can't find her .
a security guard where she works is dead , too .
and ... ... look at this .
a man named saeki takeo killed his wife kayako there .
later he was found dead on the road by a neighbor .
saeki kayako , 28 , housewife .
she and takeo had a son .
'toshio '...
kayako's body was found ... ... up there under the roof .
hi , daddy !
hi , lzumi .
where's mom?
shopping .
she'll be angry again if you don't get home .
it's ok .
come over here .
why?
come on !
quick !
what is it?
look at this .
did you draw those?
yep !
this is the prince of heaven .
that's the princess .
and that's their baby .
yeah?
and who's this?
mr toyama yuji?
lgarashi , yahara division .
ow !
what is it?
you were in charge of the saeki investigation .
i'd like to talk to you .
izumi , you get on home .
i quit the force .
leave me alone , will you?
two more people have died there .
you're the only one left who was involved with the case .
izumi !
what are you doing there?
did you clean the bath?
it's your turn today , you know .
get going .
was this the boy you saw at the tokunaga house?
yes .
take a good look .
you're sure?
yes , it was him .
did you find him?
no .
he went missing five years ago .
he's never been found .
even if he were alive somewhere , he'd be 11 years old .
huh?
mr nakagawa ...
this is toyama yuji .
he was on that case .
thank you .
my name's nakagawa .
come in .

well?
she's gone , you know .
can you believe that !
ayano , check out the window .
she's there .
she's by the gate .
it looks like she's thinking .
why's she so scared?
maybe she's got esp .
she didn't have to leave !
i'm cold .
yeah .

what's wrong?
lzumi's gone !

lzumi?
it's chiharu and miyuki .
we brought the pictures .
can we come in?
isn't it a bit dark in here?
don't !
lzumi?
what's wrong?
lzumi?
the three of them are looking in ... ... at me .
'the three of them '?
saori and the rest .
the night they disappeared , i was with them .
then why didn't ...
i was scared !
scared of what?
when we came back from the school trip ... ... saori said ...
... there was a haunted house near here .
haunted?
where?
i forget !
how could you forget?
i wanted to !
lzumi , will you tell us what's going on?
even before we went in ... ... i felt something strange .
izumi , do you have esp or something?
i don't .
it's not that .
you guys keep away .
saori and the others treated it as a joke , but i couldn't stay there .
i left , by myself .
i was scared .
i ran away .
they're coming for me !
lzumi , chill out !
close the curtains !
close them !
