i have very high ambitions .
we can do well if everything works down to the smallest detail .
that's why i have to be very focused .
how best to prepare the riders?
tour de france is so important for us
and ... if we do it right , we'll make a difference .
i really envy them .
i miss the kick , and the feeling you get when your legs hurt .
but i also miss the feeling of being better than the rest .
having your legs in good shape ... ... and being able to make it hurt for the others .
i really miss that a lot .
fine .
ride up behind the motorcycle .
catch it .
great .
very good , ivan .
after the motorcycle .
catch it .
the last kilometer .
come on !
lance armstrong .
hunting his 6th victory .
beautiful .
come on , come on !
that's a damn good time .
many times you're like this when you're feeling tense .
it's not easy .
i always spent a lot of time on my bike and my equipment .
so much , sometimes , that it broke down .
i was always trying to get as much as possible out of the components .
then you screw a screw too tight .
or a screw breaks
or a thread is wrecked .
if you don't screw a screw too tight ten times
you'll never know how far you can screw .
you're trying to make me say things that aren't very good .
i'm not making you say ...
no , it's not that ...
you shouldn't be sorry about ...
no , i'm not that good at talking about myself .
i can see that this team sounds a little strange .
that's okay , too .
it's apparently just my life's work .
that's about it .
because that's how it is .
that doesn't necessarily make it less exciting .
for myself , either .
this has been ... ... a kind of a hurdle and has been for quite some time .
to get to the point where i'd allow myself do this .
i can't let myself wonder or worry about
whether others approve of what i'm doing .
the greatest defeat is when others think you're doing things wrong .
i just should have sprinted myself .
he wasn't faster than me .
i don't understand why he didn't take charge .
i cycled my ass off .
i just should have ridden , myself .
kim said i should stay on his tail .
stay on his tail?
then that prick came along .
you should have been much more cool .
but then i ...
already before .
he got to ride , too .
you were supposed to .
i did , when he went cold .
but he kept going , anyway .
but he was right on o'grady's ass .
i'll have to break away again .
not tomorrow .
no , jens will do that .
i'm disappointed , jakob .
i don't care .
why are you disappointed?
i'm just kidding .
it was a joke .
do i have any reason to be disappointed ...?
no .
the yellow t shirt is within reach .
tomorrow you're riding from the start , piil ... ... as usual .
if he uses all that energy the first week ...
if you hadn't lost 9 minutes and were in a breakaway every day ...
those breakaways have put me in shape .
i'm impressed .
he's a star .
he'll win tour de france .
maybe not this year , but one day .
don't tell him that .
excellent .
it's deep enough .
dammit .
i couldn't come under .
i'm training ...
no , no no ...
oh , that .
it's good .
it's coming .
it's before tour de france , you know .
well ...
yes .
you are my friend .
hey , piil?
there'll be no tour de france for me .
i have to warm the milk bottles ... ... when the baby comes .
no .
i'm going to have twenty ...
no , ten .
with me , eleven .
that's enough for a football team .
how's it going?
it's going .
my throat's not so bad , but in general ...
it went reasonably .
yes .
no wind?
we pulled through well .
everyone was in front .
it was well ridden .
we can't do anything with that wind .
we can't come from behind .
jesus christ , ivan .
up in front !
did you see the graphics?
they have this comic book .
i didn't see it .
there's this long field .
a big knife comes down with csc on it
and sticks right through the field .
we're not working for us postal .
they've shown me this .
i understand nothing .
here .
i'm taking it off .
it's not helping .
our doctor says you have to wear it for at least 5 days .
i don't need it .
i'm not worried here , because , when i go out of the room
i feel certain i won't be stabbed in the back .
on other teams , there'd be that chance .
that's a crucial difference .
you understand?
i understand everything .
i understand him .
when the british talk , i understand nothing .
a language is something you sing .
one has to be able to understand when it's sung .
the intonation in the language ...
yes , exactly .
i didn't say one shouldn't understand .
after 3 years with us you'll be speaking all languages .
he's clever , isn't he?
you know what this is about , right?
ow , dammit .
i feel good .
lance , what do you think of the tour?
hey , piil , come on .
don't you know who i am?
okay , lance ...
with the microphone here ... like this .
he didn't say anything .
shall we bet jens is breaking away?
i don't think he is .
i'm in the first line .
i'm going to get going .
yes ...
hi .
i know he needs help .
of course he does , but how much can i help him?
i know i have to leave him alone .
i can't push him too hard .
it's a difficult balancing act to do the right thing for him
and it's very hard to do the right thing for him just now
because he's very frustrated .
that's easy enough to understand .
it's frustrating for us , too
because he's an important man .
i go 360 .
you know ...
i know .
i tell you .
hey , bjarne .
i have ten kilos less than ivan .
ivan is 450 .
i'm training .
not racing .
and you also .
i'm not like this , bjarne .
the computer needs to understand me .
i don't need to understand it .
it's more intelligent than me .
yeah , yeah , for sure ... not maybe .
i won't force him .
not at all .
i'll have to push him if nothing happens in a month's time .
he has to make some decisions in his life .
he has to .
i can't do it for him .
there's not much time .
not to do everything .
it's difficult ...
we're doing a lot .
it's necessary to work well .
if it works ...
the most important is the time from dauphin libr to tour de france .
those are twenty very important days .
polish everything up and achieve the maximum .
i feel pain .
this part and in the gluteus .
i don't feel good .
i have pain .
i'm here because i have pain .
he's feeling a bit strange right now .
i don't know how great his need is .
he must assess what he's capable of .
he can't change what's happened .
the problem is , there are too many people around him on the home front
who don't understand that life goes on .
it's a great strain on him .
he has to take them all into consideration
and you can't do that as a professional bike rider .
you just can't .
very good !
nice work .
nice work , jakob .
my life's greatest wish
was to ride together to the finish line in the mountains
and sprint for the win .
we had the chance in vuelta de espaa 2001 .
but in the interest of the team ...
we were together in the breakaway .
but my team ordered me to wait for joseba beloki .
we could have shared that dream .
it wasn't mine , alone .
jos is someone with whom i've shared a lot .
he's been like my big brother for the last eight years .
i've spent more time with him than with my own brothers .
he was someone i admired because of his perseverance .
there are people without much experience
and with very little personality
but who have a lot of money .
it's very attractive for these kinds of wolves
and people who don't think like us .
we see the world in a different way .
we're stubborn because it's a hard sport .
but we're not built for a world that is organized differently .
when these people come into your world
it's easy for them to destroy your life .
the first time i heard of his problem was a day earlier , in the media .
at one point i was afraid it was over .
but luckily ...
for me , he's one of the world's absolute best bicycle riders .
he's much better than people think ...
much better .
it requires more of you than just enjoying your sport .
it's important for me
that there's a very good relationship
between carlos and you .
very important .
because if you show that you're getting along well together
everyone's happy .
it's important for everyone .
otherwise there'll be two teams .
i don't want that to happen .
the two of them mean a lot to me personally
but also for the team .
they're my two stars .
i have to feel my way .
it's hard to have two , who in theory are competing against each other
become the best of friends .
my greatest wish
is for them to be able to see each other's resources
and take advantage of them and make each of them better .
i will press them to give absolutely all they can .
you can often do much more than you think .
but the last thing i want to do is push them too far .
danish csc have now parked their bicycles
and french journalists are wondering how they succeeded .
that's a direct accusation against me .
yes .
it's serious .
they should come to the training camp and see how we work
in december , january and february .
an italian trainer has been named .
he has previously been under suspicion .
a french journalist says he's a trainer for csc .
that is correct .
one more question .
is his name " cecchini "?
he's a very close friend .
a friend for life .
we develop many things together .
he trains some of my riders .
there's very strict control .
i can't tell you if there still are many who cheat .
i won't reveal names .
i simply can't .
my name would be ruined .
that's why we have such strict rules .
that's important .
i've spoken with a guy from tour de france .
he says that tomorrow ... ... the whole story about di luca will be out .
3 more names will be made public tomorrow . lncluding yours .
mine?
yes .
speak with assano .
my case is finished and awaiting judgement .
i explained to him that it was a medicine for headaches .
nothing more .
that's all it is .
i said that if there were other things , you knew the consequences .
i'm sorry ... ... that my name has been involved again .
it's not fair for the tour , the team , or for me .
unfortunately , in this sport ... ... if someone rides fast , it's because ... ... they're probably doing this and that .
what should we do about it?
the american , lance armstrong !
right now i ought to be thinking about things like contracts
and sponsors , et cetera .
but i can't handle it right now .
it's a shame , because we're in a situation with the sponsors
where i'm not completely free .
i can't do what i'd like to do .
where's the balance?
how much do i have to sacrifice , myself?
it's the fourth year , now .
i can't keep making so many sacrifices and not get anything out of it .
that doesn't put food on the table .
up to the front , ivan .
now .
i haven't been in the best shape , physically .
i've had headaches .
i don't know exactly what it is .
it can be stress .
it can be so many things .
i've been having headaches ...
no cars can get through here .
this is no good !
they can't be so close behind .
does he want to change bikes?
try adjusting it .
it's sitting like this .
push him .
andrea , do you want to change bikes , or what?
come on , andrea !
no bottle .
why the hell did he go down there first?
the first day is just as intense for me as for the riders .
you'll have to look , yourself .
yeah , yeah .
that was completely wrong .
it would be a good idea to test the bike first .
this has a lot to do with stress .
i know how fast everything can fall apart .
a big accident for csc .
new problems .
do you want to change bikes?
how are we going to be able to win?
this is tour de france .
you don't have a chance if you don't use your head .
jesus .
i can't understand how he dares .
my god , what a sprint !
look at this ...
no !
it was kurt .
fuck !
why didn't you come before?
i was down with sabine .
haven't you taken others , ole?
no .
he's just arrived .
now an hour's gone by .
there are some others who must be looked at .
it's very hard to tell ...
then find another one , ole .
half an hour ago they said he'd come in 2 minutes .
then you'd better find him .
he was three seconds behind .
we've just lost a minute .
if you're not together with the group , you get the real time to armstrong .
so he loses 45 seconds .
a bit more .
that can't be true .
it's in the rules .
he's furious .
we'll have to protest .
if we made a complaint , what would it be based on?
that it's hopeless to make the last 100 meters on cobblestones .
so they should makes exceptions?
yes , i think so .
they're the ones who decided to put the finish line there .
ole , it doesn't matter whether he's four minutes behind , or forty .
do you want a cup of coffee ...?
okay .
you don't want one either , ole?
no .
excuse me ...
ole?
ow , that hurts .
ow !
it's your bile .
that helped a lot .
to be quite honest
there have been ... ... some situations that have been hard for me to tackle .
i've known you for several years .
i think ... ... sometimes it takes so little
to make one feel
that it's good one is here .
try smiling .
but you know me , ole .
i've never seen you like this , bjarne .
i don't know what it is .
i'm just focused .
i'm here to ...
i think many of us take it as though there's something's wrong .
that we're doing something wrong .
no .
i'm glad to hear it .
there isn't .
it means a lot to me to know that what i do is good enough .
otherwise you wouldn't be here .
that's why you're here .
you know that , too .
even though you're stressed ...
just a little ...
do you have so much on your mind?
it's filled up .
then you have to let people know you need help .
that is ...
i know you're used to fighting alone .
but if things are too much ...
a little sign .
then we can help you .
we can't do your work , but at least we feel we're part of something .
you talk about teamwork , right?
you need help , too .
yeah , yeah .
and support .
i'm saying this as a friend .
i'm afraid people feel rejected when you close yourself off like this .
that isn't what you want , of course .
they're ready tomorrow .
they have to be .
we have to win .
there's the first one .
i've re named him .
he's not " the little bird " .
now he's " the little eagle " .
eighteen days .
no , not at the moment .
she's okay now .
she's helping my wife .
when are you coming , poppa?
are you nervous?
peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers .
can you say " ole kaare fli "?
" you are nice and beautiful .
am i nice and beautiful?
yeah , i know .
like a boxer .
it's not easy .
c'est la vie .
you know , " c'est la vie "?
no .
that's life .
it's french , ole .
tour de france isn't the best time to close myself off .
that's fine .
but if i need to sometimes , i should be allowed to .
i just need to be helped out of it again .
i can tell from my eyes that i'm tired .
it's an incredibly hard sport .
perhaps the hardest you can get into .
maybe there are many who have learned how to fight
before they became professional bicycle riders .
i have .
some people can't live up to their expectations and those of others .
they create incalculable burdens for themselves .
there are those who are mentally unable to get a grasp on their lives .
they don't get help at the right time .
they're not good at asking for it .
they can't pull themselves together when it's necessary .
they become losers .
and then sometimes tragic things happen .
it's a damn hard sport .
it requires willpower .
everything can change in a split second .
this can't happen .
i think carlos called .
i think carlos called you .
we can't , right now .
bobby had been looking forward to the tour
and was on his way to a good result
for both himself and the team .
suddenly it's all lying on the asphalt .
i can't ride anymore .
must you ride with that on tomorrow?
i don't want to .
tomorrow you shouldn't .
it's better if it gets air .
it'll create too much wind resistance .
it has a hell of an effect on you .
falling down , time after time .
anyone else would have given up long ago .
it hurts here .
i have pain here .
i have pains in my stomach .
it's not going to be easy today .
i'm completely wrecked .
i can't pedal anymore !
good , jakob !
there's only one thing to do ...
you have to .
what?
you have to .
if you can't ride , you can't ride .
that's all there is to it .
are you going home?
good luck .
give 'em hell .
i'll try .
don't ride too much .
hello .
ivan broke down on the first rest day .
he was told his mother was seriously ill with cancer .
i tried to console him a bit .
we drove back to the hotel .
we agreed to assemble all the riders .
ivan explained the situation .
he intended to continue .
it was very important that they trust each other .
they had to be loyal to him .
it's important that they supported him .
you know what , bjarne?
i've spoken to my mother .
if this is fate , what do i do now?
it's hard not to see my daughter and wife for a month .
i prefer to see my daughter and my mother when i come home .
they say they'll give her chemotherapy so she's not in pain .
but she's getting closer to death every day .
lance isn't dumb .
he's really cunning .
that's why he's won the tour six times .
he's a really good rider .
really excellent .
but he also uses his head .
tactically , he's really clever .
part of it is also a question of psychology .
i spoke with him yesterday .
we had a talk
if you stick with me friday and saturday , you'll end near the top .
why?
he said he was going to win the tour on friday and saturday .
he's convinced he'll leave everyone behind .
he's going to win both stages ...
i know that .
it was important for me to be present .
i let him know that , whatever happens , we're backing him up .
i always write some information about the stage
on my handlebars .
i usually also write down other things .
that day i wanted to win .
i wanted to create something meaningful
for the people who care about me .
there was my family situation in particular .
try to do something for her .
that was the day she was supposed to begin the chemotherapy .
the 3 names are my mother's , my wife's and my daughter's .
this way they're close to me .
ivan's next to armstrong , who's attacking .
what a race .
the first time i attacked , it was to split the field
and to see who could keep such a fast pace up the mountain .
armstrong has fallen back .
ivan's broken away with mancebo .
there have been many important moments .
but the important thing here was that i had it all in my head .
i wasn't very afraid
because i knew that bjarne would help me .
at one point i saw a tv where there were three men in front .
my two boys , ivan and carlos , with lance in the middle .
it was a great feeling .
really great .
i was very proud .
stay on his wheel .
stay on his wheel , ivan .
ride , ivan , ride .
good !
come on , ivan !
come on , ivan .
let's go , basso .
show us what you can do .
armstrong and basso ...
i think it was the greatest moment of my career .
good , good , good !
that was amazing .
he didn't even look tired .
may i borrow your telephone?
call my wife and tell her ivan won .
ivan won .
armstrong came in second .
hello , mom .
it's me .
are you alone?
perfect ...
perfect .
good , good ...
hi .
thank you .
that was beautiful .
congratulations .
and to you , too .
i'm happy for ivan .
very happy .
because he tried a lot .
i saw him ...
i asked him because i saw he was really good .
he was in the right position .
so i tried .
the others , like tyler hamilton , were finished .
what do you say , bjarne?
fantastic .
that was lucky .
now you don't need rubber bands .
are you happy , ivan?
yes .
we've got a chance if we keep on like this .
it went great , of course .
but it sure as hell wasn't easy .
i could see that right away .
well , but ...
you were tenacious .
yes , i'm satisfied .
we handled things well .
i've spoken with one of armstrong's friends .
he gave me a number .
what did lance say?
he was glad you were there .
because ... ... everyone knows it was an important day for you .
everyone knows that .
yes , yes .
he's letting armstrong win .
he can't do that .
he won yesterday , you know .
we have to be careful not to accept lance's terms .
if we're going to beat lance , it has to be on our own terms .
if he can imprint in ivan's mind how he should ride
we won't beat him .
he's had it a little too easy .
fifteen and a half kilometers long .
this is how it looks .
i don't think about anything .
i ride as i've been doing the past 5 days .
it's total chaos .
people running in front of the riders , hitting cars .
there are no barricades .
he promised to divide it up in two kilometers .
go , carlos !
go , go , go !
shout to the motorcycle .
you'll catch him in ten minutes .
motorcycle !
i was afraid someone would step out in front of me .
what a bunch of idiots !
this is unbelievable !
motorcycle !
armstrong's right there .
ride through , ivan , ride !
armstrong's on his way , ivan .
remember your breathing .
go , ivan .
it's not over yet !
it's not over yet .
ride !
i feel like jumping onto ivan's bike and pedaling like hell .
give him a push .
do whatever i can .
at the same time , i'm really impressed .
it looks really great when he comes whizzing by .
anything can happen .
it takes so little to change the whole situation .
i don't think he expected to catch ivan .
he'd expected ivan to give him a run for his money .
so did l .
and that's what ivan does , when he's giving it all he's got .
i think he was a little surprised to see us so soon .
maybe he was relieved to see ivan go down
because he knew he was dangerous .
ivan was the one he had to watch out for .
come on , ivan .
stay there !
stay behind him !
don't be afraid !
ride , now .
ride , ride , ride !
i thought i could win the tour
until the night before .
it doesn't matter , ivan .
it's all right .
i don't feel well .
things can only get better .
do you know what times jens , peter and bobby had?
in relation to basso , so we can compare .
what was carlos 'time?
we were lacking what was there the other days .
it wasn't a great day .
no .
i expected to ride better .
but i wasn't that bad .
it didn't go too well .
hi .
come over here .
you were noisy last saturday .
daddy's leg hurts .
can't you stroke my leg?
no , mine .
can you stroke daddy's leg?
stroke it .
it hurts a lot .
show what daddy does when he wins .
if it's ever going to happen ... it'll take years .
i'm in good physical shape .
i can feel the motor , but the rest ...
don't think about it now .
i feel bad .
not so much for myself , but for the rest of you .
for myself ...
michele ...
i know you haven't achieved what you set out to do .
life's not over when your career's over .
that's when life begins .
what should i do after my career's finished?
i'd like you all to think it over a bit .
it's not enough that i'm the only one who knows this philosophy .
when you're with some people more than those you really care about ... ... it's a huge privation .
it's not reasonable , somehow .
how long can you take it?
you can only take it so long as what you're doing is fun ... ... and it draws a response .
something has to make it worth it .
otherwise it's completely impossible .
you start thinking negatively .
it puts you somewhere else then where you should be .
alessandra has given me invaluable support .
i've always felt she's been very close to me throughout my career .
she's never let me down .
not even for a week .
she has always given me moral support .
she didn't pay as much attention to me when my daughter was born .
of course .
there's never been a victory that has made me as happy
as when my daughter was born .
there's no comparison .
naturally , all my victories
bring out many feelings in me .
but it can't be compared with my family at all .
i haven't spoken much with you yet .
but i want you to know the team means a lot to me .
of course it's not the same for you .
because it's your team .
so it means a lot to me .
but once in a while you have to ...
don't talk so much .
i don't know you so well .
you have a strong character .
it's not so easy to sit and talk about .
you can tell me everything .
with no exceptions .
i know you'd like to go home .
you just have to say it .
you can trust me .
i trust you .
i always knew i was able to win .
in a different way .
some thought it was beautiful .
others have criticized it .
i've always tried to do something different .
win in a different way .
maybe i've also lost some races in this way .
at the moment i prefer
to live my life without thinking to much about
how things could have been .
it's all right to live and take one day at a time .
but of course the good thoughts blend in with the bad .
the good moments are what's left .
the victories ... ... togetherness ...
i was hoping for a good result .
of course .
but there'll be other races .
don't say that .
but , still ...
it'll be all right .
during the race i didn't feel anything .
but when they started riding hard ... ...
i lacked that extra something .
it also had to do with being nervous .
getting results .
you shouldn't think so much about it .
bye , we'll talk later .
okay .
bye .
the fate of the team depends a lot on me .
of course it does .
is it dangerous that they're extras in my little show?
that's also something to think about .
i going to get drunk tonight .
my wallet ...
where the hell did i leave it?
there are many things i have learn to do better .
i have to be better at giving compliments .
it's something ... ...
i want to have more energy to do .
this is something you have to train yourself to do .
train yourself to be a better man and a better father .
but you need the time and have to make priorities .
i don't think i've been good enough at this .
but ... it's something i have to work on .
what we have now can't be taken from us .
we should just be proud .
what does daddy do when he wins?
that asshole !
was it nice?
yes .
one day it'll be me standing on that top step .
it was good ... ... but in our own way , right?
no ... 65 .
it's 64 .
and you?
62 .
you liar .
how tall are you then?
