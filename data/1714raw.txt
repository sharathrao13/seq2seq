dear mom , get well soon
tell the head nurse to stay .
ryoko , ryoko ...
ryoko , ryoko ...
hello !
i'm sorry .
5 : 28 pm .
i brought this for mom .
7 years later
hey , let's go home .
the waves are too high .
dad , no luck again?
you don't understand .
i'm only after the big ones .
i prefer real life girls to imaginary big fish .
well ...
when you grow up , you'll understand .
it's called romanticism .
hello .
i have done the planning .
i'll bring it tomorrow .
yes ...
hello?
sorry i have to go .
this is too big for us .
we'll share it with rie .
you don't bring friends home anymore .
is everything ok?
did you know that black sea bream originate as males?
what?
when they reach 15 cm long , they become unisex .
then some become female .
oh really?
what about this one?
we saw ovaries .
did we?
i don't know very much about ovaries .
you don't look young anymore .
what?
you look very plain .
gang .
hey , dad , why don't you get remarried?
why do you say that?
i just simply think so .
thanks for the dinner .
it's your turn for the dishes .
it looks like a ceremony for a religious cult .
they're pretty much the same .
lonely .
happy people wouldn't go to that kind of concert .
the whole of japan is lonely .
are you?
you too , right?
boss .
mr. ueno wants to change tomorrow's meeting from 1 : 00 to 3 : 30 pm .
that's okay by me .
i'll be here .
i'll drop in at starts and then meet yoshikawa tonight .
i won't be back at the office .
any changes and i'll call you on your cell phone .
yeah .
well ...
i'm going to marry soon .
really?
congratulations .
to whom?
someone you don't know .
congratulations anyway .
you're a busy man .
it's all right , but ...
the profit margins are getting thinner .
how about you?
don't you know?
the movie industry is profitable .
really?
i'm lying .
it's like a survival game , or a game of torture .
is it no good?
seems like a bright future ahead .
but i don't know how long we can hang in there .
yoshikawa .
didn't you say the same thing a year ago?
did i?
awful girls .
no class and stuck up .
stupid as well .
where are all the good girls?
japan is finished .
let me say ...
i intend to get married again .
well , what made you decide to do that?
who's she?
i haven't found her yet .
my son said to me that i look old and that i should get married again .
that's the story .
you look old ...
how are you going to look for one?
an arranged marriage?
no , that's not my style .
i wish there was a very nice woman hiding somewhere .
what is your ideal woman like?
preferably young?
not too young .
she could possibly have a job , and some training .
training?
for instance , playing the piano , singing or dancing .
your ex wife ryoko was like that .
certain training gives people confidence .
a lack of confidence brings unhappiness .
pianist .
it'll cost you more .
she need not necessarily be a professional .
i don't want to fail at marriage at my age .
i'd like to have enough time to observe her .
i'd like to see many women and then choose my ideal one .
what are you laughing at?
am i expecting too much?
i probably am .
no , i can handle that .
i have an idea .
have an audition .
it'll be a romantic story .
remember your documentary?
love triangle between dancer , patron and a down syndrome boy .
teamed up with a german tv station .
i'll rearrange the story .
any problems?
i don't see any problems , but we're going to audition?
trust me .
have i ever disappointed you?
well no , but ...
the heroine is supposed to be in her early 20's to 30 .
the conditions are that she be a well trained person .
no problems , huh?
wouldn't it be fraudulent?
this audition is not only about finding you a wife .
it's part of making a movie .
collect enough money , we have the movie .
the story isn't bad .
well ...
am i supposed to marry the main girl?
no , a girl with that much talent wouldn't marry you .
they aren't the marrying type .
really good ones will always fail the second interview .
really?
they are quite attractive .
smart , with a good upbringing .
traditional and well trained .
wishing her to be your son's wife?
i don't get it .
why can't she get the main part?
they are not unhappy .
happy people can't act well .
and another thing .
i have a plan to work with fm , i'll combine this .
make another program called " tomorrow's heroine " .
trust me .
i'm a pro at auditions .
this is yoshikawa .
i'm in room number 2 .
coffee?
is coffee ok for you?
bring two coffees please .
i'm in a middle of a traffic jam , i might be late ...
please hand that tape to mr. kaneda .
thanks .
tomorrow's heroine .
i'm just wondering where you are?
wonderful things might happen .
if you encourage yourself a little bit more .
every star has their defining moment .
hepburn and julia roberts .
they led their own lives prior to becoming heroines .
tomorrow's heroine is living at the same time as you are .
no , tomorrow's heroine could be you yourself .
i'm home .
here we go .
you're home early .
that's right , i've got to work at home tonight .
please heat up your dinner .
the bigger dish is for shigehiko .
thanks .
see you on monday .
my daughter's here this weekend .
i've got to go shopping .
that's nice .
hey gang .
please put your washing in the basket .
good bye .
thanks .
bye .
hello .
it's me .
yoshikawa .
i'm checking the applications .
they're all good , right?
i don't know what i'm supposed to do .
it's like buying my first car .
don't mix your car and wife .
i intend to hold the audition next week .
choose 30 applicants .
30 applicants?
that's right .
alright .
i'll let you know .
don't trust pictures .
composition can be more useful .
understood .
see you .
bye .
choose 30 from all of you?
you're home?
why don't you knock at the door?
you just arrived?
yeah .
dinner?
i'll eat later .
why don't you eat first?
alright .
i'm having a guest tonight .
girlfriend?
give her my dinner .
thank you .
what did i do !
asami yamazaki .
classical ballet for 12 years .
i'm not sure that i can make an actress of myself .
and you probably won't choose me .
i was simply attracted to this story .
i studied ballet , but damaged my hips when i was 18 .
i was devastated as i intended to practice in london .
ballet was my priority .
so my dream collapsed .
it might sound exaggerated , but it's like accepting death .
living is another way of reaching death .
i think i know these facts very well .
that's why i applied for this part .
when was this dinosaur living?
about the later cretaceous period .
the later part of cretaceous means ...
that's a sauropod , right?
good .
what about the dinosaur that has the syracuse model?
i don't know .
do you want to see?
hi !
good evening .
good evening .
i'm his father .
my name is misuzu .
nice to meet you .
nice to meet you too .
i often see her on the train .
i thought she was pretty , so i talked to her .
good job .
i'm interested in biology .
he showed me his books .
we ate your dinner .
fine .
was it his?
i'm sorry i ate your meal .
terribly sorry .
i will cook something for you .
don't worry about it .
take it easy .
gang .
good boy .
let's go for a walk .
shigehiko , make sure she gets home alright .
of course .
ok boy , come on .
let's go , gang .
ready?
well ...
i feel like a criminal .
i'm ready .
let's start .
pleased to meet you .
please sit .
my name is yu tanaka .
please have a seat .
are you nervous?
a little bit .
sorry , you are the first one .
that's ok .
we're going to tape you .
but don't worry .
do you mind if i ask what your father's job is?
well ... my father's ... job is ...
what can i say?
next one .
i'm going to ask you frankly .
why did you apply for this part?
have you ever had sex with someone you don't like?
are you interested in drugs?
can you act a little bit for us?
sure .
go ahead .
what music do you like?
which actress do you like?
i like mituko mori .
next .
i used to love sports .
at school , i played ...
did you ever want to work for the sex industry?
i have a friend who is working in that area .
next .
what are men to you?
have you ever seen tarkovsky's films?
ren osugi .
we have some sex scenes .
can you handle that?
no problem .
are you psychic?
next .
may i ask you a question?
can you smile?
what kind of men don't you like?
yoko sugimura .
nice to meet you .
if i didn't have confidence i wouldn't be an actress .
excuse me .
when i was 2 , mother decided that i'd be an actress .
can you walk around the chair?
turn around .
next please .
nice meeting you .
it's time for a break from our schedule .
we're 30 minutes late .
let's take a 10 minute break .
sure .
you don't seem too enthusiastic .
don't tell me you're not interested anymore .
it's not like that .
then what?
i'm nervous myself .
i need to use the toilet .
i lived in paris for 3 years .
and have come back to tokyo as a designer .
i can't think about anything else but being an actress .
my office was only for adult videos .
keep her for another job .
i'm not satisfied being called a cover girl queen .
this scar is from my first suicide attempt and this is from the second .
i've been to an asylum 3 times .
next .
emi kitani .
pleased to meet you .
we finished your interview before .
but i haven't finished what i have to say .
you have a nice career , why do you want to be an actress?
i think i've been doing very well , but ...
sorry .
i'm a children's nurse .
my work is very hard ...
next please .
ms. asami yamazaki .
please .
asami yamazaki .
have a seat .
sorry for the delay .
it's ok .
have you done any movies or tv jobs?
i've had many opportunities , but actually haven't done any .
do you belong to any agency?
not really .
but i'm on keep for a record company director .
but we haven't contacted each other recently .
which record company?
ace records .
could you tell me your personal contact's name?
japanese music dept .
director shibata .
since you quit your previous job , you're unemployed?
how do you manage your daily expenses?
if you don't mind telling us .
i help at a friend's shop .
3 times a week .
what kind of shop?
a small bar in ginza .
the owner used to be a class mate in voice training .
if i keep my costs low , i have no money problems .
don't you want to lead a luxurious life?
too poor isn't good .
but i can afford books and cds .
that's enough for me .
can i ask you about ballet?
certainly .
you damaged your hips .
that's correct .
it must have been awful to quit what you'd been doing .
yes .
i must sound a bit rude but ...
your writing says that quitting what you liked ... ... is almost similar to accepting death .
i was highly impressed .
i think everybody has similar experiences .
in your lifetime when you have something beyond your control .
what can you do but accept it?
i think that's life .
i mean ...
i was amazed a young girl like you understands that .
i think you live your life in a very thoughtful way .
that's what i thought .
thank you very much .
are you finished?
thank you for coming .
we may contact you later .
yes .
excuse me .
may i call the next one?
let's have a 15 minute break .
fine .
please tell mr. ito i'll be late .
what do you think?
she made me very nervous .
i wanted a cigarette .
you decided on her before the audition .
i like her much more than her nice writing .
i think you live your life in a very thoughtful way .
it's not an interviewer's comment .
i was stunned .
don't joke about that .
she really impressed me .
i'm sure she's a serious type of girl .
she is better than her photo and may also be good hearted .
but i don't like her .
what's wrong with her?
something chemical .
can't say exactly what's wrong .
i just don't like her .
your girlfriend seemed nice .
misuzu?
she looked nice , but ...
what?
one of those girl things .
i don't understand girls .
don't you?
thanks .
hey , dad , about your remarriage .
preferably someone who cooks better than rie .
why are you in such a hurry?
new discovery of another dinosaur , from argentina .
that one could be older than euraptile .
really .
i'll be busy collecting information .
take a bath .
yes , hello .
sorry for calling so late .
this is producer aoyama .
i interviewed you today .
thank you for your time today .
not at all .
well ...
i wondered if you might have some time to talk with me .
of course .
i'd love to see you .
when would be good for you?
anytime would be fine , during the daytime .
really .
let me see .
for instance ...
good night .
this is the aoyama residence .
it's me .
how is it?
about ms. yamazaki .
not that i doubted her , i called ace records .
it's no big deal , but something didn't seem right .
what is it?
director shibata isn't at the company .
to be precise , he isn't there anymore .
he's been missing for a year .
he just disappeared .
i'm nervous .
please relax , i won't ask you any special questions .
you only ask of me to enjoy this nice food and talk?
absolutely .
that's the best request i've ever had .
just one question .
your director contact .
mr. shibata?
i'm sorry i said so at the audition , but ...
in fact i've never met him .
i don't belong to any actors 'agency .
i was advised to answer you like that .
is that so?
i didn't mean to tell a lie .
it's ok .
i've clarified that question , that's no problem .
here we go .
looks wonderful .
go ahead .
yummy .
good .
i hope i'm not asking you too much , and ...
you probably can't , but ...
if you have some free time ...
i'd like to talk to you more .
i don't have anybody to be frank with .
if i'm good enough , i'd love to .
really?
i'm very happy about that .
i'll try not to bother you .
i don't mind any place .
even on the telephone would be fine .
i'll write my cellular phone number on my business card .
please call me anytime .
thank you very much .
thank you for the meal too .
i've decided .
i don't care about the movie , i'm interested only in her .
don't worry about the movie .
i'll handle that matter .
but don't be too hasty .
you wanted to have some time to observe your prospect .
why are you so negative about her?
what's wrong with her?
i only think that life isn't so easy .
she is beautiful , classy and obedient .
such a woman not having any boyfriends is unthinkable .
i checked out her associates , none are accessible .
the bar she was talking about is also an unknown .
we can't reach anybody who knows her .
i wasn't born yesterday .
i won't be fooled that easily .
i trust myself over some other's evaluation .
if there's any trouble , i can solve it .
ok .
you said i could find my ideal woman from an audition .
i appreciate it .
hey , aoyama .
promise me one thing .
don't call her .
hopefully i'm wrong about this , but ...
it's going to affect your whole life .
don't be so hasty .
cool down a bit .
alright .
i promise you .
you're not sick , are you?
it is rare for you to take a day off .
since i've worked for you , i've never seen you like this .
oh well ...
it's good to have a break .
you might be a little tired .
since your wife died , you've worked very hard for your son .
forming your own company , which is doing quite well .
you work too much .
i wish my husband was like you .
my life would be easier .
you must have a nice girlfriend .
i'm sure you do .
men can't maintain without female support .
i've finished .
i'm going home .
bye .
see you tomorrow .
i'm leaving .
see you .
oh?
what is it?
not really .
see you tomorrow .
bye .
this is aoyama .
really?
good .
i thought you wouldn't phone me anymore .
if i told the truth , you might think that i'm a heavy woman .
i've been longing for your call .
sorry .
so how are you?
what?
what's so funny?
i never thought about having a date with you again .
so i'm pretty excited .
here we go .
i never asked you about your family .
are they fine?
they're fine .
you're from tokyo , right?
they bought a house in chiba .
just moved in last month .
my father loves golf , living in chiba is more convenient .
really?
we are not that close .
but not that distant either .
quite an average family .
do you still work at the bar?
yes .
is that in ginza?
it's on 4th street .
called the stone fish .
funny name .
the stone fish?
shall i come for a drink?
thank you ... but ... ... the owner interferes with my private things .
if you don't want me to come of course i won't .
i'm just curious about you .
i won't lie to you , definitely not .
i promise .
i have to tell you ...
can i tell you the truth about the movie?
someone else got the part?
it's not like that .
the movie itself .
actually the sponsor didn't like some of the story .
we had to suspend it .
in the worst case it might not come out .
oh really?
you might be hurt .
not me .
but you might be .
you read my composition , didn't you?
i never thought i'd get the main part .
it's ok .
the good thing is that i met you .
i felt wonderful seeing myself in the mirror .
joining images of myself and beautiful things .
that's incredible , i trained myself hard to release pain .
that's why i could tolerate hard lessons .
but eventually i lost my precious ballet .
it's hard to forget about it .
but someday you'll feel that life is wonderful .
that's life , isn't it?
thank you .
living alone is a hassle .
i have nobody to talk with .
there were some guys that approached me .
but you are the first one to support me .
warmly wrapping me and trying to understand me .
let's have dinner soon .
when will that be?
sorry .
am i pushing you?
i'll call you .
yes , i'll wait for you .
here is fine .
please stop the car .
she's getting off .
thank you very much for today .
see you .
good night .
bye .
take me to okusawa .
yes?
can i talk to you for a moment?
what?
well well , the drapes are dirty .
what?
well ...
you found a girlfriend .
am i right?
bingo .
you look a little different , sometimes you even smile .
she is only 24 years old .
she's closer to my age .
must be very beautiful .
i'm the same as you .
i like the beautiful ones .
don't get fooled .
i'm much cleverer than you .
have you proposed to her?
not yet .
we are going away this weekend .
i'm going to propose to her then .
good luck !
i'll introduce her to you soon .
let me check her out first .
i trust my hunches .
because you're blind in love now .
well , what can we do before dinner?
i know the chef here is very good .
he provides very nice food .
but he has a terrible mouth .
there is a little museum close by .
if we leave now , we could still make it .
it's about 20 minutes by car .
after that , we could go to the harbour .
it's a little harbour , but it has a nice coffee shop .
they serve nice cheesecake .
their desserts are ...
come to me .
please .
don't take off your clothes yet .
please ...
look at my body .
i burnt myself when i was little .
i want you to know all about me .
you are very beautiful .
please love me .
only me .
i understand .
everybody says so .
but i hope you are different from the others .
only me .
ok?
only me .
please love me .
only me .
yes .
is that mr. aoyama?
this is the front desk .
yes .
i'm terribly sorry .
you must be in bed .
we tried calling many times but there was no answer .
your partner has left .
we want to confirm your stay .
sorry to call you so late , but we need to know .
left?
what you are saying is she disappeared?
nobody answers the phone .
there's no way to contact her .
i don't know exactly where she lives either .
what happened in the hotel?
i told you all about it .
but normally people don't disappear like that .
we might have misunderstood each other somehow .
i just want to talk to her face to face .
yoshikawa , can you find out her address?
aoyama , i've only got her resume .
it's impossible .
why don't you forget about her .
i can't do that .
i can't finish everything like this .
i know i can't convince you but ...
i suggest you forget about her .
you're saying ... ... that i ... ... went too crazy about a young girl .
eventually being left alone like a pathetic old fart?
yes , you are .
what's the matter with you?
you said that you weren't born yesterday .
whatever problems come up , you fix them , right?
oh come on !
what?
it's ok .
what's ok about it?
it's ok now .
i won't ask your help anymore .
i'll look for her .
i'll look for her myself .
aoyama !
shimada ballet studio
excuse me?
excuse me , but ...
excuse me .
are you ...
are you mr. shimada?
i'm the one who called you this afternoon .
about miss asami yamazaki .
go home .
let me be frank with you .
did you have any problems with asami before?
i just want to know how to contact her .
and i'm looking for a clue .
did you see her?
yes .
did you hear her voice?
what do you mean by that?
did you touch her body?
did you hold her in your arms?
how was that?
was it good?
did you smell her?
asami ...
go home .
4th street .
the stone fish .
the stone fish
no one is there .
are you closed today?
that bar closed about a year ago .
that was huge mess .
the owner was murdered .
do you know an asami who used to work here?
asami?
i don't recall .
normally the owner worked here alone .
asami was supposed to be working here 3 times a week .
some kind of a mistake .
excuse me ...
why was the owner killed?
i'm not sure but people talked about some sort of man problem .
she used to be associated with a music industry guy .
she used drugs too .
did she get murdered here?
the body was chopped up completely .
it's a 28 year old building .
the whole thing is tilted .
we saw her blood flowing through a gap in the door .
the other mystery was ...
the police tried to recompose her body together .
3 extra fingers and an ear came up .
an extra tongue as well .
isn't it a terrible world?
meal time , gang .
bye .
hi , this is shigehiko .
i'm going to stay at my friend's house tonight .
it's none of my business , but eat properly .
there's some yogurt there , please have it .
and gang was hiding .
underneath the house , please feed him .
talk to you later .
i'm sorry .
how have you been?
i never expected we would meet again .
sorry to be childish .
i never asked you about your family .
are they fine?
when i was little , my parents got a divorce .
i was sent to my uncle's house .
that was a terrible place .
i only remember being abused .
my uncle's wife was that sort of woman .
i have many scars .
if it's too painful , you needn't talk about .
no , i want you to know all about me .
i was forced into cold baths in winter , and i got pneumonia .
she pushed me down the staircase .
i broke my shoulder bone .
the doctor worried about me .
he sent me back to my mother's home .
when was that?
i was 7 years old .
really .
my mother had remarried .
i've reduced the scars .
but my stepfather ...
hated me so much .
he's got disabled legs .
staying at home all the time .
i did nothing in a dark room everyday .
until my mother came home .
i'm sorry .
it's not a normal story is it?
if you dislike me , please say so .
strange .
i never imagined you'd had such an agonizing past .
because ballet supported me .
you had talent .
i'm not sure .
but when i danced , it purified the dark side of me .
that's the reason why i never tried to kill myself .
i think ... you're wonderful .
i've been looking for someone like you .
darling .
ryoko .
this is an opportune time .
let me introduce you .
this is asami .
no ...
she isn't good for you .
she's a very fine woman .
no ... darling , no .
i want ...
i want you right now .
asami .
that was a little mistake .
you made love to me .
only once .
i expected something from you .
was i stupid?
sorry .
forgive me .
i'll do anything to give you pleasure .
i like doing this .
what are you doing !
stop it .
look , you've got a hard on .
stop it !
3 extra fingers , an ear ... ... and a tongue too .
you only love me .
only me .
asami .
asami .
dance for me .
dance .
dance .
dance , bitch !
dance ... ... for me otherwise ... ... i'll torture you !
dance .
please .
dance for me .
dance !
asami ...
good girl .
asami !
this wire can ... ... cut meat and bone very easily .
you are wonderful .
i never felt unhappy .
because i've been unhappy all the time .
asami !
please stop !
no !
males need female support .
otherwise they can't maintain .
let's have an audition .
my son told me that i look old .
why don't i remarry .
that's why i decided .
asami ...
you ...
you can't move any more .
i've paralyzed your body but your nerves are still awake .
you can enjoy the pain and suffer incredibly .
you guys collect many girls from auditions .
make them fail .
you contact them later .
just wanting to have sex .
everybody is the same .
deeper , deeper ...
deeper , deeper ...
painful?
words create lies .
pain can be trusted .
right?
you can feel pain .
you can study about the human body as well .
deeper ...
this is the most painful point .
am i right?
then here too .
here as well .
right?
deeper , deeper ...
deeper , deeper ...
deeper , deeper ...
here we go .
underneath the eyes is also very painful .
you only realize what kind of man you are ... ... when you feel pain , you understand .
when you have a very agonizing experience .
your son is called shigehiko , right?
your son has to suffer pain , then you'll understand more .
stop that !
stay away from my son .
you love your son , too?
you're a liar .
you only love me , right?
i've only got you .
but you have so many others .
i don't want to be one of them .
even if i give you all of me , you won't be mine completely .
everybody is the same .
everybody .
everybody .
you can't go anywhere without feet .
this wire can cut meat and bone easily .
stop it !
right foot , please .
i'm home .
dad , are you awake?
my friend got sick all of a sudden .
so we called an ambulance .
are you there?
what happened , dad?
what's going on?
what happened?
are you ok?
well ...
i will ...
i'll answer your proposal .
what?
your proposal ...
i accept .
proposal?
it's like a dream .
i'm so happy .
i applied for the audition .
i was the ...
... luckiest one .
because i didn't become the heroine of the movie .
but i became the real heroine .
deeper , deeper ...
what's wrong , dad?
who the hell are you?
what the hell do you want?
what's going on?
dad !
are you alright , dad?
dad !
call the police ...
police ...
is this the police?
this is the aoyama residence , okusawa .
please send an ambulance .
my father's been seriously injured .
and one woman too .
i don't know the details .
his left leg has been chopped off and is bleeding badly .
the address is okusawa 6 20 4 .
i thought you were very busy .
i don't know your job so well .
i might sound heavy .
but i've been waiting for your call for a long time .
i never expected that we would meet again .
sorry to have been childish .
it's a hassle living alone .
i didn't have anybody to talk with .
you are the first one to support me ...
warmly wrapping me ...
trying to understand me ...
it's hard to forget about .
but someday you'll feel ... ... that life is wonderful .
that's life , isn't it?
