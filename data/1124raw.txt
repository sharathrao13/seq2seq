why?
to be world champion , of course !
first i'll get on a pro team in germany ...
then why are you skipping practice?

tsujido academy

i wish i'd gone to sweden or germany .
come on !
don't forget they hired you to beat kazama .
somebody's a chopper .
against a quick attacker .
the chopper's playing to lose .
why?
i don't know .
japanese modesty?
let's go inside .
i can't hear in all this wind
i'll take that .
yes !
keep playing to lose , four eyes ... ... and it'll get to be a habit .
china !
you're giving him all his shots .

kamikaze !

you always cry when you lose .
what are you looking at? !

losing 21 0 .
peco got skunked !
skunked !

skunked !
i wish i'd never been born .
he's one of shanghai's top juniors .
who do you think you are?
i've shamed japan !
i want to die !

here and now !
yen1, 000 fine for climbing on a table .
yuck !
granny panties !
yen2, 000 !

no , i don't .
wow !
you don't even realize it !
ok ... starting tomorrow you come here at 5 a . m .
we'll do two months 'special training 'for the inter high tournament .
it's like we'll be married .
one , two ... ... three , four ... ... five , six ... legs and arms !
hey !
mr tsukimoto !
i knew you'd come !
i was wrong , coach .
you were wrong?
don't worry about it !
let's get to work .
yes , coach .
let's go !
ready , tsukimoto?
you poor old bastard !
isn't this fun?
change the line !
attack !
make your own chances !
hey , skinhead ... is he always like this before a tournament?
who are you calling 'skinhead '? !
he's mad about this morning .
recognize and react !
recognizing takes a tenth of a second !
then you react !
bring that time as close to zero as you can !
no other sport demands the reaction time of table tennis !
tsukimoto's getting pissed off .
coach keeps stepping on the balls !
there's another one !
what is this?
a hot spring?
shape up or ship out !
he's pissed off .
another ball !
what's wrong?
i'm shipping out .
we just started !
real hot , ain't it?
why are you following me?
you're going to beat china , right?
hell , yeah !
so you can't skip practice any more .
practice like that?
it's a total waste of time .
i've been really tired lately .
of what?
tabe tennis relationships ...
life's getting too complicated .
i'm a simple guy .
all i want is to be the best table tennis player ... ... on the planet !
winning's everything , right?
no , it isn't .
no?
i don't like dragging someone down just to win a game .
that's the cool part .
for me , ping pong is only killing time .
not for me .
yeah , but you're cool .
i don't like it when you look bad .
then let's go back .
i can't practice without you .
i'll buy you a popsicle .
hurry up , smile !
run !
hey !
popsicles !
welcome to the 2000 inter high prefectural preliminary ... ... men's table tennis tournament .
i have to play those losers?
i wish i was dead !
i don't see the guy with the glasses .
kaio !
look out !
who'd you draw?
china , in the third game .
that sucks , dude .
rest in peace .
what about you?
i drew ...
... 'that ', in the third game .
demon?
well , if it isn't peco !
you're such a shrimp i almost didn't see you .
maybe a certain bald guy needs better glasses , huh?
does your shit school put frosh on the varsity squad?
better than picking up balls for three years at a name school .
dumb ass !
i'm on the varsity !
sakuma !
team meeting !
right !
later , peco .
have your hanky out .
what?
for when you start crying .
i'll put a ball right through those glasses , asshole !
i'm going to skunk you , demon !
there he is !
you happy now?
where's mr kazama?
he always shuts himself in the can before a match .
diarrhea?
no .
one day you'll understand .
game , set !
hoshino , katase high school .
thank you , thank you ...
shut up , stupid it's only the first game !
what does he think he's doing?
kong , baby !
show us some kung fu !
hey , china !
china !
china !
hey , fortune cookie !
silence !
to hear you speak ill of him ... ... is repellent .
he's pissed off .
who the hell do you think you are , egghead? !
cool it !
huh?
huh?
just shut up !
the kaio team is having its meeting , mr kazama .
i want to talk to you .
do you mind?
i'm going !
wait !
i met your mother at an inter high tournament !
he represented aomori and i represented ehime !
table tennis is in your blood !
i won't stand by and let you quit !
let go of me !
so what if he's chinese?
some black people can't dance .
what?
is that true?
yeah !
and some germans don't like beer !
your father's from aomori but he hates apples !
yeah !
shanghai schmanghai !
he'll fall down , go boom !
fall down go boom !
fall down go boom !
fall down go boom !
yes !
how childish !
he didn't make china's national team ... ... so he's trying to start over in japan .
i hate to think how that'd feel .
but he shouldn't show up someone in front of everybody like that .
how will that guy feel?
you play your best out of respect for your opponent .
tsukimoto ... ... i hate the way you play ... ... going easy on people out of consideration for them .
it's patronizing .
if you want to make me mad , you're succeeding .
you're not fit to hold a racket .
i hate you .
it's almost time ...
i'm coming .
where's the old glass bottle?
yen200 for this is a rip off !
huh? !
hey , did you shake this? !
there's yen100 gone already !
this sucks !
feel the heat !
game , set .
tsukimoto , katase high school .
you were attacking ...
just for a change .
play your own style .
why?
i just do this to kill time .
what's wrong with that?
i don't like this play as if it meant your life shit .
you sure sound relaxed .
is that why you weren't chopping?
is that a problem?
maybe .
i'm the guy who plays the attacking game .
oh yeah?
anyway , it's not smart to keep changing your game .
are you ok?
about what?
demon .
he's like a different guy from the old days .
don't you worry bout me .
hey , peco ... ... do you believe in heroes?
heroes?
someone who comes to help when you're in trouble .
they only exist ...
... in comic books .
maybe so .
take this and play to win .
this is my spare .
i changed the rubber .
long pips ...
why bother?
i'm playing kong .
yes .
not hoshino .
so do me a favor , and don't hold back .
i don't need this !
why are you always on my case?
leave me alone !
mr tsukimoto ... ... let's make a bet .
you win your match and i get off your back .
and if i lose?
lose and you're my dog .
you do everything i say .
there are things you can only see from the very top ... ... mr tsukimoto .
and you've been there?
nothing's going to change for me , win or lose .
i'm not betting .
you'll lose .
thanks , 'coach '.
i'm telling the truth .
you're going to lose .
sure you don't want to bet , mr tsukimoto?
if i win , don't try coaching me ever again .
round 3 !
round 3 !
kong , tsujido academy , and tsukimoto , katase high school .
i want to hear you guys !
the loudest side wins !
if tsujido outshouts us we lose !
go , go , tsukimoto !
push , push , tsukimoto !
shut up !
this is my game .
there's no point shouting .
what?
it's irritating .
dismissed !
yes !
that's the best you can do?
you've got talent ... ... but you never develop it ...
... here .
yes !
yes !
game !
tsujido , kong !
i knew we should be shouting .
we can't outshout china .
there's a billions of them .
second game !
tsukimoto to serve .
love all .
yes !
china was off guard .
he's reading you !
keep quiet , will you?
now we'll see the real smile .
now we'll see the real smile .
could we get him into our school?
china?
no .
your old buddy .
smile?
'smile '?
they call him that because he never does .
you're really into this .
it's half jealousy .
lots of people want real talent ... ... but very few have it .
real talent?
shit !
it's over , wenge !
lose this and you're finished !
ignore him .
you're not here as a tourist !
they left you off the team , remember?
this is no time for attitude !
do you hear me?
yes .
peco ...
he's still too nice for his own good !
game , set !
kong , tsujido academy .
playing like that is an insult to the game .
don't do it again !
don't hit someone with glasses on .
don't you know that?
either come to play or quit !
alright .
smile isn't going to bring you back your youth ... ... 'butterfly joe '.
tamura ...
round 3 sakuma of kaio academy ... ... and hoshino , katase high school .
four years , three months since the last time .
24 wins ...
yeah , whatever . ... and 94 losses .
soon it'll be 95 .
peco ...
that's mr peco .
you can't imagine how long i've waited for this day .
i don't want to hear it !
the local hero?
hand on table .
15 12 .
what's all this blocking bullshit?
that's what's happening , 'hero '.
up yours !
first game .
kong serving , love all .
let's get this over with or we'll miss mr kazama .
goodbye , junk food junky !
game , set !
sakuma , kaio academy .
i'll give you a tip .
you know how you stop losing?
by winning .
work harder or quit , punk .
shit !
game , set !
kazama , kaio academy .
you staying here?
peco?
i'll go on ahead .
'my blood tastes of iron . '
move it !
faster !
move it !

we're leaving , coach .
he's a machine !
here they call me 'poco '.
you can call me that , too .
you're all messed up , kid .
we said move .
but if i win , you call me 'mr '.
call me mr poco .
owww !
i read your 'comment '.
kazama wins second title as kaio team upset
'the decline of the team ...
'... is more important than individual victories . '
'for kaio to recover ...
'... it needs more players like tsukimoto of katase high ... '
what?
you've gotten slow .
three days off means a week to get your speed back .
how many days have you missed?
one , two , three , four ... ... five , six , seven ...
get out !
greetings !
i am sakuma manabu , of kaio academy .
i am here to play table tennis against tsukimoto !
aren't you worried about sakuma?
he knows non competition games are against club rules .
if he plays one and loses , he's off the team .
i'll play , but you'll lose .
listen to this !
he'll lose .
what did you say?
sakuma's going to lose .
tsukimoto's in there !
not now !
but he's so cool !
what's happening?
yuck !
it's hoshino !
want some sour chips?
they're excellent .
'suppamucho '.
i thought you quit ping pong .
i didn't quit living .
well?
give this to tsukimoto for me .
roger .
after i check it .
why? !
'do you have a girlfriend? ...
no !
hattori mako , grade 10c !
'mako hattori '!
change serve !
to kaio academy .
damn it !!
where did i go wrong?
i can't watch this !
sorry .
demon !
leave smile alone !
but he's lousy !
he'll get better with practice .
practice won't help him !
i don't care .
21 7 .
game , tsukimoto .
aw , shit !
why? !
why is it you and not me? !
i've tried !
ten , a hundred , ten thousand times harder than you have !
to impress mr kazama ... to beat peco ...
i've lived and breathed table tennis !
so why is it you? !
you just don't have the talent .
what? !
that's all it is .
it's nothing to start screaming over .
you can go now .
bye bye .
hey !
where do you think you're going?
where do you think you're going i said !
wherever the hell i want to !
where am i going , huh?
tell me !
kazama
rise to buddha , old buddy .
home it !
we were just warming up .
i asked for some better balls to practise with , didn't i?
oh , yeah ... they're on order .
you said that last week .
look , we can't spend the whole club budget on you .
what else are we buying?
hey wait !
tsukimoto !
there's peco !
why don't you come any more?
come and teach us !
girls don't go for ping pong players .
there's a guy there who chops !
a chopper?
the guy with the glasses .
smile?
nope .
but an old friend's an old friend .
there !
gee !
idiot !
that chop wouldn't cut tofu .
you're right .
see?
i'm teaching myself .
i'm totally impressed .
i had to drop out of school but i want to give it my best shot .
but this watch and wait kind of game ... ... just doesn't suit me .
some birds can't fly .
keep playing .
you've got the gift .
i'm talking about you , peco .
do i know you?
you've got an instinct for the game .
bullshit .
the fact is that you beat me and smile beat you .
so do something about it .
go screw yourself .
there are things only a hack player knows .
i'll say this once .
run till you puke blood .
practise till you piss blood .
you'll feel better .
if you don't ... ... you'll let down the ones who've always admired you ... ... me and smile .
haven't seen him .
coaching is more than just teaching technique .
aw , shuddup .
it's trial and error .
i've bust my ass over him .
that's why he took off .
if there's no love in it , you'd better leave him alone .
young man !
don't do it , son .
it's not worth it .
i had a bad day at the track .
all i've got is y60 ... ... but i'm not giving up .
what'll your parents think if you die?
die?
yeah .
you'll never amount to anything if you're dead .
i'm not going to die .
no?
i'm going to fly .
yeah?
great !
i can touch the moon no problem !
that's the spirit !
did i make you do that? !
are you strong?
... taste iron in blood .
hey , peco ... ... do you believe in heroes?
you're still here?
a coach isn't a coach ... ... without a player .
next time i'll kick your ass .
now i remember ...
... the one time ...
... that smile smiled .
this isn't a barber shop .
show me again , will you?
right from how you grip the racket .
5 : 04 ... no good !
do it again !
granny !
what?
i said from how you grip the racket , didn't i?
yep .
when do i start hitting?
i've been running for two weeks .
until you beat three minutes .
do it again .
nice day .
don't you have ... ... someone to pack you a lunch on a sunny day like this?
i've got a girlfriend .
just kidding .
you don't have to be surprised like that .
wanna go out?
tsukimoto !
hey , tsukimoto !
hi !
isn't this fun , mr tsukimoto?
are you having fun?
if you're having fun , smile !
i would if i was .
you would , huh?
damn right !
stop puking !
you'll hurt my feelings !
i'm your honey !
get up here and put your arms around me .
stop puking !
butterfly joe?
yep .
30 years ago , he was one of the best .
was he really good?
not just good .
he was beautiful to watch .
no one could touch him .
he was the king of japanese table tennis .
he was a shoo in for the national team ...
but ... ... i had a friend i'd hit against ever since i could remember .
he was really good ... ... but if we were both in good shape ... ... i'd beat him .
a knee injury ...
they said to take six months off .
so you defaulted?
i would have .
but it was my friend who had the bad knee .
i don't get it .
you could've played him deep then hit to his backhand .
could you do that?
would you take advantage of a friend's injury ... ... and risk ending his career?
could you do that?
that was my last game .
let's go .
coach ... ... i've always wanted to ride that thing .
well?
did i do it?
i did?
i didn't?
back to the dojo !
i did it !
three minutes !
am i awesome or what !
you're great .
we make a great couple !
i love you a whole bunch !
here ...
what you've been waiting for .
you're losing it , granny .
there's rubber on the back , too .
i'm not losing it .
that means you can turn it over to hit .
i thought you'd forgotten .
we'd just come to the end of last year's budget .
plus i didn't know where to order them .
will you hit against me for a bit?
you'd better ask coach koizumi .
the inter high's getting close .
i'll go easy .
these are good .
it's not the same .
now for some spin ...
damn !
that's enough !
no !
tsukimoto !
shouldn't you be warming up?
is he listening?
is he listening?
you'll be late !
who's my first game?
don't leave on me when you find out .
why do i have to draw china first?
i seriously want to go home !
i'm not losing it .
placement , control , speed ... ... tsukimoto's in another league .
hmm?
oh , kong wenge ...
he's gotten better this year , too .
he's headed for the top .
i wonder ...
he could lose here .
16 20 .
yes !
alright !
you remember?
the first time we played , you didn't win a point .
thanks , kong .
i learned something from you .
you taught me how to fly .
there !
the back side !
game !
hoshino !
that's my boy !
check it out , china .
you might catch me in 300 years !
hey !
you're in a game .
sorry .
get a move on , will you? !
hurry up , muko , or i'll leave you here !
hey , manabu ... there's a swimming tournament , too .
you can go jump in with them , then .
what's the matter?
i just said there's swimming .
swimmers have meets , not tournaments !
i should've gone to europe .
sweden , or germany ...
but i chose japan ...
say hello to kazama .
hoshino kong
i could cry ...
what?
did your friend win?
hello , mr kazama .
it's sakuma .
sakuma manabu .
i'm not going to let you ... ... show up my school !
how have you been , sakuma?
what?
i'm doing alright .
mr sanada never quits , does he?
if there's one guy he doesn't want to lose to , it's tsukimoto .
sakuma ... ... competition is there to show who's best .
if you say so .
it doesn't matter who says so .
now that i've quit table tennis , i finally understand ...
... why you shut yourself away in here .
funny , huh?
who do you play for anyway?
myself , of course .
you're kidding , of course .
if you mean that ... ... i was wasting my time .
be seeing you .
sakuma !
do you feel betrayed?
i sympathize .
what's the matter?
have you got diarrhea?
there's more than diarrhea that drives a man to the toilet .
what do you mean?
stay there .
i need to cry a little .
game , set !
hoshino , katase high school .
semi final round
game , set !
tsukimoto , katase high school .
you're in the final !
way to go , smile !
uh ... 'tsukimoto '.
where's peco?
in the medical room .
his knee's pretty bad .
aren't you worried about him?
the man's a machine !
i like it ... how cool he is .
no problem , baby .
check it out .
i had it retaped , and i got a shot of pain killer .
you don't know what a bad knee can do .
excuse me ... it's time for your semi final .
i'm coming .
no , he's not .
listen , peco ...
i know how bad you want to play kazama .
but if you want to be the best in the world someday ... ... you've got to have the guts to raise the white flag .
smile's calling me .
he's been waiting for a long time .
for ages and ages ... ... he's believed in me .
i knew it , but i pretended i didn't .
it scared me .
i covered my ears against it .
but he's waiting for me .
peco ...
... i love you , kid .
stand back !
stand back !
competitor coming through !
stand back , stand back !
there's a player coming through .
do you believe in heroes?
heroes?
you ok?
your knee ...
i don't know if it'll hold up .
but you're a high flier .
way high up there .
so i'll just climb your back , stand on your shoulders and ... ... fly .
a hero shows up in the clutch ... ... and saves me , no matter how deep a hole i'm in .
that's a hero .
here goes !
after i beat you , go out and get ... ... a haircut .
go get some hair .
i really need to take a piss !
he jumped over to his backhand .
he won't admit that hoshino's good .
amazing !
nice shot .
but ... ... you won't be there forever looking down at everyone .
'enter the hero . '
i'm the hero .
it's me .
he comes back .
my name is ... ... hoshino ... ... yutaka !
remember that !
remember that !
15 2 .
what's wrong ... ... 'hero '?
what's wrong?
aren't you the hero?
can't you fly? !
he thinks he's fated to win .
maybe for kazama ... ... table tennis is pain .
