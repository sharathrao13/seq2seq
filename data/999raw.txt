you know how in some movies ... they have a dream sequence , only they don't tell you it's a dream?
this is so not a dream .
it wasn't supposed to be like this .
i was just trying to do my job , and then things happened .
well , life happened .
and now i'm here .
catch a falling star and put it in your pocket ...
catch a falling star and put it in your pocket ...
trust me .
i'm not the kind of girl ... who does things like this .
i mean , two months ago , you couldn't have picked me out of a crowd .
hi .
call me .
told you .
i'm over there .
i was the youngest copy editor at the chicago sun times .
standard british callsfor '" re . '
so unless you're a pompous american ,
i would go with '" er . '
i had my own office , unlimited stationary supplies , and a professional , dedicated assistant .
thought of this awesome new phrase .
power is powerful . '
total t shirt , right?
awesome .
amazing .
what?
can i get my messages?
yeah .
hey , seriously , last time i saw you , did i look fat?
ok .
you hesitated .
no .
case closed .
forget it .
excuse me , merkin .
um , i noticed that there weren't any index cards .
i can't do notes without them .
hey , hey , hey .
merkin ain't jerkin '.
he's workin ', ok?
take that to the bank .
it's power , baby .
it's power .
my boss .
no .
i'm just a little tense .
i mean , this whole office is not feng shui .
all the desks are facing , like , evil , you know?
uh , do you think i should bleach my jeans ...
josie !
guess who i did it with last night .
roger from op/ ed?
ohh !
who told you?
you did .
you said yesterday , and i quote ,
'" i have a date with roger from op/ ed tonight , and i'm gonna do it with him . '
computer's down .
septuplet story .
need it by 5 : 00 .
hopefully the copy's not a mess .
it's '" hoped '" that it's not a mess .
'" hopefully '" is an adverb .
it means '" with hope . '
you have it defining the copy , and i'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings .
so , anita ...
you and roger in op/ ed .
oh , man , who told you?
roger in op/ ed .
really?
anita?
what?
don't make me send you another memo ... about my policy on interoffice dating .
it's '" intraoffice dating . '
and they're not dating .
they're having sex .
oh .
and what exactly is your policy , augustus?
that if you're not getting any , then no one can?
hmm .
how many times have i fired her?
five or six .
eight .
gus ...
did you get those story ideas that i left on your desk?
morning , mr. strauss .
yes , the blind foster home mother .
that was good .
i got kahune on it .
oh , yeah .
kahune .
he's good .
geller , we've been through this .
you're a great copy editor .
you're maybe my best copy editor .
you're not a reporter .
you've used 5 of my ideas .
gus , please .
every tom , dick , and harry thinks he can write , but a journalist gets in there where the bombs are falling .
he's aggressive .
he grabs the bull by the balls .
you don't think i can grab a bull's balls?
geller , you don't want a reporter's life .
trust me .
they're very messy , and you're all about order and control , and getting me my copy by 5 : 00 .
i can be out of control .
copy by 5 : 00 !
josie , maybe gus has a point .
you know , it's not gonna kill you to relax and have some fun .
hey , you know , roger's got this friend marshall in editing .
maybe we can all go on a double date or something .
marshall the duke?
i swear to god , josie !
come on !
tell me , when is the last time that you went on a real date?
i'm concentrating on my career right now .
do you own any colored underwear?
stripes or anything?
the right guy , he's out there .
i'm just not gonna go kiss a whole bunch of losers ... to get to him .
yeah , but you know what?
sometimes kissing losers can be a really fun diversion .
when i finally get kissed , i'll know .
ok .
if you've never kissed a guy before , we have bigger problems than the underwear .
i've kissed a guy .
i've kissed guys .
i just ... haven't felt that thing .
that thing?
is that what you kids call it these days?
that thing .
that moment when you kiss someone , and everything around you becomes hazy ... and the only thing infocus is you and this person ... and you realize that that person ... is the only person that you're supposed to kiss ... for the rest of your life .
and for one moment you get this amazing gift , and you wanna laugh , and you wanna cry ...
'cause you feel so lucky that you found it and so scared that it'll go away all at the same time .
damn , girl .
you are a writer .
ok ... finished .
what do you guys think?
where do you think it should go?
the bedroom?
that's exactly what i was thinking .
when i say that i'm ok
well , they look at me kind of strange
perfect .
surely you're not happy now
you no longer play the game
the meeting just began .
let me start by saying i was very impressed ... with that investigative piece that dutton did ... on pesticides in our supermarkets .
but since the trib did a piece on the same subject only better , you'refired .
dutton , did you hear me?
you'refired .
out , out , out .
close your cubicle .
bye bye , dutton .
hello , everybody else still working here .
let's celebrate by doing another undercover feature .
now , you know that my inspiration for these stories ... come , of course , from my personal life .
i mean , who would've thought that my foray into hair plugs ... would've resulted in last month's cover story?
'" hair today , gone tomorrow . '" a great story .
so anyway , last night ,
i'm sitting home with my family having dinner ...
roger .
and my younger boy starts to choke .
and i realized that my son was allergic to peanuts .
i said to myself , '" holy shit !
i don't even know my own kids . '
how much do we know about these high school kids?
what are they thinking?
and then it hit me .
boom !
'" my semester in high school . '
you .
what's your name?
josie .
jose?
josie geller .
josie geller , you enroll friday .
have fun .
the meeting just ended .
josie !
20 minute handstand .
freaked the yogi right out .
excuse me .
josie .
ohh ...
it's really happening !
my first undercover feature by josie geller !
josie , maybe you should turn it down .
why?
you don't think i can do it?
no , no !
it's just ...
this is a lot of pressure for your first piece , that's all .
i mean , this is not a half a page article .
this is a major undercover piece , ok?
look what rigfortjust did to dutton in there , and that guy's his cousin .
don'tworry .
i'm gonna straighten this all out .
neither of you guys think i can do this?
that's notwhat we're saying , josie .
anita , when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom , and you thought you couldn't learn spanish fast enough , who quizzed you on your verbs?
senorita josie .
and , gus , when you wanted to learn how to knit , who showed you how to work the needles?
um , you did .
you knit?
yeah .
so this is my chance .
well , i'm not holding your job for you , geller .
thankyou !
ok .
don't make me give you my memo on interoffice hugging , ok?
now comes the hard part .
oh , my gosh .
you get to be 17 again .
ok , what's the first thing you're gonna need?
you want bambi?
no way .
rob , please .
why don't you just borrow mom's car?
i can't use a minivan .
i need a cheap car .
ha ha .
a vintage classic .
it's just for a couple of months .
a couple of months is like 10 years in bambi life .
it's so weird that you name your cars .
why?
guys name their penises .
ok .
you can have my buick la sabre ... and name it anything you want .
really?
la sabre .
nah .
i don't think so .
fully loaded .
maybe .
are those shorts or a skirt?
they're gaucho pants .
i got them on sale .
aloha !
welcome !
every customer gets afree lei .
relax , vaughn .
it's just my sister .
aloha , my ass .
shake it easy , buddy .
hey , rob , have you talked to the admissions lady ... from lakeshore community college yet?
no .
but you could start before next semester .
you could even talk to her about a baseball scholarship .
it's too late , josie , you know?
i'm not going to college .
i'm not playing baseball anymore .
this is my life .
this is a luau that sells packing material .
you had such a shot at playing college ball .
you let a case of mono stop you .
don't you wanna move out of mom and dad's?
pay your own bills?
why?
so i can be as happy as you?
i am happy .
besides ...
you are looking at the newest undercover reporter ... forthe chicago sun times .
i am josie geller , high school student ,
senior class 1999 .
uh uh .
you're kidding , right?
what?
do you remember high school?
it was a long time ago .

thank you .
you're welcome .
i want to be a professor of medieval literature .
i want to be a novelist .
i want to be a weekendflautist .
i want to be a potter .
i want to be a painter .
i want to be an architect , and i want to go to northwestern .
i went there !

once to use the bathroom .
um , they have a really nice facility .
oh , my god .
hello .
i got your message .
what the hell kind of story are you pitching?
it's my dad .
he worries .
yeah .
mine , too .
yeah , hi , dad .
i miss you , too .
you're one sick puppy , you know that , geller?
it's an expos on cafeteria food .
let me guess .
you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw .
well , the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf .
geller , you wanna be a reporter?
take a look at what sells .
sex scandals , bribery , people jumping off buildings .
so , unless some kid just killed himself ... because he was being paid ... to have sex with the school mascot ... in a big vat of that cole slaw , you got nothing .
call me when you do .
they love to disconnect the battery , too .
here .
just so that you know ,
i think they recalled these cars in 1974 .
yeah , thanks .
sure .
no problem .
josie , i was wondering ...
how are you at calculus?
i'm good .
how would you like to join the denominators?
we have these really fun pizza study groups , and we go to these all county meets .
and not that you need it , and i don't wanna sound like the godfather , but we could offer you a certain amount of protection , if you know what i mean .
sounds great .
'" all the world's a stage , and all the men and women , merely players . '
does anyone know what shakespeare meant by that?
anyone?
it's about disguise .
about playing a part .
and that's the theme of as you like it .
now , does anyone know where we can see this?
oh .
well , rosalind disguises herself as a man , and then she escapes into the forest .
right .
and it's when she's in costume ... that she canfinally express her love for orlando .
see , the point shakespeare is trying to make ... is that when we're in disguise , we feel freer .
we do things we wouldn't do in ordinary life .
brett , what happens when you go out on a football field ... in uniform?
we kick ass !
yeah !
you yell .
you hit people .
you touch other guys 'butts .
it's ok , it's ok 'cause you're in uniform .
see , disguise changes all the rules .
she's spends all of her extra time ... with her family on a yacht in the south of france .
yeah , go !
quick hands !
quick hands !
here we go .
who's a winner , huh?
who's a winner?
focus .
good work .
good work .
easy , easy .
good work .
rob , thanks for showing me that new grip .
it totally changed my swing , man .
ah , no problem , man .
hey , man .
what's goin 'on?
hey , you guys know that girl , josie geller?
yeah , i know her .
you mean loser?
nah , man , she's cool .
i used to go out with her , man .
she dumped me .
but we're still good friends .
hey , really?
yeah , hey , wait .
like , how good?
like ... like good good?
she is amazing .
all right .
all right .
all right , guys .
as you've probably noticed , this , uh , this certainly isn't english .
um , we've combined a few classes today here for the seminar , and hopefully , the speaker will be here any minute now .
hi .
hey !
oh , hi .
uh , you here for the sex talk?
well , ha ha ...
i like a man who gets right to the point .
are you pam?
if you say so .
ok .
juniors , seniors , this is pam kitterman .
she's going to lead us in our sex discussion .
what?
what?
no , i'm not ... what?
oh , i am .
right .
that's correct .
hi .
i'm pam .
i'm pam .
hi .
uh , sex .
ha ha ha .
well , yeah , sex .
um ... what do you say , really , you know?
uh , you like a guy , you do it with him , sometimes he calls .
sometimes he doesn't .
oh ... hi .
what are you doing here?
i had a lunch break , so i came by to say hello .
god , your teacher is such afox .
he's coming back .
he's coming back .
uh , why don'twe talk about that ... later?
and i just want to say that the burning sensation ... is totally normal .
um , sex is really fun .
when you're old enough , which none of you are .
trust me , i should know .
'cause when you lose it to some guy named junior ... with bad breath in the back of a van ... at a guns 'n 'roses concert ... you'll wish you listened to your mother when she said ,
'" nobody's gonna wanna buy the whole ice cream truck ... when you're handing out the popsicles for free . '
ahh !
any questions?
oh , i know it's hard ...
i mean difficult , difficult , but safe sex is really important .
ok , so just imagine that the bananas ... are the real thing .
in a land called every man's fantasy .
god , i can't do this .
that's because we don't have sex with bananas .
ok , wait a second .
do you really think she hooked up with our rob?
i mean , they're so different .
well , sometimes opposites attract .
you know what , though?
i feel like i'm really ready to do it .
you know , like , have sex for the first time .
it's a big deal .
i know .
just make sure you've found the right person .
you know , adlie penguins , they spend their whole lives ...
iooking for that one other penguin , and when they meet them , they know , and they spend the rest of their lives together .
but i'm not a penguin .
oh , it's an analogy .
excuse me .
i have to go die now .
hey , kids , cindy here .
bad news about the prom .
east glen east is gonna do millennium , too .
what? !
calm down .
calm down .
calm down !

all we need is a new idea .

you are a great writer .
you just have to find your story .
he is your story .
you're crazy .
no .

what do you mean no?
he's got it all ... sex , intrigue , immorality in the education system .
he's my teacher .

there is no lid .
there's nothing going on between sa ...
mr. coulson and me .

everyone in this office is here every day , watching you two .
it's like the goddamn young and the restless .

yes?
ok?

proms always make me a little sad .
they're so final .
you know , graduation , everyone scattering , moving on .
is your girlfriend here?
no , no .
i'm alone .
infact , we broke up last week .
really?
that's funny because , you know , actually , prom comes from '" promenade , '
and you can't promenade alone , can you?
you're amazing , josie geller .
oh , oh .
come here .
come on .
come on .
have you thought about dartmouth anymore?
yes .

no , no , no , not now .
not now !
there's ...
there's something i want to tell you , too .
no !
no !
i knew it .
you are a loser !
you ruined everything .
you so do not deserve to be prom queen !
let me tell you something .
i don't care ... about being your stupid prom queen .
i'm 25 years old !
i'm an undercover reporter ... for the chicago sun times .
and i have been beating my brains out ... trying to impress you people .
let me tell you something , gibby ,
kirsten , kristin , you will spend your lives ... trying to figure out how to keep others down ... because it makes you feel more important .
why her?
let me tell you something ... about this girl .
she is unbelievable .
i was new here , and she befriended me , no questions asked .
but you , you were only my friend ... after my brother rob ... posed as a student ... and told you to like me .
robbie rob?
ew .
all of you people ... there is a big world out there , bigger than prom , bigger than high school , and it won't matter if you were the prom queen ... or the ... the quarterback of the football team ... or ... the biggest nerd in school .
find out who you are ... and try not to be afraid of it .
e excuse me .
whoo !
whoo !
yeah !
that was just like carrie .
i thought she was gonna kill us all .
all right , you guys .
go rams .
well , all right .
can somebody take the alpo girls outside ... and hose 'em off?
south glen class of 1999 , are you ready to party? !
hello .
we lost the feed .
gus is going nuts .
he's calling every five minutes .
did you get the story?
no .
please tell me you got something on coulson .
no .
i'm just gonna go .
so ...
surprise .
s surprise , you were doing a story on me?
no , i couldn't .
i mean ...
surprise , i was hoping ...
what?
what , you were hoping what?
what?
that ... that i'd be happy?
why?
because itturns out i was allowed to be attracted to you?
you were attracted to me?
god damn it , josie , you set me upfor a story .
no , i ...
i ...
just ... just dropthe act .
ok?
i mean , every word out of your mouth ... has been a complete lie .
i don't know you at all .
look , if we could just spend some time together , you could get to know me again .
wait .
please don't walk away .
i just can't look at you the same way .
rob .
hey , josie .
came by to check on you .
i was worried about you .
really?
no .
not really .
not really , josie .
how could you do this to me?
i helped you .
i got you everything you wanted .
and how do you repay me?
you blow everything ... two days before the championship .
i wasn't even thinking .
no , you weren't .
did it ever occur to you that the only time i've been happy ... in the past five years is when i'm playing ball , when i'm part of a team?
josie , it's not even about playing .
i taught those guys things ,
i helped them .
my life had meaning .
i ...
justforget about it .
it's over .
back to the tiki post .
totally lame .
josie geller blows her cover .
and we were scooped .
we've got nothing .
zippo .
josie , you totally and completely screwed both of us .
maybe ... maybe i could talk to rigfort , tell him the whole story .
you know , i'll tell you a story , ok?
it's about this shy copy editor ... who makes a total mockery of herself and her boss ... when she completely botches ... her first assignment as a reporter .
we are not ... screwed .
yes , i made a mistake .
but we will have a story , ok?
you will have an amazing story .
please .
oh , please .
oh , please .
excuse me , gentlemen .
i suggest you cover up what you don't want seen .
thank you .
coach romano?
yeah .
i'm josie geller from the chicago sun times , and i have a favor to ask you .
do you know the sports guy ...
jim lankin?
sure .
everybody knows big jim .
they try to get him to come out and watch all their games .
why?
well , what if i told you ... that i can guarantee you that big jim ... and every other reporter in the area ... would cover your game?
well , i'd say you could have whatever you wanted , young lady .
someone once told me ... that to write well , you have to write what you know .
this is what i know ...
i'm 25 years old , and i have never really kissed a guy .
a geek to the core , most of my childhood years were spent ... doing extra homework i requested from the teacher .
high school was more of the same .
then , at 17 , it seemed as if my luck was aboutto change .
the cutest guy asked me to the senior prom , but it turned out he invited me as a cruel joke , and i have never fully recovered .
yes , it is embarrassing to share this with the world , but it would be hard to explain ... what i learned and how i learned it ... without sharing this humiliating history .
i received an assignment , my first as a reporter , to go back to high school and find out about kids today .
what i ended up finding was myself ... and that high school hasn't changed .
there's still that one teacher who marches to her own drummer .
those girls are still there , the ones that , even as you grow up , will remain the most beautiful girls ... you have ever seen close up .
the smart kids , who everyone else knew as '" the brains , '" but i just knew them as my soul mates , my teachers , my friends .
and there's still that one guy ... with his mysterious confidence ... who seems so perfect in every way .
the guy you get up and go to school for in the morning .
south glen would not have been the same without him .
high school would not have been the same without him .
i would not have been the same without him .
i lived a lifetime of regret ... after my first high school experience .
and now , after my second , my regrets are down to one .
a certain teacher was hurt on my path to self discovery , and although this article may serve as a step , it in no way makes up for what i did to him .
to this man ...
you know who you are ...
i am so sorry .
and i would like to add one more thing ...
movers !
hang on a second .
i think i am in love with you .
and so i propose this ... as an ending to this article and perhaps a beginning ... to the next chapter of my life ,
i , josie geller , will be at the state championship baseball game , where myfriends , the south glen rams , are playing for the title .
i will stand on the pitcher's mound for five minutes prior to the first pitch .
if this man accepts my apology ,
i ask him to come kiss me ... for my first real kiss .
thank you all for coming .
josie .
oh , my god .
there are so many people here .
it's great , josie .
they're behind you .
they feel like they know you .
it's romantic what you're doing , and they want to be a part of it .
well , i'm glad that you guys are .
oh , anita .
sweet jesus , geller .
i had no idea ... there'd be this many tv crews here .
you have held up your end of this bargain .
i want you to get out there and get him .
josie ...
josie ...
josie ...
josie ...
yay , josie !
josie !
we love you !
thankyou .
um , may i have five minutes on the clock , please?
wieners .
i got hotwieners .
hiya , mr. rigfort .
get in your own row !
gotwieners here .
thank you .
have a wiener .
ahh ...
i love this .
sun times readers out here en masse , relating personally to one of our reporters .

hey .
