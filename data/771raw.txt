911 .
what is your emergency?
i'm tired of the way things are , as opposed to the way they should be .
is this an emergency?
where are you located?
that really doesn't matter .
can we have your name?
of course .
common denominator .
your man on the street .
now don't ask another question , or i will be obliged to do bad .
andyou would have to assume responsibility .
no interruptions .
natural selection .
natural selection .
born to win .
born to lose .
born to die .
three situations that make up everything in the world .
no interference is necessary .
but interference happens .
people interfere with an important task
i enjoy doing .
i don't believe people are not good by nature , not at all .
so ifyou remove the authority , the police ,
then you'll see life as god intended it to be .
a world ofpandemonium .
without police , the weak and diseased would be gone .
streets red with blood .
the way nature intended it to be .
there will be another body found tonight .
thank you foryour time .
april fool , right?
you're kidding , right?
you've picked a very fine diamond .
i'll tell you what , throw in a car and i'll take it .
throw in a hand , i'll take it .
perhaps a lesser gem would be more appropriate?
nah , it's perfect .
go !
go !
go !
go !
what's up , malloy?
you're losing your touch .
he'll get you in the rematch .
don't you worry , buddy .
i got plans tonight and they don't include you guys .
i'll get killed if i don't go .
she'll be pissed anyway .
one more round isn't gonna make a rat's ass difference .
i forgot i was dealing with the stable relationship brain trust here .
you guys ever heard of quittin 'while you're ahead?
you got a little drinking problem in this area over here .
give this guy another pop .
you feds any closer to nailing that son of a bitch?
what d'you wanna hear?
i got him giftwrapped out in the trunk .
we're gettin 'close .
that's bullshit .
no , we're getting close .
i hope so .
tucker didn't deserve that .
no cop does .
he's puttin 'bodies on display like trophies .
son of a bitch knows we're the ones who have to look at 'em , that's why .
look , i'd love to tell you we got this guy ready for a toe tag and a slab .
but we're dealin 'with a different kind of street logic here .
it's a whole different breed .
there's no repeatable patterns .
there's no identifiable method .
he's targeting cops , different precincts , different times .
every site's clean .
but he's gonna fuck up .
they all do .
when he does , we'll nail him .
come on , malloy .
we've had nine dead cops inside of six months .
if this was nine dead feds we were talkin 'about , that would be a different story .
a different story?
you really think i give a shit what kind of badge a man wears?
i think you're feelin 'guilty because you and your fed friends are droppin 'the ball .
what happened to you , malloy?
you used to be one of us before you became a fed .
ease up .
we're all on the same team here .
yeah , ease up .
you finished?
oh , yeah , everyone here knows i'm an asshole .
you got that right .
you are an asshole .
everyone knows that .
that's a fact of life .
bring these guys anything they want , please .
just keep their mouths full .
wake up , sleeping beauty .
you wanna tell me why you were late for dinner?
very funny .
got an excuse?
sorry .
how was donovan's?
how do you know i was at donovan's?
cos i called .
no , you didn't .
no , i didn't .
that was my imitation of your ex wife .
ouch .
come on , don't go there .
what happened to our date?
these guys are goin 'through a bad time , so i was just talkin 'to them a little bit .
it's always gonna be somethin '.
if not this , somethin 'else , mary .
what is this?
the beginning of a " you're just too good for me " speech?
is that what this is?
stop bustin 'me already .
lucky for you , i've been checking out the competition , and the pickings are pretty damn slim , so i was thinking , what the hell?
why not stay with me?
are you tryin 'to tell me somethin ', huh?
maybe .
maybe not .
i have a surprise .
i got this great surprise , but it's gonna have to keep for a while .
i'm gonna give it to you , but i wanna have a clear head when i do .
whatever happened to roses?
roses?
obviously you haven't been reading cosmopolitan .
obviously .
romantically speaking , roses are totally obsolete and monkeys are the new language of love .
i didn't know that .
well , if that's the case ... why don't you and your little friend come to bed?
i think we just got lucky .
forget it .
i work alone .
i could have made it myself , you know .
and you would have gotten another dul .
hey , jimmy , are you gonna tuck me in?
christ .
jimmy?
what the hell is this?
a treasure hunt?
everybody make sure you step on every damn thing you can .
you see anything you want , just take it on home .
friend of yours?
yeah .
a long time .
i can't find any sign of gunpowder tattooing .
the shooter was most likely several feet back .
he was in whispering distance .
see the starburst splitting of the skin here , doc?
gun was pressed directly against the head .
the killer wanted him to feel the barrel .
nine dead cops inside of six months .
if this was nine dead feds we were talkin 'about , that would be a different story .
let's cut him down .
how long do you plan to have him hang there?
junior hasn't finished analysing the body .
what do you think you're gonna find?
why don't you get that club out of his throat?
he's a cop !
let me handle this .
fine .
hello?
let me speak with agent malloy .
it's for you .
thanks .
it's malloy .
you andyour friend were out late .
who is this?
tell me , malloy , what do you see in that dead cop 's eyes?
do you see recrimination?
because it's your fault .
who is this?
they've all died because of you .
what are you talkin 'about?
we'll get to that .
but first things first .
you know , she's got a lovely place here .
nice neighbourhood .
it almost looked safe ... until now .
you really should have stayed home and played house , instead of playing hunter .
he's at my house .
her name is mary , right?
i'll bet she has nice eyes .
he's at my fuckin 'house !
1311 oak !
westside .
go !
go !
come on , mary .
pick up the goddamn phone !
send all available units .
i'm sorry , but mary can't come to the phone right now .
what do you want?
you're the agent in charge ofmy case , aren't you?
that's right , so whatever you gotta do , do it to me !
i am doing it to you , malloy .
and i'm doing it to her .
you still haven't told me what you want .
four years ago you were in charge ofan investigation ofa series ofmurders .
atrocities against prostitutes .
i call it removing diseased filth .
you got very close to getting me .
you'd rather protect them and remove me .
you made my life hell .
so now i'm returning the favour .
keep him talking , jake .
hunting the hunter .
i won't live long .
the odds are against that .
so what time i have left , i will dedicate to you .
i'll always be close , like hide and seek .
now , about mary ...
to kill a man is easy , but kill what he loves and he dies a thousand times .
please don't hurt her .
please .
i'll see you , butyou won't see me .
mary !
mary !
mary !
mary !
where is she?
mary !
mary !
oh , jeez .
agent hendricks !
we got him .
hey , tommy !
what's the story?
security guard spotted him covered in blood , dressed in swat gear .
son of a bitch didn't say a word , just opened fire .
guard ok?
he took one in the leg .
lost a lot of blood .
called for backup before he passed out .
i see you , you see me .
you on the roof , identify yourself .
identify yourself now .
this is the police .
you buyin 'shares in this place?
hey .
kill me again .
listen to me .
i ...
i've been diggin 'around .
there's this place out in wyoming .
it's a detox centre .
just hear me out this time .
it's run by a former cop for cops .
you know ... if she'd never met me , never knew me , she'd still be alive .
i'm where i wanna be , where i should be .
that's where i am .
ok .
i'll make you a deal .
you blow your brains out like a damn man and stop pissing on mary's memory one sorry ass day at a time , and i'll take care of your tab .
what the fuck is ...? !
what's the matter with you? !
it's all right , everybody .
a little accident .
everybody relax .
what's the matter with you? !
whether you like it or not , you still got a life to live .
it doesn't end here .
do you believe in reincarnation?
transmigration of the soul?
any of that stuff?
i do believe i was a shitkicker in a previous life .
well ... nothing a few nice curtains couldn't fix up .
hey , look , partner , if you ever need to return the favour , make it miami .
we run a dual diagnosis programme here .
a fancy way of saying we're gonna detox your ass and then tackle your demons head on in group sessions .
i was a cop for 12 years before i took a shot at drinking myself to death .
so i know what keeps you up at night .
gonna make it all go away , huh?
not even gonna try .
no magic wands here .
the shit you swallowed doesn't digest .
you carryin 'a weapon , mr malloy?
i'll have to confiscate it .
need the shield , too .
we don't allow crutches here .
thought i'd stick around awhile , burn up a little vacation time , maybe even rent me a cabin .
do some ice fishing?
yeah , why not?
see if i can't catch more than a shot glass .
hey , this is gonna be a piece of cake .
doc .
the man's my better half .
i sure as hell don't intend to lose him out here in jerkwater , wyoming .
do you follow me?
jack .
see if you can't find some boots and a parka for this man .
anything to serve these fine officers , doc .
you might run into more than a cool breeze up here .
come on .
let's get you checked in .
the place was built in the 50s as a command control centre for strategic air command .
satellites made the facility obsolete , so they converted it to a military asylum .
uncle sam put it on the market last year .
it's isolated as hell and that's why i chose it .
you're the last of our patients to arrive .
you know the rules , slater .
no smoking in the rooms .
i'd like you to meet jake malloy .
we got nothin 'to hide here , including our names .
slater , metropolitan police department of london .
i know it's a long way to come to quit the shakes .
club med was fully booked .
ain't exactly betty ford , huh?
last place i was at was a twelve step health spa .
mud baths , nature walks .
we don't got tv here .
convicted felons , doc , get tv .
jaworski here's a narc .
and a hell of a sharpshooter .
shut up , limey !
nobody's talkin 'to you .
this is jake malloy , fbl .
hey , we got a fed gracin 'our presence .
hey , malloy , any idea of the three most overrated things in the world?
home cookin ', home fuckin 'and the fbl .
let's get your blood and urine sample , see what we're up against .
our resident psychiatrist was an air force consultant here for four years .
when the facility shut down , she signed on with us .
she's pulling double duty as a nurse , till we get fully staffed .
we used to take care of almost 100 patients here .
there's only ten of you cops .
but judging from your case files , i don't think anyone's gonna be bored .
this is jack bennett , one of our orderlies .
jake malloy , new arrival .
if you need anything , ask jack .
he knows the place like the back of his hand .
that's what they say .
i know every inch of this nuthouse .
anything else , ma'am?
i don't think so .
manny , this is jake .
see if you can fatten him up .
hey .
hope you ain't a vegetarian .
gilbert , say hi to jake .
hey , jake .
how you doin '?
you wanna hear about the generator?
don't worry .
i'll keep her hummin 'with spit and balin 'wire if i have to .
and the boiler's about to go , too , doc .
then fix it .
you're the caretaker , hank .
have you managed to get settled in?
first night's a bitch .
how long you been here?
couple of days .
no one's been here more than a week .
don't have to meet them to know them .
take noah there , all buffed out like a fag .
completely paranoid .
back to the wall type .
got swat written all over him .
fuck !
fuckin 'motherfucker's motherfucked !
lopez .
lapd .
reverend jones .
worked homicide before he found jesus at the bottom of a bottle .
check out jaworski .
this guy couldn't even swallow a bullet .
stupid fucker missed his brain and blew half his cheek out .
see the old guy?
mckenzie .
member of the royal canadian mounted police .
word is he froze up , let his partner get shot .
they put him on the rubber gun squad .
all right , let's get started .
this is what i call the witchin 'hour .
no lessons , no twelve steps .
this is your time .
they told me to put 'em in the bag .
the pieces .
they were so tiny .
little fingers .
every once in a while i'd get a whole hand or ... part of a leg .
mostly blood .
it was everywhere .
their little fingers were just ... rolling around .
i dropped it .
i ...
i tried to gather 'em up , but there was so much blood .
i can still smell it .
21 preschoolers were blown to pieces .
some of their fingers still had paint on 'em .
they were finger painting when it happened .
you got somethin 'to add , noah?
this ain't the boy scouts .
this ain't about helpin 'old ladies across the street .
he's just a kid .
oh , bullshit .
he's just weak , like the rest of you mamsy pamsy motherfuckers .
if you can't stand the smell of trash , why are you workin 'in the garbage business?
maybe he's not as strong as us .
maybe he never learned to like the smell .
you laugh it up , smiley .
you sure as shit won't see me swallowing my gun .
so what do you swallow?
a fifth of gin?
maybe a little speed?
it ain't the same .
yes , it is .
let's be clear about somethin '.
you people landed here for a reason .
it's not just your careers you're killin '.
booze may be a slow burn , but it's still suicide .
de luxe cabin , my ass !
how'd it go?
the first session .
i don't know .
what do you wanna hear?
i got no more demons , no more monsters?
we all have demons .
but i stopped believing in monsters when i was 12 .
that's cos you never met any .
don't be naive , jenny .
is that her ring?
look , i know you mean well , but you're in way over your head on this one .
do you think words are gonna make a difference , gonna change anything?
they're not .
so just do yourself a favour and don't waste your time on me .
looks like we're in for one .
you know , my mary had a scarf like that .
we can't have this goin 'on here !
keep out of everybody else's business .
don't jump over my ass .
he's the one ...
i'm sure he didn't mean anything by it .
it's a misunderstanding .
yeah .
something like that .
the point is he ripped it off .
yeah !
fine .
suppose he ripped it off .
what do you wanna do about it?
did you take it?
jack?
maybe you should give it back .
thanks for the light , old timer .
stupid cops .
how you doin '?
do you wanna get some air?
if you wanna talk , i'm right over here .
looks like we'll be in this place a while .
hey !
no !
it's ok .
it's ok .
it was just a nightmare .
can i help you?
here , take these .
they'll help you sleep .
would you mind?
would i mind what?
stayin 'a minute .
oh , god .
can't get through .
storm must have knocked down the lines .
it ain't like anyone's gonna make it out here anyway , boss .
we're socked in .
i ain't gonna think about ploughin 'until the storm breaks .
what are we gonna do?
break the news to the group .
hank , you get gilbert up here to help you move the body .
i think i'll be goin 'with just a salad tonight .
did he leave a note?
none that i could find .
no offence , doc , but this mini alcatraz you got goin 'here ain't gonna change a goddamn thing .
you may dry a few of 'em up , but you ain't gonna change what they're made of .
the boy was weak .
we all knew that .
it was just a matter of time before old humpty fell off the wall .
and what about dudley do right there , huh?
what a peach he is .
30 years of bullshit war stories , only to leave his partner for dead .
alone .
no one to watch his back .
there's nothin 'worse in my book than a goddamn yellow cop .
you see what i mean , doc?
you ain't the wizard of oz here .
you can't just hand out courage .
you're real good at kickin ''em when they're down , aren't you?
do ok when they're standing up , too .
you never stood up to anybody .
yeah?
well , at least i'm there for my women .
that's enough .
hey , doc !
check it out !
man overboard !
get my bag .
it's in the office .
earthquake !
he's had alcohol .
what's wrong?
he's on disulfiram .
makes you puke if you even smell booze .
he looks bad .
shit !
looks like he swallowed a damn dog .
give us a hand .
what do you want me to do?
hold him .
hold him still .
a little aqua velva over the rocks?
i rest my case , doc .
hold him .
i want everyone's belts .
off with them .
now !
shoelaces , too .
do it !
i want the rooms checked every hour on the hour .
anything you say , sheriff .
hey , you know that hospital about ten or so miles up the canyon?
you mean the old loony bin?
yeah , right .
i got a friend i'm tryin 'to ring stayin 'up there .
your friend sick in the head , is he?
in more ways than one .
well , the lines are down .
you a cop?
thought so .
been a few passin 'through here lately .
one took a cabin for the night , bought out all my scotch , damn near tore it down .
another looked like he shaved with a cheese grater .
so how are the fish biting?
you happen to see what's goin 'on outside?
it's called the dead of winter .
i meant ice fishing .
i'd love to try my luck .
maybe you could help me out .
maybe .
fact is , you couldn't have picked a better time of year .
we both know that if someone really wants to kill themselves , there's no stopping it .
i know you have to believe that , jenny .
but i can't .
that's what this place is about .
stoppin 'em .
i don't get it .
why do you put yourself through this?
you got family , malloy?
no , i don't .
neither do i. no .
the job is all i got .
i'm not a coward , you know .
i know that .
but try and remind yourself now and then .
that goes both ways .
can't sleep?
i didn't mean to spook you .
i never knew .
knew you could miss someone so much?
i didn't know that .
just remember that sometimes the real bad things in life can make you stronger .
what's the matter , cowboy?
somebody steal your horse?
no , i just thought i heard something .
like what?
i don't know .
something .
cock a doodle doo !
good morning to you !
rise and shine , lazy ladies !
it's a wonderful day in the neighbourhood !
wakey , wakey !
oh ...
doc !
doc !
doc !
two suicides back to back? !
get mr fed in here .
he's seen his share of dead officers .
the bruise is in the shape of an inverted v.
what does that mean?
the markings say it's a suicide .
the v is from the noose .
if he was strangled , it'd be a straight line bruise .
hey , doc .
the waiting list for this place is getting shorter by the minute .
still taking bets on who the next suicide's gonna be?
the man didn't say it was a suicide .
he just said the markings say that .
and god shall wipe away all the tears from their eyes .
and there shall be no more death .
neither shall there be any more pain .
i'm tearin 'up here , reverend
shit !
i can't risk finding any more bodies .
i'll have to lock you in your rooms .
oh , you gotta be kiddin 'me !
i need to review everyone's case files .
lookin 'for what?
answers .
look , man .
solitary confinement?
no fuckin 'way , man !
it's for your own safety .
nobody lockin 'me up in no cell !
is somethin 'funny?
if the idea of a bunch of cops being locked up like common criminals isn't a joke , what is , then?
doctor mitchell , can i have a word?
what?
jack's missing .
jack's your responsibility .
maybe he took a joyride .
we're short one snowmobile .
he'll freeze to death .
he ain't the only one !
boiler bought the farm .
mm hm .
manny !
afraid soldier boy's turned into a human ice cube by now .
yeah , the hell with jack .
who knows what that crazy fucker's up to !
conner and brandon .
they weren't prior suicide attempts , were they?
i want you to lock your room tonight .
why?
please .
just do it .
damn !
hey !
hey !
come back here !
jack?
jack !
jack !
we're droppin 'like fuckin 'flies !
knock it off !
you're losing it .
you're all losing it .
slater's right .
we're cops .
what would slater know about bein 'a cop?
bobbies don't even carry a gun !
god forbid i put myself on a par with america's finest .
shut up !
communications are down .
our meds are gone .
one orderly and doc , who knows where they are !
and we got two bodies .
that , and you're all in danger of experiencing dt's .
sweetcakes , shakes are the least of our worries .
you got a medical degree we don't know about?
let her talk !
i'm not talking about the shakes .
grand mal seizure caused by dt's ... can kill you .
without meds , you're all vulnerable .
maybe you should tell them about jack .
hey , lady?
what the hell is he talkin 'about?
i don't know .
bullshit !
you tell 'em , or i will .
jenny , doc's missing .
two men are dead .
if there's something you need to tell us , now is the time .
you should check his service record .
i already did that .
the guy was a patient here .
oh , that's great !
the son of a bitch murdered his commanding officer over in south korea .
strangled him .
psycho !
and you gave this crazy fuck a job? !
come on , lopez !
back off .
since when did protecting women become your specialty , malloy?
you're right .
it's not .
my specialty ... is doing my job ... while the one good thing in my life is home , being butchered .
you talk about her again , i'm gonna kill you .
how'd jack end up working here?
i vouched for him .
he was totally rehabilitated .
what about gilbert?
a manic depressive .
he hates violence .
look , jack's got nothing to do with this .
i know that .
hey , people !
gilbert found doc .
jones .
jaworski .
noah .
lopez .
that's the scotch drinker , all right .
guess he never made it to detox .
you're tellin 'me this guy's a cop?
well , that's what he said .
now , what the hell is goin 'on up there?
i need to get up there .
whoever did this must have used a sledge .
they hammered the living shit out of these carburettors .
the snowmobiles are finished .
let's take the suburban , go for help .
if i had extra hands , we could dig our way out if we get stuck .
the freezer's fillin 'up fast .
i think he's right .
hank , take jenny and gilbert .
manny can help with the digging .
no .
weeks can't be moved .
we need someone here with medical expertise .
it's not a request .
you don't have to be here .
where would i be safer?
riding through a whiteout with some yahoo like hank , or sitting here in a room full of armed officers?
how about you?
no way .
i'm gonna go down with the ship .
you guys go while there's still some light .
we're outta here !
c'mon , gilbert , let's go .
now what?
we can rotate two man shifts on watch .
who made you king shit?
he's ranking officer .
i ain't in uniform .
i thought swat boys were team players .
my team doesn't wait around to get hit by a shitstorm .
we are the shitstorm .
i'm with noah .
i say we find this crazy piece of shit and frosty his ass .
how do you know it's jack?
how do you know that?
how do you know it's not ...
lopez , or jones?
how do we know it isn't slater?
how do i know it isn't you?
me?
yeah ... right !
you better keep an eye on that one , nursie .
he crackin '!
split the building into sections .
each person will clear an area .
point me in the direction .
i see you .
butyou won't see me .
he'll die without it .
jenny , where'd you find conner's body?
hank !
do ya think we can get the truck through yet?
keep digging , manny .
what was that?
gilbert's gone !
i don't give a shit where he's gone !
we're gettin 'the hell outta here !
get in the truck .
what's that?
look out !
look out !
anything scares you , kill it .
hank !
where'd you go?
hank !
jack !
jack .
gilbert !
wait !
hey .
frozen corpses don't bite .
you're used to seeing bodies .
i'm not .
it's ok .
weeks is burning up .
i need ice .
will you get it for me?
who's the fuckin 'brainiac that locked the door? !
shit !
what were you doing outside?
noah told me to check for tracks .
did you see malloy?
why?
should i have seen him?
is there something goin 'on here i should know about?
jack?
come on , now , jacky boy ...
no more games .
main circuit board died with mckenzie .
that means no power , no heat .
the emergency lights are not gonna last long .
great !
it's gonna be 20 below in here by morning !
this is bullshit !
this is bullshit , malloy !
come on .
malloy !
what happened?
jack and manny are dead .
hank's gone .
where's gilbert?
he saw me and he bolted .
he's still out there?
i found the missing snowmobile .
whoever took it burned the personal files .
why?
makes it impossible to prove who's who .
one of us isn't a cop .
give me a knife .
what are you looking for?
what are you looking for? !
confirmation !
confirmation of what? !
i see you .
you see me .
he's here .
what are you talking about?
he's here !
agh !
dead ...
dead ... dead ...
what'd he say?
all dead .
they're all dead .
open up !
come on , open up !
for the last time , i got out of there when i saw jack strung up .
i almost got lost in the blizzard .
i'm coming back through the utility tunnels when malloy comes in .
he's not just down there for a walk , so i hide behind the woodpile , ok?
it's not malloy .
i was with him .
he went out there to help you .
well , what do i know? !
malloy should stay locked in my cell .
just to be safe .
yeah?
tell you what ... you don't have to be a fed to read a flashing sign .
maybe it's time for reverend jones to explain the artwork !
don't you ever paw me , boy .
you understand?
maybe malloy was right about one of us not being a cop .
somebody was out there in that storm .
if it wasn't hank , or malloy , who was it?
you were outside looking for tracks , right?
right .
and i got locked out .
did you?
guess my cover's finally blown .
ignorant assholes .
it's not me , it's one of you .
get the fuck outta my face !
get the fuck outta my face !
drop the gun !
noah , don't !
back off !
drop the gun , asshole !
mine shoots bullets , too , motherfucker !
stop it !
i feel safer already .
christ , it's slater .
i'm very close .
so close , you don't know it .
i stare into your eyes , andyou see nothing .
i see you .
butyou don't see me .
so what did the fed say about all this?
he talked like it was someone he knew .
someone he tracked .
the cop killer?
he's dead , isn't he?
he'd better be .
hey , any cop killer steps my way , i'll cap his ass .
well , let's hope you do .
what do you mean , hope?
you've studied guys like this , doc .
they don't just kill you .
they play with you .
hey , man , i don't wanna hear this , ok?
they gouge out your eyes , shove things down your throat .
are you deaf?
maybe the lord's got other plans .
maybe we'll freeze to death first .
you wanna show us where that woodpile is?
what , are you nuts? !
i ain't goin 'back down there .
well , i ain't goin 'down there by myself .
lead on .
wood store's down this way .
sh !
you hear that?
hear what?
i think we got company .
not for long .
you two ... clear that one .
i got this one .
come on .
move !
i found that hidden above slater's room .
it's him .
he's taking trophies .
if we're gonna get outta here , here's what we do .
you and lopez check upstairs .
i'll take the tunnels .
jenny , you stay here with jaworski .
why? !
please , just trust me .
hank !
slater !
hank !
slater !
hey , cop .
drop the weapon .
hands behind your head .
fingers locked .
that's it .
now , on your knees .
you know , i like playing cop .
how do you like playing the victim?
huh?
d'you like how it feels?
come on .
please .
please .
wasn't it you who was gonna cap my ass , tough guy?
open your eyes .
look at me .
that a boy !
see?
look here .
you see somebody comin 'up them stairs , you let faith guide that bullet right through their head .
right?
malloy .
malloy !
malloy .
malloy !
i see you , malloy .
butyou still don't see me .
fuck you !
we've got to do something !
why?
malloy's already dead .
who was he?
who?
your stand in .
oh , you mean the real mr slater i tracked up here .
last i saw , he was detoxing at the bottom ofa frozen lake .
i didn't think you'd mind me borrowing his name and his badge .
from there , it was easy .
ijust came here and blended in .
you're real good at blending in , aren't ya , scumbag?
is that how you found out about this place?
just blending in at the cop bar?
that doesn't matter now .
what matters is i got to you before you got to me .
people will ask if i was insane .
just the opposite .
an insane man could not have accomplished this .
all these deaths , including mary's , weren't irrational .
they were to prove a point .
you cannot control what nature intended , malloy .
we 're born to perform a duty , which i've done .
and so you finally see me .
now what?
you know , you never feel more alive than when you're watching someone else die .
like when i stared at poor mary .
but once again , malloy , you're too late .
now i imagine you are staring at poor noah .
malloy !
malloy !
malloy !
dj vu , huh , malloy?
how many second chances do you get in life?
you think you're strong enough to stop me?
run , jenny !
run !
you're too young to die .
run , jenny !
run !
run !
i'll cut her fucking heart out .
jenny ...
i like your eyes .
let me see your eyes .
did i mention i hear voices?
right now i hear malloy ... pleading for his precious mary .
you stay here !
i'm gonna follow these tracks .
make me work for it .
do you see me?
cos i see you .
stay ... here .
freeze !
drop the weapon !
on your knees .
hands behind your head .
lock your fingers .
it's your turn now .
it's time to die .
now , look at me .
slater !
she ... called out your ... name ...
just before i ... drained the life ... from her .
i see you .
you see ... this .
you ok?
how was the fishin '?
icy .
