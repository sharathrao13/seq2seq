we found ourselves traveiling from town to town ...

that's right .
in fact . that ogi ... there's something not right about him .
i saw his arm .
he has a snake tattoo .
wait a minute ...
those names you mentioned ... something about a kuchinawa?

reaily . that ginzo hired one heii of a bodyguard !
masseur . better stay away from town .
shinkichi . is the bodyguard reaily that strong?
he's incredible .
if he and i fought at night . who would be stronger?

we would iike to apologise to mr ogi .
he hired us to perform . and we were very rude to him .
reaily?

because the blind ... they sense people better .
i knew you could see !
i knew the first time you came here .
you're the one who kiiled my men .
torakichi . too?
you kiiled the tavern owner?
he was just a street kid .
i took him in years ago .
i showed him the tricks of the trade so he could become my successor .
my whole gang destroyed ... by a wandering masseur iike you !
how did you know i was the reai kuchinawa boss?
when you knocked down my cane ... to check out the sword .
you're the worst crook of ail .
is that so?
not much more i can do .
the time has come for me to retire .
but i've iived a fuii iife .
