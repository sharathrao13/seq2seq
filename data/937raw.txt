i think that this could help you .
you know what?
why don't we all go out for dinner together ,
i can introduce you .
well if you think that it could help ...
yes , absolutely .
i'll call him .
ok , is there anything i can do ... to like " butter " him up?
anything he really likes? he does have a really serious latex fetish .
one will see how the dinner goes .
do you want to see a movie?
i had told to you that i have to spend the whole day to get rid of stuff so that mike can move in .
oh , right .
now that i am there , i might as well help you to clean and to organize ...
i just happen to have my labeller .
it is so hard to get rid of the things .
did you and chandler have to make compromises? when did you first moved in together?
chandler did .
what does he want you to give up?
a bunch of stuff .
and the worse ... he wants me to get rid of gladys .
who is gladys?
what a tragic loss !
yeah , i really hate to give her up .
oh i know !
you should take her !
me ...
i don't know ...
what , don't you like her?
of course i do .
why would i not like her?
i'll take her in a minute .
i think that your giving up too easy honey ,
i think that you should fight for her .
really?
do you think?
absolutely !
yeah , you tell him " i am sorry mike
i cannot live without her , she means too much for me .
ok , i will fight for her .
ok .
oh wait , i have just realized that if i do that ,
that means that you won't get her .
damn it , i did not think this through !
hello .
any word on casting yet?
joey , i already told to you that you're not right for the part !
what do you want mean?
rachel , don't i seem like the professor that you would buy a kind of e crap from?
sorry , this sounds like something that i'd never be interested in .
come on , please , it is not like i'm asking you for some crazy favor .
this is what i do for a living !
i am a professional actor .
oh man , i am 2 hours late for work .
this is a copy of all the commercials i've been in !
joe ...
look just watch it , if you don't like it , don't pass it to your bosses !
fine .
thank you .
work joe .
shit !
what am i going to do now?
just pass the tape along !
but he's not right for the part .
if i suggest him , my bosses are going to think i'm an idiot .
and that is something that they should learn on their own .
tell joey that you watched the tape and that you liked it but your bosses did'nt !
that way you are the good guy , and they are the bad guys .
that's good .
i liked it , they did'nt .
joey , for god's sake , go to work !
i cannot believe that i am about to meet benjamin hobart .
i always thought about him as one of the guests i'd invite to my imaginary dinner party .
you think that there is any chance he'd bring christy brinkley or c3po?
sorry .
i believe that that is just him .
charlie !
my god !
you look absolutely stuning !
well , i am having a good hair day .
it is so good to see you again .
you too .
i am ok .
i am sorry .
ross geller .
benjamin hobart .
it is an honor to meet you .
i would not know how to tell you how long i've admired your work .
i want to say , this nobel prize ...
i must tell you that you are one of the reasons i got into the field .
likewise .
actually not likewise .
i have never heard of you until this morning but ... it is nice to be nice .

i cannot believe that they have us let come back in this place .
you were not there .
no , but .
it is just a funny image , you know , you two in this restaurant , with ... with him ...
ross , why don't you tell benji of your proposel while i go to the toilets?
so , tell me about it .

break up with charlie .
what?
what?
did ... did you just say " break up with charlie?
well , yes and no .
yes , i did say it .
and no , i did not say it .
kind of inappropriate , don't you think?
i am sorry .
it is just that i have'nt seen her for so long .
and all these feelings are coming back to me .
i am starting to realise how much i missed her and i need you to break up with her .
are you serious?
if you say yes , then i am serious .
if you say no , then i'm joking .
no .
it is a joke !
hello , sorry i am late .
how did it go with mike , did he let you keep the painting?
no , he really hates it .
but he is going let me keep my box of human hair !
you must pick your battles .
the good news , it is that gladys is yours .

who is gladys?
she is that work of art that i made , you know with a woman coming out of the frame .
ah !
and monica gets to keep her !
in her house !
i am so jealous .
oh , i didn't know that you also wanted it .
yes , sure of course , but , you gave it to monica , so ...
i would give her up , for you !
you are not obliged to make that .
but i want to .
but i don't want to do that .
but i insist .
but i insist ... harder !
girls , girls stop !
we'll flip a coin .
heads she's rachel's .

i am so sad .

but you watched the tape?
yes yes yes , i liked it !
but my bosses did not .

i am insulted .
when i tell someone that i ...

oh my ... she is so nice and big !
oh monica , where are you going to display gladys so proudly?
we have'nt really settled on a spot yet .
hey !
why not just above the television? that way , it will be the first thing you see when you walk in through the door !
yeah !
yeah , and you will get rid of that french poster .
i like that poster .
really?
it does'nt have anything coming out from it .
or maybe there is some place for it in your bedroom .
oh !
there is noting above your bed !
are you still here?
oh , hello .
have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions?
your grandmother's nickname , perhaps?
and ann margaret's pants size?
i've come here to apologize .
i think i may have let my feelings for charlie interfere in the interview process .
no .
stop .
any way i have decided to offer you the grant .
really?
well , there is just one small ... stipulation .
i have to break up with charlie?
you got one right !
you are crazy .
crazy or ... romantic?
crazy !
or ...?
get out !
oh my god !
what?
joey , what is this thing doing here?
i got it from monica . she sold it to me for a very reasonable price .
joey , we are not keeping this .
but it is an original buffay .
allright , fine .
you can keep it .
as long as you don't mind that she is haunted .
what , what?
oh , what , what?
hey well , the legend says , joey , that she comes a live when you are asleep .
she climb out of the frame and she drags her half body across the floor ,
looking for legs to steal .
and then , with her one good hand , she slowly reaches up , and turns your doorknob ...
get that legs less witch out of here !
hey , i sold that to joey !
hey well , i told to him that she was haunted .
two can play at this game .
no , too late .
you cannot give it back .
yes i can .
no you cannot , she's yours .
she's yours ! she is yours !
she is yours ! she is mine ! she is mine !
she is mine !
she is mine !
girls , girls .
you do not have to fight over her anymore .
whoever does not get gladys get's gwyneth .
i want gladys ! she is mine ! she is mine !
to me !
to me !
look , i am sorry .
i didn't give them your tape . and i promise next time , to submit you .... whether i think you right for the part or not .
there is not the point , chandler .
the point is that you lied .
i know .
you are right .
what is it going to take for you to forgive me?
oh my god !
excellent .
now what do you say?
lying is wrong .
and?
and?
i am a pretty little girl .
i knew it .
your ex boyfriend is insane .
did you get the grant?
no .
and do you want to know why?
because your ex boyfriend is still in love with you .
what?
yeah .
he would'nt give me the grant because i didn't want to give you up .
benji is not in love with me .
i mean , he broke up with me .
and besides he is a really ethical man
really?
is this ethical to ask someone at a grant review ... who was the voice of " underdog?
i am sure he was just joking , ross .
if you don't believe me , lets go talk to him okay?
i'm telling you .
he didn't ask me one paleontology question .
seriously?
no , i am sorry .
no , he did ask me one .
how do you spell " boscodictiasaure?
if it is like lake bosco in congo , then m ...
damn it !
doctor geller?
charlie .
what are you doing here ...?
i want that you to tell her everything about the deal you tried to make with me , about the crazy questions that you ...
wally cox !
that is the voice of " underdog " .
like i tried to tell you at the time of the interview , ross , this grant is not based on your knowledge of useless trivia .
no , no , no .
don't do that .
i want you to look her in the eyes and tell her the truth .
benji?
allright , it is true .
i behaved horribly but it is only because i still love you .
and i would do anything to have you back in my life .
too little too late benji !
i cannot believe this .
i should never have broken up with you .
i think about you all the time .
i mean , do you ever still think about me?
no .
yes .
what?
i don't know what to say benji .
this is all so ... romantic .
or ...?
listen .
i know that i may be way out of bounds here , but is there any chance that you would take me back?
maybe .
sweetie .
this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable .
oh god .
i am so sorry .
but ...
i mean ... there is so much history between us , do you know?
i am sorry too .
i love you .
i love you too !
okay , that is it ...
we are seeing other people !
gladys?
third time this week !
this does not get old .
you are mean !
don't be such a baby .
