hello , bobby .
home safe .
who's that?
ol 'ben .
no .
poor old guy .
hey , linda .
hey , boss .
what's the score?
my kind of numbers .
i lost ben pulley .
he passed away onboard .
sorry to hear that .
how'd you hit it , billy?
didn't hit very hard , did you?
we all have slumps , but you're overdue to break out of yours .
did you hear the lady?
ben pulley's dead .
that old man pickled himself to death drinking 7& 7s chasing narragansetts .
linda , with ben , it was never a question of " if " , but " when .
i'll bury him .
i'll pay for it .
see , you got what you wanted .
bring in your fish .
it shouldn't take too long .
8 5 .
4 7 5 .
murph .
sign my ledger .
shatford .
sign my ledger .
what's the matter?
it's $2221 .
aren't we a little short?
we were sharing up last night .
i thought it'd be three plus .
you stocked 21, 000 pounds at 3 . 50 a pound .
that comes to $73, 000 .
minus $35, 000 for bait , tackle , fuel .
that comes out to $38, 500 .
i get half .
i own the boat .
your captain takes double share , four crewmen get a share each .
and a rookie like you , three quarters share .
that comes to $2221 .
what it is , is what it is .
sign the ledger .
moran .
you going out again this season , skipper?
why?
you got a site in florida?
bradenton beach .
the " cecile .
pack your shit and get out .
you like florida?
well , it beats the grand banks in october .
it gets rough up here , dougie likes the sun down there .
or he thinks he'll score better with another captain .
i didn't say that .
yes , you did .
goodbye .
here's your cut . $5923 . 76 .
sign the ledger .
that's a record low for you , isn't it?
next time , track linda .
she'll take you where the fish are .
you're getting to be rude , you know?
i like you , billy .
i always have .
but i like my boat better .
if you can't make it pay , i'll find somebody who can .
you trying to put a charge up my ass?
you're on a cold streak .
i'm encouraging you to catch fish .
i'll bring you more fish than you ever dreamed of .
next time i fish the grand banks , they won't be so grand .
you just struck out on the grand banks .
then i'll go further .
don't even think about it .
i want my boat back .
and i want to catch some fish .
it's what i do .
not lately .

i've seen them come and go .
the day i laid eyes on you , i said , " she's gonna be a good one .
you can't be good unless you love it .
the fog's just lifting .
you throw off your bow line , throw off your stern .
you head out the south channel ... ... past rocky neck , ten pound island ... ... past niles pond , where i skated as a kid .
blow your horn ... ... and wave to the lighthouse keeper's kid on thatcher island .
then the birds show up .
black backs ... ... herring gulls , big dump ducks .
the sun hits you .
head north , open up to 12 .

you lonely for that young mama who was all over you?
my girl is none of your business .
but you are .
if you don't like it , get the hell off !
all of you .
i look around and all i see are little boys sitting on their asses ... ... too scared to go and get some pay dirt .
pay dirt?
what are you talking about?
where the hell is that?
we covered the grand banks .
the grand banks are west of us .
i'm headed east .
the flemish cap .
the flemish cap?
why don't we steam to portugal while we're at it?
so this is the moment of truth .
this is where they separate the men from the boys .
how about it?
are you gloucestermen?
yeah .
but why go all the way to the flemish cap to prove it?
tell him , alfred pierre .
that's where the fish are .
do we have any other choice?
yeah .
crawl home , busted .

i never seen you scared .
it's pretty rough stuff out there , that's for sure .
we either hang out here for a few days till it calms down
but , cap ... ... we got 60, 000 pounds of fish here .
are we gonna let it spoil?
i thought we were gonna set the market , make a killing .
or we say the hell with it .
we drive right through it .

look at this .
we got hurricane grace moving north off the atlantic seaboard .
huge ... ... getting massive .
two , this low south of sable island , ready to explode .
look at this .
three , a fresh cold front swooping down from canada .
but it's caught a ride on the jet stream ... ... and is motoring hell bent towards the atlantic .
cool .
wait , wait .
what if hurricane grace runs smack into it?
add to the scenario this baby off sable island , scrounging for energy .
she'll start feeding off both the canadian cold front ... ... and hurricane grace .
you could be a meteorologist all your life ... ... and never see something like this .
it would be a disaster of epic proportions .

bobby ... ... i'm sorry i got you into this .
skip , we made the right call .
we had to try .
we were so close .
it was a hell of a fight , though , huh?
let's get out of here , huh?
christina .
christina , can you hear me?
i don't know if you can , but i'm talking to you , baby .
do you know how much i love you?
i loved you the moment i saw you .
i love you now ... ... and i'll love you forever .
no goodbye .
there's only love , christina .
only love .
it's been a week of round the clock flights involving ... ... efforts of half a dozen northeast air rescue stations .
however , as of this hour , the coast guard has suspended its search ... ... for air national guard para rescue jumper millard jones .
he leaves a wife and three daughters .
the search for the " andrea gail out of gloucester ... ... has also been suspended after aircrafts covered ... ... 116, 000 square miles of ocean ... ... without finding a single survivor .
we'll have more news after these messages .
i knew billy tyne .
i did not know his crew very well .
but any man who sailed with him must've been the better for it .
robert shatford ... ... dale murphy ... ... michael moran ... ... david sullivan ... ... alfred pierre ... ... may you rest easy , long liners ... ... in fair winds and calm seas .
for those of us left behind ... ... the unmarked grave which is home for those lost at sea ... ... is of no consolation .
it can't be visited .
there is no headstone on which to rest a bunch of flowers .
the only place we can revisit them ... ... is in our hearts or in our dreams .
they say swordboatmen suffer from a lack of dreams .
that's what begets their courage .
well , we'll dream for you ... ... billy ... ... bobby ... ... and murph ... ... bugsy ... ... sully ... ... and alfred pierre .
sleep well .
good night .
i'll be asleep ... ... and then all of a sudden , there he is .
that big smile .
you know that smile .
and i say , " hey , bobby , where you been?
but he won't tell me .
remember i'll always love you , christina .
i love you now , and i'll love you forever .
there's no goodbye .
only love .
and then he's gone .
but he's always happy when he goes .
so i know he's gotta be okay .
absolutely okay .
i love your dream .
the fog's just lifting .
you throw off your bow line , throw off your stern .
you head out the south channel ... ... past rocky neck , ten pound island ... ... past niles pond , where i skated as a kid .
you blow your horn and wave to ... ... the lighthouse keeper's kid on thatcher island .
then the birds show up .
black backs and herring gulls ... ... big dump ducks .
the sun hits you .
you head north , open up to 12 .
you're steaming now .
the guys are busy , you're in charge .
you know what?
you're a goddamn swordboat captain .
is there anything better in the world?
