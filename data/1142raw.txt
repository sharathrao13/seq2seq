unfortunately , the resuscitation attempts were carried out very late .
your mother's in a coma .
when can we talk to her?
alex , mum's in a coma !
mr. kerner , we don't know yet , whether or not your mother will ever wake up again .
can you hear me , mum?
you've got to wake up !
but mother was fast asleep .
in her deep , neverending sleep ... she circled like a satellite around the events happening ... on our little planet in our even smaller republic .
the 9th convention agreed to honecker's request , to relieve him of his duties ... because of health problems and thanked him for his political life's work .
congratulations !
her sleep obscured the retirement of the esteemed comrade erich honecker ,
her sleep obscured the retirement of the esteemed comrade erich honecker ,
general secretary of the cc of the sug and chairman of the gdr's council of state .
berlin .
this evening the wall fell .
unity and justice and liberty ... unity and justice and liberty ...
mother slept through a classical concert at the city hall of schneberg .
and the start of a gigantic and unique waste collection .
and the start of a gigantic and unique waste collection .
open the gateway !
stasi begone !
stasi begone !
mother kept on sleeping .
deeply and firmly .
she missed my first trip into the west , and how some comrades conscientiously protected us workers and peasants . and how some comrades conscientiously protected us workers and peasants .
of course she also missed my first cultural discoveries in a new country .
excuse me , excuse me .
excuse me , excuse me .
mothers deep sleep didn't allow her to participate in the first free polling .
helmut !
helmut !
helmut !
she missed how ariane gave up her study of economic theory ...
enjoy your meal and thank you for choosing burger king . ... and made her first practical experience with the circulation of money .
the sleep saved her the moving in of ariane's new boyfriend .
rainer , class enemy and barbecue man .
the furniture from the bedroom is going to the basement .
the furniture from the bedroom is going to the basement .
she missed the increasing westernization of our 79 square metre apartment ...
the old rubbish with the red dot is going to the bulk waste , okay?
the old rubbish with the red dot is going to the bulk waste , okay?
... and rainer's enthusiasm for the oriental customs and way of life .
the big hormanal ecstasy that i experienced watching a few beautiful legs , didn't reach into her night .
shit !
what're you doing there?
i ... the infusion ...
and not even the first day of nurse lara exchange angel from the sovjet union , penetrated her black dreams .
there you are again .
hello .
i was worried about you .
they've put me in clink .
mother overslept the triumph of the capitalism .
relief !
and the coordination of my hospital visits .
do you know what i noticed?
when she's in a good mood , she's carrying her hair loosely .
when she's in a bad mood , she puts them up .
and during the doctor's round , she chews on her fingernails .
don't you think she's got a beautiful smile?
her sleep ignored , how heroes of work became unemployed .
her sleep ignored , how heroes of work became unemployed .
the pgh tv workshop " adolf hennecke " was winded up .
i was the last one and i switched off the light .
then there was the reprise .
as a member of the quick witted east west team , i applied the reunification very early .
satellite dishes blossomed in our landscape .
denis domaschke?
domaschke .
denis domaschke .
alexander kerner?

don't be shy .
well , come on .
don't be shy .
hi .
and get along , guys .
hi .
hello .
knut vogel?
hello , mum .
doctor wagner said we should talk to you .
and if i can't be there in person , i thought it might work like this too .
it's 5 o 'clock now .
most of the doctors are gone and you've finally got some peace .
nurse lara , who's washed you , should be gone too .
if you could see her you'd surely wake up .
ariane sends you her regards , she thinks the idea with the tape is nonsense .
well , you know her .
she's just in the room taking care of paula who's getting her teeths and is screaming all the time .
mother overslept my unstoppable progress with lara .
our first romantic rendez vous followed 4 early shifts and 35 late shifts .
it's loud here !
our russian teacher came from minsk and weighed a ton .
and that's all you know about russian women?
the wind of change blew into the ruins of our republic .
summer came and berlin was the most beautiful place on earth .
we felt like being in the center of the world .
where finally something moved .
and we moved with it .
it's too bad she doesn't realize any of this .
well , maybe it's better that way .
everything she believed in has dissolved into air in a few months .
just like that .
and your dad?
he was a doctor .
he escaped into the west .
we haven't heard anything from him again .
the future was in our hands , uncertain and promising .
good afternoon .
we're x tv and we just wanted to ...
hello , do you need a satellite dish?
no money?
good afternoon !
do you like football?
then we've got something for you .
good afternoon .
we're x tv and ...
we're x tv !
are you interested in a satellite dish?
this is vietnam 1 , there's vietnam 2 and back there's the viatnamese sport channel .
alright !

that's the famous cut from 2001 , the one with the bone .
the cake represents the spaceship .

yes?
ingenious .

alright , everybody laugh .
alright , everybody laugh .
at the beginning of june 1990 , the borders of our gdr were worthless .
mother kept on sleeping .
we solve problems by making headway " and i acted .
mum?
mum !
can you hear me?
your mother's awakening is a wonder .
but she might not be the same person she used to be .
what do you mean?
there have been some cases in which the patients didn't recognize their own children : amnesia .
loss of memory .
sorry .
mental confusion .
blending of long and short term memory ...
taste and smell irritations , delayed perception .
we don't know , how badly the brain was damaged .
there are a lot of uncertain possibilities .
i'm sorry to have to say this , but mother is still in great danger .
i'm afraid i can't give you much hope that she'll survive the next few weeks .
well ...
can we take ... her home with us?
out of the question .
she is in very good hands here .
it's also simpler for you .
she can't take another heart attack .
you have to keep your mother away from any excitement , even any danger of excitement .
and i mean any form of excitement , mr. kerner !
any excitement .
it's life threatening .
and this?
and this?
isn't this a reason to get upset?
my mother doesn't know anything about the fall of the wall .
she'll find out about that here immediately .
your granddaughter .
your granddaughter .
mummy .

just this once , be realistic .
no , you be realistic .
what happens when she doesn't have a single room anymore?
or when someone lets the cat out of the bag?
she'll hear what is happening outside in here .
she won't take it .

excuse me , i've paying the rent for this flat for 5 months !
generous of you , rainer !
for the whole apartment !
47, 80 german mark !
in the west that's not even enough for a telephone bill !
and in the east you have to wait 10 years to get a telephone connection !
can't you just ...?
mum has to find the room in the same condition she left it in .
the doctor said she has to stay in bad okay?
so it's only about this one room .
and when she's better , we'll see what we'll do .
you didn't get what the doctor said .
mum will probably ...
that's what you said 3 months ago , when you wanted to switch off the machines .
that was a different situation , you can't compare this !
what do you want to tell her then , ariane?
that you've given up your studies , because you're selling hamburgers now?
enjoy your meal and thank you for choosing burger king .
8th floor? .
yeah .
elevator , hm?

you can say that again .
my life changed drastically .

the physiotherapist is coming 3 times a week .

your mother is going at her own responsibility .
you know how i think about this .
where is the previous doctor , by the way?
doctor wagner , he went to dsseldorf .
i understand .
and you?
when do you run away?
and you want to lecture me about responsibility .
please lie down a second .
why?

she mustn't wake up .
alright , boss !
ariane and i'll set up a schedule .
and there's the physiotherapest .
there's always someone with her .

most gdr citizens already exchanged their savings cashlessly .
there are only 2 weeks left .
you should hurry .
he who is late ...
excuse me? . will be punished all his life .
i can't hear it anymore .
excuse me !
could you tune down the radio please?
my mother needs rest .

alex !

hello?
alex !
nothing's changed in here .
what should have changed?
oh , if you're bored , you can listen to cassettes .
i'm afraid the radio receiver is broken .
but i'll repair that .
alex?
it's good to know you're not alone .
when your father ...
when he was suddenly gone ...
i didn't think i'd make it .
i never told you that ...
i thought about laying hands upon myself .
but you visited every day .
and you talked about school and sigmund jhn .
you heard that?
i'm sorry to cause you so much work .
i can't even use the toilet by myself .
mum .
that doesn't matter .
the important thing is for you to get well .
i'll try hard .
you have to rest now .
i'll just go to the shop , but ariane is still there .
oh , alex ...?
i'm craving for spreewood gherkins .
can you fetch me some?
no problem , mum .
that's what i thought .
at the end of june 1990 the shops of our socialist fatherland were emptied .
real money was coming in from the country behind the wall .
while most citizens queued in long lines in front of the republic banks with their usual patience ... we were still frantically looking for mother's bankbook . we were still frantically looking for mother's bankbook .
yearned for by everyone , the german mark flooded our little community .
halleluja , halleluja ...
halleluja , german mark !
such a day , so wonderful ...
and the money was exchanged 2 to 1 .
germany won 1 : 0 !
unstoppable shot !
germany is one nil up by lothar matthus !
mocca fix?
haven't got that anymore .
filinchen crispbread?
not for sale anymore .
spreewood gherkins?
goodness , where do you live , boy?
we've got the german mark now .
and there you come asking for mocca fix and filinchen?
over night , our grey store was transformed into a colourful product paradise .
over night , our store was transformed into a colourful product paradise .
and i became the king as a customer .
they're from the netherlands .
good afternoon , mr. ganske .
that's how far they've driven us already ... that we have to go fishing in the garbage .
mister ganske , have you still got spreewood gherkins?
what?
spreewood gherkins !
i'm sorry , young man .
i'm unemployed myself .
an empty glass would do , too .
i wanted to introduce rainer to mum today .
later .
we don't want to demand to much of her .
perhaps you're right .
yes .
i'm afraid there was a supply shortage for spreewood gherkins .
it's alright .
these are fine too .
listen , you really don't have to take care of me all the time .
it's awkward for me .
mum .
no , really .
maybe ... ... you could put the tv next to the bed .
then i'll manage by my own .
watching tv still is too tiring for you .
but why?
why shouldn't i ... be able to watch tv?
we'll ask the doctor .
mum , we have to talk to you about something .
it's like this ...
we wanted to ask you if ...
we need your authorization to access your bank account .
what is it?
do you need money?
no .
no .
it's just that you can't go walk the bank by yourself anymore .
and it would simply be better if ... you sign this .
yes , and ... maybe now would be best .
but there's no hurry is there?
you're keeping something from me?
has something happened?
are you in debt?
please trust us , it's important !
before i let you have all my money , i have got a right to know what it's for don't i?

with a pensioner from ...
munich .
since then his love for the party has suffered .

beckenbauer , rudi viler ...
you don't want to see it ...
germany made it into the finale !
while the world time clock at the alexander square rushed towards mother's birthday , a tiny round ball united the social development ... of the split nation and let things , that belonged together , grow together .
i slaved away like a hero of labour to resurrect the gdr in every detail in mother's room until this day .
have the cross word puzzles already been solved?
untouched like a virgin .
great .
i'll take them all .
oh and these ones too .
they laid my daughter off too .

she would really be happy about a visit .
have you really got it now?
i don't want to hear one false word .
and our 20 marks?
the work comes first .
the first guests were invited .
others still had to be persuaded .
a lot of people of the polytechnical secondary school " werner seelenbinder " ... had withdrawn to their private lives .
including doctor klapprath .

isn't that right , alex?
i admired your mother .
she was an outstanding educator .
i admired your mother .
she was an outstanding educator .
and an excellent human being .
that's why she was neutralized .
some comrades in the collective thought her to be too ... idealistic .
ever since your father ...
her idealism was well respected , but ... in the daily school routine , it ... can become problematic sometimes .
and then you simply gave her the boot .
you still owe her something .
yes .
