oh , la !
ya didn't know it was loaded .
sylvie !
oh .
can't he do something constructive , like start an avalanche or something?
vas jouer , mon chri .
when you start to eat like this , something is the matter .
sylvie , i'm getting a divorce .
what?
from charles?
he's the only husband i have .
i've tried to make it work , really i have , but ...
but what?
oh , i can't explain .
i'm too miserable to go on any longer like this .
it is infuriating that your unhappiness does not turn to fat .
but i don't understand .
why do you want a divorce?
because i don't love him .
and he obviously doesn't love me .
that's no reason to get a divorce .
with a rich husband and this year's clothes , you won't find it difficult to make some new friends .
i admit i came to paris to escape american provincial , but that doesn't mean i'm ready for french traditional .
i loathe the whole idea of divorce , sylvie .
but if only charles had been honest with me .
the simple truth .
but with charles , everything is secrecy and lies .
he's hiding something from me , sylvie ... something terrible ... and it frightens me .
does he belong to you?
it's hers .
where'd you find him?
robbing a bank?
he was throwing snowballs at baron rothschild .
oh , thank you .
do we know each other?
do you think we're going to?
how would i know?
because i already know an awful lot of people .
until one of them dies i couldn't possibly meet anyone else .
hmm .
well , if anyone goes on the critical list let me know .
quitter .
beg pardon?
you give up awfully easily , don't you?
jean louis , let us walk .
i've never seen a rothschild before .
clever fellow .
almost missed me .
thank you .
you're blocking my view .
oh .
which view would you prefer?
the one you're blocking .
it's my last chance .
i'm flying back to paris this afternoon .
what's your name?
peter joshua .
mine's regina lampert .
is there a mr. lampert?
yes .
good for you .
no .
i'm getting a divorce .
please , not on my account .
no .
i don't really love him .
at least you're honest .
hmm .
is there a mrs. joshua?
yes , but we're divorced .
that wasn't a proposal .
i'm just curious .
is your husband with you?
oh , no , charles is never with me .
what do people call you?
pete?
mr. joshua .
i've enjoyed talking with you .
now you're angry .
no , i just have a lot of packing to do .
i'm going back to paris too .
wasn't it shakespeare who said when strangers meet in far off lands ... they should ere long see each other again?
shakespeare never said that .
how do you know?
it's terrible .
you just made it up .
well , it sounds right .
you going to call me?
are you in the book?
charles is .
is there only one charles lampert?
mmm .
lord , i hope so .
good bye , sylvie , and thanks .
when you get your divorce are you going back to america?
don't you want me to stay?
of course , but if you went back and wrote me a letter ...
you could have the stamps .
i'll get you some here , okay?
okay .
good bye .
merci .
honorine?
honorine !
aaaah !
madame charles lampert?
yes .
i'm inspector edouard grandpierre of the police judiciaire .
would you be so kind as to come with me , please?
well , madame?
you are positive?
you loved him?
i'm very cold .
we discovered your husband's body ...
lying next to the tracks of the paris bordeaux railroad line .
he was dressed only in his pyjamas .
do you know any reason he might have wanted to leave france?
leave?
no .
your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the maranguape .
it sailed for venezuela this morning at 7 : 00 .
i'm very confused .
he was american , your husband?
swiss .
ah , swiss .
his profession?
he didn't have one .
he was a wealthy man?
i suppose so .
i don't know .
about how wealthy , would you say?
i don't know .
where did he keep his money?
i don't know .
besides yourself , who is his nearest relative?
i don't know .
that's absurd , madame !
totalement absurde .
i know .
i'm sorry .
it is all right?
i wish you wouldn't .
les effets lampert .
d'accord .
wednesday last your husband sold the contents of the apartment at public auction .
everything .
the gallery paid him 1, 250, 000 new francs ... in dollars , a quarter of a million .
the authorities in bordeaux searched his compartment on the train .
they searched it thoroughly .
they did not find $250000 .
these few things are all that was found in the train compartment .
there was no other baggage .
your husband must have been in a great hurry .
one wallet containing 4, 000 francs .
one agenda .
his last notation was made yesterday , thursday ... 5 : 00 p . m . , jardin de champs elyses .
why there?
i don't know .
perhaps he met somebody .
obviously .
one ticket of passage to south america .
one letter , stamped but unsealed , addressed to you .
may i see it , please?
my dear regina , i hope you are enjoying your holiday .
megeve can be so lovely at this time of year .
the days pass very slowly and i hope to see you soon .
as always , charles .
p. s. your dentist called yesterday .
your appointment has been changed .
not much , is it?
we took the liberty of calling your dentist .
we thought perhaps we would learn something .
did you?
yes .
your appointment has been changed .
one key to your apartment .
one comb .
one fountain pen .
one toothbrush .
one tin of tooth powder .
that is all .
if you will sign this list , you may take the things with you .
is that all?
may i leave now?
one more question .
is this your husband's passport?
yes .
and this?
i don't understand .
and this?
and this?
oh , i telephoned but nobody answered .
hello .
hello .
i wanted to tell you how sorry i am and see if there's anything i can do .
how did you find out?
it's in the afternoon papers .
i'm very sorry .
thank you .
i pressed the bell but it isn't ringing , i guess .
i know .
there's no electricity .
well , where did everything go?
charles sold it at auction .
this is all i have left .
i love this room , but charles never saw it ... only the things in it .
i think i prefer it this way .
what are you going to do?
try and get my job back at e. u. r. e. s. c. o. , i suppose .
doing what?
i'm a simultaneous translator , like sylvie .
only she's english into french and i'm french into english .
that's what i was doing before i married charles .
the police probably think i killed him .
instant divorce , " you mean?
something like that .
it's terrible to end it this way , though ... tossed off a train like a sack of third class mail .
well , come on .
you can't stay here .
i don't know where to go .
we'll find you a hotel .
nothing too expensive .
i'm not a lady of leisure anymore , you know .
something clean and modest and near enough to e. u. r. e. s. c. o ... so you can take a cab when it rains .
okay?
okay .
not a very large turnout , is it?
didn't charles have any friends?
don't ask me .
i'm only the widow .
if charles had died in bed , we wouldn't even have him .
at least he knows how to behave at funerals .
have you no idea who could have done it?
until two days ago the only thing i really knew about charles was his name .
now it seems i didn't even know that .
he must have known charles pretty well .
how can you tell?
he's allergic to him .
bless you .
do you know him?
never seen him before .
arrivederci , " charlie .
miz lampert , ma'am ...
uh , miz lampert , ma'am ,
charlie had no call of doin 'it that a way .
no siree .
what next?
mi pardon , madame .
merci .
pardon .
pardon .
pardon .
pardon .
who's it from?
the american embassy .
i bluffed the old man out of the last pot with a pair of deuces .
what's so depressing about that?
well , if i can do it , what are the russians doing to him?
hello?
hello?
is there anything wrong , miss tompkins?
uh , miss tompkins isn't here .
oh , i'm sorry .
my secretary must have gone to lunch .
uh , you are ...
mrs. charles lampert .
oh , yes .
please , uh , come in , mrs. lampert .
excuse me for a moment , mrs. lampert .
it's a stubborn little devil .
dry cleaning wise , things are all fouled up .
i had a really excellent man on the rue ponthieu , but h. q. asked us to use the plant here in the building ... to ease the gold outflow .
mr. bartholomew , are you quite sure you know who i am?
you're charles lampert's widow , yes?
i'm very sorry .
last time i sent out a tie , only the spot came back .
voila , as they say .
won't you sit down , mrs. lampert?
i've got something here .
i've got liverwurst , liverwurst , chicken and liverwurst .
no , thank you .
mrs. lampert , do you know what c. i. a. is?
i don't suppose it's an airline , is it?
central intelligence agency .
c. i. a.
you mean spies and all of that?
only we call them agents .
" we "?
you mean you ...
someone has to do it , mrs. lampert .
i didn't think people like you were supposed to admit ...
oh , i'm not an agent .
i'm an administrator , a desk jockey ... trying to run a bureau of overworked men with underallocated ...
funds .
congress seems to think that all a spy needs ...
agent .
yes .
that all he needs is a code book , a cyanide pill and he's in business .
what's all this got to do with me , mr. bartholomew?
your husband was wanted by the united states government .
may i have a sandwich , please?
chicken or liverwurst?
chicken .
to be more specific , your husband was wanted by this agency .
so that was it .
yes .
we , of course , knew him by his real name ...
voss .
charles voss .
all right , mrs. voss .
i'd like you to look at this photograph for a moment , please .
tell us if you recogni ...
oh .
by the way , have you seen this one?
scott , cathy and ham jr .
very sweet .
aren't they?
all right , mrs. voss ...
please stop calling me that .
lampert's the name on the marriage license .
i'm terribly sorry .
mrs. lampert , would you look at that and tell me if you recognize anyone?
just a moment .
have a good look .
it's charles .
very good .
he looks so young .
when was this taken?
1944 .
next , please .
the man who was at the funeral yesterday .
a tall man in a corduroy suit .
does the name tex penthollow mean anything to you?
no .
you like some wine?
no , thank you .
next , please .
he was there too .
a little less hair , but it's the same one .
do you know him , mrs. lampert?
leopold w. gideon?
no .
the last one , please .
that's a face you don't forget .
he was there too .
herman scobie .
you've never seen him before either?
no , thank heaven .
mrs. lampert , i'm afraid you are in a great deal of danger .
why should i be in any danger?
you're charles voss 'wife .
now that he's dead you're their only lead .
mr. bartholomew , if you're trying to frighten me ... you're doing a first rate job .
please do what we ask , mrs. lampert .
it's your only chance .
gladly .
but i don't know what you want .
you haven't told me .
oh?
i haven't?
well , it's the money , mrs. lampert , the money .
the $250, 000 charles voss received from the auction .
those three men want it too .
they want it very badly .
but that's charles 'money , not theirs .
oh , mrs. lampert , i'd love to see you try and convince them of that .
oh , boy .
but then whose is it?
his or theirs?
ours .
oh .
charles voss stole $250, 000 from the united states government .
i'm afraid we want it back .
but i don't have it .
that's impossible , mrs. lampert .
you're the only one who could have it .
mr. bartholomew , if i had a quarter of a million dollars , believe me , i'd know it .
nevertheless , mrs. lampert , you've got it .
you mean it's just lying around somewhere , all that cash?
or a certified check , safe deposit key , baggage claim .
you look for it , mrs. lampert .
i'm quite sure you'll find it .
but ...
look for it .
look just as hard and as fast as you can .
you may not have a great deal of time .
those three men know you've got the money just as surely as we do .
you won't be safe until the money's in our hands .
is that clear?
here's where you're to call me , day or night .
it's a direct line to both my office ...
and my apartment .
and please don't tell anyone about coming to see us today .
it could prove fatal for them as well as yourself .
as i said , mrs. lampert , i'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger .
i regret very much having to say this , but ... please remember what happened to your husband .
hello .
hello , peter .
didn't you telephone me to meet you on that corner over there?
i'm sorry .
i heard the children laughing .
do you understand french?
not a word .
i'm still having trouble with english .
the man and the woman are married .
oh , i can see that .
they're batting each other over the head .
ay , ay , ay !
ooh , la , la , la !
qu'est ce qu'll se passe?
who's that with the hat?
that's the policeman .
he wants to arrest judy for killing punch .
what's she saying now?
that she's innocent .
she didn't do it .
oh , she did it , all right .
i believe her .
well , who was that?
that's punch , of course .
punch , of course "?
i thought he was dead .
he's only pretending , to teach her a lesson .
only he is dead , peter .
i saw him .
he's not pretending .
somebody threw him off a train .
charles was mixed up in something terrible .
what am i going to do?
i wish you'd let me help you .
it doesn't sound like the sort of thing a young woman can handle by herself .
how 'bout making me vice president in charge of cheering you up?
starting tonight?
bonsoir , messieurs , dames , ladies and gentlemen , buona sera , signore e signori .
ce soir , comme tous les autres soirs d'ailleurs , vous savez bien ... qui ici au black sheep club , i'attraction , c'est vous !
alors , approchez vous , messieurs , dames , venez ici , step right up , ladies and gentlemen ,
what's going on?
fun and games .
evidently we're the floor show .
come on .
you and me?
everyone .
avanti , avanti , signore e signori .
ecoutez moi bien .
ah , coutez moi .
alors , il y a deux quipes .
there are two teams , et pour chaque quipe , il y a une orange .
for every team there is one orange .
una aranja .
vous mettez i'orange sur le menton comme a ... put the orange in like so .
vous passez i'orange la personne derrire vous ...
you pass the orange to the person behind you , mais sans utilisez les mains .
without the use of your hands .
are you ready?
uno , due , tre ...
mrs. lampert , who are you?
didn't charles tell you , mrs. lampert?
tell me what?
it doesn't belong to you .
you do know that , don't you?
i don't know anyth ...
mrs. lampert !
any morning now you could wake up dead , mrs. lampert .
leave me alone !
dead , mrs. lampert .
like charles , mrs. lampert .
stop it !
what's the trouble?
he stepped on my foot .
forgive me .
wait here .
i won't be long .
it was quite unintentional , i'm sure .
mr. bartholomew , this is regina lampert .
i just saw one of those m ...
mr. bartholomew , can you hear me?
mr. bartholomew , this is regina lampert .
i just ...
howdy .
what do you want?
you must be kiddin '.
no , i'm not .
come on now , miz lampert .
you know what it is , and you're gonna get it for me too .
'cause you know i ain't foolin 'around here .
no siree bob .
stop that , please !
now , don't make too much noise , miz lampert .
it could get a whole lot worse , you know .
it belongs to me , miz lampert , and you're gonna get it for me ,
or your life ain't gonna be worth the paper it's printed on .
you understand what i'm sayin 'to you?
stop !
please stop !
you go home and think it over real careful like , you hear?
you're absolutely insane !
aaaaah !
what's the matter?
what are you doing in here?
i'm having a nervous breakdown .
now hold it .
i've waited long enough .
what happened back there?
i'm not sure if i'm supposed to tell you or not .
what does that mean?
he said if i told anybody ... it could prove fatal for them as well as me .
who said?
that's what i'm not supposed to say .
eh ...
now stop that nonsense .
stop bullying me .
everybody's bullying me .
i'm not bullying you .
yes , you were .
you said it was nonsense .
being murdered in cold blood is not nonsense .
why don't you try it sometime?
would you mind seeing me to the door?
of course not .
it's a good place for making friends .
you said this afternoon your husband was mixed up in something .
how do you shave in there?
what was it?
what was what?
what your husband was mixed up in .
look , i know it's asking you to stretch your imagination , but don't you think ... you could pretend just for a moment that i'm a woman?
i could already be arrested for transporting a minor above the first floor .
here you are .
where?
on the street where you live .
how about once more around the park?
how about getting out of here?
come on , child .
out .
won't you come in for a minute?
no , i won't .
i don't bite , you know , unless it's called for .
how would you like a spanking?
how'd you like a punch in the nose?
stop treating me like a child .
well , then stop behaving like one .
if you want to tell me what's troubling you , fine .
if not , i'm tired , it's late and i want to go home to bed .
oh ...
do you know what's wrong with you?
no .
what?
nothing .
aaaah !
where is it , lady?
i don't know .
i want it .
you give it to me .
it's mine !
aaaaah !
peter !
peter !
a man tried to kill me !
what?
peter?
peter?
peter , are you all right?
oh , peter .
are you hurt?
mm hmm .
i sprained my pride .
how are you?
scared .
you'll be all right .
where did he go?
out the window , i guess .
lock the door , and don't let anyone in except me .
and close these windows after me .
be careful .
you took the words right out of my mouth .
alistair !
what is it now , pamela?
it happened again !
another strange man peered in the window at me but then went away .
bad luck , pamela .
that was a dumb move , herman .
oh , man .
and then some .
if you'd let us know you was goin 'to her room ... we could have done somethin 'to keep him busy .
but sneakin 'up that a way by yourself .
what did you expect him to do?
walk up and shake you by that hand of yours?
dumb move , herman .
yes , it was a dumb move , herman .
what is the matter with you?
you want some more?
never mind that .
did you get the money?
how could i with the three marx brothers breathing down my neck?
i thought we had an agreement .
now , the girl trusts me .
if she's got the money i'll find out about it .
but you just leave me alone .
we took all the chances .
the money belongs to us , not to him .
now , don't be piggy , herman .
a third of nothing is nothing .
just think about that .
but make up your mind .
she's waiting for me .
i don't see how another 24 hours could hurt anything .
not after all these years .
then he gets it out of your share .
not mine .
not mine !
either one of you got the room next to her?
yeah , i have .
why?
get another room .
i want to use it .
hmm .
if you do find that money , you ain't gonna forget to tell your buddies about it , are you?
don't worry .
oh , i ain't worryin '.
you see this little fella here?
oh , he worries .
and he's even meaner than i am .
who is it?
it's me , peter .
there was no trace of him .
why don't you confide in me and tell me what this is all about?
there are three men .
he's one of them .
they think i have a quarter of a million dollars that belongs to them .
go on .
that's all .
no , it isn't .
where's the money?
i don't know !
they killed charles to get it , but he must not have had it with him on the train .
so they think he left it with you .
but he didn't .
i've looked everywhere , and if i don't find it they're going to kill me .
no , they won't .
i won't let them .
peter , help me .
you're the only one i can trust .
i'll help you .
i told you i would .
come on .
oh , i'm so hungry i could faint .
and i've gotten your suit all wet .
that's all right .
it's a drip dry .
wipe your eyes .
promise me you'll never lie to me the way charles did .
why do people have to tell lies?
usually because they want something .
they're afraid the truth won't get it .
do you tell lies?
hello?
mrs. lampert , it's me , the man who was in your room a few minutes ago .
what do you want?
who is it?
it's the man you had the fight with .
is dyle with you?
who?
the man i had the fight with , lady .
dyle .
that's his name .
what's wrong?
is he still there?
yes , that's right .
what's he saying?
don't trust him .
don't tell him anything .
he's after the money .
what was all that about?
he ...
he said if i don't give him the money he'll kill me .
oh , don't take it seriously .
he's just trying to frighten you .
i believe what he said .
no , no .
it's just a lot of words .
words can hurt .
i know .
try to get some sleep .
you'll feel better .
don't worry .
i've arranged to take the room next door to you .
so you'll be all right .
if you want anything , just bang on the wall .
better lock the door after me .
good night .
i am calm , mr. bartholomew .
what i'm trying to say is that there's someone else .
what?
someone who wasn't in that photograph today .
he says his name is peter joshua , but it isn't .
it's dyle .
are you still there , mr. bartholomew?
yes , yes , mrs. lampert .
i don't know who this mr. dyle is , but it's possible we were wrong about who killed your husband .
you mean ... he might have?
mr. bartholomew , i'm catching the next plane out of here .
i'm not going to sit around for somebody to make chopped liver out of me .
now , take it easy , mrs. lampert .
take it easy .
where are you now?
can you meet me at the market?
at les halles?
yes .
opposite st. eustace .
i'll meet you there in 15 minutes .
all right , i'll be there .
allez vite , n'importe ou .
n'importe ou !
vite !
suivez ce taxi .
were you followed?
yes , by dyle .
but i lost him .
i'm beginning to think women make the best spies .
agents .
he has a gun , mr. bartholomew .
no .
but i saw it .
no , that's not carson dyle .
carson?
there's only one dyle connected with this affair , mrs. lampert .
that's carson dyle .
you mean you've known about him all along?
it's enough to make you a vegetarian , isn't it?
it's just lucky i'm not hanging next to one of those right now .
why didn't you tell me you knew about dyle?
i didn't see any point .
dyle's dead .
mr. bartholomew , what is all this about?
in 1944 , five members of the o. s. s ... the military espionage unit ... were ordered behind the german lines ... for the purpose of delivering $250, 000 in gold ... to the french underground .
the five men were your husband charles , the three men at his funeral yesterday ...
and carson dyle .
oh .
but instead of delivering the gold , they stole it .
how?
by burying it , then reporting the germans had captured it .
all they had to do was come back after the war , dig it up and split it five ways .
quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked .
may i have a cigarette , please?
i can't stand those things .
it's like drinking coffee through a veil .
everything went smoothly enough until after the gold was buried .
before they could get out they were ambushed by a german patrol .
a machine gun separated scobie from his right hand ... and caught carson dyle full in the stomach .
what was wrong with that one?
nothing , i guess .
what happened then?
have you any idea what these things cost over here?
please go on , mr. bartholomew .
what happened then?
carson dyle was dead , but scobie was able to travel .
so ...
la soupe , c'est pour qui?
pour moi .
where was i?
carson dyle was dead .
yes .
the others finally got back to the base and waited for the war to end , only charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others .
he beat them back to the gold , took everything for himself and disappeared .
it's taken gideon , tex and scobie all this time to catch up with him again .
but if they stole all that money , why can't you arrest them?
shh !
we know what happened from the bits we were able to paste together , but we still have no proof .
what's this got to do with the c. i. o.?
c. i. a. , mrs. lampert .
it's an extension of the wartime o. s. s.
it's our money and we want it back .
i'm sorry , mr. bartholomew , but nothing you've said has changed my mind .
i'm leaving paris tonight .
wouldn't advise that , mrs. lampert .
better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave .
those men won't be very far away no matter where you go .
in fact , i don't even see any point in your changing hotels .
now , please help us , mrs. lampert .
your government is counting on you .
well , if i'm going to die i might as well do it for my country .
that's the spirit .
here's what i want you to do .
we're anxious to know who this man is , the one calling himself dyle .
i want you to find out .
why me?
you're in an ideal position .
he trusts you .
besides , you yourself said women make the best spies .
agents .
oh , pardon .
fraulein .
fraulein !
what are you doing following me?
it's gonna look like a parade .
stop it !
how are you?
nice to see you .
when did you arrive?
it's a lovely town .
are you having a good time?
so many things to see .
fraulein !
fraulein !
if you don't stop following me i'll call the police !

d y l e. yes , mr. dyle .

thank you .
mr. dyle , please .
you're wanted on the telephone .
mr. dyle .
cabin four .
mr. dyle .
cabin four , please .
yes?
good morning , mr. dyle .
reggie?
it's the only name i've got .
how 'bout you?
no cat and mouse .
you've got me .
what do you want to know?
why you lied to me !
i had to .
for all i knew you were in on the whole thing .
i'm trying to find out who you are .
you know my name .
it's dyle .
carson dyle is dead .
yes , he is .
he was my brother .
your brother?
the army thinks he was killed in action by the germans , but i think they did it ...
tex , gideon , scobie and your husband ... because my brother wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold .
i think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him .
i'm trying to prove it .
they think i'm working with them , but i'm not , reggie .
i'm on your side .
just believe that .
how can i?
you lied to me just the way charles did .
after promising you wouldn't .
oh , i want to believe you , peter ...
i can't call you that anymore , can i?
take me a while to get used to your new name .
what is it?
hmm?
hello?
hello?
do anything funny or try to talk to anyone and i'll kill you , dyle .
you'll wreck your raincoat .
take the next car , please .
look out .
didn't want you to bump your head .
all right , get in there .
all right , turn around .
now sit down .
now what?
we wait .
with our mouth shut .
oh , i'm sorry about that .
okay .
up there .
do i knock or something?
no , open it ... and keep right on goin '.
the view had better be worth it .
very pretty .
now what?
i was afraid of that .
i'll give you a chance , dyle , which is more than you'd give me .
where's the money?
is that why you dragged me all the way up here?
to ask me that?
she has it .
and i say maybe you both have it .
one more time , dyle .
where is it?
supposing i had it ... which i don't ... do you really think i'd just hand it over to you?
step back .
back where?
that's the idea .
hmm .
n now , just a minute .
take it easy .
herman?
what?
how you doing?
how do you think?
if you get bored , try writing " love thy neighbor " 100 times on the side of the building .
monsieur , next time , please , use the keyhole , hmm?
is that you?
yeah .
you gonna open up?
sure .
wait a minute .
don't you know it's impolite to leave someone holding ... the phone?
what happened?
oh , i met a man with sharp nails .
scobie?
mm hmm .
i left him hanging around the american express .
come in .
i've got something that stings like crazy .
you're the kind of girl that'd have something like that .
sit down .
uh , w w wait a minute .
w w what is that stuff?
marvelous stuff .
gonna hurt you much more than it's gonna hurt me .
i'll bet ...
ohh !
did you hear something rip?
no .
oh .
that's odd .
listen , i i only came in for an estimate .
sit still .
it's not too bad .
you won't be able to lie on your back for a few days .
but then , you can lie from any position , can't you?
oh ho ho ...
ooooh !
does it hurt?
what?
does it hurt?
ohh !
are you kidding?
have you got a bullet i could bite , like they do in the movies?
are you really carson dyle's brother?
would you like to see my passport?
passport?
what kind of a proof is that?
well , would you like to see where i was tattooed?
yes .
all right , we'll drive around that way .
you could at least tell me what your first name is these days .
alexander .
okay , alexander .
you're done .
good .
you're a new man .
i'm sorry the old one couldn't tell you the truth , but i had to find out your part in all this .
is there a mrs. dyle?
yes , but we're divorced .
i thought that was peter joshua .
i'm just as difficult to live with as he was .
alex , how can you tell if anyone's lying or not?
you can't .
there must be some way .
there's an old riddle about two tribes of indians .
the whitefeet always tell the truth and the blackfeet always lie .
one day you meet an indian , you say ,
hey , indian , what are you , a truthful whitefoot or a lying blackfoot?
he says , " i'm a truthful whitefoot .
but which is he?
why couldn't you just look at his feet?
because he's wearing moccasins .
well , then , he's a truthful whitefoot , of course .
why not a lying blackfoot?
which one are you?
a truthful whitefoot .
come in .
sit down .
why?
do you wanna look at my feet?
yes .
uh ...
ohh .
hey , knock it off .
come on , reggie , listen to me .
here it comes , the fatherly talk .
you forget i'm already a widow .
so was juliet , at 15 .
but i'm not 15 .
well , that's your trouble ... you're too old for me .
can't you be serious?
oh !
you just said an horrible word .
what did i say?
serious .
when a man gets to be my age , that's the last word he ever wants to hear .
i don't want to be serious , and i especially don't want you to be .
okay , we'll just sit around all day being frivolous .
how about that , hmm?
reggie , cut it out .
okay .
now what are you doing?
cutting it out .
who told you to do that?
you did .
i'm not through complaining yet .
oh .
now cut it out .
alex , i think i love you .
hey , the telephone's ringing .
never mind .
whoever it is won't give up , and neither will i.
just a minute .
go on , take it .
hello .
i'm sorry , uh ...
i was just , uh ... nibbling on something .
say , i'd appreciate it mighty highly ... if you'd , uh , wiggle on over to room 46 and chew the fat for a spell .
give me one reason why i should .
yeah .
a little one , about six or seven .
keeps callin 'for aunt reggie .
ain't that cute?
they've got jean louis .
i'll be right there .
hey , tex , do somethin 'with this kid , will ya?
my leg's goin 'to sleep .
upsy daisy .
are you a real cowboy?
yeah , sure i am , kid .
so where's your gun?
will you put that thing away !
jean louis .
howdy , miz lampert .
who invited him?
well , herman , i see you had a happy landing .
i must call sylvie right away .
i'm afraid that'll have to wait , mrs. lampert .
it's his mother .
she won't be anybody's mother unless you answer some questions .
this ain't no game , miz lampert .
we want that money now .
why don't you keep quiet and stop threatening the child .
he hasn't got the money , and neither has mrs. lampert .
then who does?
i don't know , herman .
maybe you do .
me?
or you .
ohh !
or him .
why , that's the most ridiculous thing i ever ...
listen to this man .
man's gone loco .
now hold it .
suppose one of you found charles here in paris .
even bumped into him by accident , followed him when he tried to run out again , cornered him on the train , threw him out the window and , without bothering to tell the other two , took all the money for yourself .
if one of us did that , he wouldn't hang around waiting for the other two to figure it out .
but he'd have to .
don't you see?
if he left , he'd be admitting his guilt .
whoever it is has to wait here pretending to look for the money , waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home .
he's just tryin 'to throw us off .
they got it , i tell ya .
why don't we search their rooms?
that's all right with us .
then what are we wastin 'time for?
let's go .
while we're waiting , we'll search yours .
not my room !
well , herman .
you have something to hide?
then there are no objections .
all right , here's my key .
i'll take that .
my room's open .
everyone .
whoa .
come on .
now , you two just make yourselves to home here .
well , let's get busy .
come on , jean louis .
come on .
oh , that's fine .
who gets your vote?
scobie .
he's the one who objected .
all right , i'll take tex's room here and gideon's .
you take jean louis with you , and bolt the door from inside .
come on , jean louis .
we'll have a treasure hunt .
tex?
man , that's charlie's stuff .
looks like it .
think we ought to call herman?
what for?
if it's not here , why bother him?
and if it is?
why bother him?
oh .
what?
sure there's nothing missing here?
no , everything's here .
the police have kindly provided us with a list .
sure ain't nothin 'here worth no quarter of a million dollars .
not unless we're blind .
i keep telling myself we've stolen a great deal of money , but up to now i've yet to see a penny of it .
you think maybe we're fishin 'up the wrong stream?
meaning what?
suppose one of us has it .
you know , like the man says .
now , that'd be mighty distasteful , us bein 'veterans of the same war and all .
well , you know i'd tell you if i had it .
naturally .
just like i'd tell you if i had it .
naturally .
and that goes for herman too .
naturally .
he's all right , sylvie .
honestly .
just hurry over as soon as you can .
okay .
good bye .
now , if you had a treasure , where would you hide it?
i would bury it in the garden .
swell , but this man doesn't have a garden .
oh , neither do i.
you don't?
well , if you had to hide it in this room , where would you put it?
up there .
on top of that cupboard?
you know something?
you may be right .
oh , i hope i don't find any hairy little things living up here .
hey , there is something .
and it's heavy .
i found it !
i found it !
i found it !
if you think you're getting credit for this , you're crazy .
we won !
we won !
we won !
we won !
we won !
we won !
we won !
we found it !
we found it !
did you find it?
no .
what do you mean , no?
the kid was yellin '.
up there .
it's up there .
believe me , there's nothing up there .
yeah?
oh !
oh !
jumpin 'frijoles .
it's herman's spare .
where is he?
he's over in my room .
you'd better take the boy out in the hall .
oh , now , who would've done a mean thing like that?
i'm not quite sure .
well , this ain't my room .
mine neither .
oh , the police aren't going to like this a bit .
we could dry him off and take him down the hall to his own room .
he really doesn't look too bad .
oh , poor old herman .
seems like him and good luck always was strangers .
well , maybe now he'll meet up with his other hand someplace .
a man drowned in his bed?
impossible .
and in his pyjamas ... the second one in his pyjamas .
c'est trop stupide .
stop lying to me .
this nose tells me when you are lying .
it is never mistaken , not in 23 years .
this nose will make me commissaire of police .
mr. dyle , or mr. joshua ...
which is it?
dyle .
and yet you registered in megeve as mr. joshua .
didn't you know it was against the law to register under an assumed name?
no , i didn't .
it's done in america all the time .
none of you will be permitted to leave paris ... until this matter is cleared up .
only i warn you , i will be watching .
we use the guillotine in this country .
i have always suspected that the blade coming down ... causes no more than a slight tickling sensation ... on the back of the neck .
it is only a guess , of course .
i hope none of you ever finds out for certain .
who do you think did it?
gideon?
possibly .
or tex?
possibly .
you're a fat lot of help .
that's right .
can i have one of those?
what?
i think tex did it .
oh .
vanille et chocolat , s'll vous plait .
why do you think tex did it?
because i really suspect gideon , and it's always the person you don't suspect .
do women think it feminine to be so illogical , or can't they help it?
what's so illogical about that?
you just said it's always the one you don't suspect .
if you suspect gideon , therefore it must be tex .
on the other hand , if you suspect tex it must be the other fella , gideon .
i guess they just can't help it .
hmm?
who?
women .
oh .
you know , i can't help feeling rather sorry for scobie .
wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
what , like scobie?
no .
gene kelly .
you remember when he danced down here by the river in an american in paris ... without a care in the world?
mmm .
you know , this is good .
want some?
uh ...
ohh !
no , thanks .
i guess you don't either .
here , give me that .
i'm sorry .
alex , i'm scared .
yes , i know .
i can't think of any reason why he was killed .
well , perhaps someone thought that four shares were too many .
what makes you think that this someone is going to be satisfied with three?
he wants it all .
that means we're in his way too .
that's right .
we've got to do something .
i mean , any minute now we could be assassinated .
would you do anything like that?
what , assassinate someone?
no .
swing down from there on a rope to save the woman you love .
like the hunchback of notre dame .
uh ...
huh?
who put that there?
hurry up and change .
i'm starved .
let me know what you want to eat so i can pick out a suit that matches .
ha ha ha ha .
ah ah ah !
what do you want?
it's the house detective .
why don't you have a girl in there?
god , you're a pest .
can i come in?
no .
i'm going to take a bath .
wouldn't it be better if you did it in here?
what for?
well , i wouldn't want to use that tub .
anyway , i don't want to be alone .
i'm afraid .
you're only next door .
if anything happens , holler .
aaaah !
reggie?
got you .
ha ha .
did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
the shower's in there .
oh , come on , open the door .
this is a ludicrous situation .
i can think of a dozen men who are just longing to use my shower .
why don't you call one of them?
i dare you .
oh , you're a nut .
what are you doing?
taking off my shoes .
did you ever hear of anyone taking a shower with their shoes on?
i usually sing a medley of old favorites when i'm in the shower .
any requests?
shut the door .
i'm afraid i don't know that one , miss .
well ...
shut the door !
why?
come in and watch .
drip dry .
how often do you go through this little ritual?
oh , every day .
the manufacturer recommends it .
i don't believe it .
oh , yes , it's ...
wait a minute .
read the label .
look at the small print .
wearing this suit during washing ... helps protect its shape .
whoo !
ha ha !
waterproof .
ah ha ha ha ha .
wait .
acro nylon .
fibrous resistant .
plastic .
rustproof .
fireproof .
proof proof .
you're the nut .
nut proof !
yes?
mrs. lampert?
bartholomew .
i spoke to washington , mrs. lampert .
go ahead , mr. bartholomew .
i'm listening .
well , i told them what you said about this man being carson dyle's brother .
i asked them what they knew about it , and they told me .
you're not gonna like this , mrs. lampert .
carson dyle had no brother .
mrs. lampert?
are you sure there's no mistake?
none whatsoever .
please be careful , mrs. lampert .
bye .
i left all my drip dry dripping .
is that all right?
what's the matter?
is something wrong?
you're probably weak from hunger .
you've only eaten five times today .
i'll fix up my suit and take you out to dinner .
let's go somewhere crowded .
i feel like a lot of people .
hey , you know , this thing is still damp .
you haven't spoken a word for 20 minutes .
i was thinking about charles and scobie and who's going to be next .
me?
i don't suppose you know who the murderer is , do you?
no .
not yet .
whoever's left alive at the end will pretty much have sewn up the nomination .
what are you trying to say , that i might have killed charles and scobie?
what do i have to do to satisfy you?
become the next victim?
it's a start , anyway .
oh .
i can't understand you at all .
one minute you're chasing me around the shower room .
the next minute you're accusing me of murder .
carson dyle had no brother .
oh , i can explain that , if you'll just listen .
well , i can't very well leave without a pair of water wings , can i?
all right , get set for the story of my life .
fiction or nonfiction?
eh ...
why don't you shut up?
well !
are you going to listen?
go on .
all right .
now , when i was a young man my father expected me to go into his business .
umbrella frames .
that's what he made .
a sensible business , i suppose , but i didn't have the sense in those days to be sensible .
i suppose all this is leading somewhere .
well , it led me away from umbrella frames , for one thing .
but that left me without any honest means of support .
what do you mean?
well , in this highly competitive world , when a man has no profession there isn't much choice , so i began looking for people who had more money than they needed , including some they'd barely miss .
you mean , you're a thief?
well , that's not exactly the term i'd have chosen , but it sort of captures the spirit of the thing .
i don't believe it .
i can't really blame you now .
but i do believe it .
that's what i don't believe .
so it's good bye , alexander dyle , welcome home , peter joshua .
sorry .
the name's adam canfield .
adam canfield?
mm hmm .
wonderful .
you've had three names in the past two days .
i don't even know who i'm talking to anymore .
well , the man's the same , even if the name isn't .
no , he isn't .
adam canfield is a crook , and i want to know why .
well , it's simple .
i like what i do .
i enjoy my work .
there aren't many men who love their work as much as i do .
you look around sometime .
is there a mrs. canfield?
yes , but we're divorced .
" but we're divorced .
that's right .
now go and eat your dinner .
oh , i could eat a horse .
i think that's what you ordered .
don't you dare be civil with me , after leading me on like this .
how did i lead you on?
oh , all that marvelous rejection .
you knew i couldn't resist it .
now it turns out all you're interested in is the money .
that's right .
ohh !
well , what would you like me to say?
that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me ... than a quarter of a million dollars?
i don't suppose so .
it's a toss up , i can tell you that .
mmm ...
what?
hasn't it occurred to you that i'm having a tough time keeping my hands off you?
oh , you should see your face .
what's the matter with it?
it's lovely .
ohh .
now what's the trouble?
i'm not hungry anymore .
isn't it glorious?
adam !
it's all right .
come and look .
for her romeo came
and
it was closing night
the ending of
you don't look so bad in this light .
why do you think i brought you here?
maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work ... the competition was turning out .
pretty good , huh?
i taught them everything they do .
oh , did they do that kind of thing way back in your day?
sure .
how do you think i got here?
i hear it still
i always will
not allowed to kiss back , huh?
oh , no .
doctor said it was bad for my thermostat .
mm hmm .
charade
well , when you come on you come on , don't you?
well , come on .
yeah .
huh?
in the lobby?
are you out of your mind?
it's 3 : 30 in the morning .
you mean it?
ah choo !
all right .
all right , i'll be right down .
wait a minute .
h ...
h hey , turn on the lights !
hey , how do you stop this thing?
ah choo !
ah choo !
ah choo !
aaaaaah !
three of them , all in their pyjamas?
c'est ridicule .
what is it , some new american fad?
and now your friend who lives here , uh , the one from texas , he has disappeared into thin air .
where is he?
i wish i knew .
madame?
tell me , mr. dyle .
where were you at 3 : 30 a . m .?
in my room , asleep .
and you , mrs. lampert?
i was too .
in mr. dyle's room?
no , in my room .
obviously you're telling the truth , for why would you invent such a ridiculous story?
and if i were you , i wouldn't stay in my pyjamas .
good night .
well , that wraps it up .
tex has the money .
i'll let you know when i've found him .
you're gonna go looking for him now?
if the police find him first , they're not going to turn over that quarter of a million to us .
oh , adam ...
go to bed and bolt your door .
yeah?
now you listen to me , dyle .
i know who's got that money , man , and i want my share .
seems to be growin 'every day .
well , i ain't disappearin 'till i get it .
where are you , tex?
come on , man .
look , my mama didn't raise no stupid children .
i'll tell you what .
you wanna find me , you just look over your shoulder ,
'cause from now on i'm gonna be right behind you .
open up .
i think i was wrong about tex having the money .
why?
i just heard from him .
he's still hungry .
that means killing gideon didn't get it for him .
so he's narrowed it down to us .
you've got it .
but i've looked everywhere .
you know i have .
where's the airlines bag?
in the wardrobe .
get it .
lord , you're obstinate .
charles must have had it with him on the train when tex killed him .
thanks .
everybody and his aunt lillian's been through that bag , including me .
okay , we'll do it again .
i've been into it at least once a day .
somebody would have seen it .
it's there , reggie .
we're looking at it right now .
something on that bed is worth a quarter of a million dollars .
but what?
i don't know .
i don't know .
four passports .
no .
steamship ticket .
anything in there?
nothing .
wallet .
comb?
no .
a fountain pen .
what about that key?
to the apartment .
matches mine exactly .
well ...
i bet you don't really need those .
you need them .
this still doesn't make sense , but it isn't worth a quarter of a million dollars either .
wait a minute .
what?
the tooth powder .
what about it?
could you recognize heroin just by the taste of it?
heroin .
peppermint flavored heroin .
mmm .
well , i guess that's it .
dead end .
well , go to bed .
you've gotta go to work in the morning .
there's nothing more we can do tonight .
i love you , adam .
yes , you told me .
no .
the last time i said , " i love you , alex .
oh .
oh .
hold it .
they're recognizing great britain .
ooh , la vache .
mr. chairman , fellow delegates ... and my distinguished colleague from italy .
her majesty's delegation has listened with great patience to the southern european ...
oh , are you on?
no , it's all right .
what's wrong , adam?
nothing .
i think i've found something .
i was snooping around tex's room and came across this in the wastebasket .
i stuck it together again .
that's the receipt grandpierre gave me for charles 'things .
i don't see how that's going to ...
no , you're not looking .
when we went through the airlines bag , something was missing ... an agenda .
that's an appointment book , isn't it?
it wasn't there .
that's right .
i remember grandpierre looking through it , but there was nothing in it the police thought was very important .
can you remember anything in it?
well , it did say something about charles 'last appointment .
with who?
where?
i think it only said where .
come on , reggie , think .
this may be what we're looking for .
adam , that money doesn't belong to us .
if we keep it , we'll be breaking the law .
nonsense .
we didn't steal it .
there's no law against stealing stolen money .
of course there is !
there is?
when did they pass such a silly law?
now think , reggie .
what was in that appointment book?
a place or street corner or something .
watch it .
i'm on .
... of , of the western hemisphere conference ... ... of the western hemisphere conference ... held on march 22 ...
no , wait !
it was last thursday , 5 : 00 .
jardin des champs elysees .
that's it , adam !
the garden !
well , it's thursday today , and it's almost 5 : 00 , so come on .
it's all right , gentlemen .
carry on .
now what?
5 : 00 , thursday , the gardens .
must be something around here .
charles 'appointment was last week .
yes , i know , but this is all we've got left .
you're not kidding .
ten minutes ago i had a job .
now you've got another job , so stop grumbling and start looking .
i'll take that side .
you poke around over here .
it's hopeless .
i don't even know what we're looking for .
i don't think tex does either .
tex?
is he here?
look .
i'm going to see what he's up to .
you stay here .
be careful , adam .
he's already killed three men .
wait !
wait !
taxi !
back up .
all right , where's the letter?
the letter , huh?
it ain't worth nothin '.
you know what i mean .
the envelope with the stamps on it .
i want it .
you greenhorn .
why , you thick skulled , harebrained , half witted greenhorn .
and they was both too smart for us .
what are you talking about?
first her husband , now her?
she batted all of them big eyes at you ... and you fell for it like an egg from a tall chicken .
you want the envelope?
there .
you take it .
it's all yours .
you killed all three of 'em for nothin '!
you greenhorn !
you blockheaded jackass !
you are a nincompoop !
sylvie !
what are you doing here?
i'm waiting for jean louis .
oh .
what's he up to?
he was so excited when he got the stamps you gave him this morning .
he said he'd never seen any like them .
i'm glad .
what's all this?
the stamp market .
it's there every thursday afternoon .
that's where jean louis trades his stamps .
good lord , where is he?
what's the matter , cherie?
the stamps !
they're worth a fortune !
what?
a fortune !

jean louis , thank heaven .

a man gave me all those for only three .
a man?
oh , no , jean louis .
who?

vite , mon cheri .
vite .
la bas .
come on !
oh , but he's gone .
i don't blame him .
entrez .
monsieur felix?
oui .
i was expecting you .
i knew you would come .
look at them , madame .
have you ever , in your entire life , seen anything so beautiful?
i'm sorry .
i don't know anything about stamps .
i know them as one knows his own face , though i had never seen them .
this one , a swedish four shilling ... called da gula fyraskillingen , printed in 1854 .
what is it worth?
oh , the money is unimportant .
i'm afraid it's very important .
well , in your money , perhaps $85, 000 .
may i sit down?
yes .
and the blue one?
oh , it's called the hawaiian blue .
in 1894 the owner was murdered by a rival collector ... who was obsessed to own it .
and what is its value today?
sixty five thousand .
and the last one .
ah , the best for last .
le chef d'oeuvre de la collection .
the masterpiece .
the most valuable stamp in the world .
it's called the gazette maldave .
it was printed by hand on colored paper ... and marked with the initials of the printer .
today it has a value of $100000 .
i'm not a thief , madame .
i knew there was some mistake .
you gave the boy a great many stamps in return .
are they for sale now?
let me see .
three hundred and fifty european ; two hundred asian ; a hundred and seventy five american ; a hundred african ; and 12 princess grace commemorative .
which comes to ten francs .
and don't forget these .
thank you .
i'm sorry .
oh , no .
for a few minutes they were mine .
that is enough .
adam?
adam?
hello?
mr. bartholomew?
yes .
tex is dead .
smothered .
and adam did it .
he killed them all .
are you sure?
yes , i'm sure .
tex wrote the word " dyle " before he died .
he's the murderer , i tell you .
wait a minute , mrs. lampert .
you'd better give that to me again .
it was the stamps on the letter charles had with him on the train .
they were in plain view all the time , but no one looked at the envelope .
mrs. lampert , listen to me .
you're not safe as long as you have these stamps .
let's see .
do you know the center garden at the palais royale?
the colonnade?
yes , by the colonnade .
as fast as you can get there .
hurry , mrs. lampert .
i'm leaving right away .
reggie !
the stamps !
where are they?
reggie !
wait !
so you can kill me too?
tex is dead .
he wrote " dyle " on the carpet .
i'm not dyle .
you know that .
but tex didn't know it .
you're a murderer .
reggie , i want those stamps !
palais royale , vite .
mais je suis occupe .
mais c'est tres urgent .
occupe .
whoa !
billet !
ohh !
american embassy .
american embassy?
uh , mr. bartholomew's office , please .
would you speak a little louder , please .
i can't speak any louder .
mr. hamilton bartholomew .
i'm sorry .
mr. bartholomew has left for the day .
but someone's trying to kill me .
what?
kill me !
you've got to get word to him right away .
he's in the center garden of the palais royale near the colonnade .
tell him i'm trapped in a phone booth right below him in the metro station .
the name's lampert .
hello?
hello .
mr. bartholomew?
yes .
there was a call for you just now , mr. bartholomew .
it sounded quite urgent .
a mrs. lampert .
lampert?
i don't know any mrs. lampert .
she says she's trapped in a metro station and someone's trying to kill her .
trying to kill her?
who does she think i am , the c. i. a.?
all right , i guess you'd better call the french police .
mr. bartholomew !
mr. bartholomew !
help me !
reggie !
stop !
that man is carson dyle .
we all know carson dyle is dead , mrs. lampert .
i tell you , he's carson dyle .
now , you're not gonna believe him .
bring those stamps over here .
he's trying to trick you again .
tex recognized him .
that's why he wrote dyle .
if you take him those stamps , he'll kill you too .
mrs. lampert !
if i'm who he says i am , what's preventing me from killing you right now?
because he'd have to come out to get the stamps , and he knows he'd never make it .
mrs. lampert , he wants the money for himself .
that's all he's ever wanted .
he's with the c. i. a. i saw him at the embassy .
i tell you , he's carson dyle .
that's right , mrs. lampert .
that's right .
i'm a dead man .
look at me .
oh , i don't know who anybody is .
reggie , i beg you .
just trust me once more .
why should i?
i can't think of a reason in the world why you should .
stop , mrs. lampert , or i'll kill you !
it won't get you the stamps , dyle .
you'll still have to come out , and i'm not likely to miss at this range .
maybe not , but it takes a lot of bullets to kill me .
they left me there with five in my legs and my stomach .
they knew i was alive , but they left me there .
i spent ten months in a german prison camp with nothing to stop the pain .
they left me there .
they deserved to die .
but i had nothing to do with it .
you've got the money now .
it belongs to me .
mrs. lampert , they knew i was still alive , but they left me there .
that's why i had to kill them , all four of them .
please believe me .
i'll kill you too .
it won't make any difference .
it's no use .
you're running out of time .
i've come too far to turn back .
i swear , i'll kill you !
make up your mind , mrs. lampert .
now .
adam !
all right .
i know you're in there , mrs. lampert .
come on out .
do you hear me?
come on out !
i don't want to kill you , but i will .
come on out .
the game is over , mrs. lampert .
aaaaah !
you didn't have to chase me so hard .
that one's done .
do this one .
oh .
i'm sorry i thought you were the murderer , but how was i to know he was as big a liar as you are?
is that all the gratitude i get for saving your hide?
rub your own blinking foot .
was it my hide , or those stamps?
what a terrible thing to say .
how could you think that?
then prove it to me .
tell me to go to the embassy first thing in the morning and turn in those stamps .
i said , tell me to go to the embassy first ...
i heard you , i heard you .
then say it .
now , reggie , listen to me .
there's something i'd like to explain .
never mind .
i'll go by myself .
what makes you think they're even interested?
it's only a quarter million .
it'll cost more than that for them to fix their bookkeeping .
now , as a taxpayer ...
who's a taxpayer?
crooks don't pay taxes .
excuse me , soldier ...
marine , ma'am .
forgive me .
who would i see regarding the return of stolen government money?
you might try the treasury department .
room 217 , second floor , mr. cruikshank .
217 .
thank you , marine .
uh , do you mind if i don't go in with you?
the sight of all that money being given away might make me break out .
mr. cruikshank , please .
my name is lampert .
yes .
mr. cruikshank?
a miss lamp ...
mrs.
mrs. lampert to see you .
yes , sir .
go right in .
thank you .
of all the mean , rotten , contemptible , crooked ...
crooked?
i should think you'd be glad to find out i'm not crooked .
you can't even be honest about being dishonest .
why didn't you say something?
we're not allowed to tell .
come on , give me the stamps .
mm mmm .
wait .
how did dyle get an office in this building?
when did you meet him?
what time of day , i mean .
about 1 : 00 .
the lunch hour .
probably worked it out in advance .
found an office usually left open and moved in for the time you were here .
then how do i know this is your office?
mrs. foster , take a memo to bartholomew in security recommending ...
bartholomew !
recommending that embassy offices be kept locked during the lunch hour .
mmm .
starting with his own .
give me the stamps .
come on .
what's your first name today?
brian .
brian cruikshank .
serves me right if i get stuck with that one .
who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
is there a mrs. cruikshank?
yes .
but we're divorced .
no .
oh .
my mother .
she lives in detroit .
you'd like her .
she'd like you too .
come on , give me those stamps .
not until you prove to me that you're really brian cruikshank .
next week i'll put it on a marriage license .
how about that?
quit stalling .
i want some identification now .
i wouldn't lie on a license .
you can't prove it .
you're still trying to ...
marriage license "?
did you say " marriage license "?
don't change the subject .
just give me the stamps .
oh , i love you , adam , alex , peter , brian , whatever your name is .
oh , i love you .
i hope we have a lot of boys .
we can name them all after you .
well , before we start that , may i have the stamps?
