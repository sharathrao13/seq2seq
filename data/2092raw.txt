honey?
frank?
what's the matter? ls he kicking again?
no , it's time .
you always make me feel so ....
you're awful .
let's get ready , okay?
okay .
honey , you'd better go wake up chris .
come on , i got your number .
come on .
attaboy .
dad , what time is it?
you know what time .
it's time to get up .
i have to drop you off at charley's house .
you'll have to go to school from there .
why?
i wonder why .
i don't know .
ls mom having the baby?
yes , that's a trick she does rather well every 1 1 years .
i guess so .
why don't you get dressed?
don't forget your books .
okay .
dad , can anything happen to her?
i saw on tv in a movie once where the mother died .
you know something?
things like that happened a long time ago .
they just don't happen that way anymore .
she had you , didn't she?
yeah .
look at the size of you , you big ox .
okay , now .
let's get ready .
attaboy .
why can't i go with you and dad to the hospital?
we'd love to have you there ... but the doctors simply don't allow little boys in hospitals .
i could have my tonsils out again .
you'd be there for a week , and we'd be home in three days .
you young whippersnappers , you're not like the old team ... out with old mr. dunston in the plains and prairie , driving those cattle ... getting their tonsils out in the middle of the night with no doctors .
you're not a chip off the old block .
they're scouts .
maybe charley won't like having me around .
charley won't like having you around?
charley only sees his own boys two sundays a month , and he loves kids .
you young whippersnapper , kiss your mother goodbye .
listen , we'll both give you a call ... as soon as we find out whether you've got a baby sister or a baby brother .
i don't care what it is as long as you're okay .
and you give me one of the puppies .
honey , your books .
bye , charley .
okay , lenore .
good luck to you .
call me , frank .
let's go and whip up some french toast .
i'm having my baby .
nurse , know what they call them?
ln lreland , my mother used to call them ... the wee cuddies and the wee cubs .
i mean , where can you get that?
boy , i hope i have one like that .
sir , would you please come to the labor room now?
it's time to go back to the labor room .
the labor room?
yes , this way .
how did you know about the wee cuddies and the wee cubs?
i learned about them a long time ago .
do you speak gaelic?
are you lrish?
no , scottish .
but i do speak gaelic .
you do speak gaelic?
this way , please .
an lrish and a gaelic .
an lrish and scottish lass .
hang on to my hand , honey .
i'm not very brave .
this little guy's going to kill me .
maybe i'll get a doctor .
no .
he's just different than chris , that's all .
i tried to talk to the doctor .
i just couldn't make him understand .
it seems like it's different .
i think you'd better get the nurse .
nurse , hurry up , please .
you'd better go to the waiting room .
just a minute , please .
i love you .
i'm glad we decided to have the baby .
aren't you , sweetheart?
we both want it .
don't worry about a thing .
it's not going to tie you down , is it , sweetheart?
you going to feel trapped like you did last time?
calm down .
take a deep breath .
i am !
try to relax .
take a deep breath .
you got something to stir the coffee with?
use that .
i've been using it for the past three hours .
after a while , you get used to the taste of lead in your coffee .
there's an overabundance of lead in all the things we eat nowadays .
we're slowly but surely poisoning ourselves , you know that?
fine world to bring a kid into , fellows .
i can cite examples
you don't have to lecture us .
just look at that smog out the window .
what's the difference if we breathe it or eat it?
maybe we'll learn to adapt to it .
i'm an exterminator .
we service the beverly hills westwood area .
here's my card .
i'm not trying to drum up business or anything .
the point is that years back we developed this spray ... to kill roaches and other household pests .
all we ended up doing is creating a new breed of roaches .
ls that right?
bigger , stronger , and harder to kill .
listen , you want to play poker?
five card draw?
might as well .
let's clear some of this stuff away and get going .
i just hope my wife isn't going to have any trouble .
she did the last baby in 45 minutes .
no kidding .
that's a fact .
i thought they said the second one came faster .
you got nothing to complain about .
my wife's been in labor for six hours .
son of a bitch of a thing stole my 50 cents .
here's your 50 cents .
come on , sit down .
read a magazine or something .
you know what's the biggest problem in beverly hills?
snails .
snails and slugs .
they can wipe out a lawn in just a few weeks .
folks feel sorry for them .
they're not like your usual pest .
folks hate to see all them snails laying on their lawns , dead .
snails and slugs and bugs .
any of you guys in a happier profession?
i think we've got a really effective anesthetic .
we'll check you before we really do anything .
i heard  you're doing just great .
just relax .
it's really been different than chris .
you've done your share .
we'll do ours now .
she's fully dilated .
the head's on the perineum .
something's wrong .
i know something's wrong .
it's nothing really wrong , honey .
it's just a very big baby .
it's going to be fine , but i need your help .
i know something's wrong .
how big was your last baby?
7 pounds , 4 ounces .
i told you that this baby was different than chris .
this baby is just gigantic .
it's probably 10 pounds , 10 . 5 pounds , maybe even 1 1 pounds .
it's got a gigantic head .
but she's got a big pelvis and plenty of relaxation .
i'm trying to cooperate !
all right , relax .
this is just immense .
we're just putting forceps on the baby's head .
just breathe deep .
don't push .
just pant .
we're just easing the baby out .
i know , but it's ....
all right .
now we just cut you .
you didn't feel that , did you?
no .
okay , fine .
the baby will be out in just about 30 seconds .
davis , wait !
what does my baby look like?
what's wrong with my baby?
doctor !
mr. davis , out of here !
how's my baby?
the umbilical cord's been severed , but not surgically .
it looks like it's been chewed off .
where's the baby?
get off of me !
get your hands off !
orderly !
lenore !
come on , let's go !
let me go !
everything's going to be all right .
my wife isn't !
tell me my baby's not dead .
don't touch me .
don't you touch me .
they've stolen my baby .
i don't want my baby to be dead .
tell me my baby isn't dead .
please .
i assure you , mrs. davis , your baby is very much alive .
thank you .
we located a broken skylight on the third floor .
blood and excess tissue on the roof .
lieutenant , what's it look like to you?
something small .
doctor .
she's coming out of sedation now .
lenore , can you hear me , darling?
somebody might have abducted our baby , and i'm holding this hospital responsible .
that hole in the skylight isn't large enough for a full sized human being .
there's no other way out of that delivery room .
the doctor's correct .
let's not discuss it , lieutenant .
i've asked your husband to submit to some tests .
and i've refused .
you've never been exposed to radioactivity and radioactive material ...
or undergone extensive x rays?
no , doctor .
i told you .
we can't rule out genetic damage .
i noticed that you did inquire about abortion eight months ago .
doesn't everybody inquire about it nowadays?
it's just a question of convenience , and we decided to have the baby .
we all make mistakes .
i apologize for that crack .
let me talk to you outside .
come on .
you're not afraid of me , are you?
i've always been afraid of you , especially those eyes .
i wanted a boy so badly .
i think he was probably very frightened .
you know , he's different .
i think he was probably afraid they were going to hurt him .
sweetheart .
he's not ugly .
you're so exhausted , sweetheart .
you don't know what you're saying .
i'm going to check up on those two .
i don't trust them .
can you imagine?
can you imagine those guys , trying to blame us?
we are the parents , sweetheart .
i'll be right back .
okay .
dr. norton has decided your wife can go home .
first thing in the morning .
of course , you realize ... it's in everyone's interest to keep this quiet for the time being .
at least , until we can find out what's become of the infant .
you've heard no word about it?
no .
i don't see how it could survive the night without clothing and nourishment .
of course , like any animal  it's not an animal , doctor .
you know that very well .
whatever it is , you can't classify it as an animal .
it's human , doctor .
that's what's disgusting to you , isn't it?
it kills like an animal .
and when we find it , we'll have to destroy it like one .
i don't care .
i suppose you have to do what's necessary .
i'm glad you feel that way .
i only hope your wife understands , as well .
what's there to understand?
it's better not to think about it .
why don't i say goodnight to your wife , and maybe i'll drive you home .
no , thanks .
okay , darling , i'll see you in the morning .
stay on this floor .
<i>police still offer no explanation for the series of five deaths ... </ i> <i>which occurred early today ... </ i> <i>at the st. george medical center in santa monica . </ i>

the bastards !
they named us .
barbara , would you come here for a minute , please?
yes , sir?
i'm picking up my wife at the hospital tonight .
so can you reschedule that dinner for tomorrow evening?
i think that mr. clayton wanted to talk to you .
and about the marcus affair ....
i think we can have those cocktails at 6 : 30 at the hilton tomorrow .
he wants to approve the campaign by the end of the week .
i think you'd better see mr. clayton now .
i'll be right back .
come on in .
all right , bob .
you must be exhausted .
eaten anything?
get frank a couple of poached eggs on an english muffin ... with a side of canadian bacon ... and a tall glass of freshly squeezed orange juice .
that should do the trick .
i don't want you collapsing on me .
frank , don't let it get you down .
these things happen .
at least , that's what they say .
who's " they "?
i spoke to the hospital .
they give you information?
i got connections over there .
i'm the vice chairman of the fundraising committee .
lf there's anything i can do for you
no , thanks , bob .
i'm getting her out of there myself tonight .
you think that's wise?
barbara said you wanted to rap with me .
yeah , frank .
you've accrued three weeks vacation .
you think it would be a good idea if you took it now?
i can't , bob .
i've got the marcus account and the sturbridge campaign .
i'm just bogged down in work .
besides , i need to work , bob .
it keeps my mind off things .
frank , we're running a public relations business here .
our job is creating an image .
right now , you're a little controversial .
our clients want their pr men to be anonymous .
maybe after a little while , when you're less of a celebrity ....
you're not taking those accounts away from me , are you?
i mean , not now .
at the last minute?
these things happen , frank .
you know o'connors down in accounting?
he's got a retarded kid .
lnsists on keeping him in the house , too .
nobody thinks a thing of that .
nobody blames him .
we're not talking about a retarded kid , and you know it .
we're talking about a monstrosity of some kind .
maybe we'd better not talk about that .
i wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy .
it's just that i don't know what to do , bob .
how to behave .
and they're ... putting microphones in my face .
they're asking me questions i don't understand .
what you need is a good public relations firm ... to handle all of that for you .
that's very funny .
this is all going to be all right , isn't it ... when whatever this thing is is dead , right?
maybe it already is .
why don't you go down the service elevator?
you won't have to meet all those media people .
take care .
have them empty out his desk , send his personal articles to his house .
he won't be coming back .
mr. davis , what did it look like?
leave me alone .
i got nothing to say .
get those cameras out of my face , please .
i got no comment .
i had nothing to do with this .
will you get that goddamn thing out of my face?
get out of the way !
i don't know what it looks like .
never mind my baby .
leave my wife out of it , understand?
aren't we almost home?
we'll be there in a few minutes .
i feel better already getting out of that terrible place .
i don't have to take any more shots , do l?
i don't like taking shots .
i don't like being made to go to sleep .
i engaged nurses in three shifts .
i'm surprised anybody would even want to work for us .
dr. norton took care of it .
good .
and i'm going to be there all the time .
what about
i told the office i had to have those three weeks vacation they owe me .
what about that marcus account?
that was very important to you .
you're more important .
what about chris?
have you told him?
does he know anything?
i spoke to charley .
he kept him home from school .
he hasn't told him anything .
good .
sooner or later , he'll switch on the television .
there's only so long you can keep a secret like that .
dad , why can't i go to school , or go out , or have any of my friends over?
chris , i can't tell you now , son .
you'll just have to trust me .
<i> you trust me , don't you , son?
sure , dad . </ i>
you have to spend all your time with charley this week .
you wouldn't mind that .
chris , you don't want to hurt his feelings .
i like charley , but i want to see mom and the baby .
<i> the baby's not home yet .
ls it sick? </ i>
that's right , son .
the baby's sick .
and everything here is a mess .
so it'd be much better if you stay where you are .
will you tell charley to let me watch television?
<i> okay , put him on .
yeah , okay . </ i>
okay , frank , we'll take care of everything .
i had an idea .
what if i take chris up to the lake , do some fishing?
okay , charley .
thank you .
and give my love to lenore .
thanks , charley .
hunting and killing babies doesn't seem to be my specialty .
so what do you want , a transfer?
my wife's in her eighth month .
ever since i started on this , she hasn't been getting any rest .
me being so involved really brings it home .
besides , i guess you know we lost our last baby .
you're lucky you don't have grown kids nowadays .
people without children don't realize how lucky they are .
it'll make you feel much better .
did you see it , mrs. davis?
surely you must have gotten one glimpse .
they say it has teeth and claws .
did you know that?
how should i know that?
were you aware that it killed another person just last night?
a musician over on santa monica boulevard .
he was on his way home from work about 2 : 00 a . m ... and that was the last anybody saw of him .
they found him in an alley .
they can't be sure that it was ....
there's no doubt about it .
the wounds are the same as the doctor and nurses suffered .
what do you want me to say?
just say anything you feel .
what's under that napkin?
there's nothing there .
a recorder !
a tape recorder !
i'm a nurse .
you can tell me anything .
who are you working for?
i really am a registered nurse , and i write a little on the side .
she's taking interviews on a tape recorder .
get out .
we have to get rid of everybody .
let's not have any more nurses , honey .
all right .
we'll let them all go .
should have known better ... than to trust anybody .
actually , already in excess of $100, 000 ... has been allocated by the university ... for examination of this phenomenon .
we have some of the leading men in the field .
and it is hoped that this might lead to a breakthrough ... to a better understanding of why mutations occur .
you want to experiment on it , is that it?
ln fact , my department has already cautioned the police ... about excessive violence .
lf it could be dispatched with a bullet , or better still , some kind of a gas ....
undoubtedly , it is very small and any kind of bodily harm ... especially from gunshots or explosives ....
ln other words , you want me to sign away the body , is that it?
it's your right .
after all , you are the child's father .
it's not my child .
that's very wise .
to disassociate yourself emotionally .
just sign each copy , please .
pen?
give him a pen .
it seems that out of every tragedy , out of every evil ... some good can come , if we only apply ourselves .
i suppose that's going to be in all the medical journals ... the history books .
the davis child .
the davis monster .
it's like frankenstein .
ln my opinion , this will be remembered long after each of us is forgotten .
when i was a kid , i always thought the monster was frankenstein .
karloff walking around in these big shoes , grunting .
i thought he was frankenstein .
then i went to high school and read the book ... and i realized that ...
frankenstein was ... the doctor who created him .
somehow , the identities ... get all mixed up , don't they?
one must not allow oneself to be impressed by escapist fiction .
you forgot one .
pen .
frank , darling .
hi , darling .
mrs. davis , i don't suppose you took the pills i gave you?
you really should .
maybe it's all the pills i've been taking over the years that brought this on .
you really shouldn't be downstairs .
maybe you'd both like to have dinner with us .
i have some wonderful lamb chops in the refrigerator .
no , i'm afraid not .
honey , why don't you go down to the basement ... and get a bottle of that nice beaujolais?
won't that go nicely with the lamb chops?
we have quite an extensive wine cellar .
it's one of frank's many hobbies .
my husband's a many faceted man .
i'll show these gentlemen to the door .
i'll get that wine .
great .
good .
that basement's filthy .
how long has she been taking birth control pills before this pregnancy?
thirty one months .
you realize ... that i came from the east specifically for this matter?
i realize that it is a police problem ... but once the thing is killed , it becomes a medical problem .
now , you are in charge of that department , no doubt?
yes , i suppose so .
nobody knows how this thing happened .
it's really a matter of speculation , and i think perhaps that's for the best .
after all , if we find out ... that the cause is medication that we manufacture ... and it was administered over a long period of time ... it'd be bad for you and worse for us .
we're susceptible to lawsuits .
people will think the government hadn't tested and approved of those products ... that we put out on the market .
what do your interests recommend?
absolute destruction of this thing .
but we've already signed over the remains to the university .
but if there was nothing left of it , you know ... we would be most grateful to you .
you have had a very successful career ... until this freak incident .
it could work out for the best .
we have an opening ... on the board of our research and development department .
we wouldn't want people to lose faith in us , would we?
<i> hello?
dr. norton , please . </ i>
dr. norton's stepped out for a moment .
may i take a message?
<i>tell him they've cornered the infant at the hawthorne school ... </ i> <i>in west los angeles . </ i>
that's just a few blocks from here .
<i>ask the doctor to get over there if he can .
thank you . </ i>
i have to go out .
all right .
you don't mind staying alone?
i'll keep everything warm .
wait a minute , i'm frank davis .
i want to see lt. perkins .
all right .
take him .
wonder what's the matter with him .
screwed up genes or something .
wait here .
davis , how the hell did you find out about this?
there was a phone call for dr. norton .
i took the message .
my son , chris , goes to school here .
i've been here a million times , pta meetings .
your kid goes here?
sure , that's right .
he's in the sixth grade .
probably just a coincidence .
look , perkins , i want this thing destroyed as much as anybody else .
i realize that .
yeah , you realize .
then why is everybody looking at me?
like it's my own flesh and blood or something .
well , it's not !
you understand?
it's no relation to me !
nobody is looking at you .
say , you have my deepest sympathy .
you and your wife .
ls it all right if your driver drops me off a block from my home?
i don't want my wife to see me .
you don't want her to know you were here tonight?
i don't think she'd know how to take it .
i don't know .
maybe i didn't do the right thing .
i was just trying to show everybody i feel the same way they do .
i'm no different from anybody else .
we know that .
i got a boy 1 1 years old .
he's perfectly healthy , brilliant in school .
mr. davis , you don't have to keep telling us that .
we realize that .
look , i got to go back on duty .
take him wherever he wants to go .
davis said his kid went to this school .
why , in all of los angeles , would it happen to show up here?
maybe it's looking for somebody .
i'd like us to all get together again and be a family .
i'm really trying very hard , frank .
i can see that .
wouldn't it be a great idea to bring chris home?
he's better off where he is .
lenore , did you go out?
for christ's sakes , answer me .
are you feeling better?
where the hell have you been?
i've been straightening  i've been calling you .
been all over the house , straightening up .
where?
you weren't downstairs , and you didn't hear me calling you?
honey , there's a good movie on tonight .
it's with paul newman .
i gotta get something in my stomach .
excuse me .
chris come back here today?
i said , has chris been back here today?
i don't know .
why do you say that?
you wouldn't lie to me?
i know you wanted chris to come back , but i specifically told you ....
chris , are you hiding someplace?
don't fool around now .
i wish somebody would respect my feelings around here .
why are you watching that stuff?
i thought you wanted to watch a movie .
who are you calling?
please don't call anybody !
<i>how's chris? </ i>
i've had a hell of a time keeping him away from the newscasts and the daily papers .
but the teacher sent some schoolwork , so he's been keeping busy .
you've been with him all the time , then?
what are you talking about?
we just went fishing .
he hasn't been out of my sight for a minute .
you want to talk to him?
no , i don't want to talk to him .
hi , dad , when can i come home?
chris , did you come back here today?
ls the baby home from the hospital yet?
did i do anything wrong?
how about something to eat?
i'm not hungry .
i want to go to bed .
i'm sorry , charley .
i'm not mad at you .
that's okay , kid .
honey , i want you to make love to me .
i want you to hold me and love me .
you know , there are other ways .
come on , sweetheart .
there's no ice in there .
i'll get the ice .
wait a minute .
oh , my god .
what were you doing down in the basement?
you know .
what're you going to do?
what're you doing?
why are you so anxious to be the one to do it?
who is it?
mom?
dad?
frank , wait .
he could have killed you when you were sleeping !
he could have killed you .
you know why he didn't?
hello .
he knows you're his father .
no , you're crazy .
he knows .
he does .
he knows you're his father .
don't worry .
don't be scared .
i'll protect you .
it's a boy , you know .
it's a boy .
i'll protect you .
chris , look out .
i hit it .
i'm sure i hit it .
charley , look out !
come on , get back !
did you see it?
what does it look like?
it's no relation to us , chris .
it can't be .
see what your baby did to charley .
what did you do?
tell him about the doctors in the hospital !
lenore , take my son upstairs .
your dad was trying to suffocate your little brother .
he just wants to ....
you should have called us ... as soon as you began to suspect it was somewhere near the house .
it's lost a lot of blood .
it's my opinion that our troubles are very nearly over .
so shall we go?
and leave some men here ... in case it decides to double back to the house .
i would like to go with you .
haven't you done enough already?
no .
not yet .
you have to be the one to do it , don't you?
have you seen it?
got a real good look at it?
it was too dark .
it wouldn't matter .
i could do it .
you may have done it already , if it doesn't stop bleeding .
will you excuse us for a moment , please?
wait a second .
we just can't take  i advise you to let him come along .
after all , it found its way home by itself .
and it may be that it will search out its father ... especially now that he put a bullet in it .
what have we got to lose?
one more life .
you know how to use a gun?
beg your pardon?
do you know how to use a rifle?
sure .
we'll issue you one for your own protection .
okay .
<i>the shots that wounded the infant were fired not by the police ... </ i> <i>but by its father . </ i>
