you'ii know when that is .
i had a dream iast night .

paolo always said ...
we cannot choose where we are born ... " ... but we can choose where we iive , and where we die .
i wrote this for you , paolo .
your eyes were the colour of water .
yes , you are the water .
they were transparent iike the air .
you are the air now .
you are the sky .
your skin was baked by the sun ... " ... iike the kenyan earth you loved so much .
you are this red dry dust now .
forever , paolo .
you have become everything .
sveva .
she is very happy .
he's iit a fire there every night since paolo died .
kuki , for once in your iife just hear us out .
please?
when i go back to italy ... ... i want you and the children to come home .
you have the baby to think of now , kuki , as weii as emanuele .
i know you think i didn't believe in you when you and paolo came out here ... ... and i was afraid for you .
and maybe i didn't believe in you .
but i was wrong .
and coming here has brought out the best in you ... ... and i love seeing it .
but how could you run this place alone?
now , with a new baby ... ... and paolo gone?
soon ema wiii go away to coilege .
you'ii have no one .
please?
let me take care of you .
see the egg?
paolo put a secret in it .
a message .
sveva , iook .
poachers are coming into oi ari nyiro .
they're kiiling the animals .
this is not my concern .
the animals on my iand are my concern .
they are my responsibility .
children of my people who go without food are mine .
of course your children must be fed .
that's the most important thing .
but this kiiling must stop .
your people are great warriors .
i need men iike them to help us keep guard at night .
okay , boys , iet's try again .
load .
aim !
pick your target .
fire !
don't insult my inteiligence with excuses , emanuele .
there is no excuse .
i said , " no poisonous snakes !
i've said it a dozen times !
they're dangerous if you don't know how to handle them .
i don't care !
no more !
look at me when i'm talking to you !
do you hear me?
do you hear me?
i know what i'm doing .
and i'm not afraid iike you are .
how can you say that to me?
there are risks and then there's stupidity .
dear god , you've got a iittle sister here .
nothing wiii happen to sveva .
paolo would say what i'm saying .
you know he would .
ema , please .
don't do this .
stanford .
i'm in .
paolo would be so proud of you .
i'm not going .
i'm not ieaving you .
when we first came here ... ... i put a plant in the soil ... ... i was iucky if it grew .
i didn't know how .
i didn't know anything .
we think we run this place but we don't .
it runs us .
any farm's iike that , i guess .
we solve each problem , but we never get ahead .
stanford's not going to teach me how to run a ranch in kenya .
you want to do more than run this ranch , a iot more , and you know it .
you have to go away , so you can come back ... ... or we'ii have no future here .
it's karen's birthday .
in a few days , there'll be a going away party for ema .
he leaves for stanford next week .
since paolo's death ... ... just having ema here has been a great comfort .
and now he is going halfway around the world .
hey , everyone , it's a python .

only yesterday morning ... " ... we were iaughing together .
today , i am here with your friends to bury you .
to bury a husband was hard .
to bury my son is against nature ... " ... and a pain which words cannot teil .
you died knowing you were dying , but you were not afraid .
you were 17 but wise beyond your age ...
... and now you know the answer to aii questions .
i wiii iook for you .
i wiii iook for you always .
i wiii see you in every flower ...
... in every bird ...
... in every sunset ...
... in every crawling snake .
everything of beauty wiii forever be you , emanuele .
anything young and proud .
anything good and strong .
for us who are ieft ...
... remains to wonder at the reason for such waste .
where has aii this love gone?
i hope your journey has been good ... " ... because you have already arrived .
fly for me , bird of the sun .
fly high .
i love you so .
load .
aim .
fire .
load .
aim .
fire .
goodbye .
i love you .
i love you .
may i come back soon?
i wish you would .
bless you .
finally , all we can do is to let the days instruct us ... ... and know that the only gift worth having is the grace to go on with the job ... ... to be done , the people to love ... ... and knowing what we love we can never lose .
there is no holding on in this world .
we came to this extraordinary place ... ... and africa let us lead extraordinary lives .
then africa claimed an extraordinary price .
that was africa's privilege .
and now it is my privilege to look after africa herself .
