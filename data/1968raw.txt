25 . 000
the current spell of icy weather has claimed its first victim .
a motorcyclist froze to death on highway 4 and drove for a further 90 km after he was dead .
two patrolmen flagged him down and as he didn't react they pursued him .
they drove alongside and rebuked him for his attitude .
as he didn't move they realized something was wrong .
it seems incredible .
it's a wonderful image .
a dead young man drives his motorcycle across the icy plain , escorted by two patrolmen .
where was he going in that icy dawn?
to see someone who couldn't wait until the morning .
there's a story here !
i'll cut it out and keep it , it might inspire me .
i'll get it .
hello .
hello .
what is it?
i'm an actor .
i'm looking for enrique goded .
he isn't here .
but i can see him , man .
in any case , we don't have any projects , so ...
i'd like to speak to him .
we were old pals at school .
i'm ignacio rodrguez .
all right , come in .
thank you .
i don't think he'll see you .
that's all right .
wait a minute .
he's an actor , a nuisance !
i told him we aren't preparing a film now .
tell him i'm not in .
i did , but he saw you .
and i can see him .
he said he was a friend of yours at school .
who can he be?
ignacio rodrguez .
ignacio?
it can't be !
that's what he said .
ignacio , is it really you?
of course , enrique !
i'm delighted you remember me !
how could i forget you?
well , it's been sixteen years .
that long?
more or less .
i wouldn't recognize you with that beard .
you'd look better without it .
come into my office .
you want a coffee?
no , thanks .
i'm having one .
then , yes .
martn , will you make some coffee?
yes .
sit down .
what brings you here?
i came to ask for work .
i'm an actor .
i've brought you my resume .
bumblebee group .
an independent theater company .
el retablillo de san cristbal " by garca lorca ,
the diary of adam and eve " by mark twain ...
mark twain , garca lorca ...
only the best for the bumblebee .
don't you write anymore?
no , i stopped ages ago .
but i've brought my last story .
the visit
by the way , when are you starting your next film?
well ...
i'll do anything .
we're eyeing tabloids to see if i can think of stories .
you've caught me in a creative crisis .
that's a bummer !
read my story , it might give you some ideas .
what's it about?
our school .
one part is based on our childhood , and the other part isn't , when the characters grow up .
that's fiction .
i haven't introduced you .
ignacio , martn .
pleased to meet you .
sugar and milk?
yes , please .
by the way , i don't call myself ignacio anymore .
i'm ngel .
why's that?
it's my stage name .
an actor can't be called ignacio rodrguez .
he can't?
of course not .
ngel andrade .
everyone calls me that , even my mother .
that's great .
thank you .
ignacio was ..
ngel .
ignacio ...
ngel .
well , ignacio , before he became ngel , was ... is an old school friend .
martn is my production director . and maid of all work .
well , ignacio ...
ngel ...

no , don't worry .
well , ngel , it was great seeing you .

no , thanks a lot .
so long .
my pleasure .
you look great !
so do you .
do read " the visit
yes , i will .
i'm dying of curiosity .
great .
see you .
i thought he'd never leave !
is he really a friend of yours?
yes .
i haven't seen him since school .
we were really close .
well , he was my first love .
but he's changed a lot .
i didn't recognize him .
will you see him again?
no .
it seemed that you liked him .
no , there's nothing less erotic than an actor looking for work .
the visit " .
ever since we started touring with the show " the bomb " i've been waiting for this moment .
today we're playing in the town where i went to school .
i won't mention its name so as not to promote it .
i owe my best memories to the olympo cinema , which is now in ruins .
card .
i'm fucking sick of losing !
then clear off .
take a break .
thank you .
she defines herself as a mix of desert , hazard , and cafeteria .
she's a great artiste and a great friend of mine .
with all of you , our next act , the mystery and the fascination of the one and only , the inimitable ,
zahara !
a bit of applause for crissake !
so ...
what?
listen ...
i'll see you at the hostel .
yeah , but ...
paquito , you heard me .
you've got time for everything , fag .
monda !
wait for me , love !
hello .
hello .
what's wrong?
i can't find my keys .
may i help you?
sure .
no , they're not here .
let's see .
not here either .
no?
no .
here they are !
my lips are wearing out !
i drank too much .
you're telling me .
hey !
i'm sucking your dick !
he's out cold !
a kid .
not a cent .
a lottery ticket .
i'll keep that .
don't start the engine right outside .
but he's passed out !
well hung , isn't he?
he's not bad .
and look , he's still hard !
love ,
let me suck him off a bit .
no , you've got things to do .
you've been at him for hours .
look at your lip !
come on , the bike won't run away .
shut up !
now , go hide the bike .
hurry back , i'll see you in your room before 7 : 00 .
sure , i get all the dirty work and you have all the fun .
now you get a hard on , asshole !
it's not fair !
enrique serrano !
enrique !
paquito !
come up here !
what about the bike?
leave it there .
come up .
there's nothing like loading up on drugs and hormones to end up as crazy as you , bitch .
the keys !
we're not stealing the bike !
why not?
we've got a buyer .
i'll explain later .
i'll meet you at the mass .
so we're going to the school? yes , now more than ever .
i'm flipping out , bitch !
i bet you are .
dear enrique , it's me , ignacio .
i've dreamed so much of this moment !
years have gone by but i've never forgotten you .
we have to meet again , but when you're not drunk .
i want to tell you about my life and hear about yours while we eat a cream cake in the mallol patisserie , like when we got out of school on weekends .
i'm not going to complicate your life .
i know you're married and have a child .
i know that you live in the next town , that you're broke and that i'd like to help you .
right now , i'm working on something , but i'll explain it all in the patisserie .
i'll wait for you from 6 : 00 to 7 : 00 .
do come !
i adore you .
ignacio .
yes?
i miss you .
have you unpacked all the boxes?
not even half of them .
do you need a hand?
i don't mind , really .
it's best if you don't , martn .
thanks .
can i call you later?
i'm reading .
oh , do forgive me .
don't be so fucking touchy !
i'll call you in a while .
do that , even if it's late .
we saw sara's first films here .
and " breakfast at tiffany's " .
enrique and i groped each other for the first time here .
my knees are trembling just thinking about it .
i'm meeting him at 6 : 00 in the patisserie .
don't get your hopes up .
remember , he's married .
if father manolo hadn't separated us ...
what's he got to do with it?
a lot , everything !
that priest owes me a lot and it's time for him to pay .
i hate seeing you like this .
you got anything left?
yes .
what?
cocaine .
c'mon , let's have some !
here?
of course .
no one's out in the streets yet .
oh , fag !
come on .
a nailful for my gal paca .
one more .
i believe in couples . two fucks , two bumps , two " amigas
two rode together " , " two for the road " .
you're such a pig !
right , let's go to school !
gee up , girl !
come on , best foot forward .
this was my school .
i'm worn out .
do you have anything left?
be quiet .
it has started .
the god of hope who , by the grace of the holy spirit , fills us with his joy and peace ...
that's father manolo .
he looks so old !
well he's no chicken .
i guess .
zahara , this is crazy !
are you backing out , bitch?
no , but the chapel is so tiny , there's no place to hide .
when he sees us appear , he'll do what christ did to the buyers in the temple .
he drove them out with a whip , and he was christ !
so this man who , according to you , is so imperfect ...
i confess to god , the father almighty , and to you , my brethren , that i have sinned through thought , word , deed and omission .
through my fault .
through your fault .
through my fault .
through your fault .
through my most grievous fault .
so i beseech the blessed mary , ever virgin , the angels , the saints , and you , my brethren , to intercede for me before our lord god .
almighty god , have mercy on us , forgive us our sins and lead us to eternal life .
through jesus christ our lord .
we'll see ...
the lord be with you .
i could use him .
may the blessing of almighty god ,
father , son and holy spirit descend upon you .
you may go in peace .
i hope so .
go back to the dormitory and sleep a bit more .
thank you , father .
if i'm in the sacristy for too long , don't wait .
we'll meet at the hostel for lunch , sweetheart .
cute !
divine !
good morning , father manolo .
what do you want?
you can't come in here !
i'm the sister of an ex pupil , ignacio rodrguez .
you still can't come in here !
don't you remember ignacio?
we've had a lot of pupils .
but no one like ignacio , i'm sure .
i've brought an important message from him .
he can give it to me himself .
he can't .
he died in an accident .
i'm sorry .
now , please go .
go away !
hide !
i've got it all !
hide , he's coming !
ignacio ...
i told you to leave !
what are you doing here?
the same as you , remembering ignacio .
get out !
we have to talk , father .
it'll only take a minute .
say what you have to say and go !
are we going to talk in the dark?
i don't mind .
i'm used to working in the dark .
what do you want?
a better life and a better body .
what do i have to do with those improvements?
you can help me finance them .
i don't believe ignacio is dead or that you're his sister .
i don't even believe you're a woman .
are you locking me in?
i don't want anyone coming in by mistake .
and now , tell me why you're here !
ok .
i'll get to the point .
it's a story by ignacio .
yes , he took your advice and kept on writing .
i've got a friend , a pig , who works at " diario 16 " .
he's very interested in publishing this story .
but first i'd like your opinion .
apart from being ignacio's literature teacher you're one of the main characters in this story .
read this .
each month , the boys who got on the honors board , that is , the ones who got the best grades , were rewarded with a day in the country .
we were always accompanied by our literature teacher , father manolo .
moon river ,
always on my mind .
i won't be swept away
by the water ,
the muddy water of that moon river as it flows along .
river and moon ,
tell me where to find my god , and good and ill .
tell me .
i'm longing to know
what is hidden
in the dark
and you'll find it ...
no !
ignacio !
ignacio !
a trickle of blood divided my forehead in two .
i had a feeling the same thing would happen with my life .
it would always be divided and i couldn't help it .
open the door , father .
it is i.
what is it?
there's been a robbery .
where?
in the chapel .
i think it was after your mass .
were you missing anything?
no .
the chalice , the paten , the jug , the cruets ...
they must be found !
the boys mustn't hear about this .
very well .
and no one is to bother me , except you .
was that father jos?
ignacio hated him .
does he still hit the pupils?
he never lad a hand on ignacio .
that was the principal's privilege .
to sum up , i want a million in cash .
or else " diario 16 " will publish the whole story .
i don't have a million pesetas , much less in cash .
but you can get it .
now , if you don't mind , i'm leaving .
i've said all i had to say .
but keep reading , it gets better .
the key .
wait .
wait until after break time .
it'll just be a minute .
so you came to blackmail me .
tell ignacio he's overrating these pages .
they're garbage !
garbage is hot !
you and i make a best selling couple .
and the editor of " diario 16 " knows that .
you're in no position to threaten anyone .
people will believe me , not you .
no , people have changed .
this is 1977 .
this society puts my freedom above your hypocrisy .
if we treated ignacio so badly , why did he come back?
why didn't he report us or change schools?
he came back 'cause he'd fallen in love , with a classmate .
enrique serrano .
remember him?
yes .
do you mind if i keep reading?
there were lots of celebrations at school .
the most important one was principal's day .
that day , there were sports competitions and religious acts , and we had a special meal .
come with me , ignacio .
come along !
i haven't finished .
you'll sing better that way .
do you know the new words?
yes , i've got the crib father manolo gave me .
call him reverend principal .
he's the school principal from today .
i know .
don't answer back .
when you're singing , keep looking at him , as if there were no one else in the dining room .
do you understand?
yes .
father jos , placed me in the center of the dining room .
i felt odd in front of all those priests drinking and eating , and i was a bit scared , but they all looked at me kindly , except father manolo , who looked ready to cry .
and now , father jos manuel , as a birthday gift , ignacio is going to sing one of your favorite songs .
torna a sorrento " .
the new words , " gardener " , were written by father jos manuel , helped by my humble self .
when you're ready , ignacio .
gardener , gardener , night and day among your flowers ,
setting fire to their colors with the flame of your love .
and you place in every calyx the smile of your yearning ,
with your eyes turned up to heaven
where all your hopes reside .
and your flowers , gardener , with their corollas burning brightly join together in gratitude
and embalm you with their scent .
continue with your labor ,
cultivating all the flowers
entrusted to your love by the lord .
i thought you didn't like me .
no , just the opposite !
but every time i looked at you , you looked away .
because you made me nervous .
and now i don't?
no .
come in .
may i help you?
don't you recognize me , mother?
has the world changed me so much?
mother soledad !
what are you doing here?
i've come to stay .
to stay?
sara is so beautiful !
in this house?
no .
never it's been a long time .
who can remember if i did something i shouldn't have?
it's impossible .
it is not god who rejects you .
it is i , in the name of my order .
what's wrong?
i can't sleep .
neither can i.
what we did in the cinema wasn't right .
i liked it .
so did i.
but i think it was a sin , and god's going to punish us .
god?
i don't believe in god .
what do you believe in?
i'm a hedonist .
what's that?
people who like having fun .
i read it in an encyclopedia .
what's the matter?
you hear that?
father manolo !
open the door !
or must i break it down and let the whole school know what you're doing?
ignacio !
i know you're in there !
i've seen your feet .
i can hear you breathing .
ignacio !
we're not doing anything !
get out !
i'll deal with you later !
i'm not leaving ignacio alone with you .
how dare you !
get out of here immediately !
enrique , please .
do as he says .
come here .
what were you doing in there?
nothing .
nothing?
i swear , father .
then why was the door locked?
come along .
come with me to the chapel .
the bell !
what are you thinking of?
i think i've just lost my faith at this moment , so i no longer believe in god or hell .
as i don't believe in hell i'm not afraid , and without fear i'm capable of anything .
we'll forget this , ignacio .
even if i wanted to , i can't stay angry with you .
but promise that what happened tonight won't happen again .
and enrique?
what about him?
will he be punished?
i should expel him !
i'm sure he was responsible for it all .
no , i was .
don't cry .
he's a very bad influence on you .
i want what's best for you .
if you don't expel him i'll do what you want .
hush .
i sold myself for the first time in that sacristy to avoid enrique being expelled .
but father manolo tricked me .
i swore that one day i'd make him pay for that .
on your feet !
hands behind your head !
and , one !
change !
change !
change !
change !
change !
change !
hurry up , enrique !
we'll miss the bus !
change !
change !
i'm happy you came !
you're better without the beard .
thank you .
what are you doing?
i'm re reading your story .
didn't you like it the first time?
of course .
just look at it .
i couldn't help making notes .
force of habit .
that's ok , it's your copy .
thanks .
right , well ...
how can i put this?
i think there's a good film in this story and i'd like to direct it .
really?
you're not kidding me?
i never joke about work .
but first , tell me how much you want for the rights?
what rights?
the story is yours !
do what you fucking want with it !
so you really liked it?
i admit that when you said it was based on our childhood
i felt a bit apprehensive .
but i was very touched .
i'm so happy , man .
remember i'm an actor and i want out of bumblebee .
yes , i know that .
you'd be perfect as enrique serrano , naked on the bed , with zahara's letter on the pillow .
enrique serrano?
i think i'd rather play zahara .
zahara , you?
you're crazy !
why?
well ...
you're too well built .
you're not right .
martn , we've got our story !
i can slim down !
i can get into the part !
i'm used to that in the theater .
like robert de niro ...
make a photocopy .
the visit "?
yes .
ignacio and i are starting on the script .
if you're going to direct it , it's best if you write it yourself .
all right , ignacio .
ngel !
start calling me ngel , or you'll never get used to it .
ngel .
do you mind driving?
i'm a bit shaky .
i'm surprised you can even walk , with all you've taken .
we had to celebrate , right?
i thought we'd be talking about the project .
we'll talk later .
we've got time .
remember?
remember what?
nothing .
you're really high .
what should i remember?
nothing .
turn off here .
is all this yours?
no , no way .
i've just rented it .
don't be too impressed , it's a mess inside .
how about a swim?
it would do you good .
how's the water?
it's waiting for you .
will you pass me a cigarette?
you weren't serious about playing zahara , were you?
totally .
i don't joke about work either .
then let's not talk about work .
what are you doing?
sleeping here or going back to madrid?
if you want , i'll stay .
but talking about bodies , if i look too manly i can slim down .
i'm very flexible , i can do anything .
you disconcert me , ngel .
you told me that already .
and you told me about slimming down .
why don't we just talk clearly?
i can't say it any more clearly1
i'm an actor .
i spent three fucking years doing shit with bumblebee .
this is my first chance to get a terrific part and i won't let it slip away .
you can't do zahara .
not at first sight , but give me time !
you're a good director , and i'll do anything !
you just have to trust both of us .
i've tried .
but i can't trust you .
why?
i just can't recognize the ignacio i knew at school .
the one who loved " cuore matto " and so many other things .
my tastes have changed .
is that what bothers you?
no .
people change with time .
not you .
simply , you're not ignacio .
who the fuck are you to decide who i am or who i'm not?
how dare you?
why am i not ignacio?
because i don't remember a song from years ago?
apart from that .
because i'm not sucking your dick?
if i'd stayed like the kid you knew , i'd be dead now .
i already am .
dead tired .
i'm going to bed .
what are you doing?
i don't know .
you tell me .
tell you what?
if i'm going to play zahara .
does your staying depend on that?
no !
but if i don't play zahara there's no film .
then i don't know why you're here , cockteaser .
get out !
why the hell did i decide to see you again , fucking faggot !
a woman threw herself into a pool of hungry crocodiles in a zoo that was crowded with visitors at the time .
when the first crocodile attacked , the woman hugged it , according to the witness .
the crocodiles devoured the body of the woman , who never complained , in a few minutes .
what a horrible death !
well ...
she didn't even open her mouth .
what's on your mind?
hungry crocodiles .
hello .
hello , come in .
it's the journalist .
why are you here?
ton interview me?
no .
well , yes .
which is it , cutie?
i'm not a journalist , i'm an actor .
and i'd like you to help me prepare a character .
what character?
a tranny who imitates sara montiel , among others .
that's me !
why don't they give me the part?
well , you're not an actor , you're just a faggot .
what you have to learn is how to be polite , because that's no way to treat a lady !
i'm sorry .
so will you teach me?
and how will you pay me , honey?
that's what i'm looking for !
two minutes .
we'll talk later .
i'm on now .
everything you do is great for me .
i'm delighted .
see you later .
ortigueira , 6 kilometers .
hello .
what can i get you?
a beer .
forgive me for asking , but how did you get that lighter?
you're not from here .
i stole it from a friend .
his family lives here .
maybe you know him .
his name is ngel andrade .
yes .
that's his stage name .
sure , i know him .
you do?
yes , very well .
that's great .
who is it?
enrique .
i was at school with ignacio .
go away or i'll call the police !
excuse me .
are you enrique goded?
yes .
i'm ignacio's mother .
i'm delighted to meet you .
come in .
thank you .
forgive my sister in law .
i've got the heart problem , but she's the one who gets scared .
it doesn't matter .
ignacio talked a lot about you .
we were very good friends .
i know .
the last time he came to see me he wrote you a letter .
a letter?
i never got it .
it was three years ago .
he didn't know your address , he sent it to the ministry of culture .
then i'm not surprised .
by the time it was returned , he was dead .
let's go into the dining room .
that's my son juan .
then younger boy .
he's in the theater .
he's changed his name .
he says there are too many juans .
he wants even me to call him ngel .
i'd like to see ignacio's room .
to be honest , he didn't really have a room .
but when he came he liked to use the attic .
would you like to see it?
we're going upstairs !
juan burned everything .
the notebooks , the clothes ...
all except those magazines .
there's nothing left of what ignacio wrote?
no .
what a pity !
are you from a publisher too?
no .
what publisher?
soon after ignacio died , a man came who was in charge of publishing young authors ,
or so he said .
he was desperate to get his hands on ignacio's stories .
do you remember his name , or the publisher's?
no , but he was very insistent .
so i told the truth , that juan had burned everything , and he even asked for juan's address .
i gave him a false one , of course .
i think that man was half mad .
this is ignacio's letter .
it didn't get burned because i never told juan it had been returned .
thank you , ma'am .
don't judge my juan .
he's a good son , but his brother's death really hit him .
he was the one who found him .
dear enrique .
at last i've got news of you .
i read it in the papers .
you've directed your first film , man .
even if it was underground .
and to think i was the film buff !
you'll be pleased to hear i'm still writing .
i'm enclosing a story that would make a divine film .
father manolo inspired it .
it's incredible , but i ran into him the other day in valencia .
i'm visiting my mother now , but i live in valencia .
i've checked up , he isn't a priest anymore .
he calls himself by his last name , berenguer .
he works in a publisher's , he's married and has a son .
he's crying out to be blackmailed !
so i wrote " the visit " , the story i'm sending you .
read it , please .
at this point in my life , i need a lot of money and i'm going to get it from that fucker !
he owes me a lot , and it's time for him to pay .
write to me and i'll tell you the rest of the story .
all i'm asking is to hear from you .
i can only share this story with you .
i love you .
your ignacio .
i'll get it .
what do you want?
i've come to apologize .
i'll give you your shorts .
you left them behind .
thank you .
i'm very sorry about what i said .
i take it all back .
if you're still interested , " the visit " is yours .
do it with whomever and however you want .
have you lost weight?
yes .
i'm really working on it .
i want to lose even more .
and i'm taking classes .
classes in what?
in how to be a queen .
i'm working with the best sara montiel impersonator .
she performs at " bambola " , a gay club .
i'm workin as a waiter there . so i can study the queens more closely .
then you're still thinking about zahara .
yes .
just let me do an audition .
thank you .
you had it !
yes , you left that behind too .
ignacio , i'd like to talk ...
until you call me ngel ,
i won't believe you're taking me seriously .
ngel , i'm sure you're a good actor , now more than ever .
so you'll let me audition?
the audition worked for several months , long enough for me to throw myself into the shooting of " the visit " , like the woman who threw herself to the crocodiles and hugged them as they ate her .
you've changed the ending .
yes .
the visit " can't end happily , like your story .
why not?
zahara can't just walk out of the school .
she's a threat to the priests .
and we know what the church is capable of .
but this ending is really heavy , man .
for you , as an actor , it's much more intresting .
you think so?
of course .
i shot " the visit " as a homage to ignacio .
in his letter , he'd said he'd love to see it on the screen .
and also to discover the enigma of juan .
he allowed me to penetrate him frequently , but only physically .
we were about to finish shooting and his mystery was still intact .
but on the last day we had a visit .
silence !
and ... roll camera !
rolling !
the visit " 91 , 1 , first take .
zahara , darling !
action !
the boys are in class and i'm sick of arguing .
let me out !
do you want to kidnap me?
open the door !
i have to take a piss , buy cigarettes , get a fix !
even if i got the money , how can i be sure you won't blackmail me again?
you'll never be sure .
that's my revenge .
let me out or i'll scream .
i loved ignacio .
you don't love a boy of ten .
you harass him , you abuse him !
i loved him .
please , let me out !
i'm locked in !
she's threatening to denounce us .
she wants a million pesetas to keep quiet .
if you give her a single peseta , you'll never stop paying .
i knew we'd meet again , scum !
you know her?
you knew him much better than i did .
it's ignacio rodrguez .
ignacio !
it can't be !
we have to finish him off .
he's a threat to the whole congregation !
he wants to say something .
yes , that we let him do .
if you're going to kill me ,
i'd like to confess first .
confess what?
thanks to you we've got no way out .
you have to stay calm .
i'll get rid of the body .
how?
it's best if you know nothing .
it was self defense , father .
he'd have made our lives impossible .
yes ,
i guess so .
and there are no witnesses .
god .
yes , but he's on our side .
cut !
we've cut , guys !
this one's good .
what about the other one?
give me no .
1 as well .
well done , guys .
no , it was great .
is anything wrong , ngel?
no .
i'll see you later .
it went really well .
put that down !
who are you?
the villain in your film .
father manolo !
mr. berenguer .
i'm not even a father to my own son now .
get out !
i read in a magazine that you were here .
go and drink some hot milk with honey , and take an aspirin , and leave me alone .
i've got a lot to do , i can't waste time on you .
not even to find out how ignacio died?
or who killed him?
and if it concedes with your film?
say what you have to say and go .
i was living valencia .
i worked for a publisher that promoted young writers .
three years ago , i received a story called " the visit " , signed by ignacio rodrguez .
ignacio rodrguez calling about the new writers anthology .
didn't you tell him he was rejected?
yes , but he insists on speaking to you .
he's on your line .
mr. jos manuel berenguer?
yes .
i preferred father manolo .
excuse me?
are you the author of " the visit "?
yes .
we decided not to include it in " short stories of the 80s
i'm sorry .
you and i have to talk .
i think not .
i've got nothing more to say .
but i do .
i went to st. john's school .
you were my literature teacher , and you were madly in love with me .
i remember how you'd embrace me from behind while you declared your love .
i can't believe you've forgotten .
i remember the buttons on your sauterne digging into my backbone .
have you really forgotten?
i'll expect you at my house at 7 : 00 .
my address is on the back of the envelope , father manolo .
push the door .
it's just stuck .
that wasn't the ignacio you and i loved .
hello , mr. berenguer .
i'm ignacio .
please , come in .
yes , i'm a junkie , but i want to quit and i thought you could help me .
well , i know a clinic .
so do i , but first i want to fix myself up a bit .
i know i've got divine tits , but everything else ...
anyway , i won't get into that .
looking pretty costs a lot of money , father manolo .
i think a million would do it .
a million?
yes , in cash , and my lips are sealed .
i won't say a word .
you're out of your mind !
sexual harassment is frowned upon , father manolo .
what would your wife think , or your boss?
you're in no position to blackmail anyone .
i could have you arrested tonight .
very well .
you call the police , i'll call your wife and the media .
a blackmailer can't be as defenseless as you are .
believe me , i know what i'm saying .
juan , go back to your room .
i want to watch tv .
watch it later , we're talking business .
i don't mind if he stays .
i'm sure you don't .
he's my brother , he's looking after me .
or that's my mother's idea .
i'm mr. berenguer .
one million , end of story .
do you want me to call him juan , or ngel?
the blackmail became an investment for me .
i visited the brothers frequently so i could keep seeing juan .
remember don narciso , the nazi?
he love my illustrations .
look at this one .
and there's another one ...
look , this is beautiful .
and this one ...
children of spain
i brought you this .
i kept ignacio happy with small amounts of money .
and i kept stalling him .
i desired juan , more and more every day .
hello .
you brought the dough?
i can only give you 50, 000 .
you said you'd bring the million !
i said they'd tell me today if i'd get the loan .
they said yes , but they have to check my guarantees .
i need another three weeks .
another three weeks !
i'm a junkie .
haven't you noticed?
i could be dead in three weeks .
are you going away?
obviously !
i want to see my mother before i check in .
she has to see me with these teeth and this face , and it's your fault !
don't be unfair , ignacio , i'm doing what i can .
then do more !
i'll be gone for a week .
when i come back i want that million .
if you don't have it , you'll be sorry .
i'm sick of being put off !
i'll try to hurry them up , but ...
father .
come along .
shall i help you?
sure , take the olivetti , it's the heaviest .
while you're at it , take this one too .
stop that taxi .
taxi .
bye , father .
goodbye .
open the trunk , please .
my scarf !
excuse me .
i've come for my scarf .
i must have left it here .
fuck , it's really soft !
silk .
it's yours .
to be honest , i left it here for you .
cut it out , i'm not ignacio !
fortunately .
what time is it?
12 : 30 .
did he give you anything for me?
ignacio?
no .
fuck !
i had to pay my school fees today .
are you studying?
yes .
drama .
i'm an actor .
selfish bastard !
he knew i had to pay today and he didn't give me anything .
obviously , i paid his fees .
i hadn't told ignacio but the bank had granted me a loan of two million .
i withdrew the first million .
i told my wife i was going to a conference abroad .
she didn't believe me .
i guess that doesn't interest you .
not in the least .
how did ignacio die?
the week juan and i spent alone was the happiest in my life .
every day i bought him something .
clothes , a walkman , a super 8 camera .
i enjoyed the gifts more than he did .
take off your shirt .
take it off !
now it's my turn !
now , take that off .
show me your cock .
if you're going to shoot my dick , don't show my face !
too late .
i can't ... !
you !
give me some dough !
i've got the fucking sweats .
how's mom?
she had another heart attack .
but she's all right now .
i'm the one who's sick .
the dough !
more !
that's all i have .
i want that million now !
no more excuses !
no more stalling and no more gifts .
mom !
how are you , juan?
has ignacio arrived?
yes ! what happened this time?
the usual thing , son , but ...
he stole my pension , and i'd just gotten it !
is that true?
yes , love , it is .
tell auntie i'll send her some money .
he promised me he was going into a clinic .
and you believed him?
yes , this time he really means it .
he's going to try .
you have to help him .
how?
by being with him .
don't leave him .
promise me .
i promise .
listen , did he give you the cheese and the chorizos?
delicous !
why did you bother?
there's food in valencia .
don't spend your money .
they're your favorites .
i'd kept them for you .
you can't get them in valencia .
all right , thanks .
lots of love , son .
yes , call me if anything happens .
don't worry , i will .
bye .
where's ignacio?
i'm going to kill him !
it was juan's idea .
or mine , i don't know .
the only solution was to get rid of him .
more or less what you've just shot .
but not as violent .
how did you think of it?
ignacio's story doesn't end like that .
while i was adapting it , i found out that ignacio was dead .
did juan tell you?
no .
i found out myself .
will you just tell me how it happened?
i arranged to meet juan at the museum of giant figures .
he had it all planned out .
much more than it seemed at first .
i'll buy the junk and you give it to him .
why me?
fuck , he's my brother !
i'm not a monster .
do you think this doesn't hurt me?
but he's ruining all our lives .
what will we do afterwards?
we won't meet for a while .
why?
you said there'd be no investigation .
just in case .
it's best not to arouse suspicion .
i'll go and look after my mother , she'll need it .
when things calm down , i'll call you and we'll go away .
have you got the money?
yes .
no .
what will i do while i'm waiting?
work , earn money .
we'll need it .
the situation at home is unbearable .
apologize to your wife and enjoy your son .
tell her the truth .
what?
say you've been with someone else , a woman .
give me your mother's address .
it's best if i don't .
then you won't be tempted to come see me .
what are they laughing at?
they're laughing at us .
at me , at least .
juan bought deadly pure heroin .
he gave it to me and i went to ignacio's .
alone .
this is my last fix .
what do you mean?
i'm quitting .
this time i really am .
before i get my face and all the rest done ,
i'm checking into a detox clinic .
i've already applied .
good .
you'll have the money tomorrow .
i hope so .
before noon , ok?
just in case , i wrote two letters , one for the publisher and the other for your wife , telling all you've hidden from them in the past and present .
that's unnecessary .
give them to me !
when i get the money .
before noon .
pretty , aren't they?
what?
my tits .
yes , they're wonderful .
thank you .
shall i help you?
no , no .
go away .
i don't like fixing in front of you .
it's done .
pull in here .
we'll go to the cinema to kill time .
it's as if all the films were talking about us .
now what?
i'm going home .
you want me to go with you?
no , you'd better not .
remember to get those two letters .
yes .
if you don't we'll be in trouble .
i'll get everything don't worry .
if we won't be seeing each other for a while , give me some of the super 8s .
it would console me to see us screwing .
you're nuts !
what if your wife saw them?
we have to burn them .
i'll take care of that .
let's go .
get in for a minute .
no , i'm going to take a taxi .
then ,
i won't see you again?
it's just for a few days .
taxi .
call me as soon as you can .
yes .
ignacio?
enrique .
what's wrong?
you !
at last !
i read in this film magazine that you were here .
what did you tell him?
everything .
now you only have me , darling .
you're crazy .
remember i've got my brother's letters , accusing you of his death .
we both did it , my love .
the letters only mention you .
enrique , wait !
enrique .
are you all right?
leave me alone !
if i ever see you again , i swear i'll kill you !
now that i've found you , i won't let you go .
get used to the idea .
mnica .
can you give me a lift?
sure .
yes?
get in the front .
hello .
who was that?
someone looking for enrique .
who is it?
it's me .
give me back the keys .
your things are in the hall .
take them away .
the taxi's gone .
you'll have to lend me the car or drive me back to madrid .
i want to order a taxi .
11 , avenida del aqua .
enrique goded , yes .
thank you .
i was going to tell you after the shoot .
tell me what?
that my name is juan .
that i'm ignacio's brother and ignacio died four years ago .
i knew that already .
i know that you knew .
what do you mean?
my mother rang to tell me you'd been to the house .
i guessed you'd learned everything .
when you asked for the audition , you knew that i knew?
yes .
and you still kept pretending?
what else could i do?
i didn't lie you knew everything .
no , i didn't , far from it .
i knew you'd taken ignacio's place and that he was dead , but i never imagined that you'd killed him !
that's the taxi .
i didn't kill him , berenguer did !
ignacio was blackmailing him .
and you were hustling him !
the taxi's waiting .
you don't know what it is like to have a brother like that and live in a small town .
juan , the taxi is waiting .
why did you choose me?
you still don't see me as zahara .
was it just to fuck me?
it was curiosity .
i wanted to see how far you would go and how much i could take .
i would go a lot further .
i bet you would .
you needn't explain any more .
it's not mine .
it's from ignacio .
i think i've succeeded ...
