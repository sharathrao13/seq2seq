and ruin our lives .
don't you think?
let show that human what happen when he messed with sabers .
alert the troops .
we attack at dawn .
and diego , bring me that baby .

lf i'm gonna enjoy my revenge , i want it to be fresh .
i'm wiped out .
that's your shelter?
you're a big guy .
you got a lot of woods .
i'm a little guy .
you only got a stick .

i'll start the fire .

hey , i think i saw its flare .
any chance i can squeeze in there with you?
lsn't there someone else you can annoy?
friends?
family?
poison reptiles?
my family is bad .
they just kind of migrate without me .
you should see what they did last year .
they woke up early and they tied my hands and feet together .
they buried the cave door , and covered their tracks .
they made it anyway .
so what about you?
you got family?
okay , you're tired , i see .
we'll talk tomorrow morning .
manfred?
manfred .

where's the baby?
i lost it over the falls .
you lost it?
i want that baby , diego .
i'll get it .
you better .
unless you want to serve yourself as the replacement .
we'll go up to half peak .
meet us there .
it'd better be alive .
can we trust you with that , diego?
let's go !
and you pick this year off my shoulders .
lf you gonna have a mating partner , at least pick a female with the same color palette , right?
and i thought , wow , he's gonna go primal , you know what i'm saying?
lf you find a mate in life , you should be loyal .
ln your case , it's grateful .
get away from me .
well , i think mate in life is stupid .
i mean everybody just sit around . . .
mandy?
look at that .
he's okay .
she's gone .
hey , mandy , are you forgetting something?
no .
but you just saved him .
yeah , but i'm still trying to get rid of the last thing i saved .
you can't leave him here .
look , there's smoke .
that's his heir right up the hill .
we should return him .
let's get something straight .
there's no " we " .
there never was a " we " .
ln fact , without me , there wouldn't even be a " you " !
just up the hill .
listen very carefully .
i'm not g o i n g .
fine .
be a jerk .
i'll take care of him .
go .
yeah , that's good .
you take care of him?
you can't even take care of yourself .
this i gotta see .
i'll return him .
we don't need that mandy .
you know we do .
you're embarrassing the nature , do you know that?
i'm fine .
i'm fine !
i'm gonna die .
that thing is mine .
no , actually that thing belongs to us .
us?
you two are barely a couple .
there is no " us " .
i see .
you can have one of your own so you won't adopt .
look , i'm sorry to interrupt this .
but we gotta go .
the baby , please .
i'm returning to his heir .
oh , yeah .
nice try , bucktooth .
you're calling me a lair?
i didn't say that .
you were thinking it .
i don't like this cat .
he reads mind .
name is diego , friend .
manfred .
and i'm not your friend .
fine , manfred .
lf you're looking for its heir , you're wasting your time .
he left this morning .
thanks for the advice .
i beat this .
all right , i'll help you bring it to its heir .
but promise me you'd leave me alone after that .
okay , deal .
what's your problem?
you're my problem .
but i think you're stressed .
that's why you eat so much .
it's hard to get fat on a diet .
i'm not fat .
it's all this fur .
it makes me look puffy .
all right , yeah .
fat hair .
but when you're ready to talk , i'm here .
just drop it on the land .
shouldn't we make sure they found him?
good idea .
no , no , no !
wait .
don't spear me !
this is a problem .
now what?
that's perfect .
i told you they were gone .
look who it is .
don't you have some flaw defenseless animals to disembogue?
they couldn't be far .
they went this way?
or this way?
you don't know much about tracking , do you?
i must lost .
i see trees , either leaves , that's my tracking .
you didn't miss them by much .
it's still green .
they head north 2 hours ago .
ls it?
they head north 2 hours ago .
you don't need this aggravation .
give me the baby .
i can track human down faster than you can .
and you're just a good citizen helping out , right?
i just know where the human will go .
find the pass .
everybody knows they have a settlement on the other side .
unless you know how to track , you never gonna reach them before their pass closed up with snow .
which should be like , tomorrow .
so you can give that baby to me or go get lost in the blizzard .
it's your choice .
here's your little bundle of joy .
we'll return it to the human .
big bad tiddy widdy get cliff .
poor tiddy widdy . . .
sid , tiddy widdy is gonna lead the way .
mandy , can i talk to you for a second?
no .
the sooner we find the human , the sooner i get rid of mr. stinky drew face .
and the baby too .
you always have that jumbo around to protect you .
and when that day comes , i suggest you watch your back .
cause i'll be tuning on it .
human tracker , up front so i can see you .
help me .
you gotta make him stop .
i can't tolerate anymore !
i think this thing didn't complain this much .
stop shouting at me .
you're holding it wrong .
watch its head !
just put it down .
lts nose is dry .
that means something is wrong with it .
maybe we should lick it .
just in case .
i'll do it .
you know , the baby stinks .
so if it poops , where does it go?
humans are disgusting .
okay , you .
check for poop .
why am i the poop checker?
because returning it is your idea .
because you're small and insignificant
and because i'll pound you if you don't .
what else?
now , sid !
i mean , my goodness .
all right , look out .
coming through .
watch out !
stop waving it around !
oh , i'm gonna slip !
