# i need a ken doll pilot with a sexy smile and a flying limousine
# to pick me up , go the extra mile and deliver me to the scene
# i need five more hours in the average day
# one to get the work done , four to play
# be a devil and angel you know what i mean?
# stand back
# out of my way
# stand back
# you're crowding my day
# no time for good manners , do what i say
# if you're not here to help then you're just in the way
# the road is littered with the faint of heart , the fools who fell from stress
# it's a fact of life that you can't catch up , better learn how to love the mess
# so i'll just kick back , ignore the noise , have my way with the pretty boys ,
# what i dream at night don't even try to guess
# stand back # stand back
# out of my way
# stand back # stand back
# you're crowding my day
# now this is my time to step up to the mike
# like rock'n'roll lightning i'm ready to strike
# stand back # stand back
# oh
# stand back # stand back
# stand back

jenny ... helen , what happened?
hello .

jumped the center divide and he slammed into them .
they didn't have time to react .
that's what the police think , anyway .
i'm sorry , ed .
i remember when they bought this house .
so what happens now with the kids?
oh , hey .
do the kids have any grandparents?
yes .
paul's parents came from miami .
they just barely made it today , so ...
so sorry .
i'm so , so sorry about your aunt and uncle .
thank you .
yeah , thank you .
reverend hallin spoke so beautifully .
thanks again , sweetie .
i'm so sorry .
so sorry for your loss , jenny .
i know , sweetheart .
i know .
it smells like mommy in here .
guys .
a lot of people are waiting to pay their respects .
i'm sure they'd appreciate it if you all came downstairs .
we are gonna get through this .
all right?
hey , do you mind going to the market for me and getting some blue party napkins?
now?
i mean , can't we use something else?
helen .
i've planned the funeral and i've ...
i've made the food and taken responsibility for three very scared children .
all i'm asking you for is four packages of blue , three ply dinner napkins with a seashell design , so that people don't remember our sister and her husband with paper toweling on their i ... on their laps .
all right .
terribly sorry .
thank you .
hi , i'm wanda from next door .
if you need anything , my phone number's on the casserole .
thank you .

" section 5 .
custody and care of the davis children .
an account and trust has been set up at maplewood savings bank , in the names of audrey , henry and sarah davis .
this bank also holds the mortgage on the davis property at 207 , oak street .
yes , larry , and that mortgage is quite large .
we do need to talk about that , also .
we will .
with regard to custody of audrey , henry and sarah , we hereby appoint sole guardianship of all three children , imbuing her with all legal rights and responsibilities that guardianship entails , to helen harris .
what?
what?
it's not a mistake .
i prepared this for them myself .
they were very clear .
helen harris .
jenny should have them .
i ...
she's got kids .
i ...
she's got the mom haircut .
she's supermom .
she left a letter for each of you explaining her decision .
you know i handled your mother's will .
lindsay and paul's was equally specific .
good lord , lindsay .
can i read yours?
helen .
are there any contingencies?
yes .
if helen is either unable or unwilling to care for the children ,
then you , jenny , are thusly appointed .
ok , finally , some reason .
thank you .
god , why didn't you start with that?
can you imagine helen raising three kids?
when should i tell them?
as soon as possible .
are you sure?
yep .
but we all thought ...
nope .
it's gonna be hard to take care of us if you're dead too .
this?
won't kill me for years .
who's gonna take me to school?
i guess i am .
and make me chicken fingers?
me .
and give me a bath?
me .
and check my nose boogies for infections?
we'll find someone else to do that last thing .
come here .
all we gotta do is stick together .
everything's gonna be ok .
thanks for trying , aunt helen , but it's not gonna be ok .
come on , sarah .
it's time for your bath .
come on , henry .
good idea .
great .
uh ...
you guys do that , while aunt helen is gonna go out and check the lawn .
is aunt helen older than you , audrey?
get farther down .
is she playing hide and go seek?
i don't think so .
we are in deep shit .
i love new york pizza .
aunt helen , can we go to the statue of liberty tomorrow?
no , because we won't be here ...
where's henry?
he said he'd be right back .
i go to the bathroom for five seconds , and he's gone?
with mustard .
here it is .
i didn't want mustard .
you don't want mustard?
no .
all right .
no mustard .
there he is .
henry !
ok?
who's gonna pay for this?
aunt helen .
you can't do that .
you can't just leave .
i hate pizza .
i wanted a hot dog .
can you pay aaron , please?
i'm aaron .
hi , aaron .
i like that he's making new friends .
it's lovely .
talk me up !
the next time you want something like a hot dog , you tell me , ok?
and we'll all go together .
ok .
where are we going to dinner?
this is dinner .
gee , mommy never let pizza be our whole dinner .
and dad always said not to eat and walk at the same time .
well , they're not here to yell at us , so it doesn't matter .
how many beds do you have in your apartment , aunt helen?
aunt helen !
audrey , your knee .
stop !
hey , guys .
shh !
i'm telling you , if we don't go to sleep right now ,
sleepless sally gets really upset when the kids aren't going to sleep .
where's sarah?
sarah?
i'm right down here .
henry's feet stink .
phew !
but i'm a man .
give aunt helen a whiff .
i don't want to smell your feet .
ew !
i can smell them from here .
ew !
ew !
henry !
you need to wash your feet not once a week .
good night , all .
audrey , get out of the bathroom .
fire !
fire !
aunt helen?
hm?
why are we going back?
this was great .
we should spend more time here .
more time?
yeah .
we can move here .
we can't sleep every night in a stinky feet bed .
we'll move to another apartment .
it's a huge city .
you'll be closer to your job and everything .
you love your job .
what about henry and sarah?
what about them?
they've got school .
they have friends .
you guys grew up in that neighborhood .
that's why .
it's a sad neighborhood now .
everywhere we go there , we think of mom and dad .
the kids treat me differently .
we will discuss this later .
please think about it , aunt helen .
ok , we got a train to catch .
let's go .
henry , stop brushing your teeth .
they're gonna fall out .
i can't get hippo in the bag .
oh , give it to me .
ok .
there .
he's in the bag .
are you happy now?
henry !
now , the only thing to do would be to tell aunt jenny .
thinking about it , audrey .
i will think about it .
tell her we voted .
i'll think about it , audrey .
i understand the children's feelings ,
but that's not part of the plan .
that's your plan , jenny .
all right , well , what about the idea of not selling lindsay's house?
i know you guys offered to pay the mortgage , but it's enormous .
i spoke to the bank , and the mortgage is too much for us .
all right .
besides being my idea , what's wrong with moving down the block?
i mean , i think the calm of the familiar is better than the overwhelming hustle bustle of the city .
guys , can you please keep the coloring on the eggs and not each other?
oh , no , no , no .
no .
jenny , sarah thinks that hippo's parents are on vacation .
that they're coming back .
henry walks around like a zombie and draws skeletons .
audrey is my only ally .
you really have to watch her .
look , they're not happy .
and they've told me themselves .
they're not gonna be happy anywhere right now .
ok , ok .
wait .
wait .
let us talk for a minute .
wait till you see what the easter bunny brings .
he's gonna bring lots more eggs .
the easter bunny's not coming .
the easter bunny joined 50 cent .
why are you being a brat?
you're a brat .
helen is right .
a change might do them some good .
and if it doesn't work out , they can always move back here to jersey .
ew , you got some in my hair .
you know what?
you know what?
oh !
oh , no .
you're not very good at this , aunt helen .
stop it !
irwin's after ya !
turtles carry ... carry diseases .
stop it .
sarah , please .
we have to find an apartment .
we need to help aunt helen .
ok?
by being quiet .
stop it .
stop .
no .
chelsea .
no .
you know , i hear there's some pretty decent stuff in queens .
no .
we are not bridge and tunnel people .
we are manhattan people .
oh , wow .
four bedrooms .
close to central park .
the owner wants it rented quickly , so he's asking what is very reasonable for a new york apartment .
only nine thousand a month .
# i feel like an android living in a polaroid
# just another reject , it gets a little seasick
# whose life am i in?
# feels like dj vu , don't know what to do
# point my finger to the sky and finally ask the question why
# whose life am i in?
# whose life am i in?
# whose life am i in?
that's the girl looking at 4b .
one bathroom .
that's it?
yeah , well ,
i'll put you on a waiting list if a two opens up .
and look at this flower power , huh?
so i guess audrey can have the back room and henry and sarah can share the middle one and i'll just sleep on a pull out couch .
wow , graffiti .
sure , there's plenty of room for a pull out couch here .
look , you got a nice view .
so , the ad said something about a visual security system .
how does that work?
when somebody buzzes , you stick your head out the window and you look down .
that's the visual part .
then you yell for them to come up or not .
that's the security part .
here's your keys .
welcome to the astoria arms .
i am only available between 8 : 30 and nine in the morning because i have a life .
so ... home !
yeah !
i ordered the pizza .
it should be here in 30 minutes .
yay !
um ...
know what , i bet this is lead paint .
guys .
guys , guys .
don't chew on the windowsills , all right?
yeah .
stick to the table legs , like i taught you .
ok , come on , guys .
let's go , let's go .
sometime today .
into the bedroom .
this window is also painted shut .
you know , i mean , for 1200 a month , you'd think you'd have windows that open .
i want this bed .
look , for the tenth time , in the old house i had this bed and you had that bed .
but i want this bed .
that's it !
hippo goes out the window .
followed by irwin .
guys !
stop fighting .
he pinches her all the time , and hard .
it's hard .
thank you .
so , it's not that bad , right , jen?
no .
hi .
i'm nilma prasad .
i live across the hall .
here's some samosas that we made for you .
so that would make you my neighbor .
this is my neighbor , my friendly neighbor , jenny .
nilma , i'm helen .
no , i'm nilma .
i'm helen .
that's jenny .
i snagged this one in the hallway , screaming .
it's ok , flora .
mr costello's deaf .
i'm not .
so i see you have kids too , so maybe a play date sometime?
oh !
oh , my goodness , that would be wonderful .
great .
i'm jenny , helen's sister .
hello .
can i ask you a special favor?
yes .
helen is new at being a mom .
uh oh .
exactly .
these aren't her kids?
our sister passed .
oh , i'm so sorry .
bless her .
so , nilma , if you could from time to time ...
oh , absolutely .
and if they ...
which they will , no?
you could ...
no problem .
that's all i'm asking .
ok , say no more , please .
thank you so much .
ok , no problem .
just mommy talk .
oh , right .
so , helen , where have you decided to send the kids to school?
got it covered .
it's just middle school and you'll both have to be separated ,
all three of you .
no .
i vote against separation .
you know , maybe we should find a school with less policemen everywhere .
audrey .
hi .
let's go .
come on , guys .
this cab's gonna be about $100 .
that girl is fine .
hi .
yeah , she's pretty .
nice , audrey .
thanks for making my life a lot easier .
i don't like school , anyway .
i mean , i'll just drop out and get a job .
i like school .
i wanna go to school .
i want to .
aunt helen , you promised you'd find us a school .
oh , god , help me .
slow down .
stop .
that was fast .
kids .
lisa , stop dragging your sweater .

i mean , lutheranism has been in our family for as long as
lutheran people have been around .
being a lutheran is the greatest .
i mean , right , kids?
hippo wants to be a lutheran , too .
hippo is a lutheran .
i knew that god told us to move here so that we could attend your fine school .
a good , solid education taught our lutheran way is the best way .
i mean , isn't that right , father?
pastor .
father pastor .
pastor parker .
right .
thank you for that fine testimonial .
hallelujah .
hallelujah .
well .
i'm just gonna need the kids 'transcripts and blood tests and they're in .
blood tests?
make sure they're really lutheran .
you'd be surprised how many non lutherans try to sneak in .
i'm sure .
um , problem .
they're all hemophiliacs .
all three of them .
can't take blood .
shh .
they're sensitive .
it's a joke .
why would i joke about hemophilia?
there's no blood test .
that's the joke .
oh .
you don't have to be lutheran to go here .
it's queens .
there's , like , 50 lutheran kids in the whole neighborhood .
shall we take a look around?
so we have space available .
can you handle the tuition?
not a problem .
tetherball !
oh , yay !
henry , we have basketball courts , gym down there .
saint barbara's believes in basketball .
oh .
so what's the lutheran take on the afterlife?
pretty much the standard heaven , hell , purgatory thing?
pretty much .
old school around here .
you wanna go see the basketball courts?
no , i'm gonna go play tetherball .
ok .
play hard .

you don't know how .
sweetheart , are you nervous about today?
i mean , it's a big day at school .
mom was teaching her how to tie her shoelaces just before .
oh .
right .
and i guess she had a special way of tying them .
well , your mom and i were probably taught the same way .
let me think .

i hate it when that happens .
me too .
you guys wanna do my makeup?
yeah .
can i be a princess?
yeah .
you're pretty .
ok .
sarah , you don't have to learn to tie your shoes right now .
when you're ready to tie your shoes , you will .
that's right .
shoe tying's tough .
why do you think jesus wore sandals?

thanks , pastor dan .
do i look pretty?
yeah .
so , you wanna go play?
everything's gonna be fine .
a little bit of green up here .
stop !

it'll come off in a couple of days .
sorry , helen .
it's not working .
i understand .
i'm sorry , dominique .
thank you so much for everything .
i'll collect my things .
hey !
stop that racket .
are you all right , aunt helen?
you've been watching reruns all day .
reruns are the culture of the unemployed .
hey , i'll get it .
i have no life .
cable guy .
it's the exorcist .
hi .
hi .
sorry about martina .
so i brought you comfort food chunky monkey .
would you like to come in?
pastor dan .
hey , kids .
how did he get past the visual security system?
who cares?
now we can watch mtv .
yeah .
it's funny how one moment i'm living my life not really in touch with the fact that i'm sharing this planet with permanent pens , and the next moment one such pen has made , shall we say , an indelible impact on my career .
hey , helen .
a black mark on my record ,
x ed out my future ...
helen . ... and , in short , my career is dead .
like your turtle .
what?
turtle's dead .
oh , no .
oh , irwin , no .
may he rest in peace ...
shut up .
you don't understand .
this is henry's turtle .
it's his friend .
he's ...
he can't be dead .
oh , he's dead .
we need to find a body double now .
here .
what about the empty bowl?
i'll hide it .
ki ...
kids !
we're gonna go get butterscotch and chocolate syrup for the ice cream .
you stay put and watch television .
and don't come in the kitchen , i just waxed the floors .
irwin's long lost brother .
yeah .
thanks for doing this .
you're my savior .
i mean ...
i know what you mean .
so , how are things going?
fine .
hm?
fine .
just fine?
yeah .
what do you mean?
well , it's just that
i've noticed audrey spending too much time with the boys .
you know , that's normal for what she's going through , to look for that attention , but some of these kids are not exactly angels , you know what i mean?
they're 15 .
it's teenage stuff .
it's harmless .
no , it's not really harmless , cos one of these punks his name's bz
i'm about to kick his butt outta school .
let's just get upstairs before henry finds the bowl .
yeah , henry .
you said the kid likes basketball .
he never ever picks up a ball .
i know .
i've noticed that .
the thing with sarah and the shoes the other day , that's not the first time ...
hey , what do you expect , dan?
they've lost their parents , moved to a new city , changed schools , changed religions .
well , let's talk about some things you could do at home .
you wanna know what i've been doing at home?
i've been doing the best i can .
do you have any idea what this has done to my life?
hey , helen , do you have any idea what it's done to theirs?
hey , pastor dan , mr self righteous , i'm hanging on by a thread here .
i lost my sister , my social life , my disposable income , my ability to fit into a size two and this just in my job .
pretty much the only two things that haven't disappeared are my nicotine fits and the few pounds that have recently taken up residence on my ass .
so forgive me if i'm not too thrilled about being lectured , in queens , about being a lousy legal guardian to three kids who maybe shouldn't have been given to me in the first place .
they weren't given to you , they were entrusted to you by their mother , who ...
don't you talk about lindsay .
don't you dare talk about lindsay .
you didn't know her .
gimme the turtle .
that was outta line .
i'm sorry .
dan , give me the damn turtle .
helen ...
helen .
hey , helen .
dominique's is quite an impressive background .
but three children?
they're great kids .
they pretty much take care of themselves .
we love children .
we're thinking about adopting .
but there'd be a lot of traveling involved and very little notice .
i love traveling .
but would they be long trips?
but i'm not on the mommy track .
we'll be in touch .
irwin , you're not looking yourself .
ok , sarah's asleep .
go to bed now and make sure if she needs anything , you can get it for her .
i see no party .
there is no party .
that's right .
yeah .
hi .
hi .
hey , everyone , this is my aunt helen .
she don't look like no aunt i ever had .
what are you ...?
what is this?

whassup , mommy?
whassup?
you got a phat crib .
thank you .
there's my phone ringing in my phat crib .
hello .
i'm calling to remind you to come over for mother's day .
jenny , do you think that's still such a good idea?
i mean , i don't know if the kids are ...
it'll be fine .
and we're still gonna do the letter thing?
sure .
i'll show you mine , if you show me yours .
what's that noise?
audrey has company .
on a school night?
you better make them leave .
what do i say?
you say , " go home .
ok , but what if they ask why?
you say , " because i said so .
hi .
can we turn the music down?
hey , guys .
let's turn the music down a little bit .
please .
thank you .
this " crib " is closing .
and i think it's time for all y'all to go .
why?
because i said so .
i'll tell you what , we'll be gone before you know it .
bianca .
all right .
jenny , i don't know if they're quite ready to go home just yet .
helen , get nilma , now .

don't you remember what it's like to be young?
of course i remember .
it was last wednesday .
hi .
can i ask you a question?
what was lindsay thinking?
so listen , don't worry about it .
they'll appreciate it when they're older .
i know .
i just hate being hated .
i love it .
i don't have that relationship ...
you do .
you know , you can tell me all your problems , really .
i'm a solver .
i once got an axle grease stain out of silk .
ok , solver , can you find me a job close to home with decent pay?
and a dental plan for the cavity triplets?
my husband ravi .
do you know where i can find a ravi prasad?
yeah , he's inside .
you'll see , we're like one big family here .

hey , ralphy , any takers on that lime green baby?
you wise guy .
i still got five bucks says you'll sell it .
you're on .
we got ...
we got stuck with this lime green lincoln .

i can't do dishonest .
ravi , we're reshooting that commercial .
honest .
we need an honest commercial , ravi .
all right?
i'm sorry .
ms helen harris .
ok .
yes .
how long did you work as a secretary?
actually , i wasn't a secretary .
as it states right there , i was an executive assistant to dominique courier , and i had a promise of promotion to agent .
ok .
you seem like a nice girl , helen .
and you're a friend of ravi and nilma's .
all right , we're looking for a receptionist .
the pay is 17 . 50 an hour , the hours are nine to five .
so , how does that suit you , hm?
i always thought i could have a career in used cars one day .
we don't sell used cars .
previously owned or prior owned cars .
prior owned .
now , you just have to pass one little test , ok?
ravi to parts .
ravi to parts .
ravi to parts .

oh , of course i did .
mm hm .
oh .
not until you show me yours .
well , why don't we just do it after dinner?
stay !
what happened with the train?
was there a delay?
no , no .
audrey was making samosas at nilma's , so we caught the next train .
mm hm .

well , they were hungry so they ate them on the way .
can i help you with something , jenny?
you know what?
i've got everything organized .
ooh .
ooh .
sweetie , what did mommy say about kicking when she's having a conversation?
you need to wait until she's finished .
thank you very much .
did you just boss around the unborn?
it's never too early to start learning manners .
ok , kids .
we're ready .
whoa !
wow !
oh , my gosh .
look at that .
hey , guys .
holy cow .
yeah .
oliver , did you wash your hands?
yes , mom .
everything tastes great , honey .
you shouldn't have to cook on mother's day .
you know i don't mind .
being a mom is the greatest job on earth .
i know your mom felt that way .
jenny .
what?
we all love her .
we miss her .
we can mention her .
can't we?
i don't like to .
me neither .
you know , would you kids like to talk about what you've been reading?
harry potter .
harry potter .
stuff by shank 54 .
huh .
that sounds interesting .
who's that?
he writes poems .
on the side of our building .
with spray paint at four in the morning .
sometimes i help when i can't sleep because aunt helen's on a date or audrey's on the internet talking dirty or sarah's crying because we forgot to feed her again .
henry .
what?
jenny , no .
henry , what are you talking about?
is this some kind of joke?
i don't know why you keep saying things like this .
it's not funny .
i thought it was funny .
thank you .
henry was making all of that up , jenny .
jenny , what are you doing?
when a problem comes along you must whip it .
before the cream ...
jenny , give me my letter .
that's it?
that's all she left behind to explain why she chose you?
the lyrics to " whip lt "?
it makes sense to me .
what is it with you two and that song?
it's ridiculous .
i don't get it .
exactly !
what are you saying?
that that's the point?
i'm no fun?
that i don't get things?
that i never make jokes?
show me your letter .
no .
no?
no?
what do you mean " no "?
we said you would read my letter and i would read yours .
this is not a letter .
these are lyrics .
nonsensical lyrics .
this is not a letter .
if this was a letter , you could read my letter , but this is not a letter .
not a letter?
what?
you are a smug , bitter , colossal bitch .
ok .
guys .
i think this is a good time to take origami for a walk .
no , we'll miss the fight .
if you're finished , i think i'd like to serve dessert .
you don't wanna help me , you just wanna judge me .
let's all go into the living room and listen to jasmine play the piano with one arm .
you just wanna prove that you're a better mother than me , that lindsay was wrong .
why would i need to prove that?
of course i'm a better mother than you .
i've been doing it forever .
but does that matter?
no .
she still chose you over me .
exactly .
she chose , jenny .
not me .
i had no control over it .
you're angry with me because of a decision that she made for me .
# merrily , merrily , merrily , merrily life is ...
i am giving up everything for these kids , and you have no idea what that's like .
i don't know what it's like?
how do you think i got this way?
whatever this way is that's so particularly unfun and funny .
who changed your diapers?
don't start with that .
mom died when i was seven .
who fed you?
who baby sat you?
lindsay was there , too .
lindsay was in new york trying to be a dancer and i was at home not having a normal childhood cos i was too busy being your mommy .
and you're tra la la helen .
so ... free .
miss party party all night long and i never ever got to feel like that , ever .
not once .
i don't wanna fight any more .
happy mother's day .
42 foul .
flagrant .
one minute left .
maybe i can come see you dj sometime .
i don't know , miss audrey .
i'm not spinning no kids 'birthday parties , you know?
you got a fake id?
course .
nurse wilson says he's ok .
when's henry gonna play , aunt helen?
uh ...
hey , coach .
this isn't the nba finals .

why don't you put henry in?
3 , 2 , 1 .
and saint barbara's wins .
excuse me .
yes?
hi .
excuse me .
what is your problem?
aunt helen , please .
i know , i ...
he could be one of your best players .
he doesn't wanna play so you need to square that away with him .
you're the coach .
just forget about it .
i'm gonna go change .
i'm sorry that i yelled at you , dan , but i've been battling with the kids ,
i'm fighting with my sister and we're too stubborn to talk to each other .
i guess i'm just edgy .
hey , nobody ever said it was gonna be easy .
right?
yeah , try doing it on your own .
we got a lot of people around here who do .
matt higgins 'mom , she took a pay cut , she works out of her house .
and tommy meyers 'dad is with the kids all day long , then he works at night .
i mean , it's tough , but it can be done .
hey , you know what you need?
a nanny .
but i can't afford one .
you need some fun .
i'm just the man to provide it .
what are you doing on sunday?
going to church , of course .
yeah , right .
nice try .
you and the kids .
sunday afternoon .
what do you have in mind?
today we're at the central park zoo , where every spring a prayer is said , blessing the animals and the newborn babies .
pastor .
dear lord , we humbly ask that you bless these animals and all your creatures throughout the world .
blessed are you , lord .
amen .
ok , who wants a private tour of the zoo , huh?
yeah !
yeah !
all right , pastor dan .
# i do believe it
# i do believe it's true
# mm hm hm
# mm hm hm
# whoa oh
# mm hm hm
# it's a light and tumble journey
# from the east side to the park
# just a fine and fancy ramble to the zoo
# but you can take a crosstown bus if it's raining or it's cold
# and the animals will love it if you do
# if you do
# something tells me it's all happening at the zoo .
we had a really great time .
i did too .
i'm glad you guys came .
thanks again , pastor dan .
sure .
hey , hey , hey , hey .
thank you , pastor dan .
loved the sea lions .
henry , give that back to her .
don't do that .
that's not nice .
he is so bad sometimes .
they're cute , though .
listen , i'm not very good at this , so i'm just gonna ask .
you wanna go out with me sometime?
what?
you and me , on a date .
oh , no .
i made you abandon your vows?
i know you think that i'm probably worth it , and i'm not .
go back to god .
i can't be responsible for this .
hey , helen .
i'm a pastor .
i'm a lutheran minister .
i can date .
i can get married , have kids , watch dirty movies .
really?
yeah .
ok , i can't watch dirty movies , but we're pushing for it , so , you know .
what d'you say?
i'm really flattered , dan , but i ...
i can't .
i'm sorry .
i had a great day , though , today .

you don't want this one .
oh , wow .
i forgot we had this baby .
i think i know why .
it looks like a jukebox .
only a handful of these were made .
earmarked for special customers only .
like in the old days when guys like elvis presley and frank sinatra used to special order their cars right from the factory .
you're kidding .
elvis , sinatra and lincolns .
but , like i said , for special customers only .
honey , i own every hot dog stand in rockaway .

# i'm just a fool for you , baby
# and nothing's gonna change

# my sweetest pain

# uh uh uh uh
# uh uh uh uh uh
it's really not that big of a deal , dan .
hey , she was caught making out with bz .
ok , not so good .
while cutting class .
also not so good .
in a balcony in my church .
how can i come down on her for something we were caught doing a few days ago?
because you're the adult and she's the child .
she's gotta know you're serious .
kids need boundaries .
you know that .
but , aunt helen , it's a big deal that a senior asked me to the prom .
i mean , what do you want me to do?
find another senior?
yes .
audrey , i wanna treat you like an adult , but i do not want you to go to the prom with bz .
if you go with him , i'll be very disappointed .
ok .
ok .
so , will you help me find a dress?
yes , i'll find you a dress .
ok .
in the balcony of the church?
seemed like a good idea at the time .
you are so going to hell .
hey .
spider .
ok .
cradle .
all right , guys .
shoot .
whoo !
ok .
hit the showers .
henry , pick up the balls .
hey .
gimme one of those .
come on .
let's go .
take a shot .
come on .
you gotta get fired up for your game .
i am .
can't you tell?
yahoo .
oh , henry .
ok .
henry?
let's talk .
you used to love to play sports .
sit down .
you and your dad used to play basketball till it was too dark to even see the hoop .
even when i missed , he'd always count it .
he called it " giving me the benefit of the dark .
it's ok to smile about it .
no , it's not .
and it's ok to play sports .
no .
why?
because he can't play any more .
because everyone kept saying mom and dad are up in heaven and they're looking down on us always .
well , if he is , i'm not gonna make him feel bad about not playing .
like if you're having a good time without him , you're rubbing it in?
yeah .
henry .
the only thing sadder than them not being here is knowing that by not being here , you're not doing what you love .
they want you to be happy .
but then it's like i'm just forgetting them .
no , it's not .
no .
cos every time you smile , or laugh , or enjoy your life , it makes their dreams come true .
besides , if they are looking down , you really want them to be stuck watching a lousy game?
no .
my dad hates a lousy game .
come on .
yeah !
yes .
i am the senior class treasurer .
and i just ...
i want to say that i'm very honored to be taking audrey to my prom tonight .
i want you to know that .
thank you .
breathe .
hey .
take a look .
i got a wig on .
i'm gonna come out now .
how do i look?
you look just like your mother .
thank you , peter .
ok .
we're gonna go .
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
i wanna ...

ok , get closer .
smile .
all right , welcome to the senior prom bridges of friendship .

guys , your choice later .

prom king .
hey , i thought we could have our own little prom .
where's the little kids at?
they're sleeping .
doesn't the principal have to police the prom?
don't worry .
lagambina's looking out for audrey .
what is this?
# down here the river
# meets the sea
# and in the sticky heat i feel you
# open up to me
# love comes ...

she arrived with peter , but she seems to have gone off with bz .
i understand .
thank you for calling .
dan .
that was the school .
audrey left the prom with bz .
and they overheard some kids saying bz was bragging about taking her to a motel .
what motel?
they wouldn't say .
ok .
they're gonna tell me .
just come here .
i just ...
it's just that i knew it .
don't worry .

no .
thank you for your time .
jenny , we have called over 20 motels .
bz has a car , he could be anywhere .
they could be in the middle of ronkonkoma for all we know .
did you let her have a credit card?
no .
ok .
what about your credit cards?
check your wallet .
i'm having a banana .
my visa's gone .
ok .
i'm gonna call visa and check your recent activity .
if she's used it , they'll know where .

i'll explain later .
ravi , just watch the kids .

yes , ma'am .
by the way , you're not a bad person , but this is very bad behavior .
very bad behavior .

you're doing the right thing .
you are .
ok .
so good night .
good night , jenny .
you want me to make you a cup of tea?
no , thanks .
i think it would be best for me if you just go .
why?
i'm not a mom .
i'm not girlfriend material .
i'm not brave .
i'm not anything you need .
hey , helen .
no , please .
don't .
please , dan .
ok .
so , then , if you wanna come on sunday , great , and you just figure that out .

henry .
don't worry about it .

i'd be mad too .
but , really , audrey , i'm only thinking of you .
i got you guys something .
i thought you might like it .
that's darling .
ok , say goodbye to helen .
ibsen wrote , " not all women are meant to be mothers .
and i have to say , i agree with him .
fashion and family do not mix .
but , you know , there can be exceptions .
exceptions?
would you like some tea?
no , thank you .
exceptions like ...?
tinka .
tinka .
she wants you to be her agent , of all things .
and , as she is one of our biggest earners right now , well ...
i want you back .
press on this thing .
makes that big boom sound .
softer .
ok?
softer .
thanks .

smells like sunshine .
hi , i'm mickey massey .
um ...
i've been married for a long time now , but my wife and i don't have any children , so my cars became my babies .
i know .
that sounds obsessive .
but you don't know the joy i feel when i find them a good home .
i mean , look at these beauties .
what's not to love?
massey motors .
come visit us .
i love my cars .
and you will , too .
massey motors .
in queens .
now back to the saturday six o'clock movie .
phone call , mr massey .
it's your wife .
thank you .
thank you , sharon .
hello , diane .
oh , please .
i look like i always do .
good night , tim .
thank you very much .
sure i will ...
hold on a minute .
hi .
helen , you've come back to work .
oh , no .
no .
mickey , i need to borrow a car desperately .
it's an emergency .
sure .
use one of the test drives .
ok .
hey , you were great on tv .
sure , i looked great , but did i sell any cars?
i'm sorry .
eddie , i need this car .
you can't take this car .
it's mr massey's ...
i know , but it's the only one with a full tank of gas .
i have to go .
what movie star did i look like?
well ...
helen , i think you misunderstood .
ed .
ed , who do we know with a jaguar?
could be a celebrity coming to knit with you .
origami , origami .
shh .
origami .
helen .
i'm here for my kids .
ok .
i'm listening .
i don't know who i am any more without them .
i need them and i want them back .
ok , let me see if i've got that .
you need them because you want them , because you don't know who you are without them .
see , all i'm hearing is " you , you , you .
but this can't be about you .
it has to be about them .
what don't you understand?
i love those kids .
whether or not you love them was never the question .
it was whether or not you could raise them .
the power to take the kids back is yours .
this is not a power struggle between you and me .
this is me asking you to do the right thing for everyone .
the kids aren't packed .
it's too late for them to go anywhere tonight , anyway .
ed , can you let origami out?
come on .
the bases are loaded .
jeter's up .
i'll be right back .
ed .
i mean , don't you hear him?
hi .
hey , henry , audrey .
i miss you guys .
you guys heard all that?
yeah , we did .
hey , you left irwin back at our place .
why?
it's not really irwin .
my irwin had a skull and crossbones that i drew on his stomach .
why didn't you say something?
seemed you didn't want me to know .
sarah , honey , why don't you go play with turtle and figure out a name for him?
i just couldn't stand the idea of you losing something else you cared so much about .
can i put him in a bowl?
yeah .
sarah , you wanna help henry with the turtle?
can i name him hippo?
why do you want to name everything hippo?
because i can spell it .
audrey , sweetie , can you do me a favor and get me your wallet?
why?
could you just do it , please?
open it up and give me your fake id .
why?
because i said so , that's why .
i'm not gonna give it to you .
i'm not a child .
yes , you are .
you are a child , audrey , and you have a right to a childhood and you should fight for it .
but if you won't , then i will .
now , give me your id .
that was very adult of you .
you tricked me .
i thought you were on my side , but you're just like her .
i hate you .
do you hear me?
i hate you .
well ,
i'm just gonna have to live with that .
well , we don't have to decide this tonight .
jenny .
what are you doing?
at first , i didn't agree with this letter , but ...
sit down .
no , i think i'll swing .
in fact , you know what they say?
what?
it's not over till the fat lady swings .
see?
i can make a joke .
dear jenny , if you're reading this , you know that i am gone , and i asked helen to be the guardian for the kids .
and you're probably freaked about it .
yes , it's a surprising choice , considering that you are the most incredible mother i've ever known .
if you find this letter odd , understand that my always be prepared paul convinced me to write it now , while our children are young .
you must know from experience that when it comes to picking somebody else to raise your kids , no one seems right .
no one is you .
and so you choose someone who is most like you .
someone that will give the kids a taste of their real mom .
the mom they lost and never really got to know .
in so many ways , we are so much alike .
that's why i chose helen .
they're all yours .
of course , she'll have lots of fights with the kids , yet she'll find a way to make up .
welcome to the mamahood .
i know sometimes she messes things up and makes big mistakes .
on the other hand , she also makes big comebacks .
respect her , jenny .
give her a shot .
we're family , and i'm counting on you to keep everyone together .
i know helen will certainly need some help
learning how to be a mother to my kids , but i've got you for that , and who could be better?
ok .
after all , you raised helen .
you'll teach her how to be a mom .
just like you taught her how to tie her shoes .
the bunny goes around the tree and into the burrow .
pull tight .
yes !
it's about time , sarah .
