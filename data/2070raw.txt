what are you doing , harue?
you're dripping wet !
they went away ...
they've aii disappeared ...
they always do ...
i have to run away ...
run away somewhere ...
harue !
hey , harue !
listen , harue !
harue !
calm down !
harue !
thank you ...
i always wondered what it's iike to die ...
from when i was reaily iittle ...
i was always alone
any parents or family?
sure , but they're irrelevant
right ...
that after death , you iive happily with everyone over there
can we stop talking about this?
but it may be true
sure , but ...
then in high schooi it dawned on me you might be aii alone after death , too
there's no way to know
how could you?
the idea was so terrifying
i couldn't even bear it
that nothing changes with death , just right now , forever
is that what becoming a ghost is about?
you can't mess with that it's reaily bad
what have ghosts got to do with us?
besides , we're alive
then , who are they?
are they reaily alive?
how are they different from ghosts?
in fact , ghosts and people are the same , whether they're dead or alive
it's not right .
it's wrong
they're aii crazy
nobody knows what happens when you die
aii this about ghosts , but i won't believe in them , even if i see one
but i do know that i'm definitely alive and so are you , harue
that's for sure , right?
so i don't want to think about the fact we'ii die someday
just maybe ...
in 10 years , or at ieast while we're stiii alive , they'ii invent a drug that prevents death
then , we could iive forever and ever
of course you might think i'm crazy to say that , but ...
i'd rather bet on that
you want to iive forever?
yeah
that sounds iike fun?
yeah ... that's what i think
huh ... maybe i've got it aii wrong
no ...
it'ii turn out just iike you say
i'm sure
what?
ghosts won't kiii people
because that would just make more ghosts
isn't that right?
instead , they'ii try to make people immortai
by quietly ... trapping them in their own ioneliness
help ...
help ...
junco , it'ii be ok
it'ii be ok
ok ...
i feii asleep ...
how do you feel?
yeah
something to drink?
how about some coffee?
michi ...
what?
am i just going to die iike this?
of course not
that's right ...
i'ii just keep on iiving , aii alone ...
what?
no
junco !
junco !
junco !
junco !
why !
why !
junco , don't go !
junco !
mother?
mother?
mother !
i'ii be right there
harue ...
harue !
hey ...
kawashima ... take me with you
i'm scared to be alone
take me somewhere
ok , sure
where to?
somewhere far away
out of order
shit , iet's just go !
there's no one ...
no ...
where did everyone go?
i'm here
i'm here beside you
even if , there's no one else , it doesn't matter
we are both definitely here
guess that's true ...
what happened?
i've got to go back !
what?
no !
we've come this far !
but this is the end of the iine
that's not true .
it'ii start moving
i'ii go check with the driver .
come with me
ok , but promise you'ii wait right here
i'ii be right back .
promise
harue !
the forbidden room
construction materials red tape
i'm ...
not alone ...
harue , it's me , kawashima
harue !
listen !
listen , what do you say to this?
the two of us iive together
that way , we can always be together
if we keep iiving alone , we'ii just get worse and worse because we're weak
we'ii balance each other out
how about iiving that way?
would you try it with me?
what do you think , harue? !
harue !
harue !
harue !
