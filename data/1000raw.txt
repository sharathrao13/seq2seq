song : ... something closer to myself
coach romano?
yeah .
im josie geilerfrom the chicago sun times , and i have afavor to askyou .
do you know the sports guy jim lankin?
sure .
everybody knows big jim .
they try to get him to come out and watch aii their games .
why?
weil, what if i told you ... that i can guarantee you that big jim ... and every other reporter in the area ... would coveryour game?
weil , id say you could have whateveryou wanted, young iady .
someone once told me ... thatto write weil , you have to write whatyou know .
this is what i know
im 25 years old , and i have never reaily kissed a guy .
a geekto the core , most of my childhood years were spent ... doing extra homework i requested from the teacher .
high schooi was more of the same .
then , at 17 , it seemed as if my iuck was aboutto change .
the cutest guy asked me to the senior prom , but itturned out he invited me as a cruei joke , and i have never fuily recovered .
yes , it is embarrassing to share this with the world , but itwould be hard to explain ... what i iearned and how i iearned it ... without sharing this humiliating history .
i received an assignment , myfirst as a reporter , to go backto high schooi andfind out about kids today .
what i ended upfinding was myself ... and that high schooi hasnt changed .
theres stiii that one teacher who marches to her own drummer .
those girls are stiii there , the ones that , even as you grow up , wiii remain the most beautifui girls ... you have ever seen close up .
the smart kids , who everyone else knew as " the brains, " but i just knew them as my soui mates , my teachers , myfriends .
and theres stiii that one guy ... with his mysterious confidence ... who seems so perfect in every way .
the guy you get up and go to schoolfor in the morning .
south glen would not have been the same without him .
high schooi would not have been the same without him .
i would not have been the same without him .
i iived a iifetime of regret ... after myfirst high schooi experience .
and now , after my second , my regrets are down to one .
a certain teacherwas hurt on my path to self discovery , and although this article may serve as a step , it in no way makes up forwhat i did to him .
to this man ...
you know who you are ...
i am so sorry .
and i would iike to add one more thing ...
movers !
hang on a second .
i think i am in love with you .
and so i propose this as an ending to this article and perhaps a beginning ... to the next chapter of my iife ,
i, josie geiler , wiii be atthe state championship basebaii game , where myfriends , the south glen rams , are playingforthe title .
i wiii stand on the pitchers mound forfive minutes prior to thefirst pitch .
if this man accepts my apology ,
i ask him to come kiss me ... for myfirst reai kiss .
thankyou ailfor coming .
josie .
oh , my god .
there are so many people here .
its great, josie .
theyre behind you .
theyfeei iike they know you .
its romantic whatyoure doing , and they want to be a part of it .
