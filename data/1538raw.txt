shoeshine
that horse is a great horse .
yeah , he's a really great horse .
as soon as i said , " go , bersagliere , " he started off like a rocket .
i don't think there is another one like that .
not even in america .
that's nonsense .
in america ...
who knows how much they feed horses over there !
i told you not to leave the horse when you come down .
you call this a horse?
and what is it?
it's a small table .
mr. anucci , that one is always kidding around !
is the proposal still good?
50 or nothing .
but 50 bills are 50 bills .
what are they?
only paper !
easy to say !
everybody thinks since we're shoeshine boys we make money by the bundle .
come on , let's go !
is it really expensive to have a horse?
at least 300 lira a day .
goodness , bersagliere , how expensive you are !
mr. anucci , 50 is okay , but know we are a little short .
can we do it in a week?
it's okay with me .
your word?
my word .
your word?
my word .
goodbye , mr. anucci .
goodbye .
it's right .
until the horse is ours , he can rent it out to anybody he wishes .
how much do we have on hand?
i'm not sure , 32 , 35 .
why don't you know?
i told you to be accurate !
you're right , but this morning i made a lot of payments .
here .
five , 10 .
i made all stacks of five .
that's good .
15 , 20 , 25 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 500 .
plus 7 , 500 for the guy from genoa .
and the 3, 700 for the porter's lodge .
33 , 500 plus 3, 700 and 7 , 500 ... we are short 5 , 300 lira .
marcello , did the stuff arrive?
no , not yet !
it's already a week that the prick tells me ,
tomorrow , tomorrow .
and in the meantime , he gets his shoes shined .
when you bring?
tomorrow !
to you and your mother !
these pay , you know?
hey , pasquale , do you want to buy this?
no , they're just a headache .
you can't hide them or cover them up .
forget it , someone else will buy them .
let's go .
what kind of a fool are you , laughing all by yourself?
i'm thinking that one eats more than we do .
who?
the horse !
right , shoeshine joe?
how can we do it?
i've been thinking about taking him by the one at port san sebastian .
that one will starve him to death !
right , we were born yesterday !
after work , we go and have him fed in front of us .
yes , but that way he would eat only once !
i didn't think about that .
i could sleep in the stable .
and me?
right , and at your house?
no one will cry if i free up the space .
we'll see !
for the moment let's worry about making the money .
giuseppe .
what's up?
giuseppe , please ...
shoeshine joe .
on the last curve , pasquale told him , " go , bersagliere ! " and he started off like a ...
running in circles?
get lost !
i meant to say ...
get lost !
what do i do?
when will you bring me chocolate?
don't sell it , eat it !
do i look stupid?
thank you .
what's killing us is that we aren't organized .
if we were , the guards wouldn't have taken the sausages from us .
from me they took two .
what will they do with them?
they sell them .
pasquale .
hi , annarella .
where is giuseppe?
i need to talk to him .
giuseppe !
hi .
hi .
i was sent over by your mother .
she needs 300 lira .
what?
i gave her 500 this morning .
she said she needs the money .
can i?
yes , of course .
money has sure lost its value .
last year i'd give my mother 200 lire and we'd all eat .
lucky you , you don't have anybody .
once you eat , everybody has .
nonsense .
if i still had my mother and father ,
i would gladly give them a million a day !
now you're staying with us .
don't you like it?
i do .
who say s i don't?
well , let's go now !
you don't sleep in the elevator anymore?
no .
the landlord , may he drop dead , found out .
at night he calls it upstairs and i can't go in it .
now i sleep with giuseppe at quaranta alighieri .
i won't tell you the racket .
shoeshine joe !
the other day i took him to the hotel , he gave me a big chocolate cake with ice cream inside !
damn , if i'd known i would have come too .
i know , but they don't let women inside .
hey , giuseppe .
hi .
where is pasquale?
working in front of fori imperiali .
who's he?
he's attilio , my big brother .
he must be rich , huh?
yes .
he manages .
listen , could you come home with me?
i can't leave pasquale alone .
if i do , he doesn't do anything .
goodbye , then .
see you this evening .
bye .
i understood .
today at 12 : 00 at the gas tower .
make sure it's serious .
i can't waste time .
don't worry .
it's a good deal .

my pleasure .
if you need a towel and soap , you can borrow mine .
thank you .
he found the note .
him?
he's a wise guy .
he's in here for armed robbery .
with a machine gun !
there were a bunch of them , they were stealing cars too .
his father is a doctor , you know?
i don't like him .
that's because you don't know him well .
i like the others too .
i wish you could come with us .
maggi pasquale , filippucci giuseppe .
that's us .
let's go to see the warden .
the police chief wants you .
why did you fire those two masters?
they were stealing from the boys 'packages .
they were trading cigarettes .
unfortunately , nowadays , poverty is turning everybody into a criminal .
here are the two guys .
come on , come on , step forward .
so , you stated you don't know the three men that went into the home of mrs. donati anselmi ,
isn't that so?
yes .
but you know mr. anucci , don't you?
yes .
yes .
okay , good !
this man came to see me yesterday and told me he sold you a black horse .
no , he's white .
yes , right , a white one .
i misread .
a white horse , for 50 , 000 lire , correct?
yes .
yes .
and you bought him about one hour after ... the burglary in via babuino .
you know , i understand where you're going but you're wrong .
we had the money already .
is that so?
and how did you make that money?
that's our business .
listen , boys , i've come here with good intentions .
i want to help you .
yesterday i spoke with your father .
the man is out of his mind .
he said to tell me the whole truth .
it's the only way for you to be forgiven .
we told you the whole truth .
we know nothing .
chief , you are too nice .
give them to me .
i'll make them sing , these criminals , with a good beating !
did you hear?
why do you want to get beat up , and end up in a dark cell with rats?
to defend who?
three criminals?
i'd understand if it were someone in your family , but you , you are all alone .
and you , your parents are poor but honest people .
listen , chief , you can kill us if you want , but we can't tell you what we don't know .
too bad !
the smaller one .
don't worry , your turn will come .
undress him .
take off his shirt too .
do you want to speak?
no , please , enough !
that's enough !
then have you made up your mind?
give me the names .
we don't know anything , i swear .
enough , enough .
i'll tell you everything .
so?
one is called panza .
the other is attilio , giuseppe's brother .
the third i don't know , i swear ...
i never saw him before .
giuseppe !
take him to his cell .
well , let's go .
what about this guy?
giuseppe .
pasquale .
so , did they hurt you?
no , what about you?
me neither !
didn't they use the belt on you? are you kidding?
you didn't say anything , did you?
no , no , i didn't say anything .
i told you to come here , damn it !
what did he want?
nothing , he wanted to know if they beat me up .
what happened to you?
nothing .
why?
you should see your face .
it's my face .
if you don't like it ... don't look at it .
why are you here?
do you have a visitor?
no , nobody .
then what are doing here?
mario , take him .
i'm busy .
you watch him .
come here .
my mother , where is she?
di dio .
that's me .
she's not my mother .
his mother sent me .
she wrote asking me to come and see you .
here's the postcard .
where is she?
in florence .
she went to florence , but she'll come soon , you know .
i brought you this package .
there is a lot of stuff in it .
thank you .
goodbye .
take care , my boy .
good morning .
good morning .
pasquale , my mother is here .
i'll see you in the courtyard .
giuseppe !
come on , move !
mom !
do you forgive me , mama?
how could you do something like this?
i wasn't involved , mama .
we didn't know anything ... and didn't do anything !
he is a criminal , i know .
he is wretched ... but he is your brother .
you must not spy on him .
what are you saying , mama?
don't pretend .
the police chief told me it was you two that talked .
okay , okay , attilio is nothing , but you !
raffaele , kiss him for me .
tell him his mother will be back soon .
she'll bring money for a lawyer , so he can get out quickly .
things are very good for me in florence .
much better than rome .
your devoted , teresa di dio .
how far is florence?
not far .
i know someone who has a truck and drives there once a week .
then it's close !
eat , pasquale !
no , thank you .
take some , take it .
don't touch that .
it's his stuff !
he's sick , he needs it !
spy , spy , spy ...
what happened?
you should be ashamed .
we give you a little freedom and you take advantage of it immediately .
what happened?
he's a spy .
that's not true !
behave , boys !
i don't want to pay because of you .
behave !
i don't want to get rusty in here because of you .
behave !
behave , boys !
i need to speak with you .
what do you want?
none of your business .
who says so?
i say so .
listen , napoli , you get off easier because you are sick , but watch what you say .
okay .
you don't want to speak with me?
if you're bringing a message from that spy you'd better save your breath .
you don't have much of it to spare .
good , you gave him a good answer .
hey , riccardo .
go , giuseppe , now is the time .
you've got to go .
you swore .
if you don't , you're a coward .
what are you saying?
of course you're going !
mr. staffera , in cell number 9 they have a file .
what?
they're hiding a file .
damn it !
maybe if i'd spoken to him i'd have convinced him .
you're smart , but that was wrong .
he's the one who has to come and apologize .
i don't understand , you were such good friends .
you liked each other .
it's a shame .
me , i still like him .
but if he ...
those in cell 9 .
whose file is this?
who does it belong to?
whose file is this?
who knows?
whose file is this?
i swear by the mother of christ ... !
whose file is this?
i don't know .
never saw it before .
whose file is this?
i don't know !
get out , get out .
who does it belong to?
i swear on my honor that ...
who sleeps here?
i do .
this file was found in your mattress .
it can't be .
it can't be?
then , i'm a liar , is that it?
no , i mean , it's not mine .
i didn't put it there .
then you're accusing your mates of putting it in there?
i'm not accusing anybody .
the file is yours .
who gave it you?
what were you gonna do?
nothing .
nobody gave it to me .
it's not mine , you see , it's not mine .
out !
out !
all of you !
no , no , enough !
stop it !
stop it !
inside .
lock them in .
stop crying !
you twit .
don't you remember you sent your brother to jail?
everybody will know it was you who spied on staffera .
dry your tears , baby .
here comes staffera .
what's your name?
filippucci giuseppe .
good .
if he becomes head of the group we've got it made .
now look at him ... stupid !
stop it !
are you feeling sick?
i'm burning all over .
my father has a very helpful ointment .
i'd like to know who put the file there .
when i find out , i'll smash his head , i swear to god !
even if i end up at regina cieli .
come on , pasquale , they all think you spied so you have to understand ...
but it's not true !
hey , napoli , what's his story?
did he spy or not?
drop dead !
you could have told me .
i told raffaele .
at first , even he didn't believe me .
me?
yes !
imagine the others !
now , i don't care if they believe me or not .
i want to know who put the file in the mattress .
just forget about it .
it's over .
over?
i mean ... well , okay ... tomorrow i'll talk to giuseppe .
you have to make peace , okay?
for me !
yes , for you , i'll get him to make peace .
it's impossible to sleep in here .
stop all that !
i spoke with him .
come .
he's the one that has to come to me .
my goodness , what a pair you are !
he says you have to come , you sayhe has to come .
let's compromise .
just meet halfway , okay?
okay , halfway .
finally !
damn it !
what bad shape they put you in !
did you go to the doctor?
no .
be careful , he washes you with soap .
does it hurt?
yes , it hurts , but it'll go away .
so , did you make up your mind?
damn it !
you're making such a fuss !
listen , boy ... did you tell him who put the file in the mattress?
no , i didn't tell him .
and not even who asked me to do it .
as far as i'm concerned , you can tell him .
what should i do?
whatever you want .
if you have the courage to help the person that sent your brother to jail ... go ahead .
you heard what righetto said , he did it because he thought they were beating me up .
damn it !
don't listen to that moron .
moron?
watch your mouth !
it's the truth , giuseppe .
go ahead !
show them what you're made of .
come on !
help , help , they're killing him !
tends to be violent , dangerous to himself and others .
we recommend isolation .
master !
master !
what is it?
i want to go to the bathroom .
just use what's in there .
i see , but then ...
i don't care .
i'm not the one staying in there .
you call that a horse?
what do you know !
besides , i don't like horses , they're too slow !
you don't know bersagliere !
he flies !
who is bersagliere?
never mind .
you don't know him .
someone give me a cigarette .
and how do we get them?
i went to the infirmary .
we can see .
idiots !
i mean i've got everything ready ... to escape .
yes , but i'm the idiot wasting my time talking to you guys .
no , no , we're listening .
with you i'll never be able to put anything together .
why?
we're ready .
you shut up !
indeed , i won't say anything just because of you .
what did i do to you?
you ganged up with pasquale .
yes , it's true .
no , it isn't true .
in fact , when i saw you on the floor looking like you were dead ...
okay , okay ...
so , when entering the infirmary ...
damn this one !
do you want to shut up?
so ... the fence ... it's fastened to the wall with an iron bar .
i've got everything ready .
really?
i cut through a lot of bolts .
you just need to shake it hard to break it open .
i figured from the windowsill to the roof below there's just about a couple of yards .
filippucci?
here !
you have a visitor .
here he is , counselor .
thank you .
come here , my dear .
we have a lot to discuss .
i've been sent by bonavino , the lawyer hired by your family to defend you and your brother ...
attilio ...
attilio filippucci .
your name is giuseppe?
yes .
your friend is ...
pasquale maggi?
yes .
and his family?
he has no family .
very well , it's better that way .
our defense is that you didn't want nor did you understand .
you have to say it was maggi that lured you into selling .
to do what?
you have to say you knew nothing but your friend was aware of everything .
pasquale also knew nothing .
it was my brother who arranged everything .
well , good .
repeat that in court and you'll guarantee your brother is in for five years .
but it's the truth .
save the truth for your confessor .
in court , you say what i tell you .
this famous horse could not have been bought , as the defense would want us to believe , with hard earned money .
it was money from illegal activities .
that's absurd !
the stolen goods have been recovered .
where is the horse now?
don't answer .
if i didn't know you well , counselor ,
i would think that in your vocabulary
horse " is synonymous with " lawyer's fee .
you must be joking !
why did you buy the horse?
to ride him !
ah , to ride him .
is that so?
it's the truth .
how much did you plan on making from him?
sergeant , bring in maggi .
i bring to the attention of the court that maggi has been characterized as " tends to be violent .
we recommend isolation .
so , when did you buy the horse?
ex cuse me , your honor ,
i don't understand why the horse is so important .
i'll tell you why .
who are you defending , maggi or the filippucci brothers?
the filippuccis .
i've been hired by the family .
maggi is with carbone , a public defender .
how much did each of you own of the horse?
that is , what was your share and what was filippucci's share?
we each have half .
did you sign any papers to that effect?
no .
if there were a dispute between the two of you , how could you prove ownership?
can you tell us where the horse is hidden?
don't answer !
the accused doesn't have to answer that !
who is that?
who knows?
maybe the queen .
where are you going?
hold on .
you can't go through .
stop !
stop !
you can't go inside !
a roman emperor
i can't remember his name called his horse " senator .
man , he speaks good .
why be surprised if two poor boys , two kids living on the street put all their money ... all their hopes on a horse?
i've seen him .
what's the counselor saying?
he is talking about the horse .
did you ever ride a horse?
no , but i'd like to try .
can't you keep quiet or not?
who's talking?
you don't need to be a doctor in psychology to understand the overbearing influence that maggi had on his friend , the little innocent giuseppe .
just look at him .
who wouldn't want him as a son?
i'm not accusing maggi .
that's the district attorney's job .
let's go .
we've got to be brave .
my poor sons !
don't be like that .
shouldn't we go back inside?
no .
who's saying these innocent boys had a house , a family , school , a job?
this is not a crime .
should they then be considered criminals?
if so , ladies and gentlemen , you must condemn all of us , as we are the people who , in pursuit of our passions , abandon the children to fend for themselves .
and our children are alone .
all alone .
mr. cadore , your turn .
i'll be brief , as is my custom .
on the other hand ,
i did not have the time to delve into the details of this case .
therefore , i will entrust my client to the fatherly clemency of the court and i ask for a complete acquittal , or a very light sentence .
very , very light .
marcello !
... in addition , sentence the youth maggi pasquale to two years and six months in prison and a 2 , 000 lira fine , and filippucci giuseppe to one year in prison and a 1 , 000 lira fine .
without appeal .
giuseppe , giuseppe !
you rascals !
you villains !
here they come !
poor boys , my poor sons !
giuseppe !
attilio .
oh , here he is , finally !
we thought they'd put you in front of the firing squad .
how did it go?
i got a year , but i don't care .
where is riccardo?
he's gone to meet his mother .
she has to give him the money .
then , you've changed your mind? are you crazy?
this morning , sicilia and i went to the infirmary .
he's still there and everything's in place .
i wish i could see the face of the district attorney
when he finds out i've escaped !
how much did pasquale get?
two years .
that much !
and why?
what happened?
that stupid woman didn't come , she sent my father instead .
but  but what?
we're escaping anyway , right?
without money?
they'd catch us again tomorrow !
what about me?
they gave me one year , don't you understand?
i don't want to stay here .
i want to get out !
shut up , you idiot !
do you want to ruin everything?
you're worried about one year?
without money there's no breaking out !
that's why i asked my mother for 10 , 000 lira , but the stupid woman told my father .
he figured it out , and now he wants to talk to the director .
he's going to have me put in isolation .
he told me i have to " serve , " i have to pay for it .
damn him !
he says i'm the disgrace of the family .
they're ashamed of me .
i've got money .
where?
i've got it .
how much?
over 50 , 000 lira .
look , they're here .
here come the entertainers .
what are you showing tonight?
something good? are we going to see naked legs?
a comedy would be better .
they're showing a movie .
big deal !
last time they showed something silly
like we were still in kindergarten .
i like it .
i've never been to the movies .
so?
did you have to come to jail for that?
we're lucky .
they feed us , they shelter us , give us clothes , they even entertain us .
what else could you want?
it's a swell bargain .
news from the free world
in the pacific ocean , general macarthur continues the successful campaign against the japanese .
bougainville is the target of a strong off ensive carried out by the navy and air and ground forces .
the attack is being led by the destroyers .
pasquale the ocean !
the american forces are on land , one step closer to japan itself .
open open the window .
lights !
the lights , please !
what are you laughing about?
hey , you kids !
what are you doing there?
damn it , we've been caught !
why didn't you wait?
open up , open up !
open up !
what is it?
they've jammed the lock and locked themselves inside .
how many are they?
i've seen two .
open up , boys !
open up !
open up !
stop !
lights !
the lights , the lights !
calm down , for heaven's sake !
calm down !
there's no danger .
turn on the lights .
lights , lights !
master , master !
my god , it's raffaele !
let's take him to the infirmary .
open up !
open up !
open up , boys !
open up !
boys !
come back !
boys !
come back or i'll shoot !
boys , consider the consequences !
boys !
boys !
boys !
i want to go away .
i want to leave too !
go , go !
take him back to his cell !
five or six have escaped .
sound the alarm , surround the building .
come on , where is your cell?
i want to see him .
tomorrow .
we have to wait for the doctor .
what if he's dead?
let's hope not .
now come .
to the cells .
take them to their cells .
i told you to take them to their cells .
arcangeli has escaped .
who's escaped?
arcangeli , giuseppe and five others .
really?
there were more than 20 .
and napoletano is dead .
dead?
yes , but they caught them .
idiot !
they had a car waiting !
giuseppe had the horse too .
a horse?
what horse?
did you hear that?
they had a horse too .
where did they keep a horse?
the guards !
stop !
stop there , boys !
come on , we've got them
come on , come on !
bartoli , get the forms ready for tomorrow .
and the report .
one page is enough .
tomorrow?
maybe i won't be here .
where will you be?
i don't think this is the right place for me .
i don't even know where the right place for me is , but in here you need people tougher than me ... tougher than me .
in any case , there was nothing to be done .
the poor boy his days were numbered .
don biagioni , i'm devastated .
it's my fault .
it's my fault .
calm down , calm down .
it was an accident .
we caught them .
there are two missing the criminal arcangeli , and filippucci , the little one who was sentenced this morning .
we informed the police .
they won't get far .
you don't believe they could leave town?
where would they go?
without money , dressed as inmates , they can't go around naked in winter .
unless the families help them out , and that's unlikely .
i know dr. arcangeli and filippucci's folks are poor .
you can't imagine the troubles we'll have with the department .
mr. staffera !
what do you want?
i know where they went .
who?
arcangeli and giuseppe .
where?
i'll take you there .
he's not here .
i knew it .
they took him away .
look over there !
what happened?
what did they do to you?
my head hurts .
they beat me up the big one .
where did they go?
i don't know .
they came , they wanted the horse .
they said it was theirs .
my head hurts .
they beat me up .
the bigger one ...
get down !
no , no , pasquale , no !
giuseppe?
giuseppe !
giuseppe ...
giuseppe !
mother of god , what have i done?
what have i done?
giuseppe !
the end
