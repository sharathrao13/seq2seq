ten years ago , a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court ... for a crime they didn" t commit .
these men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the los angeles underground .
today , still wanted by the government , they survive as soldiers of fortune .
if you have a problem , if no one else can help , and if you can find them ... maybe you can hire ... the a team .
murdock , relax .
you" re gettin " fidgety .
this is unit 24 . just spotted suspects 'van going east .
suspects have spotted me .
am in pursuit .
attention all units .
suspects have been seen on highway 15 heading east in a black van with red trim .
mobilize all local , county and state units .
advise caution .
this is hamilton county sheriff .
we are in pursuit to the county line .
we read you , hamilton county .
we" il take it from there .
step on it , b. a.
the local heat" s closing in .
head for the construction site .
xray 1 is out of the chase .
b. a. , will you make up your mind?
which way you goin "?
shut up , you crazy fool .
all units stand by .
no offence , colonel , but wasn" t that a little risky?
maybe .
but we can" t be late for ray" s funeral .
he was too good a friend .
keep your eyes wide , guys .
we still got a long way to go .
come on .
lynch has almost caught us twice already .
once in arizona ...
and then again driving through texas .
that wasn't even close in texas .
the point is he has an idea which direction we're travelling .
now , since we don" t want to be chased out of barlow creek ... at least for a couple of days ...
i think maybe we should try and be extra cautious .
i know how hard it is for you guys to stay out of trouble .
trouble?
i don't start no trouble .
i mind my own business .
going up to a traffic cop ... who is writing out a ticket for your van and eating the citation right in front of his face ... absolutely falls under starting trouble .
well , you gotta admit ... the look on that cop's face was worth it .
all right , all right .
we all agree not to eat any more parking tickets .
all this talk about food has made me hungry .
murdock , we were talking about eating parking tickets .
well , to a human garbage disposal anything's appetizing .
uh , uh , b. a.?
let him go , man .
gotta get some gas .
yeah , we've gotta get directions to the cemetery too .
we'll meet you back here .
funerals tend to ruin my appetite .
i'll be with you in a minute .
just go ahead and , uh , sit anywhere .
we've got some terrific specials today .
sounds great .
i haven't told you what they were .
ah , you don't have to .
looks like he got his appetite back , huh?
in full force .
yeah , i ...
i started to feel a little weak .
well , that's a pretty wild looking truck you got there , mister .
you sure ain't from around here , are you , huh?
no , you sure ain't from around here .
no , you ain't from around here .
no , you ain't from around here .
well , do you have a cemetery around here?
a cemetery?
hey , have we got a cemetery .
the fact is people's dyin 'to get in there .
you get it?
you see , " dying "?
you know , dyin 'to get in .
i'll bet johnny carson's holding his breath waiting for you to drop out of the sky ... but could you tell us where the cemetery is so we won't be late?
late?
for what?
ain't no one being buried out there today exceptin 'ray brenner ... and no one's allowed to go to that funeral .
why is no one allowed , harold?
'cause the watkins said so .
who?
oh , you surely are from way off .
the watkins .
me and deke and logan and c. w.
we all says you can't go to the cemetery .
ray brenner's funeral is exactly where we're going .
we can discuss this at greater depth when i get back .
then , i'm not gonna ...
i'm not gonna fill you up to go out ...
do you know what you're doin '?
you know what logan's gonna do when he finds out about this?
he's ...
do ya?
huh?
he's gonna make you pay .
well , that's good .
because when it comes to paying up , i've got a great line of credit .
what was all that about?
that guy's crazier than murdock .
beats me , b. a.
this is the last piece .
i hope it's still fresh .
l" m gonna be making up a new batch this evening , so maybe if you" re gonna be around later ...
i'll definitely be around .
i'm in town for a friend's funeral .
oh , you're friends of ray's?
yeah , we were in vietnam together .
well , tell trish that i'm sorry .
dad and i won't be coming .
you know the brenners well?
yeah .
i'm doing an article on how small american towns honour their war heroes .
lianne , got people" s food getting cold .
okay , dad .
## [ singing ]
oh , lianne .
hey , uh , you're sittin 'in my stool .
are you kidding?
no , that's ... that's my stool .
i sit there all the time .
oh , yeah?
remember ray's funeral .
yeah , but , uh ...
but what?
but what , pally?
huh?
oh , not you , gorgeous .
gorgeous , sit down .
you know , you're so flattering , i almost can't stand it .
you're kind of cute yourself .
how's the , uh , soup , c. w.?
oh , it needed a little salt .
how much do we owe you?
you don't owe nothin '.
you didn't eat nothin '.
why don't you have a little pie?
lianne here makes some of the best pie in the county .
we're all out of pie , deke .
you're out of pie today?
hey , have some of mine .
come on .
that does it .
oh , yeah?
what , you got a problem?
yeah , a medium sized one .
oh , yeah?
okay , let's go , guys .
come here .
i didn't ...
ow !
so you got a little problem here , huh?
there's no problem ... no problem at all .
ah , keep your stinkin 'pie anyway .
we don't want any trouble , so unless you want me to call the cops , you and your friends will get out .
what are you talking to us for?
what'd we do?
look , uh , i don't want trouble , okay?
uh , no trouble .
so , go .
please go .
i don't understand any of this .
what are you kicking us out for?
you going to ray's funeral?
that's right .
would you tell trish i'm sorry?
i'm real sorry .
why don't you tell her yourself?
no .
no , i can't .
uh , they'll be watching .
the watkins?
it's about time that somebody does somethin 'about those mangy animals .
who?
that rum soaked excuse for the law?
the story i sold my editor on doesn't exactly look like it's going to come together .
what in the world is going on here?
i don't know , but if you want to avoid trouble , i don't think this is the town to do it in .
we are not here to pay our respects to just a man ... but to spend one last moment with a friend ... a friend who ... who had something special .
someone who brought something to everyone who knew him .
raymond brenner rose up to take a stand for what he knew was right and just .
he wore courage and kindness like a badge of honour .
raymond may have moved on , and his wife , trish , and his friends will miss him dearly ... but the joy of his memories will live with us for the rest of our lives .
burying detail , attention , hut .
three steps forward .
ho !
forward , arms !
take aim .
burying detail ... fire !
fire !
fire !
order , arms !
the first time i tagged up with ray brenner ... he couldn" t have been more than two weeks out of special forces training .
the unit was on a search and destroy detail , had to blow up one of charlie" s supply bridges .
it got real hot ... but ray stood up like a guy born to do just that .
one time , charlie had the company pinned down .
it was my first firefight , and there was crying and screaming everywhere .
when i bailed out of thejeep and hit the dirt ...
i lost my helmet .
ray gave me his .
one night i was walking point and took a round in my leg .
i was bleedin " bad ... real bad .
then this white dude come up to me and dragged me over to the medevac .
ray brenner had a heart like i never seen .
there" s a difference between being brave ... and just crazy .
ray brenner was just brave .
he vectored me in through a hornet" s nest ... about a day from da nang ... and we pulled some grunts out of trouble .
my bird was the only one left in the sky .
knowing your trouble with the law and all , i still knew you'd be here .
i knew if you got my message in time , you'd all be here .
thank you for comin '.
we had to come , trish .
well , do you have to be going back?
i'd love for you to come by and see the place .
we have plenty of time .
good .
can i have a moment alone , please?
of course .
i'll wait by the pickup and ride back with you .
thank you .
it's been a long time .
yeah .
yeah .
he was a good man .
not much of a turnout for someone who was born and raised in this burg .
maybe trish can explain it .
well , put a hat on it , huh?
b. a. , check your mirror .
looks like someone" s knocking on the back door .
hang on , brother !
huh !
get off , face .
you're crushing my ...
what?
hannibal .
guys , are you okay?
yeah , we're just in here staying out of trouble .
there it is .
easy , b. a.
i'm gonna get them guys .
i'm gonna make 'em pay for messing up my ride .
then you'll pay for 30 years in a federal prison .
you do remember lynch?
i'll go talk to the sheriff .
the sheriff?
since when have we gone to the law for help?
first time for everything .
i'm gonna need that tow truck to get my van out of the ditch .
those guys broke my rear axle .
well , that's fitting , isn't it?
the watkins brothers own the only service station in this county .
they don" t let anyone else in their territory .
all l" m gonna do is ask the sheriff to send somebody in from tustin .
you guys will wait right here .
no trouble , right?
promise you'll wait .
promise .
oh , i knew i forgot something !
murdock , you comin "?
but i did promise .
what's a little white lie?
look , i can't go arrest people without proof .
i'm just tryin 'to sort out what you're givin 'me .
that's all .
so why don't you just drive on out to the cemetery and look at the van with its side bashed in?
comin 'out of the cemetery , huh?
you know what happened , jeff .
it sounds to me like you don't want to do anything at all .
look , trish .
you're not gonna go swearing out complaints against the watkins ... not if you intend to stay around here .
listen , jeff .
listen to me .
these men who were run off were friends of ray's .
they went overseas together .
do you understand me?
yeah .
they'll handle this the same way ray would have .
do you want that to happen again?
do ya?
lord's sake , jeff , they were just comin 'to my husband's funeral .
believe me , they're not looking for trouble .
ow !
what are you , crazy?
what do you guys want?
your tow truck drove my van off the road .
i want to know who was driving it .
is it clear now?
it's not me .
not me .
see , logan , he won't let me take the trucks .
where are the rest of the brothers grimm?
logan !
hey , logan !
where do you put the saddle?
long way from an army base , aren't ya?
these here are friends of ray brenner's .
why'd you run our van off the road?
you know what they're talkin 'about , harold?
how about you , curly?
they keep gettin 'bigger .
now , i told 'em how dangerous it was going on up the cemetery ... but they all had to learn just for themselves , didn" t ya?
is there any particular reason that nobody was supposed to go to ray" s funeral?
'cause i say so .
that's reason enough around here .
hey , we have gasoline here .
sign says no smokin '.
sorry .
are you nuts?
man said he didn't want me to smoke .
what do you think you're doin '?
what about my van?
you can file a complaint with the sheriff .
that's what most people do .
we're not most people .
uh ... what the ...
what's goin 'on around here , logan?
seems these fellas here have the idea we know something about a van they were driving .
yeah .
it was black , tinted windows , red detailing on the side .
just like that one right there .
hey , man , this is my van !
where's my wheels?
beats me .
say , sheriff .
how you doin ', sweet cheeks?
sheriff , why don't you ask them what they're doing with the van?
well , we're towin 'it in .
found it off the road up at cutter's way .
you gotta be careful up there .
they got some dangerous curves .
uh huh .
so we heard .
aw , yeah , baby .
yeah , baby .
b. a. , it" s her .
she recognizes me .
they stole my radio !
that" s the way we found it , man .
we don't have much vandalism around these parts , but up at cutter's way .
hey , man .
you better fix my van .
we'd be more than happy to do something about it .
we can find a couple of tyres for the thing , maybe find a radio .
unless you're looking for trouble from the law , you better keep real calm .
they" re not lookin " for trouble , sheriff .
they just came here to spend the day with me .
from what i can see , i'd say these fellas got every right to charge you for fixing your van .
thank you , sheriff .
now that'll be 50 bucks for the service charge ... and 25 bucks a mile for the tow .
just get it fixed .
we'll do our best .
that van better be in primo condition when we go back .
i cannot believe that even the sheriff is afraid of those creeps .
oh , poor jeff .
he was only a deputy when the last sheriff disappeared .
disappeared?
yeah , he was in the woods up north and just never got back .
word was he may have gotten hurt and couldn" t call for help , but he was on his way to talk to the watkins .
of course , logan and his brothers say he never got there .
how can an entire town let them get away with something like that?
because we know they're crazy .
you don't dare look at 'em wrong .
you can't even charge 'em when they come in your store .
they can take anything they want from anyone .
i mean , who" s gonna stand up to" em?
i'll bet ray did .
right .
and now he's dead .
when he saw what the watkins were doing , it drove him crazy .
when he tried to say something , no one would back him up .
he couldn" t be one man against five .
i kept tellin " him that .
so he tried to look the other way .
then one day he heard ... that while i was in town deke had grabbed me while i was in the grocery store .
ray went berserk .
he followed him into town .
those bullet holes in the gas station wall .
yeah , he shot up the station .
then there was a fight .
he hurt him pretty bad .
the accident was the next day ... hit and run , no witnesses .
tsk .
oh , lord .
take it easy , trish .
trish , i'd like to borrow your pickup .
not unless you're gonna use it to get out of barlow .
what happened to ray is enough .
sure is .
ray was one of the only men who stuck by us during the trial .
he was a friend , and friends always do for one another .
just because he's gone , that don't mean we don't owe him .
what are you gonna do?
well , pick up b. a. 's van .
we gave 'em two hours .
i figure their time's about up .
i'm here for my van .
yeah , well , logan ain't here right now .
yeah , well , where is he?
we said two hours .
it's been two hours .
logan don" t go letting people tell him what he should and shouldn" t do .
maybe that's logan's problem .
look , you just don't want to understand .
you don't go messing with no watkins .
around here it" s watkins " law .
yes , sir .
go ask your widow friend .
she'll tell ya .
she already did .
hannibal .
yeah , well , let me tell you , if you come looking to get your butts handed to you ... you've come to the right place .
hannibal , allow me and murdock .
follow the yellow brick road .
lianne .
what are you gonna do , old man?
dad , it's okay .
i'm fine .
yeah , what's your problem , pal?
look , leave him alone , okay?
that man" s just eatin '.
let him finish .
yeah , well , he's finished .
beat it .
hey .
relax .
lianne , i'll be back tonight .
don" t be expecting pretty boy .
you see , i got him out looking for some wheels .
well , well , well , well , well .
how's it goin ', deke?
oh , great .
i asked you fellas not to come back here .
i just stopped by to remind lianne about our date tonight .
and i still want to try that delicious pie l" ve heard so much about .
these guys just don't get the message .
oh , we get the message , all right .
don't we get the message , murdock?
i told you .
it needed a little more salt .
that'll take care of any damages .
i'll see you tonight .
we do good work .
we certainly do .
go see about my van .
we get 65 a mile and a hundred bucks service .
hey .
hey .
hey !
what do you want?
i want that .
you better know i called curly and logan .
i called 'em .
they're comin 'on ove ...
shut up !
they're comin 'over here .
bring 'em over here .
now , where's our stuff?
now , have you had your 10, 000 mile checkup?
no , they're in there !
they're in there !
well , well , well .
just like christmas .
okay , you guys stripped 'em .
put 'em back on .
move it !
yeah , baby .
yeah , baby .
see , i told you we " d come back .
hannibal .
guess what's missing .
looking for these?
on your feet !
now it looks a whole lot better , don't it?
well , it surely does !
it surely does !
keep your heads down .
get up .
you guys come back into our town and you" re dead .
let's go , c. w.
by the way , deke and harold are gonna take care of your girlfriend .
it's those maniacs .
amy , what are we gonna do?
anything we can to keep those creeps from getting their hands on us .
why don't i pay more attention when the guys do this?
here .
let me .
oh , it's empty .
do you have any bullets?
ray must have ... someplace .
okay , go get 'em and check every window , trish .
got it .
i'm here , darlin '!
your first prize !
l" m all yours , sweetie !
hey , now .
come on .
open up .
now your boyfriends have gone and run off .
so it's just us , darlin '.
just the two of us !
hey !
open up !
i'm gonna go check out the side .
come on !
the next one ain't gonna get by .
darlin '!
open up !
get outta here !
open this stinkin 'door !
deke !
deke !
she burned out my eyes !
kill her !
i wanna get out of here !
no way !
people are gonna take advantage if you don't stand up for what you think is right .
it doesn't pay to sit back ...
what is this?
whoa .
hey .
whoa .
this is a beautiful automobile .
please , sir .
we need your car .
i'm awfully sorry , ma'am .
we have to take your car .
here's $450 .
we'll take real good care of it .
arnold , say something .
we'll bring it back as good as new .
well , how long you gonna keep it?
we'll send a cab for you right away .
where are they going?
i don" t know .
don't worry .
amy , hold these .
come on , baby !
open up !
open up the door , baby !
i've got a gun !
open up .
whoo ! lt" s party time , girls !
let us in .
get under that desk .
i'm warning you !
i've got a gun !
you hear that , deke?
she's got a gun .
bull !
oh !
this chick is nuts !
it's empty !
here comes their crazy friends .
well , it's time to leave .
come on .
i'm gonna fire .
amy , you all right?
it's them .
face?
oh , guys .
you got any more ammo?
it" s all over the place .
empty .
trish , does that tractor out in the yard work?
i think so .
i'll check it out .
are you gonna go after 'em?
we tried staying out of trouble .
it didn't seem to work for us .
listen , amy , there's a car outside .
take it to a nice , little old couple ...
who should be waiting for you on route 4 , near the barlow turn off .
trish , where's the rest?
the rest?
yeah .
ray always kept weapons .
and those bullet holes in that gas station came from automatic fire .
in the bedroom closet .
the keys are on the dresser .
they probably just come back for the girl .
let's take a ride out there and see .
hey , dirtballs !
yo , curly , c. w. , the guns .
well , you boys got an awful lot of stupid in ya .
i got a thing about living with cockroaches .
my friends and i are gonna do some exterminating .
you should have left town while you had the chance .
that was our next line .
especially since you guys aren't gonna have anyplace to hang out any more .
we're the neighbourhood beautification committee .
we clean up neighbourhoods .
what are you talking about?
you forgot to check the oil .
harold , get back here !
harold?
drop 'em , or i'll cut ya in half !
i need some volunteer deputies .
get over here .
sheriff , deputize 'em .
uh , you guys are hereby deputized .
good .
and here's some dried blood ... scraped off of the front bumper of their tow truck .
have it analysed .
i'm sure it'll be ray brenner's type .
yeah .
put 'em away .
okay , let's take 'em in , boys .
hey .
oh , come on , b. a. it's not so bad .
you had to rotate these tyres anyway .
hey , man , why you always trying your crazy logic on me when bad things keep happening to us?
every cloud has a silver lining .
when the going gets tough , the tough get going .
shut up , murdock !
shut up !
# if you want to dance to the music #
# you got to pay the piper ##
how do you like this one?
dead men tell no tales .
oh , yeah .
i'm gonna go talk to hannibal .
you know , hannibal , i think you made a mistake .
you should have sprayed those guys purple .
you know , billy always turns purple just before he gets mad .
you should have sprayed 'em yellow because they're cowards .
considering where they're going , i think stripes would be appropriate .
you gotta admit , fellas .
they do stand out .
now , trish , you sure you're gonna be all right?
this is a pretty big place for a woman alone .
i'm gonna be fine .
i can afford to hire somebody .
with the watkins brothers behind bars , maybe i can make this the kind of farm ray always wanted .
anyhow , i got help on the way .
and remember , ray has many friends who will remember him .
