the name of this course is " american terrorism " .
200 years ago , we fought a revolution in the name of certain beliefs of liberty , of justice for all , of self rule and self reliance .
they are many in this country who feel we have not yet won that war .
terrorist acts , violent political theater , have been a part of social dissent in this country since its inception .
but why?
why in this land of freedom?
what's led men to such bloodshed in the name of their beliefs?
why in this era of prosperity has the anti government movement been at it's peak?
and what's that going to mean when the prosperity fades?
fewer of us are voting and more of us are joining the ranks of a resistence .
how long are we going to call these numbers insignificant?
what do they have to teach us?
wlfe and mother leah faraday 1961 1996 defender of country .
i'm going to explore .
only woman i ever liked having around that was smarter than me .
whit carver , generous to a fault .
hey there , mr. faraday .
how's he doing?
he's alright .
we're still seeing his counsellor .
she says he's improving but he still keeps to himself a lot .
how's his dad doing?
he's alright .
you still seeing this graduate student?
she says he's improving ... ... but he still keeps to himself a lot .
michael , this kid i'm partnered with is a walking laptop , cyberspace geek !
put him across from some real life bad guys , he's surprised to see 'em .
i ought to make him take your course .
you teaching it again?
yes .
she'd like that .
i know what that'd mean to her .
my invitation is still good , for you to come as a guest .
i'd rather not stand trial for you , michael .
not what it would be .
i know what it would be .
how's work?
you know , ... routine .
that's what i miss , the conversation about work .
i'd tell her about my day , she couldn't tell me a thing .
you wouldn't think i'd miss that , but i do .
have me over to dinner some time .
i'll keep some state secrets from you , make you feel like she never left .
do people remember her , whit?
what do you mean?
at the bureau .
do they remember or do people forget?
they remember , michael , they do .
leah died for her country .
she shouldn't have .

i knew his family .
i knew leah .
this thing is kind of ... new between us .
you're so sweet together .
i think the world of him .
he's such a good man , such a good father .
this job was just too appealing to pass up .
contracts were down all over st. louis .
how long were you in st. louis?
about 4 years .
i grew up on a farm , a place called carson in kansas .
i never lived east before .
kids will see their first ocean .
i'm afraid downtown is falling apart .
that's what i hear .
we're not in kansas anymore , toto .
hannah !
bedtime .
grant !
be careful of his hand !
i got two hands !
it's been a long time since i've see him just being a kid .
sometimes ... since his mother ... he's had a tough time making friends .
we all need friends .
llfe just isn't the same without them .
dad?
yes?
how do you spell " restricted "?
restricted " r e s t ...
you know how to use the dictionary , what are you doing?
building a compound .
a compound?

alright .
just so i know you're not going to use any fireworks in there , brady .
general brady , dad .
no fireworks , general brady .
that's classified information , mr. faraday .
you don't know the secret handshake .
i'm serious , brady .
come on , grant .

we're going to get dinner on .
ollver lang st .
arllngton rd .
michael , hi .
come in .
i got something for you in my mailbox .

no , i went to kansas state , class of '78 .
they must have me mixed up with someone else .
same class?
yes but at k state .
it's a reunion .

sorry about the mess , cheryl and the girls are at a church group .
i'm trying to catch up on a little work .
how are you?
good , good .
how's grant?
he's doing great .
excuse me a minute .
why don't i call you back?
what do you mean?
you're kidding?
we should really talk in person about this .
i can work on this tonight .
hold on a second .
this project is taking forever to get together .
the client can't seem to make up his mind .
this the reston mall?
yes , i'm getting it on track .
i'm sorry , i have to ...
are we going to see each other this weekend?
yes !
the junior d's .
the thing brady keeps talking about .
he'll love it and make more friends than he'll know what to do with .
they do campouts , they do trips .
they give you ...
they give you the house to yourself , every now and then .
you and brooke , i mean .
thank you , neighbor .
for what?
for having a 10 year old next door .
what do you know about shopping malls?
shopping malls .
i was at the langs talking with oliver .
he had this blueprint on his counter .
he said it was the reston mall .
that's the one he's working ...
but it wasn't .
it wasn't?
i looked , brooke .
it was a building , not a mall .
right , it's an addition .
no .
it was an office building .
it wasn't stores at all .
so , it's some other project .
why would he tell me it was a mall if it wasn't?
why would he lie?
michael , when you took engineering in college , what grades did you get?
i didn't take engineering .
what i saw was an office building .
14 months ago , on a monday in junuary , over 60 federal employees went to work like they always did at the roosevelt federal building in downtown st. louis .
except on that monday , they didn't come home .
ln a truck parked in front was hidden of c 4 plastic explosives .
when it was detonated it disintegrated the entire street side of the building , obliterating dozens of government offices , the building's daycare center , and the st. louis branch of the lnternal revenue service , which was ultimately determined to be the target of the attack .
the truck was leased by this
dean scobee .
he had served prison time for tax evasion .
surveillance video showed he has inside the vehicle ,
leaving him among the 63 dead .
does anyone not remember this?
we all know the results of the investigation .
the said scobee acted alone .
one man .
no conspirators .
right?
he cheated the lrs , they caught him at it , so he blew them up .
this is a guy who people described as average ... friendly .
he'd been in the army but as a radio man .
he had a very little experience with munitions .
his parents considered him a moderate conservative .
and 2 weeks prior to this , he received a pay raise at his electrician's job !
that sound like a man on the edge?
or a man who needed a push?
i don't know .
i'm just asking .
professor , the feds did this huge investigation .
that's right , an investigation , i forgot .
well , the investigation didn't satisfy me .
miss o'neal , when you first heard the news terrorist attack in your own country , how did that make you feel?
come on !
what did you feel?
angry , scared , stressed .
did you feel safe?
no .
then the next day , when they found scobee dead , did you feel some relief?
some safety return?
the people in that building , they felt safe , secure , just like you feel now .
then in an instant later , in an instant ,
they were gone forever .
we needed to have this man to blame .
we don't want others .
we want one name and we want it fast , because it gives us our security back .
we can say ,
here was the one man , unlike the rest of us .
we named him and he is no more .
his reasons are gone too .
but the truth is , we don't know why scobee did it .
why it came to this !
we can pretend we do , for 10 grand in taxes , but we don't know .
and we'll never know .
still we feel safe
because we know his name .
as god is my witness ...
i promise to give ... friendship to those in need ... ... friendship to those in need ...
help to those in trouble .
i will work with faith and honor .
i will work with faith and honor .
to uphold the discoverer code .
to uphold the discoverer code .
to respect myself .
my family ...
and my country .
ladies and gentlemen , please welcome junior discovery troop 474 .
this is oliver's study , where get away from the kids and me .
these are all projects you've worked on?
i wish .
no ...
i collect sketches , blueprints , designs of old buildings .
the front of view of monticello .
there's the woolworth building .
it's his hobby .
the st. louis arch .
yes , correct .
then all these drawings are not just for your job?
no .
so , they're not all shopping mall .
no , i don't know of any architecturally significant shopping malls .
you just haven't built them yet !
who's hungry?
i'm famished .
come on , i got some really delicious puff pastry .
they've to work so hard when they're there .
you have to keep them in their seats .
politically , there's something to be said for that .
here we're leaving the church .
everyone thought we were off to mexico .
where were you going?
the plane never left the ground .
we had engine trouble .
we couldn't wait , so we spent our wedding night at the witchita airport motel .
how romantic .
for $19 it was wonderful .
how long you two been married?
12 years .
what kind of example is that for everybody else?
i don't think we learn responsibility from politicians .
we really learn it from family . is the people that we care about and who they care about .
my dad died when i was a teenager .
i'm sorry .
car accident .
my father mostly .
you get yours from?
my values?
probably from my wife .
values?
what values?
we were talking about where you get your values from , and we were both saying that's mostly from family .
where else are you gonna get them?
celebrities?
politicians?
not in this century .
it's a sorry state of affairs , when you can't find a role model .
it's not even role models necessarily , it's just people who acknowledge the consequences of their actions .
or pay for those actions .
we should put some of these politicians in jail .
oliver , you can't ask government to be infallible .
but you can ask it to be accountable .
i can ask it to be honest .
when leah died , all i wanted was someone to tell me ,
we made a mistake
we made a mistake , your wife suffered for it ... and we'd take it back a hundred times if we could
but ... they don't say that .
she would have .
some of them knew her .
they work so hard at being able to look at you in the eye .
excuse me .
leave him alone .
he's fine .
sorry .
it's okay .
i see how much you miss her .
these are just times when you ... realize how much of your own life is out of your hands .
what are you gonna do?
i guess you can have faith .
try to make a difference where you can with grant ... ... with your classes .
what about you?
i got my family .
and the buildings i leave behind .
that's it .
get your shoulder up a little .
step into it .
watch that ball until it hits the bat .
that's it !
you want some cracker jack?
you sure?
popcorn and caramel , it builds your muscles .
alright .
out of the way , faraday .
he's getting confidence up there .
he's a strong kid .
who's been dealt some hard breaks .
that's a way to swing .
you give him strength , michael .
i'm trying .
you do .
getting on with your life .
that's important for him to see .
he just wishes someone had to pay .
what?
for his mother .
he wishes someone had to pay .
he's talked to you about her?
her people send her in with the wrong information then say , " not my fault " .
i can't live with that .
or you .
let alone a 9 year old boy .
he talked to you about his mother?
yeah .
i hope that's alright .
we talk about a lot things .
he's a smart kid .
way to go , grant .
never more wise than when we're children .
they say it and it's true .
we'll never see things that clear again .
let me have a hit .
grant !
grant !
grant , it's dinner time !
wash your hands !
i'm eating with brady !
no .
come now .
brady invited him over for dinner .
i thought he asked you .
can i eat with brady , dad?
ollver lang , thlstlewood way st .
louls , mlssourl .
okay , if his dad says it's alright .
ls it all right , kids?
good afternoon , u penn .
transcript office , please .
transcripts .
i'm calling from g. w. university .
we have a student who's applied for work in our history department . and i need to verify his undergrad record with you .
he's been out of school for some time .
the name is oliver lang .
are you telling me you took this out of his mail box?
that is illegal .
tell me you don't think this sound strange .
the u. penn , keeps sending alummni stuff for a20 year reunion .
he says he went to kansas state , they have him mixed up .
i called penn and got his transcripts .
what?
why?
michael !
listen to me .
that guy has a completely different physical description .
he never took a class in engineering .
probably because they've got him mixed up with somebody else .
brooke , this u penn " oliver " is the same age as oliver .
wait as our?
as our oliver .
yes !
he graduated the same year and he comes from carson , kansas .
oliver's home town .
i'm lost here .
you just said they are two different people .
two people of the same age from the same small town .
it's a small town !
so what?
wouldn't they have heard of each other?
oliver didn't say anything like that .
he just threw the letter away .
wait a minute .
there could be 10 michael faradays in northern virginia ...
... and you'd never know it .
so , i called kansas state .
here's what i'm saying .
kansas state university ... had no oliver lang on record from that or any year .
either he didn't go to that school , or that's not his real name .
can i ask you something?
did you do this to me?
call up my ex boyfriends , get my transcripts sent over?
admit something's not right here .
no , this isn't right .
you invaded his privacy .
maybe he lied about his college .
people lie .
that doesn't give you the right to spy on them .
you of all people !
are you teaching the bill of rights , or did that not make the program?
i don't know what you're doing .
we've made some friends .
all right?
i'll see you later .
kansas state unlverslty class of 78
where is he?
fenimore !
'cause you've never been away from home !
you're 9 years old !
9 and a half .
there'll be grown ups !
the answer is no !
you said i could go .
now i'm saying you can't , go !
maybe you can go to summer camp , or something , okay?
brady's going !
brady might not be the best kid for you to be alone with .
dad ...
the answer is no !
he's my best friend .
grant , you want to go to camp so bad , we'll go to ...
aunt ruth and uncle rob's cabin .
it's a lie !
no , it's not .
you're too busy .
you'll forget !
like now !
we'll go up ...
you'll forget you said i could go !
hey there .
he lied to me .
the fbl keeps a file on every american charged with a crime .
now , certain offenses cause files to be " flagged " .
2 years ago , these " flags " , picked up a series of suspicious firearms purchases in maryland ,
georgia and the carolinas .
over 100 guns , from assault rifles , army issues , all bought by acquaintances of seaver parsons , husband , father of 3 , amateur gun collector , an outspoken member ... of the rightwing here in virginia .
to the fbl , parsons was stockpiling weapons for some sort of offensive .
they sent 4 fbl agents with a search warrant here , thinking they would uncover some sort of ... treasure chest of felony firearms .
munitions for war .
7 november , we got you eye balled .
back up's en route .
how do you want to handle it , boss?
the easy way .
yeah , i heard that .
hey there , mister .
catch yourself some dinner?
ls that your house there?
know if your father's home , son?
he don't know you .
no , son , we're from washington .
there , at this fence , they encountered parsons 'youngest son , age 10 .
they asked him where his father was , but ... failed to first identify themselves as federal agents .
run up and ask your daddy to come outside , because some people would like to speak to him .
okay?
cover the house !
no !
the back up will keep him .
no , cover the ...
the kid doesn't know why we're here .
they're here !
help !
they're coming !
back up !
he's just a kid !
they're here !
put the gun down !
cease fire !
pinned down , they returned fire .
finally , the reinforcements arrived .
when it was over , the seige lasted over two hours .
at the end ,
parsons 'two eldest sons were wounded .
his wife and his youngest boy were killed .
as for parsons ... he wasn't even home .
see , the fbl ... thought ... they were uncovering some sort of terrorist plot .
but what their files , their " flags " did not reveal to them ... was that seaver parsons had come into a family inheritance ... with which he had arranged the 100 legal firearms to be legally purchased !
nor did it tell them that parsons had recently applied for a sales licence .
nor did it tell them that parsons had warned his family ... that some people might want to steal his collection .
and he instructed his sons and his wife , and his daughter in law never ... to let strangers on his property while he was away .
and if force be taken , then to defend with force .
defend the home !
he had no love for the federal government .
he did have a separatist and suspicious past .
but this was not a terrorist .
he was not a criminal .
and 3 innocent people died that day ... because the " flags " went up .
and the " flags " were wrong .
don't dive in .
think for yourself .
i want you to be safe .
let go of my hand .
i want you to have a great time , okay?
listen to your troopmaster .
did brooke tell you to let me go?
yes , she did .
she said you're a big guy and you can handle 10 days away .
when i get back , is she going to take mom's place?
nobody is going to take mom's place , not brooke .
nobody .
mom is always going to be with us .
right here .
because we remember her like nothing could take her away .
lf brooke and i ever start thinking about something like that , we'll talk to you first .
she'll only live with us if mom says it's okay too .
okay .
you have a great time .
thanks for camp , dad .
you have a good one .
thanks , dad .
see you !
see you later .
his name was william fenimore , and i'm told he changed it to oliver lang .
it may take me a few moments , sir .
we do have william fenimore of carson , kansas , changed to an oliver lang .
do you know when that was?
october 5th , 1981 .
thank you .
that was exactly what i was looking for .
state of kansas .
records .
michael jones , i'm with the e. e. o. c. in washington .
i've got a possible name change i want to run by you guys .
i'm looking for an oliver lang , of carson , kansas .
hold on , sir .
sir?
we got nothing on any name change ... for an oliver lang , carson , kansas .
just doing my job .
thank you .
sir?
our record indicate ...
oliver lang deceased october 4th , 1981 .
october 4th?
yes , sir .
the 4th?
what does the death certificate say?
cause of death listed as gunshot .
huntng accident .
you said you were calling with whom in washington?
thank you .
run through the scenario with me .
why would someone do that?
change their name to the name of the person who died the day before?
someone the same age , from the same hometown .
why?
would it be to take over that person's life?
no , that wouldn't work .
when you die , the death cert goes both state and federal .
driver's licence , social security .
they're voided .
you couldn't do it to hide the person you are .
then why would you do it?
to hide the person you were .
say you wanted to find out a criminal record for your guy ... prior to the name change .
unless you're a professional , ..
you'd check on the name he has now ...
and the record you'd find back then would be for somebody else .
that's the significance of changing right after the person's death .
no overlap .
it gives you a whole new history .
it helps the old one disappear .
something you want to tell me?
whit , if i give you a name , could you run it for " flags "?
jesus , michael !
just this once .
check out files as a personal favor?
you don't get fired for that .
you go to jail .
whit , this is important !
my pension is important !
i'm asking you to run a name .
i'm not asking you to start surveillance and break out guns .
faraday , if you'd asked your wife to do it , she'd tell you the same .
get you classified fbl information?
i love you baby , but ...
i can't do it .
lf you want to find out about somebody , there are ways to do it .
but just not through me .
use your imagination .
hi , daphne , how are you doing?
you doing okay?
hi , hannah .
mommy and daddy aren't home .
actually , i don't need your mom and dad .
you know what?
i locked myself out of my house .
i came home and realized ...
we can't let strangers in .
i'm not a stranger .
what i need is to use your phone ... to call up ... somebody to help me get in the house .
would that be all right ...
if i use your phone?
kitchen .
good .
i'm going to use the phone in your dad's study .
you're playing here .
that's dad's study !
i'll just be a sec .

your dad won't mind .
hello?
yes , i got ... a home lockout .

i'm just back from the store .
no , thanks .

sure .
thank you , girls .
our house is your house .
michael !

today's not good .
i hear you .
i got a contract that's kicking my butt .
get back to work .
i'm sorry to drop by .
catch you back at the ranch .
good to see you .
will you just hear me out?
the guy changed his name .
why?
to help hide his background .
why?
because there's something in it !
something that's not your business .
when he was 16 , he tried to blow up some offices .
read the paper !
a government agency that was cheating his father's farm !
he served time in a juvenile program !
pipe bomb .
as a kid !
why would you go to these lengths ... to hide that part of your history?
lf it wasn't an isolated event?
lf you thought you might try again?
it says it didn't go off .
he was a kid !
brady practically killed himself with a bunch of fireworks !
what , in march?
come on !
what does that come from?
where does he get an idea like that?
what are you saying?
i'm saying ... he's going to great lengths to hide his past .
he was in st. louis when the federal building was bombed .
and there's a blueprint in his house that he does not want me to see .
are you listening to yourself?
are you listening to me?
are you listening to me?
your neighbor ... is a terrorist ... who has been blowing up buildings?
there's something going on over there !
something's being planned .
oh , something's being planned?
and in his spare time , he pays the mortgage , and takes his kid to camp an his daughters to ballet class .
that house is not normal !
that house is normal , michael !
remember when we were over there the other night?
him discussing politices with us?
and washington and leah?
do you remember this?
the guy is testing me .
you brought up leah .
he wants to see if i'm an enemy or an ally !
michael , you are the one who brought up leah .
ls that what this is about?
no , it's not about leah .
this class that you slave over ... to carry o leah's work , to have something in her memory?
these plots and conspiracies , red flags going up .
this is leah's world !
i can't ...
listen , i know .
but ... ... he's changed his name .
michael , stop it , for me .
but he was in st. louis , and the bombs ...
for me ! ... going off !
he's working on this building he doesn't want me to see .
i can't stay here tonight .
i'm not staying .
brooke !
i never did like that picture .
you know me , michael?
you think you know me?
you know me better than i know myself , don't you?
kansas city star?
i saw you .
want to tell me something i don't know?
i know what i read .
you know a 16 year old kid .
you don't know me .
you know a kid at 16 .
damn you !
you've been a guest in my house !
and you in mine , fenimore !
bill , will , william?
what do i call you?
who are you to judge me?
what gives you the right?
you ever worked on a farm?
to make a living , support your family?
government stole my father's water .
the stream that ran through our land .
they said they were appropriating it for other uses .
we couldn't grow crops or raise cattle .
we had loans we couldn't pay .
my father woke up one morning and realized he was worth more dead than alive .
his skin and bones were worth ... more in insurance money ... than as a damn farmer .
i found his tractor ... at the bottom of the bluffs .
he made it look like an accident .
i found his body .
and the note , ... he wrote it to me .
the insurance money paid off what mom could ... but it wasn't enough .
the neighbors ... the neighbors took our land at auction .
all because some bureaucrat stuck a pin in a map .
some creek in the middle of kansas .
we couldn't use our own water .
doesn't give you the right to a bomb .
16 !
you ever do anything wrong when you were 16?
you ever crash your car?
did you ever steal anything?
screw the wrong girl?
you going to tell your kid everything you did at 16?
lies you told , drugs you took .
i've been judged for this .
i got sent away for it .
best thing that could've happened .
best thing .
who is oliver?
he was my best friend growing up .
he died when we were both 25 .
i did it to honor him .
to carry on his name .
and to hide ... yeah , to hide .
because i didn't want my son knowing what i did .
i didn't want my kids to be burdened ... with people looking through old newspapers .
i'm not proud of this .
this isn't pride .
i wish it never happened .
i wish to god ... that my family could have ... my father's good name .
you have the right to know who lives next door .
who talks to your kid , who considers himself your friend .
but you also have the right ...
do you have a problem with me?
do you have issues with me?
you could have the decency to walk across the street ... and tell me to my face .
oliver !
hi , this is michael .
leave a message .
michael , it's me .
listen , i think you're right .
i saw oliver ... at the mall , in the garage , and he switched cars with somebody and i followed him ... to this warehouse delivery place , and they were unloading these long metal boxes .
i want to talk to you .
i'm coming over .
cheryl .
brooke .
i knew it was you .
hi .
hi .
what are you doing here?
just shopping .

a man was shot several times while driving on 19th street .
his out of control car struck other vehicles before slamming into a tree .
the victim was pronounced dead at the scene .
elsewhere , a single car accident near reston is tying up traffic on route 7 at this hour .
details are sketchy .
what we can tell you from our overhead shot ... is the accident took place near pine glen outlet center .
no other vehicles appear to be involved in this fatal crash .
we'll have more information when it becomes available .
the driver of the car , a woman in her mid twenties , was pronounced dead at the scene .
police say she lost control ... of her mustang and crashed through a guard rail along the ravine .
she was killed on impact .
you can't go down there , sir !
where is she?
we've got to keep this area clear .
she's been taken away .
where?
where?
hey general , how you holding up?
dad , we have to go camping !

we went swimming and climbing .
one night there was a lightning storm .
we had to stay in a motel .

me and brady can tell animal tracks .
that's terrific .

agent carver .
whit?
what did you mean , you haven't heard back from me?
the message i left on friday .
i understand now .
what message?
the one about speaking to your class .
you had asked me to speak as a guest and i thought , maybe ... with some ground rules , we could set some things straight .
wait , you called me friday?
you left a message?
yes , at the house .
when did you call?
around 4 or 5 maybe , on friday .
i didn't have any messages .
michael , if you had just found out about brooke ...
no , i didn't have any messages .
i'll call you back .
whit , listen to me .
i know you can't do anything for me .
you can't give me information , but i can give you information .
the other day , when i was talking about somebody trying ... to hide their history ,
i was talking about my neighbor .
oliver lang !
that's his name .
he used to be ...
william fenimore .
i want you to run it through your system .
are you writing this down?
michael , slow down .
he has a history .
will you run the name?

you can do that .
now , please !
i'll call you when i get back .
where are you going?
to get you proof !
run the name !
offlce hours cancelled
was it hard to find me?
you've moved several times .
your wife said , your ex wife ...
people know whose father i am .
i've been through all this before .
the government , the police ... and writers .
people wanted to believe it was political .
some conspiracy , some group .
abby and i did too .
dean was not a strong boy .
he was impressionable .
believed what friends said .
why couldn't he be involved ... with people who could set him up , talk him into even this !
the fbl , the police , found nothing .
it was him alone .
they decided this .
63 dead .
over taxes .
dean alone .
you don't believe that , do you?
i would never believe that .
have you heard the name oliver lang or william fenimore?
i've heard too many names .
your son , dean , was an electrician . maybe he was contracted for ... or he worked on a project ...
all of this was investigated !
his neighbors , customers ... kids he grew up with .
months ago !
dr. scobee , i'm sorry for bringing this all back .
it never goes away .
i had to come here , you've got to understand .
i think i know a man who knew your son .
he's 41 , a structural engineer .
he's got a wife , 3 kids .
he has this ...
what makes you so sure ... this man had anything to do with what happened here?
for the same reason you're sure ... your son didn't do it alone .
i know my son was not alone because ten children died that day !
the daycare center in the roosevelt .
he had to know it was there .
my son wouldn't have done anything to harm children .
not alone .
your son didn't have any children .
but he did things for them .
he sponsored boys from city shelters .
discoverer troops .
he coached boys 'football when he had time .
wait .
discoverer troops?
like boy scouts , but for younger children .
he was a grown up chaperone .
he'd take 'em camping .
he'd go to their meetings , teach them ...
here he is .
he must have been on some weekend adventure .
dean was best with children .
mr. faraday?
professor !
gate 40 !
grant faraday .
i'll be there in a few hours .
don't let him go anywhere !

troop?
i don't know !
he's from reston .
grant faraday .
where's my son?
faraday?
he was taken home this afternoon .
his father called .
no , wait .
i'm his father .
i called !
but you called twice , sir .
you said there had been a car accident at home .
you asked to speak with his troopmaster .
i'm his father !
that wasn't me !
here it is .
he was driven home .
by whom?
his troopmaster .
he and another boy .
what other boy?
lang , brady lang .
the troopmaster left with both of them .
you're doing it again , michael .
i told you to come to me if there's something you want to know .
where's my son?
with mine .
they're safe .
can i get you something to drink?
i saved his life !
what's that?
your son .
i saved his life !
that's why you're still here with us .
and brooke?
brooke got in the way .
we're on a schedule .
nothing personal .
what have you done with my son?
lf you want to be his father , you'll walk to your house , sleep in your bed , teach classes and live your life .
how many people are you going to kill?
lf i see any strange cars on my street , if you talk to anyone a federal agent , perhap?
then we're just gonna kill one .
he's 9 years old .
when will he be 10?
he's a good kid .
strong kid .
reminds me of a boy i grew up with .
maybe you've heard of him?
oliver lang?
they found him in the woods one day .
i'd hate for grant to see the same fate .
you sick fuck !
you're a sick fuck !
i promise you , michael ... if you stay a good neighbor , and you are , ... you'll have him back .
but if you don't calm down ,
i can't guarantee his safety .
this'll be over in a few days .
when?
you're not in danger .
when?
tell me !
michael ... please ...
because of you , my son is alive .
i would like very much to return the favor .
now , we're having a party .
you're welcome .
bye , dad .
bye .
you're a hard man to find .
whit , what are you ...?
your assistant told me you've been taking long walks between classes .
yeah .
i can't talk to you now .
no?
can you talk to me ever?
you look like shit .
what's is going on?
i'm here about oliver lang .
i've got to get my class .
how about you teach me something?
oliver lang , formely william fenimore .
we gave him a good look after the st. louis thing .
everybody who ever used a bomb got a good look .
his name change was legal .
we run the social security number through the national crime center .
not mark in his record ever since .
him and everyone he knew came up clean .
that's what you found out about?
that wichita shit when he was 16 got you thinking .
do you have something new on this guy or not?
or did you just not like him in your neighborhood?
cause you got nothing .
lf this all you got , you need to stop teaching that class cause it's getting inside your head .
you tell me you got something to go on and i'll go .
but i'm not going to walk into and other copper creek .
i got nothing , whit .
i'm sorry .

whit , that's the van !

get everyone out of the building !
there's a bomb in the van ! .
check the van .
get them out of the building !
get them out of the building !
you have to get everybody out of the building !
it's in there !
that's not the man .
grant?
let him go .
i said , let him go !
let him go .
the van is clean !
grant !
go ahead , michael , go ahead .
michael , it's all clean .
the guy is authorized to be here .
we're all authorized to be here , everyone except you !
alright?
come on .
stop michael .
come back .
michael !
stand by .
... everyone except you .
right now , we're breathless .
i just got here and there are people lying ...
at least a half dozen people here ... their faces are covered with blood , and there are crowds of people on the streets .
unbelievable !
it looks like a war zone !
half the building is blown away !
officials at this point believe , a bomb went off .
they're not sure which floor , how big .
obviously it was massive to create this kind of devastation .
officials by proxy , have no idea at this point .
they just know it is an unbelievably serious situation .
only days , but now officially ...
preliminary reports indicate the bombing was the work of this man .
michael faraday , of reston , virginia .
a professor of history at george washington university ... who instructed courses on terrorism .
officials will not confirm reports ... had anything to do with the death of mister faraday's wife ... who had been an fbl agent .
students and colleagues both say that faraday's behavior ... was increasingly erratic in the weeks leading up ...
he was really intense , knew all about these terrorists , ...
how they worked , what they wanted .
it was my favorite class .
we went to this field trip once , it was at copper creek .
he practically broke down and started crying about his wife .
we all sort of knew about it but he never really wanted to talk about it .
faraday reportedly blamed the bureau's role in his wife's death almost 3 year ago .
specifically sources speculate his target may have been agent whit carver , ... one of the 184 people to perish in the attack .
carver was the partner of faraday's wife at copper creek .
and faraday may have held him responsible .
all i know is what he told me one day after class .
i'll never forget that .
he said ,
sweetheart " one day those men are going to pay , ... one day , those men are going to burn
yet , all of them described faraday as a solitary , but friendly ... as a talent professor fascinated by the american underground .
and as a loving father to his 10 year old son , who is now in the care of relatives .
after exhausting hundreds of thousands of man hours , at least ... federal investigators are finally ready to say ... that just as in the st. louis lrs bombing nearly 12 years ago , ... this spring's attacks on the fbl , the worst terrorist strike in our nation's history ... was the work of one man and one man , alone .
any news yet?
no .
they'll let us know .
someplace nice .
i hope .
someplace safe .
always .
