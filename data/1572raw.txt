how's the script going?
the suicide part is difficult
the lovers 'suicidejourneywill be through a graveyard
you found a location?
in a ravine near mt .
toribe in kyoto
it's full ofstrange headstones
i think it's stale
but it captures the space on stage , the nothingness
there's something there
a sort offetishism ofspace
thevivid contrast between that and the bodies ofthe couple
can i see the photos? .
a suicide sequence in kabuki style won't do
you have to pull them in
it should be realistic
it shouldn't be as beautiful as death is in kabuki
you don't have to follow the script forthat scene
thewords could be random
the essential image needs to be captured
let's talk about it later .
no , i'll seeyou tomorrow
i'll bewaiting .
goodbye

double sulcide
avow a month ...
the 29th time
though i vowed that i'd redeemyou
the 30thwill come nextyear
nextyear? .
it's already december
how longwill i have towait? .
well ...
i don't know
areyou going to desert me? .
you despise me because i can't redeem you
how could you say that when i loveyou so? . jihei
as a courtesan , i must entertain customers
how i hate myself ! .
you may think my promises to be a courtesan's silly talk
no , koharu
did i ever doubtyour love? .
even as i seeyou
i worry about money to seeyou again
i want to takeyou as soon as possible , but
i still can't redeem thewoman i love
i fearyou won't love me any more
the bodywas boughtwith money
i've never hated it as much as i do now
i'm bound by money from head to toe
who thought ofselling women as courtesans? .
i wish i could raise the money .
but i can't live withoutyou
neither can i.
what shall we do? .
we can't run away together
i want to stay with you like this forever
so do i.
but why doyou love me? .
becauseyou're a woman and i'm a man
i'm glad you're a woman
but a courtesan must not fall in love
you regret it? .
i want to die .
can i diewith you? .
can i? .
jihei , what can we do? .
meeting is joy and pain .
my koharu !
good evening
koharu , we've been waiting foryou
i'm so glad you agreed to come
as the weather changes every day
my mood often changes
my customers always shout , " bring koharu !
don't mention my name so loudly
he's outside ...
the man i hate
koharu !
it's nice to seeyou
you stopped seeing me , so i missed you
you flatter me
hasjihei redeemed you? .
you're kind and pretty enough for me , tahei
why bewith a poor man likejihei? .
soyou're spreading the false rumor
false? .
you know it's true
i don'twant to hear it
then doyou want to hear the sound of gold? .
you fell in love with thewrong man
there are many men in osaka .
whyjiehi? .
he married his cousin , and has two children
the paper business is slow and he's always poor
how can he raise ten kan ofsilverforyou? .
he's asking too much
that's none ofyour concern
on the contrary , i have no family or relatives
maybe jihei uses sweeterwords but , unlike me , he has very little money
is she going to meet jihei tonight? .
i'll pay twice as much as he pays for her
there's nothing in theworld money can't buy
let's have some drinks first
her customertonight is a samurai
please go somewhere else tonight , mr. tahei
who's afraid ofa samurai? .
he may have swords but not many , only two .
who's afraid? .
i'll buy the samurai togetherwith koharu !
i'm lucky to have met koharu here tonight
maybe the priest i met has brought this luck
i thank him
let's chant a sutra jihei , the paper dealer
his clothes are made ofpaper
his shop can't stand like paper
he's no better than waste paper
oh , merciful buddha !
speaking ofwaste , it's him
what a costume !
a hat at night? .
waste paper , why the costume? .
koharu
i have no swords , but i'm armed with money
it's stronger than swords ... and much stronger than jihei's waste paper
how dare he !
it's stupid .
let's go to a better place
ifwe seejihei , let's kick him
no one knows thevalue ofmoney around here
in thisworld , money is everything
remember it .
let's go
i'm sorry , samurai .
they offended you
wait , samurai .
excuse me
i'm glad you're not jihei in disguise
i had to make sure
then , koharu , have a good timewith him
please take care ofher
you're still open in this cold? .
i can't live if i stop vending
that's true
what is it today? .
i just passed through the red light district
i heard a rich man is going to redeem koharu
you alreadywent there? .
i mean i went there on business
koharu , the courtesan? .
koharu ofthe kinokuniya
i'd like to be a woman in my next life
fool
koharu , you've lost weight
deep insideyou love me
i'd like to elopewith you
wherewould we go to die? .
umeda? .
kitano? .
you examine me as if i were an animal
i didn't come here to be insulted
it's not easy to go out
it's not easy to leave the palace ,
but since i heard so much aboutyou
i came here alone and asked the mistress to call you
forwhat? .
for a woman who looks so sad without a smile? .
i didn't come here to nurse a sick girl
you're right , sir , but there's a reason
listen to me
koharu is in lovewith a man named jihei
it's alwaysjihei
she accepts no one else
but she's a courtesan
she has no right to choose
much less to love
it's bad for business
it's the master's duty to stop her
so he chose good customers ...
likeyou , sir , for her
you may not like it , but forgive her
now , koharu , be bright and entertain him
which is more painful , hangingyourself or cuttingyourthroat? .
what areyou saying? .
you frighten me
it's too much
you shouldn't say that to a new customer
let's have sake and cheer up
judging from your attitude you want to diewith jihei your love
but take my advice
ifyou diewith him his familywill hateyou
ifyou have parents , they'll be sad
you can't go to heaven nor hell easily
can'twe even go to hell? .
although you're a strangerto me
i can't justwatch you die
ifmoney can settle it , i'll help you
you'd bettertell me the truth
you're right .
we promised to die together
because i'm deep in debt to the master
redeeming me costs a fortune jihei told me he'd redeem me
and threeyears have passed
i don't want anyone else to redeem me
but i'm not free
i have no right to choose my redeemer
what if a stranger tries to redeem me? .
we have no otherway than to die together
will it be today or tomorrow? .
but , thinking of my mother
i'm her only child
she's poor , living in a slum
if i die , she'll starve
i don't knowwhat to do
you said you'd help me .
did you mean it? .
samurai don't lie
you may laugh at me
but , honestly ...
i don'twant to die
i'm afraid
please be my customerfrom now on until next spring so he can't come and tell me when to die
ifhe gives me up he'll live and sowill i
koharu
that's human nature
i understand
let's get some fresh air
come over here
i failed !
driven by jealousy , he draws his sword
he's drunk .
forgive him !
no .
leave him to me
what happened? .
here's a ruffian with a sword
he should be tied up like this
please forgive him !
now , let's go to bed , koharu
awild one .
it serves him right
leave it to me .
gowith him
well , ifit isn'tjihei !
i didn't seeyou around .
you're here
i didn't knowyou were tied here
you stole something? .
areyou that poor? . jihei , what did you steal? .
you thief !
robber !
here'sjihei , who stole and was caught
the thiefis tied up here jihei , the love sickthief !
why shout? .
thief? .
tell mewhatjihei stole
how dareyou lie like that? . jihei , stamp on him in punishment
not one ofyou raised a fingerto help me !
i'll remember each ofyourfaces !
you'll be sorry
everyone laughs
'catch him !
beat him ! '
'he's going thatway
'throw him in
'don't let him go !! '
jihei
it'syou , brother magoemon !
your brother? .
what have i done !
i'm ashamed ofmyself
how could you cheat on me?? ! .
i should stamp on you beforetahei !
i hateyou !
i heard all your dishonest appeals jihei , stop your nonsense
cheating is a whore's job
fool !
you couldn't see through her
i did , as soon as i met hertoday
i'm ashamed
i let herfool me so easily !
how miserable !
you're almost thirty , not a child
you have a shop to run
you have two children to raise
yetyou're in lovewith a courtesan .
and nowyou're ashamed? .
then you didn't mean whatyou said? .
listen !
osan , yourwife , is our cousin
her mother is our aunt
herfather is old and stubborn
he saysyou fooled osan
he'll take her back and shameyou
he's furious
her mother isworried
osan is sickfrom trying to protectyou
how can i make it up to her? .
so she asked the master here to let me meetwith koharu and find outwhat she's thinking
look at me
as if i were in a parade
because of my stupid brother , a decent merchant like me became a two bit actor playing an incognito official
this iswhat i wore my first sword for
it's stupid of me even to be angry
too ridiculous to cry
i'm sorry , brother
how i hate myself !
i've been taken in by this wench foryears
i left my family for her
i even left my shop unattended
brother , i realize i was wrong
i'll be through with her
i'll break the promises , twenty nine in all
i'll return them to her !
take them !
i was a fool keeping them close to me
brother , get my twenty nine promises from her
and burn them !
give them to me !
yes , i will
one , two , three ...
twenty nine ofthem
awoman's letter .
what is this? .
it's important to me .
give it back
it's a letterfrom osan to koharu
koharu , i'll keep this
i'll keep it for myself
i'll burn it later
forget a samurai's promise
this is a merchant's .
trust it .
understand? .
thankyou
awoman's obligation will be carried out
who's talking about obligations? . jihei ...
i don'twant to see her
she's fooled me for threeyears
i'll step on her
i'd been in love for so long
even ifshe's a prostitute she cheated me badly
this is my goodbye
stop it, jihei
koharu !
near a shrine oftenjin god
many trodded thetenjin bridge
the streetwas busy and bustling
therewas a paper shop run by a man
named jihei and hiswife osan
hewas honest by nature
and his shop was reputable
osan
it's cold today
otama is late .
what's she doing? .
i sent her on a simple errand , and this !
it's suppertime

the fool almost made me forget .
yes? .
i sawyour mother coming here with magoemon , the flour dealer
my mother and magoemon? .
why? .
they'll be here soon
i must wake jihei

let's go in
osan , even ifyou'reyoung you're a mother oftwo
you should bewise
it'syourfault that your man stays out
he might go bankrupt
ifyou get a divorce , it'll beyour shame
osan

aunt , he even tried to fool his brother
he won't listen to her jihei
how dareyou fool me !

stop pretending to be busy !
you want to borrow money for koharu? .
give it to me
you'rewrong , brother
you know , i went out only twice to the wholesale store and the shrine
redeem her? .
what areyou talking about? .
i didn't even think ofher .
why? .
don't give me that .
don't act innocent
we had a meeting last night
we heard koharu , the courtesan would be redeemed by a rich merchant
the merchant loves her
he says he'll redeem her any day now
they say some rich men are really stupid
like the merchant
but ...
listen to me
gozaemon , my husband is very strict , asyou know
he heard the rumor and thought the merchantwasyou
you're my nephew , not his
he loves osan
he said you'd sell her off to redeem koharu
hewas furious
hewanted to get her before her clothes disappeared
he started to come
i stopped him , saying , " check the rumors
beforeyou blamejihei
and i sent for magoemon to come here
according to magoemon
jihei isn't the man he used to be
he's become a good merchant
he's through with the courtesan
i didn't understand
i came here and found out
you're a lazyworm !
but ... jihei .
yourfatherwas my brother
heworried aboutyou until he died
before he breathed his last breath he told me : .
take care ofyour nephew and son in law
i can't forget it
i can't even keep my promise to him
i understand
the man redeeming koharu isn't me
brother
remembertahei? .
you let me step on his face
hewanted to redeem koharu but i stopped him
now that i'm through with her it's his chance to redeem her
aunt
we're through .
why should i redeem her? .
don't believe the false rumor
mother .
i may be good natured
but i wouldn't help him ifhewanted to redeem her
he's tellingyou the truth this time
i'll stand witness
you can't believe rumors
father is too hasty
since osan says so , it must be true
theywouldn't take in a courtesan
would they? .
mother is hasty , too .
isn't she? .
all right
butyour fatherwon't be convinced so easily
let's make sure .
give me a written promise
yes , as many as you wish , aunt ... since i'm to blame for all this
i'm sorry i madeyou worry
mother , brother in law , thankyou
it's settled .
i'm so happy .
how can i thankyou? .
itwas my fault , too
he'll work hard from tomorrow on
osan is right
you can do anything ifyou try hard
i'vewritten it , aunt
nowyour shop will prosper , won't it? .
we're all worried about yourfamily
becausewe loveyou all
becausewe're relatives
it's settled .
let's go , magoemon
i'll set my husband's mind at ease
hurry , magoemon
osan , thewind is cold
don't let the kids get sick .
take care , osan
our ancestorswill help you .
namu amidabutsu
take care , mother
did sangoro close the backdoors? .
yes , he did
we must pay our bills tomorrow .
time flies !
i must make a kimono for kantaro
i'm glad you gave up on koharu
itwas hard to run the shop
i'm so glad
from tomorrow on , you'll run this place
awoman just can't do business like a man
i needn't be jealous anymore
what is it? .
areyou crying? .
why? .
oh , no !
can'tyou give her up after all? .
you miss her so much? .
why then did you promise? .
remember? .
it was in october twoyears ago
the last time we slept together i don't know whyyou hate me butyou stopped making love to me
today , at last you promised to give koharu up
i thoughtwe could live like a couple
butyou still love her
it's cruel ofyou
ifyou miss her so much , cry hard
letyourtears fall into the river
koharu will drink it
we have two children , but still no love? .
can'tyou give her up? .
what have i done to deserve this? .
pity the children
finallywe're together again
i don't know anything anymore !
osan , you have the right to blame me
listen
tears ofsadness and tears of joy flow the sameway
they flow from the eyes
iftears ofregret flowed from the ears you'd know the pain of my heart
a man shouldn't cry for koharu
listen to me
she's a four legged animal , not a human
why should i miss her? .
she lied to me
she said she'd never let tahei redeem her
ifher master insisted she'd kill herself
she always said so
yet ten days afterwe parted she's alreadyyielded totahei .
that tramp !
whywould i miss a courtesan like that? .
osan
why should i cry for her? .
then koharu ...
tahei spread theword : jihei can't even redeem a courtesan
he said i was about to go bankrupt
wholesale clerks stare at me suspiciously
i live in shame
osan
i hate it !
i hate it !
i can't tolerate it !
jihei , what'll i do? .
that'swhyyou're crying
then koharu may die
terrible !
she'll die
what'll i do? .
she'll die? .
osan
you'rewise , butyou don't know theworld
you don't know what a courtesan does
it's herworkto fool men using hertricks
shewon't die
you'rewrong
you'rewrong this time
i never meant to tell you this
but i can't let her die for me
she didn'twant to leaveyou
but she acted as if shewere foolingyou
what areyou saying? .
what did you do? .
you went to the pleasure quarters every night
you neglected yourwork i didn't mind that butyou were desperate i thoughtyou'd diewith her
asyourwife , i can't watchyou die
it made me so sad i couldn't bear it
i wrote to koharu asking , " please save my husband's life
you may think i shouldn't have done that
but i'm yourwife
koharu is a courtesan , but she's a woman too
even ifyou oppose it , she'll kill herself
even ifyou don't love me
i will do anything foryou
so koharu ...
she accepted my request
she answered she'd giveyou up
but it's not easy
i asked herto saveyou , and she agreed because she lovesyou
i have her letter close to me .
look
she's decent , with a strong sense of duty
she wouldn't break her promise toyou
least ofall , to lettahei redeem her
awoman in love is strong
shewon'tyield easily
you see? .
she acted out ofregard for me
you don't understand
you only talkabout love
what a man !
at this rate , she'll die
how can i let her die? .
we must save her life .
save her !
i rememberthe letter .
brother read
you wrote it? .
i see
koharu may die , then
out of my honor , i cannot let her die
we must try to stop her .
go to her
but what can i do? .
i must pay her master a pile of money so he'll stop her from being redeemed
i need 1 50 pieces of gold to keep her alive
i haven't got that much
we can't save herwithout money
what'll i do? .
what can i do? .
it's no time for questions .
we must raise it
money? .
eighty pieces of gold !
how did you get it? .
i didn't know
i'll explain later koharu's life can'twait
itwas to pay for paper .
it's honest money
i'll make up for it later with magoemon
we need seventy pieces more .
what'll i do? .
osan !
you can get seventy from the pawnshop
pawn my kimonos .
i don't need them
you need yours to keep up a front
get the money and redeem her
beat the hateful tahei with the money
but , osan ...
what if i redeem her? .
what will i do with her then? .
keep her somewhere? .
here? .
what aboutyou , osan? .
i didn't think about that i was so worried about her
what'll i do? .
make her a nurse? .
or a cook? .
i should be punished
byyou , ifnot by heaven
forgive me , osan .
forgive me
i'm a hopelessly selfish fool
i madeyou raise the money for my courtesan
please forgive me , osan
a husband shouldn't ask that
it's a wife's duty .
i'll sell my hair ifmy clothes aren't enough
i paid for paper with my clothes too
my closet is already empty
but i've never regretted it
it's too late ifshe dies
go quick
sangoro
take this bundle and accompanyyour master
isjihei in? .
father !
why? .
sit down jihei , my son in law
you're dressed up
wearing a sword , you look like a rich man
going to the brothel? .
every night? .
you need nowife
osan , he doesn't need you
you mustn't go out in the cold
i'll get tea foryou
you must have heard from mother
she lectured my man today
he promised he'd give up the courtesan
didn'tyou see the letter? .
you mean this? .
the worse men are , the more they promise !
look at him
as i thought , he's a liar
he even swore to the gods
they must be amazed byyour selfishness just write her a letter of divorce instead
you have every reason to blame me
but i have no time to explain
have mercy on me
don't take her away from me
even if i become a beggar even if i starve
i'll never make her suffer
she won't have a hard time
because
i can never return all i owe osan
i can't tell you why
please be lenient and let her stay
let me live with her
there's a reason .
be quiet !
you're free to become a beggar or to starve
but osan will never be a beggar's wife
write her a letter of divorce
i'll count her kimono and seal them first
i'll check
no !
there's no need to do that
you don't have to do that
well !
it's empty !
no clothes at all !
all the clothes she brought are gone jihei , what'syour excuse forthis? .
what does it mean? .
what's that? .

formal wear !
so many clothes !
even the boy's coat !
wereyou going to pawn everything? .
well done !
you've stripped your family
all foryour courtesan !
i'm amazed
all you can do is make love? .
what a fool !
you can't fool me .
you're nothing to me
osan , you're a fool , too
you let him fool you
write a letter of divorce !
i won't write it with a brush
no !
don't be hasty !
i'll explain to father
he'll understand
he may be nothing toyou , but his children are your grandchildren
even ifhe agrees to a divorce i won't !
be quiet !
ifyou refuse towrite it
i won't need it !
i'll take osan home with orwithout it !

areyou afraid of death now? .
when we're together like this? .
no !
areyou afraid? .
let's not complain anymore
i've had all kinds ofhardship
but i bore them all foryou
yourwife's letter pained me the most
forget it
she didn't ask me to return you
she asked me to saveyou
even if i'm a courtesan , even if i loveyou so much ...
forget it .
we're going to die
i wanted nothing but to bewith you
i shouldn't fall in love
acourtesan must sleep with hundreds ofmen
i believed itwas mywork
i didn'twish to be a courtesan
i'm a woman like any other
why can't i fall in love , like any other? .
but there's nothing i can do
you're osan's precious husband
why is it thatyou're going to diewith me? .
why? .
out of duty toyou
my duty is to osan .
we'rewomen butwe even forgot to be jealous
duty binds us all , notwomen alone
i don'twant to die
why , when i loveyou? .
i don'twant to die , either
wewant to be together
hurry , or down will break
kill me here .
kill yourself elsewhere
haveyou forgotten? .
won'twe die together? .
but i couldn't face yourwife then
i'd break my promise to saveyour life
she'd think it a courtesan's lie
others may think so but osan mustn't .
i'd be sad
osan , towhom you feel duty bound was taken away by herfather .
we're divorced
you owe her nothing
even ifyou divorced her ...
you're my wife now
no one will laugh
i want to diewith you
but i'm to blame for osan leavingyou
i caused herto suffer
i caused all this
say no more
even when we die a woman only complains
you do , too
we may die apart and birds will feed on us but our soulswill be together
sowhat does it matter howwe die? .
take me to hell orwherever it is !
what haveyou done? .
with this hair , i'd be called osan's husband
but now i'm a priest
i have no home
nor have i a family
you're not dutybound to anyone now
i'm a nun now , i owe no one anything
that's the daichotemple gong
we don't belong to the mundaneworld now
we don't have to die together
with the bridge between us me here , you there
dutybound even after you've become a nun? .
i won't be a courtesan in the next life
you worry aboutyour children? .
don't make me remember and cry
they don't know their bad father is dying
i'm a sinful woman .
forgive me, jihei
it's the only thing that depresses me
jihei , hurry and kill me !
no one shall see yourtearful face
koharu .
smile .
smile for me
no !
no !
i'm afraid !
the end
