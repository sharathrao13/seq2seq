welcome , people of nong pradu .
welcome , all who came for the presentation of robes to our revered ong bak , which is our mind and soul .
this ceremony is a prelude to the great festival of ong bak that will commence here in seven days .
and it will be an important ceremony , which is held just once every 24 years .
it marks the auspicious completion of two cycles .
prosperity will be in our community .
where's the buddha amulet?
it shows signs of wear .
the head's slightly chipped .
hardly perfect condition .
200, 000 baht is a good price .
why won't you sell it?
come on .
name your price .
don , it's not for sale .
i've come all the way from bangkok .
i took time off work .
i never told you i'd sell it .
i'm keeping it for my son , humlae , for when he is ordained as a monk for ong bak .
when you decide to sell , call me .
no .
no way .
i don't have a telephone .
i'll give you my address .
when you decide to sell , write me a letter .
isn't it nice , grandma?
i want to give it to ting when he's ordained .
nice .
he was born during the ong bak festival , wasn't he?
well , if you say so .
ting had an unfortunate start in life .
he was left at a temple when he was a baby .
a monk happened to see him .
he took pity on him and looked after him .
perhaps he is fortunate and he is protected by ong bak .

i have taught you the art of muay thai , and passed on the knowledge .
now i ask you never to use it .
is that clear , ting?
yes , master .
good .
it's good that you didn't understand .
am i right?
in his youth , your master learned the ancient art of muay thai under the great master kru dam .
the master , he was impatient to try out his skills .
in a rope fist fight , he killed his opponent .
overcome with guilt , he decided to become a monk .
muay thai is dangerous .
he doesn't want you fooling around with it .
is it clear now?
if you're still not convinced ...
come .
fight with me , ting .
uncle !
you vandals !
what are you doing?
move it !
that scumbag don severed the head of ong bak !
he also stole the poor box , master .
don is such a devil !
wicked man .
if we can't recover ong bak's head , our village is doomed !
everybody , calm down .
we'll find a way to bring the buddha's head back before the great ceremony .
but who will bring it back?
i'll bring it back !
i know where don lives .
the fate of the whole village lies in your hands .
this sacred amulet contains nilapat herbs .
my grandfather told me it belonged to kru dam .
keep it close to your heart .
here's don's address .
and please give this letter to humlae .
ting , be sure to bring ong bak back ... safely home to our village .
here's some money for food .
all our hopes go with you .
mother gave me this ring before she died .
warn , take care of grandmother .
everybody , give what you can .
for the journey .
bangkok
shit , i lost !
bugger off !
come here !
who'd you pick to race?
we lost by miles !
what the hell you are talking about?
win some , lose some !
you're the big boss you should be fair .
you put up a girl against me?
so i'm a girl .
so what?
do you know who you're talking to?
shame you don't race as fast as you talk !
screw you !
hey , why aren't you giving me cash?
you used speed to bet with .
but you said cash was fine .
ok !
here's 10, 000 baht .
the rest's security on your debts .
i pay you interest every month and it's not due yet .
give me some spending money .
take it or leave it .
i guess it's better than nothing .
hey , give me those .
fuck's sake !
give them to me .
you got cash .
you can leave me two tabs for my boys .
you guys can score what you need anytime , anywhere .
why do you want to take mine?
it's too strong for these pussies .
they might od .
trust me .
give me .
no !
shithead !
there you are at last , george .
quick !
where's my share?
quick !
i'm in a hurry .
that asshole peng got wise to our scam .
he kept all the money .
what?
if this is a joke , it's not funny !
look !
check out my face !
you think i did that to myself , for christ's sake?
hands off !
i just got beaten up !
your bad luck .
how could he tell?
sod it .
have you got 200 baht?
hold on !
i haven't got my fair share .
pay up first , borrow later !
muay , you always take your share of the dough , every penny , but never your share of the beatings .
serves you right , you fool !
obvious , isn't it?
i messed up , smarty pants?
peng has given me three days to pay up or he'll come after me .
humlae !
it is you , isn't it?
greetings !
muay , is he a friend of yours?
what do you mean?
he's talking to you .
you know this hillbilly?
don't you remember me?
ting from nong pradu .
yeah , right !
i don't know you .
i don't know you .
got that , sucker?
i remember you .
you're humlae .
what kind of a name is that?
dumbest name i've ever heard .
clear out , before i kick your ass !
go easy , humlae ...
sorry , george , i mean .
you think you know everything?
go away as far as you can !
what was the name of your village?
nong pradu .
right , nong pradu .
i'll go .
i'll leave the nong pradu boys to it .
right?
he shows up and you take off !
go !
but leave me some dough .
buy yourself some medicine .
see ya , humlae .
as for you , country boy , go back where you came from !
humlae , your dad gave me a letter for you .
i don't know you .
scram !
this is my room .
take no notice about earlier .
close the door , or it'll be swarming with mosquitoes .
i was out of line .
i was in a bad mood .
humlae , our village is in big trouble .
don and his men stole ong bak's head .
our headman told me to come and find you so we could get it back .
i have don's address here .
save it for later .
here , dump your gear and go take a shower .
go on .
come on , quick !
it'll do you good .
through here .
then can we ...?
later .
here's a towel .
i'll even turn on the light for you .
go .
soap's on the left , toothpaste on the right .
don't wank , ok?
i don't want you to slip and die .
hi , is that you , muay?
meet me at the khaosan road .
yes , the fight club .
still time to place a bet on ali?
yes .
all of it .
where's the amulet?
their pigheaded chief refused to sell .
so i took ong bak's head instead , boss .
he's the village deity , boss .
they revere him .
you wasted your time .
it's a lousy lump of stone .
you're such a jerk !
get this rock out of my sight ... before i really get mad !
your boys keep letting you down , huh?
and now pearl harbour's going to get the kamikaze treatment from my boy ali .
haven't got any money yet .
i'm trying to get it for you .
i don't want your money .
i can find it myself .
are you pushing drugs these days?
yes !
you seem very sure of that .
if you think your guy can win , up the stakes !
whatever .
i have no limit .
don't argue .
you never understand me !
you asshole !
why do you have to act like this?
muay , you're not my mother !
it's because you've got no parents that you're such a loose cannon !
yes , i'm bad but i've looked after you .
from now on , stay away from me .
just ask whenever you want .
next fight , if you're still game ... maybe you'd like to up the stakes .
