not everybody's blessed with brains and talent .
so how comeyou didn't sit next to hector like he asked you to? .
'cause i didn't feel like it .
he thinks you're a good fighter .
hector got me started .

she's sweet on me , but it's like i don't have time to
be a romeo? .
yeah .
halfthe time ...
i get a feeling that she only likes me 'cause i wanna go pro .
you being exploited? .
i'm serious .
she's gorgeous and all that , but it's like ... sometimes we don't have much to say to each other , you know? .
sounds like a dream date for most guys .

you must be the new boxer .
i'm candice .
not bad for an old fart .
how areyou doing? .
happy birthday .
thankyou .
i was just talking aboutyou .
i've come to defend myself .
hey , rememberwhen i told you that girls can't be boxers? .
yeah , i remember .
girls excuse me
women have a lower center of gravity .
maybe they're more grounded once they build strength .
it makes 'em a different kind ofboxer .
are you serious? .
it's just a theory .
the way to prove it is to get more women in that ring .
one twenty six .
must be all that muscle you're building .
what division? .
you're a featherweight .
you're not mingling .
huh? .
this is a party .
you should be dancin '.
i'm not much of a dancer .
sureyou are .
i mean , you dance , right? .
hector says my footwork gets sloppy .
looks okay to me .
let's box .
come on .
no , bro , not in hector's kitchen .
but you're all serious and shit .
come on .
be a man .
you know ... they say love kills you in the ring .
hector , i gotta go .
butyou just got here .
sureyou can't stay longer? .
no .
it was betterwith the ice cream .
howyou feel? .
tired .
this is a waste oftime .
look , adrian's got a bout coming up .
i don't mean to insultyou
what's the big deal? .
there's no one near adrian's weight to sparwith today .
might as well give my gal a chance .
i don't like it , hector .
tell him to think ofher as a warm up .
this equality crap has gone too far .
should we just forget about it? .
no .
just get rough on her in the first round and hectorwill stop it real early .
go ahead .
come on .
what'd i tell you? .
hit me !
hit me already .
i'm not gonna fight him ifhe doesn't hit me .
both ofyou , enough bullshit !
now box !
you okay? .
stay inside .
i loveyou .
i really do .
come on .
i'm not running afteryou , ifthat's whatyou want .
a gender blindamateur boxing proposal ... is a statewide initiative that responds to the ongoing demands ... for officially sanctioned amateur matches ... while also addressing the expanding presence offemales in the sport .
male and female amateurs within the same weight class ... are allowed to compete with each other in the ring .
now that they're m ixi ng up the guys with the girls ... you could have a lot more opponents .
they got you fighting this girl from buffalo next week .
and you can have a fight everyweek ifyou want .
hey , vince .
long time no see .
let me get this straight .
she's had three amateur matches and she's already turning pro? .
that's a little premature , don'tyou think? .
damn it !
trainer says kid's got a high fever .
dead on his feet with strep throat .
i'd fight thatyellow kid with one arm .
missy from buffalo's 33 years old and she can make some money as a pro .
the fight's totally called off? .
why botherwith small fry stuff when she can be on tv? .
calm down .
there'll be other matches .
not soon enough .
it's a pathetic turnout , but i've gotta give these people their $1 0 worth .
and half of my fighters haven't showed up .
come on , ira .
let's just see this thing in action .
all right .
ifit turns ugly , you can't say i didn't warn you .
nervous? .
no .
all right .
remember , you're judged on points .
be aggressive and make legal punches .
nervous? .
no .

how does it feel to see so much ofyourself so close? .
how does it feel? .
diana , stop !
please , diana , stop .
just stop .
all theseyears , you just looked right through me .
lookwhat the cat dragged in .
who are they? .
those are hector's kids .
he doesn't see them too often .
never mind .
who was that? .
nobody .
quit it .
oh , please .
no , i'm serious .
this athletic shit makes you , like , a class achiever .
you think so? .
yeah .
well , now that i got school all covered ...
i only have the world outside ofthese walls to fuck up .
damn , girl , that's grim .
it's the truth .
holy shit .
what? .
ex hundred percent man is toyour left .
stop being so obvious .
damn , girl .
that's him with the forearms? .
yeah .
well , ifhe's such an ex , what's he doing here? .
i don't know .
maybe he's a glutton for punishment or something .
a glutton for punishment , loca?
yeah .
shit , you better go over there .
i heard you fought ray .
you're right .
he's a fucking case .
i feel pretty fucking stupid out here , waiting for school to be let out .
then don't .
right .
so , where's yourwoman when she doesn't have her tongue in your ear? .
or doyou only bring her out for special occasions? .
i came here to say i'm sorry .
sorry forwhat , adrian? .
proving toyour friends you can still snag the pretty girl? .
you gotyourself a fuckin 'trophy now .
bet it makes you feel real big inside , huh? .
i don't feel too big right now .
as a matter offact , i feel pretty fucking small around you .
must be nice .
yeah , well , it's not .
you and me , we just met each other , right? .
we barely know each other .
no problem .
so , then leave .
maybe i don't wanna leave .
why? .
you're offthe hook now , free to do whatever .
that's not all i wanted to say .
i told karina it wasn't gonna work out with her .
i told her i finally met somebody that ... makes something happen for me .
just 'cause it's true doesn't mean i know what to do about it , okay? .
you got anything to say to that? .
so i'm someone , huh? .
yeah , you are .
i was wrong .
there's more than one ofyou out there .
and i hear she's good .
she's a southpaw , and she's won most ofher matches 'cause ofit .
these next couple ofweeks i'm gonna trainyou so hard ... you'll be wired like a machine .
there's all kinds offighters out there .
the more versatile you are , the better preparedyou are .
you gotta learn how to manage your power , 'cause you got more ofit ... than people realize .
howyou gonna do that?
first , you're gonna strengthen yourjab .
feels funny , ri ght? .
southpaw now .
okay? .
i 'm ricky .
i 'm ricky .
come on .
good .
j ab , jab .
very nice .
very clever .
girls , i want a good , clean fight .
it's my decision if one ofyou needs a standing eight count .
ifyou score a knockdown , go to the farthest neutral corner ... and stay there .
don't come out until i tell you to resume fighting .
got it? .
let's go .
the key to this is not losing your cool .
the judges are gonna give that to stiles 'cause they see her hands moving .
remind them you're in there with her .
that was nice .
okay , your punches are making contact .
your defense is strong .
butyou gotta stagger her .
these judges won't giveyou any points ifthey can't seeyou slowing her down .
stop .
ladies andgentlemen , we have a split decision .
hilljudges 29 27 for guzman .
ferrarajudges 29 27 for stiles .
andersonjudges 28 27 for guzman .
and the bout goes to guzman .
based on the results ofthe preliminary matches ... you've been advanced to the fi nals .
even though the first fight was stopped? .
yep .
you scored better than a lot of the kids in your division .
that's great .
so , uh , who's next? .
come on , cal .
you saw herwith stiles .
what's going on here? .
i'll tell you what .
this rinky dink operation excuse my candor , ira
iet this goddamn gender blind program get out ofhand .
you signed him up for it .
boys are different from girls .
what's so wrong about saying it out loud? .
boys are different from girls .
no girl has what it takes to be a boxer .
neither do most boys .
i'm gonna petition the fight .
oh , come on , you're the one always complaining ... you can't get enough matches foryour guys .
adrian's young .
he works hard .
he's a good looking kid .
ayear from now i want him grooming for the pros .
then you're pushing him .
you can't humiliate my guy like this !
ira , i need your support .
fileyour protest , but don't ask me to get involved .
i will saythis .
let the boxers box , and that'll speak for itself .
unbelievable .
hector , ifthis happens ...
i'm telling adrian no mercy .
you understand? .
yeah .
so will she .
this is crazy .
and cal's right .
this fucks with my record .
it's your amateur record .
we know each other's habits .
fuck !
come on .
stiles makes fights , right? .
you said ityourself .
you have lostyour mind .
i got it .
i won't make myweight .
what? .
i'll eat for a fucking change .
i won't fightyou , and that's it .
who says you're the only one fighting? .
i'm sorry , diana .
i haven't trained all this time to be stuck in a ring with a girl .
stuckwith a girl .
okay .
stuckwith you .
you're afraid i mightwin .
no .
you're gonna play it all manly and protective on me now .
look , i'm just being honest .
you're just like any other guy .
oh , yeah? .
what kind ofa guy goes around beating up a girl that
that he what? .
what? .
just forget it .
it's not right .
fine .
all i know ... is ifyou don't fight me in this match ... you're less ofa man than you thinkyou are .
what is it that you want from me anyway? .
you want me to takeyou a little more seriously , huh? .
is that whatyou want? .
is thatyour idea of prince charming? .
you need to takeyourself a little more seriously .
who's the one who said it was all about the challenge? .
who's the one who said that they love to win? .
well , i'm not gonna love winning this one .
then maybeyou shouldn't be a boxer .
oh , saycanyousee
bythe dawn's earlylight

at the twilight's last gleaming
whose broadstripes and bright stars
through the perilous fight
o'er the ramparts we watched
were so gallantly streaming
and the rockets 'red glare
the bombs bursting in air

this seat is saved for someone .
that our flag was still there
you know what? .

and the home
ofthe brave
how you feeling? .
like i got nothing to lose .
good , then .
inside , you know him? .
yeah .
how's he fight? .
he's always stepping left .
he relies on his right for power .
he jabs low , and his right cross can knock me out .
