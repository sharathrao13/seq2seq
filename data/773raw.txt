is this on?
that's fine .
i can break through walls , i just can't ...
that's fine .
i can't get this on .
mr. incredible ...
do you have a secret identity?
every superhero has a secret identity .
i don't know a single one who doesn't .
who wants the pressure of being super all the time?
of course i have a secret identity .
can you see me in this at the supermarket?
come on .
who'd want to go shopping as elastigirl , know what i mean?
superladies , they're always trying to tell you their secret identity .
think it'll strengthen the relationship or something .
i said , " girl , i don't want to know about your mild mannered alter ego .
i mean , you tell me you're a super mega ultra lightning babe , that's all right with me .
i'm good .
i'm good .
no matter how many times you save the world , it always manages to get back in jeopardy again .
sometimes i just want it to stay saved , you know?
for a little bit .
i feel like the maid .
i just cleaned up this mess .
can we keep it clean for ten minutes?
i could get to that point .
" please?
we're not finished .
sometimes i think i'd just like the simple life , you know?
relax a little and raise a family .
settle down?
are you kidding?
i'm at the top of my game ! .
i'm up there with the big dogs ! .
girls , come on .
leave the saving of the world to the men?
i don't think so .
i don't think so .
we interrupt for a bulletin .
a high speed pursuit between police and armed gunmen is underway , traveling northbound on san pablo ave .
y eah , i've got time .
mr. incredible .
what is it , ma'am?
my cat , squeaker , won't come down .
certainly .
i suggest you stand clear .
there could be trouble .
no , he's quite tame .
let go now .
thank you , mr. incredible .
you've done it again .
you're the best .
no , i'm just here to help .
all units .
we have a tour bus robbery ...
tour bus robbery .
i've still got time .
officers .
ma'am .
squeaker .
cool !
ready for take off !
what the ...?
who are you supposed to be?
i'm lncrediboy .
what?
no .
you're that kid from the fan club .
brophy .
brody .
buddy !
buddy !
my name is lncrediboy .
i've been nice , i've stood for photos , signed every scrap of paper you pushed at me ...
no , don't worry about training me .
i know your moves , crime fighting style , favorite catch phrases , everything !
i'm your number one fan !
hey !
hey , wait !
you know ... ... you can tell a lot about a woman by the contents of her purse , but maybe that's not what you had in mind .
hey , look ...
elastigirl .
mr. incredible .
it's all right .
i've got him .
sure , you've got him .
i just took him out for you .
sure , you did .
his attention was on me .
a fact i exploited to do my job .
my job , you mean .
a simple thank you will suffice .
thanks , but i don't need any help .
whatever happened to " ladies first "?
well , whatever happened to equal treatment?
look , the lady got me first .
well , we could share , you know .
i work alone .
well , i think you need to be more ... ... flexible .
are you doing anything later?
i have a previous engagement .
now , you just stay here .
they usually pick up the garbage in an hour .
hey , lncredible !
hey , frozone !
shouldn't you be getting ready?
i still got time .
he's gonna jump !
i think you broke something .
with counseling , i think you'll come to forgive me .
wait a minute .
bomb voyage .
and lncrediboy !
aren't you curious about how i get around so fast?
i have rocket boots .
go home , buddy .
now .
what?
can we talk?
you always say be true to yourself , but you never say which part to be true to .
well , i've finally figured out who i am .
i am your ward ...
incrediboy !
and now , you have officially carried it too far , buddy .
this is because i don't have powers , isn't it?
not every superhero has powers , you know .
you can be super without them .
i invented these .
i can fly .
can you fly?
fly home , buddy .
i work alone .
just give me one chance !
i'll show you .
i'll go get the police .
buddy , don't !
it'll only take a second , really .
no , stop !
there's a bomb !
let go , you're wrecking my flight pattern .
i can do this if you let go !
will you just ...?
i'm trying to help !
stop !
let go of my cape !
take this one home .
and make sure his mom knows what he's been doing .
i can help you .
you're making a mist ...
the injured jumper .
you sent paramedics?
they picked him up .
the blast in that building was caused by bomb voyage who i caught robbing the vault .
we might nab him if we set up a perimeter .
he got away?
well , yeah .
skippy here made sure of that .
lncrediboy .
you're not affiliated with me !
holy smokes , i'm late .
listen , i've gotta be somewhere .
what about bomb voyage?
any other night , i'd go after him , but i really gotta go .
don't worry .
we'll get him !
eventually !
is the night still young?
you're very late .
how do i look?
good?
the mask .
you still got the mask .
showtime .
robert parr , will you have this woman to be your lawful wedded wife?
you're late .
when you asked if i was doing anything later ,
i didn't realize you'd forgotten .
i thought it was playful banter .
it was .
cutting it close , don't you think?
you need to be more ... flexible .
i love you , but if we're gonna make this work , you've gotta be more than mr. incredible .
you know that .
don't you? ... so long as you both shall live?
i do .
i pronounce this couple husband and wife .
as long as we both shall live .
no matter what happens .
hey , come on .
we're superheroes .
what could happen?
in a stunning turn of events , a superhero is being sued for saving someone who , apparently , didn't want to be saved .
the plaintiff , oliver sansweet , who was foiled in his attempted suicide by mr. incredible , has filed suit against the famed superhero in superior court .
mr. sansweet didn't ask to be saved .
he didn't want to be saved .
the injury received from mr. incredible's " actions " ,
causes him daily pain .
i saved your life !
you didn't save my life !
you ruined my death .
my client has no comment .
another suit was filed by victims of the el train accident .
incredible's court losses cost the government millions .
and opened the flood gates for dozens of superhero lawsuits the world over .
it is time for their secret identity to become their only identity .
time for them to join us , or go away .
under public pressure , and the financial burden of an ever mounting series of lawsuits , the government quietly initiated the superhero relocation program .
the supers were granted amnesty from responsibility for past actions , in exchange for the promise to never again resume hero work .
where are they now?
they are living among us .
average citizens , average heroes .
quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place .
denied?
you're denying my claim?
i don't understand .
i have full coverage .
i'm sorry , mrs. hogenson , but our liability is spelled out in paragraph 1 7 .
it states clearly ...
i can't pay for this .
excuse me .
claims , bob parr .
i'm calling to celebrate a momentous occasion .
we're now officially moved in .
yeah , well , that's great , honey .
the last three years don't count because ...
because i finally unpacked the last box .
now , it's official .
ha , ha , ha .
why do we have so much junk?
listen , i've got a client .
say no more .
go save the world one policy at a time , honey .
oh !
i gotta go pick up the kids .
see you tonight .
bye , honey .
excuse me .
where were we?
i'm on a fixed income , and if you can't help me ,
i don't know what i'll do .
all right , listen closely .
i'd like to help you , but i can't .
i'd like to tell you to take a copy of your policy to norma wilcox on ... [ whispering ]
norma wilcox .
w l l c o x. on the third floor .
but i can't .
i also do not advise you to fill out and file a ws2475 form with our legal department on the second floor .
i wouldn't expect someone to get back to you quickly to resolve the matter .
i'd like to help , but there's nothing i can do .
oh , thank you , young man .
sorry .
i know you're upset !
pretend to be upset .
parr !
you authorized payment on the walker policy !
someone broke into their house , mr. huph .
their policy covers ...
i don't wanna know about it .
don't tell me about it .
tell me how you're keeping lnsuricare in the black .
tell me how that's possible , with you writing checks to every harry hardluck and sally sobstory that gives you a phone call .
morning break is over .
morning break is over .
i appreciate you coming down here , mrs. parr .
what's this about?
has dash done something wrong?
he's a disruptive influence and he openly mocks me in front of the class .
he says .
look , i know it's you !
he puts thumbtacks on my stool .
you saw him do this?
well ... not really .
no .
actually , not .
oh , then how do you know it was him?
i hid a camera .
yeah , and this time , i've got him .
see?
you see?
you don't see it?
he moves !
right there !
wait , wait !
right there !
right as i'm sitting down !
i don't know how he does it , but there's no tack before he moves and after he moves , there's a tack .
coincidence?
i think not !
bernie ...
don't " bernie " me .
this little rat is guilty !
you and your son can go now , mrs. parr .
i'm sorry for the trouble .
you're letting him go again?
he's guilty !
you can see it on his smug little face .
guilty , i say , guilty !
dash , this is the third time this year you've been sent to the office .
we need to find a better outlet .
a more ... constructive outlet .
maybe i could , if you'd let me go out for sports .
honey , you know why we can't do that .
i promise i'll slow up .
i'll only be the best by a tiny bit .
dashiell robert parr , you are an incredibly competitive boy .
and a bit of a showoff .
the last thing you need is temptation .
you always say , " do your best .
but you don't really mean it .
why can't i do the best that i can do?
right now , honey , the world just wants us to fit in , and to fit in , we just gotta be like everybody else .
dad always said our powers were nothing to be ashamed of .
our powers made us special .
everyone's special , dash .
which is another way of saying no one is .
rydinger , where you headed?
hi , tony .
hey .
hey , tony , can i carry your books?
that's kind of funny .
hey , tony , do you play football?
tony , i thought we were gonna go swimming .
he looked at me .
come on , violet !
darn kids .
sitting on the driveway ...
oh , great .
mom .
you're making weird faces again .
no , i'm not .
you make weird faces , honey .
do you have to read at the table?
uh huh .
yeah .
smaller bites , dash .
yikes !
bob , could you help the carnivore cut his meat .
dash , you have something you wanna tell your father about school?
well , we dissected a frog .
dash got sent to the office again .
good .
good .
no , bob , that's bad .
what?
dash got sent to the office again .
what? !
what for?
nothing .
he put a tack on the teacher's chair ... during class .
nobody saw me .
you could barely see it on the tape .
they caught you on tape and you still got away with it?
whoa !
you must have been booking .
how fast were you going?
we are not encouraging this .
i'm not , i'm just asking how fast ...
honey !
great .
first the car , now i gotta pay to fix the table ...
what happened to the car?
here .
i'm getting a new plate .
so , how about you , vi?
how was school?
nothing to report .
you've hardly touched your food .
i'm not hungry for meatloaf .
well , it is leftover night .
we have steak , pasta ...
what are you hungry for?
tony rydinger .
shut up .
well , you are .
i said , shut up , you little insect .
well , she is .
do not shout at the table .
honey !
kids !
listen to your mother .
she'd eat if we were having tony loaf .
that's it !
stop it !
you're gonna be toast !
stop running in the house .
sit down !
hey , no force fields !
you started it .
you sit down !
you sit down !
violet !
simon j. paladino ,
iongtime advocate of superhero rights , is missing "?
gazerbeam .
bob !
it's time to engage .
do something !
don't just stand there !
i need you to intervene !
you want me to intervene?
okay .
i'm intervening !
violet , let go of your brother .
hello?

hey , lucius !
hey , speedo .
helen , vi , jack jack .
lce of you to drop by .
ha !
never heard that one before .
lucius !
whoa !
ha , ha .
oh !
i like it when it shatters .
i'll be back later .
where are you two going?
it's wednesday .
bowling night .
say hello to honey for me , lucius .
will do .
good night , helen .
good night , kids .
don't think you've avoided talking about the principal's office .
your father and i are still gonna discuss it .
i'm not the only kid who's been sent to the office .
other kids don't have superpowers .
now , it's perfectly normal ...
what do you know about normal?
what does anyone in this family know about normal?
now , wait a minute , young lady .
we act normal .
i wanna be normal .
the only normal one is jack jack , and he's not even toilet trained .
lucky .
i meant about being normal .
so now i'm in deep trouble .
i mean , one more jolt of this death ray and i'm an epitaph .
somehow i managed to find cover .
what does baron von ruthless do?
he starts monologuing .
he starts monologuing .
he starts this prepared speech about how feeble i am compared to him .
how inevitable my defeat is , the world will soon be his .
yada , yada , yada .
yammering .
yammering .
i mean , the guy has me on a platter , and he won't shut up .
municiberg , we have a 23 56 ...
23 56 , what is that?
robbery?
this is just sad .
want to catch a robber?
no .
tell you the truth , i'd rather go bowling .
look , what if we actually did what our wives think we're doing?
just to shake things up .
he's not alone .
the fat guy's still with him .
they're just talking .
what are we doing here?
protecting people .
nobody asked us .
you need an invitation?
i'd like one , yes .
we keep sneaking out to do this , and ...
you remember gazerbeam?
there was something in the paper .
he had trouble with civilian life .
when did you see him?
i don't see anyone from the old days .
just you .
and we're pushing our luck as it is .
come on .
it was fun the first time , but if we keep doing this ...
we have a report on a fire ...
a fire .
we're close !
yeah , baby !
we're gonna get caught .
fire !
yeah !
is that everybody?
yeah .
it better be .
can't you put this out?
i can't lay down a layer thick enough !
it's evaporating too fast !
what's that mean?
it means it's hot .
i'm dehydrated , bob .
you're out of ice?
you can't run out .
you can use water in the air .
there is no water in this air !
what's your excuse , run out of muscle?
i can't smash walls .
the building's getting weaker .
it's gonna come down on top of us .
i wanted to go bowling !
all right !
stay right on my tail !
this is gonna get hot !
yeah .
uh oh .
oh , good .
that ain't right .
we look like incompetent bad guys !
you can get water out of the air .
freeze !
freeze !
i'm thirsty .
i said freeze !
i'm just getting a drink .
you've had your drink .
now ...
i know .
i know .
freeze .
police officers !
that was way too close .
we are not doing that again .
verify you want to switch targets?
over .
trust me .
this is the one he's been looking for .
i thought you'd be back by 1 1 .
i said i'd be back later .
i assumed you'd be back later .
if you came back at all ...
... you'd be " back later " .
well , i'm back , okay?
is this rubble?
it was just a little workout .
just to stay loose .
you know how i feel about that .
darn you !
we can't blow cover again .
the building was coming down anyway .
what?
you knocked down a building?
it was on fire .
structurally unsound .
it was coming down .
have you been listening to the police scanner again?
i performed a public service .
you act like that's a bad thing .
it is a bad thing , bob !
uprooting our family again , so you can relive the glory days is a bad thing .
it's better than acting like they didn't happen !
yes !
they happened !
but this , our family , is what's happening now , bob .
and you are missing this !
i can't believe you don't want to go to your own son's graduation .
it's not a graduation .
he's moving from fourth to fifth grade .
it's a ceremony !
it's psychotic !
they keep creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity but if someone is exceptional ...
this is not about you , bob .
it's about dash .
you want to do something for dash?
let him actually compete .
let him go out for sports !
i will not be made the enemy !
you know why we can't do that .
because he'd be great .
this is not about you !
all right , dash .
i know you're listening .
come on out .
vi?
you , too , young lady .
come on .
come on out .
it's okay , kids .
we're just having a discussion .
pretty loud discussion .
but that's okay .
what's important is that mommy and i are a team .
we're united , uh , against forces of ...
pigheadedness?
i was gonna say evil .
we're sorry we woke you .
everything's okay .
go back to bed .
it's late .
good night , mom .
night , dad .
good night .
in fact , we should all be in bed .
request claim on claim numbers 158183 ... [ on phone ]
request claim on claim numbers 1 58 183 ...
haven't you got him yet?
where is he?
mr. huph would like to talk to you in his office .
now?
now .
sit down , bob .
i'm not happy , bob .
not happy .
ask me why .
okay .
why?
why what?
be specific , bob .
why are you unhappy?
your customers make me unhappy .
what , you've gotten complaints?
complaints i can handle .
what i can't handle is your customers 'inexplicable knowledge of lnsuricare's inner workings !
they're experts .
experts , bob !
exploiting every loophole , dodging every obstacle !
they're penetrating the bureaucracy !
did i do something illegal?
no .
we shouldn't help our customers?
the law requires that i answer no .
we're supposed to help people .
help our people !
starting with our stockholders .
who's helping them out , huh?
you know , bob , a company ...
is like an enormous clock . ... is like an enormous ...
yes .
precisely .
it only works if all the little cogs mesh together .
now , a clock needs to be cleaned , well lubricated and wound tight .
the best clocks have jewel movements , cogs that fit , that cooperate by design .
i'm being metaphorical , bob .
know what i mean by cooperative cogs?
bob?
bob?
look at me when i'm talking to you , parr .
that man out there , he needs help .
don't change the subject .
we're discussing your attitude .
he is getting mugged !
well , let's hope we don't cover him .
i'll be right back .
stop right now or you're fired !
close the door .
get over here , now .
i'm not happy , bob .
not happy .
he got away .
good thing , too .
you were this close to losing your ...
uh oh .
please report to operating room 722 immediately .
how is he?
he'll live .
i'm fired , aren't l?
you think?
what can i say , rick?
nothing you haven't said before .
someone was in trouble .
always .
i had to do something .
every time you say that , it's a month and a half of trouble for me .
hundreds of thousands of taxpayer's dollars .
i know .
we pay to keep the company quiet .
we pay damages , erase memories , relocate your family .
every time it gets harder .
money , money , money .
we can't keep doing this .
we appreciate what you did in the old days , but those days are over .
from now on , you're on your own .
listen , bob .
maybe i could relocate you , you know , for old times 'sake .
i can't do that to my family .
everyone just got settled .
i'll make it work .
thanks .
take care of yourself .
what are you waiting for?
i don't know .
something amazing , i guess .
me , too , kid .
huh?
hold still "?
mr. incredible .
room is secure .
commence message .
hello , mr. incredible .
yes , we know who you are .
rest assured , your secret is safe with us .
my name is mirage .
we have something in common .
according to the government , neither of us exist .
please pay attention , as this message is classified and will not be repeated .
i represent a top secret division of the government , designing and testing experimental technology , and we have need of your unique abilities .
something happened at our testing facility .
honey !
huh?
what?
dinner's ready .
okay . ... it is contained within an isolated area , it threatens to cause incalculable damage to itself and our facilities , jeopardizing hundreds of millions of dollars ...
is someone in there?
it's the tv , trying to watch .
because of its sensitive nature ...
stop .
it's time for dinner .
one minute !
if you accept , your payment will be triple your current annual salary .
call the number on the card .
voice matching will ensure security .
the supers aren't gone , mr. incredible .
you're still here .
you can still do great things .
or ... ... you can listen to police scanners .
your choice .
you have 24 hours to respond .
think about it .
this message will self destruct .
uh oh .
you are one distracted guy .
am l?
i don't mean to be .
i know you miss being a hero and your job is frustrating .
i just want you to know how much it means to me that you stay at it anyway .
honey?
about the job?
what?
something's happened .
what?
the , uh ...
what?
the company is sending me to , uh , a conference .
a conference?
out of town .
i'm gonna be gone for a few days .
they've never sent you to a conference before .
this is good , isn't it?
yes .
you see?
they're finally recognizing your talents .
you're moving up .
yes .
honey !
this is wonderful !
yes , it is .
hello?
this is mr. incredible .
i'm in .
the omnidroid 9000 is a top secret prototype battle robot .
its artificial intelligence enables it to solve any problem it's confronted with .
and , unfortunately ...
let me guess .
it got smart enough to wonder why it had to take orders .
we lost control .
now it's loose in the jungle , threatening our facility .
we've had to evacuate all personnel from the island for their own safety .
how am i going in?
the omnidroid's defenses necessitate an air drop from 5000 feet .
its cloaking devices make it difficult to track .
we're pretty sure it's on the southern half of the island .
one more thing .
obviously it represents a significant investment .
you want me to shut it down without destroying it .
you are mr. incredible .
i've got to warn you , it's a learning robot .
every moment you fight it increases its knowledge of how to beat you .
shut it down .
do it quickly .
don't destroy it .
and don't die .
great .
thanks .
showtime .
huh?
hmm .
uh oh .
oh , my back !
oh !
surprising .
we must bring him back .
sound the all clear , and invite him to dinner .
most important , keep things light .
praise him .
make him feel like we appreciate his abilities .
am i overdressed?
actually , you look rather dashing .
i take it our host is ...
i'm sorry .
he won't be dining with us .
he hopes you'll understand .
of course .
i do usually make it a point to know who i'm working for .
he prefers a certain amount of anonymity .
surely , you of all people understand that .
i was just wondering , of all the places to settle down , why live ...
with a volcano?
he's attracted to power .
so am l .
it's a weakness we share .
seems a bit unstable .
i prefer to think of it as misunderstood .
aren't we all?
volcanic soil is among the most fertile on earth .
everything at the table was grown right here .
how does it compare?
everything's delicious .
jeez .
hurry , honey .
or you'll be late for work .
have a great day , honey .
thanks .
help customers , climb ladders ...
bring bacon .
all that jazz .
you have an appointment?
i'm an old friend .
i just wanted to ...
all visitors are required ...
go check the electric fence .
what is it?
who are you?
what do you want?
my god , you've gotten fat .
come in .
come , come .
y es , things are going quite well .
quite well .
my god , no complaints .
but , you know , it is not the same .
not the same at all .
weren't you in the news?
some show in prayge ...
prague?
milan , darling .
milan .
supermodels .
nothing super about them .
spoiled , stupid , little stick figures with poofy lips who think only about themselves .
feh !
i used to design for gods .
but perhaps you come with a challenge , eh?
i was surprised to get your call .
e , i just need a patch job .
hmm .
this is megamesh .
outmoded , but very sturdy .
and you've torn right through it !
what have you been doing , robert?
moonlighting hero work?
must have happened a long time ago .
i see .
this is a hobo suit , darling .
you can't be seen in this .
i won't allow it !
fifteen years ago , maybe , but now?
what do you mean?
you designed it .
i never look back , darling .
it distracts from the now .
you need a new suit .
that much is certain .
a new suit?
where the heck am i gonna get a new suit?
you can't !
it's impossible !
i'm far too busy .
so ask me now , before i again become sane .
wait .
you want to make me a suit?
you push too hard , darling !
but i accept .
it will be bold .
dramatic !
yeah .
heroic !
yeah , something classic , like dynaguy !
oh !
he had a great look !
oh , the cape and the boots ...
no capes !
lsn't that my decision?
do you remember thunderhead?
tall , storm powers .
nice man .
good with kids .
listen , e ...
november 1 5th of '58 .
all was well , another day saved when his cape snagged on a missile fin .

helen parr?
you know ...
elastigirl?
darling !
it's been such a long time after all these years !
so long !
it's been a while .
there's only one person bob would trust to patch his supersuit .
that's you .
yes , yes , yes .
marvelous , isn't it?
much better than those horrible pajamas he used to wear .
they are finished .
when are you coming to see?
i'm calling about ...
don't make me beg .
i won't do it , you know .
beg , no , i'm calling about suit .
bob's suit !
i'm calling about bob's suit .
you come in one hour , darling .
i insist , okay?
okay .
goodbye .
hmm .
it's bigger !
it's badder !
ladies and gentlemen , it's too much for mr. incredible !
it's finally ready .
you know , i went through quite a few supers to get it worthy to fight you , but man , it wasn't good enough !
after you trashed the last one , i had to make some major modifications .
sure it was difficult , but you are worth it .
i mean , after all , i am your biggest fan .
buddy?
my name is not buddy !
and it's not lncrediboy either !
that ship has sailed .
all i wanted was to help you .
i only wanted to help !
and what did you say to me?
fly home , buddy .
i work alone .
it tore me apart .
but i learned an important lesson .
you can't count on anyone .
especially your heroes .
i was wrong to treat you that way .
i'm sorry .
see?
now you respect me , because i'm a threat .
that's the way it works .
there's a lot of people , whole countries who want respect .
and they will pay through the nose to get it .
how do you think i got rich?
i invented weapons .
now i have a weapon only i can defeat .
and when i unleash it , i'll get ...
you sly dog !
you got me monologuing .
i can't believe it .
it's cool , huh?
zero point energy .
i save the best inventions for myself .
am i good enough now?
who's super now?
i'm syndrome !
your nemesis and ...
oh , brilliant !
all right , try this one on for size , big boy .
gazerbeam .
kronos?
life reading negative .
mr. incredible terminated .
this project has completely confiscated my life , darling .
consumed me as only hero work can .
my best work , i must admit .
simple , elegant , yet bold .
you will die .
e , i just ...
i did robert's suit , and it turned out so beautiful , i had to continue .
it's great to see you , but i have no idea what you're talking about .
i just ...
yes , words are useless .
gobble , gobble , gobble .
too much of it , darling .
too much !
that is why i show you my work .
that is why you are here .
edna mode .
and guest .
come .
sit .
cream and sugar?
thanks .
i started with the baby .
started?
shh !
darling !
i cut it a little roomy for the free movement .
the fabric is comfortable for sensitive skin ,
completely bulletproof .
and machine washable , darling .
that's a new feature .
what on earth do you think the baby will be doing?
well , i'm sure i don't know , darling .
luck favors the prepared .
i didn't know the baby's powers , so i covered the basics .
jack jack doesn't have any powers .
no?
well , he'll look fabulous anyway .
your boy's suit i designed to withstand enormous friction without heating up or wearing out .
a useful feature .
your daughter's suit was tricky .
i finally created a sturdy material that will disappear completely as she does .
your suit can stretch as far as you can , without injuring yourself , and still retain its shape .
virtually indestructible ... ... yet it breathes like egyptian cotton .
as an extra feature , each suit contains a homing device , giving you the precise global location of the wearer at the touch of a button .
well , darling?
what do you think?
what do i think?
bob is retired !
i'm retired !
our family is underground .
you helped my husband resume secret hero work behind my back?
well , i assumed you knew , darling .
why would he keep secrets from you?
he wouldn't .
didn't .
doesn't .
men at robert's age are often unstable .
prone to weakness .
what are you saying?
do you know where he is?
of course .
do you know where he is?
hey , hey .
we got a man down !
come on , let's go .
are you okay?
what happened?
break surveillance and engage .
continuing sweep ...
insuricare .
oh , hello .
this is helen parr .
bob parr is my husband .
i was wondering if you could give me the number of the hotel he's staying at?
the number i have is no good .
mr. parr no longer works here .
what do you mean?
he's on a business trip .
a company retreat .
my records say he was terminated almost two months ago .
so , you don't know where he is .
would you like to find out?
i am such an idiot .
i let this happen , you know .
the new sports car , the getting in shape , the blond hair , the lies .
yes , he attempts to relive the past .
now i'm losing him !
what'll i do?
what'll i do?
what are you talking about?
you are elastigirl !
my god !
pull yourself together .
what will you do?
is this a question?
show him you remember that he is mr. incredible , and you will remind him who you are !
well , you know where he is .
go !
confront the problem !
fight !
win !
and call me when you get back , darling .
i enjoy our visits .
there's lots of leftovers that you can reheat .
make sure dash does his homework .
and both of you , get to bed on time .
i should be back tonight .
late .
you can be in charge that long , can't you?
yeah .
but why am i in charge again?
nothing .
just a little trouble with daddy .
you mean dad's in trouble , or dad is the trouble?
i mean either he's in trouble , or he's going to be .
what's that?
where'd you get that , mom?
you made a cool outfit?
hey , are those for us?
we all get cool outfits?
dash !
you come back here this moment !
hey , snug .
thanks for getting back .
i know this is short notice , but i was hoping that i could ...
what are these?
look , i'm the dash !
the dash likes .
just a second .
take that off before somebody sees .
you're packing one just like it .
are you hiding something?
please .
i'm on the phone ...
dash !
this is yours .
it's specially made .
what's going on?
you're not coming !
i gotta pack !
what makes you think it's special?
i don't know .
why'd mom try to hide it?
snug , i'm calling in a solid you owe me .
what do you need?
a jet .
what do you got that's fast?
let me think .
