some men do .
just being so far from the armada , the mind can start to fill with strange thoughts , doubts .
don't you ever have doubts , vaako?
doubts?
about the campaign .
about lord marshal .
first and always , i am a necromonger commander .
so if you're here to test my loyalty , you succeed only in testing my patience .
oh , no .
no , that's not why i'm here at all .
i'm so glad i could steal you away for a moment .
doesn't it strike you odd?
here we have the current lord marshal ... destroying entire societies , and yet he can't bring himself ... to kill one stranded elemental .
why is that?
you don't pray to our god .
you pray to no god , i hear .
elementals we calculate .
don't we all .
but now let's have first things first .
what of riddick?
in truth , i don't know where he went .
in truth , i'm more interested in where he came from .
watch your step .
i've always wondered , does an air elemental fly?
now do me a favor .
calculate the odds of you getting off this planet alive ... and now cut them in half .
no , we can't fly .
but we glide very well .
save your threats , necromonger .
i would have told you about riddick for the asking .
it concerns a foretelling , a prediction now more than 30 years old .
ayoung warrior once consulted a seer .
he was told a child would be born on the planet furya a male child who would someday cause the warrior's downfall .
cause his untimed death .
furya?
furya's a ruined world .
no life to speak of .
for good reason .
this young warrior mounted an attack on furya , killing all young males he could find , even strangling some with their birth cords .
an artful stroke , wouldn't you say?
so this warrior , the one who tried to outwit the prediction , would later become
that's why he worries .
the lord marshal .
which would make the man child
he worries he missed killing that child in its crib .
riddick .
that's why it's so vital to him .
wait .
it's about a prophecy .
wait !
wait !
are you there?
you do what your lord asks .
you cleanse riddick for him , and in doing so ... you prove your undying loyalty .
and perhaps then he'll finally let down his guard .
still here , i see?
i've been here 1 8 years .
see this?
i remember how gorgeous she was .
well , gorgeous in a certain light .
and now , for the goddamn death of me ,
i cannot remember her name .
feeding time !
we're here for the rest of our unnatural lives .
here they come !
whatever you do , don't make eye contact .
aaah !
it's an animal thing .
check her for me .
she's always got a blade somewhere .
hyah !
i don't think she likes being touched .
i'd take my wounded and go while you still can .
is there a name for this private little world of yours , huh?
what happens there when we don't just run away?
you'll kill us ... with a soup cup?
tea , actually .
what's that?
i'll kill you with my teacup .
you know the rule .
they aren't dead if they're still on the books .
mmm .
come on .
death by teacup .
damn .
why didn't i think of that?
i didn't come to play " who's the better killer?
but it's my favorite game .
haven't you heard?
i heard you came lookin 'for me .
is that all?
then you missed the good part .
hooked up with some mercs outta lupus five .
said they'd take me on , teach me the trade , give me a good cut .
they slaved me out , riddick .
do you know what that could do to you when you're that age?
when you're 1 2 years old?
i told you to stay in new mecca .
did you not listen?
i had mercs on my neck .
i'll always have mercs on my neck .
i spent five years on a frozen heap just to keep 'em away from you .
and you go and sign up with the same fake badges ... that wanted to cut you up and use you for bait .
what are you pitching , riddick?
that you cuttin 'out was a good thing?
that you had my ass covered from halfway across the universe?
you signed with mercs .
there was nobody else around .
let's pop the cork .
get some fresh air .
so they do go topside ... to swap out air .
interesting .
who the hell are you?
when it happens , it'll happen fast .
stay on my leg when i cut fence or stay here ... for the rest of your natural life .
nobody outs this place .
nobody .
he ain't " nobody .
good news first .
talked things over with my amigos here .
we'll cut you in for 77 5k .
well , all right .
what's the bad news?
they close the local whorehouse?
no .
the bad news is worse than that .
much worse .
our pilot , he saw this .
it crossed a shipping lane .
any idea what this might be?
never saw nothin 'like it .
this ship charts back to helion prime .
you know , anatoli's got a nose for trouble , and he thinks trouble follows you here .
look .
we dusted our tracks and got the hell outta there .
there is no way we didn't lose them .
them "?
this is my prisoner .
mine .
nobody else's .
and i want my money now .
so ... you stole a prisoner ... from " them "?
no .
riddick .
no . !
shoulda taken the money , toombs .
you gonna kill me?
mercs .
some guards here , but this can't be all of them .
check their slots in the back and be careful .
don't bother .
guards ain't there .
they figured out the necros are comin'for me .
plan was to clean the bank , ghost the mercs , break wide through the tunnel .
and then somebody got a lucky shot off with this rocket launcher here ... and took out the sled .
guards took off on foot but rigged the door so no one could follow .
they'll take the one ship in the hangar and leave everyone else here to die .
how come you know all this shit?
you weren't even here .
'cause it was my plan .
i shoulda taken the money .
riddick !
what is this?
what is he thinking?
once that sun comes up  we'll last five minutes .
five minutes .
we ain't gonna last 30 seconds out there .
it'll light you up like a match .
20 mile buffer zone and 30 klicks to the hangar .
30 klicks over that terrain?
it's moving in the right direction .
we could make it .
stay behind the night , ahead of the sun .
there's gonna be one speed mine .
if you can't keep up , don't step up .
you'll just die .
riddick?
riddick?
riddick?
go , go !
go on !
go !
climb here !
climb !
go !
go , go , go !
boss !
up there .
take a look .
because anatoli says so?
because his nose says so .
there's nothin 'up here .
oh , shit .
riddick .
they're heading right for the volcano fields .
they're going for our ship . !
no chance do they get to the hangar first .
no chance !
next one !
next hole !
we'll catch 'em there !
no more run for you .
where did the big guy go?
ohh
close it !
what was that?
you don't care if you live or die?
if i kill them first , not really .
maybe i do .
keep moving !
kyra?
kyra !
what?
get that ass moving !
riddick?
remember what i said about not caring if i lived or died?
you knew i was kidding , right?
one speed .
temperature differential .
your rope .
it's too late .
we're never gonna make it .
your rope !
gimme your rope !
and your water .
all of it !
stay in the shadow of the mountain .
don't wait for me .
run !
riddick !
aaah !
where the hell is that hangar?
there it is .
listen .
let me guess .
necros .
and a whole lotta necro firepower .
shit . !
i hate not being the bad guys .
i figure we got three minutes before the sun hits us again , burns out this whole valley .
wait .
we gonna do this or not?
just wait .
ellen .
her name was ellen .
i never really forgot .
aaah !
boss !
remember that favorite game of yours?
" who's the better killer?
let's play .
come on !
on the right !
watch out !
behind you !
kyra . !
sybar !
no . !
aaah !
get up .
get up . !
please get up .
so , you can kneel .
i think you know now .
i think you know who tore furya apart .
this mark carries the anger of an entire race .
but it's going to hurt .
kyra?
i was supposed to deliver a message to you ... if vaako failed to kill you .
a message from the lord marshal himself .
he tells you to stay away from helion , stay away from him , and in return , you'll be hunted no more .
but vaako will most likely report you as dead .
so this is your chance .
your chance to do what no man has ever done .
the girl .
where will they take her?
we all began ... as something else .
i've done ... unbelievable things ... in the name of a faith that was never my own .
and he'll do to her what he did to me .
the necromonger in me warns you not to go back .
but the furyan in me ...
hopes you won't listen .
god knows ...
i've dreamed of it .
i have lost a purifier ... but i have gained a first among commanders .
it is overdue , isn't it that we acknowledge your many accomplishments , your steady faith , and above all , your unflinching loyalty .
obedience without question .
loyalty till underverse come .
well done , vaako .
this is a day of days .
look more pleased , vaako .
you have killed his enemy ... and his suspicions .
i should have brought back his head .
you saw him unbreathing .
you saw him dead on the ground .
riddick was no common breeder .
in a heartbeat he dropped 20 of my men .
all mysteries are not miracles , not even in this religion .
and if you say it is certain , then it is certain , and we've already said it , haven't we?
we have .
now , tell me if it's true .
tell me the furyan is gone , and i can close this campaign without hearing his bootsteps .
if he is dead ,
i sense i'm not far from the same fate , being of no further use here .
shouldn't i tell you that riddick is still alive?
don't try me , aereon .
i could plow you under with the rest of helion prime .
no one really knows the future .
then tell me the odds that vaako met with success , that i will now be the one ... who can carry his people across the threshold into underverse , where they shall begin true life .
tell me what i want to hear , aereon , and maybe i'll save your home world ... for last .
the odds are good ...
that? that you will reach the underverse ...
soon .
ascension protocol !
we still have numbers out there , lord marshal sweep teams , recon ships .
they would be hard pressed to make it back
get my armada off the ground !
you mean on helion?
i mean here , on this very ship !
could you be wrong?
mind fabricates fear .
could you be wrong?
not so wrong as you when you left him alive !
it's twice a mistake .
not only your failure , but now the report of success .
how do we salvage this?
how?
how?
lord marshal's got to be warned .
you will never see the underverse !
he will kill us both before our due time .
i say give riddick his chance .
if he is half of what you think , he can at least wound the lord marshal and that is when you must act .
just to take his place?
just to keep what i kill?
that is the necromonger way .
it is not enough !
then you do it for the faith !
if he has fear , he has weakness .
if he has weakness , vaako
he is unworthy of lordship .
we do it for all necromongers .
protect the faith .
this can still be a day of days , but the timing ... must be flawless .
final protocol .
execute on my order .
go inside .
are they leaving now?
ziza !
go inside !
we found this lensor dead .
show me his last sight .
commander toal .
he won't escape twice .
stay your weapons !
he came for me .
if you fall here now , you'll never rise .
but if you choose another way the necromonger way you'll die in due time ... and rise again in the underverse .
go to him .
it hurts ... at first .
but after a while , the pain goes away , just as they promise .
are you with me , kyra?
there's a moment ... when you can almost see the underverse through his eyes .
it makes it sound perfect a place where anyone can start over .
are you with me , kyra?
convert now ... or fall forever .
you killed everything i know .
vaako .
not yet .
been a long time since i've seen my own blood .
these are his last moments .
give me your soul .
fuck you !
you're not the one to bring me down .
now !
kill the beast while he's wounded !
help me , vaako .
kill him .
vaako?
forgive me .
flawless .
no .
no o o !
now what would be the odds of that?
i thought you were dead .
are you with me , kyra?
i was always with you .
i was .
you keep what you kill .
