that gearhead was being sarcastic and you know it .
i just didn't see it that way .
bullshit .
what about the dig about the makeover?
what do you want me to do?
i work with him , for chrissake .
you're capable of taking care of your own shit .
you know something?

so unless you want to start fucking him , i suggest ...
hey , pal .
where can i catch a shuttle to the airport around here?
right there .

so what?
you'll be up late .
i'm pulling an all nighter too , so save the tears .
i'll take 1 05 east to the 1 1 0 .
it's faster .
what?
the 1 05 to the 1 1 0 will get you there quicker .
the 1 1 0 turns into a parking lot around usc .
but once you get to la brea north of santa monica , it's jammed .
the 1 1 0 north of the 1 0 , you get people driving to pasadena and they drive slow .
yeah , they do , but what i do is i get off on grand and then i ...
surface roads is what you want , that's what we'll do .
are we taking bets?
are we?
and what if you're wrong?
i don't think i'll be wrong , but if i am ... ... your ride's free .
okay , you got yourself a deal .
go ahead , say it .
say what?
go ahead .
i got lucky with the lights .
you weren't lucky .
what you were was right .
i was wrong ... ... max .
you mind turning that up?
you like the classics .
i do .
i used to play in high school .
let me guess .
woodwinds .
no .
strings .
never had the lungs for wind instruments .
could've fooled me the way you were unloading on that cell phone .
different instrument .
lf you had just listened to me , we'd be all bogged down in traffic right now , and you would've made an extra five bucks .
yeah , well , you keep that 5 bucks .
buy you something special .
go wild .
really , it's not a big deal .
nothing big here .
how many cabbies do you know get you into an argument to save you money?
there were two of us .
i had to kill the other one .
i don't like competition .
take pride in being good at what you do?
what , this?
no , this is part time .
this is a fill in job .
pay the bills .
but i will be the best at what i do .
but that's something else .
what else?
just shaping up some things .
like ...?
tell me .
limo company i'm putting together . lsland limos .
it'll be like a island on wheels .
a cool groove , like a club experience .
when you get to the airport , you won't want to get out of my limo .
so i do this part time to get my benz off leases ... staff up , get the right client list .
you know , things like that .
how do you like being a lawyer?
what are you , psychic?
little bit .
there's the dark pinstripe suit .
elegant , not too flashy .
that rules out advertising .
plus a top drawer briefcase that you live out of .
and the purse .

like , i can't wait .
i love standing in that courtroom .
at the same time , i get this ... ... clenched up thing the night before the first days .
clenched up?
how?
i think i'm going to lose .
i think the case sucks , my exhibits aren't in order ,
i'm not prepared enough , people will find out i don't know what i'm doing and i've been running a charade all these years .
i represent the department of justice , and my opening statement will fall flat at the most important point and the jury will laugh at me .
and then i cry .
i don't throw up .
a lot of people throw up .
i have a strong stomach .
and then i pull myself together , i rewrite my opening statement ... work my exhibits and that's what i do for the rest of the night .
that's my routine .
ln the morning it starts and i'm fine .
you need a vacation .
i just had a vacation on the harbor freeway .
not in a cab .
you need to get your head straight .
get your unified self up .

before you know it , he's up on the bandstand , jamming with the band .
i mean , it had to be ...
oh , it was scary .
i mean , the dude was so focused , man .
plus , he was kind of a scary cat anyway .
everybody and their mama knew you don't just come up and talk to miles davis .
i mean , he may have looked like he was chilling , but he was absorbed .
this one young , hip couple , one of them tried to shake his hand one day .
and the guy says , " hi , my name is ...
miles said , " get out of my face , you jive motherfucker .
take your silly bitch with you .
you know?
that was miles , man .
that's the way he was when he was in his musical headspace .
fierce .
but did you get to talk to him?
better than that .
i played for about 20 minutes .
unbelievable .
how'd you do?
how'd i do?
you really ain't shit playing next to miles davis .
but he carried my ass .
what'd he say?
cool .
cool?
that's it?
yeah .
that meant , " good , but not ready .
it meant , " look me up when you are .
did you?
no .
i got drafted and got into some other things .

you know , i was born in 1 945 , but that night was the moment of my conception .
right here in this room .

i will go so far away , it'll be just like i was dead .
these people and their rep here , felix ...
well , you tell them i'm sorry .

they laid a grant of immunity on me .
it was either play ball or go back inside .
and i'm not going back inside .
yeah .

where did miles learn music?
i know everything about miles .
then let's have it .

you must be one of max's important clients .
client?

it's unhealthy .
how many times i got to ask don't do that?
do what?
don't talk about me like i'm not right here in the room here .
what's he saying?
he says he's standing right here in the room here .
yes , you are .
he's sensitive .
i know .
but i'm sure you're very proud of him .
of course i'm proud .
he started with nothing , you know?
look at him today .
here , vegas ...
mom , he is not interested in hearing about all that , okay?
i came to see you , i saw you , you look good , let's go .
i am very interested , lda .
please .
limousine companies . ls that right?
he drives famous people around .
famous people .
limousine companies .

let's see what else you can do .
well , i've had four come in tonight .
maybe one's your guy .
no , not ramone .
let's see this one .
no , next .
there's something funny about this , though .
these three all came in within half an hour of each other , right?
the kid and that last guy , both done by the same shooter , i think .
why do you say that?
wound pattern .
two in the sternum , one in the head .
this guy is shooting tight groups too , all right?
check this out .
double taps are a couple millimeters apart .
let's see this one .
see what i mean?
holy shit .
can i use your phone?
come on , come on , wake up .
hello .
it's fanning .
i'm still down here at the morgue at sisters of charity .
john does didn't pan out , but you'll never guess who's in the meat locker .
who?
sylvester clarke , criminal attorney turned lawyer criminal . " i" ncluding ramone " , " who he represented " , " who s still missing .
both are in the exotic substances business together .
there's something going on , and i don't think the feds know about it .

going to a place called el rodeo .
it's on washington boulevard , pico rivera .
where at on washington?
look it up .
limos , huh?
don't start .
i'm not the one lying to my mother .
she hears what she wants to hear .
i don't disillusion her .
right .
maybe she hears what you tell her .
whatever i tell her's never good enough .
it's always been that way .
so , what's at el rodeo?
just drive .
they project onto you their flaws .
what they don't like about themselves , their lives , whatever .
they rank on you instead .
how do you know?
i had a father like that .
mothers are worse .
wouldn't know .
my mother died before i remember her .
what happened to your father?
hated everything i did .
got drunk , beat me up , foster homes .
went back with him .
like that .
then what?
i killed him .
i was 1 2 .
i'm kidding .
he died of liver disease .
well , i'm sorry .
no , you're not .
so , what is this " driving a cab temporarily . " it's all bullshit?
it is not bullshit .
1 2 years isn't temporary .
got to get the cash together . lnsurance , bonds , maintenance , tires .
got to staff up , get the right client list .
it's not just get the car and put asses in the seats .
why not?
because lsland limos is more than just a ride .
it's like a club experience .
cool groove .
don't want it to end .
it's got to be perfect .

lf i don't pull it off , then ...
