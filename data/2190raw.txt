miss , you okay?
i can`t remember when i had my first waking nightmare .
they`re too disturbing to caii daydreams .
i never talked about them with anyone .
they never made any sense to me ... then i found the pathway .
now they`re aii clear , every one of them .
breakfast of champions .
when was the last time you slept?
i`m happy i can stand , man .
i`m on a three day rage .
your father will kick your ass if you flunk anything .
since when did he need an excuse to do that?
at least you`re out of the house .
hey , l`d trade places with you any day .
what up , jake?
darius .
what`s up?
so you playing ball next year?
i don`t know , man .
get with it .
that`s what you said last term , dawg .
man , the guys around the gym , they tell me you`re the real deal .
what are you staring at?
it ain`t your truck , homey .
easy .
what`s he got there , jake?
nothing , man .
bullshit .
let it go .
just keep your dog on a leash .
all right .
what the fuck were you gonna do , shoot him?
chill .
it only told me to scare him . ``lt``?
what is ``it``?
just give me back the piece .
no , man , no .
are you crazy?
what , do you want to get arrested?
where did you get this?
later .
happy birthday .
joseph campbell believed that the power of myth ... related to certain intrinsic universal values found in all cultures : the need to worship god , to protect the family ... to coexist in harmony with nature .
now , from these very ideas stories were created ... and passed down from one generation to another ... each having its own central hero character .
want to see what you missed?
lf i wanted to see it , i wouldn`t have missed it .
campbell termed this ennobled path
just trying to be helpful .
what a shame .
i thought you wanted to get in my pants .
it is my birthday .
works for me .
but little more than the stories we grow up hearing ... and the tradition of telling them ... is what binds together even the most disparate of societies .
happy birthday , handsome .
how does it feel to be 21?
like l`m on the verge of nothing .
mr. gray , am i interrupting a celebration?
sorry , prof. hartney .
tell me , dakota , what are we to make of this dionysian offering?
mimosas .

what the hell for?
because your time is my money .
and please , watch your fucking language .
aren`t you going to blow it out?

i stopped singing the day they kicked me out of the church choir .
did you go see your mother?
no .
she wasn`t feeling well today , so l`il go see her tomorrow .
how are things going at the mill?

they`d have to close the place down if they got rid of you .
thanks .

but they`re still caught in the rain .
what does that mean?
don`t get wet .
ludes?
x?
what`s your poison , lover boy?
are you peaking or crying?
l`ve had better days , jake .
so what happened?
hartney hit on me again .
what did he say?
fuck or fail .
that`s got a nice ring to it .
well , i ran out of the office .
i bought myself a few days .
why don`t you report him?
he does this all the time .
dean glick won`t do anything .
why not?
l`il give you one guess .
come on , huh?
shit .
fuck . l`il fucking nail both of you , man?
i didn`t call for back up .
you`re welcome .
so , valerie gaines , behind the gym ... senior prom .
you guys thought that we were powdering our noses .
her nose was up my skirt .
man !
jake , what`s our zip code?
98133 .
had you heard that one?
personally , i found it depressing .
that`s just because you weren`t there .
exactly .
what year were you born?
same as you , dumb ass .
so what`s your weirdest family holiday?
fuck that .
we`il be here all night .
what was your weirdest family holiday?
thanksgiving , a couple years ago .
i was building a ramp for my mom`s wheelchair ... and father moore came by to visit .
they were all inside watching football , dallas tampa game .
dallas lost .
that was your weirdest family holiday?
so i had a hammer in my hand ... and i look up and father moore was smiling at me ... and all i could think about is just bashing his head in .
over and over , and then l`d smash my parents` heads in .
then , like , half the people i knew , just ....
so then i started thinking , what else would i like to do?
and all this crazy shit came into my head .
so then what happened?
i finished the ramp , and we ate turkey .
dude , that`s sick even for me .
dude , l`ve castrated my dad 1 1 2 times in my dreams .
three of a kind , huh?
let`s play a real fucked up game .
``welcome to the pathway . ``
the pathway .
l`ve never played this before .
dakota , it`s a secret .
well , it`s not a very good secret if you know about it .
serious .
you give it your phone numbers and stuff ... then it calls you and gives you bizarre things to do .
what kind of bizarre things?
well , you don`t know unless you play .
how do you start?
you already have .
happy birthday .
oh , shit . lt`s , like , my entire life .
wild or what?
dude , you`il never be president .
turn this off .
somebody could be reading this .
nobody cares about the $243 you got left in your bank account .
abort .
fuck !
god , l`m so drunk .
i need another drink .
oh , body shots .
l`il be down in a minute .
enjoy .
what are you doing?
your charity case dropped that off for you .

who is this?
i know what the voices in your head reaily teii you to do .
i don`t know who this is .
i don`t have time to play games .
you wouldn`t have iet conrad sign you on ... if you weren`t iooking for a distraction from your dreary world .
happy birthday .
this is the pathway?
today we find a way to get even with an asshole of your choosing .
have anybody in mind?
my boss .
what would you iike to do to him?
kill him .
you`d only be doing him a favor .
enjoy your first day off ... then come back tomorrow and see what the pathway does for you .
somebody order an orchid?
don`t expect a tip .
so you been thinking about me?
only between my dance classes .
how are you doing?
l`m good .
yeah?
yeah .
how`s your job going?
lt`s going great .
you and your dad getting along?
yeah , like family .
that bad , huh?
maybe i should move back home .
this place is breaking us .
no .
there`d be no one to look after you all day .
dad and i are fine .
you were always such a terrible liar .
where`s your blanket?
l`m going to get you a blanket .
hang on .
excuse me , nurse .
can we get a blanket for my ....
marisol .
jake .
what are you doing here?
you two know each other?
yeah , she came into the computer shop .
jake saved my life .
it was just a circuit board .
so you`re the one that brings kathy the orchids?
yeah .
you wanted a blanket . l`il get you blanket .
thanks for the cards .
you`re welcome .
small world , huh?
yeah .
i like it that way , though .
behave , mom .
why should i start now?
there he is .
that`s the kid that robbed me .
arrest him .
take it easy .
no .
i fired this kid yesterday .
he comes back last night and rips me off .
i just came by to get my money .
he owes me two weeks pay .
were you in here last night?
no .
okay .
all right .
you know what?
let`s check out the hidden surveillance cameras and we`il see what we see .
didn`t know we had those , did you , jake?
l`m just going to start this from when i left here last night .
what the ....
that can`t be me .
you doctored the tape .
you little prick .
don`t you see?
he`s goddamn smart .
god , you screwed me , gray !
how`d you do it , huh?
so then who were those guys on the videotape?
i don`t know .
that`s why l`m trying to hack into the site .
well , whoever they are , i wouldn`t piss them off .
yeah .
shit .
since when are you into voodoo?
they`re spiritual interpretations of universal ideas .
that`s what it said on the box .
so what did it have to say about these guys?
``the figures suggest youth , love , and virginity ... ``before they`re corrupted by desire . ``
remember taking my virginity?
lf i recall , i think it was you that took mine .
details .
should we light a candle or something?
so much for cuddling .
well , jake , you got what you wanted ... and i get to keep playing the pathway .
you just made love to me because the pathway told you to?
no , jake , i fucked you because the pathway told me to .
when did you start playing the pathway?
like you care .
like you`ve ever really given a shit about me , jake .
like any man ever has .
see you on campus .
hello .
feeling distracted?
beats watching tv .
are you ready for another test?
i thought that was dakota`s test .
besides , it`s not exactly our first time .
with her in controi it was .
i thought the point was to entertain me .
no , the point was to see what`s inside your head .
dinner`s ready .
trying to break my hand?
what`s the matter , you pull something?
just throw the goddamn ball .
let me see .
darius do that?
with a little help .
damn it , connie , i can`t baby sit you day and night .
who asked you to?
don`t give me that shit . l`ve been covering your back since we were nine .
why don`t you stop already?
okay .
sorry , man .
i think l`m building up a resistance to my medication .
yeah , i think we`re both losing it .
listen to this shit .
the other night , l`m down in the basement .
i get a phone call from the pathway .
i turn around .
there`s a big creature staring at me .
a creature .
half man , half woman .
anyway , i have this dream where i go upstairs ... and i shoot my dad in the back of the head .
has trippy stuff like that been happening to you?
every goddamn day .
great .
l`il take it easy on you .
right .
hello .
lakey .
got two girls in my room .
i can`t get them to leave .
nice , man .
why didn`t you give me a shout?
yeah , like l`m going to have you by .
they would have taken one look at you and kicked my ass out of bed .
ls something wrong?
i don`t know , man . l`m spent .
you know?
all right , dude .
be careful .
why don`t we get breakfast in the morning?
okay .
i`ii caii you in the morning .
hey , jake .
yeah .
fuck you .
dude , what the fuck do you want now?
nobody knows how fucked up you reaily are .
and nobody reaily gives a fuck , do they?
what the fuck !
connie .
connie , let`s go get some breakfast , bud .
or more like lunch .
connie , wake up .
uncle ross .
he didn`t sound good .
i should have come over .
you could have wound up dead , too .
conrad wasn`t a psychopath .
he was always on the edge .
this thing with darius just pushed him over it .
no .
those guys would fight one day , and then they`d get high the next .
l`m sure their parents will be comforted to hear that .
did you help conrad steal that gun?
what?
the serial numbers matched a . 38 stolen from sid`s sporting goods last week .
that`s impossible .
why is that?
because i threw that gun into cove lake .
you what?
i took a gun from connie ....
i didn`t want him to get in trouble , so i threw it in the lake .
how would conrad have gotten the gun back?
he couldn`t have .
this is a bad time to start lying to me .
l`m not lying to you .
you think i don`t want to find out what went on in there?
you going to tell my sister or am l?
yeah , i want to go to the hospital now , if i can .
you know , l`m your uncle .
you could have brought the gun to me .
are you okay?
lt`s the worst day of my life .
you want to talk about it?
not here .
meet me in front in five minutes .
okay?
okay .
i just don`t want to end up like my father .
go to work at 6 : 00 , come home at 8 : 00 .
do it all over again the next day .
what do you want to do?
i wish i knew .
have you ever thought about leaving here?
who`d bring my mom orchids?
l`m sure she would love postcards .
looks like you like to travel .
yeah .
i like collecting things .
how did you end up here?
a man .
sorry , i didn`t mean to pry .
no , it`s okay .
l`m just enjoying this one too much .
so how about you?
are you seeing anybody?
took you long enough to ask .
i take that as a no .
no .
but who knows , i could always run into someone when l`m not expecting it .
that never happens .
what timing .
all i want to do is leave this town , and you just got here .
we just have to meet somewhere in the middle .
okay .
well , you were right .
the day did get better .
l`m sorry about your friend .
so l`m going to try to play it cool and not call you for at least an hour , okay?
okay .
bye , jake .
bye .
i remember when you and connie first met in sunday school .
you`re drinking?
well , l`m not praying .
you`re going to throw away five years just like that?
you think i don`t know what you and conrad have been doing to yourselves , son?
you think i don`t know that?
what conrad did has nothing to do with me .
he`s gone to hell .
i don`t have to listen to this .
wait just a minute , jake .
wait a minute .
wait .
we`re not going to be able to save you now .
don`t preach to me with a drink in your hand , dad .
you ungrateful punk .
you realize that we have sacrificed everything for you here?
sacrificed?
you sacrificed?
i could`ve gone anywhere , i could`ve done anything ... but i stayed here for you , i stayed here for mom .
what did you ever give up for me?
my beautiful wife .
what does that mean?
i thought i could do this , but i can`t .
thought you could do what?
what are you trying to tell me?
you`re blaming me for the way mom is ... for the accident?
you`re gonna blame me for that now?
the day after my best friend kills himself , you`re gonna blame me for that?
lt`s not very much , though , jake .
the day i need you the most , the day i need help , the day i need my father ... you do this?
shame on you .
jake?
i don`t know whether to cry or scream .
i know what you mean .
you know , i called you six times .
l`m really sorry about what happened the other night .
don`t worry about it .
so why didn`t you call me back?
i was hanging out with a friend .
who is she?
her name is marisol .
sounds exotic .
she`s different .
l`m super late .
dakota , hey .
you heard what conrad did to himself , right?
can`t stop thinking about it .
well , the other night , after i got off the phone with the pathway ...
i had a dream where i did the same thing to myself .
you think that the pathway has something to do with what conrad did to himself?
yeah , maybe .
are you still playing?
it hasn`t asked me to corrupt anyone else , if that`s what you`re asking .
all right .
do me a favor .
anything .
stop .
sure .
come by the tomahawk tonight .
dinner`s on me .
and bring your friend .
you sure you want company tonight?
no , but i like being with you .
good .
okay , now l`m jealous .
marisol , this is dakota .
nice to meet you .
god , marisol .
that`s such a beautiful name .
thank you .
what does it mean?
lt`s spanish for ``sun and sea . ``
oh , my parents named me for where i was conceived .
i would really love to stay here and chat with you guys ... but my boss is totally riding my ass .
lt`s okay .
we`re just going to do take out .
so two burgers , two fries , and two beers .
we`re not staying?
no .
i got a surprise for you .
now this would be the part where i get ill .
sorry .
looking for the men`s room .
you know where the men`s room is , professor .
you eat here twice a week .
so , have you thought about our little conversation after class?
professor , you twist that ring any harder , and your finger`s going to come off .
l`ve got plenty more .
asshole !
tomahawk .
even hartney knows you are weak .
every man does .
why do you think lake would never be with you for more than one night?
he knows you`ve fucked aii his friends .
who wants a giri iike that?
i know .
it wasn`t your fault .
daddy was a monster .
but then , iet`s face it .
lots of girls have bad fathers , and they don`t end up iike you .
get used to it .
you iet hartney fuck you over ... and you`re going to be working in dumps iike this for the rest of your miserable iife .
is that what you want?
fuck you .
fuck all of you !
that`s my girl .
didn`t that feei good?
don`t you understand that i want to help you ... make you feei better ... help you get even with hartney before it`s too iate .
yes .
don`t be afraid .
it`s time to play .
when i was nine months old , my folks moved here from seattle ... to be near my uncle , my mother`s brother .
there was a blizzard and my dad lost control of the car .
it was a miracle any of us survived .
there`s a higher power looking out for you .
ls she okay?
l`il call her later .
we are late .
late for what?
lt`s so worth the pain .
i promise .
i need some more medicine , nurse .
ready?
yeah .
one , two , three , go .
i hope you can fight .
i never put an orchid on a guy before .
lt`s for my mother , walt .
okay , now you`re breaking my heart .
sorry .
quit smoking yesterday .
great .
jake .
what have you and your friends gotten into?
nothing .
first conrad , now dakota kills your professor and mutilates herself .
this is no coincidence .
you could be next .
i am not going to let that happen .
all right , can you take him home?
make sure he gets some sleep?
listen to me .
first thing tomorrow morning , you meet me at my cabin .
no one will disturb us there .
but we`re not leaving until you tell me everything you know .
uncle ross .
nine points?
didn`t hear you drive in .
so , how are you holding up?
fine .
yeah?
what`s in the ground?
after a hunt , we bury the animal`s remains .
native american ritual i taught jake when he was a kid .
returns the animal`s soul to the earth .
well , come on in .
when we started , the pathway was just a game ... that had this strange ability of knowing what we were thinking .
but then conrad used the gun that i threw into the lake ... and then cuts his tongue off ... the way that i did after a beast in a dream tells me to .
so l`m thinking maybe it wasn`t a dream .
maybe it isn`t just a game .
i feel like l`m going insane .
no , i think you`re just looking for an answer for something so horrible it has none .
i like it here .
lt`s peaceful .
thanks .
well , i have to meet the fbl in my office in a couple hours .
l`il ask them to check on this computer game of yours .
why don`t you spend the night here?
it might do you some good .
sheriff north .
what is it?
something`s wrong .
l`m sorry , i think we ought to go .
okay .
jake , talk to me .
shit .
give rest , o christ , to your servant with your saints .
where sorrow and pain are no more .
neither sighing , but life everlasting .
you only are immortal , the creator and maker of all .
we are mortal , formed of the earth ... and to the earth we shall return .
for so did you ordain when you created us , saying : ``you are dust , and to dust you shall return . ``
all of us go down to the dust ... yet even at the grave we make our song .
hallelujah , hallelujah , hallelujah .
you know , you say there`s a higher power looking out for me?
well , i need him now .
he`s not here .
jake , what is it?
i have to go see an old friend .
jacob , why this sudden interest in satan?
do you think he really exists?
many in the church take the devil quite literally ... but i think of him as a symbol of temptation , not as a beast with a pitchfork and horns .
what does it say in the bible about possession or self mutilation?
you think that your two friends were possessed?
maybe .
``when jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene , he rebuked the evil spirit . ```you deaf and mute spirit, ` he said . `l command you to come out of him . ```
again , sorry about your friend .
thanks .
so when did you stop worshipping satan?
ten years ago . l`m a christian now .
lt`s more forgiving .
why`d you even start?
money .
power .
me?
i wanted to get laid .
there`s more pussy at a black mass than there is at a metallica concert .
what happens at a black mass?
people get naked .
then they sacrifice something .
a cat or a dog .
satan rewards you for killing a dog?
the more you give , the more you get .
what happens if you kill a human?
my group was more bankers and housewives ...
looking for a different kind of picnic .
do you know any people that are more devoted?
you don`t cross people who are willing to give up their souls .
walt , please .
yeah , i know a guy .
just do me a favor .
don`t tell him i sent you .
coming .
sammy .
mr. reisz , l`m jake gray .
i called about an hour ago , said i was coming by .
yeah .
i get $50 an hour for consultations .
right .
i should charge more .
the guy who fixes my car gets $80 .
barely knows where the sparkplugs are , much less how to conjure up beelzebub .
i ever sell books to you before?
no .
you say it`s called the ``pathway``?
yes .
why?
because that`s what we call the connection between the devil and the possessed .
so how did i resist?
we`re often unaware of our strength until we`re tested .
why does the devil need to use computers or games?
think about it .
lt`s a very effective way to spread a message .
i mean , imagine if hitler had had the lnternet .
maybe satan`s found someone to do his bidding again .
l`ve seen this man ...
in my head .
so have l .
what makes you think this guy can conjure satan?
because i taught him to .
when aidan kater came to me to learn the black arts ... he was a geek living out of the back of his van .
i stopped teaching a few years later ... but by then he was very skilled .
why did you stop?
i was going to be a father .
was?
anne kilton was a student of mine before we were married .
the pregnancy was hard on her .
she had a bad premonition ... and asked me to perform a sacrifice for the health of the baby .
a human sacrifice .
i refused .
so kater took your place .
i came home one night and found a pentagram in my yard .
there was blood everywhere .
i thought at first : ``anne must have sacrificed some kind of animal here . ``
but anne was gone , too .
when they found her bloody clothes in a ditch two days later , i knew ...
aidan kater had sacrificed my wife and unborn child .
l`m sorry .
what did the police say?
the police were very helpful .
they made me their prime suspect .
i spent the next five years trying to prove that i didn`t do it .
and that`s what i have left to remember them by .
an empty grave .
the devil uses the pathway to possess people .
and then forces them to kill ... and commit suicide?
she seduces them .
the devil`s a woman?
i don`t know .
it can be whatever it needs to be .
or what you want it to be?
i didn`t want it to be a woman .
you think conrad and dakota wanted to die like that?
some part of them did .
you didn`t even know them !
l`m not saying it`s your fault .
i think that you`re angry because
yes , l`m angry .
my friends are dead ! l`m angry !
but l`m not crazy .
this kater guy is behind this ... and i gotta do something .
i can`t just stand here .
what are you gonna do?
throw holy water on him?
burn him at the stake?
you believed me when i said i saw something .
i did .
i believed that you had a vision , maybe , or an apparition .
the bitch was in my basement !
okay .
you know what?
this is getting a little bit too heavy for me right now .
i adore you , but this is getting to be too much .
i guess i shouldn`t have come here .
l`m sorry .
fucking shit .
we`re not going to be able to save you now .
you are dust , and to dust you shaii return .
he`s gone to hell .
where you going with those , jake?
to your mother and father?
you can`t do that , man .
you`il ruin everything .
jake .
i didn`t have a choice .
neither of us do .
are we in hell?
no .
but hell ain`t so bad .
you`il see .
you know , you remind me of myself when i was your age .
smart .
angry .
trying desperately to pretend that i was something good ... but somehow deep down inside knowing you`re not .
l`m nothing like you .
i don`t kill people .
no , you just dream about it .
ls this how you got to conrad and dakota?
you mess with their minds until they do what you tell them?
it was a test .
they failed .
you passed .
you stared the devil directly in the face ... and you never looked away .
but when you finally did ... we knew that we`d found you .
you used the pathway to find me?
why?
because you were stolen from us ... and we needed a way to get you back .
stolen?
by who?
those people you call your parents .
they found your mother where she was hiding on the night you were born .
she was too weak to fight them .
you`re insane .
you were taken from your real mother on the night you were born .
my real mother?
anne kilton .
bullshit .
anne never had a child .
you made sure of that .
every son wants to believe his father ... but faking anne`s death kept lvan from the truth .
you belong to us .
you always have .
anne had a plan ... but when paul and kathy interfered ... you went from being a prince of darkness ... to just another fucked up kid .
look .
your whole life is a lie .
why are you doing this to me?
why?
don`t be afraid .
she`il explain everything .
where is she?
i know who you are now .
why?
no !
there`s a higher power looking out for you .
i had to make sure my son still belonged to me .
oh , god .
you had to kill before i could show myself to you .
they took you from me ... but l`m sorry i had to do this to you .
that isn`t your blood .
drink this .
accept who you were born to be ... or go back to the life that you hate .
will you be with me?
l`il be whatever you need me to be .
you`re a monster .
my god , they think i kiiled them?
the devii couldn`t kiii her child , so this is how she makes me pay ... for wanting to be human .
but maybe they`re right .
maybe there is no pathway .
and this is aii a fantasy i`ve created to iive with the horrible things i`d done .
wake me from this nightmare .
please .
help me .
