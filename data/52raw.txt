a beginning is a very delicate time .
know then , that it is the year 10, 191 .
the known universe is ruled by the padishah emperor shaddam the fourth , my father .
in this time , the most precious substance in the universe ... is the spice , melange .
the spice extends life .
the spice expands consciousness .
the spice is vital to space travel .
the spacing guild and its navigators , who the spice has mutated over 4, 000 years , use the orange spice gas , which gives them the ability to fold space .
that is , travel to any part of the universe ... without moving .
oh , yes .
i forgot to tell you .
the spice exists on only one planet in the entire universe .
a desolate , dry planet with vast deserts .
hidden away within the rocks of these deserts are a people known as the fremen , who have long held a prophecy ... that a man would come , a messiah , who would lead them to true freedom .
the planet is arrakis , also known as dune .
a secret report within the guild .
four planets have come to our attention ... regarding a plot which could jeopardize spice production .
planet arrakis , source of the spice .
planet caladan , home of house atreides .
planet giedi prime , home of house harkonnen .
planet kaitain , home of the emperor of the known universe .
send a third stage guild navigator to kaitain ... to demand details from the emperor .
the spice must flow .
father , irulan , you must leave .
a third stage guild navigator ... will be here within minutes .
we felt his presence .
i shall want telepathy during his visit ... and a report when we're finished .
i am your truthsayer , my lord .
he's here , my lord .
the bene gesserit witch must leave .
leave us .
yes , my lord .
we are alone .
we have just folded space from lx .
yes?
how was your journey?
many machines on lx .
new machines .
oh?
yes .
better than those on richese .
you are transparent .
i see many things .
i see plans within plans .
i see two great houses ,
house atreides , house harkonnen , feuding .
i see you behind it .
yes .
you must share with us .
the atreides house is building a secret army ... using a technique unknown to us .
a technique involving sound .
the duke is becoming more popular in the landsraad .
he could threaten me .
i have ordered house atreides to occupy arrakis to mine the spice , thus replacing their enemies , the harkonnens .
house atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain .
then , at an appointed time ,
baron harkonnen will return to arrakis ... and launch a sneak attack on house atreides .
i have promised the baron five legions of my sardaukar terror troops .
so the harkonnens will rid you of house atreides .
yes !
one small point .
here it comes .
we ourselves perceive a slight problem ... within house atreides .
paul .
paul atreides .
you mean , of course , duke leto atreides , his father .
i mean paul atreides .
we want him killed .
i did not say this .
i am not here .
i understand .
why would they want the duke's son killed?
we must have a look at paul atreides , on caladan .
the powerful bene gesserit sisterhood for 90 generations ... has been manipulating bloodlines ... to produce the kwisatz haderach , a super being .
on caladan , jessica , a member of the sisterhood ... and the bound concubine of duke leto atreides , had been ordered to bear only daughters .
because of her love for the duke ... she disobeyed and gave birth to a son
paul paul atreides .
here we are now , caladan .
and 19 light years beyond , beyond bene tleilax .
the training planet of the mentats , the human computers .
know a mentat by his red stained lips .
there .
arrakis .
spice mining .
carryalls lower the harvester to the sand ... and lift it off to safety when a worm attacks .
worms attack all rhythmic vibrations .
weather .
see storms .
no precipitation .
never one drop of rain on arrakis .
and the harkonnens are near .
there .
giedi prime and the baron harkonnen .
the enemy .
the baron harkonnen has sworn to destroy house atreides ... and steal the ducal signet ring for himself .
i know , thufir .
i'm sitting with my back to the door .
i heard you , dr. yueh , and gurney coming down the hall .
those sounds could be imitated !
i'd know the difference .
yes , perhaps you would at that .
my father sent you to test me .
music , then?
no music .
i'm packing this for the crossing .
shield practice .
gurney , we had practice this morning .
i'm not in the mood .
not in the mood !
mood's a thing for cattle and love play , not fighting !
i'm sorry , gurney .
not sorry enough .
what's wrong with gurney?
he's not faking this .
now , guard yourself for true !
is this what you seek?
good .
the slow blade penetrates the shield .
but , uh , look down .
we'd have joined each other in death .
you did seem finally to get the mood .
would you really have drawn my blood?
if you'd have fought one whit below your abilities ,
i'd have given you a good scar to remind you .
things have been so serious here lately .
soon we leave for arrakis .
arrakis is real .
the harkonnens are real .
dr. yueh , do you have any information on the worms of arrakis?
i have obtained a filmbook of a small specimen .
only 125 meters long .
only?
there have been documented sightings ... of worms as large as 450 meters in the deep desert .
that's far from where we'll be in arrakeen .
the desert belt and the south polar region are marked forbidden .
how do the fremen survive there?
we don't know much about the fremen .
they live in the deep desert , some in the cities .
they have blue within blue eyes .
oh , the eyes .
yes .
the saturation of the blood by the spice , melange .
could the spice affect us in other ways?
many dangers exist on arrakis .
for one , the harkonnens would not have given up ... their choam company contract so easily .
the harkonnens are our enemies , yes .
but behind them , i suspect , is the emperor .
you'll make a formidable duke .
now remember , the first step in avoiding a trap ... is knowing of its existence .
i know .
but if it is a trap , then why are we going?
we have our new army .
dr. yueh , put the weirding module on him .
well .
clear and lock the room !
detachment , stand down .
activate a fighter .
make the range two meters .
precise control .
duncan !
paul .
i was just on my way to say good bye to you .
i have to go on ahead .
i won't be seeing you for a while .
i wish you were coming with us .
why?
something for your father .
he wants to talk to you .
i'll see you on arrakis .
may the hand of god be with you .
may the hand of god be with us all , duncan .
father .
thank you for joining me , paul .
thufir hawat has served house atreides three generations .
he swears you are the finest student he has ever taught .
yueh , gurney and duncan say the same .
makes me feel very proud .
i want you to be proud of me .
i'll miss the sea .
but a person needs new experiences .
they jar something deep inside , allowing him to grow .
without change , something sleeps inside us ... and seldom awakens .
the sleeper must awaken .
arrakis .
dune desert planet
i will kill you .
the second moon .
tell me of your home world , usul .
i know she has come to test him .
no man has ever been tested with the box .
tonight , i may lose my son .
jessica , you were told to bear only daughters to the atreides .
jessica !
it meant so much to him .
you thought only of a duke's desire for a son?
desires don't come into this .
an atreides daughter could have been wed ... to a harkonnen heir and sealed the breach .
we may lose both bloodlines now .
i vowed never to regret my decision .
i'll pay for all my own mistakes .
and your son will pay with you .
arrakis ...
dune ...
desert planet .
moving .
moving .
we'll salvage what we can .
but i can tell you , dear god
for the father , nothing .
for the father , nothing?
did you really think you could bear the kwisatz haderach?
the universe's super being?
how dare you?
my greatest student .
and my greatest disappointment .
he's awake .
he's listening to us .
good .
ready yourself , young paul atreides .
i want to see you in your mother's chambers in one quarter of an hour .
paul , this is very important .
kwisatz haderach .
the super being .
for the father , nothing .
vas .
this is the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam .
she's going to observe you .
please .
jessica , you know it must be done .
your reverence .
what does she fear?
what about my father?
paul .
listen to the reverend mother and do what she tells you .
now you ... come here !
she's using the voice .
no .
some strength there .
surprising .
come here !
do you see this?
put your right hand in the box .
what's in the box?
pain .
stop !
put your hand in the box .
i hold at your neck the gom jabbar .
this one kills only animals .
are you suggesting a duke's son is an animal?
let us say i suggest you may be human .
your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts .
your instinct will be to remove your hand from the box .
if you do so , you die .
you will feel ... an itching .
there .
now the itching becomes ... burning .
heat upon heat .
upon heat !
it burns .
silence !
silence !
i must not fear .
fear is the mind killer .
fear is the little death that brings total obliteration .
i will face my fear .
i will permit it to pass over me and through me .
i must not fear .
you feel the flesh crisping? ... is the little death that brings total obliteration .
flesh ... dropping off .
fear is the little ... death !
i must not fear .
fear is the little death .
i'm
the pain !
no !
enough .
kull wahad .
no woman child ever withstood that much .
take your hand out of the box and look at it , young human .
do it !
pain by nerve induction .
a human can resist any pain .
our test is crisis and observation .
i see the truth of it .
could he be the one?
maybe .
but will he be ours to control?
tell me of your home world , usul .
do you know of the water of life?
the bile from the newborn worms of arrakis?
i have heard of it .
it is very dangerous .
the bene gesserit sisterhood use it to see within .
there is a place terrifying to us , to women .
it is said a man will come , the kwisatz haderach .
he will go where we cannot .
many men have tried .
they tried and failed?
they tried and died .
jessica .
my son lives .
i sense your teachings in him .
ignore the regular order of training .
his safety requires the voice .
i've heard enough of my safety .
what about my father?
i heard your talking .
you speak as if he were dead .
well , he's not .
and he won't die .
tell me he won't die .
what can be done has been done .
mother , tell me .
message for mentat piter de vries .
the baron is impatient for leto's reply .
it is by will alone i set my mind in motion .
it is by the juice of sapho that thoughts acquire speed , the lips acquire stains , the stains become a warning .
it is by will alone i set my mind in motion .
it is by will alone i set my mind in motion .
it is by the juice of sapho that thoughts acquire speed , the lips acquire stains , the stains become a warning .
it is by will alone i set my mind in motion .
my lord .
piter .
the atreides will be leaving caladan soon , baron , and i have here your answer from duke leto .
what does leto say , piter?
he wishes to inform you that " vendetta , " as he puts it , using the ancient tongue , the art of kanly , is still alive .
he does not wish to meet or speak with you .
i've made my peace gesture .
the forms of kanly have been obeyed !
bring in feyd and rabban .
as you instructed me ,
i have enlightened your nephews concerning my plan
my plan !
the plan ... to crush the atreides .
feyd .
rabban .
go quietly .
no other great house of the landsraad ... must ever know of the emperor's aid to the baron .
the entire landsraad would turn against the baron ... and the emperor .
put the pick in there , pete , and turn it 'round real neat .
ahhh .
you are so beautiful , my baron .
your skin , love to me .
your diseases , lovingly cared for ... for all eternity .
i will have arrakis back for myself .
he who controls the spice controls the universe !
and what piter did not tell you ... is we have control of someone who is very close , very close to duke leto .
this person , this traitor , will be worth more to us than ten legions of sardaukar !
and who is this traitor?
i won't tell you who the traitor is ... or when we'll attack .
however , the duke will die before these eyes , and he'll know , he'll know that it is i ,
baron vladimir harkonnen , who encompasses his doom !
ha , ha !
ha , ha !
this is what i'll do to the duke and his family .
oh , i'll miss caladan so much .
caladan .
soon they will begin to fold space .
far off in the control rooms of spice gas ... traveling ... without moving .
and now , the prophecy .
one will come .
the voice from the outer world , bringing the holy war , the jihad , which will cleanse the universe ... and bring us out of darkness .
house atreides took control of arrakis 63 standard days ... into the year 10, 191 .
it was known that the harkonnens , the former rulers of arrakis , would leave many suicide troops behind .
atreides patrols were doubled .
duncan .
what have you discovered about the fremen , duncan?
tell me .
why haven't we heard from you?
my lord , i suspect so much .
i think they are the allies we seek .
they are strong , fierce .
they do not give their loyalty easily or quickly .
as you know , the lmperium has never been able to take a census of the fremen .
everyone thinks that there are but few wandering here and there in the desert .
my lord ,
i suspect an incredible secret has been kept on this planet , that the fremen exist in vast numbers vast and it is they who control arrakis .
each trooper will be charged with responsibility ... for preserving water .
our existence as an operating army ... depends on these following water saving procedures .
remember , water is life .
why is the shield not yet up?
sir , we found and removed another sabotage device .
i think it'll go up now , sir .
... armed forces prospects for rehabilitation are good .
we're finding these sabotage devices too easily .
house shield activating .
duke leto is now here .
spice mining inspection to start immediately .
so you are dr. kynes , the judge of the change .
and the lmperial ecologist , sire .
our intelligence informs us ... that there's still a strong harkonnen presence .
the process of removal continues .
this is my son , paul .
are you a fremen?
i've been on arrakis ... in the service of the emperor long enough for my eyes to change .
ln the service of the emperor .
we are in your hands , doctor .
your gift of the stillsuits is much appreciated .
will you give us an explanation of their workings?
well , this is a stillsuit of fremen manufacture , the most efficient type on arrakis .
basically  [ growling ]
it's all right , gurney .
yes , sire .
basically , it's a high efficiency filter and heat exchange system .
perspiration passes through the first layer , and is gathered in the second , where salt is separated .
breathing and walking provide the pumping action .
the reclaimed water circulates to catch pockets ... from which you can drink through this tube ... at your neck .
urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads .
should you be in the open desert , remember to breathe in through your mouth ... and out through this nose tube .
with a fremen suit in good working condition ,
iife can be sustained for weeks , even in the deep desert , sire .
my thanks .
with your permission .
you've worn a stillsuit before .
no .
your suit is fitted desert fashion .
who told you how to do that?
no one .
it seemed the proper way .
that it is .
he shall know your ways as if born to them .
we're wasting time , sire .
battle language?
translate it .
very faint .
harkonnen !
airspeed : zero five .
300 degrees kelvin .
airspeed : three zero .
... 75 %%% efficiency .
that's where i told your sandmaster to concentrate the harvesting today .
southeast , over the shield wall .
350 degrees kelvin .
airspeed : one three zero .
you've now cleared protective shield wall ... and entered open desert .
will we see a worm?
where there's spice and spice mining , there are always worms .
always .
always .
why do they come?
to protect their territory .
vibrations attract them .
he must be a fremen , or in with them .
he's studying us .
he's hiding something about the spice .
is there a relationship between the worms and the spice?
as i said , they defend the spice sand .
as to their relationship with the spice , who knows?
my message .
it's here .
there are more enemy bodies coming in for your inspection , doctor yueh .
are you all right?
yes , i'm fine .
thank you , thufir .
dust cloud ahead , sire .
that's it .
spice mining .
no other cloud quite like it .
wormsign .
is it wormsign?
yes .
worm .
big one .
you've got sharp eyes .
may i?
calling harvester pad nine .
wormsign .
who calls pad nine?
don't mention the duke .
this is an uncoded channel .
unlisted flight northeast of you .
wormsign on intercept course .
15 minutes .
have sighting confirmed .
stand by for fix .
contact in 16 minutes minus .
very precise estimate .
who's on that unlisted flight?
what happens now?
the carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester .
try to get in close over the harvester .
you'll find this interesting , sire .
they'll work until the very last minute .
spotter control , there's no sign of the carryall .
it isn't answering .
the worm is eight minutes away , sire .
spotter control , give me a report by the numbers .
report one .
no contact .
report two .
negative .
report three .
negative , sir .
report four .
no contact .
i think they've got our carryall .
damn it .
harkonnens .
we are coming down to take you off the harvester .
all spotters are ordered to comply .
ordered by whom?
duke leto atreides .
yes .
yes , sire .
how many men do you have?
full crew , 26 men .
but , sire , we can't leave all this spice .
damn the spice !
get out of there !
two men in each of the spoilers !
you , over here !
run !
run !
i can't see him yet , but he's very close .
damn sloppy .
really damn sloppy .
come on , boys , come on !
we're going to be heavy , sire .
spice .
pure , unrefined spice .
here it is !
we've got to go !
bless the maker and his water .
bless the coming and going of him .
may his passing cleanse the world .
what's that you're saying?
nothing .
gods , what a monster !
someone is going to pay for this , i promise .
he's more concerned over his men than the spice .
i must admit , against all better judgment ,
i like this duke .
milady , the local people , the maids and servants , await your inspection .
hawat has cleared them .
excuse me , milady .
the harkonnens may have tampered with them medically .
when you said harkonnens ,
i didn't know you had so much reason to hate them .
my wife
but of course , you didn't know my wife .
the hark
forgive me .
they must have killed her .
please excuse me if i can't talk about it .
he's holding something back .
yet
there's the lmperial conditioning .
assurance of trust .
the bene gesserit mother .
the legend .
where is your son?
i must warn you , you are in great danger .
safe .
spice .
what is it doing to me?
second moon .
the sleeper must awaken .
am i the one?
a hunter seeker .
can't get me if i don't move .
it's too dark in here for it to see clearly .
i've got to try to grab it .
suspensor field will make it slippery on the bottom .
i must grip it tightly .
who is operating that thing?
it has to be someone in the palace .
i could shout for help , but it would kill whoever opened the door .
hold still .
it would have killed me .
i was its target .
it went to the motion .
who are you?
i am the shadout mapes , the housekeeper .
i must cleanse the way between us .
you saved my life , and we fremen pay our debts .
a fremen .
it is known to us that you've a traitor in your midst .
who it is , we cannot say .
but we are certain of it .
a traitor .
let's go , guys !
set up a sonar probe immediately .
over here !
harkonnen .
they have tried to take the life of my son .
sector six through 80 , progress reports , sire .
take it , thufir .
sector six , 80 , copy the sixth , the sum of the eighth , the quadrant over the ninth , plus 80 , four circles , weave the 80 and call the fourth .
copy .
eight , thufir hawat , mentat , master of assassins .
the , uh , the palace is now secure .
the city of arrakeen is under martial law .
we have troops here , headquartered underground , on subfloors six through ten .
the rest of the troops are stationed in arrakeen , and we have some on the airfield .
our new army is still in training , but everything , everything is shielded , and with this shielding , we are impenetrable .
sleep well , my son .
father ... drugged .
jessica , what is wrong?
forgive me , my beloved concubine .
i should have married you .
why hold a dream to ascend to a throne through a political marriage?
i should have married you .
what happened?
yueh !
he sabotaged the house generators .
we are wide open !
house shield deactivating .
i've destroyed the new army's weirding modules .
i've brought house atreides down .
why?
i wish to kill a man .
not you , my dear duke .
you were already dead .
but you'll get close to the baron before you die .
you'll be tied and drugged , but you can still attack .
you can still attack !
when you see the baron , you'll have a new poison gas tooth .
he'll want you close so he can gloat over you .
one bite on this tooth , and a strong exhale
refuse .
no , you mustn't !
because , in return , i'll save the lives of your paul and jessica .
for paul .
oh !
when you see the baron , remember the tooth .
the tooth .
the tooth !
the shield is down !
the shield is down !
open the doors !
signals !
get that shield up !
the shield !
the shield !
the weirding modules .
destroyed !
long live duke leto !
the drug was timed .
dr. yueh has been very valuable to us .
what a pity you must remain gagged .
we can't let ourselves be swayed by your witch's voice now , can we?
leto , where are you?
how simple to subdue us .
good bye , jessica .
and good bye to your sweet son .
i want to spit once on your head .
just some spittle in your face .
what a luxury .
we were ordered to kill them , so kill them .
i wish this was paul .
i knew yueh's wife .
i was the one who broke his lmperial conditioning .
i've thought of many pleasures with you .
it is perhaps better that you die in the innards of a worm .
what are your orders , piter?
take them to the desert as the traitor suggested .
the worms will destroy the evidence .
their bodies must never be found .
they're down on this floor somewhere .
down there .
duncan !
yaaah !
yaaaah !
you wish now to join your wife?
ls that it , traitor?
she lives?
you wish to join her?
join her .
you think you've defeated me?
you think i don't know what i gained ... for my wife?
take him away .
yueh's sign .
he's left us stillsuits .
don't touch my mother !
he's trying the voice .
the reverend mother said it could save him .
did you hear a noise from the little one?
huh?
i didn't hear anything .
the little one .
remove her gag .
excellent .
remove her gag .
remove her gag .
there's no need to fight over me .
there's no need to fight
a poisoned blade .
first ... cut my son's bonds .
that's it .
oh , my god !
it's under control .
duke leto atreides .
where is the ducal signet ring?
i must have his ring .
the ring !
he was brought to us as is , my lord baron .
you killed the doctor too soon , you fool !
the doctor , yueh .
what did he say?
paul and jessica safe .
yes !
the tooth !
he's coming around , baron .
where's your ring?
huh?
you do not answer?
wait .
wait .
you must come closer .
the water ... of my life ... for paul .
he's crying .
he's crying !
what does that mean , piter?
come closer , baron .
jessica !
paul !
leto !
leto , he's dead !
oh , he's dead !
i know .
am i alive?
i'm alive?
yes .
you're alive , my baron .
i'm alive , eh?
i'm alive !
i am alive !
i'm alive !
i can't maintain any altitude .
we'll never reach the safety of rock .
maybe that small rock .
where are we , do you think?
the south polar regions .
the forbidden area .
hold on .
hurry !
take the stillsuits .
hurry !
this crash might bring a worm .
the signet .
a million deaths are not enough for yueh .
where are my feelings?
i feel for no one .
the second moon .
i mean paul atreides .
we want him killed .
why?
why do they want me killed?
it has to be something to do with the spice .
but what?
he who controls the spice controls the universe !
this moon holds my future .
never one drop of rain on arrakis .
the sleeper must awaken .
they will call me muad'dib .
listen to me .
listen .
you wanted to know about my dreams .
well , i've just had a waking dream .
do you know why?
the spice !
it's in everything here .
calm yourself .
like the truthsayer drug .
it's a poison .
you knew the spice would change me .
but thanks to your teachings , it's changing my consciousness .
i see it !
i can see it !
ls he the one?
you carry my unborn sister in your womb .
he knows .
father !
father , i promise one day the sleeper will awaken , and i will avenge your death .
i will not stop until i destroy the emperor and the baron .
father .
go now .
take him to his desert ... to die .
go .
yueh's left the plan for the weirding modules .
we have to get to that mountain of rock .
we have entered the time when all will turn against us and seek our lives .
it's further than i thought .
a worm is sure to come .
i'll plant this thumper .
that should divert it .
remember , walk without rhythm , and we won't attract a worm .
it will go to the thumper .
i'm ready .
faster !
it's deafening !
the spice .
do you smell it?
yes !
paul !
paul !
a thumper .
the worm !
spice !
ls there a relationship?
what's happened?
why did it leave?
someone started another thumper .
we're not alone .
man carved steps .
yes .
such stealth .
i didn't hear them .
perhaps these are the ones the shadout mapes told us of .
i will take the boy man .
he shall have sanctuary in my tribe .
stop !
get back !
she has the weirding way .
great gods !
if you can do this to the strongest of us , you're worth ten times your weight of water .
as the leader of my people , i give you my bond .
teach us this weirding way , and you both shall have sanctuary .
your water shall mingle with our water .
then i will teach you our way of battle .
i give you the word bond of a bene gesserit .
it is the legend .
i am chani , daughter of liet .
i would not have permitted you to harm my tribe .
from my dreams .
so beautiful .
come with me .
i'll show you an easier way down .
you have strength .
you shall be known as usul , which is the strength of the base of the pillar .
this is your secret name in our troop , but you must choose the name of manhood ... which we will call you openly .
what do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
we call that one muad'dib .
could i be known as paul muad'dib?
you are paul muad'dib .
and your mother shall be a sayyadina among us .
we welcome you .
a dream unfolds .
moisture !
wind traps .
huge ones .
water .
millions of decaliters .
a treasure .
greater than treasure , usul .
we have thousands of such caches , and only a few of us know them all .
and when we have enough , we shall change the face of arrakis .
tell me of your home world , usul .
tell me of your home world , usul .
rabban !
rabban !
we're knee deep in atreides blood .
we've gutted them !
we've gutted them !
rabban .
rabban !
i place you in charge of arrakis .
it's yours to squeeze as i promised .
i want you to squeeze and squeeze and squeeze !
give me spice !
drive them !
drive them into utter submission !
do not show the slightest pity or mercy !
never stop !
go !
go !
show no mercy !
yes , baron .
feyd .
and when we've crushed these people enough ,
i'll send you , feyd .
lovely feyd .
where's my doctor?
jessica ... our reverend mother is too old .
she has been calling through space and time ... for you to come and let her rest .
she asks that you pass within and become our reverend mother .
if you be a reverend mother ...
iet shai halud judge now !
the water of life .
but what of my unborn child?
one day , i will have to do this .
following the bene gesserit tradition , the old reverend mother surrendered her life ... as she surrendered her knowledge .
jessica had successfully transmuted the poisonous water of life .
every man who has tried has died .
am i the one?
the sleeper must awaken .
the tremendous power of the water of life ... caused the premature birth of jessica's daughter , alia .
alia was born with all the knowledge and powers of a reverend mother .
feyd , even though he's aging ,
thufir's one of the finest mentats in the universe .
and he's mine , feyd , all mine .
try it now .
i will .
come .
oh , thufir !
i see they've installed your heart plug already .
don't be angry .
everyone gets one here .
but this is not why we're here .
we brought you a little cat , thufir .
you must care for it if you wish to live .
a poison has been introduced into your body , thufir hawat .
by milking this , this smooth little cat's body , you receive your antidote .
it must be done each day .
all i can see ... is an atreides that i want to kill .
feyd !
no , no !
thufir's a harkonnen now .
aren't you , thufir?
my duke !
how i've failed you .
chani , i love you .
i've always loved you .
the holy warriors .
no one ever dreamed there were so many .
i am usul .
paul muad'dib .
our shared enemy , the harkonnens , are once again in control of arrakis .
stilgar , your leader , has asked me and my mother ... to teach you the weirding way to crush the harkonnens .
we must do more than this .
we must totally destroy all spice production on arrakis .
the guild and the entire universe depends on spice .
he who can destroy a thing controls a thing .
i will take 100 of your warriors and train them .
this 100 will train the thousands that remain .
when the spice flow stops , all eyes will turn to arrakis .
the baron and the emperor himself ... will be forced to deal with us .
arrakis will become the center of the universe .
orato !
this obelisk is of your hardest stone .
kick it .
hit it .
yell at it .
break !
korba ... cut it .
move back .
cha a a a ... a aksa !
muad'dib !
this is part of the weirding way that we will teach you .
some thoughts have a certain sound , that being the equivalent to a form .
through sound and motion ... you will be able to paralyze nerves , shatter bones , set fires , suffocate an enemy or burst his organs .
we will kill until no harkonnen breathes arrakeen air .
muad'dib !
cha a a a aksa !
stilgar !
muad'dib !
hmm?
muad'dib .
muad'dib .
muad'dib .
my name is a killing word .
they are ready to fight .
yet in order to lead them , i must conquer the worm .
conquer shai halud .
conquer shai halud .
take the kiswa maker hook of our sietch ... and ride as a leader of men .
mmmmmm .
shai halud .
i must not fear .
fear is the mind killer .
only the very strong ones travel this deep .
usul has called a big one !
again , it is the legend .
look !
muad'dib !
usul , these are 15 of our finest warriors ... to serve you as your guard .
the fedaykin .
cha aksa !
ooh !
now .
cha a aksa !
cha aksa !
cha aksa !
cha aksa !
cha aksa !
aaaah !
cha aksa !
when the spice flow stops , all eyes will turn to arrakis .
the baron and the emperor himself will be forced to deal with us .
muad'dib .
muad'dib .
muad'dib .
muad'dib .
what happened?
what happened to you and your men?
muad'dib .
muad'dib .
what are you saying?
muad'dib .
muad'dib .
muad'dib .
what?
he's been repeating that name ever since we found him .
who is this ...
muad'dib?
cha aksa !
ln the two standard years that followed ,
muad'dib and the fremen brought spice production to a standstill .
fearing for his life , rabban did his best ... to hide this fact from his uncle , the baron .
paul's sister , alia , matured at a frightening rate .
her small body harbored tremendous powers .
paul and chani's love grew .
we surprised a band of smugglers .
too bad .
i thought they were harkonnen .
cha aksa !
cha a aksa !
gurney !
you've no need of your weapons with me , gurney halleck .
paul?
paul?
don't you trust your own eyes?
they said you were dead .
they ... they said
gurney !
gurney man !
you young pup !
you young pup !
gurney !
emperor shaddam the fourth , you have one last chance to take matters into your own hands ... and bring the situation under control on arrakis .
what do you mean one last  silence !
do not speak !
listen !
you do not have more than this one chance .
i represent the entire guild in this matter .
our navigators warn you that spice production is in great danger .
a new fremen leader , muad'dib , has stopped spice mining on arrakis .
our navigators suggest he is not of arrakis .
no one on the outside world has been able to see him .
we do not know who he is .
the harkonnens cannot stop him .
remedy the situation , restore spice production , or you'll live out your life in a pain amplifier .
the emperor will stop him .
he won't take the water of life .
that's why they want me killed .
they're afraid i'll take the water of life .
i want 50 legions of sardaukar on arrakis at once !
fifty legions?
that's our entire reserves as well .
this is genocide : the deliberate and systematic destruction ... of all life on arrakis !
the emperor is coming .
chani !
chani !
you were calling my name .
it frightened me .
oh , chani .
all the images of my future are gone .
i have to drink the water of life .
no .
paul .
please .
i've seen the men who have tried .
i've seen how they died .
i'm dead to everyone unless i try ... to become what i may be .
only the water of life will free what can save us .
paul .
i must drink the sacred water .
we must go now .
hurry .
all i see is darkness .
paul ,
i will love you forever .
you are my life .
you are my life .
many men have tried .
they tried and failed?
they tried and died .
the worm is the spice .
the spice is the worm .
the worms .
they're not attacking .
why?
alia .
mother .
it's paul .
he's taken the water of life .
there is a place ... terrifying to us , to women .
this is the place they cannot look .
travelling without moving .
now i truly control the worm ... and the spice .
and i have the power to destroy the spice forever !
paul .
father !
father , the sleeper has awakened !
muad'dib .
muad'dib .
muad'dib .
muad'dib .
muad'dib .
muad'dib .
arrakis .
dune .
desert planet .
your time has come .
a storm is coming .
our storm .
and when it arrives it will shake the universe .
emperor , we come for you !
we come for you !
long live the fighters !
long live the fighters !
the emperor's had rabban seized .
gurney , when the storm hits , set off the atomics .
i want an opening through the entire shield wall .
stilgar , do we have wormsign?
usul , we have wormsign the likes of which even god has never seen .
bring in that floating fat man , the baron .
why have you brought me here?
your highness ... there must be some mistake .
i never requested your presence .
ah .
but your lack of action demanded it .
your dreadful mismanagement , your bad judgment ... in assigning to rabban the governorship .
you've forced me to come here and set things straight , personally !
i am a messenger from muad'dib .
poor emperor !
i'm afraid my brother won't be very pleased with you .
silence !
kill this child .
she's an abomination .
kill her !
get out of my mind !
not until you tell them both who i really am .
alia .
daughter of duke leto the just ... and the royal lady jessica .
sister of paul muad'dib .
paul's sister?
paul is muad'dib?
alia keeps pace with the storm .
with the storm , their air power will be useless .
on arrakis , it's desert power .
gurney , now !
atomics !
my brother is coming ... with many fremen warriors .
impossible !
not impossible !
i told you .
he is here now .
father , today i will avenge your death .
emperor , an impassable storm has descended .
the shield wall has been penetrated by atomics .
release the sardaukar !
baron , give this little abomination to the storm .
wait for my brother , baron .
cha aksa !
wait for my brother .
cha aksa !
cha aksa !
muad'dib !
cha aksa !
cha aksa !
cha aksa !
alia , now .
come to me , baron .
muad'dib .
feyd rautha .
emperor shaddam the fourth , there are guild heighliners above us ... containing many great houses of the landsraad .
send them back !
how dare you speak to me in that
stop your speaking !
you have some idea of what i could do .
don't try your powers on me .
try looking into that place where you dare not look .
you'll find me there staring back at you .
you mustn't speak  silence !
i remember your gom jabbar .
now you remember mine .
i can kill with a word .
aaaah !
aaaah !
and his word shall carry death eternal ... to those who stand against the righteous .
the righteous?
there is a harkonnen among you .
give the harkonnen a blade , and let him stand forth .
if feyd wishes , he can meet you with my blade in his hand .
i wish it .
this is a harkonnen animal .
let me .
please , my lord .
the emperor's blade .
why prolong the inevitable?
i will kill you !
i will kill him !
paul !
i will kill him !
who is the little one?
a pet , perhaps?
will she deserve my special attentions?
poisoned .
you see your death .
my blade will finish you .
i will bend like a reed in the wind .
aaaaah !
aaaaah !
cha aksa !
muad'dib !
usul no longer needs the weirding module .
muad'dib had become the hand of god , fulfilling the fremen prophecy .
where there was war , muad'dib would now bring peace .
where there was hatred , muad'dib would bring love , to lead the people to true freedom , and to change the face of arrakis .
we fremen have a saying .
god created arrakis to train the faithful .
one cannot go against the word of god .
and how can this be?
for he is the kwisatz haderach !
