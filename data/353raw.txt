your men are still not in position?

we got four minutes to load and leave .
let's go .
whoa !
whoa !
hey , you guys .
come here .
i want to propose a toast .
to us .
yay !
and i want to propose a toast to charlie because we just stole $35 million worth of gold without even holding a gun because he planned this down to a " t .
nobody else could have done that .
nobody .
charlie !
charlie !
yay !
thank you .
so , come on , gentlemen .
shopping list .
who's doing what?
spare no dirty details .
come on , you guys .
take a lesson from an old man .
don't spend it .
invest .
in what?
in gold .
let's figure out how to get out of here first , all right?
what are you getting , rob?
i don't know ... there's a lot of things you can buy with a lot of money .
you know , i'm just thinking about naked girls in leather seats .
obviously .
see?
suppose i get the aston martin vanquish?
there's not a lot a girl won't do on the passenger seat of one of those things .
i'm going to get a nad t770 digital decoder with a 70 watt amp and burr brown dacs .
yeah .
it's a big stereo .
speakers so loud they blow women's clothes off .
now you're talking .
$35 million ... you can't get more creative than that , man?
i'm going to andalucia , south of spain ... right there .
get me a big house ... get me a libraty full of first editions .
get a room for my shoes .
what about you , steve?
i don't know ... i haven't decided yet .
you haven't decided yet?
come on , man , is it the mountain air , just ...?
i liked what you said .
i'll take one of each of yours .
well , well , two of everything
for steve then .
two of those .
oy !
loved the toast .
but you could've pulled this off with your eyes closed .
no , you were incredible .
just incredible .
you saw the whole picture .
you covered all the angles .
the ones who steal to enrich their lives , and the ones who steal to define their lives .
don't be the latter .
makes you miss out on what's really important in this life .
what are you talking about , john?
you've been a good father .
sitting in prisons doesn't make you a good father .
i spent half my kid's life in prison .
don't get to be my age with nothing but this , charlie .
find somebody you want to spend the rest of your life with and hold onto her forever .
okay?
hey .
let's go ... i'm freezing my ass off .
yeah .
steve's getting cold .
you , too?
i'm all right .
i love you , kid .
you did really great .
thanks , john .
let's go .
money it's a gas grab that cash with both hands and make a stash new car , caviar , four star daydream ... you should've seen rob behind the wheel of that boat .
he was like don johnson .
oy , yeah , from brixton .
yeah , what the hell do you know about brixton , eh?
look at this idiot right in the middle of the road .
what's this , what's this?
who the hell are these guys?
hey !
take your hands off the wheel .
steve !
don't even think about it ... just do it .
no , no , no , no ,
no , no , no , no , john .
steve , what the hell are you doing?
made a few plans of my own .
there's nowhere you can go where we won't find you , steve .
you know that .
i think that's probably right , john .
go !
go !
charlie .
we got to go , charlie .
you always work in the dark?
makes me feel like i'm alone .
not bad .
not bad , stella .
damn .
hurley couldn't crack that safe .
neither could spears .
now you know who to call first .
you're expensive , stella .
those guys cut us a break on subpoena jobs .
good will , community service .
i do it for the money , paul .
i'll be sending you a bill .
don't you want to see what's inside?
i never look inside .
have a good day .
hey , george .
hi , stella .
i came , i saw , i kicked some ass the pain i cause , it makes me laugh
'cause the way i do my thing is strange time , time for this girl to sing damn if i thought that you would change and my life would stay the same things will come and things will go and one thing i know for sure is that the wreckoning , the wreckoning , the wreckoning i'm walking out the door wreckoning , the wreckoning , the wreckoning oh , it's time ...
how long to crack it?
four minutes and 43 seconds .
oh !
you're the man .
what's on the lineup?
todd milliken called .
he has a prototype combination lock .
he wants you to test out .
he says he added two false contact points on the tumbler .
i'll pretend to be stumped for a couple of seconds , give him a thrill .
and , there's a charlie croker in your office .
says you two know each other .
charlie croker .
hey , stella .
didn't i tell you i never want to see you again?
i think it was when you told me how my father died , right in front of your eyes , after you pulled him in for one last job .
we found him , stella .
he's in los angeles .
the gold bricks he stole from us had a balinese dancer stamped on them .
i just got word , from a contact of mine called skinny pete , that a gold dealer out in l . a .
has been buying those bricks .
yeah?
well , how do you know it's him?
skinny pete sent me this .
steve changed his last name to frazelli .
why you telling me all of this?
been checking out the databases behind safe companies .
found out steve had a worthington 1000 delivered to his home office .
you don't install a worthington 1000 unless you've got something really big to guard .
no , you don't .
the problem now is no one in my crew can handle steve's safe .
and i need somebody i can trust .
look , i'm a professional safe and vault technician .
i'm not a thief .
hey , it's not about the gold , stella , okay?
john was like a father to me , too .
look , i'm sorty , all right?
i just can't move on until i've set things right .
i've moved on .
come on , charlie .
come on .
hello?
i want to see the look on that man's face when his gold is gone .
he took my father from me ; i'm taking this .
she's in .
that's a good thing?
it's a vety good thing .
she can crack a worthington 1000 without even flinching .
i'm not sure having a civilian on the crew's a good idea , charlie .
she's got the skill and she's got the motivation .
exactly .
she's emotional .
you know what happens when emotion gets into it .
look , don't kid yourself , all right?
we're all emotional on this one .
let's go .
are you ready?
of course i am .
you're not ready .
that was quick .
where are they?
we're a little early .
i didn't expect us to get here quite that fast .
there .
that's lyle .
he's my computer genius .
you know , he's who really invented napster .
at least that's how lyle tells it .
said shawn fanning was his roommate in college and stole his idea .
think it's his first time riding that bike , though .
hey .
oh ... you okay?
yeah .
mm hmm .
that's left ear .
demolition and explosives .
when he was ten , he put one too many m 80s in the toilet bowl .
fire ... whoa .
yeah , that was cool .
how'd you do that?
what? !
how'd you do that?
what? !
i said , how did you do that?
what? !
lost the hearing in his right ear .
he's been blowing stuff up ever since .
handsome rob .
premier wheel man .
once drove all the way from los angeles just so he could set the record for longest freeway chase .
you're a heartbreaker ...
you know , he got 110
love letters sent to his jail cell from women who saw him on the news?
you're a heartbreaker dream maker
love taker don't you mess around , no , no , no ...
and you?
i never heard how you got your start .

well , i've been a thief since i had baby teeth .
okay , you both know what to do .

140 pounds?
tty 165 .
tty lifting some weights .
tty lifting up these .
guys , enough .
come on , we leave tomorrow , all right?
let's go .
hey , charlie ... handsome , can you help him with the bike?
yeah , help knievel set up for his next jump .
like a sound you hear that lingers in your ear but you can't forget , from sundown to sunset no , no it puts a brand new kind of thinkin 'in your mind and you can't go wrong
'cause you're groovin 'all day long , ha ha !
california soul ooh ooh ooh california soul ... man , out of all of the places for a thief to hide , this joker picked hollywood .
he's a punk , but he ain't stupid .
all right ... we need to figure out a way to get in steve's house and make a video blueprint of the interior .
i want audio surveillance on his phone .
oh , yeah , i been wanting to tty something .
i crack into the phone company's remote monitoring system , and fool it into thinking there's a legal tap on the line .
just reroute the digital copies of the calls to our own listening post .
i been doing it to my ex for years .
how long?
no ... how long will it take?
not how long have you been doing it to your ex .
i'll burn through the night ; i'll have it running by morning .
sorty i'm late .
we got to work on getting steve out of the house .
stella , how much time you need with the worthington?
five minutes flat .
don't be cocky , young lady .
it's not the same as opening a safe for the police .
the perspiration on your fingertips , your heart's pounding in your ears ... whole different ball game .
i appreciate your concern .
i'll be fine .
look , just remember , this is all the easy part , okay?
it's the getaway that can get us caught .
so what's the sketch?
we drive to union station .
getaway car goes right onto the train with us .
we need to know exactly how long it's going to take to get from steve's house to union station .
oh , great .
carson security system .
how good is it?
carson's held an annual contest ... $50, 000 to anybody that can bypass the system .
the who's who of ex cons always show up .
five years running , no one's been paid .
okay , party people , here's the status .
it's an anti scaling fence .
it's hardened , electro plated steel .
yeah , i'm going to have to paint that up with some nitromin .
security on the property?
got an armed guard here .
little rent a cop , with a nine millimeter on his hip .
but that booth ... security booth looks prime for a chemical grenade .
nitromin , chemical grenades ... i mean , that stuff's pretty hard to come by .
yeah , lyle , it's a bear market .
shit .
this dude got dogs .
i don't do dogs .
i had a ... real bad experience , man .
what happened?
i had a bad experience .
damn it .
i'm deaf .
you turn in your badge and your weap ... oh , shoot .
turn in your badge and your weapon !
crush .
i don't want to see you anywhere near this investigation .
and turn in your badge and your weapon .
i don't want to see you anywhere near this investigation .
hey !
it's a green !
turn in your badge and your weapon .
green !
i don't want to see you anywhere near this ... turn in your badge and your weapon .
unbelievable .
there he is .
let's get to work .
it's either bad traffic , peak traffic , slit your wrist traffic .
you know , five people died from smoking in between traffic lights today .
you know , they do have the metrorail , rob .
you could always use that .
that'd be ideal for cartying a ton of gold , wouldn't it , genius?
what's your guesstimate?
the last 20 times i've done the journey , you've got an average of 32 minutes and a top time of 50 , but if we had green lights all the way , we could do it in 14 minutes .
wait , you couldn't get through traffic?
whoa .
we could do anything with green lights all the way .
lyle?
lyle?
i'll see what i can do .
you're right on time .
all these poor bastards out there , putting their life savings in banks , and s& ls , and mutual funds .
how do they think , when the collapse comes , they can depend on the government?
i don't think so .
are you taping me?
of course not .
i never tape you ... come look , see for yourself .
governments are nothing more than puppets and strings in a world where nafta can overrule the supreme court .
like my cousin mashkov always says : " this is our only refuge , baby ... gold .
evety time i look at these engravings ... she's so beautiful .
where'd you say you got these?
i didn't .
a little walking around money .
i guess i'm not walking as far as i thought .
i'm ... sorty .
i can only buy two bricks from you today .
that wasn't the agreement .
what can i say?
i'm just middleman .
i'll buy the other two from you on wednesday .
don't waste my time , yevhen .
so , what does a man with 35 million dollars worth of gold do at night?
he watches his big ass tv .
that's our in .
stella .
jesus !
charlie !
how did you get in here?
i knocked , but you didn't answer .
what ... so you just let yourself in?
i was just making sure you were okay .
i apologize .
i just ... i ...
don't look .
okay .
you got a lot of stuff here .
you know , your dad was old school .
did the whole thing by touch .
that worked for him ; this works for me .
technology guarantees speed and accuracy , you know?
yeah , but there's no guarantees in this business , stella .
why the headphones?
just training myself .
ambient noises , you know , just in case .
what do you want , charlie?
we're going to knock out steve's cable , and we need to send in a repairman .
to get your video blueprint of the interior .
yep .
only problem is steve thinks we're all dead .
except me .
i'll do it , charlie .
i'm in all the way , whatever it takes .
all right .
i'll set it up .
okay .
um ... you , um ... maybe want to get a drink downstairs with me before i go back to my room?
i sh ... i should finish this stuff up , you know?
just get it all done tonight .
yeah .
sorty i scared you .
it's okay .
good night .
bye .
and then he's just ... the media darling .
he's on the cover of all the magazines .
i should've been on the cover of wired magazine .
you know what he said?
he said he ... he named it napster because it it was his nickname ,
'cause of the nappy hair under the hat , but he ... it's 'cause i was napping when he stole it from me !
he didn't even graduate .
i think it's time to move on , don't you?
they shut him down .
i wish they'd do the same to you .
here ... here we go .
cable chick .
becky .
nice name ... i wonder what she calls the other one .
and it's such a mystety why you don't have a girlfriend , lyle .
so , all we need is a ... service truck like that one , a work shirt like hers .
you think stella can pull it off?
i have my doubts .
there's no talking to charlie , though .
you think he's ... mixing business with pleasure?
he should know better .
only i'm allowed to do that .
right .
where you going?
to get a work shirt and a service truck .
are you kidding me?
how does he do that?
how do you do that?
what are you saying?
hey , how are you?
oh , good .
i'm good .
nice to meet you , i'm ... handsome rob .
and you are ...?
oh , my name's ... my name's becky , but it's written on my shirt .
listen , i'm going to need your shirt ... and your truck .
perfect .
i'll give them both to you .
would you ... would you like my virginity as well?
if it's on the menu .
ha , ha , ha , ha , oh , you're so witty .
why don't you take advantage of me?
yeah , you're not too bright , are you?
no .
perfect .
what can i do for you , mr .
frazelli?
the cable's out .
the tv , the modem , everything .
now , get somebody up here , and tell them to hurty up .
netcom cable , how can i help you?

okay , um , let's see , sir .
i have a thursday between 9 : 00 and 3 : 00 if that would be good .
that's going to work .

thursday between 9 : 00 and 3 : 00 .
hello?
hi , i'm calling from netcom cable .
i understand your service is out , and there was an appointment set up for thursday .
yes .
well , we have a technician working in your area who's finished with an appointment earlier than expected .
will somebody be there for the next hour?
sure , that'd be great .
all right , our technician will see you then .
have a nice day .
here's all the paperwork you need .
just get him to sign and date at the bottom .
let's check out the camera .
stella , you'll be going patriotic today .
make sure you walk slowly , or the image will streak .
ow .
ooh .
i'm sorty .
it's okay .
sorty ... couldn't pin the corsage on my prom date either .
but you had a prom date?
it was his cousin .
there's cable lines in the kitchen , living room , bedroom , and the cable modem on the computer in the office .
you need to locate the safe in the office .
okay .
just want you to know i think you're vety brave going in there .
i know it won't be easy .
i second that .
it's going to be fine .
what?
you know what fine stands for?
freaked out .
insecure ... neurotic , and emotional .
you'll be great .
yeah .
morning .
can i see some i . d .?
thanks for coming so soon .
hey , that's part of the job .
all right .
aston martin vanquish .

nasty ass dogs .
hey !
hey !
relax , jesus christ .
come on , they won't bother you now .
come on .

go on , get out of here .
it's okay , i'm used to running into all sorts of animals on my job .
steve frazelli .
becky .
want to show me that problem?
yeah , of course .
this way .
you have a really nice house .
yeah .
1922 .
all the original tiles .
evety stone in that courtyard hauled from some monastety in seville .
what a tactic .
monastety?
monastety for punk ass creeps .
you don't seem impressed .
no , it's just that i don't think lugging a bunch of rocks from one place to another is quite ... that interesting .
you know , it doesn't quite do it for me .
what does do it for you?
um ... tvs?
i have a monster tv .
not working right now , but ... but you know , i should probably check out the cable modem , you know .
yeah?
yeah , right .
over here .
i paid 30 grand to some punk kid to put this system in .
one day , it just goes out .
i ought to have him strung up .
here we go .
there's our baby .
we got him .
got any , uh , wiring coming through here?
there's no wiring in here .
just right here?
yeah .
look at that , that's my ... that's my nad t770 .
that's ... that's my stereo .
i bet most of your customers are pretty surprised when they go to open the door for the cable man and find you standing there .
oh , yeah .
he's hitting on her .
there's no problem here .
i should maybe just check the tvs .
okay .
you know what , end this shit right now .
i'm going to blow this shit right off the mountain right now .
no , no , no .
no , no , hey , hey , hey .
i see you got the avm processor .
only the best .
check the box .
i'm just going to ... reset your system .
sometimes these things just get jammed up you know?
that should do it .
it's fixed?
turn her on , let's see .
now .
japan's nikkei index ... perfect .
... was the ending price and as you can see , we've now gone below ... becky , huh?
have we met before? ... a loss of 1 . 1 percent on the ... no , i don't think so .
if you can just sign there .
so , if i was to ask you out to dinner ... would i be the first one of your customers to ever do that?
what , you asked your last cable repair guy out for a date?
no , but the last one was , like , 300 pounds , had a handlebar mustache .
you know , not really my type .
i don't think it's a good idea .
why , is that , like , some , cable company rule?
no , actually , it's just my rule .
i don't go out with strange men .
i just met you five minutes ago .
so , i guess i have to , like , sabotage my cable , you know , till we get to know each other well enough .
have a nice day .
come on , i'll be a perfect gentleman , i promise .
i won't even ask you for your phone number .
i'll just ... i'll meet you .
anywhere you want to go .
come on , break your rule once .
it's just dinner .
is that a yes?
are you okay?
yeah .
he touched my hand .
he came on to me .
hey , at least i ... i created a window of opportunity , right?
when he goes out friday night , we go in .
by the time he realizes you've stood him up , we'll be long gone with that gold .
yeah .
make sure you shuffle them cards this time , left .
hey , lyle , what's the distance between the front door and the vault?
don't deal when my back's turned .
you've got that loser's paranoia .
lyle !
he only answers to the napster now , charlie .
no .
i'm not calling you the napster .
why not , you call him left ear .
well , i am .
and him , handsome rob .
well , that's because he is handsome rob .
well , you can call me the napster .
come on , they were at the same college at the same time .
why are you encouraging this?
it is a verifiable fact ... he was my roommate , he stole my ideas .
i am the napster .
all right , all right .
what is the distance between the front door and the vault , napster?
it's farther than you want to carty it .
yeah , but , so , how do we get the gold from the vault to the getaway car?
how wide is the hallway ... napster?
six feet .
okay , you've got your gold .
whoo !
we need more cars to handle the weight .
looks like i'm going to need some help with the custom work , too .
i know a man for the job .
so i modified the camera to include the ... so we can create really hi res digital maps .
who's that?
rob's mechanic friend .
hey , charlie .

gas the guards , doors open 8 : 15 .
safe popped by 8 : 25 .
loaded by 8 : 35 , out the door by 8 : 45 .
straight to union station .
only green lights on your route .
the rest of the city's red .
cops are stuck in the traffic , like evetyone else .
train leaves at 10 : 00 .
cars have to be on the carrier by 9 : 30 .
timing's got to be dead on .
let's get ready .
let's get it .
wow , that is a nice car .
sorty , rob .
coast is clear , guys .
this is it , guys .
moment of truth .
what the hell is this?
shit !
steve's neighbor's throwing a party .
are you here for the , uh , baker party , sir?
no .
we're not blowing any gates tonight , guys .
too many witnesses .
stella .
i know , i know .
i'm late for my date .
yeah , and you got to be charming .
you'll need him to ask you out again .
sorty .
let's get out of the street .
i really can't imagine you doing that .
what's that supposed to mean?
well , you don't really seem
like the adventurous type , you know?
don't let the cable uniform , you know , throw you .
i wasn't making assumptions .
i've made some assumptions about you .
oh , really?
and?
well ... you're just going to have to wait and see .
why wait?
let's get a check .
let's go back to my place .
no assumptions ... not tonight .
it's late .
i should go home .
what , you have a cable company curfew?
no , but i've made some bad calls in the past .
hey .
we should take this maybe a little slower , you know?
this lovely dinner , sparkling conversation ... you still don't trust me?
oh , i trust evetyone .
it's the devil inside them i don't trust .
it's an interesting saying .
it's charming .
where'd you pick that up?
can't remember .
really?
i knew a guy who said it exactly like that .
really?
yeah .
he's the only person i've ever heard say that .
he said it all the time .
his name was john bridger .
you're hurting my wrist .
he had a daughter and she was about your age .
let go of my wrist .
i knew that there was something familiar about you .
you're exactly like your old man , you know that?
i liked him , too , right from the start .
i liked him right up until the minute i shot him .
who are you working with?
she's with us .
gang's all here .
you know , the only thing worse than a thief , bendel?
a coward .
then you should have seen the way your daddy begged for his life .
it's not worth it .
put a leash on your cat .
hi , steve .
charlie .
not bad , charlie .
really , not bad .
you have no idea how hard it is for me not to reach across this table and kill you with my bare hands .
you know better than that , charlie .
can't let emotion into these things .
tell me it wasn't about emotion when you shot john and left us all for dead .
that wasn't about emotion .
it was about a lot of gold , and i wanted it .
anything you think you deserved , you didn't .
hey , don't talk about right and wrong with me , man ,
'cause i just don't give a shit .
okay?
you got your cards , i got my cards , we made our play , and i came out on top , okay?
now if you want to start the game up again , that's fine with me .
but what , i mean , what is your play here , really?
i mean , come on , what do you ... what do you think?
y you'll tty to take out my guards , right?
i have five of them that you don't know about .
you'll tty to have lyle hack the system .
i'll change it again tomorrow morning .
what , what , what was y your final move?
i mean , you were going to have bridger's daughter come in and tty to crack my safe?
i mean , that's ... that's vety poetic and all , but i just don't see it .
i don't think she'll get anywhere near it .
same old steve , huh?
always thinking defensively .
that's why you're always number two .
how do you figure that?
you got no imagination .
couldn't even decide what to do with all that money .
you had to buy what evetybody else wanted .
oh ... well , tty this on in your imagination , okay?
that gold is already gone .
that's bullshit , steve .
no , really , it's over charlie .
i'm ttying to move the last two bricks .
you want to come after me over a couple of lousy bricks?
i mean , really , be my guest .
but you're off to a bad start , you know?
'cause you just blew the best thing you had going for you .
you just blew the element of surprise .
surprised?
it's over when i say it's over .
are you all right , sir?
how you doing?
good ... considering ... considering the fact that i'm doing all of this for a man i barely knew .
you know what bothered me all those years , charlie?
it was that , whenever he'd call me to tell me that he was on some job , i knew you were right there with him .
you got to know him a lot better than i did .
just 'cause he was around me more doesn't mean he wasn't thinking about you all the time .
be nice if it was true .
it is true .
he always regretted not having been a good enough father to you , stella .
how do you know that?
because he told me .
what did you do to your hand?
i punched steve .
why do you get to punch him and i don't?
those hands are way too valuable .
hey .
okay?
there'll be nothing left of that if you keep rubbing it .
tell mr .
frazelli we'll see him at 8 : 00 .
charlie !
he's flying the coop .
when?
his security guard called for a private helicopter at 4 : 00 pm .
there's an armored car service coming to his house at 5 : 00 .
there is a cargo plane scheduled to depart lax at 8 : 00 pm to mexico city .
what if he's moving the safe as a diversion?
we crack it , it's empty , the gold's somewhere else .
steve's not about to let that gold out of his sight .
it's going to be in that truck and he's going to be watching it evety step of the way from the helicopter .
so the gold's headed to mexico .
who knows where?
they could change the flight plan in midair .
slow down , slow down .
you guys are looking at this the wrong way .
this is good news for us .
charlie , what do you mean , " good news "?
we've been ttying to get to the gold in the safe , now the safe is coming to us .
we're going to boost it in transit .
charlie , it could take a dozen different routes to the airport .
we have no idea which one .
we can't take out an armored truck during rush hour .
we're already set up to do it .
napster , gridlock evety route except for the one we choose .
force that truck to go exactly where we want it to go .
where do we want it to go?
we can't have a shoot out with armed guards .
we'd lose .
we do it like the italian job .
hello?
why'd you do it?
do what?
yevhen .
you didn't have to clip him .
whoa , whoa .
what are you talking about?
we didn't clip anybody .
yevhen's cousin is under the distinct impression that you did .
why does he think that?
because you want to know about the gold with the balinese dancer .
you told him that?
listen to me , man .
if there's one thing that i know is never to mess with mother nature , mother in laws or mother freakin 'ukrainians .
look , i need a favor .
yeah .
had a hiccup last night .
could use some help .
want hands on this time .
you interested?
could be .
but i don't like to be kept in the dark .
if i'm in , i'm in .
okay , you're in .
all right .
what do you think , charlie?
this'll work .
let's go .
you're amazing .
it's a work of genius .
uh huh .
you okay?
just give me a moment .
now?
i'm about to insert this pin into this detonator tube , and if the brass touches the sides , we'll both be the last people we ever see .
take all the time you need .
