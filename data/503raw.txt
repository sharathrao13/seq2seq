see the crows?
they never tasted prince before .
is this what you left me for? !
fight !
fight me !
you coward !
fight me !
we have a pact !
fight !
fight him , son .
fight him .
fight me !
the trojans have violated the agreement !
prepare for battle !
this is not honor !
this is not worthy of royalty !
if he doesn't fight , troy is doomed .
the fight is over .
the fight is not over .
stand back , prince hector .
i'll kill him at your feet .
i don't care .
he is my brother .
paris !
go !
get inside , paris !
archers !
our men are too close to the walls .
pull back , you fool !
for troy !
now !
loose !
get them in line !
get the men back into lines !
front line , push !
forward .
forward !
forward !
apollonians !
now !
prince hector !
we need to retreat !
my army's never lost a battle yet !
you won't have an army if you don't fall back !
back to the ships !
back to the ships !
retreat !
back !
retreat !
go back !
back .
back to the ships !
fall back !
men , fall back !
halt !
halt !
but we have them on the run !
we're in range of their archers .
have our men gather our fallen .
send an emissary to them .
they can collect their dead .
would they have done the same for us?
go !
back !
fall back into line !
you think i'm a coward .
i am a coward .
i knew he would kill me .
you were watching .
my father .
my brother .
all of troy .
shame didn't matter .
i gave up my pride ... ... my honor ... ... just to live .
for love .
you challenged a great warrior .
that took courage .
i betrayed you .
menelaus was a brave man .
he lived for fighting .
and every day i was with him , i wanted to walk into the sea and drown .
i don't want a hero , my love .
i want a man i can grow old with .
they're laughing at me in troy .
drunk with victory !
they think i'll sail home at first light .
maybe we should .
flee?
like a whipped dog?
the men believe we came here for menelaus 'wife .
won't be needing her anymore .
my brother's blood still wets the sand , and you insult him !
it's no insult to say a dead man is dead .
if we leave now , we lose all credibility .
the trojans can beat us so easily .
how long before the hittites invade?
if we stay , we stay here for the right reasons .
to protect greece , not your pride .
your private battle with achilles is destroying us .
achilles is one man .
hector is one man .
look what he did to us today .
hector fights for his country !
achilles fights only for himself !
i don't care about the man's allegiance .
i care about his ability to win battles .
he's right .
the men's morale is weak .
even if i could make peace with achilles , the man won't listen to me !
he's as likely to spear me as to speak to me !
i'll talk to him .
he'll want the girl back .
he can have that damn girl .
i haven't touched her .
where is she?
i gave her to the men .
they need some amusement after today .
come on , give the bitch to me !
who's first?
trojan whore !
what's this?
a virgin's robe?
you won't be needing that much longer !
hold her .
better to be a spartan slave than a trojan ...
achilles !
are you hurt?
i watched you fight them .
you have courage .
to fight back when people attack me?
dog has that kind of courage .
eat .
i've known men like you my whole life .
no , you haven't .
you think you're so different from 1000 others?
soldiers understand nothing but war .
peace confuses them .
and you hate these soldiers .
i pity them .
trojan soldiers died trying to protect you .
perhaps they deserve more than your pity .
why did you choose this life?
what life?
to be a great warrior .
i chose nothing .
i was born , and this is what i am .
and you?
why did you choose to love a god?
i think you'll find the romance one sided .
do you enjoy provoking me?
you've dedicated your life to the gods .
zeus , god of thunder .
athena , goddess of wisdom .
you serve them .
yes , of course .
and ares , god of war?
who blankets his bed with the skin of men he's killed?
all the gods are to be feared and respected .
i'll tell you a secret ... ... something they don't teach you in your temple .
the gods envy us .
they envy us because we're mortal .
because any moment might be our last .
everything's more beautiful because we're doomed .
you will never be lovelier than you are now .
we will never be here again .
i thought you were a dumb brute .
i could have forgiven a dumb brute .
do it .
nothing is easier .
aren't you afraid?
everyone dies .
today or 50 years from now .
what does it matter?
do it .
you'll kill more men if i don't kill you .
many .
my lord , there's ...
tell the men to start loading the ship .
we're going home .
gather the stores .
agamemnon is a proud man .
but he knows when he's made a mistake .
the man sends you to make his apologies?
what are you doing enthralled to that pig of a king?
the world seems simple to you , my friend ... ... but when you're a king , very few choices are simple .
ithaca cannot afford an enemy like agamemnon .
are we supposed to fear him?
you don't fear anyone .
that's your problem .
fear is useful .
we need you back .
greece needs you .
greece got along fine before i was born .
greece will be greece long after i'm dead .
i'm not talking about the land .
the men need you .
stay , achilles .
you were born for this war .
things are less simple today .
women have a way of complicating things .
of all the kings of greece , i respect you the most .
but in this war , you're a servant .
sometimes you have to serve in order to lead .
i hope you understand that one day .
we're going home?
we sail in the morning .
greeks are being slaughtered .
we can't just sail away .
if it's fighting you still long for , there will always be another war .
these are our countrymen .
you betray all of greece just to see agamemnon fall .
someone has to lose .
the gods favor our cause .
now is the time to destroy the greek army .
their morale is battered .
hit them now .
hit them hard .
and they will run .
the myrmidons didn't fight yesterday .
there must be dissension among the greeks .
but if we attack their ships , we will unify them .
if they decide to attack us , let them .
our walls can't be breached .
we'll beat them back again .
yesterday , the greeks underestimated us .
we should not return the favor .
you're confident about the meaning of these omens?
the desecration of his temple angers apollo .
the gods have cursed the greeks .
prepare the army .
we attack at daybreak .
am i still your captive?
you're my guest .
in troy , guests can leave whenever they want .
you should leave then .
would you leave this all behind?
would you leave troy?
hold those barricades !
archers to the rear .
achilles .
achilles .
now !
forward !
enough for one day .
yes .
back to the ships !
back to the ships !
it was his cousin .
to troy !
back to the city !
back to the city !
to troy !
we were going to sail home today .
i don't think anyone's sailing home now .
achilles .
you violated my command .
no , my lord .
there was a mistake .
i ordered the myrmidons to stand down .
you led them into combat .
i didn't lead them , my lord .
we thought you did .
where's patroclus?
patroclus !
we thought he was you , my lord .
he wore your armor , your shield , your greaves , your helmet .
he even moved like you .
where is he?
where?
he's dead , my lord .
hector cut his throat .
don't !
where are you taking me?
do you remember how to get here?
yes .
the next time you come here , follow the tunnel .
there are no turns , so you can't get lost .
just keep walking .
when you get to the end , you'll be by the river .
follow the river until you get to mount ida .
why are you telling me this?
lf i die ...
no . ... i don't know how long the city will stand .
if the greeks get inside the walls , it's over .
they'll kill all the men , throw the babies from the city walls .
please .
the women , they'll take as slaves .
that , for you , will be worse than dying .
why are you saying such things?
because i want you to be ready .
i want you to get our boy , and i want you to bring him here .
you save as many people as you can , but you get here .
and you run .
i killed a boy today .
and he was young .
he was much too young .
that boy has just saved this war for us .
eudorus .
my lord .
i need my armor .
no .
don't go !
rope !
hector's my cousin .
he's a good man .
don't fight him .
please don't fight him .
please .
no .
hector !
hector !
hector !
hector !
father ... ... forgive me for any offenses .
i've served you as best as i could .
hector !
may the gods be with you .
hector .
no father ever had a better son .
hector !
apollo guard you , my prince .
you're the best man i know .
you're a prince of troy .
i know you'll make me proud .
hector !
remember what i told you .
you don't have to go .
you don't .
you remember what i told you .
hector !
hector !
i've seen this moment in my dreams .
i'll make a pact with you .
with the gods as our witnesses ... ... let us pledge that the winner will allow the loser all the proper funeral rituals .
there are no pacts between lions and men .
now you know who you're fighting .
i thought it was you i was fighting yesterday .
and i wish it had been you .
but i gave the dead boy the honor he deserved .
you gave him the honor of your sword .
you won't have eyes tonight .
you won't have ears or a tongue .
this is hector , the fool who thought he killed achilles .
get up , prince of troy .
get up .
i won't let a stone take my glory .
you lost your cousin .
now you've taken mine .
when does it end?
it never ends .
who are you?
i have endured what no one on earth has endured before .
i kissed the hands of the man who killed my son .
priam?
how did you get in here?
i know my own country better than the greeks , i think .
you're a brave man .
i could have your head on a spit in the blink of an eye .
do you really think death frightens me now?
i watched my eldest son die ... ... watched you drag his body behind your chariot .
give him back to me .
he deserves the honor of a proper burial .
you know that .
give him to me .
he killed my cousin .
he thought it was you .
how many cousins have you killed?
how many sons and fathers and brothers and husbands?
how many , brave achilles?
i knew your father .
he died before his time .
but he was lucky not to live long enough to see his son fall .
you have taken everything from me .
my eldest son ... ... heir to my throne ... ... defender of my kingdom .
i cannot change what happened .
it is the will of the gods .
but give me this small mercy .
i loved my boy from the moment he opened his eyes ... ... till the moment you closed them .
let me wash his body .
let me say the prayers .
let me place two coins on his eyes for the boatman .
if i let you walk out of here ... ... if i let you take him ... ... it doesn't change anything .
you're still my enemy in the morning .
you're still my enemy tonight .
but even enemies can show respect .
i admire your courage .
meet me outside in a moment .
we'll meet again soon , my brother .
your son was the best i've fought .
in my country , the funeral games last for 12 days .
it is the same in my country .
then the prince will have that honor .
no greek will attack troy for 12 days .
briseis?
i thought you were dead .
you are free .
if i hurt you ... ... it's not what i wanted .
go .
no one will stop you .
you have my word .
come , my girl .
you're a far better king than the one leading this army .
achilles makes a secret pact , and i have to honor it?
what treason is this?
consorting with the enemy king .
giving him 12 days of peace .
peace !
their prince is dead .
their army is leaderless .
this is the time to attack !
even with hector gone , we have no way to breach their walls .
i will smash their walls to the ground ... ... if it costs me 40, 000 greeks .
hear me , zeus !
i will smash their walls to the ground .
that's good .
for my son back home .
well , odysseus .
you found a way to make the sheep invite the wolves to dinner .
forgive me , eudorus .
i should never have struck you .
you've been a loyal friend all your life .
i hope i never disappoint you again .
it's i who have been the disappointment .
rouse the men .
you're taking them home .
aren't you coming with us?
i have my own battle to fight .
let me march beside you .
no .
i don't want our men to be a part of this .
it's a beautiful night .
go , eudorus .
this is the last order i give you .
fighting for you has been my life's honor , my lord .
open the gates !
here .
plague .
don't go too close , my king .
this is the will of the gods .
they desecrated the temple of apollo ... ... and apollo desecrated their flesh .
they thought they could come here and sack our city in a day .
now look at them , fleeing across the aegean .
what is this?
an offering to poseidon .
the greeks are praying for a safe return home .
this is a gift .
we should take it to the temple of poseidon .
i think we should burn it .
burn it?
my prince , it's a gift to the gods .
father , burn it .
look at them .
you'd think their prince had never died .
you are the prince now .
make your brother proud .
briseis .
where is she?
where?
i don't know .
please .
i have a son .
then get him out of troy .
briseis !
paris !
andromache !
helen .
we must go .
where?
i'll show you .
now .
hurry .
paris .
it's a long way .
quick .
we must go now .
briseis !
paris !
let it burn !
let troy burn !
burn it !
burn it all !
burn troy !
burn troy !
it's a long way .
quick .
come .
i stay .
no .
my father will never abandon the city .
i can't leave him .
the city is dead .
they're burning it to the ground .
what's your name?
aeneas .
do you know how to use a sword?
yes .
the sword of troy .
as long as it's in the hands of a trojan , our people have a future .
protect them , aeneas .
find them a new home .
i will .
hurry .
paris , briseis wasn't in her room .
i'll find her .
go .
i'll stay with you .
go .
please don't leave me .
how could you love me if i ran now?
we will be together again , in this world or the next .
we will be together .
go .
to the gate !
soldiers of troy ... ... you men are warriors !
to lead you has been my honor !
my prince !
the boatman waits for us .
i say we make him wait a little longer !
paris !
paris !
have you no honor?
have you no honor?
too late for prayer , priestess .
i almost lost this war because of your little romance .
you'll be my slave in mycenae .
a trojan priestess scrubbing my floors .
and at night ...
get up !
hold her .
come with me .
no !
paris !
no !
stop !
please !
paris !
don't !
it's all right .
it's all right .
you gave me peace ... ... in a lifetime of war .
briseis , come .
go .
you must .
no .
troy is falling .
go .
we must go .
i know a way out .
it's all right .
go .
briseis , come .
go .
find peace ... ... my brother .
if they ever tell my story , let them say ... ...
i walked with giants .
men rise and fall like the winter wheat ... ... but these names will never die .
let them say i lived in the time of hector ... ... tamer of horses .
let them say ... ...
i lived in the time of achilles .
