after months of speculation analysts expect an announcement this week that globecom lnternational will acquire waterman publishing and its flagship magazine , sports america .
the man at the helm of globecom , billionaire media magnate teddy k. has been on a spending spree recently , acquiring a food service company , a cable operator and two telecommunications providers in deals totaling more than $13 billion .
and how did one lucky ferret owner come to own the largest dog treat manufacturer on the east coast?

mr. kalb .
dan .
thanks for the lakers tickets .
you bet .
seats were terrific .
but i'm still not going to advertise in the magazine .
my son in law tells me that people don't read much anymore .
too much effort moving the eyes back and forth .
so we're gonna put most of our budget into television , radio , lnternet .
okay .
okay "?
what does that mean?
l'm not gonna try to sell you .
why the hell not?
you're a salesman .
yeah .
just not a very good one , that's all .
l'll say .
but i am gonna ask you one favor .
oh , yeah?
l'm gonna leave you an issue of the magazine .
and i'm personally gonna send you a new one every week .
now , i'll call you in a few weeks , and if you want to , we'll talk .
there's a great article in there comparing today's quarterbacks with johnny unitas .
unitas would kick their butts .
so , this is your sales pitch?
l've been with the magazine for 20 years .
i believe in it .
well , good for you .
so , are you worried about all these rumors that your parent company is about to be sold?
no , not really .
l don't see how it would affect us .
well , hopefully it won't .
you know , that teddy k. character offered to buy my business a few years ago .
i told him to go screw himself .
my son in law says i'm a dinosaur .
don't knock dinosaurs .
they ruled the earth for millions of years .
they must've been doing something right simply put , we are never gonna be able to reach this significant , untapped market , until we learn to think like them .
ln point of fact ,
less than . 05 percent of all cell phone users are under the age of 5 years old .
that's why we have the t rex phone and the triceratops phone , and the pterodactyl phone .
'cause it's gonna change all of that and each one of these phones has its own unique ring .
mommy , mommy , i want one .

l'm sorry .
that was , uh ... [ sighing ]
um , i'd like to thank everyone for joining me here .
teddy k. has an ... has a thing that what makes globecom great is the men and women of globecom .
ls it like a thousand degrees in here or is it me?
it's like ...
lt's me .
i have an agenda .
and you're gonna learn this about me .
i'm a machine .
what was i saying about the ... an agenda .
an agenda , i have an agenda .
which is that i have to immediately , um , increase the ad pages here by 20 percent .
20 percent?
carter , only a startup magazine can do that .
yeah , well , i think this team can do it , dan .
um , how?
well , morty , basically what we
god , that's an awesome question .
how?
and the answer
is synergy .
we need to team up here .
yeah , we need to synchronize and we need to synergize .
we're not alone .
we're not alone .
we're part of one of the biggest multimedia and brand name companies in the known universe , okay?
let's let's take advantage of that , like , uh ...
like ...
krispity krunch .
did anyone know that , uh , one of our sister companies is krispity krunch?
so?
so we talk to our brothers and sisters over at krispity krunch .
we make a deal where we supply sports factoids to their boxes .
so that when joe couch potato is sitting there , he's , uh , snacking , he looks down , and what does he see?
sports america krispity krunch sports factoids .
he's definitely buying more krispity krunch and not krunch 'n krackle which , by the way , looks and tastes exactly the same .
but guess what?
no sports factoids .
and krispity krunch is so happy they guarantee us 28 pages a year .
besides which , they know if they don't ,
teddy k. is gonna be pissed .
what is that?
what am i talking about here , people?
synergy .
lsn't that cheating?
no , no .
hell , no .
and , uh , techline cell phones .
we own techline cell phones .
guess what we put on their browser?
factoids .
yes !
factoids !
synergy !
and what else?
uh , box scores .
and ads !
we make a deal like a 100, 000 hits on the lnternet has the equivalent value of one ad page of our hard copy .
are you getting it , people?
the magazine has become just a portal to a synergized world of cross promotion .
we're gonna bust things wide open .
we are gonna take things to the next level .
who's with me?
who's with me?
who who's psyched?
lou , are you psyched?
yeah .
yeah , i'm psyched .
okay .
alicia , are you psyched?
absolutely .
better .
this guy .
i'm sorry , i don't know your name yet .
hector .
i'm in maintenance .
that's cool .
hector ...
hector , i know you're psyched .
l'm psyched !
yes , hector's psyched !
and if hector's psyched , then you know i'm psyched .
i am psyched for this team .
now who else is with me?
who's psyched?
i'm psyched !
excellent .
who else?
come on .
who do you think will be the first to get canned?
my money's on dan .
he's prehistoric .
sorry , dan .
thanks for joining me for lunch .
you like sushi?
l'll just stick with the teriyaki .
you should try some .
the spicy tuna here is money .
come here .
get that .
get that .
yeah , go fishing , man .
yeah .
yeah .
so i wanted to talk to you , [ grunting ]
because , uh ,
this is raw . ... an increase in ad pages is ...
well , it's really only part of the equation in terms of achieving the bottom line my bosses want me to hit .
understand , teddy k. is making cuts across the board here .
ln point of fact , i have to cut $300, 000 salary from the sales team immediately .
l don't make that much money , carter .
i know how much you make , dan .
well ,
l wish you'd told me that i was fired before i ate the goddamn fish .
oh , dan !
dan !
dan !
l'm i'm not letting you go here .
you're not?
no .
you are an excellent salesman .
you ran a good team .
i think that you have the potential to be an awesome wingman here .
an awesome wingman?
b but , carter , i definitely see the benefit for you in having an awesome wingman .
but what is the benefit for me at this point in my career of being an awesome wingman?
well , one benefit at this point in your career is that you get to keep your job .
that's a pretty good benefit , don't you think?
really?
really !
are you smiling?
you're smiling !
this is funny to you .
guess what?
you have no idea what a nightmare you're about to step into , my friend .
a hole !
we'll see how soon this place goes down the poop chute without me .
maybe there is justice in the world .
you enjoying yourselves?
great .

i think we may have to take out a second mortgage .
why don't i just go into the living room and ask my boss for a raise?
oh , hey .

and you've ...
we never got to ...
that day in the elevator .

wow , you're sort of a bizarrely honest guy .
huh?
no .
no .
honestly , i'm ... [ chuckling ]
l'm not .
just around you , for some reason .
people would probably say that i'm an emotionally guarded anal retentive asshole .
you wanna play foosball?
okay .
cool , i'll just change .
okay .
good .
yeah .
do you think alex could cope with living in the city on her own?
well , i'm less worried about her coping with it than i am about you .
yeah , well , frankly , i'd rather keep her under house arrest with a homing device around her ankle .
then why did you agree to it without even talking to me?
and why is your teenage boss here?
and why am i so nauseous?
i hardly had any morning sickness the first two times .
hey , hey , hey ! and i'm so sick of it !
calm down .
let me have that .
l'm not really that into tennis anymore .
what i'm really not into is being the jock .
you know , it's like people don't even invite me to their parties because they think i'm in training or something .
also , there's this rumor going around that i'm a lesbian .
man , that sucks .
or not .
i don't ...
not being a lesbian .
yeah , well , i'm not .
lt'd be one thing if i wanted to go pro and make a ton of money , but i'm not at that level .
l've played girls at that level and i'm not .
l mean , not that i'd want that , really .
their lives have peaked by the time they're like 21 .
oh , nice .
i wonder that about myself sometimes , too .
like maybe my life has peaked at 26 .
maybe it's all downhill from here .
well , it probably is .
yeah .
here you go .
keep the change .
dinner's ready !
l'm on an important call !
with who?
my boyfriend .
your what?
hi , this is mr. foreman .
who is this and how old are you?
all right .
well , i just wanted to say if you ever give my daughter an alcoholic beverage or a joint ,
i will hunt you down and neuter you .
dad !
dinner's ready !
there you are .
you kids ready to come in for dinner?
god .
i lived in the same town as my mom .
and i mean ...
you know what i mean?
the entire ...
the whole family thing was
right .
yes , i'm ...
no , no , it's really not a good time right now .
i know , but i really like him a lot .
oh , my god , this pizza's amazing .
where'd you get this?
lt's from a wonderful little ltalian restaurant called domino's .
so , are you really dad's new boss?
we're not , uh , we're really more colleagues .
no , that's not true .
he's the boss man .
i'm the wingman .
are you married?
you're wearing a wedding ring .
um , yes , i am , sort of .
um , or ...
yes , no .
i'm married .
so you're like prematurely old .
jana , would you pass the pizza?
i got it .
oh , my god , dan .
my bad .
l'm sorry .
i mean , i got it .
i got it .
carter , carter , c carter .
only my wife is allowed to touch me there .
excuse me .
i'm gonna go upstairs .
l'm gonna change my pants again .
good job .
thank you .
thank you so much .
terrific pepperoni , by the way .
you're very welcome .
goodbye .

bye .
sign here , here , and here .
and you've got your second mortgage .
sign , uh , there , there , and there .
and it's official .
you're divorced .
okay , two things .
first , steckle is organizing a company basketball league .
l'm gonna be sales team captain .
you are my new power forward .
and second , i heard you're taking the guys from rums jamaica to the knicks game on wednesday night?
yeah .
you have to run that stuff by me , man .
run it by you?
they're my clients .
no , they're not , dan .
they're globecom clients .
that's why we're gonna be takin ''em to the globecom luxury suite .
well , these aren't luxury suite type of guys .
dan , everyone's a luxury suite type of guy .
uh , we can't go there on wednesday , because teddy k. is hosting bill clinton , jay z , and kofi annan .
we're gonna do it thursday .
l'll bring them to a concert .
look , i gotta get these guys to up their buy by 18 pages .
we gotta start kicking some ass here .
l'm gonna have to let some people go .
why do you say " let them go "?
they don't want to go .
why don't you just say , " fire them "?
because it sounds better .
not to the person getting fired , it doesn't .
# you wanna get with me? # # put 'em up #
# take long trips with me # # yeah #
this guy was shot 1 2 times and pronounced legally dead .
hence the name .
someone should tell him it's spelled d e a d.
they're afraid to .
he's got the number one hit single right now .
he's a protege of 50 cent .
why don't they just call him " nickel "?
what?
20 years , your jokes still haven't improved .
want you guys to meet my colleague .
this is petey from k jam sneakers .
hey , hey .
hmm .
cross promotional idea .
you buy a certain amount of jamaican rum , boom .
you get a discount on running shoes .
done .
yeah , sounds like a great fit .
get a lot of drunk people running around .
dan .
you want to go get some air?
yeah .
be back in a bit .
word .
hey , not too long .
we got chimichangas on the way .
# you wanna get with me?
take long trips with me ##
sorry about the concert .
they wouldn't let me just get regular seats for the knicks game .
no , it's okay .
look , dan .
i've been instructed not to advertise with sports america anymore .
what?
we were bought out last year by this company called continental brands .
apparently , the company that bought us and the company that bought you are having a feud over wireless communications in europe .
wireless communications?
what what the hell does that have to do with our business?
nothing .
but we have this corporate policy now .
look , i'm sorry , dan .
## [ music playing ]
dan , i have to fire louie and morty .
no , you don't .
i do .
we're gonna get those ad pages back .
we'll get those ...
oh , my god !
it's like you don't get it or something .
that was a huge client .
steckle gave me a bottom line here .
i have to increase pages .
we already got harry , pete , and alicia on the ford account .
morty's the logical choice .
oh , and the new woman at pepsi thinks that louie's a sexist .
guess why .
he called her " sugar tits .
he's an idiot .
come on , you can't fire these guys .
these are my guys .
they've been with me for eight years .
i hired them at the same time .
yeah , i know , dan .
that's why they have huge , bloated salaries .
and they're not pulling their weight .
l'm sorry .
well , i've been here for 23 years .
my salary's bigger than theirs .
why don't you just fire me?
do you want me to fire you?
because i could , dan .
you have a family that loves you .
you have a kid on the way .
l look at you sometimes and it's like ...
you have people who need you .
do you really wanna put them in jeopardy for louie and morty?

i should be the one to do it .
guys , i feel really terrible about what i'm about to say .
but i'm afraid you're both being let go .
let go?
what does that mean?
lt means you're being fired , louie .
believe me , if i had any choice in this , i would ...
anyway , i thought you should hear it from me because i'm the one who hired you .
oh .
wait a minute .
are you being fired , too?
no , no .
uh ... [ clearing throat ]
this isn't my decision .
oh , so it's not your decision , so therefore it's not your fault , right?
l didn't say that .
you know , this is bullshit .
louie .
no , no , morty .
you know something?
i look at you like a brother .
l would've stood in front of a bus for you , you piece of shit !
you've turned into a real corporate asshole , you know that , dan?
louie .
do me a favor .
lf you see my friend dan , tell him i'm looking for him .
louie !
dan , what the hell am i gonna tell my wife?
i mean , she already wears the pants .
now she's gonna wear the tie and jacket , too .
morty , i am so very sorry .
i know this must have been hard for you , dan .
you were a good boss .
i mean it .
you always treated everyone with respect .
and i ...
look , i appreciate it .
what's this?
my 360 evaluation .
uh , you rated yourself , " does not meet expectations .
yeah .
l'm gonna cry .
don't .
i'll call you .

that's ...
that's awesome .
yeah , yeah .
what about you?
l'm renting an apartment in tribeca .
oh , yeah?
yeah .
wow , that's awesome .
do you drink coffee?
no !
uh , normally i just hook up to an lv , actually .
my , you sure can pound back the caffeine , huh?
ls that why your leg is shaking like that?
i think it is .
yeah .
you're not wearing your wedding band .
oh .
yeah .
i'm now officially the first person in my high school class to get divorced .
oh , i'm sorry .
no , it's okay .
when i think about it honestly , it was pretty much coming since our second date .
how's ...
how are you?
how's school going?
lt's pretty good .
lt's pretty good .
i mean , you know , it's , it's , uh ... it's hard to meet new people as a transfer .
everybody's got their own little cliques and they're not sure if they want to admit one more .
but , uh , my creative writing classes are really great .
oh , yeah , creative writing?
yeah .
i've just , uh ...
l've always been interested in stories and escaping into other people's lives .
l guess 'cause mine always seems so boring .
l'm cursed with a functional family .
but writing isn't exactly practical .
so i think i might double major in business .
oh , no .
don't do that .
stick with the creative writing .
strange , you know , sometimes you seem sort of bummed out about your career , but you're so successful .
no , i'm not bummed .
uh ...
god , my career is pretty much what i have in my life .
that and a dented porsche , right?
your family must be really proud of you .
my mom is .
you know , she's ...
she's this kind of hippie .
so she's not really into the corporate thing .
and my dad left home when i was 4 , so , you know , i never really got to know him .
his family had money , but , uh , he was this kind of artist you know , in quotes , slash druggy .
uh , he was in this cult for a while .
do you , do you ...
let's get out of here .
do you want to , like , take a walk or something?

you're all going to the 29th floor .
oh , great .
i hear there's , uh , fantastic air conditioning on that floor .
hey , dan , how's your commute?

but , uh , yeah , i'm sure i would've .
well , my oldest daughter , she won't call me back .
and i feel like going down to nyu and kidnapping her so i can stop worrying about her .
that sounds like a really bad idea .
uh , look , alex seems , um , from the very brief time that i met her , to be pretty savvy .
l don't think you have to worry about her too much .
she's a smart , terrific woman .
girl .
or smart young lady .
whatever .
what i'm trying to say is that , uh ,
i think she can probably take care of herself .
dan , you seem to have the perfect marriage .
how do you do it?
you just pick the right one to be in the foxhole with and then when you're outside of the foxhole , you keep your dick in your pants .

dad ...

dad !

this had nothing to do with you .
he's my boss , alex .
i know .
but it just happened .
we made a deal , remember?
we made a deal we'd always be honest with one another .
dad , i was like 5 years old when we made that deal .
yeah .
i liked you better then .
that's awful .
that's an awful thing to say .
dad , please don't walk away .
i want to talk to you .

oh , thanks .
look , i wanted to apologize , uh , for my timing when ...
uh , with the " l " word .
it just kind of slipped out .
but i've been thinking about it a lot lately , and it's how i feel .
it's really important to me
oh , that's really sweet .
well , i mean it .
i know you probably think you do .
but l i've been doing a lot of thinking , too , and i'm taking anthropology classes .
and i'm doing a double major .
yeah .
and i'm just ...
i'm really busy .
yeah .
uh , i'm just not ...
l'm not ready for a big commitment .
yes , that's ... [ chuckles ]
that's what i'm saying .
look , when i said i loved you ,
l didn't mean that i wanted to interfere in your classes or , you know , whatever .
l'm not talking about marriage or anything yet .
carter .
look .
l've had an amazing time with you , and i think you're a great guy .
but you are on the rebound .
no , i'm not .
carter , you are .
i mean , it was not that long ago that your wife left you .
best thing that ever happened to me .
well , that's great .
but then that's a good thing whether you're with me or not .
i think we should stop seeing each other .
alex .
alex , come on .
i just want you to know
i enjoyed talking to you more than maybe anyone in my entire life .
thank you .
me , too .
dad , where have you been?
your cell phone was off .
i tried to call you like a thousand times .
what happened?
where's your mom?
there you are .
are you okay?
l'm fine .
yes , i'm fine .
the baby's fine .
i had a little scare .
there was some bleeding .
what?
what is it?
a placenta previa .
lt sounds bad , but , uh , it's okay .
i just need some rest .
lf anything ever happened to you , i'd just have to pack it in .
oh , i'm afraid you're going to be stuck with me for a while .
how's she doing?
she's okay .
you know , i broke up with carter .
because of me?
no .
because of me .
l'm sorry i lied to you .
but , you know , i think you should know that carter didn't try to seduce me or anything .
lf anything , it was the other way around .
l really don't want to hear the details .
i mean , unless you want to tell me , and ...
no .
no , not particularly .
good .
you must think i'm disgusting .
disgusting?
why on earth would i think that?
l didn't know that you took out a second mortgage .
l don't need to go to nyu .
suny's fine .
it's fine .
no , no , you are staying at nyu .
look , alex .
you're a really smart woman .
and you can take care of yourself .
and i'm going to try and adjust .
you don't have to change , dad .

hi .
ah , mark steckle , how are you?
very psyched .
how's it going?
very good .
good , good .
right this way .
hi .
how you doing?
nice to see you .
how are you?
good to see you .
thank you .
carter duryea .
oh , yes .
cell phones .
yes .
thank you .
l'm at sports america now .
well , that's the flagship .
what happened to your eye?
yeah , what happened there?
i fell i fell asleep at my computer .
just kind of banged right into the monitor .
those things can be dangerous .
keep up the good work .
l wouldn't be surprised if he announces another big takeover today .
teddy k. !
great to see you .
thank you .
thank you .
synergy .
what does it mean?
why does a business swim with it and sink without it , in this new ocean of megabytes , streaming video and satellites?
every day , the world becomes more complex .
and to survive in a complex world , we need complex bonds to interface with it .
ln this room ,
i see this .
what we're trying to get to , is this .
this is unbreakable .
this is inevitable .
what are we building here?
ls it a company?
or are we building a new country with no national boundaries?
a new democracy for the consumer .
a new democracy with a new electorate .
24 hour music videos in kuala lumpur .
computers with parts manufactured in japan ,
greenland , ldaho , lndia .
a soft drink ad going out simultaneously to seven different continents .
the dalai llama eating his krispity krunch while uploading prayers onto the net .
woman's world magazine .
well , why not woman's world channel across the world?
computers .
why not a computer section in sports america magazine?
uh , excuse me .
excuse me .
yes?
uh , uh ...
uh , my name is , uh , uh , dan foreman .
i ...
l work for sports america and i'm not sure
l i understand what you're talking about .
w what i mean is is what do computers have to do with sports?
are you ...
are are you literally saying that there should be a section in the magazine about computers?
who's going to want to read that?
um ... [ clears throat ]
and , uh ... [ sighs ]
l i'm not sure i understand how the way the world is changing is actually going to change how we do business .
we're still selling a product , right?
which hopefully someone needs .
we're human beings with other human beings for customers .
so i don't see how this company is like its own country .
i mean , just because we sell different kinds of things , that doesn't mean we should operate by our own laws , does it?
besides which , countries , at least democratic ones , they have some obligation to their citizens , don't they?
so how do layoffs and bottom line thinking fit into that?
dan foreman .
sports america .
you ask some excellent questions .
excellent , excellent questions .
l'm glad you asked them .
and i'm leaving it to you , to all of you , to answer them .
hmm .
teddy k. !
teddy k. !
teddy k. !
oh , my god , dan .
oh , my god .
good , you're both in here .
you , i'll talk to in a second .
you , have you lost your frigging mind?
well , he said they were excellent questions .
okay , you think this is funny .
you think it's funny to disrespect a great man .
do you know who you were just talking to in there?
that was teddy k. !
teddy k. , god damn it !
look , we've been carrying your fat , bloated salary for way too long .
i want you out of this building within the next 10 minutes .
l'm going to my office .
l'm going to smoke a nice cuban cigar and try to forget that you ever existed .
you , in my office now .
mark , don't do that .
excuse me?
look .
the guy busts his ass and
and what?
nothing .
i'm sorry .
i just ... lf you fire him ,
you're going to have to fire me , too .
wait .
let me get something straight here .
you're throwing yourself in with him?
with this useless , over the hill loser?
think here .
think about what you're doing , because if you're not careful , you could end up like him .
i guess that that would be okay .
all right .
then you're fired , too , you little shit .
well , that's too bad ,
'cause , uh , you're gonna lose a huge account that dan and i've been working on .
it was gonna save the year for us .
without it , the magazine's pretty deep in the red .
really?
what account is that?
you think we'd actually tell you?
you're bluffing .
l don't bluff .
l'm not that good of a salesman .
yeah , well , i don't give a crap .
i think teddy k. will .
see , i'm gonna call him and i'm gonna tell him that you single handedly drove his most profitable magazine , his flagship , right into the ground .
and he'll remember my name .
he likes what i did with cell phones .
you've got 24 hours , or you're both gone .
any ideas?
one .
you got all your research?
yep .
follow my lead .
so , um , how are your daughters?
they're great .
thanks .
how about your grandkids?
uh , they're fine .
my son in law has just enrolled our oldest , ralphy , in a computer camp , whatever the hell that is .
uh , this is my boss , carter duryea .
lt's a pleasure to meet you , mr. kalb .
you have a really awesome company here .
you ...
it's a really awesome , awesome
your boss?
he looks more like your nephew .
well , i've , uh , certainly been learning a lot from dan .
so what happened to your eye?
that's one of the things he learned from me .
are you saying that you punched him in the eye?
why?
well , it's ...
we don't have to really go into it here .
no , no , no , please , please .
i'm i'm i'm rather curious .
why did i hit you?
he called me a dinosaur .
he said i was out of date .
that i'd better step in line .
so you slugged him?
it was a fair fight .
hmm?
right .
mr. kalb , we have a sister company , krispity krunch , that i think we could do a really exciting cross promotion with here , all in the globecom family .
carter , carter .
i think that we could achieve
carter , it's ok .
mr. kalb ,
l don't want get into facts and figures with you today .
you know them already .
i just want to ask you one question .
what is your hesitation about advertising with sports america magazine?
my hesitation is that our ad budget is already overextended .
my son in law has put a lot of money into cable and online .
and now he wants to plow even more money back into it .
but ...
but what?
but he is such an asshole !
i mean , i built this business .
i know more about running this than he ever will .
so , yeah .
i'm gonna make a major ad buy in your magazine .
and then i'm gonna restructure the whole damn ad campaign .
that is great news .
thank you , mr. kalb .
oh .
thank ...
yes .
thank you so much , sir .
you know , i don't give a shit about krispity krunch .
let's just stick with the magazine , okay?
you really slugged him?
yeah .
carter .
oh , my god .
oh , my god , that was amazing .
that was unbelievable !
god , that was actually fun .
what kalb really needed to see was an old fart who beat the crap out of a young punk half his age .
and you know what the best thing is?
lt's the right thing to do .
it will improve his business .
wow , you actually , uh ...
you actually believe in this stuff , huh?
of course i do .
why else would i do it?
hmm?
hey , dan .
where you been?
los angeles .
we made a huge sale .
congratulations .
so did teddy k.
he sold the company to calcor communications .
mark !
what happened?
i thought you said teddy k. was buying another company .
that's what they told me , but he sold us .
l'm out .
wait , you're out?
yeah .
they're reorganizing the whole company .
you're out , too .
i think you're in .
l'm in what?
your old job .
what?
running the department?
that's the rumor .
the whole thing seems so arbitrary .
i feel used .
yeah .
kind of tough to know you're replaceable , huh?
i'm i'm sorry you lost your jobs .

# my heart was going boom , boom , boom #
# son , he said #

that's why i want to talk to you .
i want to offer you a job .
i know we definitely had our moments .
but i think you're a good manager and a good salesman .
and i want you to come here and be my second in command .
wow , dan .
uh , i ...
i really appreciate that .
uh , more than you know .
and i ...
i think if i really want to do this for a living , there's no one i could learn from more than you .
but i ...
look , i don't know what i want to do with my life .
i know that i want it to mean something to me the way that this means something to you .
oh .

and , uh , both girls are ...
they're doing well .
good .
please , uh , give them all my best .
yeah .
dan .
thank you .
for what?
for ...
i guess for showing me a few things .
no one ever really took the time to give me a hard time before .
or teach me anything that was actually worth learning .
all right .
now listen , carter .
i want to tell you something .
you're going to be okay .
you think so?
yeah .

l've been working on some short stories .
oh .

congratulations .

do you have a name yet?
oh , no , that's terrific .
uh , probably because i'm jogging .
no , i'm outside .
yes .
i'm actually jogging outside .
# please # playa del rey .
don't laugh .
# remember me #
l'm thinking about getting into ...
# happily #
# by the rose bush #
# laughing with roses on my chin #
# the time when # # we counted every black car #
# passing your house beneath the hill # # and up until # # someone caught us in the kitchen #
# with knives #
# a mountain range #
# a piggy bank #
# a vision to removed to mention #
# but , please , remember me # # fondly #
# i heard from someone you're still pretty #
# and then #
# they went on to say #
# that the pearly gates # # are so eloquently repeated #
# like words i've lost and found #
# and don't look down #
# and someone save temptation #
# and , please #
# remember me silently #
# ln the car behind the corner #
# you hold my hand #
# between your knees #
# you turn from me #
# said the trapeze , it was wonderful #
# but never meant to last #
# the clouds have passed #
# so we just come up with anger #
# and then #
# the circus moved #
# the parking lot #
# hiding out , a hint of danger #
# so , please , remember me # # fondly #
# you're my uphill crawl , my dear #
# but if i make #
# the pearly gates #
# do my best to make a drawing of god #
# and lucifer #
# a boy and girl #
# an angel kissin 'on a silkscreen of mars #
# the aftermath #
# a marching band #
# all around the fray just trapeze swinging ##
