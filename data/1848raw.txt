unit 77 , hostage situation at 314 elm street .
shots fired .
detectives pruitt and biggs are trying a side entrance .
ready?
yeah .
clear?
clear .
so , what do you think?
i think with all that noise we lost the element of surprise .
not exactly stealth , are we?
i'm talking about you .
i can hear those corduroys rustling two blocks away .
close the door , sir .
you never heard of slacks?
screw you .
i got my first collar wearing these pants .
freeze !
drop the weapon !
crossing .
drop the weapon !
gun !
pru , what are you doing?
look at her hands , roy .
they weren't tied together .
the guy's the hostage .
you shot my wife !
all right , ma'am .
and then?
my husband , he called 91 1 .
then they take him hostage .
ln six months you'll be back with a badge .
except in mayberry you'll be hiding in speed traps and chasing cats from trees .
what?
you got some sudden yearning for boredom?
life , roy .
i got a yearning for life .
can't you feel that feeling?
you're not gonna be in the heat of it all .
i'm gonna start a family .
you were born to be a detective , pru .
it's in your blood .
i don't want it anymore .
last chance !
you were born to be a detective , pru .
do you want to talk about what happened?
sometimes it's better if i don't tell you everything .
i know it must be hard for you to leave .
i love that we're leaving here .
i love that we're never coming back .
now , why is there sleeping bags in the trunk of my car?
well , you know , sometimes it's better if i just don't tell you everything .
i forgot how far it was .
are you tired?
a little .
we'll stop soon , get a drink .
you wanna get me drunk , have your way with me .
that's the current plan .
wait , one minute .
no , less .
it's a lot further than that .
wait .
wait .
no , wait .
look .
that's beautiful , but that's not where we're moving .
that's correct , but it is where we're staying tonight ... ... under the stars and the moonlit sky .
i heard a realtor talk about it .
apparently it's beautiful ... ... and incredibly romantic .
you mean sleep outside?
well , yeah .
we've been cooped up in " box land " for a month .
come on , honey .
please .
please .
you're giving me that look .
you're giving me that look .
yes !
all right .
how are you holding up?
i'm tired .
nothing room service wouldn't cure .
forget it .
we're camping .
suddenly i could use a drink .
well , welcome to the morningstar .
i'm just gonna go to the little girls 'room .
what can i get you?
two shots of cuervo and a coke back .
that wild thing must belong to you .
excuse me?
that's your '66 mustang out there , ain't it?
dual exhaust , wide ass tires .
it's a 1 967 fastback .
it's worth some real dough .
it's a lot of engine for just one man .
you two passing through?
we came up the coast highway .
my wife says it's twice as long , but it's twice as pretty .
well , helensville's pretty quiet , like most places around here .
where you guys staying?
we are camping out .
we've got some pretty scenery .
it's god's country .
ls there another place we can grab a bite?
only place open will be the stop n shop .
it's two miles down the road .
thanks .
thank you .
she says , " i can't do a guy who has 'winona forever 'tattooed on his chest .
hurt like a bitch scraping part off .
now she won't call me .
man , you're stupid .
what's it say now?
" wino forever .
you guys catch a load of that city man's ride?
yeah .
i saw his ride .
twice as long and twice as pretty .
you never camped out as a kid?
no .
you must have wanted to .
not really .
just like that , " no .
let me think about it .
no .
cub scouts have campouts .
you were a scout .
that's only because i thought chicks would dig the uniform .
you're unbelievable .
i got it .
you were right .
it's amazing .
yeah .
what would you ever do without me?
i will never be without you .
lf they blindfolded me , and put you somewhere on the planet ... ... l'd find you .
really?
you that good a detective?
what if you couldn't find me?
well , then i'd spend the rest of my life telling everybody about you .
thank you , darling .
jonah .
feels a little light again , bobby .
i wouldn't know .
that's what the lndian gave me , okay?
let's have a drink .
i've gotta go take care of some things .
i think i worked up an appetite .
i think we both did .

cheetos and chili dogs .
i'll go .
no .
you stay here .
you wanted the view .
enjoy .
honey , come on .
you've been driving all day .
wait a sec .
you think i drive too slow .
i think if you drive any slower , you'd be going backwards .
good .
good one .
ln case you see a bear or something .
lf i do , you might want to help the bear .
be right back .
i love you .
love you too .
i'll love you even more when you bring me food .
cheetos and chili dogs .
chips , candy , salsa .
be right back .
hello .

i was about ready to give up on you .
then i noticed the truck was still here .
i gotta get home .
what's the problem?
i don't have a problem .
maybe i could take care of it .
don't i always take care of it , bobby?
you can't .
don't worry .
i'll handle it .

i'm not worried .

excuse me .
i need to use a phone .
you can use this one .
no , it's private . ls there one outside?
just around the corner .
helensville county sheriff .
i need a sheriff , please .
he's out on a personal matter .
can you tell me what it's about?
no .
when will he be back?
can't say .
would you like to leave a message?
dr. leeds?
how is she?
she's got a nasty concussion .
we're doing a rape kit .
i'm sorry , i have to ask you this .
when was the last time you had sexual relations with your wife?
it was about an hour before .
there's no sign she was actually raped .
she's lost some blood , but you already know that .
can i see her?
there's no treatment other than time .
right now she needs to rest .
any excitement at all could send her back into shock .
these are skin scrapings from under her nails .
i'm sending them to a lab in seattle .
i was a detective in seattle .
lf you put my name on it , i'll call ahead and speed things up .
okay .
yeah , that would be helpful .
thank you .
one more thing ....
that orderly?
has been here all night .
that orderly?
has been here all night .
your wife is in delayed shock .
i better phone the sheriff .
he's here .
down in the basement , level one .
where are you going?
this is off limits .
i need to talk to the sheriff .
sheriff's busy .
go un busy him .
it's an emergency .
yeah , what?
i know who you are , detective .
how?
your wife's admitting form .
what can i do for you?
can we talk?
no .
we just talked .
please excuse me .
i have another matter .
all due respect , sir , but my wife was just attacked in your jurisdiction .
i wasn't some flatfoot guarding a dairy queen .
i worked homicide six years in metro .
so i know you didn't just say you have another matter .
homicide .
so what?
what's your point?
i want in on this investigation .
look , my wife was practically beaten to death .
come on .
this will only take a second .
thanks for doing this , ed .
it's not a problem , morgan .
he's okay .
what have you got for me so far?
it wasn't a fair fight .
his hands are pretty clean , mostly defensive wounds .
from the lividity , i'd say he's been dead about two hours .
eye socket's fractured .
rectangular lacerations with jagged markings are imprinted on the cheekbone .
but not from , say , somebody's ring .
see here?
it looks to me like he's been pistol
hey , not now .
see here?
like , from underneath the grip of an automatic .
it's gotta be 9 millimeter .
or beretta maybe , or it could be a glock .
cause?
cerebral hematoma .
the back of his skull is cracked .
would you all give me a moment , please .
my god .
something wrong , detective?
what?
aside from my wife being attacked?
for a second back there , i thought maybe you'd seen him someplace before .
listen , you can tell the sheriff .
you tell me on the way .
your wife shouldn't be disturbed till morning .
i'll have you back by then .
i think i'm gonna stay here .
i need to talk to you .
you're ....
you're from seattle?
yeah .
how'd you hear about the campsite?
my wife heard it from a realtor .
we got the directions at a bar called the morningstar .
so someone could have heard you talking about going up there?
well , we weren't whispering .
and then you left her alone .
i went to the store .
i left my gun .
what kind of a gun? . 38 , service issue revolver .
you only carried the one?
yeah .
the thing is , detective ... ... we found this .
one shot fired .
yours?
you found it at the campsite?
no , we found it at the murder scene .
which means to me , the same man committed both crimes .
he could have taken it from the campsite where he attacked your wife ... ... and then lost it when he ....
that is my son in there .
someone ran him off the road and then murdered him .
i'm sorry about your son .
thank you .
sheriff?
morgan .
what?
my name .
morgan .
morgan .
you think these crimes are connected?
two assaults , same night .
a few miles apart .
it's a good bet , no?
apparently ....
this wasn't the weapon my son was pistol whipped with .
so do you have any leads?
i have ideas .
sheriff?
yeah .
go ahead , dave .
checked suspects with his priors : assault and battery , rape .
you were right .
we got a name .
i'm listening .
it's that bookie , john drexel .
remember him , mac?
read me his resume .
gambling conviction , time in lompoc .
two double a 's and a double l this year alone .
bobby was into him for a bundle .
i settled that debt personally .
bobby must have went back .
where is he?
his brother says he's over at j. b. 's .
did you get that , detective?
two aggravated assaults ... ... another for lewd and lascivious .
who is he?
he's a creep .
where you going?
wait in the car .
i said , wait in the car .
what did you do?
i didn't do nothing .
come here .
wanna tell me?
tell me what you did .
wanna tell me?
mckenna !
suspect resisted .
suspect died .
you want to tell me?
tell me .
that's it .
come on .
come on .
come on .
enough .
enough .
whatever you think he did , you need evidence to prove it .
where's the bathroom?
down the hall .
i need to get back .
be with my wife .
why don't you let her rest?
i'll get you back there in a couple hours .
you look like you could use some rest .
i'm not tired .
couch is yours if you change your mind .
i'm making coffee .
lf you want something harder , it's in the cabinet .
i'll take some coffee .
all right .
take that shirt off .
what?
take the shirt off .
why?
it's wet , full of blood .
i'll throw it in the machine .
that was bobby about 1 0 years ago .
so were you and your son close?
no , not of late , anyway .
truth is we weren't even speaking .
damn shame of that is that earlier tonight he left me a message ... ... on the answering machine .
that was ... ... the first time i heard his voice in a long time .
what did he say on the message?
not much , really .
he sounded like he was in some kind of fix and he needed to talk .
probably about money .
i just was out in the field .
so , what did he do around here?
worked for this jonah ganz .
he owned that bar you were in earlier tonight ... ... along with some other interests .
he's got his greedy little fingers in a bunch of pies .
i have yet to be able to break one of them .
why would he work for a guy like that?
paid well .
right .
yeah?
okay .
drexel's got an alibi , airtight .
you got something you want to say to me?
no , sir .
i can't imagine what you're going through .
whoever did this to my wife ... ... l want justice too .
okay , then you help me get this son of a bitch .
i'll help you any way i can .
and when you catch him?
what do you intend on doing?
not miss .
you're not serious .
this ain't the city .
only god is watching .
we're police officers .
we take an oath to uphold the law .
we don't have to agree with it .
we just have to abide by it .
so if i gave you a chance to get even ... ... with the guy that attacked your wife , you wouldn't take it?
i don't know what i'd do .
the hell you don't .
everyone .
gentlemen .
this is detective pruitt .
he's going to be assisting us .
show him the same respect you do me .
all right?
let's go back to work .
let's go .
not one stone unturned , okay?
not one damn stone .
can i have one of those?
help yourself .
thanks .
daniel .
daniel .
you probably came down this road last night ... ... on the way to the hospital .
you happen to see anything?
i'd have told you .
remember , we're looking for any sign of a 9 mm .
you'll be here if i need you?
yeah .
listen ... ... she may be the only real witness we have .
lf she's up to it , see what she remembers .
so she can relive this whole nightmare in some damn trial?
there won't be any trial .
bobby struck down the power line ... ... probably causing an outage in the area .
so let's start by getting the time frame .
have we ruled out robbery?
that's been bugging me , mac .
perp stole a . 38 from that campsite , but took nothing from bobby .
wallet and watch were still on him .
with bobby , it was personal .
what about this?
why pistol whip with a . 9 when he'd lifted pruitt's . 38?
i'm stuck on that too .
we got two sets of prints from the gun , not three .
they belong to the pruitts .
where'd you get pruitt's?
they're on computer file .
his wife's are from personal items .
maybe our man wiped his own prints off .
and left the other two intact?
no , he definitely dropped ... ... that . 38 by accident at the struggle .
we got to get some prints .
where do we start?
where do we start?
why'd someone want him dead so bad they beat him to death?
man has a gun on you , you'd do whatever he says ... ... even let him knock you around .
look .
it's the middle of the night , middle of nowhere , no witnesses .
lf he wanted to kill him , he'd shoot him .
why take the time to beat him?
that's my point .
i mean , there's lots of motives ... ... but this guy's ....
this guy's was rage .
make a list of the people that are least likely to mourn bobby's passing .
and he also left me a message at about 1 0 : 00 .
find out where that came from .
what about this detective pruitt?
what about him?
we should check him out some more .
save it .
he's a cop .
he's going through the same thing i am .
dr. cody to the pharmacy .
dr. cody to the pharmacy , please .
dr. graham and dr. stephen to icu .
dr. graham and dr. stephen to icu .
it's an emergency .
come on .
thanks , man .
sorry about that .
sure .
detective bureau .
biggs .
roy , it's pru .
retired country man .
don't tell me .
the boredom's got to you already .
listen , partner , i need a favor .
and i need it really quick .
dr. leeds?
you need to check with lab processing .
there's an evidence bag coming to you .
my name's on it .
evidence?
why would your name be?
i'm helping out a sheriff with a sexual assault case .
roy , the envelope has a blood swatch and some skin scrapings .
can you cross the samples and see if they're from the same guy?
sure i can .
danny , is everything okay?
how's jess?
i'll fill you in later .
and don't tell anyone else .
don't talk to anyone else .
i'm on it .
i'll call back .
killer .
car .
it's a killer .
why was your picture in his wallet?
i was his girl for a while .
didn't last long .
why not?
he hardly ever touched me .
i broke it off .
was he angry about that?
him?
angry?
he stole my car .
did you turn him in?
no , his daddy found out and brought it back .
whole thing was sort of funny at first ... ... and after that , i hated him .
why's that?
he beat the living crap out of me .
he beat the living crap out of me .
it's him .
it's him !
morgan .
morgan , i need to talk to you .
not now .
there's something i need to tell you .
i wanna show you something .
what is it?
it's another shot .
come on .
get something this time?
yeah .
he was at the bar with some other men .
he was with bobby .
he and bobby work for ganz .
anyway , his name's jay redmond sawyer .
you don't remember talking to anybody besides the barmaid?
there was a lot of people at the bar .
and you don't remember seeing my son there?
i can't be sure .
well , maybe your wife will remember him .
what?
forgot to pee?
you'll need more evidence to link him to either crime .
he's a registered sex offender .
he was with bobby .
someone saw him with a handgun .
what's the matter with you?
come on , detective .
you ride with me .
you must think you're pretty smart .
what's that supposed to mean?
i guess you'd have to be , passing your detective exam so young and all .
the job wasn't what you think .
sometimes you're lucky to get home .
that's the thing about luck .
it often runs out when you least expect it to .
think i could ever be a hotshot detective like you , mr. pruitt?
i don't really know .
yeah , you must be one smart cop .
i guess all those merit citations cancel out those justifiable homicides .
you checking up on me?
have i done something to offend you , deputy forrest?
may i call you david?
no , you may not .
you listen to me , detective .
we don't need outsiders telling us how to do our job .
we know how to do our job .
morgan asked me to help with this case directly or indirectly .
i don't care what he told you .
i know you're involved in all this , directly or indirectly .
guard the entrance .
the only other way out's that back alley .
lf you have to shoot , don't miss .
yes , sir .
mac , can i have a word?
yeah , just a sec .
you might need this .
i took the liberty of having tustin reload it for you .
go upstairs , look around .
don't do anything .
just wait for me .
what?
but i might remind you no calls .
the young man has been paying off his casino markers with your money .
such men who find themselves in debt sometimes panic ... ... maybe threaten to make our arrangement together public .
and that , mr. ganz , can never happen .
yes .
well ....
a new man will be making the pickups , starting this weekend .
i don't like being here .
don't make me come back .
i said , no more calls .
i'm sorry , sir .
it's the police .
a detective pruitt .
get a number .
he's not calling , sir .
he's here .
can i help you?
i'm here to question one of your employees .
i assume you have a warrant .
red sawyer's an ex convict .
we don't need a warrant .
can you find red sawyer and ask him to come up here?
mckenna .
i'm truly very sorry .
almost had a heart attack when i heard about bobby .
you need a heart for that .
this is hardly the time to allow bad blood to boil between us .
bobby was an important man in my business .
i'd given him a promotion .
he was like a son to me .
he was my son .
we both have the same interests here , sheriff .
to right a terrible wrong .
mr. pruitt , isn't it?
try one of my montecristos .
cubans .
just got them yesterday .
had a hell of a time getting them here , but worth the trouble .
no , thanks .
well , yes .
they are illegal .
you're not here to arrest me , are you?
cut the crap .
mckenna , why don't you just get off me?
i loved bobby .
you .
you stay out of my face .
boss , what's up?
we've got you on a parole violation .
come down to the station with us .
we need a chat .
gun !
stop it !
call an ambulance .
wanna tell me what you were doing back there?
no .
you tried to kill him .
you almost killed me .
don't impede my investigation .
this is your own personal manhunt .
listen , son .
you got enough problems .
you want another one right now?
the thing is , forrest was shot with a 9 mm .
you tell me ... ... why this guy would run if he wasn't guilty .
why?
where's red now?
they're sewing him up .
he's guarded .
he'll spend the night here .
look , i wanna interrogate him .
so do l .
you can't beat the truth out of him .
ls that right?
you want the truth?
you know exactly what i want .
yeah .
you made that pretty clear .
tomorrow , first thing , we'll go by the crime scene ... ... find the evidence we need to clean this up .
i want you there .
you got a place to stay tonight?
i'll be right here .
sorry .
she making any progress?
no .
she's still pretty out of it .
when she's more alert , i'd like to show her red's mug shot .
doc says that's too risky .
this is not a request .
she's got to be questioned .
don't you mean interviewed?
she's a victim , not a suspect .
you listen .
your wife was attacked .
that's a damn tragedy ... ... but she is still alive .
doc , we're leaving in the morning .
sheriff mckenna says she's a material witness in two felony crimes .
now , i had to sedate her again .
i think he aims on hearing what she has to say .
there's something else .
we couldn't save the baby .
no , that's a mistake .
she's not pregnant .
actually , she was .
about five weeks .
i'm sorry .
jess .
i'm here .
jess .
i'm sorry .
no .
i'm sorry .
i'm so sorry .
i shouldn't have left you .
everything's gonna be okay .
morning .
morning .
we'll leave in the morning .
dog .
dog .
knife .
morning .
morning .
jess , who did this to you?
morning .
what happened to that machine?
it's on its way to the junkyard .
skin scrapings and blood from that shirt are the same type , b negative .
but that don't mean squat .
they'll have to wait for the dna .
they did find something odd in that blood on the guy's t shirt .
what is it?
it's full of anabolic steroids .
one major side effect , no lead in his pencil .
know what i mean?
guy like that probably wouldn't try to rape anybody .
danny , you still there?
yeah .
i'm still here .
your sheriff pal sent a blood sample to be matched a couple of hours ago .
name on it was redmond sawyer .
this mckenna was asking questions .
what did he want to know?
spoke to the cap about your service record .
you want to tell me what's going on?
roy .
i don't want to get you in the middle of it .
i'll call you back .
sheriff?
what?
we got a bullet casing .
it's a 9 millimeter .
can i see that?
lf that matches red's gun , i'd say that's all i need .
you have the ability to check that out here?
do we have the ability?
yes , we damn sure do .
yes we do .
come on , let's put an end to this .
so , smitty ...
so , smitty ...
... red's guilty , right?
yes , sir .
he shot david , sir .
i mean , my kid .
lf he did , not with the gun he had .
ed compared the grip of his beretta with the marks on bobby .
they don't match .
what about the bullet casing?
the case you brought in wasn't fired from red's gun .
wait for the blood to match .
sir?
yeah .
bobby's truck caused a power outage on the highway .
the lights went out about 1 1 .
1 1?
right .
wayne's got those impressions .
he's getting a size and type for the suspect's tire .
he says he's close .
well , where is he?
outside , dropping off red's pickup .
weren't those impressions smudged?
we got a pretty good one .
ls that forrest's desk?
yeah .
he wanted me to find some evidence bag and get it to mckenna .
excuse me .
you looking for something?
these were the first photos taken?
yeah .
who was on the scene first?
i was .
look . ln all these photos , the doors to the trailer are open .
yeah , that's right .
they were open when i got there .
so?
ls there a way they can be unlocked from the inside?
no .
not unless they were busted open .
were they?
did you examine the bolt?
what's this got to do with it?
i locked and latched the doors before i had it towed .
i didn't see any evidence to suggest that bolt had been broken .
cerebral hematoma .
the blow that killed him was to the back of the head .
someone went back there and surprised him .
maybe so .
you expect me to talk?
i expect you to die .
morgan .
morgan !
get off him .
get off !
you see that?
he tried to end me .
help me out or i'll wake him up ...
... and find a bigger pillow .
i didn't kill anyone .
you saw bobby leave the bar .
he left for an hour .
he came back .
he went for my wife .
your wife?
bobby?
hell , no .
i got proof .
he went to steal your damn car .
how'd he get up there?
i don't know .
what'd bobby do for ganz?
he was making jonah's pickups from the casino .
kickbacks .
but bobby was skimming off the top .
how'd you find that out?
and you were making bobby pay to keep quiet .
how could you know that?
you just told me .
well , so what?
i knew jonah would find out sooner or later .
he couldn't have bobby telling his dad about the poison on the reservation .
he figured he might blackmail him if he didn't back off about the money .
but bobby never would have talked .
he left a message at his dad's .
what did he say?
i don't know .
he was gonna leave town , but ....
somebody killed him .
yeah .
i heard it was you .
he came back to the morningstar alone .
he said your car wasn't there .
he seemed messed up , scared .
morningstar .
who has a dog and carries a knife?
a lot of guys around here carry knives .
he was alone the first time .
what about the second time?
the last i saw him he was with jonah .
go bug him .
it's friday .
he'll be at the fight club on ninth .
one more thing .
where'd bobby stash the money?
don't say the bank .
find bobby's truck .
there's a panel under the driver's seat .
he kept it in a gym bag in there .
i don't get it .
it's the wrong gun , wrong blood .
it's all right .
you just need to sleep it off .
what?
the liquor or the chokehold you put on me?
sorry about that .
your dad alive?
yeah .
ls he a cop?
yeah .
whatever i couldn't do ... ... or i didn't do for my son when he was alive ...
... l gotta make it up to him now .
you understand that , don't you?
yeah .
i understand that .
good night .
dad?
it's bobby .
i tried you earlier , but ....
listen , i gotta tell you something .
it's bad .
i'm trying to stop it .
look , i can't talk right now .
i'll try you later on , okay?
dad?
i'm sorry .
we're closing up .
come back tomorrow .
detective pruitt .
i'm looking for the hospital washing machine .
why?
because i work in the none of your damn business division .
they're over there .
turn those lights back on .
i can't .
they're on a timer .
for god's sake , billy . lf you don't throw a jab , he'll do that every time !
tough sport , boxing .
so they say , detective .
you ever throw on the gloves for competition?
back in the day .
you?
no , no , no .
i prefer the corner .
that's where you really control the fighters .
you got another one of those?
sure .
thanks .
glad to see someone who can appreciate the finer things .
billy , if you're not gonna trade jabs ... ... then get out of the damn ring !
bobby enjoy the finer things?
bobby's taste in tobacco ran closer to camels than cubans .
something he learned from his father .
so he never smoked one?
i would say not .
well , i found one in bobby's rig .
it was a montecristo .
one of yours?
attaboy , billy .
go after him .
go after him .
bobby was using one of my company trucks .
i could have left that there .
i considered that .
but you said these cubans came the day bobby was killed .
you did say that , right?
meaning?
lf you just got them , how could they be in bobby's rig before that night?
ls this going somewhere , detective?
yeah , it is .
and so are you .
mr. ganz .
mr. ganz , i did it .
deputy , i want to press full charges against this man .
harassment , police brutality , assault .
shut up .
you're out of your province .
called a citizen's arrest .
you picked a pretty prominent citizen .
what's the charge?
murder .
and who did he supposedly kill?
bobby mckenna .
i see .
and how do you know that?
his prints will match those on a cigar band i found in bobby's truck .
he isn't even a police officer .
how can you trust any evidence he may have planted in my truck?
sorry . lf mr. pruitt has something to say about this , mckenna will listen .
i found this in a panel underneath the seat of bobby's truck .
ganz killed bobby for stealing .
tell mckenna .
maybe you better tell him .
what is this?
the nail in his coffin .
i don't understand why we're in a hurry .
that would take too long to explain .
sometimes it's better if you don't have to tell me everything?
you're just gonna have to trust me .
are you okay?
yeah .
all right .
ready?
yeah .
where are you going?
we're leaving .
thank you for your concern .
he what?
brought ganz in late last night .
claimed he killed bobby over some money bobby was stealing .
a lot of cash .
his lawyer drops by like clockwork .
where did pruitt come up with this?
that cigar band was in bobby's truck .
claims ganz's prints are on it .
i checked .
there is a thumbprint .
mean anything to you?
yeah .
it's cuban .
ganz just got them .
you searched that truck .
how did you miss all this cash?
he claimed it was in a panel under the seat .
look , mac , something else .
what?
after pruitt left , wayne came by here .
had these with him .
claims the impressions we found ... ... match the whitestone tires on pruitt's car .
exact same tire type .
i talked to david .
he found a section of whitestone tire at the murder scene .
i looked through his desk and couldn't find it .
morgan , you said yourself he had a blowout recently .
pruitt could have taken evidence .
what are you saying?
wayne also brought over a 9 mm automatic .
a glock .
he found it in a washing machine at the junkyard .
so?
those machines were just taken there .
pruitt's prints are on the 9 .
i called his captain .
all metro detectives are issued a . 38 .
yes , i know that .
well , his primary was a 9 glock .
yeah .
well?
the shell casing was fired from the 9 wayne brought .
all right .
call the hospital .
get somebody to his wife's room .
doc leeds said he took her and left .
why not tell me that tomorrow?
danny , can you slow down?
jess ... ... you were attacked .
you pointed a man out and said he was the one .
he wasn't .
now that man's dead .
i didn't do it .
the best thing for us to do is get out of here .
danny .
danny , he had tattoos .
he had tattoos .
the dog and the knife?
you were describing those tattoos .
there was another man .
he just stood there and he watched it happen .
i understand now .
you know who did this?
yeah .
i know who did this .
you can't just let him go free .
this is your career , mckenna .
you think about that .
lf what pruitt says holds water , it's your life .
you think about that .
got a fresh eyeball .
he's turned on 21 south toward thejunkyard .
he's picking up his gun .
everyone stay clear .
i'll handle this on my own .
he's picking up his gun .
everyone stay clear .
i'll handle this on my own .
danny .

danny .
danny !
danny , no !
no !

danny !
drop the weapon .
no .
don't test me , boy .
danny !
he attacked my wife .

start making some sense .
it's okay , jess .
tell me .
it's him .
are you absolutely sure?
yes .
all right .
we promised to help each other .
i'll go first .
next case .
i didn't kill your son .
you're a liar .
he went to steal my car .
when the car wasn't there , wayne changed the plan .
i didn't kill your son .
look , morgan .
i found this varsity pin from his jacket .
he left it there .
that's why he left you the message .
he had to tell someone .
dad?
i'm sorry .
i was on that road looking for a hospital ... ... and we almost collided .
jess thought he was the guy .
i jumped him and put him in the locked trailer .
when your deputies arrived , the doors were open .
you've seen the photos .
look , i left your son alone .
he was alive .
it was ganz .
he was in front of the cab the whole time .
he went back there and he finished him .
that's why the cigar band was in there .
you lied to me .
you gotta believe me .
you gotta believe me , morgan .
it was ganz .
bobby had things on him that would bury him forever .
look at him .
he knows .
he's not going anywhere .
it was pruitt !
damn you , mckenna .
ask his wife .
go on , ask her .
she was there .
she saw everything !
how the hell would you know that?
your boy was a thief , mckenna .
turn around .
the both of you turn around .
turn around .
what are you gonna do?
shoot me?
a dozen people know you brought me here .
yeah .
you're right .
i can't shoot you .
morgan .
i'm sorry .
lf there's anything i can do ....
i feel a little better .
how about yourself?
withholding evidence , impeding on a criminal investigation ... ... aggravated assault .
i'll clean that all up .
why don't you take your beautiful wife and get the hell out of here?
lf you ever come back , come by and talk to me .
