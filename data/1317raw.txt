thank you .
you're welcome .
i mean , she owned a business , right?
like , selling antiques .
and she used to work for the mayor's office as an advisor .
but she said she didn't like it .
so ...
wow , two careers already .
yeah .
so i thought that she would understand , you know , the kinda work that you gotta put in when you're first startin 'out .
but ...
she said that she couldn't be number three or number four on someone's list of priorities .
she said she could be number two , but not if number one was selling diapers .
hi .
it's me calling to see how things are going .
this is ...
hi .
hello?
it's a work related call .
i'll just be one second .
yes , can you get the?
please figure out if the negatives are gonna be ready by tomorrow .
what? !
how's it going?
it's not .
it'll be fine .
as long as you're not wearing that orange sweatshirt .
don't call back here .
sorry about that , i just ...
where are you going?
what's your stance on pancakes?
i'm pro pancakes .
do you know what you're gonna have yet?
i just can't ...
i can't decide what to get .
come on , ollie , you gotta just let it go .
smile .
you're here with me .
there it is .
that's the one .
hi .
oh , my god , gina , hi !
how are you?
i'm good , how are you?
i'm good .
it's been such a long time .
really long , yeah .
i've been meaning to call you .
me too .
i was hoping that we could actually get together and talk a bit .
yeah , that would be great .
it'd be good .
do you have a coupla bucks for the waitress?
emily .
hi .
hey .
uh , it's ...
how's everything?
how are you?
i'm good .
yeah?
you're good?
yeah .
oh .
great .
i was gonna sneak on by , but then i thought ,
i saw you , so you probably saw me and ...
yeah , no , it's good that you both said hi .
i knew that she'd be fine with it .
i mean , it's been a long time .
yeah , no , i'm glad you sa ...
hi .
hey .
oliver .
peter .
oh .
oliver .
hey .
good to see you again .
um , you know , we should probably go if we're gonna catch that ...
oh .
you're right .
emily , take care .
yeah , take care .
it was good to see you .
bye .
nice meeting you !
oh , i'm starvin '.
let's get outta here .
ok .
all right .
come on .
let it go .
smile .
you're with me .
shut up .
get off the road , grandma !
come on .
let it go .
smile , you're with me .
no .
where we goin '?
we're headin 'north .
i've been killin 'myself at work .
nights , weekends .
even at home .
well , bridget's home .
see , i moved in with her .
that was my big mistake right there .
i shoulda stuck with the plan .
i mean , the plan was working .
you know , the irony of it is that bridget actually loves plans .
we used to go on these trips .
she would plan everything down to , like , the very last detail .
i mean , like , including the gas station that we were gonna stop at .
i remember this one time ... ... we were in ashland , right?
we were at this b& b station , right?
and it starts raining , right?
and i'm not talkin 'about regular rain .
it was like torrential downpour rain .
so bridget comes up with this great idea , right?
park the car in the car wash .
because who's gonna wash their car when it's raining?
come on .
do you want something?
just ... just pick something .
did you buy the whole store?
want some pie?
you want some cheetos?
oh , look at the moon .
let's pull over .
did you love him?
peter?
no .
maybe a little .
do you love bridget?
yeah , i guess so .
well , do you or don't you?
i thought i did .
well , if it wasn't love , it was a lot like it .
ok , now i don't know .
sounds stupid when i say it out loud .
honestly , if you're not willing to sound stupid , you don't deserve to be in love .
take this .
what?
what was that?
what?
that .
i didn't hear anything .
oh , my god !
oh !
oh , my god .
are you ok?
ollie , are you all right?
ok , i'm freezing ...
whoa , you just looked .
no , i didn't .
you said you weren't gonna look .
i didn't look .
go .
i looked .
ooh , looking good .
shut up .
ooh , very nice .
you're just taking advantage of me right now .
come on .
ok , the shutter's gonna stay open for 40 seconds .
you have to keep very still , ok?
ok .
are you ready?
ready .
ooh !
ow !
ow !
ooh , it's cold .
hi .
no moving .
you're moving .
i can't help it .
folks , can i talk to you out here for a second?
folks .
folks , this is a national park .
why don't you get back in your clothes , back in your car and back on the highway .
have a nice day .
i gotta go .
ok .
so anyway , we got this big vc meeting in new york .
gotta put on this big dog and pony show .
you know what vc is , right?
no .
it's venture capital .
it's like a big influx of cash , to really help us grow our business .
it sounds exciting .
i'll grab this .
i got it , i got it .
well ...
you got my number .
and you've got mine .
yes , i do .
so i'll let you know how things go ... in new york .
oh , yeah , yeah .
good .
i've still got some ... some , like , feelings to sort through .
about ...
bridget?
yeah .
i didn't forget .
it's " bridget .
i ...
it's ...
it's ok .
is it?
yeah .
i met someone .
you met someone?
yeah , i mean , it's not like we're getting married or anything , but ...
wait , i'm ...
i'm confused .
this ... this is someone different?
not the writer guy?
yeah , no , a different guy .
a new guy .
a different guy?
what?
i don't ...
you know , it's ...
thank you .
so ...
don't .
you'll ruin it .
get outta here , i'm sick of you .
pitch and go .
pitch and go , keep up the pace .
it's not a big deal .
i'm sorry .
it actually is quite a big deal .
but don't go too fast .
ollie , you get really jittery when you go too fast .
and i need to make sure that you don't speed through the whole thing in such a way that nobody understands exactly what you're saying .
because we invested a lot of time , and everything that we're that we're do ...
jeet o , i need you to shut up .
all right?
this is exactly what i'm talkin 'about .
you're driving me crazy .
so ... ... the baby ...
the ...
client .
the client inputs the child's data and the baby actually tracks its growth .
so when it's time to move up to a bigger size ...
there it is .
bam .
just on your doorstep .
no hassle , no fuss .
does the baby have a name?
does the baby have a name?
yes .
what were we saying for the baby's name?
freddy .
freddy .
doesn't have to be fred .
gabe ... was another choice that we came up with .
gabe the babe .
my point is , is that there are 10, 000 babies born every hour .
that's 254, 000 babies a day .
and somebody's gotta figure out where to put all that shit .
i wanna be that guy .
10, 000 babies an hour .
wouldn't that be 240, 000 babies a day?
yes .
it was good , ollie .
you were great .
i mean , there was that one little thing , but i don't think it was a big deal .
how about you?
you think it was good?
great .
it's mine .
hey , i'm jeeter .
how ya doin '?
hi .
hello?
ollie?
hi .

blue .
that's perfect .
today's her birthday .
talk to me .
i don't know what to say .
doesn't matter .
all right .
there's ...
there's this kid , ok?
and he's in his backyard and he's digging a hole .
and the neighbor lady looks over the fence and says ,
what you doing over there , little johnny?
and the kid looks really sad and he says , " well , my goldfish died .
and so i'm having a funeral for it .
and the lady says ,
well , that's an awfully big hole for a goldfish .
and little johnny says .
well , that's because he's inside your stupid cat .
you know , that's terrible .
thank you .
