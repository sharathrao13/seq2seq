it is said that over 1 50 years ago ... ... in the town of darkness falls ... ... matilda dickson was adored by all the children .
whenever one of them lost a tooth , they would bring it to her ... ... in exchange for a gold coin ... ... earning her the name " the tooth fairy . " but fate was not kind to matilda .
one night , fire tore through her home on lighthouse point ... ... leaving her face horribly scarred .
matilda's burned flesh was so sensitive to light , she could only go out at night ... ... always wearing a porcelain mask ... ... so no one could ever look upon her face .
one day , two children didn't come home .
the townspeople blamed matilda .
they hanged her ... ... tearing off her mask , exposing her hideous face to the light .
and with her dying breath ... ... matilda laid a curse upon darkness falls .
the next morning , the two children were found , safe and sound .
the town buried their secret along with matilda's body .
" what i took before in kindness ... ... i will take forever in revenge .

please stay in the light .
please stay in the light .
please stay in the light .

there's nothing to be afraid of .
mom .
there's no next of kin .
the state will look after him .
larry !
caitlin !
what happened?
she was already dead when we got here .
i heard he was having some problems , but jesus christ .
looks like his mom put up a bit of a struggle .
okay .
kyle?
kyle , this is dr. jenkins .
i want you to go with her .
caitlin?
caitlin?
caitlin .
sorry .
as i was saying , noctiphobia is very common among his age group .
now , we've run one cat scan and two mrls at your behest ... ... and the conclusions all say the same thing .
there's nothing wrong with your brother .
my brother hasn't slept more than 1 0 minutes at a time ... ... for the last three weeks .
you go tell him there's nothing wrong with him .
we've run every test possible .
there's nothing more we can do .
what happened?
he was asleep .
i just closed the blinds .
i didn't think that ....
i saw her .
i saw her .
it can't be dark .
it's okay , michael .
i won't let them shut off the lights , okay?
i promise .
it'll be okay .
it's okay , michael .
hello?
hi . ls this kyle walsh's number?
this is caitlin greene .
that's not funny .
kyle .
hey , it's cat .
you asked me to the dance but never took me .
caitlin?
" yeah .
hey , you are ...
... hard to track down .
i know it's been forever .
i'm sorry .
where are my manners?
how are you?
fine .
what do you want?
right .
right .
it's my brother , michael .
he's in the hospital , and he ....
he's really scaring me .
he won't sleep , not even 1 0 minutes at a time ... ... and now he won't let us shut off any of the lights .
doctors say he has something called noctiphobia or ....
night terrors .
right .
i remembered that's what they said you had when your  when your mother was killed .
anyway , i just thought maybe you could tell me how you got over it .
i didn't .
you must be michael .
it's okay , man .
i'm not gonna hurt you .
i just wanna talk a little .
my name's kyle .
your sister says you're afraid of the dark .
makes it tough to sleep .
you get a lot of sleep?
me neither .
well , this was a bad idea .
caitlin says that when you grow up , you're not afraid of the dark anymore .
ls that true?
yes .
why not?
because you grow up and you realize that there's nothing to be afraid of .
then why are you still afraid?
well , sometimes old habits die hard .
you wanna see something?
this flashlight , it's my peace of mind .
she won't come in the light .
who?
you know who .
no .
i don't know who .
yes , you do .
you've seen her too .
why would you say something like that , michael?
because it's the truth .
sometimes i think of turning off all the lights ... ... and letting her come and take me .
sometimes i think that would be easier than being so scared .
did you ever think that?
she's gonna kill me , you know .
no one's gonna kill you , michael .
nothing's gonna happen to you .
your sister won't let it .
my sister can't stop her .
no one can stop her .
kyle?
i can't believe you came .
that makes two of us .
so ....
so , what do you think? ls he?
what do the doctors say?
that he's a kid , he's just afraid of the dark , he's confused .
growing up here will do that to you .
listen ....
i hate to ask you this , but ... ... when your mother died , what really happened to you?
cat , it's
because it seems like it's the same  no .
but the things he says  they're just things .
but these ....
kyle?
did michael just lose a tooth?
yes , his last one .
but ....
come on , kyle .
you don't still believe that , do you?
i mean , we all grew up with it , but it was just a story to scare us .
i'm sorry , caitlin .
this was a mistake .
look , will you just?
wait a minute , please .
i don't think i know how to help michael .
hey , catey .
kyle?
larry .
you came .
that's terrific .
it's great to see you , buddy .
all right .
i came straight from work .
so is there any reason for us to panic , or what?
no , no .
good .
good .
well , that's what i keep telling catey .
we have some of the best doctors in the state in this hospital .
how about i take you two guys out to dinner tonight?
what do you say?
we can celebrate the prodigal's return .
i think i'm just gonna stay here with michael .
okay .
yeah .
well , good night , honey .
caitlin?
i'm sorry .
well , kyle , what do you feel like doing?
i feel like i've been here too long already .
wait .
we could go to the lnn , right?
i don't drink .
come on , kyle .
i haven't seen you in 1 2 years , man .
one drink's not gonna kill anybody , right?

come on , sit down .
okay , i need to try to get this gravel out of your scalp .
so how did this happen?
okay .
how about telling me about the last 1 2 years of your life in 25 words or less?
i went to a foster home ... ... and we moved out west to las vegas ... ... and now i work in a casino .
ls that 25 words yet?
keep going .
are you and larry going out?
why do you ask?
i don't know , i just
got it .
i don't know what i'm doing wrong .
don't give him any more tests .
what?
they stuck me with every needle ... ... gave me more rorschachs than i could count , and it didn't do a thing .
don't let that happen to michael .
kyle walsh .
you're gonna have to come with us .
you ever see anything like this , dad?
ln this town , you'd be surprised .
what's with all the flashlights?
are you afraid of the dark?
yes , sir .
lf you knew why , you'd think i was crazy .
klonopin .
darvocet .
shit , this one i can't even pronounce .
doc says half of these are antipsychotics .
now , i don't know much about medicine , but it occurs to me ... ... that if a man is taking antipsychotics , he might have a tendency to become ... ... well , psychotic .
ray's dead .
he's dead?
i think you had something to do with it .
i didn't kill him .
i didn't do this .
no , it must have been ....
i don't know .
he hasn't been the same since his mom's murder .
he's not a killer .
how do you know?
you haven't seen him in 1 2 years .
because i know .
he's a good man .
he's been a ward of the state .
but he came to help michael .
he was in a mental hospital for nine years .
caitlin , he's a dangerous guy .
i had a file sent over from state hospital about you .
ten feet long .
you spent a lot of time there .
major disassociative syndrome , night terrors ... ... sociopathic tendencies , three suicide attempts .
i didn't do this .
you did it , kyle .
don't turn away .
you killed your mother and you killed ray .
didn't you?
i need to call my lawyer .
i don't believe this .
i'm going .
caitlin , i'll be in touch .
caitlin .
i have to get back to michael at the hospital .
matt .
keep working on your crap story .
hope you got a good lawyer .
i can handle this .
i can handle this .
i can handle this .
black cat .
why not?
michael !
michael !
michael , open the door !
michael !
i'll call security .
michael?
can you hear me?
it's okay .
she's gonna get me .
it's okay .
your brother is suffering from a form of pavor nocturnus , or night terrors .
because of his lack of sleep , he's suffered a psychotic break .
once that occurs , the subject can't discern what is real and what is not .
they begin to manifest a response .
how do you mean?
a patient may hurt themselves because they believe what they dream is real .
michael feels that something is after him , wanting to kill him .
and his self inflicted wounds are consistent with this fantasy .
the good news is that there is a procedure we can perform ... ... right here , which has had an overwhelming success rate .
ls it surgical?
no , not at all .
michael is placed in a sensory deprivation chamber .
he faces his fears and realizes there's nothing to fear .
tests .
michael hates the dark .
yeah .
that's the point .
ls there any other alternative?
aggressive medication coupled with counseling .
there are no guarantees .
meanwhile , michael might hurt himself again .
ray and i were just sitting there , having drinks ... ... and walsh starts fighting with ray ....
where are my flashlights?
lab's not done with them .
that's all you remember?
the words you're looking for are " thank you .
hey , kyle !
kyle , wait up !
i'm having a bad day , kyle .
i had a dead guy fall on me .
you want to tell me where you're going , huh?
kyle?
how about a pistola?
huh?
no .
wait here a minute .
okay , now what?
where's your car?
why?
i need a ride .
now !
yeah .
car's over here .
hey , man , you've been released into my custody .
kyle !
it's 5 : 35 , larry .
the sun sets in 20 minutes .
you've got 20 minutes to get me to the hospital .
we're almost set up .
it'll just be another 1 5 minutes .
where's the other doctor?
he had to get back upstate .
so you'll be doing this?
why did you come back?
do you know how long i've tried to get through to her?
her brother's always there and then the ghost .
a ghost?
you , man .
nobody in this town had a chance with her .
all she could think about was you .
i need you to sign these .
what are they?
standard consent and release of liability forms .
he'll be fine .
where are you taking me?
this isn't the way .
i'm not taking you to the hospital .
lay low for the judge .
i just want to help michael .
michael's gonna be fine .
they're putting him in a sensory dep tank .
gonna shut the lights out .
they're putting him in the dark?
gonna fix him ... ... stop him from becoming the next kyle walsh .
it's gonna be okay .
i'm gonna be watching you from the other room .
lf you put me in the dark , she'll get me .
it'll all be over soon , okay?
turn this car around now .
take me to michael .
what if i don't?
larry , don't look at her !

don't let her put michael in the dark .
i'm almost there .
hello , police?
now , michael , i'm going to need you to hold still .
okay?
there might be just a little sting .
