sheikh salameh was our target .
he ran a large terrorist faction that had taken out a number of american targets , including at least one of the embassy bombings ... that left 212 people dead mostly civilians .
an assassination was not an option .
he needed to appear to die of natural causes , to avoid violent repercussions , and even more bloodshed his base of operations was cyprus .
what we knew about him was that he was extremely dangerous , extremely paranoid , and he was planning a trip to beirut to see the family doctor .
i sent bishop in a couple of months ahead of me , to make contacts and get within striking distance of the sheikh .
i set him up at the commodore .
where all the flacks and the expatriates stayed .
his cover was as a photo journalist .
he was good .
he was talented .
he had a good eye .
probably had a photographymerit badge stuffed in a drawer at home .
it wasn't that much different from 'nam , actually , so it wasn't long ...
before he was right at home .
took him seven weeks ... but bishop found a way toget to the sheikh .
hi .
hi .
yeah , uh , tobacco , see , cigarettes
it's for the children , for god's sake .
fine .
okay , calm down .
calm down !
bishop delivered medical supplies ... to the refugee camp .
he'd negotiated a deal with a new contact in order to get closer to the sheikh's doctor .
take the antibiotics and the morphine ... straight to the doctor ; , the rest of the stuff , the hypos , the bandages
oh , fuck .
hey , what happened to the kid over here?
oh , he was trying to take the hill .
it's in the north end of the camp .
if they make it , they're clear into a safe zone where they can get medical supplies and food .
of course , they've got to make it back .
there we go , honey .
hi .
hi .
i'd like to come back and do a story on the doc .
maybe get something published for you .
for me?
yeah , let the world know what's goin 'on here .
well , i don't know , terry .
maybe we can work something out .
anyway , bishop did a " day in the life " spread on the doctor ... that we got printed in the times .
so , with that relationship intact , things looked good .
it's good .
then again , this was beirut .
we didn't know when the doctor was going to be giving the sheikh his physical , but it was our only opportunityto take him out .
so , i didn't have the usual time to butter him up , which means we needed twice the sex with half the foreplay .
hello?
muir has arrived .
huh?
can you get over here soon?
right .
okay .
good .
all right .
what's wrong?
uh , israeli troops .
movin 'into the bekaa valley .
mm .
where in the bekaa?
south end .
god , it's 5 : 30 .
with the roadblocks , you won't get there till noon .
yeah , so the shots won't be so pretty .
all right , i'm up .
what's so important?
hey , it's a new day .
far too early , you psycho .
what is it?
the sheikh ali salemeh , he's moving .
how?
speedboat from cyprus .
he's booked the top floor of the nebaa apartments for two weeks .
my god , you're hideous .
why do you even bother?
missed you , too .
what do you want?
flowers at 5 : 00 in the morning?
flowers would be nice .
but i'll settle for breakfast .
well , i got a good spot .
yeah?
yeah , taught the guy to make migas .
yeah .
migas?
mexican restaurant in beirut , huh?
i'm impressed .
suddenly , mexican doesn't sound so good to me .
this better be the best damn breakfast i ever had .
it's delicious .
you'll love it .
we have to make it to the end of the alley .
you're gonna make a beautiful corpse .
happy birthday , nathan .
you know langley has seven different birth dates for you?
well , they're all wrong .
i know .
it wasn't easy .
k. g. b. , mossad , also wrong .
fortunately , i was well trained .
tom , i'm speechless .
where the hell did you find something like this in beirut?
beirut?
diplomatic pouch , overnight from london .
got a new racket goin 'on here .
operation dinner out .
dinner out?
mm .
dinner out .
i'll remember that .
here we go .
how're we doing?
the sheikh's scheduled for a physical .
i made contact with his doctor , who is also his cousin .
that sounds right .
doctor's name is ahmad , works at a refugee camp ...
south of town .
i got to him through an aid worker .
blonde or brunette?
i didn't say it was a she .
is she cute?
just someone i used to get to the camp .
is she gonna be any further use to us?
not to us .
another piece of nasty business .
langley wants a backup .
okay?
they want me to liaise with the lebanese militia , just in case .
nathan , those guys are cowboys .
no .
not an option .
all the more reason to make sure we do it our way .
you're ten minutes late .
nathan , we're okay .
i just got hung up .
look , we got zero room for error here .
you're right .
you're right .
it won't happen again .
ahmad .
good to see you .
oh , how are you , sir?
i'm great .
listen , i have a friend i think you'd be interested in speaking with .
you good on time?
okay .
yes , okay .
hello , doctor .
fine .
may i?
how are you , sir .
please .
it's official business .
i'm afraid a bit unpleasant , but something you ought to see .
the doctor's father had been a politician , a diplomat of some note . and he and his wife had died a couple of years back , from co2 asphyxiation .
we have reason to believe that the death of your parents was not accidental .
are you saying ... they were murdered?
we know who did it .
i wanted to give you a chance , if you want it , to do something about this .
something i think would serve both of our interests .
i'm sorry .
it's like he wanted me to know .
what i did know was that if we weren't careful , she was going to cause the whole thing to come crashing down around us .
okay .
yeah .
good .
he's been with her every night .
yeah .
scotch .
wh what's wrong?
nothin '.
excuse me , sir?
mm .
see the gentleman at the bar?
would you get him a double of your cheapest scotch?
okay?
thank you .
who is it?
it's this guy , he , uh , he works at the embassy .
he helped me out with a passport problem .
monsieur , the gentleman here bought you a scotch .
good guy .
a really good guy .
terry .
it's terry , right?
that's right .
it's good to see you again , nathan .
i was just saying how you helped me out with that passport problem .
uh , elizabeth hadley , nathan muir .
pleased to meet you .
nice to meet you .
what you don't know is that he mentioned you at the embassy .
said he met a beautiful girl and he wanted to extend his stay now that's that's gotta be you , right?
well , you never know .
you want to join us?
ah well , maybe , just for a minute .
i don't want to be a third wheel .
so , what brings you to this part of the world?
well , i'm with an international aid organization .
oh .
how do you keep track of it all?
it all "?
i haven't been here that long , but it seems like nobody trusts anybody .
seventeen sects , all claiming their birthright here .
do you have a favorite?
our organization's neutral .
god , that must be nice , being neutral .
never having to take sides .
sleeping like a baby .
that's a simplistic way  please , don't defend me .
what?
no , no , she's right .
how do you sleep , elizabeth?
hey .
well , actually , i don't .
it's the shelling i can't quite get used to , you know?
all night .
well , it's more effective that way .
families at home .
greater chance for casualties .
and quite a lot of these shells , they seem to come from warships .
funny , too , now that i think about it .
the bombs , the guns , the bullets , the tanks , they all come from somewhere else , too uh , china , syria ,
iraq , iran the u. s.
this place is like " 31 flavors " something for everyone .
bad day at the office , nathan?
ah , sh you're right .
i apologize . jesus , here you are , kind enough to invite me to your table , and i start talking politics right off the bat .
mm .
i guess that's the curse of the job .
must be .
so , elizabeth , do you miss london?
it must be tough not to be able to return .
why should that concern you?
what are you talking about?
i don't know if she's mentioned , but she's not welcome at home .
parents won't talk to her , her brother and two sisters think she's crazy .
she's a fanatic .
stop it .
this is ridiculous .
yeah , you just met this guy , right?
no , please don't .
please , stay with your friend .
what the fuck are you doing?
exactly what you should have done your homework .
nathan , she set us up with ahmad .
she's just an asset , huh?
did it ever occur to you she might see you as an asset?
yes , it did , and i'm tellin 'you , you're wrong .
how'd you two meet?
did you mark her?
or was it the other way around?
did she get you to do you any favors?
you're out of line .
drop it .
it's under control .
oh !
how about him?
rajiq nabih .
you got him under control?
hezbollah .
she uses him to finance her camp , and he uses her for god knows what .
tell me i'm wrong , tom .
tell me you knew about him .
i don't know what the fuck you're doin '.
but my personal life is my business .
you stay out of it .
oh , like heck .
sure " terry .
i'll stay out of your personal life .
excusez moi .
uh , taxi .
taxi , s'll vous plait .
oui , madame .
am i getting played here?
huh?
jesus christ , you're such a  am i getting played?
oh , you're accusing me of lying to you?
what is it?
do you want the truth?
well , uh , fine .
i'm a fixer .
uh , fanatic .
how do you think i move so freely?
you know , i make deals .
provide introductions .
anything to try and help ... the people that i work with .
as much as i'd like to deny it , most times , those introductions have consequences .
why can't you go home?
why can't you go home?
why?
i put
why?
i was involved with , um , a , human rights group in london .
we bombed a building owned by the chinese government .
it was supposed to be empty , and it wasn't .
and i have to live with that .
fine .
well , that's me .
what about you?
y you can start small there .
your name .
you know my name .
your name .
terry .
tell me your real name , please .
terry .
jesus , you're pathetic .
she had worked both ends against the middle for so long ,
the middle decided to give up and go home .
the chinese , of course , had serious problems with her .
a lot of little ones .
one big one .
the london bombings claimed the life of the premier's nephew , and they don't tend to forget that kind of thing .
how well did you know hadley?
our paths crossed .
that's about it .
what was bishop's reaction to all this?
didn't bring it up .
so , neither did i.
i'm gonna try to get us some work in south america .
ever been to argentina?
you okay?
yes .
i am okay .
fuck .
okay .
halfa drop of this on the skin ... and he'll be dead within 12 hours .
you will use this stethoscope .
you will take the cap off , hold it to his chest to check his heart , and place the cap back on don't brush up against it .
got it?
yeah .
that's it .
tell me is it hard?
is what hard?
to take a life .
yeah .
the sheikh wants me to come at noon .
on friday .
which was just four long days away .
lntelligence showed us he was in the process ... of planning a major attack on the civilian sector of west beirut .
we were on the clock , and we knew this was ouronly chance .
so it was imperative that everything went according to plan .
so bishop baby sat the doctor , and the rest of us tried not to watch the water boil .
and to satisfy langley , i met with the lebanese militia , who were more than just a little excited about even the possibility ... of putting their bomb squad into action against the sheikh , in case the plan with the doctor failed .
monsieur .
bonjour .
the militia was purely a backup .
not a real option .
and then there was the waiting .
that's the worst part .
gives you too much time to consider , " what if?
my name's tom .
and then , on ...
thursday , the day before the sheikh 's physical , the druze and the party of god started a street war in south beirut .
she got antsy , and the water boiled over .
tom bishop on the phone .
yeah?
the sheikh wants them there within the hour .
so here we go .
nathan , the doc's not with me .
where the hell is he?
the amal retaliated and shelled the camp .
you let him go?
nathan
you let her take him?
on my way .
lebanese militia is not an option .
we let the sheikh get away , we are dead in the water .
no .
i can get him there .
just trust me .
get out of the way !
move !
ahmad , it's time .
i'm sorry .
we gotta go now .
fuck !
move !
hello?
it's muir .
where are we?
looks like they're packing up to go .
move !
move !
and?
could be an hour .
could be ten minutes .
get out of the way !
come on !
move !
move !
move !
move !
get out ofthe fucking way !
hello?
okay .
okay .
good luck , ahmad .
ahmad , we gotta go .
you okay?
yes .
yes .
yes .
you okay?
okay .
thank you .
come on , ahmad .
come on .
the destruction was a little more extensive ... than anyone anticipated .
our lebanese friends were a little insecure about this being their first big mission , so they packed up the car with enough semtex to blowup half of beirut .
it was a tough deal , but i figured bishop could handle it .
i didn't see him again until a week later , when we were scheduled to fly out of there for karachi .
that was the last time i saw him .
happy?
seventy four casualties , an apartment block leveled , one dead terrorist
yeah , happy .
we have some fucked up barometer for success , don't we?
let's take a walk .
i'm not going with you .
hooked up with another op .
probably for the best .
is this about her?
no .
be sure you're doing it for the right reasons , tom .
yeah .
i'm done with your reasons , nathan .
i'm done with you .
i'm not ending up like you .
good luck .
good luck .
lizzy?
yes?
i'm on my way .
i've got to go brief the white house .
we'll finish this up at 07 00 tomorrow .
the files you requested , sir .
ah , thank you .
wait !
you can't go in there .
i'll get back to you .
it's all right .
you can't do this .
i'm due at the white house .
he's one of ours .
troy , do you remember when we could tell the good guys from the bad guys?
all this ... it was about something , wasn't it?
yes .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
oh , forgot my smokes .
i'll get them , sir .
you're aware this is now a non smoking facility , sir?
feels good to break a rule now and then .
good morning .
thomas quinn .
mitch alford , please .
nathan muir .
one moment , please .
mitch , i got nathan muir on the line .
want to take it?
thanks .
hey , nathan .
what can i do for you?
who's this?
she was his wife .
this guy and his fucking wives .
she stayed in korea while he did two tours in south america .
the second op with harry duncan was real sensitive shit .
muir worked with duncan?
this should work for both of them .
liquidate everything , mitch .
stocks , t bills money markets , the works .
shouldn't we discuss this?
no .
i don't care about the penalties .
i want to have access to it now .
nathan , save for a rainy day .
look , i know what i'm doing .
1 7 1 2 4 4 8 2 9 2 ;
first maritime of grand cayman .
grand cayman?
that's it .
thanks , mitch .
this is harker , i need to find out if there were any calls ... made to hong kong since this morning .
the whole building .
hi .
hi there .
mislaid my pass .
i'll take a look upstairs .
no problem .
get a load of this .
what?
he consolidated his international trading account .
he what?
sent them to a bank in grand cayman .
get me his account balance .
right .
yeah?
harry , it's muir .
here's a list of the hong kong calls you requested .
embassy .
that's his cell phone .
hong kong herald .
that's andrew unger's fucking office .
you still have contact with that official at the power company?
yeah .
yeah , deng .
why?
yeah , this is harker .
i'll hold .
where can i fax you this under the radar?
kowloon marriott .
what the hell is going on here , muir?
you gotta trust me on this , harry .
why should i trust you?
jesus , you recommended boy scout to me in the first place .
call me on my cell .
muir?
what's going on , unger?
i'm looking for my badge .
i don't understand it
where'smuir?
looks like he's gone for the day , sir .
what?
how much longer?
print them out and send them up .
yeah?
what now?
did you get my fax?
yes .
i see an op requiring three months of prep .
bishop prepped it before he piggybacked sideshow .
so , what , we're going to ask him for help?
he's going to be dead in six hours .
no , he's got a friend on the inside .
check the roster for sideshow .
well , i'll be damned .
tran .
he's got all the schematics for the prison .
what do we need deng for?
thirty minutes ofcomplete blackout at su chou .
and harry?
yeah?
give me bottom dollar .
yeah?
deng wants 500, 000 yuan for the power out at su chou .
no way .
tell him a hundred " k " , and i'll pay in dollars .
well , he won't risk it for less than 300 , but he will take dollars .
five years ago , it would have cost 20 grand .
five years ago , deng would not have had to bribe ... ten employees , two supervisors , a local politician all of whom stand to lose their lives if they get caught .
come on , muir .
it's not like it was your money .
tell 'im 282 grand in the grand cayman account and that's it .
okay .
it's a done deal .
morning , gladys .
oh , if the wife calls , tell her i'll be upstairs .
good morning , gentlemen .
director wilson .
good morning .
have a seat .
i , uh , found some extra stuff on bishop .
i don't think it's relevant , but if you want to see it
harker , you want to go ahead?
there are a couple of things that need to be cleared up .
about bishop?
no , about you , muir .
about the past 24 hours .
mr. muir has been working against us from the start .
what are you talking about?
i've done nothing but cooperate .
cooperate?
have i withheld anything?
certainly the fact that harry duncan tipped you off ... to bishop's situation before you even arrived here yesterday .
yet you chose to play dumb with us .
why?
okay .
then maybe you'd like to tell us about the calls you placed ... to duncan from andrew unger's office last night .
harry duncan's a friend  aren't they all .
we were discussing a personal matter .
harry duncan's gone missing .
oh , yeah?
well , good for harry .
he deserves some time away .
with your $282, 000?
muir transferred that amount to a grand cayman account yesterday .
as of an hour ago , it's gone .
you want to accuse me of something?
accuse me .
maybe the payoff went to ...
digby gibson when you tipped off the press .
troy?
leave digger out of this .
his paper's a front .
he's ml 6's man in hong kong .
anything else , harker?
yes , sir .
yesterday , imagery analysis delivered a file ... requested by muir's secretary to your office .
did you receive that file , sir?
i don't remember seeing it .
it was returned at 03 00 this morning .
all right , give it to me .
thank you .
is this china?
muir?
i believe it is , sir , and i think it would behoove mr. muir ... to tell us exactly what $282, 000 has bought him there .
muir?
it's kind of difficult to explain .
i think you better tell us everything .
i've been using company resources for personal benefit .
for the past year , i've been routing one of our satellites ... over some retirement property that i'm thinking about buying .
what the hell is that?
harker , let me see that .
because of the changing weather patterns and the erosion ... that's occurring along the coastline of the beaches , and the fact that it's my life savings ,
i just wanted to be sure .
sorry .
i believe i'll sit in for the rest of this .
aiken , where did you leave off yesterday?
beirut , sir .
we still don't know how hadley wound up in a chinese prison .
should we go off the record with this , sir?
no .
let's get on with this .
after the bombing , hadley was a concern .
not only to middle east ops but to bishop 's life .
so i brokered a trade with the chinese government , using hadley in exchange for a u. s. diplomat convicted of espionage .
and she was flown to a high security prison near su chou , eastern china .
the place was cleared out and a " dear john " saying they were through ... was forged and left for bishop to find .
it appears you underestimated bishop's feelings for her .
yeah , i underestimated it .
and you took it upon yourself to do this deal ... and you were alone in this .
yeah .
just me .
muir's secretary is on the phone .
your secretary's on the phone , line one .
yeah?
i've got commander wiley .
okay , connect us .
commander wiley , sir .
fax received .
what's the verdict?
we're on for tonight .
roger , sir .
understand .
operation dinner out is a go .
confirm?
correct .
dinner out is a go .
dinner out's a go?
helluva way to speak to your wife .
why do you think they keep dumping him?
how did bishop find out where she was?
couldn't have been too hard .
small world , people talk .
a white face in a chinese prison stands out .
he's well trained .
should've known he'd find out .
any other questions?
yeah , one .
if you'd known he was going after her , would you have told us?
no .
do we edit the transcript or let it stand?
the agency can't be responsible for some crazy thing bishop did on his own .
i'm sorry ... about bishop .
so am i.
we done here?
nondisclosure agreement .
aren't you going to read it?
read it a thousand times .
aiken , would you escort ...
mr. muirfrom the building?
dinner with his wife?
why?
he said he had four wives .
i'm changing phones .
there was one in germany .
his first wife was korean .
and peggy , that's three .
he was only married once .
this is black hawk one , we're inbound .
operation dinner out accomplished .
what did you say?
nothing .
just that we're on our way home , sir .
no .
operation what?
dinner out , sir .
who are the others?
here it is .
patricia lemour , sandra harrisand peggy dye , all agents or civilian assets .
they were all cover wives .
then who was he talking to?
there's been an incident in china .
oh , jesus christ .
spent the last year rocky mountain way
couldn't get much higher
out to pasture think it's safe to say
time to open fire
and we don't need the ladies
crying 'cause the story's sad
'cause the rocky mountain way
is better than the way we had
whoa
well , he's telling us this and he's telling us that

playing it play by play
time to change the batter
and we don't need the ladies
crying 'cause the story's sad
