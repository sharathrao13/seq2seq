25 . 000
this is the story of a squad of marines , a rifle squad .
i'm corporal robert dunne , a member of that squad .
we were at guadalcanal , and when it was secure we were pulled out for rest , refitting , replacements and retraining .
the marine corps is long on training and retraining ... let that go .
after the canal , we were sent to camp paekakariki in new zealand .
here we received our replacements , marines from stateside , a long way from stateside , 8, 000 miles .
i can see you're a man who knows how to live .
solid comfort .
solid malaria .
malaria , huh?
contagious?
no , not this week .
you can stay .
nice place you got here .
regazzi's my name , benny regazzi .
bob dunne .
i'm duty nco today .
great .
meet my friends .
this big guy is " handsome " dan shipley .
hi .
what a physique !
the girls see him and faint .
he comes through this , i'll make him a movie star !
those two guys , flynns .
that's eddie and that's frank .
hi , eddie .
hello , bob .
they don't drink .
i got their beer ration .
and georgie hellenopolis , an irishman .
hello , sport .
where did you get those cards?
off your sack on the ship .
why?
they're mine , that's why .
i've seen lots in those bags that aren't .
come on , give me .
" semper fi " , mac .
hey !
leave them .
it happens 20 times a day .
you know where those guys come from?
philadelphia , the city of brotherly love .
by the way , who's the squad leader?
sergeant stryker .
what's he like?
you'll find out .
i've been in new zealand two hours and already they're clamming up on me .
i hope he knows his stuff .
maybe we'll get liberty .
we ain't replacements any more .
where is he?
where's the sergeant?
he's here .
well , what do you know?
stryker .
hello , thomas .
thought you were in the first .
i was .
sit down .
just sit down , thomas , anywhere .
my name is stryker , sergeant john m stryker .
you're gonna be my squad , a rifle squad .
corporal dunne , charlie bass and myself .
you'll learn from us .
in boot camp you learned out of a book .
here you gotta remember the book and learn things that haven't been printed .
you gotta learn right and fast .
any man that doesn't want to cooperate , i'll make him wish he hadn't been born .
before i'm through with you , you're gonna move and think like one man .
if you don't , you'll be dead .
you guys have had a nice easy day .
i hope you enjoyed it because it's the last one you'll get for a long time .
you joined the marines to fight and you'll get your chance .
i'll show you how .
if i can't teach you one way , i'll teach you another .
but i'll get the job done .
the skipper of this outfit is captain joyce .
platoon leader is lieutenant baker .
platoon sergeant is sergeant wright .
any questions?
that's all .
10, 000 sergeants in this corps and i draw stryker !
you knew this guy before?
yeah .
we were stationed together in china .
twice he kept me from promotion .
turned me in once .
30 days i got .
he was a sergeant major then .
must have done something to get busted to three stripes .
what did he turn you in for?
for ...
that's not important !
what's important is that he turned me in !
maybe he didn't write the manual , but you can bet he can recite it backwards !
it's probably tattooed on his chest .
front and back , mac .
say , isn't your name al thomas?
yeah .
weren't you a fighter?
just in the marines .
runner up in the heavyweight division .
tell him who you were runner up to .
stryker .
lucky punch .
meet your new manager .
tell him why you lost your stripes .
my natural dislike for you is gradually developing into a great hate .
don't let this guy do your thinking .
you'll get a square deal from stryker .
you bet .
square deal .
i'm looking forward to the first time he and i come head to head off duty .
hey , take it easy with that hand , champ !
saddle up !
all right , take a break .
take a break .
how does your squad look?
see me in about six months .
conway !
i was checking the records .
your father was colonel sam conway .
what if he was?
i was with him ten months ago .
he was my co before he got killed .
one of the best officers and finest men i ever served under .
i thought if you ...
thanks .
i'll keep it in mind .
for that , you sleep with your rifle .
it was an accident .
nobody in this outfit drops their rifle .
fall in !
all right , saddle up .
pick it up .
sometimes i don't know which i hate worse , him or the nips .
your father was a good marine .
until ten months ago .
you shipped in when he was killed .
i shipped in because i was expected to .
in war the men of my family join the marines .
i'm the last conway , so here i am .
he'd be proud that you're carrying on the tradition .
not my father .
he'd have expected me to find some soft duty somewhere .
in fact , he told me so .
i don't get it .
i embarrassed my father .
i wasn't tough enough for him .
too soft .
no guts " was the phrase he used .
he wanted me to be like stryker .
the finest man i ever served under .
i bet they got along just fine .
both with ramrods strapped on their backs .
i'm a civilian , not a marine .
they're not going to strap one on mine .
i'm in here strictly for tradition .
that the only reason?
yeah .
why?
nothing ...
stryker knows his business .
so did jack the ripper .
knock off the skylarking .
you're in the wrong column .
left foot close in there .
look alive !
choynski , you're all left feet !
choynski !
what do you think you're doing?
running the bayonet course , sir .
not in this league .
yes , sir .
your men are pretty ragged , stryker .
yes , sir .
that ought to take some starch out of stryker .
his boys didn't do so well .
hanging him up between those poles , we'd do a lot better .
choynski !
ok , so i'm left handed .
on guard .
give me your rifle .
what is this?
you can't learn the easy way , you'll learn the hard way .
make a thrust .
without a scabbard?
you heard me .
you mean this way?
yeah , like this !
you get the idea?
corpsman !
all right , saddle up .
we'll do it again .
pick it up .
you're the only unkissable guy in camp .
this thing hurts .
it ain't funny .
no dame's going to come near a mouth like this .
don't worry , i got the scoop .
no liberty for three months .
you got time .
three months?
how did you get that?
i got spies everywhere .
they ought to throw the book at stryker for doing this .
they won't .
they'll give him a citation for teaching us to be good marines .
choynski !
they tell me you're going to live .
you were lucky today .
someone had been instructing you that didn't like you , you might not have been .
you better put in a little homework on that bayonet course .
somebody who didn't like me?
i wonder what he does to the guys he hates .
365 days in a year and i gotta pick this one to nick myself !
you need a blow torch on your stubble .
look who's putting out the scuttlebutt .
no liberty , he says !
somebody made a mistake .
you got no kick coming .
you have , so don't go turning your back .
will we take hollywood with them physiques !
first platoon !
that's for me !
here , wright , any mail for stryker?
no .
it's going to be rugged again tonight .
he won't solve his problems with whiskey .
what would you do if your wife left with your kid?
after five years i'd forget it .
stryker's not much on forgetting .
sorry , no letter for you .
i know it .
you know ten year olds .
there could be a thousand reasons why he didn't write .
a million .
cut it out .
cut what out?
brushing me .
the kid's all right .
maybe mary influenced him not to .
that she wouldn't do .
of course not .
stryker , you're a very unusual character .
can this be love?
you know what i mean .
a lot of guys wouldn't see that a woman needs a husband who's not always away .
a woman wants a home and a guy to come in and out on time every day .
you can tell me to shut up .
if you can't talk to me , who can?
don't do it , just for once , don't do it .
do what?
don't start out to get blind , staggering , stinking , falling down drunk .
nobody starts out to get blind , staggering , stinking , falling down drunk .
some do .
why not leave half your dough with me?
you got an old maid's failings .
you worry .
don't try to follow me tonight or i'll put a dent in that ugly head of yours .
ready?
just a minute .
what's up?
nothing .
benny didn't strip his m1 fast enough for stryker , so he turned him in .
they cancelled his liberty .
perhaps our sergeant hasn't got a heart of gold after all , but he certainly is ...
you talk too much .
you think i restricted flynn for my own amusement?
the punishment's unreasonable , to cancel his liberty for a minor mistake .
i'm gonna tell you something , conway .
i'm gonna tell all of you .
i'm gonna make it simple so you'll all understand it .
they handed me you guys as a present , a regular easter basket .
they told me to get you into shape so you can handle a piece of this war .
that's what i'm gonna do and that means i'm gonna tell you what to do every day , how to button your buttons and when to blow your noses .
if you do something i don't like i'm gonna jump and when i land it'll hurt .
i'll ride you until you can't stand up .
when you do , you'll be marines .
flynn stays here .
extra hard product of a hard school .
tough luck , flynn .
if my brother doesn't go , i'm not going .
shut up !
who are you telling to shut up?
you !
let's go before we all lose our liberty .
i wanna see those wellington babes .
how do you feel , boy?
like a little bird with feathers on it .
don't fly away , little bird .
i can't .
i'm still in the egg .
beautiful , beautiful !
i wanna dance .
you're gonna sit down .
yes , ma'am , tennessee , that's where i come from .
the greatest state in the union .
they call it the volunteer state .
right there is where i'm from .
smithville , tennessee , what a town !
these are all my cousins on my mama's side and these are on my papa's side .
we got the best tobacco there is , too .
more fertiliser comes from tennessee than any other place in the world .
listen to that band !
zombies !
they're all dead .
maybe they like music that way here .
or don't know any other kind .
i'm talking these boys into a session .
maybe they don't have it in them .
after i'm through , they will .
they're breaking my heart .
beautiful , beautiful , beautiful !
there is a happy man .
wait until tomorrow .
don't be a killjoy , dance .
i'll watch him .
i'm not much on dancing .
you might try just this once .
no , thanks .
pete's my name , pete conway .
allison .
hello , allison .
hello , pete .
you're warm .
want to sit down?
no .
i don't want to lose you .
cutting in .
shove off , mac .
what would you say if i suggested we get some air?
i'd say i'm not supposed to leave the club with servicemen , but to you i'd say yes .
now what?
we know all about each other .
you'll be missing your train .
i'll float back on thin air .
don't do that .
you might catch cold .
funny , i've just met you and i feel i've known you all my life .
i feel that way , too .
ten thousand miles away .
not now .
i wanna see you again , every time i get liberty .
i'll be here .
allison ...
yes? ... l'm glad i met you tonight .
the train ...
i know .
i'll walk you to the station .
i can get a taxi from there .
no , i'll walk you home .
no .
you might miss your train .
i might not see you again for a long time .
any time i get liberty , she says , just call her up .
man , what a barmaid !
i'll finish the war right here .
drink any more and you probably will !
new zealand ain't got rats because they killed them all with that whiskey !
we'll drink worse before we get through .
they may bury me at sea tomorrow , but tonight i got that nice , warm feeling .
i got a great future for the next two hours .
you're bleeding !
lipstick !
hey , fellas , look what i found !
hey , sports ... ... look .
boy , he's really carrying a load !
gyrene !
hey , mac , you're a little off your course .
well , what do you know !
stryker .
he's sure a mess .
now i know what happened to those stripes .
come on .
shore patrol .
that's what it is .
give me a hand .
you're going to help him?
if he cut my mother's throat five minutes ago , i wouldn't let them get him .
what a break !
he's all set to drop two stripes and shore patrol shows up .
but look what he done to me !
don't tell me he kissed you .
that's a great one !
did i tell you about the guy on a train and the funniest thing happened ...
i don't know why you're helping him .
i'll take care of it .
where did you come from?
never mind .
he don't need you guys .
how do you like that?
he must follow stryker like a little dog .
what do you care?
at least he took him off our hands .
a day after our leave , we drew a 22 mile hike over terrain carefully selected .
all uphill , and it was a weary bunch of marines who pitched tents that night and gratefully folded themselves inside .
do you believe in love at first sight?
all kinds .
i never did before but i sure do now .
why do you have to tell me now?
because i'm thinking about it now .
i'm gonna marry that girl .
what girl?
the girl i met last night .
you'll feel better in the morning .
i couldn't feel any better than i do right now .
i've been thinking , why do men get married during a war?
don't know .
it's the worst time .
i fooled around but i never thought about marriage .
i know a lot of girls back in the states but ... ... i think it's because when you get out here you're close to things .
you realise way down inside , no matter how much you try not to think about it , that maybe something's got your number on ... ... and you want to leave a bit of yourself behind .
doesn't matter if it's a boy or a girl , just so long as you won't be forgotten .
there'll be someone who'd never have lived if it hadn't been for you .
am i right?
i think i'm right .
hey , conway , got a pass?
i have .
all right , hop in .
i'll give you a lift .
i hear you got a girl in town .
what if i have?
they say she's a very nice girl .
they talk too much .
are you serious about her?
with things the way they are , this is no time to start getting serious with a girl .
don't know how long you're gonna be here or when you'll be back again .
don't even know how long you'll live .
if it's in the line of duty , you can tell me to do something and i'll do it .
as for my personal life , keep your hands off .
your father would've said it .
i wouldn't have listened .
you never did .
how do you know?
he told me .
what did he say?
i'll tell you .
he said i was a disappointment , right?
he said i wouldn't be able to stand up for myself , right?
you're doing the talking .
no , my father is .
every time you open your mouth , he's talking .
every thought you think is his .
it's as though he's at my shoulder .
but he didn't always say or think the right thing .
you're gonna find that out when the time comes .
until then leave me alone .
you want a lift or not?
yeah , sure .
what's the matter?
nothing .
why?
you've hardly said a word .
you're right .
i've been thinking .
about us?
myself .
that's selfish .
honey , do you think i'm a brave man?
what a funny question to ask .
well , do you?
i don't know .
why?
i've got to prove something to someone .
who?
you don't know him .
he's dead now .
yes , pete , i think you're brave .
that helps .
you don't know how much that helps .
let's not talk about it any more .
we should have been talking about ourselves all this time , what's going to happen to us .
what do you want to happen?
i want to marry you .
i want that , too .
funny , we barely know each other .
we see each other for what seems only moments .
and yet ...
i know what you mean .
choynski , not going to the wedding?
no .
i'd better get a transfer .
i can't learn this bayonet business .
i'm all thumbs .
on guard .
no , sarge , not again !
i'm not well from the last time .
on guard !
play that thing again .
you lead .
what?
you lead !
shift your weight .
left , left !
there .
keep it up .
you'll get the knack of it .
practise that about a half an hour every day .
hey , sarge !
i got it !
i haven't been in church since i was 14 .
kissing the bride's a great invention .
sure makes me homesick .
what's the matter?
he looks the same .
how do you expect him to look?
married , wrinkled , worried , like me .
44 hours and 34 minutes left .
go !
excuse me , sports .
here's your wedding present from the gang .
you've all been wonderful .
are you sure you've got the right guy?
i'm sure .
come on , get going !
" sempre felice " , mac !
keep the situation well in hand , pete !
we got 44 hours and 33 minutes .
what are we gonna do?
al , if i was a girl , i'd marry you .
knock it off !
i've had a hard day .
what am i doing?
44 hours and 32 minutes .
that isn't very long , is it?
no , not long at all .
i wonder how many other people have had 44 hours and 32 minutes .
lots i guess .
we'll make it seem a long time .
years .
shall i open it?
sure , go ahead .
they're in a hurry !
others were in a hurry .
the order said move out and the marines moved out .
11 days at sea .
destination?
only the top brass knew .
though , of course , scuttlebutt knew the answer , a hundred answers , all wrong .
boat squad ... halt , one , two !
dismissed !
too bad you couldn't see her again .
you didn't get long .
we knew it might happen .
i'll be back .
i've got to believe that .
sure .
we'll all be back .
gangway !
that's no way to carry a flag , regazzi .
i've got to teach you everything .
now watch this ...
what are you gonna do with this , benny?
i'm gonna put that up in tokyo , right in the middle of times square .
there isn't any times square in tokyo .
there will be when i get there .
now that's the way to fold a flag , with the blue field showing .
what do you know !
you got my shirt !
it's my shirt !
i'm telling you , it's my shirt !
it's my shirt !
here , fellas .
you'd better quit fighting so much .
if you don't , one of you's apt to get hurt .
corpsman !
corpsman !
what's that?
relax .
it's the navy clearing its throat .
sure don't sound like no squirrel gun .
i hope they practise real good .
what island do you think we're aiming at?
we'll get word .
here it is .
it looks like a pork chop .
what's its name?
tarawa .
never heard of it .
it's the wrong place .
it's part of an atoll called tarawa atoll .
this particular island is called betio .
don't ask me how you spell it .
you'll have to stick your faces into it but you don't have to spell it .
this is red beach three .
that's us .
what have they got there?
everything .
this island's held by a special naval landing force .
that means japanese marines .
they're dug in and they're mean .
they'd just as soon die as stick a nickel in a jukebox , but that's all right .
let the other guy die for his country .
you'll live for yours .
what's the matter?
nothing .
get over there .
i can hear him .
get over there .
i don't want anybody hurt because you didn't listen .
schoolteacher , do me some homework .
what's your problem , son?
put down 5, 000 .
scuttlebutt says that's how many nips are on that rock .
the navy fired 1, 000 tons of shells .
don't forget the fly fly boys .
those b 24s have really been working them over .
now add the tons of explosives , divide it by the nips and get the answer .
maybe we'll be back for noon chow .
don't figure that way .
the navy and the fly fly boys unloaded plenty on the canal before we went in .
when we got ashore there were still a lot of those lemon coloured guys waiting .
only way that island was taken was by putting marines on the beach .
you've heard the naval foray's a waste of time and metal .
stryker knows better .
who cut you in on this conversation?
you say when i can and can't talk?
just when you can't talk to me .
knock it off , conway .
i've had enough of your " hardbitten sergeant " attitude .
you're so big everybody's been afraid to take a punch at you .
i'm not !
cool off !
forget that pencil and paper routine and worry about staying alive on that beach .
don't expect any soft touch !
" now hear this " !
all troops report to your debarking stations !
all right , men , sound off when your name's called .
now hear this , there'll be no movies tonight !
the place is opened up for business .
missed !
maybe they're firing blanks .
maybe a two headed kid's aiming .
maybe this is just manoeuvres .
get out now .
we're crossing the line of departure .
lock and load !
good luck , sarge !
charlie , give me a hand here !
lieutenant , hit the deck !
how is it?
i got hit !
corpsman !
you'll be all right .
they got us pinned down !
we can't get over these logs !
i'm going while i can !
stay here , kid !
we're gonna be killed here .
i'd like to get at them !
why rush?
this is a nice place .
they got the lieutenant !
they'll get all of us if we don't move .
we are like fish in a barrel lying here .
did we train to take it lying down?
sarge , do something about it !
stay where you are until i tell you .
you gotta get us out of here !
if you're nervous count your toes .
i'll do the masterminding around here .
where's lieutenant baker?
machine gunned .
is your squad all right?
all but one .
what's holding us down?
that bunker , an old power plant .
all these bombs and they're still killing us .
smoke , sir?
thanks .
i've sent for flame throwers to assist .
your squad will support .
follow me !
you heard !
move out and stay down !
we've gotta silence that bunker !
request naval gunfire be lifted on target areas , coordinates ... ... two four six zero sugar tare .
over .
roger and out .
flame throwers out !
demolition in !
demolition out !
shipley !
give me a hand with this pack .
throw it !
move out !
get him out of there !
there goes one of your nine .
now we got tanks .
better late than never .
come on !
corpsman !
corpsman !
this way !
don't wait .
they'll find me .
keep going .
hit 'em for me .
find stryker .
stick with him .
he's good people .
tell him i ...
i'd like to know where the rest of the squad went .
what's this place?
whatever it is it ain't healthy !
let's go !
that was close .
next time don't be in such a hurry .
you're across , ain't you?
across what?
to where?
i'm running low on ammo .
i am too .
forgot about that .
we gotta get some more .
i'll go .
wait !
pick a number from one to six .
two .
five .
you're both wrong .
that guy kills me .
thomas better hurry !
how about some bandoliers , mac?
help yourself .
how are things going up front?
pretty rough .
keep it coming .
good luck .
is that coffee?
it sure is .
do you want some?
do i want some , he says !
i haven't had any joe since we left the ship .
you mortarmen sure live the life of riley here .
here you are .
beautiful !
where's thomas?
probably dead .
no , not that guy .
let's get out of here !
can i have some for my buddies?
sure .
break out your canteen .
tell me , how's everything been going?
couldn't be better , mac .
oh , this is the life !
come and get it , you guys !
ammo and fresh hot joe !
hellenopolis !
bass !
hey , greek !
hey , greek !
what kepts you , thomas?
where's bass?
gutted .
no ammo .
what kept you , sports?
major crowe , sir .
jim?
how you doing?
" it's tough going , dave " .
i've committed every man .
we're dug in and staying .
good .
i've been getting reports all day that the nips are slipping in to your front .
if it's " banzai " tonight , target area 2 41 is a hot spot .
what outfit have you got there?
joyce and stryker .
pass the word they gotta dig in and stay put .
no noise or movement .
don't risk anybody unless you have to .
hold on until we get more men there .
yes , sir .
major crowe says the nips have been filtering into these tank traps .
disperse your squad along this section .
tell your men there's to be no smoking , no moving or unnecessary talking .
if they find out how thin we are , they can get to the beach .
that's a platoon area .
all i got's a beat up squad , short three men .
couldn't you ...?
can i give you three men?
the battalion can't give the whole company three replacements .
your squad is covering the hottest spot in the line .
if it's an attack tonight they'll strike you first .
they want to know our disposition .
i repeat , your men are not to move .
aye , aye , sir .
stryker , we're going to hold this line .
aye , aye , sir .
good luck .
all right , saddle up .
follow me .
everybody go !
drop off at intervals , two man foxholes .
we're gonna be spread out thin tonight .
don't give away your position or strength .
you flynns stay here , and no quarrels .
dunne and smith , drop out here .
no gab tonight !
you and harris here !
come on , conway .
corpsman !
listen .
corpsman !
that's a marine .
corpsman !
stryker !
get down and stay down !
you had your orders !
somebody's wounded !
quiet .
let's get him !
stay down !
it may be an old jap trick .
they pulled it on the canal .
it doesn't sound like a jap to me .
i don't care .
you'll tip our position .
stryker !
it's bass !
how many japs know your name?
you know his voice .
shut up .
aren't you human at all?
a friend of yours may be dying !
knock it off !
this is what my father taught you .
be a great marine , be tough .
sit here if you want .
i'm getting him .
the only way you'll stop me is to kill me .
that's just what i'll do !
stryker !
stryker !
sarge !
stryker !
please , sarge !
tarawa was officially declared secure at 13 . 30 on the fourth day of battle .
the replacements came ashore , our wounded were cared for and the assault troops were relieved .
how am i doing , chaplain?
god has been good to you .
you're going home .
per istam sanctam unctionem , et suam piisimam , indulgeat tibi dominus " quidquid deliquisti .
amen " .
somebody beat me to it .
skipper gave out some news .
part of it's good , part of it's bad .
they found hellenopolis .
he's dead .
he was a good greek .
choynski , soames and bass are on a hospital ship stateside bound .
i wish i was with them .
let's get cleaned up .
wash out those dungarees and let's look like marines .
you too , thomas .
dunne .
yeah?
i got a couple of bottles of sake in my gear .
give it to the squad .
right .
tell them you got it off a dead nip .
why don't you break down a little?
you got it off a dead nip .
aye , aye .
what's eating you?
know what stryker plans tomorrow?
another squad problem and i'm so tired of problems !
i'm tired of stryker !
i'm also tired of beautiful hawaii .
me , too .
hey , champ , what do you think of beautiful hawaii?
i don't want to talk about it .
clamming up again , ever since tarawa .
why the silence?
knock it off !
hi !
you got room for me?
what do you know !
you got time off for good behaviour?
yeah .
where were you?
pearl harbor?
yeah , nice place .
pretty nurses .
i'll give somebody $5 to shoot me in the foot .
i'll do it for $2 . 50 .
you're too willing !
some replacements out here assigned to our squad .
we build up the joint and they come and live in it .
this is stein and fowler and mchugh .
he's fowler .
mike mchugh , from cedar rapids to see this war's over in a hurry .
how old are you?
nineteen .
how old?
well , eighteen ... going on eighteen .
we heard that the squad leader's tough .
there are rumours to that effect .
tough sergeants roll off my knife !
you're gonna find your first few days with sergeant stryker very interesting .
you new men come with me .
attention !
charlie !
how are you?
certified fit for duty , so the medics say .
good .
the replacements came up with me .
they get younger all the time .
or we're getting older .
or both .
i can stand having you back .
i can stand being back .
what happened to the squad , besides the greek , shipley and thomas?
choynski ...
thomas?
he never got a scratch .
i was sure he got it .
why?
when we got stuck in a trench he went back to get ammo .
never came back .
how long between the time he went back and you got overrun?
about 40 minutes .
40 minutes?
stay here .
thomas !
yeah?
outside .
what's that about?
don't ask me .
i haven't any spies .
that's far enough .
what's this about?
just that i hate your guts !
get up .
you doped off and got one of my men killed and one of them bayoneted !
you haven't had enough .
get up !
stryker ...
attention !
all right , break it up .
what's your name?
sergeant stryker .
able company , sir .
and you?
pfc thomas .
able company , sir .
this may take some explaining before a court martial .
help that man up .
you'll need medical attention .
i'll be ok , sir .
that's debatable .
you know it's not permissible for an nco to strike a man?
yes , sir .
who struck the first blow?
colonel , there wasn't any first blow struck exactly .
a simultaneous explosion perhaps?
judo , sir .
the sergeant was showing me how to break a judo hold .
no more judo exhibitions .
understand , sergeant?
aye , aye , sir .
at least you're no stool pigeon .
wait a minute , stryker .
i'm wrong , dead wrong .
i know it .
i doped off for some coffee , but i didn't think a few minutes mattered .
it did !
i know that now , but i didn't then .
it's killing me .
i can't sleep .
a hundred times i wanted to tell you , tell somebody .
i ...
i liked that greek ...
i'd do anything for him .
if i could i'd change him for me right now .
i think you would .
guys make mistakes but every one we make , a stack of chips goes with it .
we make a mistake and some guy don't walk away !
for evermore he don't walk away .
i guess all we can do is just take it ... ... and hope we don't make the same mistake again .
i won't .
let's get back .
mail call !
first platoon .
a letter from my wife after 18 months .
know where she is?
in england , entertaining troops .
entertaining troops?
why isn't she here entertaining me?
i'm a troop .
they're all such nice boys .
there's a lieutenant here ... " a lieutenant !
when i get back she'll need standing up for a month !
i put on muscle lately !
darling , this is a funny way for a man to find out he's a father , but you are .
it happened the day before yesterday , just in time for breakfast .
he's a boy and looks beautiful like me and intelligent like you .
i should have told you it was going to happen , but i didn't want to worry you .
i don't know what to call him .
we never discussed that .
i'm a father !
hey , i'm a father !
let's see !
i'm a father !
all right , let's fall in !
come on !
finally we got our leave .
ten days in honolulu .
all of us were out on the town .
all except stryker .
he was still the same .
lonesome?
drift .
whiskey .
two?
please .
ok .
thanks .
a drink'll be good .
i'm tired .
it's been a rough day ...
knock it off !
i'm sorry , sergeant .
right .
thanks .
65 cents for a drink .
it's too much .
they cheat servicemen .
we could drink cheaper at my house .
don't throw your arm out of joint .
thanks for the drink .
i didn't mean to make too much buzzing in your ear .
it's all right , finish your drink .
i didn't mean to sound so tough .
i know .
you're just unhappy .
me , too .
my name's mary .
the long arm of coincidence , or something .
her name , too .
that invitation still hold?
make yourself comfortable .
i'll fix us a drink .
oh , dear !
well , i can get us some more in a jiffy .
i see .
will a sawbuck do it?
go on , take it .
it's only paper .
well , i'll be right back .
i hope this is your brand .
any brand is mine .
she says she's hungry .
he .
advise him against joining the marines .
mummy's fixing you something .
her boy'll be quiet while she has company .
knock it off ...
where's his father?
gone .
well , i guess into each life a little rain must fall .
there are a lot tougher ways of making a living than going to war .
you know about babies .
yeah , i know about babies .
so long , mac .
wait !
i can't spend it on a coral reef .
you're a very good man .
you'll get odds on that in the marines .
so long .
so long , sergeant .
i'll pray for you .
let's not get religion .
i'll pray for you , sergeant !
good luck .
you got a lot of bloodhound in you , charlie , but you can call off the dogs .
i'm smarter than i was 30 minutes ago .
catch me feeling sorry for myself again and you got my permission to belt me in the nose !
buy you a drink?
lock and load , boy !
thanks !
two bourbon and ice .
a baby's a big event .
conway !
treating the boys?
crack open the hatch !
that's great .
a fellow always gets more kick out of a boy , i guess .
i got a kid .
sam , i named him ... ... after your old man .
wait till he gets to be ten and doesn't write .
you'll be mad enough to hit him .
no , i won't , stryker , because he won't have to write .
i'll be where he is .
and i won't insist that he be tough .
i'll try to make him intelligent .
and i won't insist that he read the marine corps manual .
i'll get him shakespeare .
i don't want him to be a colonel conway or sergeant stryker .
i want him to be intelligent , considerate , cultured and a gentleman .
you're out of line , kid .
let him be .
he has a right to dislike me .
thanks , and i intend to exercise that right .
i don't like you , stryker .
let's talk sense for a minute , conway .
i can't have friction in the squad .
i've tried every approach to you that i know .
got nowhere .
you're intelligent ...
don't patronise me .
your opinion of my iq doesn't interest me in the least .
let's get this straight .
on duty i jump when you holler .
off duty i exercise my god given rights under a democracy and dislike whom i please .
do we understand each other?
beat it .
come on , you guys , let's go .
i don't understand why you don't belt him .
mellow in my old age , i guess .
too bad .
screaming sam " couldn't be proud of him .
he could .
there's something inside a guy , always proud of a kid .
two more?
not for me .
i'll sail again .
one .
ok .
maybe you can steer me home?
charge !
pull pins !
prepare to throw !
throw !
all right , fifth relay !
what an arm !
pick it up !
right in the groove !
look , boy , this is a live grenade .
gee !
you know what they can do?
yes , sir .
right hand .
wait for the order to pull pin and pitch grenade .
got it?
yes , sir .
ready?
pull pin !
prepare to throw !
throw !
grenade !
hit the deck !
when will you wake up?
you wanna see her again , keep your mind on your work !
what happened here?
little accident , sir .
you're wounded .
corpsman !
yes , sir .
take care of the sergeant .
come right over here , sergeant .
you may not know it , but you just got your life saved .
you'll get a medal .
again the word came and the marines moved out .
again scuttlebutt knew a hundred destinations , all wrong .
this time we were a sound fighting unit , blooded and trained .
tarawa had blooded us .
stryker had trained us .
now , i'll show you something .
what you got there?
what does it look like?
a flag .
what are you gonna do with it?
occupy this island in the usa's name .
you think we'll have an easy time?
you got me with you .
maybe we need two of you .
one was enough in tarawa .
stick with me .
i'm a battle hardened veteran .
know how many japs i knocked off in tarawa?
32 .
did i get anything for it?
i got enemies in washington .
if the marines didn't have me , they'd never have made it .
now , this is how you fold a flag !
do you believe in intuition?
yeah ... in women .
why?
it's hard to explain .
i've a feeling i'm not coming out of this operation .
don't talk that way .
i can't help it .
it's the way i feel .
why?
i don't know .
it's like a voice in my ear .
i can't shake the feeling off .
take my advice , shake it off .
no dice .
when things like that get in you , it's no use trying to fight them .
if a marine waits long enough he gets the word .
our sealed orders came aboard after five days at sea .
this island is volcanic and sandy .
it's five and a half miles long and two and a half miles wide .
this mountain here is a dead volcano .
it's called suribachi .
there's nothing on the island except three airfields and about 20, 000 japs .
the army air corps b 24s have been bombing this place for 62 days .
maybe it'll be an easy operation then .
we can't be sure .
every yard is covered by some kind of fire .
there are two possible landing beaches , one on the east side , one on the west .
the rest of the coastline is cliffs .
they'll try and keep us off the beaches .
if they don't , they'll try and catch us at this first airfield , between the heights of suribachi and these high rocky ridges in the north .
they'll shell us from both sides .
nobody knows what they've got on this island .
but they've had 40 years to put it there .
saipan was our last stop .
the men who were going to hit the beach first transferred to ls ts .
a few more days at sea and the time for landing came .
saddle up !
skip along and into the amtracs .
anyway , it's a good day for it .
it's cold .
stick around , it'll get warm .
yeah , that's what i'm afraid of .
hey , look !
driver , you the joker that wrote that?
" semper fi " , mac !
we should take you in along with us .
hey , mchugh's going in with his pocket full of books !
five books he's got !
so?
the kid's a reader .
that shouldn't worry a dope like you .
when we're through with this operation , i'm gonna break both your legs !
i feel sick .
i know .
i felt the same way at tarawa .
hey , stein , " shalom aleychem " .
aleychem shalom .
sarge , i'm scared .
so am i.
not you !
fowler , i'm always scared .
line of departure !
get down !
lock and load !
drop those lifebelts when we hit the beach !
all right , hit the beach !
it ain't brooklyn !
if this place was a blanket i'd pull it over my head !
this is the poorest soil i ever saw .
what does anyone want an island like this for?
that's war .
what's war?
trading real estate for men .
when god made the world , he must have put all the rubbish left over here .
corpsman !
corpsman !
take it easy .
doggone it , almost the same place they got me before !
getting shot for this !
they're sure pouring it into suribachi .
not enough .
those nips are shooting right down our throats .
stryker !
yo !
lieutenant shrier wants to see you .
lieutenant shrier?
stand fast .
stryker reporting , sir .
i know .
your platoon's been hit hard .
what's left has been assigned to me .
yes , sir .
naval gunfire lifts at 1100 .
stand by .
aye , aye .
move out !
keep your distance !
go on , go on !
corpsman !
corpsman !
corpsman !
spread out !
dig in !
dunne , where's my brother?
back there .
he's hit .
flynn !
that's enough !
i told you you'd need this bad some day .
thanks , marine .
flynn !
get down !
you ain't got the sense of a rabbit !
you can still be a hero crawling !
corpsman !
ma'll dust me off if i don't get him back !
harris !
well , i'll get a good night's sleep tonight .
corpsman !
he won't need him .
pillbox too big to handle with these .
a bazooka?
if we had one .
i got nothing to do .
i'll go pick one up .
regazzi didn't make it .
you never know what's happening .
listen .
it's a tank .
yeah , but whose?
ours !
it's regazzi .
pillbox at 2 o'clock .
ok , give 'em a hot foot !
thanks , mac .
i couldn't find a bazooka .
you did all right .
saddle up !
no one had ever seen anything like it .
no one would have believed it possible .
that smoking , miserable , bloody island .
after three days and three nights , and at the end of that time , we'd barely reached the foot of suribachi , where we were the first day .
we'll sack here for the night .
best news today .
pair off and one man awake at all times .
keep alert .
let's go .
it'll start getting rough tomorrow against suribachi .
it started getting rough when you put on that uniform .
you wanna see a good looking kid?
husky little boot .
what's his name?
we're gonna name him sam , sam conway .
a name that's been awarded the navy cross is good enough for any kid .
there's something i've been trying to say but ...
i can't find the words .
two universities and you can't find the words to say you were out of line?
ok , i'm out of line .
no , you were .
there's a difference .
we'd better get some sack time .
wanna sleep first or watch?
i'll watch .
ok .
everybody gets out of line once in a while .
thanks , gyrene .
where's sergeant stryker?
stryker?
right there .
what do you want?
lieutenant shrier wants to see you .
stryker , sir .
yes , sir .
i'm taking a patrol up suribachi .
get your men squared away and be ready at 0700 .
the rendezvous is that nip tank there .
aye , aye , sir , 0700 .
that little voice whispering in your ear again?
don't worry .
i've known a million guys that have heard it .
most of them make it .
a few don't .
the percentage is on your side .
did you ever hear it?
no .
don't you ever worry about it?
what good would it do?
you're indestructible .
stick close .
it might rub off !
i'll do that .
banner three , this is easy five .
patrol is ready to move .
request supporting fire .
ow !
sh'ma yisrael , adonai elohenu ... adonai echad .
amen .
radio !
banner three , this is easy five .
over .
this is easy five .
cease fire , we're preparing to move over the top .
roger and out .
stryker !
yes , sir .
colonel's ordered that we put up this flag when the top's secure .
get it there .
aye , aye , sir .
what is this?
put yours away .
this is the one we're gonna use .
first squad .
find something we can use as a standard and we'll put this up .
conway , you made it .
i guess that little voice was wrong .
i feel better .
i feel better , too .
i never felt so good in my life .
how about a cigarette?
is he ...?
yeah .
if he had to get it it's the way he'd have wanted .
it's a letter to his kid .
dear son , i guess none of my letters have reached you .
i thought i'd try again as i'm feeling
that this may be the last time i can write you .
for a long time i've wanted to tell you many things .
now that you're a big boy , i will .
if we'd been together even for a while ,
i could've explained many things much better than writing them .
you've gotta take care of your mother , and love her and make her happy .
never hurt her or anyone as i did .
always do what your heart tells you is right .
maybe someone will write you some day and tell you about me .
i want you to be like me in some things , but not like me in others .
when you grow older and get to know more about me , you'll see i've failed ... " ... in many ways .
this isn't what i wanted but things just turned out that way .
if there was only more time i ...
guess he never finished it .
i'll finish it for him .
there she goes .
all right , saddle up !
let's get back in the war !
