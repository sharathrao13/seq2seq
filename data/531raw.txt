bored and stroked , full roller , 8 liters .
supercharged with a 25 psi boost , automated hydraulics ... ... high stall converter with shift kit .
that gonna do the trick?

i'm good .
i love this girl .
all right , the target is information .
it's on a hard drive inside my old headquarters , here .
the rest of it is at my house .
i'll pick that up tonight while you ...
information?
well , start by giving me some .
we on the same page?
you know what i'm talking about .
last time out , i went down , and you disappeared .
look , you aren't the only one who lost something that day .
when the fire started , you were busy with the general .
some of us went in to see who we could save .
now , you think this looks bad?
you should've seen it before i got it fixed .
guess nobody's story has a happy ending .
story's not over yet , soldier .
shavers ... ... can you make that into a personal weapon?

i'm really starting to miss the old xxx .
stop your vehicle now .
okay , i see you .
hey , get your ass out the driver's seat .
mission accomplished .
darius stone .
born south side , d. c.
mother died young , father raised him .
not much to report till '88 .
his dad was killed by a stray bullet in a 211 , and darius went off the grid .
started with graffiti , reckless driving .
quickly worked his way up to grand theft auto and resisting arrest .
took him some time to find his calling in the navy .
specifically , the navy seals .
trained sniper , top scores .
urban recon , demolition .
the highest dive in navy history , 250 feet .
augustus gibbons recruited him into an elite unit , level 5 classified .
ran ops in eastern europe till christmas in kosovo .
their general ordered them to set a fire to clear civilians ... ... but stone refused .
led a mutiny against a four star general ... ... the current secretary of defense , george deckert ... ... who had him court martialed for a 20 year term .
ten for disobeying direct orders ... ... and another 10 for breaking the general's jaw .
this is the last footage we have on him .
a meeting with his lawyer , jonathan edward cochran .
oh , that's cute .
johnnie cochran .
i don't think mr. stone can afford johnnie's fee .
do we have audio?
it's attorney client .
no mikes .
hold it there .
okay , reel it back .
back , back , back .
freeze it .
blow it up .
gibbons and stone on a comeback tour .
all right , listen up .
i want all eyes up and running on these two .
and i want hard 20s on the rest of their old unit .
i wanna know where they are ... ... i wanna know what they're doing , and i wanna know now .
i'm disappointed , auggie .
checkmate in three?
you should've seen it coming .
relax .
have a drink .
i took the liberty of pouring myself ...
you were always taking liberties .
same old gibbons .
good soldier with a bad attitude .
you know , i always remember the first day we met .
i remember the last day i saw you .
i bet you do .
didn't heal too well , did it?
some wounds never do .
i never asked you to go into that fire .
you just set it and watched it burn .
we did what needed to be done .
is that what you call it?
doing what you need to do "?
sixteen of my men killed?
what's that , just more friendly fire?
some men die so others may live .
funny ... ... that you never seem to be the one doing any of the dying .
i'll do whatever it takes to best protect this nation .
you're not protecting the nation .
you're doing this to protect yourself .
why?
what fires you starting now?
we both live in the same world .
we know what's out there .
save the speech .
just so you know ... ... whatever you're up to , you're not getting away with it .
why?
because darius stone is gonna stop me?
i'm sorry .
was that supposed to be a surprise?
gibbons , i know every move you make even before you do .
you still work for me , whether you know it or not .
i never worked for you .
i work for my country .
i don't know what's more pathetic ... ... a man that plays chess with himself ... ... or a man that doesn't see he's already lost .
make it look like an accident .
zero exposure .
sir , they found gibbons .
investigators say an apparent gas leak triggered the explosion .
the fire department was too late to save the occupant ... ... but managed to contain the fire before it spread .
the deceased , augustus gibbons , was a former navy captain .
he was 51 years old .
the funeral's tomorrow at arlington national cemetery .
gas leak .
right .
this is lisa joyner reporting from chevy chase , maryland for wjla .
back to you in the studio .
toby , let's get to work .
there's nothing on here .
nothing .
it's blank , man .
because you're looking in the wrong place .
gibbons said it was on the hard drive .
what are you doing?
i read about that .
cold war .
old school , right?
not that old school .
all right .
now , which one's charlie?
only one way to find out .
ready .
aim .
fire .
ready .
aim .
fire .
order arms .
like our lord and savior ... ... augustus eugene gibbons died in our service .
head of the nsa , fbl , joint chiefs , secretary of state .
damn .
you know what this means , right?
what?
they're gonna kill me next .
give me those .
damn , man .
if we're working together , you should work on your partner skills .
like , if you want something , try " please , " " may i borrow ...?
please , may i borrow the binoculars ... ... before i kick your teeth in?
okay .
see , now , that's a start .
not bad .
deckert?
you know secretary deckert?
oh , yeah .
we go way back .
but he hated everything about gibbons .
so , what is he doing here?
charlie .
you found him .
her .
her?
can you get me a suit?
oh , so now you wanna blend .
i hear this place has the best gumbo in town .
excuse me .
i'm actually meeting someone for lunch .
relax , charlie .
this'll only take a minute .
how did you know my name?
who are you?
we have a mutual friend .
augustus gibbons .
had a mutual friend .
and you didn't answer my question .
who are you?
my name is darius stone .
stone?
you have half the suits in this city looking for you .
why in the world would you come here?
trust me ... ... they won't look for a guy like me in a place like this .
well , no offense , but i don't trust anybody right now .
good .
that means we got something in common .
charlie .
i'm sorry i'm so late .
i had that urban youth meeting .
it ran over .
we're trying to set up that after school ... ... gun instructional program for kids and ...
i'm sorry .
dickie ambrose , nra .
hi .
reverend billy bob baker , southern baptist brotherhood .
well , it's just great to meet you , reverend .
hey , listen , we're setting up this rally upstate next week ... ... and i was just wondering if there was some way we could attract ... ... you know , some upstanding african americans like yourself .
you got any advice for us?
well , dick , perhaps you could tell your members ... ... to stop buying country music , stop burning crosses ... ... and stop shooting black folks .
hear me?
now , if that don't work ... ... try a cookout with free food .
preferably fried .
dick ... ... would you mind terribly if we rescheduled?
i think that would be ...
yeah , that's fine .
i have a lot of stuff to do .
reverend , i'll ...
call me .
i'll call you about that .
tell me about you and the captain .
i was gibbons 'contact on the hill .
i'm an aide to the senate subcommittee on military action .
military?
deckert .
secretary of defense deckert?
there's not a bullet shot in the dark that he don't know about .
so tell me something , charlie .
can you get me close to him?
well , reverend ... ... you think you can lay your hands on a tuxedo?
you made it .
you know , i never miss a party .
not quite the tux i had in mind .
yes , but i'm blending .
you see the guest of honor?
those bodyguards?
seal team four .
half my old unit .
and not the better half .
who's the ugly general he's talking to?
jack pettibone .
vice chair , joint chiefs .
doesn't look too happy .
must be the music .
one way to find out .
i truly can't believe what i'm hearing .
we go back 30 years , jack .
same blood in the same mud , and you never questioned my command .
i presume you've heard of the united states congress .
jack ... ... this country is being led down the wrong path .
you really think you can do this , don't you?
with just a few regiments .
once we lead , the full force will follow .
the clock is ticking .
with or without you .
three days .
he's here .
black guy , white tux .
had enough of the party?
hold on .
you asked me to track down the rest of their old troop?
well , half of them are still enlisted .
what about the other half?
gone .
missing .
the same men that backed stone against deckert .
every single one of them just disappeared .
wait a minute .
this is your home?
not bad for a senator's aide .
i'm not just a senator's aide .
i'm also a senator's daughter .
james mayweather , virginia .
think daddy's ready to meet a guy like me?
actually , daddy's out of town .
really?
make yourself at home , darius .
not a bad place to grow up , i guess .
only on the surface .
growing up in d. c. politics is like living in a snake pit .
everybody fighting for territory .
sounds a lot like where i grew up .
oh , no .
this is nothing like where i grew up .
let's get you out of those clothes , shall we?
here we go .
why don't you try these on .
not really my style .
why don't you go ahead and get cleaned up .
there's some fresh towels in the bathroom .
full service , huh?
you know , if you need anything ... ... i'm just right down the hall .
anything?
anything at all .
how about some fries and a shake?
the things i can't do for my country .
charlie?
charlie .
pettibone?
she set me up .
bitch .
this is the police .
come out with your hands behind your head .
we got the vice chair of the joint chiefs in there .
the assailant is armed and dangerous .
proceed with extreme caution , gentlemen .
gus , get me a hostage negotiator , clear a two block radius ... ... and five is the active perimeter .
better make that 10 .
captain , the man's a special forces sniper .
keep all fields clear at least half a mile downwind .
who the hell are you?
kyle steele , nsa .
captain , i need to speak to this man alive .
so?
it's a matter of national security , sir .
where the hell are you going?
going inside .
listen , i don't care who you are .
you got six minutes till we breach .
stone .
i'm coming in unarmed .
all right , close that door .
hands .
step forward .
how you know i wouldn't shoot you the second you stepped through?
i didn't .
you got five minutes till they knock that door down .
so let's skip the chitchat .
where's pettibone?
upstairs , dead .
you do it?
lf i did it ... ... you wouldn't know until i wanted you to .
now , turn around .
stone , this doesn't look too good , man .
an escaped convict breaks into a house with an automatic in hand ... ... and a dead man upstairs .
i didn't break in .
now , move .
you didn't break in here?
so , what , the general invited you over for a nightcap?
what happened?
you guys felt like playing russian roulette?
this is not my gun .
you expect me to buy that line?
it's not a line , it's the truth .
they set me up .
who set you up?
deckert .
deckert .
secretary of defense deckert .
he clipped gibbons when he got too close .
and now pettibone .
too close to what?
stone , we have three minutes .
level with me .
why are we here?
why'd you go after pettibone?
i didn't go after nobody .
i don't even know the guy .
never seen him before in my life .
easy .
that sure looks a lot like you .
damn , they're good .
think now is really the best time for a snack?
what they got out there , three teams?
flash bangs , body armor , heat scopes .
am i close?
stone , i wanna help you here , i really do .
but if you run , you look guilty .
brother , i was born looking guilty .
and now ... ... it's time for you to go .
where is he?
where is he?
captain , i got him .
looks like upstairs bathroom .
okay , go get him .
this is the last known photograph of the suspect .
cute picture .
yeah .
haircut suits you , definitely . near charlottesville , virginia .
the assailant is assumed to be armed and dangerous .
one of general pettibone's closest friends ... ... was defense secretary george deckert .
jack pettibone was a dear friend of mine .
and tonight , this nation has lost a great patriot .
and his quiet contributions will be properly recorded ... ... in history books yet to be written .
from base to base , camp pendleton to fort bragg ... ...
general pettibone's troops are en route ... ... to washington d. c.
for the funeral .
they're not coming for the funeral .
same blood , same mud .
pettibone and deckert both served for over 30 years together .
so that means pettibone's troops are also ...?
deckert's .
correct .
what's that got to do with the funeral?
the perfect cover .
deckert does the guest list ... ... only invites his boys to town .
he's got his army .
now , he's gotta be loading up .
how would he get his gear?
all orders go through his department , the dod .
right .
you want me to hack in?
to the u. s. department of defense?
we're talking 500 acres of hardware .
cray supercomputers , encryption chips ... ... not to mention more firewalls than the nsa , cla and the irs combined .
exactly .
hold my chips .
you know , you don't have to wait up .
you think i'd leave you alone with my car?
what's so special about this one?
shelby cobra prototype , 600 horses , 10, 000 rpm .
only three off the rack .
and we sold it for half a mil to some senator ... ... who'll never take her out of first gear .
half a mil for a car?
you been gone a while , d.
everything's more expensive now .
i could see that .
come here .
you've done real good , lo .
no rollbacks , part bins or stripped engines .
it's a long way from zeke's chop shop .
still got a few bins in the back .
and i still get my hands dirty .
classic's still a classic .
you remember the first time we dropped gears in this one?
i remember three squad cars at 100 plus on the parkway .
oh , she was fast .
yes , she was .
you remember all that damage we did in the back seat?
that was a long time ago , d.
not for me .
ready to do some more damage?
he shoots , he scores !
college boy just pulled off the hack of the century .
requisition order .
deckert's bringing all his troops and armored vehicles ... ... through a naval base up the potomac to the uss independence .
it's an aircraft carrier , man .
looks like we going upstate .
