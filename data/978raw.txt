what?
in life , there are all sorts of wake up calls .
but crowing on east 73rd street was one i was not prepared for .
it was my own fault .
i'd let my frenzy for a rent controlled apartment near barneys , override the fact that it was animal hospital adjacent .
that's the thing about new york you never know what's just around the corner .
or , in samantha's case , just outside your window .
there they were samantha's neighbourhood , transsexual hookers .
half man , half woman , totally annoying .
girl , she got herself a handful with that one !
he was all up in my stuff once .
i told him to get that thing out of my ass or i'll shit on it .
get that out my ass , or i'll shit on it .
is that the dirtiest thing you've ever heard?
let's hope so !
i am paying to live in a neighbourhood that's trendy by day , and tranny by night .
transsexuals .
chicks with dicks .
boobs on top , balls down below .
i don't get the appeal there .
it's the other white meat .
i understand that pseudo straight men have to get laid , but not on my block .
i thought my chickens were bad .
every morning at 4 : 00 am they start up .
it's like they're putting on a show .
the " up my ass players " .
too early for tranny talk?
it's so weird to be sitting here eating omelette again
like nothing ever happened .
it was our first saturday morning breakfast since charlotte had left trey , her husband of three months .
i was married .
and now , what?
i'm single again?
you're not single , you're just separated .
that's right .
i'll never be single again ...
i'll be divorced .
the only thing worse than being 34 and single is being 34 and divorced .
nice .
i think it's worse to be 34 and trapped in a marriage that doesn't work .
didn't i try hard enough?
" hard " is the word .
sweetie , trey has an impotence problem ...
i am so sick of talking about trey .
i think and talk about trey all the time .
change the subject , please .
talk about the " up my ass " stuff .
ok , here's the plan .
sunday night , we all come over , have an unpacking party and no trey talk .
i'll bring the cocktails .
i'll bring the food .
how about roof chicken?
can i help you?
i live around the corner and my window
looks over the roof with the chickens and the crowing ...
roosters .
excuse me?
they are roosters .
roosters crow .
yes , they do .
and very loudly .
i'm so sorry .
we just got them .
rescued from a cockfight in the bronx .
my god .
i'll have them moved to the basement .
you don't have to do that .
they had all that fight trauma .
they need fresh air .
i don't want them to be miserable .
don't worry .
they have a very lovely life .
that's all right .
i'll get over it .
thank you for being so nice .
just gonna take one of these for my friend .
she has a cat .
are you hungry?
yeah?
i'm hungry too .
shanghai garden .
may i help you?
i'd like to order some take out .
address , please .
331 west 78th street .
apartment 4f .
i'd like to order some chicken with broccoli in a brown ...
brown sauce , with brown rice .
cold noodles .
i know .
every night the same .
right .
the chinese take out lady thinks i'm pathetic .
every night , the same thing .
that's a tad bitchy for a take out lady .
do you think i'm in a rut?
a food rut?
i'm sitting home with my cat , ordering the same thing almost every night .
the only thing sadder would be to have a cathy comic on my refrigerator door .
never say cathy comic to me again .
she giggled at me .
the take out lady .
order from someplace else .
there is like 600 chinese places on your block .
this place is my favourite .
it's easier than figuring out where else to go .
then bear the take out food shame .
there they were .
our ex boyfriends .
what are they doing together?
are they friends now?
apparently .
this is bad .
what do you think they are talking about?
their dogs?
how's your dog?
good , yours?
was that the bitches who ruined our lives?
they didn't see us .
we have a choice .
we can either run the other way or move into this building .
we can't run .
your shoe straps will break .
how do i look?
good .
great !
you look great too .
thank god i didn't wear my drawstring pants .
look who it is !
that's another thing about new york .
you never know who is around the corner .
this is what i like about new york .
street traffic .
well , look at you .
look who it is , pete .
my god !
look how big he got .
he starts college next year .
you must be very proud .
two beers at a time .
did miranda and i give you guys a drinking problem?
they are not just for us .
i'll have nightmares about that ladies room for weeks .
carrie and miranda , this is jessica and susan .
hello .
honey , do you still wanna see the movie or just crash?
i don't care .
we have to go .
yeah , we gotta go .
it was good to see you , aidan .
come on , this way .
that night at charlotte's , some light unpacking and some heavy realisations .
well , they are over us .
it's just so hilarious .
i'm haemorrhaging inside .
we thought they were sitting there , pining , and they have new girlfriends already !
were they cute?
the point is not if they were cute .
the point is , they were there .
they were cute .
very cute .
how can they have new relationships?
i'm still in the " i just broke up with someone " phase .
it's infuriating .
women sit around obsessing about what went wrong .
men just say " all righty " and move on .
i take offence at that generalisation .
not all women sit around and obsess about men .
as soon as my relationships are over , i move on .
relationships?
you know , dates .
i do try to figure out what went wrong .
but i don't think that i obsess .
you are miss obsess .
big?
big was tricky .
i still don't know what happened there .
you should have a relationship rear view mirror .
relationships may appear closer than they actually are .
i didn't obsess about aidan .
aidan was clear .
he moved on .
it's much easier for men to move on .
is it?
oh , please !
the ratio of women to men in this city is huge .
they can sit outside , have a beer and wait for the jessicas and susans to come to them .
maybe we only obsess over relationships that feel unfinished .
i can guarantee that trey isn't sitting around with his friends , obsessing about what went wrong .
men never think anything is their fault .
i wish there were no men .
call someone , she's gone insane .
if there were no men , then we wouldn't feel hurt .
and we wouldn't be disappointed .
and we wouldn't be spending our entire night obsessing about them .
i'm so over men .
what?
i am .
later that night i got to thinking about men and women and relationships .
or more to the point , how women feel men disappoint them in relationships .
then a radical , almost earth shattering thought popped into my head .
what if everything isn't the man's fault?
after a certain age and a certain number of relationships , if it still isn't working and the ex's seem to be moving on and we don't , perhaps the problem isn't the last boyfriend , or the one before him or even the one before him .
could it be , that the problem isn't them , but horror of horrors , is it us?
downtown , the " up my ass players " were in the middle of their late night repertory .
much ado about up my ass " and " long day's journey up my ass " .
samantha decided if she was gonna get a good night's sleep , she'd have to test how effective a pr professional she was .
ladies , hello .
i live right up there , the loft within earshot .
as much as i respect a woman's right for a little something with certain new jersey gentlemen ,
i have a request .
i have a very early business meeting .
and i think we all know , there are certain dark circles even the best make up tricks can't cover .
am i right?
sorry to wake you , baby .
we'll take it down here .
i appreciate it .
by the way , i'm samantha .
destiny .
chyna .
jo .
no " e " .
she got the " e " cut off .
those heels are fierce , miss girl .
don't i know it .
samantha always knew how to get her way with men , even if they were half women .
what?
rough night?
who is this?
it's me .
i didn't recognise your voice .
you sounded different .
did i wake you?
it's only 11 : 30 .
no , i was up late working .
and there were these goddamn chickens that crow on the roof next door .
roosters .
roosters crow .
the " fun on the farm " fact everyone seems to be aware of but me .
so tell me , is red a mistake?
in what way?
i'm repainting my bedroom .
a red bedroom?
just one wall .
but i think it's too red .
it's like sleeping in communist china .
she left ...
we ended it .
i heard .
you did?
how?
i think it was on the news .
could we have lunch sometime?
i really need to talk to you .
please?
where?
the boathouse restaurant , central park .
how about saturday at 2 : 00?
carrie?
i'm nodding .
so i'll see you at 2 : 00 then .
bye .
later that day , i met miranda at my favourite thrift store , to dig for buried treasure .
do you think i can get away with a " hang in there , baby " halter top?
nobody gets away with a " hang in there , baby " halter top .
do you wanna go to the hopper exhibit saturday afternoon?
i can't .
i have to work .
i lied .
i don't have to work .
i'm meeting big for lunch and i didn't think you'd approve .
you're meeting big?
he called .
he sounded upset and needed to talk .
since when does big talk?
what does that mean?
he's upset about natasha leaving ...
i'm not holding your hand through this again .
i'm not asking you to hold my anything .
we're just having lunch .
it's a huge mistake .
it's not a huge mistake , it's lunch .
how many more times are you gonna go through this?
he is bad for you .
every time you get near him you turn into this pathetic , needy victim .
what pisses me off is that you are more than willing to go back for more .
i am not going back for more and i can't even believe ...
i can't believe you would say that to me .
if you start up with big again ...
i am not starting up with big again .
if you do , i don't wanna know anything about it .
no calls .
no crying .
are you gonna cut me out of your life like you did to steve?
what?
first sign of any little weakness or flaw and you just write people off .
my god , miranda .
you are so judgmental .
you can say that i'm pathetic and needy and i can't say anything to you?
everybody is not as tough as you , miranda .
people ...
some of us make mistakes .
that's just perfect .
walk away .
it's all my fault .
right there , next to the 2 for $5 bin ,
miranda and i had our first big fight .
you have no messages .
i thought by the time i got home , she would have left an apology on my machine .
i was gonna call her , but wasn't quite sure of what to say .
or whose fault it really was .
and at the exact same moment across town ,
miranda was preparing to make the call she'd been dreading all day .
shanghai garden .
may i help you?
i'd like to order some take out .
address , please .
331 west 78th street , apartment 4f .
i'd like some ...
chicken with broccoli , brown sauce , brown rice and cold noodles , right?
you know what?
i don't need this .
never mind .
ok .
bye bye .
after she hung up , miranda couldn't get the giggle out of her head .
she decided to walk the two blocks to confront the woman with the judgmental giggle who thought she was better than her .
shanghai garden .
may i help you?
ok .
address , please .
224 west 78th ...
sorry , 73 .
miranda realised the giggle wasn't about her at all .
it wasn't about anything .
it wasn't the noodles that kept her coming back to this particular restaurant .
it was the fact that this had been their place and it was filled with happy memories .
twice in one week .
am i lucky or what?
i thought i got custody of this place .
i like their hot and sour soup .
are you here by yourself?
me too .
sit down .
i've got this bowl of crunchies that i'll never get through .
how are you?
not good .
carrie and i had a huge fight .
about what?
me , her , you , big ...
me .
my judgmental stuff .
how bad was it?
it wasn't good .
steve , i didn't throw you away .
did i?
no .
she said i did .
miranda ...
only you and i can ever really know what happened between you and i.
it's nobody else's business .
but she said that , huh?
must've been pretty mad .
i didn't say nice things to her either .
i just don't want her to get hurt again .
so you yelled at her?
yeah .
sounds about par .
i guess your new girlfriend doesn't yell .
no .
how's that going?
it's ok .
like to order?
yes , i'd like the chicken with broccoli ...
let me see the menu .
i should try something new .
you should .
go ahead .
live a little .
there is so much .
you're so fucking hot .
i can't believe they go away for one night and then back three in a row .
forget them .
look at me .
i'm sorry .
i'm here .
where are those cops?
i called them half an hour ago .
look at me .
let's bring it on home .
i can't .
i'm close .
well , i'm not .
the idea that she'd miss a night's sleep , pissed samantha off .
the idea that she'd miss an orgasm , was more than she could bear .
shut up , you bitches !
i've called the cops .
suck my cock !
keep talking and i'll come down there and cut it off for you .
i'd like to see you try , motherfucker .
you think we want that bs?
no way !
are you gonna pull a lorena bobbit? $7, 000 a month and i have to put up with this , talking to fucking trannies?
i don't fucking think so !
i am a taxpayer and a member of the young women's business association .
i don't have to put up with this shit !
forget them and come back to bed .
there was nothing anyone could do to stop her .
samantha was obsessed .
she had a date with destiny , chyna and jo , no " e " .
take this , ladies !
i'm gonna come up there and kick your ass , bitch !
get off my hair now !
move it along , girls .
you heard the man , move it along .
hey , where are you going?
home .
you freak me out .
and uptown , charlotte was a bit freaked out as well .
unable to sleep and unable to unpack , she was spending time with the only man she could tolerate the dalai lama .
charlotte?
it's me .
trey?
what are you doing here?
it's 4 : 00 am .
i saw your light on from the street .
i figured you'd still be up .
what do you want?
ever since you left , i can't stop thinking about you .
honey , we're separated .
i know .
it seems , once charlotte swore off men , this man couldn't get enough of her .
he wasn't a rooster and it wasn't the bronx , but from somewhere deep inside ,
trey's cock began to crow .
across town , i was still wide awake .
i couldn't get my fight with miranda out of my head .
turns out , i was not only capable of obsessing about relationships with men ,
i was capable of obsessing about relationships with women .
east side animal shelter .
please leave a message .
this is your neighbour who complained about the chickens .
i'm leaving a message 'cause i can't take it any more .
move them in .
thanks .
i figured if they had a lovely life , i was entitled to the same thing .
well ...
all righty .
i knew that was in me somewhere .
you did?
i just hadn't felt it since before ...
why did you stop yourself?
before what?
since before we got engaged .
oh .
yeah .
oh .
do you think our whole problem had to do with the fact that ...
what?
say it .
you didn't really wanna marry me .
no .
i think it may be due to the fact that i didn't want to get married to anybody .
then why did you?
i guess i thought it was time .
i'm of a certain age , people expect you to get married .
yes , well ...
that sounds familiar .
one other thing ...
what?
i married you because i knew i'd never find anyone as wonderful as you to marry .
he may have gone away , the transsexual , but he came back , loaded with eggs .
now who's laughing , bitch?
samantha knew this was one relationship with a man she couldn't walk away from .
because this man was half woman .
good , you're there .
i was just gonna call you .
do you really think i'm pathetic?
no , i'm so sorry .
i don't think you're pathetic at all .
i'm outside the restaurant , hiding in some bushes .
do you still not think i'm pathetic?
i know you think it's a huge mistake .
it's just something i feel i need to do to move on .
don't listen to me .
i have no idea what's right for you and big .
but if i'm wrong and it is a huge mistake , i need to know you'll be there for me .
i'm there .
i'm going in .
any last minute advice?
don't let him kiss you .
that seems to be where you get into trouble .
carrie?
i'm nodding .
hello , you .
hello , you .
it's good to see you .
are you ok?
my hair is in a duck pond .
my dior purse .
i'll get it .
oh , my god !
what is that?
how was your shower?
i no longer smell of pond .
exactly how many terry cloth robes do you have?
three or four .
oh , three or four .
i swore i would never be in this room with you again .
you said to take you to the nearest shower .
that is one red wall .
yes , it's red .
i gotta ask you a question .
was it all my fault?
no .
it wasn't all your fault .
we really screwed that up .
what were we thinking?
i have no idea .
fuck .
i was counting on you for answers .
how are you doing , kid?
pretty good .
how are you doing?
good .
beside for the fact i feel like i've been through a war .
we really were war buddies .
war buddies in calvin klein robes .
i hate to admit this , but i kind of like living alone again .
why doesn't that surprise me?
i should go .
don't you want to stay a while?
i can't .
why?
because , sweet friend , you and i are like that red wall .
it's a good idea in theory .
but somehow , it doesn't quite work .
and just like that , i realised big and i weren't " us " any more .
we had become something else .
what it was , i had no idea .
you have one new message .
it's me .
i'm just wondering how it went .
call me when you get home .
i had no idea where the chickens had gone , but i hoped it wasn't the bronx .
and i hoped they were happy .
who wants a wiener?
girl , i'm trying to get rid of one .
the next saturday , samantha decided to throw a kiss and make up party for the " up my ass players " .
trey called me three times last week .
he's dying to get back together .
but i don't know .
is that wise?
i'm obsessing again , aren't i?
a bit .
so , what are we all drinking?
flirtinis . " vodka , pineapple and champagne .
flirtinis .
destiny made them .
i'm way past a flirtini .
i need a " fucktini " .
watch your language .
there are ladies present .
where?
you with the flower .
are you talking to me?
it's you , girl .
come on .
what do you want?
i want you to give me a swirl .
i need to see you spin first , sister .
is that good enough?
give me the shake .
don't mind the weight .
eat something .
don't worry , they have a very lovely life .
