brother ignacio?
what are you doing?
five rings , padre .
to summon zorro in case there's trouble .
if i know zorro , he's already here .
aren't you supposed to be in school?
padre , what if zorro comes?
i'll make sure he carves a z on your backside .
how's that sound?
really?
a landslide in favor of statehood .
let's hope the rest of california voted the same , huh?
take this to the governor .
hermano , be careful .
our future's in your hands .
i pray that the other provinces have been as peaceful as ours .
the latest model in heavy artillery , the henry repeater .
if god didn't hurl lightning , he'd surely carry one of these .
state your business , mcgivens .
i haven't voted yet .
i'm sorry , you're too late .
the polls have already closed .
now , that doesn't seem equitable .
i have rights too .
now , if you'd be kind enough , hand me that box , i'll be on my way .
you'd only force the people to vote again .
well , you remember that babylon was condemned to ashes ... ... for extending its empire to inferior races !
i come to deliver the lord's work against this vote .
time to do the lord's work .
zorro !
zorro !
zorro !
move it .
move it .
get out of the way !
get out of the way !
get him !
over the hill to the governor's mansion .
i said , over the hill to the governor's mansion !
we really have to work on your english .
zorro !
zorro !
zorro !
what happened?
where are my men?
they were held up , governor .
i offered my help .
citizens of san mateo !
today we have voted to join the union as a free state !
but this is only the beginning .
in three months ... ... every vote of every pueblo around california will be counted !
and it is my hope that we will finally call ourselves ... ... americans !
good boy .
your saddle is getting a little too tight , amigo .
tell me we won .
tell me we are free .
we're free .
to statehood .
to us .
i wish i was there today .
you were .
i cannot believe it .
we have our lives back .
now we can take joaquin to a trip to spain .
i cannot imagine how it has changed .
elena ...
and new york .
you should see new york , alejandro .
it's as if the whole world has moved onto one tiny island .
elena , i've been thinking and ...
never a good sign .
listen , california won't really be a state for another three months .
yes?
the federal marshals may need help keeping things under control until then .
look , i know what you're thinking ...
elena .
elena , listen , listen .
no , here is me , here is quitting .
we're this far apart .
elena .
i cannot believe it .
i cannot believe i fell for it .
husband promises to quit , gullible wife believes him .
how could i be so stupid?
oh , elena , you're overreacting .
i'm overreacting?
you made a promise .
we made a promise .
i know .
you are missing your son's entire life .
no , no , no .
no , no , no .
i am not missing anything .
oh , really?
really .
what is his teacher's name?
that's an easy one .
mister ...
brother ...
father kin ...
jin ...
hoofer?
so i have a bad memory .
what does that prove?
that you do not know your own son .
and even worse , he does not know you .
what would you rather have me do?
live my life as a wealthy don?
order servants around all day?
is that what you think i do , huh?
order servants around all day?
no , no , don't twist my words .
people still need zorro .
no , no , no .
you need zorro .
look me in the eyes and tell me that is not true .
you remember what you said the day joaquin was born?
my family is my life .
do you know how lucky you are to have made it this far?
alive?
that your enemies have not discovered who we are?
for 10 years , you have fought to give california its freedom .
why can't you give us ours?
they are calling you .
it's who i am , elena .
it's who i am .
what happened to the man i married?
what happened to the woman who used to fight by my side?
she had a son .
so he'll grow up to be a nice little aristocrat ... ... who has no idea where he came from ... ... and doesn't care about anyone but himself .
beautiful .
if you walk out that door , you are not sleeping here tonight .
maybe i'll just take my suitcase .
i hope you and tornado are very happy together .
we will be .
i love you .
i spy with my little eye ... ... something beginning with h.
why wasn't papi at breakfast?
i told you .
he left early on business .
he always goes on business .
yes , he does .
what exactly does he do?
well , he is a don .
and he meets with other dons ... ... and they discuss land and investments ... ... and it's all very important work .
so he sits around with friends counting money .
oh , joaquin .
you should not be so hard on your father .
you are more like him than you think .
we can talk more about this later , all right?
i love you .
who are you?
the real question , seora de la vega , is who are you?
the devoted wife of a wealthy don?
or an independent woman held captive by her husband's secrets?
what do you want?
your help .
one?
i tell you , de la vega , women say they want one thing ... ... but what they really want is everything else .
think of this as a vacation from the shackles of matrimony .
isn't it possible our wives marry us ... ... because they want to spend some time with their husbands?
so let me understand this .
if i take your advice ... ... i can look forward to spending my days pruning in a tub of naked men?
thanks for the advice .
but no .
where are you going?
to beg elena's forgiveness .
goodness me .
might one of you be don alejandro de la vega?
yes .
phineas gendler , attorney at law .
i'm here on behalf of your wife .
if you should have any questions , my address is on the letterhead .
good day , sir .
gentlemen .
i'm sorry , seor .
but you told me to make sure you didn't sleep past 2 today .
what's today?
wednesday .
of course .
i have to pick up joaquin .
what happened to my clothes?
i removed them last night so you wouldn't catch pneumonia .
you removed them?
after you came back from the cantina , you went for a swim .
in my clothes?
this hotel doesn't have a pool .
we have a fountain .
i see .
well , thank you , lupe .
perhaps you just can turn around , eh?
i'll see you at confession , my child .
don't look at me like that .
i know what you're gonna say .
no .
no , i came here to lift your spirits , not to dampen them .
who said my spirit needed lifting?
alejandro , you are being a pig headed fool .
why don't you just tell elena you were wrong .
she's the one who wanted me to live a lie .
to stop being myself .
as if california could live without me .
wake up .
i haven't had to ring that bell in three months .
you should be rejoicing .
i am rejoicing !
all right .
you cannot rot in this room forever .
a vineyard is opening tonight .
you're coming to the party with me .
my whole life is a party .
thank you , no .
be at the lobby at 8 .
and don't bother coming to confession , because i'll never forgive you .
you'd blackmail my soul , eh?
hell , yes .
now ... ... would anyone else like to interrupt my lecture ... ... by asking to go to the bathroom?
no .
who can tell me what this word means?
joaquin?
joaquin de la vega !
perhaps you can tell the class what statehood means to you .
no more exploitation of the peasants by the rich ... ... who oppress us with a flaming poker of injustice .
and how exactly does a flaming poker fit into your little theory?
it fits ... ... in your butt .
now i will give you something to laugh about .
come here .
no?
joaquin !
joaquin !
joaquin !
get back inside !
joaquin .
so , what's with you , huh?
you're lucky father quintero didn't throw you out for good .
stop making excuses .
why do you keep picking fights?
you don't understand .
sometimes you have to fight .
oh , really?
says who?
says him .
listen , if zorro were here , he'd tell you fighting isn't always the answer .
how do you know what he'd say?
trust me , i know him a lot better than you think .
no , you don't .
you never been in a fight in your life .
you didn't even fight to keep mom .
i am your father , little man .
don't talk to me like that .
there's nothing on earth i wouldn't do for you or your mother .
understand?
don alejandro .
don alejandro .
guillermo .
blanca .
hello .
look at little jos .
poor thing .
he's as ugly as his mother .
look at joaquin .
you're growing up so fast .
if business keeps up , we'll be able to pay you back sooner than we thought .
i told you , it was a gift .
to celebrate your son's birth .
hey , seor .
that knife is only 2 dollars .
well , i'll give you 500 for it .
and for that , i'll take the deed to your rancho , with the lord's gratitude .
we've already told you , we'll never sell .
family man like you might wanna keep his woman on a shorter leash .
they said they are not selling , sir .
have we met before , sir?
i would remember a man with wooden teeth .
and i'd remember a mex breed dressed like a white man .
you think your pappy's gonna crow , little man?
or is he gonna cluck?
leave him out of ...
seor , as a gentleman , i am obliged to teach my son to turn the o ...
you mean that cheek?
is everything all right , boys?
respects to you , officer .
respects , respects .
think about my offer , or i'll be obliged to do the lord's work .
ten minutes , then i'm going .
effervescent , yet tenacious .
i thought you were forbidden to drink .
what the ...?
i need at least one vice to keep in touch with sinners .
whatever .
who owns this vineyard anyway?
a count recently in from france .
i'm told he purchased it from don gallo's widow .
french count , you say?
he's probably still in his parlor putting on makeup .
or his perfume , perhaps .
rumor has it they invented it to avoid bathing .
and you are ...?
de la vega .
alejandro de la vega .
you're de la vega .
what an honor .
i've heard so much about you .
really?
from whom?
you know , i'd love to continue this conversation ... ... but i'm wanted elsewhere .
please excuse me .
i just met the most charming fellow .
and who might that be?
ladies and gentlemen !
welcome .
i still don't know why they call it a winetasting .
after two glasses you can't taste anything .
friends , californians .
this vineyard represents what i hope will become an industry ... ... that depends on the people for its success .
involving them instead of exploiting them .
that's what america means to me .
the promise of a country by the people , for the people !
a country blessed with limitless beauty .
but none more stunning than my escort for the evening .
ladies and gentlemen ... ... seora elena de la vega !
well , i'm pooped .
come on , let's go .
go?
i don't wanna go .
i'm having so much fun .
monsieur and madame lupon .
pleasure , madame .
thank you .
very nice to meet you .
alejandro .
elena .
armand .
de la vega .
count .
you know each other?
we shared a giggle at the buffet table .
it seems that's not all we have shared .
allow me to defuse an awkward situation .
elena has portrayed you as a man of impeccable character .
i am honored to be mentioned at all .
why , i nearly forgot we were still married only three months ago .
a blessing on your vineyard , count .
thank you for inviting us , but we have a mass ...
don't be rude , felipe .
i'm just dying to know how the lovebirds met .
another time .
we have many guests to greet .
armand , good evening .
governor riley .
you honor us with your presence .
may i present my wife , mary .
your speech was incredibly moving , count .
i'm glad you're not running for office against my husband .
i wouldn't challenge the man who's going to lead california into the union .
i fear there may not be much of a union left to join , governor .
everyone , may i introduce ... ... colonel r. s. beauregard , of the 1 st alabama infantry .
what brings you here , colonel?
the threat of civil war , my dear .
once california joins the union , the confederate states'll be outnumbered .
my countrymen find that troubling .
all this talk of politics , you know how it bores me , armand .
shall we dance?
of course .
excuse us , gentlemen .
ladies and gentlemen , the imperial quadrille .
perhaps you shouldn't drink on an empty stomach .
perhaps you should wear lipstick if you're gonna act like my mother .
say the word and i'll escort you home .
and leave your guests?
in a heartbeat .
i care for you too much to subject you to an evening of forced smiles , elena .
you .
you are the one not acting like yourself .
since when do politics bore you?
since when did you start caring what i think?
you .
if you wish , i'll have him escorted out .
i can handle him .
for the love of god , let's get out of this place .
i can handle her !
you must tell me how you met .
years ago , in spain .
we were at finishing school together .
oh , how nice .
you were reunited so he could finish .
don't force me to embarrass you .
sorry , too late !
so tell me , count , what does your title rank among noblemen?
it is higher than , say , a duke?
oh , it's rather common , actually .
much like a don .
oh , he's a delight .
rich , good looking and royalty .
is there anything i can say to make you leave?
you can fall to your knees and beg me to take you back .
i would not want to ruin my dress .
good .
i'm enjoying single life .
is that supposed to make me jealous?
does it?
never !
who's looking after joaquin while his mother spends her nights out?
i have not spent my nights out .
i haven't even told joaquin !
now , i think you should go !
you know ...
let me go !
i finally understand why you left me .
it was beneath you to marry a peasant like me .
you're drunk .
your stepfather would be so proud ... ... to see you take your rightful place on the arms of royalty !
keep your voice down !
congratulations , your highness !
if you didn't know me better than that , then you never knew me at all .
no .
thank you ... ... for your hospitality , count .
could you ...?
could you ...?
could you ...?
could you give me that back?
hey , hey !
cut it out !
you had enough .
stinky ...
aren't you forgetting something , estpido? !
count armand ... ... with his fancy wine and the froufrou accent .
how could elena choose a man like that?
i'll make her want me back so badly , she will be weeping with desire .
nobody leaves my tequila worm dangling in the wind !
oh , my god .
thank you .
god bless you , seor .
how kind of you .
i was trying to impress you .
if you truly want to impress me , invite me over for dinner tonight .
cook me something sinful .
why not dine at your hacienda?
i'd really like to meet your son .
please try and understand , armand .
he's not ready for another man in my life just yet .
of course .
i understand .
what is it?
oh , this hat .
it's breathtaking .
shall i purchase it for you?
on second thought , who needs another hat?
what i need is ... ... a pipe !
a pipe?
a pipe .
like my father used to smoke .
i hope i do not repulse you with my unladylike habit .
no , no .
on the contrary , you fascinate me .
oh , there's a vendor .
wait here , won't you?
what are you doing here?
when did you start smoking a pipe?
i don't smoke .
i said that to get rid of him so i can get rid of you .
i have to talk to you about last night .
i forgive you .
goodbye .
no , no , no , not that .
after .
i saw something in the forest .
what are you talking about?
yes , what are you talking about?
an explosion .
close to your chateau , in fact .
like nothing i have ever seen .
i simply wanted to make sure you were both safe .
as much as you had to drink last night , i'm sure your vision was impaired .
yet somehow it's all becoming clear .
if you have any respect for the relationship you shared with elena ... ... let it die with dignity .
i have to know i am losing her to a better man .
i can assure you of that .
all right , that is enough .
alejandro , time to go .
elena , please .
alejandro has come for peace of mind .
i am obliged to give it to him .
perhaps we can settle this like gentlemen .
you do play polo , i take it?
doesn't everyone?
i suggest we play as they do in slovenia .
a fine city .
country .
naturally .
may i offer you something to drink?
double tequila , no salt .
perhaps a game of croquet would be less hazardous to your health .
did you drop something?
or you just resting?
you know , i think i like this game .
promise me when you lose you will leave us alone .
what makes you think i will lose?
woman's intuition .
to the victor go the spoils .
now keep your promise and go .
you cheated , so i take it back .
goodbye , alejandro .
what do you really know about this man?
we were never meant to be together .
you don't love him .
after 10 years of marriage , you cannot hide the truth from me .
de la cruz is the bartender who works at the saloon across the street .
he says he overheard mcgivens gathering his men to go see cortez .
your father asked me to pick ...
cortez !
the deed , if you please .
bring it here .
no , guillermo , don't !
please , seor .
this land is all we have .
and the lord shall expel them before you ... ... and ye shall possess their land !
salvation ... ... damnation .
got one thing in common .
you gotta die to find either one .
how true .
drop your guns .
all of you !
guillermo , blanca , get in the house .
you are one blind mexican .
you don't know what you're getting yourself into .
neither do you .
shoot him !
let him be !
come on !
let's move !
don't let them hurt you .
i won't .
i promise .
go on !
break it down !
blanca .
blanca .
no !
guillermo !
guillermo !
guillermo .
guillermo .
guillermo , please talk to me .
talk to me !
please !
what are you trying to tell me , huh?
no matter what choice i make , it's always the wrong one !
i have failed everyone i ever loved .
my wife , my son and now the people too !
what do you want from me? !
help me .
i have always listened to my heart .
and it speaks to me now of a great darkness .
i fear guillermo cortez was only the beginning ... ... and that elena is in great danger too .
so i beg you ... ... give me the courage , the strength ... ... to wear the mask a little longer .
allow zorro one last ride .
come here .
she's going to the vineyard .
we can post men near the gate in case we have to pull her out .
if she's compromised , she's of no further use .
consider her an acceptable loss .
master , a word?
please , excuse me a moment .
the shipment arrives at maderas cove .
the carving is beautiful .
and what is through that door?
private chapel .
piety is a long standing tradition in my family .
i'd show it to you , but dinner's waiting .
that was absolutely delicious .
and now ...
oh , no , i'm sorry , marie , i do not smoke .
unless it is my pipe , of course .
oh , you remembered .
how thoughtful .
but i think i should let my stomach settle first .
elena .
i want to ask you something .
something i should've asked you many years ago .
before you do , my love , answer me one question .
whatever your heart desires .
where is the bathroom?
i would like to powder my cheeks .
of course .
down the hall .
excuse me .
excuse me , sir .
a gentleman is here to see you .
he says it's important .
he's building a track to the vineyard .
i presume you have the deed ... ... since you deemed it necessary to interrupt my dinner .
right here .
but it seems we have a fly in the ointment .
or should i say a fox .
zorro .
i've heard the name among the locals .
he's a peasant masquerading as a folk hero .
men like that usually find their way to the guillotine .
i've been informed one of my shipping vessels is arriving tomorrow .
they'll anchor off maderas cove .
the cargo must be brought here safely .
i want no mistakes .
now that we have the deed , will the track be completed on time?
it'll take my boys two days to cover the quarter mile .
i'll hold you to that , mr. mcgivens .
otherwise you get nothing .
listen to me , you backwards ass frog ... ... you hedge on my money , you won't ever see me co ...
this dagger , mr. mcgivens ... ... jake ... ... has been in my family for generations .
if you ever talk to me like that again ... ... i will cut out your tongue and i'll feed it to my dogs .
understood?
your men have two days , mr. mcgivens ... ... then the future begins .
i trust you can find your own way out .
orbis unum .
alejandro !
for god's sake , why can't you leave me alone?
elena , i was right .
armand is not who you think he is .
you have no idea who i think he is .
i think i know .
no , because you do not think .
get out before somebody sees you .
elena , listen to me .
guillermo cortez is dead .
what?
armand needed his land to build a railroad .
he's planning something .
how do you know this?
oh , no .
i won't tell you what i know until you tell me what you know .
if you wanna know , i need to know why you are living in sin with an evil count !
elena?
elena?
there you are .
forgive me , armand .
i just had the sudden urge to step out for a puff .
are you all right?
fine .
my god , you're turning green .
it's just your presence takes my breath away .
good , because i have a little something for you .
a customary spanish offering ... ... for when a man asks a woman for her hand in marriage .
let me do this on one knee so i can look up into your eyes .
oh , no , don't look up .
is that a yes?
it's a definite maybe .
i know it's sudden , given what you've just been through ... ... but i want to give you everything your former husband couldn't .
you don't have to answer now ... ... but whatever you decide , the necklace is yours .
thank you .
but i have to go .
i must put joaquin to bed .
of course .
your children require attention .
pearls .
welcome , children , to bear point .
it was on this desolate spot ... ... that our state flag was raised for the first time .
tomorrow our governor will be hosting a celebration here ... ... to honor california's statehood .
joaquin de la vega !
are you paying attention?
take out your notebooks ...
hold up .
scorcher of a day , ain't it , kids?
is there something i can help you with , seor?
don't let me interrupt the lesson , father .
i'm just on my way to do the lord's work .
mount up , boys .
come on .
grab that there , will you?
let's get to work , boys .
all right !
what are you doing here kid?
looking at two of the ugliest guys i've ever seen .
come on .
do you want a piece of me?
carajo !!
zorro nos salvaste
stay there !
orbis unum .
i can't believe it's you .
you're really zorro .
and that's tornado , right?
i mean , whoa .
look at him .
he's huge .
it's just a scratch .
so you gonna say something or what?
let's speak in spanish , the language of our fathers .
my mother won't believe this !
no , it would be better if you didn't tell your mother about this .
why not?
i'm the one asking the questions .
now , why aren't you in school?
the man with the scar on his face .
i knew he was up to something .
you really showed that son of a bitch .
watch your mouth .
those men are killers .
whatever they had in those crates was very dangerous ... ... and now i don't know what it was , as i was too busy getting you out of trouble .
you mean this?
soap? !
that's all there was?
lots and lots of it .
are you sure?
would i lie to you?
spanish , nio , spanish , and this isn't a game .
your father would have a heart attack if he knew what you did .
no , he wouldn't , he doesn't care .
yesterday he forgot about me .
no , i don't think he forgot .
what you have to understand is ...
no .
your father should have been there .
next time he will be .
how do you know?
i know .
i promise .
thank , zorro
a serpent circling the globe .
are you sure that this is the symbol you saw on the crate?
orbis unum . " yeah .
it's latin .
it means " one world .
it represents the knights of aragon ... ... an ancient brotherhood that ruled europe in secrecy after the crusades .
wait , wait , wait .
armand is a knight?
some believe they are the masters behind all the kings in europe ... ... even today .
here is a prophecy they wrote nearly 1000 years ago .
there shall be a land in the west of great power ... ... that shall rise to threaten the serpent .
only by turning the power onto itself shall the serpent survive .
a land in the west .
america .
they want to destroy it .
with the soap?
with the soap?
thank you .
i had a wonderful time .
unfortunate that it has to end .
it does?
some colleagues of mine are arriving from europe this evening .
the meeting may run late .
perhaps we could meet for breakfast?
i cannot wait that long .
i want to be your wife , armand .
if i am going to be the lady of the house ... ... i want to start making myself at home .
i suppose we could have a late supper .
i will wait for you after your meeting .
then perhaps i can stay .
excuse me .
sir !
sir !
hotel vista grande .
what the ...?
who are you?
i'm agent pike .
this is agent harrigan .
we're the pinkertons .
operatives of the united states government .
so you are the good guys?
we live in perilous times , mr. de la vega .
america's gates have been thrown wide open ... ... to people from foreign lands .
which is why , on occasion , we require certain individuals ... ... to aid in our country's defense .
people like your ex wife .
elena?
works for you?
as a spy?
until california's statehood becomes official ... ... we don't have jurisdiction to serve armand with a search warrant .
so we needed someone who could gain his trust .
and who more suited to the task than the woman he never forgot?
before he arrived , we intercepted a telegram ... ... he'd dispatched to his associates throughout europe .
in that telegram , he claimed to be on the verge of producing a new weapon ... ... with a single target in mind .
the united states of america .
what kind of weapon could do that?
your ex wife may be on the verge to answer that question .
and every time you interfere , you jeopardize her cover .
understand?
the divorce was your idea , wasn't it?
you blackmailed elena to lure in the count ...
we prefer to think of it as a mutual understanding .
she agrees to help us ... ... and we promise to keep the name of zorro secret from his enemies .
a name you share with your wife and son .
i know something that might help you .
i will send you both to hell for this !
our country must be protected , de la vega , without apology .
zorro is a relic of the past .
this belongs in a museum .
so do you .
soon we will both be free .
hasta pronto mi amor
bonsoir , marie .
armand is expecting me .
you are early , madame .
the count is still indisposed .
well , perhaps i can wait in the parlor .
thank you so much , marie .
joaquin?
joaquin !
hey !
hey !
come here .
dad?
what are you doing in a bar?
what are you doing in jail?
i asked you first .
i went looking everywhere for you .
it's about mom .
is she okay?
no .
i mean , yes , but no .
a man came to the house .
he asked her to marry him .
she said yes .
i know you still love her .
you said you'd do anything for her .
you can't be in jail !
how can you be in jail? !
you gotta stop her .
joaquin .
joaquin , listen to me .
help me out of here , and i'll get your mother back .
we'll be a family again .
i promise .
i promise .
now ...
joaquin .
joaquin .
you are a genius , a genius .
but i don't want to catch you breaking anyone out of jail again .
without my permission , i mean .
stay back !
or i break the kid's neck !
help me !
i'm too young to die !
i got my whole life ahead of me !
kill him .
where did you learn to do that?
prison changes a man , son .
let's go .
listen , joaquin .
i have to go alone .
what?
i just got you out of jail !
what if he puts up a fight?
i'm not going there to fight .
i am going to reason with him .
you can't reason with him .
joaquin , the world is a little more complicated than you think .
no , it isn't .
there's right and wrong .
i don't have the time to argue with you .
i'm sorry .
come , joaquincito .
you don't deserve mom .
armand went through there .
we have to hurry .
i know about the pinkertons .
how?
it doesn't matter .
they told me everything .
it's all right , i forgive you .
you forgive me?
no , no .
i forgive you .
you !
for what?
everything you put me through .
you?
i would not be in this mess if you had kept your mask on .
really?
then why are you still wearing his necklace?
i'm undercover .
besides , these are pearls .
you never gave me pearls .
you said you didn't care about that .
i lied .
every woman loves pearls .
well , now you have them , princess .
when i said that we were never meant to be together , i meant it .
finally we agree on something .
this changes nothing .
absolutely not .
follow me .
always .
orbis unum .
orbis unum .
fellow knights of aragon ... ... soon the power of the united states will be so great ... ... it will overshadow us .
lts people .
they are divided by north and south .
a civil war is inevitable .
the only question is , who will claim victory?
we will determine the outcome ...
an average bar of soap .
quite harmless in its current form .
but science has shown us how to extract the glycerin ... ... and transform it into a compound ... ... 13 times more powerful than gunpowder .
nitroglycerin .
for months , this vineyard has been a cover for its manufacture .
tomorrow , a shipment of nitro will depart by train .
it will be met at the state line by colonel beauregard ... ... who will take possession of the shipment ... ... and distribute it throughout the confederate army .
as we speak ... ... they're preparing to launch ... ... a preemptive strike against washington ... ... forever tearing this country apart .
gentlemen , the knights of aragon ... ... will soon be restored to our former glory ... ... as we stand in shadow and watch america destroy itself !
i've heard enough .
brothers , you know my spirit is with you .
but we risk antagonizing a sleeping giant if we fail .
i'll see myself out .
lord dillingham .
would a demonstration put your mind at ease?
unless you come to confess ... ... you have no business here , mcgivens .
funny you should mention confession , padre ... ... seeing that you're obliged to keep the secrets of your flock .
joaquincito , go back inside !
who's zorro?
you know , zorro could be anyone at all .
come on , now .
we're both men of god .
you can tell me .
hey , boss .
lord hates a liar .
all right , i'll tell you .
run !
felipe !
you killed felipe !
gentlemen ... ... the future .
this facility will provide a continuous supply of nitro ... ... to the southern battlefront .
i'll be returning to europe shortly ... ... but ferroq will remain to oversee the operation .
the nitro has been concealed in these bottles ... ... to circumvent any prying northern patrol .
an urgent matter requires your attention at the hacienda .
he's going back to the hacienda .
i have to get back before he does .
i'll keep the train from leaving .
go .
elena .
be careful .
armand .
my goodness , i must have dozed off and your dogs startled me .
perhaps they thought you were someone you're not .
i'm told you arrived early .
i could not wait .
i'm having a special meal prepared .
i hope you're hungry .
i'm famished .
thank you , marie .
you are not hungry?
tasty , is it?
it's unusual .
is it quail?
pigeon .
as you said , elena ... ... we see the people we love as we wish them to be ... ... not as who they really are .
did you actually think ... ... that i would be swept off my feet by a sadistic coward like you?
i thought you were a woman of vision .
vision . " i could barely stomach the sight of you , armand .
the only way i could bear your touch was to imagine you were alejandro .
your stepfather would be ashamed .
you've become nothing more than a common woman ... ... devoted to a common man .
i take that as a compliment .
mama !
oh , joaquin !
padre's dead and the kid's a witness .
no , no , no .
we'll need the next batch of it .
put some more here now .
we'll rendezvous at clanton's pass .
you and your men can assume control of the train there .
zorro !
zorro !
no !
if you please .
remove his mask .
you . papi !!!
you've lost it all .
your wife .
your son .
and for what?
for this?
no matter where you go , armand ... ... whatever you do ... ... the world isn't big enough to hide from me .
goodbye , de la vega .
no !
armand , no !
papi ! no
please .
not in front of joaquin .
please .
as soon as we're gone .
elena .
my family is my life .
shame about your friend the padre .
but he died with god's name on his lips ... ... and a bullet in his heart .
and now i send you out , a sheep amongst wolves .
thank god ... ... you're alive .
i already did .
listen , go to the marshal's office ... ... and tell them what armand is doing here .
where are you going?
to catch a train .
can i get you something to drink?
you can lock me in a tower forever ... ... and i will never stop hating you .
you may feel differently when you see how joaquin enjoys ... ... the life of an aristocrat .
i can't wait till my papi kicks your ...
joaquin !
zorro !
zorro , zorro !
don't touch him !
guards !
good boy .
well done .
let's see how much your father truly loves you .
get the boy !
joaquin , quick .
keep going .
what are you doing?
when the car stops , get off and follow the tracks back to town .
you are the son of zorro .
you can do it .
now , go .
how did you get in here?
so the devil will know who sent you .
the drinks are on me .
my fellow californians ... ... we have gathered here at historic bear point ... ... to make official our entrance into the united states of america !
bravo !
vamos tornado !!
welcome to the union , governor .
look at you .
a real heartbreaker , huh?
dad?
yeah?
why didn't you tell me who you are?
come here .
joaquin ... ... when you were born , i vowed i would give my life to keep you safe .
i thought i could protect you by hiding the truth .
but your mother was right .
it wasn't my secret to keep .
it belongs to all of us .
so i promise i will never lie to you again .
never .
i bless these rings in the name of the father , the son and the holy spirit .
elena ... ... receive this ring as a sign of my love and fidelity .
alejandro ... ... receive this ring as a sign of my love and fidelity .
today you join in the fullness of time for all eternity .
yea , seeketh tolerance when easily provoked .
love endureth , for it keeps no score of wrongs .
love bears all things and believes all things .
love endures day by day ... ... hour by hour ... ... minute by minute .
padre .
love is patient ...
padre .
can you hurry it up a little?
the people are calling .
it's who we are .
do you want her back?
of course i do .
and you take him?
lf i must .
you may now kiss the bride .
again .
don't wait up .
never .
