poor aunt , she's so dumb .
we're gonna get all her stones , right dad?
listen , brat !
i won't rest until every single stone is in san bartolo .
but they're ours , aren't they?
shut up !
don't tell me the lady's been thrashing you !
my god !
you're hurt .
come , take a seat .
easy now .
i'll get you some medicine .
can i have your newspaper?
here's the healing medicine .
see what young girls are up to nowadays !
it's done .
try not to touch the wound .
can you get me another mezcal?
get me more pulque , son !
juan lopez perez , at your service .
i'm the judge's deputy .
congratulations !
thank you .
who's gonna sing us another song?
come on ...
give her a hug , man !
is the pulque alright , sir?
it's very good .
vicente , what are the lady's nephew's plans regarding her house?
you know who i mean , that fatso with the dumb gringo cap .
juan luis .
you're drunk !
juan luis from san bartolo?
if i'd known i wouldn't have asked , shithead !
i'm sorry , senator .
i'm quite pissed off .
but not with you .
san bartolo is the village in the middle of the canyon?
yes .
and juan luis works with the butcher?
yes .
senora .
they're taking the house tomorrow .
senora , you're being conned .
in the early afternoon .
that man has no right to this house .
how long have you lived here?
it was his grandfather's .
how many years have you lived in this house?
only about 40 .
then it's yours , no one can take it from you .
juan luis won't take my house , he just wants the stones .
he needs them more than i do .
i don't mind .
what do you mean you don't mind !
you said your hut wouldn't resist the april winds without the barn !
i'm not a greedy person .
why are you crying then?
because i know what i want .
you haven't a clue of what you want .
only yesterday i heard juan luis 'sons mocking you .
shut up , please .
i'm doing laundry .
shall i wash your clothes?
good afternoon , senora .
good afternoon , fernando .
just a little favour , would you undo my shoelaces?
my daughter is up the hill , looking after her aunt's sheep .
they asked for her help 'cause there's a lot to do .
i never deny my daughter's services .
i lend her .
you might see her up there , near your house .
yes , fernando .
i might .
thanks .
have a good day .
see you later , god willing .
senora !
senora , please excuse my harshness this morning .
oh sir !
i know you're only trying to help .
have you seen the sunset , ascen?
the best things in life can't be bought , right?
i really couldn't say , but it's great you found my blouse .
it was a present from sabi .
sure , sure .
ascen , i want to make you a proposal ... to explain something to you .
fine , but first tell me why you came to this place .
alright .
to be calm .
cause there's a lot of trouble in the city?
yeah .
but it isn't just that .
much serenity is necessary to leave behind the things we're used to and don't really like anymore .
we must learn to dispose of what's useless .
but it's better to fix things than throw them out .
sure , but certain things can't be fixed .
disposing of them is better than clinging to them out of habit .
i think i understand , sir .
but you know , sir ... even though i don't like my sick , old arms ,
i wouldn't chop them off .
sure , i get you .
by the way , what was it you wanted to tell me?
yes , the proposal .
listen , i'd like you to hear some music and then i'll tell you .
ascen ...
senora ...
is it almost over?
i want to tell you what it's about .
let me listen a little more .
is it over?
tell me now what you wanted to tell me .
take off the earphones .
remember i told you how i need a lot of ... serenity in order to make a decision?
sure , all about disposing of things .
more or less .
i know you're an elderly person from a remote canyon ... and this might sound a bit strange .
but in fact ... it's totally normal if you think for a while .
tell me now what you have to say !
forgive me , but i don't follow you .
don't worry .
while searching for that serenity , other emotions came up , other instincts .
what i would like is to have intercourse with you .
there's more to it than that , but that's what it is .
i'd like to if you'd like to .
free intercourse?
pardon?
you tell me .
well ... sexual intercourse .
it's important for me now .
but don't you see i'm very old?
i don't mind .
weren't you in a hurry to leave?
i will go tomorrow for good .
but first i need this .
so you want to fornicate me right now?
it doesn't have to be right now .
before the end of tomorrow?
that's fine .
thank you , senora .
i'd like it to be tomorrow , ok?
whenever you like .
good night .
good night .
peace be with you .
peace be with you .
lie down , senora .
come closer .
now turn around , please .
may i keep touching you like this?
you must come closer .
now turn around .
you must lift yourself up .
come closer .
a bit more .
fine .
now turn around .
put your knee here .
lift that up .
your other knee here .
do lift up .
lift up !
now get on your knees .
on your knees .
on your knees !
as if ... fine .
further back now .
better if you turn around .
what's going on?
how dare you take the lady's house from her?
you fucking bunch of cowards !
how could you leave her like that?
shut up , sir !
what's going on here?
don't shout here !
get him out of here , senora !
go back to where you belong , foreigner !
get out of here !
and calm down !
silence !
you shouldn't have hurt him , now he's crippled .
back to where he belongs !
come on , get to work !
and sweat !
pull hard now !
here's some more pulque .
thanks , young man !
you're falling asleep .
who's gonna get us the drinks?
they don't give us much .
the people from ... from the film .
shut up .
you shut up , dumb ass .
have some tea , sir .
it's hot .
drink up !
thanks .
i'm pretty drunk now !
no thanks .
you?
have some tea .
i'm very grateful ... ... for everything .
a little drink for you .
tomorrow we'll have pulque .
is it good?
it's good .
cheers .
thank you , and god bless you .
you just gave me some , aunt ascen .
i've had enough .
thanks a lot .
you're neglecting me .
some tea?
you're neglecting me .
sing " wedding ring " for us .
hold on .
easy .
go on , it's good !
don't you like it?
it's too strong !
stop , or you'll be drunk !
your wife won't love you anymore .
is she still waiting for you?
you'll go home to an empty house !
sing us a song now .
wedding ring " .
just like a mariachi .
i'll sing along .
fine .
you start .
wedding ring , which i put on your finger ...
i better leave now !
she must leave now !
wedding ring ... our love's chain ...
he's really plastered .
his wife will give him shit .
you are my life ...
you are my destiny ...
and my tenderness ...
is worth my honour .
wedding ring ...
come on , man !
we're singing along .
sing along , you too !
all you do is drink .
don't cry .
i shed my tears ... because i know , and i can ... sing them to you .
sing !
i carved your name on the maguey's bark ... together side by side ... two hearts together ... you know that my heart ... is so big .
and i'm proud ... from the bottom of my heart .
now you say you don't care ... because you've been told ... the story of my love .
and now you know ... that i'm at peace ... because you wanted ... to be my sweetheart .
lift !
turn around .
you forgot this stone , dear .
thanks , aunt .
gasparin !
put this stone where it belongs , you swine !
put it on the truck .
aunt , warm up some tacos .
there's still plenty of work to be done .
there's a lot to do !
please , aunt .
yes , juan .
she's goddam crazy , my aunt .
what now , son?
the truck's full , we'll need two trips .
doesn't matter .
i've paid and it's only gonna be one trip !
it's a lot of weight !
do as i tell you .
i'm paying for all of this .
go !
i'm fucking plastered .
work'll be a bitch tomorrow .
you worked damn well , aunt .
ascen !
i only took it for the trip down .
sure ...
it's cold .
i'll be back in a jiffy .
pardon the inconvenience .
start it up , marcos .
hold on ...
it's just a fucking cat .
now you can start it up !
goodbye , aunt !
wait !
wait for her !
