if one night i didn't come to see you , what would you do?
i'd try not to expect you .
yes , but if it got late and ...
i hadn't shown up?
then i'd think there must be a reason .
you wouldn't come to find me?
hmm .

then i'd tell myself , he spends all day searching .
in the night , he wants to be found .

kip?
kip?
kip !
and my heart beats so that i can hardly speak
and i seem to find the happiness i seek
hey , we're goin 'home !
when we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
it's raining .
and the cares that hung around me through the week
seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
when we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
oh , i love to climb a mountain
and to reach the highest peak
but it doesn't thrill me half as much
as dancing cheek to cheek
kip , come and dance with us .
later .
oh , come on .
clap now .
yeah .
here comes the bomb squad !
hey , let me handle it !
go on , sergeant hardy !
bring 'em home !
hardy !
hardy !
hardy !
what was that?
i'm never going to forgive myself .
i'm never going to bloody forgive myself .
sergeant hardy , sir .
it was booby trapped .
they was runnin 'up the union jack , sir , up on that statue .
it just went off , sir .
sergeant hardy climbed up , sir , just for a lark , sir .
it should've been me .
it was my idea .
sir , you don't wanna look .
ooh .
who's that girl?
his fiancee , sir .
hardy's?
he kept it a bit dark .
kip?
kip , it's me .
i'm so sorry about what happened .
can i talk to you?
kip?
kip , why won't you talk to me?
oh , kip .
oh , let me come in !
hana tells me you're leaving .
there's going to be trials .
they want me to interpret .
don't they know i'm allergic to courtrooms?
so ...
i come across the hospital convoy .
they're looking for this stuff .
this nurse , mary , tells me about you and hana ... hiding in some monastery in
what do you call it?
retreat?
how you came out of the desert ... and you were burned and you didn't remember your name , but you knew the words to every song that ever was ... and you had one possession : a copy of herodotus .
and it was filled ... with letters and cuttings .
then i knew it was you .
me?
i saw you ... writing in that book at the embassy in cairo ... when i had thumbs and you had a face ... and a name .
i see .
before you went over to the germans , before you found a way to get rommel's spy across the desert and inside british headquarters .
he took some pretty good photographs .
i saw mine in that torture room in tobruk .
so , it made an impression .
i had to get back to the desert .
i'd made a promise .
the rest meant nothing to me .
what did you say?
that the rest ... meant nothing to me .
there was a result to what you did .
it wasn't just another expedition .
it did this .
if the british hadn't unearthed that photographer , thousands of people could have died .
thousands of people did die .
just different people .
yes , like madox .
what?
you know he shot himself , your partner ,
when he found out you were a spy .
what?
madox thought i was a spy?
no .
no , i was never a spy .
it's ghastly .
it's like a witch hunt .
anybody remotely foreign is suddenly a spy .
so watch out .
right .
we didn't care about countries , did we?
brits , arabs , hungarians , germans
none of that mattered , did it?
it was something finer than that .
yes , it was .
i'll leave the plane in kufra oasis .
so , if you need it  right .
hard to know how long one's talking about .
we might all be back in a month or two .
hmm .
i have to teach myself not to read too much into everything .
it comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all .
goodbye , my friend .
there is no god .
but i hope someone looks after you .
in case you're still wondering , this is called a suprasternal notch .
come and visit us in dorset when all this nonsense is over .
you'll never come to dorset .
so , you didn't know madox shot himself .
no .
and you didn't kill the cliftons?
sh
she
she die
she i can't .
well , maybe i did .
maybe i did .
i was packing up our base camp ... at the cave of swimmers .
clifton had offered to fly down from cairo to collect me .
he flew like a madman always , so i i took no notice .
aaah !
katharine?
dear god , katharine , what are you doing here?
i can't get out .
i can't move .
surprise , " he said .
poor geoffrey .
he knew .
he must've known all the time .
he was shouting , " i love you , katharine .
i love you so much .
is he badly hurt?
i have to get you out .
please don't move me .
i have to get you out .
it hurts too much .
i know , darling , i know .
i'm sorry .
come on .
now !
why did you hate me?
what?
don't you know you drove everybody mad?
shh .
don't talk .
you speak so many bloody languages ... and you never want to talk .
you're wearing the thimble .
of course .
you idiot .
i always wear it .
i've always worn it .
i've always loved you .
it's so cold .
i know .
i'm sorry .
i'll make a fire .
did you get geoffrey out of the plane?
yes , i did .
good .
that's good .
thank you .
listen to me , katharine .
you've broken your ankle ... and i'm going to have to try and bind it .
i think you've also broken your wrist ... and maybe some ribs , which is why it's hurting you to breathe .
i'm going to have to walk to el taj .
although , given all the traffic in the desert these days ,
i'm bound to bump into one army or another .
and then i'll come back and you'll be fine .
you promise?
i wouldn't want to die here .
i don't want to die in the desert .
i've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind .
particular hymns .
and i know exactly where i want to be buried .
in our garden , where i grew up ... with a view of the sea .
so promise me you'll come back for me .
i promise ...
i'll come back for you .
i promise ...
i'll never leave you .
you have plenty of water ... and , um , food .
i'll open them for you .
a good read .
don't waste this .
will you bury geoffrey?
i know he's dead .
i'm sorry , katharine .
i know .
every night ...
i cut out my heart .
but in the morning it was full again .
darling .
my darling .
you'd better be ready about half past 8 : 00
now , honey don't you be late
i'm going to be there when the band starts playing
remember when we get there , honey
an invitation to the strutter's ball
a very swell affair
all the highbrows will be there
i'll be down to get you in a taxi , honey
i stopped at noon and at twilight .
three days there on foot , i told her , and three hours back by car .
don't go anywhere .
i'll be back .
i'll be back .
just walked in from the desert , sir .
morning .
dear golly , where have you come from then?
there's been an accident .
i need a doctor ... to come with me , and i need to borrow this car .
i'll pay , of course .
and i need i need morphine .
may i see your papers , sir?
what?
if i could just see some form of identification .
i'm sorry , i'm not making sense .
forgive me , i i'm not
i've been walking and
a woman is badly injured at the gilf kabir , the cave of swimmers .
i'm a member of the royal geographical society .
right .
now , if i could ... just take your name .
count laszlo de almasy .
almasy . " would you mind spelling that for me?
look , listen to me , will you?
what nationality would that be?
a woman is dying .
my wife is dying .
i have been ... walking
i have been walking for three days .
i do not want to spell my name .
i want you to give me this car .
i understand you're agitated .
perhaps if you'd like to sit down , i can radio back to hq .
no .
no , don't don't radio anybody !
just give me the fucking car !
stop the car , please .
a woman is dying !
listen , fritz , if i have to listen to another word from you ,
i'm going to give you a fucking good hiding !
fritz?
what are you talking about , fritz?
well , that's your name , isn't it?
count fuckin 'asshole von bismarck !
what's that supposed to be , irish?
please !
you have to listen !
katharine !
katharine !
excuse me .
i also need to use the lavatory .
you'll have to wait .
it's urgent .
sarge !
sarge , jerry wants to use the lav .
says it's urgent .
where are we going , please?
oh , up north to the coast .
benghazi .
soon be there .
you can get your boat back home then .
all right , go on then .
here , you take him .
i've been up and down this bloody train all day .
it doesn't open .
aaah !
so yes , she died because of me .
because i loved her .
because i
because i had the wrong name .
and you never got back to the cave?
i did get back .
i kept my promise .
i was assisted by the germans .
there was a a trade .
i had our expedition maps .
and after the british made me their enemy ,
i gave their enemy our maps .
so i got back to the desert ... and to katharine ... in madox's english plane ... with german gasoline .
when i arrived in italy , on my medical chart they wrote ,
english patient .
isn't that funny?
after all that , i became english .
you get to the morning and the poison leaks away , doesn't it?
black nights .
i thought i would kill you .
you can't kill me .
i died years ago .
no , i can't kill you now .
we've been posted .
north of florence .
i was thinking yesterday yesterday
the patient and hardy .
they're everything that's good about england .
i couldn't even say what that was .
we didn't exchange two personal words , and we've been together through some terrible things .
some terrible things .
he was engaged to a girl in the village .
i mean
and us , he never once
he didn't ask me if i could spin the ball at cricket or kama sutra or
i don't even know what i'm talking about .
you loved him .
katharine .
i'm still here .
you'd better be .
don't depend on it , will you?
that little bit of air in my lungs , each day it gets less and less .
which is all right .
it's quite all right .
i've been speaking to caravaggio , my research assistant .
he tells me there's a ghost in the cloisters .
i can join him .
hana !
it's the boy .
i'll always go back to that church .
look at my paintings .
i'll always go back to that church .
so one day we'll meet .
thank you .
read to me , will you?
read me to sleep .
my darling ,
i'm waiting for you .
how long is a day in the dark?
or a week?
the fire is gone now ... and i'm horr horribly cold .
i really ought to drag myself outside , but then there'd be the sun .
i'm afraid i waste the light ... on the paintings and on writing these words .
we die .
we die .
we die rich with lovers and tribes ,
tastes we have swallowed ,
bodies we have entered ... and swum up like rivers .
fears we've hidden in ,
like this wretched cave .
i want all this marked on my body .
we're the real countries .
not the boundaries drawn on maps , the names of powerful men .
i know you'll come and carry me out into the palace of winds .
that's all i've wanted , to walk in such a place with you , with friends .
an earth without maps .
the lamp's gone out ,
and i'm writing ... in the darkness .
hana?
hana , come on !
hana , this is gioia .
buon giorno .
buon giorno .
she'll take you as far as florence .
i can get in back .
