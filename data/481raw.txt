the axe gang boss is napping in there .
whoever wants to die , step forward .

we'll go one on one .
don't even think about cheating .
that old woman with the onion !
you look real tough .

i'll let you hit me first .
what do you do?
i'm a farmer .
farmers don't fight .

we're the bad guys !
we're meant to do the ass kicking ... ... not the other way around .
and it's all because these morons posed as axes .

i'll count to three .

that's quick !
brother sum , we really want to be axes .
that's why we did what we did .
give us a chance .
ever killed anyone?
i've always thought about it .
then go kill someone .
i will !
go on !
thank you , brother sum .
we can always find a use for that type .
i told you before , you've got to look tough .
tougher !
tougher !
act the part .
and try to stay awake .
it's tiring being tough .
tiring?
it's our living !
the streets out there are filled with money and women .
you only need the will and determination ... ... to seize the opportunity to win .
this is our big chance !
we just kill someone , and we're in the gang .
then it'll be money and women all the way !
don't be like those beggars ... ... with no ambition .
who are you looking at , four eyes?
i'll smash your glasses !
get lost !
come here and say that !
you're really gonna kill someone?
that's right !
the four eyes , the fat woman and all the residents of pig sty .
but they're good at kung fu .
i can do kung fu !
oh , yeah?
didn't i tell you i know buddhist palm kung fu?
hey there , handsome boy .
stop .
amazing !
do you know you have a special aura?
you're so young , but you have the bone structure ... and chi flow of a kung fu genius .
if your chi flow can be channeled , then you will be invincible !
you cannot escape your destiny .
the duty of upholding world peace and punishing evil will be yours .
sure .
this is the scroll of the buddhist palm .
it's priceless .
but as it's fate , i'll let you have it for $ 10 .
buddhlst palm manual
you gave him your life savings?
yes .
i was saving to study to be a doctor or lawyer ... ... but this was world peace .
let go of the girl !
hey !
it's the buddhist palm !
the 20 cent kung fu manual .
you must be loaded .
have you killed anyone lately?
he's a fool , and she's mute .
losers !
i realized then that good guys never win .
i want to be bad .
i want to be the killer !
ice cream !
where?
make mine a vanilla .
chocolate for me !
what're you looking at?
never seen free ice cream before?
look at her run !
you're such kung fu masters , go take it on the road .
you belong in the circus , not here !
don't say that , landlady .
there must be a reason they're here .
everyone has his reasons .
we don't want to make trouble .
i'm glad you get it .
the mob's mad at us .
we'll never hear the end of it .
why don't you get lost !
your wife shouldn't be so nasty .
you okay?
masters .
we have nothing precious to give you ... ... but take this as a token of our appreciation .
thanks for saving us !
stop the crying .
this isn't a show !
you're so cold hearted .
talking back to me , eh?
you may know kung fu , but you're still a fairy .
it's no crime to be good at kung fu !
once a fairy , always a fairy .
look at you .
what's with the red underwear?
why not a diaper while you're at it .
what's wrong with red underwear?
where were you when there was trouble?
if it weren't for them , we'd be finished .
be reasonable !
i'll reason with you .
you owe me three months 'rent .
that's $90 .
pay up or pack up !
don't you worry .
i'll pay it .
think you're a smartass , rabbit tooth jane?
what's it to you , tub of lard?
bitch !
calm down , landlady .
this is your fault .
are you trying to kill us?
you're right .
how could you do that?
shut the hell up !
you think you can out yell me?
the fat lady can really sing .
watch this !
what happened?
what do you mean , what happened?
you try it .
me?
quick !
sorry !
you okay?
i think you should get closer and take better aim .
okay?
okay !
who's throwing the handles?
handle?
where's the third knife?
god knows where it went .
could it be the same one?
can't be ...
don't !
sorry .
what are you trying to say?
i just remembered i have something to do .
see you !
uh oh .
they've seen us !
stay back !
don't panic !
snakes like music .
if i whistle , they won't bite .
please , no more bright ideas .
oh , what the hell !
not you again , asshole !
get back to your business !
split up !
split?
what're you doing here?
looking for you .
weren't you hurt?
i'm fine !
how come you always recover so fast?
i don't know .
which hospital did you go to?
don't remember .
maybe it's better that way .
memories can be painful .
to forget may be a blessing !
i never knew you were so deep .
all the sadness one can bear ...
... down the river everywhere .
hey , get out of the way !
move !
i'll slap you to kingdom come !
look at those four eyes carting around a coffin .
what morons !
don't blame me for making you leave .
we'll let buddha decide ... ... whether you stay ... ... or go .
horrlfically bad fate
have some tea .
we're grateful for some professional help .
we understand the problem .
twelve kicks from the tam school ... ... iron fist from the hung school and the hexagon staff ...
those guys at pig sty are really good .
their warrior days are long over ... ... but they're still top fighters .
this job is a great challenge for us .
now , that's professionalism .
number one killers .
expensive , yes , but worth every penny !
no !
number one is the beast , the world's top killer .
he was so dedicated to kung fu , he went crazy .
i heard he's now in an asylum .
so you're the top killers now .
strictly speaking , we're just musicians .
a song that wrenches the heart o where do i find a knowing ear?
great poem , isn't it?
we'll be saying goodbye soon .
who knows when we'll see each other again .
we're three of a kind .
wish we'd known before .
let's take this opportunity to spar a little .
no .
we still have a lot to pack .
you're right .
twelve kicks of the tam school !
superb attack and defense !
powerful yet delicate .
topnotch !
hexagon staff , with its thousand moves .
mystical !
till we meet again !
more lipstick !
stay there , or i'll break you in half .
sorry , we're closed .
you can make a suit in no time .
we're moving .
this is good material !
you know your stuff .
this has high artistic value .
how high?
at least a few stories ...
insulting the axe gang !
we'll show them .
let's kill them all and make this place a brothel .
don't block my view !
what's going on?
good !
don't block my view !
damn !
i told those nitwits to leave , but they're still here .
really?
yeah .
what the hell is this fighting?
who'll pay for the damage?
sorry , sorry .
it's nothing !
you know what time it is?
i have to sleep .
hey , fatso , eat shit and die !
die?
in this racket?
sorry , sorry !
get out of my way !
hang in there , tailor .
be quiet !
give us a break !
why push us so far?
there's another master?
it's the lion's roar !
i thought that was a myth .
who knew the lion's roar really exists?
that's the last we'll see of them .
it's bad , brother sum .
quick , start the car !
start the car !
boss !
keep it down !
have you no manners?
get lost .
people are trying to sleep .
they have to work tomorrow .
get out of here !
scumbags !
i can't hang on much longer .
but having seen real masters like you ... ... i can now die in peace .
don't say that .
we're ordinary folks .
ordinary's a blessing .
don't call us masters .
but you're such great fighters !
if only you'd helped earlier , they wouldn't have to die this way .
like donut said , everyone has his reasons .
years ago ... ... we saw our only son killed in a fight .
revenge can be devastating .
do you understand?
why don't you train us to be top fighters ... ... and we'll avenge them !
becoming a top fighter takes time .
unless you're a natural born kung fu genius .
and they're one in a million .
it's obvious i'm the one !
don't think so .
everyone !
we swore we'd never fight again .
but we broke that promise today .
for your own safety , please all leave !
in great power lies great responsibility .
there's no escaping from it .
donut , you're hurt bad .
rest now .
we can't understand what you're saying .
donut !
i know you , four eyes !
you seem prejudiced against the sight challenged .
that's right .
especially gold framed four eyes .
gold frames are perfect for clerks .
i think i look good .
so why keep picking on me?
help me !
help me !
help me !
want to play , punks?
the dragon style?
the tiger style?
come down here , and i'll smash your glasses .
come on !
you know i'd do it , right?
swear to it !
swear !
have you no respect?
where were you when i needed you?
you sound like a wimp !
we always get beat !
we haven't gotten anywhere .
no killing , no arson , no robberies , no rapes ... ... all because of you !
you're a numb nut !
follow me !
it's a stickup !
where's the money?
where's the money?
what're you looking at?
i'm serious !
i kill people for less !
give me the money .
the money's in here .
let go of the girl !
he's a fool , and she's mute .
losers !
go away !
you're dragging me down !
go home and raise pigs .
go , before i kill you .
you !
whatsyourname !
take this and get some new clothes .
you're now an axe !
for real?
someone's waiting for you .
brother sum !
one look at you , and i knew you'd do anything .
right !
you just needed your chance .
damn right !
we've an assignment for you .
anything , brother sum !
research on abnormal people .
what's that?
a mental asylum .
soldiers !
boy scouts !
tanks !
no worries .
when the boy scouts change shifts , you have exactly five minutes .
follow the arrows on the map .
go to the last cell ... ... and get the man inside there out .
here's your tools .
what about you guys?
we're your lookouts .
five minutes .
hurry !
the world's top killer indeed looks the part !
it's only a title .
cut the bullshit .
we want two people killed .
name your price .
name my what?
i've killed so many trying to find a worthy adversary .
so far , i've never found one .
that's why i stayed inside .
had i met my match , i'd have been out long ago .
if you find me a worthy opponent ... ... i'll do it for free .
no charge !
do you have someone?
yes .
brilliant fighters who are up to the challenge .
but first , will you show us some moves?
not that we don't trust you .
we want to see you in action .
you numskulls aren't worthy !
he doesn't look the part .
the slippers are a little crappy .
but he'll clean up well .
you sure you got the right guy?
absolutely .
i swear i did exactly what you told me .
please show us some moves , mr. beast .
don't make it hard for me !
you dumb or what?
you know what this is , old man?
ever seen a fist this big?
don't force me to fight .
i scare myself when i fight !
really?
try me , then .
is he okay?
so you say you can fight?
harder !
harder !
harder !
you hit like that and call yourself a gangster?
a foreign gun !
in the world of kung fu , speed defines the winner .
the beast is the best of them all .
the axe gang extends its respect !
the real masters , together in one room !
only the world's top killer ... ... has such an aura .
likewise .
could you two be the fated lovers ...?
paris ... ... and helen of troy !
a pleasure , indeed .
we're here to deal with the axe gang ... ... and only the axe gang .
you should've killed me before .
now you're committing suicide .
you're living on borrowed time .
you can't escape your fate !
what's this?
a funeral bell?
with the beast here , let's see whose funeral it is !
so you're on their side?
don't get me wrong .
i only want to kill you ... ... or be killed by you .
what do you think?
the good cannot coexist with the bad .
you can't escape your destiny .
so be it .
let's do it .
okay .
let's do it !
piece of cake .
i can handle this .
good try , but a little off target .
the lion's roar?
wait !
i didn't know the lion's roar could be done with a speaker !
what a blow !
looks like they're not up to it !
let's get them while they're down .
you do it !
i'm gonna puke !
i need to see a doctor !
go to hell !
you !
come over here .
hit him !
yes !
the head !
of course !
hit him on the head !
okay .
here's your chance .
got it !
hit him !
hit him !
hit the shit out of him !
right !
hit him !
hit him !
beat the shit out of him !
what're you doing?
you want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him?
you're making me very confused !
wow , that's a big fist !
why did you hit me?
where are they?
how could you let them escape?
no one gets away from me !
why did he save us?
young people make mistakes .
but at least he finally made good .
look at him !
beaten to a pulp .
do you have any last requests?
hey , wait !
why don't you write in chinese?
i don't understand .
there's no one here !
chlnese medlcine
it's a miracle he lasted this long .
the herbs should help him .
herbal medicine can only partly help .
the key is his own body structure .
all his bones and tendons are broken .
it's amazing he's recovering so fast .
it can't be possible ...
unless he's ...
what's that smell?
you mustn't smoke while you're hurt .
let me handle this .
this makes no sense .
who knew the beast could clear the chi flow ... ... and thus unleash the boy's true potential?
we should've guessed .
he is the one !
is this for real?
you're still alive , you turncoat?
kill him , men !
what kind of move is that?
kids 'stuff !
if our son were alive , he'd be his age now .
if he studies hard , he could grow up to be a doctor or lawyer .
a stuntman , more likely !
not bad .
let's go .
i can even stop bullets ...
what?
the toad style of the kwan lun school?
oh , no !
remember the palm move that falls from heaven?
that's the long lost buddhist palm .
i surrender !
what kind of move was that?
if you want to learn , i'll teach you .
master !
hey !
tell him not to put snot on the glass .
you two , put your pants on !
no licking if you're not buying !
kid , you have the bone structure of a kung fu genius .
world peace is in your hands .
here's the scroll of the buddhist palm .
because it's fate , i'll let you have it for $ 10 .
wait !
you want more ...?
