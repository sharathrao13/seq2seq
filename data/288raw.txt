... there has been no coming by either goverment .
president drag as stand in the past , but this is a matter of great importance to france .
rescue workers have just reached the scene of the crash of zarig flight 370 .
fligth 370 caring 210 passengers .
and the crew took off at 7 o'clock this morning and was due to land in paris .
first reports are that due do not appear to be any survivors .
the aircraft went down 70 kilometers from beograde and it's too early to determine the cause of the accident .
however the weather was clear and there were no distress signals from the cocpit .
there are uncorfirmed reports , that the notorious war criminal slobovan pavlov , was one of the passenger on board .
according to our source from interpol it's believed that pavlov one of the world terorists including the mass murder of hundreds of bosnian civillians was travelling with a false passport .
if this is true ... it would be an ironic end to one of the biggest madness in european history .
join us for the next update at six o'clock .
