which is to say , dressing like a boy
now he thinks he can take other pets a peg down
hey , i'm a dog who's learned to keep his leg down
i gotta be a boy
he's so over just being rover
gotta be a boy

gotta be a boy
a boy and nothing but a boy
nothing but a boy
don't you think you're stretching?
quit your kvetching
gotta be a boy
spot , you can fake it , but you'll never be a boy
but soft , could what he said be true?
ls this really just a phase i'm going through?
i sure hope so .
shall i go back to serving man?
eat wholesome dinners from a can?
who needs french and scoring goals?
come on , let's bark and dig some holes
what am i , nuts?
leonard , wake up and smell the kibble !
i gotta be a boy
spot , sit and stay now what did you say now?
he's gotta be a boy
i've got to be it's not to be
i long to be you're wrong to be
it's great to be great trait to be
we'd hate to be can't wait to be
my mate to be too late to be
it's my fate to be
a boy
a dog
a boy , a boy a dog , a dog
a boy , boy , boy dog , dog , dog , dog
boy dog

now , students of the , uh , um ....
fourth grade , principal strickler .
but soon to be fifth grade !
that's why i'm glad i'm a principal .
none of this messy student/ teacher involvement .
they grow , they leave good riddance .
but i suppose it is just that sort of ... bushy gushy loving teacher stuff ... that leads to this announcement .
hmph !
mrs. mary lou helperman , you have been selected ... as a finalist for the teacher of the year award !
neato !
that's right , it's the n. e. a. t. o. the national excellent american teacher organization award !

florida !
and the fun doesn't end there , mary lou helperman .
oh , no .
because you'll be travelling ... to the sunshine state in the luxury ... of my very own personal air conditioned wentawaygo !

i only have one , uh , heh , little , tiny , very simple rule
certainly , principal strickler .
absolutely no dogs are allowed in my wentawaygo , ever !
i iate dogs !
well , i guess this is the time to say good bye .
oh , come on , don't make it harder .

they're the only eyes i got , leonard .
the eyes of a dog a dog who's not going anywhere .
just staying home ...
by himself ... here ... alone !
the dog .
but you're not going to be alone .
you've got pretty boy and jolly ... and mrs. boogin's the nicest pet sitter in the whole world .
and besides , it's only for two weeks .
yeah , in boy time , two weeks ... but everything in dog time is seven times longer ... so for me it's fourteen weeks .
it might as well be forever .
man , this really stinks .
you should smell it from down here .
ok , just two weeks , then i'm back ... and it's you and me , best friends ... together , all summer long .

hey , smart boy , let me explain how tv works .
we can hear them , but they can't hear us .
i've got to meet that man .
he's the one chance i have to finally make ... my lifelong dream come true !

what's your dream?
well , heh heh heh ...
i guess maybe i should've mentioned it earlier ... but see , there was this ...
... and changed to that ...
... and concerned ...
and that's the real reason i had to come to florida .
oh .
i get it .
i thought you came to be with me ... but you really just came for the ride .
no , i did come to be with you ... and for the ride .
aw , please , lenny !
i gotta have a shot at my dream .
i don't know .
it all sounds so wacko .
anyway , you're not supposed to be a boy .
you're supposed to be my dog .
oh , don't give me the eyes .
no , not the sad walk away .
forget it .
no .
oh , all right .
we'll find this dr. krank guy .
but as soon as you see that i'm right and he's nuts ... we'll march right back here ... you'll be a dog , i'll throw a stick ... and we'll make my summer dream come true !
good boy .

we return the spotlight to that wacko scientist ... who claims he can turn animals human
dr. lvan krank !
wacko , wacko , wacko !
jolly , that's the guy spot went to see !
but why is barry anger returning the spotlight to that wacko?
why , you ask , am i returning my spotlight to that wacko?
i'll let officer white ... of the okeebachokee bureau of animal safety explain .
dr. lvan krank is a dangerous fraud .
his experiments did not turn animals human at all .
they turned them into hideous , weird mutations like this !
aaah !
ohhh !
we have to go to florida !
why?
to keep spot from being turned into that !
ohhh !
this is no time to stand around screaming silently .
come on !
florida? !
florida's outside !
i'm an indoor kitty .
i'm s s scared of the o o outside .
snap out of it , hairball !
come on , dry those whiskers and listen to me !
you gotta believe
you gotta be strong
you gotta sharpen your claws
fluff up your tail , and sing this fighting song
small but mighty , small but mighty
when you're powerful and wise
you can rise above any size
lf you belittle being little
then your quest is doomed to fail
but when you're small but mighty
the mighty shall prevail
you gotta persist i gotta persist?
never say die never say die?
you gotta be fast and fearless now
and follow this battle cry
small but mighty
small but mighty
when you're powerful and wise
you can rise above any size
lf you belittle being little
then your quest is doomed to fail
when you're small but mighty
small but mighty
when you're small but mighty
the mighty shall prevail
onward !
are you sure you got dr. krank's address right?
yeah , 666 .
wait !
look !
wow .
look at all the high techy tech !
ah ha ha !
i can't stand it !
i'm gonna be a boy
ooh !
spo t. v 665?
oh , it must be the next one down that a way .
heh heh heh .
florida land of surprises .
trust me , fellas .
it's a great gig .
24 hour a day soaps , all the food you can eat
where else are you gonna get a deal like that?
oh , spot !
and pretty boy !
and mr. jolly !
come on in , boys .
there's fresh food in the kitchen .
her heart's in the right place ... but , boy , could she use a new set of bifocals .
come on , jolly , let's roll .
are we there yet?
oh !
small but mighty .
say it with me , baby !
spo t. v well .
ie means business .
this can't be it .
this is it !
after this experiment succeeds ... the world will never again call me wacko !
and that includes you ...
mommy !
uhh !
i have done it !
success , at long last !
i have taken a frog , and made it ...
moo .
i have failed again .
see?
he's nuts .
it doesn't work .
come on , let's go .
well , of course it doesn't work on a frog .
hello?
it's a lower life form .
moo .
no offense .
none taken .
dennis !
adele !
get in here now ... and help me destroy this stupid , worthless machine !
don't call it stupid , daddy .
you made us with it .
and where is the glory in that?
and don't call me daddy !
you are not my children .
you're nothing but a couple of mutant swamp creatures ... who do nothing but remind me of my life of failure !
just 'cause you're having a bad day ... is it really necessary to dump on everyone else?
yes , we may be failures , but we're failures who love you .
out of my way , you walking handbag !
spo t. v um .
iello?
who is that?
heh .
jeez , he looked a lot shorter on tv .
maybe it's the ax .
allow me to introduce myself .
i am scott leadready ll , your newest subject .
the one that's finally going to work !
dare you torment an old man?
you cannot help me !
aah !
you're nothing but a worthless boy !
you're wrong , dr. krank .
i am a dog who wants to be a worthless boy .
i mean , who wants to be a boy .
good lord , i was totally fooled .
don't worry .
happens all the time .
now , here's your problem as i see it , doc .
while your theories are scientifically sound ... and your equipment technically flawless ... you keep hitting a failure point ... when it comes to the selection of your subjects .
see , you've been experimenting on swamp creatures ... insects , and , uh , reptiles .
and all ee gators !
all ee gators are reptiles .
proceed .
mm hmm .
but the fact is , dr. krank ... if you want to make a man ... you've got to start with a mammal !
yes .
of course .
it's so simple , and yet so utterly brilliant !
ha ha ha !
i wish i had a nickel for every time i've heard that .
i shall give you a nickel ... if you will be my mammal .
i'll take it !
then i shall make you a boy .
oh , boy !
oh , no !
spot , this is wrong .
tlis is going against natunre .
nature?
feh !
i am a man of science !
you're a wacko of science !
who do you think you are?
i'll tell you who i am .
or , better yet , i'll sing it !
maestro , a tango , if you please .
i was born with a brain
that could not be contained
so they tortured and teased me
and called me insane
it was bad , very bad
even mom called me mad
any child would go wild from the pain
raised on rage and defiance
i turned my cerebrum to science
i tinkered and toiled until my beakers all boiled
and i built this amazing appliance
now the whole world will see
the genius in me
while i stand on the shoulders of giants
ha ha ha !
i am i , lvan krank
just a man way ahead of his time
allow me to be frank
i'm much hipper than old dr. frankenstein
i am i , lvan krank
and you may call me wacko or weird
but you'll have me to thank
when this pup that you've reared
ls no longer wet nosed , waggy tailed , or dog eared
he'll be human , like you , man
the world will all cheer
for the genius that is i
lvan krank
let the neuro exchange animal transformation operation or n. e. a. t. o. for short not to be confused with that stupid teacher award begin !
no o o o o !
leonard . v spot . tlis is wnrong !
leonard . v you" nre supposed to be my dog .
then i shall make you a boy .
oh , it's alive .
it's alive !
that's a good start !
dennis !
adele !
remove the bandages , and let us witness ... what i hath wrought !
mein gott in himmel .
whoa .
daddy did it !
spo t. v i gotta see !
i" m a boy !
i" m a boy !
i'm a really big boy .
you're not a boy , scott .
you're a man .
i'm a man?
i don't understand .
how could i be a man?
great balls of kibble !
i forgot all about dog time !
that's right !
one human year equals seven dog years .
that would make you ...
don't do the math .
uh , it's not exactly what i had planned , but i'm human ... and that's nothing to shake your tail at .
how can i thank you?
oh , it will be thanks enough ... that you spend the rest of your life ... traveling around the world with me ... as living proof of my genius !
ah .
well , uh , gee , fun as that sounds for me ...
i'm afraid i'm gonna have to pass .
i can't spend the rest of my life with you .
l l i live with this guy ... at his house , in his room .
i sleep on the bottom bunk .
heh .
although , now that i'm a big , grown man ... with knuckle hair and uhh lower back pain ... that may present a slight problem .
but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it .
let's go , leonard !
no !
aah !
you're not going anywhere , my precious man .
i made you , i own you .
you're mine !
come , dennis , adele !
we must begin making plans ... for the lvan krank world vindication tour !
first the united nations , then my high school reunion .
no , wait !
nuts !
over here !
get down !
hi , uncle lvan !
the bus from east westland was a little late , but here i am !
lan?
leonard?
what are you doing in my uncle's laboratory?
and who are you , mister ... and why are you all dressed up like scott leadready ll?
uh , no time to explain , strange little boy ...
i've never met before in my life .

though money may be
the root of all evil
money , it might not buy you love
money won't bring you happiness
or grow new hair or cure your stress
or get you to the pearly gates above
but there's a bunch of things that money can do
put a shirt on your back and a shine on your shoe
when the cash shows up , i don't say " boo
i take the money and run
'cause love can't buy a fancy car
or fill your tank
lf you want the finer things
you better break the bank
'cause if there's one sure thing that money can do
put the pedal to the metal when the rent comes due
when the money shows up , baby , don't say " boo
just take the money and run , oh , yeah
take the money and run
go , man , get your stash , grab your cash
take the money and run
mom , dad , i am a prisoner in this chamber of horrors !

coffee?
i've always wanted to try coffee .

what a beverage !
who'd believe that little brown bean from brazil ... could pack such mellow , rich roasting ... good to the last drop flavor?
by the way ... were you aware that it was our 26th president
theodore " teddy " roosevelt who originally coined the phrase " good to the last drop "?
little known fact , but true .
yes , i think one of my students mentioned that once .
i can't remember which one .

time for you to go now .

you are gonna be so proud of me !
we can stop worrying how i'm gonna live ... and where i'm gonna sleep ... and how we're gonna stay together .
i've stumbled upon the answer , and it doesn't even matter ... that i'm a hairy knuckled grownup with back pain .
ooch !
ln fact , it works to our advantage !
you're kidding !
of course , i won't be sleeping at the bottom bunk anymore ... but i promise i'll tuck you in and tell you a bedtime story ... before i settle in to watch the 9 : 00 news with ...
mary lou .

your mom .

i can see myself !
i know who mary lou is ... but why would you be watching the news with her?
and why is she dancing around with your dinner plate?

ol . it is tlat stupid ...
beautiful song !
oh , leonard .
i know it's been said
everyone needs someone
a loyal companion
to share in life's fun
for a day at the park
or a game of leapfrog
a friend needs a friend
a boy needs a dog
a small hand to shake
wanna run a race?
for a bowl full of grub
what a funny face
a face to be licked
when a tummy gets rubbed
like a mom and a dad
need their bundle of joy
a friend needs a friend
a dog needs a boy
pretty bo y. sobblng . v a classic !
even a bird and a cockamamie cat can see that !
yeah .
why couldn't spot?

like i love spot ... you gotta let him have his dream , right?
even if it's different from your dream , right?
yeah .
