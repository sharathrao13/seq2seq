hey , see that gutter drain over there?

we're out of the marlboros and the winstons are looking grim .

my heart starts clocking a buck fifty because there's no one around .
oh , god .

he's nice .

he doesn't want him to feel alone .

straight up .
here's sal .
about fucking time .
hey , there , bad boy .
sarge .
this should be the city's , but the park's state jurisdiction .
so if the body's in there , the case is ours .
how much evidence do you think they've destroyed?
let's go find out .
parker hill vic walks into the er on his own , steak knife sticking out of his collarbone .
he asks the nurse , " hey , where they keep the coke machine?
did she tell him?
tom , what do we got on the car so far?
we found the registration in the glove box .
owner is katherine markum .
oh , shit .
you know her?
maybe .
might be the daughter of a guy i know .
we found a wallet and a license in a backpack .
she's 19 .
oh , fuck , that's her .
is it a problem?
you close with the guy?
when we were kids .
now it's just a " hello " around the neighborhood .
nineteen .
fuck , man .
he's in for a world of hurt .
do not make her laugh .
door was ajar when we found it , headlights on .
blood on the driver's door , speaker , more blood on top of the steering wheel ... ... around this bullet hole .
punched through the driver's seatback , shoulder level .
okay , perp stood outside the car ... ... girl slams him with the door , perp gets a round off ... ... hits her in the shoulder , maybe the bicep .
she runs for it through the trampled weeds ... what do you think?
yeah , i dig that .
body of christ .
body of christ .
amen .
my god , jimmy , our baby .
body of christ .
body of christ .

all we know now is there are signs of foul play ... ... in a car found abandoned outside of pen park .
now , police officers have moved in quickly and cordoned off the area ... ... but even as we speak , a crowd of spectators has gathered .
we don't know more than that , but we will stay on the story .

no one's said anything , right?
what do you mean?
you haven't seen her yet , right?
it might not be her , right?
jimmy?
jimmy , please ...
please what?
please ...
please what , baby?
please what?
that's her .
that's katie .
that's my daughter .
fresh brewed .
so we need to work a time line .
it's details , little things that make a case .
you know , things that you could forget about after a day or two .
did you ever think about how one little choice could change a whole life?
i heard hitler's mother wanted to abort him .
at the last minute , she changed her mind .
see what i mean?
what do you mean , jimmy?
what if you or i had gotten into that car instead of dave boyle?
what car?
you're losing me here .
if i'd gotten into that car that day , my life would have been a different thing .
my first wife , marita , katie's mother ... ... she was a beautiful woman .
regal .
as a lot of latin women are , and she knew it .
you had to have balls to go near her , and i did .
eighteen years old , the two of us .
she was carrying katie .
now , here's the thing , sean .
if i'd gotten into that car , i'd be a basket case .
i never would have had the juice to go near her .
and katie never would have been born .
and she never would have been murdered .
you know?
you ever see dave around?
he married my cousin celeste .
what time did katie get home from work yesterday?
around 7 : 30 .
anything unusual , out of the way about her?
no .
she sat with us , with me and the girls , while we ate .
she was having dinner with her friends .
eve pigeon and diane cestra?
yeah .
she talked to nadine about her communion ... ... and then she was on the phone in her room for a bit .
and then around 8 , she left .
do you know who she talked to?
no .
do you mind if we have the phone company subpoenaed for records?
no , go ahead .
good .
you say you spent most of the day saturday with your daughter in the store , correct?
yes and no .
i was mostly in back .
anything odd?
a confrontation with a customer , anything?
no , she was herself , she was happy .
she ...
she what?
it's nothing .
listen , the littlest thing could be something right now .
it's just that when she was little , right after her mother died ... ... i had just gotten out of prison , she couldn't be by herself .
whether she was crying or not , it didn't matter ... ... but she gave a look sometimes , like she was preparing to never see you again .
for a couple of seconds on saturday , she looked at me that way .
okay .
it was just a look .
it's information .
we collect it , put it together , see what fits .
little things .
you were in prison?
oh , jesus .
here we go .
whitey .
i'm just asking .
sixteen years ago , i did a two year bit for robbery at deer island .
is that gonna find my daughter's killer?
just asking .
let's forget about that .
let's get back to the point .
sorry .
it's all right .
it's all right .
okay , mr. markum .
okay .
okay .
all right .
so , jimmy ... ... outside of the look katie gave you , was there anything else?
there was this kid .
what am i talking about?
that was this morning .
what?
remember , it's the little things .
this kid brendan harris come in the store , like he was expecting to see her .
barely knew each other .
could they have been dating?
no .
what makes you so sure?
sean , are you gonna grill me?
a father knows .
mrs. markum , was katie seeing anyone?
no one right now , as far as we know .
i mean , knew .
i'll give you whatever you need tomorrow .
we got girls at home wanting to know where their sister is .
all right , there will be a trooper downstairs to take you home .
and if you think of anything ... ... anything at all , give us a call .
he said you almost got into a car when you were kids?
shit .
me , jimmy and a kid named boyle were playing in front of my house .
this car came up and took dave away .
abduction?
yeah , guys pretending to be cops .
convinced dave to get in the car , kept him for four days before he escaped .
they catch these guys?
one died .
the other got busted , went the noose route in his cell .
your pal markum , the moment i laid eyes on him , i could tell he'd done time .
they never lose that tension , it settles in their shoulders .
he lost his daughter .
that's what's in his shoulders .
no , that's in his stomach .
the tension in his shoulders , that's prison .
the gunshot wound to the head , not the trauma from the beating .
what else?
her and her friends were barhopping .
we're interviewing anyone who might have seen them .
one other thing , the backpack in her car ... ... had pamphlets on las vegas and a list of vegas hotels .
it doesn't sound like much .
what do you say , devine?
we'll get the guy , sir .
that's right .
all right , let's do it .
that's the best you can come up with?
it made him happy , didn't it?
this is sean .
hello?
is it lauren?
you're in manhattan .
i can tell by the traffic sounds .
is he with you?
is that the baby?
lauren , at least tell me her name .
yeah , nice talking to you too .
hey .
would it surprise you?
wouldn't be the first time .
did you see that girl?
did you see that ...?
did you see her?
i heard a car hit something .
hit what?
another car?
oh , no , not loud like that .
like hitting the curb?
yes , maybe .
then it stalled , and someone said , " hi .
someone said , " hi "?
" hi .
then there was a loud crack .
could it have been a gunshot?
yes , maybe .
did you look out your window , mrs. prior?
oh , no .
i was in my dressing gown by then .
i don't look out the window in my dressing gown .
the voice you heard , was that a male or a female?
female .
i think .
it sounds like the girl knew the shooter .
yeah .
sorry to trouble you .
jimmy .
theo .
how's my daughter?
how's annabeth holding up?
she's trying .
let's get these on ice .
you got a couple of coolers?
right here's fine .
so how are you handling all this so far?
it hasn't really sunk in , theo .
yeah?
it's gonna hurt like hell when it does .
when my janey died , i was no good for six months ... ... but my kids were all grown up .
i had that luxury .
you , you got domestic responsibilities .
domestic responsibilities?
yeah , you gotta take care of my daughter and those girls .
that's your first priority .
oh , you figured that might have slipped my mind?
it just needed to be said , that's all .
you'll come through because you're a man .
like i said to annabeth , your wedding day .
i said , " you got yourself a real old school man there .
like they put her in a bag .
what?
that's what katie looked like when i saw her in the morgue .
like they put her in a bag and then they beat the bag with pipes .
well ...
janey died in her sleep , all due respect .
she went to sleep , she never woke up .
peaceful .
you don't need to talk about janey .
my daughter was murdered .
they put a gun to her .
as we stand here , she's on an autopsy slab ... ... getting cut open by scalpels and chest spreaders ... ... and you're talking to me about domestic fucking responsibility?
good to see you , theo .
eve , just tell them what they want to know .
who was she dating?
we already told the savages .
the savage brothers?
they were here yesterday .
good , now try us out .
who was she dating?
no one special .
you guys were having a goodbye dinner , right?
what?
she was leaving town , wasn't she?
going to las vegas?
how do you know?
she closed her bank account , she had hotel phone numbers .
she wanted out of this dump .
she wanted to start a new life .
well , a 19 year old girl doesn't go to las vegas alone .
so who was she going with?
come on , girls .
who was she going with?
brendan .
excuse me?
brendan .
brendan harris?
brendan harris , yeah .
you got an address?
hey , dave .
hey , jimmy .
sorry , i came out for a smoke .
go ahead , sit down .
sit down .
i haven't had a chance to talk to you all day .
how you doing?
how you doing?
what happened to your hand?
this?
i was helping a buddy move a couch .
i slammed it in the doorjamb .
ways you can manage to hurt yourself , right?
it's good to see you .
yeah?
how are our girls holding up?
they're doing okay , i guess .
that celeste , she's a godsend .
you thank her for me , will you?
it's nice , isn't it?
just to sit out here .
yeah .
i couldn't stand looking through the fridge to find room for all that food ... ... we're gonna throw away in the next few days .
lot of waste , huh?
yeah .
i just can't let anything get fucked up in these next few days .
because it's all anybody will remember about her .
one thing you could say about katie , even when she was little ... ... that girl was neat .
when i got out of the joint ... ... you know , after marita died ... ... i remember , i was more afraid of my little daughter ... ... than i ever was of being in prison .
i loved her ... ... most ... ... because when we were sitting in that kitchen that night ... ... it was like we were the last two people on earth .
you know , forgotten .
unwanted .
and it's really starting to piss me off , dave , because i can't cry for her .
my own little daughter , and i can't even cry for her .
jimmy .
you're crying now .
yeah , damn .
i just want to hug her one more time .
she was 19 fucking years old .
do you want me to leave you alone?
no , just stay here for a minute , if that's cool .
yeah , sure .
jimmy , it's cool .
when was the last time you saw katie markum?
you don't think i'd hurt her do you?
she isn't hurt .
she's dead .
i didn't kill her .
again , when's the last time you saw her?
about 8 ...
saturday night , about 8 : 00 .
about like 8 , brendan , or at 8?
it was about 8 .
we had a couple slices at hi fi , and she had to go meet eve and diane .
yeah .
why doesn't jimmy markum like you?
i don't know .
but he told katie he never wanted her to see me or any other harris .
what?
that thief thinks he's better than our family?
he's not a thief .
he's a thief !
a scumbag burglar .
daughter probably had the same bad gene .
you count yourself lucky , bren .
so katie had some brochures for vegas .
we heard she was going there with you .
we were gonna leave sunday .
we were gonna get married when we got there .
well , that was the plan , right?
you were gonna leave me?
without a word?
ma , i was gonna tell you .
just like your father , huh?
that's my brother , ray , and his friend john .
hey , boys .
hey .
he don't speak .
father couldn't shut up , but his son's a mute .
oh , yeah , life's fucking fair .
they're here about katie .
why don't you go watch tv or something .
so where were you between 12 : 30 and 2 a . m .
on sunday morning , brendan?
i was asleep .
can you confirm that , mrs. harris?
i can confirm that he closed his door at 10 : 00 .
he came down for breakfast at 9 .
i can't confirm that he didn't open his window and go down the fire escape .
okay , we're gonna ask you to take a polygraph .
you think you'd be up for that?
i loved her so much .
i'm never gonna feel that again .
it doesn't happen twice .
doesn't happen once most times .
celeste .
sorry , jimmy .
you surprised me .
what are you still doing here?
i don't know .
i don't know , i just ...
did annabeth get to sleep?
yeah , i convinced her to take a pill .
could i get one of those?
yeah .
one for the road and then home .
jimmy , i can stay over if you want .
sit up with annabeth .
you've done enough .
to you and dave for being here for this .
okay , jimmy .
i'll be back .
i'll be by first thing tomorrow .
see you first thing .
good night .
good night .
yeah , good night .
hello?
christ .
lauren , say something .
okay .
hey , sean , how was your day?
oh , me?
i'm tired of wishing things made sense .
i'm tired of caring about some dead girl , and there's just gonna be another one after her .
sending killers to jail is sending them where they've been heading all their lives .
the dead are still dead .
jesus , i ... ... can't do this tonight .
i just ...
i can't do it .
bye , baby .
because ... ... sometimes the man wasn't a man at all .
he was the boy .
the boy who escaped from wolves .
an animal of the dusk .
invisible .
silent .
living in a world ... ... the others never saw .
world of fireflies .
unseen except as a flare in the corner of your eye .
vanished by the time you turn your head toward it .
i just gotta get my head right .
catch a nice , long sleep .
and the boy will go back to his forest .
back to his fireflies .
is he asleep?
how's jimmy and everybody?
okay .
it's weird .
took something like this for me and him to become friends again .
dave?
dave .
there's still nothing in the paper .
about what?
about what?
i don't know , honey .
maybe i didn't hurt him as bad as i thought .
he's a mugger .
he's not going to the hospital .
yeah .
right .
anyhow , it doesn't matter , does it?
i mean , katie markum is dead .
that seems more important right now .
i know in my soul i contributed to your death .
but i don't know how .
brendan harris aced his polygraph .
good .
i didn't like him for it , nor want him for it .
yeah .
poor fucking kid .
ballistics will be back in a while .
meantime , we got a list of bar patrons .
all people who , i'm certain , are dying to cooperate .
considering the crime , maybe .
dave boyle?
hey , is that the guy you were friends with as a kid?
the car guy?
could be .
he's a guy to talk to .
he knows you .
he won't treat us like cops .
clam up for no reason , huh?
we'll see .
hey , boyle !
what's it been , seven , eight years?
yeah .
yeah .
how you doing?
this is my son , michael .
hey , michael .
how you doing?
my name's sean .
i'm an old buddy of your dad's .
hi .
so you still with the staties?
homicide .
this is my partner .
sergeant powers .
how are you?
so you got a minute?
we'd love to ask some quick questions .
i was just gonna walk michael to school .
i can be back in a few minutes .
tell you what , we'll walk with you , okay?
sure .
so you look good .
i hear rents are rising .
yeah , the yuppies are coming .
they're cutting my dad's old house up into condos .
we walked by there the other day .
must be something we could do to stop them .
neighborhood needs a fucking crime wave .
get property values where they belong .
young girls keep getting murdered up in pen park , mr. boyle , you might get your wish .
dave .
call me dave .
you said the f word , dad .
yeah , i know .
walk on up ahead , michael .
us guys need to talk .
go on .
so , what's up , sean?
yeah , you heard about katie markum?
yeah , i was at jimmy's yesterday .
celeste is there now .
who's celeste?
my wife .
how's jimmy doing?
it's hard to tell .
you know him .
yeah , so the reason we came by ...
listen , i saw her .
katie .
i don't know if you know that .
at mcgill's , the night she died .
that's what we wanted to talk about .
they were at a couple of bars that night .
your name turned up for mcgill's .
they put on quite a show dancing on the bar .
pretty drunk , huh?
but it was harmless .
they weren't stripping or nothing .
they were just 19 .
what time did they leave?
i left at 1 .
they must've left 15 minutes before me .
so we'll say 12 : 45?
sounds about right .
you see anything unusual or anyone ...?
michael .
like what?
i don't know .
a guy watching the girls?
a guy with hate in his eyes?
a woman hater?
no .
no , if they hadn't danced on the bar , it would've been business as usual .
see you later , dad .
you got your milk money?
fuck , i hated school .
what?
yeah , me too , sean .
just one more thing , mr. boyle .
where did you go after you left mcgill's?
home .
home by 1 : 15 , would you say?
roughly .
sure .
all right .
yeah , well , thanks a lot , dave .
we'll grab a beer sometime?
yeah , i'd like that , sean .
all right .
what?
what happened to him in that car?
