eddie and i have known each other a long time .
we are best friends .

you have to close your eyes .
sit like this .
arms like this .
both of you .
draw a deep breath .
i knew it .
that's what makes it so horrible .
you know something terrible is going to happen .
and then it does .

he's lived a good life with our money .
when i get out , i'm going to visit him .
i have nothing , eddie .
eddie , i need you to come with me .
i can't do it on my own .
you know the rules , kullmann .
you'll get over it .
it just takes time .
that's just the way it is .
you'll get over it .
it's been five years .
you need more time .
you can't ask me now .
i just thought ...
you can't ask me now !
reel it in .
i said reel it in .
i caught one !
a real fighter .
reel it in slowly .
slowly !
take the hook out and release it .
it's too small .
what's with your roof , eddie?
it needs fixing .
i know a guy who sells roofing tile .
it's going to rain into your bedroom .
you have to get that fixed .
i'm holding you .
don't be afraid .
ok , come on .
i'm holding you .
come on .
come on .
don't forget to breathe .
keep your head above water !
you're swimming !
breathe out .
you're swimming !
how is your back?
stiff .
my dad had the same back problem , but he never made it out of bed .
you get used to it .
how is maria doing?
fine .
this is prime topsoil .
poor things like this need all the help they can get .
guess i'll head home now ...
what's this?
roofing tile .
where did you get it?
we ...
we talked about this earlier .
i didn't ask you to get tiles .
no , but we did talk about it .
where did you get this?
i told you .
my friend sells it .
are you accusing me of ...
do you think ...
do you think i have stolen it?
no , that's not it .
i just don't know where you got it .
that's all i'm saying .
do you think i stole it?
have i said that?
have i used those words?
then what are you saying?
i don't know where you got this .
so you think i stole it .
that's not what i'm saying !
what are you saying?
that i don't know !
you are wearing my shoes and jacket .
the shoes were in the hall ...
don't you have your own clothes?
i was wet .
i know .
these shoes were in the hall !
shit !
i got you some roofing tile .
you have a leak over the kitchen .
aren't you leaving soon?
what?
aren't you leaving?
i won't bother you anymore .
eddie?
eddie !
hello?
it's just a little scratch .
maria?
can you help me into the house?
let's see .
you have to help .
one , two , three !
thank you .
can you walk?
sure .
let's go inside .
maria , do you have a needle and thread?
i cut my self a little , trimming that spruce .
she's too good for you .
you'll have to help me , eddie .
how long is he staying?
i don't know .
he can't leave now .
he did it on purpose .
cut his leg?
he knew what he was doing .
no .
i was watching him .
i knew he would cut himself .
you're saying he did it on purpose?
it looked like it .
that's not the same as actually doing it .
he'll leave when he is ready .
it's my dog .
you have a dog?
i have a dog .
tito .
what's he doing in your trunk?
he's dead .
aren't you planning on burying him?
sure , but i didn't want to trouble you with that my first night .
i should have told you .
i'm sorry .
where did you get him?
i didn't know you had a dog .
you know nothing about me .
i know there's a dog in your trunk !
i was going to bury him .
now .
today .
how did he die?
i backed up over him .
you ran over him?
i backed up over him .
he never used to sit behind the car .
it was a tragedy .
you can say that again .
i'll go bury him now .
you can visit the grave tomorrow .
i've seen you somewhere before .
i don't think so .
have a seat .
what do you want?
i've seen you before .
haven't i?
i wouldn't know .
you were ... out of it .
you didn't seem to care .
i am also out of it .
maria?
are you eddie's buddy?
don't want to talk?
can't you talk?
eddie ...
i am also eddie's buddy .
lnto the jungle .
i have used one of these many times .
mostly eddie , though ...
that's what happens when people owe money .
you have to ...
you have to use it sometimes .
even if you don't want to .
understand?
they didn't understand either .
until afterward .
then they understood very well .
very well .
you be careful with this .
can a barn just self ignite?
i've been looking for bamse .
bamse?
my dog .
he didn't come home .
he usually comes home at night to sleep under his favorite chair .
you haven't seen him , have you?
no , i didn't think so .
let me know if you do .
bamse !
dammit !
what color is your dog?
brown .
stand up !
what color is he?
brown .
brown? ls your dog brown?
ls he really brown?
what's with you?
yes , he's brown .
did you burn down the barn , too?
i don't know what to say , sven .
this is horrible .
he told me everything .
what?
what's done is done .
maybe we should leave .
bye , sven .
what did you tell sven?
i told him we did it .
what?
i said we ran over his dog .
i told him you backed up over his dog .
why did you tell him that?
it was spur of the moment .
i couldn't get my self to say that i did it , because he was so ...
he was sad .
so you told him that i killed his dog?
it was hard for me to admit it , so i said it was you .
he's my neighbor .
he does everything for me .
for me , kullmann !
here , where i live .
let's go back .
we'll go back and tell him the truth .
kullmann had something else to tell you .
it wasn't ...
eddie didn't run over your dog .
i did .
i came around the corner , and there he was .
he's a big dog , sven .
he jumped up on the car and started barking .
he was a good dog .
i think you should leave now .
i mean , what happened ...
you did hard time .
but you know the rules .
you took your punishment .
took it for both of us .
say no more , eddie .
i can't play your game anymore .
i can't .
i am going to leave , and y ou'll never have to see me again .
eddie?
i am telling you that i will leave ,
as soon as you help me with this one tiny favor .
then i will leave .

i'm going back to bed .
does it hurt here?
yes .

maybe that mutton .
no , i ate lots of that mutton .
i don't want him here while i'm sick .
then who's going to fix the roof?
what's the matter?
what is it , eddie?
i think it's something i ate .
should we call a doctor?
no .

for maria's sake , too , and the baby?
this could be serious .
lf you have a virus , you should stay away from maria .
