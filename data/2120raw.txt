get the corpse from the well .
yes , sir .
mr yamamura .
don't .
i haven't seen her since she was a child .
the well was on dr ikuma's estate .
it was sealed when they sold the place 30 years ago ... ... and it was never opened after that .
but that is sadako .
there's no record of a " sadako " , not in dr ikuma's or the mother's family .
what happened to dr ikuma?
he died right after the place was sold .
i'm the only one left alive .
burn her !
dispose of the ashes wherever you want .
i'm afraid that's not possible .
it's a very strange case .
one of the people who found her is dead , and the other's vanished .
and there's one more thing ...
the time of death .
according to the autopsy she died only a year or two ago .
what?
that means that she was alive down there the entire time ...
for 30 years .
everyone's talking about this " video curse " .
what happens in it?
i've heard that it's a creepy woman  who tells you that you will die in one week's time .
they say she appears if you watch tv late at night .
then the phone rings .
tv?
what channel?
some localstation in izu .
izu?
do you really want to use this?
why not?
you die if you don't show it to someone within a week ...
we'll have to get someone to say that on camera .
still no word from reiko?
no .
the police called about her .
is asakawa reiko here?
no , not at the moment .
everyone's talking about this " video curse " .
what happens in it?
i've heard that it's a creepy woman  who tells you that you will die in one week's time .
excuse me !
do you know what this is all about?
we haven't heard from her .
a man named takayama ryuji died .
takayama?
ms asakawa's ex husband .
the police have been here , too .
she's been gone for days .
have they been inside?
no .
they never asked .
go ahead .
ms takano ...
what's that?
a videotape?
forgive me , father !
i had to save yoichi .
are you okay?
she asked me about a video when i saw her ...
she's a single mother , so they don't assign her important stories .
that's right !
her boy !
he was in school ...
ms asakawa?
she's not here right now .
this is the police .
ms asakawa's father was found dead this morning .
where's mr kadokura?
over there .
sir?
yes?
omuta , shizuoka police .
thanks for coming .
have you found the daughter?
no .
the woman in the well?
we're reconstructing the face .
we're going to make a model and ask around the area .
he found the body .
hang on ...
do you want to see him?
people don't usually die like that .
are you recording something?
yes .
we're wondering if it has anything to do with this note .
reiko , i got rid of the tape .
there's nothing to worry about now .
he's been absent more than ten days .
what's the matter?
nothing .
why are you looking for reiko?
i want to find out why professor takayama died .
i'll check around .
i'll call you if i find anything .
bye .
yes?
it's the police .
i know it's late , but i'd like to ask about takayama ryuji .
ms takano mai?
first on the scene?
yes .
can i come in?
please .
that's right ...
professor takayama taught math , didn't he?
and you are ...?
his assistant .
have you ever heard of yamamura sadako?
no .
her mother shizuko?
no .
ikuma heihachiro?
no .
takayama ryuji and asakawa reiko were looking for something , right?
i'm afraid i don't know .
i see .
asakawa reiko's father was found dead today .
in a similar state to professor takayama .
do you know what i mean?
go away , please .
they'd found a corpse in a well .
a woman who died a year or two ago .
but that well was sealed 30 years ago .
it's hard to imagine , right?
almost 30 years down there in the dark ...
neither of the hands had nails .
they were found in the sides of the well , where she had tried ...
go away !
all right .
call me if you hear where asakawa reiko is .
i'm sorry .
it's just such a strange case .
what's the " video " all about?
i don't know .
nope ...
do you live around here , professor?
yes .
i can concentrate better here than in my apartment .
we're rolling .
pick up where we left off .
three seconds ...
you have to copy it and show it to someone within a week .
if you don't , exactly one week later ...
so there was an original video that people copied?
where did it come from?
it was just there .
everyone has tapes that they don't know what's on .
one had this weird stuff on it .
how can you tell that it's that tape?
you'll know .
does anyone have this tape?
i know people .
they're scared , so they're all showing it to each other .
have you seen it?
can you get me a copy?
okay .
look ...
excuse me .
work out a price .
she was probably after these four .
they all died exactly one week after they watched the tape .
it's hard to believe , right?
this is tomoko .
she was ms asakawa's niece .
there was a friend with her ...
kurahashi ...
kurahashi masami .
what happened to her?
she can't speak .
she's in the hospital at the university .
the doctor can't talk about a specific patient .
you can only ask about his research .
all right .
this way , please .
ms kurahashi?
how are you feeling?
would you like to sit outside for a while?
the doctor said the air would do you good .
are you still afraid of the tv?
i'll bring a partition so you won't have to see it .
okay?
they're here , doctor .
myname's kawajiri .
have a seat .
we put photos of our patients in their files .
do you know why?
in case they run off .
that's right .
illness can change people to the point where their families don't know them .
so we always take pictures .
but when we photographed this patient ... ... using an ordinary camera ... ... we came across something strange .
it's called " spiritphotography " .
something in a person's mind affects the light .
there have been many cases .
is that what's happened here?
we tried just having her hold the film ...
do you see the character?
sada
you probably think i'm crazy .
the entire university does .
did you know takayama ryuji?
yes .
he was the only one who would listen to me .
he studied medicine before he switched to math .
do you know he's dead?
it was a real shame .
then why didn't you attend his funeral?
you can't see it , right?
there's no need to rush .
just take it nice and easy .
what's wrong?
are you feeling ill?
ms kurahashi ...
get her out of here .
tomoko?
tomoko?
help me ...
help me ...
restrain her !
help me !
they said that was the first time she has spoken .
are you going to proceed with ms asakawa's story?
yes .
i wouldn't do that .
why not?
i just wouldn't .
did the girl tell you anything?
wait !
i'm sorry .
don't tell anyone .
the power you have now won't save anyone .
yoichi !
are you yoichi?
where do you live?
can't you talk?
go in there .
it's not much of a place .
have a seat .
i want to go to school .
i'm hungry .
well?
do you remember masami?
she was with tomoko when she died .
yes .
she passed a tv set at the hospital , and something strange appeared .
what was it?
a well .
you could only see it for a second .
was that it?
yes .
you've seen it too , haven't you?
you'll be all right , if that's all .
but i wouldn't look at it again .
masami can't speak either .
so?
if yoichi goes on like this ...
so what should i do?
lock him away in some hospital?
what's it got to do with you?
i'm sorry .
please leave .
can i come back and see yoichi sometime?
hi .
here .
you got it?
we said 20, 000 , right?
i watched it last night .
mr okazaki , you'll watch it too , won't you?
sure .
there's no point if i don't .
do you promise?
of course .
trust me !
hang on .
the money ...
don't forget .
nice catch .
here it comes .
are you studying that already?
why were you at the station the other day?
was your mom angry?
was there someone there?
the woman with long hair .
let's eat .
go and wash your hands .
i think yoichi won't speak because he blames me .
that's not true .
after we left my dad's place , the tv would come on when yoichi came near .
could you talk to dr kawajiri?
if he's like tomoko's friend masami ...
you've seen asakawa reiko .
i didn't call him .
a reporter asked us about a patient .
he'll be here soon .
we're going to try an experiment .
it might help the boy , too .
come in .
this way .
what are you going to do?
this is tap water .
the paper can absorb ...
... about that much .
just like before .
concentrate on the water .
that's good .
the water has changed .
some kind of energy has gone from her to the water .
we can explain the film the same way .
it's energytransfer .
in time all the energy should be transferred .
we're going to try that now .
have a seat .
are you going to record this?
yes .
just like with the pictures .
but you'll see the well .
a well?
everyone who sees it dies .
you're still alive .
hayashi ... mr okazaki .
this is a blank tape .
can you set it up?
masami !
this is dangerous .
if everyone sees it ...
there's something in my head .
quick !
the tape .
even if we get it on tape , videos don't kill .
fear can kill .
prove that , and the energy will dissipate .
you can leave if you want to .
no .
begin .
just like with the photo film .
relax and look at the camera .
what's that sound?
who's that?
doctor !
ms kurahashi !
what are you doing?
some girl called for you ...
she said that it's been a week .
was it the girl with the tape?
right .
i'll give her a call .
good night .
sawaguchi .
is this kanae?
yes .
it's okazaki .
i've watched the tape .
great !
i was really scared .
don't you trust me?
it was almost time ...
you know that strange woman ... the one in the mirror?
hello?
yes , that's the one .
didn't it look like she changed into a child for a second?
just before you could see the well .
where's the tape now?
i got rid of it .
it's too dangerous .
nobody else should see it .
but you have to show it to someone !
you have to , mr okazaki .
i don't want you to die .
all right .
see you , then .
the woman in the mirror ...
reporter dies witnessing psychic test
the test destroyed the reputation of a certain dr ikuma heihachiro .
the fatal demonstration yamamura shizuko and dr ikuma
shizuko ...
you can't just will someone dead .
dr ikuma spoke about how intention is a living thing ... ... and how energy of thought could take physical form .
30 years in a well ... 30 years of concentrated thought ... ... wanting revenge .
we've all seen it .
did takayama and ms asakawa's father see it before they died?
why the father?
did her boy see it?
him , too?
just like the girl .
this can't go on .
where's ms asakawa?
tell me !
yes?
kanae !
kanae !
come with me .
we just want to ask a few questions .
don't worry .
just a minute ...
get away from here !
run !
can't you hear me?
run !
what's wrong?
mom !
yoichi !
freak !
freak !
murderer !
freak !
yoichi !
yoichi !
yoichi !
dad?
dad !
we didn't save yoichi?
your child isn't yoichi anymore .
yoichi ...
yoichi ...
no !
stop it !
okay .
why won't this erase?
who did the story start with?
it never really starts with anyone .
people get anxious , and rumors start to fly .
professor?
what's wrong?
let's go .
does it look like her?
yes ... just as strange .
we'll take some pictures .
that's good .
sadako !
why did you leave me alive?
i was the one who made you and your mother into a freak show !
do you want me to return you to the sea?
is that it?
do you know the yamamuras in sashikiji?
there are lots of yamamuras around here .
a woman named shizuko lived here .
oh , there ...
the yamamura inn
hello?
this way .
i'm sorry .
did i wake you up?
no .
can you promise me something?
what?
don't do that again , no matter what happens .
it's really scary .
okay?
are you on my side?
of course i am .
okay .
i put sadako in the sea .
it's the only thing i could do .
that's what shizuko did with her .
she went off alone when she went into labor .
she came home with a flat stomach , saying she'd put the baby in the sea .
but the next day she came back , and the child was with her .
what's that sound?
it's the cave where sadako was born .
the river of offering " .
unwanted children were put here , so the tide would take them .
who was sadako's father?
hello?
yes?
is ms takano mai staying here?
no .
well , at least you have vacancies ...
sir !
sadako !
you're dead !
you're dead !
you're safe !
do you remember what you dreamt about last night?
okay .
think of your mother .
that's good .
can i speak to you?
the thing that controls him is anger .
his anger summons her .
he can't control it .
my equipmentis on its way .
i'll try to make sadako disappear .
there are no ghosts , no next world .
despite what takayama said .
will yoichi be strong enough?
what's your suggestion?
what if the police show up?
he can channel the energy .
he's the best medium .
i'll do it .
are you as strong as takayama?
yes .
that doesn't mean you'll be better than the boy .
what if i saw the video?
all right .
all we need now is water .
water?
sea water doesn't permeate as well .
we need fresh water to absorb sadako's bitterness .
guide the energy into the water .
it will dissolve there .
and sadako will disappear ...
all right?
yes .
take your places .
remember that i'm on your side .
begin .
close your eyes .
remember what you saw .
what did you see?
yes !
your father and mother are dead .
you're all alone .
what did you see?
it's that woman's fault your mother died .
she betrayed your mother .
that's right .
it's my fault .
good !
just like that .
dr kawajiri !
what's that?
i can see into the next world .
sadako ...
sadako ...
take me !
please .
take me ... ... and put an end to this !
no !
are you okay?
don't let go .
let me fall .
grab the wall .
i can't hold you .
grab the wall !
ms takano ...
it's all right .
no more !
yoichi !
yoichi?
yoichi !
take him .
professor ...
yoichi , give me your fear .
give it to me !
give it to me !
climb the rope !
don't look back .
help me ...
why are you the only one saved?
are you still scared?
no .
are you?
me?
a little bit .
how's okazaki doing?
he's still in the hospital .
the hospital?
where's the key for this?
isn't it this one?
mr okazaki .
i need to take your picture .
can you look this way?
mr okazaki?
look this way .
there you go .
thanks .
