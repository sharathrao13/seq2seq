it's every time with you, jerry .
it's every fuckin'time .
and ...
i can certainly understand that perspective .
uh , but i've been having some personal problems , uh, with my life .
my girlfriend , she's a great girl , but she has complaints .
i don't have complaints , but she has complaints .
if you want to know the truth
i can't even believe this , but we go to a group .

and she hid them .
she hid them .
oh, th the keys .
she hid them .
she you know , and i couldn't get to the thing on time , and it all got messed up , and i think that maybe maybe somethings aren't meant to happen .

here are your options .
number one , i roll you up to the neck in a carpet , stuff you in the back of a sedan and light you on fire with gasoline .
you with me? choice one .

disgusting self .
oh , god . you are
you're missing the grand design here .
if i don't go , i'm dead .

oh , mygod !
jerry , acknowledge .
i okay .
i will acknowledge that i promised i would go to vegas with you .
but now we're just slightly delayed .
if you want to construe my wanting to stay alive as being selfish , well , then , okay .

he fashioned this gun as a gift to go along with the hopes that the nobleman's son ... would take his only daughter's hand in marriage .

the towns people waited three months to catch the first glimpse of the pistol .
finally the day had come .
no one had ever laid eyes on a more beautiful gun .
it was everything they thought it would be .
someeven thought it was too beautiful to look at .
it was considered to be an honor and good luck ... to be the first hand that fires a new y fashioned gun
especiallyone as beautiful as this ,
made for the hand of a nobleman .
the townsman was in a trance at the gun's flawless craftsmanship .
it backfired , killing him instantly .

i got them from my grandma vega , which is a good thing ,
'cause my granny barzel , she had hands like a circus midget .
howcome you can't live with jerry?
do you know jerry?
jerry has trouble expressing his feelings .
he had a really fucked up childhood .
his mom is nuts .
one of those people who thinks the iron is always on .
don't you love him?
i think that's the problem .
we love each other too much .
but he's just he's so selfish .
and it's like we've been living his life forever .
he'd tell you a different story altogether , but i give and i give , and he just keeps taking .
our counselor totally agrees with me , by the way .
chuckles
i don't put much stock in those weirdo counselor types .
all they do is sit around in bare feet and smoke joints .
maybe that's true , but it doesn't change the fact that jerry's a taker and i'm a giver .
it's obvious .
you know , a lot of people are under the impression that you get to choose who you love .
laughs i'm sorry , are you are you taking his side? you're a man .
of course you are .
you're taking his side .

sowhat'swith this " we've been livin 'his life forever " thing?
a figure of speech .
i didn't mean it literally .
jerry's been working for margolese for five years less a day .
it just feels lifelong .
sounds like jail terms .
it is .
arnold margolese is in jail because jerry put him there .
jerry ratted out arnold margolese?
no . jerry was coming across ventura .
you know , over there by laurel canyon .
yeah .
he wasn't paying attention , ran a red light , smashed into margolese's cadillac .
when the cops came , margolese got busted because he had a person in thetrunk .
that's how margolese got sent to jail?
mm hmm .
live person or dead person?
live person .
huh . what'sthe big deal, then?
he probably wasn't gonna stay that way .
he was taped up in a trunk for a reason, wasn't he?
god , i would think this was right up your alley , swifty .
he saw something .
well, whatever it was this guy saw ... or was going to say to the cops , he got the chance .
and since it was technically jerry's fault , margolese had him work off the jail time .
chuckles you see , my whole relationship has been hijacked ... because he doesn't pay attention when he drives .

look , i'm not gonna kill ya .
but i am gonna have to shoot you .
but why , sir? why?
why? why?
because you stole from me , and you know about the pistol and you're just gonna steal again .
and i can't have you coming back in this situation like a fly in the ointment .
no !
i won't be a fly !
you'll never see me again .
look, you're gettin 'shot , and that's it .
it'll take you time to get to the next town ,
especially if you're limping .
wait, wait .
limping?
can't you just tie me up some more?
i mean, fuck ! you shoot me? tie me !
yeah .
i don't have a rope .
so you shoot me?
it's the american way .
where do you want it?
okay .
no , not the leg ! there's arteries .
i could bleed to death in mere seconds .

look, that's fair where i come from .

it'll hurt , but it'll heal .
what if you take off a fucking toe !
wait, wait, wait .
not the left .
sorry .
on the count of three .
one .
screams
look , i'm agreeing with you .
but there's a few ways to look at it .
now , sex is , no matter what anybodysays , a very important part of any relationship .
the fact that jerry is a considerate lover says a lot .
you lost me .
well , he's a considerate lover .
you just gotta find a way to get him to expand this quality he has during sex ... to other areas of your relationship .
i mean , even ifit only comes out in sex , it's there just the same .
that's a good point .
if a person's a considerate lover , he can't be all selfish , right?
unless of course he's
he's , uh , being a considerate  what wast hat?
what?
that . that moment you had .
what moment?
leroy, you just checked out that guyand had a moment .
that was a ... moment .
i don't know if it was a moment .
whispers are you gay?
as in " happy "?
as in homosexual .
what does my sexual orientation have to do with anything we've been talking about?
nothing .
clears throat nothing .
excep tsomething that you said back there really bugged me , and this would kind of help it make sense .
yeah?
what's that?
i asked if you were gonna rape me , and you said , " not likely .
you said itso matter of fact , like i was repulsive ... and it was ludicrous to think that i was actually at risk of you wanting to have sex with me .
first of all , it's a crime of anger , not attraction .
and second of all, you're not repulsive .
you'r every beautiful .
thank you .
you want me to rape ya? are you gay?
you want me to rape ya?
you're gay .
laughs you're gay .
i knew it !
oh , i so knew it .
i just knew it .
what a relief .
what do you want , a medal?
you want a little trinket saying you identified a homosexual?
no . are you full throttle?
chuckles full throttle?
yeah , i guess i am .
oh .
i'm not i mean
i'm not trying to be a smart ass or anything like that .
i just i just think that this is great .
wow .
this is
this is ... major , okay?
i know the kind of people in your business .
okay?
yeah?
and to me , it seems that , well , being gay isn't really ... conducive to the environment .
oh .
like i should be an interiordecorator .
that's insulting .
i am very good at what i do . do you have a boyfriend?
no , i don't .
unfortunately , i seem to be unable to keep ... relationships together .
seems like everybody's having trouble keeping relationships together .

can you tell me , uh, what happened here?
that's not accurate , i'm afraid .
the gunsmith did craft this pistol fora prospective husband , and he was a nobleman's son, true .
but the mot if was darker , my friend .
it's cursed , this gun .
the key to this tale involves the gunsmith's assistant , a poor , but honorable young man in blinding love ... with the gunsmith's daughter .
for months at a time , the assistant took to the mines , gathering the precious metal ... that would yield the most beautiful gun that ever existed , only to discover that what he hoped would be a wedding gift for him , was for another .
the gunsmith insisted his daughter marry the nobleman's son , forbidding their love .
so , angered in his bitter pain , the assistant cursed the gun , vowing the creation would never prevail .
but the gunsmith was racing against time .
he had promised a pistol of unparalleled craftsmanship , the nobleman's dowry hanging in the balance .
he worked day and night to correct the pistol's problems .
this gun never worked properly .
some say its very creation ended the gunsmith's life .
well , my friend, you're free to go , but without the gun .
this gun doesn't belong to you or to your boss .
now it belongs to me .
man yeah, vegas .
it can be tough that way .
samantha ]
expensive?
man ]
yeah , emotionally .
let's just say that i had a serious relationship problem .
oh . you fit right in here .
what do you do now , frank?
now , i am ... a postman .
get out of here .
that's so rigid .
swear to god .
no , come on .
there's a seedy underbelly to the postal service .
is that the key to it?
and that's the key .
you have no idea how many small , unmarked brownpaper packages i deliver .
what , porno?
yeah , daily .
like what?
videos , blow up dolls , dildos , pocket pussies .
don't leave nothing out .
oh, yeah?
hmm .
but, you know , even with all that dirty excitement at my fingertips ,
i still have to take off once a year .
so i just walk out the front door and i know i'm going to vegas .
i just don't know how .
all i've got is my wallet and an attitude .
i don't know , it keeps me sane .
after all , guns don't kill people .
postal workers do .
muttering in spanish
okay, you're all set , mr. shurker . if you go to the front there , a shuttle will take you to your car .
what kind of car is it exactly?
it's a chrysler , sir , brand new .
you wouldn't happen to have something a little more  raoul !
yeah , man !
yeah .
never fear , teddy's here .
how are you?
whistles
speaking spanish
comeon, jerry .
the mexican thief , the dirtycop?
i mean, the word is out .
it's a big ticket item .
a lot of fucking people are interested in that gun .
no fucking way .
is that what they think?
that i'm selling them out?
i don't know, jerry .
maybe they think you're scared and might do the wrong thing .
ted .
you know , i don't know .
i'm just doing my goddamn portion here .
yeah , and what is that?
to find out what's going on , assess the damage , try to calm you down , help find the pistol , get us home .
i tell you something , i get on that plane , pistol or not , that'll be the last fucking flight i evertake .
oh , come on, jerry .
" come on, jerry? " you know it .
i know what i'm supposed to know .
just doing your fucking part .
i know what i'm supposed to know !
you hear yourself .
you sound like fucking schultz from hogan's heroes .
german accent i know nothing !
goddamn it, jerry !
i'm not crazy about nayman running things any more than you are .
but i got a few years on you , and i'm telling you, the thing to do is keep your nose clean ,
look straight ahead and do what you're told .
oh , god .
that's why i'm 17 months of payments away from boca raton .
'cause i do my fuckin 'portions .
now , i don't care how you look at it .
the first step out of this is to get the pistol back .
i never took a payoff in my life .
jerry , look .
i know where your loyalties lie .
but the kid's dead .
the pistol's gone .
i mean, you can see how it looks , right?
come on, jerry .
you're my guy .
