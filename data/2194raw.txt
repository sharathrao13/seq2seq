boy , oh , boy , as if this neighborhood wasn't crummy enough .
now , look , fellas .
fellas?
look , let's be reasonable .
lf i don't get a little law and order around here ...
i get busted down to a traffic corner ... and your friend don't like traffic corners .

the emeralds claimed it , and we shut 'em out .
the hawks tried to take it away , and we knocked 'em down the cellar .
yeah , but these p. r. s are different .
they multiply .
they keep comin '.
like cockroaches .
they're eatin 'all the food .
they're breathin 'all the air .
help !
i'm drowning in tamale .
you heard what lieutenant schrank said .
we gotta make nice with them puerto ricans , or else .
are we gonna let 'em move in and take it all away from us , or else?
you're damn right no .
what are we gonna do , huh , buddy boys?
i'll tell you what we're gonna do .
we're gonna speed fast .
we're gonna move like lightnin '... and we're gonna clean them sharks up once and for all ... so they ain't never gonna set foot on our turf again .
and we're gonna do it in one all out fight .
a rumble !
now , cool , action boy .
the sharks want a piece of this world too .
they're real down boys .
they might ask for blades , zip guns .
zip guns?
well , gee .
i ain't finalizin 'and sayin 'they will , baby john .
i'm just sayin 'that they might .
and we gotta be prepared .
now , what's your mood , jets?
i say go , go !
i say mix .
i say sock 'em .
tear 'em .
yeah .
but if they say blades or guns?
i say let's forget the whole thing .
what?
what do you say , riff?
i say this turf is small ... but it's all we got , huh?
i want to hold it like we always held it with skin .
but if they say blades , i say blades .
lf they say guns , i say guns .
i say i want the jets to be the number one ... to sail , to hold the sky !
then rev us off !
okay , cats , we rumble .
protocality calls for a war council between us and the sharks ... to set the whole thing up .
i will personally give the bad news to bernardo .
you gotta take a lieutenant with you .
that's me .
that's tony .
who needs tony?
we need tony .
he's got a rep that's bigger than the whole west side .
he don't belong no more .
now , cut it , action .
me and tony started the jets .
so where is he?
how come he takes a lousy , stinkin 'job?
youth board corrupted him .
yeah , temporary sickness .
wait and see .
man , the day we clobbered the emeralds .
he saved my ever lovin 'neck .
sure , he'll do it again too .
he always came through for us , and he always will .
when you're a jet you're a jet all the way
from your first cigarette to your last dying day
when you're a jet let them do what they can
you've got brothers around you're a family man
you're never alone
you're never disconnected
you're home with your own when company's expected
you're well protected
then you are set with a capital " j
which you'll never forget till they cart you away
when you're a jet you stay
a jet
i know tony like i know me .
i guarantee you can count him in .
ln , out .
let's get crackin '.
where you gonna find bernardo?
it ain't safe to go in p. r. territory .
he'll be at the dance at the gym .
but the gym's neutral territory .
a rab , i'm gonna make nice with 'em .
i'm only gonna challenge 'em .
great , daddy o.
so listen .
everybody dress up sweet and sharp .
meet tony and me at the dance at 10 : 00 .
and walk tall .
we always walk tall .
we're jets .
the greatest .
when you're a jet you're the top cat in town
you're the gold medal kid with the heavyweight crown
when you're a jet you're the swingingest thing
little boy , you're a man little man , you're a king
the jets are in gear our cylinders are clickin '
the sharks'll steer clear
'cause every puerto rican's a lousy chicken
here come the jets like a bat out of hell
someone gets in our way someone don't feel so well
here come the jets little world , step aside

who knows?

there's something due any day i will know right away
soon as it shows
it may come cannonballin 'down through the sky , gleam in its eye
bright as a rose

i just met a girl named maria
and suddenly that name
will never be the same to me
i just kissed a girl named maria
and suddenly i found
how wonderful a sound can be
say it loud and there's music playing
say it soft
and it's almost like praying
i'll never stop saying
say it loud and there's music playing
say it soft
and it's almost like praying
i'll never stop saying
the most beautiful sound
i ever heard

they use maria for an excuse to start world war ill .
it is more than that .
more than what?
she was only dancing .
with an american who is really a polack .
says the spic .
you are not so cute .
that tony is .
and he works .
a delivery boy .
and what are you?
an assistant .
and chino makes half of what the polack makes .
the polack is an american .
here comes the whole commercial .

your father's a swede .
but you were born here .
that's all that you need .
you are an american .
but us?
foreigners !

cockroaches .
but it's true .
when i think about how i thought it would be for us here .
we came like children , believing , trusting .
with our hearts open .

you came with your mouth open .
you did , spic , and you'll go back in handcuffs .
i'm going back in a cadillac .
air conditioned .
built in bar .
telephone .
television .
compatible color .
lf you had all that here , why would you want to go back to puerto rico?
even if you didn't have all that here , why would you want to go back?

now she's queer for uncle sam .
oh , no .
that's not true .

this boy don't need a couch he needs a useful career
society's played him a terrible trick
and sociologically he's sick i am sick
we are sick , we are sick we are sick , sick , sick

ln my opinion , this child does not need to have his head shrunk at all .
juvenile delinquency is purely a social disease .

take him to a social worker .
which way?
that way .
dear kindly social worker
they tell me get a job
like be a soda jerker which means like be a slob
it's not i'm antisocial i'm only anti work
gloryosky that's why i'm a jerk
officer krupke you've done it again
this boy don't need a job he needs a year in the pen
it ain't just a question of misunderstood
deep down inside him he's no good i'm no good
we're no good , we're no good we're no earthly good
like the best of us is no damn good
the trouble is he's lazy the trouble is he drinks
the trouble is he's crazy the trouble is he stinks
the trouble is he's growing the trouble is he's grown
krupke , we got troubles of our own
gee , officer krupke we're down on our knees
'cause no one wants a fella with a social disease
gee , officer krupke what are we to do
gee , officer krupke krup you

i am too
i have a love
and it's all that i need
right or wrong
and he needs me too
i love him
we're one
there's nothing to be done
not a thing i can do
but hold him
hold him forever
be with him now
tomorrow
and all
of my life
when love comes so strong
there is no right or wrong
your love is
your love
