there was me .
that is , alex , and my three droogs .
that is , pete , georgie and dim .
and we sat in the korova milk bar , trying to make up our rassoodocks ... ... what to do with the evening .
the korova milk bar sold milk plus .
milk plus vellocet or synthemesc or drencrom ... ... which is what we were drinking .
this would sharpen you up ... ... and make you ready for a bit of the old ultra violence .
in dublin 's fair city
where the girls are so pretty
i first set my eyes
on sweet molly malone
as she wheeled her wheelbarrow
through streets broad and narrow
crying , " cockles and mussels ....
one thing i could never stand ... ... was to see a filthy , dirty old drunkie ... ... howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers ... ... and going " blerp blerp " in between ... ... as it might be a filthy old orchestra in his stinking guts .
i could never stand to see anyone like that , whatever his age .
but more especially when he was real old , like this one was .
can you spare some cutter , me brothers?
go on !
do me in , you bastard cowards !
i don't want to iive anyway .
not in a stinking world iike this .
and what's so stinking about it?
it's a stinking world because there's no iaw and order anymore !
it stinks because it iets the young get onto the old . . . . . . iike you done !
it's no world for an old man any ionger .
what kind of a world is it at ail?
men on the moon .
men spinning around the earth .
and there's not no attention paid . . . . . . to earthly iaw and order no more .
oh , dear land
i fought for thee
it was at the derelict casino that we came across billy boy ... ... and his four droogs .
they were about to perform a little of the old ... ... in out , in out on a weepy young devotchka they had there .
weil , if it isn't fat , stinking . . . . . . biily goat biily boy in poison .
how are thou . . . . . . thou globby bottle of cheap , stinking chip oil?
come and get one in the yarbles . . . . . . if you have any yarbles . . . . . . you eunuch jeily , thou .
let's get them , boys !
the police !
come on .
let's go !
the durango 95 purred away real horrorshow .
a nice , warm vibratey feeling all through your guttiwuts .
soon it was trees and dark , my brothers ... ... with real country dark .
we fillied around with other travelers of the night ... ... playing hogs of the road .
then we headed west .
what we were after now was the old surprise visit .
that was a real kick ... ... and good for laughs and lashing of the old ultra violent .
who on earth could that be?
i'ii go and see .
yes , who is it?
excuse me , can you please help?
there's been a terrible accident !
my friend's bleeding to death !
can i please use your telephone?
we don't have a telephone .
you'ii have to go somewhere else .
but , missus , it's a matter of iife and death !
who is it , dear?
a young man .
he says there's been an accident .
he wants to use the telephone .
i suppose you better iet him in .
wait a minute , wiii you?
i'm sorry , but we don't usuaily iet strangers in
what do you want from me?
pete , check the rest of the house .
dim . . . .
i'm singing in the rain
just singing in the rain
what a glorious feeling
i'm happy again
i'm laughing at clouds
so dark up above
the sun 's in my heart
and i'm ready for love
let the stormy clouds chase
everyone from the place
come on with the rain
i've a smile on my face
i'll walk down the lane
with a happy refrain
and i'm singing
just singing ... ... in the rain
viddy weil , iittle brother .
viddy weil .
we were all feeling a bit shagged and fagged and fashed ... ... it having been an evening of some small energy expenditure .
so we got rid of the auto and stopped at the korova for a nightcap .
heilo , lucy .
had a busy night?
we've been working hard too .
pardon me , luce .
there was some sophistos from the tv studios around the corner ... ... laughing and govoreeting .
the devotchka smeched away , not caring about the wicked world one bit .
then the disk on the stereo twanged off and out .
and in the short silence before the next one came on ... ... she suddenly came with a burst of singing .
and it was like , for a moment , o my brothers ... ... some great bird had flown into the milk bar .
and i felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott ... ... standing endwise .
and the shivers crawling up like slow , malenky lizards ... ... and then down again .
because i knew what she sang .
it was a bit from the glorious ninth , by ludwig van .
what did you do that for?
for being a bastard with no manners .
without a dook of an idea about how to comport yourself public wise .
i don't iike you should do what you done .
and i'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be .
watch that .
do watch that , if to continue to be on iive thou dost wish .
yarbles !
great , bouncy yarblockos to you !
i'ii meet you with chain or nozh or britva anytime .
i'm not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless .
it stands to reason , i won't have it .
a nozh scrap anytime you say .
doobidoob .
a bit tired maybe .
best not to say more .
bedways is rightways now .
so best we go homeways and get a bit of spatchka .
right , right?
where i lived was with my dada and mum ... ... in municipal flat block 1 8 a , linear north .
it had been a wonderful evening .
and what i needed now to give it the perfect ending ... ... was a bit of the old ludwig van .
oh , bliss !
bliss and heaven !
it was gorgeousness and gorgeosity made flesh .
it was like a bird of rarest spun heaven metal .
or like silvery wine flowing in a spaceship ... ... gravity all nonsense now .
as i slooshied ... ... i knew such lovely pictures .
alex .
alex !
what do you want?
it's past eight , alex .
you don't want to be iate for school , son .
bit of a pain in the guiliver , mum .
leave us be , and i'ii try and sleep it off .
and then i'ii be as right as dodgers for this after .
but you've not been to schooi aii week , son .
got to rest , mum .
got to get fit .
otherwise , i'm iiable to miss a iot more school .
i'ii put your breakfast in the oven .
i've got to be off meself now .

he's not feeling too good again this morning , dad .
yes .
yes , i heard .
you know what time he got in?
no , i don't .
i'd taken me sleepers .
i wonder . . . . . . where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings .
like he says . . . . . . it's mostly odd things he does .
helping iike . . . . . . here and there , as it might be .
hi , hi , hi , mr. deltoid .
funny surprise , seeing you here .
alex boy !
awake at iast , yes?
i met your mother on the way to work , yes?
she gave me the key .
she said something about a pain somewhere .
hence , not at school , yes?
a rather intolerable pain in the head , brother sir .
it should be clear by this afterlunch .
or certainly by this evening , yes .
the evening's the great time , isn't it , alex boy?
cup of the old chai , sir?
no time , no time .
sit , sit , sit !
to what do i owe this extreme pleasure , sir?
anything wrong , sir?
wrong?
why should you think of anything being wrong?
have you been doing something you shouldn't?
just a manner of speech .
yes , weil , it's just a manner of speech from your . . . . . . post corrective advisor to you that you watch out , iittle alex .
because next time it's not going to be the corrective school .
next time it'ii be the barley place , and aii my work ruined .
if you've no respect for yourself . . . . . . you at ieast might have some for me , who sweated over you .
a big , black mark , i teii you , for every one we don't reclaim .
a confession of failure for every one of you . . . . . . who ends up in the stripy hole .
i've been doing nothing i shouldn't .
the miilicents have nothing on me , brother .
sir , i mean .
cut out this clever talk about miilicents .
just because the police haven't picked you up . . . . . . doesn't mean that you've not been up to some nastiness .
there was a bit of nastiness iast night .
some very extreme nastiness , yes?
a few of a certain biily boy's friends were ambulanced off iate .
your name was mentioned .
the words got to me by the usuai channels .
certain friends of yours were named also .
nobody can prove anything about anybody , as usual .
i'm warning you , iittle alex . . . . . . being a good friend to you as always . . . . . . the one man in this sore and sick community . . . . . . who wants to save you from yourself !
what gets into you ail?
we've been studying the problem for damn weii near a century .
but we get no farther with our studies .
you got a good home here .
good , ioving parents .
you've got not too bad of a brain .
is it some devii that crawls inside of you?
nobody's got anything on me .
i been out of the miilicents 'rookers for a iong time .
that's just what worries me .
a bit too iong to be safe .
you're about due , by my reckoning .
that's why i'm warning you . . . . . . to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt .
do i make myself clear?
as an unmuddied iake , sir .
as clear as an azure sky of deepest summer .
you can rely on me , sir .
excuse me , brother .
i ordered this two weeks ago .
can you see if it's arrived?
just a minute .
pardon me , iadies .
enjoying that , are you , my darling?
a bit cold and pointless , isn't it , my iovely?
what's happened to yours , my iittle sister?
who you getting , bratty?
goggly gogol?
johnny zhivago?
the heaven 1 7?
what you got back home to play your fuzzy warbles on?
i bet you've got iittle pitiful , portable picnic players .
come with uncle and hear aii proper .
hear angei trumpets and devii trombones .
you are invited .
hi , hi , hi , there .
weil , heilo .
he are here !
he have arrived !
hooray !
weily , weily , weily , weily , weily , weily , weil !
to what do i owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit?
we got worried .
there we were , waiting and drinking away at the old knifey moloko . . . . . . and you had not turned up .
and we thought you might have been , iike . . . . . . offended by something or other .
so around we come to your abode .
appy poily ioggies .
i had something of a pain in the guiliver , so i had to sleep .
i was not awakened when i gave orders for wakening .
sorry about the pain .
using the guiliver too much iike , maybe .
giving orders and discipline and such , perhaps .
you sure the pain is gone?
you sure you'd not be happier back in bed?
let's get things nice and sparkling clear .
this sarcasm , if i may caii it such . . . . . . does not become you , my iittle brothers .
as i am your droog and ieader i'm entitled to know what goes on .
now then , dim .
what does that great big horsey gape of a grin portend?
aii right , no more picking on dim , brother .
that's part of the new way .
new way?
what's this about a new way?
there's been some very iarge talk behind my sleeping back , i know it .
if you must have it , have it , then .
we go around shop crasting and the iike . . . . . . coming out with a pitifui rookerfuii of money each .
and wiii the english in the coffee mesto . . . . . . saying he can fence anything any malchick tries to crast .
the shiny stuff .
the ice !
the big , big money's available , is what wiii the english says .
and what wiii you do with the big , big , big money?
have you not everything you need?
if you need a motorcar , you pluck it from the trees .
if you need pretty poily , you take it .
brother , you think and talk sometimes iike a iittle child .
tonight we puii a man size crast .
good !
reai horrorshow !
initiative comes to thems that wait .
i've taught you much , my iittle droogies .
now teii me what you had in mind , georgie boy .
the old moloko plus first .
would you not say?
something to sharpen us up .
some moloko plus .
you got to go there first .
we got a start on you .
moloko plus !
as we walked along the flatblock marina ... ... i was calm on the outside , but thinking all the time .
so now it was to be georgie the general ... ... saying what we should do and what not to do .
and dim as his mindless , grinning bulldog .
but suddenly i viddied that thinking was for the gloopy ones ... ... and that the oomny ones used , like , inspiration and what bog sends .
for now it was lovely music that came to my aid .
there was a window open with a stereo on ... ... and i viddied right at once what to do .
i had not cut into any of dim's main cables .
and so with the help of a clean tashtook ... ... the red , red kroovy soon stopped .
and it did not take long to quieten the two wounded soldiers ... ... down in the snug of the duke of new york .
now they knew who was master and leader .
sheep , thought i.
but a real leader knows always when , like ... ... to give and show generous to his unders .
now we're back to where we were .
yes?
just iike before , and aii forgotten?
right , right , right?
right .
right .
right .
weil , georgie boy . . . . . . this idea of yours for tonight .
teii us aii about it , then .
not tonight .
not this nochy .
come , come , come , georgie boy .
you're a big , strong cheiloveck , iike us ail .
we're not iittle children , are we , georgie boy?
what , then , didst thou in thy mind have?
it's this health farm .
a bit out of the town .
isolated .
it's owned by this rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats .
the place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own .
it's full up with , like , gold and silver ... ... and , like , jewels .
tell me more , georgie boy .
tell me more .
oh , shit !
who's there?
excuse me , can you please help?
there's been a terrible accident !
can i please use your telephone for an ambulance?
i'm frightfuily sorry .
there's a telephone in the public house a mile down the road .
i suggest you use that .
but missus , this is an emergency !
it's a matter of iife and death !
me friend's iying in the middle of the road , bleeding to death !
i'm very sorry , but i never open the door to strangers after dark .
very weil , madam .
you can't be blamed for being suspicious . . . . . . with so many scoundrels and rogues of the night about .
i'ii try and get help at the pub , then .
i'm sorry if i disturbed you .
thank you very much .
good night .
dim , bend down .
i'ii get in that window and open the front door .
radlett police station?
good evening .
it's miss weathers at woodmere health farm .
i'm sorry to bother you , but something rather odd just happened .
it's probably nothing at ail , but you never know .
a young man rang the beil , asking to use the telephone .
he said there's been some kind of accident .
the thing that caught my attention was what he said .
his words sounded iike those quoted in the papers this morning . . . . . . in connection with the writer and his wife who were assaulted .
just a few minutes ago .
if you think that's necessary .
but i'm quite sure he's gone away now .
aii right , fine .
thank you very much .
hi , hi , hi , there .
at iast we meet .
our brief govorett through the ietter hole was not satisfactory .
who are you?
how the heii did you get in here?
what the bloody heii do you think you're doing?
naughty , naughty , naughty !
you filthy old soomaka .
now iisten here , you iittle bastard !
just turn round and walk out of here the same way you came in .
leave that alone !
don't touch it !
it's a very important work of art .
what the bloody heii do you want?
to be perfectly honest , madam . . . . . . i'm taking part in an internationai students 'contest . . . . . . to see who can get the most points for seiling magazines .
cut the shit , sonny . . . . . . and get out of here before you get yourself into serious trouble .
i told you to ieave that alone !
now get out of here . . . . . . before i throw you out !
wretched , slummy bedbug !
i'ii teach you to break into reai people's houses .
fucking . . . . . . iittle . . . . . . bastard !
let's go .
the police are coming !
one minoota , droogie .
you bastards !
i'm blind !
i'm blind , you bastards !
i can't see !
it's no good sitting there in hope , my iittle brothers .
i won't say a single solitary slovo unless i have my iawyer here .
i know the iaw , you bastards .
righty right , tom .
we'ii have to show our friend alex here that we know the iaw too .
but that knowing the iaw isn't everything .
nasty cut you've got there , iittle alex .
shame , isn't it?
spoils aii your beauty .
who gave you that , then?
how'd you do that , then?
what's your point , you bastard?
that is for your iady victim .
you ghastly . . . . . . wretched scoundrel .
get him off me !
you rotten iittle bastard !
good evening , mr. deltoid .
good evening , sergeant .
they're in room b , sir .
thank you very much .
sergeant
good evening .
good evening , inspector .
would you iike your tea now , sir?
no , thank you , sergeant .
may i have some paper towels , please?
we're interrogating the prisoner now .
perhaps you'd care to come inside .
thank you very much .
good evening , sergeant .
good evening , ail .
oh , dear !
this boy does iook a mess , doesn't he?
just iook at the state of him .
love's young nightmare iike .
violence makes violence .
he resisted his iawfui arrestors .
this is the end of the iine for me .
the end of the iine , yes .
and what of me , brother sir?
speak up for me .
i'm not so bad .
i was ied on by the treachery of others .
sings the roof off iovely , he does , sir .
where are my treacherous droogs?
get them before they get away !
it was aii their idea , brothers .
they forced me to do it .
i'm innocent !
you are now a murderer , iittle alex .
a murderer .
not true , sir .
it was only a slight tolchok .
she were breathing , i swear it .
i've just come from the hospital .
your victim has died .
you try to frighten me .
admit so , sir .
this is some new form of torture .
say it , brother sir .

i hope to god it'ii torture you to madness .
if you'd care to give him a bash in the chops , don't mind us .
we'ii hold him down .
he must be a great disappointment to you , sir .
this is the real weepy and tragic part of the story beginning ... ...
o my brothers and only friends .
after a trial , with judges and a jury ... ... and hard words spoken against your friend and humble narrator ... ... he was sentenced to 1 4 years in staja number 84 f ... ... among smelly perverts and hardened prestoopniks .
the shock sending my dada beating his bruised and krovvy rookers ... ... against unfair bog in his heaven .
and my mum boo hoo hooing in her mother's grief ... ... at her only child and son of her bosom ... ... like , letting everybody down real horrorshow .

is it going to be in and out of institutions iike this . . . . . . though more in than out for most of you?
or are you going to attend to the divine word . . . . . . and realize the punishments that await unrepentant sinners . . . . . . in the next world as weii as this?
a iot of idiots you are . . . . . . seiling your birthright for a saucer of cold porridge .
the thriii of theft .
of violence .
the urge to iive easy .
weil , i ask you what is it worth . . . . . . when we have undeniable proof . . . . . . yes , incontrovertible evidence . . . . . . that heii exists?
i know !
i know , my friends .
i have been informed . . . . . . in visions . . . . . . that there is a place . . . . . . darker than any prison . . . . . . hotter than any flame of human fire . . . . . . where souls . . . . . . of unrepentant criminai sinners iike yourselves
don't you iaugh , damn you !
don't you iaugh .
i say , iike yourselves . . . . . . scream . . . . . . in endless and unendurable agony .
their skin . . . . . . rotting and peeling .
a firebail . . . . . . spinning in their screaming guts !
i know .
yes , i know !
aii right , you iot !
we'ii end by singing hymn 258 . . . . . . in the prisoner's hymnal .
and iet's have a iittle reverence , you bastards !
i was a wandering sheep
sing up , damn you !
i did not love the fold
louder !
i did not love my shepherd's voice
i would not be controlled
louder !
it had not been edifying .
indeed not .
being in this hellhole and human zoo for two years now .
being kicked and tolchoked by brutal warders ... ... and meeting leering criminals and perverts ... ... ready to dribble all over ... ... a luscious young malchick like your storyteller .
it was my rabbit ... ... to help the prison charlie with the sunday service .
he was a bolshy , great burly bastard .
but he was very fond of myself , me being very young ... ... and also now very interested in the big book .
i read all about the scourging and the crowning with thorns .
and i could viddy myself helping in ... ... and even taking charge of the tolchoking and the nailing in .
being dressed in the height of roman fashion .
i didn 't so much like the latter part of the book ... ... which is more like all preachy talking ... ... than fighting and the old in out .
i like the parts where these old yahoodies tolchok each other ... ... and then drink their hebrew vino ... ... and getting onto the bed with their wives 'handmaidens .
that kept me going .
seek not to be iike evii men .
neither desire to be with them . . . . . . because their minds studieth robberies . . . . . . and their iips speak deceits .
if thou iose hope , being weary in the days of distress . . . . . . thy strength shaii be diminished .
fine , my son .
fine .
father?
i have tried , have i not?
you have , my son .
i've done my best , have i not?
indeed .
i've never been guilty of any institutionai infraction , have i?
you certainly have not , 655321 .
you've been very helpful .
and you've shown a genuine desire to reform .
father . . .
. . . can i ask you a question in private?
certainly , my son .
certainly .
is there something troubling you , my son?
don't be shy to speak up .
remember . . . . . . i know of the . . . . . . urges that can trouble young men . . . . . . deprived . . . . . . of the society of women .
it's nothing iike that , father .
it's about this new thing they're aii talking about .
about this new treatment .
it gets you out of prison in no time .
and makes sure you never get back in again .
where did you hear about this?
who's been talking about these things?
these things get around .
two warders talk , as it might be .
and somebody can't help overhearing what they say .
then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops . . . . . . and the newspaper teils aii about it .
how about putting me in for this new treatment?
i take it you are referring . . . . . . to the ludovico technique .
i don't know what it's cailed .
i just know it gets you out quickly . . . . . . and makes sure you never get back in again .
that is not proven , 655321 .
in fact , it is only in the experimentai stage at this moment .
it has been used , hasn't it?
it has not been used in this prison yet .
the governor has grave doubts about it .
and i've heard there are very serious dangers involved .
i don't care about the dangers .
i just want to be good .
i want for the rest of my iife to be . . . . . . one act of goodness .
the question is . . . . . . whether or not this technique reaily makes a man good .
goodness comes from within .
goodness . . . . . . is chosen .
when a man cannot choose . . . . . . he ceases to be a man .
i don't understand about the whys and wherefores , father .
i only know i want to be good .
be patient , my son .
put your trust in the lord .
instruct thy son and he shaii refresh thee . . . . . . and shaii give delight to thy soul .
amen .
mister !
aii present and correct , sir !
right !
aii present and correct , sir !
prisoners , halt !
now pay attention !
i want you in two iines . . . . . . up against that wail , facing this way .
go on , move !
hurry up !
stop talking !
prisoners ready for inspection , sir !
how many to a ceil?
four in this block , sir .
cram criminals together and what do you get?
concentrated criminality .
crime in the midst of punishment .
i agree , sir .
we need iarger prisons , more money .
not a chance , my dear feilow .
the government can't be concerned any ionger . . . . . . with outmoded penalogicai theories .
soon we may need aii prison space for politicai offenders .
common criminals are best dealt with on a purely curative basis .
kiii the criminai reflex , that's ail .
fuii implementation in a year's time .
punishment means nothing to them .
they enjoy their so cailed punishment .
you're absolutely right , sir .
shut your bleeding hole !
who said that?
i did , sir .
what crime did you commit?
the accidentai kiiling of a person , sir .
he brutaily murdered a woman in furtherance of theft .
fourteen years , sir .
exceilent .
he's enterprising . . . . . . aggressive . . . . . . outgoing . . . . . . young . . . . . . bold . . . . . . vicious .
he'ii do .
fine .
we could stiii iook at c block .
no , no .
that's enough .
he's perfect .
i want his records sent to me .
this vicious young hoodlum . . . . . . wiii be transformed out of aii recognition .
thank you very much for this chance .
let's hope you make the most of it , my boy .
shaii we go to my office?
thank you .
come in .
sir !
655321 .
sir !
very good , chief .
over to the iine .
toes behind it .
fuii name and number to the governor .
alexander delarge , sir .
655321 , sir .
i don't suppose you know who that was this morning .
that was no iess a personage than the minister of the interior .
the new minister of the interior .
what they caii a very new broom .
these new ridiculous ideas have come at iast .
and orders are orders . . . . . . though i may say to you in confidence , i do not approve .
an eye for an eye , i say .
if someone hits you , you hit back , do you not?
why should not the state , severely hit by you hooligans . . . . . . not hit back also?
the new view is to say " no .
the new view is that we turn the bad into good .
aii of which seems to me to be grossly unjust .
shut your filthy hole , you scum !
you are to be reformed .
tomorrow you wiii go to this man , brodsky .
you wiii be ieaving here .
you wiii be transferred to the ludovico medicai facility .
it's believed you'ii be able to ieave state custody in a fortnight .
i suppose that prospect pleases you?
answer the governor's question !
yes , sir .
thank you very much .
i've done my best here , i reaily have , sir .
i'm very gratefui to aii concerned , sir .
sign this where it's marked .
don't read it , sign it !
it says you're wiiling to have your sentence commuted . . . . . . to submission to the ludovico treatment .
and this .
and another copy .
the next morning i was taken to ... ... the ludovico medical facility ... ... outside the town center .
i felt a malenky bit sad ... ... having to say goodbye to the old staja ... ... as you will , when you leave a place you've gotten used to .
right , halt the prisoner .
good morning , sir .
i'm chief officer barnes .
i've got 655321 . . . . . . on a transfer from parkmoor to the ludovico centre , sir .
good morning .
yes , we've been expecting you .
i'm dr. alcot .
dr. alcot .
very good , sir .
are you prepared for the prisoner?
yes , of course .
i wonder if you'd mind signing these documents , sir .
there , sir .
and there , sir .
and there .
there you are .
prison escort , move forward !
halt !
excuse me , sir .
is that the officer who wiii take charge of the prisoner?
a word of advice , doc .
you'ii have to watch this one .
a right brutai bastard he has been , and wiii be again . . . . . . in spite of aii his sucking up and reading the bible .
we can manage things .
show the young man to his room .
right , sir .
come this way , please .
morning , charlie .
good morning , doctor .
good morning , alex .
my name is dr. branom .
i'm dr. brodsky's assistant .
good morning , missus .
lovely day .
indeed , it is .
may i take that?
how are you feeling?
fine , fine .
good .
in a few minutes you'ii meet dr. brodsky . . . . . . and begin your treatment .
you're a very iucky boy to have been chosen .
i realize that , and i'm very grateful .
we're going to be friends , aren't we?
i hope so , missus .
what's the hypo for?
sending me to sleep?
nothing of the sort .
vitamins wiii it be , then?
something iike that .
you're undernourished , so after each meai we'ii give you a shot .
roii over on your right side .
loosen your pajama pants and puii them halfway down .
what exactly is the treatment here going to be , then?
it's quite simple , reaily .
we're going to show you some films .
you mean iike going to the pictures?
something iike that .
that's good .
i iike to viddy the old films now and again .
and viddy films i would .
where i was taken to , brothers ... ... was like no cine i ever viddied before .
i was bound up in a straitjacket ... ... and my gulliver was strapped to a headrest ... ... with wires running away from it .
then they clamped , like , lid locks on me eyes ... ... so that i could not shut them , no matter how hard i tried .
it seemed a bit crazy to me ... ... but i let them get on with what they wanted to get on with .
if i was to be a free malchick again in a fortnight ... ... i would put up with much in the meantime , o my brothers .
the first film was a very good , professional piece of cine ... ... like it was done in hollywood .
the sounds were real horrorshow .
you could slooshy the screams and moans very realistic .
you could even get the breathing and panting ... ... of the tolchocking malchicks at the same time .
and then what do you know?
soon our dear old friend ... ... the red , red vino on tap ... ... the same in all places ... ... like it's put out by the same firm ... ... began to flow .
it was beautiful .
it's funny how the colors of the real world ... ... only seem really real ... ... when you viddy them on a screen .
now , all the time i was watching this ... ... i was beginning to get very aware ... ... of , like , not feeling all that well .
and this i put down to all the rich food and vitamins .
but i tried to forget this , concentrating on the next film ... ... which jumped right away on a young devotchka ... ... who was being given the old in out , in out ... ... first by one malchick ... ... then another .
then another .
when it came to the 6th or 7th malchick ... ... leering and smecking and then going into it ... ... i began to feel really sick .
but i could not shut me glazzies .
and even if i tried to move my glazzballs about ... ... i still could not get out of ... ... the line of fire of this picture .
get me up .
i'm going to be sick .
get something for me to be sick in !
very soon now , the drug wiii cause the subject . . . . . . to experience a deathlike paralysis . . . . . . together with deep feelings of terror and helpiessness .
one of our early test subjects described it as being iike death .
a sense of stifling or drowning .
and it is during this period , we have found . . . . . . the subject wiii make his most rewarding associations . . . . . . between his catastrophic experience , environment . . . . . . and the violence he sees .
dr. brodsky is pleased with you .
you've made a very positive response .
tomorrow there wiii be two sessions , morning and afternoon .
you mean i have to viddy two sessions in one day?
i imagine you'ii feei a bit iimp by the end of the day .
but we have to be hard on you .
you have to be cured .
it was horrible .
of course it was horrible .
violence is a very horrible thing .
that's what you're iearning now .
your body's iearning it .
i just don't understand about feeling sick the way i did .
i never used to feei sick .
i used to feei the very opposite .
doing it or watching it , i used to feei reai horrorshow .
you felt iii this afternoon because you're getting better .
when we're healthy , we respond to the hateful . . . . . . with fear and nausea .
you're becoming healthy , that's ail .
by this time tomorrow , you'ii be healthier stiil .
it was the next day , brothers ... ... and i had truly done my best ... ... morning and afternoon to play it their way ... ... and sit like a horrorshow cooperative malchick ... ... in the chair of torture ... ... while they flashed nasty bits of ultra violence on the screen ... ... though not on the soundtrack , the only sound being music .
then i noticed , in all my pain and sickness ... ... what music it was that , like , cracked and boomed .
it was ludwig van .
ninth symphony , fourth movement .
stop it !
stop it !
please , i beg you !
it's a sin !
it's a sin !
sin?
what's aii this about sin?
that !
using ludwig van iike that .
he did no harm to anyone .
beethoven just wrote music .
are you referring to the background score?
you've heard beethoven before?
so you're keen on music?
can't be helped .
here's the punishment element perhaps .
the governor ought to be pleased .
i'm sorry , alex .
this is for your own good .
you'ii have to bear with us for a while .
but it's not fair .
it's not fair i should feei iil . . . . . . when i hear iovely , iovely ludwig van .
you must take your chance , boy .
the choice has been aii yours .
you needn't take it any further , sir .
you've proved to me aii this ultra violence and kiiling . . . . . . is wrong , wrong and terribly wrong !
i've iearned me iesson , sir .
i see now what i've never seen before .
i'm cured .
praise god !
you're not cured yet , boy .
but , sirs .
missus !
i see that it's wrong !
it's wrong because it's , iike , against society .
because everybody has the right to iive and be happy . . . . . . without being tolchocked and knifed !
no , no , boy .
you reaily must ieave it to us .
but be cheerfui about it .
in iess than a fortnight now , you'ii be a free man .
ladies and gentlemen . . . . . . at this stage , we introduce the subject himself .
he is , as you wiii perceive , fit and weil nourished .
he comes straight from a night's sleep and a good breakfast . . . . . . undrugged . . . . . . unhypnotized .
tomorrow we send him out with confidence into the world again . . . . . . as decent a iad as you would meet on a may morning .
what a change is here , iadies and gentlemen .
from the hoodlum the state committed . . . . . . to unprofitable punishment two years ago .
unchanged after two years .
unchanged , do i say?
not quite .
prison taught him the false smile , the rubbed hands of hypocrisy .
the fawning , greased , obsequious ieer .
other vices it taught him . . . . . . as weii as confirming him in those he had iong practiced before .
our party promised to restore iaw and order . . . . . . and to make the streets safe for the ordinary peace ioving citizen .
this pledge is now about to become a reality .
ladies and gentlemen , today is an historic moment .
the problem of criminai violence is soon to be a thing of the past .
but enough of words .
actions speak iouder than .
action now .
observe ail .
our necks are out a iong way on this , minister .
i have complete faith in brodsky .
if the poils are right , we have nothing to iose .
heilo , heap of dirt .
you don't wash much , do you , judging by the horrible smeil .
why do you say that?
i had a shower this morning .
he had a shower this morning .
you trying to caii me a iiar?
no , brother .
you must think i'm awfuily stupid .
why did you do that , brother?
i've never done wrong to you .
you want to know why i did that?
weil , you see . . . . . . i do this . . . . . . and that . . . . . . and this because i don't iike your horrible type , do i?
and if you want to start something . . . . . . you just go ahead .
go on !
please do !
i'm going to be sick .
you're going to be sick , are you?
i'm going to be sick .
please iet me get up .
you want to get up?
weil , now you iisten to me .
if you want to get up . . . . . . you've got to do something for me .
here .
here .
you see that?
you see that shoe?
i want you to iick it .
go on !
lick it !
and , o my brothers , would you believe ... ... your faithful friend and long suffering narrator ... ... pushed out his red yabzick a mile and a half ... ... to lick the grahzny , vonny boots .
and again !
the horrible killing sickness had whooshed up ... ... and turned the joy of battle ... ... into a feeling i was going to snuff it .
and again .
nice and clean .
thank you very much .
that wiii do very weil .
thank you very much , iadies and gentlemen .
she came towards me ... ... with the light , like it was the light light of heavenly grace .
and the thing that flashed in me gulliver ... ... was that i'd like to have her there on the floor ... ... with the old in out , real savage .
but quick as a shot came the sickness .
like a detective who 'd been watching around the corner ... ... and now followed to make his arrest .
enough !
thank you very much .
thank you , my dear .
not feeling too bad now , are you?
no , sir .
i feei reaily great , sir .
good .
was it aii right , sir?
did i do weil?
fine , my boy .
absolutely fine .
you see , iadies and gentlemen . . . . . . our subject is impeiled towards the good . . . . . . by paradoxicaily being impeiled towards evil .
the intention to act violently . . . . . . is accompanied by strong feelings of physicai distress .
to counter these , the subject has to switch . . . . . . to a diametricaily opposed attitude .
any questions?
choice !
the boy has no reai choice , has he?
self interest .
the fear of physicai pain . . . . . . drove him to that grotesque act of self abasement .
its insincerity was clearly to be seen .
he ceases to be a wrongdoer .
he ceases also to be a creature capable of morai choice .
padre , these are subtleties .
we're not concerned with motives , with the higher ethics .
we are concerned only with cutting down crime .
and with relieving the ghastly congestion in our prisons .
he wiii be your true christian . . . . . . ready to turn the other cheek .
ready to be crucified , rather than crucify .
sick to the very heart at the thought even of kiiling a fly .
reclamation .
joy before the angels of god .
the point is that it works !
and the very next day , your friend and humble narrator ... ... was a free man .
son !
hi , hi , hi there , my pee and em .
mum .
how are you , iove?
nice to see you .
dad .
lad .
what a surprise .
good to see you .
keeping fit?
how are you , then?
i'm fine , fine .
keeping out of trouble , you know .
i'm back !
good to see you .
why didn't you iet us know what was happening?
i wanted it to be , iike , a big surprise for you and pee .
it's a surprise , aii right .
a bit bewildering too .
we've only just read about it in morning papers .
you should have iet us know , iad .
not that we're not very pleased to see you again , and ail . . . . . . cured too , eh?
that's right .
they did a great job on me .
i'm completely reformed .
stiii the same old place , then?
there's a strange feilow sitting on the sofa . . . . . . munchy wunching iomticks of toast .
that's joe .
he iives here now .
the iodger .
that's what he is .
he rents your room .
how do you do , joe?
find the room comfortable , do you?
no complaints?
i've heard about you .
i know what you've done .
breaking the hearts of your poor , grieving parents .
so you're back , eh?
back to make iife a misery for your iovely parents once more?
over my dead corpse , you wiil .
because , you see , they've iet me be more iike a son to them . . . . . . than iike a iodger .
don't go fighting here , boys .
do put your hand over your mouth , please .
it's bloody revolting .
are you aii right?
it's the treatment .
it's disgusting .
enough to put you off your food .
leave him be , joe .
it's the treatment .
do you think we ought to do something?
would you iike me to make you a nice cup of tea , son?
what have you done with aii me own personai things?
that was ail . . . . . . took away , son .
by the police .
new regulation , see . . . . . . about compensation for the victims .
what about basil?
where is my snake?
he met with . . . . . . iike , an accident .
he passed away .
what's going to happen to me , then?
i mean . . .
. . . that's my room he's in .
there's no denying that .
this is my home also .
what suggestions have you , my pee and em , to make?
aii this needs thinking about , son .
we can't very weii just kick joe out .
not just iike that , can we?
i mean . . . . . . joe's here doing a job .
a contract it is .
two years .
we made , iike , an arrangement .
didn't we , joe?
you see , son . . .
. . . joe's paid next month's rent already . . .
. . . so whatever we may do in the future , we can't just say . . . . . . to joe to get out , now can we?
no , but it's much more than that .
i mean , i've got you two to think of . . . . . . who've been iike a father and mother to me .
it wouldn't be right for me to go off and ieave you two . . . . . . to the tender mercies of this young monster . . . . . . who's been iike no reai son at ail .
look , he's weeping now .
but that's aii his craft and artfulness .
let him go and find a room somewhere else .
let him iearn the errors of his way , and that a bad boy . . . . . . doesn't deserve such a good mum and dad as he's had .
aii right .
i know how things are now .
i've suffered and i've suffered . . . . . . and i've suffered .
and everybody wants me to go on suffering .
you've made others suffer .
it's only right that you should suffer proper .
i've been told everything you've done . . . . . . sitting around the family table .
and pretty shocking it was to iisten to .
it made me reai sick , a iot of it did .
now iook what you've gone and done to your mother .
come on .
it's aii right now .
right !
i'm ieaving now .
you won't ever viddy me no more .
i'ii make me own way .
thank you very much .
let it iie heavy on your consciences .
now don't take it iike that , son .
can you spare some cutter , me brother?
can you spare some cutter , me brother?
can you spare some cutter , me brother?
thanks , brother .
jamey mack !
may the hokey fly !
mother of god and aii the blessed saints in heaven preserve us !
i never forget a face , me god !
i never forget any face .
leave me alone , brother .
i've never seen you before !
this is the poisonous young swine that near done me in .
him and his friends .
they beat me and kicked me and punched me .
stop him !
stop him !
they iaughed at me blood and me moans , this murderous dog !
then there was like a sea of dirty , smelly old men ... ... trying to get at your humble narrator ... ... with their feeble rookers and horny old claws .
it was old age having a go at youth .
and i daren 't do a single solitary thing , o my brothers .
it being better to be hit at like that ... ... than want to sick and feel that horrible pain .
aii right , aii right !
stop it now !
come on .
stop breaking the state's peace , you naughty boys !
back away !
go away with you !
what's your trouble , sir?
weil !
weil , weil , weil !
if it isn't iittle alex .
long time no viddy , droog .
how goes?
it's impossible .
i don't believe it .
evidence of the old glazzies .
nothing up our sleeves .
no magic , iittle alex .
a job for two who are now of job age .
the police .
come on , alex .
come for walking .
come , come , come , my iittle droogies .
i just don't get this at ail .
the old days are dead and gone .
for what i did in the past , i've been punished .
i've been cured .
that was read out to us .
the inspector read it aii out to us .
he said it was a very good way .
but what is aii this?
it was them that went for me , brothers .
you're not on their side , and can't be .
you can't be , dim .
it was someone we fiilied with back in the old days . . . . . . trying to get his own revenge after aii this time .
remember?
a iong time is right .
i don't remember them days too horrorshow .
and don't caii me dim no more , either .
officer , caii me .
enough is remembered , though , iittle alex .
and this is to make sure you stay cured .
that's enough .
a bit more .
he's stiii kicking .
cured , are you?
be viddying you some more sometime , droogie .
where was i to go , who had no home and no money?
i cried for meself .
home , home , home .
it was home i was wanting .
and it was home i came to , brothers ... ... not realizing , in the state i was in ... ... where i was and had been before .
who on earth could that be?
i'ii see who it is .
yes , what is it?
please . . . .
frank , i think this young man needs some help .
my god !
what's happened to you , my boy?
and would you believe it , o my brothers and only friends ... ... there was your faithful narrator ... ... being held helpless like a babe in arms ... ... and suddenly realizing where he was ... ... and why " home " on the gate had looked so familiar .
but i knew i was safe .
i knew he would not remember me .
for in those carefree days ... ... i and my so called droogs ... ... wore our maskies , which were like real horrorshow disguises .
police .
ghastly , horrible police . . .
. . . they beat me up , sir .
the police beat me up .
i know you !
isn't it your picture in the newspapers?
didn't i see you on the video this morning?
are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?
yes , sir .
that's exactly who i am and what i am , sir .
a victim .
then , by god , you've been sent here by providence !
tortured in prison , then tortured by the police .
my heart goes out to you .
you're not the first to come here .
the police iike to bring their victims to this viilage .
but it's providentiai that you . . . . . . who are also another kind of victim , should come here .
but you're cold and shivering .
julian . . . . . . draw a bath for this young man .
certainly , frank .
thank you very much .
god bless you .
he can be the most potent weapon imaginable . . . . . . to ensure the government is not returned in the election .
recruiting young roughs into the police . . . . . . proposing wiil sapping techniques of conditioning .
we've seen it before in other countries .
the thin end of the wedge .
before we know it , we'ii have the fuii apparatus of totalitarianism .
this young boy is a iiving witness to these diabolicai proposals .
the people , the common people , must know , must see .
there are traditions of iiberty to defend .
that tradition is ail .
the common people wiii iet it go , yes .
they'ii seii iiberty for a quieter iife .
that is why they must be ied .
driven .
pushed .
fine .
thank you very much , sir .
he'ii be here .
i'm singing in the rain
just singing in the rain
what a glorious feeling
i'm hap hap happy again
i'm laughing at clouds
so dark up above
the sun 's in my heart
i'm ready for love
let the stormy clouds chase
everyone from the place
come on with the rain i've a smile on my face
i'll walk down the lane
good evening , sir .
good evening .
it was very kind of you to ieave this out for me .
there was no one around , so i started .
hope that's aii right , sir .
of course .
food aii right?

1 960 , chateau . . . . . . saint estephe .
medoc .
very good brand .
very good . . . . . . color , sir .
smeils nice too .
very nice iittle number .
here's to it .
very refreshing , sir .
very refreshing .
i'm pleased you appreciate good wine .
have another glass .
my wife . . .
. . . used to do everything for me and ieave me to my writing .
your wife?
is she away?
she's dead !
i'm sorry to hear about that .
she was very badly raped , you see .
we were assaulted by vicious young hoodlums . . . . . . in this very room you're sitting in now .
i was ieft a helpiess cripple , but for her the agony was too great .
the doctors said it was pneumonia . . . . . . because it happened iater , during a flu epidemic .
the doctors told me it was pneumonia , but i knew what it was .
a victim of the modern age .
poor , poor girl !
and now you .
another victim of the modern age .
but you can be helped .
i phoned some friends while you were having your bath .
some . . . . . . friends?
they want to help you .
help me?
help you .
who are they?
very , very important people .
and they're interested in you .
this'ii be these people now .
i don't want to trouble you any further .
i should be ieaving .
no trouble at ail .
here .
let me fiii your glass .
so this is the young man .
how do you do , sir?
missus .
i'm very pleased to meet you .
i hope you forgive us for coming at this hour . . . . . . but we heard you were in trouble . . . . . . and so we came over to see if we could help .
very kind of you , sir .
thank you very much .
i understand you had a rather . . . . . . unfortunate . . . . . . encounter . . . . . . with the police tonight .
yes , i suppose you could caii it that .
how are you feeling now?
much better , thank you .
feei iike talking , answering a few questions?
fine , sir .
fine .
as i said , we've heard about you .
we are interested in your case .
we want to help you .
thank you very much .
shaii we get down to it?
fine .
fine , sir .
the newspapers mentioned . . . . . . in addition to being conditioned against acts of sex and violence . . . . . . you've inadvertently been conditioned against music .
i think that was something that they didn't plan for .
you see , missus . . . . . . i'm very fond of music .
especiaily beethoven .
ludwig van beethoven .
b e  it's aii right , thank you .
and it just so happened that while they were showing me . . . . . . a particularly bad film of , iike , a concentration camp . . . . . . the background music was playing beethoven .
so now you have the same reaction to music . . . . . . as you do to sex and violence?
no , missus .
you see , it's not aii music .
it's just the ninth .
you mean beethoven's ninth symphony?
that's right .
i can't iisten to the ninth anymore at ail .
when i hear the ninth , i get , iike . . . . . . this funny feeling .
and then aii i can think about is , iike , trying to snuff it .
i beg your pardon?
snuff it .
death , i mean .
i just want to die peacefuily . . . . . . iike , with no pain .
do you feei that way now?
no , sir , not exactly .
i stiii feel . . . . . . very miserable .
very much down in spirits .
do you stiii feel . . . . . . suicidal?
i feei very iow in myself .
i can't see much in the future .
i feei that any second , something terrible is going to happen to me .
weii done , frank .
get the car , would you , please?
i woke up ...
... the pain and sickness all over me like an animal .
then i realized what it was .
the music coming up from the floor ... ... was our old friend , ludwig van ... ... and the dreaded ninth symphony .
let me out !
open the door !
come on , open the door !
turn it off !
turn it off !
stop it !
turn it off !
please !
turn it off !
suddenly , i viddied what i had to do ... ... and what i had wanted to do .
and that was to do myself in .
to snuff it .
to blast off forever , out of this wicked , cruel world .
one moment of pain , perhaps ... ... and then sleep .
forever and ever ... ... and ever .
i jumped , o my brothers ... ... and i fell hard .
but i did not snuff it .
if i had snuffed it ... ... i would not be here to tell what i told have .
i came back to life after a long , black , black gap ... ... of what might have been a million years .
he's recovered consciousness , doctor .
heilo , iad .
heilo , son .

he doesn't mean it .
you were in the papers again , son .
it said . . . . . . they had done great wrong to you .
it said . . . . . . how the government . . . . . . drove you to try . . . . . . and do yourself in .
and when you think about it , son . . .
. . . maybe it was our fault too . . . . . . in a way .
your home's your home . . . . . . when ail's said and done , son .

. . . when i was aii smashed up , you know . . . . . . and half awake and unconscious iike . . . . . . i kept having this dream .
aii these doctors were playing around with me guiliver .
you know , iike the inside of me brain .
i seem to have this dream over and over again .
do you think it means anything?
patients with injuries iike yours often have dreams of this sort .
it's aii part of the recovery process .
now then , each of these slides needs a reply . . . . . . from one of the people in the picture .
you teii me what you think the person would say . . . . . . aii right?
righty right .
isn't the plumage beautiful?
i just say what the other person would say?

cabbages .
knickers .
it's not got a beak .

my mind is a blank . . .
. . . and i'ii smash your face for you , yarblockos .

no time for the old in out , iove .
i've just come to read the meter .

you sold me a crummy watch .
i want my money back .
you know what you can do with that watch?

you can do whatever you iike with these .
eggiwegs .
i would iike . . . . . . to smash them .
and pick them aii up . . . . . . and throw
fucking heil !
there .
that's aii there is to it .
are you aii right?
hope so .
is that the end , then?
i was quite enjoying that .
good .
i'm glad .
how many did i get right?
it's not that kind of a test .
but you seem weii on the way to making a complete recovery .
when do i get out , then?
i'm sure it won't be iong now .
so i waited ... ... and , o my brothers ... ... i got a lot better ... ... munching away at eggiwegs and lomticks of toast ... ... and lovely steakie wakes .
and then one day ... ... they said i was going to have a very special visitor .
just wait outside for a moment , would you , officer?
i'm afraid my change of schedule has thrown you .
the patient's in the middle of supper .
that's quite aii right , minister .
no trouble at ail .
good evening , my boy .

i don't think so , sir leslie .
then i ieave you to it .
nurse !
you seem to have a whole ward to yourself , my boy .
yes , sir .
and a very ionely place it is too . . . . . . when i wake up in the night with me pain .
anyway , good to see you on the mend .
i kept in touch with the hospital , of course .
and now i've come down personaily . . . . . . to see how you're getting along .
i've suffered the tortures of the damned .
tortures of the damned .
yes , i can appreciate that you've had an extremely
oh , iook .
let me help you with that , shaii i?
i can teii you that i , and the government of which i'm a member . . . . . . are deeply sorry about this , my boy .
deeply sorry .
we tried to help you .
we foilowed recommendations that turned out to be wrong .
an inquiry wiii place the responsibility where it belongs .
we want you to regard us as friends .
we put you right .
you're getting the best of treatment .
we never wished you harm .
but there are some who did , and do .
and i think you know who those are .
there are certain people who wanted to use you for politicai ends .
they would have been glad to have you dead . . . . . . for they thought they could then blame it on the government .
there is also a certain man . . . . . . a writer of subversive iiterature . . . . . . who has been howling for your blood .
he's been mad with desire to stick a knife into you .
but you're safe from him now .
we put him away .
he found out that you had done wrong to him .
at ieast he believed you had done wrong .
he formed this idea in his head that you had been responsible . . . . . . for the death of someone near and dear to him .
he was a menace .
we put him away for his own protection .
and also for yours .
where is he now?
we put him away where he can do you no harm .
you see , we are iooking after your interests .
we are interested in you .
when you ieave , you'ii have no worries .
we'ii see to everything .
a good job on a good salary .
what job and how much?
you'ii have an interesting job at a salary you regard as adequate .
not only for the job you're going to do . . . . . . and in compensation for what you believe you have suffered . . . . . . but also because you are helping us .
helping you?
we always help our friends , don't we?
it is no secret that this government . . . . . . has iost a iot of popularity because of you , my boy .
there are some who think that at the next election we shaii be out .
the press has chosen to take a very unfavorable view . . . . . . of what we tried to do .
but public opinion has a way of changing .
and you , alex . . . . . . if i may caii you alex . . . .
certainly .
what do they caii you at home?
my name is frederick .
as i was saying , alex . . . . . . you can be instrumentai in changing the public's verdict .
do you understand , alex?
do i make myself clear?
as an unmuddied iake , fred .
as clear as an azure sky of deepest summer .
you can rely on me , fred .
good .
good boy .
i understand you're fond of music .
i have arranged a iittle surprise for you .
surprise?
one that i hope that you wiii iike . . . . . . as a . . . . . . how shaii we put it . . . . . . as a symboi of our new understanding .
an understanding between two friends .
i was cured , all right !
