mirabelle buttersfield moved from vermount , hoping to begin her life
and now she is stranded in the vast openness of l. a.
she keeps working to make connections ..
but the pile of near misses is starting to overwhelm her
what mirabelle needs is an ominationed voice to illuminate and spotlight her .
and to inform everyone .. .. that this one has value .
this one , standing behind the counter in the glove department .
and to find her counterpart .. .. and bring him to her .
come on .
come on out .

you see , susan .
your husband doesn't understand that it's .. .. afterglow that's important to a woman .
uh huh .
much more important than the sex act itself .
cool .
a woman needs to be held .. .. even if , and science has shown this , it's by someone she doesn't care about .
protective hormones are released and the amount of hormones .. .. released depends on the degree to which she is held .
the first in best is the complete surround .
he wraps you in those arms , whispers how beautiful you are ..
second best is the arm around .
he's next to you but with one arm around you .
third is he's just next to you on his elbow .
but he rests his hand on your stomach and looks at you .
fourth is you snuggling up to him with your head on his chest .
well , he looks away into space .
but when the first best happens you feel completely wonderfully .. .. like a woman .
god .. !

amplifiers are so underappreciated .

it pisses me off .
mac designs a cool computer , everybody goes out and they buy it !
and .. a band !
a rock n 'roll band .. .. lives or dies .
bother amplifiers .. and they're sold .. .. like fridgerators .
hell , it's that ridiculous , come on !
the amp should have a stick !
i mean : yeah .
i mean : amp should still be like cool things !
you know , like cars .
like swords !
not like appliances .
and that is why .. that is why my boss , my business is going under .
because .. he , he , he's used his all his merch .
that's merchandise .
maybe you should do something about it?
huh?
he's never coming to my party again .
never .
pather's so .. fat .
uh , at worst .
that was like he was going to lose his grip .
you want something?

excuse me?
oh .. yes , i'm sorry?
is he famous?
i'm not sure ..
extraterrestrials?

how'd you know who he was then?
osmosis .
would you like to see something?
yeah ..
those , uh .. .. gray ones and those black ones .
okay .
how does it work?
is it one size fits all or ..?
they come in different sizes , but mostly they'll fit anybody .
unless .. you know .
she's ..
big .
i don't know .
what do you think?
well , it depends on the dress .
what color is the dress?
um ..

while ray porter explains his presumption and getting her address .. .. and sending her the gloves .. .. mirabelle sighes him up and no alarm bell sounds .
she asks him several questions and gets a particular kind of checklist .. .. for a man over 50 .
divorced , two houses , one in l. a. and one in computer oriented seattle .. .. which is source of his wealth .
what time?
8 .

we see each other but we don't know each other .
i'm lisa .
mirabelle .
you ever have men ask you out of the store?
daily .
and do you ever go out with them?
depends .
somebody asked you out?
you want some advice?
you never call him .
but if he calls you you talk to him .. .. then act like you have another call .
keep him on for a long time .
like the longer than you think it is possible .
and break dates .
always break dates .
right there on the holidays , and then he is just stuck .
and fellatio .
the sooner the better .
and a lot .

she's .. you know , she's really too young for me .
but you wanted to sleep with her .
oh yeah .
he said he wants to give it a try .
and i said that even if i know that this is not long term i still want to see her .
and she understood?
oh yeah .
he said he wants to cut down on his travelling .. .. i recently said that i like to sleep with her when i'm in town .
is it he might .. you know , stop travelling completely .. .. and then we'd decide what to do it at that point .
even though it's a sexual relationship .. .. we still should be able to meet other people .
so he was really taking with you?
yeah , it seemed like it .
so you were really clear with her that this relationship has no future?
absolutely .
well .
you know how to find out if he really loves you?
how?
you call him sweetheart and watch what he does .

i've been reading a lot of books on tape .. .. about .. .. getting into the moment .
and .
i think .
this is the moment .

so i did it .
that's not very much .
yeah , but ..
i'll protect you .
i will !
some nights alone he thinks of her .
and some nights alone .. .. she thinks of him .
some nights these thoughts occur at the same moment .
and ray and mirabelle are connected without ever knowing it .
but mirabelle , now feeling the warmth of her first reciprocal love .. .. has broken away from him .
and as jeremy offers her more of his heart ,
mirabelle offers equal parts of herself in return .
one night , sooner than she would have liked .. .. which made it irresistible .. .. they make love for the second time in 14 months .
at this point .. .. jeremy surpasses ray porter as a lover of mirabelle .. .. because what he offers her .. .. is tender .. .. and true .
so .
the night we'll go from influe , one of those yeah . read of .. uhh , um ..
yeah .
d , d , d , d ..

thank you .
and , uh ..
just so you know .
i'm sorry for the way i treated you .
i know .
i did love you .
all right .
as ray porter watched his mirabelle walk away .. .. he feels a loss .
how is it possible .. he thinks . .. to miss a woman whom he kept at a distance .. .. so that when she was gone .. .. he would not miss her .
only then did he realise how wanting part of her .. .. and not all of her .. .. had hurt them both .. .. and how he cannot justify his actions .. .. except that .. .. well .. .. it was life .
