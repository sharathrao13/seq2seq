you're a funny guy .
you really don't care if i'm interested in you?
in french , if the adjective comes after the noun instead of before , is the meaning the same?
what'd you mean?
for example , is a " blessed event " the same as " an event that's blessed "?
is that why you're sad?
then why?
because i'd like to be in a musical comedy starring cyd charisse and gene kelly .

a steak .
had you answered roast , would you prefer it rare or well done?
rare .
well , honey , you're out of luck .
my roast beef's a bit overdone .
are you mad?
it's nothing to fight about .

i don't know whether to laugh or cry .
i find a crying woman ugly .
i don't .
on the contrary .
that's what agnes said .
nothing's more beautiful than a woman in tears .
we should boycott women who don't cry .
modern women are stupid ... when they try to elim ...
that isn't it .
a woman who can't cry is stupid .

what limits?
i'm acting just like you .
women have a right to dodge issues , mr. emile .
men don't .
by what right?
because .

i don't love you .
okay , angela , that's peachy .
peachy and cream .
farewell , camille .
return to your convent .
all men are lying , fickle , false , garrulous , hypocritical and arrogant .
in love , we are often betrayed , often hurt , and often unhappy .
but we love .
and on the brink of the grave we turn to look back and we say ,
'i have often suffered ,
i have sometimes been mistaken , but i have loved .
i have lived my life and not some substitute forged out of my pride and world weariness . " '
she exits .

be right back .
why do men always leave saying " be right back "?
they're cowards .
it makes up for all women being ugly .
<i>in that case , i'll sulk . </ i>
<i>there , she's sulking . </ i>
<i>i hope you realize i'm sulking . </ i>
i'm ignoring it on purpose .
then there's no reason to sulk .
i'm not sulking , so that you'll stop sulking .
men always have the last word .
women always act like victims .
in that case , i refuse to sulk .
then i'll sulk .
what do we do?
whatever you like .
i'll join you at the zodiac .
if we do it , i must see you naked .

hi , angela .
been here long?
no , 27 years .
what'll you have?
a dubonnet .
what shall we talk about?
dunno .
i'm scared .
so am i.
i'm scared .
did my call today surprise you?
i wonder .
were you glad?
i wonder .
what'll we talk about?
i don't know .
i'm thinking .
in the morning paper ... there was a funny article .
what?
a girl's in love with two guys at the same time .
she sends them express letters , arranging to meet them , the first at gare du nord , and the other , two hours later , in southern paris .
she sends them off .
and just as they go off ... she realizes she mixed up the envelopes .
the letter which starts " paul darling " is in the envelope to pierre , and vice versa .
so she's in a panic .
she rushes to the first guy's place .
the letter hasn't arrived yet .
so she says , " darling , you'll get an express letter .
don't believe what's in it .
so she has to explain everything .
in the end , he throws her out when he learns she's got another guy .
so she thinks ,
i've lost one , but i still have the other one .
she rushes across town to see the second guy .
but he's received her letter .
the guy doesn't seem at all upset .
on the contrary .
she says , " you're so sweet .
you forgive me .
he's surprised but keeps quiet .
she tells him the story , thinking he wants to humiliate her first .
then , suddenly , he throws her out , too , as he shows her his letter .
and she realizes she hadn't mixed up the envelopes .
and then?
nothing .
she was a bit like you .
me?
not on your life .
i don't mean the story .
but ...
i dunno ... the personality .
always getting things wrong .
no kidding .
why're you looking at me that way?
because i love you .
come off it .
i do .
i didn't sleep last night .
i realized that .
all by yourself?
of course .
it's not true .
does that bother you?
that it's not true?
i don't know .
yes , it's true .
i don't know what's true or not .
i always get things wrong .
but there's no way of knowing .
for example , tell me a lie .
it's raining .
and now the truth .
the sun's out .
what's wrong?
your expression didn't change .
so what?
but the truth should look different from a lie .
what of it?
you just need to know .
you know .
but others don't have to believe you .
and that's too bad .
it means every man for himself .
people always manage somehow .
that's just it .
it's sad .
why don't you believe i love you?
because i want to be sure .
so do i.
you're not even sure?
about me , yes .
but not you .
then everything's okay .
no , it's not .
but for me it doesn't matter whether i love you or not .
<i>have pity on two blind men . </ i>
not with me , you don't .
oops , sorry .
it's these dark glasses .
you can't see a thing .
i never saw them before .
we were informers together .
the one in blue is albert .
i like him .
he came up with a neat stunt .
he wrote to pregnant women saying ,
send me 10 francs , and i'll predict your child's sex .
if i'm wrong , i'll refund your money .
he was right half the time , obviously .
it's a great scheme .
i think it's disgusting .
it's not dishonest .
half the time he was wrong .
so he refunded their money .
but even so .
what i find disgusting ... ... is being with one guy and thinking of another .
if you don't know what you're saying , keep quiet ,
mr. alfred .
you're thinking of emile .
that's just it , no .
how can i convince you that i love you?
got any change?
wanna hear a record?
which one?
itsy bitsy bikini "?
no .
