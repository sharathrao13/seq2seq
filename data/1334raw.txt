casey?
something wrong , mr. bast?
no , not at all .
i was curious if you'd started weighing college options .
options?
uh ...
heard of the helen stoller physics scholarship?
no .
it's given to a student from this state who shows most promise in science .
wouldn't that be ann or ...
wyatt?
no , it's you .
you have a calling , casey .
i do?
what is it?
physics .
toast?
uh ... sure .
you're very lucky .
most people search their whole lives for their calling .
how do you know you have a calling?
your brilliant teacher tells you .
and of course your 1 1 straight a pluses on exams is a hint .
you'll need a letter from me for the scholarship and think about a special physics project over the summer .
something unusual but personal .
let them know you a little .
he says it's my calling .
qed .
how is this " quite easily demonstrated "?
you're as good in physics as i am .
not even close .
i grind , you glide .
event horizon .
one day that guy will wake up and realize he needs a math tutor .
and that tutor will be me .
figure out how to get us invited to even one party and you win the nobel .
hey , you're casey , right?
uh huh .
here's an invite to my boyfriend's party .
wow .
you're in chem lab with julian wilson , right?
mm hm .
can you give that to him?
thanks .
that was way inconsiderate .
i love mr. bast .
lf he uncovered a scholarship i didn't know about , he's a genius .
and to think they pay him almost nothing .
the devaluation of teachers in our society , it just ...
it blows my mind .
mom .
i'm back .
sorry .
i have to figure out what he wants from me .
i mean , what is a personal science project?
lsn't the nature of science supposed to be completely unbiased and factual?
now he wants the inner me , too?
the whole secret of the study of nature lies in learning how to use one's eyes .
you know who said that?
i'm guessing it was a woman .
that was written by george sand , a woman forced to use a man's name because she couldn't get published .
mom .
okay .
anyway , i always tell my students ,
you'll know your topic when you learn how to use your eyes .
oh !
oh , no ...
she had it locked up .
i need to eat ice cream and all your mother has is leftover tofu .
can we go?
sh !
sh !
look at that recovery !
amazing .
she'll still place .
she's so precise .
i mean , down to the last ...
you know ...
i bet there is an exact aerodynamic formula .

# we are
# what everyone wants to be

# if you look
# life lays out just like a road
# it's for us to grab a hold

# we're alive

# doin 'fine #
what do you think you're doing?
l i'm ...
why are you filming skaters?
for a physics project .
you're scoping her triple loop .
why?
no , i'm analyzing her movement .
who are you working for?
nobody .
teddy , will you come over here?
i'm gonna call the cops .
no , i didn't think it would be a problem .
i thought this was a public rink ...
private practice only from six to ten .
these girls are training for the regional championships , which i think you perfectly well know .
no , i'm a student .
i have an ld .
i have a notebook .
whoa , yeah .
definitely spy code .
what are you doing here?
you know her?
she's a science geek .
look , i'm sorry , but when the c. l . a. wants to learn new dirty tricks , they observe skaters and their moms .
tina , can i have a word?
frank , not now .
i want to digitize some images into my computer to see if any kind of unified theory emerges .
okay , if gen knows you and you wanna press your nose up against the glass and take a few notes ,
i don't really care .
but you'll have a hard sell with the parents .
absolutely not .
but no one outside of the scholarship committee will ever see this program .
here's the letter from my teacher explaining the assignment .
and my driver's license .
um ...
i've also got some letters of references from people i baby sat for .
let's keep it moving , girls .
it's possible .
we'll have the team nikki legal team check this out .
beautiful , sweetie .
thanks , mom !
no talking to my daughter .
she's training .
no distraction .
not a word .
no .
look , i don't care if you're here .
lf you post me on the school website falling on my butt , you'd better transfer to another school .
okay , nikki .
let's try that again .
keep it moving .
a little wider , that's it .
hey !
no street shoes on the ice !
i'm sorry ...
sorry .
gen !
hello , hon .
gen !
gen !
brian , she's training .
you know the rules .
i brought her a burger , mrs. h. gen can't eat that .
come on , i'm burning tons of calories .
not enough .
a half hour?
not if you wanna win .
you should coach our basketball team .
we could use a kick in the butt .
lf you don't leave this instant , that's exactly what you'll get .
bye .
i do not want him coming here during practice .
but i never get to see him .
every other girl i know ...
you're not like the other girls .
winners make sacrifices .
maybe they just cheat .
turn that off !
sorry .
take it from the layback .
the conclusion's too simplistic .
the kinetic energy in a jump equals half the skater's mass times velocity squared , minus ...
no , i could barely understand it .
but ...?
i don't know if they'll care but it's just a little bit ... ... dry .
mr. bast said i have to make it personal .
how do i do that?
i don't know .
put more you in it .
oh , excuse me , tina .
ls there any way that i could take a few lessons?
i think i might be able to write better about the physics principles if i'm the one actually applying them .
lf there's any way i could ...
fine .
we're starting a novice class for the summer .
three afternoons a week . $800 . $800?
popcorn !
i want popcorn !
where are my gummi bears?
i gave them to you .
four hot dogs !
oh , i'm sorry ...
you touched that with your fingers .
oh , fine .
you don't want it?
i'll eat it .
oh , you breathed on it !
you shouldn't work here .
you're here again?
um ...
i'm working .
it's for my science project .
aren't you going overboard with this project?
no , i'm totally committed to it , like you're committed to skating .
whatever .
i'm starving .
b. l. t. here .
hold the b , heavy on the l.
um ... sure .
beef patty .
squish it till it's dry .
no bun .
salad for me .
coming up .
just iceberg lettuce , half a cup of garbanzos and a lemon wedge .
oh , and a quarter cup of cheese .
ooh , cheese !
it's saturday .
i can pig out if i want to .
i don't know what's wrong .
i'm popping my lutz .
it's all that cheese .
would you shut up?
i've gotta focus .
i heard zoey bloch's been sticking a quad .
that is a rumor .
which she probably started herself .
early in the season for stupid head games .
not for zoey .
food's ready !
that is way more than a quarter cup .
um ...
it's $1 . 65 , $2 . 35 and $3 . 35 .
that's $ 7 . 30 .
or if you split it the other way , it's $1 . 75 and $5 . 55 .
whoa .
you can keep it all if you just stop doing that .
you're welcome .
all right , everybody .
welcome to our snowplow sam class .
let's line up .
lookin 'good .
class , can you tell our assistant the most important rule for this class?
mom ...
never be late .
right .
we have a lot to do if we are going to be ready for our recital in august .
we are going to work on our toe loop .
our lutz .
but first , all of you have to get comfortable with throwing your bodies into the air .
casey , you're the physics whiz .
what's that rule about what goes up?
technically , it's that every particle attracts ...
casey .
must come down .
this ... is your new best friend .
oh !
oh ...
look , could you try not to , like , squish me?
i'm sorry .
casey .
pull your arms in tighter .
they're throwing you off balance .
arms in .
okay .
now try that about 5, 000 more times .
right .
push over on your right leg .
don't look at your feet .
look straight ahead .
jeremy !
that toe pick is there for a reason !
you dig it in .
or no friends over for a week .
this is a lot of pressure for a recital .
it's not only a recital .
it's a u. s. f. s. a. j. s. t.
earth speak , please?
it's the first step in qualifying for the regionals .
i mean for us kids .
oh .
you don't have to do it .
that's good .
because it's not humanly possible .
you set me free ]
# can't you see
# there's a feeling that's come over me
# close my eyes
# you're the only one that leaves me
# completely breathless
# no need to wonder why
# sometimes a gift like this you can't deny
# oh , 'cause i wanted to fly
# so you gave me your wings
# and time held its breath
# so i could see , yeah
# and you set me free #
are you out of your mind? !
hey , don't you know anything?
no skating when the zamboni's out .
i'm fine .
i'm fine .
thank you .
oh , you're fine?
okay .
i'm sorry .
look , you wanna tell me what was in your head?
i've never skated on such a smooth surface before .
i wanted to see what it was like .
lake skater?
pond .
near my house .
look , you need a hand .
no !
i'm good to go .
oh !
you must really want that a.
wow , that's a lot of styrofoam .
it's not for an a.
it's for a physics scholarship .
what , like , uh ... inertia and drag and velocity and all that?
how do you know about that?
i'm into cars .
get this baby out on the road , i can open her up to ... ... seven miles an hour .
blow the doors off any street sweeper in town .
um ...
i should get home .
yeah , you should .
can't do the ice until you're off .
right .
sure .
well ...
how's it coming?
it's coming .
it takes incredible training and effort and there's artistry involved but i'm sorry ,
i just can't get past the twinky little outfits .
mom , they're actually very aerodynamically sound .
it sets us back 50 years .
lf i ever saw you squeezed into one of those things , i'd probably start crying .
believe me , you never will .
will you get some sleep?
please?
hello .
this is my video presentation .
hi .
i'm casey carlyle .
cut a second .
i sound like a driver's ed movie .
relax .
do it like you're talking to me .
hey , there .
i'm casey .
oh , my god .
i forgot my last name .
can i start over?
hi .
i'm casey carlyle .
i decided to see if i could make myself prove my own hypothesis on the application of physics to the required elements of competitive figure skating .
now , i'm going to increase the centripetal force by tucking in my arms .
this will increase my moment of inertia , so i will spin ... ... faster .
i'll increase the height of my jump by applying more force to my toe pick .
you know , you look kinda hot .
shut up .
i'm gonna start off with a bad one .
for the before shot .
yeah , that pretty much blew .
okay .
now you're making me mad .
good .
when you sign with nike , remember i wear size six and a half .
i want to do the recital .
for science .
be here tonight , 5 : 30 .
okay .
mm !
tina ...
i have this harvard alumni tea thing at three .
then , what are we talking about?
no , it's okay .
i'll make it .
um ...
you have nothing to wear .
come by my house at noon .
maybe one of my old things will work for you .
wow .
okay .
what?
thanks !
sweetie?
just a second !
hold on !
almost ready?
uh huh .
i have a surprise for you .
that does it .
perfect .
i think the whole effect is very grown up , with a nod to femininity .
we've evolved past flaunting it , but we don't have to deny it .
i mean , you are going to be mingling with your future prospective classmates and professors , and i really wanted the look to say , " we are serious .
well , it definitely succeeds .
mom , we don't have to stay at this thing for more than an hour , right?
um , because ... there's something i have to tell you .
oh ...
oh , honey .
what was that?
i've been so worried .
you've been living at that rink , but you're here , now .
and you're excited , because you understand what's really important .
look , i've got goose bumps .
i'm sorry , that was so type a of me .
mom disease .
just relax .
just be yourself .
your normal , poised , charming , articulate ...
mom ...
do you wanna go over it one more time?
hi .
i'm casey carlyle , and i'm attracted to the physics program because ...
physics rocks .
ln sophomore year , you can join the quantum club and that rocks because we compete against cal tech , mlt and stanford .
last year , our ion particle accelerator took first place .
it rocked .
sounds really , um ... rockin '.
it is , it really is .
do you know what i think is great?
lf casey's scholarship works out ,
i'm sensing that you two will be spending scads of time together .
hors d'oeuvre?
oh , how wonderful , bruschetta .
lf you have some time right now ,
i'll take you through the entire physical sciences syilabus .
we have got nothing but time !
don't we , case?
great !
i know i'm late .
i'm sorry .
that's the first rule .
all right , let's get ready .
come on .
that's what she said ...
i have to do two turns ...
really?
yeah .
we're supposed to go round the side , remember?
oh ...
it's right there .
right there , is that better?
yeah ...
deep breath .
and then you let it out .
it didn't work .
come on .
okay , everybody .
i'll take that .
good luck .
thanks .
nice and slow .
lily , no talking .
hi .
it's oh so quiet ]

what's my score?
how did i do?
how did i do?
novice pass . " yes !
casey , how did you do?
fine , i guess .
it says ... " junior pass .
what?
you skipped two levels .
why didn't i skip two levels?
because you're six , lily .
junior level is where gen and nikki and tiff are at .
ls that true , tina?
that i'm on a junior level?
yes , it's true .
okay , everybody , let's get changed .
come on , everybody .
let's go .
so , if i ...
lf i wanted to compete?
you can't .
why not?
what happened was , the judges saw the same thing i've been seeing all summer .
you got some raw talent .
that's not enough for a shot at the regionals .
you need a coach , a valet , a choreographer , private ice time .
nikki's parents took out a second mortgage to do this .
and tiffany's dad works two jobs .
oh .
where d'you get those skates?
garage sale .
they're falling off your feet .
you need custom boots , $600 minimum , and the blades need to be sharpened every six weeks .
you get it?
i'm sorry .
it is what it is .
you have to want it .
you have to want it more than anything else .
it's not something you do on a whim .
you know what i was thinking , miss senior?
this is the last first day of school .
because the next first day , you'll be in a dorm .
so i went a little nuts .
i made pancakes with white flour .
can you believe summer's over?
we're wasting our lives here .
heard you landed a double .
tiff !
well?
that took me two years .
really?
so i guess we'll see you then?
no , you won't .
not at the rink .
i can't train with you guys .
why not?
um , i can't afford it .
oh !
yeah .
but , um , it's been fun .
look , casey .
i'll tell you something , all right .
you don't know how lucky you are .
for what?
to have a life .
you think i have a life?
i know you do .
you have tv time , and friend time ...
but you get to skate all you want .
more than i want .
i'd love to be you .
have a saturday night , see your boyfriend ...
yeah ...
eat what you want .
like bread .
buckets and buckets of bread .
oh , boo hoo hoo !
who cares?
who cares about all that stuff?
don't you just wanna skate all the time?
no .
no .
what's the matter with you people?
are you insane?
the jumping shrimp is a skating machine .
" the jumping shrimp "?
my mom copyrighted it .
see ya .
scary .
we must learn from her .
this is exactly what the scholarship committee is looking for .
your enthusiasm for the project just leaps off the page .
ln fact , it's so good , you could probably sell it .
thanks .
tiffany .
hey .
what if i told you i could fix your spread eagle?
would you like to learn how to stop traveling on your sit spin?
i don't !
well , maybe i do .
you could land your double axel .
clean .
fly ]
# i needed some wings to make it right
# i had to fly away
# i busted out and headed straight
# now i'm lovin 'life
# 'cause nothin 'can get in my way
# i'm the prettiest thing in the sky

and she's back !
how'd you score the rink time?
physics !
i'm trading my science project .
look , you carved up my nice smooth ice .
but , you know , it wasn't so hard watching you do it .
casey !
mom?
what are you doing here?
orthodontist .
new nightguard fitting .
remember?
here .
what's ...
what's going on here?
who's this?
uh ...
teddy .
right .
teddy .
teddy drives the zamboni .
teddy the zamboni driver .
i thought you were working on your project .
she was .
your daughter's very talented .
and ... and you are ...?
tina .
tina harwood?
yes .
the skater .
yes .
with all the trophies and the little outfits .
yes .
well , don't let me interrupt .
carry on with all your fun here .
thank you .
i will .
come on , mom .
yes .
yes , of course .
bye .
okay .
you need to keep your knees in tighter , point your foot , so you'll spin faster .
okay , easy enough .
get up ]
# i'm not afraid to fall
# it means i climbed up high
# to fall is not to fail
# you fail when you don't try
# not afraid to fall i might just ...
better?
perfect .
# if i get up i might fall back down again
# so let's get up , come on

# we get up anyway
# if i get up i might fall back down again
# so let's get up , come on
# if i get up i might fall back down again
# and i might fall back down again #
it worked !
just like you said it would .
the computer doesn't make the jumps .
that was all you .
come on , mom , just this one time .
i'll be back by eleven .
come on , mom , just this one time .
i'll be back by eleven .
you have a 5 : 30a . m . practice tomorrow .
think you're gonna be all sparkly for that if i let you stay out all hours?
mom , i landed my axel .
can't i just have one saturday night , please?
who are you going with?
hi , um ...
d'you wanna hang out tonight?
with you?
yeah , you know , get something to eat .
maybe do a movie or something .
um ... yeah .
but ...
here we are ...
this doesn't look like a movie .
gen !
gen !
gen !
gen !
i , um ...
i'm not dressed for a party .
shake it .
your hair .
now , no one will notice .
work the hair .
hi .
hi .
i don't know any of these people .
sure , you do .
they're all in your class .
there's ...
jason , football .
and luke , soccer .
i know them but i ...
i don't actually talk to them .
i don't talk to guys or ... people .
well , now would be the perfect time to start .
hey , kyle .
hey .
casey .
casey , kyle .
kyle plays hockey .
casey skates .
hey .
you guys have a lot in common .
have fun .
but ...
i ...
brian !
so you skate , huh?
figure , uh ... skate .
figure skate .
oh .
i wouldn't let the rest of the team hear this but you guys could probably skate circles around us .
but not pushing a puck .
why don't you come to our next game?
whoo hoo !
go !
go !
go !
uh oh .
what?
well , assuming his weight to be about 1 50lbs , at that rate of descent , his estimated trajectory would bring him ... ... directly through the window .
oooh !
i mean , it's a simple v times m equals a miscalculation .
you know , velocity times momentum equals acceleration .
physics .
yeah , i have to , um ...
yeah , later .
do you know who that was?
that was kyle dayton .
way hot .
word of advice .
don't ever speak again .
when i get nervous , i kind of babble a little .
it's like this gear gets loose in my head .
like those planck diagrams , where ...
you're doing that babbling thing again .
i think babbling is cool .
come on , casey .
thanks .
get your shine on ]
# get your , get your shine on get your , get your shine on
# too hot too hot ... #
so you're gen's cover tonight , huh?
it's usually my job .
she could've warned me we were going to a party .
you know , my sister has her own problems .
your sister?
yeah .
you're tina's son?
ls that so hard to believe?
no , no , wow , i just , um ...
i just thought ...
i was the help?
i mean , i kinda am .
gen skates and i fix stuff .
well , most stuff .
an object is only as strong as its weakest point .
physics .
thanks .
right , so ...
tell me about , um ... ... fixing stuff .
well , i mean the rink was a pit when my mom bought it .
mostly with her divorce money .
i helped bring it back .
i did the repair work , the painting ...
the zamboni .
that was my favorite part .
so , um , for you it's the science stuff?
um ... right .
sorry .
yeah , nice one !
klutz !

hi .
where have you been?
stayed late at school .
no , where have you been all week?
this tutoring thing has got me totally stretched out .
why are you doing this?
this kid is the dumbest ninth grader on the planet .
mom , it looks good on my application .
ann's doing it too .
ann was with you just now?
yeah .
five minutes ago .
ann just phoned for you .
what's going on?
nothing .
and since when do you get a c on a test?
i saw it in your room .
i was not snooping .
i mean , you and as are like peanut butter and jelly .
ls it belated rebellion?
what?
ls it ... ... a boy?
mom , no !
i'm sorry .
you do realize what is at stake with your grades right now?
i know .
i know .
i'm sorry .
i feel bad about the c , okay?
can you just give it a rest?
sweetie !
mom , i just want to compete at regionals .
why?
what do you have to gain by this?
i'm good .
so , what are you saying?
you wanna just blow off our whole plan for you , chuck the scholarship and become a professional athlete?
case , what is the shelf life on an ice skater?
eight years?
and then a few years touring with has beens on lce .
and that's it?
that's the end of your life?
i love it , mom .
case , there's no shelf life on your mind .
lf i'd learned to use mine a little sooner , if i'd gone to college when i was your age , maybe we wouldn't be living like this .
there's nothing wrong with the way we live .
i've not been able to give you a quarter of the things i've wanted to .
you've given me everything .
then you need to give me something now .
attention , skaters !
we will be playing classical music the entire ride .
oh , mom !
unless , of course , someone wins a trophy .
and then its outkast for you .
yeah !
and earplugs for me .
so , we're picking up a stray .
hey .
lsn't your mom coming?
she's not really into skating .
guess what?
slonski toyota sponsorship , it's a done deal .
we're way behind on marketing .
i'm working two jobs for you because you're worth it .
and you'll be even more worth it when you win .
trs harsh .
you think?
hey , watch this .
hey , nik .
everyone says you and i are gonna take first and second today .
nice try .
what was that about?
classic psych out .
softens up the competition so they don't go all out to win .
don't ever fall for it .
got it .
no matter what happens in the short program , even if you tank , just tell yourself it's only one third of the score .
never freak till after the long .
freak after the long .
okay .
hey , slowpoke !
you're coming too?
well , i don't have to if you don't want me to .
well , i guess if the van breaks down or something .
rock and roll ]
rock and roll ]
hey , that's zoey bloch , a. k. a. skate thief .
well , well .
lf it isn't the leaping dwarf .
it's the jumping shrimp , actually .
like that's a step up?
don't talk to her , nikki .
and don't get any closer .
you don't wanna lose your skates .
like i'd need to steal her skates to win this?
or a lame computer program?
how'd she know about that?
she's got eyes in the back of her horns .
beat it , harwood .
make me , bloch .
don't engage , gennifer .
you should know better than that .
zoey , come on .
lmagine you are in ...
a bubble .
i know , mom .
remember , don't ...
deviate from my program .
even if you do nothing but fall , it's not ...
even an option .
i know , mom .
look at me .
so you're the one trying to make it without a coach .
i just wanted to wish you luck .
it's not easy going out there your first time .
thanks .
you just gotta keep focused .
and be impressive .
set the groundwork for next year .
next year?
no way are you gonna place this year .
the judges have already ranked this thing in their minds .
nice skates .
hey , come on .
it's just another classic psych out .
it's the old , " you've already lost so why bother trying?
come on .
don't get offended .
just one little question .
what?
haven't you heard of eyeliner?
not yet .
casey !
stop .
not yet .
i really appreciate the effort , but i don't think there's a lot to work with .
i'm ...
you're hot .
but stay away from brian .
he's mine .
teddy ...
teddy you can have .
oh , um , but i don't ...
you know , i may not be as smart as you are , but i'm not an idiot .
ladies and gentlemen , welcome to the 54th annual
new england regional figure skating competition .
our first skater for the short program is zoey bloch from worcester , massachusetts .
can can ]
we love skating and we love gold !
yes !
okay , we're in .
definitely top four .
you're going to the sectionals !
unless sasha cohen makes a guest appearance .
good job .
good luck .
our final skater is casey carlyle from millbrook , connecticut .
some numbers ...

mom , she's got the crowd .
# quicker than a ray of light
# quicker than a ray of light [ crowd roars ]
did you know she had a triple?
she came to win .
she figured that out on her computer .
mom , the computer doesn't make the jumps for you .
# and i feel like i just got home
# and i feel
# and i feel like i just got home

number one !
yes !
yeah !
you crushed , baby !
it's only the short , shorty .
fourth .
we'll take it .
fifth , that's great !
yeah , but fifth doesn't go to sectionals .
skate a clean program tonight , you can move up .
knock me out of fourth .
casey , you almost lost a boot out there .
i know , it's giving out .
i think you'd better come with me .
how do they feel?
i really can't accept these .
just show me you deserve them .
and we'll need a pair of blades .
i'll have them sharpened for you right away .
tina , i can't believe that you would help ...
no fawning .
no .
just ...
thank you .
and the next performer in the junior ladies free skate is casey carlyle from millbrook , connecticut .
oh !
who is it?
and that's how it's done , dwarf .
shut up , pincushion .
come on , sweetie .
excuse me .
i'm going to sectionals !
good girl !
congratulations !
are those new?
yeah .
are you crazy?
you can't compete on new skates .
they take , like , a minimum of ten days to break in .
everybody knows that .
but tina didn't tell me .
you mean tina , whose robot daughter almost didn't make sectionals because of you?
typical tina harwood .
just like sarajevo .
you don't know anything , do you?
they kicked her out .
you might wanna reconsider that no coach thing .
bye , new girl .
meet at the van in 40 minutes .
okay , sure thing .
there she is .
congratulations .
thanks .
you were awesome .
i am so happy that it's over .
are you happy about my feet?
what?
i'm sorry , casey , but your old skates were a mess .
you bought her new skates?
please , like you didn't know .
casey , i didn't !
how can you lie to my face?
you're just as bad as she is .
hey , ease up , casey .
oh , just defend her !
like you weren't part of it .
how could you think that?
because it's true .
you set me up .
all of you .
what kind of people are you?
come on , let's go .
mom?
can you come and get me?
i'm at the skating rink at westerly .
i want to come home .
honey , get in the car .
just get in the car , honey .
how dare you?
just hang on , kids .
you think you can just waltz away after injuring my daughter?
it's joan , right?
pulling her away from her studies behind my back?
filling her head with a fantasy that she can skate and sabotaging her chances?
i did you a favor .
you didn't want this for casey and you're right .
she's not cut out for it .
ls she gifted?
i'll give her that .
but casey won't fight for it .
she's too polite to do what you have to .
to push past everyone and everything and just take it .
so that's the example you set for your daughter .
to lie and to sneak around and to cheat .
i made my daughter strong , and you made casey at home in a lecture hall .
and she'll do very well there .
so you see , we agree .
my daughter's brilliant and will succeed at whatever she does .
but she will do it the right way despite people like you trying to convince her otherwise .
casey !
i'm in shape .
i can keep up with you .
go away .
casey , i didn't know !
right !
where have you been?
you are aware you had practice half an hour ago?
yes , i'm aware .
and?
and i'm done .
done?
i'm quitting .
you've got to be kidding .
that's ridiculous .
no , i was ridiculous for putting myself through this for so long .
we both know i don't have the talent .
perseverance is nine tenths of mastering any sport .
do you know what i want?
no , you don't know what i want .
because you never cared .
lf you have any sense of self preservation , you'll scatter .
i'm listening .
i wanna stop missing school .
i like school .
you know , it's stupid and the band will probably be horrible , but i wanna go to the homecoming dance .
and i wanna go with brian .
i want to stop feeling an idiot for flunking math because i don't have time to learn it .
and i want ...
all right .
all right .
i can see maybe we've overdone it .
overdone it?
just a little .
casey's skates , mom .
we'll continue this discussion at home .
you heard the whole thing?
yeah .
are you okay?
it's your slot , casey .
lf i drop out , you're next .
you'll go to sectionals .
no .
thanks .
tomorrow's my harvard interview .
that's my slot .
that's what i should be doing .
you sure about that?
it's a nice little experiment .
how does a triple loop jump entitle you to a physics scholarship?
the proof of the experiment isn't in the mumbo jumbo of the calculations .
it's in the improvement in the skating of three junior champions .
i also applied the findings to my own skating and ...
... and actually managed to implement the experiment in a very rewarding and entirely personal way .
well , good , because passion is a key component of what we look for in students .
passion makes people go on to do exceptional things .
so , casey , why are you passionate about harvard?
dr. healey , my mom and i have been imagining harvard practically my whole life .
i can't believe i'm saying this , but what i need to be doing ,
i can't do here .
i'm sorry i've wasted your time .
i'm so sorry .
miss carlyle , we won't reschedule .
i know .
you can't do this , case .
you're giving up your dream .
no , mom , i'm giving up your dream .
i'm going after mine .
how did you know?
didn't think you'd give up .
which meant you'd be out here bumping it out .
teddy , i've been trying to find some way to apologize .
i've got some ideas about that .
medium smooth or glassy?
i can't have a conversation with anybody i haven't known since kindergarten , so how come i can do that in front of you?
because you let people see you when you skate .
but , casey , you can't win going it alone .
you're gonna need some help .
what do you want?
five minutes .
you owe me that much .
lf you're here for an apology , you won't get one .
i'm not here for an apology .
tell me what happened in sarajevo .
why didn't you win?
i had an unfortunate warm up before my short program .
i collided with another skater and she got hurt .
are you sorry?
look , i paid my dues .
i was suspended .
by the time they considered reinstating me , i was 26 and it was too late .
but there isn't a day goes by that i don't wish i could relive that moment and do it differently .
i want you to coach me for sectionals .
why on earth would i do that?
because you don't have a skater and i don't have a coach .
we're a perfect match .
i don't think you have what it takes .
tina , i have to do this .
i want this more than i've ever wanted anything .
i said no to harvard .
i will work harder than any skater you have ever trained .
and if i fail , i fail , but because i wasn't good enough , not because i didn't have the guts .
i want to know what i can do in this sport , and i'm going to find out .
the rink .
tomorrow , 5 : 30a . m . , and get a good night's sleep .
you're gonna need it .
that you'd even consider letting that woman back into your head !
i don't have to like her or trust her .
no , you just wanna spend all your time with her .
i'm not gonna turn into her .
she's already rubbed off on you .
that's not true .
where did this hair come from?
and the make up and shirt?
i did not buy you that shirt .
that has nothing to do with it .
i think you wanna be exactly like her , and if you happen to lie now and again , well , hey , at least you'll be glamorous .
you think this is about glamour?
it is a sport , mom .
it is a thrilling and beautiful sport .
are you sure it doesn't just make you feel beautiful?
so what if it does?
what is so horrible about that?
about feeling strong and graceful and beautiful for once in my life?
why are you jealous of her?
well , i guess no matter how old we get , the rest of us will still always hate the prom queen .
you know it'll always be the casey and mom show .
do l?
but if you could just come to the rink and see me .
don't ask me !
i can't !
come with me right now .
mom .
just come watch me skate , and then tell me that i should stop .
you know what , i have a class , all right?
welcome to espn at the eastern sectional junior ladies 'short program .
i have to say , from the practice sessions i've seen , these ladies are fired up .
that's right .
every skater has worked unbelievably hard to get here .
and every one of them is ready to compete .
so , are you a science geek too?
math geek .
really? lf i could pass math , maybe i could get into college .
do you tutor?
do you know any cute guys?
first up in the ladies 'short program is zoey bloch .
she skates all out all the time and this crowd is just rocking out .
tiffany is probably the most graceful skater in this competition , and she's definitely on today .
i thought chantal was showing signs of nerves earlier .
not any more .
she's in total command out there .
fans call her the jumping shrimp but remember that name because this little dynamo has been landing massive jumps .
can can ]
the word " newcomer " doesn't even begin to cover casey carlyle .
she's never performed in a skating competition until this season .
definitely one to keep your eye on .
the standings are
zoey bloch in first place , nikki fletcher in second , followed by chantal degroat and casey carlyle .
4 . 8s to 4 . 9s !
one 5 . 0 !
and one 4 . 6 .
oh , come on !
no " good job " or " way to go "?
at least i landed the jumps .
you're in the game , no more .
i'm not seeing much fluidity coming out of your jumps and that hurt you artistically .
remember ...
your next movement is always part of the previous one .
rub your feet for at least five minutes and drink lots of water .
you pulled it out , girl !
only the short .
it's only the short .
i lied .
you mess up the short , you can never win .
hey , did you work things out with your mum?
um , we've hardly spoken in two months .
i think i broke her heart .
we can trace that plot line from euripides through shakespeare crossing the pond to mark twain , finding contemporary echoes in john cheever or ... ... janet jackson .
don't you mean shirley jackson?
you've done your reading .
all right .
next week , i want an essay on your candidate for the " less is more feminist writer of the 20th century .
from new york city , new york , emma flanders .
from new york city , new york , emma flanders .
this is it .
you can lose the long program just sitting here if you don't prepare properly .
put these in .
why?
believe me , you don't wanna know .
lf they fall , you'll get cocky , if they bring the crowd to its feet , you'll feel pressure .
no one else exists .
go into the bubble .
toxic ]
forget it .
i just need to hear her voice .
you've reached the carlyles .
we're not here right now ...
it's not about her .
this is about you .
our final skater is casey carlyle from millbrook , connecticut .
one more thing .
what?
skate with your heart .
# all my life
# there was just me and my dreams
# and the days went ticking by like the beat of my heart
# spent my nights wondering how it would feel
# when the waiting would end and tomorrow would start
# suddenly i see a light
# out of the darkness i'm coming alive
# so this is how it feels reaching for heaven
and here's her opening jump , a triple salchow .
# like a phoenix rising from the flames
# i'm reaching for heaven
it's good for the nerves .
thanks . # all this time
# i never knew i was so strong
# a flame burning bright
# that was there all along
# in your eyes i can see all i can be
# suddenly i want it all
# i know you'll catch me if ever i fall
# so this is how it feels reaching for heaven
# and this is how it feels kissing the sky
triple loop .
perfect landing .
what?
she just threw in that triple lutz !
threw in's right , complete improvisation .
she deviated .
and i'll bust her for it .
tomorrow .
who said you could let go?
# it's my turn to show you
# this is how it feels
i haven't seen anyone come back this far from a disaster since midori lto in the '92 olympics .
that has to be the rally of the year .
# i'm reaching for heaven
# heaven # [ wild cheering ]
casey carlyle waits for marks .
nikki and zoey first and second in the ordinals , degroat third .
will that fall cost her , or will that rally , not to mention the added technical difficulty push her past the others?
high !
5 . 1 s and 5 . 2s .
they're almost dead even with nikki fletcher's .
that's my daughter .
that's my daughter .
here's her artistic set of marks .
hold on .
hold on .
those are almost even with nikki's .
did she do it?
no , it's not enough .
she'll have to settle for silver .
this takes her to nationals and who knows , maybe the 2006 olympics .
with this skater , anything is possible .
thank you .
case?
mom?
lf i'd known .
lf i'd just taken ten minutes and gone to the rink with you ,
i never would have ...
mom .
i'm sorry .
i'm so sorry .
how could i not see?
you see me better than anybody .
come on .
casey .
congratulations .
and you can drive the zamboni any time you want .
i was this close , this close to losing !
where did those triples come from? !
sweetheart , you ...
don't you know what'll happen after six months with tina?
what?
she's gonna whip my butt !
someone is gonna pay big time .
nikki .
can we have a word?
hello , peter .
just wanted to say congrats .
we look forward to seeing the jumping shrimp at the nationals .
that is so sweet .
i just went out there and skated my best .
and today , i guess my best was good enough .
love you .
you know i can't afford this .
we'll need to find a sponsor .
i'm on it .
burger blast is interested .
burger blast?
oh no , i am sorry .
i'm sorry , no .
why not?
lf she can't eat it , she can't endorse it .
we'll need something healthier .
how about grape nuts?
grape nuts?
what about cod liver oil?
guys .
you know , i am her mother .
what i say goes .
she is my daughter .
she is my skater .
well , daughter trumps skater .
well , ask any professional athlete , coach trumps mother every time .
guys !
and that boy , we'll need to nip that in the bud .
i can't go through all this and a boy too .
that is a huge distraction .
it's unacceptable .
i don't believe this !
you will be busy training .
and four college courses .
four?
are you out of your mind , with everything she's doing?
all right , two .
but then four in the fall .
only if she wins sectionals .
oh , she will .
