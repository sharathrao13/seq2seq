yes .
well , i'm sure we're not a match for the pros ... but we do have our own team .
southern division , semipros .
and we have a chance of winning the division this year , getting promotion .
we have been runnersup before ... but first is first and second is nowhere .
i want you to train the team .
use your professional experience .
well , i haven't played football for years and ...
i'm a little bit out of condition at the moment .
i pulled a lot of strings to get you assigned to my prison .
i'm sorry .
i'm just not your man .
we'll stick a pin in it for now .
out .
mr. burton , a quick word if i may .
sir?
i've spent a fortune on this team for no return .
i am the coach of this team .
with the amount of money ... that i've spent , we should have bloody won the world cup by now .
you cannot put a prisoner in charge of the guards 'team .

i just wanna keep my head down ... do my 12 months and i'm going home .
twelve months , yes .
but that's with parole .
and that's before you assaulted another inmate ... and attacked my staff .
wait a minute .
three years .
that's your sentence .
so you could be with us for some time .
hmm?
take him back to solitary .
psst .
have a nice week's holiday .
yeah , lovely .
there is a way out .
what?
listen .
convince the governor the best way to train the guards ... is to play a really tough match against a team of cons ... with you as the captain .
well , pros always have a preseason friendly .
well , what do you think , mr. burton?
could be winwin for everybody .
well , could this work , meehan?
yeah .
but i need time to prep .
and i get to pick my own team .
ooh , i could get a real f. a. ref .
there's one at my golf club .
that'd be good .
one more thing .
what goes on on the pitch , stays on the pitch .
deal?
goes without saying .
i am a marketing genius .
you better get yourself some rest , superstar .
busy day tomorrow .
we'll see .
oi , remember , anything you need .
i'm fine .
thanks .
yeah?
it's not what i heard .

i could have been a pro , you know .
i was good .
i was very good .
they were gonna take me on , only i had a bit of trouble and blah , blah .
the old knees , i suppose , yeah?
bomb making .
otherwise , you know .
well , i'm sure it was a big loss to the game .
i've gotta go , but i'll catch you later .
nitro .
dickhead .
yes , razzledazzle , came second .
what's the problem , darling?
well , that's not possible .
it's very possible , sweets .
that's not possible .
i think you owe me five g , darling .

so what happened to your marketing , mr. genius?
it's early days yet .
you gotta give it a little bit of time , dan .
oi , danny .
over here , mate .

now i can say i've had a kick about with danny the mean machine .
whoowhoo !
burning in me head !

it's all right .
i'll go and get it .
found a new bum chum , have we?
makes you feel big , does he?
he's just using you .
once he finds his feet in here , he'll dump you on your fat , black arse ... you jumpedup little shit .
mr. ratchett , sir , whilst i don't wish to be rude ...
i believe you watched too many tarzan films as an impressionable child .
don't you get fuckin 'smart with me .
you understand?
now get outta my sights .
what happened to you?
nothing .
sykes's boys look pretty useful .
don't even think about it .

what's three across?
what?
i just saw a bloke pay money for a strip of crossword .
ah , sykes .
yeah , three across , four letters ...
acid .
you see , the governor lets sykes get his racing times ... and other papers special delivery .
he thinks it helps sykes work out form ... and give him tips .
he doesn't know that they're presoaked in acid .
he's actually smuggling sykes's drugs in for him .
he came second , and it cost me 5, 000 pounds .
you must have made the wrong bet .
w " for win .
win .
it's got smudged in the rain .
ew .
ew " means to place .
it's a fuckin 'disgrace , if you ask me .
meehan fraternizing with that shower of shit .

i was thinking .

that fuckin 'meehan .
mr. burton , have you missed me?
you might be the governor's pet project , meehan , but don't push it .
it's called sunlight .
think of it as a privilege which can be withdrawn .
danny boy .
well , come on then , star .
they're saying thanks for saving massive .
where's your manners?
what would your old mum say?
fuck me .
wish i'd met her .
let's see how good you are .
sort yourselves out .
skins v. shirts .
what's that?
i'm your manager .

look , stop bitchin ', bitch .
dan , have a word .
shut it , massive .
oi , lads , want a game?

bollocks .
one , two ... three , four i don't know .
i wouldn't mind a crack at the guards .
i'm sorry .
i missed that .
just saying , be a laugh .
well , that's the scots all over , isn't it?
on the firm when it suits them ... and the next minute they're all mistyeyed and independent .
i was only saying and i'm saying no .
i think we're going to have to work on the stamina , lads .
i'll pay at the end of the month .
no , sweets .
it's cash on the nail .
well , i haven't got it .
well , sell the nice new saab then , love .
how'd you know about that?
pay us or we'll torch the motor .
you can pay us out of the insurance .
there you go , sorted .
i was told you were reasonable .
reasonable , sweetheart?
reasonable is how come you ain't sitting in a pool of your own piss ... wondering how to get up with smashed knees and elbows .
okay?
big kiss .
looking forward to getting a thrashing , meehan?
if it means getting out early , i'll take another beating from your mob .
who said anything about a beating?
i'm talking about the match .
come on .
i've seen your lot in action .
i don't run my ship like that .
are you making a complaint?
no .
lock it up !
oi .
what's the matter?
did you have a nice chat with your chum burton , eh?
ain't you got any hobbies?
you sleep with one eye open , son .
whatever .
hello , danny boy .
nitro .
i've been wondering , dan .
i think you need a manager .
the tactics and all that , well , i am the business .
massive's manager .
i know , but i'm better than him , because i had trials , didn't i?
so
we all had trials , mate .
that's why we're here .
fuck off .
fuck off !
football trials , yeah?
i could be the i could be the physio .
oh , no , no , wait there .
i could be the pharmacist .
get the lads all pepped up and all that business .
i don't think so , mate .
good job he likes you .
he blew up five people he didn't .
they're stupid , you know .
they won't even let me in their shitty squad or nothing like that .
i don't give a fuck about their fuckin 'squad !
do you understand me?
if you want out of this fuckin 'prison ... you gotta come up with something to spoil their little party .
otherwise , you're fucked .
okay , okay , okay , relax .
00 tomorrow morning .
ah , mr. burton .
thank you .
it's only a paper .
mmhmm .
one down , two words you're nicked .
do you know the penalty for possessing illegal substances in a prison?
search him .
what you looking at , freak?
you were grassed up .
eh?
that dodgy fuckin 'meehan is getting well pally with mr. burton .
i've seen 'em talking .
what are you doing , ketch?
no one likes a rat , danny boy .
what do you mean a rat , eh , chiv?
the big man's right .
we're gonna see what we can do about them beady eyes , eh?
fuck , you know it weren't me .
you know it's not me .
which one am i gonna burst?
you choose the left or the right .
for fuck's sake !
go on , pop it !
fucking hold him still !
hurry up , you scots bastard !
who you calling a scots bastard?
you , you twat !
i cut myself shaving .
nosebleed .
it's the altitude .
ooh , you wanna get that seen to .
right , that's a yellow card , gentlemen .
behave yourselves .
you wanna be more careful with this .
you could have had my eye out .
thanks , by the way .
you saved me a lot of grief back there .
sorry about that .
that's all right .
anyway , you need a few more players .
what about your lot over there?
don't think so .
not against sykes's lot .
not that some of them wouldn't be up for it .
what makes you bulletproof?
he's not ... but he's well friendly with one bloke that sykes is nervous about .
who?
the monk , man .
that dude is beyond mental .
and so are his pals on the outside .
sykes , he wants a smooth flow .
all he really cares about is profit .
what money?
what money?
you're a betting man .
we'll make a deal .
let your lads play .
win or lose ... you call the result , bet accordingly .
back to your fixing the match routine , right?
now , listen .
it's like this .
i'd never take a bet against england ... and i wouldn't bet the screws against the cons .
then we can play to win .
would you think about it?
yes , i'll think about it .
but right now , i'm thinking you're polluting my air .
now go away .
how'd it go?
it didn't .
here , dan .
dan
i've been thinking .
leave the thinking to me , billy .
yeah , yeah , of course , dan .
well , what it is , dan
i was wondering if
wondering what , billy?
can i be on the team?
the squad , billy .
you can be on the squad .
i won't let you down , danny .
you know that , don't you?
yes , the squad , yes !
come on !
well in , bill .
well done !
yeah , the squad , the squad !
well in .
yes , you told me they were reasonable .
they are reasonable , but they're businessmen .
you got me into this , and you can get me out .
i opened the door , you walked through it .
you've been making money ever since .
so why haven't you got it?
it is just a temporary cashflow problem .
the team is bleeding me dry .
well , get it sorted .
because this lot have got a bad habit of turning cashflow problems ... into bloodflow problems .
i used to do double this just for a warm up , you know .
anno domini , mate .
i used to be able to piss in one go ... and then forget about it for the rest of the morning .
you never did say how come it ain't done your nut in here being in so long .
only does your nut if you don't think you should be here .
look at me .
sweet old man , huh?
bit bumbly , full of jailblock wisdom .
cornerstone of the jail , put in with the foundations , right?
right .
i didn't get to be the oldest con for breakin 'windows .
villains spend their lives shitting themselves ... that other criminals are going to seize them .
so they get their retaliation in first and twice as nasty .
a bloke was comin 'after me .
so i ...
i went around to his digs and lobbed a grenade in the window .
left over after the war , you know .
army surplus .
i didn't know , but he had his little baby ... and his girl in there with him .
the house went up like a firecracker .
no one came out .
he barricaded the door with furniture in case i came around .
by the time they got in , the screamin 'had stopped .
thirteen months old .
learning to walk , apparently .
nothing i can do is ever gonna make up for that , is it?
you're on .
what's that , a joke?
i'm not famous for my sense of humor .
i know nitro's the grass , not you .
one thingyou fight one of my boys .
fight?
a little earner i stage now and then .
i can't be seen giving you a free ride .
fight who?
fight him .
soft as puppy shit , nick is .
i'm an exfootballer , charlie , not a boxer .
so?
kick him .
an eye for an eye , you bastard .
fucking eye for a fucking boo !
don't you do that again .
calm down , silly beggar .
you seem to be making more fucking enemies by the minute .
yeah?
well , i want out ... of this shithouse !
please !
please !
you're halfway home , son .
i'm taking you down to segregation now .
that's why i'm here .
yeah?
yeah .
just get me a transfer , mr. ratchett , sir , please .
please .
please .
silverino sands , yeah?
boom , boom , boom , boom .
i will do anything , mr. ratchett , sir .
i will do anything , mr. ratchett .
you owe me for this .
out .
now .
we have a small change of plan .
nick has come over all poorly ... so i had to bring on a substitute .
walk away , danny .
walk away .
mass , this is the only way we're gonna get these boys to play .
in the dirty brown corner , with a record of 350 ... all coming by the way of the big k o ... the heavyduty champion of the penal world ...
ketch , the black country bastard !
come on !
and in the other equally dirty brown corner , we have the challenger .
formerly known as " the mean machine .
danny " i've had more bloody backhanders than boris becker " ...
meehan !
gentlemen , it's alternate punches ... followed by one mug of fivestar prison cognac .
cheers .
no using your left hand .
no butting , biting ... spitting , poking or kissing , you .
it's show time !
first head to hit the table loses .
first punch to the challenger .
is he trying to kiss me or what?
keep your head off the table .
head up !
hey !
hey !
focus , danny .
wake up !
he fuckin 'he fuckin '
get the water on him .
straighten yourself up , danny .
concentrate .
focus , danny !
easy , easy , easy , easy .
by the way ...
i'm in here for assault and battery .
troj , water !
come on !
come on !
keep your head up .
keep your head up !
i'm in here for drunken assault .
yeah !
first up , i'd like to welcome mr. sykes's boys .
now watch this .
hey , all right !
nice , danny .
okay , if you wanna do that , join a circus .
it's no good to us .
what we need is 11 men to play as a team .
right?
right !
yes !
that's lovely , dan , that .
well in .
okay , positions .
now i play center midfield .
let's have all the midfield players behind me defenders to me left , strikers to me right .
come on , lads .
come on !
come on !
terrific .
let's move on .
that's good .
now pass it .
pass it , trojan !
pass it !
trojan , it's a team game !
pass to our team !
he's too greedy .
okay , fellas .
now the key to set pieces is concentration ... calculation , teamwork .
with corners , it's about movement ... drawing defenders out of position .
when it comes to defending ... it's about tackling ... finesse ... calculation .
now remember these simple rules and we're in with a chance .
any questions?
lovely story .
yeah .
we still need a goalkeeper .
somebody to boss the defense about .
well , there's one man i know who could boss our defno .
no .
fuck that .
that's not even worth thinking about .
who?
who?
no , you'll laugh your head off .
who?
the monk .
the monk?
can he play?
well , they say he could have turned pro before he turned mad .
how mad is he?
he's the scot that even scots fear .
what did he do?
something very dark up in glasgow .
i heard he ate hannibal the cannibal .
let me tell you something .
not even the pope could get him out of the special wing .
well , monk is in the highsecurity wing .
so do me a favor .
maybe i can help you with barry the bookie .
i'm listening .
bet the game , your guards to win .
price is right , we make a killing .
you pay off barry and have some left .
take the missus to malaga .
this is so illegal .
i think " criminal " is the word .
all right , big man .
sound .
danny meehan , he's all right .
know what i mean?
he's got a wee favor to ask you .
hello , mr. monk .
can you play football?
aye .
good .
would you like to play with us?
no .
we're playin 'the guards .
aye .
i'm with ya .

let's have a look .
let me have a look .
he did that on purpose .
no , he didn't .
yes , he did .
tell him tell him it was an accident .
all right , it was an accident .
get yourself off over the back there .
he said it was an accident .
you're not worried about the opposition , are you , mr. burton?
a team of life's losers , led by a man who can be bought and sold .
i don't think so .
not when the game's about character .
we'll give you a match .
you'll give us a game .
i doubt whether you can match us .
we'll see .
one !
two !
three !
look up !
pass it , pass it !
look up again !
well done .
nice and easy .
let the ball do the work .

come on , jerome .
come on !
go !
go !
one , two , three , four !
and left , and right .
and left , and right .
and left , and right .
and left , and right .
hurry it up there !
i told you two to keep the center tight !
i've also always told you to wear tieups on your socks .
now you , get over there and mark up .
and you , bugger off .
four !
five !
now listen , daniel .
i'm not putting you under pressure , right?
but i'm burning up phone cards ... taking bets from prisons up and down the country .
oh , no .
and despite what the governor thinks ...
i'm betting us to win .
so my arse is on the line .
and by my arse , i mean your arse .
okay , lads , need a volunteer .
yep , dan .
dan .
yeah , all right , bill .
give monk and chiv a hand with their demonstration .
lovely .
cheers , danny .
aye , right , so , we are the cons ... and they are the screws .
so if anybody's gonna play dirty , it's gonna be they fuckers .
so here's one or two wee examples , just to keep us a step ahead .
know what i mean?
numero uno
the accidental tread on the toe .
it's an obvious one , but it works .
aw , fuck !
numero two
right , daftie .
run towards the monk .
what now?
yeah?
on you go , half pace .
the cunningly titled " elbow in the face . " very , very effective .
but you do tend to get sent off , so if you're gonna use it ... make sure the ref's not looking .
number four .
hold up .
hold up .
what happened to number three?
when you're helping them up ... grab the hairs under his armpits and twist them round .
hurts like a bastard , doesn't it?
yeah .
number five .
wait .
i'm gonna have a sitdown .
i don't want to hog it .
let one of these have a go .
you're all right , bill .
you're the man .
you're hard .
get in there .
yeah , as it happens , yeah .
no , go on , yeah .
and finally , the piece de resistance .
number 23 .
i can't .
monk , stop .
i'm in a bad way , mate .
monk , i can't breathe !
oh , fuck !
the guillotine .
come on then .
let's move on .
get yourself up .
you're making the place look untidy .
was that all right , though , dan?
cream .
well done , lads .
finish with a bit of shooting practice .
troj , you come out and lay them off .
massive , marks out of ten .
you done well with that lot .
passes the time , doc .
you know , it's not a crime to admit enjoying it .
you're becoming a sentimental old fart , ain't you?
go on , troj , hit it !
that bloody meehan .
who does he think he is , eh?
don't you worry about meehan .
i've got something sorted for him .
mr. popular , time to meet your friends .
you can't put me back on the wing , sir .
you scratch my back ...
sykes will fuckin 'kill me .
i'll scratch yours .
sykes will kill me .
you know the itch i want scratching .
i don't want meehan on that pitch .
you understand?
okay .
i know what needs to be done .
nice and easy .
right down the middle .
and aone ...
and atwo .
good shot .
good shot .
where you been?
the governor's been waiting .
it's the end of your shift .
i'll take him straight in .
okay , miss .
i've thought of a way i can really help you .
the sad old twat videos all their games .
really?
and i've written some pointers .
my own little dossier on the guards , like funny habits and that .
i'm sure you'll find it interesting .
now can you hurry up?
we haven't got much time .
quicker !
one thing .
what?
this is strictly sex .
i ain't gonna respect you after .
i don't blame you .
girls like to brag at the pub as well .
i've heard .
what?
what?
easy .
change your oil , did you?
gentlemen should never kiss and tell , massive .
you know that .
i think i'd better go home .
massive , inside information on the opposition .
read it careful .
it's really important .
all right , danny .
there's a meeting now in mr. sykes's cell .
all right , lads , a bit of windup material on the opposition .
ketch , this one's for you .
you know old ratchett keeps going on about his dodgy knee .
well , it's the right one .
this one is dynamite .
marsden's daughter donna ... has been known to dabble in quite a few different class a drugs .
let him know about it at the right time .
here we go , danny boy .
danny boy .
and now for our secret weapon .
danny , tape .
oh , shit .
i forgot it .
left it in me locker .
ah , yeah , i need a piss anyway .
cheers , doc .
sorry , boys .
that's all right .
get the old boy working .
danny , why did you do it?
throw that game .
fuck me , jerome .
you do talk too much .
sorry .
no , you're all right .
it's funny ... but when you're in that football world ... you just don't realize what it means to people .
and you only find out how disappointed they are when you let them down .
i was 16 when i signed pro forms .
thought i was the business .
didn't take long for standards to start slipping .
cars , booze , bad tips for slow horses .
you think you can handle it , then bang very soon it's handling you .
before i was picking up trophies ...
i was 425 grand down ... to men nasty enough to
well , they even would have put the wind up mr. sykes .
but they did give me two choices a wheelchair for life ... or a deliberate penalty against the germans .
it's not as if i've prospered .
look where i've ended up .
but i'll tell you something
i didn't start off as a youngster looking to sell me country out .
none of us planned to be here , mate .
you're a hero in scotland .
sign it , and i'll ship you straight out of here .
okay .
you know , even down here it ain't safe from sykes .
he's put a price on your head , sunshine .
killing doc was a big mistake .
fuck him .
where am i off to , boys?
the hmp silver sands , where all the rich go?
not exactly .
no .
no?
no .
you're gonna catch the ghost train out of here ... to the funny farm .
the funny farm .
her majesty's prison broadhurst .
what?
i'm gonna get you !
yeah !
i'll find your house !
i'm gonna blow it up !
no , you won't !
by the time the orderlies are finished with you ... you won't be able to blow your fucking nose !
let me out !
i'm gonna get you !
i reckon you're quits now , old man .
no , don't don't you worry about the car .
i'd have my bloody house on this one .
done deal , darling .
yes .
wanker .
okay , gentlemen .
you've got 90 minutes ... to show them that when it comes to physical and mental strength ... they can't touch us .
most of them are gonna want to mix it up out there .
don't get involved .
all right , lads .
you wanna be nothing ... numbers , prisoners , that's fine .
if you win out there today , you'll have something to remember forever .
you'll talk about it over and over .
'cause up and down the country cons are sick about not being here today ... just to have one crack at those bastards next door .
let's win , and let's win well .
lose , and they'll never let you forget it .
run your guts out , you'll have something here they can never touch .
no parole boards , judges ... or nutcase governors .
they've got one good player .
but he's had his moment , and this is a team game .
now , ask yourselves one question .
are you ready?
yes .
are we?
yes !
well , come on !
so i'm lookin 'at each and every one of you lads ... to get out there and show them who's boss !
come on !
hold up for mr. sykes .
doc was a different generation .
and he saved all his life .
but before he died , he had me sort out these .
come and get 'em , mates !
good afternoon .
i'm bob likely .
you join us live from the recreation field .
yes , i'm bob carter .
and thanks once again to our esteemed governor wanker for providing the splendid facilities that are here ... as part of his progressive rehabilitation campaign .
for our audience who are cooped up inside , here's a weather report .
it's a beautiful day , bob .
and what a day it is .
and the waiting's over .
yes , the guards are out first ... fronted by mr. burton .
and here comes the mean machine , led out ... by our most famous son , danny meehan .
don't worry .
the boys are up for it .
i'm not worried .
where'd they get those uniforms?
cheeky bastards .
mean machine !
mean machine !
skip .
skip .
your call .
heads .
heads we are , then .
okay .
this is the one .
take your chances .
don't start anything .
if they do , finish it , okay?
yeah !
come on , then !
simple ball every time , eh?
boy , mr. sykes , you look the part .
all you need now is a
here we go , bob .
it's the big one we've all been waiting for .
longmarsh prison guards versus longmarsh prison cons .
it's the cons to kick off .
ref !
a free kick to the cons .
ketch has just floored mr. ratchett .
what's the matter with you?
shut up , you pussy .
ow !
you fat bastard !
ow !
you fat bastard !
well done , ketch .
just be subtle .
which one's he , then?
come on .
take him out , son !
and trojan evades marsden brilliantly .
if only he could have done that the night he got nicked .
keeper plays it long .
walker brings it down to the halfway line .
and it's a misplaced pass to jerome mcfife .
but the everobservant mr. burton kicks it back to the guards .
it's a neat onetwo .
walker to burton .
back to walker .
he shoots .
ooh !
just past the post .
almost .
and that was too close for comfort .
too fucking close for my liking , bob .
get up there !
monk plays it out to danny meehan .
meehan has it in the center .
goes forward unchallenged .
it's a onetwo .
and burton has taken meehan's legs away .
and meehan does not look happy .
that's it , burton !
now , what's the matter with the rest of you , eh?
you four stand there .
split on my run .
i want to try something .
meehan to take it .
looks like he might chip this one , bob .
right at ratchett's crown jewels .
it'll take more than a magic sponge to take the sting out of that .
fuck me .
for christ's sake , ref , that was bloody deliberate .
free kick .
and ball .
protect yourself at all times .
you what?
ten yards !
ten !
come away !
right in his carrots and onions .
no nookie for mr. ratchett .
no nookie for mrs. ratchett neither .
play on !
just goes to show , bob , lightning can strike twice .
absofuckin'lutely , bob .
23 minutes of the first half to go and it's getting heated out there .
oh , yeah , bob .
very rock and roll .
fuckin 'hell .
he's got to get back in goal .
well , i ain't tellin 'him .
piss off , you scotch bastard .
how's your daughter , by the way?
donna?
still hanging about street corners and that to feed the habit?
what's up with ya?
for christ's sake !
that's it , fellas !
good teamwork !
that is a hard but a fair tackle , bob .
yeah , it was a fair challenge .
but that wasn't .
oh , and this could be dangerous for the cons , bob .
a free kick here .
you're back in afterwards .
don't think i didn't see it .
ketch has took his drop .
the guards look determined to convert this .
make it count !
get him !
the monk's collected it cleanly .
the monkcalm and calculated .
looks like the therapy's paying off .
and once again , monk's played it out to trojan ... who's again switched to the left .
he must be ambidextrous .
i don't know about that , but he sure can use both feet .
goal !
goal !
yeah !
beauty !
you beauty !
go on , my son !
go on , my son !
we're all over 'em .
onenil , to the mean machine .
it's the guards to kick off .
it's getting tough out there , bob .
you can say that again , bob .
it's getting tough out there , bob .
never mind , bob .
oh , no , bob .
it looks like the monk's at it again .
pass it !
do that again , i'll rip your head off .
ref , did you hear that?
i'm not worried .
he said it to you , not me .
let's go , sonny .
what is he doing?
don't ask me .
you're the skipper .
you tell him .
bollocks .
hold on .
oi !
you great fucker !
ooh , it's kicked off .
let's just try and keep calm .
referee !
go on !
get in there !
go on !
chin him !
this isn't a football match !
do him !
do him !
go on !
this is bollocks .
hey .
come on .
hit him !
fuck you !
this is bollocks !
what the fuck's going on here?
where the fuck are you , referee?
excuse me .
sorry .
calm down , everybody !
come on !
ref , how long?
bollocks .
that'll do .
halftime .
come on .
one nil , to the mean machine one nil
and what do you think you're doing?
you're supposed to throw this game .
yeah .
the boys don't seem to be taking much notice of me .
youthful exuberance .
shame .
would have worked out nice .
that's halftime .
what do you think meehan will be saying to the boys?
he'd be telling them that there's only 45 minutes left to play .
yeah .
well done .
well done .
settle down , boys .
have a listen .
we ain't won nothing yet .
all we got is one goal .
now , this half is when we're gonna earn it .
midfield , tuck in .
get round behind the ball .
monk
good work , monk .
just don't leave us exposed at the back , all right?
mouse it's me nose .
bill , you come on for mouse .
where am i playing?
take his place .
come midfield with me .
frenchy , have a look at his nose .
okay , lads , we've botched it , but we're onenil down .
mr. hayter , when the overlap comes you think about it .
we're getting beaten by a bunch of worthless criminals .
i'm doing my halftime talk , sir .
you sit down .
have you forgotten who they are?
they're the dregs of society and they're in the next dressing room ... and they're laughing at you right now .
every man here is playing for his job .
including you .
you wanted to see me?
yes .
what the hell's going on?
you wanted a game .
yes , but you never said anything about winning .
i never said nothing about losing either .
before leaving us , nitro wrote a confession .
he admitted to killing doc .
said you knew about it , and that you sent doc to your cell .
now , that's accessory to murder .
and that's 20 years .
you'll never get that to stick .
one whiff of this ... will kill you with the parole board .
oh , you could be with us for some time .
so i think it's in everyone's interest ... if you lose this game .
i can't do that .
well , you've done it before .
you had everything they ever dreamed of ... and you threw it all away .
meehan !
meehan has given it away again .
fuck sake , danny .
i was open .
i didn't see you .
looks like he's in a fuckin 'world of his own .
wake up , meehan !
the ball's played to the left .
hibert picks it up ... and moves forward to the edge of the 18yard box .
the defender cuts inside .
he plays it neatly to hayter , who knocks it for downes .
oh , no !
he's been brought down in the area .
could be a penalty .
the ref's waved play on and
oh , no , bob .
what goes through monk's head?
scary thought , bob .
yeah , i'd hate to think about what he dreams about .
it's getting a bit naughty out there , bob .
positively brutal .
don't know whether they're fighting or doing a tango .
no , they're definitely fighting .
billy the limpet , bless him .
he's chasing the ball like a little terrier .
shame he hasn't the skill to match his enthusiasm .
shame he's fuckin 'useless , bob .
absofuckin'lutely , bob .
ratchett's taken out cigs .
the guards are taking no prisoners .
you get it , bob?
whatever , bob .
you fucking watch it .
no , you fucking watch it , you fat bastard .
that's going a bit too far , isn't it?
he took a dive !
number seven .
violent conduct .
off the park .
it was a dive !
look !
come on .
do one , now .
fuck off .
it's a straight red .
the cons are down to ten men .
well , it's an early bath for raj ... which is really gonna put pressure on the mean machine .
it's disappointing , but you can be sure it's not going to be easy out there .
that's right , bob .
they're taking full advantage of the extra man on the pitch .
walker's through ball to mr. gayle , who plays it .
and hayter .
and monk !
superb save , way down to his left .
all right !
all right !
29 minutes , bob .
still onenil .
and the cons are holding out .
the monk's gone on another walkabout !
but this time he plays it safe to trojan out wide .
all troj has to do is look up .
come on .
pass it .
pass it .
pass .
pass it .
pass it .
pass it .
pass it !
pass the fucking ball !
yeah !
goal !
two nil to the cons .
ten men down , their liberty taken away from them ...
locked in a cell for 23 hours a day ... and today our boys have their day .
what's up with you?
for the last hour of my life sentence ...
i have been free !
mean machine !
mean machine !
mean machine !
mean machine !
yes !
it's the guards to kick off .
mr. williams lays it back for mr. hibert ... who whips a beautiful ball into the box .
monk's got it covered .
safe as houses .
oh , you've gotta love the monk .
gotta love the monk .
what's monk doing?
he's left an empty net !
he's lost the fuckin 'ball !
he's lost the fuckin 'plot .
guards 'goal .
twoone .
yes !
hey !
stop fucking about back here !
get the ball up the park !
all right .
my fault .
it's no longer just a game out there .
there's a match on now .
have a word , dan .
fuck off , trojan .
come on , lads .
let's go .
come on , boys .
the cons kick off .
but what is he doing?
he's given it straight away .
oh !
he's hit the bar !
you see?
there's no cohesion .
there's no character , eh?
the mean machine really need their star player ... to pick up his game now .
what is meehan doing , anyway?
it's like he's not even on the pitch .
what's up with you?
i never touched you .
looks like danny's injured .
you're cheating now , are you?
once a loser , always a loser .
what happened?
where'd you get hit?
down there .
doesn't look too clever , boys .
i can't see anything .
come on .
let's get him up .
all right , ref .
come on , danny .
don't put no weight on it .
looks like meehan is leaving the pitch .
lets hope they bring a sub on .
it's 11 against 9 out there .
frenchy , i've got it .
get it fixed .
okay , mr. sykes .
we got it .
shove up and shut up .
the guards are really moving the ball about nicely .
oh .
neat passing .
but the cons are determined not to give up .
there's nothing wrong with that leg , is there?
why don't people just let me play this game?
didn't think you'd sell us out .
not after the big " it's your time " speech .
is there something i should know?
he's fucked something up .
could be a strain .
it's getting tough out there .
the guards are putting the pressure on .
fuckin 'hell , massive !
help us out !
we've only got nine men on !
get a sub on !
walker to marsden .
downes wide to hibert .
hibert clips it forward .
walker brings it down .
the cons are swamped at the back .
ratchett's free in the area .
yes !
yes !
twofuckingtwo .
good one .
good one .
thanks , danny meehan .
come on , lads .
twotwo .
right .
now a third .
get up there .
ref !
sub !
mass , look it's your life .
ratchett just brought down billy the limpet .
that's like kicking a puppy dog , bob .
give me my boot .
yes !
ref !
ref !
i'm coming back on .
sit the fuck down , man .
forget it , meehan .
who's coming on?
me .
him .
you're playing like crap and you know it .
will you make up your mind?
who's in charge here?
i'm in charge .
i'm the manager .
danny's coming on .
hold it !
listen , i'm the owner .
you?
yes .
the owner?
yes .
behave .
manager's decision .
you .
on .
the great danny meehan returns to the pitch .
yeah .
that's all we fuckin 'need .
if he carries on playing like he did before he went off ... we may as well all go home now , bob .
ketch knocks it out wide to trojan .
it's amazing .
the guards are still finding it hard to deal with this man .
i'm with you here if you want !
yes , troj !
troj , pass it !
i'm on !
pass here !
trojan plays it into the center .
i'm free there .
yeah , well ...
i didn't fucking see you , did i?
oh , really .
chiv !
chiv , lay off !
pass it !
chiv , pass it !
pass
god , that was a meeting of minds .
not a pretty sight .
it looks like danny meehan's trying to redeem himself .
he's gonna have to do a fuck lot of work to manage that , bob .
danny meehan is now everywhere .
he's bobbing and weaving , bob .
no way was that offside !
that's the way it's done , pal .
the ball's pushed high into the guards 'half .
cigs pulls it down .
shoots .
oh , it's a goal !
the mean machine are out in front again !
there's a flag .
god bless the mean machine .
keep your shirt on .
something's up .
there's something going on , bob .
the mean machine are celebrating .
i think it's been disallowed .
the ref has gone to the linesman .
there's confusion on the pitch .
there certainly is , bob .
they're conferring .
oh , surely not !
yeah , yeah .
if this stands ... it's a free kick to the guards 35 yards out from the goal .
get up , you bloody tart !
aah !
easy .
okay .
let's get him off .
it's in a goalscoring position if i've ever seen one , bob .
we're in the dying seconds of the game .
it's twotwo .
lee , get changed .
you're on , mate .
ref !
mr. ratchett , are you all right , sir?
obviously not .
all right .
take him away .
are you gonna do absolutely nothing about that?
it's a free kick .
now take it .
how long , ref?
just moving into injury time .
this is it .
if he scores now , it's all over .
all right , gaylie .
stick it in .
and prison warder mr. gayle will take it .
he curls it .
heading to the top righthand corner !
guards of pentonville , guards of wandsworth
walton nick in liverpool policemen of britain
traffic wardens parole officers , wheelclampers ... your boys have taken a hell of a beating today !
a hell of a beating !
mean machine !
mean machine !
mean machine !
mean machine !
mean machine !
mean machine !
burning me head out !
burning me head out !

told you i wouldn't let you down .
well done , bill .
ruin my life , i'm gonna fucking ruin your life .

you're not stitching anyone up .
not on my watch .
what are you gonna do about it?
your job , your pension
my ass .
good game .

what was that?
looks like your saab .
and what he said goes for me and all .
and barry the bookie too .
