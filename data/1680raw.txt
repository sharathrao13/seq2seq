welcome to gattaca .
you keep your workstation so clean , jerome .
it's next to godliness , isn't that what they say?
godliness . . .
i reviewed your flight plan .
not one error in a million keystrokes .
phenomenal .
it's right that someone like you is taking us to titan .
has the committee approved the mission?
there's been talk of delay .
you shouldn't listen to talk .
you leave in a week .
you've got a substance test .
jerome .
never shy .
pisses on command .
a beautiful piece of equipment there , jerome .
have i ever told you that?
only every time i'm in here .
occupational hazard .
i see a great many on the course of any given day .
yours just happens to be an exceptional example .
i wonder why my folks didn't order one like that for me?
by the way , have i ever told you about my son?
no , you haven't .
remind me to , sometime .
so you're about to go up .
one week left .
please tell me you're the least bit excited .
i'll tell you at the end of the week .
congratulations , jerome .
thank you .
how many launches are there in a day?
a dozen?
sometimes more .
you're the only one that watches every one of them .
if you're going to pretend like you don't care , don't look up .
the most unremarkable of events .
jerome morrow , navigator 1st class , is about to embark
on a one year manned mission to titan , the 14th moon of saturn .
a highly prestigious assignment , although for jerome selection was virtually guaranteed at birth .
he's blessed with all the gifts required for such an undertaking .
a genetic quotient second to none .
no , there's truly nothing remarkable about the progress of jerome morrow .
except that i am not jerome morrow .
i was conceived in the riviera .
not the french riviera .
the detroit variety .
they used to say that a child conceived in love has a greater chance of happiness .
they don't say that any more .
i'll never understand what posessed my mother to put her faith in god's hands
rather than those of her local geneticist .
ten fingers , ten toes , that's all that used to matter ...
not now .
now , only seconds old , the exact time and cause of my death was already known .
neurological condition , 60 % probability , manic depression , 42 % probability .
attention deficit disorder , 89 % probability .
heart disorder . . .
. . .
99 % probability .
early fatal potential .
30 . 2 years .
30 years?
the name for the certificate?
anton .
no , vincent anton .
that's a good name .
i know he'll do something .
you'll do something .
from an early age i came to think of myself as others thought of me .
chronically ill .
every skinned knee and runny nose was treated as if it were life threatening .
i'm sorry , the insurance won't cover it .
if he fell . . .
but i was told ...
i really wish there were smth i could do .
like most other parents of their day , they were determined that their next child
will be brought into the world in what has become the natural way .
your extracted eggs , marie ,
have been fertilized with antonio's sperm .
after screening , we're left , as you see , with 2 healthy boys and 2 very healthy girls .
naturally no critical predispositions to any major inheritable diseases .
all that remains is to select the most compatible candidate .
first , you may want us to decide on a gender .
have you given it any thought?
we would want vincent to have a brother , you know , to play with .
of course you would .
hello vincent !
you have specified hazel eyes , dark hair and . . . fair skin .
premature baldness , miopia , alcoholism , addictiveness to susceptibility ,
propensity for violence , obesity ...
we didn't want . . .
i mean , diseases , yes , but . . .
we were just wandering if it's good to just leave a few things to chance .
we want to give your child the best possible start .
believe me , we have enough imperfection built in already .
your child doesn't need any additional burdens .
and keep in mind , this child is still you .
simply the best of you .
you could conceive naturally a 1 , 000 times and never get such a result .
that's how my brother anton came into the world .
a son my father considered worthy of his name .
i'm proud of you , son .
what'd i tell you .
see how much he's grown?
by the time we were playing at blood brothers
i understood that there was smth very different flowing through my veins .
and i'd need an awful lot more than a drop if i was going to get anywhere .
our favourite game was chicken .
when our parents weren't watching
we used to swim as far out as we dared .
it was about who'd get scared and turn back first .
come on , you coward !
of course it was always me .
anton was by far the stronger swimmer and he had no excuse to fail .
300 million , 350 million , 400 million .
maybe it was the love of the planets , maybe it was just my growing dislike for this one ,
but for as long as i can remember i've dreamed of going into space .
750 million , 800 million , 850 million .
how many astronauts are there anyway?
i bet i could be one if i wanted .
hey don't eat that .
it's pluto .
my goals didn't change a lot in the intervening years .
much to my parents 'dismay .
vincent . . .
you have to be realistic .
with a heart condition like yours . . .
mom , there's a chance there's nothing even wrong about it .
one chance in a 100 .
well , i'll take it , allright?
the trouble is they won't .
listen , for god's sake , you've got to understand something .
the only way that you'll see the inside of a spaceship is if you were cleaning it .
my father was right .
it didn't matter how much i lied on my resum .
my real resum was in my cells .
why should anybody invest all that money to train me
when there are a 1, 000 other applicants with a far cleaner profile?
of course , it's illegal to discriminate .
genoism " , it's called .
but no one takes the law seriously .
if you refuse to disclose , they can always take a sample from a door handle
or a handshake .
even the saliva on your application form .
if in doubt , a legal drug test can just as easily become
an illegal peek at your future in the company .
you're sure you wanna do this?
you know you're gonna lose .
it was the last time we swam together .
out into the open sea .
like always , knowing each stroke to the horizon was one we'd have to make back to the shore .
but something was very different about that day .
everytime anton tried to pull away
he found me right beside him .
until finally ... the impossible happened .
vincent !
it was the one moment in our lives that my brother was not as strong as he believed
and i was not as weak .
it was the moment that made everything else possible .
like many others in my situation
i moved around a lot next few years , getting work where i could .
i must've cleaned half the toilets in the state .
i belonged to a new underclass ,
no longer determined by social status or the colour of your skin .
welcome to gattaca , gentlemen .
now , we now have discrimination downto a science .
allright , there's your cleaning material .
start from the front and clean all the way back .
and i want to see my smiling face on that floor .
what about you , your majesty?
dreaming of space?
come here .
start by cleaning this space right here .
i was never more certain of how far away i was from my goal
then when i was standing right beside it .
when you clean the glass , vincent , don't clean it too well .
what do you mean?
you might get ideas .
yeah , but if the glass is clean ,
it'll be easier for you to see me when i'm on the other side of it .
poor my brave talk .
i knew it was just that .
no matter how much i trained or how much i studied ,
the best test score in the world wasn't gonna matter unless i had a blood test to go with it .
i've made up my mind to resort to more extreme measures .
the man who showed up at my doorstep didn't exactly advertise in the yellow pages .
stand straight .
how did you hear about me?
people .
any distinguishing marks?
tattoos , scars , birth marks?
no .
i don't think so .
are you serious about this?
i hope you're not wasting my time .
i'd give 100 % .
that'll get you halfway there .
that's an old edition , but i know it all by heart .
you realise the commitment is binding .
you have somebody in mind?
for the genetically superior , success is easier to attain , but is by no means not guaranteed .
after all , there is no gene for fate .
and when for one reason or another , a member of the elite falls on hard times
their genetic identity becomes a valued commodity for the unscrupulous .
one man's loss is another's gain .
his credentials are impeccable .
an expiration date you wouldn't believe .
the guy's practically gonna live forever .
he's got an iq off the register .
better than 20/ 20 in both eyes .
and the heart of an ox .
he could run through a wall .
if he could still run .
actually , he was a big time swimming star .
vincent , you could go anywhere with this guy's dna tucked under your arm .
what did i tell you , you look so right together i wanna double my fee .
we don't look anything alike .
it's close enough .
when was the last time anybody looked at your photograph?
you could have my face on your name tag , for christ 'sake .
but how do i explain the accident?
that's the beautiful thing , it happened out of the country .
there's no record he ever broke his back .
as far as anybody's concerned , he's still a walkin 'talkin 'fully productive member of society .
you just have to get him clean , fill in the last year of his life .
you're a foreigner .
they don't care where you were born .
just how .
blood has no nationality .
as long as it's got what they're looking for , it's the only passport you'll need .
who lives up there?
well , i certainly don't .
so began the process of becoming jerome .
myopia is one of the most obvious signs of a disadvantaged birth .
isn't there any other way?
surgery is no good , they'll see the scars .
it's contact lenses or a white cane .
besides , the colour doesn't match .
he's right .
my eyes are prettier .
you understand i take 25 % of everything you make .
if it for some reason it doesn't work out , all this equipment must be returned within 7 days .
and you don't get your deposit back .
wait , wait !
i thought you said 20 % .
it's only 5 % .
20 % .
it's not negotiable .
i guess that's it .
not quite .
why , why?
there's still the matter of the height .
why , how tall are you?
4 foot 6 .
how tall were you before the accident?
unfortunately , his profile says he's 6 '1 " .
so , i can wear lifts .
even with lifts you're not that tall .
so what?
no . . .
no .
no, we never discussed that .
oh , i thought you were serious , vincent .
i am serious .
i'm not doing that .
i won't do that .
jerome never questioned my committment again .
i took my mind off the pain by reminding myself that when i eventually did stand up
i'd be exactly two inches closer to the stars .
are you all right?
yeah .
do you want to go dancing?
you had to be a right hander .
no one orders southpaws any more .
jerome morrow .
it's a nice name .
it's my name .
i can't be you without it .
what makes you think you can be me at all?
look at this .
look at it .
it's nice .
i'm impressed , is it real?
are you colour blind , too , vincent?
it's silver .
jerome morrow was never meant to be one step down on the podium .
with all i had going for me , i was still second best .
me !
so how do you expect to pull this off?
i don't know , exactly .
your signature needs work .
soon came time to put our preparations to the test .
jerome had been engineered with everything he needed to get into gattaca , except the desire to do so .
do you really want to be in there?
i don't wanna be in there , i wanna be up there .
what's up there?
that's want i want to find out , jerome .
call me eugene .
my middle name .
if you're going to be jerome , you'd better start getting used to it .
i gotta get going .
where's my sample?
in the refrigerator .
door on the left .
which pouch?
oh , any of them .
you think i should test it?
if you like .
my god , what's wrong with the machine?
it's nothing wrong with the machine .
it's a hot sample .
you've been drinking again !
i haven't .
oh christ eugene , it's 8 o'clock in the morning !
i haven't !
this is no joke .
my interview is in an hour !
there's more vodka in this piss than there is piss !
i'm sorry .
i had half a glass to celebrate .
try friday's , that one will be ok .
there's only wednesday left .
wednesday .
that's the one .
listen , it's not too late to back out .
this is the last day that you're gonna be you and i'm gonna be me .
well?
congratulations .
what about the interview?
that was it .
i got it .
of course you got it .
and that's the way it was .
each day i'd dispose of as much loose skin , fingernails and hair as possible .
to limit how much of my in valid self i'd leave in the valid world .
at the same time , eugene prepared samples of his own superior body matter so that i might pass for him .
customized urine patches for the frequent substance tests .
fingertips blood sachees for security checks and vials filled with other traces .
while eugene supplied me with a new identity , i paid the rent
and kept him in the style to which he'd become accustomed .
eugene never suffered from a routine discrimination of a " utero " , " faith birth " , " in valid " as we would call it .
a " valid " , a " vitro " , a " made man " , he suffered under a different burden .
the burden of perfection .
i was now a member of a relatively new and particulary detested segment of society .
one of those that refuses to play the hand that he's dealt .
almost commonly known as a " borrowed ladder " .
or ... a " de gene erate " .
in the guise of jerome morrow i've risen quickly for the ranks of gattaca .
only one of the mission directors has ever come close to discovering my true identity .
strange to think , he may have more success exposing me in death than he ever did in life .
i think we can rule out suicide .
excuse me , sir?
nothing .
thank you .
this will take a while .
we may have to push things back .
irene , i want you to assist the investigators .
my work , director , that would put me behind .
i appreciate your sacrifice , irene .
will you seek to that i don't lose my place in line?
your place is assured .
so kindly inform the authorities that we will cooperate in any way ,
although we can't tolerate a major disruption .
director?
thank you , irene .
thank you , director .
director , how will this affect the mission?
oh , we're still going ahead as planned .
the launch window is only opened until week's end .
tragic though this event may be , it hasn't stopped the planets turning .
what happened?
i'm going up .
when?
end of the week .
end of the week , that soon?
what about the mission director?
he's dead .
are you serious?
they found him in his office this morning , beaten so badly they had to check his name tag .
you are serious .
so that's it , there's nothing between us and ignition .
i'm going up .
the man was murdered?
so?
i didn't do it .
i didn't say you did but if the man was murdered , the place is gonna be crawling with hoovers .
i'll take my chances with the j. edgars over the mission director .
besides , what if they do find something?
i'm gonna be slightly out of their jurisdiction .
we have to get drunk immediately .
good evening , gentlemen .
i hear you're leaving us , mr. morrow .
looks that way .
we're going to miss you .
you've opened the wine , i hope?
of course , sir .
pour yourself a glass , cavendish .
how old?
me?
the specimen?
i kissed him five minutes ago .
a real good one .
i'll see what i can do .
you want the full sequence?
yes .
thank you .
good luck .
9 . 3 .
quite a catch .
yes .
quite a catch .
god , how many times i've told cavendish . . .
this's gotta be open more than five minutes ago !
a wine like this needs to breathe .
remember that .
you know , they say when you're weightless is the closest thing to being in the womb .
i can't believe you pulled this off .
they're sending you up there .
up there , for christ sake !
you , of all people .
i hate to think of you alone in that room for a year .
well better think about it .
anyway , the room i'm stuck in is bigger than your tin cans .
you know what i'm saying .
what are you gonna do?
i have my books .
i go places in my head .
that'd be help if you had some company .
i have visitors .
yeah well , none that you don't pay .
i wouldn't have it any other way .
seriously , what are you going to do?
i'm going to finish this .
what's titan like this time of year?
what's titan like?
titan is exactly like this .
all the time , it's got a cloud around that's so thick , noone can tell what's underneath .
maybe there's nothing there .
there's something there .
you should be going , instead of me .
why is that?
'cause up there your legs wouldn't matter .
i'm scared of heights .
i'm sorry .
do you want this?
i'll save some for you , shall l?
i'm so sorry .
i'm really , really sorry .
don't give me a hard time .
give me a break .
come on !
help !
i'm sorry .
no , i wasn't drunk . . .
what do you mean you're not drunk? . . . when i walked in front of that car .
what car?
i stepped right out in front of it .
i've never been more sober in my life .
go to sleep .
i couldn't even get that right , could i?
if at first you don't succeed , try , try again .
go to sleep .
i'm proud of you , vincent .
you must be drunk to call me vincent .
how much do you need?
20 minutes .
you can go .
it's all right , irene .
you're excused .
we found our man .
it's the only specimen in the entire place that can't be accounted for .
every 10 years or so things go our way .
the eyelash , what do you know about it?
it's an unregistered in valid .
he was a janitor here untill a few years back , when he dissappeared out of sight .
what kind of specimen could last so many years since then .
well , take a look at the floor .
sir , i don't think anything lies a
it's also the matter of loading .
is a janitor gonna come back here after all this time to kill a man he never knew?
well , his profile does suggest a violent temperament .
if i'm not mistaken , his profile also suggests he's a sick man .
there's a 90 % chance the owner of this eylash has already died himself of natural causes .
that means there's a 10 % chance he's still alive .
it's a lost and found case , sir .
all we have to do is find the man who's minus an eylash and we have the murderer .
i'll do a cross check , i'll find out about his
already run it .
there's no record of any living relative .
that's a damn shame , sir .
i want you to check the entry log .
alibis , grudges .
i look around , i see a lot of dry eyes .
the mission director was not universally loved .
he was leading cutbacks in the programme .
with all due respect , sir . . .
whatever you say .
jerome the metronome .
i could play the piano by that heartbeat of his .
mr. director , you'd be pleased to know that we have a suspect .
that is a relief .
who is he?
we found an unaccounted for specimen in the south wing .
here's his picture .
an in valid .
we're still following other leads .
be there as it may , i'm having this posted immediately .
i'm curious , director .
an advantage , i should imagine , in your line of work .
your hiring practices . . .
our " recruitment philosophy " .
who do you have to be , to be here?
naturally , our standard is beyond that of the common citizen .
but amongst all that people you must have various levels of excellence .
occasionally we've had to accept candidates with minor shortcomings .
but nothing that would prohibit someone from working in a field such as law enforcement , for example .
now , there are enough of the right kind of people to warrant a new measuring stick .
bodies with minds to match .
essential , as we push out further and further .
yet you still constantly monitor performance .
you have to ensure the people are meeting their potential .
and exceeding it?
no one exceeds his potential .
if he did?
it would mean we did not accurately gauge his potential in the first place .
are you all right , jerome?
terrific .
the entry log for the last 7 days .
what about you , irene?
do you have an alibi?
i was alone .
i find that hard to believe .
excuse me .
i'll take care of that for you , mr. morrow .
i see i'm not the only one who looks up every time there's a launch .
hello jerome .
it's awful about the director .
awful it didn't happen sooner .
didn't he threaten to cancel your mission more than once?
somebody did you a favour .
do they have any idea whose hand i should be shaking?
they found an eyelash in the s wing .
does it have a name?
just some in valid .
jerome . . .
i had you sequenced .
i read your profile .
i'm sorry .
seems you're everything they say you are and more .
what about you , irene?
you're engineered just like the rest of us .
not quite .
unacceptable likelihood of heart failure . " i think that's what the manual says .
the only trip i'll take in space is around the sun on this satellite , right here .
if there's anything wrong with you , i can't see it from where i'm standing .
if you don't believe me . . .
here .
take it .
if you're still interested , let me know .
i'm sorry .
the wind caught it .
please check the latest gattaca bulletin .
jerome .
is this the approach path we discussed?
absolutely , director .
quite right .
listen to what i'm saying to you , i want what i ordered .
it's a completely different colour .
no .
i'm bored of talking to you .
i'm bored .
i'll call you back .
that was the company that sell us your hair dye .
they've sent me " summer wheat " instead of " honey dawn " .
any full tone is two shades light .
why don't you try a change?
i don't want to change !
we can't use a change !
now i'll probably gonna have to pay for the 5 boxes they've sent me .
we can't stay here .
the idiots i have to deal with , you wouldn't believe !
they think i killed the mission director .
what makes them think that?
they found my eyelash .
where?
in the corridor .
well , that could be worse .
they could have found it in your eye .
they've got my picture posted up all over the place .
i can't turn around without seeing my own face .
they'll recognize me .
they won't recognize you .
they will recognize me !
i don't recognize you .
they won't marry the eyelash to you ,
they won't believe that one of their elite could've suckered them all this time .
no , we change nothing we do as we planned .
you're jerome morrow , navigator 1st class .
i'm not jerome morrow .
i'm a murder suspect .
what are you doing?
that's more than a day's worth !
wait .
we can't stay here .
stop that !
oh fine , fine !
you leave if you want .
but you're not taking that stuff .
that stuff is mine !
i could've rented myself somebody with a spine
if i'd known you'd go belly up on me at the last fuckin 'gasp .
you can't quit on me now .
i've put too much into this .
what do you want me to do?
wheel in there and finish the job myself?
eugene , they are going to find me .
you still don't understand , do you?
when they look at you , they don't see you any more .
they only see me .
keep your lashes on your lids where they belong .
how could you be so careless?
i'm going out .
where are you going?
well if i'm gonna get arrested tomorrow , i'm gonna go out tonight .
are you sure that's a good idea to go out?
that was your idea not to change anything .
who's going?
i'd say everybody .
if i don't go it'll look suspicious .
you don't want to look suspicious , do you?
thanks .
who ordered this?
what are we doing here?
i'm following a lead .
forgive me , sir but that's what i do .
i'm a detective .
i follow leads .
why makes you think the owner of the eyelash is here?
he's an in valid , sir .
this is where the in valids are .
he's an in valid .
he's an in valid clever enough to go unregistered all these years .
you think he's likely to lie down for us now?
what do you suggest , sir?
move the inquiry back to the scene .
draw 5 mile radius around gattaca , sweep again .
random stops .
you're a navigator?
at gattaca?
that's what it says , doesn't it?
it doesn't say you're crippled .
i'm not crippled .
i hurt my leg training , you moron .
how dare you question me?
what's your number?
no , what's your number , you fucking flatfoot !
i said forget it .
what do you want?
an apology?
it gets to you , doesn't it .
it gets to you that i can be where you can only dream of .
i'm getting off this ball of dirt !
how dare you question me !
that's harassment .
my mistake .
what's your number?
may i remind you that this is a crime scene .
what's this man doing here?
what are you doing , old man?
doing my job , sir .
this is evidence .
but it's just trash .
you didn't know?
oh yes , yeah .
wonderful , wasn't it?
12 fingers or 1 , it's how you play .
that piece can only be played with 12 .
what's all this about?
it's probably nothing .
no , you better not .
i don't want to give you a contaminated specimen .
get my meaning?
thanks .
you never know where those swabs have been .
i want to show you something .
come on , we'll miss it .
come on .
we'll miss it .
what did i tell you?
strange .
your eyes look different .
i guess it must be the light .
must be .
positive match .
i'm impressed .
the cup was definitely used since the original sweep?
two samples , two days .
either the suspect went back to the scene of the crime to get a drink of water and i don't know anybody that thirsty .
or he still works there .
i thought we checked all the service staff .
i don't think he cleans up the place any more .
i have a feeling he might be there on a false pretense , playing somebody else's
a borrowed ladder at gattaca?
that's far fetched , but is not out of a possibility .
i find it hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers .
even if he got past their security system , he wouldn't have the mental faculty or the physical stamina .
maybe you're underestimating .
maybe he is an imposter and maybe the director found out about it .
that could be his motive .
i say we sample every employee within the parameters intravenously .
2/ 3 of their workforce fall in that category .
we'd be closing them down for days .
no , a fingertip sample or a urine should be sufficient .
i suggest blood from the vein .
i hope i'm not out of line .
it's only a matter of time , sir .
what's with the plungers , lamar?
you're openin 'up a blood bank?
only the gentlemen from the law enforcement are concerned that my testing methods have been compromised .
goddamn !
i'm sorry .
are you out of practice , lamar?
let me look at that .
it's all right .
luckily , it looks as though we have enough .
well if you need any more , you can always get it off his shoes .
irene .
so you didn't do it after all?
i guess someone beat me to it .
i guess .
i leave in two days .
i guess you know that .
but . . .
that's the last .
something's not right .
he's not here .
no , we miss something
i say we test again .
test?
i cannot allow you to disrupt our operations any further .
you're not at all concerned about having amurderer in your midst?
now , your presence is creating more of a threat .
the window for our latest launch is open for seven days once every 70 years .
so it's rather crucial we leave on time .
mission means a great deal to you , doesn't it?
your late colleague opposed it .
take another look at my profile .
you won't find a violent bone in my body .
my apologies , director .
he won't trouble you any further .
this is not the only place we can look .
ok , let's start making the rounds .
i'm luckier than most .
not as lucky as some .
i know something about that .
you , jerome?
what heart problem did you ever have?
did you get yours broken once?
i had this crazy idea that you were more interested in the murder case than me .
you're right .
that's a crazy idea .
would you like to dance?
it's funny .
you work so hard , you do everything you can to get away from a place . . .
and when you finally get your chance to leave , you find a reason to stay .
a year is a long time .
not so long .
just once around the sun .
hello , everyone , nice to see you , i'm your detective for the evening .
please don't leave the premises .
i said nobody leave !
am i speaking in some kinda strange foreign language?
check the hands , lenses , dentures , napkins , i want cigarette butts , the saliva off tea cups .
that's a familiar face .
check him out .
i thought you wanted to dance .
where are you going?
oh yeah ...
jerome !
are you insane?
come on !
where did they go?
come on .
don't you understand , i can't do that !
shh , you just did .
don't touch your face . don't swallow .
don't spit .
let's clean his teeth .
vincent !
vincent !
who's vincent?
i. . .
don't say anything .
don't say anything .
what happened?
the scars on your legs?
remember the '99 chrysler lebaron?
this is the exact height of the front fender .
looked left instead of right .
did you just make that up or do you use all the time?
i use it all the time .
i know you had something to do with the director's death .
that's not true , irene .
isn't that the man from last night?
he's nobody .
he's one of our best .
i'm certain he has nothing to do with this business .
jerome morrow .
you don't look well , jerome .
why don't you go home?
can i help you?
i'm looking for jerome morrow .
i'm sorry , he's ill .
a little nausea .
it's quite common before a mission .
i oughta pay him a visit .
i understand you can show me the way?
you don't know who he is , do you , irene?
hello?
eugene , i need you to be yourself for the day .
i was never very good at it , remember?
the investigators are coming by .
i'm supposed to be sick .
so you keep telling me?
how long have i got?
not long .
i guess he's not home .
i'm here to see jerome morrow .
that's me .
come up .
i guess he's home .
come in .
come in .
come in .
hello , sweetheart .
where's my kiss?
good to see you're feeling better .
of course , now that you're here .
who's your friend?
how can i help?
it's about the director .
again?
i hope it's no trouble .
no , no , no trouble .
forgive me for not giving your guided tour .
can't we do this another time?
this won't take a moment .
maybe he can tell me why i'm ill .
who were you expecting?
yes?
we have our man , sir .
you have him?
we have him in custody .
i'll come right away .
how are you , jerome?
not bad , jerome .
how the hell did you get up here?
i can always walk .
i've been faking it .
irene . . .
don't touch me !
listen to me , irene !
i don't even know who you are .
i'm the same person i was yesterday .
i can't hear anymore of your lies , jerome .
my name is vincent anton freeman .
and i'm a faith birth or a de gene erate or whatever you wanna call it .
but i'm not a murderer .
you're a god child?
well we do have one thing in common .
only i don't have 20 30 years left in mine .
mine is already 10, 000 beats overdue .
it's not possible .
you are the authority on what is not possible ,
aren't you , irene?
they've got you looking so hard for any flaw , that after a while that's all that you see .
for whatever it's worth , i'm here to tell you that it is possible .
it is possible .
congratulations , sir .
we did it .
his spit was found in the dead director's eye .
an unaccounted specimen .
while i was busy obsessing about an eyelash , your instincts took us in the right direction .
so the in valid had nothing to do with this?
no , our friend here acted alone .
this mission meant everything to him , didn't it?
he knows that if they miss this launch window he wouldn't live to see the next one .
and since nothing can stop the launch now , he's being very , very cooperative .
so , i imagin you'll be celebrating tonight , sir?
of course .
i think she likes us .
yeah , sure , just give her a little time and she'll get used to the idea .
what was he like?
who , the cop?
yeah .
he was just a cop .
did you catch his name?
actually my name was the topic of conversation .
yeah well , he'll be back .
you heard what he said , they have their man .
it's over .
no , it's not over .
i have to meet him .
vincent?
my god , you have changed .
has it been so long , you don't recognize your own brother?
are we brothers?
our parents both died thinking they'd outlived ya .
i had my doubts .
what are you doing here , anton?
i should ask you that question .
i have a right to be here .
you don't .
you almost sound as if you believe that .
i committed no murder .
you must be disappointed .
you committed fraud .
listen , you're in a lot of trouble , vincent .
i can get you out of here .
do you have any idea what it took to get in here?
you've gone as far as you can go .
you come with me now !
there's still a few million miles left to go .
it's over .
is that the only way you can succeed , is to see me fail?
i'm telling you ...
god !
even you are going to tell me what i can and can't do now?
in case you haven't noticed , i don't need any rescuing .
but you did , once .
you've got all the answers , how do you explain that?
you didn't beat me that day .
i beat myself .
who are you trying to convince?
do you want me to prove it to you?
it's not important , anton .
it's forgotten .
i'll prove it to you .
do you want me to prove it to you?
i'll prove it to you !
i do .
vincent !
vincent !
where's the shore?
we're too far out !
do you wannna quit?
we'repbr too far out !
do you wanna quit?
no .
vincent !
how are you doing this , vincent?
how have you done any of this?
we have to go back .
no .
it's too late for that .
we're close to the other side .
what other side?
do you want to drown us both?
you want to know how i did it?
this is how i did it , anton .
i never saved anything for the swim back .
you couldn't see , could you?
that night , crossing the street .
you crossed anyway .
if you're still interested , let me know .
sorry . . .
the wind caught it .
you're flying today , aren't you?
look at what a mess you're in .
come on , i have your samples ready .
i don't need any samples where i'm going .
you might when you get back .
everything you need to last you two lifetimes .
why have you done all this?
so jerome will always be here when you need him .
where are you going?
i'm travelling , too .
i don't know how to thank you .
no , no . . .
i got the better end of the deal .
i only lent you my body .
you lent me your dream .
not until you're upstairs .
what is this?
new policy .
flight got you nervous?
there's a problem , lamar .
i never did tell you about my son , did i?
he's a big fan of yours .
just remember that i was as good as any and better than most .
he wants to apply here .
i could have gone up and back and nobody wouldn't have been the wiser .
unfortunately , my son's not all that they promised .
but then , who knows what he could do?
right?
for future reference , right handed men don't hold it with their left .
just one of those things .
you're going to miss your flight , vincent .
for someone who was never meant for this world ,
i must confess , i'm suddenly having a hard time leaving it .
of course , they say every atom in our bodies was once part of a star .
maybe i'm not leaving .
maybe i'm going home .
