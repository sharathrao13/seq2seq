so we're planning our next vacation .
i want australia , she wants ltaly .
i like snorkelling .
she likes garlic .
all of a sudden , out of nowhere , she says to me : do i need her?
jesus , benny .
what kind of a question is that?
need?
what does it really mean to need somebody?
benny , fuel line .
waldo , could you answer that phone?
hello .
i need a cheque , benny .
cod .
in a minute .
meet me in the office .
all right .
whoa !
put that out !
i got a fuel line broke .
hey , benny .
joon's on the phone again .
i'll call back .
find out what she wants .
it's an emergency .
she says you're runnin 'low on peanut butter super chunks .
an emergency ...
the issue is jelly .
you only like two kinds .
you either like grape or boysenberry .
which is it?
all right .
yeah , yeah , yeah , peanut butter .
i know .
super crunch .
i'll see you at six , ok?
bye .
thanks for waitin ', ma'am .
i'm afraid the best we can do for you is gonna be ...
it's gonna be $750 .
if you check around , you'll see that that is a really good deal .
yeah?
that is a really very good deal , ma'am .
a little too good .
let's do it .
come here .
come here .
you're not doing your job !
what is your job , anyway?
to clean this house , but not any more !
get out of my sight !
you wouldn't dare , joon !
what is going on here?
joon?
mrs smail , please , let me explain .
beware , the winds of reason shall blow stern .
what?
i'm done , mr pearl .
i'm done !
the mule's turned to glue !
she wanders off unescorted .
she has sudden outbursts .
she's simply unmanageable .
mrs smail , wait .
please , let me talk to her .
i can talk to her .
you can't quit on such short notice .
i'm sorry , sir .
in lreland , we have a sayin '.
when a boat runs ashore , the sea has spoken .
come on !
we can't play three handed poker .
she's gonna be alone every day .
i'm not leavin 'her alone at night , too .
so bring her .
shejust paints and reads .
yeah , and lights things on fire .
that happened once .
i got a fire extinguisher .
just bring her .
get your ass over here .
don't forget the louis prima record .
remember , always play for keeps .
all right , all right , all right .
yeah , i'll be there .
ok .
joon , dinner !
spaghetti and salad?
in that order?
what happened between you and mrs smail?
she was given to fits of semiprecious metaphors .
she's a housekeeper , not an english professor .
she moves things .
she said you wandered off .
did you leave the house alone?
define " alone " .
you know full well what i'm talkin 'about .
i can't be worried about you knocking another housekeeper into retirement .
first , it was mrs larkspur .
a woman deeply and hygienically disturbed .
her hair smelled .
but then it was mrs piltz .
piltz?
the answer's in the question .
let's face it , benjamin .
hiring housekeepers is not your forte .
well , until i do find another housekeeper , you are gonna stick close to the house . understand?
now have some salad .
by the way , i want you to come with me to my poker game .
benny ...
come on .
you'll have a good time .
web belt and buckle .
classical greek martini shaker .
six turkey feather darts .
i'll see you with a deanna durbin album .
come on .
and i'll raise you with a stethoscope .
does it have little plastic earpieces?
what do you care?
you never win , mike .
i don't want 'em stabbin 'my eardrums .
steering wheel knob .
salad shooter .
'56 plymouth tyre iron .
fold o .
you must have a good hand , huh?
no , i'm bluffin '.
really?
come on .
you gotta play to find out .
ok .
1 50 feet of coaxial cable .
show 'em .
full house .
jacks over fours .
oh , shit .
i thought he was bluffin '.
will someone get some air to his brain?
he was bluffing about bluffing .
you're a real pal , benny .
i got a solution to your housekeeper problem .
you can have my roommate .
that's a terrific offer , benjamin .
save you from the chore of smail shopping .
those places are such drudgery .
montgomery and smails , smails and roebuck , smails r us ...
joon .
when did you get a roommate?
since last week .
my cousin pounded into town and life's gone from heaven to hell in seven days .
just like the good lord intended .
26 years old , he can't even read .
spends all day polishing my plastic forks .
when you say he can't read , what do you mean?
like words?
yeah .
and he keeps me up all night watchin 'stupid old movies .
my work's starting to suffer .
you install cable tv .
joon , will you please glue your sequins?
have we an internal sequin issue to deal with , benjamin?
all right , can we make this the last hand?
come on , come on .
play cards .
two tickets , tomorrow night's baseball game .
one pocket fisherman .
fold .
do you ever stay in?
snorkel mask .
she knows how to rattle the day help .
i think we need to find someone more understanding than mrs smail .
tell me , how are you two getting along? us?
fine .
normal .
you know , fine .
why?
i'll level with you .
i think it's time you gave some serious consideration to a group home .
she already has a home .
benny , she'd be with her peers .
she hates her peers .
she's already quit the two day centres to prove it .
look , all we need right now is a new housekeeper .
well , i know of no one else .
you've been up and down the list .
you might want to consider that there are some people more capable of handling these episodes than you .
i think that you two living together may not be the best thing any more .
i'm her brother , and i'm her only family .
and we've done just fine , the two of us , for 1 2 years .
yes , but her stress level is always a factor in her display of symptoms .
her agitation should be kept to a minimum .
everybody gets agitated .
sometimes it's the only option .
benny , don't get me wrong .
i'm impressed how you've managed this long .
but a group home would let her develop other relationships .
we don't know this , but what if she were capable of a job?
they'd encourage her in that direction .
these are very nice places nurturing , supportive .
i'm not farming her out .
i have every right to be outside , officer .
i have every right .
yes , ma'am .
may i see some id , please?
waldo , did you start that brake job yet?
joon called .
you've run out of tapioca .
she what?
oh , and the police will corroborate .
holy shit .
listen , jack , you wanna go to the baseball game tonight?
hey , thanks , benny .
box seats .
hello?
joon?
time for your medicine , joon .
good night , steve .
oh , hello .
how's it goin '?
i appreciate the deal on the engine .
no problem .
is it runnin 'all right?
yeah , it's running great .
good .
so ... can i ...
can i make it up to you with some dinner?
some dinner?
are you serious?
yeah .
dinner with you .
you know what?
i can't .
i mean , i'd like to ...
it's ok .
ok .
stupid .
stupid .
18 1 5 .
17 16 .
18 1 5 !
it caught the corner .
it was a foot off the table .
it was not .
juniper ...
benjamin ...
don't underestimate the mentally ill .
we know how to count .
ok , fine .
17 16 .
you can't give me what was mine .
you're trying to cheat .
i'm not .
you're cheating .
joon , you're the one who's cheating .
you're all trying to cheat me .
you're trying to cheat .
yeah .
i spoke to some of the guys on the staff , benny .
nobody wants to be a housekeeper .
i will .
i'll keep tryin '.
but i gotta tell you honestly , i don't think so .
yeah .
ok .
thanks .
bye .
ok , stevie .
i mean , i can't even keep a goldfish alive .
what chance do i have with joon?
if somethin 'bad happened to her , i'd ...
i'd never ever be able to forgive myself .
a group home is the right thing for her , benny .
yeah .
this is definitely for her own good .
hey , it's for both your own good .
how much longer can you do this to yourself?
your life is literally passing you by .
you're right .
you're right .
what am i doing with myself?
i spend my life workin 'on cars and takin 'care of my sister .
i can't have a relationship without havin 'to worry about how joon is gonna fit in .
once she gets settled in , you could actually take a vacation .
travel a little .
i can hold down the fort .
travel?
travel?
benny , there's a whole world out there .
i mean , picture yourself on the open road .
wind in the hair in the ei camino .
highway stretchin 'out ...
what's that , up ahead?
a lovely motorist , stranded .
carburettor trouble .
better investigate .
yeah , right .
i'm gonna be stoppin 'every 1 5 minutes to call joon to see how she's doin '.
ok , let's see .
black sabbath , over there .
is that a flashlight?
it's a brush kind of a thing .
here's a hat .
where's the batteries?
you didn't win batteries .
those are mine .
ok .
hey , guys , hurry it up !
or we'll start without you .
i've been known to play a little cards .
box of 30 aught 6 cartridges .
medium sized , green haired troll .
soap on a rope , slightly used .
cards?
three .
cards?
two .
and the dealer takes ... three .
pass .
re grout my shower .
blue grout .
i fold .
shampoo my dog .
lava lamp .
paint the exterior of my house .
hey , come on , slow down .
this is supposed to be reasonable stakes .
that's a see and a raise .

you take my cousin off my hands .
wait , wait , wait .
just stop .
benny's gonna strangle you guys .
chill out , thomas .
joon , we gotta go .
flush !
full house .
yes .
yes !
benny , tonight's your lucky night .
mike warned her it was for keeps .
what?
what was for keeps?
i lost .
what's in the pot?
a cousin .
rules are rules .
without 'em there's no order in the universe .
don't you give me that crap .
you took advantage .
of your sick sister .
a heart flush is a perfectly respectable hand .
not respectable enough .
hey , shut up , mike .
i am not takin 'this guy home .
you have to !
remember the bet i lost last year?
when i had to re plate your socket set , i didn't back out .
you can't bet a human being !
oh , well , if you're gonna be a baby about it ...
all right , mike .
you wanna play like that?
i'll take him .
i may not be responsible for what i'm gonna do to him , but i'll take him .
oh , man .
what are you doin ', you jerk?
somethin 'wrong with your car .
what did you do with my hubcaps?
i don't know .
i'm sam .

mentally ill .
really?
yeah .
but , i mean , don't worry about it .
but just let her go about her routine .
her routine is everything to her .
oh , and don't hang around her room while she's painting .
she hates that .
no .
if she runs hot and cold on you , just ignore it .
that's just the way it works .
listen , if she starts talkin 'to herself , don't worry about it , but don't answer .
ok .
she sometimes hears voices in her head .
that comes with the territory , too .
and ... just make sure that nothin 'and , you know , i mean nothin 'happens to her .
ok .
ok .
all right .
having a boo radley moment , are we?

no , i took him home .
you took him home?
yeah .
to your house?
yeah , to my house .
what , are you crazy?
hey , believe me , it's only temporary .
great .
hey , maybe he can tell joon about the group home , huh?
if i'm gonna do this group home thing , i gotta figure out the best way to tell her .

i'm gonna have a talk with him .
no , you're not .

and i just kept seeing ...
he didn't mean to do it .
do it?
what?
what did he ...
what did he do?
he cleaned the house .
and you kicked him out for that?
maybe i should invite him back in .
yeah .
before someone sticks a stamp on his head and mails him to guam .
some cultures ... are defined by their relationship to cheese .
is that a fact?
he can really cook , can't he?
yeah .
although , for grilled cheese , i might've used the wool setting .
that's what i told him .
really?
what did he use?
rayon .
silk would've been too soggy .
cotton would've ...
would've burned it .
right .
fortunately he consulted me before giving it steam .
i was against it .
i wish he could be my new smail .
# the melodious songs of the blessed

good night .
good night .
you need some help?
dear mom , i've departed mike's with love and gratitude and am now living with benny and joon pearl , two devoted new friends .
benny's predisposition to hypertense lrish monologists notwithstanding , he has given me a job as a domestic engineer and seems pleased with me so far .
love , sam .
wow .
i didn't know i could talk like that .
tapioca?
oh .
yeah .
ok .
thank you , ruthie .
you're welcome , sam .
let me know if you need anything , ok?
you don't like raisins?
not really .
why?
they used to be ... fat and juicy .
and now they're twisted .
they had their lives stolen .
they taste sweet , but really they're just humiliated grapes .
i can't say i'm a big supporter of the raisin council .
did you see those raisins on tv?
the ones that sing and dance and stuff?
they scare me .
yeah .
me , too .
it's sick .
they make them sing and dance so people will eat them .
it's a shame about raisins .
cannibals .
yeah .
do you like avocados?
they're a fruit , you know .
ruthie?
do you got any avocados?
joon?
you're very pretty when you're off work , ruthie .
thank you .
maybe i should quit my job .
where the hell have you two been?
don't worry .
they were with me , running some errands .
oh , hi .
how you doin '?
hi .
running errands?
you ran an errand?
yes , i did .
i ran an errand .
they're both named steven .
one with a v and one with a ph .
look , look , look !
ruthie's movie .
yes .
and she's staying for dinner , too .
come on in .
come on in .
so why'd you leave?
la?
i wasn't that good of an actress .
well , that's not how sam tells it .
he's ravin 'about you .
well , he's sweeter than he is judgmental .
how long have you known him?
sam? uh ... 72 hours .
be serious .
i am serious .
really?
i'm always serious .
i'm too serious .
d'you ever get to the point in your life where nothin 'makes any sense?
brad?
brad?
quit kidding around .
this isn't funny any more .
can we turn this off?
can we just turn this off?
no !
you !
cindy !
why did you do this?
you're sick .
you need help .
let me ...
don't !
he was mine .
he was mine !
and ifl can't have him , no one can .
not even you .
you didn't have to buy that same dress .
but you are my sister , cindy .
i'm sorry about brad .
we didn't mean to fall in love at the party .
itjust happened .
let's just forget it .
there'll be other boys , other midnight swims , other prom dresses .
no !
no , cindy !
try it again .
ah .
there's only two reasons a car won't start : either you're not gettin 'fuel or you're not gettin 'fire .
you've got fire .
i think you'd better let me drive you home .
sorry .
thanks .
here it is .
it's right here .
second job , huh?

i mean , yeah ...
i never had a fish .

no . underprivileged childhood , i guess .
downright un american , if you ask me .
yeah .
you can have one of mine , if you want .
no , i couldn't possibly .
they were a gift .
but we could share it .
like joint custody .
you could take it on the weekends .
what is this?

joon tells me he's a man .
well , you know joon , how flowery she gets with words .
so she's lying?
i mean , is it a man or isn't it?
well ...
yes , technically .
he's really just a guy , a friend .
where does this leave the group home?
i take it you haven't talked to her about it .
no , not yet .
the admission date is less than a week away .
but the thing is , she's really doin 'fine .

come on , come on .
give me a reason why i shouldn't have you arrested .
it's that one .
yeah .

sam , where you goin '?
benny , this is exactly what we were trying to avoid .
by now , joon would be in a caring and controlled environment .
isn't it obvious now that you two need some distance?
why don't we ask joon what she wants?
sam , what are you doin '?
hey , sam , come on !
get down , right now !
i don't know exactly what i want .
i do know ... that i am tired of everyone telling me what to do .

sam , leave that !
i'm beggin 'you !
joon , we want what's best for you .
i know that .
i ...
sam , come down now !
you're gonna get in trouble !
i think i want to try living in my own apartment .
hm .
i don't know .
sam , stop swinging !
but i'm willing to let you try .
i'll prepare the papers for her release .
thank you , dr garvey .
come down !
sam !
whoa !
whoa !
are you ok?
ouch !
ouch !
i know .
me , too .
i'm gonna check you out , ok?
ok .
haven't we tried this before?
yeah , but my life's a lot less complicated now .
is joon inside?
yeah .
ok .
