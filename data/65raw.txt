she makes me restless .
i can't concentrate in doing anything ,
not even holding a pair of chopsticks .
can't control any one of my limbs !
i really wish to hold her day and night ,
instead of watching tv alone .
but she'll never know
or even notice this guy me !
doting on her forever
nervously biting my fingers ,
my dignity is gone
but she won't know my thoughts !
she makes me losing weight
and terribly upset .
i really want to put up an advert .
and describe in details my loving feelings .
crazily in love
chewing up tissue paper .
i should find a few doctors ,
to cure my infatuation .
checking here and checking there .
but still can't cure my infatuation !
sonny , be brave
stop crying , don't let them despise you .
mom !
albert !

my dear son
i'm dumb and don't deserve to be your husband .
albert
stop it .
i knew you're not smart .
i've got a lot to say .
let's wait until we're home .
that's the bad guy .
i'm experienced with them .
just flatter them .
and everything'll be fine .
no , he doesn't like flattery , he's rambo type .
ok .
you've got the prism , when can we leave?
not yet !
you've agreed on a fair exchange !
a fair exchange
nothing's fair nowadays .
you're dumb !
dumb enough to give you the real one?
this is a fake?
it is ! ...
no problem , let's try and see .
help yourself , it's useless .
you're on , and we'll know .
your big mouth .
how is it?
