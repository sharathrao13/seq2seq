lazy toy brain .
lousy try , brian .
what are you doing , buzz?
it's some sort of message encoded on that vehicle's i. d. tag .
liz try bran .
it's just a license plate .
it's just a jumble of letters .
yeah , and there are about 3 . 5 million registered cars in the tri county area alone .
lou's thigh burn .

let's leave buzz to play with his toys .

so who's with me?
i'm packing you an extra pair of shoes and your angry eyes just in case .

i'll do my best , son .
okay , fellas .

the idea is to let go .
we'll be back before andy gets home .

they don't call this the old abandoned mine for nothin ', prospector .

oh , wow !
will you look at me?
it's like i'm fresh out of the box !
look at this stitching !
andy's gonna have a hard time rippin 'this !
hello !
h hi !
hello !
great .
now you can go .
well , what a good idea .
woody , don't be mad at jessie .
she's been through more than you know .
why not make amends before you leave , huh?
it's the least you can do .
all right .
but i don't know what good it'll do .
hey .
whatcha doin 'way up here?
thought i'd get one last look at the sun before i get packed away again .
look , jessie .
i know you hate me for leaving , but i have to go back .
i'm still andy's toy .
well , if you knew him , you'd understand .
see , andy's a real
let me guess .
andy's a real special kid .
and to him , you're his buddy , his best friend .
and when andy plays with you , it's like even though you're not moving , you feel like you're alive , because that's how he sees you .
how did you know that?
because emily was just the same .
she was my whole world .
when somebody loved me everything was beautiful every hour we spent together lives within my heart and when she was sad i was there to dry her tears and when she was happy so was i  when she loved me
through the summer and the fall  we had each other that was all just she and i together like it was meant to be and when she was lonely i was there to comfort her and i knew that she loved me [ both giggling ]
so the years went by i stayed the same but she began to drift away i was left alone still i waited for the day  when she'd say i will always love you lonely and forgotten i never thought she'd look my way she smiled at me and held me just like she used to do like she loved me  when she loved me  when somebody loved me everything was beautiful every hour we spent together lives within my heart  when she loved me
you never forget kids like emily or andy .
but they forget you .
jessie , i i didn't know .
just go .
how long will it last , woody?
do you really think ...
how long will it last , woody?
do you really think ...
andy is gonna take you to college or on his honeymoon?
andy's growing up , and there's nothing you can do about it .
it's your choice , woody .
you can go back , or you can stay with us and last forever .
you'll be adored by children for generations .
who am i to break up the roundup gang?
hey , woody , are you in here?
nah .
