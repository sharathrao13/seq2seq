the rest of it is at my house .
i'll pick that up tonight while you ...
information?
well , start by giving me some .
we on the same page?
you know what i'm talking about .
last time out , i went down , and you disappeared .
look , you aren't the only one who lost something that day .
when the fire started , you were busy with the general .
some of us went in to see who we could save .
now , you think this looks bad?
you should've seen it before i got it fixed .
guess nobody's story has a happy ending .
story's not over yet , soldier .
shavers ... ... can you make that into a personal weapon?
give me an hour .

i'm really starting to miss the old xxx .
stop your vehicle now .
okay , i see you .
hey , get your ass out the driver's seat .
mission accomplished .
darius stone .
born south side , d. c. mother died young , father raised him .
not much to report till '88 .
his dad was killed by a stray bullet in a 211 , and darius went off the grid .
started with graffiti , reckless driving .
quickly worked his way up to grand theft auto and resisting arrest .
took him some time to find his calling in the navy .
specifically , the navy seals .
trained sniper , top scores .
urban recon , demolition .
the highest dive in navy history , 250 feet .
augustus gibbons recruited him into an elite unit , level 5 classified .
ran ops in eastern europe till christmas in kosovo .
their general ordered them to set a fire to clear civilians ... ... but stone refused .
led a mutiny against a four star general ... ... the current secretary of defense , george deckert ... ... who had him court martialed for a 20 year term .
ten for disobeying direct orders ... ... and another 10 for breaking the general's jaw .
this is the last footage we have on him .
a meeting with his lawyer , jonathan edward cochran .
oh , that's cute .
johnnie cochran .
i don't think mr. stone can afford johnnie's fee .
do we have audio?
it's attorney client .
no mikes .
hold it there .
okay , reel it back .
back , back , back .
freeze it .
blow it up .
gibbons and stone on a comeback tour .
all right , listen up .
i want all eyes up and running on these two .
and i want hard 20s on the rest of their old unit .
i wanna know where they are ... ... i wanna know what they're doing , and i wanna know now .
i'm disappointed , auggie .
checkmate in three?
you should've seen it coming .
relax .
have a drink .
i took the liberty of pouring myself ...
you were always taking liberties .
same old gibbons .
good soldier with a bad attitude .
you know , i always remember the first day we met .
i remember the last day i saw you .
i bet you do .
didn't heal too well , did it?
some wounds never do .
i never asked you to go into that fire .
you just set it and watched it burn .
we did what needed to be done .
is that what you call it?
doing what you need to do "?
sixteen of my men killed?
what's that , just more friendly fire?
some men die so others may live .
funny ... ... that you never seem to be the one doing any of the dying .
i'll do whatever it takes to best protect this nation .
you're not protecting the nation .
you're doing this to protect yourself .
why?
what fires you starting now?
we both live in the same world .
we know what's out there .
save the speech .
just so you know ... ... whatever you're up to , you're not getting away with it .
why?
because darius stone is gonna stop me?
i'm sorry .
was that supposed to be a surprise?
gibbons , i know every move you make even before you do .
you still work for me , whether you know it or not .
i never worked for you .
i work for my country .
i don't know what's more pathetic ... ... a man that plays chess with himself ... ... or a man that doesn't see he's already lost .
make it look like an accident .
zero exposure .
sir , they found gibbons .
<i>investigators say an apparent</ i> <i>gas leak triggered the explosion . </ i>
<i>the fire department was too late</ i> <i>to save the occupant ... </ i> <i> ... but managed to contain the fire</ i> <i>before it spread . </ i>

gibbons said it was on the hard drive .
what are you doing?
i read about that .
cold war .
old school , right?
not that old school .
all right .
now , which one's charlie?
only one way to find out .
ready .
aim .
fire .
ready .
aim .
fire .
order arms .
like our lord and savior ... ... augustus eugene gibbons died in our service .
head of the nsa , fbl , joint chiefs , secretary of state .
damn .
you know what this means , right?
what?
they're gonna kill me next .
give me those .
damn , man .
if we're working together , you should work on your partner skills .
like , if you want something , try " please , " " may i borrow ...?
please , may i borrow the binoculars ... ... before i kick your teeth in?
okay .
see , now , that's a start .
not bad .
deckert?
you know secretary deckert?
oh , yeah .
we go way back .
but he hated everything about gibbons .
so , what is he doing here?
charlie .
you found him .
her .
her?
can you get me a suit?
oh , so now you wanna blend .
i hear this place has the best gumbo in town .
excuse me .
i'm actually meeting someone for lunch .
relax , charlie .
this'll only take a minute .
how did you know my name?
who are you?
we have a mutual friend .
augustus gibbons .
had a mutual friend .
and you didn't answer my question .
who are you?
my name is darius stone .
stone?
you have half the suits in this city looking for you .
why in the world would you come here?
trust me ... ... they won't look for a guy like me in a place like this .
well , no offense , but i don't trust anybody right now .
good .
that means we got something in common .
charlie .
i'm sorry i'm so late .
i had that urban youth meeting .
it ran over .
we're trying to set up that after school ... ... gun instructional program for kids and ...
i'm sorry .
dickie ambrose , nra .
hi .
reverend billy bob baker , southern baptist brotherhood .
well , it's just great to meet you , reverend .
hey , listen , we're setting up this rally upstate next week ... ... and i was just wondering if there was some way we could attract ... ... you know , some upstanding african americans like yourself .
you got any advice for us?
well , dick , perhaps you could tell your members ... ... to stop buying country music , stop burning crosses ... ... and stop shooting black folks .
hear me?
now , if that don't work ... ... try a cookout with free food .
preferably fried .
dick ... ... would you mind terribly if we rescheduled?
i think that would be ...
yeah , that's fine .
i have a lot of stuff to do .
reverend , i'll ...
call me .
i'll call you about that .
tell me about you and the captain .
i was gibbons 'contact on the hill .
i'm an aide to the senate subcommittee on military action .
military?
deckert .
secretary of defense deckert?
there's not a bullet shot in the dark that he don't know about .
so tell me something , charlie .
can you get me close to him?
well , reverend ... ... you think you can lay your hands on a tuxedo?
you made it .
you know , i never miss a party .
not quite the tux i had in mind .
yes , but i'm blending .
you see the guest of honor?
those bodyguards?
seal team four .
half my old unit .
and not the better half .
who's the ugly general he's talking to?
jack pettibone .
vice chair , joint chiefs .
doesn't look too happy .
must be the music .
one way to find out .
i truly can't believe what i'm hearing .
we go back 30 years , jack .
same blood in the same mud , and you never questioned my command .
i presume you've heard of the united states congress .
jack ... ... this country is being led down the wrong path .
you really think you can do this , don't you?
with just a few regiments .
once we lead , the full force will follow .
the clock is ticking .
with or without you .
three days .
he's here .
black guy , white tux .
had enough of the party?
hold on .
you asked me to track down the rest of their old troop?
well , half of them are still enlisted .
what about the other half?
gone .
missing .
the same men that backed stone against deckert .
every single one of them just disappeared .
wait a minute .
this is your home?
not bad for a senator's aide .
i'm not just a senator's aide .
i'm also a senator's daughter .
james mayweather , virginia .
think daddy's ready to meet a guy like me?
actually , daddy's out of town .
really?
make yourself at home , darius .
not a bad place to grow up , i guess .
only on the surface .
growing up in d. c. politics is like living in a snake pit .
everybody fighting for territory .
sounds a lot like where i grew up .
oh , no .
this is nothing like where i grew up .
let's get you out of those clothes , shall we?
here we go .
why don't you try these on .
not really my style .
why don't you go ahead and get cleaned up .
there's some fresh towels in the bathroom .
full service , huh?
you know , if you need anything ... ... l'm just right down the hall .
anything?
anything at all .
how about some fries and a shake?
the things i can't do for my country .
charlie?
charlie .
pettibone?
she set me up .
bitch .
<i>this is the police . </ i>
<i>come out with your hands</ i> <i>behind your head . </ i>
we got the vice chair of the joint chiefs in there .
the assailant is armed and dangerous .
proceed with extreme caution , gentlemen .
gus , get me a hostage negotiator , clear a two block radius ... ... and five is the active perimeter .
better make that 10 .
captain , the man's a special forces sniper .
keep all fields clear at least half a mile downwind .
who the hell are you?
kyle steele , nsa .
captain , i need to speak to this man alive .
so?
it's a matter of national security , sir .
where the hell are you going?
going inside .
listen , i don't care who you are .
you got six minutes till we breach .
stone .
i'm coming in unarmed .
all right , close that door .
hands .
step forward .
how you know i wouldn't shoot you the second you stepped through?
i didn't .
you got five minutes till they knock that door down .
so let's skip the chitchat .
where's pettibone?
upstairs , dead .
you do it?
lf i did it ... ... you wouldn't know until i wanted you to .
now , turn around .
stone , this doesn't look too good , man .
an escaped convict breaks into a house with an automatic in hand ... ... and a dead man upstairs .
i didn't break in .
now , move .
you didn't break in here?
so , what , the general invited you over for a nightcap?
what happened?
you guys felt like playing russian roulette?
this is not my gun .
you expect me to buy that line?
it's not a line , it's the truth .
they set me up .
who set you up?
deckert .
deckert .
secretary of defense deckert .
he clipped gibbons when he got too close .
and now pettibone .
too close to what?
stone , we have three minutes .
level with me .
why are we here?
why'd you go after pettibone?
i didn't go after nobody .
i don't even know the guy .
never seen him before in my life .
easy .
that sure looks a lot like you .
damn , they're good .
think now is really the best time for a snack?
what they got out there , three teams?
flash bangs , body armor , heat scopes .
am i close?
stone , i wanna help you here , i really do .
but if you run , you look guilty .
brother , i was born looking guilty .
and now ... ... it's time for you to go .
where is he?
where is he?
captain , i got him .
looks like upstairs bathroom .
okay , go get him .
<i>this is the last known photograph</ i> <i>of the suspect . </ i>
cute picture .
yeah .
haircut suits you , definitely . <i>near charlottesville , virginia . </ i>
<i>the assailant is assumed</ i> <i>to be armed and dangerous . </ i>
<i>one of general pettibone's</ i> <i>closest friends ... </ i> <i> ... was defense secretary</ i> <i>george deckert . </ i>

they're not coming for the funeral .
same blood , same mud .
pettibone and deckert both served for over 30 years together .
so that means pettibone's troops are also ...?
deckert's .
correct .
what's that got to do with the funeral?
the perfect cover .
deckert does the guest list ... ... only invites his boys to town .
he's got his army .
now , he's gotta be loading up .
how would he get his gear?
all orders go through his department , the dod .
right .
you want me to hack in?
to the u. s. department of defense?
we're talking 500 acres of hardware .
cray supercomputers , encryption chips ... ... not to mention more firewalls than the nsa , cla and the irs combined .
exactly .
hold my chips .
you know , you don't have to wait up .
you think i'd leave you alone with my car?
what's so special about this one?
shelby cobra prototype , 600 horses , 10, 000 rpm .
only three off the rack .
and we sold it for half a mil to some senator ... ... who'll never take her out of first gear .
half a mil for a car?
you been gone a while , d.
everything's more expensive now .
i could see that .
come here .
you've done real good , lo .
no rollbacks , part bins or stripped engines .
it's a long way from zeke's chop shop .
still got a few bins in the back .
and i still get my hands dirty .
classic's still a classic .
you remember the first time we dropped gears in this one?
i remember three squad cars at 100 plus on the parkway .
oh , she was fast .
yes , she was .
you remember all that damage we did in the back seat?
that was a long time ago , d.
not for me .
ready to do some more damage?

george , i'm addressing the nation tonight .
so , what's the hang up on the new military bill?
well , if you're reducing troops , closing bases ... ... and cutting r& d , you leave us vulnerable .
george , we need to increase international aid .
we need to reverse this isolationist doctrine .
maybe then we can turn some of these enemies into allies .
i know this doesn't particularly thrill you , george .
but this is going to be my legacy .
sir .
do i have your support?
it goes without saying , mr. president .

a military map .
with attack routes , targets ...
i see that .
where'd you get it?
upstate .
deckert's little boy scouts are gearing up for world war iv .
they got tanks , choppers .
they got gibbons .
what do you mean?
gibbons is not dead .
he's locked up with half my old unit .
upstate?
correct .
deckert is setting them up for a fall .
fall for what?
what do you think?
this man is making a move on the u. s. capitol .
see this?
map came from national recon .
yeah , deckert's making a move .
he's running security ... ... for the state of the union tonight .
he's not attacking , he's guarding these targets .
oh , that's beautiful .
perfect cover .
he's got his old crew suited and booted .
look , these boys don't play defense .
just offense .
it's not enough .
what if you're wrong?
i was wrong .
i thought you was more than just another suit .
sir , the security detail ... ... they're all ex military .
yeah , i can see that .
all of them served with gibbons and stone .
it's deckert's unit .
think we got something .
world war iv .
anything the defense department needs to know?
sure it's nothing you don't already know , sir .
george deckert .
secretary deckert ... ... this is agent steele .
kyle , the secretary wanted to check in on the gibbons case .
i have a personal interest in the case .
captain gibbons was a friend .
well , you can rest assured we're doing everything we can to find him .
find him?
you know , we never did id his body .
terrible thing , accident like that .
could happen to anyone .
tell me , kyle , what did darius stone say to you?
what do you mean?
you were the last to talk to him ... ... before he got away .
he didn't say much .
no , just a bunch of wild conspiracy theories , that's all .
sounds like stone .
well , if you hear anything ...
i'll know who to chase down .
sir , could you tell me something?
i've always wondered ... ... how do you pick the men who protect the president?
simple .
i choose men i can trust .
like gibbons .
would've been good to have him there tonight , huh , sir?
oh , he'll be there .
in spirit .
i'm sure he will .
good luck , sir .
sounds like the right bank's running leaner than the left .
you wanna richen her up , you're gonna have to remap the ecu .
what , are you surprised?
yeah .
fact you know how to tune up a truck .
i didn't always wear a suit .
how'd you find me?
it's my job , darius .
i'm very good at it .
can we talk?
you were right .
deckert knew gibbons was alive .
look at this .
president , vp , speaker of the house , secretary of state .
the chain of command .
he takes them out , he's what?
deckert becomes the new president .
that's right .
cleanest revolution in history .
yeah .
why are you here?
call the white house .
can't .
we don't know how deep this goes .
so , what's your plan?
figure we gotta go outside the box on this one .
how far outside the box are you prepared to go?
because to get us close to the capitol ... ... we're gonna need some brothers we can trust .
ain't no place like home .
man , y'all almost had me too .
they got jokes , man .
you hear that?
they got jokes .
no joke .
we need your help .
so why don't you go to the police?
we don't trust the police .
heard that .
hold this , baby .
one second .
man , you know we got your back .
but this ain't got nothing to do with us .
this got everything to do with you .
don't do it for the red , white and blue , do it for yourself .
do it for the right to hack and jack cars of the highest quality ... ... on the same block as the white house .
it's the american way of life , bro .
now , if you wanna protect that way of life ... ... then you gotta step up and fight for it .
because if deckert takes over , freedom won't be free for long .
nice speech .
yeah .
the freedom part was a bit much , though .
i got some federal heat .
immigration , irs .
couple of homeboys unjustly accused .
i do this for you , you'll hook us up?
i'll do what i can .
fair enough .
all right , fellas , get your gear together .
we got some work to do .
janky , kevlar panels .
killa , super jacks .
dizzle , heavy duty roll cages .
assholes and elbows , gentlemen .
let's go .
toby .
to deal with these guys , we're gonna need some serious gear .
well , it's about time .
god , i am so glad to hear you say that , x.
i got some stuff you're gonna love .
laser scope ... ... frequency lock , gps autotracker .
this will tell you what perfume a chick's wearing ... ... from 30 miles away .
that'll come in handy .
so will these .
basic scramblers , jammers , circuit jacks .
whatever you need .
now , this is the house special .
i call this one the glove .
so does everybody else .
not everybody else has electro charge pneumatic suction .
turn this bad boy on ...
see?
nothing .
nothing at all .
chill out with the butt ...
don't .
just ...
hey , hey .
hey .
come on , man .
why you gotta play around here?
hey !
we need firepower .
do you have anything that shoots bullets?
i don't , but homeland security does .
lola .
come on , man , please .
okay .
i'll just call the pentagon and see if they deliver .
we don't have to .
they've been running weapons across country ... ... in civilian trucks .
civilian trucks?
man , i'm hungry .
you just ate five minutes ago .
what if i go in the back and get a slice of cheese?
you'd stop at one slice .
what does homeland defense need with a truck full of cheese anyway?
you ain't never heard of government cheese?
let's give them a little assistance .
hi , boys .
ladies .
look like you're overheated .
i know we are .
i mean your car .
i'm not going out without a fight .
he's retarded .
key's in the truck .
move the level , because the brakes get stuck .
hi , i'm agent shavers .
we'll be commandeering your truck today .
man , we can't let nobody know a white guy hijacked us .
we'll say it was 75 black guys .
we got a truck full of guns , they pay us to haul cheese?
that's not cheese?
so , what you think , d train?
this enough bang for you?
god bless america .
you're going to take the president out , aren't you , george?
no , captain , you are .
they pull the trigger , you take the fall .
no one would ever believe i ...
what?
augustus gibbons always fought the system .
this week , that fight became a war .
he took out his own nsa unit ... ... broke a convict out of a maximum security prison ... ... staged his own death , ordered the murder of jack pettibone ... ... and rallied his old troop of traitors for one last stand .
i believe it .
you know what your problem is , auggie?
you've never been able to see beyond the bend .
and you've never been able to see beyond yourself .
you've had your hero's funeral , gibbons .
this time , they're gonna bury you in a pine box in an unmarked grave .
i'm not buried yet .
he's one man , captain .
what can one man do?
deckert's got all the streets locked down .
three blocks in every direction .
there are some streets he don't know about .
at the east capitol and eighth street ... ... we use alleys and warehouses to bust out behind the capitol .
gonna have tanks waiting .
leave the tanks to me .
if it got wheels , we can jack it .
trust me , daddy o .
all right , let's roll .
all right , gentlemen .
lock and load .
time to ride out .
the fate of the free world in the hands of a bunch of hustlers and thieves .
why should tonight be any different?
as you can see behind me , the president is just arriving ...
the nation is eager to hear the president's stance on pressing issues .
chief among them , the new military bill .
ladies and gentlemen , the president of the united states .
<i>mr .
speaker, </ i> <i>my fellow americans ... </ i> ... tonight i stand before you to report ... ... that the state of our union is strong .
<i>we are at a critical moment</ i> <i>in our history . </ i>
nice .
get crunk , x. come on , steele , get crunk with us .
we now need the courage to reevaluate ... ... the course of modern american democracy ... ... if we are to truly flourish and survive .
looks like we got a little block party up ahead .
go through it .
hold on .
we must use understanding ... ... and compassion ...
they're shooting at us .
welcome to the 'hood , college boy . ... and compromise to win battles ...
... and not just the sacrifices ... ... of the lives of our young men and women .
fellas ... ... i don't mean to be a back seat driver ... ... but isn't that a dead end?
there's no such thing as a dead end .
now , that's what i'm talking about !
oh , shit .
i think you might wanna back up right about now .
go , go , go .
everybody out now .
i told you they'd have tanks waiting .
and i told you ... ... if it got wheels , we can jack it .
move it .
get those jacks out of there .
welcome to the first tank jacking in history .
we can and must endeavor ... ... to win the hearts and minds of our enemies ... ... and turn them into our allies .
and so , my fellow americans ... ... i will ask you tonight to support this new ...
what's going on?
we need to move you .
remain in your seats .
no cause for alarm .
okay , let's put these dubs to work .
you sure you know how to drive this thing?
just trying to get a feel for her .
yeah !
i could get used to this .
you know , somebody better leave a note .
okay , split off the vice president .
what are you doing?
just following protocol , sir .
we're in position .
<i>code red .
code red . </ i>
<i>small arms fire , capitol building . </ i>
<i>all units respond immediately . </ i>
all right , zeke , the tank is all yours .
hey , you know what to do .
i'll take lead , you lay down cover .
what do you mean you'll take lead?
i'm xxx .
is this you , george?
are you doing this?
are you familiar with the word " treason "?
you're a jefferson man .
the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time ... ... with the blood of patriots .
and tyrants .
that's the end of the quote .
i will do whatever it takes to keep this nation safe and strong .
compassion?
understanding?
what world are you living in?

<i>you should have seen it coming . </ i>
give up while you still can , george .
it's over .
things not going according to plan?
sir?
sergeant , sidearm .
we'll fall back to the train .
captain , he's got to have a backup .
what would it be?
there's a presidential bullet train ... ... three stories down for emergency evacuation .

we'll take care of this .
sergeant .

the man that tried to save the president but failed?
i'll be seen as a patriot .
tried to save the president but ...

brakes are blown .
i can't slow down .
