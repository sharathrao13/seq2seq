you're my designated hitter .
i need you to step up into the batter's box ... ... and knock one out of the ballpark for me .

you ever have a nickname?
well , it was ...
squirt .
the squirt .
something about how i was conceived , i don't know .
we gonna think of something .
have trouble finding the place?
no , sir .
by the way , what a absolutely beautiful hou ...
home you have .
if she thinks she's getting that yacht , she's a little dingy .
he always ...
he loves that one .
the point is that we need somebody ... ... who projects confidence in this position .
we've seen how you handle yourself .
you've been a great cheerleader for this company .
so we were thinking that ...
well , you go ahead and tell him .
no , you go ahead .
what's up , guys?
come on .
don't hold out on me here .
what?
we want you to go on moneylife this afternoon ... ... and announce our quarterly projections .
you're the guy .
you're the guy we have faith in .
you can get our positive spin out there .
right .
positive spin .
these are fickle times , dick .
we need to stick together as a team .
like my daddy always used to say ...
well , you can count on me , sir .
i mean , i can't tell you how happy i am .
thank you .
how were those eggs florentine?
best i've ever had .
good answer .
i'm on the plane right now !
do you know what's sitting in front of me?
do you know?
a kosher meal !
a kosher meal !
how many times do i need to tell you? !
i don't need a kosher meal !
i'm episcopalian !
no ...
no , you , miss ...
you ...
no , you grow up !
for ...
no , you , miss ...
phyilis , can i?
can i talk to you for a minute?
here's a yell !
it's personal .
never actually had makeup on .
i'm happy for you .
hi .
hi .
where's sam?
washington .
these are your talking points .
they were just faxed over .
and sam is on the line for you .
hello .
mr. harper .
hey , sam .
how you doing?
nice talking to you .
i thought you were gonna be here .
me too .
i hear it's beautiful there .
that's the thing ...
okay , dick , we're on in five .
yep , sure . three , two ...
today we're talking with the new vp of communications at globodyne ... ...
dick harper .
how you doing , dick?
just terrific , sam .
thank you for asking .
and so is globodyne , by the way .
now , dick , tell me , what is the shareholder to make ... ... of the fact that jack mccallister , your ceo ... ... has unloaded a considerable share of his stocks?
i think ceos sell their stocks for many reasons , sam .
both professional and personal .
actually , over the past year , jack mccallister has sold 80 percent ... ... of his holdings through shell companies .
now , how do you explain that?
the reasons for doing something like that would be ...
losing you there .
hold on .
the reasons for doing something like that would be ...
could be many .
both ...
there's also talk of some of the globodyne portfolio documents ... ... being subpoenaed .
specifically those of your cfo , frank bascombe .
now , joining us with his insights , is presidential hopeful ralph nader .
really?
hi , ralph .
big fan , love your stuff .
i wish i could say the same .
i don't know how you sleep at night .
corporations like globodyne pervert the american dream .
the super rich get richer .
you are a disgrace .
ralph , i don't know where you're getting your statistics .
i can only say that , in my estimation , globodyne is transparent .
we'd be more than willing to share any and all documentation .
what is going on?
can somebody tell me what the heck is ...?
hey , there's a fi ...
somebody should ...
okay .
this can't be good .
out of my way !
hey , that's my ficus !
my ficus !
you're not even from this floor !
help !
security !
what's going on?
oh , so dick finally wants to know what's going on .
frank?
methinks somebody made a boo boo .
maybe we didn't know how to use quicken .
yeah , that could be it .
frank .
frank .
try to focus .
okay?
what's happening to globodyne?
globodyne?
yeah , what happened , frank?
we took our shifting losses ...
yeah? ... and we put them into businesses ...
yeah , yeah? ... that we actually owned .
and then the balance sheet ... ... it showed profit .
but actually , there was ... ... debt .
what the hell? !
you're sick .
i want you to hit me .
frank , let go of me now .
i want you to hit me .
let go , you're scaring me .
hit me .
frank !
get off !
and i have the 6000 greatest partners a man could ask for .
mr. mccallister?
i don't know what to tell you .
we're just a cell in a much larger organism called the global economy .
weak companies have to die so that stronger companies can get stronger .
it's just nature .
nature?
what?
you ever read walden pond?
it's all in there .
hey , you send him a copy of the tape .
what about the other employees , sir?
they're gonna be fine .
don't go there .
this is america , the land of opportunity .
i don't know , sir .
with all due respect , this doesn't feel right .
step away from the rotors now , boy .
they gonna chop your head clean off .
honey?
i'm home .
oh , and the vice president is home !
i see you got them digging the hot tub .

no .
oh , boy .
and now , you know what ... ... i can spend so much more time with my beautiful boy .
yeah .
now , what's your news , big mr. vp?
i have something of an announcement to make .
it turns out that a very wonderful opportunity has just presented itself ... ... in the form of me ... ... not necessarily working at globodyne anymore .
were you fired?
i wasn't fired .
globodyne tanked .
dick !
jeez .

what do you mean?
how could that happen?
they just gave you a promotion .
and ...
there is nothing to worry about .
i'll get my severance ... ... money from my pension .

i am a winner .
billy , tell your father he's a winner .

i'm sorry , i don't remember where you know me from .

oh , my god , that was great .
hey , some of the fellas would like to meet you .
hello , dick .
i can't believe it's really you .
oh , my god , it's him .

we have an expression around here when someone makes a mistake .
it's called " pulling a dick .
up high , up high .
have you seen dickharperlsatool . com?
oh , you're gonna love this .
this is dynamite .
i don't know where you're getting your statistics .

we couldn't hire you !
we just wanna take your picture .
okay , everybody , little bit closer .
one , two , three .

hey , how'd it go?
oh , not too bad .
it was good practice .
what are you doing?
going through our finances .
i'm not sure ... ... but it seems that we may be in a little bit of a pickle , dick .
well , sure , our financial bounce back has taken a bit longer than expected ... ... but , you know , that's natural .
our lawn was repossessed today .
i didn't even know they could do that .
i think maybe it's time you start thinking about accepting something ... ... a little bit lower than a vice presidency .
no .
took me 15 years to get a vp ship .
if i step back now ... ... l'll lose everything i worked for .
we're just gonna have to suck it up for a couple months .
in a couple of months , we'll be declaring bankruptcy .
oh , come on .
our savings ...
look .
our savings was in globodyne stock .
jesus .
and , look , our pension was in globodyne stock .
everything was in globodyne stock !
all of it !
the lawn is covered with dirt !
it is so much fun !
i have made a mud man !
now , billy is looking at the glass half full .
hon , relax .
we've got 600 grand .
where?
we're standing in it .
our house .
since globodyne , the local property market crashed , dick .
if we sold our house today , we would owe the bank 150 grand .
i knew it .
it was churning in my gut ... ... and i didn't listen .
it would be okay .
you said we could afford this house and take out a second mortgage ... ... so that we could put in the pool , redo the kitchen ...
i said that . ... and now we are on the verge ... ... of losing the house .
if we lose the house ... ... then billy loses all sense of security and later , never have a relationship ... ... so he'll just spend his whole life just alone .
there he'll be , just alone , nobody with him , just like a bum .
hon?
hon?
you need a paper bag?
you said everything was gonna be okay .
mr. dick !
something wrong with the electricity !
well , if you're gonna do it , be the best .

you guys are my kind of peeps .
captains of industry , masters of the universe ... ... presidents of hair club for men .
that's a nice piece of hair .
you can't even see the tread marks .
this squirrel died of natural causes .
excuse me , pardon me .
i gotta get to the " toppytip " of the financial summit .
isn't anyone going to do anything?
this happens every week .
this guy actually isn't that bad .
i'm a corporate puppet .
and i'm gonna need some more string ... ... so i can go on believing i'll be a real boy someday ... ... without being manipulated ...
no , no , no , i got it . ... by the bullshit !
oh , my god , dick .

dick , hi .
long time no see .
frank !
frank !
i'm gonna get him .
just ...
frank , where are you going?
dick !
come on , frank .
i just wanna have a talk .
hey there , frankie .
how do you like those eggs florentine?
wait , wait , wait !
wait , it was jack .
it was jack .
he siphoned off all of globodyne's assets ... ... and then he dumped the stock .
it was his plan from the beginning .
son of a bitch !
that fucker !
hon , language .
she's right .
when you get out of prison ... ... you'll get $20 million to keep your mouth shut .
no , 10 .
you think i could have gotten 20?
you son of a b ...
you'll break ...
dick .
i want him .
let go .
don't you think i feel terrible?
why do you think i'm drinking myself to death?
instead of drinking , why don't you do something about it .
yeah , frank .
sometimes the cure is a clean conscience .
that is good .
thanks , hon .
i just thought of it .
you did?
yeah .
you're right .
you're right .
help me up .
help me up .
yeah , help me up .
i gotta think of something .
okay , just give me a minute .
just give me ...
hey .
hey !
not this time , frank .
i'm sorry , i'm sorry , i'm sorry .
it's force of habit .
i know a way .
i know a way .
but it's really , really risky .
that's where jack keeps it .
four hundred million in highly liquid u. s. bearer bonds .
so it's a vault job .
go in after midnight , bypass security ... ... and ... power tools .
it's a little simpler than that .
power tools?
jack's gonna have to take those bonds out of the safe deposit box .
that should be fun for him .
here's my babies .
so , what's he gonna do with the money?
there it is , the grand cayman bank .
grand cayman .
what is this place?
it's where rich people go to evade taxes .
bastards .
honey .
they can't hear us .
what's next?
mccallister takes the bonds to a representative ... ... who asks him for his signature to verify what they call " membership .
once the bonds are counted and confirmed ... ...
mccallister will receive a crm 114 deposit form ... ... and on this form he inputs his account number ... ... that only he and the bank know .
then the agent will take this ... ... to an authorization officer for further verification .
once the representative has stamped and initialed the document ... ... the account rep will take the crm 114 ... ... back to mccallister for final approval before finalization .
you said this was gonna be simple .
can you explain it again?
jane doesn't seem to understand .
jane , it's simple .
it's so simple .
jeez .
now , listen .
all we have to do ... ... is switch mccallister's crm 114 with his account number ... ... with one of our own .
i'm so sorry .
a copy that we have made ... ... that has a number from an account that i have established .
and jack sends the 400 million to us without knowing it .
that's ...
you got it .
it's so simple .
that is beautiful .
it's a switch .
it's a switch .
it's a switch .
it's a switch .
that's so sexy , man .
that's unbelievable .
it'll be fun .
but jane's gonna have to do it .
because if mccallister sees either one of us , he'll know something's up .
and i?
do nothing .
i can do that .
yeah .
okay .
you do it , then .
you're the one .
yeah .
yeah .
you could do it , except ...
no , it's good .
no , you do it .
you do it .
you do it .
you deserve to do it .
honey ...
are you ready to make the switch?
do you have the form?
it's right here .
we should practice the move .
no , i got it .
okay , fine .
i won't be involved .
i won't participate at all .
you do it .
it's all you .
let's do one for good luck .
i got dressed up .
you're not doing me any favors .
get out of the car !
i just think it's important .
that's all .
okay , i'll be the bank representative .
and you be you .
hey .
hey !
wait , sir .
no !
no , no .
no !
sorry .
everybody ready?
no .
what?
well , dick lost the form .
so ...
what?
do you have an extra copy?
do you have any idea what i went through to get that? !
oh , let me guess , a fifth of scotch !
you son of a ...
wait .
stop it .
knock it off !
my god .
wait a second .
can we get another one?
is that possible?
how can we do that?
you know what , i'm gonna take the car ... ... and i'm gonna try to delay mccallister .
he's here .
he's here .
oh , god .
what are you ...?
i'm going .
that was not cool .
okay .
it's very simple .
i got it .
i got it .
it's very simple .
what?
go into the bank .
go into the office of the client relations coordinator .
the document forms are backed up on her disk , you have to print one out .

mr. mccallister , please .
i don't know .
i think i made a mistake .

we got one situation here , now , fellas ... ... which is that that number wrong .
that's incorrect right there .
did he see us?
i have no idea .
i think he saw you .
i think he saw you .
you were sticking your big head out there .
i gotta hit the road here , fellas , so i'm gonna sign this for you ... ... then you gonna change it .
yes .
oh , man .

jack , hey .
it was great seeing you .
where's frank bascombe?

you didn't think i'd catch that , now , did you?
what do you mean?
here's what you're gonna do .
you're gonna turn around and march out of here now .
you're gonna take goldilocks there with you .
and i won't put the two of you in prison for a very long time .
actually , honey , i think that sounds pretty good .
i think ...
i think we should take it , you know .
you think so , hon?
i do .
because i don't .
dick harper .
i've been terminated , bankrupted , deported and blackmailed ... ... because of you .
and i'm not leaving here without your money .
what you gonna do , dick?
shoot me if i don't approve that form?
write me a check .
you are kidding me .
dick , it's not gonna do us any good .
he's just gonna cancel it the minute we walk out of here .
i don't care .
i don't care .
i'm not walking out of this bank empty handed .
all right .
all right , dick , i'm gonna write you a check .
i'm gonna need my hand back .
gladly .
all right .
yes , sir .
i'm gonna write you that check .
and what's more , i'm not gonna cancel it .
because i think it takes a lot of cojones ... ... to do what you two have done here today .
and i admire that .
so ... ... here you go .
just a little something to show you what i think you're worth .
y'all take care , now .
dick , honey ... ... give me the squirt gun , okay?
do you still have mccallister's form?
why?
because i just got his signature .
weren't you an art major?
dick harper !
i had no idea what you were doing .
i was completely fooled .
my god , i didn't know you could act .
hon , in 10th grade i played biff in death of a salesman .
come on .
that's just ...
see the way i got my eyes watering up?
yes , sir .
it's all right there .
i am married to a genius .
it's a turn on , isn't it?
you're a criminal .
i'm a hardened criminal .
hon , first we need to talk to spencer .
right .
are you in the habit of signing things without looking at them?
miss sheinkopf?
miss sheinkopf , i'm gonna be home by 6 .
mr. mccallister !
jack !
mr. mccallister !
mr. mccallister !
we're all waiting for you over here , jack .
everybody's really pumped .
come on !
is this some kind of a joke , dick?
are you still trying to get even with me?
why would i get even with such a generous man?
i still can't believe you did that .
jane and i were way off base .
he's on in 20 , right?
hook him up .
wait , on what?
sam samuels .
moneylife .
oh , and here are some suggested responses .
live to southern california , where ... ... in a stunning act of personal generosity , jack mccallister ...
who the hell do you think you are?
i'm your vp of communications , jack . personally funded the defunct corporation's pension fund .
you said i just did what?
god , i love this guy .
but seriously , jack , what made you do it?
well , i ...
sam , i ...
i realized , sam , that since the employees of globodyne ... ... had given me so much , it was time for me to give back to them .
so yesterday , i wire transferred ... ... $400 million ... ... into the newly created globodyne pension relief fund .
oh , yeah !
let's look at what happened when the first ex globodyne employees ... ... received their shares of money .
many people had their life savings invested in the company ... ... and were delighted to learn their pensions had been returned .
it is the first time in u. s. corporate history ... ... that a ceo has personally funded a bankrupted pension plan .
this incredible gesture won't soon be forgotten by the people ... ... whose lives it has so dramatically affected .
and this is just the beginning .
in the coming months , thousands more will be receiving a check ... ... for the full value of their lost pensions and life savings .
jack , jack , he's got your back !
jack , jack , he's got your back !
jack , jack , he's got your back !
you hear that?
they love you , jack .
now , go to hell .
mr. mccallister ... ... do you consider yourself a modern day robin hood?
does this mean you're off the hook?
do you wanna save the whales?
now , hang on a minute .
have you decided to contribute to the homeless?
what made you so gracious?
mr. mccallister , how do you feel right now?
mr. mccallister , how about giving a brother a buck?
look at our beautiful family .
my name is dick harper .
i agree .
hey , harpers , stick them up !
look who it is .
hey , garth .
how you doing , garth?
great .
hey , how do you like the new wheels?
nice .
hooked up with a new company .
great benefits .
yeah?
yeah .
