i'll think of something .
# there she goes
# there she goes again
# racing through my brain
# and i just can't contain
# this feeling that remains
# there she goes
# there she goes again
# rushing through my veins
# and i just can't contain
# this feeling that remains
# there she goes
# there she goes
# there she goes #
i'm ms hughes .
it's not miss , it's not mrs.
ms , ok?
practise?
say it after me .
ms hughes .
come on .
ms hughes .
fine .
don't forget .
right , i'm gonna start off today by telling you a few things i like and a few things i don't like .
yeah , all right .
all right .
all right , that's enough football .
now , " of mice and men " .
how many of you managed to , uh , get all the way through it?
steven , you've got your hand in the air .
you've not read it?
yes , sir .
what happens in the end?
he shoots him , sir .
who shoots who?
the little bloke shoots the big bloke .
he's right , sir .
i'm leaving because there's no point carrying on .
lf i've got steven downing to read a book , there's no challenges left .
my career can only go downhill .
better be about the book , robert .
no , sir .
it's about alan smith .
yeah , well , later .
what about him?
mr ashworth , have you got a moment?
sorry , but the noise from here makes it impossible to concentrate next door .
you'll get used to it .
i don't want to get used to it .
i want to do some work , not listen to moronic football chanting .
qulet !
out !
out !
hold your hands up in the air !
offside !
linesman !
you're the linesman !
my god !
right , clap .
show he's done the right thing .
we don't have linesmen , sir .
applaud the referee , then .
jesus , doesn't matter .
that'll do for today .
right .
see you tomorrow , sarah .
all right .
i was the naive , stupid new teacher , you were the cynical old hand?
what?
the snorting when i asked a question .
i was reading the football reports .
i never listen at staff meetings .
this has got to be a pose , this football stuff .
you pretend to be a yob for a bit of street cred?
ls this 'cause my kids were enjoying their lesson?
well , all kids enjoy a riot .
actually teaching them something is a lot harder !
i've seen this film .
you end up shagging on the carpet .
lf we end up shagging on the carpet ,
i will buy you a new carpet .
yeah , right .
but i tell you ...
i knew it !
no .
no carpets .
he is an english teacher .
oh , god , not all this again .
i mean , what about patrick swayze?
no one cares whether he read byron or not .
and you know , he is the full axminster .
i'd want a brain as well .
eventually .
i'm gonna measure up .
i'm off to habitat first thing .
lf we end up shagging , you can carpet the whole house .
the walls , the ceiling , the garden ...
well , what's she like?
one of those women if you like football , you must be a yob .
bollocks .
ls she fit?
not that you'd prove her point or anything .
what?
what?
what have i done?
it's a perfectly reasonable , straightforward question .
she's not unattractive , but so what?
a ) she hates me , b ) i hate her , and c ) what's the point of all that?
waste of fucking time .
ooh , sounds promising , then .
it must be terrible being that miserable .
pretending you only care about football results because the world's a terrible place and what's the point of it all?
what ls the point?
maybe it ls football results .
don't worry .
he's a sad , lonely bastard .
who cares what made him that way?
where's your brother?
eh?
he's over there .
oi , number nine !
you're a donkey !
didn't he have a trial with someone once?
yeah .
orient .
they offered him a contract , as well .
what happened?
turned it down .
stupid sod .
said it was too risky .
what's he doing now?
er , runs his own business .
computer something .
he's on about fifty grand a year .
i'd swap fifty grand a year
for a contract with orient .
so would l .
don't even like orient .
neither do l .
he gets it both ways .
gets fifty grand a year , gets to play at a place with floodlights .
floodlights and a tea bar .
i'd love to play at a place with a tea bar .
yeah , well ...
bit late now , eh?
dunno .
stanley matthews played first division football till he was fifty .
bet you any money you like
you're not playing first division football
when you're fifty .
it's the smoking .
it's not the smoking , steve , it's the crapness .
pass the ball !
penalty !
yes !
hold that .
i've always wanted to do this .
# la la la la la la la
# la la la la la la la

anthropologists have always had a hard time with football .
the trouble is , you can only see what's on the outside .
but there ls an inside , believe it or not .
we all have our reasons for loving things the way we do .
hey !
he's here !
thanks for being so helpful .
ready?
he's been ready for hours .
no , i haven't .
yes , you have .
what time will you be back?
er , six .
six thirty .
fine .
see you later , then .
ok?
have a nice time .
see you later , sunshine .
we'll do something special next time , huh?
you looking forward to it?
what?
the match .
yeah .
sounds like it .
i'm not really a football fan .
no .
one day we'll find something you do wanna do .
your mum seems in good form .
yeah .
she ok?
not really .
the last home game , last season?
what about it?
they were fucking rubbish .
fucking rubbish last year and the year before .
they'll be fucking rubbish this year , too .
and next year .
and the year after that .
i don't know why you come , frank .
you live in hope .
what d'you reckon?
think they're bad as frank says?
this is his first time .
hope he knows what he's lettin 'himself in for .
have a look at the number eight .
jon sammels .
remember his face and if you happen to bump into him , tell him to sod off to spurs !
programmes !
programmes !
go on , give it a shove .
someone hasn't been eating their greens .
wey hey !
we're in " y " , ok?
yeah .
what d'you reckon?
when's the next game?
week after next , probably .
let's have a look .
yeah , sunderland .
they're away at leeds next week .
can we come to the sunderland game , dad?
you might wanna go somewhere different .
lf you're gonna be a football fan , think carefully about who you're gonna follow .
look .
for fuck's sake , arsenal !
get it !
sammels , you're a fucking idiot !
sort yourself out !
that was a brilliant goal , wasn't it , dad?
it was pretty good , yeah .
what happened?
it was a penalty , the goalie saved it then the man who missed the penalty had another go and scored .
terry neill?
that's right .
he's good , isn't he?
fantastic .
i'm off , then .
see you next week .
let's go .
come on .
why do we have to leave?
beat the traffic .
long walk back to the car , we'll be stuck for hours .
but they might score again .
there's a remote possibility .
but it won't be this afternoon .
joke . lf you're an arsenal fan , you get used to jokes like that .
i will .
who d'you think played best?
dunno .
but sammels was rubbish .
i don't think so .
crowd didn't understand what he was trying to do .
they were on to him before he'd done anything wrong .
i disagree .
oh , you do?
one afternoon at football , you're kenneth wolstenholme .
who did you think played the best?
might make an arsenal defence of them yet , robert .
yes , sir .
em , sir , you going to highbury next week?
nah .
oh .
'course i'm going .
want me to get you a programme?
it's cash in advance .
i've been caught too many times .
no , it's not that .
em ... could i come with you?
that'd be a bit difficult .
to be honest , between you and me ,
i go to the pub first .
i could wait outside .
i stand on the north bank .
you wouldn't see .
i'd go down the front .
your mum'd love that .
she says i have to go with a responsible adult .
saturday's the one day of the week when i'm not a responsible adult .
i turn into someone your age .
not as sensible .
she won't have to find out .
i'm sorry , robert , i can't .
well , not this week .
maybe some other time , eh?
next season when you've grown a bit?
get you a programme .
cash in advance unnecessary , on this occasion .
to hell with it , you can have one for free .
thanks , sir .
bollocks !
bollocks !
nothing to worry about .
his handwriting's a disgrace to the human race but he's very bright and enjoys the lessons .
he does .
he's always goin 'on about you .
it's my enthusiasm for steinbeck's prose style .
either that or something else .
the football , you mean?
robert thinks they might win the championship for the first time since 1 970 .
1 971 .
gotta get things like that right .
absolutely .
did he tell you what happened after football training?
he asked me if i'd take him to the arsenal .
mr ashworth , i'm so sorry .
he just seemed uptight about it .
his dad and me are recently separated .
it was his dad he used to go with .
you don't wanna take him?
don't know anything about it .
i very much doubt if he'd care .
i can tell you everything you need to know in about five minutes .
she seemed to enjoy the elizabethans but when we moved on , she slipped back .
she dropped four places .
was it four?
no , six .
which i found a little disappointing though i'm not sure that she did .
no .
she's got her heart set on a hairdresser's apprenticeship .
right .
thanks very much , then .
you come out the tube station , cross over the street and in that entrance there , you buy unreserved seats , 7 .
my ex can pay .
he's a spurs fan , isn't he?
yeah .
i'd go for 1 2 seats .
sting the bastard for all you can get .
thank you so much .
you've been really helpful .
hello , mr johnson .
how are you?
evening .
suppose you're feeling pretty pleased with life .
# are you ready to be ... heartbroken?
oh , fuck it !
# well , you better get ready now , baby
would you like a lift?
# get ready to bleed
you don't know where i live .
yes , i do .
crouch end .
it's on my way home .
'don't forget , i'll be back
'with all the top sports stories ...
'but first of all ... '
how about you?
arsenal .
lnside the stadium or just nearby?
'number one ,
'abigail's party ,
you really are mr popular , aren't you?
all those queues at your desk . '.. live commentary
'on three races from that meeting . '
sorry .
'and the main one at 3 . 45 .
'now the main sports stories . '
what were you talking to robert parker's mother about? '.. suspended arsenal's paul davis ... '
shit !
fuck !
bollocks !
i'm sorry?
paul davis .
who's paul davis?
arsenal .
were we talking about him? '.. signed a four year contract ... '
sorry .
i wasn't listening . '.. olympic headlines from seoul ,
'linford christie's given the all clear ... '
arsenal .
yes , you said .
no , i was talking to robert parker's mother about arsenal .
god !
i'm in the wrong job .
well , i'm in the wrong life .
i spent hours preparing for a parents 'evening .
no one could think of two words to say to me .
yet they queue for hours to hear your pearls of wisdom on next week's game against wolves united !
yeah ...
just wolves .
no united .
look , i'm sorry .
it must seem unfair .
yes , it does , actually .
it's the next left .
maybe you're too uptight with them .
maybe you should just ... be yourself more .
all those files and folders and what have you .
that ls me being myself .
it's just here .
d'you want a cup of coffee?
ok .
you don't have to .
no , no , no .
i'd ...
yeah , i'd like to .
what are these for , then?
they're not for anything .
they just look nice .
are they yours?
no .
jo's .
my flat mate .
it's her place .
she's away at the moment .
can i smoke?
no .
you can stay the night , though , if you want .
not on the carpet .
i can't afford it .
you might have the decency to run .
then we wouldn't be doing it together .
cocky cow .
it's just a fact .
look .
ok !
ok !
i hate you !
i owe you a new carpet .
well , maybe a new spare bed .
you shagged the football hooligan !
i knew it !
i knew it !
he's not a football hooligan .
so he has read byron?
he's bound to have done !
it doesn't really matter if he hasn't .
who'd have thought it , eh?
lron knickers " hughes ending up with a yob .
he's not a yob and i'm not ending up with him .
you wanna bet?
where are you off to?
i'm starving .
i was thinking of ringing for a pizza .
have you read byron?
what?
have you read any of byron's poems?
yeah .
the assyrian came down like a wolf on the fold
and his somethings were gleaming
in black and old gold . " crap .
what are those?
my ... arsenal boxer shorts .
they're not my best ones .
i was running out .
but you're willing to show them to another human being .
i wasn't exactly showing them to you .
what d'you wanna know about byron for?
um ... a bet .
did you win?
i don't think so .
stay in line !
right , now push up !
out !
out !
that's it !
good lads .
offside , referee !
offside !
ref !
oi , ref , he was miles off .
it's not m y fault .
too good a coach for this level .
what's the score?
one all .
lf you count that poxy goal they just scored .
what's this , cup or league?
cup , quarter final .
how long left?
fifteen .
i wanted to talk to you about a vacancy .
rosie hunter's handed in her notice .
i wondered whether you'd be interested in applying .
head of year?
um ... well ...
obviously not the most attractive offer you've ever had .
come on , ben !
get back with him !
sorry , ted .
i haven't fired you with enthusiasm .
it's a lot of work .
what do i wanna do more work for?
more money?
i've got enough to pay my rent , enough for my season ticket and a couple of records a month .
got no family .
i'd like you to think about it .
sorry .
there's nothing to think about .
come on , sam !
put it away !
yes !
why aren't adults supposed to go mad about anything?
you've got to keep a lid on it .
and if you don't , then people are apparently entitled to say what they like .
you haven't grown up , you're a moron .
your conversation is trivial and boorish .
you can't express your emotional needs .
you can't relate to your children and you die lonely and miserable .
but you know , what the hell?
every cloud has a silver lining .
not on your own .
how many more times?
you'll have to wait until your father's over .
so i'll get to highbury five times a year?
it's not my fault your father lives abroad .
mum , they play 21 times a year plus cup matches .
that's ...
mum , why is crossroads a motel?
what d'you mean?
why isn't it just a hotel?
29 ! lf they get to the league cup semi final , the fa cup quarter final ...
you can take your car there .
you forgot europe .
i don't know how many games last season .
oh , yeah .
that's another five games .
that hotel in devon , we took our car .
every round is home and away .
we had to leave it in the car park .
fives into thirty five goes seven .
one seventh of all the home games .
pathetic !
paul , in a motel , you drive a car into a room !
say you only went to one seventh your choral society
they'd throw you out .
arsenal won't throw you out .
they want your money .
i've looked it up .
i can catch the 1 2 . 53 to paddington , be at paddington by 1 . 36 , get the circle and district and metropolitan line to kings cross .
then it's caledonian road , holloway road ,
arsenal , third stop .
be there 2 . 1 5 , easy .
for christ's sake , go if you want to .
yes !
thanks , mum .
charlie , charlie ,
charlie , charlie ,
charlie's the king of highbury .
don't come runnin 'to me if you get stabbed to death .
i won't .
jimmy husband !
brilliant .
it's not easy to become a football fan .
it takes years .
but if you put in the hours , you're welcomed , without question , into a new family .
except in this family , you care about the same people and hope for the same things .
what's childish about that?
a terrible foul by mclintock on rocastle .
he'll be lucky to stay on the pitch .
it wasn't that bad .
it was mistiming , it wasn't malicious .
bollocks !
so , that's a free kick to 1 989 arsenal and ... davis takes it .
and ...
goal !
and that's 1 989 arsenal four , 1 971 arsenal , nil .
bob wilson will be bitterly disappointed with that one .
this lot would never beat the double team four nil at subbuteo .
it's just i'm crap at it !
should've chosen someone else .
who else played in yellow and blue away strip?
everton?
be everton , then .
ok .
but this game's abandoned .
i can't start suddenly pretending that john radford's joe royle .
it'd do my head in .
have to start again .
nil nil .
all right .
go on , then .
yes !
what are you thinking about?
oh ... stuff .
what stuff?
i was thinking about dh lawrence , actually .
yeah?
what about him?
well ...
well ... about his books .
what about his books?
just ... which one's the longest .
and?
l i couldn't remember .
well , which one did you think it might be?
that's just it .
i couldn't decide .
between what and what?
mm ...
well , " lady chatterley's lover " ...
and ...?
and , um ...
i wasn't thinking about dh lawrence at all .
you amaze me .
i was thinking about arsenal .
i'm staggered .
we might win the league this year .
we're half way through the season and we're top and they'll fuck it up but ...
you're not impressed , are you?
i am .
i hope they win the league .
it's just that ...
why did you lie?
i've got to vary the answers .
i can't say arsenal every time .
i can't find any ... " bread " .
do i look like the sort of man who'd have a " bread " album?
no , you look like the kind of man who has a " bollock brothers " album .
i wouldn't put that on .
it's a bit ... not the right mood .
oh?
and what's the right mood?
well , i don't know , just ... something ... you know .
what?
you know , just ... something not as ... sweary and loud .
paul , that's the most romantic thing you've ever said to me .
shut up .
by the way , congratulations .
on what?
two nil .
quinn and dixon .
goal in each half .
top of the league .
nine games to go .
george graham sees no reason why arsenal shouldn't bring the title back to highbury for the first time in 1 6 years .
1 8 years .
i'm sure he said 1 6 .
oh , right .
maybe i'm wrong .
yeah , ok , ok .
1 8 .
whatever .
so , when does it all end?
may .
and what happens then , in the summer?
just sit in the park and wait for the fixture list to come out .
so what about this summer?
that's a good point .
we might be in the charity shield .
that isn't the point i was making .
we've been ... seeing each other well , we've been sleeping together for six months now .
and we've never even planned a holiday together .
it's a miracle if we plan a weekend before friday afternoon .
and yet you know what arsenal are doing for months in advance .
they produce a fixture list .
well , i can do that for you .
give me your diary and i'll put some dates in it .
don't be daft .
what's daft about it?
i don't really see the difference .
how about saturday , october the 8th?
let's go away somewhere .
i haven't got next season's fixture list yet .
you know you're seeing arsenal next year .
you can't say whether you'll be seeing me .
so what?
everyone's like that .
you know you'll be seeing your sister next season .
sisters don't have seasons .
whatever .
look , i know where this is going and you're dead wrong .
i'm capable of commitment and all that stuff .
lf it doesn't happen with you , that's because of you , not me .
21 years i've been going to arsenal .
21 years .
paul , i don't know whether you've noticed but arsenal are a football team .
and you think there's a difference?
yes , i do .
that shows what you know about it .
'shortly before kick off . '
that looked like rocky .
jo , go back to the news a minute .
it's only the local news .
i know .
it looked like rocky .
who looked like rocky?
who the hell is rocky?
doesn't matter .
we've missed it now .
that " rocky " is an arsenal player .
yeah , david rocastle .
and how do you know what he looks like?
well , i don't know .
it sinks in after a while .
what else has sunk in?
d'you know where they are in the championship cup and who their best goal hanger is?
i'm not turning into a moron .
ok , i know they're top of the league .
that's easy to remember .
and i know that alan " smudger " smith has scored most of the goals .
but it doesn't ...
i'm going next week .
you're going?
yeah .
to a football match?
yeah .
i thought i should .
ooh .
i tell you , girl , you'd better watch yourself .
soon after tim and i split up ,
i woke up one morning and realised i could remember his batting average for the previous season .
harmless enough , isn't it?
no !
it's all a sinister form of male manipulation .
rubbish !
it's true !
you get colonised .
your native culture gets driven out and it's replaced by stuff you don't even wanna know about .
they're like bloody missionaries .
they bore you stupid until you cave in then they fuck off !
shut up !
did you get it?
yes .
can i see it?
it's in me purse .
brilliant .
thanks , mum .
i've got to do an extra hour tomorrow .
left the office at twelve ,
i didn't get back till three .
they asked you what end you wanted?
no .
i said , " one , please " and they gave me that .
how comes you got a ticket in the reading end?
had to get it off a tout .
how much did that cost you?
fiver .
d'you live in lslington?
well , near , yeah .
how near is near?
place called maidenhead .
maidenhead?
maidenhead in berkshire?
two miles down the road?
more like six .
bit nearer reading than arsenal .
you should be supporting your local team .
look ...
excuse me .
just seen someone i know .
and was the ticket all right , in the end?
i was standing with a load of country bumpkins at first .
then i found jenkins and them .
so you stood with jenkins?
what would you know?
you must've been sick when they equalised .
i heard it on the radio .
the place went mad .
just had to stand and take it .
good old pat rice , though .
he never scores , pat rice .
first of the season .
we're good in the cups , aren't we?
mcnab won't play .
bertie mee wouldn't risk him .
how long will it take to get to birmingham?
couple of hours .
maybe three .
but we'll be there by two?
oh , sure .
how about if we did something different this afternoon?
how d'you mean?
i thought you might like to meet jane and the kids for lunch .
then maybe take 'em to the zoo or pictures ... somewhere .
they've been over this week visiting their grandmother .
they'd love to meet you .
you don't mean instead of the game , do you?
we couldn't do both .
you didn't get any tickets , did you?
the tickets are waiting for us there .
so you're telling me you've got tickets but you wanna go and see " the jungle book "?
you're teasing me , aren't you?
we don't have to go to arsenal every time i'm in london , do we?
i thought we were beyond that stage .
we'll never be beyond that stage .
# out here in the fields
# i fight for my meals
# i get my back into my living
# i don't need to fight
# to prove i'm right
# i don't need to be forgiven
i thought you said you'd look after me .
you said you didn't need looking after .
you're gonna get your fucking heads kicked in !
gonna get your fucking heads kicked in !
fucking jump for the ball , niall !
come on , arsenal !
do you want this or not?
'everton nil , norwich nil . '
you'll get used to it .
i don't wanna get used to it .
what's going on at the liverpool/ forest game?
there's trouble or something .
they ain't kicked off yet .
there .
heard about hillsborough?
this guy was just saying .
bloke up there reckons there's people hurt .
jesus .
what happened?
i dunno .
you all right?
yeah , i'm fine .
arsenal !
arsenal !
arsenal !
arsenal !
'semi final
'between nottingham forest and liverpool
'at the hillsborough ground in sheffield .
'it's feared that at least
'were crushed to death .
'hundreds were forced on to the pitch . '
it's just so stupid .
'the liverpool manager , kenny dalglish ,
'and his opposite number , brian clough ,
'were clearly appalled by the scenes .
'there's so far nothing to suggest ... '
so stupid . '.. that what happened
'was the result of violence amongst fans . '
they must've realised something like this was gonna happen one day .
one afternoon on the north bank and you're an expert .
well , that's it , then .
that's what?
you can't go back now , can you?
'course we will .
how can you?
because ... because everyone else will .
because the game will go on .
they'll even replay this one .
this doesn't change anything .
i just don't get you .
no , i know you don't .
it's not just me you don't get .
it's any of us .
i hope the rest of them aren't as selfish and manipulative as you .
what's selfish about watching a football team?
it's all selfish , all of it !
all those stupid stories about how your mum's cats are called after great players and how she drove through the snow to get you a cup ticket .
you stopped seeing your father when you didn't need him to take you to the games any more .
and we're supposed to understand because football's football .
when we think of paul , we think of arsenal .
it makes me sick !
i hated this afternoon .
d'you wanna know why?
because if you didn't give a toss about arsenal , what are you left with?
you pay 5 to stand on a lump of concrete .
you can't see anything , you're not even safe .
and you can't complain because that would be letting the lads down .
that'd show you didn't care enough .
well , at least we care about something .
at least we're not in night after night worrying about our lesson plans .
whether a scale 3 might come up in bournemouth .
perhaps one day you'll learn to care about something you can't tick .
thanks .
i'm sorry .
football has meant too much to me and come to represent too many things .
after a while , it all gets mixed up together in your head .
you can't remember whether
life's shit because arsenal's shit or the other way round .
i've been to watch far too many games , spent far too much money .
fretted about arsenal when i should have been fretting about something else .
i've asked too much of the people i love .
ok , i accept all that .
perhaps it's something you can't understand unless you belong .
but what about this ...?
three minutes to go and you're two one up in a semi final .
you look around and see thousands of faces contorted with fear and hope and worry .
everyone lost .
everything else gone out of their heads .
then the whistle blows and everyone goes spare .
and just for those few minutes , you're at the centre of the whole world .
and the fact that you care so much , that the noise you've made has been such a crucial part of it , is what makes it special .
you've been as important as the players and if you hadn't been there , who'd have been bothered about football , really?
the great thing is , it comes round again and again .
there's always another season .
lf you lose the cup final in may , there's the third round to look forward to in january .
what's wrong with that?
it's actually pretty comforting if you think about it .
but every now and then not very often , but it happens you catch a glimpse of a world that doesn't work like that .
a world that doesn't stop in may and begin again in august .
there's some stuff that just never comes back .
and some stuff that just won't go away .
and some stuff that you couldn't ignore even if you wanted to .
hello .
'it's me . '
do you know what time it is?
'yeah , and i'm sorry . '
listen , are you pregnant?
are these for me?
yeah .
flowers .
i suppose they were , once upon a time .
thank you .
come on , jo .
oh .
and chocolates !
it's come just at the right time for me .
it's come just at the right time for me .
i was gettin 'bored with that pub and football stuff .
you can only spend so much time playing subbuteo .
having a kid's a brilliant idea .
it wasn't really an idea .
it might as well have been .
it's perfect .
it's not just the baby .
it's , you know , it's you as well .
i think we're good together .
i thought i was miss jean brodie .
i was wrong .
i've been thinking about this .
you're george graham .
the arsenal manager .
and that's good , is it?
it's brilliant .
you're careful and organised and methodical and all that .
that's why we work .
i need somebody like that .
and you need somebody like me ....
work well as a team .
not even as a team , as a club .
paul , you do talk some terrible nonsense .
it's not .
it's the truth .
it's all working out .
wife and baby , that'll do me .
who said anything about a wife?
we'd want to do it properly , wouldn't we?
liam? lf it's a boy .
the greatest arsenal player ever but it's a nice name .
better apply for the job .
what job?
rosie's head of year job .
i said no but now , brilliant .
perfect timing .
we'll need a bit more money
'cause we'll need a house .
paul ...
ted'll be pleased , anyway .
liam , brilliant .
paul ...
we could live near the ground .
it's cheap 'cause no one wants a football stadium on their doorstep .
i'd pay extra but we won't tell the estate agent .
mortgage , wife , kid cool .
paul , none of this is real .
you're behaving like a little kid .
i've been impregnated by a 1 2 year old !
oh , thanks .
thanks very much .
sorry about that .
no problem , sir .
sorry , you were saying?
paul , this is exactly what i mean .
that was just a one off .
never happened before .
i promise it won't be a regular feature of life .
paul ...
i haven't made up my mind what i'm doing about this yet .
do you understand?
yes .
no , not really .
i can't see this working out .
it's my last chance .
don't be silly .
it's just what it feels like .
are you prepared to be a one parent family?
i think if we go through with this , one of us is gonna have to be .
no , it'll be brilliant .
i don't think i've been since george eastham was in the team .
before my time .
he was a lovely player .
the sort you don't get any more .
languid and thoughtful and elegant .
you should come and watch tony adams .
how can i help , anyway?
i changed my mind about that head of year job , if it's not too late .
no .
no , excellent .
i'm very pleased .
i've had a couple of applications but i'd be glad to add your name .
thank you .
any particular reason for the change of mind?
there is , actually , yes .
er , miss , um ...
well , miss hughes is pregnant .
sarah hughes?
history?
yes , yes , of course .
um ...
well , i didn't , um ...
i mean , she ...
how does this affect you?
sorry , no .
i left a bit out .
i'm the father .
i should've told you that straight away , shouldn't l?
anyway , yes , we're having a baby .
i haven't heard this from her .
you're hearing it from me , now .
sorry , paul , i can't share your joy .
sarah's been with us five minutes and a member of staff has knocked her up !
i'm intending to marry her and everything .
we won't embarrass the school .
you already have embarrassed the school !
how on earth are we supposed to talk to kids about responsibility and contraception and ... and the rest of it when the staff themselves ...
words fail me !
i thought you'd be pleased .
about what?
the clandestine affair?
the accidental pregnancy?
not those bits , maybe , but me applying for the job .
that's good , isn't it?
are you a complete fool , paul?
i'll talk to you later .
yeah , ok , ok .
calm down .
i want you to take your foot off the gas in the second half .
what's the fun of beating a team 1 5 or 20 nil?
it's brilliant fun !
all right .
just take it easy , eh?
you're like vultures .
now go on !
come on , lads !
oh , hi .
we're winning 8 nil .
er , 9 nil .
calm down !
are you a complete fool?
you've been to see ted .
he's not best pleased with us .
who else are you gonna tell?
the kids?
we could recreate what we did in assembly .
find the durex that split and bring it in .
i could lose my job !
they can't sack you for getting pregnant .
i haven't been here long enough for maternity leave .
the union'll help .
none of this is the point , paul .
the point is ...
how many times have i told you about playing to the whistle?
call me later , ok?
see , if we ...
fuck !
fuck !
fuck !
come on , you useless shower !
this lot are crap get stuck in !
i'm not a psychologist ... but i'd suggest that taking up smoking the week you find out you're pregnant indicates a certain ambivalence towards the pregnancy on your part .
he's given up .
paul? !
mm hm .
mr first thing in the morning?
yeah .
we're both making it clear where we stand .
i start drinking and smoking and he's given everything up .
this is horrible .
i don't care how much damage it's doing to me .
so if everything's as bad as you make out , how come you're not applying for jobs in ... pitlochry?
i know paul's gone completely mad .
i know , i know , i know .
it's just that it kind of rubs off on you somehow .
it makes a difference
to how you think about things .
like?
like today , right?
i want us to win .
with you so far .
i think we will .
home to norwich , you'd usually predict two nil defeat .
nil nil if you was on top of the world .
lf we don't , it's not the end of the world .
four games left . twelve points to be won .
that's not what i mean .
lf we don't win the league ,
i'll cope because of sarah and the baby .
when you've got nothing else going on ,
arsenal fill all the gaps .
you end up getting in a state about losing to spurs when really you should be getting in a state about yourself .
but we will win today .
sun's out , i'm gonna be a father ,
alan smith's back .
five nil , no trouble .
let's go .
'george graham off the bench
'to shake hands with a very disappointed dave stringer .
'norwich know their championship challenge
'has evaporated .
'arsenal's is very much
'on course after today .
'arsenal five , norwich city nil .
'alan smith the man of the match
'with two goals ,
'one of them a splendid effort ... '
everything's happening at once and it's brilliant .
stick with me .
no way we won't win the league .
it's all you , is it?
nothing to do with george , smithy , rocky or me buying sugar mice?
you never get feelings like that?
i felt brilliant the day we got knocked out of the league by walsall .
got a pay rise , got off with caroline walsh the night before .
fat lot of fucking notice this lot took .
some of us have it , some of us haven't .
you must've had a shitty life for 1 8 years .
i haven't had it all the time but i've got it this season in spades .
did you go?
yeah .
we were great , weren't we?
my mum wants a season ticket .
can i have a quick word?
we're just talking about the rout of norwich .
yes , saw it on tv .
very impressive .
it's good that alan smith's back .
yeah .
run along , robert .
i had a word with the governors .
they'll be happy to interview you for head of year .
thanks , ted .
ted ... l'm not planning to make a habit of this if that's what you're worried about .
it's something out of the ordinary for me .
just be prepared , ok?
school governors can be a funny lot .
'.. still middlesborough nil ,
'arsenal nil ... '
you're kidding .
no way .
can't afford anywhere else .
n5's not the only place in the world , you know .
sarah , you know that's not true .
you hardly hear anything , most games .
how often do they play?
once a month .
something like that .
right .
do they leave much mess?
no .
shall i leave you to look around?
thanks , yeah .
what does it matter how close to the ground you live as long as you can come to the games?
when i was a kid , i read this ... story about what used to happen round here on cup final days if arsenal were playing .
they'd have this procession .
the women and kids dressed up in fancy dress and led the men going to wembley to the station .
i lived in maidenhead .
what did we have there?
money , decent schools , holidays abroad , enough food .
yeah .
you're right , yeah .
i was lucky .
but i was rootless , too .
i didn't have anything like that .
nothing i could be proud of , nothing i can look back on and feel sentimental about except telly programmes and pop music .
but it's different here .
anyway ... it's close to the tube .
it's 50 minutes from the west end .
it's not far from school .
i'm not prepared to indulge your fantasies .
the best thing for you would be to get further away , not a few yards nearer .
it doesn't feel like that .
tough .
no .
no !
it's a lovely house .
really .
it's just the view .
'so george graham ... '
tell me again what was wrong with that place in ...
creighton avenue .
the one with the garden .
'despite all their control , arsenal ... '
i'm talking to myself .
somewhere a bit further north , anyway .
bounds green?
'john lukic prepares to play it downfield ... '
watford? '.. lnto the middlesborough half ... '
how about darlington?
there's a team there .
'goal ! '
yes !
yes !
yes !
yes !
helsinki .
helsinki united are really good this season .
one martin hayes !
there's only one martin hayes !
one martin ...
so , paul ...
confident?
sorry , not about the job .
about what's going on down the road .
arsenal .
my boy tells me you're a fan .
oh , right .
well , er ... so far , so good .
season ticket holder?
yes .
whereabouts?
er , north bank .
right , shall we , um ...?
who d'you think we should sign?
think we need a new striker?
er ...
i'm delighted we didn't get kerry dixon .
ray ...
ray , i think we should , um ...
oh , sorry , ted .
once you get going , it's hard to stop .
we know all about your teaching abilities .
what extra mural activites are you involved in?
paul's just coached the under 1 4s to the cup final .
my nigel thinks you should be england manager .
might be a more suitable position than head of year .
i did the school play last summer and ...
who've we got in the final?
parkside?
are they any good?
pretty good .
and i've been very much involved in the pastoral side of things as a form teacher .
and we understand that , um , you're an expectant father .
um ... yes .
that's one of the extra mural activities you forgot to mention , paul .
chatting up other members of staff .
more than chatting them up .
you've got good taste , i'll give you that .
'as we reach the final saturday
'of the league season ,
'we're not sure of the destiny of the league title .
'arsenal are favourites ... '
'both sides must keep winning .
'defeat for liverpool at wimbledon this afternoon
'and a win for arsenal against derby ... '
hello?
oh , hello , ted . '.. when they meet wimbledon . '
no , just watching saint and greavesie .
yeah , home to derby . '.. at anfield ... '
thank you . '.. on may the 26th . '
oh . .. oh , right .
i wasn't really expecting it , to be honest .
it didn't go brilliantly , did it?
oh , is she?
well , no ...
i think she'd make a very good head of year .
yeah .
look , thanks ...
thanks for letting me know .
no , i'd have swapped it for three points this afternoon anyway .
cheers , ted .
when was the last time you felt this nervous about a league game?
i dunno .
1 971 , i should think .
two home wins , could be champions tuesday night .
lmagine .
what we gonna do?
drink , i expect .
can't think about it in bed at night otherwise i can't sleep .
champions !
take back everything you said about me .
i will .
tuesday night .
this is the worst day of my life .
1 8 fucking years and they blow it on the last weekend of the season .
come on , paul , it's only half time .
it's only one nil .
doesn't matter .
they've blown it .
knew they would , didn't l?
useless bastards !
i am sorry .
yeah , thanks .
how are you feeling?
sick .
i just wasn't expecting it , not today , anyway .
they had to tell you some time .
tell me what?
what have we been talking about?
what have you been talking about?
the job !
the job? !
you think i'd be this upset about a stupid , poxy job interview?
we lost at home to derby today .
we've blown it !
when are you gonna wake up to yourself?
wake up to myself?
i am bloody awake !
i wish i wasn't .
i want to go to sleep for the next ten seasons .
seasons .
i am sick to death of hearing about bloody seasons !
we live our lives in years , paul .
january through to december .
not all of us .
yes , all of us .
even you .
do you understand what today meant?
you know how long i've been waiting for this?
yes , i do .
1 8 years .
yeah , 1 8 years !
i've wanted arsenal to win the league
longer than i've wanted anything .
i've been after that head of year job for about two weeks .
you think i'd care about that more?
no , you care more about one team scoring more than another .
you thought i came to comfort you about that?
for a moment , yeah .
i credited you with imagination .
thought you might understand .
it's only a game .
don't say that !
please !
that is the worst , most stupid thing anyone could say !
it quite clearly isn't only a game .
lf it was , d'you honestly think i'd care this much?
eh?
1 8 years !
1 8 ... years !
d'you know what you wanted 1 8 years ago?
or ten?
or five?
did you wanna be head of year at a north london comprehensive?
i doubt if you've wanted anything for that long .
and if you had , and if you'd spent three months thinking that finally you were gonna get it and just when you think it's there , it's taken away from you !
i don't care what it is a car , a job , an oscar .
the baby .
then you'd understand how i was feeling tonight .
but there isn't and you don't , so ...
so what?
so ... fuck off?
go home?
leave you alone?
whatever .
there isn't anything i've wanted for 1 8 years because i was a kid
lf i did still want the same things , i'd have gone wrong .
i don't want to marry david cassidy , have bigger tits , do well in my mock 'o's .
i've stopped worrying about all that .
maybe there's a big bit of you that's gone missing .
maybe everyone should want something they've always wanted .
i don't know what i've been thinking of .
how d'you mean?
we've both been pretending that this is possible and it's not , is it?
this wife and kids and la di da life's great stuff .
it's not on , any of it , is it?
all it took was one bad football result and we're now back to " life is shit so what's the point?
what ls the point?
i don't think that arsenal's home form is a sturdy enough basis for marriage and parenthood .
no .
not even thls season .
'.. give him a surprise enema . '
'sir nigel? '
hello?
'how are you? '
oh , hi , mum .
yeah , just having a night in .
yeah , i know .
they were awful .
yeah , yeah ...
she's fine .
she ... says hello .
look , mum , i've gotta go .
supper's on the table .
i'll call you tomorrow .
bye , mum .
mr ashworth , the play was supposed to start five minutes ago .
we're waiting .
no good , miss .
he's got the hump .
have you had a row?
shut up , holly .
ok , everyone into the hall .
quietly !
how did arsenal get on last night?
you have a look .
ooh ... sorry .
they drew two two .
what does that mean?
dunno .
apart from bad .
it means they have to beat liverpool away to win the championship .
now , i've heard of liverpool .
they're famous for being good , aren't they?
gary lineker , peter shilton , all that lot .
so arsenal have no chance?
none whatsoever , it says here .
but do we really care that much?
don't bounce it in here .
miss hughes .
are you chewing?
no .
and finally , i probably don't need to tell you that the final of the south hertfordshire
schools cup competition takes place here this afternoon at 4 . 30 .
i'm sure you join me in wishing mr ashworth and the boys the very best of luck .
not that they'll need it .
i know that many of you will be anxious to get home to start your homework .
but ... those who feel they can spare the time , and wish to lend their vocal encouragement , will be most welcome .
thank you .
i think you stand an extremely good chance ...
how are we doing?
losing one nil .
playing shit .
how long to go?
almost finished .
penalty !
come on , somebody !
it's all down to you , rob .
good boy , robert .
rob !
you're useless !
sorry , sir .
you don't need to say anything .
i wasn't gonna say anything .
i should never have taken it .
no one else had the guts .
yeah , so i'm stupid as well as useless .
doesn't matter .
you've had a brilliant season .
it's not what i'm gonna remember , though , is it?
anyway ...
winning this afternoon and arsenal winning tomorrow night ...
what would you go for?
tomorrow night , of course .
there you go , then .
what?
you're telling me
arsenal are gonna win two nil at anfield .
can't promise , can l?
there's a chance .
you've done your bit .
missed a penalty .
lf that's what it takes , it's worth it .
yeah , 'course .
# what can i say?
# she's walking away
# from what we've seen
# what can i do?
# still loving you
# it's all a dream
# how can we hang on to dreams?
# how can it really be
# the way it seems?
# what can i do?
# she's saying we're through
# with how it was
# what will i try?
# i still don't see why
# she says what she does
# how can we hang on to dreams?
# how can it really be
# the way it seems? #
good luck , sir .
you've got nothing to worry about .
no chance .
hope you get stuffed , sir .
hi .
oh , hi .
off to watch the big match?
yeah .
i just came to wish you good luck .
thanks .
the boys in my gcse set were trying to explain it to me .
you have to win two nil , right?
yeah .
it's possible , isn't it?
you've got no chance , sir .
shut up !
ls it right you've handed in your notice?
yeah .
i need more money .
child support .
we could've managed .
between us .
it'd be a bit awkward , working in the next room to the absent father of your child .
maybe .
well , i'll be thinking of you tonight .
are you gonna watch?
i'm not sure .
my fifth formers are having and end of school party and i've been invited .
but i'll try .
it doesn't matter .
it's only a stupid game .
'the teams occupying
'first and second place in the championship .
'the last match of the season
'for the league championship .
'the anfield roar welcoming and intimidating
'as we join our commentary team
'of david pleat and brian moore .
'thank you , elton .
'good evening , everybody .
'arsenal on the pitch ...
'with bouquets of flowers .
'which i think are ... '
we should be there .
you were the one who said it wasn't worth the hassle .
i didn't know it'd be the title decider .
anyway , imagine all those
scousers celebrating .
i'd rather be down here with my own people . .. person .
thank you .
oh , sorry .
# she's gone away ,
# i don't know where
# somewhere i can't follow her ... #
thought you were a football fan , duncan .
that's why i can't stand arsenal .
sounds like an old joke .
no joke .
william?
hate football .
and arsenal .
don't you wanna know how they're getting on?
no .
go on , i bet you do .
we wouldn't mind .
mind if miss hughes sticks the tv on?
she wants the football scores .
i don't , really .
not much .
i wonder why . lf you must , but just to find out the score .
ok .
still nil nil , first half .
'lnto that crowd it goes . '
there he is my mate , mickey thomas .
shut up , mum .
he's useless .
i like him .
shows what you know .
'they out played them
'for most of the littlewoods cup tie ... '
miracle of modern technology .
but it hasn't got an aerial or nothing .
it doesn't need one .
'positive charge by adams
'but it falls to whelan . '
oh , hello , love .
i was wondering who'd dare ring tonight .
'arsenal have some very big chaps ... '
your brother'll have the phone off the hook .
'it'd be dangerous to give away ... '
no score .
no , not really .
they don't look like they're gonna let one in either .
hold on . '.. tangling with whelan .
'michael thomas getting to the byline .
'danger for liverpool . '
oh !
no !
ah !
that was it .
that was our chance .
no , there'll be others .
you reckon?
i don't .
'arsenal within a whisker
'of getting the goal they wanted
'early in this game . '
let's go out . .. you're kidding .
no , let's go and get hammered .
forget all about it .
i'm watching till the end .
can't do that .
sorry .
'just imagine the tension
'if arsenal do manage to snatch a goal . '
sit down .
there's no point !
i'm off in a minute .
i'll just ... stay till half time .
'everyone's looking very closely at him .
'he's beginning to get the mood of this game ... '
i'll just see what they've got to say .
doin 'ok , aren't we?
what's the use of ok?
might as well be losing eight nil .
lf you want to win a game two nil , you've got more chance if it's nil nil at half time than if you're eight goals down .
you're living in cloud cuckoo land !
join the real world !
ln the real world , it's nil nil at half time !
might as well be eight nil .
jesus , paul , you need medical help .
you've got some kind of disease that turns people into miserable bastards .
are you stayin '?
no !
'i'm just wondering at what stage
'george graham will decide ... '
just watch a couple of minutes of the second half .
'winterburn and richardson behind it .
'adams made a darting little run in there .
'and smith ! '
y e e es !
yes !
ha , ha !
yeah !
yes !
yes !
yes !
'liverpool players
'are surrounding the referee . '
he's gonna disallow it now .
typical .
bet you any money you like .
'he's coming to have a word with the linesman .
'now a crucial decision here .
'ronnie whelan looking on there .
'the goal's been given . '
ye e es !
lsn't that just like arsenal?
they need two so they score one just to get us all going .
you want 'em to score a second before they scored the first?
'and what a game we have now .
'the breakthrough by arsenal ,
'their fans ...
'are delighted .
'back to smith .
'adams there with him .
'merson ...
'richardson ...
'a chance here ...
'thomas ! '
oh ! '.. grobbelar grabbed it . '
told you .
he's useless .
'suddenly , thomas , totally unmarked ... '
that's it .
i've had enough .
i'm off .
good .
fucking good riddance !
are you coming?
no !
it's m y flat !
you try gettin 'me out of it .
'and hansen will get it back .
'quarter of an hour left . '
they've scored !
ok , listen up , everyone .
i don't know what to say now .
sasha !
um , well , basically , miss hughes , we had a whip round and bought you a thank you present .
was that it?
brief and to the point .
thank you .
wait .
there's a bit more .
well , we didn't like you at first
'cause you gave us too much work .
but we really enjoyed it and we think we'll pass our exams so you must be a good teacher .
scott , who's at home watching football , says you're like george graham because you push us hard and get results .
dinner's ready , guys !

highbury , please .
whereabouts?
just around the corner from the arsenal ground .
i don't wanna go there tonight .
not now .
it's in liverpool , the football .
but i'm tapin 'it , see .
they'll give the game away there .
they'll be doin 'their nut or be as quiet as the grave .
you can go in and out before the final whistle .
come on , then .
# lookin 'for my baby
# been around the world
# and i'm gonna ... ##
you're an arsenal fan , then?
used to be , when i was a kid .
charlie george an 'all of them .
i don't go any more .
i'd bloody love 'em to win tonight .
i'd bloody love it !
'remember , arsenal need two goals .
'at the moment , they have one .
'lf it stays this way ,
'liverpool will be champions for the 1 9th time . '
we shouldn't even have turned the tv on this evening .
'but will it stay this way? '
what did we think would happen?
i don't reckon i'll be able to carry on after this .
i won't be able to ... pick myself up .
well , to get this close !
'unless there is an amazing and dramatic ... '
why did i listen to you?
me?
you said we had a chance !
well , we did .
we do !
we're practically in injury time !
'arsenal have powered forward
'in search of the second goal . '
i might start supporting a team that never wins .
orient or someone .
at least you know where you stand .
you don't lay yourself open to situations like this .
'.. his team mate , john aldridge ... '
can you believe that?
you're on your way out .
see what they want when you're down there .
'presumably , we'll have to go on .
'and remember ,
'arsenal have both substitutes already on . '
'one minute to go .
'mcmahon has got the word from the kop , obviously .
'but nobody knows quite how much time
'the referee will add on . '
this is awful !
it's like the end of the world !
'lf arsenal are to lose the championship ,
'having had such a lead at one time ,
'it's somewhat poetic justice
'that they have the result
'even though they're not to win it . '
oh , shut up , pleat .
'you can see we're now
'well into time added on . '
will you please , please , please , please please just fucking fuck off !
you have arrived during the worst 60 seconds of my life and i don't want to see you !
i ask you !
what sort of berk would do that?
you'd just about forgive an alien from planet tharg but even then , you'd ...
where you going?
you're mad !
you might miss something !
'adams is after his man .
'but barnes will not be denied .
'yes , he will , by richardson .
'down and injured .
'streaming forward now
'in what will be their last attack .
'good ball by dixon , finding smith .
'to thomas .
pa a a a a aul !
'charging through the midfield , thomas ! '
'it's up for grabs now ...
'thomas !
'right at the end . '
a a a a a a ah !
'an unbelievable climax
'to the league season ! '
a a a a a a ah !
mickey thomas !
yeah !
yes !
yes !
yes !
oh !
oh ...
how much injury time is there?
they've had two minutes already .
they'll go straight up the other end and score .
'that's the final whistle .
'arsenal , the champions . '
and ashworth has done it !
arsenal !
arsenal !
we are the champions !
yeah !
# from the dark end of the street
# to the bright side of the road
# we'll be lovers once again
# on the bright side of the road
yes !
# little darling , come with me
# you can help me share my load
# from the dark end of the street
# to the bright side of the road ... #
i knew we'd do it .
i had this feeling .
oh , yeah?
you're a lying bastard .
no , no , honestly .
on the surface ,
i was all negativity and doubt .
but on the inside , you gotta believe , haven't you?
# baby , some time
# i feel some time , i don't know why ...
# let's enjoy it while we can
# let's enjoy it while we can
# help me sing my song
# help me sing my song
# little darling , follow me
# to the bright side of the road
# from the dark end of the street
# from the dark end of the street
# to the bright side of the road
# to the bright side of the road ... #
i am sorry .
no .
no , thank you .
i wouldn't have missed this for the world !
paul !
friend of yours?
a guy i work with .
he's enjoying himself .
yeah .
i've never seen him so happy .
when i think back to the 26th of may , 1 989 now , it's impossible to explain exactly what happened to either of us .
all three of us if you count the team .
but i do know this my relationship with arsenal changed that night .
it was as if i'd jumped on to the shoulders of the team and they'd carried me into the light that had suddenly shone down on all of us .
and the lift they gave me enabled be to part company with them in some ways .
we still see each other all the time and i still love them and hate them .
but i have my own life now .
my successes and failures aren't necessarily linked up with theirs .
that's got to be a good thing , i suppose .
life's never gonna be this good again .
fuck off .
don't start on me .
no , you don't get ...
what's his name?
michael thomas .
you don't get michael thomas moments in real life .
you don't get many in football , either .
i'm not in such a state , am l?
i didn't need saving after all .
what?
let's not get carried away .
you're still a tragic human being .
do we look particularly tragic tonight?
didn't see many miss jean brodies
leaping around the streets .
all too busy writing out tomorrow's lesson plans .
where did you find the term " lesson plan "?
you've never planned a lesson .
i've got better things to do .
oh , is that right?
ls , er , is george graham really horrible?
why?
no reason .
has somebody else noticed the resemblance?
yeah .
my fifth formers .
hah !
he has the reputation of being mean and dour and unapproachable and ...
ok , ok .
thank you , paul .
i think i get the message .
and driven !
# i think i'm going back
# to the things i learned so well
# ln my youth
# i think i'm returning to ...
# those days when i was young enough
# to know the truth
# now there are no games
# to only pass the time
# no more electric trains
# no more trees to climb
# but thinking young and growing older
# ls no sin
# and i can play
# the game of life to win
# i can recall a time ...
# when i wasn't ashamed
# to reach out to a friend
# now i think i've got ...
# a lot more than just my toys to lend
# now there's more to do
# than watch my sail boats glide
# and every day can be ...
# a magic carpet ride
# a little bit of courage
# ls all we lack
# so catch me if you can ...
# i'm going back #
