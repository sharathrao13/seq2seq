you're here to take my place , send me back into the void , and rob me of all i have .
come along , ma'am
she'll be the first thing you steal from me she , the woman i love .
you already steal her love .
he's asleep .
let's go .
stop it .
mommy !
what swollen little feet !
tied up so tight ... don't cry , don't cry ...
who is it?
he was alone on mount cithaeron .
i found him there .
he was crying , so i brought him here
thinking you ...

son of fortune .

he squeals like a goat .
this son of fortune shall be king of corinth .
queen !
queen look !
the king !
the king !

without the slightest delicacy ... come , " little swollen feet " .
little oedipus , my son ...

oedipus kicked the disk ahead .
see the mark !
foundling !
son of fortune !
false son of your father and mother !
mother ... i had a bad dream , but i don't remember it .
i woke up crying , and trembling in the dark .
the gods meant to tell me something .
but what , if i can't remember it?
i lay awake till dawn came .
afraid of the silence and the darkness .
mother , father , i'd like to go to delphi to ask the oracle of apollo , about my dream , about what i can't remember .
of course , my son .
all make a pilgrimage at least once in their life .
to apollo's shrine , rich and poor to ask about their dreams , and you haven't gone yet .
it's beautiful there .
i went there with your father when i was young .
didn't i?
do you remember?
it's a real feast , better than ours .
very well .
if you want to go ... then go .
you'll have an incomparable escort .
no father .
i'll go alone .
our son is right .
the gods don't care for display , they want sincerity .
when will you leave?
tomorrow at dawn .
so soon?
at once?
why should i wait?
i don't want that dream to come and torment me again .
don't cry .
i'll be back in a few days .
goodbye son .
goodbye , " little swollen feet " .
goodbye father .
goodbye mother .
in your fate it's written you will kill your father and will make love with your mother .
you understand?
it's written in your fate .
you will kill your father and make love with your mother .
this says the god , and it'll surely come to pass .
now go away .
don't infect people with your presence .
corinth
where are you going , my youth?
where , my life?
thebes
away !
out of my way , beggar !
i warn you !
off the road !
watch out !
boy , what happened?
why are all these people leaving the city , and are camping here like a tribe of gipsies?
do you know?
of course i know .
i'm messenger , i bring the news , so i have to know .
and?
come with me .
that's tiresias , the prophet .
your brothers and fellows weep searching for salvation .
and you're here alone , blind and singing .
i wish i were you !
you sing what's beyond destiny .
our city's misfortune is up there .
it came up from a deep abyss to frighten us .
we were all doing fine before .
who could have imagined that?
nobody dares drive it back to the abyss , even thought the man who does will marry jocasta , the queen of thebes .
and so our city's lost .
everyone's leaving , as there's no point in staying .
where are you going?
don't go !
it's no use !
you'll die .
come back !
what are you doing?
come back !
there's an enigma in your life .
what is it?
i don't want to know it .
it's useless .
i don't want to see you .
i don't want to see you .
i don't want to hear you !
it's useless .
the abyss where you're thrusting me is inside you .
the sphinx is dead !
come !
come !
the sphinx is dead !
the sphinx is dead !
come to creon !
come to the queen !
you killed the sphynx and you'll become the queen's husband !
you'll be king !
come !
there she is .
my love .
these boys and i are here to beseech you , not because we look upon you as a god .
when you came here , didn't you rid us of the sphinx?
you didn't perform this act because you're wiser than we .
but with a god's help .
therefore oedipus , our king , we beg you on our knees , find a solution whether prompted by a god or a man .
you who are the best among us , give life back to us .
don't let your reign be remembered because you upraised us and then let us fall again .
i am aware of the wishes you bring , oh unfortunate citizens .
i know how you suffer .
but no one suffers more than i .
because your sorrow touches one alone of you while mine is the sorrow of all , mine and yours .
you haven't awaken me .
i was not sleeping , i was crying .
seeking ways to escape .
there is only one course .
i have taken it .
i have sent my brother in law creon to apollo's shrine .
to learn what to do .
and having counted the time since creon left , i am anxious .
what's he doing?
why is he so late?
why hasn't he returned yet?
creon is here .
god .
may he bring us a fate of salvation !
creon , my brother in law , my friend !
what is the answer?
good news !
even the most horrid things can end well .
we want the answer .
shall i tell it before all or inside the house?
before all .
i suffer for them .
to defeat the disease which plagues thebes ,
the man who spread it must leave the town " .
what is he charged with?
what can his sentence be?
death or exile .
a murder is the cause of what's happening here .
who might the victim be?
before you , the king was laius .
so i was told .
i never met him .
he is the victim .
the gods want his murderer to be punished .
how can we find him?
where can we find the traces of a crime which took place so long ago?
here , the god said .
here .
what we don't want to know does not exist ,
but what we want to know , " exists .
was laius killed in the palace?
in the country?
abroad?
he was going to apollo's shrine , and he never returned .
no guard or travelling companion witnessed the murder?
only one escaped .
and reported one thing .
what?
from one thing others can be deduced .
yes , there were rumours .
what?
that he wasn't killed by bandits but by a wayfarer .
who could prove it?
the only living witness .
frighten him , and he'll speak .
as you king i command that whoever knows who killed laius speak , even if he knows he'd accuse himself .
if those who know don't speak , i forbid the men of this nation which now is mine to welcome him and pray with him .
i shall avenge the slain king as if he were my father .
now that his power has passed to me , and his possessions and his wife are mine .
tiresias !
you're here !
i have sent for you , and from you i'll know all .
how terrible knowldge is , when to know is useless to him who knows .
i knew , but i preferred to forget .
otherwise i wouldn't have come here .
what frightens you?
let me go home .
i beg you , listen to me .
the burden will be lighter for us both .
to speak to the city is your duty .
your words are of no use even to yourself .
stay !
you know !
we all beseech you , my citizens and i .
you're mad .
i won't speak .
i won't reveal your illness .
you know and you keep silent !
you want to ruin our town?
you have a heart of stone !
you reproach me , you blame my nature , and don't want to judge your own nature .
your words are insulting , to the king and this town .
facts will speak .
even if i say nothing .
therefore speak !
i've said too much .
be as angry as you wish .
you plotted the crime !
were you not blind , you would have done it with your hands .
this is what you think?
obey your own judgement , and beware of remaining here among us .
you're the guilty one who infects our land .
you're the murderer you're seeking .
and you do not know of your wicked bond with the dearest persons you have .
and you refuse to see the evil in yourself .
you will not escape your words unharmed !
i'm already safe .
i have the truth on my side .
the truth for everyone but you , with blind eyes and mind !
unhappy man !
you insult me as everybody will insult you in a short time .
who's responsible for these lies , you or creon?
oh , richness , oh , power !
what envy you arouse in this life !
thanks to the power i received as a gift unasked for .
even the faithful creon , wants to overthrow me .
creon , yes , wants to take my place sending this charlatan , this beggar who can see only when he can earn something , and is blind artfully .
even if you are the king i can reply as frankly as you , if i wish to .
i am subject only to god .
you look , and do not see the shame and evil in which you are .
do you know who gave you life?
do you know that your kind , living and dead , curse you?
one day you will see only darkness .
how you'll cry out then , the day when you'll finally understand how , and with whom you were married .
son of fortune !
so you address me?
leave at once !
what are you waiting for?
out of my sight !
i don't wanna hear you !
i'm here because you called me .
i'd never have done it if i had thought i'd hear such nonsense .
this , you see , is our fate .
we are mad in your eyes .
we are wise for those who begot you ... what do you mean?
who begot me?
let us go .
lead me .
yes , go away and disappear with my torment .
i shall leave only when i've said all i have to say .
listen ...
listen .
the man you are seeking , with threats and orders , is here .
a foreigner as all believe , yet he is from thebes .
but he'll not rejoice in this discovery , because , having become a blind beggar , he'll wander through foreign lands
like me , wretched flute player .
it will be known that he is at once brother and father of his children , son and husband of his mother .
that he has slept with the woman who was his father's .
and that he , he alone is his father's murderer .
oedipus refuses to recognise his crime , and he puts the blame on me and his people .
oh look !
why have you come here?
how dare you turn up at my house?
you , who want to get rid of me and seize my kingdom?
you've come because you think i'm a coward and a madman?
i've got power and the people on my side .
you have nothing .
don't say you're innocent without evil intentions towards me .
you suggested that i questioned tiresias .
how long ago was laius killed without a trace?
a long time .
and tiresias?
did he utter no prophecies?
yes , winning the respect of everyone .
he didn't mention me , by chance ... in his prophecies?
in my presence , never .
then ... into the death of laius , your king you made no inquiries?
surely , but in vain .
in this case , why did tiresias not say anything?
i don't know .
really?
and you don't know that you two agree when he says i'm the murderer we are seeking?
tell me .
isn't your wife my sister?
your sister?
she is !
don't you share power with her?
of course i do .
and with me too .
what do i lack?
no .
i've no desire to be sovereign .
i'm content to live like a sovereign .
it is much wiser .
i have what i want without effort , or worries .
but if i were king , how many trials i'd have !
too much of anxiety and responsabilities !
no , madness and evil are one i am not mad , and i desire nothing else .
go to apollo's shrine and make sue of the oracle , see if i invented it in league tiresias .
if i did , condemn me rightly .
and your sentence will be death , not exile !
death !
in that case , go .
it's not for him , but for you that i'll do it .
this way i also condemn myself .
you give in , but with rancour .
why?
go !
go !
go !
what are you waiting for?
why?
why you and creon?
because your brother accuses me of laius's murder .
did he make this charge on his own or was he prompted?
no , he brought me tiresias .
tiresias accuses me .
he is innocent .
if it's this , be calm .
no man can be a prophet .
listen and tell me if i'm wrong .
to my husband , king laius , there came a prophecy .
it said that one day he would be murdered by a son that i gave to him .
but he was killed by a gang of bandits , at a crossroads .
i must tell you that laius had had the child taken , and his feet tied up , then he had him thrown off a mountain , therefore he died .
judge then if prophecies predict the future .
don't worry , believe me .
god reveals to us his intentions without ambiguity or intermediaries .
if you knew how much those words of yours scare me !
what do you fear?
laius was killed at a crossroads .
yes , so they said .
where is it?
on the road to apollo's shrine ...
how long ago?
the news of his murder reached us shortly before your arrival in thebes .
god what do you want to do with me !
i don't understand why you're so interested in these things .
ask me nothing .
what did laius look like?
how old?
tall , with a big long beard .
he resembled you .
then maybe i was cursing myself before .
does it frighten you so to be your mother's lover?
many men dream of that .
maybe they live in fear?
the truth must be sought .
and i fear tiresias sees into the truth .
but was he travelling alone , your husband laius , or with a great escort?
he was with five men , four soldiers and a servant , on a cart .
and who said that?
the servant who escaped .
is he here , this servant?
no .
when he returned and saw you in laius's place , he begged me to send him with his flock as far from thebes as possible .
i granted his wish .
that faithful servant deserved it .
why do you ask me of him?
ask me no questions , i said too much .
i fear i've said even this unwillingly .
my father is polybus , king of corinth !
my mother is mrope !
but a boy i offended once called me false son !
i couldn't be silent .
i questioned my parents .
they went mad at that boy .
and i knew they were telling the truth .
but the doubt remained , i couldn't dispel it .
then i went to the shrine of apollo , but the god not only did not answer my questions , he actually revealed other frightful things to me .
it was destined that i would make love with my mother and that i would beget monstrous children !
it was destined too that i should murder my father .
after such prophecies , with what heart could i return home , to my parents in corinth?
i will not , will not hear !
we must talk !
poor oedipus !
may you never know who you are !
then i went off from corinth , at random .
at a crossrodas , a man he was on a cart with four guards and a servant a quarrel sprang up and i killed the guards and the man who had insulted me , who insulted me with his arrogance , his wish to master me , his authority .
if there were some kinship between that man and laius ... then i ...
mother !
i'll go to pray .
i'll go to pray the gods .
can't see things rationally but believes whatever is said to him provided that it brings anguish .
i'll go to pray for us , because we're all terrified seeing this good helmsman of ours mad with terror .
i've come to your town to speak with oedipus .
i am his wife .
what do you want?
speak about what?
good news for your house .
what?
from whom?
from corinth .
i've news that will give you joy and perhaps also sorrow .
speak !
in corinth , the inhabitants mean to elect oedipus their king .
isn't his father , old polybus , king of corinth?
he was .
he died and was taken to his tomb .
is this the man?
yes .
it's your turn , old man .
look at me and answer .
were you laius's servant?
yes .
what were you?
shepherd .
where did you graze?
on cithaeron , or thereabouts .
have you ever met this man?
what do you mean?
this man , do you know him?
i'm trying to remember him .
but i don't seem to have seen him ever .
that's natural .
it's was long ago .
but together ... we spent three seasons , three seasons !
that may be true , but it was years and years ago .
i found a baby on the mountain , and you were there .
what?
why do you ask me?
oedipus , your king , is the baby of that day .
that's nonsense !
not his words , but yours are nonsense !
be careful what you do !
what , oh king , do you reproach me for?
for your silence !
for not speaking of the baby you're asked about !
i know nothing .
what would you want me to say?
you'll be forced to speak .
watch out !
i'm an old man .
take him !
tie him up !
put an end to this !
but what?
what do you want to know?
so , did you take this baby on the mountain or not?
i did .
i wish i died on that day .
and who gave him to you?
was he your son or not?
he wasn't mine , he was given me by ... others .
who?
in the name of god , don't ask me !
speak , or you're done for !
he was laius's .
his slave or his son?
this is a thing that cannot be said .
and i can't listen to it .
but i must .
it was his son .
but nobody better than jocasta , your wife , knows it .
did she give you the baby?
yes .
with what orders?
to kill him .
why this atrocity?
because she feared bad prophecies .
which ones?
that he would kill his parents .
why did you allow him to be saved?
out of pity .
all is clear and wanted , not imposed by destiny .
thus i will no longer see the evil i have suffered and done .
in the dark i will not see what should not be seen .
i will not recognise those i wanted to recognise .
i should have severed also my ears to seal up in myself in my unhappy body .
to see and hear nothing ever again .
it's sweet to have the mind outside evil .
quick , send me away .
send far away this terrible man .
impure things must be kept silent .
silent !
hide me , take me outside this land of ours !
take me to some place where i cannot be seen more .
where are we?
in a place with many trees in a row and many little streams and a green , green field .
may the light that i couldn't see anymore , and which once was mine , instead , illuminate me for the last time .
i have arrived .
life ends where it begins .
