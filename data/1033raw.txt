you said three casinos?
these feed into the mirage and mgm grand , but every dime ends up there .
the bellagio and the mirage .
these are terry benedict's places .
yes , they are .
think he'll mind?
more than somewhat .
you'd need at ieast 1 2 guys doing a combination of cons .
like what , you think?
off the top of my head , i'd say you're iooking at a boesky , a jim brown ... ... a miss dalsy and a leon spinks .
not to mention the biggest ella fitzgerald eyer .
where will you get the money to back this?
hit these three casinos , we'll get our bankroll .

why do this?
why not do it?
i just left the joint after iosing four years of my life ... ... and you're cold decking teen beat cover boys .
because the house always wins . play iong enough , the house takes you .
unless , when that perfect hand comes , you bet big .
then you take the house .
you practiced that speech?
did i rush it?
it was good .
the teen beat thing was harsh .
i wonder what reuben will say .
you're out of your damn minds !
you're both of you nuts !
i know more about casino security than any man .
i inyented it .
and it cannot be beaten .
they got cameras and watchers , they got iocks .

okay , bad example .
it's neyer been tried .

a few guys eyen came close .
you know the three most successfui robberies in yegas?
number three , the bronze medal .

ofcourse , he was breathing out ofa hose for the next three weeks .
goddamn hippie .
and the closest any man has eyer come ... ... to robbing a las yegas casino ... ... was outside of caesars in '87 .
he came ... ... he grabbed ... ... they conquered .
but what am i saying?
you guys are pros .

i'm sure you can make it out of the casino .
of course , iest we forget ... ... once you're out , you're still in the middle of the fucking desert !

what do you have against him , is the question .
he torpedoed my casino .
muscled me out .
now he's gonna blow it up next month to make way for some monstrosity .
i see what you're doing .
what are we doing?
if you're gonna steal from terry benedict , you better goddamn know .
this used to be ciyilized .
you'd hit a guy , he'd whack you .
but benedict ....
at the end of it , he'd better not know you're inyolyed .
because he'll kill you , then he'll go to work on you .

get in the goddamn house .
the 3000 block of las yegas bouleyard ... ... also known as the bellagio , mirage and mgm grand .
they're three of the most profitable casinos in las yegas .
this is the bellagio yault , iocated ... ... beneath 200 feet of solld earth .
it safeguards every dime that passes through each of the three casinos .
we're gonna rob it .
smash and grab job?
silghtly more compilcated than that .
well , yeah .
this is courtesy of frank catton , a new dealer at the bellagio .
bad news first .
this place houses a security system riyallng most nuclear silos .
first , we have to get in the casino cages , which takes more than a smile .
next , through these doors ... ... each one requiring a different code changed every 1 2 hours .
past those , the eleyator .
here's where it gets tricky .
it won't move without fingerprint i. d. which we can't fake .
and yocal confirmation from the system within the bellagio and the yault .
which we won't get .
the eleyator shaft is rigged with sensors .
if we override the llft , the exit would iock and we'd be trapped .
once we get down the shaft , it's a piece of cake .
just two more guards with uzis ... ... and the most elaborate yault door eyer conceiyed .
any questions?
tunnellng's out .
there are ... ... sensors monitoring the ground .
if a groundhog nested , they'd know .
anyone else?
you mentioned good news?
yeah .
the neyada gaming commission requires ... ... a casino to keep enough cash to cover every chip in play on the floor .
that means on a weekday it must carry ... ... between $60 and $70 million in cash and coin .
on the weekend , between 80 and 90 million .
on a fight night ... ... like in two weeks , the night we're robbing it ... ... $1 50 million , without breaking a sweat .
there are 11 of us , each with an equal share .
you do the math .
exactly .
i have a question .
say we get into the cage and through the security doors ... ... down the eleyator we can't move ... ... past the guards with the guns , into the yault we can't open
and not seen by cameras .
sorry , i forgot to mention that .
yeah , well , say we do all that ... ... we're just supposed to walk out of there with $1 50 million ... ... without getting stopped?
yeah .
oh .
okay .
first task : reconnalssance .
i want to know what goes on ... ... in all casinos , from the dealers 'rotation ... ... to the path ofcash carts .
i want to know everything about every guard .
this girl charmalne ...

ideally , we all should wear gloves to bed ... ... but i found there was interference with my social agenda , you know .
plus , i react to the camphor .
so i'm not into the traditional remedies .
let me tell you something .
if you could pay cash ... ... i could drop that down to seyen

he works hard , hits the lobby floor at 7 on the nose .
good eyening , sir .
how are you?
talks with his casino manager .
about what?
all business .
benedict likes to know what's going on .
be in control .
there's rarely an incident he doesn't know about or handle personally .
spends a few minutes glad handing the high rollers .
he speaks spanish , german and italian and is getting good at japanese .
he 's out by 7 : 30 and is handed a black portfollo .
contents : profits and new security codes .
he heads to the restaurant .
like i said , a machine .
that portfollo contalns codes to all the cage doors?
and two minutes after they're changed , he's got them .
you guys really can pick them .
this guy's as smart as he is ruthless .
last guy he caught cheating , he not only sent up for 10 years ... ... he seized his house and bankrupted his
in iaw's dealership .
he takes out your knees and ruins your life and anybody you know .

the problem is , now we're stealing two things .

i'm not joking .
i'm not iaughing .
there's a confilct of interest when you ...
... giye me adyice about my love life .
but that doesn't mean i'm wrong .
do you remember what i said when we first met?
that i better know what i'm doing .
do you?
now?
you should go if you don't .
i know what i'm doing .
what are you doing?
just catching up .
meet my ex husband .
danny ocean .
mr. ocean .
i'm in your seat .
forgiye my iateness .
a guest required my attention .
that's fine .
danny was walking through and spotted me .
is that so?
imagine the odds .
of all the gin joints in all the world .
you recently were released from prison?
that's right .
how does it feei to be out?
about the same .
danny was just about to  i just stopped by to say hi to tess .
stay , have a drink .
i can't .
he can't .
well , then ....
i imagine we won't see mr. ocean anytime soon .
you neyer know .
i know everything happening in my hotels .
so i should put those towels back .
no , the towels you can keep .
good to see you , tess .
take care , danny .
terry .
danny .
stinking ....
tomorrow the day is yours .
call is at 5 : 30 , makeup and costume .
saul's package arriyes at 7 : 05 .
linus grabs our codes .
all goes well , we're a go .
at 7 : 30 , yen is iocked in and we're committed .
from this point , we have 30 minutes to blow the power or he suffocates .
once the electricity goes , access to the yault ... ... and its eleyator shut down for two minutes .
that's when we go .
you're in the middle of the room , 10 feet from everything .
you have to get to the door without touching the floor .
what do you do?
ten says he shorts it .
twenty .
window or alsle , boys?
yeah , we're in deep shit .
that poxy demo crew didn't back the maln llne .
they naused up the malnframe .
naused it up !
you understand him?
i'll explaln iater .
they're so pony they blew the backup grids one by one .
basher , what happened?
they did what i would have done but by accident .
now they know their weakness , they're filxing it .
so unless we intend to do this job in reno , we're in barney .
barney rubble .
trouble !
we could always  by tomorrow?
hang on a minute , hang on .
we could use a pinch .
what's a pinch?
a deyice which creates a cardiac arrest for broadband circuitry .
better yet , a pinch is a bomb without the bomb .
when a nuclear weapon detonates , its electromagnetic pulse ... ... shuts down any power source within its blast radlus .
it usually doesn't matter because a nuclear weapon destroys everything .
a pinch creates a similar electromagnetic pulse ... ... without mass destruction and death .
instead of hiroshima you get ...
... the 1 7th century .
how iong?
30 seconds . could a pinch knock out the power of an entire city?
like , for instance  las yegas?
yeah , i think it might .
there's only one pinch big enough to do it .
where?
let's go .
