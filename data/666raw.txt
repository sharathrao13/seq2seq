good night
what do you want
maybe our appearance doesn't show it , but we are doctors from buenos aires and crdoba , respectively
we are traveling all over the country , doing some research with hopes of curing some of the worst diseases of the 20th century
plagues that not only consume our energy but that also keeps argentina in need
when by just reading the medical literature , you could notice , just as us ...
what the fuck do you want , pair of bums?
look sir , the wind took our tent , we are starving and we need a place to spend the night
ok , out there in the shed there's a good ground .
you can sleep with the workers
we are doctors ...
hmm ... i like your face a lot , but i don't like yours fatty
fine?
yes , its fine thank you .
dear mom ... we are still hitting the road , but to tell you the truth , the bike is less powerful every day
san martn de los andes , argentina january 31st , 1952 km 2051
money and food are scarce , but we manage to find opportunities to eat and sleep for free
alberto's infallible sweet talking ... plagues that not only consume our energy but compromise the modernization of argentina
so , you are doctors well , no .
alberto is a biochemist and i am an md student he is practically graduated , we are like doctors
then i would appreciate it if you could look at a swelling i have in the neck gladly , eh ... mr.?
von puttkamer
does it hurt?
this is a tumor what do you mean a tumor?
yes
do you think so yes allow me
i don't know fuser , fat sedimentation it could be a cyst
no .
it is a tumor in the occipital area
schatzie , these gentlemen say i have a tumor tumor?
good morning mam , i sincerely don't believe it is a tumor but a sebaceous cyst
if you could give us a place where we could eat and sleep we might be able to treat it
no , no look ... we can't treat it .
you will have to go to buenos aires .
i can recommend you a specialist
or we could try to help him , don't you think?
help with what?
with the grass , with prayers?
i understand , you can't do anything for me yes we can , if you give us a place where we could eat and sleep .
around here there's a lake with lots of fish and a shed sir , the diagnostic is very ...
we have nothing more to talk about , doctors .
let's go schatzie
the next time could you try to help us a little of course i can give you a hand , but never at the price of the health of a man
ok , let's say that you are right and the old guy has a tumor , how the fuck do you tell him like that?
is the truth , if he can't handle it he can go to hell
you can't treat a patient like that , you can't the guy has a serious problem , the sooner he looks into it the better
that's the proper treatment , didn't they teach you that at biochemistry school?
don't talk to me about proper medicine
nurse .
first graduate and then talk .
you think you know everything , moron
i'm going to look for food
duck ! duck ! duck ! .

that shot came out of your ass , besides i have asthma ok , you are right .
if you can't i il do it
i didn't say i couldn't you can't or you don't want to i didn't say that i couldn't

melancholy for what was left behind and on the other hand all the enthusiasm at entering new lands

what?
i think they deserve and explanation is adequate , yes
thanks lucho ... well , there is a long costume in argentina that doesn't allow us to drink with empty stomachs
and since we don't have any money at the moment , we can't buy food and we must reject your generous offer
please , don't be like that ... wait .
lucho , could you bring us some empanadas

has she eaten?
i don't know
look , doa rosa , i m going to leave you these pills

and one before bedtime .
this will help you feel better
dear mom ... i knew i wouldn't be able to help that poor woman
that up to a month ago she had been serving tables , panting like me
trying to live with dignity
in those dying eyes , there was a humble request for excuses
and a desperate plea of consolation that gets lost in the emptiness
just as her body will get lost very soon in the magnitude of the mystery that surrounds us
fuser , you still haven't asked me how was the field test with the chilean sisters
you know how i fear that you might become the new sexual ambassador of argentina
are you the two lazy asses that travel on that piece of crap
her name is " la poderosa
it was .
but now we could name it the dead one , the paraplegic
oh yeah , why?
what do you mean why?
because i m the mechanic , what else
if you sell it per pound , you might obtain something , but that piece of crap arrived dead here , really
i'll be missing you negra

good evening , how are you?
what's your name?
ernesto nice to meet you
yes , that's it , that's were we are from
we didn't have much , just a dry and difficult land
it belonged to his grandparents
it was ours , until a landlord arrived and kicked us out
and that is what they call progress we had to leave our son with the family and travel to find job
trying to escape from the police that wanted to catch us why?
because we are communists
we are going to the mine .
if we are lucky i il find a job .
apparently they are so dangerous that they don't care what party you belong to
are you looking for a job?
no , we are not .
no?
and then why are you traveling?
just because
bless you , blessed be your travels
take this
thanks
some " mate " thanks
those eyes had a dark and tragic expression
they told us about some friends that had disappeared under mysterious circumstances
and that apparently ended up in some part on the bottom of the ocean
that was one of the coldest nights of my life
but meeting them made me feel closer to human kind .
strange , so strange to me
you ... you too you , the next one
move it , guys , move it
chuquicamata mine , chile march 15th , 1952 km 5122
move it , guys , move it
get in the truck .
the rest go to your homes .
out
you two , what are doing here?
nothing , we are looking
looking at what , this is not a tourist attraction .
out
can't you see that these people are thirsty .
give them some water damn it .
i will call security so they will arrest you
oh yeah .
why?
invasion of property .
this is the property of the anaconda mining company
let's go .
son of a bitch
when we left the mine , we felt reality was changing ... or were we the ones changing
going deeper and deeper into the mountain range we found more natives that don't even have a roof in what used to be their own land
finally we entered peru
thanks to a truck driver half blind , felix
i almost forgot ... today is alberto's 30th birthday but not in venezuela , as he had envisioned
we were so tired , mom that we couldn't even celebrate
fuser
this is humanly impossible
finally we arrived to the heart of america ...
cuzco
cuzco , peru april 2 , 1952 km 6932
after entering the city , we met don nestor
a very wise man , mom that ended up as our official guide
i was wondering sir , which one of this walls is inca?
this one should be the inca wall , and that one is spanish
we , as a joke , call this one the inca wall and that one the wall of the incapables , those were the spanish
cuzco was the capital of the incas , but when the spanish came they destroyed everything , and named lima as the new capital
lima?
yes
this is the plaza?
yes
she says that she has never been to a school because she has always been near the cattle , that's why she doesn't know how to speak castilian only quechua
i think that before , there was enough money for everything , but now there's little money and there are no jobs
that is affecting us more and more
since i was little i have worked with crafts and that's how i keep on level ... regular
with both hands , with both hands
with both hands , nestor
good evening
good evening
when i was working , the owner came and he threw me out of the land
once i was producing all the products he threw me out
he threw you out?
how?
did he call the police?
yes , he brought the police .
he is a powerful man , he has a lot of money
he wanted me to leave the land yes , once it was producing
yes , it was producing wheat , corn , potatoes , beans ... and i was meant to keep a part of it
but i won't stay behind , i have to keep moving forward .
working , looking for money to educate my children
how many kids do you have?
i have five kids
have you joined with other farmers of the area?
yes , in the community we are organized , we help each other
we help each other , together
machu picchu , peru april 5th , 1952 km 7014
let's see how you behave fuser , eh?
that's it , that's it
for posterity
the incas had a high knowledge of astronomy , medicine , math , among others
but the spanish invaders had powder
how would america be today if things had been different?
fuser , look what i think .
i should marry with an inca descendant and found an indigenous party
we encourage everyone to vote
reactivate tupac amaru's revolution , the indoamerican revolution , fuser what do you think?
a revolution without gunshots?
you are crazy mial

the best part of lima , mom , was dr. hugo pesce
the chief of the program for the treatment of leprosy in peru
alberto had contacted him before starting the journey
he fed us , gave us cloth , money and some very good ideas
mariategui talks about the revolutionary potential of the natives and farmers of latin america
he says that the native main problem is the land and that the revolution will not be a copy but a heroic creation of our people
7 essays of interpretatlon of the peruvlan reallty

how are you guys?

nice to meet you .
bresciani nice to meet you
dr. pesce has talked very enthusiastically about you so , welcome to san pablo
by the way , i have a letter from dr. pesce for you do you want it now?
no , no , there'll be time for that
well , since we are here i can show you something
the amazon divides the colony in two
the south part is where we keep the patients .
here , in the north part is were the staff , the doctors and nurses live .
and a couple of nuns that are very efficient
this is your room
the beds are a little hard , but that is good for your spine
you can see the hospital from here
over there and that's the laboratory
doctor , let me introduce you to our argentinean volunteers
alberto , i understand you have some experience in baciloscopy
that's right i believe he could help us in the lab , why don't you take him with you
ernesto , you are going to help me in the hospital
here we have the more serious cases , we transfer them from the south area
georgina hello doctor
and do you make the operations on this side too?
yes , on that side we have an operating room
she is silvia , daughter of one of our patients and a very good nurse
how is he?
he's better , doctor
then keep administering the same treatment yes
doctor , then how many patients live in the south area?
almost six hundred
all of them peruvian?
no , most of them yes , but there are some from colombia , venezuela and other countries of south america
i suggest you use these gloves .
it's true that leprosy under treatment is not contagious but the nuns are very strict about this
if it's not contagious , then this is purely symbolic yes , but i m telling you so you don't make mortal enemies over there
well , you'll have to forgive us but we are not going to use them yes , thanks doctor
don't say i didn't warn you
take out the boxes .
come this way
good evening good evening
good evening .
welcome to san pablo thanks you are very kind
papa carlito , at your service nemesio reyna
ernesto guevara i'm alberto granado , a pleasure to meet you
nice to meet you
doctor , didn't you explain the rules to them?
nice to meet you
don nemesio , nice to meet you
papa carlito is the head of the community .
they are argentineans doctors
nice meeting you , bye
they are real gentlemen
dr. bresciani , this gentlemen arrive and think they can behave as they want?
mother san alberto , this gentlemen have good medical experience in cordoba and buenos aires
that doesn't give them the right to behave like this and break the rules
i suggest we leave this conversation for later , ok?
thanks mother , you are very understanding
she is the mother superior
this is the dinning hall .
the nuns make lunch on sundays , but only for those that come to mass
the sad thing is that most of san pablo's patients are here because they have been abandoned by their families or thrown out of their jobs
that's why they try to adapt to their new life building their own houses , seeding , caring for animals
doctor , good morning how is silvia?
she doesn't want to go to surgery thanks doctor , i il go see her
silvia is a patient a little rebellious and if we don't operate her ulna , she risks loosing her arm
hello silvia
she's very young
can i come inside to talk to her
yes
can i sit?
does your arm hurt?
what is wrong with you?
i was born with bad lungs
what a shame
no , is not that bad .
thanks to that i skipped the military service
i didn't have to shine anyone boots
is that why you became a doctor?
because you are sick?
is possible .
the first word i learned was injection
i want to be useful in some way
you are wasting your time why?
this life is hell
yes , it's really fucked up , but we have to fight for every breath and tell death to fuck off
hey fuser , bresciani is going to write me a recommendation for an internship in cabo blanco's hospital , in caracas what do you think?
that's nice .

yes
it keeps away the sick from the healthy
yes
that's it ...
just a quick ...

scalpel
it's ok , it's ok .

sister , why you don't give us food?
the rules of mother san alberto are very clear , we only serve to those who go to holy mass
what is it?
they won't give us food because we didn't go to mass
says who?
san alberto
mother yes?
we want to eat we deserve to eat like everyone else
yes but you didn't go to mass no
then , how do you expect to feed the body if you didn't feed the soul first
denying food is not very christian like yes , i doubt jesus would act like this
in this house we have a set of rules that have to be followed
i haven't read any rule book neither did i .
i think that if find it i would eat it
your lunch

and you?
are you going back to finish school?
i don't know .
if i find a way to get back to buenos aires , yes
you're going to be 24 next week , fuser
i should be thinking on something , right?
san pablo , peru june 14th , 1952
the mother dances well , uh?
i like the way she dances
no , i don't dance
thank you
it's good uh?
it's really good
listen , this is the tango that chichina's uncle played in miramar
ah yes , i like it you see yes , yes
do you know how to dance it?
this one's a little faster ,
but you know how to dance it .
and there's a lady very interested in dancing with you
should i ask her?
the bird in the stories flies and never returns
fly , fly
do you want to dance?
do you know how to dance?
yes
is just that this version is faster
dance ernesto !
did you think it was a tango?
mambo , mambo , mambo
happy birthday to you !
happy birthday to you !
happy birthday , ernesto , happy birthday to you !
make three wishes fuser
friends , one moment please ...
i believe this is a great opportunity to let ernesto and alberto know , how grateful we are
not just for having gotten here , but also for their commitment and enthusiasm to the patients of san pablo during the three weeks you have spent here
for that reason , we have prepared a little surprise
tomorrow you will receive a raft to continue your journey and we will name it , suggested by this night , the " mambo tango
thanks a lot
speech !
speech !
well ... i feel obligated to thank this toast with something more than a conventional gesture
but given the poor conditions in which we travel ... the only affectionate resource that we have is the word
and is by using it , that i want to thank you all , all the staff of the colony
thanks
you , that give us this magnificent display of affection by celebrating my birthday as you would celebrate one of yourselves
and since we will leave peru tomorrow , this words also serve as a goodbye in which i want to put all my effort to give a recognition to the people of this country that uninterruptedly have overwhelmed us with nice gestures since we arrived
and i would like to highlight something more , a little off topic of this toast
but don't worry , i won't dance
although our meager personalities prevent us from being spokesmen of your cause
we believe , even more after this journey , that the separation of america in false and uncertain nationalities is completely fictitious
we are a single mixed race , from mexico to the strait of magellan
so , trying to free myself from any nationality load
i raise a toast for peru and for america united
cheers
what's up with you?
do you know where the boat is?
no , i don't see it
i'm going to celebrate my birthday on the other side
yes , of course , tomorrow when we find the boat you will celebrate your birthday on the other side
no , now no you won't
my birthday is today not tomorrow i know fuser but ... are you crazy
you can't cross the river at night with all those animals that can eat you raw
mial , how many times in this journey did we thought it was the end and look , here we are

i told you only to motivate you

son of a bitch
see you !
see you friend !
this is not the tale of impressive deeds
is a piece of two lives taken in a moment when they were cruising together along a given path
with identity of aspirations and a conjunction of dreams
was our vision too narrow , too partial , too rushed?
were our conclusions too rigid?
maybe ... ... but that aimless roaming through our enormous america has changed me more than i thought
i .. ... am not myself anymore
at least , i m not the same inside
eight years passed before the two of them would meet again
in 1960 , granado accepted an invitation to move to cuba to work as a researcher .
the invitation came from his old friend fuser , that at the time was known as commander che guevara , one of the few influential and charismatic leaders of the cuban revolution .
ernesto che guevara fought for his ideals in congo and bolivia , where he was captured by the regulation army and , with the consent of the cla , was assassinated in october of 1967
alberto granado , always faithful to his friend fuser , remained in cuba , where he founded the " school of medicine of santiago " .
today he lives in havana with his wife delia , his three sons and grandsons .
