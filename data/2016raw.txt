oh ; thank you ; arnold .
l i can manage that .
but i still don't see why you couldn't wait a couple of weeks .
why go all the way up to loki?
well ; we want to hear grace makanga speak ; and she won't be coming to nairobi .
i see .
oh , sweetheart , don't bother to see us off .
it could be ages .
okay , well [ kissing ]
it's too hot to be standing around .
if you're sure .
bye .
bye , arnold .
let me take your bag for you .
thank you .
bye , sweetheart .
see you in , uh in a couple of days .
sandy , he's here .
hi .
come in .
oh , hi , sandy .
you caught me skiving , i'm afraid .
how's gloria?
well?
gloria's fine .
you haven't heard from tessa , i suppose?
no , she's , uh , up north with , um , arnold bluhm .
look , old chap , do you think you could stop doing that a moment?
something wrong?
she didn't say anything about returning by road?
from loki?
well , that wouldn't surprise me , knowing tessa .
i mean , i hope not .
dangerous country .
what is it , sandy?
we're getting reports of a white woman , black driver , found early this morning ; southern end of lake turkana ; dead killed ; it seems .
you think it might be tessa?
seems they hired a car and driver in loki and then headed east .
they spent the night at lodwar .
they shared a room ; justin .
the dead black isn't arnold bluhm .
most terribly sorry .
and how sure are you?
it's not looking good .
it's ... good of you to tell me , sandy .
can't have been easy .
diplomacy ; therefore ; as we've demonstrated ; is the very map and marker of civilization , pointing nations the safest way through country ... fraught with peril .
and that's it .
uh ; sir bernard pellegrin has asked me to convey his ; uh ; regrets ... that he's been unable to deliver his lecture in person .
and i thank you on my own behalf for your very kind attention .
thank you .
excuse me .
excuse me .
yeah?
yeah , sorry .
excu excuse me .
sir , i've just got one question .
i just wondered whose map , um , is britain using ... when it completely ignores the united nations and decides to invade iraq?
or do you do you think ... it's more diplomatic to bend to the will of a superpower ... and and politely take part in vietnam ; the sequel?
well , uh , l i can't speak for sir bernard
oh , i thought that's why you were here .
i mean , diplomats have to go where they're sent .
so do labradors .
ooh .
ouch .
well ; i think that ; no ; sir bernard would no doubt argue ... that when , um , peaceful means are exhausted , then exhausted?
mr. quayle ; they're not exactly exhausted ; are they?
i mean , they're just they're just no , they are just lying in the way of the tanks .
no ; l l let's face it .
we've taken 60 years ... to build up this international organization called the united nations , which is meant to avoid wars ,
and now we just blow it up because our car's running out of petrol .
sit down , tessa , for christ's sake .
l i think  hold on a minute .
let's see what he says .
i think the questioner is making a valid point , and that a nation's foreign policy ...
should not be determined by narrow commercial interests .
that's bullshit .
that's bullshit .
you have to take responsibility .
you are being paid to apologize for this pathetic country of britain , and he can explain to us why we've burned our diplomatic credentials ... and why we're killing , you know , thousands of innocent people ... just for just for some barrels of oil ... and a photo opportunity on the white house lawn .
why?
are you all right?
yes , thanks .
you were courageous .
no .
no ; i was completely rude .
it was just bad behavior , and l  you were impassioned .
i'm so embarrassed .
sorry .
please don't be embarrassed .
i'm really sorry .
and , uh , thanks very much .
you ... tried to protect me .
very feebly .
no , you were you were you weren't feeble .
i just
anyway , it was a very dull lecture .
it was a dull lecture , but even so i shouldn't have
well , look , can l can i buy you a coffee or
i owe you a drink .
come on .
all right .
you can buy me a drink .
i'm justin , by the way .
tessa .
how do you do?
pleased to meet you .
yeah , yeah .
pleased to meet you .
you were quite scary , but i don't blame you .
it was absolute bollocks , so you're quite right to challenge
i'm rather nervous , i have to confess .
me too .
this way .
oh , do come in .
yeah , please .
of course .
thank you .
you lead the way .
go ahead .
go ahead .
take a left .
all right .

there we go .
thank you .

how very generous of me .

yes , i do .
it's , uh
it's my wife , tessa .
sandy .
come on .
tessa .
my god , what a surprise .
how'd you get in?
take me to africa with you .
what?
roll you up in a rug?
pack you in a tea chest?
very funny .
i'd have to smuggle you in as illicit goods .
i couldn't declare you .
oh , listen .
i could put you in one of these plant boxes , and
you'd be very comfortable wrapped up in a little piece of , uh
i could label you .
tessa .
i'm serious .
um , yeah , i can see you are .
and in what what capacity should i take you to africa?
i don't mind .
you can take me as your mistress , lover , wife .
there's too much choice .
l well , i'm
i'm flattered that you would like no .
no .
justin , please don't say that sentence .
sorry .
sorry .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
that's really
just yes or no?
well , we we hardly know one another .
i mean
you can learn me .
learn you?
mmm .
yes or no?
then l
oh .
a gift .
oh , thank you .
thank you .
thank you so much .
it's beautiful .
hey .

nevirapine .
the government clinic didn't have any again .
jomo .

jomo .
if she's h. i. v. positive , chances are you are too .

woodrow is very particular about time .
i will be in trouble .
bye .
i'll see you later .
jesus !
you shouldn't be wandering around in this heat .
arnold , stop fussing .
you're as bad as justin .
if you were my wife , i'd tie you to the bed .
then what would you do , doctor?
that's another story .
tell me what you'd do .
hey !
all right .
now ; for the first time ; we are exploring a new territory .
this is a new discovery ... for the famous marine biologist [ laughing ]
jacques cousteau .
you are a voyeur .
it's fantastic .
now we are going down , down , down .
oh , what do we have here?
zoom . !
wipe it .
i must keep this new discovery for posterity ... and admire the new person inside .
you have to go wipe this .
go and wipe it .
wipe it right now .
no , i can't wipe it .
i'm completely inept with computers .
i'm gonna keep it .
i'm sorry .
i love it .
will you see who that's from , darling?
sure .
what is it?
what?
the e mail .
oh , it's , um
it's just junk some ad .

for the nairobi hilton .
oh , my boobs hurt .

weekend package deal .
two nights for the price of one .
mmm .
two guests for the price of one .
sweetheart , would you come and make yourself useful?
yeah , i'm coming .
my darling .
sweetheart ; i'd like you to put this up right in the middle .
right?
yeah .
so , um
right there .
mm hmm .
what do you think?
i think it's gorgeous .
i think it's very tangled .
no ; no ; no .
i meant i meant about a weekend at the hilton .
oh , no .
it's a bit flashy for my taste .
is it?
mm hmm .
oh .
i wouldn't know .
l i've never been there .
well , i have .
i was there the other night meeting someone with arnold .
oh , well , just a thought .
sweetheart .
were you just inviting me away for a dirty weekend at the hilton?
mm hmm .
were you?
i would love to , but maybe after ...
arturo is born .
oh , tessa .
we're not calling him arturo , please .
why not?
no .
not not arturo ... or giuseppe all right .
then what about ...
garth daddy's name?
no , no .
come on .
no , not garth or ditto che or any
che?
i just don't want any of these mad , eccentric , hippieish
che?
alternative yes , your revolutionary half .
i think we should call him , in that case , che muffin quayle .
muffin?
yes , the quayle genes .
where do you get muffin from?
no one's heard of muffins .
high tea by the jolly study fire ... while the starving mob burns london .
is that is that how you see me?
no .
i see you buying the mob fish and chips ... while you wait for law and order to return .
and i love you the way you are .
what about arnold?
what about arnold?
as a name .
hmm .
be such a nice gesture .
well , perhaps it'll be a girl .
mmm .
i think it's a boy .
i think it's a girl .
you'd better get dressed .
move that tray .
dry these glasses .
can you open your windows , please?
please get out of the car .
dr. joshua ngaba , kenya health ministry .
sir bernard pellegrin , head of f. c. o. africa desk .
may i convey her majesty's warmest greetings?
i thought that arnold was going up country .
he is .
oh , don't worry .
he's not gonna take me .
i've already asked him .
hmm .
good .
and , tessa yes?
i'd be happier if you stayed out of kibera , at least until the baby's born anyway .
um , just you wait until i'm single again .
hello , tim .
how are you?
hi .
are you struggling through without maude tonight?
one of her party headaches .
i take mine standing up .
oh , how manly of you .
isn't it just?
hello , arnold .
tessa .
hello , ghita , darling .
ooh , what a lovely sari .
interesting guests ; mr. donohue .
this is kenya ; dr. bluhm .
seems only fair to invite the odd native .
mmm .
the health minister's turn , was it?
so it seems .
who's that he's talking to?
i have no idea .
thought your spies knew everything , tim .
only god knows everything .
he works for mossad .
you've met dr. ngaba , have you?
yes , at the opening of a new state of the art clinic ... without autoclaves for sterilizing .
mmm .
probably converted them into a mercedes .
hmm .
i've never met an alchemist before .
tessa , darling .
ah , tessa .
hello , porter .
may i introduce tessa quayle , dr. ngaba , the wife of our representative for aid effectiveness?
pleasure to meet you .
how do you do?
and this is dr. bluhm from mdecins dans i'univers .
good evening .
dr. bluhm and i have met .
yes , it was at the opening for the clinic that didn't have the sterilizing equipment .
we never met ; dr. ngaba ; but i know your work .
do you know sir kenneth curtiss , chief executive ofthreebees?
yes ; also by reputation .
good evening .
good evening .
it's the most successful company here in kenya .
we're very proud ofhim .
and which of the bees are you?
you were going to show us the garden room , porter .
there is just one thing that i'd like to thank dr. ngaba for the free nevirapine .
he's , uh , persuaded the manufacturers to donate it to h. i. v. positive mothers .
it's a wonderful thing .
shall we?
the problem is , it isn't actually reaching them .
some , but not all .
so we've been wondering , is that a standard cock up , dr. ngaba , or or were the pills converted into the limo that you arrived in?
i think that's probably enough .
if you'll come through here , doctor .
justin .
excuse me .
you've gotta do something about tessa .
well , what would you like me to do , sandy?
well , she's embarrassing our guests .
her and that bloody bluhm .
there'll be hell to pay , i can tell you .
well , the the squall seems to have passed .
if you can't control her , you should keep her locked up .
you're wanted on the veranda ; mr. woodrow .
yes .
the poinsettias are so big here , they'll be best towards the back of the border .
hey , sexy .
you look divine .
sandy , i think you're a pervert .
stop looking at me like that .
we're to have a baby in a week .
can i come and visit you in the hospital?
you want to visit me in uhuru?
uhuru?
tessa , you're not having it there .
oh , sandy , come on .
kibera women have their babies there every day .
it's perfectly safe .
no , it's not .
it's madness .
just can i just choose wait a minute .
that looks a good one .
shall we run away?
yeah , come on then .
take me for lunch .
how are you?
i'm fine .
thank you .
how are you?
i'm fine .
thank you .
how are you?
how are you?
i'm fine .
thank you .
how are you?
i'm fine .
how are you?
look , near the car .
jomo is getting a test .
of course .
you told him to .
it was a suggestion , not an order .
what are they carrying in those littlejars?
it's probably saliva .
but that's not how you test for h. i. v. here ; is it?
they're also testing for t. b. why?
when they test for h. i. v. , they also test for t. b. free here .
what , just for free?
a small extra service to humanity .
they're a drug company , arnold .
come on .
no drug company does something for nothing .
is there ... something you're not telling me
arnold?
hello , sandy .
i'm so sorry , tessa .
gloria sends her sympathies .
what can one say?
it was a boy .
did justin already tell you that?
tessa .
tessa .
this one was born healthy though .
weren't you ; my beautiful ; beautiful darling?
his name is baraka .
it means blessing .
i ... don't quite see .
who the mother is?
her name is wanza kilulu .
she's 15 ; and she's dying .
kioko's 12 .
he walked 40 kilometers just to keep the flies off his sister and her baby .
perhaps that's the blessing .
darling ; please don't .
please sit here , mr. woodrow .
i'll wait outside .
thank you .
kioko , here you are .
you sweetheart .
justin , my darling , could you please go and get me a fresh bottle of water?
hmm?
sure .
now , sandy?
yes?
if i tell you something , will you listen to me?
not here , tessa .
no , sandy , if i tell you that that that that girl over there was being murdered , would you believe me?
tessa , you're tired .
you're feverish .
no .
no , i'm not .
now we haven't got all of the evidence yet , but when we get it , if i bring it to you , will you will you actually do something for once?
what you need is rest .
now what i'm i'm talking about are coincidences .
tessa , you've got to stop involving yourself in matters that don't concern you .
you're embarrassing the high commission , and you're not doing justin's career any good .
justin doesn't know what i do .
that doesn't surprise me .
sandy , you've got to promise me ... that you're going to act on what we tell you .
we?
me and arnold .
please?
all right .
i promise .
within reason .
within reason .
uh , there's a man .
she's raving mad .
you've got to get her to a proper clinic .
with white doctors , mr. woodrow?
for christ's sake , justin , she's your wife .
yes , she's my wife .
you see ; she's dead .
what did you give her?
it doesn't matter .
dr. lorbeer ; you have got to stop testing on patients with h. i. v.
it look at me .
i have to go .
justin , stop the car .
stop , stop , stop .
why?
what is it?
tessa .
it's 40 kilometers to miluri .
it's gonna take them all night .
we can't involve ourselves in their lives , tessa .
why?
be reasonable .
there are millions of people .
they all need help .
that's what the agencies are here for .
yeah , but these are three people that we can help .
please .
justin .
i'm sorry , tessa .
i have to put you first .
i have to get you home .
probably got enough there now ; mustafa .
yeah?
i think .
just the flowers this time , please .
you can spare the weeds .
the pest must eat too , bwana .
yes , i know .
if only they would .
they can eat the weeds .
look , you should be wearing gloves with that , you know?
and there's a mask if you want it .
okay .
it's an outrageous thing .
it's almost as if it's a it's a marriage of convenience shh .
tessa .
and the only thing it's gonna produce is dead offspring .
i'm sorry to interrupt .
what the fuck is that?
what?
i said , what the fuck is that?
tessa , it's pesticide .
it it's just unbelievable .
would you just get that thing out of this house?
well , if you feel that strongly about it , yes , tessa anything .
it would help if you might explain to me what's upsetting her .
i mean , this doesn't kill people , does it?
unless they swallow it?
no .
what?
then can you tell me why she's so
you have to trust her , justin .
it's hard , you know , when she we don't talk about
does she blame me for losing the baby?
of course not .
give her time .
tell her i'll be back later .
wherever there are drug companies ... testing their drugs on people who they think are expendable ; you'll find organizations like ours trying to fight back .
of course , the problem is that they have millions to spend on p. r ... while we work with volunteers and a few donated computers .
if you're gonna dig deeper ; then most of us have web sites .
check out oxfam ; m. s. f. ; health action international
put it in here .
just mind the roses , please , mustafa .
hi ; birgit .
sorry .
more questions .
tessa never sleeps .
always time for you , tessa .
take care of yourself ; tessa ; okay?
i think you're a bit [ german ]
i'm very tired .
i'm sorry .
i can't translate that word to you .
so you'd better ask that kind , nice husband of yours
okay .
see you ; tessa .
hi .
hi .
it's bloody awful weather .
you really shouldn't have waited up .
good .
then i think you should go to bed .
i'm safe home now , sweetheart .
no , you're drenched .
look , take those wet things off .
tessa , come to bed with me , please .
yeah , l
i will , but there's , um , something i have to do first .
it's important .
tessa , whatever it is that you and arnold are doing ;
i'd like it to stop .
wow .
who have you been talking to?
no one .
these are my concerns , all right?
i'm thinking of your health .
no .
no , you're not .
they've asked you to rein me in , and you're doing it .
it's just unbelievable .
what the hell are you talking about?
i hope you know me better than that .
your life is your own .
that was always our agreement .
no .
no , no .
the agreement was ... that my work was gonna be my own .
that's what makes me who i am .
i mean , if you stop me from doing my work , then i am nothing .
i'm just nobody .
l
i'm not trying to stop you doing anything .
please .
i'm sorry .
i'm just tired .
that's all .
very tired .
then come to bed .
hmm?
will you get me up for breakfast?
i've got to finish my report .
just smash it like that .
oh . !
right .
now if you just put those there .
you want probably to break them up into smaller pieces .
a bit more vermilion .
oh , you're just very blas , aren't you?
you know , just through feel .
no , i wouldn't no .
i wouldn't call it a parasite ; no .
you're gonna be late for your match .
quick , quick , quick , quick !
kenny , i can't discuss this on the phone .
that cow of yours wouldn't even give me an appointment .
time was you buggers couldn't get your tongues far enough up my arse .
what's changed?
hi .
if i find out that this has got anything to do with that bitch
come to my office .
l i've got to go , kenny .
bye .
having trouble with threebees , sandy?
just kenny being kenny .
oh .
nothing to do with my report then?
oh , he's just ranting .
oh , sandy , you promised me you were gonna do something .
i sent your report to london .
really?
yes .
to pellegrin?
yes .
and?
there was no official response .
well , what was there then?
well , just a personal letter .
that's all .
saying?
it's private .
what do you mean , it's private?
that's the most ridiculous thing i've ever heard .
i sent him an official document .
i gonna have to call pellegrin and ask him .
no , no .
don't do that , tessa .
why?
it's serious .
you know me well enough to know that i'm not gonna take no for an answer .
come on .
tessa ,
i'm supposed to keep an eye on you .
what?
report where you are , what you're doing .
trust me , tessa .
this is something that you should not pursue .
i say that as a friend who cares deeply for you .
sandy?
oh , tessa .
hi , gloria .
been wondering where you'd got to .
darling , you know , we really have to leave now .
match starts in half an hour .
harry's got a cricket match .
that is , you're still coming , right?
yes , of course .
you're not too busy , no?
one sec .
right .
okay .
justin's waiting for you in the car .
all right .
tell him i'll be right down .
sandy , what do you think of me?
i think you're beautiful .
do you?
yes .
really?
yes .
well , you can have me if you show me the letter .
ooh .
are you serious?
yeah .
when?
um , when i get back from loki .
tessa , if anyone ever found out [ car horn honks ]
i'd shown you the letter , i'd be ruined .
no one's gonna know , sandy .
put it back in the drawer .
lock the drawer .
put the key back .
read it at once .
promise?
promise .
my continent , africa , is staggering ... under the weight of not one , but three plagues .
yet still the governments of the u. s. a. and europe ; at the behest of the pharmaceutical companies that seem to control them ; drag their feet and continue to give us endless reasons ... why we should buy your branded drugs at five ; 10 ; 20 times the price .
sweetheart , don't bother to see us off .
it could be ages .
okay , well , if you're sure .
it's too hot to be standing around .
bye , arnold .
let me take your bag for you .
thank you .
bye , sweetheart .
see you in , uh in a couple of days .
tessa .
tessa?
yeah .
the bodies were locked inside a car and had been mutilated .
turn it off , will you?
certainly .
sorry .
mr. quayle . !
mustafa .
mmm .
tessa's family .
yes .
police were here ; bwana .
when?
this morning .
they took away mama tessa's things .
better make a list of what's missing .
mustafa .
see?
i told you .
they took away the cd's , the diskettes , the computer .
they came here and took the the files , the papers .
just didn't want to touch anything so that you can come and see for yourself what they did .
okay , thank you .
thank you , mustafa .
dypraxa?
huh .
darling tessa ; you have hurt me more than you know .
trusting you to be honorable ; i afforded you ; against all the rules ; an opportunity that you have abused in the worst way .
i beg you ; for the sake of my career ; to return what you took .
if you will not ; then at least save what is left of me ... by chucking in your ridiculous sham of a marriage ; as i will mine ; and bolting with me to the end of the earth .
i love you ; i love you ... and i love you .
sandy .
i'm sorry to have been so long , sandy .
seems they've been in here too .
anything missing in the bedroom?
her laptop's gone and her disks and all her files .
yes .
it's a mess .
what's in that?
oh , uh , her will , amongst other things .
oh .
seems she wanted to be buried in africa .
oh .
darling tessa .
hmm .
excuse me .
excuse me .
excuse me .
what are you doing?
could someone please explain what they're doing , please?
look , justin , it it's just concrete .
it's to keep the grave robbers out .
tessa expressed a wish to lie ... in african soil , not in bloody concrete .
nothing can grow in concrete .
kindly tell them to leave , please , ghita .
and you too , please , gentlemen .
thank you .
it was kind of you to come .
hello .
kioko .
it's kioko?
yes .
you're wanza's brother .
justin .
yes .
you brought a card for tessa?
yes .
you walked here?
did you walk?
thank you .
you'll always protect me ; won't you?
yeah .
of course .
of course i'll protect you .
and i'm gonna protect you .
justin?
hi .
you're a million miles away .
yes , i was .
um , i'm taking refuge in my nasturtium seeds .
listen , you know you know that i'm here for you , don't you?
yes , i do .
thank you , ghita .
you're a good friend .
i , uh i'm afraid i wanted to ask you a question .
rather a delicate question .
l well , maybe it's indelicate .
um anything .
what do you think that arnold and tessa were doing at lake turkana?
oh , i see .
you know , they did spend enough time together to give everyone the impression that they were
come on ; justin .
you know what this place is like .
if you can't have sex , you have other people's sex real or imagined .
who's this?
it's claude .
arnold's boyfriend .
i'd never have guessed .
it's illegal here .
you don't shout about it .
ah , well .
wish she could've told me .
perhaps she didn't think you needed to know .
tessa quayle i have ; but i have no wanza kilulu .
are you sure that is the right name?
uh , yes , wanza kilulu , and , uh , there was a white doctor attending to her , and he was there when she died .
perhaps he conducted the postmortem .
maybe you have a record of the postmortem .
if i have no patient's record , how can i have a postmortem record?
and we don't have european doctors working here .
right , but her name is definitely wanza kilulu , and i remember that she was well , if she does not appear in my records here
i'm sorry .
she does not i don't think she was yes .
no , i understand .
i mean , i'm not mad here .
she was in the bed .
okay , fine , yeah .
i'm sorry .
you want money?
fifty .
fifty .
fifty .
sorry .
he helped my wife , and i'm trying to find him .
i think he lives here , but i have no idea where he is .
it's a family .
you don't know him?
kioko kilulu .
kioko kilulu?
yes , a name .
do you know?
who is it?
who is it?
it's a family , from here .
a girl?
he's a young boy ; about 12 .
no?
kioko?
kioko , hello .
hello .
do do you remember me?
i've been looking for you .
no trouble .
you're not in trouble .
i just want to talk to you .
is this the clinic where wanza was treated?
i cannot help you without
next .
can i help you?
why why was that lady turned away?
she refuses treatment .
but she seemed to want to have treatment .
she's a t. b. patient who discontinued her treatment .
her card was canceled .
isn't that all the more reason to inoculate her child?
this is diphtheria vaccine .
what is your business here ; please?
my name is quayle .
i'm from the british high commission .
do you see any of your countrymen here , mr. quayle?
uh , excuse me one may i see your card , kioko?
i see .
this is in wanza's name .
that's the family it's a family medical card , right?
yes .
and what does " i. c. " mean?
it means informed consent .
it means they consented to treatment and have family medical entitlement .
and that treatment is dypraxa?
but if they don't give consent , then they lose the right to medical care?
it's not much of a choice ; is it?
i suppose they're not even informed that they're testing a new drug?
i don't make the rules ; mr. quayle .
mr. quayle?
yes?
will you please come with us?
kioko , there's your card .
thank you .
why is the child being questioned?
it's okay .
why did you come to talk to this boy?
he attended my wife's funeral , so i came to thank him .
for a diplomat , you're not a very good liar .
well , i haven't risen very high .
we know about your wife ; mr. quayle .
he was her lover this , uh , bluhm .
so people are pleased to tell me .
these men you hired to kill them
they rape and kill her , and they let him go .
where did you find them?
well , perhaps i asked a policeman .
can you tell me what i'm doing here , please?
we've been asked to ... keep you here .
right .
help us help you .
i'm sorry .
could you explain?
i have not acquired a taste for kenyan tea , i'm afraid .
look , we're trying to help you .
you help us , we help you .
if you give us something small , we can always say we didn't find you .
don't you believe i have the power to let you go?
can i help you?
yes .
my name is woodrow , acting head of mission for her majesty's government .
this is detective inspector deasey of scotland yard .
mr. deasey will be inquiring into the death of mr. quayle's wife .
if you have any questions , ask them of him .
is that clear?
you weren't mistreated?
no .
you know whose territory you are in ; mr. what did you say your name was?
and your name is?
right .
the , uh the boy kioko who i came to see
what have you done with him?
he ran away .
i hope nothing's happened to him .
where's your car , justin?
it's near the market .
is that the official thinking then that arnold killed tessa?
i'm afraid that's looking likely .
do you think that he was her lover?
i'm afraid that's looking likely too .
what were they doing up at lake turkana?
romantic setting .
sorry to have to say it , old chap .
but why suspect bluhm then?
i mean , there may have been others other lovers .
if she was an unfaithful wife ; why stop at arnold?
i wouldn't listen to rumor , unless you've evidence?
yes , evidence .
that's always the problem .
justin ; be a good chap and leave this to us .
there are proper channels for these things .
ghita ; hi .
thanks for coming .
so why did you want to meet here?
something that we shouldn't be seen talking about?
dypraxa .
i know that tessa and arnold wrote a report on the threebees trials , and i need to know what happened to it .
what makes you think i know?
because they trusted you , and so do i.
help me , please , ghita .
all i know is that tessa gave sandy a copy .
sandy?
why him?
sandy was a compromise semiofficial .
arnold wanted to go public with it .
tessa wouldn't .
because?
because she wanted to do it your way , through channels .
but , justin , i wouldn't bother looking for it .
if it threatens british commercial interests , it would've been shredded .
she could've brought it to me .
she didn't want to get you involved .
why?
ghita , why didn't she want me involved?
to protect you .
do you know if she showed the report to anyone else?
kenny curtiss .
time of the month , kenny?
fuck off .
might help if you took the fucking flag out .
well , get closer to the fucking hole , and maybe i will .
interesting man you got there , crick .
must be the only white caddy in africa .
look , kdh are waiting for me to default on my dypraxa commitments , and i have a cash flow problem .
what are you lot going to do about it?
we never promised to protect you commercially .
you protect me?
that's fucking rich .
a word or two from me in the right black ear , a couple of cases of krug , and you'd be on the next plane back home .
i mean , i spend more money on champagne in a year than your shop's annual fucking budget .
oh , there you go cause of your cash flow problem .
you're in my eyeline , old chap .
you're what passes forjames bond around here .
get her majesty's secret service to pull a few strings .
it's what you spies do , isn't it?
is it?
never really sure what it is we do .
don't even think about bullying me , old man .
i'm not a member of your gentlemen's club .
i don't have to play by the rules .
so it seems .
call that one in , shall we?
mr. curtiss , i'm sorry to disturb your game .
my name is justin quayle from the high commission .
i believe you knew my wife , tessa .
justin .
didn't know you were a member here .
yes , i met her at one of your parties .
she came to see you , i think .
she gave you a report that she had written on dypraxa .
justin , i really don't think this is the time or the place
i hope you didn't find her too troublesome , because she could be a terrier when she had a scent .
huh , sounds like you're describing a bitch .
i'm sorry about your loss , but i don't remember being given any report .
well , that's odd , because she noted it in her diary .
then you know more than i do .
didn't know ; uh didn't know tessa kept a diary .
well , i think tessa was right then , tim .
you don't know everything .
i know where you're going on tuesday .
next , please .
sorry about the weather .
it's hardly your fault .
oh , dear .
we've had some forgeries on the diplomatics .
i'm gonna have to keep this , i'm afraid , sir .
what?
the f. c. o. will issue you with a new one in a few days .
what if i want to travel with it?
just two , three days at the most .
are you saying that's a forgery?
it does happen ; sir ; even on diplomatics .
but that was issued to me a year ago by the diplomatic office sir , the f. c. o. will take care of that .
it's just here on the right .
good afternoon , sir .
good afternoon .
let me take that for you .
oh , i'd rather keep it with me .
uh ; club rule ; justin .
i'm sorry .
no no luggage in the , uh in the dining room .
could you just tuck it into your cubbyhole , please , jimmy?
thank you .
certainly , sir .
thank you , sir .
my dear fellow , what a dreadful time you've had .
welcome home .
thank you , bernard .
any , uh , plans , or is it too soon?
plans?
well , holiday , visiting friends , the million things you've always wanted to do in the garden .
mmm .
you're on indefinite sick leave .
enjoy it .
i hear the , uh the snow's very good at chamonix .
i don't have a passport , bernard .
they took mine at the airport .
oh , of course , yes .
you missed the , um you missed the recall .
mmm .
the sole meunire's not bad here , if if you like sole .
otherwise have it grilled .
grilled'll be fine .
um , no starters , i think .
you've been cleared , by the way .
thought we'd get that bit of unpleasantness dealt with first .
cleared for what?
um , of what .
uh , murder most foul .
seems you didn't hire contract killers in a den of vice after all .
deasey is satisfied it was a crime of passion by our dark medical horse .
it's just a question now of finding bluhm .
arnold bluhm is gay , bernard .
gay men don't rape their women friends .
well , i've known one or two very savage queens in my time .
do you no good to go poking around under rocks , justin .
some very nasty things live under rocks ; especially in foreign gardens .
advice of a friend .
what is it that i'm not to look into , bernard?
quayles have always made reliable foreign service men .
shouldn't be surprised if you've still got a small head of mission in your knapsack .
challenging post .
more challenging than dealing with kenny curtiss?
he's a crude sort of chap , our kenny , but he flies the flag for us .
he got up dear tessa's nose , i fear .
yes , she wrote a report about it .
about kenny?
no , about dypraxa .
ah ; that .
she expected some action to be taken , but none was , was it?
she tell you about the letter , or did you find it among her things?
tucked into her diary ; perhaps?
what letter is that , bernard?
ramblings of an aging fart .
senility setting in early , alas .
naughty of her to take it though .
very naughty indeed .
yes , i found that .
be grateful to have it back .
written under stress , you understand .
regrettable things said .
wouldn't want it falling into the wrong hands .
sorry , bernard .
are we talking about the same letter?
what's yours about?
undying love .
ah .
what's yours?
they're not so good grilled .
you should've had the meunire .
ladies and gentlemen
ladies and gentlemen ; please keep all your belongings with you at all times .
it's good to see you , ham .
sorry about the blubbing .
it's those bloody latin genes , you know .
it's the same old ham .
oh , no .
no , not anymore .
god , i loved her rotten .
and she loved you rotten .
first cousins can be closer than siblings .
i still don't understand why i let you talk me out of going to the funeral .
it was the wrong crowd for you , ham .
we'll have a private memorial service here .
you can blub all your way through it .
don't think i won't .
hire the abbey .
you can afford it now .
can i?
tess left you bloody well off .
want to know what you're worth?
not particularly .
oh , i've got the keys to the chelsea house .
thought you might want to stay there while you're in london .
no , i'd rather not .
well , it's all yours .
that and her african women's charity .
said it would get you out of the garden .
when did she say that?
two weeks before she died .
look , i am ravenous .
have you had lunch?
yes , i have .
a very civilized lunch with bernard pellegrin ... who expressed an interest in tessa's diary .
but tess never kept a diary .
she hated the things .
you and i know that .
pellegrin must have been disinformed .
tess thought she was being watched .
didn't stop her e mailing twice a day .
more inquiries than google .
look at him .
the boy is two thirds machine .
i'm telling you ; it's scary .
mind of a computer .
appetite of a waste disposal .
and what's the other third?
oh , manzini , unquestionably .
those e mails from tess guido helped me with them .
company stuff .
boring .
mm .
ownership , franchises , that sort of thing .
i'm trying to find out who brokered the marriage .
what marriage?
kdh and threebees .
kdh make dypraxa .
threebees test it .
it's a marriage of convenience , of course .
both in it for what they can get out of it .
that phrase about the marriage is that tess's phrase or yours?
oh , hers .
hers .
producing dead offspring .
oh , this is so good !
why don't you try some .
it looks disgusting .
i can get that stuff through her mirror server .
well , how do you do that?
all you need is the password .
duh .
yeah , but i don't have her password .
come on , jus .
five letters .
three guesses .
i have no idea .
my name guido .
she used the one for the " l " and the zero for the " o.
i set it up for her .
wait , wait .
give him a chance to read it .
lightning tour .
i'm printing as i go .
what's hippo?
oh ; i know that one .
german german pharma watch .
keep an eye on what the drug companies are up to .
copy that .
kdh .
can we open that?
sure .
no problem .
a new plague is sweeping the world .
in the 21 st century , multi resistant t. b. will kill one in three .
but now there is hope .
it's huge , isn't it?
kdh is developing a revolutionary treatment for t. b. sufferers .
it's global .
we call it dypraxa .
you will call it life .
and i call it a blockbuster .
karel delacourt hudson .
the world is our clinic .
it's gonna sell like hotcakes .
can you magnify that photograph?
magnify it?
he can send it out for doughnuts .
is it possible to zoom in on it?
yeah , sure .
it's pellegrin .
why is he there?
