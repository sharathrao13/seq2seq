let me tell you what " like a virgin " is about .
it's all about a girl who digs a guy with a big dick .
the entire song is a metaphor for big dicks .
no , it ain't .
it's about a girl who's very vulnerable .
she's been fucked over a few times and she meets a guy who's sensitive .
whoa .
timeout .
tell that bullshit to the tourists .
toby?
who the fuck is toby?
like a virgin " is not about some sensitive girl who meets a nice fella .
that's what " true blue " is about .
no argument about that .
which one is " true blue "?
it was a big ass hit for madonna .
i don't even follow that top of the pops shit , and i've heard of " true blue .
i didn't say i ain't heard of it .
all i asked is , how's it go?
excuse me for not being the world's biggest madonna fan .
personally , i can do without her .
i used to like her early stuff , " borderline " ... but once she got off with that " papa , don't preach " phase , i tuned out .
hey , you guys are making me lose my train of thought here .
i was sayin 'something .
what was it?
oh , toby's that little chinese girl .
what was her last name?
what's that?
it's an old address book i found in a coat i haven't worn in a coon's age .
what was that name?
what the fuck was i talkin 'about?
you said " true blue " was about a guy a sensitive girl who meets a nice guy ... but " like a virgin " was a metaphor for big dicks .
let me tell you what " like a virgin " is about .
it's all about this cooze who's a regular fuck machine .
i'm talkin 'morning , day , night , afternoon ... dick , dick , dick , dick , dick , dick , dick , dick , dick !
how many " dicks " is that?
a lot .
then one day , she meets this john holmes motherfucker .
it's like , " whoa , baby . " he's like charles bronson in " the great escape .
he's diggin 'tunnels .
now she's gettin 'serious dick action .
she's feelin 'somethin 'she ain't felt since forever : pain , pain .
chew?
toby chew?
it hurts .
it hurts her .
it shouldn't hurt her .
her pussy should be bubble yum by now .
but when this cat fucks her , it hurts .
it hurts just like it did the first time .
you see , the pain is reminding a fuck machine ... what it was once like to be a virgin .
hence , " like a virgin .
wong .
give me that fuckin 'thing .
what in hell do you think you're doin '?
i'm sick of hearin 'it , joe .
i'll give it back to you when we leave .
what do you mean , when we leave?
give me it back now !
for the past 15 minutes now , you've been droning on about names .
toby .
toby?
toby?
toby wong .
toby wong?
toby wong .
toby chung fuckin 'charlie chan .
i've got madonna's big dick comin 'out of my left ear ... and toby the jap i don't know what comin 'out of my right .
give me that book .
are you gonna put it away?
i'm gonna do whatever the fuck i want with it .
well , then i'm afraid i'm gonna have to keep it .
hey , joe , want me to shoot this guy?
shit .
you shoot me in a dream , you better wake up and apologize .
you guys been listenin 'to k bllly's " super sounds of the '70s " weekend?
yeah .
that's fuckin 'great .
you believe the songs they're playin '?
know what i heard the other day?
heartbeat , it's a lovebeat " by little tony defranco and the defranco family .
i haven't heard that song since i was in the fifth fuckin 'grade .
when i was comin 'down here , " the night the lights went out in georgia " came on .
i ain't heard that song since it was big .
but when it was big , i must've heard it a million trillion fuckin 'times .
but this is the first time i ever realized ... that the girl singin 'the song is the one who shot andy .
you didn't know that vickie lawrence was the one who shot andy?
i thought the cheatin 'wife shot andy .
they say that at the end of the song .
i know , motherfucker .
i just heard it .
that's what i'm talkin 'about .
i must've zoned out during that part before .
all right , i'll take care of the check .
all right , i'll take care of the check .
you guys can get the tip .
should be about a buck apiece .
and you , when i come back i want my book .
sorry .
it's my book now .
hey , i changed my mind .
shoot this piece of shit , will ya?
all right , everybody cough up some green for the little lady .
come on , throw in a buck .
i don't tip .
you don't tip?
i don't believe in it .
you don't believe in tipping?
do you know what these chicks make?
they make shit .
if she don't make enough money , she can quit .
i don't even know a fuckin 'jew who'd have the balls to say that .
let me get this straight .
you don't ever tip , huh?
i don't tip because society says i have to .
if they really put forth the effort , i'll give 'em somethin 'extra .
but this tipping automatically , it's for the birds .
as far as i'm concerned , they're just doin 'their job .
this girl was nice .
she was okay .
she wasn't anything special .
what's special?
take you in the back and suck your dick?
i'd go over 12 % for that .
i ordered coffee , all right?
she's only filled my cup three times .
i want it filled six times .
six times?
well , what if she's too fuckin 'busy?
the words " too fuckin 'busy " shouldn't be in a waitress's vocabulary .
excuse me , mr. pink , but the last fuckin 'thing you need's ... another cup of coffee .
these ladies aren't starvin 'to death .
they make minimum wage .
i used to work minimum wage , and when i did ...
i wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tip worthy .
you don't care they're countin 'on your tips to live?
you know what this is?
the world's smallest violin , playin 'just for the waitresses .
you don't have any idea what you're talkin 'about .
these people bust their ass .
this is a hard job .
so's working at mcdonald's , but you don't feel the need to tip them .
they're servin 'you food , but society says ...
don't tip these guys over here , but tip these guys . " that's bullshit .
waitressing is the number one occupation ... for female non college graduates in this country .
it's the one job basically any woman can get and make a living on .
the reason is because of their tips .
fuck all that .
i'm very sorry the government taxes their tips .
that's fucked up .
that ain't my fault .
it would appear that waitresses are one of the many groups ... the government fucks in the ass on a regular basis .
show me a paper that says the government shouldn't do that , i'll sign it .
i'll vote for it .
but what i won't do is play ball .
learn to fuckin 'type .
if you're expectin 'me to help out with the rent , you're in for a big surprise .
he's convinced me .
give me my dollar back .
hey .
leave the dollars there .
all right , ramblers , let's get ramblin '.
wait a minute .
who didn't throw in?
mr. pink .
mr. pink?
why not?
he don't tip .
he don't tip?
you don't tip?
he don't believe in it .
shut up .
what do you mean , you don't believe in it?
cough up a buck , you cheap bastard .
i paid for your goddamn breakfast .
since you bought breakfast , i'll put in .
but normally i would never do this .
never mind what you normally would do .
just cough in your goddamn buck like everybody else .
thank you .
that was the partridge family's " doesn't somebody want to be wanted? " ... followed by edison lighthouse's ...
love grows where my rosemary goes " ... as k bllly's " super sounds of the '70s " weekend ... just keeps on truckin '. just keeps on truckin '.
i'm gonna die .
i'm gonna die !
just hold on , buddy boy !
i'm gonna die !
i'm sorry !
give me your hand .
i can't believe she killed me , man !
who'd have fuckin 'thought that?
hey , just cancel that shit right now !
you're hurt .
you're hurt real fuckin 'bad , but you ain't dying !
all this blood's scarin 'the shit out of me , larry !
i'm gonna die !
i know it !
excuse me , i didn't realize you had a degree in medicine .
are you a doctor?
are you a doctor?
answer me , please !
are you a doctor?
no , i'm not .
i'm not .
so you admit you don't know what you're talkin 'about .
if you're through givin 'me your amateur opinion , lie back and listen .
i'm takin 'you back to the rendezvous , joe's gonna get you a doctor ... the doctor's gonna fix you up and ... you're gonna be okay .
now say it !
you're gonna be okay !
say it !
you're gonna be okay !
say the goddamn words !
you're gonna be okay !
oh , god !
say the goddamn fuckin 'words !
say it !
okay , larry .
correct !
correct !
i'm okay .
look where we are .
look where we are .
she had a baby , man .
she had a baby !
we're in a warehouse .
who's a tough guy?
who's a tough guy?
come on , who's a tough guy?
who's a tough guy?
you're a tough guy .
you're a fuckin 'tough guy .
we're in a warehouse .
look where we are .
we made it .
we made it .
we fuckin 'made it .
we have fuckin 'made it .
we're in a warehouse .
look where we are .
look where we are .
hold on .
hold on .
shit !
stop bangin 'your head .
you're gonna bang a fuckin 'hole in the floor .
you don't wanna hurt the fuckin 'floor , do you?
i can't do anything for you .
but when joe gets here ... which should be any time now ... he's gonna help you out , he's gonna take care of you .
we're gonna sit and wait for joe .
who are we waitin 'for?
joe .
larry , i'm fucking scared , man .
would you please hold me?
yeah , sure .
you go ahead and be scared .
you've been brave enough for one day .
i just want you to relax now , okay?
you're not gonna fuckin 'die .
you're gonna be fine .
when joe gets here , he'll make you 100 % again .
am i hurt?
i'm hurt bad , larry .
it's not good , no .
hey , larry ... bless your heart for what you're tryin 'to do .
i was panicking for a minute back there .
but i got my senses back now .
the situation is , i'm shot in the belly .
without medical attention , i'm gonna die .
i can't take you to a hospital .
fuck jail , man !
you don't have to take me in .
just drive me up to the front , man .
just drop me on the sidewalk .
i'll take care of myself .
i won't tell 'em anything , man .
i won't tell 'em anything .
i swear to fucking god , man .
just look in my eyes , larry .
look in my eyes .
i won't tell them anything .
you'll be safe , man .
you're not gonna fuckin 'die , kid .
all right?
listen to me .
you're gonna be fine .
along with the kneecap ... the gut is the most painful area a guy can get shot in .
no shit !
but it takes a long time to die from it .
i'm talkin 'days .
you're gonna wish you were dead , but it takes days to die from your wound .
time is on your side .
was that a fucking setup , or what?
shit .
orange got tagged?
gut shot .
fuck .
where's brown?
dead .
how did he die?
how the fuck do you think?
the cops shot him .
this is bad .
this is so fucking bad .
is it bad?
as opposed to good?
man , this is fucked up .
this is so fucked up .
somebody fucked us up big time , man .
you really think we were set up?
do you even doubt it , man?
i don't think we got set up , i know it .
where did all those cops come from , huh?
one minute they're not there , and the next minute they're there .
i didn't hear any sirens .
the alarm went off , okay?
when an alarm goes , you got a four minute response time .
unless a patrol car is cruising that street at that moment ... you got four minutes before they can realistically respond .
in one minute , there were 17 blue boys out there ... all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing , and they were all there !
remember that second wave that showed up in the cars?
those were the ones responding to the alarm , but those first motherfuckers ... they were there and they were waitin 'for us .
haven't you fuckin 'thought about this?
i haven't had a chance to think .
first i was just tryin 'to get the fuck outta there .
and after we got away , i've just been dealin 'with him .
better start thinkin 'about it , 'cause that's all i'm thinkin 'about .
i wasn't even gonna come here .
i was just gonna drive off , man ... because whoever set us up knows about this place .
there could've been cops here waitin '!
there could be cops comin 'right now !
let's go in the other room .
hey .
in there .
larry , don't leave me .
i'll be right in the other room , okay?
i'll be right there lookin 'at ya .
i'm right here lookin 'at you , okay?
i'm right over there .
larry ...
i'm gonna fucking die .
larry .
what the fuck am i doin 'here , man?
i felt funny about this job right off .
as soon as i felt it i should have said , " no , thank you , " but i never listen .
every time i ever got fucked buying weed , the same thing .
i didn't trust the guy , but i wanted to believe him .
if he's not lying and it really is thai stick , then it's great .
but it never is , and i always said that if i felt that about a job , i'd walk .
and i didn't .
i didn't because of the fuckin 'money !
what's done is done .
i need you cool .
are you cool?
i'm cool .
splash some water on your face .
take a breather .
relax .
have a cigarette .
i quit .
all right .
why , you got one?
okay , let's go through what happened .
we're in the place , everything's going fine .
then the alarm gets tripped .
i turn around and all these cops are outside .
you're right .
it was like , bam , i blinked my eyes and they're there .
everybody starts going ape shit .
then mr. blonde starts to shoot all
that's not correct .
what's wrong with it?
okay .
the cops did not show up after the alarm went off .
the cops didn't show up until after mr. blonde started shootin 'everybody .
soon as i heard the alarm , i saw cops .
it wasn't that soon .
they didn't let their presence be known until after mr. blonde became a madman .
i'm not sayin 'they weren't there .
i'm sayin 'they were there .
but they didn't make a move until after mr. blonde started shootin 'everybody .
i mean , that's how i know we were set up .
mr. white , you can see that  enough of this " mr. white " shit .
wait !
don't tell me you're fuckin 'name !
i don't wanna know it !
jesus christ , i ain't gonna tell you mine .
you're right .
this is bad .
how did you get out?
i shot my way out .
everybody started shootin ', so i blasted my way out of there .
move it !
get outta the way !
get the fuck outta the way !
get the fuck outta the way !
move it !
get outta the way !
jesus christ !
what the fuck is your problem , man?
you fuckin 'asshole !
fuck you !
move !
jesus !
get outta the car !
get the fuck outta the car !
move it !
move outta the way !
i tagged a couple of cops .
did you kill anybody?
a few cops .
no real people?
just cops .
could you believe mr. blonde?
that was the most insane fuckin 'thing i have ever seen .
why the fuck would joe hire a guy like that?
i don't want to kill anybody .
if i gotta get out that door and you're standin 'in my way ... one way or the other you're gettin 'outta my way .
that's the way i look at it .
the choice between doin 'ten years ... and takin 'out some stupid motherfucker ... ain't no choice at all .
but i ain't no madman , either .
what the fuck was joe thinkin '?
you can't work with a guy like that .
we're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us when he shot the place up .
i came this close to takin 'his ass out myself .
i mean , everybody panics .
everybody .
things get tense .
it's human nature .
you panic .
i don't care what your name is , you can't help it .
fuck , man , you panic on the inside , in your head , you know?
you give yourself a couple of seconds , get ahold of it and deal with it .
what you don't do is start shootin 'up the place and start killin 'people .
what you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin 'professional .
a psychopath ain't a professional .
you can't work with a psychopath .
you don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next .
i mean , jesus christ , how old do you think that black girl was?
twenty?
maybe 21?
if that .
did you see what happened to anybody else?
me and orange jumped in the car , brown floored it .
after that , i don't know what went down .
it was every man for himself .
as far as mr. blonde and mr. blue are concerned , i ain't got the foggiest ...
'cause once i got out , i never looked back .
what do you think?
what do i think?
the cops either caught 'em or killed 'em .
no chance they punched through?
you found a hole .
yeah , and that was a fuckin 'miracle .
but even if they did get away , then where the fuck are they?
you don't think it's possible one of 'em got ahold of the diamonds and
no , no way .
how can you be so sure?
i got the diamonds .
that's my boy .
where?
i stashed 'em .
if you wanna come with me , let's go get 'em right now , this second .
'cause i think stayin 'here , man , we should have our fuckin 'heads examined .
that was the plan .
we meet here .
then where the fuck is everybody?
i say the plan becomes null and void once we found out we got a rat here .
we ain't got the slightest idea what happened to mr. blonde or mr. blue .
they could both be dead or maybe they're arrested .
the cops could have 'em right now at the station , sweatin ''em down .
they don't know our names , but they could be singin 'about this place .
i swear to god , i think i'm fuckin 'jinxed .
what?
two jobs back , it was a four man job .
we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop .
no shit?
thank god we discovered in time .
we had to forget the whole thing , just walk the fuck away from it .
so who's the rat this time?
mr. blue?
mr. brown?
joe?
joe set this whole thing up .
maybe he set it up to set it up .
i don't buy it .
me and joe go back a long time .
i can tell you definitely , joe didn't know a thing about this bullshit .
i know joe , and me sayin 'he definitely had nothin 'to do with it is ridiculous .
i can say i definitely didn't do it , 'cause i know what i did or didn't do .
but i cannot definitely say that about anybody , 'cause i don't definitely know .
for all i know , you're the rat .
for all i know , you're the fuckin 'rat !
all right , now you're usin 'your fuckin 'head .
for all we know , he's the rat .
that kid in there is dying from a fuckin 'bullet i saw him take ... so don't you be calling him a rat !
look , i'm right , okay?
somebody's a fuckin 'rat .
where's the commode in this dungeon?
i gotta take a squirt .
go down the hall , make a left , go up the stairs ... and make a right .
by the way , how's alabama?
alabama?
i haven't seen bama in over a year and a half .
but i thought you two were a team .
we were for a little while .
did about four jobs together , then decided to call it quits .
why?
you push that woman man thing too long and it gets to you after a while .
what's she doin 'now?
she hooked up with frank mcgar .
they've done a couple jobs together .
hell of a woman .
good little thief .
so explain the telegram .
five man job .
bustin 'in and bustin 'out of a diamond wholesaler's .
can you move the ice afterwards?
i don't know nobody that can move ice .
no problem .
we got guys waitin 'for it .
what happened to marcellus spivey?
didn't he always move your ice?
he's doin '20 years in susanville .
twenty years?
holy god .
what for?
bad luck .
i guess you can say that again .
what's the exposure like?
two minutes , tops .
but it's a tough two minutes .
daylight , during business hours , dealing with a crowd .
but you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd .
how many employees?
i'd say around 20 .
security pretty lax .
they most usually just deal in boxes .
you know , uncut stones from the diamond syndicate .
but on this day , they're getting a shipment of polished stones from lsrael .
they're like a way station , you know?
they get picked up and sent to vermont .
no , they're not .
what's the cut , poppa?
juicy , junior .
real juicy .
look , man , you do what you want .
i'm outta here , man .
i'm gonna check into a motel for a few days .
you know , i'll lay low and i'll call joe
shit .
did he fuckin 'die on us?
huh? ls he dead or what?
he ain't dead .
what is it?
i think he's just passed out .
he scared the fuckin 'shit outta me .
i thought he was dead for sure .
without medical attention , he will die for sure .
what are we gonna do , man?
we can't take him to the hospital .
without medical attention , he might not live through the night .
the bullet in his belly is my fault .
while that might not mean jack shit to you , it means a hell of a lot to me .
first things first , okay?
stayin 'here's goofy .
we gotta book up .
so what do you suggest we do?
go to a hotel?
we got a guy who's shot in the belly , who can't walk , bleeds like a stuck pig .
and when he's awake , he screams in pain .
you got an idea , spit it out .
joe could help .
if we could get in touch with joe , joe could get him to a doctor .
joe could get a doctor to come to see him .
assuming we can trust joe , how we gonna get in touch with him?
he's supposed to be here , but he ain't , which makes me nervous about bein 'here .
even if he is on the up and up , i don't think he's gonna be too happy with us .
he planned a robbery and he's got a bloodbath on his hands now .
he's got dead cops , dead robbers , dead civilians .
i tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight .
if i was him , i'd put as much distance between me and this mess as possible .
before you got here , mr. orange ... was askin 'me to take him to a doctor , to a hospital .
i don't like the idea of turnin 'him over to the cops ... but if we don't , he's gonna die .
he begged me to do it .
well , all right .
then i guess we take him to a hospital .
if that's what he said , let's do it .
since he don't know nothin 'about us , i say it's his decision .
he knows a little about me .
what?
wait , wait .
you didn't tell him your name , did you?
i told him my first name and where i was from .
why?
i told him where i was from a few days ago .
it was just a natural conversation .
what was tellin 'him your name when you weren't supposed to?
he asked .
we had just gotten away from the cops .
he just got shot .
it was my fault he got shot .
he's a fuckin 'bloody mess .
he's screamin '.
i swear to god , i thought he was gonna die right then and there .
i'm tryin 'to comfort him , telling him not to worry ... everything's going to be okay , i'm gonna take care of him .
and he asked me what my name was .
i mean , the man was dyin 'in my arms .
what the fuck was i supposed to do?
tell him i'm sorry?
i can't give out that fuckin 'information?
it's against the rules?
i don't trust you enough?
maybe i should've , but i couldn't .
fuck you !
fuck joe !
i'm sure it was a beautiful scene .
don't fuckin 'patronize me !
i have one question .
do they have a sheet on you where you're from?
yeah !
that's that , then .
i mean , i was worried about mug shot possibility as it was .
he knows a , your name , b , your face , c , your hometown and d , your specialty .
they're not gonna have to show him a lot of pictures for him to pick you out !
you didn't tell him anything else so they could narrow down the selection?
if i have to tell you again to back off , we're gonna go 'round and 'round .
we ain't takin 'him to a hospital .
if we don't , he's gonna die .
and i'm very sad about that , but some fellas are lucky and some ain't .
what the fuck are you touchin 'me for , man?
i'll show you who you're fuckin 'with !
you wanna shoot me , you piece of shit?
i didn't create this situation , i'm dealin 'with it !
you're actin 'like a first year thief !
i'm actin 'like a professional !
if they get him , they could get you , they could get closer to me ... and that can't happen !
you're lookin 'at me like it's my fault?
i didn't tell him my name !
i didn't tell him where i was from !
shit !
fifteen minutes ago you almost told me your name !
you're gonna get stuck in a situation you created !
so if you wanna throw bad looks around , throw 'em at a mirror !
you kids shouldn't play so rough .
somebody's gonna start cryin '.
mr. blonde .
shit .
you're fuckin 'kickin 'me .
what happened to you?
figured you were dead .
hey , you okay?
did you see what happened to blue?
we didn't know what happened to you .
that's what we were wonderin 'about .
look , brown is dead , orange got it in the belly .
enough !
enough !
you better start talkin ', asshole .
'cause we got shit we need to talk about .
we're already freaked out .
we need you actin 'freaky like we need a fuckin 'bag on our hip .
okay , let's talk .
we think we got a rat in the house .
i guarantee we got a rat in the house .
what makes you say that?
is that supposed to be funny?
look , we think this place ain't safe .
this place ain't secure anymore .
we're leavin 'and you should go with us .
nobody's goin 'anywhere .
piss on this fuckin 'turd .
we're outta here .
don't take another step , mr. white .
fuck you , maniac !
it's your fuckin 'fault we're in this trouble !
what's this guy's problem?
what's my problem?
yeah , i got a fuckin 'problem !
i got a big fuckin 'problem ... with any trigger happy madman who almost gets me shot !
what the fuck you talkin 'about?
that fucking shooting spree !
in the store !
remember?
oh , fuck 'em .
they set off the alarm .
they deserve what they got .
you almost killed me !
asshole !
if i knew what kind of guy you were , i never would've agreed to work with you .
are you gonna bark all day , little doggie ... or are you gonna bite?
what was that?
i'm sorry , i didn't catch it .
would you repeat it?
are you gonna bark all day , little doggie ... or are you gonna bite?
you two assholes , calm the fuck down !
hey , come on !
what , are we on a playground here?
am i the only professional?
you're actin 'like a bunch of fuckin 'niggers !

always sayin 'they're gonna kill each other .
you said yourself you thought about taking him out .
you fuckin 'said that?
yeah , i did , okay?
but that was then .
right now , this guy is the only one i completely trust .
he's too homicidal to be with the cops .
you takin 'his side?
fuck sides , man !
what we need here is solidarity !
somebody's stickin 'a red hot poker up our ass , and i want to know who .
fuck .
look , i know i'm no piece of shit .
i'm pretty sure you're okay , and i'm fuckin 'positive you're on the level .
so let's try and figure out who the bad guy is , all right?
wow .
that was really exciting .
i bet you're a big lee marvin fan , aren't ya?
yeah , me too .
i love that guy .
my heart's beatin 'so fast , i'm about to have a heart attack here .
i got somethin 'outside that i'd like to show you guys , so follow me .

we're gonna stick around and we're gonna wait .

the cops?
no .
nice guy eddie .
nice guy eddie?
what makes you think he isn't on a plane halfway to costa rica?
because i spoke to him on the phone and he said he's on the way down here .
you talked to nice guy eddie?
why didn't you say that in the first place?
'cause you never asked me .
hardy fuckin 'har .
what'd he say?
he said stay put .
so in the meantime ...
i'll show you guys somethin '.
jesus christ .
maybe our boy in blue here can answer some of these questions ... about this rat business you've been talkin 'about .
you're a piece of work , my friend .
let's get him the fuck outta here .
hey , sid , will you relax?
i've known you a long time .
i'm not worried .
i know you'll pay me back .
don't tell me what i already know .
don't embarrass me .
so you had a few bad months .
you do what everybody else does .
i don't care if it's j. p. morgan or lrving the tailor .

a friend of mine's outside .

it's a change .
ain't that the sad truth .
sit down , take your coat off , make yourself at home .
have a little drink?
yeah .
how about a little remy martin?
sure .
who's your parole officer?
seymour scagnetti .
how is he?
he's a fuckin 'asshole .
won't even let me leave the halfway house .
it never ceases to amaze me .
a fuckin 'jungle bunny goes out there , slits a woman's throat for 25 cents ... he gets doris day for a parole officer .
a good fella like you winds up with a ball bustin 'prick .
i want you to know i appreciate all the packages you sent me on the inside .
what the hell was i supposed to do?
forget about you?
i just want you to know that it meant a lot to me .
it was the least i could do .
i wish to hell i could've done a lot more .
thanks a lot , joe .
ah , vic .
toothpick vic .
so tell me your story , kid .
what are your plans?
you son of a bitch .
i see you sittin 'there , but i don't believe it .
how you doin ', toothpick?
hey , eddie .
listen , i'm sorry .
i should've picked you up myself .
i was my fuckin 'this week's been crazy .
i've had my head up my ass the whole time .
funny you say that , 'cause that's what me and your daddy were talkin 'about .
that i should've picked you up?
no , that you had your head up your ass .
i walk in the door , he's like , " vic , vic ...
i'm so glad somebody's finally here who knows what's goin 'on .
my son eddie's a fuck up .
he's ruining the business .
i mean , i love the guy , but he's flushin 'everything down the toilet .
that's what you said , right , joe?
tell him yourself .
eddie , i hate for you to hear it like this ... but vic came in and asked me how business was .
you don't lie to a guy who's just done four years in the slammer .
that's very true .
all right , enough of this shit !
break it up !
come on , this ain't a playground !
you guys wanna roll around on the floor , you do it in eddie's office , not mine .
daddy , did you see that?
what?
the guy got me on the ground , he tried to fuck me .
you wish .
you sick bastard , vic .
you tried to fuck me in my father's office .
look , vic , whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home ... go to it , but don't try to fuck me .
i don't think of you that way .
i like you a lot , buddy , but i don't think of you that way .
listen , if i was a butt cowboy , i wouldn't even throw you to the posse .
no , you wouldn't .
you'd keep me for yourself .
four years fuckin 'punks up the ass , you'd appreciate a piece of prime rib .
i might break you in , nice guy , but i'd make you my dog's bitch .
ain't that a sad sight , daddy?
a man walks into prison a white man , walks out talkin 'like a fuckin 'nigger .
you know what?
i think it's all that black semen ... pumped up your asshole , now it's backed into your fuckin 'brain ... and it's comin 'out your mouth !
eddie , you keep talkin 'like a bitch , i'm gonna slap you like a bitch .
enough of that shit !
i'm sick of it !
now both of you , sit down .
now , eddie ... when you came in here , we were talkin 'some serious business .
vic here's got a parole problem .
who's your p. o.?
seymour scagnetti .
scagnetti .
fuck .
i hear he's a motherfucker .
oh , he's a fucker .
won't even let me leave the halfway house unless i get some shitty job .
you're comin 'back to work for us , right?
well , i wanna .
but first i gotta prove to , uh , ass head ... that i can get a regular , you know , job type job ... before i can move out on my own .
i can't come back to work for you guys if i gotta worry about , uh ... makin 'some silly ass 10 : 00 curfew ... every fuckin 'night .
we can work this out , can't we , eddie?
this ain't all that bad .
we can get you a lot of legitimate jobs .
i'll get you down in long beach as a dockworker .
i don't wanna lift no fuckin 'crates , eddie .
you ain't gonna lift shit .
you don't even work there .
but as far as the records are concerned , you do .
i call matthews and tell him he's got a new guy , boom , you're on the rotation .
you get a time card .
it's clocked in and out for you every day .
at the end of the week you get a nice paycheck .
dockworkers do very well .
you can move into a halfway decent place without scagnetti goin '...
where the fuck's the money comin 'from?
and , if he decides to make a surprise visit ... that's the day we sent you to tustin to pick up a load of shit .
if he comes back again , hey , " sorry , seymour .
you just missed him .
we had to send him to the taft airstrip five fuckin 'hours away .
we had a load of shit he had to pick up there and bring back here .
part of your job is goin 'different places .
that's the beauty of it .
we got places all over the place .
see , vic?
did i tell you not to worry?
vic was worried .
i'll take you to long beach tomorrow .
we'll get you fixed up with matthews , i'll tell him what's what .
you know , i really appreciate what you guys are doin '... but i'd like to know when i can come back ... you know , do some real work .
well , it's hard to say .
it's kind of a strange time now .
things are kind of
they're a little fucked up , is what they are .
we're just gettin 'ready for a big meetin 'right now in vegas .
look , just let eddie for now set you up at long beach .
get you a job , give you some cash ... and get this scagnetti fuck off your back ... and then we'll talk to you , all right?
huh?
dad , i got an idea .
just hear me out .
i know you don't like usin 'the boys on these jobs ... but vic here i mean , he's only been nothin 'but good luck for us .
the guy's a fuckin 'rabbit's foot , for cryin 'out loud .
i'd like to have him in .
you know he can handle himself , and you damn sure know you can trust him .
all right , vic ... how would you feel about pullin 'a job with about five other guys?
i'd feel great about it .
k bllly's " super sounds of the '70s " continues .
if you're the 12th caller ... you'll win two tickets to the monster truck extravaganza ... being held tonight at the carson fairgrounds ... featuring big daddy don bodine's truck , " the behemoth .
the 12th caller wins on the station where the '70s survived .
hey , dov , we got a major situation here .
i know you know that .
i gotta talk to daddy and find out what he wants done .
all i know is what vic told me .
the place turned into a bullet fest .
he took a cop hostage just to get the fuck outta there .
get up !
get up !
do i sound like i'm fuckin 'jokin '?
he's fuckin 'drivin 'around with a cop in his trunk !
i don't know who did what !
i don't know who's got the loot .
i don't know if anybody's got the loot .
i don't know who's dead , who's alive , who's caught , who's not .
i will know .
i'm practically there now .
but what do i tell these guys about daddy?
all right .
you sure that's what he said?
okay , that's what i'll tell 'em .
huh?
fuck you !
you like bein 'a fuckin 'hero?
you like bein 'a fuckin 'hero?
you like bein 'a fuckin 'hero?
you're gonna suffer for nothin ', pal .
you hear me?
'cause you're gonna fuckin 'talk .
i don't fucking know anything !
you fuckin 'know .
you know .
look at me .
you fuckin 'know .
what in the sam hill's goin 'on here?
nice guy , we got a cop .
where the fuck is joe?
holy shit .
orange is dead .
no , he's not dead , but he will be if we don't get him taken care of .
we were set up .
the cops were there waitin 'for us .
what?
nobody fuckin 'set anybody up .
the cops were there waitin 'for us .
bullshit .
fuck you , man !
you weren't there , we were , and the cops had that store staked out .
okay , mr. fuckin 'detective , you're so fuckin 'smart .
who did it?
we've been askin 'each other !
what'd you come up with?
you think i fuckin 'set you up?
i don't know , but somebody did .
nobody did .
you fuckin 'assholes turned the jewelry store
don't you call me an asshole !
you fuckin 'idiot !
turned the jewelry store into a wild west show ... and you wonder why the fuckin 'cops show up?
where's joseph?
i don't know .
i ain't talked to him .
i talked to dov .
he says daddy's comin 'down here and he's fuckin 'pissed .
he's pissed?
i told you he'd be pissed .
what'd joe say?
i told you , i ain't talked to him !
all i know is he's pissed .
what are you gonna do about him?
give me a fuckin 'chance to breathe .
i got a few questions of my own here .
you ain't dying .
he is .
all right , mr. fuckin 'compassion , i will call somebody !
who?
a fuckin 'snake charmer !
who do you think?
i'll call a doctor .
they'll fix him right up .
what happened to brown and blue?
brown's dead .
we don't know what happened to blue .
brown's dead?
are you sure?
i'm sure .
i was there .
he took one in the head .
nobody's got a clue what happened to mr. blue?
either he's alive or he's dead ... or the cops got him or they don't .
i take it this is the bastard you told me about .
why are you beatin 'on him?
maybe he could tell us who set us up .
you beat this prick long enough , he'll tell you he started the chicago fire .
now that don't necessarily make it fuckin 'so !
come on , man , think !
all right , first things fuckin 'last .
who's got the stones?
please , somebody tell me one little fuckin 'favor .
i got a bag .
okay?
i stashed it 'til we could be sure this place wasn't a police station .
good for you .
now let's go get it .
first we gotta get rid of those cars .
it looks like sam's hot car lot outside .
okay .
blondie , stay here and baby sit them two .
white and pink , take a car each .
i'll follow you .
you ditch 'em .
pick up the stones .
while i'm followin 'you , i'll arrange some sort of a doctor for our friend .
you can't leave these guys here with him .
why not?
because he's a fuckin 'psycho .
and if you think joe's pissed off ... that ain't nothin 'compared to how pissed off i am at him ... for puttin 'me in the same room as that bastard .
you see what i've been puttin 'up with , eddie?
i fuckin 'walked in here , i told these guys about stayin 'put .
mr. white whips out his gun , he's stickin 'it in my face ... callin 'me a motherfucker , sayin 'he's gonna blow me away ... and blah , blah , blah , blah , blah .
he's the reason the joint turned into a shootin 'spree .
what are you , a fuckin 'silent partner?
tell him !
he went crazy in the store , but he seems all right now .
this is what he was doin ': bam , bam ... bam , bam .
yeah , bam , bam , bam , bam , bam .
i told 'em not to touch the fuckin 'alarm , they did .
if they hadn't have done what i told 'em not to do , they'd still be alive .
my fuckin 'hero .
thanks .
that's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
i don't like alarms , mr. white .
what does it matter who stays with the cop?
we ain't lettin 'him go .
he's seen everybody .
i haven't been looking at you guys .
shut the fuck up , man !
you guys should never have taken him outta the trunk in the first place .
we tried to find out about the setup .
there is no fuckin 'setup !
now here's the news !
blondie , you stay here , take care of these two !
white and pink , you come with me , 'cause if joe gets here ... and he sees all these cars parked outside ...
i swear to you he's gonna be just as mad at me as he is at you .
fine .
let's go .
alone at last .
guess what .
i think i'm parked in the red zone .
now , where were we?
i told you , i don't know anything about any fuckin 'setup .
i've been on the force for only eight months .
they don't tell me anything .
nobody tells me shit .
you can torture me all you want .
torture you?
that's a good
that's a good idea .
i like that one , yeah .
even your boss said there wasn't a setup .
my what?
your boss .
excuse me , pal .
i don't have a boss .
nobody tells me what to do .
you understand?
you hear what i said , you son of a bitch?
all right , all right , all right , you don't have a boss .
get that fuckin 'shit off .
look , i'm not gonna bullshit you , okay?
i don't really give a good fuck what you know or don't know ... but i'm gonna torture you anyway ... regardless .
not to get information .
it's amusing to me ... to torture a cop .
you can say anything you want because i've heard it all before .
all you can do is ... pray for a quick death ... which ... you ain't gonna get .
oh , god .
you ever listen to k bllly's " super sounds of the '70s "?
it's my personal favorite .
joe egan and gerry rafferty were a duo known as stealer's wheel ... when they recorded this dylanesque , pop , bubble gum favorite ... from april of 1974 .
that reached up to number five ... as k bllly's " super sounds of the '70s " continues .
hold still .
hold still , you fuck .
was that good for you too?
hey , what's goin 'on?
you hear that?
don't go anywhere .
i'll be right back .
don't !

i don't know what to tell you , marvin .
that fuck .
that sick fuck !
that fuckin 'bastard !
marvin , i need you to hold on .
there's cops waiting to move a block away .
what the fuck are they waiting for?
this fuckin 'guy , he slashes my face ... and cuts my fuckin 'ear off !
i'm fuckin 'deformed !
fuck you !
i'm fuckin 'dyin 'here !
i'm fuckin 'dyin '!
they're not to make a move 'til joe cabot shows up .
i was sent in to get him .
all right?
you heard 'em .
they said he's on his way .
don't pussy out on me now , marvin .
we're just gonna sit here and bleed ...
'til joe cabot sticks his fuckin 'head through that door .
say hello to a motherfucker who's inside .
cabot's doing a job .
he wants me on the team .
this better not be a joke .
this ain't a joke .
i'm in .
i'm up his ass .
nice guy eddie tells me joe wants to meet me .
he says i should just wait for a phone call .
after waiting three days he calls me last night and says joe's ready .
he'll pick me up in 15 minutes .
who picked you up?
nice guy .
we get to a bar .
what bar?
smokey pete's in gardena .
we get there ... and i meet joe and a guy named mr. white .
phony name .
my name's mr. orange .
mr. orange?
mr. orange .
okay , mr. orange .
you ever see this motherfucker before?
who?
mr. white?
yes .
mr. white .
no .
he ain't one of cabot's men either .
he's gotta be from out of town .
joe knows him good .
how can you tell?
the way they talk .
you can tell they're buddies .
you two talk?
me and joe?
mr. white .
a little .
about what?
the brewers .
milwaukee brewers?
they won the night before .
he made some money off them .
good .
if this crook's a brewers fan , he's gotta be from wisconsin .
and i'll bet you everything ... they got a sheet in milwaukee on this mr. white's ass .
so i want you to go through everybody in milwaukee ... with a history of armed robbery and put a name to the face .
nice work , freddy .
thank you , my man .
how was long beach mike's referral?
perfect .
his backing me up went a long way .
i told them i played poker with him .
nice guy checked it out and said it was a okay .
said i was a good thief , i didn't rattle ... and that i was ready to move .
he's a good guy .
i wouldn't be inside without him .
long beach mike is not your friend .
long beach mike is a fucking scumbag .
he's selling out his friends .
that's how nice he fuckin 'is .
i'll take care of his ass ... but you get that scumbag out of mind and take care of business .
gone .
use the commode story?
what's the commode story?
it's a scene .
memorize it .
a what?
undercover cops gotta be brando .
to do this job you gotta be a great actor , naturalistic .
you gotta be naturalistic as hell .
if you're a bad actor , that's bullshit in this job .
what is this?
that's an amusing anecdote about a drug deal .
something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job .
i gotta memorize all this?
there's four pages of this shit .
think about it like it's a joke .
memorize what's important .
the rest you make your own .
you can tell a joke , can't you?
well , pretend you're don rickles ... and tell a joke , all right?
the things you gotta remember are the details .
the details sell your story .
this particular story takes place in a men's room .
you gotta know all the details whether they got paper towels or a blower to dry your hands .
you gotta know if the stalls ain't got no doors or not .
you gotta know if they got liquid soap or that pink , granulated shit ... they used in high school .
you gotta know if they got hot water or not , if it stinks ... if some nasty , lowlife , scum ridden motherfucker ... sprayed diarrhea all over one of the bowls .
you gotta know every detail there is to know about this commode .
what you gotta do is take all them details and make 'em your own .
while you're doing that , remember that this story is about you ... and how you perceived the events that went down .
the only way to do that ... is keep sayin 'it ... and sayin 'it and sayin 'it .
this is during the l. a. marijuana drought , 1986 .
i still had a connection , which was insane 'cause ... you couldn't get any weed anywhere then .
anyway , i had a connection with this hippie chick in santa cruz ... and all my friends knew it .
they call me and say , " hey , freddy
i say , " hey , dude .
you gettin 'some?
can you get some for me too?
they knew i still smoked , so they asked me to buy some for them .
it got to be
every time i bought some weed i was buyin 'for four or five people .
finally i said , fuck this shit .
i'm makin 'this bitch rich .
she didn't even have to meet these people .
i was doing all the work .
that got to be a pain in the ass , people calling all the time .
i couldn't even rent a tape without six fuckin 'interruptions .
when's the next time you're gettin 'some?
motherfucker , i'm tryin 'to watch the lost boys .
when i get some , i'll call you .
then these rink a dink potheads come by .
they're my friends and everything , but still
i got it laid out in 60 dollar bags , they don't want 60 dollars worth .
they want ten dollars 'worth , and breaking it up wasn't easy .
i don't even know what ten dollars 'worth looks like .
this was a very weird situation .
remember back in '86 ... there was a major fuckin 'drought .
nobody had anything .
people were livin 'on resin , smokin 'the wood in their pipes .
this chick had a bunch and she's beggin 'me to sell it .
so i told her i wasn't gonna be joe the pot man anymore ... but i would take a little bit and sell it to my close friends .
she agreed and we kept the same arrangement as before ten percent and free pot for me ... if i helped her that weekend .
she was sellin 'a brick of weed and didn't wanna go to the buy alone .
her brother usually goes with her , but he's in county unexpectedly .
what for?
his traffic tickets gone to warrant .
they stopped him , found warrants on him , took him to county .
she doesn't wanna walk around alone with all that weed .
i don't wanna do this .
i have a very bad feeling about it .
she keeps asking me , asking me .
finally i said okay 'cause i'm sick of hearing it .
so we go to the train station  wait .
you're goin 'to the train station with the weed on ya?
the guy needed it right away .
anyway , we get to the train station ... and we're waitin 'for the guy .
i'm carryin 'the weed in a carry on bag .
i gotta take a piss , so i tell her i'm goin 'to the boy's room .
so i walk into the men's room and who's standing there?
four los angeles county sheriffs and a german shepherd .
they're waitin 'for you?
no , they're just talkin '.
when i walked in , they all stopped talkin '... and they looked at me .
that's hard .
that's a fuckin 'hard situation .
german shepherd starts barking .
he's barkin 'at me .
i mean , it's obvious he's barkin 'at me .
take off , man .
just bail .
get the fuck outta there .
panic hits me like a bucket of water .
bam !
right in the face .
i'm drenched in panic and these cops are lookin 'at me and they know it .
they can smell it , sure as that fuckin 'dog can .
they can smell it on me .
shut up .
so anyway , i got my gun drawn .
i point it at this guy and i tell him ...
freeze .
don't fuckin 'move .
this little idiot's looking right at me and saying ...
i know , i know .
but meanwhile his right hand is creepin 'toward the glove box .
i scream at him , " asshole !
i'm gonna blow you away right now !
put your hands on the dash .
he's still looking at me , nodding his head .
i know , buddy , i know .
meanwhile his hand is still going for the glove box .
and i said ...
buddy , i'm gonna shoot you in the face ... if you don't put your hands up .
chuck , what are you doin '?
listen to the officer !
put your hands on the dash !
so then the guy snaps out of it and puts his hands on the dash .
what was he goin 'for?
his fucking registration .
you're kidding .
no , man !
stupid citizen doesn't know how close he came to gettin 'blown away .
that close , man .
you knew how to handle that situation .
you shit your pants , dive in and swim .
tell me more about cabot .
i don't know .
he's a cool guy .
he's funny .
he's a funny guy .
you remember the fantastic four?
yeah , with that invisible bitch ... and " flame on " and shit , right?
thing .
motherfucker ...
iooks just like the thing .
hey !
showtime !
grab your jacket .
i'm parked outside .
i'll be right down .
he'll be right down .
don't pussy out on me now .
they don't know .
they don't know shit .
you're not gonna get hurt .
you're fuckin 'baretta .
they believe every fuckin 'word 'cause you're super cool .
there goes our boy .
the guy has to have rocks in his head the size of gibraltar ... to work undercover .
you want one of these?
yeah , give me the bear claw .
i know what i'm talking about .
black women ain't the same as white women .
there's a slight difference .
very funny .
you know what i mean .
what a white bitch will put up with , a black bitch wouldn't for a minute .
if you cross their line , they fuck you up .
i gotta go along with pink on that .
okay , mr. expert , if this is such a truism ... why is it that every nigger i know treats his woman like a piece of shit?
i'll bet those same niggers who show their ass in public ... when their bitches get 'em home they chill the fuck out .
not these guys .
oh , yeah .
those guys too .
tell you guys a story .
in one of daddy's clubs there's a black cocktail waitress named elois .
elois?
yeah , elois .
e and lois .
we called her lady e.
where was she from?
compton?

ladora heights .
the black beverly hills .
it's not the black beverly hills .
it's the black palos verdes .
anyway ...
lady e , she was a man eater upper .
un fuckin 'believable .
every guy who ever saw her had to jack off to her at least once .
you know who she looked like?
christie love .
remember that tv show get christie love ... about the black female cop?
she always used to say , " you're under arrest , sugar !
who played christie love?
pam grier .
no , it wasn't pam grier .
pam grier was the other one .
pam grier did the film .
christie love was like a pam grier tv show without pam grier .
so , who was christie love?
how should i know?
great .
now i'm totally fuckin 'tortured .
whoever it was , she looked exactly like elois .
anne francis .
no .
that was honey west .
anne francis is white .
i'm tryin 'to tell a story here .
she looked exactly like elois .
we come into the club one night ... and there's carlos , the bartender .
he's a wetback .
he's a friend of mine .
i says to him , " carlos , where's lady e tonight?
apparently lady e ... was married to real piece of dog shit , a real animal .
he used to do things to her .
like what?
what would he do?
beat her up?
i don't know .
he just did things .
so anyway , one night she plays it real cool .
she waits for him to get drunk .
he falls asleep on the fuckin 'couch .
she sneaks up on him , puts some glue on his dick ... and glues his dick to his belly .
jesus christ !
i'm serious , man .
i'm dead serious .
they had to call the paramedics to cut the prick loose .
was he all pissed off?
how would you feel if you had to do a fuckin 'handstand to take a piss?
you guys like to tell jokes and giggle and kid around , huh?
giggling like a bunch of girls in the schoolyard .
well , let me tell a joke .
five guys sittin 'in a bullpen ...
san quentin ... wonderin 'how the fuck they got there .
what did we do wrong?
what shouldn't we have done?
it's your fault , his fault
all that bullshit .
finally somebody says ...
wait a minute .
while we were planning this caper ... we just sat around tellin 'fuckin 'jokes .
got the message?
i don't mean to holler at ya .
when this caper's over , and i'm sure it'll be successful ... we'll go down to hawaiian lslands , i'll laugh with all of youse .
find me a different character down there .
right now it's a matter of business .
with the exception of eddie and myself ... who you already know ... we're gonna be using aliases on this job .
under no circumstances ... do we want any one of you to relate to each other ... by your christian names .
and i don't want any talk about yourself personally .
that includes where you been , your wife's name ... where you might've done time ... or a bank maybe you robbed in st. petersburg .
all i want you guys to talk about , if you have to ... is what you're gonna do .
that should do it .
these are your names
mr. brown , mr. white ...
mr. blonde , mr. blue ...
mr. orange and mr. pink .
why am i mr. pink?
because you're a faggot !
all right?
why can't we pick our own colors?
no way .
no way .
tried it once .
it doesn't work .
you get four guys all fightin 'over who gets to be mr. black .
they don't know each other , so nobody wants to back down .
no way .
i pick .
you're mr. pink .
be thankful you're not mr. yellow .
but mr. brown , that's too close to mr. shit .
mr. pink sounds like mr. pussy .
how about mr. purple?
that's sounds good .
i'll be mr. purple .
you're not mr. purple .
some guy on some other job is mr. purple .
you're mr. pink !
who cares what your name is?
easy for you to say .
you're mr. white .
you have a cool sounding name .
if it's no big deal to be mr. pink , you wanna trade?
nobody's tradin 'with anybody .
this ain't a goddamn fuckin 'city council meeting , you know .
now listen up , mr. pink .
there's two ways you can go on this job my way or the highway .
what's it gonna be , mr. pink?
jesus christ , joe .
fuckin 'forget about it .
it's beneath me .
i'm mr. pink .
let's move on .
i'll move on when i feel like it .
do all you guys got the goddamn message?
i'm so goddamn mad hollerin 'at you guys , i can hardly talk .
let's go to work .
let's go over it .
where are you?
i stand outside and guard the door .
i don't let anybody go in or out .
mr. brown .
he waits in the car .
i give him the signal , he pulls up in front .
mr. blonde and mr. blue .
crowd control .
they handle the customers and the employees .
that girl's ass .
sittin 'right here on my dick .
myself and mr. pink?
you two take the manager and make him give you the diamonds .
we're there for those stones , period .
since no display cases are being fucked with , no alarms should go off .
we're out in two minutes , not one second longer .
what if the manager won't give you the diamonds?
a store like this is insured up the ass .
they're not supposed to give you any resistance whatsoever .
if you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's charles bronson ... smash their nose with your gun .
drops him right to the floor .
everyone jumps .
he falls down screaming , blood squirts out of his nose .
freaks everybody out .
nobody says fuckin 'shit after that .
some bitch might talk shit to you .
give her a look like she's next .
watch her shut the fuck up .
if it's the manager , that's different .
the managers know not to fuck around ... so if he's giving you static ... he probably thinks he's a real cowboy so you gotta that bastard in two .
if he won't tell ya something , cut off one of his fingers .
the little one .
then tell him his thumb's next .
after that he'll tell you if he wears ladies underwear .
i'm hungry .
let's get a taco .
fuck .
jesus .
i'm blind , man .
i'm fuckin 'blind .
no , you just got blood in your eyes .
is he dead?
did he die or not?
let's go .
hold it !
get out !
get out of the fuckin 'car !
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry , larry .
i can't believe she killed me .
who'd have fucking thought that?
hey , just cancel that shit right now .
you're hurt .
you're hurt real fuckin 'bad .
but you ain't dying .
all this blood's scaring the shit out of me , larry .
i'm gonna die .
i know it .
what the fuck happened?
he slashed the cop's face , cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive .
what?
i didn't hear you .
i said ...
blonde went crazy .
he slashed the cop's face , cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive .
this cop?
he went crazy?
something like that?
worse or better?
eddie , he was pulling a burn , man .
he was gonna kill the cop and me .
when you guys walked in , he was gonna kill you and run with the diamonds .
what'd i tell ya?
that sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho .
you should've asked the cop , not just killed him .
he talked about what he was gonna do when he was slicing him up .
i don't buy it .
doesn't make sense .
makes perfect fuckin 'sense to me .
you didn't see how he acted during the job .
we did .
he's right .
the ear's hacked off .
let me just say this out loud , 'cause i wanna get this straight .
you're saying that mr. blonde ... was gonna kill you ... and then when we got back he was gonna kill us ... take the diamonds and scram .
i'm right about that , right?
that's your story?
i swear on my mother's soul ... that's what happened .
the man you killed just got released from prison .
he got caught at a company warehouse full of hot items .
he could've fuckin 'walked .
all he had to do was say my dad's name , but he didn't ; he kept his mouth shut .
he did his fuckin 'time like a man .
he did four years for us .
so , mr. orange ... you're telling me that this good friend of mine ... who did four years for my father ... who , in four years , never made a deal , no matter what they offered him ... you're telling me that now that he's free ... and we're making good on our commitment to him ... he's just gonna decide , out of the fucking blue ... to rip us off?
why don't you tell me what really happened .
what the hell for?
it'd just be more bullshit .
this man set us up .
dad , i'm sorry , but i don't know what's happening .
it's all right .
i do .
what are you talking about?
that lump of shit's workin 'with the l. a. p. d.
i don't have the slightest fucking idea ... what you're talking about .
joe , i don't know what you think you know , but you're wrong .
like hell i am .
trust me on this .
you've made a mistake .
he's a good kid .
i understand you're super fuckin 'pissed .
we're all real emotional .
but you're barking up the wrong tree .
i know him .
he wouldn't do that .
you don't know jack shit !
i do .
the cocksucker tipped off the cops ... and got mr. brown and mr. blue killed .
mr. blue is dead?
dead as dillinger .
how do you know all this?
he was the only one i wasn't 100 percent on .
i should have my head examined , going ahead when i wasn't 100 percent .
that's your proof?
with instinct , you don't need proof .
i ignored it before , but no more .
have you lost your fuckin 'mind?
i'm not gonna let you make a terrible mistake .
come on , guys .
nobody wants this .
we're supposed to be fuckin 'professionals .
larry , look ... it's been quite a long time .
a lot of jobs .
there's no need for this , man .
let's just put our guns down ... and let's settle this ... with a fucking conversation .
joe , if you kill that man , you die next .
repeat : you kill him , you die next .
larry , we have been friends .
you respect my dad and i respect you ... but i'll put bullets in you .
you put that fuckin 'gun down now .
goddamn you , joe ... don't make me do this .
larry , you stop pointin 'that gun at my dad !
i'm sorry , kid .
looks like we're gonna ... do a little time .
i'm a cop .
larry ...
i'm sorry .
i'm ... so sorry .
i'm a cop .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
i'm ... sorr
freeze !
drop the fucking gun , buddy !
now !
put the gun down !
don't do it !
drop the gun , man !
drop the fucking gun !
we're gonna blow you away !
