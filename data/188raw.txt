no !
morons !
messed up my hair .
k o !
too short !
ls it?
are we best friends?
why else would i ask you here?
then i can be honest .
i have a bad feeling about this .
daddy will stop the wedding?
how would he find out?
why does daddy dislike him?
but i'm marrying him anyway .
forget about your father .
where's your groom?
we spoke on the phone three nights ago .
he asked if i liked his gift .
he has to fix up our new home in hong kong .
before a big event like this .
you haven't called him in days?
but i did .
i only reached his voicemail .
voicemail?
relax , he set the wedding up .
maybe his fight is late .
macy , i checked with the airline .
his flight arrived 4 hours ago .
maybe he took another flight .
i've checked with all airlines .
maybe he got sick of flying .
the chapel can't wait any more .
so?
cancel it then .
thank you .
hello !
what?
wedding?
today?
no !
who are you?
who let you in?
i did , i installed your look .
i was your interior designer .
you're yung , the decorator man .
your work is done , why are you here?
good question .
what do you want?
hold it !
answer me .
where's your husband?
i'm not married .

where is he?
why should i tell you?
you're trespassing ,
i'll call the cops .
go ahead .
let's see who's the crook .
i received my final payment cheque . $2, 837, 695
your beau signed it .
that's weird .
it bounced like mad .
so?
time to pay up .
no more tricks .
maybe you're conning me .
you two make a great couple .
one vanished , the other ...
leave me alone .
air ticket !
honeymoon?
but you won't pay up .
so irresponsible !
what?
you're so damn selfish .
lucky you're not a man .
or?
with one punch i'll knock you down .
then a kick to send you flying .
lf you fight so well .
be a hitman , not a decorator .
none of your business .
please give me back my cheque .
a gentleman like me .
never argues with mean women .
thank you .
we're together .
sure .
your passports and boarding passes .
you may board now .
thank you .
we're not together .
she's joking .
give them back .
why are you following me?
going to japan to find your husband?
swindlers !
what do you want?
to get paid .
out of order .
bad luck never comes alone .
the lift is not working .
let me .
this is so heavy .
you're moving here?
lf so , one suitcase won't do .
green doesn't suit you .
you like green?
a handle !
now that's much better .
well ...
why don't you shut up?
not a bad idea .
that's it .
takahashi yuji .
finally .
no violence please !
don't worry .
come out and pay me !
ls this the right place?
it's empty .
has he moved?
he's your husband .
you should know .
i don't .
he didn't come to our wedding .
sorry !
takahashi?
do you know them?
i don't !
get them !
what did he say?
get us " !
tell them they're mistaken .
you got it wrong .
are you after him?
didn't you tell them to stop?
i did !
so stop it !
you did not .
did too .
after them !
thank you .
you're welcome , macy .
you know me?
did takahashi send you?
where is he?
you'll find out .
you know her?
good thing she showed up .
those men know kung fu .
and they're good .
thank her for me .
he's very annoying .
done !
really?
she said , " shut up " .
she didn't even move her lips .
i'll talk to her .
you're beautiful .
shut up !
sit tight , here they come .
closed .
welcome ...
come with me .
macy , welcome to tokyo .
watch those men for me .
yes , sir .
we'll talk upstairs .
please sit !
all of you can speak chinese .
who are you?
they learned because they fancy the boss .
so did you .
go now !
yes , sir !
i'm lin , i'm chinese .
that's arisa and sayuri !
naomi rescued you earlier .
they're my assistants .
all japanese .
so is lady owner here .
we're the good guys .
this is my name card .
you're a private detective?
listen up !
your attackers work for kobe gang leader lto .
their motive involves your fiance takahashi .
you are in great danger .
must we believe you?
that's up to you .
they were going to hong kong .
to look for macy .
mister .
how do you know so much?
i also know you fight well .
really?
why do they want me?
why are you spying on us?
both questions have the same answer .
to find takahashi through you .
ls he in trouble?
lady owner .
yes .
the story began two weeks ago .
game over .
it's my turn now .
i get 5 more tries .
stop that !
answer the door .
it's business , hurry !
what a cheat !
hurry !
what's the big rush?
wait ...
do you know who i am?
i can't see .
boss of the kobe gang , japan's biggest .
lto takeshi .
mr. lto to you .
whatever .
a private eye who speaks bad japanese .
but i like him .
what one needs is brains .
exactly why i'm here .
check this woman up .
it's top secret .
why would a gang leader ask for my help?
but it made perfect sense .
his woman was unfaithful .
how embarrassing if his men knew .
using a chinese who speaks bad japanese .
even if word got out .
no one would believe me .
there .
takahashi !
i missed you .
get these developed now .
yes !
may i see your work today?
sure !
i soon found out .
takahashi heads a u. s. investment firm .
commuting around asia .
many japanese gang bosses are his clients .
lncluding lto and miyuki .
great work .
let's have fun tonight .
thank you .
i'm a private eye .
i'm very flexible .
and greedy too .
life's too short .
first time here?
hi !
may i present ...
chinatown's best private eye .
and my partner .
lndulge him .
he's handsome .
cute too !
it was weird .
he told people i was his buddy .
and his partner .
two days later .
lto came .
i planned to sell the photos again .
why are you so late?
my woman eloped with takahashi .
you saw him last .
i hear you're his buddy .
where did they go?
i don't know .
you don't?
you don't? !
miyamoto .
i finally found out .
lto loves his wife miyuki dearly .
she managed finance for the gang .
so she knows everything .
she eloped with a lot of money .
and something important to the gang .
i haven't found out what it is .
they're gone , and i'm in trouble .
everyone is looking for them .
and their pals .
we're in trouble until takahashi shows up .
so call the police .
who are you?
yung , an interior designer .
no wonder you're naive .
i called the police long ago .
but it's no major crime .
they did zip .
what's your plan then?
macy , find takahashi for you .
why should i believe you?
you decide .
that's horrible .
such poor taste .
macy's far better .
lucky you didn't marry him .
you're out of line .
i'm comforting her .
shut up !
let's find you a safe place to rest .
takahashi , japanese .
raised in usa .
i know all this .
what does his company do?
i don't know .
i met him in tokyo .
he's very secretive .
what about family and friends?
he has few friends .
and no family here .
he earned everything by himself .
he mentioned any problems lately?
a capable man like him .
can take care of his problems .
come off this adoration .
what do you talk about?
that's none of your business .
but he is never rude .
you know so little of him .
how can you marry him?
none of your business .
so you don't know he deals with gangs .
much less his affair with miyuki .
of course not .
perhaps his taste changed .
all right .
i'm after his money .
you like that answer?
i'll go home tomorrow .
and forget about him .
sorry , i can't help you .
big mouth .
i'm trying to help you .
your words stink .
and yours hurt .
sir ... yes , sir ...
i'll settle my debt .
yes , i know .
i will pay you back , honest .
i was conned .
no lies .
don't shout at me .
that girl is helpless too .
good morning .
you've changed .
found your suitcase?
i'm fine now .
i bought these this morning .
nice?
yes !
i'll buy you breakfast .
delicious?
yes .
are you feeding your grief?
you should go to the airport now .
i'll take a later flight .
i can't leave you alone .
i've already decided .
don't worry !
i'm fine .
it's your life .
why should i be worried?
here !
for the bill?
it's for you .
for me?
the code is 332335 .
i have about $200, 000 in my account .
what's this?
are you paying for takahashi?
you're an innocent victim .
take it as partial payment .
i don't have the rest .
i'll call you if i find him .
332335 .
that's 33 , 23 , 35 .
nice figure .
you are truly annoying .
the hips need work .
anyway , thanks .
you have yens?
yes !
narita airport !
yes !
i've sent him away .
now what?
okay !
can't fool me !
mr. akagawa has been waiting .
thanks .
can i help you?
just looking around .
now visitors .
please leave .
macy , my dear .
hi !
you may go home
have a seat .
takahashi said you can help me .
what happened to him?
i don't know .
he missed his own wedding .
i'm so worried .
think !
did he leave anything special ... in your care recently?
thank you .
goodbye !
nothing special .
think carefully .
a key to a safe?
a disk , or a notebook?
hey , you .
please leave .
okay , sorry .
please leave !
okay .
bye .
nothing !
you want some coffee?
sure !
what are you doing?
tired?
answer my questions now , understand?
yes !
you drugged her .
who are you?
come !
7th floor .
they both went up .
akagawa lnc .
you're good .
hang in there .
yes , sir !
i'm mr. akagawa's friend .
piece of cake .
save climbing stairs .
over here .
you know me?
get in !
you rescued macy?
when?
you were too busy fighting .
you didn't see me .
why didn't you help me?
you didn't need help .
you had the easy job .
i'm the hero .
the hero always saves the beauty .
right !
the crook gave her something to drink .
are you macy?
yes !
why are you looking for takahashi?
he promised to marry me .
she sound like she's been hypnotized .
she must have taken ttttt .
what's that?
till ... they tell the truth .
a drug?
yes !
till they tell the truth is cla's .
it's a hypnotic drug .
it neutralizes your will power .
very effective on normal people .
but for trained spies .
or those with strong will power .
it's useless .
did takahashi give you anything?
yes , many things .
wedding gown designs .
weight loss menus ...
she's babbling ...
and sweating .
wedding ring .
she won't know where ... he stashes things .
it wouldn't be banks .
does he have any lockers?
yes , at a club .
name?
i don't know .
address?
i forgot .
that's no help .
i can go .
how?
i remember the way .
then you can lead us there .
macy , wake up !
stop manhandling her .
she won't talk after the drug wears off .
are you after takahashi's money?
or his girlfriend?
don't you want the truth?
of course i do .
but she's in pain .
you're too nice .
now she's fainted .
i can't stand you .
i want to beat you up .
really?
using your spinning kicks?
no , fists will do .
you're dead meat .
i am?
i'll smash your face .
let's find a place .
shut up .
fine .
how did i get here?
you can't remember anything?
akagawa gave me some coffee .
then asked many questions .
macy !
let go .
she's so ungrateful .
akagawa drugged you .
we didn't .
we saved you .
whatever takahashi has on the gang .
i thought he might have given it to you .
so he can bargain if they catch him .
not the things you mentioned though .
maybe it's in his club looker .
macy , wise up .
enough mystery cracking .
it's getting dangerous .
we'll return to hong kong .
think you'll be safe there?
that thing is important to akagawa and lto .
they'll find macy in hong kong .
let her decide .
the club .
we'll go tomorrow .
macy !
macy's gone !
i checked on her every 10 minutes .
you were showering .
you sure took your time .
she's waiting for us at the bar .
hurry .
you've had enough .
no problem .
3 more , please .
yes , miss .
she's drunk .
how come?
she's heartbroken .
come drink with me .
go , drink with her .
aren't you crazy about her?
that's enough .
drink .
no .
she's classy .
beautiful and nice .
you fancy her .
no , just stating facts .
men are disposable .
like this can of grass .
don't be silly .
yes , don't be sad .
he's not worth it .
you've lost a man , that's all .
i know , i've lost a man .
but not only that .
i've lost my self respect , but ...
i've gained one thing .
a promise that can't be fulfilled .
it's not fair?
it's not ...
i turned against my dad .
went to marry him .
you think i went his money?
i really love him .
was i drunk last night?
we should turn right .
how would you know?
trust me !
did i embarrass myself?
take a right turn .
cut it out .
only macy knows .
left or right , macy?
left !
i told you !
left's what i meant .
you moron .
it's upstairs .
you overacted .
what?
it became phony .
i tried .
not good enough .
welcome .
this way , please .
welcome ...
member's name?
takahashi yuji .
pass code please .
this way .
he uses this code a lot .
saori , check club a for me .
yes , sir .
takahashi brought me here twice .
wait , on second , thought .
lf the thing is here .
our fate may worsen .
you leave then .
but everyone knows we're together .
it's empty .
the club is owned by lto .
let's go !
why?
welcome to my club .
i am lto .
these two have met my men .
who are you?
you opened the looker .
so you know much about takahashi .
i can't let any of you leave .
i'll see senator aoshima off .
capture them .
run !
sorry !
my purse and passport .
get the car !
what did he say?
i couldn't hear him .
let's pick him up ahead .
wait for me !
he's ahead .
sit tight .
jump !
what are you doing?
payback time !
you look so handsome when you're holding a gun .
let me see your gun .
this one?
yes !
no way !
why not?
what's that for?
guns are scarce in japan .
you've got one .
who are you?
stop it .
it may backfire .
you said lto hired you .
but be didn't recognize you .
you made things up .
the photos are fake?
i can't tell you .
then get out .
believe me , you can't handle this .
he's a liar .
get out .
lin !
everything ... you said is false?
the photos are real !
so is takahashi's elopement .
get out ...
let's quit investigating .
we should return to hong kong .
we've go friends there .
i'm staying .
takahashi's missing .
i'm going to the cops .
didn't he tell you?
it's useless .
the cops will do nothing .
lin's a liar .
take me to the cops .
please !
okay !
look over there .
$6, 920 , thank you .
and a telephone card .
boss , it's me .
i've done what you asked .
now?
near the airport .
i'll get her back .
safely to hong kong .
call you later .
you're alone?
are you lost?
where is macy?
you know me?
come with me anyway .
you fight well .
but i'm not coming .
really?
mr. yung .
my boss knew you'd go to the airport .
this is the only route .
lin again .
well done .
thank you .
how's he doing?
ask him .
you okay?
great figures .
porn movie actresses?
easy !
don't be so mean .
shut up !
are you japanese?
shut up !
you're no private eye .
who are you?
find out yourself .
private eye yung .
yung , hong konger , age 29 .
fascinated with martial arts .
attended the academy of martial arts at 17 .
champion 4 years in a row .
wrong file?
no !
turned private eye and bodyguard .
back in 1994 .
you're good .
of course !
we're not done yet .
3 months ago ,
tai lee bank's chairman hired you .
to pose as an interior designer .
to research takahashi's motive for pursuing ... his daughter macy .
but you found nothing .
then ran into this mess .
now you lost macy .
ls she correct?
how did you find out?
my assistants are good .
they bribed ... your employees .
saori , find macy .
yes , sir !
lmpressive !
i've researched you .
you're not private eye .
you came to japan at 12 .
were educated here .
the rest is classified .
how strange .
are you an undercover cop?
why should i tell you?
that's true .
we are friends now .
i don't want to see you helpless .
this thing's too complicated .
you're out of your league .
go back to hong kong .
i'll find macy .
i was going to the airport .
we shouldn't have brought you back .
exactly .
we screwed up .
we'll take you to the airport .
no tricks now .
relax .
i've had enough .
but please tell me who you are .
don't be nosy .
thanks .
it's good to be free .
i've had it with you !
i'll beat you up !
be my guest !
come on !
you tricked me .
i'll shock you too .
don't use it .
fine , i'll use something else .
my fist .
i'll break you nose , then poke your eyes .
you talk too much .
i'll break your throat .
i'll talk .
spare my face .
such vanity .
get up .
thanks !
i'm half japanese , a defense ministry staff .
lnternal affairs ,
external division .
want it in english?
yes .
i'm a spy .
no wonder it's classified .
your ld?
right here , take a good look .
a real spy .
what do you want to know?
here's the first question .
who is takahashi?
akagawa drugged macy .
he and takahashi are cla agents .
their investment firm is a front .
they used lto and his gang .
to circulate counterfeit yens .
to devalue the yen .
the cla sent takahashi to marry macy .
to get to her dad .
but he fell for lto's woman .
he kept evidence on cla's dealings ... with the gang and the senate as protection .
ln case lto found out about him and miyuki .
ten days ago , lto discovered the affair . so they eloped with the evidence .
the cla and the gang couldn't find them .
their only clue was macy .
last night , the cla transferred akagawa out .
now you know .
macy's in great danger .
exactly .
then i can't leave .
let me help you .
how can i refuse?
you might beat me up .
she needs help .
yes?
come over .
you too , suzuki .
sorry , please wait .
senator aoshima reported an assault , by 2 men and a woman , at club a today .
their graphic impressions .
are being faxed over .
yes , sir !
miss , you want a job?
posing for a video .
no .
but it pays well .
hold it !
left her coat .
may i borrow 10 yen?
bye , lady .
this is macy .
i lost everything .
send someone for me .
what do you want?
my bodyguard is coming .
he's very tough .
and big .
a savage man .
hairy !
like ... a gorilla .
he'll beat you up .
you'd better go .
my dear macy .
it's you who sent for me .
i did not .
you called your dad .
he sent me .
i am that hairy bodyguard of yours .
he's the private eye your dad hired .
i don't believe you .
now what?
shut up , or i'll kill you .
quiet !
help !
i'll strip you naked .
quiet !
help !
i'll beat you up .
quiet !
or i'll ... ruin your face .
that worked .
like it worked on you .
welcome .
i'm going home .
you should .
you don't know anything .
hope they won't follow you .
to hong kong .
relax .
i'll be her bodyguard .
thanks , gorilla .
your lips are greasy .
they're fine .
where did you get these?
they give them away .
here , take a pack .
saori !
i brought our luggage .
put on your coat .
thanks !
you're welcome .
run !
freeze !
freeze or i'll shoot !
how did you find us?
you took the tissues .
before entering the noodle shop .
we control the tissue givers ... in this area .
it's all your fault .
why?
hie men give out the tissues .
where's takahashi?
spit it out .
or you will die .
don't kill me .
i can lead you to takahashi .
i agreed to be his smoke screen .
what's she saying?
she's takahashi's smoke screen .
to distract the cla and lto .
we're meeting 3 pm tomorrow .
they'll meet at the rainbow club .
she conned us .
vice versa .
that's true .
i've given up on him .
i can lure him out for you .
miyamoto .
yes !
take her and hide her .
kill the other two .
yes !
they'll kill you once they get him .
shut up !
say your prayers .
police !
you called?
earlier !
to escort you to the airport .
are you all right?
what took you so long?
we came as soon as you called .
what now?
come !
what for?
should we come?
no !
take a look !
takahashi?
you've got him?
why monkeyed around with us?
it's a long story .
8 days ago , his car crashed in hokkaido .
he went into a coma .
miyuki died .
local police traced his fingerprints .
discovered he's wanted by us .
my boss and i went to hokkaido to take over .
it's macy .
i've called many times .
i'm in vegas .
two more days ... to our wedding .
bye .
i'm coming over to japan .
takahashi's fiancee is chinese .
get near her , see if takahashi ...
left the evidence with her .
yes , sir !
he woke up yesterday .
we flew him here .
but he'd say nothing .
the cla found out .
either we turn him in within 24 hours .
or it becomes a diplomatic conflict .
so macy was innocent .
she was stalling .
we revealed our identities .
she knew we could save her .
use that ttttt on him .
he's trained cla agent .
it won't work .
why didn't you tell us?
we wanted you to leave .
it's getting dangerous for you two .
what's next?
i have a plan .
tell me .
where are you taking me?
american embassy .
wise up .
the cla will punish you .
you hand us the evidence .
we'll protect you for life .
no , thanks .
you're so cool !
and so stupid !
get out .
the embassy people?
lnside !
uncuff yourself !
you did come .
run , lto's here .
i'll kill you now .
you'll disappear with the evidence .
i've left copies with friends .
lf i don't call every 10 days .
they'll send their copies to the media .
and the japanese police .
you'd better wish me a long life .
macy's in danger .
but this may incriminate them .
drop your guns !
help me leave .
we'll bargain later .
that's a deal .
our wedding ...
you couldn't come , or didn't want to?
i couldn't .
action !
grab me !
thanks !
go !
come !
for out sake , destroy those copies .
i won't
they guarantee my safety .
they stay .
where's miyuki?
killed in car crash .
the crash kept you from our wedding?
sorry !
all boats , stop now !
don't shoot !
they're my friends .
send the speedboats !
speed up !
we're in the same boat .
lf we escape , the copies are yours .
jump off , i'll save you .
hurry !
i can't swim .
not there !
over here !
okay !
macy !
that's for miyuki .
we're in the river .
targets ahead .
mr. lto !
jump over !
thank you !
this is especially for you .
looks great .
without evidence , we couldn't nail them all .
don't spoil this farewell party ... for macy and yung .
you tried your best .
made two new friends .
so cheer up .
yes , smile .
smile ...
i can arrange for you to visit takahashi .
no need .
really?
he's gone from my mind .
no way .
try ttttt on her .
booze will do fine .
i'm serious .
i can even give up this wedding ring .
really?
i'll throw it away now .
you mean it?
do it !
or i'll do it for you .
let me !
be ruthless !
done !
i did it !
the chip was inside !
and it contains the evidence?
right you are .
special news report .
the police have charged gang boss lto , and businessman takahashi .
with dealing in counterfeit yens ,
3 senators were also involved ...
i'm off to the caribbean .
i'm still your bodyguard .
you're in our protection program .
you're safe with yung .
