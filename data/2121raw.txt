lisa !
you impregnated my sister again .
bitch !
i thought you wanted me to?
i said " don't " !
the kid could have been born before he'd notice .
you're not pregnant .
i feel " congratulations " is more appropriate .
you told her before you told me .
she's a witch !
she took one look at me and guessed .
say something !
bummer .
something else !
so ... she's six weeks pregnant .
that means the baby's due in april , may , ... .. june .
gemini .
that's cool .
einstein was a gemini .
so's that scottish gal from garbage .
will you go help jake with his pyjamas?
if she's late ...
lisa , i swear to god , ... .. start with the dionne warwick stuff , i'll throw you out the fuckin 'window .
so please help him with the pyjamas .
love you , too , tom

i mean it .
it's about time we had another kid .
i was gonna bring it up myself .

absolutely !
this time , you gotta take some time off .
please !
we can't afford that !
we can .
i'm gonna hit the overtime again .
i don't want you to work those hours again .
you come home in a trance .
you're completely useless to me .
i'm gonna be fine , ok?
i'm just gonna tell teddy to get somebody else for the thing .
oh , god !
oh , tom !
what?
i'm sorry .
i completely forgot .
no wonder you're pissed off .
i'm not pissed off .
i just ...
no , i'm ...
i'm not .
i'm not .
i'm a grown man .
i shouldn't be screwing around with some shitty band anyway .
hey , look , l i ...
i gotta go change .
you know , put on something cool .
i love you .
i'm ...
i'm a happy guy .
you know , i'm not gonna be a lineman forever , i promise you that .
whaddaya mean?
i clip ... clip wire all day .
a monkey could do it .
yeah , but they're gonna move you into the office soon .
no , i meant , when we first got together , i said a lotta stuff about what i was gonna be , ... .. and i just wanted you to know that , uh ...
i wasn't giving you some kinda line , ... .. that i meant it .
i didn't marry you because i thought you were gonna be famous .
i just liked the way your ass looked in jeans .
i never wanted to be famous .
i just , uh ...
i didn't expect to be ... so ...
what?
i don't know .
ordinary .
shhh .
hang on !
hang on !
you know , i hope it's a girl .
i'm kinda sick of all these balls around the house .
except for yours , babe .
what are the odds on an educated single man being at this thing?
and i don't mean a ged !
does it matter if he's on the boner pill?
i wouldn't look a gift boner in the mouth .
nice that's very nice , lisa
hey !
how you been?
hey , tom , tom , tommy !
how ya doin '?
oh , you would not believe the day i had .
take this .
i'll get another .
thanks .
harry .
tom .
taking care of the place for me?
we're drilling holes all over your floors
i hope you don't mind .
tom , you know my squaw sheila .
bobby , vanessa .
thanks for having me .
drink up !
take your medicine .
tom , how do you like the neighbourhood?
i grew up in bridgeport , so it's not like it's a foreign country .
you're goddamn right .
this is the best neighbourhood in chicago .
we all look out for each other .
that's saying a lot as we approach the year 2000 .
are you running for mayor
hey , did any of you guys ...
.. see them crank dealers ...
what is lenny doing here?
bobby , did you tell him you had a party?
vanessa made me .
we invited everybody .
to actually invite this jack off ... !
oh , yeah , laugh it up
when you wake up dead with your throat cut , don't come crying to me !
not attracted to .
not drunk enough for .
frightened by !
argh !
don't touch me .
i'm fine .
haven't you heard about people being operated on when they're under hypnosis?
yeah , but i don't believe in any of that .
people who say they were hypnotised were just playing along .
right .
really?
then how could they have a scalpel stuck into their throat without even bleeding?
bullshit !
you never saw that happen !
that's bullshit !
learn another word !
yeah , what about " narrow minded "?
i saw a guy in my class get a two inch needle stuck into his arm by my instructor ...
.. when he was under hypnosis .
horseshit !
that better , honey?
i saw a picture of it the next day .
it left a mark .
what i don't understand is how a person that's been to college ... .. can believe all that superstitious crap .
it isn't superstitious !
come on !
i'm practically a licensed hypnotherapist .
" practically "?
isn't that like saying " i don't have a licence "?
ow !
my arm !
this may come as a surprise to you , but just because you lived here for your whole life ... .. doesn't mean that there isn't a whole larger world out there , ... .. doorways you haven't even opened , things you wouldn't have any understanding of .
doorways ...
ok , ok .
all right , kreskin , prove it hypnotise somebody .
yeah !
do me .
no .
why not?
for one , you're hostile .
i'm not hostile !
do i seem hostile to anybody?
uh ... yeah .
thanks for having us .
it was a great party .
nah , nah , this is just getting good .
come on , lisa .
hypnotise me .
come on !
no .
you're drunk .
i'm not drunk !
you're not supposed to mesmerise somebody who's been drinking !
mesmerise !
no !
stop !
oh , please !
i'm begging you .
educate the savages .
it won't work with that kind of uncooperative attitude .
i swear to you , i'll follow every instruction to the letter .
it still won't work .
come on .
what's the worst that can happen?
somebody turn out the lights .
oh , yeah !
whoo !
all right , just relax .
put your arm down .
just rest it comfortably .
just lean back .
just be very comfortable and relaxed .
trust me .
ok?
close your eyes .
certainly , lisa .
now ... just listen for a moment .
listen to the sounds of the room around you .
i don't know why , but i'm scared .
now i want you to pretend you're in a theatre .
a movie theatre ,
you're the only one there .
it's one of those great old movie palaces .
when you look around , it's a huge , empty theatre .
you notice that the walls of the theatre are painted in black .
the seats ... are covered in black .
and in the whole pitch black theatre , ... .. there's only one thing you can see , and that's the white screen .
you'll notice there are letters on the screen tall , thick , black letters .
but they're out of focus , so you drift closer to them in your chair , trying to read them .
you're very comfortable now .
it's your favourite chair .
you're drifting closer and closer , staring at the letters .
very relaxed now .
your legs are relaxed .
your arms are limp and heavy .
you're almost close enough to read the letters now .
they start to come into focus .
the letters spell " sleep " .
sleep .
no !
what the hell was that?
what?
what?
what?
are you ok?
you had to be faking it .
that was the weirdest goddamn thing i've seen in my life !
congratulations , tom !
you're one of the lucky eight percent !
you still have tears on your cheeks .
what the hell did she do to me?
christ , i'm thirsty .
whaddaya mean?
what eight percent?
there's only eight percent of the population that's , like , highly hypnotisable .
almost anybody can go under a little , ... .. but not way under not freaky under , like he did .
how's your hand?
whaddaya mean?
i stuck a safety pin in your hand and asked you to bleed on one side , but not the other .
which i can't believe you did !
you were very cooperative .
it was a side of you i hadn't seen before .
that happened?
you said it didn't hurt .
to hell with the pin !
i wanna know more about your joey luca .
yeah , right !
who?
joey luca is the kid who ... .. used to pound the shit out of you when you were 12 .
you told us all about it .
you were crying .
it was hysterical !
shut up .
it was very moving , tom .
joey luca !
jesus christ , i haven't thought about him ...
hey .
can we go home?
i ...
i feel kinda strange .
yeah .
yeah , sure .
close your eyes .
uh !
what's the matter?
don't stop .
don't stop .
ok .
ugh !
jesus christ !
oh , my god !
what?
i i ...
i'm seeing things .
what do you mean?
oh , no , no , no .
wait , wait , wait .
i i can't right now .
then you were faking it extremely well .
ohh ...
wait .
stop , stop , stop !
it's too weird .
baby , that wasn't weird .
i could show you weird .
i felt like i was being attacked .
thanks
i'm sorry , i didn't ...
i didn't ...
i i ...
i'll be right back .
what the fuck ...? !
ah ...
agh ...
agh !
arghhh ...
argh !
agh !
agh !
hey , jake .
you're awake now , daddy .
are you ok?
yeah .
yeah , i guess .
i just don't feel so good right now .
don't be afraid of it , daddy .
what was it , then?
an hallucination?
yeah , a bunch of 'em .
it's like all these thoughts just kept coming .
you believe this?
i got seven calls .
well , if it never happened before , it had to be the hypnosis .
i had this headache and i was thirsty as hell .
jake !
i know you're not watching that monster tape again
who was the woman?
i don't know .
maybe somebody i was just remembering .
she didn't look familiar .
did you fuck her?
you gotta be kidding .
no .
i mean , was she someone you used to go out with?
you're jealous of my hallucination?
hmm , you are pregnant !
you should call lisa .
no , she's the one that fucked up my brain .
then she has to unfuck it .
ooh !
agh !
fuck !
fuck !
don't swear so much !
hang on , hang on !
let me get my bearings here .
i have ...
i have absolutely no caffeine in my system , you know .
ok .
you're asking me if i gave you a post ... .. posthypnotic suggestion .
did you leave anything else behind when you were inside my brain?
nothing !
tell the truth , lisa .
tom !
please , this is insulting .
you know , i have done this before .
ok , good .
i i was ...
i was just making sure .
it was just a harmless one anyway .
what?
did it actually work?
what did you say?
i don't wanna tell you .
you're grouchy .
lisa , i swear to god ... !
well , you know i've always said i think you need to be a little more open minded?
yeah ...
so i just said that .
after you wake up , your mind will be completely open , like an open door , ... .. open to receive everything around you .
what's that supposed to do?
fuck if i know !
i never said it before .
why?
did something happen?
jesus christ !
relax .
ok?
i opened a door , that's all .
you know , therapists do it all the time .
it releases repressed memories , whatever you got back there .
for you , it was probably old mannixreruns .
i gotta get back to work .
ok .
alrighty , then
no !
no more calls for lisa !
hey , lise , it's me .
call me when you wake up .
is there any way you could baby sit for us on friday?
i did !
i told him !
what's your name?
ok . .. but then i gotta hear about it for a month .
i called everyone who could possibly do it and no one's free .
call vanessa .
huh?
i said , call vanessa and ask her about debbie .
anyway , call me back .
bye .
debbie?
that's the girl who baby sits for them?
yep .
oh , great idea .
pray she's free .
how'd you know about debbie?
samantha told me .
hey , vanessa .
are you guys going out friday night?
hi .
i'm debbie .
kozak ...?
tom witzky .
hi , debbie .
i'm maggie .
hi .
thanks for coming .
jake's asleep already and he hardly ever wakes up .
a band could play in his room and he wouldn't hear it !
his room's upstairs , kitchen's back there .
just help yourself if you want anything .
here , have a seat .
this is the baby monitor .
it's on b in his room , so you should hear everything .
you wanna watch a movie?
i got a book .
it shouldn't be later than midnight , if that's ok .
perfect .
great .
i'll just grab my coat .
hel lo !
ready?
yeah .
just about .
ok .
hey .
uh ... where'd you find that girl debbie?
vanessa gave me her number .
everybody uses her .
it's cool .
another headache?
too much caffeine .
oh .
ok , let's go .
bye .
i think that damon kid is doing a great job and everything , ... .. and yeah , the kid's got a decent arm , but high school football is about ... .. power , it's about running the goddamn football it always has been .
what did you play in high school?
piano , mostly .
oh , jesus !
sorry .
here , you want some?
anyway , adam ... and i admit that i am biased , ... .. but my kid is having a helluva season and it's like nobody even notices .
if they gave him the ball , he could break a thousand yards !
and that's in an eight game season .
jesus christ !
why don't you just lick 'em when they walk by?
frank says the average guy carries around a hard on two hours out of every day .
three for him .
see , now i got a picture of that !
one of these days , she's gonna find one of my . 38s and pop a cap in my ass !
he'll stick it in a bowl of soup if it's still warm .
go !
go !
are you ok?
yeah .
yeah , i'm fine .
over a thousand yards , we're talking college scholarship !
hey , come on ...
the kid can write his own ticket .
and that's good for everybody .
it's good for the whole goddamn neighbourhood .
he's gonna go a helluva lot further than lever did .
look at the quality of tail he gets .
he passed me in that department when he was 14 .
come on !
while we're young , huh?
you scared me !
she's downstairs , i think .
i don't know .
i haven't seen her yet .

i have a secret to tell you .
promise , promise , promise?

i wanna press charges .
she came here because of me .
i'm her mother .
her mother?
when are you gonna ask about samantha?
who?
my oldest daughter .
she ran away .
no , she was kidnapped , and the little boy said he saw her !
we haven't heard from her in a long time .
we filed a police report .
nobody returns our phone calls .
jake said he talked to her .
he said samantha is in their house .

samantha .
that girl in the picture , she's the same girl i saw on our couch .
see , why ...
why did you ask that girl debbie to baby sit for us?
why her?
i couldn't find anybody else .
i was on the phone and jake said ...
jake?
do you remember the other day when we were talking in the kitchen?
i was looking for a baby sitter , remember?
you said samantha told you about debbie .
do you remember that?
mommy's asking you a question , bud .

can you remember ...
don't ask the boy any more questions .
talk to me .

hey !
hey !
i'm talking to him !
hey , what's the matter with you?
what do you think?
well , i ...
i'm just trying to have a conversation with my kid .
a perfectly normal conversation for a five year old
don't be afraid of it .
why the hell not?
i don't know .
that's what he told me .
this is where it happened .
this is where i saw her .
you're different .
you feel different .
i leaned back and there she was .
she's 18 .
longish hair .
is that what you saw?
i wish you ...
maggie , please !
god !
or ... or maybe you don't see her , huh?
you just hear her?
is that what it is?
tom , stop it !
i need to find a way to make her come back .
maybe if i hang out here long enough , ...
i'm talking to you ! .. maybe she'll come back .
maybe you could talk to her .
help me out here .
hey , come on !
hey !
what's the problem?
knock it off !
i don't wanna talk about this because it scares mommy .
turn it up , man .
what?
turn it up .
up !
tom is looking especially together today .
he grunted a very pleasant greeting at me , actually .
he's becoming sort of monosyilabic .
nothing wrong with that guy .
nothing a little lithium couldn't cure !
i'm a jerk .
i'm sorry .
no ...
are you ok?
over there !
in the door !
if you live on the base , your room and board's covered .
you still gotta get up early .
i'll retire , make a coupla down payments .
when i take off the uniform , i'm a landlord already .
five years later , i got three houses .
hey .
hey , har .
how're ya doin '?
whaddaya know about that girl samantha kozak?
samantha kozak .
why do i know that name?
brownish hair , 16 or 17 years old .
used to live around here .
oh , yeah , yeah .
i remember her , i think .
let's go .
hey , kurt !
come here for a second .
like he ever tells me anything , right?
get over here !
say , you know that kozak girl?
uh ...
debbie .
no , no , no , the other one .
samantha .
oh , you mean the retard .
yeah , she ran away .
yeah , that's right .
i remember that .
so , what about her?
oh , i ...
i just been thinking about her a lot .
why?
her sister baby sat for us .
oh .
this is the first time he's been out in a week .
he hasn't gone to work .
he sleeps 12 hours a night .
he's used up all his sick days .
if he doesn't show up on monday , they'll dock him .
i ...
i can't get him more than six feet from the couch .
why?
that's where she appeared to him .
ah .
i'm not shocked that there's another woman .
of course , the fact that she's dead gives one pause .
we are talking about a ghost here , aren't we , maggie?
she took off , uh ... last march .
with a black guy , i think .
hey , harry .
did she ever live in our house?
no , no , no .
i just ...
i just bought that one .
you're the first tenants .
tom and jake , it's like they have this private club or something .
they sit in the living room and whisper , and , as soon as i walk in , they both shut up .
you know what you need to do?
find a young priest with smouldering good looks ... .. who can guide you through this .
i'm kidding , but i'm not .
look , i give tom a lotta shit , but the truth is , you guys are the best couple on earth .
this is on you now , maggie .
get some help .
find out why this is happening .
there is a reason .
you won't be the first woman who's had to hold an insane family together .
tom's not crazy .
oh , yes he is .
but at least he's getting interesting .
sports flash !
sports flash !
211 yards rushing on friday night .
that's a total of 894 yards , with two games to go .
the kid needs 106 yards .
that's 53 a game .
he could walk through the next two games and still break a thousand !
frank , what about you?
do you know her?
who?
tom was asking about that kozak girl from over by baldwin .
you remember : the one who ran away?
the retard .

close the damn door !
look , you just gotta get outta here .
my husband is losing his mind .
i don't know why , but i think you do .
you can tell me what you know , but you can't tell me to go away because i'm not moving .
how long has he had it?
just a few days .
what happened?
a car wreck?
no .
a child die?
no !
did he kill someone?
he was hypnotised .
is that what started it?
it comes and it goes .
some people have it for five seconds .
some , their whole lives .
he's a receiver now .
everything's coming in .
he can't stop it .
he can't slow it down .
he can't even figure it out .
it's like he's in a tunnel with a flashlight , but the light only comes on once in a while .
he gets a glimpse of something , but not enough to know what it is .
just enough to know it's there .
jake , too .
your son?
much better flashlight .
does he know what it wants yet?
what who wants?
he saw a ghost , didn't he?
what did it ask him to do?
she didn't ask anything .
maybe he wasn't listening .
she's asked for something , and now she's waiting , ... .. getting more and more pissed off that he's not doing it .
if he doesn't do her thing , she'll never go away .
agh !
kill her !
kill her !
kill her !
agh !
agh !
hey !
absolutely not !
oh , please , please , please !
five more minutes .
five more minutes .
no , zero minutes .
oh , this is cool .
" the mummy " gives you nightmares .
no fair !
i know .
i'm gonna take a bath .
are you ok for ten minutes?
whatever !
how do i know this song?
i know i know this song .
i know it .
i know it .
agh !
freezing !
round up your weapons , folks !

i don't wanna talk right now .
hey !

.. en este barrio de mierda a buscar un taxi .
i know .
i ...
well , gracias .
de nada .
ok , you gotta , uh ... slow down .
ok?
you gotta be a little patient with me here cos i got a confession to make .
y'see , we ... we just smoked this great big fatty a few minutes before you walked in , ...
.. so this is blowing my mind a bit extra .
listen to me .
listen to me !
yeah?
whatever ... door you opened in my brain , ... .. l want you to shut it .
now !
ok .
i'll do it .
ok .
i can do that .
close your eyes .
ok .
just like last time , i want you to just focus and concentrate .
listen to the sounds of the room , listen to the sounds of your breathing .
look at the back of your eyelids .
do you see anything there?
could you just get to it , please?
all right .
all right .
i want you to pretend you're back in the movie theatre .
it's very dark , ... .. and in the whole pitch black theatre , the only thing you can see is the white screen .
as you focus on the screen , you begin to drift closer to it in your chair .
you'll notice that there are letters on the screen tall , thick , black letters .
but they're out of focus , so you begin to drift closer to them .
someone's here .
no , it's empty .
but there's someone else in here .
no , you're alone in the theatre , tom .
no .
no , i'm not .
your feet and your ankles are relaxed .
no .
hard to breathe .
your hands are limp and heavy .
your ... your arms ...
no air !
no air !
tom , i want you to look at the screen .
look at the screen .
hey .
you can read the letters now .
you're right up next to them .
tom !
look at the screen !
no !
wow !
what ... what happened?
are you ok?
you need to sit down .
what was happening there was very next level .
you should have seen your face .
d'you want a beer?
are you feeling better?
what happened?
i'm supposed to dig .
hi !
hello? !
anybody home?
wow !
look what i'm not cleaning up .
interesting !
ok !
hi , honey .

dad said i'm supposed to dig .
oh .

tom .
tom !
oh !
you scared me .
i scared you?
what are you doing?
i'm supposed to dig .
whaddaya mean?
i'm supposed to dig .
who says?
i see .
and what's jake doing?
jake ... is helping .
why are you doing this?
the water softens up the dirt .
no .
i mean ...
could you just stop for a second?
tom !
can you turn around and look at me?
what ... exactly don't you understand?
i'm supposed to dig .
why are you digging?
i'm searching .
what are you searching for?
the question is not what .
we both know very well what , even though we don't wanna admit it .
the question , maggie , which you can plainly see i am very busy trying to answer ...
the question is where .
don't worry , he's ok .
it's not over there .
we're calling the police .
and tell them what , exactly?
huh?
practise it !
run it by me once .
i wanna see how it sounds out loud .
anything else?
tom , why don't you come inside with me?
i wanna talk to you .
you're not yourself right now .
this is just fucking typical !
now , what do you want me to do , maggie , huh?
you want me to go inside and just , uh ... sit down on the couch in front of the tv ... .. and drink beer until i fall asleep , and maybe repeat the whole thing again tomorrow?
be quiet !
and the day after and the day after?
oh , just stop !
until ... until ...
until i ...
i grab my chest and die?
i mean , this ... this is the most important thing that's ever happened to me .
i mean , this is ... this is the most ... important thing ... .. that i have ever done in my whole life , in my whole stupid life !
and you want me to just stop? !
no !
no , i won't stop !
i won't stop !
i won't stop !
eight years , i've known you .
not once have you talked to me like this .
not once .
and if you do it again , i swear to god ...
and you know what?
when you talk about how ordinary you are and your stupid life , ... .. you're saying " our stupid life , " which i don't think is particularly stupid .
so how the fuck am i supposed to feel about that?
are you gonna drink that?
i'm sorry .
ok , i'm not sorry .
who's that from?
my brother steve .
my grandma's going back in the hospital .
no , she ...

it was an accident .
the kids come to us , she's already dead .
the damage is done .
there's nothing anybody can do to bring her back .
but these kids got ... everything ahead of them .
so what were we supposed to do , tom?
send our sons to jail for the rest of their lives because of her?
who are you planning to shoot with that?
get the hell outta here , tom .
