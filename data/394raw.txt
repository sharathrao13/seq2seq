are you ok?
thanks for taking my life
huh?
i didn't suffer at all
one blow and i'm in heaven
we had to meet ,
like this ,
on a night like this
it was such a boring evening ,
i was drinking around at this late hour ,
on my way home from work , all alone ...
i was wandering around the city
but i don't find it strange at all
even a tragic meeting like this
isn't a coincidence at all
you and i , " we were destined to meet right now , like this
to see our last dream together
just you and i ,
our last dream ...
hey !
what's wrong with you?
why're you singing all of a sudden?
you're the one i was meant to meet
at the very end ,
and then part
we meet , and then i die
isn't this the most shortlived
and bittersweet love story ever?
between the curtain rising and then falling on the act ,
is only a matter of a few minutes
would you believe that
a love so brief would even exist?
love?
tragedy , you see ,
has a tendency to turn into
a romantic drama
let me see your face more clearly
let's look into our eyes when we talk
that way , " we'll see each other's heart better
we don't have much time ,
before the moon is clouded over
our time together
is short
wait a sec !
what're you talking about?
just speak normally !
we only have one life to live
i tried to live it as preciously as i could " but something went wrong along the way
i just killed you !
how can you talk like that?
i've been living a lie
i've been lying to myself that i don't feel any pain
what?
i've been lying to myself that i don't feel any pain
that's your own business just go off and die on your own
why'd you have to come and show up in my life?
i didn't mean to
look , i didn't mean to kill you
i know
i beg you , just forgive me !
keep me warm
i wanted to be with someone
dance ... !
you were just dancing !
hey
c'mon , just once more !
don't go cold on me !
hlgh voltage
we've apprehended the suspect
give it back !
come back !
get back here !
stop !
he went that way !
stop !
he went up !
up !
i'll shoot , dammit !
don't do anything stupid !
move back !
hey , don't come near me !
move back or i'll shoot her !
move back to where i can't see you hurry !
i'll shoot her for real !
move back , goddammit !
hurry , or i'll shoot !
no reception !
i'll call , sir
evacuate civilians and secure the perimeter !
i'm finished !
yes , we're trying to apprehend the suspect
how'd he steal your gun?
because you weren't paying attention !
don't worry , he doesn't have the guts to pull the trigger
hey you !
you know what you're doing?
let the girl go !
shut up or i'll shoot her !
calm down !
it's not too late
don't make me do it if she gets shot , it's your fault !
you !
don't upset him !
damn , what do i do now?
i haven't thought of anything
a hostage !
jesus , what a drag ...
what am i gonna do about you now?
copy that !
our back up's here , sir
got it tell them not to upset him
the suspect's excited , so please don't upset him
i know !
i'm supposed to demand something , like a helicopter
wait , i get airsick easily
can't believe this is happening to me
shit , i'm probably finished
hey , how come i'm the only one talking here?
say something
a cold one , aren't you?
you're no fun
can you see with that?
sure , i cheated on exams with this
so what do you see?
hey , how about this?
damn , i wanna pull the trigger
my finger's gonna move by itself
he's pointing the gun at his own head
that's not good
man , my finger's itching should i just do it?
why're you so quiet?
you think an idiot like me should just die , don't you?
what the hell !
where's the bullet?
first one's blank next one'll fire , for real
give it back !
drop the gun !
i'll shoot , dammit !
what the fuck !
just go away !
go away !
the last one was blank , but the next one's real !
give back my gun !
i'll kill you !
go back !
good !
hey , hey , what're you doing?
that's dangerous
good job
you're safe , so give that back now
hey there now that's dangerous
what're you doing?
hey , wait a sec
now give it back it's mine
what're you doing?
hey !
give it back , c'mon !
hey , what the hell ...
you're ok now don't worry !
don't worry !
the next one'll go off !
there's no point in doing that , so c'mon , give it up , hurry
get back !
don't upset her !
i got it , i got it ...
that's dangerous !
hand it over !
that's a bad idea just give it up
ok , so i understand how you feel now so give it back now !
give it back !
you're still young you don't wanna die
wait , you wanna die?
you wanna die?
you wanna die , huh?
die , then !
let go !
let go , dammit !
i'd always be thinking on the rooftop , why can't i jump?
i believe meeting someone is never a coincidence
i was waiting for this all along
i'm alive ...
