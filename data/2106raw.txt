i don't
would you think it was funny if your father if jane's father heard you were booked for reckless driving?
okay , don't bring the fathers into this .
i'll never do it again .
do what again?
huh?

what whatever you think i'm doing , dave .
like driving on the wrong side of the road?
well ... yeah , yeah .
or maybe even driving backwards?
hey , dave , that's an idea .
you know that 80 or 90 percent of the accidents are front end jobs .
you know , in australia they got airplanes ... with the seats set in backwards ... so in case you get a collision , they got ... no concu
no good , huh?

hey , what happened?
sergeant bert?
no , no , no .
dave .
oh , you're lucky it wasn't bertsie .
yeah , you're not kidding .
you don't know the half of it .
what?
last night we seen gig's car parked in front of nancy's .
listen to this .
so we decided we'd move it , hide it on him .
so we're moving it down the center of the street ... when along comes sgt. bert .
so mooch tells him we can't get it started , you know?
he says , " i don't care .
you're blocking traffic .
move it out of the way .
so then he gets out of the car , comes over to us ... and he's helping us move gig's car .
just then , gig comes out of the house ... and he's yelling , " who's stealing my car?
i thought bertie would drop his teeth .
i bet he did .
if gig didn't cover for us , we would've been in trouble .
yeah , you know , i'd sure hate to cross bertie again tonight .
hey , what happened with you and dave?
i got a lecture .
promised to be a good boy .
you know , dave's a good guy .
i think we have been steaming him up a little too much .
there's about two inches of rubber on the street outside doc's house .
hey , i almost forgot .
i gotta do something for the doc .
what?
i gotta go up and check on some people .
you wanna come with me?
oh , no , man .
we're going to the flicks .
at this time of night?
yeah , it's a midnight spook bit .
we got some rumors there'd be some unprotected women in the balcony .
well , listen , why don't you come on , come with us .
you can go to the movies after .
it'll only take a half hour .
come on !
it's okay with me .

good bye .
hello?
kate?
dr. hallen .
i'm still at the office .
something's come up .
i'll need your help right away .
no , you've got to come back .
there's a man here with some sort of a parasite on his arm .
it's assimilating his flesh at a frightening speed .
i may have to get ahead of it and amputate .
no , l i don't know what it is or where it came from .
man , look at that , will you?
what is it?
wow , i don't know .
tony , look .
hey , what landed here?
we must be getting close to the front line .
hey , why would anybody leave a lantern here?
i don't know .
what is it , steve?
it's hot .
watch it .
a shooting star?
hey , we saw that too !
a real big one , like a skyrocket .
oh , yeah , about an hour ago .
you think this is it?
i don't know .
let me see .
wow , a real piece of sky .
here , mooch .
you mean that this little pebble has been out there hot roddin 'around the universe?
probably big as the moon when it started .
no kiddin '!
let me see it , mooch .
and this is all that's left?
well , it's all that's here .
i'll bet there is a house close by .
doesn't sound like a house .
it sounds like a dog .
come on , steve .
let's go look .
yeah , sure .
hey , wait a minute .
hey , there's a house .
hey , real nice .
you think anybody's here?
hello?
hello?
doesn't look like there's anybody here at all .
hey , i can't see anything but just that little dog .
oh , steve , open the door and let him out .
okay .
come on .
come on .
come on .
come on .
come on .
come on , pal .
come on .
ohhh .
come on out .
doesn't look like anybody was there at all .
come on .
i guess it's the old man's dog .
don't you worry , baby .
you'll be all right .
think this is the place?
it sure looks like it .
this is a cozy spot .
no neighbors , no cars , no roads , no lights .
yeah , and no movies .
come on , you guys , let's get outta here .
let's go , mooch .
i guess there's nothing else you can find out here , steve .
no , no , i guess not .
why don't you come with us to the spooky show , huh?
you'd like it .
no , no thanks .
ah , you gotta stop takin 'everything so serious like .
gotta live a little .
you gotta go , you know?
yeah , steve , you gotta hang loose , like me .
okay , sure , the spook show .
come on .
let's go , you guys !
yeah , comin '.
steve?
yeah .
what about the dog?
i don't know .
i mean , we can't just leave him here .
he'd starve to death .
yeah , that's right .
couldn't we take him with us?
sure .
i guess that's the least we could do for the old man .
come on , let's go .
oh , hello , kate .
thanks for coming back .
it's okay .
what do you want me to do?
you better take his pulse .
but don't touch that material on his right hand .
it absorbs flesh on contact , like an acid .
doctor , where is he?
what do you mean?
kate , stand still .
don't move .
it must have absorbed the old man completely .
i don't know what this is , but it's got to be killed before it gets any bigger .
oh , doctor , i'm afraid .
try to stay as far away from it as you can .
kate , be calm !
now do as i say .
behind you .
the trichloroacetic acid .
throw it !
throw it?
yes , but for heaven's sake , don't get any of it on your hands .
doctor , nothing will stop it .
a gun .
in my den .
i've got to go for it , kate .
now try to stay absolutely still .
don't go .
don't leave me .
i'll be right back .
doctor , come back !
come back !
kate , what's the matter?
kate !
kate , what is it?
kate !
kate !
listen , you stay there , and i'll go in and tell the doc .
it doesn't look like there's anybody here .
yeah .
well , maybe he took the old man to the hospital .
anyway , i'll check .
okay .
listen , i'm gonna check in the garage and see if the doc's car is there .
oh , okay .
steve .
steve , what's the matter?
steve , tell me what happened .
i can't .
well , what happened?
it was so  steve , what is it?
it's got the doc .
it's got  what's the matter with him?
just like the thing on the old man's hand , only it was bigger .
then it was on his whole head , and then in just a second he disappeared .
he disappeared?
he was all gone .
he was all gone .
you know , he just disappeared .
steve , what are you talking about?
i'm sorry .
get in the car , jane .
well , what are you gonna do , steve?
we're gonna go to the police .
they'll know what to do .
well , we can get someone over there tomorrow .
yeah .
we'll have someone over there first thing in the morning .
well , what's this?
hey , watch it , dave .
don't mix up the pieces .
ritchie , you old buzzard .
i didn't know you were a chess player .
it's like i've been telling you , dave .
you're not the only thinker around here .
it's nothing .
just a hobby , you know?
well , wait .
wait a minute .
i think this is interesting .
who do you play with?
well , late at night when i'm here by myself and things are pretty slow , l
well , you gotta do something .
you oughta take up chess .
loosen up your gray matter a little .
i guess i'd better .
you'll have to teach me , ritchie .
sure , dave .
anytime .
dave , doc hallen's been killed .
doc hallen?
what happened?
you gotta come now !
wait a minute , steve .
tell us what happened .
i'm trying to tell you .
now this thing , it killed the doc .
what was it?
out with it , kid .
well , it's kind of like a ma
it's kind of like a mass that keeps getting bigger and bigger .
come on , steve , make sense .
i know , i know .
look , dave , you gotta see this thing to believe what i'm telling you .
maybe the thing you saw was a ... monster?
yeah , maybe it was .
i don't know .
hold on , jim .
now , what is it , steve?
a little while ago it was driving backwards , and now it's monsters .
look , he's not making it up , dave .
honest .
dave , i'm not kidding .
come on over to the doc's .
you can see it for yourself .
you're crazy if you go .
can't you see it's a gag?
he says doc hallen's dead , jim .
we've got to check it out .
let's go .
ritchie , you mind the store .
dave , listen
east cornwall , downingtown h. q
downingtown , east cornwall h. q.
q to k 2 .
do i read you right?
q to k 2?
roger .
k 9 to kb 5 .
shucks .
this office will be closed all day saturday .
dr. hallen .
wait a minute .
what's the matter?
the thing might be in there waiting for you .
well , we'll have to take that chance , won't we?
i'm not kidding .
dr. hallen?
dr. hallen?
hmm .
seems to be a short circuit in here .
you got your light?
everything looks okay .
there .
i think this is the room i saw him in .
it's locked .
i'll see if i can find a key that'll work .
no , the key's already here .
it's been locked from the inside .
hello?
who's in there?
better go around and see if the window's unlocked .
if it isn't , break the glass , come in and unlock the door .
all right .
you're not gonna let him do that .
now , don't worry , steve .
sergeant bert knows how to handle himself .
and this is the only way to get to the bottom of this .
i'll see if i can find the fuse box .
okay .
steve , i wonder where the little dog is .
yeah .
what do you think happened to him?
i don't know .
well , that's more like it .
this must have been what blew the fuse .
jim?
wait till you get a load of this mess !
ohh .
what about this , steve?
i don't know , dave .
but i know i saw the doc .
all right , kid , cut the act .
what really happened here?
i don't know .
all of a sudden , your mind is a blank?
no .
steve , are you sure this is the room?
yes , i'm sure of it .
this has been fired .
but i haven't seen any shot marks around anyplace .
let me tell you what happened , kid .
you and whoever else was in on this thought you'd put one over on the police .
so you break in here , you mess the place up  wait a minute , jim .
the kids couldn't have done this .
you saw for yourself .
the window was locked from the inside , and so was the door .
they rigged it with string .
it's part of their plan to make us look silly .
i think you're doing that pretty well by yourself , sergeant .
steve , was there anybody else with you?
no .
how about when i stopped you over on morgan street?
those kids had nothing to do with this .
who were they?
why , it was tony and mooch .
those kids?
well , there's your answer right there !
they're just the kind of kids to pull a trick like this .
but this time they've gone too far .
what goes on out here?
land's sakes !
what are you doing here , mrs. porter?
boy oh boy oh boy !
wait till doctor gets back and sees this !
back from where?
lieutenant , was it burglars?
we don't know yet .
where is dr. hallen?
johnsonville .
a medical convention .
you know , i told him this would happen one of these days , the way he leaves everything unlocked .
of course , it was my fault too .
he asked me to keep an eye on the place .
but that's not true , dave .
he never left .
i don't think i've had the pleasure .
this is steve andrews , mrs. porter .
he seems to think the doctor got into some trouble here tonight .
no , sir !
the doctor don't know anything about this .
he called me just before he left .
he didn't leave .
look , dave , i'll bet his car is still in the garage .
might be .
doctor sometimes goes in somebody else's car .
dr. gilpen from over in groverton .
jim , call dr. gilpen .
right .
he won't be home .
just checking .
mrs. porter , did you hear any gunshots tonight?
i sure did !
tonight and every other night .
the people downstairs have those old movies on their television .
there's always some shooting or screaming .
whoever this thief was , he didn't have to tear up the place like this .
i feel terrible .
wait a minute , mrs. porter .
i don't want this touched .
well , i don't want the doctor to come back tomorrow and find the place like this .
it's bad enough the window's broke and all .
but , mrs. porter
now , you boys have your work to do , and i have mine .
there's a criminal walking around out there free as a bird .
you go get him .
let me clean up here .
mrs. porter , you don't understand .
we may want to check here for fingerprints later .
dr. gilpen's on his way to johnsonville .
did he pick up dr. hallen?
i spoke with mrs. gilpen , and she said that dr. hallen had called around 11 : 00 , just after her husband left , but she thought they were going together .
where can we reach them in johnsonville?
i didn't ask her that .
st. john's hotel .
that's where the doctor usually stays .
well , they should be there in a couple of hours .
we'll leave word to have him call us when he checks in .
can't i just dust around the fingerprints?
tomorrow .
well , let's go , kids .
dave , this is all wrong .
all right , kid , the show's over .
it was a cute act , but this time it didn't work .
this locked door business really hung you .
if everything happened like you said , where's the doctor?
and where is this old man?
and where is the big , bad monster?
i don't know .
hand me that small hammer , will ya?
why don't you finish that tomorrow?
i ain't gonna be here .
i'm goin 'on a huntin 'trip .
i didn't know you was a hunter .
neither did i.
we got a little cabin up in the south woods , the boys and me .
and i'm tellin 'you , marty boy , we're goin 'up there this weekend , and i'm gonna get so roarin ', stinkin ', no good drunk ...
i won't be able to see .
hey , why don't you come with us?
it'll do you some good .
oh , i don't think martha would figure it that way .
do you have to tell your old woman everything?
tell her your uncle died .
tell her you're going away so you can love her more when you get back .
good night .
boy , i'm so tired of lookin 'at the guts of secondhand cars ...
i could spit grease .
you know , marty , if i didn't get away once in a while , i'd blow a gasket .
when i come in on monday , if mr. johnson looks at me funny just once just once you know what i'm gonna do to him , marty?
hey , marty !
look , you keep telling me about a monster .
all i want to do is clear this thing up .
all right , i agree .
but i still don't see why you had to call our folks .
dave , it's for you .
what else could i do?
well , give us a chance to find out what happened .
you know we didn't tear up doc's house .
how long have you known me?
all right , i believe you !
but i still don't think you're telling me all you know .
oh , dave .
hello?
yeah .
well , young lady , do you mind telling me where you've been spending the evening?
daddy , it's all right .
oh , yes , everything's fine .
i always stop by the police station to pick up my daughter .
don't you realize what this could do to me?
by morning , it will be all over town .
we were just trying to warn people .
after all , i am principal of the high school .
young man , this is the last time you're ever going to take my daughter out !
steve didn't do anything wrong !
mr. andrews , can you make anything out of all this?
i can't .
take it easy , mr. martin .
we'll straighten everything out .
hello , son .
dad , i saw something terrible tonight .
and nobody'll believe us .
mr. martin , mr. andrews , uh , apparently doc hallen's office was broken into by vandals tonight .
and steve and jane seem to know something about it .
vandals?
my daughter?
well , you don't think our kids were mixed up in it , do you?
all we know is that they told us something had happened over at dr. hallen's house .
we're not accusing anyone of what we found .
we can't be more definite until we contact dr. hallen in johnsonville .
dad , it isn't vandalism !
dr. hallen is dead , and he was killed by some sort of a monster .
now , i know because i saw it , dad .
lieutenant , i want you to know that steve is not in the habit of telling lies .
if he says he's not mixed up in this vandalism , you can be sure it's the truth .
did you see this thing too , jane?
well ...
no , not exactly .
well , look , folks , we'll all know more in the morning after we've called johnsonville .
i think the best thing now is for all of us to go home and get some sleep .
maybe it's a good idea , son .
we can talk about this some more at home .
sure , pop .
get out of the house as fast as you can .
i'll be over .
maybe bertie's right .
maybe this is just a gag like those school fraternities were throwing last year .
remember how they stitched that bathing suit to the statue of general hayes?
i don't think this is a gag .
why didn't you book the kids then?
why make a big thing of it tonight if we can clear the whole thing up tomorrow?
boy , if it was bertie , he'd have them strung up by the thumbs by now .
maybe he would .
police department .
hold on .
it's bertie .
hello?
dave?
yep .
a couple of people thought they heard shots , but weren't sure .
okay , jim .
doc's place locked up?
yeah .
check back in , then .
right .
we'll get the truth out of those kids if it takes all night .
i sent the kids home .
home?
are you crazy?
jim , we'll take care of this whole thing tomorrow .
yes , sir .
is that all?
yes , that's all .
bertie got some idea what this is?
i don't care what bertie's ideas are !
he acts like we're still fighting the war .
just because some kid smacks into his wife on the turnpike ... doesn't make it a crime to be 17 years old !
okay , so i don't know what the kids are up to tonight .
but i'm not gonna throw them into a cell like a couple of vagrants .
we'll put this puzzle together in the morning .
in the meantime , at least we know where the kids are .
hey , where are you going?
oh , shhh , danny .
shhh .
where are you going?
i've got something very important to do , danny , but it's got to be a secret .
i won't tell anybody .
i'll go with you .
no , honey , i have to go by myself .
will you be back pretty soon?
well , i don't know .
aren't you afraid to go out by yourself?
yes , i guess i am , danny .
i'm not afraid .
i'll guard you .
oh , no , danny .
you've got a bigger job to do .
you've got to stay here and guard mommy and daddy .
oh , they don't need guarding .
oh , look , danny , go on to beddie .
look , if you go to bed , i might bring you a little dog all your very own .
a dog !
honest?
honest .
i cross my heart .
oh , boy !
now go on up to bed .
what's his name?
oh , any name you want , danny .
can i name him william?
oh , that's a fine name , danny .
now you better run on up to bed .
go on .
oh , i don't like william .
you run on to bed , honey .
steve?
steve?
was he asleep?
yeah .
do you think he did something wrong?
i don't know .
i don't think so .
the police don't either , or they wouldn't have sent him home .
i felt that he was keeping something from us .
he did seem more willing to talk when we were at the station .
well , i think tomorrow he might talk and we'll be able to straighten this out .
maybe , after a good night's sleep .
yeah .
good night .
'night , dear .
you scared me to death .
what are you doing here?
listen , jane , i told you to wait over there .
the folks went to bed , so i thought i should just come on over .
all right , come on .
let's go around the corner .
steve?
huh?
oh , i'm sorry .
at least i could've thanked you for coming out tonight .
you didn't need to .
i never needed to talk to anyone before , not as much as i do now .
well , we're in this together , aren't we , steve?
you know , i wish that we
i must be getting confused .
i know we saw the old man , i know we took him to the doc's ... and i know the doc sent us out to see if we could find out what happened .
so?
and i know the old man had something on his hand , something he couldn't get off , something that kept getting larger .
i saw that .
and then l i think i saw the doc .
he was standing by the window , and he he was trying to get out ... and that thing was all over him ... and then ... just dissolved while i stood there .
i think i saw this .
i believe you did .
you know , plenty of people in their right mind thought they saw things that didn't exist , you know , like flying saucers .
the light was just right , and the angle and the imagination .
boy , if that's what it is , then this is just an ordinary night .
you and i are gonna go to sleep , and tomorrow when we get up ... that sun's gonna shine , just like yesterday .
good old yesterday .
steve , well , you believe you did see it , don't you?
i don't know . l l
that's not true , steve .
well , maybe , maybe now you don't want to believe it .
maybe you'd like to tell yourself it didn't happen .
but , steve , you're not the kind of person who can turn your back ... on something you know is true .
i don't know .
well , you actually did see what happened to dr. hallen .
how do you know i did?
because i know you .
okay .
now what do we do?
how do you get people to protect themselves from something they don't believe in?
well , you keep trying and hoping you can find ... some sort of proof that'll convince them .
okay .
i don't like it much , but i guess the only way you can find that is to go out and look for it .
i'll go get the car .
you sure you want to go with me?
yes .
i wouldn't give much for our chances ... wandering around in the middle of the night trying to find something ... that if we found it , it might kill us .
if we could only find a couple of people to help us .
hmm .
who?
well , your friends , tony , mooch and al .
hey , you know , that that's worth a try .
yes , i am here , the demon who possesses your soul .
wait a bit .
i am coming for you .
i have so much to show you .
tony , listen , i wanna see you outside .
hey , what gives?
i thought you cats didn't dig spooky shows .
this is important .
outside .
hey , what's up?
shhh .
i'll explain outside .
this is important .
you missed most of the picture .
you're not gonna get your money's worth .
none of us are , unless somebody keeps quiet .
you're gotta come with us .
there's nobody else we can go to .
okay , you kids , knock it off .
come on !
what?
walk out of the movie?
let's cut out .
you cats gonna make it?
not me .
i'm part of this chair , and i can't move .
tsk .
hold up , mooch !
hey , all right , steve , you made us waste our 80 cents .
now , what gives?
yeah , what's the scoop?
what's the big idea , steve?
would you believe me if i told you there was something inside of that rock we found , something that could wipe out this whole town?
knock it off !
go ahead , steve .
i saw this thing kill dr. hallen tonight .
kill dr. hallen?
that's right .
well , what is it?
i don't know .
but one thing's for sure , if it can kill dr. hallen , it can kill somebody else .
what do you want us to do , steve?
all right , we're gonna find this thing , and we're gonna make people believe us .
let's try johnsonville again , ritchie .
okay .
i just saw a strange one .
what do you mean?
on my way back here , i ran into mr. connors coming outta that bar ... in the building he owns over on second street .
he'd just stopped in , and there was nobody there .
queerest thing i've ever seen .
tv was playin 'away .
the cash register was there with the money still in it .
nobody around .
no bartender , nobody .
i'll look in there on the way home .
forget it .
the place is all locked up now .
why don't you go home and get some shut eye?
you can't run our shift and yours too , you know?
yeah , i know .
i wish i knew where those two doctors were , though .
any luck , ritchie?
nope , they're not there .
want me to call the other hotels?
there's a lot of them between here and johnsonville .
no .
i guess you're right .
i guess there's nothing here that won't wait till morning .
well , i'll see you guys .
good night .
good night .
well , hello , kids !
come on in !
you're just in time for the fun .
we came to warn you .
huh?
how?
we came here just to warn you  oh , a warning !
well , that's fine .
i didn't know you cared .
hey , folks !
i want you to meet paul revere , and this is mrs. revere .
they've come to give us a warning about something important .
the british are coming !
excuse me .
we were just just looking for a monster .
monsters?
you must've been talking to that guy from second street .
man , i don't know what they're serving over there , but it sure must be great stuff .
listen , we're trying to tell you .
we don't wanna get served .
look , i have monsters in here all the time , so beat it .
we don't serve kids anyway .
where is he?
over there , in the doorway of your dad's store .
come on .
come on .
come on .
hey !
that's funny .
the door's not locked .
do you think it's been open all night?
well , i don't know .
this is friday .
the store closes at 10 : 00 , and then old mr. weinermeyer sweeps up ... and then he collects all the push carts .
huh .
he works around for a couple of hours before he locks up , but i'm sure he'd never be this late , not
hey , mr. weinermeyer?
hey , mr. weinermeyer , where are you?
i'm gonna turn on the light .
steve , what is it?
i don't know .
oh .
it's a broom and stuff that mr. weinermeyer cleans up with .
it's spread all over the aisle .
what's the matter?
jane !
here .
you all right?
yes .
steve !
oh , steve , our parents !
they think we're home in bed asleep , sound and safe .
steve , it's the little dog !
now listen !
everything's gonna be all right .

it's gonna be all right .
i don't know if we can stop that thing .
the dog , steve .
take it easy , jane .
oh , steve , the little dog !
don't cry , jane .
there's nothing we can do about it .
now , jane , just put this on .
it'll be all right .
oh , steve , what are we gonna do?
i don't know .
that thing probably isn't far away .
we've gotta get out of here before it comes back for us .
now , come on .
all right?
there they are !
hey , where you kids been?
hey , it's in there !
you're kidding !
i wish i were kidding .

oh , steve !
what do we do now?
we're gonna call the police .
they want evidence .
there's a phone at the corner !
hmm .
go on !

i'm supposed to be home asleep .
if they think i'm loose , they'll never believe us .
yeah , here's a dime .

yeah , how?
any way we can think of .
we've got to stop being a baby sitting service and start being a police department .
just kids , jim .

that's about he craziest argument i've ever heard .
every criminal in the world was a kid once .
what does it prove?
you know what i think?
i think they've got it in for me .
you?
yeah .
they've heard about my war record , and it bugs them .
they're trying to break me down , see what makes me tick .
anything they can try , they try .

dave , make 'em listen to me !
there is a monster !
we saw it again in dad's store .
dave , it's bigger now .
your story's gotten bigger now , kid .
dave , look at me !
do i look like somebody who's playing a practical joke?
am i laughing ... or am i scared stiff?
what are you gonna do?
he's telling the truth .
oh , wait a minute !
it's one thing to make a fool out of yourself , but it's another thing to make a fool out of the police department and the town .
he's right , lieutenant .
you've been wrong before .
maybe i have !
but as long as i'm in charge of this town's police force ,
i'm gonna handle this thing the way i see fit .
and your job right now is to help me restore some order around here .
yes , sir .
okay , everybody , quiet down a minute .
quiet down , please !
listen , this is an emergency , and it can affect every one of us .
that's all i can tell you right now .
but we're trying to get things under control .
in order to do that , we have to clear this area immediately .
so please go home and stay there .
we'll keep in touch with you through your radio station .
now , be careful pulling your cars out of this area .
go home slowly and quietly .
just keep calm .
everything's gonna be all right .
anything i can do to help?
lieutenant , what's going on?
ask your daughter , mr. martin .
she can tell you more than i can .
phil , can your boys give us a hand clearing this area?
sure .
do you have any guns?
a couple of'em .
get 'em .
say , dave , what is this thing?
i don't know .
but if it's in the market , we'll all know in a few minutes .
now all the images of horror , the demons of your mind crowd in on you to destroy you .
phil , can you move your truck over to the door ... and shine your big light into the market?
sure , dave .
all right .
what the
hey , who's in the store?
huh?
there's nobody in here but us monsters .
dave , it's at the theater !
don't go in , jim .
this won't do any good .
it's the most horrible thing i've ever seen in my life .
so what is it?

all right , step back !
everybody step back !
here it comes !
danny !

let's see if we can get out the back .
wait a minute !
what's this?
what happened?
it's all over us .
what do you mean?
what's the matter?
take it easy !
jim , get the telephone company .

i'm not gonna stay here !
now , wait a minute !
you open that door , and we've had it !
you wanna die?
what are we supposed to do?
hello?
yeah .
steve?
that thing is all over us !
watch out !
i don't think it can be killed .
we've gotta try one more thing .
okay .
is everybody all right?
okay , but not for long .
we can drop a power line on it .
do you understand?
there should be enough juice in that line to burn the thing to a crisp .
yeah , get everyone down in the cellar .
we'll do it in 60 seconds , steve .
cellar !
okay .
jim , here's a rifle .
take the phone , ritchie .
all right .
dave , this baby should do the trick .
it's all set to go .
try not to miss , jim .
okay , let's have those lights !
fifteen seconds .
it's quiet now .
i think the upstairs is clear .
good .
keep your ear to that phone , ritchie .
okay , jim .
it didn't work .
why don't you do something?
do something !
elizabeth .
the diner's on fire .
can't we put it out?
any suggestions how?
anyway , not enough oxygen in there to keep a fire going for ten minutes .
there's something burning .
listen , is there any other way out of here?
the windows .
hey , now you be quiet .
shhh .
i'm not afraid .
well , i know you're not .
hey , listen , jane
it'll be all right .
honey , lay your head down and try to go to sleep .
everything will be all right , danny .
hey , there's the fire !
i'll stop it !
wait a minute .
let me have that a minute .
co2 !
hey , that's it !
it's cold !
that's why it didn't come in the ice box after us .
it can't stand cold .
you got any more of these things?
huh?
no .
this thing's running out .
the phone .
hey , dave !
hey , dave !
hey , da anybody on the phone?
hey , dave !
dave , can you hear me?
co2 !
dave !
what did he say?
al , what's up?
shhh .
quiet .
co2?
phil !
phil , do you got any co2 extinguishers?
not many .
some soda acid .
well , get the co2s out here and start hitting around those cellar windows .
what?
just do it , phil !
and check these buildings for fire extinguishers .
but only the co2 kind .
bring back every one you can get your hands on .
all right .
okay .
hey , maybe we can help .
let's get some guys together .
lieutenant , i know where there are 20 extinguishers good .
where?
at the high school .
who can go with me?
hey , right here , mr. martin .
well , what are we waiting for?
let's go .
okay , let's go .
over here , mr. martin .
this thing's running out !
hey , dave !
dave?
dave , co2 fire extinguishers !
dave , can you hear me?
co2 !
okay , come on .
oh , it's locked .
of course it's locked .
here comes mr. martin .
here comes the principal .
we could only find four or five of these things , dave .
how many of them do you need?
a lot more than that .
keep looking .
it's all we can do .
okay .
dave , colonel spaulding got me through to washington .
they thought i was crazy at first , but they're getting someone now .
hey , here come the kids !
our power's still out , so we can't do much in the way of refrigeration .
we think we've got it under control , but we won't rest easy until it's frozen solid .
now
no , it's too big for that , and it's impossible to cut it .
no , sir , a bomb would spread it all over the country .
look , this thing has killed probably 40 or 50 people since last night .
in a few hours , we're gonna have the sun overhead .
i think you should send us the biggest transport plane you have ... and take this thing up to the arctic or somewhere where it'll never thaw out .
oh , daddy !
oh , daddy !
let me see you , son .
let me see my boy .
nice work , steve .
you okay?
yeah , i'm okay .
dave , listen , i wanna
well , i wanna thank you for getting us out of there .
you know , for a while , i didn't think we were gonna make it .
that makes two of us .
what are they gonna do with that thing , dave?
well , the air force is sending a globemaster in .
they're flying it to the arctic .
it's not dead , is it?
no , it's not .
just frozen .
i don't think it can be killed .
but at least we've got it stopped .
yeah , as long as the arctic stays cold .
