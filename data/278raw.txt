pukch'ong coast , north korea
look , what is this?
i'm supposed to ...
colonel tan sun moon's h. q. de militarised zone north korea
open the bag .
that will teach you to lecture me .
retract the blast doors .
find me a new anger therapist .
i am zao .
you are late .
mr. van bierk .
i've been looking forward to this meeting .
me too .
my african military friends owe you many thanks , colonel moon .
few men have the guts to trade conflict diamonds since the u. n. embargo .
i know all about the u. n. i studied at oxford and harvard .
majored in western hypocrisy .
from your modest collection of cars , i wouldn't have guessed .
show me the diamonds .
show me the weapons .
bring the weapons .
hiding weapons in the de militarised zone .
it's a bit of a minefield out there .
america's cultural contribution .
one million landmines .
and my hovercrafts float right over them .
rpgs , flamethrowers , automatic weapons ... ... and enough ammunition to run a small war .
my diamonds?
check it over quick .
don't blow it all at once .
i have special plans for this consignment .
his name is james bond , a british assassin .
mr. van bierk , let me show you something .
our new tank buster .
depleted uranium shells , naturally .
naturally .
and how do you propose to kill me now , mr. bond?
it's pathetic that you british still believe you have the right to police the world .
you will not live to see the day all korea is ruled by the north .
then you and i have something in common .
who is it?
where's my son?
it's the general .
hello ...
father .
why is there a fire?
i'll be there in five minutes .
get the weapons out of here . ... and kill the spy .
saved by the bell .
my son is dead .
14 months later
i don't condone what they do here .
i don't condone what they do here .
tell it to the concierge .
still you jest .
defiant to the last .
your people have abandoned you .
your very existence denied .
why stay silent?
it doesn't matter anymore .
things are out of my hands .
we reach the end , mr. bond .
spare me the unpleasantries .
spare me the unpleasantries .
fifty years after the superpowers carved korea in two ... ... and then you arrive .
a british spy , an assassin .
and now the hard liners have their proof .
we cannot trust the west .
you ...
you took away my son .
your firing squad should have done the job for me .
i hoped a western education would help him become a bridge ... ... between our worlds .
but all it did was to corrupt him .
let's get this over with , shall we?
my son had an ally in the west .
for the last time , who was it?
who made him betray his country and name?
the same person who betrayed me .
turn around .
start walking .
keep walking , please .
keep moving .
zao .
i'm being traded ... ... for you .
keep moving .
keep walking , please .
your time will come .
not as soon as yours .
keep walking , please .
look at him .
double check .
you'd think he was some kind of a hero .
reference nine .
sir .
section four .
okay , hold him tight .
got him .
watch his legs now .
all right , let's go .
no biological agents in the prelim scan .
he's clean .
pulse , 72 .
blood pressure , 120/ 80 .
indications of neurotoxins , histamine , serotonin and enzyme inhibitors .
scorpion venom .
note also traces of a venom antiserum .
they'd sting him then administer the antidote .
yet his internal organs seem unaffected .
liver not too good .
it's definitely him then .
morning .
welcome back .
such hospitality .
you don't seem too pleased to see me .
if i'd had my way , you'd still be in north korea .
your freedom came at too high a price .
zao .
he tried to blow up a summit between south korea and china .
took out three chinese agents before he was caught .
and now he's free .
i never asked to be traded .
i'd rather die than let him loose .
you had cyanide .
threw it away years ago .
what is this?
the top american agent ... ... in the north korean high command was executed a week ago .
the americans intercepted a signal from your prison naming him .
and they think it's me?
you were the only inmate .
they concluded you cracked and were hemorrhaging information .
we had to get you out .
and what do you think?
with the drugs they gave you , you wouldn't know what you said .
i know the rules .
and number one is , no deals .
get caught and you're given up .
the mission was compromised .
moon got a call exposing me .
he had a partner in the west .
even his father knew .
whether that's true or not , it's irrelevant .
no , it isn't .
the same person who set me up then set me up to get zao out .
so i'm going after him .
you're going to our evaluation center in the falklands .
double o status rescinded .
along with my freedom?
for as long as i deem necessary , yes .
you're no use to anyone now .
he's in cardiac arrest .
get the crash cart .
notify his superiors .
he's flat lining on the ecg .
stand by .
two hundred joules .
three hundred .
get me some atropine .
we're losing him !
stand by .
clear .
i'm checking out .
thanks for the kiss of life .
security breach on level three .
all personnel , defensive code red .
apprehend and detain with force .
security breach on level three .
all personnel , defensive code red .
apprehend and detain with force .
security breach on level three .
all personnel , defensive code red .
my goodness , standards are falling .
no tie , dear me .
my usual suite , please .
do you have a credit card?
or even any luggage , sir?
mr. bond , so good to see you .
it's been a long time .
mr. chang .
open the presidential suite .
send up my tailor .
and some food .
the lobster's good , with quails 'eggs and sliced seaweed .
and if there's any left , a '61 bollinger .
of course .
do it ... quickly .
been busy , have we , mr. bond?
just surviving , mr. chang .
just surviving .
i am peaceful fountains of desire , the masseuse .
i come with compliments of the manager .
i'm sure you do .
come in .
on the bed , please .
face down .
yes , of course .
i'm not that kind of masseuse .
i'm not that kind of customer .
you think i haven't always known you're chinese intelligence , chang?
hong kong is our turf now .
don't worry about it .
i'm not here to take it back .
put your hands down .
what the hell do you want?
just to help you settle a score .
zao killed three of your men .
you get me into north korea , i'll take care of him for you .
what's in it for you?
chance to get even .
zao has information i need .
i'll have to ask beijing .
do it .
now get out .
unless you really wanna give me a massage .
mr. bond .
a little thank you from us .
cuba?
it seems mr. zao has lost himself in havana .
if you find him , say goodbye from us .
with pleasure .
havana
i'm here to pick up some delectados .
delectados?
we haven't made delectados in 30 years .
universal exports .
check with your boss .
raoul ...
universal exports .
follow me .
your passport , seor .
i'd come to think the delectados would never be smoked .
they are particularly hazardous for one's health , mr ...?
bond .
mr. bond .
do you know why?
it's the addition of the volado tobacco .
slow burning .
it never goes out .
just like a sleeper .
sorry for the rude awakening .
i love my country .
i'd never ask you to betray your people .
i'm after a north korean .
a tourist?
a terrorist .
one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter .
zao has no interest in other people's freedom .
i still have some friends in high places .
favors called in .
some dollars spread about .
we find your friend is here , on an island .
in los organos .
there is a strange clinic run by dr. alvarez .
he leads the field in gene therapy .
increasing the life expectancy of our beloved leaders .
and , of course , the richest westerners .
we may have lost our freedom in the revolution ... ... but we have a health system second to none .
you didn't do too badly out of the revolution .
we all have our ways of getting by .
you'd be surprised how many government officials come to me ... ... for reminders of the decadent times .
yeah , well ...
mind if i borrow these?
please .
my sources tell me this zao is very dangerous .
i wish i could give you more help .
i could use a fast car .
mojito , por favor .
mr. krug , your admittance papers for the alvarez clinic .
about bloody time , fidel .
round up more girls and take them to room 42 .
unless you want to be known as fidel castrato .
magnificent view .
it is , isn't it?
too bad it's lost on everybody else .
mojito?
you should try it .
giacinta johnson .
my friends call me jinx .
my friends call me james bond .
jinx , you say?
born on friday the 13th .
do you believe in bad luck?
let's just say my relationships don't seem to last .
i know the feeling .
the predators usually appear at sunset .
and why is that?
it's when their prey comes out to drink .
too strong for you?
i could learn to like it .
if i had the time .
how much time have you got?
until dawn .
what about you?
i'm just here for the birds .
ornithologist .
ornithologist , huh?
now there's a mouthful .
so you're gonna be busy tonight with the owls then?
no owls in los organos .
nothing to see till the morning .
not out there anyway .
so , what do predators do ... ... when the sun goes down?
they feast ... ... like there's no tomorrow .
are you always this frisky?
i've been missing the touch of a good woman .
who says i'm good?
what do you want?
i don't need a wheelchair .
no?
you do now .
seor .
okay .
gracias .
isla los organos
so you are to have dna replacement therapy .
let me explain the two phases .
first , we kill off your bone marrow .
wipe the dna slate clean .
introduction of new dna harvested from healthy donors .
orphans , runaways ... ... people that won't be missed .
i like to think of myself as an artist .
and this is when i create .
thank you .
it is a painful process , i'm afraid , but ... ... all great art is .
i'll certainly enjoy working on you .
of course , most artists are only truly appreciated ... ... after they're dead .
my father was a sergeant .
we lived in hampshire .
i have fond memories of the countryside .
good .
got your attention .
who's bankrolling your makeover , zao?
same person who set me up in north korea?
james?
what's going on?
jinx , you gotta get out of here now !
move !
move !
move it !
let's go !
you see , my friend , the chemical composition shows ... ... this is from sierra leone .
conflict diamonds .
there's some kind of marking here .
" gg .
let me see .
yes .
from the graves corporation in iceland .
that's his laser signature .
a man called gustav graves discovered diamonds there ... ... a year or so ago .
yet they're identical to conflict diamonds .
what an amazing coincidence .
how can he escape from a british warship ... ... in the middle of hong kong harbor , right under your nose?
interesting station , moneypenny?
i got a storm warning .
you were supposed to throw away the key ... ... not leave the door wide open .
are you implying i had a hand in his escape?
well , bond got away real fast , didn't he?
it is what he's trained to do .
your boy's been very busy .
he torches a clinic in cuba .
listen , you put your house in order ... ... or we're gonna do it for you .
your drink , sir .
lucky i asked for it shaken .
when's he coming?
i don't know .
looks like your man won't make it .
he's right on time .
wonderful day to become a knight .
will you be using your title , mr. graves?
i'm proud of my adopted nation , but i'd never stand on ceremony .
after that entrance , you can't be surprised ... ... you're called a self publicizing adrenaline junkie , can you?
i prefer " adventurer .
we've heard about the icarus space program .
what's the secret?
it's a surprise .
you'll soon be enlightened .
you work 24l7 .
is it true that you don't need sleep?
you get one shot at life .
why waste it on sleep?
aren't you trying out for the olympic fencing team?
we hear you're training furiously .
i never get furious .
as they say in fencing , " what's the point?
thank you .
we don't want to keep her majesty waiting any longer .
mr. graves .
mr. graves .
hit .
that's a hit .
hit .
verity?
james bond .
your lesson .
i see you handle your weapon well .
i have been known to keep my tip up .
do you mind?
i think i've come undone .
why not?
hit .
positions .
play .
feast your eyes on the finest blade in the club .
gustav graves?
his publicist , miranda frost .
my protg .
gorgeous , isn't she?
she took the gold at sydney .
by default , if i remember .
default?
the one who beat her od'd on steroids .
miranda deserved that gold .
now she's teaching graves how to win one .
he only plays for cash .
he's won so much , nobody else wants to fight him .
you wanna meet him?
absolutely .
lead on .
gustav?
verity .
and mr ...?
bond .
james bond .
have we met before?
i think i'd remember .
of course you would .
my mistake .
are you a gambling man , mr. bond?
lf the stakes are right .
a thousand a point too much for you?
care to place a bet , verity?
no , thanks .
i don't like cockfights .
shall we?
excuse me .
best of three hits?
positions .
ready .
play .
en garde .
hit .
positions .
play .
hit .
two nil .
do you want to continue?
you wanna up the wager?
how much can you afford?
let's play for this .
i picked it up in cuba .
i believe it's one of yours .
my , my .
they do get around .
but then diamonds are for everyone .
brilliant specimen .
completely flawless .
and chemically identical to african conflict diamonds .
then you're about to lose something very precious .
positions .
ready .
play .
en garde .
oh , dear .
you want to continue?
of course i want to bloody continue !
but since we're upping the wager ... ... let's up the weapons , shall we?
let's do this the old fashioned way .
first blood drawn from the torso .
that is enough !
it's just a little sport , miranda .
seems you beat me , mr. bond .
settle downstairs , shall we?
you're a rare challenge , mr. bond .
i'm putting on a scientific demonstration in iceland at the weekend .
icarus?
perhaps you could join us .
miranda , make the arrangements .
once i've smoothed things over with the club .
what would i do without you?
can i expect the pleasure of you in iceland?
i'm afraid you'll never have that pleasure .
excuse me , commander bond .
someone left this for you .
place needed redecorating anyway .
i heard of this place .
never thought i'd find myself here .
some things are best kept underground .
an abandoned station for abandoned agents .
your calling card .
so , what have you got on graves?
you burn me ... ... and now you want my help?
did you expect an apology?
i know you'll do whatever it takes to get the job done .
just like you .
the difference is , i won't compromise .
well , i don't have the luxury of seeing things as black and white .
while you were away , the world changed .
not for me .
you're suspicious of graves , or i wouldn't be here right now .
so , what do you have?
nothing beyond the official biography .
orphan working in a diamond mine ... ... learns engineering , makes a huge find in iceland and gives half of it to charity .
from nothing to everything in no time at all .
and his demonstration this weekend?
probably just another publicity stunt .
tell me what you know about this cuban clinic .
gene therapy .
new identities courtesy of dna transplants .
so called " beauty parlor . " we'd heard rumors .
i didn't think it really existed .
it doesn't anymore .
zao got away , but he left these behind .
all from gustav graves 'mine .
i think it's a front for laundering african conflict diamonds .
we need to tread carefully .
graves is politically connected .
lucky i'm on the outside , then .
it seems you've become useful again .
then maybe it's time you let me get on with my job .
forgive my mentioning it , but a perfect marksman ... ... isn't really supposed to shoot his own boss .
check the replay .
you'll find he's dead and she's only got a flesh wound .
there's always an excuse , isn't there , double o zero?
give me the old firing range any day .
yes , but it's called the future , so get used to it .
so this is where they keep the old relics , then , eh?
this is where our most cutting edge technology is developed .
point taken .
must you touch everything?
does this still work?
now , look ...
so where is this cutting edge stuff?
i'm trying to get to it .
weapon , please .
one pane unbreakable glass , one standard issue ring finger .
twist so .
voil .
ultra high frequency single digit sonic agitator unit .
you're cleverer than you look .
better than looking cleverer ... ... than you are .
follow me .
now , a new watch .
this will be your 20th , i believe .
how time flies .
yes , well , 007 ... ... why don't you establish a record by returning this one .
your new transportation .
maybe you've been down here too long .
the ultimate in british engineering .
you must be joking .
as i learned from my predecessor ... ... i never joke about my work .
aston martin call it the vanquish , we call it the vanish .
very good .
adaptive camouflage .
tiny cameras project the image they see ... ... onto a light emitting polymer skin on the opposite side .
to the casual eye , as good as invisible .
ejector seat , torpedoes , target seeking shotguns to shoot down mobile objects .
the manual .
should be able to shoot through that in a couple of hours .
just took a few seconds , q.
wish i could make you vanish .
come in .
before you leave on your mission for iceland ... ... tell me what you know of james bond .
he's a double o.
a wild one , as i discovered today .
he'll light the fuse on any explosive situation ... ... and be a danger to himself and others .
kill first , ask questions later .
his method is to provoke and confront .
a man nobody can get close to .
a womanizer .
you're going to be seeing a lot more of him in iceland .
with great respect , a man like him could blow my cover .
you volunteered for this , but in three months , you've found next to nothing .
graves seems to be clean .
mix things up a little with mr. graves .
with you there ... ... things won't get out of hand .
in your three years in cryptology , you've kept business and pleasure separate .
you haven't fraternized with any of your fellow agents , despite several advances .
it would be foolish to get involved with someone within the community .
especially james bond .
i'm mr. kil .
well , there's a name to die for .
three hundred and twenty four miles an hour .
a new personal best .
thruster two cut out again .
get it fixed .
glad you could make it .
like my run?
you were on the edge of losing control .
it's only by being on the edge that we know who we really are .
under the skin .
take your donald campbell .
1967 , the bluebird .
water speed record .
campbell died on his return run .
but he died chasing a dream .
isn't that the way to go?
i'd rather not go at all .
you don't chase dreams , you live them .
a virtue of never sleeping .
i have to live my dreams .
besides , plenty of time to sleep when you're dead .
mr. bond .
miss frost .
i'll show you your room .
a palace of ice .
you must feel right at home .
this was built for tonight's demonstration .
the human element necessitates a balance of heat and cold .
built on a lake?
hope graves got things right .
what's that property next door?
the diamond mine .
and gustav's living quarters .
thank you .
this is you .
wonderful .
would you like to show me more?
vodka martini .
plenty of ice , if you can spare it .
mojito?
james .
here for the penguins this time?
or for the view again?
i'm only interested in endangered species .
well , does that include me?
depends on what you're up to this time .
so i left you in an explosive situation .
figured you could handle yourself .
no wonder your relationships don't last .
i just don't like to get tied down .
you look terrible .
you aren't looking too good yourself .
you're still feeling the side effects?
the insomnia is permanent for me .
an hour on the dream machine keeps me sane .
what happened to you?
bond .
he knows nothing .
i've been this close to him ... ... and he didn't know who i really was .
you saw my father after your exchange?
yes .
general moon still mourns your death .
my death .
mr. bond .
and miss ...?
swift .
space and technology magazine .
really?
i take it mr. bond's been explaining his big bang theory?
yeah , i think i got the thrust of it .
i see .
the demonstration's about to begin in five minutes .
shall we?
shall we?
not " jinx " anymore?
i'll always be a jinx to you .
those little shards of heaven known as diamonds .
diamonds aren't just expensive stones .
they are the stuff of dreams .
and the means to make dreams real .
imagine being able to bring light and warmth to the darkest parts of the world ... ... being able to grow crops year round , bringing an end to hunger .
imagine a second sun ... ... shining like a diamond in the sky .
let there be light .
i give you icarus !
icarus is unique .
its miraculous silver skin will inhale the sun's light ... ... and breathe it gently upon the earth's surface .
you have no idea how much icarus is about to change your world .
you have no idea how much icarus is about to change your world .
and now let us brighten this night with our inner radiance .
all right , that's a wrap .
vlad , show me the modifications .
yeah .
here is the self defense mechanism you asked me to build in .
fifty thousand volts?
a hundred .
armed ... ... and very dangerous .
very .
m warned me this would happen .
that's why you tried not to be interested in me .
god , you're even worse than your file says .
they don't look too convinced .
come on , put your back into it .
i know all about you .
sex for dinner , death for breakfast .
not gonna work with me .
no?
no .
you're getting good at this .
stop it .
are we still being watched?
they left ages ago .
god , you're impossible .
let's get out of here .
you'd better stay here .
keep up the charade of being lovers .
all right .
i admire your restraint .
you were here a full two hours before anything blew up .
the way you're going , you'll get us both killed .
james , tell me what really happened in north korea .
i was betrayed .
that was all .
occupational hazard .
this is crazy .
you're a double o.
it's only a number .
james ... ... be careful .
go back to your room .
i'll come back for you .
why do you want to kill me?
i thought it was the humane thing to do .
who sent you?
your mama .
and she's really disappointed in you .
i'll let you in on a little secret .
this mine is fake , but the lasers ... ... are real .
she won't talk .
let's make it permanent .
i'll use the laser .
don't leave a mess .
jinx?
james !
james !
no , no !
turn it off !
off !
off !
james , i could use a little help here .
switch it off ... ... or i'll be half the girl i used to be .
so , the girl who hates to be tied down , huh?
are you gonna get me off this?
what are you , cla?
nsa .
we're on the same side .
doesn't mean we're after the same thing .
sure it does .
world peace , unconditional love ... ... and our little friend with the expensive acne .
zao?
yeah , zao .
he's back there with some weird , psychedelic light mask .
probably brought it from the clinic in cuba .
he couldn't have brought it .
it was already here .
it belongs to another korean .
his boss .
we need kil to help us get out of here .
i got a better idea .
i'm going to get backup .
wait .
go to miranda first .
she's ml6 .
warn her to get out .
and what are you gonna do?
unfinished business .
so you live to die another day ... ... colonel .
at last .
i was beginning to think you'd never guess .
was it painful?
the gene therapy?
you couldn't possibly imagine .
good .
i'm glad to hear that .
but there have been compensations .
like watching you flail around in your ignorance .
granting you life just to see if you'd get wise .
it's been fun .
well , the fun is about to come to a dead end .
we only met briefly , you and i ... ... but you left a lasting impression .
when you forced me to present the world with a new face ... ... i chose to model the disgusting gustav graves on you .
just in the details .
that unjustifiable swagger .
your crass quips , a defense mechanism concealing such inadequacy .
my defense mechanism is right here .
so , miss frost is not all she seems .
looks can be deceptive .
yes .
did you find out who betrayed you in north korea?
only a matter of time .
you never thought of looking inside your own organization?
she was right under your nose .
it was so good of you to bring your gun to bed .
yes .
occupational hazard .
you see , i have a gift .
an instinct for sensing people's weaknesses .
an instinct for sensing people's weaknesses .
yours is women .
hers and mine is winning , whatever the cost .
her brains , her talent ... ... even her sex .
the coldest weapon of all .
hello .
miranda?
there will be others after me .
you mean your american friend , jinx .
soon to be the victim of a tragedy .
an ice palace can be a treacherous place .
hand over the toys .
oh , yeah .
you know , i've missed your sparkling personality .
how's that for a punch line?
kill him .
i enjoyed last night , james ... ... but it really is death for breakfast .
kill him , quietly .
kill him .
now !
he got away .
no matter .
the pleasure of the kill is in the chase .
bring me the generals .
gentlemen ... ... i promised you a demonstration .
now you will see the true power of icarus .
the western spy runs , but he cannot hide .
icarus will lock on to the heat signature and concentrate the sun's power .
hey , boss , he beat your time .
time to draw the line .
global warming is a terrible thing .
yeah , nice moves , just like bond .
he was pretty vigorous last night as well .
he did you?
i didn't know he was that desperate .
he's not coming for you .
he just died running , trying to save his own skin .
that's pretty good tailoring .
i hope it doesn't shrink when it gets wet .
soon , we will be victorious .
we've got one hour to wrap this up .
let's move .
come on , jinx , where are you?
all units report .
now !
warning , adaptive camouflage failure .
time to give the american her bath .
adaptive camouflage restored .
vlad , does the word " ergonomics " mean anything to you?
man?
machine?
this is still a suitcase .
finish it , will you?
come on , it's warm in here .
come on .
the cold kept you alive , huh?
it must've kept you alive .
come on .
what took you so long?
i'm sorry .
agent johnson .
james .
charles .
okay , bring us up to speed on this .
another division mobilized north of the dmz .
80, 000 troops and counting .
and another million in reserve .
moon's father won't allow a war .
general moon's under arrest .
hard liners staged a coup .
general moon's under arrest .
hard liners staged a coup .
you deliberately misled me by implicating bond .
lf you'd told us about your agent ...
she'd be dead .
your mole would've made sure .
we wouldn't have a mole ... ... if you'd told us that frost and moon were on the harvard fencing team together .
knowing who to trust is everything in this business .
well , well , james bond .
just in time for the fireworks .
let's get down to business .
we're at defcon 2 .
and if the north goes south , they're gonna go south big time .
you don't just stroll through a minefield .
you need some kind of an edge .
icarus .
we're taking care of that ... ... with an asat launch in one hour .
where's graves?
in a north korean air base .
they're right where we can't touch him .
you can't ... ... but i can .
look ... ... we're here in case things escalate , not to make sure that they do .
no incursions into the north .
president gave me a direct order .
and when did that ever stop you?
you make your own decision .
i'm sending in 007 .
you think i'd leave this in the hands of the british?
you think i'd leave this in the hands of the british?
you go with him .
approaching drop zone .
okay , let's go !
they've entered north korean airspace .
relax , robinson .
if our radar can't see those switchblades , the north koreans sure as hell can't .
hey , boss , they launched against icarus .
leave it on automatic .
i hope nobody here is superstitious .
that's one big mirror we're about to break .
oh , my god .
mobilize the south korean troops .
and get me the president , now !
still no news of bond?
vehicles .
some big shots .
it's him .
three hundred meters .
windage , one and a half .
we gotta get on that plane .
you , have my father brought down .
father ... ... i regret our meeting had to be like this .
you can't tell it's me?
i don't know you .
you've always found it difficult to accept me .
that made my exile easier to bear ... ... but i never forgot what you taught me .
in war , the victorious strategist only seeks battle ... ... after the victory has been won .
you see , father , i remember my art of war ... ... and this is what guarantees that victory .
my son ...
what have you done to yourself?
come , father .
watch the rising of your son .
the second that hits the 38th parallel ... ... hit them with everything we got .
that may not be enough .
do you see , father?
do you see , father?
icarus is clearing the minefield ... ... creating a highway for our troops .
if the americans don't run , icarus will destroy them .
japan is a bug waiting to be squashed ... ... and the west will shake with fear .
but the americans will send nuclear warheads .
icarus will swat them from the sky .
you will destroy us .
you would kill your own son?
the son i knew died long ago .
father ... you disappoint me .
caution .
caution .
manual .
up !
manual .
up !
up !
caution .
manual .
come on !
okay , guys .
okay .
i got it .
my , my .
you get around .
let's see your gun .
left hand .
that's it .
that's it .
now drop it .
looks like your friends have bailed .
push on autopilot .
come on .
that's it .
good girl .
well , drowning you didn't seem to work .
i'll have to try something more to the point .
one thousand meters and closing .
i can read your every move .
read this .
bitch .
look , parachutes for the both of us .
not anymore .
you see , mr. bond , you can't kill my dreams .
but my dreams can kill you .
time to face destiny .
time to face gravity .
i think i broke her heart .
looks like we're going down together .
not yet .
get the back open .
okay .
come on !
come on .
i told you i was a jinx .
i should have warned you ... ... my relationships don't last either .
at least we're gonna die rich .
come on .
come on , come on .
come on .
come on .
now ... ... you said something about going down together?
james .
james .
moneypenny .
oh , james .
moneypenny?
moneypenny?
i was just testing it out .
it's rather hard , isn't it?
yes .
very .
wait , don't pull it out .
i'm not finished with it yet .
see?
it's a perfect fit .
leave it in .
it's gotta come out sooner or later .
no , leave it in , please .
few more minutes?
we really have to get these back .
still the good guys , huh?
i'm still not quite sure how good you are .
i am so good .
especially when you're bad .
