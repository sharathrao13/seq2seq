jackie chan , one of our best agents in hong kong is also missing in the african action
the three men they hijacked are the scientists responsible for the comet research project recently launched by the african state
lights !
we have a serious situation on our hands
the operation was carried out with clinical precision using united states air force helicopters
they seized the meteorite fragments along with the three scientists and untill now their whereabouts are unknown
if they knew the transport schedule someone must have leaked the information
how many c. i. a. staff knew about this project?
i know where you're heading with this , norman , and i don't like it
how can you be so sure it wasn't one of your own people?
why the hell would my guys break into a hangar they already have access to and steal their own aircraft?
because it's a perfect cover and no one would suspect them
and remember , general
the c. i. a. pulled out of south africa over a year ago
only the essential staff remain
right now , our first concern should be the retrieval of the scientists and the fragments
agreed .
there could be serious military ramifications if the wrong people get a hold of this formula
we've got to find out who's behind this pulling the strings
agent morgan
yes , sir
you used to head up our south african operation
you know the terrain , you know the locals
take 3 agents and hop the next flight over there
i want to see positive results .
and fast
consider it done , sir
thank you , terry
bye
general sharman
hello , norman
i hear you're retiring a few days
yes , i am
congratulations on your retirement , general sharman
thank you
i bet you're going to miss being in the middle of all the action
norman , i'm going to take that fat pension check of mine and head for my favorite fishing hole
i want a black op assigned to this case
are you saying we can't trust our own people?
better safe than sorry
shall i select them from washington or from one of the outside branches?
outside
sir , mr. white is here
thank you .
send him in
and tell them to report to me directly

28th of march , you and your group spent the night in this deserted exhibition hall
on the 29th , your friends disappeared
on 30 march , 3 very important scientists from my country were kidnapped and their whereabouts is still a mystery where have you taken them?
now listen , my friend
we witnessed five guys and the scientists at the power station
then , mysteriously it blew up
now if you're not a terroist , why the hell did you blow it up?
who are you working for?
i don't know
now on the day that our scientists were kidnapped
we discovered extremely high tech ,
lethal weaponry
the likes of which we've never been seen in africa
now only a first world country has got the money and the technology to make something like that
so , i want to know from you , my friend , who are you working for?
the japanese , the chinese , or the americans?
or maybe somebody else?
and telleleven done one too many .

we know about your special training
but we've got special ways to make tough guys like you crack
i'm waiting
i told you , it's no use

on terrorism , espionage and attempted murder
if any of his friends arrive , i'd like to have a little chat with them
let's go , smart ass !
what's happening in here?
you idiots !
he was handcuffed !

so why are those guys after you?
everybody's after me
c. i. a. , secret police , even you
you must be hiding something
hiding what?
you must have stolen something from them .
where is it?
where is what?
i don't know !
try to remember
how did you do that so quick?
all i remember is i've got 6 passports
6 passports?
no fingerprints?
amazing !
but this is not you .
who is this?
i got it from the dead body
dead body?
what a great story !
christine
it's not a story !
eleven done one too many .
what does this mean?
it's a puzzle .
eleven done one too many
you remember something , don't you?
tell me !
i used to be good at that
someone bring my memory back
what are you doing?
i'm trying to help him !
don't you remember?
the doctor said it would help
i told you !
never do that again !
ok
who am i?
we ran into a slight snag .
we lost him
i suggest you find him .
quickly !
he's lost his memory .
what harm can he do us?
you ever heard of short term amnesia , you idiot?
what do you want me to do?
what you were supposed to do in the first place .
kill him !
right
africa's a bit bigger than washington
are you sure you want a piece?
very juicy
guys !
i've broken the code !
it's a phone number .
a company in rotterdam !
rotterdam?
yeah !
how do you know?
eleven deleven done one too many .
the letters stand for numbers on a phone key pad
the first number is the international code , zero eleven then the country and city codes .
don't you see?
done is d one , right?
so look , d is three and one is one 31 , the netherlands !
okay
the company's name is heinex holdings
but all i got was their answering machine
sounds great !
but i still don't get it
where did you learn to break codes like that?
spy novels .
i'm addicted to them
they could know my past .
i have to go there
you mean we have to go there?
you promised me a story , remember?
besides , the newspaper will pay our expenses
okay .
but you go at your own risk
it sounds so exciting .
i wish i could come with you
hey , let's take a picture for my african scrapbook
no !
what's wrong?
something wrong?
i tried to scare him , just like you did
that was a good one !
i got you
did it work?
anyway , this one's out of film .
let's try the other one
forget it .
yuki , thank you very much .
we'll keep in touch
say goodbye to your brother
let's go
where are you headed?
airport
you're going to walk?
i'll drive !
good idea
what's wrong with my driving?
rotterdam , holland
this is the place
the encoded phone number belongs to that building over there
did you talk to anybody?
yes who?
the operator
then what?
i just hung up
you hung up?
who am i supposed to talk to?
there must be over a hundred companies in there
the number is right
the matches from the dead body are also from this restaurant
he must have been here
that's obvious .
so what do we do now?
shall we just walk in and take a look?
i don't think so .
the place is heavily guarded
even the police would have a hard time getting in there
where are you going?
i've got to make a phone call
here .
use mine
no .
i'll use the pay phone .
reception's better
mr. morgan

what kind of reporter uses this?
the best !
i'll do anything to get the story !
anything?
yes .
anything
quick !
look , i'm sorry .
i shouldn't have done that .
i crossed the line
but i'm not the one you should be worrying about
maybe your friend on the phone is lying to you
no .
he's c. i. a.
every organization has people on the take
look , i didn't mean to offend you
here .
you can have the tape
let me explain !
this is a gun !
you're not a reporter !
now i know how you broke the code so easily
and opened the handcuffs !
who are you?
what do you want?
listen to me !
who are you?
all right
i haven't been totally honest with you , but it was for your own protection
i'm with the c. i. a.
now you're c. i. a.
yes , but i'm on your side !
nobody's on my side !
you call anybody in the bathroom?
who were you calling?
what are you talking about?
you set me up !
you , round the back !
i've got him !
come here to help !
think you can get away?
excuse me
hey , what do you think you're doing?
what's going on here?
mind your own business !
hey , you can't do that !
feels good?
get him !
stop !
don't move !
don't shoot !
here , sweetie
donation , save the children fund
mr. morgan?
who am i?
you're right .
someone's after me
my men couldn't find you at the coffee shop
what happened?
i had to leave .
where are you?
i'm on my way to rotterdam
you stay put .
where are you?
how long till you get here?
3 to 4 hours .
i'll commandeer a military jet
where are you?
i'll call you then
so why don't we just kill him?
because we still don't know what he's found out
the buyer's coming this afternoon
when the transaction's complete , we'll have nothing to fear from him
you take care of the three einsteins upstairs
when the deal's history , so are they
i want that lab pristine
and no evidence left in the building
it's being dealt with
hey , mr. armano
hey , nice joint you got here
i'm getting to like rotterdam
i see the general's got security nice and tight
yeah .
and he's been expecting you
oh , sorry !
over here .
this entry point .
and here
i want 24 hours surveillance .
effective immediately
yes , madam
what are you doing?
so that happened to the power station
that rock is really something
now that's what i call quality advertising
can you imagine the amount of energy produced by these fragments?
my client prefers reality to imagination
that's why we're not giving you all the money up front
but i would say that half a billion dollars is more than enough motivation for you to deliver a quality product
mr. nelson is not giving charity
believe me , he's getting a bargain
he's only paid one third of the cost of the research project in south africa and he's getting a complete product
they're bringing the scientists and the merchandise right up
bring in another pot of hot coffee
so you take 20 % on the deal , armano?
frank , i'm just a poor boy trying to make a living
this disc contains the only remaining information about the formula
the rest of the research files have been completely deleted
and keep in mind that we still do not have all the knowledge to control the energy expansion completely
yes , sir .
that's a problem
we need more time to solve this problem
once we solve it the energy could be used for a positive purpose
he's right
that's very considerate , gentlemen but we had something a little bit different in mind
can you imagine , an ordinary machine gun with the destructive force of a ballistic missile?
you promise us that you should not use the formula for destruction
we've already spoken about your daughter , manfred !
wait a minute !
and now , you sell it to arms dealers .
yes .
that's it !
take these gentlemen away
seems they've overexerted themselves
this mr. nelson of yours is not only a very astute man but he's also going to be very rich because everybody's going top want this weaponry
can you believe this little piece of plastic costs billions of dollars?
champagne is ready outside , sir
why don't you take our friend here with you and show him our hospitality
yes , sir
it's so hard to find a good help you can trust these days
yes
six , seven , eight zeros
don't make a mistake .
one zero makes a hell of a lot of difference
i don't play around when it comes to money
you know when i press this enter , all that money's going to be yours
let me
your request is being processed .
please wait .
look at this .
they call this swift banking and i still got to wait
come on !
calm down !
you waited this long , what's a few minutes?
i need a drink
i'm the one who should be worried about this
general
i still think there's too many people that know about this
what do you think?
relax !
the commandos involved in the mission all met with a tragic accident
oh yeah?
well according to my sources , there was one survivor
he doesn't even know who he is
and by tomorrow , he won't exist
and our three learned gentlemen will be disposed of along with their lab
well , why wait?
we got the disc .
why not do it right now?
yung , take care of the three gentlemen
yes , sir
your statement worries me a little
what?
am i going to be the next to go?
that's right .
you did send me the five hundred million dollars , didn't you?
i'm joking .
i was kidding .
we're friends , armano
now look !
friendship !
friendship !
save the children fund
coffee?

your men found me at the coffee shop

it's got a microchip in it
it gives your location every time you use it
they tried to kill me !
they weren't my men
by the time my men got there , you were gone
sharman must be tapping my phone !
look , if i'd wanted to kill you
i could have done that in south africa
sharman must have sent the hit men after you in johannesburg
but don't worry , we'll take care of them
look , i know you're confused
you don't know who to trust
like i said before , don't trust anyone
you've got the disc .
