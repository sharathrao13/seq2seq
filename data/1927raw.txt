i worked in a storage facility in saigon .
i thought it was a crate of beer .
turned out to be explosives .
you still alive .
that's what they said .
one minute i'm in saigon , the next i'm in a hospital in maryland ... and six months had passed .
i woke up , couldn't see .
didn't know where i was .
some assholes tell me i'm lucky .
hey , binh !

never saw her again .
it's like i told you , one minute i'm in saigon , and boom , i'm stateside .
so one day you were there , and then you were gone ... just like that?
just like that .
and then the war was over .
nobody could go back .
never saw her again .
simple as that .
first time i saw my wife , she was standing on a street corner ... in a uniform , college uniform .
only i didn't know that's what it is .
i just thought it was one of your national costumes .
but it was white .
it had high slits up the side .
i'd never seen someone so beautiful before ... in all that ugliness .
then she rode away on her bicycle and i thought i'd never seen her again .
but i found she worked after school in her uncle's barbershop .
she was a terrible barber .
big feet .
dirty , too .
we had a boy .
he was just a baby .
he had the eyes of an old man , even at two months .
or maybe they all droop , we didn't know .
why you no go back?
go back?
see the old sights?
no , i left her to take care of the child alone .
i didn't think that she needed a blind man to look after .
my mother is very beautiful ...
like crane flying at sunset .
binh , why are you here?
this place?
no , america .
america beautiful .
