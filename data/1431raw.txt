don't get me wrong .
i love the 49ers !
montana and rice?
they're hall of famelocks , baby .
but do they cover the spread?
hell no .
not like the giants .
let me tell you something .
you can give me simms and bavaro , meggett and l. t. any day .
those guys are your meat and potatoes .
they fucking cover , baby .
and don't even bring up miami .
don't .
cause there's nothing in miami .
miami has nothing but marino with a golden arm and some fat booty cheerleaders .
they have no running game .
it s like two virgins who can't find the dam hole .
that's why they get blitzed all the damn time .
you understand?
i can't believe you guys , man .
yeah , they put up a ton of points , but they cover every other week .
so take the over and bet the fucking farm .
you understand?
the pigs , the barn , the little chickens and that tractor .
bet all of that .
dallas , america s team , my sweet black ass .
come on .
try to book
everybody and their grandmother wanna bet the cowboys .
therefore they gotta win by two touchdowns just to cover .
and what are the odds on that happening?
so dome a favor .
take the points and run .
come on , guys .
allright?
unless you are a moron , retarded saints fan .
therefore you deserve to get cornholed on the 50 yard line .
america's sport , baby football .

let s see that ten million dollar red beauty , baby !
fucking right .
the surgeon general was right !
cigarettes can kill !

the psychodynamics of compulsive stealing are well established .
an act committed to relieve a pre existing state of guilt .
an attempt to harm an imagined enemy or a form of revenge ...
against those who have deprived the person of something significant ... or somehow inficted a narcissistic injury .
but stealing panties from the girls 'locker room , there s nothing in there .
i've never really been a big fan of freud's anyway .
i don't know if i should say this , i'm a professional .
i won't say anything .
you promise to keep your word?
okay .
you know that thing that you were doing with the panties?
everybody does it .
your best friends do it .
the mailman , the headmaster .
they all whack off .
and if anybody tells you they don't , they're lying .
my momsays i'm
she says i'm oversexed .
now you're dead !
hello?
hi , daddy .
hello .
excuse me .
who am i speaking to?
this is me .
no , my jessie is eight .
the girl i'm talking to is at least 11 .
can i speak to your mother , please?
mom .
don't forget the turkey .
why don t you have them deliver it?
it's thanks giving eve , nathan .
you might as well get the bird to fly here .
all right , okay .
fairway , right?
what's the cross street , 74th?
the man's a steel trap .
i will be there in ten minutes .
bye .
go away .
come on .
shit !
louis?
this better be a real emergency .
ah , my hero !
look .
she's not one of your dalton trust fund waifs , but she needs your help .
i don't know .
i don't talk to you for days .
then the night before thanks giving
jesus christ .
lucky guy's still alive .
she took a razor to this orderly up in rockland . 111 stitches to close him up .
what was the trigger? good question .
been in and out of institutions for ten years .
i see that .
selective mutism , obsessive compulsive behavior , post traumatic symptoms .
twenty different hospitalizations , twenty different diagnoses .
plus an i. q off the charts .
apparently saw her father killed by a subway when she was eight .
dr. sachs?
what?
the girl who was biting the heads off pigeons , she has a med student in a headlock .
call security .
make sure the student documents the attack and gets it co signed .
louis , i don't know what the hell you want from me .
i got a family home waiting .
nathan , spend 15 minutes with her .
she's an 18 year old girl , never hurt a fly until last week .
you and i are the only thing that stands between her and a lifetime of thorazine or worse .
wait !
what do you mean , you and i , " kemo sabe?
she's your patient .
you're an asshole .
okay?
you're a big asshole for making me say this .
you're better at this stuff than i am , okay?
you're better , you're better .
everybody knows about nathan conrad and the famous touch with the teens .
elisabeth burrows .
this is the kind of case you and i used to live for !
before you went uptown on me .
just kidding .
i didn't mean it that way .
look .
she needs you .
all right , she needs me .
but what's the emergency?
why tonight?
if we don't make some progress by monday , they're gonna ship her to creedmore ... and chain her to a bed for the rest of her natural life .
that's why .
that's why she needs you now .
five minutes .
five minutes !
arnie , frankie , good evening .
dr. conrad , are you slumming tonight?
afraid so .
you guys up for a cavity search?
i'll pass .
but dr. sachs , he's always ready for one .
on the gate .
what's the new cocktail?
haldol , droperidol and ativan .
and she's awake?
oh , yes , she's awake .
he told me to stay .
come on , sweetheart .
is she eating?
not eating , drinking , sleeping , bathing , letting anybody touch her ... or saying a word .
dr. sachs , he told me to stay .
i'll have a word with him .
i promise , louise .
i promise .
what's with the heavy artillery?
well , it took about five guys to get her off the poor fellow at rockland .
is there anything else you want to tell me?
no .
no .
no .
would you open the door , please?
are you okay?
am i okay?
yeah .
i'm okay .
hello .
elisabeth , my name is dr. conrad .
i'm a psychiatrist .
word has it that you haven't eaten for days .
well , i can understand that .
i used to work in this hospital .
i know what the food's like .
elisabeth , would you mind if i took your pulse?
that means i'm gonna have to touch you .
now that's not supposed to happen .
true catatonics have what's called a waxy fexibility of their limbs .
that means they stay exactly where they're posed .
there's more to you than meets the eye , elisabeth .
you're very , very good at what you do .
so is there anything you want to talk about?
well , that's okay .
we hardly know each other .
i know you must have been very frightened to do what you did to that guy .
i know that you were angry , because i saw those photos .
but i also know that you re in a lot of pain .
because nobody's in this place without a reason .
so maybe we'll talk next week .
you want what they want .
don't you?
what who wants?
elisabeth , what who wants?
any of you .
any of you .
any of you .
h hello?
who are you?
five to three , this old bag doesn't have cable .
i need my sports center .
dinner's over !
how you doin ', tony?
good .
how you doin '?
nice to see you again .
you too .
hello !
this certainly looks like the conrad residence .
it smells like the conrad residence .
and it is definitely overheated ...
like the conrad residence .
but it doesn't sound like the conrad residence .
hi , honey .
i'm looking for a little girl ... about four feet two , light brown hair .
huh .
where did she go?
well , if i don't find that little girl ,
i'm gonna have to go downstairs and find myself another little girl .
i'll be back in ten minutes .
hi !
hi , daddy .
how are you?
look what i did in art class today .
that's beautiful .
look at the colors .
you got such a unique vision .
it's my vision , i swear .
aren't you supposed to be in bed?
i can't sleep .
i have mental problems .
i see .
what kind of mental problems?
i'm highly neurotic .
you've been in my study again .
i needed the stapler .
go say good night to mom .
you're late .
night , mommy .
night , baby .
did you brush your teeth?
can i smell?
yeah .
mmm , delicious .
i'm gonna put monkey by you on that side , and i'll put sally over here to keep you company .
you had a bad day .
why do you say that?
frown face !
if i had a frown face , it's because it's after 10 : 00 and you're still awake .
where were you tonight?
i was working .
why?
because i was helping a young girl .
all right , but that's gonna cost ya .
all right , what's it gonna be?
one hug ... two kisses .
two kisses?
boy , you cut a tough deal .
okay .
here's one hug .
mmmmm .
and one kiss .
and two kisses .
will they put bart simpson in the parade tomorrow?
they will put bart simpson in the parade if you go to sleep right now .
okay , but i don't think they'll care if i go to sleep or not .
good night , sweetheart .
i love you .
i love you too .
let me give you a hand , detective .
thanks .
that's beautiful .
what exactly is beautiful?
your jacket , the leatherjacket .
it s beautiful .
right .
did you read about the manhattan bridge?
no .
actually , it was builtwrong , moves ten feet .
but it's still standing .
syd simon .
i'll see you later .
detective cassidy .
what can i do for you?
what have we got?
floater , female , no i. d.
she's maybe in her 20s .
the sloughing of her skin tells me she's been in the water maybe two , three days .
this time of year with the water cold?
could be longer .
couple , three days tops .
her hands have been tied .
they recover any rope or anything?
they're still looking .
another body was found , a couple days ago .
battery park area .
yeah .
victim was male , middle aged .
day before yesterday .
all right .
i'm gonna need preliminary findings by tonight .
dream on , detective .
i got six , seven cases piled up .
syd , i got important doings planned for thanks giving .
do me right , all right?
tomorrow's the best i can do .
thank you .
first thing though .
cars have been towed , the roads plowed , so the annual turkey trot
you can't be distracted .
here you are .
immobile ,
totally exposed ... and quite vulnerable .
i think you need a bath .
guess what , sweetie?
what?
i already had a bath .
you did?
ah , well , you didn't have ... the nathan conrad fantastic special bath , did you?
no .
no , you didn't do that .
i didn't get that one yet .
pretty hot?
not too hot , is it?
no , it's nice .
oh , good .
i didn't know a thing about my legacy
when i feel like you were there for me
we should keep it down .
you're the one that makes the noise .
prepare to die of delight !
jessie , come on .
let's join the downhill racer .
i heard that about the " downhill racer .
you were dreaming .
i didn't say anything .
it was icy , you know?
i know it was , baby .
and very windy too .
it was a hell ride .
good morning .
morning .
you think she's still sleeping?
i don't know .
jessie?
jessie , come on .
the parade's gonna start soon .
all right , i'm gonna go there all by myself .
see all those foats alone .
jessie , come on .
breakfast is getting cold .
does she have a new hiding place that i don't know about?
probably .
she's been running around the house like a wildcat all week .
jessie , get in here right now !
honey , eat it up before it gets cold .
nathan , she wouldn't go out on the balcony , right?
she's not there .
she knows better than to go outside without asking us , doesn't she?
jessie , get in here right now !
you get outta here and go home and enjoy your thanks giving .
she lost one of her socks .
what?
she's gone .
what do you mean , she s gone "?
wait
what do you mean , she s gone "?
wait
somebody came in .
no , no .
she's in the hallway .
somebody took her .
nobody took her , nathan .
they broke in .
they cut the chain on the door .
what?
call the police !
i can't get a dial tone .
get off the line .
this is an emergency .
there's something wrong with the goddamn phone .
there is nothing wrong with the phone , nathan .
get off , this is an emergency .
i know .
who is this?
we have your daughter .
what  who is it?
what's your worst fear , nathan?
what are they saying?
the first shock can buckle the knees .
any truth in that?
where is she?
she's unharmed .
give it to me !
i don't want to have to hurt her .
i want something from you .
no .
what?
not until ...
i talk to my daughter , and i know she's okay .
you do not make demands .
you listen to what i tell you .
you call me back when i can talk to my daughter .
what are you doing?
aggie .
what the hell are you doing?
listen to me .
no !
are you crazy?
listen to me !
no !
no !
aggie , we have to make sure she's all right .
what if they don't call back?
hello?
daddy?
jessie , are you okay , sweetie?
honey , have they hurt you?
no .
daddy , can i come home now?
daddy !
jessie !
that was very brave , nathan .
tell me how much money you want !
i don't want your money .
pick up your wife before she breaks the other leg .
what?
nathan , what is it?
don't close the curtains .
i like the view .
good .
now .
on the bureau by the door is a cell phone .
i know what you're thinking .
don't .
by the time you hit the " 1 " in 911, jessie will be dead .
do not try to call or signal anyone .
if you do , i will kill your daughter .
not because i want to , but because those are the rules , do you understand?
yes .
what?
i can see you .
i can hear you .
when you leave your building , wherever you go , you will be watched .
so if you want to see your daughter alive , don't say a word .
now , tell me you understand .
i understand .
good .
you have a probono patient .
her name is elisabeth burrows .
a very disturbed girl .
she has a six digit number in her head , locked away in her troubled mind .
she guards it with her life .
what kind of number?
that needn't concern you right now .
i need that number .
you need your daughter back .
that is why this is happening .
you're a professional , nathan , so am i.
if we both do our jobs to the best of our abilities , by this time tomorrow , it will be like ... we never even knew each other .
now , go back to bridgeview .
take the rover .
no police , no detours .
and , nathan ,
aggie will be fine .
you have until 5 : 00 p . m . today .
let's do exactly what he says .
nathan , why don't we just call the police?
because we can't .
nathan !
because i believe him .
happy thanksgiving .
asshole .
hey , dr. conrad , aren't you and jessie hitting the parade?
she's got a cold .
no signs of sexual assault .
i see evidence of injury in her neck .
signs of bleeding in the strap muscles overlying her larynx .
i don't know , syd .
this girl does not match any of my missing persons .
also evidence of a fracture on the left tip of her hyoid bone .
syd , how'd she die?
no blunt instrument here .
her neck was snapped in two .
by what?
by two hands .
by two hands .
syd , the same technique used on this battery park foater?
same dislocation of the skull .
and the splotches on the body?
cigarette burns .
he was tortured .
thank you .
and he had prison tats .
okay .
i'm gonna need fingerprints and dental x rays on our jane doe , pronto .
you know , this is thanks giving .
you're right .
you are right .
all right , well , i hope her family isn't waiting on her to carve the turkey .
cassidy , i'm not susceptible to your " guilting me " bullshit .
she probably helped her mom with the dishes .
fingerprints and dentals .
then i'm the hell outta here .
thank you , syd .
whoa !
come on !
roll down your window , sir .
officer , i'm a doctor .
congratulations .
you happen to notice the tuba player that rolled off your hood?
i need to get through this parade .
i need an escort to the bridgeview psychiatric hospital right now .
do i look like a freaking helicopter?
use 57th street .
he's talking to the cops .
what'll we do?
be patient .
there's a young girl who could die , so , officer kreidman , you can either help me save this girl ... or not .
i need two guys .
the two of you .
let's go .
right over there .
come on , come on .
hold the band .
hold the band right there .
open those gates for me , guys .
son of a bitch .
he just picked up a police escort and cut through the parade .
i like that .
what?
the police escort .
i like it a lot .
you didn't tell me the context of the number .
she knows .
look , this girl has a decade of pathology to unravel .
even if she knows , your 5 : 00 deadline is absurd .
in my experience , people are at their best when facing unreasonable deadlines .
you can't just flick a switch in the girl's head .
you have to trust me .
it does not work that way in these cases .
look , the money's bad , i know .
but you have family obligations .
and , nathan , don't lose the phone .
the doctor has landed .
did he double alarm the car?
nope .
good .
we've got him focused .
do you have the key to dr. sachs's office?
yeah .
could you open it , please?
open it .
but dr. sachs isn't here .
i thought nathan explained the rules very clearly .
put the cell phone back .
there's no percentage in breaking those rules .
you sick son of a bitch !
you hurt my little girl and i'll
you'll do what?
you were about to say something personal .
i think .
no .
that's good .
if your husband is on his game today , you've got nothing to worry about .
there's a good side to this , aggie .
this will bring you ... much closer than the occasional ski trip ... or sponge bath .
the remote is to your left .
pick it up .
pick it up !
good .
now turn it on .
north carolinais tops
try hbo .
no , i've seen this .
bit too violent .
try a nice family drama .
nathan !
what are you doing here? you're not supposed to be here .
how'd you get in?
who let you in?
you're supposed to be in greenwich with kim and her family .
why are you here on thanks giving?
why am i here?
i gotta testify in a double homicide ... on monday , and i thought i'd come do research .
what?
you broke into my files !
those are my per i would've given you the key , man .
have you gone through all of this?
well , not all of it .
i just got here .
i've been through the master file .
it's a swamp of misdiagnoses .
i think she's overlaying .
overlaying?
louis , she is a brilliant mimic .
that's why rockland couldn't figure her out .
she's highly adaptive .
she takes on the symptoms of other patients .
she's like a counterfeit schizophrenic , maybe .
come on , i i can't believe it's all smoke and mirrors .
that would place her in the malingerer shall of fame .
i gotta believe there's some sort of genuine pathology beneath it all .
she has classic post traumatic stress symptoms .
her p. t. s. d. is real .
seeing her father die .
that was ground zero .
she also believes that something or somebody is after her .
and that is why she stayed institutionalized these past ten years .
she wants to stay inside .
so 20 different hospitalizations , twenty different diagnoses .
all overlaying .
nathan , that would make her a very , very talented young lady , wouldn't it?
or desperate .
louis?
yeah?
does anybody know i'm treating elisabeth burrows besides you?
everybody .
i put it up last night after you left .
figured you might be back .
i wanted you to have clearance in case i wasn't around .
also reinstated your password .
gate , please !
elisabeth , good morning .
feeling better?
i brought you something .
a chocolate turkey .
the sugar will help you metabolize all those meds they've been giving you .
you like thanks giving?
it's my favorite holiday .
wanna touch?
sorry?
i saw you looking .
i know what you're trying to do .
you want to embarrass me .
it won't work .
the other doctor?
dr. sachs .
yeah .
i don't like him .
well , i can understand that .
very fucking funny .
elisabeth , there's something important i have to ask you .
but first i want to show you something .
i have a daughter .
she's eight ... going on eighteen .
her name's jessie .
i have some of her favorite things here .
this is horton hearsa who .
i've read it to her so many times , it's pretty worn by now .
and this .
she loves to draw weird pictures of me .
and this
this is sally .
would you like one of those?
i'll make sure the hospital lets you keep it .
but you can only choose one .
what the hell is this , toys " r " us?
want me to choose for you?
choose 'fore you lose .
for you choose 'fore you lose for you
dr. conrad?
yes?
get out .
no .
i want you to leave .
we're not finished talking , elisabeth .
i know what you're trying to do .
you wanna embarrass me .
it won't work .
what's your name?
your hair's really long .
my hair used to be that long , but my mom made me cut it .
what's that thing on your neck?
it's kind of impolite not to answer someone's question .
it's a symbol .
what's it mean?
no talk .
elisabeth , there's something i need to know .
jessie .
jessie?
that's my little girl's name .
you wanna see a picture that jessie drew?
i'll make you a deal .
i'll show you the picture if you answer my question .
is it worth just one answer?
i don't mean a " yes " and " no " answer .
maybe .
i'm gonna ask my question now .
is the man that you hurt at rockland
did that have anything to do with the terrible thing ... that happened to you in the subway years ago?
run , honey , run !
shit !
run , honey , run !
i didn't know what you were talking about yesterday .
run !
i didn't know who they were or what they wanted .
leave !
now i do .
i know how bad they wanted it .
i know how important it was for you to hold onto it .
leave !
leave !
leave !
leave !
leave !
leave !
elisabeth
get out !
leave !
leave !
leave !
leave !
go !
thank you .
i'm sorry .
you lost her .
she's still got the doll , doesn't she?
yeah?
that went well .
look , i can gain her trust , but without more information ...
i'm shooting in the dark .
the answer's right in front of you .
i have gone through her files !
all right?
then look closer .
you  nathan ,
it's 12 : 22 .
i'm sure of one thing .
they would have encountered quite a few venomous species .
check this out .
see how he's got his tail up?
he is grumpy .
he gets his stinger back over the top of his head , ready to grab .
whack !
sting !
signora conrad?
sofia .
sofia , why are you here?
si, laporta .
i broke it .
mr. conrad will fix it .
what?
what?
il tacchino .
no , no , no .
no tacchino .
no telefono !
no !
just give it to me .
excuse me .
dammelo .
grazie .
hello .
signora?
get rid of her .
sofia , uh , no tacchino .
oh .
si .
grazie .
arrivederci .
any more visitors?
no .
oh , come on , yeah .
come on , baby , take it off .
come on .
all right , suit yourself .
i have to go .
you have to call me back .
you seen this?
what's this?
girl found wandering on hart island .
where'd you find this?
in her file in your office .
a young girl was found yesterday among the coffins on hart island .
this is around the time that her father died .
i should run this by child services .
could she have been lost or unattended?
what that's very bizarre .
on an island in the east river .
i saw sara two days ago .
she was meeting her boyfriend in the village .
maybe she's still with him .
she could be .
wait one second .
hey , jake .
uh , tray 57, and just her face .
thanks .
yeah , okay .
come on .
it stinks in here .
it smells weird .
i know .
just breathe through your mouth .
i've never seen anyone dead before .
you'll do fine , okay?
i'm gonna get sick .
listen , no one in here is gonna mind .
okay?
come on .
uh , listen , i've gotta take this .
but i'm gonna be right here .
okay?
cassidy .
oh .
hey , baby .
yeah .
uh , no .
you should take the 1 : 00 because i
i'll beat penn station by 2 : 00 .
make it 7 : 00 .
i promise .
don't promise .
what?
yeah , i'm almost done here .
yeah .
i'm at the city morgue .
bye .
mmm .
that's your n. c. i. c. on the guy with the busted neck .
oh , i got a hit .
leon edwards croft .
jesus , what does he have, 15, 20 arrests?
well , he's a busy little bad guy .
won't be missed .
you run him for known associates?
of course .
am i not a paid professional?
it's okay
why would someone do this to sara?
the guy with the cigarette burns , croft , he was the driver for this crew .
robbery said they hit banks here , jersey , delaware , virginia .
no convictions till '91 .
and , three of his friends just capped off a ten year jolt in attica .
patrick barry koster .
he's the last one that got out .
november 4 .
on november 4 !
did croft rat these guys out?
i don't know .
could be payback .
he has no priors .
there is nothing on him .
he came out of nowhere .
there's nothing .
it's the only thing he ever got popped for .
guy's a ghost .
he's a ghost?
well , i guess that's who i need to talk to , then .
thank you .
watch your back .
yeah .
well , you picked jessie's absolutely favorite thing .
