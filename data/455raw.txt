i love you .
good afternoon , mrs. phillips .
nice of you tojoin us .
are you aware that your security company's deadline for getting my bank online ... was 23 hours ago?
uh , mr. brisbane ...
i did inform you that , due to the age of the building ...
the primary shareholders will be here for the opening of the bank ... next friday night .
as i have said , the system will not have been tested , and i cannot , in good conscience ...
that party will take place , mrs. phillips , with or without your consent .
this is one of the most complex installs ...
hartmann , don't tell me how to run my bank .
all right?
you work for me .
remember?
now , when i turn around ... both of you will be gone .
and the race is underway . !
lap masters , secure the roadway .
number 16 ...
number 11 , bad chad , is into the pits ...
as we go into turn number one .
hey , retard , i'm losing the race ...
'cause you don't know what you're doing !
i can't believe mom made me hire you as my lead mechanic .
damn . !
done !
you'd better pray this works .
number 11 , bad chad , is finally out of the pits .
come on , man .
come on .
come on .
chris the clutch pulling tight , giving bad chad reason to worry .
looks like that front end may have gone out . !
number 11 , bad chad , is out of the race .
good job , dorkus !
dumb , stupid ...
gus !
he's got his own problems .
his crews are out there cleaning up .
we got ourselves a yellow flag .

my leading lady , my star .

maddy !
maddy . !

cut it out !
aah !
not so tight !

hi .
oh , come on !
why don't you pick on someone your own size?

loser number three .
look , i'm having a barbecue at my house , if you guys wanna come over .
definitely .
definitely .
hey , i don't know if you heard ... but bad chad picked up a shift at your mama's bank .
i'll be working with lieutenant ferrell in security .
one step closer to being a cop .
don't worry .
ferrell won't let bad chad carry a weapon .
he's an intern !
trainee , butt munch !
sorry .
he's training to be a butt munch .
doing a good job , too !
i'm gonna brain you . !
get over here . !
i'm gonna tell mom . !
you are so dead . !
when i catch you , i'm gonna give you a purple nurple ...
so immature !
isn't he?
okay , folks , race number three will start in five minutes .
so let's get ready to ... step on the gas and let's kick some ... butt !
it's race time !
butt "?
butt " what?
hi , dad .
hey , kiddo .
what's up?
mom needs me to pick up max from day care again .
it won't be forever , sweetie .
all right , now you sound like mom .
that's so terrible?
you okay?
is this a new style that the kids are sporting?
dad , don't freak out .
when do i ever freak out , madeline?
it's just that there are a thousand other sports ...
that don't involve falling a hundred feet to your death .
dad , you said standing on top of mount everest was the best day of your life .
no , i said it was one of the best days of my life .
look .
see , i even wore the hat you gave me .
i just don't understand what the problem is with me trying to be like you .
do we have to discuss this every day?
just till i turn 18 .
okay , race fans , here we are .
the last race of the day !
drivers , get in position .
hey , mr. p , can i ask you a very serious question?
only if you want a very serious answer .
do ladies like guys who build stuff with their hands?
or do they go for the nerds who play computer games and stuff?
yo , what he means is ... do women prefer a low i. q.?
ber male ... who only knows stuff about spark plugs ... or do they prefer a true artist ... who has both sensitivity and a brain?
that's a very difficult question , boys ... but i'm afraid i'm not the one to ask .
hey , madeline rose ...
no , no , no , no , no !
dad , don't call me that .
what are you doing?
nothing .
nothing .
nothing .
ow , ow , ow !
ow !
aah !
aah !
ow , ow , ow , ow , ow , ow !
it's an old climber's trick .
dude , you're gonna have a scar .
why do you get all the cool stuff?
it's true .
women love scars .
this drives maddy's mom crazy .
check it out .
whoa !
that's gross !
you can touch it if you want .
is that from when you fell?
yep .
hundred foot free fall .
okay , okay .
okay .
stop touching .
bad touch .
okay .
hey , stranger .
not you too .
now , this ... is a nutritious dinner .
please .
don't give me a hard time .
we just miss you .
especially maddy .
and i don't wanna have to set my alarm for the middle of the night ... just so i can have a date with my wife .
would you like to go dancing?
i have to go back to work .
i can't ...
i really ...
you have to do this first , okay?
tom , come on .
quit messing around .
i can't hold you up .
i can't ...
tom?
what's going on?
i can't feel my legs .
what ...
where does it hurt?
tom?
can you hear me?
tom?
tom . !
the injury probably occurred during his climbing accident .
there must be something you can do .
i mean , isn't there any kind of emergency surgery or anything?
there's nothing we can do here .
there is a private medical facility in denmark that has done testing on this injury .
okay , then let's go , then .
it's considered experimental .
even though it's been highly successful ...
we'll try anything .
your insurance won't cover it .
how much?
what?
how much does the surgery cost?
we'll pay for it .
two hundred and fifty thousand dollars .
okay , w we'll pay it .
mom , tell ...
mom , tell her we'll pay it .
mom , we ... we can ... we can pay it .
mom , tell her we'll pay it .
please .
two hundred and fifty thousand dollars?
please tell her we'll pay it .
what happens if your dad doesn't get the operation?
we'll go door to door .
everyone loves your dad .
they'll give us money .
i could sell my camera .
it's $250, 000, you guys .
you know how much money that is?
i have a coin collection .
they're rare .
r ...
well , what if i ... what if i borrow half?
and then i can make ...
no , it doesn't exceed that .
personal collateral?
uh , we own a go cart track .
let's cut to the chase , shall we , mrs. phillips?
you're not qualified for a personal loan of this size .
i understand , but , uh , my husband is sick and i was hoping ...
yes .
yes , i'm aware of that , mrs. phillips .
doesn't it mean anything that i work for the bank?
but you're freelance , aren't you?
mm hmm .
from a security company .
a security company which , under your guidance ... has been unable to provide my bank ... with a fully operational security system in the allotted time ... stated in the contract .
come on .
come on , sweetie .
don't you have a heart?
this is not an emotional issue , mrs. phillips .
a bank has no heart .
only paper in a vault .
strange not being able to move .
i've been staring at the same spot on the ceiling for the past three hours .
mom can't come up with the money , dad .
i escaped death on that climb , maddy .
twenty feet from the summit , my gear stuck ... but there was this perfect crack all the way up to the top .
you free climbed it?
it was so easy , i lost concentration and i fell .
but somebody or something was looking out for me so i could go home ... see you , get to know what a great girl you are .
in a way , that fall was the best thing that could've happened to me .
you know i'd do anything for you .
dad , we'll come up with the money .
i promise .
and lined it with a 200 foot high steel chamber ... which houses the lion safe .
the system combines the best of new technology ... and old tried and true security methods ... making harderbach financial the most secure a bank can be .
the entire system is run on a tri motor generator ... making power loss a virtual impossibility ... meaning the system will remain safe even in the event of a citywide blackout .
the project began in the fall of 2000 ... and is the largest , most technologically advanced security install to date ... for any bank in north america .
the halls are lined with hundreds of motion sensitive cameras ... whose images are fed back to a state of the art security booth .
until the system has been fully tested ... the halls will be patrolled after hours by highly trained attack dogs .
this all leads to the lion safe .
the safe is suspended nearly 100 feet off the ground ... and is equipped to hold over $25 million in cash and gold bullion .
safety deposit boxes line the walls of this chamber .
slated to be finished in april of 2004 ...
are you crazy?
we can't rob a bank .
we'll pay them back .
how?
i don't know .
i'll work .
i'll do anything .
you understand what happens if we get caught , right?
we go to jail forever .
like , until we're 21 .
no one will ever suspect us .
adults treat us like we're five years old anyway .
how hard could it be?
tomorrow i'll go to work with my mom and check out the bank .
meanwhile , gus , you need to find out who the architect is of the bank ... and see if you can get a floor plan or a model .
and austin ...
austin'll take care of the dogs .
what dogs?
the rottweilers .
vicious killing dogs .
gus , come on .
this is serious .
tomorrow , at the bank , i'll try to check out my mom's security system .
good morning .
who's in the car with you today?
my daughter .
i'll take as many pictures as i can .
you guys , i really need you .
all right .
for mr. p.
for your dad .
okay , maddy , here we go .
maddy?
do you have any idea how fast you were goin '?
save it , pal .
license and registration .
that ... is the eye of god , chad .
do you see these people?
these are not people .
these are snakes in paradise , waiting for your weakest moment ... any chance you give them .
these people?
not to be trusted .
oh . !
my sweethearts .
maddy , i love that you wanted to come to work with me today , sweetheart ... but i have a lot of work to do , so i need you to keep up .
can i see the safe?
that's just the old safe .
the real one's upstairs .
what are those?
that's a motion detector .
can i see the new safe?
and if miss fancy pants phillips would have listened to me ... we wouldn't need all this high tech flim flammery .
the dogs ...
the dogs would have done all the work .
the dogs and my black belt , that is .
aaah !
back to the monitor , maggot !
your office is upstairs?
yeah .
i need to be near the safe .
whoa .
that thing looks like it's alive .
it's got a built in motion detector ...
the guards can't watch all 100 cameras at the same time ... so when the camera picks up movement , the light goes on and they can see us .
watch .
just stay completely still .
ah .
climber girl .
that's pretty cool .
they'd better fix the i. s. p. , because that whole side of the building is s. o. l.
molly?
oh .
i didn't think you were coming in today .
the party is friday , so i wanted to make sure the system is as close as possible .
yeah .
listen , i spoke with brisbane about the loan , and he just wouldn't budge .
i'm really sorry .
oh , god .
we'll have to figure out some other way .
would you like a tour?
oh , alan , that's really ...
yeah !
that'd be awesome .
well , great .
we'll start this way .
don't worry .
i'll take good care of her .
now , we're gonna begin ...
i paid that phone bill . !
i paid that phone bill last week . !
hi .
my name's austin ...
easy .
my name's austin , and , uh , i make movies .
director .
really?
how may i help you?
i got this dog for my birthday , and i was hoping i could use him as a stunt dog ...
what kind of dog do you have?
a budweiser?
rottweiler?
yeah .
i just happen to be a rottweiler expert .
there is a really nice boy here ... who's going to write an essay about the design of the ...
harderbach financial building ... and he needs a floor plan drawing that he can use ... as a visual aid for his essay .
are you freakin 'nuts?
you can't give bank floor plans to a kid !
you're just ...
normally he's very nice .
but it's a little more difficult with banks .
i mean , imagine if you were a bank robber ...
it's just that last time i got a " c " on my essay ... because i didn't have any visual aids .
and my stepdad , he ...
well , he gets a little ...
oh !
just stay here .
you can't see it now , but by the party we are hoping it's primo .
down here is the security room ... ultra high tech and cool .
your mom designed that too .
notice the key pads , which are designed to keep people out of the important areas of the bank .
who has the codes to all these?
oh , they're different from room to room .
but i have a code that is good for the whole building .
cool .
come on .
d e n i r o.
de niro .
oh , look at that view .
this is the coolest office in the building .
it belongs to the big cheese , mr. brisbane .
check this out .
huh?
huh?
and get this .
your mom has rigged it so you can control all the cameras from right here .
you talkin 'to me?
huh?
are you talkin 'to me?
it's de niro .
i still do some acting .
this bank manager thing is just temporary .
come on .
you try it .
i don't know what to say .
say anything .
hi .
disgusting .
good !
haah . !
ooh .
in this room there's a tunnel that leads to the safe .
i can only tell you a little bit about the safe .
only your mom understands the whole thing .
after all , she designed it .
oh !
no !
my god !
i can't wait until we get rid of these things .
they get me every time .
down . !
shh . !
rottweilers respond to german commands only !
ausfahrt , killer .
ausfahrt . !
say " ausfahrt , killer .

thank you .
they're gonna send out a search party for me if i don't get back to work .
can you find your way back to your mom's office?
yeah .
thanks , mr. hartmann .
okay .

we'll see you tomorrow .
mr. hartmann?
hmm?
i think you'd make a really good actor .
thanks .
the party's in two days .
that's when we'll hit the bank .
austin , how'd it go with the dogs?
the dogs are under control .
gus , the model looks pretty cool .
piece of cake .
i thought that secretary was gonna adopt me .
do you guys think we can do it?
do you really think we can get the money?
are you kidding?
of course .
yeah .
of course .
i mean , you're , like , the best climber in the whole state .
yeah , and austin's , like , some freak of nature computer genius .
yeah , and gus is ...
gus is disgusting .
austin , this should be exactly the height of the gate at the bank .
watch carefully , okay?
okay , austin , your turn .
the cart doesn't control you .
you control the cart .
go .
i got it !
whoa ...
hey !
whoa !
whoa !
yikes !

do you want a window or an aisle?
a hundred p. s. i. of pure nos .
okay , work for your daddy .
it worked !
i'm a genius !
but how am i gonna stop?
maybe i'm not a genius !
aaaaah !
mr. hartmann's a really nice guy .
do you have your script?
i'm the director .
i'm always prepared .
i'm always prepared .
austin , you just have to get him to say to turn the alarm ...
off .
i know , i know .
come on .
hurry up .
i'm coming .
wait for me !
take it easy .
take it easy . !
take it easy .
all right , here .
maddy's playing the girl who's home alone and scared of the dark .
you play her dad , who walks in just as the alarm blares .
wh wh what do i do for a living?
i'm glad you asked .
you work for a specialized branch of the c. i. a.
ohh , i like that .
i've always wanted to play an assassin .
well , here's your chance .
you are a c. i. a. assassin .
um , can i get a water , please?
can i talk to you for a second?
over here .
um , okay .
which is stronger ... hair ... or no hair?
l ...
i think hair .
okay .
six slick schick super shavers .
and we're ready .
okay , this is scene one , take one .
sound , speed and ... action .
dad , is that you?
hey , take it easy .
it's only me .
you were really good today , austin .
seriously .
really good .
i just try to stay out of the way of my actors and let the magic happen .
gus , what are you doing?
we have to go over the plan .
go over the plan with your boyfriend .
what are you talking about?
he's not my boyfriend .
oh , so you'd rather go out with gus .
i never said that ...
are all boys this stupid?
i don't wanna go out with either of you !
if we're so stupid , then why don't you just rob the bank yourself?
fine !
i will !
good luck rigging your go cart .
yeah , and have a good time hacking into the bank's computer by yourself .
this whole bank idea sucks !
dad , i have to talk to you .
i'm gonna steal $250, 000 from mom's bank .
i have to climb a hundred feet to get to the safe .
way higher than i've ever , ever climbed before .
and i have to lie to my two best friends to get 'em to do it with me .
well , maddy ... a hundred feet is too dangerous .
you know , that's how far i fell .
yeah , i know , dad .
plus , it's illegal to steal money .
you know mom'll get fired if anyone ever found out .
i thought about all that , but ... but wouldn't it be worth it if it means you could get better?
yeah , maddy ... it probably would be .
i've been thinking since yesterday , and ...
i love you .
here .
um , i have the other half .
please say all that again .
stop .
come on .
promise to help with the mission?
yeah .
just don't tell gus , 'cause we need him , and he wouldn't do it if he knew .
he'd be devastated .
what about austin?
you're much cuter .
i've actually liked you the whole time .
yes !
i knew it !
uh , here .
i have the other half .
promise to help with the mission?
okay .
cool .
okay , guys , let's go over the plan one last time .
so , i took maddy's pictures from the bank , the model that gus brought home ... and i scanned them into the computer .
using those elements , i created a digital blueprint of the building .
check it out .
voil?
whoa !
that is awesome !
i mean , it's okay ... if you like that kind of stuff .
wow .
here's where the party's gonna be .
it'll be mostly contained in the lobby of the bank .
it's gonna be pretty fancy , so we're gonna need to blend in .
security's on the second floor , so we'll have to get past your brother and ferrell ... to get to the elevator that accesses the ninth floor where the safe is .
okay , and austin , you'll hack into the bank's camera system from brisbane's office .
gus , were gonna make our way to the safe .
it's suspended a hundred feet off the ground ... so the only way to get to it is to climb .
wow .
maddy , are you sure you're gonna be able to make this climb?
i mean , it's double the size of the water tower .
you guys take care of your jobs .
i'll take care of mine .
they're gonna be doing a lot of tests on your father tonight at the hospital ... so i wanna be there for that .
i'm gonna need you to look after max while i'm gone .
mom , i can't .
i'm going out with gus and austin .
you never think about me .
if you're not gonna come to the hospital , then you're ...
mom , i can't , i ...
maddy .
you're gonna babysit max tonight .
okay?
that's it .
oh , one more thing .
i do think about you , madeline .
every day .
all the time .
nice bandana .
nice turtleneck .
what's he doing here?
i have to babysit him .
but he's gonna completely ruin everything we just worked for .
he hasn't made a sound his whole life .
i don't think he's gonna start now .
what if we mess up?
we're my dad's only chance .
i'm ready .
you ready?
let's hit it .
ooh !
gross !
mom , bart was taking a picture of his butt !
like i'm really gonna take a picture of my butt .
stop it , you two .
since it's just the four of us tonight , we're having dinner ...
at the rusty barnacle .
yay !
grab a burger and ...
only four of us?
who escaped?
you know , that part?
i was really , really proud of it .
aren't those marvelous?
please let me show you .
these are really quite extraordinary .
the lighting , in particular ...
well , you know ...
the , uh , uh ...
it's all clear .
here you go , maddy .
okay , when i get up there ...
i'll try to disable the motion sensors so you guys can just come up the stairs .
careful , maddy .
maddy !
camera !
careful .
i gotta get chad and ferrell out of that security booth .
don't worry .
we got it covered .
and strike , and strike , like a cobra !
aaah . !
haah !
hoo !
oh !
lieuten ...
ohh !
lesson one , chad .
never take your eyes off the enemy .
take this for a test drive .
dude , the way your feet smell , it's just ... it's not normal .
whoo !
god , gus !
oh , my god .
gotcha .
what's that?
motion detected , north staircase .
check the monitors .
check the monitors !
i don't see anything .
that's when your enemy is their most dangerous ... when you can't see them .
this is a test .
i just know it .
i'll go downstairs , make a round .
you stay here ... and take care of your ... privates .
you stay in this booth !
okay , it worked .
well , sort of ...
ferrell's gone .
but now bad chad's alone in the security booth .
just hold on .
we'll think of something .
i got it .
i'm gonna distract him .
when i give the signal , get into the elevator .
i'll meet you there .
hey , maddy , what's the signal?
maddy !
get away from chad !
he's a lunatic !
my brother's crazy .
he really thinks he's a cop .
this wasn't part of the plan .
maddy , don't go in there . !
hi .
what are you doing here?
i was at the party .
i was totally bored .
what are you doing?
just my job .
you look different .
why are you such a jerk to your brother all the time?
well ...
you know he completely idolizes you .
gus?
yeah .
to him , you're like yao ming or shaq .
well , which one?
there's a big difference .
yao ming .
definitely shaq .
you think?
yeah , i think so .
sweet .
he thinks you're gonna be a great cop .
he told me .
come downstairs with me .
the police chief is here to check on mom's security system .
you could show him how serious you are about yourjob .
ferrell told me not to leave the booth , but ...
i just came from the party .
don't worry .
he's not down there .
she winked at me .
so gus really thinks i'm cool?
yeah .
maybe that's the signal .
go .
where's the chief?
that's what i love about this ... the wave it sends through the body .
unbelievable .
oh , god .

backup requested .
harderbach robbery suspects on the loose .
alan !
i just heard .
how much did they get away with?
who's this?
uh , she's the head of security .
three suspects .
they got away on go carts .
they hit you for $250, 000 .
go carts?
yeah .
we also found this in the vault room .
they used it to climb up to the safe .
do you have the perpetrators in custody?
not yet .
what i want to know is , why would someone break into a safe with $25 million ... and steal only $250, 000?
excuse me !
there she is !
she's our so called head of security .
this is all her fault !
actually , mr. brisbane , i did ...
uh , mr. brisbane , with all due respect ...
molly did tell you that the security system had not been tested .
really?
well , you just got your walking papers .
didn't you , hartmann?
are you talkin 'to me?
are you talkin 'to me?
well , you must be talkin 'to me , 'cause there's nobody else here .
so you must be talkin 'to me !
excuse me .
monsieur nuffaut , i must apologize ... for this strange debacle .
i assure you ...
it's not me you owe an apology to , brisbane .
if the head of security told you ... the system is not ready , then it seems like a ... how do you say ... a knucklehead move to go ahead with this soiree .
je suis d?
sol?
madame .
the blame falls squarely on your shoulders .
on y va , ch?
rie .
monsieur nuffaut !
oh , fran?
ois !
couldn't stay away , huh?
let's go save your dad .
maddy , what are you doing?
i have the money for the operation , dad .
we're goin 'to denmark .
what are you talking about?
i got the money !
honey .
what have you done?
maddy , we gotta go !
what are you doing?
madeline , what ...
mom , i have ...
i have the money .
we can go .
molly , what is ... what is this?
i warned him ... that the system wasn't online yet .
i know .
and to prove to everyone ... just how vulnerable the bank was ...
i had my daughter and her two friends ... three kids ... rob the bank .
and i think if you look in my contract , you will see ... that i have a license to perform undisclosed tests to the system ... until such date as the system is deemed fully operable .
are you buying any of this?
yeah .
molly was authorized to hire consultants ... to test the system .
this was all a plan ... a brilliant plan .
all right .
could you step back , please?
mrs. phillips ...
mrs. phillips , is it true ... your daughter is a leading suspect in the robbery?
sir?
mrs. phillips , please?
ready?
we understand three children were involved in the high speed pursuit ... ending up here at community wide hospital .
details are sketchy , but it appears the children ... have robbed harderbach financial of nearly a quarter million ...
and a source inside the bank is saying the robbery ... was actually some type of plot to test the bank's security ...
now , stories are swirling , but this reporter has learned ... that one of the children has a father in desperate need of an operation .
the child has not been identified ... but her father is registered in the hospital as tom phillips .
now , mr. phillips runs a local go cart track , and is expected to return home tomorrow ...
since insurance will not cover his operation .
maddy?
i'm maria quiban , channel 10 news .
you know what you did was wrong .
yeah , i know .
and i know i haven't really been there for you .
but that's gonna change .
okay?
i love you .
i love you too , maddy .
you have such a big heart .
you guys gotta come down the track .
you're not gonna believe this .
they're coming .
what are they doing?
waiting to buy tickets .
come on .
let's go .
hey , maddy .
hey .

keep the change .
tell your dad to feel better .
thanks .
that's three dollars .
well , here's a hundred from my parents .
thank you .
wait .
here's your ticket .
six dollars .
here you go .
tell mr. p , " feel better .
ho ho .
how much?
400 .
i have 300 .
here's two here .
wait .
plus ...
well?
even with the donations from the news station , we're still short .
molly?
mr. hartmann .
you forgot something ... the consultant fee for the company you hired to pull off the robbery .
holy ... $50, 000?
ah .
the hair .
the hair .
well , that should get you pretty close .
and the president of the bank has authorized any personal loan to cover the difference .
mr. brisbane already said that ...
i'm afraid he's not with the bank anymore , so call me for whatever you need .
thank you so much .
you're welcome .
i finally got my starring role .
$50, 000 !
yes !
no .
