gone fishing .
the lonesome foghorn blows .
oh , dear .
lucy , this is pete martell .
lucy , put harry on the horn .
sheriff , it's pete martell up at the mill .
i'm going to transfer it to the phone on the table by the red chair .
the red chair against the wall .
the little table with the lamp on it , the lamp we moved from the corner .
the black phone , not the brown phone .
morning , pete .
harry .
she's dead .
wrapped in plastic .
hold on a second , pete .
where?
you stay right there .
i'm on my way .
better get dr hayward .
tell him to meet up at the packard mill .
roust andy out of bed .
tell him to get up there now .
what is it?
we've got a body up there .
lucy , not a word about this to anyone till you hear from me .
it's over here .
you want forensics first?
no , she's been in the water .
we'd better take some pictures .
who is she?
andy , the pictures .
sorry .
then we'll turn her over .
same thing as last year in mr blodgett's barn .
give me the camera .
sorry .
is this going to happen every damn time?
i'm sorry .
i'm so sorry .
why don't you go up to the coroner's van and bring back that stretcher?
ok .
sorry .
harry , let's roll her over .
good lord , laura !
laura palmer .
laura , sweetheart , i'm not going to tell you again .
yes , i am .
for goodness 'sake .
laura , now means now .
laura , honey , are you downstairs?
hello .
beth , it's sarah .
i just went up to wake laura and she's not here .
is she with bobby?
she could be .
he goes running at 5 : 00 am and then he goes to football practice .
can you find out?
can you reach him?
i'll call the school .
i've got the number of the field office here .
thanks , beth .
i wonder if she went out with leland?
he had an early meeting .
i'm sure that's it .
either that or she's with bobby .
sure .
i'll call up to the hotel .
thanks .
no , bobby hasn't shown up for practice yet today .
as a matter of fact , he's been late every day this week , mrs palmer .
and last week .
maybe even the week before .
are they ready to sign?
you're not going to mention that we haven't yet acquired access to the packard land?
sorry .
we have solid information that the packard sawmill is going to go belly up within a year .
we'll be able to get it for a song .
one verse , no chorus .
now ...
let's get out there and get those cheese eaters where they live .
benjamin .
... a clean , wholesome environment , much like your own .
with a quality of life to rival the very best that this country has to offer .
that is what the ghostwood country club and estates will be .
when i first spoke to sven , he was naturally very concerned about the quality of air here .
my air sacks have never felt so good !
your wife's on the phone again .
she said it's urgent .
excuse me a moment , gentlemen .
i'll be right back .
make it snappy .
so ... ... here in twin peaks , health and industry go hand in hand .
i'll transfer you to the house phone .
thank you .
sarah , what is it?
is laura with you?
no , why?
she didn't go with you this morning?
no .
honey , what's wrong?
what's this all about?
she wasn't here this morning .
she's probably with bobby .
i can't find bobby .
there you are .
that's it .
let's not worry .
they're probably together .
she would have left me a note .
she would have told me .
honey , take it easy , please .
i'm looking for leland palmer .
he's right over there on the phone .
sheriff truman .
what?
who?
what did you say?
oh , my god .
oh , my god !
leland , please .
what is it?
tell me .
leland ...
is this about laura?
i'm afraid it is .
leland , tell me .
my baby !
we're ready to go with the contracts .
leland , what's wrong?
my daughter's dead .
what kept you , heidi?
i couldn't get my car started .
too busy jump starting the old man?
i thought you germans were always on time .
i thought the only time you cared about , bobby , was making time .
you heading out , shelly?
yeah , i'm heading home .
i'm going to practice .
i can drop you on the way .
that would be great , thanks .
here's a tune for you , gals .
norma ... ... l'll see you in my dreams .
not if i see you first .
don't do anything i wouldn't do .
i think she knows about us .
norma?
fat chance .
i think she's hot to try for you herself .
it's happy hour in france .
come on , cowboy .
light your fire .
right , just a little pick me up before homeroom .
i thought i was your little pick me up .
baby , you are more like a three stage rocket .
a pocket rocket .
and what stage are we in now?
are you sure that your old man is still on the road?
yes , he called me last night from butte .
that's a long way away and he ain't got a phone in his truck .
quit worrying and start screwing , mr touchdown .
butte !
back up !
i'll call you later .
leland , i'm so sorry .
17 years old .
lee , i hate to put you through this .
no , i have to see her .
i have to see what was done to my little girl .
my baby !
that's my little girl .
god !
let's get out of here .
have you seen laura?
no , not yet .
nice day for a picnic .
bobby briggs , they're looking for you .
who is?
sheriff is .
well , here i am in school .
hey , snake .
something's up .
where?
you think i'm kidding?
what , me worried?
bobby , you're wanted in the office .
who wants me in the office?
right now , young man .
watch out .
terry franklin?
here .
martha grimes?
here .
donna hayward?
here .
audrey horne?
here .
james hurley?
excuse me .
room 106?
is there a bobby briggs in this classroom?
no , he's in 107 .
107 .
could i speak to you for a moment?
certainly .
... making the announcement .
thank you for your time .
there'll be an announcement from the principal .
i told you .
i got up early like i always do .
i went running like i always do .
i had breakfast at the rr and i didn't go to practice because i didn't feel like it .
why not , bobby?
were you upset about something?
you want to tell us about it?
look , you guys , what did i do?
what's going on?
mr wolchezk , there's rumours all over school .
maybe it's best if they heard it from you .
mr wolchezk , why don't you go ahead and make that announcement?
now?
now's the time .
excuse me .
what is it , sheriff?
what's going on?
bobby , you look at me .
your girlfriend laura palmer's been killed .
she was found just after dawn .
she was with you last night .
you weren't where you should have been this morning .
have these fellows advised you of your rights?
yes , but i didn't know why .
laura's dead?
yes .
did you understand your rights as they were explained to you?
you think i killed her?
bobby , you can phone your parents and they can arrange for a lawyer to be with you when we talk again .
andy , take bobby out to make his call .
i loved her .
and she loved me .
because i wasn't at football practice i killed my girlfriend?
you are crazy !
you get off me .
bobby , we're going to talk about this later .
may i have your attention , please .
this is principal wolchezk .
i am deeply saddened to have to tell you that early this morning your classmate laura palmer was found dead .
this is a terrible moment for all of us .
for all of us who knew her .
her friends , her family .
it is very important that we all try to help each other through this difficult time .
the police have asked me to ask each of you if you have any information about laura's activities after school yesterday or yesterday evening , please come forward .
i am dismissing all classes for the day , but before we leave i would like to ask each of you to join me in a moment of silence for laura and her dear memory .
you can talk to her now , harry .
do you know what time it was when you last saw laura , mrs palmer?
what time?
yes .
it would have been about nine .
yes , nine o'clock ...
... pm .
she came home from bobby's and she was going up the stairs .
those stairs ... right there .
who's upstairs?
your husband and one of my men .
i can tell from the sounds that it isn't her .
her diary .
do you know where the key to this is , sir?
do you have to take that?
we'll return it as soon as possible .
did she say anything to you?
no .
she said goodnight .
and i said , " goodnight .
goodnight , sweetheart .
mrs palmer , can you remember ...
did she make or receive any phone calls?
i heard her phone ring once .
about what time was that?
i don't know who it was .
harry .
that was lucy .
got a call from a guy who works at the mill , janek pulaski .
says his daughter didn't come home last night and she didn't show up at school today , either .
two by fours , four by eights .
two by fours , four by eights .
did you hear me?
you can't do that to my workers .
don't walk away from me .
come back here .
you're not going anywhere .
you're not going to tell anybody anything .
catherine ,
i'm sorry if this offends you , but i'm the owner of this sawmill .
you don't knowthe first thing about this mill .
that's why i'm running it .
i've never taken this authority before , but maybe i should have .
you're not shutting us down .
catherine , i have the final say so .
peter , push the plug .
pete , don't you dare .
catherine , please .
shorty , tell the boys to pull the plug .
that's right .
may i have your attention .
this is josie packard .
i have decided that in light of what has happened , all work here will stop .
bitch !
this morning , as you know , the body of miss laura palmer ...
what's your name?
fred truax e .
you're fired .
just now your co worker and a friend , mr janek pulaski , has learned that his daughter , one of laura's schoolmates , is missing since last night .
today all work here will stop .
the mill will shut down .
perhaps you can spend the day with your families .
thank you all for your attention .
what the hell?
laura's dead .
yeah , i heard .
she was the one .
buy you a coffee?
can't do it .
if you see donna , could you give this to her?
ed !
they said those drapes would be ready by 10 : 00 .
i want those drapes up by nightfall .
diane , 11 : 30 am , february 24th .
i'm entering the town of twin peaks .
five miles south of the canadian border , 12 miles west of the state line .
i've never seen so many trees in my life .
as wc fields would say , " i'd rather be here than philadelphia .
54 degrees on a slightly overcast day .
weatherman said rain .
if you get paid for being wrong 60/ of the time , it'd beat working !
mileage is 79, 345 .
gauge is on reserve .
got to tank up when i get into town .
remind me to tell you how much that is .
lunch was $6 and 31 cents at the lamplighter inn .
that's on highway 2 , near lewis fork .
that was a tuna fish sandwich , slice of cherry pie and a cup of coffee .
damn good food !
if you ever get up here , that cherry pie is worth a stop .
looks like i'll be meeting up with a ...
sheriff harry s truman .
shouldn't be too hard to remember .
he'll be at the calhoun memorial hospital .
guess we'll take a look at that girl who crawled down off the mountain .
i'm sure the sheriff can recommend a clean , reasonably priced motel .
that's what i need : a clean place , reasonably priced .
diane , i almost forgot .
i've got to find out what trees these are .
they're really something .
agent cooper?
yes .
sheriff harry s truman .
dale cooper , fbl .
pleasure .
good to meet you .
have any trouble finding the place?
no , no .
fine .
came out over highway 2 near lewis fork .
stopped at the lamplighter inn .
had a slice of cherry pie .
incredible .
i'll tell you , we're sure glad to have the fbi here .
kind of lucky in a way that ronnette stepped out across the state line .
whole town's badly shaken up .
sure , it's a nice quiet place .
sheriff , let me stop you for just a second .
there's a fewthings we've got to get straight .
it's best to talk about this up front .
when the bureau gets called in , the bureau's in charge .
you'll be working for me .
sometimes local law enforcement has a problem with that .
we're glad to have you here .
sheriff , what kind of fantastic trees have you got growing round here?
big , majestic ...
douglas firs .
douglas firs?
can someone get me a copy of the coroner's report on the dead girl?
the autopsy hasn't been done yet , but i'll take you down to the morgue when we're finished here .
fine .
dr shelvy , this is fbi agent cooper .
glad to know you .
doctor .
how's the girl?
she's in shock , suffering from exposure .
can i see her?
all right , this way .
was she raped?
several times .
one perpetrator?
we're waiting for the results .
is there any connection to the dead girl?
same high school .
as far as we know , they hardly knew each other .
no connection .
i'd like to question her .
this girl doesn't even know where she is or if she is .
what exactly are you saying?
we need a cat scan and we're not equipped for that here .
my opinion?
she may have neurological damage .
she's not responsive at all .
i'd like to examine her fingers .
all right .
they've already scraped for particles .
that's not what i'm looking for .
there's nothing here , not a thing .
don't go there .
don't go there .
ronnie?
ronnette?
pull the fish out of the water , big mouth .
he's got a big mouth that starts talking to me .
harry !
dr jacoby .
terrible , terrible tragedy .
yes .
this is special agent dale cooper .
gary cooper?
agent cooper .
agent?
fbl .
right .
dr lawrence jacoby , agent cooper .
laura was a patient of mine .
you're going to the morgue .
do you mind if i join you?
yes , i do .
why would you want to?
sort of against procedure , doctor .
no offence .
i thought i could be of some help .
you still could be ... at another time .
i understand completely .
by the way ...
laura's ... laura's parents .
they didn't know that she was seeing me .
that guy's a psychiatrist?
i have to apologise again for the fluorescent lights .
i think it's a bad transformer .
that's quite all right .
agent cooper , we scraped those nails when we brought her in .
there it is .
there it is .
my god , here it is !
what?
would you leave us , please?
jim .
would you leave us alone , please?
certainly .
i need something to grab onto this with .
diane , i'm at the twin peaks county morgue with the body of the victim .
laura palmer .
diane , it's the same thing .
i told you we'd see this again .
what have you got there?
ring finger , under the nail .
let's see what he left us .
it's an 'r '.
diane , give this to albert and his team .
don't go to sam .
albert has a bit more on the ball .
ok , cooper , are you going to let me in on what's going on here?
sheriff , we've got a lot to talk about .
hi , ed .
hey , donna .
i'm so sorry .
have you seen james yet?
he came by .
is he ok?
no .
do you know where he went?
i've already been to the roadhouse .
i don't know , honey .
he told me to give you this .
what the hell are you doing?
i've been looking all over for you .
bobby's in a lot of trouble .
he's my best friend .
we're going to the police station to be with him .
don't tell me where i ought to be !
second , laura was my best friend .
get in the car .
muffle it , junior .
mind your own business .
you're on my lot , friend .
ed , i'm not your friend .
donna , you get to the sheriff's right now .
i sure know howto pick them .
you waiting for those drapes to hang themselves?
i know howto pick them , too .
if james comes around , will you tell him i'm looking for him?
you bet .
and donna , you take it easy .
that's the videotape we just saw , the one we found in laura's bedroom .
at a certain point , i'm going to want to showthis to the boyfriend .
you say when .
did you complete your forensics?
you bet .
all done .
no key yet?
we're still looking .
why not?
diane , i've just opened laura palmer's diary .
this is the last entry , dated february 23rd .
asparagus for dinner again .
i hate asparagus .
does this mean i'll never grow up?
nervous about meeting 'j 'tonight .
that's the letter 'j ', diane .
and that is the last entry .
that's something to get started on .
yeah , that's one out of 26 .
one out of 26 .
diane , i've just turned back 18 days to day one .
taped to the page is a plastic envelope containing a white residue and a key to a safety deposit box .
sheriff , we have to very carefully remove this key .
we're going to run this envelope .
my bet is it will test positive for cocaine .
that's impossible .
you ever been surprised before?
mr cooper , you didn't know laura palmer .
let's get a court order to open the safety deposit box and maybe we'll both find out a fewthings about laura palmer .
diane , i'm holding a small box of chocolate bunnies .
lucy .
andy , is that you?
tell harry we found where ... it happened .
where ronnette and laura were taken and tortured .
tell harry ...
... i didn't cry .
andy , are you ok?
sweetie?
but , lucy ... ... it's so horrible .
andy , sweetie .
my god .
bobby , you have been advised of your constitutional rights .
am i correct?
yes .
bobby , did you kill laura palmer?
no !
she was studying at your house until about 9 : 30 last night?
yeah .
bobby .
yes , sir .
did she drive herself home?
yes .
you two had a big fight last week , didn't you?
so what?
if i had a fight with her , if i sang songs with her , if i went skipping rope with her , what difference does it make?
i didn't kill her .
bobby , here's howthis works : we ask the questions and you answer the questions that we ask , briefly and to the point .
did you shoot this video , bobby?
if you didn't , then who did?
did you know laura was seeing someone else?
that's what you fought about last week .
look at these pictures .
look how happy she is .
you ever do cocaine with laura , bobby?
i don't do drugs .
excuse me , what are you charging my client with?
that's right .
you're a football player , aren't you , bobby?
if you knew who she was seeing ... ... tell us .
ask donna , she was with her .
i'm asking you .
come on , bobby , give me a name .
here's a hint : first initial 'j '.
no ... ... she wouldn't do that to me .
you didn't love her anyway .
let him go .
julie , the norwegians are signing the contract at four o'clock .
when mr horne returns , make sure they do not hear about laura palmer's death .
that will blowthe whole deal .
got it?
thank you .
ok , bob .
ok , bob .
julie , what would happen if i pulled this out?
you wouldn't .
audrey , look what you've done !
did they scoff the whole smorgasbord?
audrey , don't go in there .
i'm hungry .
don't go in there !
excuse me , is there something wrong , young pretty girl?
they found my friend laura ...
lying face down on a rocky beach , completely naked .
she'd been murdered .
hey , buddy .
snake .
we're out of here , man .
just a sec .
donna's still in there .
you straightened her out yet?
i don't know what's up with her .
forget her .
i've got it figured .
laura and her .
that cop mentioned something about the letter 'j '.
we're looking at some freaking biker and some freaking biker is going to get his head busted open .
what's his name?
we'll finish this quick .
come outside .
robert , i'll be home this evening if you need a sympathetic ear .
i don't need any damn sympathetic anything .
i have no idea what's going on here .
let's just go home .
so you were on a picnic , just the two of you?
way up in the mountains , not another soui around?
is there some law against having a picnic?
donna , this is interesting to me .
with just two of you out there ,
i can't figure out howthese pictures got taken .
that's easy .
there was this ... hiker that came along , a woman hiker .
she had a backpack and ... ... we asked her to take the pictures for us .
what was her name?
i don't think we asked her .
i forgot .
donna , who are you protecting?
nobody , that's really what happened .
does this person's name start with the letter 'j '?
she didn't tell us her name .
donna , this is serious business .
more serious than laura falling in love with someone other than her boyfriend .
much more serious .
agent cooper , the sheriff's ready to roll up to the site and i've got something else for you here .
you can come on in .
i know laura was your best friend .
you've been through a lot today .
we're finished for now .
go ahead , lucy .
tell agent cooper what you heard .
after bobby was taken back to his cell , his parents were standing by the door with his lawyer .
bobby was released and he came out and saw his friend mike , who was down by the water cooler , which is near my desk .
i pretended to be typing , but i was typing what mike and bobby were saying .
they didn't say exactly who it was they were talking about , but anyway here's what they were saying .
they said the person we're looking for is a biker .
looks like a hog to me .
holy smoke .
holy smoke !
the norwegians are leaving !
the norwegians are gone .
everyone here has gone .
not good .
you are throwing away the investment opportunity of a lifetime .
better that than throw a lifetime away .
you stay out of this !
sheriff .
diane , it's 4 : 10 pm at the scene of the crime .
here's something we haven't seen before : a mound of dirt , a foot and a half in diameter .
on the top is a gold necklace with a gold heart .
correction : half a gold heart .
at the base of the mound of dirt is a torn piece of newsprint written with the words , which appear to be in blood ,
fire walk with me " .
sheriff , you and i have got to find out who's got the other half of that heart .
mrs horne?
it might help if you talked to johnny yourself .
so you think it might help?
you can tell johnny one more time that laura isn't coming this afternoon to work with him .
or tomorrow afternoon or any afternoon .
what is so difficult to understand about that?
it fell down .
i knew laura .
she was always so nice .
when was the last time she came in?
i couldn't tell you exactly .
we have so many box es .
you don't keep records?
we have plenty of paperwork .
how long has she had this box?
i'd say about six months .
i could check for you .
would you , please?
and close the door on the way out .
flesh world " .
man !
there's over 10, 000 dollars here .
that's a lot of girl scout cookies .
here's a page that's marked .
ronnette pulaski .
i can't believe it .
... the law enforcement officials emerging from an abandoned railway car ...
shelly , would you turn the television off?
why , leo?
i want to see this .
shelly , turn it off . ... escaped her captor and fled to safety , remains hospitalised in critical condition ...
shelly , sit down here a minute and help me out .
what kind of cigarettes do you smoke?
whatever's around .
no , you don't .
you smoke these .
what are these doing here?
i pick up different packs from the diner all the time , me and norma .
two things , shelly .
when i come home , this house should be clean and i mean clean .
you smoke one brand of cigarettes from now on .
if i ever see two brands of cigarettes again ,
i'm going to snap your neck like a twig .
you have nothing to worry about with me , darling .
that's right .
big ed's gas farm .
ed speaking .
i'm sorry .
i know i promised not to call you there , but i have to see you .
i hurt so bad .
it's ok .
why don't i meet you at the roadhouse around 9 : 30?
thank you , ed .
i'll see you tonight .
all right , sweetheart .
i think i saw a cottontail rabbit .
must have been a snowshoe rabbit .
snowshoe?
snowshoe rabbit?
who's the babe?
that is one of the most beautiful women in the state .
mrs packard .
packard sawmill?
where's mr packard?
died in a boating accident .
andrew packard practically built this town .
brought her over from hong kong .
left her everything , which didn't exactly please his sister .
that's her , the original deep freeze .
who's the glad handing dandy?
benjamin horne , local big wig .
he owns half the town .
he's not after her .
he's after her land .
who's the lady with the log?
we call her the log lady .
ladies and gentlemen , if i could have your attention .
is this thing on?
is this thing on?
hang on , dwayne .
thank you , mayor milford .
agent cooper .
thank you , sheriff .
ladies and gentlemen , fbi special agent dale cooper .
one year ago , in a town in the south west corner of this state , the body of a young girl named teresa banks was found .
she had no family .
no one came forward to claim her body .
it wasn't even news ... until today .
there are irrefutable similarities , which i cannot discuss , that lead us to conclude laura palmer was the second and ronnette pulaski would have been the third victim of the same killer .
there is a chance the person who committed these crimes is someone from this town , possibly even someone you know .
it is vitally important that this not turn into a witch hunt .
i would suggest a temporary curfew for those under eighteen years of age .
keeping your kids off the streets now may teach them caution that may protect them in the days and weeks to come .
i will remind you that these crimes occurred at night .
when i left the house , sarah was sleeping .
leland made it through the day somehow .
i'm not sure i could have done the same .
poor dear , poor sarah .
eileen , the brutality ... the madness of it .
i know .
they're not releasing many details .
wisely , i suppose .
at the scene where it happened , no one else knows this , they found part of a necklace , half of a golden heart .
it was laura's .
they know this because she was wearing it in a video of a picnic they found .
i'm telling you this because donna was in the video with her .
she won't tell them who shot it or who else was with them , but they think the killer may have the other half of the heart .
donna , which do you like better?
the blossom of the evening " or " the full flower of the evening "?
listen to me , this is serious .
this is serious , too .
i'm going out the window and i need you to cover for me .
don't you know there's a curfew?
they announced it on the radio .
i know , einstein .
that's why i need you to cover for me .
i suppose this will include a phone conversation with mike ,
mr bonehead boyfriend?
no , this is about laura and it's really serious .
check .
thank you .
i'll need to borrow your bike .
then , pump some air in the back tyre .
yeah .
harriet , don't forget to brush your teeth .
actually , now that some time has passed ,
i like " the full blossom of the evening " .
hey , snake .
don't take any oink oink off that pretty pig .
don't you worry about that .
hi , doctor hayward .
i'd like to talk to donna .
donna's upstairs getting ready for bed , mike .
you're not drinking and driving , are you?
we're all pretty broken up about what happened today , sir .
besides , bobby's doing most of the driving .
i'll see if she wants to come down .
would you mind waiting out here , please?
the best laid plans of mice and men .
snake , let's go !
where's your sister?
dad , i'm going to tell it to you and i'm going to tell it to you straight .
harriet !
see that window?
later .
donna's not here .
you mean she snuck out?
mike , maybe you have an idea where she might have gone .
oh , we'll find her .
don't you worry about that .
roadhouse .
let's go !
sheriff , i've got a call for you from dr hayward .
i explained that you're on a stake out at the roadhouse , but he still would very much like to talk to you .
patch him through .
i'm going to patch him through to you now , sheriff .
i'm patching you through now , dr hayward .
harry , my daughter donna snuck out of the house .
i don't know where she's gone .
doc , you rest easy now .
i'm going to put out an all points for her .
we'll keep our eyes peeled .
thanks , harry .
you betcha .
lucy , you take care of that all points now .
all right , sheriff .
of course donna snuck out .
meaning what?
how else is she going to lead us to that biker?
so all afternoon i've been hanging drapes .
drapes?
drapes .
lots of them .
you know how i feel about you , ed .
don't do it for me , do it for yourself .
it's tammy wynette time , darling .
yeah?
what about you and hank?
i told you .
i'm going to leave hank .
before or after he gets parole?
i love you , ed .
i'll do what's best for both of us .
when your sweetheart's husband's in the joint for manslaughter , the word " parole " has a nasty ring to it .
you know why i'm whittling?
ok , i'll bite again .
why are you whittling?
that's what you do in a town where a yellow light still means slow down , not speed up .
mike and bobby .
there's liable to be a little trouble this evening .
scottie , mutt and jeff just crawled in .
oh , what a wonderful world !
looks like sooner than later .
why don't you whistle for a little backup?
i see which way the wind's blowing .
lucy , get us a backup unit at the roadhouse right away .
make that two .
and call dr hayward .
tell him we've found his daughter and she's fine .
all right , sheriff .
donna !
why are you sneaking around?
everybody's looking for you .
get your hands off me .
leave me alone !
get your hands off me !
get your hands off me .
let go of me .
no !
that's enough !
you heard him .
let me go !
like that , mr monkey wrench?
you guys got it covered?
don't worry , i'll take you to james .
joey paulsen .
that's a 'j '.
no , he's taking her to somebody else .
you want me to follow them at a discreet distance?
harry , you're all right .
hold on !
do you think they spotted us?
give me a doughnut .
well , harry , i think we lost them .
man , smell those trees !
smell those douglas firs .
i think i hear them .
what's down there?
an old logging road .
the only access is five miles back at the packard mill .
i told doc hayward his daughter was ok .
my fault , harry .
thanks , joe .
good luck , james .
james , they're looking for you .
i'm going to talk to them , but i think they're going to lock me up .
why?
i don't have an alibi for last night .
i was with her .
james , what happened last night?
it was kinda like a nightmare .
donna , she was a different person .
what are you saying?
i'm telling you , there were things she was involved with , things she let herself get pulled into , things she thought you'd hate her for .
she said , " there are things about me ...
she said , " even donna doesn't know me .
i knew her .
i knew her better than she thought i did .
donna , she said something about a guy getting killed .
who?
she didn't say .
but she said bobby told her that he killed this guy .
oh , my god .
this is why i had to see you .
it all makes some kind of terrible sense that she died , that someone killed her .
i don't know .
i can't explain it .
i didn't know whether to believe any of this last night .
i mean , half the time she wasn't making any sense .
i couldn't calm her down .
i could hardly keep her on the bike .
we came to the light at sparkwood and 21 , and she ... she put her hands around my neck and she screamed she loved me .
i looked into her eyes .
they were clear .
it was like she was laura again .
she was so sad .
she sounded so desperate .
then she ran off .
i let her go and she died .
it's ok .
it's not your fault , james .
it's ok .
james .
it's all right , james .
oh , my god .
i'm sorry .
oh , my god .
i changed my mind .
i'm not sorry .
james .
james .
oh , james .
those are sirens .
i've got to go to the police .
i don't have an alibi .
after she left i just rode around .
the necklace you gave laura with the golden heart .
you have to give me the other half .
why?
they found the half where she was killed and think the killer has the other half .
if you go there with the necklace and no alibi ...
what about you?
i'll get rid of it .
no .
we'll hide it .
all right .
we'll bury it .
ok .
right here .
ok .
i'll take you home .
what goes around comes around .
round and round .
that's not joey , that's james hurley .
james , stand away from the bike .
stand away from the girl .
put your hands behind your head .
he didn't do anything !
she's probably right .
james .
he didn't do anything .
lucy , get an arrest form ready .
doc , i'm releasing her to you , but i want her back for questioning in the morning .
all right , harry .
andy , hawk .
put james back in number four .
james .
it's gonna be all right .
you !
we'll check on you later .
good night , officers .
i'm sorry , dad .
donna , after what happened today ,
i'm sure you understand what you put your mother and me through tonight .
but i know you wouldn't have done it unless you had a good reason .
we also have another problem facing us , young lady .
where's your sister's bicycle?
i left it at the roadhouse .
we'll have to go get it .
i understand you promised harriet you'd put some air in the back tyre .
yes , i did .
we're so thankful to have a daughter like you .
a policeman's dream !
yup , lucy sets it up for us every night .
is everything ok?
there's extra jelly doughnuts for agent cooper and there's some extra decaf .
you know , andy's been drinking so much caffeinated coffee lately .
thank you , lucy .
you can go back to work now and no listening .
sheriff , that reminds me .
can you recommend a good , inexpensive hotel or motel?
it doesn't have to be fancy .
i can get you a good rate up at the great northern .
i think i'm going to be here for some time .
these motels promise you a good rate , but when you get there it's a different story .
all i need is a bed , a bathroom , a telephone , and sometimes a television , in the event i get a chance to knock off early .
i can get you a good rate up at the great northern .
sold .
well , tomorrow comes early .
diane , it's 12 : 28 am .
i'll be staying locally at the great northern hotel .
sheriff's getting me a rate .
when you least expect it .
hello , sheriff .
hey , jo .
i understand you wanted to see the sheriff up here .
yes , i did .
right over here .
he's here again .
let's get together and talk about it .
all right .
all right .
it must have happened about this time 24 hours ago .
i'm afraid .
