george .
so glad you like it .
rothman?
who's this rothman?
max rothman .
isn't his father in shoes?
think so .
shoes or frocks .
shoes , frocks , or stocks .
the duke of westminster used to own a spaniel called " jew " except when his rothchild banker came over .
then they called him " joe .
oo ooh , champagne .
max .
why are you wasting this divine tipple on these swine?
lnsecurity , i suppose .
lnsecurity is the mother of an overdraft .
oo ooh .
george grosz .
i hear the sound of new money .
i'm for sale .
i might pay for this evening yet .
come .
take care of grosz for me .
george .
george !
a moment .
mr. epp .
oh .
mrs. epp , i think max would like a quick word with you .
george , do you want a drink? .
hello , hello .
so nice to see you .
hello .
i have a monet downstairs .
monet?
why?
yes .
i thought this might be a tad too modern for you .
are you questioning my modernity?
god , no , no .
i hate those waterlilies , it always reminds me of a gardening catalogue .
maybe you'd like to see it?
are you sure?
i'll go down and get it .
i'll take the ernst .
and who is this funny fellow who looks like a butcher? .
grosz , george grosz .
i'll take two of him .
excellent .
didn't know you had a monet .
i don't .
how are you?
don't spiel me .
where's your wife?
waiting for her entrance , i suppose .
and where's that leave me?
talented , with options .
i'm tired of options .
you're too young to be tired of options .
i'd really love to see you again .
tell me , max , where's the future in it?
the future?
no ...
i've seen the future .
believe me , it came straight at us .
there's no future in the future .
so you might as well
nina , mon amour .
nice to see you .
hello , darling .
how'd it go?
hm mm .
i fell out at every turn , but they seemed to like it .
that's what matters .
it's going well?
who knows?
do you know what you look like?
like your wife , i hope .
no .
like a woman defying gravity .
that's what we do , us ladies .
i left my cigarettes at the theater .
poppy .
the champagne .
poppy .
there's one more case on the sidewalk .
and these are on loan .
i'll pay you back with interest .

yeah , the list .
and you?

hussars .
nah , cavalry .

lnside the door .
thank you , corporal .
ls this your building?
ls this some sort of club?
i sell art .
ln here?
uh huh . ls that a portfolio?
yeah .
fork it over , let's take a look .
what's your market then?
mostly modern stuff .
oh , modern .
like uh ... next time i have diarrhea i'll take a shit on a canvas and bring it round to you , huh?
you could do worse .
i certainly wouldn't reject it out of hand ,
i'm open to everything .
would you like a cigarette?
they give you cancer of the lung .
are you a doctor? .
hello , darling .
liselore von peltz , this is corporal
hitler .
adolf hitler .
hello .
thank you for coming .
ls she your wife?
my wife's inside .
you're a funny one .
come in .
have a glass of champagne .
i don't drink .
that's original .
yes , well
best be on my way .
thanks again for the hand .
the 16th?
we were together at ypres .
yes , we were .
perhaps only a few kilometers apart .
i did some modern stuff in the trenches .
that i would very much like to see .
you know where to find me .
max rothman .
das eisern werk .
how do you like your fish , daddy?
mm mm , lovely .
ja , that was delicious .
are you finished?
you hardly touched it .
i don't know how you stay so thin .
she has a parasite .
i don't , thank god .
yes , yes , but tell her about that girl in the company .
oh , esther swallowed a tapeworm .
on purpose .
a jewish girl did this?
isn't that fabulous?
why?
to lose weight , mammy .
i don't think this is dinnertable conversation .
yes , but thank god it's lunch and we're all grown up .
as a medical man , don't you find that fascinating?
here is a girl who has a certain a certain aesthetic standard which she ... adheres herself to
i don't think this is an appropriate conversation .
i know , i know , it certainly isn't .
but wouldn't the condition be chronic if it took , nin?
did it?
all right .
let's talk about ... the weather , literally .
have you been outside today?
isn't it gorgeous?
i think it's what the english call an lndian summer .
but it's november .
i don't think max is saying that it isn't , dad .
isn't that what they call the last days of october , november
lndian summer? .
no , no , that's autumn .
what they call fall .
i'm going for a stroll .
he hasn't been able to sit still since he came back .
balls !
he was already a neuropath before the war .
do you know what ferdi told me yesterday?
doctors are mostly judged by their hands .
fucking bourgeois prick .
our commander lost half the battalion because he had
a " von " before his name .
you're saying the russians are right?
i'm saying we shouldn't be so quick to judge them ,
maybe they're onto something .
they're onto something all right .
they never should have killed the tsar .
really?
why?
because the tsar was such a good guy?
what about those kids , did they deserve a bullet?
and that little boy?
to make stew , you gotta chop meat .
and what kind of stew is that , soldier? .
speak up .
hello , hello .
no , no , no , don't get up .
a little taste for everyone .
nothing's wrong with that .
nothing at all .
but let's take a closer look at these stew chefs .
marx ...
jew .
lenin ... mongrel jew .
trotsky ...
jew from " a " to " z .
yeah , so?
did you ever know a jew to do anything for anybody else , except raise your rent?
what do you think , corporal?
i don't believe in anti semitism .
not in emotive anti semitism anyway .
what the hell does that mean?
it means i don't believe that anti semitism should be based on emotions which just leads to pogrom and anarchy but rather on the facts .
i'm not sure i quite understand your point , corporal .
my point is , captain , that the semitic question is far too important to be left to the individual .
it ought to be in the domain of the government ,
like public health or sewage .
i think you look handsome .
what's the price on this?
i'm not gonna bite .
seven marks for the suit .
two marks for the shirt .
and the tie we'll call it an even 10 .
why put a gallery in an ironworks?
you know what they used to make here?
locomotives .
and now they're recovering the iron and steel and selling it as scrap .
beating swords into ploughshares?
that wouldn't be a bad lead .
no , no , that's too soft , that's too pacifistic .
not subversive enough .
subversive?
yes , subversive .
i mean , jesus god , what a giant piece of kitsch theater this last war was .
it was all fought on rail and yet the kaiser went on horse surrounded by the princes with the regiments and the banners snapping in the breeze like it was agincourt .
but it wasn't agincourt , was it?
but you're an ex cavalry man .
so i know exactly of which i speak .
and from now on we must make art with the same unsentimentality , the same principles that we would the manufacture of bayonets .
bayonets?
yes , or maybe wash bins would work .
no , we'll stick with bayonets .
bayonets is a lot sharper .
yes it is .
yes .
mind if we take a look around?
be my guest .
ah , corporal hitler .
hit ler .
not living in the barracks anymore?
it's not like there's a lot of cheap housing around for vets , is there?
no , i suppose there isn't .
can i offer you some coffee?
no , i never touch it .
no caffeine , no alcohol , no nicotine , no meat .
you're an ascetic .
not at all , i'm a man of the people .
i see you brought your goods .
don't expect anything abstract .
i'm a great believer in schopenhauer's dictum that art should proclaim ,
yes by god , this is how it really is .
but life can be quite abstract at times , wouldn't you agree?
how do you mean?
sometimes " life , " as you say , won't be captured by the forms and lines of traditional representation ,
especially not these days .
i disagree completely .
art should only ever reflect the eternal values and the natural laws , especially these days .
but aren't these eternal values and natural laws in flux these days?
aren't they meant to be shrinking and expanding?
what are you , some kind of intellectual wet fart?
the eternal values are : harmonious proportions ; nobility and dignity ; and the continuation of the cultural evolution , where each generation stands upon the shoulders of the next and improves the work of the last .
but this is ... 10 , no , 100 steps backwards .
this is the undoing of the previous generations .
this is filth !
this is blood poisoning .
are you a friend of marinetti's?
ls that what this is about?
yes?
some sort of mad reverse futurist?
futurists?
yes , ltalians .
they experienced the war " pictorially .
like you , i'm hoping .
some of the ltalians fought well .
he served , right?
grosz?
yes he did , grenadier guards , i think .
bolshie , huh?
no , not really .
just pissed off .
oh , yeah .
what's he pissed off about?
he thinks people should have the right to strike .
and you , rothman?
are you pissed off? .
about the right to strike?
no , about your arm .
you were gonna be a painter , right?
you're a funny one .
well?
i think it's good , but i think you could go even deeper .
deeper? .
what do you mean , deeper? .
i mean it's good , but i sense you're just scratching at the surface .
when i look at this work i see a pretty solid technique , but what i am missing is an authentic voice .
one gets the feeling that you're holding something back and for the work to really leap forward , to take the next step .
i keep going back to this notion of an authentic voice .
what i mean to say is , i was there , and you were there , and i know what it looked like , but what did it feel like?
that's what we want to know , isn't it?
does any of what i'm saying resonate?
i suppose what i'm trying to say is you have to go as deep as you possibly can .
then you have to gather yourself and say , " okay , i just broke the surface deeper still .
you know , rothman ...
when i came back from this war ,
i came back to nothing .
really nothing .
no homeland , no home , no parents , no family , no fiancee , no profession , no job , no food , no closet full of ... old hockey sticks and tennis rackets .
not even an address .
all i have in this world is the conviction that i am a great artist and a master builder .
and you just stole from that .
from the one thing that's mine a rich boy like you .
so , if art as an object is dead , why is everything so expensive?
otherwise nobody would buy it .
you bolshie bastard .
fucking communist .
fucking comrade communist .
bastard .
bolshie .
bolshevik .
get up .
come on , you stupid pig .
looks like corporal hitler had a difficult time in the city .
communist bastard .
keeping warm , corporal?
friend of yours?
it's a study for a work called " the cultural consumptive .
i know the type .
just clever enough to be unhappy .
you're an interesting man .
artists aren't known for their nerve .
you were awarded the lron cross , first class , weren't you?
would you like to learn how to speak in public?
we're offering a course to certain people .
what kind of course?
a course in a new kind of science .
it is called propaganda .
the course consists of  yes , i know about propaganda .
well it also consists of philosophy , history , economics .
i'm going to be frank with you , corporal , we're in trouble .
germany's balanced on a razor's edge .
will she fall to the left or to the right?
i think that depends largely on the army , sir .
you strike me as an unusually perceptive man , corporal .
may we count on you?
of course , the army will pay for your expenses .
hm mm?
lads , may i present for your edification
herr von lieberfelt and his troupe?
sorry , major von lieberfelt .
men , good evening .
i'm here to present you with a challenge .
have you ever noticed that the jews only fuck each other? .
why?
because they guard the purity of their blood .
so , if we guard the purity of our blood the way they guard the purity of their blood , we see the world as it really is .
our divine ancestors , the aryans , came to earth from outer space .
forged in a matrix of ice and war ,
ar became the first divine artist warrior .
but then ... the aryan was lead into temptation by soft swarthy people from bountiful lands .
shh hh .
shh hh .
and ar's blood is polluted .
and ar grows weak .
and ar becomes the slave of the jews .
grail knights !
yes , because you are grail knights .
lf we guard the purity of our blood , we have it in our power to again straddle the earth like supermen .
i eat a little grilled fish , no meat no red meat lots of fruit ,
lots of green vegetables , cheese .
nina's father : .
how are you sleeping?
six hours a night .
that's not enough .
that's too much .
i sleep too much .
no stimulants .
i'm off coffee .
everything has to be bio now .
steamed vegetables .
he has a new doctor .
why doesn't he come see me?
you don't charge enough .
i've lost 15 lbs .
i'm in and out of the tailor all the time .
i don't charge enough? !
what does she mean? !
hullo , it's hamlet .
hello , all .
doctor , anna .
mother , may i say you look very well?
you owe me two cases no , three cases
i'll put them in the car before you leave .
do you know the difference between a jewish mother and a rottweiler? .
yes .
poppy , you've lost weight .
you noticed?
eventually the rottweiler lets go .
we have coffee , we have cake , we have sherry , we have indigestion just looking at it .
he doesn't eat .
he has my delicate system .
he should come and see me .
hello .
hey , sis .
excellent , you brought the brood .
hi , sweetie .
hello .
hello .
hey , max .
hello there .
hello .
poppa .?
happy birthday to you happy birthday to you??
happy birthday , dear paulie??
happy birthday to you .?
yeah !
plates , please  plates , please .
would you like some cake?
thank you for your plate .
such a lovely boy .
as i was saying , max , it's a bubble , a chimera .
everybody and his mother wants to be a speculator these days , and nobody knows what they're doing .
never been in it in my life , you know that .
not productive .
all anybody wants to talk about today is the market .
such a bore .
how's your sentimental life?
torrid .
yours?
arid , but sunny .
and how is your sentimental life?
that's not a penis , is it?
i think she might be dreaming of one .
you have much more fun in your day than we had in mine .
men !
i have terrible news .
our government , if you can call this group of jews , homosexuals , and draft dodgers a government , has accepted a peace in versailles , a piece so unjust , it will surely lead to another war , thank god .
thank god , because an army at peace is like a whore at mass no bloody good to anyone .
stabbed in the back .
by who , sir? .
who said that?
me .
doesn't matter .
doesn't matter .
what matters is that germany is absolved from having
lost the war and prepared to wage the next one .
fellow loses a game , he doesn't want to play anymore .
you tell him he lost because someone else cheated , then you have to hold him back from picking up the cards again .
just remember , the army is the only vital element of our society .
war is vitality .
war is the hygiene of the world .
yes?
versailles , no , no , no .
the treaty is unfair .
versailles , no , no , no .
germany for the germans .
what are they saying?
versailles .
give us back our land !
they're saying versailles .
here are the terms of the treaty of versailles .
germany is to cede alsace lorraine to france
what? " upper silesia and west prussia to poland .
poland?
" the army will be reduced to 100, 000 men .
france will occupy the rhineland for the next 15 years and germany will assume a war debt of 20 million gold marks .
there aren't 20 million marks in this entire country .
furthermore ,
germany is to sign a so called war guilt clause in which she assumes sole responsibility for the war .
i'm ashamed to be german today .
hey .
hey .
there's a meeting down the street .
i didn't serve ,
i just played the market .
i lost my arm in the crash .
come on , brother . ... alsace lorraine to france .
this is disgusting !
we are being stabbed in the back !
just 'cause you take it in the ass .
stabbed in the back !
this guy is full of shit .
he works for the army .
he's a provocateur .
and look at his muscle .
bastards , fucking bastards .
let him be , boys , let him be .
a provoc
a provac?
that's a french word , isn't it?
no wonder i can't get my tongue around it .
you ever notice with chaps like this that their french is really good?
so's their russian better than their german , actually .
i'll tell you who i am , because i've got nothing to hide .
i'm a little man , four years in the trenches .
don't speak french .
don't know the latin .
never made it past corporal .
guess that's because i didn't have a " von " before my name .
you might say i'm the unknown soldier just like you .
what do you think? .
i think he's a nothing , sir .
he's got a big mouth .
gassed , almost went blind ...
you're right , he's a nothing .
perhaps that's his secret .
perhaps it's the age of the nothing .
lots of lads got it worse .
now i'm back looking for a job .
can't find one , though .
paid 10 marks for a suit .
you paid too much .
that's what i said to the jew who sold it to me .
i can see where this is going .
make no mistake , nothing new , nothing new .
germany's greatest enemy
lives within .
herr rothman .
herr rothman , i'm i'm honored .
i happened to be in the neighborhood , so
i'm sorry i left so abruptly the other day .
you know what they say in spain , don't you?
no , i don't .
it's easy to fight the bull from the barrera .
bullfighting is completely immoral .
it's vile and disgusting .
no , no .
it means it's easier to be a critic than an artist .
what did you think of my speech?
let's just say if you were to put the same amount of energy into your art as you do your speaking , you may have something going .
i best be on my way .
hitler , come on , i'll buy you a glass of lemonade .
come on .
where'd you get the sunglasses?
progg and fromm .
try 'em .
chic .
very chic , rothman .
can i get another coffee?
strong .
waiter : .
yes , sir , i'll get it .
so you're an anti semite?
on the contrary , i admire the jews .
really?
yes , they're very intelligent people .
there are intelligent ones and not so intelligent ones ...
they're all intelligent because they guard the purity of their blood .
what?
the purity of the blood .
because the secret of the jews lies in their pure jewish blood .
that's why they're the mightiest counterpart to the aryan race .
what's the secret?
ls your father jewish?
yes , he is .
mother? .
why not ask whether she's a german?
mensch !
of course your mom's jewish .
you're an awfully hard man to like , hitler , but i'm gonna try , because if i've learned anything over the past four years , it's that we all shit the same , scream the same , and die the same .
there's no need for vulgarity , rothman .
i know where you've been and god knows we've all been turned into assholes there .
listen to me well , you may not think you're an anti semite ,
but in fact you are .
i'm not .
but in this , as in all things , there's a reason .
your own hero nietzsche said anti semitism is the ideology of those who feel cheated .
how do you know nietzsche's my hero?
you've obviously skimmed his ideas .
i don't feel cheated .
excellent .
then stop acting like it .
are you gonna smoke another cigarette?
you just put one out .
exactly .
now where is my instinct , my secret instinct for self preservation , i ask you?
i've heard these theories all my life .
blood science , eugenics , it's rubbish .
it's complete nonsense , it's kitsch .
put it out of your mind .
it's not modern , it's not scientific .
it will hold you back as an artist .
speaking of which , how's your work coming along?
and why are you making those appalling speeches for the army?
i'm just keeping my hand in it .
keeping your hand in what?
the army is paying my expenses .
so you don't actually believe that rubbish .
don't tell me you're happy with the " peace .
hello , max .
hello , esther .
how are you , sweetheart?
i think the " peace " is a travesty .
but i don't think i can be bothered to pick up the german banner from the mud with my left arm .
i gave at the office , you know .
yes ... yes , yes , you did .
i'm thinking about writing a book on politics , you know? .
you're a man of many talents .
where do you find time to paint?
mensch , use your head .
i'm still in the army .
i'm folding laundry .
i'm cleaning out the shithouses .
painting costs money .
i don't have a pot to piss in .
here's what i'd like to do .
i'd like to take some of your work off consignment .
here's an advance against your future sales .
spend it any way you like .
find yourself a nice girl .
get drunk .
get out of politics .
rothman , you you've saved my life .
maybe you're right .
maybe i've yet to find my authentic voice .
maybe i should get more modern .
lf i'm to be completely honest with myself ,
i've always admired some of the ideas behind cubism .
seems to me you have a great affinity for ideas .
ls that some clever way of saying i have poor technique?
try not to be one of those people who finds a slight in any compliment .
i imagine it would just be altogether too bourgeois to turn on the heat .
on top of me .
below me .
lnside of me .
i am always by your side .
i have to go .
half man , half doll .
every woman's dream .
bills , bills , bills , fraulein .
bills are so violent .
sorry , sorry
i couldn't stop him .
there you are , rothman .
slept in late , did you?
what are you doing?
what do you mean , what am i doing?
you told me i had a show .
a show? .
a show? . !
i told you i would take some of your work on consignment .
they way i understand that term is
i keep some of your work informally ,
in trust " as it were and if i can move it , i move it .
how are you going to " move it " if it's not up?
am i in your studio looking over your shoulder? .
no .
so don't teach your grandmother how to suck eggs .
so you're not actually going to show the work .
no .
and i will tell you why .
new works " by arp ,
ernst , and grosz at das eisern werk ,
november 15th to december 15th .
so after december 15th .
can we take it one step at a time?
listen , rothman , i've lost four years .
yes , we all lost four years , some of us a little more .
do you want a show? .
i'd kill for you if you gave me a show .
don't kill for me , please .
just do what you do .
be anxious , be nervous .
tell me you're the unknown soldier come back to haunt us , with your brush , with your brush .
can you do that?
'cause that's what you got to do .
you've gotta take this pent up stuff you're quivering with and you've gotta hurl it onto the canvas .
it doesn't have to be good and beautiful , it just has to be true .
and even if it's a lie , make it an interesting lie and i'll put it up , i swear .
you do think i'm talented , don't you?
i think there's something rustling behind your curtain .
good bye .
there are times
i have these terrible doubts .
paint them .
paint your doubts , really !
well?
well?
one morning , i wish you'd just say , " good morning .
how did you pass the night?
the lovely mrs. rothman?
your children in good health , i trust?
you're such a bourgeois .
any news?
yes , i'm meeting an american dentist .
a big collector .
mensch !
that's good , isn't it?
lf i see you anywhere near that building ,
i will personally set fire to your entire life's work .
speaking of which , when am i going to see something new? .
soon , soon .
i need new things .
i'm very motivated by newness .
newness really does it for me .
there's dr. and mrs. levi .
hello !
ah , levi , huh?
you'll make the sale for sure , huh?
what can one say about paul klee that hasn't been said 100 times before?
and on the other end of the spectrum , there's a young artist i've discovered recently named hitler .
less aggressively modern perhaps , but a real example ... of what i call " krieg kunst .
war art?
precisely , doctor , precisely .
not as mannered or tutored as max ernst , but a very authentic voice of the trenches .
the voice of the everyman .
the voice of the unknown soldier .
and as a gesture of solidarity with soviet constructivism ,
i would only ask five marks for these pieces .
hard to go wrong for five marks .
what do you think , darling?
they bought the ernst !
oh my god .
i'm gonna die in some doorway
like a dog in the street .
a complete unknown !
nonsense .
i'm i'm 30 .
i'm 30 !
could you put that out , please?
no , fuck you !
i'm in my own place .
you want the truth?
i'll tell you the truth .
you're a bit lazy .
a chap like ernst , up at the crack of dawn , working .
this ernst , what's he look like?
he's rather good looking .
rather like me , huh?
mm huh .
eyes?
light .
hello .
yes , but could you paint that?
of course i could .
the man has no technique .
technique is not what makes the painting interesting .
what makes it compelling is what max ernst reveals .
you could almost say he admits , confesses , about himself .
could you do that?
could you be so voluptuous with yourself? .
hm mm?
i think so .
the train is leaving the station .
why aren't you on board?
i don't know .
i'm in your hands .
hand .
i've been going to seances .
really?
that sounds progressive .
yes , it is .
it's most instructive to learn how the old german gods were usurped by the young god of lsrael , the god of guilt , the projection of slaves .
sounds like lunch at my house .
always the joker , huh?
why are we here?
what has this got to do with modern art?
nothing , i just like it here .
i thought you were gonna teach me about modern art .
it's inhuman what they're doing to these birds .
it's inhuman .
why don't you set them free?
that'd be a great art project .
we'd have chinese nightingales in the park for years to come .
they'd sing in the snow .
and people would come for miles around and they would be known as hitler's nightingales .
are you on the spike?
ls that what's wrong with you?
bloody hell !
damn it !
hullo , midgets .
what are you doing , dad?
dad said a bad word .
you are a very clever girl , ada , love of my life .
you're right .
that's exactly what dad has been thinking about , " words .
good words ...
and bad words .
because words are magic .
sometimes i think the world is strung together by words .
victory !
poppy?
yes , young man?
ln the world upside down , what would we be doing now? .
ln the world upside down , we'd be having breakfast .
and what would we have for breakfast?
ln the world upside down?
let's see .
for breakfast we'd have grilled sole , green beans , new potatoes , plum pudding for dessert , yum !
and in the world upside down right now i would say ,
i hate you , i hate you , i hate you , paulie .
i'd loathe you beyond reason , wouldn't l?
now go to sleep .
and tomorrow we'll fly around the sun together .
he would be .
hello , darling .
hi , sweetheart .
george grosz , adolf hitler .
my wife nina .
you  hello .
nice guy .
oh , he's a futurist .
really , what's his name?
hitler .
never heard of him .
you will .
are you ready?
oh , hitler .
are you a painter? .
yes , i'm an artist .
you are a friend of my husband's?
of sorts .
ln august 1914 , i volunteered for the army and was accepted to my father's old regiment , the light hussars .
i used to think we rode into the war on horseback , but now i realize that in fact we rode into the war on words .
yes , my friend , words .
lf the high command had used nails to hammer our feet to the mud ,
i think we would've found a pair of pliers , passed them down the line and made a break for it , but the words , the words kept us rooted to the ground .
now these are magical words , used in mass hypnosis .
and if you would like millions of young men to give up their lives for your cause , you must first learn these words .
repeat after me .
the enemy is " the foe " or " the host .
the enemy is the foe or the host .
danger is " peril .
danger is peril .
to be brave is to be " gallant .
to be brave is to be gallant .
the dead oh , yes , the dead , they're not " dead .
they are " the fallen .
one's chest is one's " breast .
to move quickly is to be " swift .
a soldier is
a warrior .
a warrior .
war is " strife .
actions are " deeds .
to die is to " perish .
to sleep is to " slumber .
the sky are the " heavens .
blood , " elan vital .
and arms and legs ... ... are " noble limbs .
hey , soldier .
thank you .
it's disgusting !
it's revolting !
that was a miscalculation of rare magnitude , wouldn't you say?
you're the dealer .
they want you to sell their paintings and make 'em rich , not scare the fuckin 'shit out of 'em .
darling , that wasn't paulie's cowboy hat , was it?
what a masquerade he puts on .
hussar this , father's regiment that .
as german as you or i , butter wouldn't melt in his mouth .
finagling himself , throwing his money around .
finding himself a german whore and of course all the while staying married in the faith .
always working on the inside from the outside .
why , the patient looks perfectly healthy .
but then you look at the turd , but really look at it , and then you see the worms crawling around .
there weren't any of the men there , were there?
no , no .
only artists and the usual degenerates .
i'm sure they adored it .
they hated it .
they hated it !
they stood there like stiffs .
it went over their head .
this rothman this this rothman
rothman made the whole war look small and pointless , ridiculous , absurd .
don't despair , junge .
you've got your own talent , you have to let it out .
let it out .
... is essentially feminine , it takes
hello . a strong masculine type .
rothman .
what did you think? .
the other night?
my disaster? .
did it remind you of ypres?
or was it just rubbish?
yes , what did you think? .
it didn't remind me of ypres .
no?
what did it remind you of , if anything?
it reminded me perhaps perhaps , of a particularly disgusting and depraved dream of ypres .
as opposed to the happy , glorious one .
exactly .
exactly !
which your piece implies is ipso facto impossible .
listen to them , farting higher than their asshole .
what was that you said , erich?
i said  yes , i know what you said .
my question was rhe tor i cal .
it's a difficult word , isn't it , erich?
shall i ask you to spell it?
well , this was fun but duty calls and i must mind the store .
can't give up the day job .
we forgive you for a lot , don't we?
forgive and forget , turn the other way where others wouldn't .
nicht , erich?
nicht?
my god , what philistines you all are !
rothman .
how's my career going?
slow .
the whole market's slow right now .
who are those gentlemen?
guttersnipes .
don't seem very good company .
i'm flirting with politics again .
it's a party that promotes the interests of the veteran , but sometimes you have to build a base from the base .
do you?
i'll just have to take your word for that .
listen , do you want to meet some girls?
girls?
yes , hitler , girls .
those brilliant creatures who make you feel artistic without doing a stitch of work .
come on .
afternoon .
afternoon .
so there were parts of it you liked?
i know you're more of a patriot than i am .
where'd you come up with the idea of the toys?
my son .
you should have children .
they give you good ideas .
ever consider the future , hitler? .
the future?
i think all my work's based on the future .
yes , and what do you see?
do you see fame , money , beautiful lovers?
i see myself teaching .
hm mm .
and you , rothman?
how do you see the future?
look inside my pocket .
would you die for the mother in law land?
you're a menace , rothman .
i got another one for you .
war is the instrument with which the happy " no , no , reverse that .
war is the instrument by which the unhappy turn the happy
into themselves .
mensch .
don't you know genius and happiness go together about as well as cheese and chalk? .
cheese and chalk .
paint that .
no , i disagree .
you know that all great cultures die from the same cause , blood poisoning .
don't you know that all great truly great art comes from the struggle the titanic , the epic , the eternal struggle .
are you saying all art should be political?
no , no , no , dear girl ,
i'm simply speaking of the pure blood mixture .
everything depends on blood mixture and the resultant drops in racial levels .
hitler's very concerned with blood .
we think , we hope it's a metaphor .
he's a futurist .
doesn't he sort of remind you of marinetti?
no , no .
he does a bit .
what are you doing with this man?
he's the most horrible creature .
he doesn't have any friends .
of course he doesn't have any friends , he doesn't listen .
and this thing about blood .
he had a bad war .
no , darling , you had a bad war .
i'm sure he had a fine war .
what do you feel guilty about , max? .
i don't feel guilty .
i think guilt is a second rate emotion .
on the other hand , when i came back from the war ,
i came back to my family , and my bank account , my parents and the best care .
and he came back to nothing , but really nothing .
clearly you do feel guilty .
no , but i acknowledge the fact that i don't know what it's like to come back to nothing .
darling , you're wrong .
you've come back to nothing and every day i see you turn that into something so beautiful .
i told him the other day that his insane fucking ideas were holding him back as an artist and he tries , he really does , sometimes .
until tonight , of course , but that's because he feels insecure being around you two lovely ladies .
just remember ,
florence nightingale died of syphilis .
and that means what?
don't get too close to your charity cases .
you've got chocolate all over your mouth .
thank you .
that's very nice of you .
i just want to know what he has in that briefcase , it's the second time he went to the loo .
he just left .
fucking bitches .
forget about it , rothman .
may l?
the artist at home .
what an artist you are .
what a vision , so clear such focus .
i almost feel guilty asking you this , because i don't want to take you away from your work , but for a while we've been taking an interest in a small political party .
it has 500 or 600 members .
it's called the national socialist workers party .
don't let the name fool you , they are as socialist as you and me .
we had a speaker scheduled for them , but the fellow's come down with a cold .
so we were wondering if you'd be persuaded to say a few words .
but of course ,
i understand if the muses are
david , what do you think of the future?
i think it's expensive .
max .
how are you?
fine .
you look fine .
thank you .
ls that a fur bath?
yes .
yes , it is .
yes it is .
gert is in good health , i trust?
yeah , she's fine , she's fine .
so am l in the soup , as they say?
no , no , no , the soup's good .
you're in the shit .
oh , that's nice .
max , this is serious .
i know you're just careless , but the tax people could easily take a different position .
hm mm .
what do you suggest?
i suggest we write them a check right away and we plead forgetfulness and artistic license .
i can't , i'm skint .
i just gave george an advance .
you promised you were gonna run this as a business .
could you borrow from your father? .
no , i don't want to bother him .
arrange for another loan against das eisen werk .
it's not so simple .
the boys at the bank are gonna want to know what it's for .
ask your dad .
it's so much simpler , it's just a loan .
hello , fraulein .
hello .
good bye , max .
good bye , david .
what is it that your brother calls the art business?
baked air .
baked air .
that is so ...
great .
sorry i'm late , herr rothman .
you know that horrible little tramp who's always making you feel guilty?
herr hitler .
he's making a speech near us , where we live and i really think you should hear what he has to say .
it's disgusting !
we are being stabbed in the back !
we won this war ! .
our boys fought like lions !
like lions !
so why in the name of providence are we giving away 70, 000 square miles of land and abandoning six million of our fellow germans? !
because we have been stabbed in the back !
by the profiteers and the maggots and the parasites .
and make no mistake ,
germany's greatest enemy lives within .
deutschlanders ... !
deutschlanders ... !
deutschlanders ... !
deutschlanders ... !
deutschlanders ... !
deutschlanders ... !
ah , rothman .
there you are .
well , what do you think? .
what can one say?
this is ... the new art .
i realized something that all you hoity toity types missed drinking your coffee , smoking your cigarettes with your mistresses .
the way to reinvent art is not to make it political far too small a step .
no , rothman , you could say you and i were ploughing the same furrows for a while , but then i made the bigger leap .
politics is the new art .
yes , rothman , my whole life has been a detour to this moment .
everything i've struggled to learn about art , about design , color , composition , theater , opera , architecture
i'm gonna stuff it all into this and make it live again .
i've always thought you to be an intuitive futurist .
you're so disappointing .
am i only acceptable to you if you can classify me?
isn't that emblematic of the world we both despise?
what's happened to you?
you're suddenly so conventional .
go deeper , you said .
well , i went deep .
i went deeper than any artist has ever gone before !
where is the work , my dear? .
where is the evidence of this journey into the abyss?
i am the new avant garde !
i am the new artist practicing the new art !
and politics is the new art !
hello .
hello .
you look pensive .
no , no , no ...
i was just thinking
where are you going?
i have to return some drawings .
and i'm being dragged to shul again tonight .
he just wants to get away from your mother .
sometimes i think we're all marching backwards .
how do i rate?
as a partner? .
promising .
especially when you learn to apply yourself .
while on the subject , i hear it takes more than one girl to tell you that you're still handsome .
but at a certain point ... it starts to get in the way ...
of
progress?
exactly .
you know , progress really does it for me .
i'll see you tonight .
well , i'm ... sorry it didn't work out .
yes .
well , look , rothman , you're a  a  a what , hitler? .
you're a a well born sort of person .
by caesarean , actually .
a nice sort of person .
there's a lot of people in this country who don't like
well born sorts .
we'll just have to live with that , won't we?
what's this?
some designs .
hm mm .
my god .
that's certainly an alternative to boring old modernism .
this is some old new future world , isn't it?
yes .
this will be the symbol for the whole movement , it's a sanskrit symbol for energy , for the sun , but i've reversed it .
yeah this that i've seen before .
yes , but against a white background?
my god , you really worked this out , didn't you?
down to the uniforms
and  yes , i see .
and what kind of roads .
roads?
even in the more thickly populated areas these large super roads will create a sense of open space and of flying .
hitler , this is meant work .
you finally found your voice .
the future ... as a return to the past .
you wouldn't show it , would you?
yes .
i will .
because this work well this work belongs in a gallery .
you're not pulling my leg , are you?
because
i do have a career in politics , you know .
well , hitler , what would you rather do?
change the way people see or how they pay their taxes?
meet me at metropole , 9 : 30 .
bring everything , the whole shmear .
he's created this whole new world and he has all these flags and drawings with these teutonic references .
that doesn't sound very futuristic .
no , but you can't say it's not a coherent vision , down to detailed notes on his foreign policy .
he's created these epic roadways where the traveler will experience the feeling of flight .
he's resurrected all the german gods and it's all complete kitsch from " a " to " z .
it's very interesting , it's future kitsch .
god , he sounds mad .
oh , he's barking and what he's pushing makes the kaiser seem like a sunday painter .
i saw him speak .
that sounds a bit of a worry .
no , he's dreadful .
he just stands there shouting slogans and posing and the whole thing's like a giant art project .
of course the minute i said i'd show him
politics went out the window .
exactly .
it's gonna be a big show , a big , big , show .
i'm gonna bring in some english artists  you can't afford it .
french ones .
there's this character called duchamp , he's very interesting .
he does things with urinals and wine racks says in the future , everything is art .
ah , the meshugener show .
poppy !
the future is subversive .
and i don't want to see any stiffs up front .
yesterday there was nothing but stiffs .
i never got going .
i don't have any control over who's in front .
mensch , are you daft?
this is about control .
that's the thing about art you don't just slap on the paint , even if it looks that way .
i need more enthusiasm up front .
i need the energy , it's like a loop .
they give it to me , i give it to them , they give it to me .
could you put that out , please?
it bothers my voice .
and this is the last time .
no more .
what are you talking about?
i'm through .
you're through?
find somebody else .
rothman's gonna give me a show .
rothman?
rothman?
max rothman?
are you mad?
you think herr rothman will lift a finger for you?
you have one of the most authentic germanic voices
i've ever heard .
and you're 30 years old .
it's now or never .
what are you waiting for? .
they are your canvas .
that's your paint .
what are you waiting for? .
let it out .
let it out !
today today ...
i will address something central to my thinking !
today , i will address the jewish question !
not long ago i was strolling when i suddenly encountered an apparition in a black caftan and black hair locks !
my first question was ,
ls this a jew? .
and then the more i stared , the more my first question assumed a new form ,
ls this a german? !
no .
ls there any form of filth , particularly in cultural life without a jew involved in it? !
because when you cut into an abscess , what do you find? !
like maggots in a rotting body , a kike !
with the appearance of the first settlement , the jew is suddenly at hand !
the stranger is given a friendly reception !
he soon becomes an active part of the economic life of the settlement !
he begins to lend money !
now the jew is a steady resident !
commerce and finance have become his complete monopoly !
he begins a second phase where he begins to emphasize his judaism less and his germanism more !
yes , he becomes , if you can believe it ,
germanic !
culturally he contaminates art and literature !
theater ! .
religion ridiculed !
ethics and morality pissed on !
german girls turned into whores !
whores !
the jew casts off his final cloak and becomes the blood jew !
the tyrant becomes the vampire of nations !
the vampire of the people of deutschland !
blood jew !
blood jew !
blood jew !
blood jew !
the blood jew !
blood jew !
blood jew !
blood jew !
blood jew !
blood jew !
blood jew !
blood jew !
blood jew !
blood jew !
you coming for supper? .
mm mm .
no .
i have to meet someone at the metropole at 9 : 30 .
can i drop you?
no , i'd like to walk .
i should get more exercise .
i'm seeing a hypnotist monday .
that's good .
are you sure i can't drop you?
kiss mammy for me .
oh god .
leave him .
he's finished .
