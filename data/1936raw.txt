i think i'll give her a call this afternoon .
oh , that's a good idea .
she likes her job?
yeah , she seems to .
she wouldn't tell me if she didn't .

as usual , you've spoiled us .
yes , eileen .
everything was absolutely delicious .
it was nothing .
i didn't do anything .
if this isn't doing anything , well , you should be so lucky , tom .
well , i'm so sorry wayne couldn't be here .
oh , that's all right .
he never liked us .
what is your emergency?
yes .
hello?
i need to report a missing person .
hello?
mrs. hayes , this is detective seymour .
there was no sign of break in .
doors were locked .
alarm was set .
can you think of a reason why he'd be parked there?
no .
did he know anyone in the neighborhood?
no , not that i'm aware of .
was he under any particular kind of stress?
no , i don't think so .
what's your husband's height?
he's six foot .
weight?
175 , 180 pounds .
eyes?
blue .
blond hair .
mom?
hi .
how's the baby?
he's still such a bad sleeper .
sometimes i wonder how he's gonna get on in the world .
he's gonna be one of those grown men living with their mother .
your next one will be better .
think you'll get one of each?
no .
we're not gonna have a next one .
he's in our bed every night .
oh , i'd love to see them .
doyou think they could come out?
yeah .
we'll see .
so , tell me more about what the police said .
it was questions mostly .
wanted to know if anything had been bothering him recently .
apparently , people wander off all the time .
they said that?
they said they were going to check the river .
oh , that's not dad .
no .
wayne !
wayne .
yeah .
hi , wayne .
hi .
i don't know if you remember me arnold .
arnold mack from hadley .
that was a long time ago .
yeah , it sure was .
uh , i'm supposed to show this to you .
what the hell are you doing?
if you make a noise , i'll shoot .
give me the keys .
your hands .
keep 'em behind your back !
legs out .
let's have your shoes .
now tell your wife you're all right .
am i?
yes .
this is wayne .
eileen , i'm fine .
jill !
the possibility that they're watching the house ... is something we have to take seriously .
that means we'll set up surveillance and stay with you until the situation is resolved .
they've instructed you to confirm receipt of the keys in a personal ad .
that's a common mode of communication minimal contact .
we'd obviously like to get them on the phone ... so we'll monitor all calls in the event that we're successful in doing that .
i understand that our presence here is an imposition on you ... but i need to ask all of you ... to try to be as open with us as you can be .
so if mr. hayes mentioned anything something on his mind , something bothering him any information you can give us , the better off we are .
i want to assure you ... that our first priority is mr. hayes's safety .
in a situation like this , lack of control can be the hardest part .
we're here to get you back some of that control .
hello .
where have you been?
talking to lane .
how is she?
we spent most of the time discussing the color of what's in oscar's diapers .
hope the f. b. i. found it interesting .
how's mom?
she's okay .
i think she thought he left her .
did she tell you that?
no .
of course not .
he would never do that .
why not?
'cause he'd be lost without her .
he might think about it , but he'd never do it .
uh , most kidnappings in this country are small in scale usually over disagreements about drugs .
they usually work themselves out .
someone pays the bill , and on they go .
we're free .
we'll be on our way in five minutes .
everything's fine .
put those on , please .
sit down .
all the way .
put your butt down .
straighten your legs .
hold it a minute .
hold it .
your hands will be better in front .
do you mind?
doyou mind if i take off my coat first?
a little hot in the trunk .
okay .
okay .
okay .
hands in front .
all right?
let's get going .
oh .
mm .
oh , no .
please , please sit down .
thanks .
pepsi for breakfast?
one of those bad habits .
everything will be paid for by the bureau , by the way .
i don't know if that was explained to you .
oh , no .
that that's all right .
you have a wonderful place here .
yes .
we built it about five no , six years ago .
hmm .
i hope we're not getting in your way too much .
no .
i think we'll be all right .
good .
well , enjoy your breakfast .
thank you .
it's good once you're in .
it's cold .
keeps you young .
ahh .
you know , i can't remember the last time we swam together .
yeah .
it's been a while .
cigarette?
i quit .
but under the circumstances
the shoes all right?
i mean , they fit okay?
yeah .
they're they're fine .
no , no .
those things are killers .
i've been telling my wife that for years , but somehow
are we gonna have a conversation now?
is that it?
okay .
i don't need to talk .
what made you think i smoked?
look , arnold .
how much are we talking about here?
i could call my lawyer , whatever it is .
can't do it .
this has nothing to do with me .
i'm just doing my part .
what what is your part?
i'm doing it .
this is my part .
did you take the pictures?
no .
i'm not a photographer .
we should really get going .
we got a long way to go .
mind telling me where that is?
i'm sorry .
i can't .
mind telling me where that is?
i'm sorry .
i can't .
were there any disagreements that you can remember off hand?
with former employees , any unpleasant departures , grudges ... someone who may feel they were owed something?
anything like that?
no .
not that i know of .
as i understand it , there was some anger over your husband's use of foreign automobiles?
oh , that was just a few letters .
that was all .
hmm .
about a year after he sold primary control in the car rental business ... he resigned from the board and formed a new company .
is that right?
that's right .
a consulting firm?
yes .
but it wasn't successful .
no .
so he's been advisory director at lennox stuart ... for the past two years since he closed the consulting firm?
that's right .
do you know a miss louise miller ... formerly in the employment of your husband at lennox stuart?
yes .
my husband had an affair with her .
and she left your husband's employment in j une of 2001?
i told him to let her go .
oh .
and as far as you know , that was the end of the relationship?
yes , as far as i know .
your husband's phone records indicate ... that they were in regular contact beyond that date .
is that all?
sure .
that's it for now .
thankyou .
my children don't know about this .
i'd appreciate it if you didn't tell them .
i understand .
ham or tuna?
ham .
we'll split it .
thank you .
you know , arnold , i think you may have the wrong man .
oh , yeah?
yeah .
i think you want my neighbor mr. shipley .
he's loaded .
you think i made a mistake?
happens all the time .
perfectly intelligent people pick up a wrong bag at the airport ...
get into a car that doesn't belong to them  i know all about you .
the man hertz and avis are afraid of .
oh , i see .
you grew up in altoona .
you married your high school sweetheart .
you won a scholarship to penn state .
you had a good job , but you quit to start a car rental business .
didn't make sense at the time , but you made it work .
in those days , the greatest challenge was keeping your marriage together .
they wrote that .
i didn't say it .
you like to watch the pirates .
you have a little house on a lake in the woods ... a small boat in which you like to float on summer afternoons to clear your mind ... and two children a son and daughter all grown up now .
that about sums it up .
so , when did you lose your job?
i guess it's obvious , huh?
eight years ago in november .
and what did you do?
i was a manager ofsorts .
and you thought if you were hardworking and loyal ... and did everything they told you to do that you'd be safe , right?
i worked there 17 years .
out of their hands , they said .
well , it probably was .
that's what they said .
changing economy .
gotta keep things profitable .
i've heard it all .
nothing personal .
yeah , right .
it's a terrible thing .
a lot of good people lost their jobs .
i'd say 30 % of our workforce at one point was from hadley .
you could have come work for us .
i'd appreciate it if you didn't condescend me , wayne .
i know how the world works .
that's why i'm out here with you .
so , what does your wife think about this plan?
my wife?
yeah .
those are her cigarettes .
you can keep things from your wife .
i don't know .
what?
you've never deceived your wife?
well , there are levels of deception , arnold .
i mean , this is a whopper .
oh .
well , how about you?
me?
yeah .
you know everything about me .
tell me about yourself .
all right .
uh ...
i have a wife and two daughters .
one of my daughters supposedly lives with us .
she's got some boyfriend .
i think he's a mute .
i can't tell you the last time i saw her .
my wife ... is trying to kill herself with cigarettes .
we live with her father .
he sleeps in the den .
he has his own tv , but he's hard of hearing ... and he doesn't like to wear his hearing aids at night .
so he lies in bed and plays it so loud , we can hear it in our room .
sometimes he leaves it on all night .
but what can i say?
it's his house .
i don't say anything much at all , wayne .
it's a household of ... disappointed people .
but ... we have our health , and we have each other , so
ah , everybody suffers .
isn't that right?
yeah , everybody suffers .
did you always have that mustache?
so long as i could grow one .
this is wayne .
eileen , i'm fine .
our profilers believe the letters are probably being written by one person male , some college education , white , over 30 but we do believe we're dealing with a group .
to keep a hostage for a prolonged period requires multiple participants .
why haven't they asked for anything?
they're showing you who's in control .
i'd like to suggest a different approach .
they've made no acknowledgement of our request to communicate over the phone ... so i propose we place a personal ad ... confirming you received the recording as requested ... but we also claim you received a ransom demand .
you're willing to pay .
you just want to make sure you're paying the right people .
as soon as they think you're gonna give their money to someone else ... they usually call within 24 hours .
okay , so we're agreed .
we do what fuller says .
well , i'm not gonna make this decision alone .
you're not alone , sweetheart .
where are you going?
i'm going to get something for oscar .
you're going shopping?
it's his first birthday .
it's important we celebrate it .
are you coming?
oscar !
is he asleep?
finally .
he woke up the minute i put him down .
wayne will be sorry to have missed it .
yeah .
he loves birthdays .
you know , lane , for my first birthday after wayne and i were married ... he wanted to give me a surprise , so we drove up to this little hotel in the mountains .
we could not afford it , but he insisted , as usual .
anyway , when we got there , they'd never heard of us .
he messed up the reservations or something .
anyway , he was devastated , so he oh , he pleaded .
and then he tried to sound important , but they took no pity on us .
poor dad .
so anyway , we finished up at an all night diner ... because there were no hotel rooms available .
but he made them put candles in everything we ate in the rice pudding , in the in the hamburgers .
and they all sang " happy birthday . " it was great .
i remember once , he convinced me that it was a special birthday treat ... to go to work with him and help him clean the cars .
i fell for that too .
you loved it .
both of you .
he really made you feel like you were the center of the world .
i hope oscar gets to feel that .
he will .
hold it .
is this where we meet the others?
no .
what then?
just a break .
you can sit over there .
oh , yeah .
may i see the pictures of my wife?
what for?
may i see them?
she'd hate the idea of being watched .
she's self conscious , even with me .
she's beautiful .
you know what i think?
what?
i don't think there's anybody watching my wife .
and do you know what that means?
no .
it means i'm gonna have to give you the slip .
you won't wanna do that , wayne .
you'd get me into a world of trouble .
i'd be sorry about that .
anyway , your wife will pay , and then you can go home .
as long as she wants you back .
you haven't done anything terrible , have you?
i've never pointed a gun at anyone .
does your wife know about the company you keep?
that woman?
i told you i know all about you .
i followed you there once .
i sat outside .
you followed me?
they asked me to .
i'd say that's a whopper , wayne .
isn't that a whopper?
we should get going .
oh , this is a beautiful spot , arnold .
you picked a great day for it .
i didn't pick it .
let's go , wayne .
i love my wife , arnold .
we have two beautiful kids , and i'm just getting to know them .
for most of their lives , i've been working .
i missed a lot .
i'm not suggesting you didn't love them .
come on .
let's go .
no .
come on .
this will do just fine .
tell me where we're going .
let's go .
look at yourself .
you've lost your job .
you go around pushing people into trunks
get up .
what if everybody did that?
you goddamn lunatic .
how many times have you fired that gun , arnold?
there's a hunting cabin near the top .
i'm gonna drop you off .
then i go .
that's it .
there's some guys waiting for you .
i work for them .
they're okay .
i wish i'd paid better attention , but i was mowing the lawn .
all i remember is , he wasn't a gardener .
he was white , middle aged , i guess .
he was wearing a suit , i think ... and he was standing at the side of the car talking to mr. hayes .
a driver from one of the local bus routes remembers a man of similar description .
we've come up with a composite sketch based on those descriptions .
here you go .
does that resemble anyone you might know?
yeah , it resembles a million people i might know .
what about the personal ad?
there's still no response .
as they have so far refused to make phone contact , with your permission ...
i would like to demand an assurance of mr. hayes's safety .
i think an organization as disciplined as this would expect such a demand .
wait a minute .
mr. fuller , at your suggestion ... we threatened to give their money to someone else .
and since then , they haven't contacted us .
they've made no demand .
if anything , we're further from resolving this than we were to begin with !
what difference does it make who was on the goddamn bus?
you know what i think?
i think you don't have the faintest fucking idea who those people are !
so , what would you consider an assurance?
a phone conversation .
if they're not willing to confirm your husband's safety ...
i think we should consider the negotiation over .
come here .
mrs. hayes , if they can make you desperate ... they know you'll give them anything they want .
i want to apologize for my son .
that's not necessary .
please , sit down .
you know , it's strange .
you've never met my husband , but you know all about him .
i'm i'm used to it .
you'd like him .
he inspires confidence .
it's his great talent .
a man like that needs to be appreciated .
it gets worse as they get older .
they feel themselves being forgotten .
you don't have to explain anything to me
i'm trying to explain my husband , mr. fuller .
did you tell my son about that woman?
i asked him to look over some phone records .
i don't know what conclusions he came up with .
you said you wouldn't .
i said that i understood .
how would it be if i looked into your marriage?
it wouldn't look very good at the moment .
what are you doing?
i was ... thinking about dad .
i'm frightened i'm never gonna see him again .
what would you say to him if you could?
that i love him .
you know ... when i told him that i was pregnant with you ... that's the only time i've ever seen him cry .
he knows you love him .
these guys waiting for us have i done something to them?
no .
and you you seem to know a lot about me .
have i done something to you?
no , you haven't done anything to me .
you're good with names .
you're famous for it , you know?
i read somebody can meetyou once ... and you see them again 10 years later ... and you greet them as if you saw them every day of your life .
that way , you manage to make each and every person feel important .
fortune magazine .
to be honest , i'm not surprised you don't remember me .
give me a minute .
i started at hadley a few months before you left .
one day i was walking down the hallway .
you were walking the other way .
the man i was with pointed you out and said , " that's the guy to watch .
we met in the cafeteria a few days later .
i introduced myself .
we talked for a while , actually .
i wanted to see what the hotshot was like .
that was a stressful period in my life .
you can't blame me for not remembering .
you were very gracious .
don't worry .
you bought me a cup of coffee , and we talked .
i think actually we saw eye to eye on quite a few things .
i think you might've enjoyed talking with someone of like mind for once .
and you kept up with me?
in the papers?
like the man said , i watched you .
like the man said .
and that's it?
that's why it's me?
let's go , wayne .
i worked hard my whole life .
everything i've got i've earned .
nobody handed it to me .
i don't deserve this .
what
you all right?
i think that was my wife .
i have something for that .
here .
i i'm sorry .
i didn't mean to hurt you .
so , what's the plan when you're done here?
i'm going away .
some place hot?
that's right .
i'm taking my wife away from here .
get back to the way you were?
that's right .
i see .
so , she'll go with you?
of course she will .
give up everything for you?
leave her father behind and the kids?
they'll be all right .
she'll miss them .
you can't go back , arnold .
my wife doesn't look at me the way she did 30 years ago .
nothing you can do about that .
is there , um , any news about wayne?
no .
you know , the f. b. i. came to , um to speak to me .
i don't know how anyone could be so cruel .
when did you see him last?
it was a while ago .
i didn't i didn't know he'd started seeing you again .
i'm sorry .
what was it like when he was here?
i want to know .
did he bring you things?
were you in bed?
sometimes he'd he'd bring me things .
what things?
he brought me that book .
he hates new york .
oh .
i've never been .
you know , when i left the company ... he helped me with this place .
and then he just started coming around now and then ... you know , to see how i was .
we were here for each other .
i think i'd prefer if you'd been fucking in hotels .
you know , eileen ...
i don't know what i would've done without him .
he's a great man .
i went to see her .
i know .
you know , i never talked to him about it .
i never asked him why .
i just told him to get rid of her , and we got on with our life .
i i didn't want to know .
i love him , and she admires him .
they may allow your husband to watch the news .
fuck .
what are you doing?
i'm tired , arnold .
there's a stream up ahead .
you can soak your feet in the water .
it'll feel good .
how long you been married?
twenty four years .
she stood by you?
yes .
you're a lucky man .
would you do something for me?
would you mail a letter for me , to my wife?
you could mail it when you go home .
i might not get along too well with the guys at the cabin ... and i'd like to tell her something .
you can do that for me .
oh , shit .
would you
please , could you cut me free?
you can read what i write .
i won't say anything about you or where we are .
be careful where you mail it ... so they can't trace the postmark .
after we were married andshe was pregnant with tim ... she sometimes had this feeling when i would walk out of a room ...
like maybe i wasn't coming back .
i traveled a lot with the businesses then and
i think she got over it .
i don't
i don't think she suffered much .
when i asked her to marry me ...
i wasn't completely sure .
i had my doubts .
but i
i couldn't imagine my life without her .
that's never changed .
i think that's the same ... as being sure .
you think?
i don't know .
i think it is .
we can go now .
we have a demand .
do you recognize these?
the demand comes to approximately $10 million .
they've requested that you , eileen , deliver the ransom .
it's 9 . 5 in diamonds , two carat , round d flawless .
they're the most common stones in the market , easy for them to move .
and half a million in cash , nonsequential $100 bills .
why do they want my mother to go?
we can't send an agent in her place .
they know what she looks like .
they've requested that we put the ransom in wayne's sports bag .
the lining's too thin for us to put in a tracking device of any range .
i have to advise you not to pay the ransom ... without confirmation that your husband is all right .
eileen , they've given us three days to get the stones together .
tell them you need more time .
tell them you need proof that your husband is alive .
do you know how you do something ... completely beyond the realm of your normal behavior?
how?
you imagine it , every piece ofit ... until it feels real , like something you do all the time .
i wasn't nervous this morning .
it was like driving to work .
the sky , the weather i knew what it was gonna be ... even before i opened my eyes .
they offered me money , real money .
and all i have to do is bring you to them .
tell me , wayne ... if you were in my shoes , wouldn't you do it?
no , i wouldn't .
you have any idea what it's like to see your wife go to work every day ... instead of float in her pool?
no , i don't .
well , it stinks , wayne .
it stinks seeing your life fall apart .
everything you planned for , everything you counted on ... to see it happen in front of you and not be able to do anything about it ... as if you'd become invisible .
you don't know what i'm talking about , do you?
do you?
my mother was sick when i was growin 'up .
father worked in a mill just like everybody else .
he should have done something else with his life ... but he ... accepted his place in the world .
people would come around and try to get him to settle their arguments .
whatever the argument ... he was above it .
he knew everything .
it's a nice story , wayne .
hey , goddamn it , listen to me !
i listened to you .
when he got sick ... they'd come around the house , stand by the bed ... and try to brighten his mood .
and after he died ... they raised a glass to him , came by the house , see if they could help .
and even though he was dead ... it was like he ... hung around .
now , all of a sudden , he really was dead .
he might not have lived for anybody , except my sick mother and me .
just the two of us .
but we missed him .
really missed him .
i don't know that i've even got that .
so all you have to do is just take me to them .
do you think they're gonna let me go once they know i've seen your face?
and what do you think they're gonna do about you?
they're gonna let you go?
it'll be all right , wayne .
no , it won't .
no , it won't .
you don't understand , wayne .
i understand .
look at you .
you don't even have any shoes on .
i understand there's plenty of people like you .
you think this is for your wife?
you think if you steal my money ... go away to a beach someplace , your life won't be such a goddamn waste .
this is for you , arnold .
and this is what you amount to .
because the truth is you can't make it yourself .
and to think that my family is gonna suffer because of you .
you're a piece of shit !
you're a miserable piece of shit .
you have no right to speak to me like that .
shut up .
just take me towhoever it is you work for .
i'm done with you .
this is your final chance .
thursday , 1 : 00 p . m .
the exact location will appear in a personal ad on the day of the drop .
do not involve the f. b. i.
what is it?
it's blood .
let's get this to the lab for analysis .
can you grab some evidence bags?
according to the lab report , the white blood cells in wayne's blood ... have begun to expand to an unsafe size .
what does that mean?
it's not a conclusive indication that wayne is alive .
