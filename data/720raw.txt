# oh , i come from a land from a faraway place #

ah , salaam , and good evening to you , worthy friend .
please , please , come closer .
t oo close .
a little too close .
there .
welcome to agrabah , city of mystery , of enchantment , and the finest merchandise this side of the river jordan , on sale today .
look at this .
yes .
combination hookah and coffeemaker .
also makes julienne fries .
will not break .
will not ...
it broke .
ohh !
look at this .
i have never seen one of these intact before .
this is the famous dead sea tupperware .
listen .
ah , still good .
wait .
don't go .
i can see that you're only interested in the exceptionally rare .
i think , then , you would be most rewarded to consider this .
do not be fooled by its commonplace appearance .
like so many things , it is not what is outside , but what is inside that counts .
this is no ordinary lamp .
it once changed the course of a young man's life .
a young man who , like this lamp , was more than what he seemed .
the diamond in the rough .
perhaps you would like to hear the tale?
it begins on a dark night ... where a dark man waits with a dark purpose .
you are late .
a thousand apologies , o patient one .
you have it then?
i had to slit a few throats , but i got it .
ah ah ahhh .
the treasure .
ow !
trust me , my pungent friend .
you'll get what's coming to you .
what's coming to you .
awk !
quickly !
follow the trail .
faster .
at last , after all my years of searching ... the cave of wonders .
awk .
cave of wonders .
by allah .
now , remember .
bring me the lamp .
the rest of the treasure is yours , but the lamp is mine .
awk , the lamp .
awk , the lamp .
jeez , where'd ya dig this bozo up?
shh .
who disturbs my slumber?
it is i , gazeem , a humble thief .
know this .
only one may enter here , one whose worth lies far within .
a diamond in the rough .
what are you waiting for# go on .
no !
seek thee out the diamond in the rough .
i can't believe it .
i just don't believe it .
we're never gonna get a hold of that stupid lamp .
just forget it .
look at this .
i'm so ticked off that i'm molting .
patience , lago .
patience .
gazeem was obviously less than worthy .
oh , there's a big surprise .
i think i'm gonna have a heart attack and die from that surprise .
what are we gonna do?
we got a big problem here , a big ...
yes .
only one may enter .
i must find this one , this ... diamond in the rough .
stop !
thief !
stop !
thief !
i'll have your hands for a trophy , street rat .
all this for a loaf of bread?
whoa !
there he is !
you won't get away so easy !
you think that was easy?
you two , over that way , and you , follow me .
we'll find him .
morning , ladies .
getting into trouble a little early today , aren't we , aladdin?
trouble# no way .
you're only in trouble if you get caught .
gotcha .
i'm in trouble .
and this time ... [ monkey squeaking ]
perfect timing , abu , as usual .
abu .
come on .
let's get outta here .
# gotta keep one jump ahead of the bread line #
# one swing ahead of the sword #
# i steal only what i can't afford #
that's everything .
# one jump ahead of the lawmen #
# that's all and that's no joke #
# these guys don't appreciate i'm broke #
riffraff .
street rat .
scoundrel .
t ake that .
# just a little snack , guys #
# rip him open take it back , guys #
# i can take a hint gotta face the facts #
# you're my only friend , abu # [ women ]
who?
# oh , it's sad aladdin's hit the bottom #
# he's become a one man rise in crime #
# i'd blame parents except he hasn't got 'em #
# gotta eat to live gotta steal to eat #
# tell you all about it when i got the time #
# one jump ahead of the slowpokes one skip ahead of my doom #
# next time gonna use a nom de plume #
there he is .
# one jump ahead of the hit men one hit ahead of the flock #
# i think i'll take a stroll around the block #
stop , thief .
vandal .
abu !
scandal .
# let's not be too hasty #
# still i think he's rather tasty #
# gotta eat to live gotta steal to eat #
# otherwise we'd get along # [ guards ]
wrong .
get him !
he's got a sword !
you idiots .
we've all got swords .
# one jump ahead of the hoofbeats # vandal ! # one hop ahead of the hump # street rat ! # one trick ahead of disaster # scoundrel !
# they're quick , but i'm much faster #
# here goes , better throw my hand in #
# wish me happy landin 'all i gotta do is jump # [ screaming ]
yuck !
oy !
and now , esteemed effendi , we feast .
and now , esteemed effendi , we feast .
all right .
yum , yum !
uh oh .
here .
go on .
take it .
ah , don't .
huh?
on his way to the palace , i suppose .
another suitor for the princess .
out of my way , you filthy brats .
hey !
if i were as rich as you , i could afford some manners .
oh .
i'll teach you some manners .
look at that , abu .
it's not every day you see a horse with two rear ends .
ooh !
you are a worthless street rat .
you were born a street rat , you'll die a street rat , and only your fleas will mourn you .
i'm not worthless .
and i don't have fleas .
come on , abu .
let's go home .
# riffraff , street rat #
# i don't buy that #
# if only they'd look closer #
# would they see a poor boy #
# no , siree #
# they'd find out #
# there's so much more #
# to me #
some day , abu , things are gonna change .
we'll be rich , live in a palace , and never have any problems at all .
i've never been so insulted .
oh , prince achmed .
you're not leaving so soon , are you?
good luck marrying her off .
oh !
jasmine .
jasmine !
jasmine !
jasmine !
confound it , rajah .
so , this is why prince achmed stormed out .
oh , father .
rajah was just playing with him .
weren't you , rajah?
you were just playing with that overdressed , self absorbed prince achmed , weren't you?
dearest , you've got to stop rejecting every suitor who comes to call .
the law says you must be married to a prince ... by your next birthday .
the law is wrong .
you've only got three more days .
father , i hate being forced into this .
if i do marry , i want it to be for love .
jasmine ... it's not only this law .
i'm not going to be around forever , and , well , i ...
i just want to make sure you're taken care of .
provided for .
please try to understand .
i've never done a thing on my own .
i've never had any real friends .
except you , rajah .
i've never even been outside the palace walls .
but , jasmine , you're a princess .
then maybe i don't want to be a princess anymore .
oooh !
i ...
i ...
allah forbid you should have any daughters .
hmm?
i don't know where she gets it from .
her mother wasn't nearly so picky .
oh !
ah , jafar .
my most trusted advisor .
i am in desperate need of your wisdom .
my life is but to serve you , my lord .
it's this suitor business .
jasmine refuses to choose a husband .
i'm at my wit's end .
awk !
wit's end !
oh !
have a cracker , pretty polly .
your majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals .
now , then , perhaps i can divine a solution to this thorny problem .
if anyone can help , it's you .
but it would require the use of the mystic blue diamond .
oh .
uh , my ring?
but it's been in the family for years .
it is necessary to find the princess a suitor .
don't worry .
everything will be fine .
everything will be ... fine .
the diamond .
here , jafar .
whatever you need will be fine .
you are most gracious , my liege .
now , run along and play with your little toys , hmm?
yes .
that will be pretty good .
i can't take it anymore !
if i gotta choke down on one more of those moldy , disgusting crackers ...
bam !
whack !
calm yourself , lago .
then i'd grab him around the head .
whack !
soon i will be sultan , not that addle pated twit .
and then i stuff the crackers down his throat .
ha , ha !
oh , i'm sorry , rajah .
but i can't stay here and have my life lived for me .
i'll miss you .
goodbye .
okay , abu .
go .
try this .
your taste buds will dance and sing .
get your paws off that .
why , you ...
get away from here , you cursed , filthy ape !
goodbye .
nice going , abu .
breakfast is served .
pretty lady , buy a pot .
no finer pot in brass or silver .
sugar dates .
sugar dates and figs .
sugar dates and pistachios .
would the lady like a necklace?
a pretty necklace for a pretty lady .
fresh fish !
we catch 'em , you buy 'em !
oh , no .
i don't think so .
oh !
excuse me .
i'm really very sorry .
wow .
uh oh .
hello# hello?
oh , you must be hungry .
here you go .
you'd better be able to pay for that .
pay?
no one steals from my cart .
oh , i'm sorry , sir .
i don't have any money .
thief !
please ...
if you let me go to the palace , i can get some from the sultan .
do you know what the penalty is for stealing?
no !
no , please !
thank you , kind sir .
i'm so glad you found her .
i've been looking all over for you .
what are you doing?
just play along .
you , uh , know this girl?
sadly , yes .
she is my sister .
she's a little crazy .
she said she knew the sultan .
she thinks the monkey is the sultan .
o wise sultan , how may i serve you?
tragic , isn't it?
but no harm done .
now , come along , sis .
time to go see the doctor .
oh , hello , doctor .
how are you?
no , no , no .
not that one .
come on , sultan .
huh# what?
come back here , you little thieves !
with all due respect , your rottenness , couldn't we just wait for a real storm?
save your breath , lago .
faster .
yes , o mighty evil one .
part , sands of time .
reveal to me the one who can enter the cave .
yes !
yes !
there he is .
my diamond in the rough .
that's him# that's the clown we've been waitin 'for?
let's have the guards extend him an invitation to the palace , shall we?
swell .
almost there .
i want to thank you for stopping that man .
uh , forget it .
so , this is your first time in the marketplace , huh?
is it that obvious?
well , you do kind of stand out .
i mean , uh , you don't seem to know how dangerous agrabah can be .
hmm .
i'm a fast learner .
wow .
hey .
come on .
this way .
whoa .
watch your head there .
be careful .
is this where you live?
yep .
just me and abu .
come and go as we please .
that sounds fabulous .
well , it's not much , but it's got a great view .
wow .
the palace looks pretty amazing , huh?
oh , it's wonderful .
i wonder what it would be like to live there , and have servants and valets .
oh , sure .
people who tell you where to go and how to dress .
it's better than here .
you're always scraping for food and ducking the guards .
you're not free to make your own choices .
sometimes you feel so ...
you're just ... [ both ] ... trapped .
so , where are you from?
what does it matter?
i ran away and i am not going back .
really# how come?
why , you ...
my father's forcing me to get married .
that's ... that's awful .
abu !
what?
abu says , uh ... that's not fair .
what?
oh , did he?
yeah , of course .
and does abu have anything else to say?
well , uh , he wishes there was something he could do to help .
oh , boy .
hmm .
tell him that's very sweet .
here you are .
they're after me !
you?
my father must have sent them ...
do you trust me?
what?
do you trust me?
yes ...
then jump !
we just keep running into each other , don't we , street rat?
run !
go !
get out of here !
get this thing off of me !
it's the dungeon for you , boy .
get off of me .
let him go .
looky here , men .
a street mouse .
unhand him , by order of the princess .
princess jasmine .
the princess?
princess?
what are you doing outside the palace?
and with this street rat .
that's not your concern .
do as i command .
release him .
i would , princess , except my orders come from jafar .
you'll have to take it up with him .
believe me , i will .
jafar?
oh , princess .
awk !
jafar , i'm stuck .
how may i be of service to you?
the guards just took a boy from the market , on your orders .
your father has charged me with keeping peace in agrabah .
the boy was a criminal .
what was his crime?
i can't breathe , jafar .
why , kidnapping the princess , of course .
if you could just ...
aah !
that hurt !
he didn't kidnap me .
i ran away .
oh , dear .
oh , how frightfully upsetting .
had i but known ...
what do you mean?
sadly , the boy's sentence has already been carried out .
what sentence?
death .
by beheading .
no .
i am exceedingly sorry , princess .
how could you?
so , how did it go?
i think she took it ... rather well .
it's all my fault , rajah .
i didn't even know his name .
she was the princess .
i can't believe it .
i must have sounded so stupid to her .
yoo hoo !
aladdin !
hello !
abu .
down here .
come on , help me out of these .
hey , she was in trouble .
ah , she was worth it .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
don't worry .
i'll never see her again .
i'm a street rat , remember?
and there's a law .
she's gotta marry a prince .
she deserves a prince .
ta da !
i'm a fool .
you're only a fool if you give up , boy .
who are you?
a lowly prisoner , like yourself .
but together , perhaps we can be more .
i'm listening .
there is a cave , boy , a cave of wonders , filled with treasures beyond your wildest dreams .
ooh !
treasure enough to impress even your princess , i'd wager .
jafar , can you hurry up?
i'm dyin 'in here .
but the law says only a prince can ...
you've heard of the golden rule , haven't you?
whoever has the gold makes the rules .
why would you share all of this wonderful treasure with me?
i need a young pair of legs and a strong back to go in after it .
uh , one problem .
it's out there .
we're in here .
uh uh .
things aren't always what they seem .
so ... do we have a deal?
oh , i don't know .
who disturbs my slumber?
uh , it is i , aladdin .
proceed .
touch nothing but the lamp .
remember , boy , first fetch me the lamp , and then you shall have your reward .
come on , abu .
would you look at that !
just a handful of this stuff would make me richer than the sultan .
abu !
don't ... touch ... anything .
we gotta find that lamp .
huh?
aladdin !
abu , will you knock it off?
abu , what are you , crazy?
a magic carpet .
come on .
come on out .
we're not gonna hurt you .
hey , take it easy , abu .
he's not gonna bite .
thanks .
wait a minute .
don't go .
maybe you can help us .
hey !
whoa !
you see , we're trying to find this lamp .
i think he knows where it is .
wait here .
oh !
this is it?
this is what we came all the way down here to ...
abu !
no !
uh oh .
you have touched the forbidden treasure !
now you will never again see the light of day !
whoa !
help !
help !
help !
gotcha !
carpet , let's move .
abu !
abu , this is no time to panic .
start panicking .
whoa !
help me out .
throw me the lamp .
i can't hold on .
give me your hand .
first give me the lamp .
yes !
at last !
what are you doing?
giving you your reward .
your eternal reward .
it's mine .
it's all mine .
i ... where is it?
no .
no !
jasmine?
oh , dearest .
what's wrong?
jafar has ... done something terrible .
there , there , my dear .
we'll set it right .
now , tell me everything .
oh .
aladdin .
wake up .
aladdin .
oh !
my head .
we're trapped .
that two faced son of a jackal !
whoever he was , he's long gone with that lamp .
aha !
why , you hairy little thief .
looks like such a beat up , worthless piece of junk .
hey , i think there's something written here , but it's hard to make out .
aaaaahhhhh !
oy !
1 0, 000 years will give you such a crick in the neck .
hang on a second .
whoa !
whoa !
does it feel good to be outta there .
nice to be back , ladies and gentlemen .
hi .
where you from?
what's your name?
uh ...
uh , aladdin .
aladdin .
hello , aladdin .
nice to have you on the show .
can we call you " al "?
or maybe just " din .
how about " laddie "?
sounds like , " here , boy .
c'mon , laddie .
i must have hit my head harder than i thought .
do you smoke# mind if i do?
oh , sorry , cheetah .
hope i didn't singe the fur .
yo , rugman .
haven't seen you in a few millennia .
give me some tass el .
yeah .
yo , yo .
say , you're a lot smaller than my last master .
that or i'm gettin 'bigger .
look from the side .
do i look different?
wait a minute .
i'm your master?
that's right .
he can be taught .
what would you wish of me?
the ever impressive , the long contained , often imitated , but never duplicated ... [ echoing ]
duplicated , duplicated ...
genie ... of the lamp !
right here direct from the lamp , right here for your very much wish fulfillment .
thank you .
whoa .
wish fulfillment?
three wishes to be exact .
and ix nay on the wishing for more wishes .
that's it .
three .
uno , dos , tres .
no substitutions , exchanges or refunds .
now i know i'm dreaming .
master , i don't think you quite realize what you've got here .
master , i don't think you quite realize what you've got here .
so why don't you just ruminate whilst i illuminate the possibilities .

i can't kill anybody .
so don't ask .
rule number two .
i can't make anybody fall in love with anybody else .
you little punim there .
rule number three .
i can't bring people back from the dead .
it's not a pretty picture .
i don't like doing it .
other than that , you got it .
hmm .
oh !
provisos?
you mean limitations?
on wishes?
some all powerful genie .
can't even bring people back from the dead .
i don't know , abu .
he probably can't even get us out of this cave .
looks like we're gonna have to find a way out .
excuse me?
are you lookin 'at me?
did you rub my lamp?
did you wake me up?
did you bring me here?
and you're walking out on me?
i don't think so , not right now .
you're gettin 'your wishes , so sit down !
in case of emergency , the exits are here , here , here , here , anywhere .
keep your hands and arms inside the carpet .
we're ... outta here !
jafar , this is an outrage .
jafar , this is an outrage .
if it weren't for all your years of loyal service ...
from now on , you are to discuss sentencing of prisoners with me , before they are beheaded .
i assure you , your highness , it won't happen again .
jasmine ...
jafar .
let's put this whole messy business behind us .
please .
my most abject and humblest apologies to you as well , princess .
at least some good will come of my being forced to marry .
when i am queen , i will have the power to get rid of you .
that's nice .
all settled , then .
now , jasmine , getting back to this suitor business ...
jasmine?
jasmine !
if only i had gotten that lamp .
i will have the power to get rid of you .
to think we gotta keep kissing up to that chump and his chump daughter
for the rest of our lives ...
no , lago .
only until she finds a chump husband .
then she'll have us banished .
or beheaded .
eww !
oh .
wait a minute .
jafar .
what if you were the chump husband?
what?
okay , you marry the princess , all right?
and , uh , then you become the sultan .
oh .
marry the shrew .
i become the sultan .
the idea has merit .
yes , merit .
yes .
and then we drop papa in law and the little woman off a cliff .
yaaah !
kersplat !
i love the way your foul little mind works .
thank you for choosing magic carpet for all your travel needs .
don't stand until the rug has come to a complete stop .

oh , you sure showed me .
now , about my three wishes .
dost mine ears deceive me?
three# you are down by one , boy .
ah , no .
i never actually wished to get out of the cave .
you did that on your own .
well , i feel sheepish .
all right , you baaad boy , but no more freebies .
fair deal .
so , three wishes .
i want them to be good .
what would you wish for?
me?
no one's ever asked me that before .
well , in my case ...
ah , forget it .
what?
no , i can't .
i ...
come on .
tell me .
freedom .
you're a prisoner?
it's all part and parcel of the whole genie gig .
phenomenal cosmic powers ...
itty bitty living space .
genie , that's terrible .
but , oh , to be free .
not have to go , " poof .
what do you need?
poof .
what do you need?
poof .
what do you need?
to be my own master .
such a thing would be greater than all the magic and all the treasures in all the world .
but what am i talking about?
let's get real here .
it's not gonna happen .
genie , wake up and smell the hummus .
why not?
the only way i get outta this is if my master wishes me out .
so you can guess how often that's happened .
i'll do it .
i'll set you free .
uh huh , yeah , right .
no , really , i promise . after i make my first two wishes ,
i'll use my third wish to set you free .
well , here's hopin '.
all right .
let's make some magic .
so how 'bout it?
what is it you want most?
well , there's this girl .

pretty?
beautiful .
she's got these eyes that just ... and this hair .
wow .
and her smile ... [ sighs ]
ami .
c'est i'amour .
but she's the princess .
to even have a chance , i'd have to be ...
hey , can you make me a prince?
let's see here .
chicken la king# nope .
alaskan king crab .
ow .
i hate it when they do that .
caesar salad .
ah !
et tu , brute# no .
aha .
to make a prince .
is that an official wish?
say the magic words .
genie , i wish for you to make me a prince .
all right !
yo , yo !
woof !

these patches .
what are we trying to say , beggar?
no .

what does it say to me?
it says mode of transportation .
excuse me , monkey boy .
aqui .
over here .
uh oh .

what better way to make your entrance on the streets of agrabah than riding your very own brand new camel .
watch out .
they spit .
mmm .
not enough .
still not enough .
let's see .

awk .
the problem with your daughter .
oh , really?
right here .
lf the princess has not chosen a husband by the appointed time , then the sultan shall choose for her .
but jasmine hated all those suitors .
how could i choose someone she hates?
not to worry , my liege .
there is more .
lf in the event a suitable prince cannot be found ,
jerk . " a princess must then be wed to ...
hmm .
interesting .
what# who?
the royal vizier .
why , that would be ... me .
but i thought the law says that only a prince can marry a princess .
i'm quite sure that ...
desperate times call for desperate measures , my lord .
yes .
desperate measures .
you will order the princess to marry me .
i will order ... the princess ... to ...
but you're so old .
the princess will marry me .
the princess will marry ...

splendid .
absolutely marvelous .
fyour majesty ,
i have journeyed from afar to seek your daughter's hand .
prince ali ababwa .
of course .
i'm delighted to meet you .
this is my royal vizier , jafar .
he's delighted , too .
ecstatic .
i'm afraid , prince abooboo ...
ababwa .
whatever .
you cannot just parade in here uninvited and expect to ...
by allah , this is quite a remarkable device .
ooh .
i don't suppose i might ...
why , certainly , your majesty .
allow me .
sire , i must advise against this .
oh , button up , jafar .
learn to have a little fun .
ow , ow , ow .
ahh !
whoa !
just where did you say you were from?
oh , much farther than you've traveled , i'm sure .
try me .
look out , polly .
hey , watch it .
watch it with the dumb rug .
aah !
whew !
out of the way .
i'm coming in to land .
jafar , watch this .
spectacular , your highness .
that was lovely .
yes , i do seem to have a knack for it .
this is a very impressive youth .
and a prince besides .
if we're lucky , you won't have to marry jasmine after all .
i don't trust him , sire .
nonsense .
one thing i pride myself on , jafar ,
i'm an excellent judge of character .
oh , excellent judge .
yeah , sure .
not !
jasmine will like this one .
and i'm pretty sure i'll like princess jasmine .
your highness , no .
i must intercede on jasmine's behalf .
this boy is no different from the others .
what makes him think he is worthy of the princess?
your majesty , i am prince ali ababwa .
just let her meet me .
i will win your daughter .
how dare you .
all of you .
standing around deciding my future?
i am not a prize to be won .
oh , dear .
don't worry , prince ali .
just give jasmine time to cool down .
i think it's time to say good bye to prince abooboo .
what am i gonna do?
jasmine won't even let me talk to her .
i should've known i couldn't pull off this stupid prince wish .
so move .
hey .
that's a good move .
i can't believe it .
i'm losing to a rug .
genie , i need help .
all right , sparky , here's the deal .
if you wanna court the little lady , you gotta be a straight shooter .
do you got it?
what?
tell her the ...
... truth !
no way .
if jasmine found out i was really some crummy street rat , she'd laugh at me .
a woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh .
al , all joking aside , you really ought to be yourself .
hey , that's the last thing i wanna be .
okay , i'm gonna go see her .
i just ...
i gotta be smooth , cool , confident .
how do i look?
like a prince .
princess jasmine?
who's there?
it's me , prince ali .
ahem .
uh , prince ali ababwa .
i do not want to see you .
no , no , please , princess .
give me a chance .
just leave me alone .
down , kitty .
so , how's our little beau doing?
good kitty , take off .
down , kitty .
wait .
wait .
do i know you?
uh , no .
no .
you remind me of someone i met in the marketplace .
the marketplace?
i have servants who go to the marketplace for me .
why , i even have servants who go to the marketplace for my servants .
it couldn't have been me you met .
no .
i guess not .
enough about you , casanova .
talk about her .
she's smart , fun , the hair , the eyes .
anything .
pick a feature .
ahem .
uh , princess jasmine?
you're very ...
wonderful , magnificent , punctual . ... punctual .
punctual?
sorry .
uh , beautiful .
nice recovery .
hmm .
i'm rich , too , you know .
yeah .
the daughter of a sultan .
i know .
a fine prize for any prince to marry .
uh , right .
right .
a prince like me .
warning !
warning !
right .
a prince like you .
and every other stuffed shirt , swaggering peacock i've met .
mayday !
mayday !
just go jump off a balcony !
what?
stop her .
stop her !
want me to sting her?
buzz off .
okay , fine .
but remember , " bee " yourself .
yeah , right .
what?
uh ...
uh , you're right .
you aren't just some prize to be won .
you should be free to make your own choice .
i'll go now .
no !
what# what?
how ...
how are you doing that?
it's a magic carpet .
it's lovely .
you , uh ...
you , uh ...
you don't want to go for a ride , do you?
we could get out of the palace , see the world .
is it safe?
sure .
do you trust me?
what?
do you trust me?
yes .
yes .
# i can show you the world #
# shining , shimmering , splendid #
# tell me , princess #
# now , when did you last let your heart decide #
# i can open your eyes #
# take you wonder by wonder #
# over , sideways and under #
# on a magic carpet ride #
# a whole new world #
# a new fantastic point of view #
# no one to tell us no or where to go #
# or say we're only dreaming #
# a whole new world #
# a dazzling place i never knew #
# but when i'm way up here it's crystal clear #
# that now i'm in a whole new world with you #
# now i'm in a whole new world with you #
# unbelievable sights #
# indescribable feeling #
# soaring , tumbling , freewheeling #
# through an endless diamond sky #
# a whole new world # # don't you dare close your eyes #
# a hundred thousand things to see # # hold your breath , it gets better #
# i'm like a shooting star i've come so far #
# i can't go back to where i used to be #
# a whole new world # # every turn a surprise #

# that's where we 'll be # # that's where we 'll be #
# a thrilling chase # # a wondrous place #
# for you and me #
it's all so magical .
yeah .
it's all so magical .
yeah .
it's a shame abu had to miss this .
nah .
he hates fireworks .
he doesn't like flying , either .
uh , that is , um ...
oh , no .
you are the boy from the market .
i knew it .
why did you lie?
jasmine , i'm sorry .
did you think i was stupid?
no .
that i wouldn't figure it out?
no .
i mean , i hoped you wouldn't .
no , that's not what i meant .
who are you?
tell me the truth .
the truth?
the truth .
um ...
the truth is ...
i sometimes dress as a commoner , um ... to escape the pressures of palace life .
but i really am a prince .
why didn't you just tell me?
well , you know ... royalty going out into the city in disguise , it sounds a little strange , don't you think?
hmm .
not that strange .
good night , my handsome prince .
sleep well , princess .
yes !
for the first time in my life , things are starting to go right .
abu .
abu .
hold him .
i'm afraid you've worn out your welcome , prince abooboo .
why , you ...
make sure he's never found .
never fails .
get in the bath and there's a rub at the lamp .
hello# al?
al !
kid , snap out of it .
you can't cheat on this one .
i can't help unless you make a wish .
you have to say , " genie , i want you to save my life . " got it?
come on , aladdin !
i'll take that as a yes .
up scope .
don't you scare me like that .
genie , i , uh ...
i ...
thanks , genie .
oh , al .
i'm gettin 'kind of fond of you , kid .
not that i wanna pick out curtains or anything .
jasmine .
oh , father , i just had the most wonderful time .
i'm so happy .
you should be , jasmine .
i have chosen a husband for you .
what?
you will wed jafar .
you're speechless , i see .
a fine quality in a wife .
i will never marry you .
father , i choose prince ali .
prince ali left .
better check your crystal ball again , jafar .
prince ali !
how in the ... uh .
awk !

he is obviously lying .
obviously lying .
father , what's wrong with you?
i know what's wrong .
oh , my !
jafar's been controlling you with this .
what# jafar?
you , you traitor !
your majesty , all this can be explained .
guards !
guards !
well , that's it .
we're dead .
forget it .
just dig a grave for both of us .
we're dead .
arrest jafar at once .
this is not done yet , boy .
find him !
search everywhere !
jasmine , are you all right?
yes .
jafar , my most trusted counselor , plotting against me all this time .
this is horrible , just horrible .
how will i ever ...
huh?
can this be true?
my daughter has finally chosen a suitor?
ha , ha !
praise allah !
you brilliant boy , i could kiss you .
i won't .
i'll leave that to my ...
but you two will be wed at once .
yes , yes .
and you'll be happy and prosperous , and then you , my boy , will become sultan .
sultan?
yes .
a fine upstanding youth such as yourself , a person of your unimpeachable moral character is exactly what this kingdom needs .
we gotta get outta here .
i gotta start packing .
only essentials .
we gotta travel light .
bring the guns , the weapons , and how about this picture?
i think i'm making a weird face in it .
oh , boy .
he's cracked .
he's gone nuts .
jafar !
jafar !
get a grip !
good grip .
prince ali is nothing more than that ragged urchin , aladdin .
he has the lamp , lago .
why , that miserable ...
but you are going to relieve him of it .
me?
sultan?
they want me to be sultan?
huzzah !
# hail the conquering hero # [ # stars and stripes forever plays # ]
aladdin , you've just won the heart of the princess .
what are you gonna do next?
psst .
your line is , " i'm going to free the genie .
anytime .
genie .
i can't .
sure you can .
you just go , " genie , i wish you free .
i'm serious .
look , i'm sorry .
i really am .
but they wanna make me sultan .
no .
they wanna make prince ali sultan .
without you , i'm just aladdin .
al , you won .
because of you .
the only reason anyone thinks i'm worth anything is because of you .
what if they find out i'm not really a prince?
what if jasmine finds out?
i'd lose her .
genie , i can't keep this up on my own .
i can't wish you free .
fine .
i understand .
you've lied to everyone else .
hey , i was beginning to feel left out .
now , if you'll excuse me , master .
genie , i'm really sorry .
well , fine .
then just stay in there .
what are you guys looking at?
look , i ...
i'm sorry .
abu , i'm sorry .
i didn't ...
wait .
come on .
what am i doing?
genie's right .
i gotta tell jasmine the truth .
ali .

hurry .
i'm coming .
you got a problem , pinky?
jerk .
boy , jafar's gonna be happy to see you .
excellent work , lago .
ah , go on .
no , really .
on a scale of one to ten , you are an eleven .
oh , jafar , you're too kind .
i'm embarrassed .
i'm blushing .
people of agrabah , my daughter has finally chosen a suitor .
jasmine .
ali , where have you been?
jasmine , there's something i got to tell you .
the whole kingdom's turned out for father's announcement .
no .
but , jasmine , listen to me , please .
you don't understand ...
good luck .
oh , boy .
look at them , cheering that little pipsqueak .
let them cheer .
let them cheer .
you know , al , i'm getting really ...
i don't think you're him .
tonight , the part of al will be played by a tall , dark and sinister ugly man .
i am your master now .
i was afraid of that .
genie , grant me my first wish .
i wish to rule on high as sultan .
whoa !
bless my soul .
what is this?
what's going on?
oh , my goodness , what's happening?
father .
jafar , you vile betrayer .
that's sultan vile betrayer to you .
oh , yeah?
we'll just see about that .
the lamp .
finders keepers , abooboo .
genie , no !
sorry , kid .
i got a new master now .
jafar , i order you to stop .
ah , but there's a new order now .
my order .
finally , you will bow to me .
we will never bow to you .
why am i not surprised?
if you won't bow before a sultan , then you will cower before a sorcerer !
genie , my second wish ...
i wish to be the most powerful sorcerer in the world !
genie , stop !
ladies and gentlemen , a warm agrabah welcome for sorcerer jafar !
now , where were we?
ah , yes .
abject humiliation .
down , boy .
oh , princess .
there's someone i'm dying to introduce you to .
jafar .
get your hands off her .
# prince ali yes , it is he #
# but not as you know him #
# read my lips and come to grips with reality #
# yes , meet a blast from your past #
# whose lies were too good to last #
# say hello to your precious prince ali #
or should we say aladdin?
ali?
jasmine , i tried to tell you .
i'm just ...
# so ali turns out to be merely aladdin #
# just a con , need i go on #
# take it from me #
# his personality flaws #
# give me adequate cause #
# to send him packing on a one way trip #
# so his prospects take a terminal dip #
# his assets frozen , the venue chosen is the ends of the earth , whoopee ! #
so long !
good bye , see ya .
# ex prince ali #
abu .
abu !
oh , this is all my fault .
i should have freed the genie when i had the chance .
abu .

mm hmm .
i'm sorry , abu .
i made a mess of everything .
somehow ...
i gotta go back and set things right .
carpet .
abu , start digging .
that's it .

let's go .
puppet ruler want a cracker?
here's your cracker .
shoved all the way down your throat .
here .
have lots .
stop it .
jafar , leave him alone .
it pains me to see you reduced to this , jasmine .
a beautiful desert bloom such as yourself should be on the arm of the most powerful man in the world .
what do you say , my dear?
why , with you as my queen ...
never .
i'll teach you some respect .
no .
genie .
i have decided to make my final wish .
i wish for princess jasmine to fall desperately in love with me .
ah , master , there are a few addendas , some quid pro quo ...
don't talk back to me , you big blue lout .
you will do what i order you to do , slave .
jafar .
i never realized how ... incredibly handsome you are .
mmm .
that's better .
now , pussycat ... tell me more about myself .
you're tall ... dark ... well dressed ...
al .
al , little buddy .
shh .
al , i can't help you .
i work for seor psychopath now .
what are you gonna do?
hey , i'm a street rat , remember?
i'll improvise .
go on .
and your beard ... is so ... twisted .
you've stolen my heart .
jaf ... !
and the street rat?
what street rat?
yech !
that was ...

how many times do i have to kill you , boy?
get the lamp .
no !
ah , ah , ah , princess .
your time is up .
jasmine .
oh , nice shot , jaf ...
don't toy with me .
abu !
things are unraveling fast now , boy .
get the point?
i'm just getting warmed up .
are you afraid to fight me yourself , you cowardly snake?
a snake , am l?
a snake , am l?
perhaps you'd like to see how snakelike i can be .
# rick 'em , rack 'em , rock 'em , rake stick that sword into that snake #
you stay out of this .
jafar , jafar , he's our man .
if he can't do it ... great !
aladdin .
jasmine , hang on .
you little fool .
you thought you could defeat the most powerful being on earth .
squeeze him , jafar .
squeeze him like a ...
awk !
without the genie , boy , you're nothing .
the genie .
the genie .
the genie has more power than you'll ever have .
what?
he gave you your power .
he can take it away .
al , what are you doing?
why are you bringing me into this?
face it , jafar .
you're still just second best .
you're right .
his power does exceed my own .
but not for long .
the boy is crazy .
he's a little punch drunk .
one too many hits with the snake .
slave , i make my third wish .
i wish to be an all powerful genie !
all right , your wish is my command .
way to go , al .
yes .
yes !
the power .
the absolute power !
what have you done?
trust me .
the universe is mine to command , to control !
not so fast , jafar .
aren't you forgetting something?
huh?
you wanted to be a genie ... you got it .
what?
and everything that goes with it .
no !
no !
i'm gettin 'out of here .
phenomenal cosmic powers ...
you're the genie .
i don't want ...
itty bitty living space .
al , you little genius , you .
ahh !
get your blasted beak out of my face .
oh , shut up , you moron .
don't tell me to shut up .
allow me .
1 0, 000 years in a cave of wonders ought to chill him out .
shut up !
jasmine ...
i'm sorry i lied to you about being a prince .
i know why you did .
well , i guess ... this is good bye?
oh , that stupid law .
this isn't fair .
i love you .
al , no problem .
you've still got one wish left .
just say the word and you're a prince again .
but , genie , what about your freedom?
hey , it's only an eternity of servitude .
this is love .
al , you're not gonna find another girl like her in a million years .
believe me , i know .
i've looked .
jasmine , i do love you , but i got to stop pretending to be something i'm not .
i understand .
genie , i wish for your freedom .
one bona fide prince pedigree coming up .
what?
genie , you're free .
i'm free .
i'm free .
quick .
quick .
wish for something outrageous .
say , " i want the nile . " try that .
uh , i wish for the nile .
no way !
oh , does that feel good !
oh !
i'm free !
i'm free at last !
i'm hittin 'the road .
i'm off to see the world .
i'm ...
genie , i'm ...
i'm gonna miss you .
me , too , al .
no matter what anybody says , you'll always be a prince to me .
that's right .
you've certainly proven your worth as far as i'm concerned .
it's that law that's the problem .
father?
well , am i sultan or am i sultan?
from this day forth , the princess shall marry whomever she deems worthy .
him .
i choose ...
i choose you , aladdin .
call me al .
oh , all of ya , come over here .
big group hug .
group hug .
mind if i kiss the monkey?
ooh , hairball .
well , i can't do any more damage around this popsicle stand .
i'm outta here !
bye bye , you two crazy lovebirds !
hey , rugman , ciao .
i'm history .
no , i'm mythology .
i don't care what i am .
i'm free !
