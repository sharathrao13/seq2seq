my name is joe .
and i'm going to help you though this thing .
abby !
abby , where are you?
bad idea
good evening .
dr. jennings .
oh , yes , doctor .
may i say that several of our guests have mentioned they are much looking forward to see your presentation tonight .
oh , it's nice to hear .
where is my baby?
wow , you don't want to shoot me , mrs. jennings .
shut up !
where is she?
abby is with my cousin .
my cousin has a celil phone .
if i don't call him every 30 minutes , he is going to kill her , as if you would want him to do
i'd just say that you definitely look prettier than this .
sit down !!
look , mrs. jennings .
nothing's going to happen to abby as long as nothing happens to me .
okay?
you can count on marvin .
he always does what exactly what he's told .
and it's always that's me to tell him .
what do you want?
you are a smart lady .
you pick up things really quickly .
you do .
you see what we have here is a kidnapping for ransom .
but see , it's not just any kidnapping .
it's a perfect kidnapping .
and i know that perfect , because i've done it 4 times before i caught you .
take me to her , you son of a bitch !
i know , i know exactly what you're thinking .
i'll tell you what happened to the other 4 kids .
i want you to know every single one of those kids is right at this moment , watching barney , swimming in the pools , or riding the ponys , or whatever the fuck you have for your rich little kids do .
it's all because i give the parents the power to keep them alive .
if you follow the rules and let me make my cost tomorrow to keep him safe
now , karen .
it's okay .
i'll call him , karen .
you keep that gun if you want .
if it makes you feel any better but i just going to tell you something about the gun , okay?
you'll kill 2 people one for one .
me and abby .
may i?
thanks .
it's a quite a place you got here .
thank you .
we're previleged to have with us tonight a young physician i first met when he was a young irish medical student doing research on disadaptive properties of guiness , if i remember correctly .
since then , i have watched him progress from intern to resident , to research scientist and finally the best of all i think you'd agree .
paten holder
ladies and gentlmen ,
dr. william jennings .
why won't you let me empty our accounts and give you the money now?
i don't think you have a backseat closet .
another thing , it will look a little suspicious , don't you think?
you see , unlike me , most kidnappers are morons .
they all get busted the minute they try to go for the ransom money .
they try all kinds of comlicated shit but you know , the fact the matter is , no ransom pickup is safe from the fbl .
you see the statistics from this country .
damn , zero kidnappings for ransom was successful . and you know why?
it's because of the ransom pickup .
that's why i can't go to pick up any ransom .
is that beautiful or what?
why can't abby be here right now?
because this is a machine .
okay?
this is a machine that runs on fear .
your fear for abby .
tell me the truth .
that's the only thing that kept you from pulling the trigger .
and you're ready to go .
am i right?
am i right?
until now , position has been unable to use paralyzing alexins of that fear of fatal outcomes , all costly losses .
that day is over .
i am now adjusting the patients for the rest arrays .
developed by myself and bryan adams's pharmaceutical company , and tested in my own clinical trials at storium memorial hospital in portland ,
within seconds , this 3rd generation varied into atropine counteracts the effect of the succinic aconite restoring full nerve combatively and muscle function .
don't you have any feeling for the children you're hurting?
if you can't stand anything for 24 hours ,
i won't be still alive for years .
what are you talking about 24 hours?
all shows take exactly 24 hours .
day's work for day's pay .
2 and 50 k.
oh my god , listen to me .
if you wait till tomorrow
abby could die .
no , no , no .
you listen to me okay?
we're on a timetable here .
let's get something straight .
there are no dvas , since no exceptions and no surprises .
she is asthmatic .
she's severly asthmatic .
she could have attack anytime .
let's try .
open the drawer you're sitting on .
open it !!
abigal
shit !
anything could bring an attack on .
allegy , smoke , stress
please tell me your cousin doesn't smoke .
does he smoke?
shit !
shut up !
hey , where are you?
hey , we're almost there .
you're early .
what's the matter?
hey listen , listen .
take a look at the kid .
give me the phone !
we got a situation here , marvin .
you want me to take care of her?
no !!
not yet .
well , it's been over 30 seconds .
we'd better hang up .
this is what i want you to do .
i want you to take a look at the kid and put your hand on her chest .
is she breathing?
hold on .
it's a kind of like ... shallow .
all right .
this is what i want you to do .
i want you to get her inside .
and i want you to close the window ,
let her wander around , okay?
she has a trouble breathing .
give her strong coffee decaf and open her airways .
joe , you want me to do that?
yes
just call me if there's a problem , okay?
you would be grateful if i helped your little girl , right?
yes .
what?
yes .
how would you show me?
you take me to her first .
and then i'll show you .
how does every woman know that?
how to be a hooker .
get the payment upfront !
is that what you're teaching at the awkward workshop?
nobody is to teach how to protect your child .
you'd know that if you're behind one .
hey marvin , it's me .
we're almost there .
she is still sleeping .
yeah , okay , i'll call you .
they are not there yet .
i'd like to see the bedroom .
come on .
hey , dr. jennings .
hi
can i help you?
listen , my keycard doesn't work .
i was wondering if i could use your phone to call the frontdesk .
you know that there's a phone right by the elevator .
you're right .
that must be such a rush , huh?
just standing up there , having everybody want to be you .
a young guy with big idea and a big future
i got hot just as watching you .
i am flattered .
i am ... well , i'm so ... married .
then we can do things to talk out .
because it's something i'll do it ... not you .
oh , i'm sorry , darling , but ...
i don't think it's going to happen .
you will find some other things . you'll find 50 .
just not me .
good night .
50 is not good to me , doc .
'cause abby doesn't have 50 , daddy's .
what did you say?
your daughter has been kidnapped for 3 hours .
and she's not going to live thru the night if you don't let me in your room right now .
i'm calling to police .
don't fucking use that phone .
if you call the cops or house , whatever you may have , it's going to be the bullet into abby's brain .
all right .
i have to make a phonecall in the next 5 minutes .
if anything stops me making that phonecall , your kid is dead .
what do i have to do get my little girl back?
you know whole new world , dr. jennings .
right now my partner has your wife at your house .
the little girl is being held in 3rd location .
where?
when you calm down
i'm going to make a phonecall .
after that , this phone is going to ring every 30 minutes and if i don't say things are cool
you may as well pick out of 3 book cascade .
where is my little girl?
i don't know .
i don't know where your little girl is .
i only know she's being held in some place the police can't possibly get to in there 30 minutes between our phonecalls .
that's not going to happen .
sit down .
you skip the part of at us getting , then i'll be back .
tomorrow morning , your wife is going to wire $250, 000 to a local bank .
you're going to go pick up that money .
after you give it to me , your wifeand your child will be let go with inside of each other .
how would she going to explain them?
oh , please .
she's going to call your broker .
she's going to say that you stumbled onto another painting .
that you simply had to add your crappy little art collection .
you got this whole thing covered , doctor .
it's really fucking easy .
you follow the rules and get abby back .
it's that simple .
you think i'd believe that after i've seen your face?
this is the 5th time we've done this .
all the other parents saw our faces .
not one them reported the police .
you know why?
'cause if you go to the police , to look at them , we'll know .
my partner will come back and he'll kill your child .
marvin , is everything all right?
marvin !
fine , she's sleeping .
i will call you .
mommy?
your mom is not here right now , abby .
i am marvin .
she asked me to keep you for a while .
where is she?

where is she?
she had to go to a party .
i want my mom .
no , it's okay .
it's okay .
we're going to be fine here tonight .
it's going to go by really fast .
no , it's going to go by really fast .
mom

what took you so long?
problems .
he's difficult .

i've got to tell you that the view is unbelievable .
inside , and you know
i'm looking at a picture of abby right now .
i don't want to see you , man .
i don't see you at all .
she is a spitting image of your wife , you know .
it's kind of ... makes you wonder , doesn't it?
listen , joe .
it's clear that we got a difficult situation .
let me know what you need and i'll make it happen quickly and quietly .
anything you say , okay?
oh , okay , okay , so this is your bedside , man , right?
you talk to people like the fucking idiots and then you just go on whatever fuck you want well , let me tell you something
i am not your fucking patient , all right?
i don't want to upset you , joe .
but i need you to listen .
my daughter has asthma .
don't need it , " my daughter " .
3 and half minutes without air ,
abby's brain starts to die .
that's what you're dealing with .
look , abby needs to be with karen . if not that , she needs medicine .
that is going to put control back in your hands .
back in my hands? and put my partner back on .
hey , i'm the doctor tonight .
i'm the one who decides whether or not your girl lives or dies .
please don't make me prove ,
and put my partner back on .
hey , how come we didn't know about this asthma thing?
how could you miss that , joey?
i don't like it .
i give a shit what you'd like .
just keep an eye on him , all right?
all right .
who is that guy?
that's my husband .
i wonder if he knows what is good .

i'd like to hear the sound of your voice .
what do you want to talk about?
why don't you tell me how you met dr. will?
you don't want to talk about that .
sort of subject .
let's see if i can guess .
you were a nurse . and you put him through med school , and you quit and had the baby , right?
how did you know that?
i'm just an excellent judge of character .
we're here?
marvin will be here soon .
you are not going to be emotional . and you will not freak out .
give the kid the medicine , and then we're going to go .
i understand .
you'd better make sure to do because i'm going to have a gun on you every seconds .
abby's going to go , a little crazy when you leave .
it's going to be tough for her to act just like the first day you go to school .
remember that , all right?
if you freak out and if you try to run ,
i will shoot you .
and i will shoot her .
i will shoot you with her daddy's gone .
and she'll left embarrassed for the rest of her life .

why don't you stop pressing your smart buttons?
i just let this happen way it has just like every other times .
this is not like every other time .
'cause abby is sick and you're mixed up joe's fucked up .

she was a little girl just like you
she is in heaven now .
abby's kitten in heaven .
are you her daddy?
she was my family and my friend .
she died 2 years ago .

let's get down to business .
make me feel like i'm 21 again .
let me guess .
you guys do it and then you end up where you're at .
am i right?
how does it look on me?
how do you pick the families you go after?
they got to be rich .
they got to have kids of right age .
and moms have to be pretty .
and they have to be doctors , right?
so where did you get your names from?

i know that you would be a judge there .
you are not like the other moms .
close your eyes
i like to watch .

what's that?
it's a scalp puncher .
it will take your grip in and out so easy , you'd barely even feel it .
jesus christ ...

where is abby , sheryl?
you do know .
you've done this 4 times before .
i don't fucking know .
it means that i know it's a part of the plan .
this is succinic aconite , sheryl .
if i inject this to your body , you will be paralyzed .
you will be able to see , hear , and think , but you won't able to move , and you won't be able to breathe .
what the fuck are you doing , man?
sheryl , i have seen murderers turning to a whimpering babies by this stuff .
you have a choice
you can tell me where you're holding abby
or you can find out what it feels like to die .
if i pull this trigger , you will be dead .
pull it .
no
don't fight it , sheryl
i know you can hear me .
you're struggling , aren't you?
telling your arms to move , but they won't .
you want to breathe , but you can't .
unless i give you the antidope .
it's like living death , isn't it , sheryl?
maybe your feeling's almost as my little girl's right now .
we are going to do this over and over until you tell me where abby is .
or until i can bring her back .
now , you remember what i told you .
3 and a half minutes without air , your brain is dying .
now you're almost there .
remember what this feels like .

she's where my baby found .

what're you talking about?
give my wallet .

oh , god .
katie yakky
you think that i killed katie?
yeah , katie yakky
i know you did .
this is what he told me .
told you what?
you know you saturated her , right?
you looked after her breathing .
you didn't monitor her pressure .
i remember every details of katie's case .
she had grumes in tumor , the sergeon had difficulty trying to remove , but he couldn't control her major argon he couldn't control her bleeding .
he said she was barbiturated and covered
he said his operation was well .
then he lied to you , sheryl .
he told you katie was recovering to protect himself
'cause you wouldn't think it is his fault .
jesus
this is why you chill us all .
'cause you want a revenge .
oh , no , you can't get that hard .
sheryl , you have to tell where my daughter is .
there's an cabin at the eastern hold in caskey .
okay , it's time to make the call .
you think you're smarter than all the other moms?
no , you are not .
'cause they didn't hurt me .
and now you get your daughter alive?
i want you to think about marvin now .
sitting there , watching the clock .
waiting
it's time .
it's time to play the game .
first , you have to close your eyes .
joe , she is my daughter .
she is my little girl .
okay now , what you have to do ... is you have to think nice thoughts .
pretty thoughts .
i'm thinking about my mommy .
yeah , that's it .
she's pretty .
she's pretty and she loves you very much .
now i want you to stay very still .
joey?
yes .
it's me .
who the fuck else it will be?
you're late , joey .
you can't be late .

just like the other times .
right?
yes .
just like the other times .
i'm going to follow your plan .
you don't have to worry about me .
and you will get your money .
did you ever think that ... maybe it wasn't about the money
i mean ... that ever crossed your mind?
that a guy like me could be motivated by something other than grip .
hank , wake up , it's emergency .
what happened?
my child is in danger but you can help her .
before i tell you anything ,
you got to promise me not to call the police .
i don't understand .
my daughter's kidnapped last night
i can't go to the police , 'cause if i do ,
the kidnappers will kill her .
understand?
yes .
and that you sync the phone , you wires on network , i am hoping ,
i am praying the vice president of wire source can trace us the calls for me .
can i go home now?
pretty soon .
go home and see your mommy .
we have to wait for a phonecall .
and then we can go .
those are the rules .
it's fine that they always do it the same with clouds and sun for hours .
she doesn't have good hands , you know .
they have travelled with that , but she is good .
it's a bad day , isn't it?
i know .
i know you have kids , joe .
don't think that you know me .
