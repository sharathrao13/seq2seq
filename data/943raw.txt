pack of cigarettes .

are you sure?
about what?
do you really wanna buy those cigarettes?
are you serious?
how long you been smoking?
what is this , a poll?
how long you been a smoker?
i don't know .
since i was about 13 .
thirteen .
let's see , you're about 19 , 20?
am i right?
what in the hell is that?
that's your lung .
by this time , your lung looks like this .
you've gotta be shitting me .
you think i'm shitting you?
here .
what's this?
a trach ring .
it's what they install in your throat when cancer takes your voice box .
this one came out of a 60 year old man .
oh , god !
he smoked until the day he died .
used to put the cigarette in this and smoke that way .
excuse me , but
this is where you're heading .
cruddy lung , smoking through a hole in your throat .
do you really want that?
lf it's already too late , i guess
no , it's never too late .
put the cigarettes back , and try some gum instead .
here .
chewlies gum .
try this . it's not the same .
it's cheaper than cigarettes , and it certainly beats this .
oh , jesus ! it's a picture of a cancer ridden lung .
keep it .
i'll just take the gum .
fifty five .
you made a very wise choice .
keep up the good work .
if you're gonna drink that coffee , i think you oughta take it outside , huh?
i think i'll drink it in here .
thanks .
if you're gonna drink it in here , i'd appreciate it if you don't bother the customers .
okay .
i'm sorry about that .
pack of cigarettes .
what's that?
this?
how long you been smoking?
<muslc> kill the drummer <muslc>
<muslc> kill the bass player kill both bass players <muslc>
<muslc> this song is the reason why i'm now going deaf <muslc><muslc>
let's kick some ass !
yeah !
i feel good today , silent bob .
we're gonna make some money .
and you know what we're gonna do?
we're gonna go to that party and get some pussy .
i'm gonna fuck this bitch , i'm gonna fuck this bitch .
i'll fuck anything that moves !
what the fuck you lookin 'at?
i'll kick your fuckin 'ass !
shit , yeah .
don't that motherfucker owe me ten bucks?
you know , tonight we're going to rip off this fucker's head , take out his fuckin 'soul .
remind me if he wants to buy something .
i'm gonna shit in the motherfucker's bag .
what's up , baby?
what's up , sluts?
yeah .
so , bob , you're a rude motherfucker , you know that?
you're cute as hell .
i could go down on you , suck you ,
line up three other guys , make like a circus seal .
hey , what're you , a fucking faggot?
i hate guys .
i love women !
what you want , grizzly adams?
you're spending what , 20 , maybe 30 dollars a week on your cigarettes?
yeah .
forty .
fifty three .
fifty three dollars a week on cigarettes !
come on !
would you give somebody that much money each week to kill you?
that's what you're doing now by paying for this so called privilege to smoke !
we're gonna croak sometime .
it's that mentality that allows the cancer producing industry to thrive .
of course we're all gonna die someday !
do we have to pay for it?
do we have to actually throw hard earned dollars down on the counter ... and say , " please , mr. merchant of death , sir , please ,
sell me something that will stink up my breath and clothes ,
and fry my lungs !
now , wait a second .
here comes the speech about how he's just doing his job by following orders .
let me tell you about another group of hate mongers that were just following orders .
who's that?
they were called nazis !
yeah , that's right .
friggin 'nazi .
they practically wiped an entire nation off the earth ,
like your cigarettes are doing now !
i think you'd oughta leave .
you want me to leave .
why?
'cause somebody's telling it like it is , giving these fine people a wake up call?
yeah .
no , you're loitering and causing a disturbance .
i'm a disturbance?
you're the disturbance , pal .
here , now i am a customer .
i'm gonna buy some chewlies gum .
i'm a customer engaged in a discussion with the other customers .
that's right .
smoke my big fat cock !
he's scared now 'cause he sees the threat we present .
he smells the change is coming !
you definitely are the source in this area , and we're gonna shut you down for good !
for good , cancer merchant !
cancer merchant !
cancer merchant !
who's leading this mob?
that guy .
freeze !
let's see some credentials .
slowly !
you're a chewlies gum representative?
chewlies?
you're stirring up anti smoking sentiment to , what , sell more gum?
get out of here !
and you people don't you have jobs to go to?
get out of here .
go commute .
you oughta be ashamed of yourselves .
a bunch of easily led automatons .
try thinking for yourselves before you pelt an innocent man with cigarettes !
uh , pack of cigarettes?
don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?
i have enough indignities in my life and people start throwing cigarettes at me .
at least they weren't lit .
oh , i hate this fucking place .
then quit .
you should be going to school anyway .
please , veronica , at this point , the last thing i need is a lecture .
all i'm saying is , if you're that unhappy , you should leave .
i'm not even supposed to be here today !
i know .
i stopped by your house .
your mom told me you left , like , at 6 : 00 or something .
the guy got sick .
he couldn't come in .
don't you have a hockey game at 2 : 00?
yes .
and i'm gonna play like shit because i didn't have a good night's sleep .
why'd you agree to come in then?
hey , i'm only here until 12 : 00 .
after that , i'm gone .
the boss comes in .
why don't you open the shutters?
get some sunlight in here .
someone jammed gum in the locks .
you're kidding .
bunch of savages in this town .
thanks .
how much money did you leave up there?
like , three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles .
this time in the morning , people just get a paper or coffee .
you're trusting .
why do you say that?
how do you know they're taking the right amount of change or even paying for what they take?
theoretically , people see money on the counter , no one around , they think they're being watched .
honesty through paranoia .
why do you smell like shoe polish?
i needed shoe polish to make that sign out there .
smell won't come off .
you think anybody can see us down here?
why , you wanna have sex or something?
can we?
really?
i was kidding .
like you can't get enough of me .
typically male point of view .
how do you figure?
show some bedroom proficiency , you think you're gods .
what about what we do for you?
women as lovers are basically the same ; they just have to be there .
be there?
making a male climax isn't at all challenging .
insert somewhere close , preferably moist , thrust , repeat .
how flattering .
now , making a woman come , therein lies a challenge .
you think so?
a woman makes a guy come , it's standard .
a guy makes a woman come , it's talent .
and i actually date you?
something wrong?
i'm insulted .
believe me , don juan , it takes more than that to get a guy off .
just being there , as you put it , is not enough .
hmm , i've touched a nerve .
i'm astonished to hear you you trivialize my role in our sex life .
it wasn't directed at you .
i was making a broad generalization .
you're making a generalization about broads .
those are my opinions based on the few women ... who were goodly enough to sleep with me .
how many?
how many what?
how many different girls have you slept with?
didn't we have this discussion once before?
we might have .
i don't remember .
how many? including you?
it better be up to and including me .
twelve .
you slept with 12 different girls?
including you?
yes .
ow !
what'd you do that for?
you're a pig !
why'd you hit me?
do you know how many different men i've had sex with?
do i get to hit you after you tell me?
three .
three?
three , including you .
you only slept with three different people?
i'm not the pig you are .
who?
you !
no , who are the three , besides me .
john francin and rob stanslik .
wow .
that's why you should feel like a pig .
you men make me feel sick .
you'll sleep with anything that says yes .
animal , mineral or vegetable .
vegetable , meaning paraplegic .
they put up the least amount of struggle .
after dropping a bombshell like that , you owe me big .
name it .
i want you to come with me on monday .
where?
to school .
there's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program ... after a lapse in enrollment .
can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up?
it's important to me , dante .
you have so much potential that's going to waste in this pit .
i wish you'd go back to school .
stop .
you're making my head hurt .
shit !
why're you getting up?
unlike you , i have class in 45 minutes .
willam?
hey , ronni .
how you been , man?
what , do you work here now?
no , i was visiting my man .
dante , this is willam black .
this is dante hicks , my boyfriend .
how you doing?
just the soda?
no , and a pack of cigarettes .
so where you been , man?
still going to seton hall?
no , i transferred into monmouth this year .
i was tired of missing him .
that's beautiful , man .
so , you still talk to silvan?
i just talked to her on monday .
we still hang out on weekends .
oh , that's great .
well , you two lovebirds take it easy , okay?
bye .
take it easy .
that was snowball .
why do you call him that?
silvan made it up .
it's a blow job thing .
what do you mean?
after the blow job , he likes to have it spit back into his mouth while kissing .
it's called snowballing .
he requests this?
he gets off on it .
silvan can be talked into anything .
why do you say that?
like you said , she snowballed him .
silvan?
no , i snowballed him .
yeah , right .
i'm serious .
you sucked that guy's dick?
yeah .
how do you think i knew
you said you only had sex with three different guys !
you never mentioned him !
because i never had sex with him .
you sucked his dick !
we went out a few times .
we never had sex , but we fooled around .
oh , my god .
why did you tell me you only had sex with three guys?
because i did only have sex with three guys . it doesn't mean i didn't just go with people .
oh , my god , i feel so nauseous !
i'm sorry , dante .
i thought you understood .
i did understand !
i understood that you had sex with three guys and that's all you said !
please calm down .
how many?
dante , let it go !
how many dicks have you sucked?
shut up a second and i'll tell you .
jesus !
i didn't freak out like this when you told me how many girls you fucked !
this is different .
this is important .
how many?
well?
something like 36 .
what?
something like 36?
lower your voice .
what is that " something like 36 "?
does that include me?
uh ... 37 .
i'm 37?
i'm going to class .
oh , my god .
37 !
my girlfriend sucked 37 dicks ! in a row?
where you going?
hey , listen , jerk .
until today , you never even knew ... how many guys i slept with because you never even bothered to ask .
then you act all nonchalant about fucking 12 girls .
i never had sex with 12 guys !
no , but you sucked enough dick !
yeah , i went down on a few guys .
a few?
one of those guys was you .
the last one , i might add .
which , if you're too stupid to comprehend , means that i've been faithful to you since we met .
all the other guys i went with before i met you .
if you want to have a complex , go ahead .
but don't look at me like i'm the town whore , because you were plenty busy before you met me .
why did you suck their dick?
why couldn't you sleep with them like any other decent person?
because going down isn't a big deal .
i used to like a guy , we'd make out , and sooner or later i'd go down on him .
but i only had sex with the guys i loved .
i feel sick .
i love you !
don't feel sick .
every time i kiss you , i'm gonna taste 36 other guys .
i'm going to school .
maybe later you'll be a bit more rational .
i'm 37 !
i just can't
good bye , dante !
hey , try not to suck any dick on the way through the parking lot !
hey !
hey , you !
get back here .
i thought that place was supposed to be open at 11 : 00 . it's 11 : 20 .
i've already called his house twice .
he'll be here soon .
hey , it's not like it's a demanding job over there .
i'd like to get paid to sit on my ass and watch tv .
i walked in the other day , that son of a bitch was sleeping .
i'm sure he wasn't sleeping .
are you calling me a liar?
are you calling me a liar?
no !
he was probably just resting his eyes .
what the hell is that , " resting his eyes "?
like he's some air traffic controller?
actually , that's his night job .
wise ass too , huh?
go ahead .
keep cracking wise .
that's why you're jockeying a register in some fuckin 'convenience store ... instead of working at a steady job .
i've got no time to bullshit around , waiting for that son of a bitch .
make sure he gets that .
the number's 812 .
my name's wynarski .
i wanted a movie tonight .
if you tell me the title of the movie , he'll hold it for you .
don't hurt yourself , buddy .
i'll go to big choice video instead .
you forgot your keys .
guy ain't here yet .
you're kidding ! it's almost 11 : 30 .
i've been here since 11 : 00 .
i hate it when i can't rent videos !
i would've went to big choice , but the tape i want is right there on that wall .
which one?
dental school .
you came for that too?
that's the movie i came for .
i have first dibs .
says who?
says me .
i've been here half an hour .
i'd call that first dibs .
ain't gonna happen , my friend .
i'm getting that movie .
like hell you are .
i'll bet you 20 bucks you don't get to rent that tape .
twenty bucks?
twenty bucks .
all right , asshole .
you're on .
you're late .
what the hell are you doing here?
the boss called .
arthur fell ill .
why are the shutters closed?
someone jammed gum in the locks .
bunch of savages in this town .
that's what i said .
if i'd known you were here , i'd have come even later .
what smells like shoe polish?
go open the store .
hey , you see a set of keys around here?
no time for love , dr. jones .
fucking kids .
some guy just came in refusing to pay late fees .
said the store was closed for two hours yesterday .
i tore up his membership .
shocking abuse of authority .
i'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class , especially since i rule .
want something to drink?
i'm buying .
no , thanks .
who was on your phone this morning , like , 2 : 30?
i was trying to call for half an hour .
why?
i wanted to use your car .
snack cake .
you don't wanna know .
you call caitlin again?
she called me .
you tell veronica?
one fight a day with veronica is all i can stomach , thanks .
what do you fight about?
we don't fight about anything .
she wants me to leave here and go back to school and get some direction .
i bet the most frequent topic of arguments is caitlin bree .
you win .
i'm going to offer you some advice , my friend .
let the past be the past .
forget caitlin bree .
you been with veronica how long now?
seven months .
chick's nuts about you .
how long you date caitlin?
five years .
chick only made you nuts , man .
she cheated on you how many times?
eight and a half .
eight and a half?
party at john kay's , senior year ; i get blitzed , pass out in his bedroom .
caitlin comes in and jumps all over me .
so that's cheating?
no .
in the middle of it she called me brad .
she called you brad?
that's not cheating .
people say crazy shit during sex .
one time , i called this girl " mom .
i hit the light , she freaks .
she thought i was brad michelson .
what do you mean?
she was supposed to meet brad in a dark bedroom .
she picked the wrong one .
she didn't even know i was at the party .
oh , my god .
great story , huh?
that girl was vile to you .
interesting postscript to that story .
do you know who wound up in that bedroom with brad?
your mother?
alan harris .
chess team alan harris?
the two moved to idaho together .
they raise sheep .
that's frightening .
takes different strokes to move the world .
in light of this lurid tale , i don't see ... how you could romanticize your relationship with caitlin .
she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles .
there was a lot of good in our relationship .
aside from the cheating , we were a great couple .
that's what high school was about : algebra , bad lunch and infidelity .
you think things will be different this time?
they are .
when she calls me now , she's a different person .
she's frightened , vulnerable .
she's finishing college and about to enter the real world .
that's scary for anyone .
shit , i gotta place an order .
talkin 'to myself here .
i'm listening .
she's leaving college and  and she's looking for support .
i think this is leading our relationship to a new level .
what about veronica?
i think the arguments veronica and i are having are some kind of manifestation ... of a subconscious desire to break up with her , so i can pursue a more meaningful relationship with caitlin .
caitlin's on the same wavelength? it's safe to say yes .
i think all four of you better sit down and talk it over .
all four?
you , veronica , caitlin and caitlin's fianc .
do you sell video tapes?
yeah .
what are you looking for?
happy scrappy hero pup .
uh , one second .
i'm on the phone with the distribution house .
let me make sure they got it .
what's it called again?
happy scrappy hero pup .
happy scrappy  she loves it .
obviously .
this is rst video calling .
customer number 4352 .
i'd like to place an order .
whispers in the wind , to each his own ,
put it where it doesn't belong , my pipes need cleaning ,
all tit fucking , volume eight , i need your cock ,
ass worshipping rim jobbers , my cunt and eight shafts ,
cum clean , cum gargling naked sluts , cum buns ill ,
cumming in socks , cum on ilene ,
huge black cocks with pearly white cum ,
girls who crave cock , girls who crave cunt ,
the ky connection , pink pussy lips , oh , yeah , and , uh , all holes filled with hard cock .
yup .
oh , wait a minute .
what was that called again?
<muslc> i'm a needle , you know <muslc>
<muslc> never want to be a haystack <muslc>
<muslc> don't ever want to break your heart in two <muslc>
<muslc> know the crowd is gonna sell their soul <muslc>
<muslc> take it anywhere i know well , i promise you <muslc> <muslc> it's making me sick <muslc><muslc>
yes , i'd like to check on a misprint in today's edition .
today's edition .
it says , " bree to wed asian design major .
no , everything's spelled fine .
i was just wondering if the article was a misprint .
i don't know , like a typographical error or something .
maybe it should say , " caitlin bray " or " caitlin bre " with one " e.
i'm a curious party .
a curious party .
i'm an ex boyfriend , and , well ,
i talk to her all the time and she never mentioned this engagement .
that's why i'm thinking maybe it's a misprint .
are you sure?
maybe there's a vindictive printer working for you .
meaning like , someone who asked her out once and got shot down , and this is his revenge by putting this bogus article in the paper when it went to press .
hello .
hello?
i don't care if she's my cousin , i'm gonna knock those boots again tonight .
look who it is .
the fuckin 'human vacuum .
scumbag , what are you doing?
just hanging with silent bob and his cousin .
he's your cousin?
he's from russia too .
no way .
what part of russia?
i don't know .
do i look like his fuckin 'biographer?
olaf , what part of russia are you from?
moscow .
he only speaks russian?
he speaks some english , but he cannot speak it good like we do .
is he staying here?
nah , he's moving to the big city this week .
he wants to be a metal singer .
no way .
i swear .
olaf , metal .
that's his fucking metal face .
olaf , girl nice?
that's fucked up , man .
what did he say?
i don't know , man , but this guy's a character .
he really wants to play metal?
yeah , he's got his own band in moscow . it's called " fuck your yankee blue jeans " or something .
that doesn't sound metal .
you gotta hear him sing .
olaf , " berserker .
come on , man , " berserker " !
does he sing in english or russian?
in english .
come on , " berserker .
girls think sexy .
aah .
aah .
watch , he's gonna sing it .
it's too funny .
<muslc> my love for you is like a truck , berserker <muslc>
<muslc> would you like some making fuck , berserker <muslc>
that's fuckin 'funny , man .
did he say , " making fuck "?
<muslc> my love for you is ticking clock , berserker <muslc>
<muslc> would you like to suck my cock , berserker <muslc><muslc>
that's beautiful , man .
hold on to the counter and i'll pull .
usually i just turn the can upside down .
maybe we oughta soap your hand up .
they oughta put a warning on these things , like they do with cigarettes .
i think it's coming !
thanks .
i thought i was going to have to go to the hospital .
i'll throw this out as a precautionary measure .
stings a little .
sometimes you got to let those hard to reach chips go .
thanks .
you know , that article's accurate .
caitlin really is getting married .
you know what i just watched?
me pulling a can off some moron's fist?
return of the jedi .
didn't you hear me?
caitlin is really getting married .
jedi or the empire strikes back?
empire .
blasphemy .
empire had the better ending .
i mean , luke gets his hand cut off , finds out vader's his father .
han gets frozen , taken away by boba fett . it ends on such a down note .
i mean , that's what life is : a series of down endings .
all jedi had was a bunch of muppets .
there was something else going on in jedi .
i never noticed it 'til today .
they build another death star , right?
yeah .
the first one was completed and fully operational before the rebels destroyed it .
luke blew it up .
give credit where credit's due .
the second one was still being built when they blew it up .
compliments of lando calrissian .
something just never sat right with me that second time around .
i could never put my finger on it , but something just wasn't right .
and you figured it out .
the first death star was manned by the lmperial army .
the only people on board were storm troopers , dignitaries , lmperialists .
basically .
so when they blew it up , no problem .
evil's punished .
and the second time around? it wasn't even done being built yet . it was still under construction .
so?
a construction job of that magnitude would require ... a lot more manpower than the lmperial army had to offer .
i'll bet they brought independent contractors in on that thing .
plumbers , aluminum siders , roofers  not just lmperialists .
is that what you're getting at?
exactly .
to get it built quickly and quietly , they'd hire anybody that could do the job .
you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?
all they know is killing .
so they bring in independent contractors .
why are you so upset?
those innocent contractors brought in are killed , casualties of a war they had nothing to do with .
look , you're a roofer .
some juicy government contract comes your way .
you got a wife and kids , the two story in suburbia .
this is a government contract which means all sorts of benefits .
along come these left wing militants who blast everything ... within a three mile radius with their lasers .
you didn't ask for that ; you had no personal politics .
you're just trying to scrape out a living .
i don't mean to interrupt ,
but what are you talking about?
the ending of return of the jedi .
my friend is trying to convince me that independent contractors working on the death star ... were innocent victims when it was destroyed by the rebels .
i'm a contractor myself .
i'm a roofer .
done and ready home improvements .
speaking as a roofer , i can tell you a roofer's personal politics ...
comes into play heavily when choosing jobs .
like when?
three weeks ago , i was offered a job up in the hills .
beautiful house .
tons of property .
a simple re shingling job .
they told me if i could finish it in one day , i would double my price .
then i realized whose house it was .
whose house was it?
dominic bambino's .
baby face bambino?
the gangster?
the same !
the money was right , but the risk was too high .
i knew who he was , and based on that , i turned the job over to a friend .
based on personal politics .
right !
the next week , the foresie family put a hit on baby face's house .
my friend was shot and killed .
didn't even finish re shingling .
no way .
i'm alive because i knew the risk involved in that particular client .
my friend wasn't so lucky .
any contractor working on that death star knew the risk involved .
if they got killed , it's their own fault .
a roofer listens to this , not his wallet .
they say so much , but they never tell you if it's any good .
are either one of these any good?
sir?
what?
are either one of these any good?
i don't watch movies .
well , have you heard anything about either one of them?
i find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs .
you mean you haven't heard anybody say anything about either one of these?
nope .
well , what about these two?
they suck .
these are the same two movies .
you weren't paying any attention .
no , i wasn't .
i don't think your manager would appreciate it
i don't appreciate your ruse , ma'am .
i beg your pardon?
your ruse .
your cunning attempt to trick me .
i was only pointing out that you weren't paying any attention to what i was saying .
and i hope it feels good .
you hope what feels good?
i hope it feels so good to be right .
there's nothing more exhilarating ... than pointing out the shortcomings of others , is there?
well , this is the last time i rent here !
you will be missed .
screw you !
hey , you're not allowed to rent here anymore !
yeah !
screw me?
you'll never believe what this unruly customer just said .
wait .
she in here?
this guy's going through all the eggs .
this has been going on for 20 minutes now .
what's he looking for?
said he has to find the perfect dozen .
perfect dozen?
each egg has to be perfect .
the quest isn't going well?
obviously not .
look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade .
why doesn't he mix and match?
i told him that , and he yelled at me .
what'd he say?
he said it was important to have standards .
he says no one has any pride anymore .
it's not like you laid the eggs yourself .
i give him five more minutes .
after that , i'm calling the cops .
i don't need this .
i'm not even supposed to be here today .
two packs of cigarettes .
i'm as puzzled as you .
i've actually seen it before .
you know him?
no , but i know the behavior .
let me guess .
he's looking for the perfect carton of eggs?
how'd you know?
i'll bet you a million dollars he's a guidance counselor .
why do you say that?
i saw it happen in food city , like , last year .
different guy , though .
stock boy said he'd been looking through cartons of eggs for half an hour , doing all sorts of endurance tests and stuff .
i asked him why nobody ever called the manager , and he said it happens ... two , three times a week , sometimes more .
get out of here .
no , i kid you not .
they call it shell shock .
seems to only happen with guidance counselors .
they used to make a big deal of it , but they just let it go now ... because they always pay for whatever they break , and they never bother anybody .
why guidance counselors?
if your job was as meaningless as theirs , wouldn't you go crazy too?
come to think of it , my guidance counselor was kinda worthless .
see?
it's important to have a job that makes a difference , boys .
that's why i manually masturbate caged animals for artificial insemination .
<muslc> go your own way <muslc>
<muslc> you can call it another lonely day <muslc><muslc>
did you ever notice that all the prices end in " 9 "?
damn , that's eerie .
do you know how much the average jiz mopper makes per hour?
what's a jiz mopper?
the guy that cleans up the nudie booths after each guy jerks off .
" nudie booth "?
yeah , nudie booth .
you ever been in a nudie booth?
guess not .
oh , man , it's great .
you go into this booth , and there's this glass between you and these chicks .
and they put on a show for you for , like , ten bucks .
what kind of a show?
think of the weirdest , craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do .
these chicks do it all .
they insert things into any opening on their body .
any opening .
can we not talk about this now?
the jiz mopper's job is to clean it up after each guy shoots a load .
practically everybody does it right on the window .
i don't know if you know this , but cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it right away .
i will never come to this place again .
excuse me?
using filthy language in front of the customers .
you both should be fired .
oh , l i'm sorry .
i guess we kinda got carried away .
i don't know if sorry can make up for it .
you've highly offended me .
well , if you think that's offensive , check this out .
oh !
i think you can see her kidneys .
why do you do things like that?
you know he's only going to come back and tell the boss .
who cares?
that guy's an asshole .
everybody that comes in here is way too uptight .
this job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers .
jesus !
i'm gonna hear from the boss tomorrow .
would you loosen up?
you'd feel a lot better if you'd just rip into the occasional customer .
why? l i don't bother them and they don't bother me .
liar !
tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis .
there aren't !
how can you lie like that?
why don't you vent?
vent your frustrations .
who pisses you off?
well , i guess it isn't customers in particular .
maybe just a group of customers .
well , let's hear it .
well , the milk maids .
the milk maids?
the women that go through every gallon of milk , looking for that later date , as if somewhere beyond all the other gallons is a container of milk ... that won't go bad for like a decade .
you know who i can do without?
the people in the video store .
which ones?
all of 'em .
what would you get for a six year old boy who chronically wets his bed?
so , do you have any new movies in?
do you have that one with that guy who was in that movie that was out last year?
they never rent quality flicks .
they always pick the most intellectually devoid movie on the racks .
oooh !
navy seals !
it's like in order to join they have to have an i. q. less than their shoe size .
you think you get stupid questions?
you should hear the barrage that i get .
what do you mean there's no ice?
i've got to drink this coffee hot?
so , how much is this thing anyway?
do you sell hubcaps for a '72 pinto hatchback?
ooh !
mini trucker magazine .
see?
you vented .
don't you feel better?
no .
why not?
because my ex girlfriend is getting married .
jesus , you got a one track mind .
it's always caitlin , caitlin , caitlin .
veronica !
what happened to home by 12 : 00?
boss hasn't shown up yet .
how come you're not in class?
lit .
101 got cancelled .
so i stopped home and i brought you some lunch .
what is it?
peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off .
what do you think it is? it's lasagna .
really?
oh , you're the queen .
i'm glad you calmed down a bit .
hi , randal .
thirty seven?
shut up !
yes , i've calmed down .
i'm not happy , but i'll be able to deal .
why don't you go back to the video store?
you had to tell him?
i had to tell someone .
he put it into perspective .
what did he say?
he said at least he wasn't 36 .
and that made you feel better?
and he said most of them were college guys i never even seen or met before .
if you don't see it  it isn't there .
yes .
thank you for being rational .
thank you for the lasagna .
couldn't get the shutters open?
no .
i called the locksmith .
he said the earliest he could be here is tomorrow morning .
bummer .
well , i gotta head back for the 1 : 30 class .
what time you get finished?
8 : 00 , but i have a sorority meeting 'til 9 : 00 .
so , i'll see you when you close then .
can we go out for coffee?
sure .
good .
see you when you close .
enjoy the lasagna .
vermont?
no , that can't be .
i just talked to him this morning .
he left at what time?
he really went to vermont?
when the hell was someone going to tell me?
he promised me he'd be here by noon !
jesus , when does he get back?
tuesday?
you've gotta be fucking kidding me !
i've got a hockey game at 2 : 00 , and the steel shutters are jammed closed .
and he's in vermont?
i'm not even supposed to be here today !
so i'm stuck here until closing?
oh , this is just great .
i can't fucking believe this .
th
no .
no , i'm sorry .
i didn't mean to yell at you .
yeah , i know .
no , l i'll be all right .
well , that's all i can do , right?
yeah .
all right , thanks .
bye .
vermont?
can you fucking believe this?
he didn't mention that to you this morning?
not a word !
not a fucking word , that slippery shit .
so , what?
you're stuck here all day?
fuck !
why'd you apologize?
what?
i heard you apologize .
why?
you had every reason in the world to be mad .
i know !
jesus !
that seems to be the leitmotif in your life .
ever backing down .
i don't back down !
you always back down .
you assume blame that's not yours .
you come in on your day off ; you buckle like a belt .
you know what really pisses me off?
that i'm right about your buckling?
i'm going to miss the fucking game !
because you buckled .
shut up with that shit .
it ain't helping !
don't yell at me , pal .
i'm sorry .
see?
there you go again .
i can't believe i'm going to miss the fucking game .
at least we're stuck here together .
you got a customer .
what?
what do you want?
i can't fucking believe this .
yeah , hello , sanford .
dante .
i can't play today .
i'm stuck at work .
yeah , i know i'm not scheduled today forget it .
point is , i can't play today .
neither can randal .
he's working too .
wait a second .
do we have to play at the park?
hold on .
you feeling limber?
pull my laces tighter , man .
i've got to tell you , my friend , this is one of the most ballsiest moves i've ever been privy to .
i never thought you capable of such a blatant disregard of store policy .
i told him i had a game today .
it's his own fault .
no arguments here . insubordination rules .
i just want to play hockey like i was scheduled to .
i'm gonna grab a gatorade .
lf you grab a gatorade , then everybody's gonna grab one .
so?
who's gonna pay for these gatorades?
what do you care , you shoe polish smelling motherfucker?
i have a responsibility here .
i can't have everybody grabbing free drinks .
what responsibility?
you're closing the store to play hockey .
he's blunt , but he's got a point .
will you let me maintain some semblance of managerial control?
no , i'm sayin 'if you're gonna be insubordinate , might as well go the full nine , not pussy out when it comes to free shit to drink .
he's right .
as if we're going to have a run on gatorade .
fuckin 'a.
all right !
jesus , you fuckers are pushy !
i hear caitlin's marrying an asian drum major .
design major .
can we not talk about this?
fine by me .
but you're living in denial and suppressing rage , motherfucker .
you going to lock the store?
i don't know .
you're going to lock the video store?
look who you're asking here .
how're we gonna block the street?
we're not playing in the street .

how about covering the point?
man , you suck !
who are you to make assessments?
i'll assess all i want , pal !
dante , you in or out?
don't pass to this guy .
he sucks .
you suck !
like you're any better?
i can whip your ass any day , pal .
easy to say over there .
give me a stick , pretty boy !
i'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass !
you open?
yeah , you open?

all right , there's a stick over there .
you're shooting up against this goal .

what the fuck you talking about?
how many balls you bring?
i brought the orange one and ... the orange one .

you only brought one ball?
i thought redding brought all the balls .
dante had the balls .
nobody has another ball?
shit !
we got what , 12 minutes of a game and it's over?
fuck !
fuck , fuck , fuck !
i'm not even supposed to be here today .
i still get free gatorade , right?
be careful .
i'm trying .
you know , the insides of those has got stuff that can give you cancer .
so i'm told .
yeah .
i had a friend that chewed glass for a living . in the circus .
and he got cancer from chewing fluorescent bulb glass?
nah .
got hit by a bus .
oh .
can i help you?
well , uh , that depends .
you got maybe a toilet in here?
yeah , but it's for employees only .
i understand .
but i , uh , thought maybe you'd let me use it anyway .
i'm not so young anymore and i'm , how do you say , a little incontinent .
sure . in the back , through the cooler .
thank you , sonny boy .
say , uh , what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
the white kind .
i didn't ask about the color .
i mean , is it rough or is it cottony?
actually , it's kinda rough .
oh , boy !
it's gonna knock the hell out of my hemorrhoids .
i thought maybe you could let me have a roll of the soft stuff .
i see you sell the soft stuff back there .
yeah , but  come on , boitshik !
what's the difference?
you said yourself you have the rough stuff in the back .
yeah , sure .
go ahead .
thank you , sonny boy .
you're a lifesaver .
say , young fella , i hate to bother you again , but , uh , maybe i could have something in the back there to read?
a paper or something?
sometimes it takes me a while , and i like to have something to read while it's going on .
yeah , sure , go ahead .
one of the magazines you got in the back behind the counter .
the porno mags?
yeah !
i like the cartoons .
they make me laugh .
they draw some of the biggest titties you ever saw .
not this one .
maybe the one you got underneath this one .
they got bigger titties in there .
here .
now leave me alone .
oh , thank you , sonny boy .
i appreciate it .
hell of a game .
one ball?
i close the store , they come all the way here , for one ball?
hockey is hockey .
at least we got to play .
twelve minutes is not a game .
jesus , it's hardly even a warm up .
bitch , bitch , bitch .
you want something to drink?
yeah , a gatorade .
hey , what happened to all the gatorade?
exactly .
they drank it all .
know what sanford told me?
i can't believe caitlin's getting married .
julie doyer died .
yeah , right .
no , i'm serious .
oh , my god !
sanford's brother dates her cousin .
he found out this morning .
how?
when?
embolism in her brain .
yesterday .
jesus !
she was swimming in the pool in the ymca when it happened .
she died mid backstroke .
i haven't seen her in , like , two years .
correct me if i'm wrong , but wasn't she one of the illustrious 12?
yeah , number six .
you've had sex with a dead person .
i'm gonna go to her wake .
no , you're not . it's today .
what?
posten's funeral parlor .
next show's at 4 : 00 .
shit !
what about tomorrow?
one night only .
she's buried in the morning .
you gotta watch the store .
i gotta go to this .
wait , wait , wait , wait .
has it occurred to you that i might be bereaved as well?
you hardly knew her .
true .
but do you know how many people are gonna be there?
all her old classmates , to say the least .
this is beneath even you .
i'm not gonna miss what's probably gonna be the social event of the season .
you hate people !
but i love gatherings . isn't it ironic?
stop being an asshole .
someone's gotta watch the store .
lf you go , i go .
she meant nothing to you !
she meant nothing to you neither 'til i told you she died .
i'm not taking you to this funeral .
i'm going with you .
i can't close the store .
you just closed the store to play hockey on the roof .
exactly !
which means i can't close it for another hour just so we can both go to a wake .
you were saying?
thanks for putting me in such a tough spot .
you're a good friend .
she was pretty young , huh?
twenty two .
just like us .
embolism in a pool .
what an embarrassing way to die .
that's nothing compared to how my cousin walter died .
how did he die?
he broke his neck .
that's embarrassing?
he broke his neck trying to suck his own dick .
shut the hell up .
i swear .
stop it .
bible truth .
oh , my god !
come on .
haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
no .
yeah , right .
you're so repressed .
because i never tried to suck my own dick?
no , because you won't admit to it .
as if a guy's a fucking pervert 'cause he tries to go down on himself .
you're as curious as the rest of us , pal .
you've tried it .
who found him?
my cousin?
mom found him .
it was a mess .
he was on his bed , his legs doubled over himself .
mom freaked out .
<muslc> you know that you are a shooting star <muslc>
made it , huh?
dick in his mouth?
yeah .
balls resting on his lips .
wow .
he really made it .
yeah , but at what a price .
i can never reach .
reach what?
you know .
what , your dick?
yeah .
like you said , i guess everybody gets curious and tries it sometime .
i never tried it .
fucking pervert .
<muslc> suddenly everyone loved to hear him play his songs <muslc>
<muslc> watch the world go by surprising it goes so fast <muslc>
<muslc> johnny looked around him and said hey , i've made the big time at last <muslc><muslc>
i knew this was a bad idea to close the store .
listen to you .
i can't help it .
at least on the roof , i could see if anybody wanted to go in .
nobody's there .
it's 4 : 00 on a saturday .
how many people ever come to the store at 4 : 00 on a saturday?
let me in !
<muslc> do you know your place <muslc>
<muslc> in the big charade <muslc>
<muslc> are you more than dead <muslc>
<muslc> leaders and followers leaders and followers <muslc><muslc>
i can't fucking believe you .
i'm telling you , it wasn't my fault .
you knocked the casket over , for christ's sake !
i was just leanin 'on it . it was an accident .
like someone knocks a casket over on purpose !
so the casket fell over .
big deal .
her fucking body fell out !
i put her back in it . it's not like it matters if she breaks something .
just go open the video store .
open the video store !
shut the fuck up , junkie .
would you just go open the video store?
yeah , you cock smokin 'clerk .
how many times have i told you not to be dealing in front of the store?
i'm not dealing .
what're you talking about?
have you got anything , man?
what you want?
let me borrow your car .
i don't want to talk to you .
fine .
just let me borrow your car .
why should i loan you my car?
i want to rent a movie .
you want to rent a movie .
what's that for?
you work in a video store !
i work in a shitty video store .
i want to go to a good video store so i can get a good movie .
and a pack of cigarettes .
cute cat .
what's its name?
annoying customer .
fucking dickhead .
can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers sometimes?
let me borrow your car .
may i be blunt with you?
if you must .
we are employees of quick stop convenience and rst video , respectively .
as such , we have certain obligations that , although they may seem cruel and unusual ,
does mean manning the store until closing .
i see .
so playing hockey and attending wakes are standard operating procedures?
there's a difference .
those are obligations that couldn't have been met at any other date .
now , renting videos , that's gratuitous , not to mention illogical , being that you work at a video store .
are you open?
yes .
i don't care for your rationale . it's gonna have to do , being it's my car up for request .
can i help you?
a pack of cigarettes .
what's your point?
my point is , you're a clerk , paid to do a job .
you can't just do anything you want while you're working .
space alien revealed as head of time warner .
report stock increase .
they print any kind of shit in this paper .
they certainly do .
three dollars .
your argument is that title dictates behavior .
what?
the reason you won't let me use your car is because i have a title and job description ,
and i'm supposed to follow it , right?
exactly .
i saw one one time that said ,
the next week , the world is ending .
in the next week's paper , they said ,
we were miraculously saved at the zero hour ... by a koala fish mutant bird .
crazy shit .
so i'm no more responsible for my decisions here than , say , a death squad soldier in bosnia?
that's stretching it .
you're not being asked to slay children or anything .
yeah , not yet .
and i remember one time
i'm gonna break your fucking head , you fucking jerk !
i'm sorry .
he meant to hit me .
yeah?
well , he missed .
here , let me refund your money and we'll call if even , all right?
i'll never come in here again .
and if i see you again , i'm gonna break your fucking head open !
what the fuck did you do that for?
two reasons .
one , i hate it when people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines .
oh , jesus .
and two , to prove a point .
title does not dictate behavior .
what?
lf title dictated my behavior as a clerk serving the public ,
i wouldn't be allowed to spit water at that guy , but i did .
my point is that people dictate their own behavior .
even though i work in a video store , i choose to rent movies at big choice .
agreed?
you are a danger to both the dead and the living .
i like to think i'm a master of my own destiny .
please get the hell outta here .
you know i'm your hero .
sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym .
excuse me?
i heard you strain when you picked up that milk . it only weighs seven pounds .
i didn't strain .
i sighed .
i don't think so .
that was a grunt .
a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles .
i'm a trainer .
i know what that sound signifies .
you're out of shape .
what?
there's no fat on my body .
no fat !
no tone either .
you don't get enough exercise .
you open?
yes .
just the paper .
thirty five .
hey , uh , let me ask you a question .
think this guy's out of shape?
i don't know .
can't really tell from here .
i am i am not !
he is .
how much can you bench?
i don't know .
i'd say about 60 , 70 , tops .
i know i can bench more than that .
three fifty , four .
no way !
feel that .
hey , that's tight .
solid .
yeah .
now feel this .
roll up your sleeve , chief .
oh , for god's sakes !
see , you're ashamed .
you know you're out of shape .
here .
take my card .
i can get you on an aerobics/ free weights program .
are you open?
yes .
i'm not out of shape .
excuse me .
have you been here all day?
yeah , since 6 : 00 this morning .
he's got those love handles .
i don't have love handles !
were you working here about 4 : 00?
yes . it's probably from being around all this food every day .
oh , i know .
if i had to work here all day , i'd be bloated and out of shape too .
i'm not out of shape .
can i have your name , please?
dante hicks .
why?
what's this all about?
you're dante hicks?
oh , my god .
i didn't even recognize you .
because he's out of shape !
do i know you?
yeah .
do you remember alyssa jones?
she used to hang out
with caitlin bree !
i'm her sister .
you're alyssa's sister heather?
yeah .
you , uh , say caitlin bree?
yeah .
pretty girl?
a little taller than her?
gorgeous body?
yeah .
and you're dante hicks .
you went to the same school .
you played hockey .
yeah .
how did you know that?
you still goin 'out with her?
no , she's getting married .
to you?
no .
to an asian design major .
aw , shit !
don't take this the wrong way , but , uh , i used to fuck her .
what?
yeah , about two , three years ago .
while you two were dating .
i drove a black trans am .
you're rick daress?
yeah .
you know him?
yeah .
caitlin used to talk about him all the time .
really?
wait a second .
you used to fuck caitlin bree while i was dating her?
nah , man , don't let it bother you .
that was a long time ago .
i'm surprised you didn't know about it , dante .
everybody in school knew about it .
even in my class .
jesus christ !
what next?
here you go .
what's this?
a fine for $500 .
what?
five hundred bucks?
for what?
for violation of new jersey statute , section 2a , number 170/ 51 .
any person who sells or makes available tobacco , or tobacco related products , to persons under the age of 18 , is regarded as disorderly .
what are you talkin 'about?
an angry mother called the state division of taxation ... and claimed that a quick stop employee ... sold her four year old daughter a pack of cigarettes at 4 : 00 today .
the new jersey division of taxation called the board of health ... and sent me down to issue a fine .
you claimed you were working here all day .
hence , the fine is yours .
the fine is doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child .
but i didn't sell any cigarettes to any kids !
you sold cigarettes to a four year old?
what a scumbag !
that's sick , dante .
i didn't sell cigarettes to any kids !
i swear !
the due date is on the bottom .
this summons cannot be contested in any court of law .
failure to remit before the due date ... will result in a charge of criminal negligence , and a warrant will be issued for your arrest .
have a nice day .
but i didn't sell any cigarettes to any kids .
hey , wait a minute !
forget it .
i don't wanna deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to four year olds .
can i , uh , give you a lift somewhere?
sure .
how 'bout the beach?
i like the way you think .
jesus !
what next?
dante?
what?
caitlin !
<muslc><muslc> [ muzak ]
when did you get home?
just now .
i can't believe it .
i haven't seen you in so long .
dante , you have a customer .
i just saw alyssa's little sister outside .
she was with rick daress .
let's not talk about her .
how'd you get home?
train . it took eight hours .
i can't believe you're here .
excuse me .
do you have
uh , yeah .
back behind the oil .
how long you staying?
until monday .
then i have to take the train back .
pack of cigarettes .
hey , congratulations .
i saw the announcement in today's paper .
you know , she's marrying an asian design major .
so i'm told .
<muslc><muslc> [ hip hop ]
you're just gonna close the store like that?
i wanna talk to you about something , and i don't wanna be disturbed .
something i read in the tabloids .
you saw it .
very dramatic , i thought . it is not what you think .
oh , it's not what i think .
what is it , worse?
you're pregnant with the asian design major's child?
what's goin 'on here?
i am not pregnant .
were you gonna tell me , or were you gonna send me an invitation?
i was gonna tell you , but we were getting along so well , i didn't wanna mess it up .
you could've broken it to me gently .
you could've started by telling me you had a boyfriend .
i told you i had a girlfriend .
i know .
i'm sorry , but when we started talking , it was like i forgot i had a boyfriend .
and then he proposed last month .
and you said yes .
well , kind of .
sort of .
is that what they teach you in that school of yours?
kind of , " " sort of "?
everybody knows about this except me !
do you know how humiliating that is?
i would've told you , and you would've stopped calling me , like a baby .
how do you know that?
because i know you .
you prefer drastic measures to rational ones .
so you're really getting married?
no .
you're not really getting married?
he proposed , i told him i had to think about it , and he insisted that i wear the ring anyway .
then my mother told the paper we were engaged .
oh , how like her .
then my mother called this morning ... to let me know that the announcement was in the paper .
that's when i hopped a train to come back here , because i knew you'd be a wreck .
thanks for the vote of confidence .
was i right?
wreck " is a harsh term .
disturbed " is more like it .
mildly disturbed , " even .
oh , i love a macho facade .
it is such a turn on .
what smells like shoe polish?
so you came here to what?
to comfort me?
the last thing i needed was for you to think i was hiding something from you .
but you were !
no , i wasn't !
not really .
i told you i'd been seeing other people .
yeah , but not seriously .
christ , you're ready to walk down the aisle .
i think that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody .
what's going on?
i'm giving him his ring back .
what?
i don't want to marry him .
i don't want to get married now .
i'm on the verge of graduation .
i want to go to grad school after this , and then i want to start a career .
i don't want to be a wife first and then have to worry about ... when i'm gonna fit in the other stuff .
i have come way too far and studied too damn hard ... to let my education go to waste as a housewife .
and i know that's what i'd become .
sang's just signed with a major firm , and he's gonna be pulling in a huge salary , which would give me no reason to work .
he's very traditional .
wait a minute .
his name is " sang "?
past tense?
stop it .
he's a nice guy .
well , if he's so nice , why aren't you marrying him?
i just told you .
there's more to this , isn't there?
oh !
why , mr. hicks , whatever do you mean?
tell me i don't have something to do with it .
you have nothing to do with it .
oh , you lie !
look how full of yourself you are !
i just believe in giving credit where credit's due , and i believe i'm the impetus behind your refusal to wed .
if i'm so nuts about you , then why am i having sex with an asian design major?
oh , jesus .
you're so caustic .
i had to knock you down from that cloud you were floating on .
when i say i don't want to get married , i mean just that .
i don't want to marry anybody .
not for years .
who's asking?
i don't want to marry you .
well , good .
keep in that frame of mind .
well , let's date .
oh , i think sang and ...
veronica , they'd love that .
we can introduce the two of them .
they may hit it off .
you're serious?
you wanna date again?
i wanna be your boyfriend , yes .
it's just the shock of seeing me after three years .
believe me , you'll get over it .
give me a bit more credit .
i think it's time we got back together .
i'm more mature , you're more mature .
you're finishing college .
i'm already in the job market .
you work in a market , all right .
cute .
tell me you wouldn't wanna go out with me again ... after all the talking we've been doing .
the key word here is " talk , " dante .
i think the idea , or the conception of us dating , is a lot more idyilic than what actually happens when we date .
what are we supposed to do?
pretend over the phone we're dating?
i don't know .
maybe we should just see what happens .
let me take you out tonight .
on a date?
yeah , a real date .
dinner and a movie .
oh , the " dante hicks dinner and movie " date .
i think i've been on that one before .
do you have a better suggestion?
well , how 'bout the " caitlin bree ...
walk on the boardwalk , then get naked somewhere " kind of private date?
i hear that's kind of a popular date .
jerk !
god , here i am , throwing myself at you , succumbing to your wily charms , and you're calling me a slut in so many words .
what about sing?
sang !
he's not invited .
he's your fianc .
i'm offering you my body , and you're offering me semantics .
he's just a boyfriend , dante , and in case you haven't gotten the drift ... of why i came all the way here from ohio
duh !
i'm about to become single again .
and , yes , allow me to placate your ego .
you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision ... that will probably get me ostracized from both school and home .
you ask me who i choose .
i choose you .
so , what are you saying?
you are such an asshole .
i'm just kidding !
i can already see this is not gonna work out .
i'll ask randal to close up when he gets back .
where is he , anyway?
i thought he'd be at your side like an obedient lapdog .
he went to go rent a movie .
he isn't back yet .
ah , screw it .
i'll close up and leave him a note .
you are too responsible .
but no , i have to go home first .
they don't even know i've left school yet .
and i should break the disengagement news to my mother , which is gonna cause quite a row considering she loves sang .
who doesn't?
well , me , i guess .
so i shall take my leave of you , but i will return in a little while , at which time , yes , i would love to go for dinner and a movie with you .
what happened to the walk and the nakedness?
i'm easy , but i'm not that easy .
see you later , handsome .
yes !
<muslc><muslc> [ hip hop ]
get to work .
hey , what'd you rent?
best of both worlds?
hermaphroditic porn .
starlets with both organs .
you should see the box .
beautiful chicks with dicks that put mine to shame .
and you rented this?
hey , i like to expand my horizons .
i got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor .
no way .
five hundred dollars .
you're bullshittin '.
no , i'm not .
holy shit !
i didn't even think they enforced this .
living proof .
i thought you never sold cigarettes to kids .
i didn't .
you did .
really?
yep .
a little girl , maybe four years old .
holy shit !
that girl?
yeah , as opposed to hundreds of other children ... you've sold cigarettes while working here .
then how come you got the fine?
'cause i'm here .
you're lyin '.
no , i'm not .
why aren't you screaming at me now?
'cause i'm happy .
i'm happy .
you're happy to get a fine?
no , because caitlin came to see me .
now i know you're lyin '.
i'm not .
she just left .
what'd she say?
she's not marrying that guy .
she went home to tell her mom .
you're kiddin '.
i'm not .
well , you've had quite an evening .
she went home and she's getting ready and we're going out .
i feel so ineffectual .
is there anything i can do for you?
watch the store while i go home and change?
what happened to " title dictates behavior "?
well , this is my way of spitting water at life .
all right .
you want me to bring the vcr over so we can watch this?
no , i might be leaving early to go out with caitlin , in which case , you're gonna lock up the store tonight .
all right , but you're missin 'out .
chicks with dicks .
<muslc><muslc> [ " berserker " on tape deck ]
uh , no .
oh .
well , randal graves , scourge of the video renter .
ladies and gentlemen , miss asian design major herself , caitlin bree .
you saw that article?
god , isn't it awful?
my mother sent that in .
i take it she likes the guy .
you'd think she's marrying him .
what are you watching?
children's programming .
what'd your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
she said not to come home until after graduation .
wow !
you got thrown out for dante?
what can i say?
he does weird things to me .
ooh , can i watch?
you can hold me down .
can i join in?
you might be let down .
i'm not a hermaphrodite .
hey , few are .
what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with him this time around?
a woman's intuition .
something inside of me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try .
wow !
hey , you know , you and i have something in common .
we both eat chinese .
dick .
exactly .
so where is he?
he went home to change for the big date .
god , isn't he great?
no .
this is great .
oh , lord .
can i use your bathroom?
there's no lights back there .
why aren't there any lights?
there are , but for some reason they stop working at 5 : 14 every night .
you're kidding .
nobody can figure it out .
the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it ...
'cause the electrician owes money to the video store .
such a sordid state of affairs .
and i'm caught in the middle , torn between my loyalty for the boss and my desire to piss with the lights on .
well , i'll try to manage .
oh , hey , caitlin?
break his heart again this time , and i'll kill ya .
nothing personal .
you are very protective of him , randal .
you always have been .
territoriality .
he was mine first .
oh , that was so cute .
who eats cock?
bunch of savages in this town .
hey , caitlin's in the back .
you might want to check on her .
she's been back there a long time .
there are no lights back there .
i told her that .
she said she didn't need any .
why don't you go join her?
make a little bathroom bam bam .
oh , i love your sexy talk .
it's so kindergarten .
" poo poo , " " wee wee .
fuck you .
i said stop .
oh , god .
how did you get here so fast?
i left like an hour ago .
do you always talk this weird after you violate a woman?
maybe the asian design major slipped her some opium .
could be . it has never been like that before .
like what?
when you just lay perfectly still and let me do everything .
am i missing something here?
okay .
i went back there and dante was already waiting for me .
he was? it was so cool .
he didn't say a word .
he didn't have to .
he was just ... ready .
you know .
and , like , we didn't kiss or talk or anything .
he just sat there and let me do all the work .
you dog !
i didn't even see you go back there .
the fact that there weren't any lights on made it so
god , that was so great !
my legs are still shaking .
it wasn't me .
yeah , right .
who was it , then?
randal?
was it you?
i was up here the whole time .
you two better quit it .
i'm serious .
oh , so we didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
no .
stop it .
this isn't funny .
i'm not fooling around .
i just came in from outside .
this isn't fucking funny , dante .
i'm not kidding .
who went back there?
nobody .
i swear .
i feel nauseous .
are you sure there was someone back there?
well , i didn't just fuck myself !
jesus christ !
god , i'm gonna be sick !
you just fucked a total stranger?
shut the fuck up !
i can't believe this .
call the police .
why?
no , don't !
there's a stranger in our bathroom !
he just raped caitlin !
she said she did all the work .
will you shut the fuck up?
who the fuck's in our bathroom?
who is he?
i don't know .
he just came in and asked to use the bathroom .
what time was this?
i don't know .
what time did hockey end?
um , like 3 : 00 , 3 : 30 .
what time we get back from the funeral?
4 : 00 , i think .
wait .
who was working here?
just me .
i thought you just said you went to play hockey and then went to a funeral .
yeah , we did .
then who was operating the store?
nobody . it was closed .
with this guy locked in here?
well , everything happened so quickly , i guess i forgot he was back there .
can we take it now?
go ahead .
was he alive when caitlin
no .
i place the time of death about 3 : 20 .
then how could she you know .
the body can maintain an erection after expiration , sometimes for hours .
did he have the adult magazine when he came in?
uh , no .
i gave it to him .
he asked me for it .
i can't say for certain until we get him back to the lab , but my guess is ... he was masturbating , his heart seized and he died .
that's when the girl found him .
uh , something smells like shoe polish .
this has got to be the weirdest thing you've ever been called in on .
actually , i once had to tag a kid that broke his neck trying to put his mouth on his penis .
what about caitlin?
shock trauma .
she's gonna need years of therapy after this .
how did she come to have sex with a dead man?
she thought it was me .
what kind of convenience store do you run here?
<muslc><muslc> [ humming " theme from jaws " ]
salsa shark .
we're gonna need a bigger boat .
man goes into cage , cage goes into salsa .
shark's in the salsa .
our shark .
oh , what?
what's with you , man?
you haven't said anything for , like , 20 minutes .
what the hell's your problem?
this life .
" this life "?
why do i have this life?
have some chips .
you'll feel better .
i'm stuck in this pit , working for less than slave wages , working on my day off .
the goddamn steel shutters are closed .
i deal with every backward assed fuck on the planet .
i smell like shoe polish .
my ex girlfriend is catatonic after fucking a dead guy , and my present girlfriend has sucked 36 dicks .
thirty seven .
my life's in the shitter right now , and if you don't mind , i'd like to stew a bit .
you open?
yeah .
aw , that's all bullshit , man .
you know what the real problem here is?
i was born?
you should shit or get off the pot .
i should shit or get off the pot .
yeah , shit or get off the pot .
what are you talking about?
i'm talking about this thing you have , this inability to improve your station in life .
fuck you ! it's true , man .
you sit there and blame life for dealin 'you a cruddy hand , never once accepting responsibility for the way your situation is .
what responsibility?
all right , if you hate this job and the people ... and the fact that you have to come in on your day off , why don't you quit?
like it's that easy . it is .
you just up and quit .
there's other jobs .
they pay better money .
you're bound to be qualified for at least one of 'em .
so what's stoppin 'you?
leave me alone .
oh , you're comfortable , right?
this is a life of convenience for you , and any attempt to change it ... would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself .
oh !
like your life's any better .
i'm satisfied with my situation for now .
you don't hear me complaining .
you , on the other hand , have been bitching all day .
thank you .
why don't you go back to the video store? it's the same thing with veronica .
leave her out of this !
you date veronica because it's convenient and she's low maintenance .
but meanwhile , all you ever do is talk about caitlin .
you carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school . in high school , for god's sakes .
you're 22 .
leave me alone !
if you want caitlin , then talk to veronica and be with caitlin .
if you want veronica , then be with veronica .
but don't pine for one and fuck the other .
man , if you weren't such a fucking coward
if i wasn't such a fucking coward .
it must be great to have this ability to simplify things the way you do .
am i right or what?
you're wrong !
things happened today .
things that probably ruined my chances with caitlin .
oh , what , the dead guy?
she'll get over fuckin 'a dead guy .
shit , my mom's been fuckin 'a dead guy for 30 years .
i call him " dad .
caitlin and i can't be together .
it's impossible .
melodrama comin 'from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement .
what do you want me to say?
yes , some of the things you're saying are true "?
that's the way things are .
they're not gonna change .
make 'em change .
i can't , all right?
jesus , will you leave me alone?
i can't make changes in my life like that . lf i could , i would .
but i don't have the ability to risk the comfortable situations ... on the big money and the fabulous prizes !
who are you kidding?
you can so .
jesus h. christ !
i can't !
so you're gonna be miserable 'cause you don't have the guts to face change?
my mother told me once that when i was three years old , my potty lid was closed , and instead of me lifting it , i shit my pants .
lovely story .
the point is , i'm not the type of person ... who'll disrupt things just so i can shit comfortably .
<muslc> noise , noise , noise smokin 'weed , smokin 'weed <muslc>
<muslc> doin 'coke , drinkin 'beers <muslc> pack o '" rass , " my good man .
time to kick back , drink some beers and smoke some weed !
done poisoning the youth for today , huh?
hell , yes , whatever that means .
now it's time to head over to atlantic , drink some beers , get ripped and , hopefully , get laid .
one seventy nine .
pay the good man .
yeah , you close soon? in half an hour .
yeah , we get off the same time every day .
we should hang out .
you get high?
i should start .
wanna come to this party tonight?
there's gonna be some pussy there .
with you?
i don't think so .
oh , look at you .
i don't hang out with drug dealers .
nothing personal .
what happened with that old guy?
he died in the bathroom .
i heard he was jerkin 'off or something .
i don't know .
i wasn't watching .
he probably saw that caitlin chick .
i know i felt like beatin 'it when i saw her .
oh , come here , bitch .
you like this?
huh?
this what you want?
knock it off .
that used to be my girlfriend , all right?
oh , you used to go out with her?
yeah , well , i thought we might be starting again .
don't you already have a girlfriend?
yeah , veronica .
and what , you're gonna dump her for that caitlin chick?
maybe .
i don't know , dude .
that caitlin chick's nice , but i see that veronica girl ... doin 'shit for you all the time .
i saw her rubbin 'your back , fuckin 'comes and brings your food .
didn't i see her change your tire once?
hey , i jacked up the car .
all she did was unloosen the nuts and put the tire on .
well , i know she does a lot for you .
she's my girlfriend .
i had some girlfriends too , but all they wanted from me was weed and shit .
shit , my grandmother used to say , " what's better?
fuckin 'a good plate with nothin 'on it?
no , wait .
i fucked up .
what's a good plate with nothin 'on it?
meaning?
i don't know .
she was senile .
she used to fuckin 'piss herself all the time ... and shit herself .
come on , silent bob .
let's get the fuck outta this fuckin 'gyp joint ... with this fuckin 'faggot dante .
you cock smoker .
you know , there's a million fine lookin 'women in the world , dude , but they don't all bring ya lasagna at work .
most of 'em just cheat on ya .
come on , limp dick !
yeah , yeah , yeah .
he's right .
i love her .
so that's it .
he doesn't love you anymore .
he loves caitlin .
and he told you all of this?
pretty much .
all except the latent homosexuality part .
that's just my theory .
uh i don't know what to say .
don't hold it against him .
he just never got caitlin out of his system .
it's not your fault . it's dante .
i look .
i don't know thing one about chicks .
so if you gotta cry or something , i can get outta here .
i'm not sad .
you're not?
ow !
what'd you do that for?
if you didn't wanna go out with me anymore , why didn't you say so?
instead you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back !
what are you talking about?
you've been talking to her on the phone for weeks ! it was only a few times .
then you pull that shit this morning , freaking out because i've gone down a couple of guys .
oh , a couple?
i'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex , sneaking around behind your back !
if you think 37 dicks are a lot , just wait and see , mister .
i'm going to put the hookers in times square to shame with all the guys i go down on now !
will you let me explain?
explain what?
how you've been waiting until the time was right , and then you were going to dump me for her? it isn't like that !
damn right it isn't like that !
because i won't let it be like that .
you want your slut?
fine , the slut is yours .
i don't want caitlin .
you don't know what you want !
but i'm not going to sit here holding your hand anymore until you figure it out !
i've tried with you , dante .
i've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school , to take charge of your life and find direction .
i even transferred so maybe you'd be more inclined ... to go back to college if i was with you .
everyone said it was a stupid move , but i didn't care ... because i loved you and wanted to see you ... pull yourself out of this senseless funk that you've been in ... since that whore dumped you oh , so many years ago .
now you wanna go back to her so she can fuck you over some more !
i don't wanna go back  of course not !
not now !
you're caught , and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do !
well , i won't let you .
i want you to follow through on this so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are !
and when she dumps you again and i promise you , she will
i want to laugh in your face so you realize that ... that was what you gave up our relationship for !
i'm just glad that randal had the balls to tell me since you couldn't !
randal?
and having him tell me , that was just the weakest move ever .
you're spineless !
veronica , i love you !
fuck you !
dante?
<muslc> our problems seem a world away <muslc>
<muslc> close your eyes <muslc>
<muslc> and they'll all go away <muslc>
<muslc> close the night and listen <muslc>
<muslc> close your eyes to me <muslc>
<muslc> and sell the lie <muslc>
<muslc> my face <muslc>
<muslc> shall live <muslc>
<muslc> you'll all be replaced <muslc><muslc>
how's your eye?
the swelling's not that bad , but the f. d. s. stings .
how's your neck? it's kinda hard to swallow .
you didn't have to choke me , you know .
why did you tell veronica that i was gonna dump her to go back with caitlin?
i thought i was doing you a favor .
oh , jesus .
you're always saying how you can't initiate change yourself .
i thought i'd give you a hand .
thanks .
you still didn't have to choke me .
oh , please .
i'm surprised i didn't kill you .
why do you say that?
why do i say that?
randal [ sighs ]
forget it .
no , really .
what did i do that was so wrong?
what don't you do?
sometimes i think the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable .
how do you figure?
what time did you get to work today?
like 10 : 00 , or ten after .
you were over a half an hour late .
and then all you do is come in here .
yeah , to talk to you .
which means the video store is ostensibly closed !
oh , it's not like i'm miles away .
unless you're out renting video at other video stores .
hermaphrodites .
i rented it so we could watch it together .
you get me slapped with a fine .
you argue with the customers , and i have to patch everything up .
you get us thrown out of a funeral by violating the corpse .
then to top it all off , you ruin my relationship .
i mean , what's your encore?
do you , like , anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank?
you know what the real tragedy about all of this is?
i'm not even supposed to be here today !
oh , fuck you !
fuck you , pal !
jesus , there you go , trying to pass the buck .
i'm the source of all your misery .
who closed the store to play hockey?
who closed the store to go to a wake?
who tried to win back his ex girlfriend ... without even discussing how he felt with his present one?
you wanna blame somebody?
blame yourself .
i'm not even supposed to be here today .
you sound like an asshole !
jesus , nobody twisted your arm to be here .
you're here of your own volition .
you like to think the weight of the world rests on your shoulder ,
like this place would fall apart if dante wasn't here .
jesus , you overcompensate for having what's basically a monkey's job .
you push fuckin 'buttons .
anybody could waltz in here and do our jobs .

you know , that guy jay's got it right .
he has no delusions about what he does .
us , we like to make ourselves seem so much more important ... than the people that come in here to buy a paper or , god forbid , cigarettes .
we look down on them as if we're so advanced .
well , if we're so fuckin 'advanced , what are we doin 'workin 'here?

you wanna grab a bite to eat or something ... when you're done with that and i get off work?
i'll give you a call , let you know .
all right .
hey , good luck with veronica .
lf you want , i can talk to her , try and straighten this  no , thanks .
i think i can handle it .
