who's your new friend?
she sure is fii ne .
yes , fii ne .
what's your name?
sherman , suddenly i don't feel so well .

onesecond , please .
lgotta talk toyou .
we gonna have a little boy talk .
excuse us .
sherman , how you doing , baby?
what do you want here?
a little respect .
you left me all by myself in that test tube ... without a card or a letter , and now i want a divorce .
and this is a community property state , so i want my share .
want your share ofwhat?
the youth formula we invented !
you mean , the youth formula that i invented .
oh , no way , buddy , no way .
who you grounding , fat boy?
you grounding me?
lhaven't grounded
i was hoping we could do this like gentlemen .
come on , sherman .
you're gonna make me do something nasty to you , sherman .
i'll do something nasty .
sherman !
seeyousoon , sherman !
sherman !
sherman !
what the hell are you looking at?
oh , thankyou , sherman .
what else did i get from sherman?
what does this say?
phleer pharmaceuticals . " $1 50 mill $1 50 million .
i think buddy's going shopping .
professor , i got here as fast as i could .
i've got to hide this formula before buddy gets to it .
goodidea .
i found something i thinkyou should look at .
when i left here last night , everthing was fii ne .
i mean , this was not here .
good lord .
buddy must've recombined from the genomic sequence i extracted .
this doesn't make any sense .
he'sjust a fragment of genetic information .
he's nothing without a strand of dna to graft himselfonto .
where where did he get it?
mm .
just a second here .
buster !
thankyou so much .
leanne guilford .
president ofacquisitions .
buddy love , president of love industries .
allergies?
no .
do you have a dog?
yes , i do a yorkie .
oh .
she's driving me crazy right now .
bitch .
excuse me .
it's a female dog that you have , and she's in heat , right?
yes .
how did you know that?
let'sjust say i have a sixth sense about those things .
is this her?
yeah , little courtney .
ooh , nasty .
mr. love , maybe we'd better do this another time .
no , this is the perfect time .
let's do this right now .
this is the perfect time to talk about my youth formula .
we are already committed to purchasing professor klump's formula .
oh , professor klump's formula?
that's if it works .
let'sjust that although he's a brilliant scientist , at times , he can be unstable .
yes .
huh .
interesting .
yes , now , my formula works ... and can be yours for the price of $1 49 million , ifyou act now , pretty lady .
forgive me for being blunt , but you don't expect me tojust take your word for it , do you?
oh , no , not at all .
just say when , and i'll make it available to you .
all right .
if klump can't deliver and you can prove your formula's better , yes?
phleer would have to seriously consider it .
is that right?
i've got to go to a meeting .
can we reschedule for later?
we certainly can .
good .
how about wednesday , 7 : 00?
perfect .
wednesday at 7 : 00 .

huh?
oh !
goodgod !

i went on the paper !
genetic anomalies can occur ... in any living organism through through
come on now , people .
spontaneous mutation .
now what is it that ourgenetic codes can determine about us?
miss tate?
uh , they can determine ... whetheryou have blue eyes or pouty lips or a cute butt .
stufflike that .
right , right , precisely .
ver good .
but what about random nucleotide polymorphisms , professor?
excellent question .
random nucleotide polymorphisms
random nucleotide polymorphisms
random nucleotide [ clears throat ]
i ain't got a clue .
who knows?
this couldaffect yourcoordination , yourneurologicalsystem .
lmean , it could even affect yourintelligence .

jason , yes , please , come in .
look , lknowyou think you're feeling fine , but lran some more tests anyway .
really?
yeah .
whenyou extractedbuddy , somehow it altered the gene that regulates neurotransmitter activity to the cerebral cortex .
uh, jason , all these big words are really perplexing to me .
can you talk in plain english?
you're losing your intelligence , sir .
yeah .
yeah , i know .
i know .
i can feel it .
i can't even beat molly , and she's the dumbest hamster we got .

lcan .
worried about his presentation?
that's a good one there .
ooh , is this supposedto be that hard?
yeah , let it set a while .
don't worr if it burns a little bit .
that's natural .

the other day , i got out the shower , and i bent down to reach for a towel , and i felt a sharp pain in my chest .
shot through my chest and up around my back , down my spine .
i thought , " oh , lord .
i thought i was dying .
i bent over and looked , and i was standing on my own titty .

clesius , have you ever heard the expression , " mercy hump "?

oh .
ah  you girls are crazy .
i'm leaving .
oh , clesius , clesius , wait !
clesius !
oh , clesius !
i don't believe it .
clesius , i only told her 'cause she got so much experience in sexual matters .
i ain't nothing but a big damn joke to you , ain't i?

her husband ain't nothing but a big ol 'pile ofworthless crap !
clesius !
clesius !
oh . [ classical ]
i'm just glad they're back in town so you can fii nally meet them .
i'm extremely nervous because i really want to make a good impression .
sherman , there's no reason foryou to be nervous .
my parents are ver down to earth people , and they're gonna love you .
i guess it's not like they're rocket scientists .
well , actually , they are .
daddy !

screw the golden years .
and here's to youth !
that's some nasty mess .
i don't feel no [ gagging ]
damn , that was some nasty stuff !
oh , i feel as strange as hell .
oh !
hey , get your ass
who the hell are you?
who you put
it worked .
it worked !
papa'sgot a brand newbag [ continues ]
yeah !
oh , what a beautiful bird .
oh , crackers has been in our family more than 50 years .
hmm?
fifty years .
he's older than i am .
sherman , your fly .
your fly .
yeah , he can fly all over .
no , no , no , zip your pants .
oh , my goodness .
excuse me .
i felt i felt a little breeze .
so , uh , genomic extractions .
fascinating .
but the whole concept ofremoving faultygenes must haveyou in an ethicalquandary . .
e excuse me .
ethical?
oh , yes , ldon't knowmuch about " ethicals " , to be perfectly honest withyou .
but the " quandar " i don't like thejapanese cars .
ldon't like the ethicalquandary .
i'm a volvo man myself .
well , yeah .
oh !
sherman is known as the leading expert in genomic extractions .
give us a littlepreviewof thespeechyou're going to make at thepress conference .
say what now?
lknow we wouldnever be able to keep up , but is there some way thatyou could explain it in layman terms?
oh , you'd like me to explain to you?
yes .
well , i would love to .
i would be honored .
it's really quite simple .
this corn , for instance
this piece ofcorn here can represent a strand of dna .
andthese little the individual the bumpy things that go
the green giant calls them " niblets .
uh , niblets .
these niblets represent eachgene , andthey determine everything aboutyou .
for instance , mrs. gaines , let's say ifa person was to have big titties , like you .
sherman !
i'm sorry .
big titties .
no , breasts .
scratch it .
get offyou .
on me .
now , i have a big ass .
never mind that .
what we're attempting to do here is to extract the , uh , the bad , badgenes .
extract that titty out .
andass comes out .
andjust leave thegoodgenes , which is ver simple ifyou think about it .
just ignore that .
please ignore those .
those are the badgenes .
what i'm really tring to do is go deep , deep down into the gene structure , which oftentimes is much more difficult .
crackers !
oh , goodness !
i'm i'm so so sorr about that .
my pants got caught in the thing and they pulled it on out .
his wings is twitching a little bit , so he's allright .
buddy love .
mr. love .
leanne guilford .
