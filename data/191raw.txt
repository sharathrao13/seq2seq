23 . 976
only minutes away from midnight , here at the jade park hotel in hong kong ... ... it's a star studded event , typical of the man they call ... ... the donald trump ofasia , david chan .
what are your last thoughts as the 20th century fades?
tonight , we join the world in celebrating the new millennium .
but , next month , we chinese begin the year of the dragon .
the year 4698 .
has it been that long?
but , seriously , celebrating the new western millennium ... ... it's quite a symbolic moment for china , hong kong and myself .
vitality and creativity of the west , wisdom and experience of the east .
the fun's about to begin , ladies and gentlemen .
please join us .
what is he waiting for?
what are you waiting for?
novak , i'm experiencing the moment .
he's going to experience a chinese labor camp moment ... ... if he doesn't stick to schedule .
we are 10 minutes away , and he's sight seeing .
don't worry about it .
i'm always right on time .
all right , kids .
we're good to go .
got it .
good stuff .
not so good .
thought you said he worked facing the window .
he does .
not today .
he can't see where the infrared port is .
hold on .
you can never pay too much for good intelligence .
or a good hooker .
the ball is up .
we're receiving .
now , please , join with me in counting us down ... ... into china's new future .
ready?
three .
two .
one !
what is it?
what's wrong?
is it y2k?
is it y2k?
no , no .
it can't be .
not in my city !
happy new year !
happy new year .
coming at you .
okay , i got him .
you like?
you like this?
thirteen , 14 year old girls .
sick fuck .
that's good .
did you get that?
yeah .
let's do it .
phone .
here we go .
happy new year , defense minister .
who is speaking?
you could think of me as your conscience .
sending .
maybe you should direct your attention to the big screen .
last month , you took $90 million of un aid money ... ... and spent it on chinese missile technology .
that money was for flood victims and starving children .
i'm sure the north korean government won't mind ... ... but how is the world press going to react to that?
what do you want?
i want you at the negotiating table with south korea tomorrow .
that's impossible .
sending .
just take a look at your monitor .
if it's still an impossibility , press " 1 " on your keypad .
if it's a possibility ...
excellent choice .
i think i've been made .
shaw?
i'm picking up a lot of chatter on the security channel .
the man next to chan is alex wingate .
media mogul .
united states , united europe , united china .
there's no difference .
our blood is 68 percent coca cola .
opening china's doors to the west is a little more complicated than that .
alex , you know we'll try to contribute what we can to make it easier .
and you , sir , who might you be?
me?
i'm eddie murphy .
would you hold this , please?
he hit me !
okay , go to phase 2 .
right .
yeah , i got it .
i know what's coming .
i'm coming in .
line up with the van .
straight approach .
mr. secretary general ... ... can you comment on north korea's return to the peace negotiations?
how were you able to achieve this?
common sense ... ... patience , mutual respect and an abiding understanding that ... ... there are cultural differences .
and we're all gonna live with them .
secretary general douglas thomas leaves the un after a successful return ... ... to peace negotiations for north and south korea .
great .
i'm gonna become another one of those famous canadian peacekeepers .
not famous .
do you know how many americans can name the secretary general of the un?
three percent .
that's all about to change ... ... because the press adore you , and un support is on the upswing .
there'd be hell to pay if they ever found out about your tactics .
i know it's unorthodox , but you cannot deny the results .
if this treaty with china could just go through ... ... the united nations could possibly become a world power .
it could .
nonetheless , i think we should put a cap on covert operations for now .
how's your fellow doing?
he needs a couple of months to recover , but he's in good spirits .
how do you give a medal to someone who doesn't exist ... ... for something that didn't happen?
i wouldn't give up your day job .
well , well , well .
i'm sorry .
i thought it was the other shoulder .
yeah .
sure .
i thought you quit .
i did .
this is my last one .
it's a no smoking court .
okay .
what?
you come down here to do what?
force me into early retirement?
the thought crossed my mind .
yeah .
but to tell you the truth , i was asked to check up on you .
if madam hooks wants to find out how i am ... ... why don't she come down here and see for herself?
you know as well as i do , madam hooks doesn't do anything ... ... without gathering a little intelligence first .
what?
you?
you think you're qualified to test me?
considering your fragile condition ... ... i think i can kick your ass .
okay .
all right .
i'm ready .
you ready?
are you gonna shoot or dribble?
what does it matter to you?
goddamn it !
are you all right?
sorry .
goddamn man , you're bleeding .
it's okay .
no , hold on .
let me take a look .
it's bleeding .
damn .
yeah .
you're gonna need some silk .
that should do it .
a nurse will be with you in a minute to finish .
thank you .
it's a good thing i'm an asshole ... ... otherwise , i'd feel guilty .
you should .
how is it?
he did a nice job .
those people make good doctors .
what?
asians .
chinese .
they're smart and well educated .
and what about these people?
these people have got to stop getting shot on the job .
i can arrange that .
you're too young to retire .
yeah , i'm young , but i ain't dumb .
doesn't that burn?
yes .
frank .
what you got?
fucking thing came off a chinese freighter yesterday .
the longshoremen didn't think much of it .
until the sun came up .
shit .
our forensic guy here picked this up .
i don't speak that language , so i wouldn't know what that means .
translator says it's vietnamese .
talks about the un moving them from some refugee camp in hong kong ... ... looking for a new life in america .
hong kong refugees .
ray !
call amnesty .
see if they can trace these to the ones that disappeared last month .
sure , chief .
thanks .
that's quite a statement , if that's what they wanted to make .
guys !
think it has something to do with the big chinese conference in town?
under un , the supervision .
the fact remains that although these refugees were housed in hong kong ...
... they were under the supervision of un officers .
sweatshop .
you talk of human rights .
three miles from here , sweatshops .
a mile from here , homeless people living in doorways .
yet you lecture my country ... " ... on our human rights record .
the only right that concerns me ...
chinese ambassador jian tze wu .
in two days , china signs a un trade agreement ... ... ending 50 years of isolation , not only culturally , but commercially ... ... opening the door to 1 . 5 billion new consumers .
you think ambassador wu is connected to the dead refugees from the boat?
i have my suspicions .
before becoming un ambassador , he was responsible for refugee resettlement .
here he is meeting with a group of gentlemen tied to various triad concerns .
human smugglers .
slave traders .
exactly .
my instinct tells me something is lurking under the surface .
you always think something's lurking under the surface .
tonight , david chan is hosting a banquet honoring ambassador wu .
you want me to put a wire on wu .
if you're ready .
how's the shoulder?
technically?
fucked up !
there she is .
eleanor !
here .
i've been looking for you everywhere .
i don't believe we've met .
we still haven't , sir .
yes , of course .
would you excuse us , please?
we were watching the security council .
he was going nuts .
yes , i saw .
are you going to do something about it?
he's been briefed .
we're moving forward .
i'm guessing that thomas is not a fan .
on the contrary .
with the achievements of last year ... ... and the chinese trade agreement on the horizon .
thanks to you .
one of the many reasons i can't let you quit .
eleanor , i'm not one to complain ... ... but in the last two years i've been shot twice ... ... i got six broken bones , and i don't even have a health plan .
you know we are owed billions in dues payments .
every un staff member has taken cutbacks .
then , maybe i should make a move before i get cut back ... ... permanently .
find a career .
career?
like what?
cla , nsa?
there's no guarantee .
mcdonalds .
yeah , i'm gonna own one .
yeah .
maybe two .
listen to me .
governments , they come , they go ... ... but the mcdonalds , they last forever .
all right .
your point is taken .
but right now we have a situation that is rapidly deteriorating ... ... into a political time bomb .
no parachutes , no submachine guns , just a simple eavesdropping .
a walk in the park .
this is new york city , baby .
a simple walk in the park can get you killed .
they want to sell us the benefits of free trade !
free trade !
how are trade deals made when there is no accountability for tibet ... ... tiananmen , and dead refugees arrive to our shores like cattle .
stop the un deal !
support human rights in china !
take that .
the un calls it free trade ... ... but this deal is about trade at the expense of freedom .
free tibet !
the magnificent hotel , recently purchased by chinese business mogul , david chan ... ... is alive with diplomats welcoming china into the world trade arena .
i didn't like it .
let's try another one .
the magnificent hotel ...
wait !
hold it !
hold it !
i'm sorry .
your microphone is poking into me .
no , actually , it's not my ...
i'm just messing with you .
greg .
un reporter " , huh?
couldn't get a real job?
smooth .
smooth .
hey !
you're a free spirit .
i don't know how you do it .
first , move from a society that discourages individualism ... ... then move to a city that embraces it , for three years .
it's easy .
i'll take the first shift on the floor .
sure .
a lot of american companies would love unrestricted access to china .
we see this as a major shift in economic powers .
there are two sides to consider , particularly as the chinese are concerned .
that sounds very prudent of you .
the ambassador's been here about a week .
we are on the air .
he's complaining about the menu .
seems he's not a fan of szechwan cuisine , and somebody should have known that .
what?
he doesn't like the pickled pig knuckles?
no?
ladies and gentlemen ... ... thank you for your warm welcome and your presence here this evening .
china and the west began their history together not in war but in trade .
it's trade that brings us together tonight , and it's trade that will bind us ... ... and unite us for years to come .
this agreement brings to fruition ... ... years of hard work by leaders on both sides ... ... driven by a belief that economic prosperity ... ... will forge an era ofpeace that the world has never enjoyed .
marco polo would be proud to know that we go to the next level here .
open the door to the 21st century and announce that , yes ... ... china wants to become a member of the club that'll guide this planet's destiny ... ... into the next 1000 years .
with the signing of the un trade agreement ... ... 1 . 5 billion chinese ... ... will have access to the world markets ...
there will be no future reforms of trade until there's accountability ... ... for criminal aggression !
i'll check him out .
i'm there already .
make that 1 . 4999 billion .
without any further delay , here he is , the architect of china's future ... ... ambassador jian tze wu .
what's he saying to chan?
the level is too low , and he's blocking the bug .
come on , i've got to know .
it's recording .
i'll clean the tape once we're done .
today , i'm very happy to participate in this party .
i'm honored ...
... to open the door of china to the world .
i'm out of the building .
what's going on?
i got him .

shaw , help me !
let's go .
come on .
i'm sorry .
sorry .
that's okay .
you're julia fang , right?
i'm franklin cappella , special agent with the fbl .
you mind if we chat?
you're moved to a five star accommodation ... ... courtesy of the fbl .
you've got the wrong man .
how many jokers do you think we snatch ... ... sprinting along 76th street with a 9 millimeter?
including me?
maybe we should just hand you over to the chinese .
let them kung fu your ass .
it's not him .
thank you very much , miss .
we'll find you , if we need you .
ceramic gun?
clears metal detector nicely .
un credentials .
too difficult to fake .
high tech communication gear , almost government issue which means ... ... we shop at the same store , but only you have a higher limit on your credit card ... ... which makes sense for a ... ... cla officer?
army lntel?
foreign government?
just feel free to chime in at any point , i'll just keep on talking .
the point is , greg , that we have dead chinese refugees ... ... and we have a dead chinese ambassador .
i don't need a fortune cookie to tell me that someone wants to put the kibosh ... ... on the , what do you call it?
the chinese trade agreement type deal .
what's going on?
go !
go !
go !
son of a bitch !
cock sucking assholes !
i'm too fucking old for this .
goddamn it !
shit !
tensions flared with news of the ambassador's assassination .
meanwhile , in an unusual move , the fbl's withholding the identity ... ... of the assassin who fled captivity last night in a daring escape .
you check your e mail?
i'll have to call you back .
give me the phone .
ls everything all right?
listen .
transfer the call .
we're both here now .
the un is running a secret unit that assassinated china's ambassador ... ... to the united nations .
this will be the news story of the week , and will damage the un permanently .
unless?
unless the chinese trade agreement dies on the table .
we don't have the power to kill it .
others do .
we don't .
nevertheless , you have 24 hours .
kill the treaty .
why?
who stands to gain by that?
it's the way we would've done it .
what are you talking about?
the blackmail .
our own techniques being used against us .
your techniques .
i told you this would come back to haunt us .
there is no free lunch .
you have to pay the piper .
i want everything to stop immediately .
i don't want anything to happen ... ... without my consultation and my permission .
mr. secretary , i must insist ...
no , you listen to me .
who is this man?
the assassination of chinese ambassador wu ... ... could not have come at a worse time for u. s. china relations .
un representatives are concerned that the incident could delay ... ... the chinese trade agreement .
but others fear more permanent damage to relations between the two countries .
businessman david chan is recovering at a downtown hospital .
his doctors made a briefstatement a few hours ago .
mr. chan is resting comfortably .
the bullet was removed from his arm without complication .
wagner?
hey , baby .
i think you got something for me .
same caliber that took out ambassador wu .
i'm sure greg brogan's prints are on it .
so our boy gets rescued by these triad assholes ... ... punctures one of them in the melon , and renders the others into chinese salsa .
do you ever watch wrestling , ray?
sure .
i mean , now and then .
because this is just like wrestling .
how?
it's reality mixed with illusion , mixed with bullshit , mixed with ... ... big scary guys from parts unknown in dire need of psychiatric care .
have it your way .
thank you .
now .
the level is too low , and he's blocking the bug .
it's good to see you , too .
why do police believe the man you saw is the killer when you said he wasn't?
would you comment on rumors linking you with the suspect romantically?
miss fang?
may i have a word with you?
no .
don't you have a certain fugitive to apprehend?
no .
i just want to talk to you for a second .
this is harassment .
i'm just trying to protect you , ma'am .
from who?
our fugitive friend is mixed up with the triads .
you know what that means .
my best friend is dying up there .
if you want to help , find the person who tried to choke the life out of her .
okay .
if you want to call me , there's my card .
fuck !
help !
somebody help me !
go , girl .
go .
go .
come on .
in the car .
move over .
not a word .
move on .
not a word .
who do you work for?
who do you work for?
are we just going to sit here !
please , stop that .
no .
no?
i've got you figured out .
you do?
you think i don't see you're as scared as i am?
the reason you won't say what's going on is you don't know either .
all right .
that's enough .
okay?
all right?
what are you?
some kind of government agent?
translate this for me and you go free .
free?
free to go where?
all right .
play it again .
this is ambassador wu .
yes .
he's saying that the dead refugees ... ... were a deliberate action ... ... to derail the trade agreement .
and he knows who is responsible .
who's he talking to?
he got here too late .
she was already dead .
so he took it out on a triad stiff .
jana novak .
her passport is czech .
her file came up blank .
same as our guy .
same dead end .
weird same .
weird .
phone records you asked for .
there's definitely a pattern showing up here .
you mean other than half a dozen dead bodies?
yeah , look .
555 3901 .
555 3902 , 555 ...
okay , let's see .
what you've got to do is , you've got to go all the way up to 99 .
isolate the possibles ... ... stake out all the locations , wait for our guy to show up .
bob's your uncle .
that's a good plan , but who's bob?
he's your uncle .
this better be a fucking emergency .
hello?
who is this?
we are unable to complete your call as dialed .
please check the number and dial again .
protests like this one at the u. s. embassy in beijing are causing many to believe ... ... that the un trade agreement will dissolve before it ever starts .
all eyes are on secretary general douglas thomas ... ... to find a peaceful solution to the strained relations between the countries .
you have a monumental crisis emerging , mr. secretary general .
i'm convinced there's only one man in the whole world ... ... who can compel those fellows in beijing to stick with their agreement .
and that man is you , david .
i don't know if you're trying to flatter me or frighten me , sir .
i think what the secretary general is suggesting ... ... is that you can remind all parties involved that , as history has shown ... ... economic prosperity does wonders at keeping the peace .
excuse me , madam hooks , i missed cnn today .
is there a war going on that i'm unaware of?
there's always a war going on .
there's your side , there's theirs ... ... and me in the middle trying to make it look like peace .
the secretary general spoke to the president this morning .
if the situation does not improve ... ... he's prepared to fly in from washington tomorrow ... ... and attend the ceremony himself , as a show of support for the agreement .
it's a last resort .
i don't want it to happen .
i want this to be a united nations 'initiative .
but , more than anything else , i want it to work ... ... and i'm afraid that , as things stand now ... ... without the president's presence , it can't work .
don't bring in the president .
it'll only complicate things .
in the meantime , we were hoping ... ... that you wouldn't mind acting as interim diplomat .
an ambassador of good will , if you will .
secretary general saves china trade agreement .
excuse me .
eleanor hooks .
you posted a missing cat?
yes .
yes , i did .
you found him healthy?
yes .
you'll need to keep him for a few days .
ls that a problem?
no problem .
i know where to reach you .
asshole !
get a house , you jerk !
internet chat rooms , though they're a free for all ... ... you just have to know where to go .
triads killed wu .
framed me .
possible mole in department .
hold communications and expect cover ...
... to be compromised ...
... within 24 hours .
stay under radar .
good luck .
yeah , good luck .
you work for the un , don't you?
jesus , you do .
go in there and buy some bottled water and some food that we'll keep .
when you come out , there's one more thing you must do .
one more thing?
must be nice for you to assume i will bend over whenever you please .
it's ...
it's bend over backwards .
it's what i meant .
thank you .
i'm trusting you .
i really don't care nothing about it that you're drunk !
but you better cook that food like it's supposed to though .
excuse me .
hello?
ls marie there?
no marie here .
sorry , wrong number .
pay phone?
over ...
i am not through with you !
i keep telling you , don't nobody want ...
get over there !
hi , lo kee bakery .
bingo .
great .
down !
everybody down !
get undressed .
excuse me?
strip .
all your clothes off , now .
you think i'm ...
now !
take your clothes off , now !
you think i'll get undressed for you?
you're bugged .
there's a transmitter in your clothing somewhere .
a transmitter?
how?
i don't know how .
how do you think they tracked us to the diner?
think about it .
they went after you in there .
not me .
take 'em off .
what was that?
you said i was free to go .
you want to go?
okay .
here .
go .
see ya .
thought so .
glasses .
watch .
best i could do .
you're not used to this , are you?
not having control of the situation , being manipulated .
you're normally on the other side of the equation .
are you stating the obvious for your own personal enjoyment ... ... or are you moonlighting as a psychic friend?
if i help you , it would follow that i help myself .
okay .
then , help yourself by telling me about ambassador wu .
you said you worked for him for a long time .
ambassador wu was an outsider .
he knew china's future lay in economic growth .
but the party line was to keep a separation with the west .
he believed that the gulf could be crossed .
what gulf?
i'm talking about appearances and meaning .
frankly , i thought you'd be more sensitive to this concept .
who are you calling?
you tell me .
lo kee bakery .
okay , it's a front .
for what?
this is an athletic club .
a private gentleman's club for gambling and ...
and?
and sex .
you're late !
where's one of the moron brothers?
where are you guys?
frank , my clients are waiting .
you'll be able to hear me with this .
and you'll be able to talk to me ... ... with this .
i need your help .
help me find what i'm looking for , okay?
what are you doing?
i don't have time to worry about you .
where would i go?
i don't know .
a place i haven't thought of .
tell me why my helping you is conditional on being a prisoner .
you're not a prisoner .
i'm protecting you .
from yourself .
one of these days , you'll have to tell me how you know about this place .
julia?
you awake?
i'm awake .
i was just in a different place .
can we stick to the present?
you know , i read a book once about these prisoners of war ... ... who construct the house of their dreams in their head ... ... to keep their sanity .
sanity?
i thought you lost that a long time ago .
right now i'm sitting at a cafe , in a small village ... ... in the south of france .
there's a familiar face .
there's cops pulling up everywhere .
did you hear what i said?
yeah .
party's over .
did you need any help with those?
we have a full license .
you got a fucking license?
we'll just be on our way then .
you're in way over your head , boy .
we have an understanding with the police .
well , now you have an understanding with the fbl .
i said assume the fucking position .
assume position .
i'm not going anywhere .
you kung fu motherfucker !
didn't you hear that officer talk to you?
what's wrong with you?
get over here .
give me those .
get up the stairs with your bitch ass .
let's get their names .
get them out of here .
come on .
sometimes it's hard to tell the difference between the good guys and the bad guys .
it's not always obvious ...
excuse me , miss .
ls this man bothering you?
steel .
left hand .
nice and slow .
all right .
step back .
not exactly fbl waist regulation , is it?
i'm on probation .
okay , cappella , why don't you ask her .
ask her who the bad guys are , and if she wants to walk away with you .
we're both after the same thing .
why can't we work together on this?
because your idea of cooperation is me in a cell .
i don't particularly like that .
i'm just after the truth .
why don't you check out the vietnamese refugees underneath the bakery?
my guess is they're linked to the dead ones you found in the container .
you can be a hero .
i doubt there's a weight requirement for attorney general .
probably not .
probably not?
cappella?
yeah?
thank you .
that club stinks of david chan .
he's in bed with the triads and definitely linked to the refugees .
but i need proof that he took out wu to kill the trade agreement .
i'm not so sure about your theory .
david chan was supporting the trade initiative .
appeared to be .
who benefits the most from wu's death?
besides mrs. wu?
if the trade agreement is signed , chan's business monopoly would be over .
he'd have to compete with the western companies .
kill wu and the un trade agreement with him ... ... chan keeps china to himself .
you make a lot of sense ... ... for a car thief .
okay , just relax .
okay , ready .
log on to the main web site , then follow the instructions i gave you .
wait , the access is denied .
okay , simultaneously press control , alternate , f8 , twice .
backslash .
enter .
password and log in ld .
don't worry .
you don't need it .
just follow the last lines of codes on the page .
department of defense?
julia , look ...
don't tell me .
i don't want to know .
it's just a trick i picked up from some friends i trained with .
did they train you to be this vague?
or is it a gift?
what's that supposed to mean?
you know what i mean .
i mean your evasiveness .
comes with the territory .
the strong , silent type cliche thing is becoming tiresome .
okay , we're in .
okay .
wait a minute .
wait , stop .
what?
rewind .
play it again .
all right , let's go frame by frame .
and look very carefully .
chan's looking before the shot was fired .
i don't believe it .
he knew .
he knew that it was coming?
more like , he made it happen .
all right , make a copy and get back to the car .
twenty four hours are nearly up .
i'm putting the trade deal in the president's hands .
i'm gonna let him run with it .
bringing the president in , sir , seriously undermines your authority .
your strength is what will keep the un strong .
i'm using all my sources .
if anything should leak out , i can kill it .
i feel certain you can keep this deal together and avoid a scandal .
thank you , eleanor .
thank you , but no .
reports state that secretary general douglas thomas ... ... has asked the united states president to intervene ... ... and solidify the chinese trade agreement before it collapses .
the president and the secretary general will address the general assembly ... ... and attend the signing ceremony at the un tomorrow .
if chan's serious about killing this deal , that's where he'll make his next move .
all right .
i want you to take the videotape and wu's recording to eleanor hooks .
she can get it to the right people without bringing me into it .
meanwhile , i'll get the final piece of this puzzle .
finish this once and for all .
where are you going?
the last place i should .
yes , i will .
i'm sorry .
miss hooks is quite busy .
i hope you don't mind waiting .
happy new year .
yeah .
she's ready to see you now .
do you always exhibit such flair at entrances and exits ... ... or is it just when visiting my hotels , mr. shaw?
actually , i find them rather inviting .
kind of like a second home , you know?
as my most effective asset in the field ... ... i'm almost embarrassed that you're not on my payroll .
then maybe you'd like to make me an offer i can't refuse .
i would .
but i'm afraid you would never get to enjoy the rewards .
i guess this is my reward .
excellent , actually .
assassinate the man who's been tracking you .
at the same time , blow apart the trade agreement ... ... that could cost you billions .
i know that nothing is what it seems .
but i'm dying for you to explain this .
if this information were to get out ... ... the scandal could seriously damage china's credibility on the world stage .
do more harm than good .
i never thought of that .
appearances are everything , miss fang .
politics and deception are built on it .
head for the street !
i got him !
mid block .
construction site .
location?
bly !
freeze !
drop your weapon !
i said , drop your weapon !
drop it !
that should do it .
come on !
you're gonna need some silk .
are you all right?
how does it feel to be a puppet without the strings?
win by destroying your enemy from within .
ironic , isn't it ... ... that a 2000 year old strategy would be turned against the people who created it?
better us doing it to them , than them doing it to us .
what are you talking about?
i'm talking about 20 years of china fucking america from within and nobody noticing .
now they're going to notice .
you .
you're behind all this .
with just enough help from david chan to keep everyone guessing .
david chan , most of all .
i don't understand .
of course you don't , my dear ... ... because you , like most people , never stop to look at the big picture .
i've been looking at the big picture everyday for 20 years ... ... and i've tried to look forward .
and you know what i see?
i see china maintaining a stranglehold on freedom ... ... influencing our political process with illegal campaign contributions ... ... stealing our most secret military technology and selling it to our enemies ... ... weakening us from the inside , like a virus .
this trade deal is an invitation to finish the job .
we intend to cancel that invitation .
we intend to return america to americans .
we?
who do you think you are representing?
the people who have steered this nation for decades behind the scenes .
the people who protect democracy from itself .
for a woman obsessed with chinese conspiracies ... ... you sound frighteningly similar to the government you are trying to stop .
thanks for stopping by .
thanks for this useful bit of evidence .
i'm sure you'll find your own way out .
shit , shit .
just think , girl .
julia?
shaw?
julia .
hello?
you're breaking up .
shaw?
move where you can get better reception .
if you can hear me ...
shaw?
move where you can get better reception .
i'm locked in the un building .
hooks is behind everything .
julia?
julia?
shit !
hey , guys !
you call this a perimeter?
come on , wake up !
jesus christ !
cappella .
america's most wanted .
the man of the hour .
why are you calling?
to explain chan's murder or apologize for this afternoon?
both .
you want to meet?
let's meet .
okay .
are you in the area?
with a rookie boy's head in my sights .
really?
i could live with that .
get in your car .
pick me up on the other side of the car park .
no , i got a better idea ...
okay , i get the message .
i've got to go .
what are we gonna do?
i don't know .
figure out something .
do not underestimate your friend .
there's a reason i chose him as team leader ... ... and there's a reason i asked you to deal with him .
you obviously do not appreciate the schedule i'm working with .
i agreed to play neil because i wanted to ... ... not because of the money .
and certainly not because of your right wing ideology .
you let me handle neil .
my way .
this is not about male testosterone between you and your idol .
you were just a cog in the wheel of a larger machine .
it could've just as easily been you out there chasing your own tail .
i understand .
what do you want to do about the girl?
it's almost midnight .
security will be doing a check of the upper floors .
you have a 30 minute window .
what about the guards in the lobby?
i'll take care of them .
yes , ma'am .
what?
drive .
okay .
where's your first aid kit?
security .
yes , ma'am .
attention .
stand by for a motion sensor test ... ... protocol t 7 .
all lobby personnel report to sublevel 1 .
repeat .
lobby personnel stand down for a motion sensor diagnostic .
the trail ends with eleanor hooks .
my guess is that she was using chan , and then she double crossed him .
it's a long story .
just drive .
jesus christ .
this information has to come out to clear your name .
i can't do that .
any connection between wu's murder , chan , the triads and hooks ... ... would kill the trade agreement .
holy shit .
and completely destabilize the un .
damn it , that's it .
that's it !
all she has to do is come clean .
tell the truth .
truth?
the truth about me , about the un covert operations unit , everything .
she pins the assassination on you to discredit the un?
taking out the one organization that could hold it all together .
back to a cold war .
give me your business card .
hello .
roll your window down so i can see .
jesus !
security's not where they're supposed to be .
neither am l .
cappella .
it's for you .
yes .
i have a proposition for you .
come on , sweetheart .
all right , you want to play .
let's have some fun .
the art of war .
sun tzu .
the doomed spy .
does any of this ring a bell?
sacrificing an agent without his knowledge ...
... can turn the battle in your favor .
befriending you , gaining your trust ...
... all the while setting you up to take the fall .
you disappointed me , shaw .
you were always one step behind .
i've got to tell you , my friend .
by the time we're done with you ... ... you're gonna make lee harvey oswald look like a fucking boy scout .
but first , we're gonna have a short class on pacific rim social economics .
the effect of negative chinese population density ... ... and how it relates to the african american world view .
in other words , you're gonna watch me put a bullet in little miss shanghai here .
shit .
i was thinking , neighborhood rules .
sounds good to me .
it's nice when an opponent raises the level of play .
you're too kind .
no , i'm not .
there's still one left in the chamber , amigo .
tell me , master .
what are you gonna do now?
move .
you all right?
hello?
get me out of here !
hello !
here's your paper .
have a nice day , miss hooks .
dramatic .
i'm just reading about your handiwork .
i was thinking of yours .
you betrayed me , eleanor .
shaw .
i thought our eastern associates would've made arrangements for you by now .
staying alive is what you pay me for .
i'm curious .
what makes you think what you did to chan won't happen to you?
i don't like to speak ill of the dead ... ... but between you and me , and whoever's listening ... ... david chan was a self inflated , pig headed asshole ... ... who no doubt deserved whatever came his way .
as for you , shaw ... ... you're still alive .
you just remember , eleanor ... ... what goes around comes around .
sore loser .
max , you missed the entrance .
eleanor hooks was my right hand man .
she was my mentor .
she taught me that a successful road to peace ... ... is founded on a principle of action , not reaction .
she said that if what i believed to be the destiny ... ... of the united nations is to be fulfilled , then we could not afford to wait around ... ... and then react to a member nation's call for help .
we have to anticipate to diffuse volatile national ... ... and international conditions before they became explosive .
before they led us to catastrophe .
it is in the memory of eleanor hooks ...
freeze ! ... that i pledge the commitment of this organization ... ... to a policy ofintervention , a policy ofleadership ... ... a policy of aggressive peacekeeping .
down on your knees !
call the coroner .
ca va bien , madame?
oui , oui .
merci .
c'est la vie .
excuse me , do i know you?
no , i don't think so .
do i know you?
maybe it was in another lifetime or something .
have you eaten?
i have not .
