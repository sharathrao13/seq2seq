the little dudes are just eggs .
we leave 'em on a beach to hatch ... and then , coo coo cachoo ... they find their way back to the big ol 'blue .
all by themselves?
yeah .
but , dude , how do you know when they're ready?
well , you never really know .
but when they know , you'll know , you know?

it's the jellyman !

turtle pile !
wait , wait , wait !
are you funny?
where's your shell?
i need to breathe !
are you running away?
did you really cross the jellyfish forest?
did they sting you?
one at a time !
mr. fish , did you die?
sorry , i was a little vague on the details .
so , where are you going?
you see , my son was taken .
my son was taken away from me .
no way .
what happened?
no , no , kids .
i don't want to talk about it .
aww !
please?
please?
well , ok .
i live on this reef a long , long way from here .
this is gonna be good .
i can tell .
and my son nemo ...
see , he was mad at me .
and maybe he wouldn't have done it ... if i hadn't been so tough on him .
i don't know .
anyway , he swam out in the open water to this boat ... and when he was out there , these divers appeared ... and i tried to stop them , but the boat was too fast .
so , we swam out in the ocean to follow them ...
they couldn't stop 'em .
and then nemo's dad ... he swims out to the ocean , and they bump into ... ... three ferocious sharks .
he scares away the sharks by blowing 'em up !
golly , that's amazing .
and then dives thousands of feet ... ... straight down into the dark .
it's wicked dark down there .
you can't see a thing .
how's it going , bob?
and the only thing they can see down there ... ... is the light from this big , horrible creature ... with razor sharp teeth .
nice parry , old man .
and then he has to blast his way ...
so , these two little fish have been ... searching the ocean for days on the east australian current .
which means that he may be on his way here right now .
that should put him in sydney harbor ... ... in a matter of days .
i mean , it sounds like ... this guy is gonna stop at nothing ... ... till he finds his son .
i sure hope he makes it .
that's one dedicated father , if you ask me .
mine !

hey , sharkbait .
i'm sorry i couldn't stop the ...
no , i'm the one who should be sorry .
i was so ready to get out ... so ready to taste that ocean ...
i was willing to put you in harm's way to get there .
nothing should be worth that .
i'm sorry i couldn't get you back to your father , kid .
all right .
hey , hey , hey ...

aaah !
that's one way to pull a tooth .
huh .
darn kids .
good thing i pulled the right one , eh , prime minister?
hey , psst !
oh , nigel !
you just missed an extraction .
has he loosened the periodontal ligament yet?
what am i talking about?
where's nemo?
i've got to speak with him .
what is it?
your dad's been fighting the entire ocean ...
looking for you .
my father?
really?
he's traveled hundreds of miles , battling sharks and jellyfish ...
sharks?
that can't be him .
what was his name?
some sort of sport fish .
tuna?
trout?
marlin?
marlin !
the little clownfish from the reef .
it's my dad !
he took on a shark !
i heard he took on three .
three sharks?
that's 4, 800 teeth !
after you were taken by diver dan over there ... your dad followed the boat like a maniac .
really?
he's swimming , giving it all he's got ... and then three gigantic sharks capture him ... and he blows them up and dives thousands of feet ... and gets chased by a monster with huge teeth !
he ties this demon to a rock , and what's his reward?
he gets to battle an entire jellyfish forest !
now he's with a bunch of sea turtles on the e. a. c ... and the word is he's headed this way right now ... to sydney !
wow !
what a good daddy !
he was looking for you after all , sharkbait .
he's swimming to the filter !
sharkbait !
not again !
sharkbait !
no !
you got your whole life ahead of you !
we'll help you , kid !
get him out !
get him out of there !
come on , kid !
grab the end !
sharkbait !
no !
can you hear me?
nemo !
can you hear me?
yeah , i can hear you .
sharkbait , you did it !
sharkbait , you're ... covered with germs !
aah !
ha ha !
that took guts , kid .
all right , gang , we have less than 48 hours ... before darla gets here .
this tank'll get plenty dirty in that time ... but we have to help it along any way we can .
jacques?
no cleaning .
i shall resist .
everybody else , be as gross as possible .
think dirty thoughts .
we're gonna make this tank so filthy ... the dentist will have to clean it .
good work !
ha ha ha !
all right , we're here , dudes !
get ready !
your exit's coming up , man !
where?
i don't see it !
right there !
i see it !
i see it !
the swirling vortex of terror?
that's it , dude .
of course it is .
ok , first , find your exit buddy .
do you have your exit buddy?
yes !
squirt give you a rundown of proper exiting technique .
good afternoon !
we'll have a great jump today !
ok , crank a hard cutback as you hit the wall .
there's a screaming bottom turn , so watch out !
remember ... rip it , roll it , and punch it !
he's trying to speak to me , i know it !
you're really cute , but i don't know what you're saying !
say the first thing again .
ok , jellyman !
go , go , go !
whoa !
wahoo !
whoa !
whoa !
whoo !
that was ... fun !
i actually enjoyed that .
hey , look , turtles !
ha ha !
most excellent !
now turn your fishy tails around ... and swim straight on through to sydney !
no worries , man !
no worries !
thank you , dude crush !
bye !

it's me .
right !
it's orange and small ...
it's me .
all righty , mr. smartypants .
and it's orange and small and white stripes ...
me .
and the next one , just a guess , me .
that's just scary .
wait , wait , wait .
i have definitely seen this floating speck before .
that means we've passed it before ... and that means we're going in circles ... and that means we're not going straight !
hey , hey !
get to the surface .
we'll figure it out up there .
let's go !
hey !
relax .
what?
take a deep breath .
now , let's ask somebody for directions .
fine .
who do you want to ask , the speck?
there's nobody here !
there has to be someone .
it's the ocean , silly .
we're not the only two in here .
let's see .
ok , no one there .
nope .
nada .
there's somebody .
hey !
excuse ...
dory , dory , dory !
now it's my turn .
i'm thinking of something dark and mysterious .
it's a fish we don't know .
if we ask it directions ... it could ingest us and spit out our bones !
what is it with men and asking for directions?
i don't want to play the gender card right now .
let's play the " let's not die " card .
you want to get out of here?
of course i do .
how are we gonna do that unless we give it a shot?
dory , you don't fully understand ...
come on .
trust me on this .
