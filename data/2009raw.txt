the news traveled quickly .
there was land to be had , and lots of it .
the reports made western new york sound like paradise , at least to my brother and father , two vermont rock farmers .
87 1/ 2 acres northwest corner of plat 1 3 , palmyra township .
congratulations , mr. steed .
you own one of the finest tracts of land in upstate new york .
congratulations , sir !
thank you .
no , i'm not going !
melissa , this is so
how can father do this?
we don't even know anyone in new york .
you mean you don't know anyone like john connelly .
joshua !
this is very hard on her .
this is hard on all of us .
we do as we're told , right?
let's get on with it !
hyah !
giddyup !
so on the eve of my 1 6th birthday father announced we would move .
he and nathan went ahead , and we would follow in time for spring planting .
we had never heard of palmyra , new york or of a man named joseph smith .
and we had no way of knowing that for the steed family our journey was just beginning .
ben?
ben !
what?
who knows you're here?
no one .
mr. steed !
except my family .
ho !
pa !
pa !
hey , hey , come here .
oh , my goodness , you're heavy .
oh !
welcome home , mrs. steed .
let me see if , uh , i got this right .
joshua's the old one .
not by much .
i hear you're quite the worker .
get more work done than most men times two .
then again , nathan also says that only happens about once a year and only if a young lady is watchin '.
martin's been the best of neighbors .
he helped us survey the property lines .
thank you , mr. harris .
not at all .
i'm just glad you're finally here .
ben's been antsier than a bear in a beehive .
did you miss me , ben?
new englanders , ma'am , they're bunch of hemlock nuts .
he missed you .
what's this , pa?
the steed farm .
put that blasted book away , come on !
yo !
yo !
yo !
giddy up , mules !
not even movin '.
come on !
move 'em .
come on , pull , pull , pull , pull , pull .
haw , haw , haw , haw .
pa !
whoa !
whoa !
whoa !
whoa !
two inches closer .
you alright , pa?
yeah !
thank you , son .
we're going to have to cut more of the roots .
ah , nothin 'will be happenin 'without a decent chain .
josh !
saddle one of the mules and ... and take this in to the blacksmith .
do you hear me , son?
we've been working on this stump all afternoon , and it hasn't budged an inch .
i say we do what everyone else does and leave it and get on with clearing some land .
there will be no stumps on my farm .
now take the chain in and get it fixed .
pa , you was nearly killed .
i say it stays .
ho , ben .
just heading into town .
can i pick up something for you?
no , thank you , martin .
josh is just on his way .
hickory , huh?
hickory is vermont stubborn .
thought we'd never get our place cleared .
it's coming fine .
but if we don't get enough wheat and corn in ... we're gonna have a tough winter .
ever thought of hirin 'help?
spring's comin 'on hard now .
you're going to want to be plantin 'within the month .
got that money left over from the farm sale , pa .
i know a family a mile or two south of town , they got two boys that hire out .
i used them myself and right pleased with their work .
what's their names?
smith .
love this place .
best part of town .
that's why i work here .
my ma and sisters won't come anywhere near here .
yeah , you don't want to bring your ma around here .
hey , this is it .
whoa !
much obliged , steed .
any time , caleb .
sure you don't want to come in and meet the boys?
no , i got to run over to main street .
pick up some help that pa's hired .
and i got a stop to make before that , so ...
a stop?
yeah !
i saw you two at the dance .
careful , steed .
yee ah !
what can i get you?
i got a list of things .
i just need to check out some tools first .
over there .
thanks .
oh , mr. mcbride?
do you know the smiths down on stafford road?
why?
well , my pa has hired two of their sons , hyrum and joseph .
i'm supposed to meet them .
you're new around here .
yeah .
none of my business , but you might want to tell your pa to think about that .
i need some help down here !
mr. steed .
hello , lydia .
how may i help you , mr. steed?
my mother needs a few things .
of course .
it's always a pleasure to help your mother .
you look right pretty today , lydia .
right pretty .
if you'll follow me , sir , um , i'll help you get those things together .
do you know those men?
why?
what do you want with them?
my pa has hired them to clear some land .
i'm supposed to take them up to our place .
hyrum smith .
my brother , joseph .
joshua steed .
joshua , good to meet you .
day labor eating with us?
you know how i feel about that .
we've worked a long day , mary ann .
remember the ones in rutland?
foul mouthed , lazy riffraff .
they're not like that , ma .
you should have seen them .
cleared near a full acre .
could hardly get 'em to stop for supper .
well , becca's smitten .
and matthew adores them .
pull , matthew .
you got me again .
this boy's an ox , mr. steed .
one more?
no , you go help your sister .
you plum wrestled him out , matthew .
he's got nothing left ... for a real man's game .
might be good to show the smith boys here what vermont stubborn really means .
joshua is the champion stick puller in rutland .
never seen anyone stand him up .
you leave joseph and hyrum be .
they worked hard today .
yeah , ma's right .
big slice of humble pie .
doesn't sit well with a good meal .
i like pie .
i'll wager joseph can throw you over three times straight .
loser has to pull out that old hickory stump .
that work must have shook your brains loose .
i thought you were smarter , being older and all .
hey , what do you say , joseph , are you going to stand by your brother?
always .
i don't like this , ben .
well , let's get on with it so the smiths can start digging .
somebody's going to get hurt .
are you just going to sit there and let them do this?
need plenty of room .
don't want anyone having an advantage .
now ...
here's how it works .
three pulls .
first time joshua throws joseph , over .
draw ... for hand position .
you know what?
you can take the outside .
i don't want you to have any excuses when you lose .
okay .
alright , nathan , you might want to move that barrel .
that's exactly where joseph's going to land .
alright , good clean pull .
ready?
ready .
pull !
that's one .
watch your grip , son .
watch your grip .
ready?
pull !
pull , joshua .
that's two .
one more and we're done .
don't let me down , son .
don't let me down .
come on , joseph !
put him in his place , joseph !
ready?
pull !
tomorrow we'll just hook you up to that hickory stump .
spare the mules .
well done , joshua .
it's been a long time since i came that close to being beaten .
yeah .
whoa .
alright , no sense in us all going in .
ah , sure there is .
i can sit on her pa .
joseph can hog tie her ma .
and you can say hello to miss lydia .
go on , get out of here .
we'll be back .
yes?
why , mr. steed .
i didn't know you were in town .
lydia .
good afternoon .
joshua steed .
these are my very best friends in the whole world .
abby pierce .
rilda jane freeman .
ladies .
blast .
you coming to the barn raising saturday?
i'll watch for you .
my brother nathan .
miss lydia mcbride .
pleased to meet you .
i can tell you are a steed .
you look very much like your mother .
i'd better go .
saturday .
yeah !
pleasure to meet you , miss .
well , if it ain't joe smith .
it is old joe himself .
let's go pay our respects .
afternoon , miss lydia .
mr. murdock .
out here learning more about them angels , are ya?
no , just came from a recital .
will murdock .
you must be the new family out by the harris place?
this is my brother , david .
cousin , mark .
joshua .
my brother , nathan .
and joseph , who you seem to already know .
oh , yeah .
we know all about old joe , don't we?
how are you today , sir?
fine , will .
you got that gold bible yet?
ain't joe told you about his gold bible?
shame , joe .
people around here just love that story , especially the part about them angels flying around your house .
heard tell the waiting time is over this fall .
that true?
think your pa will take gold in payment for supplies , miss lydia?
oh , i imagine we'll be buying our things same as other folks .
joe , what does an angel look like?
was it a boy angel or a girl angel?
yeah , why don't you send one of those angels to tell us where to find some buried treasure?
we'll be waitin '... for the gold .
alright , so what's all this about a gold bible and angels?
you really think angels go around showing people where to find buried treasure?
uh uh .
good .
neither do l .
they said something about a gold bible .
when a donkey brays do you think he is always saying something important?
alright !
go !
go !
go !
hyah !
come on !
hyah !
come on !
hyrum !
come on , push .
come on !
hyah !
now ... where's the hard one?
i'll go help unhook it .
watch out for hornets .
so , hyrum .
in town yesterday , some men stopped joseph , said something about a gold bible .
the murdocks .
they also said something about angels .
josh .
it is not our place to pry .
well?
anyone who wants to know about that ... would have to ask joseph .
do you ask this for yourself?
or is it just because of the things you've heard?
the only thing i've heard is what will murdock said .
you mean you haven't heard that joe smith is a lazy , no account drunkard immoral , untrustworthy , utterly unattractive .
well , there may be some truth to that .
maybe you've heard of our family .
how we're all grave robbers , devil worshippers , and the like?
i don't believe any of that .
neither does my family .
thank you .
why would anyone say that?
if we talk , you'll be late for supper .
it's not for an hour .
i'll not ask you to believe what i tell you , nathan .
but i'd appreciate it if you'd hear me through to the end .
you ever been to a camp meeting?
revival?
heard of them , but we never went .
pa says they're organized madness .
that's not far off .
i was about 1 4 when they came to this area .
the bible says god has already decided on who will be saved .
so i admonish each of you to search your hearts to see if god has elected you .
that's false doctrine , reverend !
and we won't stay a minute longer !
so many different faiths .
so many opinions .
so much anger .
i wondered who , of all these parties , are right .
or are they all wrong together?
if any one of them be right , which is it?
and how can i know it?
thank you , dear .
let patience have her perfect work ,
that ye may be perfect and entire , wanting nothing .
if any of you lack wisdom ,
iet him ask of god that giveth to all men liberally
and upbraideth not , and it shall be given him .
but let him ask in faith , nothing wavering .
father ... in heaven .
as i was praying , i saw ... a pillar of light .
it was exactly over my head .
it gradually descended .
when the light rested upon me , i saw two personages .
personages?
yes , two beings .
their brightness and glory defy all description .
one of them spoke to me and called me by name and said ,
this is my beloved son .
hear him .
i saw god , nathan .
and i saw his son , jesus christ .
i know how ... that must sound to you .
but i say again , i saw god the father and i saw his son .
nathan?
what did they look like?
glorious .
beyond description .
the light from them was so brilliant
i thought the leaves would catch fire .
when i finally gathered my senses , you can imagine how i felt .
this is not what i expected .
anyway , i asked which of the churches i should join .
and?
i was told to join none of them .
i've got to get back .
nathan .
i know what you're thinking .
trust your heart on this .
evening .
steed .
joshua .
remember mr. steed?
drink?
good , ain't it?
he holds the shine better than you do , coop .
have a seat , steed .
so ...
why you taking on with joe smith?
i ain't taking on with him .
pa hired him and his brother to clear land .
if it was me , i'd send him packin '.
them smiths is daft lunatics .
people are talking about your family .
wondering if you're taking up with them .
what was that stuff you boys were saying about angels , gold bible?
you ain't heard?
what?
smith says some angel came to him in his room one night and told him where some old book is buried .
joe says it's like the bible .
and it's written on gold plates .
you believe that?
not about the angel .
but suppose there is gold .
and suppose we follow joe when he goes to get it .
there is a lot of treasure buried in these parts .
spanish brought a lot of gold up here .
so if there's gold , then where is it?
buried in a hill down by the smiths '.
the angel said joe needed to wait some before he could get it .
the angel said .
listen , the word is , time's up this fall .
me and the boys , we plan on being there when smith takes out the gold .
ma .
it's early .
it's easter sunday .
couldn't just stay in bed .
pa could .
he had a lot to drink last night .
if you believe miss sloan , so did joshua .
she saw him?
with the murdocks .
oh , that's why he never came home .
your father's gonna have a problem with that .
what are you reading?
john , last part .
remember our new year's resolutions?
mine was to read the four gospels again by easter .
i'm almost there .
mary's just come to the empty tomb .
good place to be reading this morning .
i could have finished yesterday , but i wanted to save it .
if jesus was resurrected , is he still alive?
of course .
as a real being?
a person?
thomas felt his hands and feet .
that's pretty real .
but that was 2, 000 years ago .
so?
could he appear to someone now?
well , he appeared to mary , to paul .
i suppose he could now , why?
nathan?
joshua told you what happened in town the other day , with joseph?
we don't hold with gossip , nathan .
i know , but ... when i walked home with them ...
i asked joseph why people were saying those things about him .
it's none of our affair .
ma , i wanted to know .
he said when he was 1 4 , he was confused about which church to join .
and he read in james ,
i think it was the first chapter , and it said ,
if you lack wisdom , ask of god .
becca , help your sister with the bowls .
happy easter , papa .
well , happy easter to you , matthew .
what time did joshua come in last night?
he's not here .
i'll be back .
ben !
we don't even know where he is .
he's probably on his way home now .
you know , he don't need you stickin 'up for him .
ben !
it's easter morning .
come and eat .
he'll be along .
what are you doing here?
i was looking for you all night .
you looked pretty busy to me .
i was hoping you'd come over .
lydia , we're late !
i have to go .
wednesday , father and mother are going to waterloo .
i'll be staying with my aunt on canandaigua road .
my aunt isn't nearly as strict as father .
will you come?
lydia !
i'll come .
now , upon the first day of the week , very early in the morning , they came unto the se
sepulcher .
sepulcher .
sorry i didn't come home last night , ma .
i was with some friends .
friends?
would that be the murdocks?
matthew , becca , we need eggs .
look at me .
i asked if you thought those two rum soaked pieces of river trash were your friends .
you don't even know them .
everybody else in town seems to know them .
they're tavern rats .
you'd know all about tavern rats , wouldn't you , pa?
we only had to wait but an hour while you and your friends
iifted a few mugs of your own .
joshua !
what did you say?
beg your pardon .
so the little mcbride girl wouldn't give you the time of day , so you go off with your so called friends and get drunk .
you leave lydia out of this .
she's a spoiled daughter of a high minded storekeeper who thinks that farmers like us are no better than stray livestock .
and if you think that you're going to impress her with your patched up trousers and your manure covered boots , then you're a bigger fool than i thought !
ben , that is uncalled for !
how do you know what i did last night?
you chose to be with trash and now people are wondering whether or not joshua steed is trash too .
who cares what people think?
you better care !
you're just worried if joshua steed stinks , someone might think his revered father stinks too !
you'd better watch your mouth , boy .
if you're so worried about what people think , you might want to fire the smiths .
the smiths?
go to town , pa .
listen to what people are saying about joe smith and about you for hiring them .
what are they saying about joseph?
joe says an angel brought him a gold bible and it's buried in some hill somewhere and he's gonna translate it and save the world .
who i hire is my business .
no , pa , you're worried about stink .
well , joe smith and his angels , they stink to high heaven .
and if you don't care about that , then you can stop caring about who my friends are ,
'cause i decide who my friends are , and who they are not , and i do not need your permission .
as long as you live in this house , and you eat at this table , you need my permission .
then i'll get my things .
joshua , no .
i'll come and help out with the farm , but from now on , i'll be staying in town .
don't do us any favors .
i won't be comin 'for you , pa .
i'll be comin 'for them .
it's alright , ma .
it's alright .
it's alright .
it's time .
it's alright .
let him go .
mr. steed .
won't you come in?
mr. steed .
i finished up the work that i had for you .
i won't be needing you anymore .
you're gonna have to stop beating everyone at stick pull .
afternoon .
are you mrs. gates?
last i checked .
i'm nathan steed .
i heard your niece , lydia , might be staying with you .
maybe .
maybe not .
what's your name again?
nathan steed .
we live north of town .
ah , steed .
i never met one of you 'til yesterday .
now my house is run over with steed boys .
you've seen my brother .
joshua .
here last night .
stayed way too long .
guests and salmon , you know , after four hours they stink .
would lydia know where he is now?
likely .
she's probably in the library .
tie your horse .
you can go in through the back .
thank you .
miss lydia .
your aunt said you were here .
i'm sorry , i should have made more noise .
no .
you play beautifully .
verdinae .
you know verdinae?
the queen's symphony .
you surprised me , nathan .
hello , once again .
i'm looking for joshua .
he told me about what happened with your father .
i'm sorry .
ma's worried about him .
sent me with some things .
i told him he should talk to your father .
he won't .
well , do you know where he's staying?
will murdock's .
you knew he got work at the dock , at a warehouse .
is he there now?
probably .
but he'll be along after work .
just wait .
may l?
of course .
let's go out back .
it's cooler there .
your aunt's garden is beautiful .
it's a very old place .
i used to play here with my cousins .
the flowers match your dress .
thank you .
joshua .
hello , little brother .
ma sent some bread and things .
melissa sent your jacket .
thanks .
i was hoping you'd come .
i told you i would .
how's ma?
worried .
melissa said you can have her warming stone if you decide to come back .
i'm not coming back .
i know .
ma wants you to come for supper sunday .
it'd be good , joshua .
listen , here's some of my wages .
give them to pa to hire some help with .
pa fired joseph and hyrum .
well , good for him .
josh .
it is .
people in town are talking .
joseph and hyrum are good workers .
those wild stories
they aren't wild stories .
my friend's parents heard it straight from joseph's father about him going in the woods and seeing angels .
he never said he saw angels .
it doesn't matter what he said .
stuff you'd hear in an asylum and pa's smart to be rid of them .
tell ma and melissa thank you .
you comin 'sunday?
i don't know .
take care , josh .
i'll leave your things .
thank you .
i wonder what a certain father will say when he finds a dock worker's been calling on his only daughter .
but you kind of like that , don't you?
no .
be honest , child .
i wasn't thinking
sometimes the forbidden fruit seems the sweetest , but you have to ask yourself , will the fruit get sweeter with age or just go bland?
good night , aunt edie .
did you know the brother is your age?
who?
the brother , nathan .
they're different .
he knew about verdinae .
good night , dear .
hello there , missy .
you gonna need some company tonight?
i've seen you walking by here !
lydia !
joshua !
come on !
in here .
i thought you weren't coming .
this is a horrible place .
out there , not in here .
i can't stay long .
what's this?
regressing from man to ape .
that's what the foreman wants around here is apes .
just keep those bales moving onto the barges , you animals .
steward croft is looking for a store clerk .
yeah , at half the pay i'm making here .
but twice the working conditions .
lydia !
in a year , maybe year and a half ,
i'll have enough money to buy my own team and wagon .
is that what you want?
you should move back home .
you could still work here , but it would save you room and board .
four dollars a month is worth it not to have to live under pa's thumb .
it isn't right being separated from your family .
i'm not going back .
let's talk about something else .
i've gotta go , joshua .
i shouldn't be here .
no , no , listen , listen , i'm sorry .
i'm really glad you came .
steed !
it's will and david .
the murdocks?
yeah , they're bringing my supper .
joshua , they can't know i was here .
don't worry , they won't say anything .
no !
is there another way out?
yeah , let me walk you out .
no !
don't tell them i was here .
steed , open up !
nathan !
hello , lydia .
it's been a while .
been helping mr. harris get his corn in .
oh , here , let me .
where would you like it?
over there .
thank you .
i was in town and thought i'd get some candy for the kids .
oh , alright .
uh , four of these .
what else?
five of these .
have you seen joshua?
not often .
he works a lot .
we were hopin 'he'd come for ma's birthday .
i stopped at the warehouse , he wasn't there .
he's with the murdocks a lot , at the tavern .
i left a note at the boarding house , but if you see him , could you give him that message?
what message?
hello , lydia .
spendin 'an awful lot of time in town lately , aren't you?
ma's birthday's sunday .
i know .
she'd like you to come to dinner .
i don't know if i can .
don't know if you can , or don't know if you will?
i said i don't know if i can .
suit yourself .
but i think you owe it to ma .
thanks .
tell your mother happy birthday for me .
good afternoon , mr. steed .
emma smith .
oh .
you're nathan , aren't you?
you're joseph's wife .
last week at the blacksmith's .
i don't expect you to remember me .
oh , i do , though .
how is joseph?
he was just speaking of you the other day .
he was wondering how the crops turned out with your family .
we did well , thanks to him and hyrum .
do you mind if we cross the street?
of course .
hey .
i hate this .
mrs. joe smith .
excuse us , please .
what's your hurry?
where's joe nowadays?
heard he fled the country .
mrs. smith has an appointment .
excuse us .
oh , look at this , luke .
mrs. smith's got herself an escort .
please let us pass .
he even says please .
move .
are you alright?
yes .
nathan helped me .
thank you , nathan .
where you been , joe?
been lookin 'for more treasure down there in pennsylvania?
you got that gold bible yet?
hey , joe , them angels letting you and the missus sleep at night?
the wagon is down by the barn .
make way .
make way for what?
we're coming through , will .
come on , nate .
we just want to ask joe some questions .
ain't nobody gonna get hurt .
get out of the way , will .
now that ain't no way to talk to an old friend ,
mister high and mighty nathan steed .
this a relative of yours , josh?
yeah ... after a manner of speaking .
hello , joshua .
joseph .
so you're a part of this too?
want answers just like everyone else .
no answers today , josh .
emma and i were just leaving .
i asked you that last spring .
you didn't answer me then , either .
so what about this gold bible , joe?
does it even exist?
that's enough .
you've shamed the family enough .
now , what about those plates?
where are they?
them spirits tell you when you're going to get 'em?
you boys should know all about spirits .
all that time you're spending down at phelps tavern .
all you fine christian people !
is this what you teach on sunday?
bigotry !
a decent woman gets accosted on our streets and there's not a man here with the courage to say a thing !
think of that sunday while you're on your knees saying your prayers !
you , too?
i didn't say anything .
yeah , i noticed .
nathan .
what a nice surprise !
please , come in !
no , i can't .
i just wanted to talk to joseph .
mother smith , this is nathan steed who helped us in town today .
joseph , it's nathan steed .
oh , please .
come in and sit down .
we've got pie in the kitchen .
oh , i really can't .
nathan .
emma , fetch father and the children .
mama , who is it?
really , mrs. smith .
i've got to get back .
nathan , give up .
no one refuses mother .
i'm surprised i can walk .
mother's pie is legend .
joseph?
you can ask , nathan .
it's probably none of my affair and if it isn't , just say so .
i think it may be very much your affair .
everyone talks about you seeing angels and having a gold bible .
is there any truth to all this?
do you have gold plates or a gold bible?
no .
can i ask you a question?
have you thought about what i told you before?
yes .
a lot .
i don't know .
part of me wants to believe it .
i mean , i know you're not a liar , joseph .
but part of me says , this is incredible .
god appearing to a 1 4 year old?
i'm sorry .
no , no , don't be .
i feel the same .
sometimes i wonder , why did this happen to me?
i don't know .
i just know that it did .
mother believes you .
she does?
she's prayed about it , for months .
says she just knows .
that means a great deal to me , nathan .
will you tell her that?
now about these gold plates ...
you said there weren't any .
i said i don't have them ... and i don't ... yet .
that's the biggest cartload of nonsense i've ever heard .
there is no need to be insulting , ben .
i just can't believe that a son of mine would , would sit there and listen to talk of angels and buried gold plates without even so much as lifting an eyebrow .
what's the lying fool going to say next?
do you believe this tripe?
i know how you feel , ben .
but think about it .
what if it's true?
the heavens opened again ,
god speaking to his children like in bible times .
ben , what if it is true?
it's not !
the boy's a raving lunatic straight out of an asylum .
pa , we know joseph .
he worked with us all that time .
i don't i don't think he's a liar .
he doesn't have to be lyin '.
have you ever heard of being deceived?
it's the devil's work , mary ann .
and you talk about it , you talk about it out of my presence .
pa !
no !
it's crazy talk .
and god help the fool who listens to it .
is this it?
got to be !
mr. harris said it was the next road up , just across the creek .
it's hard for me to see you in so much pain , dear .
oh , aunt edie !
it looks so forward of me coming to his home .
you're right !
we'll just turn around and go back home .
no one will be the wiser .
on the other hand , if you'll just go on in and get this over with , maybe we can get back to life as we know it .
he should be out here .
he's been working on the fence for hours .
i'd love to watch his face when he sees you .
but i'll be back at the house .
thank you .
you've come because of what happened in town , with joseph and his wife .
did he tell you?
he was so angry with the people .
but you being there ...
i think that bothered him most of all .
i just saw a crowd and came to see what was going on .
i wasn't part of it .
that's what i told him .
how did you know?
i guessed .
i'm so glad you've come to talk to him .
i hope he'll listen .
it'll be fine .
go ahead .
thank you , melissa .
hello , nathan .
well?
well ...
did you talk to him?
we talked .
come on , girl .
the whole story or i'm dropping you off right here .
we had a very nice talk .
how nice?
did you touch his hand?
did he touch yours?
did you take his arm?
was there a hug with the good bye?
none of your business .
so what about the brother?
joshua?
mmm .
what about him?
are you going to make a choice , dear?
or just tear this poor family to shreds by driving both of them out of their minds?
tonight .
for sure .
we've been watching his place .
he has them now , hidden in the woods .
but tonight he's bringing 'em home .
how do you know?
joe's paid a cabinet maker in town to make him a chest .
told gilson it had to be a strong one , with a lock on it .
hyrum smith picked up the chest this morning .
well , then , will , get the boys together .
tonight's the night .
lydia , what are you doing out?
how did you know where i was?
someone at the dock said you were here .
we need to talk , joshua .
we will , later .
waiting for some friends .
we're going out to the smiths '.
what friends?
why?
lydia , joe's getting the gold tonight .
everyone in town has been buzzing about these plates for years .
we're going to be the first ones to see them .
steed !
just ... just wait here .
one hour .
then we can talk .
joshua .
saddle up , steed .
murdock?
just wait inside .
i'll be back .
willard chase has been watching from his place , says joe's fixing to leave any time .
you have guns .
lydia , lydia , nobody's going to get hurt , okay?
the guns are just to make sure joe doesn't get away .
lydia !
you're talking about robbery !
not robbery !
that gold ain't smith's .
it's buried treasure , and it belongs to all of us !
woman getting skittish?
shut up !
lydia , i'm just asking for one hour .
no , joshua .
you're asking for a lot more than that .
he's headed up the hill .
will , you and me are following .
you two head up armington road , hide where it meets stafford .
how are you going to get it down there?
joe's coming back this way .
if we miss him , you've got to get him .
let's go !
stick it right in here .
and just be careful that you don't stick your finger here .
just pull this real tight here .
see this hole here?
yep .
and pull .
pa .
who on earth?
mr. steed , may i speak with you and nathan?
it's very urgent .
he's left the road .
we're going to lose him .
this is it .
he's in those trees .
stay here in case i miss him .
you stupid mule .
i told you to stay here .
we could have had him .
now , come on .
has he got the gold?
oh , yeah .
come on , let's cut him off .
alright , get behind that tree and don't move till i say .
he's going to come right between us .
don't shoot .
you could hit me , too .
get him , will !
alright , let's get this over with .
nathan !
mrs. smith , i am deeply sorry if my son had anything to do with this .
you may rest assured that before the night is through , it will be taken care of .
thank you , mr. steed .
i appreciate your coming .
do you have any idea where joseph is?
we'd like to find him and make sure everything is al
joseph !
mother , can you get some water .
where's father?
he's in the barn .
samuel .
go fetch father .
tell him i was attacked by some men out on armington road .
they may still be there .
then go to hyrum's and get the chest .
attacked?
twice .
joseph , did they get the record?
they tried .
i hid it just outside .
what are you doing here , nathan?
my brother may have been one of those who attacked you .
he and will murdock .
are you sure?
it was dark , but ...
i could tell by his voice .
i'm sure .
i'm sorry .
i don't hold you in any way accountable .
joseph .
pa and i are going up to armington .
it's probably too late .
we're going .
nathan and i will join you .
i'll tell you what , those maston boys , they don't come into town anymore
'cause i beat 'em every stinkin 'time .
well , well .
evening , pa .
nathan .
care for a drink?
it's a cold night out .
i'd like a word outside .
ah , come on , pa .
have a drink , then we'll talk .
i said outside .
now , mr. steed , l
shut your mouth .
pa .
you got something to say , you can say it here .
oh , that's good .
we'll shame the steed family once again in public .
let's wake the town so everybody can come and see what my son here has done .
and just what have i done?
gone after joe smith and his gold plates .
the mcbride girl came for us .
she told us what you and these mongrel dogs were doing .
i told you she was trouble .
shut up .
so was it you that hid in the woods and jumped joe from behind ...
iike a man?
i don't know what you're talking about .
joseph heard your voice call for will .
why don't you be man enough to admit it?
i don't see what the problem is .
he made it home alright .
joshua !
it's plain robbery !
those plates aren't his .
he found them .
ben , we got a problem here?
no problem .
i just came to get my son .
joshua !
no !
don't you ever touch me again !
ever !
get back !
don't !
josh .
hello , martin !
ls that you?
ben , good to see you .
you've been away .
indeed i was .
come on , let's get out of the heat .
heard you were down in pennsylvania .
yeah , i just got back day before yesterday .
business?
yes .
i was helping joseph smith translate ... the sacred record .
it's called the book of mormon .
for six days i wrote and he translated .
how can he translate anything?
he's got so little schooling .
that's the miracle .
so you've seen them .
you've seen the plates?
joseph wishes that he could show them to people , but the angel has forbidden it .
but this has been very , very difficult for him to bear alone .
i can imagine .
i know what you are thinking , ben , and believe me ,
i had my doubts , too .
joseph's a good boy and all , but , i mean , i was getting a lot of pressure from my wife , from other people .
why , they thought i was crazy .
so what i did was i asked joseph if he'd copy down some of the characters from the plates for me .
here , take a look .
who's to say what these are or what they mean?
that's exactly what i thought .
so i took them to new york city .
what?
new york .
went to columbia college .
i found a professor of ancient languages there ,
professor anthon , and he examined them for me , and he told me they were true ancient characters .
i best be getting on , martin .
thank you for the wine .
ben .
you can think what you will , but joseph does have a sacred record , and he is translating it through the power of god .
when it's published i'll get you a copy .
you can see for yourself .
wanted in lndiana for pulling a gun on a lawman , he had fled to missouri , the edge of the frontier .
and in a place almost without law , had become a law unto himself .
raise you five .
you playin 'or what , steed?
hold your horses , friend .
see your five .
and raise you fifteen .
i'm out .
me , too .
so , steed ...
i think you're bluffing .
i'll see your twenty .
raise you twenty more .
must be a powerful hand .
why don't we make things interesting?
i got a freight business , not as big as yours .
two wagons , six ox , eight head of horse flesh .
what are you saying , steed?
my company ... and everything on the table against your stock and wagons .
that greed's going to bring you down .
i'll see you .
i'll raise you my entire outfit .
winner take all .
full house .
queens over 1 0s .
four kings .
drinks on me , boys .
for a moment i thought you were going to close your eyes and offer a prayer of thanks when papa told us to go for a walk ...
with joshua gone , it became easy for nathan and lydia to fall in love .
but we all knew the matter was far from over .
there would be the devil to pay when joshua found out .
can we walk through here?
of course .
my friends think it's spooky , but i love this place , it's peaceful .
and?
very private .
lydia , you know that i love you .
yes .
i want to ask your father's permission to marry you .
he'll say no .
mother's sister runs a girl's school in boston .
they want me to go there and spend a year with her .
a year?
mother says if i accept , she'll not stand in our way when i get back .
you should go .
i'll work while you're gone .
a mr. knight , down by pennsylvania , wants me to hire on .
by next fall we could pay off our land free and clear .
in twelve months you'll change .
i won't .
i can't .
lydia , upstairs , at the end of the hall , room six .
dearest lydia , an item of great concern has come to our attention .
nathan steed has returned to palmyra from colesville a few days ago .
he says he has returned to help his father .
but sources say it is really because joseph smith has returned to the area .
when nathan came in the store yesterday ,
i confronted him and he openly admitted he has been baptized and joined smith and his followers .
stay away from my daughter !
lydia , to this point i have largely stayed out of this decision you have made , but i can be silent no longer .
these events only confirm our deep concerns about your choice of nathan steed , and i must forbid you from pursuing this relationship further .
dinner's not quite ready .
i'm not having dinner , aunt helen .
i'm leaving for home as soon as possible .
joshua !
pa said i had some mail .
is this it?
yes .
when did these come?
they came back together about two weeks ago .
i asked you to mail these months ago , and they just came back?
they came two weeks ago .
you never even mailed them .
i mailed them , joshua , but no one paid the postage when it got there .
liar !
look at the envelopes .
your precious lydia never opened them .
she sent them back without reading them .
i've got to go .
pa's waitin '.
hey !
come spring i'm going to be heading east for awhile .
it's time to see my family .
you mean it's time to see lydia .
i've got to go .
hey !
steed , you're not welcome here .
i'll be taking your daughter out for awhile , mr. mcbride .
you'll be doing nothing of the sort !
she'll be back ... sometime .
he wouldn't let me come see you .
that's why i had to make a good impression .
this has been the longest ten months of my life .
why didn't you say anything about this obsession you have with joseph smith?
i wrote a letter .
after you'd been baptized?
what is this fixation you have with joseph?
does it take priority over everything we've planned?
over us?
this is not about joseph .
joseph's been called of god .
it's god i'm following .
then what comes first , nathan , me or this religion?
do i come first before your parents?
you have no idea how deeply my parents feel about this joseph smith madness .
you continue on this way and i marry you ,
i will be completely rejected by my parents .
i won't be welcome in their home .
my name won't be spoken in their presence again !
you're their only daughter , they wouldn't .
they would !
they would , nathan .
would you ask that of me?
lydia .
i love you !
i want to marry you .
i love you .
don't you know that?
i love you , nathan .
i'm ready to tell my parents if they can't accept you , then they will lose me .
but i will not do that for joseph .
he's a fraud .
i can't believe you've allowed yourself to be deceived .
lydia , l
i'm willing to choose you over my parents , nathan .
are you willing to choose me over joseph?
is that your answer?
lydia ... don't do this .
good bye , nathan .
i was in fayette yesterday .
joseph finished translating the book of mormon .
e. b. grandin in town said he'd print it if joseph can come up with some kind of security .
what kind of security?
three thousand dollars .
i'm going to mortgage my farm .
i'm going in tomorrow with a lawyer and draw up the papers .
that's a lot of money , martin .
oh , i know .
are you certain you want to do this?
don't let joseph talk you into it unless you're sure .
ben , do you feel i'm an honest man?
of course .
i am sure .
do you think he's lying?
martin harris is one of the finest men that i've ever met , and he's no liar .
he's been deluded .
deluded?
i don't know how joseph has done this , but it's evil and i want no part of it .
do you know that martin has mortgaged his farm and that he's given joseph three thousand dollars?
he hasn't given it to joseph .
he's given it to the printers to print the book of mormon .
joseph won't see one penny .
well , three thousand dollars is nonsense .
if you would just come and listen to joseph , even once .
enough !
this has gone far enough here .
you're bringing the children into this , and i'm not having this destroy our family .
what are you saying , ben?
i'm saying there will be no mentioning joseph smith's name in this house again .
not by you or nathan .
and if nathan won't accept that , will you put your fist into his face too?
i can't speak for nathan .
nathan has his own property now .
but so help me , you are my wife , and i will speak for you , and that's the end of it .
bring this man another .
much obliged , steed .
what brings you out this far west , caleb?
well , i hear there's money to be made .
weren't in palmyra .
you you done alright , haven't you?
yeah , i done alright .
how are things back home?
well , same pack of dopes sweating on the docks .
ever see the storekeeper's daughter lydia mcbride?
oh , yeah .
ooh , what a looker !
you mean , you ain't heard?
heard what?
she and your brother?
what about them?
what about them? !
they're engaged to be married .
matthew , is your arithmetic finished?
i'm working on it .
nathan !
hello , beautiful !
hello , son .
morning , ma .
it's done , ma .
what is it , nathan?
book of mormon .
really !
it's finished?
does it have any pictures?
no , no pictures .
matthew , a book doesn't have to have pictures to be wonderful .
where did you get it?
grandin's bookstore .
first copies went on sale yesterday .
went straight there and bought three .
this copy's yours , ma .
i can't .
i bought it for you .
i can't take it , nathan .
ma , it's my gift .
pa can't forbid that .
your father and i have
matthew , we need eggs .
i know .
your father and i had a talk the other night .
he's absolutely against it , nathan .
he's forbidden me to talk about it or to read the book of mormon .
he has no right to do that !
i won't go behind his back , nathan .
i can't keep it .
i can .
melissa .
he hasn't told me that i can't have it .
both of you believe joseph .
i want to read this and find out for myself .
i don't think this is wise .
why is pa this way?
so hard .
that's how he was raised , nathan .
he's no harder on us than he is on himself .
your father's a good man .
i pray every day that the lord will soften his heart .
but even if he doesn't , i'm still married to him .
nathan .
good morning , pa .
i heard you were putting your floor in .
thought you might could use some help .
ma tell you i came over this morning?
no .
did you ask for some help?
no .
i brought her a book of mormon .
i went into town yesterday and bought her one .
don't worry , pa .
she wouldn't take it .
said you had already threatened her .
it's a good thing .
no , pa .
it's not a good thing .
it's wrong .
you'd better watch your mouth , boy .
what right do you have to tell us what we will or won't believe?
you can believe what you like , but you stay away from joseph smith and his devil work .
you and your ma want to go out and join some regular church and thump the bible and say your prayers , that's up to you .
when you start taking on with evil , i draw the line .
so just call it evil .
then bigotry's alright?
you're out of line , boy .
what did grandpa steed give his life for at valley forge?
freedom .
freedom from kings .
freedom to own your own land .
freedom to worship however you choose .
grandpa must be real proud right now .
i came over here to help you .
i don't want your help .
i used to be proud to be a steed .
i thought it meant something .
not anymore .
my dearest lydia ,
i write you with the heaviest of hearts , for i know the distance that separates us .
this little homestead over which i labor once filled me with joy .
now the labor is drudgery .
i can hardly bear the prospect that the light of your smile will never brighten these walls .
what stands between us?
i believe joseph smith is a man called of god to bring about a great work in our time .
you believe he is a fraud , the devil's own servant .
the savior said , " by their fruits ye shall know them .
i enclose the fruit of joseph's labors .
lydia , i ask no more than that .
test the lord .
there is a verse in the bible that expresses the deepest feelings of my heart for you .
please give this to lydia .
if you would truly know how i feel , read the words of john in his second epistle , first chapter , fifth verse .
yours with a love beyond measure , nathan steed .
is miss lydia here?
she's gone to her aunt and won't be back until tonight .
something i can help you with?
for lydia?
could you see that she gets this?
'course .
any message to go with it?
no .
thank you , if you could just get it to her .
that i will .
got all ready?
no , just fetching some fabric .
what did the steed girl want?
steed?
oh , the wagon's leaving .
i'll be back to cook supper .
evening , little brother .
i understand you've been messing around in my personal life .
see , i'm not going to be a dirt farmer
iike you and pa , nathan .
i got plans .
lydia's part of those plans .
lydia doesn't want you .
no , but she will .
no , i won't .
i know how to use this .
the sheriff knows you're here .
he has a warrant out for you .
run , lydia !
josh .
this is insane .
we're brothers .
i don't hold any malice .
i do .
you tell pa supper's ready?
told him twice .
what did he say , matthew?
nothing just kept looking out the barn door .
i asked what he was doing when i went out to feed the chickens .
this afternoon when i asked him if i could go to the village , it was like he didn't even hear me .
set the table , melissa .
ben , what happened at nathan's?
remember , ben , he's still very upset about lydia .
he said he brought you a book of mormon .
i told him i couldn't take it .
he said that .
i'll not be going against your will , ben .
i told you that .
then i'll not be saying any more about it .
if you want my permission to read the book , you have it .
ben?
my feelings of joseph haven't changed .
but i'll not be tellin 'ya what to believe .
ben , joseph is going to start a church a week from tuesday down in fayette .
he's invited nathan , melissa , and me .
melissa , too?
she's not sure she accepts it , and i'll not be pushing her ,
i promise you that .
but i think she'd like to go .
if i were to be baptized?
i'll not tell you what to do .
if that's what you want .
nathan !
hey , matthew !
can you do something important for me?
you need eggs .
no .
can you watch the team while i load ma's stuff in the wagon?
you bet !
hold , mules !
hello , pa .
there's no trace .
we've searched .
i think he's gone back to missouri .
pa .
the other morning , what i said .
i'm sorry .
needed to be said .
fields are drying out .
i thought maybe next week we could work together on the plowing .
whoa !
we're going to have to build a fence around you two just to keep the riffraff off .
thank you , ben .
we'll be home end of the week .
bye , pa .
rest the mules every few miles .
haw !
bye , pa .
bye , pa .
thank you , papa .
i love you .
i love you , papa .
i love you .
can i go , too , melissa?
no nathan , just drive slowly .
i'll catch up .
why do you need to go into town now?
we have to be in fayette before dark , melissa .
it will only take a minute .
i'll catch up .
have you found everything you need?
thank you .
melissa .
don't you look pretty .
thank you .
how are you , lydia?
alright .
how's nathan?
that's why i came .
he doesn't know i'm here .
it's been over a week , lydia .
i know how you feel , but nathan deserves an answer .
an answer?
to what?
if you would truly know how i feel , read the words of john .
now i beseech thee , lady ,
not as though i wrote a new commandment unto thee ,
but that which we had from the beginning , that we love one another .
so you threw out my package?
we'll not have that evil thing in our house , lydia .
nathan sent it to us all wrapped up and hidden so we wouldn't know what it was .
he didn't send it to us , mama , he sent it to me .
did you read the letter , too?
when i saw it was a book of mormon
i threw it in the trash where it belongs .
i want to know , did you read my letter , too , papa?
it's going back in the trash where it belongs .
give me that book !
lydia !
you sent me to boston to learn something .
well , i did .
i saw a different life , where different ideas are respected , examined , not feared .
you are ready to destroy this book without even looking at it .
it's blind intolerance .
that's not what you've taught me .
amen .
brothers and sisters , we are met for the purpose of organizing
the church of jesus christ again upon the earth .
mary ann morgan steed .
having been ...
entreat me not to leave thee , for whither thou goest ,
i will go , and where thou lodgest , i will lodge .
thy people shall be my people ...
and thy god , my god .
this book is not evil .
i want to believe , nathan .
i love you , nathan steed .
oh , yes !
i remember how right , how beautiful everything looked to me that day .
for the first time in months there was hope hope for me when it came my turn , hope for healing in my family , and perhaps , with tolerance , hope for us all .
