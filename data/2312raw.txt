the toccoa men , that's the ones that was there at the very beginning .
they are very close .
they accept people coming in , like myself , as a replacement ... ... but you also had to prove yourself .
most of them were qualified parachutists .
they had to be .
a lot of them were awfully green , and we knew that .
we hoped they could keep alive .
a lot of them didn't .
but after a while , they eventually blend right in .
i think maybe they were trying ... ... to impress the older guys , people like me or shifty .
i don't know why , but i got to where ... ... i didn't wanna be friendly with replacements coming in ... ... because , god , i didn't like seeing them get killed .
it just tore me up .
we were in awe of them .
they were wearing infantry badges .
they had a star on their jump wings .
they were heroes to us .
that's how we saw them .
and they were good .
they were good .
we had good officers , but we had excellent ncos .
they looked after you .
all right , now , lieutenant , nice and easy .
we still got a shot .
tough break .
you're having a tough night .
sorry , george .
it's all right .
nice shot , sir .
thank you , bull .
thank you .
heffron , finish me up .
what does he need?
double seven .
there it is !
you're embarrassing the lieutenant .
drink .
don't mind if i do .
better start winning money , your pals miss you .
yeah , they do look kind of sad .
they're just serious fighting men .
i'll introduce myself .
be careful .
don't take much to set my guys off .
you got some wild eyed killers there .
good thing we weren't gambling .
we'd have gotten killed .
you wanna bet?
a pack of smokes .
i don't know .
come on .
first one to hit the bull's eye?
one shot .
why not?
make it two .
two packs .
yeah , two packs .
all right , two packs .
one shot .
hey , fellas .
what do you hear?
what do you say?
that's babe's seat .
private heffron's .
is that right?
i don't care if it's fucking eisenhower's .
who are you?
private miller .
james miller .
i'm in randleman's squad .
us too .
i'm les hashey .
tony ...
garcia .
i know .
old gonorrhea don't miss nothing .
lieutenant , you gonna shoot lefty all night?
come on .
because he's right handed .
what would i do without george luz?
goodness gracious !
two packs , gentlemen .
pay up .
so heffron tell you about doris yet?
no .
well , then i'm gonna educate you .
we're ready to get on the plane for the first jump .
all of a sudden , heffron stops .
boom .
everybody banging into each other .
heffron's staring at the airplane's nose , because on it ... ... is painted this beautiful pinup .
darling doris .
doris just happens to be the name of the skirt who just that day ... ... sent babe one of them letters .
you know them ...
web , what do you call them letters?
dear john letter .
that's it .
a " dear babe " letter .
anyway , lucky for babe , patton overruns our drop zone .
mission canceled .
babe don't have to risk getting inside doris again .
bull , your squad listens good .
they're being polite , like whenever bull opens his mouth .
they're just humoring him?
yeah , like whenever he gives out some of his folksy farm wisdom .
probably think he's a fucking hayseed .
ain't that right?
what are you laughing at?
you new boys , you pay attention to sergeant randleman .
got that?
that's the smartest man in the company .
where'd you get that?
it's the presidential distinguished unit citation .
for what the regiment did in normandy .
right .
for what the regiment did .
you weren't there .
ease up , cobb .
it's a unit citation .
shit , cobb .
you didn't fight in normandy , neither .
i got hit in the plane before i got a chance to jump .
hey , you all !
listen up !
i got us an announcement to make .
this is carwood lipton .
he's already married , smokey .
this here is carwood lipton , the new easy company first sergeant !
as befitting his position , he says he has to make an announcement .
well , i hate to break the mood here , boys , but we're moving out again .
as you can see ... ... this is called operation market garden .
for airborne divisions , this one's bigger than normandy .
we're dropping deep into occupied holland .
the allied objective is to take this road between eindhoven and arnhem ... ... so the two british armored divisions can move up it .
our job is gonna be to liberate eindhoven ... ... stay there , wait for the tanks .
the entire european advance has been put on hold for this operation .
it's montgomery's plan , we'll be under british command .
the good news is , if this works , these tanks will be heading into germany .
that could end the war and get us home by christmas .
intelligence doesn't expect much opposition .
they think the krauts there are mostly kids and old men .
we should surprise them .
say goodbye to england , i don't think they're gonna call this one off .
what are you doing?
look at cobb , man .
watch and learn , kids .
you wanna live , jump ready to fight .
who let you out of the hospital like that?
they didn't let me out .
i busted out .
i didn't wanna get reassigned .
can you make the jump?
sure i can , lip .
i just can't sit .
welcome back , popeye .
thanks .
popeye went awol just in time to jump .
what's he doing here?
who , sobel?
well , he's the newly appointed regimental s 4 .
supply officer?
yeah , you got it .
he picked me up in aldbourne .
he know you went awol?
he knows .
he said i was lucky .
i could sit out this jump if i wanted .
i didn't want to .
so he says , " hop in .
" hop in "?
yeah , i couldn't believe it .
maybe he'll court martial me later .
let's get you some gear .
hey , mal , over there .
son of a bitch .
malarkey .
sergeant malarkey .
sir .
you thought you'd get away with it?
what do you mean , sir?
that motorcycle is u. s. army property .
that may not mean anything to you , but it does to me .
where'd you find it?
that's him , all right .
who is he , sarge?
he was our first c. o. what happened?
he got promoted .
just tap my leg , sergeant .
lieutenant , you'll be in the doorway .
yeah , i know .
but , look , sergeant ... ... you'll be behind me .
when the green light comes on , just tap me , all right?
the light will be next to you .
do it .
that's an order .
come here .
when you land , the end will hit your knee and break your jaw .
lose your reserve .
you won't need it , we're jumping low .
you're fine .
come on .
i'm sorry , sergeant .
don't be .
grab your rifle , let's go .
where'd you get that from , hoobler?
i think i love holland .
where'd you get these?
that farmhouse over there .
just sitting out in the open .
i don't know ... ... maybe they were expecting us .
boys .
i made it !
i wonder if they hit anything .

yes .
together we can push the remaining germans out of eindhoven .
