senator , we're making our final approach into coruscant .
very good , lieutenant .
we made it .
i guess i was wrong .
there was no danger at all .
cord .
milady , i'm so sorry .
i've failed you , senator .
no .
milady , you're still in danger here .
i shouldn't have come back .
this vote is very important .
you did your duty .
cord did hers .
now , come .
senator amidala , please .
i don't know how much longer i can hold off the vote , my friends .
more and more star systems are joining the separatists .
if they do break away  i will not let this republic ... that has stood for a thousand years be split in two .
my negotiations will not fail .
if they do, you must realize there aren't enough jedi to protect the republic .
we're keepers of the peace , not soldiers .
master yoda .
do you think it will really come to war?
hmm , the dark side clouds everything .
impossible to see the future is .
the loyalist committee has arrived , your honor .
good .
send them in .
we will discuss this matter later .
senator amidala , your tragedy on the landing platform terrible .
seeing you alive brings warm feelings to my heart .
do you have any idea who was behind this attack?
our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners on the moons of naboo .
i think that count dooku was behind it .
he is a political idealist , not a murderer .
you know , milady , count dooku was once a jedi .
he couldn't assassinate anyone .
it's not in his character .
but for certain , senator ... in grave danger you are .
master jedi , may i suggest ... the senator be placed ... under the protection of your graces .
do you really think that's a wise decision under these stressful times?
chancellor , if i may comment , i do not believe
the situation is that serious?
no , but i do , senator .
i realize all too well that additional security ... might be disruptive for you ... but perhaps someone you're familiar with .
an old friend , like master kenobi .
that's possible .
he's just returned from a border dispute on ansion .
do it for me , milady .
please?
the thought of losing you ... is unbearable .
i will have obi wan report to you immediately , milady .
thank you , master windu .
you seem a little on edge .
not at all .
i haven't felt you this tense ... since we fell into that nest of gundarks .
you fell into that nightmare , master ... and i rescued you , remember?
oh ... yes .
you're sweating .
relax .
take a deep breath .
i haven't seen her in ten years , master .
obi?
obi !
mesa so smilen to seein yousa !
good to see you again, jar jar .
senator padm .
mesa palos here !
lookie , lookie , senator .
desa jedi arriven .
it's a great pleasure to see you again , milady .
it has been far too long , master kenobi .
ani?
my goodness , you've grown .
so have you .
grown more beautiful , i mean .
well , f for a senator , i mean .
ani , you'll always be that little boy i knew on tatooine .
our presence here will be invisible , milady , i can assure you .
i'm captain typho of her majesty's security service .
queen jamillia has been informed of your assignment .
i am grateful you are here , master kenobi .
the situation is more dangerous than the senator will admit .
i don't need more security .
i need answers .
i want to know who's trying to kill me .
we are here to protect you , senator , not to start an investigation .
we will fiind out who's trying to kill you , padm .
i promise you .
we will not exceed our mandate ... my young padawan learner .
i meant that in the interest of protecting her , master .
we will not go through this exercise again , anakin ...
and you will pay attention to my lead .
why?
what?
why else do you think we were assigned to her if not to fiind the killer?
protection is a job for local security , not jedi .
it's overkill , master .
investigation is implied in our mandate .
we will do exactly as the council has instructed .
and you will learn your place , young one .
perhaps with merely your presence ... the mystery surrounding this threat will be revealed .
now , if you'll excuse me ...
i will retire .
i know i'll feel better having you here .
i'll have an offiicer stationed on every floor , and i'll be in the control center downstairs .
mesa busten wit happiness seein yousa again , ani .
she hardly even recognized me, jar jar .
i've thought about her every day since we parted , and ... she's forgotten me completely .
shesa happy .
happier den mesa seein her in a longo time .
you're focusing on the negative , anakin .
be mindful of your thoughts .
she was pleased to see us .
now , let's check the security .
i hit the ship , but they used a decoy .
we'll have to try something more subtle this time , zam .
my client is getting impatient .
take these .
be careful .
they're very poisonous .
zam , there can be no mistakes this time .
captain typho has more than enough men downstairs .
no assassin would try that way .
any activity up here?
quiet as a tomb .
i don't like just waiting here for something to happen to her .
what's going on?
ah , she covered the cameras .
i don't think she liked me watching her .
what is she thinking?
she programmed r2 to warn us if there is an intruder .
there are many other ways to kill a senator .
i know , but we also want to catch this assassin , don't we , master?
you're using her as bait .
it was her idea .
don't worry .
no harm will come to her .
i can sense everything going on in that room .
trust me .
it's too risky .
besides , your senses aren't that attuned , my young apprentice .
and yours are?
possibly .
you look tired .
i don't sleep well anymore .
because of your mother?
i don't know why i keep dreaming about her .
dreams pass in time .
i'd much rather dream about padm .
just being around her again is ... intoxicating .
be mindful of your thoughts , anakin .
they betray you .
you've made a commitment to the jedi order , a commitment not easily broken .
and don't forget , she's a politician , and they're not to be trusted .
she's not like the others in the senate , master .
it is my experience that senators ... focus only on pleasing those who fund their campaigns ... and they're in no means scared of forgetting the niceties of democracy ...
in order to get those funds .
not another lecture .
at least not on the economics of politics .
and besides , you're generalizing .
the chancellor doesn't appear to be corrupt .
palpatine is a politician .
i have observed that he is very clever ... in following the passions and the prejudices of the senators .
i think he's a good man .
my
i sense it too .
stay here !
are you all right , milady?
ah !
what the
jedi poo doo !
what took you so long?
oh , you know , master .
i couldn't fiind a speeder that i really liked ...
there he is . with the open cockpit and the right speed capabilities .
if you spent as much time practicing your saber techniques as you do your wit ... you would rival master yoda as a swordsman .
i thought i already did .
only in your mind , my very young apprentice .
pull up , anakin .
pull up !
you know i don't like it when you do that .
sorry , master .
i forgot you don't like flying .
i don't mind flying , but what you're doing is suicide .
anakin !
how many times have i told you ah !
ow , ow , ow , ow , ow ! stay away from power couplings !
that was good !
where are you going?
he went that way .
master , if we keep this chase going any longer ... that creep is gonna end up deep fried ... and , personally , i'd very much like to fiind out who he is and who he's working for .
this is a shortcut .
i think .
well , you've lost him .
i'm deeply sorry , master .
that was some shortcut , anakin .
he went completely the other way .
once again you've proved  if you'll excuse me .
i hate it when he does that .
anakin !
she went into the club , master .
patience .
use the force .
think .
sorry , master .
he went in there to hide , not to run .
yes , master .
next time , try not to lose it .
yes , master .
this weapon is your life .
i try , master .
why do i get the feeling you're going to be the death of me?
don't say that , master .
you're the closest thing i have to a father .
then why don't you listen to me?
i am trying .
can you see him?
i think he is a she ... and i think she is a changeling .
in that case , be extra careful .
go and fiind her .
where are you going , master?
for a drink .
thank you .
you wanna buy some death sticks?
you don't want to sell me death sticks .
i don't want to sell you death sticks .
you want to go home ...
and rethink your life .
i want to go home and rethink my life .
easy . jedi business .
go back to your drinks .
do you know who it was you were trying to kill?
it was a senator from naboo .
and who hired you?
it was just a job .
who hired you?
tell us .
tell us now !
it was a bounty hunter called [ gagging ]
wee shahnit ... sleemo .
toxic dart .
track down this bounty hunter you must , obi wan .
most importantly , fiind out who he's working for .
what about senator amidala?
she will still need protecting .
handle that your padawan will .
anakin , escort the senator back to her home planet of naboo .
she'll be safer there .
and don't use registered transport .
travel as refugees .
as the leader of the opposition , it will be very diffiicult ... to get senator amidala to leave the capital .
until caught this killer is ... our judgment she must respect .
hmm .
anakin , go to the senate ... and ask chancellor palpatine to speak with her about this matter .
i will talk with her .
senator amidala will not refuse an executive order .
i know her well enough to assure you of that .
thank you , your excellency .
and so , they've fiinally given you an assignment .
your patience has paid off .
your guidance more than my patience .
you don't need guidance , anakin .
in time , you will learn to trust your feelings .
then you will be invincible .
you are the most gifted jedi i have ever met .
thank you , your excellency .
i see you becoming the greatest of all the jedi , anakin ... even more powerful than master yoda .
i am concerned for my padawan .
he is not ready to be given this assignment on his own yet .
the council is confiident in its decision , obi wan .
the boy has exceptional skills .
but he still has much to learn , master .
his abilities have made him , well , arrogant .
yes , yes .
a flaw more and more common among jedi .
hmm .
too sure of themselves they are .
even the older , more experienced ones .
remember , obi wan , if the prophecy is true ... your apprentice is the only one who can bring the force back into balance .
i'm taking an extended leave of absence .
it will be your responsibility to take my place in the senate .
representative binks , i know i can count on you .
hmm?
mesa honored to be taking on dissa heavy burden .
mesa accept this with muy , muy humility and , uh
jar jar , i don't wish to hold you up .
i'm sure you have a great deal to do .
of course .
milady .
i do not like this idea of hiding .
don't worry .
now that the council has ordered an investigation ... it won't take master obi wan long to fiind this bounty hunter .
i haven't worked for a year to defeat the military creation act ... to not be here when its fate is decided .
sometimes we must let go of our pride and do what is requested of us .
anakin , you've grown up .
master obi wan manages not to see it .
don't get me wrong .
obi wan is a great mentor .
as wise as master yoda and ... as powerful as master windu .
i am truly thankful to be his apprentice .
in some ways a lot of ways
i'm really ahead of him .
i'm ready for the trials ... but he feels that i'm too unpredictable .
he won't let me move on .
that must be frustrating .
it's worse .
he's overly critical .
he never listens .
he he doesn't understand .
it's not fair !
all mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like .
it's the only way we grow .
i know .
anakin .
don't try to grow up too fast .
but i am grown up .
you said it yourself .
please don't look at me like that .
why not?
it makes me feel uncomfortable .
sorry , milady .
be safe , milady .
thank you , captain .
take good care of dorm .
the threat's on you two now .
he'll be safe with me .
you'll be fiine .
it's not me , milady .
i worry about you .
what if they realize you've left the capital?
well , then my jedi protector will have to prove how good he is .
anakin .
don't do anything without fiirst consulting either myself or the council .
yes , master .
i'll get to the bottom of this plot quickly , milady .
you'll be back here in no time .
i'll be most grateful for your speed , master jedi .
it's time to go .
i know .
anakin , may the force be with you .
may the force be with you , master .
suddenly i'm afraid .
this is my fiirst assignment on my own .
i am too .
don't worry .
we have r2 with us .
i do hope he doesn't try anything foolish .
i'd be more concerned about her doing something than him .
someone to see ya , honey !
jedi , by the looks of him .
obi wan !
hello , dex .
take a seat .
i'll be right with ya .
you wanna cup o 'jawa juice?
oh , yes .
thank you .
hey , old buddy !
ohhh .
so , my friend , what can i do for ya?
you can tell me what this is .
well , whattaya know !
i ain't seen one of these since i was prospectin '... on subterrel , beyond the outer rim .
can you tell me where it came from?
thank you .
this baby belongs to them cloners .
what you got here is a kamino saberdart .
i wonder why it didn't show up in the analysis archives .
it's these funny little cuts on the side that give it away .
those analysis droids only focus on symbols .
huh !
i should think that you jedi would have more respect ... for the difference between knowledge and ... [ laughing ]
wisdom .
well , if droids could think , there'd be none of us here , would there?
kamino .
i'm not familiar with it .
is it in the republic?
no , no .
it's beyond the outer rim .
i'd say about , uh , 12 parsecs ... outside the rishi maze .
should be easy to fiind , even for those droids in your archives .
these , uh , kaminoans keep to themselves .
they're cloners .
damn good ones too .
cloners .
are they friendly?
oh , depends .
depends on what , dex?
on how good your manners are ... and how big your , uh ... pocketbook is .
hmm .
did you call for assistance?
yes , yes , i did .
are you having a problem , master kenobi?
yes , um , i'm looking for a planetary system called kamino .
kamino .
it doesn't show up on the archive charts .
kamino .
it's not a system i'm familiar with .
are you sure you have the right coordinates?
according to my information , it should appear in this quadrant here ... just south of the rishi maze .
i hate to say it , but it looks like the system you're searching for ... doesn't exist .
impossible .
perhaps the archives are incomplete .
if an item does not appear in our records ... it does not exist .
hey , you !
no droids !
get outta here !
thank you , r2 .
must be diffiicult , having sworn your life to the jedi ... not being able to visit the places you like or do the things you like .
or be with the people that i love .
are you allowed to love?
i thought that was forbidden for a jedi .
attachment is forbidden .
possession is forbidden .
compassion , which i would defiine as unconditional love ... is central to a jedi's life .
so you might say that we are encouraged to love .
you've changed so much .
ah , you haven't changed a bit .
you're exactly the way i remember you in my dreams .
reach out .
sense the force around you .
use your feelings you must .
younglings .
younglings !
a visitor we have .
hello , master obi wan .
hello .
i'm sorry to disturb you , master .
what help can i be , obi wan?
hmm?
i'm looking for a planet described to me by an old friend .
i trust him , but the systems don't show on the archive maps .
mmm .
lost a planet master obi wan has .
how embarrassing .
how embarrassing .
hmm?
liam , the shades .
gather round the map reader .
clear your minds ... and fiind obi wan's wayward planet we will .
it ought to be ... here ... but it isn't .
gravity is pulling all the stars in the area towards this spot .
hmm .
gravity's silhouette remains ... but the star and all the planets ... disappeared they have .
how can this be?
hmm?
a thought?
anyone .
master?
because someone erased it from the archive memory .
truly wonderful the mind of a child is .
the padawan is right .
go to the center of gravity's pull ... and fiind your planet you will .
hmm .
the data must have been erased .
but , master yoda , who could empty information from the archives?
that's impossible , isn't it?
dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is .
only a jedi could have erased those fiiles .
but who and why , harder to answer .
meditate on this i will .
hmm .
i wasn't the youngest queen ever elected ... but now that i think back on it , i'm not sure i was old enough .
i'm not sure i was ready .
the people you served thought you did a good job .
i heard they even tried to amend the constitution so you could stay in offiice .
i was relieved when my two terms were up .
but when the queen asked me to serve as senator ...
i couldn't refuse her .
i agree with her .
i think the republic needs you .
i'm glad that you chose to serve .
if the senate votes to create an army ...
i'm sure it's going to push us into a civil war .
it's unthinkable .
there hasn't been a full scale war since the formation of the republic .
do you see any way through negotiations ... to bring the separatists back into the republic?
not if they feel threatened .
my guess is they'll turn to the trade federations or the commerce guilds for help .
it's outrageous , but after four trials in the supreme court ...
nute gunray is still the viceroy of the trade federation .
i fear the senate is powerless to resolve this crisis .
we must keep our faith in the republic .
the day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it .
let's pray that day never comes .
in the meantime , we must consider your own safety .
what is your suggestion , master jedi?
oh , anakin's not a jedi yet .
he's still a padawan learner .
but i was thinking
hold on a minute .
excuse me .
i was thinking i would stay in the lake country .
there are some places up there that are very isolated .
excuse me .
i'm in charge of security here , milady .
and this is my home .
i know it very well .
that is why we're here .
i think it would be wise if you took advantage of my knowledge in this instance .
sorry , milady .
perfect .
it's settled , then .
there it is , r4 , right where it should be .
our missing planet kamino .
master jedi .
the prime minister is expecting you .
i'm expected?
of course .
he is anxious to meet you .
after all these years ... we were beginning to think you weren't coming .
now , please , this way .
may i present lama su ... prime minister of kamino .
and this is master jedi
obi wan kenobi .
i trust you're going to enjoy your stay .
please .
and now to business .
you will be delighted to hear that we are on schedule .
200, 000 units are ready ... with a million more well on the way .
that's good news .
please tell your master sifo dyas ... that his order will be met on time .
i'm sorry .
master
jedi master sifo dyas is still a leading member of the jedi council ... is he not?
master sifo dyas was killed almost ten years ago .
oh , i'm so sorry to hear that .
but i'm sure he would have been proud of the army we've built for him .
the army?
yes .
a clone army , and i must say , one of the fiinest we've ever created .
tell me , prime minister ... when my master fiirst contacted you about the army ... did did he say who it was for?
of course he did .
this army is for the republic .
but you must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself .
that's why i'm here .
we used to come here for school retreat .
we would swim to that island every day .
i love the water .
we used to lie out on the sand and let the sun dry us ... and try to guess the names of the birds singing .
i don't like sand .
it's coarse and rough and irritating ... and it gets everywhere .
not like here .
here , everything is soft ... and smooth .
no .
i shouldn't have done that .
i'm sorry .
very impressive .
i'd hoped you would be pleased .
clones can think creatively .
you will fiind that they are immensely superior to droids .
we take great pride in our combat education and training programs .
this group was created about fiive years ago .
you mentioned growth acceleration .
oh, yes , it's essential .
otherwise , a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow .
now we can do it in half the time .
i see .
they are totally obedient ... taking any order without question .
we modifiied their genetic structure ... to make them less independent than the original host .
and who was the original host?
a bounty hunter called jango fett .
and where is this bounty hunter now?
oh , we keep him here .
apart from his pay , which is considerable ...
fett demanded only one thing : an unaltered clone for himself .
curious , isn't it?
" unaltered "?
pure genetic replication .
no tampering with the structure to make it more docile ... and no growth acceleration .
i should very much like to meet this jango fett .
i would be very happy to arrange it for you .
magnifiicent , aren't they?
i don't know .
sure you do .
you just don't want to tell me .
you gonna use one of your jedi mind tricks on me?
they only work on the weak minded .
all right .
i was 12 .
his name was palo .
we were both in the legislative youth program .
he was a few years older than i.
very cute .
dark , curly hair .
dreamy eyes .
all right , i get the picture .
whatever happened to him?
i went into public service ; he went on to become an artist .
maybe he was the smart one .
you really don't like politicians , do you?
i like two or three ... but i'm not really sure about one of them .
i don't think the system works .
how would you have it work?
we need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problem ... agree what's in the best interest of all the people , and then do it .
that's exactly what we do .
the trouble is that people don't always agree .
well , then they should be made to .
by whom?
who's gonna make them?
you?
i don't know .
someone .
of course not me .
but someone .
someone wise .
sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me .
well , if it works .
you're making fun of me .
no .
i'd be much too frightened to tease a senator .
whoa , whoa !
oh , whoa !
ani !
ani , are you all right?
boba , is your father here?
boba , is your father here?
yep .
may we see him?
sure .
dad , taun we's here .
jango , welcome back .
was your trip productive?
fairly .
this is jedi master obi wan kenobi .
he's come to check on our progress .
your clones are very impressive .
you must be very proud .
i'm just a simple man trying to make my way in the universe .
ever made your way as far into the interior as coruscant?
once or twice .
recently?
possibly .
then you must know master sifo dyas .
uh , boba , rood eht so heeck .
master who?
sifo dyas .
is he not the jedi who hired you for this job?
never heard of him .
really?
i was recruited by a man called tyranus on one of the moons of bogden .
curious .
do you like your army?
i look forward to seeing them in action .
they'll do their job well .
i'll guarantee that .
thank you for your time, jango .
always a pleasure to meet a jedi .
what is it , dad?
pack your things .
we're leaving .
and when i got to them , we went into aggressive negotiations .
thank you .
aggressive negotiations "?
what's that?
uh , well , negotiations with a lightsaber .
oh .
if master obi wan caught me doing this , he'd be very grumpy .
from the moment i met you ... all those years ago ... not a day has gone by when i haven't thought of you .
and now that i'm with you again ...
i'm in agony .
the closer i get to you , the worse it gets .
the thought of not being with you
i can't breathe .
i'm haunted by the kiss that you should never have given me .
my heart is beating ... hoping that that kiss will not become a scar .
you are in my very soul ... tormenting me .
what can i do?
i will do anything that you ask .
if you are suffering as much as i am , please , tell me .
i can't .
we can't .
it's ... just not possible .
anything is possible , padm .
listen to me .
no , you listen .
we live in a real world .
come back to it .
you're studying to become a jedi .
i'm i'm a senator .
if you follow your thoughts through to conclusion ... it'll take us to a place we cannot go ... regardless of the way we feel about each other .
then you do feel something .
i will not let you give up your future for me .
you are asking me to be rational .
that is something i know i cannot do .
believe me , i wish that i could just wish away my feelings ... but i can't .
i will not give in to this .
well , you know , it ... wouldn't have to be that way .
we could keep it a secret .
we'd be living a lie ... one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to .
i couldn't do that .
could you , anakin?
could you live like that?
no .
you're right .
it would destroy us .
tell your council that the fiirst battalions are ready .
and remind them , if they need more troops ... it will take more time to grow them .
i won't forget , and thank you .
thank you .
r4 !
scramble code fiive to coruscant , care of the old folks 'home !
i have successfully made contact with the prime minister of kamino .
they are using a bounty hunter named jango fett to create a clone army .
i have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter ... is the assassin we are looking for .
do you think these cloners are involved in the plot to assassinate senator amidala?
no , master .
there appears to be no motive .
do not assume anything , obi wan .
clear your mind must be ... if you are to discover the real villains behind this plot .
yes , master .
they say master sifo dyas placed an order for a clone army ... at the request of the senate almost ten years ago .
i was under the impression he was killed before that .
did the council ever authorize the creation of a clone army?
no .
whoever placed that order did not have the authorization of the jedi council .
bring him here .
question him we will .
yes , master .
i will report back when i have him .
blind we are if creation of this clone army ... we could not see .
i think it is time we informed the senate ... that our ability to use the force has diminished .
only the dark lord of the sith knows of our weakness .
if informed the senate is ... multiply our adversaries will .
no .
no .
mom , no .
don't .
no .
no .
don't go .
i don't want to disturb you .
your presence is soothing .
you had another nightmare last night .
jedi don't have nightmares .
i heard you .
i saw my mother .
she is suffering , padm .
i saw her as clearly as i see you now .
she is in pain .
i know i'm disobeying my mandate to protect you , senator ... but i have to go .
i have to help her .
i'll go with you .
i'm sorry .
i don't have a choice .
dad , look !
boba , get on board !
oh , not good .
wait right there .
okey okey .
da wanga !
chut chut , watto .
let me help you with that .
what?
what do you want?
wait !
you're a jedi !
whatever it is , i didn't do it .
ai !
i'm looking for shmi skywalker .
ani?
little ani?
nahhh .
you are ani !
it is you !
you sure sprouted , huh?
wee hoo !
a jedi !
