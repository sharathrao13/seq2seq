the movie will begin in five moments " ... the mindless voice announced .
all those unseated will await the next show .
we filed slowly , languidly into the hall .
the auditorium was vast and silent .
as we seated and were darkened , the voice continued .
the program for this evening is not new .
you've seen this entertainment through and through .
you've seen your birth , your life and death .
you might recall all of the rest .
did you have a good world when you died?
enough to base a movie on?
hey , jim , it's your birthday , man .
what do you say we finish this another night?
turn the lights down a little bit more , will you , jay?
hey , man .
how come the doors aren't in on this?
no music .
no doors .
come on , let's roll .
rolling .
is everybody in?
the ceremony is about to begin .
let me tell you about heartache ... and the loss of god .
wandering , wandering in hopeless night .
out here , in the perimeter , there are no stars .
out here , we is stoned , immaculate .
it's beautiful .
look at those big , puffy clouds .
hey , jimmy .
wake up .
look at the clouds .
come on .
wake up .
what's going on?
i don't know .
officer , what happened?
can we help?
no , sir .
we've got everything under control .
just a dream , jimmy .
that's all it is .
it's just a dream
waiting for the medicine .
on your finger .
wait here .
don't go .
i'll be right here .
you got a problem with doors?
waste of time .
i followed you from the beach .
you followed me?
why?
'cause ... you're the one .
maybe you should meet my old man .
what's your name?
mine's jim .
pam .
who the hell was that?
i have no idea .
nietzsche said ...
all great things must first wear terrifying and monstrous masks ... in order to inscribe themselves ... on the hearts of humanity .
listen , children ... to the sound of the nuremberg night .
in a seance ... the shaman leads a sensuous panic .
he acts like a madman .
a professional hysteria .
have you ever seen god?
mandala?
a symmetrical angel .
we got our final vision by clap .
columbus 'groin got filled with green death .
i touched her thigh ...
this film is weak . and death smiled .
hey , morrison .
fuck them , man .
it's great .
it's nonlinear , it's poetry .
it's everything good art stands for .
this world , a monster of energy .
without beginning , without end .
likewise , without increase or income .
disclosing nothing .
this world .
this world is a will to power ... and nothing besides .
pretty pretentious there .
not easy to follow .
a little incoherent .
dancing bears , nazism , masturbation .
what's next?
what do you guys think?
a bore , man .
i hated it .
it was better than a warhol picture !
it was worse !
a guy sleeping for seven hours?
there was no political conscience .
you need your art spoon fed to you .
right on !
hold it down .
let's ask the filmmaker what he thinks .
i quit .
awake .
shake dreams from your hair , my pretty child , my sweet one .
choose the day and choose the sign of your day .
the day's divinity .
first thing i see .
come on out for a walk .
it's a beautiful night .
a vast , radiant beach ... and a cool , jeweled moon .
couples , naked , race down by its quiet side .
and we laugh like soft , mad children ... smug in the woolly , cotton brains of infancy .
every time i try to make love to you you run around with your mouth stuck out
choose , they croon , the ancient ones .
the time has come again .
choose now , they croon , beneath the moon ... beside an ancient lake .
enter again the sweet forest .
enter the hot dream .
come with us .
everything is broken up ... and dances .
i can't believe it's so beautiful .
now i have come again to the land of the fair , strong and the wise .
brothers and sisters o'er the pale forest .
o , children of night ... who among you will run with the hunt?
now , night arrives with her purple legion .
retire now to your tents and dreams .
tomorrow we enter the town of my birth .
i want to be ready .
it's beautiful .
do you like that?
it's beautiful .
i've never read much poetry before .
what's a shaman?
he's a medicine man ... of the indians .
he gets into a peyote trance ... and he gets deeper and deeper , and then he has a vision ... and the whole tribe is healed .
all cultures have a version of it .
greeks had theater and gods .
the indians say the first shaman invented sex .
they called him " the one who makes you crazy .
what turns you on?
i don't know .
experience .
freedom .
love .
now .
you know , the first time i did acid , i saw god .
and i saw a friend of mine who was christ and judas too .
then i realized that ... that was the secret of everything .
we're all one , the universe is one ... and that everything is beautiful .
i feel most alive ... confronting death ... experiencing pain .
i think you're most alive by recognizing beauty .
seeing truth .
does death turn you on?
you love death?
life hurts a lot more .
when you die , the pain's over .
all the poems have wolves in it .
all but one .
the most beautiful one of all .
she dances in a ring of fire ... and throws off the challenge with a shrug .
that's beautiful .
who did you write that for?
i wrote it for you .
try acid , ray .
it's guaranteed .
shit , morrison .
my last trip was a real bummer , man .
i never had a bummer on acid .
i'm trying naturally high now .
whatever works .
making movies at mgm yet?
i got in to see the head of production .
he said , " where's your script?
i said , " i don't need a script .
godard doesn't use a script .
he improvises .
the guy says , " great .
who's godard?
i'm off movies , man .
i went out to the desert .
got lost .
i've been living up on trick's rooftop .
got stuck on a chick .
so what else you doing?
writing songs , poems .
stuff like that .
you're writing songs?
so let me hear one .
i'm shy .
sing it to me .
i can't sing .
you sing better than dylan?
johnny's in the basement
mixing up the medicine i'm on the pavement
thinking about the government
let me hear your words .
all right .
let's swim to the moon
let's climb through the tide
penetrate the evening
that the city sleeps to hide
let's swim out tonight , love
it's our turn to try
park beside the ocean
on our
moonlight drive
those are great fucking lyrics , man .
yeah?
yeah .
you write this?
you got others in here?
a bunch , man .
i got a whole concert in my head .
i can see it all .
what the hell happened to you in the desert , man?
ecstasy and madness .
let's get a band together ... and make a million bucks !
i got tons of songs .
things are about to explode .
i can feel it in the air .
people want to fight or fuck .
love or kill .
vietnam is right out there .
sides are being chosen .
everything's gonna flame .
the planet is screaming for change .
we gotta make the myths .
there ought to be great orgies , man .
when dionysus arrived in greece , he made all the women mad .
leaving their homes and dancing off into the mountains .
there should be great , golden copulations in the streets of l. a.
we should call ourselves dionysus .
i got a name .
doors .
you mean " the doors in your mind "?
the huxley book?
doors of perception .
acid .
that's great .
the quote's from william blake .
when the doors of perception are cleansed ... things will appear as they truly are .
mescaline experiments .
reducing the sugar flow to the brain .
come on !
come on !
you know the day destroys the night
night divides the day
try to run
try to hide
break on through to the other side
what's the matter?
it just doesn't sound right .
i know that , john .
jim , stay in time .
i say we try that bossa nova beat .
i think it's hot .
i think the lyrics are kind of weird .
you write one , man .
we need more songs anyway .
i thought it was pretty good .
let's go outside .
i came up with something .
a minor , then f sharp .
you know that it would be untrue
you know that i would be a liar
if i was to say to you
girl , we couldn't get much higher
come on , baby , light my fire
g , a , d.
pretty good .
pretty neat .
try to set the night on fire
great , robby .
you got nice changes in there .
got anymore lyrics?
i got some .
i call it " light my fire .
if i'm gonna compete with your stuff , it better be about earth , snakes or fire .
i like it .
sounds like the byrds though .
but i like it .
it's good .
a little latin beat'll do it some justice .
maybe put a couple long solos , like coltrane on " my favorite things .
start over , man .
a minor , b minor .
it's jazz .
the time to hesitate is through
some kind of intro .
no time to wallow in the mire
try now , we can only lose
and our love becomes a funeral pyre
come on baby , light my fire
try to set the night on fire
can you give me ...
try now , we can only lose
can you give me five minutes?
i got to figure out some kind of intro .
let's let him work .
you like that?
yeah , i like laguna beach , man .
funeral pyre .
what do you think about when you play?
i don't know .
fish in my fish tank .
how about that acid tonight , man?
not for me .
not me , either .
right here at ray's house .
see what kind of trouble we can get into tonight .
no way .
you always get all the chicks .
i always get the dogs .
hey , i got it !
come on !
i got it !
i got the intro !
hang on a second .
john , count off in four , man .
one , two , three .
is that horny fucker in the black pants here tonight?
no i. d. 's , you can't get in .
yeah , we chased our pleasures here
dug our treasures there
can't you still recall the time we tried
break on through to the other side
turn around , man .
come on , let them in .
i found an island in your arms
a country in your eyes
arms that chain us eyes that lie
break on through to the other side
all right
i'm a big fan !
give it to me !
made the scene
week to week
day to day hour to hour
the gate is straight deep and wide
break on through to the other side
all right
hi , jim .
can i have your autograph?
hi , jim .
can i have your autograph?
i don't know .
where do you want it?
anywhere you want it .
leave it to me .
i can take you all the fucking way .
you blew my mind .
did you like the music?
i loved it .
that's why we're talking .
some of it's on the dark side .
you ought to get some tunes .
herman's hermits stuff .
mrs. brown , you've got a lovely daughter
that shit goes right to the radio .
i need him here to groove on my boyfriend .
what about getting us some real equipment?
i sign you to a five year management contract ...
you with the joint .
put that out , please .
we can smell that upstairs .
i can get you there .
trust me for a while .
what do you say?
we'll have a band meeting on it .
we do everything unanimously or we don't do it .
the musketeers .
i'm touched .
let me tell you something .
loyalty don't pay the bills .
think about it and call me tomorrow .
here's my card .
pay attention .
you could get rich .
are you blind?
how old are you?
twenty one .
get lost , will you?
i'll make this quick and to the point .
if you repeat it , i'll deny it .
drop those guys .
jim's got to start facing the crowd if he's going to be our front man .
he's just getting his confidence .
the guy never does what's rehearsed ...
well , how does it feel?
it feels great , but ...
your looks .
your voice .
that's what's going to sell records .
we'll make a million bucks a year .
call me .
i'm right .
hey , man , let's go .
do yourself a favor .
call larry .
i like a guy who wears his soul on his face .
whisky's next , man .
i can feel it in my bones .
i still think the lyrics are weird .
the days are bright
and filled with pain
enclose me in your gentle rain
the time you ran
was too insane
we'll meet again
the chicks are really digging you tonight , man .
we still got to deepen , man .
we got to go one more step .
turn around and face the crowd .
it'll help present it better .
i got to go to the desert and take that peyote .
is that what you're on?
yeah , man .
it's kicking in !
fucking longhair !
he's fucking crazy .
come on .
i'm not doing acid , man .
it's peyote .
what's a rock and roll band for?
let's plan a murder or start a religion .
more , more , more !
i'm into t. m. , man .
i promised my guru .
i'll try it .
i'm ready .
let's go to the desert .
let's do the peyote .
who's on next?
arthur lee .
he's cool .
i am the lizard king !
i can do anything !
raise your hands if you understand .
let's take a poll .
how many of you know you're alive?
bullshit !
you're plastic soldiers in a miniature dirt war .
come on !
how many of you people know you're alive?
close your eyes .
you see the snake .
see the serpent appear?
his head is ten feet long ... and five feet wide .
he has one red eye and one green eye .
that's all right .
it gets better .
peace .
seven miles long .
deadly .
see it .
all the history of the world ... is on its scales .
all people .
all actions .
we're all just little pictures in the scales .
god , it's big .
it's moving .
devouring consciousness .
digesting power .
monster of energy .
it's a monster .
i'm gonna kiss the snake on the tongue .
kiss the serpent .
but if it senses fear ... it'll eat us instantly .
but if we kiss it without fear ... it'll take us through the garden .
through the gate .
to the other side .
ride the snake ...
'til the end of time .
i think i'm fucked up , man .
i'm not thinking right .
look at your eyes , man .
you're death .
i'm afraid of my father .
i can't be what they want me to be .
maybe you should kill your father .
i'm in pain , man .
i feel the universe functioning perfectly ... but i'm still perfectly locked inside myself .
instead of oneness , i feel isolation .
but you're alive .
feel it .
i'm scared .
it's beautiful .
i'm still scared .
then use us .
use our strength .
come on in here .
that's right .
we're a tribe now .
a tribe of warriors .
i promise you , i'll be with you to the end of time .
nothing will destroy our circle .
ride the snake .
come on .
my wild love went riding
she rode all the day
she rode to the devil
asked him to pay
my wild love went riding
she went to the sea
she went to the devil
all that's left was we
i'm lying .
i am afraid .
don't go away !
come dance with me !
where you going , jimmy?
this is the end
beautiful friend
this is the end
my only friend , the end
of our elaborate plans
the end
of everything that stands
the end
no safety or surprise
the end
i'll never look
into your eyes
again
can you picture what we'll be
so limitless and free
desperately in need
of some stranger's hand
in a desperate land
lost in a roman
wilderness of pain
and all the children
are insane
waiting for the summer rain
there's danger on the edge of town
ride the king's highway , baby
weird scenes inside the gold mine
ride the highway west , baby
ride the snake
to the lake
the ancient lake , baby
the snake is long
seven miles
ride the snake
he's old
and his skin is cold
the west is the best
get here and we'll do the rest
the blue bus
is calling us
driver , where you taking us
the killer awoke before dawn .
he put his boots on .
he took a face ... from the ancient gallery ... and he walked on down the hall .
he went into the room where his sister lived .
then he ... paid a visit to his brother .
then he ...
he walked on down the hall .
and he came to a door .
he looked inside .

we'll never work in this town again .
quite a night .
i'm jac holzman .

they asked if you could say , instead ...
girl , we can't get much better .
can you dig that?
how about ...
girl , you couldn't bite my wire "?
i don't think standards and practices would ...
why don't you have a nice , big smile on your face when you get out there?
there's no point in being sullen .

jim morrison .
the god of rock ... and cock .
not tonight , edie .
thank you , not tonight .
this is the fun part of my job .
this is history in the making .
would you like to see my imitation of a shrimp?
let me put it this way .
andy is more than an artist .
andy warhol is art .
sometimes i think bright people in america must ask themselves ...
does andy imitate life , or does life imitate andy?
jim , this is tom baker .
he's in one of andy's movies , " i , a man .
and this is count " ruspooli .
ruspoli .
he's italian , but he lives in paris .
he's from a very famous family , 700 years old .
hi , jim .
you are great .
i see you at ondine's with hendrix .
so cool .
all right .
don't you like the way he talks?
it's so cool .
what's your trip?
my trip?
i thought it was yours .
i caught your gig at the scene .
i thought it was pretty good .
i liked it a lot .
it was hot .
i like your movies , man .
you got a great penis .
we're gonna split .
why don't you come with us?
we're going to get a bite to eat .
no , you can't leave .
where's your will to be weird?
look , that's jim morrison .
i like the doors .
let's get out of here .
these people are wacky .
come with me .
andy's waiting for you .
no , not now .
let's do this later .
do you remember san francisco?
no , not really .
have another joint .
check it out .
this chick here sings with andy's band , the velvet underground .
she says she can drink you under the table .
hi , i'm nico .
it's so boring tonight .
some of us are going downtown to a new club .
you want to come?
elevate your taste in trolls , man .
vodka?
i'll race you .
your death .
come on , man .
let's go .
all right .
we're gonna go to a club .
i think this girl wants to hang out with you .
don't you want to meet andy warhol?
i could do without the guy .
he's a freak .
come on .
we got a big gig tomorrow .
wait .
i thought we were going to be a rock and roll band .
all right .
the four of us .
come on .
this isn't our scene .
these people are vampires .
come on , let's make the myths .
remember?
let's go .
don't leave .
come on , you guys .
not tonight .
i don't know what'll happen .
it might be death .
it's not death , man .
i'll see you tomorrow .
jimmy , this way .
andy's waiting .
this way .
i'll take you to him .
hey , daddy .
jimmy , please .
come on .
andy's waiting .
come on .
hey , man .
how you doin '?
all right .
how you doin ', man?
great .
pretty good .
pretty neat .
there was this big show in philadelphia .
andy .
there were so many people there ...
this is jim morrison of the world famous doors musical group .
andy warhol , of course .
hi .
wow .
we really like your music .
how you doin ', andy?
oh , great .
and there were so many people at the show ... the paintings were getting crushed ... and they had to take them all down .
really , they were kind of ... great .
just the walls .
you see , andy was the art .
you should do a show with just bare walls .
we'd really like to use you in one of our movies , jim .
you're really such a beauty .
andy says someday everybody will be famous for 15 days .
he'd really be great , wouldn't he?
i mean ...
it's the singer , not the song , right?
it's the astronaut , not the voyage .
somebody gave me this telephone .
i think it was edie , wasn't it?
yeah , it was edie .
and she said that ...
i could talk to god with it ... but i don't have anything to say .
here .
this is for you .
now you can talk to god .
morrison .
come here .
darling , listen , i pay the bills ... so i can use any language that i want .
the guy wants to talk to the bum .
check it out , brother .
what are your songs about , mr. morrison?
love , death , travel , revolt .
we all write the songs .
i'm interested in ... chaos , disorder ... especially activities which seem to have no meaning , like this .
how do you feel about being called " the ultimate barbie doll "?
when you say something like that , it's a shortcut to thinking .
and do you think about the dreadful reviews ... your new poetry book has gotten?
i guess they didn't understand .
did you finance its publication?
have you bothered to read the poetry?
you keep denying that nothing good can come out of l. a.
that's a rather provincial attitude .
do you believe in drugs?
i believe in excess .
is alcohol considered part of the shaman's wisdom?
it's the american way .
every year we spend more money on tobacco and alcohol ... than we do on education .
on behalf of the british press ...
what about the future of the doors?
that's just an excuse for free sex .
how do you spend your money?
i believe in a long , prolonged derangement of the senses ... to attain the unknown .
although i live in the subconscious ... our pale reason hides the infinite from us .
are you , by any chance , in a trance now?
do you hurt?
what?
what hurts you the most?
what do your parents think about what you're doing?
actually , i don't remember being born .
it must have happened during one of my blackouts .
they must have expressed some feeling .
well , to tell you the truth , they're not living anymore ... so i really don't like to talk about that .
could you tell us how they died?
it was a ... horrible car crash ... in new mexico ... in the '50s .
my father ran right into a truckload of navahos .
they were ... all over the highway , bleeding .
their souls , kind of stirring in the breeze ... just leapt into mine .
i'm sorry .
mr. krieger , do you really consider mr. morrison a shaman?
don't worry about it .
it happens to other guys too .
wanna do some coke?
it'll loosen you up .
sure .
the new thing .
wow .
how old is this?
that's 14th century .
witchcraft .
it's a religion , you know .
witchcraft .
witches are the protectors of the seasons ... the goddesses of the grain ... and when crossed ... destroyers .
you ever try drinking blood?
what?
it works , you know .
drink it at the right time of the moon .
they used to dance in the forests naked .
i think that's what offended the puritans ... and led to the burnings .
they were a sexual threat to their male order ...
like the bacchae .
five days a year , for dionysus ... they used to wander the hills of ancient greece .
the first witches .
clans of wild women ...
iooting ... fucking ... eating animals raw ...
iooking for dionysus ... to tear him ... to pieces !
where do you get the blood?
blood is the rose of mysterious union .
symbol of potency .
now you .
i can't cut myself .
don't be such a child .
if i do it , you have to do it .
you do it .
come on , rock god .
fuck me .
fuck me good .
what do you want me to do?
what can i do , baby?
what's the matter?
will you die for me?
what do you want me to do?
maybe i should see a doctor or something .
what do you think?
someone from the freudian philosophy?
it happens to other guys too .
you know , that's the irony .
teenage death girls want my dick , not my words .
it's not so complicated .
it's just sex , you know .
never wake up in a good mood again .
it's the hours and the pressure .
you do everything like it's your last performance .
we weren't built to last .
you never know .
you're setting yourself up , you know .
you're setting yourself up .
you're a poet , not a rock star .
you really know what i am?
you know what poetry is?
you don't belong on ed sullivan .
who am i?
where's the feast they promised us?
where's the new wine?
dying on the vine .
see , i lied to you .
i loved fame .
i do love fame .
why are you doing this to me?
'cause you're here .
and that's gonna help?
i don't have this problem with anybody else .
suck it , honey .
come on .
fuck you .
where you goin '?
huh?
where do you think you're going?
love my girl !
how many guys have you fucked?
and how many dogs have you fucked?
you're the only one who couldn't make it , you asshole !
you are the only limp dick in the lot !
will you die for me?
answer me !
will you die for me?
sure .
i'd die for anybody .
shut up in there !
i'm trying to sleep in here !
will you die for me?
yes !
i don't believe you !
say it !
yes .
yes .
i'm just a clown .
am i a clown?
i need a home ... a place to hide .
i'm sorry .
we're gonna fuck death away .
come on .
let's fuck death away .
come on , baby .
all right .
an ancient lunatic reigns in the trees of the night .
we've got a serious problem here .
the fire marshal won't let this concert go on ... unless you clear the aisles and go back to your seats .
unless you clear these aisles , there is no show .
the sound of the crowd .
i don't even like rock groups .
they're sleazy .
you like that , huh?
like nuremberg .
like that?
we're germans .
beg .
i'm begging .
you wanna fuck me?
don't ever fuckin 'lie to me again .
about what?
why did you say your father was dead?
he is dead .
both of them .
totally .
if he's so dead , who answered the phone when i called?
what?
you didn't really think you were getting away with that , did you?
your father's an admiral in the navy ... who was at the gulf of tonkin when the vietnam war broke out .
wow .
your dad's deputy chief of operations .
just don't ever lie to me again .
what?
you shouldn't have done that .
like it's so hard to trace your school records?
you went to university of florida , albuquerque , new mexico ...
arlington , virginia ...
washington , d. c.
you have a brother and a sister .
seven miles long , " baby .
it's all in " the end .
i'm sorry .
what did he do?
did he love you?
how much?
your mama?
hatred's a very underestimated emotion .
doesn't matter anymore , does it?
do you hear them out there?
are you listening to them?
it's you they want now .
it's not the doors .
it's not your mother or your father's child .
it's you .
they don't want me .
they want my death .
ripped to pieces .
patricia , just hold me .
what you doin 'there?
nothin '.
okay , out .
no one's allowed backstage .
don't you know who this is?
it's cool .
i'm with the band .
let's go .
come on .
cool it , pig .
fuckin 'hippie !
motherfucker !

what's happening?
what the fuck is going on here?
i'm blind !
he's under arrest .
don't shut your eyes , jim !
we gotta get you out .
leave him alone .
he doesn't need more shit in his life .
what do you know what he needs?
fuck !
all right

i want to tell you about something that happened a few minutes ago ... right here in new haven .
this is new haven , isn't it?
new haven , connecticut?
united states of america?
is the west really the best ... or are you just stoned on weed?
come on !
sing " light my fire .
i was with this girl backstage .
we wanted some privacy ... so we went into this shower stall .
we weren't doing anything .
we were just talking .
all of the sudden this ... this little man came in ... with a little blue hat and a little blue suit .
he said , " what you doin 'in there?
i said , " nothing .
and he said ...
well , you'd better get out of there or ...
or what? " i said .
and he started pushin 'me .
so i started pushin 'back !
he didn't like that .
then he reached behind and pulled out a can of mace ... and sprayed it right in my eyes .
fuckin 'blinded me !
why?
all because i was alone in a room with a girl ... doing what he'd like to be doing if he could only get it up without a gun .
all right !
in the united states of america , man !
land of the free , home of the brave !
in god we trust !
say your thing , man .
mr. morrison , you've gone too far .
the show's over .
you've violated state obscenity laws .
you're under arrest !
there you go !
out of the way !
get out of the way !
back !
keep 'em back !
get your hands off me , you slaves .
this isn't happening to me , man .
it's happening to you .
let's just say i was testing the bounds of reality .
that's all .
i was curious .
i always preferred to be hated ...
like erich von stroheim in the movies .
the man you love to hate .
it's meant to be ironic ...
like courage wants to laugh .
essentially , a stupid situation .
i go out on the stage and howl for people .
in me they see exactly what they wanna see .
some say " lizard king , " whatever that means .
or some black clad leather demon ... whatever that means .
but really , i think of myself ... as a sensitive , intelligent human being ... but with the soul of a clown that always forces me to blow it ... at the most crucial moments .
i'm a fake hero .
a joke that god's played on me .
good morning .
good morning .
pour me my breakfast , dolores .
what's the matter with jimbo?
can't handle it , eh?
he's pussy whipped .
hey , jim , eat this , man .
we got one last place to go .
ray's getting married this morning .
remember?
alive , she cried .
can't eat that .
it'll make me sick .
give me a dos equis , will you , dolores .
and a ramos fizz .
what happened to you last night?
you bet me $1, 000 you were gonna walk on the ledge of the 9000 building .
let's go right now .
complaining about going home to your sanctuary .
we were gonna make a movie .
you bet me 1, 000 bucks , man .
give him a double .
a triple .
imagine me and morrison in a movie together .
two powerful , two irish ... two fisted fuckin 'drinkin 'guys in the same movie together .
i'll direct it .
if dennis hopper can do it , i can .
we'll all three direct it .
a real road movie in black and white .
we'll call it zero .
what the fuck?
fuck you , morrison !
get outta here !
fuckin 'jack off !
keep the drink .
it's only another 95, 000 ...
it's only another 95, 000 ... but i could get the best clothes from india , from morocco , jim .
clothes you couldn't get anywhere else .
then we could get the richest people to come ...
miles davis ...
sonny and cher , the stones .
it could be the best boutique on la cienega , jim .
why don't we have a car?
we lost it .
yeah , but ... where's the gravy train?
what's the matter with you?
what are you on?
you said you wouldn't drink today .
no , ma , i ain't drinkin '.
you promised you wouldn't drink anymore .
you're not gonna drink , are you?
no , ma , i ain't .
and you're gonna change those stinky leathers you've worn for three weeks .
i don't know about that .
what are you on?
it's just some low grade acid .
it's not heavy .
oh , jim !
oh , god !
i cooked !
i cooked the duck !
it's okay .
people are coming , you know .
ray and dorothy think that we're flaky enough .
you said we'd wait until after , and now you're gonna peak before me .
no , it's cool .
we'll trip , and then we'll eat our feast .
yeah , sure .
no !
you know , i think it's a good thing about ray and dorothy .
i do .
women are such noble creatures .
they carry on your name with dignity after you die .
are you saying you want to marry me , jim morrison?
i think women have a comic approach to life .
how can they not?
they spend their lives with that big dick seeking entry .
come on , mom .
i want to look inside , like a spy .
i'm a spy
in the house of love
i know the dream
that you're dreamin 'of
i know the word
that you long to hear
i know your deepest
secret fear
i know
everything
i love it when you sing to me .
that's 'cause ...
i'm the poet and you're my muse .
lions in the street , roaming .
lions in the street , roaming .
dogs in heat , rabid , foaming .
a beast , caged in the heart of the city , rotting ... in the summer ground .
he fled the town ...
left the chaos and disorder back there ... u
hey , everybody .
here's the nuptial couple .
what am i gonna do about all these papers?

you're trying too hard .
i'm gonna be your editor now .
i'm gonna organize all this stuff and take out all the " fuck " words .

but don't ever expect that jim's gonna love you or take care of you ... because you're one of a hundred .
you don't know when to stop .

i hope you are cool about this .

i summon you up .
by wood and stone , wind and fire , land and water , i bring you in .
we worship the ancient forces of nature .
the great mother , the triple goddess ... and the horned one , god of the hunt .
death does not part ... only lack of love .
the goddess holds the vow forever .

i'm sitting in that fuckin 'booth for months .
i look out of the glass , i see jim , i hear jim ... but i miss him .
and he's standing right in front of me .
how do you explain that?
don't make me go through this whole shit again ... watching janis dive to the bottom of a bottle of southern comfort .
i won't go through it again .
why are you fucking this up?
i love you , man .
you're my own flesh and blood .
catchy tune .
you sold it to a commercial?
how much?
seventy five thousand .
we couldn't reach you .
we figured ...
what is this shit , ray?
it's not a big deal , man .
the song has already been commercialized .
feliciano's already sold two million copies .
robbie thought it was a good idea .
so did john .
so did i.
robbie?
where were you?
you should've been here .
do you know what you're saying to millions of people?
the doors ... all for one , one for all ... not real .
it's not about money ... or records or success ... or these ... desires that you have .
it's about ... using the music to break through .
wasn't it , ray?
i don't know .
we lost something here , man .
i don't think so , jim .
there's just a bigger picture , that's all .
yeah?
in your fucking face !
jesus fuckin 'christ !
what the fuck is goin 'on , man?
just kidding .
oh , hi , honey .
we were just watching a little tv .
i wanted you to find us , jim .
it meant nothing .
you don't have to torture me .
just let me make it up to you .
i love you .
it's gonna be all right .
you're the one .
really?
you're my girl .
so vulnerable about everything , it makes me sad .
all right , let's keep that money machine rolling .
can you find me
soft asylum
i can't make it
anymore
the man is
at the door
this is the trip , the best part ...
i really like .
yeah , i'm proud to be a part of this number !
successful hills are here to stay
everything must be this way
all our lives we sweat and save
buildin 'for a shallow grave
the soft parade has now begun
cobra on my left
leopard on my right , yeah
come on
and it's getting harder
callin 'on the dogs
when all else fails
we can whip the horses 'eyes
and make them sleep
and cry
i love you .
hate your next door neighbor
but don't forget to say grace and
tell me over and over
and over and over again , my friend
you don't believe
we're on the eve of destruction
a hot night in miami , march '69 .
every space in the auditorium is consumed .
unfortunately , the doors have long since sold out .
they've become an act .
morrison falls off the stage at least every other performance .
the soft parade " album only confirms the plasticity of their approach .
songs like " touch me " and " tell all the people " ... are not the doors we once knew .
so the question is : why am i here?
are funerals entertainment?
he's not going to show .
show time is show time .
this guy's done it to us too many times .
we should go on without him .
bill is with him .
they're an hour away .
he'll get him here , all right?
he fucking better get him here , man .
hey , he'll be here .
i'll tell you one goddamn thing .
there's gonna be a show here tonight if i gotta throw a wig on , man ... and sing them songs myself .
yeah , fuck off .
how's it going?
hey , dude .
yo , jimbo .
clean up your act .
you asshole .
i love you !
hey , listen , paul .
can you get us some heroin?
no .
why not?
some heroin .
i am not gonna participate in anything ... that's gonna help you accomplish your goal , jim .
what's my goal , paul?
your only friend , the end
wrong .
i just want to sing the blues , man .
get fat , do nothin ', go nowhere .
just be .
with that waistline , you ain't got much choice .
what is wrong with being a large mammal?
a big beast , like a tank .
you're king crawling flab .
rock is cock , baby , and your rock is dying .
rock is death , man .
there's no longer belief .
i'll write poetry ... and direct movies .
that's bullshit .
you tested all the limits ... fame , fucking ... money .
what you gonna do when the music's over , man ... when you're too fat and old to go out onstage?
what you gonna do for act three?
puke on heaven's door?
listen , you two bit fucking actor .
you underestimate the audience .
face it , jim .
you're not gonna be remembered .
you think all they want is ... two cars and a house .
but you're wrong .
you know what they want?
no .
tell me .
you really want to know?
yeah , tell me .
what?
something sacred .
that's what they want .
something sacred .
he's two hours late !
where the fuck are the seats?
i took them out .
how are you doin '?
i'd like you to meet my new friend .
you're not playing , huh?
we're gonna sue your fucking ass .
so sue me .
if you ain't playing , see where your equipment is tomorrow .
i'm not going out there until i get some sort of guarantee .
come on , john .
how will you know what could have been?
how will you know unless you break on through?
fucking asshole !
you're pushing death , morrison .
people think we're drug addicts because of you .
are we the beatles now , john?
we took drugs to expand our mind .
not to escape .
get him on the fucking stage !
listen .
have you ever eaten human flesh?
'cause i know this chick in new york , man .
hey , it's cool .
listen , listen .
just one more time , for old times 'sake .
i don't want any .
you'll play like an orgasm .

can you still recall the time we cried
break on through to ...
mr. morrison .
you are charged with lewd behavior on four counts .
simulated masturbation ... public drunkenness ... profanity ... and public exposure .
how do you plead?
the defendant pleads not guilty , your honor .
then trial is set for the week ...
i want to bring to the jury's attention that there's playing now on broadway ... a musical called " hair " where the actors disrobe ... and appear naked on the stage .
objection .
that's irrelevant .
sustained .
your honor , how can you sustain that?
stick to the facts .
this is a major first amendment violation ... by the politicians and the police of miami .
every single witness they've brought here ... has testified to not actually seeing my client's genitals ... except one , who is related to the arresting officer .
i tell you , if you convict on such lack of evidence ...
i assure you that someday , somewhere in the still of the night ... you will wake up screaming .
are you gonna get rid of it?
look .
wouldn't it be better to have a kid with someone who wanted to be its father?
it'd be a fucking genius .
that's what it'd be .
you and me?
the child would be a goddess ... or a god .
it'd be a monster .
no .
look .
i got this trial that's hanging on me .
i can't afford this .
i don't want the responsibility .
you're a coward , just a little boy !
the only way you can't afford it is emotionally !
those vows were forever in the goddess 'sight !
death does not part , only lack of love .
come on , patricia .
i was stoned .
it seemed like a fun thing to do at the time .
fuck you .
i'm gonna have the kid .
well , then it will be your kid .
but if you want the abortion , i'll be there with you .
oh , no , you won't .
yes , i will .
bullshit , morrison !
you know who you are !
what difference does it make , you know?
you never pretended .
i did .
yeah , i don't even like kids , particularly .
i don't want the other fuckin 'thing either .
well .
have you looked in the mirror lately?
look at that stomach .
come on , now .
don't say these things .
james douglas morrison ...
i hereby sentence you ... to six months of hard labor in the dade county jail .
and for public exposure ...
i'm sentencing you to 60 days of the same ... after which you are to serve two years and four months ... of probationary time .
your honor , i have an appellate bond in the sum of $50, 000 here .
i ask that mr. morrison remain free , pending his appeal .
everywhere , jim ...
jacksonville , dallas , even kent state university canceled .
the press for the first time turned against us .
we're fucked .
pamela's called six times .
katherine , patricia .
gayle's pregnant .
you gotta go to the dentist .
look , jim .
go home , get some sleep .
wash your hair .
take a bath too , man .
jesus , this guy really despises you .
we weren't even invited to woodstock .
twenty other bands .
not us .
first hendrix , now janis .
radio stations won't play us .
some big cities .
philly , cinci , chicago , detroit .
we can drag this appeal out for years , keep you out of jail .
the f. b. i. 's behind it .
they had memos on you in phoenix .
they extradited you to miami .
a new image .
slow , quiet .
the beard .
the elder of the tribe .
mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord !
the band you love to hate .
let's win there .
it was fun .
i think i'm having a nervous breakdown .
do you hear me?
climb on the edge , baby .
we're rolling , jim .
jump !
let him dance a little bit .
i want you to come back in here this minute , jim morrison .
i am not gonna kill myself for you .
goddamn it , jim !
your whole life is bullshit !
shut up !
you want me , come out and get me !
oh , no !
jim , where are you ...
pam , get back inside !
i love you .
come out here , honey .
come on , baby .
jim , give her your hand .
she's gonna fall .
once more with feeling .
take two .
i don't want to die .
man , we gotta finish it .
we don't have an ending , ray .
all the poetry has wolves in it .
the most beautiful ...
come on , girl .
i see your hair is burning
the most beautiful one of all ... dances in a ring of fire ... then throws off a challenge with a shrug .
that's my girl .
let's go .
let's leave this place .
just you and me , baby .
we can , you know .
just one more step .
i want to live !
i want to live with you !
all the poetry has wolves in it , pam .
all but one .
the most beautiful one of all .
i hope you go out smiling ...
like a child into the cool remnant of a dream .
the angel man ... has finally claimed this benevolent soul .
ophelia ...
leaves sudden in silk .
glory in dream .
mad , stifled witness .
all right !
hi , dorothy .
oh , you cut your hair .
we're trying to have another baby .
was your hair getting in the way?
where's ray?
i got to catch a plane .
he's upstairs .
where's princess?
out back .
we added a rain effect to " riders , " man .
it's great .
it's the best album since " days , " man .
i must admit it's pretty good ... for four guys who weren't even talking to each other that day .
so you're really gonna live in paris , huh , man?
yeah .
you know , be anonymous , write a book .
observations of an american while on trial in miami .
still got a lot of good songs in you .
still think we got a couple of blues albums in us .
i'm pinned , man .
they got a category for everything we do .
i'm a wanted man .
i'm gonna miss you , man .
i'm gonna miss that feeling of playing music with you , man .
you , john , miss me?
more than you think , asshole .
yeah .
you can always whip the horses 'eyes .
as far as i'm concerned ...
i made music with dionysus .
we had moments onstage that no one will ever fucking know .
you lay off those drugs , robby .
hey , merry christmas .
we'll get together again , you know ... in some strange way .
maybe we'll make a movie together .
black and white .
sabrina , this is for you .
morrison , see you around .
what , no bon voyage?
i'll see you back .
and little princess smiling face ... this one's for you ... from chief mojo rising .
happy birthday , princess .
let me see .
it's you .
forever young .
the strangest life i've ever known .
jim .
you got a plane to catch , man?
yeah .
we're reaching for death on the end of a candle .
we're trying for something that's already found us .
last words .
out .
did you get all that?
yeah .
i got it , jim .
come on .
let's get some tacos .
death .
it's not so bad .
jim?
i love my girl .
jim , is that you?
i knew it was you , jim morrison .
i always know when it's you .
come on , baby .
get out of the tub .
come on .
mama will dry you off .
just stop joking around , you hear me?
just cut it out .
was it all right , jim?
did you enjoy it when it came ... just like you said you would?
they are waiting to take us ... into the severed garden .
you know how pale and wanton thrillful comes death ... in the strange hour ... unannounced , unplanned for ...
like a scary , over friendly guest you've brought to bed .
death makes angels of us all and give us wings ... where we had shoulders smooth as ravens 'claws .
no more money , no more fancy dress .
this other kingdom seems by far the best ... until its other jaw reveals incest ... and loose obedience to a vegetable law .
i will not go .
i prefer a feast of friends to the giant family .
