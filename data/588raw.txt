that says " 1 632 .

yes , it's a year .
it's a map of our coastline .
what's that spanish junk there?
mouth , you said you can translate .
translate .
yeah , translate it .
ye intruders beware .
crushing death and grief . . .
. . . soaked with blood of the trespassing thief .
this map is old news .
everybody went looking for that when our parents were our age .
haven't you heard of him?
what's his name?
the pirate guy .
one eyed willy .
one eyed willy?
one eyed willy !
the most famous pirate in his time .
my dad told me all about him .
dad'll do anything to put you to sleep .
no !
see , one eyed willy stole a treasure once .
and it was full of rubies and emeralds
and diamonds?
and diamonds .
then he loaded it onto his ship . . . . . . and sailed away into the sunset .
until the british king found out about it . . . . . . and sent out his whole armada to go after him .
it took them a couple of weeks to catch up with willy .
then there was a whole big war . . . . . . between the armada and willy's ship , the inferno .
during the firefight , there were . . . . . . guns and cannons bursting here and there .
then willy fled , because he knew he'd get killed if he stayed around .
and then he got into this cave . . . . . . and the british blew up the walls around him .
he got caved in , and he's been there ever since .
forever?
forever .
and ever?
trapped .
wow !
you sound as corny as dad does .
my dad tells the truth .
know what he said?
he said one eyed willy and his bunch were down there for years .
they were digging tunnels and caves .
setting booty traps .
booby traps .
setting booby traps so anybody who tried to get in would die .
then he killed all his men .
why?
why kill all of them?
so they wouldn't get his treasure .
wait a minute .
lf he killed all his men , how did the map get out?
my dad said one of the guys must have gotten out with the map .
i believe you .
i don't believe you at all .
what did you break this time?
hey , you guys , look at this .
ever hear of this guy?
chester copperpot .
look what it says .
chester copperpot , missing while in pursuit of local legend .
reclusive scavenger claims , 'i have the key . . . . . . to one eyed willy . '
wow , do you guys realize what we could do?
nobody ever found nothing .
why would this map be in this attic . . . . . . when it could be in some safe deposit box , right?
right . lf chester copperpot didn't find it , how would we find it?
but what if?
you guys . . . . . . what if this map can lead to one eyed willy's rich stuff?
we wouldn't have to leave the goon docks .

you're sure of yourself .
the foreclosure is a definite .

now i dropped my glasses .
i can't see a thing .
oh , my god .

one day i was walking home with it , and two big guys stopped me
who is that?
oh , stef , that's you .
watch out .
data !
turn it off .
oh , data .
the only problem is the batteries don't last so long .
there's a light up ahead .
maybe we can get out that way .
let's go .
i'm not afraid of the dark .
i like the dark .
i love it .
but i hate nature .
i hate nature !
wait a sec !
hold it !
stop !
i'm just a kid !
what's the problem?
mister , i need a ride .
my friends and i had a run in with disgusting people .
you might've heard of them , the fratellis .
we found their hideout .
could you take me to the sheriff?
i can describe all three of them .
will you
what the hell?
he's only a kid .
can't you handle a kid?
does it work , guys?
yeah !
i can't see .
mouth , your father's a plumber .
what are these pipes?
these look like water pipes , guys .
gas pipes .
drainage .
maybe wait a minute .
shut up for a minute !
these pipes must lead to a building or something .
a foundation .
so maybe if we bang on them hard enough , if we make enough noise . . . .
how are you , duke?
hey , gene , how are you?
great .
reverse pressure !
daddy !
let's  get out of
here !
like now !
go , go , go !
we start with the pudgy little fingers .
then the plump little hands .
then the fleshy arms .
now , tell me where your friends are .
ln the fireplace .
don't lie to me !
honestly .
we found a map over at mikey's dad's place . . . . . . that said there was buried treasure under here .
don't give us none of your bullshit stories , huh?
spill your guts .
tell us everything .
everything?
everything .
everything .
okay , i'll talk .
ln 3rd grade , i cheated on my history exam .
ln 4th grade , i stole my uncle's toupee and glued it on my face . . . . . . when i played moses in my hebrew school play .
ln 5th grade , i knocked my sister down the stairs , and i blamed our dog .
i can't see a thing .
what am i stepping on?
oh , brother .
look , a lantern .
somebody must have been here before us .
maybe they're still here .
i hope not .
look at these cigarettes .
ten minutes ago , troy was looking down my shirt .
who cares?
it's not wrong .
lf i'd been smart , he'd still be looking .
listen to her .
what's wrong with her?
andy , it's okay .
data : ls she all right?
i should've let him look at my body .
don't i have a beautiful body?
you've got a great body .
how many years do i have before i get fat?
before my hair falls out?
before i look like him?
then my mom sent me to a summer camp for fat kids .
then , once during lunch , i got nuts and i pigged out . . . . . . and they kicked me out !
look at him .
don't touch it , guys .
this is one of your tricks , right , one eyed willy?
you must be really hiding something to go through all this trouble .
there's nothing to worry about .
you don't understand !
don't be afraid .
he's dead for sure .
i think he's chester copperpot .
chester who?
who?
don't you remember from the attic?
the news article?
the last guy to look for the rich stuff . . . . . . he went in , but he never came back out .
that was back in 1 935 .
oh , god . lf he didn't make it out and he was an expert , what about us?
how will we get out?
don't worry about it .
calm down .
you sure?
i'm positive .
how will we get out?
we can't be sure it's him .
i know it's him .
i bet his l . d. is in his wallet .
mouth , get his wallet .
lou gehrig?
you get it , mikey !
mikey , get it .
it is chester copperpot .
oh , god .
come on .
you see?
i told you .
we're gonna get killed too .
hey , look at this .
candles .
they're gonna kill us .
we're dead .
where are you going?
i'm setting booty traps .
booby traps .
that's what i said .
i'll set booby traps in case anyone follows us . . . . . . like the fratellis .
we'll hear them coming .
okay , hurry up .
good idea .
where you going?
to set booty traps .
you mean booby traps .
that's what i said .
booby traps !
god , these guys . . . .
look .
it looks like a skeleton of one eyed willy or something .
give me that .
give me this thing .
oh , god !
there's no way out of here .
no , don't , don't , don't , brandon .
hey , guys , now that we've got
look at this .

don't move .
don't move .
you guys , don't move back there !
don't move !
what?
freeze !
run , you guys , run !
holy shit !
man , that was close .
wait , listen .
sounds like somebody's down there .
shut up and listen .
maybe it's a way out .
or the fratellis .
or chunk got the police .
or one of willy's booby traps .
god put that rock there for a purpose .
i'm not so sure you should move it or anything .
hello?
bats !
save me !
they're in my hair .
help !
rabies !
rabies !
rabies !
we're gonna get rabies !
but the worst thing i ever done , i mixed up fake puke at home . . . . . . and i went to this movie theater , hid the puke in my jacket . . . . . . climbed up to the balcony . . . . . . and then i made a noise like this
and then i dumped it over the side . . . . . . on all the people in the audience .
then
then this was horrible .
all the people started getting sick and throwing up on each other .
i never felt so bad in my entire life .
i'm beginning to like him , ma .
hit puree .
no , i'm too young !
no !
i want to play the violin !
not my hand !
do i get the truth?
do i get the truth , or do you get juiced?
what was that noise?
fireplace blew .
the kid's not kidding , ma .
there's a tunnel down there .
watch your hair !
they're going for the hair !
watch your veins , ma !
hey , mikey , if you can hear me , run !
run !
they're coming after you !
data : lf we keep going this far down , we'll reach china .
maybe i can go see my auntie or something .
this could get dangerous , andy .
you might want to hold my hand .
thank you .
oh , wow !
oh , neat !
that's beautiful .
look , a waterfall !
wow !
wow !
it's a giant piggy bank !
we're rich !
we found it !
gold and silver all over !
it's gold , we did it !
hold the lantern .
coins !
rich stuff .
what year was the map made?
i don't know .
probably a couple hundred years before president lincoln .
george washington .
martin sheen .
that's president kennedy , you idiot !
well , same difference !
i mean , he played kennedy once .
that's smart .
i'm glad you're using your brain .
at least i have a brain !
you're so stupid , mouth .
oh , yeah?
yes .
shut up !
wait a minute .
wait a minute .
this isn't gold .
this is a wishing well .
look .
it must be the old moss garden wishing well .
i used to believe when you threw money in , it turned into your wish .
i'll take two of your coins .
that's not fair .
wait , wait , wait , you can't do this .
why?
because these are somebody else's wishes .
they're somebody else's dreams .
yeah , but you know what?
this one , this one right here . . . . . . this was my dream , my wish .
and it didn't come true .
so i'm taking it back .
i'm taking them all back .
come on , one eyed willy , what does this have to do with the map?
ls this another one of your tricks?
maybe we should keep him alive in case he isn't lying .
good idea , jake .
put him in with your brother .
okay , ma .
come on , kid .
you dropped something .
what's that , a cracker jack prize?
shit !
we found it on the map .
it has to do with the treasure .

chance at what , mikey?
getting killed?
look , if we keep going , someone's really gonna get hurt .
maybe dead .
we've got to get the police .
maybe chunk got the police .
maybe chunk is dead .
don't say that .

goonies never say " die " !
i'm not a goonie .
i want to go home .
i forgot .
but still !

the next time you see the sky . . .
