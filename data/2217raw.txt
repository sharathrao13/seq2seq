i'm getting my radar fixed monday .
you live in new york?
i do .
lynn !
there you are !
i didn't see you there .
you are shameless .
that woman was 6 months pregnant .
which is the reason i flirted with her .
it made her day .
it made her feel really good .
so , it was out of compassion , right?
i m working on it .
good .
what about the other woman?
blind .
blind .
blind ... like love .
so what about tonight?
am i going to see you?
should i come to the restaurant?
tonight's not good .
it's ... so busy tonight .
i don't think so .
maybe i'll come by and surprise you .
i don't like surprises actually , no .
come on !
i m looking to see the chilean sea bass .
it's not on the sideboard?
no .
i see no bass .
i m gonna kill that son of a bitch !
fakir !
did you move my fish?
i m talking to you .
did you move my fish?
could it be this one lying here disguised as an artic char?
artic char !
the other son of a bitch , glucksman , who calls himself the fish man .
boss , i m getting pissed .
i validate that emotion .
netto , problem !
yes , boss .

this pot is empty .
this pot is bouillabaisse less .

you got a minute , boss?
yeah .
where'd it go?

how much?
three or four?
four .
you're right .
perfect .
congratulations !
excuse me?
i m here to meet will .
of course .
i know , i got it , i got it .
what happened to lynn?
i believe i baked that cake .
light up the oven .
there's a fresh bowl of batter at the door .
i m an easy going guy , right?
i m good to my staff .
i treat them well .
is that a mistake?
because , an occasion , one of them has stepped over the line and said very ... familiar things about my private life .
if i didn't feel like ...
i was leading these poor women to the slaughter one after the other ...
i could build a shute to keep a count by the front door .
so , warning you has no effect?
no .
it's like a greek tragedy , isn't it?
ok guys , i've got bad news .
i m kicking you out ... so other people may eat .
here are your checks .
the good news is the bar drinks are on me .
tommy?
you got it .
thanks .
lady , what am i gonna do with you?
you're killing me .
us?
come on !
how about i set you up out on the patio?
out on the patio?
before my bartender leaves his wife .
i was divorcing her anyway .
restrain yourself , tommy .
eriko ...
are you too busy?
it's frantic tonight , a madhouse .
can you bear with me 2 minutes?
sure .
alright , i'll be back .

will ... spare me the bullshit .
honey , are you feeling alright?
you look sort of sea foam green .
i m fine .
it s him .
he's how old?
who cares?
lf he's rich as well , you might have a fight on your hands .
i want you all to meet an old chum of mine .
he's irresistible .
he's will keane .
and he owns this overpriced establishment .
overpriced?
i can't believe you'd say ...
where else are you gonna find a beet salad ... for under 35 bucks?
i loved the chilean sea bass .
i'm shannon .
shannon .
thank you .
i m simon .
hi simon .
nice to meet you .
you too .
may i ask whose birthday this is?
the birthday girl happens to be my granddaughter , charlotte .
it s not katie's daughter?
you bet .
she's got katie's eyes , hasn't she?
and talent !
forget about it .
do you know that this kid made from scratch all these crazy hats?
they're great .
then she got serious with mine .
pretty sassy , isn't it?
very elegant .
isn't it divine?
you're not kidding about this?
have i ever lied to you?
no , it's wonderful .
really wonderful work .
do you speak?
thank you .
so , you're katie's daughter .
so that makes you about ...
twenty two and never been kissed .
no , i don't buy that .
happy birthday , charlotte .
thank you .
great to see you again , dolly .
great to see you , will .
go right in there .
there you go .
great seeing you .
bye .
be still my beating heart .
or , is that yours?
i think it's mine .
he's cute but he's a little old for charlotte .
he's simply fabulous .
how do you know him?
from newport .
he's an old friend of your mom's .
thanks , melissa .
good night .
when will keane comps 3 bottles of crystal to an underage girl , i know what'll happen .
she's not underage .
she's 22 .
i know her grandmother .
tell me you're not gonna date her .
the grandmother?
i promise i m never touching that woman .
you know what's wrong with people like you?
too much sex .
it melts the brain .
here we go .
no worry about that around our house .
i m on your side .
i m the good guy .
i m sorry .
i melt at least 3 times a week .
is he lucky i m off the market or what?
they wouldn't even look at him .
you hear?
they wouldn't look at you .
you're going to do this , aren't you?
what is it with you two?
will you give me some credit?
i smile at this girl , she bushes from head to toe .
why would i do this?
knock it off .
you'd kill to be in his place .
okay bitch , i m ready .
not me !
can we start with " good morning "?
my god , i m so sorry .
who is this?
guess .
you?
i guess .
who'd you think it was?
my friend , simon .
he always call me the morning after to ... dish .
do you want to talk to my grandmother?
no , i was calling you .
you were?
i got this little problem .
i thought you could help me out .
i got a benefit coming up .
one of those ... black tie worthy cause , lousy food kind of thing .
and i was wondering ...
i'd like you to make a hat ... for me .
actually , not for me , it's for my date .
i don't wear hats , except to yankee games .
the problem is that i don't know her hat size and i don't want to ask her ... because it's a surprise .
was it that woman you were with last night?
no .
cause she had an abnormally small head .
it might account for the limited conversation .
i could always put in an adjustable band .
that's perfect .
wonderful .
it is risky doing it this way .
you can do it .
life rewards the courageous few .
you can do this .
can you give me a point of inspiration?
like what?
like an image .
this hat is like ...
like the line of a woman's hip .
okay .
when can i have it?
let's say ... two weeks .
great !
i'll give you till thursday , 4 o'clock .
okay .
wow .
one other thing ...
you say " wow " an awful lot .
i know .
you're a grown up now .
when is that going to stop?
soon .
i'll see you thursday .
okay .
bye .
wow .
mikey , how you doing?
i can't complain .
you're early , aren't you?
in this soup , you're better safe than sorry .
will keane?
visitor .
he's going to a fancy party tonight .
he's up on twenty four .
i'll key the elevator for you .
tony , this was not an ace parmesan from froman's ...
tony , this was more like a pepperino from scarsdale ...
i know the difference !
it s a different price .
you're late .
i know .
i m so sorry .
i tried to get a cab and couldn't .
i took the subway and ...
yeah , yeah , it's alright .
what's the point of being young and beautiful if it's not to keep men waiting .
in fact ...
i m disappointed .
i was looking forward to at least another half hour of suspense .
i could leave and come back .
too late .
so , whaddya got?
try it on .
i m soaked .
it s alright .
go ahead .
try it on .
you have to imagine it on your friend .
is it the line of a woman's hip?
is it?
yes .
what a shame .
why?
she stood me up .
who?
my date .
she called an hour ago ; said she had a cold .
it sounded more like the hiccups to me .
so , you mean you're not going to go?
alone?
no , no ...
unless ...
what?
no ... no ...
wait , no ... wait ...
no .
forget it .
no wait , what were you going to say?
i don't know .
i don't know .
you wouldn't want to go , would you?
great .
forget it .
thanks .
thank you very much .
it's just ...
you've got the hiccups !
are you kidding?
i'd go in a heartbeat .
you're fabulous !
yeah?
oh dear ...
it must be me .
must be .
do you think i m too old for you?
no , i collect antiques .
or i aspire to .
we appreciate it .
i would love to go , but i m a disaster .
i think with a little plaster and a little paint , you're as good as new .
do you wanna see the dress?
there's a dress?
if you need me for anything , i'll be in the back .
i m curious .
what made you choose my restaurant for your party?
i had to pick a place for my party .
i read that article about you .
the magazine !
the magazine .
it's so embarrassing .
no .
i liked it .
you don't dance .
you float .
that's from my dad .
i used to stand on his feet .
i was floating !
my mom was a great dancer too .
but , you knew that .
maybe .
we danced a couple of times .
now you're dancing with me .
how weird is that?
she was very special .
i had great parents .
i was lucky .
shall we do this?
here you go !
do you want something to drink?
yes , champagne please .
i'll get you one .
sit at the table and i il be over in a second .
i had to come .
i work at the museum .
what's your excuse?
a date ... sort of .
with will keane , right?
yeah , do you know him?
only by reputation .
i m lisa biloy .
i m charlotte .
nice to meet you .
nice to meet you too .
what's he like?
damn it , i see a huge donor disappearing .
i gotta go .
enjoy yourself .
yes , you too .
here you go .
thank you .
who was that?
lisa somebody .
here's to ...
us !
some people star to fall into recognizable patterns .
the next step is that ... immediately ... you know people ... on sight .
and if it's a woman ... it's a romance , forget it .
it's just ... this majorly chilling effect 'cause you know exactly in the beginning ... what's going to happen in the end .
what i like about you is i find you ... completely unprecedented ... and therefore , utterly unpredictable .
god !
that must be a relief .
what?
to finally deliver that speech to a woman and have it apply to there .
because , coincidentally , i am all those things you just said .
yes .
and so much more .
my yoga teacher calls me a " unique " .
come again?
a unique .
a unique .
he's a very wise man .
are you sure he's not hitting on you?
it s a woman !
you are what she would call a " typical " .
really?
yes !
really .
i can prove it too .
you want me to?
okay , try .
alright ...
come here .
i m serious .
closer .
closer ...
close enough?
yes .
i was hoping gravity would do the rest .
maybe i am " typical " .
we should go .
i can smell the rain .
when did i learn how to do that?
what should we do , will ...
with this moment that we're in?
boy , do you look guilty .
i m thinking .
you hungry?
yep .
didn't anyone ever tell you it was bad manners ... to stare at a girl while she's eating like a pig?
this isn't right .
you ... you are ...
young .
yes , and i am ...
old .
older .
much older .
alright , much older .
the point is ...
look , i could put this off , but i genuinely like you .
i want to be clear from the start , so there's no confusion later on , okay?
what i want to say to you is that ... all i m able to offer you ... is this ... what we have right now .
nothing more .
until it ends .
what i mean is .. we have no future .
i know .
i m sick .
what do you mean?
it s my heart .
nobody even thought i'd last this long .
i could've put off telling you but ...
i genuinely like you .
i wanted to be clear right from the start ... so there was no chance for any confusion later .
she's the perfect woman .
young , beautiful and on her way out .
not funny , john .
i know it's not .
it s sad .
she's so young .
no , i mean you're sad .
even this , as far as it's gone .
you shouldn't be doing this .
why not?
'cause it's out of whack .
it doesn't feel totally out of whack .
it doesn't feel totally out of whack to you because you're looking at her .
i m looking at you and it's fucked .
there ain't a right angle in it .
alright ...
i end it .
i don't know .
make up your mind !
what do you want me to do?
i don't know .
maybe it's a good thing .
maybe it makes a sad girl happy and a desperate guy think .
anyway you look at it , one thing ... treat her nice .
what do you mean , " desperate "?
treat her nice .
well , well ...
well , well ...
she'll be right down .
she's upstairs , gilding the lily , so to speak .
he's here !
i m coming !
now , come on .
do come in .
these are for you , dolly .
thank you very much .
they are " loverly " .
aren't they ... lovely?
care for a " cock i tail "?
yeah , sure .
scotch?
neat , please .
my kind of guy .
sorry about the mess .
my maid died 14 years ago ... and i have found it absolutely impossible to replace her .
what can i say , will?
time is a thief .
one day , you're rich as an arab .
next day , you're lucky if you can afford pistachio nuts .
it s funny .
most of us are young for what?
about a minute and a half?
not katie .
katie will be young forever .
so will the guy she married .
i console myself with that idea sometimes .
who'd have thought what time had in store for her .
i m sorry .
i should have called after the accident .
then , on the other hand ... time is in love with some people .
like you , for instance .
you look exactly the same !
please ...
handsome as ever .
and up to your old tricks ...
looks like to me .
look , dolly ...
leave her alone !
she's sick .
will , she's really sick .
what are you guys talking about?
nothing .
just how much you look like your mom , is all .
yes ...
yes , you do .
are you ready?
yes .
bye dolly .
don't listen to her .
have fun !
you gotta look on the bright side .
lf i wasn't sick ... this would not work .
there is no way that we would be sitting here .
we're totally wrong for each other .
we're totally wrong for each other .
i know .
i could be your father .
i prefer , uncle .
do you think we should break this off?
afraid you might feel something?
well , look at it this way .
we can have it real , which we both know is way better .
and , you wouldn't have to pay full price ... because , in a year or so ...
i'd be just this sob story you could use to bag more chicks .
that is a pathetic characterization .
i don't know .
i don't accept that .
the stench of truth .
o world , i cannot hold thee close enough !
thy winds , they wide grey skies !
thy mists , that roll and rise !
it does feel like rain .
you wanna get a cup of coffee , and go to the west side?
no , no .
you'd abandon the universe ... and me for a cafe late?
no , let's not do it .
let's not do no thoughtless thing .
we can't talk about he fact that you're sick?
i m right here , right now .
let's talk about you .
come on , 49 years ...
48 !
all right , 48 years .
come on , tell me about it .
give it .
share it .
you look at me in a way that i haven't quite earned .
then earn it .
earn it , please .
what do you want me to do?
i m yours .
what is it?
what are you doing?
i m keeping it .
this is my watch .
yep .
when do i get it back?
when you forget that i have it .
mix this up a little bit ...
sorry ...
what?
your mother used to do that .
really?
yep .
that's how we met .
i was a waiter ... at the beach club .
whenever i'd pass with a tray , she's steal the garnish .
what else did she do?
what do you mean?
i don't know .
little things .
she'd eat her ice cream with a fork .
really?
really .
yeah .
she wrote great letters ...
but she couldn't spell .
she was a mcgovern democrat but incredibly snobbish .
she hummed all the time .
and stephen stills was her favorite singer .
who?
never mind .
what else?
considering the time ... she was actually ... pretty straight .
i think she only tried drugs once .
there was a lifeguard who gave her a hash brownie .
she threw it up all over him .
she laughed just like that .
words and poetry is what she loved .
she was a " unique " .
okay , you guys .
how about a toast?
welcome to charlotte .
welcome .
cheers !
thanks , you guys .
you know , call me crazy ... but i could swear your friends like me more ... than they like you .
that's altogether possible .
my friends definitely like me more .
what's your point?
that i m way out front in the love race .
love?
love is not a race .
our love is .
our love?
yes , we're going for it , aren't we?
why not?
alright , i have to tell you something .
what?
i never had a date for the benefit .
really?
yeah .
i was kind of wondering about that .
i made that hat for myself?
yes .
you bought that dress for me?
yeah .
you did all that so you could get a hold of me and muss me up?
yes .
first of all , you have great taste because that dress was amazing .
thank you .
and second , you didn't have to lie .
if you wanted to seduce me , all you had to do was ask .
that's not seducing , that is asking .
besides i don't know why but women seem to love it when you lie to them .
there isn't a lie in the world i'd rather hear than the truth .
there she goes again , stepping out on me and breaking my heart .
even he likes me more .
you're fired .
come on , it's just ...
no !
ouch !
ouch !
i can't believe this !
breathe , breathe .
breathe ... are you alright?
that's not accurate .
neuroblastoma is a soft tissue malignancy , but not a cancer .
most common in children .
very rare in young adults .
in charlotte's case ... the tumor is in her chest cavity .
it s growing rapidly , it's proved resistant to both the radiation ... and the chemotherapy .
what about alternative therapies?
eastern medicine ...?
you don't hum this away .
charlotte is the expert in that area .
eventually , she'll be treated for pain .
i suppose , as a final effort ... surgery could become on option .
but it's risky .
so risky that charlotte has ... signed a directive forbidding it , or any other form ... of heroic intervention .
all right .
do you have any idea ... about time?
a year .
maybe a year , at best .
real charmer , isn't she?
how are you on cambodian money units?
are you okay there?
yes , thank you .
that's incredible .
doesn't it look exactly like something she would have worn?
who?
hope is a thing with feathers that perches in the soul .
woody allen?
emily dickinson !
only the greatest poet ever !
uncultured swine .
we all have our areas .
i m a food guy .
why don't you ask me about food .
why are you the food guy?
what is it about the food?
food ... food is the only ... beautiful thing that truly nourishes .
is that a quote?
that's me .
excuse me?
excuse me?
yes .
the woman who just passed by here and went in the door ...?
yes?
it's not lisa , is it?
yes .
lisa tyler?
yes .
could you ...?
no .
thanks .
hello .
come in .
oh , you look so great .
where are the girls?
they're upstairs .
i m going to run up and say hi .
you're a dog .
oh , man !
there's stuff ... in the kitchen .
you want to give the candy to the trick or treaters ... when they come?
one , two , three , go !
go !
ricky , don't laugh , or you're going to get snot in the water .
snot?
where is this snot in the water?
can i get you a bone or something?
don't bite anything that's not an apple .
guess who?
it's wonder woman .
no .
get your hands out of there .
i got it !
we got the champ !
let me give you a hint .
i was the best thing that ever happened to you .
it couldn't be lynn mchale .
god !
you are really bad !
lynn !
i can't believe it !
where are the kids?
upstairs in their room .
keep bobbing for apples in there .
just one more .
please ...?
but then you're going to have to promise you're going to get in your jammies .
yes .
you promise?
which one?
i know , " butterflies " .
two butterflies ... went out at noon ...
and waltzed above a stream ...
then stepped straight through the firmament ... and rested on a beam .
and then together bore away ... upon a shining ... sea .
though never yet , in any port ... their coming mentioned me ...
in my day , you bobbed for the apple ... may there's a nickel in it but ... you eat the apple !
your little animals , grab the coin and run for the door .
they're off to by crack .
definitely .
where's my little puppy dog?
i think he's upstairs .
there you are .
hi .
we were just up on the roof checking out ...
the kids are sleeping .
john's got this amazing set up there .
lynn , i want you to meet charlotte .
nice to meet you .
nice to meet you .
something tells me you're upset with me .
what is it?
i was just wondering if ... if you had sex with that woman?
with lynn?
ever?
the answer to that is kind of obvious .
she's an old girlfriend .
you knew that .
i meant ... tonight .
on the roof .
you're not serious?
you are serious . no !
no , of course not .
first off , it's ... it's not exactly my style .
second ...
you have a girlfriend .
isn't that for me to say?
as far as lynn goes , why would i do that?
it doesn't make any sense .
i know .
i mean , that's what i was thinking ... we're ... so happy ...
what would be his reason?
i thought , god , if he did do it , then you'd at least look ... guilty .
and you don't .
you look totally relaxed .
you look more relaxed ... than before the party started .
well ... there you go .
but , you're a womanizer .
you were a womanizer .
what is that exactly?
here we go .
that's a guy who has sex with a lot of women and is good at lying about it .
yes .
but in this case i don't have anything to lie about .
nothing happened !
there's something about being sick ... in my heart .
it s like i can feel every beat .
i il know if you're lying .
oh , god !
oh , my god !
can you pull over , please?
don't do this .
charlotte !
charlotte !
why?
look , i never pretended to be ... what i m not .
why? !
why? !
all right , fine , why?
why?
because i felt like it .
because nothing stopped me !
what about love?
why do you have to be so juvenile? !
it was nothing .
it was nothing !
it meant nothing !
if i could be different ...
i would .
what about love?
you know what?
this was all wrong .
this was a mistake , right from the beginning .
you're a kid ...
i m a creep .
you've got better things to do with your last ... with your time ... than spend it with a man like me .
look who's here .
the belle of amherst .
i've seen that face before .
you have?
on several occasions .
all for the same reason .
you said mom and will were just friends .
they were friends .
but she was just nuts about him .
she never slept with him .
maybe because she was an old fashioned girl .
but she was smart .
until she made the big mistake .
she told him how she really felt .
it was up in newport at the club .
labor day weekend .
big clam bake .
well , what happened?
next thing you knew , he was knocking up millie what's her name in a cabana .
millie?
your mother's doubles partner .
why didn't you tell me any of this?
you know , you could have warned me .
i could have .
but i didn't .
you never talk to me .
you never tell me what to do .
charlotte , take a good look at me .
you want me to tell you what to do?
yes !
you're my family !
you're my family .
you're supposed to take care of me .
where you been?
home .
i called you ten times .
i had the ringer off .
i don't get it .
what's to get?
i was hanging out .
something happen at my party?
you were there .
we had a good time .
come on !
what's going on?
nothing !
what is it , something with charlotte?
we called it quits .
you're shittin 'me !
it s not exactly we called it quits , it was a more of , she called it quits .
what did you do?
what do you mean ...?
what did you do?
what did i ...?
don't bullshit me .
what did you do?
i had sex with lynn mchale up on your roof .
you're kidding me .
no , i m not kidding you .
now she's gone .
totally .
i m really sorry you did that .
i blew it .
can you get her back?
i blew it .
so?
so , i just go back to the way i was .
and how are you going to do that?
it was just going to get worse .
the more attachment on both sides , leading to what?
it s now or later , right?
i leave her a few months from now , she ...
no , this is better .
this is much better .
i wish the fuck i'd never met her .
i hate to tell you , but there's only two kinds of love stories .
boy loses girl .
girl loses boy .
that's it .
somebody always gets left behind .
try and avoid that , you'll end up an old man toasting yourself at christmas .
listen to me ...
i don't care ! you're going to die in your own arms !
i don't care !
i want it over with now !
mr. keane .
good night , michael .
you've got a visitor .
she's been waiting almost an hour .
lisa !
sorry to disappoint you .
no ... you surprised me , that's all .
did you get my letter?
what did you do with it , burn it?
i read it .
do you want to come upstairs?
no , thank you .
i m sorry .
i didn't plan this .
i didn't plan to come .
peter , my husband thought it was pointless .
but , as it turns out , i m pregnant ... just a few months .
lisa !
congratulations !
that's great .
thank you .
anyway , that made me want to meet you .
i've been a little sentimental about parenthood lately .
do you consider me your parent?
in a lousy absentee sort of way , yeah .
so , how ... how is millie?
your mother?
she's great .
she's good .
well , she's a nut .
she went to costa rica last summer with some guy .
he owns a charter airline and wears sunglasses indoors .
i think he's a gun runner , but ...
do you really care?
no .
no .
i guess not .
what about you?
how long have you lived in the city?
just a few months .
we moved from austin .
if you hadn't been on that magazine ...
i might not have recognized you .
i only have one photograph and it's ancient .
i have one picture of you , too .
just one .
your mother sent me one ... a long time ago .
you must have been about twelve .
you had a horse .
summer camp .
my teeth are bigger than the horse's .
i hated that picture .
i hate it .
i don't .
you were very beautiful .
and you haven't changed a bit .
i should go .
why?
i really just wanted to meet you .
and maybe ...
i don't know .
what?
tell me .
it s not big deal .
i've always had a fantasy that you were looking for me .
and all you really wanted was to say that you were sorry .
lisa , i am .
hey , can i ...
can i call you?
how did you get in here?
dolly .
would you mind leaving now , please?
i need to talk to you .
i think you've wasted enough of my time .
what i did was ... very wrong .
and stupid .
i have no excuses ...
i did what i did because ...
i was scared .
you were a coward !
can you forgive me?
you betrayed me !
for what?
because you got the shakes?
i was scared .
you don't think i m scared? !
you don't think i m hanging onto my courage by my fingernails !
don't touch me !
get away from me !
get out of here !
just go !
you're not good enough .
i know ...
i know i m not .
i just ...
can you let me love you?
please .
please .
please ...
please let me try again .
i m so tired .
the stars are as soft as flowers and as near .
the hills are webs of shadow ... " " ... slowly spun .
no separate leaf or single blade .
all blend to one .
i love you .
we did it ... that was great .
bye !
bye !
are you jealous?
you think ...?
i am not jealous !
yes you are !
do i look jealous?
i am not jealous .
i m a little jealous .
wait , check me out .
excellent !
go !
go !
go !
judges give it a ten !
a perfect ten !
charlotte !
doctor !
mr. keane ...
tell me .
the repeat mri and cat scan show interval progression .
the tumor's grown .
yes .
considerably .
it s begun to obstruct the outflow from her heart .
i m sorry , i wish there was ...
there's very little we can do .
we may be talking about weeks .
weeks?
i m sorry .
you said she had a year !
no , i said a year at best .
that's not good enough !
you said a year !
i want to have a year !
this is inappropriate .
alright , sorry , sorry .
you said there would be a point when surgery ...
might be an option .
lf charlotte agrees to it .
let's assume that she did .
when would this operation take place?
when it's clear we're losing her .
would you perform it?
i am not a surgeon .
the point is not finding someone who's qualified .
it s finding someone who's qualified who is willing to do the operation .
hey !
hey .
how are you?
you okay?
yes .
how do you feel?
stoned .
you're killing my hand .
charlotte , there's something i would like to talk to you about .
don't .
heavy .
no heavy .
sibley and i have been talking ... about surgery .
about the paper you signed .
no violins .
come on .
i m fine .
woody , you're the head of surgery ... if you can't help me , who can?
are you trying to tell me that in all of mt .
sinai , there is not one single ...
yeah , sibley told me that .
the 30th .
yeah , fine ... blank .
ok , when will the doctor be out of surgery?
this is urgent .
i have a friend who says she's one of the few doc ...
i m sorry .
thank you .
please , i don't ... speak german .
please , i'd like to speak to a doctor .
where's the doctor?
he can't be in surgery for a week and a half .
no !
you do not hang up ! ...
she doesn't have long .
weeks .
maybe less .
and they can't do anything for her?
no , her doctor says when it's hopeless at the end ... ... surgery could be an option .
heroic surgery , she calls it .
that's why i m out looking for someone to make sure that when the times ... comes , it's a hero that performs it .
i haven't found anybody yet though .
i can't find anybody who's even willing to attempt it .
i will !
i m going to find someone because i can't lose her .
it won't happen .
she's too young .
i m sorry .
i m here , but i have no right to be here .
there's no excuse for what i did to you , lisa .
you're my child .
you needed me .
i m so sorry .
i want to help you ... find a surgeon .
i m a researcher .
i can find anyone .
even you .
what do you want for christmas?
you can be really selfish about this ... anything you want .
or we can go somewhere ... anywhere .
i il take you to bali ...
timbuktu ...
buffalo .
don't you have a restaurant to run?
what's more important , is what do you want for christmas?
no , you already gave me my present .
i forgot .
did you like it?
what was it again?
misery , heartbreak , pain ... ... happiness , love ...
life .
i remember now .
what can i give you?
more of this .
yeah?
i've got him .
oh lisa , hold on , hold on .
yeah , go ahead .
his name is tom grandy .
harvard undergrad .
he's at the cleveland heart institute .
ohio? !
it's one of the best in the world .
he did his residency at brigham , cardiac surgery training at cleveland .
he takes the cases no one else will touch .
they say he's a miracle worker .
he spends a lot of time traveling , a lot of time lecturing .
i got you an appointment today at 12 : 30 .
do not be late .
he only has 15 minutes .
the surgeon that recommended him said if you can get him to take the case ... ... you know charlotte's got a chance .
he hates the fail .
mr. keane?
yeah , hi .
thanks for a seeing me .
i've got everything that you asked for .
just once i'd like to get sent something simple .
that never happens anymore .
the downside of being good at my job .
good?
my daughter was told you were the best .
like most people , i do the best can .
last time she passed out she regained consciousness almost immediately .
next time , or the time after , she won't .
when that happens , call me .
room 17 is ready , dr. grandy .
they'll reach me wherever i am .
i il coordinate with sibley .
i can't thank you enough .
thank you .
i haven't done anything yet .
i m home .
hello .

where were you today?
what do you mean?
when you called , i thought you were at work ... then when i called you back , john said you hadn't been in all day .
i was in montclair , new jersey .
why?
an opportunity .
do you mean sexual or professional?
sexual .
i mean , professional !
you get it in there without breaking it , i il give you another 5 bucks .
six dollars ... six of you .
it s way too crowded .
i m way too claustrophobic .
i il take the next one .
you sure?
okay ... bye .
help .
you're going away for the holidays?
i doubt it .
did mr. keane enjoy his trip?
what trip?
just yesterday .
i wouldn't call that a trip .
i've never been to ohio .
it s amazing how little i've seen of this country .
cool ...
i m gonna get me some hot chocolate ...
is it straight?
not straight .
what were you doing in ohio?
i had a meeting with heart specialist .
he's willing to operate .
that's exactly what i didn't want you to do .
you went behind my back .
you lied to me .
this what we talked about ...
cut it out !
stop !
no , we talked about that !
you do not want to die !
you want to live !
you think i haven't been through this?
so many times !
i don't want to give people hope when there isn't any .
why not?
maybe , we need hope .
maybe , i need to know that i've done everything that i could do .
lf i m gonna ...
what would i do , will if you weren't here?
where would i be?
seriously?
you'll never have to worry about that .
i il do whatever i have to do .
i il tear up the papers .
i il tell the doctors .
whatever you want .
cause i really want ...
i don't want to leave you .

time cannot break ... the bird's wing from the bird .
the bird and wing together ... go down , one feather .
no thing that ever flew ... " " ... not the lark , not you ...
can die as others do .
