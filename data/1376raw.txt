howdy , billy .
how are you doing?
okay?
i think these gentlemen have finished for the time being .
if you'd like to put your clothes on .
the officer wants to know if you're afraid .
no , i'm not afraid .
the officer said there's nothing to be afraid of .
co operate , and you'll be on the plane home .
where did you get the hashish?
from a cab driver .
in the playing shop at the bazaar .
would you recognise him again?
i think so .
you decided to fly at a bad time .
guerrillas all over the place , blowing up planes ...
four planes in four days .
don't you read the newspapers?
there's been a shit storm over the flow of heroin from turkey .
i didn't have heroin .
a drug is a drug .
it was my first time .
it was only two kilos .
it doesn't matter if it was 2 or 200 kilos .
catching you shows the world turkey is fighting the drug trade .
are you with the consulate?
something like that .
cigarette?
what did you pay this cab driver? $200 .
my last 200 .
how much did you figure to make?
i'd only sell it to my friends .
i'm not a pusher .
honest .
it beats working .
have you got a family?
mother , father , brother , sister .
long island .
it'll be tough on them .
girlfriend?
yeah , she was on the plane .
she didn't know anything about it .
lucky girl .
she used to say i was lucky .
let's hope so , billy .
you seem like a nice enough kid .
but you try it , and i'll blow your brains out .
mom and dad , this is the hardest letter i've ever had to write .
i hoped to get out of this quickly , so you'd never know about it .
but that just isn't possible now .
i don't know what's going to happen .
what can i say to you?
will " i'm sorry " make a difference?
will it ease the pain , the shame you must be feeling?
forgive me , please .
could i have a blanket?
it's cold .
could i have a blanket?
a blanket !
too late .
tomorrow .
he'll be here tomorrow , i think .
goodnight .
can you speak english?
your cell is open .
blankets , three cells down .
you get me one .
i needed a blanket .
william hayes .
i needed a blanket , i was cold !
jesus ...
come on , you must stand .
you'd better walk around , or your feet will swell up .
you've got to be crazy .
we all are .
smoke some of this .
you've been out for days , talking all kinds of shit .
how does it feel?
about as good as it looks .
gecmis olsun .
it's turkish .
it means , " may it pass quickly .
it looks like a cheap hotel .
the room service is lousy .
i'm jimmy booth .
this is erich ... something swedish .
just erich .
he cleaned you up .
thanks .
i'm billy hayes ... at least i used to be .
why peacocks?
they use them instead of dogs .
they scream like mad if they're disturbed and they don't get rabies .
who are the kids?
little fuckers ...
thieves , rapists , murderers ...
you name it , they do it .
don't trust any of them .
they tell rifki everything .
he's the squeal around here .
he sells tea ,
hash , blankets , anything for a buck .
what are you in for , hash?
yeah .
where?
at the airport .
that's heavy .
this ain't the good old usa .
in turkey , it's a fucking accident if you're innocent .
nobody here is innocent .
don't pay too much attention .
anything is possible in turkey .
they may not hit you for smuggling .
if they make it possession , you might even get bail .
if you make bail , you're free .
sneak across the border to greece .
sure , keep dreaming .
see where it gets you .
like max .
it's going to be a while before you taste a hamburger again .
you broke the law .
the law is sometimes wrong .
the law is never wrong !
the fucking law is .
people get on his nerves .
what's he in for?
stealing from a mosque .
what did he steal?
two candlesticks .
that's all?
jimmy has more balls than brains .
he was in for a year and a half before he even told his parents .
what about you?
hashish , like most foreigners .
what did they give you?
12 years .
i had 100 grams .
you've got to get a good lawyer .
talk to the englishman .
max .
he's been in the longest .
seven years .
gastro .
stomach medicine .
it's got codeine in it .
it's the best i can do around here .
max ...
lawyers ...?
oh , yeah .
there's no straight lawyers in turkey .
they're all bent .
bent as hairpins .
occupational necessity .
they have special classes in corruption at night school .
if you're suspected of honesty , you're disbarred .
i knew a lawyer fellow once .
he got that frenchman off .
la roche .
a big smuggler .
200 kilos .
he put enough bread in enough pockets .
got bail .
vanished .
his name?
who?
the lawyer .
lawyer?
who got the frenchman off .
yesil is his name .
i don't know anything else about him .
yesil .
the best thing to do is get your ass out of here .
yeah , but how?
catch the midnight express .
what's that?
it's not a train .
it's a prison word for ... escape .
it doesn't stop around here .
dad , i'm sorry .
forget it .
i'll punch you in the nose later .
we've got to get you out of here .
this is a suit i brought for you .
smarten you up a little .
are you all right?
yeah .
how's mom?
well , she's bad .
she couldn't make the trip .
you know mom .
her boy ...
susan told us before we got your letter .
she's saving to come back here ...
don't let her come .
how's rob?
how's peg?
they're the same .
you know .
we told the neighbours you were in hospital in europe .
this is stanley daniels .
he's the american consul here .
billy , we're going to do everything in our power to get you out of here .
that's necdit yesil , the lawyer you asked for .
i know exactly what you feel , but you must not worry .
we'll get the right court and the right judge .
i'll arrange everything , just right .
i understand that if you get bail , it's easy to get across the border .
that's what we're shooting for .
i've spoken to the state department .
right now , relations with the turks aren't too good .
nixon upset them .
our best bet is right here .
dad , i'll pay you back for this .
money doesn't matter , billy .
not at this stage .
where did you get that limp?
i twisted my ankle .
where are you staying?
the hilton .
how do you like istanbul?
interesting place .
the food is lousy .
the crap they sell in the restaurants ...
i had to run to the toilet .
you should have seen the toilet .
i'll eat at the hilton every night .
steak , french fries and ketchup .
billy ...
why did you do it?
money .
i know you kids smoke that stuff and we drink booze ,
but taking it across the border , that's stupid .
i know .
dad ... get me out of here .
i promise you .
just sit tight .
let me work with mr. daniels and mr. yesil here .
we'll get you out , okay?
hey , billy ...
okay?
okay .
what did that prosecutor say?
it's not important .
we made our case .
you spoke well .
the judge liked you .
mr. hayes , the judge is coming back .
four years , two months .
four years?
we'll appeal .
it'll be reduced for good behaviour .
it is only for possession .
the prosecutor wanted a life sentence for smuggling .
to be honest , mr. hayes , it is a great victory .
with good time , it works out to about three years .
and then there's the appeal .
daniels and yesil are all working for you .
we're trying to get you transferred .
daniels thinks there might be a political amnesty any month now .
all right , billy ...
i know it sounds tough , but we are going to get you out .
i promise you .
don't do anything stupid .
they could play with your sentence .
all right , now ...
i'm putting $500 in the bank .
anything you need , you write .
there's food here , candy , writing paper ,
books , cigarettes , soap , toothbrush ...
i've sold insurance for 30 years .
now i've got to see my own son ...
jesus !
if i could be where you are ...
i'd be there .
i love you , dad .
you take good care of my boy , or i'll have your fucking head !
dear susan , 1970 has now passed into 1971 .
you can drift in here and never know you're gone .
you can fade so far out , you don't know where you are anymore .
i find loneliness is a physical pain that hurts all over .
to the turks everything is " soyle boyle " .
it means " iike this , like that .
you never know what will happen .
all foreigners are " ayip .
they're considered dirty .
so is homosexuality , but they do it every chance they get .
there are about 1, 000 things that are " ayip " .
you can stab or shoot somebody below the waist but not above .
stabbing somebody in the ass is considered turkish revenge .
i know it must sound crazy to you , but this place is crazy .
one day , one of the new kids was raped .
so they picked out four of the worst kids .
then there's rifki .
the more i know of him , the more i hate him . $10 for this shit?
you pig .
there are no pigs in turkey .
this shit is shit .
no , it's good .
good shit .
you big shit .
yeah , me big shit .
you asshole .
what is it with you?
just what the hell is it , man?
you don't fuck with me , i don't fuck with you .
you fuck with me all the time .
you make crummy tea .
you rip us off on the hash .
i make special tea for you .
we have to live like brothers .
we have to be in here together .
for all the money you've got , you've got nothing .
you are american , you don't know .
know what?
dog eat dog .
you fuck other man before he fucks you .
and you must fuck last .
come on down .
egbert ...
sodding cat .
william !
are you all right?
the new american ambassador is following your case .
he says there is progress .
you want a cigarette?
but there is another route ... ... that is quite possible .
for a proper amount of money , it is possible
to convince the ten officials to lose track of your papers
before the high court in ankara confirms your sentence .
and you could be in greece by the time they discover the mistake .
but i have to act before the official sentence is handed down .
and for that i must pay certain officials .
what's that?
the blueprints to the prison , man .
there was this german architect in the hospital .
he let me copy them .
it's too bad you didn't have a xerox machine .
there are two ways out of here .
one is over the roof , but that's kind of risky .
the other way , i'll need your help , and that is under .
a tunnel?
are you serious?
this is not stalag 17 .
that's where you're wrong .
the tunnel is already built .
there's a basement where they used to keep weapons .
beneath that are the catacombs the christians built to bury their dead .
we're sitting right on top of it ... here .
the kraut says that there's a bunch of hollow shafts .
they're like dumbwaiters , all along these walls .
one of them is right next to our shower .
if we get in there , we can get down into the catacombs .
with three of us working , it shouldn't take too long .
i swear i heard a couple of dead christians singing down there .
you stop shitting me , man .
okay?
how do we get into the shaft?
we knock three times and say we're a friend of the deceased .
i'm getting this together and i don't need no gastro head along .
you understand me?
we go through the wall .
we go through the wall?
go through the wall .
there's no reinforced steel in those shower walls .
it's real soft from underground seepage .
you can almost push it over .
all we have to do ...
we only have to use your screwdriver to scrape the mortar out .
we pull out three stones and squeeze through ...
squeeze through , and get our ass down the shaft .
it's a two night operation .
what do we do in the catacombs?
what do you want , a door?
there's miles of them down there .
you must be fucking crazy .
they've got to come up someplace .
you won't find any catacombs , you'll just finish up in section 13 .
billy ... the tunnel or the roof?
forget the wall .
rifki's always there .
the roof is guarded .
help me get into the shaft .
if we get caught , i'll get the shaft .
i'll be back up to three years again , maybe more .
fuck it , then .
you choose your own death .
i'll do this thing on my own .
i'm taking the roof out of here .
no !
i can't take it !
dear susan , jimmy was caught and beaten badly .
he got a severe hernia and lost a testicle .
he's been in the sanatorium for months .
in comparison , my problems seem small .
but 2 years have gone by .
the turks are slowly draining my life away .
why do you keep your hair short?
to remind me that i hate it here .
prison , monastery , cloister , cave .
prison ...
okay .
i've thought of another way .
another way what?
out of here .
when i was in the sanatorium , there was only one guard on duty .
i could have got out of there .
why didn't you?
as soon as i could walk , they threw me back in here .
lucky you .
i tell you , billy ...
another ward in the sanatorium had no guard on it at all .
who was in it?
three guys .
what was wrong with them?
i don't know .
i think they were dead .
it figures .
i've got to go .
it's daniels !
turkish justice has done it again .
they're going to let me off .
jimmy , i'm going home !
god !
i've got to go .
what's wrong?
sit down , billy .
i'm afraid i have some bad news for you .
is it dad?
mom?
no .
you're going to have a new court .
what do you mean?
the prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession .
he wanted a smuggling conviction .
the ankara court reviewed it .
it seems everyone wanted an example made .
a scapegoat .
we've been notified that they rejected the sentence .
there were 35 judges in the court .
28 voted for ... a life sentence .
the lower court in istanbul had to go along with the decision .
the judge likes you .
he notified your dad .
what do you mean , life?
life for what?
billy !
i have 53 days left !
so now it's time for me to speak .
what is there for me to say?
when i finish , you'll sentence me for my crime .
what is a crime?
what is a punishment?
it seems to vary from time to time and place to place .
what's legal today is suddenly illegal tomorrow .
what's illegal is suddenly legal because everybody's doing it .
you can't put everybody in jail .
i'm not saying this is right or wrong .
i'm just saying that's the way it is .
i've spent 3 years of my life in your prison .
i think i've paid for my error .
if it's your decision today to sentence me to more years ...
my lawyer ... that's a good one .
he says , " be cool , billy .
be good .
i'll get you a pardon , an amnesty , an appeal .
this has been going on now for 3 years .
i've been playing it cool .
i've been good .
now i'm damn tired of being good .
you said i had 53 days left .
you hung 53 days in my face , and then you took them away .
and you !
i wish you could be standing where i'm standing right now .
then you would know something that you don't know .
mercy !
you would know that a just society is based on the concept of mercy .
its sense of fair play and justice .
but i guess that's like asking a bear to shit in a toilet .
for a nation of pigs , it sure is funny you don't eat them .
jesus christ forgave the bastards , but i can't .
i hate .
i hate you .
i hate your nation and i hate your people .
i fuck your sons and daughters because they're pigs .
you're a pig .
you're all pigs .
my hands are tied by ankara .
i must sentence you , william hayes , to be imprisoned
for a term no less than 30 years .
may it pass quickly .
got the old istanbul blues
istanbul blues they give me 30 years ain't got nothing left to lose ...
we are going to get you out .
i promise you .
don't do anything stupid .
they could play with your sentence .
i was busted at the border ...
the best thing to do is get your ass out of here .
the best way you can .
hey , i think i found it .
come here .
listen to that .
do you hear anything?
i told you , you suckers .
you didn't believe me .
keep it down .
look how soft this is .
it'll be easy .
go and get rifki's poker , but don't wake him up .
it's really soft .
it's coming .
jimmy , it's coming .
here , use this .
it's coming real easy .
it's coming right out .
it's easier than i thought .
it's a piece of cake .
it's coming .
like butter .
hey , max .
rifki .
keep checking for rifki .
it's okay .
watch it .
i thought you wanted out of here .
they're loose .
let's try .
watch your hernia .
fuck that .
okay?
you got it?
yeah .
that's it .
it's the shaft .
it's coming .
it's okay .
let's go , billy .
it's too late .
we're not prepared .
we'll go tomorrow .
it's too late .
let's put them back .
help me .
any fuck ups and we should be back by dawn .
you got everything?
maps , railroad , bus timetables .
okay , let's do it .
can you see?
no .
come on , max , get your ass down here .
this way to istanbul , baby .
watch it .
mind how you go there .
are you all right?
come down this pole and cross over .
terrific .
all right , it's a tunnel .
let's go .
come on , max .
fuck !
what is that?
shit !
shit !
it's a dead end .
the turks must have blocked it up .
shit !
billy !
what the fuck are we going to do?
what time is it?
4 : 30 .
go back .
you must be fucking joking .
we go back , seal it up , and come back tomorrow .
every night , until we get out .
there's got to be a way out .
billy , they found it .
rifki .
no do , no do .
i'm going to kick your brains all over your fucking kitchen .
fine !
good .
man to man .
when we're finished , i'll bring hamidou and he'll kick your ass .
let's go , max .
come on .
i know what i'm going to do .
what?
i'm going to cut his throat .
whose?
rifki .
what have i got to lose?
anyway , i'd really enjoy it .
why don't you sit down?
you're in no shape to kill anybody .
i want to cut his fucking throat .
it's already been cut .
then i'll cut his balls off .
you know , if you really wanted to hurt rifki ...
his money .
steal that and you steal his life's blood .
could you see his face if everything he had got snatched?
if we only knew where he hid it .
i know where it is .
max ...
the money?
them that hides can find , says l .
i've seen him , the big tit .
he looks at it , late at night .
talking to it .
where?
max , where?
the money , where?
in his radio .
in the back of his radio .
that's why he never plays it .
he never had one .
soon he's back on the street .
no friends , no money , plenty of enemies .
i'll drink to that .
me , too .
i've just got some news on jimmy .
really?
what?
they sent him to hospital .
they ruptured his hernia again .
shit !
i guess he didn't talk .
look at rifki , wearing a suit .
maybe he's got a new job .
jesus !
not again .
hashish .
you're kidding !
me?
i didn't sell him anything .
rifki's lying .
he's a liar !
rifki !
cigare , cigare , s'll vous plait .
please , listen to me .
excuse me , i've been wanting to speak to you .
you're an american?
yes , america .
my name is ahmet .
i studied philosophy at harvard , and also at oxford .
i also studied in vienna , and now i study here .
they put me here .
they say i raped a little child .
they'll never let me go .
they won't let you go , either .
they tell you they'll let you go , but in fact you stay .
you see , we all of us come from a factory .
sometimes the factory makes bad machines that don't work .
the bad machines don't know they're bad machines .
but the factory knows you are one of the machines that doesn't work .
i think we've spoken enough for today .
i wish you goodnight .
my god !
billy !
what have they done to you?
your family is fine .
senator buckley has made a special plea on your behalf .
they've called you a pawn in the game between nixon and the turks .
the letters are coming in .
people do care .
what?
take it off .
you'll just make yourself ...
take it off .
s'll vous plait .
billy ...
i wish i could make it better for you .
please , don't .
don't .
susan .
yes , billy .
i love you .
i love you .
your father gave me this for you .
there's pictures of your mom and dad , and rob and peg .
and in the back there's a picture of your old friend mr. franklin .
remember him?
from the bank .
he's over in greece now .
he bought a ticket .
i'll give it to them for you .
don't count on them .
don't count on anyone but yourself .
you're running out of time .
if you stay here , you'll die .
you've got to get yourself together .
you've got to get out of here .
good morning , my american friend .
there will be trouble if you go this way .
a good turk always walks to the right .
left is communist .
right is good .
you must go the other way .
the other way is good .
where are you going?
why don't you walk the wheel?
what is the matter , my american friend?
a bad machine doesn't know he's a bad machine .
you still don't believe you're a bad machine?
to know yourself is to know god .
the factory knows , that's why they put you here .
in time you'll know .
i already know .
you are a bad machine , that's why the factory keeps you here .
do you know how i know?
i know because i'm from the factory .
i make the machines .
max .
max !
i'm going away .
i've come to say goodbye .
you see , if i stay here , i'm going to die .
you'll die .
don't die , max .
please , don't die .
i'm going to come back for you .
you hang on for me .
you're not taking me to the sanatorium !
