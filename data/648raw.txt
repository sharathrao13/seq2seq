my unfulfilled ambition is to write a great novel in three parts about my adventures .
what adventures?
i've yet to have them , but they will be perfectly thrilling .

it is for the greatest adventure of all .

yes , mother , you don't have to go .
father can go by himself .
please , mother .
by himself?
your father is a brave man .
but he's going to need the special kiss to face his colleagues tonight .
father?
brave?
there are many different kinds of bravery .
there's the bravery of thinking of others before oneself .
now , your father has never brandished a sword nor fired a pistol , thank heavens .
but he's made many sacrifices for his family ... and put away many dreams .
where did he put them?
he put them in a drawer .
and sometimes , late at night , we take them out and admire them .
<i>but it gets harder and harder</ i> <i>to close the drawer . </ i>
he does .
and that is why he is brave .
and remember , every cloud has a silver lining .

no , it's snowing .

i wasn't crying about mothers .
i was crying because i can't get the shadow to stick .

i could sew it on for you .
this may hurt a little .
might i borrow your knife?

of course , i did nothing .

good night .
wendy?
one girl is worth more than 20 boys .
<i>you really think so? </ i>
i live with boys ... the lost boys .
they are well named .
who are they?
children who fall out of their prams when the nurse is not looking .
if they are not claimed in seven days , they are sent to the neverland .
are there girls too?
girls are much too clever to fall out of their prams .
peter , it is perfectly lovely the way you talk about girls .
i should like to give you ... a ... kiss .
don't you know what a kiss is?
i shall know when you give me one .
i suppose i'm to give you one now .
if you like .
thank you .
how old are you , peter?
quite young .

i ran away .
one night , i heard my mother and father talking of what i was to be when i became a man .
so i ran away to kensington gardens and i met tink .
tink?
tinker bell .
she's my fairy .
but there's no such thing as ...
don't say that .
every time somebody says that , a fairy somewhere falls down dead .
and i shall never find her if she's dead .

i had never thought of it that way .
<i>[ tinker bell chattering ] </ i>
<i>i suppose i did . </ i>
how wonderful .
<i>[ wendy ] </ i>
<i>my parents wanted me to grow up . </ i>
growing up is such a barbarous business , full of inconvenience and pimples .
things were simpler when i was younger .
and then the mess starts , the feelings come .
pan is so lucky to be untroubled by them .
oh , no .
he cannot love .
<i>it's part of the riddle</ i> <i>ofhis being . </ i>
cigar?
oh , there , there .
shh , shh , shh .
tsk , tsk , tsk .
it doesn't have to be this way .
didst thou ever want to be a pirate , my hearty?
i once thought of calling myself ...
mm?
red handed jill .
oh , what a marvelous name !
that's what we'll call you if you join us .
but what would my duties be?
i could not be expected to pillage .
do you , um , by any chance , tell stories?
<i>[ wendy ] </ i>
<i>and they all lived happily ... </ i> <i>ever ... after . </ i>
bravo !
<i>bravissimo . ! </ i>
might i have time to consider your generous offer?
absolutely .
of course , you must .
my fellows will return you whence they found you .
none of my crew will follow you .
i swear it .
my new obsession is you , not dear peter pan or his whereabouts .
what would mother think of my becoming a pirate?
until we meet again .

red handed jill?
she sounds quite fearsome !

red handed jill may be a brave swordsman .
a girl like her?
brave or not , i shall run her through !
<i>[ all cheering ] </ i>

'tis true , john .
your sister has been invited to piracy .
<i>[ boy ] </ i>
<i>but , mother , hook is a fiend . </ i>

on the contrary ,
i find captain hook to be a man of feeling .
mother and father are fighting again .
sir , you are both ungallant and deficient .
how am i deficient?
you're just a boy .
are you really to be a pirate , mother?
no .
we are going home .

was one of them pirates called noodler?
