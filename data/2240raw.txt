those were the years after the ice caps had melted ... because of the greenhouse gases , and the oceans had risen to drown so many cities ... along all the shorelines of the world .
amsterdam , venice , new york forever lost .
millions of people were displaced .
climates became chaotic .
hundreds of millions of people starved in poorer countries .
elsewhere , a high degree of prosperity survived ... when most governments in the developed world ... introduced legal sanctions to strictly license pregnancies , which was why robots , who are never hungry and who did not consume resources ... beyond those of their first manufacture , were so essential an economic link ... in the chain mail of society .
to create an artificial being has been the dream of man ... since the birth of science .
not merely the beginning of the modern age ... when our forbearers astonished the world with the first thinking machines primitive monsters that could play chess .
how far we have come .
the artificial being is a reality ... of perfect simulacrum ... articulated in limb , articulate in speech ... and not lacking in human response .
and even pain memory response .
how did that make you feel?
angry?
shocked?
i don't understand .
what did i do to your feelings?
you did it to my hand .
all right .
there's the rub .
undress .
at cybertronics of new jersey , the artificial being has reached its highest form .
the universally adopted mecha the basis for hundreds of models serving the human race ... in all the multiplicity of daily life .
that's far enough .
but we have no reason to congratulate ourselves .
we are rightly proud of it , but what does it amount to?
sheila , open .
a sensory toy ... with intelligent behavioral circuits ... using neurone sequencing technology ... as old as i am .
i believe that my work on mapping the impulse pathways in a single neurone ... can enable us to construct ... a mecha of a qualitatively different order .
i propose ... that we build a robot ... who can love .
love?
but we ship thousands of lover models every month .
of course .
you're your own best customer , syatyoo sama .
quality control is very important .
tell me .
what is love?
love is first widening my eyes a little bit ... and quickening my breathing a little ... and warming my skin and touching my
and so on .
exactly so .
thank you , sheila .
but i wasn't referring to sensuality simulators .
the word that i used was ``love .
love like the love of a child for its parents .
i propose that we build a robot child who can love .
a robot child who will genuinely love ... the parent or parents it imprints on ... with a love that will never end .
a child substitute mecha?
but a mecha with a mind , with neuronal feedback .
you see , what i'm suggesting is that love will be the key ... by which they acquire a kind of subconscious never before achieved .
an inner world of metaphor , of intuition , of self motivated reasoning ,
of dreams .
a robot that dreams?
yes .
how exactly do we pull this off?
you know , it occurs to me ... with all this animus existing against mechas today , it isn't simply a question of creating a robot who can love .
but isn't the real conundrum , can you get a human to love them back?
ours will be a perfect child caught in a freeze frame ... always loving , never ill , never changing .
with all the childless couples yearning in vain for a license , our little mecha will not only open up a completely new market , but it will fill a great human need .
but you haven't answered my question .
if a robot could genuinely love a person , what responsibility does that person hold toward that mecha in return?
it's a moral question , isn't it?
the oldest one of all .
but in the beginning , didn't god create adam to love him?

``the baby was born as the first leaves of autumn fell . ``a baby boy .
and marian's wish came true . ``the boy had white hair .
he was baptized martin , after his grandfather .
dr. frazier .
hi .
good to see you .
hello , henry .
listen , there was an article by random bach in the journal of chinese medicine .
they talked about these virus locators , hello again , monica . microscopic synthetic hunter killers .
did you read that article?
i can still hear you .
i'm worried about her , henry .
she's really got me worried .
yeah , i know .
she's in the most difficult position of feeling ... she should mourn the death of your son .
after five years , your instincts tell you to mourn him too .
but medicine assures us that mourning is inappropriate
that martin is merely pending .
pending .
so all her grief goes undigested .
henry , your son may be beyond our science , but it's your wife who can still be reached .
the screening process was extremely difficult .
it was almost tougher than building the prototype .
of our 2, 000 employees , a surprising few ... met your minimum requirements for the in house testing .
initiate .
employment record , quality of lifestyle
query , internal data
loyalty to the firm , and in this individual's case , a family tragedy that may qualify him above the rest .
i'll see him .
henry don't kill me .
henry , what are you doing?
i love you .
don't kill me .
the door's closed .
i like your floor .
i can't accept this
there is no substitute for your own child
you don't have to accept it or even try .
it's not too late to take him back .
what were you thinking?
shh .
i'll do whatever you want me to do .
do you think i can just
i can just  i'll do whatever you want me to do
i don't know what to do .
i know , i know .
i'll return him to cybertronics first thing in the morning .
it's gone .
good .
i mean , henry , did you see his face?
he's [ sighs ]
he's so real .
but he's not .
no , he's not .
i mean , inside he's like all the rest , isn't he?
a hundred miles of fiber , yeah .
but outside , he just looks so real
like he is a child .
a mecha child .
a child .
the show of faith my company has placed on me , on us , is extraordinary .
now , there are a few simple procedures we need to follow ... if and when you decide to keep david .
if you decide to keep him , there's an imprinting protocol ... consisting of a code string of seven particularwords ... which need to be spoken to david in the predefined order that's been printed here .
now , monica , for our own protection , this imprinting is irreversible .
the robot child's love would be sealed in a sense , hardwired and would be part of him forever .
because of this , after imprinting , no mecha child can be resold .
if an adopted parent should ever decide not to keep the child , they must return it to cybertronics for destruction .
i had to sign a letter of agreement , or they wouldn't even let you see david .
you have to sign it too .
right here .
monica , don't imprint until you're entirely sure .
silly man .
of course i'm not sure .
would you like me to sleep now?
good idea .
good idea .
um
monica?
uh , well , it's late , you know .
it's after 900 , so  yeah .
ten past .
how how late do they let you stay up?
i can never go to sleep .
but i can lay quietly and not make a peep .
so , those pajamas will fit you , and we'll be in to check on you first thing in the morning .
dress me?
you know , i'm gonna say good night while you boys be boys .
raise your arms .
is it a game?
yes .
hide and seek .
i found you .
i found you .
out out get out of here
and close the goddamn door
is it a game?
now , i'm gonna read some words .
and , uh , they won't make any sense , and look at me all the time .
can you do that?
yes , monica .
can you feel my hand on the back of your neck?
yes .
does any of this hurt?
no .
okay , now , look at me .
ready?
cirrus .
socrates .
particle .
decibel .
hurricane .
dolphin .
tulip .
monica .
david .
monica .
all right .
i wonder if i did that right .
i don't
what were those words for , mommy?
what did you call me?
mommy .
who am i , david?
you are my mommy .
# [ humming ]
mmm .
you smell lovely .
i love it when you wear this stuff .
will you still love me when it's all gone?
no .
stop it .
but we can get married again ... and begin with a fragrance that's not in such short supply .
we gotta go .
come on .
we're late .
hello , david .
hello , henry .
walk us out , all right , sweet heart?
come on .
my shoe [ chuckling ]
henry , your tie !
i know , i know .
you're hopeless !
he's trying so hard to please you .
he has a way with my coffee .
and it's creepy .
you can never hear him coming .
he's just always there .
he is only a child .
monica , he's a toy .
he's a gift ... from you .
david , when we leave , all the doors and windows will go smart .
so you can't leave your room .
but if you'd like
oh , i put way too much on .
do i smell lovely?
oh , god , no .
mommy , will you die?
well , one day , david , yes , i will .
i'll be alone .
don't worry yourself so .
how long will you live?
for ages .
for 50 years .
i love you , mommy .
i hope you never die .
never .
yes .
darling !
we're becoming unfashionably , unreasonably late .
hello?
this belonged to martin , my son .
ahh !
his name is teddy .
teddy , this is david .
hello , teddy .
hello , david .
david , teddy is a super toy , and i know you will take good care of each other .
i am not a toy .
henry?
sorry .
what were you doing up there?
i'll tell you in the car .
come on .
is 50 years a long time?
i don't think so .
david , i'll get it !
honey , hand it to me .
look what i can do .
hello?
yes?
mrs. swinton , could you hold a moment?
i have an urgent call from your husband .
yes , i will .
david , i i need to talk to the phone now .
monica?
monica?
can you hear me , monica?
let the phone talk now .
monica , can you hear me?
pick up the phone , monica !
run along .
play with teddy .
pick up the phone , monica !
oh , my god !
mon
hello , henry?
what is it?
what
what?
when?
oh , god .
david , the most wonderful thing in the whole world has happened .
this is martin .
this is my son .
martin , no !
we'll have a contest to see who he comes to first .
come here , teddy !
come here , boy !
teddy !
come here !
you call him too .
come here , teddy .

come !
mommy !
mommy !
are they torturing you , teddy?
he used to be a super toy , but now he's old and stupid .
you want him?
yes , please .
so i guess now you're the new super toy .
so , what good stuff can you do?
oh , can you do power stuff , like walk on the ceiling or the walls?
anti gravity?
like , float or fly?
can you?
no , because i'm real .
can you break this?
i better not .
these things , they do look better in pieces .
they do .
i can't .
stand up .
look , they made you bigger than me .
who did?
well , they did the doll makers .
they made you taller .
why don't you look like one? ``like one "?
you're not cute like a doll .
you just look like someone's ordinary kid .
when's your birthday?
i never had a birthday .
okay .
when were you first built?
when's your ``build day "?
i don't remember .
okay , what's the first thing you can remember?
a bird .
what sort of bird?
a bird with big wings ... and feathers sticking up from the bottom .
can you draw it?
yes .
that looks like a peacock .
can you say ``peacock "?
peacock .
can you say ``pee "?
pee .
now say that two times fast .
okay .
then you gotta put the green ones
read to us?
hey .
let's see .
oh , yeah .
david's going to love it .
``as soon as his show was over , the showman went into the kitchen , ``where the whole sheep which he was preparing for supper ... ``was roasting on the slowly turning spit in the furnace . ``when he saw there was not enough wood to finish roasting it , ``he called harlequin and the punchinello and said , ``bring me in pinocchio .
you will find him hanging on a nail . ``he is made of nice , dry wood , ``and i'm sure he will make a nice fire for my roast . '``pinocchio worked until midnight . `and instead of making eight baskets , ``he made sixteen . ``then he went to bed and fell asleep . ``as he slept , he dreamt he saw the fairy , lovely and smiling , ``who gave him a kiss , saying , ``brave pinocchio , ``in return for your good heart , i forgive all your past misdeeds . ``be good in future , and you will be happy . ``then the dream ended and pinocchio awoke , ``full of amazement . ``you can imagine how astonished he was ... ``when he saw that he was no longer a puppet ... but a real boy just like other boys .
josephine evidently has taken a leave of absence .
oh , my god .
mm hmm .
well , i saw that coming .
how could you see that coming?
they were fabulous together .
oh , come on !
she was miserable !
i mean
well , he never said they were miserable .
yeah , that's because
wasn't that because of the cutbacks?
i have no idea .
actually , they don't tell me anything .
do they really have a weight problem?
so do i.
you do not .
that is ridiculous .
all right , look .
i don't know .
there's something about inner beauty that
you will break .
oh , that is ridiculous !
exactly .
work has become so silly .
i know what you're talking about .
does he eat?
i'm not sure .
you're not supposed to do that .
david , what are you doing?
david !
martin , put the fork down .
is it in the manual book?
stop .
stop , david .
put it down now .
david , stop it !
martin , you're provoking him , okay?
stop it .
stop it , david !
the two of you , stop it !
stop it !
stop it now !
stop it !
david , stop it !
there's sputum in the code lockers .
smell that garlic .
we should throw in a chest mint .
can you locate the service?
don't touch the merchandise .
it's all swamp in here .
you made a mess of yourself .
spinach is for rabbits , people and popeye , not robo boys .
try to insert yourself .
now through the pantry , all the lower shelves .
it's okay , mommy .
it doesn't hurt .
the activators are all shut down on the left side .
monica .
shh .
i have to
i have to
that's not all of it .
that's not all of it .
if you do something really , really , really special for me , a special mission , then i'll go tell mommy ...
i love you .
and then she'll love you too .
what shall i do?
you have to promise , and then i'll tell you .
you have to tell me , and then i'll promise .
i want a lock of mommy's hair .
i'll share it with you .
and if you had it and wore it , she might love you even more .
like the princess in the movie we saw .
when she had the prince's hair in her necklace thing , he loved her .
we can ask her .
no , it has to be a secret mission .
sneak into mommy's bedroom in the middle of the night ... and chop it off .
i can't , martin .
i'm not allowed .
you promised .
you said , ``tell me , and then i'll promise .
didn't you?
david !
why did you do that?
why did you do that?
what are you doing?
you're hurting him !
talk to me !
goddamn it !
why did you do that?
why did you do that?
you're hurting him !
you're hurting him !
don't break him !
why did you do that?
henry , i wanted mommy to love me ... more .
oh , my god .
what?
i think i cut my eye .
oh , god , i think it's bleeding .
let me see .
it's normal for little boys to feel jealous and competitive .
martin's only been home a month , and it's normal for brothers to challenge each other .
he was playing a game , he made a mistake , and
he's practically human .
that's not how he looked holding the knife .
scissors .
it was a weapon .
why do you keep imagining that he was purposely trying to harm me?
because we don't know the answer to that .
how is he worth the risk to you or to martin or to us as a family?
i will not let you take him back .
you told me what would happen ...
if we ever took him back .
think about this .
if he was created to love , then it's reasonable to assume he knows how to hate .
and if pushed to those extremes , what is he really capable of?
happy birthday , martin .
i made this for you .
this him?
is this your little brother?
technically , no .
he's mecha .
what's mecha?
we're organic , you're mechanical .
orga , mecha .
orga , mecha .
orga , mecha .
todd , stop !
i didn't know they even made little kids .
can you pee?
i cannot .
then let's see what you can't pee with .
come on .
touch it .
it feels so real .
oh , that's that's creepy .
wow .
it feels so real .
that is too real .
mecha real .
does he have das?
das what?
das istgut !
damage avoidance system .
das .
it's a pain alert system .
our serving man has it .
it's so they don't go picking up fire with their bare hands and stuff .
watch .
watch this .
now , i'm not gonna cut you .
this isn't gonna hurt .
i'm not gonna cut your skin .
just tell me when you feel it .
keep me safe , martin .
keep me safe .
let me go !
keep me safe , martin .
keep me safe .
keep me safe .
let me go !
mom !
mom !
mom !
keep me safe .
keep me safe .
keep me safe .
keep me safe .
henry !
oh , my oh , my god !
oh , my god !
he's not breathing !
he's not breathing !
come on , martin !
come on !
take a breath .
take a breath .
cough it up .
that a boy .
that's a great boy .
oh , my god .
thank god .
hey , david?
mommy !
mommy .
i i need to speak to you for a minute , okay?
okay .
these are beautiful .
thank you .
um [ sniffes ]
um , hey , david , i was thinking that ... we could go for a drive tomorrow in the country .
you and me .
what do you say?
and teddy?
yeah , and teddy .
thank you , mommy .
thank you so much .
tomorrow is gonna be just for us , okay?
where are we going?
some place nice?
are those happy tears?
what's for dinner tonight?
you know you don't eat .
yes .
but i like sitting at the table .
david?
david , come on .
david david
listen listen to me !
david?
david , listen .
now ... you won't understand the reasons , but ...
i have i have to leave you here .
is it a game?
no .
when will you come back for me?
i'm not , david .
you'll have to be here by yourself .
alone?
with teddy .
no .
no , no , no , no , no , no !
no , mommy , please !
no , no !
please , no , mommy !
shh , shh , shh .
they will destroy you .
no !
no , mommy !
i'm sorry i broke myself .
i'm so sorry i cut your hair off ...
and i'm sorry i hurt you and i hurt martin .
i have to go !
i have to go !
stop it !
stop it !
i have to go now !
mommy , no !
mommy !
mommy , if pinocchio became a real boy ... and i become a real boy , can i come home?
that's just a story .
but a story tells what happens .
stories are not real !
you're not real !
now , listen to me .
look .
look !
take this , all right?
take this .
don't let anyone see how much it is .
now , look , don't go that way .
look !
look at me !
look !
don't go that way , all right?
go anywhere but that way or they'll catch you .
don't ever let them catch you !
listen , stay away from flesh fairs , away from where there are lots of people .
stay away from all people .
only others like you .
only mecha are safe .
i gotta go .
why do you wanna leave me?
why do you wanna leave me?
i'm sorry i'm not real .
if you let me , i'll be so real for you .
let go .
let go , david .
let go !
i'm sorry i didn't tell you about the world .
i'm afraid .
of me?
yes .
that i will hurt you?
yes .
i think ... you're afraid of letting go .
i think you're afraid of happiness .
and this is starting to excite me .
are you afraid of seeing the stars ,
patricia?
i can show you how to reach them .
i'm afraid of what you've got under there .
may i see what it looks like first?
is this your first time ... with something like me?
i've never been with mecha .
that makes two of us .
i'm afraid it will hurt .
patricia , once you've had a lover robot , you'll never want a real man ... again .
are these the wounds of passion?

no expiration date , no i. d.
what's a new model doing loose and unregistered?
sir , it's a late generation lover mecha .
well , there's a relief from all this antique iron .
you are certain he's not a man?
i wouldn't want a repeat of the trenton incident .
