no , food poisoning , i think .
it's goddamn freezing on this beach .
montauk in february .
brilliant, joel .
page is ripped out .
don't remember doing that .
it appears this is my first entry in two years .
sand is overrated .
it'sjust tiny little rocks .
ifonly i could meet someone new .
i guess my chances ofthat happening are somewhat diminished , seeing that i'm incapable ofmaking eye contact with a woman i don't know .
maybe i should get back together with naomi .
she was nice .
nice is good .
she loved me .
why do i fall in love with every woman i see ... who shows me the least bit ofattention?
hi .
i 'm sorry?
i just said hi .
hi .
hello .
hi .

what might?
it changes a lot .
the color .
that's whyyou might not recognize me .
it's called blue ruin , the color .
right .
yeah .
snappy name , huh?
ilike it .
yeah .
anyway , this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names .
red red menace , yellow fever , green revolution .
that'd be a job , coming upwith those names .

i mean , how many hair colors could there be?
fifty , maybe .
someone's got thatjob .

now , the , uh the first thing we need you to do , mr. barish , is to go home ... andcollect evertyhingyou own that has some association with clementine .

okay?
so we'll need , uh , uh , photos , clothing , gifts , books she may have boughtyou , cds you may have bought together , journal entries .
we want to emptyyour home
we want to emptyyour life ofclementine .
and after the mapping is done , our technicians will do the erasing in your home tonight .
that way , when you awake in the morning , you'll findyourselfin your own bed as ifnothing had happened a new life awaitingyou .

canyou do that?
february is very busy for us because ofvalentine's day .
** [ dixielandjazz ]
this is , uh , stan fink , one ofourmost experienced andskilled technicians .
** [ continues ]
he'll be handling your case tonight .
great to meetyou , mr. barish .
my name is joel barish , and i'm here to erase clementine kruczynski .
very good .
now , tell me about , uh , clementine .
uh , i was ...
iiving with this woman , naomi , uh , a coupleyears ago , and my friends rob and carrie invited us to this party at the beach i don't like parties .
naomi couldn't go , but i went ... and i , uh , met clementine .
i'm sorry .
let's start with your most recent memories ... and work backwards from there , more or less .
there's an emotional core ... to each of our memories , and when you eradicate that core it starts its degradation process .
bythe timeyou wake up in the morning , all the memories we've targeted will havewithered and disappeared , as in a dream upon waking .
is there any risk ofbrain damage?
well , uh , technically speaking , the procedure is brain damage , but it's on a parwith a night ofheavy drinking .
nothing you'll miss .
comfortable?
whatwe're doing here , mr. barish , is actually creating a map ofyour brain .
okay , let's getstarted .
ifwe want to get thisprocedure underwaytonight , we have some work to do .
i want you to react to these objects , mr. barish , ifyou will .
there's a good story behind this one
uh , actually , mr. barish , i'll get a much better emotional readout ... ifyou refrain from any sort of verbal description ofthe items .
just tryto focus on the memories .
oh .
sorry .
okay .
healthyactivityup there again .
healthyreadouts .
verygood .
here's another object .
that's so
next item .
okay .
potato head .
next item .
okay .
just focus on the memories .
patrick , do me a favor .
hey , patrick , do me a favor , willya?
yeah .
can you check the voltage regulator?
what do we got there?
u h , voltage looks fine .
really?
well , i'm not wiping as clean as i like here .
i'm [ scoffs ]
well , uh , technicallythe procedure is brain damage .
check the , uh check the connections , please .
oh , there you are .
i
why am i i don't understand what i'm looking at .
why am i standing here and
oh , my god .
deja vu .
deja vu .
this is so
all right , we should get started .
ifwe're gonna get the procedure ... [ simultaneously ]
underwaytonight , we have somework to do .
i'm in my head already , aren't i?
i suppose so .
uh , this is about right .
this is what it this is what itwould look like .
very good .
we'll dispose ofthese mementos when we're done here .
thatwayyou won't be confused later bytheir unexplainable presence in your home .
ah , therewe go .
patrick?
yeah?
patrick , canyou check patrick?

this is weird .
toallpatients ofdr .
howardmierzwiak .
myname is marysvevo .
we've met , butyou don't remember me .
i worked for a companyyou hired to have part ofyour memory erased .
ihavesince decided that this is a horrible some kind ofteaser ad or something .
in orderto correct this , i'm sending everyone's file back to them .
myname is clementine kruczynski .
i'm here to erasejoel barish .
what is this?
i don't know .
he's boring .
is that enough reason to erase someone?
i've been thinking lately how i was before and how i am now , and it's like he changed me .
i feel like i'm always pissy now .
i don't like myselfwhen i'm with him .
i don't like myselfanymore .
i can't stand to even look at him .
that pathetic , wimpy , apologetic smile .
that sort ofwounded puppyshit he does , you know?
what are you doing?
i 'm not doing anything .
the bloom is certainly fucking offthe rose at this point .
are you screwing with me?
no !
you are screwing with me .
joel , i'm not !
you clearly are .
look , let's just take a minute and
patrick , get the fuckaway .
oh , sweetheart get the fuck away from me !
can we talk about it?
no !
get the fuck away !
joel barish .
hey , clementine .
hey .
nice to seeyou .
yeah .
yeah .
reallyveryeducated .
i mean , she's smart , i think , but not educated .
i couldn't reallytalk to her about books, you know?
she's more of a magazine reading girl .
hervocabularyleaves something to be desired .
sometimes i was embarrassed in public ...
hi . because she wouldpronounce ...
iibrary " libary . " hi .
libary .
libary .
look what i found .
i think ifthere's a trulyseductive quality about clementine , it's that herpersonalitypromises to take you out ofthe mundane .
you made me look skinny .
amazing , burning meteorite ... will carryyou to another world where things are exciting .
but whatyou quickly learn is that ... it's really an elaborate ruse .
i 'm sorry i yelled at you .
it's okay .
so flashy in a kind ofobvious way .
but still , it seduces you .
joel , i really like you .
i hate that i said mean things aboutyou .
let me turn this off , okay?
hey , it's it's onlyfair .
where's the real clementine?
i mean , the whole thing with the hair it's all bullshit .
i really like your hair .
thankyou .
i reallylikeyourhair .
thankyou .
i do .
the world's a goddamn mess .
is it some kind ofa revolt?
changeyourhair color .
you want a drink or something?
do you have anywhiskey?
no , i don't think hersex is ... motivated .
i sawit clearly the last night we were together .
it wasn't sex .
it wasjust sad .
hey .
sorry .
i thought there was more .
the only way clem thinks she can get people to like her ... is to fuck 'em ... or at least dangle the possibility ofgetting fucked in front of'em .
and she's so desperate and insecure ... that she'll , sooner or later , go around fucking everybody .
i don't do that .
i wouldn't think that aboutyou .
because i don't .
i know .
because it reallyhurts me thatyou said that because i don't do that .
i'm so sorry .
i'm sorry about all this .
i'm gonna ... go .
i'm a little confused .
i don't really think i can be here .
um ... bye .
bye .
i thought i knewherso well .
itwas nice meeting you and all .
but i don't knowherat all .
what a loss tospend that much time with someone , onlyto findout thatshe's a stranger .
wait .
what?
i don't know .
just wait . just wait .
what doyou want, joel?
i don't know .
i want you to wait for ... just a while .
okay .
really?
i'm not a concept, joel .
i'mjust a fucked up girl who's looking formy own peace ofmind .
i'm not perfect .
i can't see anything that i don't like about you .
right now i can't .
but you will .
butyou will .
you know , you will thinkofthings , and i'll get bored with you and feel trapped ... because that's what happens with me .
okay .
okay .
okay .
okay .
