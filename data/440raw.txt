'if you can't get here , our search and rescue teams will find you . '
my brother's there .
he's waiting for me .
what's the holdup , darling?

ok .
that's one idea .
what about locking this place down?
sooner or later , they'll get in .
that's good .
i hadn't thought of that .
no doubt .
you probably already thought about putting a sign up on the roof cos there's still planes in the air .
might be good to let them know we're alive .
we can get paint from case hardware .
use doors to board up the weak spots .
that's a solid plan .
cj , is it?
yeah .
all right , cj .
listen up .
i'm giving everybody a job and i expect you to do it .
i don't want to see any half assin '.
you can start by cleaning up that mess you made in metropolis .

i'm going to fort pastor to get my brother .
'they seem to need to feed on warm flesh .
'some basic skills remain .
'they don't seem to have much , if any , reasoning power . '

'god bless america . '

cos if it is , i'm fucked .
i'm serious .
i've done some bad things .
oh , i get it .
you saw hell yesterday , now you're scared of going to hell for all the bad things you've done .
go in the stall , say five hail marys , wipe your ass , and you and god can call it even .
you think i feel like i deserve to be here?
yeah .
well , i don't .
and i'm cool with that .
but that's not it .
i feel like i'm here for another reason .
i feel like i'm here to bring that baby on this earth and give it everything that i never had .
i just want the opportunity to change things .
shit !
cj ! how did you get out?
who said you could loot the stores?
what are we going to do about that truck?
nothing .
there's people in it .
how do you know they're not fucked up?
for one thing , they're driving a truck .
oh , and shooting guns .
we might let the wrong ones in .
then i'm dead .
and i don't want to die .
who are the wrong ones?
nobody here is sick .
it stays that way .
i think ...
i did not ask for your opinion ! if you want to argue , argue with this .
relax shut your fucking mouth .
move the gun .
you can't turn them away .
they'll die .
tough shit .
self defense .
i won't kill anybody .

there are six more people in the truck ! andre !

i couldn't stay in that fucking truck anymore .
anybody who's injured , go to metropolis .
i'll take a look at you .
let me take a look at her .
can you help me?
what's your name?
glen .
yeah , sure .
just give me a second to collect myself .
thanks .

i'll look at your leg .

yeah .
we're just going right there .
oh , my arm .
we'll make you nice and comfortable .
we got plenty of food and water .
help should be along soon .
help?
you hear that from the same jackass who said to go to st .
verbena?
the church downtown?
yeah .
it's the first place i went .
some dipshit on the radio said it was safe .
he was wrong .
that's where you got them?
i got a call on the cb from glen saying these folks were in the chapel .
he's a priest?
no , he plays the organ .
i was in the neighborhood so i picked them up .
well done .
thanks .
excuse me , when you two fellows are done blowing each other , maybe davy crockett can tell us the deal .
since the tvs went down ...
excuse me .
whose rig is that?
it's mine .
you mind if i borrow it?
i'm not using it .
keys?
they're in the cab .
the truck won't make it to fort pastor .
forget it .
that place is fucked .
bloodbath city .
how do you know?
we just came from there .
is everyone there dead?
dead ish .
is everyone there dead?
yeah .
in the sense that they all sort of fell down and then ...
i have to see .
you won't make it . ... got up and ...
i'll get as far as i can .
one foot . ... started eating each other .
i'll take my chances .
don't be an idiot .
please .
the people here could use your help .
fuck y'all .
it's nice to see you've all bonded through this disaster .
hey .
you need anything?
no , we're fine .
he's got a bite on his hand .
she's cold .
that's good , right?
i don't know .
it's weird .
an infection this bad usually comes with a fever .
that guy's arm looks pretty bad .
you should check it out .
all right .
stay with her for a minute .
let me take a look at that .
i'm fine , really .
they don't hurt much .
tucker could use you more than me .
his ankle's cut pretty bad .
i'll just clean it up a bit .
you ok?
ma'am , can i get you something?
like a glass of water?
anal ana , come here !
anyone know her name?
died without a name?
damn .
you wanna use the other room?
holy shit !
holy shit .
holy shit .
i think it's the bites .
frank said she was walking on her own five hours ago .
the bites killed her .
the bites brought her back .
how do you know?
i watched it happen .
i felt her pulse , she was gone .
then ... yesterday i saw the same thing .
i think that's why it spread so fast .
all right .
so who else in the group is bitten?
frank for sure .
and the one with the foot?
tucker?
he says no , he fell .
so it's frank .
tall guy , right?
right .
so we have to quarantine him .
where do we do that?
there must be a place in here .
then what?
i don't know .
but ... it's too dangerous to keep him here .
what are we talking about?
are we talking about killing him?
you'd rather wait for him to die and then he kills us?
yes .
no .
you can't kill him .
he's got a daughter ! i'm sorry .
there's no other choice .
he's right .
michael , no .
what if i'm wrong?
you've seen it happen before .
frank .
michael's coming to shoot you .
what?
you're infected .
you're going to become one of them .
is this true?
are you here to kill me?
you were bitten .
it's only a matter of time .
no .
no .
no .
leave my dad alone .
go away .
you can't do this .
you have to understand that she's lost everyone .
her mother , her two brothers .
i'm all she's got .
well , michael , what are you waiting for?
go ahead .
kill him .
hey , kill tucker , too .
wait a minute .
i was never bit .
we can't be sure .
do it , michael .
are you sure it's the bite?
no .
she's sure .
i'm sorry .
hey .
hi .
are you ok?
mm .
let me see your arm .
it hurts .
it's already starting to heal .
andre , i can't have baby here .
why not?
people have had babies for millions of years , all on their own , no hospitals .
wait .
oh , yeah .
it's moving .
i felt it .
we gotta come up with a name .
i want russian name .
don't start that .
african name .
please?
come here and give me a hug .
sweetie .
i'm so proud .
i couldn't ask for anything more in a daughter .
i love you .
i love you too .
time to go , honey .
no .
terry , come on .
open the door .
shut up .
don't tell me to shut up .
open the door .
i got you this job .
come on .

ana .
i'm glad you didn't do it .
ok , here's a good one .
top ten ingredients to a successfu i relationship .
i'm gonna skip to the top three .
number three . " he listens to me .
number two . " he tells me he loves me .

you guys had rough childhoods?
a little bit rocky?
hey , sweetheart , let me tell you something .
you have my permission if i ever turn into one of those things , blow my fucking head off .
oh , yeah , you can count on that .
i guess the first time i knew i was gay i was 13 .
this guy , todd , he was building a deck in our backyard ... oki just , please , stop .
he had the most astonishing blue eyes .
oh , my god ! i'm in hell .
how's luda doing?
she's fine .
hey , where's that lemon stuff?
it's all gone .
steve likes to put it in his booze .

i'd like to check on her , see how she's doing .
no , thanks .
she's fine .
you sure?
yeah , i'm sure .
it's ok , hon .
we understand .
thanks .
and before that , i worked in a stationery store .
and i drove a snowplow .
fixed copiers .
it's a shame this whole end of the world thing's holding you back .
ok , worst job .
i know which job i was the worst at it was being a husband .
that's not a job .
it sure is .
you guys just haven't met the right girl .
i tried it three times and ...
i got pink slips every time .
what were you best at?
being a dad .
i think i was best at that .
calm down .

no .
are there generators?
shh .
ok , shh .
shhh ... it's all right , baby .
baby , please .
you got to be quiet , ok?
it's gonna be all right .
our baby is on the way .

that's it .
it's in employee parking level 3 .
they're in a pen near the parking shuttles .
have fun .
wait a minute .
you're coming too .
no , i'm not .
i said i'd tell you where the generators are , not show you .
did you think i'd just leave you two up here?
you come with me or go back in the cell .
all right .
i ain't going anywhere without a gun .
you're not getting a gun .
trust .
the primary ingredient in any relationship .
have at 'em , cowboy .
asshole .
bart , get the chains .
you ready to roll?
you're coming with us?
no , you're coming with me .
i've done this before .
know how to use that?
this one's the dangerous end , right?
now it is .
this is level 1 . we gotta walk down to 3 .
what the fuck was that?
i just saw something .
you didn't see shit .
shut the fuck up .
oh , shit .
here it comes .
jesus christ .
it's a fucking dog .
come here , boy .
nothing's here or it would've eaten him .
see?
i told you i saw something .
what's wrong , boy?
there's nothing wrong .
that dog's just fucked up .
run !
wait , cj ! wait up ! wait ! it's locked ! it's fucking locked !
come on , let's go !
cj !
i'm out !
cj ! matches !
breathe .
you're doing good .
breathe .
you're doing good , baby .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
thanks .
ok .
that's the last .
i'm gonna go check on luda .
i'll go .
you sure?
yeah .
i'll take them some candles .
ok .
let me know if they need anything .
i'll have a smoke on the way .
see you .
bye .
it's coming .
i see it .
guys?
oh , my god .
it's a girl .
oh ...
you want to kill luda?
you want to kill my family?
normal come on , norma .
what happened?
the son of a bitch shot me .
get away from her .
wait .
just wait .
she died of the gunshot .
she wasn't bitten .
but she'll wake up , right?
no .
no , if she was one of them , she'd be up by now .
terry?
yeah .
hold this .
oh , god .
somebody should say something .
yeah .
glen?
no .
you worked in the church .
i played the organ .
you must have heard the priest say something about life and death .
it was a job .
i don't believe in god .
i don't see how anyone could .
somebody should say something .
there's nothing to say .
i've been to a lot of funerals .
i've folded the flag and given it to a lot of wives and fathers and kids and told them how sorry i was .
but that's not what i was really feeling .
in the back of my mind , i was always saying , " better them than me .
but i don't believe that now .
now i realize there are some things worse than death and one of them is sitting here waiting to die .
i don't want to die here .
i saw a couple of buses in the garage .
we could reinforce them , then get as far from here as possible .
and then what?
i have an idea .
um ... why don't we swing by the marina and hop in my boat and take it for a pleasure cruise , you jackasses .
wait .
there's islands in the lakes , there's not a lot of people on them .
i was kidding .
how far is the marina?
oh , my god !
you're serious?
i think it's a damn good idea .
how about the rest of you?
kenneth?
yeah , it's a good idea .
we have to pick up andy .
he's part of the group .
excuse me .
not to shit on anyone's riff but let me see if i grasp this concept .
you're saying we take the parking shuttles , reinforce them with aluminum siding and then head to the gun store where our friend andy plays some cowboy movie , jump on the wagon bullshit .
then we drive across a ruined city through thousands of dead cannibals , all so we can sail off into the sunset on this fucking asshole's boat?
and head for some island which may not even exist?
yeah .
pretty much , yeah .
yeah .
ok .
i'm in .
we have 12 of these shotgun shells , 26 of those pussy .
9 mils , and 16 of the .
357 magnums .
yeah?
that's still not very much , so hopefully there won't be too many of them at the dock .
nice to see you busting your ass .
oh , that's sarcasm .
that is awesome .
you know , i would love to help but , er , a captain never works alongside his men .
you guys have a good 'un .
what a total dick .
guys , where did chips go?
chips?
i can't find him .
chips?
come on , chips !
" come on , chips ! " where'd you go , honey?
there you are .
there's my boy .
don't you ever leave me again , ok?
ever , ever .
hey .
kenneth wants a meeting upstairs .
come in here first .
i want you to see this .
when those things are on the side of the bus , this'll get them off .
cool , huh?
wow .
that might be the most romantic thing anyone's ever shown me .
i'm trying here .
yeah , i know .
it's not just about him starving .
if we pick him up and he doesn't have his strength , we'll be carrying him .
she's right .
he's a hell of a shot .
we need him .
i'm not saying we don't .
there's no point in arguing .
we need to get some food over there .
i know .
we draw straws and the loser runs across the lot with a ham sandwich .
could you be a bigger prick?
yes , but that's irrelevant .
my question is , what's your plan?
come on !
i got it .
shut up ! ... more ammunition .
i have an idea .
it's hurting him ! it's not safe ! they're not interested in him .
they want us , ok?
chips is gonna be fine .
see?
look , they're not even paying attention to him .
the walkie's in the bag?
yeah .
let me see .
let me see !
there he is .
good boy .
good boy , chips .
ok , he's there , he's in .
