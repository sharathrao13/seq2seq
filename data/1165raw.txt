where's everyone going?
probably to a fair .
or on a pilgrimage .
we've been gone a while , majesty , so it's hard to tell .
a while?? !
seven years in battle ... and all for nothing .
where are you going?
straight on out of here .
wasn't that king dobromil the good?
him?
just some vagrant knight .
but if it was , to the devil with him !
music
and we're home .
the devll knows why
what the devil? dobromil !
director of photography
he's returned !
the king has returned !
executive producer
produced by
directed by
the king's here !
what'll we do?
nothing ...
oh , the devil !
welcome , your majesty !
what's going on?
everything's running like clockwork .
seems like everything's running away that has legs .
we missed you , you old crab .
i bet you did .
and where's annie to greet me?
where is my daughter?
gadding about , majesty .
she hops on her horse and whoosh !
she hops on her horse and what?
and whoosh !
you let that child go off on her own?
what child , majesty?
she's ready for marriage .
hear that?
my daughter's grown up .
at least something went right .
apollonia , are things really as bad as all that?
this kingdom was never in such a fix before .
can't we do anything about it?
leave , like everyone else .
are you serious?
don't worry , i'm staying .
and besides i had a vision ...
something came to me in a dream .
again?
i fried up these unusual mushrooms with onions , and after i ate them i felt dizzy .
i fell down , like this , among the flowers ...
ow !
and slept sound as a log .
well , what did you dream?
our land ... saved by a young man .
i don't know why , but he'll be very ticklish .
and he'll call you daisy .
me?
why me?
how should i know?
what does he look like?
i didn't see his face but he's a good soul .
he's brave , honest , honorable ... and an ass .
i might have guessed .
no , he's not an ass .
i saw an ass .
our rescuer will ride a donkey .
maybe .
or maybe not .
maybe you just ate some crazy mushrooms .
that brute is killing that horse .
a foul land breeds foul people .
what can you do?
i'm going over there .
hey , wait !
stay here .
oh , alright ...
i'll make a good man of him .
get lost , you loser !
that's all we need , dammit !
just sitting there like a dolt?
help me !
stop this insanity !
it's your fault .
you drove that horse like a madman .
the sooner we're gone the better .
what now , you freeloaders !
you're the devil's own !
the chickens !
the chickens !
so catch them , you good for nothings !
to hell with ... !
pull !
pull !
pull !
what are you gawking at?
look at yourselves , you pigs !
why are you screaming?
we caught the hens like you said .
butt out !
or would you like a whipping too?
i'll teach you to get so dirty !
don't you feel stupid?
venting your rage at women and children?
well , look here ...
it's the good fairy .
i'm no fairy , you dolt .
get lost !
or you'll get a taste too .
run , kids !
there you are , you beasts .
get over here , you brats !
i'll teach you to hide from me !
no , daddy !
i'll catch the chickens .
i'm going to ring your necks anyway !
i'll teach you to obey me !
let me go !
hey !
what?
you dropped your hat ...
what a monster i am .
run and play .
my darlings !
give me a hug .
we live in the grip of an inexorable law which dictates that money circulates , gyrates , rotates , and circulates again .
just like the blue blood in your majesty's veins .
and then suddenly ...
wham bam , the current clogs .
put a sock in it , you !
i reacted like a statesman .
i let half the staff go .
all the best people .
shut up !
they cost the most .
then i dismissed the troops .
impossible !
my loyal men?
but we're at peace , majesty .
i fired everyone .
why should we cook so much?
he wants us to starve .
shut your trap !
waste not , want not , majesty .
so how much have we saved?
how ... how ... how much?
how much? from out of nowhere this melody popped in my head .
a tiny idea for a new anthem .
listen ...
our king dobromil ...
stop gawking !
dobromil # 8 , umpah tralala , wakes up feeling great !
umpah tralala ...
to the treasury , you tralala !
this is our treasury?
yes , it is .
let's have a look ...
corn !
where are the ducats?
ducats?
i gave the last one to a gypsy fortuneteller .
and when she looked at my palm she cried out , " the devil's eye !
isn't that exciting?
what were you doing the whole time?
we were expecting ... the spoils of your wars .
oh , shut up !
what do you propose?
we've got one hope .
you need ducats !
and it takes ducats to make ducats .
the question is how to get them?
only by striking some advantageous bargain .
the only business around here is with hell .
everyone else is broke .
i'm afraid , majesty , that this time i agree with the jester .
you mean to say you think i should do business with hell?
what other option do we have?
what business do you have in mind?
we could sell ... hell ... souls , your majesty .
souls?
whose souls were you imagining?
whose?
majesty , i ...
i'm prepared to sacrifice myself .
you know very well no one wants your soul .
can you tell me why your wife's feeding geese here?
she's got this bizarre idea she'll make swans of them .
she herself is really a silly goose .
she's mad as a hatter .
majesty , things are looking up .
i've assigned tax collecting units .
shut up already !
aaagh !
oh , man , you'll see !
what if we found annie a rich husband?
the poor can't and the rich won't .
and woe is us !
help !
help !
i'm drowning !
grab hold and quit screaming .
strange , eh?
i save you and almost bite it .
what are you looking at?
i wanted to help you .
you looked like a corpse .
where are we exactly?
in the land of king dobromil .
so you think that's funny , eh?
no one's laughing .
no?
too bad !
business goes better with a smile .
well , mr. joker , tell me how much wood you brought .
four cords .
four? that is a good joke !
what do you expect for that?
to wipe the slate clean .
and what deeds have you done?
i burned the neighbors 'barn .
so what?
that's just fine .
but i feel sorry about it .
what?? !
sorry?? !
i'm confiscating your wood .
get lost !
next !
ten cords of hard oak .
that's better .
and what do you want for it?
my mother in law in hell .
kindly allow us to decide who we accommodate .
all you get is ... goat turds !
i won't let you cheat me !
oh , yes , you will .
you took a business risk ...
want your house burned down?
who's got anything else to sell?
i have some black pine .
and where's it from?
king lumr's land .
well , well ...
so there's something still growing there?
i see you're working hard here , too .
we're doing our best .
so where's the wood?
that raft there .
two measly cords .
you get ... a jackal's paw .
that's worth a fortune in hell .
thanks .
it's just what i wanted .
i've got something else for you .
what's that?
a toothpick of black pine .
a toothpick?
what's it good for?
for picking out food stuck in your teeth .
yesterday we roasted a ram and i got something ...
i can't get it out .
the devil take it !
how much?
30 ducats : too rich for your blood .
are you joking?
azarakh has whatever he wants .
the little bugger's out !
what do i do with it now?
nothing .
you can pitch it .
well , that wasn't such a good deal .
you're a pretty good con man .
maybe you'd like to work for us .
gladly .
get up !
i said get up !
do you hear me?
you mangy ass !
i'm gonna break your stinking legs !
get up !
move or i'll ...
this is driving me crazy .
okay ...
okay ...
i'll skin you alive .
and the devils will make drums of your hide .
you'll drum in hell ...
i brought you some helpers .
got any work for them?
yeah , plenty ; , but so what?
i've got nothing to eat .
i'll pay you twice as much .
i'd rather cut off my tongue !
alright .
okay ...
just stop it .
well , i guess there's nothing .
maybe next time .
i was thinking more of something in hell .
don't be so eager , my boy .
all in good time .
all in good time .
everyone's time will come .
where's he going?
that leads nowhere .
why'd you refuse the extra pay?
pay?
he'd only give me lucifer's stinky old boots .
licking one clean was plenty !
why do you do it then?
i've gotta do something .
and at least i've got security .
i hunt some , feed the family ...
what's with the knife?
i'm gonna skin this beast .
he refuses to work .
let him live .
i'll buy him .
ducats !
ducats !
i'm rich !
i don't think so .
you're the same bootlicker you were before .
come on , donkey , you're coming with us .
man , we were rolling in clover !
let's just go .
i had a house and fireplace , but now i've only ashes ,
when it's gone it's simply gone , all we have soon passes .
i had a cart of sturdy oak , my oxen left me too ,
when it's gone it's simply gone , no sense feeling blue .
okay , here you are .
sausage ...
headcheese ...
good lord !
save yourself if you can .
i had honey , i had bread , now i've not a crumb ,
when it's gone it's simply gone , whatever comes will come .
i had a warm and cozy coat , now i've not a flea ,
off they go , now they're gone , and i'm feeling free .
what's here is here , what's not is not ,
water flows on its way and rocks are all we've got .
halt !
the king's proclaimed a new tax !
three ducats per adult and one per child .
let's get on with it !
you heard him .
pay up !
pay up !
i won't !
oh yes , you will !
beat him !
what?
that's what .
beat him !
take that !
you won't pay , eh?
apollonia , thanks for the herbs ; here's your oil and cloth .
okay , you fiddling hack ...
two adult and two kids .
8 ducats .
i'm happy to pay .
but why only four?
what about my pup?
doesn't he have a soul?
he's one of god's creatures .
sure is .
i'll pay for him too .
great .
are you mad? all our money?
all of it? no way !
we've still got our nest egg .
come on out , ducats !
i bet it was stuffy in there .
ten ducats ...
a few extra so the king can live it up a bit .
i'll see that he gets them .
that fine man deserves them .
deserves them? !
are you nuts?
we sold everything .
are you trying to make beggars of us?
i know who's behind this !
i'll get you , you witch !
me?
make fools of honest people !
what did you do to him , you witch? !
no !
you witch !
you put weeds under his hat .
what's going on , crazy woman?
put me down !
you know i will , you wretch .
good day , madam daisy .
wait ...
are you talking to me , an old woman?
you're the prettiest garden i've ever met .
good gracious , my vision !
that's him .
and he's got an ass .
annie , he's here !
he's here !
he's come !
who?
our rescuer !
the one from my dream .
and you know what he called me?
daisy !
wasn't he supposed to call me that?
well ...
prophesy is never so clear cut .
but he's got a donkey .
i still have shoes !
my very best shoes .
didn't we overdo it a bit?
perhaps a bit .
certainly someone needs them more than me .
get a grip on yourself !
robbing paupers ...
aren't you ashamed?
don't spoil my fun , sniveler !
so you want to have fun , eh?
come and play !
how ... how dare you?? !
what are you waiting for?
seize him !
that'll teach you .
give it to him good !
let him have it !
he's had enough .
am i in heaven?
sorry to disappoint you , but i'm not your guardian angel .
don't move ; , just lie still .
does something hurt?
my heart .
i think i'm dying .
that's a lovely handkerchief .
they kicked you in the head .
you'd better come and let annie and i treat you .
are you satisfied?
we're flat broke !
what's going on? why do you look so thunderstruck?
hey , kids , dad's back !
daddy !
it seems that we , king dobromil the good , are aging rather fast .
dogs age seven times faster and make not a peep of complaint .
what a flatterer you are .
why should i flatter you when you don't pay me?
aren't you exaggerating?
it's so good to be home , sire .
don't let him spoil it .
it was a garden here when we left .
and now?
don't you smell the stench?
if you don't like it here pack your things and go .
don't say that a second time ...
what would i pack anyway?
there's not even a pot to pee in around here .
give me a ducat and i'll be off .
got one?
here .
this king had what it takes .
it's not a real ducat anyway .
oh well ...
have a nice time , majesty .
farewell .
if you're annie , you're the only thing here worth envying .
annie , is it you?
incredible !
you really are old enough to marry .
but you deserve a spanking for gallivanting around so .
where's the jester going?
nowhere ...
he just came back to see his daughter .
who'd have thought ... that the people still had so much money?
me .
but we needn't tell the king .
get a move on !
heave !
i am .
you little ducats don't want to , but you have to .
jump !
how much longer must we slave?
oh , please !
i've got to bleed the people dry .
but relax ...
we'll be repaid a thousandfold .
next batch ...
ready?
sure .
come on , ducats .
come on .
i'm coming .
think the king suspects us?
stop creating devils out of nothing .
he's harmless as a lamb .
he's eating out of my hand .
toss them in .
the gate's closing ; in you go !
kiss your goosey .
no , no , no !
did you say goosey?
how about roasting one?
oh , no !
oh , yes .
the oven's hot and i'm a bit peckish .
get a move on !
keep working !
hold up !
good work .
the minister will be satisfied .
looking good with that crown !
what's this? !
what's going on here?
they're rebelling .
each sinner has to drink a stein of swill .
hot swill .
drink up , boys .
what?? !
drink it down .
swill , eh?
it's beer !
dark beer .
and well chilled .
so our sinners can live it up .
i'll give you " live it up , " you idiot !
to lucifer , now !
so you felt sorry for the sinners?
yeah .
it's hot , right?
nothing's better than a cold one when it's hot , eh? lovely !
i even have a hammock to rock them in .
and i sing them lullabies ...
that's a great idea .
and i have something for you too .
a sweet candy ... for my sweet little dove .
get this into your thick head : goodness is treacherous .
but evil is exciting , intoxicating , even elevating .
take him away .
he's the sixth this week .
what's going on?
it's apollonia's flowers , what else?
no wonder they're so messed up .
apollonia , my dear , stick you tongue in your ear .
nice rhyme , eh?
excellent execution !
so stick it out .
my tongue?
taste good?
this isn't funny anymore .
why is dobromil's kingdom still afloat , eh?
i don't understand it .
i want him here !
king dobromil the good ...
we've got to speed things up a bit .
excellent .
goosey kissy ...
what the matter?
don't we like it?
greetings , friend .
enchant , madam .
why are you here , boss?
sit , scoundrel .
why insult him , sir?
that's no insult , madam .
that's his title .
i was in the neighborhood and thought i'd drop in on a friend to find out how the case stands .
when can i bring the contract?
the contract?
concerning the contract ...
the king's still not ready .
he's got to stew in his own poverty a bit longer .
it's dragging on too long .
i'm doing what i can .
the king hinders my every move .
guess what he thought up now?
he wants to marry annie off .
that's not good .
that's bad .
a rich husband might screw up our plans .
i should punish you .
me?
what about the gold i've sent down to you?
watch ...
a ducat .
i put it in the pitcher ...
take it out .
i ...
i can't .
you can .
this is some of your magic .
no magic .
drop the coin and your hand is free .
you see? you've got to make a sacrifice to save your skin .
don't worry about any suitors .
i'll think of something .
hey , look who's come for a visit !
i thought that beating made me hallucinate .
it's you who's apollonia's hallucination .
you've made yourselves at home .
maybe i was waiting for you .
such a great match , philip and his wench ...
whoa , you beast !
see , you shouldn't bully that animal ; it's sacred .
what are you two doing?
must i do everything myself?
guido , go chop some wood .
show me you're good for something .
you live somewhere nearby?
on a farm?
at the castle .
at the castle?
so you serve at the castle .
it seems like i serve here at apollonia's .
has anyone ever told you you were pretty?
no ...
actually , yes .
the king's jester .
annie , you're pretty ... ugly .
you're a real apothecary .
it comes in handy sometimes .
careful , that's nightshade .
it's poisonous .
you used this to make that man crazy?
i wanted to make him good , and i made him an idiot .
here's cherry tarts and berry juice .
let me take that .
i like it here , but i need good work ...
work that's well paid .
it won't be easy to find work .
what are you good at?
i know a lot about ... just about everything .
we need someone like that .
and you?
me?
i can fight a bit , but not much else .
fighting isn't bad , and you've got the donkey too .
i'd accept a position at the castle .
but i won't be a servant .
of course .
maybe the king himself will find you something .
annie will put in a good word .
i don't need any wench's help .
i've got to go .
wait ; will we meet again?
that's up to you .
you know where to find me .
don't worry ; we'll visit .
what's that?
devils come for my flowers .
we paid 30 ducats for that ass .
for the rest i'll remember you in my prayers .
philip !
if you stick these herbs under someone's hat they become stupid but good .
they might come in handy .
come on !
before someone gets our jobs .
thanks for everything , apollonia .
and we're alone again .
let's go get some water .
come , mira , let's water the garden .
what are you whining about?
what?
what's going on?
scoundrels !
enough of your shenanigans ; i need water !
damnation , apollonia , don't make me angry .
not enough for your stinking herbs? just say what you want .
want pearls? you've got them .
pitch them to your swine !
i don't have that many .
beat it , you bat .
impressive , eh? i can even do a triple flip with a half twist .
stop bugging me .
i'm watering .
insufferable flowers .
i'd scorch them with brimstone .
cut the swagger , mr. wheeler dealer .
i'm pure as a lily and you're powerless here .
look who's swaggering now .
even you'll end up as my guest .
beat it !
hey , look ...
we need a cook , but not just anyone .
show me what you can do .
i'm supposed to concoct a meal from slops?
cut the jokes , friend .
you're cooking for the king .
this is for the king?
it's fit for pigs .
the minister will haze you if it doesn't pass muster .
i'm not joking .
you wanted to speak to the king?
come on then .
don't worry , we'll manage .
we'll add ... a lot of garlic .
it'll turn out , you'll see .
let's light the oven .
well ...
what are you good for?
majesty , maybe i could be your advisor .
and what could you advise me about?
to be honest ...
i'm good at everything ... as far as i know .
okay , then ...
tell me what you'd do if people were fleeing the realm .
fleeing?
i'd flee too ...
on a horse ...
to catch up with them ... and bring them to their senses .
my kingdom for a horse !
your majesty , this is philip .
he's applying as head cook .
oh , is he really?
let's give it a try .
don't risk it , majesty ; it was made from our own stores .
this one is a dangerous criminal bent on poisoning you .
it smells wonderful !
garlicky .
it's excellent !
i name you head cook .
what about me , majesty?
you?
a good question ...
i think you'll fit in perfectly here .
you're my new jester .
put it on .
you come with me .
it suits him , eh , daughter?
that's your daughter?
last i heard .
are you a devil?
who?
you .
me?
no !
no?
too bad .
you have that hellish fire in your eyes .
i can feel it .
well , boys , one of you will return among the living to sue for the princess 'hand .
you know princess annie?
little goat tootsy .
aha , my nephew urugal ...
you'd like to marry annie , eh?
little goat tootsy .
but he ... he ... he wasn't selected .
no?
such a handsome buck?
as you wish ...
annie's going to marry one of you .
and that's how we'll knock the king for a loop .
who'll volunteer?
what about you , urugal?
not interested?
i am .
but i don't get it ...
do i go after annie?
or do i start by knocking the king for a loop?
you understand perfectly .
sure i do .
marry annie and knock the king for a loop .
i choose you , urugal .
and you ...
get lost !
you're a deep thinker .
true .
how will you get her?
i'll give her this to suck on .
then annie's footsies will follow me like ...
iittle goat tootsies .
excellent .
that's right .
my father's looking for a husband for me .
i thought you already had one .
cut it out .
let's leave here .
you want to run away with me?
you know nothing about me .
i know everything .
really?
who am i then?
you're my dream .
and apollonia conjured you up .
she ate some mushrooms and you appeared to her .
the donkey , too , right?
exactly .
can i tickle you?
sure .
feel anything?
nothing .
wait ...
i feel it ...
it's really nice .
oh , you !
it doesn't tickle?
you're supposed to laugh .
i feel more like crying .
you'll soon be married ...
so let's run away .
that won't help .
you don't want to go with me .
you don't really want me .
you're like these flowers .
so beautiful ... it hurts my eyes .
then we must protect them .
prince , you're like manna from heaven !
i know .
lucifer chose me himself .
i came for annie .
here i am !
catch me , annie !
run , run !
come on !
philip?
i can hear you ...
are you here?
annie !
here i am !
wait !
now it's your turn .
no ... oh , yes it is .
follow me !
watch the steps !
that's cheating .
sometimes cheating is best .
oh , really?
hey , you'll pay for that !
i'd rather be enjoying a warm bath .
present arms !
prince laguru of the east !
let's stoke this fire a bit, eh?
prince , the king's there .
i'll present this to him .
hi there .
a gift from the prince .
thank you .
coal?
it's not coal .
it's lava .
what do i do with it?
i use it to scrub my heels .
this is your gift?
you've got nothing else?
diamonds ...
hey , bring that here .
got any more?
coming out our ears .
prince laguru ...
what brings you here?
it's like this ...
i ... uh ... want the princess ... uh ... as my wife ...
and i'm gonna knock your majesty for a loop .
majesty ... the prince is from a land near mongolia .
it's their custom that ... that ... that the groom must fight the father for his bride .
as they say , he has to knock him for a loop .
if we must fight ...
i'm sure it isn't necessary .
i don't care , but where's the ... pr ... pr ... princess?
hi there !
your majesty , apparently she's dressing .
she wants to look her best .
what do you want?
annie's fooling around with the cook in the bath .
annie was seen in your steam bath with the cook .
what?? !
just look at us .
hold on ...
wring it out .
anne !
what are you doing? !
is that annie footsy goaty tootsy?
that drowned rat?
that's how you greet your future husband?
must she greet this lagoon , or whatever his name is?
majesty , he's a prince .
prince or no , take these and get out !
what am i , like , supposed to do now?
start looking elsewhere .
i don't ever want to see you with that cook again .
that's youth , eh?
you'll catch cold , princess .
hey , i had this for annie .
what do i do with it now?
for annie , eh? give it here .
that's not for you !
get over here .
give me a kiss .
i don't want a kiss and i don't want you !
of course you do .
get back here !
can i come in?
you can do whatever you want .
or so it seems .
watch your mouth !
you know i want what's best for you .
so you locked me up?
it's for your own good .
i'm ashamed of you .
to let your realm be plundered like this .
no one respects you anymore .
but i wasn't even here .
exactly .
can hear us , king?
we're packing up ; and if you're wise you'll do the same .
someone's ruining this place .
beat it !
get lost , scum !
you say no one respects me anymore .
maybe someone still does .
we are , after all , of royal blood .
i think it's time i met a certain someone ...
son of a gun !
what a waste .
what have you got there?
nothing , majesty .
why are you lying?
the devil knows why .
tell lucifer to come .
it's time i met him .
you know the spanish boot?
a cruel instrument .
nails pierce the foot ...
blood spurts forth ...
hell fire !
this little thing is far more humane .
the so called spanish thimble .
we gently and carefully place the thumb inside ...
and voila !
it becomes an inkwell full of royal blood .
majesty , the time is now ripe .
give me your soul and i'll shower your realm ... with riches .
your signature , please .
just a moment .
we'll wait for midnight to strike .
i have a weakness for theatricality .
the clock has struck .
please be so kind , majesty , as to endorse this parchment , this document of documents , with your royal signature in blood .
life is beautiful , so enjoy it .
i'm coming for you in a year .
guido !
i've got to get out of here .
give this to annie .
it's important .
and tell her i love her , and that she should wait for me .
count on me .
thanks .
lucifer , wait !
what do you want?
to work for you .
hurry up .
you wanted a job so no goofing off .
show me what you rustled up .
what matters most is how it tastes .
the sauce is great .
what's in it?
i can't even remember ...
cranberries and hot peppers .
oh ho !
sweet and hot , like the carrot and the stick !
i use that too when necessary .
okay , you've sold me .
for a year then?
it needn't be in your own blood yet .
put it there .
what happened to them?
they sold me their souls .
lifeless bodies lost in oblivion .
and that's the greatest punishment , eh ... for you of noble birth?
your father , isn't it?
you are philip , son of king lumr , are you not?
i know all about you .
you too will end like this one day .
i'll get you .
and what if i get you?
think you can dupe me?
laughable , but interesting .
i'd happily play for your soul .
if you 'get me , 'as you say , i'll return your father's soul .
of course , if you fail during the year of your service , you'll keep me company for all eternity .
not a bad offer , eh?
not bad .
don't worry , we'll grow on each other .
now , down to business ...
forgive me , philip , for hurting you .
i never wanted to hurt anybody !
the times are so strange .
just tell me what to do and i'll do it .
thanks , apollonia !
it worked !
i've got you !
i can't believe it worked .
yes , you've got me , philip .
do you take me for a fool !
i'm not got so easily , my boy .
it's just grass .
guido exchanged it on you .
now get lost !
and no more games !
where's the food? !
finally .
can't you move any slower?
give it here .
it took forever .
what is this crap?
where's the cook?
i'll shove this slop down his throat !
bring him to me .
we've sought him in vain .
he's vanished into thin air .
guido , where's philip?
where else?
he found a job with better pay .
that's a lie .
don't ask me then if you think i'm lying .
didn't he leave me a note?
nothing .
he just disappeared .
move .
did you send him away?
no .
why would i?
but maybe it's for the best .
you'll never see me again .
what a morning , huh?
let's cheer things up ...
can you explain this?
don't recognize yourself , eh?
you did it all for this?
guards , seize him !
so that's how it is .
if i'm going to hell you're coming with me .
what are you waiting for?
seize him !
against your own king?
you'll pay for this .
that's right ...
out of the realm's coffers .
this can't be happening !
take the old man as well .
we're cleaning up around here .
and find the princess so everything's in order !
guard them carefully !
don't let them step one foot out of the castle .
you !
got anything to say about that coin?
throw him behind bars !
come on , you clown !
what's happening ...?
stop !
where are you going?
did they hurt you?
such brutes have no feelings .
he's just a big oaf .
leave him to me .
i'll teach him his manners .
he's yours .
get this : if guido tells you to cut off my hand then you'll cut off my hand .
oh , man , have i got an idea !
i'll give you the royal seal .
you'd like that , eh?
i don't really need it .
why not?
i've got a present for you too .
do you like it?
a lot .
now go visit the king because he must be lonely .
the king ...
i'm going to see the king !
guard them well .
all of them !
philip !
philip !
excuse me , did you take anyone across last night?
my philip?
finally .
this is where you are .
mira , find annie .
annie !
how could you do this to me?
i've had a devil of a time .
are you listening?
what are you doing here?
i'm scared about philip .
i'm sure something's happened to him .
otherwise he'd have already found me .
can you believe it?
first he says he loves me ; then he leaves without a word .
philip knows what he's doing .
love must sometimes stand aside .
easy to say for someone who spent her whole life with herbs .
what could you know of love?
you think i know nothing?
listen here .
i've been in love .
a love that burned even in the coldest winter .
but it wasn't meant to be , and when he left me my love was still so strong that i drowned myself in tears .
who was it?
who?
your father .
my father?
but he married my mother .
sure , she was rich and noble so he married her .
just like that !
a lovely spot , eh?
we also came here .
love in winter grows here .
come here ...
philip will return , you'll see .
finally .
what is it?
jackal's paw a la honey .
looks great .
get lost !
i forgot to tell you ... my dear philip , that everything here lives and dies by my hand .
so only i can destroy king dobromil's dear little contract .
everything moves towards it's end .
except me of course .
forgive me , father ...
why do you want to destroy us?
that's just like you .
always blaming someone else .
you destroy yourselves .
i just watch with my fingers crossed .
but with your traits you play right into my hands .
it won't be long now .
hell fire !
mira !
where are you , mira?
apollonia will have to look for us again .
come here , mira .
come on !
hey , you little rascal .
let's pick the herbs and get home .
still sulking?
i'd like to make you ... a proposition .
marry me .
you and i ... get married?
have you lost your mind?
the throne will soon be vacant .
it could be ours to share .
since when do jesters barter the royal throne?
it's royal no longer .
the king sold lucifer his soul .
how dare you say that !
you liar !
he's got few days left to live .
marry me or you'll never see your father again .
everything here is mine anyway .
not me .
it's just a matter of time .
there's still philip .
yeah? where?
forget about him .
he's lucifer's eager servant .
you lie .
i'm flying !
we'll be angels soon .
i'm light as a feather .
but you feel like a ton .
you're making me swing .
you're flying too .
something fell from above .
another angel i suppose .
who are you?
get your hands off me !
don't worry .
we love the world .
yesterday we were rolling in apollonia's clover .
pure bliss !
now we're angels ... almost .
wanna try it?
how do i find lucifer?
lucifer?
he can't stand angels .
but if he's who you want , keep heading straight on .
urugal !
help me , uncle !
ah , what delicate flower do we have here?
she wants to speak to you , sir .
i see you've moved up in the world .
i've made the best of things .
what do you want?
do you know anything about annie?
you mean the princess?
what is she to me?
it's as if she vanished .
i'd like to speak to the king .
why not?
apollonia !
what are you doing here?
i'm not here to reminisce ...
i'm looking for annie .
she was with me ... then she disappeared .
i'm afraid for her .
my annie is gone and only fear remains .
dobromil , i don't recognize you .
it's a mess here , just like your whole kingdom .
did you come to reproach me?
i can do nothing more .
yes ...
so i heard .
you wanted to marry annie to a rich man .
you'd just ruin her life , like you ruined ours .
your refined combinations send me into raptures .
not for much longer : my year is almost up .
almost up? let's have a look ...
you signed on for ten years .
what?
lucifer , get up here !
seems like she wants something .
i'm telling you to get up here !
another bucket of diamonds ...?
i'll be back in a flash .
i've got a deal for you .
well , spill it .
i'm all ears .
cancel the contract with the king ... and i'll give you my garden .
you can do whatever you want with it .
too late .
i don't care about your herbs anymore .
soon enough not even thistles will grow here .
come , my lovely flower .
let me go !
you wanted to see lucifer , so come on !
annie !
what are you doing here?
i should ask you the same .
oh , come now , kids .
what a pleasant surprise !
i trust i'm not interrupting .
came to say hi? i can't praise philip's services too much .
but he just did something a little stupid .
you stole something out of my pocket .
but why?
to help king dobromil? no !
to save his own precious cowardly skin .
it wasn't for 10 years !
it was just a scrap of parchment .
you walked into my trap .
you see? now i've got you .
golly , boss , you're brilliant .
get her out of here .
it's not her time yet .
where're your shoes?
i gave them to guido for a unicorn .
a unicorn?
yeah .
where is it?
it was in the sky this morning , then it vanished .
the devil take it !
he won't drive me crazy .
i have some news of annie .
what ...? annie?
what is it?
where's your unicorn?
you'll get no more clouds from me .
tell me about annie .
i heard she's in danger .
danger?
what danger? speak !
i don't know ...
i said i just heard about it .
find her .
i'll give you anything you want .
i already have everything .
but maybe there is something .
if i find her will you agree to our marriage?
bring her .
i want to see her again .
majesty , the clock has struck midnight and i have come with my faithful servant .
the hour has struck ... just as i struck the coins that now fill your treasury .
don't ruin this for me .
i like this part the best .
as i said , the hour has struck .
here is the parchment signed in your blood .
come with me , please .
just a moment , master .
before the king goes to hell
i'd like him to fulfill his promise .
he must give me his daughter's hand in marriage .
i had no choice , annie .
i had to see you again .
all very touching , but i've got a document here , so let's go .
lucifer?
shouldn't you read it first?
you think so?
well okay ...
i ...
philip the cook , will faithfully serve lucifer ...
what is the meaning of this?
that's that fake scrap of parchment , remember?
my year of faithful service .
where's the king's ... signed in blood?
you burned it .
destroyed it by your own hand .
get it? the king is free .
he's not yours anymore !
the king is free .
he's not yours anymore !
the princess is getting married !
and not to just anyone .
but to our savior prince philip !
hey , you left without us !
don't worry .
i'll come back for you .
strike !
lift !
strike !
lift !
no more !
enough !
will you lick those boots, guido?
or won't you lick those boots?
always flitting about , eh , annie?
to our children's happiness ; how about it , lumr?
and to your health , dobromil .
and to weathering that terrible storm .
i myself feel like a young man , full of energy .
he's trying to amuse us !
it's a barrel of laughs here .
i guess i'll gather my old knights for a noble conquest .
why not stay here and put your realm in order?
to our savior's happiness .
hey there , my daisy annie !
hi !
is it another vision?
oh , that's the end !
if you relish lard , the fat , and the rind ,
if you only snoop and never seek to find ,
if you balance accounts as you fall asleep ,
if you count money instead of sheep ,
and still expect to strum in heaven's dell ,
you'll end up drumming hide in hell .
if it gives you pleasure to make a scene ,
if you always speak but nothing mean ,
if you'd sell your soul for a bit of gold ,
if you think you're wise because you're old ,
and still expect to strum in heaven's dell ,
you'll end up drumming hide in hell .
ignore the devils skulking in the bush ,
they can't answer , when shove comes to push ,
why the world makes you sigh ,
they just say , the devil knows why .
if you slink around from door to door ,
if you hide goat tootsies beneath the floor ,
if your mind is nothing more than farts ,
if you laugh when someone breaks his heart ,
and still expect to strum in heaven's dell ,
you'll end up drumming hide in hell .
ignore the devils skulking in the bush ,
they can't answer , when shove comes to push ,
why the world makes you sigh ,
they just say , the devil knows why ..
