you're my best friend , and i just need to get a picture of you .

it's almost too nice to go in there , you think?
yeah , let's go back .
i was talking to judy yesterday .
yeah?
she was telling me about the huge order they have coming in , which means we're really gonna have to pump up production .
that's great .
that's what i thought .
we're already doing too much as it is .
i think so too .
they need to get some more help .
what do you think?
yeah .
so you think tonight maybe you can give me a ride to my other job at the shovel factory?
you know i will .
yeah .
i always told you if you ever needed a ride or anything , all you had to do was ask .
i appreciate it .
no problem .
you been out on a date lately?
no , not for a while .
no prospects , huh?
no .
i've been busy working pretty much .
i leave here and i only got so much time before i have to go to the other job , so ...
it's about like the rest of us , i'm telling you .
plus i gotta work nights , so if i want to go out at night ,
i can't do that , unless i have a day off , so
i'm ready for the beaches .
yeah?
yeah .
i want to go to aruba .
oh , yeah?
i saw that on tv the other day .
the beaches are great .
i think i'm about done .
how about you?
yeah .
i'm gonna go and smoke .
you talk to your dad lately?
um , no , not since the last time .
it's probably ... six months ago .
where's he at now?
last i heard he was living in arizona , i think , and , uh , i guess he got remarried to someone .
i haven't heard from him since .

nearly 22, 000 baby boomers in west virginia have no health insurance as they near retirement .

hi .
hey .
how's work?
it was all right .
how are you?
i'm all right .
you hungry?
uh , no , i don't think so .
i'm just gonna go to bed .
all right .
good night .
good night .
you ready for your first day?
oh , yeah .
not nervous or anything?
no .
i'm fine .
okay , that's great .
so tell me again , do you have airbrush experience?
yeah .
i used to airbrush t shirts at the mall .
great .
when you were doing that , were you working with other airbrushers , or were you just waiting on the customers?
no .
i just worked by myself .
they would bring me what i needed , bring me the orders , and i would take care of it .
okay , well , that's really good .
we'll see what happens .
good morning , everybody .
i know you guys are all aware of the big order that we've got in , and we've been working hard to get it done , but we feel like you guys need some help .
and so here she is .
her name is rose .
we were very fortunate to find rose in the fact that she has airbrush experience .
she's worked with stencils before , so she'll be working in the head painting area .
i'm sure she'll have questions throughout the day , so please help her .
i found rose , when we were interviewing her , to be very sweet and the consummate team player , so i think she'll fit in really well with our workforce here .
so i'll let you guys introduce her through the course of the day , and , um , please help her out with anything that she needs .
get to work .
you know you got to double glue those before you put 'em in the box , right?
yes , i'm aware of that .
so do either of you smoke?
i don't .
yeah , i smoke .
do you?
mm hmm .
well , when you're done , if you want to , we can go grab a cigarette .
sure .
okay .
where did you used to work?
i used to work at a nursing home .
and what'd you do there?
i was a professional ass wiper .
you know , the bottom , the cna .
the one that everybody comes to when something dirty needs done is basically what i did .
i took care of people , the people who can't do for themselves anymore , you have to do everything that they can't do : shower them , dress them , feed them .
just depends on who you have , what you have to do .
it's a hard job that you really , really have to be dedicated to .
you really have to like what you're doing or you just can't .
'cause there's , like , days you go in there and it's just
you just want to turn around and walk out , it's that bad .
this isn't as hard of work , but ...
i don't think i'm gonna like this much better .
and what about you?
what was the question?
where did you work before you came here?
i used to work maintenance in an old factory .
that's cool .
mmm .
i'm very ready to get out of this area .
why is that?
'cause there's nothing here .
mm hmm .
i'm living in this little apartment with my daughter .
she's two .
you can't make money in this area .
it's just poor .
everything's poor .
are you married?
no , i'm not married .
i thought i would be , but things don't always work out like you think they're going to .
you know .
just another bad decision .
yeah .
what are you doing right after work today?
well , i probably have to ... get home and see my dad .
do you think you might be able to give me a ride?
i don't see why not .
i have another job that i have to be at like right after , but it's not that far from here .
okay .
i'd really appreciate it .
no problem .
are you about done?
yeah , think so .
i guess we're gonna go have a cigarette , and we'll see you back up there in a little bit .
okay .
ready?
rose?
where are you?
i'm in the bathroom .
oh , my god , rose !
what are you doing?
i'm taking a bath .
do you do this all the time?
no , not all the time .
remember when i told you i worked in a nursing home?
i sure did .
i got hit in the back with a tray table by this little old man .
and it messed up my back .
i couldn't pick jesse up for like a month .
but every once in a while my muscles will contract , and i get really sore .
and this feels really good .
and my apartment has no bathtub .
it just has a shower , so i take advantage .
but i clean it when i'm done .
i clean after i bathe .
okay .
i was kind of wondering .
i didn't know what would happen if we'd get caught .
no .
she won't be here for a long time .
oh , my gosh !
i mean , every room was the size of my whole living room .
the bedrooms
you could fit my whole house in two rooms in that house .
i could not believe it .
gorgeous !
chandeliers coming down out of the ceiling .
it was unreal .
hmm .
i mean , just fabulous , fabulous , fabulous .
and then ... you are not gonna believe this .
she tells me how particular this lady is .
and then she invites me inside of this house that she's cleaning .
guess what .
she was in the jacuzzi bathtub
i am not kidding taking a bath .
she was supposed to be cleaning it?
yes !
got sidetracked .
i'm not kidding .
i couldn't believe it .
i thought i was gonna die .
all i could think about was that lady coming home and catching
you know , here i am , not supposed to be there , in there checking her house out , and there's rose in the tub .
and you know , i thought , " wow .
yeah , i'd be afraid of 'em just coming home too early .
i'm not too sure about her .
yeah?
what do you think?
i don't know .
she seems fine to me .
you think so?
yeah .
she scares me a little .
hmm .
i was working at a restaurant , and they work day and night .
turn two different shifts .
i just didn't have anybody to care for him .
it was really rough , and i didn't want to have to put him in a nursing home .
the expense for that is huge .
yeah , those places
and you don't want to do that unless you absolutely have to .
oh , really?
yeah .
because a lot of times they're understaffed or they don't have all the equipment that they need .
you know , you get people in there that shouldn't be there , that should be in other facilities , that are violent .
you know , you just , you never know what you're gonna get .
you don't know who they're gonna put in the room with 'em .
you know , because it's not ...
the way that they put people together is not necessarily by what their sickness may be ,
like , you know , put two stroke patients in the same room .
some people might be bedridden , and some people might be up walking around .
and they get into each other's things and tear stuff up .
oh , wow .
yeah .
glad i didn't do that .
no .
and as far as , like , management , they're so tight that what they'll do is take
you know , you might clock out , but if they see you walking across the parking lot , they'll be like , " can you come just for a minute and come help with this or that?
and you end up staying over an hour or better .
and that happens three or four days a week .
so you don't even get paid .
but you need your job , so what do you say?
yeah .
you're kind of st
you don't want to make anybody mad , you know .
and they do it to everybody .
oh , really?
so everybody kind of just did it , you know?
wow .
i can't imagine them doing that here .
we're gonna make quota and get some of that bonus .
did you guys hear about that?
no , i haven't heard anything .
yeah , we're gonna get probably about $50 if we meet quota at the end of the week .
i thought that was great .
that's awfully nice of 'em .
yeah , that'll help me out a lot with bills and things .
that's what you'd spend it on if you got it?
i probably will just
i don't know .
i haven't really thought about it .
what do you think you'll spend yours on?
i don't know .
if the weather keeps getting nice ,
i'll get camping equipment or something like that .
oh , that sounds like fun .
mm hmm .
well , if you're looking to make a little bit of extra money ,
i was wanting to go out this weekend .
if you want to baby sit jesse for a few hours ,
i couldn't pay a whole lot , but i could give you a little bit .
what night?
friday night .
if that would work out for you .
sure .
i think i could do that for you .
could you?
yeah .
she's really good .
how old is she?
she's two .
okay .
it'll be nice for her too , 'cause it'll give her somebody else to be around .
she doesn't she's not around too many other people .
what's she like to do?
she likes to color and she likes to read books .
okay .
yeah , and she goes to bed at 8 : 00 , so more than likely
that's great , 'cause that way i can sew after
oh , yeah .
that's good , that's good .
okay , no problem .
great .
i'm excited now .
are you about done?
yeah , pretty much .
wanna have a smoke?
sure .
now , you know i probably won't be home till about 11 : 00 , and i left a number hanging on the refrigerator if you need me .
i was wondering if you left me a number .
yeah , i sure did .
if i need to get ahold of you .
yes , i did .
so she should be going to bed in about a half an hour , usually about 8 : 00 .
about 15 minutes before you put her to bed , just give her a few goldfish crackers and some juice , just enough to put something in her stomach .
but she should be all right .
she may cry whenever i leave .
just kind of expect it .
okay .
all you have to do is lay her down and just read her a book , and she'll get her blanket , suck her thumb and she'll be done .
all right .
that sounds great .
she's pretty easy .
hey , sweetie , what do you have there?
who's here?
who's here?
watch out .
hey , come in .
hey , come in .
hello .
come here , sweetie .
who's the man?

oh , nothing .

and , uh , who's driving?
i am .
i borrowed a i borrowed a car off my friend .
oh .
he let me take it out tonight .
i see .
can i have a kiss?
mommy's gonna go for a little bit .
are you gonna be okay?
no !
yes , you will .
i want my baby !
okay , you get your baby .
i guess we're gonna go and  okay .
what's that?
it's another baby .
you can take that baby and go night night with it .
love you .
mama , i wanna go with you .
no .
you're gonna stay here with martha .
yeah .
you're gonna have fun .
come here , sweetie .
no !
we'll read a story .
would you like to read a story?
no !
i see a really nice book .
look !
she's got a book . and she's gonna read to you .
no !
i'll be back in a little bit .
here , give me a kiss .
no !
i want to go that way !
you might want to get her now .
i go that way !
come here , sweetie .
no !
do you want to play with some toys?
no !
well , come on .
no !
oh , sweetie .
yeah , but seriously , it seems like every time i think i'm saving a little bit , getting a little bit ahead , something comes up .
jesse gets sick .
yeah .
have you been able to save much?
a little bit .
i don't have a checking account or anything , but ...
i got drawer change i've been saving .
drawer change , huh?
yeah .
yeah , he's got his own place , and then jesse and i live together .
yeah , he wasn't ready for our baby .
he's an artist , and he's very into his work and what's going on with him .
he doesn't have time , you know , for anybody else .
but he helps out with her .
he baby sits while i work sometimes , if he has time , or whatever .
that's good .
at least he sticks around a little bit and sees her .
yeah .
he makes an effort .
so did you finish high school?
no .
actually , i had anxiety , and i ended up quitting .
what is that?
oh , just when i got around a lot of people , you know ,
i'd get a little bit nervous and sometimes i'd have a panic attack .
really?
yeah .
it was pretty bad , enough to quit .
did you go to a doctor or anything for that?
um ...
yeah , i did at one point , but they just kept prescribing me pills that didn't work , so i eventually just quit going and dealt with it myself , you know?
there's not much you can do about it , so
are you taking anything right now?
no .
no?
and how do you do?
does that bother you anymore?
it's not as bad now , you know .
usually , the places i go , there's not 400 people like school .
yeah .
it's usually when there's a lot of people .
lately , it's only temporary when it's bad .
mm hmm .
did you finish high school?
no , i didn't finish .
what happened there?
i got rebellious in high school .
oh , yeah?
oh , yeah .
yeah , i ran away , hitchhiked to charleston .
yeah .
how old were you then?
fifteen .
kind of dangerous , isn't it?
yeah , a little bit .
it was fun at the time .
yeah?
yeah .
and look now .
i'd like to save up and get a car .
oh , yeah .
that's nice to have .
yeah .
so where do you live?
i live with my mom right now .
oh , really?
yeah .
it's just a matter of money , really .
trying to save up .
it's the easiest way to do it .
yeah , i hear you .
is your mom home right now?
well , actually , i don't know .
well , would you rather just like maybe go back there where there's not so many people?
well , i guess we could , yeah .
okay .
those are very pretty .
your mom must like jewelry .
yeah .
look at that .
it's pretty .
yeah .
oh , we lost it .
it's a giraffe .
a giraffe .

hi .
kyle told me about you .
oh , really?
yeah , he did .
so how do you like it there?
it's pretty good .
it's not too bad .
it's busy but , you know , it's a job .
yeah , jobs really get that way .
you guys wanna watch this?
it's pretty good .

i think we're just gonna go hang out in the bedroom for a little bit .
okay .
all right .
okay .

bye .
this is a pretty interesting room you have .
what's that picture of?
that's a tattoo .
my friend drew it for me there .
he does tattoos and stuff .
that is crazy looking .
yeah , it's pretty cool .
i like it .
do you have any tattoos?
yeah , i got two tattoos on my arm here .
no kidding .
are they exactly the same?
yeah .
they're symmetrical .
that's cool .
are you gonna get any more?
yeah , i'll probably end up getting up to about here or so .
he'll probably come up with something good i can put on .
a friend of mine in marietta did one on my back .
oh , yeah?
yeah .
i'm not ready for another one though .
did it hurt or anything?
no , it didn't hurt .
i'm just , i don't know what else i want that's like forever .
yeah .
you know .
oh , yeah .
it's definitely permanent .
oh , yeah .
do you like hanging out in tattoo shops?
yeah .
i got a couple friends that are tattoo artists .
yeah , it is fun .
you meet a lot of people .
yeah .
wow .
that's a nice watch .
where'd you get that?
thank you .
it was a gift from someone .
i used to clean their house .
oh , yeah?
kind of like a tip?
yeah , like a big thank you .
that's nice of them .
yeah , it was very nice of them .
i see you've got a lot of high times stuff .
do you smoke?
yeah , i'm a smoker .
oh , yeah?
i figured .
yeah , i'm a smoker .
would your mom get mad if we smoked in here?
um , i think i can make it so she won't know .
yeah .
i just don't want her prying in .
right , yeah .
yeah , i think we can get away with it .
that's cool .
do you , uh , want a drink or anything?
you know , that would be good .
do you have any beer?
yeah , i got a beer .
i'll be right back .
thank you very much .
mm hmm .
oh , man .
what?
it's starting to get kind of late .
i'm gonna have to get back to jesse .
i told martha we'd only be a few hours , but ...
i'll just let you have this , and you can save it for another time or later , whatever .
okay .
i'm sure i'll save it for another time .
we can hang out and drink a beer , and then we're gonna have to take off .
all right , that's cool .
so i don't think i wanna go back in there because of martha and all .
what about martha?
i don't know .
she gave me a weird vibe when i was in there earlier
like she was mad at me or something .
for going out with me?
i don't know .
it could be anything .
she just gave me a weird vibe when i was in there earlier .
okay , that's fine .
i did have fun with you though .
yeah , i did too .
definitely have to do it again .
well , just , you know , get ahold of me .
yeah , all right .
i'll see you at work monday .
okay .

oh , it was all right .
i really wish you guys would've told me .

well , you could've told
i felt like an idiot .
oh , i'm sorry .

jesse was great .

did you have a good time with her?
yeah .
she really likes those necklaces .
yeah , she does .
she's something .
sure is .
she went to bed about like what you said .
had her juice and her crackers and went up to bed .
hey , guess what .
hey .
guess what happened at my house .
what do you want?
uh , a little bit of money , a bag of herb ... and the truth .
that's about it .
i don't know what you're talking about .
okay , cool .
exactly .
what?
all the shit that's missing from my house .
where the fuck is it?
i was out .
i wasn't at your house .
yeah , i noticed .
he's cute .
he is none of your business .
okay , then take his money .
don't come in my house , in my face  then don't come in my house !
i didn't go in your house and take your shit , okay?
i don't have anything of yours .
you have my car , that you like to drive around town , that you're so happy with .
i need the damn car , okay?
you don't think i need it?
i take jesse around , i take her out shopping , buying her fucking happy meals , all that good shit .
but i can't do it without my damn money .
i don't have your money .
okay
i don't have your fucking money , jake !
it's not here .
you can look around .
there's no money .
i have no money , and i have no weed .
you're childish .
you are such a fucking baby .
it's all about jake .
what jake wants , what jake needs .
i don't have your shit !
i need my money .
go sell some of your shit and make some money .
it's the stupid principle !
principle of what?
you coming into my house , banging on my door late at night , accusing me of shit?
you need to pick my shit off the floor .
pick it up and give me my money .
unless you spent it all .
at least did you spend it on jesse?
huh?
did did you buy her some clothes?
get out of my house .
oh , excuse me .
was that jesse's daddy?
you know what?
martha , please , just mind your own business , okay?
read your book .
hello , sergeant .
detective taylor .
sgt. davis .
what do we got?
we got a phone call at 6 : 45 from a neighbor stating that a child had been crying all night long .
she couldn't get anybody to answer the door , so she called 911 .
we responded , made entry .
once inside , we found a 23 year old female on the living room floor by the name of rose hilliard .
okay .
any sign of forced entry?
no sign .
any sign of robbery?
doesn't appear to be .
what about a struggle?
appears to be a struggle , yes .
let's go and take a look .
okay .
dad , i've got your breakfast .
well , how nice of you .
what are we having , cereal this morning?
yeah .
cereal and some juice .
well , you're right , sarge .
there's no sign of forced entry into the apartment .
doesn't look like a robbery .
her valuables and her purse are still here .
she's got bruising to the neck , which is consistent with manual strangulation .
she's got petechiae hemorrhage of the eyes .
where's the baby?
baby's with the grandmother .
so the baby's safe?
yes .
ross , when you're doing the fingerprints ,
i want you to process the bruising on her neck for prints .
okay , sir .
what did we find out from the neighborhood canvass?
officer smeeks?
you wanna fill the detective in on what you know?
okay .
now , i spoke to three of the neighbors .
hey , mom , you didn't happen to pick up any money in my room , did you?
no , i didn't .
i haven't been in your room .
didn't see in your room .
all right .
maybe you spent more than you thought you did .
i had a little bit saved up , so i might have misplaced it or something .
i was checking if you were in there and picked it up .
no , haven't been in there .
haven't seen it .
was it a lot of money?
no , just a little i had saved up for an emergency .
this is a ring that my mother had given me .
when i turned 30 , she said i'd be responsible enough to take care of it .
okay , so it's pretty sentimental , huh?
yeah , it is , and this is my grandmother's broach , and that was handed down through the family , and my mother thought she had gotten that , but i got it .
you'll never guess where this came from .
where's that?
i found this in the park with a metal detector .
oh , wow .
nice find .
i thought that was pretty good .
jake?
i'm det .
taylor from the police department .
i need to talk to you for a minute .
can i come in?
uh , is it necessary?
it's kind of important .
it's about rose hilliard .
i need to talk to you about her .
all right , man .
come on in .
right through this door .
did you do this on the walls?
yeah , yeah , most of it .
very interesting .
some would say .
how long have you known rose?
oh , man , i've known her for a while , like ...
we were together for at least a year and a half .
probably altogether , i guess five years , somewhere around there .
okay .
i guess you share a child together?
yeah .
what's your daughter's name?
jesse .
okay .
so when was the last time you saw rose?
oh , man .
uh ....
what day is today?
saturday .
uh , just last night .
so it was last night you were over there?
yeah , yeah , friday night .
do you remember about what time that was?
like 11 something .
it was later , man , like she was coming from a date .
why did you go over there?
because , man , she's ignorant , and she stole money of mine .
did you get to talk to her?
yeah , i talked to her .
was there anybody else there at the house when you were there?
uh , i remember she had some chick on the couch .
do you know who that person was?
no , not a clue .
okay .
what did she look like?
uh , looked like a person on a couch , man .
i don't know .
so you didn't pay much attention to her?
no , man .
okay .
did you confront rose about her taking money from you?
hell yeah .
did you get into an argument?
uh ...
i don't know .
that's just kind of how we talk nowadays .
just tell me  yeah , yeah , man !
she took my money .
i wanted my money back .
okay .
she wasn't about to give it to me , or just even give me satisfaction of admitting she did it .
did you guys get into a screaming match?
no , man .
the kid was sleeping upstairs .
so what happened?
uh ...
we ...
i went in and asked her , " where's my money?

she said , " get the hell out of my house , " and i left .
do you have any idea why i'm here?
no , man .
rose was murdered .
whoa .
okay .
do you have any knowledge about who did that?
no , not me .
i know that much .
from looking around your apartment , i can tell you're a very passionate individual .
artistic and passionate .
not passionate to beat her ass or anything , otherwise you probably would've heard of me a long time ago .
you've never been physical with her in the past?
no , man , not really .
so when you left , she was alive and everything was fine?
well , i wouldn't say everything was fine , but she seemed to breathe and speak and move about .
so while you were there , you didn't get into any kind of physical altercation with her .
no , man !
so you're she's dead?
she's dead .
wow , man .
wow .
i need i need to call some people , man .
i need to see my daughter .
the darker the water , the darker the bait , which doesn't make any sense at all , but if the water you're going to be fishing in is real clear , you'll want the lighter colors . ... for the spinner rates , and they lock down .
and then there's little boxes that you can put whatever you please .

i've been trying to get ahold of you .
i've been out all day .
i went to the beauty parlor and went and bought a couple things .
has anybody talked to you yet?
about what?
about rose .
what about rose?
she was killed last night .
she was murdered last night .
she was strangled .
no .
yes .
last night?
yeah .
oh , my god .
there was a detective here today .
you have got to be kidding me .
yeah .
he just came in today and told us .
he asked me a bunch of questions .
and this happened last night .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah , they were asking me because they thought i was the last one that seen her .
then i told him you were  well , you brought her home when i was there .
yeah .
you are not gonna believe this .
when i was there last night after you dropped her off , this guy started beating on the door , and she goes to the door and she opens it up , and he comes in .
he came in screaming and yelling .
she was okay when you left .
i mean , she was by herself .
she was fine , yeah .
when i left , she was fine .
but if he was waiting out there when you dropped her off , he was probably waiting on me to leave .
yeah .
and he went back in there .
oh , my god .
i can't even imagine .
i know .
it happened too fast .
i know .
well , i got these for you .
oh , well , thank you .
thank you , martha .
you're quite welcome .
yeah , definitely , you have to call this detective too .
oh , i will .
you'll have to give me the number .
hi .
how you doin '?
hello , martha .
i'm det .
taylor from the police department .
i need to talk to you about rose hilliard .
can i come in?
oh , sure .
come on in .
i heard from kyle today , and he was telling me that something horrible had happened to rose , that she'd been murdered .
can i come in and have a seat?
sure .
this is my father .
sir , i'm from the police department .
i was just here to talk to your daughter .
pleased to meet you .
pleased to meet you , sir .
i mean , at first i thought she was a really sweet girl .
and then the longer you get to know her , the pushier she gets and the more favors she asks for .
i mean , it was just one favor right after the other one .
did you feel like she took advantage of you?
a little bit , yeah .
did she do that to other people?
i'm not really sure .
it seemed like she picked on me a lot .
she didn't really buddy up with the other employees .
she'd only been there a week .
well , in talking with the witnesses in the area , they indicate that you were the last one that was seen leaving the residence .
well , i i know that
well , i i don't know .
i probably was .
i left after he did .
and that fact that , as far as the investigation is concerned , you were the last one that we know that saw her alive .
okay .
at some point , i would like to get fingerprints from you to be able to compare to evidence that we collected at the scene .
well , you know my fingerprints are gonna be there .
i was there .
right , but there's other evidence that we have
that would only be the killer's .
okay .
would you be willing to come to the police department tonight and give me a set of fingerprints?
okay .
i would have to get someone to take care of my dad .
and about how long will that take?
shouldn't take more than 15 , 20 minutes
to get the fingerprints .
okay .
if you'd be able to do it tonight , it'd really help with the investigation .
i'll do anything i can to help .
hello , martha .
detective .
thanks for meeting with me again .
i just got a few more questions that we need to talk about ,
if that's okay .
okay .
do you care if i record our conversation?
no .
okay .
i'll just go ahead and start the tape .
what i like for you to do is go over the events again with me of friday night .
do you remember about what time kyle came to the house?
no , i don't .
okay .
did kyle come inside?
yes , he did .
and did he stay very long?
no .
they , uh ...
they talked a little bit , and , um ...
they weren't there very long .
do you know where they went?
no , i don't .
okay , so when they left , it was just you and the small child .
yes .
and what did you do that evening?
the child and i just played , and then i watched some tv and read some books and gave her some juice , and she went right to sleep .
rose had told me that it wouldn't take her very long , and she was very good .
okay .
nothing unusual happened then?
no .
what time did rose come home?
it was close to 11 : 00 .
okay , and did you immediately leave or
no .
when she came in , we sat down and she asked me how jesse was , and i asked her about her date .
and , uh ...
then , of course , that man came to the door .
yeah , you told me that an individual came .
yes .
it was her ex boyfriend?
right .
he had been
i guess he had been sitting outside waiting on her .
and did they argue?
yes , they sure did .
you told me that they had gotten into an argument .
again , tell me what that was about .
he had said that she had stole some things from the apartment and some money .
how did it end with them?
did it turn physical?
well , there was a lot of yelling and ...
i'm not sure whether he shoved her , but i know she had grabbed ahold of him to try to get him out the door .
was she able to get him out of the house?
it took awhile .
okay .
but he did ultimately leave the apartment .
yes .
yes , he did .
did you see him any more that night?
no .
i didn't
i just got in my car and left .
okay , and where did you go when you left?
i went straight home .
okay .
and i spoke to your dad the night that we talked , and he said you came home about the same time that you're saying .
um ...
is there anything else that you can tell me at this point?
well , the thing that , you know , really bothers me is that he was waiting outside on her to get home .
uh huh .
so what if he was still there after i left?
okay .
do you remember when we talked at your house and you indicated to me that you'd do anything you could to help with this investigation?
yes , i did .
well , what you need to do is start telling me the truth about what happened .
so i am .
we have got the physical evidence back from the lab , and it implicates you in the death of rose hilliard .
i don't see how .
how?
your fingerprints were lifted off the bruises around her neck .
i don't understand it .
now , martha , this is the opportunity for you to help yourself here .
now , either you are a cold blooded killer ,
which i don't think is the case ...
no . or something happened in that apartment that caused you to do this .
there is no doubt that you did this .
none .
but only you can explain to me what happened , and i want you to do that .
i can't .
i just i don't know .
is there any way that you can explain your fingerprints around her neck?
no , sir .
no , sir .
and the neighbors saw you leave the apartment .
you were the last one to leave the apartment .
the evidence is there .
you will be convicted of this .
you need to tell me the truth about what happened .
i don't know .
i i don't know .
well , the jury's not going to believe that .
i want you to look at these photographs .
that what she looks like .
that's what you did you her .
a jury's not gonna have sympathy for you if you don't show some kind of remorse .
now , it can be explained how this happened .
maybe you got into an argument with her , maybe things got out of hand .
but only you know that .
she can't tell us .
i couldn't have done this .
well , you did .
no , sir .
no .
no .
mr. hightower , i wanted to come over and talk to you and let you know what's going on .
okay .
i was wondering about it .
i just finished talking with martha , and based upon my interview with her and evidence that we recovered from the scene , she's been arrested for the murder of rose hilliard .
is that right?
and i wanted to come over and make you aware of what's going on because you are her family .
yes .
she's currently at the jail and that's where she'll be until there's a hearing date .
what the hell .
sorry to hear it .
do you have any questions for me?
do you know when her hearing will be?
it'll be fairly soon .
and they will give her an attorney .
hey , martha .
hi , kyle .
i'm really glad you came .
it's horrible in here .
yeah?
so what's going on?
i don't know .
i don't understand .
i don't even know why i'm here , really .
and they think i killed her .
kyle , you know me .
you know i could not have done that .
i think i really i think it's jesse's dad .
and i can't i don't know .
i don't know what happened .
you got to help me , kyle .
you know that i would never do anything like this .
yeah .
i i don't understand .
and it seemed like the detective
they think that i did this , and i don't see how .
i don't see how that can be right .
i don't know , martha .
i don't understand it .
i don't know .
i don't know what , you know , what i did .
i know that i had a really , really , really bad headache , and when he started yelling , i just wanted to go home .
and i didn't know who he was , and when i tried to ask her who he was , she told me to mind my own business .
and that kind of made me feel bad because , i thought , you know , i thought i could talk to her like a daughter .
i mean , after all , she left me with , you know , her most prized possession : her baby .
yeah .
and she's asked me for all kinds of favors , and i just didn't think it was too much to ask who he was .
and she was really mad and didn't want to talk about it .
i don't know , martha .
you got to help me , kyle .
you got to .
i mean , i don't what i can do , but ...
i ...
i don't know how this happened .
we have to figure this out .
we have to .
i didn't do it , kyle .
you know i wouldn't do anything like that .
yeah .
i don't know , martha .
i just i don't understand .
i don't either .
good morning , everyone .
we've obviously gone through a very tragic set of events .
it is , um ...
but we need move on , and because of that , we have gone out and we have hired kyle's mom , helen , with the idea that
she can't take the two ladies 'place because they are , you know
we had a longtime employee and we had a short time employee who was doing very well , but we feel like with , um
even though kyle's mom doesn't have a lot experience , that you guys can work with her , get her up to speed just as soon as possible .
hi .
you show me what to do .
i'll do the best i can .
help you out .
oh , my god .
