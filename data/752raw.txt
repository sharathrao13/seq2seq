what's your problem?
all i've ever wanted ... was to get away from this dreadful place .
and home to my dear , sweet mother .
but blast it all ...
peter stole my treasure , and my men would mutiny ... if i so much as tried to leave without it .
so here i am .
stuck in this absurd place .

huh , you got that right .
i guess we're in the same boat .
the same boat !
that's it !
w what's it?
i'll give you passage home on my ship ... and you can help me recover my treasure .
oh , don't you see?
the treasure's useless to peter .
he's not sensible like you and i.
he's just a boy who'll never grow up .
hmm .
tell me about it .
hook : and , really , what other choice do you have?
it's not as though you could fly home .
hmm , well , i suppose .
if it is rightfully yours .
and if it's really no use to peter ...
splendid , splendid !
wait !
hmm?
you must swear not to harm peter .
me?
actually harm peter pan?
perish the thought .
i shan't harm him .
you have my word .
i , captain james hook ...
do hereby swear ...
not to harm a single hair on peter pan's head .
hook : y : ou see?
leave the light on , mommy ... your baby boy's coming home .
now , when you've located the treasure ... just give this a wee toot .
i'm your only way home .

do you believe in magic
in a young girl's heart
how the music can free her
whenever it starts
and it's magic
if the music can move you
and hold you so tight
that it never can lose you
y : our feet start tappin '
and you can't seem to find
if it's really real
or just a state of mind
if you believe in magic
just close those big eyes
and think all the wonderful thoughts that arise
and maybe
if you dream it just right
y : our toes will be over the treetops tonight
and you'll be flyln '
and from there you can see
how the magic's in you
that the magic's in me
if you believe in magic
come along with me
we'll dance until morning
till it's just you and me
and maybe
if the music is right
i'll meet you tomorrow so late at night
and we'll go dancln ', baby , then you'll see
how the magic's in music
and the music's in me
believe in the magic of a young glrl's soul
believe in the magic of rock and roll
believe in the magic that can set you free

i am not a child now
i can take care of myself
i mustn't let them down , now
mustn't let them see me cry
i'm fine
i'm fine
i'm too tired to listen
i'm too old to believe
all these childish stories
there is no such thing as faith
and trust
and pixie dust
i try
but it's so hard to believe
i try
but i can't see what you see
i try
i try
i try
my whole world is changing
i don't know where to turn
i can't leave you waiting
but i can't stay and watch the city burn
mmm , watch it burn
'cause i try
but it's so hard to believe
i try
but i can't see what you see
i try
i try
i try and try to understand
the distance in between
the love i feel and the things i fear
and every single dream
i can finally see it
now i have to believe
all those precious stories
all the world is made of faith
and trust
and pixie dust
so i'll try
'cause i finally believe
i'll try
'cause i can see what you see
i'll try
i'll try
i will try
i'll try
to fly
