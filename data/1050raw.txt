justice never tasted so sweet ... ... as in the bench .
i didn't do it .
i'm innocent .

no , you're out of order !
i object to the way my client has been treated .
i object that i've let my professional judgment ... ... become clouded by my feelings for her .
i object to the way the room spins when she walks in .
i object , your honor , because i love this woman .

dr. martin !
america's sweethearts .
god , they were great .

they were on top of the world .
then she blew it by dating that spaniard .
did you cut this?
no , chad in marketing
always take credit .
that is survival rule number one .
okay , i did it on my mac .
don't take credit until someone says they like it .
it's not bad .
i hope this isn't too awkward for you .
i'll never fill your shoes .
i know .
kingman's in the screening room .
he wants you to see something right away .
please remind mr. kingman that he fired me last week .
and then invite him to kiss my undercarriage .
you'll want to see this , lee .
hello , dave .
lee .
thanks for coming .
why am i here?
i'm just confused .
you did fire me last week , so why am i here?
to see the new weidmann film .
really?
eddie and gwen's last movie .
you've seen it?
all of it?
how is it?
would you roll that , please?
be the first to see what only i have seen .
as a friend .
something wrong?
did the film break?
the film is fine .
at least , i think it's fine .
wherever it is .
i spent 86 million dollars ... ... of the studio's money ... ... on 20 seconds ... ... of titles .
that's all he sent .
the titles !
and a note .
dave , we could also do these in blue .
we had to make a weidmann film !
he has three oscars .
he's a genius .
seor wences !
lipstick , hair and his hand !
he had an 85 year career !
do you remember?
huh?
all right?
don't talk to me about genius .
remember the nut in the woods?
ted kaczynski .
the guy at fox?
the unabomber .
remember he lived in that cabin?
so?
hal weidmann bought that cabin from the government ... ... and moved it onto his property .
that is where he edits his movies .
that is his little , twisted ... ... sicko office .
it's him .
on the phone .
who?
hal .
i'll kill him !
that sick son of a bitch bastard .
put him on the speaker .
hi , hal .
how are you , darling?
you're in my thoughts .
i want to send you a basket .
how's the film?
finding its way .
could it find its way here?
we have a few things to do , like finish it .
it's finished , dave .
great .
how is it?
my mother thinks it's my best work .
can i speak with her?
no , dave .
can someone pick it up?
no , dave .
you haven't commented on the titles .
i love them .
i have no notes .
when's the press junket?
weekend of the 21 st .
why?
i want the press to see it first . we'll experience it together at thejunket .
i'm the head of the studio .
i don't experience things with the press .
i'm hanging up now .
wait !
wait !
give me that .
hello?
god ... ... damn it !
we can't see it before the press !
at the junket?
at the junket !
lee , you have got to do this junket for me .
set up a junket for a film you're not sure you'll have?
yes .
no !
don't make me beg .
you already are .
lee , please .
please , come on .
lee?
danny can handle it .
no .
danny cannot handle it .
it's his first junket .
i need the master .
you're a legend at working the press .
i want to stay a living legend .
lf not for me , do it for my father .
you worked together a long time .
you bonded .
he was psychotic .
you spoke at his funeral .
i loved him .
you , i can't stand .
do this for me .
please .
the studio's going under !
no hit in two years !
it may be the last eddie and gwen movie , and i can't get my hands on it !
what do you want?
i'll tell you what i want .
lf people think eddie and gwen are reunited , they'll see the film .
make it happen .
that'll be easy .
make it look like it could happen .
she has a restraining order against him .
he's in some mountaintop nut hut .
i don't care !
i need eddie and gwen back together again , smiling and happy !
we can sell it .
and the spaniard?
unless i get a script called i schtupped castro , i don't know .
so what do you want?
i want the golf cart .
no , it was a gift from arnold .
i'm kidding .
i can have anything?
yeah .
within reason .
i want my job back .
don't do this  have a good junket .
keep me posted .
all right .
yes .
you get them back together , you can have your job .
where are we booked?
four seasons .
no .
book us in the middle of nowhere , where they can't escape .
we need a hotel like the one in the shining .
the new hyatt in nevada?
it's in the desert .
book it .
we have to keep the press entertained .
let the press think it's about them , not the movie .
give them a lot to do : parties , hayrides , circle jerks .
help them forget they haven't seen the movie .
what about gifts?
the movie's about a cop traveling in time , so i did a gun .
you're giving press members a gun?
it's not real
we'll do a bag .
call the bag man .
diamond earrings , money clips , chocolate truffles , perfume .
i don't want this to be awkward for you , but i've got work to do .
how will you get eddie and gwen there?
i know somebody .
i love you .
i'd do anything for you .
you're just asking an awful lot .
a junket with eddie isn't gwen's priority .
take the lilies out .
yes .
i understand .
excuse me .
could you please put that out?
gwen would love this .
i can't take unsolicited material .
just warning you it'll be a bit of a fight .
i'll do what i can .
god help us .
when we come back from the break , you know the scenario .
i've been here before .
look right at that camera .
talk right to the caller .
right down the tube .
okay , five seconds .
let's go to the calls on larry king live .
you're on the air with gwen harrison .
hi , larry .
gwen , hi .
i used to be a big fan ... ... but i'm sorry , i can't get over what happened with you and eddie .
i can't sleep at night .
how can you?
well ....
you sleep next to a very handsome young spanish gentleman , don't you?
let's go to our next call .
rock lsland , illinois , hello .
gwen , i saw yourlatest movie .
thank you .
i couldn't sit through it . without eddie , it's not the same .
this has to be hard .
your last two movies without eddie ... ... tanked at the box office .
they were big in europe and huge in japan , actually .
still , it must be tough .
two duds in a row ... ... lots of intrigue , whispers , talk .
what happens if this one tanks?
i hate larry king .
why did i do his stupid show?
just breathe .
i don't want to breathe .
your last two movies tanked .
i wanted to choke him to death with those stupid suspenders .
everyone hates me .
that's not true .
the lighting was great .
everybody said you looked great .
who?
you looked great .
see?
thanks .
as if she really knows .
water will make you feel better .
i only like the water with the electrolytes .
larry said you were amazing .
thank you .
i love larry .
let's love him down to the dressing room .
black or white?
white .
and those glasses !
who wears frames that big anymore?
he looks like a bug .
i just want this week to be over .
why can't the world accept that i don't want to be with eddie?
get a life !
i want this week to be over . ls it?
almost .
push .
kiki !
i'm sorry .
i smell smoke . ls somebody smoking?
i don't know .
it's probably larry .
how many heart attacks has he had?
six?
maybe seven?
can we just go?
i don't want to be here anymore .
those are beautiful .
okay .
i got a call from lee today .
who?
the studio's publicist?
remember?
you got upset when letterman didn't air your show due to the gulf war .
he was there with the english toffee .
i remember the toffee .
great toffee .
we'll get you some when you meet with him to talk about the junket .
oh , god .
do i have to?
meet with him?
yes , you have to .
it's not fair .
all this pressure on me and none on eddie .
he's probably having a ball .
this letter is a very important part of healing .
writing your mom gives you the opportunity to thank her ... ... or forgive her or ask her why she did what she did .
we don't mail it .
but the act of putting it on paper frees you .
allows you to let go .
now , what did you say to your mother?
fuck you .
okay .
we'll try the letter some other time .
are you comfortable speaking about gwen?
think i should?
there's no " should .
think i can?
what is " can "?
all right .
there was this place in chinatown .
tiny little place .
they wouldn't bother us there .
we'd get wonton soup and crumpled duck and sit there for hours , talking .
she took him there .
she took him to our crumpled duck .
i followed them and i saw him pouring the soup and smiling ....
it was a total accident .
she told the press i tried to kill her .
that's crazy .
she loves to overreact .
we have a saying , edward .
what is that?
bean salad?
what does that mean?
i don't know what it means .
it's very old .
i'm making progress .
i feel more secure .
a lot more secure .
do i seem more secure?
you look great .
whatever they're doing , it's working .
your face has color .
i'm in love .
they say two weeks here changes your life .
when are two weeks up?
six months ago .
but i'm getting close to something .
i can see that .
did you watch larry king last night?
i was in the isolation tank .
the reason i bring it up is gwen was on .
she took kind of a beating .
she did , did she?
you , young lady , are nobody without eddie !
nobody likes you !
never go anywhere without eddie .
you're nothing .
you're nothing !
get her out of here now !
nothing !
i'm so sorry , larry .
i guess she got what she deserved .
why are you here?
kiss gandhi goodbye , and let's get ready for the junket .
i'm not going !
i'm not ready .
the studio and the movie need you .
i don't care about the movie .
how is it?
good?
i've only seen the beginning , but it's fantastic .
hold it up to your ear , you'll scream " oscar .
no , i'm not going .
gwen'll be there .
you want to see her?
no .
it's too soon .
it's a year and a half .
get it over with .
she fell in love with another guy .
it happens .
never to me , but if it did , i wouldn't hide like some pussy !
i'm not a pussy .
i'm still getting treatment .
this is serious stuff .
my wellness guide won't let me just go .
you can go .
you sure?
you just said i was a flower in a stream , but a branch blocks my way .
you read too much into my words .
listen to your heart .
i'm the flower .
i wanna stay .
you're funny .
we'll miss you .
don't forget to be grateful .
i'm grateful .
i'm grateful for the sun . for the stars in the sky
i'd be grateful if we could go .
why don't you wait in the car?
okay .
i am the flower .
i'm the flower .
he kills me with his humor .
does he?
i want to thank you for all your help .
you'll get the car in 1 0 days .
convertible .
leather interior , fully loaded .
he'll get through this okay , right?
life is a cookie .
i'll take that as a " yes .
okay .
all right .
come on , eddie !
all right , buddy .
ready to go?
here we go .
does gwen know i'm coming?
it was her idea .
absolutely .
she's really excited .
not in a million years .
lf that demented pig is there , no way .
eddie was temporarily insane .
don't stick up for him .
kiki , look at you .
hi , lee .
how are you?
good .
you look fabulous .
thanks .
what did you do? ls it your hair?
it's my hair and a little sun .
she lost 60 pounds .
and i lost a little weight .
i see that .
you look terrific .
sixty pounds !
that's a backstreet boy .
right?
are you here to talk to me?
of course .
i'm sorry .
eddie's not demented .
it was a one time , forgive and forget thing .
he tried to kill me .
am i the only one who remembers that?
attempted murder doesn't get attention anymore?
he was just so in love with you that he flipped out .
you have this powerful effect on people .
that's true .
you sticking up for him again?
whose side am i on?
gwen , your dog just swallowed your window washer .
puppy .
your puppy's a raptor .
prozac time .
excuse me .
she's on prozac?
lf only .
the dog .
oh , the dog .
that's not a bad thing .
hey , baby .
hi , honey .
here comes your sweaty big man .
you're sweaty .
who is this?
i'm lee , press agent for time over time .
i'm not gonna sweep her off her feet .
no , you're too old .
hector , honey .
be good .
i'm sorry .
he's spanish .
no problem .
i was spanish once myself .
oh , i need kisses .
oh , honey .
oh , there you go .
oh , yes .
oh , yes .
for why is he here now?
he wants me to go to the junket for the movie .
we could do that .
when?
we won't take up any of your valuable time .
i'm not invited?
it's the studio's decision .
what do i care about the studio?
i don't give a shit .
i go where gwen goes .
we're a couple .
we'll go to the junket together .
studio .
you're so beautiful .
i love you so much .
i wanna marry you and make something with our skins .
we're not going .
eddie'll be there .
we won't go because of him?
listen .
we're going to go ... ... and i'll personally protect you ... ... if that psycho asshole bastard tries to kill you again .
we're not going .
don't argue with me .
we're going .
everybody wants me to go , but nobody cares what i want !
that's not true .
nobody cares !
don't you know the stress i have?
everyone hates me .
everyone wants a piece of me .
my shrink's out of town .
i wasn't nominated for a golden globe this year !
leave me alone .
bastards .
are you pleased with yourself?
i can't even enjoy my shower now , mr. publicist piece of shit .
gwen is totally nuts .
cleared the room .
well done .
talk to your sister .
at least she pretends to listen to you .
where is she?
grazing .
nazi bastard .
just kidding .
you need to go to this junket .
why not?
i'm afraid .
of ...?
that i'll see eddie and he'll be a mess .
i'll feel guilty .
and i'm tired of feeling guilty .
i know .
i'm always thinking about other people .
i know you are .
i hate being the only one who cares about others .
lf they see eddie down and sad , they'll pity him and blame me .
so what you're worried about is you .
of course .
does everyone hate me , kiki?
no one hates you .
yes , they do .
i was in that great store on melrose .
there was a baby in a stroller looking at me , and he was judging me .
the whole world is judging me for what i did to eddie .
look , i'll admit ... ... the miss adorable image has been called into question .
all the more reason to go .
smile nice with eddie for the weekend , win back audience goodwill .
you think it would help?
i do .
i could give eddie the divorce papers .
that's a plus .
you sure you're ready to do that?
i'm sure .
why are you still questioning me?
it's eddie .
he'd sing " yellow submarine " at the top of his lungs to make you laugh ... ... and save the mango in his fruit salad for you .
exactly .
eddie .
you're just a romantic , kiki .
you know nothing about married life .
you got me there .
i won't be able to get through this on my own .
can you help me?
i'll help you .
these are new pants .
good dog .
get the paper .
come on .
come on .
please .
help .
don't let me interrupt .
what happened?
i'm packing her things because we're going to a junket .
really?
great !
you're a great sister .
i'm a great assistant .
to the left .
these are herbal medications .
okay .
people wrote i was on zoloft , but this is holistic .
sure got a lot .
watch the road , please .
bobby?
he wants you to pull over .
this is kishtonga root .
yeah , okay .
why are we stopping?
i was told to .
so how you doing?
fine .
why?
i gotta hand it to you .
lf my lady left me for another guy , i'd swallow a gun .
i'd get drunk ... ... lay on the tracks and wait for a train .
could we please not talk about that?
you know something?
people say i look like you .
not that we look alike .
but i project you .
i project the essence of you , like a you ness .
can you put that partition up?
yes , sir .
how you doing?
how's it going?
i was just getting a pep talk from my driver .
i'm orchestrating the hotel arrival .
should you or gwen pull up first?
where did you come from , man?
here .
i'm riding with gwen .
gwen's back there?
yes .
so do you want to arrive first or second?
second .
be right back .
he wants to go second .
let him .
he can go second .
great .
wait .
he should go first .
i don't want to look like his opening act .
i want to go second .
she wants to go second .
second it is .
she wants to go second .
fine .
let her .
i don't care .
from behind , she'll see the knife she stuck in my back .
thank you .
okay?
second?
we're set .
great .
who cares?
she doesn't care .
yes , i do .
i'm going first .
i don't care !
why is this an issue?
i'm just trying
let's go to the hotel !
you're second .
i don't care !
i don't care !
i don't care !
you're going second .
you're going second .
i don't care .
okay , thank you .
that was easy .
why do we have to go second?
drive the car !
i'm grateful for the sun .
i'm grateful for the moon .
i'm grateful for the cool ... ... cool night breeze .
it's a happy night for eddie and gwen fans .
a year ago , america's sweethearts went bust in dramatic fashion .
here they come now .
hi , gwen , you look wonderful tonight .
can i get a shot?
look this way !
that's it .
gwen , who's a better lover?
okay , right this way .
eddie , here we go .
you look great .
thank you .
what's it like working with gwen?
i can't remember .
that was so good .
that had to feel good .
it was good we went second .
everybody loved you .
what is this?
serenity tea from the wellness center .
i don't know what's in it , but it gets me calm and focused .
i can't do this !
i told you this was a mistake .
she's very close , right?
ln the next room .
i feel her .
no , she's in a cottage in the back .
i sensed it .
she's close .
the cottages are way back on the property .
it's so shocking .
you're with somebody .
you think you'll spend your life she has a cottage and i get a suite?
she has an entourage .
me too !
you do?
i'm a schizo .
i'm my own entourage .
let me move you .
no , it's not important .
i'm grateful for this suite and minibar .
the cottages are probably small .
actually , they're ... ... tiny .
small?
it's ridiculous .
good .
want to get room service?
i'll take some herbs , numb out , have a shower and go to bed alone .
you've been great .
what did i do?
showed up .
that's enough .
rest , i don't want you puffy .
jesus .
hey , steve .
what?
some guy's whacking it near cottage number 4 .
oh , that's ....
that's disgusting .
i don't want to deal with this now .
every time i get this shift , there's always some sicko .
i can't catch a break around here .
sir , i'm sure things are different in l. a ... ... but in nevada , we prosecute public masturbation .
i've been in las vegas  i was not !
we saw you on our cameras .
i was pulling out the prickers !
i'm trying to put out a fire .
i fell into a cactus .
he fell into a cactus .
that's it .
unless you usually arrest those who bump into succulents ... ... l suggest we call it a night .
we still have to fill out a report
listen .
i'm not supposed to do this , but ....
i have beautiful bags that are exclusive for the press .
got girlfriends?
we have real diamond earrings .
beautiful , very tasty .
very delicate .
i saw the bags .
they're nice .
very nice .
the highest quality .
we don't have to file a report .
because i didn't do anything , morons !
diet pills .
usually he's like a pussycat .
all right .
all right?
okay .
thank you , guys .
fellas , one other thing .

danny will go with you to get the tape , all right?
thank you , fellas .

you got me on the edge .
what were you doing there?
i just wanted to see her again .
i saw her standing by the pool , and she looked so fantastic .
i just miss her .
don't give me that look .
i know that look .
it means trouble .
calm down .
go to your room , go to bed and stay out of trouble .
i wasn't getting in trouble !
no , no .
just whacking off on a cactus .
i wasn't !
it looks as ifeddie thomas ... ... may change his name to " peeping " afteran incident at the hyatt .
this tape clearly shows thomas ... ... in the words of one hotel guard , " doing himselfa big favor " ... ... outside his estranged wife's cottage .
oh , my god !
oh , my god .
thomas is in town fora pressjunket for the new eddie and gwen movie .
sources say this latest incident is not surprising ... ... given thomas 'delicate mental state since his split with gwen .
know what the movie's about?
by the looks ofit ... ... we're looking at a remake ofcool hand luke .
it was on the news !
he was outside doing something not good !
gwen , everybody does it .
i know everyone does it .
that's not the point .
what is going on?
ls he trying to kill me again?
with the weapon he had in hand , i doubt it .
people don't kill at hyatts .
other chains , yes .
but the hyatt , no .

nothing national .
they'll issue a retraction tomorrow .
you're fine .

get some rest .
someone has to look handsome tomorrow .
okay , mr. big time?

we talk every day .
we're better friends than ever .
we talk two , three times a day .
we're just cosmically , spiritually bound .
eddie's really good ... ... and he's my pillar of strength .
it's like sodom and gomorrah .
so strong , you know?
and that's five .
ln spite of all the emotion and hurt ... ... we leaned on each other for support .
that's when i realized how strong our friendship really was .
we're in constant contact .

i mean , not only are we great friends ... ... and not only are we in constant contact
you should see our phone bills .

i can't say i'm happy .

and that's five minutes .
thank you so much .
say hi to everybody in salt lake .
good to see you .

just smile and shut up .
you have given me 1 1 0 % today .

i gotta give him the divorce papers .
when?
just before we leave .
what , toss them at him as your limo pulls away?

being nice makes giving him the papers easier , but then he gets hopeful .
ls that your foot?
sorry .

so when you're nice , he thinks  i can't talk about it right now .
it's so hard being someone people just don't get over .

let me have a look .
it doesn't look good .
no?
cold .
what happened?
i needed another humiliating photo op .

this doesn't look good .
what was that?
another stupid thing .
stupid and maybe verging on crazy or ...?
it's a fine ....
there he is .
the master !
i'll have what he's having .
i have to say , you have completely outdone yourself .
ln 24 hours , we've had a walk in the woods ... ... a romantic dinner and a fistfight .
i can't wait to see what happens next .
maybe i can get him to commit suicide .
you like that?
let me think about it .
it won't help initial release but video will go like crazy .
we could do a box like a coffin .
yeah .
that's good .
no , wait .

she wants to talk .
about what?
i don't know , she didn't say .
but i better ...
... go over there .
why didn't you say you'd talk later?
she said she'd come here , and i thought ... ... that's not a good idea so i better go over there , given the situation .
will you tell her about last night?
i don't know .
i'll just let her talk .
know what i mean?
sounds like it's important so i'll let her say it .
then i'll go do these dumb interviews .
i'll come back and we'll lunch together .
does that sound good?
you look terrible .
does it hurt?
only when i'm awake .
he's not here .

i doubt it .
i don't know where that girl is .

yeah , i'm better .
i'm shocking myself .
i forgot how charming you were .

what was that? " what was that?
what movie was that?
i don't know .
what was that movie called?
i don't give a shit !
no , that wasn't it .
you look like you're in a good place .
when i saw you and hector , i was so conflicted .
conflicted is the word du jour .
there's no question about that .
you know what that is?
she's tired .
you seeing anybody?
excuse me?
are you seeing anybody?
let me think about it .
not ....
you know ....
not technically , no .
what?
not technically !
that's fascinating .
not technically .
that's sad .
really , that's a shame .
your eggs , darling sister .
i hope they're runny enough .
and you !
son of a bitch !
here are your eggs !
there you go !
what's wrong?
a lot , actually .
i can't believe it's taken so long to figure out .
i'm going for a long walk to simmer down .
first , i'd like to cut through the shit .
he's not technically dating because he's technically hung up on you .
and you !
you moron !
she's only here to salvage her precious career ... ... and serve you with divorce papers .
i've done all i can do .
i'm going for a walk .
leaving is just something i've really perfected , so ... ... once more , with feeling .
she was more fun when she was fat .
ls that true?
what?
about the papers .
yes , but now i don't know .
seeing you , being in front of the press with you we have something .
maybe i've made a horrible , horrible mistake .
maybe i should give you the papers .
i don't know .
you're the devil .
i want to talk .
hold on a minute .
let go of me .
i want to talk .
i don't !
why not?
you're an idiot .
i'm an idiot too !
ln that respect , we belong together .
it's a complicated situation .
i'll un complicate it !
forget about what happened between us .
it's not gonna work , all right?
last night?
last night was great .
but she calls you , and you can't wait to get to her !
what is that?
it won't work .
you'll probably always think of her ... ... and i'll probably always wonder if you're thinking of her .
i just
i need you to know one thing .
what?
that woman that you saw by the pool
that woman you just have to spend the rest of your life with ....
that was me .
good morning .
morning .
so here's the buffet .
what's going on?
nothing .
i'm great .
just great .
ma'am , can i get some more butter?
when you hit formica , stop .
you know the expression " falling off the wagon "?
but you got 30 pounds of food to break your fall .
what the hell happened?
bad morning .
preceded by 33 bad years .
does this have to do with gwen?
of course not .
i love my sister .
i love everything about her .
kiki?
kiki kins?
who's smoking?
i smell smoke .
ls someone smoking within a six mile radius of me?
stop them , kiki .
oh , ma'am , the butter?
there's no butter?
how can you run out?
i have one theory .
i need an assistant .
lf i had one , she'd be outside milking a cow ... ... and i'd never run out of butter .
my butter has touched another food .
i need new butter .
anything you want .
that's how it goes .
you know .
anything they want , right?
she's got a green dress .
looks like crap on her .
brings out the bags under her eyes .
she gave it to me .
it looks nice .
then she said she wanted it back .
she doesn't want me to have it .
so you're in love with eddie?
wouldn't that be stupid?
i've done every one of their movies .
he never looks at her the way he looks at you .
lf you're in love , just go for it .
the way you went for this breakfast .
not the way you went for the breakfast .
that's
i think i'm gonna be sick .
can you just ....
i'll take all of this to go .
i'll need 30 bags and a forklift .
no laugh , no tip .
i want to play someone like the terminator .
i think the hispanic people are crying out to see ... ... a deadly , destructive killing machine they can embrace .
that they can relate to .
nice to see you .
how are you?
hal here yet?
he's a dead man .
no , i'm serious .
i know a guy .
i'll make a call , and he's dead , because ....
how are you?
hope you're having a good time .
what time is it?

we're doomed .
may i suggest that you follow my lead and get completely shitfaced?
hi , how are you?
you look gorgeous .
hi , mr. k. thank you .
how long must i stay with the people?
they're drunk and touching me .
wait . lf hal doesn't bring the film , they'll be busy building a gallows .
i don't think that's funny .

it came to me like a bus in the street .
or the woman who changes the flowers at our desert house .
i can't talk about this film without weeping .
roll it .
thank you , hal .
have a great time , everybody !
sarah .
i'm ben . we must speak . who are you?
that's unimportant . what's important now is yoursafety .
you're in danger .
this is hard to say , so i'lljust say it .
i'm from the future .
oh , my god !
you look beautiful .
thank you .
come with me now .
now , sarah , please .
love is a bridge built between two people . we want what exists between them to be real .
my name is hal weidmann .
the film you're about to see is time over time , oris it?
the details are unimportant .
simplyput ... ... the script was shit .
i tossed it .
i let my camera capture real life .
just watch .
i filmed my actors without theirknowledge .
i let the camera run after takes .
i placed hidden cameras around .
and the end result is a story ... ... farmore involving than anything manufactured by actors and writers .
this is real life .
thejuice .
the stink .
the glory .
often , you wonder where the budget goes .
shut up !
it's gonna be good .
i don't mean to pressure you , but we're 15 days over .
oh , no . what are we gonna do?
i'm in the middle ofshooting .
it's a sensitive time .
do me a favor .
go away .
please .
never visit my set again .
watch him take it ... ... up the gazoo .
you're an idiot .
i told you we nevershould've hired him .
you're so good in this .
cut .
hal , can i get like three minutes?
three minutes .
gwen , can i talk to you?
i'm working .
what's going on?
nothing .
his hands are all overyourass .
my character would've done that .
you look like a prostitute !
oh , please .
don't make a fool ofme .
cut it out .
i'm watching you every minute .

cut it out .
do you hearme? !
i think eddie knows .

about me and hector .
you said nothing was happening . well , something happened .

what the hell is this?
you think i know?
you bastard !
you see it?
i'll get something .
i slept with him .
hector? .
are you in love?
come on .
it's not always about love .
sometimes youjust need a lay .
i tell you , he's hot .
handsome .
he can go forhours .
just wish he had a bigger , you know , thingy .
i love this movie . what do you mean?
it's like a roll of quarters .
it's like this .
well , maybe like this .
okay .
i know too much .
i'm gonna scream .
i think it's very entertaining .
lee , get over here !
you stop this right now .
i'll sue the studio .
lower your voice .
shut up .
cut the film .
excuse me .
was that deserved?
i think so .
you've ruined me .
you've ruined my career .
look at the screen .
don't you realize what that is?
that's reinvention .
that's birth .
that's life itself .
can't you smell the life?
pretty soon you'll smell lra stern , my attorney !
thank you , hal .
wacko .
the film's new direction caught some of us a little bit off guard .
i am shocked .
i'm outraged .
there are textures !
can i say something , please?
what was said about my penis is completely false .
i'm extremely well hung .
i'll submit to an inspection .
i knew this film would be misunderstood .
kubrick was misunderstood .
godard .
i'll kick your ass !
understand that !
who are you?
who am l?
i'm your ass kicker !
can i defend my dad?
no .
who's her dad?
hal .
no , you cannot !
let me defend hector .
we had sex .
his penis is bigger than a roll of quarters .
you slept with her?
no .
you slept with her?
i swear she's lying .
the part about my penis is true .
it's bigger than coins .
there will be a lawsuit . lnvasion of privacy , damage to my career !
yes , yes , i know .
congratulations .
it's my most honest work .
i'll work with you .
i got a script .
you're great .
i'll send it .
i have an announcement to make .
i'd like to thank you all .
i'm so happy you're here and all our friends in the press ... ... who've been so supportive this last year .
i'm so happy to say ... ... that eddie and i are getting back together .
so thank you all so much .
what is this bullshit now?
be quiet .
this is bullshit .
bullshit !
today , eddie came to the cottage .
we had breakfast and a heartfelt talk , didn't we , honey?
i've wanted to get back together with gwen ... ... ever since we weren't together anymore .
i've obsessed about it .
how sweet .
now that it's happened , i must say ... ... l'm amazed and grateful .
and i agree with hector that it's bullshit .
thank you very much !
we talked about this .
no .
we did .
don't you love me?
we did not .
i love the bright , sexy woman up on screen .
he loves me .
the movie girl .
that's not you .
you're good at pretending to be real .
i think i'm with the real you , but i'm not .
i'm with the real you , not the movie you .
i don't want that .
why?
i just explained it .
you did?
i don't want to talk .
not in front of these  why not?
what could i have to say to you that i don't have to say ... ... in front of 300 international press members .
i'll tell you why .
i'm in love with your sister .
ls this some kind ofjoke?
kiki , could you get over here?
why her?
oh , why not?
ls it so unbelievable that a man could love me?
not now .
now is the time .
you just wait for me !
can i say something?
yes .
no !
listen .
okay , one nut at a time .
you're my sister .
i love you .
you should know nothing happened between me and eddie until last night .
i feel much better about you stealing my husband .
ex husband .
i didn't steal anything .
you're the one shacked up for the past year with ricky ricardo .
look , i am just tired of making excuses .
i am done picking up dirty clothes .
i am done pretending ... ... that your life is my whole life .
i'm just ....
i'm done .
so what you're really worried about is you , right?
well , i guess you're fired .
honey .
you know all i care about is your happiness .
that's sweet
so don't worry about me .
i'll be fine .
you're unbelievable .
shut up .
next?
what can i do for you?
i shouldn't have said that in front of everybody , but
i've been searching for clarity .
all of a sudden i am so clear , it's ridiculous .
i want to be with you .
when did you decide this?
the moment i thought i'd lost you .
damn it .
what?
that was ....
that was good .
no .
no , this is crazy .
eddie , this isn't gonna work .
listen to me .
i'm grateful for you .
ln all the world , the thing i'm most grateful for is you .
lf that's a line from your movie  that one's mine .
what do we do now?
traditionally ... ... we kiss .
give her some room .
thank you .
step back , please .
easy , easy .
i'm on pain medication ... ... that makes me say things i'd never say otherwise .
to set the record perfectly straight ... ... eddie and i never had any plans to reconcile .
and?
and hector is very well endowed .
almost too well endowed .
i've had complaints .
literally .
what are you doing?
packing .
let me help you with that .
that's okay .
that's no , really folding !
let somebody help you for once .
there you are .
that was unbelievable .
like a movie with a stage show .
lf you'd tour with the film , we'd be rich .
and your sister is unbelievable .
the entire country has voted her off the island but , no !
she's back !
i've never seen anything like it .
they like the film !
they call it the blairbitch projecf ! .
but the best news is you two .
want a drink?
we're on our way out .
where?
we don't know .
once in a while , good things happen .
i'll see you .
there's a car , so you can dodge the press .
but i'll need you !
we got work to do !
this one will work !
hi .
can i explain why i didn't call?
