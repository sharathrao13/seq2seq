you sure you don't want a computer at your house?
no .
seems awful strange to me .
a man who made all of his money off of computers doesn't want to have one in his house .
oh !
cool .
cool .
this is fascinating .
supposedly , you can use this to write a mystery novel ... or to solve a complicated crime .
if
don .
you all right?
what?
is something wrong?
well , it's probably nothing .
uh , a love letter from one of your lovely ladies .
something like that .
i'll read it to you .
dear don , sometimes life brings some strange surprises .
it's been almost 20 years since we've seen each other ,
but now there's something i need to tell you .
years ago , after our story ended ,
i discovered i was pregnant .
i decided to go through with the pregnancy , and i had a baby , a son .
your son .
i decided to raise him by myself because our time together ...
had come to a close .
my son is now almost 19 .
he's somewhat shy and secretive , unlike you ,
but a sensitive , wonderful person .
a few days ago he left on a mysterious road trip ,
but i'm almost certain he's searching for his father .
i've told him almost nothing about you ,
but he's resourceful and imaginative .
anyway , if this is , in fact , your correct address , well , i just felt i should let you know .
there's no signature ... and no return address .
hey , congratulations !
you're a father .
uh , you're really upset by this .
c can i see it?
your address is handwritten , but printed .
red ink on pink paper .
typewriter .
<i>a red ribbon .
curious . </ i>
dear don , sometimes "
hmm .
damn .
this postmark is too faint to read .
that's fucked up .
tsk tsk .
and you have no idea who this is from?
nope .
none .
but from all i know , you are like , uh like don juan or something .
don juan .
i gotta go .
you want me to keep the letter for forensic evidence or ... clues?
or don .

well , but knowing sherry , she probably hasn't played her last card yet .

probably not .
anyway , you've never had trouble finding interesting females .
i mean , uh , that's the way your life has been though .
right?
you're like , uh like don juan .
winston , please stop saying that .
hey .
about this letter i did examine the postmark under my microscope .
<i>and it is too faint to read, </ i> <i>but the stamp </ i> it's got on it a woodpecker .
<i>what does that mean to you? </ i>
<i>anything? </ i>
well , what i think we should do ... is to narrow down the possibilities .
winston , this is probably someone playing a joke on me .
if not , then ... whatever .
it seems so unfair someone to write a letter like this ... and and and not sign it?
don't you want to know who is the mother of your son?
my hypothetical son?
no , winston .
<i>i don't , okay? </ i>
okay .
then we can just drop it .
<i>we can? </ i>
we can , of course .
okay .
<i>good . </ i>
it's dropped .
but then how can you ignore something like this?
you need to treat this as a sign .
what kind of sign?
<i>of the direction of your life . </ i>
of this present moment .
<i>you need to solve this mystery ... </ i> and find out which of your women it was that you impregnated with your semen 20 years ago .

mmm .
when we were together , you were so passionate about becoming a lawyer .
i mean , you were ... very passionate .
yeah , well , passion's a funny thing .
<i>i have a doctorate</ i> <i>in animal behavior . </ i>
but that was sort of after the fact .
it's an odd story .
i'm getting into odd stories .
well , i was a very successful lawyer .
i had no life , though , outside my work , except for my dog , winston .
your dog's named winston?
<i>yes . </ i>
<i>but then he died ... </ i> suddenly .
i'm sorry .
oh , no .
it was , uh
it was years ago .
but my new ability was this gift .
this gift from winston .
all right , you can come in again .
anyway , <i>after winston died</ i> <i>i got this gift . </ i>
<i>to </ i>
to read animals 'minds?
<i>no .
i told you</ i>
no .
i'm a communicator .
you see , soon after winston died ...
i realized that i could hear animals speak to me .
i mean , i certainly hadn't been aware of that before .
and i don't read animals 'minds .
<i>but when they want</ i> <i>to communicate, </ i>
<i>i can hear them . </ i>
you know , like you and i are talking .
<i>but we don't</ i> <i>read each other's minds . </ i>
is he saying something?
he says you have a hidden agenda .
he he said that?
i think you'd better go back outside now , ramon .
<i>animals can tell us</ i> <i>what they want, </ i> but that doesn't mean that that's what's best for them .
<i>[ knocking ] </ i>

no , what are you doing upsetting penny like that , huh?
i just needed to ask her a question .
yeah , i know you asked her a question .
now , listen .
i just don't think it's very sensitive of you ... comin 'out here to try to hurt penny's feelings , you know , to get back at her or whatever .
that just seems so rude .

that's my report , sherlock .
the general outline of what you put me through .
that's it?
and after all that , you're still no closer to knowing who's the mother of your son?
that's right .
but there was that one typewriter .
and the pink motorcycle .
and it was dora's pink , uh , business card .
and and and laura's pink bathrobe .
i think this whole thing is a farce , a fiasco .
as far as i know , you may have written that letter to me .
look , i'm really sorry that you got beat up and everything .
l l l i feel that it was somehow my fault .
it was .
kind of strange , too , how , uh ,
carmen's magic dog was named winston .
yeah [ stammers ]
look , man , i really put a lot of work into this thing .
i thought that it was really important that you know whether or not you had a son .
i mean , it's your life .
you got to live your life , right?
i <i>was</ i> living my life , winston .
i still am .
what's this?
it's pink .
it's a note i found in my foyer when i got back .
red ink on pink paper .
it's from sherry .
what?
from sherry?
why didn't you tell me?
may i see it?
envelope and paper not exactly the same size .
you know , the handwriting ... seems pretty close to the address on the envelope , but i can't be sure .
sherry still likes you .
you think that sherry could have sent the first letter ... and made the whole thing up just to fuck with you?
who knows?
you know , i've got to go .
i think i have just enough time to stop home and compare the handwriting ... and then hopefully punch in at work on time .
you coming?
no .
i just need a little break from all of this .
look , don't worry .
we're still going to solve this mystery .
didn't i see you at the airport last night?
i don't know .
did you?
yeah .
you on a road trip?
yeah .
something like that .
you look hungry .
can i buy you a sandwich or something?
uh , no , that's okay .
you can relax .
i'm not gay .
i'm not a cop .
just a guy who sees a guy who might need a sandwich .
okay .
thanks .
but could you get something to go?
i'd sorta rather stay outside .
sure .
how about a nice club sandwich?
i'm vegetarian .
you eat cheese?
yeah , sometimes .
l i like cheese .
okay , i got it .
i'll be right back .
<i>[ door opens , closes ] </ i>
thanks .
you're welcome .
hey .
you found us a place .
all right .
let's see here .
big cheese and veggie sandwich ... with mushrooms .
fries mmm .
extra large .
two waters .
two coffees .
my mom put that there ... <i>for good luck . </ i>
thanks for the food .
ahh .
no problem , chief .
you called me chief?
yeah .
why?
what happened to your eye?
i , uh
i ran into somebody .
somebody's fist .
you a gangster?
no .
i wish .
no , i was , uh i was in computers .
computers and girls .
what about you , chief?
i'm interested in , uh , philosophy .
philosophy and girls .
sounds pretty good .
think so?
so , uh , as just a guy who gave another guy a sandwich , you have any , like , philosophical tips or anything ... for a guy on a kind of road trip?
you asking me?
yeah .
well
the past is gone .
i know that .
the future ... isn't here yet , whatever it's going to be .
so , all there is is is this .
the present .
that's it .
are you a buddhist?
no .
are you?
uh , i'm not sure yet .
i'm sorry that's the best i have to offer at the moment .
no , i appreciate it .
i like what you said .
it's better than some , like , fatherly sounding bullshit .
is that ... what your father's like?
ah , that's not a good subject .
hey , i gotta go , man .
i'm sorry .
thanks again for the sandwich and stuff .
hold on a second .
wait .
i know you think that i'm your father , don't you?
what?
just tell me .
you can talk to me , chief .
man , you're fucked up .
wait a second .
wait a second .
wait !
