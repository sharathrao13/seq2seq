who was that on the phone?
eh?
it was some guy from the community centre .
he wants to get some coaches for the kids 'soccer league .
are you gonna do it?
maybe next year , if things calm down at work a little .
that's what you said last year .
you want to rub some lotion on my back?
maybe later .
i don't want to get all these papers greasy .
alan , we have to be consistent .
successive approximations to the goal , remember?
god , that language just turns me on .
ok , if you don't want to do it , you don't have to .
i do .
i do want to do it .
it's just that book .
you know , it zaps all the spontaneity .
the point is , to get the spontaneity back .
obviously we're not there yet .
look ,
i want this as much as you do .
i want to get things back .
no , i don't want to get things back .
i want to make it better .
better than it's ever been .
so ... ... let's get to work .
excuse me , where did you get that?
this guy i work with at the museum .
we haven't gotten stoned since college .
mm hm .
and it was the best sex we ever had .
what about the kids?
they're sound asleep .
don't answer that .
it might be my morning meeting .
hello?
oh , sure .
hold on .
it's for you .
do you want me to take a message?
i'd better see who it is .
here she is .
hello .
oh , hi .
oh , no .
that's ok .
yeah , i have the keys .
why?
marnie , you know , we're sure gonna miss you .
here you go .
so , alan ...
marnie and i were just calculating your chances of beating me out of this vp slot .
what do you think?
slim or none?
with your warmth and charm , none .
yeah not to mention the quarter i just had
bottom line says it all , pal .
oh , excuse me .
gee , i'm gonna miss neil .
i really will miss you .
that's not exactly what i meant .
i mean , um ...
you got the wrong impression .
listen ,
wendy and i have been married for 12 years .
you've been flirting with me all week .
that's not it exactly .
i find you very attractive .
so , do you want to come home with me?
hey , wake up .
hey .
you're home .
yeah .
what time is it?
it's late .
we need to talk .
what's wrong?
i lied to you .
there was no business dinner .
you remember that temp i was telling you about marnie?
verna's replacement .
i was at her apartment tonight .
just tell me .
it was like i was someone else .
she kissed me .
we kissed .
it was wonderful .
i'd be lying if i said it wasn't .
then it all just hit me .
it was like you and brooke and daniel and the house and ... our whole lives together ...
it was like you were all in the room with me .
and you made me realise what i was doing .
i left .
i've just been driving around .
look ...
my point is , our marriage means more to me than i ever thought .
it's everything , and we've got to do something .
we got to ...
anything .
we've got to fix it .
i don't want to lose you , and i don't want to lose the kids .
i couldn't handle that .
you're not alone in this , you know .
what do you mean?
remember the pancake house where we used to take the kids last summer?
the waiter there ryan .
sandy hair , mid twenties .
what , you had an affair with him?
no ... ... but i thought about it .
a lot .
whenever i made love with you ,
i fantasised about him .
really?
both times?
it's not funny , alan .
i know .
oh .
i know .
i started going for lunch alone there because i wanted him all to myself .
that's not the way it should be .
i don't want parts of my life that i can't share with you .
do you think the car will be ok?
it'll be fine .
don't worry .
we have not been down here in so long .
we got some time to kill before we pick up the kids .
i thought it would be fun .
we should find a thrift store and buy the kids a costume .
ah , what luck !
costumes .
yeah !
that's not exactly what i had in mind .
come on , take a chance .
live dangerous .
honey .
so what?
she hasn't had two kids .
what do you suppose this is?
the super v 19 auto flagellator , guaranteed to give you years and years of erotic pleasure .
ok .
let's go .
thank you .
thanks .
what did you buy?
a swingers 'magazine?
are you kidding?
they're all normal people .
they're non pros .
they're like us .
can you imagine soliciting total strangers?
you're right .
i'll take it back .
um ... wait .
couldn't hurt to look .
come on .
daniel .
come on .
you know that thing we were talking about before?
you did hide it?
i did .
don't worry .
is it my birthday present?
you know ... i wasn't serious .
i have to admit , though , it is an intriguing thought .
cos it's my birthday in two weeks , you know .
oh?
is that a fact?
oh , i completely forgot .
come on , we're down to the ts .
we don't have a single prospect .
keep going .
the travises .
bill's always undressing you mentally on the tennis court .
i like them too much .
i don't want to risk the friendship .
do you want to do it with people we hate?
how could i possibly face her at work the next day?
easy .
you just say , " hi , becky , you were incredible last night !
keep going .
ok .
no .
oh , the wakefields .
you're kidding !
that's everybody?
that's everybody .
i had the good sense to leave out family members and the bradleys , with neil's winning personality .
you two compete in enough areas enough already enough .
well , that's it , then .
we don't know a single person we can do it with , and it's too scary calling up strangers .
well , still , it was fun fantasising .
you know ... ... we could make up our own ad .
hm?
we'd be in total control .
we could get a po box and we could screen all the mail .
you can't be serious .
i could be .
if you are .
no , no .
we're not using a picture in this ad .
yeah , but we'll need one eventually .
ha !
this one .
couldn't you find one without the kids?
we'll just cut 'em out .
just like that?
just like that .
ok .
how about this?
curious but yellow?
so are we .
happy but restless suburbanites ...
... seek twin sparks to rekindle flame .
dirty minds , meticulously clean bodies .
expect the same with you or no go .
what do you think?
they sound perfect .
you check on the kids?
they're fine .
still doing homework .
anything interesting yet?
these are the rejects .
what's this?
this is my rubber butt plug .
oh !
that killed it for me , too .
what about these two?
they're gorgeous .
they are .
they're both men .
jesus !
oh , this is cute .
sorry about the out of season's greetings , but we're fresh out of centrefolds .
you two sound just wonderful .
send us a picture , give us a call .
let's explore the possibilities .
love and kisses , jack and louise .
keeper .
hi , who's calling?
hi , this is alan .
this is alan .
this is jack .
this is jack .
hi , look , i'm not sure if we're supposed to use last names .
whatever you feel comfortable with , al .
did you get the picture?
yes we did .
and , to be perfectly honest , i haven't seen louise this excited in a long time .
it's a good thing i'm not the jealous type .
listen , wendy and i , we've never done anything like this before .
i assume you have .
just a few times .
so would tomorrow night be ok for you?
tomorrow?
neil bradley's already made his presentation .
the client is looking at his watch .
i'm talking to a client .
is that paul mcgrew?
no .
how do you ever find anything in this mess?
so , who's neil bradley?
some prick i work with .
uh huh .
and who's paul mcgrew?
what , are you writing a book?
hey , i'm sorry .
look , i'm just trying to get to know you better .
he owns a large hotel chain .
i'm a sales manager for western division for a food service company .
i'm in sales , too .
high end audio and video stuff .
my wife does a little modelling .
really?
my wife works for a children's museum , part time .
and we have two kids .
great .
ok , listen .
there's a place downtown called the zebra lounge .
let's meet there tomorrow night , say eight o'clock .
no strings attached .
ok .
ok , bye .
get into it
# i've been down in such a dark place
# i've been a phoney and a fool
# just to please everybody who said that they love me
# and i spat out the food that i was too afraid to swallow
# i've been locked up in this attic
# still with love on my brain
# and i tried so hard to get a little sunshine
# yes , i tried so hard
# to break the cycle of pain
# pain , pain ...
# get into it , baby ...
alan , wendy .
i'm jack .
this is my wife louise , the most beautiful woman in the world .
hello .
hi .
get comfortable and jack will order some drinks .
tina , louise and i will have the usual .
and for you?
a white label , please .
let me guess .
on the rocks?
yes .
er , the same .
thank you .
i'm so glad you guys decided to get together with us .
we haven't decided anything yet .
you know , your ad was the first one that we'd answered in several months .
i guess ...
i guess louise and i are getting a little more discriminating .
i suppose we should be flattered .
i don't know .
i figured i'd put that out there .
it might be a bit more comforting .
it's lucky you found us first .
we are your first , right?
oh , yes .
most definitely .
you know what i've learned from louise?
if you just relax and let yourself go , you can really have a lot of fun .
we've just never done anything like this before .
nothing's going to happen that you don't want to .
oh .
thank you .
you're welcome .
ok ...
a toast .
to ...
hey .
will you excuse us a minute?
are we crazy?
i think they're pretty normal , considering .
do you like him?
i don't know .
i mean , he's charming .
he's ... kind of intriguing .
excuse me .
how do you feel about her?
she's nice , attractive , very sexy .
yeah , she is very sexy .
i like his eyes .
well , it was nice meeting you two .
we're going to pass .
i'm so disappointed .
no , that's ok , if that's your choice .
but we were having such a nice talk .
please , come finish your drinks .
sure .
you know , baby ,
i wish it would have been that easy for us to fix our little fling problem .
you're not having affairs yet , are you?
no , no .
not quite .
it's problems like that that are difficult to solve .
have you guys read any self help books or done any counselling?
we haven't had much luck with them .
we appreciate your concern , but , well , we're just not ready for this .
you know ,
alan , sometimes it's not such a good idea to wait until you feel like you're ready .
i know for louise and i , it felt like we were running out of time .
you know , if we were to do this , how's it going to work?
how would it work?
hypothetically .
of course .
our house is out of the question .
with the kids ours , too .
we have the painters in .
why don't you guys leave it up to us?
hypothetically .
yeah .
how does this sound?
whatever we do , we do it together .
when one of us wants to stop , we both stop , no questions asked .
and we'll never do anything that might hurt the kids .
i couldn't have put it better myself .
you want me to sign it?
no , your word's good enough for me .
look , if this doesn't feel right , we'll just ... cut it short and come home .
right .
do you think we're dressed right?
i don't know .
i've never dressed for an orgy before .
wow , mom .
you look beautiful .
thank you .
you too , daddy .
thanks .
works for them .
i want you to do everything nancy asks you to do .
i promise there'll be something in it for you .
wow !
that's the biggest car i've ever seen .
hi .
who are they?
just some friends .
we'd better hurry before they bring out the whole neighbourhood .
see you .
bye , mommy .
bye , daddy .
bye .
wow !
glass of champagne to the first person who can guess what louise is doing to me right now .
kidding .
you've gone to such expense .
no trouble .
a friend of mine owns the car .
so , how's the painting going?
what's that?
you said you were getting your house painted .
oh , no , we just say that .
jack and i like to keep our home private .
i wish we'd thought of that .
you guys aren't in a hurry to get home , are you?
our sitter can stay the night ...
if we ask her to .
good .
perfect .
so , al ...
is it all right if i call yon al?
excuse me?
forget it .
um ...
would you like to trade seats with me?
because , although louise and i ... don't look like it , we're sitting over here feeling a bit like a senate subcommittee .
is that all right?
sure .
yeah?
ok .
so , how do we look?
fabulous .
i would say you're the second sexiest couple in the car .
you look like
you had a tough day at the office .
actually , i did .
alan's up for a vice presidency and he's got some pretty tough competition .
ah , yes .
neil bradley .
little prick .
a little tense?
you don't like champagne?
er , no , it's the bubbles .
honey?
yes?
can we get wendy
some white label?
sure .
here , let me .
er , dilemma .
pick your hand .
thank you .
here , i'll take this .
a toast
let's have some fun .
to fun !
come , let me show you the view .
don't worry .
she's in good hands .
what did we get him?
let's see .
no , no .
it's already ...
it's half wrapped .
hi , you are through to the barnets .
leave a message after the beep .
hey , it's jack here .
where have you two been hiding?
louise and i would love to see you two again ...
didn't you return their last call?
no , i never got round to it .
honey , you're not trying to string them along , are you?
i'm just not comfortable with discussing it , that's all .
tell them that we had a really good time and we appreciate their concern but we don't need them any more .
they'd take it too personally .
yes .
well , then , tell them that it doesn't fit into our lifestyle .
i'm sure they can understand that .
ok .
i can do that .
i'll call them .
good .
good .
good .
yes .
what?
they were incredible , though , weren't they?
yeah , they were , but so are we .
one ...
two ...
three ...
blow !
are you about finished with that thing?
the ice cream's melting .
how come you scooped it out so soon?
wendy asked me to .
here , mom , let's cut this cake .
hello , everybody .
sorry we're late .
what a great place to have a party .
jack .
louise .
everybody , this is jack and louise .
hi .
friends .
and this is wendy's mom .
oh !
hey , jack .
ken .
nice to meet you .
and this must be the birthday boy .
is it for me?
no , it's for me .
happy birthday , daniel . from aunt louise and uncle jack .
buddy , you have fun with that .
they're not our aunt and uncle .
they're just being friendly .
be polite .
is anybody going to give us some cake?
of course , yes , have some cake .
do you have a smaller piece?
thanks .
i need a fork and ... ... maybe a napkin .
oh , would you like to have some?
we'll get our own , ok?
thanks , pal .
who wants to see uncle jack juggle?
me !
all right .
check it out .
you're doing great , honey .
thank you , baby .
alan , if i hadn't called your secretary ,
i never would have known about this panty .
huh?
ta da !
everybody loves jack .
don't you find him attractive?
because i find your husband ken very good looking .
ken , get the kids .
it's time to go .
one hand .
sorry .
maybe i can try behind my back .
i could kill your secretary .
you asked her to give out the directions .
yes , to invited guests .
and what was she supposed to do?
interrogate every caller?
i got a present , too , from aunt louise .
it's my unbirthday present .
a bracelet?
it's nice , honey .
it's really nice .
yeah , i know .
i'll call you on tuesday .
yep .
congratulations .
what for?
for finally getting a shot with paul mcgrew .
no kidding?
all my nuisance calls must have paid off .
apparently so .
his office called .
he wants to play tennis .
we've got a court for one o'clock .
alan , this is our big chance .
when he gets here , you introduce us .
i'll take it from there .
that's gonna be a little hard .
i don't even know what he looks like .
well , that must be him right there .
good afternoon , gentlemen .
no .
alan , good to see you .
and you must be the big boss .
i thought you didn't know what he looks like .
i don't know what he looks like .
that's somebody else .
a friend , sort of .
hey , fellas .
i'm jack bauer .
adam frazier .
great to see you , adam .
hey , alan .
jack .
our fourth's running a little late .
excuse me?
paul mcgrew .
it's why you're here , isn't it?
yes , but ...
jack , buddy .
you're gonna love this guy .
hey .
paul .
good to see you .
hi .
paul mcgrew .
adam frazier .
hi .
alan barnet .
finally .
jack says you'll make me an offer i can't refuse .
we're gonna try .
if it's anywhere near as good as the deal he cut me , we're gonna be in business .
let's get to it .
so , paul's company commissioned my company to do his whole chain .
monitors , speakers , everything .
big screen tvs , wireless speakers in all the bars .
it is going to be sensational .
don't hurt him , alan .
get you next time , bauer .
any time , paul .
good game .
take it easy , paul .
see you at the office .
i enjoyed that .
i got to do that more often .
he likes you already .
i can tell .
how did you do this?
it was easy .
just closed him with a great deal .
just like that .
it's all in the technique .
fpqs .
what?
friendly , persistent , questioning stare .
you know , when you get to that critical moment in a transaction ...
right . ... this is what i do .
is that good , or what?
you didn't tell him about ... us .
of course not .
this is business , buddy .
come on .
let's play .
let's play .
jack could sell circles around me .
well , what did he do it for?
commission?
finder's fee?
to get what he wants .
which is?
us .
alan , i thought we said we wouldn't do that any more .
i know .
but it was a huge favour he did .
i mean , i may get the promotion .
there could be a big bonus .
it seems rude not to ...
that's ridiculous .
i'm sorry .
well ...
forget it .
ok , but is that ...
i mean , is that what you want?
do you want to do it again?
do you?
you want her again , don't you?
one more time wouldn't kill me .
ok .
but just one more time .
when was the last time this car was tuned up?
i don't drive it any more , honey .
you do .
if it was my car , i'd pay someone to drive it off a cliff .
when you want to chauffeur the kids round all day , you can take the mini van and i'll take my car back .
you still have a great ass , you know?
thank you .
you have a great ass , too .
i could get jealous tonight .
i'm hoping you do .
really?
well , two can play that game .
give us a kiss .
hello , barnets .
we missed you .
we've been looking forward to this .
you look amazing .
thank you .
i got my hair done .
hi .
hello .
you're looking pretty smooth yourself , alan .
why , thank you .
i actually shaved .
what do you think?
this is awesome .
should have worn toga .
you won't be needing one .
come on .
i thought we'd try something different tonight .
you guys ever done ecstasy?
i took a quaalude once in college
well , they've made some amazing advances on the recreational drug front .
i'm up for it .
are you cold?
that's nice .
you've never done this?
no .
to good friends .
to good business .
have you ever been with a woman before?
believe
# coming down , going down , getting down , coming down
# cos you came around
# come and seize the disease
# won't you please stay away for my hands are weak
# i may just die
# and i'll do it again and again and again
# and again
# feeling sin
# feeling sin
# feeling fingers through my hair
# feeling sad
# feeling sad
# don't you feel it?
# i may just die
# but i'd do it again and again
# and again and again
# i'm sad
# too sad am i
# i'm lost in your love
# nothing says you don't believe
# you can't believe
# lies ...
mom , daniel put three spoonfuls of sugar on his cereal .
mom , why don't you put it in the blender?
that's how dad always does it .
i don't want to hear the blender this morning .
hello .
hi , mom .
can i call you back?
why didn't you get us up?
i'm on the phone .
um , what?
i forgot to leave the number with the sitter .
we'll be late for school .
nothing's wrong .
i'm fine .
i'll call you back later , ok?
bye .
i want my orange juice .
eat your cereal .
we don't want to be late .
i knew that was gonna happen .
you know what?
you guys , go get your backpacks on and i'll write you a note .
go .
why don't you ever help me?
about last night ...
let's not talk about it , ok?
it's over .
i'm gonna get the kids .
so , are you ready to face the food smart guys?
i wouldn't worry about me , alan .
you know , it was supposed to be my account .
frazier must really want it to send both of us .
if he'd really wanted it , he'd have sent just me .
hey , guys .
neil bradley , right?
yeah .
great suit .
jack bauer .
how are you?
hi .
alan's told me all about you .
see you at the meeting , neil .
right .
you take care now .
you don't call any more .
is that why you came?
yeah .
i've been kind of swamped at work .
oh .
well , listen , buddy ,
louise really misses you .
know what i'm saying?
but you're busy .
i understand .
can't make it tonight .
let's try tomorrow .
it's brooke's recital tomorrow .
i'll check my calendar .
if i didn't know any better , i'd think you were trying to avold us .
ok .
ok .
next week .
how about a show , dinner?
whatever you want .
great .
see how easy that was .
call me .
promise?
i promise .
see you soon .
thank you very much for your presentation .
you obviously put a lot of work into it .
we'll think about it and ... get back to you .
ok .
hank , with all due respect , there is nothing to think about .
we all know there isn't anyone else in this industry who can match our quality , service or price .
so , what do you say?
what a day !
get promoted in the morning , close a deal the same night .
promoted?
what the hell are you talking about?
didn't adam tell you?
he picked me .
no , he didn't tell me .
he probably didn't want you to fuck up this deal .
fuck it up?
i closed it , you piece of shit .
we'll bring it up at your review .
see you tomorrow , pal .
are you coming?
no way .
louise , i can't do this .
wendy and i , we're not ...
you'll never have this with your wife .
hey , buddy .
now , that's what i call a promotion .
you ass kissing piece of shit !
ow .
jesus !
i don't know .
she won't come out of the bedroom .
daddy had to work late .
where have you been?
who are you talking to?
grandma .
mom's in a bad mood .
like , what else is new?
hey , margaret .
yeah , i just walked in .
look , whatever she's upset about , i'll take care of it .
yeah .
ok .
don't worry about it .
i'll call you .
we're not the right kind of people , alan .
whatever made us think we could do this?
honey , we've made some mistakes , but they're in the past .
it's behind us .
it's done .
everything is ok .
really .
it's going to be ok .
really .
what happened to your lip?
i banged it getting in the car .
it's nothing .
promise me that we'll never see them again .
i promise .
i swear to god .
i swear to god .
are you wearing a new cologne?
no .
no , it must be that soap .
you're right .
you're right , you know .
we ought to get things back on track .
what do you want to do?
just ... something ... normal .
are you gonna answer the phone?
hello .
oh , my god !
what ...
the meeting broke up around 10 : 15 .
the last time i saw neil , he was heading for the elevator .
then you didn't leave together?
no , i went to the men's room .
we take separate cars .
so was it a mugging?
what happened?
he was beaten to death .
they think a pipe or a lug wrench or something .
jesus .
after you left the men's room , what did you do?
i went to the parking garage , got in my car .
did you notice anything unusual in the garage?
no .
just got in my car and left .
the parking attendant's records show that you left the garage at 10 : 44 .
wait a minute .
is alan a suspect?
honey .
some of the night staff said you and mr bradley had an argument in the lobby at about 10 : 20 .
it wasn't really an argument .
we were discussing a business deal .
i'm just establishing a timeline .
detective , if you think alan had anything to do with this , he is the straightest , most law abiding citizen in the world .
as of now , we don't have any suspects .
so , are we through , then?
sure .
i know where i can find you .
sorry to bother you both so late .
oh , what happened to your lip?
oh , i banged it on the car door .
i'm a real klutz sometimes .
i'm still hungry .
let's make cookies .
we haven't done that in a long time .
chocolate chip .
i like peanut butter .
what do you think , dad?
huh?
oh , i'm sorry .
whatever .
uncle jack !
we just had pizza .
hey , right on , brother !
where's aunt louise?
she's at home , but she told me to give you a big hug .
now , run in there and see .
i brought you a surprise .
oh , boy !
went for pizza , huh?
yeah .
how did you get in?
everybody always leaves a key right under their potted plant .
mom , dad , come see what uncle jack bought us .
wow , they're almost life size .
this is awesome !
we asked for one of these for christmas the last two years , but mom and dad said we couldn't afford it .
thanks , uncle jack .
he's not your uncle , daniel .
why don't you take your brother outside?
oh , do we have to?
just go .
i hope you like where i put it .
i went through the whole house and this seemed
like the best spot .
can we get right to the point?
we can't accept the tv .
you have to take it back .
and ... we really resent you breaking into our house .
can you get out of my chair , please?
i don't understand .
i was just trying to surprise you guys .
we don't want to see you or louise any more .
it's not right for us .
and , frankly , we wish we'd never gotten into it .
that's too bad .
louise and i always saw this as a long term relationship .
it's not going to work out .
hang on , guys .
i mean , what happened here?
it's just a tv .
listen , louise and i have been playing the field for a long time .
we've had a lot of fun , but that's not so safe to do any more .
we had always hoped that we would meet a nice couple so that we could all just settle down .
jack ...
we are totally committed to you .
we're not interested .
you got to find somebody else .
in the meantime , get your tv , take it out of here , and then we can all go on with our lives .
you make it all sound so simple , al .
it is , jack .
no , it's not , wendy .
you see , underneath all ,
louise and i , we want the same things that you guys do .
nice house , family , friends .
you've really opened our eyes .
jack .
i'm sorry but this ...
this is not our problem .
i was looking forward to spending more time with you since you got the promotion .
you got that promotion?
i ... i was next in line .
he deserved it .
too bad what happened to neil .
i think it's time you ... go .
yeah .
you're probably right .
you bastard !
turn it off !
it's a gift .
for your eyes only .
i won't show anyone else .
you won't believe this .
give me the control .
wait till you see what we got .
come on , guys .
let's go outside .
you think jack killed neil , don't you?
no .
i don't know .
what do you think?
i think we don't know a damn thing about either one of them .
i've been thinking about this vice presidency and it ... it doesn't feel right .
alan , just relax .
you've earned it .
now , we all feel bad about neil , but what happened wasn't your fault .
every dog has his day .
this is yours .
jack !
how are you?
good , adam .
nice to see you .
congratulations on the promotion .
why are you here?
i was just going to tell you about this .
jack is outfitting us with a closed circuit video surveillance system offices , warehouses , parking lots .
he's going to make sure our employees are safe from now on .
there's nothing more important .
i'll get those figures from you later , jack .
you take care , now .
well , everything's falling right into place .
i've got work to do .
al an .
you know how much we love you guys , right?
do me a favour .
tell wendy to call off the investigation .
what the hell are you talking about?
call her .
ask her what she's been doing all day .
fuck , verna !
i'm sorry .
sorry .
that detective called .
he wants to talk to you again .
thank you .
let's go , daniel !
come on , hustle it , hustle it .
positions , kids .
positions !
this guy at the bar said jack put a man's head through a window and louise just laughed .
people have fights in bars .
the guy was louise's first husband .
i found out at the library that he was killed in a skiing accident a month later .
so?
there were no witnesses .
that was a really dumb thing , going down that bar all by yourself .
too bad .
the point is , i think we have to tell the police .
what?
tell them what?
that the couple we've been swinging with aren't upright citizens?
if we tell the police , everything's gonna come out .
all there is to do is to put as much distance between us and them as possible .
did you see me?
did you see what i did?
sorry , champ .
what happened?
he just scored the winning goal .
oh , god !
excuse me .
daniel !
hello?
bottle of brandy for the new neighbours .
hi , neighbours .
no , you're not .
i love the suburbs .
look who's here .
it's great .
oh , hi !
so , what do you think?
ok , you've made your point .
this isn't gonna change anything .
cos we're not like you .
and we never will be .
what has happened to you two?
i mean , didn't we make your lives more exciting?
isn't that what you wanted?
all we wanted to do was be close to you .
you just stay away from us .
you better straighten her out , alan .
everything's fine over here .
this doesn't need to be complicated .
i spoke to a couple of agents today .
the real estate market's still in the dumper .
our house is upside down .
what's that supposed to mean?
it means that we ...
it means that we owe more money on our loan than the house is worth .
you still want to sell?
of course .
what do you think?
i don't understand why you want to sell this house .
it's an awful thing to do to the kids , make them change schools ,
leave their friends .
there are other factors involved , mother .
is there something wrong between you and alan?
no !
i mean , no , why would you ask such a thing?
well ...
it's just that ...
oh , dear .
it's just ... that brooke asked me today if anything happened to you or her father , could she and daniel live with me .
now , why would she say a thing like that?
i don't know , mother .
she's a kid .
they say strange things .
is that the fella that came to daniel's birthday party?
yeah .
the strange couple .
yes , mother .
i didn't know they were your neighbours .
can we have dessert in front of the tv?
too bad we can't watch it on our big screen .
brooke .
you have a big screen tv?
we used to have one .
but mom broke it .
too bad , huh?
who wants ice cream with their pie?
i want to hear about this tv .
it was a present from uncle jack .
mom smashed it on purpose .
yeah , just a second .
it's for you , dad .
it's a detective .
oh , boy !
let's have our pie in the other room .
hello?
er , no , look , i've already told you everything i know .
no , i'm with my family .
no , monday i can't .
i have meetings all day .
tuesday?
10am .
sure .
ok .
hi , how was your day?
i can't stop thinking about this meeting with that cop tomorrow .
you're just gonna tell him the same thing as before .
where you were that night and what you did .
how complicated could that be?
daddy !
hey champ .
ah , ah , ah , ah !
how was your day?
ok .
where's your sister?
she's still at scouts .
no , she isn't .
she went next door .
to the newmans '?
no , to uncle jack and aunt louise's .
brooke where are you?
we're playing dress up .
how do i look?
how dare you do this to my child?
it's just pretend , mom .
wendy , come on .
go straight home .
we're calling the police .
what are you talking about?
she came here on her own .
she's 11 years old , you sick fuck .
you better not have touched her .
take it easy .
it was an innocent little game .
as if you're innocent .
to people like you , innocent means you didn't get caught .
you mean people like us .
we know about your husband's accident .
and what about neil?
oh , well , i like this game .
go ahead .
call the cops .
but you might want to consider what people might think of some dirty little facts about you two .
like your mother , wendy .
or adam frazier and the boys at work , alan .
or how about the parents of all those kiddies that come through wendy's museum?
and you know who'd really like to see that tape?
child protective services .
they'd have your kids out of here so quick , it'd look like a fucking alien abduction .
you two are repulsive .
you didn't find me repulsive the other night at your offices .
what?
that's right , wendy . you see your husband here , he fucked me .
and he fucked me in an elevator .
and he fucked me better than he's ever fucked you .
do we understand each other?
look , it was stupid and spur of the moment .
i didn't think .
in the elevator , for christ's sake !
look , wendy , i'm sorry .
i'll do whatever you want .
you broke the rules .
there are no rules .
it was a big mistake .
a mistake that never would have occurred to me .
i was raised catholic , for christ's sake !
you were in this every step of the way .
not every step .
and now they have their hooks in our kids .
i'm calling the police .
stop it !
wait .
i don't know how i'm going to tell my mother .
i might be able to get a job in cleveland .
of course , i won't have a reference .
you make your plans .
just don't include me and the kids .
did you hear that?
shit !
yeah .
hey , buddy .
borrowed your lug wrench a few weeks ago .
i thought i'd get you another one .
you took my lug wrench?
with my fingerprints on it .
don't worry , it's in a safe place .
see you , alan .
by the way , did you really think we'd let the two of you leave?
here it is in a nutshell .
you guys win .
we decided to give it a try .
no , everything went fine with the cops .
i stayed calm and said all the right things .
it's like the guy said about the prospect of being hanged .
it concentrates the mind wonderfully .
we figured it was time to call a truce .
all of us , the four of us .
yeah , that's what i was calling about .
yeah .
us , too .
we have a great place .
it's very secluded .
a client of mine owns it .
he's gonna be away .
right .
well , you talk to louise and we can set a date .
great .
talk to you soon .
do you really think you can do this?
you haven't braided my hair for a really long time .
i guess i just felt like it .
does this mean you're not mad at me any more?
i was never mad at you , sweetheart .
then how come you act so mean all the time?
it's not your fault .
i'm sorry , honey .
um ...
maybe one day you'll have a family of your own , and you'll find out how hard it is to try to do everything right all the time .
try to be everything for everybody , but it is not possible .
we make mistakes .
but i promise you ... that things are gonna change .
i'm gonna do better , ok?
i love you .
you're a pretty girl .
do you think they're suspicious?
maybe .
the thing to remember is , jack can't think past his dick .
so if we keep their minds focused on sex , we should be ok .
hey , look .
brooke's retainer .
hey , guys .
what a really nice place .
love the boots , wendy .
scotch?
no , thank you .
are you sooner?
it's your favourite .
i'm fine .
really .
thanks .
baby .
come here .
why don't we go upstairs and go exploring?
that is a great idea .
that way , wendy and i can stay right here and snuggle .
i tell you what .
why don't the two of you go upstairs and wendy and i will meet you up there soon .
you know , you guys are acting a little weird .
are you sure that you're not still holding a grudge?
no .
er , no .
can't we just talk?
why rush it?
let's enjoy it .
baby .
hm?
i'm getting a really bad feeling about this .
really?
why don't you feel these?
i'm glad we could all be friends again .
wendy , honey , i'm so sorry .
i never meant it to go that far .
if i could have thought of a way to stop it , i would have .
just get in there and get it over with while they're still asleep .
you think that's gonna make your problems go away?
i wish you had the nerve to pull that trigger .
then i'd die respecting you .
go to bed , alan .
come on .
come on .
come on , you piece of shit !
perfect !
now what?
our car broke down once in yellowstone .
you know what we did?
let me guess .
you fucked .
right there , in the middle of the park .
it seemed like the only thing to do .
what i've learned is , if you find yourself in a situation beyond your control , the smartest thing you can do is relax and go along for the ride .
then there was that cute little park ranger that came out of nowhere .
that's right .
he was going to cite us .
yeah .
baby , remember santorini?
all that beautiful black sand?
of course , you stole the show by going topless on the beach .
had all those greek boys about ready to snap it right there .
how long till we reach the gas station?
you know what?
we should go there .
we could bring the kids .
that's a great idea .
of course , i can't wait to see that black sand all over wendy's big beautiful tits .
lou !
you want to do this now?
jack , keep your eye on the road !
we're fine , guys .
quiet .
i'm trying to concentrate .
jack , we will walk .
please !
slow down !
don't stop .
i'll never stop .
jack !
jack , look out !
we crashed .
we fucking crashed !
ha , ha ha !
we crashed !
louise?
louise?
baby?
louise?
lou !
louise?
louise !
louise?
oh , baby .
louise !
alan !
alan !
alan !
wendy !
come on , you guys .
you got to help us get out of here .
where are you guys?
i can't get my fucking leg out !
alan , i'm stuck !
come back and get us out of here .
you don't want to get rid of me .
you'll never get rid of me .
come on , guys .
we're still a team , right?
when this is all over ... ... we got to do it again .
alan !
how do you feel about getting the kids a puppy for christmas?
there's no way round it , really .
we practically promised it to them .
did i tell you the dentist said danny's gonna need braces?
bills .
bills , bills , bills , bills .
and more bills .
want a back rub?
really?
sure .
where's the lotion?
get the ball .
get the ball .
challenge , challenge .
danny , good boy !
