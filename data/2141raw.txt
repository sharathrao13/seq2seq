there's mass confusion here on the the platform .
this is unprecedented .
there you go .
thanks , leave it open .
okay .
what's the scene like right now?
all lines have stopped running completely .
no word on their resumption .
have the victims been identified?
the police are working on it , but none have been made yet .
we first reported that it was 50 highschool girls ... ... who jumped the tracks .
but we've since learned it was actually 54 students .
hello?
anyone there?
hello?
hello?
ms. kawaguchi?
jiro?
you scared me .
have you seen akko?
yes , i have .
she still out?
i guess so .
that's strange .
the store is so close .
yeah , i guess it is .
what's keeping her?
i don't know .
well whatever .
i'll call you when she returns .
thanks .
ms. kawaguchi?
ms. sawada?
ms. kawaguchi?
nurse kawaguchi?
yoko kawaguchi?
what an ordeal that turned out to be .
i think the power's out .
the bakery is closed so i walked all over .
did ms. kawaguchi go home?
i'm beat .
hey , where's yoko?
i think she went home .
oh .
you want her food .
um ... sure .
here .
ah , that feels good .
i'll see you later .
what're you doing?
you've still got blood on you .
your shoes .
where's kuroda?
we're all here .
listen up .
this was not a crime .
it's an accident .
stop looking so glum .
they weren't all from the same high school , were they?
no , they weren't .
so far we know it's 18 schools .
the connection .
it wasn't a crime .
i'll check it out .
it may have been some sort of cult .
a suicide cult?
ridiculous .
excuse me .
phone call .
i'd say it's too much tv , " the pied piper .
shibu here .
it's bothered me for a while .
what has?
you know , the suicides .
yeah ... go on ...
you at a computer?
yes .
i've got a web site for you to look at .
hold on .
call everyone .
go ahead .
www . maru ... ... ne .
jp
what is this?
the red dots ... are women .
the white ones are men .
what's it mean?
i had a hunch when i first saw it ... ... but after today , i'm sure of it .
there were 54 new red dots .
there are even more now .
when did you find this?
when did you find this?
recently .
it intrigued me .
after those 4 suicides the other day ... ... i saw 4 more dots .
it's a weird site .
this is all there is .
check out the provider .
tell me what you find , okay?
i'll do the same .
understood .
and you would be?
the bat .
no , i mean your real name .
the bat's fine .
all right , " the bat " it is .
do you have a web site?
i post on a bbs a lot , look for the bat there .
gotcha .
www . jikennews . com
gotta go now .
wait .
oh yeah , the dots appear before the suicides are reported .
anyway , good luck .
hello?
hello?
she hung up .
we've got another suicide .
go talk to the witnesses .
jesus !
may 27
yeah , there was a ...
sports bag?
yes .
it was found on the platform at the time .
yeah , here it is .
could you wait outside for a minute?
why?
please .
all right .
knock when you are finished .
same thing .
it may not be the same person , but it's human skin .
that is certain .
the stitches are the same size .
identical work .
the skin is stitched 10 centimeters apart .
there's so much of it .
we're looking at an incredible number of people .
you think they're different people?
we're not sure yet , but we think so .
each piece is different skin .
it's possible that skin from the same person is repeated somewhere ... ... if it's like the one found yesterday .
so together , it's skin from about 200 people then?
you could say that ... yes .
there are several bodies here .
we'll pry them apart later .
look here .
we won't know until tomorrow , but we're sure it's their skin .
so the other 100 or so skin samples ... ... could be from living people?
i have no idea ...
i'd prefer it be from corpses , though .
we'd have to check a lot of murder and accident victims .
most have already been cremated .
the remaining 100 are still to come .
that's totally absurd , impossible .
the tokyo bound train now arriving on track 8 .
for your safety , please stay behind the yellow line .
see you tomorrow .
good night .

i asked you a question !
there .
welcome to my pleasure room .
let's entertain them .
shut up and listen !
time and time again the sky is blue .
and yet it's strange how people seem to always fall in love .
an unfamiliar yellow dog ... ... keeps grinning as it tears us from the ones we love .
because the dead ...
because the dead ...
because the dead shine all night long .
i want to die as beautifully as joan of arc ... ... inside a bresson film .
lesson one , apply the shaving cream ... ... and smile as you then slowly slice away the heart .
because the dead ...
because the dead ...
because the dead shine all night long .
feel the warmth of the spring rain as it gently moistens down a cheek ... ... that's streaked with dried up tears .
a guileless boy but five years old stares blankly in the face of death ... ... while his heart is cut and torn away .
kuroda ...
the tattoo of the 6th chain .
this isn't suicide .
it's murder .
tell me .
which is murder , and which isn't?
is it murder starting today?
or is this a special exception?
it was murder from the start !
it was .
all of it .
i'm so sorry .
it's my fault .
i was blind .
hello?
yes , okay .
it's for you .

i think it's your son .
hello , mr. kuroda?

kuroda here .
kuroda , hold on .
hello?
why'd you do it?

what?
good bye .
wait !
do you understand?
i understand our connection .
i understand your connection to your wife .
i understand your connection to your children .
but as for your connection to yourself ...
if you die , will you lose the connection with yourself?
even if you die , your connection with your wife will remain .
so will your connection with your children .
but if you die , will you lose your connection with yourself?
will you live on?
are you connected to yourself?
why couldn't you feel the pain of others as you would your own?
why couldn't you bear the pain of others as you would your own?
you are the criminal .
you could only think of yourself .
you're scum .

hi , there .
my name's genesis .
i've had delusions of grandeur since i was a child .
may 31
just after 7 this morning ... ... the police arrested a group calling itself the suicide club ... ... and claiming responsibility for multiple murders .
the group used the internet to call upon people to kill themselves .
their proclaimed aim was social upheaval .
investigators are now working to uncover the details .
stand back please , move aside .
am i on camera?
good , good , good .
first i'd like to say reality is invisible to the naked eye .
you and me both know that life is a real bitch .
bring your best you say?
that's not good enough .
it's like that dessert song .
how's that go again?
the world is a jigsaw puzzle .
somewhere there's a fit for you .

the world is a jigsaw puzzle .
the world is a jigsaw puzzle .
somewhere there 's a fit for you .
a place where your puzzle piece belongs .

then make it so .
there 's nowhere for my piece to go .
find a match that lasts forever .
perhaps i better say so long .

even if you were to die ... ... your connection to your boyfriend would remain .
even if you were to die , your link to the world would remain .
so why are you living?
why did you come?
did you come to repair your connection with yourself?
or did you come to sever that connection?
are you now severed from yourself?
i am i. and i'm connected to myself .
are you related to you?
like between you and me , victim and assailant ... ... you and your boyfriend .
can you relate to yourself?

for your safety , please stay behind the yellow line .
this is dessert's final performance .
thanks for all your support .
our last message to you is ...
live as you please !
little did we know how little do we really know .
everyday we 're pressing the keys ... ... that execute a million commands .
if only you would say exactly what is on your mind ... ... and tell me how you really feel .
maybe i can lend a helping hand .
scary it's true , but loads of fun too .
to open up and feel the brand of life ... ... for each and everyone .
light yourself with life .
light yourself with love .
light yourself with memories .
all it takes is just a little heart and courage on your part .
turn yourself around and take it once again from the start .
though you may feel out of touch at times ...
... or fear a wicked spell has got your life in hand .
if by some chance , you share the feelings that i have for you ... ... come occupy the chasm of my heart .
together we can shed light on the dark .
scary , it's true .
but we 'll be happy too .
now do you really want to say good bye ...
... and leave me high and dry .
light yourself with life .
light yourself with love .
light yourself with memories .
as we go , we 'll forget the pain .
we 'll find life again .
