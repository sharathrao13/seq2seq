now , pete never took a single test .
pete fell out of his bedroom window twice .
where's pete today?
pete is pulling down $ 1 50k a year all because some alum got a little play on the kok tail cruise .
then there's the story of the '88 kok tail cruise .
those boys decided to to skimp on the party .
homemade wine coolers ... . . . a homeless stripper . . .
. . . soft core porn .
needless to say , the boys of '88 are still paying off their student loans .
i have no regrets .
that is why i've called this meeting .
this year's cruise is in grave danger .
'cause you'll be there?
will the social committee please rise?
gentlemen , the brothers standing before you have embezzled all of your parents 'hard earned money .
yeah , very funny , spencer .

i locked it .
well , if you locked it  i'm positive .
look , spence has the only other key .
yeah?
well , what the fuck are we gonna do now?
don't worry about it .

the videotape of adam humping the tri pis , man .
hmm?
doofer , what are you saying?
well , i'd just finished studying for some school when i noticed adam's speaker was tipped over .
on the floor was a little video camera rigged to a motion detector .
i found a thing .
i noticed that its input cable had come loose , so i carefully traced it to its source .
i got a thing .
it led to a metal footlocker at the bottom of adam's closet , which was , you know , already unlocked .
lnside , i found a videocassette recorder .
well , naturally , since it was his private property ,
i didn't touch anything .
you could see the safe right by his bed .
you were watching my tape?
no .
you're a pervert !

oww !
dave !
where are you? !
the first time i tried shoplifting , i got caught .

daisy , stop poking me in the butt .
sorry .
wingman !
wingman !
ugh !
wuh .
oh !
ohh !
aaah !
ohhhh !
don't tell leah , but sometimes i think that life would be a lot easier if i just looked like one of those tri pis .
i mean , do you know what it feels like to be a constant butt of jokes?
i do .
do you know what it feels like to be called a freak , to be humiliated day in , day out until your self esteem is so low , you'd you'd walk a mile out of your way just to avoid looking in a mirror?
or to be . . . peer pressured into crushing hundreds of cans of beer on your head for nine years . . . despite the constant migraines and the expensive c a t scans?
roberta . . .
we love you .
ohh ...
my giant .
my gentle giant .
i feel like ... you girls are my best friends in the whole world .
a and i think it's time . . . we stopped moping around . . . and started having fun .
what kind of fun?
so so why do they call it a gravity bong?
i have no idea .
oh , that tickles .
stop that now .
stop it .
did you leave a boyfriend or anything back in minnesota?
oh , no , no .
my father didn't want me to date boys .
oh .
sounds really controlling .
he is .
he expects me to graduate , buy a house in the suburbs , and be part of his old boy network .
that's really . . . strange .
well , uh . . .
daisy , i think you deserve better than that .
i mean , the only way you're ever gonna be happy is if you're true to what you want .
your dad's just gonna have to accept that you have to make your own choices in life .
you know , you're right .
you are .
god !
do you hear that?
i'm so sick of those stupid frats and their stupid music !
oh , oh , oh your toes .
