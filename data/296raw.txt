whoo hoo !
zatarra , the boat cannot hold no more , and there are at least eight more boatloads down there !
do you not understand?
you are wealthier than any man i have ever heard of .
whatever your problems were , they are over .
what do you want to buy?
revenge .
okay , revenge .
who?
danglars , villefort ,
fernand and mercedes .
right .
we kill these people , then we spend the treasure .
no , we will study them , learn their weaknesses .
why not just kill them?
i'll do it .
i'll run up to paris bam , bam , bam , bam !
i'm back before week's end .
we spend the treasure .
how is this a bad plan?
death is too good for them .
they must suffer as i suffered .
they must see their world , all they hold dear , ripped from them as it was ripped from me .
you will need a better name than zatarra if you are to accomplish that .
then i shall become a count .
i bid you good afternoon , sir .
i'm here to purchase your lovely home .
the very cheek !
i shall have you horsewhipped !
now , get off my property , you vagabond , before i set the dogs on you , you hear?
thank you .
ladies and gentlemen , it is with great honor that i present to you his grace , the count of monte cristo .
it's so beautiful .
greetings .
my dear count , allow me to introduce to you my husband ,
monsieur villefort , chief prosecutor .
very kind of you to think of us .
oh , i am the one honored with your presence .
now , please , enjoy yourselves tonight .
what do we know about him?
not enough .
where are they?
are you sure you invited them?
yes , your grace .
but i just learned that count mondego has retired for the evening .
he has a morning appointment he cannot miss .
you're up early , my dear .
is the viscount tourville dead?
unless his heart is situated somewhere other than the left side of his chest ,
i suspect he is .
god grant him peace .
he did no more than defend his family's honor .
much good it did him .
his wife and i were happy in our passion .
you were happy in your ignorance .
now comes the viscount's valiant defense of his honor , and you are pained .
she is ruined , and he is dead .
don't flatter yourself .
i was neither happy nor ignorant , having known about the last three women before madame tourville .
i'm sorry you are humiliated .
the combination of paris and me is hardly a recipe for fidelity .
and since my attempts at discretion have evidently failed , there seems little point in keeping up pretenses .
it's actually quite ...
liberating .
wouldn't you say?
his finances?
he's losing money at the other casinos .
they're not even cheating him .
have you looked into his shipping?
he got a bank loan for his own boat several years ago .
doesn't use danglars .
make sure we own that bank by tomorrow .
tell the other shipping companies to stay away from mondego .
i want to give him no choice but to crawl back to danglars .
now , tell the dealers take it all .
do try to understand .
i have a very large consignment of cotton ready to be sent , and i shall make my payment on the ship as soon as it is delivered .
so obviously i need the vessel in order to deliver it .
unfortunately , the bank can offer no further extensions , count mondego .
i suggest you find alternate means of shipping .
well , well .
to what do i owe the honor , count mondego?
can't imagine why you've been avoiding me after all these years .
i'm prepared to overlook your faults ... and perhaps resume our dealings .
business not going so well these days?
zatarra?
jacopo .
did you fall off the bed?
after 13 years of sleeping on a stone slab , i can't .
mi maria .
does that hurt?
did you come here for a reason?
mondego has a son .
albert wishes to talk with us .
not now !
tell him i'm trying to protect his inheritance .
are you afraid he's going to squander his as you have yours?
i don't recall hearing your complaints when i elevated you from a fishmonger's daughter .
please , i must finish this , then i shall be going out .
may i remind you , my love , that in paris there are mistresses aplenty , but you have only one son .
come in , albert .
for god's sake , be brief .
i will , father .
several of my friends are going to rome for two weeks during carnival .
i would like to accompany them .
rome?
and no chaperons?
you're only 15 .
almost 16 .
make it my birthday present , father , please .
i won't get into trouble .
no .
of course he can go .
i could do with some peace and quiet around here .
rome !
albert ! albert !
over here !
over here !
over here !
milady?
can't hide forever .
milady?
who are you , and why are you doing this?
we are bad men , and for the money .
my money is in my waistcoat .
not anymore .
besides , it's not your money we're interested in .
you are the only son of count mondego , are you not?
ransom?
send your note and be damned .
i wish it were that easy , but a note won't reach your father for two weeks , and then there's the endless debates about whether we killed you already .
no , a note just doesn't have the impact .
perhaps if we send him your ring .
yes .
my ring bears the mondego crest .
while still attached to your finger?
listen to me , vermin .
i am albert , son of fernand , count mondego , and you have had your last laugh at my expense .
do your worst .
if you insist .
peppone , the knife .
cut this boy's ropes , or i will be forced to start cutting your miserable corpses .
now !
follow me , young man .
you see the surface?
wait for me there .
i don't know how to thank you .
go .
we'll talk later .
well done , gentlemen .
many thanks , your grace .
albert .
are you all right?
sir , i owe you my life .
you've had quite an ordeal .
you're an extraordinary young man .
i insist , you must come to my estate for breakfast tomorrow .
agreed?
agreed .
may i ask who you are , sir?
for the present , your friend .
tomorrow , your host .
for the short time formality stands between us , the count of monte cristo .
he's out in the waiting room .
he showed courage in the tunnels .
he's a means to an end .
yes , your grace .
young man .
albert , come in .
come , come .
come on .
you've had quite a night .
yes .
what an adventure .
everything's an adventure when you're young .
one thing puzzles me , sir .
hmm .
how did you come to know of my kidnapping?
i have many connections , some of which are less than reputable .
i pay well to be informed of anything of note in any city in which i stay .
and the kidnapping of a count's son is of note .
but why risk your life rescuing me?
the son of a fellow noble .
it was the least i could do .
judging by your character , i'm sure you would have done the same .
your father will be proud of you .
you must come to paris and meet my parents so they may thank you in person .
unfortunately , i cannot .
business , you see .
please , it is a matter of honor .
jacopo?
yes , your grace?
the spada matter where do we stand?
even now , the gold  the shipment?
oh , l i'm sorry , your grace .
the shipment is in transit , uh , bound for marseilles .
and it arrives?
not for another three weeks , your grace .
three weeks?
that's more than enough time to visit in paris .
very well .
excellent .
and you'll be there just in time .
in time for?
happy birthday .
thanks .
the count of monte cristo .
count !
albert .
your grace .
father !
may i present the count of monte cristo .
'tis a pleasure .
the pleasure is mine , count mondego .
i've been looking forward to this moment for some time .
you do me much honor , when it is i who are indebted to you ... for the rescue of my son .
may i present the countess mondego .
mercedes .
countess .
you would have to be a mother to truly appreciate the service ... you've done for my son and me .
monsieur , i shall never forget you .
please , madame , it was nothing .
i am sure that within a month , you will not even remember my name .
hmm?
may i steal your wife?
i'm sorry?
for the waltz .
of course .
isn't he wonderful , father?
what's the matter?
uh , nothing .
you just remind me of someone from long ago , someone who was very dear to me .
i'm flattered .
what happened to him?
he died .
but i'm not that man .
monsieur and madame villefort .
what are they doing here?
prosecutor villefort .
what are you doing here?
oh , madame villefort , monsieur .
i'm so glad you could come to see me while i'm still in town .
we were delightfully surprised to get your note .
thank you .
would you be so kind as to excuse your husband and i for a moment?
i'm told you are an expert in the interpretation of the law .
i have a certain matter that perhaps you could help me with .
excuse me .
fernand .
fernand !
the toast !
not right now .
i have state business to attend to .
our guests expect it .
albert expects it .
you give it , my dear .
i'm sure it'll be splendid .
you are his father !
it is the least you can do .
you know how he admires you .
then he will forgive my absence .
but
i thought we agreed not to meet socially .
how could i pass up the count of monte cristo?
quite .
what do you know of him?
he's foreign , rich .
i hear he aided your son .
why does he seek your counsel?
why should i tell you?
when my son returned from rome , he mentioned he'd heard monte cristo saying he was expecting a shipment .
he also heard the words " gold " ... and ``spada .
hmm .
you don't believe
monte cristo has found the treasure of spada .
not an hour ago , he asked me to help him avoid troublesome inspections ... on a shipment coming from marseilles .
hmm .
i could have him arrested .
don't do that .
let's just relieve him of it .
how do you propose  i have an acquaintance who deals in these matters .
tell monte cristo you'll get his shipment through customs , but that it will have to stay in port overnight .
i shall have it removed and taken to my old family estate in bouchon , where we shall meet the following day .
i require 70 percent .
and yet you'll only get 50 .
done .
yes , it is , isn't it?
yes , well , i know .
yes .
ladies and gentlemen , unfortunately , my husband has been detained by business .
and so it is left up to me to
to introduce you ... to the count of monte cristo yet again .
you see , i had the audacity to beg the count ... to allow me to give the birthday toast to albert .
i was so insistent , and such is the graciousness of our host , that he reluctantly gave up his fatherly right ... in order to accommodate a guest , even one as boorish as myself .
ahh .
young albert has made far too much ... of the assistance i gave him in rome .
when i arrived in the catacombs ,
i watched as the criminals , who tied albert to a wall , threatened to cut off his finger and send it to his father ... as evidence of his abduction .
goodness !
the boy's reply to all this was ... ``do your worst .
life is a storm , my young friend .
you will bask in the sunlight one moment , be shattered on the rocks the next .
what makes you a man ... is what you do when that storm comes .
you must look into that storm and shout , as you did in rome , ``do your worst ... for i will do mine .
then the fates will know you as we know you , as albert mondego , the man .
giddap !
edmond , villefort told me that you were executed .
did he?
oh , god .
countess , you are mistaken .
back to the mondegos '.
no !
madame , i'm only thinking of your reputation .
i beg you , edmond .
i don't care how you returned .
i am not this edmond .
stop it !
stop it !
stop it !
so , what are you?
a spirit?
some ghost sent to torment me?
this edmond , you loved him?
yes .
for how long?
for all of my life .
and how long after he died before you married the count?
that isn't fair .
we've reached your home , countess .
you're right .
you cannot be my edmond .
well , there you are .
you said it yourself .
edmond dantes is dead .
good night .
countess .
if you ever again presume to interfere in my affairs ,
i will , i promise , finish the job i started the day we met .
do you understand?
i understand you are mad .
mad?
my enemies are falling into my traps perfectly .
you have a fortune , a beautiful woman who loves you .
take the money , take the woman and live your life .
stop this plan .
take what you have won .
i can't .
why not?
i am still your man , zatarra .
i swore an oath .
i will protect you .
even if it means i must protect you from yourself .
i'll drive you home now .
i'll walk .
put two chests on the pharaon for our cut .
mondego will never notice .
come on .
get aboard .
philippe danglars?
yeah?
you are charged with the theft of goods from a certain merchant ship .
this is absurd .
we can resolve this matter easily .
these men will perform a search of your vessel .
count mondego set me up .
but i'll not hang for him .
who are you?
i'm the count of monte cristo .
but my friends call me edmond dantes .
dantes?
cut him down before he can't talk .
boy , don't do that .
that's that's too much .
my dear villefort .
i hope you don't mind if i join you for a short while .
your grace , i was not expecting you .
i want to thank you in person for helping me with my shipment .
that , yes . l i made all the arrangements earlier .
i can promise you there'll be no more problems from our end .
excellent .
i think this could be the start of a long and fruitful relationship .
speaking of which , may i pose a question?
yes , of course .
anything in the world .
i was just curious .
why did you tell countess mondego 16 years ago ... that edmond dantes had been executed?
hmm?
uh , i don't understand .
wh what on earth are you talking about?
it's a perfectly simple question .
how do you know these things?
that's , uh
that's quite enough .
whew !
you don't understand .
dantes was accepting a letter from napoleon .
that was clearly treason .
but we both know he never delivered it .
packing a man off to prison with such knowledge is bad enough .
but to tell
your grace , i have no idea what is provoking this perverse discussion .
now i ask myself , ``what did my old friend villefort stand to gain ... by telling mercedes that edmond dantes is dead?
the answer is ... absolutely nothing .
just as you say , nothing .
so why
but if my old friend , now chief prosecutor of france , doesn't gain from this lie , well , who does?
my dear count , it's far too hot in here and you're fully dressed .
it's time we both left .
i think the clearest beneficiary ... is fernand , count mondego .
i don't understand what this inquisition has to do with our business relationship .
i'm about to tell you .
sit down , mondego .
i'm an ambitious man .
and i have furthered these ambitions ... by scooping up bonapartists .
but now with napoleon on the loose , i have , shall i say , a thorn in my side .
once merely an irritation , now potentially lethal .
be lethal in turn .
well , the problem is such ... that i , myself , cannot attend to it .
so i have a proposition for you .
how is your father?
alive , unfortunately .
we share the same misfortune .
you remember?
why is this door locked?
i demand that you release me from this room at once .
you've proved yourself no friend of mine .
your father was a loyal supporter of napoleon , wasn't he?
possibly involved in plotting napoleon's escape from elba .
the emperor arrives soon !
an inconvenient parent for an ambitious civil servant .
but then he died , suddenly and opportunely murdered , again some 16 years ago .
the emperor napoleon .
the murderer never apprehended .
how hard did you look for him?
you have no proof , no witnesses .
you just have theories .
j just conjectures .
on the contrary .
i have count mondego .
young mondego .
why?
because your son lacked the courage .
mondego is the one who pulled the trigger !
he'd never confess in a million years !
you're right , he wouldn't .
but you just have .
monsieur villefort , you are under arrest for conspiracy to murder .
you remember?
dantes?
a courtesy for a gentleman .
you didn't think i'd make it that easy , did you?
hyah !
edmond?
i thought we had finished our conversation in the carriage .
so did i.
until i realized ... you said the name ``dantes .
a name that i had never mentioned .
what do you want of me?
i want to be free of you , the way you obviously are free of me .
just a few answers from you , and i shall be gone forever .
ask your questions .
where have you been?
thirteen years in the chateau d'lf ... and everywhere else you can imagine .
the chateau d'lf for 13 years .
did you suffer?
are you finished now?
i have a good deal on my mind .
what happened afterward?
much .
why did you not come to me?
why did you not wait?
you married the very man who betrayed
i told you that night on the rocks , remember?
that it would never leave my finger .
and it never has .
why?
you know why .
if you ever loved me , don't don't rob me of my hate .
it's all i have .
let it go , edmond .
let it go .
i don't know what dark plan lies within you .
nor do i know by what design we were asked ... to live without each other these 16 years .
but god has offered us a new beginning  god?
don't slap his hand away .
can i never escape him?
no .
he is in everything .
even in a kiss .
my lady?
where's the count?
um , the count would like for you to join him this afternoon .
join him?
uh , yes , in , uh , leaving the country with your son .
mmm , uh , i'll have someone bring you to your house ... and you just wait there for me .
and we just  thank you !
yes , yes , but  i need to go home and pack .
yes , yes .
my lady
where's the count?
upstairs , my lady .
what's wrong?
i'm bankrupt .
all my debts have been called in .
also , i'm to be arrested .
for what?
piracy , corruption and murder .
did you do all these things?
yes .
there is simply not time to talk .
the gendarmes are on the way , apparently , so hurry up and pack something .
i'm not going with you , fernand .
you are my wife .
i have made arrangements for us .
we shall be very well taken care of .
now go and find my son .
he's not your son .
i beg your pardon?
albert mondego is the son of edmond dantes .
why do you think i rushed off so quickly to marry you after edmond was taken away?
premature .
well , aren't you a piece of work .
so he's the bastard son of a dead traitor .
he always was disappointing .
good bye , mercedes .
you did please me some of the time .
you never pleased me .
what is this?
monte cristo .
king's to you , fernand .
edmond?
but how
how did i escape?
with difficulty .
how did i plan this moment?
with pleasure .
so you've taken mercedes?
and everything else ... except your life .
why are you doing this?
it's complicated .
let's just say it's vengeance for the life you stole from me .
well , i see someone has taught you the sword .
how did you ever call yourself my friend?
we were friends , edmond .
you sent me to hell !
why?
take your vengeance .
but know the blood you spill is noble .
blood that will never run through your veins .
you're no more a count than i am a commoner !
you don't have it in you .
touch him , and i'll kill you .
boy , let me explain .
it's been explained .
i spoke to madame villefort on the street .
she told me how i was a silly , trusting dupe that my friend , the count of monte cristo , used to get into our lives .
albert , listen to me .
i will not !
forgive me for being such a fool , father .
you were betrayed .
of course you're forgiven .
you were my friend .
i looked up to you .
there's a history here you know nothing about .
he loved your mother , and yet she chose me .
now he intends to steal her away .
lie .
get out of my way !
boy , if i have to , i will kill you .
i will not stop now .
nor will i.
so be it .
no !
albert ,
i found the note you left explaining where you'd gone .
but now i must explain something to you .
where you really come from .
albert, you are the son of edmond dantes .
the man you know as the count of monte cristo .
well , i'm afraid it is true .
you are the walking proof that your mother was as much of a whore ... in her younger years as she is today .
you
you let me fight him?
it didn't do any good though , did it?
fernand , i beg you .
no more !
i want no more of this .
just go .
call it mercy .
mercy , fernand .
you've only got one shot , and it will take more than that to stop me .
well , then i'd best put it where it will do the most damage .
no !
mother !
mother !
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
look what i've done . jacopo !
hyah !
once again , zatarra ,
god sees you out of the corner of his eye .
she'll live .
edmond !
edmond !
please don't go out there .
don't .
edmond , don't go .
you try .
don't ever quit .
zatarra , you must end this .
even the priest will understand that .
edmond !
please don't leave .
watch over your mother .
now , i couldn't live in a world where you have everything and i have nothing .
what happened to your mercy?
i'm a count , not a saint .
you were right , priest .
you were right .
all that was used for vengeance ... will now be used for good .
so rest in peace , my friend .
so , zatarra , painful , huh?
no .
i bought this place , thinking one day i would tear it down .
but now the only things i care about ... are walking off this island with me .
