so that's a texas funeral?
yep .
i have to give it to ya , budd .
that's a pretty fucked up way to die .
what's the name on the grave she's buried under?
paula ... ... schultz .
can i look at the sword?
that's my money right there in that red bag , isn't it?
it sure is .
well then , it's your sword now .
what's that you said?
so this is a hattori hanzo sword?
that's a hanzo sword , all right .
bill tells me you once had one of these of your own .
yeah , once .
yeah?
how does this one compare to that?
if you're gonna compare a hanzo sword ... ... you compare it to every other sword ever made wasn't made by hattori hanzo .
here you go .
wrap your lips around that .
so ... ... which " r " are you filled with?
what?
they say ... ... the number one killer ... ... of old people ... ... is retirement .
people got a job to do , they tend to live a little bit longer so they can do it .
i've always figured that ... ... warriors and their enemies ... ... share the same relationship .
so now that you're not gonna have to face your enemy no more on the battlefield ... ... which " r " ya filled with?
relief ... ... or regret?
a little bit of both .
horseshit .
i'm sure you do feel a little bit of both .
but i know damn well that you feel one ... ... more than you feel the other .
which one is it?
regret .
you know , you gotta hand it to the ol 'girl .
i never saw anybody buffalo bill the way she buffaloed bill .
bill thought she was so damn smart .
and i tried to tell him ... ... she was just smart for a blond .
thanks a bunch .
all right .
mmm .
i'm sorry , budd .
that was rude of me , wasn't it?
budd , i'd like to introduce my friend , the black mamba .
black mamba , this is budd .
you know , before i picked that little fella up ,
i looked him up on the internet .
fascinating creature , the black mamba .
in africa , the saying goes ,
'in the bush , an elephant can kill you , a leopard can kill you ,
'and a black mamba can kill you .
but only with the mamba ,
and this has been true in africa since the dawn of time , is death sure . '
hence its handle , 'death incarnate . " 'pretty cool , huh?
lts neurotoxic venom is one of nature's most effective poisons ,
acting on the nervous system , causing paralysis .
the venom of a black mamba can kill a human being in four hours
if , say , bitten on the ankle or the thumb .
however , a bite to the face or torso can bring death from paralysis within 20 minutes .
now , you should listen to this , 'cause this concerns you .
the amount of venom that can be delivered from a single bite can be gargantuan .
you know , i've always liked that word , " gargantuan .
i so rarely have an opportunity to use it in a sentence .
if not treated quickly with antivenom ,
ten to 15 milligrams can be fatal to human beings .
however , the black mamba can deliver as much as 100 to 400 milligrams of venom from a single bite .
now ... ... in these last agonizing minutes of life you have left ,
let me answer that question you asked earlier more thoroughly .
right at this moment ... ... the biggest " r " i feel is regret .
regret that maybe the greatest warrior i have ever met met her end at the hands of a bushwhackin ', scrub , alkie , piece of shit like you .
that woman deserved better .
bill ... ... i have some tragic news .
your brother's dead .
i am so sorry , baby .
she put a black mamba in his camper .
i got her , sweetie .
she's dead .
you ever start feeling sentimental , go to barstow , california .
when you get here , walk into a florist and buy a bunch of flowers .
then you take those flowers to huntington cemetery on fuller and guadalupe , look for the headstone marked " paula schultz , " and lay them on the grave .
'cause you will be standing at the final resting place of beatrix kiddo .
marty kitrosser?
here .
melanie harrhouse?
here .
beatrix kiddo?
here .
look ...
i can be there in about four hours .
do you want me to come over?
no , no , no , no .
you need me , baby , i'm there .
ok .
i'm leaving now .
you go smoke some pot or somethin ', i'll be there soon .
ugh .
gross .
hi ya !
to my brother , budd .
the only man i ever loved .
bill .
what's that?
budd's hanzo sword .
he said he pawned it .
guess that makes him a liar now , don't it?
elle?
bea .
somethin 'i've always been curious about .
just between us girls ... ... what did you say to pai mei to make him snatch out your eye?
ow !
i called him a miserable old fool .
ooh .
bad idea .
know what i did?
i killed that miserable old fool .
how do you like the fish head , you miserable old fool?
i poisoned his fish heads .
elle , you treacherous dog .
i give you my word ...
and i told him ,
to me , the word of an old fool like you is worth less than nothing .
that's right .
i killed your master .
and now i'm gonna kill you , too .
with your own sword , no less .
which , in the very immediate future , will become my sword .
bitch ... ... you don't have a future .
fucking bitch !
fucking bitch !
i'll kill you !
you're fuckin 'dead !
you bitch !
you bitch !
i'll fucking kill you , you bitch !
oh , i'll get you !
i'm gonna ...
where are you?
lemme fuckin 'at you !
where are you?
i'm coming , you fucking bitch !
you're fucking dead !
you're dead !
oh ... shit !
like most men who never knew their father ,
bill collected father figures .
the first was esteban vihaio .
esteban was a pimp and a friend of bill's mother .
he ran a brothel in acuna , mexico for over 50 years .
his army , the acuna boys , made up of the fatherless offspring of his whores , ran acuna .
he ran the acuna boys .
now , at the age of 80 , it would be this retired gentleman of leisure who could point me in bill's direction .
seor esteban vihaio?
yes .
may i join you?
only on the condition that you call me esteban .
may i join you , esteban?
please .
americana?
yes .
i speak a little spanish , if you prefer .
no , no , no , no .
i prefer english .
i haven't spoken it in a while , but i would relish the opportunity to converse with such a pretty companion as yourself .
it's my pleasure to be in the company of such a fine gentleman as yourself .
i must warn you , young lady ... ... i am susceptible to flattery .
how may i be of service to you?
where's bill?
ahh .
you must be beatrix .
i can see the attraction .
i remember when bill was only five years old , i took him to the movies .
it was a movie starring lana turner .
the postman always ring twice , with john garfields .
and whenever she would appear on the screen ,
bill would begin compulsively to suck his thumb to an obscene amount .
and i knew from this very moment , this boy was a fool for blonds .
mmm .
you know ... ... being a fool for a woman such as yourself ... ... is always the right thing to do .
if we had met when i was back in business ... ... you would have been my number one lady .
well , i'm flattered .
you goddamn well better be .
this ...
i heard you were driving a truck .
my pussy wagon died on me .
the pussy died .
hmm .
bill shot you in the head , no?
yes .
hmm .
i would have been much nicer .
i would have just cut your face .
you must forgive me .
please ... you have a drink with me .
clara !
coming .
dos aejo .
gracias .
what were we talking about?
bill .
where's bill?
where's bill .
yeah .
hmm .
bill is at the villa quatro , on the road to salina .
i will draw you a map .
bill is like a son to me .
do you know why i help you?
no .
because he would want me to .
now , that i don't believe .
ahh .
how else is he ever going to see you again?
freeze , mommy .
bang , bang !
oh !
oh !
she got us , b. b.
mommy got us .
oh , i'm dying !
i'm dying .
fall down , sweetheart .
mommy shot us .
but little did quickdraw kiddo know that little b. b. was only playing possum , due to the fact that she was impervious to bullets .
i am pervious to bullets , mommy .
hey , get back down there .
you're playing possum .
so , as the smirking killer advanced on what she thought was a bullet ridden corpse , that's when little b. b. fired .
bang , bang !
you're dead , mommy .
so die .
oh !
b. b.
oh !
b. b ...
i should've known .
you are ... the best .
oh , mommy .
don't die .
i was just playing .
i know .
i told her that you were asleep ... ... but that one day you'd wake up and come back to her .
and she asked me , " if mommy's been asleep since i was born , then how will she know what i look like?
to which i replied , " because mommy's been dreaming of you .
that's what i said .
did you dream of me?
i dreamed of you .
every single night , baby .
every single night .
i waited a long time for you to wake up , mommy .
now , let me look at you .
oh .
my , my , my , what a pretty little girl you are .
you're pretty too , mommy .
tell mommy what you said when i showed you her picture .
mnh mnh .
come on , shy girl .
mnh mnh .
come on .
you know what you said .
come on .
tell mommy .
it'll make her feel good .
come on .
mnh mnh .
yeah .
come on .
i said ...
i said ,
you're the most beautifulest woman i ever saw in the whole wide world .
that's the truth .
that's what she said .
b. b. , don't you think mommy has the prettiest hair in the whole wide world?
yes , i do .
matter of fact , it's better than pretty .
what's better than pretty?
mmm ...
gorgeous .
very good .
gorgeous .
mommy is gorgeous .
hmm .
you know , sweetie , mommy's kinda mad at daddy .
why , daddy?
were you being a bad daddy?
i'm afraid i was .
i was a real bad daddy .
our little girl learned about life and death the other day .
wanna tell mommy about what happened to emilio?
i killed him .
emilio was her goldfish .
emilio was my goldfiss .
she came running into my room , holding the fish in her hand and crying ,
daddy .
daddy .
emilio's dead .
and i said , " really?
that's so sad .
how did he die?
and what did you say?
i stepped on him .
actually , young lady , the words you so strategically used were ,
i accidentally stepped on him .
to which i queried ,
and just how did your foot accidentally find its way into emilio's fishbowl?
and she said , " no , no , no .
emilio was on the carpet when i stepped on him .
mmm .
the plot thickens .
and just how did emilio get on the carpet?
and mommy , you would've been so proud of her .
she didn't lie .
she said she took emilio out of his bowl ... ... and put him on the carpet .
and what was emilio doing on the carpet?
flapping .
and then you stomped on him .
uh huh .
and when you lifted up your foot ... ... what was emilio doing then?
nothing .
he stopped flapping , didn't he?
she told me later ... ... that the second she lifted up her foot and saw emilio not flapping , she knew what she had done .
is that not the perfect visual image of life and death?
a fish flapping on the carpet , and a fish not flapping on the carpet .
so powerful , even a four year old with no concept of life or death ... ... knew what it meant .
you loved emilio , didn't you?
uh huh .
well ...
i love mommy , too .
but i did to mommy what you did to emilio .
you stomped on mommy?
worse .
i shot mommy .
not pretend shooting like we were just doing .
i shot her for real .
why?
did you want to see what would happen?
no , i knew what would happen to mommy if i shot her .
what i didn't know was , when i shot mommy , what would happen to me .
what happened?
i was very sad .
and that's when i learned ... ... some things , once you do , they can never be undone .
what happened to mommy?
why don't you ask mommy?
you ok , mommy?
did it hurt?
no , sweetie .
doesn't hurt anymore .
did it make you sick?
no .
it made me sleep .
that's why i haven't been with you , b. b. i've been asleep .
but you're awake now , mommy .
right?
i'm wide awake , pretty girl .
b. b. , would you like mommy to watch a video with you before sleepy time?
uh huh .
mommy , do you wanna watch a video with me before sleepy time?
oh , yeah !
i would love to .
which one do you wanna watch?
shogun assassin .
no , b. b. shogun assassin is too long .
mnh mnh .
no , it's not .
well , then , i'll leave you ladies to it .
when i was little , my father was famous .
he was the greatest samurai in the empire .
and he was the shogun's decapitator .
he cut off the heads of 131 lords .
my father would come home to mother and when he would see her , he would forget about the killings .
he wasn't scared of the shogun , but the shogun was scared of him .
maybe that was the problem .
one night , the shogun sent ...
my man got a heart
like the rock that's in the sea
well , no one told me about her
the way she lied
well , no one told me about her
how many people cried
my man got a heart
like the rock that's in the sea
my man got a heart
like the rock that's in the sea
well , no one told me about her
the way she lied
well , no one told me about her
how many people cried
but it's too late to say you're sorry
how would i know?
why should i care?
please don't bother trying to find her
she's not there
i was just admiring your sword .
quite a piece of work .
speaking of which , how is hanzo san?
he's good .
has his sushi gotten any better?
you know , i couldn't believe it .
you got him to make you a sword .
it was easy .
i just dropped your name , bill .
that'd do it .
well , no one told me about her
well , no one told me about her
i suppose the idea is we cross hanzo swords .
am i right?
well , it just so happens this hacienda has its own private beach .
and that private beach just so happens to look particularly beautiful bathed in moonlight .
and there just so happens to be a full moon out tonight .
so , swordfighter , if you want a swordfight , that's where i suggest .
but if you wanna be old school about it ... ... and you know i'm all about old school ... ... then we could wait until dawn and slice each other up at sunrise
like a couple of real life honest ...
now , if you don't settle down , i'm gonna have to put one in your kneecap .
and i hear tell that's a very painful place to get shot in .
i'm just fuckin 'with you .
now ... ... when it comes to you ... ... and us ... ... i have a few unanswered questions .
so , before this tale of bloody revenge reaches its climax ,
i'm gonna ask you some questions , and i want you to tell me the truth .
however , therein lies a dilemma .
because when it comes to the subject of me ,
i believe you are truly and utterly incapable of telling the truth .
especially to me .
and least of all , to yourself .
and when it comes to the subject of me ,
i am truly and utterly incapable of believing anything you say .
how do you suppose we solve this dilemma?
well , it just so happens ,
i have a solution .
aah !
gotcha !
goddamn !
what the fuck did you just shoot me with?
my greatest invention .
or at least my favorite .
don't touch it , or i'll stick another one right in your cheek .
what lies within that dart , just begging to course its way through your veins ... ... is an incredibly potent and quite infallible truth serum .
i call it " the undisputed truth .
twice as strong as sodium pentothal , with no druggie aftereffects .
except for a slight wave of euphoria .
you feel it?
euphoria?
yeah .
no .
too bad .
as you know ... ... i'm quite keen on comic books .
especially the ones about superheroes .
i find the whole mythology surrounding superheroes fascinating .
take my favorite superhero , superman .
not a great comic book .
not particularly well drawn .
mmm .
but the mythology ...
the mythology is not only great , it's unique .
how long does this shit take to go into effect?
about two minutes .
just long enough for me to finish my point .
now , a staple of the superhero mythology is , there's the superhero and there's the alter ego .
batman is actually bruce wayne , spider man is actually peter parker .
when that character wakes up in the morning , he's peter parker .
he has to put on a costume to become spider man .
and it is in that characteristic superman stands alone .
superman didn't become superman .
superman was born superman .
when superman wakes up in the morning , he's superman .
his alter ego is clark kent .
his outfit with the big red " s " that's the blanket he was wrapped in as a baby when the kents found him .
those are his clothes .
what kent wears the glasses , the business suit that's the costume .
that's the costume superman wears to blend in with us .
clark kent is how superman views us .
and what are the characteristics of clark kent?
he's weak ... ... he's unsure of himself ... ... he's a coward .
clark kent is superman's critique on the whole human race .
sorta like beatrix kiddo and mrs. tommy plimpton .
aso .
the point emerges .
you would've worn the costume of arlene plimpton .
but you were born beatrix kiddo .
and every morning when you woke up , you'd still be beatrix kiddo .
oh , you can ... take the needle out .
are you calling me a superhero?
i'm calling you a killer .
a natural born killer .
you always have been , and you always will be .
moving to el paso ... ... working in a used record store ... ... goin 'to the movies with tommy ... ... clipping coupons .
that's you ... ... trying to disguise yourself as a worker bee .
that's you tryin 'to blend in with the hive .
but you're not a worker bee .
you're a renegade killer bee .
and no matter how much beer you drank or barbecue you ate or how fat your ass got , nothing in the world would ever change that .
did you really think your life in el paso was gonna work?
no !
but i would've had b. b. !
don't get me wrong .
i think you would have been a wonderful mother .
but you are a killer .
all those people you killed to get to me ... ... felt damn good , didn't they?
yes .
every single one of them?
yes .
that was the warmup round .
now comes the $64, 000 question .
why did you run away from me with my baby?
do you remember the last assignment you sent me on?
of course .
lisa wong .
the morning i left , i was sick .
on the plane , i threw up .
maybe i was pregnant .
easy to use .
remove cap and urinate on the absorbent end for five seconds .
accurate results in only 90 seconds .
you can read the results as soon as the line appears in the window .
fuck .
what i didn't know ... ... was that somewhere on my journey i had been spotted .
with me in l. a. , it didn't take lisa wong long to send an assassin of her own .
hello , can i help you?
hello , i'm karen kim .
i'm the hospitality manager of the hotel .
i have a welcome gift from the management .
oh , that's nice .
um ...
can you just leave it by the door?
you pretty good with that shotgun?
not that i have to be at this range , but i'm a fuckin 'surgeon with this shotgun .
well , guess what , bitch?
i'm better than annie oakley .
and i got you right in my sight .
i could blow your fuckin 'head off .
not before i put one right between your eyes , so let's talk .
karen ... ... i just found out ... ... right now ... ... not a moment before you blew a hole through the door ... ... that i'm pregnant .
what is this?
on the floor by the door ... ... is a strip that says i'm pregnant .
bullshit .
any other time you'd be 100 percent right .
this time ... ... you're 100 percent wrong .
i'm the deadliest woman in the world .
but right now ... ... i'm just scared shitless for my baby .
please .
just look at the strip .
please .
stay where you are and don't move .
i don't know what this fuckin 'shit means .
the box with the directions it's right there .
easy to use .
remove the cap and urinate on the absorbent end .
blue means pregnant .
i'll read it myself , thank you .
oh , ok .
say i were to believe you .
what then?
just go home .
i'll do the same .
congratulations .
before that strip turned blue ... ... i was a woman , i was your woman .
i was a killer who killed for you .
before that strip turned blue , i would've jumped a motorcycle onto a speeding train .
for you .
but once that strip turned blue ... ... i could no longer do any of those things .
not anymore .
because i was gonna be a mother .
can you understand that?
yes .
but why didn't you ... ... tell me then , instead of now?
once you knew , you'd claim her .
and i didn't want that .
not your decision to make .
yes .
but it's the right decision , and i made it for my daughter .
she deserved to be born with a clean slate .
but with you ... ... she would've been born into a world she shouldn't have .
i had to choose .
i chose her .
you know , five years ago , if i had to make a list of impossible things that could never happen , you performing a coup de grce on me by bustin 'a cap in my crown ... ... would've been right at the top of the list .
i'd have been wrong , wouldn't i?
i i'm sorry .
was that a question?
of impossible things that could never happen yes , in this instance , you would've been wrong .
well?
when you never came back ,
i naturally assumed lisa wong , or somebody else , had killed you .
oh !
and for the record ... ... letting somebody think somebody they love is dead when they're not is quite cruel .
i mourned you for three months .
and in the third month of mourning you ... ... i tracked you down .
i wasn't tryin 'to track you down .
i was tryin 'to track down the fucking assholes i thought killed you .
so i find you ... ... and what do i find?
not only are you not dead ... ... you're getting married to some fucking jerk .
and you're pregnant .
i overreacted .
you overreacted?
is that your explanation?
i didn't say i was gonna explain myself .
i said i was gonna tell you the truth .
but if that's too cryptic , let's get literal .
i'm a killer .
i'm a murdering bastard .
you know that .
and there are consequences ... ... to breaking the heart of a murdering bastard .
you experienced some of them .
was my reaction really that surprising?
yes .
it was .
could you do what you did?
of course you could .
but i never thought you would , or could , do that to me .
i'm really sorry , kiddo ... ... but you thought wrong .
you and i have unfinished business .
baby ... you ain't kiddin '.
pai mei taught you the five point palm exploding heart technique?
'course he did .
why didn't you tell me?
i don't know .
because i'm ... ... a bad person .
no .
you're not a bad person .
you're a terrific person .
you're my favorite person .
but every once in a while ... ... you can be a real cunt .
how do i look?
you look ready .
well , well , well .
if it ain't the little flower .
good evening , mr. and mrs. america and all the ships at sea .
let's go to press .
flash .
do you have a magpie in your home?
if you do , you are most fortunate .
the magpie is the most charming bird in all the world .
he is the best friend a farmer ever had .
treat him gently .
treat him kindly .
and always remember , the magpie deserves your respect .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
oh , thank you .

tacks on the floor , and the tvis on
and i always sleep with my guns

there's a blade by the bed
and a phone in my hand
a dog on the floor
and some cash on the nightstand
when i'm all alone , the dreaming stops
and i just can't stand

i'mjust a little baby
what if the lights go out and maybe
and then the windjust starts to moan
outside the door , he followed me home

if it's not here soon , i might be done
no , it won't be too soon 'til i say goodnight moon
well , you're up so high , how can you save me?
when the dark comes here tonight
to take me up to my front walk and into bed
where it kisses my face and eats my head
what should i do?
i'mjust a little baby
what if the lights go out and maybe
and then the windjust starts to moan
outside the door , he followed me home
now , goodnight moon , i want the sun
if it's not here soon , i might be done
no , it won't be too soon 'til i say goodnight moon
no , it won't be too soon 'til i say goodnight moon
and , action !
