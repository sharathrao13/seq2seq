i mean ...
you know what i'm saying , buddy?
oh , what a mess .

it's just a fact .
no offence !
but you barely know what i'm talking about .

carl .

come on , you're making a scene .
we'll just take our furry pinata and go .
would you mind?
hey .
buddy , if it's not them today , it's just someone else tomorrow .
i like rather not be today .
okay?
look .
we're gonnaa break your neck so you don't feel a thing .
how's that?
wait a minute .
i thought rhinos were vegetarians .
an excelent point .
shut up !
who says we gonna eat him after we kill him?
yeh , come on , move it .
you know , i don't like animals that kill for pleasure .
save it for a mammal that cares .
i'm a mammal that cares .
okay , look .
if either of you make it across that sink hole in front of you , you get the sloth .
that's right , you losers .
you take one step and you're dead .
you were bluffing , huh?
yeah , that was a bluff .
get him !
a dandelion?
we did it !
what?
you have beautiful eyes .
get off my face .
wow , you and me , we make a great team .
i mean .
what'd you say we just head south together?
great !
yeah , hey jump up on my back and relax your whole way .
wow .
really?
no .
wait , aren't you going to south?
the changing seasons , migration instincts?
any of this a ringin 'a bell?
i guess not , bye .
okay , then thanks for the help .
i can take it from here .
hey , you over grown weasel .
wait till we get down there .
ohohou .
that south thing is way overrated .
the heat , the crowd .
who needs any?
isn't this great?
you and me , two bachelors knockin 'about in the wild .
no , you just want a bodyguard so you don't become somebody's side dish .
you're very shrewd mammal .
can you lead the way , mr. big guy?
didn't get the name .
manfred .
manfred?
yuck .
how about manny the moody mammoth?
or manny the melancholy ...
manny the ...
stop following me .
ok , so you've got issues .
look , you won't even know i'm here .
i'll just zip the lip when i say ...
look at the cute little baby , diego .
isn't it nice if he'll be joining us for breakfast?
it wouldn't be breakfast without him .
especially since his daddy wiped out half our pack and wears our skin to keep warm .
an eye for an eye .
don't you think?
let's show that human what happens when he messes with sabers .
alert the troops .
we attack at dawn .
and diego , bring me that baby .
alive .
if i'm gonna enjoy my revenge , i want it to be fresh .
phew .
i'm wiped out .
that's your shelter?
hey .
you're a big guy .
you got a lot of wood .
i'm a little guy .
you've got half a stick .
yeah , but with my little stick , and my highly evolved brain ...
i shall create fire .
fascinating .
we'll see if brains triumph over brawn tonight .
now , won't we?
hey , i think i saw spark .
any chance i can squeeze in there with you manny?
old pal?
isn't there someone else you can annoy?
friends?
family?
poisonous reptiles?
my family abandoned me .
they just kinda migrated without me .
you should see what they did last year .
you know , i mean .
they woke up early and finely tied my hands and feet . and they gagged me with a fieldmouse , barricaded the cave door , and covered their tracks , went through water so i'd lose their scent , and ... who needs 'em , anyway?
so what about you?
you've family?
okay , you're tired , i see .
well , we'll talk more tomorrow in the morning .
au , au , a , a , au , au .
manfred?
manfred .
could you scooch over a drop?
come on , nobody falls asleep that fast .
manny !
there's diego , fall back !
where's the baby?
i've lost it over the falls .
you lost it?
i want that baby , diego .
i'll get it .
you'd better .
unless you want to serve yourself as the replacement .
we'll go up to half peak .
meet us there .
it'd better be alive .
can we trust you with that , diego?
let's go !
and then she picked this hair off my shoulder and says , look ...
if you're gonna have an extra mating dance , at least pick a female with the same color pelt , right?
and i thought , wow , she's gonna go praying mantis on me .
i mean , you know what i'm saying?
if you find a mate in life , you should be loyal .
in your case , grateful .
get away from me .
well , i think mating for life is stupid .
i mean there's plenty of sid to go around .
manny?
look at that .
he's okay .
she's gone .
hey , hey , hey manny , are you forgetting something?
no .
but you just saved him .
yeah , but i'm still trying to get rid of the last thing i saved .
you can't leave him here .
look , there's smoke .
that's his herd right up the hill .
we should return him .
let's get something straight here .
okay?
there's no " we " .
there never was a " we " .
in fact , without me , there wouldn't even be a " you " !
just up the hill .
listen very carefully .
i'm not g o i n g .
fine .
be a jerk .
i'll take care of him .
go .
yeah , that's good .
you'll take care ...
you can't even take care of yourself .
this i gotta see .
i'll return you .
we don't need that meany weeny mammoth , do we?
no , we don't .
you're the embarrassment of the nature , do you know that?
that is cake .
i'm fine .
i'm fine !
i'm gonna die .
that pink thing is mine .
no , actually that pink thing belongs to us .
us?
you two are a bit of an odd couple .
there is no " us " .
i see .
can't have one of your own , so you want to adopt .
look , i'm sorry to interrupt this snack .
but we gotta go .
the baby , please .
i was returning him to his herd .
oh , yeah .
nice try , bucktooth .
you're calling me a liar?
i didn't say that .
you were thinking it .
i don't like this cat .
he reads minds .
name is diego , friend .
manfred .
and i'm not your friend .
fine , manfred .
if you're looking for the humans , you're wasting your time .
they left this morning .
thanks for the advice .
now beat this .
all right , i'll help you bring it to its herd .
but promise me that you leave me alone after that .
okay , okay , deal .
what's your problem?
you're my problem .
but i think you're stressed .
that's why you eat so much .
i mean .
it's hard to get fat on a vegan diet .
i'm not fat .
it's all that fur .
it makes me look puffy .
all right , you have fat hair .
but when you're ready to talk , i'm here .
i don't know .
just drop it on the ledge .
shouldn't we make sure they found him?
good idea .
no , no , no !
wait .
wait .
don't spear me !
ohhhm .
this is a problem .
now what?
oh .
that's perfect .
i told you they were gone .
look who it is .
don't you have some poor defenseless animals to disembowel?
they couldn't be far .
i mean .
they went this way?
or this way?
you don't know much about tracking , do you?
hey , i'm a sloth .
i see a tree , either leaf , that's my tracking .
you didn't miss them by much .
it's still green .
they headed north 2 hours ago .
it's still green .
they headed north 2 hours ago .
you don't need this aggravation .
give me the baby .
i can track humans a lot faster than you can .
and you're just a good citizen helping out , right?
i just know where the humans are going .
glacier pass .
everybody knows they have a settlement on the other side .
well , unless you know how to track , you've never gonna reach them before the pass closes up with snow .
which should be like , tomorrow .
so you can give that baby to me or go get lost in the blizzard .
it's your choice .
here's your little bundle of joy .
we'll return it to the humans .
oooh .
the big bad tigey wigey get left behind .
poor tigey wigey ...
sid , tigey wigey is gonna lead the way .
manny , can i talk to you for a second?
no .
the sooner we find the humans , the sooner i get rid of mr. stinky drool face .
and the baby too .
you won't always have jumbo around to protect you .
and when that day comes , i suggest you watch your back .
cause i'll be chewing on it .
hey , human tracker , up front where i can see you .
help me .
you gotta make it stop .
i can't take it anymore !
i've eaten things that didn't complain this much .
he won't stop squirming .
you're holding it wrong .
watch its head !
just put it down !
jeez , 'pick him up , put him down , make him ... '
its nose's dry .
that means something is wrong with it .
someone should lick it .
just in case .
i'll do it .
hey , he's wearing one of those baby thingies .
so?
so if it poops , where does it go?
humans are disgusting .
okay , you .
check for poop .
hey .
why am i the poop checker?
because returning him home was your idea .
because you're small and insignificant .
and because i'll pummel you if you don't .
why else?
now , sid !
yuhh .
yuck .
yuhh .
i mean , my goodness .
all right , look out , look out .
coming through .
watch out !
stop waving that thing around !
oh , i'm gonna slip !
it's clean !
got you !
would you cut it out !
hey , do that again .
he likes it .
it's makin 'me feel better too .
here , you hold it .
turn him towards me .
where is the baby?
there it is !
where is the baby?
there it is !
stop it !
you're scaring him !
i bet he's hungry .
how about some milk?
uhh .
i'd love some .
not you , the baby .
well i ain't exactly lactating right now , pal .
you're a little low on the food chain to ... aren't you?
enough !
food !
i don't know , but i've been told ...
i don't know , but i've been told ...
end of the world be mighty cold ...
prepare for the ice age !
protect the dodo way of life !
survivals separate the dodos from the beasts .
ice age?
i've heard of these crackpots .
intruders !
don't fall in .
if you do , you'll definitely ...
intruders !
intru ...
uaaaa .
uuuuuuuh .
burn and die .
hey , can we have our melon back?
junior is hungry and ...
no way !
this is our private stockpile for the ice age .
subarctic temperatures will force us underground for a billion years .
so you've got three melons?
if you weren't smart enough to plan ahead , then doom on you .
doom on you !
doom on you !
get away from me !
oh !
no !
retrieve the melon !
taikwondoodos !
taikwondoodos !
attack !
the melon !
there goes our last female .
got it , got it , got it .
don't got it .
the last melon !
aghhh .
sid !

right , right , right .
hey , look at that .

frustrated diego .
tracking down helpless infants too difficult for you?
what are you two doing here?
soto's getting tired of waiting .
yeah .
yeah .
he said , come back with the baby , or don't come back at all !
well , i have a message for soto .
tell him , i'm bringing the baby .
and tell him , i'm bringing a mammoth .
a mammoth .
mammoths never travel alone .
well , this one does .
and i'm leading him to half peak .
look at all that meat .
let's get him !

you lost it?
sid !
it's so ugly .
positively adorable .
hello , pumpkin .

sabers were closing in on him .
so i just snatched him .
oh .
so brave .
yeh .
well , he needed me and i only wish i have one of my own .

he's not much to look at but it's so hard to find a family guy .
tell me about it .
all the sensitive ones get eaten .
no , no , no .
manny , please , i'm begging you .
i need him .
why?
a good looking guy like you?
no .
you say that , but you don't mean it .
no , seriously , look at you .
those ladies , they don't stand a chance .
we have a very cruel sense of humour .
hey .
don't let me cramp your style .
oh .
thanks , manny .
you're pal .
you are the best .
without pinky .
manny , manny , i need him .
so , ladies , where were we?
carl?

and that tiger .
yeah , mr. great tracker .

what am i?
the wet nurse?
what are you lookin 'at , bone bag?
look at you .
you gonna grow in a great predator , huh?
i don't think so .
what do you got?
you got a little ... patch of fur , no fang , no claws .
you're folds of skin wrapped in mush .
what's so threatening about you?
hey , does this look like a petting zoo to you?
huh?
okay .
all right , wise guy .
you just earned a time out .
oh you think that's funny?
how about this?
you'll be a little snack for the owls .
you're a brave little squirt , i'll give you that .

what do you mean short cut?
i mean faster that the long way around .

this time tomorrow you could be a free mammoth .
or a nanny . personally i never get tired of peekaboo .
hey guys .

tell the kid to be more careful .
look , look .

somebody pinch me .
hey , hey this fat one .
looks just like you .
oh , he's got a family .
oh , he's happy .
look he is playing with his kid .
see manny that's your problem .
that's what mammoths supposed to do .
sid .
find a she mmoth , have the little baby mammoth ...
sid !
what?
shut up !
well .
would you look at that .
the tiger actually did it .
there's half peak .
next stop .
glacier pass .
how could i ever have doubted you?
did you hear that little fella?
you are almost home?
my feet are sweating .
do we have to get a news flash every time your body does something?
don't pay attention .
just ignore him
seriously , my feet are really hot ...
tell me that was your stomach .
i am sure it was just thunder .
from under .. , ground?
come on keep up with me .
i would if you were moving .
wow .
i wish i could jump like that .
wish granted .
come on move faster .
have you noticed the river of lava?
hold pinky !
manny !!!
manny , manny , manny are you ok?
come on , come on say something .
anything !
what .
what?
i can't hear you .
you are standing on my trunk .
are you ok?
why did you do that?
you could have die trying to save me .
that's what you do in a herd ...
we look out for each other .
well ... thanks .
i don't now how about you guys , but ... we're the weirdest herd i've ever seen .
i can't wait to get my claws in that mammoth .
no one touches the mammoth until i get that baby .
first , i'm gonna slice its hind quarters into sections .
i'm on to put the white meat in one pile and dark in ano ...
hey .
knock it off .
i am starving .
next , the shoulders .
occasionally tough , but extremely juicy .
i told you to knock it off !
save your energy !
mammoths don't go down easy .
there is only one way to do it .
first you have to force it into a corner .
cut off his retreat .
and when you three have it trapped ...
i'll go for the throat .
guys .
we gotta get this kid out of the wind .
how much further?
3 miles .
i'm beat .
we'll get there in the morning .
what're you doing?
i'm putting sloth on the map .
hey .
why don't you make it realistic and draw him lying down?
and make him rounder .
perfect .
i forgot how to laugh .
i am a genius .
from now one you'll have to refer to me as ...
sid , lord of the flame .
hey , lord of the flame , your tail's on fire .
thank you .
from now one i'm gonna call you diego .
lord you've touched me and you are dead .
i am just kidding you little knuckle head .
hey lovebirds .
look at this .
i don't believe it .
come here , you little biped .
come here , you little wormy worm .
come to uncle sid .
no no this way , this way .
no . no , no .
go to him .
go to him .
ok ...
good job .
keep practising .
look at that .
our little guy is growing up .
come on .
sleep time .
lumpy .
look at that big pushover .
you know diego , i've never had a friend who'd risk his life for me .
yeah , manny's ... is a good guy .
yeah he is .
well , good night
all right .
let's get you all cleaned up .
i mean what's your daddy gonna say when we go back smudgy and stinky like this?
ok .
let me just clean that up .
that looks good and little bit here ...
you clean up nice little fellow .
i think he start to look like me .
hey diego , what do you say?
maybe we shouldn't do this .
why not?
because if we save him , he'll grow up to be a hunter .
and who do you think he'll hunt?
maybe because we save him he won't hunt us .
au !
yeh , maybe he'll grow fur and a long skinny neck and call you mamma !
what is your problem?
nothing .
lets go , it's freezing my tail off .
hey diego you've frozen back there .
get down .
what?
shhh !
get down and follow me .
hey , hey !
what's going on?
at the bottom of half peak ... there is an ambush waiting for you .
what?
what do you mean ambush .
you set us up?
it was my job , i was supposed to get the baby but then ...
you brought us home for dinner !!!
that's it , you're out of the herd .
i am sorry .
no you are not .
not yet .
listen , i can help you .
stay close sid .
we can fight our way out .
you can't .
pack's too strong .
you have to trust me !
trust you?
why in the world would we trust you?
because i am your only chance .
hello ladies !
hey look who decided to show up .
diego .
i was beginning to worry about you .
no need to worry .
in about 2 minutes you'll be satisfying your taste ... for revenge .
very nice !
i see the sloth !
and he's got the baby !
don't give away your positions until we see the mammoth .
he's the one we have to surprise .
you wanna maul something .
don't you think?
i wanna maul .
then what are you waiting for?
no , i said wait for the mammoth !
yohou !
backscratcher .
ahaa !
eat my powder !
loop de loop .
slalom , slalom baby !
sorry fellas , it got a little frostbite .
get him !

ok , follow me .
we'll pick up sid and get outta here while we can .
come on diego , let's bring this mammoth down .
there he is .
that's right where's the baby .
oh !
survival of the fittest .
i don't think so .
yeah !
what are you doing?
leave the mammoth alone !
fine !
i'll take you down first .
we did it !
