ok .
just this once .
yeah !
all right .
give me some clues .
it's round , but not always around .
it's light sometimes , dark sometimes , or both .

that is a hard one .
tell me about it .
the moon !
correct .
good job .
all right .
come on .
see you monday .
bye , frank .
thanks .
keep your snacks in the kitchen .
bye , mom .
he's really taken to you in the month you've been with us .
likewise .
too bad you can't stay on when tony's back .
it was just a favour .
i don't usually do this sort of ajob .
i thought you were a professional driver .
a different kind of driving .
well , we're all gonna miss you when you're gone .
and ... thank you for what you did .
for what?
for turning the car around so that jack wouldn't have to see us fighting .
you really know kids , don't you?
i know fighting .
he hasn't seen jack in months , and when he gets back , all i hear is what i'm doing wrong .
you'd think that after being separated for a year that he would ...
i'm sorry .
you don't have to hear this .
it's ok .
for what it's won'th , i think you're doing a greatjob with jack .
thank you .
any time i can be of help , if there's anything you need .
that's really sweet of you , frank .
i might have to take you up on it .
i almost forgot .
i'm supposed to take jack to the doctor tomorrow morning for a checkup , but i'm organising a party for him , even though his birthday's not until next week .
so , while i decorate and his friends arrive , i was thinking , if you wouldn't mind ...
i'll take him .
i feel funny cutting into your weekend .
i'm just picking up a friend at the airport later on in the day .
that's nice .
what is?
the guys on security say you're a bit of a ioner .
um ...
so it's just nice to hear you have a friend .
he's not really a friend .
he's french .
i'll call you back .
audrey .
i'd like to finish our conversation .
if anything comes up before then , you have my cell .
nothing will come up , mrs billings .
audrey .
audrey .
yeah , hello?
confirmed for tomorrow .
9am .
tomorrow , 9am .
only change the driver'll be taking him , not the mother .
even better .
vasily?
is it stable?
yes , it's stable .
and the antidote?
see you tomorrow .
the drug enforcement ministers of six latin american countries arrived in miami for a summit meeting ...
yeah .
martin , frank .
1156 palmeadow .
i'm waiting for an express delivery .
that's what you told me 45 minutes ago .
i don't need anything else .
just the pizza .
i'm not paying for that ...
hi .
hi .
so , it's one medium pie , no mozzarella , extra olives and extra anchovies , which amounts to $11 . 95 .
i hope you're hungry .
you have no idea .
i apologise for the delay , sir .
mrs billings .
audrey .
audrey .
what are you doing?
what does it look like i'm doing?
have you been drinking?
a little .
you said if i needed anything .
i can't .
why?
because of who i am?
because of who i am .
i feel so lost .
so confused .
who isn't?
thank you , frank .
for the time and ... your respect .
i think it's what i needed the most .
bye .
am i gonna get a shot?
i don't know .
jeez .
we're not open yet .
i need to see the doctor immediately .
right .
dr koblin , if you'll come out here , please .
we have an issue .
you'll have to state the medical problem .
actually , my problem's not medical .
it's psychological .
yes , laura .
what seems to be the problem?
me .
i hate shots .
number one , there's no guarantee you're getting a shot .
there's no sense getting worked up over something that might not happen .
give me the news .
doctor said i'm cured .
frank , it hurts a lot .
i'd never let anyone hurt you a lot .
promise?
you know my fourth rule?
never make a promise you can't keep .
come on .
close the door .
come on .
may i help you?
jack billings to see dr koblin .
he's out sick today .
he'll be seeing dr tyberg .
i like dr koblin .
don't worry .
dr tyberg's very nice .
just take him into room 3 .
where's laura?
who?
you're standing at her desk .
that laura .
she's out sick too .
there's a lot of flu going around .
now , come on .
doctor's got a busy day .
come on .
it'll be over before you know it .
hey , hey !
i'm dr tyberg .
can't i wait for my doctor?
your doctor was called away on an emergency .
the nurse said he had the flu .
that was the emergency .
he came down with flu , very quickly .
so , the sooner we start , the sooner we finish .
come .
i show you something very cool .
i'm sorry .
doctor patient privacy in room .
you can wait in reception area , or glass of water , or ...
hey , trust me .
i am doctor .
please .
it's phone .
yeah?
all , all .
frank?
i am here .
you're early .
yeah , we had fantastic tailwinds .
put two hours on my vacation , just like that .
from now on , it's the only way i'm flying .
tailwinds or nothing .
glad you made it .
hello .
sorry , dr dunietz is not in today .
call back monday .
i'm a little tied up .
you mind taking a cab?
you have the address , yes?
oh , thank you .
i heard the fish down here is fantastic .
i could make us a bouillabaisse .
you like bouillabaisse , frank , no?
i gotta go .
frank !
maybe we'll wait for his regular doctor .
it's important that he receives immunisations .
i'm sure .
but a week won't make a difference .
no , we're doing it now .
get going , jack !
look at me .
look at me .
remember my promise?
yes .
it's ...
it's me !
get out !
frank .
shit .
the patient's not cooperating .
prep the vehicle .
come on , hurry .
don't worry .
everything's gonna be ok .
freeze !
put your guns on the ground !
get down !
si .
they got away .
cazzo !
plan b?
yes .
plan b.
oh , you made it .
oh , what's that?
jack's birthday present .
baseball uniform , cleats , glove and a bat .
it's his favourite sport .
it was .
last year .
he's on a soccer team now .
he's good .
you know , you should see him sometime .
hello .
mr and mrs billings !
they're coming !
hide , everyone .
hide !
yes .
good morning , mr driver .
who is this?
look in your rear view mirror and you'll see .
i know what you're thinking .
bulletproof glass .
so tell me , in your experience which judging from the performance you put on in the office goes way beyond driving children to school does bulletproof glass stop a 7 . 62 armour piercing round?
frank , why have you stopped the car?
don't look , they are triangulated over 300 feet away .
frank , pick up .
you screwed up my plan .
i am going to tell you how to set things right .
someone is going to appear in a few seconds .
let her in .
driver .
good boy .
good boy .
hi .
leave it on .
personally , i hate kids .
i don't know what your feelings are on the subject , but if you ever want to have any , make no moves but the moves i tell you to make .
you're in her hands now .
they can be gentle hands , but they can be the hands from hell .
trust me on this one .
trust him on this one .
now , drive .
make a left .
i said left .
listen , we keep doing this your way , they're gonna catch us .
do this my way , no one gets hurt .
where's the fun in that?
let's save the fun for later .
hey !
not bad .
didrt your mother teach you to say thank you?
she tried , and failed miserably .
i think we lost them .
think again .
thought complete .
let's go .
you can't find him?
he's one man in one car .
he's a chauffeur , for chrissakes .
not exactly , sir .
there's a possibility he was in on it .
that's impossible .
how would you know?
he could have been setting this up the whole time , and you wouldn't have known .
and you are an expert on knowing people .
his background .
he's ex special forces .
headed a commando unit .
specialised in search and destroy .
been in and out of lebanon , syria , sudan .
the man is a hunter .
i don't care what his skills are or where he's from .
this is not a war zone , this is an american city !
where's my son?
last stop .
all out .
you're quite a guy .
another time , another place you and me , baby , the pleasure we could have .
beauty .
frank .
frank !
frank !
not what you expected when you reported for work this morning , is it , frank?
no?
is that what passes for wit in this circle?
in this circle , my friend , wit is not a requirement of the job .
brutality , yes .
an ability to inflict pain , absolutely .
a certain psychotic , moral ignorance , blind obedience , all required .
but not wit .
how was it?
fun .
only the beginning , my love .
what's this all about?
a timely question .
max .
pardon me .
hello .
put me on the speaker .
in the next two hours , you'll get five million dollars in $100 bills .
put them in a waterproof suitcase , go to the bayfront park personally .
there will be a blue chrysler parked there .
place the suitcase in the trunk , and leave .
i don't know if i can get five million dollars in two hours .
i read the newspapers .
when you were appointed to your current position , your net won'th exceeded 100 million dollars , so you won't even feel the bite .
what guarantee do i have that you won't harm my son?
guarantee "?
mr billings , i am not a car dealer .
don't let the charming accent and my impeccable syntax mislead you .
i live in the jungle , and in the jungle you either eat or be eaten .
but , in the spirit of business , here is the guarantee .
ten minutes past the deadline , if the money doesn't arrive , i send a finger .
20 minutes , a hand .
30 minutes , a foot .
sounds like we have a deal .
you have a deal .
could we please speak to our son?
mommy !
mommy !
you have two hours , mr billings .
starting now .
just get my son !
all right .
all right .
frank , you promised you wouldn't let anybody hurt me !
you promised !
never make promises you can't keep .
i don't .
it's one of my rules .
wow .
bravo .
a man who leads his life by rules .
in my world rules are meant to be broken .
not mine .
you're gonna have to make an exception .
go .
prego .
go .
hey , driver !
no , no , wait , wait .
a little distance between us isn't a bad thing .
andiamo !
now .
hold on .
the signal .
hello .
it's me .
you son of a bitch .
look , i had nothing to do with this .
one scratch on his head ...
let me speak to who's in charge .
this is us marshal stappleton .
act fast .
there are three boats .
tell us where you are .
get a plane .
they're heading north .
tell me where you are .
just tell us where you are !
hello , frank?
got it .
all .
tarconi , it's me .
get out of the house .
i was just putting the madeleines ...
forget the madeleines , just get out .
and go where?
anywhere .
go to the beach .
oh , the beach .
the famous miami beach .
oh , my dream .
i would love to go to the beach .
maybe not .
freeze !
who the fuck are you?
i'm the cook .
oh .
this is a mistake .
a terrible mistake .
why we can't all just get along , you know?
hello .
it's frank .
pretend it's someone else .
hi , susan .
no , i'm just here at home .
i didn't do it , audrey .
she had a gun on jack .
i had no choice .
yeah , i saw that .
what do you know?
it's more than a kidnapping .
they asked for a ransom .
the doctors , they were fake .
they were trying to give jack a shot .
when i interrupted them ...
i promised jack i wouldn't let anyone hurt him .
i'm not gonna break that promise .
frank .
i'll call you back .
audrey .
is everything all right?
that's a pretty stupid question to ask , jeff .
all right .
so tell me again , inspector tarconi , why you didn't immediately identify yourself as a police officer .
oh , i was overwhelmed by the effectiveness of your operation , the sophistication of your equipment .
you know , i work in a small office in a small town .
we only have small crimes .
i was a little insecure .
you and frank martin are friends , right?
a friend?
oh , i wouldn't say exactly a friend .
i know him , we have a relationship .
a long relationship?
not so long .
they found you cooking in his house .
i'm french !
so?
we don't need to know someone a long time in order to cook for them .
it's an icebreaker .
take , for example , this sandwich and coffee you so graciously offer me .
well , pardon me to think so , but it's not very good .
i know , but what has that got to do with anything?
do you have a kitchen?
stay back .
stay back .
don't move .
smith !
drop it .
oh , jesus .
what happened?
we'll take care of it for you .
is this safe?
look over your shoulder .
we got you covered .
as my mother used to say , a meal is only limited by your imagination .
crme brle et croque monsieur .
cream brle?
crme brle .
cock?
croque monsieur .
croque monsieur .
oui?
where are you?
cooking .
cooking .
can you talk?
oh , speak of the devil .
my mother .
mom .
please , do you mind?
thank you .
oui , maman .
je suis trs bien arriv .
oui , trs trs bien , merci .
oui .
ah , oui , c'est une trs jolie ville .
may i ask who you're cooking for?
for the us marshals .
once they found my badge , they were very polite .
they gave me a coffee and a sandwich .
you wouldn't believe what passes for food here .
i am correcting the situation while they wait for my chief to call and confirm everything .
of course , that might take a while .
he's never there .
anything about me?
they are very interested about you .
they want to know where you are .
where are you?
nowhere for very long .
listen , hold on .
do you have access to a computer?
easier than having access to something decent to eat .
oh , handsome fellow .
who is he?
do they have an id program?
forgive me .
i'm not so used to this system .
at home , there is one computer for ten of us .
so , how is it with you , frank?
it's a complicated story .
ah , you mean you are in the shit?
you might say that .
in other words , your natural state .
voil .
a russian biologist with advanced degrees from the state laboratory .
do we have an address?
miami , boca west , king street , number 11 .
get out !
hey !
what are you doing?
trying to catch a bus .
come on .
what are you doing , driver?
not so good on the water , hey?
stop it !
stop it !
ok .
ok .
tell me about the doctor's office .
what doctor's office?
where you tried to stick the kid with this .
you want to tell me?
do you know what you have done?
do you know what you have done?
obviously something not conducive to your good health , which is all i needed to know .
have a good life ... what's left of it .
outpost to base .
the ransom is still there .
thanks .
the ransom hasn't been picked up .
don't worry .
what if it's notjust a kidnapping?
i've worked on many kidnapping cases .
if they don't take it i won't get my son back .
don't make this any more complicated than it is .
i'm not making this complicated , jefferson .
it's because of yourjob .
what does my job have to do with this?
it has everything to do with it .
because you became famous , we became the targets .
no matter what you think , the only one who's out there trying to get jack back is frank .
the chauffeur?
you spoke to frank martin?
what the hell are you doing talking to him?
he's the last person who saw jack alive !
we've found the boy .
hard drive blew .
get another one in there .
yes , sir .
how long is it gonna take?
ma'am , we're going as fast as we can .
he can suffocate in there .
stay calm .
it's my son !
let them work .
are you gonna sit and do nothing?
they're experts .
everyone is an expert !
i've had it with all of you !
audrey !
audrey !
audrey !
audrey !
mommy !
jack !
are you ok?
there you go , little buddy .
breathe .
come on , breathe .
you're the devil .
i wish .
shit !
dimitri , you scare shit in me .
where is sonovitch?
in chamber .
i need to speak with him .
sit down !
listen panasonic .
is rap music , is good .
what was that?
i don't know .
shit !
what are you doing?
i need antidote .
the driver , he inject me with virus .
look !
dimitri , where would he get the virus?
the one we left in doctor's surgery .
please , i need antidote .
i am sick .
calm down .
you're not sick .
you have four hours before the virus is active .
you know that .
you worked on creating it .
open fridge .
i'm telling you ...
izvinite .
open fridge .
open the fridge !
yes .
insurance policy .
how many you have?
two doses .
enough for tipov and myself .
tipov's policy cancelled .
there is one for me .
and i want it now .
come on .
come on .
let's do it !
let's not .
who are you?
there is enough for two .
you don't need it .
but you injected me .
with water .
i'm not sick .
you're not sick .
water .
water .
son of bitch !
good .
our problem is solved .
one dose for each of us .
it's not for us .
one for you and one for the child .
touching .
my patience is about to run out .
tell me about the virus .
ok .
what do you want know?
everything .
what is it?
a recombinant retroimmune double polymorphing effluent .
the child will die .
anyone he breathes on will die , and then it's over .
what do you mean , " it's over?
the virus goes inert after 24 hours .
thanks for the lesson .
now give me the vials .
you really want to play superhero , don't you?
well , let's see if you can fly .
you ok?
i'm ok .
there's nothing to worry about .
it's just a simple viral infection combined with stress .
it should pass in a day or two .
i gave him something to help him sleep .
call me if anything arises .
thank you , doctor .
you know , audrey , all this has ... well , it's made me realise what a fool i've been .
with jack ... and with you .
are you ok?
mr billings .
we're running late .
i'll be right out .
i'd like to come by after the conference , check on jack .
check on you .
good .
i'll see you soon .
they're here if you need them .
are you all right , ma'am?
i'm fine .
hello .
it's me .
are you ok?
go to your bedroom .
hi , susan .
how are you?
i'm alone .
where are you , frank?
turn around .
frank , you were wrong .
it was a kidnapping .
jack is fine .
jack's been infected with a virus .
anyone who comes into contact with him will die .
what are you telling me?
are you telling me my son is gonna die?
no , he's not .
once incubated , the virus becomes airborne , so anyone he breathes on gets infected .
your son was a weapon .
the target is his father .
jefferson?
well , why?
the conference .
it's the only logical answer .
every drug enforcement agency in one room .
your husband breathes , the room dies .
you gotta trust me , audrey .
can you get to him?
what are you gonna do?
find the guy responsible .
he has more of this .
for you and everybody else .
for you now .
we have a guest .
you're burning up .
i'm ok .
you gotta go .
go .
don't move !
is the governor here?
everybody's here .
delegates from all over the world .
just a second .
hello .
jefferson , you can't go to the conference .
is everything all right? ... to give him a deadly virus ...
i can't hear you .
i'm inside .
i've got it , and so do you .
i can't hear you .
their plan is to infect everyone there .
i'm gonna have to call you back .
jeff !
mr billings , are you all right?
i'm all right .
come on , let's go .
you sure?
all .
you still a guest of the government?
they gave me the five star accommodation .
let me guess you need my help .
are you near the computer?
it's practically my pillow .
so , how do you want to start?
i don't know .
i have nothing .
ah .
my favourite type of investigation .
let's see .
alors .
i'd like to take this opportunity to introduce you to ...
breathe .
that's right , breathe , my friend , breathe .
once these bastards are out of the way and their agreements are dead and buried , you know what the biggest problem will be?
what?
counting the money .
i can't wait .
ay ay ay !
aah .
gianni chellini .
hires himself out to anyone looking to make trouble red brigade , shining path .
someone accessed a database on the 15th floor .
that's gonzalez .
he's on vacation .
was behind the hostage taking of the opec ministers in geneva .
it was a nice piece of work .
give me an address .
miami , east highland ,
pelican drive , number 26900 .
we've found the car .
you're one great cop , tarconi .
thank you for the compliment .
now i'm going back to sleep .
hm .
maybe not .
bumbaclaat , man !
move out the way !
move over .
i'll do ya !
mommy .
honey .
you feeling better?
a little bit .
why don't you try to go back to sleep , ok?
ma'am , are you all right?
jefferson .
jefferson , are you ok?
ok , do it .
what are you doing?
you know , last night got me thinking .
how do we transport the antidote safely?
we need something that won't break or can't be stolen .
something totally secure .
me .
impressive .
get dressed .
stop him .
these your friends?
not yet .
where'd they go?
the garage .
i'm out of ammo .
me too .
so am i.
where are the reloads?
the garage .
check the house .
go , go , go !
get him !
get him !
what d'you want me to do?
keep the meter running .
bye .
don't worry , baby .
you're safe now .
you're safe .
you're so beautiful .
remind me of my yellow poom poom rider .
don't move .
oh , mr driver .
i'll blow you into tomorrow .
i'll bleed what you came for all over the floor .
you wouldn't want this .
not after you worked so hard trying to get to the antidote .
take a good look , frank martin .
i'm a cure for what ails you .
i'm the only cure for what ails you .
i am the antidote .
nice try .
i'm impressed .
i didn't give you enough credit .
it took more than a driver to figure this out .
i haven't figured it all out yet .
perhaps i can help you .
what part are you a little thick on?
you .
why?
oh .
that's the easy part .
it's a business deal , pure and simple .
i'm for hire to the highest bidder .
in this case , the highest bidder was the colombian cocaine can'tels that wanted these pesky lawmen off their backs .
you think killing politicians will make things easier for them?
that's not my problem .
i was hired to do ajob .
i did the job , like you .
just my pay is better .
my hair and my suit , too .
oh , lola .
now , if you'll excuse me , i have a plane to catch .
kill him .
ciao .
don't even blink .
what's in this for you?
pleasure ... in killing you .
we're coming live from the key biscayne causeway where at least ten police cars are in hot pursuit of a stolen red pick up truck .
oh , my .
