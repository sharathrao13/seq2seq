she'll be fine .
she'll be okay .
you're ready .
you can do it .
we're all so glad you're comin'home , pumpkin .
heather flew in from new york , and caroline came from school .
and mom ...
boy , she's just so excited .
she just keeps saying , " you get my carla back here fast .
try these .
i'm sorry the headset hurt your ears , but they don't come in sizes .
how much longer before we land?
we're ahead of schedule .
we should be landing in about 15 minutes .
thank you .
teeth okay?
yes , they're okay .
honey , i'd like the girls to come with me to the palace of fine arts this weekend ... because there's this special exhibition ...
uh uh , carla .
oh , carla , dear .
can you please try to eat it with your fork , and that would be very ...
carla .
with your fork .
no , no , dear .
i said with the fork , not with the knife , dear .
all right .
no , no .
no more cake .
no .
no .
excuse me .
carla?
no , no , what is the matter?
oh , my gosh .
oh , car ...

radley .
radley .

it's my cake !
please , come on .
you're supposed to handle ...
please , radley .
radley .
leave me alone !
carla .
carla .
what the hell do they know?
they are experts , and she has all the symptoms .
she has an i. q bordering on 2nd grade .
i know about ...
i know a few things about experts .
she has ...
she has significant social adjustment problems .
and now her school ... i'm sorry .
where's my drink?
what's the matter?
what?
oh , your drink .
it's right there .
and now this school , her regular school won't even take her back .
what about that , radley?
ah , i need another drink .
forget the drink , radley !
now listen to me .
we need to talk about carla .
do you understand?
she is beautiful !
we have got to !
have you looked at her?
she is gorgeous .
she nearly burned the house down with the other two girls in it .
radley , we can't do this .
that ...
that was an accident .
you know that was an accident .
it was not .
we can't keep saying things like that .
we can't keep saying , " carla is a slow learner .
carla will blossom .
because those are lies .
now , radley , we have to do something .
we have to make a decision .
this is a special school in santa barbara .
all right , back up just ...
the school ...
it is for the mentally challenged .
right there .
yes , what?
now , they don't allow adults and the parents to go visit them .
they ...
they have limited ... limited visitation , and let me tell you something , radley .
if it doesn't work out , she doesn't have to be there .
i don't ...
i don't want her to be retarded .
of course you don't .
of course you don't .
i understand completely .
we have to send her there , radley .
we don't have a choice .
all right?
sign it .
how are you two doing here?
can i get you anything?
can i get you anything?
uh , no , i've got water , and , uh ...
ah .
we ordered a vegetarian worm .
no?
i'll see if i can find one in coach .
i would appreciate that .
i'd like to be the first to welcome you to san francisco international airport .
it's currently 54 degrees in the bay area ... and a beautiful , clear day .
thank you for choosing to fly with us .
she's here !
she's home .
mrs tate !
come on .
all right .
okay .
heather !
hang up !
she's home !
that call was important ... and you yelling in the background is not exactly good for business .
i'm sorry .
here we are .
ladies and gentlemen , the homecoming queen , carla tate .
we're all waiting for you .
come on , honey .
bring tickles .
come on .
oh .
ohh , hello , carla .
welcome home .
g ...
hello .
hello .
here .
i'll take this .
uh , would you like some help with that , sir?
hi , carla !
welcome home .
oh , carla , it's so good to have you home .
thanks .
say hello to carla .
we missed you , carla .
who's that?
uh ...
oh , well , um ...
this is jeff reed .
and , actually , carla , i have kind of a surprise for you because ... we're engaged to be married .
ooh , yea !
well , let me take your coat , dear .
all right?
no !
oh .
you sure?
you don't want ...
all right , fine .
just ...
dr johnson said that it would be nice ... if i got everybody presents .
oh !
and i thought so too .
well , thank you , carla .
it's , uh ...
it's necklaces .
oh !
and they're beautiful .
carla !
say cheese !
winnie !
welcome home !
i missed you !
it's so good to see you !
sweetheart !
we were thinking that maybe we would just like to elope , you know?
that's very funny , but not hysterical .
all right?
okay !
we're gonna have a big wedding ceremony at the church .
and the wedding ...
i know .
we're gonna have the wedding reception at the club .
you remember the club , don't you , carla dear?
yeah !
you know what .
you could just put this in your lap .
that's good .
that's very nice that way .
you look very grown up .
so i hear you and jeff settled on a honeymoon spot .
did you two do it yet?
no .
caroline .
she's gonna spit it out .
i can see it .
sex is something that we talk about in private , i think .
am i right?
no , but my teacher at the school says ... that two people do it when they're in love .
well , i'm sorry , but i'm sure she meant that you do it after , you know , you're married or something .
definitely .
and then you don't talk about it ever again in your whole life .
winnie .
a special dessert for carla .
oh , boy .
please .
that's nice .
so a doctorate , jeff?
that is so refreshing .
so what is your doctorate dissertation gonna be on?
um , multi tiered financing of petrol chemical surveys ... in an uncertain political terrain .
finding the big bucks in tiny little countries whose names you can't pronounce .
wow !
i mean , it's so good to hear someone's actually using their college education .
come on .
you know , i'm not teaching second grade because i happen to like children .
you know , i think that they're the hope of the world .
of course they're the hope of the world , but , really , isn't it just as noble ... to be a college professor and earn four times the money?
mother !
you know what .
daddy , will you make a toast right now?
i'd gladly make a toast , yeah .
to the tate family and its good ...
i want to go to school also .
that's great .
well , dear , you just completed school .
and , in fact , i think they gave you a certificate of completion , didn't they?
i am gonna be a veterinarian's assistant .
wow !
and , but to do that , i need a high school diploma .
i think the best thing for right now would be just to have a nice , big , long vacation ... and we'll explore your options later .
okay .
to the ta ...
i would like to explore my options now , mother .
carla , we're all just a little bit too tired for such an important conversation .
so , radley ...
to the tate family , all of us together again .
follow me .
hurry .
just follow me .
stop it .
stop following me .
i can't , stupid .
stop it !
i told you , i can't , stupid .
stop laughing at me !
oh , my goodness !
are you all right?
carla !
yeah .
all right .
now , i want you to close your eyes .
close your eyes .
okay , carla .
all right .
no , stop , stop .
stop .
yeah .
you can stop .
good girl .
open your eyes .
surprise .
do you ...
what do you think?
you think ...
do you like it?
you gave my room to somebody else?
no !
i redecorated it for you , dear .
i just changed it a little .
but where is my tea party table that was right here?
who did this?
well , carla , those are little girl things , and you're a young woman now .
remember , downstairs you were talking about taking on more responsibility .
well , this is ...
i want my things .
carla , i really think that you should live with these things for a while ... and you'll see , i'm sure that you will grow to like them very much .
and , anyway , dr johnson said that , uh , that these are your favourite colours .
uh , you like red , don't you?
where ...
carla , wh ...
why are your eyes closed?
i'm remembering my old room .
ohh !
heather?
heather !
bye .
i'm really sorry we didn't visit you more frequently ... but i got a job in new york , and caroline went to college .
so ...
yeah , but that's okay 'cause sometimes ... we thought that the visits sometimes upset the parents ... more than it made the kids happy .
well , we're sorry , carla .
but i liked all your letters that you wrote , heather .
they were better than caroline's ...
'cause she mostly drew pictures .
what?
honey , i think you just ...
she's overwhelmed by all of this .
now , why don't you just relax?
you did great , okay?
just don't be so hard on yourself .
radley , i'm gonna make it up to that girl .
i really am .
winnie !
your mother said another 15 minutes .
did you tell her that i don't like tennis still?
she said that all well bred girls play tennis ... chess or bridge .
oh .
is it 15 minutes yet?
we'll look at that .
we'll look at that right ...
hello , mrs tate .
how are you?
oh , victoria , you look so lovely .
thank you .
i'd like you to meet my daughter .
this is carla .
hello , carla .
hello .
didn't your other daughter , heather , get married?
no , no .
actually , it's , uh , caroline is engaged .
oh !
but anyway , i want to see a couple of sweater sets .
and , carla , come on .
that's a very nice shirt , mom .
very beautiful feet .
nice toes .
and the sock really accentuates your feet .
you know that the , uh , the chinese say ... that the toes are the windows to the soul?
they do?
i've been to hong kong several times , and i've never heard that .
why don't you just , uh , enlighten us with your knowledge of shoes?
do you have this in a size eight?
she's a little uptight , isn't she?
what?
it's tight .
this shoe's a little tight .
it'll ...
here .
how 'bout these?
these red ones here .
yes , this is a fun shoe , mom .
i don't think so .
thank you very much .
what about these with the heels?
remember the leather?
this is hip .
hip .
those are not what we want .
thank you so much .
mothers are always right .
and today the dogs are here to be seen ... in the hopes that they'll be adopted by the nice people of sutter hills .
and i'm a friend of your mother's .
and so , thank you from me ...
you know that your mother was the one who made this animal rescue shelter a possibility .
no .
i didn't ...
yes , and she did a lot of other things in sutter hills .
you're too kind .
the youth orchestra , the theatre , the library .
wow .
and today your mother's gonna get some recognition , which she deserves .
my job to introduce the head of our sutter hills city council ...
drew edison .
excuse me .
oh , sure .
of course .
good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen .
there are so many people to thank for this wonderful shelter .
hello , puppy .
and they used every ... carla , please .
fund raising device known to man ...
hello , puppy .
from a , a bake sale in my mother ...
pucky ryan's ... garden .
carla , please don't do that .
please .
you're disrupting . ... country club .
woof !
woof !
woof !
carla .
elizabeth .
elizabeth , your daughter is barking .
carla !
woof !
elizabeth , now they're all barking .
i know .
carla , dear .
carla .
carla !
oh , i'll quiet them , mom .
they like me .
carla , carla !
hello , puppies .
i'll teach you how to behave , little puppies .
stay !
no , go , go , go .
no !
come back in the cage .
come on .
behave !
mom !
it was so embarrassing , radley .
i feel like ...
i feel like i try all these things , and nothing works .
i've been doing my best to have fun with her , but i don't know what fun for her is .
and she won't even tell me .
honestly , i just want to quit .
mrs tate !
mrs tate !
carla's run away !
when the police picked her up , she gave them another name ... and listed this as her home address , so they threw her back here .
here's the police report .
did she really say that i'm smothering her?
in so many words .
yeah .
do you want to read the police report?
i just want you to know that i don't understand any of this , not for one second .
i give her love , i protect her , i teach her , and suddenly that's smothering .
those are her words , not mine , mrs tate .
did she tell you that i took her to the pet shelter so she could possibly get a job?
yes , and we agreed it ended badly .
could you ...
could you not?
that's a hand carved indian relic .
i'm sorry .
i also enrolled her in a calligraphy class , an origami class .
and i , i even got her into that ...
she doesn't want to do those things .
they ...
they don't interest her .
they don't work for her .
maybe carla doesn't know what works for her .
and you do .
i think so .
i'm her mother .
that's why she tried to hitchhike over 200 miles to get back here?
would she do that again?
i believe she will , yes .
if things continue at home the way they've been going , yes , absolutely yes .
and we were lucky this time .
she came back here .
a lot of kids run away , we never hear from them again .
this is a girl who is determined to push the edge of the envelope .
and i , for one , i like the fact that she never quits .
specifically , she wants to attend this , uh , uh , bay area polytech .
a public vocational school?
is that what you're talking about?
they do welding there .
she can't possibly keep up with that .
and she's going to be humiliated by those people there .
you don't know they're going to humiliate her .
of course they're going to humiliate her !
please ...
they ...
they did it when she was young .
l ...
she's got to have the opportunity to meet challenges .
i mean , do you want the ... do you want the kid to remain a child the rest of her life ... or do you want to let her grow into an adult and take the same risks that you and i take?
i want her to take risks .
it's the kind of ri ...
are you a parent?
uh , no , not yet , no , no , but i have worked with children ... including yours , for ten years .
y ...
you think she should go to school and be on her own?
independence can give carla something ... that you and i will never be able to give her .
dignity .
what?
dignity .
dignity .
to the left .
thanks a lot .
okay , honey , here we are now .
uh , you sure you don't want me to walk you in?
no , dad , i'm not ...
i'm fine .
come on , man .
you got to remember to lock your bike up , man .
your mama's gettin 'tired of buyin 'you bikes .

hey , don't talk like that .

hi , little puppy !
hello , puppy .
no , no , don't touch .
he's not for petting .
he's for drug sniffing .
he's on a break .
okay .
sorry .
well , hello , ladies .

oh , mr taylor , hi !
i just have to tell you this is the best computer class i have ever taken .
well , looks like you're doing just fine .
and it is such thanks to you .
before i came to this class , i just didn't even know the difference ... between , like , a rom or a ram or a bit or a byte .

happy 22nd , carla .
yeah !
thank you for coming back for my birthday .
are you kidding?
we wouldn't miss this for the world .
yeah , winnie tells me that , uh , carla bought groceries for the family this week ... and she did some of the cooking too , right , winnie?
and she helped me do all my laundry that i brought from school .
yeah .
and i recycled all the garbage , mother .
i know .
well , i mean , someday you'll be able to take care of this house without me .
that's for sure .
not this house .
maybe one day i'll be able to take care of my own apartment ...
like some of the kids at school do .
oh , carla , you don't know what you're saying .
yes , i do .
no , we can't discuss this right now , all right?
open these presents .
here .
there .
but ...
thank you , radley .
here you go , dear .
there .
" carla . " it's from ...
excuse me now .
i have to go feed my fish .
oh .
mother , why did you do that?
aw , mom .
what did i do?
i mean , maybe she's ready for her own apartment .
you know , a lot of the new books out right now ... you know , they ... they advocate disabled people living on their own .
what are we movin 'the presents for?
why don't we just take a vote?
yeah , voting's nice .
oh , a family meeting .
yes !
a family meeting .
we haven't had a family meeting in ages .
i would love to try it .
i think we should just forget this , because i just want to say something .
this is not a political referendum .
this is a child's life .
and this is my child's life .
carla's not ready for an apartment .
and really , she may never be ready for an apartment .
my god !
what if there were a fire?
what if there was a burglar?
well , that can happen to anyone , honey .
" what if? " no , but not with carla .
she can't handle the unexpected , radley .
you know that .
mother , i think that she has tried very hard to show that she's a responsible person .
heather !
she's capable .
you don't live here any more , so you don't vote !
mom , why don't you think of it this way , as a ...
oh , look , caroline , you and jeffrey can raise your children any way you want to raise them , but this is my child !
all right .
all right .
ease up .
you know something?
i don't know what you're trying to do .
i don't know what you're trying to prove by refuting every single thing i say .
i'm not refuting everything you say !
i didn't want to put her in that place !
but i had to .
i had no other choice .
she needed professional help .
now it is carla's turn , and i am going to protect her !
and nobody's going to tell me how to do it , not even you , radley .
no !
girls , inside , please .
i guess we'll be forever 10 and 12 .
marcia and jan .
don't you understand what i'm trying to say?
elizabeth , shut the hell up .
it means a lot to me ...
do not ...
do not speak to me that way in front of the children .
and we are both responsible for putting carla in that place .
you went along with it because you were too drunk to face it .
i made that decision by myself !
i wasn't drinking when i picked her up , and i haven't had a drink ... since that family meeting 8 years , 4 months and 11 days ago !
that is not the ...
that is not the same ...
it is the same family .
damn it !
our family , elizabeth !
excuse me .
oh .
dinner will be served soon .
i'll skip dinner .
permission to come aboard?
permission granted .
i don't know what's the matter with me .
i just ...
i ...
anyway , i never meant to insinuate anything against you .
maybe we should just trust carla .
but it's not just trusting carla .
i really don't think so .
i think it's everybody .
it's everything out there .
it's the ...
well , she can live near us .
that way we can keep an eye on her .
she just got back .
does she have to leave so soon?
not like you planned , huh?
no .
mm mmm .
mm mmm .
is anybody coming to dinner , or are we voting on what's being served?
what?
what is ...
well ...
hot roll or baguette?
i think i will have a hot roll ...
oh , come on , please .
this is just absurd .
this is not a casual decision , and carla is not like other girls .
but i don't want to be the one who always says no to her .
i really don't .
so i'm gonna try and see it your way .
i'm gonna try and see ...
oh !
i am so happy , mama !
this is so great !
carla?
this is ...
you could come and help me pick an apartment out ...
not quite so hard to mom .
okay .
and everything .
all right , maybe we will .
maybe i could do that .
i could call up gibson realty .
we could have them , you know , get a couple of videos .
dear , that is my ...
oh , dear .
mom , this is the best ...
birthday present i've ever had .
please don't do that .
i'm thrilled .
is everybody happy?
bye !
bye , daniel !
bye !
bye !
bye , daniel !
bye !
bye , carla !
bye .
l i'll see you tomorrow .
goodbye .
so who's the fella?
is he kind of a sweetheart?
no , that's my friend daniel .
um , but i like to call him danny .
danny .
well , danny's kind of cute .
stop teasing , dad !
carla , this way .
uh , your father mentioned that you met a young man .
yeah , that's daniel .
but i told dad that he was just a " friend " friend , not a boyfriend .
darling , don't sit there !
it's just wet .
no , it isn't , mom .
it's dry .
it's dry , mom .
well , carla , you're going to be getting this apartment ... and i'm sure you're gonna want to have visitors come over ... and i'm sure that some of these visitors are going to be ... well , they're going to be young men .
mom , is this a sex talk?
no .
well , yes .
is that okay?
okay .
all right .
okay .
well , then i know that recently you mentioned , um ... doing it ... and i just wanted to know if you really know what that means .
yeah , that's what thomas porter calls it .
and mrs matthews , the health teacher and the cafeteria monitor ... she called it coitus .
and she also told us about penis ...
okay , we've got it .
and vulva .
shh .
carla .
just a little less loud , okay?
and then she was telling us all about semen ...
carla , honey .
and how there's 50 billion sperms in one shot , and that ...
no , no , no .
we do have the ...
we have the ...
yeah , yeah .
all right .
that's very good .
no , no .
i know all about it .
you know all about it .
i understand that .
you know all about reproduction .
that's excellent .
good .
yeah , and she also told me ... that people like us ... they ... boys can try to take advantage ... and that they'll try to coitus us .
so if that should ever happen , to say , " no !
oh .
okay .
stop right there !
good .
and that's excellent advice .
what else did she say to you?
don't put gum under the cafeteria table !
how many times do i have to tell you?
she's teaching you a lot of variety there .
anyway , dear , with this apartment , i just don't think that you should have , um ... any boyfriends over for a while , all right?
is that okay with you?
but , mom ... what if i want to go visit ... at someone else's apartment?
well , in that case , you remember " no , stop .
and you don't forget your pepper spray .
whose apartment might you be visiting , carla?
nobody's .
i was just saying what if .
i'm gonna go feed the birds .
okay .
oh , geez .
no , carla , wait !

but i took four buses already .
i don't know what to tell you , but that bus will take you there .

and he lives down in the basement all alone .
what i really like is the kitchen .

it's sweet .
you know , and a lot of the owners don't like to rent to people like carla .
and knowing that ...
i'm sorry .
would you wait one second?
well , i mean , not don't like to ...
i'm sorry , but there are no people like carla , okay?
she happens to be a very unique young woman .
okay .
okay .
of course she is , but they just wanna know ... if the unique young woman is gonna leave the gas on ... or if she's gonna leave the door unlocked .
this is them asking , not me .
is she reliable?
well , of course she's reliable .
i mean , this is her first apartment , though .
i mean , i can't vouch for the fact that the window might not be left open during a rainstorm ... but what mother can vouch for that?
look , i understand what their concerns are , but let me tell you something right now , okay?
my daughter happens to be a very amazing person .
she's tough , and she is adamant to be on her own .
she's gonna be just fine .
now , if there's any sort of a problem , i am only 15 minutes away .
you think that's gonna be enough for them?
it's enough for me .

but you didn't say anything about $50 before .

thomas porter , at my school , he used to go like this .

but , mom ...
oh , dear .
i have to learn my slow dances too .

my dad gives these instead of candy .
oh !
up and down , and not across .
thank you !
okay .
bye , carla .
bye , mom .
bye .
bye .
be good .
oh , dear .
well ...
i am not the person who is singing
i am the silent one inside
i am not the one who laughs at people's jokes
we're not responsible for lost items ... so please make sure you pick up your wings and your antlers .
also , for those interested ... the first quarter grades are posted downstairs on the bulletin board .
who's next?
i want to see if i passed .
come on , daniel .
um , well , o okay .
she said it was downstairs .
he who makes the monsters
he who strips my confidence
i passed it .
i passed it , daniel !
i passed my subject in a regular school ... with real tests and regular teachers .
i did it , daniel !
i love polytechnic school !
i love my teachers !
i love everybody , daniel !
but ...
but , daniel ... you didn't fail by much , just a smidge .
my ...
ohh .
i didn't ...
i didn't want to fail by a smidge .
i wanted ...
i i i wanted to ...
i wanted to get out of one class ... just 'cause i passed , not 'cause i was ... n not 'cause i was too old .
it's o ...
it's o ...
it's okay , daniel .
don't ...
don't be upset .
no !
no , it isn't okay !
it isn't ...
everybody ...
everybody's right !
everybody's right , carla !
every ...
i am ...
i'm dumb !
everybody's right , carla !
everybody ...
carla ...
c carla , can you ...
c could you go away for a second?
please?
okay .
okay .
at my special school they taught us ... that first you learn the easy courses .
then after you learn those , you try the harder courses .
only they're not so hard any more ... because you learned the easy stuff first .
see?
an another reason i got mad is 'cause i i didn't want you to think i was dumb .
i could never think that .
it's amazing how you
can speak right to my heart
without sayin'a word
you can light up the dark
try as i may
i could never explain
what i hear when you don't say a thing
the smile on your face
lets me know that you need me
there's a truth in your eyes
sayin'you'll never leave me
the touch of your hand
says you'll catch me
if ever i fall
you say it best
when you say nothin'at all
okay , you're disappointed .
disappointed in what?
uh , me?
you?
us?
what?
well , no , dear , not us .
but , i mean , of course it has been bumpy at times .
but ...
but i always thought we'd end up like this , you know .
somehow sailing along together .
oh , well , good , good .
you're not disappointed in us .
'cause i love sailing with you .
the girls , they never really liked sailing much .
yeah .
you disappointed with the girls?
well , i feel like i'm the mother of a dedicated underachiever , a gay workaholic ... and carla , who thinks she can conquer this whole terrifying world that we live in .
honey , they're doing fine .
they're not drug addicts ; they're not axe murderers ; they're not democrats .
i don't know .
tell me ...
i don't know why i am talking like this anyway ... but honestly , radley , sometimes i think that there must be some mothers out there in the world ... who are better equipped to handle carla .
elizabeth , stop it , will ya .
i mean , i know that i fail in some horrible way .
do you know ...
oh , i'll shut up .
i promise .
radley , i'm gonna shut my mouth .
honey , you're just trying to be honest with yourself .
it's okay .
it's not fair , radley .
it's not fair .
