your mother's trial starts this morning .
how long do you think it'll last?
could be a while .
with eighty six counts of espionage against her , the prosecution alone could take months just to present their case .
i want to see the opening arguments .
i'll arrange for a closed circuit feed into the ops center .
thanks .
you know any jokes?
'cause i could use one .
this grasshopper walks into a bar and the bartender says ,
hey , we have a drink named after you ! " and the grasshopper says
you have a drink named doug?
well , i was going to use phil .
well , phil is certainly no funnier than doug .
no , i know , i'm sorry .
it's a non humorous , uh ...
mr. sark .
as you know , he's proven himself to be a key player in the world of international organized crime .
now he may be developing a bioweapon systemized form a virus that we've never seen before .
this is klaus richter , a former employee of sark's whom we've recently taken into custody .
a routine medical workup revealed that richter may have been exposed to the virus before we picked him up .
marshall?
thank you , sir .
okay , now , take a look on your screen here .
these little squiggly things that's just a normal flue anti body , something that you might have if you got a common cold , or cough , something .
now let's take a look at richter's blood work .
now this shows antibodies one thousand per cent above normal levels .
very similiar to the ebola virus , most notably massive hemorrhaging .
except that this virus works by breaking down bonds between cells , so basically richter's body in just a couple of days is gonna look oooh like , well , did you ever see that movie " the fly "?
do you remember that little poor red assed baboon when he was , like , turned inside out?
thank you , marshall .
we recently uncovered a charter agreement indicating that sark rented a medically equipped 727 to transport three patients presumably suffering from the same virus as richter to a private hospital in geneva .
this hospital is one of sark's business fronts .
we believe he's assembled a team to study the virus .
your objective is to infiltrate the facility and acquire the research .
jack , you'll be entering the hospital as a patient in need of a kidney transplant .
sydney , you'll be accompanying him as the loving daughter who's agreed to donate one .
i trust this one won't be too much of a stretch , hmmm , for either of you?
we should talk .
we have nothing to talk about .
i know you have questions .
you can either be angry , or you can be informed .
please try to understand what i'm about to tell you , sydney .
after your mother left , i tested project christmas on you because i didn't want you to be a victim .
i thought it was my responsibility to teach you how to think strategically , to see through people's lies , to be as strong as you could be in an environment where one mistake could cost you your life .
then you should've told me the truth before i ended up here .
yes , you're right !
i never intended you to lead a double life .
i imagined recruiting you into the cla after you finished college .
but sloane got to you first , and that is a mistake i will never live down .
i'd like to believe you , but i don't trust anything you say .
closed circuit's online , the proceeding start in about a minute .
and the feed will be right over here .
thanks , rick .
sure .
that's senator douglas .
where's the judge?
distiguished witnesses , i know you were expecting opening arguments for the prosecution of irina derevko , but as of this morning a plea agreement has been reached with the defendant .
in regard to the eighty six counts of espionage leading to the deaths of twelve united states operatives ,  derevko has pled guilty on all counts .
a select penalty jury was empanelled early this morning and the decision was predictably swift .
derevko received the maximum sentence under federal statute death by lethal injection .
since she's opted to forego all appeals , the execution will be carried out three days from today .
session adjourned .
confidential to deputy director devlin .
i'm writing to inform you that my father ,
jack bristow , did willfully deceive the cla into believing irina derevko violated her immunity agreement .
i'm committing this statement to paper so it may be used in an officiial capacity to halt my mother's execution .
despite her past crime , i can't in good conscience allow her sentence to be carried out when she kept her word to cooperate with us .
it is not irina derevko who should be answering to these charges .
it is my father .
we have a dead drop .
request pick up .
looks like a letter .
copy that .
sending agent for retrieval .
when my mom first came back , i wanted her dead .
how the hell did i become the person who's trying to save her?
that doesn't mean that you have to be her best friend .
it means that you did the right thing .
how are you?
oh , i got my , uh , thirty days sobriety chip .
even though i wasn't ever a drug addict , i'm kind of proud .
oh , by the way , you know anybody who wants a car?
i'm hocking mine .
you're selling your car?
yeah , well , it's either that or i quit paying my student loans .
i can't afford to have bad credit and a criminal record .
well , i know you're going to say no but i can lend you money .
yes , i'm gonna say no .
but thank you .
hey .
in the morning , i got rear ended by four frat guys coming home from a party .
two of them threw up while i was getting their insurance information .
at least they had insurance .
why are you cleaning like this?
you're acting like howard hughes .
well , the zagat guy is coming to give his review today .
i want this place spotless .
there's a hamburger behind you .
you know , francie , i worked up through los feliz and atwater village .
oh , cool , cliff , thanks .
give me just a second?
okay , i told him i'd give him a couple bucks if he just handed out some fliers , got the word out .
hamburgers aren't on the menu , are they?
garden burger .
how much are you paying that guy?
twelve bucks an hour .
hamburger's making more than i am .
keep cleaning , sweetie .
i gotta clean .
i gotta catch a plane .
be safe .
okay .
sir , if you'll recall project christmas was developed by jack bristow to train potential cla recruits at a young age .
now , based on the research irina derevko stole from him , the kgb developed their own version of the project .
yes , i recall .
one of our assets in moscow just sent this over .
it's a test questionnaire administered to a group of first graders in the early eighties .
the test was designed to identify kids who would make good agents in the soviet secret service .
reading over it , what really struck me is how similiar these questions are to a standard iq test given to first graders in this country .
where are you going with this?
remember the rumour going around the agency around the cold war about the soviets raising sleeper agents as americans?
now , i know it sounds potentially paranoid , but this is how they would do it if they managed to get their test in circulation here .
they could have contacted hundreds of kids .
interesting , but unlikely .
i just think it would be intersting to analyze tests from
stop .
we can't spare a single agent right now , much less a team for a project that at best has historical value .
the kgb doesn't even exist anymore !
i see your mother's latest maneuver had its intended effect on you .
what maneuver would that be?
pleading guilty , accepting the death penalty .
yep .
she's got us right where she wants us .
not us .
you .
your mother's no fool .
she must have deduced i set her up , so why do you imagine she pled guilty?
because she was struck by a crisis of conscience?
i think she knew the verdict was a foregone conclusion .
she pled guilty to keep you from witnessing her trial , sydney , from having you see photos of the agents she savagely murdered , including vaughn's father .
she knew if you sat through that , whatever sympathy she'd managed to elicit from you would vanish , so she cast herself as the victim to compel you to save her and guess what?
you fell for it .
i thought you deserved a second chance to think things over .
here's your letter .
how'd you get that?
i spent a decade with this woman and another twenty years analyzing how she could have deceived me for so long .
trust me when i tell you , i am protecting you .
no , you're not .
i think you loved mom so much that when she left you , you lost your soul .
you know what else i think?
i think the kind of man who'd use his own daughter to frame her mother , who'd test psych experiments when she was six years old is the kind of man who looks at his daughter and sees his greatest mistake .
you can't honestly believe that .
it's true , isn't it?
if mom hadn't fooled you , if you hadn't been so gullible , i never would have been born .
i'm going to finish reviewing the mission now .
thanks .
thanks for coming .
of course .
is everything all right?
okay , look , i don't i don't know how to say this other than to just say it .
i need a job .
with all the publicity , no one will hire me .
i thought maybe you could help me out .
i mean ,
i don't mean to be an agent .
i know the cla has a ton of front companies defense contractors , shipping companies .
i'll work at a desk , anywhere , just as long
look , i know this will drive you insane , but we can't employ you because you have a criminal record .
i have a criminal record because of a drug habit i never had .
you know anybody who wants to buy a car?
there might be something .
i have a discretionary fund used for informants .
totally off the books .
i could pay you to do research .
seriously?
man , i would so owe you .
this is a list of questions , please keep them to yourself .
all i need you to do is find out if any of these questions ever appeared on a standardized test in the united states over the last twenty years .
okay , the more you tell me the faster i can get you what you want , so
i pay by the hour .
take your time .
thank you .
you're welcome .
mr. harris , i'm jan spinnaker , hospital administrator .
welcome to st. auburn's .
my daughter , and the very twinkle of my eye marion .
daddy , stop it !
it's so nice to meet you .
a pleasure to meet a daughter who'd sacrifice so much for her father .
i would do anything for my daddy .
this way , please .
the computer in this satchel provides me a secure link to my money .
the satchel cannot be removed from my arm during the operation .
all arrangements have been made
now , i chose your hospital for its high security standards .
we employ security with training equivalent to the secret service .
you won't be disappointed .
very good !
okay , you're going to geneva to get a sample of a top secret virus .
now , your cover is you're going in for kidney transplants .
well , now , you're probably thinking now ,
hold on a second , marshall !
we need our kidneys !
well , don't worry .
they're not going anywhere because of this .
now , basically , when you are positioned in the or , press this button lightly twice .
it will activate a tank of halothane .
now , halothane is the same anesthetic they're pumping through your masks .
why don't you both try counting backwards from ten?
ten ... nine ... eight ...
which leads us to question number two .
if they're pumping anesthesia in the room and you're also gulping it down what did i do with by the maskful , then what's going to prevent us from passing out ourselves?
the solution is in the solution .
it's a mix of anti anesthetia and i also , for good measure , threw in a time release synthetic caffeine that i use in my decaf every morning .
just take it right before you head into the hospital and trust me , you won't fall asleep .
six ... five ... four ... three ... two ... one ...
they'll be out for fifteen minutes .
they've all been sedated for the pain .
patient zero's in there .
get a blood sample , i'll download the viral research .
irina?
i need help !
don't struggle .
he could tear the gloves off , you could become infected .
i'll up his morphine .
irina?
irina?
his vitals fell below the preset warning levels .
the doctors will be alerted .
work fast .
eagle eye , this is blackbird .
requiring early extraction , lz bravo .
copy that , blackbird .
eta lz bravo , three minutes .
come on .
come on , come on , come on !
this is dr. giselle , i need security teams on the research level , now !
we need to get to the roof .
the elevator won't come to this floor !
security will flank us from both sides of the hall .
we can't reload the tranqs fast enough to take out another four people .
find some iodine .
ammonia and iodine form an unstable compound when they're mixed together .
initiate level three lockdown , perimeter and elevators !
i've got this !
blackbird , we're on the roof , we're waiting for you !
don't shoot !
against the wall !
bypass the lockdown , i'll hold them off !
buy me ten seconds , i need more time !
ammo !
sydney !
if you're wondering why that man mistook you for your mother , he worked for her .
i skimmed the research as it was downloading .
before she surrendered to the cla , irina deliberately ordered
sark to expose some of her own operatives to the virus in order to study it .
ask yourself if that's a person worth saving .
i had toxicology analyze the glass of wine that somehow made its way into my house last week .
they found a compound called vtx which counteracts the effects of sodium morphate .
sodium morphate is the poison i used to ... end emily's suffering .
i see two possibilities .
either emily predicted your intention to euthanize her , took the necessary countermeasures and is now playing a game with you , or the more likely scenario someonewants you to believe emily's alive or worse , they'll try and make the alliance believe it , too .
if they think that i failied to carry out the one condition of my admittance , that i have been betraying them the whole time , then they'd be forced to assume that my entire division is rogue .
then we'll all be in danger .
i don't think i can ever forgive my father for the things he's done , but maybe he's right about what he's been saying all alone .
maybe her cooperation is partof some eleborate strategy he's more equipped to see than i am .
look , your father's asking you to let her die for something she might do .
i don't think you can live with that .
good work in geneva .
thanks .
the cla is analyzing the copy of the disk you brought back .
if sd 6 plans on using the virus as a weapon we might be able to get a jump on the antidote thanks to the blood work you brought back .
i hope so .
oh , listen , there's something else you should know .
will came to me for a job .
he did?
well , he didn't want to bother you so i hired him off the books to do some research .
on what?
just background on the old kgb version of project christmas .
of course , i didn't tell him that .
he thinks he's comparing iq tests against the public record .
i just figured it was your perogative to tell him more .
that was really nice of you , thanks .
you're welcome .
there's nothing more boring than a commerce bureau luncheon .
thanks for joining me , jack .
what is it?
did you ... see that?
see what?
can i help you?
aaaah !
did you see someone come in here just now?
a woman?
no , i've been alone all morning .
father , would you excuse us , please?
sit down .
now you tell me you saw her !
i saw a woman but it could have been anyone .
you may be suffering from post traumatic stress disorder brought on by intense feelings of guilt .
arvin , you have walked into a church .
a place to confess .
she's alive .
she knew the alarm code .
she could have come into the house undetected .
there is a clear way to know for certain but i hesitate to suggest it .
sir , there's something i have to report .
while it appeared that my mother sent me into a trap in madagascar , in truth , she was unaware that there was any danger .
yes , i know .
i have your father's statement right here .
he told us himself this morning .
what?
a hearing has been scheduled with the joint intelligence committee .
my intention wasn't to punish my father , sir , it was to stop my mother's execution from going forward .
yes?
i'll send her down right now .
they'd like to see you in medical services .
you asked to see me?
agent bristow , i'm doctor nicholas .
what's going on?
five weeks ago you infiltrated one of your mother's labratories in taipei where you discovered a rambaldi device .
how long were you in proximity to the device?
i ... it took me about a minute to rig it with explosives .
i made it to the other side of the door but vaughn was submerged .
i don't know , maybe another minute or two .
will someone please tell me what's going on?
we believe the device is the source of the virus that infected the men in geneva .
unfortunately , you and agent vaughn may have been exposed .
i'm sorry .
we'd like to draw some blood and keep you under observation .
if sloane pages me , this is gonna be a problem .
your father's been informed .
he's covering for you .
i know .
hi .
hey .
did you close your eyes at all?
on and off .
you talk in your sleep .
no !
what did i say?
don't frost the pie ! " it seemed really important .
no idea .
you think we're sick?
i don't know .
vaughn , can i tell you something?
agent bristow , your tests came back negative for antibodies , you're free to go .
agent vaughn , your tests at this point are inconclusive .
we did find a heightened level of antibodies in your blood stream but you could simply be fighting off a cold .
we won't know for a few more hours .
you'll have to stay .
you said sark tested patient's blood at the first sign of infection .
what was the sign?
hemorrhaging from the fingernails .
it'll be fine .
your dad's hearing's in an hour , you should go .
i'll see you soon .
yeah .
agent bristow , this hearing's been convened to determine an appropriate punishment for the crimes depicted in your statement .
before we begin our inquiry , do you have anything to say?
only that despite my admission of guilt , i still firmly believe irina derevko is a threat and will prove it at her earliest possible convenience .
is that how you justify lying to your superiors , endangering other agents?
yes .
why this sudden change of heart?
deferentially , senator , my reasons are my own .
i see .
reviewing your file , i was shocked to discover how many times you've displayed behavior that at best can be characterized as rogue .
you have lost the benefit of the doubt here , sir , and your silence will not suffice .
so again , i ask you , why the change of heart?
my daughter convinced me that i acted unethically .
isn't it a fact that you knew your daughter intended to turn you in and that you beat her to the punch only by an hour in order to secure a degree of leniency from this body?
no , sir , that is not the case .
sydney bristow , my daughter ... has come to believe that when i look at her , i see the embodiment of all my flaws .
and this afternoon when i learned that she may have been exposed to a life threatening disease ,
i realized that she might die believing that .
but nothing could be further from the truth .
when i look at her , when i look at the little girl who raised herself to become one of the most extraordinary human beings and one of the finest agents i've ever had the privilege of knowing ,
i see only the promise of my own redemption .
turning myself in was the only way i could think of to make that clear to her , to prove that despite ... my limited abilities as a father , i love her more than i could ever say .
i didn't order this .
it's from the gentleman at the bar .
you okay?
yeah , clean bill of health .
apparently , i am fighting a cold .
i came by to see you after the hearing but they were still running tests .
i know , they told me you came here .
this is ridiculous , being in the same restaurant on the phone .
listen , syd , i , um , i actually came by to tell you something .
they're sending your father to prison .
you're kidding?
it gets worse .
douglas decided your mother's immunity agreement was never binding .
they're going to carry out her death sentence anyway .
her execution goes ahead tomorrow at eight am .
welcome back to washington , senator .
ed , you missed the exit .
hello?
no !
no !
hey !
you're making a blg mistake !
sorry about the detour , senator ...
what the hell are you doing? ! ... but i need two minutes of your undivided attention .
i don't care what point you want to make !
i'd like you to consider dropping the charges against my father and honor my mother's immunity agreement .
you can't be serious .
i recognize how indecisive this sounds
that's a full understatement , my dear !
i turned her in under false pretenses and i've come to believe my father was protecting me .
his interest are irrelevant , it's his decisions that matter .
i'm sorry , agent bristow , but my colleagues and i have zero tolerance for anyone who would lie to their own government , especially in this day and age .
and your mother?
well , she's had it coming for twenty years .
now given what you've been through ,
i'm willing to forgive your little misstep tonight .
would you kindly drop me off at home?
wait in the car .
how did you persuade douglas to reverse himself?
i told him i have a secret only you and i know about .
a secret that sloane told you in confidence that poses such a threat to national security that we couldn't trust even the cla to contain it .
what secret is that?
one of your colleagues a united states senator is working for the alliance .
we have evidence of wire transfers totaling 6 . 3 million .
to whom?
that's what we're trying to find out .
but without my mother and father , i'll be forced to hand over the investigation to the fbl .
there's no senator in the alliance's pocket .
you lied .
i'm not proud of what i did .
i may not agree with your decision to interact with your mother ,
sydney , but i will from now on respect that it is your decision to make .
they're bringing in your mother now .
i'm sure you'll want to see her .
