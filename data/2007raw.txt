too bad your teeth are still off .
my teeth have to be crooked to match your overbite .
if i look better than you , no one will believe we" re best friends .
i don" t have an overbite .
look at your reflection .
it" s natural and cute .
this is cute , too .

i have no plan .
i have nothing , no goal in life .
olle" s cock is tiny , anyway .
i don" t care , it was a cock .
you get to be with me all summer .
that" s cool , right?
yeah , it feels like i won first prize in a raffle .
we" re just going to hang , and nothing is going to happen .

i don" t have a ticket .
l" m moving , so i forgot to buy one .
i mean , i usually have one , but ...

l" m sorry .
it" s just very funny .
l" m sorry .

you don" t have to say we" re dating .
you don" t get it , paulie .
they could come at any time .
lf i tell you no ...
but i can" t live there !
could you hurry up?
i knew it , you little rat .
you" ve stolen tons of toilet paper .
so?
you" ve got loads of it .
why are you stealing?
l" m borrowing .
you could ask !
can i take some toilet paper?
no?
well , pardon me .
here .
wipe your ass forever .
i don" t need that many .
one is fine .
you retard !
i think your mom will notice .

where are you girls going?
we" re just getting ready to leave .
aren" t we having tea?
no , we" re not .
seriously .
paulina , why are you ...
oh , just cut it out .
you have such a nice home .
i could move in here .
i don" t know what you mean .
are you in town for the summer?
yes , i hope so .
but i have nowhere to live .
she" s staying with a friend .
paulina told me you live with your boyfriend .
i used to , but he left town .
and the apartment wasn" t his , so ...
so , now you have no place to live .
aren" t you thinking of buying an apartment?
lf i had the money , i guess i could .
not everyone has money .
maja , do you want to go with paulina to riding camp?
riding camp?
it" s a family tradition .
l" m not going to riding camp .
yes , you are going !
don" t save any food for me .
l" il eat out .
don" t you think it" d be better ... ... if you at least tried to find somewhere else to live .
you can" t live with a bunch of 24 year old guys .
with their morning erections , and stuff .
i really don" t mind morning erections .
but it" s hard to be a girl .
know what i mean?
no .
i haven" t felt that before , it" s really weird .
how do you mean?
i can" t explain it .
it" s just a feeling , a new one .
so , you want to be a guy?
no , but l" d much rather be living in a better world .
so you can just wait for olle .
l" m not .
he" s going to call ...
nope ... on sunday .
i just mean , what if he" s the one .
there" s no such thing .
just " the one right now " .
want to see it?
yeah , the stupid " english patient " .
it" s no good?
have you seen it?
but you" il get great muscle tone from riding a pony all damned day .
muscles enough to fuck you real hard between your legs .
and you can drag your cart and bags .
here" s the deal with olle .
he had a destination .
he had a plan , and wasn" t all talk .
he" d do things .
so , this is where you " live " .
hey , are you listening?
so , where do you keep your clothes?
maybe l" m the same way , and should be doing stuff .
you know , travel , find myself ...
there" s bread on your bed .
mattias made it .
it said " maja " , but i ate the j.
he baked for you?
on his own?
and it says " maja "?
what" s this?
where he keeps his drugs , i guess .
his drugs , you guess "?
here , smell his drugs .
you knew his drugs were there .
hey , look !
don" t touch me with that thing .
i swear , l" il kill you .
those are some tidy guys you live with .
hi .

no , it was just ...
you" re all soaked .
l" il just change my clothes .
you" re all soaked " .

or aren" t you going to let me?
you do whatever you want .
l" m just trying to watch the movie .
i can help .
yeah , making tea is hard .
i can well imagine greater cuts ...
does it bother you?
what?
moving in here?
no .
it" s okay , really .
does it bother you?
l" m sorry about last night .
i didn" t mean to barge in like that .
l" m watching this .

sounds to me like you" re damned interested in mattias .
if olle had been home , these weird things wouldn" t have happened
what weird things?
just everything .
it just feels like everything we do or say here and now
is sort of important somehow .
that it will remain , be written down somehow .
that" s him , with the office couch .
are you sure?
mattias , that guy over there groped maja .
the one in the shirt .

yes , exactly .
or ...?

you looked familiar .
where are you from?
sweden .
from a local group .
which one?
in skrholmen .
skrholmen?
i didn" t know there was one there .
it" s brand new .
we" re doing a rally soon .

in the main square .
we wanted to see if nicke gustavsson could come .
we haven" t set a date , what with being new .

l" m glad to see you .

no one knows you" re polish .
why didn" t mattias come?
he" s been difficult to get going after gothenburg .
how come?
well , he was ...
i think he took it hard .
he was right next to the guy who was shot .
really?
yeah .
i think it" s a trauma .
now , before dinner is served
we" re going to hear a speech from our leader niklas gustavsson .
damn .
who is it?
we aren" t against immigrants , we just think it" s gone too far
when sweden can" t take care of it" s own people .
if they think we" re holding a meeting in skrholmen ...
we make them come , so maybe they realize there are good people there .
right , we just go tell them
what we think of their immigration policy .
what a great idea !
gustavsson is a smurf dick .
long , thin and blue .
but the idea sucks .
it" s does not !
you gotta do good to change things .
it" s totally cool .
come on !
lt" s stupid .
that idiot gustavsson is having an operation at my hospital .
seriously?
let" s take him .
what do you mean?
when he" s in recovery ... ... we get him .
what do you mean , " get him "?
kidnap him .
what do you mean , " kidnap "?
we can" t just waltz in and grab him .
you need a plan .
suck my dick !
what do you mean , " kidnap "?
i know every corner of that hospital .
i can find out anything there .
let" s take him to the greek society in skrholmen .
what a great idea .
i love it .
alright , let" s do it !
let" s do it !
what?
for real?
okay !
lf everyone" s doing it , i guess ...
alright , buddy !
i read in a yoga book that your soul feels like your anus .
it says your anus needs sun .

we just borrowed him .
why do you have him?
what are you talking about?
come with me .
stop it .
what a dick .
what are you on?
how you doing there , kid?
what do you think your parents thought of that?
what did they think?
johnny , you have to switch clothes with niklas .
i mean , you" re homeboys now , after you defended him in skrholmen .
you" ve been nominated racist of the year .
gimme five , johnny .
what a mess , man .
the cops are on us .
what did you say?
the cops are on us .
stop .
are you nuts?
drive !
drive !
relax .
drive !
l" m driving , johnny .
i can" t do time .
drive !
l" m driving , damn it .

maja , i have 28000 in unpaid bills .
what?
since i quit my job , l" ve been broke .
and the bills just keep coming .
really?
that" s insane .
28000 .
want to see them?
can you show them?
there" s several from the payment enforcement agency .
why haven" t you said anything?
have you tried to pay it?
l" ve got babylon disease .
what is that?
you talk about it all the time .
why don" t you explain it?
alright , l" il explain .
it" s like this .
my life is arranged so i don" t have to be intelligent , to think .
l" m controlled , a consumer .
like when i read a paper or watch tv
that" s something created to make me think that i know what" s going on .
i should be amused by talk show hosts
and identify with at least one character on " friends " .
i live in a country that" s supposedly neutral .
which means letting nazis come straight through , but quietly .
my friends are from the same tired social group .
we wake up and go to a job because we have to be there .
because we have to be part of the production .
our lives in the western world are designed
to make us feel anxiety and pain , to make us feel like shit .
babylon keeps feeding us short term solutions .
like anti depressants .
is that why you don" t pay bills?
fuck you .
fuck you .
sorry .
i understand what you" re saying , but ...
don" t you want to live?
yeah , but not like this .
being billed by people who don" t care about me .
l" m tired of being a consumer , tired of the profit motive .
i don" t know what to do about it .
i quit my job , so we can take your bills
and build a hut in the woods , live there and grow potatoes .
mattias .
what?
hi .
anders svensson called and told me he was here .
we" re his friends .
you" il have to wait a bit .
how long do we have to wait?
i can" t answer that .
thank you very much .
you" re welcome .
he" s gone completely ...
must" ve hit his head .
completely insane .
hi .
that was the craziest thing .
are we going?
so , what happened?
it was completely insane .
since we helped him from those guys who were going to beat him
which is all he remembers , nothing happened .
and he probably didn" t want anyone to know about the growth on his ass .
that" s like he" s showing his real colors .
i really mean it .
let" s get out of this place before i pee on the wall .
before you get a cop up your nose .
are you okay?
hi .
there you are .
you" ve got a visitor .
i mean , it" s ...
hi .
hi .
hello .
hi .
how have you been?
it" s been great .
it" s been six weeks .
hi .
but , yeah , it" s been really good .
damned nice .
so , what" s it been like living here?
well ...
do you want something to drink?
yes , please .
can you believe olle showed up now?
but it" s pretty cool .
my problem is who i make out with tonight .
not olle , cause he" s not at all my type .
you and mattias are my type .
l" d love for the three of us
to take a cab together from here .
cut it out , paulie .
just shut up for once .
we both know it" s not true .
i could be in love with you .
cheers .
cheers .
what" s the matter?
i can" t take it .
take a walk .
take it easy .
this is maja" s thing , okay?
wait , maja .
what" s the matter?
what" s the matter?
are you pissed?
no .
no , i was before , but l" m just tired of being bored .
it was just boring .
let" s have fun .
want to go to my place?
no .
what" s the matter?
olle , i ...
i don" t think ...
i don" t think we can go home now .
i think ...
i don" t think this is going to work .
how do you mean?
i just got home .
no you didn" t .
you" ve been here a week .
and you didn" t call me .
i had things to sort out .
that" s why i came .
you came for the party , not me .
i came to the party to be with you .
it" s this that l" m tired of .
i leave the party without bitching , because i want to go with you .
what the hell is your problem?
just chill out , will you?
come on ...
just leave , then .
alright , i will .
maja ...
hi .
are you sleeping here?
i know you" re in love with mattias , maja .
since you are , why don" t you tell him?
do something .
i promise you have nothing to lose .
i know .
you" re right .
why is everyone ...
why am i so damned scared all the time?
you" re not the only one that" s scared .
it" s not easy being human .
i mean , look at me .
even though you" re living in the west , with luxury problems .
not knowing what to wear , what to do for a living .
you know?
in the end , i think all you want
is someone that sees you .
that sees your things .
someone to see who you are .
someone that can see that you can be small , too .
you understand?
i understand .
what are you thinking?
what do you think?
me?
hi , it" s me .
too bad you" re not home , i wanted to ...
i just wanted to say that ...
well ...
i want you to know ... ... that i get it .
i get the whole thing , what you" re talking about .
but i think it can get better , because ...
just think about the fact that we" ve met .
it feels like that could be
the remedy for the entire babylon disease thing .
l" m in love with you .
i think .
and that feels good .
aw , shit !
hey , you dick !
lt" s the racist .
come on !
the babylon disease
