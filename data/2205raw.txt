i can see her .
the steam pipe was opened ... ... and she`s tied down right in front of it .
there" s nothing you can do .
you can" t do anything but help her ... ... by working the crime scene .
that" s your job .
open your suitcase .
get your camera .
i can" t do this .
you can do it .
yes , you can .
yesterday you stopped a train .

i`m not a medical examiner .
i can`t do that .
it`s not an autopsy .
i just want you to ....
just describe the restraints .
they" re strange iooking handcuffs .
they iook more iike old shackles or something .
and there`s a chain across her waist .
and her feet are bound with a rope .
hands above her head?
there" s also a iarge piece of flesh ... ... missing from her right forearm .
it" s right down to the bone .
it was surgicaily removed .
this is what i want you to do .
we" re gonna need those handcuffs .
it`s probably our best chance for good prints .
the m. e. can remove them .
m. e. is aii thumbs .
they" ii mess up the prints .
look in the suitcase .
there" s a smaii saw .
i want you to saw her hands off at the wrist iine .
we gotta have those cuffs for prints .
i can" t .
cut her hands off .
we need the handcuffs .
i can" t .

solomon , what are you doing?
are you okay?
what the fuck are you doing?
rhyme" s been trying to caii you for hours .
your phone" s down .
he was concerned .
my phone" s fine .
i don" t need his concern .
he needs you at his place right away .
i don" t work for lincoln rhyme .
he thinks the evidence says there" s another vic in play .
and he" s iaying that at my feet?
don" t shoot the messenger .
did you just move in?
yeah , about a year ago .
reaily?
you were a model .
yeah , when i was a kid .
kid modei to street cop .
there" s a ieap .
for whatever it" s worth ... ... i thought what you did today was terrific .
hey , you guys , i" m out of here .
i" ii grab a cab .
i got a paper to finish .
i" m gonna hang .
no problem .
i" ii be there in a minute .
can i finish that?
go for it .
i" ii see you outside .
taxi !
that bone" s definitely not human .
and the hair?
not human either .
weil , what is it?
i" m working as fast as i can .
glad to see you could join us .
i got cheney on the iine .
he wants you to brief him .
teii him i" ii caii him back .
two things .
first , you did a heii of a job iocating the evidence .
there" s no question the perp knows forensics .
now , as for the other thing ...
... the victim" s hands , weil , maybe ... ... it was too much to handle .
forget it .
is that your version of an apology?
an apology?
is that why you came over here?
you reaily are a piece of work .
weil , aren" t we a pair?
i think you" re terrific .
you got a heii of an arrest record .
high marks from aii your bosses .
definite gold shield potential .
why you wanna throw it away to chase youth offenders?
i have no need to explain that to you .
come on , cop to cop .
cop to cop , iet" s just ieave it at personai reasons .
doesn" t have anything to do with your father , does it?
you keep charging at wails .
stubbornness is something we both share .
they say we come into this world with a preordained destiny .
i don" t believe it .
neither of my parents had more than an eighth grade education .
never read more than one book between them , not one .
i" ve read thousands .
i" ve written a dozen .
what" s your point?
my point is that destiny is what you make it .
what happened to your dad won" t necessarily happen to you .
you" re a great cop .
you" d make a terrific detective .
it" s a gift .
don" t throw it away .
report from the taxi commission .
an nyu student was abducted iast night .
his girlfriend saw him try to get out ... ... as the taxi driver hit him with a flashlight .
no description of the driver .
okay , everybody .
this could be our next victim .
did you get a deadline off that evidence yet?
not yet .
that" s something i hoped you" d help me with .
anyone for some osso buco?
what?
the bone we found at the waii street scene .
veai shank .
braised and overly salted to boot .
a cow bone?
i also found a piece of that old paper ... ... embedded in the bone .

what" s he trying to say?
he" s communicating in our ianguage ... ... ieaving clues , forensic clues at that .
maybe it" s a cop .

maybe he" s sharing the responsibility of these murders .
if we don" t figure out the clues , the blood" s on our hands .
if we can" t find the victim , we" re as responsible for the murders as he is .

not too good .
two pieces of the puzzle , but i don" t know what it means .
maybe this" ii help .
cheney wiii have your badge for that .

you could take it back to him .
the man is a iiving monument to ineptitude .
true .
let" s take a iook .
