hello , matthew , what are you doing here so late?
i came to get the books .
i want to study our accounts .
we've been doing very well lately .
over 200 paid admissions today .
you call that good saturday business?
if you weren't so stubborn , we'd be turning them away from here .
who cares a hang about history in wax?
there are people in the world who love beauty .
but more who want sensation , shock !
morbidly curious !
i won't cater to them .
their money is as good as anybody else's .
you should have seen them turning them away at that wax museum ... on 23rd street tonight : the eden muse .
the story's the same at madame tussaud's in london .
if you'd only listened to me  i know , matthew .
i'd put in a chamber of horrors : murder , torture , executions ... scare the life out of people .
i don't care for that kind of patronage !
you're a great artist , a genius sculptor .
i'm an ordinary businessman who wants a quick return on his investment .
i've put $20, 000 in this historic peep show of yours .
i could use that to better advantage .
all right , matthew .
i've known for some time you wanted to dissolve our partnership .
i may be able to accommodate you .
how?
a friend is bringing sidney wallace , the art critic , to see my work tonight .
wallace is rich , and i think i might persuade him to buy you out .
that sounds interesting .
i'll want a profit on my investment .
yes , matthew .
i understand .
you leave everything to me , and i promise you it will be
that should be they , now .
i'll wait in the office .
i've heard of wallace .
he has a pot of money .
if he likes your stuff , put a stiff price on it .
does jarrod live here?
yes , he has a room upstairs .
you'll like him , sidney .
he speaks your language .
please come in .
i'm happy to see you , bruce .
i thought you wouldn't come on such a bad night .
we were delayed .
he had to be at a gallery .
mr. sidney wallace .
professor jarrod .
a pleasure .
for me also , professor .
that title was bestowed on me when i became an exhibitor .
it has little to do with my real work .
if you come , i will show you what that work is .
the visit of such a distinguished critic ... may cause my children to become conceited .
to you , they're wax .
but to me , their creator , they live and breathe .
here we have two great lovers from the past .
cleopatra , queen of egypt , and mark antony .
their last meeting .
you'll recall , antony , believing cleopatra to be dead ... killed himself with his own sword .
when cleopatra found out what happened , she quickly followed her lover .
you noticed how cleverly the hair is mounted on the scalp?
yes .
how do you do that?
real hair of the proper color and texture ... is pressed into the slightly warmed wax with a scalpel ... one hair at a time .
each wave and curl of the subject's own hair is reproduced .
here's president lincoln and his assassin , john wilkes booth ... one of my few concessions to the macabre .
that's the best figure of booth i've ever seen .
you almost expect him to speak .
i wonder what he'd say .
i'm sure he'd rant a bit .
even after he shot lincoln and jumped from the president's box onto the stage ... he couldn't resist turning to the audience and taking a bow .
i found him a very stubborn person .
stubborn?
unbelievably .
for days i argued with this fellow before he posed the way i wanted him to .
you mean , he talked back to you?
of course .
it's not easy to shut an actor's mouth .
these groups are like dimensional paintings of the old masters .
this is not only a great show , it's an art exhibit .
that's what i told you .
here we have joan of arc , a favorite subject of mine .
i understand that .
it's beautifully done .
thank you .
i've done her over a dozen times , and still she doesn't complain .
what was wrong with her?
there are no authentic portraits available ... so sculptors and painters have to work from models .
i've never found the right one , but i will someday .
it's a shame to race through this exhibit .
these figures should be studied .
you're very kind .
my creations have some merit , i suspect ... but in bringing back to life the lovely marie antoinette ...
i feel i've done my best work .
i've never seen anything so exquisite .
people say they can see my marie antoinette breathe ... that her breast rises and falls .
look at her eyes , they follow you wherever you go .
she is very real to me .
you know , her eyes do follow you .
they're made of glass , more's the pity .
the exact size and color of the original .
they're inserted into the sockets from inside ... by way of the hollow neck , before the head is attached to the body .
forgive me , my dear , for discussing your intimate secrets .
i'm sorry .
i lose myself at times .
if people knew what you have inside these walls ... you couldn't accommodate the crowds .
what you need here is exploitation , more advertising .
that's what i've been telling him .
my partner wouldn't agree .
he's not happy here .
he wants to invest in something else .
would you become a partner in this venture?
would you buy him out?
i might be interested if my lawyers approve and the price is right .
with your support , i'd do wonders .
i'd make any sacrifice .
unfortunately , i'm leaving for egypt .
i'm financing some excavations there .
i'll be back in three months , then we can discuss
you make me very happy .
you intrigue me , professor .
i believe we'd get along together .
good night .
good night .
and i'm grateful to you  it's all right .
thank you for your visit and your encouragement .
i'll see you in three months .
good night .
good night .
mr. wallace is a great art critic , darling .
you heard what he said .
does he make you happy?
of course you'd say that .
but i don't care about success .
the world will acknowledge your beauty .
and you , my friends ...
cleopatra , mark antony , lincoln , joan of arc , all of you .
how would it suit you to be famous again?
i know it'll please you , you conceited devil .
it was like you to get yourself shot down in a burning barn .
couldn't do it without a spotlight , could you?
do you really hear what they say?
of course .
a man has to be a little nuts to be a good showman .
the sooner i'm out of it , the better .
you'll be out soon , matthew .
mr. wallace returns from egypt in three months .
he'll be ready to talk business then .
i heard him .
that's no good for me .
but , surely
i want to buy something .
it'll pay off in a big way and three months is too late .
what guarantee do i have that he won't go cold on the deal?
sorry .
it's the best i could do .
i can do better .
how would you like to split $25, 000 with me?
and you call me crazy?
you ever thought of what would happen if we had a fire here?
in the cellar , there are six barrels of wax .
wax is paraffin based .
it's highly inflammable .
this place would go up like a paint factory .
burn?
burn all my people?
do you think i'm a murderer?
stop dreaming .
these dummies are insured for $25, 000 .
that's $12, 500 for each of us .
you'd have money to begin again .
i'd rather die myself than see my friends destroyed .
i won't let you do it , and i'll kill you if you try .
don't be stupid .
all you have to do is to strike a match and the thing is done .
yes , my friend was a genius .
a great artist .
only i could understand him .
we were like that , cathy .
just like that .
couldn't they ever find him after the fire?
not a sign of him .
the place burned like a paint factory .
like a volcano .
he was such an impractical fellow .
but i still loved him .
had i been there , i might have saved him .
you might have gotten burned yourself .
yes .
such is life .
no matter how much we lose , we must still go on living .
was there any insurance on the wax museum?
yes .
i had a little difficulty about that .
according to the partnership agreement ... the money was to go to the survivor of the others .
the insurance company insists upon proof of my partner's death .
they always want a corpse .
but they settled finally .
this afternoon , in fact .
certified check .
i got it cashed .
the money is in my safe .
you know what that means , baby?
no , what?
that little trip i was talking to you about ....
you're such a card !
how much did you get? $25, 000 .
where would you like to go?
atlantic city?
niagara falls .
we can get the license in buffalo .
license?
yes .
you know .
legitimate .
why not?
it might be fun .
waiter , my check .
pull it tighter , sue .
i want a waist like anna held .
if i pull it any tighter , you're not going to be able to breathe .
that's all right .
i don't need much breath , anyway .
if a girl don't watch her figure , the men won't .
wasn't that the man you were to marry?
yes , but he hung himself instead .
matty was such a card .
where is your new friend gonna take you tonight?
the hoffman house for dinner , and then to a vaudeville show .
that sounds like fun .
he's a free spender , all right .
little bit older than i like 'em , but very distinguished looking .
is he nice?
awfully nice .
a real gentleman , except when he has had a couple of drinks .
that's to be expected .
i'm moving up .
i'm moving up in the world , honey .
no girl ever hits the jackpot till after she passes 14th street .
is that how it goes?
sure .
look at me .
not too long ago , i was down on delancey street .
and tonight i'll be right up there among the bright lights on 23rd .
now , when you get up there tonight , don't drink too much .
don't worry , i won't .
he keeps trying to pour the liquor into me , but i always manage to keep my head .
after all , now that i'm going regular with a swell ...
i got social obligations .
you know how it is when a fella ....
no , of course you don't know .
you're not like me .
you never could be .
you got all the brains and all i've got is what i've got .
you know , i'm surprised you even talk to me .
what nonsense .
you've been so good to me .
why not?
a girl needs a friend when she is down on her luck .
holy smoke !
look at the time .
i've got to hurry .
did you find a job yet?
no , but they need a hat check girl at the silver slipper ... and i've got an appointment with the manager .
i know that fellow .
watch out for him .
but why?
what's the matter with him?
nothing much .
long as you know how to duck .
that kind?
yes .
did you eat today?
i had everything i needed .
to hear you tell it .
besides , you're behind in your room rent .
mrs. flannigan will wait for me .
don't count on that .
the old buzzard almost locked me out once .
there .
if i don't sizzle him tonight , i might as well give up .
he's picking me up in a hansom cab .
no trolley for him .
he is real society .
all i've got is 50 cents .
buy some dinner with it .
no , cathy .
come on .
my friend will give me some money tonight and then i'll stake you .
i don't need any mad money .
i never get mad .
good luck tonight at the silver slipper .
and don't forget to duck .
just a moment , miss allen .
what are you coming in so quietly for?
i didn't want to disturb anybody .
did you get the job?
no .
why not?
i had trouble with the boss .
you'll get your money .
cathy promised to lend me some tonight when she comes home .
you better get right up there , then .
because she's home now .
couldn't it wait until tomorrow?
no , it could not .
if you want to sleep in this house tonight , you get that money .
all right , i'll try .
cathy , it's sue .
are you there?
i tell you , the scream came from up there .
let's look into it .
usually there's a policeman at the corner .
that's why i'm blowing the whistle .
cabbie !
what is it , mother?
it's sue .
this is a surprise .
i was just thinking about ....
what happened to you , dear?
what's wrong?
wait a minute .
what happened?
wait a minute .
what is it?
cathy gray , the girl in my rooming house , was murdered tonight .
what?
i found her .
the man who killed her was there in the room .
i tried to get away from him .
but he followed me into the street .
no , scott , please don't go out there .
it's all right , darling .
don't be frightened .
it's all right now , dear .
you're safe .
who found the body?
one of my roomers .
a friend of cathy's .
sue allen .
which one is miss allen?
she isn't here .
where is she?
i don't know .
we heard her scream .
when we went looking for her , she was gone .
are all your roomers in?
all but miss allen .
lt. brennan will want a statement from each one of you .
see that nobody leaves the house .
when i arrived at the rooming house , this girl had been dead for several hours .
the immediate cause of death was strangulation .
the mark of a cord is still on her throat .
my examination indicated she'd probably been given a drug .
you were right .
what was it?
something to make her sleep .
veronal , perhaps .
i'll know as soon as we hear from the laboratory .
how long would it take for such a drug to work?
that would depend upon how much it was diluted .
it was probably given to her in a drink .
that's how it's usually done .
business is slow tonight .
what?
three suicides and two murders ....
and a traffic case since 9 : 00 .
the fellow got hit by an automobile .
i didn't think they go fast enough to hurt anybody .
give them time .
they're getting better every day .
i hope you like it here , honey .
it's the best we've got .
what's the matter with this one?
you'll get used to that .
the embalming fluid makes them jump .
one of the suicides .
just like a woman .
they always have to have the last word .
why didn't you tell the police?
she's doing that .
last night was the time to do it .
she was in no condition to come here .
this is murder , mrs. andrews .
the body of cathy gray was stolen from the morgue last night .
no .
why would anyone want to take cathy's body?
we are as much in the dark as you are .
we had a similar case before .
matthew burke .
i read about that .
and patterson , a deputy city attorney disappeared .
we found no trace of him .
we could've laid our hands on that man that you saw last night .
that's the strangest description i've ever heard .
no human being can look like that .
sure you didn't imagine it?
i did see him .
just as i described him to you .
he was incredible , but very real .
could he be the man who took miss gray to dinner?
that's impossible .
she told me that he was very good looking .
that's what the landlady said , it's a man with gray hair .
we have no suspects fitting your description .
if we did , we'd have him in the crazy house .
don't leave town .
where can we find you?
27 lafayette street .
miss allen will stay in our home .
make sure of that .
she's our only witness .
that's all .
thank you .
how do you do?
i received a letter giving this address and signed professor jarrod .
but i know the professor's dead .
can you tell me who wrote this letter?
my name is sidney wallace .
it's so good ....
forgive me .
shaking hands with me is an unpleasant experience .
my hands are no longer hands .
sit down , please .
this is igor .
he's a deaf mute .
he is one of my assistants .
i'm going to open another wax museum under a different name .
it startled you , seeing me here?
i thought you were dead .
jarrod is dead .
i am a reincarnation .
when i saw your signature , i thought somebody was fooling me .
i don't understand how you escaped the fire .
it's a mystery to me , too .
all i can remember is that i tried to get out of my studio .
i failed at first , but here i am .
what a frightful experience .
somehow i made my way to the house of a doctor .
i still have my limbs but they won't bear the weight of my body .
as for my hands , they are no use to me now .
as a sculptor , i can't control them .
but they serve for ordinary functions .
but you're beginning again?
with the help of my pupils , yes .
i'm rebuilding my exhibition from the ground up .
i'm going to give the people what they want : sensation , horror , shock .
send them out in the streets to tell their friends ... how wonderful it is to be scared to death .
i'll show you one of my subjects .
do you recall the case of kemmler , the first man to die in the electric chair?
yes .
igor is working on a model of his head .
he has a strange obsession , this mute of mine .
every head he models takes on the shape of his own face .
but in this case i humor him , for he somewhat resembles kemmler .
crimes of violence will be reproduced in wax ... and exhibited while they are still fresh in the public mind .
what do you think of my scheme?
it will succeed , commercially , though it doesn't sound like you .
have you turned your back on beauty?
no .
but i can no longer create it .
i never forgot your marie antoinette .
nor have l .
she will be the leading lady of my new exhibition .
but i must find her first .
find her?
a model , i mean .
yes , there will be beauty , for contrast , if nothing else .
but each subject must be taken from life .
how can i convince my audience they're alive , if i don't believe it myself?
i have something i think will interest you .
you follow igor down into the basement .
i have to go my own way .
here we are .
interesting , isn't it?
one of my pupils is about to dip a body into a bath of wax .
body?
yes .
the bodies are constructed separately ... to exact specifications , of reinforced plaster of paris .
this is leon , another one of my pupils .
mr. wallace .
how do you do?
the wax is melted in the cauldron you see above the vat ...
liquefied and brought to a boiling point ... so that it will distribute itself evenly over the body .
the head and hands , tinted by my own secret process ... are attached to the body after it is covered with its skin of wax .
now watch .
i wondered how it was done .
it's a method of my own .
crude but adequate .
have you found a home for your museum?
this is it , the building upstairs .
we'll continue to use the cellar as the workshop ... it's an excellent location , and the building can be leased at the right price .
i have some capital , but i need more . $30, 000 , at least .
that's why i've asked you to come here .
i'll think it over .
good .
she is about right , now .
leon , drain out the surplus , and let her cool .
leon , open up number 27 .
come this way , please .
i told you that i intend to exhibit scenes of violence .
here is an interesting subject .
a mystery they are still talking about .
all right , leon .
i saw his picture in the papers .
this is a remarkable likeness .
but it can't be a death mask .
no , it's from memory .
he hanged himself in an elevator shaft .
come in , ladies and gentlemen .
see the house of wax .
see the chamber of horrors .
here's three lovely ladies right over here .
would you like to see little egypt?
here she is , ladies and gentlemen , little egypt , queen of the harem ... who danced at the colombian exposition in chicago in 1893 .
is she wax , or is she flesh and blood?
see the world in wax , the hall of fame .
the chamber of horrors .
a cultural exhibition that'll enlighten you , amaze you ....
i think i could do that .
no , you couldn't .
i could , too , if i took my stays off .
don't do that .
don't talk that way .
watch it , young lady .
careful , sir .
keep your head down or i'll tap you on the chin .
look out .
that's a becoming hat you're wearing .
i wonder if i could clip a flower off it .
hold steady , now .
don't move your head .
or you'll lose the powder off your nose .
there is someone with a bag of popcorn .
close your mouth , it's the bag i'm aiming at .
not your tonsil .
here she comes .
look at that , it's in the bag .
see the lovely centers of ancient times , ladies and gentlemen .
beauties who died and tortured out on the block .
visit our chamber of horrors .
and pass the time of day with notorious murderers ... who killed with the rope , the knife , and the axe .
thrills , chills , a lot of dirt for a price within the reach of all .
i hope you don't think i've gone too far hiring this fellow to bring people in .
he makes it sound like a sideshow .
try him for a week or two .
once we're established , we won't need that sort of thing .
he looks like a real man .
you'd be surprised .
it's a real man .
sorry .
the historic figures i'm about to show you will be more interesting ... when i tell you that their faces were molded from the original death masks ... now in the possession of certain european governments .
first , we have anne boleyn ... second wife of henry the vill , and the mother of queen elizabeth .
with the executioner henry borrowed from the french king ... so that anne's head would be cleaved from her body without too much pain .
he was a thoughtful husband , henry .
it was he who invented the short cut to divorce .
a very bad pun , i'm afraid .
here is another scene of historic violence .
charlotte corday and marat ... one of the leaders of the french revolution .
the lady found him taking a bath , and plunged the knife into his heart .
quelle femme terrible !
what a shocking thing .
yes , wasn't it?
the poor man was dreadfully embarrassed .
the exhibits in this room will be added to ... from time to time as various crimes are committed .
you'll read about them in your newspaper ... and see them enacted here in waxen tableaux .
by the way , ladies ... this is how your ancestor carried his bride across the threshold .
during the french revolution ... a certain doctor invented a labor saving device ... to take the place of a headmen's ax .
so successful was this machine ... at cutting off the heads of the french aristocrats ... they named it after its creator .
here it is , the bloody guillotine .
i don't think i can stand it .
pull yourself together .
twelve years ago , the electric chair was first used in new york state .
here we have an authentic reproduction ... of the execution of william kemmler on august 3 , in 1890 .
kemmler killed without mercy and 2, 000 volts sent him to a higher court .
the torture of the rack .
in this case ...
lady anne askew , an english noblewoman accused of treason ... is being put to the question .
needless to say , she admitted she was a traitor .
who wouldn't , under that sort of pressure?
is it your corset?
it's my stomach .
it turned over .
mine turned over , too .
now , my friends ... we have that jolly old gentleman known as the modern bluebeard .
like his namesake , he killed not wisely , but too well ... and did away with eight wives .
smelling salts , ladies?
help yourself .
thank you very much .
next door to him , we have a mystery of more recent date .
matthew burke , the stockbroker .
he was found hanged in the elevator shaft of the building where he had his offices .
was it murder or suicide?
only time will tell .
foul deeds will rise , though all the world o'erwhelm them , to men's eyes .
thank you .
you like him?
he looks exactly like my uncle rufus .
they ought to have a policeman like this in the eden muse .
haven't you been there?
no .
from what i see in the papers , this museum is even better .
we'll soon find out .
meet my good friend , mr. sidney wallace .
miss sue allen .
a pleasure .
i heard you were in town .
you should have looked me up .
i expect great things of scott .
he's one of our most promising sculptors .
has he been working hard?
he never knows when to stop .
sue's been posing for me .
lndeed , lovely subject .
she's not a professional model .
she's a guest .
our mothers were great friends .
have you been inside?
is it exciting?
if anything , too much so .
but i'm sure it'll catch on .
jarrod , the owner , is a good friend of mine .
you'll be interested in him .
let's go in , shall we?
these figures are excellent .
i thought you'd agree with me .
they're not only well done but they're good theater .
what do you think?
i know they are only wax ... but they seem so real , just looking at her makes my neck hurt .
wait till you see the chamber of horrors .
i told jarrod he should have a nurse on duty there .
he lost the use of his hands .
who did these figures?
his pupils , but he supervised the work .
his is the mastermind .
surely knows his anatomy .
sue , what is it?
are you crying?
what's wrong , miss allen?
a dear friend of mine was murdered and i found her .
she means cathy gray , the girl whose body was stolen from the morgue .
what made you think of her now?
that's her face .
i know every line of it .
i wake up at night and i see it .
i can't get it out of my mind .
perhaps that's the reason you see a resemblance .
it's more than a resemblance .
it's wax , my dear .
i know , but ....
but why should it be so like cathy?
i think i can explain that .
this is a pleasure .
you see , miss allen
i heard what the young lady said .
the figure of joan of arc is a traditional exhibit in wax museums .
it was completed just in time for our opening tonight .
you're right , my dear .
it is more than a chance resemblance .
when i create an important figure , i can't take just any face .
i saw pictures of your cathy gray in the newspaper .
her face fascinated me .
and here she is .
immortalized as the victim of an earlier event .
do you really think she'd mind?
no , i don't think she'd mind .
cathy loved to " dress up " as she called it .
she used to take fancy dresses ... and imitate the actresses she saw in the theater .
i don't think she'd mind .
then i'm forgiven?
there's nothing to forgive .
i just don't understand how it can seem so real .
that's the finest compliment i have ever received .
thank you , my dear .
did i hear your name correctly , scott andrews?
yes , mr. jarrod .
the sculptor i've been telling you about .
sidney showed me photographs of your work .
he was right .
you have great promise .
what are you doing now?
i'm doing a head of miss allen .
let me see your hands .
mine were once like that .
how i envy you .
would you be interested in some modeling for me , some originals i have in mind?
yes .
i'd be honored .
good .
come here tomorrow morning , we'll make the arrangements .
i think you'll like it .
i want you to look at this girl .
with pleasure .
who does she remind you of?
i've been wondering about that .
i haven't known her more than 10 minutes ... but there's something about her face
that haunts you as the face of my marie antoinette has haunted me .
of course .
i should have seen it at once .
a figure in wax .
mr. jarrod's greatest work .
more than wax .
she lived .
you mean i look like she did?
exactly as she did .
once in his lifetime , every artist feels the hand of god ... and creates something that comes alive .
so it was with my marie antoinette .
and i loved her .
but she is gone now .
horribly destroyed .
perhaps you would help me to bring her back .
you will come to see me?
soon?
i'd be glad to .
you'll be welcome at any time , no matter what i'm doing .
and you , mr. andrews , in the morning ....
i'll be here , very eager to begin .
it has been a very exciting day for me and i'm a little tired .
so if you'll forgive me , i'll say good night .
sidney , one moment , please .
excuse me , i'll be right back .
forget about it .
you heard what mr. jarrod said .
cathy's face was inspiration .
it's a portrait in wax .
why should it seem so real?
i hate to drag you away .
that's fine .
i'm going to work here .
we'll see it all another time .
yes , another time .
still time to see the entire exhibition , ladies and gentlemen .
get your tickets from the fine little lady in the box office and go right in .
see the world in wax and improve your mind .
see the chamber of horrors and scare yourself out of a year's growth .
not again .
what happened?
why did you scream?
i saw cathy again .
and the man who killed her was right here in this room .
i must have been dreaming .
of course you were , dear .
a lager for the gentleman .
sarsaparilla for the lady .
and two knockwurst on rye .
thank you .
enjoying yourself?
it's exciting .
do nice people come here?
of course .
these sunday matinees are very popular .
i don't know .
it doesn't seem proper , all those girls showing their talents .
you never saw a show like this in provincetown?
don't worry , your reputation is safe .
you've been worrying too much ... about wax figures and seeing monsters in your dreams .
you need something like this to bring you back to normalcy .
prosit !
remember mr. jarrod said he first saw cathy's picture in the newspaper .
yes .
what's wrong with that?
i knew her so well .
i knew every little expression and they are all there .
they would be .
the man's an artist .
there's something else i saw that night in the museum .
cathy had a habit of wearing an earring in her right ear .
she had the lobe of her right ear only pierced for that .
but that's there , too .
how could he see that in a photograph?
how can he make it so real unless ....
what?
unless it is cathy .
i'm going to take you to lt. brennan's office tomorrow .
tell him exactly what you told me here .
he's a policeman , he knows .
he'll convince you once and for all that no such thing could happen .
now relax , honey , and enjoy the show .
i know it sounds fantastic , but you asked me to tell you everything .
you can see this idea is an obsession , an unhealthy one , if you ask me .
you say jarrod is a cripple?
he uses a wheelchair .
he can walk with crutches , but not very well .
such a man came and asked to see police photographs of cathy gray .
that's how it's done .
every detail is studied to make the features true to life .
but why should joan of arc have her right ear pierced?
why not?
they wore them then .
two , not one .
lieutenant , it's not a suspicion .
it's more a kind of fear , an intuition .
intuition isn't much help in police work .
facts are what we need .
suppose you forget about it , and let us do the worrying .
you mean you'll investigate it?
of course he does .
yes , that's what i mean .
you both think i'm crazy .
we think nothing of the kind .
it was very good of you to listen and be so patient .
thank you .
goodbye .
goodbye .
thanks .
this is brennan speaking .
give me shane .
hello .
i want you to go to the city license bureau ... and check up on a man named henry jarrod .
yes , he opened a museum on 29th street , near broadway .
yes , the house of wax .
dig up all you can .
get a list of his employees and check with me here .
that's a copy of her face , all right .
but she didn't look like that when i saw her .
not so composed .
poor kid .
you know , this fellow jarrod's good .
you think miss allen's fears are justified?
heck , no .
do you?
that's wax , how could it be anything else?
leave it to a skirt to dream up a crazy idea like that .
so you did you come to see me , my marie antoinette?
or was it that you came to see?
mr. jarrod , i'm so sorry .
i know i'm not supposed to touch the figures .
you couldn't help yourself .
don't let it trouble you .
i beg your pardon , this is leon averill and igor .
how do you do?
igor isn't impolite .
he simply can't talk .
leon is an artist in his own right .
it was he who did the waxwork on the figure of joan of arc .
does she still seem real to you?
as life itself .
of course , her hair is different , but that doesn't change her face .
what puzzles me is how you can get such detail from a photo .
was cathy wearing her earrings when the police photographed her?
earrings?
i don't remember .
was she , leon?
no .
i don't think so .
the police would remove the jewelry from the body , wouldn't they?
yet you were careful to show that both her ears had been pierced for them .
yes , of course .
if i missed a detail of that sort , mr. jarrod would be most displeased .
he insists on reality .
i can understand that .
just a moment , leon .
there's something in this box i think would interest you .
open it , leon .
your mr. andrews permitted us to make a cast of the head he did of you .
leon has just finished it in wax .
do you like it?
it's sort of a shock to see your head detached that way .
i guess it's a very good likeness .
yes , and no .
andrews is clever , but like all modern sculptors ... he has too much imagination .
he would improve on nature .
what i need for my marie antoinette is you .
the real you .
nothing less will satisfy me .
will you come to see me again , my dear?
you know this fellow jarrod's quicker at finding these guys than we are?
that's what he says in his advertising .
look at that .
even the twist in the neck .
that's a case that gets me .
where is burke?
who got him?
who'd want him?
we better find out pretty quick .
did you read the blast in today's world?
yeah , it's dynamite .
the chief had me in his office this morning .
if i'm not careful , i'll be pounding a beat in the bronx .
come here , jim .
do you remember patterson , the deputy city attorney who disappeared?
sure .
does booth look like wilbur , or am i crazy?
he does a tad with the brush off his lip .
the hair is different , of course , but the features are like patterson's .
maybe he looked like booth .
i've seen dummies that look like people i know .
the caveman is a spitting image of the new commissioner .
please .
don't touch the exhibits .
can't you read the sign?
i'm sorry .
look , where'd you get the face for this guy that shot lincoln?
from photographs .
they take them at that time?
if you go to the city library ... you'll find the volume of mathew brady's photos taken during the civil war .
do you work here?
yeah .
you make these things?
some of them .
what's your name?
leon averill .
what's yours?
jim shane .
i'm an engineer on the 9th avenue el .
it was nice meeting you .
you know me .
i'm no good at names , but i don't forget faces .
if i can take the muff off of that one i might be able to place it .
it was a long time ago .
mr. wallace , i'm lt. brennan .
sgt. shane .
glad to know you .
won't you sit down?
sorry i kept you waiting .
that's all right .
this is the first time i've been asked to come to police headquarters .
what am i suspected of?
nothing .
we thought perhaps you might be able to help us .
we heard that your partner is the same professor jarrod ... whose museum on 24th street burned down some time ago .
that's true .
this professor jarrod was supposed to have been killed in the fire .
apparently , a slight mistake .
you suspect him of some criminal act?
we haven't a thing on him .
we're curious .
so is the insurance company .
what do you know about his employees?
there's scott andrews , a protg of mine .
yes , we know of him .
then there's igor , deaf mute , and leon averill , who does the wax work .
averill's an odd character .
periodical drunkard , but a fine artist .
i've seen some of his sketches .
one of the savior with his disciples .
beautiful work .
i'm afraid i haven't been much help .
you never can tell .
thank you .
please don't mention this to your partner .
i won't .
you know , i gamble on jarrod .
he's strange , unpredictable , but i think he's a man of integrity .
i'm sure of it .
thank you very much .
not at all .
good day , gentlemen .
remember i told you i knew the man with the whiskers?
do you remember that artist in sing sing who painted the last supper on his cell?
hendricks .
they called him a genius and gave him a parole .
but when they turned him loose , he became a drunk .
he broke parole a year ago .
we've had him on the wanted list since .
carl hendricks?
that's him .
alias , leon averill .
bring him in .
can do .
a little more bitterness in that face , my boy .
remember , this fellow has been badly used by the world ... and he despises all the people in it .
deepen those lines around the corner of the mouth .
not too much .
there .
that's better .
what i wouldn't give to have those fingers of yours .
thank you , mr. jarrod .
i'm sorry i kept you so late tonight , scott .
that's all right .
miss allen is meeting me here .
it's her birthday .
we're going to celebrate at chiles '.
charming creature .
i was worried .
the shock of finding that murdered girl gave her strange ideas .
i know .
i took her to lt. brennan , he set her right .
that's very good now .
excellent .
before you go , would you mind running over to metzgers for me?
metzgers?
where they make the artificial flowers .
they're doing a background for this new group .
take a look at it .
you know what i want .
advise them on the color scheme .
i'd go myself , but it's so hard for me to get about .
i know .
i'll be glad to do it .
i'll go right now .
thank you very much .
i followed him through his bender .
sometimes , he gets the shakes so bad , you expect to see his teeth fall off .
is this all he had on him?
yes .
no money?
gold .
to wilbur patterson ....
with affection and admiration .
city attorney's office .
december 25 , 1900 .
where did you get this?
i found it .
where?
on the el .
what line?
third avenue , downtown .
when?
i don't remember , it was months ago .
book him on suspicion of murder .
no .
i found that .
i never knew the man who owned it .
i never saw him .
lock him up .
please don't put me in a cell .
i'm sick .
can't you see my nerves are all shattered?
look , please give me one little ....
can i have one little drink
you're not going to get anything until you tell us where you got this watch .
take him out .
let's go .
you shouldn't have done that , my dear .
it is cathy .
it's cathy's body under the wax .
i knew it .
i knew it all the time .
everything i ever loved has been taken away from me .
not you , my marie antoinette , for i will give you eternal life .
this is where i recreated my joan of arc .
it's an interesting process .
if you have patience with me , my dear , i'll show you how it's done .
i can't stand it .
all right .
all right , i'll tell you what i know .
patterson was killed because he looked like booth .
you killed him .
no , not l .
jarrod , at the waxworks .
his hands were no good .
he had to take subjects from life .
you helped him?
no , they were already dead .
what about burke?
he's there , too .
in wax .
he was the one who set fire to the old museum .
jarrod came out of it alive , but insane .
cathy gray?
joan of arc .
that's cathy .
she's there with all the rest of them .
the whole place is a morgue .
he'll do the same to sue allen , if he gets his hands on her .
you've got to stop him before he does any more killing .
that look of horror spoils your lovely face .
what if it should show , even through the wax?
are you in there?
where's sue?
where is she?
the end will come quickly , my love .
there's a pain beyond pain , an agony so intense ... it shocks the mind into instant oblivion .
we'll find immortality together ... for they'll remember me through you .
where's jarrod?
andrews , where's jarrod?
in the cellar .
he's got sue .
take care of him .
the people's exhibit number one .
you almost lost your head .
would you care to keep that one as a spare?
no , thank you .
we'll never forget you and your men .
thanks to you , we're still alive .
but every time i shave , i can still feel that guillotine blade .
please , let's not talk about it anymore .
yes , you're right .
mr. brennan , thank you for the use of your coat .
that was nothing .
it meant a lot to me .
when i found you weren't dressed too warmly ...
i didn't want you to catch a cold .
goodbye , mr. brennan , and thanks for everything .
bless you , mr. shane .
thank you , miss allen .
by the time this guy gets out of sing sing ... this head will grow a long beard .
