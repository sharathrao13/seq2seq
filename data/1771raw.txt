admit it .
there's cake at the veterans hall .
of course you're all welcome .
mr. garfield .
mr. oliver .
thanks for sending the glove .

yeah , there were three of us .
me and sully , and a girl named carol .
carol gerber?
that's right .
i'm hoping she'll be here .
you didn't hear about carol?
no .
i'm afraid she's dead .
i'm so sorry .
this street is where it all happened .
it's not much now .
why do we always expect home will stay the same?
nothing else does .
it's funny how when you're a kid , a day can last forever .
now , all these years seemjust like a blink .
bobby?
bobby o?
time to get a wiggle on .
wake up , bobby .
hey , wait for me !

a grownup's library card , if you please .
thanks , mom .
is?
don't .
don't you think i wanted to get you a bike?
i can't afford it .
iknow how that makes me feel?
your father didn't leave us well off .
he did leave us three months 'unpaid rent ... ... a life insurance policy that lapsed before he died .
he left a rather large stack of unpaid bills ... ... which i managed to take care of .
people understand our situation .
mr. biderman is a good example ... ... but it has not been easy .
do you get that?
your father never met an inside straight he didn't like .
what's an inside straight?
never you mind , bobby o .
don't let me catch you playing cards .
i've had enough of that .
come on , then .
that must be the new upstairs apartment tenant .
i don't trust people who move their things in paper bags .
it's slutty .
he has suitcases .
yes , but they don't match , do they?
oh , hello , folks .
i'm ted brautigan .
i'll be living upstairs .
i'm elizabeth garfield .
this is my son , robert .
nice to meet you , mr. brattigan .
tempus fugit .
it's brautigan , but ted is fine with me .
it's nice to meet you .
i hope you like it here .

i don't know .
better not be .
whoa .
just like it .
yeah , that's great .
thanks .

what's an inside straight?
something to do with gambling .
poker .
you draw a middle card .
it's dumb , strictly for suckers .
this neighborhood is getting terribly run down .
i think i'll have to move .
yeah?
is that how we answer the phone?
hi , mom .
i'm sorry .
i was just excited about dinner and all .
mr. biderman has to work late and needs me to do the same .
so birthday dinner at the colony is off .
okay , mom .
there are leftovers .
i'll be home to tuck you in .
oh , make sure to turn off the gas ring ... ... when you're done with the stove .

oh , mr. brautigan .
hi .
it's ted .
sorry .
ted'll be hard for me , but i'll try .
you going out later?
i was supposed to have a birthday dinner .
mom had to stay at work , even though she didn't want to .
are you a rich man then ... ... from your birthday gifts?
a library card?
no , an adult library card .
oh , my .
all the master storytellers waiting for you .
you know why she picked it?
because it was free .
that doesn't matter .
don't you give up on this card .
because books can be solid gold .
the great ones have gotten us through the nights for centuries .
give a writer an hour to hook you .
if he can't , find someone else .
think you can try that?
if i don't have anything else to do .
fair enough .
don't be afraid .
a tale of two cities ends with a beheading , great stuff .
lost horizon , magic and places unknown .
can't beat that .
where'd you live before you came here , mr?
ted?
some other place that wasn't as nice as this .
you l ved here long?
yes , sir .
since my dad died .
when was that sad day?
when i was 5 .
six years , huh?
you must know everything happening on this street .
sure do .
because nothing happens on this street .
six years .
that's just a blink .
someday you'll agree .
you know , ben jonson called time the " old bald cheater .
what?
ben jonson called time the " old bald cheater .
i like that .
i think i do too .
who's ben jonson?
he's an english writer , dead these many years .
brilliant , but foolish about money .
and given to flatulence .
what's flatulence?
yeah , kids always think farts are funny .
might have a job for you .
have to think about it first .
really?
yeah .
if it works out , you might get that bike .
how'd you know i wanted a bike?
all kids want bikes .
hey , mom .
i took another look at that bike .
it's a phantom , 26 incher .
real swell .
no , perfect .
perfect is more like it .
start saving those pennies .
ted?
it's me .
hi , kid .
come in .
thanks for making the skyward journey .
an icy root beer awaits you as reward .
colder , the better .
one feels them first at the back of one's eyes .
feels what?
one feels them first at the back of one's eyes .
yeah .
hey , i did like you said .
what?
i gave him a couple of hours .
oh , yeah .
lost horizon .
what do you think?
better than the hardy boys .
yeah , sure is .
tell me , bobby , how'd you like to make a dollar a week?
would i ever? !
well , my eyes are beginning to fail me ... ... and if you will read me the harwich journal every day ... ... headline stuff , sports , comics , want ads ... ... l'll give you said dollar .
what do you say?
what else?
what do you mean?
there's got to be more to it than that .
yeah , there is .
so , what's the real job?
ikeep your eyes open .
for what?
low men .
that's right , bobby .
i use the term " low " in the dickensian sense ... ... meaning dangerous .
men who stop at nothing to get what they want .
your real job will simply be ... ... to walk around the area ... ... and if you see them or find evidence on them ... ... you'll alert me immediately .
okay .
and why are they hot on your trail?
a certain something i have .
let's leave it at that .
what do they look like?
well , they wear dark clothes , dark hats .
they're kind of anonymous ... ... but you can recognize their cars ... ... loud and flashy .
when they move , they move in packs ... ... like animals closing in on the kill .
and they cast long shadows .
oh , what a world .
they're not cops , are they?
or secret agents?
are you asking me if i'm a bad guy or a commie spy?
i've scamped my share of fines ... ... and if there were library police ... ... l'd be one of their 10 most wanted .
but i never robbed a bank or stole a military secret .
so who are they?
they're thugs , relentless ... ... when they're after something .
like this something you have?
that's right .
and what they want is me , back under their control .
look out .
when they're closing in ... ... they leave strange signs in code ... ... in obvious places like telephone poles ... ... posters and notices for lost pets and lost dogs .
if i knew what they'd do , they'd never catch me .
what do i do if i see them?
run and tell me what you've seen .
i asked if you knew what was going on around here .
sure .
that's why you're my man , kiddo .
don't worry , i won't let the bogeyman get you .
bobby?
she can't know what you're thinking .
you think she can , and that's a mother's power .
mrs. garfield .
well , it's very cozy in here .
mom , ted i mean , mr. brautigan ... ... he's gonna pay me a dollar a week to read him the paper .
well , that's very generous .
do you always have boys read to you , mr. brattigan?
it's brautigan , ma'am .
and , yes , i need someone to do it .
my eyes aren't what they used to be .
and what did you do before that?
i worked up north .
various places .
well , come along , bobby .
time and tide wait for no man .
bye , mr. brautigan .
bobby .
mom , guess what mr. brautigan
something doesn't make sense .
what?
why would a man his age wanna spend time with a kid?
i don't know .
i do know that he said i must be some lucky kid ... ... to have a mom who'd let me ... ... have a grownup library card for my birthday .
i don't know .
i trust him ... ... about as far as i could sling a piano .
that's right , spoil it for me .
you never want me to get that bike .
i do , and i wish i could've gotten it for you .
but your father didn't exactly leave us well off .
it's only reading .
all right , what's the harm?
yes , yes , yes !
but only on the porch , mind , in the fresh air .
okay .
bye , bobby .
bye , carol .
sorry i'm late .
i forgot the time .
that's all right .
we're all time's captives , hostages to eternity .
ben jonson?
no , boris pasternak .
he was a russian of no account , i think .
what's going on in the world?
something scurrilous .
vice president richard m. nixon ... ... after having won the republican nomination ... ... on the first ballot , confers with henry cabot lodge
we're going for ice cream .
can't .
earning my daily bread .
afternoon , mrs. gerber .
carol .
hi , ted .
i never , ever saw a girl as special as carol gerber .
there's millions .
oh , yeah?
have you kissed her yet?
yuck !
well , you will , i promise you .
stay away .
you will .
it will be the kiss by which all others ... ... in your life will be judged , and found wanting .
are you done?
yeah .
come on , read to me .
go on .
come back here and do your job .
okay .
but you will kiss her .
oh , my god !
nice going .
get in !
get in , bobby !
come on .
come on , sully .
sully !
fbi announces new measures to combat red infiltrators .
hey , bobby .
yeah?
tell me what dale arden's wearing in flash gordon .
what is it with you and her?
when i was younger i thought she was a real hotsie totsie .
okay , before comics , we've got sports , baseball .
maury wills on the way to break ty cobb's record .
i saw cobb .
my dad saw babe ruth .
he saw him point for the home run .
against the cubs .
he told me all about it .
he tell you of nagurski's comeback game?
i know he saw it , though .
were you there?
yeah .
you and dad were at the same place .
you know about nagurski?
he was my dad's hero , that's all .
the greatest football player ever .
he came to chicago ... ... played eight years to make the bears champions .
then he retired .
when he was old , six years retired ... ... the bears brought him back .
last game of the season , they played ... ... the cardinals , sworn enemies .
the bears had to beat the cardinals to win .
nagurski wasn't supposed to play .
third string fullback .
in the first half the starter went down .
the second half there was a pileup .
oh , no .
if your dad was here he'd say he was frightened .
he was just so scared .
but why?
nagurski was in the game .
i was scared too .
we all were .
we wanted a miracle , you see , bobby .
we wanted him the way he was , the old nagurski .
we wanted him the way he was in the old days .
did he do good?
i don't wanna hear this if he didn't .
the quarterback gave him the ball ... ... and nagurski ran slowly up to the line ... ... and the cardinals crushed him .
but somehow ... ... somehow , he gained a few yards .
next play , the same .
they just kept giving the ball to the old man ... ... and the bears began to move down the field , five yards , seven more .
if he could score for us , we'd be champions again .
go on , ted !
you can't stop !
ted !
come on .
i gotta know what happened .
come on .
you know what your dad did then?
no , what did my father do?
we were all screaming .
we couldn't believe what was happening .
my god , what was it?
go on .
it was our miracle , you see , because he was crawling .
bronko nagurski was crawling toward the goal line ... ... and they did everything they could to stop him .
but nothing could stop him .
yeah , that's right , bobby .
not on that day .
not when your dad and i saw the miracle ... ... when the old man brought us home .
he scored .
he scored for us .
we were champions again .
i just knew he would .
then he was gone again , back to the north where he came from .
bronko nagurski .
bobby?
bobby o !
ted?
yeah?
well , i know the low men don't exist ... ... but if they started driving around here ... ... and the signs started appearing on the poles ....
well , we both know that couldn't happen .
but if it did ...
... would you have to go away?
it wouldn't be safe for me here .
and wishing cannot make it so .
bobby !
bobby?
this ted of yours ... ... did he say where he's from?
someplace not as nice as here , i think .
well , that doesn't tell us much , does it?
anything else?
nope .
bobby?
does he ...?
what?
nothing .
you'll tell me if anything unusual happens?
hello?
hi .
you promised .
i really need the
who was that?
nothing , honey .
just a wrong number .
son of a bitch !
i know it's you !
your mom says she's almost ready .
think ted would come?
to the fair?
don't you think we should ask?
i guess .
you do it .
i'll get sully .
okay .
do you like being beaten by a girl?
hey , no fair .
mr. biderman needs me to go in .
on saturday?
some people have to work for money .
mom , you promised .
these are just ikools .
ikools .
they cool the throat .
they're hardly cigarettes at all .
mom?
what?
can i have money for the rides?
you never stop , do you?
aren't you earning money now?
for the bike .
if you want to spend it on rides with your girlfriend , that's your business .
ted?
it's me .
you wanna come to the fair?
ted?
is everything okay?
ted , wake up .
ted , you have to help me .
ted , i don't know what to do .
they draw west now .

they draw west now , but they may be back .
ted , please .
you can't die on me .
please ....
oh , my god .

went off again , did l?
you mean , like at the fridge?
yeah .
no , way worse .
i thought you were having a fit .
it's all right .
if it happens again , don't touch me .
nobody should touch me , that's all .
sorry .
is it safe to leave you alone?
yeah .
it's okay .
okay .
mrs. gerber's taking us to the fair .
carol and i thought you might like to come .
thank you , bobby , but i think just now , it's not wise .
okay .

bobby was right .
a prodigy , huh?

i could have my money back .

i can't .
your mother won't be happy .

a lucky guess .
double your bet .
that way we all go home happy .
fine .
this one is five years of my life .
this one here .
nobody ever beat that shuffle .

it was a fluke .
you bet t was a fluke .

that's enough .
come on , bobby .
step right up !
we had a winner !
it's easy as can be .
easy peas y japanese y !
yes , yes .
don't be afraid .
when we swung out , i was afraid we would fall to our doom .
we're as safe as can be .
what do you think you're doing?
well , i thought you wanted me to .
i just wasn't ready , that's all .
okay .
bobby , do it again .
i better not .
you'll tell .
no , it'll be our secret .
hurry , before we go down .
bobby , i'm dying here .
thank you .
that was the nicest thing .
it'll be the kiss by which all others will be judged .
what?
sounded better when ted said it .
you knew , didn't you , where the queen of hearts was .
i could tell what was going on in his head .
every thought he had , i knew , and he couldn't fool me .
can you tell what's in sully's head?
sully's head's always empty .
oh , yeah?
maybe i'm thinking of getting a new glove .
you are?
well , what about that one?
want it?
are you kidding?
i love it !
then , bobby , it's yours .
it is?
i'll leave it to you in my will .
sully , you just love doing that !
i got you again .
you know , when you're young ... ... you have moments of such happiness ... ... you think you're living in someplace magical ... ... like atlantis must have been .
carol , i owe you $75 .
it's your turn .
okay .
here , give me $25 back .
twenty five .
here . $22 .
okay .
wait , no !
no !
hold on .

then we grow up ... ... and our hearts break in two .
yes !
i own it !
wait , no !
what?
no , i do .
no !
he does .
come on .
hang on .
what is it?
i wonder what it means?
it means somebody lost their pet , goofball .
come on .
yeah , but maybe it's a secret code .
what are you talking about?
fairy .
i'll take that !
i'm not a fairy !
don't talk to them !
how are your tits?
go away !
grow up , harry doolin !
the lone ranger .
hi ho , silver !
bobby , how was school?
good .
you'll never guess .
don mr. biderman has invited me to a seminar ... ... on the weekend .
real estate in the '60s .
mr. cushman and mr. dean are going , but i was amazed he asked me .
bobby?
i so want to be an agent .
this is a big chance for me .
great , when is it?
friday .
just for two nights .
you can't go to your girlfriend's .
she's not my girl
whatever .
you can't stay there ... ... so i'm gonna ask sully's mother to put you up .
that won't work .
but it has to .
they're gonna visit his grandma .
just my luck .
just my rotten luck .
why don't you ask your friend to come down for a cup of tea?
okay .
i'm sorry , mrs. garfield , but no .
i wouldn't be much of a babysitter for bobby .
but i've never been invited to a real seminar before .
you could sleep on the couch , and you could go to the diner ... ... and maybe even take in a movie .
i'll tell you what .
if bobby wants me to , i will .
bobby?
how come you get to have all the fun?
don't you want me to better myself?
yeah , but what about me?
i never get what i want .
who knows?
maybe i'll get a raise after this .
who knows what i can afford then?
i guess , if it's only a weekend .
thank you .
good .
have you ever heard of privacy?
sorry .
wait , you can't just leave .
what do i do , then?
tell me , how do i look?
you look like my mom .
the dress !
wow !
be an angel .
guess it must have cost a ton .
don't you start on that .
and in this reporter's opinion ... ... the haywood albini fight could tarnish a sterling record .
i'd back hollywood haywood any day .
ted , you listening?
their senses grow keener .
hey , kiddo , you're too young to smoke .
so how long this time?
breaking records left and right .
well , they're coming closer .
they're doing a good job of hiding from me .
haven't seen a single thing yet .
good .
i've been wrong before .
so go on about the fight .
okay .
so this old guy , albini ...?
he's gonna take on hollywood haywood tomorrow in new york .
sounds like albini's gonna get beat .
it sure does .
well , i might place a bet .
we may go into town after your mother leaves .
get a bite to eat .
see a movie .
ever hear of village of the damned? .
it's about evil , little kids taken over by alien forces .
there you go .

oh , yes .
one great , big boy against one little girl .
he's probably so afraid of you .
thought you had the heart of a lion .
he hurt me , ted .
i know .
believe me , i know .
now listen .
i've got to look at your shoulder .
understand?
i don't want to hurt you .
oh , my .
he broke my arm .
no , i think it's just dislocated .
and i think i can fix it .
are you a doctor , ted?
no , i'm not a doctor .
but as you noted , i'm very strange .
so who knows what i can do?
do you have the heart of a lion?
just close your eyes and try and relax .
bobby , give me your belt .
now , carol , do you know what pain does?
it rises and travels up the body .
that's it .
thank you .
listen to me , carol .
just listen and relax .
i want you to bite down hard on the belt .
you're going to bite down on bobby's belt and catch the pain .
now relax .
close your eyes .
ikeep them closed .
you're safe .
just breathe in .
breathe out .
that's it .
there's no pain .
just listen to my voice .
i can sense them closing in on me , bobby .
i know .
there's signs everywhere .
here we go .
bite down hard and catch here we go .
all right .
there .
ted?
it doesn't hurt anymore .
you do have the heart of a lion .
you did well , carol .
what the hell is going on in here?
mom , what happened to you?
take your hands off that little girl !
mom , he didn't do anything bad !
how dare you touch her !
he didn't hurt her !
i brought her so ted could help her !
go to your room !
and you !
you are going to jail !
what happened to you didn't happen to her .
why's her blouse open?
her shoulder's hurt !
i said , go to your room !
what bobby said was true !
let's clean you up in the bathroom .
he carried me up the hill .
ted took my pain away .
don't you touch her !
go in the bathroom .
i'm calling the police to tell them everything .
tell them what happened to you .
you weren't there .
you couldn't know .
i know .
i know you didn't realize the seminar would involve that .
and i know he's growing up while your mind is on other things .
i'm taking that child home .
and you better not be here when i get back .
be careful .
i'll be fine , don't worry .
where will you go till it's dark?
the diner near the corner pocket , i guess .
pick up my winnings later .
i want to go with you .
bobby , come inside , please .

yes , is this ... ... housitonic 5837?
yes , well , i have some information for you ... ... about brautigan .

yes .
now , there's a reward?
hello?
hello
bastards .
when your mother writes " bad " ... ... under a mental picture of someone , she writes it in ink .
i mean , i knew that , but i didn't think she'd betray me .
see , i need the money to survive ... ... and i can't go back to the corner pocket .
and i need time to think ... ... and there isn't any .
here's what you do .
write a note for me .
a note?
yeah , to the corner pocket .
i'll get you your money .
i'm not sure this is a good idea .
ted , take my hands .
don't worry .
i won't let the bogeyman get you .
hello?
can i help you?
it's about brautigan .
he took the train .
i saw him go .
stay out of this , kid .
brautigan's our business .
don't hurt him .
please don't hurt him .
go home , bobby .
ted , i got the money !
ted !
i wouldn't have missed a minute !
not a single minute !
not for the whole world !
where have you been?
i've been worried !
i'm all safe and sound .
do you have any idea what you just put me through?
you only think about yourself !
bobby  ted's gone .
i'll never see him again .
so you got everything you wanted .
happy?
there's no money .
i don't have a job .
there's plenty of money now !

i did it for you .
for your own
you lie !
you always lie .
my father was a good man and people liked him .
everyone liked him except you .
you never liked me either .
then i find a grownup friend of my own , and you know what?
i loved him .
you didn't just betray him ; you betrayed both of us .
bobby?
ted got it right .
it isn't allatlantis .
my mother got ajob outside ofboston .
and i was upset , ofcourse , but one thing ....
i wasn't afraid .
i had ted to thank for that .

this is my place now .
you can't .
this is everybody's park .
yes , i can .
little bobby garfield .
where's your fairy godfather when you need him?
that was for the gerber baby !

i'm working on it , mom .
carol , we're leaving now .
oh , no .

molly .
molly .
she had the heart of a lion .
i never heard from ted brautigan again .
not that i didn't think ofhim .
i always have ... ... and always will .
because that summer was the last of my childhood .
and though i never again saw whatpeople were thinking ... ... there was an enduring gift that he left me .
what ted did was open my eyes ... ... and let the future in .
i wouldn't have missed a minute ofit .
not for all the world .
