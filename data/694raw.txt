previously on prison break .
we're through the hard part .
another 18 inches , we'll hit that pipe .
we'll be there by friday .
now we got a hell of a lot to talk about , don't we?
this guy says he's on the job in here .
concrete is my specialty .
okay , boss , sign him up .
whites don't want you , blacks don't want you .
you're just caught in the middle , aren't you?
a regular 'tweener .
hello .
it's me .
it's time .
yes .
why are you so cynical?
michael , i think there's cynicism and then there's realism .
there's optimism , hope , faith .
thank you for trying to make me smile not today .
you never know .
you want the cooper story?
i can't give it to you , 'cause i'm not him .
the lawyers you tried to blow up , they're still running around .
same thing goes with the kid .
you got to hand the reins over to me , now .
first of all ...
ow !
you and your partner are off the job until further notice .
that one .
nice choice .
thanks .
platinum .
brushed .
six point two five?
six point two five .
she's a lucky woman .
yes .
she is .
you kept it .
kept what?
the flower .
i'm a pack rat , i never throw anything out .
yeah , all this clutter , it's , uh ... overwhelming .
you should see my apartment .
haven't even had our first date yet , and already you're inviting me in .
thought you were a nice girl .
oh , michael , we all know nice girls finish last .
so where do you finish?
that depends on where i start .
deep breath .
exhale .
inhale .
sara , we're backing up out here .
right .
i'm sorry .
i'm going to get your shot .
this is not what i signed on for .
what do you want us to do?
want us to wave the white flag?
call a time out?
i just want to get lincoln off death row .
lincoln?
we just learned that vice president reynolds funneled millions of dollars in research grants into her brother's company .
that money was filtered into millions of small accounts , that made millions of small donations to her campaign , setting her up to be the next leader of the free world .
this doesn't end with us stopping an execution anymore .
for me , it does .
okay .
let's rotate .
sergeant sodomy , you're up next .
yo .
come on .
i don't know about you all , but , uh ... this room is getting a little too dark for me to dig .
you telling me that there's a hole in fox river that you don't want to get into?
what?
hey , no one gets hurt .
you know , i got a question .
how come fusilli over here ain't grabbing a shovel?
i'm handling arrangements on the outside .
really?
so what is that transpo?
paper?
exactly .
that makes me management .
and that makes us just labor .
mm hmm .
now you're getting it .
you know , management better keep a close eye on the conditions up in here .
or the labor's liable to go on strike .
you feel me?
get back to work .
whoa , whoa .
co's coming .
put that back up there .
scofield .
move it .
it's time for your conjugal .
your wife is here .
so you're mrs. scofield .
you ever done this before?
had a conjugal , i mean .
no .
don't worry , i'm just trying to make conversation .
clear .
she look familiar to you?
mm .
no , captain .
i know her from somewhere .
you came .
of course .
how have you been?
fine .
i found a job .
good .
i'm glad .
is it awful being here?
remember the first place you stayed?
that hotel by the airport?
only difference is $69 and the free shampoo .
always the brave face .
you're still wearing it .
every day .
i worry about you .
don't .
is there anything else that i can do?
just what we agreed on .
i was so nervous when they were checking .
one question .
why would you need a credit card in prison?
see , i don't think the riot changed anything .
have you seen the latest budget cuts for this place?
another ten percent from health care .
35 % from prevention .
he might be the governor , but he's also your father .
maybe he thinks if he cuts enough they can't afford you .
you understand this is standard procedure following a conjugal , scofield?
never can be too careful .
all right , bend over .
you have a good time in the romper room with that euro?
whatever you say , boss .
she come around here before?
first time .
you sure?
'cause damn if i don't recognize her from somewhere .
maybe she visits some other con .
killing two birds with one bone .
catching my drift?
i wouldn't know .
all right .
he's clear , captain .
make sure you take a shower , scofield .
you never know what some women can give you .
swing low
sweet chariot
coming for to carry me home
swing low
you know this one , don't you?
sweet chariot
coming for to carry me home .
come on , give me something .
i thought you was the musical people .
you know , parents must be so proud of you , man .
i mean , hitting the trailer park trifecta .
racist ... pedophile , and stupid .
you know , it vexes me that ... that i'm made out to be the bad guy in the room .
it's not like y'all are incarcerated for stealing girl scout cookies .
none of us murdered any girl scouts in the process .
michael's coming back from the bone yard .
alone ... alone .
i tell you everything about me and maricruz , and you can't even tell me you're married?
later .
rough day , huh , scofield?
while the rest of us are in here slinging concrete , you got some little girl to play on your rusty trombone , huh?
the man's got a point .
just doesn't seem equitable like .
you know what i'm saying?
shut up and dig , t bag .
i think what the idiots inside here wants to know is ... while we're digging this hole ... what are you doing?
i'm going shopping .
we're good .
all clear .
a credit card?
the bulls catch you with that , they'll be so far up your doggy door , you'll ...
don't worry .
they won't be catching me with one .
how you so sure?
because ...
i don't have a credit card .
nick?
help !
please !
i had an accident ... my car ... is totaled .
i just need ... please ... is anyone in there?
we can't just ignore him .
the hell we can't .
please !
help me , please !
oh , god .
what happened?
uh ...
i must have dozed off .
i was driving for 12 hours .
should i get some water from the well?
the well's dried up .
oh , god , my leg .
i think there's a medical kit over here .
no one's going anywhere .
all right .
say good bye to junior .
no !
you know how many pints of blood the human body has?
the answer is ten .
ten pints .
how many do you think prince charming over there on the floor has left?
eight?
going on seven?
tell you what i'm gonna take him out to the woodshed , have a little talk .
in the meantime , i want you to chew on this .
you tell me everything that you have discovered about the burrows case , and who else you've told about it , and there's a chance that i might let you go in time to get mr. savrinn to a doctor .
you decide whose life is more valuable the guy waiting to die on death row or the guy wishing he'd die out in the woodshed .
one suit , black .
one pair of socks , black .
one pair of shoes .
shoelaces .
one small tape recorder .
one gold watch .
you ever stay at a fancy hotel , lj?
you know , you leave your room in the morning , it's a mess .
wet , dirty towels on the bathroom floor ,
last night's room service stinking to high heaven .
but then , when you come back at night , it's all gone .
fresh towels , clean sheets , candy on the pillow .
it's just the best feeling in the whole world ,
'cause someone else cleaned up your mess , all you had to do was walk away .
don't you hurt them .
okay .
but you got to tell me exactly what they know and who else they have told , and nobody has to die tonight .
you just walk away .
let me clean up your mess .
i don't know what's going on .
i swear to god !
i wish i could believe that .
bellick assigned me a new cell mate .
who'd you get?
some new fish .
ran a bump and swipe on an off duty cop .
fast hands , faster mouth .
yo , what's crackin ', my peoples?
speak of the devil .
michael scofield .
david apolskis .
what's up?
i seen you before , right?
you're part of that pi crew .
maybe you could hook me up .
you know , a brother needs to make some green some cash eesh , you know what i'm sayin '?
it pays 19 cents an hour .
19 cents?
that's slavery , yo .
that's prison , yo .
and besides , pl's all full up for now .
all right .
i feel you .
but keep a brother in mind , all right , if something opens up , you know?
hell , i'll pay 19 cents an hour to get me some more time out the block .
like having another kid .
already raised one , i'm too old to do it again .
you ever hear of anything being stolen from r and d?
of course .
bulls steal from personals all the time .
the problem is , you never know what's gone until you're on the outside of the walls .
at that point , you can't do anything about it .
what if you knew now?
look , i told you , leave me out of whatever it is you got going .
i just need to know if you've seen a guard with a gold watch .
there's a lot of people that can get you a gold watch in here .
yeah , but i need this specific gold watch .
westmoreland !
pope wants to see you !
let's go !
look , i haven't seen nothing .
but there is this one co word is , he's the worst thief in here .
my wife just faxed this over for you from county records .
copy of scofield's marriage license .
she says you owe her big time .
looks legit .
he wasn't trying to sneak in some whore for a conjugal .
says here , they got married the day before scofield robbed that bank .
why the hell would he do that?
heard from veronica?
no .
you?
just a note from lj saying he's with her , that he was safe .
but , you know , it's been awhile .
doesn't feel right .
feels wrong .
really wrong .
i , uh ...
i've come to a realization .
either miss donovan and that boy don't like you very much or they have an unreasonable amount of faith in your cardiovascular system .
so tell me , nick , this all you got?
this paper trail of an indictment that never even happened?
is this it?
we know you don't have a surveillance tape anymore .
we know you don't have anybody to testify .
so is this really all you've got?
mr. savrinn , that bullet went through your teres major , ripped the lateral margin of your scapula ,
leaving you absolutely no medial rotation of your arm .
so , if you try to swing that piece of lumber at me ... ... it's gonna feel like your arm is ripping out of its socket .
come on , nick .
mr. project justice .
we both know why you're really here , don't we?
and it ain't to save lincoln burrows 'life .
inside these walls , i creep and i crawl , looking for a way out .
but i know it's gonna be no easy route .
this is gonna be a 12 round ... 12 round bout .
with bellick and t bag on my mind ... ... it's grindin 'here ...
still interested in getting in on pl?
does my mama got big breastices?
i wouldn't know .
hell , yeah , she does , and hell , yeah , i do .
all right , look , i need a favor .
word is , you made your trade as a snatch and grab .
that's right .
i need you to steal something back that was stolen from me .
what kind of somethin 'we talkin 'about?
just a watch .
uh uh , there ain't no such thing as " just a watch .
every design has a different clasp , every clasp has a different swipe .
it's italian , a remedi .
gold band , pearl face , all weather .
what year?
2003 .
there's a butterfly clasp on that bitch .
which means what?
hidden deployment .
there ain't no way to snatch it without the mark feeling it which just means i'm gonna have to get whimsical on this ficky .
i get you this watch , that mean i get in on some of that pl?
it means i'll think about it no promises .
why you need this watch so bad anyway?
let's just say it means a lot to someone in my family .
come in , charles .
sit down .
what's going on?
i've got some bad news , charles .
your daughter is very sick .
she's got esophageal cancer .
now , she's at sacred heart in indianapolis .
and she wants to see you while there's still time .
how much time?
doctors say a few weeks .
the problem is , the d. o. c. is not gonna let you go .
they think you're still a flight risk .
she's my only child .
i know that .
believe me , charles , i've lobbied on your behalf .
it's state policy .
they will only extend furloughs in the case of funerals .
you're telling me
i have to wait until she dies before i see her?
mr. scofield , looks like i'll be administering your shot today .
where's dr. tancredi?
we've got a busy schedule today .
she's with another patient .
hold him down before he jumps off the cart !
hold his legs !
hold his legs down !
hey , we need a doctor here !
all right .
what's happened?
i don't know .
the kid was in chow .
then all of sudden , he collapsed , and he started spittin 'up his food .
looks like he's having some kind of a seizure .
get him up here , get him up here .
and make sure he doesn't hurt himself .
i gonna o2 and a cardio ...
hold him , hold him !
so , ms. donovan , how is that background in real estate law going for you?
it's a big help?
hmm?
you know , frankly , i think we caught a break .
lincoln had nailed a girl with half a brain , she probably would have brought this whole thing down already .
but you know what the worst part is?
that you dragged these people into this , knowing that you had no clue how to get them out .
i mean , if you had just minded your own business , people like leticia barris she wouldn't have a mouthful of maggots right about now .
your fianc would not be lying in his apartment waiting for the smell of his rotting corpse to let the neighbors know that something had gone horribly wrong .
that's right their deaths are on your head .
you made this mess .
nobody else .
you .
but you're also the one person that can end it all right here .
all i need to know is who else you've involved .
so , you just nod , and i'll know you're ready to talk .
you know , ms.
donovan , i think that , uh , you look a little cold .
maybe you'll find it easier to talk ... after you've warmed up a little bit .
where is he?
what happened?
we got to move .
come on , we don't have time .
come on !
come on , we're getting out of here .
where are the keys?
my pocket .
start the car !
okay .
is he gonna be all right?
go start the car , lj !
we're gonna get you to a hospital , all right?
a gift from my cell mate .
thank you .
and thank him .
the watch what's it for anyway?
thought you didn't want to know about any of this .
things have changed .
i want in .
why the sudden change of heart?
i have my reasons .
don't take this the wrong way , but everyone who's in is bringing something to the table .
how about money?
how much we talking about?
i think you know .
i seem to remember several conversations that ended with , " i am not d. b. cooper .
i lied .
you lied?
we're cons .
we tend to do that .
i checked your alibi .
according to records , you were incarcerated at the time of the cooper hijacking .
my father and i share more than just a weakness for easy money .
we also share a name .
charles westmoreland , senior was the one locked up that day .
now , do you want the money or not?
no offense , but it's a little convenient .
you want in , and suddenly , you're the guy .
how do i know you're not lying right now?
hey , old man river , keep it moving .
hey , sucre ...
i got a question about you and the rest of the mexicans .
i don't think i'll be able to help , seeing as i'm puerto rican .
geographical semantics , amigo .
i'm speaking about the general " latin o " population .
how is it that a people so historically
lazy ended up being such a big part of the nation's work force?
the way i see things , it's everyone else that's lazy .
otherwise , there wouldn't be any jobs for the immigrants .
the ones sitting at home collecting unemployment , the lazy ones it's not us .
you gonna let him talk about your people like that?
uh , whatever , deliverance .
you know what?
we may be a team in here , but just so that you know , the minute we get over that wall , it's every man for himself .
or sooner .
lj?
lj?
lj?
do you know how the russians do things?
they let you live , and they kill everyone else in your family , and , well , any anyone you've ever loved .
how does that sound?
go to hell .
oh , come on .
is that any way for a lady to talk?
oh .
what , do you think i'm an idiot?
i'm just going to walk into a well?
seriously , ms. donovan .
you all right?
scofield , no sitting down on the job .
i want you out here working where i can see you .
i'm on it , boss .
move it , scofield .
move it !
hey , brad .
good to see you .
hey , baby .
all right , ladies and gentlemen , put your hands together for our next lovely young lady .
up on the main stage , it's jasmine .
would you like a private dance?
why don't you sit down and chat for awhile .
see if we hit it off .
so , what's your name?
brad .
yours?
jasmine .
come on ... your real name .
it's nika .
nika .
now that's a pretty name .
tell me , nika , how's your husband feel about you working here?
i'm not married .
i hope you're lying for the sake of titillation .
otherwise , your little visit to fox river this morning would have been breaking the law ...
mrs. scofield .
we are married .
but they tell all the girls to lie .
it's better for making business .
i'm not here to get you in trouble .
i just want to know a little more about your husband .
well , he's a very good man .
i'm sure he is .
but even good men do bad things .
your accent .
you're from now , don't tell me budapest , right?
prague .
prague ...
how recently did you come over?
only a couple months , i bet .
you like it here in america?
you know , i really have to keep moving .
they don't like us to spend too much time in one spot .
now i don't want to have to check into your immigration status ...
i just need to know what michael scofield wanted from you in exchange for the green card .
nothing .
we met while he was studying overseas ...
i don't want to know what you memorized for the ins .
now , either you answer my questions about scofield , or i call my guy in the chicago p. d.
and maybe he starts asking some questions about you .
a credit card .
he asked me to bring him a credit card .
that's it .
yeah .
trace this call .
come and get me now .
new glarus , i'm in new glarus .
no , thanks , i brought my own .
dorothy andrews elston kabis .
united states treasurer , 1971 .
the year of the d. b. cooper hijacking .
dl192589 the first number in a series of bills used in the ransom drop .
thanks for the history lesson .
all it proves is you did the research .
same as me .
so , you're married .
uh , well ... not in the traditional sense of the word .
michael , we're both adults , put your cards on the table .
okay , i'll got first .
um ... as one of the very few women around here ,
i'm used to a certain amount of innuendo and flirtation being thrown my way .
i'm not used to enjoying it .
look , sara ...
it's " dr.
tancredi , " and please let me finish .
i'm not a jealous woman .
but i am a careful one .
and for some reason , when i'm around you , i'm not .
careful .
you don't have to be .
yes , i do .
there are so many questions surrounding you , michael .
there are way too many .
so here's the deal .
um ...
from now on , your shots , any medical concerns , they're all fine , as long as it's doctor patient .
but personal questions and favors of any kind , are no longer a part of our relationship .
the questions you have about me ... there are answers .
quinn !
i was getting worried .
you guys get lost?
we tried to call you again to pinpoint your signal , but you never picked up .
yeah , the battery went dead on the damn cell phone .
what are you going to do , right?
so , uh , how'd it go?
i have a broken leg down here .
yeah , listen , you know , i think maybe we got off on the wrong foot .
you have bosses , i have bosses . but at the end of the day , we're all on the same team .
right?
we're both just trying to tie up some loose ends .
i could not agree more .
yeah , so , can you guys get a rope or a ladder , or something?
what the hell is that?
hey ...
hey !
just tying up some loose ends .
you stupid son of ...
hey , guys !
hey !
hey , don't do this !
don't do this !
please !
my leg's broken , i can't stand !
you have to help me !
you can't just leave him down there .
he'll die .
he's the only one who knows we don't have the burrows kid .
the only one .
there's room for you down there too , danny .
don't leave me like this !
don't leave me !
please !
please !
you coming back to pi today?
it's getting kind of testy in there , you know?
yeah .
i just needed to find something out .
what the hell is that?
listen .
am i supposed to be hearing something?
shh .
just hold on .
there .
what?
we sat around here for 20 minutes waiting to hear that?
18 minutes , actually .
and , yes .
what was it?
keys .
the guards 'keys .
18 minutes is how long we have between each time the guards pass beneath the infirmary windows on their rounds at night .
cons aren't allowed outside after hours .
it was the only way i could find out the timing .
what does that mean?
it means ...
four days from now , on the night of the escape , we'll have 18 minutes to get the bars off the infirmary window , and for all seven of us to get across the wire and over the wall .
is that doable?
of course .
what's up?
nothing .
hey , i know that look .
what's up?
i hit it !
i hit it !
there it is , the pipe !
we're there !
guys , guys .
come on , michael , talk to me .
you want the good news or the bad?
the good .
westmoreland and his money are in .
what's the bad?
i've done the math .
it'll take at least 5 minutes for us to get the bars off the window in the infirmary .
and two minutes each for us to get across the wire and over the wall .
so?
we've only got 18 minutes .
we've got too many people .
one of them has to go .
raceman
