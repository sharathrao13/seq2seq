back in the 70s , every cop wanted out of the city .
but the only cops allowed to live outside new york were transit cops .
because the transit authority was also run by jersey and connecticut .
so these guys i knew at the 37 ... they started pulling overtime at subway stations , and got the city to declare them auxiliary transit cops .
they bought some land in jersey .
got some cheap loans from people they knew .
they made themselves a place where the shit couldnt touch em .
thats what they thought anyway .
every precinct has its cop bar, a private club , all blue , no civilians .
for the 37 , it was the 4 aces ... just across the river .
they hired this local hero to be their sheriff .
a wanna be who couldnt get on the force on account of his bad ear .
this armenian guy , hes from the other side over there .
he tells her that shes dead .
right?
shes gonna be dead by morning .
so he drops this box off at her place , right?
they call you guys .
they call bomb squad .
right .
we go in there .
we x ray it on scene .
and , uh , we cant see anything in there .
right .
so i cut a little hole in it .
i can see theres something in there .
uh huh .
i , uh , i see that theres , uh , some white fuzz .
theres something pink .
i cant figure out what it is .
suddenly i realize i am looking at a tongue .
ah , shit !
a big , fat tongue sticking out at me .
yes .
the guy put a goats head in there .
this at the end of the twentieth century .
h. g. wells , hed turn over in his grave to think at the start of a new millennium ...
armenian .
armenian guy .
some armenian would be deliverin a goats head to the door of the woman that he loved .

its your office .
that there is manny cardoza and his brother .
theyre drug runners .
hmph .
i didnt know they allowed classical music in jersey .
whos this?
toy torillo .
you heard of him?
oh , yes .
hmm .
i dont know how you do it , sheriff .
keeping all these hessians in line .
all blue .
everybody packing .
all together .
one door down from the next .
the wives borrowing the sugar .
its like youre the sheriff of copland .
hmm .
look at this .
hmm .
you see , sheriff , i got a sticky problem .
my jurisdiction ends , in a sense , at the george washington bridge .
but half the men i watch live beyond that bridge ... where no ones watching .
im watching .
i can see that .
youve got a crime rate here of about , what?
the lowest in northern new jersey .
you got hoboken and jersey city over here .
newark .
we try to do a good job with what we have .
with a staff of three?
no , sheriff .
what you got is a town that scares the shit out of certain people .
lieutenant , i told you , lm watching .
i mean , if you look around you see none of these people are wearing silk shirts .
their pools are above ground .
you know?
you raise your family somewhere decent , i guess thats a crime now .
lieutenant , look around .
this is a town with a population of 1, 000 people and maybe 30 families are cops .
thats it .
i got news for you .
not all cops are dirty .
im not saying they are .
sheriff , i went to the same academy as our friend out there .
who , ray?
yeah .
he was a beauty .
he was a real collar man .
but i dont know .
something happened to him along the way .
you mind if i sit down?
we buried a suit today .
we buried a suit today !
that doesnt bother you?
he jumped off the g. w. b. yeah , but his body never hit the water .
that doesnt bother you .
what does?
that i investigate cops?
being a man who always pined to be a cop?
i am a cop .
pined to be n. y. p. d.
three , four absences ... ten years .
appeals of hearing tests .
right?
you may be law enforcement , and so am i , but you are not a cop .
now , i may watch cops .
but tell me if lm wrong .
every day out these windows , so do you .
you watch cops too .
and since we are both law enforcement , we share a duty .
do we not?
if there is a stink , we must investigate .
we must gather evidence because evidence makes us see the truth .

you turn the wheel when you hit a red light .
you dont drive down broadway to get to broadway .
but how does this apply to what you were saying in there?

why didnt superboy go to new york to get some help?
i dont know .
hes got his aunt rosie here .

hes scared .
hes a fugitive , and hes convinced youre gonna kill him .
hes a mixed up kid .
so are you .
ray , theres gotta be a way out of this for everyone .
so , i say why dont we all go in tomorrow together .
freddy , i invited men , cops , good men , to live in this town .
and these men , to make a living , they cross that bridge every day ... to a place where everything is upside down .
where the cop is the perp , and the perp is the victim .
the only thing they did was to get their families out ... before it got to them .
we made a place where things make sense , and you can walk across the street without fear .
and you come to me with a plan to set things right .
everyone in this city holding hands , singing we are the world .
thats very nice .
but , freddy , your plan is the plan of a boy .
you made it on the back of a matchbook without thinking !
without looking at the cards .
i look at the cards .
i see this town ... destroyed .

i look at this town ... and i dont like what i see anymore .

hes like a scared animal .
hes scared to death .
that motherfucker should be scared .
his uncle got this case closed with one phone call .
look , lm sorry it took so long for me to come around , but you were right .
i couldnt see the truth .
like you said , the evidence , my loyalty , they were confusing .
they never give you any napkins in this place .
what am i supposed to use?

you came to me , to my town ... with all these speeches , talking to me about doing the right thing .
im doing the right thing .
