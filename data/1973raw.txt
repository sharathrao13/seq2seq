how about you?
do you remember your mother when y'all were living together?
no , not really .
i used to try to remember her .
anything about her .
like her voice , the way she smelled , you know , anything .
i used to think real hard ... wanting memories .
and i just started making them up .
that she was putting on her eye shadow and talking to me in the mirror ... or i'd pretend that ... she'd make me these perfect grilled cheeses with the crusts cut off .
i had all kinds of made up memories .
my favorite one was that she'd take me to see her shows ... and i would be sitting on the side with this nice man ... who'd give me all the shirley temples i wanted .
i made up so many memories ...
i actually started to believe i was really remembering her .
but she never came for me , so i just forgot .
you know ... stopped pretending .
ho , ho , ho !
is that a real tree?
lord , where did you get that?
it fell off the back of a truck .
like hell it did .
all right , maybe it was a volvo .
we should put it right up front where everybody could see .
sure .
lawson , where's the laundry?
shit .
i remember the day i graduated from protg to confidant .
he never meant to let me in on his secrets .
he thrived on his own mystery .
but once the first one was discovered ...
it wasn't long before there were none left between us .
i was on the back steps of the library ...
when i spotted his uniform , a freshly laundered shirt ...
the color of easter , and that damn hat .
he strode across campus with purpose .
everything about tommy said ready .
i'm tommy , just so you can follow .
sounds just like you .
he almost skipped right passed me . " 'nice hat , 'i said ...
eliciting tommy's notorious smile .
it was the same smile that he granted to each woman that caught his eye .
the smile that served as an answer to all undesirable questions .
or the smile for one of his children ...
whenever he found a tiny hand reaching for his .
that's nice ...
but i think that might be a bad sentence .
i think they all are .
that's why they're hanging from the goddamn christmas tree .
no , but it's just that , normally , it's just not on ...
tommy took the stairs , two at a time , bellowing , 'well , god damn ...
if it isn't the south's next great native son . '
i was only one of hundreds who came religiously twice a week ...
to be dazzled by the professor , each performance worthy of applause .
tommy , at the front of the hall , waving his arms wildly ...
as if mastering an imaginary lasso .
i like " lariat " better .
i think you ...
i like " lasso .
years ago , you trusted my opinion .
years ago , you were easier to trust .
thank y'all very much .
have a merry christmas .
nobody can do the alabama shuffle as good as bobby long ... but this sweet thing , she can move .
why can't you be this sweet all the time?
sure , and what would that get me?
pure , unadulterated joy .
you keep your lecherous eyes off our girl .
what?
she don't like me .
she likes lawson better than she likes me .
you like lawson better than me , don't you?
you're drunk .
you know what , i am .
i really am .
but it's all right , because lawson is gonna take us home .
not tonight .
i got him all to myself .
you told them about the news , honey?
we were just thinking that maybe after the holidays ... he could move in with me and get some more work done .
it's just something that we kicked around .
lawson is not in love with you .
bobby , i don't think that's any of your damn business .
i've seen him with a woman that he can't get enough of .
a woman that's crawled into every molecule of his being ... that consumed his every thought ... and turned him into a creation of devotion and obsession .
i have the scars of that love on my face .
have you told her about that?
have you told her about the difference between true love ... and a warm bed to pass the time away?
cool it .
don't go after her .
i never said i was going anywhere .
i only speak the truth .
the woman deserves to know the truth .
and you , you're free to do as you please .
am i , really?
finally free?
i want to say something on this occasion ... where we're celebrating our love and friendships with one another .
friend by enemy i call you out
you there , with a bad coin in your socket
you there , my friend with a winning air
who palmed the lie on me when you looked brassily at my shyest secret
with my whole heart under your hammer
that though i loved him for his faults
as much as for his good
my friend were an enemy on stilts
with his head in a cunning cloud
bravo , man .
now , why don't you come out and fucking say what you really mean?
just to be anybody but who you really are?
you want to tell me that you're disappointed in me?
'cause maybe i'm disappointed in you .
you know , i never asked to write your damn book .
your redemption and my penance , right?
haven't i paid?
nine fucking years .
i am sorry , all right?
i am so fucking sorry .
it's dylan thomas .
to others than you .
that's an easy one .
good night , bobby .
shit .
you okay?
can i come in?
you really did a number on yourself this time .
lawson's gonna leave me right by myself .
i always knew it .
i deserve it .
i'm gonna die alone .
he's not gonna leave you .
yes , he is .
no .
he'll always be there for you .
he cut up my story and hung it on the christmas tree .
honey , i peed myself .
all right , let's get you into bed .
come on .
oh , god .
it's so damn cold .
how is he?
i think he peed blood .
god damn it .
i knew he wasn't himself tonight .
he's afraid of doctors .
it's probably some bacterial thing .
it's nothing .
are you gonna move out?
no .
are you in love with her?
no .
she's really nice .
yeah , she is .
are you worried about him?
what happened , lawson?
when i met bobby , he seemed absolutely larger than life .
did whatever the hell he wanted ... but still he had the beautiful wife and kids .
students loved him .
faculty hated him .
women wanted him .
christ , he had me so convinced of my own grand destiny ...
i may have fallen a little in love myself .
we hung out all the time .
there was a woman who i wanted to marry .
her friend fell for bobby pretty hard .
he started spending more time with us than he was at home .
one night , their youngest had a little league game .
it was a double header .
so i convinced him to have drinks with the girls first .
said i'd go to the game with him later .
he kept on saying he had to leave .
somehow one drink became two , and then three .
and then ... this idiot , the dean's nephew ... came in and announced ... that he was sleeping with my girlfriend ... and everyone knew but me .
i went after him .
he took a swing .
bobby stepped in ... and he cracked bobby's face wide open .
bobby went crazy .
he beat up that kid pretty bad .
it'd just gotten so late .
i knew ben would be waiting .
but when we got there , he was gone .
everyone was .
he should never have been by himself .
he was just a little boy , and it was so dark .
there's too many people ... in such a damn hurry on that road .
there's no way a driver could have seen him .
i mean , he was so little .
and , god , he worshipped his dad .
juliette told bobby to leave and never come back .
she needed a better man .
that's how she put it .
so you came here?
seemed like a good place to write .
it was far away ...
good universities .
bobby could start over .
i thought i should be here with him .
i mean , if it wasn't for me that night ... things might have ...
i don't know what happened , really .
we read too many damn books .
there's something about this city .
that's all .
you should get some sleep .
i made you breakfast in mattress .
thank you , ma'am .
have we heard from the man yet?
no .
should we get him up first?
can you give me that shirt , please?
thank you .
nice hat .
get up , old man .
i hear we gotta take you to a doctor .
and get that off your pecker .
what do you care?
you're slicing it up , anyway .
it doesn't mean i want my book getting the clap .
i had the urge to read something likable about myself .
find anything?
not really .
i didn't mean to mess things up between you and georgianna .
i didn't mean what i said .
oh , christ .
last night was a blur .
i don't know what was said .
and i don't want to remember .
come on .
good , presents .
yay !
merry christmas !
it was our home that night , all of ours .
we both knew we should tell her the truth ... but every day felt like the wrong day .
and christmas is as good a day as any to believe in fairy tales .
that night reminded bobby and me of a time in our lives ... we 'd both chosen to forget until she arrived .
it felt good to remember ... if just for a little while .
i'm so full .
me , too .
me , too .
i wish it would snow .
me , too .
me , too .
but i love the rain .
me , too .
me , too .
come on , man .
you gotta piss sometime .
christ , i can't do it while you're watching me .
i've seen you piss a thousand times .
well , suddenly i am shy , okay?
piss right now .
christ , it's probably nothing , man .
i've lived long enough anyhow .
lord , it's cold .
it's clear .
i pissed clear .
like hell you did .
don't lie to me .
so it was a little pink .
i'm not going .
you got any short stories you haven't destroyed by fire or scissor?
my english final , i gotta write something ... and read it in front of the entire class , and there's no exceptions .
fuck !
so you're doing okay in english .
i'm doing okay reading english .
i'm not a writer .
what the hell are you wearing?
what do you care?
it's lorraine's .
you just let her stuff collect dust in there .
you'd rather freeze than wear your mama's clothes .
this robe and the person who wore it ... is worth more than a hundred people who don't appreciate them .
is something wrong?
you gonna tell her?
tell her what?
we gotta take bobby to the doctor .
he's still pissing blood .
he's been putting it off for weeks .
okay .
i hope you're not wearing them lady underwear .
i most certainly am .
they're good luck .
besides , they're gonna take them off anyway ... and put one of them backless numbers on me .
everybody's seen my peter .
that's right .
everyone just wants to see your peter .
and my ass .
let's go .
what did i tell you?
goddamn string draped over my ass .
where's bobby?
i made him that andouille gumbo shit he loves .
they needed him for some more tests .
is he all right?
they think so .
they just gotta look at his toe and make sure .
well , then , maybe you might wanna invite georgianna over for dinner .
i think she's working .
is there an occasion i don't know about?
i have a date .
really?
that's a first .
i figured it was about time i got a life .
great to hear it .
is that a new dress?
yeah .
well , sort of .
i mean , bobby's right .
there's no reason to let lorraine's clothes collect dust .
she was really tiny .
you should have seen me trying to zip it up .
just make sure it stays zipped up .
i'm a big girl , lawson .
i have been for quite some time now .
hey , is that an sat application?
yeah .
my guidance counselor gave it to me .
i meant to throw it out .
what?
if she thinks your grades are good enough for college , you go to college .
well , college costs money .
there's financial aid .
i might have to go away .
you might .
i have to go .
isn't he picking you up?
no .
i'm meeting him somewhere .
you can't walk home from the streetcar alone .
call me at ray and ruthie's and i'll ...
no , i'll get a ride .
besides , you should spend time alone with georgianna .
you haven't stayed over there since before christmas , right?
you said you wanted to see more of the new orleans music scene .
i figure this is a good place to start .
i know him .
really?
hey , sugar , what are you doing here?
my friend sean brought me .
sean , this is junior .
great to meet you .
i've seen you play around , man .
you are great , man .
really , really great .
how come i didn't know you were a badass sax player?
well , i don't play much anymore , you know .
i mean , i don't have ...
don't got the lungs for it .
how's bobby?
better than you sound .
you sitting in again , or what?
tiny , there's somebody i want you to meet .
this can't be that sweet baby girl , purslane .
you don't remember me , do you?
no , sorry .
when your mama used to play here ... she used to sit you right over there on that stool .
and you was so cute .
see , my job was to keep you full of shirley temples .
you remember that?
with junior .
you used to play with lorraine back then .
you were in the band , weren't you?
yeah , she and junior was our best night here , when they wasn't bickering .
little purslane .
look , you come back and see old tiny again , all right?
and the shirley temples on the house .
see you later , man .
you were really in lorraine's band?
of course i was .
i mean , everybody was at that time .
that's just how it was .
lorraine and me ... we were close at one time .
i remember the last time she wore that dress .
it looks just as pretty on you .
i gotta go .
glad you came , honey .
why didn't you tell me your mama was a singer?
that's so cool .
i don't know .
it was a long time ago .
you want a drink?
i'm ready .
jesus .
are you anxious to get home?
unless you and purslane don't want me around anymore .
you finally figured us out .
what's the verdict?
i got a kidney infection .
they gave me some medicine .
said i got to dry out .
what about the toe?
it's just a fungus .
got goop .
you're a lucky man .
you're gonna be all right .
of course i am .
but what if i wasn't?
what do you mean?
i saw you with purslane on christmas eve .
are you sleeping with her , lawson?
no .
how could you think that?
because she's becoming more fetching every day .
because she's a young woman .
she's got a crush , and we both know how nice that is .
she's a kid , bobby .
she's 18 .
my wife was 18 when i met her .
it was love at first sight .
nothing happened .
that night ... things had gotten a little out of hand ... and i think she was kind of frightened by it all .
she was feeling a bit lonely and cold .
well , my guess is that she wasn't the only one .
just remember , she's lorraine's daughter .
you're jealous .
absolutely .
shit , i ain't worth this much .
fuck , no .
winter never feels truly at home in new orleans .
an unwelcome visitor that shows up long enough ... to remind us of what we 're missing ... and leaves us just in time for us to forget again .
spring , and we're still here .
how about we grab a bottle of wine ... and go down to the river like we used to?
what do you think of that?
remember that very generous girl who used to skinny dip?
what was her name?
i don't know .
she's born again now .
think we'll still be living together in heaven?
byron , de sade , hemingway .
i'll be more fun than all of them whiners put together .
yes , i guess you would .
i really think pursey can get financial aid .
will you forget that?
she's gonna go off to some fancy school after we taught her everything she knows .
we'll still be sitting here getting older and uglier ... and any spring could be our last ...
god damn it , i wanna go to the river now .
why are you such a dramatic old bastard?
i just want to breathe in every day .
happiness makes up in height what it lacks in length .
robert frost .
come on .
you know damn well she'll miss us if she leaves .
if she leaves , she's gone .
final chapter .
end of story .
i want to go to the river now .
but i need peace and quiet .
i got so much to do ... to pull off this graduation .
i gotta write a short story , or poem , or something .
i can't think of anything .
i'm gonna blow the whole thing .
i know you .
you'll be fine .
i'll see you later .
hey , babe .
i've been waiting for you all day .
lee , what are you doing here?
how did you find me?
you smell nice .
aren't you gonna ask me in?
i drove all night .
and i got you this .
this place really looks like you .
all those lady magazines ...
i don't read those anymore .
i don't have the time .
what are you doing now?
you waitressing?
no , i'm ...
it's none of your business .
man , you must be doing okay .
no rent ... and this place definitely kicks ass over the trailer .
lee , what do you want?
what do you mean?
i just came up here to make sure that you're safe ...
once lorraine's fool friends get the boot .
what are you talking about?
those guys that you had to share this place with .
how do you know who i live with?
some lawyer sent you a letter .
which you , of course , opened .
their year is almost up ... and i've been trying really hard to better myself .
i've missed you so much ...
this letter says as of july 1 ...
i'm the sole owner of this house .
yeah , i know .
you didn't know that?
jesus christ , man !
those fucking scumbag losers lied ...
they are not losers .
they're my ...
they're your what?
you cannot call them losers .
you think that ...
i have a real life now .
i go to school ...
a real life?
yeah .
as opposed to the piece of shit life that we had?
and i guess you got some real men in your real life , too .
men who lie to girls so they can have a roof over their heads?
fuck you !
or what?
are they getting something else for their trouble?
they used you , purslane .
just like they used lorraine .
get out .
that's just fine !
i came all the way up here to see you !
you're in school now .
that's some funny stuff .
i want you to remember something , purslane .
a weed is just a weed ... no matter how pretty the flower .
that's just fucking brilliant , lee .
get out !
what the hell is going on?
she must be cleaning or something .
she locked the door .
pursey , open up , honey .
pursey , it's us .
pursey , honey , open up .
you locked the door .
god damn it , i told you this would happen .
no .
oh , god .
how?
let's go .
she needs some time .
two goddamn days and no one's seen her .
she asked for the weekend off .
the trail is exhausted .
ray said she came in early this morning .
used the phone .
she snuck past us?
probably on purpose .
you have not been very supportive in this ordeal .
you're staying with me , aren't you?
you're welcome to go elsewhere .
i can rectify this .
tomorrow she goes to school .
i'll set the alarm .
get up early .
talk to her on the way .
work this whole thing out .
we don't have an alarm .
sweetheart , we've been waiting for you .
what do you think?
it's all your favorite colors .
and guess who helped?
we had ray , and lke , and even earl .
it'll probably add value to the selling price , so thanks .
don't know why you have to go so soon .
we'll still be friends .
it's them i wanna get away from .
you know they didn't mean to hurt you ...
why don't you start off in the kitchen?
i'll finish this .
my sweet purslane ...
i am getting well and can 't wait to see you .
time seems to stand still in these places ...
but somehow too much of it has passed , and there 's so much to say .
i write to you always , but never have the courage to send my letters .
i want you to have them now to give you our history .
i 'd like you to know your daddy ...
and to know that only i 'm to blame for the fact that he doesn 't already know you .
i wrote this song for you both .
honey , where do you want me to put your glasses?
what's wrong?
how could you talk about her all the time and never tell me this?
is this true?
your singing touched my soul .
bobby long .
i always suspected , but she never told me .
i loved her first .
and bobby got here , and all hell broke loose .
bobby was still married .
he never even knew how she felt .
she worked so hard to get clean .
and when she did , she came home for a big show at the howlin 'wolf .
this show?
the date's right .
she said your grandma would bring you up .
you never did show .
he never did , either .
boy , she was devastated neither one of you was there .
to my sweet bobby .
i am feeling better and coming home to sing you a brand new song .
please come .
someone i love will be there and i want to introduce you .
this was you , darling .
you and bobby .
i just ...
i can't believe it .
why do you keep drinking that shit?
don't you know it's gonna kill you?
didn't you watch lorraine?
god , sometimes you make me so fucking sick .
you're living in some fantasy world ... where life's a book and no one takes responsibility for writing .
every idiot knows that books are better than life .
that's why they're books !
pursey , honey , you go right ahead and be wicked .
we deserve it .
but when you're finished , why don't we just all sit down and talk like a family?
like a family .
would that be like that family you destroyed?
are we just gonna be like that family?
'cause the weird thing is that , according to lorraine , i am your family .
couldn't you count to nine months?
i never understood why she would want me to live with y'all ...
but you're my father .
i just ...
did you love her?
did you love her?
yes , very much .
but i just ...
i wish we never knew .
no .
don't go , pursey .
don't walk away .
it's too late .
no , it's not too late .
you got me now , honey .
you're not alone anymore .
let me be here .
what can i do?
tell me .
what , honey?
remember when i told you i made up memories about her?
yes .
the really pathetic part was that i used to make up memories about myself .
like parents got lots of stories about their kids .
you know , like , " wasn't it cute when suzie couldn't say supercalifucking ...
whatever .
i mean , people remember a lot of weird shit .
like you probably got a ton of stories about your kids , right?
yes , i do .
well , i kind of felt that maybe ...
i used to do some cute or funny stuff when i was little .
but the truth is nobody was really there watching , were they?
honey , i was there .
sweetheart , i was there .
i saw .
it was never very long , but i was there .
will you tell me about her?
yes .
every tiny thing about her?
oh , yes .
and about me , too?
'cause i think i really need to know now .
yes .
i don't want to sell our house .
i love our house .
i just ...
i was so mad at you .
i'm so sorry .
i don't remember how to do this .
i'll do it for you .
shit , man .
your foot's blue .
i've been practicing wearing this shoe .
it's just numb , is all .
i don't want any reason for my daughter to be ashamed of her daddy .
now , how do i look?
damn good .
how do i look?
well , pretty good .
your hair's sticking up .
there you go .
good lord , y'all look like regular taxpayers .
maybe i ain't dressed appropriate .
you look fine .
your fly is down .
come on , we're gonna be late .
are you ready to see our daughter graduate?
yes , i am , sir .
it's a day to count our blessings .
yes .
quiet , everybody .
quiet down .
i'd like to propose a toast ... to my very beautiful daughter , purslane hominy ... who is my very own golden girl .
cecil mentioned earlier that today was a day we should count our blessings .
and as i look around , i see that there are many ... that i have not given credence to .
i am thankful for a god that i had thought had given up on me ... and the love of a child who , god willing ... will be in college this fall .
and not no vinegar bend junior college , neither .
my baby's smart .
smarter than her old man .
that's for goddamn sure .
pursey , honey , you have taught this old fool a thing or two .
we shall not cease exploration .
and at the end of all our exploring ...
will be to arrive where we started ...
and know the place for the first time .
and that's what you've given your old man .
and he is forever grateful .
now , come on up and give your old man an alabama shuffle .
play that slow one that i asked for .
some people reach a place in time where they 've gone as far as they can ... the place where wives and jobs collide with desire ... that which is unknowable , and those who remain out of sight .
see what is invisible , and you will see what to write .
that 's how bobby used to put it .
it was the invisible people he wanted to live with .
the ones that we walk past every day .
the ones we sometimes become .
the ones in books who live only in someone 's mind 's eye .
he was a man who was destined to go through life and not around it .
a man who was sure the shortest path to heaven was straight through hell .
but the truth of his handicap ...
lay only in a mind both exalted and crippled by too many stories ... and the path he chose to become one .
bobby long 's tragic flaw was his romance with all that he saw .
and i guess if people want to believe in some form of justice ... then bobby long got his for a song .
