oh , this is sixth sense .
i've never seen this .
bruce willis is dead .
what?
bruce willis , he's a ghost .
why would you tell me that?
i don't know .
makes me feel good .
thanks a lot .
oh , million dollar baby .
yeah .
you seen it?
no .
she dies .
what?
she breaks her neck and she dies .
you're a mean little dude .
gentlemen , i am proud to announce that my comrade and i have reclaimed the high score in hell hunters .
that's probably 'cause you're the only ones at the bar who still play that game .
so there we are , face to face with a brain thirsty mob of zombies .
it looks hopeless .
that's when i spot the zombie fuel truck .
but before i take aim
i blast it .
and it blows up .
it's like we're one mind with two bodies .
neither of which will ever get laid .
hey , thanks for that break , jason , i needed it .
seems like all i've been doing lately is working on russ thompson's campaign .
who's russ thompson?
he's the democrat running for manhattan borough president whose campaign i've been working on .
we're going to his fundraiser tomorrow night .
i'm pretty sure we've been through this .
this may shock you , but i don't listen to a lot of what you say .
i put a flyer on the bulletin board .
we have a bulletin board?
you guys have to come support russ thompson , all right?
we cannot let him lose to that republican douche bag jack clark .
look , i'm as big a democrat as the next guy who doesn't vote .
but ...
i can't go .
i gotta go do a recognize tomorrow night .
a " recognize "?
what are you talking about?
whenever my boss starts dating a new girl , he likes me to show up at the restaurant and pretend to recognize him .
makes the girl think he's still famous .
glad to see your econ major's paying off .
but , i mean , why are you still working for that lunatic?
because that lunatic is my ticket to rock immortality .
the guy made rolling stone's list of all time top record producers .
didn't his last album totally tank?
yeah , but what do you expect?
it was the bachman turner overdrive without bachman or turner .
okay , so no barry .
bobby , you're coming , right?
no , because i'm not a democrat .
what are you?
i'm an unregistered .
oh , please , you'll get hungry around 6 : 00 and beg me to come for the free food .
jason , i assume you're in .
um , actually , i have a prior obligation .
what is it?
it's a personal thing .
uh oh .
someone has a date with an ugly chick .
what?
aw , come on !
prior obligation .
personal thing .
what is it?
is she hairy?
i don't have a date with a hairy girl .
n n n no , of course you don't .
because she's ... hairless?
you guys , it's a personal thing .
and it's none of your business .
well , wait a minute .
i could put the hairy chick with no hair down as your plus one .
it's about time .
she'll be here any minute .
i'm sorry .
okay , do you want the standard routine or the " i'm from the nobel prize selection committee "?
now , just keep it simple .
okay , you stop me .
you beg me to take a photo .
i will generously allow it , demonstrating to my date that not only am i very famous , but magnanimous towards my fans .
quickly , here she comes .
oh !
whoo hoo hoo !
you look ravishing , kathy .
sherry .
very good .
waiter , a sherry for kathy .
oh !
what nick dresden , the big music producer !
oh , wow .
i don't want to embarrass you , but you are , like , a rock god .
hey , do you think that maybe i could just get a photo with you?
bugger off , you wanker !
so what'd you think of thompson?
i thought he had some really good ideas .
like , those chunks of melon wrapped in ham?
yeah , that's why i'm voting for him .
so i just ran into jason and his date .
and?
hairy or hairless?
actually , neither .
pretty good lookin '.
she does have a penis , though .
wait , what are you talkin 'about?
jason was having dinner with a dude .
so what?
so there .
and there .
and there .
whoa .
are they sharing a dessert?
creme brulee .
wow .
no wonder he didn't want to tell us where he was going tonight .
but wait , that doesn't mean that he's
look , i'm not saying that he's definitely
no , we don't have any concrete evidence that he's
yeah .
although ...
we've known all along !
i mean , think about it .
we saw the signs .
in eighth grade , when we all went to see jurassic park , who snuck in to sleepless in seattle?
he used to design clothes for his g. i. joes .
yeah .
so , it's official .
jason's gay .
what do we do now?
i think we have to tell him that we know .
i mean , why make him go on living a lie?
i agree .
let's make him feel really safe and comfortable .
i think i know how we can get him to open up .
we'll just tell him our stories .
what stories?
you know , the gay stuff everyone does when they're kids .
i think that's a great idea .
yeah , yeah .
you go first .
yeah , and then i'll go .
i'll go last .
'cause i'm sure mine will be the gayest .
okay , um
you guys remember when we went to camp middlewood in 1989?
and i used to get the prickly heat on my legs .
and i always wore that shorty robe?
yeah , your kimono .
so anyway , i'm coming back from the showers one time .
i'm in that robe .
and i got baby oil on my legs because of the prickly heat .
go on .
i i go into my cabin .
and , uh , there's my bunkmate , sheldon dratch .
now , dratch used to always do this joke where he put his hand on your chair just before you sat down , and then he'd poke you in the butt .
right , right , right , yeah .
so i go to sit down .
dratch puts his finger under me .
all i got on is the shorty robe and the baby oil , you know?
so , i mean , i sit down , and , well
bloop .
bloop?
bloop?
bloop .
so , uh , for how how long?
oh , just , like , a second .
like , a couple seconds .
you know , actually , now that i think about it , it was really just an accident .
i mean , it's not exactly a gay story
dude , you got dratched !
ha ha ha .
yeah , all right .
we'll see who's laughing when you guys tell me your stories , huh?
you guys don't have any stories , do you?
it's 11 : 00 .
where is he?
maybe mr. creme brulee invited him in for a casual gay encounter .
you wouldn't think it would take so long .
i mean , there's no foreplay , right?
not that i know .
i don't know !
shut up .
hey , guys .
hey , girl .
you're lookin 'fierce .
can i get you a glass of chardonnay?
then we can dish .
uh ...
i'm good .
uh , so ... how was your evening?
it was fine .
did you , uh , satisfy your obligation?
okay , what is going on with you guys?
all right , all right .
look , i'm just gonna come out and say it .
we think that you're hiding something from us .
and we know about the guy you had dinner with tonight .
how do you know about that?
were you following me?
no , no .
i just happened to be at the restaurant and i happened to see you two .
and he happened to take some pictures .
who i have dinner with is none of your business .
look , jase .
whatever it is , we're cool with it .
all right , you don't have to keep who you are a secret from us .
we're your friends .
no matter what .
all right .
i guess i knew i'd have to tell you guys someday .
i kept it hidden for so long .
my parents don't even know .
hey , it's cool .
it's cool , okay?
you just let it out .
all right?
just let that right out .
okay .
okay .
i'm ...
i'm ... a republican .
hoo !
wow .
what a relief !
just to get it out there .
that's your secret?
yep .
wow .
a gay republican .
what?
i'm not gay .
why would you think that?
well , you spend more on shampoo than i do on food .
and then tonight i catch you having a romantic dinner with a dude .
it wasn't romantic .
he runs jack clark's campaign for borough president .
i'm working with him .
you're a republican?
since when?
i suspected back in middle school .
but it wasn't till the '96 election that i knew for sure .
you were so in love with clinton .
but i just wasn't feeling it .
at night i'd lock my door and download bob dole's platform .
okay , i just threw up in my mouth a little right there .
man , it's not that big a deal .
we'll just avoid talking about politics when jason's in the room .
yeah , just like we avoid talking about spiders when bobby's in the room .
dude , stop it !
right now !
i'm sorry , you can't expect me to just accept this .
you're right , i don't .
that's why i never told you .
so it's better to lie to me all these years?
who are you?
don't you think you're blowing this a little out of proportion?
it's just politics .
it's not just politics .
it's about core beliefs .
and now , i'm finding out we stand for completely different things .
like what?
like i care about compassion .
and taking care of people .
oh , and protecting the environment .
i'm for all those things .
i just don't think a bloated government is the way to get to them .
listen to you !
bloated government "?
and this is why i don't vote .
so what are you saying?
that if i'm a republican , we can't be friends?
i don't know .
maybe .
oh , come on , ben .
after everything we've been through together , you're gonna let this one little thing get between us?
it's not a little thing to me .
so .
barry's got a funny camp story .
so you still mad at jason?
i'm not mad at jason .
i'm mad at the selfish , hateful republican ideology that fills his cold , dead heart .
what are you doing?
sending out campaign materials for russ thompson .
hello .
hello .
may i sit?
free country .
no thanks to you .
stuffing envelopes?
yes .
you too?
yeah .
trying to get a thousand letters out by tomorrow .
i'm gonna get a thousand out today .
are you?
uh huh .
good luck to you .
and to you .
ow !
ooh , paper cut?
no .
ow !
cut your tongue?
no .
guys !
guys , what's the big deal?
what's the big deal?
look , if he had his way , the rich wouldn't pay taxes and alaska would become one giant gas station .
that is such a crock .
you can't even argue your point without resorting to hyperbole .
ooh , big word from someone who wants to eliminate the department of education .
stop it !
if this is the way it's gonna be around here ...
i may just have to get a job !
you know , nick , there are times i wish
i'd never responded to your ad in the village voice .
there are times i wish i'd never responded to certain ads in the village voice myself .
barry?
who's that?
it's a friend of mine .
do i have to remind you that this is a place of business?
bobby , what are you doing here?
we got a real problem at home .
jason and ben are at each other's throats .
barry?
is your friend here to ask my advice?
yes , nick .
my friend is here to ask your advice .
allow him to enter .
and welcome to oz .
so ... flatmates having a bit of a row?
they are .
your majesty .
let me tell you a little story , boys .
led zeppelin .
1975 .
it was the opening night of their physical graffiti tour in manchester .
robert plant was angry at jimmy page for hiding his show scarves yet again .
they both refused to play .
but luckily , i remembered they loved deep sea fishing .
so i hired them a boat .
put them on it .
and let them catch a marlin .
by showtime , they were right as rain .
so the point you're making is that by getting them together to do something they loved , it reminded them of what their friendship is really about .
no .
the point i'm trying to make is , i know jimmy page and robert plant .
so here's the deal .
you guys need to make up .
and one time led zeppelin caught this fish .
so we think you should play this game together .
as sound as your argument is , buddy , our issues run pretty deep .
and i don't think playing a video game is gonna help .
just humor us , okay?
all right , let's get this over with .
fine .
there's one over there .
got it .
no , heads up , 3 o'clock .
yeah , check .
oh , whoa , whoa .
here they come .
go , go , go , go .
nice shot !
good eyes .
it's like they're having make up sex .
see?
guns aren't always bad .
yeah , when you're using them to shoot zombies .
or defending your home against an intruder .
or when you accidentally shoot your mailman .
hey , hey , hey .
eyes on the prize .
these zombies aren't gonna kill themselves .
they're also not gonna wait two weeks while i get a gun permit .
okay !
you know what?
game over , all right?
this isn't gonna work .
thanks for trying .
that's one thing we can agree on .
excuse me , i'm so
barry?
yeah .
it's me !
sheldon dratch from camp !
sheldon freakin 'dratch !
you have no idea how happy we are to see you .
hey , yes !
ben , jason , bobby .
wow !
this is so great .
gosh !
barry , what's it been?
15 years since i've seen you , huh?
you have not changed a bit .
bloop !
but right , you know what?
let's all take a seat .
we'll catch up .
come on , barry , you sit next to me .
old times .
boom .
w w wait , you gotta show me how that works one more time , sheldon .
sure , sure .
you see , the natural oils in my finger bloop dissipate the foam .
so you just pop your finger right up in there?
yep .
right up in there .
okay , guys , we've taken up enough of sheldon's time .
i'm sure he's someplace to be .
not really .
we don't see a ring on this finger , huh?
just hit the road , jackass .
same old barry .
all right , well , i guess it's getting late .
i better scoot .
but listen , i just wanna say how great it is that the four of you have stayed so close for so long .
real quick , what's your secret?
well , we get along really well .
we have a lot of history .
i don't know .
what do you guys think?
i don't know .
we're ... kind of the brothers we never had .
yeah .
we know each other better than anyone else .
and we just i guess we just try not to let stuff get between us ... usually .
yeah .
yeah .
usually .
well , you're a lucky bunch of guys .
i hope you realize that .
seriously , get out .
all right , i'm out .
boom , boom , boom .
great guys .
all right .
so , you wanna go splatter some zombie brains , you fascist?
i could do that .
commie .
isn't it weird?
sheldon dratch just happened to show up here?
not really .
i looked him up in the phonebook and invited him .
