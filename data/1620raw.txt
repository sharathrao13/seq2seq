lazarus .
lazarus .
adonai .
god , help me .
we came here to pray .
look at this .
the money changers?
it's for the temple tax , for the feast .
i know .
i know .
how's the exchange today?
fair .
at this stall it's always fair .
making a good profit?
fair .
this is my father's house !
it is a place of worship ... ... not a market !
nazarene , what are you doing?
what are you doing?
god doesn't need a palace .
he doesn't need cypress trees or dead animals !
he doesn't need shekels !
you expect people to pay the tax with roman coins .
they have images of false gods on them !
you want pagan gods in the temple?
all foreign coins have to be exchanged for shekels .
that is the law .
i'm throwing away the law .
i have a new law and a new hope .
what?
has god changed his mind about the old law?
no .
he just thinks our hearts are ready to hold more , that's all .
this chaos is your new law?
how can you presume
how can i presume?
i'm the end of the old law and the beginning of the new one .
watch what you're saying .
maybe we should go .
when i say , " i , " rabbi ... ... i'm saying " god .
that's blasphemy .
didn't they tell you?
i'm the saint of blasphemy .
don't make any mistakes .
i didn't come here to bring peace .
i came to bring a sword .
talking like that will get you killed .
me killed?
listen to me .
this temple will be destroyed in three days .
torn down to the ground !
there won't be one stone left to build with !
you think god belongs only to you?
he doesn't .
god's an immortal spirit who belongs to everybody
to the whole world !
you think you're special !
god is not ...
magician , heal me .
cure us .
make us rich .
heal me !
do a miracle .
you want me to enter the world of god crippled like this?
don't touch me !
you're filled with hate !
get away !
god won't help you .
you cure us , or you won't leave this city alive .
you don't make demands on god !
judas !
what are you doing with this magician?
you had orders to kill him and you haven't done it .
now he acts like a prophet and you follow him .
did you hear what he said back there , saul?
yes , i heard him .
we took an oath against rome .
i don't see anything against rome here .
all i see are jews against jews .
then you're not listening .
lazarus .
how do you feel?
i like the light .
what was it like?
which is better , death or life?
i was a little surprised .
there wasn't that much difference .
give me your hand .
i'm not surprised .
how could they let lazarus live?
he was proof of your greatest miracle .
now there's no more proof .
that's what the zealots want .
their revolution , not yours .
you want to go back to them?
no .
you're the one i follow .
you are the strongest , aren't you?
of all my friends ... ... you're the strongest .
judas , my brother ... ... i've something to tell you .
i have a terrible secret from god .
you know why i came to jerusalem?
yes .
this is where the revolution is going to begin .
last night isaiah came to me .
he had a prophecy .
i saw it written .
he has borne our faults ... ... he was wounded for our transgressions ... ... yet he opened not his mouth .
despised and rejected by all ... ... he went forward without resisting , like a lamb led to the slaughter .
i don't understand .
judas , i am the lamb .
i'm the one who's going to die .
die?
you mean you're not the messiah?
i am .
that can't be .
if you're the messiah , why do you have to die?
listen .
at first , i didn't understand  no , you , listen !
every day you have a different plan !
first it's love , then it's the axe , and now you have to die .
what good could that do?
i can't help it .
god only talks to me a little at a time .
he tells me as much as i need to know .
we need you alive !
now i finally understand .
all my life i've been followed ... ... by voices ... ... by footsteps ... ... by shadows .
and do you know what the shadow is?
the cross .
i have to die on the cross and i have to die willingly .
we have to go back to the temple .
after you die on the cross , what happens then?
i come back to judge the living and the dead .
i don't believe you .
you have to .
i'm worried he's going to change his mind again .
no , he won't .
this time we're not going to the temple to pray .
he said he'll destroy the temple in three days , and he'll do it .
and what if he doesn't?
what then?
what if he doesn't?
you won't have to worry because we'll all be dead .
we're setting up a new government , building a new jerusalem .
we can ask for anything we want .
first , i'd like more sheep .
you know , my other sheep , i don't even know where they are now .
this time i want a large herd , and i'll get other shepherds to care for them .
i would just like to be able to worship in the temple .
i mean really worship , without roman banners and soldiers .
that's what i'd like .
of course .
but what else?
i'll do anything the master asks , anything but get crucified .
you're a coward , thomas .
yes , i am .
you know why?
have you ever seen anyone on a cross after two days?
you know what they look like?
they don't even have eyes .
the crows come and suck out your eyes .
and after that , you know what?
dogs come and rip your feet off .
don't talk that way .
i've made my decision .
you make yours .
and if you can't , then get out now before we get to jerusalem .
i'm ready .
i have my knife .
master , i've been talking with the others and listening and ....
will there be angels there to meet us?
or anyone besides who's here?
master .
king of the jews !
king of the jews !
king of the jews !
jesus !
lord , i hope this is what you want .
let me die here .
please let it happen fast while i have the strength .
i am here to set fire to the world .
in the desert , the baptist warned us , god is coming .
well , i'm telling you it's too late .
he's already here .
i'm here .
i'm going to baptize everybody with fire !
he's leading us !
follow him !
they're all with you , waiting for your signal .
give it !
now !
do it now !
please !
i'm waiting , too .
give me an axe , not the cross .
let me die like this .
give the sign now or we're finished .
they'll kill us  we came to fight , not to die !
master , we knew it would be like this .
this is the way .
do it .
judas , help me !
stay with me .
don't leave me .
i wish there was another way .
i'm sorry , but there isn't .
i have to die on the cross .
i won't let you die .
you have no choice , neither do i.
remember , we're bringing god and man together .
they'll never be together unless i die .
i'm the sacrifice .
without you , there can be no redemption .
forget everything else .
understand that .
no , i can't .
get somebody stronger .
you promised me .
remember , you once told me ... ... that if i moved one step from revolution , you'd kill me .
remember?
yes .
i've strayed , haven't i?
yes .
then you must keep your promise .
you have to kill me .
if that's what god wants , let god do it .
i won't .
he will do it through you .
the temple guards will be looking for me where there aren't any crowds .
we'll go to gethsemane .
you'll make sure that they find me there .
i am going to die .
but after three days ... ... i'll come back , in victory .
you can't leave me .
you have to give me strength .
if you were me , could you betray your master?
no .
that's why god gave me the easier job ... ... to be crucified .
what about the others?
i'll tell them tonight .
listen to me .
take this bread .
share it together .
this bread is my body .
now drink this wine .
pass the cup .
this wine is my blood .
do this to remember me .
we're not finished .
let him go .
all of you ... ... i want to tell you something .
wait for me here .
father in heaven .
father on earth .
the world ... ... that you've created , that we can see , is beautiful .
but the world you've created , that we can't see , is beautiful , too .
i don't know .
i'm sorry , father .
i don't know which is more beautiful .
this is my body , too .
together ... ... we're going to die .
please , father .
i've been with you for so long .
i never asked you to choose me .
i always did as you said .
you made many miracles for others .
you opened the red sea for moses .
you saved noah .
you took elijah to heaven in a fiery chariot ... ... and now you're asking me to be crucified .
can i ask you ... ... one last time?
do i have to die?
is there any other way?
you're offering me a cup , but i don't want to drink what's in it .
please , take it away .
please , stop .
please , father .
father .
please .
is this your answer?
all right .
just please give me the strength .
couldn't you stay awake with me for just an hour?
i'm sorry .
it doesn't matter .
it's too late .
welcome , rabbi .
no .
you live by this , you die by it .
take me with you .
i'm ready .
so , you are the king of the jews?
king " is your word .
well , you are jesus of nazareth , aren't you?
yes , i am .
that's what they're saying you are .
the king , the messiah .
it's also said that you do miracles .
is this good magic or bad magic?
could we have some kind of a demonstration?
i mean , can you do a trick for me , now?
no , i'm not a trained animal .
i'm not a magician .
that's disappointing .
this means that you're just another jewish politician .
do you want to know something?
you're more dangerous than the zealots .
do you know that?
say something .
you had better say something .
all right .
tell me what you tell people on the streets .
yes?
yes .
a tall statue that had a gold head and silver shoulders .
the stomach was bronze , the legs were iron , the feet were clay .
a stone was thrown .
the clay feet broke and the statue collapsed .
you see , god threw the stone .
the stone is me .
and rome
and rome is the statue , yes .
so your kingdom , or your world , will replace rome .
where is it?
my kingdom?
it's not here .
not on earth .
it wouldn't be , would it?
it's one thing to want to change the way that people live ... ... but you want to change how they think , how they feel .
all i'm saying is that change will happen with love , not with killing .
either way , it's dangerous .
it's against rome .
it's against the way the world is .
and killing or loving , it's all the same .
it simply doesn't matter how you want to change things .
we don't want them changed .
you do understand what has to happen?
we have a space for you up on golgotha .
three thousand skulls there by now .
probably more .
guard .
i do wish you people would go out and count them some time .
maybe you'd learn a lesson .
probably not .
i know you .
i saw you with him .
you must be mistaken .
it wasn't me .
it must have been someone else .
no , i'm right .
he is one of his followers .
he doesn't know what he's talking about .
he is one of his followers .
it's him !
get him !
mother?
magdalene?
where are you?
mother , lm sorry for being a bad son .
father , stay with me .
don't leave me .
father , forgive them .
father !
why have you forsaken me?
who are you?
i'm the angel who guards you .
your father is the god of mercy , not punishment .
he saw you and said , " aren't you his guardian angel?
well , go down and save him .
he's suffered enough .
remember when he told abraham to sacrifice his son?
abraham was just about to kill the boy with his knife when god stopped him .
so , if he saved abraham's son , don't you think he'd want to save his own?
he's tested you and he's happy with you .
he doesn't want your blood .
he said , " let him die in a dream .
but let him live his life .
all the pain .
that was real .
yes , but there won't be any more .
you've done enough .
i don't have to be sacrificed?
no , you don't .
i'm not the messiah?
no , you're not .
what about the others?
don't look back there .
god gave you life .
look ahead .
where are the disciples?
they became frightened and ran away .
ls this the world of god?
the one i spoke about?
no , this is earth .
why has it changed so much?
it hasn't changed .
you have .
now you can see its real beauty .
harmony between earth and the heart , that's the world of god .
maybe you'll find this hard to believe ... ... but sometimes we angels look down on men and envy you .
really envy you .
what's that?
a wedding ceremony .
who's getting married?
you are .
what's wrong?
why are you crying?
i'm thanking god ... ... for bringing you here .
we could have a child .
we could have a child .
where are you going?
who are you going to kill?
are you going to kill god?
didn't you hear me , jesus?
there is nothing you can do .
god's killed her .
god's killed her .
god took her away when she was happy .
now she's immortal .
she won't see her love die or body decay .
i was there the whole time he was killing her and saw what happened .
but it wasn't right .
it wasn't right for god to take her .
you didn't complain when god let you live .
you can't complain now because he let her die .
trust god's way .
listen .
there's only one woman in the world .
one woman with many faces .
this one falls , the next one rises .
mary magdalene died ... ... but mary , lazarus's sister ... ... she lives .
she's magdalene with a different face .
she's carrying your greatest joy inside her .
your son .
come with me .
this is the way the savior comes .
gradually , from embrace to embrace .
from son to son .
this is the road .
i understand .
mary .
look .
rabbi , i just want to see if it's really you .
he's real , like us .
don't you see?
come in .
come here .
master , i want to tell you one thing .
i'm sorry about magdalene .
i won't ever leave you alone again .
i'll always protect you .
i don't want you to take the wrong road and get lost again .
come inside .
i'll cook for you and your friend .
are you satisfied with me?
do you have any complaints?
none .
i'm ashamed when i think of it .
of what?
of all the mistakes i've made .
of all the wrong ways i looked for god .
where's mary?
she won't be back till this evening .
come inside .
it's too hot out here .
come inside .
there's only one woman in the world .
go inside .
we don't have to get involved .
come on , stay out of it .
here , watch your brother .
remember to thank god for the food and leave some for me .
i'll be back soon .
aren't you going to eat?
i want to hear what he says .
you don't have to go there .
i lied , i stole , i cheated ... ... i gambled , i whored , i drank and persecuted , tortured and murdered .
yes , murdered !
i killed anyone who broke the law of moses .
and i loved it , i enjoyed it , i relished it , i reveled in it .
because i thought i was doing god's will .
i thought i was doing god's will .
and the high priest of jerusalem sent me to damascus to scourge that city .
and on the road to damascus , just outside the city , in the middle of the day ... ... i was struck by a white light that blinded me !
yes .
saul , why are you persecuting me?
why are you against me?
who are you? " i said .
jesus .
and he ... ... made me see .
i was led helpless like a child , into a city that i was sent to scourge .
and god sent me ananias instead ... ... and he put his hands on me and i opened my eyes ... ... and i was baptized and became paul .
and now i bring the good news to you .
it's about jesus of nazareth .
he was not the son of mary .
he was the son of god .
his mother was a virgin .
and the angel gabriel came down and put god's seed in her womb .
that's how he was born .
and he was punished for our sins .
then he was tortured and crucified .
but three days later he rose up from the dead ... ... and went up to heaven .
death was conquered !
amen .
do you understand what that means?
he conquered death .
all of our sins were forgiven ... ... and now the world of god is open to every one of us .
to everybody !
did you ever see this jesus of nazareth after he came back from the dead?
i mean , with your own eyes?
no , but i saw a light that blinded me and i heard his voice .
you're a liar .
his disciples saw him .
they were hiding in an attic , the doors locked , and he appeared to them .
liar .
he's a liar !
wait a minute .
wait a minute , i want to talk to you .
i was never crucified .
i never came back from the dead .
i'm a man .
quiet !
why are you telling these lies?
what are you talking about?
i'm the son of mary and joseph .
i'm the one who preached in galilee .
i had followers , we marched on jerusalem .
pilate condemned me and god saved me .
no , he didn't .
who are you talking about?
don't try to tell me what happened , because i know .
i live like a man now .
i work , eat , have children .
i enjoy my life .
for the first time , i'm enjoying it .
do you understand me?
so don't go around telling lies about me , or i'll tell everybody the truth !
wait just a minute .
what's the matter with you?
look around you .
look at all these people .
look at their faces .
do you see how unhappy they are?
do you see how they're suffering?
their only hope is the resurrected jesus .
i don't care whether you're jesus or not .
the resurrected jesus will save the world and that's what matters .
those are lies .
you can't save the world by lying .
i created the truth out of what people needed and what they believed .
if i have to crucify you to save the world , then i'll crucify you .
and if i have to resurrect you , then i'll do that , too .
i won't let you .
i'll tell everyone the truth .
go ahead .
go on .
tell them now .
who's going to believe you?
you started all this , now you can't stop it .
all those people who believe me will kill you .
no .
that wouldn't happen .
how do you know?
you see , you don't know how much people need god .
you don't know how happy he can make them .
happy to do anything .
he can make them happy to die and they'll die .
all for the sake of christ .
jesus christ .
jesus of nazareth .
the son of god .
the messiah .
not you .
not for your sake .
you know , i'm glad i met you .
because now i can forget all about you .
my jesus is much more important and much more powerful .
thank you .
it's a good thing i met you .
don't ever leave me .
i'm happy here .
i remember when mary and i planted these vines .
you know , this will all pass .
why?
are you leaving me?
we have to move on .
you've grown old .
you've done well .
we've both done well .
get inside .
get inside , fast !
jerusalem is on fire !
it's burning !
the romans are killing everyone .
move out of the way .
we were sent here .
god told us you would show yourself to us .
he said you were dying .
peter? ls that you?
i can't tell .
what happened to you?
i got old .
you got old .
this one i know .
no matter how old you get , i know you , nathaniel .
you were the best shepherd because you had no sheep .
rabbi .
i missed you .
and you?
they cut you .
your face .
who are you?
john .
the romans tortured me , cut my face .
i tried to tell them all about you .
then i saw jerusalem burn .
i even saw the ark of the covenant stolen from the temple .
they destroyed the temple , just like you said .
the ark?
there's someone else outside .
be careful .
he's still angry .
judas .
judas , come in .
didn't you hear me?
i missed you so much .
he hears you .
he just won't say anything .
he's been fighting in jerusalem .
look at his hands .
there's still blood on them .
judas , the master is speaking to you .
answer him .
traitor !
your place was on the cross .
that's where god put you .
when death got too close , you got scared and you ran away ... ... and you hid yourself in the life of some man .
we did what we were supposed to do !
you didn't !
you're a coward !
don't you have any respect?
for him?
you don't understand .
understand?
you broke my heart .
sometimes i curse the day i ever met you .
we held the world in our hands .
remember what you told me?
you took me in your arms .
do you remember?
and you begged me , " betray me , betray me .
i have to be crucified .
i have to be resurrected so i can save the world .
i am the lamb , " you said .
death is the door .
judas , my brother , don't be afraid .
help me go through the door .
and i loved you so much .
i went and betrayed you .
and you ...
... you ....
what are you doing here?
what business do you have here with women , with children?
what's good for man isn't good for god .
why weren't you crucified?
look at his wounds , judas .
they're bleeding .
you're hurting him .
that's enough .
he was going to be the new covenant .
now there's no more israel .
no , you don't understand .
the guardian angel .
god sent a guardian angel to save me .
what angel?
look at her .
satan .
i told you we would meet again .
if you die this way , you die like a man .
you turned against god , your father .
there's no sacrifice .
there's no salvation .
there's nothing you can do .
you lived this life .
you accepted it .
it's over now .
you just finish it and die .
die like a man .
father .
will you listen to me?
are you still there?
will you listen to a selfish , unfaithful son?
i fought you when you called .
i resisted .
i thought i knew more .
i didn't want to be your son .
can you forgive me?
i didn't fight hard enough .
father ... ... give me your hand .
i want to bring salvation !
father , take me back !
make a feast !
welcome me home !
i want to be your son !
i want to pay the price !
i want to be crucified and rise again !
i want to be the messiah !
it is accomplished !
it is accomplished .
