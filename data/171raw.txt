every day when one's body and mind are at peace ,
one should meditate upon being ripped apart
by arrows , rifles , spears and swords ,
being carried away by surging waves ,
being thrown into the midst of a great fire ,
being struck by lightning ,
being shaken to death by a great earthquake ,
falling from thousand foot cliffs , dying of disease
or committing seppuku at the death of one's master .
i'll get you the rest tomorrow .
no problem .
'listen , frank ...
'don't fuck around with the boss's daughter . '
'don't break my balls , uncle joe . '
'asshole , listen to me .
'she's been in and out of psychiatric hospitals .
'she's a wacko . ''yeah , yeah ... '
'vargo has put the family money in her trust fund . '
'i already know . ''you'll get clipped . '
are you finished yet , uncle joe?
'you'll get whacked ! '
i'm not fu ...
i'm not fucking dead yet , so let's get off the goddamn phone .
'are you listening?
that girl's a fucking wacko . '
'yeah , i know . ''vargo's crazy about her .
'you know what " crazy " means? '
'yeah , i know , uncle joe . '

yeah .
it's going down tonight .
i'm using my special guy .
what about the girl?
morini put her on the bus ... to the seashore .
good .
i don't feel good about it .
handsome frank's a made guy and all .
a good soldier .
i feel a little bad .
forget about it .
handsome frank fucked up .
pay your respects at the funeral .
yeah ...
'home in ! '
'one , two , three , four , five , six , seven . '
have some more wine , louise .
i don't want any more wine .
what the fuck?
what do you want?
my rolex?
whatever ...
did my father send you here to do this?
it's a good book .
ancient japan was a pretty strange place .
you can have it .
i'm finished with it .
i've got a bad feeling , vin .
first valerio calls me in for a sit down with vargo himself .
and now the bird .
here , birdy birdy .
come here , you little fucker .
goddammit , this is ridiculous .
i can't write this small .
can't we swag a fax machine and get it to this guy?
it ain't the middle ages .
come here , birdy .
i got him , louie !
louie , i got him .
i got the sucker .
little fucker , here we go .
easy now , mr chicken , easy .
mother of jesus , vin , hold it still !
i don't want to hurt him .
ready?
yeah , ok .
go home , little birdy , go home .
'shit !
shit ! '
'what's going on?
what's the problem here? '
you little brat !
you want us to come up there?
fuck you !
then you gonna get it !
you little prick !
eat me !
cocksucker .
hey , louie .
what the fuck are you guys doing?
his mother went to work and locked him in .
he's mad as hell .
vargo's waiting for us .
you've got bigger problems than this .
johnny , you said the girl was on the fucking bus last night .
what happened?
she was .
i don't know what happened .
let's go .
come on , vin , let's go .
ghost dog !
knowledge to knowledge , baby .
shit !
how you doin '?
how are you?
they're inside , waiting for you .
condolences on handsome frank .
thank you .
my thoughts are with you , joe .
they're waiting for you .
i'm sorry about frank .
thank you .
sorry about your nephew , kid .
they whacked him .
what are you gonna do?
that's the way it goes .
hey .
go in , they're waiting .
thanks .
louie , how's it going?
i'm sorry we're late , mr vargo .
mr bonacelli was ... delayed on his way over .
sit down .
johnny , step outside , have a smoke .
sure , sonny .
mr vargo .
we got a big problem here .
seems like you're responsible .
your mystery man fucked up .
morini told me he put the girl ... ..
mr vargo's daughter , on the bus .
he did ... but she got off and went to handsome frank's house .
you wanted handsome frank whacked ...
so he got whacked .
from outside .
i set it all up .
no traces , no nothing .
morini said that she was on the bus .
jesus , it's lucky he didn't do her , too .
right?
if he had , you would be fucking dead .
this is not a good situation .
where is she?
is she ok?
don't worry about mr vargo's daughter .
we need to eliminate the scumbag who whacked frank .
frank was one of us .
his killer needs to be ... neutralised .
erased from the planet .
for the past four years , he's done maybe 12 perfect contracts .
perfect .
like a ghost .
he's valuable .
totally untraceable .
if he'd realised anyone would be there , he'd have backed off .
he sure didn't know that she was gonna ... be there .
louie , unless you wanna be buried next to frank , tell us everything about this mysterious , ghostlike , untraceable fuckin 'button man .
ok , ok .
er , let's see ...
i don't pay him by the job .
he'll only work if i pay once a year on the first day of autumn .
first day of autumn , i settle up for that past year , see?
the first day of autumn ...
ok , ok .
let's skip that part .
where does he live?
fucked if i know .
that's the next strange thing .
i can't call him .
he contacts me only through a bird .
since i first started contracting stuff out to him , the bird comes every single day .
hold it , hold it , hold it .
did you say he contacts you through a fucking bird?
did i just hear that?
what particular species ... of bird?
it's a pigeon .
it must be a carrier pigeon or whatever .
passenger pigeon !
they've been extinct since 1914 !
am i fucking dreaming here or what?
ok , louie , forget about the bird .
let me ask you this .
tell me , what does this mysterious guy look like?
he's a big guy .
a big black guy .
he's what?
he said the guy's a nigger !
maybe eight years ago , i saw a guy , this guy .
'he was a kid in a bad situation . '
stupid ass motherfucker !
get his ass up here !
you motherfucker !
what's the problem here?
'so i ... straightened things out . '
anyway , about four years ago , this big guy comes to my door .
this black guy , got a fucking pigeon on his shoulder .
fuck knows how he found me , but he said he owed me .
i only saw him once after that and we made this arrangement .
that's very touching , louie .
let me just backtrack for a second .
the bird comes to your house every day .
did he come today?
yes , the bird was there this morning .
did he have a message?
the usual " mission accomplished " message .
uh huh .
and did you send a message back?
no .
you'd called me in , so i figured it was best to leave it alone .
did you follow this bird?
put a bug on it?
anything like that?
no , i never had a reason to do anything like that .
i realise the arrangement i made with this guy is pretty weird , but he's always shown me complete respect .
a whole new century is coming , and mr vargo wants every member of this family to make it a priority to erase this weirdo .
this guy is a professional .
going after him could be dangerous .
handsome frank was one of us , so we're gonna peel this nigger's cap back .
better him than you , right?
now , what the fuck is his name?
ghost dog .
what?
ghost dog .
ghost dog?
he said ghost dog !
he calls himself ghost dog .
a lot of these black guys , gangster type guys , they all got names like that .
is that true?
he means like the rappers .
the rappers got names like that snoop doggy dogg ,
ice cube , q tip , method man .
my favourite was always flavor flav from public enemy .
he got the funky fresh fly flava .
live lyrics from the bank of reality .
i kick da flyest dope manoeuvre technicality , to a dope track .
i love that guy .
i know nothing about that , but it makes me think about indians .
they've got names like red cloud , crazy horse ,
running bear , black elk ...
that kind of shit .
indians , niggers ... same thing !
johnny !
sonny?
mr vargo?
go outside .
get sammy the snake , joe rags , big angie .
get 'em in here .
right away .
yes !
hey !
peace , dog !
is that your dog?
no .
i thought maybe it was your dog .
what?
what?
he's really staring at you .
maybe he wants my ice cream .
i don't think so .
if he's bothering you , why not tell him to go away?
go on .
i've seen you before ...
'cause you always carry that briefcase .
you live on the roof of the building down from me , where the birds fly out from .
mom says you talk to nobody and you got no friends .
i don't know your mom .
is it true?
what?
you never talk to nobody and you got no friends .
no , i'm talking to you , right?
yeah .
right .
you got your lunch in that box?
what you got in the briefcase?
i asked you first .
no .
not my lunch .
i got my books .
you wanna see?

yeah , ok .

i read that .

yeah .
toad hall and that stuff .
it was great .
you did read it .

i read that , too .
where did you get that?
from ms andrews , my teacher .
i didn't read all of it , but i plan to .
you got time .
night nurse "? !
you read that?
no , i just like the cover .
right ...
frankenstein " .
that's a good book .
yeah , better than the movie .
you thought so , too?
yeah .
can i see it?
yeah .
he sprung from the cabin window
upon the ice raft , which lay close to the vessel .
he was soon borne away by the waves ,
and lost in darkness ... and distance .
hey , that's the end !
don't give away the ending .
the monster ...
frankenstein .
rashomon " .
what's this about?
pearline?
you can borrow that .
you just gotta promise that when you read it , you come tell me what you think .
ok , i will .
is it true you got no friends , then?
no .
my best friend's right over there .
you wanna meet my best friend?
i don't see anybody .
he's there in that ice cream truck .
what do you think , i'm a chump?
i'm not going there .
i hardly know you .
whatever .
well , all right .
pearline , where are you going?
i'm going to get ice cream .
i'm coming right back .

raymond , this is ...
pearline , right?
yeah .
my best friend .
well , ok .
thanks .
chocolate's my favourite .
yeah .

he only speaks french .

no .
i never understand a word he says .
and that's your best friend?
yeah .

yes !
bravo !

ok .
ok .

that fucking thing loaded?
yeah , ok .
come on , let's do it .

that could be him right there .
should i shoot him?
no , that ain't him .
vargo said it was a black guy .
so , what's he?
what are you , puerto rican?
i think he's an indian .
what the hell are you?
cayuga .
cayuga?
what the fuck is cayuga?
puerto rican , indian , nigger ... same thing .
we should waste him to be sure .
it ain't authorised , so let's go .
i wanna get the right guy .
stupid fucking white man .
what?
i said stupid fucking white man .
you red nigger looking sitting bullshit motherfucker !
sam , you're losing control .
let's get out of here .
cayuga , my ass !
you better learn to keep your fucking mouth shut , or i'll blow your fucking brains out myself .
you dumb fuck !
hey , what the heck is going on , fellas?
what?
what?
ah , shit !
i don't think that's him .
how the hell do you know?
it doesn't feel right .
now he's got his own wings , he can fly with his pigeons .
vargo said , if he even looks like him , shoot him , right?
i know .
let's go .
i gotta take care of something for sonny .
fuck .
i knew that was gonna be you .
you gonna kill me?
you might as well kill me .
i'm your retainer .
i follow a code .
i've always given you my respect .
that's why you've got that big fucking gun to my head?
forgive me .
i don't mean you no disrespect .
how the fuck did you find me?
called me for a meeting .
yeah .
everything seems to be changing all around us .
you can say that again .
when you did that guy the other night , was a girl there?
i wasn't instructed to eliminate her .
i know , it's just that ... things have gotten all complicated now .
they're gonna whack you , ghost dog .
if they don't find you , they're gonna whack me instead .
probably whack me anyways .
ray vargo?
the whole family's looking for you .
the underboss , valerio , too?
of course .
he pulls all the ...
hey ...
how the fuck do you know so much about our organisation?
who was the girl?
she's ...
forget about her , i can't talk about that .
i'm warning you that they're gonna kill you .
maybe me , too .
better me than you , louie .
well ...
right now , i'd have to agree with that .
hey , louie !
sorry i'm late ... and i'm real sorry about this .
jesus christ !
you just shot morini .
valerio's fucking brother in law !
he was gonna shoot you .
what?

i don't think he's getting any older .
roll him over .
now you really better shoot me .
there's no way i'm gonna explain this .
fuckin 'morini !
ok , shoot me .
go ahead , kill me now .
i'm your retainer .

if you're my retainer , whatever that is , then do what i tell you !

you told me to .
i don't mean you no disrespect .
now you've got an excuse .
tell them i attacked you both .
you better watch your back , ghost dog !
