richard , i am fed up with your stupid jokes .
it wasn't me this time .
i swear .
richard , we do not have time ...
christ !
i'm teiling you the truth , your fucking assholes !
frank , would you say something for once?
i think we'd better get out of here .
get going .
we should have passed a town or a gas station or ... a motel , or a crossroads , a junction , something by now !
i know .
i know .
just calm down , laura .
it's probably one of those closed roads that forest rangers use .
god !
i just feei iike we've been driving forever .
what is this forest?
is this iike the amazon?
last year , i had to drive to lakewood to talk with a client and i went ... ... on a very roundabout way .
what you seem to do sometimes .
i was driving and driving untii i had to turn back to the road i came from .
what are you talking about?
some of these roads are designed ... by engineers who weren't qualified to build a goddamn bird house !
so?
so?
that's that !
that's that ...
lakewood?
isn't there where saily schmidt bought her cottage?
yeah , i think so .
jesus christ !
what was that?
some kind of a radio talk show .
that was no talk show .
a public radio , or something .
public radio?
right .
no !
damn it !
you just said it was public radio !
i don't know what it was !
i don't wanna know what it was !
i just wanna get to the police before anything else goes wrong .
and i thought iast year's christmas was bad .
and what was wrong with iast year's christmas?
let's see ...
everything?
i thought iast year was great !
we took the interstate !
i was talking about christmas dinner .
and what's wrong with my family's christmas dinners?
your family .
your mother always felt you deserved more than a used car salesman .
now that salesman has become a respected sales manager .
so , i'm sorry , baby , but screw your mother !
anything else?
your damn brother is a freak too !
he jerks off to gun magazines !
that is disgusting !
that is disgusting and that is not fair !
mikey has had a iot of hard times !

you are so beautiful , marion .
jesus !
let's hope there's a hospitai in marcott .
what if we never reach marcott?
what if she gets us first?
who?
the iady in white .
that woman with the baby?
yeah , i saw her in the woods ... ... right after richard disappeared .
you saw her?
and then i remembered the story my grandfather used to teii me .
used to creep me out every time i heard it .
look .
i made a drawing of brad .
this was his ieg that was hanging out .
it's for you .
okay , mom .
wipe your face .
there was this couple that was driving home from a wedding ... in rhode island .
it was night .
it was raining .
and they saw a iittle giri standing by the side of the road .
and she was just wandering back and forth , clutching the schooi book .
they stopped and they iet her get into the back seat ... and they tried to talk to her , but she must have been in shock .
they were driving on down the road , aii of a sudden they heard a scream ... coming from the back seat .
they slammed on the brakes , they nearly had an accident .
miraculously , they didn't go over the cliff .
they turned to the back seat ... the iittle giri had vanished .
there was just her schooi book there , with her name on it .
barbara rose .
and then they remembered : the entire rose family had died in a tragic car accident ... right at that cliff , five years earlier .
come on !
dad , what are you saying?
that that woman is a ghost?
look !
we've got potato chips !
i'ii get them open .
i didn't know we had them .
do you want some?
mom , don't eat them so fast .
you're gonna make yourself sick .
i am not .
oh , god !
we'd better wake up from this nightmare pretty soon .
do you feei better , laura?
dad , who's alan rickson?
i have no idea .
what was mom talking about?
i never heard of any alan rickson .
she's in shock .
she's talking a whole iot of nonsense .
why would she do that?
you teii me .
wow !
look what i found !
mom , put the gun down .
it's dangerous .
it's not .
it's a toy !
it's iike the one michaei used to have .
laura !
i was just kidding !
laura , that is a ioaded gun .
put it down .
you are just trying to scare me .
i don't wanna play with you anymore .
bang bang , you are dead !
okay .
okay , sweetheart .
you win .
i'm dead .
do something .
like what?
you are the shrink .
student shrink .
marion ...
mom !
yes , darling .
we'ii play something else now .
remember when we used to play house?
i don't wanna play that .
i wanna play what michaei and i used to .
laura , this is not a game !
our son is dead !
no .
richard is dead !
dad !
holy shit !
the bitch shot me in the ieg !
is he hurt?
mom , go back to the car .
it's gonna be aii right .
is he gonna die too?
nobody is gonna die anymore , okay?
how does it iook , doc?
we'ii see .
hold this .
hold this !
aii right .
i have to get the peilets out .
okay .
light on the wound , please .
have you done this before?
no , this is my first time .
shit !
light on the wound !
right .
okay , brace yourself .
why?
brace yourself .
oh , god !
that hurt more than the shot !
okay , iift your ieg up .
aii right .
aii right .
you should be aii right now .
give me the keys .
i'ii drive .
easy on the bottle there .
you know of a better pain kiiler?
driving isn't helping any .
it helps .
i don't understand it .
we should have passed a side road by now .
your grandma's place is probably miles behind us .
that's it !
this must be a military road !
you think so?
that's why we never see military trucks .
always on roads isolated !
marcott must be a military base .
that's why it's not even on the map .
i guess so .
of course !
that's it !
that's it !
dad?
dad !
it's okay , honey .
i'm here .
i'm here .
thank god !
i thought that ...
your ieg ...
are you okay?
that's not so bad .
i think we finaily got some good news .
come here .
look .
earlier , i showed your mother the north star .
it was on our right side .
it stiii is .
that means we've been headed constantly west .
so , if we ieft the interstate somewhere around here ... and we headed constantly west on this road ... the road must go right straight to the sea .
marcott must be somewhere on the coast .
it makes perfect sense .
it must be a navai base .
okay , okay .
so how iong untii we get there?
we have about half a tank of gas , we covered 1 50 miles on this road .
that ieaves us another 40 or 50 miles untii we get to the coast .
we can reach marcott within an hour , tops .
you're a genius .
but you know , i'm more than a iittle concerned about your mother .
mom?
you're awake?
i slept iike a iog .
how are you feeling?
i feel ... okay ... considering ...
now we have got ... to stick together .
we have got to support each other in our grief .
would you iike me to drive , darling?
we should reach marcott soon .
oh , good !
you iook not very weil .
she's okay .
frank , you know , you are a wonderfui father .
and a wonderfui husband too .
i want you to know that i understand about you and saily schmidt .
what?
i know the whole thing .
i know how you two used to meet at the motei 6 on your iunch break .
it's okay .
i completely understand .
i have never been able to fulfiil ... your sexuai fantasies .
and i want to promise you ... that when we get out of here , you can do anything you want to me , darling .
and i mean anything .
anyway , the most important thing ... is that the three of us come out of this stronger .
what do you think?
not much .
good .
now ... there's something that has been bothering me ever since i woke up .
what?
who are these people in the woods?
honey , slow down .
they are waving .
hi !
oh , my goodness , why do they iook so sad?
this is christmas eve .
smile !
they teach you what to do in this kind of situation?
not to panic .
frank , do you reaily need to suck on that bottle iike that?
frank !
it's jeannine !
quick , stop the car !
who is jeannine?
she's my friend !
who died 20 years ago .

alan rickson was a friend of mine , back in detroit .
you don't have to say anything , dad .
then one day he came to me for some advice .
he said that he was in love with a woman .
didn't mention her name .
he said that she was married and that she loved him too .
and he wanted to know what he should do about it .
and i remember what i said to him ...
you only iive once , buddy .
go for it .
just go .
you go and you see her , and if she ioves you ... she wiii ieave her husband and she wiii go with you .
i'm sorry , dad .
only talked to him once after that .
he said the woman had decided she didn't want to ieave her husband .
she already had a kid .
a iittle girl .
she didn't want to iose her .
last time i ever saw alan .
always wondered why he never kept in touch .
why did you do that?
if you are scared , alcohoi wiii only make it worse .
you think i'm scared?
you don't need to pretend .
it's okay .
no , it's not .
have you iooked at the odometer iately?
we've driven 60 miles since the iast time we checked the map .
i know .
we should have reached the coast .
i know .
maybe i miscalculated a iittle bit .
maybe .
maybe the north star doesn't indicate north .
maybe the map maker was drunk .
maybe the moon's made out of cheese .
who knows?
everything is so fucked up on this goddamn road !
after ail , we don't have to drive to get to marcott .
maybe there's another way out .
