please check the latest gattaca bulletin .
jerome .
is this the approach path we discussed?
absolutely , director .
quite right .
listen to what i'm saying to you , i want what i ordered .
it's a completely different colour .
no .
i'm bored of talking to you .
i'm bored .
i'll call you back .
that was the company that sell us your hair dye .
they've sent me 'summer wheat 'instead of 'honey dawn '.
any full tone is two shades light .
'why don't you try a change? '
i don't want to change !
we can't use a change !
now i'll probably gonna have to pay for the 5 boxes they've sent me .
we can't stay here .
the idiots i have to deal with , you wouldn't believe !
they think i killed the mission director .
what makes them think that?
they found my eyelash .
where?
in the corridor .
well , that could be worse .
they could have found it in your eye .
they've got my picture posted up all over the place .
i can't turn around without seeing my own face .
they'll recognize me .
they won't recognize you .
they will recognize me !
i don't recognize you .
they won't marry the eyelash to you , they won't believe that one of their elite could've suckered them all this time .
no , no , no , we change nothing we do as we planned .
you're jerome morrow , navigator 1st class .
i'm not jerome morrow .
i'm a murder suspect .
what are you doing?
that's more than a day's worth !
wait .
we can't stay here .
stop that !
oh fine , fine !
you leave if you want .
but you're not taking that stuff .
that stuff is mine !
i could've rented myself somebody with a spine
if i'd known you'd go belly up on me at the last fuckin 'gasp .
you can't quit on me now .
i've put too much into this .
what do you want me to do?
wheel in there and finish the job myself?
eugene , they are going to find me .
you still don't understand , do you?
when they look at you , they don't see you any more .
they only see me .
keep your lashes on your lids where they belong .
how could you be so careless?
i'm going out .
where are you going?
well if i'm gonna get arrested tomorrow , i'm gonna go out tonight .
are you sure that's a good idea to go out?
that was your idea not to change anything .
who's going?
i'd say everybody .
if i don't go that will look suspicious .
you don't want to look suspicious , do you?
thanks .
who ordered this?
what are we doing here?
i'm following a lead .
forgive me , sir but that's what i do .
i'm a detective .
i follow leads .
why makes you think the owner of the eyelash is here?
he's an in valid , sir .
where do we look for in valids
but where in valids are .
he's an in valid .
he's an in valid clever enough to go unregistered all these years .
do you think he's likely to lie down for us now?
what do you suggest , sir?
move the inquiry back to the scene .
draw 5 miles radius around gattaca , sweep again .
random stops .
you're a navigator?
at gattaca?
that's what it says , doesn't it?
it doesn't say you're crippled .
i'm not crippled .
i hurt my leg training , you moron .
how dare you question me?
what's your number?
forget it .
no , what's your number , you fucking flatfoot !
i said forget it .
what do you want?
an apology?
it gets to you , doesn't it .
it gets to you that i can do what you can only dream of .
i'm getting off this ball of dirt !
how dare you question me !
that's harassment .
my mistake .
what's your number?
what's your number?
may i remind you that this is a crime scene .
what's this man doing here?
what are you doing , old man?
doing my job , sir .
this is evidence .
but it's just trash .
you didn't know?
oh yes , yeah .
wonderful , wasn't it?
12 fingers or 1 , it's how you play .
that piece can only be played with 12 .
what's all this about?
it's probably nothing .
no , you better not .
i don't want to give you a contaminated specimen .
get my meaning?
thanks .
you never know where those swabs have been .
i want to show you something .
come on , we'll miss it .
come on .
we'll miss it .
what did i tell you?
strange .
your eyes look different .
i guess it must be the light .
must be .
positive match .
i'm impressed .
the cup was definitely used since the original sweep?
two samples , two days .
either the suspect went back to the scene of the crime to get a drink of water and i don't know anybody that thirsty .
or he still works there .
i thought we checked all the service staff .
i don't think he cleans up the place any more .
i have a feeling he might be there on a false pretense , playing somebody else's hair .
a borrowed ladder at gattaca?
that's far fetched , but is not out of a possibility .
i find it hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers .
even if he got past their security system , he wouldn't have the mental faculty or the physical stamina .
maybe you're underestimating .
maybe he is an imposter and maybe the director found out about it .
that could be his motive .
i say we sample every employee within the parameters intravenously .
2/ 3 of their workforce fall in that category .
we'd be closing them down for days .
no , a fingertip sample or a urine should be sufficient .
i suggest blood from the vein .
i hope i'm not out of line .
it's only a matter of time , sir .
only a matter of time .
what's with the plungers , lamar?
you're openin'up a blood bank?
only the gentlemen from the law enforcement are concerned that my testing methods have been compromised .
goddamn !
i'm sorry .
are you out of practice , lamar?
let me look at that .
it's all right .
luckily , it looks as though we have enough .
well if you need any more , you can always get it off his shoes .
irene .
so you didn't do it after all?
no , i guess somebody beat me to it .
i guess .
i leave in two days .
i guess you know that .
but . . .
that's the last .
something's not right .
he's not here .
it's a blind out .
no , we miss something .
i say we test again .
test?
i cannot allow you to disrupt our operations any further .
you're not at all concerned about having a murderer in your midst?
right now , your presence is creating more of a threat .
the window for our latest launch is open for seven days once every 70 years .
so it's rather crucial we leave on time .
mission means a great deal to you , doesn't it?
and your late colleague opposed it .
didn't he?
take another look at my profile , detective .
you won't find a violent bone in my body .
my apologies , director .
he won't trouble you any further .
this is not the only place we can look .
okay .
let's start making the rounds .
i'm luckier than most .
not as lucky as some .
i know something about that .
you , jerome?
what heart problem did you ever have?
did you get yours broken once?
i had this crazy idea that you were more interested in the murder case than me .
you're right .
that's a crazy idea .
would you like to dance?
it's funny .
you work so hard , you do everything you can to get away from a place . . .
and when you finally get your chance to leave , you find a reason to stay .
a year is a long time .
not so long .
just once around the sun .
hello , everyone , nice to see you , i'm your detective for the evening .
please don't leave the premises .
i said nobody leave !
am i speaking in some kinda strange foreign language?
check the hands , lenses , dentures , napkins , i want cigarette butts , the saliva off tea cups .
that's a familiar face .
check him out .
i thought you wanted to dance .
where are you going?
oh yeah let me just ...
jerome !
are you insane?
come on !
where did they go?
where did they go?
come on .
don't you understand , i can't do that !
shh , you just did .
don't touch your face .
don't swallow .
don't spit .
let's clean his teeth .
vincent !
vincent !
who's vincent?
i. . .
don't say anything .
don't say anything .
what happened?
the scars on your legs?
you remember the '99 chrysler lebaron?
this is the exact height of the front fender .
looked left instead of right .
did you just make that up or do you use all the time?
i use it all the time .
i know you had something to do with the director's death .
that's not true , irene .
isn't that the man from last night?
he's nobody .
he's one of our best .
i'm certain he has nothing to do with this business .
jerome morrow .
you don't look well , jerome .
why don't you go home?
can i help you?
i'm looking for jerome morrow .
i'm sorry , he's ill .
a little nausea .
it's quite common before a mission .
i oughta pay him a visit .
i understand you can show me the way?
you don't know who he is , do you , irene?
hello?
eugene , i need you to be yourself for the day .
i was never very good at it , remember?
the investigators are coming by .
i'm supposed to be sick .
so you keep telling me?
how long have i got?
not long .
i guess he's not home .
i'm here to see jerome morrow .
yes that's me .
come up .
i guess he's home .
come in .
come in .
come in .
hello , sweetheart .
where is my kiss?
good to see you're feeling better .
of course , now that you're here .
who's your friend?
how can i help?
it's about the director .
again?
i hope it's no trouble .
no , no , no trouble .
forgive me for not giving your guided tour .
can't we do this another time?
this won't take a moment .
maybe he can tell me what i have got .
who were you expecting?
yes?
we have our man , sir .
you have him?
we have him in custody .
i'll come right away .
how are you , jerome?
not bad , jerome .
how the hell did you get up here?
i can always walk .
i've been faking it .
irene . . .
don't touch me !
listen to me , irene !
i don't even know who you are .
i'm the same person i was yesterday .
i can't hear anymore of your lies , jerome .
my name is vincent , vincent anton freeman .
and i'm a faith birth or a de gene erate or whatever you wanna call it .
but i'm not a murderer .
you're a god child?
well we do have one thing in common .
only i don't have 20 30 years left in mine .
mine is already 10, 000 beats overdue .
it's not possible .
you are the authority on what is not possible ,
aren't you , irene?
they've got you looking so hard for any flaw , that after a while that's all that you see .
for whatever it's worth , i'm here to tell you that it is possible .
it is possible .
congratulations , sir .
we did it .
his spit was found in the dead director's eye .
an unaccounted specimen .
while i was busy obsessing about an eyelash , your instincts took us in the right direction .
so the in valid had nothing to do with this?
no , our friend here acted alone .
this mission meant everything to him , didn't it?
he knows that if they miss this launch window he wouldn't live to see the next one .
and since nothing can stop the launch now , he's being very , very cooperative .
so , i imagin you'll be celebrating tonight , sir?
of course .
i think she likes us .
yeah , sure , just give her a little time and she'll get used to the idea .
what was he like?
who , the cop?
yeah .
he was just a cop .
did you catch his name?
actually my name was the topic of conversation .
yeah well , he'll be back .
you heard what he said , they have their man .
it's over .
no , it's not over .
i have to meet him .
vincent?
my god , you have changed .
has it been so long , you don't recognize your own brother?
are we brothers?
our parents both died thinking they'd outlived ya .
i had my doubts .
what are you doing here , anton?
i should ask you that question .
i have a right to be here .
you don't .
you almost sound as if you believe that .
i committed no murder .
you must be disappointed .
you committed fraud .
listen , you're in a lot of trouble , vincent .
i can get you out of here .
do you have any idea what it took to get in here?
you've gone as far as you can go .
you come with me now !
there's still a few million miles left to go .
it's over .
is that the only way you can succeed , is to see me fail?
i'm telling you ...
god !
even you are going to tell me what i can and can't do now?
in case you haven't noticed , i don't need any rescuing .
but you did , once .
you've got all the answers , how do you explain that?
you didn't beat me that day .
i beat myself .
who are you trying to convince?
do you want me to prove it to you?
it's not important , anton .
it's forgotten .
i'll prove it to you .
do you want me to prove it to you?
i'll prove it to you !
i do .
vincent !
vincent !
where's the shore?
we're too far out !
do you wannna quit?
we're too far out !
do you wanna quit?
no .
vincent !
how are you doing this , vincent?
how have you done any of this?
we have to go back .
no .
it's too late for that .
we're close to the other side .
what other side?
do you want to drown us both?
you want to know how i did it?
this is how i did it , anton .
i never saved anything for the swim back .
you couldn't see , could you?
that night , crossing the street .
you crossed anyway .
if you're still interested , let me know .
sorry . . .
the wind caught it .
you're flying today , aren't you?
look at what a mess you're in .
come on , i have your samples ready .
i don't need any samples where i'm going .
you might when you get back .
everything you need to last you two lifetimes .
why have you done all this?
so jerome will always be here when you need him .
where are you going?
i'm travelling , too .
i don't know how to thank you .
no , no . . .
i got the better end of the deal .
i only lent you my body .
you lent me your dream .
until you're upstairs .
what is this?
new policy .
flight got you nervous?
there's a problem , lamar .
i never did tell you about my son , did i?
he's a big fan of yours .
just remember that i was as good as any and better than most .
he wants to apply here .
i could have gone up and back and nobody wouldn't have been the wiser .
unfortunately , my son's not all that they promised .
but then , who knows what he could do?
right?
for future reference , right handed men don't hold it with their left .
just one of those things .
you're going to miss your flight , vincent .
for someone who was never meant for this world ,
i must confess , i'm suddenly having a hard time leaving it .
of course , they say every atom in our bodies was once part of a star .
maybe i'm not leaving .
maybe i'm going home .
