jenna !
my role model in everything nubian .
what are you doing here?
i thought you had to go to weight watchers camp this summer .
we wanted her to , but she insisted on going back to camp ovation .

spend sleepless nights and think about you
you said you loved me

my junior prom ,
i stayed home with a roll of cookie dough and tv land .
i watched my junior prom from outside in the bushes for three hours .
that's so stella dallas .
ls bert hanley really directing here this summer?
i thought he retired .
i thought he died .
he might have .
he was supposed to be here two days ago .
how does that happen?
he used to be huge .
he hasn't had a hit since childrehs crusade .
he never wrote another show .
i hope he directs the benefit this summer .

doht raih oh my parade .
that's original .
with the tugboat .
what is that supposed to be?
how you doing?
my name's vlad .

two thousand sunsets , yet not one sunrise .
no , no , no , no !
god damn you all !
you piss on the memory of the greatest playwright of the 20th century .
ln cuba we took our lives in our hands performing her work , waiting for castro's thugs to burst in and arrest us !
i don't understand what i'm saying .
of course you don't , you middle class piece of shit !
i'm doing the best i can .
that's what's so tragic .
leave her alone .
how about you , then?
have you had even one painful moment in your life since the doctor slapped you on your ass when you were born?
yeah .
tell me , then .
tell me your most painful moment , the one that makes you convulse with sobs when you think of it .
why would i do that in front of three strangers?
to be able to do it in front of 3, 000 .
back to the top , and try not to screw up the blocking this time .
eyes , eyes , nostrils , silent scream .
i have to go to the bathroom .
piss in the dumpster .
start again !
how was your first day of rehearsal?
it was okay .
i'm a little out of my element .
we really do a new show every two weeks?
and a benefit at the end of the summer .
jeez !
ellen said you were her hero today with that crazy director .
can i ask you something personal?
what made you come here?
i want to act .
why?
we just don't get many like you .
can i ask you something personal?
yeah .
you're gay , right?
how do you know?
have you ever experimented with heterosexuality?
you mean sleep with a straight guy?
what for?
a girl .
i can't even straighten my hair .
that's too bad .
you'd be a total playa .
got that whole latin thing going .
get a girl alone , throw on some salsa , whisper a little spanish in her ear .
you'd make out like a bandit .
i'll keep that in mind .
ls that your father?
that's stephen sondheim .
the greatest songwriter in musical theater .
i don't talk to my parents .
why not?
enough .
i have to keep some kind of mystery .
you'll grow bored with me and move on to someone younger .
good night , mike .
'night , vlad .
did he call me mike?
can i help you?
i'm not sure where i'm supposed to go .
i'm bert hanley .
it's about time .
where have you been?
you were supposed to be here two days ago .
you're right .
what's the use in lying?
i've been drinking for 72 hours .
you've been drinking?
not the way you make it sound when you say , " drinking? !
i'm fine now , really .
let's get started .
i'll get those .
i assumed that we would have some adult time to ourselves .
what show am i doing , anyway?
good times and bum times , i've seen them all
and , my dear , i'm still here
plush velvet sometimes , sometimes just pretzels and beer
but i'm here
i've run the gamut " a " to " z
three cheers and damn it , cest la vie
i got through all of last year
and i'm here
lord knows , at least i was there
and i'm here
look who's here
i'm still here
hi .
hi .
my name's vlad .
i don't mean to bother you or anything .
i just wanted to tell you how excited i am that you're here .
i did a production of the childrehs crusade at school this spring .
at first i did it just to get close to this girl .
but then it was so good .
it really took the characters of the kids so seriously .
that's really kind of you to say .
that song sihg for you .
i listened to the record , like , a hundred times just to get the chords right on my guitar .
it's not out on cd .
did you know that?
yeah , i knew that .
so , what shows have you done since then , mr. hanley?
thank you very much for coming by to visit , vlad .
thank you .
just give me a break .
you little ass kisser .
one , two , three , four .
quit dragging !
y'all better get your asses used to less sleep
'cause we're gonna have rehearsal all morning .
then lunch , then rehearsal .
then dinner , then rehearsal .
and the whole thing starts all over again the next day .
miss allen , we've all seen the beginning of fame .
fame . huh?
they do that on fame?
no .
again !
one , two , three , four .
'night , jenna .
shut up !
start again !
eyes , eyes , nostrils !
silent scream !
you're really talented .
i don't understand a single word of this crap , but you do it with such conviction .
a guy like you could have a really lucky summer in a place like this .
i'm starting to get that idea .
look .
first star .
i know my wish .
changing the subject .
do you have any brothers or sisters?
four brothers two older , two younger .
must be tough when the middle child is the special one .
throws everything out of whack .
special?
yeah .
i don't even remember the last time my parents called me by the right name .
you don't think you're special?
no .
seriously .
i don't mean like dorky boy band kind of special , which i'm sure you get all the time , but ...
there's something really there .
something substantial .
and you deserve something substantial in return .
somebody hit me with a rock so i shut up .
no .
made me feel great .
it's cold .
come here .
that worked .
ts 1 0 a . m .
everybody should be ih class .
here we are .
jeez .
be it ever so humble ...
what's up , fritzi?
would you like fritzi to fix you a bug juice or something?
no .
leave us .
bye , fritzi .
does she work for you now?
she likes to do little things for me .
it makes her feel like she belongs .
i'm supposed to be running lines with ellen .
she'll have the whole summer to do that brother sister bonding thing she does with all the boys .
sit .
you said you had a fantastic surprise for me .
what is it?
surprise .
i'm going to ask if i can dance with stella jolla in the " turkey lurkey " number .
i've been practicing really hard .
that's the part jill wants to play .
turkey lurkey " is the best number in the show .
i know .
i took dance classes all winter .
good for you .
the only thing is , it's a '60s show .
that means tight little miniskirts .
i'm just trying to be a friend .
what are you saying , that everyone would see my legs?
not that they're so bad .
they're just a little chunky .
but the halter tops .
i'd worry about my rolls jiggling around in the spotlight .
whereas the secretary character has some great one liners and wears sensible suits .
we just love it here .
we see a show every summer .
what did we see the kids do last year?
wit .
wit . right .
dark , but really entertaining .
it's turkey lurkey time
tom turkey ran away , but he just came home
it's turkey lurkey time
he's really home to stay , never one to roam
let's make a wish , and may all our wishes come true
a snowy , blowy christmas , a mistletoey christmas
a turkey lurkey christmas to you
a turkey lurkey christmas to you
it's loosey goosey time
she was a gadabout , but she's back again
it's loosey goosey time
her time is running out , and we all know when
let's make a wish , and may all our wishes come true
a snowy , blowy christmas , a mistletoey christmas
a loosey goosey christmas to you
a loosey goosey christmas to you
turkey lurkey , loosey goosey
some for uncle joe , some for cousin lucy
everybody gather round the table
dig in , dinner's being served
eat all the turkey you are able
can't you see a partridge in a pear tree?
climb up and bring it down for me
that's something i would like to see
a snowy , blowy christmas , a mistletoey christmas
a turkey lurkey christmas to you
jingle bells , jingle bells
i'm still here
jingle bells , jingle bells
i'm still here
jingle bells , jingle bells
sadness .
vlad , your cat's dead .
i'm sorry .
he was hit by a car this afternoon .
vlad , your mom's dead .
i'm sorry .
she got nailed by a car this afternoon .
sorry .
i like to practice in the mirror .
your parents coming to your show?
jesus , you still haven't called 'em?
what are you going to do when you have to go home?
i'm not going home .
where you going to live?
i'll find an apartment .
you'll end up on a milk carton .
they haven't called me , either .
how much you wanna bet they don't call me on my birthday?
then you have to be bigger than them .
how often are you going to get cast as romeo?
i mean it .
call 'em .
besides , who can resist you in them tights?
are you blushing?
you kidding?
i'm doing everything but bat my eyes .
call 'em .
buddy miller , sports counselor .
remember me?
think fast .
dear mr. flores , the school has determined that
due to your refusal to wear either a tuxedo
or an ankle length formal gown , you failed to meet the dress code ,
and therefore appropriate action was taken in refusing you entrance to this year's junior prom .
you didn't get in because of your hemline?
i've been looking all over for you .
what are you drinking?
chicken breast .
don't you think that's a little extreme?
it's her parents 'idea , the pricks .
it's like some nazi experiment .
they're just looking out for me .
you're only a few pounds heavier than ellen .
tell me something isn't it a pain in the ass to put on all that makeup every day?
i don't mind the extra effort so people have something nice to look at .
i think she looks wonderful .
we know !
looking good to attract the opposite sex has been a basic human impulse for almost a thousand years .
what about before that?
however old the world is .
lf you'd soften up a little , you'd land yourself a boyfriend and lose that hostile edge that's so unattractive .
drop dead .
that's the one .
i'd be happy to help .
you could be my project .
i'll put you on a diet .
i'll style your hair .
enough .
i heard about your little line learning session .
you got vlad to put his arm around you .
that must be like third base for someone who's never been touched by a boy , isn't it?
ellen , wait .
where do you think you're going?
you know , i think i know your sister cinderella .
there you are .
you disappeared so fast .
i looked everywhere for you .
where's your girlfriend?
she's not my girlfriend .
why'd you come after me?
i don't know .
'cause you were upset .
she's a bitch .
so was l .
no .
i like you , ellen .
i like you , too .
what is it that we're listening to , anyway?
nothing .
i can't deal with this anymore .
what?
i like regular music , too .
i like joni mitchell .
i know every album by heart .
they have this great new thing called drums .
you're gonna love it .
what's so special about this?
sometimes it's nice not to be special .
sometimes it's nice to listen to what everyone else listens to just to be normal for once .
dance with me .
jump off the roof .
come on , dance with me .
asshole !
just kidding .
just kidding .
fiddler oh the roof?
this is the last straw .
look at us .
do we look like any jews you know?
you could be sephardic .
look at those curly things on petie .
i don't think motel the tailor used a lot of hair relaxer .
it's color blind casting .
what do you want me to do?
porgy ahd bess?
brihg ih da noise?
why do we have to play white characters show after show , summer after summer?
i don't have enough black kids to do an all black show .
i want my little brother learning he can be himself and still get applause .
you know what i'm saying?
what are you gonna do about it?
and i am telling you
i'm not going
you're the best man i'll ever know
there's no way i can ever go
no , no , no , no way
no , no , no , no way i'm living without you
i'm not living without you
i don't wanna be free
i'm staying
i'm staying
and you , and you
you're gonna love me
you're gonna love me
and i am telling you
i'm not going
even though the rough times are showing
there's just no way
no way
skateboarding?
for someone with a name like vladimir , you sure are a clichd american teenager .
lf you don't like it , stop watching .
i'm not .
i'm reading .
sorry .
i'm only human .
call your parents , romeo .
get 'em up here .
and i am telling you
i'm not going
i'm staying
i'm staying
and you , and you , and you
you're gonna love me
you're gonna love me
yes
love me
you're gonna love me
i envy you .
you've probably known what you wanted to do since you were born .
when i was eight years old ,
i asked my father to send me to acting class .
and you know what he said?
there are five billion people in this world .
lf only one tenth of one percent of them want to be actors ,
that's still five million people .
do you really think you're prettier than five million people?
you're not even the prettiest one in your class .
i think you're very pretty .
why should that make me want to cry?
i would've asked you to your prom .
mom .
i'm sorry , did i wake you up?
it's nice to hear your voice , too .
i miss you too , mom .
can you guys come see my show?
great .
new cast lists are up .
i got joanne in compahy .
you're in it , too .
what are you doing?
nothing .
what is that?
ls that my underwear?
i was just washing them out .
we need to talk .
i think we need a little break from each other .
what?
it's something i've been meaning to bring up for a while now .
this whole thing is beginning to get a little weird .
i don't understand .
i've done everything you've asked me to .
i know , and it's been a great help , but the time has come for you to get some sort of life .
i have a life .
get another one .
i don't know why you're saying this .
i can be better .
you're not hearing me .
test me .
i'll do anything you say .
you're my best friend !
get away from me , you freak !
from now on ,
let's just go about our business and pretend like we never met .
okay?
i'm going out .
why don't you be gone when i get back .
you ready for our big opening night?
you're very intense back there in the chorus .
ls everything okay?
i'm a little frustrated .
frustration's a useless emotion .
lf you see something you want , you just got to go for it .
easy to say .
it's better to regret something you have done than something you haven't done .
trust me , i'm the expert .
really?
i've been watching you , and you are a scary little girl .
there's nothing you can't do if you put your mind to it .
thank you , mr. hanley .
you've been very helpful .
luhch is how beihg seved .
everybody should be at luhch .
i'd like to propose a toast .
here's to the ladies who lunch
everybody laugh
lounging in their caftans
and planning a brunch on their own behalf
i'm going to call it off .
i think you'd better .
wait .
what in the hell are you doing here?
i knew you'd be discussing stopping the show , and i just thought how disappointed the kids would be .
you scheming little bitch !
please !
i'm a child .
lf you think for one ...
save the speech , rummy .
she's fucked , i'm ready , and the goddamn show must go on .
so let's get cracking , shall we?
i'll drink to that
here's to the girls who just watch
aren't they the best?
when they get depressed , it's a bottle of scotch plus a little jest
another chance to disapprove
another brilliant zinger
another reason not to move
another vodka stinger
i'll drink to that
so here's to the girls on the go
everybody tries
look into their eyes and you'll see what they know
everybody dies
a toast to that invincible bunch
the dinosaurs surviving the crunch
let's hear it for the ladies who lunch
everybody rise
rise
two households , both alike in dignity in fair verona , where we lay our scene .
from ancient grudge break to new mutiny , where civil blood makes civil hands unclean .
romeo , come forth .
come forth , thou fearful man .
affliction is enamored of thy parts and thou art wedded to calamity .
father , 'tis i , romeo .
what news?
what is the prince's doom?
what sorrow craves acquaintance ...
tell me , chino ... ... how many bullets are left in this gun?
enough for you?
and you?
and you?
how many can i shoot and still have one left for me?
michael , where are you?
dude , we looked all over for you .
i heard about what happened .
i called them afterwards ... ... to make sure they weren't dead somewhere on the new york state thruway .
my father decided he couldn't put himself through seeing me .
what does that even mean?
it means they think i'm a freak ,
like the kids at my school .
let's face it , even here i'm in the upper third .
why don't you live at home?
prom night , my father looked at me bleeding in a dress .
he told me i brought it upon myself .
he said that if i did that when he were in school , he'd have been one of those boys kicking my ass , too .
that's crazy .
when it was happening ,
i just projected myself out of it , and in my head i went somewhere else .
where?
here .
why would you wear a dress to your prom , dude?
you had to know you were going to get creamed .
i don't get that .
of course you don't get that .
that's because your life is pretty damn close to perfect .
mine is like , one from column " a , " one from column " shit .
perfect .
how about this?
3 , 4 , 6 , 1 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 4 , 10 , 4 , 1 4 , 3 , 1 7 , 1 , 1 8 , 6 , 24 , 4 , 28 , 3 , 31 , 4 .
what's that?
have you ever heard of ocd?
i count letters involuntarily .
that was " one from column 'a , 'one from column 'shit . " '
i don't understand .
it's like ,
lf i don't take my pill , then every time someone speaks , or if i have an idea , or if somebody talks anything
i break it down into words , then into letters , and i add them up .
3 , 1 , 3 , 4 , 2 .
and i add them up .
i take those numbers , and i add them up backwards .
3 , 1 , 3 , 4 , 2 was 6 , 3 , 9 , 1 , 10 , 3 , 1 3 , 4 .
the last word , plus the word before that , plus the word before that , and on and on ... ... till it ends in a prime number .
it's , like , constantly in my head .
i take it all back .
that's the sickest thing i ever heard .
i know .
it's weird 'cause it's , like , it's just there .
3 , 4 , 5 , 9 , 3 , 1 2 , 3 .
it's just there .
it's crazy .
oh , my god .
that's why i act .
that's why i want to be an actor .
'cause when i'm acting , it's not there if it's really going good .
it's like the character doesn't have it ... ... so i don't have it .
a teenage prozac junkie .
that's my perfect life .
i guess we're both freaks .
you can take a pill for yours .
i'm still some teenage drag queen with bad skin who can't put on a dress without getting the crap beat out of him .
let's get out of here , man .
good morhihg . campers .
time to rise ahd shihe .
todays wake up sohg is a special bithday dedicatioh to michael flores .
happy bithday .
michael .
surprise !
happy birthday !
oh , my god , look at you !
the only thing i have to say is , the hair on my legs better grow back , or else somebody's getting sued .
you did not !
god shave the queen .
surprise !
drag kings " r " us !
make a wish .
right at this moment , i have everything i want .
so ...
i'll give this wish to you guys .
i sing for you
and only you
wherever i go , i find you
you're in the sound of every " hello
ln everything i do
you're the song i was destined to know
and i only sing for you
you went away
i should have known
you'd leave so many dreams behind you
thought i'd be fine just being alone
i didn't have a clue
but my heart had a mind of its own
and would only sing for you
you're in the sound of rain
who are you people?
what planet did you beam down from?
i'm serious .
lf i can teach you one thing , which is supposed to be my job here ... ... it'd be that you should all go home .
michael bennett's dead .
bob fosse is dead .
times square is a theme park now .
i hate to be the grinch , but it's not normal what goes on up here .
somebody has got to warn you .
teenage faghags become adult faghags .
straight boys are straight .
you can't turn 'em just because you need to be loved .
the foundation that's being laid here is not going to help you in the real world .
it's going to lead to waitressing jobs and bitterness and the obsessive , pointless collecting of out of print original cast albums .
i don't know what your problem is , and i don't really care .
maybe you're a son of a bitch just 'cause you haven't written a show in , like , a million years .
or maybe you're just a stupid drunk , but those kids , they look up to you .
and they don't deserve to be treated like that .
they "?
did you think i wasn't talking to you , too?
or did i forget to mention that you're a fraud who has to be everybody's golden boy , or you'll just shrivel up?
i've taken shots at drunks before .
don't think i have some honor code about it .
bring it on .
what is your problem?
i don't have a problem .
there's a theater in brooklyn that's got a problem .
seems they need a rehearsal pianist , and they thought i might just be hard up enough to oblige .
so i sit in hot , stinking traffic for three hours just to drive down there to find out it's not the 200th revival of my one hit show they wanted .
you should never meet your heroes .
they always disappoint you .
come on , kid .
come here .
help me out .
i think i'm going to be sick .
oh , jesus !
god !
get it away .
you don't even know what it is .
i don't care . lf it's been touched by him , it's diseased .
oh , my god .
spit .
it's everything he's written since the childrehs crusade .
there's a ton more at his place .
it's like the holy grail of musical theater .
this one doesn't look so good .
some are lousy , but most of 'em are great .
it's like they don't even seem like they're from shows .
they're just songs he wrote .
there's funk , gospel .
there's this awesome , rootsy neil young song .
come on .
neil young?
he doesn't know i took 'em .
they're just copies .
what are you going to do with them?
what time's that benefit rehearsal start tomorrow?
1 2 : 00 to 3 : 00 .
that's it?
ever since michael's drag party , glen's been on a crusade to make us more like a normal camp , so he's cutting back the benefit rehearsals to three hours a day .
that's enough time .
time for what?
he'll be late .
he's always late .
for ...?
come on .
outside my house is a cactus plant
they call the century tree
only once in a hundred years
it flowers gracefully
and you never know when it will bloom
hey , do you want to come out and play the game?
it's never too late
hey , do you want to come out and play the game?
it's never too late
clementine hunter was 54 before she packed up her paint
old uncle taylor was 81
when he rode his bike across the plains of china
and the sun was shining on that day
just like today
do you want to come out and play the game?
it's never too late
hey , do you want to come out and play the game?
it's never too late
didn't know how to tell her for over 30 years
he kept locked up inside himself , and no one saw the tears
then she went away , and he woke up that day
now he brings roses to his sweetheart
she lives most anywhere
he sees someone suffering
he knows that despair
he offers them a rose and some quiet prose
'bout dancing in a shimmering ballroom
'cause you never know when they will bloom
hey , do you want to come out and play the game?
it's never too late to play the game
hey , do you want to come out and play the game?
it's never too late
never too late to play the game
hey , do you want to come out and play the game?
and play the game , it's never too late
never too late
hey , do you want to come out and play the game?
and play ...
hey , do you want to come out and play the game?
it's never too late
it's never too late , never too late
hey , do you want to come out and play the game?
it's never too late
it's never too late
hey , do you want to come out and play the game?
it's never too late
hey , do you want to come out and play the game?
wanna come out , wanna come out
it's never too late

i'm glad .
but not on three hours 'rehearsal a day .
you tell me , am i wrong?
am i doing such a horrible thing?
i don't know .
i was like you , except i was feeling sorry for myself , and i thought these kids needed a hard dose of reality , so i gave it to them .
both barrels .
but i've been watching them , and i was wrong .
they're a bunch of little freaks .
the more normal we try to make them , the more lonely and isolated they're gonna feel .
summer is almost over , glen .
let's all go out like pros .

dee , ehtra .

you want to know?
yeah .

no way .

dee .
dee?
you slept with a girl?
you slept with a girl?
you're so full of shit .
i don't believe you .
i mean , why would you?
maybe i didn't want a whole lifetime of feeling the way i have so far .
i'm asking dee .
don't .
i'm calling your bluff .
don't be a jerk .
what're you gonna do?
ellen's not here .
i know .
what are you doing?
a journal .
oh , my god !
michael told me .
that punk !
i'm going to give him a bitch slap so hard .
this is the trippiest thing i ever  all right .
could he do it , even?
were his eyes open?
nothing against you , it's just ...
lf you wanna know , he talked about you most of the time .
during?
who knows?
i finally tuned him out .
come on .
seriously , tell me .
why are you so interested , anyway?
what's going on with you two?
nothing .
why?
what did he say?
i'm just saying you guys hang out an awful lot .
so what?
i'm straight .
straight .
all right .
you don't believe me?
all i'm saying is that people talk .
sorry .
that was stupid .
it wasn't that stupid .
do you know how long it's been since a guy's liked me that wasn't gay?
i don't like you .
i mean , i like you , but that's not why i did that .
i don't know why i did that .
it's all right .
wait .
you just slept with michael .
i'm sorry .
then go back to your boyfriend .
shut up .
why don't you make me?
shit !
come on , wait up !
leave me alone .
wait up !
don't follow me !
oh , baby !
doesn't she look pretty?
i missed you so much !
you look so beautiful .
i don't understand .
how can you spend all summer with your jaw wired shut and still look like that?
fred !
i'll tell you what , we'll keep it on for fall term .
you won't be sneaking milkshakes with me around the house .
i have to get ready .
what?
oh , my god , it's him .
stephen sondheim .
they called places already .
you're not even dressed yet?
how paranoid can you be?
oh , my god .
was that your plan?
did you put something in there?
i only wish i'd thought of it .
can you please pass the base?
thank you .
this is ridiculous .
lf you say one more syilable ,
i will shove a powder puff down your windpipe ...
do not underestimate my ass , because i will knock you flat .
girls , why don't we  butt out .
and there's no such thing as bisexuality , you know .
julie?
what are you doing here?
i took the bus .
how are you?
i'm good .
how about you?
good .
i give up .
you give up?
julie , this is ellen , michael , and dee .
listen , is there somewhere private we can go?
right now?
i have a show .
i'll see you after , okay?
great .
bye .
bye .
what?
i hardly know where to begin .
why didn't you tell us you had a girlfriend?
you didn't ask .
you never asked me if i had a boyfriend , but if i did , i would've said something ...
except you assumed i wouldn't have a boyfriend .
right .
no sense in asking a question like that to someone like me , right?
stop it .
and i was supposed to assume that you did have a girlfriend .
and of course that you screw around .
that's not true .
i'm sorry about dee .
it's just ...
i have no excuse .
it's all my fault .
maybe you and i only went out because i thought it would make you happy .
i'm sorry .
right .
i knew that .
i knew that all along .
i guess i just didn't care .
but tell me one thing .
what was going to happen to us when we got back home?
places !
jesus christ !
oh , god !
you sabotaged my makeup !
you bitch !
i did not .
sit down .
i can't do it .
come on , jenna .
fritzi's got multiple fractures , and jill's face looks like 40 miles of bad road .
you've got to do it .
i know you're scared .
it's not that .
my parents are here .
it's about time they met their daughter .
here in the dark i stand before you
you know this is my chance to show you my heart
this is the start

good job , bert .
really terrific .
thank you .
i had no idea you chaired this benefit .
i'm giving a party on the 1 8th .
i'll give you a call .
great .
love to .
who's that?
go away .
what are you doing?
i'm going swimming .
don't !
i don't even want to talk to you !
i want to apologize .
you are either the biggest closet case i've ever seen , or you're just plain evil .
why?
i thought now that you're straight ...
don't get carried away .
i slept with her 'cause of you .
me?
i figured you might feel less threatened if you thought i was capable of sex with a woman .
i don't even know how to respond to that , dude .
with a straitjacket , perhaps?
things went so good with dee .
lsn't it just possible that you're ...
no .
the only thing that's possible now is i'll get beat up once too often and decide to be with some woman because i know i can .
it's not exactly something i wish i knew .
you can't pin that on me .
we can't pin anything on you 'cause you're perfect .
i'm not perfect !
except for that little obsessive compulsive thing .
even that makes you kind of sexily damaged .
i hate people like you .
i really do .
oh , my god .
water's freezing .
why are you doing this?
doing what?
skinny dipping .
maybe i do flirt , but if i do , it's only because i want to be liked .
and ... maybe i'm a little confused .
you're not confused .
you like girls .
you're right .
i do .
i was just trying to give you what you want .
i'm an asshole .
man , i don't know .
i just love attention .
i'm an attention junkie , i guess .
why do i do shit like that?
do you forgive me?
do you?
come on !
do you?
do you forgive me?
do you?
lf i forgive you , will you get off of me?
yeah .
then no .
oh , god .
michael , who are you with?
don't hate me .
i made up with him .
where's julie?
she broke up with me .
what?
she came here 'cause she wanted to tell me in person .
well , well , well .
how's that for a little opening night present?
how does it feel to be on the other end , lover boy?
actually ...
never mind .
what?
now that camp's almost over , and we live kind of close to each other ,
i was hoping that we can go out sometime .
i know you're not asking girlfriend out for a date after all this .
lf she'll forgive me .
this boy not only has cojohes . but he's got burritos and huevos rancheros , too .
okay .
what?
really?
i'll go out with you .
you're like some jenny jones guest !
eventually i have to start hanging out with boys who don't wear dresses .
i thought we came here to go swimming .
you coming in?
it's pretty cold .
i'll take my chances .
it's not that cold .
don't be a girl .
leave that to michael .
you two are like a bad car wreck .
i wash my hands of the both of you !
it's cold !
quit splashing !
for the want of a nail
the world was lost
for the want of a nail
the world was lost
the want of a nail
the want of a nail
for the want of a nail , the shoe was lost
for the want of a shoe , the horse was lost
for the want of a horse , the rider was lost
for the want of a rider , the message was lost
for the want of a nail , the world was lost
for the want of a nail , the world was lost
the want of a nail
the want of a nail
for the want of a rider , the message was lost
for the want of a message , the battle was lost
for the want of a battle , the war was lost
for the want of a war , the kingdom was lost
the want of a nail , the world was lost
the want of a nail
i've been wrong
i had plans so big
but the devil's in the details
i left out one thing
no one to love me
no one to love me
and no one to love
what's all this talk about horses and war?
put yourself in the place of the man at the forge
and day after day you live a life without love
till the morning you can't take it anymore
and you don't get up
multiply it a billion times
spread it all around the world
put the curse of loneliness on every boy and every girl
until everybody's kickin ', everybody's scratchin '
everything seems to fail
and it was all
all
for the want of a nail
the want of a nail
tell me , what else could the answer be?
the want of a nail , not one thing
the want of a nail
want of a nail , the world was lost ...
action .
what a dump .
hey , where's that from?
what a dump .
how would i know , martha?
so you weht to this camp .
what was that like?
i was consistently miscast
titus andronicus , stanley kowalski .
then there was the year they couldn't find a girl to cast as annie , so i played " andy .
