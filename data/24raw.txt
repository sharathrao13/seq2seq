cheerio , lads !
quiet , croker !
you're not out yet .
sorry , sir .
good luck , charles .
remember me to the old woman !
i will , harry , i will .
say hello to the big world .
bye bye .
goodbye , mr bridger .
he said , " goodbye , mr bridger .
well , he's going .
as long as he doesn't come back .
that's all i care .
they say he's going to do a job in ltaly .
i hope he likes spaghetti .
they serve it four times a day in ltalian prisons .
well , you're the last person i expected to see , lorna .
oh , charlie , i've been counting the days .
yeah?
well , why didn't you come and see me when i was inside?
charlie , you know that's not my scene .
sitting holding your hands across the table , with those weeping wives around with their howling kids , the guards looking at me as if something's hidden up my dress .
i did miss you , charlie .
yeah?
erm ...
i , erm ... made an appointment for you to go to the tailor first .
then on to the shirtmaker ...
this car belongs to the pakistani ambassador .
it does?
typical , isn't it?
out of jail five minutes and already i'm in a hot car .
i just wanted you to come out in style , baby !
take me to my tailor .
very elegant , sir , though you've put on a little weight .
well , er ...
i've been in america .
it's the bread in the hamburgers .
is that so?
well , i'm glad you're out .
i mean , back .
i don't want to be rude , charles , but times have changed .
adrian , when i went in that was all the go .
what did you do?
life?
you know , you could put all these in a museum .
i'll tell you what i'll do with you , adrian .
i'll take this lot now .
revolting .
eh?
i'll take this lot now .
you wrap 'em up .
and will you shorten the sleeves , love?
i'm not a gorilla .
yes !
well , there we are , captain croker .
i think you'll find we've kept it in perfect tone .
i'll run the engine for you , shall i?
you'll be able to hear what it sounds like .
there , how's that?
i say .
yes?
i say .
hello?
there you are .
i thought i'd lost you !
no , i came round here .
erm ...
i was just thinking , maybe it needs a little more air through the second carburettor .
oh , do you think so?
listen .
yes , maybe you're right .
i'll ...
i'll do it .
just stay there .
would you open the bonnet for me , please?
thank you .
i wonder if you'd hold this for me?
the , er ...?
the bonnet .
of course .
thank you .
i didn't quite ...
yes .
there we are .
you want me to ...
hold .
thank you .
there we are .
now ...
yes .
i can , er ...
how are you doing?
i can see what's wrong .
it's very small .
no , i don't know .
it's alright .
leave it , leave it .
shall i ...?
yes , you shut it and i'll lock it .
thank you .
how are you doing?
long time since i was in here .
i dare say !
there we are .
i haven't been in this car for so long .
yes , i gather you've been in india for two years , sir .
yes , shooting tigers .
really?
splendid .
the garage bill , sir .
yes?
i'm afraid it's 200 .
if you insist , we can charge it .
no .
please !
there's a bounty for shooting tigers .
well ...
yes , it's 50 a head .
really?
there's no need to pay ...
these are bundles of 200 .
there's no need to pay now .
it's alright .
yes , you must have shot an awful lot of tigers , sir .
yes , i used a machine gun .
calling mr r j williams .
mr williams to reception , please ...
lord croker .
i am expected .
yes , your lordship .
suite 602 .
and there's a message .
thank you .
hello , charlie !
shut the door , charlie .
you'll cause a terrible draught .
ladies?
charlie !
hello , charlie !
love you , charlie .
ciao !
nice charlie .
good to see you , charlie .
well , i thought , a coming out present !
very nice .
now , what would you like?
everything .
where's your old man?
dead .
in the alps , in a car crash .
it wasn't an accident .
oh .
well , there goes the job , then .
wait , mr croker .
yes , mrs beckerman?
this is for you .
what's this?
some sort of a consolation prize?
plans that my husband didn't have time to complete .
he wants you to finish them .
oh , he does , does he?
tell me , erm ... where do you figure in the plans your husband didn't have time to complete?
i don't .
i am going to new york tomorrow at 6 : 00am .
ah .
pity .
but ... that still gives us four hours to kill .
and you still in your widow's weeds ...
charlie croker , i am dead .
hello , roger .
i have arranged for my widow
to get material to you in england .
yes , i got it .
there you must find the backing to do the job .
you must , charlie .
because it is a work of genius .
just think of it .
a city in chaos , a smash and grab raid and four million dollars through a traffic jam .
four million dollars?
this is the city of turin , the industrial capital of italy .
the most modern in europe , famed for its architecture , and soon , i trust , for the greatest robbery of the 20th century .
this is the flat armoured convoy .
it leaves turin airport every week .
it never carries less than four million dollars .
i think we could take that over .
to reach its destination the convoy has to travel through one of the busiest traffic systems in europe , a system controlled by television cameras and by the computer in this building , the turin traffic control centre .
if you can get into this room , charlie , you will cause the biggest traffic jam in the history of the world .
every street will be paralysed .
and then you will have a chance to ambush that convoy .
very nice .
now , charlie , first you neutralise the tv cameras which overlook the convoy's route .
you do this with these little gadgets here .
look .
yeah .
second , you break into the computer building and substitute this new program .
got it .
this causes the jam .
right .
third , you attack the convoy in your own inimitable way , charlie .
and fourth , you escape , on the only route out of the city which is not blocked up with traffic .
you'll find details of the route in this portfolio .
within just two hours , you will be over the alps and into switzerland .
and within three you'll have the money safe in a geneva bank .
make it work , charlie !
i will , roger .
four million dollars , through a traffic jam .
money received from brighton is 15, 000 .
hello .
camp freddie?
croker !
aren't you in italy?
i want to see bridger .
mr bridger to you .
i've got a job .
if it's the gpo , city road , it's being done next week .
this job is bigger than anything bridger's done up until now .
if it's the bank of england , it's out .
mr bridger's very worried about the economy .
exactly , freddie !
tell bridger this is a foreign job to help with this country's balance of payments .
charlie , i don't think you have the kind of scheme that yields the size of profit mr bridger is accustomed to .
but , freddie , this job is big .
charlie , you wouldn't even know how to spell big .
b i g. big .
now , butch harry , tell us about fulham .
well , now ...
fulham .
a bit dodgy at the moment .
how are you?
how do you feel about a little outing?
hello , hazel .
hazel , my lovely , out you come .
come on , then .
there you are .
it's a long time since you've seen the nightlife , innit?
where's my torch?
where's my bloody torch?
good evening , mr bridger .
croker !
mr bridger , i've got a job lined up .
get out of here .
it's all here .
maps , drawings , plans , everything .
you've been put up to this , bribed to upset my natural rhythm and ruin my health .
no , mr bridger .
this is important .
four million dollars .
europe .
the common market .
italy , the flat car factory .
croker , this is my toilet .
please .
just read it .
get out .
are you alright , mr bridger?
are you alright?
he's alright !
i can always take it to the americans .
they're people who recognise young talent , give it a chance , they are .
last night , mr governor , my toilet was broken into .
toilet?
toilet .
broken into?
broken into .
well , i'm ... terribly sorry .
there are some places which , to an englishman , are sacred .
well , i've apologised , bridger .
and so you should have .
you are not doing your job properly .
her majesty's prison is there not only to keep people getting out , but to prevent people getting in .
you are symptomatic of the lazy , unimaginative management which is driving this country on the rocks !
well ... is there anything else?
no , thank you , governor .
by the way , mr bridger , did you happen to recognise the man who so rudely interrupted you?
i've never seen him before in my life .
i want charlie croker given a good going over .
yes , mr bridger .
tell camp freddie .
yes , mr bridger .
i don't want him killed .
just given a good going over .
i understand exactly what you mean .
do you , keats?
that's very imaginative of you .
sir , two volumes of the anglo american trade .
and uk balance of payments , 1966 and '67 .
and ...
i've also brought you the illustrated london news , sir .
for why , keats , for why?
the queen's in it , sir .
hmm .
that's good of you .
er ... sir , i often wonder whether you're going to top your career by doing a job on their house .
keats , there are more things to life than breaking and entering .
yes , mr bridger .
while we're on the subject ,
i notice that some of that young mob in e block don't stand for the national anthem , at the end of the nightly tv .
tell them to do so , or they will incur my displeasure .
yes , mr bridger .
alright , be off with you .
get the word to camp freddie .
sir .
right then , fred , come on .
wait a minute .
take your filthy clothes , too !
this is my man , my territory , and don't come back !
charlie's been caught on the job .
ok , charlie .
alright , where are you?
i know you're in here .
there's no use hiding .
you had three birds in here .
you didn't mind at the hotel .
that was a coming out present .
i didn't get a chance to enjoy it .
i didn't enjoy it today , neither .
coming in causing a fracas .
ask me where i've been .
you've been with the law .
yes , for taking the ambassador's car and for not paying the hotel bill .
you deserted me !
don't come the moody .
you know how the game is .
no , you left me to my fate .
usual one , was it?
24 hours in prison .
it was humiliating .
how did you get out?
the ambassador for pakistan was very sweet .
very sweet , was he?
and so was the hotel manager .
lorna , i knew you'd be alright .
no thanks to you , charlie croker , i can tell you .
lorna , i was busy , wasn't i? !
oh !
so i see !
so i came in here and saw !
i want you out .
if you don't think i mean it , then you're wrong !
charlie !
it's the law , charlie !
what did you tell them?
would i tell them anything?
of course you would .
morning .
hello , croker .
we've come with mr bridger's compliments .
sorry it's like this , charlie .
listen , lads , er ... you wouldn't hit a fella ... with no trousers on .
would you?
ok , then , put 'em on .
get away from me !
have you seen croker?
yes , mr bridger .
well , i want you to see him again .
he won't take kindly to that .
i'm interested in his scheme .
but , mr bridger ...
what you fail to realise is that we have a new objective .
the chinese are giving flat four million dollars in gold , as a down payment on a car plant they're constructing near peking .
but croker ...
croker can handle it .
he's got everything going for him .
there's even a football match in turin the day before the delivery .
england versus ltaly .
the english supporters can cover his movements , even help him , if required .
there's only one snag .
we need an expert in computers to look after the technical end .
the top man is professor peach .
i've seen him on television .
tell croker to get him .
but how?
maybe the professor's not bent .
camp freddie , everybody in the world is bent .
well , my brother's no longer with us , i'm afraid .
no .
you mean , he's ...
oh , no , no , nothing like that .
well , actually , he's in a home .
yes .
we thought it best .
for his own good .
er ... was it , er ... serious , miss peach?
pam .
serious , was it?
what?
your brother .
in the home .
oh , yes , i'm afraid it was quite serious , dear .
isn't this greenfly awful?
yes .
yes , well , not to put a too fine point to it , he was discovered ... in the lounge .
er ... doing what , miss peach?
where?
in the , er ... lounge .
oh , yes , he was doing it .
yes .
what?
oh .
well , something quite obscene .
with annette .
a net?
annette .
she was terrified , of course .
naturally .
yes , well , would you like some tea?
eh?
tea .
would you like some?
you're very kind .
yes , please .
good .
excuse me a minute .
annette?
annette , would you serve tea in the lounge , dear?
i shouldn't let her do that , dear .
that gives them ideas .
this is annette .
professor peach , do you see what i'm getting at?
mmm .
your brawn , my brain .
i'm not stupid , you know .
cooperation , isn't it?
like that flagpole out there .
flagpole?
the flagpole in the yard .
i know if there was a convex mirror up there , 27 vertical , 42 horizontal , i could see straight into matron's bedroom !
but somebody else would have to be up the pole .
couldn't do it myself .
cooperation , you see?
she's a big woman .
here ...
wait till you see them italian birds .
are they big?
i like them big .
they're enormous .
really?
very , very , very big .
would we , er ... wear stockings over our heads?
no need for you to .
oh .
i'd like that .
i could steal one of matron's , couldn't i?
we'll have you out of here in no time .
i wouldn't want to get matron into trouble .
not that way , anyway !
she's big .
big !
look out the window , professor .
what?
look out at my car .
car?
wh wh what car?
down there .
gentlemen , gentlemen .
please , gentlemen .
please .
we are about to do a job in italy and i would like to introduce you all to each other .
first , bill bailey .
he'll be my number two .
you all know bill .
he's just done three years in parkhurst .
as honest as the day is long .
you can trust him .
second , the getaway .
this will be done in three mini coopers .
and they will be driven by chris , tony and dominic .
hello , chaps .
alright !
these chinless wonders will get you out of turin faster than anyone else on four wheels .
remember that .
when we get to the alps , we will transfer to a coach .
the coach will be driven by william here , better known as big william , for very obvious reasons .
now , we come to the professor here , who is in charge of all matters relating to the turin computer .
i don't want anyone putting him down because he's a man of reading .
i know he's got some ... very funny habits , but make him feel at home .
he's very important to the operation .
finally , and very quickly , i would like to introduce all the lads who are going to do the job with me .
arthur , frank , rozzer , coco ,
yellow , camp freddie you all know .
roger , dave and lorna will be in reserve with three fast cars in case anything goes wrong .
right?
now , it's a very difficult job and the only way to get through it is , we all work together as a team .
and that means you do everything i say .
here's charlie .
putting the jib on .
don't just stand there .
get on with something .
i'm seeing he does it right .
get on with it .
rozzer?
trouble with his differential .
tell him to hurry up .
hurry up .
dippers for the continent .
other way round .
are they quartz iodide?
that's right , guvnor .
alright .
we couldn't afford gold , so we're using lead .
will it take the weight?
eh?
take the weight .
will it take the weight?
mind your face , charles .
alright?
ok , but i don't like the colour .
it's beautiful , beautiful , beautiful !
carry on .
he really needs all this equipment?
he says he does .
no .
you're meant to use your brakes , chris .
terribly sorry , charles .
how many cars have we got left?
a couple .
ok , next one .
let's hope he gets it right .
what do you mean they're written off?
a series of accidents , mr bridger .
i promise there'll be no more .
five , four , three , two , one .
go .
you're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off !
how's your new house , fred?
very nice , mr bridger , thank you .
very nice .
my pleasure .
beckerman's done his homework very well .
the getaway is possible , but not easy .
for a start , the attack has to be made in this square .
and it must be completed inside of three minutes .
apart from knocking over a few old dears , we'll manage it .
you all understand what you've got to do?
ok?
now , bill .
er ...
oh , yeah .
the transporters will move in here and here .
they'll block off the main drag .
right .
roger .
erm ...
arthur and lorna park the three fast cars here in case we have to make a quick getaway .
correct .
it's 12 : 10 .
the bullion van will be entering the piazza and will be forced slowly towards the centre .
it's the old over and under routine .
first we go over the traffic , through the museums .
and then under again .
and up into this church .
the difficulty is here .
if the police can get a car onto that bridge before we've got across it , we're done for .
but it's a gamble we've got to take .
now , the bullion wagon is here .
right?
dominic .
we get into the minis behind the piazza .
right .
arthur .
we drive the land rover into the square .
piazza , arthur , piazza .
sorry , charlie .
piazza .
the land rover is in the piazza .
and we come in right behind target .
that's it .
wallop .
but since the bridge will be blocked by traffic the only possible way out is across the weir , which runs along by the side of the bridge .
i've only one comment about that , mr bridger .
good luck .
keats , i think we'd better arrange ... a funeral .
all ready to go , croker?
yes , mr bridger .
the plans have been worked out to the last detail?
yes , mr bridger .
everything taken care of?
yes , mr bridger .
you've overlooked one thing .
the mafia .
they'll be waiting for you .
in every shot of camp freddie's film there's a mafia man .
if they were on to beckerman they're on to us .
you're not thinking of calling it off?
as long as you know what you're taking on .
yes .
the mafia .
yes .
the mafia .
you are about to take a half a ton of gold , in broad daylight , from under their noses .
they won't like that .
that's why they killed beckerman .
a question of prestige , is it?
yes , it's a question of prestige .
if you go through with this , you've got to win .
if you muck it up , don't ever think of coming back , except in your coffin .
who's that lot?
the drivers .
that lot smashed up my cars .
practice makes perfect , mr bridger .
you pick 'em , don't you?
mr bridger will now say a few words .
what?
your speech , sir .
we have come here to pay our respects to great aunt nellie .
she brought us up properly and taught us loyalty .
i want you to remember that during these next few days .
i also want you to remember that if you don't come back with the goods ,
nellie here will turn in her grave .
and , likely as not , jump right out of it and kick your teeth in .
dave , take the valley road to turin , ok?
go .
you three take the minis along the b road and keep the speed down .
right , go on , away you go .
freddie , stay with the bus .
big william , take the bus along the main road .
go !
go !
you lot , stay with me .
we'll go round the mountain route .
where's peach?
hey !
what do you think this is?
a sunday school outing?
pity people aren't as lovely as flowers .
take your flowers and get in the car .
hurry up .
mr croker?
that's right .
six weeks ago , a friend of yours met with an accident on this very road .
so?
do you mind if i show you how?
no .
you just lost him his insurance bonus .
it cost beckerman his life .
listen , the gold arrives tomorrow .
and you think you can pick it up
like a bunch of groceries in the supermarket , hmm?
just how are you going to do it?
oh , excuse me .
does mr bridger think he can take over europe from a prison cell?
your car?
yeah .
pretty car .
paid for?
very funny .
you'll be making a grave error if you kill us .
there are a quarter of a million italians in britain .
and they'll be made to suffer .
every restaurant , cafe , ice cream parlour , gambling den and nightclub in london , liverpool and glasgow , will be smashed .
mr bridger will drive them into the sea .
well , gentlemen , it's a long walk back to england .
and it's that way .
good morning .
may i salute our american cousin signor francesco cosca and his lovely wife?
and may i raise my glass to signor altabani and his most beautiful wife , to thank him for his hospitality?
and to congratulate him on the way he handled the english mob this morning .
i would not be too sure about the english , cousin .
they wouldn't dare !
they are not so stupid as they look .
candles !
quickly !
gentlemen , we must assume they are here .
got your passport?
i think so .
you need your passport directly after the tickets .
as you walk to the plane look neither right nor left .
just look straight ahead .
ok?
keep going straight ahead .
geneva , please .
got it?
neither to the right .
nor to the left .
straight ahead .
left .
straight ahead .
and keep going .
charlie , listen !
the plan was that we stay here .
the plan's changed .
but why , charlie?
why?
because you're a liability .
lorna , you see that lot out there?
if we slip up , they'll tear us apart .
and ...
i don't want you involved any more .
charlie?
what?
you care?
get on the , er ... plane .
i'll see you ... in geneva .
have a cup of tea ready .
bye bye , charlie !
get on the plane .
get on the plane .
i love you , charlie !
hello , charlie !
hello , lads .
hello , charles .
hello , chris .
before we leave ...
bill?
yes , charlie?
i want every tin burned .
no fingerprints on anything in the house .
we're wearing gloves .
you can't be too careful .
is there a toilet here?
of sorts .
out the back .
wash the handle and the seat .
no prints on that , either .
right , here is the crunch .
do you all know how to get there?
actually , we can all read maps .
the map will be in your head .
i'm burning this one .
any questions?
without the two jags and the aston , what if anything does go wrong?
put your gloves on .
anything else?
shall we synchronise our watches?
nuts to your watches .
you just be there by quarter to and don't get stuck in the traffic jam .
anything else?
right .
away you go .
oh !
one more thing .
just remember , in this country they drive on the wrong side of the road .
bill?
yes , charlie?
bill !
yes , charlie?
burn this for me , will you?
yes , charlie .
oh , bill?
yes , charlie?
get rid of this lot .
yes , charlie .
they're in a trattoria in the city .
they know where to put these?
yes , you can see the cameras on the rooftops .
i can't argue .
me in the front , you in the back .
he wants to sit up front with the driver .
i get sick in the back .
i'll get my migraine .
i'll be out like a light .
you are not going to be sick .
you're not going to have migraine .
everybody is sitting in the back of the motor .
me in the back of the motor , with my asthma?
one more word out of you , arthur ...
alright?
alright .
now , everybody , all your gear in here .
get your gear out .
pens , wallets , passports , photos of your girlfriend .
and those cards .
put 'em in 'ere .
i'm going to need these cards .
what?
put them in here !
i want mascots , money , bottle openers . ... in london i was up drainpipes and the game was up .
all i had to do , all the time .
what?
i'm getting a contact !
let's hear it .
turn it up .
i'll turn it up .
how about that? !
how about what?
they've finished loading the gold .
right , get dressed .
right , away you go .
away you go .
grazie .
molto bene , dad .
ok , let's go .
can you direct me to corso garibaldi street?
bloody foreigners .
excuse me .
blimey !
bloody grand prix !
what the devil is happening?
a traffic jam .
it gets worse every time .
we've lost the convoy .
indietro !
any minute now .
it's like the black hole of calcutta in here .
shut it , arthur .
what are they gabbling about , franco?
complaining about the jam .
it won't be the only complaint .
keep calm .
get off my feet !
alright , alright !
get yourselves sorted out and shut up !
no one talks now except me .
now , now , now !
now !
get in front of it !
put your helmets on .
hold tight .
now !
go round !
get in front of it .
oi !
put that bloody water cannon out !
ok , bill .
in you come !
in !
in !
back !
back !
hey !
unload !
unload !
where do you think you're going? !
get on with it !
get in the car .
get back up there .
if anybody comes through , hit 'em .
ok , charlie , that's it .
right .
you , you and you in the dormobile .
get in the car .
oi !
get in the dormobile .
get your finger out .
get a move on , then !
well , look happy , you stupid bastards !
we won , didn't we?
they went thattaway .
i could eat a horse !
good luck !
put your foot down , tony .
they're getting rather close .
look out , look out , it's charlie !
look for that bloody exit .
we can't go round here all night .
manzo?
yes , sir .
check the station .
all trains .
check all names of passengers who boarded planes at linate or malpensa .
this was a big operation .
those engaged in the earlier part will probably have left by air .
check the autostradas .
the police will do this .
we know them , the police don't .
get my plane ready .
they can't get out in this mess .
if they planned this jam , they planned a way out .
i think you might try to keep up .
alright !
here , make a wish .
they're behind us .
