besides , you know , they're ... they're good for a laugh .
you're a big laugher , are you?
oh , yeah .
oh .
mm hmm .
they come here looking for the magic ... expecting to find romance ... when they can't find it any other place .
maybe they will .
it's an island , babe .
if you don't bring it here , you won't find it here .
oh , heavy .
pilot and philosopher .

thank you .
hello?
look , i know you're on vacation ... but this is a dire emergency .
oh , no .
the photo shoot's on ... but it's an availability nightmare .
vendela and evander holyfield only have a mutual 17 hour window .
if we don't get them now , nobody's available ... for four months and we lose them for the may cover .
well , there's gotta be somebody closer whose life you can screw up .
that's the ironic thing , dear .
there's not .
vendela's in sydney .
evander's in osaka .
i threw taylor on a plane this morning to papeete .
tahiti?
yes .
they're all coming to you .
all you have to do is fly back to tahiti ... baby sit the shoot , fly back out .
fifteen hours at the most .
look , this is complicated .
uh , frank proposed to me last night .
oh , my god !
this is so exciting .
sweetie , i'm so happy for you .
well , i'm glad , but ...
the point is , what kind of message am i sending to frank ... if the day after our betrothal , i'm leaving him to go on some photo shoot?
an excellent message .
this is the perfect opportunity to establish parameters .
oh , god .
i read somewhere ... that 38 . 6 % of all women ... are pressured into quitting their jobs in the first year of marriage .
marjorie , you read that in our magazine , and we made it up .
oh , please , robin , please .
please , please , robin , please?

oh , good !
do you have a way back to tahiti?
oh , yeah , i can ...
that's good?

i i sort of have an emergency .
emergency?
what's going on?
well , my boss called me , and she wants me to go to tahiti tonight .
oh , well , i'm sort of on my layover here .
right .
uh , would $500 cut your layover short?
um , baby , want to go to papeete?
i can't .
i have a show tonight .
tuesday is tamure night .
uh , it's tamure night .
oh .
my hands are tied .
that's for later .
you know , i'm stuck .
i i i really ...
this is really important .
you'd be doing me a tremendous favour .
how would 700 be?
okay .
yeah?
yeah .
great .
i'll meet you at the plane in ...
give me an hour .
great .
thank you .
honey , it's a known fact that 38 . 6 % of all women ... are pressured into quitting their jobs the first year of marriage .
that was in your magazine .
you probably made it up .
if you had to work , i would understand .
that's because you're not as romantic as i am .
ohh .
so , come with me .
no .
how come?
because if i go with you , i'll resent the fact that i'm there .
if i stay here , i'll miss you , but you'll feel guilty .
i like that better .
come on .
it's only for one night , hubby .
say that again .
what , hubby?
i like that .
say it .
hubby .
ready to go .
is it safe to fly?
it is with me .
oh , you're that good , huh?
i'm the best you've ever been with .
i'm not sure i trust your equipment .
we may be old , but we're sturdy .
mm hmm .
what's all this?
hotel overstocks , local trinkets .
i was gonna fly 'em to tahiti tomorrow .
but with your job , i got a twofer .
oh , how handy for you .
excuse me .
i just want to keep this from flying at you .
there we go .
do you have my , uh , money?
oh .
yes .
thank you .
it's all there .
i trust you .
so what kind of work do you do , uh , back there in new york?
i'm an assistant editor for a magazine called dazzle .
dazzle?

thirty six victor , be advised ... ... southwestern ...

i'm sorry .
this weather came up quicker than anybody anticipated .

it's just not worth the risk .
uh , all right .
a line of squalls has got us boxed in .
tighten up your seat belt .
it's gonna get bumpy .
wha ...
uh .
y you don't don't mind if i just come sit up here with you?

that's ...
that's the best i can do for you .
whoa !
what happened?
it crumpled the landing gear when we hit .
well , aren't you gonna fix it?
i mean , can't we ... can't we reattach it somehow?
oh , sure .
we'll , like , glue it back on .
how's that?
aren't you one of those guys?
what guys?
those guy guys .
you know , those guys with skills .
skills?
yeah .
you send them out into the wilderness with a pocketknife and a q tip ... and they build you a shopping mall .
you can't do that?
no .
no , i can't do that .
but i can do this .
does that help?
i can get us out of here .

pronto .
right .

how do you want it?
excuse me?
do you want it sugar coated or right between the eyes?
you pick .
we've only got one wheel , so we can't take off .
lightning fried the radio and the emergency location transmitter .
air sea will probably try a rescue , but without a beacon to hone in ... it's like trying to find a flea on an elephant's ass .
the only thing we've got is ... this flare gun and a single flare .
is it too late to get it sugar coated?
that was sugar coated .
well , then , what's the bad news?
the bad news is we may be here for a long time .
you and me .
for a long , long ...
long , long , long , long time .

what's this?
it's a boat .
it's a life raft .
we can use that to get off the island .
where are you gonna go?
you don't even know where you are .
last thing you wanna do is go bouncing around the ocean ... in an eight foot blowup boat .
don't tell me what i want !

oh , good .
why?

yeah .

some sort of creature has just swum up my pants .
i'm guessing ...
i'm guessing a snake .
oh .
that's bad .
so , uh , what do i do?
i mean , i could reach down and , and grab it .
no , that ... that could be risky .
it might be poisonous .
well , right .
but on the other hand , if it's poisonous and will bite me ... do i want to allow it to continue to swim around in my shorts?
all good questions .
would you just give me some advice?
all right?
just advice , input , anything .
just give it to me .
i'm very open at this particular juncture , all right?

you've crashed half the time !
and there is nothing wrong with my tits !
there's so much water .
don't worry .
wherever they are , quinny is going to take good care of your girlfriend .
what do you mean by that?
come on , let's pick up the pace a little .
i want to get to the top before dark .

we better find the beacon .
this way .
that beacon better be up there .
look , the storm blew us southwest 40 minutes .
good chance this is tamitange .
ah , tamitange .
well , that explains everything .
there's a radio navigation beacon on the top of tamitange .
we find it .
we shut it down .
they come out and fix it .
we're rescued .
it took 'em two years to fix the streetlight outside my apartment .
wow .
oh , wow .
wow , this is beautiful .
well?
so , where's the beacon?
huh?
well ...
oh , let me see .
well , it's this one , right?
tamitange , the one with the funny shaped peninsula to the north , right?
yeah .
well , tha ... that's north , right?
right?
uh huh .
yeah .
there's no peninsula .
who stole the peninsula?
no .
this isn't tamitange?
so there is no beacon that we're gonna turn off ... and they're gonna come fix it and find us?
well , well , we could be , um ...
we could be further to the south .
this could be mata nui .
and what's on mata nui?
us .
what?
what do i want ...
what are you doing?
son of a bitch !
goddam it !
uh , please don't do that again .

come on .
ever since we've been here , you've been so confident .
you have all the answers .
well , i'm the captain .
that's my job .
it's no good for me to go waving my arms in the air ... and screaming , " oh , shit , we're gonna die .
that doesn't evoke much confidence , does it?
no , no , that does not .
i need you to be my confident captain .
i can't tell you how difficult this is gonna be for me if you lose it .
