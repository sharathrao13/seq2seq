we'll never get everyone down in time .

we all went through a lot to get here jack .
the ladder's broken .
you gonna lower people down there one by one?

what did she say?
she said she has to dance at her wedding .
ok , no one is out there , no one is coming .
but the but the frenchwoman said
the frenchwoman is missing a bloody wingnut , you know , i mean it was all bollocks , it's a ghost story , she set the fire herself .
what?
nothing .
has anyone seen vincent?
the dog .
anyone seen him?
has anyone seen the dog?
where are you going?
i lost the damn dog .
why'd you do that?
why'd you light the fuse man?
why wouldn't i light the fuse?
ahh , maybe because i was running towards you , waving my arms , yelling " don't do that !
well you got a point there .
i guess i was just excited to get inside , i mean , that's why we came here isn't it?
that's why we went all the way out to the black rock , and why we got the dynamite to blow the hatch .
we did it so that we could get inside hugo .
and to save everybody's lives .
and to save everyone's lives .
or , maybe it was just our destiny , right john?
maybe .
guys?
ah , it's the hatch door , you'd better see this .
vincent !
this is not a good idea .
i saw him 5 minutes ago .
besides , you're the one who said there wasn't anyone out here .
i said we didn't see anyone .
the dog will come back on his own , he always does .
watching that dog was the one thing anybody ever asked me to do .
something happens to him ...
when was the last time you slept or had something to eat?
you're exhausted !
i can't tell that kid i lost his dog because i was exhausted .
i'll circle around behind him .
ok
vincent !
sayid !
sayid !
where are you !?
sayid !
sayid !
shannon
walt?
shhh
what are you doing here?
shannon !
what is it?
what?
why do you wanna get down there so bad?
ly .
why do i wanna get down there so bad ly?
jack thinks i'm crazy doesn't he?
why , because you wanna drop into a hatch that's been locked from the inside , by a foot thick steel door that says quarantine?
well look at the bright side , damage is done .
bright side?
and if jack thinks i've lost it , i can't blame him really ...
then again , 5 hours ago i was pulled into a hole by what appeared to be a column of black smoke .
did you see it kate?
then i guess we're both crazy !
wonder what jack thinks he saw?
you should go ahead man , don't want locke making time with your girl .
joke dude .
i'm not really in the mood hurley .
really?
wow !
usually you're like mr ha ha .
there you go .
life's not so bad , right?
i mean , sure the others are coming to like , eat us all , and every once in a while someone blows up all over you but , you do get to sleep in every morning .
uh huh , and the numbers?
what?
the numbers are bad " that's what you were yelling right when i tackled you .
yeah it's kind of a long story .
i got time .
you'll think i'm crazy .
try me .
a while ago , i was in this kinda psych ward , and there was this guy leonard , and all the time i knew him all he ever said were these numbers .
4 , 8 , 15, 16 , 23 , 42 .
over and over and over again .
and they kinda got stuck in my head .
so when i got out , well actually a couple of months after i got out , i was buying a frozen burrito , and i thought " hey i should play the lottery " .
and i guess those numbers were still stuck in my head , so i played them .
and i won , 114 million dollars .
that's when it started happening .
my grandpa died , my house caught on fire , the chicken joint i worked at got hit by a meteor , well , actually meteorite .
ok , so tonight , i see the same friggin 'numbers on that hatch thing .
just written on the side , and that's why i tried to stop it , because that thing is cursed man .
you were in a psych ward?
i'm not crazy .
i'm not saying you are .
so , what that's it , that's all?
what do you want me to say?
how about you believe me man !
hurly , they're numbers .
what that thing where doctors make you feel better just by talking to you?
bedside manner .
yeah that , yours sucks dude !
what happened to him?
you just try to relax ok?
the car that i hit , the other driver was older .
he died in the e. r.
i can't feel anything .
i know .
what's happened to me?
you have a fracture dislocation of your thorasic lumbar spine , with multiple crushed vertibrae .
your back is broken .
your spleen is ruptured and bleeding into your abdomen , and that has to be stopped .
i'm gonna perform surgery and repair as much damage as possible , but even the most optimistic result puts the likelyhood of retaining any feeling or mobility anywhere below the waist at , extremely unlikely .
oh .
doctor shepard , may i have a word please?
so?
what i do wrong?
you did something wrong?
you're frowning .
my face is always this way .
dad , hey come on !
let's hear it .
you might wanna try handing out some hope every once in a while .
even if there's a 99 % probability that they're utterly , hopelessly screwed , folks are much more inclined to hear that 1 % chance , that things are gonna be ok .
her spine's crushed , i tell her that everything's gonna be ok , that's false hope dad .
look , maybe , maybe , but it's still , hope .
i know what i saw .
it was him , it was walt !
shannon , please lower your voice you'll upset the rest of the
i heard whispers .
where?
everywhere .
what , what whispers?
i don't know , them !
do you think something happened to the raft?
nothing happened to the raft , walt is with your husband , with
sayid , i know what i saw !
they're back .
ahh ...
locke found a , a hatch in the ground , 'bout a half a mile from here .
we left to , to blow it open so that we could hide inside .
so , all of us could hide inside , in case ...
but , that doesn't matter now because that's not gonna work , there's no way for all of us to get down in there tonight .
jack?
where's doctor artz?
ahh , he didn't make it .
did you see them?
did you see the others?
hey !
shannon !
there are no others , we already had this conversation .
what the hell would you know about it?
hey !
everything's gonna be ok , let's just , lets take it easy , we're gonna be alright .
we're gonna stay here tonight , ok , together , we've still got 4 guns , we'll put lookouts at all the entrances .
we're all gonna be safe as long as we stay together .
the sun comes up in 3 hours and we're all gonna be here to see that happen .
i promise .
john , what are you doing?
i'm getting some cable .
what for?
it's for the hatch , i'm going in .
you really think that's the smartest thing to do right now john?
i doubt it , in fact you're right , the safest thing is to stay here , wait for morning , wait for these others to see if they ever show up ...
wait for the brave folks on the raft to bring help , but me , i'm tired of waiting .
so do you believe it?
believe what?
that everything's gonna be ok .
yeah , i do .
kind of unlike you , the whole glass half full thing .
there's a glass?
you did a good thing , saying what you said .
you're taking care of everybody ...
just giving them something to count on .
if you weren't here jack ...
i'm going to the hatch .
i understand why you can't go , they need you here , i get it , i do , but locke's going into that thing whether you like it or not .
and if he falls and breaks his neck ...
live together die alone right?
right .
your fiance was seriously injured , could take as long as 10 , maybe 12 hours .
i won't know how extensive the damage is until i get inside .
she was going for a dress fitting and to look at , tablecloths .
when is it?
the wedding .
oh , it's , 8 months .
well , i'm sure sarah will have recovered by then
recovered?
umm , what does that mean?
there will be ongoing physical therapy , but if she works really hard
w .. w .. will we be able to uhh ... you know ... make love?
you need to know that there's a chance sarah might very well need professional care for the rest of her life .
what , like she won't be able to go to the bathroom by herself?
come here .
come here .
i wanna tell you a little secret .
come on .
closer .
it's ok , i know i'm not gonna be dancing anymore .
i can still roll around at my wedding .
you're invited ok?
i'm gonna fix you !
expected to find you halfway down there by now .
i was waiting for you .
so you want me to go down first?
hell , you're lighter .
i can belay you down and , bring you back up just as easy .
the shaft might get narrower down there too .
you left out the part where you just want to see if i get eaten by something .
yeah well , that too .
not too tight?
i got it .
ok .
wait , what do i say if i need to stop?

i told her ...
i made a promise i couldn't keep .
i told her i'd fix her and ...
i couldn't .
failed .
well , right .
just one thing ...
what if you did fix her?
i didn't .
but what if you did?
you don't know what you're talking about man .
