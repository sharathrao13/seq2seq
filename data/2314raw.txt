an impressive sight , general pershing .
that's the kind of muscle we need to stop these damn raids .
i don't have muscle ... but i have speed , that's the reason for the train .
luck ... and a little information .
i'll find cordoba .
8 to 5 they don't get that gun up in one try .
you're on .
you lose , soldier .
you're going to help them .
all of you .
on your feet .
move .
clay , i've got something here .
an insect , probably .
slide some whisky in that ear , you'll be alright .
i'm giving you a direct order .
my men aren't under your orders .
they're in the u. s. army and they'll obey orders .
they'll do what i tell them .
and i say they don't drill ... they don't work , they don't salute .
they just fight .
jackson , adam .
six field pieces , general .
m 1902 , 3 inch , pivot traverse , panorama sighting .
enough fire power to blow a town apart .
six guns .
i want them .
i want to know where they will be ... how they are guarded , and by whom .
i want those guns .
alright , we'll split up here .
cordoba's looking for recruits .
we'll ride in separate .
adam , keep your mouth shut .
your brother won't be there to look after you .
i'll make you a bet .
i reach cordoba before you do .
don't bet with me , boy .
you don't know enough to tie your sweatband .
don't get your foot caught in a bucket .
not unless it's filled with beer .
get the hell out of here .
adios , amigo " .
he's young , but he'll settle down .
how far?
six feet?
excellent , huh , svedborg?
we can use them .
where did you find them , pistolero?
a texas labour gang .
we figured we could join your revolution .
we brought you as many men as we could .
remember , hombres ... it's better to die on your feet ... than live on your knees .
he's softening , general .
i think he's about to break .
you have a musical ear , svedborg .
a perfect pitch for human weakness ... but you enjoy it too much .
adam ...
my god , it's your brother .
i am general cordoba .
listen to me .
we know about pershing's train and the guns ... but , where is it going?
they'll kill him .
that's right .
what are we going to do , just stand and watch?
that's right .
you son of a bitch .
where is the train?
where is the train?
springs ...
harmon springs .
when will it arrive?
tuesday night .
correct , general .
that is what our friend says .
the revolution has many friends , for a price .
kill him .
the revolution has many friends ... for a price .
general pershing .
fred tate , mayor of harmon springs .
tate .
please .
that's a hell of a sight ... all those cannons .
but will they stop those damn greasers raiding us?
no , mayor tate , i will .
do we get a detachment of cavalry?
not likely .
then you're selling a lot of bull .
look , this is an election year ...
fred .
you know i used to run 80 000 acres of range across the border ... before i got raided out?
i want those bastards cured , right?
right , and the way to do it is to get soldiers along the border .
the army doesn't have enough men to watch 1200 miles of border .
that is why we need you .
don't be polite , general .
i'll tell him .
the senator asked me to set this up , so this is the way it'll be .
you'll raise an auxiliary and patrol your own section of border .
any raid , you yell , and the army comes in and mops up .
and if they don't come?
don't sell the army short .
you execute your part of the plan , we'll do the rest .
high .
your play .
watch the machine guns , forward , back .
i'll get to pershing .
slow him down .
we have some time .
why don't we find some amusement?
thanks , pal .
texas .
here .
thanks , sport .
not me , him .
i'm in no hurry .
i'll fix that , honey .
we'll have fun .
well , i smell a little ripe ...
you said it , honey .
i didn't .
we can forget it .
i don't want to make you throw up .
hey , honey .
i got paid .
i'm a professional .
don't you worry , we'll be just fine .
don't be too long .
ruby !
yes , sir .
what buffalo pit did he come out of?
that'll cover it .
come on , big man .
wait a minute .
wait a minute .
wait , wait a minute .
stop making such a fuss .
it'll be just as good when you're clean .
listen , we don't do laundry here .
you get a bath after you're stripped .
do you know anything about pistols?
enough to know all you have to do is pull the trigger .
you washed there already .
i'll wash down here then .
better?
don't you think it's time to rinse me off?
i think so .
there you go .
what a specimen you are .
i think you're clean now .
out you get .
thank you .
just a second .
one second .
just ... just ...
now , i've got to go out for a minute .
you get the rest when i come back , ok?
honey , we were just getting started .
well ... maybe later .
douglas .
gently , captain , soft and gentle .
cordoba's in town with a small army .
what?
he came to get our cannon .
why didn't you warn us earlier?
they're watching , the town's full of them .
tell the general cordoba will set off an explosion as a distraction .
he's going to hit from the rear .
with a mob of bandits?
with trained light cavalry .
he's counting on surprise .
you can chop him up like sausage .
be ready .
hey now , you're touchy , captain .
and you're off limits .
i just wander and play my music .
no law against that .
then wander in another direction .
yes , sir .
you play an excellent game of chess .
i don't get the chance too often .
i have enjoyed it .
we aim to please .
are you a soldier?
i like to think so .
now .
evening , ladies .
ready , honey?
those things are too sharp .
i can't stay .
where are you going?
outside .
outside?
what's the matter?
don't you like me?
yeah .
it's just something that runs in my family .
you never can tell .
no questions .
no resistance .
get that ammunition out !
fire brigade !
get the machine guns set up in a crossfire pattern .
yes , sir .
keep it up !
jackson .
why don't they use the machine guns?
cordoba's got them .
long live general cordoba !
let's go .
where have you been?
general , we lost the train .
let's go .
viva cordoba !  viva !
32 men killed , 26 men wounded .
and six artillery pieces lost to those damn bandits ... plus a personal attack on myself and making jackasses out of the army .
your pride might be wounded , but i lost eight good men .
don't be insolent .
your mission was to learn of cordoba's plans ... we got no warning .
the fault is clearly yours .
yes , i made a major tactical error , i relied on captain riggs .
riggs was a fine officer .
he got himself decoyed and butchered .
that'll do , captain .
let's get on with the tactical plans .
how accurate is this model of cordoba's fortress?
as accurate as the captain's report .
we never saw the place , but harkness and i ... got descriptions from cordoba .
it's here , in the mountains .
more than 200 miles in .
and that country's worse than rough .
i ran cattle down there for 12 years .
the roads are dust for nine months and mud for three .
get caught in the attack , mr. warner?
not too bad .
i just didn't duck quick enough .
general , the last 40 miles are all open country .
then there's not much chance of surprising cordoba .
no chance , i'd say .
it's his country , he's on a mountain top .
steep cliffs , one road .
with those cannons , he's the hero of every peon in northern mexico .
ready !
fire !
fire !
fire !
i want those guns destroyed .
i estimate one month to arrange supplies , transport ... diplomatic agreement .
an expeditionary force .
you can't go into mexico with the army .
why not?
a gringo invasion?
exactly .
they should be taught a lesson .
lessons , colonel , are taught in a classroom .
you are talking about killing people to prove a point .
those people will fight to prove a point .
i'm not interested in your opinions .
i'm interested in one thing : a solution .
yes , sir .
i want someone to get inside that fortress .
you mean me , sir?
you , and the men you need .
you'll be travelling out of uniform ... without authorisation ... without orders .
lf you're caught ... you'll be shot .
but i want those guns destroyed .
i want cordoba .
and i want him alive .
at ease , lieutenant .
captain douglas ... this is lieutenant gutierrez , liaison from the government of mexico .
lieutenant .
i'm assigning him to your unit .
what?
my orders are to bring the traitor cordoba to mexico city for trial .
i'll try for the guns , i'll even try for cordoba ... but i'm not carrying him .
i was assured full co operation .
nada personal , teniente .
llevar slamente mis hombres .
i speak excellent english .
good , then you understand .
you don't go .
that's your decision .
thank you , sir .
don't thank me , i'm not indulging you .
i'm gambling your life .
yes , sir .
the cannons , right?
and cordoba .
you volunteered .
fine .
anyway you look at it , you're a dead man .
pick your time .
i will .
look at that , busted clear off .
i'm completed the calculations .
the guard will change in three minutes .
meanwhile , this man is the only one on duty .
so what?
i also determined this lock can be opened easily .
why don't you just give it a try , greek?
i have .
howdy , captain .
did you come with my pardon?
released in my custody , corporal .
released?
they just about killed me .
they didn't .
where are we going?
trouble .
next time i get you two in here ...
i'll strip you down and chain you to the bunks .
i've never stolen a bunk before .
200 miles into the sierra occidental?
long , weary trip .
are you declining , andy?
no .
i wouldn't miss this dance for nothing .
i enjoy watching you go into the jaws of death ... and come out with somebody's gold filling .
i'll get out .
i might just bring you out too .
with that guarantee , bring me along .
i will not go .
it's a people's revolution in mexico .
i won't help to put it down .
we won't attack the people .
we're going after one man , cordoba .
you want to help the people?
you know i do .
somebody's got to get cordoba .
that's what i'm going to do .
perhaps you're right .
now , to get him , we've got to isolate him .
i don't know , it sounds awful rough , cap .
maybe we ought to forget it .
you're gutless , andy .
no , i just want to live forever .
i'll send the medal to your mother .
gentlemen , may i present our mexican ally .
teniente " antonio gutierrez .
he's pretty .
he's kind of noisy though .
that's insolent .
you're talking to an officer of the mexican army .
there's no rank .
we're all equals , except for me , being a little more equal .
throw him out .
you need somebody to isolate cordoba .
i can provide that somebody .
who?
no , not unless i go along .
you're bluffing .
i don't trust you either .
the introductions will be inside mexico .
when?
where?
ln two days . ln madera , the casa de extraos .
we might stop by .
you're a stubborn man , lieutenant .
why?
once i was proud of my regiment .
it had honour .
now , it no longer exists because general hector cordoba ... betrayed it .
i will have payment for that betrayal ... even if i have to use you .
how far are we going to trust him?
jackson .
andy .
peter .
i want that ready by 5am .
i've got some reconnaissance in town .
there's a fellow i want to see .
very attractive , darling .
thank you so much , darling .
don't knock my accent , rod .
it's my only talent .
honey , that is a shameful lie .
i don't know if i like that .
it makes me sound cheap .
i'm not .
when i choose a man , i'm faithful to him .
warner might not think that , when he finds out what you told me .
harry is sweet , and generous .
i've been absolutely faithful to him .
like i told you .
but i'm leaving this hole in the morning , so what the hell !
stop explaining .
you convinced me a long time ago .
there's still a couple of hours until morning .
and a couple of things i've got to check out .
i thought you loved me .
i do .
for your beauty ... your fire , your talent ...
and your first class cigars .
pilot paid 30 pieces of silver .
ls cordoba giving you 80 000 acres?
take my advice .
never trust a lady .
company still with us?
no .
as soon as we left the main road they stopped tracking us .
four of them moved straight on .
they're waiting for us .
that means we ride into them .
and make sure we're the only ones that ride out the other side .
it's a good thing we've got mr. warner with us .
he knows all about everything , don't you , mr. warner?
i think mr. warner wants to say something .
i'll have you court martialled for this .
lf i'm wrong , you can .
what do you want?
just the pleasure of your company .
like i keep telling you , never trust a belly dancer .
what did you pay her?
nothing .
maybe she loves me .
we're about to find out .
peter , go round the back .
warner , your friends are expecting four of us .
you are number one .
there's an ambush up ahead , right behind that monastery .
don't shoot !
it's me !
don't shoot !
don't shoot !
don't shoot !
you get them all?
yeah .
bad?
no .
move your arm .
it'll do .
thanks for your concern .
anytime .
it should be cleaned first .
later .
jorge campo , a major in cordoba's army .
alright , let's go .
are you alright?
how's warner?
he's dead .
it's been one bitch of a day .
i'm sore down to the bone .
how are you feeling?
mean .
sorry .
jackson .
come cut this slug out of me .
why me?
because you've got a steady hand .
it's right here .
there?
that's right .
get on with it .
get on with it .
anything you say .
it's not so deep .
a nice neat job .
any time .
oh , boy .
this is what i call taking it soft .
first class genuine oak wood jerky , first class water ... and a 10 minute rest every 20 hours .
that's right , andy .
you get to ride drag , just as soon as you finish enjoying your dinner .
i surely do thank you .
a taste of water .
taste of dust from here on .
when i was a boy in greece , a man could live for a week on that ...
and another week on living rock .
why did you come here?
i came for the third week .
madera is just past those hills .
about 3 hours , i'd say .
we'll make it in two .
even if it kills us?
you say that with some feeling .
peter , set your watch at 1 . 15 .
mr. gutierrez , please?
23 .
a light , amigo?
who is it?
i'm very cautious .
where's your man?
here .
miss leonora cristobal , captain rod douglas .
am i satisfactory?
what's she got to do with cordoba?
he has a great weakness .
i know , for women .
leonora is a woman , and an attractive one .
you're volunteering for a job a whore might turn down .
i have my reasons .
well ... this job works by my reasons .
you don't fit into them .
you're an idiot .
captain douglas , listen .
i want cordoba dead .
i'll do what's necessary for that .
what's necessary is to let him make love to you .
do what he wants .
and make believe you enjoyed it .
why do you want to do that?
because ...
cordoba's bandits raided our hacienda .
he killed my father and my brother ... as i watched .
are you satisfied?
no .
women bury their dead and keep on living .
you're dodging .
why?
i know what it is to let him do what he wants with me .
he ... raped me ... and left me with my dead .
i want him killed .
we're not going to kill him .
what?
the government wants him tried publicly ... disgraced , not martyred .
but i swear to you , he will be executed .
we're going to try to blow the cannon and bring him out with us .
you'd have to distract him .
do you know what that means?
yes .
captain douglas , my family is dead .
i myself am also a little dead .
i want cordoba to pay for those deaths .
what's the connection between you two?
our families were friends .
alright .
i'll gamble a little .
try to keep cordoba entertained .
make a map of his personal quarters .
guards , doors , access .
go in early in the morning .
you've got that much time to reconsider .
my considering is done .
i'll be there tomorrow .
i'll arrive as an officer of cordoba's own regiment ... anxious to join him for excitement and loot .
you'll be thoroughly convincing .
leonora , are you set?
he didn't exaggerate .
i'll survive .
your captain douglas is well suited to cordoba .
with luck ... they'll kill each other .
it'll be a hell of a climb up that mountain .
i've been looking at it , i'm not enjoying the sight .
you two will enjoy it more about half way up .
lf andy and i can get to the gate , we'll welcome you in .
what about that lady?
it's a gamble .
lf she can hook cordoba , fine .
lf not , we'll do it the hard way .
ln any case , we'll stick to plans .
climbing equipment?
yes .
explosives?
dynamite .
two fuses , slow and fast .
flares?
it'll be a hot party .
right .
get rid of the horses , and bury the gear .
halt .
whoa .
where are you going?
i wish to see general cordoba .
and who are you?
lieutenant antonio gutierrez , a deserter .
so?
so , i followed your example , but more discreetly .
i found myself trained , skilled , and bored .
ln mexico city they said you'll own half of northern mexico .
i am a greedy man .
a greedy man .
a touching story .
i joined forces with lieutenant gutierrez ... for my own reasons .
yes , i remember now .
from a hacienda outside madera , cristobal .
you remember?
leonora cristobal .
seorita cristobal , how could i forget?
i couldn't forget either .
the way you took me ...
no man had ever touched me before .
so , you come back to me in friendship?
yes .
and how shall i welcome you?
with gratitude , i hope .
for what?
for the love of a woman?
for information .
this man is antonio gutierrez ... sent here by the mexican government to capture you .
with him , are four yankee soldiers commanded by captain douglas .
what have you done?
i'll kill you !
excuse me , i forgot to introduce major svedborg .
he's a first class cavalry officer .
and a sadist .
which is why he had to leave sweden to join me .
i overlook cruelty in exchange for ... efficiency ...
and loyalty .
well , well , well .
look who's here ... dragging his tail back and only a week late .
i got cut off , i had to walk .
you mean you ran off .
then you heard we had the guns ... so you came back to join the revolution .
who is he?
i don't know .
i met him on the road .
another volunteer .
how do?
texas .
where have you been?
i got cut off during the raid .
i got wounded , had to walk back .
where?
ln the shoulder .
that's a fresh wound , texas .
keep him under guard until i get back .
him too .
take their guns .
keep them under guard .
stand over there .
we have heard there are yankee spies nearby .
they want to destroy the revolution , everything you've worked for .
we must find them .
five men will search the base of the mountain .
the rest , straight out .
we want them alive , if possible .
let's go .
come on , move it !
go on , quickly !
leonora !
this won't do you any good !
you betrayed douglas and his men !
but there'll be others !
lf she looks this way , we're snake bit .
she seems to be occupied for the moment .
this captain douglas , what was his plan?
i was to make love to you , distract you ... to give them time to destroy the guns and then take you .
i would think you'd hate me .
you ripped me apart and went away .
and i hated you .
but you took me .
and you still have me .
your story better hold up , or ...
we looked everywhere .
no trace of anyone .
provision a patrol .
search everything half a day's ride out .
lf svedborg takes us to cordoba , that bitch will be right there .
when they stop looking at you , get lost .
i've got to see our friend antonio .
ln the cooler?
i'll try .
get me out later tonight , 9 . 30 .
i'll get you out .
how the hell will you get in?
the hard way .
sergeant ortega .
ortega !
it's over , boys .
you afraid?
no .
i've got other things on my mind .
why?
i don't know .
i think it's the night .
it reminds me of the darkness of a grave .
antonio?
where are you?
over here .
you're easy to find .
leonora betrayed me .
how much did she tell?
everything .
come on , give me a hand .
two things you should never do with a woman ... argue with them , and trust them .
get a piece of paper and make me a map of cordoba's rooms .
cordoba uses the old chapel as his office .
his private quarters are next to the cloister in the old dining hall .
rear entrance?
no .
it backs on the cliff .
the only way in is through the chapel .
that means over the roof .
ls that the entrance?
yes .
charming , isn't it?
peasant work .
crude , but reverent .
this was the father superior's room .
i took it for my own .
how pious of you .
the peasants are superstitious .
i use their superstition .
i use whatever comes ... to hand .
what's up?
nothing .
hey ...
i've orders to bring the prisoner to the general .
let's go .
howdy , captain .
what time is it?
nine thirty .
do as he says .
i'll see you at the stables .
buenas noches " , lieutenant .
i brought you a uniform .
undress him .
come on .
have you authorised the removal of the officer from the guardhouse?
no .
one of the guards and a sergeant went to take him to the general .
curious .
i'll speak to the general .
colonel , the general requested privacy for tonight .
check the guardhouse .
wait there .
where is the general?
who is it?
your tea , general .
go away .
your tea , general .
it's ready .
it's ready , general .
general?
back off .
general , may i introduce captain douglas , the man i told you about .
i know you talked , but you got him alone .
that's all i wanted .
bitch .
it's a shame .
what?
these guns have beautiful mechanisms .
you've got a mechanic's soul .
i like machines , they can be trusted .
not like people .
some people can be trusted .
yeah , some .
know what this is?
a flare gun .
right .
burst of smoke , burst of fire .
we'll put a shell into everything that'll burn .
ammo here , explosives here ... stored hay .
got it?
yeah .
sure?
i'm a trained officer .
so far , all i've seen you do is fall over your own feet .
your insolence ...
now , look here .
lf you want to play soldier with me , prove you can hold up your end .
i'll prove anything you like .
attaboy .
let's get moving .
4 minutes .
she's set .
go ahead .
that's it , get the door open .
ain't that pretty?
that's it .
keep moving .
meet at the stables in 10 minutes .
guard the guns !
what is she doing here?
i missed her .
come on .
all present and accounted for .
ls she coming along?
lf you don't mind .
i never minded a pretty woman in my whole entire life .
when are we going?
the boys will tell us .
where's pete?
he didn't make it .
bring cordoba and the girl .
ready .
andy .
you bastard .
andy !
we'll rest the horses here .
i told you once , my place , my time .
now .
he was my brother .
and you let him die .
i'm sorry your brother got killed .
well ...
jack , i've known you a long time .
lf it'll make you feel better , pull the trigger ... but don't look from any help from me .
you bastard !
jackson .
he was shot from behind by one of his own men .
he's been dead since we left the fortress .
the general's not going to like that .
why not?
you destroyed the guns , cordoba is dead ...
you'll be a hero .
the trouble with being a hero is the morning after .
let's bury him .
