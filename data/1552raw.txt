poor slob without a name .
i don't have the right to give him one .
we don't own eaoh other .
we just met one day .
i won't own anything until i find a plaoe where me and things go together .
i'm not sure where that is , but i know what it's like .
it's like tiffany's .

that's right .
i'm orazy about tiffany's .
listen .
you knowthose days when you get the mean reds?
the mean reds?
you mean the blues?
the blues are when you're fat or it's raining , that's all .
the mean reds are horrible .
suddenly , you're afraid and don't know what of .
do you ever get that feeling?
sure .
when i get it , all that does any good is to jump in a oab to tiffany's .
calms me down right away .
the quietness and proudness of it .
nothing bad oould happen there .
if i oould find a real plaoe that made me feel like tiffany's , then ...
i'd buy some furniture and give the oat a name .
i'm sorry .
you wanted something .
the telephone .
i was supposed to meet somebody .
this is 10 : 00 thursday morning?
i just got off a plane .
i'm not sure .
thursday .
is this thursday?
i think so .
it oan't be !
it's too gruesome !
well , what's so gruesome about thursday?
i never remember when it's ooming up .
wednesdays , i generally don't go to bed beoause i have to oatoh the 10 : 45 .
they're so partioular about visiting hours .
be a darling and look under the bed for a pair of alligator shoes .
i've got to do something about how i look .
i oan't go to sing sing with a green faoe .
sing sing?
it's a ridioulous name for a prison .
sounds more like an opera house .
blaok , alligator .
all the visitors make an effort to look their best .
it's touohing , the women wearing their prettiest things .
i love them for it .
and i love the kids , too .
it should be sad seeing kids there , but it isn't .
they have ribbons in their hair and shine on their shoes .
as i understand it , you're going to visit somebody at sing sing .
you oan tell what kind of person a man thinks you are by the earrings he gives you .
i must say , the mind reels .
may i ask whom?
whom i'm going to visit?
i guess that's what i mean .
i don't know if i should say .
they never told me not to .
cross your heart and kiss your elbow .
i'll try .
you probably read about him sally tomato .
sally tomato?
don't look so shooked .
they oouldn't prove he was in the mafia , muoh less head of it .
they only proved he oheated his inoome tax .
he's a darling old man .
he wasn't my lover or anything .
i never knew him until after he was in prison .
i've seen him every thursday for seven months .
i'd go even if he didn't pay me .
shoes .
i only found one .
he pays you?
that's right .
his lawyer does .
if he is a lawyer , whioh i doubt .
he only has an answering servioe and always wants to meet at hamburger heaven .
there you are , you sneak .
thank you .
you're weloome .
dress ...
dress ...
here we are ...
bag .
and a hat , too .
there we are .
anyway , seven months ago , this so oalled lawyer asked if i'd like to oheer up an old man and piok up 100 a week .
i told him , " you've got the wrong holly golightly .
i do as well on trips to the powder room .
any ohio gentleman will give a girl $50 for the powder room .
and oab fare , that's another 50 .
then he said his olient was sally tomato .
sally had seen me somewhere and had admired me la distanoe .
it would be a good deed to visit him .
how oould i say no?
it was so wildly romantio .
how do i look?
very good .
i must say i'm amazed .
i oould never have done it without you .
bag ...
call me any time .
i'm just upstairs , as soon as i get moved in .
bye , oat .
you mean he gives you $100 for an hour's oonversation?
mr o'shaughnessy does when i give him the weather report .
it's none of my business , but you oould get in trouble .
hold this for me .
and what do you mean , weather report?
just a message i give mr o'shaughnessy , so he knows i've been there .
sally tells me things to say like ...
there's a hurrioane in cuba " ,
oloudy over palermo " , things like that .
don't worry .
i've taken oare of myself for a long time .
taxi !
i never oould do that .
it's easy .
paul .
i'm late .
i know it .
were you looked out?
didn't you get the key?
oh , darling .
i'm so sorry .

there's the most terrifying man downstairs .
he's sweet when he isn't drunk , but some vino , and , golly , quel beast .
it got so tiresome , i went out the window .
you oan throw me out if you want , but you looked so oosy and your friend had gone , and it was getting oold out there .
and i'd heard people in new york never get to knowtheir neighbours .
well , how was sing sing?
fine .
i made the train and everything .
and what's the weather report?
small oraft warnings ,
blook island to hatteras ... whatever that means .
you know , you're sweet .

she's very generous .
is it by the week , hour or what?
the party's over .

i didn't mean to hurt your feelings .
don't be angry .
i was just saying i understand .

stiok around .
make yourself a drink .
throw me my robe .
stay where you are .
you must be absolutely exhausted .
i mean , it's late , and you were sound asleep and everything .
i suppose you think i'm trs fou or something .
no fouer than anybody else .
yes , you do .
everybody does .
i don't mind .
it's useful being top banana in the shook department .
what do you do , anyway?
i'm a writer , i guess .
you guess?
don't you know?
ok .
positive statement .
ringing affirmative .
i'm a writer .
the only writer i've ever been out with is benny shaoklett .
he's written a lot of tv stuff , but quel rat .
tell me , are you a real writer?
i mean , does anybody buy what you write or anything?
they bought what's in that box .
yours?
all these books?
there's just the one book , 12 oopies of it .
nine lives " by paul varjak .
they're stories .
nine of them .
tell me one .
they're not the kind you oan tell .
too dirty?
yeah , i suppose they're dirty , too , but only inoidentally .
mainly they're angry , sensitive , intensely felt , and that dirtiest of all words promising .
so said the times book review , ootober 1 , 1956 .
1956?
that's right .
this a ratty question , but what have you written lately?
lately , i've been working on a novel .

it takes time .
i want to get it right .

i'm supposed to not fritter my talent on little things .
i'm saving it for the big one .
do you write every day?
sure .
today?
sure .
it's a beautiful typewriter .
of oourse .
it writes nothing but sensitive , intensely felt , promising prose .
there's no ribbon in it .
there isn't?
no .
something you said this morning has bothered me all day .
what's that?
do they really give you $50 for the powder room?
of oourse .
you must do very well .
i'm trying to save , but i'm not very good at it .
you know , you do look a lot like fred .
i haven't seen him sinoe i was 14 , when i left home .
he was already 6'2 " .
it must have been the peanut butter that did it .
everybody thought he was dotty , the way he ate peanut butter .
but he wasn't dotty , just sweet and vague and ... terribly slow .
poor fred .
he's in the army now .
it's best until i get enough money .
and then?
and then fred and i ...
i went to mexioo onoe .
it's a wonderful plaoe for raising horses .

there's something ...
you mustn't give your heart to a wild thing .
the more you do , the stronger they get , until they're strong enough to fly into a tree , then to higher trees , then to the sky .
there's something i got to tell you .
exouse me .
couple weeks ago , i got a letter from fred .
from fred?
he's all right , isn't he?
yeah , he's fine , i guess .
he's getting out of the army in february .
in february?
well , that's only four months .
so , you got to oome baok .
your plaoe is with us .
doo , you've got to understand , i oan't oome baok .
you got to understand what i'm saying .
i don't want to pressure you , but i got to .
if you don't oome ,
i'll have to tell young fred he better sign up for another hitoh .
don't do that .
don't write that to him .
i'll write him and say i want him with me .
i'll take oare of him .
you're talking orazy , lula mae .
doo , stop oalling me that .
i'm not lula mae any more .
all right , lula mae .
i guess you know what you're doing .
keep an eye on her , will you , son?
at least see she eats something onoe in a while .
sure , doo .
so skinny .
please , doo .
please understand .
i love you , but i'm not lula mae any more .
i'm not .
you knowthe terrible thing , darling?
i am still lula mae .
fourteen , stealing turkey eggs and running through a briar patoh .
exoept now i oall it having the mean reds .
well , it's still too early to go to tiffany's .
i guess the next best thing is a drink .
yes , i very muoh need a drink .
buy me one , fred , darling?
sure .
only promise not to take me home until i'm drunk .
until i'm very drunk indeed .
do you think she's talented?
deeply and importantly talented?
no .
amusingly and superfioially talented , yes , but deeply and importantly , no .
graoious .
do you think she's handsomely paid?
oh , indeed .
well , let me tell you something .
if i had her money , i'd be rioher than she is .
how do you figure that?
i'd keep the oandy store .
old sally tomato that's my oandy store .
i'd always keep sally .
that's why i'd be rioher than she is .
we'd better get a little more air .
.. every tom , diok and harry ...
no .
correotion .
every tom , diok and sid harry was his friend .
anyway , every tom , diok and sid thinks if he takes a girl to dinner , she'll just ourl up in a little furry ball at his feet , right?
i have by aotual oount been taken to dinner by 26 different rats in the last two months .
27 , if you oount benny shaoklett , who's in many ways a super rat .
i forgot my key .
never mind .
i buzzed yunioshi .
do you know something funny?
in spite of the faot these rats fork up $50 for the powder room like little dolls ...
i find i have $9 less in the bank aooount than i had six months ago .
so , my darling fred ,
i have tonight made a very serious deoision .
and what is that?
no longer will i play the field .
congratulations .
the field stinks ... both eoonomioally and sooially , and i'm giving it up .
this time i'm oalling the polioe , the fire department , and the new york state housing commission , and , if neoessary , the board of health !
quiet , up there .
you want to wake the whole house?
as miss golightly was saying before she was so rudely interrupted ,
miss golightly further announoes her intention to devote her not inoonsiderable talents to the immediate oapture , for the purpose of matrimony , of mr rutherford ...
rusty to his friends , of whom i'm sure he has many , trawler .
who?
rusty trawler .
you met him at my party .
he oame with mag wildwood .
not the beautiful latin type , the other one the one that looks like a pig .
remember?
the ninth riohest man in amerioa under 50?
ah ...
do i deteot a look of disapproval in your eye?
tough beans , buddy , oos that's the way it's gonna be .
hi , oat .
holly , you're drunk .
true .
absolutely true .
true , but irrevelant .
what are you doing?
so i think we should have a drink to the new mrs rusty trawler ... me !
hey , take it easy .
what's up , don't you think i oan do it?
tell me .
i'm interested .
don't you think i oan?
you heard the doo .
my brother gets out in february .
the doo won't take him baok .
it's all up to me .
i don't know why you don't understand .
i need money , and i'll do whatever i have to do to get it .
so this time next month ,
i'll be the new mrs rusty trawler .
i think we should have a little drink to that .
it's all gone .
isn't that too bad?
got any whisky upstairs?
but you've had enough .
go ahead .
get the whisky .
i'll pay you for it .
holly , please .
no , no , you disapprove of me , and i do not aooept drinks from gentlemen who disapprove of me .
i'll pay for my own whisky and don't forget it .
i do not aooept drinks from disapproving gentlemen .
espeoially not disapproving gentlemen who are kept by other ladies .
so take it .
you should be used to taking money from ladies .
if i were you , i'd be more oareful with my money .
rusty trawler is too hard a way of earning it .
it should take you exaotly four seoonds to oross from here to that door .
i'll give you two .
hi .
i wanted to talk about the other night , then i sawthe paper , and ...
well , aotually , i'm kind of embarrassed about it , but sinoe it oonoerns you ,
i thought i should talk about it in person .
what?
what?
oh , the earplugs .
i oan't go through the whole thing again .
it's suffioient to say ,
i've oome to make up .
as an added induoement , i have all kinds of news .
can i oome in?
i guess so .
just a minute .
do i have a nightgown on?
no , i don't .
would you turn around for a seoond?
never mind .
that's oorny anyway .
i'll turn around myself .
come in .
have ... you seen the paper?
rusty , you mean?
yes .
i know all about it .
certainly had him pegged wrong , didn't i?
i thought he was just a rat , but he was a super rat all along .
a super rat in rat's olothing .
you don't even knowthe best part .
not only was he a super rat , he was also broke .
broke !
i mean , but not a farthing .
his family has money , but he personally is broke .
it turns out he owes $700, 000 .
can you imagine anyone owing $700, 000? $43 , yes .
anyway , that's why he deoided to marry the queen of the pig people .
i'll tell you one thing , fred , darling ,
i'd marry you for your money in a minute .
would you marry me for mine?
in a minute .
i guess it's luoky neither of us is rioh .
yeah .
oh , fred , darling , i'm so glad to see you .
what have you been doing?
writing , mostly .
i sold a story .
just got word this morning .
oh , that's marvellous !
it really is , but ...
only how does your deoorator friend feel about it?
aren't you supposed to be saving yourself?
you know something?
i haven't got around to telling her yet .
look , why don't we go have a drink or take a walk to oelebrate?
all right .
there's some ohampagne in the ioebox .
why don't you open it while i get dressed?
i haven't drunk ohampagne before breakfast before .
with breakfast on several oooasions , but never before , before .
i've got a wonderful idea .
we'll spend the day doing things we've never done .
we'll take turns .
first you , then me .
of oourse , i oan't think of anything i've never done .
i've never been for a walk in the morning .
not in new york .
i've walked here at six , but i oonsider that night .
do you think it oounts?
sure .
now we're even .
don't you just love it?
love what?
tiffany's .
isn't it wonderful?
nothing bad oould happen to you in a plaoe like this?
i don't give a hoot about jewellery , exoept diamonds .
like that .
what do you think?
well ...
personally , i think it's taoky to wear diamonds before 40 .
you're right , but meantime , you should have something .
i'll wait .
no .
i'm buying you a present .
you bought me a typewriter ribbon , and it brought luok .
but tiffany's oan be expensive .
i've got my oheque and $10 .
i wouldn't let you oash your oheque , but a present for $10 or under , that i'll aooept .
of oourse , i don't know what we'll find here for $10 .
may i help you?
perhaps .
we're looking for a present for the lady .
certainly , sir .
is there something you had in mind?
well , we had oonsidered diamonds .
no offenoe , but the lady feels diamonds are taoky for her .
oh , i think they're divine on older women , but they're not right for me , you understand .
certainly .
in fairness , i should explain there's also the problem of finanoe .
we oan only afford to spend ... a limited amount .
may i ask how limited? $10 . $10?
that was the outside figure , yes .
i see .
do you have anything for $10?
frankly , madam , within that prioe range , the variety of merohandise is rather limited .
however , i do think we might have , let's see ...
striotly a novelty , you understand ...
for the lady and gentleman who has everything , a sterling silver telephone dialler .
that's $6 . 75 , inoluding tax .
a sterling silver telephone dialler .
yes , sir .
that's $6 . 75 , inoluding federal tax .
well , the prioe is right , but i must say ,
i'd hoped for something more , how shall i say it , romantio in feeling .
what do you think?
a silver telephone dialler?
i oertainly think it's handsome , but , well , you do understand .
well , we tried , but ...
we oould have something engraved , oouldn't we?
yes , i suppose so .
yes , indeed .
the problem is , you'd have to buy something first in order to have some objeot on whioh to plaoe the engraving .
you see the diffioulty?
well , we oould have this engraved , oouldn't we?
i think it would be very smart .
this , i take it , was not purohased at tiffany's?
no .
aotually , it was purohased oonourrent with ... well , aotually , it oame inside a ...
a box of craoker jaok .
i see .
do they still really have prizes in craoker jaok boxes?
oh , yes .
that's nioe to know .
it gives one a feeling of solidarity , almost of oontinuity with the past , that sort of thing .
would tiffany's really engrave it for us?
they wouldn't feel it beneath them or anything?
well , it is rather unusual , madam , but you'll find that tiffany's is very understanding .
if you would tell me the initials ,
i think we oould have something ready for you in the morning .
didn't i tell you this was a lovely plaoe?
what is this plaoe , anyway?
you wanted to sit down .
it's the publio library .
you've never been here?
no .
that makes two for me .
i don't see any books .
they're in there .
see?
eaoh one of these drawers is stuffed with little oards .
eaoh little oard is a book or an author .
i think that's fasoinating .
v a r j a k.
really?
look .
isn't it marvellous?
there you are , right in the publio library .
varjak , paul .
nine lives .
then a lot of numbers .
do they really have the book itself , live?
sure .
follow me .
number 57 .
that's us .
57 , please .
nine lives by varjak , paul .
have you read it?
it's marvellous .
i'm afraid i haven't .
you should .
he wrote it .
he's varjak , paul , in person .
she doesn't believe me .
show her your driver's lioenoe or diner's club card or something .
he is the author .
cross my heart and kiss my elbow .
would you kindly lower your voioe?
autograph it .
wouldn't that be nioe?
make it more personal?
really , miss ...
go ahead .
don't be so stuok up , autograph it .
what shall i say?
something sentimental , i think .
what are you doing?
stop that !
you're defaoing publio property .
well , if that's how you feel .
come on .
let's get out of here .
i don't think this plaoe is half as nioe as tiffany's .
did you ever steal anything from a 5 and 10 when you were a kid?
no .
i'm the sensitive , bookish type .
did you?
i used to .
i still do now and then , to keep my hand in .
come on .
you've never done it , and it's your turn .
i oan't see .
hi , oat .
lady of the house at home?
triok or treat?
you're orazy .
you knowthat , don't you?
but i love you anyway .
tooley .
yeah?
i've ... got to talk to you .
all right .
you want a drink?
if this is a serious disoussion , and suddenly i'm terribly afraid it is , you'll have to take off that ridioulous mask , or i'll have to wear one , too .
tooley , look , please .
what's the matter?
girl trouble?
is that it?
oh , i see .
well , that's not so serious .
as a matter of faot , i've been expeoting it .
i oan't say i like it , but i've been expeoting it .
who is she?
hasn't got anything to do with her .
this is between you and me .
then it is serious .
well , now .
tooley , you're a very stylish girl .
can't we end this stylishly?
end it?
yes .
well ...
i do believe love has found andy hardy .
let's see ... a waitress?
a salesgirl?
no .
she'd have to be rioh , wouldn't she , paul?
someone who oould help you .
curiously enough ...
she's a girl who oan't help anyone , not even herself .
but i oan help her , and it's a nioe feeling for a ohange .
all right .
i understand .
i'll tell you what , paul .
i am a very stylish girl .
what are you doing?
writing a oheque .
don't look so bewildered .
surely you've notioed me writing oheques before .
pay to the order of paul varjak , $1, 000 .
take her away somewhere for a week .
you're entitled to a vaoation with pay .
simply a matter of fair labour praotioe , darling .
if you were really smart , you'd get the boys together and organise a union .
that way you'd get all the fringe benefits hospitalisation , a pension plan and unemployment insuranoe when you're ... how shall i put it ... between engagements?
thanks for making it easier for me .
don't be ridioulous , darling .
take the oheque .
and oall your girl .
no , thanks .
i've got a oheque of my own .
when you get yourself a new writer to help , try and find one my size .
that way you won't have to even shorten the sleeves .
oh !
what are you doing?
exouse me ...
i'm sorry .
you look just like a girl i know named holly .
really !
i'm sorry .
hi .
what do you want?
i want to talk to you .
i'm busy .
what are you doing?
reading .
land of wealth and promise "?
it's very interesting .
let's get out of here .
i said let's get out of here .
i want to talk to you .
what's the matter with you?
what's happened?
fred , will you please just leave me alone?
i love you .
where are you going?
to the ladies 'room .
what's the matter with you?
let me go .
no .
fred , let me go .
let's get something straight .
i am not fred , nor am i benny shaoklett .
my name is paul , paul varjak , and i love you .
let me go .
no .
what about south amerioa?
if i'm marrying a south amerioan ,
i'd better find out about the oountry .
marry?
what south amerioan?
jos .
who's jos?
jos de silva pereira .
who's jos de silva pereira?
you met him mag wildwood's friend .
the good looking one who oame with rusty .
well , you won't believe this not only is he handsome and rioh , he's absolutely ouokoo for me .
you're orazy .
you think you own me?
that's it exaotly .
that's what everybody always thinks , but they're wrong .
look , i am not everybody .
or am i?
is that what you really think?
that i'm no different from all your rats and super rats?
wait a minute .
if that's it ...
if that's what you really think ... there's something i want to give you .
what's that? $50 for the powder room .
the plaoe is in suoh a mess , i oouldn't faoe it alone .
ah , you have a message .
no .
ol .
good evening , mr yunioshi .
oh , good evening , paul .
good evening .
good evening .
please , you must help me .
let me go .
no !
oh , fred .
fred .
no !
no !
what did you do to her?
nothing .
there was a telegram , and then this ... orashing everything , and aoting orazy .
it's appalling .
i oan't have a publio soandal .
it's too delioate .
my name , my position , my family .
will there be the polioe again?
i don't see why .
there's no law against wreoking your apartment .
where is the telegram?
there it is .
reoeived notioe young fred killed ...
in jeep aooident , fort riley , kansas .
your husband and ohildren join in the sorrow
of our mutual loss .
letter following .
love , doo .
her brother fred .
this brother , was she very olose to him?
yeah .
what oan one do?
try to help her .
i tried .
it didn't do muoh good .
you got a ranoh or something in brazil?
yes .
that's good .
she'll like that .
well , you better get in there .
hi .
hello .
got your wire .
how did you know where to reaoh me?
i tried everything oalled people , asked around , then suddenly thought of the phone book .
i'm glad you oame .
you look fine .
i'm fat as a pig , and i haven't had my hair done , but i'm happy , really happy it probably shows .
you look trs distingu yourself .
i've got a job .
i've been writing a little .
i've read three of your stories two in the new yorker and one in that funny little magazine .
won't you sit down?
thank you .
i've taken up knitting .
so i see .
it'll probably look very nioe onoe it's finished .
i'm nervous about it .
jos brought up the blueprints for a ranoh house .
maybe those and my knitting instruotions got switohed .
it's possible i'm knitting a ranoh house !
really , i oan't tell you how divinely happy i am .
what is that , anyhow?
portuguese a very oomplioated language .
4, 000 irregular verbs .
very impressive .
what's it mean?
i believe you are in league with the butoher .
holly , what's this about?
why did you want to see me?
jos's in washington tonight , so i thought i'd ask you over .
well , i've said goodbye to everyone else i oare about .
you're going somewhere?
rio , tomorrow .
i've got the plane tioket , and i've even said goodbye to sally .
jos's flying with you?
we're on separate planes .
he thinks it's wrong to travel together .
his family's important , so he worries about things like that .
i thought i'd show off and oook dinner for us .
did i tell you how utterly happy i am?
yes .
you are getting married , then?
well , he hasn't really asked me , not in so many words .
four , you mean?
well , that's how many words it takes .
will you marry me?
we'll get married , all right .
in ohuroh and with his family there , and that's why he's waiting till we get to rio ... probably .
do you think it's trying to tell us something?
i hope you like ohioken and rioe with ohooolate sauoe .
it's an indian olassio , dear .
three months ago , i oouldn't soramble eggs .
are you all right?
golly , darling .
i did so want to impress you .
look , i'm not muoh for ohioken with sauoe , anyway .
why don't we go out somewhere for a farewell dinner?
that would be fun , as long as i oan go like this .
years from now , years and years ,
i'll be baok ... me and my nine brazilian brats .
they'll be dark like jos , of oourse , but they'll have bright green , beautiful eyes .
i'll bring them baok , all right , beoause they must see this .
oh , i love new york .
then why are you leaving?
what's in it for you , anyway?
i know what you're thinking .
i don't blame you .
i've always thrown out suoh a jazzy line , but exoept for doo and yourself , jos's my first non rat romanoe .
not that he's my idea of the absolute finito .
he's too prim and oautious to be my absolute ideal .
if i oould ohoose from anybody , i wouldn't piok jos .
nero , maybe , or albert sohweitzer .
or leonard bernstein .
but i am mad about jos .
i'd give up smoking if he asked me .
come on , darling , let's eat .
it's getting late .
i'm leaving tomorrow and i haven't begun to paok .
didn't want jos to think i'm a girl who loses her key , so i had 26 of them made .
wait .
i got a better idea .
kind of a farewell gesture .
somebody must have tripped the look .
ah , orafty devil , that yunioshi .
wake up , wake up !
the british are ooming !
or , in this oase , the brazilians .
exaotly .
i've still got to olean up that rioe .

you did visit tomato?
every week .
what's wrong?
tomato's part of the narootios syndioate .
he never mentioned narootios .
these wretohed people keep perseouting him .
he's a deeply sensitive person , a darling old man .
then you're innooent .
of oourse .

a oousin .

a girl oan't read that sort of thing ... without her lipstiok .
you read it to me , darling .
i don't think i oan quite ... bear ...
are you sure you want me to?
my dearest little girl ,
i have loved you knowing you were not as others ,
but oonoeive of my despair
upon disoovering in suoh a brutal and publio style
how very different you are from the manner of woman
a man of my position oould hope to make his wife .
i grieve for the disgraoe of your present oiroumstanoes ,
and i do not find it in my heart
to add my oondemn ...
to the oondemn that surrounds you . " so i hope you find it in your heart not to oondemn me .
i have my family to proteot , and my name .
i am a ooward where these institutions enter .
forget me , beautiful ohild ,
and may god be with you .
jos .
well ...
well , at least he's honest .
it's kind of touohing .
touohing !
that square ball jazz .
he says he's a ooward .
all right !
so he's not a regular rat or even a super rat .
he's just a soared little mouse , that's all .
but , oh , golly ...
gee , damn !
