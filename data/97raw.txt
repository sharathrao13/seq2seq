rocky's hurt .
a right hand from drago sends rocky balboa 15 feet across the ring .
come on .
get up !
it's been a one sided fight so far .
and drago throws a hard right hand that stuns rocky balboa .
they might have to stop this one before somebody gets killed .
rocky taking punishment .
he is completely exhausted .
and balboa goes down again from a right hand .
punch after punch .
amazing willpower !
rocky balboa has taken ivan drago's best punches so far .

especially apollo !
yo , tony .

how's everybody doin 'out there?
everything's ok .
what's wrong?
what's wrong?
remember when mick said when he was fighting sometimes , he'd fight so hard that he was thinking that he broke something inside?
he was gonna die?
and that's what he said , that's when the angels was pulling on him .
rocky , you're scaring me .
i don't know what's wrong .
i can't ...
can't what?
i can't stop my hands from shaking .
i ain't never felt this thing .
you better see a doctor .

airport security .
welcome home .
there's a press reception inside .
rocky , how did you feel about the russian people?
you know , very good .
they was great people .
i didn't understand what they said all the time , but i knew what they meant .
mrs balboa , did you learn any russian?
did i learn russian?
yeah , she got fluent in vodka .
rocky , there are rumours of physical complications .
complications?
no , those were rumours .
he's in perfect physical condition .
rocky , the american medical association has recommended that boxing be banned .
yeah .
do you agree with the doctors?
yeah , absolutely .
i think that doctors should never fight .
that was a beautiful answer , champ .
doctors should stay out of the ring .
doctors should never fight .
rocky balboa , the funniest champion ever .
america's own rocky balboa !
how are ya?
george washington duke , promoter extraordinaire , welcomes rocky balboa , champion of all the americas and all of the russias .
i would like to digress from the questions a bit and pose a proposition to the media .
everyone in this city and in the world of sports knows my reputation for promoting some of the finest extravaganzas in this country .
well now , with the press present , i'd like to ask you , rocky balboa , to be the flamboyant , rambunctious sportsman we know you can be .
give this man , union cane , a chance to challenge you for the heavyweight championship .
balboa , i want the opportunity to take what you got .
isn't it bad timing to challenge , duke?
the man just got off the plane .
timing is the essence of life , gentlemen and ladies .
now what i have on this paper is the largest guarantee ever offered to a champion on this planet .
i'm talking about a fantastic international extravaganza , to be held in japan , called lettin 'it go in tokyo .
it's incredible .
only in america do people like us rise from oppression and poverty to join hands in this international event .
excuse me .
only in america !
excuse me .
my husband is retired .
he has nothing more to prove .
wait a minute !
hey , rocky ...
don't you consider this a public responsibility to respond now?
respond to the people .
isn't this about professionalism?
to talk about it now , not later .
do you mind if i heal first?
you got nothin 'like what i got for you .
what the hell does this all mean?
that isn't enough .
we gotta know now .
gotta think about that .
so anyway ,
i wanna tell everybody that the flight over was really nice .
come on , guys .
we need more .
adrian , if you weren't with me ,
i never woulda done as good .
you're always there .
and my kid , having you is like being born all over again .
come on .
are you gonna retire or not?
anyway , excuse me .
i'd like to go home .
give us something to write .
thanks very much .
i appreciate it .

don't worry .
we'll get him .
no , really .
it's great .
look at this place !
i swear i ain't never leavin 'this place again , you know that?
hey , would you like to dance?
how about a homecoming dance for your old man?
no , don't be silly .
it's cold .
i'll warm you up , young lady .

hurry up .
the music's almost over .
do you like the song?
you should rest .
yeah , i know .
i'm tired .
come on .
maybe i'll take you upstairs and violate you like a parkin 'meter .
cost you a quarter .
yo , adrian !
where'd you learn to talk dirty like that?
uncle paulie , you notice something strange about dad?
he just took a few hard shots .
i think you tell better jokes than me , adrian .
did i hear somebody call for their old man?
did you do this?
sleep time , kid , ok?
dad , did you know your bones grow three times as fast at night?
no , i didn't , but i heard somethin 'like that .
is that me?
oh yeah , that's you .
excellent !
is that me?
when we was fishin ', right?
yeah .
that's beautiful !
look at the tent .
you know , the fish was a lot bigger , if i recall .
actually , that was a lot smaller .
anyway , come on .
hit the bed .
it's time for you to get healthy .
this is great .
i don't know where you learned this .
it is something how this thing comes out of your fingers and ...
oh my god .
who's this?
it's madame dupont , my french teacher .
really?
yeah .
she looks french , sure .
i wouldn't show this to your mother , cos she don't understand french too good .
god .
better cover that one up .
well , champ , it's bedtime .
hey , you know what?
i know some french talk .
knock , knock .
who's there?
madame .
madame who?
ma damn foot's caught in the door !
that's an old joke .
what do you want from me?
i'm trying .
i don't know all the good things , you know?
what's this?
what?
look what i found in your ear .
russian money .
money ears !
all right .
anyway , listen .
you gotta get some sleep .
dad?
today , when you said having me was like being born again ...
yeah?
what did you mean?
well , you know , you come up like i did and you got , like , three square meals of zero a day , know what i mean?
you got the a side of life and the b side .
i'm on the b side , but you ... you got all the breaks .
so when i see you having all these things that i didn't have ,
i , like , live through your eyes .
i enjoy it a little bit .
it's like having it all over again .
that's nice .
hey , look in my face .
do i look like a raccoon?
a little bit .
like rocky raccoon?
yeah , a little bit .
nah !
yeah , you do a little .
really?
hey , if you think i look bad , you oughta see the other guy's knuckles .
anyway , yo .
good night .
ok , kid?

dad?
yo?
glad you're home .
thanks .
i appreciate it .
we'll play tomorrow , ok?
maybe you can show me your english teacher .
she's pretty hot , too .
nah !
good night , kid .
you deserve the worst for what you did .
that was rocky's money .
you wanna be hysterical?
you cost us everything .
it was a mistake .
you think i thought this was gonna happen?
don't you walk away from me .
you just gave up our life !
and you think it's some stupid thing?
paulie , do you know what you did?
do you know how serious it is?
i understand it !
i understand the whole freakin 'thing !
i understand it .
your accountant's a crook , not me !
i did what i thought was right .
don't blame me .
i want to murder the bum worse than anybody .
adrian , what's wrong?
look what you done now .
she's dumpin 'it all on me .
come on , don't turn this around on me .
what did you do?
he gave power of attorney to our accountant .
i just didn't gave anything to nobody .
he sent a letter .
he says " we'll be in russia a couple of months and i need rocky to sign a tax extension " .
that extension was a power of attorney , paulie !
he's the thief !
i need alcohol .
rocky , on my eyes , i never stole a freakin 'dime .
adrian , what's happenin 'here?
it's gone .
what's gone?
the money .
the money .
everything .
it's all gone .
the piece of paper paulie had you sign wasn't a request for a tax extension .
it was a blanket power of attorney in favour of the accountant , who was involved in some high priced real estate .
he thought he could have your money back before you knew it was gone .
unfortunately for you and everybody in this room , his deals fell through because the market dried up .
and you lost millions .
ain't there nothin 'i can do?
i've filed eight criminal acts against him .
but you've got debt payment on this property , he didn't pay your tax returns and your mortgage hasn't been paid in months .
we didn't have a mortgage .
our house was fully paid for .
don't take it from me .
ask him .
there's nearly $400, 000 outstanding .
the only thing that is not encumbered is a gym , willed to your son by a mickey goldmill in 1982 .
you can sell things .
remember those commercials you did?
i ain't no commercial kinda guy .
i'm a fighter .
that's what i do .
no , we couldn't get sponsors .
with the investigation of the accountant , out pops a criminal record of rocky's for assault .
but that was a long time ago .
he didn't know ...
why not a couple more fights?
with your popularity , you'd be out in no time .
he's retiring .
rocko , fighting's the ticket .
i said he's retired !
paulie , we're here because of you .
i'm not taking the heat for all this .
i thought i was doing smart business .
you thought you did smart business?
hey !
the accountant was your choice .
you shoulda known he was a thief , but in your fairy tale world the air don't move .
you're like a season that don't change .
hey , enough .
i'm not no tomato can you kick around .
you call duke .
tell him i'll fight cane .
i don't care .
anywhere , any time .
no .
rocky , no !
if that's what you want , i'll get on it .
rocky , please .
a couple of fights , we're outta trouble .
yeah , but you said ...
no , i didn't say anything .
did we come this far to lose it?
you have to see a doctor .
i don't need a doctor .
i need a promoter .
if the doctor says ok , i'll support you .
i gotta fight , ok?
i got problems .
i gotta fight .
will you do it for me?
all right .
for you .
because of continuous violent blows to the head , you have a condition particular to boxers called cavum septum pellucidum , which is a hole in the membrane separating the ventricles .
the brain surface neurons in this area have also been traumatised .
simply stated , mr balboa , it means that you have suffered damage to the brain .
how long until he recovers?
the effects are irreversible .
rocky , you have to retire .
i don't wanna retire .
this ain't the time to retire .
not in here , not in no office .
i just fought the best fight of my life .
i just did that , you know?
and all i need is a couple more .
no .
you suffered severe brain trauma .
he could be wrong .
anybody could be wrong .
he ain't god .
adrian , only god ain't wrong .
rocky , this is what's good for you .
i only need a couple of easy ones .
not the way it is .
you can't get licensed in any state .
he can't , can he , doctor?
that is correct .
rocky , do you love me?
yeah , i love you .
why do you ask that?
because if you love somebody , you live with them , you live for them .
you don't gamble with a life .
rocky , i don't care about the money .
it's you .
that's all that matters .
please .
we'll be ok .
we'll be fine .
no one has to know , doctor , right?
it'll be strictly confidential .
thank you .
may we hear our next bid , please?
are you done?
sold .
moving along , ladies and gentlemen .
item number 46 ...
hey , kid .
bike's been sold .
hey , bike's been sold .
get off the bike .
come on .
don't worry about it .
we been down before .
i'll get it all back .
we just gotta stick together , hey?
home team .
yeah , right .
come on .
you know , mickey used to say a fight ain't over till you heard the bell .
we ain't heard a bell yet , have we?
rocky balboa's boxing gloves from his first fight ...
rocky?
hey , it still fits .
why are you wearin 'those clothes?
i was just going through some stuff and i found them .
they feel kinda comfortable .
i was looking all over for you downstairs .
it's kind of depressing .
yeah , i know what you mean .
what's this doin 'in your ear?
oh , god !
remember these?
yeah .
i remember when you took 'em off .
that's right .
first time i ever kissed you .
adrian , i wanna go out for a bit .
you know , just take a little walk .
i just wanna feel better .
but hey , could you talk to the kid?
cos he's really taking this hard .
sure .
where are you going?
i thought i'd go to andy's .
he used to be a champion .
how did he blow it all?
how you doing , mick?
slip the jab .
slip the jab !
that's right .
that's it .
hey , i didn't hear no bell !
ok .
all right !
that's right .
slip the jab .
that's it .
mentalise !
see that bum in front of you .
you see yourself doing right , and you do right .
that's pretty .
that's very pretty .
time !
come here , rock .
my god , you're ready , ain't ya?
apollo won't know what hit him .
you'll roll over him like a bulldozer .
an italian bulldozer .
you know , kid , i know how you feel about this fight that's comin 'up .
because i was young once , too .
i tell you somethin '.
why , if you wasn't here ,
i probably wouldn't be alive today .
the fact that you're here and doing as well as you're doing gives me ...
what do you call it?
a motivisation to stay alive .
cos i think that people die sometimes when they don't wanna live no more .
nature's smarter than people think .
and nature is smarter than people think .
what the hell am i living around here for?
i got no reason to go on " .
but with you , kid ...
boy , i got a reason to go on .
and i'm gonna stay alive .
and i will watch you make good .
and i'll never leave you .
i'll never leave you until that happens .
cos when i leave you , you'll not only know how to fight , you'll be able to take care of yourself outside the ring , too .
is that ok?
it's ok .
ok .
i got a gift for you .
ah , mickey .
wait a minute now .
really , i don't need nothin '.
look at that .
see that?
this here's the favourite thing that i have on this earth .
and rocky marciano give me that .
you know what it was?
his cuff link .
and now i'm giving it to you .
and it's gonna be like ...
like an angel on your shoulder to you .
and if you ever get hurt and you feel that you're goin 'down , this little angel is gonna whisper in your ear .
he's gonna say " get up , you son of a bitch !
cos mickey loves you " .
ok?
thanks , mick .
i love you , too .
jesus .
go after him , kid .
go after him .
thanks .
you was the angel .
there it is .
what happened to his other cuff link?
i don't know .
he only give me one .
he gave it to some bum .
careful .
don't worry about these .
all right , let's go , paulie .
i really can't believe it .
this kid's taking this too good .
hey , rock , it's good i kept the place , right?
it saves money .

right?
a little aluminum on the front too .
it's a winner !
thank you .

it's only temporary , you know?
come on inside .
hello?
mrs balboa?
george washington duke here .
yes?
mrs balboa , can you hear it?
listen close .
you must be able to hear it .
hear what?
the sound of the parade going by , of opportunity knocking .
what'll take to get you to realize
i'm givin 'you a chance to pull yourselves together?
let me handle your husband's career and you can live like human beings again .
listen , mr duke , we're living like human beings .
you oughta try it some time .
and leave my husband alone .
women !
when'd you start that?
i don't know .
it's like a bad habit that comes back .
but , hey !
we ain't talkin 'about me .
we're talkin 'about you .
hey , rocky , how you doin ', man?
good to see you back .
thanks .
great to be back .
you're smart in school , but you gotta be smart on the street , too .
how do you mean?
you gotta know who the players are
and who you're talkin 'to .
watch out for scams .
everyone scams .
what's a scam?
ask your father .
a scam is like a hustle .
he don't get it .
well , a hustle's related to ...
rocky !
remember me?
i'm bubba's mother .
oh , yeah .
you used his head for a punchin 'bag .
yeah , he had a nice head .
anyway , a hustle's related to a con .
he don't get it .
a deception?
you're saying beware of deceptions .
yeah , that's good .
absolutely .
you're very smart , you know?
ain't this where the atomic hoagy shop used to be?
i'm new here , dad .
this neighbourhood's got tooth decay .
it's called urban blight .
i'll tell you somethin ', this place is blightin 'everywhere .
a little aluminum siding and paint , this place could be ok .
what do you think?
anyway , we're late for school .
paulie , i wanna talk to the kid private like .
like i got no feelings .
oh , come on .
that's how wars start .
relax , would you?
so anyway , everybody's got an angle .
tough break , rock .
everybody's got a hustle .
these kids have got street brains .
that's how they live .
these kids ain't like no personalities that you've grown up with .
so you gotta stay very sharp round here .
i intend to .
intend !
you know , sometimes you make me feel very stupid .
why?
why?
cos you're smarter than me .
no , i'm not .
yeah , you are .
it's like every day you learn somethin 'new and i forget somethin 'new .
but hey , listen .
we're in this thing together .
if you can figure out how to fix things up , don't be afraid to tell me .
we gotta stick together , cos what are we?

oh , home team .
home team !
you've got that right .
i used to go to this school when i was a kid .
nice bricks .
it was real tough then .
but i think you can handle it , don't you think?
if you went here , i can go here .
i'm not scared really .
really?
well , i guess i'm a little scared .
but that's normal , don't you think?
oh , yeah .
i had 72 fights ... .. and every one of 'em i was scared , so yeah , you know , that's real , real normal .
i'll see you later .
ok , kid .
here's the front door .

home team .

you know , i'm really worried about the kid .
he ain't used to livin 'like this .
he don't know the streets .
at school , i know what's gonna happen .
some wise guy's gonna come up to him cos he's my kid and try to bang him out .
give him a cheap shot , you know?
i mean , jeez ...
mr balboa , my name's tommy gunn .

what'd you say?
it's blight .
urban blight .
george wants you to consider wearing gloves again .
it's a helluva payday .
i'm officially expired .
you have marquee value .
you put asses into seats .
a businessman don't retire if he can still pull in the bread .
only america gives these opportunities .
union cane's going for the title .
here's some tickets .
we've a strong feeling about this .
if he takes it , that's the time to challenge .
people love comebacks .
there's nothing more commercial than a long shot comeback of a down on his luck underdog .
virtue has never been as respectable as money " .
who's twain?
a painter .
you're the great white hope .
you mean great white dope .
no , forget it .
hold the bullshit .
i know the problem .
you think i was born yesterday?
merlin , show him the paper .
this is your medical report .
we can work around it .
where'd you get this?
it doesn't matter .
if you fight cane , george can guarantee to get you a license .
guaranteed .
you can do this?
no problem .
this comeback's in the bag .
the time's hot .
the deal's hot .
caliente !
we could use one more payday .
adrian , where'd you come from?
mrs balboa just appeared !
she's magic .
i don't think you're funny .
are you talking him into fighting?
talking business , darlin '.
do you like feelin 'hard up?
do you like reachin 'in your pocket and only feelin 'your leg?
i didn't think so .
i'm offering you the opportunity to dump this loser image .
who are you talking to?
you ain't workin 'across ...
what the hell are you talkin 'about?
this is a tremendous opportunity .
opportunity for who?
for you to make money?
for him to be disabled?
what would you do if the choices were reversed?
you have to think about that .
rocky , they don't care about you .
let's get serious .
you represent the dreams of the long shots .
the little people identify with you .
that is the key to public success .
you a true champion , a true product of the people .
sell it while they'll still buy .
that ain't gonna last forever .
you say you a fighter , then fight !
and i'll make you so much money you can swim in it .
you can swim , can't you?
whaddaya say?
put some hustle behind this muscle .
he's done .
he's done fighting !
you are a damn fool .
maybe we oughta sign mrs balboa to fight cane , huh?
looks like she's the one with the cojones in the family .
you don't talk like that in front of my wife .
that ain't no park bench , boy .
i'll get him .
rocky , i'm really sorry .
i didn't wanna ...
you guys want privacy?
i'll be upstairs .
rocky .
rocky , i'm sorry .
i ...
but it just takes one bad hit and you could be an invalid .
i feel like an invalid already .
why'd you come back?
you're too smart for this .
i got nothing to do .
i called gloria .
she said she could use part time help .
but why do you wanna do this?
why go back to where you started?
i gotta do it , but you don't gotta do it !
i wanted to be there so i could be close to you .

you know , it's gettin 'cold out here .
maybe we better get inside , ok?
i understand .

i need an angle .
i'll fight balboa right now .
i'm better than balboa ever was .
hey !

i guess it's cos i wanna get out .
you know how it is .
you know , for an italian kid , you ain't got a bad butt .
first money i get , i'm goin 'to miami .
why miami?
miami needs new gigolos .
yeah , i read somethin 'like that .
my back is getting bad .

adrian's too good for this .
this place really depresses me , paul .

tommy gunn .

i'd like to try again .
kid , i'd like to help , but i really don't know nothin 'about managin '.
man , all i'm askin 'for is a chance .
if i screw up , then hell , i'll leave .
what have you got to lose?

it's what you got to lose .
i got nothin 'to lose .
maybe you do .
what if i don't do good , right?
and you don't make it?
i don't want you blaming me for this , kid , you know?
here's what i would do if i was you .
listen to me .
if i was you ,
i would go home and talk to your family people .
come up with somethin 'better .
i got no family people .
all i got is what you see here .
i know all about you , back from your first fight with apollo creed .
i read about how no one ever gave you a chance .
i'm not from the same streets as you , but i'm hungry , like you were .
ever since i put on gloves i've wanted to meet you .
cos i knew that if anybody could make me a winner , it was you .
hey , paulie , you see a winner standing here?
yes !
man , you beat the best .
nobody could ever say different .
look , rocky , you don't know me , but anything you want me to do , i'll do .
and if i can't , i'll bust my butt tryin '.
i'm not hustlin 'you , man .
all i'm askin 'for is a chance .
i mean , just one shot .
are you hungry?
yeah .
yeah?
come on .
you're really gonna like the way adrian cooks .
she does amazing things with macaroni , especially tomatoes .
but i gotta warn you , she can be a little vicious with the garlic !
so why'd this kid smack your face?
it really doesn't matter , dad .
it does matter .
they took his coat .
i don't want the coat .
they took the one with the collar?
i'll go to your school and ...
you'll make it worse .
can't i do what i think is right?
what do you think is right?
a baseball bat across the face .
paulie !
adrian , can i have the plate?
yes , rocky .
i had trouble like that when i was in school .
" pretend the guy's like a balloon " .
balloon?
she said if you pop 'em hard , these guys just go away .
tommy , we're trying to raise our son so he can handle his problems with his mind , not his muscles .
sorry .
that's why i'll get mangled .
you ain't gonna get mangled .
dad , will you teach me how to fight?
a baseball bat would be nice .
do you wanna grow up and just use your fists?
adrian , i don't think it'd be so bad if i taught him how to throw a few ... deadly punches .
tommy , did your dad teach you to fight?
no , not exactly .
i had to ...
sweetheart , don't get personal .
no , it's ok .
you see , my old man , he used to drink a lot .
seriously .
he'd go out with his friends , then he'd come home , look to punch on me .
he'd punch on my mother , too .
he did that a lot of times .
so growing up , i only thought about fightin 'my father .
you know , when i was 1 3 , i got in trouble at school .
he tied me down and whipped me so bad i couldn't walk for a week .
i couldn't do anything .
the first guy i ever knocked out was my father .
in the ring , it's like all i see is him .
that's kinda sick , huh?
yo , tommy , at least you had an old man to knock out , you know?
yeah .
i didn't even have that .
some day you can punch out your pop .
paulie , what you telling him that for?
it's the fittest of the survival .
tommy , where you stayin 'tonight?
oh , i'll find some place to stay .
no , i tell you what .
we got room down in the basement .
what about me?
your son is sleeping there .
well , he can stay with his uncle .
what am i , a pit stop?
i don't wanna cause any problems .
i can find a place to stay .
no , it's ok .
it's just for a little while , you know .
right?
no problem at all .
hey , kid .
i appreciate it .
it's cold outside .
i'm not changing no sheets .
hey , since when have you ever?
tommy , why don't you come on down?
we'll show you the whole place .
why don't you go downstairs and show your father what you did today?
hey , junior !
your plumbing don't leak , do it?
you know this guy?
yeah .
he hits hard .
adrian can really cook !
yeah , she's ok .
listen , tommy .
we ain't had a chance to get this place too nice .
we'll get it together in a while , you know?
wow !
man , this is what it's about .
holy mackerel !
why do you keep this stuff down here?
when did you get a chance to do this?
he took it all out of a box .
it's beautiful .
you painted ...
when did you get a chance to do this , kid?
after school .
it's no big deal .
where'd you get the glove?
oh , this?
thanks .
this is one of my favourite objects .
mickey give me this before he departed .
it was rocky marciano's cuff link .
really?
the real rocky marciano?
you got me thinkin 'about mickey .
i wanna show you something .
he told me a long time ago ...
he says that fighting is like 90 % in the skull and 10 % in the body .
this is what he says to me .
dad , i met this really nice girl today .
really?
that's wonderful .
she's a lot better than ...
wait a minute .
don't change the station .
i'll be right back .
i just wanna tell tommy a few things .
hey , who was your best friend back in orlando?
that's oklahoma .
well , yeah .
eric elder .
no , no .
your best friend is a guy named frankie fear .
you see , fear is a fighter's best friend .
it ain't nothin 'to be ashamed of .
you see , fear keeps you sharp .
it keeps you awake .
it makes you wanna survive .
but the thing is , you gotta learn how to control it .
cos fear is like this fire and it's burning deep inside .
now , if you control it , tommy , it's gonna make you hot .
but , you see , if this thing here controls you , it's gonna burn you and everythin 'else around you up .
that's right .
anyway , these are the things that was taught to me and , if you want , i'd like to teach to you .
this mean you're gonna manage me?
absolutely .
hey , home team .
all right !
let's go for it .
do you mind showin 'me a few things?
sure , tommy .
i'll show you a lot of things .
hey , rich boy .
how much you got in your pocket today?
nothin '.
come on , let's have it .
i got nothin '.
come on , gimme the money .
come on !
hey , i gotta eat .
he's hungry , he's gotta eat .
well , eat this .
i got it .
go !
father carmine !
father carmine !
maybe he's not home .
priests is always home .
i didn't wanna disturb you that much , father .
oh , excellent .
everything is perfect .
father , this is my new friend , tommy gunn .
i was wondering ...
tommy here's a fighter and i'm his manager .
i wondered if you'd do me a favour , if you ain't busy .
could you throw us a couple blessings?
one , that i don't mess up as a manager .
and b , that tommy does as good as i think he can do : great .
and don't get hurt none .
could you do that?
i love it when he does that .
thanks , father !
really appreciate this .
any time .
ok .
i'll see you in church .
hey , man , what'd you do this for?
it don't hurt havin 'an angel on your side .
hey , rock .
how's it going?
doin 'great , guys .
slow down or you'll get a ticket !
this is tommy gunn .
he'll be a champ .
how you doin ', tom?
all right , break it up .
break !
get off the ropes !
go easy .
man , i need more work .
no , you're ready .
no , this guy's killing me .
you're ready now .
you're perfect .
he's killing me .
i feel weak .
no , listen to me .
shut up !
mick used to say the only difference between a hero and a coward is the hero's willing to go for it .
take the shot .
this guy here is scared too .
you're both scared .
remember in the basement we talked about fear?
how it was like this fire?
you gotta control it or it burns you up .
or it's gonna burn him up .
make it work for you , tommy .
i would never do nothin 'to hurt you , understand?
fear is like this fire , ok?
now let it burn until it becomes like this volcano .
when you see the openin ', explode all over this guy , ok?
now , you can take him , ok?
it ain't all muscle , it's all heart .
heart and fire !
ok , now you do it .
remember , i'm like this angel on your shoulder .
i ain't gonna let nothin 'happen to you .
go for it .
come on , tommy .
jab !
left , right !
the body !
