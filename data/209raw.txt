it 's never gonna work , guys .
sure it will .
trust us .
i hope no one sees us .
lf we get caught .
nobody is gonna get caught .
so they just let you tip 'em over?
they're gotta be sleeping , so shush .
baby , come on .
you ruined the element of surprise .
eike they weren't going to wake up anyway .
yo , come here .
no , dude .
that 's a bull .
so?
you ever seen a pissed off bull?
i think they're a little scared .
big bull .
no way , man .
you kid .
what do we get if we pull this off?
what do they get?
okay .
we'll give you both lap dances .
full or partial nudity?
full .
that 'll work .
alright .
we'd like to do this .
there's no way they'll pull it off .
go .
damn , i think we killed it .
no way , man .
it was already dead .
what?
we just lucked out .
you two are so shakin 'them asses .
that 's right .
no , that doesn't count .
the deal was to tip the bull .
and the bull has been tipped .
but look at it .
no baby , don't touch it .
what is it?
what is that?
eet 's get the hell out of here .
eet 's go .
come on , johnny .
eet 's go .
eet 's go .
come on !
mr. eong?
mr. eong .
what do you want?
you got business here?
you called me , about a sick cow?
where's the company vet old felix?
i believe he retired .
well , got this one here .
and another one in the barn .
only she ain't dead , just mighty sick .
was this one sick?
she didn't show it if she was .
any idea what might have taken down a14oo pound animal like this?
ain't been nothin 'in these parts for a long time .
to take down a girl like this .
i'm gonna take a look at the sick one .
easy girl .
easy .
id never had trouble with this one until about two months ago .
all of the sudden she started putting on weight .
and now this .
they ain't hook worms or round worms .
i know that .
could be liver fluke cysts .
i don't think so .
even ol 'felix could have told me that right off .
i'm sure it 's nothing to worry about .
but i am gonna take a sample .
help yourself .
thank you .
how many cattle do you have?
must be about fifty head .
do they graze , or do you have 'em on feed?
everybody around here uses the same feed .
specially in the winter time .
it 's free .
i reckon it sweetens the pill .
what do you mean?
what pill?
company gives us free feed .
in exchange we gotta sell our cattle to host tender meats .
eike i said , the corporate machine .
corporations can do just about anything they want in this country .
amen to that .
can i get a batch of that feed?
take whatever you want , doc .
what 's that?
anthelmintic .
it 's totally safe .
it 'll kill the parasites ... but wont harm her at all .
i promise .
easy , girl .
easy , easy .
that should hopefully do it .
do me a favor .
call me if she gets any worse .
i'll let you know if anything out of the ordinary comes up .
i appreciate that , doc .
come on cooter .
come .
come on .
tom .
it 's eli rudkus .
eli rudkus .
don't hang up .
just listen .
i gotta send you a specimen .
specimen?
what is it?
it looks like a liver fluke .
doesn't act like one .
i've never seen anything like this .
the last time this happened , you almost cost me my jb .
i know .
i just wanna know what these things are .
fine , just send it to me .
alright .
first thing in the morning .
i'll have it then .
thanks .
cooter !
come on .
cooter !
come on !
cooter !
cooter !
cooter !
dumb dog .
cooter?
is that you?
thank you .
that 's enough .
take a seat everybody .
are we having a good time yet?
i wanna welcome one and all .
to what 's certainly gonna be another successful ... fund raiser for our fair town .
i also ... wanna offer my appreciation for those who participated in testing .
host tender meat 's new feed .
we spent a lot of money and time on the research ... and the results , as you all know , have far exceeded our expectations .
we are going to be the sole supplier of a new class of beef .
healthier and tastier than anything on the market .
what does this mean for all of you?
an increase of up to 12 %% ... in price per head .
you heard me right .
your cows are gonna be larger and stronger than ever .
and the meat .
sam , hold up one of those steaks .
i want you to tell me if that 's not the best beef you've ever tasted .
you've all brought a good appetite so enough from me .
get on over there and have a good time , alright?
thank you for coming out .
a vegetarian in beef country?
i hope nobody will hold that against me .
around here , they just might .
eli rudkus .
how ya doing?
milo turner .
who are you visiting in town?
actually , i just moved here .
really?
i got a .
i got a thing .
you're the new vet .
felix's replacement .
thought i'd come in early .
and get a head start drumming up a little business .
i got a little experience how small towns work .
what do you think of our town?
i like it .
it 's nice .
the people are friendly .
what more could you ask for?
so what do you do here?
there's a bowling ally in town .
i mean like a job , like for work or .
host tender meats , head of r and d.
that 's great .
you got a lot of people on that feed .
most use it .
some don't .
why?
well , i found some pretty interesting parasites ... in the feces of some of the cattle .
i can't figure out where they came from .
i'm sure it 's no big deal , it 's just that i wanna know .
it can't look too good for the new vet ... to come in town and get stumped right off the bat .
how's your burger?
i'm sure it 'll be okay .
i need this wrapped up by friday .
fax the paper work over to my office and i'll take care of it .
so , i hear we have a little problem .
good for you .
the only time lawyers make my money .
so what is it?
the board's serious about having you removed as president .
you don't understand the gravity of the situation?
have you any idea if they found out the costs of the clinical trials?
the trials are fine .
i don't need somebody ... questioning how i run my company .
to be honest with you , i can understand how they feel .
people think the money is landing in corporate benefit packages .
every penny was invested ... in the future of this company .
why don't you show them that?
i will , but not right now .
three months , i'll have the new meat on to market .
what do you want me to do?
call the board .
convince them to give me the time i need .
you should've seen the ranchers when i said about the price increase .
and it was nothing , 12 %% .
i'm talking about a 3oo % % increase in profits !
if i report that to the board , they'll turn cartwheels .
and they'll stay off my back forever .
hailey?
good to see you .
fletcher ... this is eli .
dr. eli rudkus , the new vet .
welcome to host , dr. rudkus .
call me eli .
we didn't expect to see you so soon , did we milo?
no , we didn't .
excuse me .
why no one mentioned that the vet was arriving two weeks early?
because no one knew .
someone should have , milo .
i tend to agree .
and he's another felix .
already asking the wrong questions .
i got a table over there , if you wanna sit down .
you trying to pick me up?
me?
no .
god , no .
just trying to be friendly .
that 's the host way .
where do you come from?
eots of places .
so you're a bit of a man of mystery?
i wish .
no , absolutely not .
i'm completely harmless .
well , i'm not .
good to know .
patrick !
patrick !
hey you .
you having fun?
you wanna play , too?
jase , toss it to em .
i'll get it .
don't worry .
i'll go after it .
jason .
mom !
what the hell is that?
don't know .
go check on it .
doc , come on .
eet me take a look .
what 's this guy's name?
what 's his name?
get back .
patrick .
give him some room .
get back .
patrick , can you hear me?
give me some room , please .
eet doc cummings do his work .
what 's he doing , doctor?
call an ambulance .
dispatch?
we need an ambulance asap .
bell creek park .
a tender meats victim .
possible heart attack .
patrick whistler .
i understand , but i don't believe it 's even a remote possibility .
how can i put this?
the parasites i found in that stream .
there's frogs , too ... but that doesn't mean they jumped on him and caused the heart attack .
i'm trying to be serious here .
so am i.
patrick stabilized .
great .
just do the test .
please .
i'll do the test if it will get you off my back .
but i'm not going to wake patrick up just to go to the bathroom .
so it may be a few hours or days , it depends on his regularity .
take my cell number .
call me if there's a change in his condition .
thank you .
may i help you?
no , i'm good .
thanks .
tom ridgeway .
hey , tom .
i don't think we've seen a parasite like this before .
wait , it 's not even in the international database?
nope .
we ran it twice to be sure .
so we are ... ... looking at an entirely new species?
0r a mutation of some sort .
it's got a similarstructure to the common liver fluke .
i found more in the stream here so .
think we should definitely quarantine the cattle .
that would be prudent .
tom .
could you back me up on this?
i have no choice , considering the test results , don't you think?
thank you .
i appreciate that .
sure , i mean .
eet me know if something happens .
absolutely .
alright .
tom?
what is it?
thank you .
no problem .
a city meeting .
hi .
my name is dr rudkus .
i know i've only been here a while , but i've come across something ... that could be a concern to all of us .
but before that , could i just get a show of hands ... of how many people here are having problem with parasites?
right here .
right here .
that 's what i thought .
the good news is i have isolated the parasite .
and i've sent a specimen off to the department of agriculture .
i don't want to alarm anyone .
but the first thing we need to do is to quarantine the infected cattle .
quarantine?
for worms?
until we know what it is .
how long?
how long?
that 's a good question .
as long as it takes .
and secondly , i need to recommend ... that we take everyone's cattle off the host tender meats test feed .
there's worms in the feed?
it 's not in the feed .
so why do we need to take 'em off?
why take them off the feed?
that 's a good question .
because i believe ... the feed is causing the feces to have high concentrations of nitrates ... which are causing common parasites to become more active .
wonderful .
what exactly are these things?
eike i said , we haven't been able to identify them .
i send the ...
i've seen this before .
sometimes , not all the time , but when you introduce ... a new element into an existing ecosystem ... it can have a variety of effects in the various organisms ... that were present within that ecosystem .
come on people .
why does everybody act so surprised about all this?
we've all been having trouble with our cattle for a long time .
nobody wants to say nothing , afraid to piss off the company .
fletcher and his stooges have been pushing us around for a long time .
so we get free feed?
what 's it matter .
when we gotta sell our cattle back to them at cut rate?
see it 's all about greed .
you seriously think that something like this couldn't happen?
they don't care about us , only about making a buck off our backs .
so don't be fools .
there's something bad going on .
give ol 'doc eli here a chance , listen to what he's got to say .
or you can follow these thugs right into the fiery gates of hell .
jacob !
easy , boy .
who you callin 'boy , ees?
you the one that serves the man .
i'm not trying to alarm anyone .
but that 's exactly what you do , isn't it , dr. rudkus?
dr. rudkus can no longer practice veterinary ... in the states of virginia or north carolina .
would you like to tell these people what happened?
this has nothing to do with that .
he found a minor problem in the local water supply .
that 's interesting .
algae causing bacteria to react ... polluting the water supply .
that 's a minor problem to you?
your actions shut down tourism and the pork industry ... costing the state 2oo million dollars in revenue .
the community was sucked dry by a naturally occurring event ... that happens once every fifty years ... and goes quietly away as appeared .
how do you explain that?
all this talk about parasites ... is an attempt by rudkus to generate media exposure for himself ... at expense to host tender meats and host , missouri .
alright folks .
i think we've heard enough .
go on home now .
if you have trouble with your cattle or feed , i'll take care of it .
i'll take care of any problem you got .
at least you tried , doc .
it 's a damn shame .
my great , great granddaddy started host tender in 1887 .
he salted and dried his own beef ... and sold it to the miners heading west to seek their fortune .
the company slowly grew over time .
until today the families of this town rely on us ... for their livelihood .
i'm not trying to threaten anyone's livelihood .
you're not?
no .
do you think we can afford to pay good money for diseased cattle?
who's gonna buy it?
and who's gonna buy food and clothes for all the families of this town?
you , dr. rudkus?
if you think you can come into my home ... a town that i helped build ... and ruin it with your poison ... you are sadly mistaken .
what if i'm not mistaken?
eet me guess .
you're canceling your appointment?
yeah , it 's jacob eong .
what is it?
you'd better get here fast .
she's about to pop .
i'll be right there .
it 's bad .
you better come on .
one minute , she's as right as rain , the next thing .
is this ... is this how you left her?
jacob ... was she like this?
what was that?
i was hoping you could tell me .
doc !
wait , wait , wait .
it 's dead .
this is evidence .
i needed it alive !
it 's better than the alternative now , isn't it?
what the hell is it?
it 's the parasite .
what?
it 's growing ... it 's mutating ... evolving .
oh my .
that 's vertebra .
they'll grow to 4 times this size .
what?
you're telling me this thing ate its way through my cow?
this thing is gonna eat its way through ... anything that it once perceived was a viable host .
us , people .
those cysts , they're in that stream .
guess it ain't evidence no more .
teddy bear , what time are you picking me up?
twenty minutes .
are you ready?
almost .
just gotta put on some lipstick .
what are you wearing?
undies .
0h my god .
you're not !
unbelievable .
save some of that for later .
ted , are you okay?
ted?
ms. anderson .
i thought you might stop by .
what 's patrick's prognosis?
it 's hard to say .
he's stable .
i've never seen anything like this .
mr. odermatt wants him to get the best medical attention .
at any cost .
mrs. whistler .
i'm fletcher odermatt 's attorney .
is there any way we could help you?
my husband's in a coma .
they don't know if or when he'll ever wake up .
i'm sorry .
he sent his condolences .
fletcher doesn't care .
patrick worked there for 1o years ... not once got a raise .
they always talked about 'em .
instead we got picnics and pep talks .
doctor?
patrick whistler just woke up .
how you feeling today?
i don't really know .
next time you decide to take a swim , i have a pool in my backyard ... and we'll put you in there .
we're just going to check your eyes .
there we go .
hey sweetie .
how you feeling?
i want you to come home soon .
what 's happening?
what 's happening?
i don't really feel right .
get her out of here .
code blue .
code blue .
come on .
hang in there patrick .
stay with me .
excuse me .
we're trying to find patrick whistler .
uh , no , sir .
fifth floor .

barbara !
barbara !
where's that thing end up?

what do you think , split up?
you better take one of these .
it ain't gonna bite ya .
just point and squeeze .
point and squeeze .
i can do that .
no , look .
jacob .
did you see it?
i'm pretty sure it went that way .
eet 's get it .
shoot it !
thanks , doc .
thought i was a goner .
yeah , me too .
that 's a scary sound .
hi , dad .
hi , honey .
that 's a nice watch .
you like that?
it belonged to your great granddad .
one day it 'll be yours .
come on .
eet 's wash up .
it 's time for dinner .
all of those?
what 's it do?
i don't think so .
what 's it do at the end?
how's it sound?
who sells these things?
it 's scary .
i guess you like it , don't you?
did you buy it?
i didn't .
who did?
i didn't buy it .
you gave him the money .
i did not buy it .
well that 'll scare him .
see?
is that how it .
do it again .
you hear it?
there it is again .
i'll get it .
i'm aware of the situation .
keneth , it 's under control .
what about him?
he's one of those environmental tree huggers .
if you'll excuse me , i'm in the middle of dinner with my family .
it 's under control kenneth .
i'm handling it .
if anything changes , i'll call you back .
everything alright?
i's fine .
i have to go into the office for a few minutes .
fletcher .
i know .
i'll be back before dessert .
hey tiger , keep it cool .
i can't believe this .
you don't think all these people got one of them things inside them?
that 's exactly what i think .
lf all these people are infected .
it 's about to get real messy .
we'd better get back to my place , pronto .
we need to figure out a way to contain these parasites .
meaning what , doc?
nitrates .
i'm coming with you guys .
what for?
you're part of the problem .
you couldn't possibly think i had anything to do with that !
well then , " aprs vous , mademoiselle .
giant what?
sheriff , it ain't normal .
they're like aliens .
jimmy , you been making that moonshine again?
0f course , but .
jimmy?
damn drunk .
chief?
mrs. harris said something ate her cow from the inside out .
mercury retrograde .
mercury what?
never mind .
fletcher , are you aware the whole town's going nuts?
whatever .
right now i need you to find that vet and lock him up .
vet?
what charges?
i don't care .
make 'em up .
the hospital just called .
patrick whistler's died .
somehow the vet 's tied into it .
and haley , too .
she's on the wrong side of this deal , now .
i'll see what i can do .
but we're getting some pretty crazy calls .
nothing i can do about it .

jimmy says the big worms are back again .
tell him to call an exterminator .

oh god .

it 's my stomach .
take me to the hospital .
who you calling?
nobody .
i just was checking on patrick whistler .
whistler's dead .
oh my god .
i warned you , fletcher .
the drugs are too unstable .
they're not affecting the cattle , but the parasites , too .
milo , relax , will ya?
there's no proof of that .
the proof is in the meat .
eook for yourself .
alright .
all this stuff's gotta be destroyed .
all the files on the experiment , the drugs , all of 'em .
this can't be linked to us .
fletcher , people are dying .
felix warned us .
felix is gone .
and i if you don't want to be gone , too , get to work .
files , research , everything like it never happened .
but we can .
you're in this , too .

i hope nothing out of the ordinary .
you better stop running that mouth .
or someone might tear your tongue out .
are you talking to me?
sheriff?
no , i'm not talking to you .
do you ever wonder if one of those might be inside you right now?
thank you .
i'll deal with you in a minute .
why?
they're not going to stop .
who do you think they'll blame?
host tender meats?
fletcher?
i'll call you right back .
they're gonna blame you if they can .
don't even bother .
you're wasting your breath .
eester here .
there's a bunch of aliens flying around my yard .
they look like kites .
i don't know what they're doing .

you're way past your bedtime .

okay , let 's tuck you in .
sleep tight , baby .
hey , mom?
thanks , mom .
night , baby .
fletcher , i want out .
i know what you're thinking .
but the reward was worth the risk .
just didn't work out .
we'll lay low .
it 'll all blow over and then it 'll all be back to normal .
i can't do it .
i'm leaving .
i see .
i understand .
you don't have the stomach .
felix felt the same way .
he felt bad lying to all the ranchers .
while he was shooting up their cattle with our cocktail .
i'm going to tell you the same thing i told him .
silence is golden .
milo , you didn't believe all those rumors about felix being dead?
you get out of my town .
don't come back .
ever .
are we clear?
mom !
mom !
what?
you'll have to get over this .
you're nearly 1o years old .
it 's time to stop believing in monsters .
see?
no monsters .
you know what this means?
hi , this is madeline fletcher .
i can't take yourcall right now .
you want a cup?
it 's fresh brewed .
uh , my stomach .
this ain't no time for bellyaching now .
what 's the matter with you?
you got the flu?
you okay?
oh my god .
shoot him .
you need to shoot him !
shoot him .
it 's too late !
jacob , shoot him .
it 's too late !
ees , time you started working for the people again .
thanks .
what the hell are these things?
they're just a parasite .
genetically altered feed .
the same feed that mutated the cattle ... ... has now mutated common fluke .
ain't nothing common about 'em .
fletcher ordered the experiments before the trials were approved .
how do we stop 'em?
shootin ''em seems to work fine .
we have a plan , sheriff .
but we're gonna need access to the sewer system .
oh my .
madeline?
madeline .
christopher?
haley , start the engine and release the valve lock .
what 's it look like?
it should be a lever .
alright , that 's it .
jacob , watch out !
your plan seems to be working .
the larva have shifted course .
i'm on my way to the sewers now .
almost there .
alright , doc .
we're over the sewer .
connect the and let her rip .
we better get moving .
they're gonna be on us like flies on buffalo chip .
i'll meet you down there .
ready to do some damage?
always ready , ees .
you two keep spreading these bags of fertilizer .
doc , if i'm not back in two minutes .
you push that red button and blow the hell out of this place .
ready ees?
eet 's go .
eet 's get it on .
careful with that dynamite .
don't worry about me , partner .
i want you to take these sticks of dynamite .
set 'em about forty feet apart on both sides of that tunnel .
think this'll work?
only one way to find out .
be careful out there .
alright .
that 's about two minutes .
what are we gonna do?
i know what we're supposed to do .
eisten .
hang on !
where's the sheriff?
he should be here by now .
we gotta blow this thing .
i'm not going without him .
oh my god .
don't shoot , it 's me !
hold your fire !
take this .
just take it , alright?
you know what to do .
y'all ain't so bad .
eet 's go , ees .
i'm getting too old for this .
come on !
they're coming from both ways .
they got us surrounded .
then let 's find a way out .
right this way , you slimy bastards .
come on , ees , do it .
a little bit more .
come on .
get out through here .
no !
eet go !
it 's too late .
