you may have heard the story of helen , a woman whose beauty launched a thousand ships ... and started the most famous war in history .
you may have heard of that valiant struggle ... that took place beneath the golden walls of troy .
ten years , the best of our lives .
ten thousand men , the best the gods and dreams of glory could have fashioned .
all led by my brother agamemnon , the mightiest of the greeks .
and achilles , who could strike down 10 warriors with one blow .
you may even have heard of paris , who they say betrayed his country and crown ... for love .
but that is not the way it happened .
let me tell you the real story .
i know .
i was there .
kill him !
kill him !
kill him !
kill him !
kill him !
kill him !
kill him !
it's a boy , your highness .
a boy !
you said , " kill him .
kill him .
before any of us knew that it was a boy .
cassandra , have you just had one of your visions , hmm?
tell me !
priam , come see your son .
cassandra , come see your brother alexandros .
look , cassandra , cassandra ...
i know that you see things , and i know that people don't believe you , but i do .
you you saw that it was a baby boy , right?
hmm?
what else did you see?
what else?
if he lives , troy will burn .
take my son to the mountain .
no !
throw him from the highest peak .
no !
do it now !
no !
no !
no , no , no , no !
no !
no !
please !
no !
please !
my son !
no !
gods , do your will .
why would they?
what was it , child?
some foul prophet jealous of your beauty?
never mind .
with me you shall be loved and honored .
i shall name you ...
paris .
paris !
paris , where are you?
paris , come !
time to eat !
ohhh !
i've got goats who fight better than you .
hey , too bad you can't watch your goats as well as your flank .
look !
what?  watch my herd !
stubos !
stubos !
stubos?
stubos?
who's there?
beauty is all ; all is beauty .
victory goes to the strong .
gold rules men .
wealth is power .
paris must choose .
you must judge who of us is fairest .
who are you?
choose me , paris .
i am hera .
i can give you wealth beyond your dreams .
athena brings victory and glory forever .
look into its face , paris .
see what aphrodite gives .
the most beautiful woman in the world
helen .
pollux !
you know you can't go outside the city walls .
father is furious .
come on .
let's get you bathed and dressed .
you can't go to a wedding looking like that .
that big one in front .
is that agamem the one who's to marry our sister?
no .
that's his father , king atreus .
see that one there with the beard?
that's agamemnon .
they say that one day he will rule the entire aegean .
now come on .
let's go .
who's the other one , the young one?
that's his brother , menelaus .
younger by two years .
and not too fond of living in his brother's shadow , so i hear .
come on .
let's get you dressed .
where are they from?
mycenae .
where's that?
never you mind .
theseus , my king , this is bad timing , don't you think?
the greater the challenge .
don't get me wrong .
i love a challenge .
but i just hate to be missing athens in the springtime .
you know how beautiful that is .
if you want beauty , you'll find it right here beyond those walls .
the most beautiful girl in the world is here in sparta .
she's just a child !
i'll ripen her like grapes .
i'll age her like wine .
when she ages just enough , i'll taste her .
well and fine , but not when the greatest warriors in mycenae are just behind those walls .
don't be such a bore .
let's have some fun .
fun?
this is not fun .
fishing is fun .
playing the lute is fun .
swimming in shark infested waters is fun .
committing suicide is not fun !
high king atreus , prince agamemnon , prince menelaus .
we welcome you to sparta .
great tyndareus , made greater by his kindness .
made greater only by his most dutiful and obedient daughter .
may i present the lovely clytemnestra .
clytemnestra ...
i hereby claim you as my wife .
and who is this?
my youngest .
still a child .
an untamed and disrespectful child , i might add .
her name , my lord?
she is helen .
helen .
father , i will take her to her room .
yes , indeed you shall .
as punishment for her disrespect , she will miss the wedding feast .
father in law ,
i see my bride is distressed .
you're quite right .
clytemnestra's little sister is but a child a child who meant no harm .
why not invite her to join us?
well , that sounds fair .
i would be honored to be helen's escort , should the king's legendary kindness permit .
pollux , see that she's properly dressed .
yes , father .
have you ever seen anything like it?
so much trouble .
what's all the fuss about?
don't you understand anything about anything?
you're not a little girl .
you're
you're almost a woman .
what are you doing?
i'm no such thing .
you are .
listen .
listen to me .
get off for a second .
listen !
no !
i won't !
helen !
helen , i love you more than life .
i know it's hard to accept , but someday soon you will marry .
i already know who to .
you do?
i saw him .
where?
in the water .
you'll marry a fish?
a shepherd .
oh , that's likely .
helen !
i will .
i will , pollux .
i had a vision .
i saw his face and and what?
he saw mine .
and one day he'll find me .
i know it .
i just i know it .
good .
good .
meanwhile , you must be ready for kings and princes to seek your hand .
why?
your beauty , your spirit .
it makes men weak .
helen , you have no idea what madness lies in men .
all men , every one .
even you?
there she is .
ah , yes , i see her .
halt there !
would you hold this , please?
thank you .
why are you doing that?
doing what?
casting lots .
and i know what for too .
you've no right .
i'm not some sort of a prize
well done , my friend .
so you get the girl , and i get the horse .
well , i'll just have to find meself another stunningly beautiful princess .
persephone , perhaps .
she's sweet on pomegranates , i heard .
i hate pomegranates .
farewell , my friend .
may the gods be kind .
who are you?
theseus , king of athens .
you don't look like a king .
you'd better get used to me .
i'm going to marry you .
i think you've got me confused with my sister .
i'm not the daughter of tyndareus who does what anybody says .
you're not the daughter of tyndareus at all .
of course i am .
you think my mother found me under a cabbage leaf?
some say that .
i don't .
you're queen leda's daughter , all right .
there's no mistaking that face .
i'm my father's daughter too .
you'd have to be .
that's the way it works .
tyndareus is my father .
they never told you anything at all , did they?
told me what?
what do you think happened to your mother?
she died .
why?
because of me .
i made her sick .
how?
do you know?
tyndareus told you you killed your mother?
he didn't have to say it .
he can't look at me .
your mother took her own life , helen .
she leapt from the west wall of the palace .
no .
you lie .
why would she?
she was raped .
because she was beautiful?
yeah .
is that what you intend with me?
what?
rape .
i don't rape children .
or are you a woman?
no .
no .
no .
well , when you are , we'll be good friends .
you will be fine .
you can't take away our best stock .
you should be honored .
honored?
that you steal away our livelihood?
you'll be compensated .
fairly .
fairly compensated .
compensated doesn't fill our cows with seed .
com pensation doesn't give us meat !
paris , where are you?
paris !
they're taking your bull !
that's the property of the king of troy !
no , he's not !
he's mine !
i raised him !
hold it !  leave him !
leave my son alone !
any other objections?
he will be the grand prize in king priam's games .
if you wish to negotiate with the winner , you will find him there .
tell me the truth about my mother .
i need to know .
please .
when it happened , tyndareus was away in egypt .
when she began to show a couple of months later , he'd been gone for half a year .
so the kingdom watched her belly swell month after month .
she was disgraced .
she had no husband beside her .
she waited till she had you , then
had me?
it was me?
no !
helen , no !
there are wolves !
do i look like her?
well , you're younger ... and dirtier .
when you grow up , if you grow up and don't make me wring your neck , you'll be even more breathtaking .
who was it?
who did it?
tell me who .
helen , you're the daughter of the greatest god .
zeus is your father .
that's why your beauty will never be matched .
that's why no man will ever resist it .
you resisted me .
well ... not without great effort .
let me be your friend .
i think you could do with one .
i must always know the truth .
always .
i'm going to troy .
i'll get our bull back .
troy is no place for people like us .
i'm going .
no .
they'll hurt you .
if these ribs aren't broken , they will be with one more blow .
they can't treat us like that , like we're nothing .
i'll bring back what's ours .
there's no point .
there is ... when i win it .
and so paris came to troy .
it was the richest city in the world .
into it were brought silks from asia , spices from arabia , rare woods from africa .
a feast for the eyes .
both of them .
huh?
from its strategic harbor , with its massive walls ,
troy controlled all trade north and south of the aegean .
and paris would control troy's fate ... more than he could know .
hector !
hector !
hector !
hector !
you here to sign up?
what's your name?
paris .
of?
as in where from?
mount ida .
all right .
where's your cuirass?
my what?
breastplate .
no?
what about a helmet?
any kind of armor?
boy !
fetch me some of that old armor .
how about your cudgel?
i could use this .
look here , lad , you can't win , but at least you have to put on a good show .
go ahead , choose one .
you'll find some better than others .
why can't i win?
no one ever beats prince hector .
leave your knife on the rack .
hey , shepherd boy !
the hero from mt .
ida !
ah , the king's thief .
you're on , shepherd .
with your friend .
go !
go , go !
paris of mt .
ida meets pres byterian , commander of the guard !
the winner is paris of mt .
ida .
need better armor .
this old hittite stuff is junk .
is it bad?
it's nothing .
an old wound .
you shouldn't be fighting .
i have to .
oh , really?
and why is that?
i don't like thieves sent by kings ... to steal my livestock for their games and amusement .
the bull?
my bull .
ah .
my father's games must be fair .
i can't fight a wounded man .
the rules are clear , my lord .
you must .
paris .
son .
paris of mt .
ida will fight damien of argos .
you're hurt .
i'll be fine .
your ribs .
you can't .
father , i'll be fine .
the winner is paris of mt .
ida !
paris , you must stop this .
i've seen these crush a man's head .
paris , you must never mind what happened .
we'll survive without our bull .
paris , you're my only child .
i beg you , come home .
you raised me to be strong , to be loyal , to defend what i believe in .
paris of mt .
ida ... will fight hideus of seronea .
i love you , father .
paris of mt .
ida !
i can't watch my only son get killed .
he's not your son .
begone , old shepherd .
wait .
he's my father .
no , paris , don't .
it's princess cassandra .
alexandros .
my name is paris .
you should be dead .
give me a minute .
the final match !
prince hector of troy ... against paris of mt .
ida !
no !
you must kill him .
these are just games , cassandra .
you don't understand !
look , he is good , but he's only a shepherd .
he's alexandros .
he's baby alexandros !
if you love your family , honor troy , you must destroy him .
you don't intend to fight me?
i'll fight you the way i live , not troy's way .
do you know how to use a dagger , shepherd?
can't stop wolves with sticks .
what is he doing?
then use it .
kill him !
what?
come on !
kill him !
kill him !
kill him !
kill him !
kill him !
alexandros?
kill him !
do you surrender?
i am prepared to die .
i don't want your life !
does prince hector surrender?
does troy surrender?
paris of mt .
ida !
approach , paris of mt .
ida .
don't look at him , mother .
alexandros?
are you alexandros?
my name is paris .
father , what are you doing?
we have our bull .
we can go home .
you are home .
noble king priam , if someone must be punished , let it be me .
my son?
there is no doubt , my queen .
i found him on the mountain .
my darling , darling child .
shepherd ... you've done well .
you have brought home our son .
welcome home ...
prince paris of troy !
the prophecy has been fulfilled .
what prophecy?
because you live , we all must die .
how was the ride?
ohh .
mount hymettus honey .
best in the world .
how do you know it's the best?
well , i suppose i don't .
well , then there's always a chance ... you might find something better .
no .
i want to love .
well , you will someday .
i'm ready now .
you're young .
i'm a woman .
someday , someplace you'll find someone better .
someone worthier .
when you do , neither the gods 'will nor the earth's turning ... will keep you from him .
that's how i feel about you .
but , helen , this has just been well , a kind of practice .
someday you'll know the difference .
you always said that we'd marry .
helen .
hey .
pollux !
shh .
quiet .
why are you here?
we finally found you .
you're safe now .
aah !
leave him !
let me go !
let me go !
pollux , make them stop !
get her out of here !
don't let her see this !
it will warm her heart !
no , pollux !
you don't understand !
get off me !
aah !
pollux , if you love me , hear me !
let me go !
no !
it's all right , helen !
it's a fair price , and i gladly pay it .
no !
no !
pollux !
no !
with the death of pollux , tyndareus had no heir .
the great kings of the aegean ... were drawn to sparta like moths to the flame .
odysseus , king of ithaca , remembers the fallen pollux ... and offers his heart to the great king tyndareus .
achilles brings greetings from the myrmidons ... who stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of sparta ... to defend the honor of sparta ... and to revenge the blood of the great king tyndareus .
to die for a woman it's hard to imagine such weakness .
you cannot comment .
you have not seen her .
i don't need to .
you afraid to try?
i'm afraid of nothing .
there .
you shed no tears .
by your actions , you have left me without love or hope ... and sparta without its future king , and you show no grief .
it should have been you who died .
is there any among you who will take this cursed woman?
is there any among you ... who wishes their home devastated , his country brought to ruin , his heart broken beyond repair?
i leave her to you .
leave her !
tyndareus is right .
she'll bring her husband more trouble than he could ever imagine .
the path to her bed is strewn with ash and death .
and yet is there not one man 'round this table who does not want her?
do you suggest that every king here draw his sword against the other?
no .
of course not .
that would be
what he wants is to have her all to himself .
isn't that right , little brother?
in truth , if we raise our swords at all , it should be together and pointed in the same direction .
toward riches in byzantium .
or perseus .
if we unite , we can conquer anything at all .
any creature , any nation .
well spoken , agamemnon , but you control no army .
perhaps i should tell you , brothers , that as we speak ... our father , the clear eyed atreus , lies alone , speaking only with the gods .
in a matter of days they will take him , and i will return to the citadel at mycenae .
then let us greet you now as our new high king mighty agamemnon of mycenae .
agamemnon !
agamemnon !
can we agree to unite in time of war?
what do you say , odysseus?
i have a family .
i'd rather plow a field and sow it with salt than go to war .
and you , achilles?
some of us may prefer a long and quiet life at home .
i , for one , would live it short ... if i knew i could die with a taste of glory on my lips .
you will have it short if one of us takes helen .
and yet , perhaps this is the way that we can unite as agamemnon wishes .
good odysseus , the wisest of us all .
tell us , a wise one , what do you propose?
two things .
first , we swear an oath .
what sort of oath?
whoever takes helen ... can trust that we will defend that man's sole right to her with our lives .
the rest must be content to admire her from afar .
and second?
we cast lots .
the winner takes the bride .
never !
who
what gives you the right to agree on such a thing?
the right of one man to one vote .
who in the world has ever heard of that?
there is no such thing .
then we begin here .
who swears the oath?
agamemnon , as we two are the only ones who are married , how do you suggest we cast the lots?
given this noble assemblage ,
i would say our seals .
closest to the jar ... may claim his bride .
menelaus .
what say you , my brother?
i say the gods have spoken .
and each man here would be wise to keep his oath ... or face the everlasting wrath of mount olympus .
your daughter is so lovely .
she reminds me of you .
so long ago .
iphigenia , come .
say good night to your aunt .
have you been bouncing?
ohh !
give your aunt a kiss .
go to bed .
quickly .
making a child so sweet might be reason enough to live .
you have many reasons , helen .
tomorrow you will marry my husband's brother .
we'll be sisters and sisters in law both .
yes .
they are hard men .
but it is possible to love them .
paris?
father asked to see you .
hmph .
he's sending you to sparta .
why?
because he wants you to take a message to the new king menelaus , younger brother of high king agamemnon of mycenae .
high king?
some sort of supreme ruler , is he?
that's right .
and now he's talking more against troy .
why?
because we control access to the silks and spices of byzantium .
what?
i just can't believe people go to war over nutmeg .
well , they do , paris , and you'd better get used to it .
where is he now , this high king of theirs?
don't know .
agamemnon's in sparta for the funeral of tyndareus and the crowning of menelaus , and when i get there it will appear that i've been sent to drive a wedge ... between the brothers , who will then kill me and put my head on a spike .
then troy will be rid of me , cassandra will be redeemed ... and you can get back to being the sole heir to the throne .
am i close?
you're being a fool .
look me in the eye and say that .
look me in the eye .
brother , if the gods have divined it , so be it .
such strong winds , my lord .
the gods must have hurried us here .
yes , it would seem .
they must favor your mission .
i wouldn't count on it .
oh .
helen , i'm the obedient wife , but even i will tell you ... he's taken this oath too far .
when you were a child and father punished you , you would always come back fighting .
why aren't you fighting now?
i've caused such grief and destruction .
helen , you did not ask to be kidnapped .
nor rescued , for that matter .
it's not your fault .
it's paris of troy .
bring him here .
you don't know .
why do you have to do this?
menelaus commands it .
i don't do it for agamemnon .
ten thousand men have sworn their lives ... to defend the right of menelaus to have me .
agamemnon believes the king ... should seek proof of my worth .
how can you let them treat you like this?
they can look all they want , but they'll never see me .
truly magnificent .
breathtaking .
wait !
wait !
wait !
we come in peace !
i'll be fine .
he seeks peace , my brother .
there is no peace with troy .
he bears a letter from their king .
to whom is it addressed?
do not shame me , brother .
troy seeks to align with sparta ... and sparta alone .
they have sent him to drive a wedge between us .
we can let nothing divide the blood of the house of atreus .
but not now .
not here .
let him remain , freely speaking ... until we know enough of troy to find a way inside its golden walls .
the weight of a crown has made my little brother wise beyond my expectations .
catch me , theseus .
catch me , pollux .
you .
i've seen you .
in the pool .
you saw too .
i've come for you .
it's too late .
the gods decree it .
aphrodite herself .
then the gods torment me .
how can you say that?
when i'm there with them , i feel nothing .
naked in front of a hundred kings nothing .
but then tonight , when i saw you , something began to tear away my shield , to expose the one thing that i cannot endure .
hope .
have it now .
i love you .
loving me kills people .
it destroys families , causes such grief you cannot imagine .
i've imagined you all these years .
and now i've found you , i cannot let you go .
i will never leave you .
the day i do is the day i die .
go away .
leave me .
you must never see me again .
you consort with a trojan , an enemy of sparta .
do you want to be put to death?
yes , i do !
what's happened to you?
i've become visible .
you're not making sense about anything .
you meet some envoy , and before you no !
i didn't just meet him .
i've loved him for years , before you even married agamemnon .
that can't be possible .
it's not true , is it?
what's going to happen?
i heard agamemnon and menelaus talk of troy .
and?
tomorrow they will ask the envoy about his city .
when agamemnon has learned all he needs to know , we will return to mycenae and menelaus
will kill him .
you did well tonight .
the kings were pleased .
until the envoy arrived .
yes .
why is he here?
that makes no matter .
did he come bearing tribute?
there is no tribute that compares with you .
you are a generous man .
no , i'm a lucky man .
you mean stealing's not a crime in sparta?
being caught is the crime , always .
there was a boy young , no more than 10 .
he stole a fox and hid it under his cloak .
he died while being questioned , and when they removed his cloak ... they found he'd let the fox gnaw through his body rather than reveal his theft .
such boys make good soldiers .
yes , they do .
we train them from the age of seven .
ours learn to tame horses from a young age .
you must visit our stables whilst you are here .
they're not as grand as your own , i'm sure .
i have heard people say ... that the walls of troy are made of gold .
is this really true?
no .
but they are beautiful .
iphigenia , where are you?
perhaps one day i will see the walls of troy for myself .
ah !
i found you !
no man can possess all he desires .
calchas !
my lord?
my wife tells me ... that no man can claim the world .
what say the gods?
olympus favors the high king ... who one day will rule the entire aegean .
you may bear my children , but never again will you interfere with my affairs .
is that understood?
come with me !
you !
and you !
let's go !
quiet !
let's go !
i thought we were here to make peace .
we like making peace .
yes .
a lot .
the greeks have other ideas .
what sort of ideas?
like cut off our heads , put them on pikes , let birds eat our eyes .
that sort of thing .
prince paris of troy , my king bids you a fond good night .
aah !
man those oars !
get to the turret !
go now .
you're free .
without you?
you have my love .
without you i have nothing .
my lord !
my lord !
the tide begins to turn !
menelaus is shamed , but he fears to harm me .
now go .
i beg you !
please go !
my lord !
the wind is up !
please .
please .
make way , men !
ready oars !
ready?
pull !
ready?
pull !
ready?
pull !
no .
hold oars !
make way !
what have we done?
ohh !
well fought , croesus .
achilles !
achilles !
your news precedes you .
as the gods are my witness , i will kill that man .
you can be sure of it .
you brought dishonor on yourself and shame to the house of atreus .
i'll have the trojan's head on a spike !
not without my help .
ah , yes .
well , as always , i must bear the weight of your shadow .
you're a smudge on history's ledger , menelaus , but you are my brother .
what's more , the kings of the aegean have sworn an oath .
to unite , as i recall .
the oath did not place you in command of me , of my army , or any other
do not incur my wrath , little brother .
do not .
these are my terms .
you may have the trojan ... and your whore .
i will take troy .
you will share no spoils not a scrap of broken clay , not an ingot of their basest metal .
agreed?
i am your brother do you agree?
what makes you think the kings will unite behind you?
the gods have written it .
and you know for certain they favor you in this?
for certain !
save him !
swim , clemyetus !
throw me the line !
reach for me !
aah !
two months .
the wind remains against us .
the men grow impatient !
i grow impatient , achilles .
calchas .
my lord .
when will the winds blow with us?
what say the gods?
speak , seer .
what must i do?
a terrible thing .
tell me .
i command you .
the goddess artemis asks for your daughter .
in trade for fair wind ,
artemis demands your daughter's life ... here , on this altar .
and this ... will satisfy the goddess?
but you must hold the knife .
the gods demand it .
of course they do .
the winds will soon be with us .
pitch !
oh !
okay , ready?
ready?
