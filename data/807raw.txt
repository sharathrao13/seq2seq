mozart !
mozart !
forgive your assassin !
i confess , i killed you !
s " , i killed you , mozart .
mozart , " piet " !
forgive your assassin !
forgive me , mozart !
signore salieri , open the door , be good now !
signore " , we have something special for you .
something you're going to love .
is that good !
signore " , believe me ... ... this is the most delicious thing i ever ate in my life !
really , you don't know what you're miss ...
all right , that's enough !
open the door .
signore " , if you don't open this door ... ... we're gonna leave nothing for you .
and i'm never gonna come see you again !
good morning , father .
herr salieri?
leave me alone .
i cannot leave alone a soul in pain .
do you know who i am?
that makes no difference .
all men are equal in god's eyes .
are they?
offer me your confession .
i can offer you god's forgiveness .
how well are you trained in music?
i know a little .
i studied it in my youth .
where?
here in vienna .
then you must know this .
i can't say that i do .
what is it?
it was a very popular tune in its day .
i wrote it .
here , how about this?
this one brought down the house when we played it .
well?
i regret it is not too familiar .
can you recall no melody of mine?
i was the most famous composer in europe .
i wrote 40 operas alone .
here !
what about this one?
yes , i know that !
that's charming !
i'm sorry , i didn't know you wrote that .
i didn't .
that was mozart .
wolfgang ... ... amadeus mozart .
the man you accuse yourself of killing .
you've heard that?
is it true?
for god's sake , my son ... ... if you have something to confess , do it now .
give yourself some peace .
he ... ... was my idol .
mozart .
i can't think of a time when i didn't know his name .
i was playing games ... ... when he was playing music for kings and emperors .
even the pope in rome .
i admit , i was jealous ... ... when i heard the tales they told about him .
not of the brilliant little prodigy ... ... but of his father , who had taught him everything .
my father , he did not care for music .
when i told him ... ... how i wished i could be like mozart ... ... he would say , " why?
do you want to be a trained monkey?
you'd like me to drag you around , doing tricks like a circus freak?
how could i tell him ... ... what music meant to me?
while my father prayed earnestly to god ... ... to protect commerce ... ...
i would offer up ... ... secretly ... ... the proudest prayer a boy could think of .
lord , make me a great composer .
let me celebrate your glory through music ... ... and be celebrated myself .
make me famous through the world .
make me immortal .
after i die ... ... let people speak my name with love for what i wrote .
in return ... ... i will give you my chastity ... ... my industry ... ... my deepest humility , every hour of my life .
amen .
and do you know what happened?
a miracle !
my life changed forever .
i knew god had arranged it all .
that was obvious .
one minute i was a frustrated boy ... ... in an obscure little town .
the next i was here ... ... in vienna , city of musicians ... ... and emperor joseph , the musical king .
in a few years , i was his court composer .
isn't that incredible?
every night i sat with the emperor of austria ... ... playing duets with him ... ... correcting the royal sight reading .
actually , the man had no ear at all .
but what did it matter?
he adored my music .
tell me ...
if you had been me ... ... wouldn't you have thought god had accepted your vow?
and believe me , i honored it .
i was a model of virtue .
i kept my hands off women .
i worked hours every day teaching students , many for free !
sitting on endless committees to help poor musicians .
work , that was all my life .
and it was wonderful .
everybody liked me .
i liked myself .
until he came .
he came to vienna to play some of his music ... ... at the residence of the prince archbishop of salzburg .
eagerly , i went there to seek him out .
that night ... ... changed my life .
as i wandered through the salon ... ...
i played a little game with myself .
this man had written his first concerto at the age of 4 ... ... his first symphony at 7 , a full scale opera at 12 !
did it show?
is talent like that ... ... written on the face?
which one of them ... ... could he be?
mozart is not here .
stop it !
i am .
stop it !
i am stopping it .
i am !
i'm stopping it .
slowly .
there .
you see?
i've stopped .
now we're going back .
no !
yes !
you don't know where you are .
here , everything goes backwards .
people walk and dance and sing and even talk backwards .
that's stupid .
why?
people fart backwards .
ssa ym ssik !
ssa ym ssik !
yes , you are .
you are very sick .
no !
say it backwards , shitwit !
ssa ym ssik .
ssik , kiss .
ym , my .
ssa .
kiss my ass .
em yrram !
i'm not playing !
say it , it's serious .
it's very serious .
yrram .
marry me .
i'm not gonna marry you .
you're a fiend .
uoy evol i tub .
tub .
but i ... ... love ...
but i love you?
tihs ym tae .
what?
eat .
eat .
ym , my .
my .
tihs .
eat my shit .
you filthy fiend !
you filthy ... !
my music .
they've started without me .
that was mozart !
that giggling , dirty creature i'd just seen crawling on the floor .
i think that went well , don't you?
indeed .
the viennese know good music , don't you think?
certainly .
your grace .
ah , mozart .
why?
why what , sir?
why do i have to be humiliated in front of my guests ... ... by one of my own servants?
the more license i allow you , the more you take .
if his grace is not satisfied , he can dismiss me .
i wish you to return immediately to salzburg .
your father is waiting for you there .
no , your grace !
i would prefer you dismissed me .
it's obvious i don't satisfy .
i have no intention of dismissing you .
you will remain in my service ... ... and learn your place .
on the page it looked ...
nothing !
the beginning simple , almost comic .
just a pulse .
bassoons , basset horns ... ... like a rusty squeezebox .
and then , suddenly ... ... high above it ... ... an oboe .
a single note , hanging there , unwavering .
until ... ... a clarinet took it over ... ... sweetened it into a phrase of such delight .
this was no composition by a performing monkey .
this was a music i had never heard .
filled with such longing , such unfulfillable longing .
it seemed to me i was hearing the voice of god .
excuse me .
but why?
why would god choose an obscene child to be his instrument?
it was not to be believed .
this piece had to be an accident .
it had to be .
it better be .
how good is he , this mozart?
he's remarkable , majesty .
i heard an extraordinary opera of his last month .
idomeneo , king of crete .
that?
a tiresome piece .
i heard it too .
tiresome?
a young man trying to impress beyond his abilities .
too much spice .
too many notes .
majesty ... ... it was the most promising work i've heard in years .
then , we should make some effort to acquire him .
we could use a good german composer in vienna , surely?
i'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer .
say ... ... an opera in german for our national theater .
excellent , sire !
but not german .
i beg , your majesty .
italian is the proper language for opera .
all educated people agree on that .
what do you think , chamberlain?
in my opinion , it's time we had a piece in our own language .
plain german for plain people .
kapellmeister?
majesty ... ... i must agree with " herr direttore " .
german is ... ... too brute for singing .
court composer ... ... what do you think?
i think it's an interesting notion to keep mozart in vienna .
it should infuriate the archbishop ... ... if that is your majesty's intention .
you are " cattivo " , court composer .
i want to meet this young man .
arrange a pleasant welcome for him .
well , there it is !
this is a beautiful wig for you .
it looks so marvelous and i love it .
the other one .
here is the other one .
i think you will love it .
here's the third one .
so?
here we go .
how do you like it?
they're all so beautiful !
why don't i have three heads?
this is funny !
three heads !
gentlemen .
good morning .
morning , your majesty .
what do you have for me today?
your majesty , " herr mozart " .
yes , what about him?
he's here .
well , there it is .
good !
i hope you won't find it improper , but i've written a march in his honor .
what a charming idea , court composer .
may i see?
just a ...
just a trifle , of course .
may i try it?
let's have some fun .
delightful , court composer !
may i play it when he comes in?
you do me too much honor .
bring in " herr mozart " .
but slowly .
i need a minute to practice .
good , continue .
g , majesty .
excellent !
good , majesty .
continue .
very good .
very good , majesty .
tempo !
up .
lightly , then strongly !
it's a march , majesty .
again .
bravo , majesty !
gentlemen , please .
a little less enthusiasm , i beg you .
no , please .
it's not a holy relic .
you know , we have met before .
in this very room .
you don't recall .
you were only 6 .
he was giving a delightful concert !
as he got off the stool , he fell .
my sister antoinette helped him up .
know what he did?
he jumped into her arms and said , " will you marry me?
yes or no?
you know all these gentlemen .
the baron van swieten .
i'm a great admirer of yours .
thank you .
kapellmeister bonno .
my pleasure .
the director of opera , count orsini rosenberg .
sir , yes .
the honor is mine , absolutely !
here is our illustrious court composer ... ... maestro salieri .
at last , such immense joy !
i know your work well .
you know , i composed some variations on a melody of yours .
really?
which one?
" mio caro adone .
i'm flattered .
a funny tune , but it yielded good things .
and now he has returned the compliment .
herr salieri " composed this little march for you .
really?
well , there it is .
down to business .
we're going to commission an opera from you .
what do you say?
did we vote in the end for german or italian?
sire , if you remember , we did finally incline to italian .
did we?
i don't think it was really decided , your majesty .
german .
please let it be german .
why so?
because i've already found the most wonderful libretto .
have i seen it?
i don't think you have , " herr direktor " .
it's quite new .
i'll show it to you immediately .
i think you'd better .
well ... ... tell us about it .
tell us the story .
well , it's quite amusing , majesty .
it's set ...
the whole thing is set in a ...
yes?
where?
in a harem , majesty .
in a seraglio .
you mean in turkey?
yes , exactly .
then why especially does it have to be in german?
it doesn't , especially .
it could be in turkish if you really want .
no , my dear fellow , the language is not finally the point .
do you really think that subject is appropriate for a national theater?
why not?
it's charming .
i mean , i won't actually show concubines exposing their ...
it's not indecent .
it's highly moral , majesty .
it's full of proper german virtues .
excuse me , majesty , but what do you think these could be?
being a foreigner , i'd love to learn .
well , tell him , mozart .
name us a german virtue .
love , sire .
oh , love !
of course , in italy we know nothing about love .
no , i don't think you do .
watching italian opera , all those male sopranos screeching ... ... stupid , fat couples rolling their eyes about .
that's not love .
it's rubbish !
majesty , you choose the language .
i'll set it to the finest music ever offered a monarch .
well , there it is .
let it be german .
this is yours .
keep it .
it's already here in my head .
what?
on one hearing only?
i think so , sire .
yes .
show us .
the rest is just the same , isn't it?
that doesn't really work , does it?
did you try ...?
shouldn't it be a bit more ...?
or this?
this .
yes .
better?
what do you think?
grazie , signore .
all i ever wanted was to sing to god .
he gave me that longing ... ... and then made me mute .
why?
tell me that .
if he didn't want me to praise him with music ... ... why implant the desire ... ... like a lust in my body?
and then deny me the talent?
madame cavalieri is here for her lesson , sir .
maestro .
well ...?
how do you like it?
it's turkish .
my hairdresser said everything this year's going to be turkish .
does he?
what else did he tell you today?
come , come !
give me some gossip .
well , i heard you met " herr mozart " .
news travels fast in vienna .
and he's been commissioned to write an opera .
is it true?
yes .
is there a part in it for me?
no .
how do you know?
do you know where it's set , my dear?
where?
in a harem .
what's that?
a brothel .
come .
let's begin .
what does he look like?
mozart?
you might be disappointed .
why?
looks and talent don't always go together , katerina .
looks don't concern me , maestro .
only talent interests a woman of taste .
shall we continue?
there she was .
i don't know where they met or how .
there she stood !
on stage , for all to see .
showing off like the greedy songbird she was .
ten minutes of ghastly scales .
arpeggios !
whizzing up and down like fireworks at a fairground .
understand , i was in love with the girl .
or at least in lust .
and i swear to you , i never laid a finger on her .
all the same , i couldn't bear to think of anyone else touching her .
least of all , " the creature " .
brava , madame !
you are an ornament to our stage .
your majesty .
well , " herr mozart " .
a good effort .
well , decidedly that .
an excellent effort !
you have shown us something ... ... quite new tonight .
it is new .
it is , isn't it , sire?
yes , indeed .
so then , you liked it?
you really liked it , sire?
well , of course i did !
it's very good !
of course , now and then , just now and then ... ... it seemed a touch ...
what do you mean , sire?
well , i mean , occasionally , it seems to have ...
how shall one say ...?
how shall one say , " direktor "?
too many notes , majesty?
exactly .
very well put .
too many notes .
i don't understand .
there are just as many notes as i required , neither more nor less .
my dear fellow , there are in fact ... ... only so many notes the ear can hear in an evening .
i think i'm right in saying that , aren't i , court composer?
yes .
on the whole , yes , majesty .
this is absurd !
young man , don't take it too hard .
your work is ingenious .
it's quality work .
and there are simply too many notes .
just cut a few and it'll be perfect .
which few did you have in mind?
wolfgang !
wolfgang , my dear !
wolfgang !
majesty , this is " frau weber " .
she's my landlady .
enchanted , madame .
sire , such an honor !
this is my dear daughter , constanze .
she's the fiance of " herr mozart " .
really?
how charming .
please .
well ... ... when do you marry?
we haven't exactly received my father's consent yet .
not entirely .
not altogether .
excuse me , but how old are you?
26 .
my advice is for you to marry this charming young lady ... ... and stay with us in vienna .
you see?
i told him that , but he won't listen to me .
your majesty , you give such wonderful ... ... such royal advice .
may i ...?
well , there it is .
wolfie , will you get some water?
will you get some water , please?
wolfie , get some water !
excuse me .
excuse me .
did you know?
what?
the marriage .
what does it matter to you?
nothing .
he can marry who he pleases , i don't give a damn .
how was i?
you were sublime .
and what did you think of the music?
extremely clever .
katerina , i ...
excuse me .
is that woman still lying on the floor?
no , she's fine .
oh , i'm so relieved .
dear mozart , my sincere congratulations .
did you like it then?
how could i not?
it's the best music in vienna today , don't you agree?
she must be dazzling in bed .
i assume she's the virtuoso in that department .
no other reason why you'd marry someone like that .
come in .
excuse me .
wolfie , mom isn't feeling very well .
can we go home?
yes .
no , no , no .
you can't take him away now .
this is his night .
won't you introduce us , wolfgang?
excuse us , " frulein " .
good night , " signore " .
at that moment i knew , beyond any doubt ... ... he'd had her .
the creature had had my darling girl .
it was incomprehensible !
what was god up to?
was it possible i was being tested?
was god expecting me to offer forgiveness ... ... in the face of every offense?
no matter how painful?
it's very possible .
but why him?
why choose mozart to teach me lessons in humility?
my heart was filling up ... ... with such hatred for that little man .
for the first time in my life , i began to know ... ... really ... ... violent thoughts .
every day , sometimes for hours , i would pray .
lord ... ... please ... ... send him away ... ... back to salzburg .
for his sake ... ... as well as mine .
no !
i won't have him back .
but , your grace ...
your son is an unprincipled , spoiled , conceited brat !
yes , sir ... ... that is the truth .
but don't blame him .
the fault is mine , entirely .
i was too indulgent with him .
please , your grace?
give him one more chance?
you have leave to try .
god bless , your grace !
i thank your grace .
i thank you !
i write to you with urgent news .
i'm coming to vienna .
take no further steps towards marriage until we meet .
as you honor the father who has devoted his life to yours ... ... do as i bid , and await my coming .
i now join you in the holy bonds of matrimony .
those whom god hath joined together ... ... let no man put asunder .
you say vienna is the musicians 'city .
to conquer here is to conquer europe .
with my wife i can do it .
one day , when i'm wealthy ... ... you'll live with us , and we'll be so happy .
good morning .
this is my niece , princess elizabeth .
your highness .
she's asked me to recommend a music instructor .
i've come up with an excellent idea .
your majesty !
it would be such a tremendous honor !
i was thinking of " herr mozart " .
what is your view?
it's an interesting idea , majesty , but ...
yes?
my concern is to protect you ... ... from any hint of favoritism .
favoritism .
what is this?
what is what?
why must i submit samples of my work to a committee to teach a girl?
because his majesty wishes it .
is the emperor angry with me?
quite the contrary .
then why not appoint me to the post?
you are not the only composer in vienna .
no .
but i'm the best .
mozart .
a little modesty might suit you better .
who is on this committee?
kapellmeister bonno , count orsini rosenberg and salieri .
naturally , the italians !
of course , always the italians !
they're all musical idiots !
and you want them to judge my music?
young man ... ... the issue is quite simple .
if you want this position ... ... you must submit your stuff , along with all your colleagues .
must i?
well , i won't .
how are we supposed to live?
do you want me to beg on the streets?
don't be stupid .
all they want to see is your work .
shit .
what's wrong with that?
shut up !
just shut up .
one royal pupil , and all of vienna will come flocking .
they'll come anyway .
no , they won't .
they love me here .
i know how things work in this city .
you know everything , don't you?
yes?
excuse me , sir .
a lady insists on talking to you .
who?
she didn't say , but she says it's urgent .
excuse me , my dear .
your excellency .
how can i help you?
frau mozart?
i've come on behalf of my husband .
i brought samples of his work so he can be considered for the appointment .
how charming , but why did he not come himself?
well , he's terribly busy , sir .
i understand .
i will look at them the moment i can .
it will be an honor .
please give him my warmest regards .
would it be too much trouble to ask you to look at them now?
while i wait .
i'm afraid i'm not at leisure ... ... this precise moment .
leave them with me .
i assure you , they will be safe .
i really cannot do that , sir .
you see , he doesn't know i'm here .
then he didn't send you?
no , sir .
this was my own idea .
i see .
sir , we're desperate .
we really need this job .
my husband spends far more than he can ever earn .
i don't mean that he's lazy , because he works all day long .
it's just that he's not practical .
money simply slips through his fingers .
it's ridiculous .
let me offer you some refreshment .
do you know what these are?
capezzoli di venere " !
nipples of venus .
they're roman chestnuts in brandied sugar .
try one .
go on , try one !
they're quite surprising .
they're wonderful !
thank you very much , your excellency .
don't keep calling me that .
keeps me at such a distance .
i wasn't born a court composer , you know .
i'm from a small town .
just like your husband .
are you sure you can't ... ... leave this and come back again?
it's very tempting , sir .
but it's impossible , i'm afraid .
he'd be frantic if he knew they were missing .
you see , they're all originals .
originals?
yes , sir .
he doesn't make copies .
these ... ... are originals?
astounding !
it was actually ...
it was beyond belief .
these were first and only ... ... drafts of music .
but they showed no corrections of any kind .
not one .
he had simply written down music ... ... already finished in his head .
page after page of it .
as if he were just taking dictation .
and music ... ... finished as no music is ever finished .
displace one note ... ... and there would be diminishment .
displace one phrase , and the structure would fall .
it was clear to me ... ... that sound i had heard in the archbishop's palace ... ... had been no accident .
here again was the very voice of god .
i was staring through the cage ... ... of those meticulous ink strokes ... ... at an absolute beauty .
is it not good?
it is miraculous .
yes , he's very proud of his work .
so you will help us?
i dine with the emperor tomorrow evening .
one word from me and the post is his .
thank you , your excellency !
thank you !
come back tonight .
tonight?
alone .
what for?
some service deserves service in return .
no?
what do you mean?
isn't it obvious?
it's a post all vienna seeks .
if you wish it for your husband , come tonight .
i'm a married woman , sir .
then don't .
it's up to you .
and not to be vague , that is the price .
there is no god of mercy , father .
just a god of torture .
evening came .
i sat there , not knowing whether she would return or not .
i prayed as i had never prayed before .
dear god ... ... enter me now .
fill me with one piece of true music .
one piece with your breath in it , so i know that you love me .
show me one sign of your favor , and i will show mine to mozart .
i will get him the royal position .
enter me .
please .
please !
yes?
that lady is back , sir .
show her in .
well?
i'm here .
my husband has gone to a concert .
he didn't think i would enjoy it .
well , where shall we go?
should we stay here?
well ...
do you still want to look at these?
or don't we need to bother anymore?
suppose we don't , really .
show this woman out .
stanzi .
stanzi .
what is it?
what's the matter?
tell me .
tell me .
i love you .
i love you .
from now on , we are enemies .
you and i.
because you choose for your instrument ... ... a boastful , lustful , smutty , infantile boy ... ... and give me for reward only the ability to recognize the incarnation .
because you are unjust ... ... unfair ... ... unkind ... ...
i will block you .
i swear it .
i will hinder and harm your creature on earth ... ... as far as i am able .
i don't like to talk against a fellow musician .
of course not .
i have to tell you .
mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies .
really?
one of my own pupils , a very young singer ... ... maria theresa paradis ... ... told me she was ...
well ...
well , what?
molested , majesty .
twice , in the course of the same lesson .
there is a " herr mozart " waiting for you in the salon .
whom did they choose?
herr zummer .
herr zummer?
but the man's a fool !
he's a total mediocrity .
no , no .
he has yet to achieve mediocrity .
i can't lose this post .
i simply can't .
excellency , please .
let's go to the palace .
you can talk to the emperor ... ... and tell him that " herr zummer " is an awful choice .
he could do musical harm to the princess .
between us , no one in the world could do musical harm to the princess .
look ... ... i must have pupils .
without pupils , i can't manage .
you don't mean you're living in poverty?
no , but i'm broke .
well , how is this possible?
i hear your concerts are quite successful .
they're stupendously successful .
you can't get a seat .
but no one will hire me .
they want to hear me play ... ... but they won't let me teach their daughters , as if i was a fiend .
seriously ... ... is there any chance you could manage a loan?
only for six months .
eight , at the most .
you expect your fortunes to change in six or eight months?
as a matter of fact , i do .
i am working on something that will explode like a bomb all over europe .
i'll be the richest man in vienna .
i'll pay you back double .
anything .
you name the terms .
well , how exciting .
tell me more .
it's a bit of a secret .
come , come .
i'm interested .
this is delicious .
what is it?
it's cream cheese mixed with sugar ... ... suffused with rum .
crema mascarpone speciale .
italian .
forgive me .
we all have patriotic feelings of some kind .
two thou ...
two hundred florins .
that's all i need .
a hundred .
fifty .
what exactly are you working on?
really , i can't say .
i don't think you should become known in vienna as a debtor , mozart .
however ... ... i know a distinguished gentleman i can recommend , and ... ... he has a daughter .
quiet !
quiet !
herr mozart .
welcome .
pay no attention , they're impossible .
i treat them just like my own children .
which of them do you wish me to teach?
that's funny .
you're a funny fellow .
this is the instrument .
i hope it's to your satisfaction .
of course it'll be to his satisfaction .
come , we're going to listen to some music .
come !
good boy .
now .
please play me something , just to give me an idea .
anything will do .
just go ahead .
just as if we weren't here .
part of music , getting used to an audience .
right , " herr mozart "?
perhaps it would be better if we were left alone .
we're both a little shy .
play .
i said play !
michael , please .
perhaps if i play first , it might encourage the " frulein " .
why don't you let me try?
stop it !
stop !
he always howls when he hears music .
we've got to break him of that habit .
we've got to break them of their habit !
play .
please .
herr mozart " , play .
please , i beg you .
that's it .
that's it .
keep playing !
keep playing !
that's it !
mozart , that's wonderful !
wonderful !
next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs , let me know .
goodbye , " frulein " .
goodbye , madam .
goodbye , sir .
papa?
papa !
why are you here?
am i not welcome?
of course , welcome .
papa , welcome !
welcome !
you're very thin .
doesn't your wife feed you?
of course she feeds me .
she stuffs me like a goose all day !
is she not here?
no , she had to help her mother .
she's like that .
her mother's a very sweet woman , you'll ...
i didn't know you were home .
stanzi , this is my father .
we'll wait .
we'll wait .
why don't you get up now , my darling?
she's very tired , poor creature .
you know me .
i'm such a pig .
it's not easy cleaning up after me .
don't you have a maid?
oh .
no .
we could if we wanted ... ... but stanzi insists on doing everything herself .
how is your ... ... financial situation?
couldn't be better .
that's not what i hear .
what do you mean?
it's wonderful .
really , it's marvelous !
people love me here .
they say you have debts .
who?
who says that?
that's a malicious lie !
do you have pupils?
i don't want pupils !
they get in the way .
i have to have time for composition .
composition doesn't pay .
you know that .
that one will .
what's that?
it's a secret .
secret?
you don't have secrets from me .
no !
please !
i don't want you to see it .
i don't want anyone to see it .
you'll be so proud of me .
it'll be the best thing i've ever done .
the best thing anyone ...
there she is !
look at her !
isn't she beautiful?
now , papa , confess it .
could you want a prettier daughter?
stop it , wolfie !
i look dreadful .
are you ... ... expecting?
yes , i am .
isn't it marvelous?
we're delighted .
may i offer you some tea?
who wants tea?
let's go out !
this calls for a feast .
you don't want tea , do you?
i know !
let's go dancing .
papa loves parties , don't you?
how can you be so boring?
tea !
come on , papa .
hurry !
here we go .
good day .
now !
i name the penalty !
i name the penalty !
and the penalty is ...
give her a good one !
show us your legs !
come on , come on !
it's just a game , papa .
thank you .
herr mozart " , why don't you name your son's penalty? !
yes , papa .
name it .
name it .
i'll do anything you say .
anything .
i want you to come back to salzburg with me .
the penalty must be performed in the room .
i'm tired of this game .
but my penalty !
i've got to have a penalty !
i name a penalty !
the penalty is ... ... you shall play our tune ... ... in the manner of johann sebastian bach !
turn him over !
over? !
now you play it backwards !
another one !
give me another one !
play it like gluck !
boring .
another !
handel !
i don't like him !
another one !
play salieri .
now that is a challenge !
that is a challenge .
please !
please !
go on .
mock me .
laugh !
that was not mozart laughing , father .
that was god .
that was god laughing at me through that obscene giggle .
go on , " signore " .
laugh .
show my mediocrity for all to see .
one day i will laugh at you .
before i leave this earth ... ... i will laugh at you .
wolfie?
what?
there's a young girl here to see you .
what does she want?
she won't talk to me .
she says she has to speak to you .
damn .
yes?
are you " herr mozart "?
that's right .
my name is lorl , sir .
i'm a maidservant .
i was asked to come here and offer my services to you .
they'll be paid for by an admirer of yours who wishes to remain ... ... anonymous .
is this your idea , papa?
mine?
are you playing a trick on me?
i've never seen this girl .
is this some kind of joke?
not at all , sir .
young woman , this won't do .
my son can't accept such an offer , no matter how generous ... ... unless he knows who's behind it .
i can't tell you that , sir .
this is ridiculous !
what is ridiculous?
wolfie has many admirers in vienna .
people send us gifts all the time .
you cannot accept her without references .
well , this is none of your business .
whoever sent you is going to pay?
that's right .
splendid !
now we're going to let a stranger into our house .
who is we?
who is letting who ...?
could you please wait outside?
yes , ma'am .
look , old man !
we spend a fortune on you , and all you can do is criticize .
and now ...
stanzi !
no !
it's right that he should hear !
i'm sick to death of it .
we can't do anything right for you , can we?
you won't have to do anything for me ever again .
i'm leaving .
no , papa .
i won't stay and be a burden .
no one calls you that .
she does .
she says i sleep all day .
and so you do !
the only time you come out is to eat .
well , what do you expect?
do you expect anyone to walk out into a mess like this every day?
so now i'm a bad housekeeper !
so you are .
it's a pigsty .
when can you start?
right away , ma'am .
good .
they're out every night , sir .
thank you , sir .
do any pupils come to the house?
not that i've seen .
then how does he pay for all this?
does he work at all?
yes , sir .
all day long .
he never leaves the house till evening .
he just sits there , writing and writing .
really?
what is it he's writing?
i wouldn't know that , sir .
of course not .
you're a good girl .
you're very kind to do this .
the next time you're sure they'll be out of the house , let me know .
thank you , sir .
i think i found out about the money , sir .
yes?
what?
he kept seven snuffboxes in here .
i could swear they were all gold .
and now look .
there's only one left .
where does he work?
in there , sir .
gentlemen , i've just heard some news ... ... that may interest you .
what?
mozart is writing a new opera .
an italian opera .
italian?
that's not all .
he has chosen for his subject , figaro .
the marriage of figaro .
he's setting that play to music?
yes .
what is this " marriage of figaro "?
it's a french play , kapellmeister .
it has been banned by the emperor .
you're absolutely sure?
herr mozart .
gentlemen , sit down .
mozart .
are you aware that i have declared the french play " figaro " ... ... unsuitable for our theater?
yes , sire .
yet we hear you're making an opera from it .
is this true?
who told you this , majesty?
it is not your place to ask questions .
is it true?
yes , i ...
i admit it is .
would you tell me why?
majesty , it is only a comedy .
what you think is scarcely the point .
it's what his majesty thinks that counts .
but , your majesty ...
mozart ... ... i am a tolerant man .
i do not censor things lightly .
when i do , i have good reason .
figaro " is a bad play .
it stirs up hatred between classes .
in france , it has caused only bitterness .
my sister antoinette is beginning to be frightened of her own people .
i swear , there's nothing like that in the piece .
i've taken out everything that could give offense .
i hate politics .
i'm afraid you're rather innocent .
in these dangerous times i cannot afford to provoke our people ... ... simply over a theater piece .
majesty , this is just a frolic .
a piece about love .
love " .
again !
and it's new !
it's entirely new .
the people will go mad for it .
i have scenes ...
the end of act il , for example .
it starts as a duet .
a husband and wife quarreling .
suddenly , the scheming maid comes in .
it's a very funny situation .
duet turns into trio .
then the husband's valet comes in .
trio turns into quartet .
then a gardener .
quartet becomes quintet .
and so on , on and on .
sextet , septet , octet .
how long do you think i can sustain that?
i have no idea .
guess .
guess , your majesty .
imagine the longest time it could be sustained , then double it .
well ...
six ... ... seven minutes?
eight minutes?
twenty , sire .
twenty minutes !
twenty minutes of continuous music .
no recitatives !
sire , only opera can do this .
in a play , if more than one person speaks at once ... ... it's just noise .
but with opera , with music ... ... you can have 20 individuals all talking at the same time .
it's not noise .
it's a perfect harmony !
mozart , music is not the issue here .
no one doubts your talent .
it's your literary judgment that's in question .
even with the politics taken out , it would still remain a vulgar farce .
why waste your spirit on such rubbish?
surely you can choose more elevated themes .
elevated !
what does that mean , elevated?
i am fed to the teeth with these ... ... elevated things .
old dead legends .
why must we go on forever writing of gods and legends?
because they do .
they go on forever .
at least what they represent : the eternal in us .
opera is here to ennoble us , mozart .
you and me , just the same as his majesty .
bello , bello , bello .
come on now , be honest !
you'd rather listen to your hairdresser than hercules , horatius or orpheus .
people so lofty , they sound as if they shit marble !
what !
govern your tongue , mozart !
how dare you !
forgive me , majesty .
i'm a vulgar man ... ... but i assure you , my music is not .
you are passionate , mozart ... ... but you do not persuade .
sire , the whole opera is finished .
do you know how much work went into it?
his majesty has been more than patient , " signore " .
how can i persuade if i can't show it?
that will do , " herr mozart " .
just let me tell you how it begins .
may i just do that , majesty?
show you how it begins?
just that?
please .
look ...
there's a servant on his knees .
do you know why?
not from oppression .
he's measuring a space .
do you know what for?
his bed .
his wedding bed .
to see if it will fit !
late .
late !
on the beat .
good !
yes !
early !
well , mozart is already rehearsing .
in that case , gentlemen , i think ...
i think we should help mozart all we can .
and protect him against the emperor's anger .
what anger?
about the ballet .
what ballet?
excuse me ... ... but didn't his majesty specifically forbid the ballet in his opera?
herr mozart !
yes?
a word with you .
certainly , " herr direktor " .
now , " herr mozart " !
five minutes , please .
five minutes !
yes?
do you not know that his majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in operas?
it's not a ballet , it's a dance .
exactly .
a dance .
surely , his majesty didn't mean no dancing when it's in the story .
it's dangerous to interpret his edicts .
give me your score , please .
thank you .
what are you doing , " herr direktor "?
taking out what you should never have put in .
please .
please !
i have no one else to turn to .
what is it?
it's unbelievable .
the " direktor " has torn up a huge section of my music .
they say i have to rewrite the opera .
but it's perfect as it is .
i can't ... ... rewrite what's perfect .
please .
can't you talk to him?
please .
why bother?
he's no friend of yours .
i could kill him !
i mean , really !
kill him !
i threw the entire score into the fire , he made me so angry .
you burned the score?
no , my wife took it out in time .
thank god .
it's unfair that a man like that should have power over our work !
but there are those who have power over him .
i think i'll take this up with the emperor .
excellency ... ... would you?
with all my heart , mozart .
thank you .
please , " herr mozart " .
please , it's not a holy relic .
i don't need to tell you i said nothing , whatever , to the emperor .
i went to the theater to tell mozart something , anything ... ... when suddenly , in the middle of the third act ... ... to my astonishment , the emperor ... ... who never attended rehearsals , suddenly appeared .
what is this?
i don't understand .
is it modern?
majesty ... ... the " herr direktor " ... ... he has removed " un balletto " ... ... that would have occurred at this place .
why?
it is your regulation , sire .
no ballet in your opera .
salieri .
do you like this?
it's not a question of liking , majesty .
your own law decrees it , i'm afraid .
well , look at them !
no !
this is nonsense !
let me see the scene with the music .
but , sire !
oblige me !
yes , majesty .
can we see the scene with the music , please?
certainly !
certainly , " herr direktor " !
bring the palace set back in , please .
the restored third act ... ... was bold , brilliant .
the fourth ... ... was astounding .
i saw a woman ... ... disguised in her maid's clothes hear her husband speak the first ... ... tender words he has offered her in years .
simply because he thinks she is someone else .
i heard the music of true forgiveness filling the theater ... ... conferring on all who sat there , perfect absolution .
god was singing through this little man ... ... to all the world .
unstoppable .
making my defeat more bitter with every passing bar .
and then , do you know what happened?
a miracle !
with that yawn ... ...
i saw my defeat turn into a victory .
mozart was lucky the emperor yawned only once .
three yawns ... ... and the opera would fail the same night .
two yawns , within a week at most .
with one yawn , the composer could still get ...
nine performances !
nine !
that's all it's had !
withdrawn !
i know , i know .
it's outrageous .
still , if the public doesn't like one's work ... ... one has to accept the fact gracefully .
but what is it that they don't like?
i can speak for the emperor .
you make too many demands on the royal ear .
the poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour .
you gave him four .
what did you think of it yourself?
did you like it at all?
i thought it was marvelous .
of course .
it's the best opera yet written .
i know it !
why didn't they come?
i think you overestimate our dear viennese , friend .
you didn't give them a bang at the end of songs ... ... to let them know when to clap .
i know , i know .
maybe you should give me some lessons in that .
i wouldn't presume .
nevertheless , at the risk of imposing ... ... i'd like you to see my new piece .
it would be an honor for me .
no , the honor would be all mine .
i believe ...
i believe ... ... it is the best opera yet written , my friends .
salieri !
you are the brightest star in the musical firmament .
you do honor to vienna and to me .
herr mozart " !
it was good of you to come .
how could i not?
bravo , maestro .
did my work please you?
i never knew that music like that was possible .
you flatter me .
no .
salieri !
everybody's here and we've got guests .
bravo !
well , i've got some more .
you remember my good friend schikaneder .
come in .
don't be shy .
this is a very nice girl , and this ...
wolfie?
yes , my love?
these gentlemen are from salzburg .
salzburg?
we were just talking about salzburg .
your father is dead .
so rose the dreadful ghost ... ... from his next and blackest opera .
there on the stage , stood the figure of a dead commander .
i knew ... ... only i understood ... ... that the horrifying apparition was leopold ... ... raised from the dead !
wolfgang had actually summoned up his own father ... ... to accuse his son before all the world !
it was ... ... terrifying and wonderful to watch .
and now ...
... the madness began in me .
the madness of a man splitting in half .
through my influence , i saw to it ... ...
don giovanni " was played only five times in vienna .
but , in secret , i went to every one of those five .
worshiping sound i alone seemed to hear .
and as i stood there , understanding how ... ... that bitter old man was still possessing his poor son ... ... even from beyond the grave ... ...
i began to see a way ... ... a terrible way ... ... i could finally triumph ... ... over god .
herr mozart "?
i have come to commission work from you .
what work?
a mass for the dead .
what dead?
who is dead?
a man who deserved a requiem mass and never got one .
who are you?
i am only a messenger .
do you accept?
you will be well paid .
do you accept?
work fast .
and be sure tell no one what you do .
you will see me again soon .
wolfie?
my plan was so simple ... ... that it terrified me .
first , i must get the death mass , and then ... ... i must achieve his death .
what?
his funeral !
imagine it !
the cathedral , all vienna sitting there .
his coffin .
mozart's little coffin in the middle .
and then ... ... in that silence ... ... music .
a divine music ... ... bursts out over them all .
a great mass of death .
requiem mass for wolfgang mozart .
composed by his devoted friend ... ... antonio salieri .
what sublimity !
what depth !
what passion in the music !
salieri has been touched by god at last ... ... and god forced to listen !
powerless to stop it !
i , for once , in the end , laughing at him !
the only thing that worried me was the actual killing .
how does one do that?
how does one kill a man?
it's one thing ... ... to dream about it .
very different when you ...
when you have to do it ... ... with your own hands .
come in !
i've come to dinner
dinner !
are you mad?
i'm a nobleman !
i only ever dine with people of my own height !
stop it !
be careful be careful
hold tight
i'm a famous ... ... horseman
and we're a famous horsy
give me a hoof , my darling
and i'll give you my heart
take me to your stable
and never more we'll part
kill me kill me
we're going to make a soprano stew
we're going to make a soprano stew
and when you make a soprano stew
shut up !
i'm sick to death of that tune !
give me some hay , my darling
and i'll give you my heart
leporello !
some hay !
we hope ... ... you're contented
with what ... ... we've presented
and love our dove of peace
what did you think?
it was wonderful !
he liked the little people .
it's all in good fun .
i liked the horse .
i tell you , if you played " don giovanni " here ... ... you would've had a wonderful success .
you belong here .
not at the snobby court .
you could do anything you like .
the more fantastic , the better .
that's what people want : fantasy .
you write a proper part for me ... ... a couple of catchy songs ... ... i guarantee you a triumph deluxe !
what do you say?
how much will you pay him?
well !
i see you brought your manager with you .
well , madame ... ... how about half the receipts?
half the receipts !
stanzi !
i'm talking about now .
how much will you pay him now?
down payment .
down payment?
who do you think i am , the emperor?
i have to go .
stay here , you'll enjoy this next one .
you won't do this .
why not?
half the house !
when?
we need money now !
he pays you now , or you don't do it .
i don't trust that man .
i don't like what he did with your opera .
it was common .
you liked it .
monkey , punky , flunky !
half the house .
you'll never see a penny .
i want it here in my hand .
i'll put it here in your hand .
shut up !
you won't put a thing in my hand until i see some money !
it's embarrassing .
can't you think of anyone who can do something for him?
i'm afraid mozart is a lost cause , baron .
he has succeeded in alienating practically the whole of vienna .
he never pays his debts .
i can't think of anyone to whom i'd dare recommend him .
herr mozart " .
what a surprise !
what can i do for you?
is my pupil still interested in learning the art of music?
your pupil is married and living in mannheim , young man .
really?
perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction .
what is it , mozart?
what's the matter with you?
well ... ... since it appears no one is eager to hire my services ... ... could you favor me with a little money instead?
what for?
if a man cannot earn , he must borrow .
that's hardly the way to go about it .
you are right , sir .
you are right .
but you see , i am endowed with talent , and you with money .
if i offer mine ... ... you should offer yours .
i'm sorry , no .
please .
my answer is no , mozart .
please .
please !
don't answer it .
why?
tell him ...
tell him i'm not here .
tell him ...
tell him i'm working on it .
come back later .
am i interrupting something?
no .
good .
where's our friend?
he's not here .
but he's working on it , he told me to tell you .
is that it?
is he happy with it?
what's this?
a requiem mass?
you think i'm in the funeral business?
leave that alone !
put it down !
it's nothing for you !
i'm sorry .
what have you got for me?
finished?
what?
the vaudeville , what do you think?
yes .
can i see it?
no .
why not?
because there's nothing to see .
look ... ... i asked you if we could start rehearsals next week and you said yes .
well , we can .
so let me see it .
where is it?
here .
it's all right here in my noodle .
the rest is just scribbling .
scribbling and bibbling .
bibbling and scribbling .
like a drink?
look , you little cunt !
do you know how many people i've hired?
leave him alone !
i'm paying them !
he's doing his best .
paying them to wait .
it's ridiculous !
you know what's ridiculous?
your libretto !
only an idiot would ask him to work on that !
twelve foot snakes , magic flutes?
what's so intelligent about a requiem?
money .
money .
you're mad .
she's mad .
oh , yes?
wolfie , write it down .
just write it down .
on paper .
it's no use to anybody in your head .
to hell with your death mass !
calm yourself .
what's the matter with you?
i won't work there anymore .
what happened?
you don't know what it's like .
herr mozart " frightens me .
he drinks all day ... ... then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse .
is he working?
oh , i am frightened , sir , really !
when he speaks , he makes no sense .
is he working?
i suppose so .
he sits there all the time , doing some silly opera .
opera?
don't ask me to go back again .
i'm frightened .
i'm very , very frightened !
are you sure it's an opera?
i don't have it yet .
are you neglecting my request?
no .
no , i ...
i promise you ... ... i'll give you a wonderful piece , the best i ever ...
this is my wife , stanzi .
i've been sick , but i'm all right now , aren't i?
yes , sir .
he's all right .
and he's working on it very hard .
give me two more weeks .
please .
the sooner you finish , the greater your reward .
work .
wolfie .
i think you really are going mad .
you slave for that idiot actor who won't give you a penny !
and here , this is not a ghost !
this is a real man , who puts down real money .
why on earth won't you finish it?
can you give me one reason i can understand?
it's killing me .
you're drunk , aren't you?
be honest , tell me .
you've been drinking .
it's not fair .
i worry about you all the time .
i do everything i can to help you .
and all you do is drink and talk nonsense , and frighten me .
go back to bed !
please .
let me ...
let me sit here .
let me stay here with you .
i did it .
and i was proud to do it .
leave ! " i said .
right away .
take the child with you !
go to the spa and get your health back . " i was shocked .
shocked to my foundation when i saw her .
i couldn't believe my eyes , poor little thing .
you monster !
no one exists but you , do they?
you and your music .
i warned her .
choose a man , not a baby " , i said .
you marry him , you won't have a pot to piss in . " you selfish thing !
selfish , that's what you are .
simply selfish !
do you hear me?
pick him up .
pick him up !
be careful .
come with me .
you , follow me .
is it over?
yes , it's over .
it's over .
go !
go , go .
go .
go !
go !
where is your wife?
where is your wife?
she's not well either .
she went to the spa .
you are so good to me .
truly .
thank you .
please !
no , i mean to come to my opera .
you .
you are the only colleague of mine who came .
mozart .
i would never miss anything you had written .
it's just a vaudeville .
no , no !
it's a sublime piece .
the grandest " operone " !
i tell you ... ... you are the greatest composer known to me .
do you mean it?
it's him !
who?
the man .
he's here .
tell him to go away .
tell him i'm still working on it .
don't let him in .
no , no .
wait !
ask him if he would give me some money now .
tell him if he would , it will help me to finish it .
salieri?
yes .
can we come in?
better not .
he's sleeping .
he's all right , though?
yes , he's just exhausted .
he became dizzy , that's all .
well , tell him we came by , won't you?
of course .
give him this .
that's his share .
that should cheer him up .
indeed !
and now , good night to you all .
it was ... ... perfection , truly .
thank you .
what happened?
he said to give you this .
and if you finish by tomorrow night ... ... he will pay you another hundred ducats .
another ...?
that's too soon .
tomorrow night ...
it's impossible .
did he say a hundred?
yes .
it's too soon .
can i ...?
could i help you?
would you?
actually , you could .
i want to go .
where?
i want to go back to vienna .
now?
yes .
why?
i feel wrong .
i feel wrong being here .
where did i stop?
the end of the " recordare " .
so now " confutatis " ...
how would you translate that?
consigned to flames of woe .
do you believe in it?
what?
a fire which never dies , burning you forever .
