sunday , september 5
a grade school boy took a trip to lzu with his family , and they stayed in a cabin .
he wanted to go out and play ... but there was a tv show he didn't want to miss .
so he recorded it on the vcr in their room .
but the channels down there are different from tokyo's .
no station there uses that channel , so nothing should've been recorded .
you will die in one week .
the kid stopped the tape , and then the phone rang .
you saw it .
and the kid died a week later !
what's wrong , tomoko?
who told you that story?
everybody's talking about it .
was it yoko?
no , not her .
what?
i saw a weird video the other day .
where?
with yoko and the others . is it true that you all went on a trip somewhere?
nothing happened !
but that night ...
lwata found this weird video , and we all watched it .
what was it like?
it's hard to say .
as soon as it ended , the phone rang .
but nobody was there .
scary .
everyone else had heard that story .
today will be one week .
come on !
you're just trying to scare me !
how did you know?
i can't believe it !
you're so easy to fool .
but did you really spend the night there with lwata?
so what happened?
i'm not telling !
confess ! it's a secret .
it was true , wasn't it?
masami !
masami !
hello?
hold on a sec .
hello?
it s you , mom !
a friend came over .
okay .
got it .
all right , all right .
extra innings .
they'll be late .
my parents shouldn't have scared me like that !
look who's talking .
i'm going to tell everyone tomorrow .
i m going to the bathroom .
don't go upstairs without me .
sure .
on the mound , takasu , the third player ....
everyone's talking about this deadly video ....
yes .
have you heard what's on it?
yes .
don't look at the camera .
sorry .
one more time .
have you heard what the video is like?
i heard that suddenly there's this scary woman ... who says , " you will die in one week .
they say she appears when you watch late night shows on tv .
and then the phone rings .
late night shows on tv?
what channel?
i heard it was on a local channel down in lzu .
lzu?
yeah .
and is there really anyone who died a week later?
no one that we know .
well ....
what?
a high school student i know told me ... a girl who watched it died in a car on a date with her boyfriend .
an accident?
no .
they were found dead in a parked car .
he watched the video , too . it was in the paper a few days ago .
do you know which high school she went to?
no .
my friend heard it from a friend of hers .
ms. asakawa .
yes?
here .
thanks .
about ten years ago ... a star killed herself , and people saw her ghost on tv .
yeah , but this time everyone mentions the lzu peninsula for some reason .
well , maybe that's where this one started .
where did the story start about the woman with torn lips?
i think it was gifu .
there was a big traffic accident there and that's how it started .
a big accident?
these stories get started when people die horrible deaths .
did something happen in lzu then?
i don't know .
well , i have to go .
good night .
good night .
young couple found dead in car
a 19 year old tokyo boy and a 1 7 year old yokohama girl ... were found dead in a car on the morning of sept .
6
take care of it , okay?
i thought you were leaving early today .
okazaki , will you do something for me?
sure .
can you find out which high school she went to?
no problem .
call me when you find it .
okay .
yoichi !
sorry i m late .
you changed already !
i got your clothes ready , too .
thanks .
we need to hurry .
did grandpa call?
no .
how come tomoko died?
probably some disease .
zip me up .
do young people die , too?
sometimes they get sick .
but don't talk about that at aunt yoshiki's , okay? it s too painful for her .
yeah .
tomoko used to play with you , didn't she?
dad .
how's sister?
she's lying down .
better leave her alone .
i'll go help .
yoichi , you come sit here .
excuse me .
reiko .
does anyone know how tomoko died?
no , i don't .
but the police did an autopsy !
but there was no evidence of a crime .
people don't just die like that .
and they never opened the coffin .
isn't that strange?
yoichi .
don't play in this room .
let's go downstairs .
okay .
go ahead .
okay .
hello?
it's okazaki .
i found the name of the high school .
seikei girls 'school in yokohama .
thank you .
in loving memory seikei girls 'school
yoko died , too .
yeah , and lwata , too ....
sorry to interrupt .
was the girl who died in the car a friend of yours , too?
lf there's anything you know ....
all of them died on the same day .
yoko and tomoko .
and lwata had a motorcycle accident .
they saw the video .
the video?
yoko told us they'd all seen this weird video .
when it was over , they got a phone call .
tomoko saw it , too?
where?
they all went and spent the night somewhere .
a girl was with tomoko when she died .
she went insane and was hospitalized .
she never goes anywhere where there's a tv .
the girl was tsuji yoko , 1 7 , a senior at seikei girls 'school .
the boy was nomi tadahiko , 19 , a junior college student .
the car doors were locked .
i've never seen a corpse look like that .
cause of death?
unknown .
their hearts simply stopped .
drugs?
nothing in the autopsy .
they went up there to make out , then they suddenly died .
it doesn't make any sense .
i heard that yoichi came to the funeral .
yes .
he used to go upstairs and play in tomoko's room .
he did .

this is where i found tomoko dead .

hurry up and take it !
it s over .
no phone call .
copy this for me .
i'll take a good look at it .
you can't be sure that you're going to die . it s a video .
someone made it .
i il check who stayed there , and if there were any pirate broadcasts .
wednesday , september 15
from the lzu bureau .
thanks !
what are you going to do with the cabin registry?
sorry , but i just need to check something by myself .
was it you?
did you do this?
sorry i m late .
what's wrong?
nothing .
so , do you have any new information?
no one i phoned brought a tape to the cabin .
and they all sounded normal , not like they'd make a tape like this .
how about pirate stations?
there's no record of an illegal broadcast anywhere in lzu .
here's the copy .
asakawa .
have you ever seen this woman?
no .
this shot is strange .
from that angle , the cameraman should be in the mirror .
what do you mean?
i don't know .
you could fix it with special effects , but ....
eruption .
which eruption?
you can't read it on a regular home tv .
come in .
this is takano .
one of my students .
asakawa .
my ex wife .
how do you do?
i m takano .
i m asakawa .
the publisher wants your essay .
why did they tell you that?
because they couldn't reach you .
ask for a week extension .
me?
ask them yourself !
okay , okay .
not clear enough .
sada .
is yoichi all right alone?
he's used to it .
whoever made this video left a clue subconsciously .
the person wants to be found out .
wait .
frolic in brine , goblins be thine . " it sounded like that .
what does it mean?
i il check tomorrow .
... who says , " you will die in one week .
they say she appears when you watch late night shows on tv .
and then the phone rings .
thursday , september 16
late night shows on tv?
what channel?
i heard it was on a local channel down in izu .
izu?
yeah .
hello?
i found it .
like i thought , it's a dialect .
it's about brine and goblins .
a dialect?
from where?
oshima island , where there's a volcano , mt .
miharayama .
hello , yoichi?
i il be late tonight .
yeah .
are you okay alone?
i m sorry .
this is it , but it happened a long time ago .
mt .
miharayama eruption alert to local residents
did local woman predict eruption?
what is it?
does the paper have a bureau in oshima?
i think there's a correspondent there .
get me the number .
tonight .
why?
you only have four days left .
i il handle it with your correspondent .
please stay with yoichi .
grandpa !
welcome !
friday , september 1 7
yoichi wants to go fishing with you .
really?
c'mon , let's go !
let's get ready and go fishing !
yeah !
right there .
now that way !
grandpa !
you've got one !
we missed it !
you're not very good at this !
okay , let's try it again .
let's fish over here this time .
all right .
you're home .
hello?
the correspondent in oshima did some research for us .
the woman who predicted the eruption is probably the one in the video .
her name was yamamura shizuko .
she threw herself into the volcano 40 years ago .
what do we do now?
i'll go down there .
i'll go to oshima tomorrow .
oshima?
but i only have three days left !
i know .
and i have four .
i'll call later .
what's wrong?
nothing .
just doing my work .
auntie .
yoichi?
yoichi !
did you bring this?
how dare you?
why?
tomoko ....
tomoko told me to watch it .
i was careless .
i sensed something when i visited your house .
but i thought it was the video . it was tomoko .
she's not tomoko anymore .
can yoichi see her , too?
it s all my fault , isn't it?
it should have ended with tomoko and her friends .
i don't know .
where did this story come from?
nobody starts these kind of stories .
whatever people feel anxious about becomes rumor and starts to spread .
anxious?
or people start them , hoping things will turn out like this .
mr. hayatsu?
hello .
sorry you had to come all the way out here .
this way .
saturday , september 18
the yamamuras in sashikiji used to run a big fishery .
but they sold most of their business .
shizuko's cousin is still alive .
his son and daughter in law run an inn .
i ve booked you there for tonight .
why did yamamura shizuko commit suicide?
i heard she went insane .
the papers had written awful things about her .
she became famous all over the island after her prediction of the eruption .
she had strange powers all her life .
she was what they call a seer .
after that , a professor showed up .
you've heard of him . lkuma heihachiro .
wasn't he fired?
he brought shizuko to tokyo and experimented on her .
he was trying to prove the existence of esp .
the papers praised him , then trashed him .
it was 40 years ago , and the media still does the same thing .
i ve heard this story .
lf i m not mistaken , didn't someone die in the experiment?
dr. lkuma disappeared after his university fired him .
i doubt he's still alive .
even if we found him , what could we do?
they say shizuko had a daughter .
hello?
hello .
welcome .
i il leave you here .
please come in .
how many rooms?
two , please .
yes , sir .
this way , please .
sir?
please .
wait !
please tell me about shizuko !
there's nothing to say .
what about her daughter?
she didn't have a daughter .
not eating?
no .
when i die , stay with me .
cut it out .
please !
please?
and try to find a way to save yoichi !
stop it !
the girl who was with tomoko lost her mind , huh?
i don't know what'll happen to me .
you'll be all right !
because i m not normal?
maybe all three of us should just die .
good idea !
we shouldn't have had a kid in the first place .
stop it !
we still have two days left .
excuse me .
come in .
did you want to know about shizuko?
this is all that's left .
is this dr. lkuma?
yes . it was before i came here .
good night .
thank you .
frolic in brine ... goblins be thine .
sunday , september 19
you'd better leave this town .
there's a storm coming tonight .
what was shizuko like?
she was a strange one .
she used to sit here all day long .
she'd just stare at the sea every single day .
all the fishermen hated her .
the sea is ominous for us .
every year some of us die in the sea .
but she just kept staring at it
frolic in brine , goblins be thine .
lf you play in the sea , the goblins come to get you .
shizuko was able to read people's minds , wasn't she?
she must have known about things which people hid deep inside their minds .
that must have been painful .
go home !
i have similar abilities .
you were the one who spread a rumor about shizuko's abilities , weren't you?
you also called dr. lkuma .
nonsense !
you thought you could make money off of shizuko .
you earned money from the newspapers , too .
that's enough !
tell me about her daughter !
what happened to her?
i don't know !
she should have been with shizuko !
esp public demonstration
you were there ...
when shizuko gave her demonstration .
correct .
correct .
correct .
correct .
correct .
this is a fraud !
this is just a magic show !
you can't fool me !
dr. lkuma , she's deceiving you , too !
hey !
what's wrong?
he's dead .
she's a monster !
sadako !
did you do that?
sadako?
sada
sadako killed him?
she could kill someone just by wishing?
she was a monster !
sadako !
hey !
yes !
after shizuko killed herself , dr. lkuma took sadako with him .
but nobody knows what happened to them since .
find them !
dr. lkuma may be dead , but sadako should be in her 40s .
i il explain later .
hurry !
i doubt sadako is alive , either .
she killed a man just by wishing his death .
her power was much stronger than her mother's .
then that video .... it s not from this world .
it s sadako's wrath .
she's put a curse on us .
all the ferries have been canceled because the typhoon's too close .
try a fishing boat .
we'll pay .
a fishing boat?
the typhoon might change course .
you'd better wait .
okay , then i il find one !
mr. takayama !
mr. takayama !
hello?
ms. asakawa?
i'm sorry , but there's no trace of either of them .
hello?
thank you .
yoichi !
lzu !
ryuji !
ryuji .
the phone didn't ring at my house .
the only place it rang was at that cabin !
dr. lkuma must've ....
but we're stuck here .
you can't take a boat out on a night like this !
let me handle this .
sadako's calling you , isn't she?
or maybe she's planning to drag us into the sea .
take us !
it s strange , isn't it?
i m not afraid at all .
sadako probably died there , before that cabin was built .
was sadako dr. lkuma's daughter?
he had a wife and family .
his affair with shizuko caused a scandal .
that was another reason for his dismissal .
let's find sadako's corpse .
will that lift the curse?
will that save yoichi?
there's nothing else we can do .
i have one day left .
i guess sadako doesn't hate you .
shizuko used to talk to the sea .
she mumbled things to it .
she looked like she was having fun .
i hid once and listened .
but it wasn't a human language .
monday , september 20
hello?
yoichi?
it s mom .
i m coming back tomorrow .
i'm bored here .
i want to go back to school !
don't say that !
you'll hurt grandpa's feelings !
he's laughing .
do you want to talk to him?
that's okay .
i m sorry .
i il hurry home .
what's wrong?
i still have something to do .
say hello to grandpa for me .
what time did you watch the video? it was 7 or 8 minutes after 7 : 00 p . m . , but it was before 7 : 10 for sure .
lf the story's true , that will be your deadline .
here .
a well , just as i thought !
a well?
her father?
dr. lkuma put this lid on .
sadako's under here .
i il go down .
sadako was still alive !
she tried to climb up .
lower the buckets !
pull it up !
pull it up !
pull it up !
it s 6 : 00 p . m . already !
i know !
hurry and take it up !
pull it up !
asakawa !
damn it !
are you trying to kill me?
hey !
asakawa !
let's switch .
you can't lift anymore .
no !
then who's going to lift the buckets up?
we don't even know if it'll save us !
then what about yoichi?
you have to pick him up tomorrow !
don't look down !
where are you?
come out !
please !
where are you?
it s you .
hey !
asakawa ! it s past 7 : 10 !
we're saved !
why did he kill his own daughter?
maybe she wasn't his daughter .
i wonder if her father was even human .
the marks are gone .
it s over .
i il take you home .
get some rest .
i ve got a deadline for my essay .
thank you .
idiot !
tuesday , september 21
why?
now i got it !
asakawa !
are you a resident?
i m takayama ryuji's wife !
the body's been taken away , ma'am .
what happened?
when i got there , he was lying on the floor .
did he say anything to you?
about a video?
his face ....
why , ryuji?
will yoichi die , too?
didn't we lift the curse?
why was i the only one saved?
sadako's curse was only lifted from me .
why not you , ryuji?
what did i do that you didn't?
what did i do that you didn't?
ryuji?
something i did that you didn't ... to lift the curse .
i copied it ... and showed it to you !
dad?
yeah , i m on my way .
i have a favor to ask you . it s for yoichi .
i heard that there's a way to lift the curse from the video .
you have to copy it and show it to someone else within a week .
then what happens to them?
they have to do the same thing within a week .
then it never ends?
that's right .
it goes on forever .
but if you don't want to die , you'd do it , wouldn't you?
