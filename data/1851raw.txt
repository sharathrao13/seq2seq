the past everything that went before , is a dry leaf fallen from a dead tree .
the tree's been cut down , the leaf crushed by feet and ground into earth .
so now there is only the memory of trees .
i am the disease that rots the bark of trees .
i am rust and gravity .
in my dreams we are all together again and my mom is happy .
but then the leaves all fall off the trees and my dad is gone .
i call out to him , but wherever he is he can't hear me .
mr clark , please .
this is ap english .
if you can't extend a modicum of respect to your classmates , you are free to go right on down the hall to auto shop .
sorry .
thank you .
miss denning , how do you feel about that piece of writing?
anyone else?
praise , criticism for miss denning's poem?
it's very nice .
good work .
anyone interested in vying for the discovery award for young poets , we will be discussing the details today after school in poets 'circle , room 302 .
and , just in case the $3, 000 scholarship doesn't entice you , the finals are held in florida over spring break .
journals in the box .
miss denning ...
you can go deeper .
you're not staying?
i have to take care of my sister .
do you want me to pick up an application for you?
they're not gonna pick me .
auster's judging the finals .
what did he say to you?
nothin '.
a man in mexico burst his own eardrums with a pencil and sewed his eyelids shut .
he says because the government is deaf and blind to people's pain .
lily , shut up .
look .
stop it !
you'd better stay in there you little brat !
where's lily?
megan ...
i didn't do anything .
lily?
open the door .
what's it gonna take?
huh?
get ready for bed .
it wasn't my fault .
i expect you to take care of her when i'm gone .
get a baby sitter .
i can't afford a baby sitter .
you do have a responsibility to this family .
you had her .
you take care of her .
what did you say?
get out of my sight .
it's gonna get infected .
you've gotta stop hurting yourself , lily .
mr blazek .
mr blazek .
channelling bukowski very good .
mr cappo .
i believe " blow job " is two words .
or maybe it's a hyphen .
miss denning .
mr sadler .
another adventure story .
crap !
want a ride?
no , it's ok .
come on .
so are you starting to look for colleges?
oh , i think i'm just gonna stay here and go to sinclair .
well , there are scholarships , you know .
i mean , in addition to the contest .
well , i just got a job , so i'm kind of busy .
have your parents ever read your work?
my mom has school after her work so she's kind of busy , and i don't really see my dad .
ever?
birthdays and christmas and ...
he and my mom don't really get along so it's kind of ... kind of easier that way .
easier for you?
we're the building up on the ... on the right .
i'd like you to enter the poetry contest .
i can give you my lunch hour a few days a week to help you prepare .
but i'm not a poet .
not yet .
you miss the bus?
you see me on it?
no .
draw your own conclusions .
where'd you get those?
did you take them from the storage space?
draw your own conclusions .
put 'em away before mom comes home .
who's this?
dad .
no , the baby .
i wasn't an angel .
it's not me .
you have his face .
same chubby cheeks , same eyes ...
you look just like him .
lily , get up .
lily , you'd better be ready to leave in two minutes .
why are you all dressed up?
do you have your lunch?
no .
i don't want it .
why are you wearing mom's shirt?
why are you such a pest?
that's his house .
auster's?
yep .
he won some big award for writing a long time ago .
you know that leather book he carries around?
it's his novel .
how would you know?
my parents used to be friends with him .
if he told you to enter the contest , you're in .
sorry .
oh , no , please , don't be .
please .
great poets touch the hidden nerve .
so , we need a map of your nerve centres .
if you're going to reveal them in your work you need to know where they are .
that's for later .
what was " the memory of trees " about?
you said " i am rust and gravity .
what does that mean?
that i felt bad .
was there a particular time when you felt bad , or you just felt bad in general?
i don't know .
all right .
what was the poem about?
my dad leaving .
so what happened when your dad left?
was it day or night?
night .
did he say goodbye to you when he left?
miss denning , i want you to write about that day .
in detail .
write about the weather , write about what you were wearing , what you were thinking .
be specific .
a whole world emerges from little details .
for example , when we buried my son i'd forgotten to put in my contact lenses and i stood over him right before they closed the coffin trying to fix him in my memory .
i could see the red from his sweater and his blue pants , and there was a scab on his forehead that hadn't healed from a bicycle accident and i could feel that scab when i kissed him , but when i looked at him it was ... well , it was out of focus .
so , when your dad left what were you doing?
i don't remember .
forget that i'm here .
ok?
i'm not here .
now , just close your eyes .
where are you standing?
by my window in my room .
did your dad leave in a van , or a taxi , or ...?
a car .
a car .
what colour was the car?
blue .
ok .
go on .
you're on a voyage across an uncharted sea .
you must believe that there is land beyond the horizon .
what land remains as a question mark , but that is the mystery the joy of discovery ...
he doesn't write that stuff to me .
maybe he'll ask you to the prom .
shut up .
meg , mom wants to talk to you .
hi .
she won't .
she's on a hunger strike .
well , i can't make her .
hello?
i thought your class was only till nine .
whatever .
meg?
ok .
you tell me .
i don't know .
why not?
what's funny?
nothing .
well , why did you laugh?
i don't know .
are you afraid i'm gonna tell you that your work stinks?
does it?
what do you think?
probably .
i don't know .
come back when you do .
it doesn't stink .
there's a line that i like .
which one?
lost leaves spin past the glass , but the trees don't go , they stay by my window .
what about the rest of it?
i could go deeper .
good for you .
so , meg , how are things going over at seymour and cedar?
fine .
did they say they were happy with her?
well , steve hasn't called .
well , i guess that's good .
you don't have school tomorrow do you , mom?
no , honey , my interview is tomorrow .
why?
well , i just have this thing , this writing contest , where we're gonna read our stuff .
what time?
after school .
i don't know if i'll be able to make it .
i don't know when i'll be done .
i didn't call to confirm .
it's all right .
i talked to him this afternoon .
oh .
well , did he say who else he was considering?
somebody in plastics .
a man or a woman?
diane , stop .
then you'll have to take the bus to mrs rand's tomorrow , ok?
maybe when i get this job we can all go out and celebrate , huh?
the four of us .
have you sent don a thank you note?
no .
well , please do that .
he didn't have to help you get that job .
i'd like to read your story .
it's not a story .
i thought you said ...
it's a poem .
well , i would like to read it .
georgia in the contest too?
yeah .
well , maybe her mom can drop you off at mrs rand's .
i don't wanna go there , mom .
her house stinks .
don't start .
don went to a lot of trouble to get me this interview , and if i get that job it'll be a lot more money for all of us , so don't be a pill .
wish me luck .
good luck .
good girl .
this is called " blue car " .
i rode my bike past our old house .
a rusty chair keeps your place on the lawn .
lily cuts holes in herself to hurt you but you just won't bleed .
now she won't eat .
since you left mom doesn't say your name .
but even gone , i remember your face
the way the sun stays bright when i shut my eyes ,
the way a torch whipping the dark leaves a long red scar .
some nights when i wake up i forget where we are .
from our apartment , i can't see the stars or the horizon , only the road .
i know it goes to wherever you are .
miss denning , do you have a second?
sure .
losing a contest doesn't mean you lack talent , any more than ... than winning one makes you ezra pound .
do you understand that?
all of your life you'll be judged .
some people will love you some will say you stink .
none of it matters .
the opinions of these judges your friends , your mother , me .
what matters is the condition of your soul .
that it remain intact .
and that you stay strong and you keep doing the work no matter what .
i will .
no matter what .
i will .
i have to go .
so , congratulations .
i won?
yes , you did .
so now we have to talk about how to get you to the finals .
florida?
are you gonna be there?
yeah , i'll be there .
ok?
ms pound , you can ... you can go .
i would actually be reporting directly to don , though frank would be my boss .
so when do you hear?
could be as soon as monday .
i know you've been picking up the slack lately .
how does a sperm get into the egg to fertilise it?
i have some books at home .
i've read those books .
if the sperm is in the man's penis and then the egg is in the woman's uretus , how do they come together?
did i give you permission to borrow my blouse?
so how does the egg enter the uretus?
do we have to have another talk with father allwart?
no , thank you .
then keep your hands off of things that don't belong to you .
how does the egg enter the uretus?
uterus !
do you hear me?
don't touch my things without asking .
so our lives are difficult and perhaps unpardonable ,
and the fey gauds of youth have as the old men told us they would , faded .
but still , it is morning again , this day .
in the flowering trees , the birds take up their indifferent , elegant cries .
look around .
perhaps it isn't too late to make a fool of yourself again .
perhaps it isn't too late to flap your arms and cry out ,
to give one more cracked rendition of your singular , aspirant song .
is this where they have it?
yep .
you can hold on to that , if you'd like .
no lunch?
no .
come on , here .
oh , no , thanks .
it's ok .
no , no .
i will be offended if you don't .
what kind of bread is this?
it's rosemary .
you've never had it before?
tell your mom if she has any questions she can call me .
do you think she'll be able to come with you?
i haven't asked her yet .
if your family can't afford to send you the school might consider ...
we can afford it .
blue car " .
do you think i could win?
the girl wants to win .
maybe i should write that here on the application , huh?
well , no , maybe i should change my poem .
write about america write about something nice .
no .
you write what you care about .
can you read me some of your novel?
what do you mean , my novel?
georgia told me .
i'm not gonna copy you or anything .
just for inspiration .
in one creative thought a thousand nights of love revive , filling it with sublimity and exaltation .
and those who come together in the night in a rocking delight , do an earnest work , and gather sweetnesses , gather depth and strength for the song of some coming poet who will arise to speak of ecstasies beyond telling .
and though they err and embrace blindly the future comes all the same .
it's beautiful .
sorry .
no ...
what's up?
can i have some money for lunch?
meg , this is my son rob .
this is meg .
hi .
thanks .
i never realised he was your son .
that's my son .
ready or not the future comes all the same .
where's mom?
she took me to the doctor .
what did he do?
the usual .
we met don afterwards .
did she get the job?
i don't look like anyone .
not even myself .
he said not to indulge her .
when she gets hungry enough , she'll eat .
he's a quack , mom .
she hasn't had anything but water in two weeks .
she's probably eating at school .
maybe we could take her to florida .
over spring break .
it's a really good place for sick people .
i cannot afford the bills i have , megan .
i can't take you on a vacation .
well , if you get the job , then ...
i'm not getting the job .
angels don't fall out of the sky .
they emerge from within .
there is an angel within each one of you and he is your personal bridge to heaven .
this is the body of christ .
this is the body of christ .
blessed are the pure at heart for they shall see god .
i'm an angel .
the lord knows you are , my child .
the body of christ .
the body of christ .
lily ...
lily?
oh , god ...
honey?
lily?
lily?
honey?
is the hurt new?
yes?
i'm gonna get the nurse to fix it .
what do you think?
mr auster?
it's meg denning .
i'm sorry to bother you .
well , i just wanted to talk .
my sister's not doing very well .
mr kastran?
i have a family emergency .
ls it ok if i go home early?
my dad's here .
are there any customers upstairs?
no .
go ahead .
thank you .
megan , she's gonna be ok .
i don't know .
no , she will .
she's in the hospital now , and they're gonna take very good care of her .
it's ok .
she's gonna be fine .
i wanna take her to florida .
everything's gonna be fine .
i'm not gonna listen to my mom any longer .
you gonna be ok?
yeah .
sorry if i got stuff all over your shirt .
it's not a problem .
why are you so nice to me?
i mean , i'm glad .
thanks for coming .
anytime .
where the hell have you been?
i forgot my backpack .
where were you?
work .
i called work .
they said that you left with your father .
how did you get home?
a friend .
i have been driving around for two hours looking for you .
i called your father .
he had absolutely no idea what i was talking about .
you wanna go to florida?
i can't even trust you two miles from home .
get in there .
you can go to school and to work and to the hospital .
that's it .
you will come straight home after work and if you don't , then you don't get to work .
do you understand me?
and when i find out who your little boyfriend is ,
i'm gonna tell his parents he's an inconsiderate little brat .
unfortunately , we do need your mother to co sign for any withdrawals .
but it's my account .
that's the way the account was set up .
i wish that you could stay with us .
i wish that you could stay with us .
do you guys drive?
no , we fly .
unless pat goes .
but he's on parole , thank god .
the four of us in one car for ten hours is basically hell .
you know , you probably could stay with us .
i don't think tampa's very far from siesta beach .
that way all you'd have to do is pay for the airline ticket .
i don't know these people .
they're really nice .
did they invite us , or is this just georgia?
georgia said that she was gonna ask her family .
if you need to work , then i could take lily and you can have a break .
i don't know , megan .
i just ...
hello?
could you close that door , honey?
yeah .
because i don't believe you .
well , what about my family?
here .
i got you some chocolate , too .
your favourite .
they can make you disappear in the night .
they break the doors and windows and then they amputate the wings .
can you see them?
what?
wings .
they won't grow because there's invisible food in the tubes .
lily , you don't need wings .
we're gonna fly to florida .
in a plane .
the ceiling's too low .
what did they say?
they're gonna move her .
where?
the psychiatric wing .
hey .
everything ok at home?
oh , yeah .
everything's fine .
um , i was just wondering if it would be possible to get my pay in cash this week .
that could probably be arranged .
thanks a lot .
you bet .
when did you purchase these?
couple of weeks ago .
they were , like , $40 each .
you bought them here?
yeah .
this isn't our stock .
perhaps if you can find your receipt?
i got 'em at the beermans in oakmeadow .
i'm afraid i can't help you .
oh , god , no ...
it's lily .
the window was open , and she fell .
oh , jesus , god , no !
we deliver her up to you , o lord to your arms and your mercy .
the 23rd psalm .
the lord is my shepherd ; i shall not want .
he makes me lie down in green pastures ; he leads me beside still waters .
he restores my soul .
he leads me in right paths for his name's sake ...
i don't belong here?
for god's sake , she's my daughter !
you wouldn't know it !
you don't come around ...
and whose fault is that , exactly?
am i the one trying to turn the kids against you?
i'm going to work .
yeah .
yeah , all right , fine .
that's how we'll handle it , then .
bye .
do you have any personal belongings here?
no .
good .
clear out .
your pay should just about cover the cost of the ties .
get out of my store .
i need my money .
you should've thought of that before you stole from me .
i didn't steal anything !
get out of here anyway .
i didn't steal anything !
asshole !
what are you doing?
where are they?
the things you stole .
i didn't steal anything .
i thought we were done with this .
get out of my room .
when you contribute to the rent of this place , then it'll be your room .
hey !
hey , that's my stuff !
go ahead , ground me .
you're never even home .
what are you gonna do , hire an armed guard?
i'm going to florida , or wherever else i wanna go .
it's none of your business .
then maybe you better find someplace else to live .
fine .
i'll go live with dad .
oh , good .
you do that .
you think he's so wonderful?
you go see how you like it over there .
at least he doesn't try to control everything i do .
your father doesn't give a shit about you .
how many times did he come around here last year?
what , three?
he doesn't come here because of you !
he can't even manage to pay the lousy $60 a week in child support he owes me !
i am up to here in debts trying to give you a life i can't afford !
i work 12 hours a day and go to school at night so that i can make life nice for you , and all that i ask is that you respect the few rules that i lay down .
and when i stick my neck out to get you a job , you don't embarrass me in front of my friends .
that's all you care about , isn't it?
what?
your stupid friends !
stupid don !
you're an ungrateful brat .
what do you think you're doing?
you can't just pack her away into a storage unit like you did with dad .
put that back in there .
she's not yours , you fucking bitch !
i'm sure your mother feels a tremendous grief .
and to lose a child is ...
well , my son lucas was only four .
you wanna tell me how you feel?
i don't know .
how do you think your sister would feel if she lost you?
sad .
yeah ...
i don't know ...
mad?
well , who would she be mad at?
my mom .
why would she be mad at your mom?
do you think your mom could've saved her?
maybe i ...
maybe i could have .
this is not your fault .
it's not your ...
oh , come here .
you are very beautiful .
and you are ... and you are very ...
listen , why don't you take some time take all the time you need , and , you know , you can stay here ...
ok .

this poem ... po em ... is for mr auster .
it's called " now that i've read your book " .
i've memorised the lines .
it was easy .
the dirty white pages a margin of fancy designs .
you draw outlines of inverted hearts .
but mine's real , not a valentine .
as for the details ...
as for the details fiction , fiction , lies , lies ,
i am the coming poet who will arise .
crippled phoenix i fly up from your bed of ashes .
when my dad left , i cut off my hands and sewed up my eyes .
but that didn't keep me from reaching for you .
thank you for the gold star and your leaving .

do you remember when we drove into the country that one time?
to the place where they sell penny candy?
and it was you , me , lily and mom .
and we were driving over the bumps on the road so fast it felt like we were flying .

this old car likes you , too .
