good morning , london .
it's another brilliant overcast day today .
you want any of this?
no , thanks .
i got what i need .
thanks for making me look good , guys .
again .
shit .
amy klein , nice of you to join the meeting .
20 minutes late .
so , what about the story , then?
i couldn't get a verification on it .
oh .
you're kidding?
we'll send someone up .
thanks again for your contribution , klein .
great job , amy .
thanks .
hey , klein .
nice reporting .
how about you show me what you learned?
you want me to show you what i learned?
right here?
right now?
maybe later .
maybe not .
hey , amy .
good morning .
it's half past four .
charles , amy's here .
bye .
i detect that unique and ubiquitous combination of nicotine and patchouli oil that can only signal the arrival of the delightful and world famous amy klein .
eat me , charles .
you know , it's exactly that lack of respect for authority that got you fired from the " new york post .
i wasrt fired .
i was reassigned .
of course .
lucky for you , i opened my doors when i heard that you'd become available .
and , by the way , i don't recall ever being thanked properly for this reassignment .
i seem to remember a similar reassignment for you , charles .
well , look on the bright side .
we're back in the trenches together , just like old times .
don't get sentimental on me .
if this is about me being late with my follow up story ,
i've got it all right here .
i was just about to ...
it's not about your story .
though i'm sure you're working your usual insightful magic on what will prove to be yet another eye opening expos .
i expect nothing but brilliance in 5, 000 words .
or less .
but this , my dear ... is better .
what , then?
we're being sued again?
somebody mailed us this thing about two weeks ago .
what is it?
porn or something?
something .
amy , with your encyclopedic knowledge of skankology , have you ever heard of deaders?
yeah , me .
i owe two months 'salary on my credit cards .
no , not " debtors .
deaders .
d e a d e r s .
no , charles , i've never heard of deaders .
watch the tape .
this is something you must see for yourself .
don't be frightened .
fear is where you go to learn .
that's anna .
she isn't ready yet .
i don't think she's learned the truth yet from him .
winter .
this is where katia will commit herself for you to see .
it won't be pretty .
i'm marla .
official dead activist .
hi , me .
there she is .
and i have to show you this .
don't be frightened .
she's here .
i don't like this part .
shh .
do you become one of us of your own free will?
yes .
good .
are you afraid?
yes .
good .
fear is the place we go to learn .
say it for me .
my skin isn't real .
my eyes aren't real .
my bones , my heart , my veins , and nerves , and flesh , and meat aren't real .
go on .
i'm not ... real .
i'm not real .
i'm not ...
holy shit , charles .
just keep watching .
i am not real .
i'm not real .
i'm not real .
i'm not real .
i'm not real .
i am not real .
i'm not real .
oh , my god .
did you call the police on this?
just watch .
this is sick .
tell me this is some kind of special effect .
i'm alive .
i'm okay .
i'm okay .
what the fuck?
exactly what i said .
maybe miracles don't just happen at lourdes .
who says they happen there?
might you , by some chance , be interested in pursuing this?
you have anything besides the tape?
just a return address on the envelope .
in bucharest .
romania?
very good .
it's where the eurotrash kids looking for a good time are heading these days .
amsterdam is so '90s .
i still have my finger on the pulse , even though i know you think i don't have one .
ticket , hotel , per diem .
you know me too well .
it's what keeps me up at night .
now's the part where i'm supposed to say , " be careful .
amy .
call me when you get settled .
go away .
go on .
get out of here .
have you lost something?
yeah .
i ...
i'm looking for my sister , marla .
you don't know your sister's last name?
of course i do .
look , marla's a friend of mine , and she's missing .
i just need five minutes in there , and then i'll know all i need to know .
hmm?
ohh .
does it always smell like that in there?
like what?
right .
hey .
five minutes .
ugh .
hello?
god .
aah !
oh , no .
aah !
oh , fuck !
shit .
shit .
shit .
aah !
what are you doing in here?
aah !
aah !
aah !
aah .
whoever you are .
you were meant to find me today .
we all have the same story .
it's what brought us here .
you wouldn't be here if you didn't belong here , too .
i thought if you saw it and started believing it , it might help .
help all of us .
i'm starting to feel pain .
my eyes hurt .
the light really , really hurts .
and i don't know how to get back .
i just don't want to be here anymore .
i want to end it .
but i can't .
he'll expose your own demons to you , and he'll ask you to join him .
but don't , because there is no turning back .
and above all , don't open the box .
he needs for you to open the box , but don't .
it's now up to you to stop this .
please .
go to the central subway station .
at the south end , wait for the last car .
tell joey i sent you .
he'll show you to them .
please .
please do it for us .
open it?
open what?
aah !
aah !
aah !
don't think for a moment you are not in danger .
aah !
aah !
hello .
help us , amy .
what?
i'm looking for joey .
he's in the back .
yeah !
ah .
now here comes a daring soul .
a person committed to a just cause .
another seeker of the truth , no doubt .
are you joey?
i've been called worse .
i have the pleasure of meeting ...
amy klein .
amy klein .
somebody named marla sent me here to talk to you .
mm?
i'm looking for a girl named katia .
and a man .
a man named winter .
the plot thickens .
don't tell me you're mixed up with those motherfuckers .
oh , jeez .
moral quandary time .
what should he do?
what should he do?
why don't you just tell me what you know about the deaders?
you first .
what do you think they do?
i think they bring the dead back to life .
who are they , joey?
some say he's like this fucked up guru .
some think he's not human , or they think he's not real .
but they all live together in this house .
those who believe , i mean .
where is it?
if you don't tell me , someone here will .
you know , that's the problem .
you've got this fucked up , self destructive thing going on .
and that is making me very unappy .
panduri and kovacs .
okay?
the northeast corner .
two doors down .
there are some stairs that go all the way down .
but once you get mixed up with them , chances are you never get loose .
amy klein !
don't do it .
don't go there .
change your name , go somewhere else , become something else .
can't do that .
i got that fucked up , self destructive thing going on .
yes , you do .
only he can bring you back .
aah !
no !
where?
where is he?
where'd he fall?
well , the men have looked .
and he wasrt there .
you don't seem terribly surprised .
what do you want me to tell you?
i saw him .
yeah .
so you've said .
can you tell me again just what it is that you saw?
i'm standing on the platform , and i see this ...
he had his back to the train .
that's him .
that's the guy .
it's him .
hey .
hey , it's him .
hey !
hey !
i saw what you did to marla .
stop !
get the fuck off me !
get off me !
i know who you are !
that's the guy .
get the fuck off me !
stop him !
what the fuck are you doing?
let go of me !
you won't get away with this !
hey !
you are lucky to have a boss like me .
once again , i have saved your small but relatively shapely behind .
at least you got to travel .
what were they gonna charge me with , anyway?
charge you?
they were thinking of shipping you to the asylum for observation .
believe me , you go in there , you don't come out .
got your stuff?
why did you give me this story , charles?
who else would have taken it?
they're gonna think it's bullshit , or they're gonna be too afraid .
but amy klein .
tell me it's real , amy .
it's real .
or i'm crazy .
either way , it's a good story .
you see , amy , for the average person , the hunger for knowledge is like the hunger for food .
we want to know just enough to take the edge off our appetite .
then we're satisfied , and we stop .
but you are a glutton .
you can't help overeating .
i don't hear you complaining .
no , that's the point .
that's why i still need you .
'cause all that stuff i don't eat , i still want .
so i send you in to do the eating for me so i get to experience it without actually suffering any mental indigestion .
thanks a lot .
so , i do all the suffering .
nobody's forcing anything down your throat , correct?
no .
i'm not here to save people , and i'm not here to judge them .
i take them as they come and use them as they pass by .
you know , there's something vaguely demonic about you .
did you know the word " demon " comes from the greek word for " knowledge "?
no , i didn't .
american education .
hop in .
i'll give you a lift .
no , thanks .
i need the fresh air .
then walk back to your room ,
lie in your coffin until the daylight hours have passed , as is your habit , then go get me my story .
panduri and kovacs .
damn it .
aw , shit .
hello?
is anybody there?
hello?
is somebody there?
what the hell?
whoa !
aah !
aah !
oh , god !
no !
no !
no !
no , no !
aah !
aah !
shh .
follow me .
one of us .
amy klein .
you know me .
i chose you .
you didn't choose me .
i came here to help marla and the others .
and what makes you think they need help?
tell me , amy klein , were you afraid when you saw marla?
of what you found?
yes .
what is it?
you might say it's a family heirloom passed down through many generations .
left here as a gift .
the way to cheat death .
an entrance to a world of everlasting pleasure .
it rightfully belongs to me .
though there are others who might disagree .
should i be honored or afraid that you are here with me , amy klein?
you tell me .
don't dance with me .
don't think for one second that you're not in danger .
you are in more danger than you ever imagined possible .
who are you?
i am here to reclaim what is mine .
and you are here to help me .
it is your destiny to be here .
i can give life back to those who choose the dark over light and will do so much more .
but first , i need your help .
what happened to marla?
what did you do to her?
marla?
why , i accepted her , that's all .
that's all i've ever done for anybody who's come to me .
she didn't want to become one of you .
whatever the hell you are .
that's why she killed herself .
or did she?
marla will never really die because she's not really alive .
the more she doubts ...
the deader she becomes .
i know what i saw in that room was real .
it was real , like this flesh .
do you think this is real?
this flesh?
this blood?
no .
do you think this thing is a presence?
in all essential qualities , it is less than nothing .
in all essential qualities , we are less than nothing .
not solid .
not here .
and not real .
what did you see?
what are you afraid of , amy?
i'm not afraid of you .
oh , yes , you are .
you opened the box .
now i need you to take the next step .
the box and all its powers belong to me .
get off of me !
let me go !
you're all crazy !
let go of me .
accept my gift .
no !
no !
keep still , amy .
now give back to me what is rightfully mine .
get away from me !
no !
no more pain .
no !
only pleasure !
yes !
get it together .
no .
no .
aah !
what the hell?
shit !
what the fuck is going on?
no !
holy shit !
no !
what the fuck is going on?
this is a dream .
this is a fucking dream .
this is a fucking dream !
no !
god , help me !
what have you done to me?
help !
aah !
no !
no !
no !
oh , it's not real .
this is not real .
aah !
aah !
aah !
only he can bring you back , amy .
what the fuck have you done to me?
not done .
nor will i.
who are you?
why did you do this to me?
who i am is no concern of yours .
and you may be assured that this is not my handiwork .
ask yourself this .
when you stand there , your flesh exposed , paddling in a pool of your own blood , why is it that you feel no pain?
because i'm dreaming .
because this is a fucking dream .
no !
not a dream .
you have been recruited as a soldier in another mars war .
a war that he can never win .
you opened the box , and your soul belongs to me .
as does his .
the deaders have discovered an entry into my world .
my domain .
but they can only complete their journey through you , amy klein .
and your only way back is through me now .
i am your redeemer .
i am the way .
no !
don't even start .
joey .
please , i need you to help me .
help you with what?
wow .
are those real?
joey , please !
i need you to fucking help me !
you gotta give in , amy .
you're trying too hard .
forget about the facts .
forget about reality .
just sit back .
enjoy the ride .
there's nothing you can do about it anyway .
we're all just pieces in winter's puzzle .
the box .
you're a person who's willing to do anything to find the truth .
that's what i find attractive about you .
that and the fact you got a great ass .
but me and you ain't all that different , really .
we'll do anything to go to the edge , to the extreme .
you know what our biggest problem is?
neither of us know when to get off the fucking train .
joey .
joey .
oh !
oh , god !
oh , god !
no !
aah !
aah !
no !
aah !
no !
aah !
aah !
aah !
aah !
marla?
what is happening to me?
you're dying .
like me .
come on , let's go .
where?
that's for you to decide .
marla , look at me .
i just want to go home .
amy .
you are home .
marla , wait .
where are we going?
home .
you said you wanted to go home .
marla .
what happened to you?
just think of it this way .
an hour ago , i stabbed you in the heart , yet you're still walking around .
isn't that a bit unusual?
yes .
why aren't you dead , amy?
no !
why aren't i?
i don't know .
because when it's dark enough , there's no such thing .
there's no difference between being dead and alive .
and now i'm here to help you face your past , amy .
your demons .
i didn't choose you to stab me in the back .
aah !
yes , you did .
but it was only a rehearsal , amy , to get you used to this feeling .
you need to decide what to do next .
winter wants you because you opened the box .
he needs you because of this .
but you'll help him only if you become a deader willingly .
and you can't have any doubts .
guess i screwed up on that part .
fear .
fear is where you go to learn .
and sometimes where you stay .
no !
i'm sorry , amy .
i told you there's no turning back .
no !
aah !
good morning .
amy , calm down .
calm down .
we're gonna get you out of here .
what?
look , i'm trying to get you out of here , back to london .
but with that mess you made in your hotel room , they're not gonna let you go so quickly .
charles .
that's the best fucking news i've heard in a long time .
well , there you go .
there's a whole new definition of optimism .
what about marla and the story?
forget about the story .
what's important is you're back here , okay?
but , hey , you know , this is a great story , too , you know?
you could call it " my psychotic episode .
or " psychotic .
episode one .
well , you look a lot better .
maybe they'll let you use some felt tip pens to take some notes .
how are we feeling?
trapped .
what say we lose the charm bracelets for now?
unless , of course , you find all this somehow stimulating .
don't drag me into your little fantasies , charles .
please .
i'm drawing pictures .
they're very lovely .
mind if i join you?
okay .
want me to draw your picture?
i would like that very much .
no peeking .
what do you think?
marla?
marla , you're alive .
you say that like it's a good thing .
marla , what's happening to me?
why am i here?
ultimate pleasure .
more than anyone , even those who have solved the puzzle box before us could have imagined .
conditions of the nerve endings , the likes of which your imagination could not hope to evoke .
at least that's what they say .
trouble is , winter can't solve the puzzle .
only a few chosen ones .
just the right amount of depravity and loneliness in their souls can .
so he's been on this quest for years .
searching for that one mythical person .
the one person willing to both join us and who can solve the puzzle .
it wasrt me .
maybe it's amy klein .
why me?
why any of us , amy?
we all have a dark past that we keep hidden , even to ourselves .
he uses that against us .
but you're the chosen one , amy .
you opened the box , and only you can stop him now .
remember that .
looks like you're running out of time .
no .
no .
no !
leave me alone !
ugh !
finish it , amy .
no .
let all the pain go .
it is time for you to finish your journey .
aah !
yes .
no !
come on , amy .
you got that fucked up , destructive thing going on .
i don't belong here .
i'm sorry .
you see , you're one of us now .
all you have to do is take the final step .
yes .
that's it .
i don't think so .
go to hell .
no !
it seems that evil does run in the family .
your lineage is that of a craftsman .
a maker of toys .
you should have stayed in the family business .
i sacrificed my mortal self to that box .
it's mine now .
it belongs to me .
well , that's where you're wrong .
painfully wrong .
we belong to it .
you can't hurt me .
you're not the first to say that .
and you won't be the last .
help !
help me !
no more !
when you were tempted to live beyond death , you entered into my domain .
oh , god !
you should be very careful what you wish for .
aah !
stop !
aah !
it just might come true !
aah !
this world .
it obviously disappoints you all .
that is why you chose to begin this journey .
and since you gave yourselves so willingly , allow me to finish what he started .
oh , for fuck's sake .
so , amy klein .
you opened the box .
you brought us all together .
and now you must pay the price .
it won't be so easy this time .
yes , your father is with me .
and he is waiting for you .
you're here to stop this , amy .
don't let him take you .
your soul is mine and mine alone .
only he can bring you back .
there is no way back but through me !
i didn't give my soul to him .
i'm not gonna give it to you .
aah !
no !
witnesses say the building at the corner of panduri and kovacs simply imploded sometime in the early morning hours .
it is unknown at this time if there were people inside the building or if there was anyone hurt during the collapse of the structure .
there are reports that victims could be heard screaming .
just talked to the police .
still nothing .
she's just gone .
left her hotel .
left her clothes .
left her money .
no sign of her anywhere .
see no amy , hear no amy .
do you think something has happened?
i don't know .
i just don't know .
the firefighters have been on the scene throughout the night .
too bad .
we may have a story .
the worst of the fires seem to be put out .
i mean , until all this happened .
other sources say that it is highly unlikely that anyone or anything withstood the impact from the destruction of the building behind me .
this keeps getting better and better .
your 3 : 00 is here .
hmm?
miss ...
turner .
turner .
miss turner .
yes , pleasure to meet you .
welcome to the team .
now , look , i want to show you a tape that i just received .
now , it's a story you might be able to wrap your head around .
that's , of course , if you're willing .
a small relic found incredibly and mysteriously undamaged .
we'll stay here for the remainder of the day .
