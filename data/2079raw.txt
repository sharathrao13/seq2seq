in the year 1954 , half a century ago ... ... our country suffered a terrible attack by godzilla .
our capital was a battlefield .
only the courage of the men before us ... ... saved this country from total destruction .
that battle was the only real battle ... ... that our self defense forces have had to fight ... ... since their foundation in that same year , 1954 .
since then , our country has enjoyed a long period of prosperity .
however , the peril has not disappeared .
a few years ago ... ... another giant monster attacked eastern america at new york city .
since that attack ... ... there have been numerous sightings in various countries .
the new york attack was godzilla , right?
that's what all the american experts claim .
but our guys here have some doubts .
the database is constantly being updated with new information .
what's that?
dismissed !
division , attention !
hey , a u. s. nuclear sub's missing .
prepare for a news flash !
come on , let's get moving !
hurry up , hurry up .
an american nuclear submarine ... ... is missing off guam in international waters .
this morning , the navy sent a search and rescue unit ... ... to help locate the missing submarine and its crew members .
because of the potential nuclear risk ... ... the navy is dispatching its rescue submersible satsuma .
a navy cruiser with the satsuma onboard ... ... will be leaving the port of yokosuka later today .
both vessels will be helping the americans with their rescue efforts .
satsuma approaching search area .
there seems to have been an explosion .
i can't control it !
hey , what's going on?
what's happening down there?
what's that on the screen?
i don't believe it !
it can't be happening !
traditionally , mt .
myoko was thought to be ... ... the ancient gateway to the lost world .
we're here to solve a mystery as ancient as the mountain itself ... ... and that mystery concerns the monster of the mountain .
what was that , the monster?
all right !
cut !
hey , you !
stop it !
stop shooting !
you hear me?
stop shooting immediately !
do you hear?
what do you mean?
look .
we have a permit to film here .
you didn't say it was gonna be a work of fiction .
no , it was supposed to be a documentary !
look , it's a " docu drama , " if you like .
you call it what you like .
i looked up your bs digital q.
specialized in low budget drama series .
favorite themes are esp and alien life forms .
we don't want you people ruining the reputation of honest villagers .
now , get lost !
oh , please don't be like that , sir .
think of the kids .
they love stories of ghosts and monsters .
in the states , there are many stories about witches .
they've made some of the villages famous worldwide .
godzilla could do that too .
if godzilla did come into your village , think of it .
everyone in japan would want to come here .
and do you think he will come?
an earthquake !
don't worry !
what was that?
it's all right .
it's over .
i'm sorry .
wow , that was something !
so may we continue , please , sir?
sure , you go right ahead .
yes , i'm sure your film is going to attract thousands of tourists .
thanks !
great .
right , okay .
hey , the camera , you got it?
it's here .
our village will be famous the world over .
i was even interviewed on camera .
and who knows?
you may become a movie star .
let's go .
did you see what they did?
they wrecked it !
what the hell are you doing?
you're gonna kill yourselves .
an earthquake .
hold it !
there was an earthquake last night .
didn't you hear about it?
i just can't understand it , it wasn't recorded !
maybe it was just too far away .
but the epicenter moved !
what?
hey , what are you talking about?
that's not all .
i heard an eerie voice as well .
let me take a crew and check it out .
i got a hunch about this .
a hunch?
yeah .
our specialty is making cheap sci fi series ... ... not investigative reporting .
this could be a great chance to make something worthwhile .
if we want to survive ... ... we're gonna have to concentrate on quality .
look , our clients expect us to make low budget stuff ... ... not news documentaries .
we're right above the tunnel now , 10 miles south of mount myoko .
this is where 20 people were buried alive .
the road has been closed ... ... and rescue operations are continuing to find the bodies .
the entrance to the tunnel is blocked by tons of rock ... ... and access is , for now , impossible .
all right .
lift it slowly !
help them !
d3 unit locked on target !
fire !
and will it explode once inside?
what if the explosion's too strong?
don't worry .
it's under control .
you said there's a witness?
oh , sure , sure .
here .
it had a big head and a big mouth .
and you say the thing was alive?
yeah .
godzilla .
it's godzilla !
i sometimes wish i'd been born a man .
why's that?
i think you make a great girl .
because i'm not allowed to make the programs i want to make .
as a woman , you're expected to do as you're told .
that sucks , don't you think?
good evening !
hey !
so who's this?
so you got my message?
no one believes the moving epicenter story , i'm afraid .
however ...
the guardian monsters .
it may be a clue to what happened yesterday .
it makes interesting reading , believe me .
who's he?
goddamn mutt !
what's the matter?
i don't like dogs .
don't worry , i'll get rid of him .
why don't we get rid of the dog .
just dump it overboard !
hey , i think they fell overboard .
what the hell's going on?
what's the matter?
can't you ...?
help me !
hey , what is that?
i just brought yuri home , sir .
so i see .
i'm grateful to you .
it's okay .
father !
what a nice surprise .
daughter yuri reporting for duty .
i don't find this funny , okay?
i'm sorry for all the trouble .
no , really , here .
good night , sir .
see you tomorrow .
you're drunk again !
no , i'm not drunk .
i'll make some coffee and run you a bath .
how do you feel?
fine , thanks .
what's up?
something bothering you at work?
no , not at all .
the job's fine , the people are great .
it's just a pity the programs you make are such garbage .
then don't watch them .
who was the guy last night?
oh , that's takeda .
is he your boyfriend?
no , he isn't my boyfriend , thanks .
he helps me with my research .
well , i guess in that case , i should have been nicer to him .
you were fine , dad .
i'm the one who was out of order last night .
i'm sorry .
no , i'm sorry .
eleven people met their deaths yesterday at lake ikeda ... ... when their boat suddenly overturned .
their bodies were found this morning wrapped in a cocoon .
the young men and women were on a cycling trip from tokyo ... ... and were camped at lake ikeda ...
it's lake ikeda .
southern kyushu , that's strange .
that's where takamori saigo was exiled over 100 years ago .
i wonder ...
is it coincidence?
so some prediction says hundreds of people will die .
somewhere near mount fuji , right?
you think we should publish it?
but it isn't just a prediction .
mount myoko , lake ikeda , all the places are in the book .
about last night , you still mad?
look , i'm very sorry .
normally , i don't drink .
look , there's no need to apologize .
why should i be mad at you?
he's just embarrassed for leaving you behind .
yeah , it was my responsibility to see you home .
just count yourself lucky you didn't .
i got the third degree .
it wasn't so bad !
your dad sounded like a tough guy to me .
he's tough , but he's okay .
tell me , lieutenant , did you actually see it?
yes .
and can you describe what you saw?
yes , it was like the fin of a huge creature .
it's believed godzilla fed off the energy radiated by the submarine .
yeah , but who can prove that it was godzilla?
even if it was godzilla , it hasn't been seen for 50 years .
why would it choose to come back here?
it doesn't make any sense .
why should it choose japan again?
nobody can answer that question ... ... but we have to be ready for the worst scenario .
couldn't he have picked on some other country?
whenever we increase our defense spending ... ... we're accused of depleting the government's resources .
even if it does come back again ... ... our forces are now equipped with weapons that are far more advanced ... ... than anything we had before .
oh , yeah , sure .
he's a well known character around these parts .
godzilla will return one day !
as if anyone gives a damn .
please .
it's him .
you know him?
i saw him at mount myoko .
mount myoko in niigata prefecture?
must be a mistake .
he was caught destroying some old shrine , so we had to lock him up .
oh , by the way , have you visited our website yet?
yes , it's very interesting .
well , you see , i'm the webmaster .
godzilla will return .
we don't have much time left .
go to the sacred place where the great ghidorah lies sleeping .
ghidorah?
you must wake the thousand year old dragon ... ... before it's too late .
and maybe together they can stop him .
baragon , mothra and ghidorah .
ghidorah was known as the eight headed dragon .
the men responsible for killing them called them the sacred monsters .
the people began to worship the beasts 'souls ... ... that were supposed to sleep for 10, 000 years .
despite having killed the monsters ... ... the ancient people still prayed for their souls .
do you think that ghidorah is alive?
only 2000 years have gone by .
it's much too early for that .
ghidorah still has some more growing to do .
once he is grown , he'll be strong .
yuri , what do you have there?
i'm sure that old man must have put it here .
what makes you say it was him?
just a hunch , it's a feeling .
yeah !
when he made the gesture in the cell .
that's right , i'm sure he meant this stone .
but i don't understand it .
hey , look , it's gone !
what?
you see here?
it's disappeared !
the storm has worsened to a typhoon and is heading slowly northwards .
winds have reached force 10 to 11 in the bonin islands .
conditions are not likely to improve ... ... until tomorrow evening or thursday morning .
you won again !
this damn weather , it's a real drag .
hey , where's that?
oh , the old lady here told me about those .
they're pictures of the village where godzilla came ashore .
it must have been over 50 years ago .
yeah , but i thought that the army killed godzilla , right?
sure , but it wasn't that poor creature's fault , right?
how on earth could they do such a thing?
godzilla would be great as a pet !
hey , that's not an earthquake !
artillery shells can do nothing to stop it .
this animal has survived for eons .
atomic weapons and energy ... ... have given it extraordinary capacities for survival .
but it's still an animal , and it can be defeated .
but i repeat , not with any weapons .
this animal represents the collective will to survive ... ... of many thousands of people .
collective will?
this animal contains the restless souls of the countless people ... ... who perished during the terrible battles ... ... that took place during the pacific conflict .
their souls?
in godzilla?
say , yuri , do you really believe the old fart , huh?
he's not making it up , i know that .
the souls of all those people ...
everything he's told us was written in his book .
you know , one of my wife's relatives says she was trampled by godzilla .
really?
that's interesting .
they think i'm mad .
if you ask me , godzilla is old hat ...
never mind .
but tell me ...
just carry on with your project . ... why is godzilla attacking japan?
why does it want to destroy us?
because the japanese people want to forget what happened .
what?
they have deemed it preferable to forget the pain and agony ... ... they inflicted on all those people !
we're above magonot village now .
the place has been completely leveled .
it seems to have been due to a landslide .
can you see any survivors?
we'll make another low pass and check .
hey !
that hill wasn't there before !
what?
that hill !
albatross !
what's happening?
my god !
it's moving !
mayday !
albatross !
come in , please !
albatross !
hey !
come in !
the earth remembers , the stones remember .
if the earth and stones could only speak ... ... they would tell us many things .
it's from a proverb from american indians .
stones can record history like a cd .
pressurized granite records geological information .
so rocks can yield up history , just like a cd can .
you follow me?
if spirits are another form of electricity ... ... maybe there's a way for them to be stored in stone .
could he have done that?
and then he could have released all the souls ... ... and managed to find a way to channel the souls ... ... and somehow put them into the guardian monsters to wake them .
but why would he want to do it?
to protect japan against godzilla !
monster !
from information contained in these reports by the defense agency ... ... we have now come to the conclusion that the monster ... ... that attacked the american submarine and a japanese island ... ... is likely to have been godzilla .
so the government has issued a security bulletin ... ... for all areas around the coast of japan .
godzilla !
godzilla's coming !
he's going to kill us all !
godzilla !
come on , father !
the least you could do is tell me !
what could i tell you?
oh , come on !
i mean about godzilla , of course !
i'm a reporter !
then you should have other sources .
don't rely on me .
look , i should tell you ... ... i have some important information for you .
starboard 15 .
half ahead .
clear forward deck !
report from the ako , southeast area clear .
it's been three days already .
still no sign of godzilla , sir .
to be honest , some of the men don't think godzilla exists .
so you see , baragon , mothra and ghidorah ... ... are there to protect us , the guardian monsters .
i don't understand .
why attack us , then?
well , what they're defending is our homeland .
yes , that's the difference , our homeland .
nothing to do with the nation .
the homeland means the mountains and rivers and forests and things .
and you really believe that rubbish?
all i can say , father , is his story's believable .
do you have a better story?
but one thing i don't understand ... ... is our soldiers died for their country .
so why do they now want to destroy japan?
but so many other people suffered all over asia .
their spirits are overwhelmingly more numerous .
don't you see?
i've just returned from the bonins .
glad to see you , captain .
my daughter .
the island is a disaster zone .
i'm afraid the government has decided to cancel operations .
what?
they've canceled everything?
we're to maintain our surveillance .
however , the minister doubts its existence .
these years of peace ... ... seem to have dimmed the memories of what happened .
but i haven't forgotten those events , captain .
oh , no .
i remember perfectly .
fifty years ago , the sky was red ... ... buildings and railroads destroyed by godzilla .
a nightmare .
its huge and menacing figure slowly advancing .
i could see its head .
the head of a devil enraged with hate .
i ran .
i ran for my life ... ... trying to find a refuge , and when the terror ended ... ... my parents were gone .
gone forever .
i , for one , shall never forget those events .
the terrible screams of the people being trampled .
yes , send a report , urgently .
right , the epicenter .
readings show it's moving underground !
nagano reports the epicenter moved underground .
epicenter still moving in a southward direction .
do you think we should issue another warning?
it won't make any difference , they're not even ready to move yet .
better tell the commander .
i recorded it , my father's story .
good idea .
i found it very moving , to be honest .
welcome !
i don't think we should use it , do you?
i recorded it for my own use .
i'm also his daughter , remember?
then you should be able to convince him ... ... about the guardian monsters , shouldn't you?
yeah , well , dad's also a navy commander .
it now appears that the earthquake in nagano prefecture is not over .
the epicenter seems to be moving ...
the epicenter's moving !
i heard .
it was felt first in niigata and later on this afternoon in shizuoka .
the guardian monsters !
lf it's niigata , it must be baragon .
niigata , ikeda and fuji .
according to this latest data ... ... as i understand it ... ... we have another monster , apart from godzilla , moving underground .
that's impossible !
but we have proof .
this is definitely a living being .
yes , and even more incredible ... ... the locations concerned are exactly the locations ... ... that are mentioned in the legend .
you mean the guardian monsters , sir?
you know about the ancient legend too , sir?
it was a monster !
it was there in that cave , underground !
i tell you , it had a horrible head on it !
it's going to come and get us !
well , if you're sure about it , why not put it on your website?
but i'm telling you , it's true .
let me out !
it's godzilla !
attention mobile units .
we have a report that the monster causing the tremors has surfaced .
what is it?
the monster looks like godzilla !
godzilla !
the monster has come up .
it has what?
a guardian monster or godzilla?
the monster is at least 30 meters long .
it walks on all fours and has red skin .
it's moving through gotenba near mount fuji .
a red monster?
not godzilla?
the information we're receiving is still pretty confused .
but we do know that it's not godzilla .
i think we should send in the fighter squadron based at the coast .
the anti godzilla plan?
negative .
the latest reports coming in say the red godzilla is still on the move .
well , we'll soon be back in port .
hey , skip , red godzilla is at gotenba .
what do you mean?
godzilla isn't red !
it's heading this way , skipper .
go on .
get the lines ready .
what's going on?
look , there !
it's godzilla !
godzilla is at yaizu !
then what's that at gotenba?
all right , now , that's enough !
we must wait for confirmation .
we searched everywhere for it , but we just couldn't find it .
tell all army units to stand by .
godzilla has been confirmed at shimizu ... ... and is now reported to be heading northwards , sir !
all fighter units are on red alert .
ready to go , sir .
is there still time?
minister !
we have to wait for the cabinet's decision .
there's a huge lizard outside !
evacuate the shop immediately !
get out of here !
evacuate?
godzilla is just a legend .
godzilla .
children , we have to evacuate the school .
now clear your desks .
an atom bomb?
yuri .
so you're not afraid?
no , i want to see it .
the guardian monsters might attack us .
have you thought of that?
yuri?
have you got the stone?
in my bag .
you think it's an amulet?
godzilla has been heading towards the spa town of hakone .
a meeting of all cabinet ministers is now taking place ... ... to decide what measures should be taken for defense .
all defense personnel ...
follow the helicopter !
we'll never catch it in a car !
it'll lead us to godzilla , go on !
i'm sure it will !
that's it !
what do you mean?
i think i've found where that monster's heading .
where?
i think it's heading towards godzilla .
godzilla?
yes , sir , near hakone .
and at this rate , he'll be here tomorrow .
if we act immediately , we can place artillery at the sagami river .
but can we be sure he's heading this way?
i'm certain he is .
he's heading right for tokyo .
like last time .
but why?
why always here?
baragon sighted , sir , at hakone .
have they managed to evacuate everybody yet?
hey , look !
wow !
get a load of that monster !
it's enormous !
but quite cute , really .
hey , quick , take a photo , and then we'll run !
i think the monsters are gonna fight .
you sure?
look at that !
it's gonna be some fight !
look , the whole thing is live on the television .
in fact , godzilla is much bigger than i thought he'd be .
idiots !
get out of our airspace !
the red monster has suddenly disappeared underground !
godzilla's looking around .
he can't understand where his enemy's gone .
there are still hundreds of people in the area .
hey , where's the helicopter?
they've outsmarted us !
my god , it's godzilla !
it really is enormous !
look , there's our guardian monster .
our monster hasn't got a chance !
godzilla's kicking the red monster in the gravel pits !
the red monster is in big trouble !
it's terrible , i don't want to watch it !
shut up !
you're here to film , right?
so get filming !
quick , hurry up !
you're missing it .
right .
we have a real grandstand view of the rumble here .
godzilla puts the boot in again , and the red monster seems down and out !
the red monster has climbed out of the gravel pits !
it's trying to escape !
run !
he's right behind you !
go on , get out of there !
hurry !
they're dead .
the two men in the helicopter .
they're dead .
yuri !
look !
yuri !
earlier today , godzilla landed at yaizu ... ... and caused extensive damage in the shimizu and fuji areas .
later , godzilla moved on to the hakone area ... ... where it battled another unknown creature .
residents have been asked to leave the area calmly ...
what's up?
you lost your parents?
hey , miss , will we die?
no , don't worry .
everything's gonna work out fine .
and there's the guardian monsters .
they're here to help us .
hey , do you work for digital q?
yes , do you watch us?
tell me , miss ... ... are monsters real?
guardian monsters are , and they're here to save us .
so don't you worry .
everything's gonna be fine .
out of the way , please !
just scratches .
i'll be fine .
glad to hear it .
can i have the car keys?
no , you can't .
gee , thanks .
look , haven't you done enough , yuri?
now , a huge cocoon like structure is floating on the lake .
many people have gathered at the water's edge to see the sight .
the cocoon is the size of an ocean liner .
nobody has ever seen anything like it , and its origin remains a total mystery .
evacuate the area !
close all doors and windows ...
hello , i need a bicycle .
oh , well , i don't have any with baskets left .
i sold out of them a couple of hours ago .
right , this one .
the invoice made out to bs digital .
bs?
oh , bridgestone?
gen. mikumo , you shall lead the counterattack , understood?
thank you , sir .
i will not fail .
for security's sake , this shall be the command center .
dispatch fighter units immediately !
yes , sir !
that lizard picked the wrong guy here .
please evacuate in an orderly manner .
do not use your personal vehicles .
please proceed to regrouping areas ... ... where you will be given transportation to leave the area .
only take essential belongings .
therefore , the government has decided ... ... to use the army to counter the threat our country is under today ... ... and the necessary measures are now in place .
our counterattack operations are under way tonight .
bs digital .
yuri , babe !
hey , where are you?
i've got my camera with me .
i'm chasing godzilla .
sure , i'll send the pictures back over the net .
whatever you've got scheduled tonight , you better cancel it right now .
she's always doing the opposite of what she should be doing !
what has gotten into her?
we can't cancel it !
why can't we cancel?
if the boss asks , i said it's okay .
right , prepare to go live !
and i'll want an internet link too !
yuri , babe !
i want it straight from the lizard's mouth , okay?
hey , yuri !
take care !
okay .
missiles away !
this report comes to you from bs digital q tv ... ... bargain basement of the airwaves , and our star reporter ... ... on the scene near godzilla .
" bargain basement of the airwaves "?
take it away , yuri !
it's no good .
the missiles had no effect , sir .
try attacking it from the side .
it must have a weak point .
it's not going to make any difference !
blue leader , come in !
contact lost ...
well , sir?
we're awaiting your next order .
hey , look !
what's that?
hurry !
let's get out of here !
go back !
hurry !
well , minister?
in the '50s , did we really get rid of godzilla?
at the time , i doubted it ... ... but i taught my men to be proud of what they did .
i wonder , was it worth it?
godzilla is now moving east !
he's heading towards tokyo !
fifty years ago , the first godzilla attack was repulsed .
the animal was killed using an unknown chemical compound .
the inventor has since died and his records disappeared .
existing weapons were totally useless back then .
the defense forces could do nothing to stop godzilla .
so the government decided to keep what happened a secret .
if people knew the true story ... ... then our defense forces would have faced ridicule .
hence , the need for the utmost secrecy , understand?
so i'm relying on your discretion .
cmdr. tachibana , do you have a daughter called yuri?
yes , that's right .
hundreds of people have been killed by godzilla .
burned to death or trampled underfoot by the monster .
but there is resistance .
not only from our defense forces , but also from other monsters .
they're joining forces to stop godzilla .
stupid girl !
we'll try to protect her .
arrest her !
report from lake ikeda .
the cocoon has opened , sir !
what's that?
the thousand year old dragon ... ... ghidorah !
he wants to save us .
we've received news .
a new monster has been seen at mt .
fuji .
what the hell is going on?
it's like a monster convention here !
do we know where it is now?
it's heading east from mount fuji .
it's flying straight towards godzilla .
radar confirms the heading .
what's going to happen , commander?
the guardian monsters are gathering .
they're here to protect us from godzilla .
whatever happens , we must not attack the guardian monsters .
they are not our enemy .
why not name the monsters so we don't get them mixed up , general?
it would make things easier , sir .
well , it sounds a bit far fetched .
general .
i think i have an idea , general .
it seems several monsters are gathering in the area .
the red one will be code named baragon .
the flying insect , mothra ... ... and the golden monster code named ghidorah .
i repeat , the red one is baragon .
the flying insect is mothra .
the golden one is ghidorah .
capt. yamaguchi !
special intervention forces reporting for duty , sir !
we'll use the d3 warheads on all the missiles .
all right , captain , everybody to battle stations !
yes , sir !
remember to shut off all gas appliances .
leave your house lights on .
this will aid the military operation .
please evacuate in an orderly fashion .
proceed to regrouping areas and await transportation .
and good luck everybody !
yes , good luck everyone !
you're going to die !
it seems so calm .
yet , soon it will be reduced to a blazing pile of rubble .
the first time i've seen action .
i'm not looking forward to it .
but it's a soldier's duty .
we can go into battle without relishing conflict .
godzilla's here !
get those searchlights over here .
mothra !
man , that's one hell of a bug .
hey !
look , there it goes !
it's attacking godzilla !
yuri !
look out !
jesus , my buddies are in there !
what do we do?
nothing we can do !
please , sir .
the men are still waiting for your orders !
hold fire .
patience .
ghidorah?
the guardian monsters are here .
they're all here .
proceed into the bay !
we'll press our attack from both land and the sea .
moving into the bay , sir !
we'd better make sure our timing's right .
we won't get a second chance .
we'll wait until godzilla has been wounded , then we'll attack !
hey , where are you going?
you're off limits here !
come back here !
hey , stop !
let go !
leave me alone !
you're under arrest !
stop , let go of me !
stand by to commence attack !
all units ready to move !
all units , fire !
all units , fire !
all units , begin firing !
eighty percent destroyed !
no , 90 percent destroyed !
the aka , it's exploded !
and we're damaged too , sir !
i need a damage report !
right away , sir !
main guns destroyed , sir .
godzilla has seen us !
mothra !
thousand year old dragon , king ghidorah .
what the hell's going on out there?
godzilla and the other monster are fighting underwater .
godzilla seems to be wounded .
what i want to do is shoot a d3 into godzilla's wound .
it might just work .
the launchers are damaged .
we can't launch missiles !
i'll use the satsuma .
get one loaded onboard .
commander !
the satsuma is just a research vessel .
it's not designed for war .
with a d3 loaded on it , it's going to be very unstable .
we'll have to take that chance .
we don't have any choice !
you'll need cover , sir !
any torpedoes left?
a couple , sir .
then wish me luck .
good luck , sir .
the satsuma is attacking godzilla .
use all remaining firepower to cover the attack !
this has to succeed !
cmdr. tachibana is going to attack godzilla ... ... in a submersible using a d3 .
use all remaining firepower to cover the attack .
try to weaken godzilla as much as possible .
my father?
the captain says you can't stay here , miss .
can't someone else go?
why the commander?
he's a commander , a senior officer .
why does he have to go himself?
because i have the most experience .
father?
in these situations , a ship's commander has to lead by example .
now get to the safety area and stay low .
i've got a job to do !
don't you understand?
sure , i understand .
but you're my daughter .
is there a soldier there?
pass him to me .
commander?
soldier ... ... give the lady carte blanche .
but , sir !
i'll take responsibility .
sir .
you're allowed to stay , miss .
thanks ... ... dad .
you be careful .
yes , i will .
promise you'll come back alive .
of course i will .
don't worry .
i'll be fine .
stand by to launch submersible !
here , hold the camera .
what for?
to film me !
right !
we'll find out if you're our guardian , ghidorah .
commander , please come back safely .
the warriors have risen up to fight against godzilla ... ... with every weapon they can muster .
nobody knows if they'll succeed in their mission .
all i can do with my camera ... ... is to record their struggle ... ... to protect our freedom , regardless of danger ... ... so that our children ... ... will have a future .
yuri !
pull me up !
with any luck , the wound will still be warm .
switching to thermal imaging camera .
fry , you goddamn lizard !
great !
excellent !
let me go or we'll both fall !
i won't do it , i won't let go !
takeda .
damn you to hell !
watch out , commander !
move the ship to safety !
just let me take care of godzilla !
alone?
do as i say !
yuri !
ghidorah has been beaten .
baragon?
commander , don't !
give up !
abort the mission !
what's he doing?
please don't !
commander .
contact lost .
father?
father?
don't let him win .
yuri !
takeda !
thank goodness , you're alive .
my father !
where's my father?
my father !
yuri , thank you .
he succeeded !
he fired the missile !
godzilla , he's vanished !
godzilla's no longer on the radar .
he's gone !
he's disappeared completely !
i can't believe it !
and the sub?
he came back .
he came back !
the satsuma has surfaced .
cmdr. tachibana is alive .
situation is now code green .
repeat , code green .
aizu here .
do you read , salvage sub 2?
i read you .
let's go .
i'm coming , commander .
yes , that's right .
she works for us .
yuri tachibana .
yes !
thank you very much !
it's yuri .
she's okay .
guys !
wait !
why don't we do a special .
yeah , with all this material , we'll win all the awards !
what's more , we can include an interview ... ... with that professor " thingummy .
that's gonna be difficult .
why?
professor isayama died a long time ago ... ... after the first godzilla attack , in fact .
he was quite an old man .
he was 75 .
the professor is dead?
then who the hell was the old man?
whoever he was , he's gone from the tape .
you can't be serious .
are you all right?
don't come any closer !
i haven't checked the radiation levels yet .
father .
we'd better make sure .
don't , please .
it wasn't just me .
my colleagues ... ... and the guardian monsters .
