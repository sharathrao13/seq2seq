i've never heard of it that's myth
i'm just a simple fisherman
i'll only be blessed to make friends you'd be one what you guys from me?
i'm losing my territory are other animals moving in on you or something? the human kind .
they're cutting down our homes busting our families we hear they're cutting down the whole forest you're talking to the wrong person you gotta contact the nature groups like that has to be you you are the only one who know how to speak human we can't fight humans on my own they got guns , knives and pull out couches sure i got rabies , i can bite but i really can't do so much you guys have no idea what i'm talking about , do you? it's human against nature but with you on our side that'd be nice me on your side , i didn't say i was gonna help you
i didn't say it before you say no
i'd like you to see what we're talking about
it's gone everything gone
how do you save the forest anyway? it's not gonna be easy
i assume the lumber companies have a lot of crowd but i do know a few endangered species living in the forest who definitely have lost the protective how am i gonna find how many endangered animals living in the forest you can ask eugine we find the endangered species the females killed by the poachers it's the only western pacific bear at least one bear has to be protected , right?
let the lawyer of the logging company argue this since she is the only up there there's no chance for survival anyway there had to be a male too so we get a male up there and let them together
let nature take its course the only male western pacific bear we can find is raised in captivity never has a bear raised in captivity been successfully reintroduced to the wild they never have a world famous doctor make an introduction your man left the button open something wrong?
i hope he didn't see it
i know you're really disappointed disappointed? about not going to europe? why'd i be disappointed?
i made you a promise and i'm gonna stick to it you don't want me to it
i understand if i say no .
i'll regret for the rest of my life when do we leave? as soon as we get the court order to stop the tree cutting who is going to argue the case?
why are you looking around? me? not me , you
for the animals
i don't do the animals you are a speciest we're asking for an injunction so that we might the chance to save the species this is a delaying tactic a publicity stunt
i have an afidavit signed a range of experts who'll take them a bear raised in captivity is reintroduced to the wild it's dangerous and irresponsible simply raised by a circus who don't know how to feed
let alone let it through its first winter it 'll certainly succumb to darwin's law of nature survival of the fittest but darwin never met my dad young lady , that's inappropriate behavior who's your father? it's me .
i'm her father my name is dolittle doctor dolittle do you feel you can rehabilitate and make it in the wild for the female? yes i do in that case i'll delay one month
one month , that's it if that bear is capsized in this month
i'll dismiss the order
i understand completely thank you your honor
you can speak with the wild animals and the circus bears?
i don't know much about it
i only know it's living in captivity
i bet they'll be happy to return to the wild
so much for a family vacation can doctor figure how much it's gonna be? that's before he met acher
you know what i'm talking about? no , listen . you'll be lucky winning somebody like her
i've had so many girlfriends
i never have a girlfriend just bring her by on monday
i can't her here you have to go to her go to her , where? she is in the forest
i don't play in the forest do you what kind of beer you are?
i'm a singer , dancer you're an endangered species is that a threat?
cos my lawyer . . . you're a very rare bear .
you're called the western pacific bear
i know i can play any bears western , polar

i have my own baby you do this i promise you'll be the most famous bear in the world famous that pooh are you kidding me? you pull this off and you're saying
winnie the who? you got yourself a bear? and what's the most unusual story of the year doctor dolittle is going to rewrite the law of nature by tempting to reintroduce a performing bear into the wild and in doing do hoped to save an entire force from destruction it's darwin versus dolittle get over yourself
i got 2 lumber millers waiting for that wood
i understand but it's complicated especially if that bear survives you're the one who's going to be endangered that bear is bound to screw up when he does , have yourselves a little toy
i have just the place to put it
so we're going to the forest waiting for acher to arrive when the family's settled
i'm starting to look for mount number one
looks like a good place simple pleasure that woof is a fox
you like that there's more where i came from
what is that? some kinda secret lady dog's code you like me? this is called back scratching

i have a feeling the fur is gonna fly you all know why we're here we're about to do something we've never done before everyone thinks we can't pull this off they got their blaze sharpened truck ready to roll we're going to prove them wrong , right?
i want everybody to put their claw together how about an applause for the bear who is going to leave?

what happened?
it's acher folks we got a wild animal coming through
i'm doctor dolittle what happened? he broke down the back door we found him ransacking in the kitten
let's move up show is over it's me what happened?
i was so close they came out of no where are you ready to save the forest?
we're setting aside 1 0 acres of the forest we cal it doctor wild life sanctuary speak of the devil you think you've won but you haven't
thanks very much .
that's all for today
we only have an eyewitness did anybody see what happened? we got one problem it's a freaking weasel what did he do?
weasel , the doctor is here
did you see what happen to the bear?
you give me your watch i'll tell you what you need to know you're such a weasel
an animal?
you can't offer them evidence you got a better idea?
i'll stall the trial maybe we hire a private investigator they're going to take acher to mexico if you go on the witness stand
riley is going to tear you to shreds what do i have to lose? your reputation
i'm not giving up these animals easy
we admit it was a setback but we'd like one more week to rehabitate the bear
what if i could prove the entire thing is a setup?
that'd be a very serious allegation do you intend to present the evidence? we have an eyewitness can i address to the court just a minute?
we have an eyewitness who can testify he heard the gunshot and a truck back to the area is that witness here in the court? it's not in the court cos he's . . .
he's a weasel
i know this seems very unreasonable
i can talk to animals this did come forward
i have no problem doctor dolittle to question the witness
i'd like a brief recess so that i'll have an opportunity to get a camera to have a snapshot if he needs immunity we can provide animal protection
i'd not allow you to make a mockery in my courtroom the deadline has passed the motion to delay is denied that's a shame
could you tell us what the weasel wanted to say?
you come to get me out?
what do you mean sort of?
i couldn't prove your story they what?
they think you'd be too dangerous to be set free
they sold you to a mexican circus
everything .
i dragged you out and put you through all this stuff
like i've ruined your life you gave me a life you even taught me about love no one can ever take that away from me
mama wanted me to tell you that the appeal's been denied
you're back to your show business
i just want eva maybe i wasn't meant to be loved everybody is meant to be loved
since when? a couple of weeks ago at first i was kinda fuzzy now i'm really clear this is what you've been keeping from us right? don't say anything cos i don't want to be a freak you're not gonna be a freak when it started to happen to me
i got scared too this is a good thing

i guess it's something i'll never have you gotta help him isn't there something that we can do?
not just him i mean all the animal so many of them
there are so many of them
you guys have given up haven't you? what am i gonna do , i'm 6 years old
i am not a young beaver no more beside , we've been living in this forest how long? about 1 00 years we've been shacking in the forest
i can't do this by myself you guys wanna save your home you gotta help me whether you'll believe it you guys have untapped power
you got a heart of the lion or just strong like an ox eyes like an eagle movement swift like a gazette or you stink like a skunk sorry , i'm trying to make my point here what i'm trying to say is we can do this just don't do it without a fight
listen don't stall with me everybody take your position
roll them up
i have never seen anything like this before none of them're having milk
what's wrong? strike
go get the fribee
strike
all the animals are working together you'll be out of here in no time animals can't organize you may want to take a look at this yourself
maybe you should talk to dolittle giving in to a bunch of beasts lowering our life form?
i can take democrats
i can take animals
retreat organized
i heard something
don't make any move
you locked the door
i think you should run
i'm an attorney .
i'm not with him
i'm sure we can work something out
i'm gonna call doctor dolittle no sudden move or i'm gonna bite you
mr , potter , how are you sir?
i'm here with a couple of your friends
i don't think you believe animals'd organize
i don't know what to think anymore
i'll be happy to set up a meeting with you and the animals so that we can work out our problem it's the only way for you to admit so you won't look like an idiot just call them off put the raccoon on the phone he wants to speak to you make it short
i got it all under control
i'll call you back
i'm here only a mediator this negotiation is between mr potter the representatives of the local wildlife this is my new proposal what kind of territory we're looking at only 1 2 acres here

meanwhile the strike kept rolling even the pros're getting in on the act

i don't feel like jumping any hoops today
hope you'll fill in there
