no .
we spoke on the net last night .
now you've seen me ...
i wasn't on the net last night .
where were you between 6 : 45 and 7 : 00 p . m .?
that's really none of your business .
where were you?
on the net , talking to you .
well , i was talking to someone .
someone pretending to be me .
i think you were talking to daniel woolf .
who?
this guy i know .
it's him .
no , i was talking to a woman .
how do you know?
believe me , she was a woman .
i got a huge ...
she was a ...
she wasn't , was she?
no .
what a bastard .
how do you know him?
i don't really know him .
i took his photograph for a book he wrote .
i hope it sank without a trace .
it's on its way .
there is justice in the world .
what's it called?
the aquarium .
what a prick !
he's advertising .
but why would he pretend to be you?
i think he likes me .
funny way of showing it .
can't he send you flowers?
extraordinary thing , the internet .
possibility of genuine global communication .
the first great democratic medium .
absolutely .
it's the future .
two guys wanking in cyberspace .
he was the wanker .
i'll say this for him , he can write .
is he in love with you?
i don't know .
no .
are you in love with him?
i hardly know him .
but you're sort of interested .
i think he's interesting .
no , don't .
i look like a criminal in photos .
please .
it's my birthday .
really?
really .
happy birthday .
thank you .
hey , waitress , what are you waiting for?
funny guy .
so i go , " i'm waiting for a man to come in here ...
and fuck me sideways with a beautiful line like that .
what did he do?
asked for a cup of tea with two sugars .
i'm waiting for you .
to do what?
leave me .
i'm not going to leave you .
i totally love you .
why is this?
please let me come .
i want to be there for you .
are you ashamed of me?
of course not .
i told you ...
i want to be alone .
why?
to grieve .
to think .
i love you .
why won't you let me?
it's only a weekend .
why won't you let me love you?
buster .
let's go to this thing ... then i'll get my train .
i'll be away one night .
i'll be back before you know it , okay?
do these people pay you?
or do you pay them?
like it?
no .
what were you so sad about?
life .
what's that , then?
so what do you reckon , in general?
you want to talk about art?
i know it's vulgar to discuss the work at an opening of the work ... but someone's got to do it .
i'm serious .
what do you think?
it's a lie .
it's a bunch of sad strangers photographed beautifully ... and all the glittering assholes who appreciate art ... say it's beautiful because that's what they want to see .
but the people in the photos are sad ... and alone .
but the pictures make the world seem beautiful ... so the exhibition's reassuring , which makes it a lie .
and everyone loves a big , fat lie .
i'm the big , fat liar's boyfriend .
bastard .
larry .
alice .
so you're anna's boyfriend .
a princess can kiss a toad .
frog .
toad .
frog .
toad , frog , lobster .
they're all the same .
so how long have you been seeing her?
four months .
we're in the first flush .
it's paradise .
all my nasty habits amuse her .
you shouldn't smoke .
fuck off .
i'm a doctor .
i'm supposed to say things like that .
you want one?
no .
yes .
no .
fuck it , yes .
no .
i've given up .
anna tells me your bloke wrote a book .
any good?
of course .
it's about you , isn't it?
some of me .
oh?
what did he leave out?
the truth .
is he here , your bloke?
yeah , he's over there talking to your bird .
my boyfriend's here .
he's here?
where?
there .
with alice?
i believe you're acquainted .
i've never seen him before .
no .
but you've spoken .
well , conversed .
corresponded .
i wrote to him?
on the net .
you sent him to the aquarium .
i happened to be there .
nice work , cupid .
we need to talk about this .
no , we don't .
he's very pretty .
she is very tall .
so you're a stripper?
yeah .
and?
you take care , now .
i will .
you , too .
that's the way it should be .
he's very funny .
excuse me .
nice to meet you .
pleased with the success?
yes , absolutely .
yours was the best .
you were the belle of the bullshit .
who were those awful people?
where do they come from?
why should we care?

you'll miss your train .
i'll be fine .
come on , it's cold .
i'll see you on sunday .

why don't you make up your bleeding mind?
thank you so much .
i appreciate your coming .
i'll call you tomorrow .

thanks very much .
i thought you'd gone .
i forgot this .
so he's a dermatologist .
can you get more boring than that?
obituarist?
failed novelist , please .
i was sorry about your book .
thanks .
i blame the title .
so we pull out our christmas crackers with those appalling jokes .
my guy says , " hang on .
these are second rate jokes .
i've got a first rate joke .
sit back and take notice .
so we go , " okay , what's the joke?
it's based on a christmas carol ...
which is why it seems so relevant on christmas day .
i haven't even seen you for a year .
yes , you have .
only because you stalk me outside my studio .
i don't stalk .
i lurk .
and when i'm not there you look for me .
how do you know if you're not there?
because i am there ...
lurking from a distance .
look at me .
tell me you're not in love with me .
i'm not in love with you .
you just lied .
i'm your stranger .
jump .
hello , stranger .
hello .
intense conversation?
his father died .
were you spying?
lovingly observing ... with a telescope .
he's taller than in his photo .
his photo's a headshot .
yeah , i know .
but his head implied a short body , when , in fact , his head is deceptive .
deceptive?
he's actually got a long body .
he's a stringy fucker .
i could have him .
what?
lf it came to it , in a scrap , i could have him .
did you tell him we call him cupid?
no , that's our joke .
i had a chat with young alice .
fancy her?
of course .
not as much as you .
why not?
you're a woman .
she's a girl .
she has the moronic beauty of youth , but she's sly .
she seems open to me .
that's how she wants to seem .
you forget you're dealing with a clinical observer of the human carnival .
am i , now?
yes .
you seem more like the cat that got the cream .
stop licking yourself .
that's the nastiest thing you've ever said to me .
that's horrible .
i'm sorry .
i'm so sorry .
where have you been?
work thing .
had a drink with harry .
you never have one drink with harry .
you know he's in love with you .
no , he's not .
is he?
did you eat?
i'll make you something .
i'm not hungry .
what?
this will hurt .
i've been with anna .
i'm in love with her .
we've been seeing each other for a year .
it began at her opening .
have a nice one .
cheers , guvnor .
don't move .
i want to remember this moment forever .
first time i walked through the door , returning from a business trip ... to be greeted by my wife .
i have , in this moment , become an adult .
thanks for waiting up , you darling .
you goddess .
i missed you .
how about some tea?
jesus , i'm knackered !
didn't you sleep on the plane?
no ... because the permed german next to me was snoring like a messerschmitt .
what's the time?
about midnight .
time .
what a tricky little fucker .
my head's in two places .
my brain actually hurts .
do you want some food?
no , i need a bath .
i'll run it for you .
no , i'll have a shower .
you okay?
how was the thing?
as dermatological conferences go , it was a riot .
how was the hotel?
someone told me that the beautiful people of the paranoid hotel ... the concierge , the bellboys and girls ...
did you know this?
they're all whores .
everybody knows that .
i didn't .
i don't suppose you'd fancy a friendly poke .
i just had a bath .
right .
i'll see to myself , then , in the elle decoration bathroom .
you chose that bathroom .
and every time i wash in it i feel dirty .
it's cleaner than i am .
it's got attitude .
the mirror says , " who the fuck are you?
you chose it .
doesn't mean i like it .
we shouldn't have this .
i hear middle class guilt .
working class guilt .
why are you dressed if you just had a bath?
we needed some milk .
you okay?
you?
yeah .
i'm going .
i'm sorry .
irrelevant .
what are you sorry for?
everything .
why didn't you tell me before?
cowardice .
is it because she's successful?
no , it's because she doesn't need me .
did you bring her here?
yes .
didn't she get married?
she stopped seeing me .
is that when we went to the country?
to celebrate our third anniversary?
did you phone her?
beg her to come back?
when you went for your long , lonely walks?
yes .
you're a piece of shit .
deception is brutal .
i'm not pretending otherwise .
how?
how does it work?
how do you do this to someone?
not good enough .
i fell in love with her , alice .
as if you had no choice?
there's a moment .
there's always a moment .
i can do this , i can give in to this , or i can resist it .
and i don't know when your moment was , but i bet you there was one .
i'm going .
it's not safe out there .
and it's safe in here?
what about your things?
i don't need things .
where will you go?
disappear .
the sultan has returned bearing gifts .
thank you .
they're beautiful .
here's a thing .
alice was at the hotel .
what?
they sell these arty postcards in the lobby .
i bought one to boost your sales .
young woman , london .
and i checked for your book in the museum of modern art .
it was there .
someone bought one .
this guy with a ridiculous little beard .
he was drooling over your photo on the inside cover .
he fancied you , the geek .
i was so proud of you .
you've broken new york .
you're wonderful .
don't ever forget it .
can i still see you?
dan , can i still see you?
answer me .
i can't see you .
if i see you , i'll never leave you .
what will you do if i find someone else?
be jealous .
you still fancy me?
of course .
you're lying .
i've been you .
will you hold me?
i amuse you , but i bore you .
no .
you did love me?
i'll always love you .
i hate hurting you .
then why are you?
'cause i'm selfish .
and i think i'll be happier with her .
you won't .
you'll miss me .
no one will ever love you as much as i do .
why isn't love enough?
i'm the one who leaves .
i'm supposed to leave you .
make some tea , buster .
why are you dressed?
because i think you might be about to leave me ... and i didn't want to be wearing a dressing gown .
i slept with someone in new york .
a whore .
i'm sorry .
why did you tell me?
i couldn't lie to you .
why not?
because i love you .
it's fine .
really?
why?
something's wrong .
tell me .
are you leaving me?
because of this?
why?
dan .
cupid?
he's our joke .
i love him .
you're seeing him now?
since when?
since my opening last year .
i'm disgusting .
you're phenomenal .
you're so clever .
why did you marry me?
i stopped seeing him .
i wanted us to work .
why did you tell me you wanted children?
because i did .
and now you want children with him?
yes .
i don't know .
but we're happy ... aren't we?
you're gonna go live with him?
you stay here if you want .
i don't give a fuck about the spoils .
you did this to me the day we met .
you let me hang myself for your amusement .
why didn't you just tell me when i walked in the door?
i was scared .
you're a coward , you spoilt bitch .
are you dressed because you thought i might hit you?
what do you think i am?
i've been hit before .
not by me .
is he a good fuck?
don't do this .
just answer the question .
is he good?
yes .
better than me?
different .
better?
gentler .
what does that mean?
you know what it means .
tell me .
no .
i treat you like a whore?
sometimes .
why would that be?
i'm sorry , you're ...
don't say it .
you're too good for me .
i am , but don't say it .
you're making the mistake of your life .
you're leaving me because you believe that you don't deserve happiness ... but you do , anna .
did you have a bath because you had sex with him?
so you wouldn't smell of him?
so you'd feel less guilty?
how do you feel?
guilty .
did you ever love me?
yes .
did you do it here?
no .
why not?
do you wish we did?
just tell me the truth .
yes , we did it here .
where?
there .
on this?
we had our first fuck on this .
did you think of me?
when?
when did you do it here?
answer the question !
this evening .
did you come?
why are you doing this?
'cause i want to know .
yes , i came .
how many times?
twice .
how?
first he went down on me , then we fucked .
who was where?
i was on top , then he fucked me from behind .
that's when you came the second time?
god .
why is the sex so important?
because i'm a fucking caveman !
did you touch yourself while he fucked you?
you wank for him?
sometimes .
and he does?
we do everything ...
that people who have sex do .
you enjoy sucking him off?
you like his cock?
i love it .
like him coming in your face?
yes !
what does it taste like?
like you , but sweeter .
that's the spirit .
thank you .
thank you for your honesty .

i love you .
thank you .

the paradise suite .

no .
but if you want to tip me , you're welcome .

i used to come here a million years ago .
it was a punk club .
the stage was ...
everything is a version of something else .
twenty years ago .
how old were you?
four .
christ .

three months .
straight after he left you?
no one left me .
nice wig .
thank you .
does all this turn you on?
sometimes .
liar .
you're telling me that 'cause you think it's what i want to hear .
you think i'm turned on by it turning you on .
the thought of me creaming myself when i strip for strangers doesn't turn you on?
put like that , yes .
are you flirting with me?
maybe .
are you allowed to flirt with me?
sure .
really?
no , i'm not .
i'm breaking all the rules .
you're mocking me .
yes , i'm allowed to flirt .
to prize my money from me .
to prize your money from you , i may do or say as i please .
except touch .
we're not allowed to touch .
open your legs .
wider .
show me .
so what would happen if i touched you now?
i'd call security .
what would they do?
they would ask you to leave and not to come back .
and if i refused to leave?
they would remove you .
those are security cameras in the ceiling .
i think it's best i don't attempt to touch you .
i'd like to touch you .
later .
i'm not a whore .
i wouldn't pay .
why the fuck did he leave you?
what's your job?
a question .
you asked me a question .
so?
it's a chink in your armor .
i'm not wearing armor .
yes , you are .
why are you calling yourself jane?
because it's my name .
we both know it isn't .

pluto .
you're cheeky .
would you like me to stop being cheeky?
no .
what's your name?

daniel the dermatologist .
i never told you my job .
i guessed .
you're strong .
there's another one out there .
judging by the scars , a patient of dr. tit .
calls herself cupid .
who's gonna tell her he was a bloke?
he wasn't a bloke .
he was a little boy .
i want you to tell me your name .
please .
thank you .
my name is jane .
your real name .
thank you .
my real name is jane .
careful .
thank you .
still jane .
i've got about another 500 here .
why don't i just give you all this money and you tell me what your real name is ...
alice?
i promise .
thank you .
my real name ... is plain jane jones .
i may be rich , but i'm not stupid .
what a shame , doc .
i love them rich and stupid .
don't you fuck around with me .
i apologize .
accepted .
all the girls in this hellhole , the pneumatic robots ... the coked up baby dolls , and you're no different .
you all use stage names to con yourselves you're someone else ... so you don't feel ashamed showing your cunts and assholes to strangers .
i'm trying to have a conversation .
you're out of cash .
i paid for this room .
this is extra .
we met last year .
wrong girl .
talk to me !
i am .
talk to me in real life .
i didn't know you'd be here .
i know who you are .
i love you .
i love everything about you that hurts .
she won't even see me .
you feel the same .
i know it .
you can't cry in here .
hold me .
let me hold you .
we're not allowed to touch .
come home with me .
it's safe .
let me look after you .
i don't need looking after .
everyone needs looking after .
i'm not your revenge fuck .
i'll pay you .
i don't need your money .
you have my money .
thank you .
" thank you . " is that some kind of rule?
just being polite .
do you get a lot of grown men crying their guts out here?
occupational hazard .
have you ever desired a customer?
yes .
then put me out of my misery .
do you desire me?
because i'm being pretty honest about my feelings for you .
your feelings?
whatever .
no , i don't desire you .
thank you .
thank you sincerely for your honesty .
you think you haven't give us anything of yourselves?
do you think because you don't love us or desire us ... or even like us , you think you've won?
it's not a war .
if i asked you to strip right now , would you?
of course .
do you want me to?
no .
alice , tell me something true .
lying is the most fun a girl can have without taking her clothes off ... but it's better if you do .
you're cold .
you're all cold at heart .
what do you have to do to get a bit of intimacy around here?
maybe next time i'll have worked on my intimacy .
no , i'll tell you what's gonna work .
you're gonna take your gear off right now .
you're gonna turn around very slowly , and you're gonna bend over ... and you're gonna touch the fucking floor for my viewing pleasure .
is that what you want?
what else could i want?
i'm sorry .
what happened?
traffic .
do you want to go stand in the back?
no , let's have a drink .
you look flushed .
you have no need to run .
vodka tonic?
yes .
vodka tonic and a guinness , please .
sure .
how was it?
fine .
you had lunch?
then what?
and then we left .
and?
there's no " and .
you haven't seen him in four months .
there must be an " and .
how is he?
terrible .
keep the change .
thank you , sir .
how is his dermatology?
he's in private practice now .
is he?
was he weeping all over the place?
some of the time .
poor bastard .
was he difficult?
are you angry that i saw him?
no .
it's just ...
i haven't seen alice .
you can't see alice .
you don't know where she is .
i haven't tried to find her .
you know why i saw him .
he's been begging me for months .
i saw him so he'd sign .
so has he signed?
yes .
congratulations .
you're a divorce .
double divorce .
sorry .
how do you feel?
tired .
i love you .
and i need a piss .
i hate this place .
at least it's central .
i hate central .
central london's a theme park .
i hate retro .
i hate the future .
where does that leave me?
come back .
you promised you wouldn't .
come back .
how's work?
jesus .
work's shit , okay?
do they have waiters here?
i love you .
please come back .
i'm not coming back .
sign .
no pen .
pen .
give me back my hand .
sign .
i'll sign on one condition .
we skip this .
we go to my sleek new surgery ... and we christen the patients 'bed with our final fuck .
i know you don't want to ... and i know you think i'm sick for asking , but that's what i'm asking .
for old times 'sake .
because i'm obsessed with you .
because i can't get over you unless ...
because i think , on some small level ... you owe me something for deceiving me so exquisitely .
for all these reasons , i am begging you to give me your body .
you'd be my whore .
and in return , i will pay you with your liberty .
you do this , i swear i will not contact you again .
i'm going to the bar .
i assume you still drink vodka tonic?
you slept with him , didn't you?
what do you expect me to do?
understand .
why didn't you lie to me?
because we said we'd always tell each other the truth .
what's so great about the truth?
try lying for a change .
it's the currency of the world .
i did what he wanted , and now he will leave us alone .
i love you .
i didn't give him anything .
your body?
if alice came to you , desperate ... with all that love still between you ... and she said she needed you to want her ... so she could get over you , you'd do it .
i wouldn't like it either , but i'd forgive you .
it's kindness .
no , cowardice .
you haven't got the guts to let him hate you .
i'm doing this because i feel guilty , and because i pity you .
you know that , don't you?
yes .
feel good about yourself?
no .
it's gone .
we're not innocent anymore .
don't stop loving me .
i can see it draining out of you .
it's me , remember?
it was a stupid thing to do , and it meant nothing .
if you love me enough , you'll forgive me .
are you testing me?
no .
i do understand .
no .
he understands .
all i can see is him all over you .
he's clever , your ex husband .
i almost admire him .
you going to tell him?
i don't know .
better to be truthful about this kind of thing .
sign .
i forgive you .
sign .
i think you enjoyed it .
he wheedles you into bed .
the old jokes ... the strange familiarity .
i think you had a whale of a time .
and the truth is i'll never know unless i ask him .
why don't you?
yes?
you can go in now .
i want anna back .
she's made her choice .
i owe you an apology .
i fell in love with her .
my intention was not to make you suffer .
so where's the apology?
you cunt .
i apologize .
if you love her , you'll let her go ... so she can be happy .
she doesn't want to be happy .
everybody wants to be happy .
depressives don't .
they want to be unhappy to confirm they're depressed .
if they were happy , they couldn't be depressed .
they'd have to go out into the world and live , which can be depressing .
anna's not a depressive .
isn't she?
i love her .
boo hoo .
so do i.
she's gone back to you because she can't bear your suffering .
you don't know who she is .
you love her like a dog loves its owner .
and the owner loves the dog for so doing .
you'll hurt her .
you'll never forgive her .
of course i forgive her .
i have forgiven her .
without forgiveness we're savages .
you're drowning .
you only met her because of me .
yeah .
thanks .
it's a joke .
your marriage is a joke .
here's a good one .
she never sent the divorce papers to her lawyer .
now , to a towering romantic hero like you , i don't doubt i am somewhat common .
but i am , nevertheless , what she has chosen ... and we must respect what the woman wants .
if you go near her again , i swear ...
i will kill you .
okay .
i have patients to see .
when she came here , do you think she enjoyed it?
i didn't do it to give her a nice time .
i fucked her to fuck you up .
a good fight is never clean .
and of course she enjoyed it .
as you know , she loves a guilty fuck .
you're an animal .
yeah?
what are you?
you think love is simple .
you think the heart is like a diagram .
have you ever seen a human heart?
it looks like a fist wrapped in blood !
go fuck yourself .
you writer !
you liar !
you go check a few facts while i get my hands dirty .
she hates your hands .
she hates your simplicity .
i spent the whole of last week talking about you .
i know all your ways .
anna says you fucked her with your eyes closed .
she tells me you wake in the night crying for your mother , you mommy's boy .
i could go on .
shall we stop this?
it's over .
accept it .
you don't know the first thing about love ... because you don't understand compromise .
don't cry on me .
i'm sorry .
i don't know what to do .
you want my advice?
you go back to alice .
she'd never have me .
she's vanished .
no , she hasn't .
i found her , by accident .
she's working in a club .
yes , i saw her naked .
no , i did not fuck her .
you spoke to her?
yes , i know .
one minute .
how is she?
she loves you ... beyond comprehension .
your prescription .
it's where she works .
go to her .
thank you .
you still pissing about on the net?
not recently .
i wanted to kill you .
i thought you wanted to fuck me .
don't get lippy .
i liked your book , by the way .
thanks .
you stand alone .
with anna .
you still writing obituaries?
busy?
i was made editor .
yeah?
how come?
previous editor died .
alcohol poisoning .
i sat with him for a week in the hospital .
i really do have patients to see .
thank you .
for what?
being kind .
i am kind .
your invoice is in the post .
i lied to you .
i did fuck alice .
sorry for telling you .
i'm just not big enough to forgive you .
buster .
show me the sneer .
beautiful .
you'll wake up the hotel .
fuck me .
again?
we have to get up at 6 : 00 .
how can one man be so endlessly disappointing?
that's my charm .
so where are we going?
my treat .
where are we going?
my holiday surprise .
my rules .
where are we going?
new york .
you angel .
you did remember to pack my passport?
of course .
it's with my passport .
and where's that?
in a place where you can't look .
no one sees my passport picture .
when we get on the plane , we'll have been together four years .
what about the gap?
you mean trial separation?
didn't work out .
happy anniversary .
i'm going to take my eyes out .
what was in my sandwiches?
tuna .
how many stitches did i get?
two .
but you should have had three .
what was your euphemism?
disarming .
too easy , buster .
next?
that park .
who'd i go there with?
your father .
were the chairs in the hospital gray or blue?
no idea .
trick question .
they were green .
you are a trick question .
how come we never took a vacation?
we went to the country .
doesn't count .
you were off making sneaky phone calls ... to that witch we do not mention .
come to bed .
i need a smoke .
how'd you manage to give up?
deep inner strength .
why me?
you could have chosen anyone .
why me?
because you cut off your crusts .
and this .
when are you going to stop stripping?
soon .
you're addicted to it .
no , i'm not .
it paid for this .
tell me what happened .
nothing happened .
but he came to the club .
lots of men come to the club .
you came to the club .
the look on your face .
the look on your face .
what a face .
what a wig .
i saw this face ... this vision ... when you stepped into the road .
it was the moment of my life .
this is the moment of your life .
you were perfect .
i still am .
on the way to the hospital ...
i kissed your forehead .
you brute .
the cabbie saw me kissing you .
he said , " is she yours?
i said , " yes , she's mine .
she's mine .
so he came to the club , watched you strip , you had a little chat , and that was it?
yes .
you're not trusting me .
i'm in love with you .
you're safe .
you had every right .
i just want to know .
why?
because i want to know everything .
because i'm a lunatic .
tell me .
nothing happened .
you were living with someone else .
what are you justifying?
i'm not justifying anything .
just saying .
what are you saying?
i'm not saying anything .
i just want the truth .
where are you going?
cigarettes .
everywhere's closed .
i'll go to the terminal .
when i get back ... please tell me the truth .
why?
because i'm addicted to it .
because without it we're animals .
trust me .
i don't love you anymore .
since when?
now .
just now .
i don't want to lie ... and i can't tell the truth ... so it's over .
it doesn't matter .
i love you .
none of it matters .
too late .
i don't love you anymore .
goodbye .
here's the truth ... so now you can hate me .
larry fucked me all night .
i enjoyed it .
i came .
i prefer you .
now go .
i knew that .
he told me .
you knew?
i needed to hear it from you .
why?
because he might have been lying .
i had to hear it from you .
i would never have told you , because i know you'd never forgive me .
i would .
i have .
why did he tell you?
because he's a bastard .
how could he?
because he wanted this to happen .
but why test me?
because i'm an idiot .
yes .
i would have loved you ... forever .
now please go .
don't do this .
talk to me .
i am talking .
fuck off .
no , i'm sorry .
you misunderstand .
i didn't mean to ...
yes , you did .
i love you .
where?
what?
show me .
where is this love?
i can't see it .
i can't touch it .
i can't feel it .
i can hear it .
i can hear some words ... but i can't do anything with your easy words .
whatever you say , it's too late .
please don't do this .
it's done .
now please go , or i'll call security .
you're not in a strip club .
there is no security .
why did you fuck him?
i wanted to .
why?
i desired him .
why?
you weren't there .
why him?
he asked me nicely .
you're a liar .
so?
who are you?
i'm no one .
go on , hit me .
that's what you want .
hit me , fucker .
welcome back , miss jones .
thank you .
