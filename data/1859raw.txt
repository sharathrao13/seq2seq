<i>thanks for last night . </ i>
<i>l'm at the airport . </ i>
<i>my flight is in an hour . </ i>
<i>l'll miss you . </ i>
<i>we had a good fuck . </ i>
<i>kisses . </ i>
what can i say?
that was the boring side .
you can't really judge in one hour .
what did you tell thierry?
what he wanted to hear .
he can't care anyway .
he believed you .
even better .
i've got a headache .
taken an aspirine ...
did you find your mobile?
yes .
there were messages on it .
i didn't listen to them i didn't delete them .
a woman saying goodbye .
were you with her last night?
no .
listen to your message .
its clear .
do you listen to my messages?
did you spend the night with her?
no .
where were you then?
who is she?
its a girl ...
a crazy case .
nobody .
has it been going on for long?
it was of no importance .
of no importance?
come on !
catherine , its not worth it .
ok , you don't have to say anything .
i thought you placed yourself higher .
what?
does it happen so often then?
of course not .
not often .
but once in a while , yes .
its ridiculous , thats why i'm not telling you .
is that the reason?
i understand you're hurt , but ...
if you'd know how i'd feel ...
i don't care !
you're right .
maybe we talk too little .
but you don't say anything about yourself either .
we've grown away from each other .
you've grown away .
don't talk about me .
its true .
we don't make love anymore don't touch anymore ...
i don't know if its because of me or you .
maybe its unavoidable ...
and one day it dies away .
i hope not .
how is it going then with those women?
what do you like?
actually i don't know anything about it .
i'm not going to tell you how i ...
yes you are .
then we'll share something .
what do you mean?
i can leave you immediately too .
catherine .
are you looking for somebody?
no .
can i do something for you?
this is a private club .
a whiskey please .
sit over there .
the whiskey , with perrier?
no , pure .
you always get things in your mind .
you're so irritating .
who did you get that from?
from my sweetheart .
you're in a hurry aren't you?
a glass of water , i'm hot .
its quiet tonight .
yea , it will get started .
d'you want ice?
yes please .
its fine like that .
there aren't any people yet .
when does it usually start?
eleven , half twelve .
d'you offer me something to drink?
if you want .
everthing fine?
not too strange?
its okey .
which perfume d'you have on?
jicky .
it suits you .
i constantly change .
did you just come in by coincidence?
no , not really .
i work in the neighbourhood .
you seldom see women here .
women like you i mean .
probably .
couples yes , but a woman alone ...
would you prefer that i leave you alone?
no .
maybe ... you can help me .
why not .
tell me .
some girls don't go with women .
i do .
its not for me .
for who then?
i think ... that my husband would like you ...
you choose in his place?
can't he come himself?
no .
why not?
is he handicapped?
d'you want a threesome?
no , he knows nothing about this .
didn't you recognise me?
i wasn't sure .
a coffee please .
his name is bernard .
<i>he often goes for a coffe</ i> <i>before work . </ i>
<i>how shall i describe him? </ i>
<i>he wears a blue scarf, </ i> <i>a dark jacket . </ i>
<i>a couple of newspapers ... </ i>
<i>he is big , brown hair , strong . </ i>
<i>you could call him attractive . </ i>
<i>and if he asks what i do? </ i>
<i> you learn languages to become a translator . </ i>
excuse me , d'you have a light?
i was asking for a light .
and i sat down again .
he pretended as if he was reading .
but then he stood up , and approached me .
what did he say?
the usual .
if i cam there often , to my work ...
i told him about the language courses .
he said he had to go to an appointment and asked for my name .
i didn't answer .
we have to think of a name .
i don't know if marlne is your real name .
we'll call you ...
nathalie ... yes , nathalie .
what does your husband like?
what gives him pleasure?
he has his own wishes .
its always free between us ... been classic .
maybe he likes to be hugged .
how did he look at you?
he fell fast .
you chose well .
shall i pay you now?
yes .
you can check .
no , its fine .
how are you getting home , yolaine?
with a taxi .
no , i'll give you a lift .
this dinner has to unify our loneliness we both have .
but it doesn't subject you to anything of course .
come .
see you , yolaine .
see you , franois .
franois had a lot to tell you .
i asked about his love life .
that must have been something .
he's going for the 'adventure 'why not?
he's not going further .
he pays .
he is scared and runs away .
he's scared of a real relationship .
and you?
do you sometimes sleep with a prostitute?
why d'you ask that?
you can say if you like .
no , thats nothing for me .
why?
i find it disgusting .
have you had a good day?
um , no .
i had an important appointment and it was terrible .
i didn't like the others thoughts so was screwing around .
as a result : it ended .
gryner was perplexed .
and you?
i was finished early .
i went to buy shoes .
quite expensive .
are you still reading?
no .
mum?
aren't you sleeping?
of course not .
then maybe you should get up .
getting up or not , what difference does it make?
no , please .
its midday and the sun is shining .
you can ask nora to clean up .
absolutely not .
she steals stuff .
what?
towels , cutlery ...
but i have to keep quiet .
you should fire here since you're paying her .
how evil that person is .
disgraceful . !
your husband called me .
very charming .
we asked ourselves why we never saw each other .
you never want to leave the house .
or you obstruct it .
he's busy , he's often travelling .
he's quite funny though .
he got me laughing after two sentences .
you're lucky .
such a cute guy .
yea , he can definitely show himself .
you never talk about it .
maybe you find it normal , but ...
he's been cheating on me for years .
yea , that sucks .
but its not unusual .
is it tasty?
yes very nice .
hello .
d'you want to drink something?
coke .
a coke please .
everything alright?
yes .
we saw each other again .
he was sitting in the same place .
with his coffee and newspapers .
he had to go off to work and gave me a date before lunch .
he paid for a drink .
but it was very busy .
so he suggested a different place .
we went to a hotel .
the bar of a hotel?
no , to a room .
how so , to a room?
yes , it happened automatically .
he got what he wanted .
you went to bed with him?
yes .
thats not it !
thats not what i asked for !
what then?
i didn't ask you to get down on him .
he came down on me , as if he hadn't fucked in 10 years .
you understood me wrongly .
it was decided .
you're a normal average girl , nathalie .
after how much time does your nathalie go to bed?
i don't know what you want .
sorry .
i made a mistake .
hurry up , we'll be too late .
is there something?
go without me , i don't feel too well .
don't do that to me now .
i thik i'm getting a flu .
are you angry?
why would i be?
people say these things ... which they don't want to say .
d'you want an aspiririne?
i already took one .
i'll be back early .
good night .
d'you want to drink something?
a whiskey please .
i have to go now , but i'll be back .
what d'you want?
sorry about this morning .
its ok .
you didn't say it .
what?
the hotel , the room , how it went .
sorry , i don't have time .
i paid you .
come .
we'll change clothes here .
lets think ...
it was a nice room .
with red colours ..
at first there was no hesitation ... maybe because it went so fast .
we took something from the minibar .
i said nothing .
he neither .
but i saw from his look that he really wanted me .
he looked at my breasts .
i stretched a little .
he understood that i wanted him to have his way with me .
i unbuttoned my blouse and styled my hair as if i didn't know my blouse would fall open .
he came to me .
i felt his breathing .
i think he was already very excited .
then he grabbed me by the neck and asked me to lie down on the bed naked with my eyes closed .
he turned off the lights , except in the bathroom .
then he took off his clothes .
i didn't see him , but i felt his eyes cast on me .
he lay down on me .
i felt his mouth in my neck , his tongue on my breasts .
and then here .
shall i continue?
he wanted to take my immediately , but i found that too fast .
i stood up and took another glass .
i was thirsty .
he came behind me .
he stood against my back .
i started to move my thighs .
he took his cock in his hand and touched me all over .
he asked if i liked it .
he wanted to hear me say it .
then i gave him a condom and he came inside me .
he barely moved , as if he was scared to cum too soon .
suddently he pulled himself out and took me to the bed .
there i slowly jerked him off , carefully .
i didn't want him to cum immediately .
then i went on top .
i thrust my head backwards .
often men don't want to be stared at .
they concentrate on what excites them .
how long did it last?
i don't remember .
quite long .
when he came to orgasm , he supressed his scream .
i think he enjoyed it .
and you?
how did you feel?
it did excite me some how that he didn't know you were behind all this .
but for the rest nothing .
when i'm with a customer , i don't feel anything .
did he notice it?
i pretend .
thats my job .
now i must leave .
hi alice .
hi madam .
everything alright?
yes thank you .
hi madam .
come along .
was it here the first time also?
with me its not alright , and with you ...
he was too late .
he hadn't had lunch .
did he order that?
he doesn't like vouvray .
i do .
d'you want some?
its my glass .
thank you .
tasty no?
did it happen before?
before and after .
sit down .
this time he undressed me .
but not completely .
i cam from the other side of the room slowly moving towards him whilst i gave him a tight look .
i stroked my nipples
he came closer .
then he started licking them and bit them softly .
he then placed his fingers in my mouth .
he has nice hands , and a nice skin .
you think so?
yes .
its a soft skin .
i took his hand and brought it between my thighs .
he went inside my underwear and pushed his fingers inside .
it was quite brutal , but expert like .
i closed my legs .
he liked me giving resistance .
he penetrated me .
it lasted a long time .
and then he came to orgasm .
this time without supressing a scream .
he didn't want me to leave .
didn't he go back to the office?
not immediately .
he was tired and fell asleep .
i waited til he breathed normally again .
i had a cream in my handbag .
i put some in the palm of his hands .
this smell .
i stroked his cock with it .
i put some on my stomach .
when i felt he was about to cum , i grabbed him and fucked him .
then i kissed him , quickly .
i thought he'd like it .
after that we smoked a cigarette .
he gently took my hand .
i still had appointments and wanted to get up .
i don't want you to leave .
a girl like nathalie would have stayed right?
is that how you see nathalie?
about like that , yes .
watch out .
he lies like anything .
he isn't allowed to dump you immediately .
i don't expect that .
living in a hotel must be nice .
was he talking about me?
he said he had a woman whom he loved deeply .
yes , apparently he really loves me .
have you been doing this for long?
i don't keep count .
at what time do you start?
at seven .
how many days a week?
normally four .
more is possible too , if i want .
you smell good .
what fragrance is that?
d'you like it?
i bought it today .
no , i'm exhausted .
she's there .
shall we go?
see you later .
everything alright?
yes , with you?
bitch !
talking about bitches , d'you know what i had to do?
a woman wanted the exact same spots as you .
the previous week she came too .
make up marilyn monroe .
for the lips she wanted help from me .
did you see him?
<i>yes , but i was on the point of not going . </ i>
how come?
<i>i had a problem .
women's things . </ i>
<i>but he still wanted to go to the hotel . </ i>
he wanted me to undress , but i refused to .
he could touch me under my clothes i said .
<i>but he wanted to cum together or not . </ i>
<i>he asked questions about my life . </ i>
<i>i just made up some stuff . </ i>
<i>he also told a lot about himself . </ i>
<i>and abou you . </ i>
he had the feeling that at present you were somewhere far away .
i asked myself if he knew about it , if he was violent .
<i>how he would react . </ i>
<i>hello? </ i>
i'm still here .
<i>am i bothering?
are you free tonight? </ i>
no .
not tonight .
<i>pity .
i'm not working . </ i>
come eat something .
come catherine .
til later .
i'll call you .
who was it?
your mother?
big secret .
everything ok?
eat , it'll get cold .
now that we're with the three of us .
how was he?
calm?
yes .
he saw people he knew and waved to them .
what kind of people?
a couple .
was it a young woman?
and old one?
like you .
he found it annoying that they saw him .
i was wearing this skirt .
my shoulderband was constantly sliding off .
one time he did it good again and stroked my shoulder .
i took his hand under the table and slid it through my thighs upwards .
i wasn't wearing any underwear .
he noticed .
he hesitated , but didn't do anything .
and suddenly he got what he wanted .
i told him i was going to the bathroom ... and that he should join me over there .
i waited a few minutes in the ladies room with the door ajar .
i wasn't sure if he'd come .
just when i wanted to go back upstairs he came .
we went inside the cabin .
he pushed me against the wall and kissed me bitingly in the neck .
he opened up my legs .
then a woman wanted to come inside but he blocked the door shut .
we were thrown out of the restaurant as if we were thieves .
it was all for nothing .
no .
we walked through the street .
he constantly looked at me , as if he still wanted to ask me something but wasn't sure how to put it .
i felt he was still excited .
we walked through a carriage gate
there was a patio behind that ... with a some small stairs .
i went to sit over there .
he stayed on his feet .
motionless , without touching me .
i took my dress off .
i was stark naked .
we didn't care about people passing by .
i went up the stairs .
he came after me .
we heard voices coming out of the rooms .
on the last step i leant against the window .
there he took me .
he fucked me .
it was hefty .
and then ... something happened .
nathalie also cummed .
nathalie ... you?
with me it never happens whilst i work .
but you did enjoy .
that's your fault .
do you still love him?
i don't know .
please , madam .
thank you .
your mother called .
i'll call her back .
can you help a sec?
of course .
how old were you when you had your first period .
fourteen .
and your job?
dancer .
classical ballet .
d'you use preservatives?
no .
d'you want a child?
absolutely not .
don't you take any precautions whilst having sex then?
i've never done it before .
i'm listening .
i tried it once .
it was a disaster .
i couldn't .
it hurt so much i got into a panic .
i don't know if i am like everybody .
see you miss .
thank you .
hi alice .
see you tomorrow .
hi madam .
what are you doing here?
i saw your sign .
i hesitated but decided to come .
was that wrong
no .
i'll get changed .
do you also get girls like me?
sometimes .
i couldn't , we know each other .
i shouldn't have come .
this is my job .
did you see him again?
yes .
we can talk about it later .
we're here now already .
i don't want to speak about it here .
start already .
ok .
what happened today?
oh yes , i had to sit on my hands and feet .
he pulled my thighs apart .
with lack of some type of lube he spat .
i want your ass , i'm going to take you .
i let him his way ...
you can stop now .
are you shocked?
you wanted all the details .
is that how he really talks?
vulgar words like that are nothing to him .
not my fault .
and you gabble it off like that ...
its slutty in ...
slutty?
yes , and then?
you have no idea what they all saw .
he is not a customer like any other .
you are no customer as any other .
it can't work every time .
what d'you mean?
i can't help that i get excited .
i know thats how you make your living
but your tricks to excite men will surely not work with everybody .
you could better leave .
go look for somebody else .
as you see i'm back in real estate , my first profession ,
ok , its still quite empty , but the potential is enormous .
i didn't invite you for no reason .
i'm in search of resources .
you saw , and now the appraisal comes , that the area is flourishing .
its blooming amazingly .
my wife .
good evening .
still in stasbourg?
yes , and very glad .
call me sometime marianne !
see you .
a great woman .
she worked with us for six months .
no .
actually not .
good night .
this place is nice , althoguh i don't know what he wants with it .
we'll make it .
its already succeeded .
you know i have to leave .
a flight .
it did give me pleasure though .
thank you .
here .
no , not now .
yes , like that i don't owe you .
okey then .
see you tomorrow , hon .
see you , franois .
and congratulations .

i went to the bar .
d'you want to do this job as ...
yes , why not .
i find it quite fun i have a diploma .
i have to think about the future .
so you'll stop with it some time?
of course .
it is certainly not my call in this world .
but we've not reached that point in time yet .
i received your message .
what did you want to say?
that i went to bed with a man .
quite a cute man .
and quite rough too .
did he also pay?
i let it go .
i was drunk .
that helps .
i thought about something again .
we can't leave it as it is .
oh no?
i thought we were done .
i don't .
i saw him again .
did he call you?
no , i did .
i was in the mood .
i thought i wasn't going to see you again .
we had talked .
i had a dreadful day .
i was just put out of my flat .
he was very sweet , he listened .
that gave pleasure .
he acted as if your problems hurt him .
no , not acted .
and where are you sleeping now?
he offered to hire something for me .
but you refused .
i told him i'd think about it .
i'd find it awkward against you .
you see this flat is sub divided .
this is the southern side .
the kitchen is fully furnished and there's a lot of storage space .
is it for two?
no .
excuse me ...
hello?
one moment ...
take your time looking around , i'll wait outside .
its really a bad time , i'm with customers .
do you like it?
yes .
but you don't have to pay .
yes i will , it will help you .

<i>he came and lay down on me . </ i>
<i>he wanted to cum on my face . </ i>
<i>i asked myself whether you'd want that . </ i>
<i>l hesitated . </ i>
<i>and then i said yes .
but shyly . </ i>
<i>as if it was the first time . </ i>
<i>he came and stood above me . </ i>
<i>and jerked himself off . </ i>
<i>i got it all over my face . </ i>
<i>it was warm . </ i>
<i>and then he left again . </ i>
<i>i stayed alone, </ i> <i>naked in the room . </ i>
<i>i must have slept for a while . </ i>
<i>i drank something , i was thirsty . </ i>
<i>i wanted to call you , but ... </ i>
<i>i stood up , the window was open . </ i>

friends ... but not bernard .
no , not him .
i thought you wouldn't like that .
i also prefer you do it elsewhere with the others .
ok .
he's quite calm with me .
i don't know whats going on inside him .
he went crazy in the flat .
he thought i had somebody else .
i couldn't really say it was you .
poor devil .
he was jealous .
i actually like that though .
did you feel flattered?
not only that .
with men jealousy is a reflex .
and after that everything was alright again?
yes .
he undressed you ...
he was excited , you gave him a blowjob , he fucked you .
no , he couldn't .
i saw him suffering and didn't insist .
but it did touch me somehow .
how so , touched you?
he felt he was using me and didn't want that .
because he respects you in such a way ...
i think he's serious .
no .
he wants to live together with me .
he couldn't have possibly said that?
why?
if he knows who you are ...
tell him , then we'll see .
naked in a hotel room its possible , but in his world ...
what's special about it , except that no more fucking happens?
i couldn't care less about him anymore .
thats not true , otherwise you would have left him .
i'll see you later .
come , there's a table over there .
a glass of champagne?
hi , djamel .
two champagne .
hi , joke .

i didn't see him .
but you looked with such a gaze .

i know exactly where we are .
i thought you were quite rude to him .

strange no?
are you alright?
yes .
he had a strange smell .
a smell of daffodils .
daffodils are really yellow right?

he wants to leave me .
you were right .
he does want to leave me .
did he say that?
no .
not with so many words .
but i feel it .
he really keeps his distance .
and acts cool .
he heardly says anthing .
he doesn't even lie about what he does in his time .
maybe you're mistaken .
i don't think so , no .

a whiskey please .
i still don't know what you want to tell me .
you'd be angry if i did .
no .
no , i can understand .
maybe i broke something .
are you listening .
yes .
if you had another man , you would have told me .
but everytime i say something ... or do something ... it doesn't seem to get through .
you're angry with me .
it can't end like this can it?
why not?
because i love you .

no idea .
i'm going to move house .
i was waiting til you came .
you're husband didn't look at me , he only gave me a fire .
he didn't see me , you have a different taste .
i stole from you .
yes , you lied to me .
stolem
why?
it was a chance like i never got one .
not having to do it .
and you wanted it so much .
i just made up everything .
if i would have said it , we wouldn't have seen each other again .
this is a cheap joke .
now you won't believe me anymore .
we're coming late .
i'm hurrying .
and what if we didn't go?
