good luck , swish !
no talking .
julius , go up there and see what that man is doing .
why don't you leave that man alone?
i'm just trying to lay down for a few minutes before i go back to work .
look , if i'm not getting any sleep , you're not getting any sleep .
<i>now , that was mean . </ i>
<i>taking sleep from my father</ i> <i>was like taking ignorance</ i> <i>from a rapper . </ i>
yeah?
it's julius .
hey , mr. julius , how you doing?

uh huh?
i got on the basketball team , and i need to learn how to play by tomorrow .
the basketball team?
man , are you crazy?
you know you don't know how to play .
didn't i say that?
i just need to know enough to look like i know something .
you know how to faint?
you mean , like , fake somebody out?
no , i mean , like , fall down on the ground so you won't have to play .
okay , thank you so much for calling , ms. martella .
i really appreciate it .
all right , then .
bye bye .
chris !
how come you didn't tell me you failed a quiz?
you failed a quiz?
oh , no , no , it gets better than that .
since he failed that quiz , he can't play in a basketball game tomorrow .
<i>thank the lord ! </ i>
you're on the basketball team?
you can't play basketball .
i tried to tell him that ...
great !
<i>it always killed my father</ i> <i>that i was no good at sports . </ i>
<i>but he would never</ i> <i>tell me that . </ i>
my man !
it always killed me that you were no good at sports .
i'm sorry i flunked off the team , dad .
you're not off the team yet .
what?
lucky for you , your coach got you a make up quiz .
<i>damn ! </ i>
that's what i'm talking about .
so , after dinner , go upstairs and study .
because if you don't pass that quiz ,
i'm going to score 40 on your behind .
* everybody hates chris . *
hey .
oh , hi , swish .
good luck with the game .
hey , hey , wait .
i wasn't trying to blow you off the other day .
then why did you?
it was just that ...
it's just i'm not cool?
<i>i liked hanging out</ i> <i>with greg, </ i> <i>but a life without daily</ i> <i>ass whuppings</ i> <i>does have its appeal . </ i>
no , it's not like that .
it's just ... it's kind of good to get a break .
all right .
i mean , i can't blame you .
if i were you i'd probably do the same thing .
hey , i think i aced the quiz .
i know i failed it .
wait , but doesn't that mean you can't play ball?
i wish .
coach brady found out and he got me a make up .
my mom made me study all night .
and if i don't pass , she will kill me .
but if you do play everybody's going to hate you .
not everybody .
just everybody on the team ... everybody who likes the team and everybody else .
all done .
<i>i decided to fail</ i> <i>the test on purpose . </ i>
<i>whatever my mother</ i> <i>might do to me, </ i> <i>at least it wasn't 400 of her . </ i>
you passed .
what? !
hold on , let me see this .
every answer on this paper is wrong .
you are on the basketball team , right?
yeah , but what does that have to do with anything?
good luck at the game , swish .
<i>another life secret </ i> <i>black man plus basketball</ i> <i>equals a c plus . </ i>
i passed .
way to go , baby !
way to go !
swish , swish , swish ...
<i>i bet this is how</ i> <i>milli vanilli must have felt</ i> <i>when they were walking up</ i> <i>to accept their grammy . </ i>
miss rochelle?
i didn't mean to bother you , but can i borrow some scotch tape and some ten pound test fishing line?
fishing line?
ten pound test .
we don't have any fishing line , mr. tate .
maybe your husband does .
well , maybe i'll ask him when he gets home .
thank you , ma'am .
i'll come back down .
that man is not from philly .
swish .
i want to run you through a couple plays .
basically , here's you with the ball , and here's the rest of the guys getting out of your way .
you got it?
yeah , i got it .
great .
i'll see you out there .
* sweet dreams are made of this *
* who am i to disagre? *

<i>you hear those people? </ i>
<i>they believe in me . </ i>

i thought you said you were from harlem .
sorry about the game , man .
you should have fainted like i told you .
who's that white girl who kept screaming at you?
nobody .
i'm sorry , baby .
<i>at that time i didn't know what</ i> <i>i was going to be</ i> <i>when i grew up, </ i> <i>but i knew i wasn't going</ i> <i>to be a basketball player . </ i>
well , it's okay .
at least i passed my social studies quiz .
what's that?
nothing .
anybody want some kool aid?
julius , i thought something was wrong the minute i laid eyes on that man , and now i know it .

you're kicking me out?
i'm sorry .
it's ... it's not going to work out .
i gave you six months rent .
i know .

<i>turns out my mother was right . </ i>
<i>mr .
tate wasn't from philly . </ i>
<i>he was wanted in so many states</ i> <i>for so many crimes</ i> <i>that when they caught him</ i> <i>they had to let 30 guys go . </ i>
what's that?
nothing .
that's just mr. tate leaving .
hmm .
wait a minute .
where's my kool aid?
nice game , raj .
the one chance you have to make yourself useful and you blew it .
i'd punch you if you didn't stink so bad .
hey ...
go for the yellow .
the yellow?
yeah .
hey , how come you didn't come to the game?
i felt bad not being there , but i would have felt worse seeing you miss all those shots , trip over the ball and pass to the other team .
you sure you weren't there?
<i>the good thing about</ i> <i>hanging out with nerds was</ i> <i>they were happy</ i> <i>to hang out with anybody . </ i>
