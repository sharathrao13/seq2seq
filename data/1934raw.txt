a chandelier in pieces .
some of you may recall the strange affair of the phantom of the opera .
a mystery never fully explained .
we're told , ladies and gentlemen , that this is the very chandelier ... ... which figures in the famous disaster .
our workshops have repaired it and wired parts of it for the new electric light .
perhaps we can frighten away the ghost of so many years ago ... ... with a little illumination .
gentlemen?
the trophy from our saviors
from our saviors
from the enslaving force ... ... of rome !
madame .
with feasting and dancing and song
tonight in celebration we greet the victorious throng
returned to bring salvation !
i've got them , monsieur .
vicomte , welcome .
the trumpets of carthage resound
hear , romans , now and tremble
hark to our step on the ground
hear the drums hannibal comes !
you make my dress train too long .
sad to return to find the land we love
threatened once more by roma's far reaching grasp
gentlemen , gentlemen ...
rehearsals are under way for a new production of chalumeau's hannibal .
monsieur lefevre , i am rehearsing .
monsieur reyer , madame giry ... ... ladies and gentlemen , please , if i could have your attention?
as you know , there have been rumors of my imminent retirement .
i can now tell you that these were all true , and it is my pleasure to introduce you ... ... to the two gentlemen who now own the opera populaire ... ... monsieur richard firmin and monsieur gilles andre .
i'm sure you have read of their recent fortune in the junk business .
scrap metal , actually .
they must be rich .
and we are deeply honored to introduce our new patron .
the vicomte de chagny .
i still can't believe we managed to get him .
it's such a coup for us , my dear .
it's raoul .
before my father died , at the house by the sea ... ... i guess you could say we were childhood sweethearts .
he called me little lotte .
christine , he's so handsome .
my parents and i are honored to support all the arts ... ... especially the world renowned opera populaire .
gentlemen , signora carlotta giudicelli , our leading soprano for five seasons .
brava !
brava !
brava !
brava !
signor ubaldo piangi .
an honor , signor .
i believe i'm keeping you from your rehearsal .
i will be here this evening to share your great triumph .
my apologies .
thank you , monsieur .
once more if you please , signor .
he love me .
he love me .
thank you , indeed , for the wonderful words .
so inspiring and encouraging ...
he wouldn't recognize me .
he didn't see you .
if you please .
monsieur .
we take particular pride in the excellence of our ballet .
i see why .
especially that little blond angel .
my daughter , meg giry .
and that exceptional beauty .
no relation , i trust?
christine daae .
promising talent , monsieur firmin .
very promising .
daae , did you say?
no relation to the famous swedish violinist?
his only child .
orphaned at 7 when she came to live and train in the ballet dormitories .
an orphan , you say?
i think of her as a daughter also .
gentlemen , if you would kindly stand to one side .
hannibal's friends !
ah , me !
not on my dress !
why?
the trumpeting elephants sound
hear , romans , now and tremble
hark to their step on the ground
hear the drums !
hannibal comes !
all day !
all they want is the dancing !
well , the vicomte is very excited about tonight's gala .
i hope he is as excited by dancing girls as your new managers ... ... because i will not be singing !
get my doggy , bring my doggy .
bye bye .
what do we do?
grovel .
grovel , grovel .
right .
i'm going now .
it is finished .
world renowned artist and great beauty .
bella diva .
goddess of song .
monsieur reyer , isn't there a rather marvelous aria for elissa ... ... in act 3 of hannibal?
perhaps the signora ...
because i have not my costume for act 3 .
because somebody not finish it !
and i hate my hat !
signora , as a personal favor , would you oblige us with a private rendition?
unless , of course , monsieur reyer objects .
if my managers command .
monsieur reyer?
if my diva commands .
yes , i do .
everybody , very quiet .
monsieur , why exactly are you retiring?
my health .
i see .
you as well !
signora .
maestro .
think of me think of me fondly
when we've said goodbye
remember me once in a while
please promise me you'll try
when you find that once again you long to take your heart back
and be free ...
oh , my god , signora !
i hate you .
lift it up !
he's here .
the phantom of the opera .
signora , are you all right?
buquet !
for god's sake , what's going on up there?
please , monsieur , don't look at me .
as god's my judge , i wasn't at my post .
please , monsieur , there's no one there .
or if there is , well , then , it must be a ghost .
signora , these things do happen .
for the past three years these things do happen .
and did you stop them from happening?
no !
and you two , you are as bad as him .
these things do happen .
until you stop these things from happening , this thing does not happen !
bring my doggy and my boxy .
amateurs .
now you see .
bye bye , i'm really leaving .
gentlemen , good luck .
if you need me , i shall be in australia .
signora giudicelli , she will be coming back , won't she?
you think so , monsieur?
i have a message from the opera ghost .
oh , god in heaven , you're all obsessed !
he welcomes you to his opera house .
his opera house?
and commands that you continue to leave box five empty ... ... for his use .
and reminds you that his salary is due .
his salary?
well , monsieur lefevre used to give him 20, 000 francs a month .
twenty thousand francs?
perhaps you can afford more .
with the vicomte as your patron?
madame , i had hoped to make that announcement public tonight ... ... when the vicomte was to join us for the gala .
obviously , we shall now have to cancel , as it appears we have lost our star !
but surely there must be an understudy .
there is no understudy for la carlotta !
a full house , andre .
we shall have to refund a full house !
christine daae could sing it , sir .
what , a chorus girl?
don't be silly .
she has been taking lessons from a great teacher .
who?
i don't know his name , monsieur .
let her sing for you , monsieur .
she has been well taught .
all right .
come on , don't be shy .
come on , come along .
just ...
from the beginning of the aria then , please , mademoiselle .
andre , this is doing nothing for my nerves .
she's very pretty .
think of me think of me fondly
when we've said goodbye
remember me once in a while
please promise me you'll try
when you find that once again you long ... ... to take your heart back and be free
if you ever find a moment
spare a thought for me
we never said our love was evergreen or as unchanging as the sea
but if you can still remember
stop and think of me
think of all the things we've shared and seen
don't think about the way
things might have been
think of me , think of me waking
silent and resigned
imagine me , trying too hard ... ... to put you from my mind
recall those days look back on all those times
think of the things we'll never do
there will never be a day
when i won't think of you
can it be?
can it be christine?
bravo !
long ago it seems so long ago
how young and innocent we were
she may not remember me
but i remember her
flowers fade the fruits of summer fade
they have their seasons so do we
but please promise me that sometimes
you will think ...
... of me
brava !
brava !
brava , brava , bravissima
christine , christine
christine
where in the world have you been hiding?
really , you were perfect
i only wish i knew your secret
who is your great tutor?
meg ... ... when your mother brought me here to live ... ... whenever i'd come down here alone ... ... to light a candle for my father ... ... a voice , from above ... ... and in my dreams , he was always there .
you see ... ... when my father lay dying ... ... he told me i would be protected by an angel .
an angel of music .
christine , do you believe?
do you think the spirit of your father's coaching you?
who else , meg?
who?
father once spoke of an angel
i used to dream he'd appear
now as i sing i can sense him
and i know he's here
here in this room he calls me softly
somewhere inside hiding
somehow i know he's always with me
he , the unseen genius
christine , you must have been dreaming ... ... stories like this can't come true
christine , you're talking in riddles
and it's not like you
angel of music guide and guardian
grant to me your glory who is this angel?
this angel of music , hide no longer this angel of music , hide no longer
secret and strange angel secret and strange angel
he's with me even now
your hands are cold all around me
your face , christine , it's white
it frightens me don't be frightened
no .
no .
you did very well , my dear .
he is pleased with you .
vicomte .
vicomte .
we've made quiet a discovery with miss daae .
perhaps we could present her to you , dear vicomte?
if you wouldn't mind , this is one visit i should prefer to make unaccompanied .
thank you .
it would appear they've met before .
little lotte let her mind wander .
little lotte thought , " am i fonder of dolls or of goblins or shoes?
raoul .
" or of riddles or frocks?
those picnics in the attic .
" or of chocolates?
father playing the violin .
as we read to each other ... ... dark stories of the north .
no .
what i love best , " lotte said , " is when i'm asleep in my bed .
and the angel of music sings songs in my head
the angel of music sings songs in my head
you sang like an angel tonight .
when i'm in heaven , child , i will send the angel of music to you .
well , father is dead , raoul .
and i have been visited by the angel of music .
no doubt of it .
and now we go to supper .
no , raoul .
the angel of music is very strict .
well , i shan't keep you up late .
raoul , no .
you must change .
i'll order my carriage , little lotte .
no .
raoul , wait !
insolent boy , this slave of fashion
basking in your glory
ignorant fool , this brave young suitor
sharing in my triumph
angel , i hear you speak , i listen
stay by my side guide me
angel , my soul was weak forgive me
enter at last , master
flattering child , you shall know me
see why in shadow i hide
look at your face in the mirror
i am there inside !
angel of music , guide and guardian
grant to me your glory
angel of music , hide no longer
come to me , strange angel
i am your angel of music
come to me , angel of music
whose is that voice?
who is that in there?
i am your angel of music christine .
christine !
come to me , angel of music
in sleep he sang to me
in dreams he came
that voice which calls to me
and speaks my name
and do i dream again?
for now i find ...
the phantom of the opera is there ... ... inside my mind
sing once again with me
our strange duet
my power over you ... ... grows stronger yet
and though you turn from me ... ... to glance behind
the phantom of the opera is there ... ... inside your mind
those who have seen your face ... ... draw back in fear
i am the mask you wear
it's me they hear
your spirit and my voice my spirit and your voice
in one combined in one combined
the phantom of the opera is there the phantom of the opera is there
inside my mind inside your mind
he's there , the phantom of the opera
sing , my angel of music .
sing , my angel .
sing for me !
sing , my angel .
sing for me !
i have brought you
to the seat of sweet music's throne
to this kingdom where all must pay homage to music
music , you have come here
for one purpose , and one alone
since the moment i first heard you sing
i have needed you with me to serve me , to sing
for my music
my music
nighttime sharpens ... ... heightens each sensation
darkness stirs ... ... and wakes imagination
silently the senses ... ... abandon their defenses
slowly , gently
night unfurls its splendor
grasp it , sense it
tremulous and tender
turn your face away
from the garish light of day
turn your thoughts away
from cold , unfeeling light
and listen to the music of the night
close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
close your eyes
let your spirit start ... ... to soar
and you'll live as you've never lived before
softly , deftly
music shall caress you
hear it , feel it
secretly possess you
open up your mind
let your fantasies unwind
in this darkness that you know ... ... you cannot fight
the darkness of the music of the night
let your mind start a journey through a strange new world
leave all thoughts of the life you knew before
let your soul take you
where you long to be
only then can you belong ... ... to me
floating , falling
sweet intoxication
touch me , trust me
savor each sensation
let the dream begin
let your darker side give in ... ... to the power of the music that i write
the power of the music of the night
you alone can make my song take flight
help me make ...
the music of the ...
... night
christine?
like yellow parchment is his skin
a great black hole serves as the nose that never grew
you must be always on your guard
or he will catch you with his magical lasso
oh , my .
those who speak of what they know
find too late that prudent silence is wise
joseph buquet , hold your tongue
keep your hand at the level of your eyes .
i remember there was mist
swirling mist upon a vast , glassy lake
there were candles all around
and on the lake there was a boat
and in the boat there was a man
who was that shape in the shadows?
whose is the face in the mask?
damn you !
you little prying pandora
you little demon !
is this what you wanted to see?
curse you !
you little lying delilah
you little viper now you cannot ever be free
damn you !
curse you !
stranger than you dreamt it
can you even dare to look ... ... or bear to think of me?
this loathsome gargoyle who burns in hell
but secretly yearns for heaven ... ... secretly , secretly
christine
fear can turn to love
you'll learn to see to find the man
behind the monster , this
repulsive carcass who seems a beast
but secretly dreams of beauty ... secretly , secretly
oh , christine
come , we must return .
those two fools who run my theater will be missing you .
mystery after gala night
it says " mystery of soprano's flight
mystified " all the papers say
we are mystified we suspect foul play
bad news on soprano scene first carlotta , now christine ... ... still at least the seats get sold
gossip's worth its weight in gold
what a way to run a business
spare me these unending trials
half your cast disappears but the crowd still cheers
opera !
to hell with gluck and handel have a scandal
and you're sure to have a hit damnable , will they all walk out?
this is damnable andre , please don't shout
it's publicity , and the take is vast free publicity
but we have no cast
andre , have you seen the queue?
it seems you've got one too
dear andre , what a charming gala christine was , in a word , sublime
we were hardly bereft when carlotta left
on that note , the diva's a disaster
must you cast her when she's seasons past her prime?
dear firmin , just a brief reminder
my salary has not been paid
send it care of the ghost by return of post pto
no one likes a debtor so it's better if my orders are obeyed
who would have the gall to send this?
someone with a puerile brain these are both signed o. g.
who the hell is he?
opera ghost
it's nothing short of shocking he is mocking our position
in addition he wants money what a funny apparition
to expect a large retainer he is clearly quite insane
where is she?
carlotta?
i mean , miss daae where is she?
how do we know?
i want an answer
you sent me this note what's this nonsense?
of course not don't look at us
she's not with you?
of course not
we're in the dark don't argue , isn't this the letter you wrote?
and what is it that we're meant to have wrote?
written .
do not fear for miss daae .
the angel of music has her under his wing .
make no attempt to see her again .
if you didn't write it , who did?
where is he?
welcome back your precious patron , where is he?
what is it?
i have your letter
a letter i rather resent did you send it?
of course not as if he would
you didn't send it?
of course not
what's going on?
tell me , this is not the letter you sent?
and what is it that i'm meant to have sent?
your days at the opera populaire are numbered .
christine daae will be singing on your behalf tonight .
be prepared for a great misfortune ... ... should you attempt to take her place .
far too many notes for my taste
and most of them about christine
all we've heard since we came is miss daae's name
miss daae has returned i hope no worse for wear
as far as we're concerned where precisely is she now?
i thought it best she was alone
she needed rest
may i see her?
no , monsieur , she will see no one
will she sing?
will she sing?
here , i have a note let me see it
please .
gentlemen , i have now sent you several notes of the most amiable nature ... ... detailing how my theater is to be run .
you have not followed my instructions .
i shall give you one last chance .
christine daae has returned to you
and i am anxious her career should progress ... ... in the new production of ii muto
you will therefore cast carlotta ... ... as the pageboy
and put miss daae in the role of countess
the role which miss daae plays ... ... calls for charm and appeal
the role of the pageboy is silent which makes my casting in a word , ideal
i shall watch the performance from my normal seat in box five ... ... which will be kept empty for me .
should these commands be ignored ... ... a disaster beyond your imagination will occur .
i remain , gentlemen , your obedient servant .
o. g.
christine whatever next?
it's all a ploy to help christine this is insane
i know who sent this the vicomte , her lover
indeed !
can you believe this?
signora
signora you are our star
and always will be signora
the man is mad we don't take orders
miss daae will be playing the pageboy , the silent role .
carlotta will be playing the lead
it's useless trying to appease me appease her
you're only saying this to please me to please her
who scorn his word , beware to those you have reviled me
the angel sees , the angel knows you have rebuked me
signora , pardon us you have replaced me
please , signora , we beseech you
i must see her this hour shall see your darkest fears
the angel knows , the angel hears where did she go?
signora , sing for us don't be a martyr
what new surprises lie in store?
our star !
would you please give this to miss daae?
miss daae?
your public needs you .
we need you too .
would you not rather have your precious little ingnue?
signora , no .
signora , no .
the world wants you
prima donna first lady of the stage
your devotees are on their knees
to implore you
can you bow out when they're shouting your name?
think of how they all adore you
prima donna enchant us once again
think of your muse and of the queues round the theater
can you deny us the triumph in store?
sing , prima donna once more
christine spoke of an angel prima donna
your song shall live again
think of your public you took a snub
but there's a public who needs you she has heard the voice
of the angel of music those who hear your voice
liken you to an angel think of their cry of undying support
we get our opera she gets her limelight
follow where the limelight leads you leading ladies are a trial
prima donna your song shall never die
you'll sing again and to unending ovation orders , warnings
lunatic demands lunatic demands are regular occurrences
think how you'll shine in that final encore
surely there'll be further scenes worse than this
i must see these demands are rejected
who'd believe a diva happy to relieve a chorus girl
who's gone and slept with the patron?
raoul and the soubrette entwined in love's duet
although he may demur he must have been with her
you'd never get away with all this in a play
but if it's loudly sung and in a foreign tongue
it's just the sort of story audiences adore
in fact , a perfect opera for if his curse is on the opera
prima donna , the world is at your feet
a nation waits and how it hates to be cheated
light up the stage ... ... with that age old rapport
sing , prima donna
once more
go on , go , go .
they say that this youth has set my lady's heart aflame
his lordship , sure would die of shock
his lordship is a laughingstock
should he suspect her , god protect her shame , shame , shame
this faithless lady's bound for hades
shame , shame , shame
serafimo , your disguise is perfect
why , who can this be?
gentle wife admit your loving husband
that's exactly the sort of thing the public loves .
my love , i'm called to england on affairs of state
and must leave you with your new maid
though i would happily take the maid with me .
the old fool is leaving .
it's the countess de charbourg .
she's invited us to her salon , you know .
nothing like that ever happened in the junk business .
scrap metal .
serafimo , away with this pretense
you cannot speak but kiss me in my husband's absence
poor fool , he makes me laugh
time i tried to get a better better half
poor fool , he doesn't know
if he knew the truth he'd never ever go
did i not instruct that box five was to be kept empty?
he's here , the phantom of the opera .
it's him .
your part is silent , little toad .
a toad , madame?
perhaps it is you who are the toad .
why you spray on my chin all the time , huh?
serafimo , away with this pretense
you cannot speak but kiss me in my ...
gentlemen , please , please .
poor fool , he makes me laugh
she's lost her voice .
mother !
bring the curtain in , please , will you?
get off .
ladies and gentlemen , we apologize .
the performance will continue in 10 minutes 'time ... ... when the role of the countess will be played by miss daae .
thank you .
go , go , hurry up .
hurry up .
until then , we would crave your indulgence for a few moments .
meanwhile , we'd like to give you the ballet from act 3 of tonight's opera .
what?
maestro ... ... the ballet , bring it forward , please .
the ballet .
the ballet , now , please .
thank you .
you're fired .
are you all right?
raoul , we're not safe here .
ladies and gentlemen , please remain in your seats .
do not panic .
it's simply an accident .
an accident .
why have you brought me here?
we can't go back there we must return
he'll kill you his eyes will find us there
christine , don't say that those eyes that burn
don't even think it if he has to kill a thousand men
forget this waking nightmare the phantom of the opera will kill
believe me there is no phantom of the opera
my god , who is this man who hunts to kill?
this mask of death i can't escape from him
whose is this voice you hear i never will
with every breath?
and in this labyrinth
where night is blind
the phantom of the opera is here the phantom of the opera is there
inside my mind inside your mind
there is no phantom of the opera
raoul , i've been there ... ... to his world of unending night
to a world where the daylight dissolves into darkness
darkness
raoul , i've seen him
can i ever forget that sight?
can i ever escape from that face?
so distorted , deformed it was hardly a face ... ... in that darkness
darkness
but his voice filled my spirit with a strange , sweet sound
in that night there was music in my mind
