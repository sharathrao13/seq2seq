i need to speak with the man in charge , fellas .
don't point that gun at him .
he's an unpaid intern .
vikram , what kind of coverage you gettin '?
i just kept it rolling till they put this hood over my head .
bill speaks their language .
what are they saying , billy?
hold on .
okay .
apparently they're taking a hostage .
obviously they've chosen ned ...
uh , now that they've found out that i speak filipino ... they seem to be changing their minds .
do you have a vault?
they want to know if there's a vault .
there's no vault .
our vault contains at least 10 different currencies ... from all over the world at any given moment ... and we are prepared for every kind of financial necessity .
there goes ned's inheritance .
tell them if they don't get off my boat right now ... there's gonna be a major shit storm .
ned o , can you hear me?
we'll get ya back , billy .
is everybody else safe?
anne marie , are you okay , honey?
no , i'm not .
i told you these were unprotected waters .
what a fuckin 'nightmare .
be cool on this shit , okay , cubbie?
i mean , at least try to show both sides .
i need to find a baby for this father .
yeah , i think i know what you mean .
steve .
here we go .
steve , what are you going ...
i said get your ass ... the hell off of my boat !
# i'm a street walking cheetah with a heart full of napalm #
# i'm a runaway son of the nuclear a bomb #
# i am a world's forgotten boy #
# the one who searches and destroys #
# honey , gotta help me , please #
# somebody gotta save my soul #
# baby , detonate for me ow #
# look out , honey 'cause i'm usin 'technology #
# ain't got time to make no apology #
i've never seen a bond company stooge stick his neck out like that .
what's that sound?
is that ...
the arctic night lights .
yeah .
as if the natural world's been turned upside down . " lord mandrake .
vikram , get some cutaways of this miracle .
klaus , ogata , put out the deck fires before we sink .
those fucking amateurs .
you left your dog , you idiots .
wrap this stiff in a tablecloth .
we're gonna bury him at sea .
shouldn't we give him to the authorities or something?
no .
i'll write up a few words to read over him .
how ya holdin 'up there , intern?
doin 'okay?
ned , how many fingers am i holdin 'up?
i don't know .
that's not my job .
too many to tell .
how many fingers ...
he's gonna be just fine .
i believe it's criminal that steve allowed this to happen to us ... by which i mean illegal .
we're being led on an illegal suicide mission by a selfish maniac .
i hear what you're saying , but i think you misjudge the guy .
saint paul said to the corinthians ...
without kin , no man may regard himself kindly .
without s ...
holy shit !
son of a bitch .
cut .
this is captain hennessey .
we've come in response to your distress signal .
remain calm until ...
good god .
is that you , steven?
ogata , run downstairs and put a tarp over anything that says " operation hennessey " on it .
what about this guy?
just throw him over the other side .
your engine blew up , and all your fuel's been stolen .
is that correct?
uh huh .
i certainly know how you feel .
some crooked fuckers just stripped my sea lab , you know .
probably the same dudes .
i can tow you as far as port au patois .
i'll need your signature on that invoice first .
it accounts for the expenses of the rescue operation as well as my time and that of my crew .
this is more than the budget of my whole project .
it's an estimate .
uh , what's your dog's name?
cody .
be still , cody .
i have to run this by my bond company stooge .
he's been kidnapped .
that's true .
i have to rescue him first .
well , sign it now , or i'm leavin 'you out here .
oh .
i dined with eleanor last weekend , by the way .
she's summering at my villa in west port au patois , don't you know .
say , how's team zissou holdin 'up without her?
what'd i do?
is it all my fault?
well , he's probably right .
most of us have been together a long time .
there are others that were here before that .
do you all not like me anymore?
i mean , what am i supposed to do?
i don't know .
look , if you're not against me ... don't cross this line .
if yes , do .
i love you all .
are you sure?
yes , i am .
i don't understand .
why?
what do you mean?
wait a second .
what are we doing?
you said cross the line if ...
cross the line if you're going to quit .
oh .
do it again .
i misunderstood .
hi , ross .
i got your corrections on the proofs .
they're fine , but ...
i'm not coming back .
it's over .
please don't try to contact me , okay?
you'll hear from us sometime .
we got attacked by pirates .
i feel as if life is ...
well , you get the idea .
anyway , take care of yourself .
jane .
will you write to me?
of course .
give me the address .
well , actually , i went ahead and stamped and self addressed ... 50 or so envelopes just to ... make it easier for you .
thanks .
i'll use them .
each one has three blank pages in it , and ... here's a pen .
maybe i'm going to write you a letter right now .
okay .
bet i'm gonna really miss you , ned .
i'm gonna miss you too .
in fact , i feel like ...
i don't know .
i feel like my heart's almost getting broken .
i guess i'm overreacting .
is that really true?
yes , it is .
that was all off the record , cubbie .
that whole deal .
actually , i'm surprised you didn't cross the line yourself .
what line?
the line i drew on the deck just now .
you weren't up there?
no .
you're kidding .
that was one of the most dramatic things that's ever happened on this boat .
i just lost all my best interns .
i thought you were supposed to be covering this story .
you just said it was all off the record .
yeah , but you didn't know that .
well , i was down here packing .
flipped the wrong breaker .
so , you are leaving .
you're jumpin 'ship on me .
i'm going to scrap the article .
you mean you're not even gonna write the cover story on me?
man , i just don't have any stature anymore .
sorry , steve .
everything just got too weird .
that's all .
but i gave you a goddamn showstopper up there .
are you sleeping with ned?
that's none of your business .
okay .
are ya?
no , i'm not .
you're gonna miss the jaguar shark .
or whatever it is if it actually exists .
are you crying?
you cry easily , don't you?
bloody hell .
god save that poor little stooge .
this never would have happened if eleanor was with us .
thanks , man .
your luck had better damn well change soon , mate .
now , i must away .
i'll send you a postcard from my travels .
wh ...
wait .
where are you goin '?
abroad for a spell , my darling .
it's my passport status , you see .
i'm x 9 at the moment .
legally , i'm a fugitive .
wait a second .
they stole my budget ... my boat's broken , you're ditchin 'me up the creek .
what am i supposed to do here?
well , i must say , nothing's jumping to mind .
phillip , any suggestions?
no , he's shaking his head .
land ho !
port au patois dead ahead !
port au patois !
port au patois !
ho !
ho !
ho !
land ho !
ho !
no .
i can't give you full credit , but i'm not gonna flunk you either .
you're all getting incompletes .
this is bullshit .
oh , shit .
what do you want?
do you mind if i butter you up a little bit before i answer that question?
yes , i do .
tell me now .
i need some money to get the boat out of hock ... and rescue my bond company stooge who got kidnapped .
could we ask your parents to loan it to me?
no .
okay .
could i go ahead and butter you up anyway?
it took me two and a half hours to get out here .
who's that dude?
that's my research assistant , javier .
javier , presento steve .
steve .
necesito cinco minutos , por favor .
you know , i'd be jealous about you staying at allie's place ... except i always thought he was kind of a closet queer .
so how's your father son relationship coming along?
well , nobody has a real lock on any of this , so i don't know how it all times out .
i mean , i know i want him to think of me like a father .
but the fact that there's an outside chance ... that he could really be my actual ... biological son ...
is very difficult for me .
you know i'm not big on apologizing .
so i'll just skip it if it's all the same to you .
okay .
anyway , i'm sorry .
i know i haven't been at my best this past decade .
that's true .
what happened to me?
did i lose my talent?
am i ever gonna be good again?
i don't know .
doesn't matter anyway .
it's probably the last adventure i've got in me .
i was hopin 'to go out in a flash of blazes ... but i'll probably just end up goin 'home .
unless you're plannin 'to sell the island .
i wonder how much i could get for it .
in this market?
you were probably right all along .
we should've had a kid together .
of course ... you were kind of already ... on the edge of bein 'too old .
unless maybe that's a cop out .
it's worse than a cop out .
i was 34 .
it's good to see ya , eleanor .
i'm about to blow my stack .
i turn my back , and the bullshit begins .
ned , you're a scumbag .
and , jane , you're a goddamn liar .
what the fuck are you doing in here?
what the " f " are you doing in here?
i warned you about being in other people's cabins .
you were supposed to go home .
well , you convinced me to stay and finish the story .
is it still the cover?
i don't fucking know .
don't you dare put on that uniform .
it's all i have with me .
i told you i have a bit of a thing for her .
not this one , " i said .
you said , " not this one , klaus .
so you heard me .
you're too old for me , steve .
well , you're pregnant .
can i have a word with you privately?
yes .
follow me .
are you two fighting?
i'll deal with you later .
look , steve .
i know we both like her ... and you're angry and embarrassed , but leave her out of it .
you think that's what this is about?
shit , ned .
what has that bull dyke been telling you?
all right .
i'm gonna warn you now .
be a gentleman .
what are you doin 'here?
i thought all you interns ran out on me .
i want to help you find that shark .
goddamn it .
thank ya , intern .
you're gettin 'an " a.
his name's nico .
who?
hello , vikram .
give me that camera .
i'm gonna smash it over your head .
cut !
i misread you , man .
i'm gonna have to rethink some shit .
you don't know me .
you never wanted to know me .
i'm just a character in your film .
it's a documentary .
it's all really happening .
well , damn you for that .
go to bed , you sons of bitches .
that pregnant slut's been playin 'us like a cheap fiddle .
that's it .
i'm gonna fight you , steve .
you never say , " i'm gonna fight you , steve .
you just smile and act natural ... and then you sucker punch him .
you fight your way , and i'll fight mine .
oh , listen , ned .
don't you try to ...
i think your team zissou ring might've caught me on the lip .
you call yourself my son , but ...
i just don't see it .
it's nothin 'personal .
what do you want?
nothin '.
that's so arrogant .
that's ...
screw off .
i can't believe i asked if i could call you dad .
of course you said no .
i let you call me stevesy .
it sounds better .
it doesn't mean the same thing .
a week before she killed herself ... my mother told me that you'd known about me since the day i was born .
is that a fact?
that's a fact .
i ought to have stayed in kentucky where i belong .
quiet .
somebody pay for this water taxi .
you got any petty cash on you?
remind me to send eleanor's parents a thank you note on the good correspondence stock .
okay .
this is the message we received earlier tonight ... on our answering machine at pescespada island .
bill ubell here .
i'm on a pay phone .
i am still blindfolded .
my arms are bound .
but a young boy has been kind enough to assist me .
there's not much chance i'll get another opportunity to call ... so i thought i would ask if ...
what?
no .
well , thanks for checkin 'in , bill .
next time maybe you could let us know where you're at .
based on the quality of the connection ... the variety of wildlife in the background ... and the elapsed time between mr. ubell's capture and this message ... there's a good chance he's on one of the ping islands .
there used to be a four star hotel on little ping .
but the entire island was destroyed by a monsoon five years ago .
it's been uninhabited ever since .
i know the place .
hotel citron .
cubbie , i'd like to speak on the record for a moment .
eleanor has always been the brains behind team zissou .
by the way ... are you gonna put in a good description of the command center i've set up down here?
okay , gang .
that's the plan .
set a course for ping island , full speed ahead .
you'll need to hire a team of mechanics to rebuild the engine first , of course .
i know .
i'm saying after that .
just because i've decided to save your neck again and help you do this rescue ... doesn't mean you've won me back .
yes , ma'am .
thanks .
is the father out of the picture?
mm hmm .
actually , i was sort of terrified about having this baby .
and right now i'm not really scared of anything .
maybe it's my hormones .
that makes sense .
i'm going to tell you something confidentially ... which won't be mentioned again .
i'm pretty sure i'm the only person who can say this , including steve .
never mind how i found out .
i'm a scientist .
it's the thing that puzzles me about ned's situation .
what is it?
zissou shoots blanks .
huh .
i think maybe it's because he spent half his life underwater .
let's try track three against picture .
a treacherous reef surrounds the ping islands ... warning intruders to keep their distance .
today we discover one of its victims off the coast of ping three .
our colleague alistair hennessey and his crew are nowhere to be found .
we will land at dawn .
not bad .
we'll temp it with that , anyway .
all right .
let's go !
oh , shit .
swamp leeches .
everybody , check for swamp leeches , and pull them off .
nobody else got hit?
i'm the only one?
what's the deal?
what a shame .
they had a bartender here , kino , made the best rum cannonball i've ever tasted .
you ready , vikram?
five six and a half .
all right .
shall we do this?
the barometer's falling .
it's gonna rain in five minutes .
we gotta be quick .
well , where are they?
unknown .
split into two groups .
i'll take ned , ogata and wolodarsky .
thanks .
thanks a lot for not picking me .
what?
we're smack in the middle of a lightning strike rescue op , klaus .
what's the deal?
i'm sick of being on " b " squad .
listen .
you may be on " b " squad , but you're the " b " squad leader .
don't you know me and esteban always thought of you as our baby brother?
i've always thought of you two as my dads .
please don't let anyone make fun of me for saying so .
i can't guarantee that , klausie , but i'll try .
can we get on with the maneuvers now?
wolodarsky , you got something?
not yet .
anybody see anybody?
empty .
klaus , pirates?
zip .
i think this whole place is deserted .
shit !
we played a bum hunch .
fuck .
okay , let's not get down on ourselves .
we still got two more ping islands to check out ... except i don't know if we have enough gas to do it .
damn it , steve .
this sucks .
i'm disappointed in myself .
my first wife , jacqueline , and i spent our honeymoon here .
things are pretty different now .
all right .
let's check out .
did you get that , vikram?
uh , yeah .
good .
we'll give them the reality this time .
a washed up old man with no friends ... no distribution deal , wife on the rocks ... people laughin 'at him , feelin 'sorry for himself .
can i have a word alone with my son , please?
are you all right?
not really .
by the way , i've been tryin 'to think of a nickname ... that might mean the right thing .
i came up with papa steve .
i'm sorry i never acknowledged your existence all those years .
it won't happen again .
i mean it .
you are my son to me .
almost more so .
see , for me to meet a guy like you at this time in my life ...
i don't know .
uh , it's just ...
i want to communicate my feelings to you ... but ...
i think i might start to cry .
that's okay .
psst !
there's something in the coat check .
hey , billy .
you okay?
did you get my message?
yeah .
it was kind of garbled .
oh .
jesus .
these pirates are monsters .
well , yeah , but remember i shot one of their guys in the neck last week and killed him ... so i think we're okay too .
where's cody?
cody?
steven .
are you rescuing me?
fold .
klaus !
bring the dynamite !
they're in there after all .
run !
go !
move !
now !
vikram got some great footage of your boat out there .
i guess it's totaled , huh?
perhaps , but we're extremely well insured .
i'll probably come out ahead in the end .
although we'll obviously have to crew up from scratch next time .
they made soup out of my research turtles .
ogata , give some first aid to pel .
klausie , ned o ... dig in here , and hold these rustlers off ... while i call in the rendezvous .
we'll meet on the beach .
you're " a " squad .
renzo .
renzo .
renzo .
anybody .
hello .
hello .
this gizmo's out of juice .
thanks .
no .
captain .
that's cedric .
he's a friend .
merci , cedric .
remind me .
we'll send him a red cap and a speedo .
wolodarsky , go get the keys to that fishing boat , and throw them in the water .
no , wait .
they might have another set .
just blow it up .
hey , ned .
it looks like we recovered your inheritance .
klausie .
that's it .
i'm retired .
oh , no .
we forgot cody .
we gotta go back .
good bye , cody .
see , this represents the belafonte .
and here's pescespada island .
and that circle represents friendship .
and the " k " here stands for klaus .
where's your symbol , ned?
oh , i didn't want to impose myself .
klaus is right .
the flag needs a ned symbol .
ah , i suppose we could put an " n " on the side of that octopus .
what's that stand for over there?
that's esteban .
well , it was workin 'okay until late last night ... but now the whole tracking system's gone completely on the fritz .
screw it .
we'll sell it for scrap along with the boat and the submarines .
i'm goin 'home .
let's take up the whirlybird and see what we find out there anyway .
i got a feelin 'we can spot this fish from 111 feet up .
ned , i don't know if i ever even saw the bastard .
i have $275, 000 invested in this damn production .
somethin 'ate esteban , didn't it?
now lead !
right?
right?
ho !
# see the dwarfs and see the giants #
ho .
# which one would you choose to be #
# and if you can't get that together #
# here's the answer here's the key #
# you can freeze like a 30 century man #
# like a 30 century man # what's that?
a letter from jane .
what does she say?
nothin 'to speak of .
thank you for putting me on the flag , ned .
of course , klaus .
it was my pleasure .
yeah , but you stitched me onto the dolphin ... and i want you to know how much that means to me .
well , i'm very pleased you liked it .
y you're not listening .
i didn't just like it .
you understand?
yes , i do .
thank you , klaus . # play it cool #
# like a 30 century man #
# be a 30 century man #
i've still got yours , of course .
my what?
dear captain zissou .
i am 12 years old and live in jawbone , kentucky .
a creek runs behind our house where i live with my mother .
she met you once some years ago ... and i collect and catalog amphibians , reptiles and insects .
i don't know what this one is called , so i named it myself .
you are probably my one of , if not the , favorite person i've ever studied .
i plan to be either , " a " , an oceanographer ...
b " , an architect , " c " , a pilot .
thank you very much for your good work .
sincerely , ned plimpton , blue star cadet , zissou society .
p. s. do you ever wish you could breathe underwater?
i still wish i could breathe underwater .
me too , ned .
fluorescent snapper !
what?
really?
what's that?
a good sign .
the last time we saw that big shitkicker , he ...
somethin 'popped up there , didn't it?
i heard a pin snap loose in the rotator mechanism .
this is gonna hurt .
ned !
ned !
ned !
hey , stevesy .
are you okay?
i think i'm okay .
what happened?
did we hit something?
most likely not .
i think maybe the pushrod failed .
i'm sorry , ned .
i should've scrapped this chopper 10 years ago .
you know , maybe i should've autorotated ... and performed a high bank through our descent .
we might've crashed a little softer .
probably wouldn't have made any difference though .
oh .
# should i try to hide #
# the way i feel inside #
# my heart for you #
# would you say that you #
jedidiah said to the israelites ...
# would try to love me too #
# in your mind could you ever be #
# really close to me #
# i can tell the way you smile #
# if i feel that i could be certain then #
# i would say the things i want to say tonight #
# but till i can see # all hands bury the dead .

# i will dream #

# i would say the things i want to say tonight #
# but till i can see #

# i'll keep tryin 'to hide the way i feel inside #
# when i live my dream #
this is the first time eleanor's ever cried in front of me as long as i've known her .
except for once when she got her arm caught in the deck winch .
is this my espresso machine?
wh what is ...
how did you get my espresso machine?
well , uh ... we fuckin 'stole it , man .
allie , why don't you go powder your nose .
i need to talk to your ex wife .
we've never made great husbands , have we?
of course , i have a good excuse .
i'm part gay .
supposedly everyone is .
i never told you this , but i was hoping ... we might get the chance to adopt ned .
i think he would've wanted it that way .
would you have gone along with me on that?
he was 30 , steve .
but i'd have considered it .
thanks , eleanor .
we're a dying breed .
yeah .
i guess we were all right while we lasted though , weren't we?
oh , we were like glory's gate , my darling .
we were like that bloody shark of yours .
we swam with the , um , uh ...
oh , goddamn it .
i had it on the plane .
what was i gonna say?
ah , well .
it's good to see you .
how's your passport status?
much better , thank you .
i'm back down to x 4 .
tell me .
who knocked up the reporter?
i don't know .
by the way , thanks for showing me the first draft .
you read it .
what did you think?
well , i was a little embarrassed at first .
obviously people are gonna think i'm a showboat and a little bit of a prick .
but then i realized ... that's me .
i said those things .
i did those things .
i can live with that .
you're a good writer , jane .
it's the f ing cover .
that a girl .
excuse me .
excuse me .
i'm sorry to interrupt ... but we just got the scanning monitor back up ... and it looks like the jaguar shark , or whatever it is that we're tracking ... is in a trench on the far side of the reef .
what the hell is going on in here?
cheap wiring .
anybody feel like going for a ride?
ned's theme . " take one .
i hooked a rhinestone bluefin on a rope to give him something to eat .
is that one of mine?
i think one of my research turtles survived .
looks good .
is that him?
that's him , klaus .
are we ...
are we safe in here?
i doubt it .
you still want to blow him up?
no .
we're out of dynamite anyway .
it is beautiful , steve .
yeah , it's pretty good , isn't it?
i wonder if it remembers me .
in 12 years he'll be 11 and a half .
that was my favorite age .
like this?
just like that .
you do it too .
we complete the adventure ... but another number of our crew has been lost .
this one was my son .
also our equity partner .
we start the voyage home in our wounded vessel .
ho .
ho .
this is an adventure .
# ah , yeah #
# oh , yeah #
# i'm up on the 11th floor and i'm watching the cruisers below #
# he's down on the street and he's trying hard to pull sister flo #
# oh , my heart's in the basement my weekend's at an all time low #
# 'cause she's hoping to score so i can't see her letting him go #
# walk out of her heart walk out of her mind #

# she's so swishy in her satin and tat #
# in her frock coat and bippity boppity hat #
# oh , god i could do better than that #
# oh , yeah #
# she's an old time ambassador of sweet talking night walking games #
# and she's known in the darkest clubs for pushing ahead of the dames #
# if she says she can do it then she can do it #
# she don't make false claims #
# but she's a queen and such are queens #
# that your laughter is sucked in their brains #
