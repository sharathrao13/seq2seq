she just looks at me , you know what i mean?
looks?
yeah , like i'm a plate of leftovers . i need a cadillac to connect with your sister?
somethin 'wrong with my face?
she's a freakin 'loser .
sometimes she gets me so crazy , i could split her head with a razor .
don't get mental .
you caught me in a bad mood .
you're always in a bad mood .
adrian ain't sharp .
adrian is a loser .
she's pushin '30 freakin 'years old . if she don't watch out , she's gonna die alone . i'm 30 myself .
and you'll die alone . i don't see no crowd around you neither . i'd like to kill the freakin 'moron who broke the mirror .
come on .
let's get out of this stink .
i wanna talk to you anyway .
about what?
you still work for gazzo?
yeah , sure .
why don't you talk to him about me? i just don't think gazzo's hirin 'right now .
you know?
come on .
the girl's dried up .

my sister . if she don't start livin ', her body's gonna dry up .
tomorrow's thanksgiving , you know that?

tomorrow you come for some bird , right?
absolutely .
you got it . i gotta go . if i'm ten minutes late , she calls the hospital .
paulie ! i got it . ... bicentennial fight with mac lee green ... here in philadelphia at the fabulous spectrum .
larry .
you're speaking now of your much publicized bicentennial fight .
right .
this is gonna be the greatest sporting event in the country's history .
a gala occurrence with me beatin 'green like he committed a crime .
would you take a look at that guy? i mean , where are the real fighters gonna come from?
the pros .
all we got today are jig clowns . ... on january 1 st .
the first major event in the country's
clown?
that's right , clown .
and in keeping with great events throughout the country's history ...
apollo creed will duplicate the cracking of the liberty bell by cracking green .
you're callin 'apollo creed a clown?
what else?
look at him .
stay in school and use your brain .
be a doctor , be a lawyer , carry a leather briefcase .
forget about sports as a profession .
sports make you grunt and smell .
be a thinker , not a stinker .
thanks a lot , champ .
you crazy?
this man is champion of the world .
he took his best shot and become champ .
what shot did you ever take?
hey , rocky , you're not happy with your life , that's nice .
but me , i got a business goin '. i don't have to take no shots . ... no one having gone more than 1 2 rounds with him ...
that's right . and that was jake dale last june .
stick that up your business .
why you gettin 'so insulted?
you want me to take a shot?
all right . i'll take a shot .
hey , rocky , how 'bout a bottle?
no wine , man .
come on . just a little .
buy us some thunderbird .
marie , does your brother know you're hangin 'out so late?
get lost , creep .
screw you , yo yo !
these guys teach you to talk like that?
stuff it !
don't you never say that to me .
you stink up the neighborhood !
you know , you can
when i was your age , only one girl in the whole neighborhood talked like that .
that was it . just one .
what are you doin '? it'll make your teeth yellow .
don't do that . i like yellow teeth ! it'll make your breath like garbage .
maybe i like garbage .
nobody likes garbage .
anyway , this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin '... but none of the guys ever took her serious .
they never took her out for any serious date .
why?
'cause that's the way guys are .
they laugh when you talk dirty .
they think you're cute .
after a while , you get a reputation .
you get no respect .
you understand?
you get no respect . i gotta use a bad word : whore .
you understand?
whore .
see?
you use dirty words , and maybe you end up becomin 'a whore .
come on , rocky . i'm 1 2 .
that don't matter .
you don't really have to be one .
just act like one and that's it .
boom !
bing !
you get a bad rep .
you understand?
twenty years from now , people are gonna say ...
do you remember marie?
no .
who was she?
she was the little whore who hung down at the atomic hoagie shop .
oh , yeah .
now i remember her .
you see , they don't remember you .
they remember the rep .
you understand?
you got a boyfriend?
no , you ain't got a boyfriend .
you know why?
why don't you think you have a boyfriend?
'cause you're hangin 'out with them coconuts on the corner .
you hang around coconuts , you get nowhere .
they're lemons .
lemons .
you hang out with nice people , you get nice friends .
you understand?
you hang out with smart people , you get smart friends .
you hang out with yo yo people , you get yo yo friends .
you see , it's simple mathematics . i hope you ain't  i won't .
what was i gonna say?
you hope i don't keep actin 'like a whore or i'll turn into one , right?
good night , rocky .
good night .
take care .
hey , rocky .
yo .
screw you , creep o !
yeah , who are you to give advice , creep o?
who are you?
are the doctor's reports confirmed?
definitely .
says here mac lee green has suffered ...
a severely cracked third metacarpal in his left hand .
damn !
we can cancel the fight indefinitely if you're set on fighting green .
hey , it ain't just green .
what about all the time apollo has invested?
we can find a solution .
solution nothin '.
find me another ranked contender in a flash, jergens .
don't play games with my client .
apollo's already done a million dollars 'worth of publicity ... has made contractual obligations with 20 different organizations .
he's not going to be embarrassed ! i contacted ernie roman's manager .
ernie's fighting in france that same week .
then get me buddy shaw .
he's ranked fifth .
went to california and gained 50 pounds . i called every worthwhile contender .
they all say five weeks isn't enough time to get into shape .
shape nothin ', man .
they're afraid .
they know everybody is gonna see this fight .
none of them's got a prayer of whippin 'me .
they're makin 'excuses so they don't have to be the chump who gets whipped .
all i can say is i'm a good promoter . i've promoted fights in every goddamn country in the world ... and i've broken my ass over this one . i don't know what else to do !
i do .
without a ranked contender , what this fight needs is a novelty .
this is the land of opportunity , right?
so , apollo creed , on january 1 st ... gives a local underdog fighter an opportunity .
a snow white underdog , and i'm gonna put his face on this poster with me .
and i'll tell you why .
because i'm sentimental .
a lot of other people in this country are just as sentimental ... and there's nothing they'd like better than to see apollo creed ... give a local philadelphia boy a shot at the greatest title in the world ... on this country's biggest birthday .
now that's the way i see it .... and that's the way it's gonna be .
apollo , i like it . it's very american .
no, jergens . it's very smart .
what is it? i wanna check this thing out .
you said pick up two yards from snyder and a grand from cappoli , right?
no , no .
two yards from cappoli and a grand from snyder .
two yards .
write it down , okay?
yeah , i got it .
who's this girl you're goin 'out with tomorrow night?
how'd you know? i know .
don't you think i hear things?
lot of canaries flyin 'around the docks . i'm goin 'out with paulie's sister .
hey , rocky .
what? i hear she's retarded .
she ain't retarded .
she's shy , you know?
tell you what to do .
take her to the zoo . i hear retards like the zoo .
this bum gotta say that?
who you callin 'a bum?
back it up , buddy . i'm callin 'you a bum !
relax , relax .
buddy's in a bad mood . it's his prostate .
he's always in a bad mood .
you oughta count your blessings .
you're still a healthy person . i don't like your face . i don't like yours either !
kiss my ass !
come out here !
relax !
relax .
my ears .
are you driving me crazy?
both of you .
look .
buddy doesn't like you .
some guys , they just hate for no reason .
capisce?
yeah .
come here .
here's 50 bucks .
you and your girl adrian , you have a nice time .
thanks .
how'd you know her name?
you don't think i hear things?
hey , rock .
what?
remember what i told you?
take her to the zoo .
come on outta the car !
some more coffee , mr. creed?
no , thanks , shirley .
what do you think about billy snow?
fouls .
how about big chuck smith?
no , he's too old and dumb .
hey , that bobby judge , he's a good boy .
no . i don't feel no heat from that name .
joe zack's a good prospect .
exactly what are you looking for , apollo?
this is what i'm lookin 'for .
the italian stallion .
rocky balboa?
never heard of him .
look , it's the name , man .
the italian stallion .
the media will eat it up .
who discovered america?
an italian , right?
what would be better than to get it on with one of his descendants?
he's a southpaw . i don't want you messin 'around with southpaws .
they do everything backwards .
southpaw nothin '. i'll drop him in three .
apollo creed meets the italian stallion .
sounds like a damn monster movie .
what are you doin 'with that bat? i used to be deadly at stickball .
your sister knows i'm comin '?
she's very excited .
look at these swollen hands .
yeah .
the joints from carryin 'meat in and out of the freezer .
plays hell on the joints .
maybe you oughta see a doctor . i don't need a doctor . i need a different job .
different job .
what kind of turkey?
big?
small?
talk to gazzo .
tell him i'm a good man .
nothin 'bothers me . i'd make a great collector .
bustin 'bones don't bother me .
don't bother you .
big turkey , right?
gazzo's gotta gimme forget gazzo . it's a bad job .
you got a match?
go to him for me .
as a favor .
yeah , yeah .
last time i had a turkey ... was when they had a two dollar special at horn and hardart's three years ago .
last year , me and the turtles had spam .
your sister knows i'm comin '?
yeah , yeah .
she's very excited .
will you forget about gazzo? i don't ask nobody twice .
don't ask nobody twice .
you're sure your sister knows i'm comin '?
yeah .
she's very excited .
paulie , you're late .
you call the hospital?
she calls the hospital if i'm ten minutes late .
yo , how you doin '? i told you , she's very excited .
why didn't you tell me you were bringin 'him here? i'm not ready for this .
would it make a difference if you were?
he's takin 'you out .
no , i can't . i want you outta the kitchen right now .
i won't .
i want you outta here instamatically ! i'm sick of seein 'you hanging around like a freakin 'spider .
go out and live .
enjoy life ! i can't go !
don't get wise with me now . i'm tired of you bein 'a loser .
don't call me that , paulie !
apollo creed says he'll be shopping for another victim ... to fill green's vacancy for the bicentennial championship fight
why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?
how do you know i didn't? i can't go , paulie . i won't go !
why?
paulie , it's thanksgiving . i got a turkey in the oven .
oh , a turkey in the oven .
turkey in the oven .
you want the bird?
go in the alley and eat the bird !
aw , paulie ! i want you outta here !
get outta the house !
go out and enjoy your freakin 'life !
you hungry , rock?
hey , yo , paulie , maybe we better forget all this , you know?
forget nothin '.
go ahead .
tell her somethin 'funny .
ain't nothin 'to talk about .
she's in a bad mood . i'm in a bad mood .
you can do funny things .
you wanna go out with my sister?
yeah .
well
i don't know what to say .
funny .
yo , adrian . it's me , rocky?
rocky , you know?
listen , uh i don't know what to say , 'cause i ain't never talked to no door before .
what do i say to a door?
we better forget this .
you're doin 'fine . i ain't doin 'fine . i look like an idiot .
keep doin 'what you're doin '.
funny . i know all about these things . i feel like a jerk .
yo , adrian , it's rocky again .
listen , uh , i know you ain't too happy at this moment .
but could you do me a favor? i ain't got nobody to spend thanksgiving with .
so , uh , how about maybe you and i ... go out together , get something to eat .
maybe laugh a little bit .
who knows , you know?
would you like to , uh
would you like to , maybe , you and me go out together?
what do you think?
would you like to?
we're gonna have a good time .
we'll have a real good time .
thanks for the bird .
i'm gonna turn the tv off . i got a headache .
what's your sister like to do? ice skate .
adrian , come on .
you're letting the heat out .
who pays the bills around here?
listen , i don't want no turkey anyway , you know?
but it was thanksgiving .
what? it was thanksgiving .
yeah , to you .
but to me it's thursday , right?
it looks kind of quiet . i think it's closed .
no , i think we're just early or something like that .
we're closed .
what? i said we're closed .
yeah .
hey , listen . i'm gonna smooth this guy out .
wait here . i'll be right back .
we could go someplace else .
no , it's okay .
are you closed to the general public , or are you just closed to everybody? it's after 6 : 00 . it's thanksgiving .
that's why there's nobody here .
besides , you ain't supposed to be in here .
so do me a favor and not stay here .
could you do me a favor?
come on .
we're not operatin '.
look .
this girl here ain't feeling well .
doctors say she should go out and exercise . ice skating's probably the best thing .
so what do you want from me?
you can see she ain't feelin 'too good . if you can let her on the ice for a few minutes , i'd appreciate it .
ten minutes , ten bucks .
ten bucks?
how about eight bucks?
come on . it's thanksgiving .
all right .
nine bucks , you got a deal .
you have the ice to yourself .
ten bucks .
give her the blades .
aren't you skating?
no , i ain't skated since i was 1 5 .
that's when i started fightin '.
skating's kind of bad for the ankles , you know?
you're a pretty good skater , aren't you?
like i was sayin 'before on the way over here ... fightin 'used to be tops with me , but no more .
all i wanted to do outta fightin 'was prove i was no bum that i had the stuff to make a good pro .
you never got the chance? i ain't cryin 'about it . i still fight . i do it like a hobby .
the trouble is i'm a southpaw .
what's a southpaw?
a southpaw means you're left handed .
a southpaw throws your timing off . it throws other guys 'timing off , makes them look awkward .
nobody wants to look awkward .
you know where " southpaw " came from?
nine minutes !
a long time ago , there was this guy maybe a couple hundred years ago he was fightin 'in the i think it was around philadelphia .
his arm he was left handed .
his arm was facing towards new jersey .
and that's south .
so naturally they called him " south paw . " you see?
southpaw , south jersey , south camden .
southpaw .
you know what i mean?
things probably worked out for the best , don't you think?
never got a chance because you're left handed , huh?
that's absolutely true , you know?
watch out .
ah !
ah ! i just dislocated my finger .
ah !
look at that .
wait . it ain't your fault .
look .
see? i had it it's an old wound .
you see that?
look .
see?
nothin '. it bends like that . i originally done it push the button .
bong . it works . it ain't your fault .
look .
seven minutes ! i originally done it i keep pictures of all my fights . i originally done it in the baby crenshaw fight .
baby's about the size of an airplane . i broke both hands on his face . i lost that fight , but that's a nice picture , don't you think?
real nice .
come on .
you havin 'a good time?
you can see i ain't too graceful . i don't move well , but i can really swat . i can really hit hard .
but i'm a southpaw , and nobody wants to fight no southpaw .
you know how i got started in fightin '?
am i talkin 'too loud?
three minutes !
my father , he's a my old man , he was never too smart .
he says to me , " you weren't born with much of a brain ... so you better start using your body .
so i become a fighter .
you know what i mean?
why you laughing?
my mother , she said the opposite thing .
what did she say the opposite?
she said , " you weren't born with much of a body ... so you better develop your brain .
did she say that?
yo , time !
can i ask you a question?
absolutely .
why do you wanna fight?
'cause i can't sing or dance .
don't fall !
that was terrific . i'm pretty good at this .
you like the way i skate?
last fight i had , i had with this guy named spider rico .
he busted my head up there .
you see that scar? i'll tell you , things get pretty rough in the ring .
you know , some people are very shy by nature . i suppose .
i say you're very shy by nature , you know? i suppose .
the bum from the dark .
get a job , you bum !
some people think that being shy is a disease ... but it don't bother me none .
don't bother me either .
so why'd i bother bringin 'it up?
'cause i'm dumb , that's why .
i think we make a sharp couple of coconuts . i'm dumb and you're shy .
what do you think?
i don't understand why anybody would wanna be a fighter .
you gotta be a moron to wanna be a fighter , you know what i mean? it's a racket where you're almost guaranteed to end up a bum . i don't think you're a bum . i'm at least half a bum .
but i'll tell you something .
worst thing about fightin 'is the mornin 'after .
you know?
morning after .
yeah , the mornin 'after a fight ... you're like a large wound , you know what i mean?
sometimes i got pains all over me . i feel like callin 'a taxi to take me from the bed into the bathroom .
your hair hurts , your eyes hurt .
your face is busted up .
your hands are swollen .
look at this face .
sixty four fights .
look at that nose .
you see that nose?
that nose ain't never been broken . i had guys bustin 'on it . i had guys chewin 'on it , twistin 'and punchin 'it . i mean , whack , boom .
these guys are hittin 'my nose all the time .
never broke it . i'm very proud of that .
that's rare .
why do you do it if it hurts?
why you think?
'cause ... you can't sing and dance?
yeah , somethin 'like that .
hey , you wanna come inside?
no , i gotta go .
hey , come on . i got some animals . i got these very rare animals inside .

remember that mountain? i had to get rid of that mountain .
they kept fall over and flippin '.

hmm? it's a nice couch . i don't know .
there's big bugs in there . it's safer over here .
you wanna sit down?
uh , these your parents?
yeah , that's both of them there . is this you?
yeah . i was eight years old .
that's the italian stallion when he was a baby .
come on over .
make yourself comfortable .

do you have a phone?
no , i had it pulled .
'cause people calling all the time ... and who needs the aggravation , right? interruptions?
who'd you wanna call? i wanna let my brother know where i am .
why?
i think he might be worried . i'll call your brother , if that's the problem .
yo , paulie !
your sister's with me ! i'll call you back later !
see ya !
you don't like the room , do you? it's fine . it's only temporary . it's not that .
what's the problem?
you don't like me?
you don't like the turtles?
what's the problem? i don't think i belong here . it's okay .
i don't belong here .
well , you know , it's okay , 'cause you're my guest .
i don't know you well enough . i've never been in a man's apartment alone .
well , they're all the same , you know?

when was he here?
about an hour ago .
they're probably lookin 'for sparrin 'partners for creed . i said that before , you dumb dago !
i been comin 'here for six years , and six years you been stickin 'it to me .
how come?
you don't wanna know !
yeah , i wanna know how come .
you wanna know? i wanna know now !
okay , i'm gonna tell ya !
you had the talent to become a good fighter , and instead of that ... you became a leg breaker for some cheap , second rate loan shark ! it's a livin '. it's a waste of life !
yes .
may i help you?
oh , you must be mr. rocky balboa .
mr. jergens's expecting you .
just a moment .
mr. rocky balboa to see you , sir .
fine .
please go in , mr. balboa .
can i have that?
oh , certainly .
thanks .
mr. balboa .
how are you?
george jergens .
take a chair , please .
thanks .
mr. balboa .
call me rocky .
rocky , you got any representation?
you have a manager?
uh , no , just me .
rocky , i've got a proposition i'd like to make to you .
about sparrin '?
beg your pardon? i know you're lookin 'for sparrin 'partners , and i'm very available . i'm sure you are .
absolutely .
sparrin 'with the champ would be an honor , and you know what , mr. jergens?
what? i wouldn't take no cheap shots . i'd really be a good sparrin 'partner .
you don't understand me , rocky .
my proposition's this .
would you be interested in fighting apollo creed ... for the world heavyweight championship?
listen , rocky .
apollo's seen you fight .
he likes you .
he wants to fight you .
well , it's just that , you see , uh ... i fight in clubs , you know , and i'm really a ham and egger .
this guy , he's the best , and , uh ... it wouldn't be such a good fight , but thank you very much . i appreciate it .
rocky , do you believe that america is the land of opportunity?
apollo creed does ... and he's gonna prove it to the whole world ... by giving an unknown a shot at the title .
and that unknown is you .
he picked you , rocky .
it's the chance of a lifetime .
you can't pass it by .
what do you say?
we wanna ask apollo a few questions .
apollo , how do you like the city of brotherly love?
well , just being in philadelphia makes me feel patriotic .
beautiful people in a beautiful city coming up to me on the street ... wishing me the best . i love my philadelphia brothers , and i'm proud to be an american .
apollo?
champ?
why did you agree to fight a man who has virtually no chance of winning? if history proves one thing ...
american history proves that everybody's got a chance to win .
didn't you guys ever hear of valley forge or bunker hill?
apollo? it is a coincidence that you're fighting a white man ... on the most celebrated day in the country's history? i don't know . is it a coincidence that he's fighting a black man ... on the most celebrated day in the country's history?
right on , apollo !
tell the truth , brother !
listen , apollo .
how do you feel about your challenger?
how do i feel about him?
come here , rock .
my main man .
rocky , ain't you italian?
yeah , i'm italian .
now what does that mean?
that means , if he can't fight , i'll bet he can cook .
do me a favor .
his lungs , punch out .
paulie .
rocky , how do you expect to fight apollo creed?
oh , jeez , you know , creed's the best . i guess i'll have to do the best i can .
tell me , rocky , just between us ... where did you get the name " italian stallion "?
oh , uh , i invented that about eight years ago when i was eatin'dinner .
rocky , now your payday will be $ 1 50, 000 .
any comment?
you got no comment , rocky , right?
no .
thank you , rocky .
wait a minute . i just wanna say hi to my girlfriend , okay?
yo , adrian , it's me , rocky .
you believe all this?
microphones and all that stuff .
you didn't .
thank you , rocky .
who you pushin ', man?
smack you in the mouth !
thank you , rocky .
don't it matter he makin 'you out a fool? i'd break his lips .
he's takin 'cheap shots .
don't bother me none .
yo , rocky , i guess you'll be lookin 'for people to help you out .
help what?
you know ... keep you livin 'the clean life . i do okay , you know .
you need someone to help with the exercise ... and someone standin 'by with a towel or runnin 'errands?
hey , yo , paulie , who cared about me yesterday?
nobody .
so i just think i'm gonna train myself , you know?
without such good people around to help you ... you don't have such a good chance .
einstein flunked outta school twice .
that so?
yeah .
beethoven was deaf .
helen keller was blind . i think rocky's got a good chance .
want me to get you a beer , paulie?
you lookin 'to do a good deed?
keep outta my freakin 'life !
what'd i do?
nothin '.
did i say something wrong?
you didn't say nothin '. it's all right .
that's right !
you didn't say nothin '!
nothin 'at all !
i gotta go .
where are the freakin 'pretzels?
i'd like to have a pretzel .
hey , we ain't got any beer?
i thought you were supposed to pick up some beer !
how'd you like hearin 'your name on tv tonight?
uh ... i was shocked .
why'd you do that?
you're puttin 'me on , right?
absolutely .
what time should i expect you?
about 7 : 00 .
okay .
hey .
you know how i said that stuff on tv didn't bother me?
it did .
listen , the reason i brought you here is because i ... i wanna know if you got any money for training expenses . i got a few dollars .
a few bucks?
here .
put this in your glove .
what's this?
500 bucks .
don't worry about it .
you know , you ain't never had any luck ... but i think this time lady luck may be in your corner .
what do you think?
maybe .
thanks for the money , tony . it's okay .
don't worry about it . i'll see ya .
wait a minute .
what?
you're in trainin '.
come on .
yo , tony .
what?
you gonna show up at the fight?
ringside .
i'll see ya .
hello , kid . i seen your light .
can i come in?
yeah , sure .
yeah .
good .
hey , it's a nice place here .
anyway , what i come to tell you is that ... that what happened to you is freak luck .
yeah , freak luck .
ain't it true?
look at the other guys .
they're good fighters , right?
they're colorful .
they got good records .
they fight their guts out for peanuts .
but you , you got a shot at the title !
freak luck is a strange thing , you know?
sure is .
can i sit down?
yeah , sure .
what the hell are those?
domestic turtles .
the one on the top is cuff and the other guy's link .
the rest are marbles .
yeah?
they make good soup .
anyway .
look , i'm here to warn you .
you gotta be very careful about this shot that you got at the title .
because , like the bible says ... you ain't gonna get a second chance .
yeah .
all right .
you thought of that , huh?
well , what you need ... is a manager .
a manager .
listen to me . i know , because i been in this racket for 50 years .
50 years , huh?
50 years . i've seen it all .
all of it .
you know what i done? i have done it all .
you should've seen me when i knocked ginny russell outta the ring .
outta the goddamn ring , i tell ya .
september 1 4 , 1 923 ... and it was the same night that firpo knocks dempsey outta the ring .
so who gets the publicity?
figure that out .
dempsey .
that's right .
but why?
'cause he was champ .
no !
because he had a manager . i had nothin '.
i wanna show you somethin '. i want you to look at my face .
look at this . i got 2 1 stitches over this left eye . i got 34 stitches over this eye .
you know i had my nose busted 1 7 times .
the last time was in that fight with sailor mike . i got that clippin 'here . it was a good fight .
wanna read that?
well , it doesn't matter .
anyway , he put this vegetation on my ear .
you kind of remind me of the rock , you know that?
you really think so?
that's right .
you move like him , and you got heart like he did .
yeah , i got heart , but i ain't got no locker , do i , mick?
uh ... anyway
you know , when i begun in this business , kid i wanna make a suggestion .
don't drink that piss before a fight . it's no good for you . if you don't mind my sayin '.
anyway , you know , when i started in this racket ... pugs like us , we was treated like dogs .
for ten bucks , you gotta tear somebody's throat out .
but i never had no management .
one time , this son of a bitch that i fought ... he put a nail right there . in his thumb . in the thumb of the glove .
he punched so many holes in my face , i had spit shootin 'outta my cheeks .
can you imagine that?
anyway , when i tell you what i looked like when i was in my prime ... i want you to look at somethin '.
look at that .
that's the way i looked ... before these guys got at me .
that's nice .
you didn't take very good care of the picture , though .
well , i never had no management .
that's the trouble , but i got all this knowledge . i got it up here .
now i wanna give it to you . i wanna give you this knowledge . i wanna take care of you . i wanna make sure that what happened to me doesn't happen to you .
you know what i mean?
mick , the fight's set .
listen to me . i wanna be your manager .
you follow that?
fight's set . i don't need no manager .
but you can't buy what i'm gonna give you . i got pain and i got experience . i got pain and i got experience too .
listen , kid
hey , mick . i needed your help about ten years ago , right?
ten years ago .
you never helped me none .
you didn't care . if you wanted help i say , if you wanted help , why didn't you just ask me , kid? i asked , but you never heard nothin '!
well , i i , uh i know i i'm 76 years old .
and , uh
took you long enough to get here .
took ten years to come to my house .
you don't like my house?
my house stink?
that's right , it stinks ! i didn't ask no favors from you !
talk about your prime .
what about my prime , mick?
at least you had a prime ! i ain't had no prime . i ain't had nothin '.
legs are goin ', everything is goin '.
nobody's givin 'me nothin '.
guy comes up , offers me a fight .
big deal .
wanna fight the fight?
yeah , i'll fight the big fight . i'm gonna go fight that big fight and i'm gonna get that ! i'm gonna get that !
and you wanna be ringside and see?
do ya?
you wanna help me out?
do you wanna see me get my face kicked in?
legs ain't workin ', nothing's workin '.
think i'll go and fight the champ .
yeah , i'll fight him .

and you come around here .
you wanna move in with me?

this whole place stinks .

it's only about 28 degrees .
we'll check that forecast . i feel very mischievous , very weird , very i got vinyl seats in my car .
when i hit those seats this morning , i just went , " whoo ! " i figure if i'm up , everybody in the delaware valley should be up .

28 degrees . it's cold out there .
we deserve it .
we've been getting away with murder the last couple of weeks .
our high today could be
tonight we're back down in the 20 degree range .
a little colder in the suburbs .
tomorrow , with a little bit of luck , we may hit 40 .
but it's 28 . it's awfully chilly .
make sure you have it bundled up before you bring it out .
come on . it stinks in here , you know?
yeah . i know .
did you kill all these things?
no , across the street .
it's like an animal morgue . it's a little cold in here , ain't it?
yeah .
who killed all these things?
are you crazy , paulie? if you don't pay gazzo , you end up on a hook .
gazzo's a good man .
you know that .
don't get excited . i know that .
that's why i wanted you to talk to him about me and the collectin 'job . i can get me outta this stinkin 'freezer .
why don't you do yourself a favor?

she's got gaps . i got gaps .
together we fill gaps .
you ballin 'her?
you don't talk dirty about your sister .
are you screwin 'my sister?
you see?
that's why i can't connect you with gazzo .
because you got a big mouth .
you just talk too much . it's cold in here . i'm goin 'home .
cold in here? it is cold in here ! it stinks in here , and you stink !
you're breakin 'the ribs .
if you do that to apollo creed , they'll put us in jail for murder .

what we're going to do is ask you a few questions .
just a few questions about your unique training method .

let's roll it .
rocky , turn around here .

today we're here with heavyweight challenger rocky balboa .
the reason we're standing in this the meat guy's stickin 'his face in .
let's try it again , rocky .
today we're here with heavyweight challenger rocky balboa .
the reason we're standing in this refrigerated box ... is that mr. balboa has an unusual method of training . in a moment , he'll demonstrate that for the viewing audience at home .
but first , rocky , how did you come to train in an icebox?
uh , well , uh , my friend , the guy over there ... he let me in one day , and i hit the beef here and liked it ... and since i've become a challenger , the owner don't mind that i come in . is this a common training method?
do other fighters pound raw meat?
naw , i think i invented it .
would you give us a demonstration?
confirm the reservation ... for my people at ringside , and fly my barber to philly .
how much is being channeled into west coast closed circuit advertising?
300, 000 .
make it 450 .
and send the mayor's wife 200 roses from me ... and make sure we get a picture of it for all the newspapers .
do you want to run the 1 5 radio spots in the midwest?

george , i like your friends .
hey , champ .

diana lewis in the meat house ... with southpaw rocky balboa .
and he called the reporters?
yeah .
threw my training schedule off .
don't be mad at him .
he's tryin 'to help .
adrian , i ain't mad ... it's just that when reporters are around , i get outta joint ...
'cause they take cheap shots , and paulie knows that .
and paulie keeps askin 'me for a job all the time ... but he don't know nothin 'about fightin '.
are you gonna say anything to him?
what's to say? i just don't know what he wants from me .
i don't want nothin 'from you .
i don't want nothin 'from you .
this ain't no charity case .
get outta my house . it's not just your house .
you're no friend no more .
get outta my house , i just says .
don't talk to him like that .
both of you get outta my house !
it's cold outside , paulie .
i don't want you messin 'her ... and i don't raise you to go with this scum bum !
yeah?
come on !
you wanna hit on me?
come on ! i'll break both your arms so they don't work for you .

that's what i think of gazzo !
now you're a big shot fighter , you don't even throw a crumb to your friend .
when i go and get your meat every mornin '!
you forgot that?
and then i even give you my sister too !
only a pig would say that ! i'm a pig?

you can't live by yourself ! i put you two together , and don't you forget it !
you owe me !

you're supposed to be good to me !
what do i owe you , paulie? i treat you good ! i cook for you , i clean for you , i pick up your dirty clothes ! i take care of you , paulie ! i don't owe you nothin '!
and you made me feel like a loser !
i'm not a loser !
you're busted !
what?
you're not a virgin !
you let a man take down your pants !
she's busted !
i can't haul meat no more !
you want a roommate?
absolutely .
okay , now when you walk into the ring ... with the number one heavyweight of the world ... you'll be ready , won't ya?
why?
because i waited for 50 years ... to make you ready .
you'll be able to spit nails , kid !

you're gonna become a very dangerous person .
yo , mickey .

what do you get out of it?
paulie gets three grand . i get the robe .
shrewd .
the story about tonight's fight , their difference in style ... you can quote a recent sports magazine which said ... it could be " the caveman against the cavalier . " i notice a buzzing in the background .
could be the challenger is getting ready to get into the ring .
rocky , look at my date .
cost me $200 .
250 . i gotta go . i gotta work .
how's the robe?
a little baggy .
a 50 to 1 underdog living a cinderella story ... and he's captured people's imaginations all over the world .
we love you , rocky !
good luck , champ .
thanks for showing up .
and his record , 44 victories .
he's had 38 by knockout , and he's lost 20 fights .
which makes me wonder , can he stand it?
you know , the stamina and the skill to last three rounds .
because las vegas odds say no .
rocky balboa , climbing into the ring now .
the italian stallion .
some meat sign on the back of his robe .

shamrock meat

they have spotlights . i see right back there . is that the world heavyweight champion , apollo creed?
he's riding in a boat . is he supposed to be george washington?
obviously so .
he's got the hat on , the whole thing .
the world champion , apollo creed ... is doing an imitation of george washington .
he's throwing money .
