68 squares of ankle busting fury .

she's just as god made her ...
plump as a christmas goose .
dad ... the kids at school said my butt's big .
that's ridiculous , honey .
you're the cutest little girl i know .
you just have what is known as ...
the simpson butt .
permit me to elaborate .
every simpson starts with a circle .
daddy has one big circle here ... ... then a smaller one up here ... two big , sexy circles for eyes ... one macho muzzle ... then a snappy new outfit .
ooh , i'm looking good .
ooh , cuffs .
yeah .
and for some reason , my hair and ear form an " m " and a " g.
party !
party !
party !
party !

to downsize my derriere ,
i just tie a sweater around it .

oh , homer , you're wasting away to nothing .
you simply must eat something .
well , you're the boss .
oh , i love to see my man eat .
check it out , homes .
you said if i ever got a hundred on a test ,

i gave a test on state capitals , but i forgot to roll up the map .
everyone got a hundred .
i win .
p a r t.
par tee .
people , please .
it's a school night .
i thought you two broke up .
this means nothing .
yes , yes , you've made that quite clear .
maybe a different outfit would make me look thinner .
this store makes me feel even worse about myself .
i heard she's back to her birth weight .
must be nice .
no , no , the body on this mannequin is all wrong .
i know .
it's such an unrealistic standard for young ...
planing down the thighs ,
i make four bucks an hour planing down the thighs .
i don't look so bad .
don't worry , lisa .
you can still find someone to love you .
now you've got no choice .
non !
oh boy , barty's gonna party .
he sure is ... if he can keep up with these party animals .
aunt patty , aunt selma , grandma bouvier and ...
grampa .
martin and ralph .
bart's my bestest boyfriend .
oh mom , this guest list sucks .
it's the best i could do on such short notice .
where's milhouse?
he's got the measles .
but we've got him on speakerphone .
rock on .
you know , the first time i met bart was at recess in first grade ...
oh , i told him to use a land line .
okay , gang , let's get this party started . or should i say barted?
for our first game ,
i need everyone to draw a picture of president eisenhower .
i drew him with canadian prime minister louis st. laurent .
their relationship was frosty at best .
duck , duck , duck , duck , duck , duck , duck , ...
say " goose , " you stupid freak .
oh , mom , this was the worst party ever .
gee , i did the best i could ...
here's lisa .
she'll save the party .
honey , sit down .
have a big slice of cake .
what?
i'm not fat enough already?
how could you say that to me?
lisa , wait ...
hello?
hello?
i had to leave 'cause my french bread pizza dinged .
hello?
duck , duck , duck , duck , duck , duck , duck , ...
what's the big deal ...
bart didn't like his presents .
so what?
it's not like he gives us such great gifts .
remember that maple leaf ironed between the sheets of wax paper?
what was that?
that was crap .
oh , it's not just the presents .
the kids don't appreciate me anymore .
they'd rather hang out with their friends than with their mom .
so they're growing up .
soon they'll be leaving the nest , and you'll have time for yourself . hundreds of thousands of hours ,
and then , the peace of the grave .
no !
no , i've got a lot more mothering left in me .
i'll be right here at 3 : 00 to pick you up .
then i'll take you to the zoo .
we can eat fries out of a safari hat !
no , thanks .
i'm going to stay in the library and do a little reading .
well , i guess it's just you and me , bart !
mom , after that lame party you threw ,
i'd rather hang out with thunder thighs here .
they grow up so fast .
they're just asserting their independence .
if a child doesn't do it now , it may never happen .
seymour !
do you want your vitamin in applesauce?
or are you gonna take it like a big boy?
applesauce .
oh , sure , you love me now , but you'll turn .
stop struggling and get in my mouth , jerks !
aren't you the boy who beats up my son?
prob'ly .
what's your name?
simpson .
oh , yeah .
bart simpson .
spiky hair , soft kidneys , always hitting himself?
those tadpoles are your lunch?
technically , brunch .
well , here , take this .
my daughter didn't want the lunch i made .
this sandwich rocks .
my tadpoles seem crude by comparison .
you're nocturnal .
you don't have to impress me by making fun of others .
i already like you .
i'm starting to let down my guard .
thanks , mrs. s.
today didn't totally suck nard .
it's nice to be appreciated .
whatever .
take it sleazy .
mom? !
nelson?
i thought you were sleeping in the park tonight .
oh , that's okay , the kid don't bother me none .
hey , nelson , say hello to moe .
he said he'd take you camping sometime .
i said i might .
hey , kids ,
i just heard they canceled league night down at the bowling alley .
you know what that means?
open lanes !
whaddya say?
it'll be blam !
bart , lisa and ...
mom .
mom , when i want lame and needy , i'll call milhouse .
no offense .
fine !
i'll take my mothering elsewhere .
ooh , great roll , nelson .
here , i cut up your hot dog for you .
wow , hot dogs are awesome !
you've never had one before?
no , but i saw some in a catalog once .
people in sweaters were eating them at a picnic .
so , my mom works at hooters , but her dream is to go to vegas and work in a real strip club .
and , uh , where's your dad in all this?
he went out for a pack of cigarettes and never came back .
he said " smell ya later , " but he never smelled me again .
nelson , how'd you like to earn some extra money around our house?
i have some odd jobs my kids won't do .
yeah .
i get the feeling bart isn't everything he could be in the son department .
sometimes i think he's more interested in his " itchy and mitchy " cartoons than me .
i'm sure it's just a phase ,
like when i used to stand on the overpass and drop computers on the freeway .
that's how we get our kaypro .
64 , 65 , 66 ...
hey , lisa .
are you counting how many days it takes to wash your big butt?
i can't hear you .
that's because your butt blocks your ears .
that doesn't make any sense .
neither does your butt .
i know this obsession with thinness is unhealthy .. and anti feminist ... but that's what a fat girl would say .
lis , look !
now , i know there's a handsome young man behind all that hair and dirt .
maybe not , but you did a great job on the lawn .
thanks , dingus ...
i mean , ma'am .
my mother ... my bully ... my god !
lisa , just take a bite .
one bite ...
that's all i ask !
now , i can't have toothpaste tonight .
here's the money you gave my son .
we don't want your charity .
i didn't give your son charity .
i gave him self respect .
self respect , huh?
no wonder he came home with his vest all buttoned ...
like he was somebody .
go home to your son , mrs. muntz , and try not to have intercourse on the way !
nelson , what are you doing out this late?
my mom ditched me !
she went to hollywood to be an actress , but her range is limited !
she's still your mother .
come inside .
can i get you a glass of milk?
cow milk? !
what are you doing in my jammies?
i'm your new roommate .
i call top bunk .
but ... it's a single bed .
i said top bunk !
mom , the reason god invented dead bolts ... is to keep people like nelson out of your house .
bart , have you ever eaten a tootsie pop?
you know , there's a tough , crunchy shell , but if you lick it , there's a delicious sweetness inside .
be nice to nelson , and i'll give you a tootsie pop .
morning , losers .
mrs. simpson .
pancakes , my favorite !
bart , eat up or you'll be late for school .
i'm not hungry .
you heard the lady , clean your plate !
savor it .
let the flavors dance on your palate .
next on abc ,
who's dropping by to see george lopez?
we pray it's you !
open .
nelson , doesn't that hurt your teeth?
my teeth hurt all the time .
i just try to think about motorcycles .
i don't like the sound of that .
tomorrow i'm taking you to dr. shapiro .
a doctor for your teeth?
what's next , a lawyer for your hair?
papa , can you hear me?
papa , can you see me?
papa , can you find me in the night?
papa , are you near me?
papa , can you hear me?
papa , can you help me not be frightened?
looking at the skies i seem to see a million eyes ...
which ones are yours?
i gotta do something about him .
this is the perfect test .
if i can have one dab of frosting and then stop ,
i'll know i've conquered food at last .
that was too easy .
if i stop here , i still have some dignity .
well , at least she's not singing streisand .
hey lis , still insecure about your body?
yeah , a little .
those mean girls just get to me .
i understand .
i have a sister ...
i think she's dead now who had the same problem .
and i know just the solution .
sherri .
terri .
the only thing sweeter than you two ... are these stolen cookies .
enjoy .
thank you , nelson .
sherri smells , terri smells
stinky all the way
stink stink stink , stink stink stink
one horse open sleigh
thank you , nelson .
he who haw haws last , haw haws best .
i really appreciate you teaching those mean girls a lesson .
tomorrow i can bleach a swear word into their hair .
i'd like that .
nelson?
papa !
you came back !
i never meant to leave you , nelson .
but something awful happened when i went to the store .
well , that explains a lot .
who's hungry?
no .
i want to hear what happened at the store .
well , i went in to buy cigarettes ...
could you gift wrap them , please?
they're for my son .
i also bought myself a candy bar , which , uh , unfortunately was filled with peanuts , to which i am allergic .
i ran outside just as the circus was rolling into town .
and that's where i found him .
i brought him back here so he could take nelson away , and my bruises would heal .
i want to give you a home again , son .
and so do i.
mom !
i got an acting job .
from the third director i slept with .
i play lady macbeth .
i don't have to take my top off , but i do anyway .
well , i'm glad everything worked out so well .
the muntzes are back in business .
yep , the four muntzes .
thanks for finding my dad , bart.
and thanks , lady , for making me feel good about myself .
so , now that you're happy again ,
i guess you won't beat me up at school anymore .
i wish it were that simple .
i really do .
they're a family again .
and so are we .
what happened?
sometimes you have to adopt your son's bully in order to bring your own family temporarily closer .
and lisa , what have you learned?
nothing .
like many women , i still have an unhealthy obsession with my weight .
but talking about the problem is the first step towards the solution , right?
i guess .
but there's a long way to go .
come on , say something conclusive .
i'm afraid this is a very open ended problem .
oh , open ended? !
oh , come on , lisa .
say everything's fine .
everything's fine .
that was you .
prove it .
