more news in just a minute .
jiji , i've decided !
i'm gonna do it tonight !
mom !
oh , hi , miss dora .
it's gonna be completely clear tonight .
mom , i heard the weather forecast .
there's gonna be a full moon .
kiki , did you borrow your fathers radio again without permission?
yes , im sorry .
happy to see you miss dora .
mom , my mind is made up .
its tonight !
weren't you gonna put it off a month?
but the next full moon might be a cloudy night .
i want to make sure i leave on the perfect night .
wait , kiki !
my , my , whats this leaving business?
it's one of our old customs .
when a witch turns 13 , she leaves home for a year to begin her training .
your little baby is already 13?
time flies so quickly , doesn't it?
i'm afraid so .
but nobody leaves home that young anymore .
i remember perfectly well ... the exact day you arrived here in this town .
a little 13 year old gitl came down from the sky ... riding a broomstick , her eyes shining .
i had thought that you were a bit stuck up .
but she knows not much besides flying .
she hardly knows any of my formulas .
after i'm gone , who will make this medicine?
sign of time i'm afraid .
everything changes , bit by bit .
but i have to say , nothing works as well for my rheumatism .
you're always telling me to hurry !
now who's the slowpoke?
i think its better to leave with decorum and great dignity .
if we put it off for a month ... and i find some wonderful boyfriend , then what?
we'll never leave !
i'm worried about once you decided , you can't go back .
sure , i know that .
good , it's there .
i'm so exited !
its like getting a birthday present !
oh !
dad !
you know what?
i've decided to go tonight !
tonight?
yes , i just made up my mind !
well , yes , but what about our camping trip for this weekend?
i'm sorry !
but , ahm ....
yes , i'll expect you then .
thanks .
hi , mom .
i wanted to make sure you knew that kiki is leaving tonight .
yes , midnight .
hey , looks great !
i wish it had a different color .
witches have worn that color for over a thousand years
black cat , black clothes
kiki , it's not important what color your dress is .
what matters is the heart inside it .
i know that having a good heart is very important .
i wish i could show you that my heart is ready .
just follow that heart and keep smiling !
jawohl !
be sure to write home as soon as you've found a place .
dad !
can i please take the radio?
mom , you said i could have his radio !
yeah !
well , that radio is yours now !
okay , now let me have a look at my little witch .
you look just like your mother did when she was your age .
daddy ... would you pick me up like you used to?
well ...
how come you never told me you were growing up so fast?
you can always come home if things don't work out .
come back to my old room?
no way !
i hope you find a good town .
i bet it's real tough to find a town to live in by yourself .
don't worry , kiki will be fine .
what kind of town are you looking for?
a big town?
yeah .
by the ocean i hope .
ohhh !
i'm so jealous of you !
but i'm not going for a good time .
i'll be training hard ... at least a year !
yeah but they'll have discos , won't they?
kiki , its almost time .
okay .
thats the broom you're leaving on?
yeah , i just made it .
pretty cute huh?
it is cute , but you can't start witchin on a broom that's too small .
here , better take mine .
but mom , that one's so old !
that's why you should have it .
it never loses its way , even in a storm .
kiki , trust me .
but i worked so hard on it , right jiji?
your mothers broom would be better .
you rotten traitor !
kiki , he's right .
you can make yourself another broom when you get settled down .
be careful .
go , get 'em .
good bye !
go and have a good time !
go go !
kiki ...
go go !
kiki ...
she hasn't quite got the hang of it yet .
she's well past the lake and doing just fine .
i'm going to miss the sound of that little bell ...
which way are we headed?
i think south , to the ocean .
jiji , climb up and turn on the radio .
i don't think i can right now .
klki's dellvery servlce
good evening !
it was ....
newcomer i suppose?
i sure am .
i just left home tonight .
would you mind turning off that music?
i prefer to fly without accompaniment .
is it really hard to get settled in a place you've never been?
oh yes , lots can go wrong .
but since i'm good at fortune telling , i can handle everything .
fortunes?
in fact , i've started telling fortunes about love lately .
whats your special skill?
oh ...
i haven't made up my mind yet .
uh huh?
well , i'm nearly finished with my training period .
it'll be terrific to go home with confidence .
that's my town down there .
it's not big or terrible interesting , but i like it .
good luck to you .
thanks !
good bye !
disgusting .
what a stuck up cat .
i have to have a special skill .
what was that about good weather?
i hope you're not going to do , what i think you're going to do? !
we'll sleep here until the storm is gone .
won't we get into trouble?
not if nobody finds us .
i'm soaked thorugh .
do you fell anything moving?
this smells great !
sorry .
we didn't mean to fall asleep in your breakfast .
jiji , you've got to see the ocean !
i don't belive it !
it's huge !
it's only a puddle to me .
aw , come on !
that one is giant .
think there might be other witches there?
how would i know?
let's go !
jiji , you allright back there?
look !
a big town by the sea !
can you belive my luck?
a clocktower and everything !
what if there are some witches living here?
there may not be .
am i gonna like it here !
it's a little big for my taste .
bless my hourglass .
if that ain't a witch !
good morning !
are there any other witches in this town?
no , can't say i've seen a single one of 'em lately .
how about that?
our trip is over , we'll settle down here !
thanks mister !
bye !
don't mention it .
tell me we're not landing down there .
of course we do .
everybody is looking at us .
i know .
smile and make a good first impression .
well , you see , i'm a witch .
my name is kiki .
this is my black cat jiji .
we'd be honored of we could live here .
we'd love to live here .
you have a wonderful bell tower .
we're glad you like it my dear .
bye !
hey kid , what were you doing jumping into the street like that?
you almost caused an accident .
you must be crazy , zooming around on a broom in public !
i'm a new witch , sir .
we're supposed to fly around .
you're supposed to obey the law the same as all other people .
what's your name and address?
are you gonna tell my parents?
of course .
if its necessary .
i have to .
you're a minor .
thief !
somebody stop him !
stop , thief !
don't you move from there !
kiki ....
wait !
it worked out pretty good huh?
good plan to get rid of that cop , huh?
i was the one yelling " thief !
you are a real witch , right?
can i take a look at that broom?
hey tombo !
isn't it a bit early to go on girl hunting?
hey you guys , shut up !
let me look at your broom , please?
just for a minute .
i didn't ask for your help .
i guess i have to thank you ... but it was rude from you to do something without introducing yourself?
how old fashioned .
you sound like my grandma .
go away and leave me alone !
what a cool witch !
stay here alone?
i don't understand .
aren't your parents here with you?
no .
i'm a witch , so since i'm 13 , ...
i'm supposed to be completely independant .
may i see your indentification?
never mind then .
are you going to eat that?
you can have it .
its going to get dark fairly soon ...
let's go .
let's find another town .
there must be plenty like this one , perhaps even bigger .
lady !
your pacifier !
lady !
you forgot this !
what am i going to do?
when that baby wakes up ... and doesn't find this , it's gonna cry .
i'm sorry , sir , but could you wait just a minute?
i'll be right back .
should i bring it down to her?
what?
the woman with the baby carriage , right?
it'd be easy .
i'd really like to .
that'd be a big help .
thank you very much .
my pleasure .
jiji , let's go .
wow !
sorry to startle you ... but you left this pacifier in the bakery .
here you go .
i'd like one of those .
sure .
hi !
come on in !
thank you .
thank you .
bye .
there you go
i must say , i nearly fainted when i saw you fly off .
that woman told me to give you this message right away .
i got the pacifier you sent ...
be sure to thank your little friend .
she's an absolute angel .
i'm glad i could help .
bye .
where are you going so fast?
wait , please have something to drink !
come up here .
sit down and relax .
want some hot chocolate?
yes ...
thank you .
and this is for you .
let me guess , you're a witch in training?
yes , but people don't seem fond of witches in this town .
there are many kind people in this town who will like you .
take me for instance .
i like you very much .
have you found a place to stay yet?
you should have told me you hadn't .
we have a vavant room in the attic you can stay in .
you'd give me a room? !
i'd be happy to .
let me introduce myself .
i'm , osono .
my name is kiki , and this is my cat jiji .
its not very clean at the moment , but its all yours .
thanks .
bathroom and water are downstairs .
don't hesitate to ask for anything .
thank you !
there's flour everywhere .
at this rate , i'll be a white cat by morning .
jiji , come take a look at the ocean from here .
shall we try to find another town?
what a snob she is .
i've decided not to leave this town .
maybe i can find others like osono ... who will accept me for what i am .
how much do you think a phone would cost to put up here?
a phone?
yeah , for my business .
good morning everyone .
did you sleep well?
yes .
that smells good .
can i help out?
a delivery service , huh?
i have one skill flying so i thought ... a delivery service would be a good idea .
everyone will love it .
kiki's flying deivery service .
and you can base your business out of you room upstairs ... if you want to .
if i want to? " oh boy !
i'd like to put a phone up there .
but a phone costs money .
i've some saved up already .
don't waste it .
why not use our phone?
it takes time to get regular costumers .
if you help in the bakery ... you won't have to pay the phone bill .
i need a lot of help since i'm expecting a baby .
and i'll throw in free breakfast too .
thank you !
i'll do my very best for you !
you're such a wonderful person .
jiji , come on !
i'm all alone .
it's time to go shopping .
stop jumping out on the street .
we're not at home .
i'm sorry .
i won't do it again .
i wish i had something pretty to wear besides this robe .
boy , this is expensive ...
kiki , look , its me !
do you have any money left?
a little .
we just have to eat pancakes for a while .
wow !
those are beautiful .
wait !
pull over a second .
hey yo !
miss witch !
turn around !
no flying today?
what did i tell you?
black is all she wears .
wait !
come back !
i'm sorry , i was only kidding !
kiki , perfect timing .
a lady wants you to deliver something .
she's your first customer .
customer?
i'll be right back !
the map !
this lady is a customer of ours .
we were talking about your delivery service .
you are a cute little witch .
my name is kiki , ma'am .
i've heard wonderful things about you .
could you deliver this tonight?
yes .
it's my nephews birthday .
and urgent job came so i can't get there myself .
where do you want it delivered?
thats me ....
it won't be too far?
i ca fly there directly from here .
how much do you want?
i haven't really set a price yet .
is this enough?
this is more than ehough .
thank you very much ma'am .
oh wow !
that's great .
i certainly wish that i could fly ...
yeah !
hey , do you know that girl?
how high do you intend to go?
its my first delivery .
i don't want to be stopped by that police officer .
i was afraid you were going to deliver this to the angels .
i'm guessing its just beyond the cape .
here we go !
jiji , i'm liking this town more and more .
i'm not suer what i think .
i'll finally be able to write mom .
those are wild geese .
wonderful !
they're flying along with us !
why are they so upset?
they say a wind is comming .
they also say they're going higher .
i'm sorry !
i oww , oww !
please !
i'm sorry !
i wasn't trying to steal your eggs !
i've never been so scared .
its your fault .
they warned us of that wind , but you didn't listen .
you're right .
that's beautiful .
they were able to fly that high up with the wind .
kiki !!
the toy is gone !
what?
oh no !
we've got to get back to where we fell !
they're saying " the egg thief is coming again !
what are we gonna do?
hey !
don't do that !
stop it !
stop it !
go away !
we're in trouble .
they're still upset .
witches get no respect these days .
crows used to be witches servants .
that was a long time ago , okay?
how about we go in after the forest is dark , get in and get out?
we'll never make it in time .
there's only one way to do it .
they'll find out i'm a fake !
after i find it , i'll be right back to help you out .
is that the place?
yes .
don't move a muscle .
can i breathe?
hold it as long as you can .
yea !
give me my present !
that's pretty weird .
a bit late aren't you?
after my sister telephoned we were wondering where you were .
i'm sorry .
oh .
could i please have your signature?
mom , can i put the canaries in here?
uh huh , but be careful you don't let any of them escape .
okay .
thank you , have a nice day .
come on birdie !
i'm gonna put you in a bigger house !
kiki , please hurry !
i know it was here , so it's gotta be around somplace .
there it is !
excuse me , anybody home?
can you please help me?
anybody?
anybody here?
yeah !
i can't come down right now .
but why don't you come up?
what do you want?
that stuffed black cat you put behind your window?
i'm sorry , but its mine .
i dropped it .
be good , and don't move yet .
i found it in the forest .
would you give it back to me , please?
hang on a minute , i just can't stop just now .
nice , very nice .
you're beautiful just the way you are .
you really should have told me you were in a hurry .
i got sort of fond of it .
i'm sorry .
the stuffing is coming out !
i'd bet the crows did it .
they were making a big fuss over it .
what am i gonna do?
i can't deliver it like this .
say , how about we work out a deal?
that's pretty exciting .
and at 13 too !
to be completely independant .
that's great .
can you fix it?
trust me .
ketto !
ketto !
time for your bath .
the guests will be here soon !
ketto !
i'm done !
thank you so much !
you'd better help jiji before it's too late !
but i haven't finished yet .
you've done enough .
go help him !
thanks !
jeff likes my present more than me !
it is strange you know .
he adores that stuffed cat .
he won't leave it alone .
he thinks its a puppy?
your sister is not going to be happy to hear that .
thats okay .
i gave it to jeff anyway .
remember to tell auntie " thank you " .
you should be nice to him .
jeff is a very old dog .
but grandma , all he does is sleep !
ketto , go open the door .
jeff wants to go out .
be sure to push the door shut when you finished .
jiji !
what took you so long?
i'm sorry .
that marvelous dog helped me escape .
he said he'd be happy to help us out if he could .
would you take this back in?
whats the matter?
i'm famished .
yeah , me too .
and i'm tired too .
but it sure was a wonderful adventure .
and that painter ... who found the stuffed cat wants to do a drawing with me in it .
naked?
don't be silly .
kiki's flying delivery sevice
boring ...
what are you doing?
you are supposed to be minding this shop .
i am .

i know . but that's not what i mean .
i mean my customers .
jiji , if nobody comes , i'll have to eat pancakes forever ... and be fat , fat , fat .
so what am i supposed to do?
i think pancakes are great , providing they're not burned of course .
you're no help .
