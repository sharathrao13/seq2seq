23 . 976
the future has not been written .
there is no fate but what we make for ourselves .
i wish i could believe that .
my name is john connor .
they tried to murder me before i was born .
when i was 13 , they tried again .
machines from the future .
terminators .
all my life , my mother told me the storm was coming .
" judgment day .
connor !
the beginning of a war between man and machines .
three billion lives would vanish in an instant .
and i would lead what was left of the human race to ultimate victory .
it hasn 't happened .
no bombs fell .
computers didn 't take control .
we stopped judgment day .
i should feel safe ... ... but i don 't .
so i live off the grid .
no phone , no address .
no one and nothing can find me .
i've erased all connections to the past .
but as hard as i try ... ...
i can 't erase my dreams ... ... my nightmares .
i feel the weight of the future bearing down on me .
a future i don 't want .
so i keep running ... ... as fast as i can .
anywhere .
nowhere .
oh , my god .
are you okay?
do you want me to call 911?
i like this car .
what are you ...?
you , in the silver lexus .
slow down .
slow down and pull over immediately .
lady , have you any idea how fast you were going?
let me see your license and registration .
i like your gun .
what?
this stupid thing's not working .
what's wrong with this thing?
i hate machines .
hello?
" kate , it's your father .
you're blowing me off again .
i'm so sorry .
you know how much i wanted to see you this weekend .
" but we're having computer problems " ...
i know , you can't talk about it .
it's just ... ... scott was really looking forward to this .
katie .
i wish i had more time to get to know him .
i really do .
that's okay .
you're bound to run into him at the wedding .
please .
i'm still in a state of denial about that .
you're not the only one .
" hey , kiddo .
you don't need me to pass judgment on this guy .
you've done the right thing your whole life .
you won 't make a mistake .
you never do .
i'm the luckiest father in the world , you know?
i've never had to be afraid for my daughter .
listen , i hate this .
i gotta run .
come see me .
i promise i won 't cancel .
we will .
" bye , dad , i love you .
love you too .
okay , what have we got?
this new computer virus is tricky .
it's infected half the civilian internet as well as secondary military apps .
payroll , inventory .
primary defense nets are still clean?
so far the firewalls are holding up .
sir , the pentagon has proposed we use our al to scan the infrastructure .
search and destroy for any hint of the virus .
i know , tony , but that's like going after a fly with a bazooka .
once the connection's made , it should only be a few minutes .
during which we've put everything under the control of a single computer system .
the most intelligent system ever conceived .
i still prefer to keep humans in the loop .
i'm not sure skynet's ready .
yes , sir .
thanks .
you're supposed to go around to the back .
hey , i said you're supposed to go ...
take off your clothes .
patience , honey .
bitch .
wait your turn .
your clothes .
talk to the hand .
now .
welcome to jim 's burgers .
can i take your order?
jose barrera?
" yeah , that's me .
growing concern over widespread outages in the global digital network ... ... have prompted rumors of a new computer super virus .
" wall street analysts are confident ...
shit !
my mom's home .
here .
hide the beer .
hide the beer .
here .
take that .
go , go , go .
elizabeth and william anderson?
i'm bill .
my sister's upstairs .

what's going on?
i have to go to the clinic .
it's an emergency .
it's 4 : 30 in the morning .
well , i'll be back before you get up .
cool it , guys , it's just me .
we've got a sick cat coming in .
great .
junkies .
please , don't do that .
i suppose it was you who ripped us off last week .
put the phone down .
sorry .
i just ...
i needed some medicine .
there's an emergency clinic half a mile away .
can't do that .
how much did you take?
enough .
well ... ... this is the stuff we use to chemically neuter dogs .
take a look .
hey !
jesus !
you didn't have to do that !
next time bring a clue , not a paintball gun .
no , this isn't what you think .
yeah , right .
it's hercules .
i think he's got pneumonia .
he started coughing and wouldn't stop .
betsy , i've got a problem in the back .
a problem?
this is an emergency !
it sounds like a hairball .
i know what a hairball sounds like .
where's dr. monroe?
it's 5 : 30 in the morning .
i'm sure he's home sleeping .
he'll come in if he has to .
just wait in here with hercules and i'll be a few minutes , all right?
mike kripke's basement .

you're john connor .
i'm kate brewster .
we went to west hills junior high together .
jesus .

middle of eighth grade , you just disappeared .
and there was that thing about your foster parents .
yeah , they were murdered .
i didn't do it .

katherine brewster?

yes .
he's ... ... in the kennel , in a cage .
you said that you'd let me go .
i lied .

you have to let me go !
john connor .

no .
you must live .
why are you here?
where are we going?

this guy weighs a ton .
" 911 " .
yes .
yes .
i'm being kidnapped .
" where are you now?
i don't know where .
i'm in my truck .
it's a toyota tundra .
it says " emery animal hospital " on the side .
i'm locked inside the back .
hello?
hello?
shit !
shit !
get off .
let me out !
what are you doing here?
you tell me .
you got me into this .
stop the car .
i can't .
not yet .
you bastard !

son of a bitch .
goddamn it .
look what you did to my car .
this is my company car , asshole .

what are you doing?
if you don't have insurance , i'm gonna rip your balls off .
i don't want any problems , okay?

who's talking back there?
what's going on?
calm down .
shut up !
" i'm being kidnapped !

" call 911 !

you have to pull over !
yeah , first chance i get .
hold on !

i'll drive .
get out .
excuse me .
move over .
no sign of brain trauma .
yeah , i'm fine , thanks .
do you even remember me?
sarah connor?
blowing up cyberdyne?
hasta la vista , " baby .
ring any bells?
that was a different t 101 .
what , do you come off an assembly line or something?
exactly .
oh , man .
i'm gonna have to teach you everything all over again .
katherine brewster , have you sustained injury?
drop dead , you asshole !
i'm unable to comply .
where are you taking me?
to a safe location .
all right , get off at the next exit .
let her out .
negative .
katherine brewster must be protected .
i thought i was the one they were after .
you could not be located .
so a t x was sent back through time to eliminate your lieutenants .
so she's gonna be in the resistance?
no , no .
no , you shouldn't even exist .
i mean , we took out cyberdyne over 10 years ago .
we stopped judgment day .
you only postponed it .
judgment day is inevitable .
i require a cutting tool .
here , take the wheel .
what are you doing?
i am powered by two hydrogen fuel cells .
my primary cell was damaged by a plasma attack .
t x is designed for extreme combat , driven by a plasma reactor ... ... and equipped with onboard weapons .
its arsenal includes ... ... nanotechnological transjectors .
meaning?
it can control other machines .
its body chassis is heavily armored and hardened to withstand external attack .
you'll find a way to destroy her .
unlikely .
i'm an obsolete design .
t x is faster , more powerful and more intelligent .
it's a far more effective killing machine .
oh , great .
that's great .
my presence in this timeline has been anticipated .
t x is designed to terminate other cybernetic organisms .
so she's an anti terminator terminator?
you've gotta be shitting me .
no , i am not shitting you .
when ruptured , the fuel cells become unstable .
relax .
let me out of here !
relax !
man , this is wack .
it's been like this for hours .
every goddamn station .
hey .
hey !
are you gonna pay for that?
talk to the hand .
help !
help me !
help !
i think we better go .
jerky?
you're kidnapping me .
look ...
god , you were always a delinquent .
and look at you now , sitting there like the bad boy thing still works .
what are you , some kind of gang member?
how do you live with yourself?
what?
tell her who i am .
john connor is leader of the worldwide resistance and last hope of humankind .
right .
and him?
he's a robot from the future .
living tissue over a metal skeleton , sent back in time to protect me .
go to hell .
he doesn't mean you any harm .
i have a fianc .
he's gonna be looking for me .
what is it that you want?
just ... ... imagine ... ... if you knew you were gonna do something important with your life .
something amazing .
maybe the most important thing anyone has ever done .
but there's a catch .
something terrible has to happen .
you couldn't ... ... live with yourself if you didn't try to stop it , but ...
what are you talking about?
it's just ...
the life you know ... ... all the stuff that you take for granted ... ... it's not gonna last .
mike kripke .
back there , why did you say " kripke's basement "?
because mike kripke's house ... ... that's where the kids used to go make out , right?
so you and me ...
wait , did we ...?
holy shit , we did .
we made out in kripke's basement .
i cannot believe you remembered that .
i must have made some kind of impression .
give me a break .
i only remembered because the next day you were in the news .
wait a second .
you and me hooked up the day before i first met him .
and now again , 10 years later .
we were supposed to meet .
coincidence .
yeah .
hon?
did you just get in?
hi , i'm detective edwards , l. a. p. d. this is detective bell .
we're looking for katherine brewster .
is she here?
no .
you're her fianc , scott mason?
yes .
there was an incident at the veterinary hospital where she works .
we're concerned something may have happened to her .
where is she?
we got a report from a gas station attendant near victorville ... ... about a possible kidnapping and it might be related .
i'll help you find her .
come with me .
go .
your mother?
i never even knew where she was buried .
i hit the road the day she died .
why did you bring me here?
no !
what are you doing?
hey , stop !
get away from it !
stop !
sarah connor was cremated in mexico .
her friends scattered her ashes in the sea .
they stored these weapons in accordance with her will .
what happened to her?
leukemia .
i'm sorry .
we were living in baja when she was diagnosed .
they only gave her six months .
but she fought for three years .
long enough to make sure .
to make sure?
that the world didn't end .
every day after this one is a gift .
she told me , " we made it .
we're free .
but i never really believed that .
i guess she didn't either .
you know you were about the closest thing to a father i ever had?
how pathetic is that?
out of my way !
my mission is to protect you .
that's enough .
move or i'll do it !
i swear i will !
i'll shoot you !
go ahead .
see what happens .
don't do that .
oh , my god .
this is the police .
we have the building surrounded .
release your hostage !
just leave me here .
i'm not the one you want .
you're wasting your time .
incorrect .
john connor leads the resistance to victory .
how?
why?
why me?
you are john connor .
christ , my mom fed me that bullshit since the cradle .
look at me .
i'm no leader , i never was !
i'm never gonna ...
let go .
you're right .
you're not the one i want .
i'm wasting my time .
fuck you , you fucking machine !
better .
oh , you were just dicking with me?
anger is more useful than despair .
what?
basic psychology is among my subroutines .
perps still holed up?
gotcha .
good news .
your fiance's okay .
where is she?
greenlawn cemetery , up off the 5 freeway .
it's right by the desert .
but they're gonna bring her back to the ...
oh , my god !
oh , my dear jesus !
god !
you're safe now .
they can't hurt you .
kate , my name is dr. silberman .
i'm a post trauma counselor for the sheriff's department .
how are you feeling?
he's not human .
he's really not human .
i know what it's like to be in a hostage situation .
i've been there myself .
the fear , the adrenaline .
you find yourself imagining things .
impossible things .
crazy things .
insane things .
take years to get over it .
go , go , go !
move it !
drop your weapon !
and the coffin !
take him down !
take him down !
resume fire !
we must reacquire katherine brewster .
why?
what makes her so goddamn important?
through her , you contact remnants of the military and learn how to fight skynet ... ... forming the core of the resistance .
later , your children will become important .
what?
she's your wife .
get in !
do you want to live?
come on !
it was scott !
how could it be scott?
your fianc?
the t x is polymimetic , able to take the form of anything it touches .
your fianc is dead .
