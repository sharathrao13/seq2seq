right .
that's tuesday dealt with .
let's look at wednesday now .
uh ...
half seven mass .
i can take that .
and , uh ... maybe ...
could you take the eight o'clock at all??
right , i can take that as well .
now , um ... the half six evening mass on sunday .
evening mass?
too early .
no problem , i can take that as well , i'll just make a note .
morning , ted .
morning , dougal .
uh , dougal??
there's , uh ...
there's some shaving cream just there .
no , there's not , ted .
you're grand .
no , on you .
oh , where , exactly?
just there , below your ear .
here?
yes , and there's a bit more ...
gone?
no , there's still just a ...
it's all over the place .
oh , god .
how on earth did all that get there?
i didn't even shave this morning .
so , what are we doing today , ted?
confessions and things like that?
yes , dougal , things like that .
it's great being a priest , isn't it , ted?
god , it's lovely out .
oh , wait till i tell you , ted !
funland's coming to craggy island on saturday .
oh , yes , the fairground thing .
i wouldn't have much interest in that type of thing myself .
they've got a spider baby .
a what?
a spider baby .
a freak show thing .
it's got the body of a spider but it's actually a baby .
oh .
how is it a baby?
does it have a nappy on or something?
no .
does it have the head of a baby?
um ...
no .
well , if it looks like a spider and it doesn't gurgle or anything , how do you know it's a baby?
they keep it in a pram .
dougal , are you absolutely sure about this?
you're not confusing it with a dream or anything?
no , honestly , i saw it on the news .
honestly !
oh ...
oh , wait now .
actually , now that you say it , it was a dream , yeah .
have you been studying this like i told you?
oh , i have , ted .
sorry .
but we should go anyway , ted , it'll be great !
last year i did horse riding and it was just fantastic .
i didn't know you rode horses .
well , it wasn't a real horse , ted , like ...
it was this old fellow with a saddle on him .
god , he must've been about 80 .
of course , he couldn't go very fast .
i was kind of lashing him with the whip and all ...
couldn't get much of a response .
and how long were you up on him?
oh , i'd say it was about , uh ... about an hour?
so you were up on an 80 year old man , riding him around and whipping him for 60 minutes?
you realise that image will stay with me for the rest of my life?
i know , ted .
it's great , isn't it?
come on , we should go .
no , i don't think i could take the excitement , to be honest .
suppose i'll just see if there's anything on the tv .
'what type of a jumper is that? '
'well , basically ... '
ahh !
maybe i'll just go and study the old diagram .
hello?
father ted crilly speaking .
hello , father .
sorry to disturb you .
my name is terry macnamee .
i'm producing faith of our fathers for telly eireann .
we're talking to priests who work in isolated communities .
would you be interested?
well , that's very , um ...
that's very exciting .
faith of our fathers is my favourite programme .
well , you were the first person we thought of .
if you are interested , i could come over .
we'd give you a small fee .
who's that , ted?
uh , no one .
no one?
'hello , father crilly? '
no .
must be someone , ted .
just a moment .
sorry .
how exactly do you get to craggy island?
it doesn't seem to be on any maps .
no , it wouldn't be on any maps , now .
we're not exactly new york .
the best way is from galway , go slightly north till you see the english boats with the nuclear symbol .
they go very close to the island dumping the old glow in the dark .
are there any other priests living with you?
we don't list anyone else .
um ... well , uh ...
no , there's no one else here .
i'll see you on saturday .
i'll call when i get there .
bye .
the ants are back , ted .
never turn on the tv when father jack's asleep .
you know how he is !
but he's always asleep .
anyone who's served the church as long as he has deserves a rest .
it's an honour for us to look after him in his old age .
look at him , dreaming of past glories , no doubt .
girls , pay attention .
we've got a special treat today .
father hackett has volunteered to take you all for volleyball practice .
right , father .
he's just reminded me it's very warm , so no need for your tracksuit tops .
hello !
father dougal mcguire here .
and welcome to this week's top of the pops .
in at number 45 this week is father ted crilly with i've got the power .
and at number 15 for the 16th week in a row is father jack hackett , with i'm a sleepy priest .
how did that gobshite get on the television? !
hello to you all .
ah , is the television broken again , father?
yes , we ...
there's nothing wrong with it that can't be fixed with a bit of you know what in the head department .
now , then , who's for tea?
me , please , mrs doyle .
tea?
feck !
i'm fine , mrs doyle .
you won't have a cup?
no thanks , mrs doyle .
i won't have a cup .
you sure?
it's hot .
no , i'm not in the mood .
all right , so ...
aw , would you not have a drop?
no , thanks .
just a little cup .
i'm fine !
i tell you what , father ...
seriously !
i'll pour a cup anyway .
and you can have it if you want .
now ...
and what do you say to a cup?
feck off , cup !
he loves his cup of tea .
feck off !
there you go .
feck off !
father crilly , i nearly forgot .
earlier , a terry macnamee called .
oh , right .
who's that?
never heard of him .
something to do with the television?
he's coming to fix it .
he'll be here tomorrow at 12 .
grand .
yeah , it's good you called someone , ted .
it's still not working .
# you're simply the best
# doo doo doo doo
# better than all the rest , doo doo doo doo #
ahem .
you frightened the life out of me .
you're doing the old pop star thing .
i was , ted , yeah .
it was great being on tv today .
i've caught the telly bug .
well ...
get to bed now and get some sleep , you don't want to get over tired .
did you ever want to get into television?
ah , no , i ...
i wouldn't be interested in that kind of thing , really .
right .
you wouldn't be much good at it , actually .
what?
why not?
well , you're a bit serious .
and your eyes are a bit crossed .
they're a bit wonky .
the cameras notice .
i am not cross eyed , dougal .
ah , you're a bit , now , ted .
half the time i don't know if you're talking to me or father jack .
dougal , why don't you just ... get some sleep .
right .
just have to say the old prayers .
our father , who art in heaven ...
hallowed .
hallowed be thy ...
name .
ah , papa don't preach ...
dougal , you know you can praise god with sleep .
can you , ted?
yes , it's a way of thanking him for a tiring day .
god .
there's lots of ways to praise god , isn't there , ted?
like that time you told me to praise him by just leaving the room .
that was a good one , yes .
ted ...
mmm?
ted?
yes?
knock knock .
who's there?
father dougal mcguire .
good night , dougal .
i can hear you a bit better now , shh , yeah .
you made it , then?
i think so .
there's no indication it is craggy island .
there's no signs or anything .
is there a man looking at you with a t shirt saying " i shot jr "?
actually , there is .
ah , you're here , so , yeah .
what?
the line is bad , you're a bit muffled .
i'm on a portable phone , you caught me by surprise .
i'm on the toilet .
right .
so , er ...
so where can we meet?
anywhere we can get a few good shots?
any local landmarks?
no .
what?
there are no landmarks here now .
none at all??
no , the island itself is a kind of landmark .
for ships and that .
head away from it and you're going in the right direction .
so , uh ...
there's the field .
oh , a field .
well , that sounds ...
it's not a field , really , but it has less rocks than most places .
never mind .
i'll meet you at the field .
how do i get there?
ask tom there .
he'll help you out .
right , father .
thanks .
bird !
ooooo .
holy mary mother of god !
god , ted , i'm so sorry .
it was just a joke .
tr ... try to avoid doing that again , dougal .
i thought it was really ... herself .
that's the last thing i need .
you're right there , ted .
anyway , it's time for jack's walk .
time for your walk , father jack !
off around the cliffs .
can i bring him to funland , ted?
he'd love that .
no , he wouldn't .
take him around the cliffs .
this time , near the edge , put on the brakes .
he was lucky the last time .
right , ted .
um , you're not coming yourself?
ah , no , i think i'll stay here and pray for a while .
oh , ho , what are you after , ted?
i'm not after anything , dougal .
it's not unknown for members of the clergy to pray from time to time .
here we are , father crilly .
get away !
there's nothing father hackett likes more than some fresh air !
come on .
oh , yeah .
that's it .
yeah , yeah , no ...
ahh !
come on , father .
oh , now , come on , father hackett .
that's it , now , in you go .
isn't that better?
good man .
this'll keep you nice and warm .
are you all right?
ooh .
bye , then !
every single day the same thing .
once he's out , he has a great time .
he loves them old cliffs .
i'll be off .
what are you up to?
i'll just have a bit of a pray .
all right .
enjoy the rest of the weekend .
'patrons are reminded that parking is unavailable .
'a reminder of the unavailability of parking facilities . '
i didn't know this bloody thing was on here .
hello , father .
hello , tom .
telly eireann lads get here all right?
they've gone to film a bit of the island first .
they'll be back soon .
i'll wait in the field .
father !
yes , tom?
i've killed a man .
did you?
we'll talk later , i'm doing an interview for television .
'a little boy has been lost .
thank you . '
keep your hands on the sides !
'the child has now been found , thank you . '
you fat , smelly cow !
take this .
you have a face like a pair of tits .
well , at least that's one pair between us !
hello , mary .
ah , hello , father .
hello , john .
pack of toffos , father?
no , thanks .
i have to meet someone .
i'm to be interviewed for television .
oh .
really?
that's fantastic .
you know , father , i think you'd be brilliant on television .
well , thank you .
you'll be more than a match for gay byrne or terry wogan or any of them .
it'll take weeks to get to their level .
but i have to go find this film unit .
they probably want to do a few close ups and master shots and that .
don't want to be late and get a reputation as a marilyn monroe type .
see you soon .
good luck , father ted .
get them fecking crunchies out .
feck off .
ted !
ted !
over here , ted !
come here and look at me !
hey , ted !
what are you doing here?
i thought you weren't interested in this type of thing .
you're supposed to be taking jack for his walk .
well , um ...
the cliffs were closed for the day .
how could cliffs be closed , dougal??
ok , no .
it wasn't that .
they were gone .
ah .
the cliffs were gone?
how could they just disappear?
erosion .
come off and to the cliffs with you !
there's just another couple of turns to go .
woooo !
'patrons are reminded to keep their hands visible at all times
'when not availing on the funfair rides . '
go straight home , do you hear?
no more nonsense !
everyone else is here .
dougal , you're a priest , show some decorum .
wish i wasn't a priest .
what?
i wish i wasn't a priest .
jack heard you say that !
he told me he doesn't believe in god .
dougal !
ted !
can i have a go on the crane of death , ted?
the what?
the crane of death .
there was a young fellow killed on it last year .
look .
i'm sick and tired of your ...
ted , a fortune teller !
we'll have one go .
don't waste your money .
there might be something in it .
it's rubbish .
how could anybody believe it?
it's no more peculiar than that stuff in seminary , heaven and hell and everlasting life and that .
you're not meant to take it seriously .
you are so too meant to take it seriously !
are you?
yes !
heaven , hell and everlasting life?
of course !
look , dougal , if i let you go in , will you go home after?
i will , i promise , ted .
all right .
hello .
let's go , ted .
what's wrong?
i'm scared .
i'll do it and you can watch .
hello there !
sit !
first , cross my palm with silver .
silver?
i don't carry bags of it around .
give me a pound .
now , i'll interpret one card at a time , please .
be careful .
um ... i wasn't concentrating .
perhaps i could pick another?
no , this is a common misunderstanding .
the grim reaper doesn't mean death in a literal sense .
rather , it may mean the death of an old way of life and the beginning of a new one !
i know what that is .
it's probably about a new bicycle lamp .
another card , please .
is that good?
well , ah ...
it will all become clear at the next card .
this is really weird .
there's only supposed to be one in each pack .
hello , tom .
is father crilly around yet?
he is , yeah .
he's in there .
that's a nasty scar you've got , tom .
where did you get that?
i was , uh ... in an argument .
oh , i hope you won .
i certainly did .
that's nothing .
i've had worse than that .
can you believe me own dad did that to me?
it looks like a face !
'siobhan to the refreshment tent . '
where's father jack?
it's nearly five , time for his drink .
you go that way , i'll go this way .
ok .
'siobhan , please report to reheat the hamburgers . '
come , now , father , we'd better be off .
come on .
father !
father !
there you are , father .
we got here at last .
father , father .
dead to the world .
you don't know what's going on .
gin !
vodka !
it's time for your drink , come on !
ahhh !
are you lads from ... from the television?
well , yes .
oh , yes .
we'll just ask a few questions .
am i gonna be on the telly?
well , yes .
we'll start with a history of the island , then move on to how life has changed for the islanders ...
father , how would you say religious beliefs on the island have been affected by tv and greater access to the media?
god , no , they're talking to dougal .
think , ted .
drink !
drink !
there i am !
it's me , look !
i'm on the telly !
'so , god , does he really exist?
i mean , who knows?
'i don't know .
personally , i don't even believe in organised religion . '
i know , it's great , isn't it?
'a spider baby .
'it's got the body of a spider but the mind of a baby and ... '
'it wouldn't really bite you , unless it got a bit older . '
i can't believe it either , i'm on the television !
that gobshite again !
is he never off the air !
'a child has been , eh , lodged in the tunnel of goats .
'if we could have a nurse , please , to the tunnel of goats , thank you .
'a goat and a child have now become lodged together , eh ,
'and a nurse has become involved in the ... in the incident .
'another nurse is required to release the nurse we asked for previously .
'thank you . '
