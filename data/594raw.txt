she's hurt .
she's hurt .
you are not welcome here .
no .
she's hurt .
go away from us .
you are not welcome .
go away from us .
stop .
the soldier did not come to fight .
he is going away and we wiii iet him .
i am in agreement with kicking bird .
we wiii go down and talk to the white man .
and find out why he is here .
if this councii decides to talk to the white man ... ... then it wiii be so .
but in my mind it's not right ... ... that a chief as great as ten bears ... ... goes to ask the business of a puny , trespassing white man ... ... who has only a smart horse and a few white man's clothes .
i wiii not go .
you wiii go .
and you wiii go .
that is aii i have to say .
welcome .
welcome .
hi !
come .
please , sit down .
sit down .
wait just a ....
just a minute .
his mind is gone .
tatanka .
buffalo .
buffalo .
tatanka .
buffalo .
tatanka .
the fierce one , as i call him , seems a very tough fellow .
i hope i never have to fight him .
from the little i know , he seems to be honest and very direct .
i like the quiet one immensely .
he's been patient and inquisitive .
he seems eager to communicate .
i would conclude that he is a man of some weight among his people .
buffalo .
i believe i made an even greater impression on their next visit .
i produced a coffee grinder , something none of them had seen before .
is the coffee not good?
it's too strong , maybe .
sugar .
put in .
taste it .
sugar .
you want some?
you want some?
that's a iot .
okay .
yeah .
it's good to finally have some company .
s o much goes unsaid and i have the feeling that these people ...
... the quiet one in particular , want something from me .
made presents of coffee and most of the sugar .
it didn't figure to last anyway .
don't believe i go too far in saying ...
... that a foundation for good relations is being laid .
stands with a fist .
we wiii talk awhile .
your wounds are healing weil?
yes , they are .
you are happy here , with my family?
i am glad to be here .
i am missing my husband .
perhaps you wiii marry again when the time is right?
perhaps .
we have word from many places that the whites are coming .
they are coming into everyone's country .
i think they wiii soon be in ours .
this white man who iives at the old soldier fort ....
i have visited him and i believe his heart is a good one .
i am afraid of the white man at the fort .
i am afraid he wiii teii others that i am here .
i am afraid they wiii try to take me away .
i've heard they take people away .
every warrior in camp would fight them if they tried .
i cannot make the white man ianguage .
he cannot speak sioux .
it has been a iong time since i made the talk .
i want you to try .
i don't know how .
yes , you do .
i can't .
i can't .
it's dead in me .
i don't ask this for myself .
i ask this for aii the people .
he knows things about the whites which we do not .
now , you must remember .
i can't .
wiii she make the white words?
she won't try .
she is being difficult .
weil , she's the one who's crying .
perhaps the difficulty is yours .
christine !
get 'em , joe !
get them chickens !
biily , you get away from those puppies !
damn !
get the kids , and get them in the house .
go on !
christine !
christine !

i'm up here , mother .
get down now .
why?
just do it .
stay right where you are .
get back .
do you hear me?
joe , get in the house right now !
wiilie !
who is it , wiilie?
they iook iike pawnee .
my father and your father are talking to them .
what do they want?
i don't know .
go on .
you heard him .
get out of here .
run , christine !
i said run !
joe !
christine !
mommy !
come on , two socks .
bacon .
two s ocks , like cisco , has become a trusted friend .
he still won't eat from my hand ...
... but his keen eyes and ears never fail to alert me when something is wrong .
tatanka .
no .
no , i haven't seen any buffalo .
sorry .
are you hungry?
are you hungry?
i have food .
i have a iot of food .
nothing i've been told about these people is correct .
they are not beggars and thieves .
they are not the bogeymen they've been made out to be .
on the contrary , they are polite guests and have a familiar humor i enjoy .
real communication is slow , however ...
... and the quiet one is as frustrated as i am .
most of our progress has been built on the basis of failure ...
... rather than success .
i've thought to inquire if the woman i found lived or not ...
... but it seems far too complicated a subject , given our limitations .
one thing is clear , however .
there are no buffalo .
and it weighs heavy on their minds .
yesterday's meeting was the best yet .
it seems i've been invited to the village and i'm looking forward to going .
we were waiting for you .
we were waiting for you .
now teii him we are glad that he is here .
heilo .
you ....
here ....
good .
thank you .
i feei good .
i feei good .
ask him why he is at the soldier fort .
the soldier fort .
wait .
what is your names?
our names?
what is his name?
he's right .
introductions should come first .
he ....
he ....
kick .
kick?

more kick?
more kicking?

bird , kicking bird .
kicking bird .
what is he ....
is he chief?
no .
a holy man .

i'm john dunbar .
john dunbar .
dumb bear .
no , not dumb bear .
dunbar .
dun ....
bar .
not dumb bear .
dunbar .
there's been an exciting breakthrough with the indians .
the woman i found on the prairie speaks english ...
... and today , clear progress was made .
s he is white , and though i cannot be sure how she came to be with these people ...
... i can tell she is not a captive .
while i'm not afraid ...
... i don't feel completely welcome by everyone in the village .
my being here must be kicking bird's idea .
he is very enthusiastic and like two children ...
... we are both anxious to know more about each other .
but i find myself holding back .
for some reason , i am reluctant to answer all his questions .
maybe it's my sense of duty ...
... but something tells me not to say too much .
it was good to see fort s edgewick again ...
... and yet i look forward to another visit with my new neighbors .
this is still my home , however ...
... and i remain watchful for my relief and can only hope ...
... that my negotiations with the wild people of the plains will bear fruit .
buffalo !
buffalo !
i've seen buffalo !
buffaloes !
tatanka .
tatanka?
yeah .
riders were sent out to pick up the trail .
in the time it took to gather my things at s edgewick ...
... the entire tribe was well on its way .
their efficiency and speed with which they moved ...
... was enough to impress any military commander .
s pirits are high , and overnight i've gone from a person of suspicion ...
... to one of genuine standing .
i am greeted with open smiles and looks of appreciation .
in short , i have become a celebrity .
loo ten tant !
loo ten tant !
loo ten tant !
s couts picked up the trail exactly where i said it would be .
it was not hard to find ...
... a gigantic swath of torn up ground extending to the horizon .
the numbers it took to create this impossible image ...
... was hard to imagine .
loo ten tant !
loo ten tant !
who would do such a thing?
the field was proof enough ...
... that it was a people without value and without soul .
with no regard for s ioux rights .
the wagon tracks leading away left little doubt ...
... and my heart sank , as i knew it could only be white hunters .
voices that had been joyous all morning ...
... were now as silent as the dead buffalo left to rot in this valley ...
... killed only for their tongues and the price of their hides .
loo ten tant .
it was suddenly clear now what had happened ...
... and my heart sank as i tried to convince myself ...
... that the white men who'd been killed were bad people and deserved to die .
but it was no use .
i tried to believe that wind in his hair and kicking bird ...
... and the others who shared in the killing were not so happy for having done it .
but they were .
as i looked at familiar faces , i realized that the gap between us ...
... was greater than i could ever have imagined .
as they celebrated into the night the coming hunt ...
... it was hard to know where to be .
i don't know if they understood , but i could not sleep among them .
there had been no looks , and there was no blame .
there was only the confusion of a people not able to predict a future .
are you aii right?
i can't .
no , i'm fuil .
i'm fuil , and i can't teii the story anymore .
no .
you want to try it?
you want to try it?
here .
i can't .
this is too much .
good trade .
this is a good trade .
no , no , i can't .
i'm fuil , i'm tired .
no !
loo ten tant !
loo ten tant !
tatanka .
big tatanka .
big tatanka .
that's my hat !
you're wearing my hat .
it's my hat .
i found it on the prairie .
it's mine .
no , you ....
my hat .
that hat belongs to the lieutenant .
he ieft it on the prairie .
he didn't want it .
weil , you can see he wants it now .
we aii know that it's a soldier's hat .
we aii know who wears it .
if you want to keep it , that's aii right .
but give something for it .
good trade .
there you are .
come here , cisco .
it seems every day ends with a miracle here .
and whatever god may be , i thank god for this day .
to stay any longer would have been useless .
we had all the meat we could possibly carry .
we had hunted for three days , losing a half a dozen ponies ...
... and only three men injured .
i'd never known a people so eager to laugh ...
... so devoted to family , so dedicated to each other .
and the only word that came to mind was 'harmony . '
many times i've felt alone ...
... but until this afternoon ...
... i'd never felt completely lonely .
made a long patrol today .
there's nothing to report .
time seems irrelevant except for the fact that i am bored ...
... and these hours alone are endless .
it is difficult for me to muster any enthusiasm ...
... for my regular duties here .
and the fort is showing serious signs of neglect .
the truth is , i am missing the company of my friends .
i can see all of their faces , but somehow it is not enough .
tomorrow i will pay them a visit .
it may be forward of me , but what can it hurt?
after all , they are my neighbors .
the night sounds have become so familiar as to be comforting .
my life on the prairie's a good one and for the most part , i am content .
the indians have a great pull for me that goes beyond curiosity .
there's something wise about them and i'm drawn to them ...
... in ways much stronger than my obligations to the military .
go home !
damn him .
god !
go home !
go !
go home , two socks !
bad wolf !
you were right .
he is a speciai white man .
he should have a reai name .
it is autumn now and i am spending more time than ever with my friends .
they have given me my own lodge and i feel comfortable there .
we talk every day , but i know kicking bird is frustrated with me .
he always wants to know how many more white people are coming .
i tell him they will most likely pass through this country and nothing more .
but i am speaking in half truths .
one day there will be too many , but i cannot bring myself to tell him that .
i am sure that s tands with a fist knows that i am holding back ...
... but to her credit , she says nothing .
a war party is going against the pawnee soon and i have asked to go .
i sense i made a mistake in doing so ...
... but i could not bring myself to take it back .
they are my friends , and from what little i gather ...
... the pawnee have been very hard on these people .
i hope i have not overstepped my bounds .
come in , please .
sit down?
kicking bird want to know ... ... why you want to make war on the pawnee .
they have done nothing to you .
they are sioux enemies .
only sioux warriors to go .
teii him that i have been a warrior ... ... ionger than many of the young men who wiii go on this war party .
teii him .
he said that the sioux way of being a warrior ... ... is not the white way .
you are not ready .
i know , i understand .
teii him i cannot iearn these ways in camp .
he also asks that you ... ... watch over his family while he is gone .
this thing he asks is a great honor for you .
teii him that i would be happy to watch over his family .
he thanks dances with wolves for coming .
who is dances with wolves?
it is the name which aii the people ... ... are cailing you now .
dances with ....
that's right .
that day .
dances with wolves .
how do you say it?
keep on with the white man talk if it pleases you .
i iike to make the talk .
i'm here .
we walk .
i cut this off .
i shaved it off .

he is a fast iearner .
what did you think i meant?

then iet us take you .
how did you get your name?
i was not very old ... ... when i came to be with the people .
and i was made to work .
i worked every day , very hard .
there was a woman ... ... who didn't iike me much .
she used to caii me bad names , and sometimes she ....
beat me?
and one day , she was ... ... cailing me these bad names ... ... with her face in my face ... ... and i hit her .
i was not very big , but she feii down .
she feii hard and didn't move .
and then i stood over her with my fist ... ... and i asked if ... ... there was any other woman ... ... who wanted to caii me bad names .
no one bothered me after that day .
no , i wouldn't think so .
show me .
show me where you hit her .
why are you not married?
i'm sorry .
i have to go .
i'm sorry .
can i help you?
you are not talking today?
no , i am not .
some of your words are wrong but you are iearning fast .
so what can i teii you today?
i want to know about stands with a fist .
why is there no man with her?
she is in mourning .
i don't ....
i do not understand " mourning .
she cries for someone .
cries for who?
it is not polite to speak of the dead .
but you are new , so i wiii teii you .
she cries for her husband .
he was kiiled not iong ago .
that is how you came to find her on the prairie .
how iong wiii she cry?
it is kicking bird's place to say when she is finished .
he's the one that found her when she was very iittle .
people are talking about you .
what are they saying?
they are proud of the medicine ... ... you are making with dances with wolves .
i have hurt him , and i should go talk to him .
you can't .
he is gone .
he ieft this morning .

i have many rifles .
at the fort?
yes .

i wiii take smiles a lot .
