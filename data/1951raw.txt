he lives in california .
i wish i was in california right now .
so , why did you want to become a photographer?
fish .
fish .
tropical fish , actually .
when i was a kid , i used to go to the library and pick out all the books ... ... with tropical fish , you know .
beautiful colors and shapes .
when i was eight years old , i realized someone had to take pictures of the fish .
and i wanted that to be me .
but i grew up and i realized that ... things don't have to be extraordinary to be beautiful .
the ordinary could be just as beautiful .
like what?
well ...
like you see the couple there?
look at the way the girl is holding on to him so tight .
but he can still drink his coffee .
it looks like she feels safe wrapped around him .
and if you believe that , i'll tell you another one .
take my picture .
i feel beautiful tonight .
bye .
bye .
okay .
hi .
hi .
ma'am?
i have your dry cleaning .

hey , you're not in china .
i didn't make it past o'hare .
what happened?
i found lisa .
whoa .
here it is .
this is the article she left behind .
the funeral's today .
i can't believe you're blowing off shanghai for this .
this isn't actually lisa .
this is a compact .
what about your woman?

you superstitious?
god , i am so stupid .
here , give it to me
no , no .
it's okay .
i'm sorry .
you're right .
this doesn't make any sense .
one minute i'm looking at rings , and the next i'm here , doing this .
whoa .
whoa , looking at rings?
i didn't realize you were that serious .
apparently , i'm not .
see , that's how the universe works .
the minute you make a decision you decide on anything along comes temptation .
what would you do?
keep them both and hope they didn't find out about each other is what i would do .
that's perfect .
asshole .
i have to find out why she left .
she got scared .
everyone gets scared .
no , not lisa .
she wouldn't have left without an explanation .
without some sort of letter or a call or something .
she's not like that .
something must've happened , and whatever it was
screwed you up big time .
i know she loved me .
so let me borrow your keys , okay?
why?
the funeral's today .
it's the only lead i've got .
oh ... my car .

yeah , he's full of shit , all right .
yeah .
i knew it .
he didn't lend me his car .
i took it .
i stole his keys .
that's good .
why would you do that?
because i'm a selfish idiot .
and i had this whole thing going on that ...
i don't wanna bore you with it .
please .
i insist .
okay .
well , um ...
i was looking for somebody .
a woman .

hello?
okay .
why don't i just i'll pick you up at the theater .
i think not so , my lord .
dear lad , believe it , for they shall yet belie thy happy years to say thou art a man .
prosper well in this , and thou shalt live as freely as thy lord to call his fortunes thine .
i'll do my best to woo your lady ... ... and yet a barful strife .
whoe'er i woo , myself would be his wife .
alex , what's going on?
what do you mean?
well , i'm sitting in the audience and i'm getting nothing .
i figured maybe i'm missing something , so i come , i take a closer look .
but you know what?
i'm still not buying it .
what the hell's the matter with you today?
look , the line , " whoe'er i woo , myself would be his wife " defines your character .
you're in love with this guy , and he is asking you to help him get another woman !
you're upset , you're confused , it's tearing you up inside !
we've gotta see the love , but we've also gotta see the agony .
you have been in love before , haven't you?
yes .
sure .
oh , good .
well , please , share a little something with us , huh?
god . you sound so close .
can't believe you're 7 . 000 miles away .
