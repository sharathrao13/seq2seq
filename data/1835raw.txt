i love you .
five people have been killed by an avalanche in france .
everyone on our trip has tried it thousands of times .
i just don't see what's so funny about dangling off rock faces .
of course it'll be great for me to be widowed at 25 .
there are also dangers to being a cook .
yes .
lots .
you're always burning your fingers .
and what about all those big knives?
i worry about those every time you leave for work .

it's an extra prezzie to help you look good while i'm away .
the box does open ...
wow !

no , of course not .
the problem is , i've just got to see them on you .
you can change them if it's too big .
the shop assistant was a man so i couldn't say you were " about his size " .
it's ridiculous , anyway .
a man in the lingerie department .
what on earth does he tell his kids?
cille ...
let me have a look at you !
no !
know what?
i don't think they're very nice after all .
we'd better take them off .
nice of you to buy me a car .
but you borrow it the whole time .

stine?

does anybody have a mobile phone to call an ambulance with?
you didn't bring it?
ok .
i've got to calm down .
i'll go and get a doctor .
does anybody have a mobile phone?
when it's my birthday can i have a horse?
no .
horses are for girls .
you're a boy .
you want something motorized .
maybe i'm gay .
no , you're not .
not at the age of eight .
what if i am?
you'll just have to wait to come out of the closet till you're 12 .
all right?
yes .
good .
will i get a horse then?
you'll get a horse .
where are your glasses?
ln the lounge .
where in the lounge?
on a chair .
on a chair?

go and get them before somebody sits on them .
do you want a horse?
no .
sure?
shall i tickle you a bit?
give me your hand .
i need a hand .
here comes the surgeon to cut off your hand ...
hi ... they've only just paged me .
are you ok?
she's just had a fright .
yes .
niels , i have done an xray .
thanks .
where is stine?
she's ok .
she's fine .
she wasn't sure she wanted to celebrate this evening .
don't worry .
i'll see what we can do .
marie ... what happened?
i didn't see it .
i only heard the bump .
it wasn't your fault , marie .
you do know that , don't you?
yes .
that's what the police said , too .
but i didn't tell them we were going a bit too fast because me and stine were arguing .
that's not why it happened .
i only heard him .
i didn't see him .
you couldn't help it .
will you find out how he is?
i'll run you home first .
no , i want to know how he is .
i'm afraid it's really bad .
really bad .
we don't know for sure .
but it looks really serious .
his girlfriend is sitting in the hall .
yes ... er ... yes .
hello .
hello .
have you time to talk to me?
just for a moment?
ls he dead?
no , i'm just ...
sorry .
i'm not on duty .
ok .
clumsy of me .
sorry .
my wife was driving the car .
your wife?
yes .
ok ...
so that must have been your daughter?
yes ... she'll be all right , too .
it's her birthday .
we're getting married .
you will .
you think?
yes .
i'm sure of it .
we're so terribly sorry this has happened .
lf there's anything we can do to help ...
ls there anybody at home?
i don't have any parents , and joachim's live in the usa .
look ...
that's me , and that's our phone number .
call whenever you feel like it .
can you ask how bad it is?
they won't tell me .
i don't know anything .
that's because they don't know anything yet either .
but they would tell me , wouldn't they? lf they thought ...
they would tell me?
yes , definitely .
yes .
with lovely hot chocolate and birthday cake ...
and when she ...
happy birthday , darling !
did you hear that torben's walked out on birthe and their ugly kids?
when was that?
beats me why he stayed so long .
she looked like henry vill .
she even dressed like him .
you're talking about our friends .
she could have made an effort .
a manicure or the occasional bike ride . ls the sauce all gone?
i'll get you some more .
are you ok?
he just had so much blood in him .
was the car damaged?
finn !
it's a fair question .
a new car ...
are you sure?
yes .
what did she say to you?
she didn't say anything .
she was afraid and upset .
she asked how you were and also how mum was .
it's a very typical reaction .
it's psychological .
ln crises we look after others .
i mean ... women do .
give us a break !
you could learn from it , finn .
why don't you go get a tattoo?
don't be silly , finn !
she's right .
niels's dad spent his life working 16 hour shifts .
the only time he was with his whole family was at his funeral .
you can't accuse niels of the same thing .
he's got seven kids or however many it is , and they stick to him like warts .
we've got three , and that was a lovely way of putting it .
three , then .
it's just too much .
well , i wouldn't mind trying for another .
it doesn't surprise me .
good luck to you !
ls there any more sauce?
no .
funnily enough , not for you .
there's a drop left here , finn .
thanks .
would you phone to see how he is?
shall i phone now? ...
of course .
what did they say?
no news .
you're sure?
yes .
how long will he be in surgery?
it could be four or five hours .
when will they phone?
as soon as they know anything .
how about a toast for stine?
yes !
you really don't have to .
of course we do .
this is a no smoking area .
sorry .
good morning , cecilie .
have you had any sleep?
no , not really .
have a seat .
coffee?
yes , please .
i could give you a long lecture .
just tell me the truth .
it's not good .
joachim has broken his neck and his back .
most of his back simply got crushed .
what does that mean?
it means ...
he'll be able to talk and think .
but that's all .
does he know?
not yet .
hi .
hi .
hi , baby .
it's blown my trip to pelagonia .
yes ...
patagonia ...
yes .
i can't feel my arms or legs .
it feels really weird .
it's not a good sign , is it?
you'll never feel anything again from the neck down .
oh ... but ...
i know it sounds harsh , but you'll never be able to walk again .
i'd like to be left alone for a bit .
we've got several psychologists ...
please go now .
i'll leave the two of you .
i'm sorry .
cecilie ... please go .
joachim ...
i really mean it .
i want you to go now .
joachim ...
no , none of that .
i can't be bothered with it , ok?
damn it ... all right?
see you .
joachim ...
cecilie , stop it .
go now , damn it .
i love you .
please go .
stop that .
stop lt !
get out !
yes , we could do that , too .
or send him flowers or chocolates .
but it won't help him .
can't he have sex any more , either?
stine !
it's pretty important .
to some people , anyway .
no , he can't have sex either .
maybe i could write to him .
all right .
but it won't help him right now , or make it easier .
marie , he stepped out in front of your car .
you couldn't help it .
no .
it wasn't your fault .
marie , it wasn't !
things like that happen .
every single day .
and life goes on .
yes , for us .
but not for him .
just think of his girlfriend !
it wasn't your fault .
you know that , don't you?
tell me if there's anything you want me to bring you from home .
loads of people have phoned to ask if they can come and see you .
are you thirsty?
you're going to have to let me in on this .
you're going to have to let me help you .
i love you .
forever .
hello .
hi .
it's really nice of you to spare me the time .
of course i do .
how is he?
well ...
he won't talk to me .
i know he talks to the nurses .
but when i come he just lies there without saying anything .
and what do you do?
they say it's normal .
and that it'll pass .
it is very normal .
and it will pass .
i just don't get it .
there must be ways ...
they can do all kinds of things .
there must be something .
i wish i could be more encouraging .
but there isn't even a theoretical chance .
he only has a year left before he gets his m. sc .
we were going to get married .
what is he studying?
geography .
i'm a cook .
or ...
would you like an apple?
you've got apples?
a little bag .
for our blood sugar .
for our blood sugar?
here .
thanks .
has he dumped her or what?
i don't know .
her best friend has slept with her boyfriend .
poor stine !
as if she didn't have enough problems as it was !
i'm lost .
what problems?
what's going on?
she's not doing well at high school .
or turning up for work at the library .
and i think she's started stealing .
money keeps vanishing from my purse .
maybe she needs more pocket money .
you're such an easy touch !
she's probably upset in general , don't you think?
maybe it's affected her more than she admits?
what do you mean?
she knows she made you speed up .
do you think that's what she thinks?
i don't know what to say .
maybe it's her age .
remember what it was like?
i was never that age .
no , you weren't .
shall we just sell her and make a new one?
no , we can't .
you have to have sex for that .
i don't know if you've ever heard of it .
sex .
you mean we both have to have it?
yes .
my goodness ...
what was that?
i think it was a kiss .
you don't usually kiss me like that .
yes , i do ...
an idea to be regarded in the light of his new confidence in himself following the incident in the quarry eighteen months ago .
professor , it can't be that significant that the monument was based on frost?
will you please shut up?
i didn't think you could talk any more .
why are you doing this?
why?
why do you insist on humiliating me like this?
why do you make such a fuss?
i think you should beat it .
i promise we'll work things out .
ln about two years 'time my legs will start to wither .
they won't .
my arms will dangle like two lengths of boiled spaghetti .
at some stage they'll have to amputate the whole bloody lot .
all you'll have left will be the dead bit of skin that was once my dick .
stop it !
think about it .
i'm telling you the way it is .
you want to live with that?
yes , of course i do .
ln that case i think we should get married at once .
you'll be able to spend your wedding night wiping my arse .
do stop it !
cecilie ...
please go .
i mean it .
ln all sincerity .
i can't .
i can't just go .
i love you , damn it .
lf i love you enough you'll love yourself one day .
listen to you !
shut your face !
you've got to stop listening to all those pop lyrics .
come here ...
lf you love me as much as you keep bragging about you should walk away .
you'll do us both a favour .
stop coming here .
it's dumb .
get a life .
yes .
right?
see you around .
it doesn't have to be like this .
you're just making everything worse .
it can't be worse .
it can !
please just go .
now .
cecilie ...
i am on my way .
but i'll be back .
you will not come again .
why take it out on cecilie?
she hasn't done anything .
it'd be a fucking good idea if you shut your arsehole and turn on the tv .
by then we'd been through the repertoire several times .
she was jumping up and down on top of me .
and i had to tell her " i just can't do it any more , honey " .
hello?
hi .
this is cecilie .
l'm at the hospital .
i was wondering if you had five minutes?
who was that?
that cecilie girl .
she wants another chat .
i'd be happy to ...
finn , eat your mackerel .
and she said " i've got to have an orgasm too or i'll get a headache " .
ok . , and you said ...
take some aspirin !
then i drove home and watched bridge over the river kwai .
bloody good film , by the way .
finn , eat your mackerel .
see you in a moment .
hi .
hi .
were you nodding off to sleep?
i was admiring the weather .
breakfast is the most important meal of the day .
i never have breakfast .
oh , right , you're a cook .
after all , i don't start my day by ...
no , i don't suppose you do !
look ...
i used to live ... ... just over there .
ln randers st.
when you were a medical student?
no , as a boy .
it was my childhood home .
we used to climb over ... ... there used to be a fence .
but you don't want to hear all this .
i do !
oh , ok .
niels !
niels !
i thought i saw you .
hi , robert , hi sanne .
this is cecilie .
robert and sanne .
hello ...
so this is where you two hang out .
no , cecilie is ...
she was in the car .
when marie and stine ...
and robert sells combine harvesters .
we were airing the twins .
yes , it's good to get away from the white walls once in a while .
what was all that about?
that was sanne and robert .
robert is marie's brother and he's in combine harvesters .
so you said ... but what came over you?
i just got confused .
i forgot why we were out here .
and then they showed up .
i'm sorry .
it wasn't very ...
that's all right .
it's ok .
we can take a short cut .
cecilie?
come in .
he doesn't want to see you today .
come off it !
he says things ...
he is within his rights .
he doesn't want to see you .
maybe .
but i have to see him .
joachim?
i don't believe it .
we've got to ...
you are a fool .
calm down !
i told you to stay away .
i asked you to leave .
yes , but ...
didn't i ask you to stay away?
calm down .
i asked you to go .
calm down ...
which book?
you choose .
ls it for me?
yes .
i'll put you to bed .
good night , daddy .
daddy'll come in a moment .
niels speaking .
this is cecilie .
hi .
how are you?
it's joachim .
i know he's going through hell but he needn't be such a bastard .
i'm just as unhappy as he is .
but he doesn't care .
it's as if it's all ... ... my fault .
listen ... calm down .
lt isn't your fault .
do you hear me?
shall i come over?
yes .
right .
mummy !
gustav took my cocoa pops !
give them back , gustav .
get a move on !
stine?
how much is 20 plus 20?
forty .
size forty for a bum is plenty .
gustav !
was that you coming in so late?
yes , it was me .
where were you?
at work .
why were you up?
why weren't you asleep?
i couldn't sleep .
were you with the mishap girl?
her name is cecilie .
what do you do when you're together?
we talk .
ok .
that's nice .
you don't think it's odd?
no , i don't .
what are you trying to tell me?
she's miserable and i talk to her .
the way i talk to all my patients .
hurry up , gustav .
we've got to go .
it may take me ages to finish .
be quiet and eat up , all right?
does she like talking to you?
you're asking for it !
you go on and on .
what are you playing at?
she's lost her boyfriend .
you know how that feels , right?
that wasn't too good .
no .
she'd only just stopped crying over him .
it was wrong of me , ok?
but don't you agree she was insolent?
it was nothing compared to what she called me yesterday .
i am just tired .
i've been at work .
what did she call you?
an east german dyke .
i was proud of her .
they're doing the cold war at school now .
stine will have to pay for that plate , won't she?
joachim?
remember this?
do you?
joachim , please look at me .
you're not going to smash me like this .
you're not .
look at me , joachim !
was that it?
was that all we had together?
joachim , look at me , damn you !
my whole life also disappeared that morning .
with you .
please won't you come back to me?
won't you speak to me?
cecilie ... come along .
ls there anything i can do?
ls there anything you want?
beat it .
yes?
hello?
cecilie? ls something up?
will you come over and hold me?
yes .
of course .
was that cecilie?
yes .
what did she want?
she's upset , i think ...
should we do something?
i think she just wants to talk to someone .
she's at the hospital .
she asked if i'd come over .
can't you?
she's at the hospital all on her own .
all right .
i love you .
hi .
right , what's happened?
what's happened , cecilie?
nothing .
we're just going to stand here for a moment .
yes .
cecilie , has something happened?
no .
we're just going to stand here a moment .
i'll take the boys to school .
stine doesn't start till 10 .
ok ... have a nice day .
what's up?
showers suit you .
yes .
shall we go to norway at christmas?
gustav and emil could try skiing .
yes ... but drive stine to school first , all right?
have a nice day .
good morning , darling .
got out of bed on the wrong side?
something to do with rolf?
rolf is a jerk .
his breath smells .
ln that case what's up?
why would you care?
you're always with the mishap girl .
stine , do you mind?
are you seeing her?
just stop it .
lf you go on attacking everyone with all your crap your life will be very difficult .
she's living at the hospital?
mum feels the same way .
be nice to her .
she's losing patience with you .
right .
eat up and i'll drive you to school .
but how long will he go on feeling bitter?
it varies .
some people take years .
others take months .
some never get over it .
they die bitter and lonely .
nobody can help them .
you can't help him .
he's the only one who can .
the only way you can help him is by getting on with your own life .
but he's doing it for my sake .
no , he isn't .
he is only thinking of himself .
he's so sorry for himself that it's the only thing that matters .
it's hard .
but you must move on .
it's fine that you've met somebody else .
no need to feel guilty .
no , but it isn't for real .
he's married and stuff .
oh , so you can't fall in love with him?
i don't know .
i just want to talk to joachim .
from joachim peterson
hi .
don't come after all .
i ...
i haven't done the shopping , anyway .
i want to be alone .
'bye .
hi ...
pizza delivery .
two pizzas for cecilie pagh .
come in .
ls it ok?
yes , come on in .
wow !
you've certainly rearranged the place .
yes .
it's cosy , don't you think?
what have you done with the furniture?
joachim took it .
he needed it for something .
maybe he thought it was his .
it may also be a way of trying to tell me that there won't be a wedding .
i don't know .
maybe there'll be a wedding anyway .
you never know .
are you ok?
i'm fed up with talking about him .
i talk of nothing but him .
but do sit down ...
you don't think i should go?
no , stay .
sit down .
right .
i'll sit over here .
here .
have you cheated on marie often?
ok ...
no , i must admit i haven't .
why do you ask?
have you ever?
no .
before , i mean?
before what?
before this .
no .
not at all?
no , i haven't .
never ever?
never ever .
this is the first time .
ls there anything wrong with that?
no .
hi .
hi .
what are you doing?
nothing .
just walking .
listen .
i've been thinking .
lt's no good your not having any furniture .
you must let me buy you a sofa .
may i buy you a sofa?
wow !
so that's leather .
it's leather .
ls it comfy?
yes .
it really supports your back .
yes , it does .
it's an incredibly lovely sofa .
we sell lots of them .
but it's very dark .
haven't you a lighter model?
not this one .
we have other sofas that are lighter .
but this one is incredibly practical .
you wipe it with a damp cloth .
and if it tears you can patch it with your trousers .
we'll take it .
i saw something over here , too .
do you only have one of these?
no , we've lots .
we'll take two of them .
two of them .
and ...
we'd like to look at a bed .
ln that case you'll have to move down the bus , please .
straight ahead and turn left by the stairs .
then sharp left again .
i'll be with you in a moment .
sharp ... left .
it was brown .
aren't you coming up?
yes .
it's very clever .
lf we have a row we won't have to turn our backs on each other .
i see you've found the mattresses .
they're incredibly lovely mattresses .
elevating mattresses .
i was wondering what the benefits of this position are .
it's incredibly comfortable if you like watching tv or reading in bed .
lots of people do .
yes , i can tell .
it's actually a pleasant position .
are there any that don't move like this?
of course .
but then it'll just be an ordinary mattress .
obviously .
but can't you get the same quality?
yes , but as i say , it wouldn't be an elevating mattress .
ls there a difference between these two?
ln addition to price , this one is an incredibly good mattress .
you get a lot of mattress for your money .
it's the ferrari of mattresses .
oh , is it? ln that case we'll take two .
and two mattress mats .
oh , goodbye !
i think that'll do it .
i think we've a couple of bookcases left for our other customers .
down i go ...
you're mad .
i'll pay for it all .
no , you won't .
it's just furniture .
lf you win the lottery you can give me some money .
there may be a couple of day's delivery time .
that's all right .
i think we'll just stay here .
oh , no , no , no !
stop it !
hanne !
hanne?
damn it !
look at this !
hanne !
did you call?
no .
look !
it keeps turning the pages back .
it's very clever .
i can't read backwards , you jerk .
give mikkel a call .
i'll have to wait till tomorrow .
no , i've got to have another machine .
it's the 9th time .
we'll have to ask one of the technicians tomorrow .
yes , let's tell one of the technicians tomorrow .
would you like some water?
no .
i don't want any water .
funny you should mention water .
why ...?
because i heard a little story about your son michael .
who told you about michael?
i don't quite remember ...
who told you about michael?
someone in a white coat?
lf you ever mention michael's name i'll ...
you'll what?
you'll what?
just tell me !
come on , hanne , my lass , come on !
you'll what?
just never mention michael's name .
get the message?
never !
oh , i didn't mean to ...
to what?
i'm only asking because ...
because what?
death by drowning , right?
it's meant to be ... ... as far as i've heard ... one of the very , very worst ...
no , i don't think so .
do you know what the very , very worst is?
no?
it's being a selfcentred little bastard
lying in a hospital bed , pitiful and helpless while his girlfriend is in love with another man .
that's the very , very worst thing .
get the message?
i'm sorry .
it's not true .
she phones every single day .
hi !
hi , finn .
by the way , i saw that cecilie girl .
oh?
ok?
she's a looker .
are you shafting her?
finn , her boyfriend is in room 3092 and he's a quadriplegic .
yes , but are you shafting her?
that's right , just ask me directly .
well , somebody is .
it shows .
that's good .
it's what she needs .
i just didn't know you had it in you .
it's great to see .
ls it?
well , you are a warm , very likeable person , finn .
just don't screw up .
it's not serious , is it?
will you just shut up?
what a mess , eh?
how old are gustav and emil?
six and eight .
does marie know?
no .
funnily enough she thinks gustav is in his mid thirties .
