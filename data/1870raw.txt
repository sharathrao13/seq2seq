are you kathy nicolo?
yeah .
is this your house?
nadi , of course , agreed that it was a wonderful idea to cut down the trees at our home on the caspian , to have the sea spread before us , to reach infinity with our eyes , to see forever .
but then , our life went the way of the trees when the ayatollahs ripped the soul out of our beautiful country .
well , enough .
today is not a day for the old .
it is a day for the young .
to the future .
to our soraya .
may she be a happy wife as she is a bride .
and , perhaps , she will not forget her poor mother and father so soon and return to us and give to us many little grandbabies .
a father can dream .
he's so tan .
retirement has been good to the colonel .
he's not .
he works for boeing .
he doesn't work for boeing .
my son works for boeing .
who knows what he does now?
i love you
es todo .
terminamos .
hello .
kathy?
what time is it?
it's , um , 9 : 00 .
mom , it's 6 : 00 a . m . here .
i don't think 6 : 00 a . m . will kill you .
your father got up at 4 : 30 every day of his life ,
god bless his soul .
so , how's it going?
how's the program?
fine .
i'm fine .
one day at a time , right?
i just hope it's working .
how's everyone there?
frankie's good .
salesman of the month again .
you know your brother .
his lisa's in her seventh month .
wow .
how's your better half?
fine .
he's right here .
he's sleeping .
sleeping?
hmm .
mom , i'm really tired .
i'm gonna go , okay?
listen .
i almost forgot .
your aunt frances won a trip to reno .
we're gonna come out on the 18th .
i thought we'd stop by .
the 18th?
yeah .
two weeks .
yeah , okay .
um , nick's gonna be away on business , though .
again?
yeah .
wow .
i'm gonna go , okay , mom?
you're still not smoking , right?
bye .
'cause they say it's a slippery ...
just a second !
you kathy lazaro?
yeah .
why?
due to the nonpayment of business taxes associated with this property , the county has petitioned the court on its behalf to reclaim these costs .
it should come as no surprise to you .
i'm sure you've had ample warning .
we've sent many notices .
now the house is up for auction tomorrow morning .
auction?
what are you talking about?
are you out of your mind?
there's no smoking in my house .
hey , chuck .
'cause i see your number right here .
yeah .
we gonna meet down there?
supposed to be a hot one today .
i'd dress lightly if i were you .
it's okay , 'cause i'm not leaving .
i'm afraid you have no choice , mrs. lazaro .
all of your things will be auctioned off with the property .
do you want that?
look , you can't evict me .
i never owed a fucking business tax .
it doesn't make sense .
okay , well , this is where i get off .
deputy sheriff burdon will assist you in vacating the property .
do you have a lawyer?
i can't afford a lawyer .
i'm a house cleaner .
here's the number for the legal assistance office .
they may be able to help .
nothing's written in blood .
you just have to clear out today .
you might be moving back in next week .
in the meantime , maybe you can call some friends or family .
stay with them .
there's no one to call .
i'll tell you what .
i know some movers that owe me a favor .
brian .
go down to safeway and get some boxes .
let's help this lady pack up .
lester .
may i help you?
my car is parked here .
you asked yesterday also .
oh , oh , what happened to you?
i fell .
again?
yeah .
wash up .
do not get blood on the floor .
the house was repossessed for tax payment delinquency .
it's got three bedrooms , one bath .
a widow's walk would increase property value .
what is this " widow's walk "?
a deck on top of the house so you can see the ocean .
we still got time here .
feel free to look around .
nadereh .
today god has kissed our eyes .
do you remember our bungalow on the caspian , how i ordered the trees cut down on the west side so we may view the sea?
please , be quiet .
do you remember how the general brought his family there for new year , how beautiful it was?
what is the matter for you today , behrani?
nadi?
i today have bought for us another bungalow .
i purchased this home for a price no one would believe .
it is worth two , maybe three times that .
we will live in this home for a short while and then sell it and find one even better .
nah !
nah !
perhaps you did not come here to live like a gypsy .
but i did not come here to work like an arab ... to be treated like an arab .
for four years we have lived a life we could not afford and spent almost everything to marry soraya with a good family .
this apartment alone has cost us over $140, 000 in rent .
and what of esmail's university education?
soon we will have nothing .
and then you will see what it is like to walk in the shoes of the gypsies .
so ... tomorrow , you will begin packing , and there's no more to discuss .
do not open your lips .
$500?
they evicted you from your house for that?
you got it .
um , are you staying with friends?
yeah , i'm with a friend .
how much is this gonna cost me?
it's on a sliding scale .
um , how come you didn't do something about this earlier?
i did .
i went to the courthouse , months ago , and i signed a statement saying that i never owed a business tax because i never owned a business .
i even had it certified .
and what about the follow up mail?
i didn't open it .
it's very important to me that i get my house back by the 18th .
i'm expecting company .
when did you sign that letter?
i don't know .
march?
well , i hate to be the bearer of bad news , but the county's already sold your house .
what?
no .
they can't do that .
the auction date's been set for months .
don't worry .
they'll rescind the sale , or we'll file a lawsuit against the county .
we'll get your house back .
before the 18th , right?
it's possible .
fuck .
hello .
sorry .
shit .
i didn't mean to scare you .
don't do that .
you all right?
yeah .
i'm fine .
you?
good .
good .
you working undercover or something?
excuse me?
no .
i'm off .
i just ...
i drive by this way , and , uh ... figured i'd check in on you , see how you're holding up .
they already sold your house?
technically , it's mine and my brother's .
my dad left it to us when he died .
i haven't told my family .
my lawyer's trying to get them to rescind it .
so i'm trying not to harp on the negative .
you have any kids , mr. burdon?
two .
call me lester .
my husband left me eight months ago .
no one knows that , either .
do you mind if i give you some professional advice?
no .
do it all through your lawyer , kathy .
i wouldn't drive past that house till the keys were back in my hand .
thanks for checking in on me .
sure .
night .
hey , kathy , wait .
listen .
this is my direct number at the department .
most of the time , i'm on patrol .
but if you ever need anything , anything at all , just leave a message .
see ya .
good night .
it is like our garden in lsfahan .
hello?
hello?
yeah?
your credit card didn't go through .
that's two days now .
god , i'm really sorry about that .
look , um , i'm gonna get my paycheck on friday .
is there any way we can let it slide until then?
the only affordable way to put a terrace up there is to put the stairs on the outside .
it'll have to block that kitchen window .
i could do that for about a grand .
i could do that for about a grand .
if we have to go through the roof , about $4, 000 to $7, 000 .
but this window must be obstructed?
i don't see any other way .
that is acceptable .
can you start today?
hey !
hey !
what are you doing?
excuse me?
what the fuck are you doing?
this is my house .
who are you?
this is my house .
who said you could do this?
are you mrs. behrani?
no .
mr. behrani hired us .
you're gonna have to talk to him .
oh , fuck .
whoa , lady .
shit .
damn !
stay right there .
don't move .
hold on .
ah ! oh , man .
let's get her inside .
fuck .
come on .
careful .
could we use your bathroom?
she stepped on ...
sorry , ma'am .
could we use your washroom to clean her foot?
okay .
it is okay .
for one moment , please .
here .
i got it .
here you go .
thanks .
have you had a tetanus shot lately?
i'm gonna be sick .
is she bleeding?
excuse me .
esmail , a bandage . okay .
i don't want to ruin your towel .
here .
i use this for skateboarding .
don't worry .
i washed it .
okay .
this is , of course , our family pictures .
thank you .
i think i should go .
what happened?
i'll tell you what happened .
my yard is a construction site .
you were there?
yeah , i was there .
i was at my house .
i stepped on some nails .
i was bleeding on my own doorstep , waiting for a stranger to open my door .
you can't just go over there .
you've got to let us handle this .
i want them out of my house .
they're already more at home there than i ever was .
did you get their name?
ah ...
bahroony?
behmini , something like that .
they're middle eastern .
gary?
yes , connie?
will you type a letter to the courier service and make sure that it gets to a mr. behrmini?
it's damn hard to sell a house nowadays .
this is what you call a real buyer's market .
well , sorry , but she comes in at ... $174, 000 .
you're late , behrani .
i am not late .
i have come to tell you that i'm no longer to return to this job .
you tell the office , colonel?
no .
so why tell me , man?
is this you?
hmm .
... inform you ... that under these circumstances ... " currently owe , or as a property ...
we request that you vacate the property immediately .
mother whores !
goddamn it !
mr. barmeeny is here .
oh , mr. barmeeny .
my name is behrani .
colonel massoud amir behrani .
i wish to speak with mr. walsh , please .
i'm connie walsh .
this is my office , colonel .
please come in .
i'm sure our letter came as a shock to you , colonel .
pacific county has made a number of mistakes .
first , they levied a tax on my client which she did not owe .
second , they evicted her for nonpayment .
and third , they auctioned the property .
unfortunately , this is where you come in .
but i now own the house .
i paid for it in cash .
i have a bill of sale .
here , please .
would you sell the county back the house?
they would make it as comfortable a transaction as possible .
please listen to me very carefully .
the only comfortable transaction possible is if the county tax office paid to me $174, 000 .
mr. behrani , you only paid a quarter of that amount .
the market can already pay me this .
good morning , miss walsh .
wait , please .
from a legal standpoint , you are in the right .
but the true owner of this house is living in a motel , mr. behrani .
all her belongings are locked in storage .
why should she wait to get back into her home that was wrongfully taken?
just because you want to turn a profit .
things are not as they appear .
it is a matter of necessity for me and my family .
i'm sorry .
i do not have a choice in this matter .
hey .
this is a surprise .
good one or a bad one?
it's good .
it's good .
what happened to your foot? oh , i , um ...
i stopped by my house , and they were doing construction on the roof .
i stepped on some nails .
thanks for letting me ride along today , mr. burdon .
so , how's the el rancho?
i'm not there anymore .
i'm staying at the bonneville now .
i don't know it .
you're looking at it .
i haven't had a drink in three years , lester . oh , i'm sorry .
i ...
i should have asked .
i didn't know .
no , it's okay .
the fog's coming in .
i'd like to ask you a personal question , if i could . okay .
just get it over with .
why is your husband no longer with you?
i wanted kids .
he didn't want kids .
but i guess if he really wanted me , he would have wanted them , too .
i think he's a fool .
maybe we should find you a place to stay .
do you remember the beauty of the caspian sea , esmail?
the water like glass .
the beach sand like gold .
it is beautiful here .
massoud , when must we move again?
not too soon .
perhaps once we get a buyer , we will tell them to wait until autumn .
would you prefer that?
i will do as you wish .
there was this little runt of a guy .
kept beating up his wife .
except she wouldn't press charges .
we'd show up , and there they'd be at the door
like romeo and juliet , arm in arm .
she had welts and bruises all over .
so , one night we get called out there again , and i slipped down their hallway and stuffed two eight balls in his closet .
turns out he was on parole .
he goes back to jail , she's safe , and i slept like a baby .
did i just lose you?
no .
i'm sorry .
i , um ...
to tell you the truth , i think the wine's distracting me .
i'll send it back .
no , it's fine .
you sure?
yeah .
see , when i think of my sobriety , i don't think about wine .
alcohol was never a problem .
well , you're a grown woman .
cheers .
what are your kids 'names?
nate and bethany .
nate is four .
bethany is nine .
where is your house?
in millbrae .
in a housing development called palomino meadows .
you have to drive through it to get to the mall .
yeah , i know where that is .
god , i've probably driven by it a dozen times .
i've probably even seen your wife .
carol .
yeah .
carol .
what's your situation , les?
i married my best friend .
and for seven of the last nine years ,
i haven't wanted to give her more than a hug or a peck on the cheek .
that's my situation .
what about her?
it's not the same for her .
do you want to come inside?
massoud .
we are blessed .
what time is it?
it's 10 : 00 . oh , god .
i should have been home hours ago .
i'm sure carol called the department .
i'm sure they asked her if i was feeling any better .
things are finally in motion .
i'm finally gonna get it over with .
it?
telling her the truth about how i feel .
how do you feel?
i feel found .
well , kathy , bad news .
the county's done their part , but the new owner won't go along .
he's asking for four times what he bought it for .
we can sue the county , but it'll take months .
do you mean that ...
i can't legally get my house back?
it would've been a lot easier if you'd just opened your mail .
you can't expect the law to work miracles .
i don't expect miracles .
i expect you to do your fucking job .
i don't know what i'm doing sitting here talking to you .
and as you see , very excellent rooms .
it is cool inside , even during the day .
and from the widow's walk , sunsets are quite beautiful .
there is very little fog in this area .
when would the house be available?
not until autumn .
we would need time to find a new home .
that might work for us .
yes .
she has come for a tool her boyfriend carpenter may have left behind .
i have been expecting her . one moment , please .
i am happy you came .
please , this way .
i will show you .
my family knows nothing of this .
i'd like for it to remain so .
you have me confused with someone else .
i'm quite certain i know who you are .
i'm kathy nicolo .
i know my lawyer talked to you , mr. bahrooni ,
but i thought we could meet face to face .
my name is behrani .
colonel behrani .
colonel behrani , i'm sorry .
my father left this house to me and my brother .
tell this to the bureaucrats at the county tax office .
they have made a mistake , not i.
they said they'd give you your money back .
you've put that deck on .
i'm sure they'd repay you for that .
i'm sorry , but i've nothing more to say .
why should i be penalized for their incompetence?
you should sue them for enough to buy ten homes .
i'll even sell you this house for the right price .
that's all i require .
i don't know where he left his hammers .
i've nothing more to say .
let go of me .
you can't expect to just move in here and make money off of this .
this is my house .
i lived here , and you stole this house from me , you son of a bitch !
this is a stolen house !
he's trying to sell you a stolen house !
what'd you tell your kids?
i told them the truth .
my old man walked out on us .
i swore i would never do that to my own .
what happened?
my lawyer couldn't get the house back .
so i went to see the owner .
and he put his hand on you?
it's okay .
don't worry about it .
that's not right .
he's got no right to do that .
who is this guy?
his name's behrani .
he's a colonel .
behrani?
what country is he from?
i don't know .
but his wife hardly speaks any english .
maybe they haven't been here that long .
maybe they don't know their way around .
what are you doing?
i'm gonna pay 'em a visit .
officers tend to listen to other officers .
it's worth a shot .
what if he doesn't listen?
then i'll make him listen .
oomadan !
oomadan !
little bird .
little bird !
little bird !
welcome to our new home .
does it go down the hill?
it is an investment property , soraya .
like our second home on the caspian .
it's an investment home .
let us go to the roof porch , for the view .
jesus , look at them .
what are they celebrating , stealing a woman's house?
fuck these people .
you're a very wise man , genob sarhang , to live in such a place that gives you a view of god's wonders .
did you post that sign , sir?
yes .
is there a difficulty , officer?
and that's your sign at the bottom of the hill?
yes .
please , come in , officer .
