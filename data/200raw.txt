you know what they can do to you?
yes , mother .
you are not safe .
you may be directing this movie , but what you're asking , we can't do .
don't tell me it can't be done .
the gyro forces are too much .
you send these planes into barrel rolls ... ... they won't make it .
it's the climax of the picture .
make it work .
decrease the vertical trajectory if you have to .
a le rhne rotary won't stall at 60 degrees .
we're still short two cameras .
we need to cut that sequence down ...
we're not cutting .
i'll get those cameras .
set up for rehearsals .
i'm noah dietrich .
your office said i'd find you here .
dietrich .
you're a man on the come .
i read your rsum , talked to your references .
know what i'm looking for?
you're looking for a second in command at hughes tools .
someone to oversee the financial aspects of the business .
i'm looking for somebody to run it and do a good job .
there's only one thing you've gotta know .
my folks , they're gone now .
so it's my money .
what i do with that money may seem crazy to those sons of bitches in houston .
i'm sure it does , but it all makes good sense to me .
you got that?
got it .
good .
now , you made , what , $5200 a year at your last job?
i'll pay you $ 10, 000 .
i guess i'll be working twice as hard .
you'll be working four times as hard .
i just got you at half price .
welcome aboard .
thank you .
you're my voice now .
make them understand that .
some of those folks still call me junior .
you tell them it's " mr. hughes " now .
you bet .
so when do we go to houston?
we don't .
cholera epidemic in 1913 .
two thousand dead .
whole place is nothing but pestilential swamp .
typhus , malaria , cholera , yellow fever .
you name it , they got it .
you see that , mr. dietrich?
you are looking at the largest private air force in the entire world .
what do you think of that , now?
it's your money .
start them up !
i saw the rough cut of the new tod browning movie , london after midnight .
lon chaney is incredible .
it's his best performance in a long time .
it's gonna be a big hit .
the cards are great .
it's supposed to be ...
hello , mr. mayer .
i don't know if you remember me .
my name's howard hughes .
i was wondering if i could have a moment .
oh , howard hughes .
the airplane picture?
exactly .
i remember .
hell's angels .
you heard of it .
good .
yes .
i was wondering if i could have a moment of your time .
i need a few cameras .
yeah?
yeah , two , to be exact .
i bought every camera i could find .
we're shooting our big dogfight sequence .
i need two more .
desperately .
you think mgm could help me out?
with what?
cameras .
oh , with the actual cam ...
we're not usually in the practice of helping out competition .
no .
no .
so how many cameras do you have now?
twenty four .
you ...?
wait a minute .
you have 24 cameras?
that's right .
and you need ...?
you need two more?
yeah .
you don't think you got it with 24?
no .
no , sir .
you know , i think ...
i think we've got them all ...
don't we have them ...?
they're all used , right?
all 26 of them .
i only need two , sir .
jesus christ , sonny .
howard .
howard .
let me give you a little advice , huh?
take your oil money ...
drill bits .
all right , take your drill bit money and put it in the bank .
if you continue making the movie the way you are ... ... there isn't gonna be a distributor ... ... you won't find anybody who wants to see the movie ... ... and you're not gonna have any more oil money .
so welcome to hollywood .
yeah .
well , i'll be sure to remember that , mr. mayer .
good luck .
all right .
he needs 26 to make it work?
he's out of his mind .
i looked down at my pants .
it was a strange situation .
boss .
scram , love boat , let's go .
another soda .
you know what i mean .
milk .
in the bottle .
with the cap still on .
okay , what did his highness say?
son of a bitch won't part with a single goddamn camera .
why don't you try and make do with what you have .
what i have isn't enough , john , not for how i see it .
look .
my name depends on this picture .
if it doesn't work , i'm back to houston ... ... making goddamn drill bits for the rest of my life .
can't you do it with the cameras you have?
you ought to hear about what's going on with demille .
he's shooting his bible picture .
he's gotta do a crucifixion in fresno .
johnny .
a bunch of tractors ...
johnny .
you're a press agent , are you not?
yeah .
you're supposed to know the ins and outs?
absolutely .
do you?
yeah , absolutely .
then you leave the big ideas ... ... to me .
oh , yeah .
of course , boss .
cigar , cigarettes , sen sen?
i thought you were at the brown derby ... ... with trixie .
no , theresa .
margaret .
margaret .
exactly .
what happened to margaret?
she lost her ...
thank god that's settled .
oh , i'm sorry .
thelma , this is howard hughes .
howard and i were discussing how he wants me to pull a camera out of my ass .
cigarette?
oh , no , thanks .
i don't smoke .
boy , you are just hitting on all six cylinders , aren't you?
my god .
would you do me a favor and just ...?
would you just smile for me one time?
just once?
yeah .
yeah .
you see , you got a short upper lip .
makes for a much nicer smile .
see , i wonder what gives a beautiful woman like you pleasure .
i mean , say you're just standing there , right?
and i just touch you .
just ...
just like this .
with my fingertips .
do you ...?
do you like that?
do you?
you see , i wanna learn what pleases you .
i wanna learn everything about you .
would you let me do that?
would you give me that job?
i'm off in a half an hour .
well , i'm in room ...
217 .
217 .
see you there .
johnny , get on the horn to universal and warners .
i need two more cameras by saturday .
rent them if you can .
steal them if you have to .
absotively , boss .
absotively .
rumors coming from a lonely airstrip out in van nuys .
sources whisper that young texas industrialist howard hughes ... ... won't stop pouring money into his war epic .
and do we mean epic !
one hundred and thirty seven pilots , 87 airplanes ... ... 35 cameramen , 2000 extras .
how long will it be before this picture ... ... ends up costing as much as the real war?
damn it .
why the hell do they look so slow?
this isn't what it was like up there .
they look like goddamn models !
son of a bitch .
howard?
without something standing still behind the planes ... ... we've got no idea of how fast we're moving .
we got no sense of relative motion .
call ucla .
get me the best meteorologist they got .
you get him here in an hour , all right?
hey .
you want the good news or the bad news?
bad news , always .
all right .
we installed the 450 radial .
struts won't take the vibration .
minute we fire her up , the struts start cracking at the attach points .
well , what's the good news?
there isn't any .
goddamn it , odie .
if the 450's too big , we figure something else out .
we've done everything .
we've rebuilt her from top to toe .
if we drain the fuel tank ... ... she might make 180 miles per hour .
i want minimum 200 , all right?
i want a date with theda bara .
that ain't gonna happen .
oh , don't be so sure .
if the struts won't sustain the engine we need , we gotta get rid of the struts .
no , then the top wing falls off .
then let it .
what?
who says we need a top wing?
i mean , who says we need anything?
a monoplane .
a cantilevered monoplane , right?
they're doing it in france .
to hell with the top wing and struts .
a 550 wasp engine .
one hundred octane fuel .
that would give us a horsepower of what?
seven hundred .
we squeeze that to a thousand , we got the fastest plane ever built .
you know , i've gotta say ... ... we've already spent over $200, 000 rebuilding this plane .
to hell with it .
tear it up , odie .
go on .
well ...
the cumulonimbus formations about which you speak ... ... that look like ...
giant breasts full of milk .
i want clouds , damn it .
yes , clouds ... ... that look like giant breasts full of milk ... ... cannot exactly be guaranteed for any particular occasion .
so you might have to ...
to wait .
then we'll wait .
look , whatever they pay you at ucla ... ... i'm doubling it , all right?
you work for me now .
find some clouds .
find some clouds .
find me some clouds !
welcome to hell's angels .
thank you .
i've been to chatsworth , santa cruz , encino , san diego ... ... riverside , van nuys and bakersfield .
it has been eight months !
where are my goddamn clouds , huh?
they move , mr. hughes !
clouds move .
that's what they do .
they move !
you see that?
it is costing me $5271 a day ... ... to keep those planes on the ground .
you find me some goddamn clouds , huh?
nice day .
yeah , very funny .
i got a call from houston .
they're getting nervous .
stop showing them the damn bills .
that would be illegal .
shit , no .
maybe it's a little bit naughty .
hughes tool is incorporated in texas .
they have to see the bills .
incorporate a new division out here .
we'll call it hughes aircraft .
do we need these rivets on the cowling?
yeah , or the reverse thrust would rip it off .
they're gonna give me drag .
do something about that .
wind resistance on rivets?
i want her slippery .
there are tax consequences to incorporating in california .
just take care of it , would you?
mr. hughes !
oakland !
we have clouds in oakland !
you mean it this time?
yes !
goddamn it , yes .
i can promise you .
clouds in oakland .
all right , don't get all jittery now .
oakland !
oakland !
we're going to oakland !
oakland .
down and to the left !
that's perfect !
that's right , senator george .
yes , young howard hughes has pulled it off !
after two years , hell's angels has finally finished filming .
there's gonna be one heck of a wrap party in hollywood tonight .
the price tag?
a staggering $ 2 million .
if every human being in america buys a ticket ... ... he might even make a profit .
first , clouds don't come .
then planes break down .
then the planes crash .
we've had everything but a plague of locusts on this thing .
i mean , you have to admit .
now , honestly , did you ever think you'd actually finish the damn thing?
come with me .
mama , darling , if i'm a success in this show ...
... we're gonna move from here .
oh , no .
yes .
we're gonna move up in the bronx .
green grass , a lot of people you know .
the ginsbergs , the guttenbergs and the goldbergs .
oh , a whole lot of " bergs .
i don't know them all .
see , this is what the people want .
silent pictures are yesterday's news .
so i figure we gotta reshoot hell's angels for sound .
how much of it?
all of it .
before you ask , i'll tell you .
an additional 1 . 7 million .
we got that much?
no !
well , we'll make it .
take care of that , would you?
now , get this .
in the halls of 7000 romaine ... ... it goes on day after day , month after month .
howard hughes is now editing some 25 miles of film .
heck , i say release it now and give the world its first 560 hour movie .
pat , mr. hughes needs this reel in the projection room right now !
enough is enough , mr. hughes .
are you ever gonna let us actually see this epic of yours?
hurry up !
who is it?
noah .
come on in .
i've been on the phone to houston for three hours .
we're fixing every goddamn book we have .
wait , wait .
yeah .
run reel 10 again .
i think we're duplicating a shot here .
and tell jimmy i want 10 chocolate chip cookies , all right?
medium chips , none too close to the outside .
got it?
you remember that goddamn shot from reel 10?
no .
i don't remember anything from reel 10 .
i don't know what reel 10 is .
i'm a businessman , howard .
and so are you .
now , look .
this has been a great ride .
we've had a hell of a lot of fun .
but you're losing $25, 000 a day doing this .
every day .
so , what are my options?
well , this time i don't know that you have any .
i'm afraid you gotta close it down .
dig your way out .
i'm sorry , howard .
i truly am .
reel 10 , mr. hughes .
mortgage tool co .
every asset .
you heard me .
lf you do that , you could lose everything .
well , i won't .
i won't .
all right .
i'll get into it .
thanks , noah .
more than half a million souls lining the curb of hollywood boulevard .
look at the automobiles !
there are 45, 000 cars here , making it the greatest traffic jam ever seen .
howard hughes must have a lump in his throat .
six months after the stock market crashes and after three pilots 'deaths ... ... he's finally unveiling his $4 million baby doll .
it's the most expensive movie ever made .
nothing five and dime for our mr. hughes .
nothing like tonight has ever been seen before , and i can say ... ... it will never be seen again .
five hundred thousand people are crowding the streets to get a glimpse of the stars .
three companies of marines were called to assist ... ... the 250 special police who are handling this enormous crowd ...
this is an industry town .
and nobody but nobody makes a movie outside a studio .
some hollywood insiders over at the brown derby may be laughing ...
and now , i think ...
yes , yes , i can see mr. hughes 'car arriving now .
mr. hughes escorts the lovely starlet jean harlow .
he discovered her for this picture , and we think her platinum blond locks ... ... and hot jazz , baby doll style are gonna make her a big star .
howard !
howard !
over here !
this way , boss .
right over there .
mr. hughes , how about a word?
big night for you , mr. hughes .
big night for you tonight .
very big .
very big .
tell us what it was like making this fabulous picture .
yes .
yeah .
so 4 million clams from your own pocket .
nervous how the flick will fly?
big night .
you enjoy the show .
yes , well , let me present the feminine star of this spectacle , hell's angels ... ... miss jean harlow .
thank you .
i would like to use this occasion to thank mr. hughes ... ... for the opportunity he gave me .
thank you .
thank you !
now i'd like to ask roscoe arbuckle ... ... to introduce his pet lion cub , gilmore .
what's the matter with you?
can't remember my name?
i'm sorry .
roscoe turner , and this would be gilmore .
it's going !
it's going !
murder !
that's what this dirty , rotten politician war is , murder !
you know it as well as i do .
stand up , slim , take a bow .
reel four played too long .
too many coughs .
get the team out of the party and to the office .
i wanna cut a few shots .
oh , find glenn .
somebody write this down .
flush rivets .
got that?
flush rivets .
flush rivets .
lickety split , boss .
here he is !
here he is !
variety says , " this one won't miss !
magnificently photographed !
awesome beyond description !
the most extraordinary output to emerge from a motion picture studio .
not for a long time have i seen anything as enthralling .
it costs 4 million dollars and has 4 million thrills !
majestically ...
most epic picture of its time !
a lighter shade .
i don't want to look like boris karloff .
if you know what i mean .
i read in the magazines that you play golf .
on occasion .
well , how about nine holes?
now , mr. hughes?
if it would be convenient , miss hepburn .
you're not extending enough on your follow through .
follow through is everything in golf , just like life .
don't you find?
saw your scarface picture .
violent .
realistic .
movies are movies , howard .
not life .
now the stage .
the stage is real .
real flesh and blood .
human beings right out there in front of you , buster .
can't look away .
can't munch popcorn .
that would be rude .
do you like the theater?
no .
oh , i adore the theater .
only alive on stage .
i'll teach you .
we'll see some ibsen .
if the republicans haven't outlawed him by now .
you're not a republican , are you?
how did you vote in '32?
well , i didn't .
you must !
it's your sacred franchise .
heard you were wooing ginger rogers .
what about that?
she's just a friend .
men can't be friends with women .
they must possess them or leave them be .
it's a primitive urge from caveman days .
it's all in darwin .
hunt the flesh , kill the flesh , eat the flesh .
that's the male sex all over .
excuse me?
well , if you're deaf , you must own up to it .
get a hearing aid .
or see my father .
he's a urologist , but it's all tied up inside the body , don't you find?
me , i keep healthy .
i take seven showers a day to keep clean .
also because i am what's so vulgarly referred to as " outdoorsy .
i'm not outdoorsy .
i'm athletic .
i sweat .
there it is .
now we both know the sordid truth .
i sweat and you're deaf .
aren't we a fine pair of misfits?
three .
noble effort .
so i suppose you're wooing me now?
oh , well .
not enough .
not enough .
these rivets have to be completely flush .
i want every screw and joint countersunk .
i want no wind resistance on the fuselage .
she has got to be clean , odie .
clean .
understand?
okay , howard .
i don't know what else to tell you .
what do you got for me?
the thing is , twa needs a new plane .
a modern plane .
oh , yeah?
what kind of plane?
okay .
the dc 3 has 21 daytime seats ... ... and 14 overnight berths .
something bigger?
try 50 seats with a ceiling of 12, 000 feet .
no .
no , 20, 000 .
think about it .
what does 20, 000 feet give you?
less turbulence .
because it's above the weather .
jack , we wanna fly above the weather .
only 1 percent of the american population has set foot on an airliner .
why?
because they're scared to death .
they should be .
i mean , 7000 feet is bumpy as shit .
you know that .
we build a plane that flies above the weather ... ... we could get every man , woman and child in this country to feel safe .
an airplane with the ability to fly into the substratosphere across the country .
across the world .
now that is the future .
you with me?
yeah .
i don't wanna get into this if your board doesn't have the balls for it .
would they support us?
i don't know .
what's your financial picture?
not great .
last year's deficit?
770, 000 .
what's it selling at?
about 8 dollars a share .
that's the lowest it's been , huh?
i could do that .
do what?
buy it .
you wanna buy the airline?
for crying out loud ... ... we don't want pencil pushers getting in the way of us making our plane .
give me brass tacks , now .
what does controlling interest in twa cost me?
call it 15 million .
that is a chunk of change , huh?
you call noah dietrich .
you have him start buying .
howard , hold on .
are you sure?
you wanna think about it for five minutes?
hell , jack , i got a tiger by the tail here .
i ain't gonna let it go .
good evening , mr. hughes .
welcome .
your table is ready .
how goes the aviation?
oh , just fine , pete .
i'm so glad .
good evening , mr. hughes .
madame .
it's " miss .
miss .
the usual , mr. hughes?
please .
may i recommend for the lady ... ... our clementine soup followed by roast duck with currant glaze ... ... and poached pears in rose sauce .
it's truly divine .
yeah .
that sounds fine .
your kind of joint , is it?
wouldn't have thought .
they're open late .
i go to a hot dog stand on la cienega too .
they're open till about 4 .
are they?
how marvelous .
howard !
howard !
hi !
son of a gun .
kate , this is johnny meyer .
i suppose you could call him my press agent .
pleased to meet you .
loved alice adams .
you're too kind .
i'm sure you know errol , right?
mr. flynn .
yes .
kate .
kate .
kate of the clenched jawed hepburns .
enchanting as always .
you should use lux on your hands , by the way .
i do .
you and howard ought to cook up a picture .
costar with errol .
i could sell that in spades .
that would be marvelous .
howard?
i think not .
don't you read variety , mr. meyer?
well , i'm box office poison .
i'm on the outs , the skids , the doldrums .
washed up , day old fish not worth the eating , so they tell me .
hell with them .
hell with them , my dear .
soulless pricks to a man , right?
johnny tells me you're thinking about doing a western , of all goddamn things .
are you making a western , howard?
yeah .
making a western .
i'm gonna call it the outlaw .
yeah .
and you know what it's about?
s e x.
it's all about s e x.
it's a western .
you can't have fornication in a western .
it isn't done .
it's not real sex , it's movie sex .
what scarface did for the gangster picture , the outlaw will do for the western .
put the sex and guts and blood up there on the screen .
have you seen my cigarettes?
don't mind us .
new york cut steak , 12 peas , bottle of milk with the cap on .
you can't afford your own cigarettes?
jack has all my money .
i hope your food isn't getting cold at your table somewhere or something .
no , no .
we're here all night .
don't worry .
now , howard .
now , howard .
if you're seriously talking about putting carnality ... ... back on the silver screen , you must swear to let me in on the casting session .
i have an eye for talent .
isn't that right?
you ought to give up prancing in tights ... ... be a talent scout .
that prancing paid for my new yacht .
you must all come sailing with me .
catalina .
what do you say?
catalina .
sounds grand .
yeah .
i've even managed to coax ... ... the luscious miss de havilland and her equally luscious sister to come .
though i fear their mother will insist on coming , to preserve their questionable virtue .
we shall assault these twin monuments of pristine britannic beauty nonetheless .
what do you say , howard?
yeah?
yeah .
yeah .
yeah?
i gotta go .
if you'll excuse us , we have ...
we have to be somewhere .
you are somewhere , howard , you madman .
somewhere else .
excuse us .
charmed , gentlemen .
do help yourself to the poached pears .
i hear they're divine .
well .
howard hughes , ladies and gentlemen .
was that meant for me?
my hero .
god , all that hollywood talk bores me silly .
as if there aren't more important things , like mussolini .
where are we going , by the way?
do you feel like a little adventure?
do your worst , mr. hughes .
think you own this place , you limey bastard?
i'm a tasmanian bastard , you prick .
thataway , errol .
let me at him !
that's mr. mayer's house right there .
do you know where jack warner lives?
what's that on the steering wheel?
cellophane .
if you had any idea of the crap that people carry around on their hands .
what kind of crap?
you don't wanna know .
hold on to the wheel for a bit .
that's too hard .
relax your hand .
relax your hand .
you see , you gotta feel the vibration of the engine through your fingertips .
do you feel that?
yes .
well , that's good .
golly !
well , she's all yours .
where are you going? !
i think there's some milk back here .
you just keep us steady , now .
all right .
howard .
yeah?
there's a rather alarming mountain heading our way .
pull back on the wheel a smidge .
go on .
golly !
i don't think i've ever met someone who actually uses the word " golly .
you all right?
do you want me to take over?
just when i'm getting the hang of it?
you want some milk?
oh , please .
utterly smashing !
we'll do it again .
i'm free wednesday .
it's a little early for golf , though .
oh , no , no .
i live right there .
feel like a drink?
lead on .
now , that makes for a challenging par four .
my decorator picked out the wallpaper and such .
he's queer as a bedbug .
but i just hate this room .
gives me the willies .
like i'm about to be swallowed up by the latest issue of town & country .
what room do you like?
my study .
take me there .
you are the tallest woman i know .
and all sharp elbows and knees .
beware .
will you fly me to work tomorrow?
it is tomorrow .
keep your eye on the fuel .
she's got a minimum to keep her weight down .
two runs .
that's it .
after that , you're flying on vapors .
and then you crash and you die .
give her easy flying .
don't worry about speed and don't think about the record today .
i wish you'd let someone else take her .
you've got 20 test pilots .
hell , why should i let someone else have all the fun?
see you in a bit .
contact !
339 .
goddamn !
347 .
son of a bitch !
352 .
352 !
good girl .
damn it !
goddamn it !
oh , god !
there goes our meal ticket .
come on !
howard !
howard !
how did we do?
352 on the last run .
she'll go faster .
country mouse !
kate !
katie !
upstairs , city mouse .
hello .
good lord , what happened to you?
oh , nothing .
a hard landing .
i cut my foot .
sit down .
i'll take care of it .
you tell me everything .
you cannot imagine what it was like , katie .
you cannot imagine the speed .
she was like a winged bullet up there .
what did she make?
oh , around 352 .
you did it !
fastest man on the planet .
hot dog !
i'm so proud of you .
she did it , baby .
you knew she would .
oh , she was fine .
she was just fine .
now let me see your foot .
yeah .
good god !
you're covered in blood .
oh , no .
that's just beet juice .
i crashed into a beet field .
what?
yeah , i crashed in a beet field .
let me get you cleaned up .
heavens , what is this?
electrical tape?
yeah .
odie just sort of slammed it on there .
but all i could think about was getting home to see you .
i am so proud of you .
now , this is gonna sting a little bit .
oh , this is useless .
come to the bathroom .
don't get beet juice on the carpet .
i won't , i won't .
too hot !
don't be a baby .
was the press there?
some .
but they're calling everyone .
should be on the wires by now .
what is it?
kate?
i've been famous , for better or worse ... ... for a long time now ... ... and i wonder if you know what it ... ... really means .
yeah .
i had my fair share of press on hell's angels .
i'm used to it .
are you?
howard , we're ...
we're not like everyone else .
too many acute angles .
too many eccentricities .
we have to be very careful not to ... ... let people in , or they'll make us into freaks .
kate , they can't get in here .
we're safe .
they can always get in .
when my brother killed himself ... ... there were photographers at the funeral .
there's no decency to it .
you know , sometimes i ...
i get these feelings , katie .
i get these ideas , these ... ... crazy ideas about ... ... things that may not ...
things that may not really be there .
yeah .
sometimes i truly fear that i'm ... ... iosing my mind .
and if i did , it would ...
it'd be like flying blind .
you understand?
you taught me to fly , howard .
i'll take the wheel .
smashing all records , howard hughes outdoes jules verne's wildest dreams .
around the world from new york to new york in four days .
even beating wiley post's mark by over three days .
new aviation history is written when his lockheed monoplane ... ... returns swiftly and safely .
a daring aviator .
a true pioneer of the world's airways .
from new york to paris , he cuts lindbergh's time in half .
then on to moscow .
thirty five hours out of new york , he roars across siberia's trackless wastes .
sixty hours out of new york , he heads for alaska , most hazardous hop of all .
continuing the terrific pace , he comes home ... ... bringing new laurels to american aviation .
howard hughes and his crew may find more worlds to conquer ...
you won't believe this .
it just came over the wires .
hughes has bought control of twa .
i thought mr. hughes was flying around the world .
apparently he did it while he was flying , over the radio .
i have heard some disquieting rumors about mr. hughes .
i'd like to know everything there is to know about mr. hughes .
i'd like you to attend to that for me .
thoroughly .
the pantages is glittering tonight .
howard !
right over here .
this way , over to the left .
mr. hughes , how was your flight?
miss hepburn !
when are you gonna name the day?
raise your head .
what's the next movie?
give us the scoop .
right here .
how many more records are you gonna set?
right over here .
come on .
give us a smile .
it won't kill you .
howard , this way .
beautiful .
over here , over here , mr. hughes .
when are you gonna fly around the world again?
you gonna fly with kate next time?
did you get ionely without her?
talk to lindbergh about your flight yet?
where's linda darnell tonight?
please , mr. hughes .
right here .
right here , mr. hughes .
are you trying to be more famous than lindbergh?
you know , fame is supposed to be my turf .
l. b. !
if you don't get more distinguished every time i see you .
you look so beautiful .
is that true?
don't worry about it , howard .
she's just working the room .
it's her job , baby .
sultry southern tigress ava gardner dazzles the room tonight .
she's the newest star in the mgm galaxy .
and believe you me , she puts the " cheese " in " cheesecake .
well , jane eyre has been selling popcorn for over a hundred years , l. b.
hello .
hello .
could you reach me a towel?
i ...
i really can't do that .
i'm sorry .
i'm an idiot .
i'm a complete idiot , and i'm sorry .
forget it .
no , no .
i'm a vain , preening ass ... ... without a single redeeming feature .
that's not true .
you have very good teeth .
come on .
i've got a better idea .
take me flying .
or better yet , i'll take you flying .
do your worst , miss hepburn .
don't be so squirmy .
you're gonna get on famously with father and mother .
and i'm sure they'll like you too .
once they get to know you .
hello !
hello !
kath , hello .
kathy .
who's that with the camera right there?
that's my ex husband , ludlow .
father and mother are just mad about luddie .
what the hell's he doing here?
oh , he's here all the time .
hello !
sorry we're late .
mom .
oh .
oh , thank you .
dad .
darling .
uncle willy .
oh , who have we got here?
don't feel self conscious .
hepburns !
hepburns !
attention , please .
this is howard .
howard , welcome .
don't worry , he's had his lunch .
he likes you .
that's unusual .
we pay our devotion to the arts here .
a colony we created .
julian's a painter .
abstract , of course .
what's the point of painting ... ... something real when you can just take a picture nowadays?
where do you stand on politics , mr. hughes?
excuse me?
we're all socialists here .
we are not .
you've met mr. roosevelt .
what make you of him?
what are you sniggering at?
what?
what was that?
you just sniggered .
no , no .
the dog .
it seems to be crushing my feet .
oh , my god !
buster !
hey .
hey !
don't you like dogs?
i will not have you sniggering at mr. roosevelt .
please leave .
no .
i wasn't .
i thought everybody liked dogs .
perhaps he had a bad experience .
does it upset you that howard gets more press?
a bad experience with a dog?
no , no .
you are such a shy creature , aren't you?
perhaps it was a very large dog .
the press can be a damned nuisance .
was it a doberman?
a doberman , mr. hughes?
or a dachshund?
neither , sir .
dachshunds are little dogs , hep dear .
they should all be lined up and shot .
what's that spanish painting?
the goya .
goya .
of course .
yes .
yes , mexican .
what was that called?
anyway , that's the vulgar press , i'm sure .
do you read much , mr. hughes?
i try to stay up to snuff on the trade journals , yeah .
snuff?
these would be flying magazines?
what was that?
oh , he's a little deaf .
pass the goddamn butter , i beg you .
you read flying magazines?
trade journals .
on engineering .
aviation .
we read books .
howard has to read the trade pieces , mom , because he's designing a new aeroplane .
oh , really?
do tell .
well ... ... it's quite exciting , actually .
it's a spy plane for the air corps .
a twin engine plane with some ... ... i must admit , some rather unique design features .
you see , it has these two booms at the back ...
luddie built a birdhouse once .
you remember that , dear?
yes , well , a mere trifle , darling .
i remember the painting !
the painting , it's called may 18 0 something .
anyway , goya's vastly overrated .
all the spaniards are .
nonsense !
picasso is sacred .
i'm a urologist .
it was quite aesthetic , really .
a sacred monster .
the birds don't care for it much , but the bats do .
i'll bet .
that's such bunk !
do speak up , dear .
nothing , nothing , mrs. hepburn .
nothing .
why did you speak?
i can't abide people who speak but have nothing to say .
did you go to mechanic school to learn all this airplane guff?
no , no , i didn't , luddie .
no .
well , howard just flew round the world in three days .
i think we've had enough about airplanes .
and dogs .
then how did you make all that money?
we don't care about money here .
well , that's because you have it .
would you repeat that?
you don't care about money because you've always had it .
how did you make all that ...?
excuse me , i'm speaking .
okay .
thank you .
all right .
some of us choose to work for a living .
speaking of which , i have more of that airplane guff to attend to .
excuse me .
well , seems a rather high strung chap .
you're a fine bunch of bullies , aren't you?
have you talked to mr. mayer about letting you do jane eyre?
the old philistine won't budge .
too arty , don't you know .
i'm convinced the man hasn't read anything longer than a katzenjammer kids in his life .
no fair , kicking .
you have to use the mallet .
really , darling , you can't retire from the field of battle like that ... ... or they'll never respect you .
katie , i don't understand .
you're like a different person in there .
they just expect me to be a certain way .
there's only one real kate , and that's your kate .
over in hollywood , aviation tycoon howard hughes is cooking up something big .
even as he edits his new picture , he's been secretly meeting with the u. s. air corps .
we applaud his patriotism and look forward to his newest marvel .
you know how many allied ships we lost because of u boat attacks?
no .
six hundred and eighty one ships ... ... just this year so far .
the army needs a new airplane to fly the troops to europe .
these ships , they're sitting ducks for the u boats .
you wanna build a troop carrier plane?
stop thinking like an insect .
not just to carry troops , a plane to carry everything .
the troops and the jeeps and the tanks and whatnot .
here , take a look .
no .
other side .
i figure around 200 feet from nose to tail .
wingspan , around 300 .
we're gonna need about 24, 000 horsepower .
now , this is just what kaiser and the army are looking for .
they're gonna pay for it this time .
what are you getting us into?
well , it's a big plane , so i'm calling it the hercules .
swell name , isn't it?
how heavy you imagine this thing is?
say around 200 tons .
well , i didn't say it was gonna be easy .
all right , boys , i want you to rig up something like this .
should give the proper uplift ratios and reduce need for torque support on the front .
we are not getting enough production out of jane russell's breasts .
i want smooth titties , gentlemen .
smooth titties .
it's all in engineering , isn't it , odie?
howard ... ... do you really think they're gonna let you put out a whole movie just about tits?
sure .
who doesn't like tits?
good afternoon , gentlemen .
sorry i'm late .
please record that mr. hughes has arrived and this session is now called to order .
i yield the floor to mr. breen .
mr. hughes ... ... members of the committee , i've reviewed the photoplay entitled the outlaw ... ... and i can state that i have never seen anything so unacceptable ... ... as the shots of the mammaries of the character named rio .
for almost half the picture , the girl's mammaries , which are quite large ... ... and prominent , are shockingly uncovered .
for this reason , i concluded the picture appeals only to prurient interests ... ... and should be denied the motion picture association's seal of approval .
really , mr. hughes .
thank you , mr. breen .
mr. hughes .
thank you , mr. chairman .
mr. breen .
it's good to see you again .
i haven't seen you all since that situation with all the violence in scarface .
the situation here revolves around miss russell's mammaries .
mr. breen feels that they are too prominent , yes?
more prominent than other mammaries have been up on the screen?
well , i hope to dispel that notion .
jean harlow .
ann sheridan .
irene dunne .
claudette colbert .
rita hayworth .
betty grable .
and the lovely miss jane russell .
now , all these shots , save for miss russell , were enlarged from pictures ... ... that received mr. breen's seal of approval .
now , as you've probably noticed by now , they all contain mammaries .
i will ask my associate to join me now .
may i introduce ... ... dr. ludlow branson of columbia university .
dr. branson ... ... is a mathematician of some note .
yes .
and he will now demonstrate ... ... that in fact ... ... miss russell's mammaries are no more prominent ... ... than any of these other fine ladies '.
doctor .
doctor ... ... you forgot your calipers .
gentlemen , mr. hughes .
let us commence by calling this ... ... mammary exhibit number one .
now , you'll see that the length of the actual cleavage ... ... if i may , is ... ... 5 inches and a quarter .
now if we move to mammary exhibit ...
hollywoodland .
movie tycoon howard hughes must have the greatest job in the land .
every night , the lucky guy escorts a different beautiful woman ... ... to a different dazzling event .
the twa king always talks up his airline as he escorts a succession ...
the hercules , ladies and gentlemen .
the hercules .
a plane , a boat , a flying city .
don't forget , every bill comes to me .
they don't pay for anything .
those men decide whether to fund the plane , so i need them happy .
you do what it takes .
you betcha , boss .
how are the girls in the bomb department?
well , let's put it this way , it'll be a regular boob buffet .
i don't think the air corps men will have trouble scoring .
good .
and inside , 700 brave american soldiers ... ... a dozen sherman tanks all winging their way over the atlantic ... ... free from the threats of the u boats below .
could jules verne himself have ever imagined anything so magnificent?
could he have imagined her mammoth wingspan , longer than a football field?
don't you see how this demeans me?
since when do you care about scandal rags?
every time there's a picture of you with another woman , it's a slap in the face .
don't you understand that?
well , that's overstating it .
joan crawford , ginger rogers , linda darnell , joan fontaine ... ... and now bette davis , for god's sake .
look , they're cracker jack candy , honey .
they don't mean anything to me .
oh , very nice .
you're the one that said that all men are predators .
i mean , it's all in darwin , remember?
and am i to expect this behavior to continue after the wedding?
what is really bothering you , kate?
is it the women or the publicity?
can't you eat ice cream from a bowl like everyone else in the world?
don't you dare .
yeah .
no , odie , this is not a good time .
for chrissakes , we can't make the hercules if we don't have any aluminum .
wait .
i can hear you better now .
tell the war production board ... ... that this is an essential strategic operation .
if they're giving aluminum to boeing , they can give some to hughes aircraft .
don't set the ice cream ...
we gotta think of something else .
if we can't get aluminum , we'll find another way .
you tell me .
we'll find some alloy that works just as well .
right .
look ...
lf we can't get aluminum , we'll use wood .
you can't make a plane out of wood .
why not?
the damn thing is a flying boat , right?
what do they use to make boats?
oak .
and think of the hercules like a flying spanish galleon .
spanish galleons can weigh 1200 tons .
good luck today .
we just have to find the right wood .
something light but strong .
morning , kate .
pine , cedar , maybe birch .
catch .
from my farm .
if you like it , i can get you a bushel .
trouble with mr. hughes?
there's too much howard hughes in howard hughes .
that's the trouble .
beautiful .
don't you take christmas off?
nice to see you .
sorry , i've got grease on my hands .
have we got something to show you .
take a look .
the xf 11 reconnaissance flier .
spy plane , really .
designed every inch of her myself .
she's got a top speed of 450 ... ... which means she can outrun anything they throw against her .
after the japs stole my h 1 design for their zeros ... ... i needed to do them one better .
yeah , she's my buck rogers ship .
she's a looker .
okay , what do you got for me?
jiminy cricket .
seating capacity for 60 .
wingspan , 123 feet .
four double cyclone engines .
her ceiling's 25, 000 feet .
gross weight?
86, 000 , wing loading of 41 pounds .
so less drag on the plane in thinner air .
so high cruise power , you're looking at a top speed of around 340 .
giving her a range of about 3000 miles .
cross country .
nonstop .
bob ... ... you know something?
you are a son of a bitch .
yeah .
bob , you got something on your suit .
yeah .
on your lapel .
you got something on your lapel .
right there , bob .
you missed it .
right there .
clean it off , would you?
here .
thanks .
no , throw it away .
no , over there .
thanks .
so , what do you call her?
the constellation , but we can change that .
no , no .
it's pretty .
i like her .
so , what kind of deal can you give me?
what kind of deal can you give me?
the first 40 planes off the assembly line .
that should give us about two years 'exclusivity .
hell , more than that .
united and american don't have the imagination for a plane like this .
two years ahead of juan trippe , then .
how much?
four hundred and fifty thousand each .
so that's 18 million for the first 40 .
hell , twa can't afford that .
the damn airline's flat broke .
guess i'll just have to pay for them myself .
build them , bob .
send the bill to noah dietrich .
oh , and thank you .
merry christmas .
you've just placed the largest order for airplanes in the history of the damn planet .
lockheed sent us a bill for $ 18 million .
don't get all hysterical on me , noah .
it isn't good for you .
this is a lot of money for planes .
i know it's a lot of money .
it's too damn much .
you think i've got $ 18 million in petty cash?
i should've told you .
it slipped my mind .
slipped your mind?
oh , for ...
right .
i'll get back to you .
bye .
how could $ 18 million slip your mind?
hey , honey .
what are you doing home?
you're not one for tears , and , well ... ... neither am i , so it's best to come out with it .
i've met someone .
i've fallen in love and i'm moving out .
if i could make it any more gentle , i would .
but i can't , so ... ... there we both are .
let's be honest .
it's all been a grand adventure , but it couldn't possibly last .
we're too alike , you and i.
you met someone?
someone more appropriate .
to me , i mean .
what does that mean , " more appropriate "?
someone more attuned to my needs .
look at me , katie .
stop acting .
i'm not acting .
i wonder if you even know anymore .
don't be unkind .
you ...?
you wanna go?
go on .
actresses are cheap in this town , darling .
and i got a lot of money .
this is beneath you .
no , no , this is exactly me .
you tell me you're leaving me , and you have the nerve to expect graciousness?
i expect a little maturity .
i expect you to face the situation like an adult who ...
don't talk down to me !
don't you ever talk down to me !
you are a movie star .
nothing more .
don't answer it .
what is it , howard?
hey , noah ... ... i need you to get to penney's and buy me some clothes .
penney's isn't open .
oh , shit .
it's 2 in the morning .
yeah , that's right .
well , first thing tomorrow , then , all right?
i need two new suits off the rack .
one light and one dark .
three white shirts and three pairs of white tennis shoes .
got that?
yeah .
no , no .
make it woolworth's .
woolworth's .
no , no , penney's .
penney's .
all right .
i'll get into it as soon as i can , howard .
all right?
noah , do you have a recorder?
no .
are you recording this conversation?
no .
okay .
i trust you .
howard ...
i need those suits first thing tomorrow .
all right .
wait .
did i say penney's or woolworth's?
penney's .
better make it sears .
all right , then , sears .
i'm sorry , honey .
if i don't answer , he'll just call back .
stop there , if you please , miss domergue .
have you had surgery , miss domergue?
no .
do you have scars of any kind?
no .
wipe off your lipstick .
that's much better .
now , you understand that you'd be under contract to me?
personally .
do you know what that means?
now turn around for me .
very nice .
you move well .
you live with your family , do you?
yes .
that's nice .
tell me something .
how old are you , miss domergue?
fifteen .
holy mother of god .
well , a car picks me up every morning at 8 , and off i go .
i'm getting my high school diploma .
howard thinks that education is important .
that's right .
and then , after classes ... ... i'm off for elocution and grooming and fittings .
well , blow me down .
pan am's working out of the cocoanut grove?
hello , jack .
hello , juan .
helen , good to see you .
how are you , howard?
good , thanks .
this is faith domergue .
sit down .
pleasure .
what are you doing here?
well , i'm out to meet with douglas about the dc 4 .
it's our new plane , and it is gonna be a pip , let me tell you .
how's the constellation coming?
good .
great .
so how about letting me steal a peek?
i don't think so .
i should be cross with you .
you stole ray loewy from us .
he's doing our interior design .
that's right .
he was doing ours .
so ... ... what are your colors?
stop fishing .
so you have buttons ... ... or zippers?
i'm sorry?
buttons or zippers for the drapes on the sleeping berths?
zippers .
buttons .
so i suppose you'll be expanding on down to mexico .
why do you say that?
well , your range is 3000 miles .
i'd imagine you'd expand from los angeles to mexico and south america .
hey , that's a good idea .
anyone got a pen?
or across the atlantic .
you've had enough of this ice cream .
you give me that spoon .
you don't wanna get your gloves all sticky .
isn't that too far?
new york ... ... to newfoundland ... ... to ireland .
to paris .
well ... ... pan am welcomes you .
we're overbooked as it is .
it's such a burden doing it all on your own , let me tell you .
so when's the connie gonna be ready?
next year maybe .
dc 4?
next year .
well , we look forward to her then .
and i to the connie .
i've ordered the next 40 after you .
it's miss ...?
domergue .
yes , of course .
now , was that a rumba or a samba you were doing?
it was a samba .
a samba , yes .
howard , i never knew you were such a good dancer .
helen , jack .
good going .
you gave away our entire postwar strategy .
he can't stop us .
he's pan am .
he can stop anything .
give me the largest scotch you got .
i don't know what in the hell you're so damn giddy about .
excuse me .
jack .
get in touch with joyce and berg .
those are my boys in washington .
set up a meeting with jones , secretary of commerce , old golfing buddy .
slow down .
we'll need terminals in ireland and france .
i wanna get some tax breaks .
if that ass thinks he owns the world , he's got another thing coming .
pan am owns europe .
we ought to think about mexico .
to hell with mexico .
no airline should have a monopoly on flying the atlantic .
it just isn't fair .
he owns pan am , he owns congress .
he owns the civil aeronautics board , but he does not own the sky .
we're in a street fight with that son of a bitch .
i've been fighting high hat ivy league pricks like him my whole life .
and listen , fire ray loewy .
you goddamn heard me?
fire ray loewy .
he's spying for trippe .
that shitheel knew all about the buttons .
spies in my midst , jack .
spies in my midst .
hello , howard .
roland .
so ... ... what can i do for you?
i want all the pictures you have of kate hepburn and spencer tracy .
all the negatives .
and i want you to kill the story .
howard , he's a married man .
he's a catholic .
they're movie stars .
fair game all around .
my office knows where i am , howard .
i'm not gonna kill you , roland .
i don't do that .
how much?
not for sale .
how much?
not for sale .
you ever cheat on your wife , roland?
you ever screw a colored girl?
you ever steal anything?
you ever hurt anyone?
good night , howard .
you ever go to a communist party meeting , roland?
twa stock .
how much?
fifty thousand shares .
ten .
all right .
this isn't gonna be that easy .
he's been making big contributions on both sides of the aisle .
and jack frye is out there lobbying everybody in town .
the french and british ambassadors are lined up on his side .
i'm telling you , twa is serious about going international .
okay .
point , mr. hughes .
i think it's time for you to introduce the community airline bill ... ... on the floor of the senate .
is it done?
my people are finishing it right now .
i also have to get you on the committee investigating the national defense .
on the committee or chairman?
i could be much more effective as chairman .
it's a great public platform .
you know , it generates a lot of press .
wasn't truman chairman of that committee?
yeah , right .
he's vice president .
look what he did with it .
no , i think ...
i think chairman .
what do you think?
chairman .
that is interesting .
yeah .
let me show you these specs for the dc 4 .
ava , what do you think about trans world airlines?
transcontinental and western doesn't fit anymore .
we're international , we need a name that reflects that .
trans world is good .
kind of peppy .
twa , right?
that way you don't need to repaint any of the planes .
that's you .
always pinching pennies .
hand me my wrap .
knock it off .
i have something for you .
stay here .
what the hell is this?
it's a present .
go on , open it .
oh , a box of trash .
you shouldn't have .
keep looking , keep looking .
it's a kashmiri sapphire .
i had my boys all over the damn globe looking for this .
why?
because .
look .
it matches your eyes .
i am not for sale .
for chrissakes , it's just a present .
you can't buy me , howard , so stop trying .
don't buy me any more diamonds or sapphires or any other damn thing .
you can buy me dinner .
how about that?
jesus , ava .
it's bad enough i have to endure those gym shoes of yours .
but i get all dolled up and we go out in this jalopy without a hood .
ava , will you marry me?
no , howard .
well , why not , for heaven's sake?
in the first place , i don't love you .
in the second place , i'm still married .
look , you got girls stashed all over town .
you got a damn harem just at the bel air .
marry one of your bungalow girls .
those are employees .
i won't marry an employee .
how would that look?
what is going on?
oh , my god !
goddamn it !
faith !
faith , what the hell?
look out !
goddamn , what the hell are you doing?
are you okay , lady?
what are you doing with her?
we are going to dinner .

well , how can they justify it?
it's un american .
brewster is saying that nationalized foreign carriers , like air france ... ... can offer lower rates because they don't have to compete .

i'm not kowtowing to anyone .
