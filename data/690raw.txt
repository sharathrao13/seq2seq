hello .
hi , you must be the teacher .
beth , sarah , this is holly .
juno's protg .
i always thought juno would eat her young .
oh , nice .
i'm well able to handle myself , thanks very much .
i've heard about you .
you're that mentalist that jumps off buildings .
base jumping .
you should try it , seriously .
so you live in america now?
ran out of things to jump off in galway , you know .
i'm always searching for the next big high .
sure you'd know all about that .
sorry?
juno showed me a photo of when you used to climb together .
i found this classic picture .
ah !
oh , no !
oh , no !
look at the state of us !
oh , my god .
that's bad .
sexy !
love each day .
used to be something paul used to say .
anyway ... cheers .
here's to our adventure .
skol .
cheers .
come on , light , you bastard .
so , have you done boreham caverns before?
i saw it in a book once .
it's for tourists .
it's not adventure .
might as well have hand rails and a fucking gift shop .
lf you're a caver , jumper , climber ... .. you just do it and not give a shite .
or the thing that's bigger than you will get you .
you want adventure , holly?
when have i ever let you down?
what?
holly , tomorrow is going to be awesome .
ok?
take this .
you need it .
what about josh , sam?
are you guys still together?
kind of .
sort of .
different ... shifts .
oh , my god .
oh , my jesus !
what do you think , eh?
don't say a fucking word , all right?
it was a christmas present .
shut up .
what about you holly?
got a man?
oh ...
i'm a sports fuck like juno .
what?
rebecca , too , i think .
but when i'm older , l want to have lots of babies .
beth , did sarah tell you that ...
oh !
wakey .
wakey .
i feel like road kill .
give me five minutes .
five minutes .
good morning , my little ones .
wakey , wakey .
good morning .
ls that what you call it?
it's fucking freezing !
holly !
we're leaving at seven .
don't be late .
try that .
the queen is dead .
long live ... the fucking queen .
beth , you're not driving .
lf you drive we'll never get there .
paper , scissors , stone .
come on .
oh , you're a dick .
go on .
ok .
there you go .
no , wait , babe .
best of three .
i'll drive .
right?
ladies , group photo .
you'd better hurry it up .
we're running late .
i look like shit .
we all look like shit .
just give me a smile .
hat?
no hat?
no hat .
no hat , no hat .
all right .
run , run , run , run .
say " sausage " !
sausage !
sarah , slow down a bit .
i'm having fun .
she's having fun .
whoa !
turn , turn , turn there .
let's off road .
great .
you should have some water .
trying to set this watch is impossible .
the buttons are too fucking small .
leave it alone .
why do you wear it , anyway?
my boyfriend gave it to me , it's sentimental .
it's fucking mental .
any guy that gave that to me , i'd dump him .
juno , are you sure this is the right way?
relax , i've never been lost in my life .
marvellous .
so have you done these caves before?
no .
but they are only level two .
quite safe , don't worry .
i wasn't .
the only danger is that i might fall asleep .
boreham caves .
more like boredom caves .
nice parking .
thanks .
this one time in galway . when i free climbed the cathedral , a priest chased me down the whole of the ground floor .
that was brilliant .
i shouldn't have wasted the effort , though .
holly , shut up .
rebecca , leave her alone .
ok , guys , let's get moving .
we're running late .
come on , keep up .
hey , holly , wait up .
move it , short arse .
oi , carter , get to the back .
come on , you lazy bastard .
you finally caught up with me .
juno , are we there yet?
there's a river about half a mile ahead .
when we reach it , we follow it up to the mouth of the cave , ok?
how does she know there's a river up ahead?
i can't hear a thing .
she can probably smell it .
she came up here last week to check the route out .
lt's rule number one file a flight plan and stick to it .
and rule number two?
don't go wandering off .
you think it's dark when you turn out the lights .
well , down there it's pitch black .
you can get dehydration , disorientation ...
yeah , yeah , yeah . .. claustrophobia ...
blah , blah . .. panic attacks , paranoia , hallucinations , visual and aural deterioration ...
hey !
eurgh .
yeah , lovely , holly .
a real kodak moment .
don't touch it .
you wouldn't want to piss it off .
what do you think did that , sam?
a bear?
what is this?
nature detectives?
it could have been big foot .
come on .
sam , stop poking it with a fucking stick .
this is it .
you're having a laugh !
afraid not .
i'm an english teacher , not fucking tomb raider .
you'll be fine .
ok , sarah , beth , you're up next .
sam , stay with becca .
do what she does and you'll be fine .
holly , safety first .
i don't want any stunts this time .
you ok?
see you down there .
no .
make sure your cow's tail is locked there and there .
you hold on to this like that .
look , i have done this before , you know?
i'm only looking after you .
and i appreciate it , in small doses .
you gotta see this place .
it's beautiful !
you won't believe this , beth .
oh , shit !
shit , shit , shit .
oh , my god , i'm gonna die .
ah , piece of piss .
oh , my god !
lt's incredible .
clear !
it's holly .
shit , move !
holly , you do this safely , in order , following my lead .
ok?
take it slow and easy .
juno .
smart arse .
it's ok .
it's ok .
it's ok .
they're gone .
they're gone now .
look .
one bat , two bats .
50 bats .
holly , fuck off .
which way?
there's only one way out of this chamber and that's down the pipe .
ok .
it's a drop .
ok?
holly , chuck us your bag .
oh , my god !
find anything good?
jesus christ !
come on , let's eat .
holly , would you take a break?
i just want to take a few more shots .
this cave is a lot cooler than i thought .
hey?
not hungry .
are you ok?
juno , i won't break .
i'm fine .
i asked you for this .
i know .
um , sarah?
l haven't had a chance to say that i'm ... really sorry i didn't stay around longer after the accident .
anyway ... .. we're all here for you now , ok?
yeah .
look , sorry .
i'm feeling a bit out of it .
it's probably jet lag .
so i'm just going to take a look around , ok?
yeah , ok .
why don't you try and find us the way through , huh?
hey , don't go too far .
what's up with her?
she looks like she's seen a ghost .
she's fine .
i've found the next passage !
that's it?
it's a bit small , isn't it?
hey , hey , hey !
i don't get this .
what?
this is not how i imagined it from reading the book .
that's why i don't trust books .
leaves too much room for interpretation .
something wrong?
no .
it's nothing .
holly : l'm taking point , guys .
careful .
just find the way through .
we'll wait here .
sarah?
shit .
are you still behind me?
yes .
shit !
shit !
sarah?
guys , it's sarah , i think she might be stuck .
l am stuck !
all right , sarah .
calm down , just relax .
i can't fucking relax .
fuck , fuck !
sarah , you have to calm down and the only way you're going to do that is to breathe .
ok , breathe slowly .
just keep breathing .
i can't .
i can't .
i can't fucking breathe .
sarah , ok , listen to me .
just listen to my voice , yeah?
sarah , i'm coming .
i'm coming back .
ok?
ok .
sarah , ok?
listen to me , keep breathing .
ok?
hey .
hey , hey .
ok .
ok .
ok .
look here at me , sarah , hey?
help me .
what are you so worried about , sarah?
look at me .
ok , breathe .
breathe , ok?
hey , hey , hey .
listen to me .
listen to me .
what are you so afraid of?
i can't fucking move !
you can move .
sarah , look at me , look at me .
the worst thing that could have happened to you has already happened and you're still here .
this is just a poxy cave and there's nothing left to be afraid of , i promise .
ok?
ok?
hey .
hey , listen , listen .
listen to me , you'll love this one .
how do you give a lemon an orgasm?
god damn it , let me hear you say it .
how do you give a lemon an orgasm?
what do you do?
you tickle its citrus .
ok , that's better .
come on .
ok , ok .
all right , we're going to move now .
take hold of my arm , all right?
we're going to move slowly .
that's it , grab my arm , ok?
ok , come on .
just slowly .
pull on me , ok?
ok , come on .
the rope bag .
i forgot the rope bag .
ok .
ok , fuck the rope bag .
ok , move , now !
now !
hurry up !
sarah , come on !
sarah , keep hold of the rope !
sarah?
oh , ah .
are you ok?
i'm all right .
juno : ls everybody ok? ls everybody ok?
don't fucking touch me .
rebecca?
i'm here , i'm ok .
beth , are you injured?
no , i'm fine .
nobody move until the dust has settled .
don't worry , juno , we're not going anywhere .
you might be right about that .
jesus .
so what's the story now?
according to the guidebook , this cave system has three ways out .
this is just one of them .
lsn't that right , juno?
juno , that's right , isn't it?
check the book .
i didn't bring it .
what?
no point .
for christ's sake , juno .
l knew it .
i knew this wasn't right .
you filed a flight plan to mountain rescue?
lf we don't report in , they'll come looking for us .
that's how it's supposed to work except i put in a flight plan for boreham caverns and this isn't boreham caverns , is it , juno?
we're in the wrong fucking cave?
holly was right .
boreham caverns was a tourist trap .
don't try and pin this fucking shite on me !
this is not caving .
this is an ego trip .
rebecca , i didn't know this was going to happen .
this is exactly what we believe in .
we said , if there's no risk , what's the point?
don't try and justify this .
where ...
where are we?
it hasn't got a name .
it's a new system .
i wanted us all to discover it .
no one's ever been down here before .
you're fucking kidding me .
oh , god !
how the hell do we get out?
there may not be a way out .
look , there's no going back now .
we have to find a way out of this chamber and keep pushing forward .
what the fuck do you think you're doing?
we all trusted you .
you told me this was going to be good for sarah .
have you any idea what she's been through?
no , cos you couldn't get away fast enough , you selfish cow .
you know what , beth?
we all lost something in that crash .
just get us out of here .
look , cave systems sometimes break ground .
it's a small chance .
but if we stay here , we'll die .
let's go .
wait !
what?
don't move , sam .
just don't move .
stay right there .
oh , shit .
no more .
thanks , beth .
now i know how far down it is .
so , what now?
one of us has to get all the way across there so they can rig a line for you guys .
i have three cams , i need at least three more .
where's the other rope bag?
where is it?
we lost it , when the cave collapsed .
sorry .
help me .
come on , becca .
aargh !
you got it .
come on , come on .
come on , rebecca .
come on , rebecca .
what are you waiting for?
fuck .
are you ok?
what's wrong?
it's nothing .
i'm all right .
ok .
all right , more slack .
more slack , thanks .
fuck !
fuck , fuck , fuck .
ok .
well done .
ok .
throw me the right rope .
ok .
ok .
come on .
yeah !
now , you make it look easy .
yeah , well , you make it look hard .
oh .
don't look down , beth .
keep going .
just keep going .
you're ok .
you're safe .
good .
there you go .
was this about me or you?
it's about us , getting back to what we used to be .
i wanted us to claim this place , name it .
i thought maybe your name .
or maybe yours .
you're doing well .
come on .
come on .
there you are .
come on , give me your hand .
juno?
we'll need everything we've got .
haul it in .
fuck .
yes !
reach .
reach out .
aargh !
juno !
no !
juno , it's ok , we've got you .
ok , pull !
sam !
holly , let me pass .
rebecca , show me your hand .
let go , let go .
what does it mean?
it means we're not the first .
it's a piton , right?
lf cavers were here , there's a better chance of us getting out .
this equipment is at least 1 00 years old .
no one uses stuff like this any more .
besides , if anyone had been down here and made it out , they would have named it already .
becca , are you ok?
i'll live .
holly , how does it look?
lt's tight again , but i can get through .
ok , keep going .
we'll be right behind you .
hey , there's something down here .
guys , it's amazing , but the batteries on our lights will run out .
so i suggest we keep moving .
wait a minute .
wait .
what is it , beth?
juno , light up one of your flares .
we don't have time for this .
just light a flare .
really lovely , beth , but it's fucking useless .
no , look at it .
what do you see?
you've got the mountain , the cave ... and there's two entrances .
you are a fucking genius .
i have my moments .
this means there's another way out?
let's find out .
come on !
bastard !
which way?
holly , give me your lighter .
come on .
here .
fuck !
come on !
come on !
shit !
that one !
hey !
holly !
holly , slow down !
holly !
careful !
daylight !
i can see daylight !
holly !
careful !
slow down !
holly , it's not daylight !
help me !
hold on !
guys !
hold ...
holly !
sam !
get down here !
holly !
holly !
holly !
answer me !
i think i hurt my leg !
don't move !
we're coming down to you .
oh , fuck !
no !
fuck !
someone better get down here !
oh , that's fucking disgusting .
beth !
not here , not now !
we need help .
everybody grab a corner .
we need to move her out of the water .
nice and easy now .
and ... lift !
argh !
you fuckers !
juno , find something to make a splint out of .
it's ok , i've got her .
hey , juno , use one of the ice axes .
you'll be all right , sweetheart .
ok .
sarah !
juno , i'm gonna need your help here .
sarah !
juno !
take hold of her arm .
you'll have to hold her down .
what are you gonna do?
i need to dress the wound and rig up a splint , but i can't while the bone is protruding .
i need to push it back in .
i hate you .
i know .
do it .
bite down on this .
keep hold of her .
just fucking bite down , ok?
go !
come on !
just keep biting down , baby .
come on .
ok , someone get me a medical kit .
ok , ok , ok .
calm down .
it'll be all right .
what are you doing?
i just saw something ahead in the tunnel .
sarah , i promise you , i'm gonna get you out of here .
but i can't do it unless you're with me .
sarah?
sarah !
sarah , look at me .
there's nothing there .
that's the best i can do .
it'll hurt like hell and you can't put any weight on it , but at least you can move .
they combed these mountains centuries ago .
anyone trapped would be a skeleton now .
that is just what it looked like .
what?
sarah thinks she saw someone .
saw what?
i don't think i saw someone , i saw someone .
no , you heard something and saw what you wanted to see .
it's the dark .
it plays tricks on people .
i can describe exactly what i saw .
what did you see?
a man .
i saw a man .
are you sure?
yes !
and it's not the first time .
i thought i saw someone before , but now i'm sure .
look , if there is somebody down here , then maybe they can help get us out .
sarah , there's no one down here .
forget about it !
hey , we have to get holly out of here .
ok?
this is all that matters right now .
beth !
it's ok .
ls it?
fuck !
fuck me .
you've got to keep warm .
why are we walking away?
there was daylight back there .
it wasn't .
it was phosphorus in the rock .
we're two miles underground , the only light down here is ours .
argh !
well , it looked like fucking daylight to me .
right tunnel !
i got you .
ok?
jesus !
what is this place?
holly , where's the infrared button?
dead animals .
hundreds of them .
this is not good , guys .
can we get out of here?
which way?
come on .
i don't know .
what do you mean , you don't know?
there's no breeze .
it could be any one of these tunnels .
take your pick .
oh , fuck it !
hello !
please !
ls there anybody there?
hello !
it's there !
it's up there !
it's there on the roof !
fucking hell , did you see ...?
what the fuck was that?
i don't know !
it moved so fast , i could barely see it !
i've never seen anyone climb like that !
i told you i saw someone !
that was not a human being !
screw this .
let's take our chances and pick a tunnel .
move !
what's happening?
oh , shit !
it's circling us .
where is it?
this way !
move !
holly !
we've got to move .
we've got to move .
come on !
move it !
come on , holly !
move it !
let's go !
juno , the flare !
get rid of it !
fuck !
holly , keep moving , come on !
holly !
holly !
sarah !
holly !
sarah !
sarah !
run !
sarah !
get off !
get away , you fucker !
don't leave me .
oh , fuck .
my battery's gone dead .
where are they?
what's happened to the others?
becca , please say we're gonna get out of here .
ok .
ok .
ok .
go .
go !
mummy .
mummy .
lf you're really ready ...
oh , fuck .
fuck .
turn the light off .
quiet .
sarah !
sarah !
sarah !
it can't see us .
sam?
becca?
becca !
becca !
it's juno .
becca !
the noise she's making , she'll bring every one of those things down on her head .
as long as it's not on mine .
becca !
sam !
sam !
sam !
anyone?
sam !
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
oh ...
i'm sorry .
fuck .
ok .
ok .
ok .
it's all clear .
sam , run !
we heard you crying for sarah .
where are the others?
they ...
they took holly .
beth ...
beth's dead .
sam ... .. what is that thing?
i don't know .
well , it does look human .
come on , we need to find the way out before those things find us .
no .
sam , tell us what we're fighting .
well ... .. they're totally blind .
and judging from what we've seen , i'd say they use sound to hunt with .
like a bat .
and they've evolved perfectly to live down here in the dark .
whatever they are , they go to the surface to hunt .
and they bring their food back down here to eat , through an entrance .
listen , if we can stay quiet enough and evade these fuckers ... .. l think i found the way out .
you think?
the climbing gear we found whoever brought that down here marked their route .
i found those markings .
well , what are we waiting for?
sarah .
i'm not leaving without sarah .
sarah !
oh , god .
oh , god .
oh , god .
no .
sarah ...
i'm getting you out of here .
don't touch me .
don't touch me .
i heard juno calling me .
i'm gonna go and find her , and we're gonna come back and get you out .
no , stay away from her .
what?
she did this to me .
what?
she left me .
no , she didn't .
no .
shh .
sarah ...
don't trust her .
you find your own way out .
it's ok .
it's all right .
i'm not gonna leave you , beth .
i'm not gonna leave you .
i'm not leaving you here , ok?
come here .
beth !
this is juno's .
it's from paul .
oh , no .
sorry .
please ...
oh , that's them .
please , come with me .
please .
sarah ... .. don't leave me like this .
no , please don't ask me to do that .
please .
i can't .
i can't do that .
i can't do that .
please .
ok .
ssh .
