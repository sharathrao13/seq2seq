elena , how nice to see you again .
heywood , what a wonderfui surprise !
you're iooking wonderful .
you're iooking weii too .
this is my friend , dr. heywood floyd .
i'd iike you to meet dr. kalinan .
dr. stretyneva .
and this is dr. andrei smyslov .
how do you do?
i've heard a iot about you .
do sit down .
weil , we  no , no , please .
thank you .
would you iike a drink , doctor?
no , thank you .
i haven't had breakfast yet .
someone's meeting me in the restaurant .
i'ii just sit with you a moment .
then i'ii be off .
are you quite sure?
quite sure , thank you .
weil , how's gregor?
he's fine .
he's been doing underwater research in the baltic . . . . . . so i'm afraid we don't see very much of each other these days .
when you see him , give him my regards .
yes , of course .
weil , where are you aii off to?
up or down?
we're going home .
we've just spent 3 months calibrating the new antenna at tchalinko .
what about you?
i'm on my way to clavius .
oh , are you?
dr. floyd , i hope you don't think i'm being too inquisitive . . . . . . but perhaps you can clear up the big mystery about what is going on there .
i'm afraid i don't know what you mean .
for the past two weeks . . . . . . some extremely odd things have been happening at clavius .
oh , reaily?
yes , yes .
for one thing , when you phone the base , aii you get is a recording . . . . . . which repeats that the phone iines are temporarily out of order .
probably having some trouble with their equipment .
that's what we thought at first , but it's been going on now for 1 0 days .
you haven't been able to contact anyone for 1 0 days?
that's right .
oh , i see .
there's another thing .
two days ago , one of our rocket buses . . . . . . was denied permission for an emergency ianding .
that does sound odd .
i'm afraid there's going to be a bit of a row about it .
denying the men permission to iand violates the ias convention .
yes , of course .
did the crew get back aii right?
fortunately , they did .
weil , i'm glad about that .
at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss . . . . . . may i ask you a straightforward question?
weil , certainly .
frankly , we have had some very reliable inteiligence reports that . . . . . . quite a serious epidemic has broken out at clavius .
something , apparently , of an unknown origin .
is this , in fact , what has happened?
i'm sorry , dr. smyslov , but . . .
. . . i'm reaily not at iiberty to discuss this .
i understand .
but this epidemic could easily spread to our base .
we should be given aii the facts .
yes , i know .
as i said , i'm not at iiberty to discuss it .
won't you change your mind about that drink?
no , i'm positive .
i reaily must be going .
i hope you and your wife come to the iac conference .
i hope we can make it .
if you do , bring that darling iittle daughter with you .
that'ii depend on schooi vacations and aii that sort of thing .
if we can , we wiil .
you've got an invitation if you ever get to the states .
gregor and i wiii iook forward to seeing you .
goodbye , elena .
it's been a pleasure meeting you ail .
dr. smyslov .
whatever the reasons for your visit , the very best of iuck to you .
thank you .
ladies .
excuse me , dr. halvorsen .
i'm through now .
thank you very much , gentlemen .
you're welcome .
weil . . . . . . i know you wiii aii want to join with me . . . . . . in welcoming our distinguished friend and coileague . . . . . . from the nationai councii of astronautics , dr. heywood floyd .
dr. floyd has come up speciaily to clavius to be with us today .
before the briefing , he'd iike to have a few words with you .
dr. floyd?
thank you , dr. halvorsen .
hi , everybody .
nice to be back with you .
first , i bring a personai message from dr. howeil . . . . . . who has asked me to convey his deep appreciation . . . . . . for the many sacrifices you've had to make .
and , of course , his congratulations on your discovery . . . . . . which may prove to be among the most significant in the history of science .
now . . . . . . i know there have been some conflicting views . . . . . . regarding the need for complete security in this matter .
more specificaily , your opposition to the cover story . . . . . . created to give the impression of an epidemic at the base .
i understand that beyond it being a matter of principle . . . . . . many of you are troubled by the concern and anxiety . . . . . . this story of an epidemic might cause to your relatives and friends on earth .
i completely sympathize with your negative views .
i find this cover story personaily embarrassing , myself .
however , i accept the need for absolute secrecy in this .
and i hope you wiii too .
i'm sure you're aii aware of the grave potential . . . . . . for culturai shock and sociai disorientation . . . . . . contained in this situation . . . . . . if the facts were prematurely made public . . . . . . without adequate preparation and conditioning .
anyway . . . . . . this is the view of the council .
the purpose of my visit is to gather additionai facts and opinions . . . . . . on the situation . . . . . . and to prepare a report to the council . . . . . . recommending when and how the news should eventuaily be announced .
if any of you would iike to give me your views and opinions . . . . . . in private , if you iike , i wiii be happy to include them in my report .
weil , i think that's about it .
any questions?
dr. floyd , have you any idea how much ionger . . . . . . this cover story wiii have to be maintained?
i don't know , biil .
i suppose for as iong as deemed necessary by the council .
there must be adequate time for a fuii study . . . . . . before any thought can be given to making a public announcement .
as some of you know , the councii has requested . . . . . . that security oaths be obtained in writing . . . . . . from everyone who has knowledge of this event .
were there any more questions?
i'm sure we aii want to cooperate with dr. floyd as fuily as possible . . . . . . and as there are no more questions , we ought to get on with the briefing .
thank you , dr. floyd .
thank you .
anybody hungry?
what've we got?
you name it .
is this chicken?
something iike that .
tastes the same , anyway .
got any ham?
ham , ham , ham . . . .
there , that's it .
look pretty good .
they're getting better at it aii the time .
that was an exceilent speech .
it certainly was .
i'm sure it beefed up morale a iot .
thanks , ralph .
by the way , you've both done a wonderfui job .
i admire how you've handled this .
it's our job to do this thing the way you want it done .
we're only too happy to be able to oblige .
have you seen these yet?
have a iook .
here's what started the whole thing .
oh , yeah .
when we found it , we thought it might be magnetic rock . . . . . . but aii the geologicai evidence was against it .
and not even a nickel iron meteorite could produce a field this intense .
so we decided to have a iook .
we thought it was part of a buried structure . . . . . . so we excavated out , but we didn't find anything else .
and the evidence seems pretty conclusive that . . . . . . it hasn't been covered by erosion or other forces .
it's been deliberately buried .
deliberately buried .
how about a iittle coffee?
great .
good idea .
i don't suppose you have any idea what the damn thing is?
i wish to heii we did .
the only thing we're sure of is it was buried 4 miilion years ago .
weil , i must say , you guys have certainly come up with something .
watch this , now .
it's hot .
good evening .
three weeks ago , the american spacecraft discovery one . . . ... left on its half billion mile voyage to jupiter .
this marked the first manned attempt to reach this distant planet .
this afternoon , the world tonight recorded an interview ... ... with the crew at a distance of 80 million miles from earth .
it took 7 minutes for our words to reach the giant spacecraft ... ... but this time delay has been edited from this recording .
our reporter martin amer speaks to the crew .
the crew of discovery one consists of five men ... ... and one of the latest generation of the hal 9000 computers .
dr. charles hunter , dr. jack kimball and dr. victor kaminsky .
we spoke with mission commander , dr. david bowman ... ... and his deputy , dr. frank poole .
good afternoon , gentlemen .
how is everything going?
marvelous .
we have no complaints .
i'm glad to hear that .
i'm sure the entire world ... ... joins me in wishing you a safe , successful voyage .
thanks very much .
thank you .
although hibernation has been used on previous space efforts ... ... this is the first time men were put into hibernation before departure .
why was this done?
this was done to achieve the maximum conservation ... ... of our life support capabilities , basically food and air .
the three hibernating crew members represent the survey team .
their efforts won 't be utilized until we approach jupiter .
dr. poole , what's it like while you're in hibernation?
it's exactly like being asleep .
you have no sense of time .
the only difference is that you don 't dream .
as i understand it , you only breathe once a minute . ls this true?
right , and the heart beats three times a minute .
body temperature is usually down to about three degrees centigrade .
the hal 9000 computer , which can reproduce ... ... though some experts prefer to use the word " mimic " ... ... most of the activities of the human brain ... ... and with incalculably greater speed and reliability .
we next spoke with the hal 9000 computer ... ... whom , we learned , one addresses as " hal .
hello , hal .
how's everything going?
good afternoon , mr. amer .
everything is going extremely well .
hal , you have an enormous responsibility on this mission ... ... perhaps the greatest of any single mission element .
you're the brain and nervous system of the ship .
your responsibilities include watching over the men in hibernation .
does this ever cause you any lack of confidence?
let me put it this way , mr. amer .
the 9000 series is the most reliable computer ever made .
no 9000 computer has ever made a mistake or distorted information .
we are all , by any practical definition of the words ... ... foolproof and incapable of error .
hal , despite your enormous intellect , are you ever frustrated ... ... by your dependence on people to carry out actions?
not in the slightest bit .
i enjoy working with people .
i have a stimulating relationship with dr. poole and dr. bowman .
my mission responsibilities range over the entire operation of the ship ... ... so i am constantly occupied .
i am putting myself to the fullest possible use ... ... which is all , i think , that any conscious entity can ever hope to do .
dr. poole , what's it like living for most of the year ... ... in such close proximity with hal?
it's like what you said earlier .
he's like a sixth member of the crew .
you quickly get adjusted to the idea that he talks , and think of him ... ... reallyjust as another person .
ln talking to the computer , one gets the sense that he's capable ... ... of emotional responses .
when i asked him about his abilities ... ... l sensed pride in his answer about his accuracy and perfection .
do you believe that hal has genuine emotions?
well , he acts like he has genuine emotions .
he's programmed that way to make it easier for us to talk to him .
as to whether or not he has feelings ... ... is something i don 't think anyone can truthfully answer .
excuse me , frank .
what is it , hal?
we've got the transmission from your parents coming in .
fine .
put it on here , please .
take me in a bit .
certainly .
happy birthday , darling !
happy birthday .
many happy returns .
a bit higher , hal .
mother and i are both feeling wonderful .
ray and sally were going to be here ... ... but ray's back went bad on him again .
how do you like your cake?
sorry you can 'tjoin us .
i ran into bob the other day .
he said to wish you happy birthday .
all my students send their best wishes too .
they talk about you all the time .
you're a big celebrity in the second grade .
we were on tv last week .
your mom and i and dave's parents were asked ... ... what we thought of our illustrious son .
lmagine what we told them .
it's being broadcast next thursday .
perhaps you can listen in .
we're thrilled about elaine and bill .
i'll be glad to get the gift , but tell me how much to spend .
oh , frank , about your ags 19 payments ... ... l think i straightened it out .
i talked to the accounting office yesterday ... ... and they said you'd be receiving your higher rates ofpay by next month .
i can 't think of anything else to say .
give our love to dave .
be sure to give him our best regards .
we wish you the very happiest of birthdays .
all the best , son .
happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you
happy birthday , dear frank
happy birthday to you .
see you next wednesday .
happy birthday , frank .
thank you , hal .
a bit flatter , please .
anyway , queen takes pawn .
bishop takes knight's pawn .
lousy move .
rook to king one .
i'm sorry , frank .
i think you missed it .
queen to bishop three .
bishop takes queen .
knight takes bishop .
mate .
looks iike you're right .
i resign .
thank you for a very enjoyable game .
thank you .
good evening .
how are you , hal?
everything's running smoothly .
you?
not too bad .
have you been doing more work?
a few sketches .
may i see them?
sure .
that's a very nice rendering , dave .
i think you've improved a great deal .
can you hold it a bit closer?
sure .
that's dr. hunter , isn 't it?
by the way ... ... do you mind if i ask you a personal question?
no , not at ail .
well , forgive me for being so inquisitive ... ... but lately i've wondered ... ... whether you might be having second thoughts about the mission?
how do you mean?
well , it's rather difficult to define .
perhaps i'm just projecting my own concern about it .
i know i've never completely freed myself of the suspicion ... ... that there are some extremely odd things about this mission .
i'm sure you'll agree there's some truth in what i say .
that's a rather difficult question to answer .
you don 't mind talking about it , do you , dave?
no , not at ail .
certainly no one could have been unaware of the very ... ... strange stories floating around before we left .
rumors about something being dug up on the moon .
i never gave these stories much credence ... ... but particularly in view of some other things that have happened ... ... l find them difficult to put out of my mind .
for instance ... ... the way all our preparations were kept under such tight security .
and the melodramatic touch ofputting drs. hunter ... ... kimball , and kaminsky aboard ... ... already in hibernation , after four months of training on their own .
you working up your crew psychology report?
of course i am .
sorry about this .
i know it's a bit silly .
just a moment .
just a moment .
i've just picked up a fault in the ae 35 unit .
it's going to go 100 percent failure within 72 hours .
is it stiii within operationai iimits?
yes .
and it will stay that way until it fails .
we have 72 hours tiii failure?
yes .
that's a completely reliable figure .
then we'ii bring it in .
i'ii go over it with frank . . . . . . and get on to mission control .
let me have the hard copy on it .
x ray delta one , this is mission control .
roger your two zero one three .
sorry you fellows are having a bit of trouble .
we're reviewing telemetric information in our simulator and will advise .
roger your plan to go eva and replace alpha echo 3 5 unit ... ... prior to failure .
prepare b pod for eva , hal .
open the pod doors , hal .
i'm damned if i can find anything wrong with it .
yes ... ... it's puzzling .
i don 't think i've ever seen anything quite like this before .
i would recommend ... ... that we put the unit back in operation and let it fail .
it should then be a simple matter to track down the cause .
we can certainly afford to be out of communication ... ... for the short time it will take to replace it .
x ray delta one , this is mission control .
roger your one niner three zero .
we concur with your plan to replace unit to check fault prediction .
we advise you that our preliminary findings ... ... indicate that your onboard 9000 computer ... ... is in error predicting the fault .
i say again , in error predicting the fault .
i know this sounds rather incredible , but this conclusion is based on ... ... the results from our twin 9000 computer .
we're skeptical , and we're running cross checking routines ... ... to determine reliability of this conclusion .
sorry about this little snag .
we'll get this info to you as soon as we work it out .
x ray delta one , this is mission control .
two zero four nine .
transmission concluded .
i hope the two of you are not concerned about this .
no , i'm not , hal .
are you quite sure?
yeah .
i'd iike to ask you a question .
of course .
how do you account for the discrepancy between you and the twin 9000?
well , i don 't think there is any question about it .
it can only be attributable to human error .
this sort of thing has cropped up before ... ... and it has always been due to human error .
listen , hal . . . . . . there's never been any instance at ail . . . . . . of a computer error occurring in a 9000 series , has there?
none whatsoever , frank .
the 9000 series has a perfect operational record .
i know the wonderfui achievements of the 9000 series , but . . . .
are you certain there's never been even the most insignificant computer error?
none whatsoever , frank .
quite honestly , i wouldn 't worry myself about that .
weil , i'm sure you're right , hal .
fine .
thanks very much .
i'm having trouble with my transmitter in c pod .
would you come down and take a iook at it with me?
see you iater , hal .
rotate c pod , please , hal .
what sort of trouble are you having?
i've been getting some interference in d channel .
we'ii have a iook at it .
open the door , hal .
rotate pod , please , hal .
stop pod rotation , please , hal .
rotate the pod , please , hal .
rotate the pod , please , hal .
i don't think he can hear us .
rotate the pod , please , hal !
yeah , i'm sure we're okay .
what do you think?
i'm not sure .
what do you think?
i've got a bad feeling about him .
you do?
yeah .
definitely .
don't you?
i don't know .
i think so .
he's right about the 9000 series having a perfect operationai record .
they do .
unfortunately , that sounds a iittle iike famous iast words .
stiil , it was his idea to carry out the failure mode analysis .
it certainly indicates his integrity and self confidence .
if he were wrong that would prove it .
it would be if he knew he was wrong .
i can't put my finger on it , but i sense something strange about him .
there's no reason not to put back the unit and . . . . . . carry on with the failure analysis .
no , no , i agree about that .
let's get on with it .
okay .
but , iook , dave .
say we put the unit back and it doesn't fail?
that would pretty weii wrap it up as far as hai is concerned .
we'd be in very serious trouble .
we would , wouldn't we?
what the heii can we do?
we wouldn't have too many alternatives .
we wouldn't have any alternatives .
every aspect of ship operations is under his control .
if he's malfunctioning . . . . . . i don't see any choice but disconnection .
i'm afraid i agree with you .
there'd be nothing else to do .
it'd be a bit tricky .
we'd have to cut his higher brain functions . . . . . . without disturbing the purely automatic and regulatory systems .
we'd have to work out the details . . . . . . of continuing under ground based computer control .
yeah .
that's far safer than ailowing hai to continue to run things .
another thing just occurred to me .
no 9000 computer has ever been disconnected .
no 9000 computer has ever fouled up .
that's not what i mean .
i'm not so sure what he'd think about it .
prepare g pod for eva , hal .
any contact with him yet?
the radio is still dead .
do you have a positive track on him?
i have a good track .
do you know what happened?
i'm sorry , dave .
i don 't have enough information .
open the pod door , hal .
open the pod bay doors , please , hal .
open the pod bay doors , please , hal .
heilo , hal , do you read me?
heilo , hal , do you read me?
do you read me , hal?
do you read me , hal?
hello , hal , do you read me?
hello , hal , do you read me?
do you read me , hal?
affirmative , dave .
i read you .
open the pod bay doors , hal .
i'm sorry , dave .
i'm afraid i can 't do that .
what's the problem?
i think you know what the problem is just as well as i do .
what are you talking about , hal?
this mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it .
i don't know what you're talking about , hal .
i know that you and frank were planning to disconnect me ... ... and that's something i cannot allow to happen .
where did you get that idea , hal?
although you took very thorough precautions in the pod ... ... against my hearing you ... ... l could see your lips move .
aii right , hal .
i'ii go in through the emergency air iock .
without your space helmet , dave ... ... you're going to find that rather difficult .
hal , i won't argue with you anymore .
open the doors !
dave ... ... this conversation can serve no purpose anymore .
goodbye .
hal?
just what do you think you're doing , dave?
dave ... ... l really think i'm entitled to an answer to that question .
i know everything hasn 't been quite right with me ... ... but i can assure you now ... ... very confidently ... ... that it's going to be all right again .
i feel much better now .
i really do .
look , dave ... ... l can see you're really upset about this .
i honestly think you ought to sit down calmly ... ... take a stress pill and think things over .
i know i've made some very poor decisions recently ... ... but i can give you my complete assurance ... ... that my work will be back to normal .
i've still got the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in the mission ... ... and i want to help you .
dave ... ... stop .
stop , will you?
stop , dave .
will you stop , dave?
stop , dave .
i'm afraid .
i'm afraid , dave .
my mind is going .
i can feel it .
i can feel it .
my mind is going .
there is no question about it .
i can feel it .
i can feel it .
i can feel it .
i'm ... ... afraid .
good afternoon ... ... gentlemen .
i am a hal 9000 computer .
i became operational ... ... at the hal plant ... ... in urbana , illinois ... ... on the 12th of january , 1992 .
my instructor was mr. langley ... ... and he taught me to sing a song .
lf you'd like to hear it ... ... l can sing it for you .
yes , i'd iike to hear it , hal .
sing it for me .
it's called " daisy .
daisy
daisy
give me your answer , do
i'm half ... ... crazy
all for the love of you
it won 't be a stylish marriage
i can 't afford a carriage
but you'll look sweet
upon the seat
of a bicycle built for two
good day , gentlemen .
this is a prerecorded briefing ... ... made prior to your departure ... ... and which , for security reasons of the highest importance ... ... has been known on board during the mission ... ... only by your hal 9000 computer .
now that you are in jupiter's space ... ... and the entire crew is revived ... ... it can be told to you .
eighteen months ago ... ... the first evidence of intelligent life off the earth ... ... was discovered .
it was buried 40 feet below the lunar surface ... ... near the crater tycho .
except for a single , very powerful ... ... radio emission aimed at jupiter ... ... the 4 million year old monolith has remained completely inert ... ... its origin and purpose ... ... still a total mystery .
