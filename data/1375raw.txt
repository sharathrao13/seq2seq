i can't help it .
i can't stop him from anything .

i can't talk to him .
he won't listen to anybody .
he's been crazy all summer .
he's tried to kill me since june .
he put a gun to my head .
and he cut me with a knife .
he beat up my friends .
did you contact the police?
what good would that do?
it'd just make him mad .
they don't know him .
it wouldn't stop him .
somebody's got to stop him .
you don't understand .
he's crazy .
he's got a wife , children .
he's a wonderful father .
his mother . . . . . . you should see her .
together with his father , they're like a car wreck .
it just rolls off his back .
he sees them .
he pays the rent .
unbelievable !
i was the one that wanted to get married .
he didn't really want it . . . . . . but he did it .
i don't know why .
why did you want to get married?
i thought it would help me .
but it didn't .
i was so confused .
i was doing . . . . . . insane things .
what sort of things , leon?
after the wedding . . . . . . i ran off for 1 0 days to atlantic city .
sonny was frantic .
he knew i'd been drinking .
he didn't know where i was , who i was with .
i couldn't explain the things i did .
so i went to a psychiatrist . . . . . . who told me . . . . . . that i was a woman trapped in a man's body .
so right away he wanted to give me money for the sex change operation .
but where was he going to get it? $2, 500?
my god , he was in hock up to his ears already .
he needed the money for your operation?
it drove him crazy .
he would fly into these rages .
and i got more depressed than ever .
i knew i'd never get my operation .
so i tried to kill myself .
i took about a half a pound of pills .
blues , yellows , screamers , uppers , downers , you name it .
and i wound up in the hospital .
and sonny comes there . . . . . . and he just looks at me .
and he says . . . . . .
why , leon?
when things were going so good?
don't you think . . .
. . . he did it for you?
yeah , i guess so .
don't you think you owe it to him to try to get him out?
i can't talk to him .
you're up to your neck in it .
you're an accessory .
they can't hold me responsible .
wait , you could help us a little .
i'm afraid .
just talk to him for a minute .
how can he hurt you on the phone?
i can't .
i don't know what to . . . .
just talk with him on the phone .
you think about it .
he won't talk to you .
what do you mean he won't talk to me?
i'll work on it .
i thought you were doing that .
he won't talk to me .
