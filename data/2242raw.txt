excuse me , mr. filby !
i say , it's outright rude of him !
he's merely been detained .
this is such a lost of time !
lf he's not coming , i have more important things to do .
well , speak up .
what is it , woman?
well , are we or are we not invited for dinner?
apparently we are .
how long has he been gone?
i'm not certain , sir .
several days .
i've hardly seen him for some time .
he never leaves the lab .
he only comes in and picks at his food .
but he did tell me about dinner , and left those instructions .
thank you , mrs. watchett .
what's it say , filby?
what's wrong?
nothing , really .
george says that if he's not here by 8 , we're to begin without him .
walter , what time is it?
dinner is served , gentlemen .
first sensible thing i've heard all evening .
this is peculiar .
he's usually prompt , precise and punctual .
he's making fools of us by not showing up .
it's ungentlemanly .
to say nothing of a waste of time .
yes .
a waste of time .
one thing i like about george : best cellar in england .
and mrs. watchett is the finest cook in the world .
yes , i think i'll drink to that .
good lord !
what's happened?
i'm all right .
some food .
a drink .
i didn't recognize you .
mrs. watchett .
can't you speak?
what happened to you?
leave him alone .
it's fine .
i've got to tell it while i remember .
relax .
try to relax .
you've all the time in the world .
you're right , david .
that's exactly what i have .
all the time in the world .
since we were together five days ago . . . . . . the last day of 1 899 .
there in that box rests the result of two years 'labor .
i wanted to finish the job before the new century began .
i barely made it .
cheers , gentlemen .
marvelous , old boy .
yes , but what is it?
well , it has to do with time .
i've always maintained that this nation . . . . . . needs a reliable timepiece .
the navy needs one .
the army needs one for the artillery .
you couldn't do better , george .
that's why you've been in hiding?
very clever of you , indeed .
i don't think george is referring to a new timepiece .
no , david .
when i speak of time , i'm referring to the fourth dimension .
go on , george .
the fourth dimension cannot be seen or felt .
lf you don't mind , will you refresh me on the first three dimensions?
really , filby .
surely they taught you something in school .
suppose you explain it , doctor .
certainly .
for example , when i move in a line , forward or backward . . . . . . that's one dimension .
when i move left or right , two dimensions .
when i move up or down . . . . . . three dimensions .
for instance , that box .
length , breadth and height .
what is the fourth dimension?
that's mere theory .
no one knows if the fourth dimension exists .
on the contrary .
the fourth dimension is as real and true as the other three .
ln fact , they couldn't exist without it .
what do you mean?
let's take that box .
it has the first three dimensions .
what's inside?
i'm coming to that .
let's consider this first .
why do we ignore the fourth dimension?
because we can't move within it .
up , down , forward , sideways , backward .
but when it comes to time , we are prisoners .
do you follow me , bridey?
no .
you've given a lucid explanation but i'm afraid i don't understand .
there are many things you don't understand , yes?
quite a number .
yet you don't refuse to believe in them?
not if i can see the proof myself .
good , walter .
gentlemen , all i'm asking you . . . . . . is to witness a demonstration of movement . . . . . . within the fourth dimension .
doctor , can i have your help?
certainly .
it's beautiful !
remarkable .
very nice , george .
fascinating .
what is it?
this is only an experimental model .
to carry a man , i need a larger one .
to carry a man?
where?
lnto the past or into the future .
this is a time machine .
you've had your joke .
tell us what this contraption is for .
i've already told you .
the larger model can carry a passenger through time .
not through space , but through time .
lf you go to the future , won't you mess things up for us?
the future's already there .
it cannot be changed .
i wonder .
that's the most important question i hope to answer .
can man control his destiny?
can he change the shape of things to come?
lf you've gone mad , i forgive you .
but if you're wasting our time  no !
you're here as witnesses .
to see , not to listen .
to see?
what?
the experiment i'm about to perform .
let me tell you how it works .
the time traveler sits in the saddle .
ln front are the controls .
let's do this properly .
you can spare a cigar , i trust?
let us imagine that this cigar . . .
. . . is the time traveler .
the lever in front of him controls movement .
forward pressure sends it into the future . . . . . . backward pressure , into the past .
the harder the pressure , the faster it travels .
our little experiment can be performed only once .
lf it succeeds , i lose my model .
that's why i need witnesses .
go ahead , george .
ready , gentlemen?
lend me your hand , please .
i'll be damned !
it worked .
where did it go?
go?
nowhere , in the usual sense .
it's still here .
but it's no longer in the present .
it's traveling through time .
to the future , to be exact .
you expect us to believe that?
certainly .
you said it hadn't really moved .
that's correct .
then why can't we see it?
because we're in this room on december 31 , 1 899 . . . . . . but the model is perhaps a hundred years away by now .
this house may not be here in 1 00 years .
but the time machine occupies the same space . . . . . . as before its journey .
lf it's occupying the same space , why can't i feel it?
the space you're putting your hand through is today's space .
you can't put your hand into tomorrow's space .
space doesn't change !
the same space that's here now should be here forever .
no , philip , time changes space !
this flat ground could've been at the bottom of the sea long ago .
a million years from now , it could be the interior of a huge mountain .
lf all this is true , what do you expect to do with such a contraption?
contraption?
i intend taking a journey into the future .
or perhaps the doctor would volunteer to go?
well , look here , george . . . . . . suppose you do go off to the 50th century . . . . . . how will you get back?
that's a risk i'm ready to take .
now , look here , george .
i don't know what you think , but we're not fools !
we're practical businessmen .
even if you had invented a time machine , what of it?
what's its use?
who'd buy it?
how much would it cost?
have you thought of the commercial possibilities?
no , i haven't .
george . . . !
there's a war on in south africa .
the boers are putting up a fight .
the country needs inventors like you .
i can put you in touch with the war office .
what do you think , david?
dr. hillyer has a good point , george .
that's more sensible .
i'll see to it right away .
good lord !
it's time to go .
yes , i'm sure we all have plans for tonight .
are you all right , george?
yes , i'm all right .
coming , bridewell?
thanks for coming .
good night .
happy new year .
happy new century , george .
good night .
happy new year !
i thought i'd better stay .
you shouldn't trouble yourself .
i'm all right .
no , you're not .
you've been behaving oddly for over a month .
i'll leave , once you tell me what's on your mind .
i appreciate the gesture .
i just want to be left alone .
you've changed , george .
enormously .
i'm sorry .
will you answer me one question , honestly?
yes , i'll try .
why this preoccupation with time?
why not?
don't go simple on me .
the truth is , i don't much care for the time i was born into .
people aren't dying fast enough .
they call upon science . . . . . . to invent new , more efficient weapons to depopulate the earth .
and i agree with you .
i agree , but here we are and we have to make the best of it .
you may have to .
i don't .
all right .
take your journey on your contraption .
what would you become?
a greek?
a roman?
a pharaoh?
i prefer the future .
you're not seriously saying you can do it?
you saw the experiment , didn't you?
i saw a toy machine vanish .
i'm sure there are any number of ways of doing that trick .
any magician could probably do it .
it wasn't a trick !
want to see the full scale model?
no , i don't .
i have no desire to tempt the laws of providence .
and i don't think you should .
it's not for man to trifle with .
you carry on like hillyer and kemp .
there's something to say about their common sense attitude .
i speak to you as a friend .
more .
as a brother .
lf that machine can do what you say it can , destroy it .
destroy it before it destroys you !
you must have plans for new year's eve .
don't let me keep you .
mary wasn't well .
we thought we'd stay home with the baby .
why not come home with me?
you haven't seen jamey for a while .
i'm sorry , i can't .
what's stopping you?
i just want to see the old century out by myself , that's all .
have it your way , george .
will you promise you'll not go out of the house tonight?
i promise i won't walk out the door .
i'm sorry .
please don't think me unkind or unfriendly .
come over to dinner friday .
very well .
fine .
bring the others with you .
as you say , george .
happy new year .
happy new year , david .
having supper in tonight , sir?
i don't think so .
why don't you go and celebrate?
thanks , but if you don't need me , i'll turn in earlier , if i can .
good night , sir .
good night .
mrs. watchett , i invited mr. filby and the others to dinner friday .
happy new year , mrs. watchett .
at first , i pushed the lever forward very slightly ... ... and the laboratory grew faint around me .
i stopped .
no change .
everything exactly as before .
no !
the clock said 6 : 31 when i started , and now it was ... 8 : 09?
and the candle , shorter by inches .
yet by my watch , which was with me , only a few seconds had passed .
it was disconcerting to see the sun arc in less than a minute .
to see a snail race by .
flowers flinging wide their petals to embrace the day .
the hours speeding across my sundial .
flowers closing their eyes for the night .
it was wonderful !
changes that normally took hours took seconds .
dear mrs. watchett ... ... always able to suggest a tie ... ... but never wearing anything more stylish ... ... than what she's worn for years .
yet i was traveling very slowly .
what if i went faster?
it became intoxicating .
i pushed the lever on toward even greater speed .
i gained experience with it .
i could stop for a day , an hour , or even a second to observe .
then go ahead a year or two .
i was able to see the changing world in a series of glimpses .
good heavens .
that's a dress?
this was intriguing .
i wonderedjust how far women would permit this to go .
i began to grow very fond of that mannequin .
maybe because , like me , she didn 't age .
thirteen years passed .
fourteen , fifteen , sixteen ....
suddenly the light was gone .
what had happened?
in the year 1917 , i stopped .
filby !
are you going to a masquerade party?
you look rather silly without your mustache .
were you addressing me , sir?
it's george !
i expected a more enthusiastic greeting
you're confusing me with my father .
there was quite a resemblance .
i'm james filby .
was "?
were you a friend of father's?
yes .
yes , i've been away .
he was killed in the war .
a year ago .
i'm so sorry .
and the gentleman across the street?
oh , the inventor chap?
he disappeared around the turn of the century .
lf you're interested in that house , you can't buy it .
you can't even get inside .
why?
my father was executor of the estate and refused to liquidate it .
i often chided him on that . . . . . . but he believed the owner would return some day .
people hereabouts think it's haunted , but . . . .
who are you , sir?
just a stranger who once knew your father .
have you been at the front?
front?
what front?
the war , of course .
what war?
good heavens !
you don't know we've been at war with germany since 1 91 4?
i thought you'd just returned from france .
or perhaps . . . .
perhaps some tea might make you feel better .
won't you come in?
no , thank you .
are you sure you're all right?
yes , i'm quite all right .
then goodbye , sir .
goodbye , jamey .
in 1940 , i began to be buffeted from side to side .
i first thought the machine had a mechanical defect .
the last time i had stopped was in 1917 , 23 years ago .
the war was still waging .
now in the air with flying machines .
then i realized the truth .
this was a new war .
i decided to push into time and see the outcome of this .
my house was hit !
the flames shot up .
instantly , my home was gone .
i was in the open air .
the years rolled by , everything unfamiliar .
except the smile of my never aging friend .
what was this?
weird sounds all around .
what could it be?
my curiosity compelled me to stop .
at first i wondered if i was the cause of the panic .
i was soon to find out i wasn 't .
keep it moving !
shove it on !
come on , into the shelter .
come on , young man !
come on !
filby?
the name is mr. filby .
didn't you hear the siren?
the horrible screeching?
it wasn't constructed for aesthetic value . . . . . . but to warn young fools to get into shelter .
now , come along .
i'm perfectly comfortable here .
i've got to talk .
this is fantastic !
your store is magnificent !
the achievements !
the gigantic strides man has taken !
come along , young man !
the mushrooms will be sprouting !
mushrooms?
you look familiar .
haven't we met somewhere before?
lndeed we have , mr. filby .
right there .
many years ago .
i was sure of that .
but the exact time escapes me .
it was two wars ago .
1 91 7 .
now i recall .
the chap who inquired about my father . . . . . . and the house that used to stand across the way .
but no . . . .
no , that's impossible !
you haven't changed .
you're not a day older .
and your clothes !
don't worry , filby .
it'll take time to explain , but
that's the last alert !
hurry !
hurry !
listen , this is important .
look !
an atomic satellite , zeroing in .
that's important .
but i've got to talk to you !
come on !
hurry !
hide till the all clear !
but , filby , i've got to talk to you !
the labor of centuries , gone in an instant .
mother earth , aroused by man 's violence ... ... responded with volcanic violence of her own .
only my speed through time saved me from being encased in stone .
the molten rock cooled .
i prayed ... ... wondering how many eons must pass ... ... before the wind and rain could wear away the mountain .
darkness .
darkness for centuries .
i wondered if there was still a war being waged above me ... ... if man would still exist when i saw the sun again .
the centuries rolled by .
i put my trust in time ... ... and waited for the rock to wear down .
i was free again !
thousands of centuries passed but the earth stayed green .
there was no winter , no wars .
had man learned to control both the elements and himself?
i had to stop and find out .
but i'd stopped too fast .
magnificent !
beautiful flowers everywhere !
natural splendor beyond compare .
the whole landscape a garden without any weeds or briars .
trees and vines laden with fruit of strange shapes and colors .
nature tamed completely ... ... and more bountiful than ever !
at last i'd found a paradise .
but it would be no paradise if it was mine alone .
unrepaired for centuries .
maybe unlived in for as long .
anybody here?
so this is man 's future : to bask in the sun , bathe in the streams ... ... and eat the fruits of the earth , work and hardship forgotten .
well , and why not?
don't just sit there !
help her !
are you all right?
thank you .
why did you?
why did i what?
come after me .
sit down .
i did it to save your life .
that doesn't seem to mean much to you , or anybody else .
it doesn't .
twenty of your friends were watching you drown .
not one lifted a finger to save you .
that's a very curious attitude .
a very curious world .
aren't you interested in who i am?
where i come from?
should i be?
take me to somebody a little older .
somebody i can talk to .
there is no one older .
do you mean nobody ages in this land of yours?
what's your name?
weena .
how do you spell it?
spell?
spell , write .
can't you write?
look .
what are your people called?
eloi .
come .
we must go now .
what's wrong?
it's getting dark .
i don't mind telling you , i'm quite hungry .
i've come a long , long way .
ln my time , a berry that size . . . . . . would've been big news all over the world .
excuse me , sir .
sir?
perhaps curiosity has died .
perhaps . . . . . . courtesy too , but i've come far and i'd like to know things .
why?
because i shall return to my time , and my people will ask questions .
what kind of government rules your world?
we have no government .
well , you must have a body of men who pass and enforce laws .
laws?
there are no laws .
where do you get food and clothing?
doesn't anybody work?
no .
where does that come from?
it grows .
it always grows .
i know , but it must be . . . . . . cultivated and planted and nurtured . . . .
well , unless you . . . .
you have an economy so well developed that you can spend all your time . . . . . . studying and experimenting?
ls that right?
you ask many questions .
that is the only way man has learned and developed .
i wish to learn .
i want to learn about your civilization .
do you have books?
books?
yes , we have books .
wonderful !
i can learn about you from books .
they'll tell me what i want to know .
could i see the books?
yes , they do tell me all about you .
what have you done?
thousands of years of building , rebuilding , creating and re creating . . . . . . so you can let it crumble to dust !
a million years of sensitive men dying for their dreams .
for what? !
so you can swim and dance . . .
. . . and play !
you !
all of you !
i'm going back !
i won't bother to tell of the useless struggle . . . . . . the hopeless future .
but at least i'll die among men !
weena , what are you doing?
i came to warn you .
how do you open that panel?
no one can .
only the morlocks .
who are the morlocks?
they give us our food and clothes .
we must obey .
why'd they take my machine?
you've got to tell me !
we mustn't be out in the dark .
only children are frightened by the dark .
you are a child , aren't you?
i'll light a fire .
please , let us go .
my machine is inside .
i must find a way to get it out .
no , you mustn't .
help me gather some wood .
that's a girl .
where are you from?
as a matter of fact , i'm from right here .
that's where my house used to be . . . . . . many thousands of years ago .
you see there?
up to those panels was my laboratory .
beyond them was where my garden used to be .
right there .
that was my library .
where i once sat talking with friends about . . . . . . the time machine .
you know , weena . . .
. . . l'd hoped to learn such a great deal .
i hoped to take back the knowledge and advancement man had made .
lnstead , i find vegetables .
the human race reduced to living vegetables .
they're gone .
are you all right?
was that a morlock?
yes .
don't you worry .
the fire seems to keep them away .
what are you doing?
why did you put your hand there?
i never saw it before .
no knowledge of fire .
no books .
i'm terribly sorry .
i had no right to be angry with your people .
no more than if i'd visited the island of bali in my own time .
but , you know , weena . . . .
you were safe inside your house , yet came out to warn me .
the characteristic which distinguished man from animals . . . . . . was the spirit of self sacrifice .
and you have that quality .
so do all your people .
it just needs someone to reawaken it .
i'd like to try , if you'll let me .
will you?
i do not understand . . .
. . . but i believe you .
that's as good a start as any .
try to tell me .
the morlocks who or what are they?
are they animals or people?
well , what about yourself?
don't your people ever speak of the past?
there is no past .
well , do they ever wonder about the future?
there is no future .
the past . . . . . . man's past . . .
. . . is mainly a grim struggle for survival .
but there have been moments when a few voices have spoken up . . .
. . . and these rare moments have made man's past . . . . . . a glorious thing .
i refuse to believe it's dead and gone .
we've had dark ages before .
this is just another one .
all it needs is someone to show you the way out .
i'm only a mechanic , but . . . . . . l'm sure there must be that spark in one of you .
lf only i can kindle that spark . . . . . . my coming here will have meaning .
my efforts to open the panel were fruitless .
i had to find another way to retrieve my machine .
listen .
do you hear that?
yes .
machines?
no , morlocks .
wait .
those animals run machines?
they are morlocks .
have you ever seen the machines?
no , only heard of them .
who told you?
the rings .
what sort of rings?
rings that talk .
could you show me these rings?
come , this way .
these are the talking rings?
yes .
they speak?
of what?
things no one here understands .
make it talk .
now in its 326th year , the war between the east and west ... ... has at last come to an end .
there's nothing to fight with and few left to fight .
the atmosphere has become so polluted with germs ... ... that it can no longer be breathed .
there is no place left that is immune .
the last factory for the manufacture of oxygen has been destroyed .
stockpiles are rapidly diminishing ... ... and when they are gone , we must die .
my name is of no consequence .
you should know that i am the last who remembers how each of us ... ... man and woman , made his own decision .
some chose to take refuge in the great caverns ... ... and find a new way of life below the earth 's surface .
the rest of us decided to take our chances in the sunlight ... ... small as those chances might be .
from the talking rings i learned how the human race divided ... ... and how the world of the eloi and the morlocks began .
by some awful quirk of fate ... ... the morlocks became the masters and the eloi their servants .
the morlocks maintained them and bred them like ... ... like cattle ... ... only to take them below when they reached maturity .
which explained why there were no older people .
i knew i must go below .
it was the only way to reach my machine ... ... and discover what happened to the older people .
don't go !
you won't come back !
i'll be back .
weena?
answer me !
where are you?
what's happening?
what's happening?
what's the matter with you all?
weena , stop !
stop !
what happens to them?
don't stand there like fatted cattle !
will you answer me?
what is wrong?
nothing is wrong .
it is all clear .
what do you mean , all clear?
all clear .
ln the mid 1 900s , the bombs , the people calling out , " all clear !
no !
that's gone !
that's passed !
there's no more flying machines !
no bombs !
no more wars !
the rings have told us that story .
but you didn't listen !
you didn't learn !
it was ages ago that men were taught to hide when the sirens blew . . . . . . to run from death , but it's over !
those men and those who slaughtered them are dead !
but there is nothing to fear .
it is all clear .
what about the ones who went below?
how will they come back?
they never come back .
nobody can bring them back .
you can try .
you can try !
won't even one of you try? !
well , i'll try !
so this was the destiny of the eloi .
cannibalism !
wake up !
come to your senses !
all of you !
burn .
give me something to burn .
it's my last match .
get up the stairs !
that's the way out !
the torch !
get the torch !
get up the steps !
hurry up !
gather all the deadwood !
all the wood !
that's fine .
come on , throw it down !
all the deadwood !
throw it down !
do the same to the other wells !
all the wood down the wells !
all right , to the river !
back to the river !
all right , let's go !
another night was coming , but this night no eloi needed to fear .
the underworld of the morlocks was gone ... ... and so was the life of leisure for the eloi .
but then what of me?
i was imprisoned in a world ... ... in which ijust did not belong .
are you sorry?
sorry?
sorry for what?
that you have to stay?
yes .
i could tell so much to the people of my time .
i'd let them know . . . . . . about the sorrow and happiness that the future holds .
maybe they could learn from it .
or could they?
you don't want to stay , do you?
it isn't that .
it's just that i don't fit here any more than you would in my time .
i would love to see your time .
you wouldn't be very happy there .
do you have someone there?
someone like me?
no one like you .
i have friends who will miss me , of course .
i'm probably late already .
women?
no .
there is one woman .
she looks after my house for me .
she's 62 years old and all wrinkled .
how do they wear their hair?
who?
the women of your time .
up .
up?
up how?
i don't know .
kind of . . . . . . up , like that .
show me !
would i be pretty?
yes , you would .
very pretty .
i wish we could go back to my time .
or even before that , when the world was young .
we could be so very happy .
look !
my machine !
come on , weena !
i was going the wrong way !
back !
i had to go back !
it's the most ridiculous story i've ever heard .
preposterous !
george , you always could tell a good yarn .
you're a truly great inventor , george .
i think you ought to retire , sir .
truthfully , george , where have you been the past week?
don't ask such questions .
it is not hard for a man to lose a week now and again .
i can understand your doubt .
take it as a lie if you wish .
i scarcely believe it myself , now that i'm back .
david , there's the flower weena gave me .
a present for you .
you're interested in botany .
try to match that with any known species !
i don't think i can .
time to go , bridewell .
yes , it is getting late .
good night , george .
good night , george .
you look exhausted .
you really should get some rest .
good night .
it's grand having you back .
goodbye , david .
thanks for being such a good friend .
always .
what do you think , filby?
one thing is certain .
that flower couldn't bloom in the wintertime .
you don't really believe that story?
good night .
go on , driver .
mr. filby , what?
he's gone !
why , look !
i think i understand .
you see the imprint?
this is where it originally stood .
the morlocks moved it .
they dragged it across the lawn . . . . . . right into the sphinx .
right there .
weena was standing here when he last saw her .
right here !
the same space in a different time .
he dragged his heavy machine back in here . . . . . . scratching the floor . . . . . . so he could appear outside the sphinx again . . . . . . and help the eloi build a new world .
build a new world for himself .
right where he left her .
yes .
it's not like george to return empty handed .
to try to rebuild a civilization without a plan .
he must have taken something with him .
nothing .
except three books .
which three books?
i don't know . ls it important?
i suppose not .
only . . . . . . which three would you have taken?
do you think he'll ever return?
one cannot choose but wonder .
you see , he has all the time in the world .
