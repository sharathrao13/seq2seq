judy baumer's going as a twirler .

peter pan's a boy .
tinkerbell's a girl .
phillip could go as peter pan .
phillip could go as a bump on a log .

no !
i'm bleeding !

what's your name , boy?
phillip .
okay , phillip , reach down and pick up that pistola for me .

shut your mouth !
pick it up and bring it over to me .
point it at me .

it's all right .

shut up !
i vote we take her .

then how are we gonna get out of here?
the whole neighborhood's awake !
we'll take the boy .
no !
ain't you folks ever heard of sleeping in?
i got it , sir .
press has been waiting almost an hour , red .
i hear you .
yeah , i hear you .
i understand .
i understand .
yeah .
no , i'm here .
i'm just listening .
yeah , okay .
what'd he say?
who?
the governor , red .
well , he reminded me that it's an election year .
hi .
hi .
i hope you don't drink before noon .
oh , no , i don't .
the last one we had here , seemed like she was on a liquid diet .
last what?
secretary .
penny monroe .
i believe you have me confused .
see , i'm from huntsville .
i was assigned by the governor .
adler , what is this?
it rings a bell .
i think they sent something over about her this morning .
who did?
the governor , red .
i'm sally gerber , criminologist with the state prison system .
tom adler , texas rangers .
hi .
well , it's a new procedure .
i was assigned by the governor to work
work with state law officials in all affairs of penal matters . . . . . . with the police . " this doesn't say anything
it includes parole , as well as penal escape situations .
we'll be right there , marge .
they're getting antsy , red .
you scheduled it .
the idea is that an understanding of case history . . . . . . should , in parole situations , help the subject to avoid habitual traps .
and in penal escape situations . . . . . . could identify those selfsame traps as an aid to apprehension .
let me tell you , miss gerber . . . .
sally is fine .
let me tell you , sally . . . . . . this is not an escape .
this happens to be a manhunt .
and no talking around in circles is gonna fix that .
and what will?
us having a nose like a blue tick . . . . . . that's a medulla with an antenna , and a lot of coffee .
we got a handful of caps , and you're shooting water tanks .
he's a smart guy , huh , phillip?
goddamn !
okay , boys , that's enough !
the chief's got work to do !
did the kid say anything?
good morning , red .
good morning .
so , what do you think?
looks good .
we're very proud of this baby .
governor ordered it for the parade in dallas .
you know president kennedy's coming?
yeah , so i heard .
latest technology .
got an oversized engine . . . . . . full kitchen , sleeping quarters .
got room for gun racks .
stove , fridge , even got a phone to the governor's office .
fine piece of machinery .
and . . . . . . once it's back , it'll be at your disposal .
it's perfect for lots of situations .
it's a headquarters on wheels .
we'll take it .
chief?
stop taking pictures !
it's just not possible .
governor's gotta ride in it tomorrow .
he gave this manhunt top priority .
but , red listen , you gotta believe me .
red?
what's your name?
dick suttle , the driver .
not anymore .
bradley?
this man stays with his vehicle .
you know how to work all the gadgets?
oh , yes , sir .
okay , take a seat .
excuse me , red .
this here's bobby lee .
he's a specialist with the feds .
they want him to tag along .
red , what am i supposed to tell the governor?
well , you tell him that miss sally gerber over there . . . . . . from his office , checked me out on this .
oh , hell .
hey !
hello?
you coming or aren't you?
not a scratch !
you hear me , suttle?
on the truck !
on the trailer !
and you call me !
you call me !
why the hell we stopping?
you said you had a cousin near here .
so?
so call him .
see if we can shack there till things cool down .
why'd he take the keys?
so i won't leave him .
would you leave him?
oh , yeah .
he must've moved .
probably couldn't have heard him anyways , my ear's still bleeding .
you ever try that shit again  what?
what?
you were starting to threaten me .
it ain't a threat .
it's a fact .
here , kid , take the wheel .
in two seconds , i'm gonna break your nose .
that's a threat .
and that's a fact .
i'm gonna kill you for that .
and that's a threat .
beginning to understand the difference?
phillip , listen up .
i'm gonna run in and get some smokes .
get beer .
here , hold this .
point it right between his eyes .
what the hell?
if he so much as moves , you pull the trigger .
right here , see?
put your finger on it .
you're a fucking crazy man .
that's a fact .
you're getting the hang of this .
how do?
where's your sodas?
the hot ones are there .
the cold ones are in the back , in the cooler .
you ever shot a gun before , boy?
pow !
knock you on your ass .
quiet , mister .
no . . . .
you ain't never shot no gun before .
living with three split tails .
no daddy around .
you'll probably grow up queer , you know that?
now . . . . . . i'm gonna lean up here real slow and easy .
okay?
just so that we can talk .
there we go .
now we can have a real man to man .
you are a man , now , ain't you?
will this do it for you?
this and a carton of lucky strikes .
those are some real cute little underwears you got on there .
your mama sew your name in them?
lnitials or anything?
let's see what you got down there .
kind of puny , ain't it?
the hand is quicker than the eye .
son of a bitch .
hell's bells , no shells .
come on up here a little closer , boy .
those . 38 shells you got up there?
yeah .
why don't you give me a box?
goddamn !
jesus !
jesus !
here , boy .
all is forgiven , boy .
you best come here , boy .
you know i'm gonna find you .
hey , boy , you best hope i don't find you .
what're you gonna do?
hit me with it?
but you and me are friends .
you got a phone?
no .
go inside , lie down till we're gone .
well , you coming?
get in .
red , i got a spot on them .
a store outside of ben hur , 50 miles from here .
yeah .
well , move that roadblock on 288 50 miles north .
figure they got that far?
i don't know .
but they don't either .
they're just glad to be out .
this is a sunday drive for them .
sunday drive , i like that .
i never heard you use that one before .
is something bothering you?
it's perhaps premature , but . . . . . . do you have an auxiliary roadblock plan for when they split up?
what makes you so sure they'll split up?
if you got something in your craw , spit it out .
their situation is an accommodation .
i don't think they'll be together long .
haynes and pugh are opposites , right?
haynes is a criminal's criminal .
robbery , man on man confrontation .
pugh has a rap sheet littered with manslaughter , you name it .
they'll split soon .
what about the hostages?
what are they gonna do?
flip a coin?
it's happened before .
it's a dilemma they'll address soon .
that's why we gotta address it now .
we don't have a dilemma .
neither do they .
they'll get rid of one hostage and keep the other .
if they haven't already .
command , put your roadblock on 288 , north about 50 miles .
that's right , 50 miles .
uh huh .
we need to talk , chief garnett .
you can call me red .
red . . . . . . why are you so hell bent on embarrassing me?
i'm only hell bent on one thing .
you get to know me . . . . . . you'll find having a sense of humor will get you a lot .
i have a fine sense of humor .
but i won't be your straight man . . . . . . so you can play hero to morons who think you're sherlock holmes .
oh , shit !
damn .
arthur godfrey said this stuff keeps you young .
i'm not sure it's worth it .
so that's my answer?
this is your first time in the field?
i thought so .
what was you expecting anyway?
you think i'm some dumb schoolgirl . . . . . . who's wandered into the boys 'locker room?
you're wrong .
i don't mean to boast . . . . . . but i happen to be one of the two most intelligent people in this fiasco .
i didn't ask that .
i asked what you're expecting .
i expected to be allowed to do the job assigned to me by the governor .
i like the governor .
he and i go quail hunting at least once a year .
but he knows that win , lose or draw , this is my ship .
understand?
yeah , i got that .
you know what that is?
that's anarchy .
and i call that horseshit , to use a cowboy colloquialism .
no , i'll tell you what's horseshit .
horseshit is responsibility .
that's the guy who has sleepless nights and ulcers .
if this thing goes bloody , the governor , he loses a few votes .
me , i'm the one who . . . .
i'll tell you what .
you see me making a wrong move , go ahead and speak up .
i might not agree , but i'll listen .
as for wounded pride , i'll buy all the drinks when this is over . . . . . . but right now i got better things to think about .
that fair?
yeah .
good .
so who's the other one?
other one?
you're one of the two brains .
who's the other?
haynes .
we tested him in prison .
thank you .
are you gonna shoot me?
no !
hell , no .
me and you are friends .
if i was choosing a running buddy , i'd take you over him any day of the week .
we got a positive l . d.?
yes , sir .
only the boy is hostage .
not five minutes ago , we found this here .
yeah .
at least now we know who's in charge .
you ever ridden in a time machine before?
you have .
what do you think this is?
a car .
you're looking at this bass ackwards .
this is a 20th century time machine .
i'm the captain and you're the navigator .
out there , that's the future .
and back there , well , that's the past .
if life's moving too slow , to project yourself into the future . . . . . . you step on the gas right here .
see?
and if you want to slow her down , you just step on the brake here . . . . . . and you slow her down .
this is the present , phillip .
enjoy it while it lasts .
yes , sir , we're time traveling through texas .
we gotta find us a ford .
my daddy always drove fords , you know that?
that's an intercom system .
now , you can get and give information to and from the rear vehicle .
how's it work?
well , you press the power button .
but if you've got the volume turned up . . . .
bradley , dang it !
you will blow the speakers .
my god . . . .
there .
that should put his pecker in a sling .
sorry , ma'am .
dick humor , unique .
shouldn't these be roadblocked?
now , in a perfect world . . . . . . we'd lock arms and thrash the bushes until he turned up .
in a perfect world , things like this wouldn't happen .
adler , we're proceeding on fm 1491 .
our locals are heading out .
you want to follow them?
no , we'll just keep cruising .
he'll turn up eventually .
okay , we're gonna do some car shopping .
you ever play cowboys and lndians?
see that ford sedan?
i want you to sneak over there like an lndian and take a peek .
see if the keys is in it .
don't have to if you don't want to .
but i'd appreciate it , you being the navigator and all .
hey , phillip !
phillip !
check for a radio too .
it's got keys and a radio .
i checked .
good man .
can we stop at the filling station?
what for?
number one .
this here's nature , phillip .
you just pee over by the tree .
that's my car !
start , you son of a bitch !
get in the car , phillip !
phillip , get in the car !
jump !
goddamn , how many rcs did you drink?
four .
adler , if we get a clean shot , can we take it?
red , if they get a clean shot , should they take it?
no .
i don't want any half ass sergeant taking a potshot with a deer rifle .
right thing to do , he's got the boy .
you figure he'll just give up .
maybe , maybe not .
well , now , there's a safe bet .
well , he's better off now than he was .
that third eye pugh is sporting in the morgue speaks otherwise .
then why not just shoot to kill?
now , there's a brainstorm .
the roadblock's got the stolen vehicle's license .
you still want to go to the farm?
yeah .
yeah , i got a hunch .
never met a brown eyed phillip before .
who are you named after?
my daddy .
you and your old man get along?
yes , sir .
toss the ball around , play grab ass in the yard?
no , sir .
why the hell not?
he ain't around , really .
well , he is or he ain't .
when's the last time you saw him?
me and you got a lot in common , phillip .
the both of us is handsome devils .
we both like rc cola .
and neither one of us got an old man worth a damn .
my mama says he'll come back .
probably when i'm 1 0 or so .
well , she's lying to you , pure and simple .
all right?
he ain't ever coming back .
guys like us , phillip . . . . . . we gotta be on our own .
seek foolish destiny .
that sort of thing .
you responsible for the maintenance on that?
that's right .
i'm the full time driver .
what?
it's slipping a bit going into second .
seems like somebody's been heavy footed with the clutch .
i'd put that on a list if i was you .
well . . . . . . ain't no bodies here , thank god .
you got the keys to this vehicle?
no .
see if we got a pry bar in the car .
yes , sir .
here you go , red .
you might want to wait in the boat .
please .
well , there's our bureaucrat .
nice to know the boy's in good hands .
here .
i don't want  gallows humor , sally .
without it , we'd all be losing our lunch .
want some water?
no .
you ready to get into some britches?
all right , then , let's go .
first , we gotta come up with some a . k . a . 's .
you know , fake identities .
names to call each other when we're around other folks .
you go ahead and you think one up .
whatever name you want .
any name i want?
any name you want .
well , hello there , and welcome to friendly's .
looks like he needs some pants .
as a matter of fact , shoes and new skivvies too .
he'll tell you his size .
go with the lady , buzz .
buzz .
buzz .
go with the lady .
buzz , what a cute little name .
like a bee .
oh , look , a friendly ghost .
say " boo .
boo .
not very scary .
but you'll have a whole year to work on it .
it's a good price too .
what did you go as this year?
a bandit .
oh , shit !
pete .
yeah?
this is terrance .
i think i got it .
what do you think?
look good .
will that be all for you today , sir?
you folks are about the grinningest bunch i ever seen .
mr. willits holds a contest every month .
the friendliest employee gets a $20 bonus .
pete , i'm all set down here .
you?
copacetic .
let's just keep him tied up till the state boys get here .
the hunt continues for butch haynes ... ... who escaped from the security unit over in huntsville .
haynes , 6'1 " , 185 pounds with brown hair , is armed and dangerous .
he was last seen in ....
here are the clothes .
buzz has his heart set on a halloween costume for next year .
it's half off . four miles south of desdemona .
complicating attempts to catch him ... ... haynes has an 8 year old boy with him as hostage .
authorities have found the slain body ....
we'll get it next time .
go wait in the car , son . hostage taken by haynes and his fellow escapee , terry pugh .
billings 'body was found in the trunk of his car .
the car , used in the prison escape ... ... was discarded near a farm where another car was stolen this morning .
the stolen car is a yellow ford sedan .
anyone who spots it should contact law enforcement offiicials .
as we reported earlier , the body of terry pugh ....
you're truly the friendliest clerk i ever met .
thank you for shopping friendly's .
copy , 149 , hold your 20 .
damn !
what the what the hell? !
he's coming back !
get out of there !
we can't lose both vehicles !
i knew something was wrong from the get go .
look , he left his little boy !
he's got the casper costume !
he stole it !
buzz , you little shit !
shoplifting is a crime !
up to you , buzz !
you'll never get away with this , you little mister !
you ain't so friendly .
take them nasty skivvies off , put these jeans on .
what do you got there?
a ghost suit .
from the store?
you kiped it?
well , hell , phillip , put it on .
you ain't mad?
let's understand each other .
stealing's wrong , okay?
but if there's something you need bad and you ain't got the money . . . . . . it's okay to take a loaner on the item .
it's what you call an exception to the rule .
what's wrong?
nothing .
you don't want to get undressed in front of me?
you embarrassed because i might see your pecker?
it's . . . . . . puny .
what?
it's puny .
who told you that?
let me see .
go on , i'll shoot you straight .
hell , no , phillip .
it's a good size for a boy your age .
here they come .
he bought some tape , rope , and clothes for the kid .
the kid could have gotten away , but he didn't .
probably scared to death .
well , one more thing .
the kid stole a halloween outfit .
so they're a team .
with a pit stop in noodle , they're heading for the panhandle .
there's more roads than people there .
how?
poor counties .
they half finish a road , start another .
if anybody knows them back roads , it's red .
okay . . .
. . . so . . . . . . i'm robert haynes .
everybody calls me butch .
i was born in amarillo . . . . . . but grew up in the french quarter in new orleans .
what's she doing , red?
i killed a man when i was 8 .
how did you kill him?
shot him with a . 38 .
there was always one lying around the dance hall .
that's what they called it , but it was a brothel .
we lived there .
what did the authorities do?
victim was wanted by the locals . . . . . . so the whole thing got swept under the carpet , cajun style .
they didn't even send him to the juvie?
put me in school .
i was three years behind , but i catch up .
things are going pretty good now .
yeah , they are for a while .
and when i'm 1 2 , mama dies .
what happened?
delilah jane haynes hung herself in the bathroom of the whorehouse .
post mortem check uncovered last stage syphilis .
where's your father?
nobody knows where he is .
ditched when i was 6 .
he was a small time felon .
popped back up after mama died .
he'd just been put on parole , so he moves us back to amarillo .
a year later , i'm back in trouble .
kill somebody else?
saw a ford coupe i couldn't resist .
so i took her for a spin .
hell , that ain't no big deal .
that's what i thought .
but the judge didn't .
i got four years in gatesville , toughest juvie in texas .
that's where he learned to be a criminal .
we've seen that before .
butch , why don't you tell us where you're headed . . . . . . and save us some trouble .
see , you missed it .
because where i'm going . . . . . . isn't near as important as why i'm going there .
shit !
because i'm running , they're chasing . . . . . . i'd just as soon go north , as south , as east , as west .
it's a fun little game . . . . . . but right now , haynes doesn't have any idea where he's headed .
hold your pointing finger along the line of the road , okay?
okay , you got three lines on a finger , don't you?
each one's an inch .
so how many inches to childress?
one . . . . . . two . . . .
six .
you're a hell of a navigator , phillip !
a lot smarter than terry .
of course , who you gonna brag to about that?
lookie there !
what is it?
it's kind of like a silver whale .
and there's people inside , just like old jonah in the bible .
go like this , maybe they'll honk back at us .
what do you think?
well , okay , do it .
the boy stole a halloween costume?
which one?
it was casper the friendly ghost .
that was them passing us !
what? !
that was them !
turn around !
bradley , turn around !
it's not safe to do more than 65 with this much load .
they're coming fast .
get down in the seat and lay down .
why?
hell , i don't know .
because i said so .
you're burning her up !
hold on .
come on !
take that wide !
what're you doing?
i'm following the fugitive , fool !
what are you doing now?
uh , red . . . .
shit .
red?
red's gonna be pissed now .
oh , god !
are you trying to kill us? !
shit .
yeah .
oh , my god .
idiot !
red , they wanna know if the boy looked okay .
he was laughing and waving .
don't tell them that .
no .
they said the boy looked a okay .
well , that's great .
he'll be fine , mrs. perry .
this'll be over before you know it .
you'll be home with your boy .
i promise .
i want you to know that i've okayed the use . . . . . . of a new high tech mobile home from which to conduct this manhunt .
it's an amazingly futuristic piece of law enforcement equipment .
started this road 20 years ago .
still ain't finished .
it appears to me we got a decision to make .
it's up to you .
we can backtrack to the highway or we can try it on foot .
where are we going?
it's alaska , phillip .
last of the wild frontier .
it's pretty .
it's beautiful .
you ever been there?
no .
i just got the one postcard .
but anyhoo , back to our present dilemma .
you feel like a hike?
how far?
can't be more than , say . . . . . .
1 500 miles .
you're probably right .
go give our supplies a check .
what's it look like?
a soda , some gum , and half a moonpie .
rations for one , at best .
come on .
red !
the governor insists on having the trailer back for the parade tomorrow .
tell him to come get it .
yes , sir .
where are we going?
we're going trick or treating .
what's the matter?
we're not allowed to trick or treat .
huh?
my mama doesn't allow it .
trick or treating?
why not?
against our religion .
it's against your what kind of foolishness is that?
jehovah's witness .
now , phillip , i'm asking you .
i ain't asking your mother or jehovah .
you wanna go trick or treating or not?
okay , all you gotta do is knock on the door .
and when they answer it , you say , " trick or treat . " got it?
now , wait till they come .
now , phillip .
trick or treat .
if you ain't the cutest little ghost i ever did see .
say it again .
trick or treat , ma'am .
since halloween was yesterday , you're gonna have to trick me .
and you missed them caramel popcorn balls i made up special .
just wait right here .
perfect .
what do you say , phillip?
thank you .
never underestimate the kindness of the common man , phillip .
you sure there's no meat in there?
spam maybe?
vienna sausage , anything like that?
nothing .
can you make some mustard sandwiches?
yes , sir .
well , go to it .
here , you can spread it with that .
yeah , that one's mine .
be right back .
don't be stingy with that mustard , now .
hold it right there .
you can go .
butch !
butch !
phillip !
butch , help !
grab the kids .
quick !
run !
phillip !
forget the car , bob .
it's only got 1 000 miles on it !
phillip , hit the brake !
butch !
oh , my !
