s .
bueno .
family is everything .
no?
now , do you love your son?
s .
now ... do you understand?
you have a $ 10 million insurance policy .
i know that .
georgina !
obey me , i will love you .
come on .
that's how it works , huh?
simple .
that's right .
mwah .
she got a sister?
how's business?
thejapanese are here in a big way .
cheap labor , factory space .
but they feel a lot safer living over the border in el paso .
i ferry them back and forth .
they think i'm john wayne .
ah .
come on .
i live like a king down here .
yes , you do .
you been workin '?
yeah .
no .
nah .
been movin 'around , you know .
colombia , couple of places i can't name .
nothing catches my fancy .
oh .
you think god will forgive us for what we've done?
no .
you don't?
me either .
how long you staying?
i don't know .
i just ... you know .
i wanted to see you , ray , see how you're doin '.
you know , i came by on impulse .
well , i could do with some impulse .
what happened?
family paid the ransom ... then they sent the kid home after a couple of days ... minus an ear , of course .
now every mother in mexico city with a little bit of money wants bigger and better bodyguards ... my own wife included .
i hate to break it to you , but she's right .
she's right .
look , sammy , all my clients have , uh , kidnap and ransom insurance .
i have a policy .
a. i. g. my dad gave it to me .
yeah , i know .
i got it for your dad .
but what are you gonna do in 60 days when you can't renew it?
you can't because you don't have a bodyguard .
i had to let emilio go .
you gotta please lisa .
i mean , hey , ass like that's hard to find .
look , a bodyguard's like anything else .
you get what you pay for , okay?
you could do this .
you get one that's got a decent rsum .
we're not looking for goddamn superman here , right?
get someone cheap till you renew the policy ... and then , uh ... then fire the prick for whatever .
incompetence .
all kidding aside , the most important thing is that your daughter goes back to school ... and that your wife gets to save face .
this way , you won't be the only unprotected family in the neighborhood .
that's right .
a bodyguard .
your spanish is good enough .
you're crazy .
you even look the part .
in my state , i couldn't guard a corpse .
it's rich guys flashing their cash .
it's all for show .
nothing's gonna happen .
yeah?
you think they'd hire a drunk , a has been?
you have to keep it under control .
what if there was , you know , say , a kidnapping attempt?
what do i do then?
you do your best .
they're not gonna be paying you enough to perform miracles .
i don't know .
it's not exactly a scam , crease .
even at half speed , you're pretty damn good .
yeah .
bodyguard's gotta be close to people though .
he gotta talk all the time , and i'm no good at that .
you'll be the silent type .
people are gonna appreciate that .
bodyguard .
so who's the guy?
samuel ramos .
he's a young guy .
he owns one of the plants in jurez .
yeah?
thejap car industry is in the toilet .
he's trying to persuade ford to partner with him .
i think he's in trouble .
his family lives in mexico city .
he asked me if i knew anybody he could trust .
and you thought of me .
yeah .
take a job , crease .
breathe some air .
then decide if you want to stick around or not .
besides , i'm glad to see you .
i got nobody to talk to down here .
listen , my wife wants someone presentable and polite .
you'll be the fifth candidate she sees this week .
your rsum's quite impressive .
sixteen years of military experience , extensive counterterrorism work .
i'm surprised anybody could afford you .
what's the catch?
i drink .
how does that affect you?
well ... coordination , reaction time .
if top professionals try to kidnap your daughter , i'll do the best i can ... but the service will be on par with the pay .
what if amateurs tried?
i'd probably kill 'em .
is that likely?
no .
no one is to know about your drinking .
that includes my wife .
lisa . !
lisa !
people chanting ]
my wife , lisa .
and this is john creasy .
you're an american .
so are you .
it's all in there .
would you like a drink?
yes , uh , jack and water'd be good .
have you done much of this kind of work before?
no , ma'am .
but he has a lot of experience in related fields .

school tomorrow , peeps .
does that mean we can get a dog?
dad promised me one when i went back to school .
yeah , we'll see .
if you get a dog , will you give up your bear?
you're getting too old for him .
how'd you like mr. creasy?
creasy .
he said to call him just creasy .
uh huh .
that isn't disrespectful , is it?
no , not if he asked you .
here .
there you go .
he's like a bear too .
yeah?
a big , sad bear .
is he sad?
i think .
or something .
good night , honey .

oh , can you get me some floss in the morning?
floss?
yeah , the strawberry kind .
oh , sure .
good night , bear .
creasy bear .
what's that one for?
la virgin de guadalupe .

for toyota , for ford .
if one dies , maybe she can resurrect the other one .
i don't know .
she likes him .
what are you talking about?
creasy .
pita likes him .
pita loves school .
pita would love count dracula ifhe took her back there , honey .
okay?
hey .
are you okay?
i don't know .
okay?
i don't know , lisa .
i'm trying .
come on , bird .
that's right .
that's right .
come on .
all right .
home to emilio .
you're home free , baby .
where are you from , creasy?
the u. s.
i know , but which state?
no state in particular .
you can drive and talk at the same time .
no , i can't , pita , so , please , let me just do my job .
are you going to stay?
my last bodyguard left .
somebody gave him more money than we could .
i guess that makes me a bargain then , huh?
being black ... is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in mexico?
time will tell .
there were 2 4 kidnappings in mexico city in the last six days .
four a day .
yeah?
twenty four?
twenty four .
what do you think about that , creasy?
i think that you know entirely more than you should .

it won't happen again .
no offense , but i regret that your profession needs to exist .
so do i , madre .
so do i.
do you ever see the hand of god in what you do?
no , not for a long time .
the bible says , " be not overcome of evil , but overcome ...
overcome evil with good .
i'm the sheep that got lost , madre .
when you were a kid , creasy , did you like school?
i don't remember .
you don't remember?
no , i don't remember .
it , uh ...
nah , i didn't like it .
why not?
because it wasn't a school like yours .
there was no , uh ... no sister anna .
were you unhappy?
being unhappy , pita , that's a state of mind .
i really don't remember .
what happened to your hand?
it's a birth defect .

yeah , sometimes .
can i talk to you for a minute?
sure .
how are you doing with pita?
fine .
fine .
soon as she figures out that i'm not her new toy , we'll be fine .
yeah , she told me about that .
okay .
you don't have children , do you?
i told you i didn't .
well , they can be tenacious when they want something .
and pita just wants to be friends .
okay .
but you're paying me to protect her , right?
not to be her friend .
right?
so , uh ...
iook , maybe this isn't gonna work out .
maybe your husband should find somebody who's a little more sociable .
no , you're right .
you're being paid to protect her ... and i'm confident that you'll do that .
i'll be coming with you tomorrow .
i hope that's all right .
you think god will forgive us for what we've done?
i'm tired ofkillin ; ray .

repeat the drop instructions .
okay , the money , 10 million , u. s. , will be divided into ... two 15 gallon black canvas bags , each containing five million ... which will be checked at the bank by the k. r. agent ... then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car .
you got a flat tire here .
this is for you .

follow it .
perfecto .
what are you doing?
he said no phones !
relax .
relax .
i'm just trying to protect your daughter .
just get me there , please .
what's going on?
hospitals can be very dangerous places .
especially when you have killed two corrupt cops .
leave the money in the trunk of the white car .
then return to your car .
do not look back .
remember , i'm a professional .
if you keep your word , i will keep mine .
hello .
