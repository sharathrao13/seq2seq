oops , oops
oh , g great , dad .
now we don't have any music .
oh , maxie , it's not so bad .
we'll just have to entertain ourselves .
do ya need a break from modern livin '
do ya long to shed your weary load
if your nerves are raw and your brain is fried
just grab a friend and take a ride together
on the open road
come on , maxie !
all in all i'd rather have detention
all in all i'd rather eat a toad
my old man drives like such a klutz that i'm about to hurl my guts
directly upon the open road
there's nothin 'can upset me
'cause now we're on our way
our trusty map will guide us straight and true
roxanne , please don't forget me i will return someday
though i may be in traction when i do
me and max relaxin 'like the old days this is worse
than dragon breath and acne , i'm so mad in a buddy buddy kind of mode
i think i may explode when i see that highway i could cry
you know , that's funny so could i
just bein 'out on the open road
howdy , boys is this the way to nashville
watch it , mac or you'll be gettin 'towed
i'm in no hurry to arrive 'cause i'll be turnin '65
the next time i sees the open road
just a week of rest and relaxation
yeah .
and the odd romantic episode
very odd .
and it's california or bust
look out , you dirtbags , eat my dust from now on i own the open road
it's me and little maxie my pipsqueak pioneer
they're partners forever westward ho
yee haw .
could someone call a taxi and get me outta here
to beverly hills 90210
oh , every day another new adventure
every mile another new zip code
and the cares we have are gone for good
and i'd go with them if i could
i got no strings on me i'm feelin 'fancy free
how wonderful to be
on the open road
sick of modern livin '
dad , you're gonna get us killed !
why don't you just give me the map?
oh , no , thanks , son .
navigating's a big responsibility .

h h h hey , the car !
what?
now you wanna drive too?
no , dad .
the car !
look !
the car !
what'd you do now , max?
i didn't do anything , dad .
i only touched it .
you locked it !
i locked it?
it's your door .
you locked it .
well , you distracted me .
whoa !
you should've put the brake on !
why don't you just put it on yourself?
see?
you ruin everything .
well , you ruined the vacation !
i ruined it?
i never wanted to go ... on this stupid vacation !
now look where you got us , dad !
where i got us?
you should've let me stay at home .
why?
so you'd end up in prison .
prison?
what are you talkin 'about?
your principal called me ...
it's not what you're thinkin '.
you even lied to me .
i had to .
you were ruining my life .
i was only tryin 'to take my boy fishin ', okay?
i'm not your little boy any more , dad .
i've grown up !
i've got my own life now .
i know that .
i just wanted to be part of it .
you're my son , max .
no matter how big you get ... you'll always be my son .
there are times you drive me shall we say , bananas
and your mind is missin 'no offence , a screw
none taken .
still , whatever mess i land in
who was always understandin '
nobody else but you
oh , your moodiness is now and then , bewilderin '
and your values may be so to speak , askew gesundheit .
thanks who deserves a hero's trophy
as we face each catastrophe
nobody else but you
nobody else but you
it's just our luck
we're stuck together
nobody else but you
is crazy enough to believe we'll come through
so your jokes are all let's face it , prehistoric
and your music sounds like monkeys in a zoo
but when life becomes distressin '
who will i be s. o. s. in '
if you're havin 'trouble guessing here's a clue
though he seems intoxicated
he's just highly animated
and he's nobody else
but nobody else but you
we've turned into
a true blue duo
hard times we've had a few
like we're thrown in the drink
like we're tossed outta town
but when i start to sink
hey , i'd rather go down
with nobody else
but y o u
aw , dad .
well , anyway , i figure she's never gonna wanna talk to me again ... much less go out with me .
what a dumb lie , huh?
well , whaddya know?
my maxie , in love .
gosh , you're really growin 'up .
happened so fast i guess i sorta missed it .
well , i think the only thing for us to do now ... is to get you up on stage with this powerline feller .
uh , how are we gonna do that?
now , you just leave that up to me .
no , dad , really .
i i think we should just , you know , forget it .
now , how come you always think i'm gonna lead you into some sorta calamity?
uh , uh , da dad .
what's wrong now?
look !
a waterfall .
waterfall !
dad !
max !
grab ahold , max !
dad !
10 : 00 , quarter to three , tour jete , twist .
i'm a little teapot let her fly .
perfect cast .
boy , this has been one crazy vacation .
and it's not over yet .
dad .
we made it .
come on , max .
let's get you on stage .
uh , maybe this isn't such a good idea .
yeah , yeah
then again .
dad?
dad?
hey , yeah
i got myself a notion
and one i know that you'll understand
to set the world in motion
by reaching out for each other's hand
dad?
maybe we'll discover
what we should've known all along what are you doin 'here?
yeah , yeah hey !
one way or another max?
together's where we both belong max?
if we listen to each other's hearts
we'll find we're never too far apart
and maybe love is the reason why
for the first time ever we're seein 'it eye to eye
that goof kid ain't there .
don't worry .
he'll be there .
seein 'it eye to eye
