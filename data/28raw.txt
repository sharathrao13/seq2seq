and so , ladies and gentlemen , welcome to the most famous motorcar race in the world ... the 38th running of the grand prix of endurance and efficiency ... the 24 hours of le mans .
we're pleased to welcome michael delaney back to le mans after his unfortunate accident here last year and to see that he is in such good form following his exciting race , a fortnight ago at the nurburgring where ferrari's top driver , erich stahler , narrowly beat him .
the delaney stahler rivalry will be interesting to follow on this very different circuit where the endurance of the car is as important as is the skill of the driver .
it is now five minutes to four .
five minutes to start .
will all drivers be in their cars in one minute's time , please .
drivers ... to your cars , please .
drivers ... to your cars , please .
four minutes to start .
three minutes to start .
two and a half minutes to start .
two minutes to start .
number 25 , driven by kurt ahrens ; number 15 , driven by michael parkes ; number 21 , driven by johann ritter ... ... number 22 , driven by paul jacques dion ; number eight , driven by erich stahler ... ... number five , driven by lugo abratte ; number six , driven by vito scaliso ; number seven , driven by claude aurac ; number 20 , driven by michael delaney ... ... number 14 , driven by gilles marnier .
over three minutes have passed .
we may expect the cars through the check gate any moment now .
will it be porsche or ferrari in the lead?
here's the leading car , porsche number 25 , in for its first pit stop for fuel and possible driver change .
and here comes erich stahler , ferrari number eight , closely followed by the first of the gulf porsche cars , number 20 , driven by michael delaney .
watch out for the red lola .
okay .
pretty quick pit stop for the ferrari ...
... and here comes 20 , back on the track .
still in first place .
gulf porsche number 21 , driven by johann ritter , entering the pit .
and ...
porsche number 20 delaney .
20 by four .
okay , thank you .
my colleague has just handed me a weather report , and it looks as if the possibility of rain ... which was previously forecast ... will shortly be upon us .
just one more , mr. delaney .
hello .
hello .
you had a very good start .
it's a long race .
are you well?
excuse me .
thank you .
what will you tell peter and erica when they get old enough to ask what their father does for a living?
i'll tell them that their father is the greatest chauffeur in the world .
if you had a choice , would you like to tell them something else?
for example ,
well , this week , daddy's flying to switzerland .
yes .
the new motor factory is almost completed and i have to interview various applicants for ...
what are you trying to tell me?
would you like that better?
only if you'd like it better .
if they ask me what their mother does for a living ,
i'll say " she lies .
she can look straight into your eyes
and tell the biggest lies you've ever heard in your life .
really?
yes .
it's the right time to stop .
i can finish quite well in this race .
perhaps even ...
well , in any case , it's the right time to stop .
as was forecast , we have our first touch of rain .
it's going to be very interesting to see what tactics the team manages in the rain .
if it's only a shower , they won't change from dry to rain tires .
but if it does continue , they must .
your attention to the pit area .
the longtail porsche , number 25 , is coming in , after having been out on the circuit for only 14 minutes , since its last stop for fuel and driver change .
the team of kurt ahrens and vic elford has built up a formidable early lead on the factory ferraris and the gulf porsche team .
however , it appears now that something definitely out of the ordinary has befallen the austrian entry .
you will recall that this is the car which , for the first time in the history of le mans , averaged a speed in excess of 150 miles per hour .
mr. delaney .
you know the white longtail is out of the race with a blown engine .
yeah , well , that's bad luck .
do you think it will be another ferrari porsche race?
a little early to say , but i think so .
what kind of race will you drive?
try to save the machine , go as fast as i can , try to win .
do you think it will be like nurburgring ... a race between you and stahler?
i hope not , ma'am .
and what do you think of stahler?
stahler?
i think he's probably one of the best drivers in the world .
excuse me .
what do you think is the most difficult thing about le mans?
to go as fast as possible , and keep the car on the road for 24 hours .
that's difficult .
would this be the same kind of race you had with delaney at the nurburgring?
well , this is le mans .
it's a different thing , you know?
do you think that you and delaney will end up having a close race here?
maybe .
he's fast , i'm fast , so we're always together .
good luck .
michael ...
how's that german car running?
fast .
ferrari?
fast .
it's getting wetter .
slipping and sliding .
michael , uh ... the press is making a big thing about us .
yeah .
but it's money .
that's american .
michael ... be careful .
now don't be a pain in the ass , erich .
and here are the official positions , two hours into the race .
in first place , ferrari number eight finished 35 laps at an average speed of 144 . 981 miles per hour .
in second position is gulf porsche number 20 at 35 laps ...
all cars have come into the pits to change to rain tires , with the notable exception of the three gulf porsche entries and the four ferrari team cars .
it is apparent that neither porsche manager david townsend or ferrari manager loretto fuselli wants to call his cars in for an unscheduled pit stop during this closely contested race .
looks kind of hairy out there .
at practice it didn't rain , so this is really your first time out in the weather at le mans .
j" a , " it is .
why doesn't townsend bring them in for rain tires?
why don't you ask him?
it's raining worse at mulsanne .
they're due in , in 11 ...
in 11 minutes .
i know .
your attention , please .
your attention , please .
there has been an accident ...
it involves lola number 11 , and porsche number 47 .
fortunately , the drivers are not hurt .
bring them in for rain tires .
here we are .
ferrari's decided to change at last .
and porsche number 20 has come into the pits , also .
now we should see a race develop between the mechanics , and they will determine who's going to be the first to go out .
20 is away first .
delaney now leads le mans .
and there goes stahler , now in second place .
no problem .
no problem , yes , yes .
it's nothing !
it's going well , claude , isn't it?
ou" i . " i can feel it .
the machine is good .
this might be the year .
well , let's hope so .
it's a long race .
i know .
don't think too far ahead .
lisa?
yes?
would you like some coffee?
no , thank you .
ciao .
what problems have you got out there?
only thing is , that off the mulsanne , in the middle of the road ... ... if you stay a little bit to the right and watch it when you come up over the hump , has a little bit of tendency to go this way .
be a little careful before you go into the cape , and you can out brake the ferrari .
hey , guys , move it !
all right , mike ...
how long?
merci .
monsie" u" r .
bon soir , monsieur delaney .
bon soir .
hello , mike .
how you doing?
cheese , please .
seems to be the only seat left .
may i sit down?
where are you living now?
in paris .
i have to watch myself in paris .
i always get fat there .
i heard you and erich had quite a race at the nurburgring .
well , he keeps me honest .
can i , can i get you something?
no , thank you .
were you hurt badly in the accident?
no .
was it difficult to get back to racing?
not really .
but it must have been very difficult for you .
it was , in the beginning .
i'm better now .
i was just wondering ... why you came back here .
for myself .
delaney's on his way .
dixie .
check the rear uprights on 20 , 21 and 22 .
all right .
gulf porsche number 20 , ferrari number eight .
as of this moment , there are 25 cars left in the race .
i shall give you a precise listing of the most recent abandonments in a few moments 'time .
watch the handling , michael .
just a slight return about the rear uprights .
here's the second ferrari team car coming in .
number seven , piloted by chris barnett .
another driver change should be in order .
yes , claude aurac will take over .
your attention , please .
your attention , please .
there has been an accident .
it involves ferrari number seven ,
porsche number 20 .
both cars are out of the race .
i shall tell you about the drivers 'condition as soon as i get word from hospital .
this way .
please sit down there , please .
yes .
can you tell us about aurac?
do you know if michael caused the accident?
we just want to ask you ...
i don't know .
i don't know and i don't want to talk about it !
do you compare this to last year's shunt , the one in which this lady's husband was killed?
i have just received word from the pit box that marta simca ... ... that marta simca number 30 , out of the race due to gear box problems .
just got word from the hospital about claude .
it's bad , but they say he will pull through .
and delaney?
nothing serious , but he's out of the race .
are you all right , michael?
i'm fine .
you sure?
yeah .
i'm all right .
where are we running?
third and fourth .
michael , are you all right?
yeah , i'm okay .
it was a bad shunt .
yeah .
where are you running?
third .
if you try to nail scaliso do it down through maison blanche .
he doesn't like it there .
thank you .
michael , are you all right?
i'm okay .
are you sure?
no .
i'm fine .
then what happened to the car?
it was my fault .
i made a mistake .
i wrote the car off , david .
david .
this isn't just a thousand to one shot .
this is a professional blood sport .
and it can happen to you .
and then it can happen to you again .
when people risk their lives ... shouldn't it be for something very important?
well , it better be .
but what is so important about driving faster than anyone else?
a lot of people go through life doing things badly .
racing's important to men who do it well .
when you're racing it's ... it's life .
anything that happens before or after ... it's just waiting .
what happened on the delaney shunt?
there was a problem with the maul , slower traffic got in the way .
the car is finished?
yes , the car is finished .
hey , david , 21's coming in !
get the jack !
it's a wishbone .
gulf porsche number 21 is experiencing something other than a routine stop .
from the action of the mechanics , it would appear that there is a problem with the rear suspension .
here is the second place car ,
ferrari number eight , coming in for what should be its last stop for fuel and driver change .
erich stahler will take over for the final driving session , and no doubt will resume the lead from gulf porsche number 21 still in the pit .
too slow .
stahler's in trouble .
the bonnet's up on ferrari number eight .
ladies and gentlemen , the first and second place cars are in the pits experiencing mechanical difficulties .
yeah?
hello , david .
are you fit , michael?
well , i'm a little stiff ...
i say , are you fit?
my knees are sore .
stahler's ferrari's in the pits with ignition problems .
we got 21 in with a broken rear wishbone .
dixie's fixing it now .
i want you to replace ritter .
he's not quick enough .
excuse me .
michael , i want you to drive flat out .
i want porsche to win le mans .
your attention , please .
your attention , please .
announcing a change of drivers .
gulf porsche number 21 will be driven by michael delaney , replacing johann ritter .

but you were going to quit anyway .
yeah ... but not this way .
ladies and gentlemen , through the chicane and along the grandstand straight , here is the new leader , ferrari number five , driven by lugo abratte , with only eight minutes remaining in the 24 hours of le mans .
