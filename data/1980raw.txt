mr. maestro , leonard bernstein , tape number one .
mr. bernstein ...
i have the utmost respect for you .
your music ... is both pure and honest .
and that is why i have chosen you ... to present the truth about me to the world .
my name is sam bicke .
and i consider myself a grain of sand .
on this beach called america ... there are 211 million grains of sand ... three billion on the beach we call earth .
if i am lucky ...
the action that i am about to take ... will show the powerful ... that even ... the least grain of sand ... has in him ... the power to destroy them .
these come in brown?
we do have that in a brown .
and a harvest gold .
and an avocado .
give me three of the brown and an avocado .
are you interested in that chair?
this is a naugahyde , very good for avoiding stains .
i look like that big a slob?
i can't sit on this plastic stuff .
i get sweaty and stick to it .
this doesn't come in leather , huh?
not this chair ...
jack jones .
bill wilson .
bill , what our new associate's trying to explain , i think is ... that this is leather with a naugahyde coating .
coating?
exactly .
comfort of leather .
just a little easier to clean .
no extra cost .
how does it feel?
it is comfy .
you know what you look like sitting there?
what?
you look like the boss .
are you the boss?
i got my own place .
what did i tell you?
did you write the gentleman up , sam?
no , he didn't ...
write the gentleman up .
can we deliver this for you monday , or is tuesday better?
tuesday's probably better .
<i>mr .
bernstein , sir ... </ i> <i>there are times that i have felt alone on this planet . </ i>
<i>and that's how they want us , isn't it? </ i>
<i>alone .
divided .
weak . </ i>
to our new closer .
hear , hear .
you smell something?
i do .
i smell success .
and you've got the odor .
all right , sam .
why do i say that to you , sam?
well , i certainly am trying .
got nothing to do with trying .
it's believing .
when you believe in what you're selling , you succeed .
because then you're not selling .
you see what i'm saying?
you're talking from somewhere here .
you've got to believe .
it's a gift .
i've got it .
marty's got it .
you may have it .
i can believe in anything .
isn't that right , marty?
it's true .
you want to know who the greatest salesman in the world is?
that man , right there .
he sold the whole country , 200 million people ... on himself .
twice .
and what was nixon's sales pitch in '68?
in '68 , it was ...
he said he would end the war .
he would get us out of vietnam .
and what did he do?
he sent another 100, 000 troops ... and then he bombed the living shit out of them .
that's what he did .
now , what did nixon run on last year?
ending the war in vietnam .
and he won .
by a landslide .
that is a salesman .
he made a promise .
he didn't deliver .
and then he sold us on the same exact promise .
all over again .
that's believing in yourself .
these are for you .
read them .
these , you listen to .
while you're driving .
while you're shaving .
while you're taking a shit in the morning .
you gotta believe , sam .
this book right here will really teach you to believe in yourself .
this book right here will really teach you techniques .
these will make you a salesman .
i guarantee it .
<i>the salesman who believes is the salesman who receives . </ i>
<i>remember , power is a state of mind . </ i>
<i>you have as much as you think you have . </ i>
<i>if you don't think you have any , you don't . </ i>
<i>talk about yourself as you see yourself . </ i>

hi , mel .

no .
he just walked out , just now .
so , how's it going?
what're you up to?
i just came by to give this .
this is what i owe him ... and if you could just get that to him for me , i'd appreciate it .
come on , sam .
julius felt bad how things turned out .
why don't you stick around till he gets back?
he didn't go home?

he just ran out to the bank .
he'll be right back .

that i would surprise her because i have a little extra for her this month .
all right , then .
you don't think it's a good idea .
you've got to know what's right , sam .
nobody thinks that sam bicke is going to make it .
i didn't say that .

i should have said something on the spot .
no , you shouldn't have .

it makes me sad that you would accept something , of all people .
sam , i'm just saying it's not that big a deal .

and it makes me look a little older and trustworthy .
you would trust me .
that's not really the point , though .
what i'm saying is ...
i'm surprised you would say that , bonny .

if your father went away ... would that make you sad?
he's not gonna go away .
of course he's not .
if he did?
if your mommy wanted him to go .
she wouldn't say that .

i'm not sure i understand this business about the school bus .
that's just it .
the bus is the business .
it's a movable store .
a movable tire store?
exactly .
you see , we take out all of the seats , just gut the whole bus ... and put the tires .
fill it up with the tires .
then you bring the tires to the customer , at his convenience .
you're a delivery service .
that's just the beginning of it , because i would bring the tire ... and change it , i'll put the tire on your car while you're mowing the lawn .
or anything else that that you want to do .
and we'd paint the bus a bright red because that would give the company ... its own individual identity and make it memorable .
a sort of trademark .
and you have the bus already?
my friend , my partner , bonny , has the bus and he has the tools .
and i bring the management experience .
and that you have as well?
that i do , sir .
yes , i do .
it says here you're currently employed as an office furniture salesman?
that's correct .
but i'm ready to move on .
and prior to office sales , you were a tire salesman with your father?
julius bicke , that's my brother .
brother .
okay , and why did you leave his employment?
he expected me to lie .
i don't believe that someone should have to lie to make a living .
all right .
over and over he would tell me ... <i>that 15 % is rock bottom . </ i>
sell below that , we lose money .
that's a lie .
<i>in the retail tire business , the markup is always at least 30 % . </ i>
<i>so , 30 is rock bottom . </ i>
what one should tell the customer ...
let me show you .
good morning , mr. ford .
i think i understand , mr. bicke ...
let me just show you .
good morning .
sam bicke .
you're here to buy tires .
yes .
let's get down to brass tacks .
this is the deal .
<i>the markup on all of my tires is 30 % . </ i>
i will show you the company invoice to prove that to you .
i'll do that for you , mr. ford .
i'll make you my best offer .
i'll split the difference with you .
i'll take half the markup as my profit ... and you'll take half the markup as your savings .
even steven .
fair deal .
what do you think?
what do i think?
or ...
yes .
no , i'm back to normal now .
<i> it's 15 % .
exactly . </ i>
but it's the same thing , what your brother offered .
no .
my brother ... <i>will go to 15 % , but he wants you to hold at list . </ i>
<i>5 % if you have to ... </ i> <i>10 % if you're gonna lose the customer out the door . </ i>
<i>but the salesman who offers 15 % , he's a failure . </ i>
he's a man who doesn't know how to hold his ground .
and who do you think , at the end of the month ... gets the promotion , gets the bonus?
the one with the biggest profit margin?
the biggest liar .
i'm sorry .
i just want you to know that i would run an honest business .
that i would not ask my salesmen to lie ... or make them feel like a failure ... or some kind of a piece of garbage .
well , that's ...
i admire that .
your idea?
yes , sir .
well , that's it .
that's it?
mr. ford , i want to thank you , sir , because this loan isn't just for me .
i think it can change the way we think about american business .
mr. bicke , i'm really very sorry .
that's it for now .
i have to send your application on to washington ... and they will review it .
and it's a whole process .
of course .
mr. ford at the sba ...
bonny , i gotta tell you , he was very impressed .
did you tell him the bus don't run?
i didn't .
did you tell him your partner was black?
i did , yes .
i checked the " negro " box .
that was stupid , sam .
this isn't working .
no , bonny .
the government is looking for black businessmen .

<i>$125 is your total .
i let the tax slide . </ i>

you remind me of my ex wife .

i should shop here more often .
you should , miss , or is it missus?
miss .
is this the current phone?
yes .
would you like me to deliver it?
no .
that's all right .
i'll have someone from the office stop by .
it wouldn't be a problem .
i'll be just fine .
you already are .
i don't want you to deliver it .
i'll have it picked up .
i didn't mean me , personally .
we have people who deliver .
i think there's been a misunderstanding .
i love my wife very much .
we are all married men .
family men .
yeah .
because ... what's odd about your aborted flirtation with that woman today ... according to marty's recollection , correct me if i'm wrong ... is that you referred to her dimples ... as being like those of your ex wife's .
i don't think i did that .
he sure did .
i think there's been a misunderstanding .
as i told you when i took you on ...
i only hire married men .
a single salesman is distracted .
a divorced salesman fails at selling , the same as marriage .
it's all right for a guy to ...
lie to some broad about not being married when he is .
that's fine .
that's to be expected .
but you wouldn't expect that guy to lie to his boss , would you?
i guess i did try to pick up on that woman .
i didn't want you to think that i was being dishonest to my wife .
you did try to pick her up then?
yes .
my son was correct in his estimation of your character?
yes .
and if i were to ask you and your wife to join ... me and marty and our wives for dinner in , say , a week or two ... that would be okay with you?
yes , i think that ...
she'd like that very much .
<i>when i was little i was taught not to be rude , mr. bernstein , but ... </ i> <i>what am i supposed to do about the people who won't respect me? </ i>
what i wanted to do is just check on the status of my application .
sorry , mr. bicke .
mr. ford should have told you , but processing takes eight to ten weeks .
no , he did not tell me that .
perhaps you could check back , say , september 1 .
september?
yes .
i do understand your position .
i'm sure that you deal with a lot of incompetence .
but i am a businessman ... and a businessman can't wait .
if you gonna have a future , you gotta make it .
so i would really appreciate it if i could see mr. ford .
what was your first name?
samuel j.
i will talk to mr. ford ... and if he has time for a meeting , we'll call you next week .
since i'm here , maybe i could just see him ...
if he has time , we'll call you next week .
deal?
deal .
least you could do is discourage him .
double bourbon and a vodka martini up .
it would help if you wore your wedding ring .
for god's sake , sam , aren't we done yet?
would you consider going to the dinner?
you could drive your own car .
i'm not gonna put on some charade .
if you're their top salesman ... what do they care if you're married , divorced , or queer?
sir , you should be ashamed of yourself .
that woman is my wife .
they make her wear that .
sam .
really , it's all right .
i'll just wait here .
i'm fine here .
mr. bicke , please ...
he'll understand .
he'll leave at some point and he'll be going to his car .
he'll leave at some point , i'll walk him down .
that's all the time ...
mr. bicke .
mr. ford .
it's good to see you , sir .
why don't we step outside and get a cup of coffee?
how's that?
coffee .
in the cafeteria .
actually , there's a machine in the lobby .
the lobby's fine .
have a seat .
now , how exactly can i help you , mr. bicke?
yes , well , sir ...

you can't expedite that?
it will take eight to ten weeks and you'll be notified by mail .

is there some way that this could be speeded up?
is there some way that could happen?
no , there isn't .
and if you come back again , i will have to add that to your file .

the landlord was kind enough to allow me in .
he stopped by .
i see you received his note .
julius .
we have some things to discuss , don't you think?
to discuss?
good seeing you , of course .
cut the crap .
sit down .
you're a very strange man , samuel .
i've always known this .
i've always tried to help .
so why would you steal from me , your brother?
i didn't steal ...
you did .
i had to bail your friend , bonny , out of jail this evening .
bonny?
for receiving stolen goods .
my goods .
did you think roger zeffler wouldn't become suspicious of your friend?
<i>that somehow this delivery was kosher?
that 550 tires belonged to that address? </ i>
roger zeffler is a racist .
perhaps that's so .
shame on roger zeffler .
but you are a crook .
so , you tell me , sam .
which shame is greater?
i am not ...
look at me .
this is your brother .
do i deserve this now , for you to lie to me?
julius , please .
no .
no " please , julius " .
no !
i have been to the police .
begging forgiveness for a mistake that was not a mistake .
because i took responsibility , samuel .
so that no one would go to jail .
so that this man , bonny , your friend , would not go to jail .
and my family caused this .
so you must tell me , sam , please ... which is the greater shame?
i'm sorry , julius .
what is your name?
i had an idea .
for a tire business .
like you .
i wanted to get a head start until my loan came in , and my loan was denied .
because they're racists .
nixon .
all of them .
like zeffler .
i didn't get the money because my partner is black .
i was gonna pay you back .
i'm just trying to keep my family together .
and the little guy just can't do it anymore .
because there's a cancer in the system .
the whole system has a cancer , and i'm being punished because i resist .
but somebody has to resist .
you're my brother .
as of this moment , samuel ...
i wash my hands of you .
no more .
that's it .
nothing .
and if you steal from me again , brother or no brother ...
i will send you to jail .
