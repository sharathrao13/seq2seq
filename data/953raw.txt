a long , long time ago , nosferatu , the undead , the race of the vampire , were driven from egypt .
most fled to the mountains of transylvania but others of better taste , including myself , travelled south through africa and over the atlantic to a beautiful island in the bermuda triangle .
there we lived for happy centuries feasting on the blood of travellers , until discovered by the hunters once again .
then , the blood that spilled was our own .
i alone escaped but a vampire alone is a vampire doomed .
my only chance was to find the one known offspring of our tribe that had been born in a foreign land a woman somewhere in this place called brooklyn .

who'll take care of my kids?
you don't have any kids .
i'll start .
don't worry about it , julius .
nobody's gonna miss you .
do it .
i wouldn't do that .
you might miss the heart .
you aim between the eyes , that way you get a nice , even spray .
what the hell?
who the fuck are you?
i'm maximillian , a connoisseur of death , you might say .
no one takes pride in the art , it's so rare you come across a clean kill nowadays .
you got two seconds to beat it or you're gonna share a coffin with carl lewis .
i already have a coffin of my own .
come on .
he's no fun .
he fell right over .
some fuckin 'wackos in this town .
let's get back to you , julius .
i guess you're out of bullets , huh , man?
no , i kept one special just for you .
lnteresting .
i've been stabbed and i've been hanged and i've been burned , even broken on the rack once , but i've never been shot before .
it kind of itches a little .
you have quite decent aim , though .
but next time ...
put a little heart into it .
oh , shit !
don't go away .
he's gonna get it with the gun !
no , don't !
holy shit !
he ain't gonna get me !
i've seen it all .
i'm getting my ass the hell out of brooklyn .
i'm going to the islands , somewhere peaceful .
coney lsland .
ryker's lsland .
devil's lsland .
let me light that for you .
oh , shit !
hey , yo , i don't know how you know me but ... everything is everything , i ain't seen nothing .
so you jump back through the window cos i ain't really seen you , i'm blind !
i got cataracts , i mean contacts .
i got astigmatism , man .
i'm blind .
where you at?
see?
where you at?
i saw you at the docks .
you're a liar , a thief and a cheat .
no , that's my brother miles .
i'm honest .
well , that's unfortunate because that's what i liked about you .
hey , easy , bro .
you ain't got to pull that blacula shit with me .
lf you're hungry , i'll run you down the kfc and get you a two piece .
i already had ltalian .
you're going to make me think you don't like me .
wouldn't want to do that , now , would we?
i got nothing but love for you , baby .
hey , what the fuck are you doing?
welcome to the party , julius .
oh , shit !
it hurts , doesn't it?
pain is an underrated experience but it happens to be my speciality and like it or not , you belong to me now .
h hey , bro , why you do that?
it feels kinda ... kinda right .
because i need your eyes in the day and your services at night .
but first i need my coffin .
come !
wait !
where you going?
what's up?
you ain't gonna be sucking my neck?
why?
you're my ghoul now .
i need you to help me find a woman .
a woman?
you came to the right spot .
brooklyn's full of hos .
i'm not interested in your hos .
i'm looking for a special woman , one of my kind , the only one like her in the world .
as i've come to her , she'll soon come to me like a moth to a flame .
so you're checking for a vampster bitch?
half vampire and she's ignorant of it .
the other half sleepwalks in humanity but i can cure that if i find her before the next full moon .
here?
yes , here .
somewhere in brooklyn .
this night shift is kicking my ass .
how come you never get tired?
i've always been more of a night person myself .
this is a good one , listen up now .
your faith will be tested as a loved one dances with death .
beware the dark stranger
and when all's lost , look to your soul for the answers .
i wouldn't wanna be you this week .
this is your horoscope , not mine .
that's my horoscope?
oh , shit .
we have no information on the cause of death but all bodies so far seem drained of blood .
what the hell is this , captain?
love boat came in a few hours ago .
there was 18 that we know of .
whole gang's doa .
aw , jeez .
ship's log?
sort of half rotten and it's in a strange language .
sent it to nyu to see if they could figure it out .
witnesses?
night watchman , silas green .
let him tell you what he thinks he saw .
all right .
hey , rita .
hey .
how's your new partner holding up?
she's cool , she just needs time .
she's had three months already .
i know her mother just died in a nuthouse but she's got a job to do .
she's a good cop .
she'll surprise you .
that's what i'm afraid of .
i got it .
kinda narrow here .
watch your step , lady .
excuse me .
my back is killing me .
how many more we got?
15 of them left .
careful there .
give me your light .
you need a cast iron stomach .
so you say you saw a ... a what?
it was a wolf , goddammit !
big , black ass wolf !
motherfucker jumped off the boat , ran over there and the son of a bitch turned into a man !
did the flip flop shit on me !
just like a whore i knew in detroit in '62 , '63 .
i'd go over her house saturday night ,
i come through the door , she's a man !
flip floppin 'and shit !
you ever had a motherfucker flip flop on you , going crazy and shit?
so the wolf you saw looked something like that?
the wolf?
that's a chihuahua compared to the motherfucker come at me !
you're crazy .
you seen a wolf , man?
yeah .
to the 25th power !
you people belong behind the line !
hey , b , where's your coffin at?
it's on the boat .
on the boat?
shit , we can't get it now , look at all these cops .
and you people , you people better keep back .
killer loves to bite .
and so do l .
jump !
killer?
here ... here , boy .
oh , shit .
lovely , dude .
hello .
someone here? !
it's you .
someone there?
shit .
damn !
chill .
it's just me .
shit !
did you see him?
there's nobody here but us .
someone's here .
i saw him or it .
lt?
what the fuck ... hey , what's wrong with you?
there's a coffin .
ln here , come on .
right in there .
look .
what?
i don't see anything .
l i could've sworn ...
rita , are you ok?
i'm fine .
absolutely fine !
good , cos that's exactly what i told captain dewey absolutely fine .
right .
you all right?
let me out of here .
what is that?
it's an ear .
a rotted off human ear .
yeah , but my ear?
look !
my fucking ear done fell off !
you've another on the other side .
besides , the benefits of being a ghoul outweigh the drawbacks .
what benefits?
benefit my fucking ear back on !
you put me in the monster union?
i'm on blue cross?
i meant blue shield , brother .
i have taken refuge in some sorry places ...
this is a bargain .
my uncle silas is the landlord ...
what the hell is all this damn noise?
julius , is that you?
it's me .
you little scared piece of shit .
i ought to whoop your ass for booking out on me .
you wouldn't believe what i saw .
oh , i bet you i would .
nobody believes me .
i know a big ass wolf when i see one !
what the hell's going on? !
just ...
who's that?
that's my boss .
you got a job?
what do you mean?
of course i got a job !
i got a good job , too .
he just need a place to lay low .
rent's double .
no , what?
triple .
you know you missing an ear?
that's just a trick i'm working on .
you can't triple the rent .
you got ...
night started off like shit but ... end up pretty good .
i don't turn nothing down but my collar .
howdy do .
welcome .
trash man comes on tuesdays .
god loves you , god loves me , bye .
good thing you ran into me .
i'll hook you up .
i'll make sure everything we do is gonna be right .
first , we in brooklyn now , man .
you gotta get rid of this thing .
you ever heard of a futon?
lighter , comfortabler , better for your back , good to fuck on .
you gonna scratch your ass fucking on this .
a couple of things to know .
one , never sit on my coffin .
two , i want to find the girl tonight !
sounds good , yeah . ls there a three?
i don't like mirrors !
got it .
maybe i am going crazy .
what's happening to me?
justice , it's not just the bodies or the ear , i got a feeling .
you got a feeling about everything and what do i say?
everything by the book .
but if it ain't in the book , going by the book won't solve it .
all i'm saying is give something to intuition .
we've got a development in that boat people mess .
a couple of stiffs on bates street .
one guy was ripped to pieces .
what about the other guy?
he's in one piece
except he's missing a heart .
two blocks from the docks .
very good .
what about the ship's log?
the university couldn't make sense of it so they sent it to this dr ...
zeko .
apparently , some sort of specialist .
zeko .
what's the address?
315 south rockaway .
that's a tough neighbourhood .
what kind of doctor is he?
i don't know , maybe he's a heart specialist .
let's check it out .
i didn't finish my coffee .
take it with you .
go .
come on .
captain , here's the latest figures on the boat .
zeko's , huh?
yeah , i got me the 41 1 .
i got the info and a happy meal .
good !
things were progressing well .
rita's vision of herself dead in my coffin was a certain sign she was destined to be my mate .
even my ghoul was performing well those duties only a ghoul can do when the cursed sun drives a vampire to the shelter of his coffin .
ln return , he would enjoy all the perks of ghouldom , maybe someday make vampire himself , all with only minor side effects .
shit !
what ...
what are you ...
what are you doing sitting there?
you got the dropsies , i think .
got no dropsies .
so , tell me , uh ... tell me what you think of these wheels .
i say lucky it's an automatic cos you don't have enough hands to shift and drive at the same damn time .
a wedding?
a funeral .
very nice touch .
i knew you'd like it .
i used to look like that in '62 .
same hair .
same clothes .
stop harassing the man .
lf i was you , i'd take a dick check quick .
it's all there .
it's all there .
thank god for small favours , and i do mean small .
see that?
young punk .
max , why didn't you bite this bitch when you had the chance?
she has to give herself to me voluntarily .
hey , this is brooklyn , baby .
don't nobody give up shit unless you got some cold cash or a hot slug .
ln this case , i know more about her than she knows about herself .
one dance with me , one dance , and she'll be mine .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
now you're talking , player .
i bet you dance that hammer shit .
show me what you gonna do when you get in there .
show me that old hammer shit you gonna do .
that's some good shit , man .
am i gonna be able to disappear in the mirror too?
i'm warning you .
drive the limo and shut your fucking mouth .
shut up !
hey , man , not while i'm driving !
shut the fuck up !
shit !
i'm driving ...
goddammit ! .. and you give me a brain aneurysm?
you put somebody eye out !
i had the lab do a check on that seaweed that was all over the boat .
seems that type only grows in an isolated area of the caribbean .
caribbean?
my mother did her studies down there before she had me .
how come you don't talk about your mother?
the paper said she was incredible .
there's nothing to talk about .
i never really knew her .
she flipped .
they stuck her in the institution , me in a foster home .
how'd your father handle it?
he didn't .
he was murdered down in the islands before i was born .
i wish i had known him , at least something about him but ...
wait a minute .
what?
lf we're right , that's dr zeko's .
that's one funky doctor's office .
so where is this guy?
i don't know .
closer than you think .
dr zeko , i'm ...
i know who you are and why you're here .
you know where this ship came from?
any one of 100 isles in the swells of the sargasso sea , in an area you call the bermuda triangle .
sit down .
the bermuda triangle?
dr zeko , what does the log say?
it spoke of a voyage filled with sickness and nightmares .
they believed an evil was aboard .
an evil?
i thought they killed the last of them but these men warn us from beyond he is here .
he?
nosferatu .
the undead .
the vampire .
look , nothing personal , my man , but this is a murder investigation , not a witch hunt .
now , that boat's crew are sleeping at the morgue , they are not ... cruising the boulevard sucking necks .
the world is full of false notions , detective .
vampires are a race , not a club you join by being bitten .
yeah , yeah , a race , not a club .
of course
beware , detective .
this is more deadly than anything your job has shown you .
a vampire has no mercy , no regrets .
he can change shapes .
he could be sitting next to us now and we wouldn't even know it .
yeah , well , i would know it .
rita , i'm gonna call in .
all right .
dr zeko , how do you know so much about this?
on my island ...
i faced one over a woman .
i lost .
she was taken .
here's my best advice and please listen carefully .
keep your faith , rita .
lf i know one thing , it's this you'll need it .
do you have a problem , pal?
there's a killer on the loose .
you don't say .
and what might you know about him?
well , he's very smart , very quick
and quite deadly .
do you know where this killer is?
he's right behind you .
it's all right .
oh , i'm gonna die .
no , not quite yet .
they're very much like us , you see ... misunderstood .
sorry .
this never happened before .
that's unbelievable .
thank god you were here .
god had nothing to do with it .
i'm max .
rita .
rita veder .
i think ...
you know , i know this is gonna sound like a line but i really feel like i've seen you somewhere before .
do you believe in the supernatural?
i might .
well , i had this dream ...
what kind of dream?
there was a beautiful woman ... a woman with a smile so lovely it could brighten the darkest night .
but she was trapped .
she was trapped in a prison where the moon never shined .
she couldn't escape because she didn't know how .
and then i came and i set her free .
did you?
the woman was you , rita .
i recognise you .
well ...
how did you set me free?
i set you free with a dance .
let me show you .
come .
what am i thinking?
i can't .
i'm on duty .
on duty?
sounds like a personal problem .
do you know who this is?
this ain't nick ashford , this is maximillian , all right?
this mofo's got a pussy surplus .
solid as a rock !
all right , fuck it , then .
he want to get it on with you , see?
so just be nice and show my man some respect cos he'll put it on with you .
she's straightened out , boss .
i'm sorry .
no .
who knew you were so popular?
but it's a good thing , cos i wouldn't dance with you if you were the last man on earth .
you ready?
yeah .
more than .
i'll see you again , rita .
ln your dreams , max .
she's one of a kind .
she is .
not your kind , though .
fuck them .
i got these two ...
this tongue of yours has complicated a very simple plan .
lf it happens again , i'll hang you with it , understand?
i'll have to take drastic measures , time is short .
hey , you the boss ...
gimme a break .
you saying some kind of evil spirit stowed away on board?
what if i am , huh?
you want cream?
no .
dewey heard you , she'd have you in a straitjacket .
sometimes i feel things , all right?
now , i didn't ask for it , i don't understand it but you can't explain it all by the book .
you finally get a man back here and you're gonna kick his ass .
lnteresting approach .
uh , justice , this is my roommate , nikki .
nikki , my partner , justice .
from the way y'all was arguing , i'd swear you was in love .
no .
good .
look , i'm gonna go on back to the crib , cos , um ...
it's getting a little late and ...
wait a minute .
you don't want the coffee?
no , you can buy me some tomorrow .
i've had my fill of superstition .
next we'll be seeing little green men .
right .
sure , whatever , ok .
you can find your way out , right?
you sure you don't want coffee?
no , i'm breaking out .
who painted this?
that's rita's .
she paints things she sees in her nightmares .
rita's got weird taste in art but good taste in men .
it's real late .
gotta go .
bye .
freud would say that if you leave something this important behind , it means you really don't want to go .
two words cold shower .
thank you .
now , he's obviously a man of poor taste .
my sentiments exactly .
you sure ain't from around here .
yes , you could say i'm a long way from home .
mine's upstairs .
would you like to warm up with some coffee or ... some other refreshment?
but i wouldn't want to keep you up .
oh !
fuck me !
fuck me !
oh , baby .
say my name , baby .
keep it coming !
i feel ... l feel like ...
damn you , justice .
goddamn you .
i'm coming !
i'm coming !
i do not believe you .
let me see your face .
let me see your face !
this part of the seduction is quite simple , really .
just take away everything she has , then give her everything she needs .
rita .
girl , i finally found a man who can make the room spin .
moving out to find a place of my own , cos we're gonna need the room to roam .
ciao baby , nikki .
right .
oh yeah , you , like , figure out what she's into and then fuck her head up with it?
ln a manner of speaking , yes .
but church .
she had to go to a church .
my pops said the quickest way to a woman's heart is through the church !
it's through the rib cage but that's messy .
no , there are much more interesting ways to her heart .
through her fears , for instance , or through her faith .
excuse me .
just a second , son .
preacher ... pauley?
and if you've been misbehavin ', preacher pauley's here for savin '.
well ...
i think that i'm beyond saving .
going to church?
i just wanna catch preacher first , is he still in the parking lot?
preacher .
i'm preacher pauley .
yes , how are you tonight?
rita veder , how are you tonight , girl?
i've been tossing about this case i'm on .
tossin ', right .
i've been having these ... really strange feelings .
i felt i needed to talk to someone that i could trust .
you come to the right place .
tossin 'and havin 'strange feelings .
and then i heard the voices .
you heard voices .
yes , like they were inside my head .
ln your head?
really .
does this make sense?
ls it possible?
you'd be surprised what's possible .
i'm just afraid of ending up like my mother , afraid i'm losing my mind .
afraid you're going crazy , that's good .
it's good to get that out .
you fear you're going crazy , tell people .
you need an outlet .
i get it out in my paintings .
you paint?
yes .
it's good to paint .
you know , when i was young , i used to paint ...
preacher pauley !
come on .
everybody's waitin '.
i don't know if right now's ...
go ahead .
the lord waits for no one .
get your butt in here .
right now is not a good time !
goddamn !
what did he say?
god damns anybody who doesn't glorify in his work !
it's a hell of a night outside .
let's do the sermon on the lawn .
come on , sister .
goddamn !
shit .
excuse me .
can we bring it down just a little , please?
brothers and sisters , please quiet down .
thank you .
we come here time after time and we talk about the same old same old .
hey , quiet down .
we talk about jesus .
that's right .
jesus said and jesus wept .
jesus heard and jesus walked over .
i don't wanna talk about jesus .
cos as the big man teaches us , there's two sides to every story .
not one but two .
a story is not one sided .
a story has duality .
there's two sides to every story .
which brings to mind the phrase " necessary evil " .
i know many of you hear that phrase and say ,
that don't even make no sense to me .
can't be no such thing as necessary how's evil necessary?
that don't match .
that's plaids and stripes , evil and necessary .
you see , because without bad , there is no good .
without light , there is no dark , you need both these things .
you hear what i'm saying?
lf every day is a sunny day , well , then , what's a sunny day?
well , the bottom line , what i'm trying to tell you tonight , is that evil ... eeeevil ... is necessary .
evil is necessary , thereby , if it's necessary , evil ...
evil ...
.. must be good .
evil is good .
that's what i think .
evil must be good , must be good .
let me hear y'all say it ...
evil is good .
evil is good .
take brother brown , one of our strongest deacons , pillar of stability .
brother brown was on bushwick avenue last night with a two dollar whore .
i didn't know she was no whore !
you lyin 'dog ,
you said you was at your mother's .
now , that's evil .
when you tell your wife , " i'm going to see mama , " then you go get you a two dollar ho , that's evil .
but brother brown had a good time with that two dollar ho .
you can push a two dollar ho and she don't have no limits !
evil and good walk hand in hand .
evil is as evil does .
i thought i'd find you here .
what are you doing here?
the captain has something for us , info on those stiffs in the dumpster .
what's wrong?
remember nikki .
you fucked her , didn't you?
we got us another one !
fucked who?
you know damn well who .
nikki .
you know damn well !
what?
nikki !
the whore of babylon .
that's what she was .
the whore of babylon .
i never touched that girl .
then you should change your shirts more often .
her lipstick's on your collar !
lipstick on his collar !
what kind of man are you?
it's a shame and a shock !
it didn't happen like that .
tell her .
don't be ashamed of yourself , boy .
don't be ashamed cos you went out and got you a little ass !
ass is good !
that's right !
i know many of y'all may be saying , " how can he say ass is good?
how y'all think y'all got here?
ass is good !
evil's good and ass is good .
and if you get you a piece of evil ass ...
rita , where are you going?
rita , you buggin '.
this is ridiculous !
then forget it .
no .
i left after you went to bed !
you don't have to explain .
no , she bumped into me .
i was at the station .
five guys'll swear it .
hey , she borrows everything else of mine ...
of yours?
did you say yours?
that came out wrong .
no , you said yours .
forget it .
you got your own rules , you play by your own game .
rita , you and i , we see things different , we know that , but that don't have to be a bad thing , it just means we have a lot to learn from each other .
now , look , i came here because i got a line on those two john does .

van gogh .
he's my favourite painter .

ls that the original?

he's my favourite , as well , so torn by visions that no one around him could appreciate .
i'm strangely drawn to his art .
it's sort of an outlet for me .
i know what you mean .
it's beautiful .
yes , it is .
to the beauty ... of the night .
right here , i got it for you .
go away !
police officer .
just wanna ask you a few questions , ma'am .
what are you trying to do , break my door down?
show me your shield , not like it'll mean shit .
just wanna ask about a friend , goofy looking guy ,
numbers runner for kitty caprisi .
julius?
he in trouble?
come on in .
i feel as if you know me .
we do have a lot in common , don't we?
some things , yes , but you've been to so many places , you've seen so much , you've had such an exciting life .
you might say that i've had several .
sometimes i wonder what's out there , beyond the skyline , beyond brooklyn , past everything i've ever known .
there's no place you can't go .
no place the subway doesn't run .
but what about your dreams , rita?
your dreams of another life?
and another world?
another you?
everyone has those dreams .
you've a hunger never satisfied and a need never fulfilled .
god only knows what i need .
and i know .
you need to give me this drink ... and give me your hand ...
and come dance with me .
oh , no .
i'm not a good dancer .
come , please .
just one dance .
come , come .
oh , max .
this is crazy .
there's nothing wrong with being just a little crazy .
i've never danced like this before .
and now , you'll never stop .
i haven't felt like this since ...
i've never felt like this .
how would you like to feel like this every night?
ls that a trick question?
to go to places you've never been?
yes .
drink the wine you've never tasted?
i can give it to you , rita .
a world where no one laughs at you for what you feel , what you see , what you are .
all you have to do is just ... say ...
say the word , say it .
looking for the girl?
the girl?
what girl?
you're a cop , you're supposed to remember faces .
the night watchman down at the dock?
right .
i'm also the proud landlord of this residential type place , so i do know who comes and i do know who goes .
i'm looking for a brother named julius .
julius jones .
jones , jones ...
i knew a latoya jones once .
called her mrs butterworth cos she had a ass flat like a pancake .
i haven't seen her around lately but i have seen your partner , yes i have .
you seen my partner?
musta done some serious bumpin 'last night with that cat .
what cat?
some suave motherfucker .
new tenant .
he's been tapping that top shelf booty !
i'm talking bang bang bang !
when she walked out this morning , she was bow legged .
so you know where she went?
i'd say she went home to sleep .
course , she didn't get none last night .
bang bang ... 1 3 fox , come in , over .
shit .
justice , where are you?
1 3 fox , what's up?
a doa at brooklyn city hall .
female , late twenties , captain requests you on the site .
hey , connie .
hey .
god knows who or what got her up there .
let me see that thing .
looks like a bed sheet or something she's wrapped up in .
shit !
damn .
nikki .
lf there's one thing a vampire has , it is patience , especially with those of his own kind .
but even that , in time , runs out and then in the family of darkness , blood will prove thicker than water can ever be .
rita , wake up !
rita , wake up !
damn , girl !
i musta called here 50 times !
did you sleep all day?
i'm thirsty .
what's going on?
what are you doing here?
it's about nikki .
whatever happened between you ...
she's dead , rita .
what?
but it's more than that .
the way she was hanging was exactly the way you painted it .
no , it was just a dream .
no , it's real .
everything that you believed in and i didn't is real .
justice , you saw her?
then somehow i'm not crazy .
no .
no crazier than the rest of us .
why me?
why is this happening to me?
i don't know ... but we'll figure this out , together .
now , we make mistakes and we have differences but ...
that's ok , we're only human , right?
you know what you're doin '?
no .
i'll make it up as i go .
i want this but ...
damn !
oh , damn !
ldiot !
easy .
honey lamb , now ain't a good time to fuck with the man ...
oh , shit , he got you too?
i'll handle this .
i'll be in the kitchen .
want a cappuccino?
welcome home .
do you still take red?
after last night , you'll want something with a little more bite .
what have you done to me?
only what you asked .
i didn't ask for this !
no , but you wanted it .
you needed it and now you can feel it , look at you .
you feel more alive than you've ever been , stop fighting it .
death becomes you .
it was you , wasn't it?
all the murders , the alley , the boat , nikki .
it's a gift but you have it too , i just unwrapped it for you .
gift? !
of what , death?
of life !
i have given you eternal life !
this isn't happening .
it's happening as we speak .
can you feel it?
come here !
listen .
listen to me !
do you hear that?
do you hear it?
that is the sound of the night and it's calling .
not to me .
not to me !
women .
frightening , isn't it?
yes , you are .
i meant freedom to do anything you want , any time , anywhere .
i know it's terrifying at first .
i passed terrified about half an hour ago .
all your life you wondered why you felt things that no one else felt , why you never caught a cold , never broke a bone .
this is just a dream , right?
soon i'm gonna wake up and ...
and i will be there .
i'm not going to be alone again .
i'd perish without you .
i gotta go back , go back to my life , you can't stop me .
you can't .
then go .
go back to your little shoe box apartment filled with those empty dreams .
go back to church and don't forget the collection , the preacher's whisky is running low .
go back to your job !
where they laugh and call you crazy !
or you face the truth that you have no place left to go but to me .
what do you know about truth?
you lied to me from the beginning .
your father sent me to you .
what?
that's the truth .
your father .
lf i had told you that when i first met you , if i had told you what you were , would you believe me if i told you that you were the daughter of a vampire?
you're lying !
you'd have loved your father .
your mother did before they killed him .
who?
who killed him?
who?
humans !
humans fear what they don't understand and hate what they fear .
he sacrificed himself so your mother could live .
it drove her insane .
but what if i don't want this?
what if you do?
what if you do?
who's there?
step into the light .
detective justice .
you were expecting me?
you or the dark one , could have gone either way .
personally , i'm glad it's you .
i need your help .
things have changed .
sit down .
rita has changed .
she's seeing things in her dreams .
now she's missing .
what kind of dreams?
nightmares .
she paints them .
a girl was murdered and it was exactly the way rita painted it .
and then ... then i saw this .
this is the last one she did .
then it's true there was a child .
i knew rita's mother .
i was in love with her years ago .
she studied the vampires of my island .
i was her guide .
i saw her succumb to the powers of the dark one and rita is the result .
it's like , just clean my house , i don't care if your kid's sick ...
please don't .
we must .
besides , she deserves it .
we must feed , rita , or we die .
well , here's my shortcut .
bye bye .
this one is the last .
he needs her .
he has to move very , very quickly .
i'll kill him if he hurts her .
you have to .
to save her , you must kill him before she abandons her humanity and feeds .
much as she is human , she is now also a predator .
what's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
i have pepper spray and i'll use it !
but i want you to know i understand the negro people .
you've been chained by the oppression of white capitalist society .
yes , well ... then you'll understand this !
your turn , rita .
taste her .
taste her and quench the hunger .
i won't do it !
you don't have a choice !
no deposit , no return , no going back .
help me .
i'm not going forward !
you can't run from your hunger !
there's no place you can hide !
forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us .
and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil !
help me !
where are you taking me?
you need rest .
we have a long journey ahead .
where we going , boss?
home !
while she rests , you pack .
we try to leave by dawn .
can i talk to you about my head?
drive !
ready my coffin .
she don't look ready , she need a nap .
i'm readyin 'the coffin cos we gettin 'the fuck out of here .
rita ... my sweet .
you must feed or you'll die .
i want to die .
