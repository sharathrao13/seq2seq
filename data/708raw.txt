another village has died .
let's go .
this place too , will soon sink into the wasteland .
1000 years after the collapse of the giant industrial civilization , rust and ceramic fragments covered the land .
over this wasteland , a deadly forest of fungi spreads , releasing poisonous vapors .
the spread of this wasteland threatens the existence of the remnants of the human race .
nausicaa of the valley of the wind
an ohmu track .
it's still fresh .
a shed ohmu shell .
magnificent .
i've never seen such a perfect shell .
good sound .
it chipped a ceramic sword .
the valley people will be happy .
they won't have to worry about materials for making tools for a long time .
what an amazing eye .
maybe i can fly back with this one .
got it .
it's so light .
the mushibayashi plants are spreading their afternoon spores .
how beautiful .
yet , this is a deadly forest .
if not for my mask , it would destroy my lungs in five minutes .
who?
what can it be?
it's an insect gun !
someone is being attacked by the insects .
sorry !
what?
a great pillar of spores .
ohmu? !
it must be the one that shed that skin .
you can't escape that way .
please , see the signal !
he answered !
he's coming this way !
why , that's
what a splendid ohmu .
to the windward side !
thanks .
ohmu , go back to your forest .
this side isn't your world .
see?
be a good child .
he's forgotten himself with anger .
i'll have to calm him down .
the ohmu's been stunned by the flare !
an insect whistle .
ohmu , open your eyes .
let's go home to the forest .
it's awake !
the ohmu's returning to the forest .
with only flare bombs and an insect whistle , she managed to calm the ohmu .
lord yupa !
nausicaa , you've grown !
it's been a year and a half !
father will be ecstatic .
i must thank you .
you've become a fine wind rider .
no , father says not yet .
oh , yes ...
i completely forgot about this fellow .
wow !
a fox squirrel !
i've never seen one before .
this fellow was kidnapped by a bird louse .
i mistook him for a human baby and i ended up using my gun .
so that's why the ohmu was so angry .
it seems he didn't inhale any poison because he was unconscious .
no , you shouldn't put out your hand like that .
he's small , but ferocious .
come ...
hey ...
there's nothing to fear .
don't be afraid .
you were only scared , weren't you?
master yupa , would you give him to me?
ah i won't mind , but
thank you .
kai and kui .
do you remember me?
such a mysterious power .
are you tired?
you've run a lot !
how's everyone doing?
what's the matter?
it's father !
father can't fly anymore .
jhil?
the forest's poison?
yes .
it's the fate of all who live near the wasteland , i'm told .
i should have visited earlier .
no it was really good of you to come .
teacher !
later , i want you to seeomething .
my secret room !
don't tell anyone lest they be frightened .
i'll go on ahead to tell everyone you're coming .
you hurry , too .
master yupa !
would you carry this for me please?
it disrupts the air currents so i can't fly well .
my , she reads the wind well .
come , just a little further .
master yupa !
welcome !
is everyone well?
both water and wind are calm , without problems .
master yupa !
ah , everyone's well , i hope?
it's master yupa .
we've been waiting for you , master yupa .
princess !
he's arrived !
just a second .
master yupa !
uncle mito !
working hard , i see .
tell us some more of those foreign stories tonight !
ok .
turn it .
it looks good .
oh , it's a really good one .
we must set out first thing tomorrow to get it .
okay , toeto?
master yupa !
this is toeto's child , who was born this year .
oh , let me see .
she's a fine girl .
reminds me of nausicaa when she was young .
would you please be this child's godfather?
so that a good wind will always blow for her .
i accept .
i'll give her a good name .
thank you .
may she grow as healthy as the princess .
yeah .
if we're talking about health , the princess if famous for it .
but it wouldn't do if the child imitated the princess's playing in the wastelands as well .
but thanks to that , i found that ohmu shell .
well , put yourself in my shoes as the steward .
i can't sleep easily at night from worry .
if we consider the ohmu's shells ,
we can't say that the princess's playing is for nothing .
that's true .
i was rescued , too , wasn't i?
saved by this child?
this valley is good .
every time i come here , my heart is soothed .
how were your travels this time?
it's terrible .
in the south , the wasteland has swallowed two more countries .
the wastelands are steadily expanding .
wherever i go , there's only hunger and warfare ... ... and ominous shadows .
why can't they live like you in this valley?
it's because here we are protected by the blessed wind that blows from the sea .
the poisons from the wasteland cannot reach this valley .
how about it yupa?
why don't you settle in this valley soon?
i'm in this condition .
everybody would be glad .
that's impossible .
yupa is a man destined to continue his search .
destined , you say?
grandmother , what do you mean by " search "?
my , my ...
you didn't know , nausicaa?
there it's in that tapestry on the wall .
i can't see it any more ... ... but it's the lord on the left corner .
that one , wearing a robe of blue , shall descend onto a golden field .
to forge once again the lost bond with the land .
and lead everyone , at last , to a land of blue purity .
master yupa , i thought that it was only and old legend .
grandmother !
you vex us with your teasing .
same thing , isn't it?
i only want to solve the riddle of the wastelands .
are we , the human race , destined to be swallowed by the wastelands and be destroyed?
i want to see and judge for myself .
if only i could help master yupa .
princess .
princess !
what is it , mito?
goll says he smells something in the wind .
it's almost dawn , isn't it?
i'll be right there .
good work .
it's a good storm ... ... but something's strange .
there !
see , again !
it's a plane .
why would a plane be in a borderland like this?
what's happening?
master yupa !
it's a plane .
a plane?
it's coming !
it's huge !
it's a giant torumekian ship !
it's flying strangely .
it's trying to make an emergency landing .
goll !
get me up !
princess !
that's absurd !
i'll guide them to the coast !
they've turned around !
here goes !
teto !
how could they?
they must have been in the wasteland and killed some insects .
pull up !
you're going to crash !
pull up !
up !
it crashed .
princess
it's at the seaside cliff .
let's go !
move it , let's go !
all who are able , hurry up !
it's that girl .
she's alive .
where?
the valley of the wind .
you mustn't speak .
i am ... ... rastol of pejite .
the cargo ...
please burn the cargo .
the cargo?
please burn it .
the cargo .
i understand .
it's all right .
everything burned .
thank god .
princess !
this lady ...
she's a princess of the royal house of pejite .
an insect !
an ushiyabu is still alive !
damn !
it's calling other insects !
it's hurt and can't fly .
bring your guns here !
that's no good !
if we shoot , it'll call more of its kind !
i'll kill it on the first shot .
you can't kill an ushiyabu with a gun !
then what?
wait .
mito , bring mehve , please .
right .
princess !
go back to the forest .
it's all right !
you can fly .
that's a good child .
princess .
thanks .
thank god .
who knows what would happen if we killed even one of them .
ohmu?
found one !
over here !
here it is .
there were spores on that ship after all .
they haven't given off any poisons yet .
we're almost done .
yup .
if even one remains , it would be a disaster .
what is this thing?
it didn't burn , even in the fire .
well , everybody , we'll return to investigate this later .
please go help burn the spores .
be extra careful .
really , what a mess they've dumped on us .
mito ...
look here .
it's moving .
it's as if it's alive .
master yupa , what is this?
in my travels , i heard of an ominous rumor .
it said that a monster from the ancient world was excavated from beneath the city of pejite , where it had been sleeping .
a monster from the ancient world?
it's a god warrior .
a god warrior? !
you mean those that burned the world in the seven days of fire?
this thing?
all the god warriors should have become fossils by now .
but , this one managed to sleep underground for a thousand years .
now that you mention it , it does seem to have human characteristics .
torumekia is a large military state in the far west .
and , with these dead captives from pejite ... i'm worried .
please take care of the rest .
what can it be?
it's a torumekian ship .
everyone , to the castle !
everyone , to the castle !
everyone !
to the castle !
everyone , head for the castle !
to the castle !
father !
hide , grandmother .
i'll stay here .
i'll stay here .
princess !
how could you? !
nausicaa !
you !
don't move !
if you do , this knife , shaved from the shell of an ohmu ... ... will pierce even your ceramic armor .
that man it's master yupa .
i ask the torumekian army .
last night , the people of this valley worked furiously to save your ship .
even now , they just finished carefully burying your dead .
though it may have been a small thing , is this the courtesy of torumekia towards such a country?
if you're starting a war , you should give a reason .
you should first send a messenger and state your complaints .
nausicaa calm down , nausicaa .
if we fight now , everyone in the valley will be slaughtered .
we must remain alive and wait for our chance .
that wench !
stop it , kurotowa .
but
oh hell .
what a bitch !
she killed off everyone .
your admonition pains my ears .
aren't you yupa miralda , the best swordsman in the borderlands?
our objective is not massacre .
i want to talk .
i ask that you sheathe your sword .
look !
it's the princess !
listen !
these are the words of her highness kushana ...
commander of the borderland expeditionary force of the torumekian empire !
we have come to unite the borderland countries ... ... to construct a land without worry .
you are on the verge of being engulfed by the wastelands .
obey us .
cooperate in our undertaking !
burn the wasteland !
take back our world !
burn the wasteland?
is that possible?
we have revived the miraculous skills and powers that once made the human race ... ... the masters of this planet .
to those who obey me ...
i promise a life without fear of the forest poisons or the insects !
wait !
you must not raise a hand against the wastelands !
who is this old crone?
hey !
take here away !
let her speak .
in the thousand years since the birth of the wastelands ,
humans have frequently attempted to burn down the poisonous forests .
but every time , a herd of ohmu , maddened with anger , ... converged to become a giant wave that covered the land and came as a flood ,
destroying countries , swallowing up cities ...
the ohmu continued to run until their own lives ran out .
in due time , using ohmu's corpses as the seed beds , the spores dropped their roots ... ... and more lands were swallowed into the wastelands .
you must not touch the wastelands .
shut up !
i won't allow such raving !
well , what will you do?
kill me?
wh why you !
go ahead , kill me !
i'm a blind old woman .
it's simple !
like the way you killed jhil .
lord jhil? !
what did she say?
lord jhil was ill !
murderers !
murderers !
silence them !
don't be easy on those who defy .
everyone , wait !
please listen to me .
i don't want any more bloodshed .
please .
please understand as well , grandmother .
let's obey these people .
it's a pretty nice valley , don't you think?
i'm opposed to this .
our orders are to transport the god warrior back home as soon as possible .
the order cannot be carried out .
our largest ship couldn't bear the weight of that thing ; it crashed .
but , you can't seriously want to establish a state here?
and what if i am?
are you saying we should make that monster the play thing of those fools back home?
well , i could understand that , but ...
i am no more than a simple soldier .
i would be overstepping my authority in such a decision .
hmph !
fox .
i will return to pejite .
in my absence , put all your efforts into reviving the god warrior .
yes , ma'am !
can we take this gunship?
yes , spoils of war .
don't mistake me .
i am not consulting you .
but , taking the princess to pejite ...
five hostages , the gunship , and goods , you say?
i'll leave the selection of the hostages up to you .
complete preparations for departure by tomorrow morning .
thanks for being the hostages .
never mind us .
look they intend to take everything .
i will leave this place for the time being .
i'll return secretly and wait for an opportunity .
we must stop the revival of that monster at all costs .
nausicaa?
teto , where is your mistress?
nausicaa .
what is the meaning of this?
these are plants from the wasteland .
i gathered the spores and grew them .
it's all right .
they're not giving off any vapor .
not giving off poison? !
although the air in here is certainly pure .
why?
even this venomous hisokusari plant has flowered .
the water here is brought up from 500 meters underground by the castle's giant windmill .
i gathered the sand from\ the bottom of the same well .
with clean water and soil i've found out that the wasteland's plants don't emit poison .
it's the soil that's polluted .
even the soil of this valley is polluted .
why?
who could have done this to the world?
you found that out all by yourself?
yes .
i wanted to cure father's and everyone's illness .
but , i'll close this place soon .
i stopped the water a little while ago , so everything should soon wither away .
nausicaa
i i'm afraid of myself .
i lost my temper and killed in spite .
i don't know what i will do .
i don't want to kill anyone else .
princess !
we've gathered these chico nuts .
we give them to you , princess !
everyone ...
so many ...
it must have been hard .
thank you .
i'll eat them with care .
poor princess .
hurry it up !
we're leaving .
come on , everyone .
don't cry any more .
it's ok .
i'll come right back .
really?
oh !
have i ever lied to you?
no .
have i?
no .
see?
now go , it will be dangerous here .
promise !
take care of the princess !
take care of the rest !
are we in pejite yet?
my butt is killing me .
my , my ....
the princess has chosen hostages that won't be missed .
say , don't you think this is strange?
why are they in such a tight formation?
it's as if they're afraid of an attack .
there's a huge storm of vapors under the clouds .
don't move .
gunship !
enemy attack !
ship number 2 , destroyed !
like i said !
how frightening !
perimeter defense !
it's a pejite gunship !
pejite?
damn ship number 3 , destroyed as well !
what is the corvette doing?
what a fragile ship .
the rear guard was caught up in it !
the barge's wire !
teto , hurry !
it's no use , this one'll fall , too !
princess !
stop !
don't kill any more !
stop !
princess !
hurry , mito !
princess it's no use !
we might be able to fly it !
what?
mito !
hurry !
coming !
engine , start !
we'll blast the door with the gun !
right !
come on !
quickly !
quickly , get inside !
mito , ready?
somehow !
engine full .
same time as the gun blast !
roger !
ready !
flre !
put on the masks !
we'll descend below the clouds and rescue the barge !
still warm .
please don't die , teto !
what a world down there .
i've never seen such dense a vapor before .
rear seat , watch to the right !
it's near .
it's still flying !
it's true !
it really is there !
it's the princess !
princess !
everyone !
hang on !
i'll extend the tow rope .
the hook is broken .
aerial retrieval is impossible !
i don't want to land and be eaten by the bugs !
i'll just die without any more ado !
calm down !
dump the cargo !
fare thee well !
do as i say !
dump the cargo !
rear seat !
cut the engine !
what?
the engine noise is a hindrance .
hurry !
p princess !
w what
princess , your mask !
you'll die !
put on your mask !
everybody !
i'll save you for certain .
trust me .
dump the cargo !
we'll do anything !
just , please , put back your mask !
the princess is smiling .
we're going to be saved .
hurry !
the bow is falling !
ignite the engine !
we'll look for a place to land .
a little got in my lungs .
princess !
is everyone ok?
don't move !
you
thanks for all your help .
princess !
why save such a
you're far too trusting .
did you think i would get on my knees and thank you?
you don't understand anything about the wastelands .
this is not a human world .
you can't know what will happen if you use that gun in this place .
in the battle a little while ago ... ... many ships fell into the forest .
the insects are angry .
look , above .
the royal yanma are the forest sentinel .
they will summon other insects soon .
we must escape at once !
fetch the spare rope !
mito , repair the hook !
don't move !
i'll give the orders !
what are you frightened of?
you're like a little lost fox squirrel .
what !
don't be afraid .
don't be frightened .
i just want you to return to your own country .
they've come !
quiet !
don't anger them .
this is an ohmu's nest !
w we're surrounded !
they're looking us over .
ohmu !
i'm sorry !
forgive us for disturbing your nest .
but , please understand !
we're not your enemies .
p princess !
that one is alive?
wait !
ohmu !
what's going on?
the ohmu's eyes are bright red .
princess what do you think you're doing with mehve?
when the water calms down , take off at once and wait up in the air .
if i'm not back in one hour , return to the valley !
but princess !
