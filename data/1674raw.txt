when it comes to kids , i know self esteem is important .
but are we really doing them a favor with all this " touchy feely everyone wins a trophy even if they lost " stuff?
and we're so afraid to hurt their feelings that we can't even discipline them anymore .
i am really disappointed in you .
now clean up that mass murder , go straight to your room , and think about what you've done .
and no dessert .
okay , maybe one cookie .
you're busted .
oh , my god !
dad you scared me .
good .
now you know how i felt for the last hour and a half .
you didn't call .
you didn't answer your cell .
you could've been dead or worse .
what's worse than dead?
believe me , there's worse .
so , uh , what's your excuse this time?
i went to see my friend keith's band , and they didn't go on until 10 : 00 .
and it just would've been rude if i left in the middle .
your friend keith's band?
who the hell is keith?
he's this guy that i really , really like , and it was really important for me to be there so i could get on his radar .
look , i don't want you on his radar .
okay?
i don't want you on any of his equipment .
>from now on , during the week , you have to be home by 10 : 00 .
10 : 00? !
are you crazy? !
and don't talk back .
i can't even ...
get to bed , you have school in the morning .
fine .
what the hell are you doing up?
it's after midnight .
i'm just chatting online with my friend in japan , shigetoshi takanowa .
what?
he just got back from school .
look , we talked about this .
okay?
if you stay up all night , you can't get up in the morning , and you can't afford to be late for school anymore .
okay , now go to bed .
but i didn't get to ...
and don't talk back .
whatever .
huh?
what?
i'm sleeping .
hillary was late again .
if you're not talking about her period , i'm going back to sleep .
ah , she just doesn't care , you know?
it's like talking to a brick wall that every guy in town wants to feel up .
and mike , he stays up all night talking to his friend , mitsubishi , then he can't even wake up .
can this please wait until morning?
fine .
it's like they don't even hear what i tell them .
or or they just don't care .
and you know what?
i'm tired of it .
you know , when i was a kid , i wouldn't dare talk back to my dad .
you know why?
'cause i was afraid of him .
but we're so concerned with the kids liking us , now they see me as their best friend instead of the authority figure that i am .
um , dave?
i'm pretty sure if you asked them , they wouldn't consider you their best friend .
in fact , not even a " top five " friend .
i'm just so sick of them talking back with their fresh mouths .
what?
you think i like that they talk back?
no .
am i glad they feel comfortable enough to tell us how they really feel?
no .
nah , nah , you know what the problem is?
they have no fear .
okay?
they're not afraid of us .
they're not afraid of their teachers .
they're not even afraid of god .
that's our fault .
we never took the to temple or to church .
hey , maybe that's a good punishment make them sit through sunday mass .
you know what?
i'm jewish , the jets are playing you take 'em .
hey , dad , i need you to sign this math test .
you failed?
no my teacher just wants your autograph .
he's a big fan of mid level insurance salesmen .
hey , this isn't a joke .
how could you fail after all that money we spent on a tutor?
it's first period and i guess i might've missed some classes .
okay , then you can forget about the father son ski trip next month .
sweet .
i've been trying to think of a way to get out of that .
you see what i'm talking about?
i i hope you didn't go to school dressed like that .
of course not .
i wore my hair down .
is that a tattoo?
a what?
no , it's just a henna .
it'll come off ... eventually .
i think .
it's no big deal .
no big deal?
it says " crack whore .
that's keith's band .
okay , you know what?
you're not seeing that guy again until i meet him .
and i'm guessing after i meet him you're still not seeing him .
fine .
then i guess you don't want me going to school because i see him there every day .
i could just drop out .
you know what?
are you going to sign this test , or should i just forge it?
do you not see me having ...
you know , you're at work all day .
i can see who i want , when i want .
all right , all right , all right , that's is it !
okay?
okay?
apparently , you kids have forgotten that we are the parents .
okay?
so to remind you of this , we are instituting a " zero tolerance " policy , effective immediately .
if anybody misses their curfew , or doesn't do their homework , or talks back , or just looks at us wrong , they are getting a spanking .
oh , my god .
are you serious?
you think this is some kind of joke?
do you?
just try me and see what happens .
yeah .
yeah .
eh .
now who wants to mess with me first?
yeah .
that's right .
that's what i thought .
remember , i'm the stallion .
okay?
you're nothing but ponies .
what the hell was that about?
pretty good , huh?
it just came out of me .
just put it back in .
you don't understand .
see , i'm taking back control .
honey , in case you haven't noticed , the kids are big , and they outnumber us .
i think the spanking ship has sailed .
has it?
oh , my god , are you were serious?
you'd actually spank them?
no .
of course not .
oh , thank god .
but they don't have to know that .
come on , sweetie , i supported your stupid swear jar idea .
what?
we put a dollar in a jar .
we didn't hit them over the head with it .
i'm not going to hit them .
it was just a threat .
see?
this is just what we need .
i created a total climate of fear .
yeah , you're sure as hell scaring me .
hey , guys .
hey , dad .
how's that project going , larry?
it's good .
i'm making an rna molecule .
if i can get the covalent bonds between the nucleotides to ...
yeah , yeah .
knock yourself out .
are you actually studying on a saturday?
yeah , just trying to catch up on some of this math .
guess what , dad?
keith finally asked me out , but i told him that you had to meet him first .
all right .
good attitude .
bring him by later .
yeah .
order yours now and i'll show you how to threaten your way to a happy home .
call 516 507 2370 .
that's 516 507 2370 .
now .
who the hell broke my putter and tried to superglue it back together?
it wasn't me .
i didn't touch it .
me neither .
superglue .
interesting .
isn't that interesting , larry?
you want to tell me what happened?
huh?
okay .
kenny and i were playing gladiator , and i sort of used your putter as a sword .
but the good news is , i did vanquish the enemy and cast off the shackles of servitude .
a a are you nuts?
do you have any idea how much this cost me?
i am so pissed right now , i i don't even know what to do .
hey , here's an idea .
why don't you spank him?
what?
that is the new policy , right?
i mean , larry used something of yours without asking .
yeah , well ...
and he lied by telling you he didn't break it , so technically , that should be two beatings .
that's true .
dad , i'm really sorry ,
i'll buy you a new putter ... somehow .
you're damn right you will .
whoa .
whoa , whoa , whoa .
dad .
you're not going to hit him?
i knew it !
i knew you would never hit us .
you're all talk .
hey , hillary , maybe he's just afraid that larry is such a fierce warrior , he's going to vanquish him .
why are they doing this to me?
i i don't want to spank them .
i don't want to spank anyone .
i i just want them to listen to me .
okay , larry , stand up .
you're getting a spanking .
what?
oh , come on !
i said get up right now .
but ...
but i said i was sorry , and i never do anything wrong !
you knew the rules when you broke them .
what ... what ...
dad , what are you doing? !
stop it .
yeah .
all right , get ready , larry .
wait , wait !
i know ... what if i just use a big backswing , and a little follow through?
it'll look painful , but it won't really hurt , you know?
like in pro wrestling .
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
i can't believe you just hit me .
what the hell is wrong with you? !
hi .
what happened?
what happened?
nothing happened .
what , do you think you leave the house and everything falls apart?
nothing happened .
dad just beat the crap out of larry .
you beat the crap out of larry?
no .
of course not ; don't be ridiculous .
it was just a spanking .
hey , did you get those tofutti cuties i like?
i cannot believe you hit our kids .
what is wrong with you?
they called my bluff .
what was i supposed to do?
oh , yeah , dave , that makes sense .
anytime anybody calls your bluff , you should just beat the crap out of them .
come on , it was just a tap .
i wouldn't ever actually hurt him .
i barely even touched him .
sweetie , where are you going?
dad beat me up , so i'm moving to kenny's .
beat you up .
i'm not going to live in a house where i have to sleep with one eye open .
i barely even touched you .
it was nothing .
come on , tell her .
honey , honey , can't ...
you .
what?
he did what?
he hit me .
three times , really hard !
okay , it didn't really hurt , but it was humiliating .
he just thinks he can get away with this 'cause he thinks i'm a wuss .
well , i showed him .
i packed my bags and walked right out of there .
that is very unsettling .
so can i stay here with you guys for a while?
you can stay as long as you want , right , mom?
of course .
now , kenny , do your homework and your chores , then you can watch 15 minutes of tv .
thanks , mom .
15 minutes of tv?
it's not so bad .
so , which half of that '70s show do you want to watch?
mr. gold?
yeah?
i'm eartha marshall .
i work at child services .
no , thanks , i already have three .
i'm told there's been an incident .
and then he said he didn't care if he even went on the father son ski trip .
and then hillary , she comes in with this henna tattoo .
and i had to do something to get back control .
why aren't you writing that down?
when you hit larry , was it open fist , closed fist , with a belt?
it was with remorse .
there was no fist at all .
it was a love tap , really .
i just gave him a little swat on the butt .
that she writes down .
look , nothing happened .
this is totally being blown out of proportion .
so you witnessed the incident?
no , no , i wasn't around .
mother not around .
it's you .
is larry here?
maybe he is , maybe he isn't .
just get him .
what do you want?
i'm here for larry .
larry , quickly lock yourself in the bathroom !
i will call nine hundred and eleven .
what's the matter with you?
larry , come on , okay?
let's go home .
this is my home now .
oh , you're being ridiculous , okay?
i want you to come home , right now .
or what?
you'll cut off his feet and put them up on sticks , huh?
barbarian .
oh , i barely touched him .
and i know it was you who called child services , you whack job .
dad?
okay , so you wanted to meet keith , here he is .
it's a pleasure to meet you , mr. gold .
you're keith?
uh , yeah .
yeah?
crack whore keith?
uh , you know , actually we changed our name .
it turns out there was another band named crack whore , so now we're calling ourselves the grateful dead .
isn't he great?
yeah , yeah .
you're , uh ... you're not all that i pictured .
your hair's not that long .
you smell okay .
your pants aren't hanging below your ass .
you know , sir , i understand why you'd have that impression , but that's not me .
i'm a straight a student .
i'm going to princeton in the fall .
ah .
princeton , huh?
yes .
and , hey , don't worry , i'll treat hillary with the respect she deserves .
ah .
well , you better treat her better than that .
oh , i'm just teasing you , sweetie .
oh , it's just a joke .
and , hey , i promise you , if her curfew is 10 : 00 ,
i'm gonna make sure she's homeat 9 : 58 , all right?
keith , will you marry my daughter and make me the happiest man on earth?
what do you mean you're coming home?
you can't ; it'll ruin everything .
but i hate it at kenny's .
his parents make me do chores , and they don't let me eat candy or drink soda .
i'd rather be hit .
larry , you can't let dad win .
our futures depend on this .
actually ...
dad really isn't that bad , especially compared to most of my friends 'fathers .
i mean , how horrible must we have been lately to make him hit us?
me .
make him hit me .
maybe we should just cut dad some slack you know , not give him such a hard time .
do not go soft on me !
okay?
larry getting his ass beat is the best thing that's ever happened to us .
it's not the best thing that's ever happened to me .
this isn't about you .
look , now that child services has a file on mom and dad , they're totally powerless against us .
and if larry gets dad to apologize , he'll be a completely broken man .
we'll have total free rein .
but i want to come home .
i want soda .
i want to watch the o. c.
are you forgetting what dad did to you?
are you going to be a wuss and let him get away with that?
hey , don't call me a wuss !
you're right , i hate dad .
that's right , you hate him , all right .
he ruined your life .
so go back there , stay there , and stay angry .
i will .
yeah , you will .
i mean , who decided all of a sudden that giving your kid a little swat on the behind was child abuse?
it's crazy .
tell me about it .
your father spanked you when you were a kid , right?
many times .
and it didn't " permanently damage " you , did it?
not at all .
exactly .
and you've spanked your kids , haven't you?
but you did threaten to spank them , right?
no , dave .
i love my kids .
i'd never hit them or threaten them with violence .
i did spank my wife once , though .
but in all fairness , that was her idea .
look , you didn't deserve to get spanked .
you're a good kid , and it won't happen anymore , okay?
so i want you to come home now .
i don't think so .
come on , larry , i apologized , all right?
i want to go home , and i want to go home right now .
why should i care?
because i'm your father , and i said so .
not good enough .
larry , look , i'm going to count to three , okay?
and if you don't go inside and get your stuff ...
what , you're gonna hit me?
just do it , okay?
one ... two ...
back off !
that's it larry , you're gonna do what i tell you to do , and you're going to do it now .
get out of my face !
larry , i'm not playing around ...
what the ...
i'm bleeding?
well , i apologized to larry .
hope you're happy .
thank you .
okay , honey , i want you to come home now .
i i can't .
he hates me now .
dad must get mad at you sometimes .
what do you do to make him forgive you?
yeah , that's not going to work for you , larry .
can't you at least talk to him for me?
well , this is something you're going to have to do yourself .
i think this is one of those man to man things .
great , not only do i have to talk to him , i have to be a man , too?
honey , you can't stay here forever .
i don't know about that .
that better be a can of goat milk .
all right , let's go .
dad?
yeah .
about before , um ...
well , i ...
i didn't mean to ...
i didn't know what to ...
forget it .
what?
don't worry about it , okay?
we're good .
really?
yeah .
oh , okay .
dad?
yeah .
thanks .
to be honest , i'm proud of him .
when he punched me , he became a man .
if you overlook the running away and squealing like a little girl part .
mom .
i thought you guys were going to the movies .
yeah , we were going to , but then your dad found out it was subtitled , and suddenly , he was too tired .
ah !
who's this little angel?
hey , hey , keith .
hey , who do we have here?
who is this little oh , my goodness gracious .
look at this little baby .
you are so sweet .
yes , you are .
is this your little sister?
she's so cute .
oh , actually , she's not my sister .
oh , really?
she your little niece?
no , um ...
you know , she's actually ... uh , well , she's kind of ... you know , my daughter .
he has a baby?
did i not mention that?
