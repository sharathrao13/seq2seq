i'm not the only one .
i didn't know that i had chained myselffor life ... to a noble but merciless master .
when god hands you a gift , he also hands you a whip ... and the whip is intended only for self flagellation .

i don't understand .
what my colleague means is thatyour husband's organs ... couldsave otherpatients'lives .
but weneed yourauthorization forthat .
youcouldgivehim a transplant?
notexactly .

i nearly asked for that as a birthday present .
i'm not sure it would be a nice present .
you're wrong .
it would be the best one .

i went after my son's heart .

i looked in the files ... until i found the name and address ofthe transplant recipient .
you shouldn't have .
it was wrong , and the best way to go crazy .
look at me , damn it !

the best thing for me is to quit the nto and leave madrid .
i didn't say that .
butyou think it and you're right .
i think i won't even unpack .

eighteen years not a word , not a letter , not a fucking call .
i thoughtyou were dead , bitch !
you can tell me everything at home .
we'll stop by a drugstore first .
can we get a taxi here?

with any luck , we won't get mugged on the way .
you got the knife?
yes , and a rock in my purse .
hey , there , bonanit .
look , i'm sorry i wokeyou .
hey , come over here .
no .
what doyou want?
we're not going to eatyou .
what doyou want?
let me do the talking .
povidone iodine , approximation sutures ...
thrombocid , sterilized gauze and
you got any alcohol?
no , i drank it all last night .
i mean for disinfecting .
no .
i've got vaseline , condoms and lots ofbandages .
anything else?
alcohol , please .
oh , manolita !
the barceloneta !
those were the days !
you remember?
yes .
please , don't moveyour head .
you know anything about her?
about who?
lola?
unfortunately .
what happened?
i took her in .
she was in a bad way .
as usual , with all the shit she takes .
i came back from working the field all night ... and she'd cleaned the place out .
watches, jewelry , '70s magazines that were my inspiration .
300, 000 pesetas .
what hurt most was ... she took a statue ofthe virgin that my mother gave me .
what for?
she doesn't believe in anything !
unless she's in a satanic sect and wanted it for some ritual .
i see she hasn't changed .
to do that to me , with all she owes me !
since we met in paris 20 years ago , i've been like a sister to her .
we got our tits together .
you know better than anyone .
you never saw her again?
no , and i don't want to .
areyou looking for her?
yes .
we've got unsettled business .
why did you go offlike that?
won'tyou tell me anything?
i can't .
some other day .
all right .
just don't disappear again .
i like to say good bye to the people i love ... even ifit's only to cry my eyes out , bitch .
i can't believe it .
i look like the elephant man !
don't exaggerate .
it'sjust a bit swollen .
a bit swollen?
where can i go with a mug like this?
come and eat something .
why did you go to all this trouble?
salad how wonderful !
it really hurts to chew !
i won't be able to suck .
you shouldn't work today .
what can i do?
lola cleaned me out .
i have to work .
look , caramel spread !
and meat pie !
and myprovoleta .
i have to work too .
ifyou want , we can look together .
oh , yes !
sinceyou left , i haven't had a decent meal .
well , also , as a model , i have to watch my figure .
the worst thing about this work is you've got to look cute ... and keep up with the latest advances in surgery and cosmetics .
you look terrific !
nothing like a chanel to makeyou feel respectable .
you look it .
don't i look a bit ofa slut in this suit?
all the better .
these nuns only help whores and transvestites .
is that a real chanel?
no !
how could i buy a real chanel with all the hunger in the world !
all i have that's real are my feelings ... and these pints ofsilicone that weigh a ton .
i feel so old , manolita , and it isn't my age .
it's because ofthe beating .
the beating i've taken for the last 40 years !
hello .
come in .
areyou looking for someone , or can i help?
we want to see the girl who goes to the field .
the cute one .
sister rosa .
she's inside .
go on in .
thankyou .
rosa , look .
visitors .
what happened toyour face?
nothing .
a beating .
occupational hazard .
can we talk?
ofcourse .
let's go next door .
it's quieter .
my friend and i want to quit the street ... but we need to work .
cleaning stairs , whatever .
we don't care .
there isn't much else .
well , garbage collector , or learning handicrafts here .
embroidered tablecloths , dried flowers .
i think i prefer garbage collector .
what can you do , apart from the street?
i've worked as a cook .
she's practically a surgeon .
look at this face .
she did it .
better than pitanguy .
she's a compatriot of lola's .
really?
haveyou heard anything about her?
i haven't seen her in 1 8 years .
she cleaned out my place .
she was here .
it must have been about four months ago .
we helped her through detox .
i cared for her through withdrawal ... but then shejust disappeared .
i'd like to see her before i go to el salvador .
el salvador?
maybe i'll sign on .
i always thought i could make it big in the third world .
then come with me .
i won't be so alone .
the street's getting worse here every day .
the whores were bad enough , but the drag queens are wiping us out .
i can't stand the drag queens .
they're sleazebags .
they confuse transvestism with a circus .
worse , with mime !
a woman is her hair , her nails ...
lips for sucking or for bitching .
i mean , haveyou ever seen a bald woman?
i can't stand them .
they're all sleazebags !
i doubt there are many drag queens in el salvador ... but they're in the middle ofa war .
yeah?
i didn't know that .
i'm replacing some nuns who were murdered .
i'm not sure what i need right now is a war .
you're terrible , agrado .
soyou were a cook .
yes .
who?
this one?
the best !
what a surprise !
hi , mom .
are we interrupting?
it doesn't matter .
we seeyou so rarely .
this is manuela .
pleased to meetyou .
come inside .
don'tjust stand there .
mom , manuela is a cook ... and as florinda's gone , i thought
thankyou , darling .
vicenta and i can manage .
but how?
dad alone needs two people .
where is he?
out with the dog .
on their own?
ofcourse .
what ifthey get lost?
the dog knows the way home .
don't worry .
what a shame !
i reallywanted to see them .
we'll go look for them , but first we have to talk .
come into the studio .
i'm sorryyou came for nothing .
it's all right .
try her for a few days .
think of dad .
manuela's a nurse .
as well as a cook?
yes .
i prefer to look afteryour father myself .
i understand .
thankyou anyway .
i'll go .
good bye .
manuela .
yes?
wait here .
i won't be long .
how dareyou bring a whore here !
it isn't easy to find help who'll put up with you .
but a whore !
that's no reason to be so rude .
i don't like strangers to see me forging chagalls .
can'tyou understand?
manuela isn't a whore anymore .
she's given it up .
how long haveyou known her?
since this morning .
this morning?
you're incredible .
mywork is to help people ... even ifl'vejust met them .
well , mine isn't .
don't look at me like that .
it doesn't mean i'm intolerant .
i'll makeyou a deal .
a deal?
i'll give that woman a chance ifyou don't go to el salvador .
mom , don't give me any more doubts .
i've got enough .
and soyou should .
that trip is suicide !
no , it's parricide !
well , i have to go .
manuela's waiting .
sure !
anywhore , any salvadoran , is more important than your parents !
don't start , mom .
you should go see a psychiatrist .
it wouldn't do either ofus any harm .
didn'tyou want to see your father and the dog?
another day .
areyou all right?
good bye , mom .
hello , vicenta .
rosa , love .
you're so thin .
aren'tyou eating?
yes , i am .

no .
so long .

i guess so .
you look awful .
i don't feel verywell .
i want to throw up .

i just saw her run out .
she said she'd wait for me in her dressing room !
i can't believe it .
it's only been two weeks .
she can't do this to me .
haveyou got a car?
no .
where doyou want to go?
i don't know .
can you drive?
yes .
don't tell anyone , but nina's got problems withjunk .
doyou know where she'd go to score at this time?
no , but it's easy to find out .
thankyou .
whoeveryou are ...
i have always depended on the kindness ofstrangers .
i can't drive .
nina does the driving .
want one?
no , thankyou .
i started smoking because of bette davis .
to imitate her .
at 1 8 , i was smoking like a chimney .
that's why i called myself huma .
huma's a very pretty name .
smoke is all there's been in my life .
you've had success too .
success has got no taste or smell .
and when you get used to it , it's as ifit didn't exist .
god , where has that girl gone?
i think that's her !
you stay here .
i'll go .
he's a son ofa bitch .
he rips everybody off .
yeah , and since i'm not from here

soyou're back on the street .
just when i'd found anotherway foryou to earn money .
tell me .
i'm not a whore .
i've been fucked around a lot , but i'm not a whore .
why did you lie to me?
it was agrado's idea .
the dress was hers too .
what's this otherway for me to earn money?
i'm dying ofcuriosity .
how much would you charge to rent me a room?
to rentyou a room?
why?
i'm going to leave the center for a few months .
what about el salvador?
i don't feel well .
i can't travel like this .
why doyou want to move in here ifyou're ill?
i'm pregnant .
pregnant?
what areyou going to do?
have it , ofcourse .
what doyou expect?
i thought it'd be less ofa scandal here .
can't the father helpyou out?
the father !
god knows where he is .
butyou know who he is , don'tyou?
ofcourse .
who doyou take me for?
i'm sorry .
it was your compatriot lola .
that lousy , fucking bitch !
what's come overyou?
what's come over me?
how far along areyou?
three months , i think .
but i'm veryworried .
worried?
i'm not surprised !

i'm going to the hospital del mar tomorrow .
i wanted to know ifyou'd come with me .
yes , ofcourse .
thankyou .
what about the room?
i'm sorry .
you can't stay here .
good evening .

hello !
i was expecting you .
i didn't know where to send your purse .
here it is .
thankyou .

yes , everything .
thankyou for last night .
not at all .
i'd love to talk more , but i'm short on time .
can i helpyou?
could you button this?
ofcourse .
what was your name?
would you like to work for me?
doing what?
everything .
everything except sleep with me .
i've got enough with nina .
well , the truth is i was looking for ajob .
i need a personal assistant .
someone i can trust .
you don't know me .
what i saw last night was enough .
but nina hates me .
nina hates everyone , including herselfand me .
well ... when do i start?
right now , ifyou can .
all right .
ask nina what she wants for dinner .
i'll just have an esqueixada .
anything else?
could you get a tranquilizer for nina?
she's real edgy today .
i've got lexatin .
terrific !
don't mention the father .
why doyou dislike lola so much?
lola's got the worst ofa man ... and the worst ofa woman .
i'll tell you a story .
i had a friend who got married veryyoung .
after a year , her husband went to work in paris ... and he was to call her when he got settled .
twoyears passed .
the husband saved some money and came to barcelona to open a bar .
she came here tojoin him .
twoyears isn't a long time ... but the husband had changed .
he didn't love her anymore .
the change was more physical .
he'd gotten a pair oftits that were bigger than hers .
oh , i see .
my friend was veryyoung .
she was in a foreign land .
she had no one .
apart from the tits , the husband hadn't changed that much ... so she ended up accepting him .
women will do anything to avoid being alone .
women are more tolerant , but that's good .
we're assholes ... and a bit lesbo .
listen to the end ofthe story .
my friend and her husband with the tits ... set up a bar here , on the barceloneta .
he spent the day in a tiny bikini , screwing everything he could ... and giving her a hard time ifshe wore a bikini ... or even a miniskirt .
the bastard !
how could someone act so macho with a pair oftits like that?
sit down .
who is the patient?
she is .
well?
my sister is pregnant .
we reckon she's about three months along .
this is her first checkup .
yesterday and today i bled a little .
lie down on the couch , and strip from the waist down .
don't worry .
put this on .
thankyou .
according to the ultrasound , the fetus seems to be fine .
doyou live together?
no .
yes .
which is it?
she lives with our mother , but she hasn't told her anything yet .
is your blood pressure usually high?
yes , i have hypertension .
there's a risk ofmiscarriage .
you must move as little as possible .
but i've got to do myjob .
your onlyjob now is to rest and not do anything stupid .
tell your mother to watch her blood pressure .
she has to follow a salt free diet and rest .
i'll tell her .
listen , doctor , i work with people who are high risk ... so i'd like to have an ai ds test as well .
what's yourjob?
she's a social worker .
when can we pick up the results?
in two weeks 'time .
you have to tell your mother .
you need to be looked after .
i found ajobyesterday , and i'm going to be busy all day .
listen .
you've no right to ask me to beyour mother .
you've already got one , even ifyou don't like her .
we can't choose our parents .
they are who they are .
oh , god !
please , don't blackmail me !
idon'tknowifi was right to call the clinic .
whatelse couldyoudo?
ican'tbelieveher andgo onliving withstanley .
then don't believe her .
what matters is you and your baby .
what ifshe told me the truth?
blanche?
blanche is in no shape to tell the truth ... even ifshe wanted to , poor thing .
where is my heart?
she means herjewel box .
it's heart shaped .
i think it's here somewhere .
look , here it is .
i need a necklace .
we'll look for it .
what's the gentleman's name?
huntleigh .
did he call while i was in the bathroom?
no .
how strange !
why areyou looking at me like that?
do i look awful?
no , you look better than ever .
i'll look betterwith this necklace .

i don't where they are .
i was at the tv studio all day .
where's nina?
wasn't she with you?
i just left her at home , in bed .
in bed?
what's wrong?
i think it's food poisoning .
she was so ill this morning .
why didn'tyou tell me when i called?
we didn't want to upsetyou .
has a doctor seen her?
yes .
she's got gastroenteritis , but she'll be fine tomorrow .
so we cancel the show?
i'd like to speak to huma , please .
yes , wait outside .
five minutes .
all right !
tell me the truth .
she's bombed .
she can't even speak .
she went out afteryou did .
she didn't know i'd drop by .
she thought i'd be with you .
what do we do now?
ifit won't giveyou a heart attack , i could do her part .
i know it by heart from hearing it over the loudspeakers .
but can you act?
i can lie verywell , and i'm used to improvising .
i've seen that .

i'm tired ofyou two whispering behind my back all the time !

let go .
you've torn my shirt !
brute !
brute?
i was a brute when we met .
but i'd remind you that it was never a problem foryou .
one dayyou showed me a picture ofyour house ... a mansion with lots ofcolumns .
i pulled you down offthose columns and taughtyou to be happy .
we laughed and were happy together ... until your sister blanche appeared .
what's wrong?
take me to the hospital , please !
congratulations on last night .
i heard you were great .
you can't imagine .
what a pityyou weren't there .
i felt awful .
agrado called to tell me about it .
she must have called halfof barcelona !

i just saw him .

i went for my results .
i forgot it was today .
i'm hlv positive .
we'll have the tests redone .
why the hell did you screw lola?
don'tyou know she's been shooting up for 1 5 years?
what world doyou think you're living in?
i don't know .

thankyou .
good evening .
here's miss goodytwo shoes .
what's up?
what's up?
you planned it all , you bitch !
nina , don't be so rude .
just like eve harrington .
you learned the part on purpose .
it's fucking impossible to learn it over the loudspeakers .
you think i'm stupid?
the loudspeakers helped me remember it .
i've known the part ofstella foryears .
really?
what a coincidence !
ifyou only knew .
what did i tell you?
whywereyou here that first night?
orwas that a coincidence too?
no , it wasn't a coincidence .
i won't botheryou anymore .
i'll get my things and go .
manuela , i thinkyou owe us an explanation .
a streetcarnameddesire has marked my life .
twentyyears ago , i played stella with an amateur group .
that's where i met my husband .
he was playing kowalski .
two months ago , i sawyourversion in madrid .
i went with my son .
it was the night ofhis birthday .
it was pouring rain , but we waited outside ... because he wanted your autograph , huma .
it was crazy to wait in the rain ... but it was his birthday , so i couldn't say no .
you two got in a taxi , and he ran afteryou .
a car coming along the street ran him down .
he was killed .
that's the explanation .
that's the explanation , huma .
move , rosa .
i can't get past .
what areyou doing here?
hello .
i came to payyou .
you leftyesterday withoutyour money .
this is my sister rosa .
hello .
how areyou?
let me helpyou .
let's get the elevator .
where's nina?
i left herwith mario .
she says hi .
leave the bags here .
you go and rest for a while , rosa .
i'm not tired .
don't argue .
sit down .
anything to drink?
no , thankyou .
she's like a little girl .
i couldn't sleep all night thinking aboutyour son .
i can remember his face in the rain perfectly ... and the notebook in his hand .
i can see him now .
i don't want to talk about my son .
i can't .
apart from apologizing , nina and and i wantyou to come back .
rosa's sick .
she needs someone to look after her all day .
i can't leave her .
i'm sorry .
i don't know what i should do .
why don'tyou check nina into a clinic?
ifwe don't fulfill the contract , the companywill sue me .
find a replacement ... and finish your run with the company .
i can't do the play without nina .
she's hooked onjunk , but i'm hooked on her .
who was it?
agrado .
and you let her in?
you should have said we were busy .
i'm thinking ofyou .
come on , lie down here and stop moving around .
what exactly is wrong with you?
an accident .
what kind?
why didn't i think ofit before?
agrado could take my place .
ofcourse !
the oneyou didn't want to let in?
that's something between us , but she's perfect foryou .
how old is agrado?
pretty old .
between thirty and fifty .
is agrado her real name?
no , it's a stage name .
like huma .
you know why i took the name huma?
yes .
manuela told me .
what else did she tell you?
everything .
she told me everything .
aboutyou and nina ... thejunk ... and that it'll end badly .
really?
and what else did she say?
i'm very curious .
that as an actress , you're wonderful ... but that as a person , you're very mixed up .
and what else?
that i shouldn't say anything .
what haveyou got in the bag?
cava and ice cream .
what for?
to celebrateyour success last night , bitch .
thankyou .
come in .
oh , what a surprise !
three single girls in an empty house ... always reminds me of how to marrya millionaire .
how areyou , sister rosa?
huma , this is agrado .
my pleasure .
i'm " fans .
how areyou?
huma , you're a goddess , a living legend .
like i said , i'm " fans , " in the plural ... but my manuela was too much the other night .
how i bawled at the evening show !
shouldn'tyou be in el salvador?
yes , but i'm not going now .
i'm staying here .
agrado , i don't work for huma anymore .
beforeyou came , we were saying thatyou could take my place .
me play stella?
i see myselfmore as blanche .
replacing me , not nina , and much less huma .
thankyou , manuela , but i don't
try her for a few days .
she isn't as clueless as she seems .
i am , huma , and worse .
right now , i don't get this at all .
so i'll giveyou the bottle to cheer us up a bit .
i brought ice cream .
come on , let's have a drink and relax a bit .
i'll get the glasses .
i'll just have some ice cream .
i can't drink alcohol .
well , i'll have a drink .
hey , what's up with manuela?
she seems very odd .
success hasn't gone to her head already , has it?
she wants to dumpyou on huma .
i think prada is ideal for a nun .
my problem is everything suits me , so i'm very eclectic .
i've had chilblains since i came to barcelona .
oh , really?
it's finished .
should i get more?
i'd love some , but no .
where's the bathroom?
straight ahead .
excuse me .
fill me in on what's happening here .
i'm no stranger .
i'll tell you tomorrow .
no , don't !
she can't keep her mouth shut .
i know verywell how to keep it shut .
i played along like an english lady so she wouldn't catch on .
i'm a model ofdiscretion , even when i'm sucking someone's cock .
i've sucked a lot ofcocks in public places ... and no one's noticed , except the person involved .
it's been ages since i sucked a cock !
i love the word " cock .
and " prick " !
i have to go .
areyou all right?
what?
areyou all right?
better than ever .
can you help her find a taxi?
i nearly forgot .
this is foryou .
thankyou .
well , good bye , girls .
so long .
you have to teach me how to bark .
i think i was a bit rude to huma .
i said all sorts ofthings .
really?
it doesn't matter .
they're very different for sisters , aren't they?
are they sisters?
that's what manuela said .
well , ifshe says so .
i thinkyou're all bullshitters .
you have to get to know us .
can you drive?
i used to be a truck driver .
really?
in paris , before i got my tits .
then i gave up the truck and became a whore .
how interesting .
very .
a check .
1 50, 000 .
how generous !
what is it?
huma's autograph , for esteban .
this is theautograph inevergaveyou ... andnotbecause youdidn't try .
ihavebeen foolish , casting mypearlsbeforeswine .
youmeanme?
youandyour friend , mr. mitchell .
he came toseeme andrepeatedtheslanderyou'dtoldhim .
so i threwhim out .
you threwmitch out?
he returned with a box ofroses to beg my forgiveness . " forgive me , " he said , but some things are not forgivable .
cruelty is not forgivable .
it is the one unforgivable thing .
well?
areyou learning the part too?
ofcourse not .
you should, just in case .
you think so?
may i have some privacy?
soyou can getyour fix?
can't wait till the end?
ifyou know , why ask?
ifyou don't want me to tell huma , do it in the bathroom .
i don't need to see these things .
all right .
keep an eye on the door .
i know that when you'reyoung well , you're no child you don't value these things .
butyou're cute , nicely proportioned kind ofsmall , but cute .
you've lost weight well , it's all the drugs but the important thing is you've lost weight .
you've got talent
limited talent , butyou've got it .
and , above all , a woman who loves you .
and you trade it all forjunk .
you think it's worth it?
well , it isn't .
it isn't worth it .
i trade it for a bit ofpeace .
come on , help me .
you're getting flat as a board .
compared toyou .
what a dirty habit !
haven'tyou ever thought ofcutting it off?
i'd get no work .
the clients like us pneumatic and well hung .
rheumatic?
guys are so odd .
not rheumatic .
pneumatic .
a pair oftits as hard as newly inflated tires ... and a big dick as well .
show meyour cock .
that fix didn't agree with you .
maybe i'll like it too .
you've got enough problems as it is .
go , you're on now .
and don't throw up on anybody .
the audience loves it .
they think it's because i'm pregnant .
you're not pregnant in this scene .
you've had a doll .
that's right .
will you show me your cock later?
i'll show it toyou and you can lick it .
young people will try anything !
months later
i'm going to call him esteban .
your son?
why?
afteryours .
this babywill belong to both ofus .
ifonly he did .
ifonlywe were alone in the world ... without any commitments .
you and your son , just for me .
butyou have a family .
i'm going to fixyour hair and makeyou up a bit .
why?
i like to seeyou look nice .
and i called your mother .
she's coming to seeyou today .
my mother?
you have a mother .
don'tyou remember?
what will i tell her?
thatyou love her i don't know .
come in , huma .
no , it isn't huma .
may i come in?
ofcourse , mario .
come in .
you're very early today .
yes .
what areyou doing?
just a bit ofironing .
is anything wrong?
i didn't sleep verywell last night .
i've been on edge all day .
would you give me a blowjob?
can'tyou all get it intoyour heads that i'm retired?
i don't wantyou to think that ... but since i've been on edge all day ...
i think a blowjob would relax me .
you give me one .
i'm on edge too .
well , it would be the first time i've sucked a woman's cock ... but ifthat's what it takes
the whole company is obsessed with my cock !
it isn't the only one around .
don'tyou have a cock?
yes .
do people askyou to suck their cocks becauseyou've got one?
do they?
no .
well , then?
look , i'll suckyou off to showyou how open minded ... and how sensitive i am about these things .
where's the fucking phone?
hello?
all right , don't worry .
i'll see to everything .
shall we go to my room?
in case huma comes
huma can't come .
she's in the hospital , along with nina .
what's happened?
they nearly killed each other .
fuck !
here .
we'll have to cancel the performance .
don't say anything .
we have to say something .
yes , but it doesn't have to be the truth .
i'll make something up .
right .
and
hello , how areyou?
hello .
come in .
where is she?
there , in the bedroom .
and here i was so worried , thinking you were in el salvador .
i seeyou've learned to lie .
i didn't know how to tell you .
what areyou going to do now?
leave the order?
get married?
mom , the things you ask !
one never knows with you .
at least , i don't .
even this i had to learn about through your friend .
what would i have done without her?
how's dad?
same as ever .
i don't know .
worse .
ifyou don't mind , i'd rather not tell him anything .
he wouldn't get it anyway .
and sapic?
fine .
rosa , i don't know what to do .
what doyou expect me to do?
nothing , mom .
you don't expect anything from me?
it isn't that .
what i mean is don't make it harder for me .
would you like anything?
i'm making tea .
no , thankyou .
what exactly is wrong?
i didn't understand over the phone .
according to the ultrasound , she's got placenta previa .
when the time comes , she'll need a caesarian .
in the meantime , she must have complete rest .
doyou think i should take her home?
i have to look after her father as ifhe were a child .
you're her mother ... but i think rosa's better offhere .
that's the impression she gave me .
ifyou need money , just ask me .
and , please , keep me informed .
yes .
don't worry .
thankyou very much .
i'll seeyou out .
no , really .
i don't know what i did wrong with rosa .
ever since she was born , she's been like an alien .
doyou have children?
yes , one .
doyou get along well with him?
he died .
i'm sorry .
due to reasons beyond their control ... two ofthe actresses who triumph daily on this stage ... cannot be here tonight the poor things .
so the show has been cancelled .
those who wish can get their money back ... but for those who have nothing better to do ... it's a shame to waste the rare occasion thatyou make it to the theater .
ifyou stay ...
i promise to entertain you with my life story .
good bye .
i'm very sorry .
ifi boreyou , you can pretend to snore like this .
i'll get the idea , and you certainly won't hurt my feelings .
honestly .
they call me " la agrado " ... because i've always tried to make people's lives agreeable .
as well as being agreeable , i'm very authentic !
look at this body !
all made to measure .
almond shaped eyes 80, 000 .
nose 200, 000 .
a waste ofmoney .
another beating the following year left it like this .
it gives me character , but ifl'd known ...
i wouldn't have touched it .
i'll continue .
tits two , because i'm no monster .
70, 000 each , but i've more than earned that back .
silicone in
where?
lips , forehead , cheeks ... hips and ass .
a pint costs about 1 00, 000 ... soyou work it out , because i've lost count .
jaw reduction 75, 000 .
complete laser depilation ... because women , like men , also come from apes .
60, 000 a session .
it depends how hairyyou are .
usually , two to four sessions .
but ifyou're a flamenco diva , you'll need more .
well , as i was saying ... it costs a lot to be authentic , ma'am .
and one can't be stingy with these things ... becauseyou are more authentic ... the moreyou resemble whatyou've dreamed ofbeing .
i'll turn you around .
please , be careful .
don't worry .
we'll lift up a bit .
that's it .
areyou all right?
yes .
ifyou can push it over here
i'll put this away .
thankyou .
can you manage?
yes .
to the hospital del mar , please .
can we go through medinaceli square?
aren't we meeting your mother at the hospital?
i just want to see the square .
all right .
stop here !
i played here as a child .
sapic !
come here , boy !
hello , sapic .
that dog would go with anybody .
doyou have a dog?
no , but i really like them .
how old areyou?
twenty six .
and how tall areyou?
not very .
five six .
come on .
go on .
go back to dad .
come on .
good bye , dad .
you aren't in any pain?
no .
that's great .
painless childbirth .
when is she going into surgery?
in an hour and a half .
i've got time to go check on your father and come back .
you don't have to come back , mom .
i want to be here with you .
give dad a kiss for me .
i'm keeping this one .
so long .
good bye .
i hope the third esteban is the definitive one foryou .
the third esteban?
lola was the first ... and your son , the second .
soyou knew lola was the father ofmy son too .
ofcourse .
it didn't take a genius .
lola doesn't know we had a son .
i never told him .
did your son know?
no , he didn't .
let's not talk about sad things .
this is a great day .
they've put videla injail , and your son's going to be born .
promise me one thing .
what?
ifanything happens  what could happen?
promiseyou won't hide anything from the child .
i don't have to .
you can tell him whateveryou wantyourself .
promise me .
ifit makes you happier .
all right .
i promise .
we are here today to say good bye to our sister rosa .
manuela , i'm so happy to seeyou .
what a pity it has to be here .
it couldn't be anywhere else .
you aren't a human being , lola .
you're an epidemic !
i was always excessive .
and i'm very tired .
manuela , i'm dying .
come .
i'm saying good bye to everything .
i robbed agrado to pay my ticket to argentina .
i wanted to take a last look at the town ... the river ... our street .
and i'm happy i can say good bye toyou too .
now i just have to see sister rosa's child .
my son .
i always dreamed ofhaving a son .
you know that .
when i left barcelona , i was carrying your child .
what?
you mean you too
did you have it?
a beautiful boy .
i want to see him .
did you bring him with you?
he's in madrid , butyou can't see him .
even from a distance .
i promise he won't see me .
it's the last thing i ask ofyou .
you can't see him .
please !
six months ago , he was run over by a car .
he's dead .
i only came to barcelona to tell you .
i'm sorry .
the baby !
where haveyou been?
haven'tyou taken sapic outyet?
you weren't here .
i'm here now .
he's hungry .
the bottle's heating .
will you get it , please?
come here .
vicenta , don't let my husband come in here , please .
he's convinced the baby's yours .
yes , i know .
he's veryjealous .
i told him the babywas yours .
i don't dare tell him the truth .
he wouldn't understand anyway .
ifonly he were mine .
what is it?
who's that woman?
it's manuela , the new cook .
she's been with us four days .
we've fixed up this room so she can be here with her child .
remember?
i told you .
how old areyou?
thirty eight .
how tall areyou?
five seven .
all right .
nowyou can go for a walk .
go on .
thereyou are .
the bottle , ma'am .
thankyou .
thankyou .
no , no .
we're going to eat now .
yes?
don't tell anyone about the antibodies .
do the nuns know?
all right .
one month later
hello , lola .
take him .
what did the doctor say?
he's fine .
you can see he's normal .
you're with dad .
can i give him a kiss?
ofcourse .
my son , i'm sorry to leaveyou such an awful inheritance .
don't say that .
there's no reason why he should develop the disease .
this is our esteban .
you called him esteban too?
thankyou .
he wanted to be a writer .
this is his notebook .
he took it with him everywhere .
he wrote this the morning ofthe day he died .
read it .
last night mom showed me a picture .
halfofit was missing .
i didn't want to tell her , but my life is missing that same half .
keep reading .
this morning i looked through her drawers ... and found a bundle ofpictures .
theywere all missing a half .
my father , i suppose .
i want to meet him .
i have to make mom understand that i don't care who he is ... orwhat he's like ... or how he behaved towards her .
she can't deny me that right .
keep the picture .
thankyou .
i don't likejust anyone kissing the baby .
who was that woman in the barwith you?
that woman is his father .
what did you say?
that was his father , and he's very ill .
that monster is the one who killed my daughter?
don't think about that , rosa .
there are people who think children are made in a day .
but it takes a long time a very long time .
that's why it's so awful to see your child's blood on the ground .
a stream that flows for a minute and yet costs us years .
when i found my son ... he was lying in the middle ofthe street .
i soaked my hands in his blood and licked them .
because it was mine .
animals lick theiryoung , don't they?
i'm not disgusted by my son .
you don't know what it's like .
in a monstrance ofglass and topaz ...
i would put the earth soaked by his blood .
keep kneading .
the sadness should go intoyour hands .
work .
you have to work .
you don't notice my cold?
no , it's fine .
come on .
you shouldn't be in here .
hello .
i've got a bouquet foragrado and huma rojo .
really?
yes .
sign here , please .
you sure it's foragrado?
yes , it says so .
here .
know why they call me agrado?
i've always tried to make life agreeable for others .
right .
running away once again with no good byes ... though i know how much you like them , agrado .
thesituation with rosa'sparents is unbearable .
thegrandmotherisafraid ascratch willinfecther .
i'm taking esteban wherehe won'tbe surroundedbyhostility .
agrado , youknow howmuch iloveyou .

i'll fix it .

an animal , but who takes care ofyou like i do?
it's great aboutyour son !
so he's neutralized the virus practically overnight .
yes .
esteban's case proves the virus can disappear .
they're still trying to find out why , but it's a miracle .
i knew it .
how i prayed for that child .
why not staywith us whileyou're in barcelona?
ofcourse .
we're staying with his grandparents .
rosa's mother is looking forward to it .
she's changed so much .
