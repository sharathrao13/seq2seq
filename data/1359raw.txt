nope .
i pulled his credit report .
you didn't .
i sure as hell did .
fred , this young brother is a stockbroker for j. p. oliver .
theresa?
i don't believe it .
marilyn said she's crazy about him .
and this boy's credit report , i'm telling you , is a thing of beauty .
i almost cried .

he probably is .
but the brother has a job .
i'm glad you think that way ...

you don't understand .
theresa , does that boy have a job?
it's a good thing i do then , huh?
i know .
i'm so excited !
aren't you excited?
theresa , a man is never excited about meeting his future father in law .
you know , i was thinking .
maybe we should postpone telling them .
what?
it was your idea .
i know .
but i'm thinking now that maybe it was a bad idea .
no , i think it's a great idea .
announcing our engagement at my parents 'party ... is gonna be the best present we can give them .
babe , mom's gonna flip .
see , i'm not worried about your mom .
i was thinking about ... him .
see , he's about ready to pop a blood vessel ... in his head , because you guys are losing a basketball game .
no , we were winning that game .
yeah .
we're bringing in a canopy here .
swags of tulle with festoons .
sprays of roses .
parquet dance floor here .
guests will be seated at tables in chiavari chairs .
very clean , very simple , very elegant .
and rose petals on the lawn .
and not just a few ... oodles .
at my wedding , we had oodles of petals .
it was fabulous .
at that wedding , was a woman involved?
of course it involved a woman .
if she's not a woman , it's gonna be a surprise to both of us .
hello !
look .
i'll tell you , this is going to be some party .
twenty five years of marriage .
more power to you , pal .
thank you .
hey , baby .
sorry i'm late .
my vice principal called in sick today ... so it was just me against 208 middle schoolers .
i swear half of them ate pure sugar for breakfast .
hi , dante .
so , percy , which one do you like best?
i like that ...
is your name percy?
which one costs the most?
they cost the same .
they don't cost the same .
this one's from saks .
this one's from macy's .
saks !
thank you .
and now i can give my honest opinion .
i'm digging that one , baby .
really?
well , that's too bad , 'cause i'm wearing this one .
hallelujah .
sweetheart .
yeah?
listen .
why do you even bother asking me?
'cause it's a big day for us and i wanted you to feel included .
why couldn't you include martha superfreak out there?
dante is a nice man .
a nice man .
a nice man that part of the time likes to sleep with other nice men .
will you stop it?
would you open your mind , percy jones?
dante is a metrosexual .
a what?
he's a straight man with taste .
no such thing .
you might as well tell me he rode over here on a unicorn .
look , serious face , serious moment .
i need to talk to you .
i know , baby .
i'm working on my vows .
almost got them perfect .
that's sweet , but that's not it .
what is it?
this boy that theresa's bringing home?
i don't know who his people are , where he's from ...
i don't know anything about him .
but what i do know is that i need you to be nice .
i'm always nice .
let's be nice long enough to find out who the boy is .
i already know who he is .
you pulled his credit report?
i did not .
you pulled his credit report , percy?
i mean , i glanced at it .
but a credit report don't tell you the character of a man .
but being a loan officer for 22 years ...
i can size that boy up in an instant .
and you know i got a knack for it .
you know that .
five seconds .
that's all i need .
that's all i need .
nobody knows that better than me .
say what?
i didn't stutter .
i'm not so good with dads , baby .
i'm good with moms .
i'm better with moms .
he's a big guy , right?
scary big .
he also has these ... piercing eyes that just burn right into your soul .
don't maintain eye contact for a long period of time .
at least today , okay?
babe , i'm kidding .
just relax .
it's gonna be fun .
okay?
did you tell them?
what?
tell them what?
babe , don't ...

pigment challenged?
did you tell them that i'm white?
you're white?
you're white?

oh , my god .
simon , i'm so sorry .
it was a joke , sir .
i was kidding .
yeah , sister .
you're funny .
simon , are you okay?
who are you?
are you serious?
why am i in jersey?
don't worry .
it's gonna be great , okay?
all right .
i'm very sorry .
it was a bad joke .
so , did you tell them?
no .
i only told them the important things .
that i love you .
that you're an amazing man .
that you have a very cute birthmark on your left butt cheek .
you just didn't feel the need to mention it's a caucasian butt cheek .
that was ...
simon , look .
i didn't mention it because i don't think it's gonna matter .
it's gonna matter .
we're fine , sir .
dad !
look at this here .
oh , my god .
give your daddy a hug .
how are you?
mom !
hey , my man .
percy jones , baby .
pleasure to meet you .
man , look at this here .
i like this , man .
nice , solid , strong grip .
wow .

no , dad , it's ...
hey , sweetheart .
you can take that to the front door for me .
thank you .
no , you see , this ...
don't interrupt .
i'm giving your friend a once over here .
sir?
don't stand like a statue .
take it to the front door .
that's that square with the hole .
look inside , you see furniture .
thank you .
yes , sir .
you doing everything in your power to make her happy?
i'm not sure if i am , but i'd sure like a crack at it .
boy , i ought to drill you , man .
i like him .
okay , all right , listen .
young man , don't worry about it .
relax .
i figure , what , $30?
get yourself some candy or something .
dad , this is simon .
simon?
that's her boyfriend's name .
that's right .
well , who are you?
wesley thompson .
that's my cab .
but if you're still down with me making your girl happy ...
i'm good to go .
why don't you just go?
just ...
i wish theresa would have told me you guys were black .
that would have saved an awkward moment .
kind of like this one .
yeah .
welcome home , sweetheart .
thanks , mom .
baby , let me get that .
i got it .
lemonade .
damn !
ain't no need , us standing out here .
why don't we go on inside and talk?
come on , we going on inside with a quickness .
no use standing out here .
just come on .
that boy's white .
nothing gets past you .
i guess it's those 22 years as a loan officer .
you knew about this .
i didn't know a thing , i promise you .
but i did figure it out after the second " daddy !
why she just didn't say nothing?
give us a warning , you know?
we taught our girls to see only people , not color .
i know that but ...
so , what's the problem?
i guess the problem is she just didn't tell us .
i'm expecting denzel washington to come walking through the door ... and i get whitey mcwhiteman instead .
hi , you guys .
hi !
i'm just showing simon the house .
you've a very beautiful home , mrs. jones .
why , thank you .
you can call me marilyn .
will do .
you , too , mr. jones .
thank you .
you can call me mr. jones .
i'm just kidding .
you got me .
that was funny .
i'm making lemonade .
you want to sit down?
yes , thank you .
sit down , babe .
great .
so , simon , they tell me you work at j. p. oliver?
yes , sir .
you like it there?
you been there long?
well , it's a couple of years , i suppose .
you moving up?
there's been some recent movement , yes .
you a hard worker?
you work hard?
the hardest .
j. p. oliver has a huge ipo coming up ...
he doesn't want to hear about this .
but he's asking you about your work .
i know , but you go into details ...
he likes to be modest .
shut up .
anyway , they made simon their ipo ...
wait , what is it?
point man?
and they're flying him to san francisco on monday .
i'm not going to see him for three days .
so , simon , what do your parents do?
yeah .
my mother is a realtor .
mom , let me help you with that .
and she sells mini blinds and teaches dance .
damn .
how many jobs your mama got?
she's a single parent .
she's always been a hard worker .
what happened to your father?
he left when i was two and i haven't seen much of him since .
i'm sorry to hear that .
it happens .
you play any sports?
i played some foosball in college .
that's the table with the soccer guys ...
i know what foosball is .
stupid joke .
it's not a sport .
dad , stop badgering him .
i'm not badgering him .
i'm just taking an interest .
i don't understand why you don't play sports?
it don't make sense .
a man who don't play sports isn't a real man , as far as i'm concerned .
i used to run a little .
what?
like track?
i mean , you don't look like a sprinter .
what'd you run?
did you steeplechase?
dad !
come on , man .
what was your race?
cars .
cars .
nascar .
nascar !
that was the one .
i had some hopes and some dreams and ... it all ended on a hot august day on a speedway in charlotte .
it was a crash .
just ...
they said i should've been killed .
actually , i got out without a scratch .
i figured that was a sign .
nascar?
mostly i just worked in the pit .
i mean , i test drove for one of the drivers some , but ...
what was his name?
jay gordon .
you drove for jeff gordon?
we called him jay or j. g. it was like a pet name .
a pit name , actually .
nascar?
i believe i said i don't like to talk about that time in my life .
nascar?
what was i supposed to do?
he was staring at me with those piercing eyes .
he was not .
it was like ... filled with piercing disappointment 'cause i don't play sports?
a man who don't play sports isn't really a man now , is he?
i had to give him something !
he's big .
he's like ...
you said he was big , but he's big big .
but why did you lie about nascar?
my father loves nascar .
it's nascar , baby .
that's , like , the whitest sport on the planet .
not anymore , simon .
there's , like , nascar and hockey .
hockey .
i should have went with hockey .
don't worry .
he'll forget about it .
he's like this with everyone .
it always takes him some time to warm up to new people .
that's all .
what are we talking about here?
by sunday , you'll be a part of this family .
i can tell he really likes you .
i don't like him .
and i really don't think the whole racial thing matters to him .
it's not that he's white .
it's not?
is this yours or mine?
that's mine and that's for later .
no .
i think it's for now .
if memory serves me right , i think it's mine .
no , simon .
take it off !
take it off right now .
it's perfect on me .
what are you doing?
look at it .
red is my color .
always has been .
look at it .
my goodness !
simon , take it off .
but it fits me so perfectly .
look , you're stretching it !
take it off right now .
it's not ruined .
it's nice .
you take it off .
i'm not joking .
you want some of this?
stop it , simon .
take it off .
you take it off .
coming in .
mom !
i'm going to tell her right now .
go and tell .
what?
he's taking simon to a hotel !
i'm paying for it .
what's the problem?
can i speak to you?
you sure can .
why are you taking him to a hotel?
you didn't see what they were about to do upstairs .
mom , we were just playing .
well , playtime is over .
mr. jones , i'm not a cross dresser .
just for the record .
a cross dresser?
no .
what are you ...
it's lingerie .
you shouldn't even be having any .
i'm a grown woman , percy !
it is not covering up the grown parts !
what !
why does the young man have to go to a hotel?
don't start with me .
this is my house and my rules .
your rules?
this house can't handle no more testosterone .
we cannot exceed the testosterone level .
we gotta keep it like that until the girls get married .
maybe even beyond that .
and i'm not suggesting anyone get married !
why can't he stay in the basement , in your room?
because that's my room !
that's my stuff down there .
how selfish .
that doesn't make sense .
it got mold , anyway .
could be black mold .
i wouldn't feel comfortable putting him at risk .
do you have any idea how ridiculous that sounds?
no , it's okay .
no , it's not okay !
what are you talking about?
look , this is your father's house .
we're gonna play it by his rules .
now , he's obviously set a testosterone standard .
and i'm going to abide by that .
you falling for that?
i'm going with you .
no , you're not gonna do that .
you don't want me to go with you?
of course i want you to !
but what?
you need to stay here .
hello?
you need to stay here .
no .
i want to be with you !
we're still here !
are you two gonna be done soon , or maybe we should have a seat?
come on , honey .
let's sit ...
you need to help your mom with the party arrangements .
we don't want to stress them out , do we?
no .
all right?
yes .
all right .
we're all set .
i'm glad you all decided .
come on , let's go .
come on , get your stuff .
let's go .
yeah .
all right .
where is he?
girl !
oh , my god .
are we being audited?
no , keisha .
what's happening?
this is simon .
this is theresa's boyfriend .
this is keisha , her little sister .
go .
nice to meet you .
oh , this ...
yes .
nice to meet you , too .
good , you all met .
take it to the car .
i'll meet you out there .
dad , theresa's boyfriend is white .
i know .
i know you know .
i just wanted to see your face when you heard it again .
not now .
don't forget we have dinner reservations .
we'll meet you over there .
she was black as the night
louie was whiter than white
danger
take a walk on the wild side
and the colored girls go doo do doo do doo
looks like rain .
nope .
those clouds look pretty threatening .
i live here .
i know the weather .
so , theresa tells me you're in charge of the loan department at the bank .
that must be a rewarding job .
i'm thinking about making a switch to a smaller company .
i just think there's less political garbage .
you think i don't deal with political garbage?
i got political garbage coming out my ass .
if i give a guy a loan , i'm married to him for 30 years .
if i deny him , i have to deal with him in church on sunday .
i know that feeling .
don't try to act like our jobs are alike .
good thing it isn't raining .
that's not rain .
it's sprinkling .
you might want to turn on the windshield wipers .
i will once it starts raining .
come on , you two , let's go .
i don't want to be late .
keisha !
coming !
why you always got to knock on my door first?
'cause you still live here .
let's go .
it's raining .
i don't wanna be late .
come on .
okay , tell me what's it like?
what's what like?
being with a white guy .
come on , keisha , what's the sex like?
yeah .
where's mom?
she's downstairs , girl .
come on !
bring it .
okay .
you know that thing they say about the size?
completely the opposite .
really?
they're huge .
and not only are their penises big , but they can sing .
when they get excited , they sing up a storm .
they know a million tunes .
they're like big ipods .
cut it out .
stop it .
keisha , seriously , is he nice?
yeah , and he's cute , too .
i know .
what about mom and dad?
mom is cool with it .
i mean , dad , he seems , you know , a little on edge , but not more than usual .
isn't he ever?
girls !
coming !
but can i just say , i love you so much right now because ...
why? ... from now on , no matter what i do , if i ...
crash dad's car , or if i ...
what's wrong? ... rob a bank ...
if i burn this house down ...
keisha . ... i won't be the one who brought home the white boy !
thank you !
mom !
can i help you with your bag , sir?
i'm okay .
i got it .
you don't trust a working man with your bag?
no , i just ...
it's just one bag .
what do you think , he'll rifle through your luggage ... and steal your toothbrush and your fancy conditioner?
no , that's not it at all .
let me tell you something .
theresa's grandfather was a bellman for over 60 years and he never stole nothing .
could you get my bag?
what , he's your slave now?
no .
did you want me to take your bag , sir?
i don't know .
next , please .
okay .
hi .
reservation for percy jones .
and that's jones with a " j "?
no , jones with a " p.
i made the reservation last week .
you knew you were gonna kick me out a week ago?
son , i knew i was gonna kick you out 24 years ago ... when the doctor announced it was a girl .
here you are .
good .
we gave your room away .
what?
check in was at 4 : 00 .
it's thursday night .
i'm quite sure you got another room available .
i'm sorry , we're completely booked and so is everyone else .
there's a shriners convention in town , actually .
may i help you with anything else , mr. pjones?
i guess i'll have to stay at your house , then .
no , there's a crack hotel downtown .
you'll be just fine .
come on .
next .
hi .
welcome to cranford .
i don't know what your basement's like ...
it's damp .
you'd hate it .
i don't think dampness is really an issue at this point .
you can't think about anything but getting back in the house with my daughter .
mr. jones , i'm in your house .
i'll obey your rules .
yeah , right .
you'll obey mr. jones now ... but when you're up at 3 : 00 in the morning ... all hot and horny , you'll obey mr. johnson .
you heard the lady .
there's no available hotel rooms in the whole town .
i'm not gonna do anything .
i swear .
put your stuff in there .
come on .
you know , dinner's in about 10 minutes .
i don't know what marilyn is like about schedule , but i know theresa is ...
stay out of that storm .
all right .
you can stay in my basement .
but you remember one thing .
these eyes , they see everything .
now get in the car .
come on , let's go .
ebony , ivory
living in perfect harmony
ivory , ebony
so , how long have you two been together?
five months .
six months .
which one is it?
well , see , theresa counts from the first day that we met .
and i count from the first ...
how's the chicken here?
it's really good .
did i tell you two girls ... that for the first dance , your father and i are gonna do the tango?
the tango?
you and dad?
you know what?
your father and i used to dance all the time when we were younger .
sweetheart , i told you we're not doing a tango .
we're already saying our vows .
that's enough .
we're doing the tango .
sorry .
i forgot to turn it off .
know what?
this is an important call .
i'm just gonna ...
no , you can take your call here .
sit down and take your call .
it's a business call .
it's boring stuff .
business is not boring .
simon , sit down and take your call .
sit down .
hello .
simon?
yeah , this is simon .
sorry i didn't get back to you earlier .
i hope theresa makes good money as a photographer .
someone started a rumor that you're being investigated ... by the securities and exchange commission .
that is so nathan to do something like that .
i think it's nathan , too ...
'cause this is the last thing he wants to see , is his best employee going to another firm .
you know me .
i'm always up for a new challenge .
are you listening to me?
you've been blackballed .
great !
guy , it's not my fault .
i'm just telling you what they told me .
i'll call you next week .
did nathan put you up for another award?
nothing .
it's embarrassing .
hello .
can i start you off with some drinks?
vodka tonic .
celebrating a great phone call .
okay .
bring him his liquor , and bring the rest of us our usual .
they have iced tea and i have my lemonade .
actually , i think i'm gonna have a glass of pinot grigio .
and i'll have a cosmo .
me , too .
okay .
bring them their alcohol and i'll have my usual lemonade .
someone has to act responsibly around here .
so , simon , i hear that you're a singer .
what are you , a soprano , an alto , or ...
no?
maybe bass?
i don't really sing .
how long can you hold a note?
he can hold a note .
really?
for a very long time .
sing something for me , baby .
are you okay?
drink some water .
jerry , nathan's got my ankles to my earlobes right now .
i'm gonna need ...
i'm gonna need some cash .
call me back as soon as you get this .
i need a favor , okay?
you've got to be kidding me .
let me see your sexy body go ...
i knew you'd be down here sooner or later .
did you bring some of that sexy lingerie for me to try?
what is wrong with you , boy?
don't you have your own underwear?
you like my space?
yeah .
it's very homey .
interesting odor .
i told you it had mold .
did you come down here for this?
having a little trouble writing your vows?
that's none of your damn business .
i'm just saying , i could maybe help you come up with something romantic .
don't start thinking that you know more about romance than i do .
with your hand holding and feeding each other food ... and wiping off each other's faces .
that's bullshit .
being married 25 years , that's real romance .
and believe me , it's a war .
brutal .
exhausting .
sounds like someone just finished their vows .
ready for lights out?
looks that way .
good night .
good night .
thank you .
you're welcome .
what are you doing?
getting ready to go to sleep .
here?
you're sleeping here?
right here .
don't you have a bed upstairs?
sure do .
so does theresa .
by me sleeping here assures me that she'll get a good night's sleep ... all alone .
good night .
sorry .
what are you doing under there?
it's just a pillow .
we might need a barrier .
a barrier for what?
i tend to move around a lot in my sleep .
how do you know you move around if you're asleep?
theresa mentioned once that ...
i mentioned it to her ... after someone else told me ... that wasn't theresa .
okay .
we can talk about this , right?
theresa and i have a ...
no , you can't talk about it . ... healthy relationship ...
stop !
we can't talk about this?
i don't wanna hear you talking about sleeping with my daughter .
you're sleeping with me now .
now , good night !
good morning .
good morning .
you're up early .
or late , depending on how you look at it .
coffee?
yes .
bless you .
i don't know how you sleep with that man .
did he get in your space?
a little bit .
did he spoon you?
it was more of a wedge maneuver .
big man likes to cuddle in his sleep .
i just wish he were a little bit more cuddly when he was awake .
you know , when my father first met percy jones , he could not stand him .
really?
but eventually they got along , right?
no .
good morning !
good morning .
good morning , babe .
i missed you .
i missed you .
did you sleep well?
yeah .
who's going with me to get some flowers?
i'll go .
me , too , if we go early , because i have to work this afternoon .
good morning !
you're looking awfully chipper this morning .
something about knowing your daughter's not being violated relaxes a man .
i thought you said that mattress hurts your back .
no , not me .
i could sleep on that mattress every night .
every single night .
good morning , boss .
got you some coffee .
so , what's the verdict?
what are you talking about?
i'm talking about theresa's new boyfriend .
what is he , a painter?
poet?
did he ask you to borrow some money?
my daughter's got great taste in men .
that new guy , he's really something .
tell me a little bit about the brother .
oh , man , thank you .
i'll tell you about the brother .
he's a big guy .
nice looking .
what's his name?
jamal .
graduated howard university .
howard?
played basketball .
he almost went pro .
till he changed his career to medicine .
there was a big write up on him in jet four years ago .
no shit .
parents from atlanta .
friends with mrs. king , dr. cosby , rev. jackson .
come on now .
go down towards the middle .
go down?
sit up a little bit .
that's it?
man , yeah .
i'm telling you , reggie .
i'm the luckiest man in jersey .
my daughter's dating the great black hope .
you got it .
that's it .
hold it right there .
i'm not gonna move .
excuse me?
boss?
simon green here to see you .
lifting , you know .
cut that off , reggie .
go on , take it out .
come on , reggie .
get on the ball around the ...
i'll be right there .
i'll be right out .
give me ...
sign something .
fred , who is simon?
a friend of theresa's , he says .
oh , shit .
he better hope jamal don't find out .
be right with you , sir .
great .
jerry?
hey .
simon , what's up?
listen .
i need you to get me into that nanotech ipo .
i want 10 blocks .
that's $50, 000 !
did you inherit a boatload or something?
the initial public offering comes out on tuesday .
what do you expect me to do?
i know when it comes out .
i set the damn date , okay?
just buy it for me on margin .
dude , you don't work here anymore .
i need this ipo to hold me over until i get another job .
i know you're really screwed right now ... but do you even have $50, 000?
i'm gonna sell off my iras , okay?
i'll have it in 10 days .
i can't do margin .
i need cash .
i'm in jersey right now .
where am i gonna get cash?
i'm sure one of those chemical plants has an atm machine .
all right , look .
i'll get the cash .
just put in the order .
cash by tuesday .
i'll bring it to you personally on monday .
don't punk out on me .
hey .
hey .
what are you doing here?
i feel like we didn't get off on the right foot yesterday ... so i thought maybe ...
i'd come here and take you to lunch .
maybe we could bond a little .
i think we bonded just fine around 3 : 10 this morning when your knee was in my crotch .
right .
i'll buy .
you want to buy me lunch?
yeah .
i figured it's the proper thing to do after sleeping with each other .
okay .
so , nice bank .
i'm glad you like it .
i like the small town feel .
it's less complicated .
percy , i need a loan .
right?
and then , of course , you say , " well , yeah .
how much?
they say , " i don't know .
you tell me . $50, 000?
what , you need $50, 000?
do i need $50, 000?
yeah .
no .
i most assuredly do not .
i was just admiring the process .
how many cylinders does a nascar engine have , six or eight?
how ...
yeah .
six ... or eight ... depending on the gas mileage consumption of the automobile .
you never worked in the pit at nascar .
you might as well admit it .
all right , you know , fine .
i never really had an aptitude for engines .
jay ...
jeff ...
jeff gordon didn't really trust me in the pit that much .
but you did drive the cars .
drive?
yeah .
absolutely .
good .
all right !
fine !
i never drove nascar !
but i was nervous and i wanted to impress you .
you shouldn't have lied .
all right .
this is the deal .
we go one lap around .
if you beat me , i'll loan you the money .
really?
i knew it !
i knew you needed the money .
i don't need the money !
move over !
yeah .
fool !
sucker !
move it , man !
what the hell are you doing?
i think it's obvious who came in first .
you're doggone right .
you know i won .
i was through the bushes before ...
i was through first .
i had more speed .
i was through the bushes and on the asphalt ...
before you even were at the bushes .
look .
dispatch , this is 53 charlie .
brian , we got a problem .
two cars have jumped ...
license and registration .
poppy !
there's my beautiful girl .
simon , i want you to meet my granddad .
hi , there .
howard jones .
simon green .
good to meet you , sir .
nice to meet you .
hey , speed racer .
hey !
what's with the white kid?
that's simon .
he's my boyfriend .
your boyfriend?
you didn't tell me he was white .
yes , i did .
when?
back at the home .
i thought you was kidding .
okay .
well , i think that's it .
i think you're forgetting about the vodka .
say grace , percy .
thank you , lord .
amen .
that was fast .
the lord knows i'm busy .
simon , pass on the broccoli , please .
yes , sir .
so , what , they don't have any available young black men in new york anymore?
they just ran out last week , grandpa .
i'm just trying to figure out why you chose to go this way .
don't mind him .
it's okay .
my grandmother loved you when she first met you .
but later she said some things .
i was like , " wow , grandma .
what kind of things?
yeah , what kind of things?
nothing .
just things .
such as?
yeah , such as?
daddy?
i got it .
i know .
you know what?
you're gonna laugh when you hear this .
she said that theresa was a very pretty girl .
that's so nice .
good taste .
so i ask her what she liked about you the most , right?
she said ...
she says , " i just love her cute , little , nappy little head .
your grandmother , where does she live?
brooklyn .
why?
i just wanna know how far i'd have to travel to kick her old white ass , that's why !
grandpa .
you don't call my grandchild no nappy head !
did she say that while putting on a sheet for the klan rally?
settle down , now !
hand me the butter .
my grandmother's not a malicious woman .
no , she's not .
she's 82 .
she comes from a different time .
i'm 74 and i come from a different time .
you don't hear me calling white folks honky and flat ass !
casper .
cracker .
ofay .
peckerwood .
wonder bread .
bird shit .
bird shit?
it's almost white .
that's pretty good .
howard .
percy !
it's okay .
i'm really sorry about what my grandmother said ... but there are some people you're just never gonna change ...
as much as you'd like to .
yep .
i can tell you this .
last thanksgiving ... my uncle dave said a black joke at the table , right?
so i said , right in front of the whole family , " look , that's inappropriate .
we're not gonna have it .
i think that's how you change people .
you just gotta attack it one at a time .
exactly .
what was the joke?
excuse me?
tell the joke .
i don't remember it .
sure you do .
tell the joke .
really , i don't remember it .
it was ...
dad .
chicken .
excuse me?
i didn't stutter .
okay , you know what?
i'll tell the joke .
no , simon .
you don't ...
baby , it's okay .
i'll tell you why .
because by not telling the joke , i'm empowering it .
right?
so i'll just ... tell the joke and expose how simple minded ... and crude and unfunny it actually is .
what do you call ...
what do you call 100 black men ... buried in the ground up to their neck?
what?
afro turf .
that's cute .
what are you laughing at?
it's cute .
cute don't make it funny .
tell another .
dad , no .
let the man tell a joke !
i don't know any other ones .
obviously , i've heard other black jokes , but i think i've proven my point .
so it's okay to empower the other ones?
okay .
i see what you're doing here , you're putting me on the spot .
it's okay .
look , it's fine .
'cause i'm not gonna back down .
back down , simon .
the only way to break down barriers is to have everything out in the open .
right?
exactly .
so , what do you call ... one black man being chased by 300 white men?
what?
the pga tour .
i get it .
tiger woods .
there it is .
that's good .
tell another one .
how do we know that adam and eve weren't black?
how?
you ever try to take a rib away from a black man?
that's pretty good .
that's pretty good .
i wouldn't take one from you , i know that !
you chewing it down to the bone .
that's a good one .
he's a rib fan .
don't try .
tell more .
okay .
why don't black people like country music?
why?
'cause every time they say " hoe down , " they think someone shot their sister .
you gonna be all right?
that is so true .
that's a tailored joke for you .
why i gotta be a ho?
ain't nobody talking about you .
it's a sister joke !
you're sisters .
i'm not the " ho sister .
come on now .
can't stop now , baby .
what are three things that a black man can't get?
what is that he can't he get?
a black eye , a fat lip , and a job .
i tell you i'm going to kick this boy's ass !
grandpa .
no , it's ...
we know you can take him , but just sit down .
be nice .
come on .
come on , now .
it's a joke .
that's right , daddy .
sit down .
it's just a joke .
come on .
hee hee , ha ha .
that's all it is .
now if you'll excuse me ... all of a sudden , i lost my appetite .
think i'll take a walk .
i should have stopped at " hoe down . " you should have never started .
this isn't like us at home , laughing about this bullshit .
it's my father's house , simon .
what do you want me to do , go upstairs and apologize to him again?
no .
let the storm pass .
it'll be fine .
besides , he dared you !
he double dared !
he called me chicken .
i heard !
i can't be called chicken .
you have to watch him on those .
you know?
i'm fresh out of ideas as to how to impress your father .
telling black jokes is never a good idea , but that's just me .
you think?
i'll talk to him .
say nice things about me .
no , i'm not going to say nice things about you .
you are still punished .
baby , i'm a good guy .
i like ribs , too .
i don't ...
why are you being so mean to me?
my grandfather's out there .
he's not going to come in .
this is my mom's kitchen !
she's not going to come in .
you're still gonna do the dishes .
get off me .
fine , i'll do the dishes .
here , do the broccoli one .
dad , i have to talk to you .
what?
why did you do that?
i didn't start it .
mr. nappy head did .
dad , simon's a good man .
he has a good heart .
a good man?
you put him on the spot .
you really think so?
what is your problem with him anyways?
besides the fact , of course , that he's white .
you gonna get in a heap of trouble talking to me like that .
don't care nothing about that man being white .
he's hiding something .
what?
nascar?
you thought i didn't know?
of course i knew .
we talk about everything , simon and i.
daddy , i love him , and you need to start respecting that .
then you respect me enough to tell me in advance who you're bringing home .
i didn't think you'd care .
but you weren't sure .
so you decided to test me .
no , of course not .
so you're looking for a reaction?
no .
so what are you looking for?
i'm looking for you to tell me that it's okay for me to be with him .
i'm scared .
okay?
i'm really scared , dad .
i know things are different now and times have changed ... but you should really hear the kind of things that people say to us sometimes .
and the way they look at us .
i need you to tell me that it's okay to be with him .
baby , me telling you it's okay is not gonna change the world .
dad .
but it would change my world .
it will change my world if i know that you're behind us .
i'm always behind you , sweetheart .
and i love you .
it's my job to keep you safe .
and i don't trust that kid .
hey , baby .
yes .
i'm trying to figure out where he got all those doggone black jokes .
what do white people do , take a class ... sit around and think of new jokes about the black man?
i don't know , percy .
you need to let that one go .
come on , sweetheart .
we need to practice the tango .
i told you .
i ain't doing no doggone tango .
why?
you think you can't dance anymore?
no .
i think the tango's a stupid dance and i ain't doing it .
marilyn ... why can't we do the hustle?
what's wrong with the hustle?
because the hustle is a stupid dance ... and i want to do the tango .
look here , woman , can't we do this some other time?
i gotta take dad back to the home .
i'll be back .
okay .
shut up !
all right , stop .
okay , move a little to your left .
okay .
all right , kiss me .
this is the exact spot where i had my first kiss .
no !
i'm not going to kiss you in the spot that you had your first kiss .
no .
why not?
it's some other guy's spot .
fine .
what was his name?
curtis booker .
he had these big old bucky beaver teeth .
but he was such a nice boy .
he was a good kisser , too .
better than me?
way better .
way better?
yeah .
did he grab your ass?
no .
squeeze it?
no .
we were 13 .
grab you down here?
no .
come on !
slow down .
come on .
there's a car !
get out of the way !
come on !
yeah !
okay , be careful .
so , this is my favorite spot .
it's pretty amazing , huh?
all right , so it's not ... the top of the world , but it's nice .
it's a fort .
it's a gun placement .
when i was little , i would sneak out of the house in the middle of the night ... and just come out here and just dream .
yeah?
weren't you afraid of sneaking out of your house?
please .
i'm not afraid of percy jones .
well , that makes you and ... you .
okay , so this is just cranford .
but it's a great place to grow up .
it's a good place to raise a family , too .
you know , maybe we shouldn't do this .
what?
live in the suburbs?
no .
tell your parents about our engagement this weekend .
simon , i told you not to look at him straight in the eye .
i don't think percy jones is ready .
i think percy jones needs more time .
a lot more time for percy jones .
are you getting cold feet , simon?
no .
no , i'm not getting cold feet .
i can't wait to marry you .
make babies with you .
give me a daughter that looks just like you .
i can work on that .
yeah?
yeah .
and hopefully , i can be a good dad .
i think you'll be a great dad .
you're never gonna be like your father , simon .
maybe i can be like yours .
like percy?
yeah .
no .
baby , percy jones is a good dad .
he's there for you .
he cares about you .
he loves you so much .
he does .
we just have to get him to love you .
maybe we can start by getting him to take the padlock off the basement door .
it's not going to happen .
why don't you give me a little curtis booker?
i can't believe i told you that .
come on , baby , a little bucky beaver?
no .
no .
how about some simon green?
marilyn , you cut off the porch light?
that's my girl .
very stylish .
i need to take a quarter inch off the pants .
i can do it here .
let me have them .
what , you mean take the pants off?
i could do with you in them but i don't want to poke you with my needle .
you keep your eyes on the pants , you hear me?
mr. jones , do you know where the extra chairs are?
what are you , blind?
they're against the wall .
when you go out , close the door .
right .
percy , put some pants on .
we got people in the house .
thank you .
thank you , sweetheart .
i didn't realize .
how long's it gonna take?
two shakes of a lamb's tail .
whatever the hell that means .
mercy , percy !
keep your shirt on !
or take it off .
whatever .
could someone answer that damn phone?
thank you !
jones residence .
this is reggie .
who's this?
this is theresa's boyfriend .
jamal !
what's up , man?
percy told me all about you .
what's that?
my name is reggie .
percy told me all about you , man .
he did?
you know what we should do?
get together and play some hoops , man .
i don't really play hoops .
come on , man .
don't be shy .
why are you being shy?
percy told me that you went to howard .
he said you almost went pro .
he said that?
yeah .
he was bragging all about you , jamal .
but listen ... two things .
could you autograph the issue ... of jet for me?
and the other thing is , i would love to meet the cosbys .
when i say love to meet them , i mean i love to meet them .
i'll see what i can do .
i feel like i grew up with them .
let me get percy for you .
you know , in the '80s and whatnot and ...
it's for you .
it's reggie .
we were talking about the cosbys .
may i have some privacy , please?
but , yeah , you know what i mean?
and shut the door .
i'd still love to meet them .
theo ...
reggie .
what did you find out?
you were right about simon green .
he is no longer at j. p. oliver .
come on .
give me my pants .
jamal , huh?
don't start .
this isn't about me .
it's about you and your job , that you don't have anymore .
what?
yeah .
move out of my way .
hey , baby !
theresa !
come here , sweetheart .
daddy needs to talk to you .
don't listen to him .
what are you talking about?
your boyfriend's unemployed , lost his job .
he got fired a couple days ago .
i did not get fired !
i quit !
you quit?
why didn't you tell me this?
it's complicated .
it's complicated when you're a liar .
i'm a liar?
what about the lies you told reggie?
jamal?
who's jamal?
he's good friends with the cosbys .
what about nascar?
that was nothing , and i admitted it .
you admitted that you lied .
you tried to kill me with a go kart .
at least i can drive .
this crazy ass almost got us arrested .
now we both got court dates .
i can't believe you checked up on me .
you kept asking me for money .
i never asked you for money .
you asked my father for money? $50, 000 loan , baby .
i did not .
he trapped me into it .
you're a liar .
you were checking up on him?
he forced my hand .
you're my daughter and he's not worthy !
that's not for you to decide .
right !
and what about you , lying to me?
you said you would never lie .
you ain't gotta go over there .
i thought i could get another job .
i was gonna tell you , but i didn't want to ruin the big weekend .
you said we would always tell each other the truth .
like how you told your parents about me being white?
i knew they wouldn't care about that .
i don't care .
i care that you're a liar .
that's bullshit !
you care .
he has to care .
it's human nature .
that means that you care that i'm black?
do you?
dad !
no .
it doesn't matter what i say .
you people are gonna think i'm a racist .
you hear that?
you people . " i know .
i heard .
what people?
the people in the yard .
that's what i'm ...
see?
i say one thing and i'm a racist !
no , simon , you're a liar .
and a racist .
where do you get off calling me a racist?
i have a black girlfriend !
you had a black girlfriend !
have .
past tense !
had !
and let me tell you something else , son ...
what the hell is going on?
i'll tell you what's going on .
he got fired from j. p. oliver !
i did not get fired !
i quit !
i told you to stay out of theresa's life .
thank you .
he can't just walk in our house , telling our baby lies .
i'm not lying !
i don't think so !
the party's off , percy .
woman , you must be crazy .
i don't want to say my vows with you .
it would be a lie before god .
marilyn , we're saying some goddamn vows tomorrow .
yeah , he got a book and everything .
would you shut up?
you got your vows out of a book?
no .
don't listen to him !
i got a book .
i'm using it for inspiration .
he wrote it down word for word .
you're going to get hurt .
that is so pathetic !
come on , marilyn !
because if memory serves me correctly , i used to be inspiration enough .
you still are !
you'd be inspiration to me .
he neglects you .
marilyn , get your ass back here !
i got a $200 cake coming tomorrow !
sixty pounds of shrimp !
sixty pounds of shrimp , woman !
i had to take a second on the house !
she looked angry .
marilyn , don't let me raise my voice now !
you gonna force me to use the muscle !
hope you like seafood .
theresa !
wait !
come on !
they'll be back .
no , they're not coming back .
they gotta come back .
sixty pounds of shrimp !
come on , baby .
pick it up .
answer that phone , sweetheart , and it will be your last .
let me borrow your car .
what?
you can't go chasing behind no women .
have some dignity !
besides , you can't even drive a damn go kart !
trouble in paradise?
baby , we need to talk about this .
you should call me and we should talk about it like adults ... because adults communicate when they have problems .
i'm looking at your photos on the wall and they're beautiful .
beautiful photos .
i don't think that i compliment you on your work enough .
you know what?
you're being rude .
that's what you're being .
so call me back .
baby , i'm sorry .
you're not being rude .
you have all the reason in the world to be upset with me right now .
you shouldn't be calling me back .
if i was you , i wouldn't call me back .
baby , call me back .
call me back , baby .
i'm looking at your bulletin board and there's a picture of you ... sitting next to a guy and i think that that guy might be curtis booker .
he looks like he's got bucky beaver teeth .
he looks a lot older than 13 !
so i don't know how you feel about it , but it's gone !
old curtis booker can go bye bye !
baby , do you have any scotch tape?
you're acting like i cheated on you , and i've never cheated on you ... except for that one time with myself , and you caught me .
hello .
darlene !
how you doing?
this is percy jones .
i'm looking for marilyn .
she left a little earlier .
i thought she'd be back by now .
i'm sorry .
now , who is this?
percy jones .
i'm sorry , percy .
i must have fell asleep on the couch .
baby , you say you looking for marilyn?
have you seen her?
well , now , what happened?
what'd you say to my sister , percy jones?
nothing .
listen , if you hear from her , can you let me know?
will do .
and i look forward to seeing you tomorrow at the party , right?
yeah , it should be a lot of fun .
goodbye .
girl !
you will never guess who was just on the phone !
who?
a mr. percy a. jones .
percy a. who?
yeah , well , baby , he is feeling the pain now !
mom .
is that gonna be your last one?
it might be , baby .
and it might not .
you should be over there trying to work this out with dad .
i should be over there trying to work it out with simon .
mom , please .
child , leave your mom alone .
they ain't going nowhere .
your man quit his job and didn't tell you .
got to nip that shit in the bud .
yes .
no .
but ...
look , i have 15 missed calls .
fifteen , mom .
fifteen !
fifteen?
your baby got 15 missed calls !
bullshit .
let him wait !
that's true .
i'm gonna call him now .

did he lie to you , theresa?
did he lie to you?
yes , he did .
so , if you don't want him to do it again , let him feel the pain !
look , honey , and if you want him that bad , you've got to train him .

marilyn's got good taste in vodka .
this is , like , a $50 bottle .
give me that .
give it here .
can i at least have a little bit?
no .
just a taste .
come around here and get those two glasses over there .
hurry up .
who's playing?

that's history .
new york giants 'first super bowl win .

i told you before , no .
pitiful .
all right , let's do it .
do what?
fumble !
you said you weren't gonna hit me !
touchdown !
yeah , baby .
this is where your hands go .
where am i gonna be?
you're on the bottom .

double time .
okay , no .
see?
this is ...
what was wrong with that?
you're screwing around .
i'm not .
you're getting crazy here , not holding your frame .
there must be space between us .
not like when we're sleeping .
you can't be , like , up here .
you're not holding your frame .
it's a structured dance .
okay , so back up .
your mama taught you this?
yes , i used to help her in the dance studio on the weekends .
step .
two .
you get fired from there , too?
no .
i didn't get fired from this job .
i quit .
was it over money?
because if it wasn't , this doesn't make any sense .
i had a difference of opinion with the management .
they weren't ready for a guy like me .
i don't get it .
and heads .
no , you're doing great .
i ain't talking about this .
i'm talking about you and theresa .
you ain't got nothing in common .
you don't like sports .
theresa loves sports .
you're a businessman .
she's an artist .
you're white .
she's black .
did i miss anything?
no .
that's just it .
she's everything i'm not .
you know , she's my other half .
without her , i'm not whole .
you know , the thing about meeting your other half is ... you're walking around , you think you're happy ... you think that you're whole .
then you realize you ain't shit without her .
then you can't go back to being a half ...
'cause now you know what it's like to be a whole .
you know what i mean?
yeah , i do .
and i still got it .
that was nice .
real nice .
i liked the snap .
you like that?
i think you hurt me .
percy jones , boy .
good morning .
looks like i missed a fun night .
just sitting up here , watching football .
that's how it always starts .
where's marilyn?
she stayed all night at darlene's house .
she must be really mad .
wait .
you knew where they were the whole time?
yeah .
i thought they'd be back by now .
did you apologize?
i didn't do anything .
exactly !
dante , please .
don't try to play that metrosexual mind game on me , okay?
okay .
all right .
let's go get them .
you don't understand .
they done called all their friends and sat up all night ragging on men .
they've worked themselves up into a man hating frenzy .
how many women?
i guarantee you , large numbers .
sisters .
you can't just walk in on a bunch of angry black women .
you'll die .
well , we'll just have to go out like men .
he's right , percy .
i know he's right .
but i'm still scared .
keep talking .
what are you saying?
like that , a little .
i'm liking it .
thank you .
you gonna share your colors?
you're one of them sisters who don't share colors .
no , i'm not .
give up your secrets , honey .
this is gorgeous .
pink passion .
every woman needs this .
a little pink passion?
you know what i always say?
a little bit of makeup , a little bit of hair ain't never hurt nobody .
how did i know she would be wearing pink passion?
yes , they're in there .
maybe i should go first .
are you crazy?
i'm the one that got experience in this sort of thing .
you just pay attention .
i'll show you how it's done .
here , straighten yourself up .
if you go up in there , you go in looking like a man .
wipe this off .
you got something .
thank you .
yeah .
man , i'm not gonna ...
no .
we gotta do this .
well , well , well .
if it isn't mr. percy jones .
it is i.
it's about time you showed up .
what's up?
i'm well .
percy .
marilyn .
marilyn , may i speak to you in private over there , please ... so the ladies can continue eating?
oh , no !
you go on home with that .
it's not going down like that , my brother .
no way , no how .
you know better than that , percy .
you got something to say , say it here .
in front of everybody .
step up to the chalk line and be a man .
i married you , didn't i?
don't that count for something?
hell , no !
what does he want , an award?
that don't count for nothing !
it really doesn't count .
come on , man .
i know , i'm just ...
oh , hell .
i was wrong , okay?
it's a good start , percy .
keep going !
i've been wrong for a long time .
ever since i forgot ... that you are my better half .
hell , marilyn , you're everything i'm not .
without you , i'm not whole .
look .
let ...
baby , before i met you , i thought i was all that .
and then you came into my life , and i realized that i wasn't all that .
wasn't even half of that .
i might have been a quarter of that .
but then you left me last night !
and , baby , i remembered how it felt to be without you .
and let me tell you something .
i ain't shit without you !
dad .
man .
and i forgot about that .
and i'm sorry .
baby , marry me .
make me whole again .
i love you , percy .
i love you , too .
that's what i'm talking about , baby .
you go , marilyn , bad girl !
kiss your baby .
i missed you so much .
i missed you .
i couldn't sleep at all last night .
i'm sorry , baby .
i feel so much better !
isn't that lovely?
get off that .
i guess it's my turn .
all right .
that's going to be a tough speech to follow .
it was a great speech , perce .
thank you .
i had something similar in mind .
great minds think alike .
admitting you were wrong would be a great start .
yes , it would .
right .
go ahead , man .
baby , i was wrong !
what are you doing?
i want to see your sexy body go bump , bump , bump .
we have to talk in private .
i don't wanna hear it .
no .
mom?
just stay here and talk about it in front of everybody !
ladies , please .
take your man and go work out your business .
that's right .
go on .
thank you .
don't let him work on you .
that ain't right .
did he say " bump , bump , bump "?
yeah , and it's percy's fault .
it's all your fault !
those kids are in love and they finally liked each other and you all interfere .
my love right here .
don't tell me how to define my love !
lord have mercy .
baby .
come on .
i was trying to impress your father .
i didn't want to show up here and be the unemployed fianc .
i've never lied to you before and i'll never lie to you again , ever .
you lied about asking my father for a loan .
that was an omission that was tied to a previous lie .
that doesn't ...
and i look like an idiot to you .
no .
you look a little bit like percy jones , though .
i can't believe you're trying to be funny .
baby , come on .
why do you have to be funny right now?
don't touch me !
you need to calm down .
you made me look like an asshole in there .
don't tell me to calm down .
i think you were doing a pretty good job of that yourself .
not telling them about me?
and then i pitched in and i blew it , okay?
i panicked when i found out that nathan was blackballing me .
i thought if i could score this ipo , i'd have enough money until i got another job .
but i was doing that for you .
what am i , your mother?
i don't need you to take care of me .
i want you to do things with me , not for me , simon !
will you just talk to me?
i am talking to you .
you're talking at me .
i am talking to you .
but you need to talk to me and tell me how am i supposed to believe in you ... when you don't trust me enough to tell me the truth?
how do we get past this , with this skin , if we don't have each other's back?
okay , i'm always gonna be the white boy .
and i'll always be the black girl .
but at least i'm here and willing to deal with it , and i don't know about you .
i don't know .
and eventually , if you're gonna quit on me , just do it and don't ...
i'm standing right here !
what more do you want from me?
what do you want from the white boy?
i've been here busting my ass to make you happy !
then let me make this easy for you !
the engagement is off !
fine .
good .
great .
great .
i'm in jersey !
okay , stand still now .
i'm still .
you all right?
i'm fine .
i'm great .
it's going to be a great day , dad .
it sure is .
yes .
i'm gonna take lots of pictures .
so you better smile big for me , okay?
i will .
and no crying .
mom said you cried last time .
i was not crying , i was sweating ... from my eyeballs .
hell , i was nervous .
i knew i was making a big mistake .
a 25 year mistake .
and going for 25 more .
sweetheart?
why don't you call that man?
you know he got his cell phone on .
you know he does .
he's probably waiting on the 5 : 15 train .
we got a party going on .
you get his ass back here !
how many missed calls you have last night?
thirty three .
thirty three?
yeah .
thirty three?
yeah .
thirty three missed calls?
sweetheart , that's major .
and you know the man is unemployed , yes , but he calls you .
so give him that .
thirty three missed calls?
and you can't call him once?
girl , don't be so proud .
no .
daddy , it's not ...
pride ain't nothing when it comes to matters of the heart .
it's not that .
it's not?
no .
i was going to marry him .
what?
we were going to announce our engagement this weekend .
so , you see?
i have you to thank ... because you saved me from a big heartache .
sweetheart , i just don't understand something .
why did simon quit his job?
i don't know .
he didn't say .
why would a man quit his job on the day he's gonna meet his future father in law?
maybe he got tired of waiting for that promotion that never happened .
simon's a rising star , dad .
he really is .
i believe that .
but that boss of his is just not a nice man .
you ever met him?
a couple of times .
he was always friendly , kind of .
but he always had this look in his eyes , you know?
just not a nice man .
but he was simon's mentor , so ...
whatever .
let it go .
today is about you and mom .
now , first picture of the night .
let me get my ...
on my good side .
smile .
i don't want mom to see me like this .
i love you , dad .
i love you , too .
damn !
no .
do not do this to me , percy jones !
we have a schedule !
tick tock .
everything works .
timing .
i'll be right back .
timing !
i'll be right back .
in 10 minutes?
or so , okay?
how so?
i'm sorry .
percy , have you met my wife , diane?
i certainly have heard a lot about you , percy jones .
nice to meet you .
does marilyn know you're going awol?
of course .
she does not .
so you missed your train , huh?
there's another one at 6 : 00 .
you gonna be on it?
i should have been on that one .
what are you doing here?
i know why you quit your job .
don't marry that black girl .
those weren't exactly the words .
how did you know we were getting married?
i told you , son .
don't nothing get past percy jones .
theresa told you .
that , too .
come on , man .
let's get real .
what you did with your boss was honorable , impressive ... and stupid .
you can't quit your job every time somebody rolls their eyes at the two of you .
you'll never make any money .
how do you do 25 years?
painfully .
no , seriously .
if you're gonna marry one of these women , sometimes it's gonna hurt like hell .
all you can do is admit that you're wrong and know that she's always right .
she's right?
that's right .
always?
right .
right .
that's right .
all right .
okay , what about all the talk about my dignity?
do you love her?
do you want her?
then she's always right .
look , i know i didn't give you a fair shake .
and i was wrong .
and my daughter , she'd be lucky to have you .
i'm not a quitter , mr. jones .
i think i know that about you .
theresa doesn't .
you just have to show her what you're made of .
you know she's hot headed .
she's just like her mama .
every man gets to choose his destiny , son .
no matter what his father did .
and , percy , you are not perfect .
but that works for me because two perfect people in one relationship ... might be too much .
and sometimes you bark and bluff and bluster ... but i always see the boy i married 25 years ago .
and i only wish i loved him as much as i did back then , but i don't .
i love him more .
thank you , marilyn .
that was lovely .
percy?
your vows?
marilyn jones .
everyone knows i didn't write my vows .
everyone knows because you kept beating me up about it for weeks ... crying to all your friends .
you know?
now , look here , woman .
i love you .
but you didn't have to do me like that about my vows .
you know i don't like writing .
she knows that .
i'm not a wordsmith .
i do numbers .
that's me .
i don't do words .
damn it , i do money .
and after 25 years , all i've asked you ... is to let me be me .
you'll never find
as long as you shall live
oh , lord .
someone to love you
love you , love you
tender like i do
you know that about me , woman .
you'll never find
no matter where you search
i'm not looking .
someone to care about you
care about you , care about you
the way i do
oh , i'm not bragging on myself , baby
but i'm the only one that loves you
i think i forgot what love is until you and simon showed up .
give that man another chance , daughter .
you'll never find
simon !
yes , simon .
it'll take the end of all time
someone who understands you
like i do
that's not jamal .
i could probably find a million reasons why we shouldn't be together .
but you know what?
i don't care .
i don't care , either .
i love you .
and i'm sorry that i lied to you .
i'm sorry , too .
you're sorry?
can you say that again?
i'm sorry , simon .
you're sorry?
she said she was sorry .
i believe she's ...
i'm sorry , simon .
get your man , girl !
go ahead , sweetie !
ladies and gentlemen , it gives me great pleasure ... to introduce to you all my future son in law , simon green .
he's broke , unemployed , and he's white .
but he loves my theresa and that's all right with us .
that's right .
welcome to the family , son .
welcome to the family .
and cue the magic .
look at this .
will you look at that shit?
drink up !
enjoy !
welcome , man .
let's watch the tango .
no , let's watch the party .
all right .
get your feet off the table .
sorry , sir .
i look pretty good out there .
you do , mom .
baby , you look so good because you're twirling around me .
oh , yeah , there you go , there you go .
all right , you blew that part .
that was perfect .
there was hesitation there .
you did it better the night before .
the night before?
what happened?
we had a little dry run the night before .
really?
you didn't tell me that , percy !
you're hallucinating , simon .
i ain't never danced with no man in my life .
taught him everything he knows .
percy jones was born knowing how to tango .
and let me tell you something about the tango .
it's a structured dance .
i told you that .
what was that , mom?
you know what that is , theresa .
you're a grown ass woman .
damn , mama , you still got it .
i know it , keisha .
all right now , watch this .
this is when i got funky .
go , percy !
it's your birthday !
go , percy .
let's watch the vows .
no !
watch the party .
okay , fine , whatever .
there you are .
i got her , that girl is mine !
i was just shocked you didn't fall down .
that is cold .
look .
check me out .
i am doing the hustle .
i'm doing the hustle in your honor , percy jones .
that ain't no damn hustle .
that's the white man overbite .
you ain't even doing that right .
why's it gotta be a white thing?
blacks have overbites , too .
he's doing a great hustle !
he's turning it up .
why is my man looking at your ass?
no , he's not .
why is your man samoan?
where is manu these days?
we broke up last week .
thank you , jesus .
what happened?
i only started going out with him to mess with daddy .
and , girl , please .
he is too big .
he is a bone crusher .
watch your mouth !
what?
do not use the word " bone " in my house .
where were you all going?
let's see that again .
your mother and i got a sudden thirst for punch .
no .
you're old enough to know .
we going to shake some sheets .
is that all right with you?
i thought you said no bone in the house !
no !
if everyone wants to see the lift , we do the lift .
we're doing the lift !
this is good .
no .
i was so sure you were going to drop me there .
i love you !
this is dirty dancing .
i've been doing this since high school .
look at that .
who's the man?
you did it with other girls?
no , i only do that with you .
i know that hurt .
see that move right there .
that's why you're not getting any grandkids .
let me call your mama right now and thank her for those dance lessons .
that's a low blow .
it's just a joke .
simon !
come on .
i'll catch your big ass .
we're down !
good thing is , she didn't break that dress .
no , she didn't , but she felt bad about it all week .
they gotta go deep .
i knew better .
oh , my god .
that was a great party .
it was , mom .
yeah , i guess a party not a party till something get broke .
