i promised my wife a trip .
put in a word for me , will you?
i'll speak to personnel .
but the next lunch is on you .
i will .
thanks , ming !
it's ready !
no , it'll switch itself off !
i told you , it's not ready !
a rice cooker !
it's yours , mrs koo?
no , it's beyond us !
it's mrs chan's .
my husband brought it from japan .
i wanted to show mrs koo how good it is .
now it's ready !
mrs chan ...
could mr chan get me one next time?
no problem !
mr chow , you should get one too !
your wife's so often late home .
i couldn't trouble mr chan .
it's just neighborly , isn't it?
it's no trouble !
i'll ask him to buy another next time .
thank you !
let's try the rice .
mr chan , sorry to trouble you about the rice cooker .
it was really no trouble .
how much do i owe you?
your wife has already paid me .
really?
she didn't tell you?
she's been working late shifts .
often i'm asleep when she gets back .
it must be hard for her .
yes .
mrs chan isn't back yet?
she'll be back soon ...
you need to talk to her?
a friend needs to go to singapore .
i wonder if she could get a cheap ticket for him .
i'll ask when she gets back .
i'm bothering you too much .
don't mention it , we're neighbors !
i'll leave you in peace .
looking for me?
damn right , where've you been?
what's up?
mrs chan called , you left a hat at her office .
i meant to !
i wanted an excuse to go back .
i know your tricks !
she's married .
i know , that's why i left .
otherwise i'd move in next door .
if your wife wasn't so attractive , she'd be a worried woman !
i'm not like you .
please call mrs chan for me .
i'll pick up the hat tomorrow .
and take her to lunch !
dream on !
she'll take the hat home .
i'll bring it in tomorrow .
you're kidding !
some buddy you are !
tell you what , let's go pick her up now !
she should be off work by now .
we can go together !
i don't have time for this .
chow !
yes !
get out of here , i'm busy .
then i'll wait at your place .
ping !
mr chow , is mr koo in?
he's out ...
forgot to buy the paper again?
that's right , i'll stop by later .
maybe i can find it for you .
thank you .
this one?
yes .
i always loved those serials , hated to miss an episode .
really?
you liked them too?
i even thought of writing one !
why didn't you?
i couldn't get started , so i gave up .
i wasn't born to write martial arts stories !
but you can borrow from my collection anytime .
not now , maybe another time .
thanks .
you're welcome !
what is it?
mrs chan !
i just want to return these to mr chow .
is he in?
he's been away for a few days .
why?
they had a quarrel .
leave them with me , i'll pass them back to him .
thank you .
forget it !
i'm on a replacement shift tonight .
talk to you later .
no need to pick me up !
she's already left .
really?
i was going to take her out for supper .
didn't she tell you she was off early today?
she never remembers to tell me .
maybe she's home by now .
i'll be off , then .
okay , bye !
hello !
you're out of hospital !
don't mention hospital !
lend me $30 !
what for?
you gotta help me save face !
what's the big deal?
it's ah hoi's fault .
he gave me a racing tip , said it was a sure thing .
before they'd taken out the stitches ...
i bet everything i had .
and i lost my shirt !
what did you expect?
i thought it was my lucky day .
anyhow , i had only $2 left .
so i went to the whorehouse .
you were in no shape for sex !
i thought it would improve my luck .
what would $2 buy you?
i'm kwai fei's regular , she gives me credit .
you can have it on credit?
i left my id card and said i'd be back to redeem it .
i thought a few dollars would be easy to rustle up .
but so far nothing i'm way overdue .
so?
four eyes was there yesterday .
saw her waving my id around in front of everyone .
so embarrassing !
anyway , lend me $30 !
this is all i can spare .
i need $1 0 for myself .
pay you back next month .
let's have a late snack .
what?
all i've had today is some won ton noodles .
let me finish writing this first .
i'm not sure i should tell you this ...
what?
i saw your wife in the street yesterday .
so what?
she was with some guy .
probably a friend .
just thought you should know .
miss yu?
this is me .
mr ho's still in a meeting .
he says he can't manage dinner .
yes , we're very busy now .
i will .
i'll ask mr ho to call .
have you called miss yu?
yes , i have .
what did she say?
asks you to call her later .
and mrs ho says she's ready to cut her birthday cake .
she wants you to hurry home .
did you get me a present for her?
yes , this .
what is it?
a scarf .
i think mrs ho will like it .
thank you .
and here's your change .
i'm always troubling you , use it for bus fare .
why don't you dine with us tonight?
thank you , i've already planned to see a film tonight .
then i won't keep you .
tomorrow will be quiet , take the morning off .
are you going out tonight?
don't forget your keys .
all the neighbors are dining out tonight .
i have a lot to do here , i'll be late .
what is it , mrs chan?
i heard voices ,
i thought mr and mrs koo were back .
not yet , anything i can help with?
no , i just wanted a chat .
are you alone?
yes , i am .
you're back early today !
i came back to rest .
i'm not feeling well ...
what is it?
i have some medicines ...
don't trouble yourself , i'll sleep it off .
in that case , i'll leave you in peace .
it was your wife .
have you spoken to your wife yet?
then we shouldn't meet any more .
any news from the philippines?
yes , a telex .
there's a typhoon , so the ship's still docked .
please inform chan that the shipment may be delayed .
ask if that's a problem .
your wife rang .
you don't need to pick her up .
she's playing mahjong with mrs lau .
she'll meet you at the restaurant at 5 . 30 .
and there's a gift from miss yu .
she was here?
no , she had it sent over .
she says she'll dine alone since it's your birthday .
please phone her when you have a moment .
i'll get you another coffee .
thank you .
thank you .
that tie looks good on you .
you noticed?
it's much like the old one .
you notice things if you pay attention .
i'll be off now .
if chan has a problem , let me know at the restaurant .
i will .
why did you change your tie?
the new one was too showy .
i should stick with my own .
don't forget to lock up .
by the way , haven't seen your husband lately .
he's abroad now , on company business .
that's why i see you at the noodle stall .
i don't like cooking for myself .
haven't seen your wife lately either .
her mother's ill , she's at home with her .
that explains it .
good night !
good night !
mrs chan , i'm glad you're back !
it's raining so hard !
i was going to look for you with an umbrella .
you're too kind .
amah , who is it?
it's mrs chan .
mrs suen !
caught in the rain?
i said you could eat with us !
next time ...
enjoy your game .
her husband's always away .
it's sad to see her so lonely .
she dresses up like that to go out for noodles?
mr chow !
what are you doing here?
just calling mrs koo to the phone .
you're late back .
i went to the pictures .
i'll be going .
hello?
yes , please hold on .
who is it?
it's for mrs chan .
it must seem odd to ask you out , but i want to ask something .
that handbag i saw you with this evening ...
where did you buy it?
why do you ask?
it looked so elegant .
i want to get one for my wife .
mr chow , you're so good to your wife !
not really !
my wife is so fussy .
her birthday is some days away .
i don't know what to get her .
could you buy one for me to give her?
maybe she wouldn't want one just exactly the same .
you're right , i didn't think of that .
a woman would mind .
yes , especially since we're neighbors .
do they come in other colors?
i'd have to ask my husband .
why?
he bought it for me on a business trip abroad .
they aren't on sale here .
then never mind .
actually ...
i want to ask you something too .
what?
where did you buy your tie?
i don't know where it came from .
my wife buys all my ties .
really?
she bought this one on a business trip abroad .
it's not on sale here .
what a coincidence !
yes .
actually ...
my husband has one just like it .
he said it was a gift from his boss .
so he wears it every day .
and my wife has a bag just like yours .
i know ,
i've seen it .
what are you getting at , actually?
i thought i was the only one who knew .
i wonder how it began ...
it's late ... won't your wife complain?
she's used to it , she doesn't care .
and your husband?
he must be asleep by now .
shall we stay out tonight?
my husband would never say that .
what would he say?
anyhow , he wouldn't say that .
someone must have made the first move .
who else could it be?
it's late ... won't your wife complain?
she's used to it , she doesn't care .
and your husband?
he must be asleep by now .
i can't say it .
i understand .
after all , it's already happened .
it doesn't matter who made the first move .
do you really know your wife?
you order for me .
why?
i've no idea what your wife likes .
what about your husband?
like it hot?
your wife likes hot dishes .
why did you call me at the office today?
i had nothing to do .
i wanted to hear your voice .
you have my husband down pat .
he's a real sweet talker .
why didn't you call me today?
i was afraid you won't like it .
then don't call me again .
mrs chan !
a letter from your husband .
it's not for me , it's for mr chow next door .
the japanese stamp made me think it was your husband .
so i was wrong .
your wife's in japan?
how did you know?
what did she say in her letter?
nothing special .
anything about when she'd be back?
no .
what do you think they're doing right now?
are you alright?
i'm fine .
please pull up here !
why?
i'll get off first .
no , let me .
mrs chan !
ah ping !
you're back?
visiting mr chow?
yes , i thought we'd have lunch .
but he isn't well .
what's wrong with him?
he's got a fever .
he's all alone .
so i'm gonna buy him something to eat .
the congee downstairs is quite good .
he doesn't want congee .
what does he want?
can't taste anything , so he wants sesame syrup .
damned troublesome !
amah !
mrs suen , she's hanging the washing on the roof .
oh , you're back .
yes .
you've been out?
my mother's birthday is coming up .
so i took her to buy some fabric .
it took all day , i'm half dead !
and i had my hair done ...
is it nice?
very nice !
what are you cooking?
i had a sudden craving for sesame syrup .
that whole pot is for you?
i thought i might as well make a potful .
you're so thoughtful !
please try it .
i will .
what a coincidence !
going out?
i'll buy some noodles , i'm starving .
hungry?
will you join me?
no thanks .
just off work?
you must be very busy .
actually , i've been to see a picture .
really?
how was it?
so so .
i used to like going to the pictures .
you had many hobbies before .
on your own , you are free to do lots of things .
everything changes when you marry .
it must be decided together ...
right?
i sometimes wonder what i'd be if i hadn't married .
have you ever thought of that?
maybe happier !
i didn't know married life would be so complicated !
when you're single , you are only responsible to yourself .
once you're married , doing well on your own is not enough .
don't brood on it , maybe he'll be back soon .
what about you?
actually , we're in the same boat .
but i don't brood on it .
it's not my fault .
i can't waste time wondering if i made mistakes .
life's too short for that .
something must change .
so what's your plan?
i want to write a martial arts serial .
actually , i've started one .
i'll show it to you .
great !
you like them too , so why not help me write it?
i wouldn't know how , i only read them !
we could discuss it together .
alright , i'll try my best .
i never thanked you for the sesame syrup .
there's no need , i was making it anyway .
amazing !
i was craving for some sesame syrup that day .
really?
what a coincidence !
it really was !
i'll go for those noodles .
again !
halfway through dinner , he's drunk !
disgusting !
i told you to stop !
what can you do?
it's me !
you scared me .
how's mr koo?
drunk , as usual .
i didn't expect them back so early !
since you're trapped here , finish the noodles .
they'll probably go soon .
want some soup?
want some soup?
mrs suen !
playing here tonight !
yes , mrs koo is dealing with her husband .
i could do that .
no , we should not trouble you .
think you'll play all night?
no , we'll just play eight rounds .
they'll play till morning?
mrs suen says only eight rounds .
you believe that?
you get some rest , i'll wake you when they leave .
and you?
i have a chapter to finish .
where have you got to?
the drunken master just showed up .
when did he get written in?
just now !
mr chow , home so early?
i went out to buy some food .
no work today?
i don't feel so good , i'm staying home .
a sick man shouldn't eat all that sticky rice .
some of it is for later .
don't stuff yourself !
good morning !
good morning , finished your game?
no yet , but mr yang has to work .
mr tsai is coming to replace him .
did you call the office for me?
yes .
what did you tell them?
that you weren't feeling well .
did they ask who you were?
no .
probably took me for your husband .
mr ho knows that he's away .
pretend he's come back .
maybe we're being too cautious?
i'm always round anyway .
we shouldn't have panicked .
well , they did turn up without warning .
what would they assume?
one can't put a foot wrong .
you can go !
amah !
mrs chan !
you're back very late !
i had a lot of work today .
i didn't see you leave this morning .
i had breakfast with my mother .
you weren't here when i left .
where's mrs suen?
asleep , she played mahjong all day .
be quiet , don't wake her .
alright !
mrs chan , is your leg alright?
it's these new shoes .
why a special dinner tonight?
since you won't take your share of the writing fee ...
all i did was give you some thoughts .
someone else is asking for a serial too .
there'll be more work soon .
really?
so quickly?
isn't the workload too much?
that's why i'm looking for a new place .
what for?
to write in !
it'll be more convenient .
there's nothing between us , but i don't want gossip .
what do you think?
why waste money?
you don't need me , you can write on your own .
who do you want?
chow mo wan?
he hasn't been in for several days .
we're looking for him too .
may i know who's calling?
any message?
it's no trouble , goodbye .
please get this to accounts .
and have the air conditioner serviced tomorrow .
mr ho !
no need to stay if everything's done .
i'll lock up .
yes .
hello?
where are you?
i'll come again tomorrow .
no need , i'll be alright after some rest .
it's no trouble .
i'll bring you some food ...
what would you like?
whatever .
then i'll leave now .
get some rest .
call me when you get home .
let it ring three times , then hang up .
alright .
i didn't think you'd come .
we won't be like them .
see you tomorrow .
tell me honestly ...
do you have a mistress?
you're crazy !
who told you i had?
never mind who .
do you or don't you?
no .
don't lie !
look at me ...
i'm asking you , do you have a mistress?
yes !
that's no reaction !
if he admits it outright , let him have it !
i wasn't expecting he would admit it so easily .
i didn't know how to react !
one more time , alright?
tell me frankly ...
do you have a mistress?
you're crazy !
who told you that?
never mind that , do you or don't you?
no .
don't lie !
tell me !
look at me , do you have a mistress?
yes !
are you alright?
i didn't expect it to hurt so much .
this is just a rehearsal .
he won't really admit it so readily .
it's alright , don't take it so hard .
you've been out a lot lately .
yes .
it's right to enjoy yourself while you're young .
but don't overdo it .
when will your husband be back?
soon !
in future , don't let him travel so much .
a couple should spend time together .
don't you agree?
good night .
will you come over tonight?
what for?
the editor's hounding me , he says i'm too slow .
i need your help , when can you come?
not anytime soon .
why not?
mrs suen lectured me last night .
what did she say?
rather not say .
we shouldn't see so much of each other .
mrs chan , going out for noodles again?
not tonight , i'll make myself something .
join us , we're having vegetable won tons !
alright .
no lunch today , mr ho?
no .
a mr chow just called for you .
he wants you to call him back .
thank you .
back from work?
yes .
strange weather !
isn't it?
been here long?
just a while .
i don't think it'll stop soon .
wait for me .
i'll see you home .
we'd better not be seen together .
then you go first .
if they see your umbrella , they'll know i was with you .
i wasn't thinking .
you go first , i'll wait a while .
i'll keep you company .
did you try to call me?
i wasn't sure you got the message .
could you get me a boat ticket?
to where?
ah ping wrote from singapore .
they're short of staff , he'd like me to go and help .
how long will you stay?
don't know , i'll play it by ear .
why rush off to singapore?
a change of scene ...
i've had enough of the gossip .
we know it's not true , so why worry?
i used to think that too , and it didn't worry me .
i thought we wouldn't be like them .
but i was wrong .
you won't leave your husband .
so i'd rather go away .
i didn't think you'd fall in love with me .
i didn't either .
i was only curious to know how it started .
now i know .
feelings can creep up just like that .
i thought i was in control .
but i hate to think of your husband coming home .
i wish he'd stay away !
i'm so bad !
will you do me one favor?
what?
i want to be prepared ...
you'd better not see me again .
is your husband back?
yes ...
am i hopeless?
not really .
i won't see you again .
keep a closer eye on your husband .
please ...
don't be serious , it's only a rehearsal .
don't cry !
this isn't real ...
i don't want to go home tonight .
mei yi wants to dedicate a song to her honeymooning friends .
and mrs cheung wishes the best to her neighbors .
and mr chan , now in business in japan , wants to wish his wife a happy birthday .
so let's all enjoy zhou xuan singing in " full bloom " .
it's me .
if there's an extra ticket ... would you go with me?
it's me .
if there's an extra ticket ... would you go with me?
slngapore , 1963
mr chow has gone to work .
any message?
you're welcome !
has anyone been in my room?
no .
something's missing .
what?
in the old days , if someone had a secret they didn't want to share ...
you know what they did?
have no idea .
they went up a mountain , found a tree ...
carved a hole in it ...
and whispered the secret into the hole .
then they covered it with mud .
and leave the secret there forever .
what a pain !
i'd just go to get laid .
not everyone's like you !
i'm just an average guy , i don't have secrets like you .
you bottle things up !
tell me something !
i don't have secrets .
come off it , buddy !
i won't tell anyone .
hello , singapore daily .
hold on .
mr chow , call for you .
thanks !
hello?
hello?
hong kong , 1 966
who is it?
it's me .
mrs chan , long time no see !
yes .
amah , who's there?
mrs suen !
what brings you here?
it's been a while .
i was nearby so i thought i'd bring your boat ticket .
and a small gift .
you shouldn't have , it's nice just to see you .
the place is in such a mess !
already started packing?
it's hopeless , i can't bear to throw things away !
let's find you a seat .
have some tea !
thank you !
eat with us , mrs chan !
i'm going to the market .
i can't , i have work waiting .
don't rush off !
mrs suen will be upset if you don't eat here .
amah , pour me some tea too .
how's your husband?
he's fine , thank you .
how long will you be away?
i don't know .
if i like it , i might stay !
why?
my daughter worries about the situation in hong kong .
i don't want to leave .
since the koos left , i don't have my mahjong partners anymore .
and my daughter needs help with her kids in the us .
what about this place?
i'm not sure ...
i don't want to sell it .
so i might rent it out .
how much would you want?
you're interested?
you could have it at a discount .
i'll think about it .
mrs suen , your tea !
who lives next door now?
i don't really know them .
the koos were almost like family !
it was so nice then , wasn't it?
yes .
let's sit over here .
yes?
is mr koo in?
he moved long ago .
do you know where he is?
you know him well?
i used to live here .
is mrs suen still next door?
she's gone !
it's too chaotic , everyone's running away .
so who lives there now?
a woman and her son .
the kid is cute .
no address in the philippines ...
just his son's phone number .
i can't accept this !
please , you must .
thank you , then .
that era has passed .
nothing that belonged to it exists any more .
are you ready?
okay !
let's go !
cambodla , 1966
the presidential corps waits at pochentong airport ...
prince norodom sihanouk and queen sisowath kossamak come forward to greet general de gaulle .
it's ten kilometers from pochentong to phnom penh .
200, 000 people line the route .
a welcome unprecedented in the history of the kingdom .
he remembers those vanished years .
as though looking through a dusty window pane , the past is something he could see , but not touch .
and everything he sees is blurred and indistinct .
