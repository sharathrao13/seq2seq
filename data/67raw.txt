egg shen .
bus driver .
bus driver .
what kind of bus and where , please?
oh .
tour bus .
bus for tourists .
san francisco , chinatown .
before we get to the meat of this thing , doyou at the present time have any knowledge of the whereabouts of a mr. jack burton or his truck?
oh , god !
will you leave him alone?
mr. shen , please .
you could be in a great deal of trouble .
halfa city block explodes in a ball of green flame , and there are people who say you're involved , thatyou might be responsible , thatyou're a very dangerous man .
now , ifyou're protectingjack burton
you leave jack burton alone !
we are in his debt .
he showed great courage .
ok .
but ifl'm going to be your attorney , there are a few things that i have to know that still don't make any sense to me ...
iike , uh , you really believe in magic?
you mean chinese black magic?
yes .
oh , absolutely .
areyou still serious about this?
and , uh , monsters and ghosts as well , i suppose?
oh , sure .
and sorcery .
and i suppose thatyou expect me to believe in sorcery as well?
of course .
why?
because it's real .
how can i know that , mr. shen?
how?
yes .
how?
help me out here .
please .
how?
see?
that was nothing , but that's how it always begins , very small .
this isjack burton in the pork chop express , and i'm talking to whoever's listening out there .
like i told my last wife , i says ,
i never drive faster than i can see , besides , it's all in the reflexes .
youjust listen to the old pork chop express and take his advice on a dark and stormy night .
when some wild eyed , eight foot maniac taps your favorite head up against a barroom wall and asks you ifyou've paid your dues , rememberwhat oldjack burton always says at a time like that . " haveyou paid your dues, jack?
yes , sir .
the check is in the mail .
i'm not saying that i been everywhere and i done everything , but i do know it's a pretty amazing planet we live on , and a man would have to be some kind of fool to thinkwe're all alone in this universe .
honk , honk !
honk , honk !
you're going even?
i bet even .
i know it's odd .
all right , even !
another !

it's odd .
it's even .
you know it .
let's play some fan tan , buddy boy !
three !
i knew it !
heaven and earth .
what can i tell you?
ha , ha , ha !
ha , ha , ha !
did you like that one?
what did he say , wang?
in english .
something about beginner's luck , but he quits .
what is this?
it's a brand new day .
the man's still got 100 bucks .
i won't complain .
i'd have lost my shirt soon .
it breaks my heart to do this , but next time i'm down here , you'll gang up on poor oldjack .
no .
sure .
no !
not next time .
now .
i hope this won't get ugly now .
i thought what we were here , racial differences notwithstanding , wasjust a couple of old friends , both californians
ah , shit , wang .
it's only a game .
nothing or double
this knife ... cuts this bottle in half .
nothing or double .
bullshit .
nothing or double .
why?
i need the money .
i got near 1 , 000 bucks .
1 , 148, jack .
ok .
but not that bottle .
this bottle .
ok .
you're out of your mind , but god bless you !
it's all in the reflexes .
it always works at home .
have me over for dinner .
in the meantime , pay up , 1 , 148 bucks times 2 .
i can't pay .
i didn't hear that .
i'm just a poor chinese boy .
yeah?
you own a restaurant .
that's a hell of a lot more than me .
i meant i don't got the money on me .
that's what i thought .
where's your truck parked?
first , i got to go somewhere .
let's meet at my restaurant in a few hours .
whereyou got to go?
the airport .
over my dead body .
ifneed be .
i'll followyou .

i'll takeyou .
you were going to follow me .
i came to my senses .
who are we picking up?
a girl .
where from?
peking .
this is a big day in my life .
i should have gone home and gotten 40 winks .
i picked up girls from everywhere else , but never from china .
she pretty?
i'm going to marry her, jack .
oh , god !
i've known her since we were kids .
i haven't seen her in fiveyears .
i worked my fingers till they bled .
i saved every nickel to bring her here .
i can't eat or think properly without her anymore .
she's going to put my life in order .
boy , listen to me .
real tough guy , huh?
you sound a little nervous , pal .
that's why the bottle didn't slice !

long time ago , chinese men with gold rush fever flooded into california , what we call mountain of gold ,
ieaving behind theirwives and children , working foryears to complete the transcontinental railroad , saving all their pennies , and then they sent for their families to help build this beautiful chinatown you see outsideyourwindow this fine warm day .

mutual fidelity insurers of sacramento .

china is here , mr. burton .
the chang sing , the wing kong , they've been fighting for centuries .
what does that mean china is here?
i don't even know what that means .
all i know is , this lo pan character suddenly appears in the middle of an alley , and hejust stands there waiting for me to drive my truck through him !
jack , please !
hello .
hello .
when did this happen?
it didn't , uncle chu .
yeah , it did .
tall guy , weird clothes .
is thisjust a switchboard?
lo pan appeared on the street?
why didn'tyou tell me?
i didn't want to alarm you .
it's an accident , not an act of god .
look , what's your name?
mine'sjack burton .
good afternoon , mr. wong .
eddie lee , meetjack burton .
he's a maitre d '.

hello?
ha , ha , ha !
aw , christ !
the lords of death stole it afteryou ran away .
they stole my truck?
we'll find it foryou .
you're damn right you will .
money and time are important to me .
your phone is dead .
i lost a girl .
the lords of death werejoyriding , not acting on any orders from the wing kong .
theywanted a girl .
miao yin was there .
that skirmish happened because lo pan ordered the boss of the chang sings assassinated .
that was his funeral .
it was a war .
don't panic .
it's only me , gracie law .
great .
just passing through the neighborhood?
this is my neighborhood .
sure , it was a war .
anybody there went to the hell of being cut to pieces .
hell of what?
chinese have a lot of hells .
why is gracie law here?
she can't get enough of me .
you know i'm always poking my nose where it doesn't belong .
this mix up is my fault , sort of .
but i heard those punks thatjumped me took the girl they kidnapped to the white tigers for a quick sale .
who was she?
my fiancee .
the white tigers?
ifwe get there tonight , we can buy her back .
a search warrant's too complicated .
hold it .
i'm feeling like an outsider .
you are .
jack , i need more help .
i can't payyou today .
i need cash for miao yin .
it's gonna cost .
she's got green eyes .
oh , no .
that's an extra to these people .
what people?
look , this lo pan i ran over through ... has spirit medium powers .
his flesh and his bones are atomized .
he becomes a dream .
what?
that's an exaggeration .
please , help me , ok?
i got a great idea .
please , help me , ok?
i got a great idea .
relax .
i am relaxed .
i'd go with you , but those slavers know my face , and they'd want to push it in .
no , theywon't .
jack , my destiny rests in your capable hands .
i'll try .

oh , gosh .
cash , i guess .
it's not deductible , is it?
ha , ha , ha !
mrs. o'toole will take care of your needs .
i wish these were in color .
i'm in the mood for a girl with green eyes .
price is no object .
i like them fresh off the boat .
the more exotic , the better .
chinese girls do not come with green eyes .
let's go in .
it's only been 10 minutes .
give the guy a chance .

three month .

uhh !
green explosions , people flying around?
that was not real .
i want to talk to the cops .
where am i?
my office .
you sleep in your office?
these guys i mean , these storms
what are they , magicians?
sort of .
it's hard to explain .
try hard .
here .
drink .
they'd only take miao one place .
lo pan .
yes .
the godfather of little china ,
david lo pan .
the owner of the wing kong lmport/ export trading company , who's so reclusive no one's seen him in years?
who areyou?
i'm margo litzenberger .
i'm with
i've been trying to get somebody , anybody from the press to listen to me about this .
you couldn't have seen lo pan .
he's hiding .
he's got enemies
i'm getting miao yin back .
who's that?
it's ok , tara .
you can go back to sleep .
from the airport .
sure .
i was protecting her civil rights , making sure she gets a chance .
this isjust so shocking .
i must be monumentally naive .
you are .
now we have to grabyour fiancee
i'm a reasonable guy , but i'vejust experienced unreasonable things .
somebody , i don't care who , tell me what is going on .
the truth?
i can take it .
we don't know .
i'm going now !
where?
it's pouring out .
the wing kong exchange .
the most dangerous den of madmen in chinatown?
you can't waltz in there
like the wind .
i can .
as two .
i'm coming .
i'd go , but
i know .
there's a problem with your face .
sit tight .
keep the home fires burning .
ifwe're not back by dawn , call the president .
this is gonna take crackerjack timing , wang .
total concentration .
you ready, jack?
i was born ready .
i love working nights !
don't get up , don't get up .
phone company .
boys , where's the minipanel at?
probably through here , huh?
wang .
good work, jack .
i think they actually fell for it .
yeah .
hey .
last time , the problem was caused by squirrels chewing through the wires .
where's that central junction box?
i think it's down there .
what does that say?
hell of boiling oil .
you're kidding .
yeah .
it says keep out .
we've got to do something .
hmm .
goat butts against the edge , and its horns become entangled .
i haven't had the pleasure .
miss gracie law , mr. egg shen .
egg's our local authority on lo pan .
he's helping us out .
how?
it's been two hours .
let's beat down the door .
no .
we have to gather our strength .
now there's clouds and thunder ...
the image of difficulty at the beginning .
mmm .
but finally we shall bring order out of chaos .
look .
yeah .
whatyou got here is two people dragging a third .
miao yin .
you did that , right?
i guess so .
i hope so .
jack , check this out .
what is this , chinese or something?
counting backwards?
not backwards .
downwards .
of course the chinese mix everything up .
lookwhat they're working with .
there's buddhism , confucianism , and taoist , alchemy and sorcery .
we take what we want and leave the rest , just like your salad bar .
but there's one thing even david lo pan must acknowledge .
all movement in the universe is caused by tension between positive and negative furies .
when the furies are out of balance ...
as in lo pan , who is cursed ...
the people turn into immortal demon ...
an evil existing only to plague the living .
well , then , whatyou're saying is ,
david lo pan what is he , a ghost?
he plays at being a man .
a creature of vast , dark , destructive power .
we're out this hatch and up the cables .
is that brilliant , orwhat?
the cable is three stories high and covered with grease .
it's real .
at least we know where we stand .
yeah , in deep shit .
what?
what the hell?
shit !
did you think they'd let us walk in like the wind?
that was your damn point !
my point was to find miao yin and get your truck back !
i'll buy another one !
there's only one miao yin !
jesus christ !
where are we?
hell of the upside down sinners !
hiya !
uh !
uh !
uh !
hey , you .
come on over here and fight like a man .
oh , shit, jack .
i don't like the looks of this .
where are we , wang?
you are nowhere !
oh , boy .
look , we came here to see david lo pan .
ah?
david lo pan .
you have succeeded , mr. burton .
what , you?
i don't get this .
i thought lo pan
quiet !
you are not on this world to " get it .
lo pan is like
nothing you can understand .
there are many mysteries , many unanswerable questions , even in a life as short as yours .
we should still ask .
like , where's my truck?
you are looking for a girl with green eyes .
yes !
she must be something extraordinary .
oh , i'm not about to waste another 2, 000 years .
there aren't many chinese girls with green eyes .
there neverwere .
beggars can't be choosers .
i can !
tell me about miao yin , huh?
what province is she from?
hunan?
her mother , her father?
he must be a holy man .
you got a tongue , dave .
ask heryourself .
mr. burton , ifyou have influence overyouryouthful friend , exert it now !
otherwise , you will both be brought to the hell where people are skinned alive !
areyou crazy?
is thatyour problem?
he means it .
my problem is this place .
this place is my tomb .
i'm buried here .
ayoung man , a king , a warrior , is entombed in this old man's crippled body .
and all i need is a woman , mr. burton a special kind of woman with dragon green eyes to make me whole again so i may rule the universe from beyond this grave .
ching dai , god of the east .
who , him?
not me .
my demon .
the god i must appease in order to regain my heart , my blood .
a girl with green eyes to satisfy ching dai , a girl brave enough to embrace the naked blade .
i will marry her .
never !
my curse will be lifted !
you'll rule from beyond the grave .
indeed !
or check into a psycho ward , huh?
jack , will you
i'm supposed to buy this shit?
2, 000 years , and he can't find one broad to fit the bill?
there have been others , to be sure .
there are always others .
you seem to know the difficulties between men and women , how seldom it works out .
and yet , we all keep trying , like fools .
who are these people?
friends of yours?
this really pisses me off !
come on , stick around .
where's miao yin?
in this building?
safe .
where !
saferwith me than any creature on earth .
go ahead , give us the runaround .
go ahead , give us the runaround .
but this woman has a deadline , and her pen is mightier than your sword .
no visitors .
i don't make the policy .
come on , man .
give them a tour .
what's it gonna hurt?
ha , ha , ha !
i can helpyou .
you ok, jack?
yeah .
we're in a room , no windows , a few skeletons .
where's the light coming from?
the floor .
with the easing of trade restrictions ...
nextyear , we will start importing strange things from peking .
what sort of strange things?
are we going up or down?
it feels like down .
great .
great .
thankyou, jack .
i thinkwe've come up .
first we went down , then they brought us up .
two , three feet thick .
probablywelded shut and covered with brick .
that's ok .
let'sjust chew ourway out .
lo pan has plans for us .
which lo pan?
the basket case on wheels or the tall roadblock?
they're the same .
you know something you're not telling me , wang .
myths and legends .
i don't want to insultyou .
no , go ahead .
insult me .
it's about all sorts of scary things
an ancient army of the dead , the spirit city , and monkey sacrifices and the first emperor of china , that mad monarch who federated our seven warring states , defeated lo pan , and imposed upon him that curse of no flesh in 272 b. c.
chinese hear these things when we're kids .
then we grow up ... and pretend not to believe them .
no horseshit , wang?
no horseshit, jack .
i don't blameyou .
i'm chinese , and i don't even want to believe it .
but it's for real sorcery , chinese black magic .
blindfolds !
you make one move
ahh !
ahh !
now , let's try that again .
don't make me kill you .
come on !
come on, jack !
come on !
how?
hhhhhhh !
ohhhh !
aaah !
aah !
uhh !
great work, jack .
yeah .
we're all inside me , gracie , and margo .
uncle chu and egg are outside , ready to go .
here, jack .
hey , i'll tradeyou .
which way?
fast , before theywake up .
there , i think .
down there .
yaah !
no pathetic excuses .
i smell the blood of human beings .
find them !
boil them until their flesh falls off .
you heard me !
empty .
oh , miao yin .
i need you , miao yin .
you , whose eyes flash like emerald lightning .
ching dai ... make me flesh again soon ... please .
let's go .
it's clear .
safety .
oh , yeah .
wang !
aah !
first time you ever plug somebody?
of course not .
come on !
do we want to go up or down?
up or down?
up !
all has become ... strange .
a world so unreal and yet , at once so frightening .
open up !
open up or i'll blow his head off !
open !
and your souls be with his to the hell of the holy dragon .
you all right?
yeah .
margo .
jack !

would you stop rubbing your body against mine?
because i can't concentrate when you do that .
oh !
i mean really .
where'sjack?
it's ok .
everybody relax .
jack , i know where we are .
this is like a central
sewer?
yeah .
water comes in up there .
seawater from the bay .
fills this room , then diverted to different chambers .
i bet it's where we first got on that elevator .
all right .
we're almost out of here .
from here on , it gets pretty normal
offices , storerooms a nice false front .
i count to three .
i open that door .
we move out .

one , two , three .
we may be trapped .
hide !

they only saw me !
we'll fight together .

where is he?
ha , ha , ha !
you know what this is?
this is like some radical alice in wonderland .
that's it .
you've probably got a best seller on your hands .

you're not a one man army .
cops got better things to do than get killed .
uagh !
hey , there he is .
