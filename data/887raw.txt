a wimp and a blimp .
there are many great guys here , so don't feel you have to meet everyone .

larry .
ken , lonny , i'd like you to meet ...
mohammet ...
jugdish , sidney and clayton .

don't be shy about helping yourselves to punch and cookies .
i'm not going to say omega's the best house on campus ... but a lot of outstanding guys figure they'll pledge omega or won't pledge at all .
we do have more than our share of campus leaders ... something that never looks bad on your permanent record .
sure .
everybody says omega's the best , but ...
i hate to seem ... you know , pushy .
let the unacceptable candidates worry , because after tonight , they're ... ... you are ...

then you'll have lots to talk about .
i don't think you're trying very hard .
i hate this .
no sweat .
my brother fred was a delta .
that makes me a legacy .
they have to take me .
it's their law .
don't worry .
i'll put in a good word for you .
great .
i heard delta's the worst house on campus .
excuse me , sir .
is this the delta house?

norma?
no .
let me give you a hint .
she's got a couple of major league yabos .

rmer .

nother hint .
does this ring a .
bell?
" oh , god .
oh , god !
marlene .
you're going to pork marlene desmond?
pork?
you're gonna hump her brains out .
i anticipate a deeply religious experience .
why the interest in my social life?
where's katy?
downstairs , pissed off about something .
she thinks you're an immature jerk?
yeah .
i don't take anything seriously .
she'll take this seriously .
try it .
you guys coming down?

there are 50 people trying to get into this fraternity .

boon , come check this out .
excuse me .
pardon me .
ninety percent rayon !
very nice .
hi , boys .
having a good time , i hope?
excuse me .
did your mother buy that?
yes .
kent is a legacy , otter .
his brother was a '59 .
fred dorfman .
he said legacies get asked to pledge automatically .
usually , unless the pledge in question is a real closet case , like fred .
my brother .
kent , come over here .
i liked the tie .
great tie .
katy .
eric stratton , rush chairman .
damn glad to meet you .
katy !
where are you going?
home .
we just got here !
no , you just got here .
i've been downstairs entertaining some kid from pig's knuckle , arkansas .
maybe we could drive to your folks 'place this weekend .
fabulous .
my car filled with your beer buddies going up to empty my parents 'liquor cabinet?
it's too depressing to think a .
bout .
just you and me , and otter and another girl .
is this what you're going to do for the rest of your life?
what do you mean?
hanging around with animals , getting drunk every weekend?
no .
after i graduate ...
i'm going to get drunk every night .
i think i'm in love with a retard .
is he bigger than me?
greg ... what is the worst fraternity on this campus?
that would be hard to say , sir .
they're each outstanding in their own way ...
cut the horseshit , son .
i've got their disciplinary files here .
who dumped a whole truckload of fizzies into the swim meet?
who delivered the medical school cadavers to the alumni dinner?
every halloween , the trees are filled with underwear .
every spring , the toilets explode .
you're talking about delta , sir .
of course i'm talking about delta , you twerp !
this year , it's gonna be different .
this year we'll grab the bull by the balls ... and kick those punks off campus !
what do you intend to do , sir?
delta's already on probation .
they are?
yes , sir .
oh ...
then as of now , they're on double secret probation !
double secret probation , sir?
there is a little known codicil in the faber college constitution ... which gives the dean unlimited power to preserve order ... in time of campus emergency .
find me a way to revoke delta's charter .
you live next door .
put neidermeyer on it .
he's a sneaky little shit just like you , right?
the time has come for someone to put his foot down .
and that foot is me .
larry kroger .
all in favour .
we need the dues .
good .
larry kroger is now a pledge to delta .
next slide , please .
just a minute !
just settle down !
this is kent dorfman .
he's a legacy from harrisburg .
now wait a minute !
okay , this guy is a real zero .
that's true .
think back to when you were freshmen .
boon , you had a face like a pepperoni pizza , right?
and stork here .
everybody thought tha .
t stork wa .
s bra .
in da .
ma .
ged .
i myself wa .
s so obnoxious ... the seniors beat me up once a week .
so this guy is a total loser?
let me tell you the story of another loser .
get up !
let's go !
on your feet !
i ... " state your name .
i ... state your name . " ... do hereby pledge allegiance to the frat . " ... do hereby pledge allegiance to the frat .
with liberty and fraternity for all .
amen .
sergeant at arms ... do your duty .
from now on , your delta tau chi name is weasel .
from now on your name is mothball .
kroger , your delta tau chi name is pinto .
why pinto?
why not?
what's my delta tau chi name?
dorfman , i've given this a lot of thought .
from now on ... your name is flounder .
flounder?
we now consecra .
te the bond of obedience .
assume the position .
thank you , sir .
may i have another?
tha .
nk you , sir .
ma .
y i ha .
ve a .
nother?
thank you , sir .
may i have another?
now , what can we say ... of john milton's ...
pa .
ra .
dise lost?
it's a .
long poem , written ... a .
long time a .
go , a .
nd i'm sure ... a .
lot ofyou ha .
ve difficulty understa .
nding ... exa .
ctly wha .
t milton wa .
s trying to sa . y .
certa .
inly we know tha .
t he wa .
s trying to ... describe the struggle between good and evil , right?
oka . y .
the most intriguing character , as we all know from our reading , was ...
satan .
now was milton trying to tell us ... that being bad was more fun than being good?
okay .
don't write this down , but i find milton probably ... as boring as you find milton .
mrs. milton found him boring , too .
he's a little bit long winded ... he doesn't translate very well into our generation , and his jokes are terrible .
but tha .
t doesn't relieve you from your responsibility for this ma .
teria . i.
i'm waiting for reports from some of you .
i'm not joking !
this is my job .
come on , mandy , i would tell you .
are you and greg doing the dirty deed?
greg doesn't believe in premarital intercourse .
too bad .
i think he's just dreamy .
and one , two , three , four ...
company , halt !
dress that line .
dress tha .
t line , mister !
dress tha .
t line , soldier .
mister , hold my mount .
you fa .
t , disgusting slob !
you're a goddamned disgrace !
a vicious mother , isn't he?
he can't do that to our pledges .
only we can do that to our pledges .
redo those buttons !
dress that belt buckle !
straighten that cap !
and godda .
mn it , tuck up those pyja .
ma .
s !
attention !
eyes front !
what's that on your chest , mister?
it's a pledge pin , sir .
a pledge pin !
on your uniform?
hooked it .
shit .
just tell me , mister , what fraternity would pledge ... a man like you?
it's a delta pin , sir .
slice !
report to the stable tonight and every night at 1900 hours .
without that pledge pin !
do you understand?
your left arm is straight ... but you're not keeping your head down .
you're all worthless and weak !
now drop and give me 20 !
get back in ranks !
always try to hit through the ball .
i've gotta work on my game .
don't think of it as work .
the whole point is just to enjoy yourself .
i want you to fix pinto up , but it has to be a very special girl .
she should be decent looking , but we'll trade looks for ... a certain kind of morally casual attitude .
somebody he can screw on the first date .
well put .
you see , pinto's never been laid .
what did i say?
don't embarrass me in front of dave .
he's the only professor i like .
mr. jennings is a wonderful teacher .
teaching pays the rent till i finish my novel .
how long have you been working on it?
four and a half years .
must be very good .
it's a piece of shit .
would anybody like to smoke some pot?
yeah .
you ever smoked before?
sure .
when did you ever smoke pot?
i've done a lot of things you don't know about .
i won't go schizo , will i?
there's a distinct possibility .
is this right?
try not to drool quite so much on the end of it .
hey , pa .
ula .
i wa .
nna .
ma .
rry you
hey , pa .
ula .
nobody else could ever do
i've wa .
ited so long
for school to be through
i ca .
n't wa .
it no more for you
okay .
that means that ... our whole solar system ... could be , like ... one tiny atom in the fingernail of some other giant being .
this is too much !
that means ...
one tiny atom in my fingernail could be ...
could be one little ... tiny universe .
could i buy some pot from you?
give me that .
yeah , baby .
good baby .
it's all right .
you stupid ...
dorfman !
what kind of man hits a defenceless animal?

boy , is this great !
now finish it , flounder .
are you kidding?
i never shot anything before in my life .
i thought you hated neidermeyer's guts .
i do .
and the horse?
is there anything in the world you hate as much as that horse?
get it over with .
just blanks , right?
right .
holy shit !
there were blanks in that gun !
i didn't even point the gun at him !
holy shit !
there were blanks .
maybe he had a heart attack .
holy shit !
if you want the homecoming parade in my town ... you have to pay .
carmine , i think it's wrong to extort money from the college .
look ... as the mayor of faber , i've got big responsibilities .
these pa .
ra .
des a .
re very expensive .
you're using my police ... my sa .
nita .
tion people , my free oldsmobiles .
if you mention extortion again ...
i'll have your legs broken .
i'm sure i can arrange a nice honorarium from the student fund .
another thing .
you better sit on that zoo fraternity of yours .
i don't want no drunken riots in my town .
don't worry .
i've got those boys just where i want them .
we'll have the best homecoming parade faber's ever had .
mandy !
i haven't seen you since we ...
go away .
i can only stay a minute .
let me buy you lunch .
you've got your lunch .
how about some milk?
you got your milk , too .
can i just massage your thighs while you eat?
do i have to leave?
is this any way to treat an intimate friend?
i asked you never to speak to me again .
will you go away?
i do hope we're not interrupting anything .
if you must know ...
eric was just leaving .
i wasn't .
i could make you leave , if you ...
bluto !
i think you know everybody here .
greg , can't you ...
don't worry .
just keep your hands and feet away from his mouth .
don't you have any respect for yourself?
this is absolutely gross !
that boy is a p l g , pig !
see if you can guess ... what i am now .
i'm a zit .
get it?
all right , you bastard .
let's go , right here !
why don't we go out tonight?
don't flatter yourself .
it wasn't that great .
food fight !
oh , greg .
look .
it's a .
sta . r .
let's ma .
ke a .
wish .
" star light , star bright ...
wait a minute .
that's not a star .
it's moving too fast .
it's probably a 707 .
those babies really can move across the sky .
is anything happening yet?
my arm's tired .
i'm sorry , mandy .
that thing with the deltas has me a little distracted .
god knows how they've molested women .
anything?
maybe a little faster .
yeah .
how's that?
yes .
that eric stratton's lucky he's not in jail .
i'll say .
what?
you'll say what?
i'll say what?
you said , " i'll say , " when i said , " he should be in jail . " i'm trying to figure ...
if you're not even going to try , i'm going to stop .
mandy , i ...
good night , greg .
good night , mandy .
she stole your boyfriend?
her boyfriend .
and not your boyfriend?
speaking of boyfriends , how was your date with greg?
good night .
that's it .
she broke our date .
washing her hair?
dead mother .
we're in trouble .
the jewish guys said our test answers were wrong .
every one?
those assholes must have stolen the wrong fucking exam !
god , look what just creeped in .
well , well , well .
looks like somebody forgot there's a .
rule a .
ga .
inst a .
icoholic bevera .
ges ... in fraternities on probation .
what a tool !
what was that?
i said ... what a shame ... that a few bad apples have to spoil a good time ...
for everyone by breaking the rules .
put a sock in it ... or you'll be out like shit through a goose .
yes , sir .
have you boys seen your grade point average yet?
have you?
i have , sir .
it's a little below par ...
it's more than a little below par .
it stinks !
it's the lowest on campus .
it's the lowest in faber history .
well , sir ... we're hoping that our midterm grades will help our average .
laugh now ... because you clowns have been on double secret probation all semester .
double secret probation?
that means one more slip up ... one more mistake ... and this fraternity of yours has had it ... at faber .
that was pleasant .
nice of him to stop by .
we must do something .
he's serious this time .
i think he knows about the exams .
he's right .
you're right .
we got to do something .
absolutely .
know what we gotta do?
toga party .
we're on double secret probation .
we can't afford to have a toga party .
you guys up for a toga party?
toga !
toga !
they like the idea .
otter , please don't do this .
i've got news for you , pal .
they're going to nail us , no matter what we do .
so we might as well have a good time .
toga !
toga !
toga !
it's not going to be an orgy .
it's a toga party .
honestly , you're 21 years old .
in six months , you graduate .
tomorrow night , you'll wrap yourself in a sheet , pour grain alcohol all over your head .
cute , but i think i'll pass this time .
want me to go alone?
i don't want you to go at all .
it's a fraternity party .
i'm in the fraternity .
how can i miss it?
i'll write you a note .
i'll say you're too well to attend .
it's funny .
very funny .
where did he get the wheels?
from his brother .
he's letting him use it for a week .
flounder's bringing his girlfriend up for the weekend .
i am appointing you ... pledge representative to the social committee .
gee , thanks !
what do i do?
drive us to the food king !
food king !
otter , please .
what are you doing?
fixing your sweater .
there you go .
keep them under there , and keep your sweater closed .
i could get in trouble .
that's right , so ... be cool .
mine's bigger than that .
i beg your pardon?
my cucumber , it's bigger .
vegetables can be really sensuous , don't you think?
no .
vegeta .
bles a .
re sensua . i.
people are sensuous .
right .
sensual . " that's what i meant .
my name is eric stratton .
they call me otter .
my name's marion .
they call me mrs. wormer .
we have a dean wormer at faber .
what a coincidence .
i have a husband named dean wormer at faber .
you still want to show me your cucumber?
nothing for me today , thanks .
it looks like you gained some weight since you came in .
it's a prank .
i'm pledging a fraternity .
don't sweat it .
i won't tell .
the delta tau chi house is having a party tonight , and you are cordially invited .
i'm old enough to be your mother , almost .
besides , i have to go to the goddamn senior honours dinner tonight .
oh , well ...
maybe some other time .
doubtful .
maybe?
so if you're not busy , you want to go to a fraternity party?
will i be home by 12 : 00?
any time you want .
i'll pick you up ...
my dad would kill me if he knew i was going to a frat house .
okay if i meet you there?
is it okay?
it's terrific !
girls , welcome to the delta toga party .

nts it .
for shame !
lawrence , i'm surprised at you .
don't listen to that jack off .
look at those gazongas .
you'll never get a better chance .
if you lay one finger on that poor , sweet , helpless girl ... you'll despise yourself forever .
i'm proud of you , lawrence .
you homo !
my fault !
for christ's sake , carmine , how could it be my fault?
one of those goddamn fraternities , i guess .
i don't know , but i have a pretty good idea which one .
i'm gonna string them up by the balls !
i bet it was that eric stratton .
you know that for sure?
no , but ... you'd be surprised at some of the girls he's had .
very surprised .
it must have been some party .
unbelievable .
a new low .
i'm so ashamed .
almost sorry i missed it .
what did you do , human sacrifice?
no , just some harmless fun .
buy me a dinner tonight?
can't tonight .
busy .
busy tonight?
please take your seats .
this meeting of the disciplina .
ry council will now come to order .
we'll waive minutes and proceed directly with charges against delta tau chi .
sergea .
nt a .
t arms .
first , that the delta house did knowingly violate ... the rules governing pledge recruitment ... by serving alcohol to freshmen during pledge week ... and after established drinking hours .
i'd like to address these charges one at a time , if i may .
you'll get your chance , smart guy .
get on with it .
second , that for the fifth consecutive semester ...
delta has achieved a deficient aggregate grade point average .
half the houses didn't make grades .
you will speak when you're told to , and not before !
rea . d .
third ... that the delta fraternity routinely provided dangerous narcotic diet pills ...
to its members during ...
that's not true !
not another word ! ... during midterm examination week .
and most recently ... that a roman toga party was held ... from which we have received ... two dozen reports of individual acts of perversion ... so profound and disgusting ... that decorum prohibits listing them here .
these are the charges as recorded this day ... 15 november , 1962 .
faithfully submitted ...
douglas c. neidermeyer ...
sergeant at arms .
well done .
robert hoover will speak for delta house .
i don't think you can fully judge a fraternity ... without looking at the positive qualities of the people in it .
the delta .
house ha .
s a .
long tra .
dition of existence to its members ... and to the community at large .
we've heard enough , mr. chairman .
i was told i'd have a chance to ...
that's enough .
the court will now decide .
you said ...
he said that's it !
are you deaf?
let's finish this damn thing .
blow job !
i don't think it's fair !
i'll tell you what's fair and what's not !
eat me !
tell those assholes to shut up .
shut up , assholes !
do we have to listen to this?
point of parliamentary procedure .
don't screw around .
they're serious .
take it easy , i'm in prelaw .
thought you're premed?
what's the difference?
ladies and gentlemen , i'll be brief .
what do you think he's up to?
the issue here is not whether we broke a few rules or ... took a few liberties with our female party guests .
we did .
but you ca .
n't hold a .
whole fra .
ternity responsible for the beha .
viour of ... a .
few sick , perverted individua .
is .
lfyou do ... shouldn't we blame the whole fraternity system?
and if the whole fraternity system is guilty ... then isn't this an indictment of our educational institutions in general?
i put it to you , greg .
isn't this a .
n indictment of our entire america .
n society?
well ... you can do what you want to us ... but we won't sit here ... and listen to you badmouth the united states of america !
gentlemen !
order !
you're not walking out on this one , mister .
you're finished .
no more delta !

lfyou wise guys try one more thing ... one more , i'll kick you out of this college !
no more fun of any kind !
when my father was in korea , he wasn't flying .
he was in the infantry .
he was an officer , of course ...
how does it feel to be a .
n independent?
how does it feel to be an asshole?
what did he say?
hoover says we can't even enter a float in the homecoming parade .
some stupid zombies riding piles of kleenex down the street?
look !
goddamn son of a bitch !
i'll kill you , you scumbag !

i'll get my coat .
could you get three dates for my friends?
otter , holy shit !

plea .

what baffles me is why fawn would go out with boys like that .
they reminded me of criminals .
they were horrible .
i think frank was kind of cute .
i really felt sorry for him .
he started crying and ...
what did katy say?
she wasn't home .
where could she be at 6 : 00 a . m .?

women .
can't live with them , can't live without them .
you know where mandy is?
she was supposed to help make tea .
sure don't .
she said she was just going to wash her hair .
that's typical .
just when we're doing something important .
i hate to see her make such a chump out of you .
what are you saying?
i'm saying that mandy and eric stratton are having an affair .
but i love you , greg .
tha .
t's why i ha .

come on , flounder .
you can't worry forever about your mistakes .

maybe we can help you .
that's easy for you to say .

christ !
seven years of college down the drain .

that makes sense .
what's this lying around shit?
what should we do , moron?
war's over .
wormer dropped the big one .
what?
over "?
did you say " over "?
nothing's over until we decide it is !
was it over when the germans bombed pearl harbor?
hell , no !
germans?

and it ain't over now .
'cause when the going gets tough ...
the tough get going !
who's with me?
let's go !
come on !
what the fuck happened to the delta i used to know?
where's the spirit?
where's the guts?
this could be the greatest night of our lives ... but you're gonna let it be the worst .
we're afraid to go with you , bluto .
we might get in trouble .
just kiss my ass from now on .
not me !
i won't take this !
wormer is a dead man !
dead !
neidermeyer ...

bluto's right .
psychotic ... but absolutely right .
we got to take these bastards .
we could fight them with conventional weapons .
tha .
t could ta .
ke yea .
rs ... cost millions of lives .
in this case ...
i think we have to go all out .
i think this situation absolutely requires ... a really futile and stupid gesture ... be done on somebody's part .
we're just the guys to do it .
let's do it .
let's do it !
go !
go !

tommy?

i didn't expect to see you .
i never got a chance to say good night to you after the party .
they almost pumped my stomach .
can we take a walk or something?
what do you mean , " or something "?
i could get some beer .
not tonight , okay?
besides , you might get lucky without it .
before we go any further , there's something i have to tell you .
i lied to you .
i've never done this before .
you've never made out with a girl before?
i've never done what i think we're going to do in a minute .
i sort of did once ...
that's okay .
