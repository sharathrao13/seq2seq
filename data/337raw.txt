hiya , bruce .
how ya feelin '?
grub okay in here for ya?
what do you want?
that's a good question .
see , i need your cells to trigger some chemical distress signals .
you know , so you can turn a little green for me again ... and i can carve off a piece of the real you , analyze it , patent it , make a fortune .
do you mind?
i'll never let you .
i'm not sure you've got much of a choice .
come on , bruce .
aren't you feeling a little angry?
after all , you've only got me to play with now that betty's dumped you and gone back to berkeley .
you're lying .
you know , for me this is a win win situation .
you turn green , and all these guys come in and kill you ... and i perform the autopsy .
you don't ...
and i mop the floor with you ... and maybe by accident go too far and break your neck .
bad science , maybe ... but personally gratifying .
come on , bruce !
let's see what you got .
never .
you know , consciously you may control it , but subconsciously , i bet that's another story .
all right , let's jump start those brain waves .
bruce .
my dear miss ross .
welcome back .
there are two guards right outside .
you don't have to worry .
i'm not angry with you .
not anymore .
what do you want?
it's over for me now .
i know that .
and soon it'll be over for bruce .
that's why i've come to you ... to ask you if you could persuade your father , as a man , as a father himself , that if i turn myself in now , peacefully ... and before he puts me away forever , that he would let me see my son ... for one last time .
could you do that for me?
it's out of my father's hands now .
i understand .
he's a puppet now .
i don't blame him .
you shouldn't .
you should blame yourself for what you've done to your son .
and what have i done to my son , miss ross?
nothing .
i tried to improve on the limits in myself .
myself !
not him !
can you understand?
to improve on nature .
my nature !
knowledge of oneself !
it's the only path to the truth ... that give men the power to go beyond god's boundaries !
you know what's beyond your boundaries?
other people .
all you've given bruce is fear .
fear of life .
fear?
perhaps , miss ross .
and loneliness too .
yes ...
i feel them both .
but i have lived ... completely once .
i was so much in love , and she so much wanted a baby .
my baby .
i could tell from the moment she conceived ... that it wasn't a son i had given her ... but something else .
a monster , maybe .
i should have put a stop to it right then , but i was curious and that was my downfall .
and as i watched this tiny life unfold ,
i began to imagine the horror of it , and my curiosity was replaced ... with compassion .
but they took away my chance to cure him .
your father threw me out .
what are you doing?
i remember that day so well ... every moment , every sensation ... walking into the house , the feeling of the handle of the knife in my hand .
i knew i was doing a father's work , fulfilling a father's mercy .
david , please stop it . !
no . !
david , no . !
talk to me . !
listen . !
but then she surprised me .
no . !
no . !
david , no !
it was as if ... she and the knife ... merged .
no !
you cannot imagine ... the unbearable finality of it .
and in that one moment ...
i took everything that was dear to me ... and transformed it into nothing more ... than a memory .
bingo !
that must be some jumbo nightmare he just had .
okay , do it now .
start the enzyme extraction .
sir , negative on drill penetration .
damn it , drill him harder !
give him full rpms .
come on , holeman !
come on !
should i neutralize?
no !
i can't do anything with goop !
come on !
all right , put him to sleep .
it's not stopping him . !

i'm requesting a national command authority override .

initiating afterburner .
i'm passing flight level 600 .
this is out of my envelope .
hang in there , legend .
i can't maintain .
he's all over my aerodynamics .
he'll lose consciousness before you .
nine fifty .
i can't hold it .
i'm pulling back !
puny human .
contact .
he's in the water .
all units , weapons hot .
let's not take any chances .
you are cleared to fire on target , legend .
dad?
betty?
we don't have a choice .
i have to destroy him .
but you can't .
you will only fuel his rage , and you will make him stronger .
it's you he's coming for .
you know that .
then let me go to him .
please .
just give him a chance to calm down .
this area has been declared restricted airspace .
all aircraft are ordered to clear the airspace immediately .
echo , one niner .
weapons are hot .
target acquired .
waiting your orders to engage .

i repeat , hold your fire .
echo , one niner .
roger that .
go go , go , go , go , go !
hold your fire until my command . !
engine 24 to command .
we are in position now .
you found me .
you weren't that hard to find .
yes , i was .
let's take a walk .
that's the deal , gentlemen .
he stays on this base ... until we get the final word from c 3 on how to dispose of him .
in the meantime , ifhe does anything but sit there in that chair , we're gonna turn on the juice and he'll be incinerated immediately .
we've established a 200 yard perimeter , sir .
if we deploy the electromagnetic array , there should be no collateral damage .
here they come . !
i'm doin 'this for you , betty .
but one way or another , we're gonna have to prepare for the worst .
i should have killed you .
and i should have killed you .
i wish you had .
i saw her last night .
saw her face .
brown hair .
brown eyes .
she smiled at me .
she reached down and kissed my cheek .
i can almost remember a smell .
almost like desert flowers .
her favorite perfume .
it's my mother , and i don't even know her name .
it's all right , son .
you go ahead and cry .
go ahead and cry .
cry .
crying will do you good .
don't touch me !
maybe once you were my father , but you're not now and you never will be .
oh , is that so?
well , i got news for you .
i didn't come here to see you .
i came here to see my son .
my real son .
the one inside of you .
you're nothing but a superficial shell , a husk of flimsy consciousness ... ready to be torn off at a moment's notice .
you can think what you like .
i don't care .
just go !
no , son .
listen to me .
i found a cure .
for me .
my cells can transform too , absorb enormous amounts of energy .
but , unlike you , they're unstable .
son , i need your strength .
i gave you life .
now you must give it back to me !
only a million times more radiant , more powerful !
stop it .
stop?
stop what?
stop what?
think about all those men out there in their uniforms ... barking and swallowing orders , inflicting their petty rule over the entire globe !
think of all the harm they've done !
to you !
to me !
to humanity !
and know this ... that we can make them ... and their flags and their anthems and their governments ... disappear in a flash !
you in me .
i'd rather die .
oh , that's your answer?
then indeed you shall die ... and be reborn ... a hero ... of the kind that walked the earth ...
long before the pale religions of civilization ... infected humanity's soul !
go !
stop your bawling , you weak little speck of human trash .
all right ...
i'll go !
you just watch me go !
hit it .
hit it again !
we can't , sir .
there's no power .
some kind of counter electromagnetic field .
move in and assault the target .
move in . !
move , move , move !
sir , i've located them on radar .
pear lake .
call up the task force .
yes !
that's right .
keep fighting .
the more you fight , the more of you i take .
strange .
we're reading a phenomenal drop in temperatures there .
but simultaneous radiological activity .
they're absorbing all the ambient energy .
sleep now , bruce , and forget forever .
struggle no more ... and give me all of your power .
you think you can live with it?
take it !
take it all !
oh , yes !
yes !
take it back !
it's not stopping !
take it back !
gentlemen ... release .
gamma charge away .
mwah !
sweet dreams .
hello?
betty , is that you?
hi , dad .
i'm glad i caught you .
i'm glad you called .
thanks .
look , betty ... you and i ... well , we both know that bruce couldn't have survived that blast .
but ... well , you know ...
what is it?
well , you know .
the usual loonies .
seein 'things .
only now everything's green .
right .
look , uh ... if by some chance he did survive ... and he should try to contact you , try to get in touch , you'd tell me , wouldn't you?
no ...
i wouldn't .
but you know as well as i do , i wouldn't have to .
i mean , my phones are bugged , my computer's tapped .
i'm under surveillance .
i'll tell you , though , that if he were alive ,
i'm the last person i would want him to come to ... because ... as much as i miss him ,
i ...
i ... loved him .
i , um ...
yeah .
i'm sorry , betty .
i am so sorry .
i know you are .
si .
let's take a walk .

* as long as you're kept full of pretty bodies *
* your little secret will be safe with me *
