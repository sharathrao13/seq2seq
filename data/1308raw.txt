you said , " wrap .
it was a figure of speech !
why is he in his underwear?
the tux has to be back ; he used his mom's credit card .
i'll drop it off on the way ; it's no big deal .
we kidnap him and make stops along the way?
brilliant !

i think we're the ones that get a big gift .
crappy mart shoppers , the store is closed .

all right .
okay .
look , carmine , kidnapping , accessory to a jewelry heist , coupled out with your rap sheet , you're looking at 20 years .
twenty five ...
unless you want to play ball .
i could do 20 years standing on my head , boys .
as i'm sure you could .
you know , carmine , i've got to be honest ,
it's devastating .
tragic .
lf angelo marcello is worried you'll talk , he might hear you're upset about getting passed over for promotion .
you know how rumors fly .
like rockets .
to the moon .
do you take your show on the road?
go to schools?
keep kids off drugs?
because your little puppet show , very entertaining .
yeah?
who do you think is pulling strings?
clearly , angelo marcello is pulling the strings .
and if he thinks that you're talking , you're going to be doing a lot more time six feet under .
unless , unless , and i'm just thinking out loud here , but um ... unless you actually do talk , then we can at least help you out .
six accused members of the marcello crime family , including mafia boss angelo marcello , were found guilty today of twelve counts of extortion and racketeering .
prosecutors credited the victory to testimony of longtime marcello crime family member ,
carmine " the beans " pasquale .
pasquale is now believed to have entered the federal witness protection program .
let's go live ... ... not being able to see her great grandson no more ,
grandma florentino is gonna be heartbroken .
oh , please !
when she came from the old country , the statue said ,
give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses ...
know why they huddled?
she was beatin 'the crap out of everybody with that wooden spoon .
you know what , carmine?
the place may change , but you'll always be a jerk .
will you guys shut up?
oh !
you do not talk to me like that .
you know what this is?
rap music .
it breeds disrespect like a fungus .
slim shady , puff daddy .
he goes by p diddy for short .
for short?
why?
it takes all day to say " puff "?
oh !
i'm exhausted .
look who's talking about names .
they call you carmine " the beans .
yes , because i grind my own beans for coffee .
a nickname has to be married ...
what?
you're no longer known as " carmine the beans .
you're george , linda , and patrick cheeseman .
cheeseman .
what is that , french?
who's patrick?
who's george?
because i ain't no " george .
i ain't no " george , " either .
i think linda's a beautiful name .
i always wished my mother had named me linda .
should've named you " chatty kathy .
i ain't no " patrick .
they call you " pat " for short .
pat " is a girl's name , and i ain't no name that goes both ways .
look , we have driver's licenses , birth certificates , bankcards , social security cards , and supermarket rewards cards .
they're all made out to george , patrick , and linda cheeseman .
well then , i'm going by " rick , " because i ain't no " pat .
so , agent banks , where we moving to?
mr. and mrs. cheeseman , i'm special agent tuttle .
welcome to utah .
okay , the arrangements have been made for you to stay in a hotel tonight , then provide you with a vehicle .
how many wives you got?
you're not a mormon?
i am .
the church hasn't practiced polygamy for 1 00 years .
it's the offshoot groups that still have plural wives .
you'd have to shoot me .
having one is bad enough .
it'd be nice to have more than one .
give me a break from you .
i'll grab your bags .
we're right out here .
take a break .
fine .
go ahead .
find me somebody else .
preferably someone without a mustache and a bad attitude .
this looks like a whole lot of nothing .
actually , it was a desert wasteland when the mormon pioneers arrived in july of 1 84 7 .
under the leadership of president brigham young , the entire area ...
you work for the park service or the fbl?
patrick , there's a lot to do ...
it's rick !
there's a lot to do just a day's drive from here .
we've got the grand canyon , there's hollywood , disneyland ...
disneyland .
my old man promised to take me and you know what?
took off and never came back .
i haven't had much desire to visit there ever since .
i'm afraid it'll bring up too much repressed anger .
yeah?
so , take a prozac like a normal person .
so , what's the neighborhood we're moving into like?
i received a page .
i have a family emergency .
we'd like to excuse bishop harrison who's had to attend to a very important family matter .
our concluding speaker will be brother chris moore .
brother moore .
it's okay .
hang on , brother moore .
let me try and get this a little higher for you .
brothers and sisters , i'm grateful for the opportunity to stand before you this ...
hang on .
it's moving , it's good .
it's coming .
thank you .
sorry to hear about bishop harrison's dad .
when are they leaving for the funeral?
first thing in the morning .
they're worried about how his mom's going to handle the farm alone .
he'll be gone 3 4 weeks to sort things out .
with the bishop gone , does that mean we won't have church?
no , sweetie , with the bishop gone , your daddy's first counselor to the bishop and he'll be in charge .
he certainly had things under control today , didn't he?
thanks for the support there , jewels .
anytime , bro .
exactly when are your parents getting back from the philippines?
two years , ten months .
you got a countdown?
technically she is my aunt , but i despise her like a sister .
there's a " sold " sign on the cooper house .
when did that happen?
i don't know .
it has been vacant for a while .
be nice to have someone in there .
he had eight stitches .
yes , i just got off the phone with his wife .
with bishop harrison gone for who knows how long , the inmates are running the asylum .
michael james in charge?
please .
mom .
sister johnson's on the phone .
hold on , robin .
mary jo , did you hear?
eight stitches .
what?
are you sure?
when?
run to the cooper's house and see if there's a " sold " sign .
mom .
i wonder who's moving in .
this place is a shoebox !
it's a great house , george .
we got a satellite , right?
actually , we cover the house , but amenities are extra .
the government pays three grand for a military toilet seat , but they can't pop for hbo?
i can't believe it .
why not send us to the amish?
because they sent us to the mormons .
yeah , same difference .
honestly , no , it's not .
right because the amish wear black shirts and ride in buggies , but the mormons wear white shirts and ride bikes .
completely different .
okay .
look , george ...
i hate that name .
mr. cheeseman .
worse .
this right here is your first month's stipend .
you'll get a few more until you're on your feet .
what do i do for a ride?
you'll get that red minivan .
are you kidding me?
i think it's real cute .
you would .
you drove an amc pacer when we met .
i loved it .
i was heartbroken when it got stolen .
you still think it got stole?
i paid butch 20 bucks to drive it into the river .
why are you complaining?
i bought you a new lroc z.
oh !
hi .
i'm chris moore .
these clowns are stealing my stuff !
we're your neighbors .
we're just here to help .
oh .
don't break nuthin '.
george , you've got to understand people here are friendlier than what you're normally used to .
yeah , here two days , and no one has flipped us the bird .
i don't want friendly .
i just want to be left alone .
hi .
hi .
i wanted to welcome you to the neighborhood .
thank you .
please come in .
thanks .
um , i'm louise means .
i'm linda cheeseman .
this is my husband , george .
nice to meet you , george .
these are for you .
thank you .
have a seat .
oh , thanks .
so , where did you move from?
omaha , nebraska .
you have a slight eastern accent .
we're from the eastern side .
so , anything you want to know about the neighborhood or the neighbors?
i got a question .
you're not going to come knocking on my door 8 : 00 am saturday , are you?
why would somebody do that?
come on .
i know you people .
it's what you do .
you go door to door , knock , knock , knock , talking to people , preaching your mormon bible .
meanwhile , inside are staying down trying not to make a noise , so you think we're not home .
so , you're not members?
members of what?
louise hasn't wasted any time burning up the phone lines
letting people know they're not members of the church .
i just hope she hasn't offended them .
we'll do a little damage control .
we'll show them the rest of us are just regular , normal people .
um , we can see you've got a lot of unpacking to do .
we didn't want to intrude .
we just wanted to come over and introduce ourselves say " hello .
no , it's no intrusion ; it's very nice of yous .
something to drink?
oh no .
no , let us get you something .
okay , great .
thank you .
i'll get you a beer .
uh , no .
that's okay .
you said okay .
all right .
whatever .
how bout you , toots?
um , no , no , i'm fine thanks .
what're you thinking?
she's not going to be drinking while she's pregnant .
why not?
you did .
actually , we don't drink at all ... alcohol .
ls that a mormon thing?
yes , we don't drink alcohol .
we got coffee .
hey , that website i would get my imported coffee from , what was that called?
i don't know .
i'll google it .
it's okay , because we don't drink coffee , either .
we'll , go to the kiddy menu .
i'll get you a coke ; and you a diet coke .
you're not going to believe this .
um , there's some members of our church that um , choose to drink cola drinks , but michael and i , we happen to not drink cola drinks .
what do you do for liquid refreshment?
what , is your mother still nursing you?
thank you so much .
yeah .
goodnight .
goodnight .
nice to meet yous .
thanks , you too .
bye bye .
that was interesting .
yep .
uh , hello , ma'am .
i'm rick cheeseman .
we just moved in down the street .
i'm blanche brinkerhoff .
nice to meet you .
blanche , louise means is on the phone .
i'll call her back .
i was just walking around meeting the neighbors and uh ,
i was wondering , do you know those people with the satellite dish?
that's bishop harrison's .
i knocked , but nobody answered .
they're out of town .
really?
i see .
hey , you wouldn't happen to have a ladder and some power tools , would ya?
i still have homework .
which you wouldn't have if you hadn't been on the phone .
lf i still lived in california , i could see my friends and not worry about making time for phone calls .
and making time to get up earlier to do your homework , because now it's time for bed .
good night .
i hate this place !
you know , we need to make an effort and reach out .
really?
i was thinking more along the lines of a padded room with a big lock , and the only contact is to slide food through this tiny , little slot .
what?
i'm talking about dealing with your sister and her attitude .
i was talking about the cheesemans and their not being members .
what do you mean?
well , i've just been thinking .
i know what it feels like to be the minority .
my dad moves us down to the south , and suddenly , i'm the only mormon in a high school filled with born again christians .
i mean , i was voted most likely to burn in hell .
i think dealing with your sister comes in close second to eternal damnation .
didn't i get you dr. phil's book on teenagers?
you said were going to open it .
ten stupid things women do to mess up their lives .
seriously honey , i know she's your sister , and i love her .
i do ; but something has to be done .
okay .
all right .
i'll , uh , i'll talk to her .
i promise , i'll ...
a little tough love .
you will?
sure .
okay .
thanks .
and about the cheesemans , why don't i call linda tomorrow and see if they want to come to dinner?
yes , yes .
good .
that would be nice .
i just , i don't know ,
i gotta do something , with the bishop gone gotta step it up a notch .
don't worry .
you're doing a great job .
don't stress .
the cheesemans will fit in just fine .
excuse me , uh .
how you doin '?
that's my paper .
oh yeah .
here you go .
you live here?
yeah .
yeah .
we're neighbors ... over there .
that ... house .
yeah , well uh , my wife and i were thinking about coming over tonight or sometime or ...
do you mind , uh?
what?
oh yeah .
sure .
that blonde girl .
that's your wife?
nice .
hey , you got one like that , who needs twelve?
ugh , this coffee is awful !
really?
what do you mean " really?
you think i'm lyin '?
nah , i believe you .
no , no you don't .
you're questioning me .
it wasn't a question .
lf there was a stenographer here writing down our little jovial repartee here , she would have typed , " really " with a question mark .
i've had a lot of stuff read back to me that i said that i didn't remember saying .
i meant i was surprised that it was bad .
how could you?
don't you drink it?
nah , i don't drink coffee .
let me guess .
you're mormon .
yeah .
maybe that's why mormons don't drink it .
because no one knows how to make a good cup .
you know what , just give me the paper and a pick six .
a pick six of what?
numbers .
winners .
you've got to be kidding me .
besides not making good coffee ,
utah ain't got no lottery either .
they got no horse track .
they got no lottery .
they got nuthin 'up here .
how far away is vegas?
i don't know , but don't talk about vegas .
these people are the good , church goin 'type .
that's another thing .
i'll go in there , i'll eat their crappy , white bread food , but i ain't holdin 'hands , and i ain't singin 'no " kumbaya .
take those off .
these people invite us to dinner .
you're gonna be pleasant .
i'm just sayin ', if they bring out the bible pictionary gone .
a perfect game for you ; no words all pictures .
that's very funny .
let me tell you something .
let me tell you ...
hi .
the kids are already started .
everybody , this is the cheeseman family .
uh , george , linda , their son rick .
kepi , laura , a couple of friends .
how ya doin '?
nice to meet yous .
you remember kate .
hi , so glad you could make it .
and uh , several of the children here .
we've got more running around here someplace .
shocker !
hey , we brought you somethin '.
oh , thanks .
you shouldn't have , really .
we wanted to .
it's not booze or nuthin '.
yoohoo !
you shake it .
it's good , right?
yeah .
so george , what did you do in omaha before the move?
i was in waste management .
then that's what brought you out here?
ln a manner of speaking , yeah .
how 'bout you , big guy?
what's your story?
how's that?
i haven't seen black people in utah .
did you get lost on your way to somewhere?
no .
i'm not black ; i'm tongan .
i don't keep up with the whole politically correct thing .
you know , i mean , first you're negroes .
then you're blacks .
now you're african americans .
now you're the tongans?
i don't think it's as catchy whatever .
no .
i mean i'm from tonga .
it's a south pacific island .
oh , like " survivor .
i love that show .
i bet it's very clean there .
we moved here for my husband's health .
the air is better .
yeah , there's no cigarette smoke .
let me ask yous , is that like the body is a temple sort of thing?
what's that?
the no smoking .
oh yeah , yeah .
it's a health code that the church practices .
i'll tell you something .
i have seen some of the biggest , chunkiest people
i have ever seen in my life waddling around utah .
that was rude to say !
that's not rude .
it's just , it's the truth .
you've given up smokes ; you've given up booze .
maybe should think about giving up baked goods .
chungaloones over here .
we should have made fruit salad .
no , no .
i don't mean yous .
fifty , a hundred pounds overweight , that's not a big deal .
i am talking about fat people .
people walk down the street , and you go , " fat guy !
look at this guy .
he is a fat guy .
guy on jerry springer 1 7 00 pounds .
what does he do for halloween?
white sheet over his head and he goes as one of the alps?
what?
this is michael with bishop harrison a few years ago .
let me ask yous two , are you like what , assistant ministers?
well , uh , we're what you call " counselors to the bishop .
like the consigliere .
we also have full time jobs too .
our work at the church is voluntary .
that's right .
that's right .
i know you don't have anything lined up yet .
i mean i could go into work and talk to my manager about you if you'd like .
oh , that'd be great .
this is so nice .
look at all this you got here .
you even saved your kid's hospital ld tag from when they was born .
you know what?
lf you're interested , there are a ton of scrapbooking stores around here .
it's really popular .
there's stores where people come to save their junk?
oh yeah , they do very well .
besides , it's not junk .
it's preserving memories .
preserving memories?
what are you going to preserve?
what , old cocktail napkins with guys 'phone numbers on 'em?
okay .
who wants desert?
sorry about my dad ; he's kind of got a big mouth .
you know what?
he's hysterical .
my family is so boring with their domestic tranquility lifestyle .
your brother seems like kind of a cool guy .
yeah , whatever .
he was my last resort .
i lived in california before my parent's moved to the philippines .
my dad had to become a mission president over there .
so jacked up .
i didn't want to go , so i had to come here .
your dad was a mission president .
what's that?
those guys that come to your door to talk about the mormon church .
mormon missionaries .
yeah .
well , the mission president is the really old guy in charge of all those young guys .
i thought it would be cool to give the mormons the jehovah's witnesses 'addresses and the jehovah's witnesses the mormons 'addresses .
have 'em go at it
like religion's version of the bloods and the crips .
do you ski?
no .
i might do something , if i don't want to die of boredom .
at least you have a satellite dish to entertain you .
you saw that?
your secret's safe with me .
hey , no boys in the room .
you know the rules .
that was at home .
i didn't know that applied here .
same family , same rules .
i'm sorry , sir .
i didn't mean to disrespect .
you didn't know .
listen , we've got cake .
come on .
i'm watching my weight .
watch it downstairs with us .
let's go .
rick , have you thought about going out for sports at the high school?
uh , no , probably not .
really?
you seem like the kind of guy they could use .
yeah?
like what kind of sports?
you know , the regular ones .
baseball , basketball , wrestling ...
wrestling?
you mean like , you know , busting heads , fightin '?
well , it's not like on tv .
no , no , no .
it's fighting .
the beauty is , it's sanctioned by the school .
they let you !
beat the crap out of kids , and i don't get calls from some p . o . 'd vice principal sayin ',
your kid beat up this one , he threatened this guy over here .
no fuss .
i'm not involved with you .
i love it !

but it's not fighting .
no , no , it's not fighting at all .
wink , wink , nod , nod .
i getcha .

oh , so you're a brother already?
you know what , sweetheart?
george is visiting .
let's leave him alone .
yeah , i can uh , yeah , i can read a story to children .
what is this?
the three little pigs?
i don't need a book .
i know this story !
you ready to hear it?
all right .
antonio , joseppi , and fredo .
antonio , he lived in a straw house .
and fredo , nice brick house with the cobblestone driveway and the lights underneath that show the trees at night adds to the curb appeal .
one day , antonio , in the straw house , is sittin 'around , pickin 'his teeth , watchin 'television , when he hears a knock on the door .
it's a soft knock .
the door's made of straw .
outside he hears , " big bad wolf ,
i'm here to collect my protection money .
this is money that the wolf charges them every month not to eat them .
protection money .
they'd give money in an envelope .
antonio was just sick of it .
he doesn't want to pay the wolf .
so antonio says , " forget it !
i'm not payin 'you anymore !
now , this of course , makes the wolf very irate .
so , he says , " i am gonna huff , i am gonna puff , and i am gonna b b b b blow your house down !
antonio is very , very upset , and the wolf huffs and he puffs ... blows it down .
now , antonio is losing his little pig mind , running around screaming and yelling .
his house is ruined .
he's got no insurance .
he runs to his buddy joseppi's house .
boom , boom , boom .
" he blew it d " " yes , he blew it down !
come on inside , sit down , have an espresso , relax .
they're freakin 'out .
next thing you know boom , boom , boom .
who do you think it is?
big bad wolf .
exactly .
the big bad wolf .
wolf says , " all right , i'm a huff .
i'm a puff , and i'm gonna b b blow your house down !
there's sticks all over the street .
people are slipping and falling like a john woo film .
it's crazy !
now these two pigs are out of their ... minds .
don't know what to do .
they run to their buddy fredo's with the big brick house .
boom , boom .
he blew down our house .
fredo says , " all right , come in .
help .
he's gonna cut us .
he's gonna eat us .
fredo's like , " please , have an espresso?
calm down .
relax .
i'll take care of it .
fredo is as cool as a cucumber .
walks over to the phone .
he dials some associates and hangs up the phone .
the next thing you know ... big black cadillac limo pulls up in front of fredo's brick house .
two goomba pigs in dark suits get out .
they say ,
excuse me .
you the big bad wolf?
he says , " yeah .
they pick him up by his lapels and start bangin 'him against the side of the house , crackin 'his brain against the wall !
then the pig reaches into his pocket , pulls out his 9mm , puts it against the wolf's temple badabing !
they blow his brains all over his suit .
boom !
uh , george , i think we're ...
this is the best part .
i think we probably ...
this is the best part !
trust me !
then antonio and joseppi they go , " fredo , who was that?
fredo goes , " ah , those guys?
those are my cousins , the guinea pigs .
guinea pigs ...
never mind .
the end !
yeah !
yeah !!
good kids , good kids .
hey , tell you what kids , here .
go get yourselves some ice cream .
that's fine .
seriously .
what , it's ice cream?
they get an allowance ... garbage and things they do ...
eh , it's thirty bucks .
it's no big deal .
well ...
hey , how are you?
good to see you .
so , what's goin 'on with that thing?
i looked into the thing .
and?

hinges , i can take care of that .
let me introduce you to george here , first .
he just moved in a few weeks ago .
this is president perry .
he's a stake president , we call that .
he's a sort of the leader of many of the local congregations .
like a president .
like president of the mormons?
something like that , yeah .
what , you want to be the teamsters now?
the mormon jimmy hoffa?
did i mention that george is from omaha?
my son served a mission to omaha .
bet he knocked on your door .
well , if he did , i didn't answer it , mr. hoffa .
the hinge aisle , president , is just over in this area .
i'll take care of this .
great .
nice to have met you .
wife's got 'im working .
yeah , what?

here .
you don't got a saw at home?
all right .
you want it exactly in half?
preferably .
as close as you can get .
you have used one of these before?
yeah , but not to cut wood .
kate .
oh , louise , you startled me .
i'm sorry .
i'm just out for my morning stroll .
i noticed when the postman put the mail in , the postcard from your in laws in the philippines .
oh .
it's nice to see things are going well for them .
thank you .
yeah , you know , normally i'm not one to pry into other people's affairs .
no , of course not .
i thought you should know , the other night i was taking a walk , and um , minding my own business , of course ...
of course .
with the cheeseman boy .
and?
he's not a member of the church .
ah .
who knows what his values are .
i mean , to encourage them to socialize .
i mean really .
well , i thought that you and your husband , with him being in a position of leadership , would want to set the standard for the community , you know .
you know what , louise?
we are setting a standard .
we had the cheesemans over for dinner .
it's called " friendshipping .
you know what?
you should try it sometime .
i see .
hmmm , i hope so .
patricia?
yeah , it's louise .
the end of your first big day .
bringin 'home the bacon .
my old man used to say success comes in a pair of overalls and works eight hours a day .
it feels good .
do you feel that?
it feels good .
yeah .
all right .
i'll see you tomorrow .
eight hours a day , forty hours a week !
how do you people do it?
huh?
good afternoon , ma'am .
i'm looking for the owner .
yes , i'm the owner , francis eastlack .
mrs. eastlack , i'm brigham smith from scrapbookers local 327 .
from where?
scrapbookers 327 .
it's the local scrapbooking union .
i didn't know scrapbookers had a union .
well , you're supposed to .
you're also supposed to pay your union dues .
union dues?
yes , ma'am .
how many employees do you have?
six .
two full time and four part time .
well , as you know , it's $50 a month per person .
that's for the full timers .
for part timers we have to charge double dues because we find that they exert a bigger suck on the pension and health programs .
so , that's two workers at $50 a month , four at a $1 00 a month .
that's $500 a month you have to pay .
i have to pay?
yes , ma'am .
i thought employees paid for things like that .
what kind of money do employees make?
minimum wage .
and it looks like you're doing pretty well here .
it's a beautiful store .
well , yes .
that's why you're responsible .
let's talk about back dues .
now , unfortunately , i'm not able to wipe out an entire 1 2 month period of back dues .
however , what i can do is i can only go back three months .
so , that's this month plus three months of back dues .
that would be $2, 000 you have to pay .
that's a lot of money !
ls it mrs. eastlack?
ls it really?
don't you think it's in everyone's best interest?
you wouldn't want a strike now , would you?
strike?
oh yes , ma'am .
your employees parading up and down that beautiful sidewalk , carrying large signs , and screaming about how unfairly they're being treated .
we are very fair .
exactly .
that's why you have to pay the $2, 000 .
well , will you take a check?
do you have a driver's license and a major credit card?
what can i get you?
yeah , could i get a pound of your capicola?
i'm sorry?
capicola .
produce section is back there .
it's not produce ; it's ham .
we have boiled ham .
i don't want boiled ham .

who was that?

pineapple?
pineapple?
who puts pineapple on a pizza?
canadian bacon and pineapple .
it's very popular here .
folks said to try it .
you don't put pineapple on a pizza !
it's like putting pepperoni in a fruit cocktail !
it's something you don't do !
i wanted to try something new .
i though we were havin 'manicotti .
i needed something easy , i'm goin 'out tonight .
there's a women's night at the church .

no , but now i have friends .
it's nice to socialize .
with them?
with june cleaver?
it's nick at night with these people .
and what's wrong with that?
they have values !
hey , take those off .
leave the kid alone , will you?
it would be nice to have some dinner conversation .
he's got nothing to say !
you got something to say?
bop !

some guys from church are havin 'this paintball thing in the mountains .
kids your age?
it's the guys .

what's the matter?
it would be nice , yous getting together and doin 'something fun like that .
why do i wanna go?
i got a house .
it's freezing cold outside .
i'm not goin '.
that happened with the donner party .
them people they froze .
they ended up putting themselves on their own pizza .
you know what , this is ...
i'm outta here .
forget it .
i'm gonna go get something to eat somewhere else , and not in the woods .
let me get this straight .
you're telling me you are the largest wholesale distributor of scrapbooking materials in the entire state of utah?
and most of ldaho .
no kiddin '.
where you were from again?
save all memories of the children .
what is that?
you heard of " save the children?
well , we save all the memories .
what our organization does , in a nutshell , is we raise money for underprivileged children all around the globe , so that they can keep a scrapbook .
these little tikes , they're gonna grow up , they're gonna 'become doctors and lawyers and such , and with these scrapbooks , they're gonna be able to refer back and see how far they've come .
that's very considerate .
i agree .
how else we gonna know about these kids?
you've seen them .
it's truly sad , with the bloated bellies and the flies flyin 'around them .
how we gonna know bout 'em if there ain't someone there takin 'pictures while the flies are buzzin '?
we'd be more than happy to donate scrapbooking materials .
i appreciate that ; i really do .
thing is , we already got us a government contract to purchase the scrapbookin 'supplies .
all we're looking for quite frankly , and there ain't no way to sugarcoat it , is financial donations .
it's for the children .
yeah , salt lake city to rio de janeiro , brazil .
this friday .
do ya got something in the morning?
i'll take that .
first class .
one seat .
and , no .
one way .
yes .
you know , rick , after dinner we'll check out the paintballing equipment if you'd like .
hey , thanks .
and thanks for letting me stay for dinner .
oh , it's our pleasure .
but shouldn't you call your parents so they know you're here?
oh no , that's fine .
they got into another fight .
dad took off and mom drank a whole bottle of white zinfandel .
she's facedown , you know , wasted .
so this works out fine .
so you ever actually played paintball before , rick?
oh , no .
really?
not everyone's rambo .
some people lead civilized lives indoors .
it's a shame your dad couldn't make it with us .
he told me about his doctor's appointment .
he told you he had an appointment?
yeah , that's why he won't be coming paintballing with us .
i thought this was going to stay in the family , but i guess we can confide in you .
why , what's wrong?
well , dad dad's got to get a colonoscopy .
oooh , wow !
what's a colonoscopy?
look on the lnternet .
no , no , no , no .
it's just a doctor's appointment , honey .
look rick , i don't want you to worry .
it's probably nothing , really .
i had an uncle ; he had a colonoscopy .
it was a buffalo head nickel that he'd swallowed when he was two years old .
they got it back too .
mint condition .
thing tripled in value .
there isn't a paintballing merit badge yet , but some are working on it .
i like to use this space to practice .
we'll set up targets .
have you ever actually shot a gun before , rick?
well , uh ...
well , it's pretty easy .
use the rifleman approach the chuck connors .
keen haw , keen haw .
i like that .
some prefer sort of the delicate princess leah sort of a feel .
you know what i mean?
you're right .
that's pretty cool .
look at that , yeah .
i was thinking of having that painted soon .
i'll put up some targets to shoot at .
how bout that?
hey , it's pretty fun .
ahhh !
yeah , you're right .
that was fun .
yeah .
hey .
hey .
what's your problem?
you've been acting weird all day .
my problem is when friends come and spend the night hanging out with my brother .
so?
you was hangin 'out too .
a good time is not to hang out with my brother .
i had a good time .
lf a good time is hangin 'out with my brother , you've got problems .
you said you had the problem .
i did .
shhh .
look , my brother is a complete dork .
and his wife is this little homemaking nazi .
your brother and wife are good people , and probably your mom and dad too .
you want nuthin 'to do with them?
that's another problem you got .
technically , that's just an extension of the problem .
shhh !
well , then you got one really big problem .
all right , i'm goin 'to lunch .
hello .
george , it's special agent tuttle .
hey , how you doin '?
we need to talk .
come on .
i just started lunch hour .
that's perfect .
let's go .
ls your car parked out front?
all right , fine !
fine !
i did the scrapbooking thing .
big deal !
you're doing scrapbooking?
see , that is so cool .
this going straight thing has worked for you .
it's opened up a myriad of hobbies and interests .
when i got married , we started scrapbooking .
then we took scrapbooking and combined it with genealogy and made books ...
la , la , la , la , la .
you see this?
this is my " don't care " face .
now , we're not here for the scrapbooking thing?
what are you doin 'here then?
all right .
agents in atlantic city collared a rocky delfurio on a calling card scam .
do you know him?
yeah , he's like , he's an old timer with gagliano's crew , right?
right .
he wanted to cut a deal in exchange for information .
everybody's a stool pigeon .
he actually had a lot to offer , george .
he lead investigators to an area in the pine barrens .
there were an old farm and well , it had been dried up for years .
there was a concrete slab placed over the top of it .
it was at the bottom of the well ... they found the remains of your father .
i'm so sorry , george .
at the time your father was involved in some importing operation .
a guy named jimmy lanucci tried to muscle in .
your father and lanucci had some words , and one thing lead to another .
lanucci's been doing a 1 2 to 1 5 on another wrap in tallahassee .
he's up for parole in six months but he's not going anywhere now .
the office sent me all of your father's personal effects to give you .
there's a gold necklace with a gold crucifix .
a gold ring .
a gold chain with a squiggly thing .
a money clip , no money .
gold , though .
a gold watch .
gold bracelets .
something else gold , i don't know what that is .

and a travel brochure to disneyland
with three plane tickets to los angeles .

so you got that doctor's appointment this weekend?
uh , yeah .
you know , i'm sure it's nothing to worry about , really .
rick , he told me everything .
he's concerned .
what are you talking about?
look , i know it's a sensitive subject , and i want you to know i feel for you .
i had an uncle who had a colonoscopy .
so?
look , i want you to know if anything unusual comes up that we are here for you .
look .
i'm not having a colonoscopy .
you're not?
no .
you know , george , you're over 40 .
i mean , this is the time ...
we are not having this discussion !
lgnoring the situation isn't going to make it actually ...
you know what , i'm sure your doctor ...
all right , you know what?
i lied .
i made it up .
i got no doctor's appointment , no colonoscopy , nuthin '.
i made it up so i wouldn't have to go out with you into the woods to play army patrol .
happy?
okay .
you know , rick is really excited .
let me ask you a question .
why do you care about me and my family , huh?
what is your ...
you get me this job , you bring me to church , you invite us to dinner , and now you inviting me into the woods .
what , you need more converts?
there aren't enough mormons in this state?
no , no , george , it's not anything like that , really .
i just i consider you a friend .
i want you to feel like part ...
oh no , i do .
i do .
every time we go walkin 'people close their drapes when they see us .
part of the community?
ah , see , you know , there's a saying about mormons by mormons , and it says that the church is true , the people aren't necessarily .
and what does that mean?
but i suppose you think you're great?
no , george , i don't think anything about myself .
i'm sorry .
i just i just happen to think that you're a great guy .
you have a great family , and i want you to feel happy here .
that's all .

lf i wanted to shoot you robby , you'd be dead already , right?
that's a nice gun you got .

you should be eating candy and popcorn and crap .
i like it though ; i like the granola .
i'll tell you what i'm gonna do .
i'm not gonna shoot you .
but you tell us where your home base is so we can capture your flag and win .
it's the other side of the hill .
don't lie to me kid !
i'm not lying .
my sixth sense tells me when people are lying , especially little kids !
i'm gonna ask you one more time !
where is your home base?
i'm not lying .
all right .
i'm gonna shoot you .
your day's over .
okay , it's on the other side of the stream down by the cliffs .
okay .

don't be stupid .
ah , man !
now i can't keep playing .
yeah .
that's the point .
but , i didn't shoot you , did l?
let's go .
hey , what should i do with this?
leave the gun ; take the granola .
punk .
you have fun?
yeah , i did .
it was great .
it was fun , huh?

yeah , that's not all you was doin '.
see that kid?
comes around the big boulder and sees me squattin 'there?

i love it .
you know what?
i got a good idea .
why don't we go home , get cleaned up , and take your ma to dinner?
yeah , where?

naples .
route 45 .
get a big panzorotti .
baked or fried?
who you talking to?
deep fried .
remember?
but you know what?
i'll bet nobody's got no naples , and nobody knows nuthin 'about no panzorotti .
lsn't that a sports car?
no .
that's a maserati .
i said panzorotti .
it's like , picture this .
take a pizza , fold it , throw meat and cheese inside , deep fry it , done .
oh , you mean a calzone?
no .
no .
look at me .
does it not look like i know the difference between a panzorotti and a calzone?
maybe i don't know the difference .
bingo !
nathan .
i'll tell you , today's your lucky day .
you're gonna learn .
get me an apron ; i'll show you how to make panzorotti .
i'm gonna show you once , so pay attention .
all right?
all right .
first thing you do , you turn the dough into crust .
roll it out nice .
make a nice ball .
nice thin crust ; that's the key .
throw in your red sauce , around the edge , not too much .
you throw in your sausage , your pepperoni , then your ...
what is this?
a pineapple .
pineapple .
now it's garbage .
fold it over .
you make your seam .
you throw it in your deep fryer .
nice and brown .
like that , right?
then you stuff it in your face .
yeah , mike is covered in paint , and we find the kid .
dad makes him tell where his base is .
no loyalty , this kid .
total stool pigeon .
boo hoo , i just want to keep playing the game .
he told us everything .
i would've blasted him right off .
you see?
that's the problem with kids today .
it's all about the violence .
be smart .
true coercion is an art form ; it all starts up here .
so we find the flag , we grab it and start booking it for camp .
i'm glad you twos had a good time .
we did , didn't we?
yeah .
yeah , i was thinking maybe ... spring comes , it gets a little warmer up in the woods , the three of us , we go , do like a camping weekend .

i don't think so .
you two go .
i have a house .
why do i wanna go?

that's for me to know and for you to find out .
give to your people the joy of continual health in mind and body with the prayers of the virgin mary to help us .
guide us through the sorrows of this life to eternal happiness in the life to come .
i told you it's a hi tech world , and we gotta get an lt guy?
the jamook who every time i got a problem with my computer tells me to turn it off and on .
i get to thinking , that special coffee
carmine always says he can't live without ...

i want you to handle this personally .

we've seen you here before , but would you mind standing up and introducing yourself again?
i don't want to .
come on .
it's easy .
it's the thing we do .

hey , it's the missionaries .
hi , elders .
fbl .
freeze !
they know where we are now !
george , relax .
we've got them in custody .
they're willing to make a deal .
you see this?
you can't trust nobody .
but it's perfect .
now we're spinning a story that they got picked up before they got to you , and you're completely unaware of this .
lf angelo thinks he's failed , he'll send somebody else , and that we use as leverage .
of course , he's gonna send somebody else .
what happens when somebody else gets here?
we are dead !
george , we're going to protect you .
right .
trust me .
you got this mormon family , catholic family ,
living next door to each other .
so each family has a little four year old kid .
one's a boy ; one's a girl .
it's summertime .
the kids are playin '; they turn on the sprinkler .
they figure , " eh , we'll strip down to our birthday suits , " right?
they're running around .
little boy looks at little girl and goes ,
oh !
look , there really is a difference between mormons and catholics !
all right .
i just got one more thing i wanna ...
what are you gonna do?
hey , uh , folks , if i could have your attention .
now , i know you don't drink , or smoke , or have fun .
of course , i'm kidding .
but i would like to raise a toast with my caffeine free diet pepsi and share with you an old ltalian toast .
chi trova un amico , trova un tesoro .
which means , " he who finds a friend finds a treasure .
chindan .
chindan .
put your cups down !
that's not appropriate .
for heaven's sakes , that's the appearance of evil .
well , uh , thanks for having us guys .
this was great .
oh , you're leaving?
yep , we gotta go .
saturday night mass .
wanna to stay for desert?
i left the ricard pie on the table .

thanks for comin '.
that was nice .
yeah .
aside from the food , that was great fun .
you know , i've never heard a toast at a church dinner before .
that was a first .
well , george is a good guy .
yeah , they're good people .
according to a spokesman for the fbl , notorious mob figure carmine " the beans " pasquale and his family , known to neighbors as george , linda , and patrick cheeseman , were in the witness protection program for just over a month , when this apparent mob retaliation took place .
lnvestigators say ...
it's all over the news .
hello .
president perry .
i knew there was something suspicious about them .
what if that explosion had happened when we were nearby?
it could have been a tragedy !
brothers and sisters ,
i bring you condolences for this incredible tragedy .
you knew this family and their effort to get a second start in life , and i understand many of you here embraced them , as you should , as neighbors .
now , i have other news .
with bishop harrison's recent loss , he and his family have decided to permanently relocate back east to assist with his parents 'farm .
we therefore need to release bishop john clayton harrison as bishop of the mountain view ward with michael lsaac jaymes as first counselor and kepi vakasiwola viahani as second counselor .
those who can offer a vote of thanks for their service , please join me in doing so .
would the following individual please stand ; as i read his name , we ask for your vote .
as the bishop of the mountain view ward ,
michael lsaac jaymes .
all those who can accept michael jaymes as your bishop , please indicate .
no , i don't think so pal !
what?
george , we're trying to keep a low profile .
i gotta pay for meals in coach .
he says i look like i'm goin 'to a barry manilow concert .
george , you're in disguise .
keep it low key .
you could have done better on these getups .
it's temporary .
your plane leaves in 1 5 minutes .
okay .
now , be assured .
angelo marcello thinks you're dead .
i wish i was dead with these clothes .
you have no imagination .
are you sure nobody suspects a thing?
no .
everybody has bought this , including your neighbors .
we've kept a tight beat on the community and what people are saying .
you might be interested to know your friend , mike jaymes , was called to be the new bishop today .
really?
well , not for nuthin '.
he's good people .
i can see why .
apparently not everybody can .
what do you mean?
ln the mormon church , when called to any position , everybody in the congregation has to vote on it .
now , 999 times out of 1 000 everybody votes in the affirmative .
what happens on the 1 000th time?
once in a while people will vote against it .
so , so what?
somebody didn't want to vote for mike?
actually about half the congregation .
what?
i've got to admit , it's almost unheard of .
how could anyone have anything bad to say about mike?
we're here tonight for you to voice your concerns .
i asked brother jaymes not to attend to allow everyone to speak freely .
i have known michael jaymes for years .
we're not going to find anyone with more dedication .
you know , i think i speak for a lot of people here when i say he may mean well , but at what expense?
what if one of us had been killed because michael jaymes invited a mobster to wander the halls of our church?
but he didn't know .
the federal government sent them here .
there should be a law against that .
or some law notifying us that these people are moving in .
it's the witness protection program !
lf we know they're here , they're not protected .
then who is going to protect us?
that mobster thug scared my son to death and ate his granola !
exactly .
michael jaymes invited a wolf into our little flock of sheep .
that is the most ridiculous thing i've ever heard .
oh !
can i , uh , say somethin 'here?
thank you .
um , well , we're not dead .
that little magic show you saw yesterday was courtesy of the fbl .
they did it to trick some people i used to know .
and we're movin 'away from here now .
but the feds have big ears , and i heard what was going down here with uh ... with mike jaymes and what some of you think about him , that you believe he's responsible for bringing in a wolf amongst your sheep .
and my life these days has been all about saving my own skin and looking out for number one .
actually , my whole life's been that way .
but i figured when i heard about this sit down today , it's a good opportunity for me to stand up for someone who done right by me .
someone like mike .
so ...
i just wrote down some notes .
you know i heard one time that the mormon church is true , but the people ain't .
i don't know if the mormon god is the one true god .
i'm not a prayin 'man .
i have heard many people say their prayers .
but i can tell you , if there is one ounce of truth in the mormon church and i relied on the people in this room to find out about it ,
i'd never know .
some of you people wouldn't give me and my family the time of day .
that aside , you do have one good thing going for ya ,
michael jaymes .
that guy cared more about me and my family than i did .
and he showed me what's really important in life .
lf he can do that with a guy like me , imagine what he could do with people like you .
so , i don't know if it counts , but mike jaymes has my vote .
hey !
what , we need an engraved invitation?
i smell dinner ; i don't know about you guys .
so , the feds have their undercover guy .
he's worked in with angelo's crew , he tells 'em that what went down was real ,
angelo believes we're dead .
so did everyone else .
it had to be that way .
but when we heard about what happened ...
i hadda come back and say my piece .
so any idea where you're heading now?
none .
as long as they don't put pineapple on their pizza , i'm fine .
and good coffee .
i don't know .
coffee almost got me killed this time around .
i'm thinking there's something to this whole mormon health code thing .
oh , hey .
president .
hi .
i wanted to tell you .
what?
congratulations , bishop .
ha , ha , ha .
everybody sustained me?
no .
but i never said everybody had to .
all i wanted to know was why they didn't .
but you're where you need to be , bishop .
the rest will come around .
look at you .
the mormon jimmy hoffa over here !
lf i were you , just in case you ever disappear ,
leave a note saying to look for you under the goalposts at the b yu stadium .
okay .
he has no idea .
i don't know if you can write , but if you can , here's the address to my parents 'home in the philippines .
your brother's kickin 'you out?
nah .
i decided i'm going to live with my parents .
it's sort of trying to find a solution to my problems .
i thought it was a big problem?
then it might get a little smaller .
oh !
let's go !
i gotta go .
thanks for everything .
good luck with the baby .
thank you .
all right .
come on , get in .
good luck with everything .
be good .
be safe .
you take care of yourself .
oh , hey .
one more thing .
mike , could you do me a favor?
yeah , sure .
can you deliver those?
but , i need you to do it personally .
what are they?
refund checks .
thanks .
aloha , bishop .
see ya .
take it easy .
bye .
i love these .
you put the little bubble on the picture ,
like it's a comic strip .
oh , that's cute .
