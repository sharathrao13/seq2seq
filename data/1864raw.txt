how you doing?
we run a freight outfit when the weather cooperates .
boss spearman .
and the marksman here is charley waite .
is all that true , what you said in the caf?
yeah .
there's a kid at the doc's house put on death's doorstep by baxter .
doc's wife's caring for him until he comes back after the storm .
doc's wife?
yeah .
miss barlow .
you mean sue?
that's right .
well , she'd make somebody a fine wife .
but she ain't the doc's .
that's his sister .
his sister?
ain't his wife .
good evening , mack .
ralph .
ray , cory .
whiskey .
this is ralph peterson .
he runs the general store .
that's where i was when the dog got free .
you fellers the free grazers , i expect .
no offense .
personally , i don't stand with others around here about free grazers .
there was a fight in your store about a week or so back .
some of baxter's men jumped our friend .
he was a big feller .
yeah .
i saw the whole thing .
that big feller drubbed the hell out of them other three .
broke one's arm .
be a gunhand named butler , would it?
that's what they say .
felt bad about your friend .
is he all right?
he's dead .
that's too bad .
seemed like a nice young feller .
it's a shame what this town has come to .
you could do something about it .
what?
we're freighters .
ralph here's a shopkeeper .
you're men , ain't you?
i didn't raise my boys just to see them killed .
well , you may not know this , but there's things that gnaw on a man worse than dying .
hey !
evening , gents .
evening .
better get out of this weather , or your bones are gonna be even stiffer than mine .
heading into the saloon to do just that .
come looking for you boys .
i'd have bought you a drink if you was earlier .
then turn around and do it now .
marshal's got men waiting to waylay you back at the livery .
another one's in your wagon .
and then there's another in the shed across from it .
marshal with them?
no .
he's sitting up there all by his lonesome in that warm , dry jailhouse with his feet up waiting for them to bring you in .
or kill you .
well , thanks for the warning .
like i told you , never been partial to the marshal's ways .
dent baxter's either .
you're near the only friend we got in this town .
i'll be buying a drink or two .
you keep it quiet , all right?
time's come .
how you want to play it?
well , i work for you , boss .
i'll play it however you want .
nobody works for anybody here , charley .
now , the name butler mean anything to you?
you hear names when you're on the other side of things .
he as fast as they say?
he's a killer .
know him if you saw him?
he ain't hard to recognize if you know what you're looking for .
yeah .
too bad if we get shot up tonight before we get a chance at him and baxter .
sure as hell is .
tell you what , i'd like to sit someplace dry while the marshal's men sit out in this rain .
won't be so steady come morning .
small town .
it's hard to hide even at night in this weather .
what do you want to do?
yep .
heard me an idea sounded pretty good .
you did , did you?
well , all right .
he's alone .
get your hands up .
you must be plumb crazy .
shut up .
you're dead men .
didn't he tell you to shut up?
what's that?
chloroform .
stole it from the doc's .
you gonna arrest me for that , marshal?
jesus .
well , looky here .
he's asleep .
no .
looky here .
put 'em down .
this way .
what do you think?
do you like it?
you like it , you son of a buck , you?
huh?
a little bit more?
a bit more?
a bit more .
wasn't no call to leave me setting out like that .
there wasn't a lot of time .
i ain't bait , charley .
i hear you .
best you remember it .
well , i guess you ain't gonna let me forget , are you?
starting to enjoy that part , aren't you?
sorry if we woke you .
no , no .
you didn't .
come to see if ...
go see for yourself .
hey .
hey , boss .
hey .
you gave us a fright , pard .
thought we was gonna lose you .
just taking a little nap , that's all .
it's good to have you back .
we owe you , miss barlow , and we thank you .
you best thank god instead .
yes , ma'am .
we'll ... give that a try .
well , i expect you men are hungry .
button just ate .
i thought i'd make myself some breakfast .
two more mouths wouldn't be any bother .
i'm just gonna change .
you .
you should try to sleep .
he will .
now , you do as she says now .
yes , boss .
okay .
boss?
yeah?
mose?
i'll be along in a minute , charley .
be seeing you , button .
aah .
lf you don't mind my saying , ma'am , you look ...
tired .
oh .
it's been a long night .
why don't you sit?
let an old cowpoke cook up some breakfast .
no , i couldn't let you .
sure , you could .
thank you .
i want to apologize for earlier .
oh , no , no .
there's no need .
you were startled .
no , it was more than that .
i've been trying to put some bad times behind me .
but sometimes they don't stay put .
always makes me feel better to let things breathe a little .
not bury them .
i'm learning that .
trying , anyway .
well , that's all any of us can do .
just glad button's getting better .
don't believe i've ever seen boss so worried .
well , the doctor will be on his way home as soon as the storm's passed .
by the doctor , you mean your brother?
it's just we've been thinking that you and the doc was ... husband and wife .
oh .
you did?
didn't find out till last night .
thought you was married , sue .
why , no .
i'm ...
i'm not , charley .
well , that's good .
i mean that's good to know .
otherwise , we'd been thinking wrong .
we wouldn't want to do that .
no .
no , of course not .
much obliged to you , ma'am .
you're very welcome , mr. spearman .
thank you , sue .
take care of yourself , charley .
are you just gonna go off like that without saying nothing?
ain't nothing to say .
i seen how you look at that gal and the way she looks at you .
it ain't right to walk away without a word .
what do you want me to tell her , boss?
we probably ain't gonna make it?
be a big fat comfort .
i don't know what you should tell her , charley .
i wish i'd have said more to my wife before she passed .
this may be the last time she sees you in this world , charley .
or you her .
so tell her whatever you can .
'cause she's entitled to more than just your backside walking away .
charley .
i'm not sure what's worth saying or not .
well , you don't have to say anything .
yeah , i do .
boss is right about that .
he's right about a lot of things .
it's just ...
i'm not who you think i am , sue .
i've ... been places .
i've done things .
most of them , i'm not proud of .
you know , i always hoped somebody gentle and caring might come along .
years pass .
a small town and all .
and your hopes begin to fade a little every day until you hardly remember what they were .
i've seen who you are , charley .
the way you looked after that boy and the respect you give boss .
it might be little bits .
but they're enough for a woman who looks .
men are gonna get killed here today , sue .
and i'm gonna kill them .
you understand that?
yes .
i want you to have this .
it's always brought me luck .
i ... can't take your locket .
it's not your choice when it's a gift .
it's a good likeness of you .
it's my mother when she was young .
she's beautiful .
i want you to know that if i don't ever see you again that i meant everything i said to you and i appreciate everything you said to me .
ain't nothing that happened in this old town been a surprise .
except you .
i'll be seeing you , charley waite .
happy?
yeah .
lf you are .
morning , boys .
brung you breakfast .
hey , you kids .
come away from there .
come on .
you get along .
what do you suppose this looks like?
it don't matter .
whole town knows there's a fight coming .
they just hope it don't spill over to them .
well , if i'm gonna get killed ,
i got a hankering to soothe my sweet tooth .
morning .
morning .
what can i do for you fellers?
thinking about some candy .
candy?
yeah .
yes , sir .
candy .
got anything you want .
got jawbreakers .
yeah .
gumdrops , candy canes , licorice , caramel , honey crisp .
jujubes , lollipops , milk chocolate ...
looking for something special .
now , what's the most expensive you've got?
well ...
ooh .
i got just the thing .
this is dark chocolate .
yeah .
it comes all the way from switzerland , europe .
that's near france , see .
they call it bittersweet .
melts in your mouth .
you tried it?
no .
how do you know it melts in your mouth?
well , truth is we can't afford it ourselves .
mm hmm .
i'll take two .
don't you want to know how much?
nope .
yes , sir .
and three of your finest cigars .
my friend and me got a hankering for switzerland chocolate and a good smoke .
now , these come all the way from havana , cuba .
thank you .
anything else?
no .
that'll do it .
how much i owe you?
it's ... $5 .
charley .
here you are .
believe i'll enjoy these later , boss .
yep .
you ought to do yourselves a favor and ride on while you still got time .
tried minding our own business .
this is good .
worth every penny .
you're gonna get yourselves killed .
try that , ralph .
go on .
sitting right here in front of you .
never even tried it .
shame to go forever without taking a taste of something .
charley , let's go .
percy !
up here !
brought you a cigar .
all the way from havana , cuba .
you don't say?
i've heard about them , but i never had one .
much obliged to you .
what do you think?
better than them crappers i usually smoke .
so , you're gonna make your stand down here?
yeah .
but out there around our wagon .
not much choice without getting a lot of innocent folks shot up .
like to place some guns and ammo where we can get to it on a short run .
help yourself .
we'll try to stay out of your barn .
might not be able to .
best bring in your livestock .
be wishing you good luck now .
thank you .
it's a pretty day for making things right .
well , enjoy it .
because once it starts , it's gonna be messy like nothing you ever seen .
i ain't survived my years without being in some fights , charley .
i ain't doubting your grit , boss .
you got more than any man i ever known .
it's just that ...
i don't mean to be hard .
it's just the other night , them fellows back in them trees we let go .
it was my call , charley .
i can see now it was probably a mistake .
it's not what i meant .
i mean , maybe it was .
but the fact is it's what i always respected about you .
what i always appreciated .
how you treated other people and how you treated me .
how you never look for no trouble .
that kept me from trouble .
but it's found us here , boss .
and if we're to have any chance , you'll ...
you go on and talk , charley .
i'll hear you .
i'm almost certain they'll be overly confident in their numbers .
especially if we're standing right out here in front of them .
it's not like we'll have any advantage .
but if they're out there with us , then they won't have as much as they might have otherwise .
i don't figure all of them to be killers .
only two or three like butler will have done much of it .
i'll be looking to him .
the others will be hired men .
probably saddle tramps .
maybe ex army .
the rest will be cowpunchers .
they won't want to line up in front of us .
it'll happen fast once i start .
so just keep yourself moving forward .
and they'll either move or root .
maybe even freeze up .
it don't matter which .
you just start right in on them with that scatter gun .
when you've done both barrels , drop it , pull your pistol , and make a run for that building where we stashed them others .
i'll be trying to do the same if i can .
right .
sounds like you got it all worked out .
yeah .
except the part where we don't get killed .
best smoke these while we got the chance .
yeah .
i'm thinking about getting out of the damn cattle business .
you never said nothing except nag me and button about getting ourselves out .
well , maybe my own words struck a chord .
thought maybe i'd sell off the cattle and have enough to start up a saloon somewhere .
man could stay cool in the summer and dry in the winter .
some dancing girls might be nice , you know?
have to get me some .
yeah .
lf i die , please sell my good horse and my good saddle and my guns to buy a tea set for miss barlow .
charley waite .
postscript
i like this one .
but i don't know .
princess pattern .
oh , hell .
what's the matter?
oh .
looks like you waited too long .
kind of like us and free grazing .
well , good is good .
melted or not .
looks like you're plumb chained , to your work , marshal .
get up , poole .
he ain't worth a damn .
get them all up !
sobered up !
ooh .
i got a feeling there's gonna be a new marshal in town .
all right !
it's time to settle these free grazers .
oh , you leave your horses .
we're walking down to their wagon .
when we get there , you better empty your guns in them .
or i'll damn well shoot you myself .
now , you three skirt the buildings .
get into the alleys on the side .
come on .
hayley !
come away from there .
finish these later .
okay .
i'm not going to my maker without knowing your given name .
mine ain't waite .
it's postelwaite .
charles travis postelwaite .
what's yours?
sure ain't boss .
i mean it , boss .
i'm asking you straight up .
it's bluebonnet .
bluebonnet?
bluebonnet , yeah .
no middle name?
no , just bluebonnet spearman .
and don't you tell no one .
i want to hear you swear an oath .
now , go on .
i swear it .
all right .
okay .
just in case .
said eight .
count five .
you should have run when you had the chance , spearman .
not much for running from cowards .
i see the marshal ain't with you .
you won't find it so funny when you're all shot to hell and dying .
you the one killed our friend?
that's right .
i shot the boy , too , and i enjoyed it .
hayley !
back up !
where's the back door?
back door !
right this way .
it's locked .
you hit?
i'm good .
you .
you get out of this house !
you pull that trigger , baxter , and you can forget about me patching you up .
you get your bag .
you're with me .
go on .
get the hell up , poole !
on your feet , god damn it !
yeah !
you're ... going out there .
we ain't ourselves yet !
i see they hobbled you .
it's been a while since i was in a fight .
i panicked .
fell back .
like to have broke my foot .
ornery old fool .
well , or that damn cuban cigar got me riled up .
charley .
you two wait here .
hold on , there , charley .
hold on .
i ain't looking over my shoulder the rest of my days .
charley .
you said we was gonna kill them all .
i aim to do just that .
i meant kill them .
not murder them .
splitting hairs , ain't you , boss?
mister , i heard what you said .
i won't come after you .
i promise .
no , i expect you won't .
i ain't gonna let you do it , charley .
you do this , you ain't no different than poole or baxter or that gunhand of his that murdered mose .
him killing mose is how this started .
we come for justice , not vengeance .
them is two different things .
not today , they ain't .
step aside !
listen to him , son .
you done what you had to here because they give you no choice .
don't go making this into something bad .
this ain't the way , pard .
mister , thank you .
thank you .
didn't do it for you , boy .
just make peace with your bad deeds .
sue !
get in here !
oh , my god .
get out of the way .
button !
put it down .
let the lady be !
we got your boy , spearman !
you better drop them guns and come walking down the street or i shoot him .
you've got ten seconds !
we ain't giving up our guns .
he's gonna kill button anyway .
one !
the only chance for him or us when we walk up is these guns .
two !
three !
sue !
stop !
stop it !
stop it right now !
four !
sue .
you're a disgrace , marshal poole .
you always have been .
i know it .
that's just the way it is .
five !
six !
have a nice rest , did you , marshal?
you'll be having a long one yourself in a minute .
been enough killing for you?
be enough when you're both dead and buried .
let the woman and boy go .
they ain't a part of this .
lf you want considerations , you drop them guns on the ground .
let her take him to the doc's .
the doc's in jail , and he ain't leaving unless your guns are in the dirt .
i'll crush any man who stands with them !
when i finish that ,
i'll torch your homes and drive your wives and children out into the cold prairie .
so you women , you better take hold of your men .
lf you don't , you'll be raising orphans by winter .
mack langly !
it doesn't matter whether you run or stay !
you and your boys are already dead !
mack langly is our friend !
i didn't come all the way from lreland to see my land pissed on by free grazers .
now , i want them guns in the dirt .
him first .
the gunhand .
looks like you're losing your army , marshal .
get down !
it went through?
yeah .
is he hit , sue?
sue , is he hit?
no !
no !
but he's bleeding bad again !
god damn it .
can you stop it?
i'm trying .
i'm gonna kill you , baxter !
well , come on , if you're coming !
can you cover me?
might be best to wait him out .
probably bleed to death .
i ain't waiting .
button needs that doctor right now .
well , you know , that door's locked .
well , it won't be when the scatter gun hits it .
i'm waiting for you , spearman !
i'm coming for you , you son of a bitch .
okay , charley?
yeah .
you ready?
yeah .
i'm dying .
and for what?
more cows?
killed a good man .
and maybe that boy out there out yonder .
you get no sympathy for your death .
get !
you're ... nothing .
yeah?
maybe so .
but i'll still be breathing in another minute .
well , kill me , then .
no .
i ain't wasting a good bullet to ease your pain , you son of a bitch .
your man's in the saloon .
ordered everybody out .
asked to see your sister iffen she's willing .
he'd like to speak with you , miss barlow , iffen you ain't offended by entering a saloon .
sue .
doc .
bring him on up .
put him in there .
we'll make room .
baxter got any kin?
daughter is all he has left .
it'd be right if somebody explained things to her .
there never was any love lost between 'em .
even so , she's his daughter .
and kin is funny about such things .
come on .
come on .
i didn't mean for you to have to ... walk into this place in front of those people .
i don't care what anyone out there thinks , charley .
you don't have to stand up for me .
well , just the same ,
i wanted to tell you that i'll be leaving in a day or two .
i'd like you to stay .
i think others would , too .
i can't say i haven't thought about it .
truth is , there wouldn't be a corner here that don't have a bad memory for me .
i've been holding my love a long time , charley .
i know you feel something for me , too .
i do .
but i ain't no more than those who come to kill us .
you seen that yourself .
maybe you've done some bad things .
maybe worse than bad .
but what happened here today wasn't one of 'em .
and those killings , they don't give you pause?
i'm not afraid of you , charley .
it brought me luck .
just like you said .
it's yours now .
you keep it .
i don't have the answers , charley .
but i know that people get confused in this life about what they want and what they've done and what they think they should have because of it .
everything they think they are or did takes hold so hard that it won't let them see what they can be .
i've got a big idea about us , charley .
and i'm not gonna wait forever .
but i am gonna wait .
and when you're far away , i want you to think about that .
and ... come back to me .
i'm in love with you , sue .
been that way since i first laid eyes on you .
just took me a while to see things clear .
i know i'm not the kind of man you expected to walk up your front walk .
lf i was your brother , i wouldn't choose me for you .
charley ...
do you know how old i am?
don't care how old you are .
i'm not a girl anymore .
you're the handsomest woman i ever saw .
i've had my disappointments , charley .
well , i'm not gonna be one of them .
i never thought i'd live as long as i have , sue .
i guess living the way i have , it never really mattered .
but thinking i was never gonna see you again was maybe ...
was maybe the most awful feeling i ever had in my life .
i know i can be a good husband to you .
and i know i ain't asked you proper .
but i'm asking you now .
will you marry me , sue?
charley .
yes .
i'll marry you .
and can i kiss you?
i'm gonna give you a thousand of these before i'm done .
hey , charley !
looks like the doc changed his mind about you .
something wrong?
no .
everything's fine .
i forgot to tell you i'll have word about the saloon by the time you get back .
sounds good .
you take care , now .
charley .
sue .
i'll be along .
saloon?
told you i was wanting out of the cattle business .
there's a saloon right back there just had its owner die .
hoping you'd be my partner .
i can't afford something like that .
not even half .
well ... you let the brains of the outfit do the thinking .
sue
you are coming back , aren't you?
then i'll be waiting for you , charles postlewaite .
you bucketmouth !
can't keep nothing private .
gotta go back now .
don't want you to lose sight of the rooftops .
i mean it , sue .
you gotta go .
how's this gonna work if you don't do what i say?
i told you i'm gonna give you a thousand of these before i'm done .
i'm gonna make sure you do .
let's go get our cows .
