april 1941 .
somewhere in serbia ...
sun is rising
on saturday
voice is coming
from away
poor people from around
wait for the sun to come
to belgrade , to belgrade
with krstic co .
the people are getting ready
they have all the reasons for travelling
but luck have they not
i am unfortunate
since i was kid
with all my sorrow
i sing songs
i wish , oh my mother ,
that all this was only a dream .
oh little roses
hear the pain of my heart
and cry with tears
to soothe my sorrow .
i bring a message from krstic
they have a flat tyre .
really?
they are lying !
it is true , grendpa '.
how do you know?
last time i missed audition because of them .
listen , tell them that they must respect the time table !
if they said that they depart at 5 , it must be at 5 !
right !
not a minute more !
it's none of my business .
excuse me , how much there is 'till the next bus stop?
what next stop?
i mean , if i go now , when will i get to the next stop?
man , you are crazy !
thls is a bus stop !
the next stop is behind that wood .
i guess around 5 km .
i can't wait , who knows when will the bus .
and maybe i catch something .
goodbye !
is it serious?
tuberculosis , isn't it? !
they don't know what it is
but it seems there is no cure for me .
you are young , you will make it .
that's what makes me sad , i am so to say in best years .
you have at least had enough of life .
so i can die? !
i didn't mean it that way .
you rascal , god damn you !
get away from me !
please folks , easy !
i beg you , easy !
excuse me , my lungs .
forget excuses , i live of singing from lungs !
open it !
where?
inside .
is the front doors for you?
the rear doors are closed .
so it means you have to wait , not to run to the front .
aha !
it will not make it , you know .
eh ... thanks for telling me , i didn't know .
daddy !

yes , son .
daddy , should we start?

you are talking to me?
yes , you !
i will not allow drunken passengers !
first , i am not drunk at all .
than you have to shut up !
that's the last thing i needed !
sober people also to start singing !
can i cry then?
if i let you through my hands , you will cry like never before !
old man , do you want that i stop the bus and throw you out?
can i ask you something , honestly?
can i travel without a ticket?
i carry the money to my son in the army , every dinar is important to me .
you must buy the ticket .
come on , leave the old man alone .
you will not go bankrupt because of 20 dinars .
you can see that he is broke .
who is poor? !
me? !
give me flve tickets !
how much?
five !
let us see who is poor !
one will be enough .
five or nothing !
it's not possible , man !

you are crazy !
rules are rules .
drive on , misko !
when we arrive in belgrade , we go to my sister .
and tomorrow morning we travel to the sea .
what sea?
what do you think why i have escaped from the house , now , when we are married?
i want to see the sea .
why haven't you said it before?
'cause you wouldn't have come !
if you don't want , go back home .
there it is , go stay alone .
ok , don't be mad .
i go .
daddy , when we arrive in belgrade , will we go to the zoo again?
off course , misko .
he likes animals so much .
in the zoo i can't get him off the cage with monkeys .
'cause they are so funny !
nice boy .
shame on you !
how can you do that in front of all this people !
get out and do what you want !
what is the matter , old man?
he is my husband ; at least he can touch me !
i would prove if they have marriage certificate at all .
show me the marriage certificate .
everything is in order .
but , no touching in the bus .
what is it now?
this is no bus stop .
if there was law and order , they would have been banned to drive .
they do what they want !
scandalous !
where have you been? !
can i cut?
go on !
daddy , piggy !
stop , my piggy !
i will kill both conductor and his son , if army barracks in belgrade closes !
old man , you could lose your wallet !
thank you , son .
put it better in the jacket , someone could steal it from you .
who would dare to steal something from me? !
i survived two wars !
the two over there .
those steal even when you look at them .
i would kill if they only touch my pocket !
i quit smoking to save money for my son !
if you have time , buy me a sack of salt , and we will compensate for this .
off course , brother .
excuse me , if it is no secret , what kind of rocks do you collect?
coloured and sparkling .
excuse me , where do you take it?
to a scientist .
bride , listen : if the bean is there i give you 10 dinars
if not you give me 5 .
all right .
once more?
beware , bride !
they are thieves .
you will lose all your money .
we travel whole morning for only 20 kilometres !
who is in a hurry he can walk .
are you really putting those pigs in the bus? !
where should i put them?
on the roof? !
ridiculous !
what is much is much !
do you know that in belgrade i earn more on one pig than on all your tickets?
we depart !
daddy , are the pigs eating?
hold that steering !
he doesn't watch the road !
two years ago , for a bet , he drove 2 km with tied eyes and hasn't even scratched the bus !
surely he drove , but what?
what , he didn't? !
two km with tied eyes?
come on !
don't provoke him !
misko !
have you driven 2 km with tied eyes , ha?
i don't like when people are making up .
daddy , he doesn't believe me !
let's bet !
don't !
tell him you believe him !
i will not bet , but i can not believe .
are you aware how much are two kilometres? !
stop .
stop !
you rascals !
god damn you !
ok , ok , ok .
can you see anything?
no , i don't ... all right , i was kidding .
you will call my son a liar in front of all this people !
we liars? !
give me the head .
go on , misko , go on .
brother , don't !
please !
we all believe you !
and i believe , too !
don't panic , folks !
my misko is genius for driving .
tell him to stop !
look out , the pole !
and two years ago , again for bet , he drove half kilometre backwards !
backwards , what are you ta ...?
shut up man !
don't provoke !
you don't believe me? !
yes we believe !
yes , yes !
daddy , what is this? !
this was not here !
go back !
where? !
back !
back !
" back , back? ! " what shall we do now?
the road is closed , you must go around !
people , this army thing does not smell good .
what do you want now : should we go around or should we go back?
now to go back? !
we drive around for so long !
drive on , misko !
that's it misko .
bravo !
i am terribly thirsty .
can i have a little from that water?
this water is not for drinking .
i am dead thirsty .
want some brandy?
thanks , i can't , my stomach ...
ah , wait !
there is cure for that also , mister .
d i e beste?
die beste , die beste , the best !
german medicine is the best in the world !
seems you would be glad if they came , ha?
well , you know , at least we would know order , and discipline and who should do what !
that germans should all be
lined to the wall and executed !
all of them !
you have 100 years , and you speak nonsense !
what is this? !
daddy , look , he is ploughing the road !
ah crazy man !
you can't go further !
you can't go further !
how do you mean?
you can't fly over ploughing ; ploughing you must not cross .
heavens !
since the army has closed the main road , everybody go this way , across my land .
is it right? !
all right , old man , what should we do now?
pay me for crossing the ploughing .
eh , that's not going to be ...
come on , drive !
don't waste time !
drive on , misko !
old man , we must go on .
you can't !
only over my dead body !
let me down , i will call children !
let me down !
i will call ...
children , children !
children !
daddy !
stop shouting !
plerce , they don't want to pay !
don't , for god's sake , don't !
plerce !
plerce !
stop !
we will pay !
don't do it , please !
stop !
old man , how much we owe you?
100 dinars .
right away .
daddy , what is it?
it's this : people ask that we pay for crossing collect the money anyway you can .
how much?
200 dinars .
200 dinars !?
come on , from where?
for what? !
come on , give the money , or they will pierce all tyres .
quick !
they don't want to wait .
come on , come on .
i sympathize .
my children will carry the wagon .
come on , carry it !
come on , brothers , give a hand also !
why in god's name have you ploughed this road , ha?
for 10 years i am prosecuting the state to pay me for the road across my land .
and now , when i see that no one knows " who drinks and who pays " , i will take the justice in my hands and make up for my loss , or die !
god help you !
who are you escorting?
the teacher .
what happened , in god's name?
scoundrels ... they killed my uncle .
sons of jova stevic .
old man , here is yours 100 dinars .
wait , wait .
one , two , three , four , five .
all right?
all right !
drive !
everybody out !
what is it now?
we have paid , what more do you want !?
they killed the teacher and it would be right to escort him and meanwhile i will change the wheel .
come on , come on , quick , quick !
this hack will never make it to the graveyard .
i will miss the audition for singer in restaurant " lipov lad " the best restaurant in belgrade !
you sing?
really !?
i would be exceptionally glad if you heard me consider yourself invited .
i don't know ...
i will surely be admitted
i would sing only for you .
excuse me , please .
why did you hit the horse?
to make it hurry up !
see how slow it is !
excuse me , are you a journalist?
ah , no , no ...
i write down folk tales and unusual , rare words .
a ... my respects !
well ... someone has to take care about the riches of this people .
gun has fired from a stealth
our teacher has gone
it's spring of '41
it's spring , the evil comes
oh my mother
what is happening?
the sad song i must play
death is coming to see us
and no peace is here , no more .
i am unfortunate
since i was kid
with all my sorrow
i sing songs
i wish , oh my mother ,
that all this was only a dream .
... all what i have nice to tell you , my dear uncle ,
i have already told you before .
and , err ... , i should add nothing more .
generations and generations that you have brought to the right path , remember you eagerly and with pride .
err ... here , from this land , many of yours shepherds and shepherdesses have left to cities , to become honourable and respectful citizens , err ... , doctors , engineers , and ... lawyers .
they went to the woods ...
you know that i have always appreciated , respected and
listened to you .
but this time i will do what is most reasonable i will kill animals and beasts like rats !
i will not let any law judge them .
where is your father?
i didn't set off to the funeral , but hospital !
quiet , men .
easy !
we are not going to fight !
child knows nothing .
how aren't they ashamed?
from whom?
from us .
we came to look them ...?
doesn't matter ...
laws are meant for people , and they are beasts .
and beasts we must stop .
i want to promise you , in front of this people , that i will find the murderers , and that i will kill them .
i know what you would say " don't do that " ,
because you did everything you could against revenge .
you have lost your life trying to make peace among warring parties .
you wanted that people of this land
live in happiness , peace and understanding .
listen , where are the people from the bus?
they all went there , friend .
but why?
i don't know , friend .
come on !
daddy , i would do this !
daddy would also , my son !
die , you bastard !
shame on you !
stevic sons !
hold them there !
can i go with you to belgrade? !
come on , priest , quick !
folks , everybody to the right side of the bus !
left can not hold !
thank god !
we are alive !
yes !
and now we will huddle up together all the way to belgrade and this side is free !
can't you understand , man , that front left tyre is weak and that it will explode if we put too much weight on it? !
and we have no more reserve? !
that's your problem !
i paid to sit .
come on , find me a place .
please sit here !
not on you place !
you have shown who and what are you !
leave the girl alone !
she is not responsible for our lack of manners !
don't you dare to put me in the same line with you !
i am a sir for you !
all this is a consequence of a total lack of discipline and chaos !
honest people must feel shame !
you should cut your tongue down !
what !?
and you don't threaten anyone in my bus !
you shut up ; you are the same like him !
why do you allow that he insults your passengers?
let me see your tlckets , please !
what tickets?
ticket control !
where is your ticket?
i don't know ...
throw him out !
why do you ask for tickets now?
routine control every 50 km .
who has no ticket must buy new one and pay the fine or go on walking !
i can't find it ...
ask your colleges , musicians , maybe they have stolen it .
you , don't make insults !
i am hit singer .
good afternoon !
good afternoon !
friend , the bridge is broken , you must go back !
what do you mean , broken? !
few days ago the army has pulled the canons across .
it's weak now ; it will not hold the bus !
listen , friend , i have already left the main road because of the army , and i will not do it again , even if i have to fall in the river together with the bus !
then you go and die , if you want to !
what is it now again ! ... this can not hold , ha?
daddy , this is all rusty !
i fuck the one who made it so stupid !
hey , people , the bridge will fall down !
believe me !
it really looks poor .
if you ask me , i would drive the bus across .
it's not as bad as it looks !
run folks !
the bridge is falling down !
what are we going to do now? !
nothing .
nobody pushed him
nobody made him shake the fence .
we will only report the case .
as far as i know , people , all drowned persons appear at the surface at least two times : this one not once !
his pockets were full of rocks .
what left from such a man !
come on , people , departure !
daddy , look !
like man with no legs and arms !
take that rifle away !
don't worry , the gun is secured .
daddy , tyre !
excuse me , accident , it was empty !
out !
i didn't mean it ... !
out !
but really , i didn't mean it ... out !
and if i haven't pushed the barrel away , he would have blown my head apart !
god , are we going to get there alive? !
if from nothing else , i will die of hunger .
i'm hungry , too !
listen , first offer the worst meat , bones and so , and then the rest .
for god's sake , people , what is this? !
how much more are we going to stop and wait?
i must be in belgrade for audition at last at five !
barbarians !
this is outrageous !
could you explain us what we wait now?
half an hour break !
what for?
weren't you the first to claim hungry? !
and we two are hungry , too !
and rules allow us a break !
beware !
take the barrel off , misko !
it's ready !
hey , gipsies , take this .
play something , make the people feel good .
and if i sell all the meat and brandy you will get another 20 dinars .
fair?
fair , boss !
here is the meat !
don't cough on the meat !
you want to scare away all my customers? !
get lost !
come let us drink a brandy groom will pay .
i have no money .
eh , you are for nothing .
if i have married such a girl , i would offer the whole bus !
come , give us three brandies on me !
here it is !
have you ever been to the sea?
eh , my dear , where haven't i been ...
where is most beautiful?
it depends , bride , what do you want?
if i were him , i would take you to some little island , we would walk by the sea , sing songs ...
this one , yours , has only one thing in his mind?
what are you laughing at , ha? !
if it weren't for me , you wouldn't have seen the world !
you would die in that desert !
here is a bit for you to eat .
thanks , i have no appetite .
you know , father , since i have fallen sick , nobody loves me anymore .
everybody chase me away , avoid me ...
people are afraid of the sickness , you know? !
last year i felt very bad , i've been in coma , you will not believe me , but all this i've already seen and experienced : this bus , this people , this river ... everything !
there is no difference between this and other world !
everything is written in the holy bible ...
i know ...
i know what is written , there stands that a man should also
love his neighbour , but me nobody loves me !
you see what is happening in the world? !
yes , yes !
people kill each other everywhere , like beasts !
are you for a dance?
eh ...
i know only folks dance ...
just you lean on me , everything will be all right .
look at that rooster !
he will jump on the bride till the end !
yes , for sure .
bravo , bride !
we two could become partners !
it's too late , my brother , i've already made a partnership for whole life ...
listen , what do you need that kid for?
you need a serious man , who will
love you as a woman ...
where are you going with him?
life flies away quickly ...
till he gets stronger , your time will pass ...
if it doesn't fall at the right moment , it's like it didn't happen !
people , look !
there he is !
he is alive !
i could have drowned !
if i had fallen into the river , i would have drowned immediately !
those like me do not drown so easy .
this vampire always ruins everything .
get packed , misko , we should get going .
come in folks , we go now !
daddy !
daddy look , rabbit !
misko my son , i will catch it for you .
let me do it , i am faster and handier .
now he is finished for sure !
daddy , rabbit has escaped !
how come you are here?
i was shooting the rabbit !
i didn't mean it , believe me .

this man is undestroyable !
