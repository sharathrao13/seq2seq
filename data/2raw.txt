at the age of ten ,
l laid my hands on a copy of the legends of the great martyrs .
l read it with a revulsion bordering on voracious ecstasy .
they languished in dungeons , were roasted , pierced with arrows and were nailed to a cross .
all of this they underwent in a state of intoxication .
gregor ...

ls my bath ready?
gregor , hold me .
l don't think l'm in love with wanda .
but i can feel l'm falling under her spell .
this is no love , but physical enslavement .
don't stop !
i can't !
you enjoy it !
l live as i paint and write .
l progress no further than an intention , a plan , a first act a first line .
such people just happen to exist .
they start all kinds of things , but never finish anything .
l am someone like that , a dilettante .

l was twelve when a distant aunt , on my mother's side came to stay with us .
she was beautiful woman , with a mysterious smile .
but i hated her , because she was known as a femme fatale .
l behaved spitefully and was as antisocial as i could be .
my parents were away on a trip and i was alone with her .
l walked down the stairs and was about to leave , but she stood in front of me , dressed in a fabulous fur coat .
she grabbed me , before i could complain ,
l was lying on the marble floor bound hand and foot .
with an evil grin , she rolled up her sleeves and birched me until i screamed out in pain and begged for mercy .
she released me and i had to get down on my knees and thank her and kiss her hand .
a fierce passion was awakened in me she has been the most attractive woman in the whole world .
still alive?
you came to kill me?
are you unwell?
your cheeks are aglow .
do you love me?
i want you to love me !

especially since you have been suffering so much .

do you knowthe story of dionysus'ox?
it was an iron ox in which someone sentenced to death was placed .
the ox was then put in a huge fire . . the screaming and wailing of the tormented victim in the red hot iron sound like the mooing of an ox .
dionysus smiled nicely at the inventor and immediately had him placed in the iron ox to test his own invention .
you are the one who incited me to violence .
and you'll be the first victim .
i now enjoy having someone in my power and mistreating him .
