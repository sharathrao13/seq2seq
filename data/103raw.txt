miles !
you going to work all day?
i'm sorry , baby .
this thing is kicking my ass .
it's sunday .
you promised to take the kids to raging waters today .
i can't .
i'm on a roll .
this is gonna blow 'em away .
it's a neural net processor .
i know .
you told me .
it thinks and learns like we do .
it's superconducting at room temperature .
other computers are just pocket calculators by comparison .
why is that so important?
i need to know , 'cause sometimes i feel like
i'm going crazy here .
baby , i am this close .
come here .
imagine a jet airliner with a pilot that never gets tired , never makes mistakes , never shows up with a hangover .
meet the pilot .
why did we get married?
have children?
you don't need us .
your heart and your mind are in here .
but it doesn't love you like we do .
i'm sorry .
really .
how about spending some time with your other babies?
raging waters?
yeah !
wait in the car .
enrique?
you here?
pretty jumpy , connor .
what about you?
always on the lurk .
good to see you , connor .
i promised to make it back .
man , i knew it .
good to see you .
yolanda .
get out here , we got company .
and bring some tequila !
oye , big john?
que pasa?
what's up?
who's your friend?
he's cool .
he's with me .
he is uncle bob .
uncle bob , this is enrique .
uncle bob , huh?
okay .
how are you?
how are you?
you've gotten big .
drink?
uncle bob?
sarahlita , you pretty famous .
all over the tv .
pictures of you , john , your big friend here .
cops are going nuts looking for you .
take the kid , honey , will you?
i just came for my stuff .
i need clothes , food , and one of your trucks .
how about the fillings out of my fucking teeth?
now .
you two , you're on weapons detail .
come on , let's go .
one thing about my mom , she always plans ahead .
excellent .
nothing down here .
this is the best truck i got , but the starter is gone .
you got the time to change it out?
yeah .
i'm gonna wait till dark to cross the border .
enrique , it's dangerous for you here .
you get out tonight too , okay?
sure .
just drop by any time and totally fuck up my life .
see , i grew up in places like this , so i thought that's how people lived : riding around in helicopters ,
learning how to blow shit up .
but then , when my mom got busted , i got put in a regular school .
the other kids were into nintendo .
are you ever afraid?
no .
not even of dying?
no .
you don't feel any emotion about it one way or another?
no .
i have to stay functional until the mission is complete .
then it doesn't matter .
yeah .
i have to stay functional too .
i'm " too important " .
that's definitely you .
most of the guys my mom hung round with were geeks .
but there was this one guy .
he was kinda cool .
he taught me engines .
hold here .
mom screwed it up , of course .
she'd always tell them about judgment day and me being this world leader .
and that'll be all she wrote .
torque wrench , please .
here .
i wish i could've met my real dad .
you will .
yeah .
i guess .
when i'm , like , 45 , i think .
i'll send him back through time to 1984 .
he hasn't even been born yet .
it messes with your head .
the other bolt .
here .
mom and him were only together one night .
she still loves him , i guess .
i see her crying sometimes .
she denies it totally , of course .
like she got something stuck in her eye .
why do you cry?
you mean people?
yeah .
i don't know .
we just cry , you know .
when it hurts .
pain causes it?
no , it's different .
it's when there's nothing wrong but you hurt anyway .
you get it?
no .
alright !
my man !
no problemo .
gimme five .
put out your hand like this .
come on .
alright .
now hit me .
gimme five .
do the same thing .
alright !
okay , that's good .
up high , up high .
five low .
too slow .
just kidding .
one more time .
watching john with the machine , it was suddenly so clear .
the terminator would never stop , it would never leave him , never hurt him , never shout at him or get drunk and hit him , or say it was too busy to spend time with him .
it would always be there .
and it would die to protect him .
of all the would be fathers who came and went , this thing , this machine , was the only one who measured up .
in an insane world , it was the sanest choice .
she said you go south with him .
she'll meet you tomorrow .
mom !
mom !
wait !
no fate .
no fate but what we make .
my father told her this .
i mean , i made him memorize it , up in the future , as a message to her .
never mind .
the future is not set .
there is no fate but what we make for ourselves .
she intends to change the future .
yeah , i guess .
oh shit !
dyson .
yeah , gotta be !
miles dyson !
she's gonna blow him away !
come on !
let's go !
this is tactically dangerous .
drive faster .
the t 1000 has the same files that i do .
it knows what i know .
it might anticipate this move .
i don't care .
we've gotta stop her .
killing dyson might actually prevent the war .
i don't care !
haven't you learnt anything yet?
why you can't kill people?
look , maybe you don't care if you live or die .
but everybody's not like that !
we have feelings .
we hurt .
we're afraid .
you gotta learn this stuff .
i'm not kidding .
it's important .
danny , i told you to go to bed like your sister .
just a couple of minutes , mom .
danny , your time is up .
come brush your teeth and get to bed .
danny just go !
oh my god !
just take danny and go .
run !
oh jesus , miles .
nobody fucking move !
don't hurt my daddy !
get on the floor !
fucking down !
now !
get out of the way !
don't hurt him !
get on the floor !
fast !
just let the boy go .
shut up !
shut up !
it's all your fault !
it's all your fault !
what?
i'm not gonna let you do it .
shit , we're too late .
check them .
look at me , mom .
are you hurt?
look at me .
i almost ...
i almost ...
it'll by okay .
we'll figure something out , okay?
promise .
you came here to stop me?
yes , i did .
i love you , john .
i always have .
i know .
clean penetration .
no shattered bone .
hold here .
compression should stop the bleeding .
who are you?
show him .
danny , i want you to come with me .
show me your room .
oh , my god !
now listen to me very carefully .
dyson listened while the terminator laid it all down .
skynet , judgment day , the history of things to come .
it's not every day that you find out you're responsible for 3 billion deaths .
he took it pretty well .
i feel like i'm gonna throw up .
you're judging me on things i haven't even done yet .
how were we supposed to know?
yeah .
right .
how were you supposed to know?
fucking men like you built the hydrogen bomb .
men like you thought it up .
you think you're so creative .
you don't know what it's like to create something .
to create a life .
to feel it growing inside you .
all you know how to create is death and destruction .
mom !
we need to be a little more constructive here , okay?
we still have to stop this from happening .
but i thought ...
aren't we changing things?
changing the way it goes?
that's right !
there's no way i'm gonna finish the processor .
not now .
forget it .
i'm out of it .
i quit cyberdyne tomorrow .
not good enough .
no one must follow your work .
right , then ...
we have to destroy the stuff at the lab .
the files , drives ...
everything .
everything here .
everything !
i don't care .
do you know about the chip?
what chip?
in a vault at cyberdyne .
from the other one like you .
the cpu from the first terminator .
son of a bitch , i knew it !
they told us not to ask where they got it .
those lying motherfuckers !
it was radically advanced .
it was smashed , it didn't work .
but it gave us ideas , took us in new directions .
things we'd never ...
all my work is based on it .
it must be destroyed .
can you get us in , past security?
i think so , yeah .
when?
now?
the future , always so clear to me , had become like a black highway at night .
we were in uncharted territory now , making up history as we went along .
hi .
carl , right?
friends from outta town , thought i'd ... ... show them around .
you know the rules concerning visitors .
i need authorization ...
i insist .
don't even think about it .
takes 2 keys to open the vault , turned simultaneously .
the other one is at the security station .
gibbons .
come on , man , you can't leave the desk like that .
oh , shit .
my card should access this .
what is it?
dammit .
the silent alarm's been tripped .
it's neutralized all the codes in the building .
nothing'll open anywhere now .
we have to abort .
no .
we do it all the way !
okay?
you guys get started on the lab .
i can open this .
i think it's that guy from the mall .
it is the guy !
him and the woman .
just send everything you've got in the area .
i have a personal entry code for the lab that may still work .
it's no good .
let me try mine .
john !
fire in the hole !
wait !
you can't go in there !
the fire's set off the halo system !
you have to wait a few minutes , until the gas clears .
put this on .
alright , let's get to work .
a 211 in progress at 2144 kramer street , the cyberdyne building .
suspect 1 is white , female , identified as : last name connor , first name sarah , escaped from pescadero state hospital .
suspect 2 : white , male ...
all the disks in my office .
all the disks in that office over there .
everything behind my desk .
all the processors on my left .
we'll blow it up with the cp4 .
could i ...
excuse me ...
could i borrow that thing?
i worked a lot of years on this thing .
give me that location again .
2111 , kramer .
the suspects are armed and considered extremely dangerous .
alright , 7 2 5 6 .
yes !
easy money .
oh , shit .
not good .
not good .
how we doing?
primal cord is set .
one more barrel , two more minutes .
how do we set them off?
remote control .
piece of cake .

all of them , i think .

i'll finish here .
i'll take care of the police .
wait , you swore ...

hey you at the window , drop your weapon and place your hands on top of your head .
that's a damn mini gun !

come on , let's book !
hold your fire !
ready to rock?

he's coming up , to the right .

take the off ramp .
hold on !
don't stop !
go straight !

terminated .

yes .
throw it in .
adios .
and the chip .
it's over .
no .
there is one more chip .
and it must be destroyed also .

i can't self terminate .
you must lower me into the steel .

i order you not to go .
i know now why you cry .
but it's something i can never do .
goodbye .
the unknown future rolls toward us .
i face it for the first time with a sense of hope .
because if a machine , a terminator , can learn the value of human life , maybe we can too .
