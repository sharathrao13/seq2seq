same with you?
wow .
well , in my business , it's not a good thing .
what do you do?
what do i do?
i want to show you something .
i hold on to this .
a paper clip?
was that a paper clip?
it was .
i had to find something ... ... to draw the nervous energy away from my heart .
like a ....
like a lightning rod?
like a lightning rod .
exactly .
all the energy goes into the paper clip .
and then what's left is ....
your speech .
yeah , a smooth , and i'd like to think ... ... very compelling speech .
some of the best speakers in history ... ... a paper clip .
let me see , henry kissinger .
he wasn't known for his speaking abilities .
no , he wasn't , was he?
he would've really sucked .
he would've what?
really sucked .
right .
so maybe you'll try again?
hey , ma , can we go see the penguins?
let's go see penguins .
five minutes .
you're a bad influence .
i am?
hurry up !
look at this guy go .
they're so funny .
they look like little , fat , short guys with tuxedos .
speaking of fat guys in tuxedos , there's this thing monday night .
it's a black tie .
it's a $2500 a plate dinner .
oh , my god . $2500 per plate? $2500 a plate .
i hope you get to keep the plate .
you can if you want .
what is it for?
for the inner city literacy campaign , something i support .
it's a big benefit that maddox throws every year .
it's not quite as boring as it sounds .
i don't know , are you interested?
wait a minute . lsn't that the guy who hired yatter to get pictures of you?
yes , it is .
i don't get it .
why would you go?
i go because i go it's exposure .
won't everyone know you're there just to expose yourself?
well , i kind of have to expose myself .
when you put it that way  i didn't .
you put it that way .
i don't care how much you pay for dinner .
you shouldn't serve yourself up , no matter what the cause .
so why don't you tell me what you really think .
you really want me to tell you what i think?
lf mr. wanton maddox , or whatever his name is , really wants to help ... ... why doesn't he give the $2500 per plate to the inner city schools?
and eat a little bit lighter that night , you know?
so why don't you come with me and tell him yourself .
monday ... ... l'm busy .
sorry .
you're busy , you can't?
what?
can you change it?
it's complicated .
which reminds me , i gotta get out of here .
come on , we gotta go .
we gotta go .
we're gonna be late .
do we have to?
i gotta get back .
caroline .
this can't be it .
come on , we haven't seen the snakes .
except for yatter .
it was nice meeting you , chris marshall .
we're late .
we gotta go .
come on .
here , ty ....
don't use them all on one speech .
i won't .
keep up the good voting record .
i'll do my best .
it's complicated .
what kind of answer is that?
honest .
the only thing complicated between me and him would be my bra strap .
look , what am i supposed to do?
make his bed with me in it?
get real !
he thinks i'm a guest here .
all right .
all right .
but just tell me what he was like .
sexy eyes .
and nice lips .
what about the hands?
were they big?
they were perfect .
perfect works .
marisa !
who?
what?
marisa ventura , are you back there?
oh , my god , it's paula !
what are you doing?
i just ....
i spilled something on my apron ... ... so i was cleaning it , and she was helping me tie it .
mr. bextrum wants to see you in his office right now .
oh , shit !
look who's here .
let's review the last hour , okay?
delgado killed while you were out walking that goddamn dog .
you got a pen that works?
sure .
here you go .
anything else i can do for you?
no , that's good , thanks .
get this note to the woman in the park suite .
her name is caroline .
can you handle that for me?
certainly .
thank you .
who's caroline in the park suite?
someone i met .
you wanted me to have an escort ... ... for that maddox literacy thing on monday night .
but i was thinking more of a blind , ex illiterate senior citizen who learned ...
... to read while fighting nazis .
i thought your mother was in florida .
just make sure she's not married , on medication ... ... or a democrat .
did you check , or?
rufus .
sure , okay , great .
can i talk to you for a second?
i want you to find out who caroline is in the park suite .
don't write it down .
just remember it .
thanks .
good job .
come in , miss ventura .
i assume you know the reason you've been called here .
i think so .
yes , sir .
do you know what the foundation of a great hotel is?
location?
loyalty and trust .
would you say those are qualities that you possess?
i would .
yes , sir .
miss burns agrees .
and she's urged me to consider you .
we had no idea you were interested in management ... ... until miss kehoe brought us your application .
by the way , you forgot your social security number ... ... and your mother's maiden name .
lf you just fill them in and sign right there .
perfect .
normally , you'd go through the program and train for a year as a butler , but
given the circumstances  due to overbooking and understaffing ... ... we decided to accelerate your application .
and move you into management after the six week training .
with the proviso that you pass the practical exam ... ... and fulfill each requirement for every station .
so you see , miss ventura , sometimes ... ... when life shuts one door , it opens a window .
so jump .
steph , where are you?
i know you're in here .
don't tell me you're busted .
no , you are .
you know what?
you had no right !
what are you talking about?
you filled out an application for me?
they're considering you .
do you know what you've done?
i did you a favor .
no . lf you wanna do me a favor ... ... then mind your own business once in a while .
for two years , you've yapped about getting out of uniform ... ... and what ideas you got .
this morning , i'm having coffee with rosalie from personnel ... ... and i ask her .
i go , " marisa got a shot?
she goes , " marisa who?
i go , " marisa ventura .
she's applied .
she goes , " lf she applied , i'd slip it to the top of the pile .
so i just act real nonchalantlike and i go , " are you sure?
marisa ventura ain't never applied for no management program ever .
lmagine my shock and dismay .
my own partner , lying to me like that .
then i figured maybe you were too chickenshit , so i did it myself .
lf they took you , you'd be happy .
and if they didn't , you wouldn't know the difference .
so sue me !
these are the golden years .
we gotta prove our mothers wrong .
don't waste them .
what we did today was wrong .
but you didn't really lie .
not technically .
now you're starting to sound like nixon .
letting someone believe something's true when it's not ... ... is just as much a lie as a lie is .
i let him think i was staying in the suite , not cleaning it .
i'm the maid .
i hate to break it to you , but i don't think he's after your money .
i can't believe you just said that !
just get my keys in my pocket , please .
this is hot .
good job .
all right , sweetie .
behave yourself , okay?
thank you .
my pleasure .
can i borrow this?
of course .
thank you .
baby , bye .
and remember , all security lds ... ... will need to be rephotographed starting next week .
i think that's all .
thank you very much .
barbara , clarice , come with me , please .
have you seen this?
no .
what?
well , let me show you .
give me this .
yeah .
so?
what do you mean , " so "?
what if somebody from the hotel sees it?
i hate to break the bubble .
you can't tell it's you .
don't worry about it .
it's the front page of the paper today .
stop .
you do one spontaneous thing , you think you're going to hell .
do you understand this could be bad?
don't be such a catholic .
please .
come on .
good morning .
nice to see you .
can i steal him away for a second?
sure .
let me steal you away .
excuse me .
i want to talk to you .
what's the problem?
this !
do you know what this is gonna cost me?
an entire day of doing nothing but covering your ass .
i'm getting calls from the london times , the washington post ... ... the chicago sun , asking about her identity , her background ... ... who the kid is .
a kid !
just when i get them to focus on your assets , they're focusing on hers .
thanks .
yeah , well , they're fantastic assets , don't you think?
squeezing the circle tighter and tighter and tighter ... ... and release .
let's try that again .
and squeeze the circle tighter , tighter ...
... and relax .
sorry , i'll come back .
that's okay .
you can work around us .
we could use some more towels , por favor .
rapido .
squeezing the circle tighter ... ... and tighter and tighter .
radiating from the pelvis .
good .
breathe .
exhale .
are you all right?
twinkles , is it eric?
i knew it .
he hasn't called once .
not my cell , not the service , not the hotel .
so last night i called him , and rach , he was with ....
i can't .
it's like cheap wine .
shall we do some band work , ladies?
go on , i'm listening .
i heard her in the background .
the cheap wine?
his ex , in midlaugh .
butler service , miss lane .
i have a message from mr. christopher marshall .
christopher marshall?
as in , christopher marshall?
he's staying in the york suite and was wondering ... ... if you had a response to the luncheon invitation ... ... l placed in your room yesterday .
we're through .
thank you .
ln my room?
i have to charge the full hour .
yesterday .
fine .
for lunch?
for two .

where?
ln his suite .
this is a miracle .
shall i give him an answer?
yes .
tell him yes .
what time?
1 p . m .
she'll be there .
thank you .
when did this go down?
we met at this thing in southampton last summer .
i thought we had a moment .
can you steal away an hour , please?
you think he saw you in the hall?
who cares?
what should i wear?
you look good in anything .
but i didn't bring a thing !
let's see .
maria , thank goodness .
i need a favor .
it's urgent .
could you get those outfits you returned for me yesterday?
there's this divine dolce cashmere coat .
it's just
actually , they're still in the closet .
i thought you might want a second look .
you are so good .
thank god !
you should be a personal assistant .
she's a maid .
so are they , with better titles .
actually , i'm up for a position .
what do you think?
dolce coat , gucci pants ... ... or ralph lauren skirt , manolo pumps?
they're both divine !
let's see .
how about the pants , open sandals , see through blouse ... ... colored bra and carry the dolce coat for effect .
maria?
she barely speaks english .
what?
excuse me?
maria , what do you think?
what about the beaded skirt with that beige ... ... crocheted halter you have in the closet?
you know , casual sexy .
no stockings .
definitely eighty six the coat .
it sends the wrong message .
like you're going someplace .
besides , that whole see through blouse , colored bra thing ... ... reads a little desperate , older gal , trying too hard .
don't you think?
you want to make him work for it .
who does she think she is to talk to me like that?
thank you , maria .
eric who?
excuse me .
sorry .
yes , that's it .
all handles parallel with the right elbow .
review your protocols for table setting and wine service .

and there's only one thing could make me shut my mouth .
you dirty old man .
you're in trouble .

about the silver soap dishes ....
rach , darling , i'll just be a sec .

i called about a ticket to the  benefit .
monday night .
we were able to procure you a single at a table adjacent to mr. marshall's .
fantastic !
and how much will that be?
three thousand dollars .

the rates are raised when a couple is split .
singles are always harder to place .

i think she's very attractive .
i had her checked out .
she comes from a family with money ... ... politically neutral and has no naked pictures .
that woman wasn't the woman i wanted .
i don't know what to say .
i talked to the hotel manager .

lnteresting .
yeah , we think so .
shall we?
okay?
bye .
what are you not saying?
nothing .
tell me .
maybe you should spend real time in the projects ... ... and then you wouldn't have to make up speeches and memorize them .
you know , it would be coming from someplace real .
and how would you know?
i mean ....
because i grew up there .
i lived in a four block radius my whole life .
bye .
okay , let's go .
come on .
chris !
what?
shall we?
okay?
let's go .
gotta go .

i'll tell you who she isn't .
she isn't like anyone i've met .
and she isn't a phony .

are you truly interested in management?
yes , very much , sir .
then i suggest that you go to the met tonight ... ... and end all association with chris marshall .

i'll make sure your shift is covered .
mari .

you can still be a manager , right?
yeah , if i break it off with chris .
break what off?
no offense , sweetheart .
what planet are you on?
you don't get it .
none of you .
there was something different about him .

i mean , do you think that's too obvious?
no .
a harry winston wreath?

i mean , where would a maid get that necklace?
i thought maybe

let's just can we just go forward?
wait !

excuse me , sir .
mr. bextrum wants to see both of you in the park suite .
lionel .
marisa .
oh .
well , that's interesting .
she told me her name was maria .
i thought it would be impolite to correct you .
and i suppose you think it's polite to steal people's clothes?
i didn't steal  miss ventura , mr. bextrum has spent ... ... 30 minutes trying to persuade miss lane not to press charges .
i suggest you say as little as possible .
we have it all on video .
was everything returned?
yes , sir .
oh , chris , i'm terribly sorry ... ... to interrupt you .
we thought you should know what was going on .
what is going on?

aren't you , marisa?
no .

no , chris , darling , that's my name .
she steals clothes , identities

why are you dressed that way?
caroline?
ls this true?

there's no reason to involve the press .
how will you prevent her from speaking?
this would never happen at the four seasons .
i can assure you it has never happened here before either .
lionel , you are slipping .
you should've noticed something .
i am disappointed .
please , mr. bextrum , he had nothing to do with this .
of course , sir .
i understand .
we'll talk about this later .
miss ventura , you no longer work here .
go to security , hand in your passes ... ... and you'll be escorted from the building .
yes , sir .
ls that really necessary?
chris , let the man do his job , okay?
oh , chris .
oh , chris .
i can't help but feel that this is partly my fault .
it isn't .
spare yourself .
at least let me buy you lunch .
after all , we've only got each other to get through this humiliation .
caroline , the first lunch was a mistake .
a second would be complete torture .
drinks , then?
i need your nametag , passkey and your ld card .
sorry , marisa , but i have to .
i understand .
god , don't tell me they fired you over this too .
no .
actually , i made a decision a moment ago .
it was long overdue .
you quit?
sometimes ... ... we're forced in directions that we ought to have found for ourselves .
thank you .
thanks , keef .
bye .
to serve people ... ... takes dignity and intelligence .
but remember , they're only people with money .
and although we serve them , we are not their servants .
what we do , miss ventura , does not define who we are .
what defines us is how well we rise after falling .
i think you'll make a wonderful manager someday .
and it's been my great honor to have worked with you .
marisa?
marisa !
caroline !
marisa !
i don't know which name to use .
marisa .
i don't get it .
what just happened?
what don't you get?
i'm the maid .
what was all this , some kind of bet?
a little game of what , get the guests?
i was trying on her clothes , and you were there ... ... and you invited me out , and everything
and you thought you had to lie to keep me interested?
who's kidding who here?
think you would've looked at me if you knew i was the maid?
well ....
come on .
with respect for your big hearted politics ...
... l don't think so , mr. assemblyman .
you didn't give me a chance .
you stand on your soapbox , judging everyone , so sure they're judging you .
and you think they're not?
come on .
half the time , i'm a stereotype they make fun of .
the other half of the time , i'm invisible .
maybe that's the point .
the first time you saw me , i was cleaning your bathroom , only you didn't see me .
was i supposed to introduce myself while taking a leak?
you can't nail me for that .
what are you doing?
not now , jerry .
just
go .
you might as well sell tickets .
i don't care .
you care .
no .
no .
no .
no .
marisa .
i just want the truth .
all right , you want the truth?
there was a part of me that wanted to see what it felt like ... ... to have someone like you look at me the way you did , just once .
and i'm sorry .
truly .
lf i could rewind the past week , i would .
was any of it real?
yeah , it was real .
it was so real it made me wonder how i was ever gonna give you up .
but i had to give you up .
that was the plan .
and then ....
last night ... ... l couldn't .
rosalie from personnel called .
we expected you hours ago .
hi , baby .
she told me what happened .
hey , ma .
you okay?
scoot over , let me see your homework .
i don't know what to say .
what are we gonna do for dinner?
you hungry , sweetie?
will you look at me?
no .
i'm gonna take a bath .
don't , mom .
what were you thinking , going out with someone like that?
someone like what?
chris marshall .
you had to pretend to be somebody so he'd go out with you?
where is your pride , marisa?
people like you make people like him a god .
why , because he's rich?
white?
he has things we don't have ... ... that we don't want to dream about?
it must really burn you that i think i have the right to go out with him .
you don't .
ty , go to your room and finish your homework , please .
what happened to you?
don't speak to me like that .
i am not the one who lost her job today .
no , i did .
i messed up .
okay?
it's all my fault .
you know what?
it's all right .
i'll be fine .
you will because we'll call seora rodriguez .
she owes me a favor .
she has  i'm not calling mrs. rodriguez .
i love you , okay?
i do .
but i don't want to clean houses .
there's nowhere to go from there .
hasn't this taught you anything?
wake up , little girl , you have responsibilities .
and they come every month like clockwork .
you want to end up back in the projects?
keep dreaming dreams that will never happen .
you want to put food on the table?
call seora rodriguez .
you're right , ma .
i'm a good cleaning lady .
i'll start over .
but not with mrs. rodriguez .
i'm gonna find a job as a maid in some hotel .
after some time passes , i'm gonna apply for the management program .
and when i get the chance to be a manager ....
and i will , ma .
i know i will .
i'm going to take that chance without any fear .
without your voice in my head telling me that i can't .
did you see this?
how did it start?
did he know you were a maid?
are you a beresford perk?
how long were you involved?
how did they find you out?
any advice to other maids looking to trade up?
did democrats put you up to this?
does he tip well?
ls it true you're booked on larry king live?
i'm at the beresford hotel , where yesterday ... ... senate hopeful chris marshall was captured on video in a lovers 'spat ... ... with a woman now identified as a hotel maid .
who's kidding who here?
think you would've looked at me if you knew i was the maid?
with respect  oh , shit .
oh , my god .
we won't we will not be answering
we will not be taking any questions right now .
mr. marshall will make a statement .
morning .
i'd like to make a short statement .
and it will be all that i have to say about this ....
this invasion of my privacy .
i happened to meet miss ventura and her son ... ... during my stay at a hotel in new york .
and we became friends .
there are people from all walks of life who i count as friends .
and my only regret in this instance is that one of them , miss ventura ... ... was subjected to the scrutiny and innuendo of the media ... ... as a result of that friendship with me .
i need these numbers to be plus 1 0 percent .
welcome to the employee cafeteria .
it's open 2 4 hours a day ....
please .
ls today the 1 9th?
six more shopping days .
he's here .
he's back !
who?
what are you reading?
yesterday's paper .
chris is in town .
so?
go put your clothes on .
it's late .
so?
he's giving a press conference .
guess where?
i don't care .
okay?
come on .
put your turtleneck on too .
it's cold .
at your hotel .
ma !
what?
at your hotel !
i heard you , bubba !
don't you think it's weird?
you'll be there , he'll be there .
so will a thousand other people .
we talked about this .
you have your turtleneck on backwards .
i thought we talked about this .
i know , but it's like fate .
no , it's like new york city and an available conference room .
you knew , didn't you?
you weren't gonna tell me .
you knew he was coming .
remember , bubba , what i told you?
we talked about this .
he's not part of our lives , but we wish him luck with his , right?
you think he misses us?
well , he'd be crazy not to .
mr. marshall , if elected , you'll be the third marshall ... ... to serve new york in the senate .
how does it feel?
lf i get elected , i'll let you know .
did your father leave you any advice?
yeah , he said , " don't run .
we have time for one more question , folks .
then we have a meet and greet in the green room .
i have a question .
what?
who said that?
mr. marshall , down here .
sure .
what's your question?
i was wondering ....
chris , don't do this .
no .
wait .
i'm listening .
go ahead .
well ....
i know everyone makes mistakes .
and it's a sign of character to give a person a second chance , right?
right .
i'm with you .
even if someone lied , they should be forgiven .
otherwise , we'd never have any congressmen or presidents .
thanks very much .
we have to wrap this up .
jerry , he's not done .
go on .
well , what if you're not a politician trying to do good for everybody?
what if you're just a regular person , like a maid or something?
and she made a mistake .
do you think she should get a second chance?
i mean , nobody's perfect , right?
no .
nobody's perfect .
ladies and gentlemen of the press , take a look at a future candidate .
all right , thanks very much , folks .
we'll see you all in buffalo .
don't do this .
don't throw it all  i'm just trusting my instincts here .
great speech .
really?
eating out of your hands .
thanks .
cool .
where is she?
this way !
have you seen marisa ventura?
no , i haven't seen marisa .
we haven't had this kind of story in a while .
it will kill his career .
will this hurt your announcement for senator?
mr. marshall , are you still seeing her?
was it love at first sight , mr. marshall?
marisa?
hey , ma .
marisa?
hey , ma .
