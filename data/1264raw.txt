honey
hey , you can't kick that ...
jeez .
you haven't changed one bit .
it's you , boeun .
you're a big girl now .
great body !
nice curves .
drop it , okay?
hey , you little girl !
hey , give me a break !
they look so nice and shiny ...
stop staring .
you'll sprain your eyes .
no , it's just that they look familiar .
anyway , what brings you here?
missed me so that you had to skip school?
no , it's the school's anniversary .
i was forced to come here .
i'm wasting my time when i really have to study .
yeah , there's only 2 years left to the national exam .
but people like you really make college look undesirable .
what do you mean?
you're a pervert and a playboy .
i may be a playboy , but not a pervert .
here's your present .
just for you , keep it a secret to the family .
okay .
pretty , isn't it?
it's padded .
real thick .
you're a pervert !
should i help you put it on?
should i?
want me to punch you?
my son !
my son's home !
how have you been?
welcome home .
thanks .
how was your trip?
fine .
how have you been?
grandfather's waiting .
hurry .
okay .
mom , it's heavy .
i'll carry it .
okay .
you've changed .
what was all the rush?
and is grandpa really sick?
son , brace yourself , okay?
delicious , isn't it?
i made it myself , just for you , grandfather .
really tasty .
no one but you can take such good care of me .
of course , i'm your only granddaughter .
you've really grown .
now you look like a lady .
she may have grown , but she's still a child .
i'd be married in the old days .
right grandfather?
absolutely .
a married woman .
sangmin , come sit here .
yes , grandfather .
you two , hear me out .
you may have heard this story before ,
sangmin's grandfather was an old friend and war comrade
when we were young , we made a pact .
to marry our kids .
but you two had only sons .
so , our pact was passed down to the next generation .
i hope you two can keep this promise .
what are you saying?
you idiot !
grandpa wants you to marry sangmin !
marriage?
you must be joking grandpa !
marry sangmin?
hey !
your grandpa's not kidding !
i can die peacefully after you two get married !
this way i can face sangmin's grandpa .
how can a high schooler get married !
anyone over 15 can marry with their parent's consent .
i haven't much time left , you know?
no , i won't .
never !
sorry grandpa but i'll forget what you just said .
he hasn't finished speaking !
i'm speechless myself .
it's me .
i'm back .
i'm back in korea , standing in front of the dept .
office .
hey , there's new blood in the dept .
how are you?
oh , yeah .
the chicks are great !
let's get together after class .
hey , sangmin !
what a surprise !
has it been a year already?
no , family business .
how about you?
great .
my looks ...
keep me too busy ...
come on ...
come back when i'm the ta .
it'll help when you skip classes .
would i , a model student , do that?
besides , it's my last year ...
friend , my good friend !
how have you been !
great dude !
look at him !
life in the west has done you well !
what brought you back?
problems at home?
yeah something's up at home ...
huh?
what?
i'm getting married ... damn .
huh?
bastard !
hey , is it a black or white girl?
pounding !
only you should know about it
i'm just 17
come , come silently
here and there
hey !
they're making such a fuss .
losers ...
shh !
they'll hear you .
why?
you think you're different?
my doctor said i have 20 more years to go !
really?
change of plans .
i'll make my move .
just back me up .
i understand .
good !
they switched it .
isn't he the guy?
they switched it .
remember?
yeah ...
i really wish they wouldn't play those things on tv .
i guess the wedding's really on .
what am i going to do , mom?
be strong , son .
grant your grandpa this one wish .
let's call it a day !
you're suh boeun , 1st grade , right?
you were so funny , don't you agree?
hey , what?
come on !
who's he?
he's just a guy i know .
that's what they all say .
i'm telling the truth !
i really thought about it , and i'll speak first .
let's just do it .
are you crazy?
i'm kidding .
you think i'd want to?
i don't want to do it with you !
even if i did , it's insane .
i'm just 15 !
okay , i got it .
anyway , i'll buy you dinner .
or anything else you need .
mister , you're a sugardaddy , aren't you?
boeun .
huh?
how can you do this to me?
i may be pretty , but into something like this .
hey ...
hyewon , stop it !
i'll leave you two to talk .
huh?
see you later , boeun .
remember , it's a secret .
i know .
bye .
good bye .
what's her problem?
it's understandable .
hello?
yes ...
what !
good , good .
grandpa !
grandpa !
grandpa !
grandpa , we're here !
grandpa , grandpa !
grandpa , grandpa !
wake up , grandpa !
uncle , something's wrong !
what?
grandpa !
it's doing it again .
we should've gone to another hospital !
it almost gave me a heart attack !
i was out of myself again .
are you okay , grandpa?
let's have a word outside .
okay .
be by your grandpa's side , okay?
yeah .
i'm really worried .
i know .
with the kids like that , he's getting worse .
come on ... marriage is out of the question !
they ... you have to think about boeun's future .
come on , let's just marry the kids .
let go .
come on ...
this is sangmin's grandparents .
soon after this picture was taken , war broke .
want me to tell you a secret?
secretly , your grandpa had feelings for sangmin's grandma .
she was quite a beauty .
however , after sangmin's grandpa's death ,
i tucked those feelings away .
that's why i took care of sangmin's father like my own son .
your father may not have been so happy about this .
boeun !
yes?
keeping this promise is the most important thing for me .
grandpa !
grandpa !
grandpa , wake up .
grandpa !
you can't die !
open your eyes , grandpa !
grandpa , i'll get married so open your eyes , grandpa !
i'll keep your promise , grandpa !
i'll get married ...
are you crying?
stop crying .
you may be behind in your grades , but you're the nation's first to get married .
congrats , missus .
right .
scared that sangmin will discover your lop sided butt?
a butt that needs cushioning to keep it on balance?
hey , get out !
ouch , it hurts !
i'm sorry boeun , for not being much help .
mom , am i really getting married?
what about school?
i have to go to college ...
marriage won't change anything .
marriage , accept it with grace .
it's nothing .
just consider you're getting a new brother .
i'm scared that they'll find out at school .
how will i face everyone?
don't worry .
grandpa will take care of it .
your grandpa was your principal's military senior .
really?
behold the face of a wolf who'll eat up a 15 year old virgin .
is it satisfaction or disbelief?
satisfaction , of course .
shit , are you really my friends?
i can't be married at this age .
to sangmin !
cheers
the chicks here are hot !
let's go out on the floor !
hello .
you're here .
thanks .
you're here .
sir !!
yes , come in .
over here .
i won't forget this .
how could our field trip be at the same time?
i know .
you shouldn't keep it from your other friends .
if they found out , the whole school will know .
then i'd have to quit school .
anyway , you're so pretty today .
i wish i could get married too .
look here !
hey , smile !
how are you doing?
hello .
don't take my picture .
okay , okay .
good luck !
i'm convinced that grandpa scammed me .
boeun , it's just a wedding , okay?
i can't do it , mom !
now , don't be a baby .
i'm nervous myself .
i'm telling grandpa .
i can't do it !
do you want your wedding turned into a funeral?
i don't know .
i'm scared , mom .
what am i going to do with such a baby?
now the groom will enter .
welcome him with a big applause .
the groom , please enter !
she's so beautiful !
respectable guests , family and relatives .
we are all gathered here to congratulate the new beginning of groom , park sangmin and bride , suh boeun ...
dad , we'll be okay .
yeah , yeah .
remember , she's only 15 .
what's your point?
i know i can trust you .
you forced me into this marriage , so i'll do as i wish !
boeun is still in high school !
i don't care !
i'll do as i wish with my wife .
boeun , don't worry .
your father in law has had a word with sangmin .
about what?
that you ... shouldn't do it ...
what?
i can't say ...
call us when you get there .
yes , auntie .
stop calling her that .
it's mom from now on .
yes , mom .
hey , mom !

it was so pretty ...

i don't believe this .

sorry .
hey !
did they arrive safely?
yeah ... they did .
i need to be clear about one thing .
listen .
until boeun graduates from college , no grandchildren !
make this clear to your father as well .
yes , of course .
when she was little , she would fall and break things , but she seemed to hold herself well at the wedding .
it's a relief .
why?
are you disappointed that she didn't fall?
yes , a little .
come on ...
not those idiots again !
having fun?
hey !
hey , do you have a place to stay?
just this once .
press anything .
wind it and press .

he's cute .
see you later !
hey , stop it .

hey !
come back !
feels good , doesn't it?
it's been a while ... together .
sit here .
stop .
rest your back on this .
i feel great .
it's too late for this but i'm sure that we did a horrible thing to boeun .
she's only 15 , and going through her 1st year of high school .
come on !
be more positive .
you were considering him as your son in law anyway .
she's not going far away .
let's have some faith , okay?
besides , our in laws love boeun like their own daughter .
but , she's not their own daughter .
i can understand dad and you , but i still can't forgive you for it .
okay , okay , that's enough ... enough ...
without boeun , it seems like there's a big hole in my heart .
everyone looks like boeun , that one too ...
candy , sir?
thank you .
candy , sir?
boeun , help him .
honey , honey , here .
thank you very much .

i'm glad you had fun .
since you're officially married ,
love one another so we can see the fruit of your love .
but you don't look so happy , sangmin .

i missed your cooking , it's delicious .
you shouldn't say that , your wife's right here .
you'll hurt boeun's feelings .
mom , don't worry .
i'm undernourished .
when boeun reaches twenty , you'll totally forget mom's cooking .
boeun , i've put food in the fridge , don't forget , okay?

we'll see about that ...
i've seen enough ...
whatever ...
the hag has appeared .
to find fault in our wall painting .
miss kim ,
miss kim , with her nasty tone , she will ...
i hate to admit it , but we've done a horrible job .
it's okay .
really?
let's wash our hands and grab some snacks .
are you taking care of sangmin's meals?
it's really hard to be an intern you know .
it couldn't be that hard !
hey , but he's your husband .
hey , i'm busy myself .
and he'll never skip a meal .
what kind of wife are you?
then you be his wife .
mrs. park sangmin .
forget it .
i don't want it .
why the sudden interest !
shut up .
hey , park sangmin !
where are you?
shouldn't you be helping me?
i couldn't believe it myself !
coke .
thanks .
good?
yeah .
eat up .
we'll be painting until dawn .
what?
hey , isn't she a babe?
she's the queen of sunil girls 'middle school .
hey , let me see .
hey !
i'm going to make a move on her , so nice shots , please .
okay .
just don't get blown off .
from this day on , she's suh dongku's woman !
excuse me , but , aren't you going to sunil girls 'middle school?
hey !
over there .
isn't that dongku's sister?
where?
it really is his sister .
her husband looked older than that ...
then , who's that?
she must've fallen for a younger dude .
nice .
the whole family's fooling around !
i got her number .
did you get a good shot?
here .
come to the monthly famlly dlnner before it's too late .
jungwoo , i have to go home .
already?
hurry in and sit .
can't you be more early?
leave her alone .
it's okay .
let's eat .
the chilli squid was great ...
attention , please .
i'll now show you my girlfriend !
do you have a girlfriend?
yes , of course .
now take a good look .
that's her?
she's better than your sister .
hey , look ... look ...
who's that?
huh?
hey , boeun !
hey !
boeun !
when you were little ,
i always pushed you on this swing here .
you really loved it .
but one day , you fell off the swing while i was pushing .
i actually did it on purpose .
i'm sorry , sangmin ...
everyone will be worried .
let's go .
this marriage ... it seems like your grandpa forced you into it , but in fact we wanted to have sangmin as our son in law .
do you remember?
how often you would cry?
but whenever sangmin came , a smile would spread on your face .
you would fall all the time .
scraping and breaking yourself .
sangmin felt worse than i did .
he carried you on his back all the time , that sangmin .
anyway , i envy you .
the way he spends more time on your school festival than his graduation exhibition ,
i guess he's gone to paint the wall with yongju and youngchul ...
sangmin !
sangmin !
sangmin !
i came with the family to see you , but an emergency at your squad forces me to turn away .
are you doing well?
a few days ago , heavy snow came down in seoul .
the han river is frozen as well ...
it's colder here , right?
don't catch cold .
and this is a secret but my mom says that i've become a woman now .
i'm a bit behind than the other girls , but being an idiot that you are , you won't understand what i mean , will you?
it's strange but when you were around , i hated your guts , but your absence has me missing you .
are you feeling the same?
then be good to me from now on .
stupid .
the disappointment of not being able to meet you has your mom crying .
anyway , this letter , i hope it reaches you .
where have you been?
i've been looking all over for you .
the wall's great .
i ... have something to say .
yeah , what?
i'm sorry .
i've been so selfish .
to you and ...
what's got into you?
i'm breaking up with you .
i'm sorry , jungwoo .
people laugh and dance but i hate to laugh
while we drink and search for love , we forget about the truth
why are you late?
did you see him?
who?
your husband or boyfriend?
i'm not kidding !
there he is .
i like the smiling clown yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah
i like the clown who embraces sadness
aren't they great?
now , intern , park sangmin will share a few words with us .
i thank everyone , the principal , all the teachers ... and all the students for helping me finish this internship in one piece .
it may have been a short time , but personally , it has left me with precious memories i will carry for the rest of my life .
mr. intern , cut the boring crap and show us some honestly .
mr. park sangmin is a married man .
didn't you know?
of course , it's not a sin to be married .
but in fact you're married to a 15 year old high school girl , right?
to suh boeun who's sitting right there ...
correct .
we are married .
but boeun had no choice .
the only crime she's committed was granting her sick grandfather's last wish .
it was against her will to marry me .
she may be married , but she's still a 15 year old high school girl .
she goes crazy over a bowl of chilli and spaghetti .
she loves cute stars and kimbap loving attractive baseball players .
everyday , she's stressed over exams , and applying to university .
i hope you won't persecute boeun's school life over a marriage document .
i beg you all .
sangmin , i'm not a kid anymore .
since i was little , you were always at my side .
i was never aware of the strange feelings ... inside ... but ...
i think i'm in love with you ...
our poor dongku .
she's the end of all your fun and play .
fun and play ...
i knew it since he was fixed on that school queen or whatever ...
i can't believe grandpa fell for her grandmother .
i can't believe it ...
she looks bright though .
just consider it starting early !
do it !
do it !
oh , shut up and peel the garlic .
i'm in no position to say this , but you can hide a lop sided butt , but not lop sized balls .
anyway , congrats .
it's good that she doesn't have a clue .
who would marry a lop sized ball man if they knew , right?
right .
oh , you're here !
oh , dad !
you're here .
i'm really getting into peeling these things ...
did you get married to peel garlic?
mom !
okay !
say cheese .
one , two , three !!
