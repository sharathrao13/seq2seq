i swore i was done hunting .
i can't do this alone .
no !
we got work to do .
this is dad's single most valuable possession
everything he knows about every evil thing is in here .
i think he wants us to pick up where he left off
you know , saving people , hunting things , family business .
no .
i got to find jessica's killer .
it's the only thing i can think about .
sam , you know we're gonna find dad , right?
yeah .
i know .
okay , your turn .
truth or dare?
truth .
do you want to make out with benji swartz?
dare .
okay , lame .
you have to ... say " bloody mary " in the bathroom .
is that the best you can come up with?
who's bloody mary?
she's this witch .
i heard she was a lady killed in a car crash .
it doesn't matter who she is .
if you say her name three times in the bathroom mirror , she appears ... and scratches your eyes out !
so why would anyone say it?
because it isn't real .
no turning on the lights .
and remember , three times .
bloody mary .
this is so stupid .
bloody mary .
bloody mary .
scared you .
you guys are jerks .
lily?
you mind keeping it down?
sorry , daddy .
sorry , mr .
shoemaker .
you so like him !
hey , geek .
you guys having fun?
you're out past curfew .
thanks , dad .
why sam?
no !
why sam?
sam , wake up .
i take it i was having a nightmare?
yeah , another one .
hey , at least i got some sleep .
hey , you know , sooner or later , we're gonna talk about this .
are we here?
yep .
welcome to toledo , ohio .
so , what do you think really happened to this guy?
so what we're gonna find out .
let's go .
hey .
hey .
can i help you?
yeah , we're the ... med students .
sorry?
oh , doctor ...
fliglavitch didn't tell you?
we talked to him on the phone .
we're from ohio state .
he's supposed to show us the shoemaker corpse .
it's for our paper .
well , i'm sorry , he's at lunch .
oh .
well , he said , uh oh , well , you know , it doesn't matter .
you don't mind showing us the body , do you?
sorry , i can't .
doc will be back in an hour .
you can wait for him , if you want .
an hour?
we got to be heading back to columbus .
yeah .
look man , this paper's half our grade ,
so if you don't mind helping us out?
look , man
no .
i'm gonna hit him in his face , i swear .
follow me .
dude , i earned that money .
you won it in a poker game .
yeah .
the newspaper said his daughter found him .
she said his eyes were bleeding .
more than that .
they practically liquefied .
any sign of a struggle , maybe somebody did it to him?
nope .
besides the daughter , he was all alone .
what's the official causeof death?
doc's not sure .
he's thinking massive stroke , maybe an aneurysm .
something burst up in there , that's for sure .
what do you mean?
intense cerebral bleeding .
this guy had more blooding his skull than anyone i've ever seen .
but the eyes?
what would cause something like that?
capillaries can burst .
see a lot of bloodshot eyes with stroke victims .
yeah , you ever see exploding eyeballs?
that's a first for me .
but , hey , i'm not the doctor .
think we could take a look atthat police report?
you know , for our paper?
i'm not really supposed to show you
might not be one of ours .
might just be some freak medical thing .
how many times in dad's long and varied career has it actually been a freak medical thing and not some sign of an awful supernatural death?
uh , almost never .
exactly .
all right .
let's go talk to the daughter .
feel like we're underdressed .
you must be donna, right?
yeah .
hi , uh ...
we're really sorry .
thank you .
i'm sam . this is dean .
we worked with your dad .
you did?
yeah . this whole thing
i mean , a stroke .
i don't think she really wants to talk about this right now .
it's okay , i'm okay .
were there ever any symptoms?
dizziness , migraines?
no .
that's because it wasn't a stroke .
lily , don't say that .
what?
i'm sorry , she's just upset .
no , it happened because of me .
sweetie , it didn't .
lily , why would you saysomething like that?
right before he died, i said it .
you said what?
bloody mary , three times in the bathroom mirror .
she took his eyes , that's what she does .
that's not why dad died . this isn't your fault .
i think your sister's right, lily .
there's no way it could have been bloody mary .
your dad didn't say it, did he?
no , i don't think so .
sam : the bloody mary legend dad ever find any evidence that it was a real thing?
not that i know of .
i mean , everywhere else , all over the country , kids will play bloody mary .
and as far as we know , nobody dies from it .
hey well , maybe everywhere it's just a story , but here it's actually happening .
the place where the legend began?
but according to the legend , the person who says ...
the person who says you know what gets it
but here ...
shoemaker gets it instead, yeah .
right .
never heard anything like that before .
still , the guy did die right in front of the mirror .
and the daughter's right .
the way the legend goes ,
you know who " scratches your eyes out .
it's worth checking into .
what are you doingup here?
we ... we had to go to the bathroom .
who are you?
like we said downstairs , we worked with donna's dad .
he was a day trader or something , he worked by himself .
no , i know , i meant ... and those weird questions downstairs , what was that?
so you tell me what's going on or i start screaming .
all right , all right .
we think something happened to donna's dad .
yeah , a stroke .
that's not the sign of a typical stroke .
we think it might be something else .
like what?
honestly , we don't know yet .
but we don't want it to happen to anyone else .
that's the truth .
so , if you're gonna scream , go right ahead .
who are you , cops?
something like that .
i'll tell you what .
here .
if you think of anything , you or your friends notice anything strange , out of the ordinary , just give us a call .
all right , say bloody mary really is haunting this town .
there's gonna be some sort of proof a local woman who died nasty .
yeah , but a legend this wide spread , it's hard .
i mean , there's like 50 versions of who she actually is .
one story says she's a witch , another says she's a mutilated bride .
there's a lot more .
what are we supposed to be looking for?
every version's got thingsin common .
it's always a woman named mary , and she always dies in front of a mirror .
so we've got to search local newspapers public records as far back as they go , see if we can find a mary who fits the bill .
well , that sounds annoying .
no , it won't be so bad , as long as we ...
i take it back .
this will be very annoying .
i'm not sure .
they were cops or detectives or something .
whoever they were , they were cute .
jill .
you didn't think so?
yeah , okay, they were cute .
but , still, do you think something could have happenedto donna's dad?
maybe lily was right .
maybe bloody mary got him .
very funny .
wait , i'm sorry .
was that fear i hear in your voice?
no .
charlie ...
i'm walking to the bathroom mirror right now .
jill , quit it .
oh , no ,
i can't help myself .
i'm gonna say it .
bloody mary .
bloody mary .
bloody mary .
jill?
jill !
you're such a freak .
i'll call you tomorrow .
you did it .
you killed that boy .
why sam?
why'd you let me fall asleep?
'cause i'm an awesome brother .
so , what did you dream about?
lollipops and candy canes .
yeah , sure .
you find anything?
oh , besides a whole new level of frustration?
no .
i've looked at everything .
a few local women , a laura and a catherine , committed suicide in front of a mirror , and a giant mirror fell on a guy named dave .
but , uh ...
no mary .
maybe we just haven't found it yet .
i've also been searching for strange deaths , in the area , you know , eyeball bleeding , that sort of thing .
there's nothing .
whatever's happening here , maybe it just ain't mary .
hello?
and they found her on the bathroom floor .
and her her eyes ... they were gone .
i'm sorry .
and she said it .
i heard her say it .
but it couldn't be because of that .
i'm insane , right?
no , you're not insane .
god , that makes me feel so much worse .
look ...
we think something's happening here , something that can't be explained .
and we're gonna stop it , but we could use your help .
what did you tell jill's mom?
i just said i needed some time alone with jill's pictures and things .
great .
i hate lying to her .
this is for the greater good .
hit the lights .
what are you guys looking for?
we'll let you know as soon as we find it .
hey , night vision .
thanks .
perfect .
do i look like paris hilton?
so , i don't get it .
i mean , the first victim didn't summon mary , and the second victim did .
how's she choosing them?
beats me .
i want to know why jill said it in the first place .
it's just a joke .
somebody's gonna say it again .
it's just a matter of time .
hey .
there's a black light in the trunk , right?
gary bryman?
you know who that is?
no .
so , gary bryman was an 8 year old boy .
two years ago , he was killed in a hit and run .
the car was described as a black toyota camry , but nobody got the plates or saw the driver .
oh , my god .
what?
jill drove that car .
we need to get back to your friend donna's house .
linda shoemaker .
why are you asking me this?
look , we're sorry , but it's important .
yeah .
linda's my mom , okay?
and she overdosed on sleeping pills .
it was an accident , and that's it .
i think you should leave .
donna , just listen get out of my house !
oh , my god .
do you really think her dad could have killed her mom?
maybe .
i think i should stick around .
all right .
whatever you do , don't ...
believe me , i won't say it .
wait , wait , wait .
you're doing a nationwide search?
yep .
the nclc , the fbi database any mary in the country who died in front of a mirror is good enough for me .
but if she's haunting the town , she should have died in the town .
i'm telling you .
there's nothing local .
i check .
so , unless you've gota better idea .
why mary's choosing a victim?
it seems like there's a pattern .
i know i was thinking the same thing .
with mr .
shoemaker and jill's hit and run both had secrets where people died .
right .
there's a lot of folklore about mirrors that they reveal or your lies , or your secrets , that they're a true reflection of your soul , which is why it's bad luck to break them .
right .
right .
yeah , so maybe if you've got a secret ,
i mean , like a really nasty one where someone died , then mary sees it and punishes you for it .
whether you summoned her or not .
take a look at this .
looks like the same handprint .
her name was mary worthington an unsolved murder in fort wayne , indiana .
i was on the job for 35 years , detective for most of that .
now , everybody packs it in with a few loose ends , but the mary worthington murder ... that one still gets me .
what exactly happened?
you boys said you were reporters .
we know mary was 19 ,
lived by herself .
we know she won a few beauty contests , dreamt of getting out of indiana , being an actress .
and we know , the night of march 29th , someone broke into her apartment and murdered her , cut out her eyeswith a knife .
that's right .
see , sir , when we ask you what happened , we want to know what you think happened .
technically , i'm not supposed to have a copy of this .
now , see that there ,
t r e "?
yeah .
i think mary was trying to spell out the name of her killer .
you know who it was?
not for sure .
but there was a local man , a surgeon ,
trevor sampson .
and i think he cut her up good .
now , why would he do something like that?
her diary mentioned a man she was seeing .
she called him by his initial , " t.
well , her last entry , she was gonna tell to his wife about their affair .
but how do you know it was sampson who killed her?
it's hard to say .
but the way her eyes were cut out , it was almost professional .
but you could never prove it?
no .
no prints , no witnesses .
he was meticulous .
is he still alive?
nope .
if you ask me ,
mary spent her last living moments trying to expose this guy's secret .
but she never could .
where's she buried?
she wasn't .
she was cremated .
what about that mirror?
it's not in evidence lockup somewhere , is it?
no .
it was returned to mary's family a long time ago .
you have the names of her family by any chance?
i mean , you bring these strangers into my house , and they ask me things like that?
they were only trying to help .
please , donna , you have to believe me .
what?
about bloody mary?
please , i know it sounds crazy .
crazy " doesn't even begin to cover it .
i mean , it's one thing for my sister to believe this crap .
she's 12 .
but you?
think about the way your dad died , okay , and the way jill died .
okay , so ...
bloody mary .
no !
bloody mary .
bloody mary .
see?
nothing happened .
why would you do that?
oh , my god , there really is something wrong with you .
elements that lose electrons become positive ions , which are smaller than other atoms of the same element .
therefore , the ionic radius is smaller than the atomic radius
charlie !
charlie !
charlie , stop it !
what's wrong?
just calm down !
charlie !
aah !
let me go !
charlie !
oh , really?
ah , that's too bad , mr. worthington .
i would have paid a lot for that mirror .
okay , well , maybe next time .
all right , thanks .
so?
so , that was mary's brother .
the mirror was in the family for years , until he sold it one week ago to a store called estate antiques , a store in toledo .
so wherever the mirror goes , that's where mary goes?
her spirit's definitely tied up with it somehow .
isn't there an old superstition that says mirrors can capture spirits?
yeah , there is .
when someone would die in a house , people would cover up the mirrors so the ghost wouldn't get trapped .
this mary dies in front of the mirror , and it draws in her spirit .
yeah , but how could she move through 100 different mirrors?
i don't know but if the mirror is the source ,
i say we find it and smash it .
yeah , i don't know .
maybe .
hello?
charlie?
hey .
hey .
it's okay .
you can open up your eyes , charlie .
it's okay , all right?
now , listen .
you're gonna stay right here on this bed .
you're not gonna look at glass or anything else that has a reflection , okay? as long as you do that she cannot get you .
but i can't keep that up forever .
i'm gonna die , aren't i?
no .
no .
not anytime soon .
all right , charlie , we need to know what happened .
we were in the bathroom .
donna said it .
that's not what we're talking about .
something happened , didn't it , in your life .
a secret ... where someone got hurt?
can you tell us about it?
i had this boyfriend .
i loved him .
but he kind of scared me , too , you know?
and ... one night at his house , we got in this fight .
then i broke up with him , and he got upset and he said he needed me and he loved me .
and he said ... " charlie , if you walk out that door right now , i'm gonna kill myself .
and you know what i said?
i said , " go ahead .
and i left .
how could i say that?
how could i leave him like that?
i just ...
i didn't believe him , you know?
i should have .
her boyfriend killing himself , that's not really charlie's fault .
you know as well as i do , spirits don't exactly see shades of gray ,
dean .
charlie had a secret , someone died .
that's good enough for mary .
i guess .
you know, i've been thinking , it might not be enough to just smash that mirror .
why , what do you mean?
mary's hard to pin down , right?
and she moves around from mirror to mirror .
so , who's to say that she's not gonna just keep hiding in them forever?
so maybe ... we should try to pin her down , you know , summon her to her mirror and then smash it .
well , how do you know that's gonna work?
i don't ,
i'm not for sure .
well , who's gonnasummon her?
i will .
she'll come after me .
all right , you know what?
that's it .
this is about jessica , isn't it?
you think that's your dirty little secret , that you killed her somehow?
sam , this has got to stop , man .
i mean , the nightmares and and calling her name out in the middle of the night , it's gonna kill you .
now , listen to me .
it wasn't your fault .
if you want to blame something , then blame the thing that killed her .
or , hell , why don't you take a swing at me?
i'm the one that dragged you away from her the first place .
i don't blame you .
you shouldn't blame yourself , because there's nothingyou could've done .
i could've warned her .
about what? !
you didn't know what was gonna happen .
and , besides , all of this isn't a secret .
i mean , i know all about it .
it's not gonna work with mary anyway .
no , you don't .
i don't what?
you don't know all about it .
i haven't told you everything .
what are you talking about?
it wouldn't really be a secret if i told you , would it?
no .
i don't like it .
it's not gonna happen .
forget it .
dean , that girl back there is going to die unless we do something about it .
and you know what?
who knows how many more people are gonna die after that?
now , we're doing this .
you've got to let me do this .
well , that's just great .
all right , let's start looking .
maybe they've already sold it .
i don't think so .
that's it .
you sure about this?
bloody mary .
bloody mary .
bloody mary .
i'll go check that out .
stay here .
be careful .
smash anything that moves .
crap .
hold on
whoa , guys , false alarm .
i tripped the system .
who are you?
i'm the boss's kid .
you're mr. yamashiro's kid?
come on .
come into this one .
it's your fault .
you killed her .
you killed jessica .
like i said , i was adopted .
yeah .
you know , i just
i really don't have timefor this right now .
you never told her the truth , who you really were .
but it's more than that, isn't it?
those nightmares you've been having of jessica dying , screaming , burning you had them for days before she died .
didn't you? !
you were so desperateto ignore them , to believethey were just dreams .
how could you ignore them like that?
how could you leave her alone to die?
you dreamt it would happen !
dude .
sammy , sammy !
it's sam .
god , are you okay?
uh , yeah .
come on , come on .
you killed them !
all those people !
you killed them !
hey , sam?
yeah?
that's got to be like what , 600 years of bad luck?
so this is really over?
yeah , it's over .
thank you .
charlie?
your boyfriend's death , you really should try to forgive yourself .
no matter what you did , you probably couldn't have stopped it .
sometimes bad things just happen .
that's good advice .
hey , sam?
yeah?
now that this is all over ,
i want you to tell me what that secret is .
look ...
you're my brother .
and i'd die for you .
but there are some things i need to keep to myself .
