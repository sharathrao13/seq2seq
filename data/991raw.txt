did you blow the candles out downstairs?
yeah .
look at this .
a thanksgiving cornucopia made of pie plates and spackle .
what the heck is a cornucopia?
it's like a horn of plenty .
oh , dear , can't it wait?
we just finished decorating for halloween .
well , good night .
good night .
go look !
just a prank , that's all .
anton .
our little scooter would never do something like that .
quit calling him that baby name .
anton would not scoot his behind off the couch if the house was on fire .
god knows he didn't help me with the halloween decorations .
did you hear that?
i heard something downstairs .
well , the dog's out in the yard .
it's probably just the cat .
well , go see !
hey , bones .
gary?
anton?
gary , you said you
the house could burn down !
wake up !
anton , is that you?
if you'd like to make a call , hang up and try again .
if you need help , hang up and then dial your operator .
hey , mom !
we're out of milk !
mom , we're out of dog food !
a special report .
four bodies were found .
and the killer is still at large .
bolan is gripped with fear ... ... as killings spread from a postal route ... ... to the bowling alley and now to our own burger jungle .
with halloween only one day away ... ... bolan officials have set a 9 p . m . curfew for all teenagers .
hey , what's up , man?
what's up with you?
i'm dry .
so?
so why don't you bring me a dimer?
this ain't domino's , you lazy bitch .
come over and get it .
come on , man .
i'm comfortable .
hello?
what's up , anton?
nice outfit !
yeah? lf your mom had teeth , she wouldn't suck dick so well .
what's your point?
what's up , anton?
how's it going , brother?
nice boxers .
pass the chronic .
i'm sorry , man .
this bong is cashed .
you said you was holding .
i didn't say what i was holding .
that's messed up .
i hear if you combine nutmeg and oregano you can get pretty wasted .
all you do is smoke pot ... ... and watch tv all day .
don't get me wrong .
that's what life is all about .
but don't you think you should have some ambition , a goal?
i mean , my dream life would be ... ... to lie around and watch tv while some hot broad delivers me food .
until your parents kick your oily ass out .
i haven't seen my parents in a few days .
maybe they're dead .
party at anton's .
what are you doing?
with a killer loose , you can't rule out murder .
what killer?
don't you watch the news?
i hate that fucking show .
our little town is in the national spotlight .
local mailman , iced .
barmaid at the bowling alley , iced .
you haven't heard about the twins?
they were jerking off in the milkshake maker again?
iced times two .
last night , when they were working at burger jungle .
damn .
anton , here comes your woman .
he's got serious problems .
molly's lived across the street for , like , what , ever?
tell her about your obsession with her .
start by telling her your name .
yeah , man .
she's waiting for you .
she's not waiting for me .
would you stop being such a puss and go , like , ask her to the dance .
what dance?
if you'd been to school recently , you'd know .
halloween thing in the gym?
9 : 00 curfew?
no trick or treating allowed?
dumb dance is the only option .
you guys going?
hell , no .
can you see us in stupid ass costumes?
grooving to hanson and jewel?
what do we look like , total losers , man?
i see your point .
she dropped her lyrics book .
she'll catch you reading that over her shoulder in biology .
her songs are badass .
she's like a poet or something .
go bring it back to her .
be like a knight in shining armor .
she'd be all grateful , invite me in , offer me a drink , i'd accept .
she'd rip your clothes off ... ... and make sweet love to you , red shoe diary style .
right .
could happen .
just go talk to her , man !
maybe she'll think you're funny .
you know what?
i think i'm going to .
you want to borrow some pants , chief?
first impressions and all .
you're a bud .
think he's going to do it?
so you got to reach .
you're getting cheezy poofs everywhere .
you got to open your mouth , man .
lookie what i found .
i thought you were dry .
i guess not .
fire me up .
these are great .
my book !
thank you for ... ... returning it .
you're certain this is the right man?
well , i'll tell you , sister liquor
that's lecure .
debi's fine .
all right , sister debi .

beaver .
bolan .
wait a minute .
wait a minute .
holy shit !
don't move !
roll over !
roll over !
anton tobias .

i live here .
since when is it illegal to grocery shop?
hey , i know you guys .
you guys were seniors when i was a freshman .
let's talk about high school .
you and your stoner friends zipping around on skateboards .
thought you were too cool for us .
did you ever , even once , invite us to get high behind the gym?
you were dorks .
either of you holding?
what?
i'm desperate .
i know you can get in the evidence room
you asshole !
you're trying to score from a cop?
that's it .
complete personal effects search .

ant "?

do you have an evil aunt?
holy shit !

ear rings?
they're both lefts .
you know what that means .
feldstein twins .
the killer was wearing your shirt .
the killer was wearing me .
i'm the killer .
i'm going to call 91 1 .
what's the number?
there's something wrong with my friend .
i think he took some nutmeg or something .
mick , buddy .
i would remember something like that .
you would .
i'm not the killer .
you know?
yeah , i know .
but if o. j. could get off , then i'm sure
do you want a beer?
no , thanks .
you sure?
talk to me !
what the hell is happening to me?
pnub , man .
i didn't do it .
okay , i did it .
but it was an accident .
i can't believe you told me to smoke that shit !
okay , anton .
i have to leave now .
yeah , that's probably a good idea .
it's the basement !
you can't get out that way !
why are you doing this?
i don't know !
it's me , pnub !
your buddy !
i know who you are .
i don't want to hurt you .
then don't !
it's not me !
it's my hand !
it's like i have no control over my hand !
i don't know how long i can hold it .
run !
get out of my way !
just go !
it's going to be okay .
i won't tell anybody .
i swear .
everything will be cool .
everything will be ...
... cool .
what have i done?
what have i done?
get out of here , bones !
git !
bones?
here , kitty , kitty .
aren't you a little old for ding dong ditch?
sorry about your bush .
no problem .
what were you doing out there anyway?
jesus , look at you .
i was looking for my cat .
we got in a fight .
you sure got your ass kicked .
i did okay .
so you ran and hid in my bush .
i shouldn't be here .
i'm not myself today .
i'm someone completely different .
you're so shy .
it's okay , i get it .
so let's skip this chickening out , sneaking around stage .
no , you don't understand .
i'm
do you want to come inside and talk?
you never gave me a chance to thank you .
that book is important to me .
so ... ... nothing cooler than a chick bass guitar player .
especially one that writes her own lyrics .
you read them?
i couldn't help looking in the book .
they're amazing .
look , i even got my favorites memorized .
devil girl with nothing to lose
she got wind in herhair and gum on her shoes
i was 1 3 when i wrote that .
yeah , well ... ... they're amazing .
thanks .
i should not be here , molly .
safer in here than on the streets .
there's a killer out there .
that's exactly what i'm saying .
i'm dangerous .
oh , yeah?
how dangerous?
i'm not kidding .
i've done stuff , you know?
i'm impressed .
i never would've thought you'd have the balls to just grab me like that .
me neither .
you're kinky .
that's me .
move it , people !
let's go !
some of us are on serious missions here .
there's evil out there and i got to kick its ass !
shit , my parents are home .
we'll pick this up later .
my parents might take offense to some bloody boy banging their daughter .
tomorrow .
you want to see me?
come by at seven .
the curfew's annihilated our options , but we can go to the dance .
i thought you said the streets weren't safe .
i'll protect you .
dearly beloved ... ... we're gathered here today because you're all dead .
and it's my fault .
mom , dad ... ... what can i say?
i mean ... ... you brought me into this world ... ... you put a roof over my head , you fed me until i killed you .
if you look at it that way , i haven't been a good son , but i'm really ... ... really , really sorry .
and wherever you are ... ... l just want you to forgive me ... ... because i'm going to try to change .
mick ... ... pnub , guys ....
you guys were the greatest .
i'm never going to forget the way we sat around all day ... ... watched tv and got really stoned .
and all those other times where we just ....
i guess that's all we did .
amen .
over here .
anton , help me .
come on , man .
i can't breathe down here .
anton , can you hear me?
yeah , man , mick .
now get me out of here .
you're dead .
no , i'm not .
you conked my head pretty good .
i must've been unconscious .
you think?
i know , fucker , now dig me up !
stay where you are , mick !
please don't kill me .
watch it , man !
what did i take last night?
that dream was intense .
intense .
turn it up .
check it out .
yeah , i'm watching .
did you see?
guys !
that's funny .
thank god you're alive , because i had this dream that i killed
oh , shit !
sorry about that thing with the shovel .
you're dead .
easy , tiger .
undead , actually .
you said you were unconscious .
you lied .
you killed me , all right?
try and keep this thing in perspective .
i was bitter about the getting killed by my best friend thing ... ... but i got over it .
so why you here?
we need a place to kick it .
don't be selfish .
no one else's parents are dead .
no , not why are you " here " here .
i mean ....
are you flesh eating zombies back from hell to exact revenge?
is that it?
why would we go to hell?
we're not bad .
it's not like we're good , but at least we don't kill people !
i didn't kill anybody on purpose .
yeah , well , we weren't in hell .
there was this bright light at the end of a long tunnel .
there were all these chicks 'voices .
and that music .
music?
kind of uncool music , like enya .
and these chicks were saying ... ... " come to us .
come towards the light .
so what happened?
we figured , fuck it .
i mean , it was really far .
i've got to ask .
what's with the hand?
it doesn't obey me at all .
the only thing i can come up with is it's got to be possessed .
do you guys know anything about satan or evil or ...?
but we know somebody who does .
did you know them well?
not really .
you?
yeah , they were great .
i just feel really bad , you know?
because i was always so mean to them .
like this one time , they asked me to go out on a double date ... ... and i thought they were 'tards , because there's only one of me .
so i told them to go blow each other .
did they?
the way you treated them ... ... the guilt must be making you feel like shit inside .
randy !
you still in high school?
yeah , me , i got out about three years ago .
i need your help .
what are you playing , a little two ball?
look , i got to talk to you .
serious stuff is going on .
anton , can't you see i'm getting a little action over here?
oh , man .
i can't believe you cock blocked me like that .
i thought we were buds .
randy , wait !
i didn't mean to mess you up .
listen .
i need your help .
piss off !
fresh tomatoes ....
hey !
who are you?
new .
drive thru duty .
excuse me .
sorry .
break time .
all right .
give me the big five with the spicy safari fries ... ... the african apple turnover ... ... and the raspberry rainforest shake .
slap some extra mustard on that jungle burger .
tell me everything you know about the devil .
are you out of your fucking mind?
you listen to satanic music .
you must've picked up something .
look , it's just music .
like mozart and that other fag ....
keep it clean .
who , beethoven?
that's the guy .
it's just like their music , only louder .
you got to know .
i'm desperate .
oh , man !
here !
asshole !
it's my hand .
it's like it's got a mind of its own .
it makes me do things i don't want it to do .
i used to be like that .
get into all kinds of stupid shit .
look , the trick is ... ... to keep yourself busy .
that's why i'm always working on the ford .
keeps me out of trouble .
idle hands are the devil's playground .
keep my hands busy .
yeah , that actually makes sense .
thanks .
you're the coolest .
so do you , like , knit now?
don't take this the wrong way , but you look queer doing that .
randy broke it down for me .
ldle hands are the devil's playpen .
so i'm thinking ... ... keep my hands occupied , right?
man , that saying's not literal .
it's more like ... ... you know ....
metaphorical?
right .
this is the noise complaint .
ain't this the tobias residence?
holy shit !
it's anton .
he's the killer !
i better call for backup .
are you crazy?
and let the feds get the credit?
lf we collar him , we'll be heroes .
we can't go in without a warrant .
piss on the bill of rights !
we got just cause .
freeze !
yeah , freeze !
guys ... ... what do i do?
i think you
i was going to say do what the officers tell you ... ... but now i changed my mind .
you should just kill them .
they're alive !
they are not !
you shot one in the head !
they're morgue meat .
look , guys .
i don't want to kill anybody else .
you don't want to go to jail , though .
jail .
that's it !
they'll throw me in a rubber room .
i can't hurt anybody else .
cuff me !
okay .
just ... ... drop the knitting needles .
that's not a good idea .
why don't you just cuff me?
drop the needles and put your hands on your head !
i can't !
put down the needles and come quietly .
cuff me !
put the needles down !
now !
cuff me !
put them down !
put them down !
cuff me !
go , go , buffalo !
stop !
i didn't do it .
it was my hand .
it's like , the knitting didn't help at all .
i told you that saying was more , like , metaphorical .
i can't keep doing this !
i'm losing my mind .
get your head .
no way .
it's the only thing i can think of .
once that hand is gone , how will you cut off the other one?
the left one's a keeper .
i mean , i guess it wasn't idle enough .
are you sure?
i use it for a lot of things .
i light up , i change the remote ... ... l relieve a little tension .
this is the answer .
i know it .
those things won't even cut my bagel .
shit !
grab the carver .
look at me !
i'm leatherface !
thanks , mick .
i'll just use this one .
i can't watch .
you missed .
pnub ... ... bite down .
don't cut me , man !
you scream like a girl .
what the hell are you doing?
i got to stop the blood flow .
don't you watch er?
look at that nasty thing .
that'll be infected for sure .
you got any antiseptic , anton?
i don't know .
pnub's got some in a first aid kit in his house .
and burritos .
you'll be okay , buddy .
we'll be back in a sec to fix you up , anton .
catch you on the flip flop .
oh , shit !
anton , are you home?
don't come in !
just stay there , okay?
very funny , anton .
stay out there , molly !
i'm freezing my butt off .
anton , we're going to be late .
anton , i can hear you in there !
stay outside !
come on , anton !
let's go !
we're going to be late !
we're going to miss the band .
fry !
gross .
anton , i'm coming in .
wait !
you look incredible .
thanks .
but you should've called .
if you needed more time with your costume , fine .
but i hate waiting .
so what are you supposed to be , anyway?
i'm a ... ... fast food employee that cut off his own hand .
cute .
come on !
anton , we're back !
we got antiseptic and adhesive bandages !
the ouch free kind !
microwave for three minutes and enjoy .
this is getting on my nerves .
what are you doing?
could you ...?
this way .
easy .
that's better .
all right .
thanks , man !
gross !
maybe we should clean it first .
while we're at it , we can clean the whole house .
this ain't our mess .
look , i can't go to the dance yet , okay?
i'm sorry .
my parents will be home in a few minutes .
if they see the mess i made , they'll kill me .
look , i won't be too long .
i'll meet you there .
is something wrong?
you need to go there now ... ... and you can't stop till you're inside with everyone .
you wouldn't stand me up , would you?
not a chance , babysnakes .
i'll get the next one .
shit !
i bit my tongue .
that's disgusting .
i bet i can fix that for you .
hold still .
that's better .
burrito , burrito
wait , wait !
don't open it !
i'm sorry , there were only two .
no !
you let the hand out !
we brought you a first aid kit .
where did it go?
what?
you mean the hand?
of course , the hand .
try looking up your ass .
damn .
hey , foxy .
looking for a ball?
because i could help you find one that's the right size for you .
what the hell?
try and keep up .
i'd be happy to keep up with you , sweet thing .
didn't you have a dance to go to?
that's right .
we got to do our costumes .
you coming , randy?
i think i can find myself a ride .
all right .
so what brings you to bolan?
you don't want to know .
no , seriously .
i'm interested .
really?
here it goes .
i'm a druidic priestess sworn to fight a certain evil force ... ... that possesses the laziest fuckup it can find .
it will kill as many people as possible ... ... and then drag a free soul into the netherworld .
that's some weighty shit there .
here's the kicker .
i have the one thing that can stop this from happening .
i just need to find the bastard whose hand is possessed .
weird .
earlier today , this guy , anton , told me that his hand was doing stuff ... ... that he didn't want it to do .
don't you fuck with me !
ease up , there , kitten .
i'm telling you the truth .
this guy was freaked !
show me where he lives .
left !
turn left !
guys !
we got to go to the dance .
the hand , it's after molly .
let's check out the dance .
i'll win best costume .
chicks dig winners .
i'll probably hook up .
yeah , because severed heads are one of the top ten big turn ons .
it kills me to see you stressed out .
you cut off your hand in the interest of however many others .
it's not your problem anymore .
so what i want you to do is take a little anton time .
just relax and kick back , my man .
no , no .
you know what?
not this time , okay?
i'm through with that .
all i do is sit around .
i veg out , i watch tv , i smoke pot
no kevin costner speeches .
let's just go .
come on !
let's go !
come on , come on !
that's him !
they're getting into my ford !
wait here .
he's dangerous .
wait .
don't let him steal my ford .
trust me .
i know what i'm doing .
that's lucky .
shit .
couldn't be automatic .
want me to drive?
no , just shift for me .
anton !
wait !
what was that?
who cares?
get back here !
who's got the barf breath?
damn !
it's hot in here .
so are you , babe .
i'm sweating my costume off , curtis .
better?
help me get this off .
right there .
it's here .
you guys go in the dance , protect molly .
i'll go after the hand .
what a waste .
you didn't like curtis .
i'm talking about that ass !
well , at least he died happy .
what's bugging you?
just thinking .
and i know who about .
just thought he'd be here by now .
he'll be here .
i'll go get punch .
want some?
okay , i'll be right back .
you guys look great !
who did your makeup?
i guess anton did .
based on my design , though .
you want to dance?
hell , yeah !
we should find molly .
quit being a skirt .
we'll look for her while we dance .
there's plenty of chicks here .
careful , it's on kind of loose .
cool !
don't put me on hold again .
i want to talk to your supervisor .
what?
yes , of course .
what's taking so long?
ls this the supervisor?
what do you mean my credit card is no good?
well , you must have the wrong number .
no , it's 8 4 6 8 .
that's good .
i think you've been a bad girl ... ... and i want to spank you with my ruler .
yes , that's nice .
that is nice .
now i'm hot .
i'm hot .
you got me so hot , it's like i can feel you touching me .
i can feel you touching me .
bingo !
come on !
we got to find anton !
and kick his ass !
are you anton?
if you're a teacher , we'll discuss my attendance later
i found you !
my name is debi le cure .
i know what's happening .
i could stop it .
really , how?
die !
yeah , fuck him up , debi !
the host of evil must die !
isn't that knife a little extreme , kitten?
you won't go anywhere , evil hosting fuck stick .
nobody touches my ford !
come on , debi .
give him what for .
wait , wait !
i'm not a host .
okay , look .
the evil was in my hand , all right?
i cut it off .
okay?
oh , shit !
you let it loose?
that was probably a mistake .
no kidding .
and now it's after my girlfriend .
you got a girlfriend?
i got to stop it .
it's out for blood .
that ain't all it's out for .
if your girl's the one it's after , then at midnight ... ... it's taking her to hell .
hell?
it's not even 9 o'clock yet .
we got some time .
it's actually ... ... six minutes till midnight , druid time .
druid time .
right .
let's go !
oh , god !
that's disgusting .
come on , man .
you're dead .
you know , think about it .
it's illegal .
move !
look out !
move !
everybody , go home !
there's a psycho killer here !
i cut off my hand and it'll kill you all .
get off the stage !
it's true .
his hand killed us yesterday .
yeah , it sliced me up real good .
molly , you out there?
get out of here , kid !
crank it up !
you had your fun !
now it's time
shit !
god !
did you see that thing?
i have to get anton !
no , screw him !
i mean , he'll be fine !
come on !
in there?
you want to stay out here and get killed and or trampled?
i was going to get some .
i really doubt it .
pnub's a lot more creative than i thought .
i mean , he's actually kind of cool .
he had that costume  maybe we should go faster .
i don't know if he did it or
wait , wait !
what , what
go !
oh , shit !
we're trapped in here !
it's going to get me !
it's not going to get you !
it's not going to get you !
we can't go through the blade !
we'll be pulverized !
give me your shoe !
what are you going to do?
no , no .
oh , god , it's too far !
i can't drop that far !
we'll die in this vent !
we won't die .
we'll die here .
the rats will eat us , and nobody will find us .
okay , we're good .
be careful .
all right , let's go !
this would be more comfortable if your ass wasn't so wide .
this is dumb .
anton needs our help .
the best thing about being dead is zero responsibility .
that's tanya .
let's save her .
come on !
she needs me .
she needs you like a fish needs
okay , this sucks .
grab the cord and come down !
i can't .
i can't , i'm scared !
do it , tanya !
come on !
