teamwork , sportsmanship , how your friends look naked .
you'll notice your grade cards are blank .
who better to evaluate a student's progress than the student himself?

no summer school .
wait , you gave me your word .
that was the old word .
my new one is " money " .
you would let 50 grand weaken your commitment to education?
lesser men win millions , go right back to busing tables !
they're frigging morons !
let me out of here !
let me out of here !
don't look at me .
you're in charge of summer school .
may i speak with you a minute?

double negative .
no , i hand out basketballs , check for jockstraps .
i'm , like , very challenged .
i'm not a real teacher .
that's all right .
these aren't real students .
they're unmotivated , irresponsible .
they'll relate to you .
i appreciate that .
no , the reason i got into this whole teaching gig was to get summers off .
no , i'm afraid my answer has to be no .
no , thank you?
bottom line , you need my recommendation for tenure .
this is blackmail .
we call it school spirit .
kim .
have you ever seen the wizard of oz?
oh , i love that movie .
yeah .
yeah , me too .
and my favorite part is when dorothy , she clicks her heels together and she says , " there's no place like home .
there is no place like home .
oh , shoop , i understand .
you do?
you're not disappointed?
no .
i'll just go by myself .
what , alone?
i'll make friends .
look , kim , if you love me , even if you just like me a lot , you won't do this .
if i didn't like you , i wouldn't ask you to drive me to the airport , now would i?
guess not .
you're in room 43 .

they're here voluntarily .

no .
i've seen some of your students .
very scary .
you must be a good teacher .
shucks , robin , i don't know .
heck , inside every so called bad kid is a good kid waiting for someone to reach down through the sleaze and slime , pick him up and hose him off .
if we fail with even one child , we might be losing the next ted koppel .
we're the unsung heroes doing god's work .
you're not wearing a wedding ring .
yeah , my mother noticed that too .
so you're single .

you give a child the license to swear , they lose all interest in it .
i certainly did .
you're full of bull .
it's ok , you can say " bullshit " in here .
i'm grateful .
i'm sure you're aware that i'm teaching next door .
and this swearing is getting a little loud .

i don't belong in a classroom .
apology accepted .

let's start all over .
hi , i'm freddy shoop .
look , you're a semi charming guy and a snappy dresser .
you're not the kind of guy i date .
yeah?
what kind are you dating?
oh , the kind who wears socks .
i got a pair somewhere .
white ones .
so about dinner , you like italian?
mexican?
hey , maybe you'd rather cook .
i'm not having dinner with you .
ok , lunch .
robin .
excuse me just one second .
robin , about tonight , the concert starts at 8 .
i thought we'd go to the beach and have a picnic .
watch the sunset .
sounds wonderful .
oh , bye bye , freddy .
i'll be darned .
you're a heterosexual .
and a damned good one .
good luck , honey .
thanks , mom .
ok , start her up .
make a right , please .
these photos suck .
weddings , graduations .
hoffman came in .
yeah .
it's more of the redhead with the tattoo .
this time he's got her making breakfast stark raving naked .
oh , hoffman , you're so sick .
check out this composition .
round english muffin , square butter , triangular bush .
the man is an artist .
reprints .
reprints .
hi , i'd like to sign up for lamaze classes .
ok , how are tuesday nights for you and your coach?
perfect , but i don't have a coach .
well , what about the father?
well , that's sort of confusing .
it's either david lee roth , who's on tour , or sean penn .
and i'd really hate to upset madonna .
fill this out .
ok .
how far did we get yesterday?
you took roll .
right .
that shouldn't take as long today .
pam .
mr. shoop , i gotta book .
what?
you just got here .
yeah .
it's a female thing .
oh , yeah , i understand .
oh , man , she's going surfing !
i'm sure .
fuck .
this menstruation deal , it's such a scam .
girls are so lucky .
what?
oh , we're so lucky?
you think being on your period is some picnic?
are you crazy?
you get pms , there's no room in your purse for no hairbrush because you got these mini pads .
you are so ignorant !
this whole class is jammed with ignorance .
yes , it is .
come in here , please .
mr. shoop , this is our new foreign exchange student ,
anna maria mazarelli .
anna maria is from milan , italy .
she would like to brush up her english skills before the fall semester begins .
well , i'll let you return to your rigorous pursuit of academic excellence .
please .
anna maria , welcome to america .
you can sit wherever you want .
you looking for a seat?
well , now , this desk appears to be unoccupied .
grazie .
ok , let's see what we got here .
rules of grammar .
writing paragraphs .
god , i hate this stuff .
book reports .
wanna get out of here?
go to the library?
yeah .
yeah .
let's go .
i am chainsaw .
hi , chainsaw .
hi , i'm dave .
ciao .
hi , i'm dave .
ciao .
well , we love italy .
yeah .
the pizza .
mussolini .
and tony bennett .
the mafia .
yeah .
chef boyardee .
pinocchio .
fellatio .
oh , i don't like that .
well , have you ever tried it?
sure .
chef boyardee , spaghetti in a can .
it's so mushy .
anna maria?
have you seen the movie texas chainsaw massacre?
no .
it is good?
oh , i gotta tell you , i love this film .
it had passion and a plucky spirit .
and the characters had integrity .
like when leatherface went on a strict diet of human flesh .
he had to cut out chicken and fish .
i agree with you .
i'll go a step further .
leatherface wore a mask made out of human skin , he hung people on meat hooks , but we've all got quirks .
i've got them .
you got them .
that's what makes this character so compelling .
thumbs up from me .
same here .
to sum it up , i'm chainsaw .
i'm dave .
we'll see you at the movies .
ok .
let's go , people .
i found them at winchell's .
here , we all chipped in .
hey , jelly .
i'm touched .
this one was in the parking lot with a surfboard .
this is so humiliating .
pam .
you know , i grew up surfing those same waves .
today was phenom .
three to four , breaking out of the south , glassy , light offshore breeze .
had to go for the ditch .
thanks .
you're very spiritual .
but the rest of you clowns ...
hey , i gotta say something .
this whole thing is a joke .
there's a very valid reason for summer vacation .
the human brain needs rest .
yeah .
i mean , what are we doing here?
really .
i don't wanna be here .
hey , look , this wasn't my idea .
you guys aren't fired up about english .
i wouldn't know what to do if you were .
but we're stuck here .
we're trapped like rats .
anybody got any ideas?
why don't we take some field trips?
can we do that?
sure , yeah .
i got permission slips right here .
ok , take these home , have your mom or dad sign them , i'll see what i can do .
done .
same here .
good .
the screwdriver was a disappointment .
i was hoping for a headache or pounding temples , a blackout , but , you know , i feel fine .
actually , my headache is gone .
thumbs down .
i'm surprised .
i found the screwdriver simply delightful .
fast corners .
that third loop was a surprise .
the line moved fast .
is he ok?
no , it appears that he's vomiting .
that's a sure sign of a good ride .
thumbs up .
eakian , what did you eat?
don't be a pig .
no .
hey !
hey , you slime .
stones 'first farewell tour , '69 .
get out of here .
oh , wait .
he ripped my t shirt .
oh , i can sew that .
it's not necessary .
go away !
nothing's necessary .
i want to .
great , i'll let you .
get them off !
get them off me !
the bunnies from hell !
oh , god !
get away from me !
oh , dear !
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
thank you very much .
what is this?
it's a lie .
we did this for you .
how did you like it?
it's disgusting !
i love it .
what is that?
oh , it's foam latex .
keep it .
you guys .
next field trip , it's gotta be at the beach .
we gotta see anna maria in a bikini .
it's very important .
i understand .
girl , this ain't the riviera .
thank you .
that was ...
that was ...
that was cruel .
you ok?
come in , come in , mrs. eakian .
now , how can i help you?
yesterday alan came home nauseous , sneezing , wheezing and itching , with goat hairs on his clothes .
he said he was at the museum ,
but i found this in his pocket .
grandma ...
is going on throw up rides and rubbing barnyard animals your idea of quality education?
grandma ...
certainly not .
we'll talk to mr. shoop about this right now .
i may have used poor judgment .
you actually used judgment .
do you realize if anything happened to these kids , the lawsuits?
you could've bankrupt the entire district !
and mess up your chance at election to state assembly?
yes .
don't wet your pants .
watch this .
all you had to do was babysit some social deviants .
those deviants are great kids .
i'm sure they'll grow up to be wonderful criminals .
they're as smart as you and me .
you and i.
all of us .
you're suspended until kelban returns and fires you .
what?
hey , this is your fault .
you knew i couldn't teach .
goodbye , mr. shoop .
gills , what if i become a model teacher?
this is gonna be fun .
ok .
you get every kid left in your class to pass that skills test and i'll forget about your field trips .
done .
they all have to pass?
it's called teaching .
if you don't know how to do that , then i guess you don't deserve tenure .
do you?
i'll teach .
morning , class .
nice tie !
oh , baby .
mr. shoop , what's with the threads , man?
you getting married?
no , must be laundry day .
nothing else was clean .
funeral?
could we come?
please take your seats .
where should we take them?
sit down , francis .
from this moment forth , you people eat english , sleep english .
you are english .
oh , then pass the crumpets , old boy .
i'm not kidding around .
anyone not interested in passing that exam can leave right now .
the guy's been pretty cool .
he called me francis .
hasta luego , placido domingo .
chainsaw , dave , wait a minute .
look , gills is having a cow about our field trips .
unless you guys all pass that test , my job?
memorex .
anybody got any ideas here?
get yourself some want ads .
i don't care what your files say .
you are not that dumb .
actually , mr. shoop , those files are usually right on the money .
you all feel that way?
i do .
i may as well go home .
mr. shoop?
look , we don't want you to lose your job .
think about what you're asking .
you want us to study?
the thought did cross my mind .
well , what's in it for us?
literacy .
oh , sorry , that's ...
i'd like to help .
what can i do?
give me your car .
your house .
and your dog .
see you .
wait , wait !
mr. shoop , wait !
there's room to negotiate .
what if you granted each one of us one wish?
what do you mean , " wish "?
you know , like a favor .
does anybody need anything?
i need somebody to work out with , in case i get back on the team .
i could use a lamaze coach .
i need some driving lessons .
bad .
ok , there's two of us .
therefore , we get two .
all right .
one , a party , your house , fourth of july weekend .
in anna maria's honor .
number two , you arrange a screening , in class , of the greatest movie ever made .
the 1973 tobe hooper classic the texas chainsaw massacre .
that is also in anna maria's honor .
thank you .
now , then , is there anything that you desire?
oh , i don't deserve a wish .
i don't take the test anyway .
god , she is so honest .
we'll take hers .
chauffeur service for dave and i , every day , to and from work .
pam , what's your wish?
i'll tell mr. shoop when the time is right .
larry?
larry , what do you want?
bed .
he wants a bed .
as for myself , i just wanna be invited to the party .
we'll see .
good enough .
i think these are fair and reasonable requests .
in return , we'll show up , we'll pay attention and we'll even do a little homework .
is this contract acceptable to labor?
no doubt .
yeah .
does management agree?
you sure i'm management?
for our purposes here , yes .
do we have a binding agreement?
we got something .
all right .
well , we put that baby to bed .
let's do lunch .
i always wanted to say that .
well , go ahead .
teach .
right .
teach .
don't anybody move .
the non proliferation treaty .
beagman?
excuse me , miss bishop .
mr. shoop .
shouldn't you be planning a field trip to 7 eleven?
i need your help .
i know how you feel about me , but something really bizarre has happened to my kids .
please .
all right .
please .
all right .
if i get next door and there's a candlelight dinner , i'm calling security .
continue .
the 1970 seabed treaty .
do you own that suit?
what did you do , pass out valiums?
this is a natural lull .
interesting phenomenon .
what do you want from me?
how do you teach?
if you're serious , i'll help you .
great .
meet me after school .
we'll make plans for the weekend .
for the weekend?
big guy .
ok .
the easiest thing to do is base your lesson plans on the students 'own experiences .
i can do that .
your life is probably very similar .
hardly .
i'm telling you , you gotta try these pop tarts .
no , thanks .
i'm sticking with the chocodiles .
the best teachers are the teachers who entertain while they teach .
so you should do just fine .
you think i'm entertaining?
to children .
i gotta go .
time's up .
i know why you're helping me .
professional courtesy .
no .
you like me .
no , i don't .
yes , you do .
no , i don't .
yeah , you do .
do not .
do too .
don't either .
come on .
don't you like me just a little bit?
no .
not even that much?
i like you that much .
it's a start .
now , someone tell me why learning how to write is so critical .
it's a form of communication .
amen .
and it can get you free stuff .
free?
free .
i'm writing the word ... ... free .
here's how it works .
all of us have been ripped off , right?
pay phone steals money , not enough cheese on your pizza .
my shades keep falling apart .
perfect .
you're gonna write that company .
you'll see action , if your letter is clearly written and threatens to hurt their business .
and is signed , forgive me , chainsaw ,
mr. francis gremp , president , consumer against faulty eyewear .
you want me to lie?
ok .
anyone interested in learning the correct form , please turn to page 46 in your textbook .
the shit works .
damn !
stupid son of a ...
i'm not cut out to be a linebacker .
no , you're looking at my shoulders .
don't .
focus on my waist .
ok?
my waist .
all right , try it again .
go on .
that's good .
remember , i'm your teacher .
you wanna learn how to surf?
you sure you wanna do this?
absolutely .
lamaze class , great place to meet girls .
ok , denise , slide over .
oh , no , no , no .
is this some kind of sick , twisted joke?
no , i'm combining denise's driving lesson with your ride to the beach .
we took driver training with denise .
call us a cab .
get your grisly butts in the car .
man , let me drive .
i'm going for my license next week .
chainsaw , you've been drinking .
no , it's cough medicine .
check out this phlegm .
save the phlegm .
you're not driving anywhere .
i'll tell you something .
you know why so many drunk drivers get in wrecks?
they don't learn to drive drunk .
alcohol kills brain cells .
you lose one more , you're a talking monkey .
come on , get in .
come on .
ok , denise , start her up .
signal left .
pull on out .
can i call my folks and say i won't be home ... ever?
i'm not used to this car .
i think it's safe .
move it out .
nice and smooth .
oh , yeah , that's ...
fine .
good .
why did you do that?
a car was coming .
well , it'll happen from time to time .
come on , denise , he won't bother us .
we just got lapped by an old lady with a walker .
see that space between those cars?
yeah .
pull in .
parallel park?
that's my weak spot .
listen to her .
ok .
i'm sober now .
that's good for today .
we live !
we live !
it's beautiful .
enough safe and sane .
it's time for dumb and dangerous .
these are mexican .
you do not know what's in these babies .
hey , get me a brew .
coming through .
anna maria , as far as we know , this has never , ever been attempted .
anna maria , we dedicate these cantaloupe to you .
you make fruit bombs for me?
oh , how sweet .
melon balls , coming up !
we're gonna make these babies fly !
excuse me .
excuse me .
excuse me .
you're awake .
i wanna talk .
not now , babe , i'm late .
late for what?
what's it like being pregnant?
bizarre .
yeah , that's what i thought .
my body is out of control and it's big and ugly .
i think you look great .
sure , in the dark .
how much longer?
about five weeks .
it's gonna be amazing .
yeah , i know .
you'll be a mother .
yeah .
eakian , this party's getting weak .
do something wild .
take all your clothes off .
why?
you want everyone to go home?
you're almost fun tonight .
almost .
you all right?
yeah .
come on in .
i'm just resting up .
too much fun .
it's all sewn .
hey , thanks .
that's great .
i feel so at home here .
yeah , me too .
yeah .
the grunion are running tonight .
in the dead of night , under a full moon , thousands of horny little fish swim hundreds of miles to ball their brains out in the sand .
it's so romantic .
you ever do that with one of your students?
no .
i swim hundreds of miles , i'm ready for a nap .
who's that?
oh , it's kim .
she's sort of my girlfriend .
" sort of "?
well , she's in hawaii .
so you're all alone and you like young girls .
kim's not that young .
she's 21 .
i'm 16 .
and you should consider that .
because there's , like , no difference between 21 and 16 now , but when she's 66 , i'll only be 61 .
and i'll be 75 and it won't matter anyway .
yeah .
come on , pam .
time for more fun .
wondermutt !
out of my way !
watch your ass , folks !
banzai !
oh , shit .
fire !
do something !
jesus christ , my couch is on fire !
come on , dave .
what?
what?
what?
all right , we took care of it .
my fish !
how many were there?
one .
poor fishy .
get rid of that couch .
that is a definite fire hazard .
definitely .
party's over .
it was just getting good .
we got a fire ...
good night !
one little fire .
big deal .
minors drinking on the beach .
seriously , we never do this .
boy , never , ever .
there's our english teacher , let's ask him .
mr. shoop , sir , could you come here just a moment , please?
hey , guys .
hi .
what's up?
found these boys with alcohol .
that alcohol , officer?
oh , that's not theirs .
whose is it?
it's mine .
see , i live in that house right there and they were just watching my stuff .
that's right .
it's his .
we should never have taken those little baby sips .
that was wrong .
god , so very , very wrong .
i think they learned one hell of a lesson , officer .
next time you boys encounter alcohol , remember you're underage .
yes , sir , we will .
yeah , of course , thank ...
thank you .
well , we're off to do our homework .
yeah .
thank you .
bye .
we shouldn't have tried this .
it was a mistake .
that was bad .
we should've just said no .
you guys are good men .
thank you .
thank you .
you're under arrest for contributing to the delinquency of a minor .
officer , that's not really my vodka .
is that your dog?
yeah .
no dogs on the beach , $50 fine .
he's not really my dog .
he just thinks he's my dog .
no , he's a neighborhood dog .
he hangs out at my place because there's garbage there .
he's a scavenger .
he'll eat anything .
he's a beach dog , really .
go away , beach dog .
do you have a cell for beginners?
boogie boy .
bunk in here .
moondoggie .
yeah .
who wants gum?
leave your message after the beep .
robin , it's your pal , shoop .
i can't leave my number because i'm downtown in jail .
jail?
what , you're surprised?
i got arrested in my swim trunks , so i need 50 bucks and a pair of shoes .
listen , please don't mention this to that bite in the ass gills .
you're an angel .
dinner , dancing , paris ...
hello , mr. shoop .
who is this?
the bite in the ass .
when i say " bite in the ass " , i mean that in the nicest possible way .
can i talk to robin?
i'm afraid robin and i are on our way out of town .
but don't worry , we'll be right over .
he's still a human being , phillip .
we have a very long drive .
if we go downtown now , we'll be stuck in traffic .
and that's ok with me , we'll be stuck in traffic .
and that's ok with me , because we'll be helping shoop and you won't think i'm a shit .
right?
am i in really big trouble?
arrested for contributing to the delinquency of minors?
you're not a hero .
what is this?
i made a new friend .
mr. shoop , i do hope we can get you out of this ugly mess .
and it is ugly .
mr. shoop's been making a lot of progress in his class , phillip .
it's true .
i've been handing out assignments and the kids turn them in .
it's almost like school in there .
i've heard .
and i'm proud .
confirms all my instincts about him .
he's my boy .
robin , let's get out of here .
we're on our way to wine country .
you kids have fun .
see those waves , wondermutt?
they're from hawaii .
kim's in hawaii .
robin's in the wine country .
you know what we need?
i mean , besides bread .
we need a woman who will appreciate what we have to offer .
a woman of culture ... ... intellect .
shake those buns , baby !
bring those buns over here .
mama's got some software for you , baby .
excuse me .
i'm with playgirl magazine .
survey me later , i'm trying to concentrate .
come on , baby .
thanks for your time .
shoot them buns over here .
hey !
hey , cowboy !
don't i know you?
hey , back off , hair bag , this is ladies 'night .
i love him , i love him , i love him .
larry !
mr. shoop .
what are you doing here?
what am i doing here?
you do this every night?
well , we have mondays off .
listen , man , you can't tell anybody , ok?
they think i'm 21 .
you were fabulous .
this is from both of us .
i'm in the wrong business .
but about school , if you could sneak in a couple hours 'sleep , you'd catch up .
mr. shoop , man , think about what you're saying .
i mean , if you could be 17 again , only you knew then what you know now .
yeah .
well , i know .
i hate that kid .
who we admire most in the world and why .
the person we admire most in the world is makeup artist
and creature creator rick baker .
his wonderfully gruesome slime bladders and slobber tubes
in american werewolf in london won him a richly deserved oscar .
that is why we admire makeup artist and creature creator rick baker
very , very , very , very , very , very ...
very , very , very , very , very ...
very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very ...
very , very , very , very , very much .
it's 100 words on the nose .
you can count if you want .
it is not easy to pick the person i admire most .
i admire people for different reasons .
the way they surf or teach english from the heart or help the homeless .
to pick one person is so unfair to everyone else .
isn't there enough pain in the world?
since there's no one i admire most , this is about a person i admire least , my ex boyfriend , andre .
if he tells you he broke up with me , he's lying , because i told him to get out of my face first .
you know how i could tell when he's lying?
his lips move .
i'm serious .
he's so in love with himself , he ought to be dating a mirror .
he's in skin tight leather pants , thinking he's rick james 'little brother .
give the world a break .
denise , can i have your paper?
no .
no?
well , i had to memorize my essay due to the fact i was mugged by a gang
looking for money and homework .
that happens .
ok , gang , mark your calendars .
field trip next monday .
where are we going , cockfights?
courthouse .
your teacher was arrested for giving vodka to some kids .
you and dave won't want to miss it .
you went to jail for us?
on roller skates .
thanks , man .
pam?
hi .
what are you doing here?
remember i said i'd tell you my wish when the time was right?
it's right .
your wish is to move in with me?
i'm a great cook .
i won't get in your way .
you know we connect .
pam , look , my place is very small .
it's perfect .
look , tommy , that's my brother , he had another kid and angela , she's his wife , wants to move the twins back into gail's room and put sally in the den , so i lose the couch .
yeah , well , my couch is barbecued .
the floor is fine .
mr. shoop , everybody else got their wish .
ok , pam .
if i let you stay here , it's only temporary until you find another place , ok?
i can stay .
who are you talking to?
this is tommy and angela and gail and sally and sly and the twins , chuck and bob , and tommy , jr .
this is mr. shoop .
how are you?
pleased to meet you .
she screams so well .
oh , don't be a wuss .
shut up !
run , run .
larry !
larry , wake up , you're missing this .
larry's not missing a thing .
let him sleep .
there he is .
leatherface , leatherface .
oh , no .
that's not a real person .
it's a stuntman .
ok , now , this ...
this right here isn't gonna bother him , because he's insane , ok?
good lord .
what are you watching?
do the dance .
a new film from the district , safe use of power tools .
delivery .
i don't want to know what this is , do i?
no , probably not .
come on .
what a finish , ladies and gentlemen .
it was great .
what did you think of that?
god , it was really american .
american , yes .
it's an american masterpiece .
talk about gutsy endings .
the girl gets away and our hero , leatherface , chainsaws his legs .
two thumbs up .
make that four for gore .
dear mr. francis gremp , thank you for informing us
of your problem with our cool dude sunglasses .
it worked .
please accept these cool dudes with our compliments .
all right , it's christmastime .
free glasses .
are these free?
yes .
we know you'll find them well constructed
and we hope your organization will see no need to boycott .
sincerely , wayne appleton , president , cool dude , inc .
all right , the power of the pen .
hey , thanks , chainsaw .
hey , eakian .
eakian .
man , you think you can help me with my letter , make it sound official?
sure , denise .
you wanna give it to me?
ok , tonight , for homework , write a review of texas chainsaw massacre .
rhonda?
if you're not doing anything tomorrow , i thought we could do something .
oh , i have lamaze class tomorrow night .
do you wanna go with me?
what about mr. shoop?
oh , he won't care .
i mean , if you don't mind being my coach .
i wouldn't mind at all .
great .
great .
see you , eak .
mr. shoop ... ... you should see this , but you can't let denise know i showed you .
ok?
ok .
shoop , this girl's dyslexic .
what?
that's not in her file .
this is serious .
you gotta get her some help .
how could she get this far with no one finding out?
she slipped through the system .
what happens when she gets out in the real world?
wait !
is this the same guy that took his english class to the petting zoo?
how'd you get those kids to work?
bribed them .
what would it take to have dinner with you?
that would be very expensive .
i'm having dinner with gills .
big phil again , huh?
robin , be honest , isn't he a bite in the ass?
no , he's not a bite in the ass .
he happens to be very ... ... articulate ... cultured ... ... extraordinarily tidy .
tall , dark and tidy .
that's a magic combination .
you're not in love .
none of your business .
sure , it is .
no .
tell me you love him , i'll stop asking you out .
how am i gonna tell you i love him when it's so new?
i knew it .
see , robin , he is not the guy for you .
you need an intelligent , sensitive man who can skate .
do you know such a guy?
oh , they're hard to find .
but now that i know , i'll keep my eye out .
would you?
looking good , denise .
good luck .
sir , you are really gonna earn your money today .
francis gremp?
call me chainsaw .
you're up next .
can you hold on a sec?
dad's late .
he's so irresponsible .
i said , " dad , 3 : 00 sharp . " but no , it's just in one ear , out the other .
i need your car .
you wanna use my car?
i'm under adult supervision .
chainsaw , you take your test and you bring my car right back here to me .
you make me proud to be an american .
dave , kiss this man .
you , come with me .
no , no , you stay there .
i'll bring the car to you .
can you back this up?
i'm taking a test .
just move all the way back .
what?
what'd i do?
don't worry about me .
see those cars on the right?
go ahead and park in between .
what do you mean?
you mean parallel park?
something wrong?
no , nothing .
yeah .
we going on the freeway?
i think we'll just stay in the neighborhood .
why are you driving with only one hand?
oh , this hand's gotta be free to put around the babes .
are you marking me off for that?
watch the dip !
that dip?
hey , you crazy?
don't you ever , ever yell at the driver !
do you hear me?
where are you going?
back .
the test is over .
no way !
that was your fault .
this is bullshit .
come on .
i stayed sober for this .
you can't do this .
come back , you dumb dildo .
wait , no , you're not a dildo .
i was joking .
that was a joke .
come on , be cool .
one more chance?
wait .
you lost points for driving too slow and not accepting the right of way .
failed again .
70 is passing .
seventy two .
i passed?
you passed .
i passed !
oh , i passed !
i passed !
shoop , i passed !
i passed !
i passed !
god , i passed !
thanks !
i'm proud of you .
congratulations .
i couldn't have done it without you .
now , you drove the car .
look , i owe you one , all right?
yeah?
yeah .
ok .
tell you something you can do for me .
what?
get help with reading .
man .
listen , denise .
what you have is a learning disorder called dyslexia .
you need to retrain your brain to deal with information .
there's a specialist .
i'm doing fine .
yeah , you are .
but you could be doing so much better .
but that's up to you .
hey .
think about it , ok?
ok , free film .
free developing .
come on , what more could you want?
here .
look , my dad's a butcher .
you like veal cutlets from minnesota?
milk fed .
hi , honey , how was your day?
hectic .
boy , something smells good .
the manicotti .
perfect timing .
why don't you start on the cheese and crackers .
yeah .
it's open .
hi .
hey .
i just brought this ray bradbury book .
maybe i should come back later .
why?
hi , miss bishop .
hi .
oh , robin , pam house , one of my students .
pam , robin bishop .
hi .
hi , pam .
freddy , i didn't make enough for three .
if you plan on inviting company ,
i wish you'd let me know .
no , he wasn't .
i stopped by to help him with a lesson .
but we can do that in the morning .
morning's much better .
i'll make french toast for us .
do you like french toast?
i bet she makes great french toast .
i actually meant morning at school .
oh , fine .
it was nice to meet you , pam .
you too .
robin?
i know this is none of my business , but what the hell is going on in there?
there's nothing going on in there .
remember those bribes?
well , pam needed a place to stay .
how long has she been here?
a couple of days .
my laundry's never smelled so good .
here , take a whiff .
oh , i'm sure it's april fresh .
i just hope having a maid is worth the damage you could do to that young girl .
see you tomorrow .
all ready .
great .
french or italian?
french .
i knew it .
pam , we gotta talk .
sure .
what's up?
i think you are a great girl .
and i think you're a great guy .
god , this is hard .
freddy , go ahead .
you can tell me anything .
ok .
you know how , when you're on your board , and you see the perfect wave rolling in and you think you got it?
only , something happens and you don't get it .
i mean , the key to the whole thing is timing .
if you're even a little out of sync , you're grim , you're blowing the barrel , you're seaweed .
but then you look outside and you see an even more perfect wave than the first perfect wave and that's the one you catch .
do you know what i mean?
yeah .
yeah , i get it .
surfing metaphors .
you're the perfect wave and i'm seaweed
and if you want me out , just say it .
no , no , i'm not the perfect wave .
and it's not just that i want you out of my house .
no , you want me out of your life .
pam , look , i'm your teacher .
no .
any time one person lets themself care deeply about another person , that person runs the risk of being rejected and destroyed .
i'll go get my things .
no , wait .
you cooked dinner .
it looks beautiful .
let's sit down , eat .
it's just food .
ok .
i'm gonna collect your book reports .
then we are on our way to court .
homework , pam?
you expect me to relate to the written word after the hell you put me through?
talk about shallow .
i've stepped in deeper puddles .
you're excused .
mr. shoop , don't you want mine?
larry , you're awake , with homework .
what's wrong with you?
i got fired .
they found out my real age .
hey , i didn't say a word .
no , my mom came to a show .
your mother?
it was a nightmare .
i mean , before she knew who i was , she put 5 bucks in my g string .
and then my aunt edna , she kisses me .
with tongue .
and rips off my mask .
mom freaked out .
she made me put on her coat .
i'm sorry .
you're sorry?
i'm at my sexual peak .
once a guy hits 18 , it's all downhill .
but it's a lovely ride .
mr. shoop , why did you tell the arresting officers that the vodka found in the possession of mr. gremp and mr. frazier belonged to you?
your honor , to keep a couple of students out of trouble .
david and francis have enough problems as it is .
it's true , your honor .
our lives are a mess .
guys , don't help .
where did you young men obtain the vodka in question?
from murray .
who's murray?
you know murray .
everybody knows murray .
from murray's liquor .
didn't this murray ask to see proof of age?
well , i come off pretty mature .
did you show him proof of age?
yeah , i guess i did .
may i see it , please?
i'd rather you didn't .
i'd rather i did .
you were a black marine in 1968?
vietnam .
a war puts a man through many , many changes .
young man , the possession of false identification and of alcohol by a minor are serious crimes .
you've just confessed to both of them .
i didn't mean to .
however , since the arresting officers
let you off with a warning , i'll probably do the same .
is this guy bitchen or what?
now , mr. shoop ...
your honor?
my name is robin elizabeth bishop and i'm also on the faculty with the defendant .
i submit that this man went to jail for his students .
very few teachers ever exhibit that degree of dedication .
therefore , your honor , i move that ...
don't move , miss bishop .
you're out of order .
and you're also correct .
mr. shoop , these charges will be dropped .
case dismissed .
all right !
all right !
that's so ...
shoop !
let me tell you something .
the judge bought that dedicated teacher crap , but you covered up , thus condoning student drinking .
i am filing a report for kelban with the entire story .
face it .
the test scores won't save you , because they're losers , just like you !
hi .
i was just congratulating our good friend mr. shoop .
now , about lunch , sweetheart .
tell you what , sweetheart , why don't you go ahead , order two lunches and eat them yourself .
one for each face .
ok .
today we take a practice test .
pinpoint each of your weak spots .
then we work a couple hours after school .
wait , wait .
practice tests , extra class time?
not in the contract .
eakian , get him .
the test is in two weeks .
you need the extra work .
then i'm afraid we're gonna need some extra incentive .
yeah .
like a party with a band .
i could use some wheels bad .
and get me a job , man , doing strip o grams .
i don't believe this greed .
believe it , man .
i need a houseboy .
it's a simple matter of renegotiating our contracts .
renegotiate?
who do you think you are , teamsters?
yeah , teamsters !
strike !
strike !
strike !
strike !
look !
for the past four weeks , i have given up all of my free time .
had my body used for a tackling dummy , my house trashed , my couch set on fire , my goldfish murdered , my butt thrown in jail and my car wrecked .
all i'm asking for is a little extra effort .
you know , what's sad is you guys could all pass that test .
but you're just so happy being failures that you just don't know ...
why am i doing this?
tell you what .
you guys drop out and be illiterate .
i'm going to hawaii and be tan .
have a cow .
damn .
hey .
thanks for the help .
good luck .
where are you going?
to quit .
you can't quit .
sure , i can .
i never got through to anybody .
not true .
they were learning .
you're not a quitter .
i am .
i turned you down for dinner at least a dozen times
and you haven't quit bugging me .
wanna go out to dinner tonight?
can't .
see?
everybody take a seat .
you , in the cot , out of bed .
where's mr. shoop?
he has tendered his resignation .
now , sit down .
would someone tell me what mr. shoop had planned for today?
yes?
group sex .
no , that's tomorrow .
today's independent study , right after our midmorning nap .
don't think you can pull this bs with me .
everybody take their textbooks out and turn to chapter seven .
read it again .
who's making that noise?
what noise?
i don't hear any noise .
what , you got dog ears?
chainsaw , stop doing that .
stop doing what?
you know , i hear it too and it's annoying .
find the hooligan that's responsible , because i am trying to read chapter seven .
again .
mr. gills , i cannot study .
i'm going to the library .
chainsaw , sit down .
you can hum till your lips fall off , i could care less .
wait a minute .
you're not dismissed .
now , i promise you , you people act like psychopaths tomorrow
and you will be sorry .
we will be sorry?
mr. gills sure does know his child psychology .
miss cura , i want to let you know that the children are a little hyperactive , but i'm sure that you'll enjoy their joie de vivre .
so far , i've only subbed at grammar schools , so this should be a nice change .
help , mr. gills !
denise !
denise !
take it easy !
what happened?
don't go in there without a gun .
it's terrible .
is this my classroom?
yes , it is .
whose blood is that?
is that your blood?
no .
my god .
we're back !
what is wrong with you people?
it's like you said , gills !
we're psychopaths !
somebody better call the school nurse !
i am not amused !
turn off those motors !
everybody get up .
now !
i'm not ready for high school .
why'd she leave?
didn't she like us?
where's her sense of humor?
i have seen some sick things before .
but this ...
this is ...
devilishly clever .
vomitous !
thank you .
we take a lot of pride in our work .
look , we want shoop back .
why would shoop come back?
so kelban can fire him?
he might surprise you .
we did today .
and we've got more for tomorrow .
do we have a deal?
wondermutt , i do not want to play .
not now .
i'm busy .
tough day?
we've been torturing gills .
yeah .
he said you could have your job back .
now , why would i want my job back?
hey , my life is sailing .
i got a radio , blanket , beach chair , dark glasses , dog .
why would i wanna go back?
how about we can't pass that test without you?
me and chainsaw , we been sober for two days , four hours and 15 minutes .
no kidding?
swear to god .
reality is so unreal .
but a nice change .
truly .
thumbs up .
i think you should know that you were a phase .
i've outgrown you .
but i do wanna be friends , if you can handle it .
and shoop ... ... i'm seeing that reading specialist this afternoon .
look .
we'll study in school , after school , whatever it takes .
but we need a teacher .
what do you say , mr. shoop?
please?
how can i say no to these cute little faces?
your practice test scores were great .
hey , come on , you been here 12 hours .
i want you to go home , forget about this test , get a good night's sleep .

bad news?
gills says he's mailing you your scores .
we failed .
he just said the average grade
was below passing .
so we failed .
hey , you didn't fail .
i failed .
field trips to the beach , a bed in your classroom , drinking at the beach , a screening of texas chainsaw massacre 1 .
quite a summer , mr. shoop .
i tried to keep it interesting .
i have his dismissal ready for your signature , sir .
before i sign anything ,
i understand there are some people waiting to speak in mr. shoop's behalf .
really?
come in .
mr. kelban , you're not actually going to listen to these delinquents?
no .
i'm gonna listen to their parents .
i'm principal kelban .
is there a spokesperson here?
i guess i am .
i'm howard gremp .
you're chainsaw's father .
interesting boy .
no , you can say it .
he's a lunatic .
dad .
you know , six weeks ago , i thought he had the iq of a salad bar .
his only interest in life was to make people sick .
if my mother came to dinner , he would give the dog a third eye or an extra leg .
because of him , we stopped having kids .
i mean , you can imagine the feeling when i saw him studying .
the wife and i almost burst into tears .
david was doing his homework too .
it makes sense , they share the same brain .
not only did mr. shoop get my daughter to read , he taught her to drive .
he showed kevin there's more to life than just football .
i'm not sure i agree , but it's possible .
this man should not be teaching .
proof is here in these test results .
look for yourself , mr. shoop .
passing is 70 .
average score here was 63 .
they failed .
that is not true , mr. gills .
we passed?
no , not all of you .
but that's not what's important here .
larry .
went from an 18 to a 51 !
if i'd only seen you strip a week sooner .
you !
mom , my hair .
rhonda .
from a 29 to a 43 and she gave birth .
isn't childbirth grounds for a makeup test?
it always has been .
this woman thing never fails .
eakian .
a 51 to a 74 .
i passed !
i am an eakian , grams .
all right , eaker .
denise .
no previous test score because you ditched every test , but a 38 .
honey , that's terrific .
we'll get them next time .
kevin .
yeah?
from a 48 to a 75 !
yeah !
i'm back on the team !
yeah !
kill !
yeah !
kill !
chainsaw .
last score was a 6 .
this time , 59 .
monster comeback .
all right .
and dave .
from a 26 to a 70 .
i passed !
you made it !
you passed?
you passed and i failed , asshole !
how could you do that to me?
it was an accident .
i'll take it again .
i can fail , i know it .
and pam went from a 53 to an 82 .
was that the highest?
well , almost .
i mean , that guy who spent six weeks in the bathroom got a 91 .
but look , there's more going on here than test scores and grades .
you all worked hard and you improved .
and that's very nice , mr. shoop .
we are here to discuss his flagrant violation of school policies .
hold it , gills .
according to my numbers , the average scores here increased from 28 to 63 .
that's 125 percent improvement .
now , that's teaching .
absolutely .
yeah .
mr. shoop , i'm granting you tenure .
he's back , ladies and gentlemen !
this is the last time i ask .
i promise .
will you have dinner with me?
i'll think about it .
can i use some of that lip stuff?
does this mean we can have dinner tonight?
i didn't say that .
we'll just talk about it over breakfast . >> napisy pobrane z http : // napisy . org << >>>>>>>> nowa wizja napisw <<<<<<<<
