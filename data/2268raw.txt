hey , guys hey
honey , i got us that room at the woodford inn this weekend .
that place in vermont?
you can take a hint !
wait , you can't go away this weekend .
it's emma's birthday .
yeah !
we're having a party .
can't you just have the party when we get back?
no , that's silly .
that won't be her real birthday .
gee , if only she were one and had no idea what the hell the birthday was .
come on , you guys .
this is really important to us .
oh , i'm sorry but chandler and i could really use a weekend away .
you know , to reconnect ..... emotionally .
there's this thing i really want us to do .
i read about it in maxim .
what?
can't you just go to vermont the next day?
yeah , we want everyone to be there
as much as i hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister .
and i mean , you know , you guys , this is a big deal .
i mean , how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle?
alright , we'll stay .
we can just drive up after the party .
fine but if we end up not doing this maxim thing because of this party ...
believe me that is not why we won't be doing that .
friends 10x04 tow the cake
you know pheebs .
when i was little , on my birthday , my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house , and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find them all .
oh ... i love family traditions like that .
when , uh , when ursula and i were kids , on our birthday , our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food .
hey you guys hi
hey i brought the camera for emma's video .
oh , good , good !
we have this idea to make a birthday video for emma and we'll give it to her when she's 18 .
oh , cool !
wow !
it's like a time capsule .
yeah
oh , just think !
she's gonna be watching that video on a tv that hasn't even been invented yet .
with friends who right now are just like babies
and they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people .
that's the hope !
so is , uh , emma awake yet?
oh no , it's still nap time but she'll be up soon .
ah , where's joey?
i said it's still nap time .
hey , there's uncle joey .
hey
hey , say something to emma on her 18th birthday .
18 , huh?
joey , no !
what?
what?
it's for her hot friends .
when they see this , you'll be fifty two .
and starting to think about settling down !
hey joey , will you please set this up for people to put emma's presents on .
love to .
yeah .
we were supposed to bring presents?
yeah .
i wrote emma a song .
oh , yeah .
how was i supposed to know?
joey , it's a birthday party .
yeah but for a one year old .
what's the point?
the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup .
just , just a cup with a picture of elmo on it dressed as a farmer .
and he's standing next this cow .
the cow says " elmoooo
man ..
that's a funny cup .
hey hey
where's the birthday girl?
oh , she's still napping .
oh , sure .
she was probably up all night excited about the party she knows is happening .
look , i know that you guys really want to get to vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you .
but it really is to us .
okay?
emma will never have her first birthday again .
alright .
you're right .
we're sorry .
now let's wake up emma and get the fun time started !
no , really she didn't sleep well last night so we can't wake her up .
are you friggin 'kidding me , green?
hi hey
glad you came .
i can't believe emma's already one !
i remember your first birthday .
ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you .
he pulled on his testicles so hard we had to take him to the emergency room .
there's something you didn't know about your dad .
hey , hey , mr. and mrs. geller .
let me help you with that .
thank you .
oh , man .
this is great , huh?
three of us together again?
you know what would be fun?
if we gave this present to emma from all of us ...
which one are you?
i can't believe emma's still asleep .
i know !
what are we going to do?
i've got a plan .
i've got a plan .
i'm going to ram this platter really hard onto your ribs .
you're going to scream out and that will wake her up .
i'm not going to vermont with this monica .
hey , pheebs .
you know what?
i was thinking since you wrote a song maybe i could do somthing for emma using my talents .
so you're gonna ... hit on her?
no , no , no .
my talents as an actor .
you know , i could , like , maybe ...
i could do a dramatic reading of one of her books .
or you could stick a fork in an apple !
hey , i think emma might like it .
oh , emma might like what?
um ... my present .
oh , what did you get her?
actually we prepared performances .
well , separate performances .
but equally real .
oh , that sounds like fun !
well , you know what?
actually ...
people are getting a little antsy waiting for emma to wake up from her nap .
so would you mind performing them once now?
sure , yeah yeah?
o .... kay okay?
everybody , let's get this party started , huh?
joey and phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us .
oh , great !
aren't you gonna be embarrassed going up there? having nothing prepared?
hey , i do it every week with 3 cameras pointing at me and the whole crew waiting .
so joey , what are you gonna do for us?
uh ... i will be doing a dramatic reading of one of emma's books .
oh .
okay .
which one?
oh , well , it's , uh ...
one of her favorites .
riding the storm out : coping with postpartum depression .
yeeesh !
love you forever .
love you forever by robert munch . published by firefly books .
printed ... in mexico .
a mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth
back and forth .
back and forth .
and while she held him , she sang " i'll love you forever
i'll like you for always as long as i'm living my baby you'll be .
and while he rocked her , he sang
i'll love you forever .
i'll like you for always .
as long as i'm living , my baby you'll be .
wow !
that was amazing .
thank you so much for that gift .
i was not ready for this today .
amazing , amazing .
oh , phoebe .
i'm sorry .
phoebe has prepared something as well .
that's right .
i prepared a song for emma .
from my heart to hers .
for there's no greater gift than the gift of music .
emma !
your name poses a dilemma
cause not much else rhymes with emma
maybe the actor richard crenna
he played the commanding officer in rambo
happy birthday , emma
is that it?
no , of course not .
no , no , i've also , you know , prepared a reading .
sex and the single mother .
finding your g spot .
no !
hello emma .
happy 18th birthday .
right now that seems so far away .
seventeen years .
yes .
you'll be all grown up by then and we'll be ...
well , your grandfather and i might not be here .
that's true .
this message could be coming to you from beyond the grave , emma .
after all , my parents died very young .
and my cholesterol's off the charts !
remember , emma .
heart disease kills women , too .
okay , cut !
great , great .
that was , that was just ... yeah .
ross , um , don't forget to get a shot of emma's cake .
it's in a box in the fridge .
okay , sure .
oh , you're gonna love this cake .
i got it from a bakery in new jersey , carino's .
oh my god .
that place has the creamiest frosting .
i used to hitchhike there when i was a kid .
well , anyway .
they make these great novelty cakes in all different shapes and if you give them a photo they'll copy it in icinig .
oh , did you do a picture of emma?
yes , on a cake shaped like a bunny .
oh , rach .
does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes?
say , for bachelorette parties?
ross , what are you talking ...
oh , my god !
they put my baby's face on a penis !
oh , now it's a party !
you guys , this isn't funny .
alright?
if i wanted this cake to be a disaster , i would've baked it myself !
uh .... is it okay that i still think it looks delicious?
jack , look at this .
i know what you're thinking , judy .
the resemblance is uncanny .
i am this close to tugging on my testicles again .
no , no , this is not what i ordered .
okay?
i went all the way to new jersey so that i could have the perfect cake for my daughter's birthday and i need a bunny cake right now !
ask him if it will be faster if we cut the baby's face off the penis so we could put it on the bunny .
that is a weird sentence .
oh , believe you me ,
i am going to bring this cake back .
i don't even want it in my home .
joey , don't touch it !
i'm so confused !
yes , yes , i still want my daughter's picture but on a bunny cake
yellow cake , chocolate frosting with nuts !
to be fair , this one does have nuts .
hey , mon .
it was really nice of you to loan rachel your car so she could go get the cake .
it was so nice of her to pull my hair till i dropped the key .
well , you know , while we're waiting , you guys could tape your message to emma for her 18th birthday , huh?
okay .
hi emma .
it's the year 2020 .
are you still enjoying your nap?
we're aunt monica and uncle chandler by the way .
you may not recognize us because we haven't spoken to your parents since 17 years !
we used to be married but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled because of you .
happy birthday .
ross , rachel promised it would be over by now .
we seriously have to go if we want to get to vermont .
i called them .
the last train leaves in a half hour .
and you know , i have a massage client soon .
you guys , just please .
a little bit longer
i promise rachel will be back with the cake any minute .
monica , rememeber the frosting?
huh?
alright , five more minutes .
hello .
oh no , what happened?
what?
okay .
okay .
where are you?
okay , i'll be right there .
was that emma?
is she up?
rachel got pulled over for speeding .
she forgot her license so now i have to bring it to her .
well , if you're leaving i'm definitely gonna go .
wait !
if anybody gets to go , it's us .
we've been complaining the longest .
wait , you guys .
no , no .
you can't leave .
rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up .
how do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all of you guys are gone?
i don't know .
you'll tell us on monday .
joey , you're in charge , okay?
you make sure nobody leave .
got it !
hey , hey , hey .
where do you think you're going?
to the bathroom .
alright , well , the rest of you get comfortable , okay?
because we're gonna be here for a .....
wait a minute .
there's a window in there .
oh , no !
he's not getting away that easy .
what are you doing?
get the hell out of here !
that one did not have emma's face on it .
um , no , it did not .
well , we'd better get going .
it's late .
jack's not allowed to drive at night anymore .
he has trouble staying in his lane .
last winter i went up on a church lawn and drove right through a manger scene .
the papers thought that it was a hate crime .
anyway , it was lovely seeing you .
okay bye .
bye dear .
nighty night nighty night
joey , how could you just let them leave?
hey , hey , hey .
i'm not gonna mess with jack .
he's a great man .
he fought for our country .
no , he didn't .
he pretended to be a quaker to get out of korea .
huh !
well , that's it .
he's the last one to go .
i'm locking you guys in .
you do know i can just turn them the other way around .
right?
oh , forgot you used to live here .
hello .
joey , it's estelle .
hey .
so how did your audition go today?
what audition?
the one i told you about last week .
what?
you never said anything about an audition .
let me start over .
i just got a call about an audition .
i think you can still make it .
it's down at the aster theater and you need to have a monologue prepared .
a monologue?
i don't have a ....
i got it .
uh , so , i'm gonna take off .
what?
no way !
you don't get to leave .
i've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute .
yeah , and we paid for a room that we're supposed to be in right now .
well , okay , now .
only one of us has to stay with emma .
okay and as the person who realized that i get to go .
no , no, no , no , no .
let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying .
oh !
i got it .
okay , everyone pick a number from one to ten , alright?
whoever gets the highest number gets to go first .
okay , ten .
okay .
monica picks ten and i call nine .
anyone else?
no , let's just , let's just draw straws .
or we could flip a coin and then multiply the ...
i'm beggin you to stop .
alright .
ok , how about this?
we got wind up toys for emma for her birthday .
we can make them race and whoever comes in last stays .
yeah , let's do that !
that sounds more fun than the thing we're gonna do in vermont !
everybody , pick the toys !
okay .
i want the dolphin !
that's a bear .
i'm too excited !
okay , phoebe , you get the bear .
joey , you get the robot .
and chandler and i get the dog .
okay?
and the race is going to go from here to here .
now the one who comes in last .... stays !
okay , ladies and gentlemen , wind your toys .
on your mark , get set .... go !
go , go !
come on , robot !
what are you barking at?
how is that going to help?
i bought you !
how did i forget that that's all you do?
way to go , robot !
good job , alan !
hey , good race , you guys yes .
see you later .
no , no , no , wait .
we didn't lose .
the rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser .
well , our dog never crossed the finish line so technically ....
they left .
no , there's no time to go to bakery .
we're just gonna come home .
everybody left?
alright , well , just tell emma that we'll be there as soon as we can .
bye .
rachel !
no !
god , sorry .
i can't believe they gave you a ticket .
you're such a good driver .
emma's awake .
yeah?
i can't believe this .
this is her first birthday .
she's awake .
we're not even there .
everybody left .
we still have the stupid obscene cake .
well , maybe i can fix that .
you know?
try to , try to turn it into something else .
oh , don't even bother .
i've already ruined her first birthday .
do you know how important these early experiences are , ross?
very .
according to the back cover of that book you gave me .
rach , she's not gonna remember this .
i guess .
oh , i just had such an idea what this day would be like .
you know?
emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing happy birthday .
then we would all go into the ...
hey , get off the road , you stupid student driver !
they have to learn !
hey , this isn't that bad .
oh my god !
look , you made it into a bunny !
how did you do that?
well , i just made these two things , um, cheeks .
and then i split this to make ears .
wel ,, i'm very impressed .
some can sing .
some can dance .
i apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures
another way to organize your stuffed animals is by size .
i'm sorry .
is this a game for emma or for monica?
game?
emma , do you even know it's your birthday today?
you're one .
one year old .
that's little .
huh !
that's my girl !
that's how old you are .
did i teach her that?
did i just impart wisdom?
i want one .
me too .
there's no one around .
why don't we just take this one?
and head to canada .
i was kidding .
i wasn't !
let's get going !
hey .
are ross and rachel back?
no , not yet .
oh good !
i didn't miss the party .
what about your massage client?
i just felt so bad missing this so i just slipped him a little something .
you know , as long as i'm back in 5 or 6 hours , it will be alright .
okay , if ross and rachel ask , i've been here the whole time .
the whole time !
i've been here the whole time .
joey , we just saw you come in .
you ran past us on the stairs .
i don't care that you left .
i'm just glad that you're here .
thanks you guys .
hey guys , come on .
you've got to see what emma just did .
what?
emma , how old are you?
how old are you today?
oh , emma , that's right !
you're that many !
oh my god !
our daughter's a genius !
rach , this means ...
no , no science camp
damn it !
i'll put a candle on a cake .
oh , emma .
look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly .
thanks .
okay , here we go !
emma's first birthday cake .
hey emma , you want to blow out the cake?
come on , emma .
you can do it .
what's wrong?
are you okay?
oh , yeah , nothing .
it's happy tears .
this is just what i wanted .
hey , you made it into a bunny .
what is wrong with me? !
it looked more delicious when it was a penis !
okay okay , you ready?
yeah .
and ... record okay
hi emma .
well , your first birthday is over .
and it was weird ....
go , go , go , alan
