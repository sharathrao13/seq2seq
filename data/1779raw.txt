good evening , child .
evening , mama .
home already?
i'm so happy .
mama ...
not so fast .
please .
leave me be .
i'm tired .
i can quite believe it .
your last pupil left 3 hours ago .
might i know where you've been all this time?
please .
no , you don't .
not until you tell me !
no .
i went for a walk .
do you mind?
i spent 8 hours in my cage .
i was tired and needed some air .
for three hours?
absolutely !
magnificent .
just as i thought .
where's the bankbook?
10, 000 schillings !
tell me , have you lost your mind?
where's my grey autumn suit?
no idea .
give that back .
no .
no .
bitch !
i remember that talk show .
the guy advocated fines for dog owners whose dogs crap in the street .
bullshit .
the creep was defending the idea that women are inferior to men .
rubbish .
if you'd let me get a word in ...
who rattled your cage !
should cut your hands off .
beating your own mother !
that frock was far too gaudy anyway .
at your age , you should know what suits you .
can't you stop , you cow?
wasn't ruining that enough for you?
i wish ...
what?
you daren't say it?
don't bother .
i know what you wish .
i could have had a heart attack from the agitation .
if that's what you want , go ahead .
stop it , mama , you don't know what you're saying .
there's a real hole here .
here , too .
sorry .
but why do you do these things?
why do you do these things?
i'm sorry .
truly sorry .
let me look .
never mind that .
that's how it is .
we're a hot blooded family .
come on , stop crying .
i'll make some coffee .
we'll have a cup together .
okay?
nothing in life comes free .
you'll just have to give more private lessons .
your vanity must not stop us buying our apartment .
you can't contradict me there .
i paid this month's instalment long ago , don't worry .
in any case , the dress only cost 6, 500 .
i'll pay the remainder back in tomorrow .
i don't understand why someone of your standing slaps make up on and fritters money away on frocks that will soon be out of fashion .
i'd be wearing that dress for years .
the cut was so classical .
it was ageless .
if memory serves me right , you used to have a dress just like it .
remember?
you must be dreaming .
it was a designer label .
the finishing was remarkable .
it would have lasted forever .
do you still need the light?
did they really annoy you today?
no more than usual .
did you have the schober girl?
isn't friday her day?
well?
she's not untalented .
she has a surprising affinity for schubert .
schubert's your department , don't forget .
that's not for you to say .
you're hardly a judge of what is my department musically .
if you want your pupils to have a career instead of you ...
mama ...
no one must surpass you , my girl .
no mama .
don't be dizzy ...
erika .
don't worry , mama .
the plano teacher
a little less pedal wouldn't go amiss .
it's not enough just to take your foot off .
a note may not be as long as it is written and may not be marked as long as it should be held . from the novel by elfrlede jellnek
and two , and three and four ...
and one , and two , and three and four ...
and one , and two ...
dogs are barking ,
rattling their chains .
people are sleeping
in their beds .
do you have no ear for what coldness is?
or maybe you're just sloppy?
and let go .
and let go .
the music is not purely descriptive .
and it's not drenched in indifference and sentimentality .
and let go .
you see?
dogs are barking ,
rattling their chains .
people are sleeping
in their beds .
a wrong note in beethoven is better than bad interpretation .
you play only phrases .
ignore the structure and you'll ruin the sonata .
back to the top of the page .
i guessed you were for the recital .
allow me to introduce ...
professor , please , do come in .
hello , auntie .
and your mother .
good evening .
you've met my nephew?
i was about to introduce myself .
my name's walter klemmer .
at the risk of seeming prosaic , after sampling spiritual nourishment of such quality ,
i've organised , for the interval , a buffet to sustain the artists and , i hope , for your pleasure , too .
through here .
my husband's very particular ...
excuse me , auntie .
sorry to interrupt but i can't wait .
i hope it's not too forward of me to kiss the hand that plays such bach .
you can stop now .
where do you get such unfashionable enthusiasm?
i'm delighted the tradition of recitals lives on .
it was practically extinct .
the masters die , then their music .
people today only ever listen to pop or rock .
you're right .
families like this are no more .
generations of laryngologists toiled over beethoven's last quartets .
now , at best , academics stamp their feet in time to the trumpety trumps of bruckner .
disdaining bruckner is immature ,
mr ...
klemmer?
tell me , what enables you to talk about music so precociously?
your aunt said you studied ...
low voltage , professor .
low voltage .
it was made between 1620 and 1630 by marcel pichler .
from hallein .
a rare piece .
here .
it is played
like a cello .
its common name is leg viol or quinton .
recently , i found a painting that exactly shows this instrument .
not this type of instrument .
i mean , specifically this instrument .
the painting depicts a concert of viole da gamba at the court of duke augustus von braunschweig wolfenbuttel .
can i fetch you something?
not at all .
why?
it's fascinating .
look at them .
do they give a fig about the benefits of illness?
have you read adorno on schumann's fantasia in c major?
no .
he talks of his twilight .
it's not schumann bereft of reason , but just before .
a fraction before .
he knows he's losing his mind .
it torments him but he clings on , one last time .
it's being aware of what it means to lose oneself before being completely abandoned .
i'd say you are a good teacher .
thank you .
you talk about things as if they were yours .
it's rare .
and i think you know it .
schubert and schumann are my favourites , that's all .
since my father died completely mad in steinhof asylum ,
i can talk easily about the twilight of the mind , can't l?
if you'd really prefer not to eat , perhaps you'd care for a drink of something?
go ahead .
i had to sing for my supper .
dr. blonsky with his instrument fetish is such a bore .
honestly ,
klemmer , or whatever he's called , seems a bit of a leech?
walter studies at the engineering school .
but his musicality keeps up with technology , as you will understand when you listen to him play .
over to you , walter .
my uncle exaggerates shamelessly .
after the professor's performance , i feel doubly amateur .
i had intended to play for you schenberg's opus 33b , so that my wrong notes might go unnoticed .
not very funny , i know .
but a discussion of schubert and schumann's madness
left me deeply impressed .
i have decided to drop schenberg for my favourite piece by schubert : the scherzo from the sonata in a major .
... dreaming of what they don't have , replenished of good and bad .
and next morning , all flown away .
and here , the mood switches to irony .
d ...
d ...
d ...
so what?
so what?
they've had their pleasure .
d ...
d ...
d ...
that's the obstinacy of the complacent middle class .
and they hope that what they left behind
might be waiting for them on the pillows .
excuse me , professor .
can i have a word?
go ahead .
anna says you may not let her play in the jubilee concert .
i said a soloist needs more than talent .
she doesn't practice enough?
only she can tell .
she works 8 hours a day .
it's the end result that counts , not the hours .
for her , only music counts .
look at her .
schubert isn't a walk in the park .
i didn't say you wouldn't play .
we'll see how you gel with the singer .
excuse me , i have a rehearsal .
goodbye .
goodbye .
the professor is right .
without total commitment , you won't get anywhere .
wipe your nose .
what do you look like?
your mother wants you to call her .
i've only just arrived .
i don't know .
at least 3 hours .
no ! please mama ...
in that case , i'll take a taxi .
yes !
i'm not a baby .
i have to go now .
can we play the trill the same?
i'll start on the upper note .
yes !
sorry to disturb you .
what is it?
professor kohut?
what do you want?
at the conservatory , no one interrupts lessons .
i apologise .
i am very sorry but i wanted to come to you rather than ask just anybody .
about what?
the entrance exam .
i want to join your master class .
that's very flattering , young man .
i hope your interruption is not to arouse interest your talents don't merit .
application forms are available in the secretary's office .
first floor , door 11 .
please excuse us , we have work to do .
continue .
go on .
mr. klemmer !
hello ,
mr. walter klemmer?
that's correct .
please ...
your programme is particularly difficult .
where do you wish to begin?
wherever you prefer .
professor , it's your class that mr. klemmer wishes to join : which piece would you like to hear first? don't mind .
the first on the list .
go ahead .
well?
stunningly brilliant .
no , seriously , i think it wasn't too bad .
he just put " private lessons " .
that's even more remarkable .
i don't know how seriously he takes his engineering but for someone whose priority is not the piano , bravo .
it's amazing .
i quite agree .
he truly is very talented .
ladies?
gentlemen?
i vote for .
yes , me too .
no doubt about it .
what do you say?
your opinion counts most .
he's applying to join your class .
after such euphoria , it's hard to voice reservations .
i can't say i totally share your enthusiasm .
clearly he doesn't lack talent but i wonder , and i ask you , what does he expect from us?
for a professional career , he's too old .
by accepting him , we'll reject a more motivated student .
and , frankly , i find his histrionics suspicious or even unpleasant .
i don't see what you mean .
in the andantino , there were no histrionics , as you put it .
everyone knows our views on schubert diverge .
please , let's not waste time .
20 people are waiting .
i feel unable to nurture the artistic temperament or virtuosity of mr. klemmer .
dinner's ready !
coming , mama !
sit down , i'll bring the sauce .
can i switch off the tv?
if it bothers you .
don't you like that?
i'm tired .
you look it .
are the auditions so exhausting?
boring , rather .
that's tiring , too .
what's wrong with you?
what do you mean?
look .
is that why you're in a bad mood?
you might be more careful .
it's not very appetising .
mare on heat seeks ardent , successful stallion , for jumping and dressage .
must be 8 inches .
hello , mr. naprawnik .
hello , teacher
who's she?
my piano teacher .
don't pick out the inner voices so much .
do you know where the melody is?
it sounds as clear as a muddy windscreen .
probably due to the images lodged in your mind .
you have one approach for bach , beethoven and the others .
what made you want to study music?
your meagre talent?
i assure you it's not worth it .
take a job playing in a strip joint and stop wasting my time .
teacher ,
what?
i'm sorry .
what for?
for earlier ...
at the newsagents .
why?
why are you sorry?
what for?
it doesn't work like that .
sorry isn't enough , if i don't know why .
are you sorry because you're a pig?
or because your friends are pigs?
or because all women are bitches for making you a pig?
or just because you got caught?
the lesson is ended .
i propose your mother comes to see me .
maybe she can shed some light on this .
well?
what are you sorry for?
i'm listening .
the silence is deafening .
see you next time , along with your mother .
now , please remove yourself .
i'll need my break to recover .
goodbye .
yes !
this time i'm expected .
the break's not over yet .
and the lesson hasn't begun .
can i take out my scores while i'm waiting?
you know i voted against you?
no .
i don't believe you're serious about music but rather about the kudos it brings .
you know that's untrue .
and even if it were true , would it be such a shameful motive?
yes .
what have you brought?
you should forget schubert .
schenberg is all ...
i fought to win your attention .
give me a chance .
i know you're not as indifferent as you pretend .
i neglected my studies for you .
it's the truth !
you may think it's ridiculous , but since the recital at the blonskys ,
i've had you stuck in my mind like a nut on a bolt .
i apologise for being so technical .
i never intended to apply here .
stop lying , it won't wash .
i'm not lying .
for next time , find a copy of opus 19 .
let's talk first .
i can't see the point .
don't just stand there .
sit down and begin .
is this your last lesson?
please .
pretend you have a migraine or something .
it's lovely out .
either you play or my migraine will end this lesson .
it's bound to finish late .
today's our first mendelssohn rehearsal .
so , don't call up every 5 minutes .
it's embarrassing .
viora of the philharmonic's coming .
he'll think i'm a little girl .
is that clear?
if it ends late , take a taxi .
yes mama .
goodbye .
i adore lying in the name of love .
i'm so happy for you .
if she calls after 10 , don't answer .
is that okay?
it will be a pleasure .
good evening , this is mrs. kohut .
may i speak to my daughter?
what's wrong?
what the ...?
shit !
stay there !
stay there , cunt !
are you crazy or something?
your father died this afternoon .
above all , keep calm .
it's so inconsiderate of you !
think of the consequences !
kind of you to honour us with your presence .
might we know what kept you?
stop blubbing !
what happened?
i have diarrhoea .
are you scared or what?
a pianist needs solid nerves .
how can i perform after ...
don't overdo it .
we should be going up .
don't be so pathetic .
they won't bite .
it's a rehearsal .
did i overestimate you?
you think me devoid of sensitivity and indeed i can be superficial .
you see , i admit it .
but telling me to forget schubert was atrociously unfair .
it's quite the contrary .
there are days , like after our first lesson , when ...
the sight of blood makes me ill .
go to her .
be her brave protector .
what happened?
let me .
call a doctor .
don't stare , there's nothing to see .
go back to the hall .
come on .
wait .
why?
why?
stop it !
i told you to stop !
if you don't stop immediately , i'll leave .
erika ...
look at me , not your penis .
be quiet .
don't move or i'll leave .
no .
erika , i love you .
no one has ...
if you won't be quiet , you'll end up all alone here .
why do you hurt me?
i can't hold back .
i said , silence !
keep going .
come here .
that's it .
it's coming .
keep going .
don't stop !
i'll write down what you can do to me .
all my desires on paper for you to peruse at will .
you don't like that?
you can't leave me like this .
come on .
i've no desire to touch that now .
keep going , please .
out of the question !
hands off .
or we never see each other again .
it's totally sick what you're doing here .
and it hurts !
i sympathise .
stop it .
don't be stupid .
you're spoiling it .
i won't touch you again .
i want you to stay like that , that's all .
facing me !
don't put it away .
it's not me who's stupid .
it's you .
you should know what you can and can't do to a man .
you bitch !
shut up !
the playing field has to be level .
if you think ...
wait .
i won't move , i promise .
i won't say a word .
you will receive my instructions .
by letter .
or face to face .
or maybe over the phone .
now , you can put it away .
facing me .
how about a little smile?
go on .
don't be so serious , pretty lady .
go on .
next time , we'll do much better .
i promise .
practice will make you perfect .
at least 2 months , with no guarantee of complete recovery .
that's terrible .
and she really was quite good .
she has the nerve .
she played amazingly yesterday despite nearly not making it .
pull yourself together .
you're no use to anna if you break down like that .
for the moment , we must wait .
she mustn't neglect her left hand .
that's always her weak point .
also , she'll be scarred for life .
just imagine .
a pianist with a disfigured hand .
she's hardly attractive .
her only attribute was her talent .
that's why we sacrificed everything .
she sacrificed everything .
sorry?
you said we .
it's anna who sacrificed everything .
yes , naturally .
who would do such a thing?
the police say it must have been another student acting out of jealousy .
can you imagine it?
being so evil?
she's always been a loner .
she hardly has any friends .
they'll find the man who did it .
he deserves his hands chopping off .
my next lesson is waiting .
i'll have to ask you to leave .
tell anna she's welcome to drop in when she's better .
remind her about her left hand .
i'll tell her .
thank you very much .
she'll come by .
she admires you so much .
chin up , mrs. schober .
who will replace anna for the concert?
no one .
no student could at such short notice .
i've been asked to stand in for the singer's sake .
that's very good .
anna will be pleased .
goodbye teacher .
stop .
back to the beginning .
you gladly ignore the dynamics .
what does it say?
piano .
exactly .
and then?
forte piano .
and then?
pianissimo .
and diminuendo and mezzo forte , forte , fortissimo , sforzatissimo .
schubert's dynamics range from scream to whisper not loud to soft .
anarchy hardly seems your forte .
why not stick to clementi?
schubert was quite ugly .
did you know?
with your looks , nothing can ever hurt you .
why destroy what could bring us together?
mannerism is no ...
why can't i look at you?
because if i do , i won't resist the temptation to kiss you on the neck .
may i kiss you on the neck?
can i get you a glass of water?
thanks .
when can i see you?
let's call each other .
let's go away this weekend .
just you and l .
i can't , i'm going out with my mother .
cancel .
forget your mother .
think of us .
we must make up for lost time .
do you mean me?
i must make up for lost time?
darling !
stop always thinking of others , your mother , your scruples ...
you talk of anarchy but sacrifice love to be with mama .
let yourself go .
allow yourself feelings for once .
don't be such a leech .
you cough because you're uptight .
i have no feelings .
get that into your head .
if ever i do , they won't defeat my intelligence .
i love you .
don't be so cowardly .
is what you've written just as cowardly?
don't touch it !
not now .
i want you to read it alone .
now , get stuck in to schubert .
that's all you may do in this room .
piano .
con intimissimo sentimento .
erika !
are you mad?
what are you doing?
i followed you .
i said we'd speak on the phone .
you can't drive me crazy like that and then run off .
drive you crazy?
let's go somewhere where we can talk in private .
did you read the letter?
i don't want any letters .
i want us to talk !
i advise you to leave now .
never hound the woman you claim to love .
you should know that , even at your age .
if you value my affection , go .
i'll call you tomorrow to fix a date .
okay?
take your hat off .
what?
good evening .
i have matters to discuss with mr. klemmer .
what's that supposed to mean?
we won't bother you .
we'll talk in my room .
come on .
excuse me .
if you try to come in , you'll be sorry .
there's no food in .
i didn't expect visitors .
don't put yourself out , i've already eaten .
come here .
first , read the letter .
you've still got it?
yes .
so , read it now , please .
do you want to finish me off?
i said i don't want to read any letters .
i'm here , you're here .
we're made of flesh and blood .
don't be so scared .
i'm not .
i want all you want .
but read it first .
is that why we barricaded the door?
perhaps .
erika ...
please !
i don't know how much longer i want to play this game .
heavy .
sit down there , please .
on the contrary , if i beg , tighten my bonds , please .
adjust the belt by at least 2 or 3 holes .
the tighter the better .
then , gag me with some stockings i will have ready .
tuff them in so hard that i'm incapable ... of making any sound .
next , take off the blindfold , please , and sit down on my face and punch me in the stomach to force me to thrust my tongue in your behind .
is this supposed to be serious?
you're making fun of me , aren't you?
you want a slap?
for that is my dearest wish .
hands and feet tied behind my back and locked up next door to my mother but out of her reach behind my bedroom door , till the next morning .
don't worry about my mother , she's my problem .
take all the door keys with you from the apartment .
don't leave a single one here .
what will all this open up for me?
maybe you'd open your cultured mouth and comment on this shit .
no?
if you catch me disobeying any of your orders , hit me , please , even with the back of your hand on my face .
ask me why i don't cry out to mother or why i don't fight back .
above all , say things like that , so that i realise just how powerless i am .
what's going on in there?
open up !
move that chest .
don't you want to let her in?
do you want me to hit you in front of her?
calm down !
be quiet and watch the tv !
open up or you'll be sorry .
stop making a fuss !
incredible !
erika !
do you have no sense of decency?
invading people's homes like this .
the sheer nerve of it !
are you angry with me?
i hope you're not .
it's not very well written , i know .
i'm a pianist , not a poet .
after all , love is built on banal things .
think it over .
you have my phone number .
like i said , i want everything you want .
i have all we need .
but it can wait till tomorrow .
aren't you talking to me?
do i disgust you?
that's not necessary .
the urge to be beaten has been in me for years .
i waited for you , you know?
it's not a joke , all i wrote .
you know that .
from now on , you give the orders .
from now on , you choose what i am to wear .
what colour do you prefer?
you never said .
you're not talking to me?
you're angry?
say something then .
you're sick .
you need treatment .
if you want to hit me , hit me .
i don't want to soil my hands .
no one would touch your sort , even with gloves on .
i swear i loved you .
you don't even know what it is .
right now , you repulse me .
fuck it .
... came to north america with the spanish .
left to roam free , they became the famous mustang .
today's cowboys 'most loyal companion is the quarter horse .
very fast over short distances and with good stamina ...
you really are quite shameless .
what have you done with him?
is he still in your room?
it wouldn't surprise me .
nothing surprises me any more .
but you can do what you want .
at your age .
good lord .
all those sacrifices for this .
that's what you get in reward .
you carry on like that .
you can set up a bordello here .
who cares what the neighbours think !
as always , you do as you like !
i love you .
stop that !
have you gone insane?
what are you ...
stop it !
don't be so filthy , you're out of your mind !
shut up .
i love you .
i love you , too .
but stop this now .
you're mad !
you're mad .
you're completely mad .
go to sleep now .
you're going to need all your energy .
even if you're just standing in , you must be well prepared .
you never know who might be in the audience .
i saw the hairs on your sex .
walter !
can i have a word?
someone to see you .
is that your little sister?
don't run away , he's coming .
what do you want?
speak to you .
i'm listening .
not here , i can't .
over there .
how did you manage to find me?
just there .
go on in .
forgive me for the letter .
i'm an idiot .
i shouldn't have done that to you out of the blue .
like you said , we should have talked first .
forgive me .
what are you doing?
stop it .
get up now .
come on .
come on top of me .
you want me , don't you?
you're mad .
come on .
i love you .
i'll never write anything you don't want .
you tell me what you want , okay? come !
someone might come in .
you're being ridiculous .
get up .
hang on , let me do it .
let me do it , i said .
wait !
here .
i can't , not here .
stop it .
i can't .
it doesn't matter .
i can't do it here .
i know you want to protect us , but i don't care if people catch us .
i don't care .
i love you .
i love you , too .
come on .
you have to help me .
i don't believe it .
i'm sorry .
don't look .
don't look .
i must really disgust you .
no woman ever puked it back .
sorry .
i don't know what happened .
i'm clean .
i'm all clean .
like a baby .
inside as well as outside .
for you and thanks to you , darling .
do you like me calling you darling?
it's absolutely marvellous .
you must be patient .
i'll give you all the names , we'll play all the games you want .
you know you really stink?
sorry , you stink so much , no one will ever come close to you .
you'd better leave town until you don't stink so bad .
rinse your mouth more often , not just when my cock makes you puke .
who is it?
open up .
open up now !
what do you want?
i said , open the door !
quiet !
you'll wake the whole building .
i'm opening it .
don't do that again , okay?
what do you mean?
shut up , you sad cow !
just then ,
i was under your window and i was jerking off .
that's what you want , huh?
you want to ...
is that it?
you're a witch , a pervert !
you want to give everyone your illness , don't you?
not me !
i did apologise .
fuck your stupid apologies !
wasn't last night enough for you?
will you make this a habit?
screaming the house down .
go back to bed !
walter , please .
get out !
be off with you !
now !
not as you imagined?
we'll see about this .
the police will put a stop to this .
this is nothing to do with you .
forget your mother .
we have time .
we have all night .
let's pick up where we left off .
is this really what you had imagined?
no .
what then?
you'll be sorry .
just because we're women doesn't mean you'll get away with it .
let me go .
this is unbelievable !
at least this one has a key .
open up !
how about one for your daughter's room?
open up !
that's that dealt with .
as for my mother , pay no attention to her .
yes?
am i quoting you exactly?
open up !
you will see !
give me lots of slaps , darling .
hit me hard ...
no .
hit me around the face and hit me hard .
at your service , dear lady .
is that what you want?
stop , please .
what then?
not that .
stop , i beg you .
what are you doing?
shut it or i kill her !
murderer !
stop .
where's the water?
in the kitchen .
don't think you'll get me going ... by flashing your pathetic body .
you know ,
i do realise that all this isn't very nice of me .
but if you're honest , you'll admit you're partly responsible .
i mean , it's true ...
yes or no?
yes .
am i right?
yes , walter .
erika?
yes .
are you okay?
i'm okay
you can't get a guy going , then take refuge on the ice .
not my face !
not my hands !
murderer !
aren't you ashamed?
i'm begging you to stop .
don't touch my daughter .
leave my daughter alone .
i'm begging you .
why do you do that?
i calm down and you try to cross me .
be a little cooperative , fuck it .
i'd be happy to learn to play .
but not if we only ever play by your rules .
you can't delve around inside people , then reject them .
be nice to me , please .
you can't let me go just like that .
stop , please .
you have to give a bit .
you can't leave me all alone now .
love me , please .
are you trying to tell me i should go?
i'd appreciate it if you tell no one .
anyhow , it's for your own good .
you can't humiliate a man that way and ...
it's not possible .
will you be alright?
do you need anything?
okay?
you know , love isn't everything .
see you , then .
has he gone?
say something .
has he gone?
erika .
open the door .
what's wrong?
talk to me , for god's sake .
oh my god , child !
what a state you're in !
what did the bastard do to you?
hurry , we'll miss the tram .
i'm just having a glass of water .
don't be so nervous .
it's only to replace someone .
good evening professor !
i'm so looking forward to your schubert .
i think i should go and take my seat .
it begins in 8 minutes .
i'll come up with you .
good evening , i'm delighted to see you here .

she doesn't lack courage .
she insisted on coming tonight .
to hear you play .

my daughter , anna
