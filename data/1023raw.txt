willard !
where the hell is my blue hat?
i don't know , miss crock .

i'll help you find it .
i'm cold !
you taking a coffee break , lazybones?
all right , it's a good job .
i should have known it was you .
miss crock , you have such an appreciation of fine clothing ... ... l was thinking it was time you buy me a new uniform .
you lookjust fine to me , willard .
and you're dismissed .
but , it's disintegrating .
the buttons are barely hanging on .
willard , that is a terrific suit .
your father worked for me for 30 years .
wore that suit every day .
never complained !
yeah , and then he died .
and then , at the funeral , you made the undertaker give it back to you ... ... so you could stick me in it for another 15 years .
just what are you implying?
miss crock , it's christmas time .
i'm only asking for a new uniform .
only " a new uniform?
and pretty soon it'll be " only " a new broom , maybe .
and before you know it , i will be " only " bankrupt !
now , would you please get out of my sight ... ... before i kick you in the ass?
it's not my fault you have frost on your strawberries .
we have a contract .
well then , i'll see you in court .
excuse me , ma'am .
i've got the danish .
okay .
bring 'em in .
miss crock , i'd like you to meet ... ... gunn froling , erland vetterlund , per malmsjo and bertil guve .
the executive team from copenhagen snak food .
well , i'm just flattered that you're even considering my little factory .
lovely output .
that's terrific , gunn .
you are truly a great dane .
come , gentlemen , i'd like to show you the bun room .
i'm sure you'll love it .
it's just past jellies and creams .
what a bunch of bores !
i never know what those guys are saying .
never mind about that .
do you think we've got a deal?
does big boy have a weight problem?
soon you're going to be the richest , prettiest ... ... sexiest lady in the entire pastry industry .
i've told you , chip ... ... not in the office .
hey , guys .
nothing says christmas eve like some hot , spicy chicken wings .
all right !
lf they're so yummy , how come you only show up when it's free?
there he is .
about time !
can you believe it?
the old prune made me clean her chimney .
like she thinks santa's coming to pay her a visit .
now , look here .
be careful with this 'cause it's kind of strong .
willard , you need to make a new year's resolution .
quit working for the ball buster .
show her who's boss , man .
take a shit in her soup .
thanks .
that's real constructive .
you know how things are today .
a man has a job , he holds onto it .
ln your case , till he dies of old age .
yeah , like my old man .
you know what he said to me on his deathbed?
he said , " stick with miss crock .
you'll get ahead .
i don't know what he was talking about .
merry christmas , willard .
merry christmas , rusty .
good king wenceslas looked out
on the feast of stephen

oh , virginia , what a sweet gift !
i know how much you like money .
it's $50, 000 .
you can buy anything you want with it .
what are you standing around for , willard?
we don't want a mess now , do we , on christmas?
will that be all?
that will not be all .
merry christmas .
miss crock , i wasn't expecting this .
i thought of something that i knew you'd be thrilled to death with !
miss crock , god bless you .
open it !
you are a good woman .
what's this?
your favorite .
mincemeat pie .
where the hell is my suit?
goodness gracious !
sakes alive !
i thought you'd like it .
like it?
yes .
and i put a pair of cuff links in there as well .
you went all out , didn't you?
a pair of crackerjack cuff links and one shitty pie !
what are you doing?
i thought we were going to leroy's christmas kegger?
miss crock said i gotta spend a night in the box .
damn !
it's more like in filipino prison .
" get in that sweatbox !
leave me alone !
fine .
feliz navidad .
just in case you get hungry .
beat it .
this is my dinner .
you rat , i'll squash you .
come here .
i can't believe i've tolerated him for as long as i have .
he's just a user .
willard's exploited your generosity .
that's exactly right .
i mean his father , teddy , was a nice man .
but enough is enough .
really .
well , tomorrow , we'll ... ... fire him .
throw his stuff in the furnace .
santa claus must be stopped .
there will be no christmas this year .
you got that right .
you're not gonna believe this .
the old grinch is gonna fire me .
it's ridiculous .
why would someone fire their slave?
because she's mean .
she picked christmas day to do it .
damn !
you need revenge .
revenge !
we need revenge !
revenge !
we need revenge !
let's kidnap santa claus .
we'll break into his toy shop and seize him !
maybe those moon men are ...
... onto something .
you mean we should kidnap santa?
wait a minute .
why don't we just kidnap miss crock?
no , it's crazy .
no , that's brilliant !
we'll grab granny and hold her ass for ransom .
and if they don't pay , we start hacking off her fingers .
first her thumb , then her pointer ... ... then her little nasty finger .
what are you talking about?
we're not criminals .
you fry chicken , i drive a car .
when that money comes rolling in , i'll go crazy , man !
i'll laminate my menus .
shut up , okay?
we know nothing about kidnapping an old lady .
but what about her dog?
you mean biscuit?
no , muffin .
yeah , she loves him more than anything in the world .
i bet she'd pay plenty for that old bag of fleas .
yeah , i bet she'd pay $1 million .
remember , we have to be quiet inside the house .
miss crock is a light sleeper .
you ain't gotta worry about me .
this place is nice .
what the hell are you doing?
i'm checking for electric eyes .
there's no electric eyes .
how do you know?
they're invisible .
trust me .
i've lived here my entire life .
so , this is where the old bitch sleeps?
okay , give me the weenie .
okay , muffin .
i gotta special treat for you .
cripes !
what kind of aim was that?
muffin !
bite my weenie .
the hell with this .
plan b.
will you shut that dog up?
you bastard !
would you keep it down?
keep it down?
this thing is eating my hand !
jesus , this is a nightmare !
put him in the box !
who's smarter?
now who's smarter?
what should it say?
we've got him .
pay us $1 million , or he's a dead dog !
how does that sound?
fine .
let's get the hell out of here .
$1 million !
this is the happiest day of my life .
with that money , we can do anything .
i know what i'm gonna do .
i'm gonna buy me a four star chicken hole .
i'll get a better neighborhood and a listing in the zagat guide .
i'm going someplace warm where you don't need layered clothing .
start over .
i got some good years left in me .
i can better myself .
i'm gonna register at one of them four year universities .
my friend ... ... here's to second chances .
did you have a lovely sleep , muffin?
yes .
now , we'll have a lovely breakfast , you and ....
oh , my god !
look at me .
muffin !
look what they've done to your mother .
i don't know ....
we've got him .
pay us $1 million or he's a dead dog .
who's a dead dog?
willard?
man , we've got so many choices .
i'm just trying to get out of pittsburgh .
you said it .
check out this .
bora bora .
i was thinking more like caribbean myself .
whichever one has a school with a strong liberal arts program .
lord !
i'm dead !
we're going to jail .
what do you mean " we "?
that's my picture on the front page .
who would have thought kidnapping a dog would make the front page?
wait a minute .
they think it was me .
they think i was kidnapped .
they don't even mention muffin .
why would somebody kidnap you?
i don't know , but they think someone did .
there were signs of a scuffle , the chauffeur's blood was on a wall ...
... and a note demanded $1 million ...
... or he's a dead dog .
sweet jesus !
we kidnapped a turd .
according to sources , the missing chauffeur had been ... ... a loyal employee for over 15 years .
virginia crock , known for her mouthwatering treats ... ... awoke this morning to news that was not so sweet .
do you have any enemies?
not that i know of .
i'm just an elderly lady who makes pies .
well , does mr. fillmore have any enemies?
who?
that's willard's last name .
not that i know of .
did he have anybody that he used to bring around the house?
not that i know of .
does he have any living relatives?
not that i know of .
ma'am ... ... excuse me , but ... ... this man worked for you for over a decade ... ... and you don't know if he has any friends or any relatives?
detective , miss crock has told you everything she knows .
what do you mean?
she hasn't told me anything .
sir , if it makes you happy ... ... you go right ahead and find willard fillmore .
as for me ... ... it's time for my nap .
sources say that fillmore moved to pittsburgh at the age ofsix .
here's the thing .
i hardly knew willard .
police say ifyou have any information , call the piehunt hotline at 1 800
how did this get so big?
rusty , we gotta turn ourselves in .
how?
they think you're the victim .
shit !
you have to be really dumb to accidentally kidnap yourself .
wait a minute .
this is all gonna get pinned on me !
you gotta get un kidnapped !
you gotta escape !
the kidnappers go out to dinner , you chew through the ropes , you get away .
yeah , that's good .
that's good , but it should be real .
there was a struggle and i got all bruised and beat up !
this is an airtight alibi .
here .
let me help you .
good .
you like that , right?
yeah , wait a minute .
what?
i got an idea .
what are we worried about?
why don't i just stay kidnapped?
why?
it makes perfect sense .
lnstead of them paying $1 million for muffin , they pay it for me .
why would somebody pay $1 million for you?
'cause i'm a man .
muffin's a dog .
yeah , but he got a pedigree .
gimme a break , i'm better than he is !
come on !
i'm better than a dog !
i'm five times better .
" $5 million .
it's repugnant .
it's like a rising stock .
why did he jump from one to five?
all right , man .
let's see some real emotion here .
you're kidnapped .
let's see some tears .
i want to feel something real .
and action !
help !
save me !
miss crock , i'm begging you , please !
i got into msnbc .
how do you plug that camera in?
i think like this .
in a startling development in the pittsburgh kidnapping ... ... this shocking videotape was e mailed to msnbc .
help , miss crock , save me !
i'm begging you !
they got me wearing chains !
i'm living in a cage .
they're gonna kill me ifyou don'tpay .
open your wallet , you tight ass !
jesus , somebody has to do something !
dinnertime , dog .
they got me eating kibble .
i don't know how much longer i can last .
oh , god , chip ... ... he's wearing a collar .
collars don't hurt .
they're just trying to intimidate us .
whatis that?
is that urine?
itis !
itis !
it's human urine !
chip , we're late .
miss crock !
what's your reaction to the kibble video?
have you changed your mind about paying the ransom?
she'll not deal with criminals .
it's a police matter .
your chauffeur was chained like a dog .
where's your compassion?
i'll show you compassion .
get your asses off my property !
i'm afraid you didn't hear me .
i'm afraid you didn't hear me !
today , dessert baron virginia crock , reiterated she will notpay the ransom .
we went to the man in the street to find out what he thinks .
she's rich .
she can afford it .
if i worked for that ... chowder ... slut ... ... i'd tell her to ... get down , get busy on my ... man .
more concerned citizens have started a formal protest .
no more pies if willard dies !
ls that hillary?
she's looking good .
rich people are no good .
i'm never gonna eat herpie again .
this media blitz is killing us .
our sales have dropped 50 percent .
miss crock , go to hell !
miss crock
miss crock , many bad things are happened .
we thought we were buying your wholesome american image .
but it's terrible shock that you don't rescue your loyal houseman .
sweet old lady on pie box is now super villain .
i'm sorry , honey .
they're playing hardball .
lf you don't pay up , they're gonna walk .
fuck !
of course i'm gonna pay the ransom .
ijust didn't want to encourage those underworld criminals .
but now i want willard home again with me .
the old hag is coughing up !
thank you , miss crock .
and thank you , hillary , for kicking her ass !
i'm free !
we are millionaires !
anybody here?
hello?
what can i do for you?
are you rusty p. hayes?
yes , i am .
can i interest you in my shrimp boat special?
no .
i'm here investigating the kidnapping of willard fillmore .
who?
you must have read about him .
i don't read newspapers .
we thought you might know him .
we were going through mr. fillmore's belongings ... ... and we found this " chicken dinner special " punch card .
really?
yeah , this guy .
i was wondering what happened to him .
he was kidnapped .
when he came in here , did he ... ... ever do anything unusual that would draw attention to him?
one time i seen him eat 50 chicken gizzards all by himself .
look , if you come across anything that might help us ...
... give me a call .
sure .
i hate loose ends ... ... and i want this case to end .
i was so scared , i thought i was gonna pee in my pants .
he knows something .
he had a funny look on his face .
why'd you tell him so much?
i didn't tell him nothing .
i told him about the time you ate 50 chicken gizzards .
that wasn't me !
that was some chinese guy .
fong did do that , didn't he?
i'm telling you , we got problems .
that evil kojak hates loose ends .
and when they pay and i don't show up , that's a loose end .
he'll go nuts !
you'll be some place nice , like jamaica .
yeah , well , he'll track me there .
wait a minute .
what if we fooled them and made them think i was dead?
like maybe if we borrowed a corpse .
don't we know somebody who knows somebody ... ... who works at the morgue?
hillary used to live across the street ... ... from a dude who was in the army with this guy who worked at the morgue .
i forgot it was hillary .
yeah , you can't hit her up , man .
she just walked a picket line for you .
oh , my god !
i never thought i'd see you again , and here you are .
i brought you flowers .
oh , my god !
wow !
you're such a class act .
you get ransomed , then you buy me flowers .
well , i didn't get ransomed , per se .
did you escape?
no , i didn't escape literally .
shit .
where'd they go?
all right , how did you do it?
it was really no problem .
grover .
damn !
did all that in ten minutes .
spooky !
grover?
what are you doing?
get away from that .
i'm sorry .
it's just a rock .
it's not just a rock .
it's a pet rock .
a pet rock .
i haven't seen one of these in years .
yeah .
i just dug it out of his colon .
yeah , it's still warm .
i got a whole collection .
it's really amazing ... ... what you dig out of the inside of dead people when you cut them open .
people swallow everything .
here's some dice .
the guy must have been to vegas .
got all kinds of stuff here .
this beautiful harmonica .
don't put that in your mouth .
this is interesting here .
yes .
you gotta go in that way .
it couldn't have gone in this way .
he would have noticed .
a broom?
where'd it go?
oh , forget about it .
he's dead , and then you find it .
you know , it's all kinds of stuff like that .
this is good .
yeah .
it's a clicker .
hey , honey , where's the clicker?
i don't know .
lnside me .
here .
look at this .
a perfectly good comb .
grover , how would you like to make $100, 000?
well , that's a lot of cheese .
what i gotta do?
i want people to think that i'm dead .
dead?
yeah , you just take one of the dead bodies and dress it up like my man willard here .
and when they find it , they think it's him .
you think it's that easy?
i can just take up any old body ... ... and give it to you?
i got filing slips !
my bodies are catalogued !
this is a tight ship !
why don't you take some old bum that nobody would notice?
a " bum "?
come on ! lf you do it , there's $100, 000 for you .
will it show up on my w2?
no , tax free .
good .
because why should my money go to pave roads and build schools?
yeah , good point .
listen .
this is the plan .
dump the body tomorrow night .
and make sure you get someone that looks like me , okay?
no problem .
piece of cake .
here's some clothes of mine that you can put on him , all right?
and i got my driver's license .
you put that in his pocket .
yes .
and here's some jewelry .
jewelry?
those are nice .
wait a minute .
lsn't this suit kind of ratty?
ain't it gonna be degrading for a dead man to have to wear this trash?
just do it .
all right .
i'll do it .
miss crock , i just want to thank you for agreeing to pay the ransom .
'cause most folks ....
most folks just don't appreciate the work we cops do .
virginia .
what?
willard , bring in our guests some coffee here !
what's that?
i don't know .
the cover page is from pic 'n 'shop .
it's from the kidnappers .
miss crock , bring the cash to three rivers stadium at 10 : 00 pm .
no cops or the chauffeur dies .
no cops !
what if those bums run off with my money?
don't worry , ma'am .
that ballpark is so gigantic ... ... we're gonna be able to hide a million cops in there .
i thought these guys were smart , but they're in way over their heads .
you think the cops are gonna show up at the stadium?
you kidding me , man?
it's gonna be like rush hour at dunkin 'donuts .
yeah .
i'll be waiting for you in the runway lounge .
don't forget .
the flight's at midnight .
then , tomorrow ...
... we'll be lying on the beach .
sipping margaritas .
smoking a fatty .
this is the most distressful day of my life .
do we have to pay them all the money?
i mean , couldn't we , i don't know , sort of shortchange them a little?
virginia , bite the bullet .
i'm sure your taxman will figure a way to write it off .
that's a lot of green .
jesus christ , i don't know what the hell the wheel is doing on this side of the car .
god almighty , i don't know how poor willard ever put up with this shit .
hello?
this is the kidnapper .
how'd you get my number?
shut up !
there's been a change in plan .
don't go to no stadium .
i gotta go to the stadium .
you're not gonna do nothing until i tell you to , you smelly old bitch .
nowlisten ... ... you meet me at midtown park .
that place isn't safe after dark !
cork it !
i'll see you there in ten minutes .
quick , get me the police !
i'm still here !
try any more games like that , i'll put a bullet through willard's head .
gimme the money !
you're the kidnapper .
you no good hooligan !
you decimate my house .
you violate my public goodwill !
and why?
why me?
what did i ever do to you?
gimme the money !
you oughta be ashamed of yourself !
does your mother know the kind of work that you do?
don't you ever stop talking?
gimme the money !
now , i expect you to return willard in exactly the same condition he was in !
he was a strong worker !
and he had good teeth !
i got the money !
i got the money !
i gotta buy hillary a nice dinner .
i'm gonna buy my mom a new headstone .
one with her name on it and everything !
i got the money !
mister !
what's in the suitcase?
get away from me .
hey , mister , what's in the suitcase?
hand it over !
get away from me , you little shit !
what's in the suitcase?
show us some respect .
what's in the suitcase?
hand it over !
i don't like your attitude .
take a hike .
jesus christ !
harder !
zap him !
you can't let him down now .
you can't let him down .
yeah , let's see .
not bad .
don't pay any attention to me .
i'm just gonna take some work home .
i'm very conscientious .
oh , boy .
i'll go get it .
wake up !
where am l?
what is this?
what's going on here?
the police found you beat up in the park .
but , of course , those incompetents let the kidnappers get away , with my money .
so , i was in the park ... ... and they got away with the $5 million ....
you owe me .
and you're going to work off that ransom ... ... until the day jesus calls you home .
just a chunk light in spring water , not in olive oil , and a diet coke .
there you are , as i live and breathe .
pittsburgh's finest .
i'm truly sorry , ma'am .
but if it's any consolation , we had every inch of that stadium covered .
we had snipers .
who cares?
would you do me a favor?
find my cash .
i gotta get outta here .
mr. fillmore , i ....
could i have a few words with you?
sure , of course .
how can i help you?
i wonder , mr. fillmore ....
i wonder if you would ...
... give me a description of the kidnappers?
the kidnappers .
well , i never actually saw the kidnappers ... ... that well because i was kept blindfolded .
blindfolded?
but you were not blindfolded on the video .
no , i wasn't .
no , i wasn't blindfolded on the video .
but i didn't see the kidnappers then either , because ... ... they hired a tv crew to shoot the video .
yeah , we did it in a studio with a crew .
you got any nuprin?
no .
why?
what happened in there?
the bozo's covering for the kidnappers .
i really gotta get out of here .
stop !
where do you think you're going?
rusty !
hey , rust .
where you been?
the drop off did not go as planned .
i concur 'cause the plan never mentioned my best friend two timing me .
i didn't two time you !
come on , man !
i'll do the drop all by myself , that way rusty won't get in trouble .
where's the bag of money?
why aren't you at the airport?
what are you doing in a hospital?
a street gang took the money .
bullshit !
you're ripping me off !
no !
i swear to god .
it was these big muscle men in the park .
they beat me up and took the $5 million .
they had guns and tattoos ... ... and they had those two sticks on a chain that you swing and you hurt people with .
are you saying you were mugged?
mugged?
it was more like a rape .
well , not a real rape .
look , grand lnquisitor , if you had ripped me off ... ... would you barricade yourself in a hospital room with 20 cops outside?
you make an interesting point .
it's not imaginable that things could be more botched .
yeah?
what about grover?
oh , no !
that fruitcake's gonna be dumping my fake body .
hello , county morgue , rita speaking .
can i help you?
i'd like to speak to a grover cleaver .
i'm sorry .
mr. cleaver no longer works here .
bitch , what are you talking about?
mr. cleaver quit yesterday .
he said he was joining the superrich .
grover retired from the morgue .
too wealthy to hold a job .
man , we are no good at this .
we gotta stop this guy .
how?
we don't know where to find him .
call hillary .
she doesn't know him .
she knew his name from that fat dude who used to live across the street .
you're so defeatist !
fine .
i'll track him down myself .
lf you did it , you'd probably muck it up anyway .
the guy can't do anything right .
detective !
mr. hayes .
what are you doing here?
i'm visiting my aunt mabel .
she's real sick .
she got polio and emphysema ... ... all that shit together .
it's gonna kill her .
i swear .
she's staying in this room right here .
i'm gonna go say hi .
aunt mabel , come gimme some sugar , girl .
i told you don't listen to them doctors !
okay , you're convulsing .
you gotta relax .
all right , aunt mabel !
i'm gonna let you get some rest !
get some rest , aunt mabel !
all right , give uncle gordon my love !
that medicine got aunt mabel real irritable .
she's crazy .
she's normally a real sweetheart .
detective !
detective , you're not gonna believe what's happened .
we've just discovered a dead body .
shit .
they found the body !
they found the body !
oh , my lord .
that dumb ass grover .
he's the only one of us who follows directions .
we're going to jail .
we're going to jail .
we're gonna be somebody's bitch .
maybe if we confess , they'll go easy on us .
yeah , maybe we'll just get community service .
or maybe they'll take us to one of those country club prisons .
we'll talk stocks with bankers .
we could really make some connections .
you're insane .
we're gonna be somebody's bitch .
willard .
i have some shocking news .
they found your kidnapper .
are you sure it was the kidnapper?
of course i'm sure !
they found his dead body on the front steps of the quaker wax museum .
he was wearing all your clothes and those divine cuff links i gave you .
any idea why the kidnapper would be wearing your clothes?
no .
any idea why the kidnapper would be dead?
well , that kidnapping den was a real hothouse of emotion , you know .
anything could have happened .
well , let's just hope that body isn't so ripped up that you can't identify it .
that's the guy .
no question .
that's the kidnapper .
that's the guy?
that's the guy who beat you up and held you prisoner?
yeah , well , he was a lot more ferocious back when he was alive .
ferocious?
he's an old midget .
yeah , but he had a real low voice .
you know , very intimidating .
put your hands behind your head !
get in the corner .
that's him .
that's him !
i'd recognize that voice anywhere .
okay .
well , in some weird , screwy way that i will never understand ... ... that is the kidnapper .
i'm telling you , this whole thing stinks .
fillmore and hayes are connected .
yeah , that midget was no tough guy .
no shit , sherlock .

snowball .

open up !
have you heard the news?
yes , i know .
it's terrible .
what are we gonna do?
i don't know .
but this is not our fault .
you said it wouldn't hurt anyone !
you said if we switched the money nothing would happen .
the kidnappers would be stuck !
all i meant was that they couldn't complain to the police .
now we've pissed them off !
you deserve that money .
she's been a figurehead for years .
oh , stop it !
you're the only one holding that bakery together .
i had to .
she's out of her mind .

so , why don't we just let the kidnappers keep her?
get me out of here !
the pain !
i got a medical condition .
all right , fillmore .
time to talk .
my dick hurts !
i want the truth .
what's your connection to rusty p. hayes?
i've known rusty my whole life .
our mothers were in church choir together .
i don't even know this chauffeur guy , all right?
the first time i seen him was in my restaurant , two weeks ago .
last night , like every week , i called up rusty ... ... and told him to come and watch monday night football .
last night was thursday .
yeah .
i'm sorry .
it wasn't monday night football .
it was oprah .
last night , i get this call to make a delivery ... ... to this wilbur guy .
you mean , willard .
yeah , right .
willard .
so anyway , i drive up to this mansion in my chicken delivery truck .
you know your truck was impounded at the airport earlier that day?
it was?
yeah , right .
no , i was on foot .
so anyway , the doorbell rings , and it's the kidnappers !
so , they started chasing us .
and then miss crock , i remember she showed up .
she ran in , and she'd just been taking a bath , so she was nude .
of course , naturally , this upset everybody .
gunshots started going off , man .
the windows was exploding , i heard screaming .
so , i run to my truck as fast as i can .
i mean , i run away because i was scared .
chip oswald says you hit him over the head with a desk lamp .
no , he's mistaken .
he's mistaken .
that was not me .
so , rusty's got this desk lamp and he's beating the hell out of chip .
and , he's pounding him and pounding him .
rusty , that's not the kidnappers .
that's chip !
that's when the cops showed up and they distracted everybody ... ... and the kidnappers got away .
one final question .
let's forget all this other crap .
where is miss crock?
i don't know .

miss crock , we're here to rescue you .
how dare you kidnap yourself !
you tried to swindle me?
i am going to have your ass !
miss crock , i'm sorry .
what nerve !
after all i've done for you .
i was under a lot of pressure , and i ....
after all you've done for me?
willard fillmore , the building is surrounded !
what exactly , miss crock , did you ever do for me?
i've been your slave for 15 years !
i worked my butt off !
and then , when i got kidnapped , you wouldn't even pay the ransom money !
well , after all , you ...
... were just a hired servant .
hired ....
well , does a hired servant watch tv with you when you're lonely?
does a hired servant read to you that time you broke your glasses?
does a hired servant visit you in the hospital when nobody else does?
i did everything my father would've .
not everything .
your father was , a very special man .
he provided extra services .
oh , my god .
your dad didn't say , " stick with miss crock .
you'll get ahead .
he said , " stick with miss crock and you'll get head .
would you butt out?
we're talking here !
yuck !
let's move !
can you see them?
they're on the third floor .
oh , man !
that's why i couldn't compare to my dad?
now , don't be silly .
it's just that ... ... your father was very gifted .
that's some big shoes to fill .
i don't wanna hear this !
man , you must've been a total let down .
no wonder she ransomed you with an empty suitcase .
that suitcase wasn't empty .
i paid every cent .
then why do roger and chip have the money?
roger and chip?
stop !
don't shoot !
they're stupid and confused !
position !
move out !
i'm going in .
come on !
i can't believe it .
i can't believe chip shafted me .
i can't believe you came through .
beaver team , move in !
go !
it's like an army out there .
i'm on parole for mail fraud .
i gotta hide .
how'd you get in there , man?
i mean ...
come on , grover ! ... l ... ... took care of all of chip's gambling debts .
i paid for all his methadone treatments .
i guess we both got the big screw .
come on , grover !
don't move !
hayes and fillmore ... ... you're under arrest , again , for the abduction of virginia crock .
and this time , it's gonna stick !
you clod .
they didn't kidnap me .
they rescued me .
lf willard hadn't shown up , i'd be dead and buried in this hellhole !
i don't understand .
then who's the kidnapper?
first , i wanna upgrade the assembly line .
toss out minced meat .
bring in vanilla custard .
then , i'm gonna mix strawberry into the rhubarb .
freeze !
you're under arrest .
chip oswald ... ... you are under arrest for the kidnappings of willard fillmore and virginia crock .
that is ridiculous !
how dare you !
i demand you leave my house !
put on your pants .
you're going to jail .
all right , let's get them hands behind your back .
oh , my god !
it's the new village people .
you're all crazy !
put down that gun !
i'm not going back to prison !
what do you mean ...
... " back "?
up yours !
i've got nothing from all of those years of suffering , working for you !
nobody does .
stay out of this !
i'll see you all in hell !
i'll slice you and i'll dice you ... ... and i'll bake you all into meat pies !
well , it's an ugly ending , but the case is solved .
i knew he was the kidnapper the whole time .
never trust a black man named chip .
this is so beautiful .
i could spend the rest of my life here .
yeah .
and we found a place where almost everyone speaks english .
there's my juicy , succulent chicken .
come here .
how's business , baby?
great , rusty .
you guys got a package .
look .
it's from miss crock .
what did she send?
check it out .
it's an armani suit .
and there's a letter .
dear willard , i hope you're enjoying your retirement money .
here's a suityou can wear when you graduate from u. s. c.
back in pittsburgh , i decided not to sell the company .
and i have a new man in my life .
grover's quite special .
he's a little slow , but he does what he's told .
so , thanks again forintroducing us .
your everlasting friend , virginia .
