love me if you dare
i like this game very much .
housing game , when the the banker lost .
i like bead game , i win ; jumping game is for fools .
unless girls .
i don't play guessing game ; the house jumping is quite good for two persons .
hide and seek is quite good too .
but you can't play one game .
i say , never .
even your best friend suggests .
it's a game that bury yourself into a heap of concrete .
this game started with a beautiful house .
a bus without driver .
a beautiful box .
a beautiful friend .
in fact , i made a mistake .
this game started long long ago .
it started with a sick word .
transfer .
why not mammouth?
this made mother crys .
in all , doctor , thay don't like anything .
your situation is very urgent ... they all talk nonsense .
their trousers are too bad .
look !
imagine that what they know about mothers .
also some unlovely word , like kowalsky .
don't search anymore .
i don't want to refer it .
kowalsky .
polish !
and .
don't forget the disgusting faces .
all this is the same thing .
that is " i don't feel well " .
no one feels so bad like me on the earth and mars .
you love her .
wei?
me too .
i think she is very pretty .
give it to me .
this is really cowry , right?
oh !
i have never seen a beautiful rounded playground like this .
never , never .
no .
i have seen it , but not on earth .
me too .
where?
is it real?
does it really exit?
yes .
my angel , here .
and here .
and here .
julien , you go by bus tomorrow morning .

he will not .
he dare not ..
don't beat him .
you don't have the right to beat him .
shut up !
think twice .
father doesn't like sophie .
he doesn't like her from the beginning .
the game started successfully .
if the box is in her hand , she asks me to prove it .
i do it to win the box back .
so i give sophie a guaranty .
it is absurd , isn't it?
foolish game?
perhaps .

the dance of marylin, and schtroumpfette
better than lara croft
better than jimmy hendrix, than armstrong .
better than the walk around by santa claus
better than bill gates, then the trances of dalai lama .
better than the collagen on the lips of pamela anderson
better than the drugs of rimbaud , morrison .
better than freedom
better than life
