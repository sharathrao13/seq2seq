the essence of life isn't comic .
it's tragic .
there's nothing intrinsically funny about the terrible facts of human existence .
i disagree .
philosophers call it absurd because , in the end , all you can do is laugh .
human aspirations are so ludicrous and irrational .
i mean , if the underlying reality of our being was tragic , my plays would make more than yours , because my stories would resonate more profoundly with the human soul .
i mean , it's exactly because tragedy hits on the truly painful essence of life that people run to my comedies for escape .
no , no .
tragedy confronts .
comedy escapes .
look , you guys , what are we discussing here?
is there a deeper reality in comedy or tragedy?
who can make such ajudgment?
look , let me tell you a story and you tell me , is it material for a comedy or a tragedy?
this happened to some people i know .
it's a small dinner party .
the hosts are trying to impress one of their guests .
suddenly the doorbell rings and out of nowhere an unexpected person shows up .
a man or a woman?
a woman .
i'll give you the details and you tell me comedy or tragedy .
so , the guest enters and everyone is surprised , especially the host .
turns out she's got a particular problem ...
my god , that's quite amusing .
i mean , she barges in unannounced while they're eating .
what you told us would make a very good romantic comedy .
because you see the world comically .
you're missing the tragic implications .
the entanglement it suggests .
no , i see the whole thing quite differently .
i see this lone figure a woman who's maybe just come off a bus .
she's toting a suitcase .
maybe she's searching nervously for an address .
hello?
who is it?
hello?
hello?
can i help you , miss?
the springers .
top floor .
it's really good .
these speakers are wonderful .
you do pick up every little nuance of the orchestra .
tell me again why i can't have a glass of wine?
every pregnancy , she asks the same question .
this is the " concerto in d " .
yes .
my god , you really know your stravinsky .
this would be good theme music for the play .
lee?
that's a brilliant idea .
i need a little help with the final touches .
can you get the two big serving dishes?
i'm running out of obsequious banter .
how's it going?
he thinks i'm perfect for the part .
the goddamn producer wants more of a name .
i don't understand why they make such a big deal .
it's not like it's the lead .
my first audition went better .
i don't know what happened .
and i know it's not the lead , laurel .
doesn't he have any clout?
they want a name .
i'm not a name .
you didn't marry a name .
sally said how much she loves your place .
how long are you here?
six months , and we're still not finished .
we have to furnish slowly cos we used up all our money .
we could not go on in that one bedroom .
the piano ate up the living room .
we're living beyond our means .
i get nervous .
laurel is certain god will provide .
they're poor , but happy .
definitely poor .
what do you do , peter?
i'm a lawyer .
no jokes , please .
think the music's a little too loud?
i saw you listening to the mahler and crying .
you should have seen her .
she was listening to mahler with tears streaming down her face .
she looked so beautiful .
i wanted to hug her .
yeah .
but i had to get up early and film a deodorant commercial .
that's work at least , right?
i think someone rang before .
did you hear?
so , how do you all know each other?
we grew up together , cassie and i.
we were those little girls at school with the plaid skirts .
and lee and i met at northwestern .
he was the star actor , the handsome athlete .
everybody wanted him .
but laurel got him .
melinda?
hi .
melinda?
hi , melinda , hi .
my goodness .
god .
cassie .
i'm stunned .
here , let me take these .
god , look at you .
you look so ...
no , don't .
don't say what you're thinking of .
i've been on a bus .
i've been on a greyhound bus since tuesday , so i'm sure i look like the wreck of the hesperus .
a bus from where?
i mean , what are you doing here?
i've moved around .
i had to keep moving .
events unfolded in such a way that ...
is it all right if i smoke?
i just feel a little nervous barging in on you like this .
why don't you sit down and eat with us?
this is jack and sally oliver .
hi .
hi .
i'm melinda robicheaux .
i've gone back to my mother's name .
it's french .
she was parisienne .
you must have dropped off the goddamn moon .
shall i get a chair?
i could use a drink .
champagne or white wine .
the truth is , i've gotten very used to single malt scotch .
an acquaintance of mine introduced me to it , so ...
i really should freshen up , though .
if i could just get a single malt scotch , and ...
look at me .
jesus .
i need a hot shower .
yeah .
ok , please ...
excuse us .
please start .
this is so unexpected .
i'll say .
you had no hint she was coming?
she was nuts then , and she's nuts now .
did you see the look in her eyes?
she's been on a bus .
you were asking how we know each other .
melinda is the third musketeer .
we went to school together .
we haven't heard from her in ages .
yeah .
she's had personal difficulties .
she said she'd be coming to new york from ...
i can't remember , chicago or indiana , and could we put her up?
laurel said , " sure . " i myself ...
this is not the time to discuss this .
let's just eat and change the subject .
well , what can you do?
we've all had friends drop in unannounced .
remember your aunt?
i put up an extra bed .
i fix up the room for her .
she doesn't show when she says she will .
so we try to contact her and there's no trace of her .
two months later , she calls up unannounced in the middle of a frigging dinner party .
am i unreasonable?
no , no !
you're missing the whole point .
you have the makings of a delightful human comedy here .
you missed the humour in everything .
i see a sweet , tree lined block on the upper east side .
it's a dinner party .
the husband is fawning over his guest .
he's a moviemaker .
no , wait .
here's the idea .
make the film director the wife .
he's just her out of work actor husband .
she's trying to impress the guest and raise the money for an independent film .
i just told jennifer that steve is interested in investing in susan's next movie .
yeah .
i have most of the money .
i've just been trying to get it going now for two years .
i liked your first picture .
would you do this one on video too?
no .
that was just because we only had $300, 000 .
this one will be on 35mm for sure .
well , how much do you need?
i've raised about four million and we need another two million .
the problem is the theme is controversial .
what's the theme?
well , let's put it this way .
it's a mostly all female cast and it's called the castration sonata .
do you happen to have single malt scotch?
you know , let me check .
hurry .
i'm running out of obsequious banter .
don't throw me .
everything's timed .
chilean sea bass and caramelised filo is not like scrambled eggs .
well , he happens to love it .
does he love it $2 million worth?
god , i hope so .
i told you we should keep single malt scotch .
who drinks it?
he does .
god , you're definitely going all out .
you're dressed very sexy .
hobie , keep your eyes on the sea bass !
ok , ok , ok .
she goes down to buy a bottle of single malt scotch .
are you ok?
yeah , i'm fine .
are you sure?
yeah .
here we go .
these are coquilles st jacques with cinnamon .
and we're having sea bass in a caramelised filo pastry , lightly dusted with lime powder .
did someone send you a yuppie cookbook?
susan says you're a wonderful chef .
i'm an out of work actor .
who's that?
hi .
hi .
i'm sorry .
i hope i'm not intruding .
no , it's ok .
i've been having a kind of bad time and i just took some sleeping pills .
sleeping pills?
how many?
28 .
whoa !
call 911 .
stay and just eat .
it's gonna get cold .
sit .
just stay and eat .
it's ok .
it's ok .
hobie , make some black coffee .
ok , ok .
i'm allergic to coffee , but do you have any vodka?
vodka?
maybe we should call a doctor .
it's ok .
i just need something to calm my nerves .
do you live in this building?
i've been subletting for a month .
somebody call a doctor .
careful .
i'm gonna be sick .
that's the best thing .
no , no , not on the carpet .
that's a new carpet .
go to the bathroom .
i smell smoke .
can you smell smoke?
god !
the chilean sea bass lightly dusted with lime !
should you be taking those pills?
you didn't have any dinner .
if i don't , i can't sleep .
well , cassie's put on weight , not that i'd ever say anything to her .
cassie's pregnant .
again?
they swear they're stopping at three children .
for me , two was just the right number .
is there any word?
no , there's none .
there's nothing .
now , i don't want you to get panicky , but i am planning on staying .
just for a while .
i just need to find a place and settle in and rebuild my career .
and you did say that you had enough room to put me up .
we were surprised you never showed up .
we had everything ready .
lee had gotten your room in order .
i apologise for that .
i was going through a kind of confused down period .
i was worried .
lee couldn't figure out how to get in contact with you .
i'd no idea you were using different names .
what happened?
i thought the worst was over .
can i speak openly?
of course .
i tried to commit suicide .
you didn't .
i did , and it wasn't a half hearted attempt .
it wasn't a cry for help .
why?
i thought everything that happened was past .
i thought you'd pulled yourself together .
because that's what i wrote you , and some days i honestly thought it .
but in the end , i just couldn't take it any more .
melinda .
you didn't find me because i was indisposed .
if you've never been in a state mental hospital in a straitjacket , i wouldn't recommend one , especially not the one i was in , in the midwest .
i'm overwhelmed .
are you ok?
i mean ...
i'm all right .
i'm on the road back .
i'm still a little fragile when everything closes in , but i get stronger every day .
you know you're welcome to stay here as long as you like .
there .
how long is she gonna stay?
why?
we promised my sister could stay for thanksgiving .
well , thanksgiving's not for a while .
well , i'm just saying .
she's trying to pull her life back together .
she's her own worst enemy .
you don't know the details .
details?
what details?
she was married to some doctor .
she had two kids .
what was she doing playing around with ...
what was he?
he was a photographer .
melinda .
lee's right .
whatever i went through , i'm responsible for .
look , we've all been drinking and we're really tired .
it's ...
no , he's right .
i was married to a man who loved me and gave me the two most beautiful children .
that i'm not allowed to set eyes on them is just proof of my weakness and my husband's strength .
no .
it's disgusting how much influence he had on the judge .
it's who you know .
life is all networking .
i brought it on myself because i was bored .
i mean , not bored with my children .
god , they were the light of my life .
but i was bored being a doctor's wife , just as my mother was bored being a doctor's wife .
like madame bovary .
it's not that st louis isn't very beautiful .
it's just that everything that had seemed so magical when i married josh somehow just melted away .
it was ok , you know?
and no matter what i did , i couldn't make it any better .
and then this man with a romantic name
john san giuliano took my photograph .
and i fell in love with him , and we began having this love affair .
and he wanted to know if i could see myself living in italy , and i said , " well , look , mr san giuliano , i'm married to a surgeon with two children .
my life is fixed , so don't ask me to tax my imagination .
let's just confine our passion to local motels and forget capistrano .
and then reality set in in the person of a private detective with the unlikely name of woodkrutch , and my children were handed over to my humiliated husband forever .
mr san giuliano took me on a safari to help me forget things .
but i can't forget , no matter how hard i try .
then he met someone else .
stop , melinda .
why?
it only gets worse .
so that's pretty much how i got here .
my god , that's a sad story .
guy leads her on , causes her to break up her marriage , then dumps her .
i caught him in bed with one of his models .
i mean , who can blame him?
she was a 6ft swede who was a miss world runner up .
her legs started at her chin .
see , that's why my film , the castration sonata , puts male sexuality in perspective .
it's lucky you didn't have children .
he could have made custody trouble .
i always wanted to have children , but my husband wouldn't hear of it .
he couldn't bear having sex with a pregnant woman for nine months , especially the fat months .
so , what are you gonna do now?
i'm an art historian .
at least , that's what i majored in at brandeis .
and i may be getting offered ajob in an art gallery .
it's only cataloguing , but i'm in no position to turn it down .
anyone for more ants climb a tree before i throw it out?
i can't eat another bite .
dinner was delicious .
sorry about burning the sea bass and the kitchen curtains .
i'm sorry about busting in on you .
no , no .
we love it when unexpected women barge in and throw up .
i'm kidding .
i hope tonight didn't kill my chances of getting my movie made .
no , no .
i think steve walsh was ok .
i told him i was gonna play a male character in the movie .
what did he say?
we discussed acting .
i told him about my award winning pygmalion .
hobie , that was in college .
it was brilliant to play henry with a limp .
god , i hate being an assistant director .
after you've made your own film?
sad thing is , he could have my movie happen like that .
what's $2 million to a real estate billionaire?
the upkeep of his private jet is worth more than that .
he was very impressed with you , and you looked very sexy .
really?
you thought i looked sexy?
you are sexy .
really , you're very sexy .
hobie , it's 2am .
what's going on?
we used to make love all the time , and now there's always an excuse .
i'm going through an emotionally difficult time creatively .
you feel we don't communicate?
of course we do .
can we not talk about it?
hi .
sorry i'm late .
i saw these the other day .
i think they would look very beautiful on you .
beautiful , but you know lee .
he gets crazy about my spending .
how's he doing?
you're not hurting for cash?
he's on tenterhooks about the play , but we're fine .
he's got a number of irons on the fire , some promising possibilities .
i have a very good prospect for melinda .
ajob prospect?
a guy .
remember bud silverglide?
no .
have i met him?
remember we had thanksgiving at my house and he brought his little girl emily?
emily ...
emily?
his wife had died the year before .
yes .
i sat next to him .
he's average looking .
he's fine .
he'd be perfect .
he's a very lovely guy .
he's smart .
he's been through his share of suffering .
melinda would have a ready made family .
you think he's right for her?
i remember him as pleasant , but ...
she should be so lucky .
he's got a very successful dental practice in manhattan .
he plays bridge .
he likes to hike .
think he'd be interested in melinda , especially when her past unfolds?
i know .
she's in no bargaining position when all the facts come out .
look , i can only bring them together .
he's not the kind of guy who'd ever wind up hurting her .
that means a lot .
left to her own devices , melinda can be self destructive .
bud is sweet , and i know he's lonely because he's taken ads in the personal columns .
don't tell melinda that .
peter's checking into her custody case to see if it's a lost cause .
i told her to meet us here for lunch after herjob interview .
should we sit?
i don't know .
can we take this table?
thanks .
i know it's here somewhere .
we got this house guest living here .
everything's messed up .
i wish she would check before she moves my possessions .
i love your loft .
it's really amazing .
here we are .
an essay on desdemona's role in othello .
the scene you should do in our next class is the one we talked about yesterday .
you really think i'm ready for it?
i do .
you're among the two or three most talented students in my class , and the sooner you challenge yourself , the better .
you're the only one who makes me feel confident enough to take chances .
aren't you nervous bringing me back here?
it's ok .
my wife's shopping , then going to lunch .
she's always shopping and lunching .
she grew up shopping and lunching .
her mother did , and her grandmother .
you shouldn't really drink so early in the day .
shopping and lunching's what you get when you marry a park avenue princess .
what does your wife do?
besides shopping?
she teaches tin eared teenagers at a music school a few days a week .
it's funny , but life has a malicious way of dealing with great potential .
my god .
get ...
hi .
i just got back from my job interview .
i don't think it went too well , so just stopped off for a little pick me up .
you ok?
yeah .
yeah .
well , i'm gonna go and meet laurel and cassie for lunch in our old neighbourhood .
i'm just gonna go freshen up .
the park hasn't changed a bit .
not at all .
it brings back so many memories .
those days are gone when the three of us thought we could call the shots .
what i wouldn't give to wake up and find my life has been a bad dream and we're all still 17 .
tell me about it .
you wouldn't change anything .
i mean , your life is pretty much on track , right?
well , the question's not fair .
i mean , who wouldn't profit from a second go around?
so , what about bud silverglide?
the dentist with the charming little daughter?
he's a wonderful guy .
if anything ever did happen and you hit it off , you could establish something solid .
not more unrealistic pipe dreams that can't help but wind up badly .
i'm sorry .
did that come out harsh?
the truth is , i'm nervous .
i wanna meet someone so desperately , but when the chance comes along , i just panic .
it won't be a date .
i'll make a dinner party and we'll all be there to support you .
i'll invite a number of nice guests and he'll be one of them , and if you meet and hit if off , then great , and if not , then no obligation .
yeah .
when he hears my story ...
my god .
i come with such baggage .
well , don't go in with a defeatist attitude .
yeah .
first see if you even like him .
if he's as nice as cassie's painting him ...
he's a good catch , if i can speak pragmatically , especially for you , cos he's got his feet on the ground .
if i find him at all attractive , i think i should just tell him my whole story right off .
or do you think it's better to wait?
let him take the hook first , and then run with it?
god .
i can't believe i'm even asking this .
i'm already strategising .
i haven't met this guy yet .
if we're gonna do this , it has to be completely informal , cos i can't handle it any other way .
i don't have any dressy clothes anyhow .
funny part of that is , as elegant as i can look and you know , i can look pretty stylish men find women sexier in casual attire .
it's true .
i could wear my hair down and loose .
that's enticing already .
at least it's not intimidating .
you haven't told him anything about me?
i can if you like .
no .
no .
my sad tale should come from my lips , if and when i choose to reveal it .
cut .
ok , great .
that was great .
it was great .
you took the note great .
print one and six .
you got it?
ok , hey , everybody , that's lunch .
one hour .
thank you .
hey , are you gonnajoin us?
no .
i'm meeting a friend .
tell the actors we're gonna do scene ten instead of 26 .
ok .
we're doing scene ten instead of 26 .
hey .
hey .
should we just sit here?
yeah .
so , what did he say?
that steve is inclined to put up the money .
he likes your script and wants to have lunch with you .
fantastic !
yeah , it looks really good .
he was concerned that you intended for hobie to play the psychiatrist .
you know , he wants a name .
i understand .
it's gonna be kind of a touchy subject at home because , i mean , the truth is he'd make the perfect shrink , and he knows it .
but , let's face it , he's not a name , and i want people to see my movie too , so ...
well , i'm sure that you guys will figure it out , and i think it's very exciting .
doug and i know somebody perfect for melinda , your downstairs neighbour who crashed dinner .
remember greg earlinger?
no .
doug's dentist .
you met him with us once .
yes .
he has a great sports car .
the bentley .
he's single and available .
she would find him fascinating .
he's smart , sensitive ...
why would he be interested in her?
she seemed quite pretty , she's offbeat and greg always likes complicated women .
doug has already hyped him on her .
ask her if we can give him her number , ok?
hey .
melinda .
hey .
hi .
hi .
my friend walt .
this is melinda .
she just moved in .
how are you?
nice to meet you .
how's it going?
all right .
i just interviewed for ajob at an art gallery and i don't think it went too well .
you never know .
i had a voice over audition today .
thought i'd never get it .
bang , i was chosen .
it's the voice of a toothpaste .
that's good .
i'm trying to decide whether to stay and wait for the phone call or whether i should go out and treat myself to a movie .
why don't you come with us?
where?
going to the track .
to the track?
yeah .
horse races .
belmont .
what , you play the horses?
never .
well , i go every ten years .
walt's always going .
he's a gambling degenerate .
yes .
can't you tell i'm a degenerate?
i'm a complete novice , like you .
come on .
it's a beautiful day .
we'll have some laughs .
sure .
i don't have any money .
i've got plenty of money .
for both of us .
we'll pool our resources .
if you want .
ok .
all right .
yeah .
nice to meet you .
nice to meet you again .
come on !
come on , bedazzled !
let's go , bedazzled .
no , no .
you did not bet on bedazzled .
it's a 90 1 horse !
if it wins , we're rich .
he's right , hobie .
he's dropping back .
no , no , no , no , no .
he's second .
he's second ... second from last .
so , i have to ask you , how'd you go from living on the upper east side to st louis?
i moved there for him .
he was gorgeous .
he was talented , he was sexy , he was a doctor , he was charming ...
yes , but where's the attraction?
he just knew how to touch me .
you mean emotionally?
no , with his hands .
i'm a very passionate person , so sex is very important to me .
you know , i need a lot of physical intimacy very often and creatively .
right .
right , right , right , right .
that's ... that's ...
yeah .
am i being too frank?
no , no , no .
no , i just ...
i'll be ok .
i get hot flashes .
your wife is passionate .
i can tell by looking .
right , right .
a lot of people have noticed .
why did your marriage fail again?
he was cheating with his secretary .
i felt neglected , so i started seeing someone else .
i just wanna find someone , fall in love and have a life .
hello .
hey .
guess what?
what?
steve is putting up the money for my film .
that's great .
congratulations .
so if i'm suddenly very busy and distracted , don't take it personally .
and we have to talk about casting .
yes .
what did you do today?
i told you .
i went out to the track .
yeah .
with who again?
with who?
with me , with me .
with me ... me and walt .
walt wagner .
well , i hope you didn't lose a lot .
no .
we don't have a lot , so i couldn't .
in fact , if i had more money , we could've lost more .
it's a system i developed .
why didn't you just tell her melinda came along?
what did you just say about melinda?
what?
no .
i didn't say anything about melinda .
you just muttered her name .
i was wondering how the poor thing's doing .
you know , plain looking girl , all alone ...
i'd hardly call her plain looking .
well ...
jennifer wants to set her up with someone .
remember greg earlinger , doug's dentist?
we met him once .
he's a tall , sexy , handsome looking guy .
the bentley .
very well off .
charming , bright .
you commented on how impressive he was .
vaguely .
anyway , doug's hyped him on melinda .
yeah , i think ...
why , i do recall him .
wasn't he full of himself , though?
kind of an unjustified self confidence?
as i recall , it was justified .
someone who has an answer for everything .
i'm gonna ask melinda if it's ok if we give him her number .
no .
no , don't be silly .
what does she wanna do with a dentist?
she was already married to a doctor .
she found that dull .
a dentist is the same thing , but oral .
greg's not dull .
he hikes .
he's a great bridge player .
tennis .
he goes on safaris .
well , it ...
i mean , who goes on safaris?
you need shots to do that .
melinda , hey , it's susan .
how are you?
good .
i was wondering if it was ok with you if we give your number to this wonderful guy .
i'm not giving the number out .
don't say that i am ...
he's a very rich dentist .
he's cultivated and athletic .
he's gorgeous looking .
gorgeous dentist " is an oxymoron .
and ...
there's nothing to be nervous about .
look , we'll all go out , the four of us .
we'll go to dinner or we'll go to a show or something .
i don't think you'll be sorry .
i think she's never , ever gonna go for it .
ok , great .
not in a million years .
fantastic .
ok , bye .
she loves the idea .
i told you .
hi .
what are you doing down here?
i got the part !
the director kept insisting and the producers finally gave in .
that's great , lee .
finally , a role i can make sing .
you're certainly a natural for the character .
why would you say that?
you've said it a hundred times .
i said i could act the hell out of it .
he's a loser .
let's not fight .
i meant nobody can play the part like you can .
you see me like that , don't you?
i'm asking .
is that how you see me?
i'm really happy for you .
i know how much you wanted this .
can't we leave it at that?
i'm wired .
i didn't mean to seem snappish .
shall we go out to dinner and celebrate?
tonight's cassie's party .
yeah , right .
ok .
jesus .
it's time melinda met someone , moved on .
i'd like a little privacy in the apartment .
ok .
i've got a couple of options .
i could wear ...
i can wear this skirt with this shirt , like this .
this goes around the other way , like this , and i could wear it with this shirt here .
what do you think?
the silk one is sexier , but this one's elegant .
you think the silk one's sexier?
so maybe i should wear this .
sex works best in the end .
men like to feel there's some hot payoff waiting for 'em somewhere down the track .
god , look at me .
i'm so fat .
fat?
melinda , everyone should be so fat .
i didn't eat anything since friday .
i wanted to lose six pounds .
it's not healthy .
i mean , an empty stomach and all those pills , and ...
i don't know .
maybe this is better .
maybe sex is too predatory a message to send , and elegance is a wiser opening gambit .
i don't think it matters much .
you look great .
doesn't she?
yeah .
very stylish .
look at me .
i'm fat .
i can't lose any weight .
i think i need another drink .
alcohol's fattening .
can you make it a vodka?
plus an empty stomach with pills?
vodka's not fattening .
i need something to calm me down , just to make me a little more confident .
i've got goddamn circles under my eyes .
you look fine .
that's easy for you to say because you're still beautiful .
i feel like i'm running on empty .
i don't wanna go .
honestly , i don't wanna go to this thing .
come on .
it's just a little party with friends .
how did i wind up desperate?
because that's what i am , laurel .
there's no other word .
you're a catch for the right man .
you really are .
falling in love is gonna work wonders for you .
congratulations .
i hear lee got that part .
we're very excited .
no one at school played the classics like lee .
they still talk about the strindberg series .
yes .
he's held himself back from commercial work because he's got such high standards .
he won't do anything just for the money .
yeah .
i knew that director would have his way , and he wanted you .
my agent'll bring film people to the opening cos there's talk of a project in california .
i'd drink to your good fortune , but vodka's not good for samantha .
it's gonna be a girl .
cassie , i never slept with a pregnant woman before .
no?
no .
it always struck me as so erotic doing it with your big belly .
peter says it's just like screwing any fat person .
i don't suppose he'd lend you out to me so i could satisfy a lifelong lustful curiosity?
why don't you get laurel pregnant?
then you wouldn't need to make arrangements .
maybe if things work out now , we can start to think about it .
i always wanted to have kids .
knock her up , then you can make love to her in all the trimesters .
if you knew how much i wanted to do it with you , you'd do itjust out of human kindness .
too late .
ball was in your court years ago .
you ran in another direction .
how's our matchmaking going?
they seem to be hitting it off well .
peter , what's it like to sleep with a pregnant woman?
have you ever made love with a loser at weight watchers?
didn't i tell you?
the great thing about hiking is you're free .
you feel free .
you're up there in the mountains or in the woods , and it's beautiful .
almost religious .
and i am not religious .
certainly not after dorothy passed away .
that must have been really tough on your daughter .
i've tried to explain it all to emily , including the whole religious aspect , but what the hell?
she's four .
i just don't want her to be angry at god or against religion .
i want her to be happy and educate herself and make her own decisions about the big questions .
look , melinda ,
i'd love to call you .
maybe we could spend some time getting to know one another .
i know you just returned to new york , but it's really changed .
i'd be glad to show you around .
to tell you the truth , bud , i don't really think i'm ready to go out yet .
i don't think it would be fair to you .
maybe when i'm a little more settled .
sure .
at your leisure .
i understand .
jesus .
emily's with a new sitter tonight and , of course , i'm a basket case .
that's very sweet .
would you excuse me?
laurel , you know this one .
play .
i can't .
he plays so beautifully .
hey , here .
come on .
come on .
take over .
you're wonderful .
sorry .
i didn't mean to interrupt .
i'm just gonna get a drink .
that's ok .
i was just rubbing this lamp , hoping to change my life .
well , i believe in magic .
in the end , i think it's the only thing that can save us .
you're the piano player .
not any more .
i'm on a break .
a mysterious stranger has temporarily taken over .
i must say , she plays beautifully .
hey .
are your eyes misting over?
this song , it's meaningful to me .
it was playing the night i met someone .
so are they tears of sorrow or tears ofjoy?
well , aren't those the same tears?
yeah .
why do things that start off so promisingly always have a way of ending up in the dump?
not for everyone .
well , for anybody with any imagination .
you know , life is manageable enough if you keep your hopes modest .
the minute you allow yourself sweet dreams you run the risk of them crashing down .
there's plenty of old songs that i cry over .
my name is melinda .
melinda robicheaux .
it's french .
that's a very beautiful name .
thank you .
it's my mother's .
she married a dr nash , so i grew up nash , but i've changed it to her name .
and that is a wise choice .
it's very musical .
my name is ellis moonsong .
i am from harlem , usa .
ellis moonsong .
is that really your name?
yes , it is .
let's go and sit down .
it's wonderful .
you also play beautifully .
well , one thing i could always do was make music .
i can play all the instruments , but my specialty is composition .
i've written two operas .
one was done at yale , i'm proud to say successfully , and the other one is being done in santa fe next summer .
very impressive .
yeah , listen to me brag .
i'm insecure , so i sell myself .
the truth is , not everybody likes the music .
they're kind of modern , but the critics were extremely supportive .
is that what you wanna be another verdi or puccini?
i don't kid myself , you know , but , yeah .
if i could rub that lamp and have my wish ...
operas , symphonies , string quartets .
there's a lot of interest in my work in europe .
i might go to barcelona or to paris to live .
god , i can't stop gushing about myself .
you've opened pandora's box .
and you?
i don't write opera , but my life has been one .
i'm one of those heroines too high strung for existence on this planet , although i brought my worst troubles on myself .
i shouldn't have reached so thoughtlessly for my dreams .
we grab without thinking because we're passionate people .
i knew you were passionate once we started talking .
how?
how?
well , your eyes , your voice .
i got a great instinct about people .
you know , i do .
it's a gift .
let me get right to the point .
can i get to know you better?
i gotta go back and play , but could we have lunch , you know , or dinner?
you can certainly have my number , if that's what you're asking .
let me ...
i'll just get a pen .
there you are .
i saw mr bud silverglide .
the mystery pianist .
mr moonsong , ellis moonsong , this is laurel .
laurel?
i dated a laurel .
she broke my heart .
i wrote this piece of music and i dedicated it to her hoping it would win her back .
let me be the first to tell you , it did not .
he composes serious music .
you two should have a lot to discuss cos laurel gave concerts .
those days vanished with the lost chord .
his opera was a big success at yale and they're doing the other one where?
at the santa fe opera house .
it's great when it's stretched out in front of you .
well , i wish i was as optimistic as you .
well , i'll call you tomorrow .
i'm busy tomorrow .
what's tomorrow?
well , then , i'll call you the day after .
if you feel like it .
what happened with you and the swell dentist?
he was very , very sweet .
very cute .
butjust not for me .
but ellis moonsong is very poetic .
melinda .
things are amazing .
you meet a stranger , and in a sudden rush , you're thinking to yourself , " could i live in barcelona?
be careful .
i mean , you can't go through life rubbing lamps and wishing .
it doesn't work .
take it from me .
hey .
greg earlinger .
hi .
greg earlinger .
i'm susan .
we've met .
this is melinda .
yes , wow .
nice to meet you .
nice to meet you .
so , this is hobie .
you're the gynaecologist .
close .
no , i'm the dentist .
dentist .
dentist .
what were you thinking?
i love it at this time of year .
it's so beautiful .
it's nice when it's so bright , huh?
you know , it's really sexy , isn't it?
you look a little carsick .
why?
cos i'm the colour of guacamole?
this is going well .
look how happy she looks .
i wish we could afford a pad in the hamptons .
everybody who's anybody has one .
but if you're somebody who's nobody , it's no fun to be around anybody who's everybody .
isn't he charming?
and don't tell me he's not gorgeous .
if you like perfect features .
don't be such a crab .
i'm gonna try to come out here more often .
wow , it's so big .
thank you .
it's so clean , too .
it's a great place to entertain , which i love .
god , hobie , isn't it amazing?
yeah , i love the ramp .
it's wheelchair accessible .
that's important out here .
go ahead , guys .
go in .
thanks .
it's tremendous for aerobics .
come on , try it , hobie .
what do you do for exercise?
tiddlywinks .
and an occasional anxiety attack .
try it , hobie .
it's good manners .
since when do i have good manners?
what is that?
is it a pig?
i don't know .
hey , greg , did you shoot this?
well , actually , i shot all of those .
twice a year i go to africa .
the experience would take your breath away .
huge herds of kudu greater kudu and lesser kudu .
which is bigger?
the greater or the lesser?
hobie !
i think it would be the sexiest thing to sleep under the stars in the middle of the jungle ...
if you don't mind waking up with a python in your sleeping bag .
no , no .
the whole thing is very civilised .
they have beds and bathrooms and showers .
but no elevators .
in case you're being chased by a tiger and you have to get up into a tree .
i'd have to take the elevator .
i don't understand .
me neither .
did you shoot all the furniture?
so , melinda , have you ever shot a gun?
how quickly was it shot?
freshly shot?
right here?
that's fine .
this was fun .
thank you .
are you sure you'll be all right?
i'm fine .
do you wanna come up for a drink?
a drink !
yeah , we could do that .
we can't .
you have to get up early .
why?
i'm out of work .
hey , do you have any tequila?
i make the world's most potent margarita .
they're very strong .
i sure do .
are you all right?
here , can i help you?
very good .
you know this car so well .
he's like an old man .
thank you .
i'm fine .
it's like we're dancing .
tequila's on the surgeon general's list .
just be quiet .
why'd he stop twice to get the car washed?
god , he's incredible , isn't he?
it'd be great for melinda if things worked out .
i wouldn't let that guy fill my teeth .
i mean , anyone who gets his jollies putting holes in animals ...
the ernest hemingway of the root canal set .
he's probably got her in bed by now .
i didn't think she could stand him .
not every woman falls for that phoney social rap , you know , with the haut brion and special cheeses and backgammon trophy .
someone must blow him up with an air hose .
you know what?
can we just not discuss it?
and , frankly , i thought you acted like a clown .
now , can i talk to you for a minute?
and try not to get upset .
what?
you wanna spend more time in the hamptons whether i go with you or not?
i told you steve walsh is gonna co produce my film .
yes , that's fantastic .
i figured out a great way to play the psychiatrist .
it's fresh .
with a limp .
i do a great limp , and that will account for his crushing insecurity .
that way , when i make a pass at rosalie , i expect the rejection .
you won't be able to play the shrink .
why not?
steve wants a name .
i have a name on my driver's licence .
he won't go with an unknown .
you're the director .
you say what goes .
without him , there's no film .
but i'm the perfect psychiatrist .
you said it .
i think i can find something else for you in the script .
like what?
what about moe flanders?
you'd be a natural .
you're more flanders than you are the shrink .
flanders?
the retarded elevator operator with the cleft palate?
is that how you see me?
when have i said you had a cleft palate?
help !
my god .
that's melinda .
he's raping her .
probably put novocaine in her margarita .
help !
help !
what is it?
what's wrong?
what's wrong?
i got a tick !
there's a tick in my leg .
where's greg?
he's a dentist .
he doesn't do tick extractions .
his beeper went off .
he had some kind of emergency .
someone saw a rhino on sixth avenue and they needed a hunter .
get it out !
quick !
please !
please !
i don't know how .
in the bronx we had mice .
you need a doctor .
you can't pull it out cos the body comes out and the head stays in .
i feel terrible .
i think i'm gonna faint .
take her to the emergency room .
there's a tick inside me sucking my blood !
it's not sucking your blood .
those are leeches .
but this is disgusting enough .
i'm so sorry .
it was so nice of you to come and hang with me .
that's ok .
actually , i love watching a live creature being pulled out of somebody's body at 3 . 30am .
if that happens again , please call me .
it was really nice of you this whole day .
it's obvious you don't care much for the beach .
it's not the beach so much as the ocean , the sand and the seagulls and things like that .
well , go .
you've had a long day .
rest .
call me .
i'm over here if you need me .
ok?
but try not to panic .
the screaming frightened me .
and you would be totally cool if you had a live insect crawling around under your skin?
i wouldn't enjoy it , but i wouldn't panic .
that's good because there's one in the back of your neck .
my neck?
your neck .
my neck?
yes .
right here .
it's ok .
get it off !
get it off me !
relax .
ok .
this is exciting .
i've never been to the races before .
here's a horse called broadway melody .
i think that's a lucky name .
well , it's not very sensible to pick horses by their names , but i guess it's romantic .
that was so beautiful .
there is no more sublime music than that second movement .
laurel cannot listen without crying .
her eyes are all red .
i'm with her .
when raphael first laid eyes upon the sistine chapel he passed out .
aren't you gonna find us a taxi?
yeah , let's go .
she's head over heels in love with him .
he's gifted , sensitive .
he is unfazed by the details of her past .
he is , in fact , moved by her suffering .
even the awful story she's been reluctant to tell but feels that she must .
i killed him .
but it was an accident .
no .
in my defence , i will say i was out of my mind on drugs .
i shouldn't say drugs .
pills .
pills to help me sleep at night , pills to keep me awake , whatever i could get my hands on to sweep my various pains and anxieties under the rug .
but if i'm honest about it , i did mean to do it .
no .
i denied it in the trial , of course .
but the fact is , i ...
i couldn't think of what else to do .
i thought about killing myself .
why i didn't , i can't say .
it would have been much more rational .
i thought about killing his girlfriend .
maryanne was her name .
maryanne lane .
and it was ...
it was so easy buying a gun .
i just drove out of state and i walked into a store and i bought one .
there were no questions asked .
i bought a box of bullets and i loaded it like i'd been handling one my whole life .
it was all very premeditated , despite what my attorneys would have everyone believe .
and then i drove back to where he worked .
it was next to a christian science reading room .
i remember that .
and i just waited out the front for him to come out .
and even that wasn't very difficult .
there was a slight drizzle , i remember that , but the wait wasn't interminable .
and then when he came out and walked to his car , i simply confronted him .
and he said some very cold and cruel things to me , and i shot mr san giuliano
as i had planned to .
as i had planned .
well , they must have felt the circumstances were extenuating if you got off so lightly .
it may seem lightly to you , but it was nothing but hell .
and if you've never been arrested and put on trial , well , that alone is sentence enough .
the horror , the ... the tension , the police , the journalists ...
i went over my story hundreds of times the jilted mother , seduced away from her family , sick on drugs , the struggle for the gun , the gun goes off .
but there was no struggle .
that was legal fiction .
well , you had good lawyers .
not like your child custody team .
i rememberjust lying in my cell at night and thinking ,
my god .
you are melinda nash from park avenue .
what the hell are you doing in a women's prison in illinois?
so , naturally , after i got out i decided to end it all .
what do you want?
i want to want to live .
everybody wants to live .
now that i met you , i'm feeling a little more positive about it .
congratulate me .
i just got canned .
my version differs from theirs .
they would have you believe i couldn't hold my liquor , which anyone who knows me knows is a baseless canard .
lee , i knew this would happen .
you did?
well , why didn't you tell me?
i'm angry and disgusted .
i mean , christ , can you blame them?
thank you for the emotional support .
i'll see you around .
hey .
hi .
you all right?
you seem a little glum .
lee got fired .
what happened?
it was the producer .
they'd always wanted a name .
they got nervous cos ticket sales were slow .
i'm sorry .
i know the realities of the marketplace .
yeah .
so , what are you gonna do?
i don't know if i should feel sorry for myself or shop to blot out my depression .
neither .
come with us .
with you?
sure .
i'm taking melinda to a recording session .
bartk .
no ...
it'll take your mind off things .
you love bartk .
they're doing a quartet .
you remembered?
come on .
do i have time to change?
you look fine .
look at me .
i feel so grungy .
i've been working all day .
all right , but hurry , then we'll get a coffee .
ok .
it's beautiful , isn't it?
they're so good .
i could never decide between the piano and the cello .
the result is i play them both badly .
and the viola .
i heard you play the piano .
you're good .
no .
yes .
full of feeling .
you have a lovely touch of the keys .
i can see a person's soul by their intonation on an instrument
keyboard , horn or strings .
i can .
it's a gift .
you saw my soul?
right off the bat .
that first party , when you sat down next to me to play , the minute you touched the keys the chord went through me like a knife .
i don't dare ask you what you saw .
it's great .
although i find the more turbulent parts a little scary .
he's still not home .
come to dinner with us .
no , i can't .
come on .
it's gonna be fun .
we'll go down to this little bistro downtown west .
it's very quiet , very dark , very french .
i haven't been to a dark bistro since college .
you'll love it .
i've fallen in love there .
no more for me .
melinda was the fast , advanced one .
come on .
all the men were crazy for her .
they were drawn to her .
her unpredictability .
no , laurel was the star of our group .
i remember how jealous everyone was when you married lee .
lee was the most attractive , most charismatic actor .
my god .
you almost broke cassie's heart , not that she'd ever admit it .
forgive me .
am i being too open here?
it's just i feel great .
what is this?
it's a haut brion .
my head is swimming .
but it feels good .
you were the first one in our group to sleep with a man .
you were so very sophisticated .
i admired it .
i did .
yeah , well , it was probably true .
i had a deep hunger for physical intimacy .
a hunger that could not be denied .
not once adolescence descended and the hormones kicked in .
melinda had a reputation for being postmodern in bed .
life is short .
that was a sobering discovery i made when my mother killed herself .
short , and not about anything except what you can touch and what touches you .
whereas i ...
i've only made love with one man in my life .
lee was the first and lee was the whole story ever since .
that's perfect .
no , i mean it .
i think there's something almost mystical about two people who only know each other .
and , really , you're both very alike .
you know , you're both very , very passionate women .
you're poured into one person , and you've wanted to live out different experiences .
is that you?
no .
no , i think it's me .
so , i got a message .
that was peter .
i think he's got some news about my children .
would you excuse me for a minute?
yeah , go ahead .
i was determined not to ask you what you saw when you looked right through to my soul when we met .
but i wanna know .
something very clouded and protective , with lots of longing .
there was ...
wow , there was a great longing in the notes you played .
that's as accurate a diagnosis as a shrink would make .
it took you a much shorter time .
you sat down and pressed the keyboard , and i thought , " who is this lovely creature with the melancholy touch on the keyboard?
then i saw your wedding ring , and i thought , you know , story of my life .
is that the story of your life?
well , it's the main chapters .
my first impression was , he's handsome , he's lost , he's got inscrutable eyes ...
melinda would like him .
speaking of melinda .
i don't dare say this , but it looks hopeful .
god .
i almost wish this opportunity hadn't come up , you know .
i just don't know if i can handle the tension .
i mean ...
just say it doesn't work out .
it will .
you have to think positively .
she's right .
you were correct when you said that life is short and not about anything , but one thing i do know is that we were not put on this earth to be dragged all the time .
we should go .
i was hoping that you could come by my class one afternoon and lecture the students .
it would be so meaningful to them .
i'd love to .
i'm a good lecturer .
i just hope i'm not a better lecturer than a composer .
you're home .
i'm sorry , laurel .
i really messed things up .
yes , well , you really have to get a handle on your drinking .
yes .
and i will .
of course , now the boat sailed .
made you some dinner .
i ate .
where were you?
i had some late meetings at school .
i don't know what to do .
and you're sure?
yes .
it was there in his talk , in his eyes .
and you flirted back?
yes .
i was outta control , letting him know i was there for him .
god .
poor melinda .
i don't wanna hear about poor melinda .
other people's lives are falling apart .
peter and i suspected it was not going well with lee .
does everyone?
am i gossiped about?
god , that poor girl .
don't worry .
i'm not gonna do anything .
you already have .
if you get divorced , there'll be lots of men .
peter and i can help .
no .
i'm not gonna be the pathetic single friend getting introduced to some dentist .
you're gonna act on this .
i see it .
i don't know what to do .
i can't stop thinking about melinda .
she just knocked on our door carrying her neurosis in her arms .
now i can't get her out of my mind .
come on .
you're married .
i know .
i know that .
i'm consumed with guilt .
i dream of myself kissing melinda .
then i'm on trial at nuremberg .
how does melinda feel?
i haven't been able to tell her that .
the subject of infidelity's out of the question .
you don't know if she feels the same?
no , i think she does .
i just haven't had a chance to pursue it .
i mean , walt , here's the thing .
my marriage has been on the decline for a long time .
we hardly ever sleep together .
the last time we did susan just lay there staring into the darkness as if her parents had been killed in a fire .
well , why can't you just tell her it's not working any more?
i don't wanna hurt her .
i couldn't fire my podiatrist who operated on my wrong foot .
maybe you should go back to your shrink .
he'd just recommend prozac .
i think he has stock in the company .
maybe you're using susan as an excuse .
no .
yes .
maybe you don't even really wanna do it .
no , cos if there was a button i could push to be with melinda but not hurt susan , i'd do it .
tell me this .
how wise is it to get involved with a woman with melinda's track record?
that's why i'm convinced i'm in love with her , because there's no logical reason to be .
be a man .
be honest with susan .
i don't know ...
that's what you have to do !
be honest with her .
she'll live , you'll live .
then you go out , you buy melinda a nice little bauble
i heard her say that she likes art deco
take her out , confess your feelings .
you sure?
yeah .
that's the way .
this is gonna crush susan .
how you doin '?
the deco pin there .
how much is that?
that's $150 .
could you giftwrap that for me?
yes , of course .
i wish i could be with melinda without hurting my wife .
hobie , what are you doing here?
now , don't get upset .
hobie , i think you should know that steve and i have become attracted to one another .
you have?
if you punch me in the nose , i'd understand .
he came here to be with me while i told you .
you have to admit , things have run out of steam between us .
i just ...
try to understand .
i do .
i think we've been drifting a ...
wait .
you do understand?
i do .
most definitely .
you're having an affair with steve walsh .
he's wonderful .
he's clever .
he's smart .
he's fabulously wealthy .
i know .
i just want you to know i don't want anything .
i know how tough your work has been for you , and we've decided steve is just gonna help with all the legal expenses , and i just want everything to be as painless and as civilised as possible .
you know , i think that we can always be friends .
melinda .
hobie .
can you meet me for a few minutes?
there's something i'm dying to tell you when you get off work .
you know that little french bistro on the corner of tenth avenue?
the little candlelightjoint , near where you work .
are you sure you should be drinking so much without having any lunch?
well , we worked through lunch .
i was doing a voice over commercial .
it's not what i envisioned when i was at northwestern .
they still talk about my portrayal of king lear .
i played it with a limp .
how are you liking the job at the gallery?
well , my boss is great .
she has amazing taste .
good .
i mean , it's not a very high paying job , but it's fantastic cos i have plenty of time to think about what i wanna do with my life .
well , i'm glad you said that .
god , you look very pretty in this candlelight .
i'm sure anyone would look amazing with all this flickering shadows and all the wine you're drinking .
right .
right .
well , i'm drinking because life moves so fast .
so unpredictably .
you know , it's over so fast and in the end , what is it?
chekhov said a soap bubble .
did i tell you i played uncle vanya once?
with a limp .
it was interesting .
you know , it's funny that you should say " unpredictable " , because i was walking home yesterday .
i have to tell you this story .
so , some people were moving into an apartment on 90th street .
and they were moving this piano , so there was this piano just , you know , sitting in the middle of the sidewalk .
and i couldn't resist the temptation just to go up and give it a little tinkle .
i play a little piano .
i used to play in high school .
i actually gave some concerts .
anyway , i'm playing this piano .
i'm playing this little tune that my mother taught me .
and this ... this guy came up and started talking to me .
hi .
hi .
that's good .
you play the melody .
all right .
is that what you're trying for?
exactly .
good .
so , his name is billy wheeler , and he's a piano player .
and he also writes pretty music .
and he walked me back to my apartment and he invited me out on a date .
and
i think i'm in love .
in love?
well , i mean , i'm exaggerating , of course , but some bell definitely went off .
a bell?
one of those bells that now and then rings , as mr cole porter put it .
so , anyway , i just thought that you would be pleased to know .
so , what is it that you wanted to tell me?
i don't ...
it doesn't matter .
ok .
this situation is perfect he's despondent , he's desperate , he's suicidal .
all the comic elements are in place .
now she's going out with billy wheeler , and hobie's the single upstairs neighbour .
now she's fixing him up .
we must know somebody for hobie .
the woman who owns your art gallery?
phoebe's married .
i don't need to meet anyone .
i'm fine just staying in my room and ...
and what?
moping?
get out and reinvest your emotion .
don't indulge your depression .
hey .
stacey fox .
why not?
who?
she recently broke up with some wall street guy .
she's bright and great looking .
what does she do?
investment .
one of those business suits who makes love to you on a conference call .
she's no stereotype .
she posed for a feature for playboy on naked political conservatives .
well , uh , i don't know if that's his type .
she's probably got augmented cleavage .
she's anybody's type .
come on .
wednesday's halloween .
we were gonna go out .
you should meet stacey .
i think she just broke up .
hobie agrees to being fixed up , but he's still madly in love with melinda .
he dreams about her all the time .
he's consumed with jealousy .
he can't bear the thought that she might be making love with another man .
he wants to know !
but he doesn't wanna know .
it's driving him crazy .
did you hear something?
i heard something at the front .
can you just go check the door?
make sure it's locked .
what is it?
what's the matter?
i need to talk to you .
you look terrible .
what happened?
i think laurel and ellis are having an affair .
what?
i'm going crazy .
i just ...
take it easy , will you?
i don't know what to do .
well , what makes you think so?
i just know it , ok?
i've been through this once before .
laurel is supposed to be my closest friend .
but what makes you think that something's going on?
i thought it was my paranoia .
then last week i was coming home from house hunting .
ellis was out of town .
and i overheard this argument between laurel and lee .
what's this?
what?
whose key is this?
who's a?
a?
whose keys are in our bathroom?
who was here?
i don't know .
you were with someone .
laurel .
you had a woman here !
i can't listen to these accusations .
you slept with someone here?
leave me alone .
i can't get into another big discussion of my life .
just because i was up here with someone talking , doesn't mean we went to bed .
i am finished with this , lee .
you're a fine one to talk .
what does that mean?
you'd love to call it quits now your eye's on someone else .
what?
you throw yourself at melinda's boyfriend .
don't try and turn this around !
i'm amazed she tolerates it .
you're mixing things up cos you were caught .
no , you were caught .
i know you when you slip into your seductive mode .
i'm not gonna have this stupid conversation !
don't worry , i won't be around much longer .
and then you can feel free to pursue whoever you want !
from that moment , the demons set in .
i just couldn't sleep .
doesn't matter how many pills i take .
i just feel myself consumed with suspicion and i'm ashamed of it .
melinda ...
cassie , you know it's true .
i can see it in your face .
look , you have to pull yourself together .
you've been popping pills .
you've been drinking ...
stop avoiding answering me .
i don't know anything .
i called ellis today .
he's not where he said he'd be , so i called laurel's school .
she'd called in sick .
clearly , she's not home sick .
listen , even if your worst fears were true , you can'tjust go off the deep end .
i pick up the phone extension .
i have to know .
at the same time , i don't wanna know .
listen , you cannot give yourself over to fantasies .
let's find out the reality first , and stop drinking .
for god's sakes , it's not even noon yet .
god .
i have an appointment with your husband at noon .
well , you're gonna be late .
i'm afraid the news is not good .
no?
my partner gave it everything he had , but the politics of the situation is just too difficult .
your ex husband is very well connected and very determined to keep the children from you .
naturally , the criminal conviction didn't help .
it's funny .
i steeled myself for this result , but now that it's come ...
you know , i know this will sound very pollyanna , but it's true .
when they grow up , they will want to know who their mother was and get to know you .
my guess is they'll be quite angry at their father for his unreasonableness .
you'll see .
they'll grow up and come to you .
well , i'm certain that they will .
i'm sure that they'll take after me and look very much like my mother .
my mother was a very gifted interior decorator .
and i studied art , so i've always had this flair for graphics .
can i get you anything?
no , i just hope that you'll be sending some of your clients to me when i get more established , you know .
did i tell you that my mother ... my mother ... my mother was a very gifted interior decorator?
she was very talented .
she did some amazing houses on the upper west side .
melinda ...
there's been no easy way to handle this situation .
i think we need to talk .
no , these situations are never easy .
i'm sorry , melinda .
i really am sorry .
it's just ...
we planned to tell you , but each of us was so bewildered as how to approach it .
bewildered .
it's not like we planned on it happening .
we were going to explain things as soon as we figured out the best approach .
i loved you .
i don't have a satisfying explanation .
you know , these things happen .
living is messy .
my head is spinning .
i need to lie down and rest .
i wanna close my eyes and never open them again .
i'm going out the window .
ellis .
meli ...
what are you doing?
i'm going out !
cassie?
melinda has to come and stay with you for a while .
no , there is no other answer .
she has to be watched , and it's awkward with me and ellis under the circumstances .
well , i can't be responsible either .
let's face it , cassie .
she's one of those people who will always need help .
it's sad , but we have to move on with our lives .
you killed her .
you killed her as i am about to kill you .
come , vitus .
are we men or are we children?
of what use ...
so , what do you think?
she's gorgeous .
hard to believe a republican could be that sexual .
i bet she could put your portfolio in order .
i thought you didn't like to dance .
i'm just trying to be a good sport .
i think it'd only be fair to tell you , i'm a liberal .
are you talking politically or in the bedroom?
i was talking politically .
in the bedroom , i'm a left wing liberal .
in the bedroom , i'm a radical .
look , can i level with you?
in the past few months of my marriage i really didn't sleep with my wife .
we weren't sleeping at all .
i ...
so it's , ... you know .
i'm a little out of practice .
politically speaking , i'm ready for a little affirmative action .
what do you say we blow this joint and go back to your place?
my place?
yes , by all means .
it'd be great .
this is like a drea ...
so you're not gonna hold the fact that we have conflicting viewpoints on the direction america should take against me?
i mean , i'd hate to get all worked up and then we find we differ on a tax cut .
come on .
i haven't made love in a while either .
yes .
i will never vote against school prayer again .
hey , what are they up to?
what do you think?
so much dancing .
that was so much fun .
you'll have to forgive the disarray .
my cleaning woman won $168 million in the lottery and she asked for the day off .
ajoke .
you must get depressed sleeping alone .
the truth is , i frighten myself .
i'm always worried burglars are gonna break in .
i bought a baseball bat .
oh , drinks .
i know the feeling of being dumped .
except in my case , it was between my fianc and my best friend .
no !
yes .
i'd known her all my life .
we were school mates .
we went through everything together .
she was the one who was responsible for my meeting my fianc .
it's a sad story .
it's awful .
do you mind sleeping on cotton sheets?
i know you posed for playboy on satin .
i couldn't help noticing how they'd always make eye contact .
i thought i was paranoid , but i should have trusted my instinct .
always go with your gut feeling .
sometimes i would pick up the phone after it would ring , and there'd be no one .
but they were signalling each other .
stacey .
making love , meeting secretly , laughing at me ...
i'm sure they weren't laughing at you .
we were moving in together .
looking for an apartment together , to live together .
i loved him .
i'm sure .
my closest friend knew that .
she knew how much i cared about him .
she knew my whole life was wrapped up in him .
of course .
should i dim the lights?
maybe a little jazz .
do you like jazz?
i can't bear it .
i can't bear to think about it .
don't think about it .
you know , life is so rotten , so cruel , and then , finally , about nothing .
we can just stretch out on the carpet if you ...
i can't stand it !
i'm going out the window .
what?
i'm going out the window .
stacey , wait !
are you crazy?
stacey ...
stacey .
leave me alone .
i wanna end it all !
no , no , no !
stop it !
stop it !
stop it !
please !
let's talk about what ...
jeez .
god !
please , let me go .
let me go !
kiss me .
i love you .
kiss me .
please .
my gosh .
what a dream .
melinda !
what ...
what are you doing here?
my god .
i was listening at your door .
for what?
i was jealous .
jealous?
jealous of what?
well ...
you went home with stacey , and all night long i've been upset .
so i guess i've realised how much i care for you .
really?
is she here?
i heard lovemaking talk .
no , that was a dream .
you were dreaming about her?
i was dreaming of you , actually .
me?
why were you dreaming about me?
i dreamt i was making love to you .
really?
melinda ...
i'm in love with you .
me?
you never said anything .
i was married , and when it was breaking up you met bill .
my god .
couldn't you tell i've been in love with you for a long time?
i couldn't even tell that i was in love with you .
and now you're spying on me .
what a silly thing a grown woman , a mature , sophisticated woman , outside a door , spying .
by the way , i found a piece of your bathrobe in my door .
strange .
i should tell my laundress .
you don't have a laundress .
well , marry me and we'll get a laundress .
so , you see , it's all in the eye of the beholder .
we hear a little story , a few hearsay details .
you mould them into a tragic tale a woman's weakness for romance is her undoing .
and that's how you see life .
whereas you , you take those details , you put them into an amusing romance .
great .
that's your take on life .
but , obviously , there is no one definitive essence that can be pinned down .
well , moments of humour do exist .
i exploit them .
but , you know , they exist within a tragic overall framework .
is everybody going to phil dorfman's funeral next week?
he dropped dead of a heart attack .
he just had his cardiogram , which was perfect .
i hate funerals .
me too .
always , at the wrong time , i laugh .
see , that's my point .
we laugh because it masks our real terror about mortality .
i didn't mean to bring up the subject of funerals .
well , how can it be a romantic , funny world if you can't trust your own cardiogram?
i wanna be cremated .
now?
or after your death?
let's change the subject .
we came out to have a fun and relaxing evening .
let's drink to good times .
comic or tragic , the most important thing to do is to enjoy life while you can because we only go round once , and when it's over , it's over .
and , perfect cardiogram or not , when you least expect it , it could end like that . ... like that !
