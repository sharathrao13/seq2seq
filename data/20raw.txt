the old father tells me ... you'll be up and around in a few days .
you're very lucky ... to have me so close when it happened .

do you ...
do you have parents , blondie?
a mother?
not even a mother .
no one .
you're all alone , huh?
like me , blondie .
we're all alone in the world .
i have you .
you have me .
only for a little while , i mean .
it had to happen now .
what a dirty , rotten trick of fate .
we could have all that money ... in our hands ... now .
i ...
i must tell you the truth , blondie .
in my place , you would do the same thing .
it's all over for you now .
there's nothing anyone can do anymore .
oh , god , look at me .
it's my fault .
mine .
mine .
mine .
mine .
i'll tell you one thing , blondie .
if i knew that my last hour had come ...
i swear , in my place ... in your place ...
i would do the same thing .
i would tell about the gold .
yes .
yes , i would .
i'd tell the name on the grave .
after all , what good is the money to you ... if you're dead?
i know the name of the cemetery ... but you know how many graves there are there?
please ...
blondie ...
please , have a little .

you dirty ...
i'll sleep better ... knowing my good friend is by my side ... to protect me .
tuco , water . " here's water ... but if i get that name from you ...
i'll give you water .
all right , you dirty skunk ... get your ass off the bed .
come on , come on , the party's over .
the wagon is all ready to go .
from the way the wounded ... are pouring into this place ... we'd better get the hell out of here ... before we get caught up in the war .
tuco , father ramirez is back .
there's something i have to look into .
it'll only take a minute .
get moving .
where?
this way?
yes .
hey .
hey , pablo?
hey ...
hey .
don't you recognize me?
heh heh heh heh .
it's me !
it's tuco !
let me embrace you !
oh ... ooh .
l ...
i don't know the right thing .
i was just passing by here .
i said to myself ...
i wonder if my brother remembers his brother?
did i do wrong?
it doesn't matter .
i'm very happy .
you have seen me , tuco .
yeah , well , i'm ...
i'm very glad i came .
uh ...
oh , my uniform !
it's a long story .
but let's talk about you .
it's more important .
you look very well .
hmm , a bit thin perhaps , but ...
ha ha ha ha !
you were always thin , eh , pablito?
well ...
what about our parents?
only now do you think of them .
to begin after nine years .
nine years?
so , it's nine years .
ha ha ha ha !
nine years !
our mother has been dead a long time now .
our father died only a few days ago .
that's why i was away .
he asked for you to be there .
but there was only me .
and you?
outside of evil ... what else have you managed to do?
it seems to me ... you once had a wife someplace .
not one .
lots of them .
one here .
one there .
wherever i found them .
go on .
preach me a sermon , pablo .
what good would that be?
just keep on the way you're going .
go away .
and the lord have mercy on your soul .
sure , i'll go .
and while i'm waiting ... for the lord to remember me ...
i , tuco ramirez ... brother of brother ramirez ... will tell you something .
you think you're better than i am .
where we came from ... if one did not want to die of poverty ... one became a priest or a bandit .
you chose your way .
i chose mine .
mine was harder !
you talk about mother and father .
you remember , when you left to become a priest ...
i stayed behind .
i must have been 10 , 12 ...
i don't remember which ... but i stayed .
i tried , but it was no good .
now i will tell you something .
you became a priest ... because you were too much of a coward to do what i do .
ugh !
tuco .
please forgive me , brother .
hyah .
ah , my belly's full .
nice guy , my brother .
i didn't tell you ... my brother was in charge here?
everything .
like the pope almost .
he's in charge in rome .
yeah , yeah , my brother ... he say to me , " stay , brother .
don't go home .
we never see each other .
here there's plenty to eat and drink .
bring your friend , too .
whenever we see each other ... he never lets me go .
it's always the same story .
my brother ... he is crazy about me .
that's so .
even a tramp like me ... no matter what happens ...
i know there's a brother somewhere ... who will never refuse me a bowl of soup .
sure .
well , after a meal ... there's nothing like a good cigar .
whoa .
look .
whoa .
hey , wake up , you .
the troops are coming .
blue or gray?
huh?
they're gray like us .
let's say hello to them and then get going .
hoorah !
hoorah for the confederacy !
hoorah !
down with general grant !
hoorah for general ...
what's his name?
lee .
lee .
lee !
hey , god is with us ... because he hates the yanks , too !
hoorah !
god's not on our side ...
'cause he hates idiots also .

bill carson .
bill carson?
i said bill carson !
hey , blondie .
isn't that angel eyes?
all right , what's he doing ... sleeping?
bill carson !
yeah .
and you better be bill carson .
bill carson !
yeah ... yeah ... that's me .
please , carson ... answer " present .
hmm .
what are you , deaf?
ugh !
now suppose you say " present , " carson .
i like big fat men like you .
when they fall , they make more noise .
and sometimes they never get up .
wallace ...
that's enough .
sergeant !
the captain wants to see you right away .
be sure these two get good treatment .
hey , blondie , did you hear that?
good treatment .
yeah .
for the last time , sergeant ...
for the last time , sergeant ...
i'm telling you i want the prisoners ... treated as prisoners .
no more brutality .
there's hundreds of prisoners out there ... and only a few men to guard them .
now what am i supposed to do?
i have to have respect .
i think that you'll manage to gain their respect ... by treating them better .
are our men treated that well ... in andersonville camp?
i don't give a goddamn ... what they do in andersonville .
while i'm in charge here ... the prisoners are not to be tortured ... or cheated ... or murdered .
that an accusation?
sergeant , gangrene is eating my leg away ... not my eyes .
i know the prisoners here ... are being robbed systematically .
i know there's scum around ... who are bivouacked near the camp ... waiting for someone to deliver this loot .
but as long as i'm commandant ...
i won't permit any such trickery .
am i clear?
yes , sir ... just as long as you're the commandant .
yes , sergeant .
i know this leg means i won't last very long ... but i pray i can manage to have enough time ... to amass evidence ... and bring to a court martial ... all those who discredit and dishonor ... the uniform of the union .
i wish you luck .
you and the others ... better lay low for a few days .
no , i'll keep this .
you go .
wallace will let you know .
wallace ... bring me carson .
right .
listen , angel eyes said ... for us to lay low for a few days .
but we'll keep close enough to keep an eye on things .
come on , saddle your horses .
get in .
get in .
huh?
come on in , tuco .
don't be bashful .
there's no formalities here .
it's been a long time .
you're hungry .
sit down .
eat .
heh , i knew it , i knew it .
the minute i saw you , i said to myself ...
look at that pig angel eyes .
i'll bet he got himself an easy job .
and he never forgets a friend .
i never forget old friends , tuco .
uh , right .
it's good to see old friends again .
good .
especially when they've come ... from so far away .
we have so much to talk about .
mm hmm .
and you do have a lot to talk about ... haven't you?
you were captured near , uh ...
fort craig .
mm hmm .
mm hmm .
well , if you were with sibley ... that means then that you , uh ... were coming from santa fe .
mm hmm .
was it hard crossing the desert?
mm hmm .
very hard .
especially if you don't have anything to drink .
why are you going under the name ... of bill carson now?
one name is as good as another .
not wise to use your own name .
like you !
i'll bet they don't call you angel eyes .
ha ha .
sergeant angel eyes .
like a little music with your meal , tuco?
music?
yes , it's very good .
very good for the digestion .
so ...
bill carson's a fake name , huh?
hmm .
that fake , too?
bill carson's name's written on it .
have some .
it's bill carson's tobacco .
aah !
aagghh aagghh .
was carson dead or alive when you found him?
what'd he tell you about the money?
i ... don't ...
i ...
i don't know ... what you're talking about .
aah !
more feeling .
you can sure consider yourself ... much luckier than your pal .
wallace will punch your friend ... as long as the song goes .
so many of us have had a session in there .
ohh .
ohh .
how's your digestion now?
you'd better talk .
i have nothing to tell you .
aah !
play that fiddle , you .
a aaah !
aah aahh !
i ...
i ta ...
i talk .
what did he say about the money?
it's b ...
it's b ...
it's ... buried in a grave .
where?
sad hill ...
sad hill ...
sad hill cemetery .
which grave?
i d ...
i don't know .
i don't know , i tell you .
blondie ...
ask ...
blondie .
he knows ... the name of the grave .
blondie ...
blondie .
blondie .
the war's over for you .
put those clothes on .
why?
we're going for a ride .
where?
to find $200, 000 .
i know the name of the cemetery now ... and you know the name of the grave .
you're not going to give me the same treatment?
would you talk?
no .
probably not .
that's what i thought .
not that you're any tougher than tuco ... but you're smart enough ... to know that talking won't save you .
and tuco ... is he ...
mm mmm .
no .
not yet .
but he's in very good hands .
you've changed partners ... but you still got the same deal .
i'm not greedy .
i'm only taking half .
there's two of us .
it should make it easier than just one .
yeah .
hold it .
that's it .
don't move .
now don't breathe .
still ... that's it .
ahh ...
got it .
thank you .
hey , corporal , afraid he'll get lost?
where's the rebel going?
to hell , with a rope around his neck ... and a price on his head .
yeah .
three thousand dollars , friend .
that's a lot of money for a head .
i'll bet they didn't even ... pay you a penny for your arm .
i told you once , friend ... if i ever get you down ... you're gonna need a lot of help to get up again .
you're a lot luckier than that one there .
you'll get some proper rope ... and you're all finished .
and there isn't any partner this time to shoot you down .
get up .
sure would like to put your paw on it , huh?
i would like to piss .
it's rough .
i've been shaken up on this train ... nearly ten hours now .
you smell like a pig already ... but let's try not to make things any worse .
get going .
i can't while you're watching me .
aah !
you made a lot of noise , my friend , huh?
you don't want to break our friendship , huh?
well , i'll break it .
halt .
take your places .
ready !
aim !
fire !
slim , take care of the horses .
hmm .
i been looking for you for eight months .
whenever i should've had a gun in my right hand ...
i thought of you .
now i find you in exactly the position that suits me .
i had lots of time to learn how to shoot with my left .
when you have to shoot , shoot .
don't talk .
every gun makes its own tune .
and it's perfect timing , large one .
clem .
follow him .
tsk tsk tsk .
hey ... oop !
hey ... oop !
just a minute .
i'll be right there .
just give me a little time ... to get dressed , and i'll open up .
put your drawers on and take your gun off .
hey ...
hey ...
hey , blondie .
how the hell did you get out of that pigsty?
my own way .
i'm here with your old friend angel eyes .
you talked , you traitor .
you talked .
no , i didn't talk .
if i did , i probably wouldn't be here now .
you ... mean ... so only you know ... your half of the secret?
mm hmm .
ahh ... ha ha ha , blondie !
i'm very happy ... you're working with me ... and we're together again .
i get dressed , i kill him ... and be right back .
oh , listen , uh ...
i forgot to mention ... uh , he's not alone .
there's five of them .
five?
yeah , five of them .
so that's why you came to tuco?
it doesn't matter .
i'll kill them all .
they shot him at close range .
well , look who's here .
the other one will be along .
they'll come looking for us .
watch out .
there's two of them .
i want that blond alive .
you , back there .
come on , let's go .
were you gonna die alone?
halt !
hey , blondie ...
angel eyes is mine , huh?
