enough's enough , curly .
you can't eat the venetian blinds , i just got them .
down the hatch .
she's no good .
what can i tell you?
when you're right , you're right .
and you're right .
i'll pay you the rest next week .
we only caught 60 tons of skipjack .
they pay less for skipjack than albacore tuna .
i only brought it up to illustrate a point .
i don't want your last dime .
thank you , mr gittes .
call me jake .
careful driving home .
mrs mulwray is waiting for you , with mr walsh and mr duffy .
mrs mulwray , may i present mr gittes .
mrs mulwray , how do you?
mr gittes .
what seems to be the problem?
my husband ...
i believe is seeing another woman .
no ... really? .
i am sorry .
mr gittes , do you think we could discuss this alone?
i'm afraid not .
these are my operatives ,
and at some point they'll have to assist me .
i can't do everything myself .
of course not .
what makes you certain that your husband is involved with someone?
a wife can tell .
do you love your husband?
yes , of course .
then go home and forget everything .
i'm sure he loves you too .
let sleeping dogs lie?
you're better off not knowing .
i have to know .
very well .
what is your husband's first name?
hollis .
hollis mulwray .
water and power? .
he's chief engineer .
chief engineer? .
this type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook .
it takes time ...
money doesn't matter to me .
okay , we'll see what we can do .
today you can hop a streetcar , and in 25 minutes , you end up in the pacific .
you can swim in it and fish in it , but you can't drink it .
you can't irrigate an orange grove with it .
we live next door to the ocean , but we also live on the edge of a desert .
los angeles is a desert community .
beneath this building is a desert .
without water , the dust will rise up cover us as though we never existed .
the alto vallejo can save us from this .
i suggest that 8 million dollars is a fair price to pay
to keep the desert from our streets , and not on top of them .
mayor bagby ...
let's hear from all the departments again .
we'd better take water and power first .
mr mulwray? .
in case you've forgotten , over 500 died when the van der lip dam gave way .
this shale is similar to the permeable shale in the van der lip disaster .
it couldn't withstand that kind of pressure .
now you propose another dirt banked dam ,
with slopes of 2 to 1 , 1 12 feet high , and a 12 000 acre water surface .
well , it won't hold .
i won't build it , it's that simple .
i'm not going to make the same mistake twice .
what the hell are you doing?
get those goddam things out of here !
tell me where to take them !
you don't have an answer for that .
you steal water from the valley , ruin the grazing , starve the livestock ...
who's paying you to do that , mulwray? .
that's what i want to know !
save your clty los angeles is dylng of thlrst vote yes
jeez , he was there all night .
that's right .
i had to go back three times to pick up the watches .
yesterdayhe went to three reservoirs , a men's room , and the pig & whistle .
the guy's got water on the brain .
so what have you got?
this?
they got into a terrific argument .
what about?
i don't know .
the traffic was loud .
apple core " .
apple core?
yeah .
is that what you spent the day doing?
you said to take pictures , so i did .
let me explain something to you , walsh .
this business requires a certain amount of finesse .
what is it , sophie?
duffy's on the phone .
duff , where are you?
the buzzard's got a cute little twist .
slow down .
where are you?
they're in echo park , in a rowboat !
okay ...
echo park .
water again .
okay , pal , let's have us a big smile .
you'll love it .
when you get this much publicity , you're practically a movie star .
look at that , barn .
yeah , the heat's murder .
fools 'names and fools 'faces .
what's that , pal?
you've got some way to make a living .
what do you do to make ends meet?
mortgages .
first national bank .
did you foreclose on many families this week? .
we don't publish records in the paper .
neither do l .
no , you have your press agent do it .
is this bimbo a regular customer? .
i make an honest living .
i help people when they're in a desperate situation .
i don't kick families out of their houses like you bums at the bank do .
maybe you'd like to go outside and discuss it .
what do you think? .
let me tell you about the guy ...
i don't know how it got in the paper .
i make an honest living .
of course you do .
anyway , this guy got tired of screwing his wife .
so his friend says he should do what the chinese do ...
duffy .
hey , walsh !
sophie , go to the little girls 'room for a minute .
but mr gittes ...
yes , mr gittes .
i want to tell you a story .
there's a guy who's tired of screwing his wife ...
jake , there's a problem .
wait a second .
his friend says to do it like the chinese do it .
how do the chinese do it?
well , first they screw a little bit , then they read a little confucius ,
come back , screw a little bit more , then they stop again ...
jake !
walsh , just listen , you'll love this .
they go back and they screw a little bit more ,
and then they contemplate the moon .
it makes it more exciting .
so now the guy goes home and starts screwing his own wife .
so he screws her a little , then goes out of the room and reads life magazine .
he goes back in and screws her a bit , then goes out and smokes a cigarette .
his wife is sore .
hey , what's the matter with you?
you're screwing just like a chinaman !
jesus , that barney ...
mr gittes?
yes .
do you know me?
well ...
i think i would have remembered .
have we ever met?
well , no .
never? .
never .
that's what i thought .
i'm mrs evelyn mulwray .
mr mulwray's wife .
not that mulwray? .
yes , mr gittes .
that mulwray .
and since you agree that we've never met before ,
you must also agree that i never hired you to spy on my husband .
i see you like publicity , mr gittes .
well , you're going to get it .
there's been some misunderstanding .
there's no need to get tough with me ...
i don't get tough with anyone .
my lawyer does .
here's something for you , mr gittes .
i suppose we'll be hearing from your attorney .
mr mulwray? .
he's not in , mr ..?
may i ask what it's regarding?
it's personal .
has he been gone long?
since lunch .
gee whiz , and i'm late .
he was expecting you?
15 minutes ago .
i'll go in and wait .
sir !
could i help you?
russ yelburton , deputy chief .
j. j. gittes .
it's not a departmental matter .
would you care to wait in my office?
certainly .
we're a bit nervous , with all this business in the papers
about mr mulwray .
right this way .
after you've worked with a man for a certain length of time ,
you come to know his habits and values .
either he's the kind who chases after women , or he isn't .
mulwray never even kids about it .
maybe he takes it very seriously .
sit down .
no , thank you .
where is he having lunch?
i'm sorry , i don't know .
well , tell him i'll be back .
i will .
do you mind if i take one of your cards , in case i have to get in touch with you?
mulvihill , what are you doing here?
they shut my water off .
so what?
how'd you find out?
you don't drink it , you don't take a bath in it ...
they wrote you a letter ...
but then you'd have to be able to read .
relax , glad to see you .
do you know claude mulvihill?
i hope so , he's working for us .
doing what?
there's been threats to the reservoirs .
any particular reason?
rationing .
the farmers are desperate .
but the city needs drinking water .
well , you're in luck .
when he was sheriff , the rum runners landed tons of booze on the beach
and never lost a drop .
he ought to be able to hold on to your water for you .
j. j. gittes to see mr mulwray .
please .
you wait .
bad for glass .
yeah , sure .
bad for the glass .
mr gittes .
actually , i came to see your husband .
something to drink? .
what are you having?
iced tea .
that'll be fine , thank you .
my husband's at the office .
actually , he's not .
and he's checked out of his apartment at the ei macondo .
that's not his apartment .
anyway , the point is , i'm not in business to be loved ,
but i am in business .
whoever set your husband up , set me up .
l. a. is a small town .
people talk .
i don't want to become a local joke .
you've talked me into it .
i'll drop the lawsuit .
what?
let's just drop the whole thing .
sugar , lemon , or both?
both ...
i don't want to drop it .
i better talk to your husband .
why? .
hollis seems to think you're an innocent man .
i've been accused of a lot of things , but never that .
someone's gone to a lot of trouble , and i intend to find out .
i'm not supposed to be the one caught with his pants down .
unless it's a problem , i'd like to talk to your husband .
may i speak frankly , mrs mulwray? .
you may if you can , mr gittes .
that little girlfriend .
she was pretty , in a cheap sort of way , of course ...
she's disappeared .
maybe they disappeared together .
if they did , how does that affect you?
it's nothing personal .
it's very personal .
it couldn't be more personal .
is this an obsession with you?
let's look at it this way ...
this phoney broad , excuse the language , tells me she's you .
whoever put her up to it isn't after me , they're out to get your husband .
if i can see him , i can help him .
did you talk to him this morning?
no .
i went riding rather early .
it looks like you went quite a distance .
i was riding bareback .
you might try the oak pass or the stone canyon reservoir .
he often takes walks .
otherwise he'll be home by 6 : 30 .
i'll stop by .
please call first .
sorry , closed to public .
that's all right , officer ...
russ yelburton , deputy chief of the department .
sorry , mr yelburton .
go on down .
gittes , get out before he sees you .
loach , what's going on?
hello , jake .
lou .
how are you?
lousy cold i can't seem to shake , but otherwise i'm okay .
summer colds are the worst .
yeah , they are .
there's no smoking here .
we'll make an exception this time .
i'll see he's careful with the matches and doesn't burn himself .
how'd you get past the guard?
to tell you the truth , i lied a little .
you look like you've done well .
i get by .
sometimes it takes a man a while to find himself .
maybe you have .
yeah , going through other people's dirty linen .
tell me , you still putting chinamen in jail for spitting in the laundry? .
you're a little behind the times .
they use steam irons now .
and i'm out of chinatown .
since when?
since i made lieutenant .
congratulations .
what are you doing around here?
i'm looking for somebody .
hollis mulwray .
you seen him?
yeah .
i'd like to talk to him .
you'd like to talk to him ...
you're welcome to try .
there he is .
it looks like he was washed down the entire length of the run off channel .
could he swim?
of course .
obviously , the fall must have knocked him unconscious .
mrs mulwray , this alleged affair your husband was having ...
the publicity didn't make him morose or unhappy? .
it didn't make him happy .
he couldn't have taken his own life?
no .
do you happen to know the name of the young lady in question?
no .
or where she might be?
you and your husband never discussed her? .
we did .
he wouldn't tell me her name .
we quarrelled over her , of course .
it came as a complete surprise to me .
a complete surprise?
i thought you hired a private investigator .
a private investigator? .
mr gittes .
yes , but i did that to put an end to a ridiculous rumour that had no basis .
when did mr gittes inform you that the rumours had some foundation in fact?
just before the story broke in the papers .
you wouldn't happen to know where i could find her ... or her name?
no .
of course not .
will you need me for anything else?
no , i don't think so .
if we need any more information we'll be in touch .
of course you have my deepest sympathy .
i'll see her to the car , lou .
i'll be right back .
jake , what's the story? .
take it easy .
we better do this in a hurry ...
give us a little room !
you want a picture , guys?
here it is .
gittes " , two ts and an e.
thank you for going along with me back there .
i just didn't want to explain anything .
i'll send you a check .
a check? .
to make it official that i've hired you .
i'll have it this afternoon ...
jake , what are you doing here?
it's my lunch hour , morty .
i thought i'd drop by and see who'd dropped dead .
middle of a drought , and the water commissioner drowns .
only in l. a. looks pretty banged up .
well , it's a long fall .
so how are you doing , morty? .
never better , except for this cough .
you know me , jake .
yeah .
so who have you got there?
leroy shuhardt .
local drunk .
used to hang around ferguson's alley .
quite a character .
lately he's been living in a downtown storm drain .
had a bureau dresser down there and everything .
he drowned too .
come again?
got drunk .
passed out in the riverbed .
the l. a. river? .
yeah , what's wrong with that?
it's dry as a bone .
it's not completely dry .
he ain't gonna drown in a damp riverbed , no matter how soused he is .
we got water out of him .
he drowned .
hello .
howdy .
you were riding out here the other day , weren't you?
do you speak english?
habla lngles?
si .
you were talking to a man a few days ago .
he wore glasses ...
what did you talk about?
the water .
what about the water? .
when it comes .
what did you tell him?
it comes in different parts of the river .
every night a different part .
son of a bitch .
goddam florsheim shoe .
hold it there , kitty cat .
hello , claude .
where'd you get the midget?
you're a very nosy fellow .
know what happens to nosy fellows?
no?
wanna guess?
no?
okay .
they lose their noses .
next time you lose the whole thing .
i'll cut it off and feed it to my goldfish .
understand?
understand?
i understand .
so a contractor wants to build a dam and makes a few pay offs .
so what?
you can't nail mulvihill .
they'll claim you were trespassing .
i don't want mulvihill .
i want the big boys that are making the pay offs .
then what'll you do?
sue the shit out of them .
what is it , sophie?
a miss sessions is calling .
who?
ida sessions .
don't know her .
take a number .
people like that will be having dinner with the judge who's trying the suit .
i'm sorry .
miss sessions insists .
she says you know her .
okay .
hello , miss sessions .
i don't believe we've had the pleasure .
oh yes we have .
are you alone?
isn't everyone?
what can i do for you?
well , i'm a working girl .
i didn't come in to see you on my own .
when did you come in?
ipretended to be mrs mulwray .
shut the fuck up ...
yes , i remember .
is something wrong?
i was just checking with an associate .
go on .
i never expected all this to happen .
ifitgets out , i wantsomeone to know thatl didn't know what would happen .
i understand .
who was your employer? .
it would be helpful to both of us .
oh , no .
no .
what's your address?
maybe we could talk this over .
justlook in the obituary column oftoday's l. a. post record .
you'll find one ofthose people .
sure ...
how do you like them apples?
thank you for coming .
yes , sir? .
drink? .
tom collins with lime , not lemon .
i got your check in the mail .
as i said , i was very grateful .
i'm afraid that's not good enough .
how much would you like?
oh , stop it .
the money's fine .
but i think you short changed me on the story .
something else besides the death of your husband was bothering you .
you were upset , but not that upset .
don't tell me how i feel .
sorry .
you sue me , your husband dies , you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato .
all of it quicker than the wind from a duck's ass .
excuse me ...
then you ask me to lie to the police .
it wasn't much of a lie .
if he was killed , it was .
this could look like a pay off to withhold evidence .
but he wasn't killed .
mrs mulwray , i think you're hiding something .
i suppose i am .
actually , i knew about the affair .
how did you find out?
my husband .
he told you?
and you weren't in the least bit upset?
i was grateful .
you'll have to explain that .
why? .
when a wife tells me she's happy that her husband is cheating on her ,
it runs contrary to my experience .
unless what?
she was cheating on him .
were you?
i dislike the word " cheat " .
did you have affairs?
did he know about it?
i wouldn't run home and tell him whenever i'd been to bed with another .
anything else you want to know? .
where were you when hollis died?
i can't tell you .
you don't know? .
i can't tell you .
you were seeing someone too .
for very long?
i don't see anyone for very long .
it's difficult for me .
now , i think you know all you need know about me .
i didn't want publicity .
i didn't want to go into all of this then , or now .
is that all?
oh , by the way ...
what does this " c " stand for? .
cross .
that's your maiden name?
yes .
why? .
no reason .
you must have had a reason to ask .
no , i'm just a snoop .
no , i have my own car .
the packard .
wait a minute , sonny .
i think you better come with me .
there's nothing more to say .
get my car , please .
okay , but in case you're interested , your husband was murdered .
someone's been dumping thousands of tons of water from the reservoirs ,
and we're supposedly in a drought .
he found out about it and he was killed .
there's a drowned drunk .
involuntary manslaughter , if anyone took the time .
it seems like half the city is trying to cover it up , which is fine by me ,
but i goddam near lost my nose .
and i like it .
i like breathing through it .
and i still think that you're hiding something .
mr gittes ...
j. j. gittes to see mr yelburton .
mr yelburton will be busy for some time .
well , it's my lunch hour .
i can wait .
he's liable to be tied up indefinitely .
i take a long lunch hour .
all day , sometimes .
noah cross worked for the company? .
yes ...
no .
did he or didn't he?
he owned it .
he owned the water department?
yes .
you mean , he owned the entire water supply for the city? .
how'd they get it away from him?
mulwray felt the public should own it .
mr mulwray? .
i thought you said cross owned it .
along with mr mulwray .
they were partners?
yes , they were partners .
mr yelburton will see you now .
mr gittes , sorry to keep you waiting .
these staff meetings just go on and on .
it must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances .
yes , hollis was the best department chief the city ever had .
what happened to your nose?
cut myself shaving .
that must really smart .
only when i breathe .
only when you breathe ...
don't tell me you're still working for mrs mulwray? .
i never was .
i don't understand .
neither do i , actually .
you hired me .
or you hired that chippie to hire me .
you're not making a bit of sense .
mulwray didn't want to build a dam .
his reputation was hard to get around .
you decided to ruin it .
then he found out you were dumping water at night .
then he was ... drowned .
that's an outrageous accusation .
i don't know what you're talking about .
well , whitey mehrholtz over at the times will .
dumping thousands of gallons of water in the middle of a drought is news .
mr gittes ...
we're not anxious for it to get around , but we have been diverting water
to irrigate orange groves in the northwest valley .
they have no legal right to our water , but we've been trying to help them out .
when you divert water , there's a little run off .
yeah , a little run off ...
where did you say those groves were?
in the northwest valley .
that's like saying they're in arizona .
my field men are out , i can't give you the exact location .
you're a married man , aren't you?
hard working , wife , kids ..?
yes .
i don't want to nail you .
i want to find out who put you up to it .
i'll give you a few days to think on it .
call me , i can help .
who knows , maybe we can put the whole thing off
on a few big shots , and you can stay head of the department for 20 years .
drink? .
no , thank you .
what is your usual salary? .
$35 a day , plus 20 for my associates .
plus expenses , plus a bonus if i show results .
whoever killed my husband , why have they gone to all this trouble?
money .
how they plan to make it emptying reservoirs , i don't know .
i'll pay your salary , plus $5, 000 ,
if you find out what happened to hollis , and who is involved .
sophie , draw up one of our standard contracts for mrs mulwray .
were you married before mulwray and your father sold the water department?
noah cross is your father , isn't he?
yes , of course .
it was sometime after .
i was just out of grade school when they did that .
then you married your father's business partner .
you've already got one going .
does my talking about your father upset you?
no ...
yes , a little .
you see , hollis and my fa ... ... my father had a falling out , finally .
over you or the water department?
why should it be over me?
then it was over the water department .
hollis felt the water should belong to the public .
i think my father disagreed .
actually , it was over the van der lip dam .
the dam that broke .
hollis never forgave him for it .
never forgave him for what?
for talking him into building it .
they never spoke from that time on .
you sure about that?
of course i'm sure .
sign here .
the copy's for you .
mr gittes?
how do you do?
you got a nasty reputation .
i like that .
thanks .
you're not a bank president .
in your business it's good advertising .
it doesn't hurt .
it helps get a client like my daughter .
probably .
i'm surprised you still work for her .
unless she's suddenly come up with another husband .
she happens to think the last one was murdered .
how did she get that idea?
i think i gave it to her .
i hope you don't mind .
i believe they should be served with the head .
as long as you don't serve the chicken that way .
tell me , what do the police say? .
they're calling it an accident .
who's the investigating officer? .
lt. lou escobar .
you know him?
oh , yeah .
where from?
we worked together , in chinatown .
would you call him a capable man?
very .
honest?
as far as it goes .
he has to swim in the same water we all do .
but there's no reason to think he's bungled the case?
too bad .
too bad?
it makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride ,
financially speaking , of course .
what are you charging her? .
my usual fee , plus a bonus if i get results .
are you sleeping with her? .
you have to think about that to remember? .
if you want an answer to that question , i'll put one of my men on the job .
good afternoon .
mr gittes ...
she's just lost her husband .
i don't want her taken advantage of .
sit down .
what for? .
you may think you know what you're dealing with , but believe me , you don't .
why is that funny? .
the da used to say that in chinatown .
was he right?
exactly what do you know about me?
sit down .
you're rich , and too respectable to want your name in the newspapers .
of course i'm respectable .
i'm old .
politicians , ugly buildings and whores get respectable if they last a long time .
i'll double your fee and pay you $10 000 if you find hollis's girlfriend .
girlfriend?
disappeared , hasn't she?
wouldn't it be useful to talk to her? .
maybe .
if he was murdered , she may be the last to see him alive .
when was the last time you saw him?
sheriff's gold posse .
damn fools .
they paid $5, 000 apiece toward the sheriff's re election .
i let them practice up here .
do you know when you last saw him?
at my age you tend to forget .
five days ago , at the pig & whistle .
you had one hell of an argument .
i got the pictures in my office , if that'll help you remember .
what did you argue about?
my daughter .
what about her? .
just find the girl , mr gittes .
i know hollis was fond of her .
i'd like to help her if i can .
i had no idea you and hollis were that fond of one another .
hollis mulwray made this city , and he made me a fortune .
we were a lot closer than evelyn realised .
if you want to hire me , i still have to know what the argument was about .
my daughter's veryjealous .
i didn't want her to find out about the girl .
how did you find out?
i've still got a few friends in town .
okay ...
i'll have my secretary draw up the papers .
are you frightened for the girl or what evelyn might do to her? .
just find the girl .
i'll look into it , as soon as i've checked out some orange groves .
orange groves?
we'll be in touch , mr cross .
could you tell me where the plat books for the northwest valley are?
part of it's in ventura county .
we don't have them in our hall of records .
then i'll settle for l. a. county .
row 23 , section c.
weasel .
sonny , why do they have all those names pasted in the plat books?
land sales out of escrow are recorded within the week .
then these are all new owners?
that's right .
that means that most of the valley's sold in the last few months .
can i check one of these volumes out?
this is not a lending library , it's the hall of records .
how about a ruler? .
a ruler? .
the print's fine , and i left my glasses at home .
i'd like to be able to read across .
i thank you .
hold it right there !
all right , quit it now !
search the man , see if he's armed .
i didn't tell you to empty his pockets .
search him !
he ain't armed .
who are you with , the water department or the real estate office?
get away from me !
come near me with that again , you'll need a pair of them !
pick on somebody your own size .
give him a chance to say something .
the name's gittes , private investigator .
i'm not with either one of them .
what are you doing out here?
a client hired me to see if the water department was irrigating your land .
the water dept . 's been sending people out here to blow up my water tanks .
they put poison in my wells .
that's a funny way to irrigate .
who'd hire you for a thing like that?
mrs evelyn mulwray .
that's the one who's done it to us .
mulwray's dead .
you don't know what you're talking about , you dumb okie .
well , that's that .
what's going on?
you didn't look good .
we thought we better call your employer .
thanks for coming .
that dam your husband opposed is a con job .
they're conning l. a. into building it , but the water's coming here , not to l. a.
everything you can see .
all around us .
i was at the hall of records today .
in the last three months , robert knox has bought 7, 000 acres .
12 000 .
5, 000 .
25, 000 acres .
jasper lamar crabb?
i think i would have remembered that name .
they're blowing the farmers out and then buying their land for peanuts .
you know what this land would be worth with a steady water supply? .
about 30 million more than they paid for it .
hollis knew about this?
that's why he was killed .
jasper lamar crabb ...
we got it .
what is it?
a memorial was held at the mar vista lnn for jasper lamar crabb .
he passed away two weeks ago .
is that unusual?
he passed away two weeks ago .
one week ago he bought the land .
that's unusual .
hello , i'm mr palmer .
can i help you folks?
yes , i hope so .
it's dad .
i can't handle him anymore .
my goodness .
it's nothing with dad , it's me .
dad's an angel with everyone else .
but when he and my h ...
i don't know .
of course , i'm anxious for him to have the best .
money is no object .
perhaps if we met with your father .
there is one question ...
do you accept people of the jewish persuasion?
i'm sorry , but we don't .
neither does dad .
we had to be sure .
would it be possible to see a list of your patients , just to be certain?
we never reveal the names of our guests .
it's policy .
you'd agree if your father lived here .
exactly what i wanted to hear you say .
is it too late for us to look around?
no , allow me to show you .
could we stroll on our own?
yes , if you stay in the main building .
it's almost bedtime .
we understand .
come , my sweet .
charley , you ought to know better than that .
they're all there .
every goddam name .
you're looking at the owners of a 50 000 acre empire .
they may not know it , but they are .
hello , girls .
are any of you emma dill?
are you emma?
i've wanted to meet you a long time .
why? .
did you know you were very wealthy? .
i'm not .
you own a lot of land .
no more .
some time ago , my late husband owned a lot of beach property ,
but we lost it .
that's very beautiful .
where did you get this piece of material?
at the albacore club .
albacore .
it's a fish .
my grandson is a member .
they take very nice care of us .
how do they do that?
give us things .
not just a flag , but ...
but what?
we're an unofficial charity to them .
would you come with me?
someone wants to talk with you .
goodbye , ladies .
i want you to meet someone , gittes .
can we leave the lady out of this?
yeah , why not .
i'd like to see her to the car .
she knows where it's at .
i'll stay .
get in the car .
maid's night off?
why? .
because nobody's here , that's why .
i gave everyone the night off .
easy , it's an innocent question .
no question from you is innocent .
i guess you're right .
to you , mrs mulwray .
frankly , tonight you saved my a ... you saved my neck .
tell me , mr gittes , does this often happen to you?
what's that?
i'm judging only on part of today , but if this is how you go about your work ,
i'd say you'd be lucky to get through a whole day .
this hasn't happened for a long time .
when was the last time?
why? .
it's an innocent question .
in chinatown .
what were you doing there?
working for the district attorney .
doing what?
as little as possible .
the da gives you advice like that?
they do in chinatown .
why did you leave the police force?
do you have any peroxide , or anything like that?
surely .
come this way .
god !
that's a nasty cut .
i had no idea .
sorry !
is it painful?
it must be painful .
what's wrong?
your eye .
what about it?
there's something black in the green part of your eye .
oh , that .
it's a flaw in the iris .
a flaw? .
yes , it's a sort of birthmark .
did you wear a uniform?
sometimes .
you must have looked cute in blue .
give me a break , will you?
i want to know more about you .
not now .
you really don't like to talk about the past , do you?
i'm tired .
why does it bother you to talk of it?
it bothers everybody who works there .
where?
chinatown .
everybody .
to me it was just bad luck .
why? .
you can't always tell what's going on .
like with you .
why was ...
why was it bad luck? .
i was trying to keep someone from being hurt .
i ended up making sure that she was hurt .
cherchez la femme .
was there a woman involved?
of course .
dead?
yes , hello?
oh , my god !
don't do anything .
don't do anything until i get there .
i have to go .
where?
it's just that i have to .
i want to know where you're going .
don't be angry .
it has nothing to do with you or any of this .
where are you going?
please ...
trust me this much .
i'll be back .
there is something that i should tell you
about the fishing club that old lady mentioned .
the albacore club .
it has to do with my father .
i know .
he owns it ...
you know? .
i saw him .
you saw ... my father? .
when?
this morning .
you didn't tell me .
well , there hasn't been much time .
what did he say? .
what did he say? .
that you were jealous .
that he was afraid what you might do .
to whom?
mulwray's girlfriend , for one .
he wanted to know where she was .
i want you to listen to me .
my father is a very dangerous man .
you don't know how dangerous .
you don't know how crazy .
are you trying to tell me that he might be behind all of this?
it's possible .
even the death of your husband?
it's possible .
now please , don't ask me any more questions .
just wait for me here .
i need you here .
give me the keys .
you .. !
it's either that or you drive yourself to the police .
come on , mrs mulwray .
you have your husband's girlfriend tied up in there .
she's not tied up .
you're holding her against her will .
i am not .
okay , then let's go talk to her .
no !
she's too upset .
what about?
hollis's death .
i tried to keep it from her until i could make plans for us to leave .
she just found out about it?
that's not what it looks like .
what does it look like?
like she knows more than you want her to tell .
you're insane .
tell me the truth .
i'm not the police .
i don't care what you've done .
i don't want to hurt you .
you won't go to the police if i tell you?
i will if you don't .
she's my sister .
take it easy .
if she's your sister , she's your sister .
why all the secrecy? .
i can't ...
is it because she was seeing your husband? ls that it?
i'd never have harmed hollis .
he was the most gentle , decent man imaginable .
and he put up with more from me than you'll ever know .
i wanted him to be happy .
i borrowed your husband's car .
i'll bring it back in the morning .
aren't you coming back with me?
don't worry , i won't tell anybody .
that's not what i meant .
yeah , well ...
i'm tired , mrs mulwray .
good night .

let me think on it .
i'll get back to you .

this broad hired you , not evelyn mulwray .
somebody wanted to shake mulwray down .
she hired you .
that's how you found out he was murdered .
i heard it was an accident .
you think we're a bunch of assholes?
mulwray had salt water in his lungs .
you tailed him day and night .
you saw who killed him .
you even took pictures .
it was evelyn mulwray .
she's been paying you off ever since .
you accuse me of extortion?
you're dumber than you think i think you are .
i wouldn't extort a nickel from my worst enemy .
i want the pictures .
accessory after the fact , conspiracy and extortion .
you think evelyn killed her husband in the ocean ,
then dragged him up to a reservoir to make it look more like an accident?
he was moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean .
he found out they were dumping water and trying to cover it up .
what the hell are you talking about?
come on , i'll show you .
come on , lou , you're in charge .
make a decision .
it's too late .
they only dump the water at night .

he says ...
i know what he says .
shut up !

he says there's irrigation in the valley , and there's always a little run off .
he says gittes knows this , and that he's made irresponsible accusations .
let's get a warrant for her arrest .
what are we waiting for? .
he just made lieutenant .
he wants to hang on to his little gold bar .
have her in my office in two hours .

no worry , i can recommend a couple .
they're expensive , but you can afford it .
will you please tell me what this is all about?
i found these in your backyard , in the pond .
they belonged to your husband , didn't they? .
i don't know .
yes , probably .
positively .
he was drowned there .
what?
there's no time to be shocked .
the coroner proved he had salt water in his lungs when he was killed .
i want to know how it happened , and why ,
before escobar gets here .
i don't want to lose my license .
i don't know what you are talking about .
this is the craziest ...
stop it !
i want to make it easy for you .
you were jealous , you had a fight .
he hit his head .
it was an accident .
but his girl is a witness .
so you had to shut her up , and you had the money to do it .
yes or no?
no !
who is she?
she's not your sister , you don't have one .
i'll tell you the truth .

i wanted to but i ...
i couldn't .

i want to take care of her .

she flew the coop .
and you've no idea where she went?
as a matter of fact i do .
her maid's house .
she knows something's up .
what's the maid's address?
she lives in pedro .
i'll write it down ...
no , gittes , you're gonna show us .
what for? .
because if she ain't there , you're gonna stay downtown until she does show up .
gee lou , i'm doing the best i can .
tell us about it on the way to san pedro .
let's get the little lady .
can i ask you a favour? .
i'd like to bring her out myself .
she's not armed , she won't be a problem .
i just want a minute alone with her .
it would mean a lot to her , and to me .
you never learn , do you , jake?
i guess not .
okay ...
i'll give you three minutes .
just three minutes .
gee , thanks , lou .
hello .
mr gittes , come in !
this is some surprise .
call me jake .
how you doing , curly? .
care to join us?
no , thanks .
a glass of wine?
this is the fella ...
i know .
no , thank you .
but i'd like a glass of water .
come out in the kitchen with me .
curly , where's your car? .
in the garage off the alley .
can you give me a ride somewhere ..?
right now .
it can't wait .
i'll tell my wife .
tell her later , curl .
just drive slow for a block or two .
what's this all about?
i'll tell you in a block or two .
how much do you owe me?
gee , we're going out tomorrow .
you've been good about it , but my cousin's sick .
how would you like to pay me off by taking two passengers to encenada?
you'd have to leave tonight .
i don't know .
i might be able to squeeze 75 bucks out of it for you .
maybe even 100 .
plus what i owe?
i'll throw that in too .
1 712 alameda .
wait for me until 8 : 30 .
if i don't show , take them to your boat .
you're sure this is okay? .
do you know how long i've been in this business?
have you got your checkbook handy , mr cross?
i've got the girl .
you've gother?
where?
remember the figures we discussed?
yes .
where are you?
your daughter's house .
how soon can you get here?
an hour .
there you are !
well , you don't look too much the worse for wear .
where's the girl? ls she all right?
she's fine .
well , where is she?
with her mother .
i've got something i'd like to show you .
what is it?
an obituary column .
can you see all right in this light?
i guess i can manage .
what does it mean?
that you killed hollis mulwray .
right here .
in that pond .
you drowned him , and you left these .
the coroner's report shows mulwray had salt water in his lungs .
hollis was always fascinated by tide pools .
you know what he used to say? .
i haven't the faintest idea .
that's where life begins , tide pools !
he figured that if you dumped water into the desert sand
and let it percolate down to the bedrock ,
it wouldn't evaporate the way it does in reservoirs .
you lose 20/ o , not 80/ o .
he made this city !
you were gonna do that in the valley? .
i am doing it .
when the bond issue passes tuesday
there will be eight million dollars to build a reservoir .
people will be mad when they find out they're paying for water they won't get .
that's all taken care of .
you see ,
either you bring the water to l. a. or you bring l. a. to the water .
how are you gonna do that?
i'll incorporate the valley into the city .
how much are you worth?
how much do you want?
are you worth over ten million?
oh , yes .
why are you doing it?
what can you buy that you can't already afford?
the future , mr gittes .
the future .
now where's the girl?
i want the only daughter i've got left .
as you now , evelyn was lost to me a long time ago .
who do you blame for that?
her? .
i don't blame myself .
most people never have to face the fact
that at the right time and the right place , they're capable of anything .
claude , take those glasses from him .
not worth it , mr gittes .
it's really not worth it .
take us to the girl .
you remember night train claude mulvihill?
these are my associates ...
you're under arrest , jake .
good news .
withholding evidence , extortion , accessory after the fact .
i didn't extort nothing from nobody .
this is noah cross .
evelyn's father .
he's the bird you're after .
i can explain everything in five minutes .
he's rich !
he thinks he can get away with it .
you shut up , or i'll lock you up .
i am rich , i am noah cross .
evelyn mulwray is my daughter .
he's crazy , lou !
he killed mulwray because of the water thing .
just listen !
lock him to the wheel of the car .
you don't know what's going on here .
katherine !
i am your grandfather , my dear .
i am your grandfather .
no , go on .
i'll follow you .
get away from her .
get away !
evelyn , please ... be reasonable .
come to my ...
get away from her !
how many years have i got?
she's mine , too .
she's never going to know that .
you're a disturbed woman .
you cannot provide ...
evelyn , let the police handle this .
he owns the police !
get away from her .
you'll have to kill me first .
close the door .
halt !
get the captain .
get an ambulance .
turn them all loose .
lord ...
oh , lord !
as little as possible .
what's that?
what's that?
you wanna do your partner a big favour? .
take him home .
take him home .
just get him the hell out of here !
go home , jake .
i'm doing you a favour .
come on , jake .
forget it , jake .
it's chinatown .
all right , clear the area !
on the sidewalk .
on the sidewalk !
get off the street !
get off the street !
