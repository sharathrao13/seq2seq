this is relating to the recall ofamerican troops from abroad .
tragedy struck today as a charter aircraft carrying an army unit returning from duty injapan crashed this morning ... says secretary of the treasury rittenhouse is resigning because his wife is sick .
so who passed rittenhouse the hemlock?
afl/ clo wanted him off the council of economic advisors for not supporting the pension bill , and the president's going to need labour next fall .
and state's still fuming
pentagon is unhappy with his readiness reduction proposals .
greenspan dislikes him .
christ , who didn't this guy piss off?
no wonder the wife's sick .
she's not sick , she's a drunk .
how do you know that?
mike woodward over at treasury .
mrs rittenhouse started drinking a couple ofyears ago when her husband had a series ofaffairs .
stepped it up last summer after their son died of leukaemia .
you want to do something on the price that wives pay?
mike woodward?
wife , 3 kids?
he's been after me for months .
so i threw him a breakfast and hit him up about rittenhouse .
bob campbell's leaving , so midnight saturday anchor shift is opening up .
why would i want to give up the white house for a graveyard weekend
no , no , no , not foryou , for me .
no .
beth .
we'll talk about this later .
very calm .
the president will be back from camp david tomorrow .
business news , lra .
just keep working on rittenhouse .
maybe mike's available for dinner .
do the usual research , background information .
ok , that's it .
beth , wait .
listen , beth , what if it wasn't permanent?
oh , god , jenny , please .
honey , this is how it works .
you've done 2 years of research .
now do 3 as a segment producer .
5 on air doing domestic features , another 2 in some cholera ridden hellhole .
and then i'll quit ifthey don't give you a weekend anchor shot .
hello , caitlin .
there you are .
are you protecting me orjust holding me back?
yes .

i can't .
i gotta go .
i know , i know , i know .
i'm sorry about this .
we'll get over it .
i love you .
i love you , too .
be good .
i was with the secretary since he's been governor of connecticut .
i came to washington with him .
i moved here because i was dedicated to his career .
i trusted the man ... and then he fucked me .
he what?
no , i didn't have sex with him .
i should say i didn't have sex with him , but somebody sure did .
it was about to come out , so he resigned .
but because i was hired from outside the government pool ,
i don't get conveyed to the next secretary , so now i'm out a job ...
because he couldn't keep his hands off women .
do you have proof?
he thinks he was being so clever .
nobody else could answer it .
i picked it up once .
said hello , and it's nobody home .
it rings , he shuts the door .
why not hang a sign?
do you have a name?
this is what i get for talking to the press .
i'm selling my soul right now .
i can feel it .
i can feel it .
i name a name and get someone into trouble .
so you do have a name .
just a fii rst name .
oh , my god .
i'm going to say it .
ellie .
ellie .
nothing else?
i think the president knows about it , too .
overheard the secretary talking to him about her .
isn't washington sick?
hi .
how you doing?
can i help you?
well , actually , we're looking foryour mom .
is she around?
my mom's sick .
she's not here .
gosh , i love boats .
are you going on a trip?
yeah .
that's exciting .
looks like a long trip , huh?
so , listen , do you know where you're going?
she's going back to the house .
hey , you want to stop that?
lily , please .
lily , that's a pretty name .
lily .
do as i say .
go on .
ifwe could just get a minute ofyour time .
what do you want from me?
we'd like to talk about your resignation .
my wife is sick .
she's in the hospital .
that's why i resigned .
everybody knows this .
we could talk about your wife , or we could just talk about ellie .
turn the camera off .
ifyou want to talk to me , turn it off .
we know everything .
nobody knows everything .
well , we know about the secret phone lines and the whispered calls to the president and about a secretary ofthe treasury who's kept his entire department in the dark about what he's really doing about a cover story about his resignation thatjust fell through .
you want me to go on?
and you're just gonna break it?
well , that's what we do for a living .
well , congratulations .
you now have the biggest story in history .
good luck to you .
personally ...
i think it's a mistake to run the story , but hey , what the hell?
why not?
what difference does anything make any more?
look .
i know you'rejust a reporter , but you used to be a person , right?
i wanted to be with my family .
can you understand that?
ok , secretary ofthe treasury alan rittenhouse resigns because ofa mistress named ellie .
the biggest story in history?
what an ego .
now , if it was the president
whoa , whoa , whoa .
the president has a mistress named ellie , and rittenhouse pretends that he's having the affair and takes the fall and resigns , and the president buys him a yacht?
son ofa bitch .
oh , shit .
oh , shit .
right !
ok , ok !
oh , god .
oh , god .
fbl .
ifyou would , please , ma'am .
what do i do with my car?
we'll take care ofyour car .
just step back to my car .
get her car here .
let's go .
would you come this way please?
morton entrekin , ms lerner .
i'm expected back at msnbc at 6 : 00 .
i think i should be there .
people knew about the manhattan project , you know , and they kept it a secret .
that wasjust the creation ofthe atom bomb .
hmm .
ms lerner , tom beck .
i understand you've come into some information .
ms lerner wasjust expressing her lack ofenthusiasm for matters of national security wherejournalistic competitiveness is at stake .
mr president , i'm not interested in using ellie to further my career .
what do you know about e. l. e.?
i know you should have picked a better cover story than a sick wife .
see?
what did i tell you?
we'd always thought the deadline for going public was the publication ofthe budget , since we've spent more money than we can hide .
the budget comes out in 2 weeks .
i don't suppose i could convince you to sit on this for 2 weeks .
no such thing as 2 weeks in the news business .
and i can't appeal to your sense ofwhat's in the nation's best interest?
i always thought the truth was in the nation's best interest .
you want to hold her?
what ifwe go public in 48 hours?
now that's doable , isn't it?
that would be very diffiicult , mr president .
morton , ifshe knows , how long can it be before cnn or the post breaks the story?
this was never gonna be a secret as long as you wanted it to be .
give us 2 days , ms lerner .
you'll get second row , centre , at the white house press conference .
now , from what i know ofyour career , that's a promotion .
i want exclusivity .
now , listen , young lady .
this is a presidential favour .
i'm letting you go because i don't want another headache .
and i'm trusting you because i know what this can do foryour career .
it might seem that we have each other over the same barrel , ms lerner , but itjust seems that way .
i want
want?
may i ...
may i have the fii rst question?
we'll see you tuesday , ms lerner .
come on , come on .
e. l. e. , e. l. e.
paleontology?
paleontology?
what's paleontology have to do with anything?
come on .
hey .
hey .
look who's working late .
how's rittenhouse going?
no sign ofthe wife yet .
is she missing?
no .
we're still working on it .
we'll get there .
i know , it's a dull story .
next time we'll get you something more exciting .
great .
are you ok?
yeah .
want to come to dinner with us?
i can't .
i have plans .
ok .
we'll see you tomorrow .
thankyou .
ah , here she is .
jenny .
hello .
hi , chloe .
would you like some champagne , miss?
martini ... big .
i missed you .
i mean we missed you yesterday .
i must say , i'm ...
i'm disturbed that you didn't come to our wedding .
jason , you promised .
i know i promised , but it was a beautiful event , and i missed her .
you should have been there .
the twins , they were running around like mad and throwing flowers .
it was wonderful , especially emma .
you know , the little one .
she loves you .
it was beautiful .
she missed you , too .
all right .
this is from us foryou .
are you not going to open it?
i knew she wouldn't ...
you can exchange them ifyou don't like them .
jenny , i know this is hard .
i just want you to be happy .
happy .
well ,
i would like to propose a toast to happiness and to
mmm .
mmm .
are we going to have an evening or not?
jenny , i know that you hate me .
i know that you have terrible things that you want to say to me .
you have to get over it .
life goes on .
life goes on?
ok .
what's so funny?
life ...
we'll see .
what's so funny about " life goes on "?
life going on?
i don't think it's funny that life goes on .
dad , you need to get back together with mom .
she's all alone in the world , and she needs you right now .
ok?
jenny .
i just got married .
i know , and i'm sorry .
chloe , this has nothing to do with you .
well , it has to do something for me , for christ's sake .
this is insane .
i have to apologize for my daughter .
it's not your fault .
i'm sorry .
i have to go .
i know you think i'm a bad person .
i'm really not .
and i don't hate you .
i just i gotta go .
'cause for her , it doesn't excuse me .
jenny .
hey .
what are you doing here?
uh , yeah .
did stuart send you here without telling me?
no .
ifstuart thinks he can push me out ofthe white house
ms lerner .
hi , beth .
right this way .
i've got you right down here .
excuse me , please .
ok .
he'll fii nd you for the fii rst question .
then you're on your own .
hey , how are you?
ladies and gentlemen .
ladies and gentlemen , please .
the president will begin by addressing the nation .
please hold your questions until he's fii nished his remarks .
ladies and gentlemen , the president ofthe united states .
hello , everybody .
mr president .
hello .
1 0 seconds , mr president .
5 , 4 .
good evening .
a few minutes ago the united states ambassadors to every country in the world told the leaders ofthose nations what i am about to tell you .
it's a bit complicated , so it will take some time , so i hope you will bear with me , hear what i have to say .
a little over a year ago , 2 american astronomers , marcus wolfand leo biederman , working on a mountain top in arizona ...
shh .
nobody say anything . saw something in the night sky that caused them great concern .
a comet .
but the comet was , well ...
there was a remote possibility that the comet was on a path that could bring it into direct contact with the earth .
now ... we get hit all the time by rocks and meteors , some ofthem the size ofcars , some no bigger than your hand .
but the comet we discovered is the size of new york city .
from the north side of central park to the battery .
about 7 miles long .
put another way , this comet is larger than mount everest .
it weighs 500 billion tons .
now , chances are ...
astrophysicists , geologists and climatologists .
where the hell is science?
check with tokyo , tel aviv .
i want everybody .
the hale bopp stand ups .
graphics !
i need graphics !
comets begin far out in space .
they're what's left over from the creation ofthe solar system after the planets were formed billions ofyears ago .
these chunks ofspace debris are in an elongated orbit around our sun , but every now and then one ofthem gets bumped
iike a billiard ball on a pool table and is knocked into a different orbit .
ifthis comet continues on its path around the sun and keeps its present course , sometime on august 1 6 , roughly a year from now , there's a chance that we might have impact .
so for the past 8 months , the united states and russia have been building the largest spaceship ever constructed .
it's being built in orbit around the earth .
and we call it the messiah .
right now a team ofamerican astronauts and one russian are at cape canaveral in florida .
in 2 months , they will leave on the shuttle atlantis to board the messiah .
this is the crew that will stop the comet .
i'd like the world to meet some extraordinary people .
first is mission commander oren monash .
commander , would you introduce us to your team?
i'd be honoured , sir .
pilot andrea baker .
medical offiicer
gus partenza .
from russia , nuclear specialist
colonel mikhail tulchinsky .
navigator mark simon and rendezvous pilot spurgeon tanner .
hello , mr president .
captain tanner , you flew 6 shuttle missions .
you were the last man to walk on the moon , weren't you?
yes , sir , but oren here will be doing most ofthe flying on this one .
i'll just be taking us down to the comet's surface .
well , it's good to know we're going to have your kind ofexperience up there , captain .
thankyou , sir .
godspeed to you all .
we're counting on you .
thankyou , sir .
got beijing , rome , sao paulo , cairo , berlin !
does anyone know how big the one was that killed all the dinosaurs?
something majestic , mysterious , with a fanfare for the intro and a theme for the longer promos .
you want it hitting the goddam earth?
well , that's what he's saying .
bring that up again .
it'll scare the shit out ofthem .
we will not tolerate any disruption ofour way of life .
our society will continue as normal .
work will go on .
you will pay your bills .
there will be no hoarding .
there will be no sudden profiiteering .
i'm freezing all wages , all prices .
what a bottle ofwater cost you yesterday ... it will cost you tomorrow .
now we'll take a few questions .
mr president !
ms lerner .
ahem .
ahem .
uh, jenny lerner , m msnbc .
jenny lerner?
son ofa bitch .
um , mr president , why wasn't this announcement made sooner?
well , until we knew we could build the rocket and the comet could be intercepted , we saw no reason to alarm the planet .
sir !
mr president !
do you have another question , ms lerner?
yeah .
um ...
is is there a connection between the comet and the recall ofamerican troops from abroad?
our fii ghting men and women are coming home because we felt it prudent , in light ofdomestic security concerns , to have them available .
although i certainly hope we don't need to use them .
next question .
mr president !
actually , mr president , if just one fii nal question , sir .
um ...
msnbc has learned that secretary rittenhouse did not leave for the reasons announced by your administration .
in fact , isn't it true , sir , that not everyone in your administration is convinced that the messiah will save us?
secretary rittenhouse served his country with full devotion .
he resigned for personal reasons .
now , i can promise you this , ms lerner , all ofyou , everyone in this room and everyone listening to my voice , that at some point over the next 1 0 months , all of us will entertain our worst fears and concerns .
but i can also promise you this .
life will go on .
we will prevail .
mr president !
please !
sally .
sir , what is the comet's name?
the 2 scientists who found the comet were killed in a car crash while racing from their observatory to alert the world .
so we named it for them .
wolf biederman .
leo biederman , they said it again .
shh !
leo , is he talking about you?
he is , isn't he?
can you get that , please?
janie , get the door .
well , we have the technology to build the ship .
they have the technology to make it go .
there's someone at the door foryou , leo .
you've been watching live coverage of president tom beck ...
i can't believe this .
this is so weird .
dr wolf from astronomy club?
yeah , i guess so .
i think it's really neat .
nobody on our block discovered the world was gonna end before .
he's still very much alive .
he's still alive , everyone .
he's right here , and he's still alive .
ok?
hey , leo , cool !
as far as we know , what happened was that doctor wolf saw the comet in my photograph , so he shared the discovery with me , and then he was killed in that crash and everything got mixed up in washington , so the president thought i was dead , too .
leo !
leo !
jasmine .
how does it feel having your name on it?
i don't want anyone to think that i'm trying to take something away from dr wolf , because i'm not , but it's kind ofcool .
leo !
leo !
jason .
you know , you're gonna have sex a lot more now than anyone else in our class .
don't listen .
don't .
really?
thankyou foryour sexual insight , mr thurman .
you can sit down now .
famous people always get sex , mr perry .
that's the main reason it's good to be famous .
fruit a reactor , bottle a rocket , ok?
a nuclear reactor in space?
yes .
isn't that dangerous?
no , no , no .
this is all russian design .
russian science .
uh , the same people who designed chernobyl .
chernobyl?
chernobyl almost worked .
so what happens afteryou plant the bomb?
well , we have 7 hours .
we're gonna put the bombs inside the comet .
i'm gonna follow these two .
i don't trust that combination .
after 7 hours , the 1 4 hour rotational cycle ofthe comet spins .
we're gonna get married .
god knows i want to marry you , but the day i get back , the last thing i'm gonna do is step inside ofa church .
i don't do churches well .
'cause there's only 7 hours ofdarkness .
then the sun starts hitting the surface ofthe planet ...
these are your orders .
upon fii rst entering earth's atmosphere , proceed immediately up the exterior ofthe mother ship .
when the sun hits the surface , there's gonna be explosive outgassings that are very dangerous
gus , he's 7 .
brittany .
you boys were , what , 4 and 6 when i went to the moon?
yeah .
now , you saw me go into space 7 times , didn't ya?
i came back every time , didn't l?
yeah .
your mother and i used to play a game when she was still alive .
now , the game was , ifthere was a chance i might not be coming back , she wouldn't say it , and i wouldn't say it .
ok?
yes , sir .
yes , sir .
hey , fish .
how about a beer?
you remember my boys , don't you?
steve and dwight .
ofcourse i do .
gentlemen , welcome to houston .
let me steal your old man for a second .
can i take your picture , please?
ok .
thankyou .
so , what do you think ofthe crew?
heroes all .
that's the fii nest group i ever had the privilege ofworking with .
yeah , yeah .
off the record , huh?
well , they've been trained in ways i'll never understand .
they're smarter and in better shape than we ever were in the old days .
they're sober , serious .
i guess i'd be a little happier about this whole thing if i thought that any ofthem were as scared as i am .
well , they're not scared ofdyin '.
they'rejust scared of looking bad on tv .
now , look , i wish i'd been to the moon .
i got respect for everybody who's gone to the moon , but this mission ain't going to the moon .
that's right .
frank gifford , he was a great football player in his time , but if he played now , he'd get his ass busted .
that's right .
all i'm saying is , the moon did not have a rotational cycle of 1 4 hours .
i mean , we only have 7 hours ofdark when the sun's not up to land on this thing .
it was light when he landed .
this is gonna be dark .
we're not gonna be able to see .
you can't see now , gus .
don't worry , don't worry , don't worry .
we what?
we can do it .
no , no , no .
sit down .
i woke up this morning , and i realized ... none ofyou want me here .
you don't even really know who i am , which is ok .
i walked on the moon , but i didn't belong to you .
i belonged to your daddies .
now , if i askyou to askyour daddies what i meant to them , to explain to you what i'm doing here , that's only gonna make things worse .
so ... what do we do?
you haven't trained for this mission .
we respect you .
i appreciate that .
but you're here ... you're here because the powers that be think we need a familiar face on this trip .
you're here for public relations .
no , no .
i'm here because the powers that be know that i'm the only person on this mission who's ever landed on the moon .
and i have 500 landings on aircraft carriers .
we've trained on
on flight simulators .
right?
i mean , this is not a video game , son .
it really isn't .
it really isn't .
no .
we are go for auto sequence start .
atlantis '4 on board computers now have primary control ofall the vehicle's critical functions .
ok , all flight controllers , we're at t minus 30 seconds and counting .
let's take a close look .
apus look good ,
lox and lh2 are pressurized .
1 0 , 9 ...
we're go for auto sequence .
roger, jerry .
good luck and godspeed , atlantis .
thanks , mitch .
3 , 2 , 1 .
propelled by 500, 000 pounds of liquid fuel , the shuttle crew heads toward their initial destination .
when the crew enters the messiah , they will fii nd a payload of 8 nuclear devices that will eventually be used to blow up the comet .
the messiah itself will be powered by an experimental nuclear propulsion system that was originally created for a very different purpose .
that programme was called orion .
now , with the help of russian engineers , a technology designed to propel weapons of mass destruction will power the ship that will intercept the greatest threat our planet has ever faced .
orion burn ... in 1 0 , 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 , 0 .
ok , beth , white house reactions .
marianne , the whole world watching .
we have enough satellite space?
78 uplinks .
tim , mission control in houston .
ira , the science guys lined up?
ifthey got a ph. d. , we own them .
all right , this is the most important story ofour lives .
let's not muck it up .
stuart , what about me?
you're on the anchor desk .
whoa !
and you could have been there a lot sooner .
what are you talking about?
you know what i'm talking about .
don't ever hold back a story from me again .

you're on bi prop .
this is a special presentation of msnbc news withjenny lerner .
good evening .
sometime in the next hour , the messiah mission will enter its most critical phase : the interception ofwolf biederman and the setting of the nuclear devices that will deflect it off its collision course with earth .
but fii rst , captain spurgeon tanner will have to guide the spacecraft through the blizzard of rocks , sand , and ice that make up the comet's tail , or coma .
the crew will have to complete its work before the sun rises .
sublimator looks good , mick .
disengaging auto now .
i'm eyeballs out from here on in .
how come that doesn't make me feel any better?
i heard that .
lights on .
cameras on .
on the mississippi river in mark twain's time , there were riverboat pilots who only knew a few miles ofthe river .
i mean , conditions changed so much , you couldn't know the whole trip .
floods , sandbars , fallen logs
it was all a riverboat pilot could do was to know his little piece ofthe puzzle .
so for the next few hours , this is my ship .
we start our approach .
jenny : ... are images from cameras mounted inside the cargo bay ofthe messiah .
now , these images are delayed by approximately 20 seconds , due to the distance they must travel .
ok , you can see that the image is breaking up a bit .
uh , houston is prepared for this .
they've informed us that due to the uncertain make up ofthe comet's coma , they're unsure whether or not transmission will be possible .
ok , now , now , it ap appears we're losing reception here .
ok , we've we've lost picture now .
but we will stay on the air .
we'll stay with you through all ofthis .
dap is in descent .
roger , descent .
oh , my god .
look at these .
they're the size of houses .
yeah , i know .
i see .
jesus christ .

ok .
start the clock .
jenny : lfall is going according to schedule , the astronauts should now be placing the moles on the comet surface .
the moles are , well , they're what they sound like .
they are drilling machines that burrow to a depth of 1 00 metres , where they wait to be detonated .
each one carries a 5, 000 kiloton warhead .
how's our time?
it's getting tight .
1 : 36 : 30 .
it's taking too long .
yup .
what happens if they do not get off the comet's surface in time?
the sun striking the comet will cause the temperature to rise 350 degrees in just a few minutes and activate the high speed gasjets .
well , ifthat happens , it will be like trying to work in a minefiield .
mark , what's your mole 4 readout?
mole 4 running true at 75 feet .
son ofa bitch .
what?
it's stuck .
try backing it up .
what's your depth?
75 feet .
is that enough?
no .
that'll just break pieces off the surface .
that's not deep enough .
yeah , fish , i know that's not deep enough .
i'm going in .
oren , no .
no , i'm gonna see if i can free it up .
stand by , tether attached .
all right , i gotcha .
oren , suit pressure , 3 . 5 .
come on , come on .
how's my time?
23 : 57 .
another 6 minutes , they won't have time to get back to us .
blow the tethers .
let's go get 'em .
ifwe go after them , we may not have enough fuel to get off the surface .
blow the goddam tethers .
mole 3 at depth .
we're heading your way , oren .
calculate exactly how much prop we need to get off this rock .
we'll shut it down when we hit it .
will do .
it opens up into a cave down here .
mole gotjammed against the side .
ok , fish , team 2 at location 4 .
give me your hand .
what the hell happened?
i don't know .
i don't know .
everything was going great , and we gotjammed up at 75 feet .
ok , hold up .
all right , try backing it up .
roger that .
that's it .
a little more .
shut it down .
no , they always put extra in these tanks .
fish , shut it down .
ok .
come on , you bastard !
come on !
time !
1 : 02 .
figured we'd better pick you kids up after school .
checkyour 6 , 1 00 yards .
i think we'd better hurry , boys .
all right , it's going !
it's going !
mole's at 1 25 feet .
the sun's rising behind you .
it's coming up fast .
face shields down !
oh , christ !
get the hell out ofthere !
aah !
oren , get your visor down .
get your visor down !
oh !
my eyes !
ohh !
all right , we got him .
oh , god !
my eyes !
oh , god , we're losing one .
he's got escape velocity .
1 , 000 feet and climbing .
aah !
mark , mikhail , get the hell out ofthere !
firing primary thrusters .
payload doors still open .
close 'em as we go .
houston , all moles are at depth .
nukes hot and ready .
we lost partenza to explosive outgassing .
and monash is injured .
we have to go get gus .
there's no time for that .
repressurize the cargo bay .
he's going to die out there !
we can still fii nd him .
he has a beacon .
i don't have time to argue with you .
just sit down and be quiet .
turn on the fuckin 'locator !
we've used most ofour propellant to get us out ofthe coma .
we can'tjust leave him .
we have to go back !
ifwe go back for gus , we all die .
we can'tjust leave him in space !
sit down , mick .
sit down .
it's ok .
the messiah has safely lifted off the comet .
but sadly , gus partenza has been lost .
gus partenza , a native of harrisburg , pennsylvania , and graduate of carnegie mellon university , joined the nasa space programme shortly after completing his medical training at duke university .
dr partenza was selected specifiically for this mission , not only for his medical expertise , but also for his dedication to the advancement ofspace technology .
yeah .
with the loss of dr gus partenza and with oren monash injured ,
captain spurgeon tanner is now in charge ofthe mission .
the messiah has successfully docked with the orion powered boosters and is now prepared to detonate the bombs planted on wolf biederman .
the messiah's exterior mounted camera will show us the detonation , but not before being temporarily blocked out by the nuclear blast .
once again , let me remind you , there is a 20 second delay , so when the picture comes back to us , the comet should already have been knocked off its present course .
prepare to remove safeties and fii re .
safeties removed .
weapons armed .
3 , 2 , 1 ...
now .
so now we'rejust waiting for the picture to come back .
decompression in area 6 .
mick !
i'll get the halon !
aah !
yes .
i'm still here .
we're live in 1 0 seconds .
cue the president .
mr president , 5 , 4 , 3 ...
hello , america .
it is my unhappy duty to report to you that the messiah has failed .
this computer enhanced radar image from houston shows how the detonation succeeded , however , did not destroy the comet .
there are now 2 pieces one 6 miles wide , the other , a mile and a half .
both are still on a path towards earth .
we've lost communication with the messiah spacecraft , although we continue to track it visually .
we don't know how many are alive .
we don't know their condition .
now , we have to make some decisions together .
what do we do?
you have a choice .
we have a choice ...
right now .
ever since the comet was discovered , we've been hoping and working for the best , but we've also been planning for the worst .
our strategy has been twofold .
first , our strategic missile command is preparing to coordinate with the russians a massive strike oftitan missiles to intercept the comets .
ifwe can deflect these comets enough , they will bounce harmlessly off our atmosphere and head on out into space .
unfortunately , the titans cannot be launched until the comets are only a few hours away .
and while we are confiident the missile attack will succeed , it is only prudent that we now take cautionary steps to ensure the continuation ofour way of life , to guarantee that there will be enough of us left to rebuild a new world in the unlikely event that the comets do strike the earth .
so , in the soft limestone of missouri , we've been preparing a network of immense caves , and they're almost fii nished .
and we can put a million people in them .
and that million people can survive there , underground , for 2 years , until the air clears and the dust settles .
now , the cave is more than a dormitory .
it's our new noah's ark .
we're storing seeds and seedlings , plants , animals , enough to start over .
on august 1 0th , a computer will randomly select 800, 000 americans tojoin the 200, 000 scientists , doctors , engineers , teachers , soldiers , and artists , who have already been chosen .
other countries are preparing similar caves along whatever lines they feel are best to preserve their way of life .
this is ours .
beginning tonight and continuing until the crisis passes ,
i am declaring a state of martial law .
the armed forces and the national guard are working with local law enforcement .
a national curfew begins at midnight tonight .
now , whereveryou are , go home .
stay off the roads after sunset .
crimes against persons or property will be dealt with swiftly and harshly .
news stations around the nation are being faxed copies ofthe lottery procedure as we speak , and they'll be broadcasting the details to you in a few moments .
i wish ...
no .
wishing is wrong .
it's the wrong word right now .
that's not what i mean .
what i mean is ...
i believe in god .
relax .
i know a lot ofyou don't , but i still want to offer a prayer ... for our survival .
mine included .
because i believe that god , whomeveryou hold that to be , hears all prayers , even ifsometimes the answer is no .
so , may the lord bless you .
may the lord keep you .
may the lord lift up his divine countenance upon you ... and give you peace .
and in 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 ...
we now have the details for the national lottery .
those ofyou who have been preselected will be notifiied within the next few minutes .
for the rest , on the night ofaugust 1 0th , those whose social security numbers have been randomly selected by computer will be notifiied .
while some americans ... over 50 years ofage have been preselected for the ark due to their expertise in a necessary fiield ofstudy , no men and women over 50 in the general population will be included in the lottery .
the ...
the evac the evacuation ofthose who have been selected for the ark will take no longer than 2 days , beginning on august 1 2th .
during this 2 day period , no unoffiicial travel will be permitted .
those selected will be taken by bus and train to the underground ark site by military personnel .
civil defence teams have been formed in every town with a population over 5, 000 .
they will distribute supplies and organize group shelters in underground parking facilities and other appropriate sites .
construction plans ...
equipment lists , and locations for securing the necessary provisions ...
hello?
yes , this is ellen biederman .
jenny : " ... on how to grow your own food underground and how to purify water are now available on the internet at www ...
we've been preselected .
jenny : " ... fcda . gov .
chuck?
chuck?
where are you going?
our phone .
they could be calling .
jenny : " ... beginning on august 9th .
the only phones that ring will be those ofthe people selected .
that's it .
that's all there is .
the interior camera circuitry is shot .
so , andy , can we get back into the cargo bay to reroute the video functions?
starboard cargo porthole's blown .
we could go in with the evas , but there's not much left in the life support packs .
we should be able to raise houston on the low band once we get closer .
and the orion is still functioning?
system check was ok , but i don't know about the radiation shielding .
so , ifwe fii re it up , we beat the comet back to earth , but we may end up glowing in the dark .
right?
ok , so , uh ...
anybody?
let's go home .
ok .
i have to say it's liberating knowing that i'm not going to be called .
i don't think i've ever been happier .
i've even stopped smoking .
what are you gonna do with all that extra money you save?
do you know the national gallery is saving all ofthe art?
they're shipping it to the caves .
i've given them my beautiful 1 8th century desk from new england and all the sheraton silver .
i really feel like i'd protected something when i gave them .
you should see my apartment .
there's nothing there .
it's practically japanese .
seems kind of unfair that i got picked .
you know , i'm not a doctor or a scientist .
people need continuity .
everyone knows you .
and they trust you .
but i ... can't help you .
don't worry about me .
i'm gonna be happy as long as i know you're going to live .
mr hotchner?
who did i think i was going to be when i bought that bike?
well , every kid on the block wants one now .
every parent on the block hates you for it .
that's the best news i've had in years .
um , sir?
could you give me a hand over here for a second?
yes , sir .
i just want to get these bars up .
hi , mrs hotchner .
a mob attacked and killed a miami rental yard operator who was charging $5, 000 an hour for backhoe and tractor rentals .
marines intervened to stop the violence .
mrs hotchner?
sarah's on the hill .
thankyou .
where were you today?
i've been looking all over foryou .
why weren't you at school?
my dad said i didn't have to go .
he said there's no point .
i talked to civil defence .
they said if you and i got married we'd be family , and i could get you in .
what about my parents?
they're not your family .
i don't want to go without my parents .
you don't have to .
i'm the famous leo biederman , and i haven't used my fame for anything , but i got them to let your family go , too .
you this is your only chance to survive .
across the country ,
iooters continue to set fii re to abandoned stores .
the fii res have been left to burn since many fii refii ghters have been called to help prepare shelters .
throughout latin america's major cities , business districts have been abandoned to looting gangs ...
airlifts have been ruled out as too dangerous .
more street fii ghting in moscow as food and fuel shortages continue .
believes all things , hopes all things , endures all things .
when i was a child , i spoke like a child ,
i thought like a child ,
i reasoned like a child .
when i became a man , i gave up childish ways .
for now we see in a mirror dimly , but then face to face .
now i know in part , then i shall understand fully , even as i have been fully understood .
do you , leo , take sarah to be your wife ... to have and to hold from this day forward ... for better , for worse ... for richer , for poorer ... to love and to cherish?
i now pronounce you husband and wife .
here , let me help you .
i'll get it .
yeah .
how you feeling?
all right .
i want to tell you something .
you children didn't bring any real books to read , did you know that?
i brought moby dick and huckleberry finn and baker and simon had never read them .
now , i'm afraid to askyou , have you ever read melville or twain?
hmm?
hey , i'm a child ofthe movies , fish .
ok , i see .
so ...
you got a shitty deal , oren , you know that?
you really did .
don't worry about me .
yeah .
i mean that .
really .
don't worry about me .
my whole life i ...
you know how it is for guys like us .
you you and i , we're the same .
what do you mean by that?
gotta be the best .
oh , i see .
be ... the best .
sometimes i see flashes of light ...
you know , like ... colours .
yeah .
i fall asleep ... and i dream .
but there's a part of me that's always awake .
and i can see myself dreaming .
i'm seeing things differently , fish .
well , that's good .
fish ... why the hell do they call you " fish "?
well , i ...
spurgeon , sturgeon , fiish .
took about 1 5 minutes of my fii rst day at the naval academy .
yeah .
your kids go there?
yeah , they did .
they did .
and they're good men , both ofthem .
i don't see as much ofthem as i used to when mary was alive .
you don't have to talk about it .
it's ok .
no , it's ok .
it's ok .
you're a married man .
you know what it's like .
every marriage has its good years and bad years .
we ended on a great year .
yeah .
anyway , let's get started .
moby dick .
chapter one .
call me lshmael .
several years ago , never mind how long precisely , having little or no money in my purse ... ... grim about the mouth ...
whenever it is a damp , drizzly november in my soul , whenever i fii nd myself ... ... knocking people's hats off , then i account it high time to get to sea as soon as i can .
listen up !

here .
look .
where's mom?
behind the camera .

mm hmm .
and this one , too .
she was such an artist , don't you think so?
you don't remember when we take them , hmm?
i'm 5 years old .
how would i remember that?
some people do remember when they were 5 years old .
it was such a beautiful day .
all alone on the beach .
and , ofcourse , she would have been in the picture , but there was no one else to hold the camera , and ... she insisted .
you know how she is .
how she was .
jenny .
it was such a good day for all of us .
don't you remember?
keep them .
goodbye .
we have now confii rmed the launch ofall the titan missiles from their positions in north dakota and wyoming .
the comets are now approximately 1 4 hours outside of earth's atmosphere , and we are told it should take these missiles
iess than 20 minutes to reach their target .
ok , here's what we're looking at .
all ofthe titans have been launched .
we still won't know if they've made a difference .
the comets have to travel for a while before the radar tracking stations can see ifthey've been pushed to a safe course that'll bypass the earth .
so , one more time we have to wait .
are we on?
we're on , mr president .
our missiles have failed .
the comets are still headed for earth ... and there's nothing we can do to stop them .
so , this is it .
ifthe world does go on ... it will not go on for everyone .
we have now been able to calculate the comets 'fii nal trajectories , and we have determined where they're going to strike .
the smaller ofthe 2 comets , biederman , will hit fii rst , somewhere along the atlantic seaboard probably in the waters off the coast of cape hatteras in just under 1 2 hours at 4 : 35 p . m . eastern daylight time .
the impact ofthe comet is going to be ...
well , disastrous .
there will be a very large tidal wave moving quickly through the atlantic ocean .
it will be 1 00 feet high , travelling at 1 , 1 00 miles an hour .
that's faster than the speed ofsound .
as it reaches shallow water , it's going to slow down , but the wave height , depending on the depth ofthe shelfoff the coast , will be anywhere from 1 , 000 to 3, 500 feet high .
where the land is flat , the wave will wash inland 600 to 700 miles .
the wave will hit our nation's capital 40 minutes after impact .
new york city , boston , atlanta , philadelphia ... all will be destroyed .
ifyou have any means of getting away from the path ofthis wave ,
ieave now .
the impact ofthe larger comet will be nothing less than an extinction level event .
it will strike land in western canada 3 hours after biederman .
within a week , the skies will be dark with dust from the impact and they will stay dark for 2 years .
all plant life will be dead within ... 4 weeks .
animal life within ... a few months .
so that's it .
good luck to us all .
could i bother everyone for a minute?
let's take a look at the big one .
now , the outgassing has created a vent a half mile wide and at least 2 miles deep .
comet gets closer to the sun , sun melts the ice , ice turns to steam , we get a big hole , ok?
so , how many nukes do we have left in the back?
4 .
ifwe can get the remaining bombs in that vent , there shouldn't be anything left bigger than a suitcase .
we can't do anything about the little one , but itjust might give them a chance .
without the arming codes , we're going to have to wait to set the bomb timers until we get closer to earth to raise houston .
we may not have enough life support left to get back into the cargo bay for the nukes , much less to go down to the comet .
we sure as hell don't have enough propellant left in the messiah to manoeuvre with .
how are we supposed to get back off the surface once we've gotten down there?
we don't .
well , look at the bright side .
we'll all have high schools named after us .
houston , this is messiah .
houston , this is messiah .
nice ofyou to call , messiah .
we were beginning to wonder what you were doing up there .
admiring the view , houston .
fish , is that you?
yep .
we don't have time to talk , houston .
there's nothing we can do about the smaller one , but we do have a plan .
we need the arming codes for the last 4 nukes .
arming codes?
what the hell for?
we can do or we can teach .
what's your pleasure?
get the arming codes !
get the goddam codes !
we have one helicopter .
holds 7 people .
we can ferry 6 people to high ground in west virginia and takejenny to the ark .
short stick goes .
i thought it was women and children fii rst .
ifyou get the short one , you can give up your seat .
thank god .
well , that makes sense .
i got a stick .
i got a stick .
i'm sorry , beth .
ok , honey , here we go .
let's go now .
beth ...
there's always the road .
we'll be ok .
come on .
ah , that's my girl .
ok , that's it .
sarah !
sarah !
where's that key?
where's the key?
come on !
hurry up !
come on !
no , wait .
what are you doing? !
we have to go now .
come on !
come on !
beth , what are you doing?
the road was so crowded .
we weren't gonna make it .
i thought ifthe wave comes , we should be here because she likes it here .
and we're on the 1 5th floor , so maybe we'll be ok .
say goodbye tojenny what are you doing? !

i once dropped you on your head .
when you came to the studio and brought those pictures ,
i lied when i said i didn't remember .
i remember everything .
i remember that we were right over there , and that's when mom got that picture ofthe house .
it was a perfect , happy day .
i came down here to let you know that .
thankyou .
i've missed you since then .
i missed you , too .
biederman .

well , mitch , uh ...
i want to say goodbye to mary .
i want to tell her i love her ... and that ever since we've been apart , every day , i think about her .

it's been a pleasure serving with you , commander .
the honour's all mine , andy .
be good , oren .
be good .
we watched as the bombs shattered the second comet into a million of pieces of ice and rock that burned harmlessly in our atmosphere and lit up the sky for an hour .
still , we were left with the devastation ofthe fii rst .
the waters reached as far inland as the ohio and tennessee valleys .
it washed away farms and towns ... forests and skyscrapers .
but the water receded .
the wave hit europe and africa , too .
millions were lost .
countless more left homeless .
but the waters receded .
cities fall ... but they are rebuilt .
and heroes die ... but they are remembered .
we honour them with every brick we lay ... with every fiield we sow ... with every child we comfort and then teach to rejoice in what we have been regiven .
our planet .
our home .
so now ...
iet us begin .
