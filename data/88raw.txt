dear mother .
i hope you are keeping well ... and not worrying too much about me .
you mustn't think that any of us are going to be killed ... for they are collecting such a force here ... that an attack would be insane .
the massachusetts men passed through here this morning .
how grand it is to meet the men from all the states , east and west ... ready to fight for their country ... as the old fellows did in the revolution .
but this time we must make it a whole country ... for all who live here , so that all can speak .
before this war began ... many of my regiment had never seen a negro .
now the roads are choked with the dispossessed .
we fight for men and women ... whose poetry is not yet written , but which will presently ... be as enviable and as renowned as any .
last night we heard of yet another defeat .
but we are not disheartened .
i am honored to be part of such a splendid company .
they have made me captain , of which i am enormously proud .
you would think it strange to see me giving orders to a hundred men ... most of whom are older than i am .
thank you for sending my volume of emerson .
his words come home to me like truth
'a deep man , 'he says , 'believes that the evil eye can wither ... that the heart's blessing can heal ... and that love can overcome all odds . '
my dearest love to father .
your son , robert .

he says lincoln is gonna issue an emancipation proclamation .
gonna free the slaves .
what?
maybe not in the border states ... but he will free some , anyway .
my god .
he said he would have done it sooner , only he was waiting tor a big victory ... which is , i guess , what this is .

still no word .
ritles?
see to it .
you're a big buck , aren't you?
you've got a lot to learn !
you haven't had a master like me !
dear mother .
the men learn very quickly .
faster than white troops , it seems to me .
they are almost grave and sedate under instruction ... and they restrain themselves .
but the moment they are dismissed from drill ... every tongue is relaxed and every ivory tooth is visible ... and you would not know from the sound of it that this is an army camp .
they must have learned this from long hours of meaningless , inhuman work ... to set their minds free so quickly .
it gives them great energy .
there is no doubt that we will leave this state ... as fine a regiment as any that has marched .
as ever , your son , robert .
they've done it .
assemble the men .
attention !
attention !
battalion !
ln accordance with president lincoln's wishes ... you men are advised ... that the confederate congress has issued a proclamation .
any negro taken in arms ... against the confederacy ... will immediately be returned to a state ot slavery .
any negro taken in federal unitorm ... will be summarily put to death .
any white otticer taken in command ot negro troops ... shall be deemed as inciting servile insurrection ... and shall likewise be put to death .
full discharges will be granted in the morning ... to all those who apply .
dismissed .
it you're not here in the morning ...
