5, 000 clams?
you borrowed 5, 000 clams from mr. sykes?
oscar , why do you get yourself into these situations?

it's ladies 'night , oh , what a night ...

oscar's dad's a tongue scrubber !
tongue scrubber !
tongue scrubber !
tongue scrubber !

my dad was the greatest .
but nobody loves a nobody .
i want to be a somebody .
oscar , you don't have to live at the top of the reef to be a somebody .
what's the difference?
if i don't pay mr. sykes back by tomorrow ...
i'm dead anyway , so ...
wait here .
what's this?
a pink pearl?
mm hm .
where'd you get that?
my grandmother gave it to me .
she said it started from a tiny grain of sand , but then , after a while , it grew into something beautiful .
dreams can begin small too .
no .
no , i couldn't ...
take it .
it'll get you the money you need for mr. sykes .
what do you mean , you don't understand?
we've been over it 1, 000 times .
i don't want to have to say it again .
you're really giving me agita .
i don't know how else to say this .
you see something , you kill it , you eat it .
period .
thanks .
that's what sharks do .
that's a fine tradition .
what's the matter with you?
your brother frankie , here , he's a killer .
thanks , pop .
he's beautiful .
he does what he's supposed to do .
wipe your face .

i need to know that you can handle that .
all right .
right here , in front of me now , eat this .
yeah .
gee , thanks , pop .
here's the thing .
i'm on a diet .
i read an article about these shrimps .
they're not good for ya .
you know how many calories are in one of those shrimps?
a lot .
it's true .
it's true and the other thing is , my sister had a baby and i took it over because she passed away and then the baby lost its legs and its arms and now it's nothing but a stump but i still take care of it with my wife and it's growing and it's fairly happy , but it's difficult 'cause i've been working a second shift at the factory to put food on the table , but all the love i see in that little guy's face makes it worth it in the end .
true story .
i'm not askin 'you anymore .
i'm tellin 'you .

have mercy .
pop , please ...

i'm tired of keeping it a secret .
and my dad , he'll never accept me for who i am .
what's wrong with me?
nothin 'is wrong with you , man .
i think all sharks should be like you .
god , that's sweet of you to say .
and stop blaming yourself for what happened .
really?
if you wanna blame anybody , blame me .
if i hadn't been there in the first place , none of this would've happened .

i do that by myself , you know .
it's just crazy .
it's too much , it's piling up ...
yeah , you know , one thing on top of the other .
actually , i was thinking about retiring .
you don't want to do that .
i don't?
you have worked your way to the top .
you don't want to go back to the bottom , do you?
no .

no way .
you just show 'em who's boss and those sharks will leave you alone .

everybody thinks you slayed the shark .
who am i to tell them they're wrong?
how could you lie to me?

i totally betrayed you , but listen , i got just one little problem i gotta take care of .
oh , what's that?
sharks are coming to get me !

oscar?
no , it's pinocchio .
of course it's me .
why did you do that?
i'm sorry .
no .
sorry " is when you step on somebody's fin at the movies .
sorry " is when you say , " when's the baby due?
and it turns out the person's just fat .
this is as far away from " sorry " as you could possibly get .
but , oscar , i think i'm gonna puke .
no , no .
lenny , just open up .
nice and easy .
are you not entertained?
you can't handle the truth .

why do you think she's interested , huh?
do you think for one minute that she'd even be with you if you weren't the famous sharkslayer?
please , don't fight .
are you blind?
she treats me like i'm somebody .
would she love you if you were nobody?
nobody loved me as a nobody .
i did .
before the money , and before the fame .
before the lie .
to me you were a somebody , oscar .

a sham .
a con .
you're a joke .

you mean that little bottom feeder from the whale wash?
forget about her .
she's a nobody .
no , i'm the nobody .
oh , let me guess .
she told you that she loves you .
is that it?
it's not like you feel the same way about her .

irie .
whale wash , where you ...
gimme it .
where you get a whale of a wash ...

how many times do i have to tell you?
it's " gosh .
you get a whale of a wash , and the price , oh , my gosh .

that's right , tough guy , we've got your girl .
there's a sit down in one hour .
who is it?
shh !
be there , if you don't wanna see her sleepin 'with the fishes .
the dead ones .
now , nod your head if you understand .
now , tell me if you nodded your head .
i nodded .
they got angie .
and they want a sit down .
i never meant for anybody to get hurt , especially not angie .
this is all my fault .
classic move .
i've seen it a thousand times .
they take the thing you love the most , and then they use it against you .
we gotta go to that sit down and we gotta save her .
whoa .
look , i wanna save angie , too , but i can't waltz in and say , " hi , pop .
i'm a dolphin .
lenny?
and the sharkslayer's a fake .
fake?
we're gonna need a better plan than that .
this is a joke , right?
because i told lino ...
shut up , lino .
shut up .
tell me that's not lenny .
tell me you're a real sharkslayer .
i'm sorry , sykes , i'm not .
but the sharks don't know that .
will you stop screwin 'around?
this'll never work .
we're dead .
thank you , sykes .
thank you .
my man sykes just begged me not to murder lise all y'all up in here .
now , i might listen to him , but then again i might not .
and that depends on the individual behavior of all the individuals in here , individually .
ain't that right?
look , he's got dolphin muscle .
my uncle vito got whacked by one of those .
now which one of you sardines called this meeting?
that would be me .
so , this is the sharkslayer .
i've been lookin 'forward to meeting you .
i feel like we're practically family .
you know that?
funny , ain't it?
i brought my kids into the world , full of love and care , and you took them out .
you know who i am?
do you know who i am?
i'm the don .
the boss of the great white sharks .
hey , boss , i saved you a seat .
i've been runnin 'this reef since before you was born .

he took out your flesh and blood , frankie .
but , pop , listen ...
but nothing .
you never take sides against the family .
ever .
hey , don .
lino .
sir .
it's not his fault .
this is between you and me .
