the red zone is for loading and unloading of passengers only .
there's no stopping in the white zone .
no .
the white zone is for loading and unloading .
there's no stopping in the red zone .
the red zone's always been for loading and unloading .
there's never stopping in a white zone .
don't tell me which zone's for stopping and which is for loading .
listen , betty , don't start up with your white zone shit again .
hello .
take this flower from the religious consciousness church .
would you like to make a donation?
no , thanks .
we gave at the office .
would you put all your metal objects into this dish , please?
there's just no stopping in a white zone .
really , vernon , why pretend?
we both know what you're talking about .
you want me to have an abortion .
it's the only sensible thing to do .
if it's done properly , therapeutically , there's no danger involved .
taxi !
i'll be back in a minute .
hello , sir , take this flower from the religious consciousness church .
would you care ...
hey , larry , where's the forklift?
forklift?
it's over there by the baggage loader .
look out !
elaine .
ted !
i came home early and found your note .
i guess you meant for me to read it later .
i've got to talk to you .
i don't want to go over it any more .
things haven't been right for a long time , but it'll be different , like in the beginning .
just be patient and i'll work things out .
i have been patient and i've tried to help , but you wouldn't even let me do that .
don't you feel anything for me any more?
it takes so many things to make love last .
most of all , it takes respect .
i can't live with a man i don't respect !
what a pisser .
captain oveur , white courtesy phone .
captain clarence oveur , white courtesy phone .
no , the white phone !
this is captain oveur .
one moment for your call from the mayo clinic .
captain oveur , white courtesy phone .
i've got it !
thank you .
go ahead with your call .
this is dr brody at the mayo clinic .
there's a passenger on your chicago flight , a little girl named lisa davis , en route to minneapolis .
she's scheduled for a heart transplant .
tell her mother we found a donor .
the heart is ready for surgery .
we must have the recipient on the operating table within six hours .
make sure she's kept in a reclined position , that a continuous watch is kept on her iv .
it's very important she remain calm ...
excuse me , this is the operator .
i have an emergency call on line five from mr hamm .
give me hamm on five , hold the mayo .
you'll be back tomorrow night .
we'll have dinner .
we'll talk things over .
i won't be back .
i've requested the atlanta run .
elaine ... l promise i can change .
then why didn't you take the job that louie netz offered you at boeing?
i haven't been able to get near a plane since the war .
and they wouldn't hire me because of my war record .
war record?
you're the only one keeping that alive .
for everyone else , it's ancient history .
you expect me to believe that?
it's the truth .
what's hurt you the most is your record since the war different cities , different jobs and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility .
elaine , just give me one more ...
it's too late , ted .
when i get back to chicago ,
i'm going to start my life all over again .
i'm sorry .
excuse me , take this flower from the church of religious ...
hi !
well , good evening .
there you go .
just follow them to the back .
any word on that storm lifting over salt lake , clarence?
no , not likely , victor .
i just reviewed the area report for 1600 hours through 2400 .
there's an occluded front stalled over the dakotas , backed up all the way to utah .
if she decides to push over the great lakes , it could get plenty soupy .
what about that southern route around tulsa?
i double checked the terminal forecast , and the wind's aloft and ifr ceilings all the way .
where do they top out?
light scattered cover at 20, 000 , icing around 18 .
looks like over denver is best .
denver it is .
sorry , clarence .
latest report shows everything's socked in from salt lake to lincoln .
hi , roger .
glad to have you aboard .
victor , this is roger murdock .
victor basta .
how do you do?
nice to meet you .
i was telling victor i reviewed the area report for 1600 hours through 2400 .
there's an occluded front stalled over the dakotas .
there you go .
thank you .
is elaine dickinson on this flight?
the whole flight crew has boarded .
let me see .
oh , yes .
she is on board .
i'd like one ticket to chicago .
no baggage .
smoking or non smoking?
smoking , please .
there .
have a nice trip .
striker , this is red leader four .
primary target covered by fog .
decision to proceed is yours .
the decision is yours ... is yours ... is yours ...
golly , that white fellow should stay away from my wife , or i will punch him .
yes , he is wrong for doing that .
i knew a man in a similar predicament , and he ended up being sorry .
don't be naive , arthur .
each of us faces a clear moral choice .
early to bed , early to rise makes a man healthy , wealthy and wise .
how true !
golly !
nervous?
yes .
first time?
no .
i've been nervous lots of times .
hi .
we'll be taking off real soon , so i better fasten you in tight .
thank you .
oh , mother , this is so exciting !
i know , but remember , you must get some rest .
that's good advice .
you relax , and i'll be back after takeoff .
thank you .
i'm going to miss you so much .
i'm going to miss you , too .
promise you'll write?
every day .
bill !
better get on board , son .
all aboard !

we're ready to taxi .
goodbye , bill !
goodbye , darling !
i love you , darling !
209er , taxi to runway 19er .
goodbye , darling !
have your picture taken the minute you get there and send me one .
ok .
here , hurry .
it's your watch .
you shouldn't .
you're going to need this .
it's all right .
it doesn't work .
bill !
goodbye , darling !
bill !
bill !
bill !
i'll keep it with me all the time .
goodbye , darling .

flight 209er clear for takeoff .
roger .

roger .

flight 209er , clear for vector 324 .
we have clearance , clarence .
roger , roger .
what's our vector , victor?
i want radio clearance .

that's clarence oveur .

roger .
huh?
roger .
over .
huh?
who?
do you feel all right , sir?
oh , i haven't flown for a long time .
good evening .
this is captain oveur speaking .
we'll be cruising at 36, 000 feet this evening ...
relax and enjoy your flight .
would you like something to read?
do you have anything light?
how about this leaflet , " famous jewish sports legends "?
yes .
thank you .
ted !
what are you doing here?
i've got to talk to you .
you shouldn't have come .
i don't have time now .
stewardess?
excuse me .
but ...
no wonder you're upset .
she's lovely .
and a darling figure .
supple , pouting breasts , firm thighs .
it's a shame you two don't get along .
yes , i know .
things used to be different .
i remember when we first met .
it was during the war .
i was in the air force , stationed in drambuie , off the barbary coast .
i used to hang out at the magumba bar .
it was a rough place .
the seediest dive on the wharf , populated with every reject and cut throat from bombay to calcutta .
it was worse than detroit .
the mood in the place was ugly .
you wouldn't be there unless you knew how to use your fists .
a fight broke out almost every night .
i didn't go there that night to fall in love .
i just wanted a couple of drinks .
and suddenly , there she was .
i was captivated , entranced .
it hit me like a thunderbolt .
i had to asked this guy to pinch me to make sure i wasn't dreaming .
i was afraid to approach her , but that night , fate was on my side .
we laughed , we talked , we danced .
i never wanted it to end .
i guess i still don't .
enough about me .
i hope this hasn't been boring for you .
whenever i talk about elaine , i get carried away .
i lose all track of time .
would you like to order dinner?
joey will have steak .
we'll have fish .
when can i see the cockpit?
the pilots are probably too busy flying the plane for that .
aw , gee whizz !
i'll talk to the captain and see what i can arrange .
gee , that'd be swell !
would you care to order your dinners?
i would like the steak , please .
i'll have the fish .
excuse me , i happened to be passing .
i thought you might like some coffee .
that's very nice of you .
thank you .
won't you sit down?
thank you .
cream?
no , i take it black .
like my men .
ted , i never knew i could be so happy .
these past few months have been wonderful .
tomorrow , why don't we drive to that little seafood place and ...
what's the matter?
my orders came through .
my squadron ships out tomorrow .
we're bombing the storage depots at daiquiri at 1800 hours .
we're coming in from the north , below their radar .
when will you be back?
i can't tell you that .
it's classified .
oh , ted , please be careful .
i worry about you so much .
i love you , elaine .
i love you .
flight 209er , this is denver flight control .
you're approaching rough weather .
please climb to 42, 000 feet .
roger , denver .
we have a visitor .
hello .
captain oveur , mr murdock , and mr basta , this is joey hammen .
hi , joey .
come up here .
this is for special visitors .
would you like to have it?
thank you .
thanks a lot .
sure .
ever been in a cockpit?
no , i've never been up in a plane before .
have you ever seen a grown man naked?
shall i check the weather?
no , why don't you take care of it?
joey , do you ever hang around a gymnasium?
we'd better get back .
no , joey can stay for a while .
could l?
ok , if you don't get in the way .
flight 209er to denver , climbing to cruise at 42, 000 .
will report again over lincoln .
over and out .
wait a minute , i know you .
you're kareem abdul jabbar .
you play basketball for the los angeles lakers .
sorry , you have me confused with someone else .
my name's roger murdock .
i'm the co pilot .
you are kareem !
i've seen you play .
my dad's got season tickets .
you should go back to your seat now .
right , clarence?
no , he's not bothering anyone .
let him stay here .
all right , but just remember my name is roger murdock .
i'm an airline pilot .
i think you're the greatest , but my dad says you don't work hard enough on defence .
and he says lots of times you don't even run downcourt .
and you don't try , except during play offs .
the hell i don't !
listen , kid , i've been hearing that crap ever since i was at ucla .
i'm out there busting my buns every night .
tell your old man to drag walton and lanier up and down the court for 48 minutes .
joey ...
do you like movies about gladiators?
elaine , just hear me out .
things haven't been right for a long time , but it'll be different , like in the beginning , remember?
i remember everything .
all i have is memories .
mostly , i remember the nights we were together .
i remember how you used to hold me , and how i used to sit on your face and wriggle , and ... afterwards , how we'd watch till the sun came up .
when it did , it was almost like ...
iike each new day was created only for us .
that's the way i've always wanted it to be .
but it won't be .
not as long as you insist on living in the past !
you're too low , ted !
you're too low !
the mind plays tricks on you .
he looks so happy today , doesn't he?
you look so happy today .
ok , robert , slip them down .
this won't hurt much .
you got a telegram from headquarters today .
headquarters?
what is it?
a big building where generals meet , but that's not important .
they've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid .
isn't that good news?
is it?
because of my mistake , six men didn't return from that raid .
seven .
lieutenant zip died this morning .
but dr sandler says you'll be out in a week .
isn't that wonderful?
i wish i could say the same for george zip .
be patient , ted .
nobody expects you to get over this immediately .
hey , striker , how about a break?
i'm getting tired .
yeah , all right .
take five .
thanks .
i found a wonderful apartment for us .
it has a brick fireplace and a cute bedroom with mirrors on the ceiling and ...
red leader !
red leader , i'm going down !
captain geline .
he think he's a pilot , still fighting the war .
i've found the tunnel , johnson !
it's this way ! $25 for a cigarette is too much !
what's his problem?
it's lieutenant hurwitz .
severe shell shock .
he thinks he's ethel merman .
war is hell .
excuse me , sir .
would you like coffee before dinner?
no .
no , thank you .
would you like another cup?
i will , but jim won't .
i think i will have another cup of coffee .
jim never has a second cup of coffee at home .
excuse me , sister .
yes?
there's a little girl onboard who's ill .
oh , yes , i saw .
poor child .
could i borrow your guitar?
i thought maybe i could cheer her up .
of course .
thank you .
hi .
hi .
do you mind if i talk to your daughter?
i think that'd would be nice .
hi , i'm randy .
i'm lisa .
oh , you have a guitar !
i thought maybe you'd like to hear a song .
i'd love to .
ok .
let's see ...
this is one of my favorites .
you're late .
we've been waiting .
who's first?
go ahead , clarence .
how's the weather?
we got some heavy stuff ahead .
we've got to climb on top .
yeah , after the war , i wanted to get as far away as possible , so elaine and i joined the peace corps .
we were assigned to an isolated tribe , the molombos .
they'd never seen americans before .
it was really a challenge , introducing them to our western culture .
at first , they didn't know what to think of us .
but soon , we gained their trust .
it'll help you better prepare storing foods for the up and coming monsoon months .
also , supperware products are ideal for storing leftovers to help stretch your food dollar .
this two quart " seals m rite " container keeps hot dog buns fresh for days .
these people had been completely isolated from civilization .
no one had outlined a physical fitness program for them , and they had no athletic equipment .
i started them on simple calisthenics , worked up to rudimentary game skills , and finally , advanced competitive theory .
i was patient , and they were eager to learn .
they seemed to enjoy themselves .
probably due to advanced american teaching techniques , we bridged the generations of isolation , and communicated successfully with the molombos .
they're getting the hang of it .
when we re enlist , i'll teach them baseball .
ted , i don't want to stay here .
it's time to go home to the plans we made before the war .
a lot of people made plans before the war .
like george zip .
at that moment , i realised elaine had doubts about our relationship .
and that , as much as anything else , led to my drinking problem .
we did come back to the states .
i tried a number of jobs .
i could go on , but i'd probably bore you .
i couldn't blame elaine .
she wanted a career .
i can't stand it .
what is it?
yes?
it's my stomach .
i haven't felt this awful since we saw that ronald reagan film .
i'll see if i can find some dramamine .
captain , a woman passenger is very sick .
airsick?
i think so , but i've never seen it so acute .
find out if a doctor's onboard as quietly as you can .
joey , have you ever been in a turkish prison?
i shouldn't have had that second cup of coffee .
jim never vomits at home .
sorry to wake you .
i'm looking for a doctor .
there's nothing to worry about .
stewardess , i think the man next to me is a doctor .
sir , excuse me .
sorry to wake you , are you a doctor?
that's right .
we have sick passengers .
could you come look at them?
yes .
yes , of course .
let me see your tongue .
i'll be back in a minute .
tell the captain to land .
she must go to a hospital .
a hospital !
what is it?
it's a big building with patients , but that's not important .
i must speak to the captain .
certainly .
victor , we're running into heavy ...
roger , take over !
captain , how soon can you land?
i can't tell .
you can tell me .
i'm a doctor .
no , i'm not sure .
can't you take a guess?
not for another two hours .
you can't take a guess for another two hours?
no , we can't land .
fog has closed down everything .
we've got to get through to chicago .
get him out of there !
what is it , doctor?
what's going on?
i'm not sure .
haven't seen anything like this since the anita bryant concert .
what did we have for dinner?
we had a choice steak or fish .
yes , i remember .
i had lasagna .
what did he have?
he had fish .
doctor , two more are sick .
the other passengers are worried .
we'll handle the passengers .
find out what the sick people had for dinner .
this is captain oveur speaking .
it's bumpy , but we'll be past it in a few minutes .
we're now flying over hoover dam , and later we'll pass south of the grand canyon .
meanwhile , relax and enjoy your flight , ok?
chicago , this is flight 209er .
we're in trouble .
we need traffic below us cleared and priority landing in chicago .
yes?
my husband's very sick .
can you do something?
the doctor will be with you in just a moment .
do you know what he had for dinner?
yes , we both had fish .
why?
it's nothing to be alarmed about .
we'll be back to you very quickly .
doctor , mr hammen ate fish , and randy said there are five more cases , and they all had fish .
the co pilot had fish .
what did the navigator have?
he had fish .
all right , now we know what we're up against .
those who had fish for dinner will soon become violently ill .
just how serious is it?
extremely serious .
it starts with a slight fever , dryness of the throat .
when the virus penetrates , the victim becomes dizzy , and begins to experience an itching rash .
from there , the poison works on the central nervous system , causing severe muscle spasms , followed by the inevitable drooling .
at this point , the digestive system collapses , accompanied by uncontrollable flatulence .
until , finally , the poor bastard is reduced to a quivering , wasted piece of jelly .
put it on ... automatic pilot .
automatic pilot , automatic pilot ...
there it is !
i'll go back to the passengers .
come in , 209er .
this is chicago .
flight 209er , come in .
this is elaine dickinson , the stewardess .
captain oveur's passed out .
we've lost the co pilot and navigator , too .
we're in trouble .
roger .
i'm steve mccroskey , chicago air control .
i'll be back in a moment .
hold all takeoffs .
when 508 reports , bring it straight in .
suspend all meal service on flights leaving los angeles .
tell all dispatchers to remain at the post .
how about coffee?
no , thanks .
i want the weather on every available landing field .
you understand?
any place available to land that plane !
go to the tower and get a runway diagram .
check down the field for emergency equipment .
chief , we got fog every place east of the rockies .
they'll have to come through to chicago .
looks like i picked the wrong week to quit smoking .
get the best available man who won't crack under pressure .
how about mr rogers?
get me rex kramer .
next to the throttle is the air speed gauge .
what speed does it indicate?
520 miles per hour .
good .
very good .
now , check your altitude .
that's the dial below and right of the speed indicator .
35, 000 feet .
no , wait .
34, 000 feet .
no .
it's dropping !
it's dropping fast !
why is it doing that?
oh , my god !
the automatic pilot , it's deflating !
elaine , don't panic .
on his belt line there's a hollow tube .
that's the manual inflation nozzle .
pull it out and blow on it .
what the hell's going on up there?
elaine .
yes , doctor?
elaine , you're a member of this crew .
can you face some unpleasant facts?
no .
unless we hospitalise those people quickly ,
i can't be sure of saving their lives .
is there anyone on board who can land this plane?
well ...
no .
no one i know of .
you ought to know our chances .
our lives depend on just one thing finding someone to fly this plane who didn't have fish for dinner .
ladies and gentlemen , this is your stewardess speaking .
we regret any inconvenience the sudden cabin movement caused .
this is due to periodic air pockets .
there's no reason to become alarmed .
we hope you enjoy your flight .
by the way , is there anyone on board who can fly a plane?
hello .
i'm paul carey from the airline .
i'm here to pick up captain kramer .
yes .
come in , paul .
rex will be right out .
shep , sit .
sit !
i understand there's an emergency .
something like that .
there wasn't time to tell me very much ...
shep , no !
i'll bet exciting things happen all the time down there .
airline business does have its moments .
after a while , you get used to it .
shep !
come !
he gets so excited when new people are here .
are you a pilot?
no , i'm in ... a training program .
it's unbelievable .
it's just unbelievable .
how many times have i warned about food inspection?
you'd think someone would listen to you .
well , airport management , the faa , and the airlines ... they're all cheats and liars .
all right .
let's get out of here .
i'm sorry , i was just looking for someone with flying experience .
when they built those roads , they didn't think about drainage , so we had to take a special jeep up to the main road .
we were lucky to get a jeep , since , just the day before , only one we had broke down .
it had a bad axle ...
excuse me , sir .
there's a problem in the cockpit .
the cockpit?
what is it?
the little room where the pilot sits .
that's not important .
the first officer is ill , and the captain needs someone to help him with the radio .
do you know anything about planes?
i flew in the war years ago .
i wouldn't know anything about it .
would you go up , please?
the stewardess said ...
both pilots?
can you fly this plane and land it?
surely , you can't be serious .
i am serious , and don't call me shirley .
doctor , i've checked everyone .
mr striker's the only one .
what's your flying experience?
i flew single engine fighters , but this plane has four engines .
it's an entirely different kind of flying ... altogether .
it's an entirely different kind of flying .
i haven't touched any kind of plane in six years .
mr striker , i know nothing about flying .
you're the only one on this plane who can possibly fly it .
you're the only chance we've got .
that's right .
that's what i said .
you heard me .
tell omaha to acknowledge and stand by .
every piece of emergency equipment available .
alert rescue units every mile of the way , from here to the rockies .
chief !
we'll need a free landing flight check .
fast .
it's your wife .
i want the kids in bed by nine , the dog fed , the yard watered , the gate locked .
get a note to the milkman " no more cheese .
where the hell is kramer?
no , he can't do that .
the risk of a flame out's too great .
keep him at 24, 000 ...
no , feet .
a passenger is going to land that plane .
is that possible?
it's a hundred to one shot .
i know this guy .
you do?
who is it?
ted striker .
i flew with him during the war .
it won't make my job easier .
ted striker was a crack flight leader .
he was one of those men who ... felt too much inside .
maybe you know that kind .
he went all to pieces on a particular mission .
let's just hope that doesn't happen tonight .
let's see ...
altitude , 24, 000 feet .
level flight .
speed , 520 knots .
course zero niner zero .
trim , mixture .
wash , soap , rinse , spin .
ted !
what are you doing here?
you can't fly this plane !
that's what i'm trying to tell them .
elaine .
i don't have time to be gentle , so i'll be very direct .
everyone is in a desperate situation .
mr striker is the only hope we got .
those are the flaps .
this is the thrust .
this must turn on the landing lights .
mayday !
mayday !
mayday?
what the hell is that?
may day's the russian new year .
we'll have a big parade and serve ...
i can't stand it any more .
i've got to get out of here !
calm down !
get a hold of yourself !
please let me handle this .
i've got to get out ...
calm down .
get to your seat .
i'll handle it .
calm down .
get ahold of yourself .
doctor , you're wanted on the phone .
everything will be all right .
sister , i can handle this .
got to get out of here !
we'd like you to have this flower .
excuse me , sir , would you ...
donations for reverend moon?
jews for jesus?
read about jehovah's witness?
how about buddhism?
help jerry's kids?
scientology?
for nuclear power?
your attention , please .
no frills passengers now arriving .
please have your baggage claim checks ready to show upon leaving the terminal .
this guy has no airline experience .
he's a menace to everything in the air .
yes , birds , too .
ok , he's a terrible risk , but what other choice have we got?
that's the whole story , rex .
everything we know .
let's face a few facts .
i flew with striker during the war .
he can't afford to worry about those times when ... things weren't so good .
right now things aren't so good .
let me tell you something .
striker was a top notch squadron leader long ago .
get on the horn and talk that guy down .
let him get the feel of that airplane , then you'll have to talk him right down to the ground .
very well .
put striker on the speaker .
use my radio .
i took the wrong week to quit drinking .
you can work them direct from here , captain .
striker?
striker , this is captain rex kramer speaking .
yes , captain kramer .
read you loud and clear .
all right .
it's obvious you remember me .
what do you say we forget about everything , except what we must do?
let's not kid each other , kramer .
you know i've never flown a bucket like this .
i'll need all the luck there is .
stand by , striker .
our one hope is to build this man up .
i've got to give him confidence .
striker , you ever flown a multi engine plane?
no , never .
shit !
it's a goddamn waste of time .
there's no way he can land it !
you got to talk him down !
you got to !
route him into lake michigan .
at least avoid killing innocent people .
you're the only chance they've got .
all right .
striker , you listen , and you listen close .
flying a plane is like riding a bicycle .
it's just harder to put baseball cards in the spokes .
first , get the feel of the plane .
later , we'll run down the landing procedure .
all right .
disengage the automatic pilot .
make no violent control movements like you did in the fighter planes .
all right .
i'll unlock the automatic pilot .
the controls will feel very heavy compared to a fighter .
don't worry about that .
it's perfectly normal .
now , one more thing .
can somebody work the radio and leave you free for flying?
the stewardess is here with me .
good .
have her sit in the co pilot seat .
elaine , he wants you to sit in the co pilot seat .
what's going on?
we have a right to know the truth .
all right , i'll level with you all .
the most important thing is that you remain calm .
there's no reason to panic .
it's true one of the crew members is ill .
slightly ill .
the other two pilots are fine .
they're flying the plane , free to pursue a life of religious fulfilment .
the radio is all yours .
keep an eye on number three engine gauge .
it's running a little hot .
striker , first i'd like to say something .
i know things must look pretty rough up there .
if you do what i tell you when i tell you , there's no reason you should lack confidence in your chances of coming out alive and in one piece .
what weather are you in?
rain .
and a little ice .
and a little ice .
how's it handling?
sluggish .
like a wet sponge .
sluggish .
like a wet sponge .
all right , striker .
you're doing just fine .
it's damn good he doesn't know i hate his guts .
it's damn good you don't know he hates your guts .
can i get you something?
i'm sorry .
i don't understand .
stewardess .
i speak jive .
good .
he said he's in great pain , and he wants to know if you can help him?
tell him to relax .
i'll be back with some medicine .
call captain oveur's wife and let her know what's going on .
this weather bulletin just came off the wire .
what can you make out of this?
this?
i can make a hat or a brooch or pterodactyl ...
hello?
mrs oveur?
yes , this is mrs oveur .
this is ed macias calling from the airport .
there's trouble on your husband's flight .
we don't know how serious it is , but steve mccroskey thought you'd want to come over right away .
yes .
i'll be right down .
i've got to go to the airport .
you can let yourself out the back door .
there's juice in the refrigerator .
doctor says the sick people are getting worse .
we're running out of time .
i've got to concentrate .
i've got to concentrate .

jack , i'm so hot , i'm burning up .
i'll turn on some air .
what's going on?
close the window !
chicago , the passengers are panicking .
when do we start down?
not yet .
you'll be in radar range any second now .
they should have been in range 10 minutes ago .
gunderson , check the radar range .
anything yet?
about two more minutes , chief .
two minutes?
they could be miles off course .
impossible !
they're on instruments .
this is going to be a real sweat .
gunderson , let me know when you get anything .
got a cigarette , nels?
i can't take much more of this .
looks like i picked the wrong week to quit amphetamines .
johnny , how about some more coffee?
no , thanks .
these reporters want a statement .
how much longer can they hold out?
30 , 45 minutes .
who's flying the plane?
a passenger .
he's an experienced air force pilot .
no cause for alarm .
take over .
what kind of plane?
it's a big , pretty white plane with red stripes , curtains and wheels .
it looks like a big tylenol .
ok , boys .
let's get some pictures .
this bulletin just handed to me .
stricken airliner approaching chicago ...
shana , they bought their tickets .
they knew what they were getting into .
i say , let them crash !
would you like some whisky , ma'am?
certainly not !
how are the passengers?
i won't deceive you , mr striker .
we're running out of time .
surely , there's something you can do .
i'm doing everything i can ... and stop calling me shirley .
randy , are you all right?
oh , dr rumack .
i'm scared .
i've never been so scared ...
and besides , i'm 26 and i'm not married .
we're going to make it .
you've got to believe that .
dr rumack , do you have any idea when we'll be landing?
pretty soon .
how are you bearing up?
to be honest , i've never been so scared , but at least i have a husband .
stay in formation .
target's just ahead .
target should be clear if you go in low enough .
you'll have to decide .
you'll have to decide .
you'll have to decide .
stay in formation .
target's just ahead .
target should be clear if you go in low enough .
you'll have to decide .
you'll have to decide .
you'll have to decide .
oh , rats !
lost number four .
what happened?
what went wrong?
i forgot to check the oil pressure .
when kramer hears about this , the shit's going to hit the fan .
i told him to watch that oil temperature .
what's he doing?
stiker , that plane can't land itself .
ease off .
it's not his fault .
it could happen to any pilot .
it happened to barbara stanwyck .
can't push him too hard .
might break .
remember who you're dealing with .
nick , pete , jerry , there's a fire in the barn .
he's right .
i can't take the pressure .
i was crazy to think i could land this plane .
but , ted , you're the only ...
i don't care .
i don't have what it takes .
they would be better off with someone who's never flown before .
bad news .
fog's getting thicker .
and leon's getting larger .
i know what you're going to say , so save your breath .
well , i don't have a thing to say .
you've done the best you could .
you really have .
the best you could .
we can't expect to win them all .
i want to tell you something i've kept to myself through these years .
i was in the war .
medical corps .
one night , they brought in a badly wounded pilot from one raid .
he could barely talk .
he looked up at me , he said ,
the odds were against us there , but we went in anyway .
i'm glad .
captain made the right decision .
the pilot's name was george zip .
george zip said that?
the last thing he said to me ,
doc , " he said , " sometime ...
.. the crew is up against it .
the breaks are beating the boys .
tell them to give it all they've got
and win just one for the zipper .
i don't know where i'll be then , " he said ...
but i won't smell too good , that's for sure .
excuse me , doc .
i've got a plane to land .
you'd better stay up there a bit .
when the fog lifts , we'll bring you in .
i'll take it , elaine .
listen , dr rumack says the sick people are in critical condition .
every minute counts .
we've got to land now .
don't be a fool , striker .
you know what landing like this means .
i'm ordering you to stay up there .
no dice , chicago .
i'm giving the orders , and we're coming in .
i guess the foot's on the other hand now .
he'll never make it in this soup .
but it's his ship now .
he's in charge .
he's boss , head man , top dog , big cheese , head honcho ...
captain , look at this .
passengers certain to die .
airline negligent .
there's a sale at penny's !
i'll need three men in the tower .
you , neubauer , you , macias .

big tree .
striker , we're going to the tower .
good luck .
they're going to the tower .
the tower !
the tower !
rapunzel !
rapunzel !
stewardess , how soon till we land?
it won't be long now .
try not to worry .
we're all ready , sir .
captain mccroskey , this is captain roberts .
captain kramer , this is captain colosimo .
captain hinshaw , this is captain gantz .
captain kramer , captain gantz .
captain hinshaw , captain roberts .
colosimo , you work the relay .
roberts , check air traffic .
get that finger out of your ear .
you don't know where it's been .
steve !
got a cigarette , nels?
linda , your husband and the others are alive but unconscious .
just like gerald ford .
there's a chance we can save them if striker lands that plane in time .
that isn't much of a chance .
i don't know .
we're doing everything we can .
now excuse me .
where did you get that dress?
it's awful !
and those shoes and that coat !
geez !
8 miles .
turn right to heading 044 .
we're now at 2, 000 feet beginning our descent .
pour every light onto that field .
it's being done .

airport vehicles , take positions one and two .
civilian equipment , number three .
air force , positions four and five .

life jackets are under your seat .

when i give the word , pull the cord on the right side flap .
your seat cushions are also equipped with a flotation device .
wzaz in chicago , where disco lives forever .
your altitude's too erratic .
you can't come straight in .
you've got enough fuel for two hours .
i'll take it , elaine .
listen to me , kramer .
we have people up here who will die in less than an hour .
i may bend your precious airplane , but i'll get it down .
the passengers are ready .
thanks , randy .
you better leave , sweetheart .
you might get hurt up here .
ted ...
yes?
i wanted you to know ... now ...
i'm very proud .
tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land .
the gear is down , and we're ready to land .
he's on final now .
put out all runway lights except niner .
captain , maybe we ought to turn on the searchlights .
no .
that's just what they'll be expecting us to do .
i want to tell you both good luck .
we're all counting on you .
now listen carefully .
you'll see the runway at 300 feet .
touch down a third of the way .
a slight cross wind , so be ready .
land too fast , use your emergency brakes .
red handle's right in front .
if that doesn't stop you ...
if that doesn't stop you , cut the four ignition switches .
can you see us now?
you should be able to see the field .
sure is quiet out there .
yeah , too quiet .
looks like i picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue .
there it is .
there he is !
striker , you're coming in too fast .
i know , i know !
he knows , he knows !
below 700 now .
still going down .
675 , 650 , 625 , he's holding .
no , he's down , he's down .
sound your alarm now .

remember your brakes and switches .
get ready to flare it out !
he's all over the place .
900 up to 1 , 300 feet .

striker , lift your nose .
straighten your wings .
coming in too fast .
watch your speed .
he's coming right at us !
coming in too hot .
ease up on the throttle .
watch out for that cross wind .
level it out .
you'll have to dip your left wing .
you're drifting .
keep your eyes on the far end of the runway .
you're too low , damn it !
watch your stall speed .

striker , are you all right?

but some of us , particularly me , would like to buy you a drink and shake your hand .
and , ted , when the going got rough ...
have a nice day .
ok .
have a nice day and thank you for flying transamerican .
loneliness , that's the bottom line .
i was never happy as a child .

of course not .
it never happens .
