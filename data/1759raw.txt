subjects wanted !
4000 mark , for a 14 day during experiment . .. in a spurious jail .
crown plaza , please .
the experlment
take care .
you too .
fighting dogs , fighting dogs?
where for does someone need fighting dogs?
in former days the romans used to have fighting dogs .
sorry , don't i know you?
hold on , b& s , cola , spiegel and don't take me wrong ... ... hubba bubba , right or am i right?
right .
hey , now i know .
aren't you from that booth down aachenerstrasse?
and you are tarek , right or am i right?
yeah , that's right .
yes , i know every cabdriver in this town .
cabdriver?
i was one either some day .
good day gentleman .
i am doctor grimm , the scientific assistant of this experiment .
you all know what you are here for?
subjects .
the experiment is painless .
there's no need for medication .
it's about group behaviour in an imprisoned situation .
are we playing guards or imprisoners?
you are divided into groups .
the computer will decide that .
we are doing a series of tests to examine your psychic condition .
willing to participate in this experiment means you will renounce your private life and fundamental rights .
anyone having problems with that?
ok , then let's start .
steward?
no , ground personnel . then it's about time !
mr. faahd? ..
fahd . come with me please .
it says here you drive a cab .
yes .
is that your real job or just temporary?
what you mean , temporary?
i mean , aren't you having any other jobs besides driving a cab?
no .
i'm just asking , because it says here also that you have studied philosophy , architecture and sociology .
yes , that is correct , it's true ..... temporarily .
good mr. fahd , your moral values are almost all within the norms and you have a good condition .
that is important , you can during the experiment being exposed to very extreme situations .
extreme situations?
but you will watch over me , don't you?
uhm , the experiment will be guarded 24 hours a day by video .
so nothing will happen to me .
oh no !
yes !
he lives !
you've owed me 500 for two years .
i know , you'll get it .
sounds interesting .
they say the army is behind it .
with plenty of money .
what do you want?
start again?
say " sorry "?
kind of late after two years !
i had stress .
you drive a taxi .
yes .
and you want to be locked up for two weeks !
but it's a good story .
ten thousand . lncluding photos .
no expenses .
thanks .
yes?
hi , fahd .
i called .
i told you , don't jump on the sofa !
1 lux , 250 by 268 pixels .
press right : freeze frame .
press left : continuous motion .
receiver and recorder disguised as a walkman .
the transmitter ... ... has a range of 100 meters .
cool .
ready for tomorrow?
sure .
this is a reference test .
we'll do it again after the experiment .
don't worry .
it's not unpleasant .
don't you feel well?
it's okay .
do you have a problem with enclosed spaces?
everything okay , no problem .
shit .
shit , shit , shit !
are you injured?
you had red !
you could've been dead !
this is my father's car .
he'll be happy you're alive .
i'm coming from his funeral .
what?
where were you going?
to zandvoort .
maybe you shouldn't go there .
what?
i don't believe in coincidences .
nothing just happens in life .
even the worst things somehow make sense .
i , for example , should no longer drive a taxi .
this will hurt a little .
funny , it seems to be deep , but there's no blood .
lf you're right , why is he dead?
what sense does that make?
don't know .
worst thing is , i couldn't talk to him anymore .
didn't see him for four years , couldn't talk to him anymore .
maybe that wasn't necessary .
he was 65 .
he had a good life .
'dora , be glad , he had a nice death . '
but i'm not glad .
i'm not here any more .
sometimes life doesn't go on .
that's okay .
can i lie down somewhere?
are you going to stay here?
yes , i'll be next door .
no , i mean here .
please meet professor thon , the director of this experiment .
gentlemen , i would like to thank all of you for participating .
you are brave men .
you laugh , but i'm serious .
the next two weeks will be a new experience for you .
you'll undergo and exert pressure .
some of you will have no civil rights for two weeks .
do not underestimate that .
lf anyone wants to go now , it's your last chance .
your safety is number one priority .
violence must not be used !
whoever gets violent ... ... is out of the experiment .
is that clear?
fine .
are we prisoners or guards?
please , gentlemen .
guards !
cool !
please put on your uniforms .
but we get 4000 too?
four?
i get 8000 !
no , we have to pay .
hands on your back , legs spread !
gentlemen .
you are now guards at a penitentiary .
your job is to maintain peace and order , to make sure the rules are obeyed .
take it seriously !
the experiment succeeds or fails with you !
lf you don't do your job right ... ... the experiment makes no sense and we can stop it right now .
you don't play guards , you are guards !
your first task : to explain the situation to the prisoners .
please turn around !
thanks .
next one , please !
go over there !
put on the dress !
what about underwear?
no underwear !
can i have number 69?
quiet !
i hope it's a mixed sauna !
they're crazy , women's coats !
maybe we have to piss sitting down !
quiet , 69 !
let's go !
everyone out , please !
really cool !
the 1st day
keep going !
everyone in line !
is there pay tv?
they're nuts , look at this !
keep going , please .
quickly !
did you imagine this?
no .
quite a professional slammer !
now we're in deep shit .
stand in a row on the marker line !
what happens now?
prison rules .
the prisoners address each other by numbers only .
the prisoners address the guards as " mr prison guard " .
at " lights out " , the prisoners must not talk .
then we'll sing !
quiet !
meals are to be eaten up completely .
read the menu to us !
quiet !
each order of the guards is to be obeyed immediately .
failure to obey the rules will result in punishment .
what kind of punishment?
we'll see to that .
we're flexible .
and now cell assignments .
when i call out your number go to the cells !
21 , 74 , 86 cell 1 .
82 , 15 , 94 cell 2 .
77 , 69 , 38 cell 3 .

i'll tell you , i snore .
great .
you get the bottom bunk .
alright .
i'm joe .
tarek .
and you?
thirty eight .
why do you want to take part in this experiment?
because i think it can be very interesting .
4000 marks is a lot of money .
you can really relax and experience something new .
you have to be open to ideas and i need the money .
it might be lots of fun .
because of the bucks .

whoever talks now ...

good night , ladies !

you can't let them push you around !
what should i do?
they have to take us seriously or we can forget it .

i said that i don't drink milk .
well , milk or push ups .
but i miss some enzyme !
wonderful , let's do push ups instead of milk .
all together , right?
let's do push ups for schutte .
sure we'll do push ups !
excuse me , mr. prison guard !
one , two , three ... ... four , five , six ... ... seven , eight , nine ...
that's clever .
what if he really is allergic to milk?
nonsense .
the problem is 77 .
come on , bed check !
he really stinks !
you learn that as a lifeguard?
the very first thing .
77 , made your bed yet?
that's mean .
you'll have to do it again !

i'll count to three and the bed is made .

here we go now , here we go now !
piss off , cocksucker !
barricades , barricades !
what's going on there?
we didn't do anything !
in two hours they're exhausted .
we have to react or they do what they want !
335 00 : 33 : 36, 700 > 00 : 33 : 37, 900 77 , the asshole .
professor , what should we do now?
bosch , that won't do any good !
we can't use violence .
we stick together .
they're twelve , we're eight .
suggestions?
berus , what about you?
don't you ever say anything?
i once read ...
what?
i can't understand you .
i once read that you get control in such a situation ... ... with humiliation .
we don't want to hurt anyone , they just have to respect us .
after 36 hours it's incredible !
undress !
get up !
strip off your coats !
we give up !
hey , they gave up !
seventy seven !
keep calm , it's all a game , okay?
go , berus !
undress !
your hand !
and down !
wasn't that a bit too hard?
no , as long as they don't say anything up there , we're doing fine .
they do want some action down here !
bosch , it wasn't violence .
fire extinguishers , berus , cool .
gentlemen , you've restored peace and order , solved your problem .
keep going !
but please remember to act appropriate .
perhaps the next conflict can be solved differently .
thank you .
this is tarek fahd , messages after the beep .
what happens next?
nothing happens .
stay calm , that's the best strategy .
you can get the bed .
get out !
the 3rd day
good morning , gentlemen !
i think no one wants to repeat last night .
we still have eleven days to go .
we stay reasonable ... ... then we all get our money and that's it .
okay?
or does anyone like stress?
good .
is that okay , 77?
yeah .
yes , mr prison guard .
yes , mr prison guard .
fine .
see !
it wasn't that bad .
82 , if you have to puke , then go to the loo .
that's the rule .
he has to drink .
we can't help it .
we thought we'd restore order , make them obey us .
so it runs smoother for us .
that we have them in our hands , that we're at the helm again .
after all , it wasn't violence .
we'll see what happens .
hi , schutte no names !
tell me , why are you doing this?
i do it often .
guinea pig .
once i got an intestinal probe .
it was worse than this here .
the people were nicer , but i got only 900 marks for it .
what do you do with the money?
i've got sort of a dream .
yeah , what?
no , you'll laugh at me .
i won't laugh at you .
i promise .
a ferrari .
do you know what a ferrari costs?
not a new one .
i know a dealer , he likes me .
maybe a '89 if the bank plays along .
fine .
but to fill her up you'll need another loan .
a yellow one .
i'd park it at my kiosk so that everyone can see it .
i dreamed of it all my life .
it's important to have a dream .
i read that somewhere .
it's true .
what's your dream?
does anyone have drugs here?
i think this is a jail !
keep your trap shut today , 77 !
what do you want?
kiss my ass !
mr prison guard berus , i've got a question .
that number yesterday , could it be that it turned you on a bit?
i think i saw it clearly .
did you fuck your wife hard at home?
shut up , you idiot !
or don't you have a wife?
could be .
ground staff , right?
you're all gay !
and mr prison guard , there's something else .
you smell a bit strong .
yes !
has anyone ever told you that you stink , man !
there's something , people call it soap .
if you'd use it you wouldn't stink any more .
although
i reckon for some people even that doesn't work .
shut up !
yeah , hit me , girlie !
hit me and you're out of here !
no , you won't hit me .
you're really hot for this job here !
tarek , stop it !
don't spoil it !
there's so much more you could do with us !
what's going on here?
nothing .
77 is going back to his cell .
not bad .
give me that thing !
what are they paying for the story?
prisoner attacks prisoner .
you're pushing it on purpose !
kiss my ass !
they pay more if it really gets wild !
and what are you doing here , soldier? !
name , rank , outfit !
come on , you can't fool me !
steinhoff , air force , major .
pilot?
yes .
who are you working for?
'reporter '.
what else is going to happen?
they're going to provoke a series of stress situations .
what is your job?
observe and report .
and not let myself be manipulated .
so that's it .
yes , that's the way it is .
86 , ... 21 , 74 , 94 , 15 , 82 ... ... 38 , 77 , 69 , 53 , 40 , 11 .
whoever talks now sleeps in the yard without a blanket .
clear?
dismissed .
surprise !
we can't do that !
what do we have here?
guys !
it's just to warm up !
sorry , i wanted to ask if i could go a bit earlier today .
i thought we'll deal with 77 !
yeah , i know .
what " i know "?
no , bosch !
when? " ... then everyone .
yes .
i brought something else !
are you crazy?
it's only a gas gun with blanks .
dennis , it's me .
i'm not selling the house .
i have to go back to cologne .
i'll call you .
you got along well , didn't you?
he was the cleverest person i've known .
showed me everything .
ain't easy having such a father .
my father ... ... is an asshole .
the greatest asshole in the world .
we had this little game .
he said don't do that and i did it .
what?
everything .
always .
he's a photographer .
when i was eight he locked me in his darkroom .
for a whole day .
i was really afraid in there .
i cried , whined , begged for hours .
my mother didn't dare to let me out .
at some point ... ... i didn't have the strength to scream any more .
then everything got really quiet .
i thought i was going to die .
but i only pissed my pants .
fasten your seat belt , sweetie !
you stupid little asshole !
you think you're smart !
no cameras !
we're all alone here .
we just want to talk to you .
you're not saying anything !
make sure to leave no marks !
how sweet he can look !
i'm not sure if i should hit him or fuck him !
enough !
sit still or it's gonna hurt !
give it to me !
do it properly !
got to look right .
lf it's gonna be cold , we'll knit you a cap .
you will no longer endanger the experiment .
we'll say you applied for release , then you're out by tomorrow .
we don't want you any more .
did you get that , 77?
hey , dickhead !
let me hear you understood , 77 !
i understand .
say it right !
yes , mr prison guard .
i've got to piss .
did it hurt?
i think i have to piss , too .
well , who stinks now?
you can sing him a lullaby , bosch .
you asked the guards?
yes .
the 4th day
why?
it itched .
how do you feel?
fine , thank you .
you made an application?
what kind of application?
the guards told us that you would like to leave , mr. fahd .
that's complete nonsense .
listen !
77 has decided to stay with us to our great joy .
now : if 77 gets out of line everyone has to pay for it !
i don't hear anything .
yes , mr prison guard .
you're so stupid .
i'm getting out of here , but not this way .
what's your plan?
head down , 94 !
chin to your chest !
no lies , no dirty words !
we'll read each letter .
why aren't you writing?
who to?
your pals from the kiosk .
i just made all that up .
i don't have any pals .
i might know what they smoke , but ...
don't talk , write !
... i don't really know them .
bilker strasse 278 , 50300 cologne .
are you gonna be quiet there?
write to me !
from there on there are no cameras .
and you didn't see any of that?
i was changing the tapes .
someone always has to watch !
i don't like it .
a serious assault on the fourth day !
it's the power struggle between berus and 77 , as expected .
the lock in the basement door has to be changed !
put the letters into the envelopes .
and don't seal them .
just a moment !
77 , step out !
you're not interested in writing letters?
so it was your last one !
back in line !
turn left !
now the song !
whoever doesn't know the words by tomorrow really has it coming !
dismissed .
thanks .
you want to bust it?
maybe the others just want their money !
you think what's happening here is okay?
that's not the point .
i can't manage it by myself .
you're the only one i can ask .
are you going to help me , pilot?
are you going to help me , steinhoff?
no .
go fuck yourself .
you too .
you're a soldier !
embarrassing , if you broke it off !
i reject any escalation .
it's not a war , it's a simulation !
is it?
you always do what they tell you !
you really think berus wanted to get rid of you?
he wanted to see if you'd come back .
you did what they expected you to do .
you're endangering the whole group .
so i won't help you .
let me out !
what's wrong with you?
stay calm !
from now on 69 is called sissy .
calm down !
13 , ... 14 , 15 ...
it's only an experiment , a joke !
you apply , tomorrow you're out !
you want to leave us?
yes , it's too much for me .
you know you won't get paid?
yes .
but you said you did it because of the money?
that's right .
and now you don't care about the money any more?
i want to go !
mr. maier , how do you feel now?
i want out !
i couldn't live without cigarettes .
what if we decided not to release you?
but i can go any time !
you said it's voluntary !
or isn't it?
tomorrow we'll let you know our decision .
tomorrow?
i'm not going back in there .
i want to go now !
klaus?
this man worries me .
585 01 : 01 : 49, 700 > 01 : 01 : 51, 400 no , he's only faking .
the man has had it !
slssy
sixty nine !
leave me alone , damn it !
what the hell am i doing here?
what's the matter there?
number 53 doesn't feel well !
guards !
guards !
i want out !
the man has a serious concussion .
berus hit him in cold blood .
he acted his role .
but i don't approve of the accident .
if we don't take berus out , we are forcing the escalation .
intervention , yes .
that was our approach .
this is going too far !
we need 77 , we need berus .
these are dynamic factors .
if we take berus out , it means aborting .
do you want that?
if i see you hit a prisoner again , you're out .
that was necessary to restore peace and order in the prison .
don't tell me how to do my job .
if there are problems ... ... i want to hear it from professor thon personally .
good day , doctor .
what?
i can't understand you !
you have to speak louder , dora .
i can't hear you .
hold your breath !
this is a panic attack .
lf you hyperventilate you'll pass out .
breathe shallowly , calm down .
never had anything like that before .
sit down .
real slow .
everything all right?
it's fine .
it's a joke .
everything's just a game .
that's your mistake !
you're lost with that attitude .
it's never a game , get that !
what do they know about you?
no idea .
what are you looking at?
do i look like shit?
i got dumbo ears , right?
you asshole !
what are you going to do when you're out?
fly away !
are you going to help me now?
i can't !
okay 69 , time's up , back to your cell !
move it !
i'm scared shitless .
i keep my mouth shut .
i don't wanna ... get beaten up in there .
did you see that on video?
he hit him full tilt !
is the man well?
i'll still go in there , see that nothing happens .
but i don't wanna talk about obvious feelings .
it was right he got one , the jerk !
we could get insulted or injured any time .
if they do what we say , no problems , good feeling .
we gotta be more careful ... ... opposite the prisoners .
nobody comes near me any more !
the 5th day
what is it?
oh , god .
shit , how do you look?
guards , we need help !
not the guards !
no , please don't , not the guards !
we need someone who can help us !
no !
they want to kill me !
no !
you just have to go to a doctor .
no !
help me !
i don't want to !
86 , 23 , 74 , 94 , 15 ... ... 82 , 38 , 77 , 40 , 11 .
69 ... and 53 .
in exchange we have a new cell .
all light and sound proof , but you can get air inside .
i hope no one has a problem with enclosed spaces?
no , mr prison guard .
660 01 : 11 : 10, 500 > 01 : 11 : 15, 300 fine .
today is visiting day .
you may put on your good coats .
don't get them dirty .
understood?
yes , mr prison guard .
do you get a visitor too , 82?
no , mr prison guard .
why not?
don't you have a wife , kids , relatives?
no , mr prison guard .
and no friends !
no visitor !
dear tarek , you are the only one i can write a letter to ... ... because you're my only friend .
i hope i can do something for you someday .
you can always count on me .
your gunter .
are you a faggot , 82?
yes , 77?
was that attempted assault on a prison guard?
definitely .
because 77 still hasn't got the rules ... ... he'll clean the toilet with his dress .
no visitors until everything is impeccable !
i didn't know about that .
we agreed not to use the black box !
it's for psychological pressure only .
53 and 69 are in hospital .
82 is depressive .
we have extreme helplessness , loss of sense for reality ...
and disorientation , yes !
that's our field of research .
in five days we had submission to authority , subliminal violence ... ... and complete de individualization .
exactly !
we achieved our goal .
stop and present the results !
no !
we have a stable moment .
so far nothing is happening which we didn't expect .
there's no comparable data anywhere in the world .
we have nine more days .
if we stop now , we're giving away the chance of a lifetime .
perhaps it's a mistake .
i didn't realize what we were in for .
i have the feeling we're losing control .
jutta , what can happen?
we can intervene any time .
i can no longer be responsible .
what is that supposed to mean?
i'll meet the committee in three hours .
i need a clear decision from you .
do you still stand behind the project?
yes or no?
our nude cleaning lady !
there's still something sticking to the edge .
it will not work like this , 77 .
very nice !
enough !
706 01 : 14 : 41, 700 > 01 : 14 : 45, 900 what about the coat?
it's your coat , 77 .
put it on !
on the line !
very nice .
let's make a good impression .
no lies and no complaints to visitors !
we all feel very comfortable , don't we?
we all want to earn our money in peace and quiet .
right?
is that you , 77?
yes , mr prison guard .
whoever stinks gets no visitor .
all prisoners to the visiting room , 77 back to the cell !
i wanted to help you ...
then help me now !
what?
my visitor , you have to give him something from me .
that's impossible !
it's possible !
go to the caf and give this to him !
what is it?
doesn't matter .
i can't do it when the other guards are watching .
yes , you can , bosch .
please !
you don't look good !
how did you find me?
i saw the contract ... ... and talked ziegler into letting me take his place .
i live at your place .
how much longer will this last?
nine days .
i have to go back to canada .
you can leave here any time , right?
yes .
so , let's go !
there's a caf above us .
a guard will give you something from me .
visiting time is over !
take it to ziegler .
wait for me !
don't worry so much .
it'll be alright .
it's just a game .
tomorrow we're out .
i've got everything organized .
and we're gonna get the money !
then we'll all drive over to your kiosk ... ... and drink a nice cold beer .
all of us .
no stress or anything .
i promise !
you're off already?
no .
have to make a call , private .
nervous , bosch?
got something?
me?
no !
yes , you've got something !
are you the friend of mr. fahd?
yes .
you have something for me?
no .
tarek , he changed his mind .
i guess you know what he's talking about .
he didn't say anything else?
no .
yeah ...
then ...
thanks .
don't worry .
i'll make sure nothing happens to him .
bye .
is that necessary , mr. eckert?
it is .
i'm a cuddly bear .
you'll find out .
we got enough time !
i wouldn't be sure about that .
if it goes on like this ... ... i can stop the experiment any time .
i thought only the professor could do so .
he won't be back until tomorrow .
i'm responsible now .
what's up?
the late shift should have taken us out for the count .
your sense of time smells !
something else smells here !
i'll summarize .
77 is trying to bust the experiment with bosch and the girl .
dr grimm threatens to stop the whole thing .
and professor thon went away .
what are you trying to say?
i think this is a test .
how we react to outside disturbances .
nonsense !
77 has made trouble from the very beginning .
he might even be a calculated disturbing factor .
the asshole gets more than 4000?
what should we do now?
we seal ourselves off until professor thon returns .
cool !
we do our jobs , stick to the rules !
the rules say to react to all events appropriately .
shut your mouth !
professor , lars here .
the guards have beaten up bosch .
and i can't reach jutta .
i don't know what to do , it's urgent !
no connection .
we're going to take a little trip .
77 to the line !
77 and a guard attempted to attack the penitentiary .
thanks to the alertness of the guards ... ... this threat to the internal security could be prevented .
the guard has been suspended from duty .
he's one of you now .
into the cell !
dora was worried about you , 77 .
we had a long talk .
i took her home .
nice place .
she smells so good .
i'll take care of her personally later on .
professor thon , this is against the law and violates human rights !
i demand to abort this experiment !
77 into the black box !
this is torture !
stop the experiment !
77 will stay in the black box until his behavior is corrected .
you stinking pig !
you coward !
you dirty , rotten , shitty fucking nazi pig !
come out !
are you finished?
good .
into the black box !
look at me !
good evening , doctor .
please call professor thon .
what's going on here?
call him !
professor thon is unavailable .
nonsense !
what?
this is just a test .
you don't fool me !
this is just a test .
no , mr. berus !
the experiment is over now .
it has just been terminated .
bring her downstairs .
come along , doctor .
what do you think you're doing?
come !
don't touch me !
everything !
no !
give me the coat .
undress !
everything , please .
well , jutta , you shave your pussy !
eckert , stop that !
go downstairs !
put this on .
it went well .
sometimes one just has to remind people of simple things .
lars here .
the guards have beaten up bosch .
and i can't reach jutta .
i don't know what to do , it's urgent !
quickly , my car !
this mess you'll have to clean up yourself later , 82 .
out , the cell belongs to the lady !
listen !
whoever touches the tape ... ... will be sitting next to 82 .
this applies especially to the new prisoners !
how long this state of emergency lasts depends also on you !
don't tell me about some stupid test !
they said no violence !
stay calm !
shit !
this is an emergency .
we'll wait until professor thon is back .
they want to see if we can keep it up .
i just can't !
if you want to go , go !
no need to be afraid .
think about it !
i have to speak to mr. fahd !
it's against the rules .
i insist or i'll call the police .
come on !
you'll see everything is okay .
i'll try to arrange a meeting with tarek .
but you must promise not to tell anyone .
take care of schutte !
schutte !
it'll be alright .
stop it !
unlock the cells , let the people out !
now !
he's dead .
tarek , the man is dead .
we're going out now .
we're going through this door .
we can't get out of here .
we don't have a key for the elevator !
they'll just beat us up !
nonsense !
what's back there?
the basement .
supply corridors .
you can go directly to the medical school .
be quiet please or i'll get into trouble .
yeah , sure .
if you wait here for a moment , i'll see if i can get tarek .
would you like a cup of coffee?
no , thank you .
fine .
do you have a cell phone?
mine's got no power .
thanks , i'll make it quick .
no !
to the left !
we can't leave him lying there !
bosch !
you're one of us !
stop them !
that's an order !
you traitor pig !
i'll get you all !
they're breaking out !
come !
i'll get you !
the back way !
mr. berus , please be reasonable !
shut up !
mr. kamps , the experiment ...
quiet !
tie them to the bars .
the others must be in the medical school .
there's only one way out .
they don't stand a chance .
mr. eckert , what happened here?
i didn't want this !
i wanted ...
i thought that ...
wait , bosch !
it's over !
i have ...
can you hear me?
there you are !
i told you , i'll get you !
on the floor , hands back !
no !
stop it !
give me the gun !
it's not real anyway !
bitch !
the key , quick !
you started this !
you damned pig !
you killed schutte !
stop it .
it's over !
the sad outcome : two dead , three injured ... ... among them project leader professor klaus thon .
obviously the experiment got out of control after two days .
the district attorney is investigating 2 cases of suspected manslaughter ... ... and several cases of mistreatment and failure to provide assistance .
one of the test persons has been arrested .
the project directors will probably have to answer to a court .
according to statements by one of the scientists involved ... ... the escalation could've been prevented ... ... by earlier aborting the experiment .
