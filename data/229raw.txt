yesterday ...
december 7 , 1941 ... a date which will live in infamy ... the united states of america ... was suddenly and deliberately attacked ... by naval and air forces of the empire of japan .
it is obvious ... that planning the attack began many weeks ago .
during the intervening time ... the japanese government ... has deliberately sought to deceive the united states ... by false statements ... and expressions of hope for continued peace .
the attack yesterday on the hawaiian islands ... has caused severe damage to american military forces .
i regret to tell you ... that over 3, 000 american lives have been lost .
no matter how long it may take us ... to overcome this premeditated invasion ... the american people , in their righteous might ... will win through to absolute victory .
because of this unprovoked , dastardly attack by japan ...
i ask that the congress declare a state of war .
is it true ... men are still trapped alive inside the arizona?
we can hear tapping from inside the hull .
we're doing everything we can to get to them ... but they're forty feet below water .
we've been trained to think that we're invincible .
and now our proudest ships have been destroyed ... by an enemy we considered inferior .
we're on the ropes , gentlemen .
that's exactly why we have to strike back now .
we'll attack the marshall and gilbert islands , sir .
i mean hitting the heart of japan the way they have hit us .
mr. president ...
pearl harbor caught us unawares because we didn't face facts .
this isn't a time for ignoring them again .
we have long range bombers , but no place to launch them .
midway is too far , and russia won't allow us ... to launch a raid from there .
admiral?
navy's planes are small .
they carry light loads and have a short range .
we'd have to get them within a few hundred miles of japan .
we'd risk our carriers , and if we lose them ... we'll have no shield against invasion .
does anyone in this room think victory is possible ... without facing danger?
we are at war .
of course there's a risk .
but consider the risk , mr. president .
if the japanese invade us right now ... they would reach chicago before we could stop them .
gentlemen ... most of you did not know me when i had the use of my legs .
i was strong and proud ... and arrogant .
now i wonder , every hour of my life ... why god put me into this chair .
but when i see defeat in the eyes of my country men in your eyes , right now
i start to think that maybe he brought me down ... for times like these ... when we all need to be reminded who we truly are that we will not give up or give in .
mr. president , with all respect , sir ... what you're asking can't be done .
mr. president !
get back , george !
get back .
do not tell me ... it can't be done .
japan continues its military conquest ... throughout the pacific .
but , back home ... millions of american workers band together ... bringing factories to life to avenge pearl harbor .
mr. president , we have an idea how to bomb the japanese .
sir , it's risky ... but it's bold .
who are you?
i , sir?
captain low , mr. president .
he's a submariner .
he came up with this idea .
i like sub commanders .
they don't have time for bullshit , and neither do i.
fire away , gentlemen .
and where is god in all this?
our enemies believe a divine wind protects them .
but we see our friends laid out here before us .
hey , captain .
lieutenants rafe mccawley , daniel walker .
yes , major?
you're both going stateside .
fly out in two hours .
what for , sir?
ask colonel doolittle .
yes , sir .
you're packing .
orders .
what kind of orders?
the top secret kind .
the dangerous kind .
i can't find danny .
is that why you're here?
looking for danny?
probably saying good bye to his squadron .
we've been assigned to doolittle .
i wasn't looking for danny .
i couldn't have you go away ... without you understanding something .
yeah .
you don't have to explain anything .
i do , because you're acting like i didn't love you .
evelyn , loving you kept me alive .
i should've died over there .
when i was in that water , i made a deal with god .
i told him i was sorry ... that i knew i'd been a fool for leaving you ... trying to go over there and be a hero ... and i promised i'd never ask for anything again ... if i could just see you one more time .
and you know what?
it was worth it .
you kept me alive , evelyn .
you brought me home .
so i'm gonna stand by my end of the deal .
i'm gonna walk away .
and i won't ask you for anything .
but i just want to know why .
just tell me that , will you , please?
just tell me why .
rafe , i'm pregnant .
oh , my god .
i didn't even know until the day you turned up alive .
and then all this happened .
i haven't told danny .
i don't want him to know .
all he needs to think about ... is how to do this mission and get back alive .
rafe , all i ever wanted ... was for us to have a home , grow old together ... but life never asked me what i wanted .
now , i'm gonna give danny my whole heart ... but i don't think i'll ever look at another sunset ... without thinking of you .
i'll love you my whole life .
i'll see you on board .
you know , the only thing that scares me ... is that you might love him more than you love me .
i love you , danny .
and i'll be here waiting for you when you come back .
follow me .
colonel .
congratulations on your promotion , sir .
i heard what you did .
we can explain that , sir .
explain what?
whatever it is you heard about us , sir .
you mean the hula shirts you were flying in?
or the seven planes you shot down?
you're both being awarded the silver star ... and promoted to captain .
is that the good news , sir , or ...
you're just about the only pilots in the army ... with combat experience .
i need you for a mission ...
i've been ordered to put together .
you know what top secret is?
yes , sir .
it's the kind of mission where you get medals .
but they send 'em to your relatives .
top secret means you train for something ... never done before in aviation history ... and you go without knowing where you're going .
you do it on that basis or not at all .
i'll go , sir .
i'll go , too , sir .
by the way , the brits sent over your personal effects .
thank you , sir .
there's only one more thing .
leave your goddamn hula shirts at home .
dear rafe ...
it's so strange to be this far from you ... but you should know this every night ...
i've been looking all over for you .
danny , this ... this ain't no time to leave things unsaid .
now , we gotta face facts here .
the fact is , we just both love the same woman .
she's the first girl i ever felt this way about , rafe .
i couldn't help what happened any more than you could .
this is different , though , danny .
evelyn already lost the man she loved once .
i just don't want it to see that happen to her again .
guys like us got no choice .
this is war .
she knows that .
danny , don't do this .
don't go on this mission .
you got nothing to prove .
you've been protecting me since we were kids .
yeah , well ... you do tend to need it from time to time .
the mission i'm asking you to volunteer for ... is exceptionally dangerous .
take a look at the man beside you .
it's a good bet that in the next six weeks ... you or he ... will be dead .
everyone brave enough to accept this ... step forward .
your grandmother could take a b 25 off ... on a mile long runway .
well , i'm gonna train you to do it in 467 feet .
because at 468 feet ... you're dead .
and once you get it up ... you'll learn to fly it like a fighter ... thirty feet off the ground .
i want you to say hello ... to lieutenant jack richards , navy aviation .
he'll help us lighten these fat ladies .
dump that ash can .
dump that ash can .
see that bomb sight?
get rid of it .
colonel , he's crazy !
the lady's fat !
listen to him .
she's fat .
we want a skinny lady !
max power !
get up , get up !
damn !
how the heck
damn !
they just keep rolling past that line .
maybe it's a bad idea .
no , they're too heavy .
we gotta get drastic .
this armored plating goes .
i'm sure , i'm sure .
lose it like a skirt , son .
release brakes !
come on , come on !
god !
put every man on the line !
let's show these boys how this thing is done !
come on !
max power .
well , if he can do it ...
well , gentlemen , now i can tell you ... that we're going to tokyo .
and we're gonna bomb it .
that comes as a special request ... directly from president roosevelt .
the navy'll sneak us about 400 miles off the coast ... and we'll launch from the carrier there .
has that been done before?
taking army bombers off navy carriers?
no .
ok .
any other questions?
well , sir , is it even possible to land ... a b 25 on an aircraft carrier deck?
that won't matter .
as soon as we're airborne , the carrier heads for hawaii .
but without them , where do we land?
i have a phrase i want you to memorize .
wo shimeiguo ren .
it means " i am an american " .
in chinese .
ain't gonna be any easier .
that's three feet shorter than our practice runway .
fellas?
sir .
sir .
secretary of the navy gave me these .
what are they?
friendship medals the japanese gave us ... when they were pretending to want peace .
what'll you do with them?
wire them to the bombs and give them back .
so what's going on?
well , sir , we only have sixteen planes .
so?
when the japs hit us , they had more than 300 .
how much difference can we make?
it's not that we're afraid , sir .
but we might die , and we want to know what it's for .
you know , at pearl , they hit us with a sledgehammer .
this raid , even if we make it through ... it'll only be a pin prick ... but it'll be straight through their hearts .
victory belongs to those that believe in it the most ... and believe in it the longest .
we're gonna believe .
we're gonna make america believe , too .
colonel?
i need a minute .
excuse me , major jackson?
yes?
do you remember me?
oh , sure i do .
i'm sorry .
i've been meaning to thank you .
well , maybe you can .
when the news comes in about the doolittle boys ...
i want to be in the command post .
i'm sorry .
i don't know what you're talking about .
how the hell do you know about this mission?
let's call it an inadvertent disclosure .
some flyboy you're dating shot his mouth off .
actually , it's about two pilots .
i know they're going into great danger .
i just want to be there when the news tells us ... if they've lived or died .
most officers would have thrown you in the brig .
most nurses wouldn't keep their fingers ... plugged in your artery .
i can't promise you anything .
hey , red , you think they picked us ... to do this 'cause we're young and dumb?
come on , gooz , we're the tip of the sword .
in honor of our trip to japan ...
i got us some victory cigars !
yeah !
there you go .
put that in your insidepocket , next to your heart .
you know , jack , we may lose this battle ... but we're gonna win this war .
you know how i know?
no .
them .
'cause they're rare .
and at times like these , you see them ... stepping forward .
there's nothing stronger than the heart of a volunteer , jack .
my friends in the war department ... don't want me to lead this raid ... because they say i'm too valuable .
they don't want me up in the air ... flying with the men that i've chosen ... that i've chewed out , cussed out , pushed to the limit ... and that i've come to respect .
they want me to stand on the flight deck ... and wave you off .
well , i don't see it that way .
so i'm going with you .
we take off tomorrow afternoon ... drop our fire , and head for china .
our mission is to hit military targets ... aircraft and tankfactories .
colonel , you've given us homing beacons ... but you said china is overrun with japanese troops .
what if the beacons are switched off?
bring her down any way you can ... and do your best to avoid capture .
what if we have to bail out over japan?
well , in that situation , i can't tell you what to do .
what would you do , colonel?
i wasn't built to be a prisoner ... so i would have my crew bail out .
i'd find the sweetest military target i could ... and drive my plane right smack into the middle of it ... and kill as many of those bastards as i could .
but that's just me .
i'm forty five years old .
i'm an old man .
you guys have your whole lives ahead of you ... so what you do is up to you .
the mission will launch in a couple of hours .
you'll stay right in here .
here .
stay here .
don't talk to them .
they won't talk to you .
pretend to type the information we pass you .
that's it .
this is orphan annie from radio tokyo .
to all the lonely boys in the south pacific ... watch out the enemy will get you .
maybe she's right .
japs transmitting !
captain , radar reports japanese patrol boats .
range 400 yards .
how many yards?
400 yards and closing , sir .
richards , japs !
400 yards !
let's go !
admiral halsey's ordering the cruisers to open fire !
we gotta sink these jap boats before they give us away .
go to general quarters !
go , go , go , go !
oh , my god .
this can't be good !
all hands , man your battle stations .
japs one mile away .
they reported our position .
supposed to launch 400 miles away .
how far are we?
624 miles .
jesus !
what do you want to do?
colonel , i don't know if the planes ... can carry enough fuel to make it to china .
now .
we launch now !
army pilots !
man your planes !
man your planes !
they're shooting at something .
let's go !
it ain't a drill !
colonel !
we're too far out to make it !
they need more fuel , but they can't get too heavy !
strip everything out of this plane you don't need now !
start pre flight !
let's go !
add ten cans of fuel for each plane !
every plane !
let's go !
move !
guys , get upthere !
lose those suitcases now !
what's your favorite gun?
what?
you want off this deck , give me a gun now !
it's still too heavy !
go to the kitchen , get some broomsticks .
cut 'em down , paint 'em black , and bring them here .
we'll put a broomstick where this gun was .
what are you doing to my plane?
tell your crew to take a piss before they take off .
we got broomsticks for tail guns .
yeah .
maybe it'll scare 'em .

there will be no homing beacons .
the plane carrying them crashed en route to china ... and our bombers may lack the fuel ... to reach the mainland , sir .
so our boys are flying blind on empty tanks .

we're still not getting a signal .
all ocean and no land .
homing in on nothing .

they're chinese .
when the action is over and we look back ... we understand both more and less .
this much is certain .
before the doolittle raid ...
america knew nothing but defeat .
after it , nothing but victory .
japan realized for the first time that they could lose ... and began to pull back .
america realized that she would win ... and surged forward .
it was a war that changed america .
dorie miller was the first black american ... to be awarded the navy cross .
but he would not be the last .
he joined a brotherhood of heroes .
that's for all the raiders .
world war ii for us began at pearl harbor ... and 1, 177 men still lie entombed ... in the battleship arizona .
america suffered ... but america grew stronger .
it was not inevitable .
the times tried our souls ... and through the trial , we overcame .
hey , danny ... how'd you like to go flying?
come here .
when i think back on these times
and the dreams we left behind
i'll be glad 'cause i was blessed
to get to have you in my life
when i look back on these days
i'll look and see your face
you were right there for me
in my dreams i'll always see you
soar above the sky
in my heart , there'll always be a place for you
for all my life
i'll keep a part of you with me
and everywhere i am
there you'll be
and everywhere i am
there you'll be
well , you showed me how it feels
feel the sky with in my reach
and i always will remember
all the strength you gave to me
your love made me make it through
oh , i owe so much to you
you were right there for me
in my dreams i'll always see you
soar above the sky
in my heart , there'll always be
a place for you
for all my life
i'll keep a part of you with me
and everywhere i am
there you'll be
'cause i always saw in you my light
my strength
and i want to thank you now
for all the ways
you were right there for me

you were right there for me
for always
in my dreams i'll always see you
