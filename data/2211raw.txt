the way he took care of penny .
i mean the way he was with you .
it's really me it has to do with .
johnny , i came here because my father
no .
the way he saved her i could never do anything like that .
that was something .
people treat me like i'm nothing because i am nothing .
that's not true !
you're everything !
you don't understand the way it is for somebody like me .
last month i'm eating candy to stay alive .
this month , women are stuffing diamonds in my pockets .
i'm balancing on shit and i can be down there again .
no , it's not the way it is !
it doesn't have to be that way !
i've never known anyone like you .
you think you can make the world better .
somebody's lost , you find them .
somebody's bleeding
i go get my daddy .
that's really brave , like you said .
that took a lot of guts to go to him !
you are not scared of anything .
i'm scared of everything !
i'm scared of what i saw .
i'm scared of what i did , who i am .
i'm scared of walking out of here and never feeling for the rest of my life ... the way i feel when i'm with you !

i was going to sing in the show .
it's the big event .
people bring their own arrangements .
you don't want to miss it .
baby , i need you for props .
why would you want to leave early?
it was just an idea .
we can stay if you want to .
so , what were you planning to sing?
" i feel pretty .

i got a lesson with the kramers .
they'll kill each other if i'm not there .
well , sure .
you've gotta go .
i'll see ya .
it's rainy day game time .

god , i am so sick of this rain .
remind me not to take my honeymoon at niagara falls .
so , you go to acapulco .
it'll be fine .
where is my beige iridescent lipstick?
i know i put it in this drawer .
baby , where are you going in this weather?
uh , they're having charades in the west lobby .
quite the little joiner , aren't we?
have you had many women?
what?
baby , come on .
tell me .
i want to know .
you gotta understand what it's like .
you come from the streets and suddenly you're up here .
women are throwing themselves at you and they smell so good .
they really take care of themselves .
i never knew women could be like that .
they're so goddamn rich you think they must know about everything .
they're slippin 'their room keys in my hand two and three times a day different women so , i think i'm scorin 'big , right?
you think , " they wouldn't be doing this if they didn't care about me , right?
that's all right .
i understand .
you were just using them , that's all .
no , that's not it .
that's the thing .
it wasn't like that .
they were using me .
what's your real name , baby?
frances , for the first woman in the cabinet .
frances .
that's a real grownup name .
i've decided to go all the way with robbie .
no , not with someone like him .
do you think if we came back for a ten year anniversary , it would be free?
it's just wrong this way .
it should be with someone
with someone that you sort of love .
come on .
you don't care about me .
you wouldn't care if i humped the entire army ... as long as we were on the right side of the ho chi minh trail .
what you care about is that you're not daddy's girl anymore .
he listens when i talk now .
you hate that .
two , three , cha cha cha .
my frame .
where's my pleasing arc?
spaghetti arms !
would you give me some tension , please?
you're invading my dance space .
this is my dance space .
that's yours .
let's cha cha .
don't look down .
look right here .
how you call your lover boy?
come here , lover boy .
and if he doesn't answer?
oh , lover boy .
and if still doesn't answer?
i simply say ...
baby
o oh , baby
my sweet baby
you're the one
takin 'dance lessons?
i could teach ya , kid .
my grandfather put me in charge of the final show .
i want to talk to you about the last dance .
i'd like to shake things up a bit .
you know , move with the times .
i've got a lot of ideas .
i've been working with the staff kids ... on a cross between a cuban rhythm and soul dancing .
whoa , boy .
way over your head here .
you always do the mambo , huh?
why not dance this year's final dance ... to the pachenga?
right .
well , you're free to do the same , tired number as last year if you want ... but next year we'll find another dance person ...
who'll only be too happy  sure , neil .
no problem .
we'll end the season with the pachenga .
great idea .
sometimes he's hard to talk to , but the ladies seem to like him .
see that he gives you the full half hour you're paying him for , kid .
that little wimp .
he wouldn't know a new idea if it hit him in the pachenga .
i could have told him some new ideas .
why did you let him talk to you that way?
what , fight the boss man?
you tell him your ideas .
he's a person like everyone else .
look , i know these people .
they are rich and they're mean .
they won't listen to me .
why not fight harder?
make them listen .
because i need this goddamned job lined up for next summer .
my dad calls me today .
good news , " he says .
uncle paul can finally get you in the union .
what union?
the house painters and plasterers local number 179 at your service .
i've been thinking a lot about the domino theory .
now , when viet nam falls , is china next?
i don't think they saw us .
fight harder , huh?
i don't see you fightin 'so hard , tellin 'daddy i'm your guy .
i will .
with my father , it's complicated .
i will tell him .
i don't believe you , baby .
i don't think ... that you ever had any intention of telling him .
ever .
well , cousin , it's almost over .
labor day weekend is here .
well , cousin , it's almost over .
labor day weekend is here .
soon it's back to the old books and back to work .
what a terrible thought !
have you seen johnny?
i'm sorry .
looks like i picked the wrong sister .
that's okay , baby .
i went slummin 'too .
hit me .
get out of here .
you're not worth it .
win big , moe .
as always .
this is our last night together , lover .
i've got something worked out for us .
excuse me , sir .
the pirate number's next .
oh , thanks .
hey , kid .
i've been playing cards all weekend and i've got an all night game tonight .
why don't you give my wife some extra dance lessons?
i'm sorry , mr. pressman ... but i'm booked up for the whole weekend with the show .
i won't have time for anything else .
i don't think it'd be fair to take the money .
i've decided tonight's the night with robbie .
he doesn't even know yet .
it's me .
holy shit !
you wanna hear somethin 'crazy?
last night l
i dreamt we were walking along and we met your father .
he said , " come on , " and he put his arm around me .
just like he did with robbie .
you know how you feel when you see a patient and you think he's all right ... then you look at the x rays and it's nothing like you thought?
what happened?
it's exactly what it's like when you find out one of your staff's a thief .
moe pressman's wallet was stolen when he was playing pinochle last night .
it was in his jacket hanging on the back of his chair .
he had it at 1 : 30 and when he checked again at quarter of 4 :: 00 ... it was missing .
vivian thinks she remembers this dance kid johnny ... walking by .
so we ask him , " you have an alibi for last night?
he says he was alone in his room reading .
there are no books in johnny's room !
there's been a mistake .
i know johnny didn't do it .
there's been similar thefts at the sheldrake .
it's happened here before .
three other wallets .
i know he didn't do it .
stay out of it , baby .
wait .
don't put those tables together .
come on .
daddy , i need your help .
i know johnny didn't take moe's wallet .
oh?
how do you know?
i can't tell you .
just please trust me , daddy .
i'm sorry , baby .
i can't .
this danish is pure protein .
maybe johnny didn't do it .
anyone could've taken it .
maybe it was , uh
it could've been that little , old couple , the schumachers .
i saw her with a couple of wallets .
sylvia and sidney?
baby , you don't go around accusing innocent people .
i even saw them at the sheldrake .
you said something was stolen from there .
i got an eyewitness and the kid has no alibi .
come on , neil .
you'll learn what it's like to fire an employee .
wait a minute .
i know johnny didn't take the wallet .
i know because he was in his room all night .
and the reason i know is because i was with him .
i told you i was telling the truth .
i'm sorry i lied to you .
but you lied too .
you told me everyone was alike and deserved a fair break .
but you meant everyone who is like you .
you told me you wanted me to change the world , to make it better .
but you meant by becoming a lawyer or an economist ... and marrying someone from harvard .
i'm not proud of myself .
but i'm in this family too .
you can't keep giving me the silent treatment .
there are a lot of things about me that aren't what you thought .
but if you love me , you have to love all the things about me .
and i love you .
i'm sorry i let you down .
i'm so sorry , daddy .
but you let me down too .
i have been lookin 'for you all over .
they found the schumachers .
fingerprinted their water glasses .
found out they were wanted in arizona and in florida ... and they made a fortune here this summer .
so then it's all right .
i knew it would work out .
i knew they'd have to apologize .
i'm out , baby .
they fired you anyway because of me .
and if i leave quietly , i'll get my summer bonus .
so i did it for nothing .
i hurt my family , you lost your job anyway i did it for nothing !
no , not for nothing .
nobody has ever done anything like that for me before .
you were right .
you can't win no matter what you do .
listen to me .
i don't want to hear that from you .
you can .
i used to think so .
dr. houseman , can i , uh
look , i'm going anyway and i know what you must be thinking .
you don't know anything at all about me .
i know you want baby to be like you .
the kind of person people look up to .
baby is like that .
if you could just see
don't you tell me what to see .
i see someone in front of me who got his partner in trouble ... and sent her off to some butcher ... while he moved on to an innocent , young girl like my daughter .
yeah , i guess that's what you would see .
i can't imagine being here without you even one day .
just think , you have more time for horseshoes and croquet .
maybe they'll saw you in seven pieces now .
i guess we surprised everybody .
i guess we did .
hardly would be sorry .
neither will l .
i'll see ya .
i'll do your hair .
it could look pretty if
you're prettier your way .
this way .
kellermans , we come together
singing all as one
we have shared another season's
talent , play and fun
summer days will soon be over
soon the autumn starts
and tonight the memories whisper
softly in our hearts
join hands and hearts and voices
voices , hearts and hands
at kellerman's the friendships last
long as the mountain stands
daytime , nighttime , any hour
weather rain or shine
games and lectures jokes and music
happily combine
good luck in medical school , son .
and i wanted to thank you for your help with the penny situation .
i guess we've all gotten into messes .
what?
i thought baby told you .
look , i'm not sure .
penny said so , but you know with girls like that .
they're liable to pin it ... on any guy around .
what's the hot tip for the day?
finished .
you and me , tito .
we've seen it all , eh?
bubbah and zeda serving the first pasteurized milk to the boarders .
through the war years when we didn't have any meat .
through the depression when we didn't have anything .
lots of changes , though , max .
it's not the changes so much this time .
it's that it all seems to be ending .
you think kids want to come with their parents and take fox trot lessons?
trips to europe , that's what the kids want .
twenty two countries in three days .
it feels like it's all slipping away .
but the heartbeats of vacation
there no cares are seen
so let's join in just one last chorus
visitors , staff and guests
what we've shared won't be forgotten
old friends are the best
nobody puts baby in the corner .
come on .
sorry about the disruption , folks ... but i always do the last dance of the season .
this year somebody told me not to .
so i'm gonna do my kind of dancin 'with a great partner ... who's not only a terrific dancer ... but somebody who's taught me that there are people ... willing to stand up for other people no matter what it costs them .
somebody who's taught me ... about the kind of person i want to be .
miss frances houseman .
sit down , jake .
i think she gets this from me .
do you have sheet music on this stuff?
i know you weren't the one who got penny in trouble .
when i'm wrong , i say i'm wrong .
you looked wonderful out there .
now i
had the time of my life
no , i never felt this way before
yes , i swear
it's so true and i owe it all to you
