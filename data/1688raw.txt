basically you're getting twice the bass ... with the tk241 , which we've ... got available in this system .
i don't know .
i don't really know if i need all that bass .
i think you need all that bass .
if you want a system to handle what you want ... you need the bass .
this is hi fi .
high fidelity .
that means this is the highest quality fidelity .
hi fi .
two important things to have in a stereo system .
it's the price .
i have this unit in my home .
really?
yes , i do .
but , of course , i got it modified with the tk421 .
which kicks it up another ... 3 or 4 ... quads per channel , you know?
but that's technical talk .
that doesn't concern you .
you're still a little uncertain .
you know what you need?
a test drive .
you need a test drive .
it's one thing to hear it from buck's mouth .
it's another thing to hear it from the tk421 .
let me pop in this 8 track .
listen , and tell me what you think .
hear that?
you hear the bass .
right?
you hear it?
it kicks !
it turns !
it curls up your belly .
it makes you wanna freaky deaky , right?
now if you get the system as is ... it won't sound like this without the tk421 modification .
and we do that in the store right here .
very small price .
move with it if you need to .
it helps me .
thank you for your time .
well , so long , partner .
what the fuck was that?
have i told you?
have i?
what?
you put on a country western shit , no one'll buy a stereo .
what kind of brother listens to that shit?
look , jerry ...
no , no , no .
you look .
i gave you a job because ...
i thought your acting stuff might bring nice pussy in .
and it has .
but i can't have anymore fuck ups .
you dig?
you dig?
yeah , i dig .
now get in the back and unload those new 484's .
all right .
sorry .
settle down , class .
this is your final .
keep your test papers facedown until i tell you to turn them up .
clear your tables , please .
there should be nothing on your desk but the test and a pencil .
we're covering chapters 17 through 28 .
your eyes should stay on your test papers , please .
are we ready?
class , begin .
i love to suck cock .
i love to suck cock .
honey?
you okay?
sweetheart?
is something wrong?
i got to get back .
i need it again .
i have to go to work .
come on , give it to me .
don't make me pounce you .
i'll do it .
you promise?
that's it .
you want it?
how bad?
bad .
you sure?
you asked for it !
god . wait .
stop !
what?
your cock is so beautiful .
do you know how good you are doing it , eddie?
having sex?
fucking me?
making love to me?
everyone has one thing .
everyone's given one special thing , right?
that's right .
everyone's blessed with one special thing .
i want you to know i plan on being a star .
a big bring shining star .
that's what i want .
that's what i'm going to get .
i know .
i got to go .
you're lucky .
you want a ride?
you want a ride?
i'm going really far .
do you remember me from a couple hours ago?
yeah , i remember .
come with us , sweetie .
this is a really cool car .
what i'm trying to tell you ... is that it takes a lot ... of the good american old green stuff to make one of these things , you know?
you've got your camera , you've got your film ...
you got your lights , your sound , your lab costs ... you got devloping , your synching , your editing .
before you turn around ... you've spent maybe 20 , 25 , 30 thousand dollars on a movie .
that's a lot .
you bet your ass it is .
but if you make a good one ... there's practically no end to how much money you can make .
have you seen jack's house?
he will .
he'll see it .
you got maybe 15 , 20 guys standing around just ... making sure that your lighting is right .
but you can work out in the morning , you can work out at noon , at night .
it doesn't matter .
if you don't have those juices flowing in the mr. torpedo area ... in the fun zone .
but you must get people in the theater .
you need the big dicks , the big tits ...
here we go .
how do you keep them in the theater after they've come?
with beauty ... and with acting .
i understand you've got to get them in the theater ... keep the seats full .
but i don't want to make a film ... where they sit down , jack off ... and they get up and get out before the story ends .
it is my dream , it is my goal ... it is my idea to make a film ... that the story just sucks them in ... and when they spurt out that joy juice , they just got to sit in it .
they can't move ... until they find out how the story ends .
i want to make a film like that .
i understand they have to make films , i've made them myself ... that are a few laughs ... everybody fucks their brains out .
and that's fine .
but it's my dream ... to make a film ... that is true ... and right ... and dramatic .
you want a fresca?
no thanks .
are you sure?
you're out of limes , jack .
check in the kitchen , darling .
i'm going to bed .
good night , jackie .
don't stay up too late .
good night , beauty .
good night , eddie .
glad you came by .
you're great .
thank you .
she's the best .
she's a wonderful mother .
she's a mother to all those who need love .
she's really nice .
you know what i'm thinking?
i want to be in business with you .
really?
what do you think?
i'd love it .
what do you think of rollergirl?
she's great .
would you like to do it?
have sex?
yeah .
yeah , i'd love to .
she's really foxy .
you bet your ass it is .
you're officially out of limes .
i'll pick up some for you tomorrow .

i want you to get over there and sit on the couch with eddie .
here we go .
are we going to fuck?
oh , yes .

i know .
anyway , listen .
for the shoot , i want to see about getting this new zoom lens .
i was wondering if we'd be able to get more lights too .
jack wants a minimal thing .
very often , minimal means a lot more photographically than people understand .
i understand .
i know you understand .
i mean other people .
i think what jack is talking about is minimal .
not natural , but minimal .
okay , fine .
i understand .
i want to give each film its own look .
can we talk about this later?
you got to go somewhere or ...
yeah .
no , i mean ...
i was hoping , for the shoot tomorrow , we could send rocky down to pick it up .
no , got you .
you got to go somewhere .
so what the fuck?
it's only the photography of the film .
are you giving me shit?
no .
no way , little bill .
my fucking wife has an ass in her cock in the driveway !

i'm sorry if my thoughts are not on the photography of the film !
okay .
no big deal .
sorry .
got you .
all right , where is it?
she's sick .
what the fuck is this?
i didn't do anything?
is she breathing?
i don't know .
maybe she did too much coke .

i want you to handle this for me , johnny .
you listening?
drive her to saint joe's .
drop her off in the front .
understand me?

this is twice in 2 days that a chick has od'ed on me !
think it means you should think about getting new shit?
yes sir .

with all this conversation !
come on !
please don't die !

the camera loves you .
i didn't get the come shot .
we missed the come shot .
he came inside her .
maybe we could go to stock footage .

it won't match .
i could do it again if you need a close up .
here we go .
everyone say , " dirk !
there are real wood .
these are great .
those are cool are they lizard?
no , they're italian .
i'm going to fucking buy these .
guys?
it's funny you say that because we should be in a band .
you like my shoes?
pretty cool .
i got them with reed and scotty .
they're cool .
they're embossed leather with this patchwork reptilian pattern design .
can we have some hot sauce?
want to sit down and help yourself? .
say hello to jaime lynn .
scotty .
so , you're a leo?
my girlfriend wants to meet you .
this is raymond .
what's your name?
excuse me?
becky barnett !
raymond's a leo .
i knew it .
what's your sign?
i'm a pisces .
what?
i can't deal with no pisces .
that shirt's pretty sexy .
this is , like , imported italian nylon .
and it's , like , a special edition limited silk print .
and it was done by this really famous ... design artist from italy .
pick a card .
what's up , baby?
i love you !
i'm going to cut the deck one time , all right?
now i'm going to make your card rise from the deck .
damn !
2 of diamonds , right?
that's my card !
but doesn't it make you nervous when you're dealing with those evil forces?
horses?
what?
no , the evil forces !
evil?
no , man , it's not evil .
it's an illusion .
yeah , it's confusing .
thank you .
we're going to try and do this all in one shit !
so , we start like this , and then you roll her over , dirk .
roll with him , but try to give me every single position .
is that possible?
rollergirl , if you wrap your leg around ... no , the left one .
around and over .
good .
see , we can go right into doggy style .
perfect .
is the movement on the waterbed a problem?
no , not at all , kurt , i dig it .
it's great .
okay , can we do this?
yeah .
all right , everybody .
here we go .
this is going to be great .
do you want me to use the spanish accent?
jack horner has found something special in newcomer dirk diggler .
it's another stellar sexual standout from horner and company .
digger delivers a performance worth a thousand hard ons .
his presence when dressed is powerful and demanding .
stripped to the bone ,
diggler's more eruptive than a volcano on a bad day .
amber waves 'cherry lips do a great job of handling diggler's wide load ...
rocking reed rothchild's stiff biceps do a slapping good job ... job with becky barnett's supple ass .
but it's dirk diggler that remains the stand out in this film .
it's easy to predict after only 2 films
diggler's suck cess can only grow ... and grow and grow and grow and grow and grow and grow and grow and grow .
what else?
that's it for now .
look at the character holmes came up with .
and look , i just ...
tell me .
i don't like seeing women treated that way .
the guy who plays johnny wadd .
it's always about slapping a girl around .
it's not right .
it's not cool .
it's just not sexy .
it's not sexy like it should be .
the guy's more like a james bond type character .
you know , he's classy .
he's a world traveled guy .
i like that .
reed could play my partner .
i like that a lot .
we could make it really good , jack .
honestly , if you direct it , we make a whole series with a whole story .
it's exactly what we've always talked about .
please .
when we get back ... set up the typewriter .
we'll see what comes out of it .
but i have to talk to the colonel when we get to vegas .
you must work on the colonel too , you must be committed .
right , right , jack .
i'll do whatever i have to do .
does this character have a name?
his name is " brock landers .
and his partner's name is " chest rockwell .
those are great names !
and the award for " best newcomer " goes to ... yes , my baby boy , dirk diggler !
and the award for " best cock " goes to ... and here we go again , dirk diggler !
the award for " best actor " goes to ...
i've seen all his movies and i can't wait to work with him !
mr. dirk diggler !
i don't know what to say .
i guess the only thing i can say is ...
i'll promise to keep rocking and rolling and making better films .
you know , it seems we makes these movies ... and sometimes they're considered filthy or something by some people .
but i don't think that's true .
these movies we make , they can be better .
they can help , they really can .
i mean that !
we can always do better .
i'm going to keep trying , if you guys keep trying .
let's keep rocking and rolling .
shot of tequila , straight up .
yes , ma'am .
i've been in this place for 20 minutes just to get a seat .
are you alone?
yeah .
just visiting la .
some people told me the food in here was really good .
it's not good .
it's the best place to eat in all of la .
it's excellent .
i hope so .
i could die of starvation before i get something in my mouth .
still hungry?
starving .
why don't you feast on that .
oh , it's true .
what's that?
you are brock landers .
freeze !
don't make me chase you , raphael !
freeze !
we're almost there .
i want you to trim the head .
take the shot of reed with the revolver .
just dump it and switch the title card .
i want it to come flying out of the screen at the audience .
nice .
piece of cake .
that's my guy .
i told him , this is a special party for scotty j.
i want your lightest , bubbliest champagne .
this is what he gave me .
take a sip of this and tell me what you think .
this is supposed to be really good stuff .
here , take a sip .
is that pretty light?
yeah , that is .
what do you think?
it's beautiful !
look how spacious it is .
yeah , look .
i like these .
that's custom made .
that's real italian leather .
watch this .
what's that?
my initials .
that's imaginative !
how'd you think of that?
i was thinking of my name and dreamt it up .
i'm almost finished .
it looks great .
i used a little poetic license to capture your essence .
it looks great .
it's a good piece for conversation .
it's really neat .
jesse did all that oil painting as well .
buck is still installing the stereo .
that's a bean bag !
and that lamp ... those are real sterling silver .
it's a very interesting room .
it has a very modern feel too .
watch this .
you ready?
can't wait to see it .
it's my dojo .
it's all asian !
an asian room !
it has that whole karate feel .
it's very comfortable .
yeah .
a lot of ancient china .
i have my statues for my best actor awards .
a good place to keep your awards .
i'm glad .
look up there .
oh , that's handy .
can you see yourself? .
yeah .
it's great , huh?
it's my whole , entire wardrobe .
it's all perfectly organized for me by color as well as designer .
you don't have to think about it or anything .
you'll love it .
this is my favorite thing in the world .
close your eyes .
okay , you ready?
yeah , baby .
isn't it beautiful?
oh , god .
this is it .
this is the thing .
you deserve this , baby .
isn't it great?
this is the most beautiful thing i've ever seen .
want to go for a ride?
oh , yeah !
she rocks !
hold on !
you set us up , chico .
fuck with raphael and ringo , that's your business .
don't fuck with chest !
you know what?
you're not even worth it !
i gave you a chance !
i trusted him .
well , we almost solved the case .
at least the women are safe .
let's go get some of that saturday night beaver .
no one fucks with chest and brock .
this is the best work we've ever done .
it's a real film , jack .
it feels good .
you made it fly .
this is the film ...
i want them to remember me by .
thank you .
as far as i'm concerned , it's all about love .
you know what i mean?
if you love someone , how hard can the world be?
peole will come and they will go , and so will problems , but ultimately ... if you have got love on your side , and it is just ...
i mean , it is just deep down in your soul ... what's a problem that takes your attention away from that?
do you understand?
i'm becky barnett .
jerome .
nice to meet you .
nice to meet you , too , becky .
so , what do you do?
i'm in the auto industry .
i'm a regional manager over at pep boys .
that's great , that's great .
you've got a really nice smile , becky .
thank you ...
jerome .
the colonel .
floyd gondolli !
great you could make it .
great , great !
how are you?
you look happy .
i'm fine .
meet boys , tommy , pete .
meet girls , cyndi , angie .
these are the next stars .
there are the real people in the world .
i think we ought to talk to jack .
iron this thing out before the new year?
let's do it .
but what were you thinking?
what were you feeling?
did you do research?
what are you talking about here?
oh , nothing .
want to come with me for a while?
where?
it's a surprise , surprise , surprise .
yeah , let's go .
excuse me , jessie .
hey , buck .
hey , jessie .
how you doing?
are you sitting alone?
yes .
todd parker !
rocking reed rothchild !
you made it !
it's an amazing party .
fucking chicks everywhere .
you bet .
courtesy of jack horner , thank you .
i wouldn't mind me having a piece of that action over there .
michelle .
i'll introduce you .
sure .
introduce her to my lap .
did you get off work?
don't dance sunday nights .
who's vette is that in the driveway?
dirk .
i'm jealous of him .
that shit's jamming .
start down low with a 350 cube .
3 1/ 4 horsepower , 4 speed , 4 10 gears ... 10 coats of orange , hand rubbed lacquer with a dual plane manifold .
full fucking race cams .
i'm pretty happy with it , you know?
it's a great look for you , i think .
it's pretty original , you know , i think .
take this off .
what were we talking about before?
oil painting?
no .
no , yes !
i mean , but i was saying that ...
sunsets !
right , yeah .
i was saying that i love sunsets .
but sunrises are better .
exactly .
i thought i was the only one who felt that way .
no , i feel that way .
really?
yes really .
have you heard my stereo system?
no .
i'm going to open my own business .
really?
yes .
it's my dream , okay?
it's hi fi stereo equipment at discount prices .
it's called " buck's super stereo world .
that is a fucking great idea .
you know , in the 80's that's when it's going to happen .
for real .
really?
yes , really .
in the 80's .
i wanted you to come in so i could tell you how much i love you .
it'll be a new year and we're going to start things , and do things ... and i just wanted you to know how much i care about you .
i really care about you , honey .
you're my little baby .
you're the best thing that's happened to me since my son went off .
i love you , honey .
i love you , too .
fucking 1980 , you know?
can you believe it?
i can't .
the next thing you know it's going to be ...
like , 1990 , and 2000 .
can you imagine?
good bye 1979 ...
hello 1980 .
make sure you snort it back real quick and hard .
like this .
it burns .
it's good though , right?
it's going in my throat .
that's the drip .
the drip's the best part .
it tastes like aspirin .
do one more in the other nostril .
i need a drink of water .
one more and then a drink of water .
do you think i look cool when i do it?
so let's talk about the future .
let's talk about what video means to this industry .
let's talk about how all of us , not one of us , how all of us will profit .
now , i've been doing theater in san francisco and san diego ...
as long as you've been doing stag and hardcore .
we're all familiar with your biography , floyd .
no one is doubting your credentials or your history .
then why the resistance?
this industry will be turned upside down soon enough .
why help it?
why not be prepared?
colonel's got money .
you got talent .
i got the equipment and distribution .
not to mention those kids out there ... who are hot fuck action to the max , jack .
this is the future .
videotape tells the truth .
you come into my house , my party , to tell me about the future?
and the future is tape , videotape , and not film?
that it's amateurs , not professionals?
i'm a filmmaker .
that's why i'll never make a movie on videotape .
i'll tell you something .
i will never loan out any of the actors under contract to me .
period .
wait a minute , jack .
i'm not a complicated man .
i like cinema .
in particular , i like to see people fucking on film .
but i don't want to win an oscar or re invent the wheel .
i like simple pleasures like butter in my ass and lollipops in my mouth .
that's something i enjoy .
call me crazy , call me a pervert .
but there is one thing that i want to do in this life .
and that is , i want to make a dollar and a cent in this business .
i'm not trying to hurt you .
i'm trying to help you stay ahead of the game .
we're going in circles now .
we're in familiar territory .
the territory we're in is the future .
not to mention the cost .
you know , if it looks like shit , and it sounds like shit , then it must be shit !
you're holding on too tight , jack .
it doesn't have to look good .
film is just too damn expensive .
and theaters are already converting to video projectors .
i haven't heard that .
well , it's true .
ten minutes before the new year .
i'd like to spend it with my friends .
we will or will not continue this conversation .
hey , scotty .
what's up?
fucking new year's , right?
1980 .
oh , man !
right !
did you see my new car?
got a new car?
want to see?
all right .
cool .
it's out front .
come on .
i want you to meet my friend todd .
todd parker , dirk diggler .
what's up , man?
how are you?
we finally meet .
i was telling you about him before .
you remember?
todd parker?
he works at party boys strip club?
cool .
you're a dancer .
yeah , i got some moves .
you coming or you want to talk to these guys?
i'll be around in a little bit and we can talk then , okay?
see you later , reed .
when you get my the lights , close your eyes .
just follow my voice .
here , here , here , here , here .
it's cool !
you want to get inside?
when did you get it?
yesterday .
i had it painted yesterday , so the paint might be kind of sticky .
this is great , man !
you want to go for a ride?
wait , wait !
fuck !
hell , how much time is left?
i'm sorry .
what the hell is the matter with you?
why did you do that , scotty?
you look at me sometimes .
i want to know if you like me .
yeah , i like you , scotty .
can i kiss you?
please , can i kiss you on the mouth?
please let me?
look , i'm really sorry .
i didn't mean to grab you like that or scare you .
do you want to kiss me?
what's the matter with you?
forget it .
i'm really drunk .
really , i am .
i'm out of my head .
i'm really wasted .
really , dirk .
i'm really just wasted .
i'm crazy right now .
i'm really crazy .
do you want to go back inside?
do you like my car , dirk?
what?
because i wanted to , you know ...
i wanted to make sure you thought it was cool or else i'd take it back .
it's great .
happy new year .
happy new year , scotty .
i really love you .
i love you too , scotty .
let's go back inside , okay?
idiot !
i'm a fucking idiot .
i'm a fucking idiot .
two minutes , pops !
let's go !
let's go !
two minutes !
come on , little bill !
little bill , smile , man !
little bill , champagne?
thanks .
that's nice of you .
happy new year .
to you too .
kurt , have you seen my wife?
they're doing the countdown thing .
come on in , man .
hey , little bill , look at me .
10 ... 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... 6, 5, 4 ... 3 ... 2 ...
what the fuck was that?
where's jack?
what about your character , " brock landers "?
and what people may consider violent attitudes towards women?
violence?
no !
i mean , if there's a certain amount of ... violence or action in this series of film , that's the movie .
if brock landers is slick with a gun ... he does so in the vein of good .
brock protects the values of the american ideal , and fights for causes that instill pride in a society where morals are hard to come by .
who sent you?
get the fuck off me , asshole .
lie still or i'll punch you in the face !
fuck off ! .
i'll find out who sent you .
amber , i live in this world .
i don't like violence any more than you do .
violence is a bad thing .
but when you see violence in films ...
if movies , films , caused violence ... we'd be able to wipe out violence tomorrow .
no more films .
that's fine .
i'll do something else .
i'll fuck on my own time .
you know , i got other interests .
i'm a magician .
hopefully , that will be something ...
i focus on in the future .
you can't fuck forever .
i realize that .
violence ... is something that plagues us as a society .
well , the fine line is , i'm playing a character .
i mean , i'm dirk diggler .
brock landers is a character that i'm playing .
i'll ask you again , and i'll ask nice .
where the fuck is ringo , you bitch?
fuck you .
why do i love him?
he's very special .
he can fuck hard or he can fuck really gently .
he's the best .
i think that's ... part of my reason for doing this .
i've gotten thousands upon thousands of letters ... from people telling me , " god , you've taught me this and ... you've made our love life so much better .
this isn't " go out and have sex with ten million people .
how to get a girl off . " it's how to get your wife off .
if only people could have been doing this before , we could have saved a million relationships .
i've saved thousands .
blocking an idea or movement .
jack'll put the final touches together for what the camera needs for editing .
but he allows me to block my own sex scenes and gives me the freedom to develop the character and stuff like that .
i don't know any other director who would let an actor ... do that .
i don't allow him to block his own sex scenes .
it is .
it's jealousy ... it's deceitfulness , it's vindictiveness .
but , god , what can you expect when you're on top .
it's like napoleon , when he was the king ... people were constantly trying to conquer him ... in the roman empire .
it's history repeating itself all over again .
to all the critics out there , i know they'll be reviewing this .
i know they'll try to knock me .
i want them to know can i say this into the camera?
sure .
i only am who i am because i was born that way .
i have a gift ... and i am trying to not be selfish about it , but to use it .
and if you want to knock me for that , it's your own problem .
jealousy will get you nowhere .
i'm going to keep rocking on .
for dirk diggler , the future is something to look forward to , not to fear .
film , poetry , karate , music and dance .
he is a man of passion and mystery .
he is a man of lust .
it's my poem to you .
it's really good .
you're like a director now .
have you shown jack yet?
no .
i wanted you to be the first .
it's really good , amber .
congratulations .
thanks , baby .
you might want to think about cutting the part where jack talks about ...
about blocking the sex?
that stuff about me not being a black belt is not true .
yeah , i can fix that .
how'd it turn out?
what?
slow down .
guys , guys , guys !
slow down , colonel .
say again?
i'll be right there ...
so ...?
let me tell you , jack .
i don't mean to laugh about it , but she was ... 15 going on 150 .
believe me .
i mean , she was ... you would never know it .
never know .
i was fooled completely .
i mean , i've had a few of them .
anyhow ...
you do believe me , don't you?
yeah , i believe you .
anyway , so i take her home ... and i got her there and ...
i tell her not to do so much coke .
she must've done 20 lines in 5 minutes !
it's like a vacuum in her nose .
just going up like crazy .
anyway , she's got all this stuff going on .
next thing you know , she stopped .
something must have broken up there because blood poured everywhere .
pouring out .
you thought she was older ...
you didn't do anything ...
she was just at the ...
she was at your place .
you didn't do anything , right?
right .
nothing .
you didn't do anything?
not a thing .
you know me , jack .
you didn't do anything?
no , i didn't do anything .
but they ... foud something at the house .
what?
there's something that's ...
jack , it's my fucking weakness .
they're so small and they're so cute , and they're so adorable .
i just can't help it when they're so cute and adorable .
jack , listen .
i don't touch them , jack .
not in any way .
honestly .
jack , please !
now you think i'm an asshole .
jack , let me tell you this .
i love you , jack .
i'm your friend .
there's one thing i want you to do , though .
jack , come on .
tell me that you'd be my friend .
just tell me , am i your friend?
jack , am i your friend?
i do .
i do too .
i now pronounce you man and wife .
i'm dying to do a movie with you .
i know you are .
it's such an important thing in my life .
i spoke to jack .
you know , i spoke to him , but ...
i tell you what comes to my mind .
what comes to mind is , i am the ultimate latin lover .
there's no latin lover like me .
once you get maurice as the latin lover ...
that's so great , you guys !
it's a chance for me to run the store my way .
get them off my back .
we're getting a house .
exactly !
i'm going to run the store my way .
are you moving to bakersfield?
soon?
aren't you folks from bakersfield?
you guys , we're losing these two !
they're moving to bakersfield .
big promotion .
you look at the movies and say , " hell , i can do that .
i can do it .
it's a little more complicated than that .
it's a tough racket .
dirk !
you made it .
how you doing?
good .
who's that?
hi .
i'm johnny doe .
you're dirk diggler?
it's great to meet you .
johnny's the new boy on the street .
he's interested in show business .
he's very tired .
he's shy , you know?
so , i can tell you it's a tough business .
you got a great kisser .
there's a lot of work involved .
a lot of people .
we all have to work our buns off .
you know what i mean?
i mean , it takes 15 , 16 guys just to ... do the lighting .
this crystal , man , you just want to do bumps .
shut up , man .
hey , you guys .
what?
just saying , " hey .
yeah , whatever .
you all right?
it's getting me fucking high .
it's that carpet dope .
it's the kind of dope they used to put carpet in .
they'd mix it up in the bathtub .
while they're mixing it they'd drop in a hunk of carpet into it .
it's a lot better than that pink shit .
that pink shit's weird .
they put fish scales in that shit .
fuck .
you look good .
you're ready .
you're ready !
come on .
you ready?
i'm born ready .

i'm not going to shoot you in the state you're in .
what do you mean " state "?
state of california?
i know where i am .
you've been up for two days .
i haven't been up for two days !
nevertheless , you look like you haven't been to sleep .
i ain't going to shoot you this way because you don't look good .

dirk diggler demo .
you got the touch . " take 7 .
excuse me , reed .
you got the touch .
you got the power .
after all is said and done ,
you never walk , you never run .
you're a winner .
you've got the moves you know the streets .
break the rules take the heat .
you're nobody's fool .
you're at your best when the going gets rough .
you've been put to the test but it's never enough .
you got the touch .
think the bass is taking away from the vocal?
no , not really .
maybe .
it sounds balanced to me .
it's taking away from my vocal .
take the bass down and bring up the vocal .
let's do it , nick .
you heard him .
want to take it from the top?
yeah , let's try it .
i think we should repeat that again .
it's definitely cool .
let's lay it down .
want to lay it down?
were we rolling on that rehearsal?
is he going to fuck me in the ass?
is that what you want?
it would be nice .
fuck her in the ass .
lock and load .
jack .
i was going to take a pottery class at everywoman's village ..
i want to do that .
we'll do that .
mondays , wednesdays , and fridays at three .
i was thinking something .
i was going to see about taking the ged .
do you know what that is?
for high school .
to graduate .
i never got my diploma .
i feel bed .
i think you were right about that .
you should do it , rollergirl .
because you know what?
if you wanted to , you could do anything .
have your loan application?
yes , i do .
good .
do you want to follow me?
are we going to have any other coverage on this?
we just keep shooting .
this is video .
we shoot and shoot , then we deal with it later .
now , summer , i want you to take sky's thong off .
that thong thing .
yeah , actually take it off .
and finger it .
no , that's good .
lick the thong .
that's really good technically ... but it lacks passion .
i want to see some passion here .
yes , bitch !
yeah , that's it .
lick my balls .
fuck me !
who's your daddy , bitch?
you'll live .
i'm back !
perfect timing .
what the fuck took you so long , man?
that's what buck's super stereo world is all about : the customer .
because people want to know what they're getting into technically .
i have the hi fi background to answer any technical question they have .
i've been in sound equipment long enough ... to know what a guy wants when he walks in .
that's the personal touch that
buck's super stereo world will have .
i miss my two sons , you know?
i miss my little andrew ... and my dirk .
i always felt like dirk was ... my baby .
my new baby .
don't you miss dirk?
he's so fucking talented , the bastard .
i love him , rollergirl .
i really love the stupid jerk .
i love you , mom .
i want you to be my mom , amber .
are you my mom?
i'll just ask you if you're my mom , okay?
and you say " yes , " okay?
are you my mom?
yes , honey , i am .
hold on .
now , look .
come on .
all right?
all we need is the tapes , burt .
no , you don't get them until you pay .
in our situation that doesn't make any fucking sense !
we can't pay the price of the demo tapes unless we take the demo tapes to the record company and get paid !
exactly !
that's not an m. p. , that's a y. p. your problem !
come up with the money and i'll give you the tapes .
you're talking above my head .
i don't know this industry jargon .
y. p. , m. p. , whatever .
okay?
all i know is that i cannot get a record contract .
we cannot get a contract ... unless i take these tapes .
and granted , the tapes themselves are yours .
you own them , okay?
but the magic that is on the tapes ... that heart and soul we put into those tapes , that is ours .
and you don't own that .
now , i need to take that magic and get it to the record company !
they're waiting .
we were supposed to be there half an hour ago .
we look like assholes right now , man !
i don't want to do this anymore .
i can't .
let's have fun now .
let's just go and go .
because it's over .
there's too many things .
too many things .
too many things .
let's go walk .
i don't want to leave this room .
me either !
i love you , honey .
i love you , mom .
let me explain to him ... in simple arithmetic .
one , two , three .
because you don't fucking get it , burt !
you give us the tapes , we get the record contract ... we come and give you your money .
have you heard the tapes?
we're guaranteed a record deal .
our stuff is that good .
we sculptured .
now , i understand .
i know you want it to happen .
but it's not going to happen .
because it's a " catch 22 " and that's it .
what does that mean?
what is a " catch 22 "?
catch 22 , " gentlemen .
think about it .
you know what i'm thinking about?
i'm thinking about kicking some fucking ass in here , man !
scotty , get him out of here !
thanks a lot of backing us up too .
real good .
fuck !
we can't help you .
i have all the papers , though .
i mean ... everything's in order?
yes?
yes .
but we can't give you a loan .
i'm sorry .
i don't understand .
why can't you give me the loan?
mr. swope , you're a pornographer .
the banks is not in business to support pornography .
i'm not a pornographer , though .
i'm an actor .
i'm sorry .
look , this is a new business for me .
all right?
it's a real thing that i want to do .
it's a real thing that i can do .
please !
i'm sorry .
we did everything right .
it's okay .
just wait a minute .
let's just take a minute , okay?
look , you have something to say .
i have something to say .
all right?
so let's just talk .
if there is something that i didn't fill out correctly on this ... or something that i left out , or that you want me to write on there just tell me what to write on there .
i'm sorry .
you're not being fair !
this isn't fair .
this financial institution cannot endorse pornography .
stop saying that !
quit saying " pornography " !
why are you doing this?
i'm an actor !
i'm sorry .
i am an actor !
who's your daddy?
how is it?
what it is , what it is .
suck that cock , bitch .
so , you must be maggie?
kathleen o'malley .
i'm the judge .
you have a lawyer with you?
no , i don't .
hello , judge .
good morning , counselor .
you've been divorced for 6 years?
since 1977 .
and the agreement on the money settlement has been taken care of? .
yes .
what we're talking about , then , is coming to an agreement on the custody ... of andrew .
what was decided on during the divorce?
well , initially , andrew was to go with his father ... for visitation , with his mother ... from saturday noon to sunday at seven .
with his mother entitled to bring andrew to her house ... or any reasonable place .
was that the understanding?
why wasn't that visiting privilege honored , then?
it was .
for a while .
i only saw him twice .
it said , " reasonable place .
i don't think that a house of drugs , prostitution and pornography was that .
i'm sorry?
my wife is in the pornography business .
i didn't think that environment was safe for my son .
no , this is not right .
my son was never exposed to pornographic material , drugs or any of those things .
my husband just assumed ...
i saw it with my own eye , maggie .
did you register a complaint?
my client didn't officially register , your honor .
but i think the circumstances call for immediate action ... for the safety of the child .
the problem judge , is that my ex wife ...
she's a sick person , and she needs help .
she deals in sex and drugs for a living .
no , i don't do drugs .
your honor , she has been in and out of trouble with the law ... on several occasions for this sort of thing .
no , not anymore .
no .
have you ever been arrested?
yes .
when was the last time you were arrested ... and what was the charge?
okay , let's get ready for this experiment .
hi , jack horner here .
i'm in the back seat of this beautiful limousine , riding along west on sherman way .
and beside me ... is a beautiful , talented , gorgeous young actress ... from adult cinema , miss rollergirl .

on the lookout for a young stud ... who , maybe , will get in the back seat here ... and get it on with rollergirl .
and we're going to make film history ... right here on videotape .
