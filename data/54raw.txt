black jacket?

lsn't it hot for a long leather coat?
yeah , a little .
yeah .
look at his partner .
they just came in .
something's getting ready to go down .
go and cover that guy .
what's going on?
i'll check out this asshole at the bar .
billy will make sure i behave .
will somebody tell me what's going on?
no bullshit this time .
just sit tight , billy .
philip !

he said you don't come here no more , but i said , " it's phil " .
get out of here , man .
i told you !
give me a kiss , baby .
i said get outta here !
everybody freeze !
turn around .
turn around !
phil !
keep your hands on the table !
what's wrong?
what's all the hostility?

what's all this gun , man?
you changed .
get back or i'll blow your brains out .
police .
move and i'll kill you .
don't move !
turn over !
way to go , rosewood .
you're some cop .
you know that?
sorry for the disturbance , folks .
everything's under control .
taggart .
would you explain why you and rosewood were in a strip bar out of our jurisdiction while you were on duty?
before you chastise these officers , there's something you should know .
the only reason they were at a strip bar is because they were tailing me .
they were outside wondering what i was doing .
i was in having a good time .
i'm into those things .
these guys waited outside and the only reason they came in was because they saw two men with bulges in their jackets going in .
well , these guys were going to commit a robbery .
they watched them , waited for them to make their move , then foiled a crime .
i did not know what was going on .
i'm freaked out .
they must have a sixth sense .
i don't know what you teach them , but they're not just regular cops .
they're supercops .
the only thing missing on these guys are capes .
ls this what really happened?
no , sir .
would someone tell me what happened?
well ...
foley invited us to this bar .
we accepted .
we ordered club sodas , sir .
right .
and while we were there ,
foley observed the two suspects casing the establishment .
and before we knew what was going on , he'd already disarmed one of them .
detective foley deserves all the credit for the arrests , sir .
detective foley , we appreciate your assistance , but if you want to practise law enforcement ,
i would prefer you did it in detroit .
i understand .
i'm sorry .
but before i go i want you two to know , the supercops story was working .
ok?
it was working and you guys just messed it up .
i'm trying to figure you guys out , but i haven't yet .
but it's cool .
just fuck up a perfectly good lie and it's all right .
you guys are off the case .
foster , mccabe , your turn .
don't lose him .
not a chance , sir .
and you two ...
ln my office .
morning , gentlemen .
coffee and doughnuts?
what?
coffee and doughnuts .
there he is .
morning , officers .
you the second team?
we're the first team .
we won't fall for a banana in the tailpipe .
you won't fall for the banana in the tailpipe?
it should be more natural , brother , like this .
i ain't falling for no banana in my tailpipe . " it's more natural for us .
you've been hanging out with this dude too long .
i'm sorry , i'm just fucking with you .
that's funny to me .
you gonna try to keep up with me?
no problem .
lsn't this victor maitland's house?
yeah , i think so .
i've seen enough .
you want something to drink?
i got some stuff in the trunk .
excuse me .
for a man on vacation , you look like you're on a stakeout .
stakeout?
no , no .
i'm picnicking .
this is a picnic area .
i've been shooting the shit long enough .
time for me to take in some sights .
excuse me .
what the hell's he doing?
can you put this in a good spot?
this shit happened last time i parked here .
may i help you?
i'm looking for victor maitland .
you realise that this is a members only club?
i have to talk to victor .
it's very important .
victor maitland , are you sure?
yes .
grey haired gentleman .
very dark skin .
capricorn .
why don't you give me the message and i'll take it to him?
ok .
tell victor that ramon , the fella he met about a week ago ...
tell him that ramon went to the clinic , and i found out that i have ... herpes simplex 10 .
i think victor should check himself out with his physician before things start falling off on the man .
perhaps you better tell him that .
i think that would be best .
so do l .
hi , victor .
i'm back .
look , guys , don't even try it .
why don't you get the hell out of here?
get the fuck away from me , man .
very good , victor .
could you teach him to roll over and sit , too?
what do you want?
i wanna talk to you .
last time , i didn't get the chance .
i've nothing to say to you .
that's cool , i'll do all the talking .
this is a very nice place , vic .
hi .
i like this .
this is nice .
glad you like it .
i must make you a member .
victor , i know that you're into a lot of crooked shit .
and i have a pretty good idea that you had mikey killed .
and when i find out for sure ,
i'm going to fuck you up real bad .
ls that so?
now listen to me , my tough little friend .
i don't know from under what stone you crawled or where you get these ridiculous ideas about me , but it seems painfully obvious you haven't the slightest fucking idea who you're dealing with .
now , my advice to you is crawl back to your little stone in detroit before you get squashed , ok?
please step away from the table .
gotta go now , vic .
nice meeting you again .
yeah .
catch you later , vic .
i can't wait .
don't i know you guys?
you look so familiar .
detective foley , this is becoming very irritating .
why are you bothering victor maitland?
i had a friend , michael tandino , who used to work for him .
maitland had him killed .
when i can prove it you'll be the first to know .
forget what you can prove , talk to me .
ok .
listen .
everybody knows victor maitland is a hotshot art dealer .
but i poked around .
art's not the only thing he deals .
i saw some guys in his warehouse unloading a crate of german bearer bonds .
michael tandino had bonds like this on him , coincidentally , when he was killed .
just because maitland invests in the same bonds doesn't mean he's a killer .
the man's not an investor , he's a smuggler , be it bonds , drugs or whatever .
the crate i saw didn't even pass through customs .
maitland is paying to get his shipments out before they're inspected .
when his guys get it , they take the drugs or bonds out of the crates and they send it back before customs even knows what's going on .
and you witnessed this?
everything except for the drugs .
but i found coffee grounds everywhere .
coffee grounds?
what does that mean?
drugs are packed in coffee .
the scent throws off the dogs .
very good .
now what do we do?
look , detective foley , i ...
i'm sorry .
i'd really like to help you .
lf you'd found the drugs , that's one thing , but if your only evidence is coffee , we can't get a search warrant .
we can get around that .
we don't " get around " search warrants .
taggart , i want you to start checking this out .
start with the lapd , the fbl and the customs service .
wait a minute .
maitland is much smarter than that .
we snoop around , he'll close down and get his shipments from elsewhere .
really? ls that what your extensive experience tells you?
i haven't been on the force ...
shit .
ls this the man?
yes , sir .
the gentleman that crashed through victor maitland's window?
who disabled an unmarked unit with a banana?
yes , sir .
who lured taggart and rosemont into a gross dereliction of duty at a striptease establishment?
it's rosewood , sir .
yes , sir .
ls this the gentleman who ruined the buffet at the harrow club today?
yes , sir .
i just bet you are the pride of your department in detroit .
lieutenant , i'd like to see you in your office .
yes , sir .
ls this the man who wrecked the buffet at the harrow club today?
lower your voice .
can he hear me through the wall?
yes , he can .
rosewood , take detective foley back to his hotel room , watch him pack , and escort him to the city limits .
then you can give him his gun back .
the two charges of disturbing the peace have been dropped against you .
but if you return to beverly hills , the charges will be reinstated and you will be prosecuted to the limit of the law .
sir , may i say something?
what?
he seems to have enough ...
you want to tell that to the chief?
no , sir .
then i suggest you get moving .
come on , axel .
right .
let me check on that tomorrow and get back to you .
thank you .
hi .
victor , hi .
sit down .
i'm not interrupting?
of course not .
there's a gentleman in town from detroit who says he's a friend of michael tandino .
he came by the office yesterday and asked me all sorts of odd questions .
excuse me , darling .
i believe his name is foley .
since you were a friend of michael ,
i was wondering if you knew the fellow .
we grew up in the same neighbourhood .
really?
have you seen him lately?
he came in yesterday .
what?
he came by here?
and?
he told me that mikey had been killed .
yes .
yes , i know .
and then?
that's it .
he left and i haven't seen him since .
jenny , darling , do you know where he's staying?
i have some information which might be helpful for him .
no , i have no idea .
i hope i didn't disturb you .
no problem .
we'll have dinner soon , yes?
that'd be lovely .
take care .
i read the manifests .
they're expecting another shipment in today .
bogomil ...
this is a chance for me and you to blow this case wide open .
i wish i could , but i can't .
why?
because bogomil would kill me .
i'm not going to drive you to the art gallery .
it's easy .
jenny will let us in maitland's warehouse .
the shipment arrives , we nail them .
how can you be sure it'll be drugs?
i got a hunch .
a technique by which many crimes outside beverly hills get solved .
why didn't you tell bogomil about this shipment?
he does everything by the book .
ls everybody in this town a robot?
this thing is very personal to me .
all he asked me to do was drive you out of town .
now i'm going to screw that up , too .
billy , i love you .
i just fell in love with you .
jenny , how are you?
this is my buddy billy rosewood .
jenny summers .
billy's a beverly hills cop .
how do you do?
that's serge .
can you get my friend an espresso?
you want it with a lemon twist?
sure , if it's no bother .
no , don't be stupid .
victor maitland was here asking questions about you today .
he was acting real weird .
look , i want to get back inside the warehouse .
how about i go with you?
you work in a gallery .
you're not a cop .
lf this has to do with mikey's death , i want to check it out .
i don't have time to argue with you .
let me get my keys and we'll argue on the way .
billy , you sit here and observe .
don't move till i get you .
why can't i come in?
cos you're a cop in this town .
without probable cause , it's an illegal search .
didn't they teach you that in cop school?
i find some evidence , i'll get you .
you can't ...
be cool , all right? lf anything jumps off , i'll come and get you .
ls there any chance you'll let me go in by myself?
no chance .
fuck .
come on .
seems they've been already .
what are you looking for?
this .
a crate from overseas that hasn't passed through customs yet .
what is that?
coffee?
yeah , it's coffee on top .
but this ain't sugar .
go get rosewood .
welcome to the party .
it seems we have guests .
how nice .
i do like surprises .
jeannette .
i just can't tell you how disappointed i am to find you here .
shut up !
i don't want to hear it .
take her to the car and wait for me .
what are you going to do with him?
you should be more worried about what we're going to do with you .
don't worry .
we've got cocaine and coffee , we're going to have a party .
thanks for having me over , vic .
this is very nice .
did you say something?
lf something happens to her ...
i'm all ears .
i'll kill you .
really?
that would be a neat trick .
well , cuz .
are you still pissed at me?
no .
but i should have taken care of you in detroit .
when i popped your little buddy .
goodbye , mr foley .
have a nice day .
i'll try .
damn it .
oh , boy .
how's that little bump on the head i gave you in detroit?
healed up nice , i hope .
freeze !
thanks .
tell taggart to check out the warehouse .
i'll explain later .
sergeant taggart is here , he wants to talk to you .
shit !
billy , what the hell is going on?
sorry , sarge , i can't talk now .
what do you mean?
just check out the warehouse and please don't say anything to bogomil .
he's not transmitting any more .
shit .
what's the matter?
billy's doing something dumb again .
was he calling from the hotel?
no , sir .
right now , his car's heading north on palm canyon road .
we were there this morning .
what?
foley was looking over maitland's house .
do you have that warehouse address?
yes , sir .
check that place out , let me know what's going on over there .
don't talk to anybody but me .
hold it , foley .
you're under arrest .
billy , why are you here?
i forced him at gunpoint .
no , he didn't .
everything he said about maitland is right .
he's kidnapped a woman .
let's get her .
what do you think i'm doing?
we'll have a warrant in 20 minutes .
she could be dead in 20 minutes .
stop .
you're coming with us .
i'm going inside .
you want to stop me , shoot me .
me , too .
you can do what you want , but i'm going in .
this is really serious trouble .
lf you're lucky , you'll just get fired .
got it .
this is my last warning .
i'm sorry , sarge .
i've got to .
shit .
wait a minute .
what's that?
looks like east gate .
punch it up .
who the hell is that?
better get maitland up here .
where is everybody? ls rosewood back?
no , sir .

he took off about 10 minutes ago .
foley's on the grounds .
how the hell should i know?
get some people out there right away .

come on .
they must be away from the car .
i can see that .
keep trying .

what's this man doing here?
bleeding , sir .
how come he isn't wearing cuffs?
well , he isn't actually in custody , sir .
place him in custody .
or would you like me to?
wouldn't you like to hear my report first , sir?
you have a report that explains all this?
yes , sir .
well , i will be very glad to hear it .
miss jeannette summers , the manager of mr maitland's art gallery , accidentally discovered what she suspected was cocaine in the gallery's warehouse .
she immediately communicated her discovery to detective axel foley .
detective foley was , at the time , cooperating in a joint beverly hills detroit investigation .
detectives foley and rosewood proceeded to the warehouse where rosewood discovered approximately 80 kilos of cocaine .
rosewood called for back up and i despatched our officers .
sergeant taggart was the first on the scene .
believing a felony was in progress , sergeant taggart joined rosewood , with detective foley present only as an observer , and proceeded to enter the grounds .
ln defending ourselves , we shot several suspects , including mr maitland .
you expect me to believe that report?
that's the report i'm filing , sir .
sergeant taggart , why don't you tell me what happened?
happened just like the lieutenant said , chief .
well , i suppose congratulations are in order .
thank you , sir .
that report better be on my desk in the morning .
yes , sir .
first thing .
you were lying your ass off .
go to the hospital and get your shoulder looked at .
excuse me , sir .
could you do me a favour , sir?
your favours are all used up .
i understand .
i just hoped you could call lnspector todd and straighten things out for me , but that's all right .
i'm out of a job .
it's cool .
i think i'll stay in beverly hills .
i'm going to start a private investigation company .
i'll talk to todd first thing .
really?
you bet .
thank you so much .
hi , i'm axel foley checking out of suite 1035 .
one moment , sir .
i'll get your bill .
guys , you didn't have to come to see me off , but i'm very moved .
bogomil ordered us to make sure you got out of town .
that doesn't matter .
what matters is that you came down here .
i'm all choked up .
i've got a lump in my throat .
look a little misty yourself , taggart .
there you go , sir .
thank you .
excuse me , the beverly hills police department is picking that up .
get outta here .
guys , that's the last straw .
you guys are too nice .
do you sell those beverly palm robes?
yes , sir . $95 apiece .
put them on my tab .
i have to have two of them , though .
billy , you saved my life .
i'll never be able to repay you , but as a token of my appreciation ,
i want you to have this fine beverly palm robe .
each time you get in the shower , think about our friendship .
think about axel foley .
i love you , billy .
thanks , axel .
here , let me take this .
you should rest that arm .
billy , take care of the tab .
taggart ...
here you are , sir .
this is for you .
no , that's all right .
you keep it as a souvenir .
i already have three of them in my bag .
thank you , sir .
not going to say goodbye?
aren't you tailing me to the city limits?
yes , we are .
i figured you would .
i was thinking about stopping for a drink .
we figured you would .
then will you join me?
i don't think so , axel .
we're still on duty .
i don't think one beer's going to kill us , billy .
right .
listen to taggart .
lighten up .
one drink's not going to kill us .
but guys , if you fall too far behind , don't be afraid to honk , ok?
where we going , anyway?
don't worry , just follow my lead .
i know the perfect place .
you guys'll love it .
trust me .
