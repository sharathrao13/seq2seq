noah and allie gave a remarkably convincing portrayal of a boy and a girl traveling down a very long road with no regard for the consequences .
they fell in love , didn't they?
yes , they did .
good .
i like this kind of story .
go on .
after that night ,
allie and noah spent every waking hour together .
and soon they were inseparable .
noah , come on .
your boat cannot beat me there .
that's really nice .
mmm , mmm , mmm ...
beautiful dripping fragments .
the negligent list of one after another , as i happen to call them to me .
or drink to them .
the real poems , what we call poems , being merely pictures .
the poems of the privacy of the night .
and of men like me .
this poem , drooping shy and unseen , that i always carry .
and that all men carry .
not bad for whitman .
hey , look , we got a visitor .
i'm sorry , i didn't mean to interrupt .
well , don't apologize , come on up here , darling .

i didn't know that .
god .
i stammered .
stammered , stutter , what's the difference?
couldn't understand a damn thing he said .
so , i got him to read me poetry out loud .
it wasn't very pretty at first , but then his stutter went away .
well , it's a good idea , that poetry .
yeah , i thought so .
huh?
unbelievable , unbelievable .
i'm a tennyson man , myself , but he likes whitman ...
for some reason , i don't know .

they didn't agree on much .
in fact , they rarely agreed on everything .
they fought all the time .

and they challenged each other every day .
but despite their differences , they had one important thing in common .
they were crazy about each other .

look , he understands .
but ...
it's hard , but he really does .
summer's over and it's time to go home .
if he wants to talk to you , he'll write .
if not?
okay .
okay , can you just ... can you just tell him that i love him , then?
can you do that?
i'll tell him .
thank you .
bye , fin .
she's gone .
summer romances end for all kinds of reasons .
they are shooting stars ... a spectacular moment of light in the heavens , a fleeting glimpse of eternity .
and in a flash , they're gone .
noah was desperate .
he wrote to allie that he was sorry and stupid for breaking up with her .
he wrote to tell her that he still loved her , and he wanted to see her .
and that if she would write back , he would come to wherever she was .
he wrote one letter a day for a year ... 365 letters , but they all went unanswered .
hey fred !
nothing?
sorry .
all right , thank you .
finally , after a year of silence , he decided to put it all behind him and start a new life .
so he wrote a farewell letter
and he and fin packed their bags and headed for atlanta .
noah !
noah !
noah !
come on , listen to this !
a state of war has existed between the united states and the ...
the constitution of the united states , against all enemies , foreign and domestic .
noah and fin enlisted together .
and after two years of chasing rommel through the north african desert , they were deployed to patton's third army in europe .
go !
fin !
do i contradict myself?
very well then , i contradict myself .
allie was in her third year of college when she volunteered as a nurse's aid .
to her , the broken men with shattered bodies , who filled the ward were all noah .
or someone who fought beside him in the jungle or frozen snow swept road .
i'm gonna lift you up .
ready?
there we go .
now , i'm gonna bring this leg over .
set it on the stool .
all right .
you okay?
yeah .
miss , can i ask you a question?
hmm?
i noticed that you aren't wearing a ring .
and i was wondering if i could take you out .
excuse me?
on a date .
now , before you go and say no ,
i'll have you know that i am an excellent dancer and my intentions are completely dishonorable .
okay , okay " casanova , " come on .
let's just get you better , then we'll talk about a date , okay?
would you get a load of him?
oh my gosh , he is dreamy .
what is he doing here?
mmm .
he's staring at you .
oh , miss?
i'm all better .
now , how's about that date?
allie was surprised how quickly she fell in love with lon hammond .
he was handsome , smart , funny , sophisticated and charming .
hey !
he also came from old southern money , and was fabulously wealthy .
what?
# hya ! #
oh , what's happening?
where you going?
where they going?
see you later , sweetheart .
oh dear , look at that .
allie , i've been thinking a lot about why we shouldn't get married .
okay , i give up , why shouldn't we get married?
well see , that's the thing , i couldn't think of anything at first .
an then , it just dawned on me .
your parents ...
my parents?
absolutely .
your old mom and dad .
thank you for that .
mom?
you see , the problem is that they love me .
i'm exactly the type of man they do .
they want you to end up with .
really?
you know , i'm wealthy , i'm from the south , i got a decent job .
you know , i'm an incredible dancer , i'm a really smart guy .
you look great .
i like to think ...
so what's the problem , huh?
now just this , if you marry me ...
mm hmm .
now listen close .
if you marry me ...
mm hmm .
then you will have lost a life long battle of defiance against them .
oh my goodness , what are we going to do?
i do not know .
huh !
hey , band , you feeling all right?
# hey , band , you feeling all right? ! #
# ooh bop sha bam , shi bimmy bop #
# oh bop sha bam , shi bimmy bop # you say it ! # ally ally ally ooh # # ally ally ally ooh #
# olly olly olly ooh # # olly olly olly ooh #
# whooly ooh # # whooly ooh #
# whooly ooh # # whooly ooh #
see allie , i think ... damn it , i think you have to marry me .
i think you need to marry me .
i do?
yes you do .
i do , why?
because if you do , you parents will always know the unhappiness that you feel for not being able to disappoint them .
i think you may have overlooked one minor detail .
and what's that?
well , you see you have to get their permission first .
and i think you may have overestimated their affection for you .
is that right?
mm hmm .
oh , i don't think so .
then why not?
oh , 'cause i asked them already and they said yes .
what?
one more thing .
i love you .
will you marry me , honey?
i know i kid around a lot , but i'm crazy about you .
marry me?
make me the happiest man in the world .
yes .
yes !
just hold tight .
where are you going?
oh my god .
mama .
okay , stop the band .
excuse me .
i'd like everyone here to know that this young lady and i are getting married .
she agreed with all her heart , but couldn't understand why at the very moment she said yes ,
noah's face came to her mind .
hey , noah , yeah !
oh , good to see you .
let me see you .
you bleeding anywhere?
no?
everything good?
yeah .
oh , i love you .
come on , there's something i got to show you .
come on .
all right .
what's going on?
what is this?
here .
i sold the house .
you sold the house?
yup .
gotta be out by the end of the month .
between that and your gi bill , you ought to be able to get it now .
get what?
your dream house .
the windsor plantation .
dad ...
now , don't dad me , i don't want to hear about it .
i already talked to the bank , they're gonna give you the loan .
well , i can't let you sell your house .
it's done .
it's a good thing .
you should do it .
wait a second .
you sell the house , where are you gonna live?
with you , dummy , what do you think?
somebody's got to help you fix it up .
noah took a look at the house , but only saw one thing ...
allie .
he decided right there to fulfill his life long dream .
he would rebuild the old house from the ground up .
and when noah went to charleston to get the building plans approved , fate stepped in and dealt him a sweet card .
stop the bus !
stop the bus .
sorry , mac , i can't stop the bus until i get to the depot .
no , no , no , please stop the bus now .
please !
do you understand english , pal?
no one gets off till we get to the depot .
now sit down .
god .
hey !
watch it , screwball !
what are you doing?
hey !
how old is your daughter now?
well , you mind .
he's right over there .
baby , hello .
oh !
hold it .
oh , come with it .
after seeing allie that day , something inside noah snapped .
he got the notion into his head that if he restored the old house where they had come that night ,
allie would find a way to come back to him .
some called it a labor of love .
others called it something else .
but in fact , noah had gone a little mad .
excuse me .
would ...
it's time to eat .
lunch will be served in the sun room today .
the melon is good .
i had a bite .
did they ever see each other again?
noah and allie?
now you don't want me to spoil the end of the story before i get to the good part , do you?
where did i leave off?
i shall not want .
when noah's father died in november , the house was all he had .
he leadeth me down ...
in time , noah finished the house .
okay , smile .
here we go .
he took a good look at what he had accomplished , got rip roaring drunk for 10 days , thought seriously about setting it on fire , then finally put the house up for sale .
i'm prepared to offer you this much .
he had a number of interested buyers , but he always found a reason not to sell it to them .
no .
either the bids were too low , or if they met his asking price , he felt it was worth a lot more .
it's a lot of money , but i'll take it .
$50, 000 .
that's more than my asking price .
that's right .
it's a great deal more .
he told the man that offered him $5, 000 over his price that no one in his right mind would do that and he wouldn't have a lunatic living in his house .
he worked out his frustration with life on the creek every morning .
and in the evenings , to temper the sting of loneliness , there was martha shaw .
martha was a war widow who lived in quail ridge , a town away .
so you want to go out tomorrow?
i got to work .
well , we could down to the river if you want to .
next week , sometime .
maybe we could take a drive somewhere?
no .
well , i'm just asking you .
what do you want , noah?
what do you mean , what do i want?
from me .
sometimes when you talk to me , you don't even see me .
look , a woman knows when a man looks into her eyes and sees someone else .
now you know i want to give you all the things that you want , right?
but i can't , because they're gone ...
they're broken .
all right?
is the veil too much?
are you kidding?
you look perfect !
you're the most beautiful bride .
you look gorgeous , honey .
thank you .
wait until lon sees you in this dress , he's gonna go crazy .
he won't be able to take his eyes off you , or his hands .
oh , you're bad !
have you seen this morning's paper?
the " daily journal " says that you are going to be
the social highlight of the season .
of the season?
this is gonna be a celebration the likes of which this town's never seen !
she doesn't plan , she plots , doesn't she?
mama , look , the governor's coming .
he better .
let me see .
oh , boy .
all right savannah , where are we at?
we're 82 now .
memphis , where are at?
we're 89 now .
89 , great , up from 85 .
sir?
yes .
you have a visitor .
well , hello .
baby , i didn't know you were coming .
i'm ...
i'm so sorry , i should have called .
baby , what are you talking about?
you don't have to call .
guys , could you give us a minute?
all right .
yes , sir .
miss allie .
ma'am .
so what's up?
i don't paint anymore .
i used to paint all the time .
i really loved it .
i didn't know that .
yeah .
so paint .
i will .
i'm gonna start .
great .
is everything okay?
i need to get away .
okay .
i need to take care of a few things .
i need to clear my head .
okay , should i be worried?
no , i don't think so .
oh , that's reassuring .
listen , are you all right?
yeah .
okay , then go .
take your time , do whatever you need to do .
it's okay to be nervous , all right?
it's normal to get cold feet before your wedding .
no , no second thoughts , huh uh .
i love you .
i'm going to be back from seabrook in a couple of days , okay?
seabrook?
yeah , seabrook .
hello .
i saw your picture in the paper , the one with you and the house .
and i just wanted to come and see if you were okay .
i mean , i wasn't in the neighborhood or anything .
i just ...
so are you okay?
okay , good .
i'm a stupid woman , i shouldn't have come .
you want to come in?
okay .
this is a good story .
i'm glad you like it .
i think i've heard it before .
yes .
perhaps more than once?
doctor needs to see you .
me?
now?
no , him .
but he hasn't finished reading his story .
i'll read some more when i'm through with the doctor .
this shouldn't take too long .
all right .
don't you go away .
i'll be right back .
while you waiting , maybe you'd like to play the piano for a few minutes .
you do like that .
i do?
mm hmm .
i don't know any tunes .
you can read music .
no kidding?
mm hmm .
who are you?
i'm dr. barnwell , one of the new attending physicians .
we haven't met , so i thought i'd examine you myself .
okay , so i see here that you've had two heart attacks over the last 18 months .
yeah , minor ones , i think one was angina .
okay , any complications?
nope , feel fine .
okay , deep breath for me .
okay , one more time .
and deep breath .
and one more .
terrific , terrific .
you still taking your medication?
every day , twice a day .
good , good , good , good , good .
okay , you can put your shirt on .
so i understand that you read to miss hamilton .
yeah , to help her remember .
hmm .
you don't think it'll help?
no , i don't .
she remembers , doc .
i read to her and she remembers .
not always , but she remembers .
but senile dementia is irreversible .
it's degenerative .
after a certain point , its victims don't come back .
yeah , that's what they keep telling me .
well , i just don't want you to get your hopes up .
well , thanks , doc , but you know what they say?
science goes only so far and then comes god .
then comes god .
damn , i forgot to turn the page for her .
you through with me?
i guess they flipped that page .
no , that she's playing by memory .
his name is lon hammond , jr .
hammond?
as in hammond cotton?
as in hammond cotton .
well , your parents must love him .
he's a really good man , noah .
you'd really like him .
you love him?
yeah , i do .
i love him very much .
well , that's that .
you marry lon and we can be friends ... right?
right .
are you hungry?
do you want to stay for dinner?
umm ...
i have to warn you , i'm a cheap drunk .
a couple more of these and you're gonna be carrying me right out of here .
well , you go slow then , i don't want to have to take advantage of you .
you wouldn't dare .
i'm a married woman .
not yet .
what?
why are you looking at me like that?
just memories .
this room .
this ... is this where we ...
this is the room?
huh ...
i'm full .
me too .
oh how your fingers drowse me .
your breath falls around me like dew .
your pulse lulls the tympans of my ears .
i feel a merge from head to foot .
delicious enough .
it was real , wasn't it?
you and me .
such a long time ago , we were just a couple of kids .
but we really loved each other , didn't we?
i should go .
goodbye .
do you think you could back tomorrow morning?
there's some place i'd like to show you .
please .
okay .
okay .
she had come back into his life
like a sudden flame , blazing and streaming into his heart .
noah stayed up all night contemplating the certain agony he knew would be his , if he were to lose her twice .
oh , i do wish i could figure out the end of this story .
the children are here .
children?
not yours , his .
oh ...
do you mind?
why , i'd love to meet them .
come over here .
hi , daddy .

she seems good today .
she is good .
i don't know , there's something about today .
maybe it's a day for a miracle .
daddy , come home .
mama doesn't know us .
she doesn't recognize you .
she'll never understand .
we miss you .
this is crazy , you living here .
yeah , you know we'll all help with mom .
we can take shifts visiting .
look , guys , that's my sweetheart in there .
i'm not leaving her .
this is my home now .
your mother is my home .
hello?
hey , there .
hi , who is this?
it's lon , who were you expecting?
uh , nobody , i ...
i just ...
i'm just surprised .
how ... how did you find me?
well , there's only one hotel in seabrook .
and when you didn't call , i got worried .
where you been?
are you all right?
you know , i feel like an idiot , 'cause i called your hotel about a hundred times .
i'm fine .
anything you want to tell me?
no .
no?
no .
okay .
lon , i love you .
call you tomorrow?
okay .
noah?
noah !
hey , there .
well , we better get going , the rain's coming in .
you like it?
it's spectacular .
it's like a dream .
do you want to feed them?
yeah .
what are they all doing here?
i don't know .
they're supposed to migrate to the guatemala sound .
they won't stay here?
no ... they'll go back where they came from .
you're different .
what do you mean?
just the way you look .
everything .
you look different too , but in a good way .
you know , you're kinda the same though .
yeah?
yeah .
and you really did it .
what?
everything .
the house ... it's beautiful what you did .
well , i promised you i would .
great .
we got to go .
noah !
why didn't you write me?
why?
it wasn't over for me .
i waited for you for seven years .
and now it's too late .
i wrote you 365 letters .
i wrote you every day for a year .
you wrote me?
yes .
you ...
it wasn't over .
it still isn't over .
oh ...
you got to be kidding me .
all this time , that's what i'd been missing?
let's do it again .
noah .
noah .
wake up .
wake up .
um mmm .
um mmm .
mm hmm .
mm hmm .
mmm ...
hi .
you're trying to kill me , woman .
huh uh .
mm hmm .
mmm ...
mmm ...
i need rest .
i need food so i can regain my strength .
okay , what do you want?
umm ... umm ... some pancakes .
okay .
and bacon .
okay .
and some chicken .
she's the one , isn't she?
can i meet her?
i'd really like to meet her .
i don't know if that's a good idea , martha .
so this is martha?
hi , i'm allie .
i've heard a lot about you .
i've heard a lot about you , too .
you want to come in?
are you sure?
yeah , yeah , noah's just saying how hungry he was .
and , you know , you could put on a pot of tea .
come on in .
come on in .
it was nice meeting you , martha .
nice meeting you too .
goodbye .
take care .
she's sensational .
she really is .
i'm really glad that i came , noah .
i'd forgotten what it's like .
for the first time since i lost richard ,
i feel like i've got something to look forward to .
mmm ...
lon is on his way here .
i'm afraid your father spilled the beans about noah , and when lon didn't hear from you again last night , he decided to come .
well , that's great .
that's just terrific .
you , me , noah and lon , one big happy family .
tell me about the letters , mother .
is it true?
yes .
you watched me cry myself to sleep for months and months and you never said anything .
how could you do that?
i'm sorry .
you're sorry?
you're sorry?
yes , i am ...
i am sorry .
because of you , my entire life is ruined !
okay , yes , i stole your letters .
it was wrong , but stop being dramatic and at least take some of the responsibility .
you came down here .
you knew what you were doing .
you knew this would happen .
oh , so now i'm a tramp?
you are unbelievable .
unbelievable .
go on and get some clothes on .
let's take a drive .
let's take a drive?
why would i want to go anywhere with you?
because i might know you a little better than you think .
and i don't want you waking up one morning thinking that if you'd known everything , you might have done something different .
what are we doing here , mama?
do you see that man , there?
mm hmm .
don't look like it now , but 25 years ago ... oh my goodness , he was really something .
we were out of our minds in love , let me tell you .
wow .
well , naturally , your grandfather was furious , so ... we decided to run away .
we didn't even make the next town before the police picked us up .
but that was then .
you know sometimes when i'm in the area ,
i just stop here and i watch him , trying to picture how different my life might have been .
i want you to know that i love your father .
mama , i'm ...
no , goddamn it , this is important and you need to hear it .
i do .
he is a wonderful man .
he is good to me and i don't deserve him .
i love him , allie , i do , i love him .
i know .
oh , god .
oh , this is just very embarrassing .
oh , i'm a stupid woman .
look at me , the big old bawl bag .
it's crazy .
i don't even know who that person is .
oh , boy .
okay .
allie !
here .
i hope you make the right choice .
interesting morning?
yeah .
lon's here in town .
he's here?
yeah , we saw his car on the way , at the hotel .
huh .
i see you got my letters .
finally .
what are you going to do , al?
i don't know .
we're back to that?
are we back there?
what about the past couple of days?
they happened , you know?
i know that they happened , and they were wonderful , but they were also very irresponsible .
i have a fiance waiting for me at a hotel , who's going to be crushed
when he finds out .
so you make love to me and then you go back to your husband?
was that your plan?
was that a test that i didn't pass? !
no , i made a promise to a man , he gave me a ring and i gave him my word .
and your word is shot to hell now ,
don't you think?
i don't ...
i don't know .
i'll find out when i talk to him .
this is not about keeping your promise , and it's not about following your heart , it's about security .
what is that supposed to mean?
money !
what are you ta ...
he's got a lot of money .
now i hate you , you smug bastard .
well , i hate you .
if you leave here , i hate you .
you wou ...
hate you if you leave here .
have you been paying attention to anything that's happening?
i guess not .
i think i must have misread
all of those signals .
i guess you did .
you're bored .
you're bored and you know it .
you wouldn't be here if there wasn't something missing .
you arrogant son of a bitch !
would you just stay with me?
stay with you?
what for?
look at us , we're already fighting .
well , that's what we do .
we fight .
you tell me when i'm being an arrogant son of a bitch and i tell you when you're being a pain in the ass .
which you are 99 % of the time .
i'm not afraid to hurt your feelings .
they have like a two second rebound rate and you're back doing the next pain in the ass thing .
so , what?
so it's not gonna be easy .
it's gonna be really hard .
and we're gonna have to work at this every day , but i want to do that , because i want you .
i want all of you , forever , you and me , every day .
will you do something for me?
please?
will you just picture your life for me?
30 years from now , 40 years from now , what's it look like?
if it's with that guy , go !
go !
i lost you once , i think i could do it again , if i thought it's what you really wanted .
but don't you take the easy way out .
what easy way?
there is no easy way , no matter what i do , somebody gets hurt .
would you stop thinking about what everyone wants .
stop thinking about what i want , what he wants , what your parents want .
what do you want?
what do you want?
it's not that simple .
what do you want?
it's not ...
goddamn it , what do you want?
i have to go .
my dearest allie ,
i couldn't sleep last night because i know that it's over between us .
i'm not bitter anymore , because i know that what we had was real .
and if in some distant place in the future we see each other in our new lives ,
i'll smile at you with joy and remember how we spent a summer beneath the trees
learning from each other and growing in love .
the best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach for more , that plants a fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds .
and that's what you've given me .
that's what i'd hoped to give to you forever .
i love you .
i'll be seeing you , noah .
it's beautiful .
it's a beautiful story .
yes , it is .
i don't know why , but it makes me feel sad .
i know you feel lost right now , but don't worry , nothing is ever lost , nor can be lost .
the body sluggish , aged , cold , the embers left from earlier fires .
shall duly flame again .
did you write that?
no , that was walt whitman .
i think i knew him .
i think you did .
shall we go in?
i'm feeling a little chilly .
okay .
thank you .
well , who did all of this?
i did , with a little help from my friends on the nursing staff .
oh ...
i've never seen anything so beautiful .
neither have i.
shall we?
some grape juice?
i'd love it .
ah , so many pills .
how sick are you?
the sickness has become a relative term for me .
i think of it now as more a general wearing out process .
to you .
so what happened?
in the story , which one did she choose?
okay , the way i see it , i got three choices .
one , i can shoot him .
two , i can kick the crap out of him .
or three ...
i leave you .
well , all that's no good .
you see , 'cause ... none of those options get me you .
and in spite of everything ,
i love you .
i love you too .
i meant what i said when i gave you that ring .
i did too .
i did too .
it's just that when i'm ... when i'm with noah i feel like one person and when i'm with you i feel like someone totally different .
look , it's normal not to forget your first love .
i love you , allie , but i want you for myself .
i don't want to have to convince my fiance that she should be with me .
you don't have to .
i already know i should be with you .
and they lived happily ever after .
who?
who did?
oh yes , of course .
i remember now .
it was us .
it was us .
it was us .
oh , my darling .
oh my sweetheart .
i love you so much .
oh , my baby .
noah , noah .
i love you , angel .
what happened to me?
nothing .
