they got a bleeding generator grinding away .
lights on all over the place .
not expecting visitors , are they?
spread out .
take cover .
let's not wake them up .
you gonna use grenades , captain?
may not be too easy .
might bounce against those screens .
yeah .
i suppose they might .
scott .
sir?
do you think , i mean , given a chance ... that you could operate the kind of transmitter they've got in there?
i'll have to have a look at it , but it's probably basically the same thing .
good .
i think we might give it a try .
give what a try?
if the three of us could get in there unnoticed ...
i could dispose of him ... and you two could send back our fake message on their transmitter .
rather a nice touch of irony , don't you think?
what're you trying to pull , captain?
that wasn't in our orders .
no , lieutenant .
it's evident that one of us has to get in there in any case ... to make sure of destroying their transmitter .
so why not go the whole hog?
our orders were damn plain , captain .
we were to send the message on our transmitter .
if that didn't work out , we were to destroy theirs .
but nobody said a damn thing ...
do be quiet .
i'm going over there to deal with the operator .
when you see me come back to the window , you and scott will join me .
we'll send our message , destroy their transmitter , and leave .
is that clear?
yes , sir .
no , sir .
i'm having no part of it , captain .
you're disobeying orders and going beyond your authority .
you'll do as you're told .
what about that sentry , sir?
keep him covered , but don't shoot unless he does .
not even if he sees me .
even if he sees you?
i'm going to walk straight across there .
even if he does see me , he's quite likely to assume i'm one of his chaps .
sir .
what is it?
you'd look a lot less english without that hat on .
captain !
i'm telling you now .
you're going against col. thompson's orders .
if you go in there , i'm not going with you .
you hear me?
i haven't got time to argue , lieutenant .
you know what you have to do .
there he is .
what's the matter?
you heard me tell him i'm not going in there .
we're running out of time .
what's the matter with you?
i told him .
come on , scott .
let's go !
are you ready to transmit yet?
i think so , sir .
where the devil's the lieutenant?
i don't know , sir .
lawson !
i told him .
i know you did .
but they're in there now , waiting for you .
go on , get moving !
come on , move !
where's the lieutenant?
how the hell should i know?
i haven't seen him .
have you?
of course i haven't .
then let's go .
i don't know .
you can please yourself , what you do .
i'm off .
i'm not waiting around for that rubbish sack .
coming in , hearne .
what're you doing?
you're supposed to be gone three minutes ago .
yes , sir .
i was only waiting for you because i thought you ...
blimey .
this is a turn up for the book .
oh , god , looks like the whole japanese air force out there .
look at that .
like the swing shift at lockheed .
i don't believe it .
three rousing , great cheers for american air reconnaissance .
let's get the hell out of here .
come on .
get me out of here !
what're you stopping for?
which way?
to the right , go around .
come on .
go around .
to the right , come on !
give us covering fire , thornton .
what's that?
scatter .
good afternoon , gentlemen .
this is major yamaguchi ... who has the pleasure of addressing you .
no doubt you are quite amazed to hear my voice .
in order to be sure ... that you are hearing me ...
i was obliged to make this speech five times today .
but tomorrow , as we close in on you ... you will hear only four such speeches .
on saturday ... if you have not already been killed or captured ... only two .
captured?
if you look at your map , you will see ... that as you travel south ... towards your base ... your situation is like that of water ... in a funnel .
what's he on about?
do you understand?
like water in a funnel .
no matter where you may now be , or which route you take ... you will eventually wish to emerge at your base .
as the funnel narrows ... as you get closer to home ... we will have less and less area to cover ... in our search for you .
we have found your abandoned radio transmitter .
we know our air power in this area ... came as a surprise to you ... and you must communicate this information to your base .
but this will not happen .
within three days ... you will all be killed or captured .
there is , however , an alternative .
you should consider it carefully .
if you will all surrender now ... just one week from today , by which time ... your plans and ours will be an open secret ... you will be released ... and allowed to return to your own base .
this offer is a reasonable one .
certainly you should consider it carefully .
but , remember , it must be all of you .
there can be no exceptions .
i shall speak to you again tomorrow , by which time ...
i hope that good sense will have prevailed .
if you wish to take advantage of our offer ... you will fire a single shot as a signal .
up your khyber .
that is all .
good day , gentlemen .
and good day to you , you malignant yellow dwarf .
they must be right behind us .
if that amplification's strong enough , they could be a helluva long way .
what do you think , sir?
about what?
it seems like they're on to us .
do you think they mean what they're saying?
don't be bloody stupid .
he did say they'd treat us all right .
they'll chop your bloody head off .
since when have you been an expert?
what do you know about it , bigmouth?
a sight more than you do , pig face .
i saw what they did in the hospital in singapore .
you were so busy running you never even saw a jap ...
let alone what they did to our lads .
they won't take us to a rest camp now that we know where that airstrip is .
he's right .
damn right .
now let's get out of here .
okay , come on .
all right , move out .
all right , get some sleep .
god , i'm tired .
got to sleep .
got to .
good morning , gentlemen .
this is saturday .
and the funnel in which you are trapped is rapidly narrowing .
i anticipated that you'd accept my terms .
instead , you evidently marched ... throughout the day , and , perhaps , most of the night .
a remarkable effort .
your leader must be a man of great determination .
you have very little reason to be pleased with him ... because his stubborn determination ... has inspired me ... to alter the terms of our offer .
this offer now has a time limit .
you have until sundown to surrender .
after that , you will be killed on sight .
in war , one must take harsh measures .
i'm sorry if you do not like these new rules ... but the responsibility rests with your leader .
remember , you have only to fire a single shot .
but please remember also ... that any surrender must include all of you .
you understand?
all of you .
i will give you a few minutes to consider your decision .
how about it now , lieutenant?
what?
quit?
no way .
they're not getting their hands on me .
this time tomorrow , i'll be back at that camp .
i don't think you know what you're talking about .
even the jap said it was all your fault .
i think we should turn in .
what do you say , thornton?
look , mate ...
i couldn't give a bugger about the yank's reasons for wanting to carry on ... because i happen to know they're half baked anyway .
and if you want to believe that jap , you can , but they're not gonna get me .
i'd sooner shoot you than trust them .
as a matter of fact ... much sooner .
how do you know the japs are lying?
what makes you think they're all that different from us?
that's right , kid , they're not .
that's why that jap major could be lying , just like i would .
you remain indecisive .
i am sorry .
perhaps when you have rested ... you will feel different .
but the conditions remain the same .
you have until dusk to give yourselves up .
that is all .
i knew it .
he wants to draw our fire and kill us all .
how do you know that's what he said?
wanna wait a couple of minutes?
they'll be here .
in that case , now's the time to pack it in .
watch it , darling .
they're coming .
clear that place .
get down !
knife .
come on , let's get out of here .
get him out of there .
quick , damn it .
come on , you guys , give us a hand .
get him out of there .
griffiths , get my pack .
yes , sir .
mclean !
yes , sir?
get behind him .
pick him up and get him up the hill .
come on .
move down .
he can't move .
come on .
quick , hurry up .
come on , damn it .
move your ass !
come on !
move !
that's the way .
i'll lead them off up here .
that's the way .
day and night , service is on hand , sir .
come on , boys .
don't drop him now .
watch out for those man eating trout .
easy .
you weigh a bleeding ton .
that's it .
easy , thorny .
tosh , my old buddy , how does it look back there?
it's not so bad .
you'll be all right .
what kind of nonsense is that , man?
i can feel where the scorching thing went in , and i can't feel where it came out .
yeah , you are leaking a bit .
hold up !
that makes your eyes water , doesn't it?
is that tight enough?
yeah .
right , now put your little pinkie on the knot .
that's right .
very pretty .
i'm ready for my coming out ball .
you'll get " coming out " in a minute .
take your finger away when i say , " go .
ready , steady , go .
there we are .
i shouldn't worry about it .
no , you shouldn't , but maybe i should?
that bloody yankee poonagger's not coming back .
that's all right .
thornton's not going anywhere , are you , jock?
no , i'm having my change of life .
can he walk?
only on the water .
yeah .
that's it then .
do you hear that , lads?
if anyone's going mad ...
we've either got to leave him here or turn ourselves in , right?
i already told you , nobody's turning it in .
what are you gonna do with him?
you can't bloody carry him back , can you?
you're so bloody clever , hearne .
what are you gonna do with him?
listen , you poxed up glaswegian queer !
it's bad enough sitting here full of bloody holes ... without listening to you open your ugly face !
knock it off .
i can hear you halfway down the trail .
what's the matter with you guys , anyway?
it's thornton , sir .
he can't walk .
i was just saying we've either gotta leave him here or turn ourselves in .
now , suppose you let me worry about that?
meanwhile , you just rest your toes because we're leaving before dark .
back in a minute , thorny .
thanks , tosh .
that blood's worth bottling .
look at that pair .
i see snow white's found his first dwarf .
a right teddy bear's picnic this has turned out to be .
how long has thornton got?
i don't know .
but he won't be here next week , that's for certain .
where are you going?
where are you off?
you know what that yank's gonna do , don't you?
what?
he's not leaving you here alive .
he'd sooner kill you himself .
kill me?
why shouldn't he?
all he cares about is getting back to the camp .
he doesn't give a bugger about you .
i heard him say so .
go to hell .
the only thing to do to get you out of here safely ... to see you're looked after , is to turn ourselves in .
i'll go with mclean and griffiths and talk to the japs .
you try that and i'll shoot you myself .
don't be daft , man .
what else is there?
you cowardly pig .
you just want to save your own skin , you hear me?
now look here , thornton .
for god's sake , man ... can't you even leave a fellow in peace?
i'm sorry .
i really am .
i was only thinking of you .
come on , take a wee drop of water .
come on , now .
i'll hold it up for you .
come on , drink it now .
mclean !
quickly !
wake up !
wake up !
thornton's had it !
there's no telling what the yank will do now .
what is it?
come on , wake up .
what's the matter?
thornton's dead .
come on !
what about tosh?
leave him .
you can't leave tosh .
once we get to the japs , we'll all be all right .
him as well .
wake up !
wake up , you stupid bastard !
where the hell are they?
how the bloody hell do i know?
you're the one who's supposed to be on guard .
stupid , dirty bastards !
you going after them?
no , it's too late .
they're probably closer to the japs than we are .
the only way they'll stay alive is by telling that jap major where we are .
come on , let's go .
good afternoon , gentlemen .
from what your comrades have told me ...
i may assume that you are now hearing me .
as you must know ... your comrades decided to try and save their lives ... by surrendering and informing us of your position .
but you escaped ... and so their fate is still in doubt .
their surrender is of little value unless you choose to join them .
if you will surrender before dark ...
i shall keep my word .
you will be well treated ... and released in only a few days .
the man , campbell , did not merit such good treatment .
he was found to be carrying the personal effects of one of our officers ... our communications lieutenant ... who has been missing since last tuesday .
his body was discovered yesterday .
our lieutenant was very popular with his men .
you would understand that there was little i could do to restrain them ...
even if i had wanted to .
it has been an incident in which none of us can take pride .
however , the real problem still remains .
you must decide what you want done with the two comrades ... who are still our prisoners .
it is for you to say if they shall live .
if you wish to stay alive ... you must persuade your two friends to surrender .
do you understand?
yes , sir .
you may talk to them .
lieutenant?
tosh?
it's me , mclean .
it's right , what the major was saying .
about campbell , i mean .
they showed us the stuff he stole from the officer ... and how he chopped his finger off to get the ring .
there wasn't anything anyone could've done to stop them .
but we're all right .
it is necessary for you to persuade them .
i know we shouldn't have gone off with campbell like we did .
and i know we shouldn't have told them where you were hiding ... but it was campbell's idea , and we thought it was for the best .
listen , if you don't give yourselves up now ... we'll be the ones who end up paying for it .
your corporal is giving you excellent advice .
there is no longer a choice for any of you .
either you surrender and live ... or if you attempt to postpone the inevitable ... then i shall withdraw my offer ... and your two comrades will die tonight .
the decision is yours .
you have until nightfall to decide .
please , lieutenant ... do like he says .
tosh , please !
i couldn't care less what they do to those two .
whatever that jap's gonna do , he's gonna do .
it's got nothing to do with what we're gonna do .
if you mean it ain't gonna make us surrender ...
i'm with you .
but if you think we're gonna try and get back to camp by tomorrow ... you must be bloody mad .
that's exactly what we're gonna do .
we hit that clearing on the edge of that camp ... if there are two of us ... we're gonna have twice as much a chance of getting through .
and , buddy boy ... you're going with me every step of the way .
listen , lieutenant ... neither of us wants to get killed , right?
i've never believed any of the guff that jap's been giving us , either .
i know once he lays his hands on us ... he'll finish us off , no matter what he says .
so , up until now ... the only way of staying alive was getting back to camp .
but now there's another way .
something that nobody else thought of .
nobody except me , that is .
what?
it's very simple .
we double back , head north for two or three hours ... duck off the trail , sleep for a couple of days ... and we'll be laughing .
laughing?
yeah , laughing .
because once the jap dive bombers ... get stuck into the yank ships monday morning ... the jap major won't be looking for us anymore .
right?
he couldn't care less where we are then .
we can just lie low for a couple of days ... stroll back into camp ... and nobody will say a dickie bird .
what's so bad about that?
i never asked those idiots to send me out here .
well done , hearne .
jolly good show .
now you can piss off home ...
back to whatever dirty little hole you came from .
and what are they gonna do for you , lieutenant?
make you the bloody president?
no .
getting ourselves killed ... isn't going to make any difference to anybody except us .
look , yank ... the last thing that jap major is gonna be looking for ... is us heading north .
so what do you say?
you got any idea how many guys will get killed on those ships ... if we haven't got the guts to try and stop them?
okay , so a couple of hundred yanks will get the chop .
they shouldn't have joined , should they?
hundreds?
thousands .
in any case , it's not the bloody yanks you're worried about ... because if their chances depend on us getting back ... they've just about had it in the first place .
no , what's got you jumping about like a frog with a bullet up its ass ... is old fairy feet hornsby ... because you reckon you let him down .
and that's the one bloody time you've been right .
you did .
you might just as well have killed him yourself .
but getting us killed isn't gonna make up for that .
so hornsby is your problem .
and those yank sailors are your problem .
and if you wanna start playing bloody heroes ...
i've got another problem for you .
i'm not bloody well coming with you .
you forgot your problem .
me .
i told you before ... one of us has gotta get back there alive .
and if you don't go with me , i'll have to leave you here .
dead .
understood?
understood .
just don't forget .
gentlemen , your time is up !
i shall give you 30 seconds .
if you do not give yourselves up ...
i shall be forced to execute your two comrades .
let me talk to him .
listen to me , lieutenant , please .
you've gotta listen to me .
they're gonna kill us .
just like they killed campbell .
please , lieutenant , don't let them do it .
do you really find it so easy to believe that i would shoot you?
keep going .
get up .
there's not much further to go .
how the hell would you know?
there can't be .
no more , thank you , sir .
thank you , sir .
get up , you limey son of a bitch , or i'll kick your head in !
get up .
good morning , again .
you must be very tired .
you have come a long way during the night .
a truly remarkable effort .
remarkable , but to very little purpose .
shut up , you slimy yellow nob .
you have moved fast ... but we have moved faster .
you will find that you are now very near the open field ... that serves as a perimeter to your base .
but some of my men are already on that perimeter .
in short , you are now totally surrounded .
you are now at the very tip of the funnel i have talked about so often .
i can understand your determination ... but to give up your lives for an objective ... which cannot be won is a foolish waste .
you have shown yourselves to be brave soldiers .
it shows us that you are intelligent ones also .
give yourselves up and live .
i assure you , the medals they give to dead heroes are made of brass .
all they do is add weight to your coffin .
you bloody idiot !
believe me ... your situation is truly hopeless .
all trails leading back into the jungle are under guard .
this means ... that you can no longer hide ... you can no longer double back on your tracks .
what's that all about?
better get the sergeant major .
i shall give you three minutes during which time ... you will wish to confirm for yourselves ... that what i have said is true .
at the end of that time ... you must either surrender or die .
you will fire a single shot to indicate that you have surrendered .
or my men will close in and kill .
stand to !
what is it?
don't know what it is , sergeant major .
get col. thompson !
double !
get the color sergeant .
yes , sergeant major .
what the hell is it?
what is it , sergeant major?
i don't know what it is .
i've sent for the old man .
you better man the weapon pits .
right .
come on , let's have you fast now !
what do you think this is , kensington gardens?
come on !
get in with that gun !
get in there .
make sure the men stay back , sergeant .
you men know the drill !
keep back !
stay out of enemy range !
laid on !
morning , sir .
morning , sergeant major .
everything in order?
yes , sir .
mortars?
all weapon pits are manned , sir .
sounds like loudspeakers of some kind .
got any more bright suggestions?
my patience is growing very short .
he must think we've still got a chance .
who must?
guchi .
why are they giving us three minutes?
why don't they just come and get us?
yeah .
why?
i don't know .
maybe they're spread too thin .
maybe they're afraid to come in , for fear of chasing us out in the open .
yeah , and having to waste all those bullets to shoot us?
maybe .
but there's still two of us ... and one of us just might make it .
you now have only two and a half more minutes .
we could sure use some covering fire .
think your guys will be doing anything?
yeah .
having breakfast .
we could use all the help we can get .
maybe if we fire that shot ...
why waste a bullet?
what do you mean?
fire one shot and maybe we'll confuse the japs a bit .
but if we could kill their major ... they wouldn't have anyone to tell them what to do .
they'd be running about all over the place .
might give us a head start .
and that little bastard's been asking for it for a long time , hasn't he?
this way .
two minutes .
you now have only one and a half more minutes , gentlemen .
stand them to , sergeant .
all guns stand to !
the rest of you keep back !
out of enemy range !
it worked .
they've gone back .
don't forget to zigzag .
you zig , i'll zag .
look there !
there they are !
can you make out which ones they are?
lay down covering fire , sergeant !
hurry !
give those men covering fire !
correct right , sergeant !
three turns more right !
more left !
come on !
he's all right .
he's alive .
he's getting up .
he's alive !
cease fire !
all guns cease fire !
machine gunners , stand by to give us covering fire !
take it easy , lad .
were there any other survivors?
was it just the two of you?
who was that with you out there?
i said ... who was that with you out there?
out there ... he was a bloody hero .
he killed ... fifteen bleeding japs ... single handed .
killed fifteen?
thirty , if you like .
