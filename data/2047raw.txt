the last slgn
looking back now ...
i see how easy was to fool myself thinking everything
so much pain for nothing .
we were taken by surprise .
we like to think that bad things can only happen to
after you died jeremy ...
i thought we may find peace in our lives again .
but death is not always as final as sometimes we think it
yes?
mrs. macfarlane?
we're from the real state .
just a second , i'll get the key .
i'm so sorry , i can't find the keys .
can we take a look from the outside?
yes .
of course .
will you allow access to the garden?
it's a standard
i suppose it covers all possible options .
it's just that i have children .
i'll have a look at the back .
excuse me .
i can't do it anymore .
the kids and i are leaving .
you want to leave me?
mrs. macfarlane?
location is perfect .
actually , we might have someone .
oh , so soon !
a french engineer with excellent credencials .
came to work at a project .
it'll be a short term contract .
i don't know about that .
that way we can get you a much higher price .
well , i'll have to think about it .
mrs. macfarlane?
please , give us a call when you reach a decision .
i appreciate it .
thank you .
good bye .
why did you do that for?

i stand on the trail .
see?
good , then go wash up .
before or after dinner?
don't push me .
fine .
eight is my lucky number .
you can write it without even taking your pen off the paper .
i think we should get married on the eighth .
why the eighth?
it's the infinite number .
look .
goes on forever ...

i'm dora .
human resources .
i'd say you're either cancer or leo .
i'm a cancer , actually .
i thought too .
because you're the only person ... who had the courage to eat the junior melt on thursday .
it's not that bad , really .
yeah?
tell me that in a month .
nice to meet you .
you too .
there's no much i can do .
you understand that , if you don't make these payments you'll risk your possession .
yes , but i'm back at work now ... and i intend to rent my late husband's medical clinic .
let me see .
i might be able to give you a month .
mrs. macfarlane?
sorry .
a month extension .
this is the best i can do .
i see .
well , thank you .
it started acting up this morning .
it's the first time it's ever

i didn't mean to scare you .
mrs. macfarlane?
yes?
i'm your new tenant .

i'm sorry .
i just wasn't expecting you .
i came early and your sister gave me the keys .
i hope it's ok?

why are you home so late?
i was so busy at the lab .
i'll catch your plate .
thank you .
have you met your new neighbour?
yes .
he seems to be a good guy .
maybe .
i'm starting to have second thoughts about renting there .
no , kathy , it's a good thing .
now you're going to have some close company .
exactly , that's what bothers me .
who is it?
nobody .
probably wrong number .
go back to bed .
what's that?
your dad's old shoes .
just a small junk .
come on isabel , we're late .
we're coming .
good morning , everybody .
good morning .
hurry up , guys .
we're going to miss the bus .
hi , there .
hi .
see you later , isabel .
do you mind if i sit down here?
of course not .
you are not having the tune melt .
i took your advice .
trouble at the bank?
just a little .
you're a widow , aren't you?
yes , i am .
you think about him all the time , don't you?
the first time i saw you , i knew we had something in
my peer left this earth about 15 years ago ... and i thought i'd go crazy !
i realized he was watching out for me .
he was talking to me .
i talked back !
why not?
we do that all the time .
i'm throwing myself a birthday party on saturday ... so , why don't you ... just come and let your hair down?
i'm not much of a party person .
it's going to be 58 , in case you were wondering .
i look to be 54 , but i'll be 58 .
no excuses , no presents .
come .
i swear ...
i swear ... no more drinking .
any drop .
never again .
they all died , kathy .
all these beautiful kids .
they all died .
there was nothing i could do .
i'm sorry .
we can't live like this anymore .
that was good .
that was really good .
i'm telling you .
the man's party went all night long .
you should have joined them instead of playing alone .
i'm telling you kathy , you got to start moving on .
i'm trying , isabel .
but i can't .
it's like jeremy were still here , i'm afraid i'm going to wake and find him on the couch who knows in what state .
he really put you through hell , didn't he?
i'm still at it .
it's just like him .
his last selfish gesture .
leaving us right when the kids needed him most .
but they got you .
and they're wonderful kids .
who'd want to be one of them?
no father and a histerical mother .
you're a great mom .
and they're very lucky to have you .
this is a tooth of luck ... and this will help you ward off evil spirit .
we could all use one of those .
isn't that gorgeous?
oh , darling , i didn't get you a drink !
i'm fine .
no , what a bad hostess .
come on .
let's get you all set up , loosing you up and put you in a party
hey , dora !
ed , you look gorgeous in pink !
thank you .
darling , this is kathy .
could you get her a drink?
just a glass of water would be great .
water , so , the real party !
ed doesn't drink water .
he's an artist .
zelda !
oh , my god !
i'll be right back .
beyond death and grlef
that's a great choice .
it's a perfect book for you .
it's not really my kind of thing .
you've dropped your matches here .
that can't be mine , i don't smoke .
well , i certainly don't smoke and i've never been to the
is that a nice hotel?
yes , it's a very nice hotel .
i get the feeling ... these are definitely your matches .
i tell you what ...
this book ... is my gift to you .
why don't you make yourself comfortable?
try to absorb it ... and then when you're ready , come and rejoin the party , ok?
happy ever after .
happy forever .
i love you , kathy .
i want to live with you forever .
i'll always love you .

yeah , right .
how have you been fergus?
great .
fresh as a new born .

too bad .
it's not something you can wash off .
how are you doing with yourself?
not bad .
fine , really .
you know since ...
dr. macfarlane left us .
the dr. would never leave you .
he wouldn't do a thing like
no , fergus .
you don't understand .
he's gone forever .
you'll see , he'll be back .
he's dead .
don't you get it , fergus?
dead .
yeah , right .
but nothing is forever .
he'll be back , mrs. macfarlene .
i'm telling you he'll be back .
you can't leave me .
i called the hospital , he's not there .
take it easy .
he's just out with his friends somewhere .
why he doesn't call me?
because he's probably having too much fun !
isabel , here comes a car .
i'll call you back .
mrs. macfarlane ...
your son is in the car .
don't worry , he's ok .
he got into a fight with a friend , but it's not as bad as it
he was up on the road , waiting till you've gone to bed .
he scared me to death .
don't be to hard .
frank .
what happened?
god , look at you , baby !
i'm fine .
it's a bruise .
frank .
he's just upset .
let's go clean him up .
don't move .
almost done .
so , do i have to call steve's father to find out what
what did i tell you?
your mother has a right to worry about you , you know?
the project is good .
just a moment , i'll call you back .
is there a problem with frank?
no .
i've been getting anonimous calls ... every night at 12 : 15 .
i looked up my window , and there you were ...
and you thought it was me?
how long has this been going on?
ever since you came .
anyone you suspect?
from work , maybe?
i think i know someone who can help .
don't worry , i'll take care of it tomorrow .
so , who were you calling so late?
france , my mother .
she wakes up early .
sorry about that .
that's ok .
what in god's name are you doing?
kathy , what's up here?
i lost my ring .
i guess i didn't take your advice seriously .
oh , honey , i'm so sorry !
what a shame !
i don't know why that keeps happening to me !
because you're full of energy .
i wish .
most of the time i'm completely drained .
is there something you want to tell me?
no , i don't think so .
just a thought .
i better get back to work .
ok .
here , that's every single call you got this month .
inclunding the unknown number .
but you didn't get it from
right .
rachel , kathy .
kathy is my landlady .
i really appreciate this .
it's no problem .
i got to go .
they'll be wondering where i
i owe you one .
as i told you , our records ... don't show any call to that number .
look , mr. some lunatic in this hotel get his kicks every by tormenting this lady .
so , unless you help us , we are going to the police .
is that clear?
i understand your concern ... but our records really ...
look , if i could just talk to fergus o'brian , he's a bellboy
ruth .
yes .
is there a fergus o'brian working here?
he's a little skinny guy .
twenty something ...
bellboy .
never heard of him .
but i just spoke with him here , the other night .
i don't know any fergus o'brian .
miss , i would like to speak to the manager .
ok , follow me .
excuse me , i'm looking for another bellboy that works here ... his name is fergus o'brian .
it's just me and rudy .

ok , here's what i got .
the people from the moon river are not going to tell us the
but i talked to the manager ... and tomorrow they're going to teach that kid a lesson .
so , no more phones .
i hope so .
what's your connection with this fergus?
he was a pacient of my husband .
i see .
thanks , marc .
you're welcome .
he was trying to kill himself .
you should call an ambulance .
let it stop .
want to have lunch?
look .
my god , where was it?
in the laundry .
i was positive i had lost it here .
well , it found you !
objects can travel thousands of miles if they got a reason .
it's a sign .
yes , of my negligence .
no , it's a sign that jeremy is trying to get in touch with you .
i never told you his name .
oh , yes .
human resources .
kathy , you got to listen .
i can help you get in touch with him .
it's not really my kind of thing .
hand me number 11 .
yes .

sweet dreams .
mom?

i hate him for it .

he was a very sick man ... and i just couldn't cope .
i just want you to be happy .
i'm sorry i've been so hard on you lately ... it's just that i worry .
you scare me .
so impulsive .

well , that's a tough one .
i do have this little place near paris ... but it's locked up most of the time .
no kids?
i never had the chance to pursue a meeting for realtionship .
that's too bad .
you're really good with kids .
my kids really like you , especially frank .
he doesn't make friends easy .
neither do i.
you don't give me that impression .
what impression do i give?
that of a strange guy , who makes calls in the middle of the just to attract your attention?
thanks .
what about your husband?
jeremy was an idealist .
he thought that medicine could change the world .
up into the moment he joined an organization abroad .
where?
central africa .
that's when he started drinking .
he used to say the politics of food and medical aid was a
it's not fun to talk about .
all i know is that i'm tired , old , ugly .
you may be tired , but you're not old ... and you are certainly not ugly .
in fact , i'd be happy to tell you how you're beautiful
ok , it's a deal .

you guys , what's wrong with you?

he won't talk to me .
he doesn't want you to leave .

it's fergus !
he stopped breathing .
out of the way .
you are ok .
fergus?
mrs. macfarlane .
i'm glad to see you .
i'm afraid i can't say the same .
i quit the hotel , i wasn't good for that job .
i heard you came looking for me .
tell the truth , fergus .
you're the one who's been calling me .
twelve fifteen precisely , every night .
that's not some kind of joke , frightening people like that .
i was doing a friend a favour .
what friend?
dr. macfarlane , of course .
that's not funny .
he asked me to contact you to tell you ...
stop !
he wants you to ...
hey , there !
i'm going to have a word with your mother .
mrs. macfarlane .
well this is such a pleasant surprise !
please , do come in and i'll give you some coffee .

five years .
my god , how time flies .
what brought you into the
i'm actually here to talk to you about fergus .
my son , fergus?
what about him?
i don't know why .
but i thought you should know ...
fergus has been calling me almost every night , for the past
are you allright , mrs. macfarlane?
yes , why?
fergus is dead .
been dead for six months .
you should know that .
kathy .
certlficate of death
12 : 15 am .
i'm scared .
allright , come here .
it's just a rain , guys .
don't worry , it's fine .
what's up?
we're going to aunt isabel .
what?
now?
yes , right away .
get your coats on , quick .
it's a storm .
just do as i say .
i'm not going .
yes , you're .
i'm your mother , now get in the car .
let's go , mommy .
damn it !
take your foot off the gas .
stop !
kathy , no !
this is crazy !
you can't leave me !
i'll find you !
i'll find you , kathy .
wherever you go , i'll find you !
what the hell are you doing?
slow down !
what's going on?
where is isabel?
inside , come on , get in .
what's going on?
do you know the phone calls i've been getting at 12 : 15 am?
it's jeremy's time of death , 12 : 15 !
yeah , some crank at the record's office ...
no , isabel .
jeremy died the night i'd left him .
this kid , fergus , came back from the dead to tell me
kathy , you're so stressed out .
he's making the phone calls because he owes jeremy a
the dead don't make phone calls , honey .
why don't you let the kids stay with us for a while?
yes , they need protection .
this isn't the way to do .
you're scaring the hell out of them .
he said he'd come after us no matter where we were .
honey , that's not going to happen .
the dead don't scare me .
just couch potatoes do that .
lte's go make up the rooms .
i knew you'd finally come .
come on .
i can't believe this is happening to me .
maybe i'm going crazy .
no , you're not .
i promise you .
now i want you to try and see this from another perspective .
maybe death doesn't really exist .
maybe it's just a gateway to another reality .
but i'm a scientist , dora .
i only believe in things that can be proven .
try and see this exeprience ... as a blessing .
a very few people get this opportunity .
you told me ... that the bellboy said he thought he was doing jeremy a
i think that your jeremy sent fergus to talk to you ... because he wanted to talk to you himself but he couldn't .
i think he's in a lot of pain !
jeremy doesn't exist .
i buried him .
he's just dirt and worms .
we're going to try a contact .
just goig to try .
just try .
don't be scared .
i want you to put your hands flat down on the table ...
i want you to relax .
breath from here .
slowly ...
and in ... two ... that's it .
relax , relax .
there you go .
one ... two ... three ... four ...
out .
two ... three ... four ...
in .
two , three , four .
i want you ... to open yourself up to jeremy .
open yourself ...
i'm sorry .
no , i can't .
jeremy needs you to forgive him , kathy .
i'm just confused , that's all .
i shouldn't have come in , dora .
you have got to forgive him for your own piece of mind .
you've got to throw out the bad stuff and focus on the good
yes , the good moments .
look for the signs , kathy .
look for the signs .
a scotch , please .
make that two .
i'm expecting someone .
i need to know what it feels like .
stop pretending you quit drinking .
where have you been?
kathy?
it's marc .
happy birthday .
anybody at home?
i came looking for the kids earlier , but ...
i brought something for them .
they're at isabel's house for a few days .
well ...
i'll leave them here .
is there something wrong?
no , i don't think so .
come on , there's something wrong .
talk to me .
no .
why won't you give us a chance , kathy?
stop punishing yourself .
it's not it .
then what?
ok , fine .
i see him .
i hear him .
at times , i fell like i can almost touch him .
and then , there's all these signs .
what signs?
eights " , i see them constantly .
it's like he's trying to tell me something ... and i just can't figure it out .
what's happening to you is what grief is all about .
you miss jeremy so much that you're attaching emotional to what your mind is showing you .
you still don't understand .
trust me .
i've got to catch my plane .
contrary to popular belief , the most difficult aspect of is not so much the absence of the loved one ... is a sudden interruption of communication .
trouble?
i can't do it anymore .
the kids and i are leaving .
i want to leave me?
i think it's better .
mom , what are you doing here?
nothing .
i'm looking for marc .
is he around?
he went to the airport .
i can't believe you let him go .
why?
he's a good guy , there's nothing wrong with him .
do you think you're the only one who misses dad?
that's not fair .
then why mom?
why not marc?
you cant 'keep acting like this .
it's insane .
you got to let things get better .
you're right .
it's going to get better .
i have to go pick up the girls at isabel's .
i think that jeremy sent fergus to talk to you ... because he wanted to talk himself , but he couldn't .
he asked me to contact you ...
jeremy needs you to forgive him ...
why won't you gives a chance?
i'm sorry .
i just can't .
why not marc?
i can't believe you let him go .
he 'a good guy .
it's insane .
you got to let things get better .
alrport
passport and plane ticket , please .
thank you .
excuse me , just a moment .
give me 5 minutes , ok?
you can't keep acting like this .
i love you .
i know you can hear me now .
i'm sorry .
i'm so sorry .
i just wanted to give you a chance to live ... free of that anger and violence .
i love you .
i need you to do just one more thing for me .
even the dead need to be forgiven .
i need you to
please , forgive me .
i hated you for a long time , you know that .
i can't do it anymore .
i forgive you .
good to meet you in life , honey .
just be happy .
i forgive you .
the kids will be so happy to see you .
