who cares , anyhow?
not me .
wow !
you must think i'm some cheap date .
no , sir .
i don't know how you city folks work .

that's for damn sure .
you do make that cigarette look good .
you make that dress look good .
you're so sweet .
do i owe you anything?

it'll always be something with you , mike .
well , you know me .

you don't need to be coy , roy

hop on the bus , gus you don't need to discuss much
just drop off the key , lee and set yourself free
helicopter !
let's go !
ladies and gentlemen , elvis has left the building !
hang in there !
you're going to make it !
you're going to be okay , franklin !
i'm dying !
put pressure on it !
i'm dying , man !
i won't make it !
hang on !
help me !
is he gonna make it?
fuck him .
how you doing?
where is the pisser?
nice place you got here .
a real shit hole .
gus , give me a hand .
oh , yeah .
that's a lot of money .
$3 . 2 million . $3 . 2 million?
that's a beautiful thing .
less jack's 10 percent .
right .
damn .
that's a lot of money just to fly a helicopter .
would you rather we used a hot air balloon?
no .
or maybe hang gliders?
would you rather we used hang gliders?
i don't know what a hang glider is .
i doubt you know how to fly a fucking helicopter , either .
if you ask me , $320, 000 is well worth it .
besides , jack has taken care of a lot of shit ... ... you don't know anything about .
all right .
back to business .
where is franklin's pile?
what are you talking about?
franklin .
anybody remember him?
i was there .
franklin is dead .
right .
so , where is franklin's pile?
well , murph , we don't make him a pile .
we split up four ways .
wrong .
franklin's pile does not get split up .
sure , i'm good with that .
bullshit !
who gets the remaining 15 percent , then?
let me guess .
it was my deal , hanson .
no , i want that 15 percent split up four ways .
you want?
yeah , i want .
well , i could give a flying fuck what you want .
a deal is a deal .
let me put it this way .
that fucking deal died with franklin .
now , it's time to make a new deal .
that's a commitment , hanson .
i'll give you that .
fuck it .
we shot everybody in the casino , let's start shooting each other .
come on , you guys , let's just settle down , all right?
we don't need this .
gus is right .
let's just keep this simple .
i'll take my 15 percent , plus 25 percent of franklin's end , and i'll take it now .
i'm not letting that happen .
why the hell not?
because that would change the plan , and when plans change ... ... things get fucked up !
you'll have to learn to be more flexible .
the plan stays !
we have an arrangement in twin falls ... ... where we'll get 70 cents on the dollar .
we'll keep that arrangement .
all of us .
after that , i'm over the border into canada and you can all get on michael's boat ... ... for all i care .
no .
nobody gets on my boat but me .
right .
whatever .
if anyone goes before then , there's a chance you'll spend the money .
you spend the money , you'll get popped .
and the chances are you'll talk .
either way , i'm not taking that chance .
murph , i've been doing this a long time and i've never dropped dime on anybody .
want to keep blowing smoke in my face , or you want me to blow your head off?
you go do whatever it is you got to do in twin falls or wherever .
that's your criminal right .
me , i'm staying right here .
you both have hot sheets .
instead of traveling with you ... ... l should be putting as much distance from you as humanly possible .
traveling with you fucks is the weakest part of the plan .
but since we don't trust each other , we'll travel north together as a group .
so , try to think of us as the osmonds , only we don't fucking get along .
gentlemen , as far as i'm concerned , this job is done .
i'm cashing out .
just give me my fucking money .
is that an order?
no , come on , that wasn't an order .
i mean , technically it wasn't .
what about you , gus?
what?
you think this is your fucking money?
no , no .
this is my money .
that's your money .
michael .
i just want to get on the move , murph .
makes you the only fucking pig in the room , hanson .
you make me laugh , you know?
i can't imagine what goes through that sick mind of yours .
sometimes i actually think you believe you're the king himself .
what is it with those side burns?
i glued mine on for the job .
for you , it's an actual lifestyle choice .
shut up .
i'm serious !
shut up .
it's fucking sad , man .
nevertheless , i do know the golden rule .
and what's that , sweetheart?
fuck the gold .
he who has the nickel plating ... ... makes the rules .
you shot him !
that's right , gus .
now , i'm going to kill him .
sweetheart .
wrap him up .
wrap him up .
wrap him up !
fuck !
anybody?
no .
we need some towels !
he's bleeding all over the place .
hey , murph .
how are we going to split up the money now?
hey , this boy is heavy .
i think he had one too many peanut butter and fried banana sandwiches .
god !
need a ride , fella?
thanks .
fuck !
a raidas wild and as daring as anything seen on the american landscape .
the riviera hoteland casino exploded today in a shower of gunfire ... ... during the international elvis convention .
where's jesse?
come here , you little shit !
what the hell ....
where is it?
where is that damn money?
i don't know what you're talking about .
i'm calling the cops right now .
911 operator .
please state your name and location of the emergency .
yes , hello .
hello?
this is the 911 operator .
hello , ma 'am?
ma 'am?
i thought you might change your mind .
where did you get that?
you're the one .
the casino in vegas .
it's all over the news .
that's you .
get over there and sit down .
go .
that's $100, 000 in there .
just for you to keep your mouth shut .
you don't have to pay me off , i won't tell anybody .
no , you're not .
all i need is a couple of days .
after that , you can do whatever the hell you want .
everything is understood?
i got it .
well .
hey , elvis .
is there any chance that i might be able to see you again?
sorry , cybil .
are you 100 percent sure of that?
yeah , 100, 000 percent .
i need your car .
what?
yeah , the old valiant out there .
where are the keys?
i'm not giving that to you .
yeah , you are .
because i just gave you $100, 000 for it .
i don't care how much you just gave me .
anyway , it's not my car .
it's my grandmother's .
you either give me the keys right now  or what?
you're going to kill us?
you know , there is a simple solution here .
yeah , there is .
you can take us with you .
what?
why not?
where are you going?
i haven't got time for this .
you got three seconds to get me those keys ... ... or i'll splatter cherry pie on that wall behind you and ... ... l'm dead serious about that .
one , two ....
stop pointing that gun at my mom .
who's there?
it's the police .
can you open the door , please?
mom , money !
sit down .
sit down !
mom , get the door .
can i help you?
evening .
we received an emergency 91 1 call from this room .
are you sure?
yeah .
the call was disconnected .
we were in the neighborhood .
everything okay?
yeah , it's fine .
we were just fixing to leave .
can we come in , ma'am?
of course you can . ... elvis impersonators made it up the elevator and to the roof where they were ... ... taken by helicopter , we don't know where .
are you the man of the house?
we just got engaged .
congratulations .
thank you .
we're really excited about it .
we're about to go on a trip to the grand canyon .
jesse , why don't you go get your stuff?
okay .
well , i'll be right back .
so , which of you is the one who dialed 91 1?
i'm sorry .
i was trying to dial 41 1 for information and i dialed 9 by mistake .
well , i guess we're all set here .
we'll be on our way .
so are we .
come on .
ma'am , can i give you a hand with your bag?
if you wouldn't mind .
it's really heavy .
we got a lot of schoolbooks .
it would be my pleasure .
we'll be right there .
come on .
bye bye !
you guys are federal marshals?
if we're not , we'd better give these fuckers back .
good morning .
not for them it isn't .
'morning .
vegas homicide .
what do you got , vegas?
no ids .
looks like this one was digging , trying to bury the one in the sheet .
someone drilled them from the front .
double taps to the heart .
three spent . 45 casings , probably more in the sand .
and this is interesting . . 45 slug , slightly deformed .
vest .
tell me something , cybil .
how did that money get up there in that ceiling?
what do you mean?
jesse put it up there .
it's a little heavy for him to get up there all by himself .
you're so paranoid .
yeah , i'm paranoid , because i think you tried to steal my money .
you don't deserve the money , anyway .
you're just an amateur .
if you're such a pro , you know stealing it wouldn't have done you any good .
the money is marked , miss l got lt all figured out .
you're lying .
am l?
the news said the money was untraceable .
the news?
and the news doesn't lie .
i'm sure they said that .
that way , when the idiots who stole it try to spend it , they get caught .
you want to know why , cybil with a " c "?
because they were dumb shits and they listened to the news .
i never thought about it that way .
i guess not .
all right , here we go .
i'm pulling off here .
i can't drive anymore .
i got to sleep .
can i help you?
can you pump gas?
good , because nobody does anymore .
fill it up .
you all be cool now .
man , what happened to your nose?
what happened to your hair?
we just came from another interrogation .
which reminds me .
quig , why do they call it a head butt?
it's not like i knocked that prick out by slamming my forehead into his ass .
yeah , that's true .
i would have come forward sooner ... ... but i was busy getting my beak mended .
i heard about the robbery after the surgery .
i put two and two together and here i am , in the flesh .
i'll tell you what i told them other guys .
which is what?
i knew one of them .
you're certain of that?
he's a real crazy motherfucker , too .
he was ... ... sinister , you know?
some creepy , freaky , level9 type shit .
dark .
kind that's liable to shove a little snake up the coochies of women .
yeah , you better watch out for that one .
wherever he go , trouble bound to follow .
oh , my god !
is he dead?
jumper cables might help .
did it hurt?
that's a funny question .
well , did it?
i think maybe the first one did .
i could call the cops , you know .
you could try .
allow me .
need some spot welding done?
he's a real elvis impersonator?
no .
what does that mean?
remember when the king died in '77?
jesus , was it '77?
he had a clause in his will which stated that lisa marie ... ... along with any illegitimate child he may have fathered ... ... be entitled to his entire estate .
naturally .
that's when i first met him .
did " him " have a name?
yeah !
murphy .
thomas murphy .
where are you headed?
can i come?
can l?
go get your bubble gum .
smoke?
no .
but i do everything else .
it's a nasty habit .
our music , rock'n 'rollmusic is basically gospel or rhythm blues .
i did not try to steal your money !
