karl ruprecht kroenen .
born in munich , 1897 .
suffered from a masochistic compulsion ...
... commonly known as surgical addiction .
both eyelids surgically removed ... ... along with his upper ... ... and lower lip .
the blood in his veins dried up decades ago .
only dust remains .
what horrible will ...
... could keep such a creature as this alive?
and one of those cookies .
do you have any doughnuts?
sorry , pal .
how about a bear claw?
no .
he's determined , unstoppable .
some people would call that cocky .
he's just strong .
yeah .
that he is .
hey , i've got yours .
my uncle , he used to say we like people for their qualities ... ... but love them for their defects .
he loves you , you know .
what about you?
i don't know .
i grew up with him .
but now every time i see him , i get confused .
there's hardly a day that goes by that he's not in my mind .
even now ... ... i feel like he's here .
hey , wait up .
you like doughnuts?
i got two .
thanks .
that was nice .
i got a cookie , as well .
sugar?
no .
no sugar .
thank you .
no cream and sugar , moron .
she takes it black .
i got some milk here .
no .
i'm okay .
i don't take milk .
you're lucky .

she took his picture .
damn !
she took his picture .
she took his picture .
she took his picture .
oh , crap .
it's freezing , isn't it?
coffee's warming me up .
well , what do we do now?
newark , new jersey , entertainment capital of the world .
you sound like a game show host .
hi .
hey .
you're hellboy .
i'm on a mission .
all right , tell me something about you .
where do you come from?
i lived with my uncle most of my life .
then i went to quantico , went to top of my class .
i'm nothing like ...
don't tell anyone , huh?
attaboy .
sebastian plackba , number 16 .
moscow .
who wants us in moscow?
my mom baked them .
she's laughing .
she's sitting on a park bench , and she's laughing .
that's it .
i'm done .
they don't look like spies .
are you kidding me?
look at this guy .
those shady little eyes , that phony grin .
are you going to eat that?
no .
hey , he's yawning .
he's bored .
yeah , the old yawning trick .
watch his arm .
first he wants my job , then he wants my girl .
hey , we all have a side that we try to hide .
god ...
hey , what the hell?
hey !
hey , who threw that?
are you okay?
yeah , i'm fine .
nice shot .
sebastian plackba , number 16 .
it's rasputin's mausoleum .
it's rasputin's mausoleum .
i see the puppet .
but where is ... ... the puppeteer?
very good , professor broom .
it was you .
the scraps of paper ... ... liz's sudden relapse and return .
bread crumbs on the trail .
like in a fable .
they both distract him ... ... and guide him exactly where i need him .
moscow .
his destiny .
and the last clue ... ... will be left by the late professor broom .
you raised the child .
nurtured him .
so in return ... ... i will permit you ...
... a brief , brief glimpse of the future .
he will open the portal ... ... and bring about the end of the world .
if only you had had him destroyed 60 years ago ... ... none of this would have come to pass .
but then , how could you have known?
your god chooses to remain silent .
mine lives within me .
every time i died and crossed over ... ... a little more of the master ... ... came back with me .
he disclosed to me the child's true name .
would you like to know it?
i know what to call him .
i call him ...
... son .
i'm ready .
it'll be quick .
just go there and tell her how you feel .
my mom says that ...
look , it's not ...
it's not that easy , okay?
plus , you're 9 .
you're not old enough to be giving me advice .
all right , stand by .
who are those guys?
liz , i'm sorry .
it's broom .
let's go .
we need to find him .
no !
wait , what happened?
no !
it's okay .
no , not him .
would you take her?
something's wrong .
he hasn't spoken to anybody in three days .
not a word .
he won't eat , he won't sleep .
i've never seen him like this .
never .
should i stay?
with him , i mean?
listen , i'm not much of a problem solver .
three decades , i've only completed two sides .
but i do know this much .
if there's trouble ... ... all us freaks have is each other .
and i'm stuck here .
so ...
... take care of the big monkey for me , will you?
volokolamsk fields , 50 miles from moscow , that's where we're going .
sebastian plackba , number 16 .
that's the only clue we have .
we've collected and destroyed thousands of eggs ... ... but we have no trace of this sammael or this rasputin character .
we leave as soon as we get clearance and equipment .
hellboy's coming .
i'm not pleased about that , but i'll be in charge this time .
we either wrap this up or i'm closing this freak show for good .
hi .
hi .
i'll ... ... come to moscow ... ... if you're still going .
i am .
but i have something to say .
i understand what you don't like about me .
i do .
what i am ... ... makes you feel a little out of place ... ... out there .
red , i don't ...
listen .
i'm not like myers .
he makes you feel like you belong ...
... which is good , really .
i wish i could do something about this .
i can't .
one , i'll always look this good .
and two ... ... i'll never give up on you .
ever .
i like that .
one falls , two shall arise .
sammael .
we'll have to nail them all at once , and the eggs .
and when we do , no mumbo jumbo .
double core vulcan 65 grenades .
we've installed a handy little timer .
you set it , you walk away .
cable pulls the safety pins .
kaboom .
easy to clean , easy to use .
sparky to big red .
do you read me?
come in .
sparky "?
who came up with that?
myers?
yeah , we're leaving the main road , so hang on .
this better be the place or i'll puke .
you better come out and see .
sebastian plackba , number 16 .
forget it .
we're never gonna find rasputin's mausoleum .
now , what we do here is we make up a grid .
we go in by quadrants .
maybe satellite photography .
let me ask for directions .
what'd he say?
come on , baby , find me a talker .
hi there .
come on .
come on .
come on .
what do you want?
this is ridiculous .
i run this show , not him .
this guy's nothing but trouble .
anybody got a powerbar?
hey , there he is .
sixty feet further , comrades .
and three rows in .
what the hell is that on his back?
this here is ivan klimentovich .
say " hi , " ivan .
go that way , red monkey !
gotcha .
ivan says there's a whole network of tunnels down here .
goes on for miles .
stay close , everybody .
you better be right about this .
we'll be all right as long as we don't separate .
hey , sparky .
tell everyone to turn their locator belts on .
anybody sees anything ...
i'll say " marco .
polo .
are you sure about this?
two .
don't worry , boy scout , she'll take care of you .
she's a tough one .
come on .
ask your buddy how far this thing goes .
how you doing up there , ivan?
if i had legs i'd kick your ass !
would you mind holding this guy for a while?
he is so negative .
what the hell is that?
something big .
lime , come with me .
right .
no , no , no .
stay put !
stop !
you listen to me .
listen to me !
i'm in charge .
we're gonna go back .
you can take that door apart .
whatever it is , it's coming for us .
now , we gotta move forward !
lime , let's go !
stay put !
and you !
i am not afraid of you !
i'm in charge !
we go back !
i was better off dead !
oh , crap .
music .
really went deep .
hey , what's wrong with you? !
you killed my father .
your ass is mine .
what are you laughing at , you nazi son of a ...?
don't even think about it .
that's all for you , pinhead .
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
having a ...
you never light a cigar that way .
you use a wooden match .
preserves the flavor .
you see?
thank you .
thank you .
so he thinks you and i ...
that's why he's mad at me .
but it's not true , right?
what?
well , that , you know , you feel that way about me .
you want to know that here?
now?
yeah .
red , white , whatever .
guys are all the same .
hey , wait up .
have you found them yet?
i got them right below me .
it's a matter of minutes .
okay , good .
could you hurry up?
because it's a little spooky in here .
liz , wait .
oh , my god .
let's back out real slow .
let's back out real slow .
myers , ready your grenades .
marco .
marco .
marco .
get your big , red butt over here .
i'm coming for you , kid !
no piggybacks !
get off me , you ...
liz , no !
they're gonna kill him !
do something !
what do you want me to do?
hit me .
what?
hit me .
now !
you should be running .
they are all here .
all of them .
just the way it was promised .
this one's awake .
thank you for this .
and i looked ... ... and beheld an angel .
and in his right hand , the key to the bottomless pit .
these were the words i heard as a peasant boy in tobolsk .
and now , the door .
sent by the ogdru jahad ...
... so that they might at long last enter our world .
you are the key , the right hand of doom .
your stone hand .
what did you think it was made for?
open the locks .
don't do it , red !
don't do it !
silence .
imagine it .
an eden ... ... for you and her .
no .
no?
in exchange for her soul , then?
open the door .
no .
as you wish .
no !
liz !
her soul awaits on the other side .
if you want her back ...
... open the door and claim her .
your true name is inscribed around the locks that hold you .
you cannot break them ... ... no matter how strong you are .
the eclipse has begun .
your true name ...
... say it !
become the key .
for her .
anung un rama .
repeat it .
anung un rama .
open the final lock .
remember who you are !
believe me , i have lived long enough to know ... ... not a tear will be shed for this world !
you have a choice .
your father gave you that .
no , you don't !
open it !
do it !
what have you done?
i chose .
you will never fulfill your destiny .
you will never understand the power inside you .
i'll just have to find a way to live with that .
child .
look what you've done .
you've killed me ... ... an insignificant man .
but you have brought forth ...
... a god .
myers , let's go .
hell will hold no surprises for us .
i took a grenade belt .
the damn thing's broken .
keep her safe , will you?
whatever happens , don't leave her alone .
i won't .
you're okay , myers .
stick around .
hey , red .
just pull the cable .
i didn't get you anything .
are you going to be okay alone?
how big can it be?
damn !
damn .
oh , this is gonna hurt .
gonna be sore in the morning .
she's got no pulse .
she's not breathing .
liz?
i was so foolish .
red .
in the dark ...
... i heard your voice .
what did you say?
i said , " hey ... ... you on the other side ... ... let her go .
because for ...
for her i'll cross over .
and then you'll be sorry .
what makes a man a man?
a friend of mine once wondered .
is it his origins?
the way he comes to life?
i don't think so .
it's the choices he makes .
not how he starts things ...
... but how he decides to end them .
hey , guys?
i'm still here .
hello?
