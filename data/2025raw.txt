dad's on a hunting trip .
and he hasn't been homein a few days .
i sworei was done hunting .
i can't do this alone .

i think dad wants us to pick upwhere he left off saving people, hunting things .
no , i got to findjessica's killer .
okay , what do you think?
um ... oh , god . too martha stewart?

um ... i don't knowif this is really me .
lori , there's a hot chickburied somewhere in there .
okay , okay .
so?
damn , girl !
he's not gonna knowwhat hit him .
okay , i thinkhe's probably downstairs .
i'll see you later .
don't do anythingi wouldn't do .
there's nothingyou wouldn't do .
it's true .
i thought we weregoing to the party .
well , we can't arriveon time .
you know, if i didn't know any better ,
i'd think you brought me hereon purpose .
what?
i'm offended .
yeah , i'm sure .
do you want to get that?
definitely not .
no .
it's okay .
hey , i mean it .
what was that?
i don't know .
what is that?
rich , no !
just wait here .
what the hell?
rich , let's go .
aah !
aah !
rich?
rich?
rich , where are you?
okay .
okay .
all right .
thank you for your time .
your half caff double venti vanilla latte is getting cold over here , francis .
byte me .
so , anything?
i had them check the fbi's missing persons databank .
no " john does " fitting that description .
i even ran his plates for traffic violations .
i'm telling you , i don't think dad wants to be found .
check this out .
news item out of plains courier , ankeny , iowa .
it's about 100 miles from here .
mutilated body was found near the victim's car parked on 9 mile road .
keep reading .
authorities are unable to provide
a realistic description of the killer .
the sole eyewitness , whose name has been withheld , is quoted as saying the attacker was invisible .
could be something interesting .
it could be nothing .
one witness who didn't see anything doesn't mean it's the invisible man .
but what if it is?
dad would check it out .
why are we here?
victim lived here .
nice wheels .
we're your fraternity brothersfrom ohio .
we're new in town transfers .
looking for a place to stay .
who are you?
we're your new roommates .
do me a favor? get my back .
big game today .
he's the artist .
things he can dowith a brush ...
so ... murph , is it true?
what?
we heard one of the guys heregot killed last week .
yeah .
what happened?
they're saying some psychowith a knife , maybe a drifterpassing through .
rich was a good guy .
rich was with somebody?
not just somebody lori sorenson .
who's lori sorenson?
you missed a spotdown on the back .
lori's a freshman . she's a local .
super hot .
and get this she's a reverend's daughter .
you wouldn't happen to knowwhich church , would you?
our hearts go out to the familyof the young man who perished , and my personal prayersof thanks go out , as well , because i believe he diedtrying to protect my daughter .
and now , as time healsall our wounds , we should reflect onwhat this tragedy means to us as a church . h ...
. as a community, and as a family .
the loss of a young personis particularly tragic .
a life unlived is the saddestof passings .
so , please, let us pray for peace , for guidance , and for the powerto protect our children .
i can't. it's sunday night .
it's just us girls .
we're gonna do tequila shotsand watch " reality bites .
my dad makes dinnerevery sunday night .
come on , lori .
i know this has been hard , but you are allowedto have fun .
i'll try .
okay .
are you lori?
yeah .
my name is sam .
this is my brother , dean .
we just transferred hereto the university .
i saw you inside .
we don't want to bother you . we heard about what happened .
we wanted to sayhow sorry we were .
i kind of knowwhat you're going through .
i i saw someoneget hurt once .
it's somethingyou don't forget .
dad , this is sam and dean . they're new students .
it's a pleasure to meet you, sir .
i must say that wasan inspiring sermon .
thank you very much .
it's so niceto find young people who are opento the lord's message .
listen , we're new in town, actually , and we're looking for a ... tell me , lori, what are the police saying?
well , they don't have a lotto go on .
i think they blame mefor that .
what do you mean?
my story .
i was so scared, i guess i was seeing things .
that doesn't meanit wasn't real .
dean : so you believe her?
i do .
i think she's hot , too .
no , man , there's somethingin her eyes .
and listen to this .
she heard scratchingon the roof and found the bloody body suspended upside downover the car .
bloody body suspended? that sounds like the hookman legend .
that's one of the most famousurban legends .
you don't think that we'redealing with the hookman .
every urban legendhas a source , a place where it all began .
what about the scratchesand the tire punctures and the invisible killer?
maybe the hookmanisn't a man at all .
what if it's some kindof spirit?
here you go .
arrest recordsgoing back to 1851 .
thanks .
okay .
this is how you spent fourgood years of your life , huh?
welcome to higher education .
hey , check this out .
1862 a preacher named jacob karnswas arrested for murder .
he was so angry overthe red light district in town that one nighthe killed 13 prostitutes .
some of the deceasedwere found in their beds ,
sheets soaked with blood ,
others suspended upside downfrom the limbs of trees as a warning against sinsof the flesh .
get this the murder weapon?
looks like the preacherlost his hand in an accident , had it replacedwith a silver hook .
look whereall this happened .
9 mile road .
same place where the frat boywas killed .
nice job , dr .
venkman .
let's check it out .
i know this is your first timereally living alone since mom died .
that's not it . i worry about you .
there are 22 girls in there . i'm perfectly safe .
that's whatl'm worried about .
you don't think i knowwhat goes on in there?
dad , do we have to havethis argument again?
i'm over 18 . i can live my own life .
which means partyingwith that roommate of yours .
i'm an adult . i can take care of myself .
good night .
lori . lori , come
lori .
taylor , are you awake?
here you go .
if it is a spirit, buckshot won't do much good .
yeah .
rock salt .
hmm .
salt beinga spirit deterrent .
yeah .
it won't kill 'em, but it'll slow 'em down .
that's pretty good . you and dad think of this?
i told you , you don't have to be a collegegraduate to be a genius .
over there , over there .
put the gun down now ! now !
hands behind your head !
wait , wait , wait ! okay , okay .
get down on your knees ! come on , do it !
on your knees .
get down on your bellies . come on , do it .
he had the gun .
oh , my god !
saved your ass .
talked the sheriff downto a fine , dude .
i'm matlock . but how?
told him you werea dumb ass pledge and that we were hazing you .
what about the shotgun?
i said that you werehunting ghosts and that spiritsare repelled by rock salt .
you know, typical hell week prank .
and he believed you?
well , you look likea dumb ass pledge .
i just wantto take her home .
i understand , reverend , but lori's now connectedto two murders and i can't ignore that .
listen to me .
arrest her nowor let me take her home .
make sure she's availablefor questioning .
thank you .
why would the hookmanhave come here?
this is a long wayfrom 9 mile road .
maybe he's not hauntingthe scene of his crime .
maybe it's aboutsomething else .
dude , sorority girls .
think we'll seea naked pillow fight?
try and be quiet, will you?
me be quiet? you be quiet .
aren't you gladyou didn't turn on the light?
that's right outof the legend .
yeah , that's classic hookman, all right .
it's definitely a spirit .
yeah .
i've never smelled ozonethis strong before .
hey , come here .
does that look familiarto you?
it's the same symbol .
seems like it is the spiritof jacob karns .
let's findthe dude's grave , salt and burn the bones, and put him down .
after execution, jacob karns was laid to rest in old north cemeteryin an unmarked grave .
super .
okay , so, we know it's jacob karns , but we still don't knowwhere he'll manifest next .
or why .
i'll take a wild guessabout why .
i think your friend lorihas something to do with this .
you've been holding outon me .
this college thingis awesome !
this wasn't reallymy experience .
let me guess
library , studying, straight as .
what a geek .
did you do your homework?
yeah , it was bugging me .
how is the hookman tiedwith lori?
i think i came upwith something .
1932 " clergyman arrestedfor murder .
1967 " seminarian heldin hippie rampage .
there's a pattern here .
in both cases , the suspectwas a man of religion who openly preachedagainst immorality and then found himselfwanted for killings he claimed were the workof an invisible force , killings carried out get this with a sharp instrument .
what's the connectionto lori?
a man of religion who openlypreaches against immorality .
except this time insteadof saving the whole town , he's trying to savehis only daughter .
reverend sorenson .
do you thinkhe's summoning the spirit?
maybe .
or you knowhow a poltergeist can haunt a person insteadof a place?
the spirit latches onto thereverend's repressed emotions , feeds off them .
without the reverendever even knowing it .
either way , you should keepan eye on lori tonight .
what about you?
i'm gonna go see if i can findthat unmarked grave .
here we go .
that's it .
next time , i get to watchthe cute girl's house .
hello , preacher .
i saw you from upstairs .
what are you doing here?
i'm keeping an eyeon the place .
i was worried .
about me?
yeah , sorry .
no , it's cool .
i already called the cops .
no , seriously, i think you're sweet , which is probably whyyou should run away from me as fast as you can .
why would you say that?
it's like i'm cursedor something .
people around mekeep dying .
i thinki know how you feel .
goodbye , preacher .
no one willtalk to me anymore ... except you .
the sheriff thinksl'm a suspect .
and you knowwhat my dad will say?
pave faith .
what does he knowabout faith?
i heard you guysfighting before .
he's seeing a woman, a married woman .
i just found out .
she comes to our churchwith her husband ,
i know her kids , and he talks to me aboutreligion , about morality?
it's like on one hand, you know , just do what you wantand be happy , but he taught me raised me to believe thatif you do something wrong , you will get punished .
i just don't knowwhat to think anymore .
sam?
lori , i can't.
that someone you lost?
i'm sorry .
lori .
come inside , please .
i'll come inwhen i'm ready .
ack !
aah !
no !
no !
dad !
it's okay . it's all right .
it's okay .
it's okay .
we were just talking .
then lori's dad came out, and then he appeared .
a big man carryinga weapon , some kind of a hook?
yes , sir .
ever seen him before?
no , sir .
son , it seems every timei turn around , i'm seeing you .
i suggest you tryto stay out of trouble .
yes , sir .
it's all right . i'm with him .
that's my brother . hey , brother .
let him through .
thanks .
go ahead .
you okay?
yeah .
what the hell happened?
hookman .
you saw him?
damn right .
why didn't you torchthe bones?
i did .
are you sure it'sthe spirit of jacob karns?
sure as hell looked like him . and that's not all .
i don't think the spiritis latching onto the reverend .
yeah , the guy wouldn't sendthe hookman after himself .
i thinkit's latching onto lori .
last night she found outthat her father is having an affairwith a married woman .
so what?
so , she's upset about it .
she's upset aboutthe immorality of it .
she was raised to believe that if you do somethingwrong , you get punished .
okay , so shehe's conflicted , and the spiritof preacher karns is latching ontoher emotions and doingthe punishing for her .
right .
rich comes on too strong .
taylor tries to make herinto a party girl .
dad has an affair .
remind me not to pissthis girl off .
but i burned those bones . i buried them in salt .
why didn't that stop him?
you must've missedsomething .
no , i burned everythingin that coffin .
did you get the hook?
the hook?
it was the murder weapon , and in a wayit was part of him .
so , like the bones , the hook is a sourceof his power .
so , if we find the hook ... both : we stop the hookman .
here's something, i think .
logbook, iowa state penitentiary .
karns , jacob personal affects, disposition thereof .
does it mention the hook?
upon execution , all earthlyitems shall be remanded
to the prisoner's houseof worship , st .
barnabas church .
isn't that where lori'sfather preaches?
yeah .
where lori lives?
that's why the hookman'sbeen haunting reverends and reverends 'daughtersfor the past 200 years .
but if the hook were atthe church or lori's house , don't you think someonemight've seen it?
i mean , a blood stained, silver handled hook?
check the church records .
st. barnabas donations, 1862 .
received silver handled hook
from state penitentiary .
reforged .
they melted it down, made it into something else .
all right . we can't take any chances .
anything silvergoes in the fire .
i agree .
lori's still atthe hospital .
we'll have to break in .
all right, take your pick .
i'll take the house .
okay .
hey .
stay out of herunderwear drawer .
i got everythingthat even looks silver .
better safe than sorry .
move , move .
lori?
what are you doing here?
what is it?
i've been trying to understandwhat's been happening , why .
now i know , so i'm prayingfor forgiveness .
forgiveness for what?
don't you see?
i'm to blame for all this .
i've read in the bibleabout avenging angels .
trust me .
this guy he's no angel .
i was so angry atmy father .
part of me wanted himpunished , and then he cameand he punished him .
it's not your fault .
yes , it is .
i don't know how, but it is .
i killed rich .
taylor , too .
i nearly killed my father .
lori .
i can see it now .
they didn't deserveto be punished .
i do .
come on . we got to go .
go !
come on !
no !
come on , get up .
sam , drop !
i thoughtwe got all the silver .
why is he still here?
maybe we missed something .
lori , where did you getthat chain?
my father gave it to me .
where'd your dad get it?
it was a church heirloom . he gave it to me .
is it silver?
yes .
sam .
and you saw him , too, the man with the hook?
yes , i told you . we all saw him .
we fought him off, and then he ran .
and that's all?
yeah , that's all .
listen, you and your brother oh , don't worry . we're leaving town .
you gonna be okay?
yeah .
i still don't knowwhat happened , but i do knowyou saved my life .
my father's , too .
thank you .
we could stay .
