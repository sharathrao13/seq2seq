kenny ray carter , richmond high school all american , 1972 .
good to see you , sir .
i was really happy to see you in the stands tonight .
i have to tell you , sir , i haven't made up my mind yet .
as i've told you , it's time for me to step down .
last few years have been really tough .
well , losing's hard , sir .
this isn't about losing games , kenny .
i can't get them to show up for school , for practice .
i can't get parents involved , and i'm done chasing kids in the streets and pulling them into the gym .
yeah , it's a tough job .
richmond is a tough little city .
when i saw you here tonight , i thought , " i got him .
he's in .
well , actually , i was here for another reason .
my son plays for st. francis .
he does?
which kid was he?
well , you didn't see him .
he's a freshman .
he didn't play .
that's great .
great school .
what , you wanna go?
hey !
lyle , bring it !
let him go .
you think everybody's scared of you?
i ain't scared of you !
cruz , chill , man .
why you gotta be trying to act all hard all the time , man?
god , i'm sick of you , man !
you know , that school was rough when i went there .
it's way beyond that now .
well , then , just forget about it .
don't even discuss it again .
i can't quite do that .
coach officially offered me the job tonight .
the clock's ticking .
and when you say " offering job , " there's usually money involved .
yeah , there might be a thousand bucks in it for me .
for five months of work?
oh , well , you can't say no to that .
and the team , it's so bad .
those boys , they're so angry and undisciplined .
and besides , you know , you don't have the time .
you're trying to open up a second store .
exactly , i don't have the ...
hell , i don't have any time .
and you promised to take your girlfriend to mexico .
and i'm definitely keeping that promise .
there's no way i'm not going to mexico and hanging out on the beach with you in your bikini .
i can't take that job .
so when do you start?
you should've spoken to me first .
why?
it was a personal choice for me .
so , what happens to me?
you still gonna come to my games?
i'll probably miss most of your games , damien .
i'm sorry .
then i'll go to richmond and play for you .
no .
well , why not?
dad , you've always been my coach .
this is a great school , damien .
it puts you in a great position for college .
dad , i'm a freshman !
just because i'm coaching at richmond , it doesn't change our plans for your future , all right?
yo , my man , i need a vial , man .

the state only requires that they have a 2 . 0 average to play .
now , you got in here they need a 2 . 3 .
if you have a 2 . 0 , you have to score at least 1050 on the sat to be eligible for an athletic scholarship .
if you have a 2 . 3 , you only need 950 .
now , 2 . 3 is just a c plus .
it shouldn't be that hard to maintain a c plus .
these boys are student athletes .
student " comes first .
it says they gotta wear coat and ties on game days .
they don't own ties !
you gonna supply the ties?
there's a goodwill and a salvation army store
less than two blocks from here .
they got a box full of ties for 50 cents apiece .
yo , man , what you trying to say , huh?
oh , we too good to shop at the goodwill and salvation army , is that it?
yeah , i ain't that broke .
this is crazy !
a dress code and they have to sit in the front row in class?
this is basketball , man !
and basketball is a privilege , ma'am .
if you want to play basketball on this team , these are the simple rules you have to follow if you want to enjoy that privilege .
now , if you decide to follow these simple rules ,
i need you and the boys to sign this contract .
they can bring the contracts to practice tomorrow .
if you come to practice .
i wanna thank you all for coming out and showing your support , and i hope i have your support the rest of the season .
good night .
get up and leave like that?
look , i have a hard enough time getting my nephew to ...
how you gonna make them wear ties?
i want the other coach back !
it's one of your contracts , sir .
i've amended that contract .
you require your players to maintain a 2 . 3 grade point average .
i've committed to maintaining a 3 . 5 .
you require ten hours of community service , and i've committed to 50 .
any unexcused absences , any other disciplinary issues at school , you can nullify this agreement and send me to any school you want .
and how many days do i have to consider this offer?
none .
the second page is a letter you need to sign that confirms my withdrawal from st. francis .
they know i'm leaving .
what?
you withdrew from st. francis?
i called richmond .
they expect me there in the morning .
you called richmond?
you should have spoken to me about this .
it was a personal choice for me .
well , i can fix all that in the morning .
sir , please listen .
all i wanna do is play for you .
if i'm one of the top students at richmond ,
i mean one of the top in the whole school , and i have great sats ,
i can go to any college in the country .
i'm asking you to trust me .
you really wanna do this , huh?
okay .
part of growing up is making your own decisions and living with the consequences .
3 . 7 .
and you will earn every minute of playing time .
open it , please .
morning , sir .

now we have delilah .
she was my childhood sweetheart .
sir , was she hot?
oh , yes , sir .
she was steaming hot .
but she was the devil .
that girl was evil .
i remember once she tricked me into stealing brownies from christ the king first baptist church bake sale .
she smiled and got her way out of it , while i damn near had to wear a pillow on my butt for a month before i could sit down .
delilah , gentlemen .
she's our trap defense .
take notes , freshman .
this is as close as you gonna get to playing .
come on , come on .

what?
that's everybody .
come on .
that's a lot of free throws .
okay , mr. cruz .
before you can play on this team ... ... you owe me ... ... 2, 500 push ups ... ... and 1, 000 suicides .

mr. carter , how are the boys?
oh , they're great , ma'am .
we're 1 0 .
very good .
how may i help you?
well , i had my boys sign contracts requiring them to meet certain academic standards .
yes , i believe one of the faculty members mentioned that .
very interesting scare tactic .
well , in order for that to be successful ,
i need their teachers to fill out weekly progress reports so i'll know how the boys are doing in their classrooms .
okay .
well , i haven't received anything from their teachers .
i don't see how this ties in to your job as the basketball coach , mr. carter .
well , i took this job with the understanding i could do it my way .
and you can .
our next faculty meeting is in two weeks .
i'll remember to bring it up .
why , that would be great .
thank you , ma'am .
thank you , sir .

thank you , mr. worm .
look at that bow .
look at that .
i tied that .
i tied that shit .
can i get something on the bow?
let me get some .
are you crazy?
what is wrong with you?
what's wrong with all of you?
since when is winning not enough?
playing hard not enough?
no , you have to humiliate your opponent .
taunt him after every score .
you won four games last season .
four .
what gives you the right to taint the game that i love with trash talk and taunting?
what gives you the right to wear richmond on your chests and act like punks?
coach , they were jawing too .
so?
you can't show some class?
act like a champion?
you owe me 500 push ups apiece .
on the line .
now .
damn .
oh , man , come on .
listen , shorty , i'm just gonna be real with you , okay?
you're my girl .
i get out on that court and everything is just getting crazy , all i gotta do is just think about you .
mr. lyle .
why aren't you in ... ... geometry?
i'm going there right now , sir .
sir , this is betty .
bella .
bella .
bella .
this is bella , sir .
go to class .
don't forget that these projects are due at the end of this week .
so if any of you need extra time ...
excuse me , sir .
are you mr. gesek?
yes .
i ... ... don't see junior battle in this class .
junior battle is like a solar eclipse .
we rarely see him , but when we do , it's always special .
thank you .
surprise arrival to the poll is richmond high at 19th .
top 20 , baby .
we're 19th , dog .
the oilers have posted a perfect 9 0 mark , winning on the road against perennial powerhouses
xavier and baxter union .
junior , you should read the rest of this .
they blowing you up in this paper .
come on , man , read it .
man , you know he can't read .
man , shut up .
shut up , maddux .
richmond center has been big as the oilers are 'boyed . " '
buoyed .
the word is " buoyed .
buoyed by junior battle's 19 . 8 rebound a night numbers .
see , that's my big nigga right there , son .
hey .
if you was any bigger , you'd be my bigger nigga .
sit down .
sit down !
nigger " is a derogatory term used to insult our ancestors .
see , if a white man used it , you'd be ready to fight .
your using it teaches him to use it .
you're saying it's cool .
well , it's not cool .
and when you're around me , i don't wanna hear that shit .
we clear?
yes , sir .
yes , sir .
yes , sir .
yes , sir .
mr. worm , what is it you want out of this basketball season?
to win that state championship , sir .
well , who won the state basketball championship last season , lyle?
hell if i know , sir .
does anybody know?
okay .
what's your father do for a living , mr. lyle?
my father's in jail , sir .
well , i'm sorry to hear that , sir .
but that doesn't have to be your life .
i have four seniors on this team ,
junior , lyle , kenyon and worm .
all of whom i think can play basketball at the college level .
college .
that's a viable option for all of you .
but you have to perform in the classroom to have that chance .
you have to have a vision .
tell me , how do you see yourselves?
espn , baby .
that reminds me , mr. battle .
mr. gesek tells me he doesn't see you in his classroom very often .
yeah , we cool , though , me and him .
mr. gesek is a big basketball fan .
well , as of now , you're suspended .
oh , you can practice , but you can't play until mr. gesek tells me you're caught up in his class .
and that's a shout out to the rest of you .
you signed a contract .
you made a commitment .
now , i have your schedules and i'll be getting reports from your teachers .
if you don't perform in the classroom , you will not play .
what's up with that?
sit down , mr. battle .
all right , that's 500 push ups .
man , this is bullshit !
we won those games , not you .
that's 1, 000 push ups for mr. battle , clyde .
you wanna try for 2, 000?
young man , think about the choice you're making if you walk out that door .
to the baseline .
all right .
how about laquisha , if it's a girl .
laquisha?
okay , yeah , the ghetto called and they want they name back .
girl , laquisha?
be for real .
you might as well call the baby food stamp .
you're stupid .
all right , i was thinking i could call her harmony .
i like harmony .
harmony , oh , that's good .
i like that .
what did kenyon say?
please , he want a boy .
figures .
speaking of michael jordan ...
yo , what's wrong with a girl?
yeah , dog , boys grow into men , and men ain't worth the trouble .
don't you have someplace to go?
something to do?
guess he wants me all to himself .
see you later .
don't forget , i need your notes for history .
all right , i got you .
yeah .
see you later .
i bought us tickets to the dance .
why you telling these loudmouth girls about the baby?
now everybody's gonna know .
people are gonna know , kenyon .
it's not people's business , kyra .
why you jumping down my throat?
what's wrong with you?
look , me and coach been talking , and he thinks i can play college ball .
all right , so?
so how am i gonna do that and raise a baby?
i don't know .
i mean , i'm not saying it won't be hard .
hard?
it's already hard .
the kid ain't even here yet and i'm worried about how i'm gonna feed it , how i'm gonna pay for this and that .
everything .
i'm not ready .
so , what are you saying?
you want out?
is that what you're saying?
go ahead and say it .
look , if i wanted to be out , i would've been out by now , kyra .
that's not it at all .
i love you .
i wanna be with you .
yeah , as long as it's convenient .
i'm thinking about what's best for us .
you're not trying to think about what's best for both of us , you're thinking about what's best for you .
you don't want me to have this baby .
you wanna leave richmond .
you wanna go play college ball .
so guess what?
we ain't got to be ready enough for nothing , all right?
i'm ready enough to do what i gotta do all by my damn self .
so you can take these and go to the dance yourself .
progress reports?
you're the basketball coach .
look , ma'am , we talked about this .
i don't see what the problem is .
do you know what the api is , mr. carter?
no , i don't .
the academic performance index .
they judge schools on a scale of one to ten , ten being the best .
do you have any idea where richmond falls on that scale?
no , ma'am , i have no idea .
we're a one , mr. carter , and have been for the last seven years .
the state rewards schools for their performance .
so every year i have less money to pay faculty and staff .
look , ma'am ...
can i ask what it is you want?
i want my boys to go to college .
college?
mr. carter , richmond graduates 50 percent of its students , the higher percentage being girls .
now , in my very educated opinion , you have 15 players on your team , you'll be lucky to graduate five of them .
i'm sorry , ma'am , but i don't agree with you .
look , these boys signed contracts .
maybe if you'd read one of them ...
your job is to win basketball games , mr. carter .
i suggest you start doing your job .
and your job is to educate these kids .
i suggest you start doing yours .
well ... ... we had another good week .
yeah , business is very good , kenny .
but i'm on my own .
you're never here .
it gets crazy .
look , i appreciate everything you do .
and i promise you ...
we're closed .
as soon as the season is over , i will be here for you .
mr. carter?
i'm ...
junior battle's mother .
yes , ma'am , i remember you .
willa .
willa battle .
how may i help you , ma'am?
mr. carter , i got a phone call today from a coach at a junior college in sacramento .
now , they wanna see junior play this friday .
well , that's great , ma'am , but junior broke some rules ...
and i agree with them .
i'm not here to argue with your rules .
i'm not .
almost two years ago now ,
junior's older brother , anton , was ... ... killed , and it's been confusing and hard for me and for junior .
after you lose a son ... ... every time the phone rings , your heart stops .
now , i'm not asking for special attention .
i agree he needs to get straight with his classes .
but the idea of junior college had never even occurred to my son .
now , i could move to the hercules school district , and he could play there .
but moving is not gonna solve ...
but i want him to play for you .
look , i'm not gonna stand here and say i know how it feels to lose a son , because i don't .
and i do appreciate you putting your trust in me .
but i need to hear that from junior .
he in the car .
junior !
go on .
i'm sorry for what i said and did at practice , and i promise to get caught up with my classes , sir .
look me in the eye , sir .
everything inside me tells me if i take you back ,
i'd be making a mistake and you'll make a fool of me .
no , sir .
you owe me 1, 000 push ups and 1, 000 suicides before you can play .
i'll see you at practice tomorrow .
thank you , sir .
and you gonna do every last one of them .
quitting basketball like you pay rent .
i don't know who you think you are .
the next time you make a decision , you better ask me first .
yo , junior , you did your thing tonight , man .
good looking out , yo .
yeah , good shot , junior .
yeah , no doubt .
gentlemen , listen up .
i just received a call from the director of the bayhill holiday tournament .
you have been invited .
yeah !
yeah , baby !
now , i have more good news .
i spoke to principal garrison today .
she informs me that your teachers will have your academic progress reports prepared by the end of holiday break .
sir , our grades are tight , yo .
yo , not only are our grades all right , coach ,
but we undefeated , homeboy .
yeah !
<i>we undefeated we undefeated</ i>

it ain't even like that .
some girl just danced up on me .
that ain't shit .
whatever .
you shouldn't be here .
if you're serious about this , you need to check this bullshit .
because if not ...
if not , what , kenyon?
you wanna hold my hand through an abortion?
is that what you want?
i don't know what i want .
you so damn sure you wanna have this baby , why don't you tell me how it's gonna be .
everything's great , right?
your cousin is 19 with two kids already , kyra .
it's great?
it was great when we was getting down .
you ain't having no second thoughts about that .
you loved me when it came to that .
look , kyra , i can't tell you what to do , but i look around and i see exactly how i don't wanna live .
paycheck to paycheck?
dead end job?
you make it seem like everything's gonna be all good ,
like everything's so wonderful .
you don't care about me .
you just wanna go to college , play ball and forget about me .
kyra , that's not even how it is .
i don't care what you say .
i'm having this baby .
and then what?
you got everything figured out , right?
so tell me what comes next .
