the silver arrow for pittsburgh and chicago
leaving at one o'clock .
it's crazy how you can get yourself in a mess sometimes and not even be able to think about it with any sense , and yet not be able to think about anything else .
you get so you're no good for anything or anybody .
maybe it begins by taking life too serious .
anyway , i think that's the way it began for me , just before my fight with rodriguez , three days ago .
hello?
hello , davey .
what kept you?
how are you?
ok , but it's getting late .
i hate to wait around like this .
you better hop a cab .
i had some trouble with the car .
i'll meet you at the arena .
ok .
right .
bye .
you're doing all right for yourself .
what do you mean?
oh , he just lives in the building .
oh .
used to be a pretty good fighter .
a fighter?
sure .
he's fighting tonight , as a matter of fact .
we can watch him on the tv .
dear davey , we still haven't heard from you yet this month , and we wondered whether everything was still all right with you .
out here everything's about the same .
i still get into seattle every week and the ranch is prospering nicely .
last week i finally bought mr henderson's chestnut arabian stallion .
your aunt grace's arthritis is much better .
she can even take short rides on jumper now and then .
well , i guess that's all now , except that we miss you a lot , davey .
write soon .
love , uncle george and aunt grace .
... brings together two very game boys .
the youngster , undefeated in 22 professional encounters , kid rodriguez , and the veteran , davey gordon , who's emerged victorious in 88 fights , while losing nine and drawing two .
gordon's long career he's now 29 has been one long promise without fulfilment , at least thus far .
as hard a puncher as they come , a clever boxer , he's been plagued by a weak chin and the unlucky knack of being at his worst for the big ones .
and tonight is a big one indeed , with a title bout in the offing for the winner .
now let's take time out for a friendly word from our sponsor .
how often have you come home and wanted to feel the ...
one .
two .
three .
four .
five .
six .
seven .
eight .
one .
two .
three .
four .
five .
six .
seven .
eight .
tonight we may have seen ring history in the making , in the form of the young welterweight rodriguez and his impressive ko over the experienced campaigner gordon .
but , for gordon , tonight must come as a bitter pill .
he was to prove that his glass chin had been remade into sterner stuff , but , unfortunately for him , tonight again it was as fragile as ever .
it's a well known ring adage that too much education spoils a fighter .
hello?
mr davey gordon , please .
that's me .
just a moment .
your party is on the line .
hi , davey .
this is uncle george .
hey , uncle george .
how are you?
fine .
how are you?
we're all fine , too .
say , how would you like to take a vacation out here , spend a little time with us?
country's mighty nice this time of the year .
it's really nice of you to ask me out but ...
dave , we saw the fight on tv tonight .
so?
nothing .
we just saw it .
must have looked great .
well , these things happen .
i don't know what happened .
forget it .
you need a vacation , and we haven't seen you for two years .
why don't you make a reservation and come on out?
well , look , i don't know .
say , look , i feel a little dopey right now , george , but ... let me think about it .
i'll , uh ...
i'll call you .
wait .
you're not hurt , are you , dave?
no , no .
i'm just tired , that's all .
good .
let us know as soon as you can .
sure .
your aunt grace sends her love .
tell her the same from here .
ok .
as it stands now , you'll let us know when to expect you .
i certainly will .
thanks for calling .
it was nice hearing from you .
take care of yourself .
you , too .
good night .
good night , davey .
go on home , you lying bum !
you're a bum !
go on home , boy .
i don't ...
hey !
what's goin 'on in there?
there you go .
that's better .
look , if you don't mind me ... if you don't mind me asking you , what happened?
well , about an hour ago ...
well?
what do you want?
i'm sorry .
i really am sorry .
it doesn't matter now .
i said i'm sorry .
can't you forgive me?
no .
please .
gloria , please .
go away .
get out .
yeah , that figures to be .
all my life i've always spoiled the things that meant the most to me .
all my life .
i don't care .
i just want you to get out .
gloria , can't you understand?
if only you could know how low and worthless i feel .
i didn't even know you had any feelings .
you foolish girl .
i'm mad about you .
i wanna get you outta here .
i'll set you up right .
i'll be your slave all my life .
you couldn't do anything for me .
don't forgive me , just tolerate me ,
and let me suffer , knowing how you feel .
can't you get it , vinnie?
to me you're just an old man .
you smell bad .
i'm mad about you .
i can't stand when i see those guys dancing with you .
my insides burst .
well , you won't have to see it any more .
please .
please , just another chance .
no .
no chance , no nothing .
please .
let go of me or i'll scream .
don't think about it any more .
why , he won't come back .
don't worry .
i'm so tired now .
just close your eyes .
don't worry about anything .
i'll sit here with you .
i locked her door and went home .
but first thing in the morning i went back to see how she was .
my knocking woke her up , but she was all smiles and invited me in for breakfast .
over coffee she told me she had seen the fight .
i suppose that got me started talking about myself , about what a washup i was , how i was going back to seattle and work on my uncle's ranch .
but when i think back about it now
i realise that , all the time i was talking , the thing that was really in my mind was to remember not to ask what it was her boss rappalo was so sorry for .
anyway , let's talk about you .
like , who are those people in the picture?
and how did you get messed up with that dance hall guy?
what's the matter?
nothing .
just that ... so funny you should ask those questions that way .
together that way .
why?
well , they have both so much to do with each other .
how do you mean?
it's involved .
do you wanna hear it?
if you don't mind telling me , i would .
i don't mind .
for some reason i feel like telling you .
i've never told anybody before .
this is my father .
this is my sister iris .
but i suppose it's really iris's story .
she was a ballet dancer , and everyone said she was very good .
she adored daddy , and of course she was his favourite .
but let me start from the beginning .
iris was eight years old .
father was a writer with a growing reputation , and mother was very beautiful and very intelligent .
they loved each other very much and they were very happy .
then i was born and my mother died on the same day .
they say father went on a two week drunk to celebrate the event .
and after that i don't think he ever thought of another woman .
time passed and iris grew more beautiful each day .
she was the image of her mother .
everyone said so .
iris was daddy's favourite , and i was very jealous .
and maybe i began to hate her .
daddy was good to me .
maybe he loved me a little , too .
by the time she was 20 , she was dancing with the ballets russes , and daddy was so proud of her .
and then i remember the day clearly it was my thirteenth birthday ,
sunday afternoon .
iris came home excited and told us of her marriage proposal .
the man wasn't bad looking , in his early thirties , and very rich .
father knew him and liked him , but he couldn't stop laughing when iris told how she said no , simply because the fellow wanted her to give up her dancing and just be his wife .
she never said if she loved him or not .
then , a few months later , daddy took sick and didn't get better .
and it turned out that he never would , and that he would need constant medical care until the end .
six months to two years , they said .
iris's salary wasn't enough , and in two months 'time all our savings were gone .
i couldn't work .
i was only 1 3 , still in grade school .
the next thing i knew , she married her rich suitor , and we were all living in great style on his estate in long island .
daddy had the best care money could buy , and he seemed happy despite it all .
iris gave up her dancing , according to the marriage bargain , and did little else but sit at daddy's bedside .
sick as he was , he always laughed a lot when they were together .
i guess i hated her more than ever now .
a year passed like that .
her husband was a sweet man , but none of us paid much attention to him .
and by then i'm sure he knew she didn't love him .
but he never said anything .
then one cold winter morning the maid woke us and said that daddy was dead .
iris was like a stone .
she didn't even blink .
i began to cry and shout that i hated her , that she had only pretended with daddy , and that she didn't ever love him .
she didn't say a word .
in his room she stood quietly over his body for a long time and smiled .
then she went up to her room and put on their favourite record .
it was from one of her ballets .
she played it very loud .
a short time later her husband found her in bed , the covers drawn up to her neck .
she'd cut her wrists and she was dead .
she left me a note .
said she loved me .
she was sorry for making a mess of everything between us .
later , i was in the city attending to some legal things , and i happened to pass the dance hall .
sign read " pleasureland .
dancing partners wanted .
i don't know what possessed me .
i went up .
i actually took the job .
i don't understand any part of it .
every night i worked in that depraved place , a human zoo .
i kept thinking " at least iris never had ... had to dance like this .
and then i started to feel less unhappy .
come on , let's go out for a walk .
we went out for a walk .
i bought her an ice cream and saw her laugh for the first time .
we must have walked for hours , and slowly her mood changed .
she became very happy and optimistic about life in general .
but when i said i was taking the train back to seattle the next day , she got serious again and very quiet .
i didn't know it , but i was already in over my head and i couldn't have cared less .
we didn't get back until after lunch .
and then in her apartment ...
something's happened .
i know .
do you know?
sure .
you kissed me .
is that all?
that's all i saw .
i watched all the time .
i love you .
love me?
that's funny .
why is it so funny?
why?
it's a mistake to confuse pity with love .
look , gloria ...
looking back now , i don't know what her reasons were then , but she agreed to come out to seattle with me .
i should have had sense enough to know it was no good , and she was so scared she'd grab at anything .
but i was kidding myself , and all i could think of was how much i wanted her .
we made reservations and wired uncle george to brace himself for a niece .
and then we got our finances together .
yes?
this is louie .
gloria price called to say she's coming in tonight for last week's salary .
you there , mr rappalo?
thanks .
albert?
hello , davey .
how are you?
ok .
have you got enough money on you to cash my cheque from yesterday?
what's the rush?
i don't feel too good .
i think i'll go out to seattle and take stock of things .
wait a minute , i'll see .
thanks .
i'd appreciate it .
ok .
come on over .
say , how about , uh ...
pleasureland instead?
you know , that dance hall at 49th and broadway .
maybe around eight tonight .
i'll be there , but it has to be 8 . 1 5 .
i'm taking my wife to a show .
i'll just make it .
right .
i'll see you there .
take it easy .
ok .
still feel the same way?
yes .
i understand you're going away .
yes .
where?
that's my business .
i came for my pay .
oh , sure .
how much do i owe you?
a week .
can't you tell me where you're going?
no .
will i ever see you again?
i doubt it .
i couldn't take that .
you'll have to .
that's not true .
why isn't it?
i could kill you right here and now .
oh , i don't think you will .
i wouldn't be too sure of that .
look , vinnie , i ...
i really am in a hurry .
for what?
somebody's waiting downstairs .
you going away with him?
i don't have to tell you anything .
all the same , you are , aren't you?
you figure it out .
then you are .
no comment .
he's a bum .
you'll be grubbing for him .
is that so?
sure .
like the man said , " can happiness buy money?
well , you're a comedian , too .
see what i'm missing?
get out .
i'm not asking for favours , but you owe it to me .
get out !
hey .
hey .
come on , give me back the scarf .
come on .
come on .
hey .
hey !
miss?
the boss says he's sorry and if you go upstairs you can collect your money .
what do you guys want?
who are you?
here .
do you want my money?
here , take it .
where did you go?
after my scarf .
did you get the money?
he said no , then gave me an extra hundred .
weird .
did you see albert?
somebody was here before .
i guess he got tired of waiting .
we'll call him when he gets home .
we had ham and eggs and said goodbye to the bright lights .
downstairs in the courtyard i suggested that we each get packed and i'd come over when i was through .
open the door .
open the door !
looks like he's gone .
know where?
no , sir .
where's he from?
i don't know .
when did he leave?
i don't know .
how long's he lived here?
oh , about a year .
give me a hand with this drawer .
yes , sir .
what kind of trouble is he in?
bad trouble .
found his manager's body an hour ago with his head bashed in .
ok .
let's go .
good morning , mr rappalo .
i'm sorry i missed you at the arena last week , but ...
anyway , mr albert told me to tell you that ...
that was my manager you knocked off .
what?
where is she?
what?
the girl !
i don't know .
you don't know .
i'm gonna count to three , and if you still don't know i'll blow your brains out .
one .
two .
a loft on 24th street .
how'd she get there?
boys were waiting .
she all right?
yeah , she's all right .
i had to do it .
she saw the boys at the dance hall .
she was a witness .
i thought you were dead .
they grabbed her and made it look like she'd left .
i thought you were dead .
i didn't want murder .
it's all gone wrong .
get goin '.
get 'em up .
is that you , mr rappalo?
yes , it's me , boys .
up !
everybody up .
against the wall and lean on your hands .
come on .
how are you , baby?
i'm ok .
i can't get the rope .
be careful .
you .
yeah , you .
untie her .
listen , vinnie .
don't kill me .
i don't wanna die .
i'll do anything you say .
anything .
you love him , though , don't you?
i don't know .
i don't think so .
i've only known him two days .
two days !
please , vinnie .
please don't kill me .
you said you were mad about me .
remember?
i'm just an old man and i smell bad .
remember?
i didn't mean it .
you know i didn't mean it .
we could go away .
sure .
sure .
i got lots of money .
we could have loads of fun someplace .
sure .
london .
paris .
sicily .
i'll do anything you want .
maybe we could get married .
settle down , have a couple of kids .
sure .
what do you take me for?
1 4 carat sucker?
you and lover boy won't put me in the hot seat .
you liked me once .
remember?
remember how nice it was?
it could be like that again .
you're forgetting about him?
i don't care .
you could have had anything , but you were too good for me .
so you come up to my office and get me mad .
i send the boys to work over lover boy .
they grab the wrong guy .
he bangs his head too hard on the sidewalk .
that makes me the sucker?
not on your life , baby .
not on your life .
hey !
don't shoot .
c'mon .
stay with her .
go ahead !
he went down there .
be careful .
it's a dead end alley .
he'll never get out .
look out !
get that down .
c'mon , hurry .
oh !
oh .
what's the matter?
my leg .
come on !
i can't .
i got him .
i gotta get outta here .
i don't see anything .
do you , joe?
let's go up and have a look anyway .
when the cops came i took them to free gloria .
the guy on the roof was picked up later .
on the ride to the police station gloria didn't say much .
i guess she was trying to work out in her own mind why i ran and left her alone .
i don't suppose she thought how i felt , listening to her talk to rappalo that way .
at the station they separated us for questioning .
five hours later they chalked off rappalo as self defence and had worked a confession from the hoods on albert's murder .
i was free .
on my way out , the desk sergeant said gloria had left an hour before .
there was no message for me , and i haven't heard from her or seen her since .
and now i don't suppose i ever will again .
anyway , i guess the whole thing was pretty silly . : know a girl for two days and fall in love .
so i cashed my cheque , sent flowers to albert's widow , cleaned up , and here i am .
