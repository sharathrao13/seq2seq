my lord .
gandalf the grey is coming .
a herald of woe .
the courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late ... ... thoden king .
he is not welcome .
why should i welcome you ... ... gandalf , gandalf stormcrow?
a just question my lord .
late is the hour ... ... in which this conjurer chooses to appear .
lathspell spell i name him .
ill news is an ill guest .
silence !
keep your forked tongue behind your teeth .
i have not come here to bandy words ... ... with a witless worm .
your staff .
i told you to take the wizard's staff !
thoden ... ... son of thengel ... ... too long have you sat in shadows .
i would stay still ... ... if i were you !
i will release you ... ... from the spell .
you have no powers here ... ... gandalf the grey
i shall draw you , saruman , as poison is drawn from a wound .
wait .
if i go , thoden dies .
you did not kill me ... ... you will not kill him .
rohan is mine !
be gone !
i know your face .
owyn .
owyn !
gandalf?
breathe the free air again , my friend .
dark my dreams have been of late .
your fingers would remember their old strength better ... ... if they grasped your sword .
i've only ever ... ... served you my lord .
your witchcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast !
send me not from your side !
no my lord !
let him go .
enough blood has been spilled on his account .
get out of my way !
hail , thoden , king !
where is thodred?
where is my son?
simbelmyne .
ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebears .
now it shall cover the grave of my son .
at last , that these evil days shall be mine .
the young perish and the old linger .
that i should live ... ... to see the last days of my house .
thodred's death was not of your making .
no parent should have to bury their child .
he was strong in life .
his spirits will find his way to the halls of your fathers .
they had no warning .
they were unarmed .
now the wildmen are moving through westfold .
burning as they go , every rick and cot .
where's momma?
this is but a taste of the terror that saruman will unleash .
all the more potent for he is driven mad by the fear of sauron .
ride out and meet him head on .
draw him away from the women and children .
you must fight !
you have two thousand good men riding north as we speak .
omer is loyal to you .
his men will return and fight for their king .
they will be three hundred leagues from here by now .
omer cannot help us .
i know what is that you want of me .
but i would not bring further death to my people .
i will not risk open war .
open war is upon you , whether you would risk it or not .
when last i looked ... ...
thoden , not aragorn , was king of rohan .
then what is the king's decision?
by order of the king ... ... the city must empty .
we make for the refuge of helm's deep .
do not burden yourself with treasures .
take only what provisions you need .
helm's deep !
they flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight .
who will defend them if not their king?
he is only doing what he thinks is best for his people
helm's deep has saved them in the past .
there is no way out of that of ravine .
thoden is walking into a trap .
he thinks he is leading them to safety .
but what he'll get is a massacre .
thoden has a strong hold but i fear for him .
i fear for the survival of rohan .
he will need you before the end there , aragorn
the people of rohan will need you .
the defenses have to hold .
they will hold .
the grey pilgrim .
that is what they used to call me .
three hundred lives of men have walked this earth and now , i have no time .
good luck .
my search will not be in vain .
look to my coming .
at first light of the fifth day ... ... at dawn , look to the east .
go .
you have some skill with a blade .
women of this country learned long ago that those ... ... without swords may still die upon them .
i fear neither death nor pain .
what do you fear my lady?
a cage .
to stay behind bars until use and old age accept them .
and all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire .
you are a daughter of kings .
a shieldmaiden of rohan .
i do not think that will be your fate .
thoden will not stay at edoras .
it is vulnerable .
he knows this .
he will expect an attack on the city .
they will flee to helm's deep ... ... the great fortress of rohan .
it is a dangerous road to take through the mountains .
it will be slow .
they will have women and children with them .
send out your warg riders .
hey stinker !
don't go getting too far ahead !
why do you do that?
what?
call him names .
run him down all the time .
because .
'cause that's what he is , mr. frodo .
there's naught left in 'im but lies and deceit .
it's the ring he wants .
it's all he cares about .
you have no idea what it did to him .
what is still doing to him .
i want to help him sam .
why?
because i have to believe he could come back .
you can't save him , mr. frodo .
what do you know about it?
nothing !
i'm sorry sam .
i don't know why i said that .
i do .
it's the ring .
you can't take your eyes off it .
i've seen you .
you're not eating .
you barely sleep .
it's taking a hold of you mr frodo .
you have to fight it .
i know what i have to do sam .
the ring was entrusted to me
it's my task !
mine !
my own !
can't you hear yourself?
don't you know who you sound like?
we want it .
we need it .
must have the precious .
they stole it from us .
sneaky little hobbitses .
wicked , tricky , filth !
no !
no !
master .
yes .
precious first .
they will cheat you , hurt you , lie !
master's my friend .
you don't have any friends .
nobody likes you .
not listening .
not listening .
youre a liar , and a thief .
no .
murderer !
go away !
go away?
i hate you .
i hate you .
where would you be without me?
gollum !
gollum !
i saved us .
it was me .
we survived because of me .
not anymore .
what did you say?
master looks after us now .
we don't need you .
what?
leave now ... ... and never come back .
no !
leave now and never come back !
leave now and never come back !
we told him to go away !
and away he goes , precious .
gone , gone , gone !
smagol is free !
look !
look !
see what smagol finds !
they are young !
they are tender and nice .
yes they are !
eat them .
eat them !
make him sick you will ... ... behaving like that
there's only one way to eat a brace of coneys .
whats he doing !
stupid fat hobbit !
you ruin it !
whats to ruin?
there's hardly any meat on them .
what we need it a few good taters .
what's taters , precious?
what's taters?
po ta toes !
boil them , mash them , stick them in a stew .
lovely big golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish .
even you couldn't say no to that .
oh yes we could .
spoiling nice fish !
give it to us raw ... ... and wriggling .
you keep nasty chips !
you're hopeless .
mr frodo?
who are they?
wicked men .
servants of sauron .
they are called to mordor .
the dark one is gathering all armies to him .
it won't be long now .
it will soon be ready .
ready to do what?
to make his war
the last war that will cover all the world in shadow .
we've got to keep moving .
come on sam .
mr. frodo !
look !
it's an oliphant !
no one at home will believe this .
smagol?
we've lingered here for too long .
come on sam !
ah !
bind their hands .
it's true you don't see many dwarf women .
and in fact , they are so alike in voice and appearance ... .. they are often mistaken for dwarf men .
it's the beards .
and this in turn has given rise ... ... to the belief that there are no dwarf women .
and the dwarves just , spring out of holes in the ground !
which is of course ridiculous .
it's alright !
it's alright !
nobody panic .
that was deliberate .
it was deliberate .
the light of the evenstar does not wax and wane .
it is mine to give to whom i will .
like my heart .
go to sleep .
i am alseep .
this is a dream .
then it is a good dream .
sleep .
you told me once ... ... this day would come .
this is not the end .
it is the beginning .
you must go with frodo .
that is your path .
my path is hidden from me .
it is already laid before your feet .
you cannot falter now .
arwen .
if you trust nothing else ... ... trust this ... ... trust us .
where is she?
the woman who gave you that jewel?
our time here is ending .
arwen's time is ending .
let her go .
let her take the ship into the west .
let her bear away her love for you to the undying lands ... ... there to be ever green .
but never more than a memory .
i will not leave my daughter here to die .
she stays because she still has hope .
she stays for you .
she belongs with her people .
you have a chance for another life ... ... away from war , grief ... despair .
why are you saying this?
i'm mortal .
you are elfkind .
it was a dream arwen .
nothing more .
this belongs to you .
it was a gift .
keep it .
my lord?
she is sailing to the undying lands , with all that is left of her kin .
what is it?
hama?
i'm not sure .
a scout !
what is it?
what do you see?
wargs !
we are under attack !
all riders to the head of the column !
come on , get me up here .
i'm a rider !
you must lead the people to helm's deep and make haste .
i can fight !
no !
you must do this .
for me .
follow me !
forward , forward , march forward .
make for the lower ground .
stick together !
bring your pretty face to my axe !
that one counts as mine !
stinking creature !
aragorn !
where is he?
speak up !
seems like your friend took ...
... a little thumble off the cliff .
you lie !
get the wounded on horses .
the wolfs of isengard will return .
leave the dead .
come .
finally !
helmsdeep !
there it is , helmsdeep !
we're saved , my lady !
thank you !
make way for the king !
make way for the king !
so few ...
so few of you have returned .
our people are safe .
we have paid for it with many lives .
my lady .
lord aragorn ... ... where is he?
he fell .
draw all our forces behind the wall .
bar the gate ... ... and set a watch on the surround .
what of those who cannot fight my lord?
the women and children?
get them into the caves .
saruman's arm would have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here .
helm's deep has but one weakness .
it's outer wall is solid rock for ... ... for except for a small culvert in space ... ... which is little more than a drain .
how?
how can fire undo stone?
what kind of device can break down a wall?
if the wall is breached , helm's deep will fall .
even if it is breached , it would take a number ... ... beyond reckoning , thousands to storm the keep .
tens of thousands .
but , my lord , there is no such force .
a new power is rising .
it's victory is at hand .
this night ... ... the land will be stained with the blood of rohan !
march to helm's deep !
leave none alive !
to war !
there will be no dawn for men .
look !
the smoke to the south !
there is always smoke rising up ... ... from isengard these days .
isengard?
there was a time ... ... when saruman would walk in my woods .
but now , he has a mind of metal ... ... and wheels .
he no longer cares for growing things .
what is it?
it's saruman's army !
the war has started .
may the grace of the valar protect you .
arwen .
it is time .
the ships are leaving for valinor .
go now before it is too late .
i've made my choice .
he is not coming back .
why do you linger when there is no hope?
there is still hope .
if aragorn survives this war , you will still be parted .
if sauron is defeated and aragorn made king ... ... and all that you hoped for comes true ... ... you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality ...
whether by the sword or the slow decay of time .... ...
aragorn will die .
and there will be no comfort for you .
no comfort to ease the pain of his passing .
he will come to death .
an image of the splendor of the kings ... ... of men in glory , undimmed before the breaking of the world .
but you , my daughter ... ... you will linger on in darkness and in doubt ...
as night falling winter has come without a star .
here you will dwell ... ... bound to you grief , under the fading trees ... ... until all the world has changed ... ... and the long years of your life are utterly spent .
arwen .
there is nothing for you here ... ... only death .
do i not also have your love?
you have my love father .
the power of the enemy is growing .
sauron will use his puppet saruman ... ... to destroy the people of rohan .
isengard ... ... has been unleashed .
the eye of sauron now turns to gondor ... ... the last free kingdom of men .
his war on this country will come swiftly .
he senses the ring is close .
the strength of the ringbearer is failing .
in his heart , frodo begins to understand .
the quest will claim his life .
you know this .
you have foreseen it .
it is the risk we all took .
in the gathering dark , the will of the ring grows strong .
it works hard now to find its way back into the hands of men .
men , who are so easily seduced by its power .
the young captain of gondor has but to extend his hand ... ... to take the ring for his own and the world will fall .
he is close now .
so close to achieving his goal .
for sauron will have dominion over all life on this earth ... ... even until the ending of the world .
the time of the elves ... ... is over .
do we leave middle earth to this fate?
do we let them stand alone?
what news?
our scouts report saruman has attacked rohan .
thoden s people have fled to helm s deep .
but we must look to our own borders .
faramir , orcs are on the move .
sauron is marshalling an army .
easterlings and southrons are passing through the black gate .
how many?
some thousands .
more come every day .
who s covering the river to the north?
we pulled five hundred men out of osgiliath .
but if the city is attacked , we won t hold it .
saruman attacks from isengard .
sauron from mordor .
the fight will come to men on both fronts .
gondor is weak .
sauron will strike us soon .
and he will strike hard .
he knows now we do not have the strength to repel him .
my men tell me that you are orc spies .
spies !
now wait just a minute !
well if you re not spies , then who are you?
speak !
we are hobbits of the shire .
frodo baggins is my name and this is samwise gamgee .
your bodyguard?
his gardener .
and where is your skulking friend?
that gangrel creature .
he had an ill favoured look .
there was no other .
we set out from rivendell with seven companions .
one we lost in moria .
two were my kin .
a dwarf there was also .
and an elf .
and two men ... ...
aragorn , son of arathorn and boromir of gondor .
you were friend of boromir?
yes .
for my part .
it would grieve you then to learn that he is dead?
dead?
how?
when?
as one of his companions , i had hoped you would tell me .
he was my brother .
captain faramir !
we found it .
you must come with me .
now .
down there .
to enter the forbidden pool bears the penalty of death .
they wait for my command .
shall they shoot?
rock and pool is nice and cool .
so juicy sweet .
i only wish to catch a fish !
so juicy sweet !
wait .
this creature is bound to me .
and i to him .
he is our guide
please ... ... let me go down to him .
smagol !
come , smagol !
trust master .
come !
we must ... go now?
smagol , you must trust master .
follow me , come on .
come .
come , smagol .
nice smagol .
that s it .
come on .
don t hurt him !
smagol don t struggle !
smagol listen to me !
master !
where are you leading them?
answer me !
smagol?
why do you cry , smagol?
cruel men hurt us .
master tricked us .
of course he did .
i told you he was tricky .
i told you he was false .
master is our friend ... our friend .
master betrayed us !
no , not it s business .
leave us alone .
filthy little hobbits !
they stole it from us !
no ... no .
what did they steal?
my precious !
we have to get out of here .
you go .
go now .
you can do it .
use the ring , mr. frodo .
just this once .
put it on .
disappear .
i can t .
you were right , sam .
you tried to tell me .
i m sorry .
the ring s taking me , sam .
if i put it on ... ...
he il find me .
he il see .
mr. frodo ...
so ... this is the answer to all the riddles .
here in the wild i have you .
two haflings ... ... and a host of men at my call .
and the ring of power within my grasp .
a chance for faramir , captain of gondor ... ... to show his quality .
no !
stop it !
leave him alone !
don t you understand?
he s got to destroy it !
that s where we re going .
to mordor .
to the mountain of fire .
osgiliath is under attack .
they call for reinforcements .
please .
it s such a burden .
will you not help him?
capitain?
prepare to leave .
the ring will go to gondor .
he's alive !
where is he?
get out of my way !
i'm gonna kill him !
you are the the luckiest , the cunningest ... ... and most reckless man i ever knew !
bless you , laddie !
gimli , where is the king?
you re late .
you look terrible .
a great host , you say?
all isengard is emptied .
how many?
ten thousand strong at least .
ten thousand?
to destroy the world of men .
they will be here by nightfall .
let them come .
i want every man and strong lad able to bear arms ... ... to be ready for battle by nightfall .
we will cover the causeway and the gate from above .
no army has ever breached the deeping wall ... ... or set foot inside the hornburg !
this is no rabble of mindless orcs !
these are uruk hai .
their armor is thick and their shields broad .
i have fought many wars , master dwarf .
i know how to defend my own keep .
they will break upon this fortress like water on rock .
saruman s hordes will pillage and burn .
we ve seen it before .
