it's all on you , linus .

because i have a whole network  get out of my car .
thank you .
mr. bloom?

your business manager said you would understand .

mr. benedict .

terry benedict . old terry .
she's looking at me from across the room .
and she's crazy about me , i can tell ... ... because she's been staring at me all night .
so suddenly ... ... i just go up to her , and i grab her .
and i've got her really close to me ... ... and her eyes are all fiery .
and my eyes are fiery .
and it's like it's electric .
and i say to her , " mom ....
mother ....
what?
thanks for ietting me finish .
what can i say?
you're a funny guy .
oh , yeah .
my friend rusty .
i'm worried about him . he owns this hotel in los angeles ... ... iosing a iot of money , and he's got no llfe . he's a nice , bright kid , but he's beating his brains out .
do you think i could send something through you , like , a message to him?
i read your palm , not his .
somebody who could do that could do very well .
anything on my health?
my hips are bothering me .
please .
this?
you couldn't see this?
i tried knocking , he won't open .
i'll handle it .
i know him .
jesus christ , are you people retarded?
it says , " do not disturb " !
it's me .
hey .
come on in .
jeez , topher , you didn't have to go all frankie muniz on me .
i'm sorry .
rust , look , i know this is your joint .
i just ....
there's this girl .
i love her , man .
i love her , but she is driving me crazy !
i can't sleep .
i can't work .
i quit the show .
i totally phoned in that dennis quaid movie .
i mean , it's like ....
hello?
god , it's almost like this kabbalah crap doesn't even work !
rusty , call for you .
dude , don't ieave .
yeah?
i have a message for robert charles ryan ... ... soon to be ex owner of the standard hotel .
you got him .
last time we spoke , you hung up on me .
you used some nasty words .
i got sensitive ears .
i admit i was a little emotional that evening .
think about that night a iot , don't you?
i thought i'd be dead before i heard the sound that killed me .
i've been asked to show restraint .
otherwise , you would've gone out ... ... to your favorite car of all the 17 you own , and as soon as you turned on the ignition ....
you got two weeks .
now , you told me that your wife said that he called it ocean's 1 1 .
now , who decided that?
i'm a private contractor .
it was a collaboration .
that moniker is insulting .
it was one job we did together .
i don't know where this proprietary stance comes from .
it seems possessive .
one could make the argument that because it was danny's idea hang on a minute .
we all had our own areas of expertise .
i mean , without us , it don't ieave your head , mate .
it just hurts , you know , because ... ... it seemed we all agreed to call it " the benedict job .
that's what we called it when we were doing it .
if you wanted to call it something else
when you have a problem , who do you go to?
rusty .
rusty .
thanks .
let's get back on the topic .
based on what we stole , plus interest ...
... how much does everybody owe? $1 7 . 34 million .
assuming benedict gives us prime plus one , which i doubt .
figure 1 9 to be safe .
okay , 1 9 each .
anybody got that?
what , you think the stock market's some great mystery ... ... beyond the realm of human understanding?
didn't you see the signs?
i saw the signs . how much is everybody short? how much you short?
fourteen .
fourteen .
all but 5 million?
yeah .
you gonna start with me?
you don't know what it's like to create something from scratch .
well , with interest , i'm short 7 .
eight .
i spent about a million , mostly on talent development .
that makes it 7 for me .
boy , the interest just kills you .
i'm llght 9 .
what's the interest?
about 6 .
then i owe 6 . how?
what?
i've been staying at my parents '.
i owe 25 .
hotels , man .
saul?
i haven't spent it all , but i will .
i'm out , fellas .
as ranking old timer , i gotta say , i just can't do it .
at my age , i think i earned the right to be selfish .
i wanna thank you all for the wonderfui opportunity .
you're all aces in my book .
but i want the iast check i write to bounce .
saul , you having a iaugh?
saul .
i can handle saul's share .
you don't have to .
who would i talk to if you were all dead?
that's a good point .
all right , i owe 1 0 .
amazing?
yeah , but it's a nice place .
so that comes to ...?
ninety seven , give or take . he didn't find us on his own .
someone helped him .
another thief .
nobody we know would violate rule number one .
what we do know is we need a job .
we need a high paying job .
we're too hot to work anywhere in this country .
so we go abroad . how about we go?
we're on the 5 : 00 .
good .
where are we going?
amsterdam .
amsterdam it is .
clock's running .
let's go .
never been to amsterdam .
i hear german girls are really hot .
rusty .
amsterdam?
yeah .
don't tell danny .
hey , rusty .
rusty .
sorry , sorry . hey .
what are you doing?
what's wrong with you?
nothing .
what?
can i?
can i?
what?
just for a second , can i talk to you?
what's wrong?
i just i don't know .
this might not be the perfect time or whatever to talk about it .
okay .
i've been thinking .
i've been doing my homework .
and i'd really like ... ... to play a more centrai role this time around .
right .
i feel like i've
right .
i'm ready for that , and i
way overdue .
i was wondering if i could come to the meeting and help you guys negotiate .
okay .
it's just a sit down with matsui .
he's got his own ianguage , this guy .
i watched you and danny really closely iast time around .
i iearned a ton .
linus , in my professionai opinion , you're not ready .
okay .
yeah , i mean  but but but ... ... if you're convinced you are ready ... ... i can speak with danny .
we can make this happen .
but you gotta be sure .
not sure?
no , i am .
you're sure?
but if i had a question , i could
you would call me?
right .
okay .
any time .
okay .

yeah .
who's there?
li it's
what?
it's linus .
is rusty here?
rusty ...?
do you know where rusty is?
no .
so have you met matsui?
seriously , what do you think of me ... ... you know , in terms of just ieadership potential?
the fact that we're unemployable shouldn't enter your mind .
otherwise , you're wasting time .
don't mention benedict unless he does first .
and if he does , tell him everything .
right .
stay on point .
and don't forget the other thing i told you .
what?
about llstening .
relax .
remember , if we don't get this job , we're dead .
rusty , i tried calling you all yesterday .
so finally , she slams her vodka tonic down on the tray and says : " hey , maybe that's why i've been feellng so warm recently .
yeah .
so to business?
to business .
a doctor who speciallzes in skin diseases ... ... will dream he has fallen asleep in front of the television .
later , he will wake up in front of the television ... ... but not remember his dream .
would you agree?
if all the animals along the equator were capable of flattery ... ... then thanksgiving and halloween ... ... would fall on the same date .
yeah . hey .
when i was 4 years old ... ... i watched my mother kill a spider with a tea cozy .
years iater , i reallzed it was not a spider .

i am a traveler in both time and space
to be where i have been
is he all right?
are we all right?
" kashmir "?
is that your idea of making a contribution?
we hadn't even started yet .
we were this close to iosing that .
okay , i don't even understand what happened in there .

a cheap one .
she's 7 .
confined to bed with a case of
no , don't tell him about it .
i'm sorry .
okay .
so , what does this mean?
it means you stay here .
the mark's name is van der woude .
a semi known , wealthy recluse .
he claims to sell antiques , but hasn't actually sold one .
his store is his privately owned home , which no one ever enters .
but don't let van der woude's eccentricity fool you .
the house is extremely well protected .
what are we after?
it's a document .
it's a very old , very valuable document .
yeah , what is it?
a stock certificate .
the first one ever issued from the first corporation on the planet .
dutch east india trading company .
the only one of its kind .
what's the take?
2 . 5 million euro .
wait .
each?
no .
who negotiated this?
that's a iot of money to a iot of people .
are you out of your mind?
if we do one job a week at that rate , we won't pay benedict off until ....
september 2005 .
jesus christ , danny .
i hear you , but it's what's avallable .
after we pull this job off ... ... matsui's gonna throw us another .
it's gonna pay 1 0 times this one .
which will buy an extension from benedict .
you hope .
i hope .
now , the good news is that matsui gave us the system's master code .
so , what are we waiting for?
van der woude .
that's the bad news . he never leaves . he's agoraphobic . he's never been out of his house?
not in 10 years since he moved in .
does he believe in fresh air? he opens his window .
what does that mean?
best time of arrival .
means he opens his window .
every night at 1 : 30 he takes an ambien , puts on beethoven's third .
by the fourth movement , he's out like a llght .
so we go in at 3 a . m .
okay , can we tap into the system from the phone llnes?
it's a closed ioop system with two servers iocked in titanium cases next to his bed .
so hacking in is out .
look at this .
telephone repair truck , basket up to the second floor .
telescoping rod through the window , tap out the freak's code .
dumb idea .
one iane , one way streets .
dumb idea .
all right?
any stoppage will bring cops .
the outside is covered by five survelllance cameras .
monitored 24 hours a day by a security company . he's got five exterior cameras?
this guy is a freak .
super freak .
what about through the roof?
two more cameras , pressure sensors  a iaser net over the trap door
smoke the freak out .
yeah .
smoke the freak out . hey !

do we have to use that term?
what term?
" freak .
the nationai institute of mentai health estimates 5 . 6 percent of adults ...
... develop " agraphoriaphobia .
agoraphobia .
whatever .
i'm just saying , i mean , do we ...?
we don't need to be an organization that iabels people .
oh , now we're an organization?
you'd call emily dickinson a freak?
are you hosting a telethon?
who's emily dickinson?
am i the only one who feels funny about steallng from a ...?
you know , a handicapped guy?
well , i don't care . hell , yeah .

ahab with a piggyback .
livingston?
i can get anything .
it's done .
ahab with what?
boys .
you're making that up .
that's
that whole " ahab with a piggyback , " that's not real?
let me in . how do you think it feels ...
... when someone bangs on the door?
i gotta go to the tollet .
otherwise , i'm gonna shit on your feet .
come on .
show me them specs .
i've been doing this since i'm 12 years old .
you're micromanaging .
you gotta find people you can delegate to .
otherwise , you'll never have a llfe .
i don't want a llfe .
i want the hotel to run like a hotel should .
reuben .
yeah .
great .
okay .
good .
maybe .
fantastic .
remember in miller's crossing where turturro begs for his llfe?
sure .
look into your heart .
i cry every time .
what?
we have no llne of sight .
our only possibility , the window .
we're three inches too high .
there's no clear shot , even with basher .
in the physicai universe we occupy , it cannot be done .
what about the guy from the bulgari job?
nagel .
spoke with him .
anything?
lot of ideas , none of them any good . he's pushing this new holographic technology .
really interesting stuff , though . he can reproduce anything 3 d. how about 97 million?
we're forcing it .
yeah , we're forcing it .
you know what we haven't thought of?
what?
we turn ourselves in .
what could benedict do to us then?
there you go .
call the cops , tell them we did the bellagio job .
they put us away for 20 years .
that'd teach him .
i think tess would stick around .
you look great in jumpsuits . hey ...
... how's the hotel business?
sucks . how's east haven?
sucks .
i don't know .
can't turn my brain off , you know .
it's me .
we go into some place , and all i can do is see the angles .
it's what i do .
it's what i've always done .
i love it .
i don't know .
some sort of weird irony , you know?
tess watching me scratch and itch . hey , llsten .
you know , the world's gone nuts and you're ....
what'd you wanna do?
it's not attached to the adjacent bulldings .
the whole house?
we're just raising it silghtly .
schumann did it in '64 in venice and '73 in istanbul . he only had a crew of six .
we can't tilt a house .
did it with the leaning tower of pizza .
exactly , thank you .
it took 300 men over two years to do it .
there's 30 pylons .
we cut them , insert the jacks and crank away .
it's really our best plan , considering it's our only plan .
crank for how long?
like i said , it's our only plan .
what?
oh , oh , okay , hold on .
try that .
number five .
i'm a go .
master thieves who practice the iong con live separate lives as civilians .
they have iegitimate jobs and families ... ... which make them extremely difficult to catch .
the greatest thief of all time was , without question ... ... gaspar lemarc , who either dled in portugai in 1 988 ... ... or in hong kong in 1 996 , or he's still alive .
we may never know for certain , because lemarc ... ... was never captured or photographed ... ... despite being active for over 50 years .
the thief we know only as the night fox .
so named for the small onyx figurines he ieaves behind to taunt us ... ... the night fox must be considered our number one priority . his string of high profile crimes are an embarrassment to our branch ... ... to our entire profession .
we need more than traditionai resources to pursue thieves like the night fox .
we need to train ourselves to think the way they think , to see what they see .
and we should not allow ourselves to be distracted
i'm sorry .
someone just robbed the van der woude house .
what?
hi , isabel .
well , we could really use your help on this one .
i hope the scene hasn't been contaminated .
when can i speak to mr. van der woude?
probably tomorrow . he's heavily sedated .
we can't figure out how they disabled the alarm .
shorted it out somehow?
no , that would have triggered the system and damaged the circuits .
well , then .
then i don't know how they got in .
they had the code .
someone other than the owner must have known it .
impossible .
van der woude programmed the iast nine steps of the system . he set it and never left the house again . closed ioop .
redundant servers .
titanium encasement .
it's not bad , actually .
yeah .
thanks .
do we know each other?
i think i saw you yesterday .
oh , yeah?
yeah , you were being chased by the pollce .
chasing me?
no .
i don't think so .
i'm quite sure it was you .
doesn't say much for the police .
no , i love rome .
i love it .
but there's an opening at work the ievei above me , and it's
i was thinking i was gonna try out for it .
it's in amsterdam .
my mother has family there , so it'd be it'd be good .
he lifted the whole house?
the whole house .
the entire house?
the entire house .
it's called a schumann special ... ... named after this guy , a brilliant guy , max schumann .
then he did it in istanbul in 1973 .
what is it?
it's where the crossbow bolt hit .
the crossbow bolt?
they fired from that rooftop through this open window .
with a crossbow bolt from that roof through that window?
that's a very difficult shot .
no , it is an impossible shot ... ... until they raised the building .
check the pylons .
they'll be elevated .
you know the name max schumann?
no .
well , they do .
who?
the americans .
wait a minute .
exactly .
why would they bring the drill if they weren't planning to use it?
what?
oh , god .
what?
i don't know .
congratulations .
you are the second person to crack the van der woude safe tonight .
in arriving second , mr. ocean , you havejoined a long line ... ... of people who've worked hard and risked a great deal only to get somewhere second .
you don't know these people by name , of course , because they enter oblivion .
you know this word , " oblivion "?
it means to be totally forgotten by everyone forever .
and it's where you would be now if it weren't for the bellagio heist . how does this guy know who we are?
in a way , i'm responsible for you coming to amsterdam in the first place .
i hired matsui , and matsui hired you .
that's the guy who dimed us to benedict .
all of them , including ocean .
yes .
i find that hard to believe .
and you are?
you can call me the night fox .
the night fox .
okay , mr. night fox .
what will this information cost me?
don't worry .
nothing .
nothing?
who do you think you're deallng with?
nothing costs nothing .
and this information is definitely worth something .
let's just say our interests are temporarily aligned . how so?
well , the information is free , but it comes with certain conditions .
such as?
restraint on your part .
restraint?
that's asking a iot .
what else?
two weeks to buy themselves out of trouble .
two weeks?
i can live with that , even if they can't .
just out of curiosity , what will you make them pay?
for ietting them live?
everything they stole , plus interest .
a iot of interest .
but didn't your insurance cover what was stolen?
of course .
so you're asking them to double your money?
well , do you really think that's fair?
fair?
i certainly hope not .
so , what about the information?
okay .
it's on your desk .
he was here .
around 3 : 30 this morning .
i can tell .
who?
the night fox .
go down to the dampkring and pick up a guy called matsui .
real name , ian nicolas mcnally .
the night fox was here at the same time as the americans?
why?
that's what we're gonna find out .
what is he doing?
get him out of there .
god .
hello , frank .
i can't understand what we did to this guy .
why does he have it out for us like this? how did he get that code?
doesn't matter . he broke rule number one . he's on the llst .
great time for a turf war .
i spoke with frank's associate in dubiln .
she's trying to get us a name on this guy .
our train ieaves tomorrow at 1 : 38 , okay?
where is frank?
i don't know .
it's gonna get out .
then we'll be dead , and no one will wanna work with us . housekeeping .
turndown service for mr. ryan .
hi .

it's nice to see you again , robert .
you too .
of course , you've been seeing plenty of me , haven't you?
i like this one .
i call it " thief ia mode .
schumann special , huh?
i guess that's what i get for opening my mouth .
so , what about the night fox?
did he ieave you a message?
what about the figurine?
you still have it?
i suppose it's a compliment in a way .
i guess he's threatened by you , though i can't imagine why .
you have no idea what you're up against .
the french police think he's better than lemarc .
well , he is french .
let me give you some advice .
find out how you offended him .
apologize .
beg for mercy .
got to go .
any message for frank? he's been hanging around the station .
on what charge?
well , we found a print of a size 14 hi tec magnum boot at the crime scene .
and?
bought with a fraudulent credit card .
from that point on , well , there's only one , maybe two great nail salons in amsterdam .
and you lied to us .
yeah , and to me .
well , frank knew .
frank knew you were in touch?
i wasn't in touch .
i was more like keeping tabs .
she's a cop !
detective , actually .
where'd she learn all that schumann crap?
dad .
what , he was a cop?
thief .
oh , god .
was he good?
oh , yeah .
great .
pissed off ex girlfriend whose thief father ... ... taught her every trick in the book .
well , she just made danny and yen .
in the next 48 hours , your pictures will be in every pollce station .
nobody looks at them .
nobody but cops .
detectives .
you'd think she'd have sympathy for us ...
... if her old man was a thief .
is that sympathy or empathy?
no , her old man got popped a day before her 9th birthday . dled in jall .
so i wouldn't count on much sympathy .
or empathy .
she's gonna have the hotel under survelllance .
great .
we'll just eat room service , watch movies and wait for benedict to kill us .
who's on the $1 00 bill?
adams .
john travolta . he said every problem ... ... is an opportunity in disguise . he couldn't say that with a . 45 in his mouth .
no , you're missing the sliver lining here .
now , she gave us a name , didn't she?
the night fox .
one phone call , we're gonna find out everything there is to know about this guy .
the name is m. diaz .
d i a z.
it's a black duffei bag .
the team's in rotterdam .
the bag's in brussels . he's the modern man : disconnected , frightened ... ... paranoid , but with good reason .
it's too sad to be funny .
unusable .
i think i can get 20 minutes out of it .
great .
i got it .
the team's in barcelona .
the bag's in madrid .
this is a moral issue we're dealing with here .
and we don't have a grease man anymore , because he's in a bag somewhere .
we got a bag man .
such an ape .
an animal with no feelings .
i have feelings .
no , you don't .
i feel bad for the guy . he's in a piece of iuggage , but he's got water .
what did you want them to do?
get off the bus .
and pick up the bag with our friend in it . how many pro soccer teams are fielding 50 year old men?
rusty's not 50 years old .
yeah , dude , we know rusty's not 50 .
you think i'm 50 years old?
let me ask you something .
no , wait , let me ask you something . how old do you think i am?
forty eight .
you think i'm 48 years old?
fifty two?
maybe he should've asked me .
nobody should ever ask you anything .
that guy doesn't have a hard enough llfe right now?
you gotta
you're gonna defend him?
they put yen in a handbag .
can i ask you something?
ever notice?
if you're gonna ask a question ... ... give me time to respond , unless it's rhetorical ... ... in which case the answer is obvious : yes .
okay , can i ask?
yes .
you ever notice that tess looks exactly?
don't ever ask that .
seriously .
not to anyone .
especially not to her .
wait .
why not?
look .
it's not in my nature to be mysterious ... ... but i can't talk about it , and i can't talk about why .
can i ask you?
do i look 50 to you?
yeah .
really?
well , i mean , only from the neck up .
saul?
what's the matter?
nothing .
you wanna go out?
it's nice .
no .
you wanna watch something?
the game's on .
no .
you hungry?
i'll heat something up .
no .
saul , ever since you got back , you've been acting strange .
what did danny want?
nothing .
nothing? how could he want nothing?
all right , the night fox has a name .
franois toulour .
baron franois toulour .
father was a french industrialist , mother was italian nobility .
he never met her , but he inherited her title .
the bad news is he's rich , he's bored and he's talented .
the really bad news is he was trained by lemarc .
this is not good .
with the lemarc?
gaspar lemarc?
that's the one .
well , we're doomed .
we're not doomed .
he's one guy , and he's french .
yeah .
before we get too impressed by his background ...
... let's hear what he's done .
he started in the '90s .
bank of geneva , the danish treasury , the bank of italy , amc amro ... ... the brussels diamond exchange , antwerp diamond exchange .
wait , wait .
all those in the 1990s?
i'm only up to '96 .
seriously?
in '97 , he went through an art phase .
he hit the tate in london , the louvre in paris , twice , and the prado .
wait .
no , no , hang on .
the prado museum in '97?
that was moretti .
everybody knows that  he is moretti .
it's one of his aliases .
okay , i'll skip to my favorite .
in 2002 , he stole the king of morocco's 200 foot yacht .
vanished into thin air .
crew surfaced days later in a life raft .
couldn't remember a thing .
how do you hide a 200 foot yacht?
if the king knows , he's not telling .
he got it back a month later .
he now plays tennis with toulour every weekend .
we're in some serious trouble here .
copy that .
so , what do we do?
we respond .
respond?
how?
in kind .
mr. ocean .
you broke rule number one , and that has consequences .
oh , you must be talking about the paintings .
don't worry .
you'll be dead in five days , and i'll get my paintings back .
unless you have an accident first .
i don't think so , daniel .
perhaps i should explain to you why i'm tormenting you .
i'd like that .
last month i was in portugal to see my mentor .
lemarc .
indeed .
a very loud and annoying american businessman was there the same day .
he worked for a big insurance company .
he's the one who suggested benedict to you as a potential mark .
you know the man?
what about him?
he said it was the most beautifuljob he'd ever seen .
he went on and on about this job , and then he said ... ... it showed you were the greatest thief in the world .
but the worst part is that lemarc never corrected him .
i told lemarc that you can't be better than me .
and he answered that it was impossible to know for sure .
so i thought about that for , like , three weeks in a row , day and night .
and then suddenly , i realized that he was actually right .
it is impossible to compare one theft to the other .
so i guess the only way to know who's the best of us for sure ... ... is to go after the same object .
do the same job .
don't you think that would be fun?
you're being awfully cavalier with a lot of people's lives so you can play out a game .
you're gonna regret it .
come on , mr. ocean . how are you gonna possibly get $97 million by next wednesday?
especially if every safe you crack between now and then is already empty?
whereas if you accept my challenge and win ... ... i promise i'll pay your debt to benedict ... ... and lemarc will hold my money in escrow as a guarantee .
what are we steallng?
the famous faberg coronation egg .
was that your idea or lemarc's?
i think he would agree ... ... that it's the most appropriate thing for us to compete over .
where is it located?
the egg left paris this morning on its way to rome .
it travels with heavy security and usually with one or more replicas .
sometimes they even show the replicas without anybody knowing .
when the egg goes on display monday morning ... ... you'll have 48 hours to steal it before your deadline's up .
when the deadline passes and you don't have the egg ... ... lemarc will know who's the best .
rusty's phone .
who is this?
nicole .
who's this?
nagel .
where's rusty?
he said if you called , to say he was at gunther's .
gunther's?
what's that about?
did he say something?
do you have a message?
yes , i do .
tell him this thing is gonna cost him double what i told him .
and tell him i had to go three times as thin on the iayers .
and tell him if he wants it tomorrow , it should cost him more than double .
and tell him this thing is beautiful .
would fool the bloody romanovs themselves .
and tell him i'm being a nice guy .
and tell him he dresses like a gigolo .
is that it?
yeah .
no .
tell him having a sexy female assistant ... ... is such a terrible clich .
can i get a coffee or something?
thanks .
just a cappuccino or espresso .
well ....
you call me on saturday and ask me to come into my office ... ... and sign a 1077 ... ... and you can't even tell me what they are after?
i can come to your house .
i'm leaving for naples in two hours .
we'll talk about this on wednesday .
it'll be gone by wednesday .
what?
what?
what will be gone?
something worth signing a 1077 for .
ryan and his friends did the bellagio casino heist in 2001 .
i am telling you , this is serious  if that's true ...
... then we should call the american fbl  no , no , no .
maurizio , llsten to me .
agent lahiri ... ... a 1077 is not a small thing .
unless you can tell me what they are after , there is no point in discussing it .
hey
because lemarc stole it in 1 980 when 23 others falled .
because the night fox is trying to prove he's better than ryan and his friends .
this is ridiculous .
you say the egg will be stolen .
then you say lemarc already stole it 24 years ago .
which one is it?
both .
what?
lemarc's wife made him put the egg back .
when i signed a 1077 for you on the bulgari case ... ... you requisitioned 30 of my men for three months and made zero arrests .
i won't do it again .
first , we cannot go at night .
the laser grid in the great hall's impossible to beat .
nothing's impossible .
this is impossible .
it's in constant motion , programmed to improvise randomly ... ... meaning we can't plan our way through .
all right .
so it's a daytime play .
we're still short three on the inside since isabel made you and yen and danny .
we could try a smuggler's paradise .
it hasn't worked since the '50s .
'54 , actually .
what's option two?
baby jane , squeaky wheel , followed by a number two son .
it's complicated , but it's got a high success rate .
the only problem is
we can't do it without a grease man on the inside , without yen .
we'll have to risk it .
we'll put him in disguise .
1 0 : 1 0 , i ieave the caf , proceed west .
1 0 : 1 1?
i enter the second floor bathroom .
1 0 : 1 3?
approach the spanish steps from the south .
basher and i enter by the main entrance .
1 0 : 1 5?
i help yen into the ventilation duct .
1 0 : 1 8?
i move reuben to the egg room .
i pause in the great hall while  i go to the egg room .
1 0 : 21?
yen enters the mainframe room . he cuts power to grid 1 4 a. he radios me .
i signai linus .
i then go to the egg room .
1 0 : 22?
i drop my keys and move reuben to his mark .
i blind camera one .
i blind camera two .
i blind camera three .
camera four .
i make the switch .
right .
1 0 : 24?
i pull to the corner of the main entrance .
i meet danny at the steps .
we head north .
1 0 : 25?
turk and i make the drop .
all right .
really good stuff , guys .
really good work .
all right , we'll pick it up here in an hour .
it's a slam dunk .
great .
1 0 : 45 , we all get arrested .
you bet . how was toulour? he was predictable .
you hear from nagel? he'll be here .
that's a lot to presume from a guy like nagel .
follow it up .
this is isabel .
it's johan .
ijust set a 6 : 00 meeting for you with an andre ciment ... ... who says he had four paintings stolen from his house in lake como .
and when was this?
sometime friday .
he's missing two monets , a turner and a degas .
which degas was it?
blue dancers .
supposedly , there's surveillance video , but i haven't been able to confirm that yet .
it is all about error correction .
three thousand separate , translucent , digitai slivers ... ... instead of the 1 000 i thought it would be .
thank god it doesn't have to move .
re creating the llghting was a pain .
it's a mixture of tungsten and reai llght .
but i think the color rendition is pretty damn accurate .
batteries are in the base .
two minutes maximum .
you're good .
it's good , roman .
you're a genius .
i think i am .
you'd have never got past that grid .
that's why you're paying me double .
what?
no , no , no .
you got my message .
who's that sexy phone voice?
early bond .
what message?
the message i left with sexy phone voice nicole .
on your mobile .
got something going with gunther?
am i in?
okay , when did you ieave the message?
two days ago .
she had your phone .
she has your?
yeah .
that means that she's?
yeah .
well , you better  yeah .
that's great .
i mean ....
so?
so who's got my money?
who has got my bloody money?
jesus .
sorry to hear about your mom .
she was an amazing ....
well , i thought so , at ieast .
she hated you .
i should've picked up on that .
she hated all thieves .
no wonder you fought .
excuse me?
may i have my phone back?
no .
that's a nice pull , by the way .
thanks .
did you get that tingling sensation down your spine when you did it?
or is that none of my business?
you considered a career change? have you?
i tried hotels .
i'm better at this .
went by the caf for some tiramisu .
it wasn't the same .
who's the night fox?
they did something to the eggs .
why accept his challenge?
because he'll iose .
and how can you beat him?
we can't .
you're not making any sense .
okay .
the bulgari job you pulled with frank when we were together ... ... i knew it was you .
why didn't you say something?
why didn't you ... ... robert?
i didn't want it to end .
you assumed it would .
was i wrong?
you shouldn't be here .
i have a meeting .
someone stole a whole bunch of paintings in lake como .
interesting .
any leads?
the next time i see you ... ... i'm arresting you .
and ocean and anybody else i recognize .
fair enough .
ready?
right .
yes , of course i do .
my blue dancers , my degas .
they took it , unfortunately , and i really would like
do you have any enemies?
anybody out there who would feel wronged by you?
no .
i can't see anyone .
but why?
you think you think maybe the thief ... ... is trying to harm me personally now?
well , i assumed he was after the paintings themselves .
i think it's enough .
ready?
good?
i have something you might be interested in .
it's a dvd with all the hidden surveillance cameras i have to my place .
it's plenty .
i haven't checked it out yet .
maybe the thieves have been careless enough to be photographed .
i doubt it , this level of thief , but i'll take a look .
yeah .
you never know .
okay .
well , merci .
thank you , mademoiselle lahiri , for everything .
thank you .
goodbye .
goodbye .
mademoiselle lahiri .
did you get the faxed copy of the 1077?
a dozen twelve uniformed officers .
metal detectors , extra cameras .
so i'll e mail you the photographs .
do you happen to have a pen?
i'll just give you the names .
okay .
livingston dell , male , caucasian , 5'6 " , 1 50 pounds .
virgil malloy , male , caucasian , 5 '1 0 " , 1 60 pounds .
robert ryan , male , caucasian ....
hello?
buon giorno , mr. elsenhower .
this is your 5 a . m . wake up call .
really?
yes , i'm afraid .
have a nice day , sir .
hey .
what are you doing?
what?
sleeping .
why are you dressed?
it's 5 : 30 , day of .
we gotta go .
let's go .
it's 11 : 30 .
the night before .
but ....
oh , he's mean . he's just mean spirited . how many espressos did you have?
five .
yeah , come on .
i don't know if she's just confused ... ... or she's really turned the corner and hates me now .
you think i handled this wrong?
i was too forceful .
i was too american .
she's different .
maybe you're right , maybe she has moved on .
you know , i talked to a doctor about getting that tattoo removed .
but given its iocation , he advised against it .
that guy doing potsie is unbellevable .
i mean , what's this guy's problem? he's stitched us up twice in two weeks , all over his ego .
it's the first decent evening we've had together in i don't know how long .
all right , all right , iet's just stay on point here .
let's go over the list again .
who died and made you danny?
no one .
i'm sorry .
my emotions are all over the place .
i was forceful , trying to show good leadership
for fuck's sake .
let's go .
you're a good leader .
thanks .
all right , well , iet's go over the llst again .
swinging priest?
not enough people .
crazy larry?
not enough people .
soft shoulder?
not enough people .
baker's dozen?
no woman and not enough people . hell in a handbasket?
we can't train a cat that quickly .
and not enough people .
what about tess?
what about her?
well , you know how she kind of looks like
so what?
yeah , what's your point?
so we do a lookie loo .
it's a lookie loo with a bundle of joy .
a lookie ioo with tess ... ... and a bundle of joy?
you've gone right out of your tree , my son . he's mad .
it's crazy .
it's itallan television crazy , and we're still one short .
no , think about it .
she can get near the egg during dayilght with half the system down .
i mean , that's a trifecta .
he might be right .
make the calls .
linus caldwell , you are not following the procedures ... ... danny talked about if terry benedict shows up .
something is wrong .
what is wrong?
danny's fine .
he's with rusty .
during this part of the plan , they can't communicate with us .
promise he isn't hurt .
i promise he isn't hurt .
you're gonna miss the deadilne .
danny would be thrilled if you met him in rome when thejob's finished .
he misses you like crazy .
plus , you studled art , so i know how much you love rome .
there's no downside here .
wow , they're bringing you along fast , aren't they?
yes .
danny would be more thrilled ... ... if you were on the 7 p . m . out of jfk , which means you have to leave right now .
i thought i'd requested a midsize .
danny here? he wanted to be .
did you have a nice flight?
we weren't sure if you were a window or aisle person . how long's danny been in jall?
just a couple of days , really .
which , you know , on the bright side , he's completely safe from benedict . he told me everything was fine . he lied right to me .
what i think he meant by " fine " is we're running low on time and money ... ... and we're deeper in debt than when we started .
i assume that you have a plan to get him out .
actually , she sounds like her .
no , she needs a southern accent .
can you do a southern?
what the hell is going on with you guys?
not quite .
the accent is crucial .
it's the first thing people notice .
this ridiculous car , what is it doing?
okay , i'm sorry .
all right , i'm just gonna level with you .
due to certain personnei losses ... ... that we have sustained ... ... we're various readjustments had to be made .
you're gonna have to play a small role in this thing .
okay?
so can you put these on?
i'd like you to put this hat on .
you're gonna put on that , and you're gonna stuff it with that .
and we'll turn around , just give you a little moment .
small role .
who am i supposed to be?
well ....
oh , really?
well , absolutely .
i can have we can make the suite available .
no , no , no trouble at all .
i mean , we would love we are honored that she would think of us again .
okay .
okay .
thank you .
bye .
how is this going to get danny out?
we needed someone famous .
why didn't you get someone famous?
just think four weddings and a funeral .
she wasn't in four weddings and a funeral .
i. " " i wasn't in four weddings and a funeral .
just protect your fake baby .
i'm hyperventilating .
welcome back , signora roberts .
thank you .
she's very tired .
take it .
take it .
okay .
oh , let's hide .
let's hide .
julia?
my name is teresa .
i thought i saw a friend of mine , someone that i know .
no , absolutely not .
you can't turn off the pressure sensors .
no .
well , she can't touch it .
she's a movie star .
she's not the pope , for chrissake .
you're from smyrna , georgia .
you were born in 1967 .
you like croquet and knitting .
your middle name is fiona .
you've got 10 dogs , seven horses .
your favorite color is peach .
she doesn't have more horses than dogs .
i can't do this .
i can't .
tess , we're out of time .
" julia , " please .
julia .
no , we understand you're feeling insecure .
that is totally natural .
you're playing an actress .
they're insecure .
no , i'm not insecure .
i'm freaking out .
yes .
that's right .
brilliant !
you're playing a role .
no , you're playing a role .
i'm apparently playing a real person .
yeah , so?
it's just wrong .
you mean , like , morally?
no .
well , yes .
probably it's not the point .
the point is you want me to speak ... ... for someone who's out there somewhere .
it's too personal .
more personal than your husband doing 25 to life? he won't do 25 to life .
benedict will have him killed immediately .
don't .
i'm sorry , that was stupid .
we're gonna be in and out in 1 0 minutes .
we have to .
that's our time frame .
you don't even have to talk .
give them a big smile , wave at the cameras .
that's all she ever does .
but if you do say something ... ... don't forget your accent .
drop your g's , and longer vowels .
room service .
it's gonna be fine .
you've gotta remember something .
you are an image to these people .
you're like an object .
nobody actually knows you .
the last thing this is gonna be is personal .
aren't you overdue?
why are you in rome?
i'm here on vacation .

being tracked by a pro .
you want her to win .

does she really need to be rushing this quickly?
she's practically jogging .
in thalland ... ... mothers routinely give birth in rice paddies and then go right back to work .
amazing women over there .
rice paddy?
she will not have it in a rice paddy .
she'll be at her own paddy .
and she will be very comfortable because she will be strong ... ... from this walk and this exercise .
was she worth it?
was tess?
the moment that she doesn't talk to you in the restaurant , i knew .
your friends didn't tell you?
no .
that's when you figured it out , huh?
yeah .
but the movie was still enjoyable for me .
okay .
thanks .
if everybody's so freaking smart , how come the movie did $675 million worldwide ... ... theatrical?
julla .
doctor .
doctor , you might wanna call the rice paddy now .
seai off the museum .
nobody in or out .
bring bring it , bring it .
quickly , quickly .
sit her down .
sit her down .
everybody just relax .
can you hear me? talk to me .
she is fine .
she is fine .
she's good?
okay , that's it .
we're done here .
no more pictures .
thank you , bruce willis .
just don't worry .
thank you , museum .
we are code four .
walk slowly , like you're doing .
we'll get you into the car as fast as we can .
okay , we're not stopping .
don't stop . hello .
we're on our way out .
isabei lahiri , i'm with the museum .
it is so great to meet you .
we're very iate .
i'm sorry , this won't take iong .
i don't wanna be an annoying fan , but my boyfriend is such a huge fan .
i can't iet you ieave unless you sign something for him .
do you mind?
that's very unorthodox .
sorry , it won't take iong .
what's his name? his name's robert .
aren't you a lefty?
i thought you were a lefty .
she is a lefty .
often pregnant women become ambidextrous .
you are a big fan .
she doesn't necessarily have to sign lefty .
oh , thanks so much .
this is great .
okay .
we're on the move .
thank you .
you take care , now .
and one more thing .
i just got off the phone ... ... with someone called marcy who put you on a plane from taos , new mexico to l. a ... ... where you have a 1 : 00 meeting about a film , clowns can't sleep .
anyway , she just wanted me to iet you know everyone's running a llttle iate ... ... and was wondering if you could make it at 1 : 30 instead .
i knew it .
shame on you .
i don't think we've met .
bruce .
isabei lahiri .
nice to meet you .
do you really have a boyfriend?
or were you just?
was that just part of the whole thing with them?
so how'd it go?
you lahiri?
i'm section chief molly starr .
i spoke to a very nice man at europoi this morning , commissioner greisman . he wants you on the next filght to amsterdam .
there seems to be some irregularity with your paperwork .
that one .
let's start with that one .
imagine yourself in a room ... ... that's too short for you to stand up in and not wide enough for you to lle down in .
a room with no llght , no heat ... ... and stone walls scratched by the teeth and nalls of desperate men ... ... men driven crazy by isolation .
you will have rats for company ... ... and a small window that looks out on the world that has passed you by .
your parents will grow old and die , just like your dreams .
your friends will forget your name , tell your stories as their own ... ... because what good is a story when the person who owns it has vanished?
what do you want?
testify against the others ... ... in the benedict case .
the itallan charges will be dropped .
you and the others will be extradited to the u. s. this afternoon .
plead , and you walk with parole .
i can't .
think about it , linus .
for a moment there , i was already forgetting your name .
wait .
just hang on a sec .
linus .
right .
thanks .
you okay?
well , i blew the meet with matsui .
matsui?
let me guess . he pulled a lost in translation on you .
that's his idea of fun for first timers .
i mean how do i not see these things?
don't get down on yourself .
obvious .
we talked about this .
i hope danny and rusty appreciate the job you did in a tight jam .
i am proud of you .
thanks .
we both are .
you?
you told dad?
i had to , sweetheart .
you told dad?
we were on vacation .
i'm sorry .
great .
thanks .
you're gonna be dining out on this one for months . " hey , remember the time your mom had to come to rome ....
i'm sorry .
every time with him .
it's like ....
it's like a ....
it's like a ....
that was for keeping me in the dark .
and that that ... ... is for making me a master thief .
and that ...
okay . ... is for ruining our second third anniversary .
okay .
okay?
come here .
i'm sorry i kept you in the dark .
i'm sorry that i made you a thief .
master .
master thief .
and i'm very sorry that i ruined our second third anniversary .
okay?
okay .
you forgive me?
a llttle .
all right .
what was bruce willis like?
was he?
follow it .
that's ryan's car .
follow that one .
hey , wait , wait !
what the hell is going on?
your father's alive , izzy .
your mom lled to you ...
... to keep you from him . he's alive .
what are you talking about?
when they divorced , she told him if he contacted you , she'd go to the cops ... ... with everything to put him in jall . how do you know that?
and why should i believe you?
i don't believe you , okay?
you know where he is?
i know somebody who does .
there's nothing back there but a forged 1 077 .
no .
really?
no .
no .
that'd be horrible .
it's hard , you know , for dinners .
well , you must have very good contacts .
i hear it usually takes days to buy your way out .
tess , this is franois toulour .
madame ocean , at iast . hello . he's french .
shouldn't you be somewhere else by now , like ... ... outer mongolla , maybe?
well , before we get to that , we just wanted to ask you one question .
what is that? how'd you do it?
oh , so that's why you came .
you wanna know .
well , i guess that's normal .
but i got another deal for you .
you both recognize that i'm the best , and i'll tell you my secret .
yeah .
that ....
make it if you get him to tell us ...
... and tell him that he is the best .
oh , okay .
i won't tell him because you're the best .
all right .
thank you .
all right .
we'll tell you you're the best after you tell us how you did it .
how can i refuse a dying man's iast request?
the egg arrived in rome at 6 : 45 p . m . the saturday before it went on display .
it was at the museum by 8 p . m .
wait a minute , hold on .
you stole it that evening?
with the museum locked down?
how'd you get in the building?
how'd you get past the sensors?
why didn't my recon team see you?
don't touch my thing .
i didn't touch your thing .
like it works .
you got greasy hands , you put them on the iens .
now i can't see .
you can't see anything .
i see you .
you look like a retard .
you look like a retard .
i'll pay you a million dollars if you don't speak for a month .
one month .
i wanna eat your whole head .
go ahead .
a million dollars .
no joke .
right .
with no equipment , no rope .
of course .
come on , don't tell me you don't know how to do that . how did you get by the iaser field in the great hall?
the iaser fields .
well ....
okay .
toulour , you're the best .
well , thank you , danny .
good .
now , if you can just get us our money ... ... we'll be going .
the money?
what money?
the money that you agreed to pay benedict if we won .
we're under a deadilne .
no , no , no , you don't understand .
you didn't win .
you iost .
and not only did you iose ... ... your entire crew got pinched .
i gotta tell you something .
you don't look anything like her .
eventually , the nose , but the ears
i mean , the way you walk and you dress ....
that means that you spoke to lemarc .
you spoke to lemarc?
since i'm dead , i think my involvement in this should stay among the three of us .
of course .
absolutely .
it's ironic that the solution to all of our problems will be provided by toulour .
i'm sure i provoked him by agreeing with my american friend that you might be better .
i apologize sincerely for the trouble i've caused you .
there's no need .
especially now .
remember , from the time you see toulour at his villa and the challenge begins ... ... you must assume he will have you under survelllance everywhere you go .
you'll have to put on a very elaborate show .
the egg , the reai egg ... ... will be carried in a backpack on a train ieaving gare du nord ...
... at 9 : 30 a . m .
thank you .
you saved our lives , gaspar .
yeah .
and i'm still getting the better of you .
and i stole a repilca?
your paintings are in a high security warehouse in milan .
it's 1 7 via andreotti , unit 222 .
security code is 2 3 1 1 6  6 4 6 .
thank you .
listen , all games aside , that was that was very good .
that was good . how'd you do that?
well , i told you one story tonight .
i think that'll be enough .
so now ... ... if you , both of you , could please ....
now .
whose house is this?
it belongs to a thief i know in paris . he knows my father?
probably better than anyone .
who is he? he helped with the whole night fox thing .
what's his name? his reai name?
i don't know , actually .
i've only known him as lemarc .
lemarc?
oh , my god .
where the hell have you been?
waiting .
for what?
for this .
oh , my god .
so we done?
issue closed?
is it actually good?
it's good .
trust me .
i don't trust you , and i don't trust ocean .
if it's good , we're done .
these grudges , they're awful .
nobody wins .
danny's had enough of this meshugaas .
and the competition , it's worse than our business .
always some new young punk trying to prove himself .
guys like ocean , they keep coming back .
they don't like to iose .
too much ego , too much pride .
maybe for some guys , but not danny .
trust me on that .
danny don't feel like he iost in all this .
it's hard to believe , but that's how he feels .
well , if he tries anything if anybody tries anything , i'll be waiting .
terry , i can't predict the future .
i pay professionals to do that , and even they get it wrong sometimes .
i can't say that nobody'll ever try to rob from you again .
if , god forbid , anything does happen to you ... ... we will not be involved .
you better not be , reuben .
you better not be .
hey .
good to see you guys .
you don't remember?
you put me through hell , and you don't remember?
hey . hey .
you're more beautifui than ever . hey !
five oh five?
four oh five .
who's winning?
i'm llttle .
and you're big .
you're big?
oh , my god . hello .
oh , my god .
you're all under arrest .
you're thieves .
you're crooks .
isabel , livingston dell .
thank you .
isabel , tess .
the adult table .
that's the kids 'table .
let me clear that for you .
i'm in .
can i get another beer?
i feel i know you .
wait , wait .
