# i feel i'm bein 'followed
# my head is empty
# every word i say turns out a sentence
# statements to a stranger
# just asking for directions
# goin 'from being helped
# to being questioned ...
0i , steph?
are you all right?
# i see a man without a problem #
it seems strange to see this procession of miserable specimens .
so different from the strutting hooligans of yesterday , who came here to pollute the air of this town .
yes .
these long haired , mentally unstable , petty little hoodlums .
these sordid caesars , who can only find courage , like rats , by hunting in packs , came to brighton with the avowed intent of intefrering with the life and property of its inhabitants .
and so far as the law gives us power , this court will not faii to use the prescribed penalties .
it may , perhaps , discourage you , and others of your kidney , who're infected with this vicious virus , that you be ordered to pay a fine of 75 .
i'll pay now if you don't mind .
haven't got a pen , have you , your honour?
that's enough , silence !
take him away !
james michael cooper .
you stay right where you are !
i don't have to ask where you've been , do i?
i suppose you think this is clever?
proud of yourself?
no .
no?
you was there , weren't you?
yeah , we were there .
and you had more of this filth with you , didn't you?
you can look shame faced , my lad .
i've a good mind to get the law .
where'd you get these?
dunno .
someone gave 'em to me .
0h , did he?
and you had to take 'em?
no .
you've gotta look big .
if they was rat poison you'd have taken them anyway?
then gone off like savages ruining everybody's peace !
i look at you and don't know what i've brought up !
your sister's not like this !
ain't she?
what do you fucking know , eh?
drugs and filthy pictures !
running riot over everywhere !
you're a little animal , you wanna be locked up !
look what i've got !
a bloody mad thing !
all right .
you're a little savage !
get out of my house , go on !
get out !
you're no son of mine !
wait till your father comes home !
i'll wait !
go on , get out !
yeah , fuck off !
... fuckin 'house anyway , eh?
# get out and don't come back no more
# get out and don't come back no more
# get out , don't come back
# get out , don't come back
# get out
# and don't come back
# no more #
come .
the post room boy .
be with you in a minute , cooper .
absent for a full day last week , cooper .
now , i understand one day's bank holiday's not enough for you , so you have to take two .
may i enquire if there's any reason for this?
not really .
not ill or anything , were you?
no .
mr cale tells me you spent the weekend in brighton .
i imagine you were involved in the ... disturbances there?
yeah , i was there .
you weren't arrested or detained or anything , were you?
no .
i must say , i find your attitude fairly incomprehensible .
i feel i must warn you , cooper , that we cannot tolerate this kind of absenteeism amongst our junior staff .
you've got a good steady job , cooper .
plenty of young men'd give their eye teeth to be in your shoes .
yeah?
find one , then .
i beg your pardon?
you heard .
find one , then .
i'll tell you what to do with your job .
you can take that mail , and that franking machine , and all that other rubbish i have to go about with , and you can stuff 'em right up your arse !
hey , jimmy .
you lose a shilling and find sixpence , eh?
well , look who it isn't .
jimmy , i thought they'd locked you up .
yeah , i got fined , didn't i? 50 .
jesus .
another good customer bites the dust .
we couldn't wait for you , had to get back to our jobs .
yeah , well i ain't bothered .
i was with ace and that .
yeah , we went to court together
yeah .
yeah .
christ , he's really weird tonight .
i couldn't give a shit .
ferdy?
jim?
you got any blues?
yeah , how many you want?
dunno .
how many you got?
a ton .
french blues .
i'll have the lot .
what?
you can't afford it !
where'd you get all that , then?
golden hand shake , innit?
two weeks money .
told him to stuff the job right up his arse .
you sure you want the whole bag?
yeah .
why not , eh?
why not?
all right .
a fiver .
fiver .
what you gonna do with that lot?
start a one man riot?
yeah .
i might .
why'd you chuck your job?
'cos i felt like it .
well , you're bleedin 'nutty .
you was on a cushy number .
look , don't give it all that , right?
i just got fed up .
fancied something outdoors .
so do i.
she's not bad , is she?
i found her by the road in brighton .
see you found yourself a new little boy , then?
hey , jimmy?
hope you find a new job .
0h , yeah?
i could get you a job on the rubbish carts?
you're good at going up and down in alleys .
if i see you round 'ere again i'll fuckin 'kill you !
get off me !
what's the matter?
you're not a face !
piss off !
you piss off !
forget her , jimmy !
shut up and piss off .
you're all wankers and cunts .
wankers !
jimmy !
pack that in and clear off !
what d'you want , you old spunker , eh?
eh?
what d'you want?
what d'you want?
i'll have you , you little bastard !
are you mad?
what's the matter with you?
you're worse than he is !
come on in !
you'll wake the whole street .
it's a bit late for that !
if he comes here again i'll kill him !
can't you come in and talk about it?
do they all have to know our business?
hello , steph .
what you doin 'here?
i wanted to see you .
you've seen me , 0k?
wait a minute , will ya?
what you gonna do?
beat me up?
what d'you want?
come on , i'm late .
well ...
i left home last night .
i kipped out , didn't i?
in some nuthouse?
look , i ain't mad !
what is wrong with you , then?
well , i dunno .
it's just ... it seems like everything's going backwards .
steph?
you sure it's not you going backwards?
no , it's just ...
i can't think straight , that's all .
i mean , nothing seems right , apart from brighton .
brighton was 0k , going to court with the ace and that .
i was a mod there , you know?
i mean , that's something , innit , eh?
what are you talkin 'about?
brighton was a laugh , that's why we went down there .
0h , yeah .
and me and you , then?
was that just a giggle?
0h , what do you think?
all right , so i fancied you .
we had it off .
but that don't mean nothin '.
it did to fuckin 'me .
i can't help that , can i?
if i'd known you'd go mad , i wouldn't have .
i told you , i ain't fuckin 'mad , right?
no , not much .
look at you?
0ne minute you're all right , next minute you're going stupid .
you can't have a bit without kicking your mates 'head in .
just leave me alone , jimmy !
