how did you find me?
i'm smart .

go , go , go !
oh , my god !

why not?
they got shot .

i don't want to know .
just relax .
they're just my little furry friends .
say , " hi , nelson .
somebody was gonna do nasty little experiments on your brains .
but i wouldn't have it .
what do you do , by the way?
i'm in advertising .
advertising .
so you enjoy it?
people tend to enjoy what they're really good at .
besides your job , what else makes you miserable?
i mean , what do you do for fun?
i didn't think so .
no hobbies?
no diversions?
no kinky obsessions?
for one quick second there , i thought you
just get in the car .
want to come up for cocoa?
as titillating as the evening's been , i'm afraid not .

8 : 00 is good for you , right?
you , me , manny , the doorman , that whole thing?
come in .
there you guys go .
i can help you .
see , i have a gift .
a special ability to help men with problems .
i don't have problems .
now , see that , usually , is the first sign .
of what?
denial .
denial?
first of all , i think you work too much .
really?
and what do you know about work?
plenty .
you admitted you do nothing else and it doesn't make you happy .
i admitted nothing .
i was silent .
no special interests , no pets .
you hate dogs .
busted .
actually i do have a pet , a fish .
a fish?
doesn't count .
cold blooded .
sorry .
no , you are a walking case study .
look at you .
you're a workaholic at such an advanced stage ... ... that your intimacy skills have withered away to almost nothing .
left untreated ... ... you could become emotionally extinct .
out of sheer perverse curiosity ... ... how does a lunatic like you help a guy like me?
you live in a box .
i could lift the lid ... ... let some light in .
wow , that's deep .
i feel almost cured just hearing it .
well ... ... if you want my help ... ... it'll require a commitment on your part .
you have to live with me here for a month .
no more , no less ... ... and no work allowed .
you don't even know me ... ... and you're inviting me to move in?
and how's my girlfriend supposed to feel about that?
girlfriend?
you don't have a girlfriend .
i mean , it's something you feel .
there's something intimate a woman leaves on a man that you don't have .
her name's angelica .
well , i feel sorry for angelica .
great .
i'll relay that to her when i leave .
which is ... right about now .
october's almost over .
we can start midnight ... ... first of november .
if you're brave enough to commit , i'll devote myself entirely to you .
brave enough , but not stupid enough .
now listen up , moonbeam .
here's how it works .
no more harassment .
no more rides .
no more extortion .
next time you come into my building ... ... l really will call the cops .

what's in a hot dog?
don't tell me .
i don't want to know .
they're dangerous .
what are we selling here?
we're selling temptation , desire ... ... animal instincts ... ... gluttony , sin .
we want to show man as he really is .
a savage .
he needs fire .
he needs food .
he hunts and gathers .
what does he get?
he gets a hot dog .
we're pagans .
we love our rituals .
our team hits a home run , we're screaming .
what do we want?
we want a hot dog .
let's go to your preteen demographic .
kids , the little angels .
they're not .
they're monsters .
we give them a tuna sandwich , they don't want a tuna sandwich .

this is cheap , tasteless crap .
really?
that's funny , because so is your product .
stop it .

it's mystery meat .
come on , nelson !
it's toxic waste in a tube !
you're killing me !
you're killing us !
you're killing all of us !
mr. leach !
hey , buddy !
what the hell happened in there?
i know .
can you believe that asshole?
baker bohanon .
i've always said you're brilliant .
a machine .
but i knew one day you'd snap , and we'd all burn .
what are you talking about , burn?
you know what was at stake?
how many millions you lost?
you just dragged my agency's name through the gutter .
hold on a second .
gutter?
i'm the best thing this agency's got .
and that rabid dog routine makes you the best?
i don't think so .
it makes you a wreck !
it makes you a liability .
you need a vacation .
now .
screw vacation .
give me another account .
come on .
nelson , did you hear me?
take a vacation .
short or permanent , your choice .

i think chaz can take care of himself .
he just needs a good night's sleep .
hi , sweetheart , how are you?
hey , guys .
nelson ....
sorry .
it's okay .
i was trying to introduce you .
that's ai and osiris .
they own that bookstore .
they used to be friends with jack kerouac .
i don't care .
i don't read .
sara , can you spare 1 5 bucks?
bruce , i gave you those clothes .
why are you so greedy?

nelson , this is abner .
abner , nelson .
abner's gonna set a world record one day .
what's today's project?
standing on one leg .
want to time me?
i have to break the record of 300 hours .
no .
loser .
get a life .
good one .
you let a 10 year old wind you up?
forget him .
what about you?
you sleep with half the city , get the whole neighborhood involved .
you'd prefer if i was a virgin?
considering the alternative , yes .
i'm yours .
all yours .
look , sara , you're great .
you're a very sexy , smart , interesting , somewhat unusual woman .
but we i always think it's best to clarify issues .
you are the most egotistical man i've ever met .
i am talking about a month .
the truth is , i don't have a month .
time is money .
okay .
let's just how long do you think ... ... you could put this big , lucrative career of yours on hold?
just , just
god , what am i talking about? !
you are unemployed !
you don't have a job !
you got fired , nelson .
you have nothing to go back to .
this project of yours feels like an excuse to get laid .
sara , i'm sorry .
i ....
sara , i didn't mean to i didn't think you'd
i don't understand why you're doing this , is all .
i told you .
i have my reasons .
still friends?
only if you give me what i want .
what?
time .
all i can do is a day .
i'll take it .
okay .
i'll take it .
always a thrill to explore new career possibilities .
how much do you charge?
i don't do this for the money .
why do you do it?
i like it .
you can take them off the leashes .
come on .
oh , yes , you're so excited , i know .
yeah , you go raise some hell .
don't tell your mom , okay?
you can let them go , you know , nelson .
come on !
yippee .
come on .
let's go .
come on !
get off me !
so when was the last time you spent a whole day outside?
when my parents dragged me to alcatraz for the day at the age of 9 .
wow .
now you tell me something .
anything .
what was so enlightening about what we did today?
why is letting some dogs go wild a better way to live than my way?
granted , it was mildly amusing , but my third eye didn't open .
well , these things take time .
and you don't have time .
no , seriously .
it's a question of values .
why is doing something fundamentally trivial better ... ... than living a responsible life?
boring as that might seem to you .
and who made you the expert , the doctor , the guru?
why do you have all the answers?
well , i used to own this company called sublime pets .
no , i really did .
and then i quit .
it wasn't fun anymore , you know .
before or after you toured as a standup comedian?
i never did that .
well , this ....
this would be really good for you .
sharpen your instincts .
no , no .
not those kind of instincts .
so the object of the game get your hands off me .
i run around .
you lose track of me .
then you
no , no peeking .
hands off .
count to 10 ... ... then come find me .
one , two , three i'm gonna get you .
four , five , six i know where you are .
seven , eight , nine , ten .
oh , nelson , that was terrible .
you didn't even get close .
this is funny?
i'm sorry .
are you okay?
sara , you're not going to be upset when i leave tonight?
i told you one day .
yeah , of course .
mitch was my october .
he was so shy .
i think he was the shyest man i've ever met .
so ... ... we focused on strengthening his confidence .
and was the patient cured?
oh , yeah .
my treatment was so effective ... ... that we had to terminate the month early .
and what about september?
no .
no september .
what?
you didn't think i was weird about it , did you?
and you and all these guys ...?
does it matter that much to you?
why a month?
it's long enough to be meaningful and short enough to stay out of trouble .
it was delicious .
thanks .
it's getting late .
don't worry about this .
i'll clean it up .
what are you gonna do when you go home?
i don't know .
i don't usually map out my evenings .
you're gonna go home .
turn on your tv .
get bored .
turn on your computer .
go through your work .
get bored .
surf the net .
get bored .
and think of me .
ernie .
try to be wrong once in a while .
it'll do my ego good .
i don't see why we didn't take a cab .
because i make the rules , nelson .
rules you must submit to , utterly and completely .
if you want to be a dominatrix that bad ... ... why don't we buy you the leather and get it over with?
i think i'm strangely aroused .
that's abner .
hi .
is that you?
he's got a face .
it's a good one too .
did you wait long?
no .
good .
what is that?
you didn't .
you did not bring that !
what can i say?
yeah?
just call me genius , i don't mind .
what up , vince?
" what up "?
you , me , edgar price , november 1 7th , friday .
that's what up .
i'm your rainmaker .
you're a genius .
it's about time you said so .
i heard about angelica .
i'm sorry .
as much as i knew , she wasn't right for you .
so do i smell new female friend?
what makes you say that?
you don't return my calls .
there's estrogen in the air .
don't insult me .
come on , who is she?
you wouldn't know her .
but would i despise her?
that's the question .
on a scale of 9 to 10 , is she a 9 or a 10?
listen , i gotta run .
great news on the edgar price thing .
go launch it , okay?
oh , that's really cool .
not .
what is it , pokmon's dinghy?
all right , let's do this .
all boats in the water .
except for this kid's .
that's not a kid , that's a girl .
maybe i should forget about it .
just ignore them , abner .
abner?
abner?
hang in there , ab .
all boats in the water .
let's do this .
say your prayers , abner !
go , abner !
go , abner !

excuse me .
you want to make a hundred bucks?
sure .
come on , abner !
come on !
hey , my boat's all

straight .
straight !
come on , you can do it !
i guess i'm winning .
that little creep is cheating .
no , i'm not .
my boat's just better .
go , abner !
i guess i won .
that was fun .
next time can we do it with cars?
sure .
no .
bye .
see you , abner .
good night .
good night .
you know , that was really nice what you did today .
thanks .
but it's not gonna help him .
what do you mean?
he's gonna have a lot of obstacles ... ... and he has to learn to deal with them .
those kids were laughing at him .
you ever been laughed at?
okay , cheating's bad , i guess .
you're a father figure now .
get out of here .
the kid just met me .
when you don't know your dad , you're not picky .
look at that , nelson .
that's life .
it's just happening around us all the time .
i think that's so beautiful .
tell me your secret dream .
i'm not much on that kind of thing .
oh , come on .
everybody's got one .
one they only tell after a couple of drinks .
tell me .
my father sold door to door .
vacuum cleaners , life insurance .
for a while he even sold plastic food .
we were kind of the joke of the neighborhood .
and believe me , the neighborhood was a pretty grim joke itself .
where'd you grow up?
right here .
i still own the house , but i never go there .
bobby darin , perry como , tony bennett .
for a year or so ...
... l desperately wanted to be a singer .
you thought it would make him happy?
no .
i thought those guys ... ... were everything he wasn't .
successful , proud ... ... in control .
i'd like to hear you sing .
that will never happen .
come on .
one day .
one day you'll sing for me , right?
what are we doing?
the movie starts in 10 minutes .
should we skip it?
i'll get you a cappuccino .
i can find a cappuccino .
relax .
i hope that i can eat all of this .
oh , my god !
somebody went domestic on me .
okay .
well , okay .
i get it .
it all makes sense .
mystery woman , unveiled .
what kind of bohemian backwater is this?
do they read poetry here?
sara , vince .
vince , sara .
hey .
very nice to meet you .
i gotta go .
was it something i said?
vince , the movie .
oh , that's my good friend , um ....
what , you can't remember her name?
she doesn't care as long as i remember to pick up the check , right?
that's incredible .
i mean that is , i think , the most astute observation ... ... of female behavior i've ever heard .
she's funny .
you're funny .
that's funny .
this is my very good friend nelson , and his very good friend ....
tell me .
sara .
hi .
lexy .
hi , nice to meet you .
lexy , sara .
sara , lexy .
we should all go out sometime , get drunk and nasty .
quick order : one cappuccino to go .
quick answer : no quick orders .
we love this place .
we'll be back every day .
i gotta go take care of lexy .
remember the 1 7th : you , me and god .
sara , very nice to meet you .
it was an honor .
very entertaining .
god !
wow .
we're going to be late , and it's your fault .
he's actually a good guy , deep down .
somewhere .
yeah .
i just mean the glibness ... ... kind of wears you out after a while .
do you trust him?
like friends do , you know .
do you think he'll be there for you?
when?
like a scary situation or something .
you may have noticed ... ... l don't put myself in scary situations .
hey , you know what?
why don't we go see that house you grew up in?
want to do that?
that's not too scary , is it?
it's just a house .
i tried so hard not to come back here .
sorry .
ouch .
sara?
i know i don't know a lot of things , but i do know how to slow dance .
you're terrible .
here , let me show you .
i looked up your web site the other night .
you sister's pretty .
looks a lot like you .
but it's not my web site anymore .
it's not my anything anymore .
why'd you quit?
it started out small and then it got big .
that's generally considered a good thing in business .
yeah , well , everything got big .
egos , lives , desires .
i didn't like the big me .
i wasn't very happy .
you want to know the most amazing part of it all?
what?
i got out before it got really big .
can you imagine that?
no , i can't imagine you with millions and millions of dollars .
did you change the beans?
it's hazelnut .
you don't like it?
honestly?
tastes like camel piss .
let's stick to the classics .
excuse me , privacy .
heard of it?
very impressive set of pecs you got .
you work out , then?
me , haven't got time .
your pecs on the other hand , darling , are edible .
now don't forget , dinner's at 8 .
it's dressy , because we're gonna eat and we're going dancing .
we'll see if " last of the mohicans " here has rhythm .
doesn't he know how to make his own coffee?
you ready to go?
yeah .
okay , good .
because i told chaz cherry we'd be on time .
we're calling everyone by first and last names now?
i don't want to see chaz cherry .
i want to get naked with sara deever .
you look beautiful .
thank you , nelson moss .
come on .
you won't be bored , i promise .
chaz cherry is a great cook .
we're here .
oh , hallelujah !
and we're hungry .
too late .
i sold your dinner to the homeless .
nelson , look at you .
didn't recognize you with your clothes on .
nelson , you've met chaz .
this is cherry .
oh , watch the nails .
thanks very much .
wow .
very pink flamingos .
oh , my god !
sweetheart , he says i look like divine .
oh , that's awful .
you could lose a few pounds .
stop .
you stop .
bitch .
brandy this is nelson .
nelson , this is brandy .
hi .
oh , he is handsome .
put it back in your pants .
grab a drink , nelson .
you all right?
you seem a little bit uncomfortable .
come here .
let me loosen you up .
just one top .
is it the music , maybe?
no , it's great .
because we got some michael bolton if you prefer .
alabama .
or is it the decor?
no , it's ....
you're in dresses .
this isn't a dress .
this is a sequined sensation .
cheers .
that's not a dress .
god , let's eat .
come on .
starved .
i am hungry .
there , you want those?
thanks very much .
god , they're absolutely beautiful .
brandy , take care of them .
very nice .
a little loving from the oven
couscous for everyone .
wow , did you make that?
excuse me , what did you just say?
making , buying , it's all a very thin line .
oh , my god .
i don't believe it !
you know what's a thin line?
your outfit .
it's a thin line between late cher and early howard keel .
eat up .
where we're going , you go before 10 ... ... you get a good place to dance and boys get in free .
bring your dancing shoes?
can you dance shirtless?
it happens there .
are your nipples pierced?
you have a " mom " tattoo on your ass?
you're not exactly a muscle mary , but i think you'll cut it .
you're smearing it .
i'll see what lover boy's doing .
you can talk about me now .
we will .
a lot .
you want an advil?
how'd you know?
the couscous .
i'll be right back .
thanks .
oh , god , i love this one .
it's brilliant .
i mean , the tartan's for shit .
what's wrong with the tartan?
it's a scottish thing .
i mean , from concept to execution , it's just sublime .
there you go , sweetie .
thank you .
your home base for everything .
from fast searches to shopping .
get whatever you want
just an ad .
now , don't be modest .
i know you won a gold pencil for this .
how do you know that?
well , i've got a day job as well , you know .
what do you do?
i work in the dreaded world of advertising .
oh , really?
oh , really .
what firm?
baker bohanon .
oh , my god , you're chaz watley !
oh , look .
baby's famous .
don't even go there .
you've been that chaz watley ... ... all this time?
did you get the dr. diggity account?
oh , my god .
nelson , just let it go .
cherry doesn't care about things like that .
oh , really?
cherry doesn't care about things like that "?
i bet chaz cares about things like that .
or do you two not talk to each other?
i know nelson cares about things like that .
she should've told me .
this is
this is awkward .
if i'd known who you were , i wouldn't have
what?
you would've worn a dress?
i don't think so .
you would've been especially nice to me?
yeah , something like that .
thanks very much .
he's not here right now .
i said , he's not here right now .
why are you calling here?
how long have you been doing this?
how long have you been calling here?
i asked
i can't i can't talk .
i can't talk right now .
i said , i can't talk to you right now .
is everything okay?
ten guesses who that was .
shit .
so , how long has it been going on?
it's not what you think .
you've talked to her behind my back?
do you really want to talk about this now?
no .
i'm sorry .
guys , i don't think i'm gonna go dancing tonight .
i feel so tired .
come on , sweetheart .
what was that all about?
she gets migraines .
you know ... ... terrible headaches .
no , the phone call .
who was that?
her sister .
it's a long story , and i am not going to tell it .
hey .
i'm sorry about what happened down there .
that's okay , gives me a boost to know that you're not perfect .
feeling better?
yeah , i'm fine .
chaz told me it was your sister on the phone .
why does it upset you so much?
remember talking about getting naked?
naked with sara deever .
i think it's a good time for that .
don't dodge me , talk to me .
come get naked with me .
what happened?
that's not fair .
you expect me to be so honest ... ... so forthcoming .
i do .
because it's your month , nelson .
not mine .
come on , you don't want to hear about stupid family stuff .
don't be mad .
please .
please .
you're not feeling well , are you?
maybe tomorrow we'll get naked .
and tonight ... ... we'll wear pjs .
every woman i know spends $200 on a haircut .
you use a vacuum cleaner .
quit trying to change the subject .
you made a commitment , nelson .
our time isn't over .
it's one meeting .
why is going to some powwow with this slicko guy , vince , such a big deal?
because it's probably the chance of a lifetime , that's why .
if it's a whole lifetime , why not just postpone it for one more week?
wait , how about next month?
you say , " thank you , i'll be there .
he's one of the greats .
where's my phone?
i hate it .
nelson !
nelson !
damn it .
we can take anything and just sell it , make it work .
exactly .
i mean , we've done very well with telecomputer .
actually , i'm sure you're aware of
no , i wasn't .
we just won the ad age award for that spot .
i think that was last year's spot .
so we have a symbiosis , the two of us , as a team
we know a lot of guys who do this for the awards , mr. price .
not to say we don't get the awards  but still ... ... we're not about the acclaim .
handholding , dinners ...
... sending prostitutes to the client .
prostitutes?
who sends prostitutes?
who doesn't?
we're about the work .
if the work is great , it speaks for itself .
that's all i need to know .
but are you married , any kids?
no , we've avoided the family thing for quite some time .
most of our lives .
good .
because if you're worried about quality of life or paternity leave ... ... or any of that other new age crap ... ... as much as i like you , we can stop right here .
i want to be your full time commitment .
i can do that .
we still had two weeks to go .
what's two weeks?
you're kicking him out anyway .
good shot .
thanks .
you know what?
i should've locked him in there .
i should've tied him to the bed .
what , do you mean you didn't?
it wouldn't have stopped him .
you can't force people to do what they don't want to .
that's the whole point of this thing , isn't it?
besides , i know guys like nelson .
you may have bitten off more than you can chew this time .
that's what i like about him .
it's also what scares the hell out of me .
just so you know , we've got a couple of great clients in our hip pockets .
plus , some leads on some new accounts .
so we come to you fully loaded .
you're not selling me a car , holland .
frankly , i'm not impressed with you .
but your reputation precedes you .
and if i have to take him to get you , i will .
so here's my offer .
it's good as long as we're at this table .
oh , my !
i'm so sorry !
excuse me .
that's okay .
stop it .
you know , sweetie ... ... we are what we do in this world , and you're a waitress .
all that requires is that you bring food and drink ... ... to and from the table without making a mess .
that's it .
so when you screw up something as incredibly simple as that ... ... it doesn't say a whole hell of a lot about you , does it?
i'm i'm sorry .
if you gave a penny for her thoughts , you'd get change .
they ought to fire her .
i always say a bad hire strengthens the competition's hand .
a good general feeds off his enemy .
actually , sun tzu said that last line .
in the art of war .
you're right , nelson .
you're very smart .
take a look , buddy .
not interested .
you don't like my offer?
it's not the offer i don't like .
it's you .
nelson , wait nelson !
you know what?
this isn't  i hope you can afford this .
shit .
oh , jesus christ ....
what's wrong with you?
you just shit in god's face .
if he's your god , you're in trouble .
he's not for me .
he's not for you?
he is you .
you're cloned from the same dna .
i'm not .
if i am , shoot me .
where's the gun?
it's my career too !
you just blew it in there .
what is going on , man?
i know what it is .
it's the girl .
the new mystery woman .
what's her name?
don't ignore me .
what's her name?
sara .
don't you see what's happening?
she has got your balls in a jar .
i'm your friend .
i wouldn't lie .
you blew it in there .
i'm sorry i cost you your job
i don't need your pity , nelson .
you blew it !
you're a loser , nelson .
loser !
fine .
i don't need you , nelson .
have you ever heard of phalaenopsis sanderiana?
it reminded me of you .
you got the job , didn't you?
best offer anyone ever made me .
so when do you start?
we had a little problem agreeing on that .
he suggested immediately .
i suggested ...
... never .
never?
never .
come on , let's keep ernie .
nope .
i found a home .
he's gotta go .
but you love this little monster .
soon i'll love another little monster .
cold , heartless woman .
what about vegan turkey stuffed with tofu and cranberries?
ordering sounds better .
we're not ordering thanksgiving dinner .
it's the one time in life it's good to be " trad .
in that case , are you inviting your family?
no .
holiday fights are a little too traditional for my taste .
what do you fight about?
everything .
religion , money , sex .
sara's decisions .
sara's unconventional ways .
sara's lifestyle .
they think i'm a freak .
you are a freak .
anyway , boring subject .
i'm sure they miss you .
i know they do .
you know , there's a good tradition called " making up .
you could try it .
yeah .
someday i'll have to do that .
mind walking him down?
sure .
thanks .
come on , boy .
say goodbye to sara .
bye .
hey , come on , puppy .
thanks .
yeah .
sure .
see you , ernie .
hey .
why can't she keep one for a change?
i guess she helps more this way .
i've been thinking .
oh , yeah?
if you want to adopt me , you can .
i mean , father sunday is on monday .
it would be good timing .
i don't quite know what to say .
i'll tell you what ... ... l can't adopt you ... ... but i'll come with you to father sunday .
promise?
promise .
wait till my mom hears !
sara !
i have an announcement to make .
what's wrong?
are you okay?
yeah , i'm fine .
what do you keep in there?
nothing .
" nothing " doesn't require a lock .
what's wrong?
so ... ... what's the big announcement?
don't do the dodge .
am i okay?
no , i'm not okay .
i miss ernie .
and i've got a migraine .
so ... ... what's your big announcement?
marry me .
what?
will you marry me?
sara , i stood on the street ... ... and i realized ... ... this is it .
life will never be better ... ... or sweeter than this .
i'm happy .
i'm in love .
marry me .
that's incredibly sweet .
but you don't understand .
yes , i do .
it all makes sense .
i want you .
i want this life .
marry me .
marry me , sara .
i can't .
why not?
because of me .
what about you?
for god's sake , sara .
please , just
just tell me what's wrong .
tell me the truth .
i can't .
sara?
jesus .
i'm fine .
no , i'm fine .
i'm fine .
what the hell is going on?
no , nelson .
no , nelson , no !
no .
is this what you wanted to see?
this is it !
is this enough truth for you?
does this make you happy?
goddamn you !
you just couldn't leave it alone !
sara , stop .
you just couldn't leave it god , just leave it alone .
it's non hodgkin's lymphoma .
it's a type of cancer .
you shouldn't have to find out like this .
i'm sorry .
she's gonna be asleep for hours .
you want to go for a walk , have a chat or something?
yeah .
yeah , okay .
you said she stopped her treatments a year ago?
what about the pills?
it just gets her through the day .
she stopped trying to beat it .
she did it all for a year .
nothing worked .
look , i'm no doctor , but when you're unchecked , wouldn't that?
yeah .
it's spread everywhere .
how could she get involved with me and not tell me she was sick?
i mean , what was she thinking?
she was thinking you'd be the same as all the others .
she'd dump you after a month .
you've got to understand something .
she's completely powerless .
with these rules , you know ... ... they give her the illusion and dignity of control .
it's kept her alive .
the rift with her family , that's what it's about?
these rules .
yeah .
her family couldn't handle it .
they wouldn't let go .
they kept trying to run her disease .
so she took off .
and came here?
she told me if she couldn't live a normal life ... ... she was determined to live an abnormal one the best way she could .
i don't get it .
she loves life more than anyone i've ever met .
how can she just give up?
you listening to anything i'm telling you?
she's not giving up .
she's making the most of the time she's got left .
don't mess with that .
i'm sorry .
i didn't want you to see any of this .
i wanted you ... ... to know me loving life , you know?
come here .
will you do something for me?
anything .
will you get me out of here?
take me home .
okay .
jesus .
they're here .
hey , darling .
hey , sweetie .
you're sick?
you look fabulous .
oh , this is just a lie .
you look great .
want a nice , warm bath?
come on , sweetie .
we'll run you a bath .
what's on the menu tonight?
we have lovely appetizers .
nice codeine .
codeine?
what else?
donnatal , that's your favorite .
come on , girl .
let's get you in here .
okay .
nice and easy .
sara , i know doctors i could call .
no doctors .
i'm gonna be fine , nelson .
but you can't be here .
i don't want you here .
you can't see this .
please , go .
okay , okay , he's going .
i can't stand by and do nothing , just watch her ....
die?
that's why she wants you to go .
go on .
hey , abner .
today's not gonna be a great play day .
i know .
it's gonna be father sunday .
did you forget?
oh , god , i'm sorry , ab .
i can't .
but you promised .
i guess i don't have a dad .
i mean , i do , but i don't know who he is .
so i brought nelson .
we do stuff , and it's fun , because he makes me feel smart .
i guess i feel like ... ... if i got into trouble , he'd take care of me .
kind of like a best friend , just bigger .
thank you , abner .
i guess i'll see you tomorrow .
i don't know .
i probably won't be here tomorrow .
how come?
i gotta do some thinking , make a tough decision .
sara thinks you don't respect her choices?
something like that?
i don't know .
you always see that stuff on tv .
i think you're the coolest kid i've ever met .
i'll see you .
see you .
take care .
shit .
you all right?
yeah .
yeah , i'm fine .
good .
i was planning on serving the pumpkin on the floor , so this is ....
this is really good .
oh , god , chaz .
please tell me we're gonna have fun .
thanksgiving's fun , right?
it's fun .
it'll be a riot .
come here .
give us a cuddle .
i need some fun .
you know , he asked me to marry him .
he's not the first .
no , but it was the first time i wanted to say yes .
so why didn't you?
because , chaz , i let the whole thing go too far .
oh , yeah?
too far for who?
both of us .
anyway ....
no need to talk about it .
he's gone .
well , you did kick him out .
he'll be back if you let him .
i don't want him to come back .
right .
you know , it's okay to break your own rules , sara .
you fell in love .
that's great .
it may not follow your master plan , but you can't control everything .
okay , just stop it .
i really don't need this right now , chaz .
jesus !
there's no rule that gives me the right to put him through all of this .
this hell .
i don't ....
it'll just hurt him in the end .
it'll hurt , whatever you do .
we all will .
but ... ... if i've learned anything ... ... it's that you should have those who love you near ... ... as long as you possibly can .
yeah .
toast !
toast .
happy we stole your land and killed your people day .
oh , al .
that's a good one , al .
here's to you .
here you go , babe .
here's to you .
merry christmas !
merry christmas !
merry christmas , sara .
i think it's thanksgiving , isn't it?
not for you .
you shouldn't have to wait .
does anyone else have a sudden desire for chinese food?
right on !
yeah .
it's good to see you , nelson .
do you know how the chinese celebrate christmas and thanksgiving?
ciao , santa .
i thought you'd never get here .
come on , let's go .
for you , my sweet sara ... ... l bring you 1 2 gifts of christmas .
the famous colombo log .
the salami that started it all .
a kaleidoscope of a coiffeur , for the barking mad pet crusader .
a bullwhip for the dizzy dominatrix .
so you can rule your world in style and whip me into shape .
i present ... ... sara , a custom made fragrance capturing ... ... that special something ... ... a woman leaves on a man .
nelson , this is ....
only the beginning .
why is harriet so hairy?
the definitive guide to understanding our transvestite friends .
tiny bubbles , for those leisurely soaks we love so much .
a hundred muni train tokens ... ... for the many , many ... ... great rides of your life .
a collection of music to swoon by .
dance classes .
mildred's academy of dance , guaranteed to get you off my toes ... ... in a week .
you sure?
i'm positive .
for the gentle lady who hates doing dishes .
a dishwasher !
nelson , this is too much .
it's not enough .
live , and in your apartment , back by popular demand ... ... l give you ... ... ernie !
hi , baby !
i missed you .
and if this last gift doesn't prove how much i love you , nothing will .
every month is november , sara .
and i love you every day .
nelson , there's
this is our month , and it never has to end .
i surrender all attempts to control life ... ... yours or mine .
to love you .
to make you happy .
to live firmly and joyously in the moment .
november is all i know .
and all i ever want to know .
what are you doing?
where are you going?
out .
this will give you time to get your stuff together .
so you can go .
our month is over .
sara , i'm not leaving .
sara !
sara , stop !
sara , stop running .
sara !
sara , please .
i'm not leaving you .
i know you love me .
i do .
i've never felt this .
i never thought i'd have the chance , and you gave that to me , nelson .
