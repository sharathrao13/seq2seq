coolidge college was established in 18
who knows this?
it was in your freshman facts .
the first day of spring semester .
a time to say good bye to the parents once again ... and say hello to a few new student bodies .
as for me , well ...
i like to start off each semester with a certain time honored tradition .
a ritual , if you will , that allows me ... to get my head in the right place .
okay , so suk mee's a little old ... but she is just so damn good .
she's great with these quick jobs ... plus there is no substitute for decades of experience .
that looks amazing .
that is perfect .
you're a pro .
a pro .
look at me .
pro .
well , gosh , that was great .
thanks for the quick job there .
i need these in 20 minutes .
super .
we've got a jumper !
hold on , son .
you don't want to do this .
i didn't want to come here either .
they made me come !
they made me !
first year can be kind of scary , can't it , timmy?
my name's not
but you know what i've learned in my seven years here at coolidge ...
timmy?
i've learned that you can't treat every situation as a life and death matter ... because you'll die a lot of times .
write that down .
i don't have a pen .
well , remember that then .
and you know something , timmy?
i think you've got the balls to make it here .
call me nuts ... but i believe in you .
you see , timmy , you can't let this lead you all the time .
sometimes you've gotta heed this .
i think you've got a lot of heart in there , mister , don't you?
don't you?
i mean , look around you .
timmy?
great work , van .
thanks !
remember my credo , timmy .
don't be a fool .
stay in school .
god , i love this place .
hey , van .
hey , van the man .
i called you last night , van .
my name is van wilder , and this is my home ...
coolidge college .
the last , well , seven years have gone by way too fast .
this school's given me so much .
i just can't seem to give enough back .

and ride you all semester .
basically , we're saying we won't blow the job , van .
by the way , can you tell me if there'll be any international travel?

seven years , and no degree .
you should have graduated twice by now .
i've done a lot in seven years .
if you don't have your doctorate , you haven't done enough .
but you have wasted enough of your time and my money .
pack up your panties , son , because we are headin 'home .
i'm staying here with my friends .
fine .
maybe your friends can pay your tuition .
because this morning i placed a stop payment on this semester's check .
i'm sorry , son .
sometimes in life you have to realize a poor investment ... and cut your losses .
write that down .
i need more time .
there's got to be something that we can work out .
what is that intoxicating scent you're wearing , doris?
i have cats .
meow !
maybe you could put me on some sort of extension ... program?
a little pay as you go?
are you trying to seduce me?
who , me?
no !
you know , maybe this isn't such a good idea .
being bad seldom is .
oh , yeah .
that's the shit .
guess what .
i'm feeling a little cold sore coming on .
maybe we shouldn't do this for three to six weeks .
shut up , bitch , and give me some sugar .
fill this out .
it's a standard payment plan extension form .
you mean , we didn't have to

go , baby , go !
mail it in !
mail it in !
mail it in .
van , you must make four monthly payments of $5, 000 each .
i'm sorry , taj .
i'm gonna have to let you go .
i don't have the resources to pay for your services anymore .
a good soldier does not leave his commander ... just because he lies wounded , arms torn off at the sockets ... intestines spilling out onto the mud , picked at by the birds .
i will stay on at no charge .
okay .
exactly how much money do you have?
he has only $34 .
damn , van !
what the hell you gonna do with $34 , man?
congratulations , taj !
your first blow job .
in my country , a woman's mastery of her gastronomical releases ... is the ultimate aphrodisiac .
desiree is the foremost connoisseur of chili con carne ... and a ta at coolidge .
i wish i had teachers like that .
and just like that , topless tutors was born .
x ... equals ... six?
yeah !
we knew you could do it .
desi told me how she and a few of her grad school pals ... could use some extra income .
taj proved to be an excellent company accountant ... as well as our most valued client .
excuse me .
i'm looking for information on a current student here , van wilder .
freshman year .
i'll get the others .
wait .
there are more of these?
actually , there are many more .
it seems mr. wilder didn't quite come out of his shell ... until mid sophomore year .
thanks .
it's like this itchy , rashy burning sensation .
and it hurts when i
dance?
when i pee .
you hooked up with a burner .

okay , look , that old bag is stronger than she looks .
i'm doing a human interest piece on you .
i'm flattered .
i'd love for your piece to be on me .
but sadly i don't do interviews .
never have , never will .
i do lunch .
my editor did say this would be a challenge .
van , second date with emily .
blue .
brings out your eyes .
kid's got killer eyes , not unlike yourself .
has anyone told you that before?
yes , my boyfriend .
is it true that this is your seventh year at coolidge?
carry the two yes , that's correct .
so what's your boyfriend's name?
does he go to school here?
does he appreciate you?
that's none of your business .
you know what?
you're right .
his name's richard .
he's premed .
van , you have a 1 : 30 with the swim team .
on it .
you have an assistant?
yes , i do .
is there anything you can tell me about yourself ... that i haven't already found out from your public records?
i'll be at the quad tomorrow night at 10 : 00 .

it's a date .
it's an interview , not a date .
gwen , first dates are interviews .
you going out tonight?
rob's coming over .
i'm closing in on that diamond , gwen .
the dynamic duo will seal the deal tonight .
good luck , ladies .
somebody got awfully dressed up to quiz me on my anatomy midterm .
i'm so sorry , baby .
i totally forgot .
i have an interview for the paper .
at 10 : 00 at night?
can't you postpone it?
gwen , first exam most crucial .
it's not like you're on a deadline for the boston globe .
it's the only time he had available .
i'll call you as soon as i get back .
bye .
he?
all right .
gwen , all right !
you're just in time .
take your clothes off .
i'm not taking off my clothes .
it is the naked mile run .
everybody else is in their birthday suit .
except that guy .
i have a few questions for you .
in time .
this is gonna be fun .
you know that three letter word that starts with f?
so you're quite the campus man , heading events like the jger olympics .
yes , well , you haven't lived ... until you've shot putted blitzed on jger .
heinie?
this was a really bad idea .
are we gonna reschedule or what?
who's a big boy?
oh , god !
those things could raise the titanic .
you van wilder?
the strip club owner got tired of using his b squad ... so he came back for the starting lineup .
topless tutors was dead .
we are truly up the ganges river without a bamboo oar .
we're still $1, 200 short of your next tuition payment .
taj , i learned a long time ago that worrying is like a rocking chair .
it gives you something to do , but it doesn't get you anywhere .
write that down .
don't even sweat it , taj .
i've got a plan .
let's go get fucked up .
sounds good .
is that all you think about?
i admit i applied for this job ... because i wanted to cut loose and shake my rump ... but i do not believe that this dilemma will be solved by partying .
can i help you , son?
i certainly hope so , mr. wilder .
i come to you in desperation .
i'm panos patakos , president of the lambda omega omega fraternity .
i'm sure you're aware of our ... stigma .
yeah , you guys have had the best gpa the last 50 years .
indeed , but believe it or not ... the best gpa doesn't get you laid .
damn well should .
amen .
this month marks our 75th anniversary .
i am here to ask you to aid us in throwing a party ... a party we can be proud of ... a party people will actually show up to .
gosh , i'd really love to help , but i have a bamboo oar stuck up my gangees .
it's very scary stuff .
i just don't have the time .
how much is your time worth?
panos reminded me that i had one ... very valuable skill i'd yet to tap my undeniable ability to throw one hell of a party .
i was hanging on by a thread , but i was still making tuition .
the strawberry !
eat the strawberry !
it's worth 250 !
don't you think i know that?
you treat me like a child .
i don't like the way you condescend me .
don't do that !
frankly , you're juvenile .
guys .
i know ms. pac man's special .
she's fun .
she's cute .
she swallows .
but we gotta talk , guys .
huddle up .
come on .
team meeting here .
cowboy .
all right .
i look at you guys , and you know what i see?
a collective gpa of 52, 000?
yeah !
no !
i see a bunch of party animals ... crouched in attack position , ready to strike .
am i right?
no one even knows we're here .
au contraire , mon frres .
girls !
i'd like you to meet sherri and terri .
two girls utterly infatuated ... with men who have larger than normal ... medulla oblongatas .
pearson , i got a hot news tip for you .
it's friday night .
get out of here .
i know .
i'm just doing some final revisions to this piece on euthanasia .
oh , i read that .
made me want to kill myself .
i'm kidding .
where's my wilder story?
there is no story , elliot .
the guy's a joke .
he tries to turn every interview into a date .
a good writer gets her story no matter what .
please get me the wilder piece .
he's throwing a big party tonight .
you should be there .
this is really a pimpin 'good time .
yes , it is .
look who's checking out the badalandabad .
her name's naomi .
that's " i moan " backwards .
i put in a good word for you .
hey , tajy .
let's boogie .
these are the most pathetic bunch of pledges .
you picked 'em .
hey , babe .
why aren't you in costume?
i can't stay .
i have to work tonight .
you're gonna miss the biggest party of the year .
well , i gotta go .
i'll call you tomorrow .

this party so rocks , richard .
this party sucks rectum , jeannie .
okay .
where the hell is everyone?
mad props for this pimpin 'good time ... go out to those hung and handsome bad boys ... of lambda omega omega .
thanks for the good time , fellas .
let's get you some skates .
i'm not here to skate .
for some reason , my editor thinks you're a story .
what do you think?
as a story , i think ... you're a little soft .
wow , all this time i thought i was more to you than just some flaccid story .
a dilemma has arose up front .
don't know if we got our point across .
crystal clear , guys .
this is incredible .
100 percent .
don't go anywhere .
seriously .
van is a godsend .
i would have paid him way more than a grand for this party .
i would have cashed in my israel bonds .
how do you put a price on dignity?
how do you put a price on poonani?
yes !
oh , god !
oh , my god .
feel it !
whoa .
trick or treat .
what's going on?
this vaginal discharge won't let us partake in the party .
graphic .
i'm sure we can accommodate a few more , yeah?
no can do .
we're at maximum capacity .
what are you doing here?
you two know each other?
that's my girlfriend , gluteous erecti .
you must be premed dick .
yeah , that's right .
what's it to you?
thanks for the story .
what story?
brilliant , pearson .
i have been inundated with people telling me ... how much they enjoy reading about this guy .
they want more , and so do i.
i want you to do a follow up .
i did your story , elliot .
i'm not doing another one .
even if i tell you it's gonna be on the front page of the graduation issue ... in two months?
and i quote , " van wilder is a party pimp .
sick boy .
can you believe she wrote that?
van wilder's phone .
i do not foresee that to be a problem .
and that guy she's with all kinds of wrong for her .
sick boy , how are you doing?
van , the shingles are all gone .
that ointment really worked .
thanks .
lookin 'good there , buddy .
he'll call you back .
unbelievable .
van wilder's phone .
terrible .
i think so .
yeah .
hang on .
unbelievable .
van's room .
saturday night , yeah .
that's how did you from the paper?
yeah , that's fine !
okay , thanks .
no problem confirming .
bye .
this writing , it's just
i was just wondering if you could ... slam the door in my face .
van , you must listen to me .
because of her article , everybody wants to have a party thrown by van wilder ... the party liaison .
your cash camel has arrived !
we need to talk .
this is why i don't do interviews .
you totally slammed me .
you journalists and your irresponsible reporting .
i recorded quotes that you got money from the lambdas to throw them a party .
recorded?
what are you , bugged?
do i need to frisk you?
why is my story such a big deal to you?
because i didn't want the students to know i threw the party .
they paid me , but that's not the only reason i did it .
lambdas are cool in their own right .
people just needed to realize it .
i'm sorry .
i didn't know you had a benevolent agenda .
there's two sides to every story , gwen .
i have a chance to make front page of the graduation issue ... which is a huge deal to me .
let me get the other side .
there's this function i'm hosting tomorrow night .
if you want ... you could tag along .
i'll be there .
it's a date .
it's an interview .
remember , today's assignment is about shadow .
so don't get too hung up on detail .
all right , everybody?
oh , lord !
so much sinew , i need a bigger pencil .
8 : 30 p . m .
yeah , that's fine .
word spread around campus .
my calendar was filled with parties to plan .
van wilder , party liaison , was born .
at the hillel house , i broke bread .
and then i broke the boredom .
they said i did them a mitzvah .
that's yiddish for " good deed .
write that down .
oh , yeah , she came too .
this is the second party of his she's gone to .
sounds serious .
threatened?
threatened?
please .
i'm president of both my fraternity and the student government .
he's nothing more than a mild rectal itch .
you know what you do about a mild rectal itch , gordo?
what's that , richard?
you scratch it .
then you scratch it some more .
the more you scratch at it , the worse it gets ... until finally you have nothing left but a raw , chafed ... possibly infected anal cavity .
then it's won .
when all you had to do from the start was take a medicated pad ... and smother it .
all right , people , midterm is next week .
here you have your five categories commerce and trade , so forth and so on .
what you doing?
i'm in the middle of class .
you know , that five letter word .
i thought we could spend some time together ... for the story .
i want you to have this .
yeah .
and thank you .
all right , things to remember commerce and trade
everybody just file out in an orderly fashion .
what?
come on .
hop in .
i am not getting in that thing with you .
if you want the story , you'll get in this thing with me .
what happened?
is everyone okay?
wilder .
are we gonna get in trouble for being in here?
it's cool .
equipment manager owes me a favor .
i introduced him to his wife .
life is all about developing relationships , gwen .
i hope you can skate .
so the deal is , i score ... you cooperate and answer all my questions?
i miss  dinner for two , me and you .
clothing optional .
come on !
holy crap .
my brothers play hockey ... for the rangers .
my dad just didn't see me as a sound investment anymore .
but he gave up on me and my mom long before i ever came here .
maybe seven years of tuition ... is a good way to remind him that you're still angry .
so how long have you and premed richard been together?
since my freshman year .
i bet he's a tighty whitey guy .
excuse me?
white , elastic band , constrictive .
you can tell a lot about a person by the kind of drawers they wear .
like you .
granny panties , i bet .
does that allude to me being the plain , boring type?
i just wanted a visual .
i think it takes a lot more than the kind of underwear one wears ... to define them as a person .
like what?
like their actions .
for instance , most people ... want to get out of school so they can make money .
you're trying to make money to stay in school .
why?
i like it here .
what about your future?
you take life way too seriously .
life is serious .
i used to party with this guy who once told me ...
don't take life too seriously .
you'll never get out alive .
he used to write for the school paper .
he kept babbling about the differences between light and dark beer .
very strange , but good advice .
you think about the future too much , you kinda forget about the present ... obviously .
and i am really enjoying the present right now ... sharing a penalty box and a tri latte with gwen pearson ... who believes censorship reflects society's lack of confidence in itself .
you actually read that article?
okay , look , i read the damn article , but don't tell anyone ... because if word gets out that i read , my reputation shot to hell .
she's smart , she's beautiful ... she can skate .
she's not for you , dude .
she's too high strung .
besides , babes that fine they're way into themselves and shit .
after this weekend , we should have sufficient funds ... to cover your next two payments .
i mean , this girl is dynamite .
too bad she's dating strapper john , md .
where did you find that?
in your room a few days ago .
i'm trying to spark this bong , but this damn thing won't light .
that's no bong !
it's for my schlong !
hold on .
you mean i put my mouth on your cock pump?
oh , damn !
i have a date with naomi tomorrow night ... and i just wanted to bring my a game .
taj , come on !
that's what i'm here for , right?
now , follow my foolproof plan ... and i'm gonna help you put the bang in banglapur .
all you need are the three fundamentals scented candles ... massage oil ... and barry white .
write that down .
hey , no cock pump .
no cock pump .
barry white .
i'm gonna go wash my hands now .
oh , gwen !
your labia feels so good around my swollen phallus .
i'm fairly confident i'm going to ejaculate .
i'm releasing my seminal fluids inside of you now !
are you okay?
yeah .
why?
didn't you
it's kinda hard in 15 seconds .
damn it !
you know the kind of pressure i'm under with my exams .
i'm sorry .
look , i'm sorry .
this semester's marks could determine the next ten years of our lives .
do you realize that?
you know ... you shouldn't take life too seriously .
you'll never get out alive .
what the hell is that supposed to mean?
i'm late for my study group .
she was getting awfully chummy with the rectal itch .
son of a bitch .
disappear !
yes , superior leader , sir .
it's time to excise that cancerous lump .
forget him .
let's crap in the chapter room and make the pledges clean it up .
it'll be fun .
i wish i could , gordo .
i got dinner at gwen's parents 'house .
sounds special .
is wilder gonna be there?
hey , guys .
hey , richard .
is there anything i can do for you today?
dear van
here you go , taj .
get your rave on , man .
thanks .
you got it .
see you tonight .
gwen .
the invite to the parents 'house .
this is big .
this is very , very big .
doesn't she have a boyfriend?
details .
i'm off .
taj , you're in charge .
i do not think i'm capable of handling such a responsibility .
listen to me .
do you know why i chose you as my assistant?

i dabble in a bit of everything .
i've tried to experience all that coolidge has to offer .
surely you have a career in mind .
not really .
i'm still looking for that dare to be great situation .
maybe you should start looking for that dare to be employed situation .
the student body finds van so intriguing ... that my editor has asked me to do an expos on him ... for the school newspaper .
isn't that wonderful?
that will be quite the page turner .
it'll be a very well written article .
gwen is an extremely gifted journalist .
are you and richard in the same fraternity?
oh , no .
van isn't exactly delta iota kappa material .
richard , you rascal , you never told me that you were a dlk .
not that you had to .
i'm gonna go get another bottle of champagne .
richard , will you help me open it?
sure .
wow .
if he's here , who's running hell?
what are you doing out there?
proving a point .
your friend doesn't fit in .
he's a virus , and i'm the vaccine .
i can't believe you're doing this .
pop quiz .
true or false .
you and that gdi have been spending an inordinate amount of time together .
true .
now here's a multiple choice question for you .
you're a , an asshole ; b , an asshole who isn't staying at my place tonight ...
or c , all the above?
what's b again?
gwenny , i'm kidding .
i apologize .
gwenny , where are you going?

it's a good day to die , mcdoogle .
oh , yes .
jesus !
criminy !
what happened to you , wilder?
don't think i don't remember .
you got an a in my freshman economics class .
you remember one thing
apathy is the glove into which evil slips its hand .
i'll write that down .
you do that .
you're not fooling anybody !
you're only fooling yourself ! .
why don't you walk?
i think i'll walk from here .
are you stalking me?
because that would be super .
my mom did want me to invite you to her tupperware party next week .
was that a
judges 'ruling .
uh huh .
yeah .
i do believe that was a joke .
i want to apologize for what richard did the other night .
it was a really immature stunt .
yeah , i know ... but sometimes guys can do some pretty childish things .
let us proceed .
is he ready?
ah , yeah , he's ready .
it's go time .
such a good boy .
oh , stop for a second .
stop .
okay .
keep going .
for the love of god .
smile , buddy .
lovely .
it's all about presentation , gentlemen .
well , i'll be damned !
poor guy just needed a little tlc .
i got it , guys .
no problem whatsoever .
let the damn baby have his ball back .
thank you , brothers .
it's not like he can see out of it anyway .
loser .
awesome work , sisters .
special delivery !

from the sisters of sigma theta tau .
dig in , guys .
oh , they're still warm .
so creamy .
they're awesome .
oh , they're so creamy .
god , these are excellent .
guys?
richard?
think i've had these before .
oh , my god !
i love this song .
i know .
it is the white barry .
is that for me?
i long to rub you the right way .
you're such a bad little badalandabad .
no harm , no foul .
are you all right?
never better , my jasmine flower .
that feels so good .
oh , my god .
take me .
i want you now .
now !
shit !
don't tease me .
this is the culmination of my being .
baby , i'm about to culminate .
now , get over here .
tajy , i'm so hot .
i feel on fire .
oh , yeah , me too , baby .
burning up .
oh , yeah , baby , i'm burning up .
you are most amazing to make me feel so ... damn hot !
i wonder how t bad's date's going .
scented candles , massage oils , barry white .
yeah , we can't be too far from climax , huh?
why do i always fail?
you put too much pressure on yourself .
don't worry about the money .
i'll figure something out .
more importantly ... when the time is right ... it'll happen .
you'll find the one .
i need to see the grade transcripts for van wilder , please .
i don't think so .
student transcripts are confidential .
sorry .
swim team really does need your love , folks .
and if milty mingleton can shove himself ... into that weenie bikini ...
then you don't need to be shy about making your donations now !
thank you , milty !
after we put all the water back in the pool ... we'll be accepting donations in the form of ... cash , visa and full frontal nudity .
hutch , take over .
that's right , folks .
save the swim team .
bikini clad judges for a fund raiser?
that's pretty ingenious .
sex sells , gwen .
sex sells .
it's not too late for you to enter the doubles breaststroke if you like .
no , thanks .
i forgot my suit .
i just came across a bit of interesting information .
all right , look .
the vet assured me that canine semen is perfectly healthy .
in fact , surprisingly rich
you've been 18 units shy of graduating for the past 6 semesters .
whoa .
you went klepto on my transcripts .
what's going on with you?
you're actively trying not to get out of here .
why are you doing this?
do you ever stop playing the in depth reporter?
i just want to know why you're putting off your life .
not for the paper .
for me .
i have no comment ... for either of you .
external occipital protuberance .
posterior gluteal line .
dorsal appendage .
gwen .
was the last one right?
yeah , that's right .
wrong !
the dorsal appendage exists only in marine equipped mammalia .
i knew you weren't listening .
what's wrong with you?
nothing .
i'm fine .
let's get out of here , go grab a beer .
are you insane?
you know my midterm and finals ritual .
i study till 11 : 00 .
nine solid hours of sleep .
protein shake in the morning .
okay , very cute .
and also correct .
which gives us 2 hours and 53 minutes of study time .
so , honey , please focus .
all righty?
i have confirmations from the african american club ... the gay and lesbian caucus , mecca , hepa , peta .
this multi coalition party was a masterful plan .
it should triple our income .
i just hope it's enough .
van , you must listen to me .
we are merely one party away from accomplishing our goal .
what if she's right , huh?
what if i'm avoiding graduation because i'm scared?
listen to yourself , meathead .
you've never doubted yourself in your whole life .
this girl's got you thinking , man .
it's not good .
not good at all .
hey , you !
please move banner a skosh higher , huh?
you got all this .
i'm gonna go
i'm gonna go make some calls for the party , okay?
hi , van .
hi , donna .
hey , guys .
what are you doing in here?
i had to talk to you .
i thought a lot about what you said , and
well , just just take a look at this .
yeah .
doodles .
i attended class today .
just about stayed the whole time too .
i'm glad you went to all your classes today .
and a few that weren't mine .
stepped into the wrong one .
liked what i heard , stayed .
that's great .
it really is .
it really is .
but don't do it for me .
do it for you .
maybe i'm doing it for both of us .
i shouldn't even be talking to you like this .
and i shouldn't be in the women's locker room !
but sometimes you gotta let your heart lead you ... even if you know it's someplace you know you're not supposed to be .
how often does your heart lead you into the women's locker room?
this would be a first .
why do i find that hard to believe?
i'm not saying i've never been in here before .
i'm saying it's usually a different part of my anatomy that does the leading .
oh , my god .
i just couldn't believe it .
gwen and van in the women's locker room .
i mean , i just couldn't believe it .
so anyway , let me tell you something .
i'm sorry , fellas .
the bakery's closed .
i'm here to enlist your services .
let me guess .
come as your favorite drunk on jis , come gargling frat boy party "?
then your mom can come .
it's gonna be a bachelor party .
one last night of debauchery with the fellas ... before settling down with my fiance , gwen .
oh , please , you didn't think she'd be interested in a fuckup like you?
that ought to be enough to get you started .
hello?
casey .
i'm just using gwen's computer .
is gwen there?
i need to talk to her .
she's at richard's getting ready for the engagement dinner tonight .
message?
nope .
that's all right .
bye .
thanks for coming .
lindsey and rob make such a great couple , don't you think?
yeah , i'm happy for them .
they're gonna make a great married couple too .
you know why?
because they love each other?
because they're compatible .
like a heart transplant patient finding a donor with the same blood type ... and just the right chromosomal anomalies .
a perfect match , connected forever .
but that would mean one of them would have to be dead .
gwenny , i'm just saying that they're a match .
just like you and me .
lucky girl .
gwendolyn elizabeth pearson ...
i'd be honored if you and i surgically and spiritually ... grafted our lives together .
richard , i don't know what to say .
just say yes , because i've got even more amazing news .
northwestern called this morning .
they wanna interview me .
they're gonna send some recruit alums to campus for written and oral exams .
and then i am in !
oh , man , northwestern .
that's great .
i'm so happy for you , richard .
be happy for both of us .
the richard and gwen life plan is kicking in .
northwestern .
i am the shit .
your father wants to get us a place in forest grove as an engagement present .
my parents know about this?
yeah , i told everyone .
where are you going?
i'm not sure , and for some reason ...
i feel really good about that .
i can't hold on
there's no easy way
hey , van , can i borrow
my god , what happened to you?
i got hit by a big truck .
are you okay?
i'm all out of love
i'm so lost without you
i know you were right
believing for so long
dope song .
what's it called?
gwen used me for her story , then married an ass wipe ... and ran over my heart with a big metaphorical truck .
originally performed by air supply .
who's air supply?
how old are you , sally?
i'm old enough to be jealous of that gwen girl .
okay , you can do this .
i'm all out of love
i'm so lost without you
i know you were right believing for so long
you must be gwen the truck driver .
hey .
excuse me .
gwen !
hey , hold up a second .
what are you doing here?
what am i doing here?
what were you doing in there?
as smashed as i am , i'm pretty sure that's my room , wasn't it?
what was that girl , a freshman?
she reads at a sophomore level .
this was a big mistake , van .
i'm leaving .
why are you here?
did you come to hire me to do your bachelorette party?
'cause your party pimp has already been booked by your fianc .
my fianc?
what are you talking about?
when are you two tying the knot?
seriously , i'd really like to hold that date open .
that is none of your business .
and you know what?
you're none of mine .
sounds to me like your rectal itch was getting a late night booty scratch .
first , my bitch turns down my proposal .
then she runs into that loser's arms .
now i don't even know where my bitch is .
wilder's got some big blowout tonight .
maybe your bitch is gonna be there .
you do not call her that , gonad !
hey , guys .
just giving you all the 411 .
i'm a counselor for the further leaders of america's overnighter .
the bus doesn't leave for a few hours .
is there anything i can do before i go?
anything at all?
okay , listen up .
we've got one quick stop off before we go .
tit wad !
all right , thank you , man .
enjoy yourself .
all right , sister .
enjoy yourself .
power to the people .
how you doing , my man?
what's up?
i hate to break this to you , ming , but you ain't asian .
man , you ever heard of tiger woods , bitch?
you better get out of here before i hit you upside the head with a three iron .
what's wrong with you?
enjoy yourself .
what's wrong , dog?
nothing .
i don't feel like partying .
that's a first .
hey , van .
i just wanted to come by and extend an olive branch .
id , please .
it's a terrible picture of me , but
well , i'll be the judge of
there's nothing fake about this id .
did you sit behind me two semesters ago?
i think i remember this behind .
i mean , you sitting behind me .
this whole rivalry thing has become a tad childish .
well , i hope we can put it all behind us and be friends .
that's what gwen wants .
you have absolutely no idea what gwen wants .
say hi to your gerbil for me .
okay , kids .
this is our uncle jger .
that's right .
drink up .
this tastes like shit .
do you have any scotch?
gotta go .
sorry .
bye .
bye bye .
call me .
gentlemen .
trooper .
we got an anonymous tip that there's some underage drinking going on here .
hutch?
hell no , man .
i've been at the door all night .
good enough for me .
have fun , guys .
all right , trapper .
stay cool .
i love you , man .
no , man .
i love you .
those circus midgets cannot hold their booze !
don't worry , van .
we'll get you out , man .
delta iota kappa rules !
damn it , gwen , pick it up .
i know you're there .
you know i have my northwestern interview next week .
look , i need you to help me " release " ... some pressure .
you know , help me " relax .
just so we're clear , i'm talking about intercourse .
i know you had a fling with wilder .
and it's okay .
you just had to get it out of your system .
i just hope you used some protection .
and i wouldn't want our future children to be tainted ... because mommy went slumming one night back in college .
why don't you go " release " your own pressure?
and just so we're clear , i'm telling you to go fuck yourself ! .
hi , partner in crime .
is there anything i can do for you today?
oh , my god !
we make such the fab team !
last night , i was so like bonnie and you were so like clyde .
and now this .
would you shut up?
i'm trying to pleasure you .
sorry , richard .
pleasure away .
ps , this is an awesome room .
ps , shut the fuck up !
here , i'm done with all of this .
the wilder story's not done .
read it before you criticize .
he got expelled today .
is that in your story?
'cause it should be .
is van here?
he don't wanna see you .
excuse me?
look .
why don't you just leave him alone?
home wrecker .
oh , thank you !
thank you !
out of my way !
stop packing !
you can appeal the expulsion .
it's in the school charter .
any student may appeal an expulsion before the university judicial board ... and state his or her case within 48 hours of being discharged .
do you want my hot tub , or should i just give it to milty?
we can get the law club to help .
they owe you after the " sue me , screw me " soiree you threw .
thank you .
i appreciate it .
i'm really not interested .
you're not hearing me  it's over , taj !
fuck you , van wilder !
you heard me .
i say i say ... fuck you , you you you you you you pussy ass motherfucker !
you you dicksucker !
don't sugar coat it , taj .
tell me how you really feel .
seven years .
seven years !
i've accomplished nothing !
there's no reason to stay here anymore !
sure , sure .
you've made tons of friends ... who in the drop of a rupee do anything for you , and that doesn't mean much?
who cares about sick boy and the charities you've helped ... and all of our athletics those are all so minuscule?
and i guess so is a promise ... made to a wet behind the ears kid from india whose only dream ... was to bury his face in a beautiful woman's lotus patch .
you have shown me a life i could only dream about ... back home while masturbating in my father's woodshed .
most importantly , you saw potential ... in me .
if you do not see potential in yourself , then you are a blind man .
i'm leaving .
then leave .
but leave the honorable way .
you've been looking for that dare to be great situation .
it is at your doorstep .
we need to talk .
get me the law club .
it's ridiculous !
it's preposterous !
it's ludicrous !
by god , it's impetuous !
so does that mean you gonna help us?
oh , it's on .
let van stay !
let van stay !
let van stay !
let van stay !
we are now in session .
mr. wilder .
you were found in violation of article 2 , section b of coolidge's bylaws soliciting of alcohol to extreme minors ... which is grounds for immediate expulsion .
you have opted to appeal .
the floor is yours .
ladies and gentlemen ...
as you know ...
i've been a student here for seven years , and i've
let van stay !
let van stay !
order !
order !
settle down , everyone .
continue , mr. wilder .
i'm okay .
i've learned a lot here at coolidge .
let the record show that ... when i attended class ...
i did receive exemplary marks .
however , it was only when i met a special someone ... that i realized what i was doing hiding .
see , after this is real life , and i wasn't ready for that .
i don't know why exactly .
i do know that i don't wanna end up like my father ... whose whole life revolves around work .
but i see that now .
and i'm ready to move on .
well , that's that .
good luck , loser .
who's ready for lunch?
mr. bagg , you will be quiet .
what's any of this got to do with ... that he's guilty of an infraction that deserves expulsion?
mr. wilder .
i can't argue against the infraction .
i was responsible for that party , so what happened was my fault .
i'm here to lay myself at the mercy of this court ... and suggest an alternative punishment .
make me graduate .
if you'll kindly take a look at my transcripts ... you'll see i'm 18 units from graduating with a leisure studies degree .
i am pleading to this committee , reinstate me .
let me audit my last six classes , take the finals ... and leave coolidge with a degree .
god , i've bled ... crimson and blue for nearly a decade .
this school has given me so much .
let me repay coolidge ... by parting ways as a graduate .
what are the courses mr. wilder needs in order to graduate?
biology , english lit , calculus , economics ...
sociology and political science .
wow .
that's quite a load .
well , van can handle quite a load .
if we expel him , there could be some sort of a coup d'tat .
he broke a rule .
he should pay the consequences .
well , let's take a vote .
there's five of us here .
majority rules .
i vote reinstatement .
mr. bagg?
expulsion .
miss haver?
reinstatement ... over and over .
okay .
mrs. seay?
expulsion .
professor mcdoogle?
you know , i've waited a long , long time for this day to come .
either way ...
van wilder's tenure here at coolidge is over .
let's see what the kid's made of .
he's in !
he's in !
hey , jeannie .
look .
i just wanted to explain about the whole , you know , richard thing .
me and richard's unspoken bond blossomed the other night in one beautiful ... symbiotic act .
what sort of act?
messing up that van wilder party .
and then we bumped uglies .
it was the best ten seconds ever .
ever .
yes , these interviews are somewhat of a formality ... but i think it's crucial we like minded people get to know one another .
i knew you'd come to your senses .
hello , richard .
look .
i know we have a lot of surgery to perform on our relationship .
but right now i am prepping for the biggest moment of our lives .
i have a written exam first , and then an interview with five northwestern alums .
all doctors .
that's why i came to help make you your shake .
that'd be terrific , gwenny .
i'll see you downstairs .
but hurry .
interview's in a half hour , other side of campus .
sorry about that .
northwestern .
i am the shit .
you certainly will be .
gwenny , thank you .
good luck , honey .
you deserve it .
i certainly do .
cytosine .
nothin 'but net , my man .
now remember , before any final , take a pregame dump .
thanks for coming in .
you did a great job , really .
richard !
i was just talking about you .
hey , surprise .
i'm on your oral exam board .
look , come in here .
i want you to meet your future alumni .
i gotta go  no , come on .
it's a great time .
look , it's richard .
finished his written exam in only 20 minutes .
this kid is a dynamo .
richard , i want you to meet dr. stern .
dr. fine .
it's a pleasure to meet you , mr. bagg .
i've heard a lot about you .
dr. brown .
this is something of a formality .
we just want to get to know you better .
and dr. smelnick .
richard , is there something you want to say?
you look like you want to get something out , son .
oh , my god !
vile .
oh , it burns !
i'm bleeding !
dear god , that's wretched .
oh , i kept the first for another day .
yet knowing how way leads on to way ...
i doubted if i should ever come back .
i want you to tell me what robert frost was trying to express here .
i'm gonna need at least one more booklet .
what?
in other school news ... we have an update on the " wilder watch .
the rigorous day has been a success for van the man .
five finals in the can with professor mcdoogle's advanced econ final to go .
van !
van , wake up , wake up , wake up .
your final's in exactly seven minutes !
all right .
it's the moment of truth , people .
i'm so glad you could fit us into your schedule this morning .
wouldn't miss it for the world , sir .
all right .
pass these out .
thank you .
it's getting to be that time of the hour .
and your time is up , mr. wilder .
pencils down .
thank you .
for four years ...
i have been grooming myself for the real world .
i , like many , define the real world as stuff that happens after graduation .
but i was wrong .
it took a man by the name of van wilder to teach me that .
you've all undoubtedly been to one of van's parties .
he's probably touched your life in some way , whether you know it or not .
watch van do belly flops into a pool ... but make sure you see he's raised $5, 000 to give the swim team a next season .
as you're all aware , van was almost expelled .
what you probably don't know is that he was set up ... by a pathetic , egomaniacal frat boy ... one who this reporter knows firsthand to have a serious problem ... with premature ejaculation .
and in reaction to this lynching ...
van put in more effort in six days than most have all semester .
win or lose , we should thank him for reminding us what we're all capable of .
that's simply what he does he inspires the uninspired .
van .
hurry .
the night of fun and fornication's upon us .
hey , have you heard from gwen?
no , she she hasn't yet called back .
right .
i'll be down in a minute , okay?
okay .
see ya , v.
jesus .
this is some pad you got here .
decorated in early fuck .
well , i made it a point to personally come down here , wilder .
i wanted to give you the results of your test firsthand .
and just as i expected ... you succeeded .
ninety one percent .
what?
i'm proud of you , wilder .
i've been waiting all these years for you to realize your potential .
that's why you and i had friction?
i thought it was 'cause i fooled around with your daughter freshman year .
why?
what you fooled around with my daughter?
what?
hey , i know you .
thank you very much .
you're the best , van .
hey , i couldn't have did it without you .
appreciate it .
i need you to fill this up with ice .
pack as much as you can inside .
okay?
excuse me .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
my name is orissa punjab nizamabad .
i've just transferred here from banglapur .
excuse me .
can you tell me ... where i might find the raddest fucking dude alive?
yeah , by the pool , gramps .
hey , i know you , man !
oh , fuck .
congratulations , van .
i knew you had it in you .
dad !
i can't believe you're here .
i can't believe you graduated .
a friend of yours ... sent me this .
i'm proud of you , van , graduation or no graduation .
thank you .
and i'm sorry that i spent ... such a buttload of your money for so long .
it's by far the best investment i ever made .
you did good .
let's get this man " leid .
meet my new girl .
you look so
wow .
wow .
i was hoping you'd say that .
may i?
as long as we cuddle afterwards .
there's so much that i need to say the article
i was scared that you wouldn't come .
well , i was trying to decide what panties i should wear .
which ones did you choose?
none .
it's gonna be a bachelor party .
one last night of debauchery with the fellas .
you can't even
i mean , this girl is
i was wondering  i'll do it .
i'm getting my shit together .
just one second .
i can't do this !
oh , man .
my mama never told me i'd be doing this .
i want to chew the
and then i don't know how .
kids , this is what white jockey blowin 'hookers will do to you .
