brigham signed it , all right .
i can't understand why he didn't tell me .
ah , he's like all them supervisors .
they think they're too good for regular people .
he says he was in here awhile ago and the place was a mess .
we'll hurry so we don't keep you out too long .
why can't i work with you in here?
we gotta cover the floor , the furniture , everything , so we don't spill on nothin '.
lf you want to sit in here with a tarp over your head , you're welcome to it .
how long will you be?
an hour or two at the most .
it's a small job .
we'll go in the side door here .
hiya , les .
uh , les , this is doyle lonnegan .
mr. lonnegan , this is les harmon .
how do you do?
could we , uh  what did you bring him here for?
i thought it would be a good idea for him to see the operation .
i'm having the place painted .
we can't talk in here now .
oh .
we'll have to find someplace else .
excuse me , mr. lonnegan .
miss barnes , i'm going home a little early .
lf there are any calls , tell them they can reach me here tomorrow morning .
mr. lonnegan?
i wanna see it one more time .
i can't do it .
we got telegraph inspectors all over the place .
one more time isn't gonna make much difference .
we got 400 grand coming in from the coast next week .
you gonna risk that on a lousy 15 g's?
lf it works again tomorrow , i'll finance the whole thing .
half a million dollars .
sixty forty , we split .
what are you talking we've already got a guy .
he's gonna give us half .
what am i supposed to say to him?
say to him what you want .
what i know about your operation , if i were you ,
i'd be worried about making me happy .
your guy says a week .
how do we know it won't be a month?
lonnegan here's a banker .
he can get the money without any questions asked .
we can't keep goin 'into shaw's place and cleanin 'up on long shots .
he's bound to get wise .
all right .
we'll go for short odds .
but it's still  you follow?
are you lieutenant william snyder?
i don't know .
what's up?
f. b. l .
special agent polk would like a few words with you .
you got a couple of minutes?
yeah , sure .
no , no , no .
it's got to be south of the river .
probably this section in here .
31st , 39th , morgan and halstead .
now , that's this section here .
now , let's break it into two sections along 35th .
what the hell is this?
i got work to do .
sit down and shut up , will ya?
try not to live up to all my expectations .
take two men with you .
work your way south from 31st to 35th , morgan and halstead .
go into every place and let me know what you find .
we've been told you know a hustle artist named johnny hooker .
you know him , or don't you?
yeah , but i don't know where he is .
well , we do .
he's chumming around with a big c named henry gondorff .
ring any bells?
every bunco man in the country knows gondorff .
well , there's word he's gonna run a con on the south side here .
we've got a year old florida warrant on him , but it's a thin beef .
he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold .
all we want you to do is pick up hooker for us .
why don't you pick him up yourself?
lf word gets out the feds are in on it , gondorff will fold up the whole thing .
wouldn't that be too bad .
then you'd have to move out of this nice office you've got here .
don't crack wise with me , flatfoot .
i spent too much time in dumps like this eating gondorff's dust ... while you guys in the bunco squads get rich tipping him off !
that's not gonna happen this time .
we're not gonna tell the police we're here .
you keep your mouth shut and do a job , there'll be reward bucks in it for you .
and you better take it , 'cause i can make you work for us without it .
what the hell good is hooker to you?
he's gonna set up gondorff for us .
he'll never do it .
i think he will .
he's there .
let's get on it .
what's the line on exponent?
uh ... 5 to 1 .
aah .
how's it going?
ah , nothing yet .
i had a good one on the lead at lincoln fields , but he faded .
best we had the last hour was love potion at rockingham , and she was 5 to 1 .
all the long shots coming in today .
take 4 to 1 if you have to .
okay .
you can forget the boodle , eddie .
he could hit us for 15 grand at 4 to 1 .
we can't handle that .
give him the shutout .
okay .
okay , billie , here we go .
at the wire , it's wrecking crew , the winner by five .
black mischief , second ; whichaway , third .
wrecking crew was ... 3 to 1 .

going into the backstretch , it's wrecking crew by two .
whichaway a half , black mischief and vale of tears driving on the outside .
nothin ', thank you .
what happened?
i didn't get the bet down in time .
jesus !
heading for home , it's wrecking crew all alone by six lengths ,
whichaway a length , and vale of tears .
it's wrecking crew , whichaway and black mischief .
and at the wire , wrecking crew wins it by six lengths .
black mischief is second by a head , whichaway is third , followed by vale of tears .
you should've had your money on wrecking crew .
it's raining and the track is sloppy at riverside park .

he'd like to kill me .
do me a favor .

yes , sir .
hello , hooker .
take them off .
special agent polk , f. b. l .
have a chair .
you want a drink or something?
no .
we want to talk to you about henry gondorff .
yeah?
i don't think i know him .
give yourself a couple of seconds .
you wouldn't want to lie to me .
lt. snyder here says you've done a lot of confidence work in his town .
oh , yeah?
lt. snyder doesn't know shit .
you ain't got nothin 'on me .
yeah?
how 'bout counterfeiting?
we've got a tip that gondorff is gonna run a con on the south side here .
all you've gotta do is tell us when he's gonna play his chump .
we come in at the sting , make the pinch , and ... you walk out free as a bird .
no .
you wanna spend the next 20 years in a federal penitentiary ... starting tonight?
i'll make parole .
like hell .
you won't even get a review .
i'll chance it .
okay . lf that's the way you want it .
we might even provide you with a little company on your way up the river .
that wife of luther coleman's what was her name?
alva .
alva .
that's it .
alva coleman .
pretty fair grifter in her time .
snyder's given us quite a folder on her .
nothing major by itself , but , uh , put 'em all together , it could add up to a lot of years .
you stink , mister .
don't be a sap .
it's not her i want .
lf you're too dumb to save yourself , there's no sense dragging her down with ya .
it's over , hooker .
you can save me a lot of trouble .
but i'm gonna get henry gondorff whether you help me out or not .
will you wait 'til the chump is played?
hell , yes .
we don't care about the mark .
he deserves what he gets .
i mean completely played .
you come in before we beat him , and i'll kill him .
all right , hooker .
but you try to take it on the lam , and we'll shoot you down on sight .
as long as i get to finish the play .
what is it , kid?
you're not saying much .
just got the jumps .
come in .
things are a little slow .
i wanna open the round for the girls .
sure .
take it easy , kid .
we're not gonna lose him now .
we had him ten years ago when he decided to be somebody .
believe me , i've seen enough to know .
ten .
twenty .
thirty .
go .
thirty one .
aagh .
how many guys you conned in your life , henry?
i don't know .
two , three hundred .
sometimes we played two a day when i was with o'shea's mob .
of course , chicago was a rigged town .
the fix was in ; the dicks took their end without a beef .
we had it down to a business .
and it really stunk , kid .
no sense in bein 'a grifter if it's the same thing as bein 'a citizen .
i got packin 'to do .
i'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow .
.. [ calliope ]
i wouldn't ask you to do this , you know , if it weren't for luther .
nothin's gonna make up for luther .
revenge is for suckers .
i've been griftin '30 years .
i never got any .
then why're you doin 'it?
it seems worthwhile , doesn't it?
see ya .
looks like he missed you .
yeah , yeah .
this time , anyway .
good night , mrs. hillard .
i was wonderin 'if you might want to come out for a while , maybe have a drink or something .
you move right along , don't you?
hey , i don't mean nothin 'by it .
i just don't know many regular girls , is all .
and you expect me to come out just like that?
lf i expected somethin ', i wouldn't still be standin 'here in the hall .
i don't even know you .
you know me .
i'm just like you .
it's 2 : 00 in the morning , and i don't know nobody .
come on , henry .
knock off .
you've done everything you can .
hmm .
yeah?
polk .
polk , this is hooker .
ready?
yeah , go ahead .
everything's all set .
there'll be a guy or two at the door .
nobody's carrying any heaters , so you shouldn't have any trouble .
okay .
see you there .
she was gonna kill you , kid .
her name's loretta salino .
lonnegan's people set her up in the diner .
come on .
let's get out of here .
come on !
come on !
she could have killed me last night .
too many people could have seen you go in her room .
she was a real professional .
used to work in the dutch schultz mob .
who are you?
gondorff asked me to look after you .
snyder , we just got a tip that gondorff's mark ... is some big new york wheel .
as soon as we're inside , you get him out of there fast ... before the reporters show up .
i don't want any big shots around to mess this up for me .
all right , let's go !
let's go , guys !
the flag is up , kid .
anytime , j. j. i'm workin 'on it .
we got one , billie .
here we go .

what's your problem?
i'm putting half a million dollars on lucky dan to win , third race at riverside .

ladies and gentlemen , this is arnold rowe calling the third race at riverside .
this is a claiming race for $1, 500 for three year olds and up .
