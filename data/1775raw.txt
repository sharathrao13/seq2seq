me , too .
take a pass .
oh , thank you .
both at a time when only a queen ...
all right , so the british are trying ... to reestablish authority over their precious colonies .
it's as if they're trying to assert ... a right that they couldn't quite exert .
assert and exert .
anybody know the difference between assert and exert?
what does it mean in this case?
anybody?
it means they could write the laws ... but they couldn't enforce them from 3, 000 miles away .
bingo , carlos .
they're 3, 000 miles away ... and they're trying to establish their authority ... over their colonies .
they are trying to reestablish ... their mercantilist philosophy ... which was , " we got colonies ...
and we're here to milk them .
how were they doing this?
well , grenville , the man in charge ... under george the third ...
once in a house on a hill
a boy got angry
he broke into my heart
so i came down the hill

to pull myself together
but if it's so good being free
what you are telling me
why i don't know what to do with myself

look how good our skin looks next to each other .
it's beautiful .
hmm .
who's that?
oh .
my mom .
she lives in virginia .
she's married to some dermatologist ... and the guy's home at 6 : 00 every night .
it's a big plus for my mom .
when she was married to my dad ... he was always running around trying to save the world .
no time for his family .
she left when i was 12 .
but it's good for my dad , he got to marry courtney ... and she's flush with cash from her first marriage .
my dad left when i was five .
he couldn't hack it here , so he went back to mexico .
i don't even have pictures of him .
you mad at him?
i hardly even think about him .
i got plenty of parent in my mom .
i got to go .
no , you don't .
you got to stay .
no .
my mother's going to kill me if i'm late .
tell her you're staying at a friend's house .
what friend?
i don't care .
make one up .
i'm not letting you leave .
when you hold me
like you do
it feels so right
drawn out
i start to forget
how my heart gets torn
when that hurt gets thrown
feeling like i can't go on
turning in circles
time and again
where are you going?
i got to go .
no .
stay .
i'll drive you .
shh .
got to know
for sure
'cause it takes something
more this time
than sweet , sweet lies
drawn out
before i open up my arms
and fall
losing all control
every dream inside my soul
this year's loving
it'll last
'cause who's to worry
if our hearts get torn
when that hurt gets thrown
don't you know this life goes on?
won't you kiss me
on that midnight sleep?
sweep me off my feet
singing ain't this life so sweet
this year's loving
it'll last
this year's loving
it'll last
this year's loving
it'll last
this year's loving
it'll last
this year's loving
it'll last
whoa , ah , yeah
this year's loving
it'll last [ laughing ]
i can't believe i just did that .
ah .
what am i doing with you?
i don't know .
what are you doing with me?
it's just a question .
look what you just got me to do .
ha ha !
i don't know , man .
when i'm with you , i never know what's going to happen .
it's weird because my life is so planned out , you know?
i don't know .
it's like you don't care what people think ... and when i'm with you ... you kind of make me not care what people think .
you know what i'm saying?
i know what you're saying .
i don't know .
and that dimple
i love that dimple .
i grew it myself .

yo , 'los , it's for you , man .
hello?

why'd you leave?
i'm so stupid .
i don't know what i was thinking coming there .
i'm sorry .
i should have told you it was gonna be like that .
that it was so formal .
no .
it wasn't that .
just seeing you with your family and friends ... and with that girl .
she's just a friend .
i don't care .
you should be able to do whatever you want .
i do what i want to do .
oh , god .
look at me , i'm pathetic !
i hate myself .
what are you talking about?
what?
it's just ... [ sighs ]
what?
what?
i just ...
i think i'm in love with you .
i'm sorry .
now i've weirded you out .
i'm sorry .
no .
i
don't say anything .
it's ok .
it's ok .
that's correct , sir .
he's leaving for washington , d. c. in five days .
mm hmm .
uh , well ...
no , he really doesn't have any other appointments .
i would stick with that one .
mm hmm .
certainly , sir .
take care .
yes .
yes , he is .
mr. nunez?
he's ready for you .
yeah .
i have it right here .
i think .
what is it?
a kid ... for gloria , right?
well , we start with the bienvenidos ... and then the red cross thing .
right?
and then you know , hon?
i have a meeting i need to start right now .
why don't we meet at king at 2 : 30?
ok?
well , you tell me then .
all right .
bye bye .
hey , carlos .
glad you could make it .
how are you?
ok .
how are you?
you know carter?
oh , yeah , yeah .
you ever work for habitat for humanity?
no .
it's a good project .
we got 25 houses up in one easter weekend .
and you know father boyle?
yeah .
i've heard of him .
he's an amazing man .
sit down .
we spent some time in boyle heights .
it's a tough neighborhood , huh?
yes , sir .
i imagine you've seen your share of friends ... sucked into " la vida loca .
yeah .
not just a ricky martin song .
no , sir .
so , what happened?
uh , what happened?
we were supposed to have a meeting last week .
i don't know .
i got the bus schedule all screwed up ... and it was too late .
you could have called to say you weren't coming .
i i did call .
maybe she just didn't get you the message .
the lady .
maria !
maria !
yes?
did mr. nunez call last week to say he wasn't coming in?
not to me .
should i ask sandy?
no , that's ok .
i'm more than happy to use my connections ... to help someone get a foot in the door ... but i have absolutely no patience ... with individuals who will not participate in the process .
i can't do this alone .
mr. oakley , um ...
i really appreciate you seeing me today .
ok .
i think i know what's going on here .
i know the powerful effect nicole can have on people .
she's absolutely fabulous ... at taking a perfectly oiled train ... and running it right off the tracks .
now , i do love her .
unconditionally .
that goes without saying .
but she can be so destructive .
and volatile .
and , um , the anger ... ever since ...
well , to be 12 years old ... and to find your mother like that ...
i think when nicole's mother took her own life ...
nicole decided then and there ... that she would never , ever trust anyone again .
and it was her against the world ... and god forbid anybody should try and help her .
she's persona non grata ... with half the psychiatrists on the westside .
a lot of them have recommended that i send her to ... one of those behavior modification schools ... but i ...
she's tried to kill herself a number of times ... but what can i do?
she lies and she drinks .
she does drugs .
she hates me .
hates her step mother .
mr. oakley [ sighs ]
ahh , nothing .
i'm sorry .
i shouldn't be telling you about this ... but you seem like such a good person .
such a decent person .
now , you want me to write this recommendation?
you want me to put myself on the line?
well , i want you to listen to my advice .
now , stay away from my daughter .
you hear me?
for your own good , for my peace of mind ... stay away from nicole .
you know , it's a painful thing for a father to ... have to acknowledge a truth about their own child .
it's taken me a long time to accept who she is .
and who she's never gonna be .
well , i could sleep forever
but it's of her i dream
if i could sleep forever
i could forget about everything
we got a party , man .
hey , carlos ... all them honeys gonna be there , man .
they gonna be checking us out !
hey .
ha ha .
hey .
so , what happened?
when?
you didn't call me .
oh , i got home late .
i just had stuff to do .
well , what'd he say?
i'll see you guys later .
all right .
what happened?
no , nothing .
he just said he'd write me a recommendation .
but what did he say?
about what?
about me .
nothing .
come on , just tell me what he said .
i really don't want to get in the middle
in the middle of what?
look , i just need to focus right now .
you need to focus?
i can't afford to mess up , man .
i told you that .
my mom's all over me 'cause i'm never around ... and my grades are for shit .
i could hardly keep my eyes open at practice .
all i want to do is sleep for more than four hours straight .
i'm sorry for messing up your life .
i just need to remember what's important .
what's important to you?
my priorities .
what did he tell you?
he told me to stay away from you .
that you were trouble and you'd just mess me up .
and what did you say?
i just ...
i see .
every time
it's time to call [ sobbing ]
in many ways
every dream
gets broken over
with little time
i will fly within your sky
every time
you start to call
and on the way
all destruction is my wine
though it's sad and lonely
there's a whole life waiting after dawn
gonna slide
you can be anywhere when your life begins .
you find the right person , then ... all of a sudden , anything's possible .
i'm eating , mom .
i'm just trying to figure this out .
chemistry homework .
hello?
hola , mrs. nunez .
soy luz .
no estoy aqui .
don't tell her i'm here .
i told you , mom , i don't want to talk to her .
because i don't want to .
mira .
tu comida .
i'll eat it later .
ay , muchacho .
yeah !
hello?

i'm just having a good time , ok?
and you need to focus .
nicole , i really have to
get off the phone and in the hot tub , girl .

nicole , i just want to [ dial tone ]
take your time .
yeah , hold on .
i'm uncomfortable with myself
carlos !

what's up , baby?
yo , get him a tequila .
girl , put a titty in his mouth .
don't you know when to flake
and i am not doing all right
and i am not doing all right
none of this makes sense
they don't support me ...
come on , nicole , let's go .
whoa , stud .
i was just trying to get a taste , man .
shut up , davis , before i kick your ass !
hey , man , what's your problem?

we stopped this young man driving your daughter's car .
she was intoxicated and combative .
we found drug paraphernalia ... and alcoholic beverage containers in the vehicle .
christ .
we thought we'd give you the courtesy ... of dealing with her yourself .
now , we could put a scare into her ... and let her spend the night in jail .
no .
thank you , officer .
i can handle this .
no , you can't handle it !
nicole , just calm down .
calm down?
everything will be all right .

not yours .
thank god for that .
this is
carlos , please , what did i tell you?
just go away .
please .
just leave .
go .
you hear me?
why do you hate me so much?
how could you tell the one person in the world ... that i love , that i care about so much ... how could you tell him to stay away from me?
do you think the only thing i'll do to anyone ... is screw them up?
do you think that i'm not worth loving?
nicole  carlos , this is our problem .
it's our problem , not yours .
just leave .
go .
come on , son , let's go .
honey , listen , come on to the house
leave me alone !
just leave me alone .
just come in the house , nicole .
no .
just get in the house .
jesus christ .
christened life
somehow i found you here
torn from the hope and fear
hold us inside
you pulled me out
up from the world i've known
and all that was broken and cold
you brought me here [ bell rings ]
the mid term counts for 25 % of your grade ... so i want you to pull your thoughts together ...
can i help you?
faith in the life we've done
ok , where was i?
it holds us inside
ohh
from you , one look
just one look
and everything is shattered
from you , one word
stars burn and fall
oh
oh
carlos .
you need something?
from you , one look
just one look
where you going?
and everything is shattered
yo , you got a pass .
hello?
towers burn and fall
fall , fall
from you , one look ...
what's going on?
packing .
where are you going?
oh .
i'm going to the turnabout ranch ... in lovely escalante , utah ... and i get to be escorted by a lovely gentleman ... who's waiting for me in the principal's office .
so it looks like i get to go to boot camp before you do .
sorry for being so dramatic the other night .
it was stupid .
i'm sorry for not
don't say anything .
you couldn't do anything .
you were smart not to say anything .
so , mr. nunez ... it was great knowing you .
i hope you have a wonderful life .
let's leave .
what?
let's get out of here right now .
aren't you in the middle of an exam?
like right now?
so?
i'm not gonna let you walk out of your mid term .
i already did .
annapolis is gonna look at these grades .
you're not listening to me .
i wanna be with you .
i don't give a shit about anything else right now .
mid terms , grades , annapolis , your father .
i want to be with you .
do you want to be with me?
i love you .
don't just say that because
shut up .
i love you , ok?
you know , this guy in the office ... he's pretty damn big .
ha ha !
then ...
let's go out on sunset .
oh .
ha , ha , ha !
come on !
i'm coming !
i imagine long walks down the road [ nicole laughing ]
things begin to bloom and the sky explodes
the damage is undone
then i know
this has got to be a dream
machines and luxuries don't last
here .
you can wear this .
and i woke up half dead in the hourglass
now , does that sound funny
wait , you're almost there
it's gone
you're almost there , it's gone
you're almost where what follows you
does not bother you
i have walked the tightrope parts of me
toed the line just far enough to see
never found the gift i got for free
you pay for them dearly
i see my forever as one long night
and if i could make it dark
i could make it light
i know that most of living done ...
don't be writing on my back .
only thought survives
wait , you're almost there
it's gone
aah !
almost where what follows you
does not [ camera shutter clicks ]
what are you doing?
you'll see .
that's pretty cool .
my shrine to carlos .
can i see more of it?
yeah , sure .
my suicide notes .
creative , huh?
that's your mother , isn't it?
yeah .
she ... she was in bed asleep , i thought ... so i went downstairs ... and i stayed real quiet all afternoon ... so i wouldn't disturb her .
and then i went back up ... and she was still lying there .
my dad thinks we're the same person .
did he say that?
he doesn't need to .
what else am i supposed to think ... except i'm gonna end up like her?
it's genetics , right?
your father , though ... he really loves you .
he does .
no , he doesn't .
nicole , listen to me .
he really loves you .
he just doesn't know how to handle you .
i think you scare him .
i scare him?
you do .
i mean , you scare me sometimes .
i scare you?
yes .
i mean , you ...
how do i scare you?
you just get out of control .
i do not .
yes , you do .
what are you talking about?
you know what i'm talking about .
i'm 17 .
i'm supposed to get out of control .
i guess .
my dad , he doesn't understand me or ... anything about me .
have you tried talking to him?
yeah .
sober?
shut up .
doesn't happen , does it?
i'm not always drunk .
hey .
what are you doing out here?
i want to be good for you .
you are good for me .
not if i keep taking you away ... from everything you've worked so hard for .
i want to make things better for once ... not worse .
'cause i really want to be with you .
i can't keep running away from things .
i'm here for you .
i know you are .
well , do you have a 310 listing for j. foster?
no listing , sir .
well , try b. foster at 818 .
f o s t e r .
no , sir .
there's no foster in 818 .
should i try the 310 again?
sir?
i'm trying to help you , sir .
hello?
well , i've been up all night .
trying to call everybody .
i called maddy and lainie and your friend foster ... who apparently doesn't believe in telephones .
honey , i know you don't want to go to this school ... but it's supposed to be extraordinary .
marty sheen says it's top notch .
dad , i'll
you'll have your own horse .
my own horse?
well , you like horses , don't you?
when i was eight .
well , the counselor said that he warned me you would try to talk your way out of it .
he said there's a danger of us getting drawn back ... into old patterns and destructive behavior ... and that we should spend our time focusing on ... conversations that focus on " we " versus " me .
this is " we .
oh .
well , good .
good .
i'll go wherever you want me to go .
i mean , i know i'm a mess .
no , you're not a mess .
no , i am .
i am a mess .
and i'd probably send me away , too .
you've got morgan now ... and you're gonna do it right this time .
i just wish i wasn't the child ... that everybody learned what not to do from .
that's not who you are .
i know i remind you of mom .
everything that went wrong ... but sometimes you look at me like you wish i wasn't there .
like you wish i'd just disappear .
and it just hurts so bad .
i know i'm not easy to love ... but could you try anyway?
i do love you .
i love you so much .
i'm frightened for you every minute .
every minute .
and i need help .
i can't do it alone .
tom , honey?
morgan's got her swim class .
it starts in 10 minutes .
what's going on?
that's what we're trying to figure out here .
what do you mean figure out?
didn't we agree on a plan of action?
rosa?
would you please put morgan in the car?
thank you .
yes , right now .
oh , my god .
this is not gonna start up all over again .
she needs discipline .
children need limits .
they want limits !
so we'll set them .
we already have !
she's going to that school in utah .
no .
i am not the bad guy .
this is not about me .
i have a child that i'm thinking of .
so do i. two children .
oh , nic ...
nicole , i just don't think i can live with you .
i know i can't live without her .
we have to be at pepperdine in ten minutes , tom .
i'm talking to my daughter .
it's morgan's very first swim class .
i'm talking to my daughter .
nicole , i just want morgan ... to have an older sister that she can look up to .
me , too .
that's all right .
i've got her now .
she's not like mom .
no .
god , your mom was an amazing woman .
she loved you very much .
i wish i remembered her better .
hmm .
we should talk about her more .
we will , honey .
we will .
before you say anything , sir ...
i just want you to know that i love your daughter , sir .
you don't have to
she has so much beauty , so much honesty ... and i love her so much .
carlos , stop .
now , i have something to say .
thank you .
for what?
for not listening to me .
for sticking around .
annapolis is gonna be lucky to get you .
but i had a speech .
i had a pretty good speech .
i bet you did .
you want to hear it anyways?
why don't you tell it to her?
seems to be doing pretty good .
how did that happen?
how did you do that?
do what?
i wasn't even there .
yes , you were .
you were so there .
i want to believe in
i want to believe in us
there are millions of people out there ... but , in the end , it all comes down to one .
i still panic sometimes , forget to breathe ... but i know ...
i know there's something beautiful ... in all my imperfections .
a beauty which he held up for me to see .
a strength that can never be taken away .
i'm going out to see him next week ... but until then ... there's one photo i keep with me all the time .
i believe in us
everyone falls
but not everyone rises
why don't you get up
and rise again for me
what if the world were a little more perfect
would you stop crying
would you take the leap
now , what if the world were a little more perfect
would you open your eyes
and blink again for me
for me
yeah , for me
what about friendship
what about friends
you said the whole world was against you
it all had to end
what about love
what about family
what about all that you have to live for
what if the world were a little more perfect
would you stop crying
would you take the leap
what if the world were a little more perfect
would you open your eyes
and blink again for me
for me
and blink again for me
for me
it isn't easy here without you
why did you leave me
what am i supposed to do
without you
without you
and what if the world were a little more perfect
would you stop crying
would you take the leap
what if the world were a little more perfect
would you open your eyes
and what if the world were a little more perfect
would you stop crying
would you take the leap
what if the world were a little more perfect
could you open your eyes
and blink again for me
for me
ooh
for me
for me , for me
