it's nice to know i can still make you laugh .
i like to laugh , fred .
that's why i married you .
you can wake me up when you get home if you want to .
what is that?
a videotape .
i found it outside on the steps .
who's it from?
i don't know .
there isn't anything on the envelope .
does it say anything on the tape?
no .
nothing .
well , see what's on it .

must be from a real estate agent .
maybe .
it's ok .
it's ok .
it's ok .
i had a dream last night .
you were inside the house ...
you were calling my name ...
fred !
fred !
where are you?
i couldn't find you .
then there you were ... ... lying in bed .
it wasn't you .
it looked like you , but it wasn't .
fred , are you all right?
you're up early .
that dog woke me .
who the hell owns that dog?
what's that?
another videotape .
yes .
don't you want to watch it?
i guess so .
well , don't you want to watch it?
yeah .
it's the same thing .
no , it isn't .
fred?
what?
we have to call the police .
that's right .
yes .
someone broke in and taped us while we slept .
isn't that enough?
7035 hollis .
near the observatory .
yes .
we'll be here .
so?
they're sending 2 detectives out .
that's it .
what do you think .
i really don't know .
let's check the hallway and the bedroom .
this is the bedroom?
you sleep here in this room .
both of yous .
this is our bedroom .
there's no other bedroom?
no .
i mean , i use it as a practice room .
it's soundproof .
you're a musician?
yeah .
what's your axe?
tenor .
tenor saxophone .
do you ...
no ...
tone deaf .
do you own a video camera?
no .
fred hates them .
i like to remember things my own way .
what do you mean by that?
how i remembered them ...
not necessarily the way they happened .
you have an alarm system?
yes .
actually , we do .
but we haven't been using it lately .
why not?
it kept going off ...
for some reason .
false alarms .
might want to try and use it again .
yeah .
ok?
we're going to check the windows and doors , see if anybody tried to break in .
we'll keep watch over the house .
we'll do the best we can .
if anything else happens , you'll call us .
we will .

dick can't be dead .
who told you he was dead?
who , honey?

we're leaving now .
we never should have come here in the first place .

we met at a place called moke's .
we became friends .
he told me about a job .

good looking blonde .
she stayed in the car .
her name is alice . i swear , i love that girl to death .
if i ever found out somebody was making out with her ...
i'd take this and i'd shove it so far up his ass , it would come out his mouth .

i'm not positive , but he knows .
so ... what are we supposed to do?
i don't know .
if we could just get some money , we could go away together .
i know a guy .
he pays girls to party with him .
he's always got a lot of cash .
he'd be easy to rob .
then we'd have the money .
we could go away .
we could be together .
have you partied with him?
did you like it?
no .
it was part of the deal .
what deal?
he works for mr. eddy .
yeah?
and what's he do?
he makes films for mr. eddy .
pornos?

it was a long time ago .
i met this guy at a place called moke's .
we became friends .
he told me about a job .
in pornos?
no .
just a job .
i didn't know what .
he made an appointment for me to see a man .
i went to this place .
they made me wait there forever .
there was a guy guarding the door .
in another room , there was this other guy lifting weights .
i started getting nervous .
when it got dark ... ... they brought me into this other room .
why didn't you just leave?
you liked it , huh?
if you want me to go away , i'll go away .
i don't want you to go away .
i don't want you to go away .
i love you , alice .

i'll set it up for tomorrow night .
you meet me at his place at 11 : 00 .
don't drive , take the bus .
make sure no one follows you .
his address is easy to remember .
it's 2224 deep dell place .
it's a white stucco job on the south side of the street .
i'll be upstairs with andy .
the back door will be open .

in the east , the far east ... ... when a person is sentenced to death , they're sent to a place where they can't escape .
never knowing when an executioner may step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head .
what's going on?
it's been a pleasure talking to you .
