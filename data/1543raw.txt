somebody's coming , pa .
well ...
let him come .
hope you don't mind my cutting through your place .
no , i guess not .
i'm heading north .
didn't expect to find any fences around here .
hello , boy .
you were watching me , weren't you?
yes , i was .
i like a man who watches things goin 'around .
it means he'll make his mark some day .
long time since i've seen a jersey cow .
you'll see a lot more .
jerseys and holsteins ... ... and the like .
can i offer you some water?
thanks .
you're a little touchy .
joey !
you know not to point guns at people .
i wasn't pointing at anybody , mother .
sure had me snortin ', son .
i just wanted you to see my rifle .
bet you can shoot .
can't you?
little bit .
looks like your friends are a little late .
what are the ryker boys up to this time?
rykers?
that's what i said .
i wouldn't know a ryker from your jersey cow .
don't forget to close the gate on your way out .
would you put down that gun?
then i'll leave .
what's the difference?
you're leaving anyway .
i'd like it to be my idea .
howdy , starrett .
expectin 'trouble?
i don't want no trouble , starrett .
i came to inform you .
i got that reservation beef contract .
so many to tell me that?
i mean business .
then , tend to your own .
that's just what i'm doin '.
i'm gonna need all my range .
now you've warned me , get off my place .
your place?
you'll have to get out before the snow .
supposin 'i don't?
you and the other squatters .
homesteaders , you mean .
i could blast you outta here right now .
listen to me .
the time for gun blastin 'a man off his place is passed .
they're building a penitentiary ...
joe , that's enough .
who are you , stranger?
i'm a friend of starrett's .
well , starrett , you can't say i didn't warn you .
all right , you've told me .
now get off my claim .
supper'll be ready in a little while , joe .
won't be very long .
wait , mister , i ...
i swear , i ...
wait a minute , please .
i take that back , what i ...
look , this ... this thing ain't even loaded .
not loaded?
no , joey's too young to go loaded .
that's his gun .
if this don't beat all !
my name is starrett , joe starrett , and this here's joey .
you heard what my little woman said .
come on in , i feel like eatin '.
you can call me shane .
guess i spook kinda easy these days .
hello , joe .
my place ain't very much yet , but my wife sure can cook !
it won't be long till supper .
you can wash up right here .
in case you wanted to know , that's ryker's spread all over there .
he thinks the whole world belongs to him .
the old timers can't see it yet , but runnin 'cattle on an open range can't go on .
it takes too much space for too little results .
those herds aren't any good , they're all horns and bone .
cattle that is bred for meat and fenced in and fed right , that's the thing .
you gotta pick your spot , get your land , your own land .
a homesteader can't run but a few beef , but he can grow grain , and then with his garden and hogs and milk , he'll be all right .
we make out , don't we , marian?
of course .
it's that calf again .
joey , chase her out of there .
joey !
run on , son .
don't forget to shut that gate .
joey !
come on , shoo !
i wouldn't ask you where you're bound .
one place or another .
some place i've never been .
the only way i'll leave is in a pine box .
what do you mean , pa?
i mean they'll have to shoot me and carry me out .
you shouldn't talk like that .
it's the truth .
you love this place .
we've got our roots down .
i wish you wouldn't talk that way .
our first real home .
what did you mean ...?
joey , be quiet .
the men want to talk .
there's just more work here than i can do .
if i could hire me a man that ...
i had one once , but the rykers roughed him up , so he lit out , cussin 'me ...
they knocked his teeth out .
ready for pie?
if nobody else is gonna eat this biscuit , i guess i'll have to .
we're kind of fancy , aren't we?
what is , pa?
good plates , an extra fork ...
what about me , ma?
what's the matter , marian?
nothing .
that was an elegant dinner , mrs starrett .
excuse me .
where's mr shane going?
he didn't even say goodbye .
he's not going , joey .
he wouldn't go without taking that .
i'm going outside with him .
did you ask him to stay the night?
i'll do that right now .
well , i'll be doggone .
come here a minute .
joe , why don't you hitch up the team?
marian , i've been fighting this stump off and on for two years .
use the team now , this stump could say it beat us .
sometimes nothing will do but your own sweat and muscle .
all right .
bang !
bang !
i wish they'd give me some bullets for this gun .
good morning , joey .
how did you know it was me?
well , i figured the cow couldn't work that latch .
why are you up so early?
you're to stay for breakfast .
oh ...
well , thank you .
then where will you go?
where would you say , joey?
i wish you'd stay here .
would you teach me to shoot?
you'd like to learn to shoot?
pa wishes you'd stay , too .
i heard him tell mother .
he said he didn't want you to fight his fights for him , just help with the work .
i bet you wouldn't leave just because it's dangerous .
joey !
joey , come here this minute .
i hope you'll stay , mr shane .
coming , mother !
close the gate , joey .
what are you doing in your nightshirt?
come in and put your clothes on .
would you like to hitch up the team and haul that wire from grafton's?
anything you say .
get off the bed .
go on !
he's holding it for me at the store .
while you're there , you might as well get yourself some work clothes .
what can i bring joey?
soda pop !
you don't need anything , joey .
be careful .
i don't want my troubles to be none of yours .
aren't you wearing your six shooter?
i didn't know there was any wild game in town , joey .
come on , son .
joey , come back here !
bang !
bang !
who are you shootin 'at?
rykers .
bang !
did you get many?
missed one .
well , can't stand for that .
pa , do you guess shane will teach me to shoot?
i'll teach you myself once i get the time , joey .
can you shoot as good as shane?
i've never seen him shoot .
but i doubt it .
he didn't wear his gun today .
why's that , pa?
well , he's tradin 'at the store , not holdin 'it up .
but why , pa?
honest , why didn't he?
i don't wear one myself .
it goes with him , though .
somebody's coming , joe .
i know .
it's ernie wright .
could you whip him , pa?
could you whip shane?
can't you ask nothing but questions?
but could you?
oh , maybe .
no call for that though , joey .
shane's on our side .
howdy , joe .
how are you , ernie?
no good .
what's the matter?
i'm pulling stakes .
no use of your talking .
now what's the matter?
my wheat .
them rykers raided it .
fence cut , steers drove in .
it's just stubs now .
when?
last night .
i'm leaving , and don't try to talk me out of it .
you can't ...
just don't try , that's all .
i listened to you too much already .
go ahead , nobody's holding you .
you wouldn't leave your home and land , and ...
oh , ernie , you ...
i'm wore down and out .
tired of being insulted by them fellas .
called a pig farmer .
who knows what comes next?
well , don't throw your tail up .
tell you what , we'll all get together here tonight and figure out something .
i don't know about me .
i'll get the word around .
you tell shipstead and torrey .
all right , but if we're having a meeting , it'd better be more than pokin 'holes in the air with your finger .
anything i can do you for?
i came to get wire for joe starrett .
i've been holding wire for starrett for quite a spell .
are you new?
yes , i'm working for starrett .
got ready made pants to fit me?
farm rig?
i outfit all these farmers .
step right in back and try 'em on .
thanks .
will .
hey , will .
you're thirsty , ain't you , chris?
will !
who's tendin 'bar round here?
comin 'right in .
how is it?
good enough .
how much do i owe you?
now , let's see ...
pants , a dollar .
two shirts , 60 cents .
belt ...
young man , you owe me two dollars and two bits .
what's the matter , son?
you look kinda pale .
been a long time since i got store bought clothes .
money don't go very far these days .
a new sodbuster?
thought i smelled pigs .
anything else?
got any soda pop?
i sure do .
i wish more men around here would drink it .
in my bar , in there .
thanks .
will !
let's keep the smell of pigs out from where we're drinking .
bartender .
what can i do for you?
do you have any soda pop?
are you gonna get him out or do i have to?
let me take him , chris .
what'll it be?
lemon , strawberry or lilac , sodbuster?
you speaking to me?
i don't see nobody else standing there .
here , have some of this .
smell like a man .
don't it smell better in here , grafton?
chris just fumigated a sodbuster .
just take it easy .
i was just asking about sody pop , pigs and taters and one thing and another .
which one of them tater pickers are you working for?
or are you just squatting on the range?
joe starrett , if it's any of your business .
supposing i make it my business?
here's your soda pop , mister .
now you and your soda pop get outta here and stay outta here .
and don't come back !
did you see that , rufe?
chris just put the run on a sodbuster .
that's it .
keep 'em on the move .
warm it up for you?
it's getting so i don't like to ride at night .
let's hope the meeting starts ...
is shane going to be at the meeting?
mr shane .
yes , i suppose so .
we all know why we're here .
ryker's war party's been around to see all of us .
i'm here to tell you , i ain't leavin 'now or any other time .
start with you , axel .
what do you say?
well , joe , you see ...
i know what i want to say .
start with me .
ernie , we're gonna hear everybody in turn .
go ahead .
most of you don't know shane .
shane , this is yank potts .
howdy .
fred lewis here .
i seen you in town .
ernie wright here , and ed howells .
and johnson .
howdy , shane .
see anybody else coming?
no .
we're waiting for torrey .
how far is ryker gonna push us?
let's not talk scared , that's what ryker wants .
he thinks he can shoo us off like a flock of chickens .
here's torrey .
hello , reb .
hello , yank .
about time you showed up .
that's enough out of you , yank .
and you , too .
all right .
cool off , stonewall .
shake hands with shane , there .
shane's working for me .
shane .
oh , yeah ...
i heard about you , at grafton's .
go on , joe .
well , stonewall , it's like this ...
leaving ernie out , maybe , we've all agreed we're gonna stick .
now you're whistling .
ain't nobody pushing me off my claim .
i think you all know that i'm staying .
i , too , will stay .
i'll string along , leastways till the shooting starts .
there ain't but seven of us , if it comes to a fight .
him .
that's eight .
can't count on him .
he's proved that much .
watch what you're saying .
shane can tell you what happened with ryker's man , chris .
they're talking about shane !
what is this , shane?
let him say .
lewis seen and heard it .
he let chris buffalo him at grafton's .
fred , i told shane to stay away from trouble .
let's finish the story .
he didn't .
shane didn't let him do that !
this chris went around bragging he put the run on a sodbuster .
shane , you don't have to leave .
i figured you could talk freer if i weren't around .
it's too late to finish this now .
he didn't , did he?
joey , i want you to go to sleep .
it's all right , everything's all right .
shane isn't going away?
no , he isn't .
now , get back into bed .
stay there .
shane .
shane !
i know you ain't afraid .
it's a long story , joey .
i think we know ... ... shane .
don't stand in the rain .
you'll catch your death of cold !
so , on saturday , we'll get together and go into town for our supplies .
that's a good idea .
there's some strength in a whole bunch .
i don't need no bodyguard .
i'll put on my . 38 and go when i please .
joey .
yes?
don't get to liking shane too much .
why not?
i don't want you to .
is there anything wrong with him?
no .
then what , mother?
he'll be moving on one day , joey .
you'll be upset , if you get to liking him too much .
marian , you're pretty enough , come on !
i'm coming !
i wish she'd hurry so we could get going .
i don't like this business .
get in the wagon , son .
one thing a married man has to get used to is waiting for women .
hurry up , ma !
here she comes .
good afternoon .
hello .
sometimes the waiting is worth it .
take care and get a woman worth waiting for .
water's good .
think i can get ready as quickly as you?
hold your horses , we wanted to see how pretty you were .
come on here .
all set?
come on , girls !
hello !
morning .
are you all set?
reckon we are .
hello , marian !
where's stonewall?
he got thirsty and went on in .
said he had business that couldn't wait .
i got to stay and mind the girls .
bye !
bye !
come on , red .
bye , marian !
stonewall , what are you doing?
we agreed to come together .
i had a little business to attend to .
we can't buy a drink .
get down off that horse .
you're acting like a darn fool .
a whole bunch came in .
they brought their women to protect them .
my jars come yet?
howdy , starrett .
what can i do you for?
my , my , my ... !
what will they think of next?
susan !
did you bring your mother's list?
yes , pa .
get the coal oil can from the wagon .
my woman want we get together on the fourth of july .
we make big celebration , don't we , marian?
fine , that's just what we need .
it's joe starrett's anniversary , the fourth of july .
we'll have a big party .
mr grafton ...
have you got gunpowder for the fireworks?
how about some of those jellies ...?
we'll talk about that later .
what do i get for the empty?
the usual .
thank you .
give the bottle to will .
i need some white flour , mr grafton , and four pounds of coffee .
joey .
let me take it in .
you come , too , shane .
thank you .
well , now look here what we got .
that's one of the new ones .
they call him sody pop .
deal me out .
what's the matter , pete?
just say i'm superstitious , that's all .
i guess you don't hear very well , sodbuster .
i told you , if you want to keep healthy , stay out of here .
now , get going .
look , pig farmer .
get back with the women and kids , where it's safe .
don't push it , calloway .
did you hear me?
i said get going .
did you think you were gonna come and drink with the men?
set 'em up , bartender .
two whiskies .
you bought me a drink last time i was in here .
now i want to buy you one .
you ain't gonna drink that in here .
you guessed it .
let me have him .
let him go .
let me have him .
go get him , chris .
tear him apart !
get that sodbuster .
hang one on him , chris .
bust him .
break his back .
this is bad , this is bad .
i'm going in there .
no , stonewall , stay right here .
if we join in , we'll get run out .
go on !
go get him , chris .
there ain't a marshal within a hundred mile ride .
get after him , chris .
plough him under , chris .
beat his brains out !
get him !
land that right , chris .
knock him into that pigpen , chris !
dirty pig farmer !
stop this !
go on , get at it .
here , men , stop this !
settle it outside .
looks like it's all over .
we should get out of here .
maybe you'd like to draw straws .
hold on , young fella .
you may have a friend you don't know you've got .
i could use a man like you .
i'm working for starrett .
you don't belong on the end of a shovel .
anything to stop you drawin 'your time?
i like working for starrett .
whatever he's paying , i'll double .
it's no use .
what are you looking for?
nothing .
pretty wife , starrett's got .
you dirty old man !
people don't talk to me that way .
i'm talking that way .
you had a chance .
nobody messes up my boys and gets away with it .
we'll ride you out of this valley .
gonna rough you up and ride you out and you're gonna stay out .
shane , come on !
joey , get out of here .
but , shane , there's too many .
you wouldn't want me to run away , would you?
but there's too many , shane .
go on , son , please .
stop !
i'll pay the damages .
no more fighting .
keep outta this .
this man's unarmed .
it ain't a shooting .
quit butting in .
i'll take him .
stop it , men !
stop fighting !
stop it , men .
stop this !
break his neck !
where's joey?
pa , they're going to kill shane !
they're trying to kill him !
stay with your mother .
don't go in .
shane's in there .
what ryker's got coming ain't fit for a woman to see .
don't go in there , joe ...
beat his brains in !
stop it !
stop it !
stop it !
you fools have had enough of it .
you'll all get killed .
starrett , you and shane back on out of here .
that's making some sense , starrett .
you've won .
get out of here .
ryker ain't paying for this damage .
i'm paying for what's broke .
no , by godfrey , we're paying for what's broke , me and shane !
morgan , put one of the boys on a good horse .
he's got a long trip , all the way to cheyenne .
i'm through fooling , grafton .
from now on , when we fight with them , the air's gonna be full of gunsmoke .
i saw it all , mother , every bit .
it's no place for you , joey .
no place for you either , marian .
i was scared .
then pa picked up that man and slung him on the floor .
i didn't do much .
it was all shane .
how are you feeling?
better .
you did , joe .
it was ugly and you were both wonderful .
when that chair came down on you , shane , i thought you were a goner .
it was an easy chair , joey .
i bet you two could lick anyone .
well , one thing's for sure , ryker's gonna think twice .
don't talk about ryker any more now .
i wish we could forget him .
this turpentine'll hurt .
he wouldn't say nothing .
no matter how much it hurt .
would you , shane?
i'm afraid i would , joey , if it hurt bad enough .
it stings like anything .
joey , go on to bed .
it does smart , i know .
ouch !
gosh !
joey , for the last time , go to bed .
yeah , me , too .
come on , son .
will you kiss me goodnight , mother?
all right .
your head ...
your head needs a bandage .
it's good enough , marian , it's fine .
thanks very much .
you wanna know something , mother?
what is it?
what is it , joey?
mother ...
i just love shane .
do you?
i love him almost as much as i love pa .
that's all right , isn't it?
he's a fine man .
he's so good .
don't you like him , mother?
yes , i like him , too , joey .
goodnight , joey .
what's the matter , honey?
joe ...
hold me .
don't say anything .
just hold me tight .
'night , ma !
goodnight , joey .
'night , pa !
'night , son .
'night , shane !
where's ryker?
he's getting a little sleep .
he sent for me .
sit down for a minute .
we're having a celebration today .
where's the coffee?
i'll put it right on .
what's going on here?
plenty .
going somewhere?
looks that way , don't it?
don't let 'em bluff you , ernie .
bluff , huh?
see that?
they killed my sow last night .
kept shooting and yelling what they'd do next .
woke up the kids and scared the missus half to death .
we're gonna put a stop to that .
i said i'd stay for one more hand .
well , this is it .
i had enough of ryker .
here they come again !
right through my ploughed ground .
what do you think of that , stonewall torrey?
starrett and the rest of us are gonna take the juice out of 'em , one of these days .
anyhow , i'm going to grafton's to get a bottle .
show 'em it's independence day .
ma , you getting ready?
good luck .
good luck for you , too , stonewall .
can't see a pig in sight !
i don't see none , but i sure can smell 'em .
they cut mr wright's fence and mr shipstead's , too .
they did?
shane , what would you do if you caught them cutting our fence?
i'd ask them to please go around by the gate .
oh , shane !
come on , i'll race you to the barn .
it's a go !
why don't you ever wear your six shooter , shane?
i guess i don't see as many bad men as you do .
shane .
you want me to tell you something?
if you want to .
i saw your gun in there , one day .
i took a look at it .
oh?
are you mad?
no , i guess not .
but if i were you , i'd leave a thing like this alone .
i wrapped it up in the blanket again .
that's a good boy .
could i see it again?
you promised you'd show me how to shoot .
please !
all right , joey .
come on .
get 'em up !
we've got some learning to do !
come on .
you stand right here .
all right , put your arms down to your side .
your holster's too low .
never have your holster at arm's length .
let's fix this .
you always have it here , with the grip between the elbow and the wrist .
so when your hand comes up , the gun clears the holster without coming up too high , see?
now you try it , real fast and straight .
that's it .
gosh !
is that what real gunfighters do?
no , joey .
most of them have tricks of their own .
one , for instance , likes a shoulder holster .
another one puts it in the belt of his pants .
and some like two guns .
but one's all you need if you can use it ... ... after 15 paces .
no good for putting a bullet where you want it .
which is the best way?
what i'm telling you is as good as any , better than most .
let me see you shoot .
what do you want me to shoot at?
the little white rock over there , see?
gosh , almighty , that is good !
you see , joey?
now look .
remember .
when your hand comes up , you still clear your holster .
shane .
hello , mrs starrett .
i was teaching joey a little shooting .
i don't want ...
you ought to see shane shoot .
he's teaching me .
yes , i know .
get ready for the party .
oh , ma !
guns aren't going to be my boy's life .
why do you always have to spoil everything?
a gun is a tool , no better or worse than any other tool , an axe , a shovel , or anything .
a gun is as good or as bad as the man using it .
remember that .
we'd all be better off if there wasn't a single gun in this valley , including yours .
what's all the shooting about?
you're starting the celebrating a little early , aren't you?
well , look at that woman , in her wedding dress !
shane , you better hitch up that team ,
'cause today we're really gonna celebrate the fourth of july !
i'm supposed to say to the squatters , " i'm busted but you're welcome .
it ain't that bad .
that's easy for you to say .
i've been your friend a long time , i'm reasonable .
but something's got to give .
out here a man can go just so far .
i've gone along with the new law .
i've stayed away from gunfighting .
sure , i've tried to buffalo the sodbusters .
you got to admit , my men have kept their six guns cased .
and now?
i can guess what's on your mind .
keep your guesses to yourself .
i like joe starrett .
fool oughta listen to reason .
your reason?
what's the matter with you?
no offence , rufe .
it's your own conscience eating on you .
conscience !
hello , torrey .
something i can do you for?
a jug .
it's the fourth .
come in , come in .
jug .
and a whiskey .
here's to you , ryker , for running ernie wright off his claim .
another .
is that one of them?
yeah .
it's a downright dirty shame .
it's all he had and he worked hard for it .
i want to tell you something , ryker .
he's running because he's a coward .
and here's to me , 'cause i ain't a coward and you ain't getting my claim .
they're hot headed .
you'd get him to draw without any trouble .
it'd be easy .
you can't scare me any more than you can joe starrett .
no .
it's starrett we want .
three cheers for wyoming !
the rest of you care to join me?
drink a toast to the greatest state in the union?
i'm from wyoming .
here's to the independence of the sovereign state of alabama .
there you are .
i'm through with all you yanks .
listen , you yankees ... !
hello , axel .
you're late , reb , we took richmond two hours ago !
everybody , come here ...
marian !
you come too , i have something important to tell you .
axel ...
ja , mama .
now ...
you all know what today is .
it's independence day .
except for one man here .
yes , sir .
this was the day joe starrett got himself hooked , by golly !
well , no ...
what i'd like to say is ...
well , say it , joe !
i'd like to say that axel's right .
what did he say , joe?
i gave up my independence 10 years ago today .
but no man ever gave it up as easy as i did .
and what's more , i wouldn't trade places with any man in this world .
good speech !
go on , joe , give her a kiss .
come here !
congratulations .
pass the word to the boys , i got some cheer for us .
many more , joe !
we were ready to give you up , you and ernie .
ernie's getting out today .
packed up kit and caboodle .
been expecting that .
ryker's boys bluffed him out .
maybe he had sense .
what were you doing in town?
joe , i want to dance .
marian , they've fenced me out here .
joe don't want you in town by yourself .
it's just ryker and grafton gabbing .
grafton's ok .
another man was there , likely hired by ryker .
who was that?
stranger , decked out like a gunfighter .
did you say " guns "?
yeah , two guns .
what did he look like?
packs two guns , kinda lean ...
he wears a black hat .
is he a friend of yours?
no .
a man named wilson looks like that , a gunfighter .
jack wilson?
gunfighter outta cheyenne .
can't be him , can it?
i didn't ask him his name .
what about him?
what's a gunman doing around here?
pow wow with ryker?
don't start .
we don't know it's wilson .
this wilson , would you know him , shane?
if you saw him?
maybe .
if it is wilson , he's fast on the draw , so be careful .
you seem to know a lot about this kind of business , shane .
that is enough .
come and eat before things get cold .
i don't want no part of gunslinging .
murder's a better name .
we eat now , everyone .
you fellas get the shoe game !
torrey , i want to go to the blacksmith's , but joe says we shouldn't go alone .
any time you wanna go to town , i'll ride along with you .
i'm a soldier who's done fighting in real battles .
i can shoot just as straight ...
shane ...
yes , joey?
think that was him?
who?
that man torrey seen in town .
do you think that was wilson?
don't worry about things like that .
rest , joey .
it's past your bedtime .
yes , mother .
no , joey .
i'll open it .
all right .
all right .
i'll open the gate for you .
who goes there?
brother rufe's come to pay you a little visit .
howdy , starrett .
evening , ma'am .
i had somethin 'i wanted to talk over with you .
whatever business we got , we can talk over right here .
i'll just lay it on the barrelhead , then .
how'd you like to work for me?
i work for myself .
done enough working for others .
wait till i tell you .
i'll pay you top wages .
more than you make on this patch of ground .
no , i'm not interested .
i haven't said it all .
you can run your cattle with mine .
what's more , i'll buy your homestead .
set a price you think is reasonable , you'll find me reasonable .
is that fair?
you've made things hard for us , and we're in the right .
right?
you in the right?
when i came to this country , you weren't much older than your boy .
we had rough times .
me and other men that are mostly dead now .
i got a bad shoulder yet from a cheyenne arrowhead .
we made this country , we found it and we made it , with blood and empty bellies .
cattle we brought in were hazed off by indians and rustlers .
they don't bother you much any more because we handled 'em .
we made a safe range out of this .
some of us died doing it , but we made it .
then people move in who never had to raw hide it through the old days .
they fence off my range and fence me off from water .
some of them plough ditches , take out irrigation water .
so the creek runs dry sometimes and i gotta move my stock because of it .
and you say we have no right to the range .
the men that did the work and ran the risks have no rights?
i take you for a fair man , starrett .
i'm not belittling what you did , but you didn't find this country .
there were trappers here and indian traders before you .
they tamed this country .
they weren't ranchers .
rights !
you think you've the right to say nobody else has got any .
that ain't the way the government looks at it .
i didn't come to argue .
i made you a fair proposition .
what about the others?
shane knows he can work for me .
the other homesteaders?
look , be reasonable !
after all , there's just so many hands in a deck of cards .
then , i've got to say no .
you don't give a man much choice .
how do you feel about it , son?
would you like to go partners with me?
i don't want trouble with your father .
we don't want anyone to get hurt .
joey ain't quite of age , ryker .
how about it , son?
come here , joey .
i don't want you to be sorry , starrett .
i'll see you .
what do you make of him?
he's no cow puncher .
no .
he doesn't look the part .
i like starrett , too , but i'll kill him if i have to .
i'll kill him if i have to .
you mean i'll kill him if you have to .
i can't have any run in with the law .
you heard grafton .
just get starrett in here .
it wouldn't take much to bait him .
well , look here .
look here .
why don't we just gun him and get on with it?
one's run already .
it won't take much to stampede the rest .
remember , wilson , you got to make this look right to grafton .
hey , come here !
torrey ...
i wouldn't go over there , torrey .
nobody's gonna buffalo me .
what can i do for you?
where do you think you're going?
to get a whiskey .
torrey .
torrey .
torrey .
they tell me they call you " stonewall " .
anything wrong with that?
it's just funny .
i guess they named a lot of that ... ... southern trash after old stonewall .
who'd they name you after?
or would you know?
i'm saying that " stonewall " jackson was trash himself .
him and lee , and all the rest of them rebs .
you , too .
you're a low down , lying yankee .
prove it .
no , torrey !
one less sodbuster .
what?
he tried to pull on wilson .
ain't that right , swede?
he tried to reach for a ...
all right .
get him outta here .
tell your friends we'll be waiting for any more that come in looking for trouble .
you understand that , swede?
now get him outta here .
what happened?
the sodbuster tried to kill wilson .
what's the shooting?
sodbuster tried to pull on wilson .
lewis !
lewis !
pa !
what's happened?
lewis !
fred !
fred !
torrey , he is dead !
ryker did it !
i'll go get starrett .
shane , we sure enough earned our keep today .
if they just leave us alone , we'll make a farm out of this yet .
somebody's coming , pa .
looks like shipstead .
it's mr shipstead .
starrett !
torrey , he is dead !
torrey?
torrey , he is dead !
the new man shot him , the new man that works for ryker did it .
i was across the street , i heard anger in the voices .
the two of them reach for pistols , but the new man is quick , terribly quick .
one shot , torrey dead .
one shot .
what happened?
we go to town together .
he say it be safe .
it was all quiet .
we separate .
then the anger in the voices , i hear .
only the anger , not the words .
ryker's men were all around .
what started it?
i passed lewis , his missus and johnson .
they're scared .
who saw it?
just the ryker men and me .
morgan say they wait for any more who come looking for trouble .
marian , you get ready .
mrs torrey will need you .
shane , hitch up the team .
what are you going to do , joe?
go to town .
i'm gonna see about this .
you can't go alone .
marian , i'm going .
she's right , joe .
but the others are all in this , it's not just you .
wait for them .
sooner or later , someone's got to go .
but not now .
don't you go alone !
the other homesteaders , i think they run .
i think they get out of here .
here comes joe starrett .
wish he'd tend to his own business .
what goes on?
we're going on .
i've had enough .
i sure figured you for a better man .
you saw what's happened .
torrey's dead .
just gonna pile up your plunder and skip .
too scared to see torrey get a decent funeral .
i don't want him killed .
we're going .
it ain't a question of who stays or who runs .
we gotta see stonewall get a christian burial , and his wife hear some words of comfort said over her man .
we'll make sure it's done .
torrey's already dead .
i don't want it to happen to my man .
fred , if you ain't at that funeral , i'll sure take it bad of you .
well ... cemetery hill's on the way out , martha ...
shipstead , would you please lead us in the lord's prayer?
our father who art in heaven , hallowed be thy name .
thy kingdom come , thy will be done on earth , as it is in heaven .
give us this day our daily bread , and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us .
and lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil .
for thine is the kingdom , and the power , and the glory , for ever .
amen .
he's gonna bite you !
goodbye , mrs starrett , we're going .
goodbye , joe .
goodbye , axel .
goodbye , john .
sue , you put the kids in the wagon .
wait for me , lewis .
i'm coming with you .
wait a minute , let's not be in a hurry .
there's one more thing .
torrey was a pretty brave man .
we'd be doing wrong if we wasn't the same .
last time you argued that , torrey was alive .
you want us to stay for more of this?
we can have a regular settlement .
we can have a town , and churches and a school ...
graveyards ...
you've just got to , that's all .
he wants you to stay for something that means more than anything .
your families .
your wives and kids .
like you , lewis , your girls ... ... and shipstead with his boys .
they've got a right to stay here and grow up and be happy .
it's up to you people to have nerve enough to not give it up .
that's right .
we can't give up this valley and we ain't gonna do it .
this is farming country , a place for people to bring up their families .
who's ryker to run us away from our own homes?
he only wants to grow beef , and we want to grow families , to grow them good and strong , the way they were meant to be grown .
god didn't make all this country just for one man like ryker .
he's got it though , and that's what counts .
look , look there .
a fire !
it's lewis's place .
it's our place .
ryker lit it .
he had no right .
he wouldn't have , if you hadn't left it .
i built it with my own hands .
not the girls 'room .
i was getting round to it .
if we stick together , we can put that place back up .
can't we?
right .
we'll help you build the room , johnson and joe .
shane'll help .
yeah .
we'll get the timber and put it right back up , right?
yes , sir !
we'll do it .
me , too , i'll help .
you'll do that for us?
all that , just for us?
not just for you , martha , for all of us in this valley .
come and help .
maybe we can save part of that .
that's the spirit .
let's get to the lewises 'place .
come on , men !
boss !
looks like lewis is going back .
starrett's holding 'em together .
he could set fire to mine .
stay on your ground .
he'll do us like he did torrey .
there's a law against killing .
the law is three days 'ride from here .
you know that .
what does that leave us with?
give me time .
who's gonna fight ryker?
he knows he's got us on the run .
you men hang on ...
hang on?
i promise something's gonna be done .
but what , joe?
leave that to me .
i'll have it out with ryker .
you're taking on too much .
if i have to kill him .
that's wrong .
don't even think that .
starrett's got to go .
i've warned him twice , but he's pig headed .
he'll have to pay for it .
joe , you can't do it !
if the lewises have the courage to start over , i won't let them down .
but you can't go in town to kill ryker .
he'll kill you .
tell him i'm a reasonable man , things have gone far enough .
tell him i'm beat , anything , but , by jupiter , get him here !
he'll come .
he thinks he's a reasonable man .
hello , calloway .
he'll kill you .
it's a chance i gotta take .
this is a false square knot , joey , it won't hold .
shane !
tell him he can't go .
tell him it won't work .
tell him !
shane !
wait , joe , till things cool off .
wait that long , anyway .
that's right , isn't it , shane?
i can't tell joe what's right , marian .
please wait , joe .
won't you do even this for me?
starrett?
mr starrett !
who is it?
peace party , from ryker .
one of you can come across and talk .
stay out of that garden .
we ain't armed .
brother rufe wants to see you .
he says to tell you he's a reasonable man .
he's responsible for torrey's killing .
my brother wouldn't kill anybody .
he don't wanna go to jail .
torrey was a hot head , he picked on a stranger .
torrey didn't wanna be reasonable .
you wanna be reasonable , don't you?
i always figured on being reasonable .
my brother's waiting .
he'll see you at grafton's .
who else?
not us .
we're heading home .
i'll see your brother .
shane !
shane .
who is it?
calloway .
chris calloway .
stay where you are .
i can drill you .
hold it , i got something to tell you .
what do you want?
starrett's up against a stacked deck .
bang !
bang !
bang !
bang !
why are you telling me?
i reckon something's come over me .
i don't figure .
i'm quitting ryker .
so long .
chris ...
thanks .
be seeing you .
no use to argue , marian .
i'm going into this with my eyes open .
no !
isn't there anything i can say to change things?
maybe this is a chance .
morgan and them boys went home ...
you don't really believe that , that's not the reason .
it's just too much for me to give up , this place and our valley ...
all the things that will be .
will be !
bang !
bang , bang , bang !
joey , don't point that thing !
go play outside .
play outside , joey !
please , dear .
go outside and play .
it's just pride , that's all , a silly kind of a pride .
don't i mean anything to you , joe?
doesn't joey?
marian ...
honey , it's because you mean so much to me that i've got to go .
could i go on living with you , and you thinking i'd showed yellow?
and what about joey?
how would i explain that to him?
oh , joe ...
joe !
i've been thinking a lot , and ... ... i know i'm kinda slow sometimes , but i see things ...
and i know if anything happened to me that you'd be took care of .
you'd be took care of , better than i could do it myself .
i never thought i'd live to hear myself say that , but ...
i guess now's a pretty good time to lay things bare .
you talk as though i'd be glad for you to go .
honey , you're the most honest and the finest girl that ever lived .
i couldn't do what i gotta do if i hadn't always known i could trust you .
now , don't you go counting me out !
i wouldn't have lived this long if i wasn't pretty tough .
pa !
shane's got his gun on .
he's coming !
gun?
what's the idea?
don't let him go .
don't anybody go !
this is my kind of game .
but it ain't yours .
maybe you're a match for ryker , maybe not , but you're no match for wilson .
then , i'll outlast him .
but i do appreciate it , shane .
you're both out of your senses .
this isn't worth a life .
are you fighting for this shack , this ground and nothing but work?
i'm sick of it , i'm sick of trouble .
let's move , let's go on , please !
marian , don't say that !
you love this place more than me .
not any more .
even if it's true , it changes nothing .
there must be some way , shane?
some way?
it's no use , joe .
no use?
what's stopping me?
i am .
get out of my way .
am i gonna have to fight you , too?
that depends on you .
stop !
stop !
shane !
you hit him with your gun !
i hate you !
walk him around when he comes to .
joey , bring water and a towel .
here , marian .
hide this .
he'll be all right .
no one can blame him for not keeping that date .
shane ...
wait !
you were through with gunfighting .
i changed my mind .
are you doing this just for me?
for you , marian ... ... and joe and little joe .
then we'll never see you again?
never's a long time , marian .
tell him ...
tell him i was sorry .
no need to tell him that .
please , shane ...
mother ...
please ...
take care of yourself .
mother !
pa's coming along all right .
yes , joey .
why did shane ...?
shane did what he had to do .
you don't hate shane .
i know , mother .
shane ... !
i'm sorry !
he didn't hear you .
shane !
shane !
i'm sorry !
i came to get your offer , ryker .
i'm not dealing with you .
where's starrett?
you're dealing with me , ryker .
i got no quarrel with you , shane .
you can walk out now and no hard feeling .
what's your offer , ryker?
to you , not a thing .
that's too bad .
too bad .
you've lived too long .
your kind of days are over .
my days?
and yours , gunfighter?
the difference is i know it .
so we'll turn in our six guns to the bartender , and we'll all start hoeing spuds , is that it?
not quite yet .
we haven't heard from your friend here .
i wouldn't push too far if i were you .
our fight ain't with you .
it ain't with me , wilson?
no , it ain't , shane .
i wouldn't pull on wilson , shane .
will , you're a witness to this .
so you're jack wilson .
what's that mean to you , shane?
i've heard about you .
what have you heard , shane?
i've heard that you're a low down , yankee liar .
prove it !
shane , look out !
shane !
i knew you could , shane .
i knew it just as well as anything .
was that him?
was that wilson?
that was him .
that was wilson , all right .
he was fast , fast on the draw .
joey , what are you doing here?
i'm sorry , shane .
you don't have to be .
you'd better run back .
can't i ride home behind you?
i'm afraid not , joey .
please !
why not?
i gotta be going on .
why , shane?
a man has to be what he is , joey .
can't break the mould .
i tried it and it didn't work for me .
we want you , shane .
joey , there's no living with a killing .
there's no going back from one .
right or wrong , it's a brand .
a brand sticks .
there's no going back .
now you run on home to your mother , and tell her ... ... tell her everything's all right and there aren't any more guns in the valley .
shane ...
it's bloody !
you're hurt !
i'm all right , joey .
go home to your mother and father and grow up to be strong and straight .
and , joey ...
take care of them , both of them .
yes , shane .
he'd never have shot you if you'd seen him !
bye , little joe .
he'd never even have cleared the holster , would he , shane?
pa's got things for you to do !
and mother wants you !
i know she does !
shane !
shane !
come back !
