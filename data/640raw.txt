this is definitely not been my day .
you know what i'm saying , buddy?
what a mess .
hey , you rhinos have really tiny brains , do you know that?
it's just a fact .
you probably don't know what i'm talking about .
a dandelion .
must be the last one of season .
carl .
easy , frank .
he ruined our salad .
oh , my mistake .
it's my mistake .
let me ...
no , seriously , let me take care of this .
oh .

my goodness , they're my favourite .
hmm , delicious .

we just take our free piata and go , if you don't mind .
buddy , if not them today , it's just someone else tomorrow .
i rather it not be today .
okay?
look we're gonna break your neck so you don't feel a thing .
how's that?
wait a minute .
i thought rhinos are vegetarians .
an excellent point .
shut up !
who says we gonna eat him after we kill him?
come on , move it .
you know , i don't like animals who kill for pleasure .
save it , for a mammal that cares .
i'm a mammal that cares .
okay , look .
if either of you make it across that sink hole in front of you , you get the sloth .
that's right , you losers .
you take a step and you're dead .
you're bluffing , huh?
yeah , that was a bluff .
go !
a dandelion?
we did it !
what?
you have beautiful eyes .
get off my face .
you and me , we make a great team .
what do you say we just head south together?
yeah , jump on my back and relax the whole way .
really?
no .
wait , aren't you going south?
the changing season , migration instincts?
any of this ringing a bell?
i guess not , bye .
okay , thanks for the help .
i can take it from here .
hey , you over grown weasel .
wait till we get down there .
the whole south thing is way over rated .
the heat , the crowd .
this great .
you and me , two bachelors knocking about in the wild .
no , you just want a bodyguard so you don't become somebody's side dish .
you're very strut mammoth .
can you lead the way , mr. big guy?
manfred .
how about manny the moody mammoth or nanny the ...
stop following me .
okay , so you got it .
you won't even know i'm here .
i'll just zip the lip when i say ...
look at the cute little baby , diego .
isn't it nice if he's joining us for breakfast?
it wouldn't be breakfast without him .
his daddy wiped out half our pack .
and rag our skin to keep warm .
an eye for an eye .
don't you think?
let show that human what happen when he messed with sabers .
alert the troops .
we attack at dawn .
and diego , bring me that baby .
alive .
if i'm gonna enjoy my revenge , i want it to be fresh .
i'm wiped out .
that's your shelter?
you're a big guy .
you got a lot of wood .
i'm a little guy .
you only got half a stick .
yeah , but with my little stick , and my highly evolved brain ...
i'll shall create fire .
fascinating .
we'll see if brains triumph over brawn tonight .
now won't we?
hey , i think i saw a spark .
any chance i can squeeze in there with you?
isn't there someone else you can annoy?
friends?
family?
poison reptiles?
my family abandoned me .
they just kind of migrated without me .
you should see what they did last year .
they woke up early and they tied my hands and feet together .
they buried the cave door , and covered their tracks .
who needs them anyway .
so what about you?
you have family?
okay , you're tired , i see .
we'll talk more in the morning .
manfred?
manfred .
could you move over?
come on , nobody fall asleep that fast .
manny !
that's diego , fall back !
where's the baby?
i lost it over the falls .
you lost it?
i want that baby , diego .
i'll get it .
you better .
unless you want to serve yourself as the replacement .
we'll go up to half peak .
meet us there .
it'd better be alive .
can we trust you with that , diego?
let's go !
and you pick this year off my shoulders .
if you gonna have a mating partner , at least pick a female with the same color palette , right?
and i thought , wow , he's gonna go primal , you know what i'm saying?
if you find a mate in life , you should be loyal .
in your case , it's grateful .
get away from me .
well , i think mate in life is stupid .
i mean there's plenty of sid to go around ...
manny?
look at that .
he's okay .
she's gone .
hey , manny , are you forgetting something?
no .
but you just saved him .
yeah , but i'm still trying to get rid of the last thing i saved .
you can't leave him here .
look , there's smoke .
that's his herd right up the hill .
we should return him .
let's get something straight .
there's no " we " .
there never was a " we " .
in fact , without me , there wouldn't even be a " you " !
just up the hill .
listen very carefully .
i'm not g o i n g .
fine .
be a jerk .
i'll take care of him .
go .
yeah , that's good .
you take care of him?
you can't even take care of yourself .
this i gotta see .
i'll return you .
we don't need that manny .
you know we don't .
you're an embarrassment the nature , do you know that?
i'm fine .
i'm fine !
i'm gonna die .
that thing is mine .
no , actually that thing belongs to us .
us?
you two are an odd couple .
there is no " us " .
i see .
you can't have one of your own so you want to adopt .
look , i'm sorry to interrupt this .
but we gotta go .
the baby , please .
i'm returning to his herd .
oh , yeah .
nice try , bucktooth .
you're calling me a liar?
i didn't say that .
you were thinking it .
i don't like this cat .
he reads mind .
name is diego , friend .
manfred .
and i'm not your friend .
fine , manfred .
if you're looking for the humans , you're wasting your time . they left this morning .
thanks for the advice .
now beat it .
all right , i'll help you bring it to its herd .
but promise me that you'd leave me alone after that .
okay , deal .
what's your problem?
you're my problem .
but i think you're stressed .
that's why you eat so much .
it's hard to get fat on a diet .
i'm not fat .
it's all this fur .
it makes me look puffy .
all right , yeah .
fat hair .
but when you're ready to talk , i'm here .
just drop it on the ledge .
shouldn't we make sure they found him?
good idea .
no , no , no !
wait .
don't spear me !
this is a problem .
now what?
that's perfect .
i told you they were gone .
look who it is .
don't you have some poor defenseless animals to disembowel?
they couldn't be far .
they went this way?
or this way?
you don't know much about tracking , do you?
i'm a sloth .
i see a tree , eat a leave , that's my tracking .
you didn't miss them by much .
it's still green .
they head north 2 hours ago .
still green .
they head north 2 hours ago .
you don't need this aggravation .
give me the baby .
i can track humans down faster than you can .
and you're just a good citizen helping out , right?
i just know where the humans will go .
glacier pass .
everybody knows they have a settlement on the other side .
unless you know how to track , you never gonna reach them before their pass closed up with snow .
which should be like , tomorrow .
so you can give that baby to me or go get lost in the blizzard .
it's your choice .
here's your little bundle of joy .
we'll return it to the human .
big bad tiggy wiggy gets left behind .
poor tiggy wiggy ...
sid , tiggy wiggy is gonna lead the way .
manny , can i talk to you for a second?
no .
the sooner we find the humans , the sooner i get rid of mr. stinky drew face .
and the baby too .
you won't always have jumbo around to protect you .
and when that day comes , i suggest you watch your back .
cause i'll be chewing on it .
human tracker , up front where i can see you .
help me .
you gotta make it stop .
i can't take it anymore !
i've eaten things that didn't complain as much .
stop shouting at me .
you're holding it wrong .
watch its head !
just put it down .
its nose is dry .
that means something is wrong with it .
maybe we should lick it .
just in case .
i'll do it .
you know , its wearing one of those baby thingies .
so if it poops , where does it go?
humans are disgusting .
okay , you .
check for poop .
why am i the poop checker?
because returning it was your idea .
because you're small and insignificant
and because i'll pound you if you don't .
what else?
now , sid !
i mean , my goodness .
all right , look out .
coming through .
watch out !
stop waving it around !
oh , i'm gonna slip !
it's clean !
got you !
would you cut it out !
hey , do that again .
he likes it .
that makes me feel better too .
turn him towards me .
where is the baby?
there it is !
where is the baby?
there it is !
stop it !
you're scaring it !
i bet he's hungry .
how about some milk?
i'd love some .
not you , the baby .
i ain't exactly doing it right now , pal .
you are a bit low on the food chain to be mouthing off , aren't you?
enough !
food !
prepare for ice age !
protect the dodo way of life !
survival separates the dodo from the beasts !
protect the dodo way of life !
prepare for ice age !
ice age?
i've heard of these crack pots .
intruders !
don't fall in .
if you do , you'll definately ...
intruders !
burn and die .
hey , can we have our melon back?
junior is hungry and ...
no way !
this is our private stock pile for ice age .
sub artic temperatures will force us underground for billions billions years .
so you got three melons?
if you weren't smart enough to plan ahead , then doom on you .
get away from me .
no !
retrieve the melon !
attack !
the melon !
there goes our last female .
the last melon !
ahhh , sid .
now we gotta find more food .
look at that .
dinner and a show .
now to find a meal be fitting a conquering hero .
with who?
a foe?
come on , you wanna a piece of me?
bedtime .
the triumphant returns .
so full .
how about a good night kiss for you?
shh .
it's asleep .
i was talking to you .
fine , i'll tuck myself in .
good night .
would you stop that !
all right .
all right .
trying to relax .
all right .
what the ...
go ahead .
slice me .
it'll be the last thing you'd ever do .
i'm working here , you wasted fur .
fustrated , diego?
tracking down helpless infants too difficult for you?
what are you two doing here?
soto's getting tired of waiting .
yeah .
he said , come back with the baby , or don't come back at all !
i have a message for soto .
tell him , i'm bringing the baby .
and tell him , i'm bringing a mammoth .
a mammoth .
mammoth never travels alone .
this one does .
and i'm leading him to half peak .

sabers were closing in on it .
so i just snatch it .
so brave .
well , he needed me and i only wish i have one of my own .

i find it attactive in a male .
who wouldn't want a family , i always say .

tell me about it .
all the sensitive ones get eaten .
no , please .
i beg you , i need him .
why?
a good looking guy like you?
you say that but you don't mean it .
no , seriously , look at you .
those ladies , they don't stand a chance .

long teeth?
great news .
i found a short cut .
what do you mean short cut?
i mean it's faster that the long way around .
i know what a short cut is .
either we slip through there and beat the humans to the glacier pass .
or take the long way and miss them .
what do you take me for?
this time tommorow you can be a free mammoth .
hey guys check this out .
the tiger found a shortcut .
no thanks i chose life .
then i suggest you take the shortcut .
are you threatening me?
move sloth !
stick together it's easy to get lost in here .
fish .
i don't want to keep track of one baby .
i got you .
tell the kid to be more careful .
tigers .
it's ok .
tigers are just playing with the antilopes .
with their teeth .
come on sid .
somebody pinch me .
look !
this fat one looks just like you .
look he is playing with his kid .
see that's your problem .
that's what mammoths are supposed to do .
find a she moth , have little baby mammoths ...
sid .
what?
shut up .
look at that .
next stop .
glacier pass .
how could i ever doubted you?
did you hear that?
you are almost home .
my feet are sweating .

i wonder if you're moving .
i wish i'd jump like that .
come on move faster .
manny are you ok?
come on say something .
anything .
what?
i can't hear you .
you are standing on my trunk .

you'd have died trying , to save me .
that's what you do in a herd .
we lookout for each other .
well ... thanks .
i don't about you guys .
we're the weirdest herd i'd ever seen .
i can't wait to get my claws on that mammoth .
no one touches the mammoth until i get that baby .
knock it off i am starving .
i told you to knock it off .
save your energy .
mammoths don't go down easy .
there is only one way to do it .
first you have to force it into a corner .
cut off its retreat .
then go for throat .
we gotta get this kid out of the wind .
how much further?
3 miles .
what're you doing?
i'm painting sloths on a map .

i'll carry you .
come on .
what do you say?
come on everything's gonna be ok .
