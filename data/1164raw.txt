before i start signing these ,
i need to thank somebody who's here tonight .
when i had her at state that didn't sound right .
i never had her .
i wanted her , but never had her .
what i meant was when i took her class .
i had the worst case of writer's block in the world .
all i had were terrible ideas .
i hated them all .
i was just about to drop the class when she said something to me that changed everything .
she said , " terrible ideas are like playground scapegoats .
given the right encouragement , they grow up to be geniuses .
she told me to take one , and work on it .
well , i did .
frances mayes , who loves terrible ideas , may i please french kiss you now?
go for it , willie boy !
married , william .
sorry .
proud of me?
ridiculously .
frances , these are amazing .
what did you do?
chocolate is timing , my friend .
the rest is magic .
hey , professor .
where is the wine?
over there .
tom is one lucky bastard .
a literary wife who makes brownies .
i swear , if you tell me you cook in the nude ,
i'll go home and kill myself .
never in the nude .
always in a thong .
actually , if you knew frances , you'd know these are avoidance .
thanks .
how's the novel going?
not so well .
but the procrastination is coming along fabulously .
soon it will breed abject self loathing , and then i'll just become a writing machine .
what about tom?
how's his book going?
fine .
he's home writing right now .
you know tom?
i met him recently , sort of by coincidence .
the other coincidence is that you reviewed a book of mine .
i did?
did i like it?
you didn't .
well , i'm sorry .
i'm sure there were a lot of other critics who loved it .
and i really hope you didn't take it personally .
you called my lead character " unrealistic .
i think bad reviews should just be forgotten .
give him a brownie .
i would like to give you this .
it comes in peace .
you said you just couldn't get interested in a novel where the protagonist was a guy who spent all of his time living out his horny teenage fantasies .
i just find that ironic .
ironic .
why?
ask your husband .
what did he just say?
frances?
frances?
i've got some unfortunate news for you .
i just got off the phone with your husband's attorney , and they're going to pursue alimony .
how can we be talking about alimony when i hardly make enough money?
but you supported him during the marriage .
yes .
but while he was researching and writing his book ,
i worked while he pretended to be ...
unfortunately , this is just about the math .
he was having an affair .
california's a no fault state .
his attorney indicated your husband would prefer an alimony buy out .
since you two were living rather modestly ,
i don't think the number should be too bad .
they're probably talking about something like $200, 000 .
i don't have that money .
unfortunately , you do .
the house?
its value went through the roof since you bought it .
and renovated it with my mother's money .
well , it's all community property now .
so he gets half the house and alimony .
there's leeway , and we'll make all the arguments we can .
but there is a bargaining chip .
he wants the house .
he wants to keep living there?
yeah .
and if you let him have it , you could end up with a lot of money in your pocket .
i understand he wants it pretty badly .
i'm sorry .
this is so surreal .
how would he even find the money to buy me out of my half?
oh .
oh .
wow .
apparently , she likes the place .
it's near the right schools .
schools?
she's ...
you're gonna get over this .
you will , frances .
someday , you're gonna be happy again .
right .
and the desk?
the desk goes .
no , the desk can stay .
the couch?
yes , please .
wait a minute .
no , the sofas can stay .
how about the chairs?
they stay , too .
actually , everything's going to stay except those boxes .
those boxes with the books in them .
if you don't mind .
you're sure?
yeah .
the bedroom?
nope .
kitchen?
no .
so then we're done .
we're done .
you getting a divorce?
it shows?
these are furnished , short term apartments .
that's who we get .
your neighbor in 2 b.
he's an attorney .
his divorce has been dragging on for three years .
nice guy .
gives free legal advice to the other tenants .
if his crying gets on your nerves , just bang on the wall .
he'll stop .
sorry .
guy above you is a doctor .
he hands out the sleeping pills .
what do you do?
i'm a writer .
so you can help the others with their suicide notes .
wow .
you're one of those funny landlords .
not really .
well , here's your keys .
have a good stay .
thanks .
home .
ta da !
you start a marriage with cake and champagne .
finish it that way , too .
the beginning and the end should be fun , fun , fun .
too bad about those years in the middle .
sorry .
make a wish .
things got crazy at the hospital .
hi .
you made it in time for the toast .
bravo .
and it only took a year .
to freedom .
to freedom .
thanks .
you're not drinking .
you're not drinking .
fifth time was a charm .
oh , my god !
patti !
when are you due?
may .
may !
oh , my god !
i'm going to be an auntie !
i'm going to be an auntie .
yes .
it changes our plans a bit .
well , of course .
we were about to take a 10 day tour to romantic tuscany .
but i don't want patti flying .
small sacrifice .
we decided to change our coach tickets into an upgraded ticket for you .
oh .
this is amazing .
really generous .
thank you , but no .
how can you say no to tuscany?
no .
like that .
that's your depression speaking .
it doesn't speak ltalian .
it speaks high school french .
besides , i'm not depressed anymore .
then what are you still doing living with those losers?
those are my people .
that's not a place you live .
guys , come on .
thank you so much .
but there is no way i can go on a romantic tour of tuscany .
i'm not ready to meet anyone .
you won't .
we can assure you .
oh?
it's a gay tour of romantic tuscany .
so it would be very relaxing for you .
you know , mostly couples .
no one would be there to hit on you .
and you could concentrate and listen to your own inner voice .
my inner voice?
my inner voice that would be saying ,
what am i doing on a gay tour of tuscany?
frances , it's ltaly !
italy .
plus , you could use it as a time to start writing .
well , i'm busy .
i have to review all those books .
instead of working on your own book .
wow .
are you being mean or just hormonal?
okay .
don't kill each other until i get back .
can we please just talk about the baby?
i think you're in danger .
of?
of never recovering .
you know when you come across one of those empty shell people?
and you think , " what the hell happened to you?
well , there came a time in each one of those lives where they were at a crossroads .
crossroads .
god , that is so " oprah .
someplace where they had to decide to turn left or right .
this is no time to be a chickenshit , frances .
i'm not being a chickenshit .
i'm not .
okay , promise me you'll think about it .
i'll think about it .
okay .
i got a feeling about you .
are you looking for a place?
yeah , i guess .
you getting a divorce?
what?
we got short term apartments .
but don't worry .
some stay for years .
we got a writer .
we got a doctor .
the doctor could help you straighten out your life .
hey !
sorry .
it's okay .
do you want to come over?
no !
maybe later .
maybe later .
oh !
hello?
patti , when do i leave?
hi , i'm david .
this is your driver , eduardo .
and you are " gay & away " !
and welcome to your first day of a romantic tour of tuscany .
now , i saw most of you getting to know each other on the plane .
but i wanted to make sure you've all met frances .
hey , frances .
now , frances is straight .
oh , poor girl .
and she just survived a terrible divorce .
and according to her friend patti , she needs our support .
so , frances , why don't you stand up , and let everyone say hello?
no .
come on .
hi !
you're the bachelor , frances .
have some fun !
okay , everyone , follow the flower .
good god , i cannot believe it is raining .
okay , everyone , we're here !
yeah !
okay !
oops .
sorry .
you're empty .
you need a little more?
whoo !
you want more wine?
little more vino?
excuse me .
can a black gal get a drink?
yes , she can .
frances , little more?
mm hmm .
you've got to loosen up , honey .
we having a party !
buongiorno , [ speaking ltalian ]
si ,
what?
pretty awesome , isn't it?
yes , i think you could say that .
pretty awesome .
god , how am i gonna get through all of these?
i mean , how do you begin to describe all of this?
if you have a pen , i could write it for you .
are you a good writer?
i used to be .
all right .
well , have a go .
to my mom .
dear mom .
frances ; dear mom ,
it's market day in cortona ,
the piazza is an ongoing party , and everyone is invited ,
cliches converge at this navel of the world ,
you almost want to laugh , but you can't help feeling these italians know more about having fun than we do ,
i eat a hot grape from the market , and the violet sweetness breaks open in my mouth ,
it even smells purple ,
i wish i could stay longer , but the bell reminds me of time ,
ding dang dong , " the bell says , instead of " ding dong ,
i wish you were here , love ...
rodney .
thanks .
it even smells like purple "?
my mom will never believe i wrote this .
keep it .
ding dang dong goes the bell .
i'm sorry .
bramasole .
bramasole .
it's a nice little villa .
rather run down , but redeemable .
are you going to buy it?
no , no , no .
i'm just a tourist here for the day .
so?
well , who wouldn't want to buy a villa in tuscany?
but the way my life's been going that would be a terrible idea .
a terrible idea .
mm hmm .
don't you just love those?
sorry , everybody .
unscheduled stop .
look at the sheep .
oh , my gosh .
stop the bus !
stop the bus !
hello?
hello?
shit .
oh , excuse me .
oh , i'm sorry .
can i help you , signora?
yes , i thought the house was for sale .
oh , no .
the house is for sale .
but , unfortunately , someone's already buying it .
we like it very much , and we'll buy it today .
very good .
one moment please .
excuse me .
they want it .
they agree on the price .
so soon?
then we asked too little .
ask for 20 million lire more , at least .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
i'm afraid that there has been a change in the price .
it is now 20 million lire more expensive .
why?
it didn't get more valuable in five minutes .
the contessa feels she has asked too little since you agreed to buy it .
that logic is absurd .
excuse me?
what is the price?
are you bidding against us?
wait .
we accept the new price .
no , this is a beautiful house .
and whoever wants it has to pay double .
the contessa says that since there is so much interest in the house , the price is now double .
since the last 10 seconds?
normale ,
you greedy americans .
you think you're so entitled .
you ruin everything .
a lot of us feel really badly about that .
we're going .
we'll look in provence .
fascists !
and her?
how much will she pay?
we'll see .
is it really double the price?
i can't pay double the price .
but please tell the contessa that this is what i got for my house recently in dollars .
minus the work on the place .
hammers , buckets .
men .
chocolate .
and a rental car to drive off a cliff when this all turns out to have been a terrible mistake .
that's what i can pay .
signora ,
you've not even seen the house .
oh .
well .
well , i ...
i can't go back to san francisco .
no .
no .
i'm sorry , signora ,
the contessa's family lived here for generations , so understandably it is very difficult for her to sell .
money is not the only issue .
she needs [ speaking ltalian ]
a sign .
i understand .
i believe in signs , too .
well , thank you .
thank you .
oh !
oh .
oh .
please .
what did she say?
in ltaly , what happened to you is a very good sign .
it is?
yes .
and now ... would you like to see the house?
first , we open an account .
then you transfer the money .
here is the legal description .
two oxen , two days .
i'm sorry .
it's old fashioned .
the land is measured by how long it would take two oxen to plow it .
oh .
oh , that makes sense .
just like that?
before the money's been transferred?
it's a house , not a vespa .
what are you going to do , steal it?
besides , signor martini likes you .
okay .
we'll take care of the rest later .
normale ,
normale?
normale ,
normale ,
frances ; i have bought a house in a foreign country ,
a house and the land it takes two oxen two days to plow ,
not having a plow or an ox ,
i'll have to take their word on that ,
buyer's remorse is a very common affliction among new homeowners ,
just because you have a sudden urge to weep , that doesn't mean you've made a mistake ,
everybody knows old houses have their quirks ,
especially 300 year old houses ,
i have inherited 10, 000 empty wine bottles , one grape , every issue of " la nazione " printed in 1958 , and assorted previous tenants ,
ugh !
the trick to overcoming buyer's remorse is to have a plan ,
pick one room and make it yours ,
go slowly through the house ,
be polite , introduce yourself , so it can introduce itself to you ,
you did what?
frances bought a house in tuscany !
and you're gonna live there alone?
well , i'm not there alone .
i'm there with bugs .
how's the belly?
it's growing .
i can't believe you did this .
did you already sign?
yes .
why?
what?
you think i shouldn't have?
are you telling me i made a mistake?
i don't know .
did you?
well , i don't know .
you're the one who made the " empty shell person " speech .
oh , yeah .
that was me .
okay .
wow !
you bought a villa in tuscany !
so , what's the place like?
it needs a little work .
well , who's gonna do it?
i am .
you are?
i never realized you were so handy .
i can do things .
remember , i fixed that drain?
the drain in your kitchen?
no , that was me .
i handed you the rubber thingy .
the plunger?
that was tom .
i can't believe it .
why did you just say his name?
i'm sorry .
i forgot .
i'm sorry .
i can make this work .
you know?
of course i didn't mean i was gonna do all the work myself .
i can hire the descendents of roman gods to do the heavy lifting .
then , just supervise , tell them what to do .
so , have you met him yet?
who?
the guy you're gonna meet .
patti , please .
you know what?
it's starting to rain here a little bit .
so i think i have to go now .
wait , fran .
i want you to kiss the belly for me .
fran .
bye bye .
can you star 69 ltaly?
no .
i'm gonna try .
hello?
okay .
one 1, 000 ,
2 aah !
jesus !
okay .
stop it .
stop it .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
you're gonna be okay .
you're safe here .
just don't fly around , okay?
you'll freak me out .
oh , god .
signora?
signora mayes?
buongiorno ,
i see you have survived the storm .
i'm alive .
but the washing machine is dead .
yes .
it was electrocuted .
i'm happy to see that you were not .
you came to check on me?
you're meeting the contractors today , and i came to help you .
i believe one of them is here .
here?
downstairs .
oh .
oh , yeah .
he's here .
i was hoping to take this wall down and return these two small rooms into one big room .
oh , wonderful .
you should have been an architect .
you have excellent taste .
so , do you think it can be done?
hidden pipes , a week .
the bathrooms , 3 days .
signora , give me the keys of this place , and in one month , i will give you the keys to your palace .
just ...
just leave it to me .
boom !
boom !
boom !
oh .
oh !
he says he fixed it himself many years ago .
really?
oh .
you want to see the rest of the house?
okay .
yes , yes .
he suggest that he rebuild the wall .
it is important for the structure of the garden .
he has a team of experts .
buongiorno ,
hello , miss .
we are not ltalian .
we are from polonia ,
poland .
oh .
do you all speak english?
only me .
and only a little .
i am pawel .
oh , pawel .
nice to meet you .
buongiorno ,
jerzy .
jerzy .
hello .
zbignew .
zbignew .
frances .
what do you think of nino?
i know his mother .
if he does a bad job , he's ...
well , then .
okay .
yes .
okay .
yes .
yes , yes .
okay .
yes .
see , frances?
no problem .
nino !
oh , god !
run !
oh !
aah !
okay .
yes .
kurwa mac !
kurwa mac " means " holy shit " in polish ,
i learned that that day ,
the fact i'm trying to speak polish in italy is just one of the many surprises around here ,
is he a licensed electrician?
no .
he's a licensed literature professor .
oh .
czeslaw milosz .
i like him .
czeslaw milosz .
it is only natural getting to know people should take time ,
every day i watch for the old man with the flowers ,
and i wonder , was he born here?
did he love someone here?
did he lose someone here?
he doesn't seem as curious about me , but that's all right ,
these days , i'm something of a loner myself ,
i'm pretty good at staying entertained ,
mostly , i like to hang out at a bar i know conveniently located in my backyard ,
fortunately , there are things here you can't do alone ,
it's my neighbor placido who's teaching me about olives ,
t oday is okay .
but never pick when it's wet , huh?
okay .
these look good .
oh , my god .
papa !
si?
i'm finished .
good .
gather up the net .
okay .
chiara !
si?
go and see if gianni needs some help .
okay .
go , go .
ciao ,
oops !
everything okay?
si ,
grazie ,
francesca?
are you busy tonight?
no .
then come to dinner .
it's unhealthy to eat alone .
stop it , mom .
it's embarrassing .
ls she okay?
of course .
she's fine .
mama , that's enough .
my granny's very sensitive .
she cries all day .
are we celebrating something in particular?
gratitude to the saints for saving us from droughts , mad dogs , and glandular disorders .
good evening , everybody .
sorry i'm late .
katherine !
hand me your hat .
do you like it?
i suppose it wasn't a terrible idea , buying a villa .
are you up there all alone?
no lord and master , no consort?
no .
do you have one?
one?
ha !
i knew this would happen .
remember?
don't blame me .
i told him not to get her that computer .
she got an e mail lover , you see , from ecuador .
finally , she had to tell him her age .
no mail !
you had it coming .
you're wrong .
i hurt in my heart .
even though i'm old , my heart still aches .
i'm so sorry .
l'amore , si , [ speaks ltalian ]
si ,
hmm?
celibe?
celibe ,
celibate?
celibate !
si ,
no .
i mean ...
well , actually , i have to admit it has been a while .
celibe " in ltalian means " single .
he's not asking when you last had sex .
he's asking whether or not you're married .
thank you .
no , i'm not .
everything all right , darling?
oh , terrific .
i'm just eating .
he is .
oh , my god .
i feel like such an idiot .
don't .
flirting's a ritual in ltaly .
just enjoy it .
taste this .
it's gorgeous .
mmm !
how do you do it?
do what?
this .
well , hats make me happy .
and ice cream .
ice cream changed my fate .
it was because of ice cream that my beloved fefe discovered me .
fefe?
il maestro ,
who?
federico , darling .
fellini?
he discovered me in the piazza novena with my parents eating an ice cream .
i was gobbling it down ,
ietting it run all over my chin because i was hungry .
do you like ice cream? " he asked me .
i didn't know who he was .
i was 16 .
you are my imagination come to life , " he told me .
he wasn't just a great director .
he gave great advice .
i'm listening .
fefe said you have to live spherically in many directions .
never lose your childish enthusiasm , and things will come your way .
so now i was getting posthumous advice from il maestro , and i tried to follow it by pulling ivy , spherically and with childish enthusiasm ,
oh , my god .
niente qui ,
niente , not here .
did you look under the bed?
could you look under the pillow?
huh !
no .
it's a joke .
maybe he moved out already .
snakes are famous for changing their minds .
what am i doing here all by myself?
don't you think it's strange?
me in this big house?
excuse me .
i'm sorry .
you are cold , signora mayes .
yeah .
thank you .
do you know the most surprising thing about divorce?
it doesn't actually kill you ,
iike a bullet to the heart or a head on car wreck .
it should .
when someone you've promised to cherish till death do you part says , " i never loved you , " it should kill you instantly .
you shouldn't have to wake up day after day after that , trying to understand how in the world you didn't know .
the light just never went on , you know .
i must have have known , of course , but i was too scared to see the truth .
then fear just makes you so stupid .
no .
it's not stupid , signora mayes .
l'amore e cieco ,
oh , love is blind .
yeah , we have that saying , too .
everybody has that saying because it's true everywhere .
i don't want to be blind anymore .
this house has three bedrooms .
what if there's never anyone to sleep in them?
and the kitchen , what if there's never anyone to cook for?
i wake up in the night thinking , " you idiot .
i mean , you're the stupidest woman in the world .
you bought a house for a life you don't even have .
why did you do it , then?
because i'm sick of being afraid all the time and because i still want things .
i want a wedding in this house , and i want a family in this house .
signora , between austria and ltaly , there is a section of the alps called the semmering .
it is an impossibly steep , very high part of the mountains .
they built a train track over these alps to connect vienna and venice .
they built these tracks before there was a train in existence that could make the trip .
they built it because they knew someday the train would come .
i think your snake has gone for the evening .
yes .
i think you're right .
signora ,
please stop being so sad .
if you continue like this ,
i will be forced to make love to you .
and i've never been unfaithful to my wife .
buonanotte , signora ,
yes .
buonanotte , signor martini .
grazie ,
prego ,
a train track through the alps before there was a train ,
signor martini wants me to have faith ,
something i've never been good at , and now i'm even worse at ,
not that i don't want faith , i'm jealous of the believers ,
but as a fallen away methodist ,
i do not expect to emerge from all of this a catholic , although i admit some interior juggling is going on ,
to my surprise , i have become friendly with mary ,
it started the night she stood by me through the storm , knowing full well i'm not a catholic ,
yet , somehow , she seems more like mary , my favorite aunt , than santa maria ,
aunt mary is everywhere here , her calm presence assuring us that all things will go on as they have before , [ singing " adeste fidelis " ]
buon natale ,
buon natale ,
this is my wife , flora .
oh !
and my daughter , stella .
stella , buon natale ,
bellissima ,
what a beautiful family .
wow .
i thought i might see you , so i have a gift for you .
it is san lorenzo .
he is the patron saint of cooks .
apparently , he was martyred on a grill and seared until he said ,
turn me over .
i'm done on this side .
no !
yes .
and now he is the favorite saint of chefs .
oh !
i think if you prayed to him , he will help you find someone to cook for .
thank you , signor martini .
merry christmas , signora ,
buon natale ,
my prayers to san lorenzo were quickly answered ,
i realized i already had someone to cook for ,
plenty of someones ,
bravo !
ahh !
bravo !
bravo !
bravo !
aah !
aah !
good .
see , frances?
italian is easy .
no !
aah !
aah !
aah !
have you talked to her yet?
si ,
i have talked to her .
why don't you go sit next to her?
go on .
okay .
katherine !
francesca !
come up !
i'm having my portrait painted .
katherine?
come through .
i'm in here .
oh .
i'll come back another time .
why?
you don't bother me .
frances , this is zeus .
he's an art student from macedonia .
he's staying with me while he's studying the tuscan light .
more vino , darling .
hmm .
he's not bad .
he's not good , either .
look , i'm going to go , but i'll come back another time .
oh , you're so boring !
what?
i said you're boring .
look at you !
you're sad .
again !
you're like a big black hole .
excuse me , but i ...
fefe always said , " regrets are a waste of time .
they're the past crippling you in the present .
i just walked in the door .
how are you ever going to be happy if you keep wallowing?
listen , when i was a little girl ,
i used to spend hours looking for ladybugs .
finally , i'd just give up and fall asleep in the grass .
when i woke up , they were crawling all over me .
so?
so go work on your house and forget about it .
i said go !
i'm going !
work on the house and forget about it ,
gee , why hadn't i thought of that?
there comes a time in every remodeler's life when one doesn't want any more helpful advice ,
there comes a time when you no longer want shaky guys staring at you thinking god knows what , whispering things in polish you're really glad you don't understand , [ speaking polish ]
there's only so much you can take before there comes a time when you just have to get out ,
signorina ,
bella !
great .
hilarious .
goodbye !
you are american?
english?
irish?
there you are .
