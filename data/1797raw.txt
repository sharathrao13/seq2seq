in short , ladies and gentlemen of the board ... ... costs are down , revenues are up ... ... and our stock has never been higher .
wonderful news , norman .
that's why we're selling the company .
what?
quest is recapitalizing in the wake of the bombing .
expanding .
they made a tender offer we can't ignore .
why wasn't i told?
they don't want a power struggle with entrenched management .
the deal is off if you come with it .
the board expects your resignation in 30 days .
you can't do this to me .
i started this company .
you know how much i sacrificed? !
oh , max .

you know who i am .
i do?
your friendly neighborhood spider man .
incredible?
what do you mean he's incredible?
no .
all right , wait .
stay there .
i'm gonna come over .
no , i'm gonna come
all right .
fine .
will you call me in the morning?
and we'll go and have breakfast and ... ... i want to buy you something .
because i want to .
it'll make you feel better .
okay .
and what do you mean , incredible?
all right .
i'm sorry .
sleep tight .
don't let the bedbugs
she's all right .
she's just a little rattled .
look , pete , i should have told you about us .
but you should know i'm crazy about her .
it's just , you know , you never made a move .
you're right .
i didn't .
i'm gonna get some rest .
i'm gonna stay up for a while .
what was that thing?
i don't know .
whatever it is , somebody has to stop it .
somebody there?
somebody .
who said that?
don't play the innocent with me .
you've known all along .
where are you?
follow the cold shiver running down your spine .
i'm right here .
i don't understand .
did you think it was coincidence?
so many good things , all happening for you .
all for you .
norman .
what do you want?
to say what you won't .
to do what you can't .
to remove those in your way .
the board members .
you killed them .
we killed them .
we?
remember?
your little accident in the laboratory .
the performance enhancers .
bingo .
me !
your greatest creation .
power beyond your wildest dreams .
and it's only the beginning .
there's only one who can stop us .
or imagine if he joined us .
spider man .
and the green goblin .
the green goblin .
you like that?
made it up myself .
these weirdos all got to have a name .
mr. jameson
hoffman !
yeah?
copyright " green goblin .
i want a quarter every time it's said .
how about " green meanie "?
spider man wasn't attacking .
that's slander .
it is not .
i resent that .
slander is spoken .
in print , it's libel .
you don't trust anybody .
i trust my barber .
are you his lawyer?
let him sue .
get rich like a normal person .
that's what made this country
jameson , you slime .
who takes the pictures of spider man?
i don't know .
his stuff comes by mail .
liar !
i swear .
he's the one who can bring me to him .
i don't know who he is .
you are useless .
set him down , tough guy .
speak of the devil .
i knew you two were in this together !
kiddo , let mom and dad talk for a minute .
sleep ....
wake up , little spider .
wake up .
no , you're not dead yet .
just paralyzed ... ... temporarily .
you're an amazing creature , spider man .
you and i are not so different .
i'm not like you .
you're a murderer .
well , to each his own .
i chose my path , you chose the way of the hero .
and they found you amusing for a while , the people of this city .
but the one thing they love more than a hero ... ... is to see a hero fail , fall , die trying .
in spite of everything you've done for them , eventually , they will hate you .
why bother?
because it's right .
here's the real truth .
there are eight million people in this city .
and those teeming masses exist for the sole purpose ... ... of lifting the few exceptional people onto their shoulders .
you , me ... ... we're exceptional .
i could squash you like a bug right now .
but i'm offering you a choice .
join me .
imagine what we could accomplish together .
what we could create .
or we could destroy .
cause the deaths of countless innocents in selfish battle ... ... again and again and again until we're both dead .
is that what you want?
think about it , hero .
in spite of everything you've done for them , eventually , they will hate you .
it's me again .
how was your audition?
how'd you know?
the hot line .
your mom ... ... told my aunt , told me .
so you just came by?
i was in the neighborhood .
needed to see a friendly face .
i took two buses and a cab to get in the neighborhood , but ....
so how'd it go?
they said i needed acting lessons .
a soap opera told me i needed acting lessons .
let me buy you a cheeseburger .
the sky's the limit , up to $7 84 .
i'd like a cheeseburger .
oh , but i'm going out to dinner with harry .
come with us .
no , thanks .
how's it going with ...?
never mind .
that's none of my business .
it's not?
why so interested?
i'm not .
you're not?
well , why would i be?
i don't know .
why would you be?
i , that's a
i don't know .
sorry you won't come with us .
i'd better run , tiger .
hey , check it out , man .
come on , man .
hey , where you going , baby?
come on !
get off me !
wait !
you have a knack for getting in trouble .
you have a knack for saving my life .
i think i have a superhero stalker .
i was in the neighborhood .
you are amazing .
some people don't think so .
but you are .
nice to have a fan .
do i get to say thank you this time?
wait .
let me in !
my baby's in there !
let me go !
the roof's collapsing !
somebody save my baby !
the roof's about to collapse !
look !
up there !
save my baby , please !
no !
it's okay .
your baby's fine .
oh , my baby !
god bless you , spider man .
bless you .
don't let him get away !
hold it !
you're under arrest .
i'm taking you in .
oh , my god , there's somebody still up there !
i'm going .
i'll be here when you get back .
not coming back .
go !
go !
where are you?
where are you?
i'm gonna get you out of here !
it's okay .
you're pathetically predictable .
like a moth to the flame .
what about my generous proposal?
are you in or are you out?
it's you who's out .
out of your mind .
wrong answer .
oh , great .
no one says no to me !
m. j. , will you stop goofing around?
harry , relax .
he's here .
are you ready?
aunt may .
i'm sorry i'm late .
work was murder .
i picked up a fruitcake .
thank you , mr. osborn .
we're so glad you could come .
who is this lovely young lady?
i'd like you to meet my father .
dad , this is mary jane watson .
i've been looking forward to meeting you .
happy thanksgiving , sir .
now , where is peter?
he'd better remember that cranberry sauce .
oh , that's weird .
i didn't know he was here .
peter?
is that you?
how strange .
there's nobody here .
bit of a slob , isn't he?
all brilliant men are .
hey , everyone .
oh , peter !
it's a jungle out there .
had to beat an old lady with a stick to get these cranberries .
thank you .
now then , everybody sit down ... ... and we can say grace .
here we go .
there we are .
it looks delicious .
will you do the honors?
why , peter , you're bleeding .
i stepped off a curb and got clipped by one of those bike messengers .
well , let me see .
oh , my goodness .
that looks awful .
no , it's nothing .
i'll get the first aid kit .
then we'll say grace .
this is the boys 'first thanksgiving here , and we'll do things properly .
how did you say that happened?
bike messenger .
knocked me down .
lf you'll excuse me , i've got to go .
why?
something has come to my attention .
are you all right?
i'm fine , just fine .
thank you , mrs. parker .
everyone .
enjoy the fruitcake .
dad !
i planned this so you'd meet m. j. , and now you have to leave?
i've got to go .
this girl is important to me .
harry , please .
look at her .
think she's sniffing around because she likes your personality?
what are you saying?
your mother was beautiful .
they're all beautiful until they're snarling after your money like wolves .
you're wrong , dad .
do what you need to with her , then broom her fast .
thanks for sticking up for me , harry .
you heard?
everyone heard that creep .
that creep is my father .
with luck , i'll be half of what he is .
shut up about stuff you don't understand !
harry osborn !
i'm sorry , aunt may .
spider man is all but invincible .
but parker , we can destroy him .
i can't .
betrayal must not be countenanced .
parker must be educated .
what do i do?
instruct him in the matters of loss and pain .
make him suffer .
make him wish he were dead .
yes?
and then grant his wish .
but how?
the cunning warrior attacks neither body nor mind .
t ell me how !
the heart , osborn .
first , we attack his heart .
give us this day our daily bread , and forgive us our trespasses ... ... as we forgive those who trespass against us .
lead us not into temptation , but deliver us
deliver us !
finish it !
finish it !
from evil !
two milligrams lv .
get the bp .
aunt may .
is she gonna be okay?
what happened?
you have to leave .
what happened?
those eyes !
those horrible yellow eyes !
he knows who i am .
i'm sorry .
will she be okay?
she'll be fine .
she's been sleeping all day .
thanks for coming .
of course .
how are you?
you okay about the other night?
yeah , i'm fine .
i just felt bad about leaving aunt may .
have you talked to harry?
he called me .
i haven't called him back .
the fact is ... ... i'm in love with somebody else .
you are?
at least i think i am .
it's not the time to talk about it .
no .
go on .
would i know his name , this guy?
you'll think i'm a little girl with a crush .
trust me .
it's funny .
he's saved my life twice , and i've never even seen his face .
oh .
him .
you're laughing at me .
no , i understand .
he is extremely cool .
but do you think it's true , all the terrible things they say?
not spider man , not a chance in the world .
i know him a little bit .
i'm sort of his unofficial photographer .
has he mentioned me?
yeah .
what'd he say?
i said ....
he asked me what i thought about you .
and what did you say?
i said , " spider man .
i said , " the great thing about m. j ... ... is ... ... when you look in her eyes ... ... and she's looking back in yours ... ... everything feels ... ... not quite normal .
because you feel ... ... stronger ... ... and weaker at the same time .
you feel excited ... ... and at the same time ... ... terrified .
the truth is , you don't know what you feel ... ... except you know what kind of man you want to be .
it's as if you've ... ... reached the unreachable ... ... and you weren't ready for it .
you said that?
well , something like that .
dad?
dad , is that you?
what is it?
you were right about m. j. you're right about everything .
she's in love with peter .
parker?
yeah .
and how does he feel about her?
he's loved her since the 4th grade .
he pretends like he doesn't , but there's no one peter cares for more .
i'm so sorry .
i haven't always been there for you , have l?
you're busy .
you're an important man .
i understand .
that's no excuse .
i'm proud of you .
i've lost sight of that somewhere .
but i'll make it up to you .
i'm going to rectify certain inequities .
wake up , little spider .
wake up .
go home , dear .
you look awful .
and you look beautiful .
thank you .
i don't like to leave you here .
but i'm safe here .
can i do anything for you?
you do too much .
college , a job , all this time with me .
you're not superman , you know .
a smile .
finally .
haven't seen one of those on your face since mary jane was here .
you were supposed to be asleep .
you know , you were about 6 years old when m. j. 's family moved in next door .
when she got out of the car , and you saw her for the first time ... ... you grabbed me and said , " aunt may , is that an angel?
gee , did i say that?
you sure did .
well , harry's in love with her .
she's still his girl .
well , isn't that up to her?
she doesn't really know who i am .
because you won't let her .
you're so mysterious all the time .
tell me , would it be so dangerous ... ... to let mary jane know how much you care?
everybody else knows .
i'll be right back .
but ....
come on , pick up .
hey , m. j. sing your song at the beep .
m. j. , it's peter .
you there?
hello?
you there?
i'm just calling to check up on you .
will you call me when you get in?
all right , well ....
don't ....
don't go up any dark alleys .
hello?
can spider man come out to play?
where is she?
what is that?
that's cool !
the itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout
down came the goblin and took the spider out
goblin , what have you done?
spider man !
this is why only fools are heroes .
let die the woman you love ...
... or suffer the little children .
spider man !
save us !
save us !
make your choice , spider man ... ... and see how a hero is rewarded .
don't do it , goblin !
we are who we choose to be .
now , choose !
no !
everybody stay still !
ahoy up there !
we're gonna bring the barge right under you .
he's coming back !
listen .
i need you to climb down .
i can't .
yes , you can !
m. j. , you can do it .
you have to .
trust me .
hold on tight and go quickly .
hurry !
i can't .
i can't do it .
hang on , mary jane !
he's not gonna make it .
he's gonna make it !
it's time to die .
i got something for you !
we ought to kick your ass !
leave spider man alone !
you'd pick on a guy saving kids?
you mess with spidey , you mess with new york !
you mess with one of us , you mess with all of us !
spider man , watch out !
misery , misery , misery .
that's what you've chosen .
i offered you friendship ... ... and you spat in my face .
you've spun your last web , spider man .
had you not been so selfish , your girlfriend's death ... ... would have been quick .
but now that you've really pissed me off ... ... i'm gonna finish her nice and slow .
m. j. and i ... ... we're gonna have a hell of a time .
peter , stop !
stop !
it's me .
mr. osborn .
thank god for you .
you killed those people on that balcony .
the goblin killed !
i had nothing to do with it !
don't let him take me again .
i beg you .
protect me .
you tried to kill aunt may .
you tried to kill mary jane .
but not you .
i tried to stop it .
but i couldn't stop it .
i would never hurt you .
i knew from the beginning ... ... if anything ever happened to me ... ... it was you i could count on .
you , peter parker , would save me , and so you have .
thank god for you .
give me your hand .
believe in me as i believed in you .
i've been like a father to you .
be a son to me now .
i have a father .
his name was ben parker .
godspeed , spider man .
peter .
don't tell harry .
what have you done?
what have you done? !
i'm so sorry , harry .
i know what it's like to lose a father .
i didn't lose him .
he was stolen from me .
one day spider man will pay .
i swear on my father's grave , spider man will pay .
thank god for you , peter .
you're the only family i have .
no matter what i do ... ... no matter how hard i try ... ... the ones i love will always be the ones who pay .
you must miss him so much .
it's been so hard without him .
there's something i've been wanting to tell you .
when i was up there ... ... and i thought i was gonna die ... ... there was only one person who i was thinking of .
and it wasn't who i thought it'd be .
it was you , pete .
i hope i make it through this ... ... so i can see peter parker's face one more time .
really?
there's only one man who's always been there for me ... ... who makes me feel ... ... iike i'm more than i ever thought i could be .
that i'm just ... ... me .
and that's okay .
the truth is ... ... i love you .
i love you so much , peter .
all i wanted was to tell her how much i loved her .
i can't ....
you can't what?
tell you ... ... everything .
i mean , there's so much to tell .
yeah .
there's so much to tell .
i want you to know ... ... that i will always be there for you .
i will always be there to take care of you .
i promise you that .
i will always be your friend .
only a friend ... ... peter parker?
that's all i have to give .
with great power comes great responsibility .
this is my gift .
my curse .
who am i?
i'm spider man .
