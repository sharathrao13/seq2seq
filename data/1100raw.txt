a guy named fat charlie disappeared on you?

if you want to spend your life chasing nickel and dime papers you go right ahead .
ray , the guy was a difficult mark , and i served him clean .
what else do you want?
you know what i want?
i want you to be more like tony , here .
well , that's impossible .
i walk upright .
what are you saying?
i don't have good posture?
i'm saying you're a neanderthal .
and i'm saying kiss my ass .
my mouth's not big enough .
hey !
hey !
hey !
hey !
look .
you see this?
i gave tony this file two hours ago .
it's done .
what's going on with you , joe?
you used to be my money guy , my assassin .
now in the time it takes you to do one job , wop along cassidy , here serves seven papers .
it would have been eight but i let joe have that one in miami .
the only reason that is is the mook can't take miami .
it's too damn hot down there .
miami's not a city .
it's a steam room with mosquitoes .
oh , that's great , tony .
you're a regular process serving savant .
what'd you call me?
savant that's somebody who's really good at something ...
oh , thanks , joe . ... while being a complete idiot .
hey !
ladies , please !
yeah , you really did serve these really fast .
in fact , you served them yesterday .

what are you talking about?
what's the date today?
it's the the tenth .
it's the 1 1th , numnuts .
give me that .
goddamn it , tony !
relax , ray , relax .
i'll go back to the courthouse .
i'll refile it .
it's the big white building with the pillars in front of it .
hey , screw you , joe .
i'm tired of you calling me stupid .
i'm not the one growing a grapevine in my living room .
this loser thinks he's going to be
ernest and julio freaking gallo .
ray , do you have a job for me , or not?
look , i got one job right now .
it's an important job out of texas .
pays five grand .
well , i was going to give it to tony seeing he's been so hot lately .
but now that we know he can't read a goddamn calendar makes me a little edgy .
so ... here .
what?
you going to give it to joe?
after two months of screwups?
it's going to take him ten weeks to serve it .
well , thanks for the prediction , nostra dumb ass .
don't you have a courthouse to find?
eat me .
eat you?
i've never been that hungry in my life .
listen , joe .
this is the texas branch of my biggest account here in new york .
this file could open up a lot of out of state business for me , you understand?
it's an easy job .
all you gotta do is do it fast .
none of that lollygagging , six day crap on this .
i'm serious .
you got it , boss .
and let me just say , from the bottom of my heart that suit is kicking .

wretched bag .
well , well , there is a god .
actually , it was two ltalians .
do you have any feelings?
do you have any shred of humanity or compassion?
well , little sick dogs pull at my heartstrings but certainly not trophy wives from australia .
australia?
look , first of all , i'm english , you twit .
and second of all , we've had our ups and downs but i stuck it out and trophy wives don't do that .
do you know what?
the guy on the phone was right .
you are an asshole .
hey , i was just doing my jo ...
what guy on the phone?
the guy that called up to my apartment to say you were on your way up with those lovely papers .
somebody tipped you off?
who?
yeah , like i know everyone in new york with a brooklyn accent .
tony .
it's got to be tony .
the son of a bitch .
he's been tipping off my marks for two months .
that's why it's been so hard .
well , my heart bleeds for you .
i'm going to kill that son of a bitch !
mind your own business , pork chop .
goddamn monkeys .
hey , chico make it cooler , cooler .
culo .? tu quieres culo?
yo te doy culo !
not louder .
cooler !
este gringo me molesta ...
no gringo .
italiano .
mambo ltaliano .
no mambo ltaliano .
mambo king , armand assante .
mambo king soy yo .
hey , chico just drop me off in america , okay?
agase para ... carajo , feo !
hey .
hey , i got another question .
how do people do it?
i know you're awake , so stop pretending to be asleep .
actually , i was pretending to be dead but i can't fool you .
how can someone end a marriage like that , just ... pow?
what?
are you telling me you didn't see this coming?
let me guess .
a lot of trips out of town .
go ahead , honey .
go ahead .
don't worry your pretty little head .
i'll take care of the homestead ...
not to mention those extra poker nights with the boys .
gordon doesn't play poker .
missing my point .
look , i've served thousands of subpoenas .
granted , never one to somebody as hot as you .
i don't know your husband but i do have a great deal of insight into men .
and we are mean , hurtful and despicable .
male headquarters would kill me if they knew i was telling you this .
yeah , well , " despicable " is putting it mildly .
and then , you complain that we get half of everything .
believe me , after this type of treatment half is the very least we should get .
the only thing you're getting half of , honey is screwed .
what do you mean?
he served you first .
he's in texas , and he's got home court advantage .
wait .
served me first?
what is this?
third grade?
yeah , sometimes .
texas has the most conservative divorce laws in the country .
not to mention those good ol 'boy judges .
sure most of them aren't married to their first wives .
believe me if i'd known this was coming
i'd have been the one doing the serving .
yeah .
how about that , huh?
whatever .
no , seriously .
what would have happened if i'd served him first?
okay , if you had served him first the trial would have been in new york not in texas where you would have fared a lot better .
50 % better , actually .
hey , i have a proposition for you .
you tear up the papers on me and i'll hire you to serve my husband .
i'll pay you twice what you're getting now .
look , here's what you don't understand .
i've already told them that i served you , okay?
so if i flip it and tag your husband my reputation will be shot .
i'll never work again .
i'll give you ten percent of my divorce settlement .
we own a cattle ranch .
it's worth $20 million . $20 million?
mm hmm .
ten percent of half?
mm hmm .
you're willing to pay me a million dollars .
well , that still leaves nine for me versus next to nothing .
it's kind of a no brainer .
you're really serious?
i think we should draw up a contract .
let's see ...
won't be needing this .
one ... million ...
dollars ...
great , let's go .
thanks a lot .
miami marriott .

yeah , well , all you have to do is point him out and then stay out of sight because if he sees you , we're done .
is it okay if i strangle him from behind?
yes , you can do whatever you want but wait until i serve him .
okay .
let me see that scarf .

hampstead .
hmm , sorry , i'm not familiar with it .
well , it's on the corner of penny lane and abbey road .
hmm ... very interesting .
how many pounds were you looking at losing?
well , i don't think it's important to talk about money at this point , do you?
you see , pounds ... money ...
be quiet .
how exactly did you hear about us
mr. and mrs ...
poppins "?
well , we have an acquaintance here at the club a gordon moore .
solid , solid , solid fellow .
absolutely .
as a matter of fact
i believe mr. moore's working out here this morning .
perhaps we'll run into him .
perhaps .
i'll just show you the men's area now .
jolly good .
mrs. poppins , if you'll wait here for just a moment we'll be back in a jiffy , as you say .
oh , okay , thanks .
i should tell you , i don't like to lift things .

way to lay low back there .
well , you said to point him out .
i just pointed him out .
hey , you are going to have to get in control of your anger , okay?
you made us look like fools in there .
i did?
well , hey , at least i wasn't beaten up by a girl .
hey , that was not a girl .
i distinctly saw an adam's apple and a bulge that i was not comfortable with .
the only thing we had going for us was the element of surprise , and you blew that .
look , i know gordon's habits .
i can easily find him again .
oh , what do you think?
he's just going to sit around , waiting for us to serve him?
no , he's history .
all he has to do is jump on the first international flight and then we're done , all right?
even if i find him
i can't serve him outside the united states .
i don't like your tone .
oh , you don't like my tone , your highness?
don't forget , whenever i want , i can serve your papers again .
look , you can stand there and threaten me or we could just get in the car and go and find gordon .
oh , yeah?
okay , where do you want to go ... boss?
well , as your boss , i'd be interested in your suggestions .
this is crazy .
you're crazy and i quit .
hey , i thought you were quitting .
who the hell am i going to quit to?
i gave up half my life for this crap .
so , what are we going to do first?
well , i think we , uh and when i say " we , " i mean you should find a mute button for yourself .

yeah , well , the way i see it all those jobs were mine before you came along .
so i was just taking back what already belonged to me .
you grew up around a lot of lead paint , didn't you?

asshole .
the pepsi monster smash comes to dallas
the pepsi monster smash comes to dallas this friday , friday , friday !
and two shows saturday at the union arena .
see cyclops thrash ...
baby , i was down for the count
swimmin 'around , about to drown ...
i think we should find a hotel .
what?
we're making great time .
you said we're like three hours away .
all i know is , is that if you sneak onto a cattle ranch in the middle of the night two things are guaranteed to happen : one , you're going to tread in cow shit ; and two , you're going to get shot .
so , you want to get a hotel?
i'm living proof i can't forget your face
it's not impossible ...
come and get 'em , joe .
i'll be waiting .
oh , your sister's ass .
don't shoot !
don't shoot !
hold up !
i'm no thief !
i'm just a process server .
ow !
let me get this straight .
you're telling me you're here from the motel's parent company doing spot inspections?
and i should give you a room for free so you can see how it is?
that's correct , sir .
and let me just say the degree of professionalism that you are exhibiting here today will undoubtedly go in my report .
well , let me just say that either you fork over $34 . 95 , or you are plumb out of luck , mister .
got me?
we're sleeping in the car .
let me have a go .
sir , we've been robbed .
please take pity on us .
lady , there ain't no way in hell i'm going to give you a room here for free .
that's , uh ... room 17 .
thank you .
oh , and we do have suites available as well .
and let me know if you need any ice .
i love you !
bummer .
hey ...
how was your bath?
you mean shower .
there's no tub in here .
oh , well , i'll call the concierge .
oh , no , wait a minute you got a free room in a dump .
tease me all you like .
i just don't feel right if i don't have a bath .
i don't get you americans with your two minute showers .
well , it could be worse .
we could be french and skip the whole thing .
you must admit , though it's pretty cool the way i got us our free room .
oh , yeah .
what are you doing?
well , i've gotten into bed , and now i'm going to sleep .
no , i am the girl ; i get the bed .
all right , i'll tell you what why don't you draw an imaginary line and i will promise not to cross it , okay?
okay .
my line goes all the way around the bed .
i knew you were going to say that .
thank you .
oh , yeah .
comfy?
yeah .
light's out?
no , you know what
i'm just going to stay up and read the bible for a while .
good night .
yeah , i guess i got the gist of it .
you know , assuming you serve gordon tomorrow what are you going to do with the money?
why do girls always have another question after " good night "?
come on , i'm just curious .
well ... if you must know
i was kind of hoping to have my own vineyard .
napa valley or somewhere .
come on , i'm being serious .
oh , seriously .
well ...
a while back i was this hotshot attorney .
i had all the attachments that go with that gig .
you know , a big house , nice car ... beautiful girlfriend .
fiancee actually .
that sounds terrible .
i can see why you turned your back on it .
well , anyway , i was given this high profile case to defend this guy in the cement business .
in other words , the mob .
really?
how did you know that?
i have an eye for that kind of stuff .
and he told me he was in the mob .
then i realized
i'd just become this cliche .
some sleazy defense attorney .
and at that moment , boom
i got out .
i don't blame you .
well , the beautiful fiancee did .
as soon as the money ran out , so did she .
ow .
yeah , ow .
you know , all kidding aside after you quit , didn't you miss the money?
well , being successful isn't all about money .
no .
so your girlfriend ditched you because you didn't have enough money and my husband's ditching me to get it all .
hmm .
all right , good night then .
good night then .
oh , all right .
all right , what?
i moved the line .
oh .
it's still there .
i just moved it a little .
oh .
come on .
thanks .
thank you .
oh , sorry .
that's okay .
just don't let it happen again .
gentlemen , i'd like to welcome you to my ranch .
now , i know in your country it's polite to remove your shoes when you visit someone's humble abode ...
who are all those japanese guys around gordon?
i have no idea .
if you do that around here ...
go on , go serve him .
okay .
oh , no , wait .
who's that?
that is trouble .
wyatt earp looks pissed .
quick , let's get out of here .
hey , vernon .
i need you for a minute .
boy , am i glad to see you two .
really?
of course he is .
follow me .
okay .
well , you sure made it fast enough .
now , we're just having the damnedest old time milking that old boy today .
well , that's the problem .
see , if you want to get the milk you need to use a girl cow .
uh , you are the vet , right?
yes , i am the vet .
and i'm the vet's nurse .
um , it's casual friday .
well , tornado over there , he's normally our feistiest bull .
good for at least a quart a week .
but today , hell , we can't even get his pump primed .
uh , would you all excuse me please?
i need to talk with my ... nurse .
excuse me .
tell me they are not talking about what i think they're talking about .
what do you think they're talking about?
masturbating an impotent bull .
ding , ding , ding , ding , ding !
so what do you think , doc?
well , you know what , we just got a page uh , telling us that a sheep has fallen into a lake and is shrinking at an amazing rate .
just getting smaller and smaller .
go look over there .
yes , sir .
you better find somebody or it's your ass .
how small can a sheep get , i guess .
so , um , how do you get things started?
what do you do to get the bulls ... ready?
you know , the regular way .
but we've been trying that for over an hour .
poor ol 'mickey , there , can't even lift his arms up no more .
well , maybe it's just a question of inspiration .
i mean , that is a very attractive rump but , uh , maybe tornado needs a little bit more oomph .
like what?
have you tried a barry white cd?
why don't you just do what the other doc did when this happened to attila?
you know , relieve the pressure on the prostate?
prostate pressure .
right , um ...
nurse , did you bring the tools?
um , no , i'm afraid i forgot them .
she forgot the tools .
can't really do anything without the tools .
that's all right , doc .
we got everything you need .
oh , dear god .
here , let me help .
let's get you nice and lubricated .
how far up is the prostate?
when you think you've got there , keep going .
we're ready when you are , doc .
you fellows haven't been feeding tornado any mexican food , have you?
whoa .
get your dumb ass over here !
yes , mr. vernon .
keep looking !
i'm sorry .
go on , doc .
he ain't gonna give you an invitation .
especially not from this end .
how's it feel in there , doc?
compared to what?
better go a little further , doc .
ain't nothing happening yet .
let me help you , doc .
whoo ha !
that's the spot , doc !
you got it !
do it till you're satisfied
whatever it is
do it , do it till you're satisfied ...
damn , that thing sure looks like a fire hose .
do it till you're satisfied
whatever it is
do it , do it ...
i'm uncomfortable .
help , oh ...
sure wish you folks could've been here a little earlier .
mr. moore came by and had a bunch of those corporate fellas with him and it was damn embarrassing .
old tornado couldn't put on his usual show .
look at him go .
oh , great now l i've lost my ring .
what , was he giving them
iike a little special tour or something?
i think it was a little more than a little tour .
i hear he's trying to sell the whole damn company .
hey , you hear that , doc?
mr. moore is trying to sell the whole damn company .
that's fascinating .
i can't believe that gordon is trying to sell his company .
mind you , i have to say
i think it's good news for us .
well , you know if he's in the middle of a big sales pitch he can hardly skip town .
you don't seem very excited .
did you see what i just did in there?
i'm going to need a minute , okay?
a bull is lighting a cigarette in there because of me .
there goes my mark .
hey , come on .
let's go back to dallas .
oh my god !
quick !
no , no , no ...
oh ...
come on , quick .
that guy must hate veterinarians .
no .
no , mr. cedron every ... everything's under control , okay?
i just need a little more time .
if everything's so goddamn under control tell me what that process server was doing snooping around
gordon's ranch up in durango this morning .
what?
listen , dirtbag , by tomorrow morning
i'm going to have these papers out to three other firms .
that means you better get her served by the end of the day , or you're off the case .
you understand?
yeah , yeah .
page tony !
tony's holding on line two .
how'd he do that?
where the hell are you? !
don't give me any lip , ray .
i got shot .
what?
some nurse is about to pick pellets out of my back with a pair of needle nosed pliers .
so just chill , all right?
lucky for you these wounds are only superficial .
first we got to mow that lawn .
i've been meaning to get that done anyway .
mm hmm .
tony , where are you now?
amarillo .
i found out joe and the girl were going to serve
mr. moore at his ranch in amarillo so i figured i'd ambush 'em .
amarillo?
father , help me .
they are in durango .
du durango?
what the h ...?
you know , that joe's getting to be one big pain in my ...
sorry .
must've snagged a weed .
i got a goddamn butcher here !
durango .
durango !
yeah .
oh , man .
mm hmm ...
whoa , nice house .
thanks .
you know what?
i can't wait to check gordon's files to see just who he thinks he's selling my company to .
whoa , whoa , whoa .
what if somebody's home?
there's only maria , my housekeeper .
all right , at least do me a favor , okay?
you go through the back and get the files and i'll distract the housekeeper .
all right , but be nice , okay?
i really like her .
i think i can handle that .
mm hmm , mm hmm ...
hi .
holy ...
can i help you?
are you ...
maria?
no , i'm kate .
do you know maria?
do i know maria?
do i know ...?
yes .
maria's my , uh ... second cousin , twice removed .
oh , my !
well , let me get her for you ...
oh , no , no , don't do that .
if i know maria and i do she's not going to want to come downstairs until she looks like salma hayek if you know what i'm saying .
oh , okay .
do you ...?
do you have ...?
do yo ...
do you have a bathroom or something because when you say big gulp up here in texas you're not kidding around .
oh , of course .
come on in .
oh , gracias .
don't worry .
it's just number one .
um , let me show you where it is .
so , are you from el salvador?
what?
well , maria's from el salvador so i figured ...
oh , that's right .
el salvador high .
go , lguanas .
cha cha cha .
well , your english is very good .
well , we had cable , so , you know .
oh ...
all right , if you just look ...
is that all wine?
yeah , my boyfriend has quite the collection .
well , he is a lucky man , you pink goddess of love .
no more callers .
we've got a winner .
wow .
i take it y'all don't have a lot of wine down in el salvador .
what?
oh , yes , no .
where i'm from , it's mostly margaritas .
ole .
have you ever had a cabernet blend that is so good you drink it and drink it and then you pour it all over your privates?
i'm sorry , i'm not all that into wines .
but my gordy sure is .
my gordy "? !
oh , boy .
who the hell are you? !
oh , you must be sara .
and you must be banging my husband .
i am truly sorry , sara .
mrs. moore to you , okay?
look , things happen .
you shouldn't blame yourself .
blame myself?
are you insane?
i'm blaming you , you twinkie and that asshole of a husband of mine .
so ...
come on , you !
well , you just got a quick glimpse into your future .
when it happens to you , page me .
adios , twinkie .
whoa .
let's take the jag .
yeah , let's take the jag .
i'd give my life for a hot bath .
what?
a hot ...
are we suddenly deaf?
no .
i just like hearing you say " hot bath .
oh .
well , i'd really like one .
i think i saw a motel 6 around here somewhere .
wouldn't you prefer a five star hotel?
sara , your breasts are great , but ...
joe .
uh , i don't think they're going to get us into a five star hotel .
do you think cash would?
oh , yeah .
oh , hello , marble bathtub .
yes !
do you mind if i have a $9 bottle of water?
coming up .
thanks .
so , it says here that gordon's going to sell all his assets to some company kobe west?
yeah , and , let's not forget , behind my back .
music?
yeah .
so , a quick divorce then he makes the deal , huh?
nice .
yeah , i know .
seems like gordon cares about the money more than anything .
unbelievable .
yeah , unbelievable .
i have something else to show you .
i did a bit more stealing from gordon .
in fact , i got his passport so he can't leave the country .
nice work , 99 .
thank you .
hey , you know what?
he went to st. barth's twice in the last month .
and , hey , look at this .
acapulco on the 17th .
that was our wedding anniversary .
i distinctly remember him saying he had to do business in omaha .
instead , he was , um , doing kate in mexico .
sara , if gordon can't tell how beautiful and sexy and intelligent you are , then he is an idiot .
and now i'm an idiot for saying way too much .
didn't sound like too much to me .
'cause when we're torn apart
shattered and scarred
love has the grace to save us
we're just two tarnished hearts
when in each other's arms ...
am i hearing waves?
don't you mean fireworks?
no , waves .
bugger !
oh !
oh , god .
sorry about that .
no , no , that's ... that's okay .
well , i think i'll just , uh , go ahead and get in the bath .
great idea .
i got some mr. bubbles in my bag .
alone .
you know , i think our priority has to be to find gordon .
business first .
right , yeah .
business first .
you know , i was just about to say the same thing , so ...
okay .
okay .
well , i'm going to go out and get some fresh air ... alone .
hi .
hi .
i'm a veterinarian .
a cow just beeped me .
my ship came in , and she sunk it
i was the toast of the town , and she drunk it
i had a run of good luck
and she ran it right into the ground
and now she's puttin 'on a show
and i get to play the clown
i had the wind in my sails , and she took it ...
hey , hey , hey .
how's maria?
very funny .
can i get you something , honey?
i would really love a miller longneck .
you got it .
let's get down to business , shall we?
okay .
look , gordon is a complete jerk .
this much we agree on .
and believe me , i didn't need his ex wife to tell me that .
i'm in it for the money .
really?
yeah .
and i know how this works .
if you serve gordon first then he's going to new york and sara gets half of a whole lot of money .
but to serve him , you have to find him .
and you know where he is .
look , there is no way that gordon's marrying me without a prenup so if i want to be a really rich lady and i do
i have got to wait on him hand and foot for the next 20 years .
thank you .
thank you .
or ...
i can serve him up to you for , let's say ... a million dollars?
and i'll never have to see him again .
everybody wins .
except for gordo .
exactly .
just one snag , though .
none of the money is mine .
i'd have to talk to sara first .
so talk .
hey .
hey .
nice robe .
thank you .
where'd you get to?
you'll see .
hmm?
what the hell is she doing here?
she paged me .
why?
look , before you get all in a ... tizzy hear her out , okay?
she's got a great plan .
look , before we get into all that
i just wanted to say , sara
i feel really badly about stealing your husband .
so badly , in fact , that there's a guy i'd like you to meet .
sara moore , you are hereby served for divorce under the laws governing the great state of texas .
joe !
do something .
take another one for my buddy
joe here , just to bust his balls .
cheese .
beautiful , beautiful .
thank you .
mmm ...
classic honey trap .
oldest trick in the book .
you should read it sometime .
oh , and i'll see you back in new york when you come to clean out your desk ass wipe .
look what i got .
he is cute .
it's too bad he's just a process server .
so , one look at a girl in tight pants and big tits and suddenly you're stupid?
it's not the way this was supposed to go down .
how could you blow this?
it seemed like a good idea at the time .
look , sara , can we just focus on what we have to do now?
yes , we can .
you can focus on getting the hell out of this hotel room .
go .
get out of here .
leave .
good bye .
good bye?
that's it?
yeah .
go on .
there's nothing else to say .
you a genius , you hear me?
a goddamn genius !
that's all right .
you know what?
it's only been three white geniuses ever .
oh , yeah .
da vinci , stallone in the first rocky and now you , tony .
oh , thank you , ray .
i swear ...
i love you for this , boy .
i love you for this .
you know what?
i need you to fax me a copy of the papers take the originals down to the courthouse and get your butt back here .
oh , yeah .
i'm going to buy you the biggest steak in manhattan .
you hear me?
on my way .
on my way , fast as i can .
okay .
look here , you know what?
it's okay ... fly first class .
first class?
good .
first class ... all right .
what?
whoa , whoa ... wait a minute .
make that business class .
business?
okay .
mm hmm .
i gotcha , uh huh , huh
you thought i didn't see ya now , didn't ya?
uh huh ... now give me what you promised me
give it here , come on !
i wore myself out .
did he ...?
wait a minute , i need a phone .
i need a phone !
ray , joe's on line one .
hello , loser .
you little dirty ... you ... you tried to double cross me , didn't you?
you know what?
i got something for you .
it's over .
yeah , i guess you really got me , ray .
that's right .
who's my bitch , huh?
who's my bi ... tch?
yeah , i'm your bitch .
so , uh , did tony make the plane okay?
you know what?
he sure did .
and he's flying first class , too .
oh ... see ...
i was really hoping that he didn't drop the papers off at city hall .
well , you can hope all you want to , gladys
'cause he did .
it's over .
now , you probably have a , uh ... copy of that file lying around somewhere .
would you mind , uh , telling me what time my career officially ended?
i'd love to know that .
7 : 04 .
you hear that?
remember it , write it down , paint a picture
i don't care what you do .
seven , zero , and then it's a big four after that .
it's over .
15 .
looks like retardo montalban forgot to set his watch back .
with the time difference between here and new york
i can still serve gordon .
i've still got 49 minutes .
49 .
you know that number .
your l . q.
hello?
gordon moore , milt .
what do you got?
you want to hear what's great?
your guy's got lojack .
for a very reasonable $50 surcharge
i can tell you exactly where he is right now .
milt , you are a beautiful , beautiful man .
all right , he's at the southwest corner of lakeville and beverly .
i looked it up .
it's some fancy steak house .
you got it .
you just made five grand .
sure , but after taxes ...?
on the screens ahead of you , we will run our safety video .
but first , the captain has turned on the fasten seat belt sign , and we'll be departing shortly .
please remain seated as we back away from the gate .
sir , please take your seat .
no , excuse me .
uh , i'm a ...
i'm a heart surgeon and i got a patient that needs an emergency ... heart .
what's the matter?
i don't look like a goddamn heart surgeon to you? !
get in .
are you high?
this is better .
look , we don't have time for this .
it's over , you idiot .
you've blown it .
we have another hour to get gordon .
an hour?
yeah , uh , mrs. siebler , good news ... yeah .
we we got her .
uh huh , yeah , we did .
listen , there is just one tiny little thing .
we didn't " get her " get her , though .
i ...
i mean , in a way , we got her but not like if you get somebody .
you know how , you say
iike if you was playing hide and go get it and you get it , but you don't really get none of it but you get it?
that's kind of the way that we got her is she got , but not really got , if you know what i'm saying .
it's kind of an enigma .
now to us , beef might be a big deal but to a cow , it's just another day .
you know what to do .
keep them boys tethered .
sit .
shh .
oh , and i got a belly full of steer .
gordon moore !
i am hereby here to serve you !
gordo !
this is warren .
hey , warren ...
gordon , finally , damn .
look , sara's been served but there's been a problem .
hey , you're telling me there's a problem .
she and that process server are crawling all over my ass right now .
i got you , gordo !
ooh ... damn longhorns .
uh , gordon ...
hang on .
gordo !
okay , go ahead .
yeah?
gordon , this whole thing's a little difficult to explain right now .
they can still serve you , gordon so you can't let them catch you or you're screwed .
just stay away from them for the next 22 minutes .
that'll be till 7 : 04 .
can you do that , do you think?
uh ...
