lake michigan .
it was fucked up , man .
this little girl , probably 4 or 5 .
we made eye contact , which was a weird thing , you know ... ... and she was yelling for me to help her .
yeah?
what did you do?
i ran to the lifeguard , who was busy talking to her boyfriend at the time ... ... and i yelled , you know , " there's this girl drowning .
and she couldn't see her .
probably thought i was making it up .
and then a second later all you could hear was this horrible screaming .
it was that little girl's mother , dude .
her kid was dead .
jesus .
i had nightmares for years after that .
i mean , i'd wake up every fucking night hearing that mother scream .
i just ....
i just felt like i could have done more .
you did the right thing .
could've been a double drowning .
yeah , well , i didn't see it that way at the time .
all i knew was this little girl was dead and her mother's life was ruined .
what makes you think of this now?
bubble gum .

josh , come here , dude .
yeah , what?
it's not their fault oli disappeared , so stop acting like it is .
i'm annoyed he'd ditch us .
i'm pissed too .
but we're not in america .
i mean , people meet each other and split without saying shit .
it's just how they do it over here .
as well as we may think we know oli , we don't really know him .
he could've gone somewhere with that girl .
fuck , maybe he's in iceland .
the guy's got a daughter .
so let's look at our options .
we can a , fuck these girls one more night and then head to barcelona ... ... or b , not fuck them , then head to barcelona anyway .
think about it .
when i'm studying for the bar and you're writing your thesis ... ... this is the shit we're gonna think about .

you buy things , you sell them .
you make money , you spend money .
what kind of life is that?
a surgeon ... ... he holds the very essence of life in his hands .
your life .
he touches it .
he has a relationship with it .
he's part of it .

he just wouldn't check out without so much as leaving a note , you know .
he's the responsible one .

someone misplace if he leaves note .
it is not uncommon .
