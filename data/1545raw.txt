are you all right?
i have no excuse .
it's all our fault .
my wife was driving .
are you all right?
the murderers must introduce themselves !
my name's alman .
that's mywife berit .
you can see she has been an actress .
that's the complication we were discussing when
come here , berit , and say you're sorry .
i'm so sorry .
it was all my fault .
i was just going to hit my husband when that curve appeared .
god punishes some people at once , eh , you catholic?
let's get your car upright .
oh , never mind us .
please .
shut up , sten .
some people are unselfish , though you don't think so .
my wife is a little nervous .
we've had a shock .
just look at him measuring his strength with the youngsters , straining his flabby muscles to show off in front of that cute girl .
darling , you might have a stroke .
my wife likes ridiculing me .
i let her .
it's psychotherapy .
i never know whether mywife is really crying or just play acting .
i'll be damned if it isn't real .
it happens when you catch a glimpse of death .
can't you shut up?
my wife can really live a part .
for two years , she made me think she had cancer and plagued us with every possible symptom , even though the doctors could find nothing wrong with her .
eventually we believed her more than the doctors !
it's natural that you're upset , but why not leave your wife in peace for a while?
a woman has a right to her tears , eh?
don't get in the way of a woman's tears .
you are beautiful , but old berit's a bit past her prime .
so you can afford to defend her .
i sympathize with her .
for several reasons .
very sarcastic !
yet you don't seem in the least hysterical .
but little berit is .
do you know what that means for me?
i gather you're a catholic .
quite right .
that's how i stand it .
we ridicule each other .
she has her hysteria .
i have my catholicism .
so , you see , we need each other .
it's only egoism that we haven't killed each other .
there it came .
that's what is called syncopes , isn't it?
very funny .
if i'd had a stopwatch , i could have timed the explosion .
shut up !
shut up !
this may be too blunt , but for the children's sake , will you please get out .
forgive us , if you can .
it was with mixed feelings i saw this region again .
i had my first practice here , and my old mother lives nearby .
hello there , doctor .
so you're in these parts again , doctor?
shall i fill it up?
pass me the key to the hood .
eva !
come here a moment !
it's dr. borg in person .
mom and dad and the whole countryside still talk about him .
the world's best doctor .
let's call the baby after him .
isak akerman not a bad name for a prime minister .
suppose it's a girl .
we only have boys .
and how's your father these days?
oh , dad's getting a bit decrepit .
but mom's as lively as a cricket .
and you're going to see your mother , doctor?
she's amazing .
she must be at least 95 .
ninety six .
imagine that .
what do i oweyou?
this is on eva and me !
absolutely not !
don't insult us , doctor .
we can do the proper thing too !
why should you pay for my gasoline?
there are things that can't be paid back not even with gas .
we haven't forgotten .
ask anyone around here .
they all remember your kindness .
maybe i should have stayed here .
what doyou mean?
you said you should have stayed .
did l?
well , thanks anyway .
let me know when the new son arrives , and i'll be the godfather .
you know where to find me .
during lunch i was in good spirits and told the young people about my years as district medical officer .
my stories were quite a success , and i don't think they laughed merely out of courtesy .
i had wine with the lunch , and then port with the coffee .
ah , when creation shows so much beauty , how radiant must be its source !
he is going to be a minister , and viktor a doctor .
reciting poetry is against our agreement not to discuss god or science on this trip .
it was beautiful !
how can anyone today study to become a minister !
your rationalism is as dry as dust .
i say that modern man
i say that believes only in himself and his biological death .
modern man is a figment of your imagination .
man regards death with horror .
religion for the people .
opium for the aching limb .
how sweet they both are !
i always agree with the one i spoke with last .
once you believed in santa claus now in god .
you never had any imagination !
what do you say , professor?
whatever i said would be met with tolerant irony , so i'll say nothing .
i'm sure they'll be disappointed .
no , sara .
very , very happy .
where is the friend i seek at break of day?
when night falls , when
when night falls , i still have not found him .
my burning heart shows me his traces
are you religious , professor?
i see his traces wherever flowers bloom .
his love is mingled with every air .
his voice calls in the summer wind .
not bad for a love poem .
i've gone all solemn again for no reason .
well , i'm going to call on my mother .
i'll be back soon .
may i come?
of course .
here comes the thunder .
i have just sent you a telegram on your great day .
and now you're here .
we all have our bright moments , dear mother .
is that your wife over there?
i don't want to talk to her .
she has done us too much harm .
no , mother dear .
this is evald's wife , marianne .
well , let her come and say hello to me .
good day , mrs. borg .
and why are you gadding about like this?
i have been in stockholm for a visit .
why aren't you with evald and the child?
evald and i have no children .
these young people nowadays !
i bore ten children .
will you please hand me that big box over there .
my mother lived in this house .
do you remember coming to see her , isak?
very well .
here are some of your toys .
i have been trying to think which of you owned what .
ten children , and all dead except isak .
twenty grandchildren .
evald's the only one who comes to see me .
don't get me wrong i'm not complaining .
fifteen great grandchildren whom i have never seen .
i send presents for all their birthdays .
i get letters of thanks , but nobody bothers to visit me unless they want to borrow money .
oh , i know i'm tiresome .
don't think that , mother .
and i've one more fault .
i don't die .
the inheritance isn't being divided up the way these crafty young people had planned .
this was sigbritt's doll .
she got it when she turned eight .
i made the dress myself .
but she never cared for it so it went to charlotta .
she took care of it i remember it clearly .
do you see who that is?
sigfrid was three and you were five .
and myself .
what a fright one looked in those days .
may i have it?
by all means .
it's only rubbish .
and here's a coloring book .
i don't know whose it was .
they've all put their names in it .
i love papa more than anything in the whole world .
i'm going to marry papa .
isn't that funny?
i laughed when i saw it .
don't you think it's cold in here?
no , not particularly .
i have felt cold all my life .
mostly my stomach .
i wonder why .
you have low blood pressure .
let us have some tea , and we can sit and talk .
no , thank you , mother .
we won't disturb you any longer .
sigbritt's eldest boy will soon be 50 .
i thought of giving him father's gold watch .
it has no hands .
does that matter?
i remember when sigbritt's boy was a newborn .
he used to lie in the lilac arbor at the summer house .
now he's turning 50 .
and little cousin sara used to carry him around and sing to him .
she married sigfrid , that good for nothing .
well , you must go now , or you'll be late for the ceremony .
i am very glad you came , and i hope to seeyou again .
give my love to evald .
good bye .
where are anders and viktor?
they started arguing about god , and then they lost their tempers .
and anders tried to twist viktor's arm , and viktor said that was a lousy argument for god's existence .
i said they could talk about me instead .
then they told me to shut up because i didn't understand the debate , so i left .
they went up the hill to fight it out because each insisted ... the other had hurt his innermost feelings .
where are they now?
up there .
i'll see to them .
which one do you like best?
which one do you like best?
i don't know .
anders is going to be a minister
he's a darling .
but a minister's wife
viktor's nice too .
in a different way .
viktor will go far , of course .
what do you mean?
a doctor earns more money .
and ministers are out of date .
though he has got nice legs and a sweet neck .
but how can anyone believe in god?
well?
does god exist?
i dozed off , but was haunted by vivid and humiliating dreams .
there was something overpowering in these dream images that bored relentlessly into my mind .
haveyou looked in the mirror , isak?
then i'll show you what you look like .
you're a worried old man who's soon going to die , but i have all my life before me .
that hurt your feelings , after all .
no , it didn't hurt .
yes , it hurt because you can't bear the truth .
the truth is that i've been too considerate .
and so became unintentionally cruel .
i understand .
no , you don't understand .
we don't speak the same language .
look in the mirror again .
no , don't turn away .
i see .
listen to me .
i'm going to marry your brother sigfrid .
love is almost a game for us .
look at your face now .
try to smile !
there !
now you're smiling .
but it hurts so .
as professor emerit us , you ought to know why it hurts .
but you don't know .
you know so much , and you don't know anything .
i must go .
i promised to keep an eye on sigbritt's baby .
poor little thing .
hush , baby .
sleep .
don't be afraid of the wind or the birds or the waves of the sea .
i'm here with you , holding you tight .
don't be afraid , little one .
it will soon be day again .
no one will hurt you .
i am with you .
i am holding you .
please come in , professor borg .
have you brought your examination book?
please identify the bacterial specimen under the microscope .
there must be something wrong .
not with the microscope .
i can't see a thing .
please read this text .
what does it mean?
i don't know .
really?
i'm a doctor , not a linguist .
what you see on the blackboard is a doctor's first duty .
don't you know what that is?
let me think .
take your time .
a doctor's first duty
a doctor's
i've forgotten .
a doctor's first duty is to ask for forgiveness .
of course !
now i remember !
you have been accused of guilt .
i'll make a note that you haven't understood the charge .
is it serious?
unfortunately , professor .
i have a weak heart .
i'm an old man .
you must be lenient with me .
it's only fair .
there's nothing about your heart in my papers .
do you want to stop the examination?
no , for god's sake , no !
please diagnose the patient .
the patient is dead .
what are you writing in my book?
my verdict .
and that is?
that you are incompetent .
you are also accused of some minor but still serious offenses .
callousness , selfishness , ruthlessness .
your wife has made the charge .
you'll be confronted with her .
but myw ife has been dead for years !
do you think i'm joking?
please come with me .
you have no choice .
many forget a woman who has been dead for 30 years .
some cherish a sweet and fading picture , but you can recall this scene at any time .
tuesday , may 1 st , 1917 .
you stood on this very spot . and heard and saw what that man and woman said and did .
now i'll go home and tell isak .
i know just what he'll say .
my poor girl , i'm sorry for you .
just as if he were god .
then i'll weep and say , " do you really feel sorry for me?
he'll say , " yes , very sorry .
then i'll weep even more and ask him to forgive me .
he'll say ,
you mustn't beg my forgiveness .
there is nothing to forgive .
but he doesn't mean a word he says because he's cold as ice .
and suddenly he gets very tender , and i scream at him that he's mad and that his hypocrisy makes me sick .
then he says he'll get me a sedative and that he understands everything quite well .
and i tell him it's his fault that i am as i am .
and he looks sad and says it is his fault .
but he doesn't really care about anything because he's so cold .
where is she?
gone .
all are gone .
removed by an operation , professor .
a surgical masterpiece .
no pain .
nothing that bleeds or trembles .
how silent it is .
a perfect achievement in its way , professor .
and the punishment?
i don't know .
the usual , i suppose .
the usual?
loneliness .
loneliness?
precisely .
is there no mercy?
don't ask me .
i don't know .
what's this?
the children wanted to stretch their legs .
but it's still raining .
i told them about today and they want to honor you .
slept well?
yes , but recently i've had the weirdest dreams ,
as if i must tell myself something i won't listen to when i'm awake .
what's that?
that i'm dead .
although i'm alive .
you and evald are very alike .
so you've said .
he said the same thing .
about me?
no .
about himself .
but he's only 38 .
may i tell you about it?
yes , i'd be grateful .
a few months ago i wanted to talk to evald , so he drove me down to the sea .
it was raining then too .
he sat where you sit now .
well , you've trapped me .
what do you want to say?
something unpleasant , of course .
i wish i didn't have to .
you have found someone else .
don't be childish .
you tell me in funereal tones that you must talk to me , and then you find it hard to begin .
come on , for heaven's sake !
don't keep me on tenterhooks !
i almost want to laugh now .
whatever do you think i'm going to tell you?
that i've killed someone , or stolen the faculty funds?
i'm going to have a baby .
are you sure?
the doctor told me yesterday .
so that was the secret .
i might as well tell you that i intend to have this child .
you've made up your mind?
yes , i have .
you know i don't want a child .
you'll have to choose between me and the child .
poor evald .
don't " poor evald " me !
it's absurd to bring children into this world and think they'll be better off than we are .
that's just an excuse .
call it what you want .
i was an unwanted child in a hellish marriage .
is he even sure i'm his son?
that's no excuse for behaving like this .
i must be at the hospital at 3 : 00 .
i have neither the time nor the desire to discuss this any further .
you're a coward .
yes .
this life sickens me .
i will not be forced to take on a responsibility that will make me live for one day longer than i want to .
and you know that i mean what i say .
i know that this is wrong .
there's neither right nor wrong .
we act according to our needs .
and what are they?
yours is a hellish desire to live and to create life .
and yours?
mine is to be dead .
stone dead .
if you want to smoke a cigarette , i don't mind .
why have you told me all this?
i saw you with your mother , and i was panic stricken .
i don't understand .
that's his mother .
an old woman , cold as ice , more forbidding than death .
and this is her son , and there are light years between them .
he himself says he's a living corpse .
and evald is growing just as lonely , cold and dead .
and i thought of the baby inside me .
all along the line , there's nothing but cold and death and loneliness .
it must end somewhere .
but you're going back to evald !
to say i can't agree to his conditions .
i want this child .
no one can take it from me .
not even the man i love most ofall .
can i help you?
no one can help me .
we are too old .
things have gone too far .
what happened after your talk?
nothing .
i left him the next day .
hasn't he gotten in touch with you?
i don't want us to get  to get what?
like those two in the car today .
i was just thinking of them .
it reminded me of my own marriage .
but we love each other .
long may he live long may he live
may he live to be a hundred years old
we heard you're celebrating a grand occasion today .
with these simple flowers we want to say that we are very impressed that you've been a doctor for 50 years .
we know you must be a very wise old man who knows everything about life and has learned all the instructions by heart .
thank you .
now we must go on .
it's getting late .
so you did come .
evald and i had given up hope .
a nice drive is relaxing , isn't it?
you'll have to get into your tails at once .
good afternoon , marianne .
i've told evald you're coming .
thank you .
that was most kind .
so you came after all , miss agda .
i considered it my duty .
but my pleasure's been spoiled .
welcome , father .
as you see , i've brought marianne with me .
hello , marianne .
may i put my things upstairs?
the guest room as usual , father?
let me take your bag .
it's rather heavy .
did you have a good trip?
yes , it was pleasant .
who are those young people?
i don't know .
they're nice , and they're off to italy .
they seem nice .
yes , they're very nice .
it's a quarter past 4 : 00 .
i've bought you new shoelaces .
i'm leaving tomorrow , so don't worry .
areyou going to a hotel?
no , why?
can't we share the bedroom for one more night?
unless you object .
give me a hand unpacking?
it's nice to see you .
and unexpected .
same here .
are we going on to the banquet afterwards?
yes , i'll just call stenberg and tell him i'll have a lady with me .
hurry up , professor !
during the ceremony , my thoughts strayed to the day's events , and it was then i decided to write down what had happened .
in this jumble of events ,
i seemed to discern an extraordinary logic .
did you enjoy the ceremony?
yes , thank you .
areyou tired , miss agda?
i won't deny it .
take one of my sleeping pills .
miss agda , i am sorry about this morning .
are you ill , professor?
no .
why?
i don't like the sound of it .
is it so rare for me to say i'm sorry?
do you want the carafe on the table?
thank you anyway , professor .
good night .
miss agda , as we have known each other for so many years , don't you think we could call each other agda and isak?
no , i don't .
why not?
have you brushed your teeth , professor?
no intimacies for me , thank you .
it's all right between us as it is .
but we are old now .
speak for yourself .
a woman is jealous of her reputation .
what would people think if we suddenly began to say agda and isak?
they would make fun of us .
are you always right?
almost always .
at our age , we should know how to behave .
good night , professor .
i'll leave the door ajar .
you know where i am if you want anything .
father isak !
you were splendid in the procession .
we were terribly proud to know you .
an old girl is giving us a lift all the way to hamburg .
anders is mad about her .
oh , be quiet .
we just wanted to say good bye .
good bye .
and thank you for your company .
it's you i really love , you know .
today , tomorrow , always .
i'll remember .
come on .
we have to go now .
let me hear from you .
i think uncle is asleep .
evald !
yes , father?
areyou back already?
marianne lost the heel on a shoe .
so you're going to the dance?
i suppose so .
how are you , father?
excellent .
heart all right?
excellent .
sleep well .
sit down a moment .
anything special?
how is it to be between you and marianne?
forgive my asking .
i don't know .
it's not my business , but
but wouldn't it
i have asked her to stay with me .
shouldn't you i mean
i can't live without her .
you mean alone?
i can't live without her .
that's what i mean .
oh , i see .
it will be as she wants .
and she
she says she'll think about it .
about that debt of yours
don't worry , you'll get your money .
that's not what i meant .
how are you , uncle isak?
fine . just fine .
i lost a heel .
will these shoes do?
they're very nice .
thanks for coming with me .
i like you , marianne .
i like you too , uncle isak .
if i have been worried or sad during the day , it often calms me to recall childhood memories .
i did so on this evening too .
isak , there are no wild strawberries left .
auntie wants you to look for your papa .
we'll sail around and meet you at the other side of the island .
i can't find either papa or mama .
come , i'll help you .
