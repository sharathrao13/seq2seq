you're being investigated by the dsr .
they want to know why your picture's in the rambaldi book .
they've decoded some of the text .
and?
what did it say?
they're calling it " the prophecy .
vaughn !
pursuant to national security directive 81 a , you are in the custody of the government .
they broke the rambaldi code correctly .
so what does the prophecy say?
this woman here depicted will possess unseen marks , signs that she will be the one to bring forth my works .
bind them with fury .
a burning anger , unless prevented .
at vulgar cost , this woman will render the greatest power unto utter desolation .
it's vanilla .
milk shake .
will you do me a favor?
will you remind them that i cooperated?
that i didn't resist?
i don't need these restraints .
i'll tell them .
the dsr met with the fbl .
the dsr didn't tell me anything .
you're interagency liaison .
interagency liaison doesn't put me in the inner circle .
you and i don't work well together historically .
we've got this juvenile animosity thing going , and that's got to change .
let's just start over .
hi .
i don't know what they're planning to do to bristow .
if i were you , i'd let it go .
this buddy of mine at princeton knows haladki .
she used to see him eating lunch at the webster rotunda .
that guy's got the table manners of a 6 month old .
i'm gonna ask you a question .
i need you to be honest .
sure .
do you believe this thing , this prophecy?
you do , don't you?
no .
no , it's ridiculous .
but that picture looks just like her .
sydney's gonna take down the world?
but the dna sequence , the heart size .
they both match what rambaldi wrote .
i mean , either this thing is completely insane ...
or it isn't .
okay , what happened?
the fbl's involved?
there's an fbi tribunal flying in from d. c.
they're gonna question her and decide what the next move is .
ms. bristow , i'm special officer kendall , fbl .
ms. baker , mr. dunn .
you're being held under national security directive 81 a.
per the directive , we can legally file formal charges against you based on current evidence .
we would appreciate cooperation in answering questions .
if you choose legal counsel , this meeting is canceled .
we'll determine the charges based on current evidence .
it's your decision .
i have nothing to hide .
please state your name and occupation .
sydney bristow .
i'm an intelligence officer for the united states government .
under which agency?
cla .
how did you come to work with the cla?
don't you already have a file on me?
we would like this in your words .
i came to work with the cla through my involvement with sd 6 .
and how did you get involved with sd 6?
i was a student .
a freshman at college .
one day , a man came to me .
he said he worked with u. s. intelligence and that they wanted to interview me .
and you agreed .
no .
no , not at first .
it was the last thing that i was interested in , working for the u. s. government .
despite that , i found myself wondering if i could actually become a spy .
you believed that you could?
sort of , which is crazy .
i didn't even realize what being a spy meant .
the truth is ,
i didn't love any of the subjects i was studying .
my father and i weren't speaking .
my mother had died .
the highlight of my social life was my dorm's salad bar .
so i called them .
sd 6 .
they didn't use that name .
these men led me to believe they were cla .
they were very convincing ... are very convincing .
so you met with an organization that you believed was the cla?
yes .
they had me sign about 500 nondisclosure agreements , and they offered me a job .
just like that?
they had me take a job as an office assistant on the 20th floor of a corporate bank downtown .
i just assumed that the bank was somehow affiliated with the cla .
they told me they would be watching me .
this was the evaluation phase .
that lasted for six months .
the transition?
eight months of training , tests , and propaganda .
before that , i had never fired a gun .
i had never thrown a punch .
it was during the transition i first heard the term sd 6 .
and at this time , you believed that sd 6 was affiliated with the cla?
yes , that it was a black ops division of the cla .
meaning ...
you mean , what is black ops?
a division that is funded by the cla's black budget .
operations that are highly classified .
even hidden from congressional oversight .
they led me to believe sd 6 was one of these divisions and that was why they didn't operate through langley .
you never questioned that logic?
as i said before , mr. kendall , they were very convincing .
now , i might not have been a genius at 19 years old , but i was smart enough to know what questions to ask .
they had all the right answers .
says here you were a genius .
and how did the transition end?
they made reference to the sd 6 headquarters .
they told me they'd take me there .
what i didn't realize was that getting there would only require a ride in the elevator .
the office of sd 6 is located on sublevel 6 of the credit dauphine building .
the first time i walked through there , surrounded by strangers who i thought were working for the good of the country ,
i felt wildly patriotic .
and then i met arvin sloane .
so you're sydney bristow .
yes , sir .
nice to meet you .
i'm arvin sloane .
welcome to sd 6 .
what happens if i need to go to the bathroom?
i think we can arrange that .
anything?
my fbi contacts don't have access to sydney's case .
what about devlin?
they're not giving him clearance .
all we know is that sydney's being held locally , and we've got to find out where she is .
it's how long she's in custody that concerns me .
sloane wants a meeting with sydney tuesday morning .
maybe the fbi won't put as much credence in rambaldi's prophecy as dsr .
that's a miscalculation .
in the current climate , the fbl's being wildly vigilant .
if another government agency red flags someone as a potential security threat , the fbi won't be so quick to let them go .
sydney could be held long enough to blow her cover at sd 6?
under directive 81 a , they could conceivably hold her without trial or charges for the rest of her life .
describe your role within sd 6 .
desk work at first , but i advanced quickly .
the first year , i was being sent out on reconnaissance missions .
the whole time , believing that you were working for the cla?
with the exception of a half dozen high level officers , the entire office believes they work for the cla .
and you remained in school during all of this .
why?
did sd 6 want you to?
actually , they didn't want me to .
it was something i wanted to do .
become a teacher .
i didn't want to give that up .
who is daniel hecht?
danny was my fianc .
could you tell us what happened to him , please?
build me up  buttercup , baby  then you bring me down  and mess me around , and then , worst of all  you never call , baby , when you say you will
we had been together two years when danny proposed . don't break my heart
i had never told anyone about my involvement with sd 6 .
but i knew that if i was gonna marry danny ... he had to know the truth .
so i told him that i was a spy .
while i was in taipei on an operation ,
sd 6 had him killed .
so , sd 6 murdered your fianc?
yes , they did .
and that didn't seem extreme to you?
i don't understand your question .
we're trying to determine how a girl as brilliant as yourself could believe an agency that could order the assassination of an innocent civilian could actually be affiliated with the u. s. government .
you're suggesting that i knew what sd 6 really was all along .
you claim to have learned the truth about sd 6 when?
it wasn't a claim .
it was the truth .
after danny ...
i refused to return to sd 6 , which they saw as a betrayal .
that's when they came after me .
it was that night that i learned that my father ... who i was never very close to ... was also an officer with sd 6 .
get in .
daddy?
and i learned who i was really working for .
about a decade ago , a pool of agents went freelance .
the alliance of 12 .
they're an enemy of the united states .
i'm one of them .
sd 6 is not a black ops division of the cla .
sd 6 is a branch of the alliance .
you work for the enemy you thought you were fighting .
that's impossible .
that was the first time i heard the truth about sd 6 .
the first time .
make sure susan gets donaldson's briefing .
call josh .
tell him i'm gonna have to cancel lunch .
what'd you say before about haladki?
i don't think he showers .
about your friend .
she used to see him at lunch .
at the webster rotunda .
at the adams federal building?
why?
you're not allowed in the rotunda unless you're a ranking fbi officer .
no way .
hey , you know what?
excuse me .
before you joined the agency , you were with the bureau .
my history with the fbi is right on my rsum .
you know exactly what fbi protocol is , and you know where sydney's being held .
you have lost your mind .
you're the one on the witch hunt .
look , we decoded 47 distinct and verifiable rambaldi predictions .
the guy hasn't been wrong once .
where is she?
what if he's not wrong about this one?
what if sydney bristow is a threat?
what if rambaldi got it right?
what did they tell you was the objective of sd 6?
the retrieval and study of intelligence , both military and industrial , throughout the world , that is critical to the superiority and survival of the united states of america .
it's the company line .
well , what does " sd " stand for?
section desparu .
the section that doesn't exist .
alain christophe , one of the alliance founders .
the term was his .
explain to us about the alliance of 12 .
the alliance is like a board of directors .
some are from the private sector .
most are former intelligence officers .
all wealthy .
they started a company together , except this company , the alliance , trades intelligence .
so you're saying they're after ...
weapons , military secrets , industrial intel , medical tech , computer advances , political agendas .
anything the other guy wants .
the other guy being?
governments , corporations , wealthy citizens , families .
it's all black market .
it's organized crime .
could you give me an example?
do you remember the carbon proxy disaster in '92?
an accidental methyl isocyanate leak at the manufacturing plant in bangalore , india .
killed 3, 000 people .
another 1, 000 disabled .
1996 , near kyoto , japan .
bullet train accidentally switched tracks and derailed .
150 people were killed .
last year in germany .
a transport plane suffered mechanical failure outside munich .
12 lives were lost .
none of them were accidents .
some were acts of revenge .
others were personal favors to those who helped to fund the alliance .
some were distractions , so local resources were occupied so that sd 4 or sd 7 could infiltrate a building somewhere and retrieve sensitive data .
go on .
after what they did to danny , what they tried to do to me ,
i swore i'd destroy them .
sd 6 .
but first , i had to win back their confidence , so i stole something that i knew arvin sloane wanted .
a device based on the design by milo rambaldi .
i'm back .
then i went to the people that i thought i'd been working for all along .
that's where i met my handler , michael vaughn .
i thought the job would be over by christmas .
it was vaughn who made it clear to me what i was really up against .
so that's how i became a double agent .
and a few days later , your father came to see you and revealed that he was a double agent working for the cla .
that his job at sd 6 was cover , too .
yes , that's right .
father and daughter double agents .
yes .
why would he recruit his daughter into that environment?
he wouldn't .
he didn't .
arvin sloane was a friend of my parents .
it was sloane's idea to bring me in .
he didn't tell my father until after i was active .
why did sloane go after you?
i don't know .
you're sure sloane brought you into sd 6 , not your father?
why do you ask?
your father's allegiance has always been with the cla .
now , listen to me .
i have been very patient .
i've put up with implications that i'm not to be trusted .
but i will not accept you insulting my father .
that is unacceptable .
it was just a question .
it was an accusation .
you are questioning my honor , my loyalty .
based on a prophecy written in a book that you wouldn't have if it weren't for me .
i think we should take a break .
i want to finish this .
i want to get out of here .
no , sit down !
listen to me !
i want to go home !
wait a minute !
okay , here we go .
look at this .
rocking the cradle .
yes .
unless prevented at vulgar cost , this woman will render the greatest power unto utter desolation .
you gotta stop reading that .
what's " vulgar cost "?
michael , i don't know .
this woman without pretense will have had her effect , never having seen the beauty of my sky behind mt .
subasio .
perhaps a single glance would have quelled her fire .
never having seen the beauty of my sky behind mt .
subasio .
that's where rambaldi was born .
why don't we all go to mt .
subasio?
all right , here we go .
around the world .
what?
what just happened?
thanks for coming .
i checked out security section .
they have nothing on sydney .
look at this .
this woman will have had her effect never having seen the beauty of mt .
subasio .
if the fbi is gonna take this so literally , then every phrase must have equal veracity .
according to rambaldi , the subject of this prophecy will have never seen mt .
subasio .
meaning if sydney were to go there and see it ...
she couldn't be the woman rambaldi was talking about .
it's good , it's good .
devlin put three calls in to the fbi director .
he was stonewalled .
the fbl's not in the most cooperative mood .
we'll have to extract her .
get her to italy ourselves .
i know devlin would sanction transit .
we can have a jet in an hour .
the question is how to find her .
steven haladki .
he works in the l. a. office .
former fbl .
he still has ties .
haladki .
i'll talk to him .
he's not talking .
he'll talk to me .
when we left off , we were chatting about your father .
what can you tell me about your mother?
for most of my life ,
i thought that she was a literature professor at ucla .
i thought that she was a loving mother and an adoring wife .
apparently , i couldn't have been more wrong .
could you elaborate?
a few months ago , i noticed something unusual .
i found cyrillic codes in old books that my father had purchased .
i began to suspect him of having collaborated with the kgb .
but that wasn't the case , was it?
no .
those cyrillic codes you found in those books .
yes , they were orders from the kgb .
and , yes , they were orders to kill .
an agent received those orders and carried them out .
but , sydney , i was not that agent .
your mother was .
your mother was a traitor .
yes .
a woman who appeared to be one thing , but actually was another .
your mother .
tell me how she died .
i ...
i used to think my mother and father were driving together .
i was wrong .
my mother was actually alone .
she was being pursued by an fbi counterintelligence officer .
the roads were slippery .
there was an accident .
the cars went into the river .
after she died , your father raised you .
is that right?
no .
he hired a nanny .
like i said , he and i didn't have much of a relationship until recently .
so , like your father , you're a double agent .
tell us how that works .
it always begins with something that sd 6 wants .
information , technology , classified data .
typically , sloane outlines the mission objective , then marshall reviews the tech .
marshall?
he's our tech guy .
this looks like just a normal phone .
hi , i'm gonna be late for dinner , dad .
don't wait up for me .
biometric sensor .
what it does is ...
barely touch it , and you are knocked out cold .
like freebasing thorazine .
boom , you're out .
now , this looks just like a normal purse that you would wear at the beach putting in your ... but it is a parabolic microphone .
not only do they take pictures silently , but they're super swank .
once i have the mission laid out , i contact the cla .
i detail the sd 6 operation on a brown paper bag and wait for the cla to contact me .
after the cla reviews the mission , what happens then?
i meet vaughn to get my countermission .
and could you give us an example of a countermission?
sd 6 sends me to moscow to get computer disks .
the cla wants copies .
i'm in the bar .
i can see you .
are those the files?
if they are , cough .
get ready to make a switch .
after i get back to los angeles , i have to complete a brush pass .
i give the stolen disks to vaughn so that the cla can make copies .
before i leave the airport , vaughn passes the originals back so i can deliver them to sloane ... ... all without my sd 6 partner knowing .
your sd 6 partner?
dixon .
dixon believes that sd 6 is affiliated with the cla .
he doesn't know you're a double?
that's right .
does that ever cause problems?
sd 6 sent us to retrieve a vaccine from a plant in badenweiler and destroy the empty building .
while i was in the laboratory ,
dixon was setting the explosive charge .
what dixon didn't know , what i couldn't tell him , was that the cla also had a team in that building .
i've got a bomb to disengage .
we'd appreciate it .
my cla countermission included disarming dixon's bomb .
did you get the inhalers?
we're good .
i knew dixon's detonator wouldn't work .
that was the plan .
come on .
we gotta go .
i brought a secondary detonator in case there was a frequency jam .
let's go .
can we take a break , please?
just for a minute?
i have no desire to blow your head off , but i will unless you tell me where sydney bristow is .
the federal building on moorpark .
what's the plan?
there's a safe house half a mile away .
when are they transferring her?
what time?
5 : 30 .
that was the plan .
just so we're clear .
you report this conversation , and you'll never wear a hat again .
i got it .
no worries .
i got it .
we need a list of people who are aware of your double agent status .
it's a short list .
besides the cla , only my father knows .
you've never told anyone else?
no .
after what happened to danny ,
i thought it might be a good idea to keep my mouth shut .
i'm gonna call the bank .
i'm gonna quit for you .
my job might seem pointless and stupid , but it's not .
and if you even knew what i dealt with every day , you might thank me for doing my job so well .
what the hell are you talking about?
nothing .
i'm going to work .
you have a hard time keeping secrets?
no , i don't have a hard time keeping a secret .
what i don't enjoy is lying to my friends or being in a constant state of jet lag from flying to far corners of the world for a man that i wish were dead .
sloane .
yes , sloane .
how often does sd 6 send you on operations?
tell me why we're all gluttons for pain  the girl is totally insane  she doesn't know the meaning of tame  still , i can't put out the flame  hey , hey , i wanna play  on the team that you despise  every day , a new disguise  every night , a halloween  she says , " keep the motor runnin ', man "  like i was some machine  and you can talk , talk , but i'm keeping her stock  i wouldn't even change a thing  why fight?  you've got me roped and tied  i hit your baited line , i'm so diggin 'your scene  i said you're playin 'with my head  i could split instead , i'm so diggin 'your scene
i keep busy .
what does sd 6 want?
what is their priority?
at the moment , it's rambaldi .
what can you tell me about him?
milo rambaldi was pope alexander vl's chief architect .
he was an artist and inventor .
his designs were so technologically advanced that , at the time , they thought he was a heretic , and he was executed .
now , 500 years later , many believe he was a prophet .
and sd 6 , cla , gru , k directorate .
the entire intelligence world is on a rambaldi scavenger hunt .
why?
they assume that rambaldi had some sort of master plan , which was recently confirmed following my trip to argentina .
in that book ,
rambaldi refers to a single construction .
the agencies don't know what it is yet , but they're all afraid the other guy's gonna get it first .
i just have one more question .
do you believe rambaldi was a prophet?
do you?
you're not gonna let me go , are you?
we're done for today .
don't move !
get down !
down !
on the ground !
don't move !
you !
come with us !
go , go !
go , go !
we've got a silver van , california license plate 4 ...
you're gonna be okay .
what the hell are you doing?
proving this prophecy is not about you .
we'll explain everything when we get there .
dad?
hey , honey .
if the fbi takes this prophecy seriously , the key to your innocence will be in the second paragraph .
rambaldi wrote that the woman in that picture will have never seen mt .
subasio .
the fbi would have kept you in custody for months .
sd 6 would have investigated and found out the truth .
going to mt .
subasio should give them the proof they need .
the fbi might have let me go .
this makes them certain i'm guilty .
escaping from federal custody and crossing the border proves that i've acted in opposition to the government .
it was either do nothing and get killed by sd 6 or take a risk to protect your cover .
i'm a fugitive from justice .
not for long .
once you get to italy , we'll alert all agencies of our actions and your location .
they'll extract you , and you'll no longer be a suspect .
you don't know that .
we will have protected a vital cla asset .
you .
fbl's not gonna want to make a big deal out of this .
they can't afford the press .
i'm gonna take you to the jet .
you have to get in the trunk .
what if the fbi was right?
what if rambaldi was right?
what if he was talking about me?
then everything's predetermined .
nothing we do makes any difference .
if rambaldi's right , there's nothing to lose .
seriously , guys , cops are everywhere .
when you get to italy , contact me .
so we can speak .
alan , it's steven .
i need to tell you something that happened today .
no , i'm not okay , actually .
i did a stupid thing , and i'll take full responsibility for it .
jack bristow came to see me earlier .
i told him about sydney's transfer time .
when?
are you all right?
you didn't think about it , not once , the possibility that rambaldi could be right about me .
no , i didn't .
why not?
i believe in you .
did you think i'd just throw anyone in my trunk?
i just checked with transportation .
four vehicles were taken out .
i have their makes and license plates .
you're gonna take that car to dozer field .
there's a jet waiting to take you to italy .
be careful .
you too .
the lapd is in pursuit ...
every day there's another one of these .
they're so stupid .
why doesn't the guy just give up?
it's not like he can escape .
he's stupid .
switch your engine off now !
look at that guy .
this is the part where he gets out of his car and surrenders .
turn off the engine and step away from the vehicle now !
get your hands up !
get your hands where we can see them !
oh , my god .
it's me .
sydney , where are you?
i need to see you now .
what happened to you?
that plane is ready to take you to italy .
you need to go now .
i know .
but i needed to see you first .
dad , i just drove a car into the ocean .
i knew the police were waiting for me .
i used the air from the tires .
i was underwater for 10 minutes before i started to swim .
and as that car started to fill with water ,
i knew what my mother had done in the same situation .
dad , she could have planned that accident .
it makes sense .
she was deceitful .
she was cruel , ruthless .
and in rambaldi's prophecy he uses details ,
like that dna sequencing .
dad , i inherited that .
i mean , it's either mom or me .
i know it's not me .
mom's alive .
i know it .
