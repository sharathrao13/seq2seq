pull .
pull harder .
pull harder .
come on .
that's it .
i'm done .
madam !
i'm coming .
madam .
here i am .
what can i do for you , sir?
i heard you have a new girl .
you're well informed .
is she pretty?
she's quite a beauty .
bring her to me .
there is one thing you need to know .
what's that?
the girl is blind .
blind?
then she must be special .
i'm curious .
how did you lose your sight?
i was born blind .
why would a blind girl work here?
why can't a blind girl work here?
you're right .
what's your name?
xiao mei .
xiao mei?
every girl here is named after a flower .
why is yours so plain?
i don't want to compete with those girls .
what do you mean?
the flowers here can hardly be called flowers .
real flowers bloom in the wilderness .
well said .
if you impress me
i'll take you to where the real flowers grow .
what's your talent as the top showgirl?
dancing .
come closer .
don't you know the rule?
a rare beauty in the north .
she's the finest lady on earth .
a glance from her , the whole city goes down .
a second glance leaves the nation in ruins .
there exists no city or nation that has been more cherished than a beauty like this .
a rare beauty in the north .
she's the finest lady on earth .
a glance from her , the whole city goes down .
a second glance leves the nation in ruins .
there exists no city or nation that has been more cherished than a beauty like this .
please calm down , sir .
go away .
what's the matter .
please let me explain .
the girl is young and inexperienced .
please forgive her .
take her away .
go away .
take her away .
stop !
captain .
this is the captain of the county .
to hell with the captain !
outrageous !
arrest him .
let me go .
who are you?
how dare you !
i'm the captain .
you're drunk and indecently dressed .
arrest both of them .
get your hands off me .
let me go .
please spare the girl , captain .
that man was drunk .
it was not her fault .
please don't arrest her .
our business is new .
i rely on her to bring in guests .
how can a blind girl be a top showgirl?
move !
she's a dancer with rare skills .
please see for yourself .
do you know the " echo game "?
i played it once .
all right .
perform well and i'll let you go .
thank you , captain .
go and change quickly .
who are you really?
why do you want to kill me?
government running dogs ...
i wish to kill all of you .
i do enjoy fighting a blind girl .
we found this in her room .
you're a member of the " flying daggers " .
who's the new leader?
where's the new leader?
i'll show you what we'll do if you don't answer .
show her !
in front of you is a torture device .
your head will be put here .
your shoulder , here .
your back , here .
your legs here .
you'll never dance again after this .
do you understand?
you have one day to think it over .
the girl reminds me of someone .
who?
rumor has it , the old leader's blind daughter disappeared after his death .
it was a heavy blow to the " flying daggers " .
they vowed revenge for their loss , while searching for the girl .
why would the old leaders daughter end up in a brothel?
who owns the peony pavilion?
perhaps the " flying daggers " has realized we were responsible for their old leader's death .
forget it .
let's turn her over for a reward and then go out for a drink .
i have a better idea .
since we have some clues ,
let's follow them through for a bigger reward .
do you want me to do it?
of course , who else?
all right .
the girl is a rare beauty .
you know i love flirting with girls .
don't let beauty blind your judgment .
if i die under a skirt , i can still flirt as a ghost .
who are you?
i undressed you only yesterday .
why did you rescue me?
why do you think?
you're an exquisite flower .
i'll do anything to help you .
control yourself .
don't worry .
i'm no longer a guest of the peony pavilion .
you're not a showgirl anymore .
you're the daughter of the old leader .
what did you say?
how many blind girls know martial arts and carry daggers like these?
i've rescued you , and your daggers as well .
why did you take such a risk?
i hate the corrupt government . and admire the " flying daggers " .
much obliged .
why did we abandon the horses?
hoof prints can be easily tracked .
i have two new horses hidden ahead .
you've planned well .
what's your name , master?
just call me wind .
wind?
i wander around all alone , come and go without a trace .
like a carefree wind?
no , a playful wind .
you like to tease .
i wonder what you look like?
that's easy to find out .
here .
please let go .
this isn't the peony pavilion .
no rules here .
you know what i look like if you touch my face .
come on .
it's not respectful to touch your face first .
you prefer to start at the bottom .
that's fine with me .
you've mastered the flying technique .
your right hand is skilled with a machete .
your left hand is powerful with a bow and arrow .
your heart beats steadily , you seem sincere .
you can read me like a book .
you're a brave man .
i'm never shy around women .
you're young , indeed .
you know how to hold your drink .
the soldiers are approaching .
i've lost my dagger pouch .
i'm sorry i was late .
the " flying daggers " are always moving .
where should we go?
we just keep heading north .
just head north?
they will come to us .
the " flying daggers " has many masters .
why did they send you as an assassin?
no one sent me , i came alone .
as the old leader's daughter , you should be more cautious .
have you considered the consequences?
i'll do anything to avenge my father .
these are men's clothes .
put them on for now .
i won't take advantage of you .
have you seen enough?
please hand me the clothes .
you know i was here?
master wind wanders like the wind .
i'd expect you to be anywhere .
you look different in men's clothes .
do i look awful?
i will tell all the girls to wear men's clothes , the next time i visit the peony pavilion .
now i know you're not shy around women .
you're not shy either .
how do you know?
you knew i was watching you bathe , yet you said nothing .
you saved my life .
you can look all you please .
i thought you were hot as fire .
in fact , you're cool as water .
i don't know you well enough .
i really care for you .
a playboy like you , are you ever for real?
what if i am this time?
are your men close by?
i'm sure today's fighting has fooled mei .
our men will ease off from now on .
good .
that'll save me some arrows .
any clues?
not yet .
don't let her see through you .
don't worry .
i never fail at seducing a woman .
she trusts me .
i warn you , don't fall for her .
what do you mean fall?
fall into bed?
like her father she must be very cunning .
don't let her fool you .
don't be absurd .
i'm in control .
i have to get back now .
don't turn a game into reality and ruin our plan .
who cares , as long as the plan works .
shall we rest for a while?
i smell flowers .
you told me you'd bring me to where real flowers grow .
which is the most beautiful?
how do i look?
pretty as a flower .
soldiers are approaching .
i'm on your side .
you?
i'm a captain of the county .
a captain?
nonsense .
you are the bastard who broke the jail .
you're wounded .
is it serious?
no .
was it someone from the " flying daggers "?
it's not likely .
then who?
i don't know .
he's gone .
i guess he doesn't want to reveal himself .
this time , i believe you're for real .
you've done enough for me .
please leave .
don't worry about me .
we've come this far , i can't leave you now .
i hope you're not seriously wounded .
we agreed there would be no more fights .
why did government soldiers turn up?
the general sent them .
they don't know you .
the general?
how did the general get involved?
this case is important .
i had to report it .
the general is taking over .
the soldiers didn't have to be that aggresive .
the general ordered it .
he said we need real blood to draw " flying daggers " out .
even if the blood is mine?
jin , the soldiers lives and our lives are worth nothing to him .
you don't know how i felt as i killed our own men .
i feel worse .
i am tortured .
you?
i truly regret taking on this mission .
i've followed you all the way .
endured many sleepless nights .
my heart grows heavy when i htink about what lies ahead .
is there no other way to do this?
it's the only way to expose the " flying daggers " .
jin , you should know , there are more soldiers ahead .
what?
the general sent them .
they don't know you either .
you must stop them .
there is nothing i can do .
the order given to these soldiers is " fight to kill " .
if you don't kill them they will kill you .
take care .
i quit !
where have you been?
i have a question for you .
what question?
are you for real?
what do you mean?
do you feel anything for me?
don't take this too seriously .
i want to know .
i'm a free spirit ,
like the wind , always moving .
the wind never thinks too much .
i want the wind to stop and think .
the wind cannot stop .
not even for me?
the wind breezes through without a trace .
now you understand why i'm called wind .
fine , go and be the wind .
i don't need you anymore !
i don't care if you're true or not ,
i have to leave .
i want to end this .
are you going alone?
i'd like to be the wind for once .
where will you go?
who knows .
whichever way the wind blows .
aren't you going back to the " flying daggers "?
do you want me to go back?
i've left them , why would i return?
thank you for all you've done for me .
it's you .
go .
you said the wind could not stop .
a playful wind stops at will .
you shouldn't have come back .
i came back , for you .
nia !
xiao mei , you're back .
who will believe the madam of peony pavilion is the leader of the " flying daggers " !
i behaved badly that day .
please forgive me .
did i look like a real madam?
very much so .
what do you think of mei?
what do you mean?
i mean her personality of course .
she's passionate .
go on .
she may be blind , but she's very bright .
hardly anyone can match her .
not even i.
do you care for her?
you are asking?
a man and a girl travelling all alone , what else could i be talking about?
mei is a rare beauty .
i care for her a lot .
then , i shall act as the matchmaker for you two to marry .
marriage is a big deal .
this is too sudden .
she's not a good match for you?
on the contrary .
mei is from respectable family .
i'm just a humble swordsman .
our old leader loved his daughter dearly .
now i've become the new leader , it's my duty to find her a good husband .
i haven't been able to find anyone within the " flying daggers " who would be a better choice than you .
what do you say?
i accept your offer .
our house is obliged to you .
you've done us a great favour .
please accept my gratitude .
with much pleasure .
what is going on?
where are our soldiers?
they were ambushed .
you were both plotting to catch me by following mei .
you're not blind?
are you the old leader's daughter?
he has a blind daughter .
she doesn't know martial arts , so i pretend to be her .
if you had known the thruth , would you have followed her here?
it's been all an act .
who are you really?
my name is xiao mei .
i'm just one of many girls in the house of flying daggers .
that's enough .
take him out .
you wait here .
i want to finish him off myself .
move .
stop .
do you have anything to say?
you're not nia , the new leader .
you're right .
of course i'm not nia .
nia wouldn't show herself so easily .
who are you then?
that is not important .
nia sent me to finish this matter .
you've done a good job , leo .
we've never met before , but i know you by reputation .
three years ago , we planted you as a mole in the government .
you've accomplished much in that role .
i failed to protect our old leader from being assassinated .
nia knew you were away on duty .
there was nothing you could do .
i'm grateful for her understanding .
we need to win this battle against the government troops .
you and mei have succsessfully set up a trap for the general .
well done .
i'll report to nia and have you rewarded .
it's my duty .
please tell nia the general has led all his best soldiers towards us .
be careful .
don't worry .
nia has a good plan .
there is one thing i don't understand .
what's that?
who sent mei on this mission?
nia did .
has nia ever considered my feelings?
what do you mean?
i haven't seen mei for three years .
now i have to watch her flirt with another man .
it's not the first time
mei's used her beauty to aid our cause .
i've heard about your feelings for her .
do you still love her?
we're facing a battle that will decide the fate of the " flying daggers " .
the troops are closing in .
this is not the time for love .
all right .
i will let you see mei .
you haven't changed .
i'm still mei .
it's been three years .
finally , we are alone together .
i know .
you saved me during the battle with the soldiers .
thank you .
you don't need to thank me .
i would do anything for you .
i know .
you've risked everything going undercover to win honour and to impress me .
you're the only one who understands me .
i was all alone for three years .
you were in my mind every single moment .
my love for you was all i had to keep me going .
do you love him?
you know the plan .
it was only an act between you and him .
there is no future for you two .
do you understand?
nia !
you can't force a woman against her will .
do not pull this dagger out .
i'm sending you back to keep spying for us .
you will be more convincing with a dagger in your back .
you must leave immediately .
yes , ma'am .
i have sacrificed three years for you .
how could you love jin after just three days?
mei , i also have a task for you .
jin is of no use for us anymore .
take him out and kill him .
leo plays a crucial role for us .
we can't let jin ruin our plan .
you must kill him to prevent any future trouble .
you know our rules .
yes , ma'am .
i left you in order to save your life , but you still followed me .
please don't blame me .
if your plan succeded many in the " flying daggers " would die .
you wouldn't let me go either .
it would be on my knees , waiting to die .
you're right .
if i won ,
i wouldn't let you go .
go .
how will you explain this to nia?
that's my business .
why don't you come with me?
deep in your heart , you have a secret .
i guess there is a man you find hard to leave behind .
yes , a man who's saved my life many times .
was it he who helped us in the last battle?
yes .
then he has saved my life too .
do you still love him?
when can we see each other again?
we cannot .
we belong to two opposite forces .
if we meet again , one of us will have to die .
a decisive battle is imminent .
you and i are just pawns on a chessboard .
nobody cares if we live or die .
let's go away together and roam the world , as free as the wind .
we'll wander around alone .
come and go without a trace ,
like a playful wind .
no , a carefree wind .
just you and me .
come with me , please .
are you going with him?
why?
you're the love of my life .
you don't have to love me , but you can never go with him .
otherwise you'll die .
mei ,
you've forced me to kill you .
i knew you would do this .
you knew and you went away .
why?
why did you go?
why did you go?
why?
to be free ... like the wind .
mei !
mei .
turn ...
what?
turn ...
turn around?
look behind you .
you're a member of the " flying daggers " .
you're right .
you're the one who loves mei?
yes , i love her truly , while you are only playing a game .
if you love her , why kill her?
it's all your fault .
my fault?
i warned you but you wouldn't listen .
she has betrayed me because of you .
you must die !
fine .
you kill mei , you must die too !
mei .
let him go .
if you kill him ,
i'll kill you with this dagger .
mei , don't pull the dagger out !
if you do your blood will drain and you will die .
you must not do it !
mei .
i'm closer to him .
he will hit me first .
you cannot save me with your dagger .
mei !
you shouldn't have come back ...
i came back for you , my love ...
