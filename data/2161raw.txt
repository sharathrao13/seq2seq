okay , we'll see you inside the murder ride , we'll be back .
bye .
ladies and gentlemen , boys and girls , children of all ages , you are about to enter the world of darkness , a world where life and death are meaningless , and pain is god .
pain !
billy , let's go .
quit that , sport .
sorry , captain spaulding .
we gonna have a good time now .
on your right , you will see the infamous albert ...
fish .
masochist , sadist , child killer and most importantly , cannibal .
mr. fish , born 1870 and enjoyed spankings with nail studded paddles , stuffing needles deep into his groin .
i have a question .
how many  hold all questions .
no , no , help .
lizzie fucking borden .
now , one of our most famous crazies , the psycho of plainsfield , mr. ed gein .
murderer , cannibal ,
mr. gein used to take great pleasure of playing with dead bodies of women , especially , their sexual organs .
now , one of our local heroes ,
s. quentin quale , aka dr. satan .
oh shit !
murderer , torturer , but most of all , master surgeon .
mr. quail was an intern at willows county mental hospital , nicknamed weeping willows for the neverending cries of pain .
through primitive brain surgery
jerry , stop it .
mr. quail believed that he could create a race of superhumans from the mentally ill .
vigilante justice prevailed .
they took his ass out and hung him .
and that infamous hanging tree is no more than a stone's throw away from where y'alls 'ass is now seated .
but the next day his body was found to be missing .
until today no trace of dr. satan has ever been discovered .
but then , who knows?
maybe he lives next door to you .
tour's over .
exit through the doors .
that was so bad ass .
dr. satan .
ah hhh , dr. satan .
maybe he lives next door to you .
calm down , it was all right .
do you think maybe we could go now?
i'm gonna go call my dad .
i'll be right back .
i love you .
what do you mean , it was all right?
it was cool , but it wasn't that great .
dude , you don't have to play it down in front of your chick .
oh .
thank you .
don't move a muscle , an artery ,  or a vein .
hello?
hey , dad .
wow , denise .
we stopped for gas at this place called captain spaulding's , somewhere outside of ruggsville .
it turned into this whole big thing , so we're behind schedule .
don't be too late .
i forgot to tell you that halloween falls on a school night so they're trick or treating tonight .
your left hand shows your past ; your right hand shows your future .
good evening .
i'm lance brockwell and this is the 7 : 00 news .
and our top story tonight , investigators still have no leads to the strange disappearance of the five cheerleaders from ruggsville high school .
cindy thompson , karen murphy ,
allison cole , valarie green , and dawn baker were last seen four days ago leaving a football game .
i know it seems stupid , but i really wanna see this tree .
do yourself a favor , son , just forget about it .
oh , come on , i live for this shit .
okay , all right , i'll draw you a damn map .
thank you .
i still say it's a waste of time .
you are here .
go straight up this road .
make the first right .
first left .
come straight across and down .
can't find it?
tough .
here's your map .
right on .
here's your complimentary chicken .
oh , wow .
don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out .
you're gonna get a great write up for this .
here's an idea , let's just skip it .
it's probably nothing anyway .
christ , jerry , bill is right , we can't see anything .
what's that?
hitchhiker .
what?
should we stop?
we can't leave her in the rain .
stick her in the front if you wanna pick her up so bad .
so , uh ,
where ya headed?
i was just going home .
home , where's that?
a couple miles up the road .
so , you live around here?
yeah .
do you know where this dr. satan tree's at?
yeah .
you know where that's at?
it's right by my house .
i can show you .
really?
so , it is a real thing .
fuck you .
so , a tree?
where's it at?
what tree?
okay , this is crazy .
she obviously doesn't know anything .
oh , i know , i'll show you where it's at .
whatever you need to do , you do it .
there is no wrong .
lf someone needs to be killed , you kill 'em .
that's the way .
fuck .
i think we blew a tire .
oh poop .
oh , hell .
at least we got that spare .
you filled it up like i asked , right?
yeah , yeah .
okay , what if i forgot to put it back in the trunk?
what would plan b entail?
jesus christ , jerry .
technically i did what you said .
oh for fucking sake , jerry , what're we gonna do now?
i can't rightly say if i know , me ladies .
wait , i love this song .
would you turn the radio off , please? !
god !
we can walk to my house from here .
what?
my brother's got a tow truck .
he can come get your car .
i'll go , it's my fault .
forget it , i'm going .
no , bill , l  you guys stay here .
there's no sense in everyone getting drenched .
returning to the news , local authorities still have no lead in the mysterious disappearance of the five cheerleaders from ruggsville .
the girls were last seen
leaving a cheering competition ...
actor # 1 : ... lt was loud enough to wake the dead .
that's an idea .
what is?
wouldn't it be dramatic?
supposing the people inside were dead , all stretched out with the lights quietly burning about them .
i'm sure it would be very amusing .
why you ask?
why is not the question .
how?
now , that is a question worth examining .
how could i , being born of such conventional stock , arrive a leader of the rebellion?
an escapist from a conformist world , destined to find happiness only in that which cannot be explained .
i brought you here for a reason .
but unfortunately , you and your sentimental minds are doing me no good .
my brain is frozen ,
locked .
i have to break free from this culture of mechanical reproductions and the thick incrustations dying on the surface .
oh , christ .
fuck it .
these are all my dolls .
i used to chop their heads off and their arms and stick them up on the wall .
the door's locked , i gotta go around .
just wait here .
jesus christ !
don't do that .
you scared the shit out of me .
you ain't seen nothing yet .
ls your brother ready to go?
yeah , he already left .
come on , inside .
what?
he left?
come on and get toasty .
don't worry about it , he's fine .
i just don't understand why
what was that?
what?
i didn't hear anything .
turn the radio off .
now listen .
i still don't hear anything .
i swear to god , i heard some weird
turn on the headlights , see if something's out there .
calm down , calm down .
jesus h. christ .
it's the fucking tow truck guy .
so , you live alone here?
i mean , just you and your brother?
nah , there's a bunch of us around somewhere .
i think otis is upstairs messing around or something .
you gotta have the marshmallows .
that's what makes it fun .
yeah , i guess .
you sure do a lot of guessing .
thank you .
you're welcome .
wow .
look at him .
he must've been going pretty fast to smash through that wall .
you sure are silly for a guy with glasses .
i like that .
okay , hey .
need those to see , thank you .
how do i look?
terrific , really .
tasty .
ain't the only thing tasty in this house .
okay , okay .
i wonder what time
it's getting kind of late .
don't worry , sugar .
it ain't past my bedtime
are you flirting with me?
what?
oh , no .
great !
they're back .
whoppie fucking do .
excuse me?
i gotta call my dad and tell him we're gonna be late .
can i use your phone , please?
hello?
ain't got one .
oh , hi .
goodness .
you really don't have a phone?
no .
i once had one back in '57 , but
i don't quite remember .
there's nobody round here .
i feel like jaw flapping at no more .
do you think the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone?
his name is rufus , rufus jr .
but we all call him
rj .
makes sense .
what do they call you , sweetie?
i am qualsnarg of the crab nebula .
but you humans can call me jerry .
jerry .
baby , go on and see how rj's doin 'with these nice folks 'automobile .
why don't you just all make yourselves to home?
what brings you kids way out here?
haven't you got something better to do on halloween than wander around out in the sticks?
i thought maybe we'd take in a hoedown .
no , he's just joking .
you are?
i'm sorry , i'm messing with you .
shut up , dude .
oh , i get it .
y'all just think you're too good for the simple pleasures of halloween .
no , just a little too old .
oh really?
i hope something changes your mind someday .
mama , tiny's home .
what about rj?
he was gone before i seen him .
but tiny saw him and said he said he was going down to the yard to get a new wheel .
how long is that gonna take?
probably be back in a couple of hours .
a couple of hours?
what?
can't tiny drive us to a phone?
tiny ain't got no car , he ain't even got a bicycle .
even though i know that you think it is childish , tonight is halloween eve , and to us it is special .
so you are all invited to dinner .
i hope to christ she don't expect us to wear these things .
what ever it is , just do it .
the more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here .
now is not the time to make waves .
jerry .
you'll have to forgive tiny .
he can't hear so much .
that poor baby .
it's his daddy's fault .
earl wasn't a bad man , he never hit me or nothing like that .
one day he just up and went devil on us all .
what happened?
he tried to burn down the house .
he said it was possessed by the spirits .
and tiny was sleeping in the basement where the fire started .
but i don't think earl ever meant to harm us .
tiny was badly burnt , his ears were destroyed and most of his skin .
ls that why he wears the mask?
yeah .
my baby boy gets shy around new people , but he'll warm up to you , especially the girls .
he's a real lady killer .
# all the kids wanna sniff some glue #
# all the kids want somethin 'to do ... #
you're gonna miss a good show tonight .
that's your tough luck .
i thought you kids were all about team spirit .
you ain't done fuck all to cheer me up since you got here .

can we?
gosh , kid , put it on .
she ain't gonna let any of us touch dessert unless you're wearing this damn thing .
mrs. firefly?
do you know anything about the legend of dr. satan?
here we go .
shut up .
i'm not much for gossip and this and that ,
but i have heard  i know all about what you wanna know all about .
otis .
i can't believe you decided to come down and join us .
and you brought little wolf .
oh , my baby .
oh my god .
it's such a special night for me .
i don't know who told you your fairy fables about dr. satan .
we heard it from a captain spaulding up the road at
that old bitch hog don't know shit .
tells this cute little tattle tales to sell his junk , but he don't sell no yankee boys no truth .
something happened , right?
it had to be based on some real incident .
are you , jimmy olsen , cub reporter for the daily asshole?
grampa , watch your language .
i don't think you need to know .
better you leave here with your head still full of kitty cats and puppy dogs .
i really would like to know  hey , he'd really like to know .
enlighten him .
i bet you'd stick your head in fire if i told ya you could see hell .
meanwhile , you're too stupid to realize you got a demon sticking out your ass singing , " holy miss moley ,

she said she'd be here about 11 : 00 , but she never showed up .
i'll run a check on up there by spaulding's and see if there's any accidents , or road closings .

let's see if the nut that runs this place can help us .
take a look at all this crap .
i'd red flag anybody running a joint like this .
sweet baby jesus .
whoever's jerking off on that bell better be gone when i come out , or i'm gonna rip your nuts off .
officers , officers , what can i do for you?
i ain't fired up the birds yet if that's what you've been ring a ding dinging about .
i need you to answer some questions about some missing kids .
oh , i don't know nothin 'about nothin '.
i'm the kind of guy that just minds his own business , if you get what i'm saying .
you seen this girl?
say in the last 24 hours?
yeah , yeah , a cute kid .
ain't my type though .
i like 'em with a little more meat on 'em .
the bigger the cushion , the sweeter the pushin '.
look , clown ass , just answer the damn question .
we ain't interested in your love life , all right?
cut the crap , spaulding and get with the facts .
huh?
what did you see?
who was she with?
where was she going?
i don't know .
she was with some stupid kids .
they's nosing around , asking a bunch of stupid questions .
questions about what?
i don't know .
this and that .
mostly a bunch of tired dr. satan bullshit .
they caught a gander at the display in the back and they figured they's gonna run out and solve the great deadwood mystery .
and how'd they get that idea?
i wrote 'em a map .
out to the old farm road .
i figured , what the hell?
it wouldn't do no harm .
'sides , it's good for my tourist trade .
you can shit 10 bricks for all i care .
what else?
nothin '.
stupid ass kids probably got themselves turned around ass backwards and got theyself lost .
