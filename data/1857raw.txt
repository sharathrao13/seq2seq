strange beautiful grass of green ... with your majestic silver seas .
your mysterious mountains i wish to see closer .
may i land my kinky machine .
the first time i ever saw a movie at the cinematheque francaise ...
i thought only the french ... would house a cinema inside a palace .
the movie was sam fuller's 'shock corridor '.
its images were so powerful , it was like being hypnotised .
i was 20 years old .
it was the late 60s .
i'd come to paris for a year to study french .
here i got my real education .
i became a member of what was kind of a freemasonry .
the freemasonry of cinephiles .
what we'd call 'film buffs '.
i was one of the insatiables ... the ones you'd always find sitting closest to the screen .
why do we sit so close?
maybe it was because we wanted to receive the images first , when they were still new , still fresh , before they cleared the hurdles of the rows behind us .
before they had been relayed back from row to row , spectatorto spectator , until , worn out , second hand , the size of a postage stamp , it returned to the projectionist's cabin .
doctor , i'm not nuts , i'm here forthe paper !
maybe , too , the screen really was a screen .
it screened us from the world .
but there was one evening , in the spring of 1968 , when the world finally burst through the screen .
obeying an obscure coalition of dubious interests , the minister malraux has driven ...
henri langlois out of french cinematheque .
chaillot offered us all a free and fair conception ... of film culture .
now , for bureaucratic reasons , culture's arch enemies ... have seized this bastion of liberty .
resist them !
liberty isn't given !
it's taken !
all those who love film ...
in france .
and abroad .
are with you .
and with henry langlois !
henri langlois created the cinematheque .
because he liked to show movies ... instead of letting them rot in some underground vault .
he'd show any movies , good , bad , old , new ... silents , westerns , thrillers .
all the new wave filmmakers came here to learn their craft .
this is where modern cinema was born .
the police !
langlois had been sacked by the government .
every film buff in paris had turned out in protest .
it was our very own cultural revolution .
excuse me ...
can you remove this?
it's stuck to my lips .
what?
can you remove my cigarette?
it's stuck .
yes , yes ...
of course .
sorry .
what are you?
english?
no , i'm american .
you can put it out now .
what's your name?
matthew .
you're here a lot .
but you nevertalk to anyone .
why are you always alone?
i don't really know anybody .
why are you chained to the gates?
i'm not chained to the gates .
you're awfully clean .
for someone who likes the cinema so much .
do you know jacques?
if shit could shit , it would smell like jacques .
my brother's gone to talk to him .
when he gets back , you'll smell jacques on him .
it's like being around pigs .
you speak english really well .
what?
you speak english really well .
my mother's english .
here's theo .
when i introduce you , just ...
give him a sniff .
come on .
truffaut , godard , chabrol , rivette , and renoir , jean rouch , rohmer are here .
signoret , jean marais and god knows who else .
marcel carne too .
why is carne here?
what should we do?
stay or leave?
i don't know .
theo .
this is matthew .
you were right , he's american .
hi .
i've seen you around .
you've been coming to all the nicholas ray's .
yeah , i really like his movies .
what?
'they live by night '?
more like ...
'johnny guitar 'and 'rebel without a cause '.
you know what godard wrote about him?
no , what?
'nicholas ray is cinema . '
what's up with you?
me?
stay with me !
quick !
bastards !
fascists !
bastards !
assholes !
and that was how i first met theo and isabelle .
i could hear my heart pounding .
i don't know if it was because i'd just been chased by the police , or because i was already in love with my new friends .
as we walked and talked , about politics , about movies , and why the french could never produce good rock bands ...
i'm starving .
i forgot the sandwiches .
i didn't want that night everto end .
thank you .
didn't you bring anything?
no , i'm okay .
please , eat .
don't mind me .
no , i'm really not hungry .
i've broken it now .
take it .
you're very kind , but ...
take it when you're offered it !
thank you .
theo .
don't you have something for matthew?
this is fine .
i gave him a third of mine .
i didn't come here to eat your sandwiches .
he doesn't want it .
yes , he does .
he's just too polite to say he does .
you're both very kind .
where are you from exactly?
san diego .
what about you two?
were you both born in paris?
i entered this world on the champs elysees .
1959 .
on the pavement .
you know what my first words were?
no , what?
'new york herald tribune . '
new york herald tribune .
'new york herald tribune . '
new york herald tribune .
will you come to rome with me?
here , right here .
here !
no , there !
goodnight , matthew .
goodnight .
i was born ... in a trunk ... in the prince's theatre ... in pocatella ...
idaho .
i was born ... in a trunk ... in the ...
prince's theatre ...
i've got some real news this time .
i've just met my first french friends .
hello?
matthew?
who is this?
don't be suspicious .
it's me .
theo?
did i wake you up?
i've been up for ages .
you don't sound like that .
i always sound like this in the morning .
i had to call early , i've a class at nine .
you want to have dinner tomorrow night with isa and me?
a real dinner in a nice restaurant?
no , not in a restaurant .
here .
at home .
yeah , sure , that'd be great .
yes?
okay .
theo , get off the phone .
it's 09 : 00 .
meet us for a drink first .
at the respite .
six o'clock .
you know where it is?
boulevard saint germain?
be there at six .
third floor !
third floor?
there's room in here for all of us .
theo and i are contagious !
we're very contagious .
contagious?
you shouldn't catch us !
it's beautiful .
you think so?
good luck .
evening , maman .
what are you doing here?
we're here for dinner .
what?
with matthew .
didn't isabelle say?
which matthew?
this matthew .
he's our new friend .
matthew , this is my mother .
very pleased to meet you .
likewise .
you're american , are you?
yeah , i'm from california .
matthew lives in a nasty student hotel .
rue malebranche .
so we invited him to dinner .
what's wrong?
what can i say?
i'm cooking fortwo and now there are five of us .
didn't theo tell you?
no , he didn't .
and neither did you .
have you got mashed potatoes for brains or what?
you were supposed to tell her !
you're crazy !
bitch , cow , slut ...
put a sock in it , you two !
i must apologise for my children's behaviour .
no , i'm the one who should be apologising .
please don't put yourself out on account of me .
very sweet of you , seeing as you're completely blameless .
let me look at you .
i want you to make a good impression on papa .
dad , it's me .
we're eating in .
and the cinematheque?
closed until further notice .
can't you see we have a guest?
this is matthew .
sir .
matthew .
matthew's dining with us tonight .
my young matthew .
inspiration is like a baby .
it does not choose a nice , seemly hourto enterthe world .
it has no consideration forthe poor poet .
but when it does come , when it deigns to come , then you know it's ...
young man ...
i was speaking to you .
i imagined you were listening .
i was .
i'm sorry .
what?
nothing , i was just ...
you seem to be mesmerised ... by this tin lighter .
i'd like to know why .
well?
george , matthew's our guest .
i'm genuinely curious .
i'd like to know why .
i was fidgeting with isabelle's lighter .
i wasn't really realising it , and then i noticed and i thought it was rude , so i put it down on the table .
but i put it diagonally across one of these squares .
do you see?
look , i'll show you .
that's when i noticed that the lighter's length ... is exactly the same length as the diagonal itself .
so i put it lengthwise ... along the outside edge .
look , it ... it fits there too .
but it fits there .
and it fits like this and like this .
and this way too .
and i bet you if i just split it in half ... you know it's gonna fit somewhere .
it really fits anywhere .
see?
i was noticing that the more you look at everything ... this table , the objects on it , the refrigerator , this room ... your nose , the world ...
suddenly ... you realise that ... there's some sort of cosmic harmony ... of shapes and sizes .
i was just wondering why .
i don't know why that is .
i know that it is .
you have an interesting friend here .
more interesting , i suspect , than you know .
i mean , when we look around us , what is it we see?
chaos , isn't it?
complete chaos .
yet , viewed from above , as it were , by god , everything suddenly fits together .
my children believe that their demonstrations and sit ins , and happenings ...
they believe that these possess the capacity ... not only to provoke society , but also to transform it .
what is it you are saying?
if langlois is dismissed , we shouldn't do anything?
if immigrants are deported , if students are beaten up , we shouldn't do anything?
what i'm saying is that a little lucidity would not go amiss .
so , everyone's wrong but you?
in france , in italy , germany , america ...
before you can change the world , you must realise you yourself are part of it .
you can't stand outside looking in .
you're the one who stands outside .
you're the one who refused to sign a petition against the vietnam war .
poets don't sign petitions .
they sign poems .
a petition is a poem .
yes .
and a poem is a petition .
thank you , theo , but i'm not gaga yet .
i don't need you to remind me of my own work .
that's right .
a petition is a poem and a poem is a petition .
those are the most famous lines you ever wrote .
and now look at you .
i hope i'll never become like him .
theo .
we should say goodnight .
we've got a long day tomorrow .
george?
yes , sorry .
you were saying?
we should get to bed .
you had something to tell the children .
yes , of course .
i'm sorry .
the cheques are on the mantelpiece .
don't cash them until you need them .
good night , everybody .
good night , papa .
have a safe journey .
good night , dear .
theo?
a very good night to you .
it was a pleasure meeting you , sir .
good night .
good night .
very nice meeting you .
thank you so much for dinner .
it's my pleasure .
invite matthew to spend the night .
i don't like the sound of hotel malebranche .
good night .
why haven't you dazzled us with your philosophical speculations?
i didn't know i was philosophical .
papa was awfully impressed .
papa's full of shit .
i think you're lucky .
i wish my parents were that nice .
other people's parents are always nicerthan our own .
and yet , our own grandparents are always nicerthan other people's .
that's true , that's absolutely true .
i neverthought about it before .
but it's true .
matthew , you're sweet .
this is double the length of ...
i'm for bed .
are you staying?
are you okay?
yeah , i'm okay .
goodnight , matthew .
everybody's got a father .
yes .
but the fact that god doesn't exist , doesn't mean he can take his place .
okay?
yeah , it's fine .
goodnight .
goodnight .
see you in the morning .
see you .
thank ...
thank you .
i need a man to love me .
oh , don't you understand me , babe?
i need a man to love .
i want me , someone to hold me when i ... call out for it .
someone to be around me so i ... won't be afraid of it .
'cos it ...
can't be now .
can't be now .
can't be now .
can't be now .
can't be just loneliness .
what the hell is wrong with me?
no , no , no , it just can't be ...
good morning .
what was that all about?
i was removing the sleep from your eyes .
theo lets me do his every morning .
it's a strange thing to want to do .
didn't you enjoy it?
was i supposed to?
naturally .
up , up , up !
what are you waiting for?
isabelle , i'm not dressed .
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
'i've been memorising this room . '
'ln the future , in my memory ,
i shall live a great deal in this room . '
'queen christina ', where greta garbo bids farewell to the room ... in which she spent the night with john gilbert .
bravo !
the bathroom's at the end of the corridor .
be there in one minute , or we're coming back to get you .
come in .
hello .
good morning .
are you going to church?
oh , sorry .
you want to use my toothbrush?
no .
sure?
i'll use my finger .
sleep well?
yeah .
i mean , fine .
yeah?
you know , matthew ... you really do have the most beautiful pair of lips .
can i touch them?
you wanna touch my lips?
okay .
they're so red and ripe ... and luscious .
so sullen ... brutal .
let's see what you look like with lipstick .
i really should be going .
you'd make such a pretty girl .
ignore her , matthew .
she sucks in all the air around her .
no , i really have to ... be getting back to my hotel .
no , why?
we were going to invite you to stay .
really?
sure .
our parents have left .
they're going to be in trouville for a month .
you might like to move yourthings here .
really?
sure .
but you barely even know me .
this way we get to know you .
you don't have to stay in a hotel , do you?
we'll go and pick up what you need with my mobylette .
come on .
but ...
what about you?
it was my idea .
jesus !
i'm going to check out the cinematheque .
don't take too long .
don't worry , i won't .
i don't have much stuff .
with us , you're not going to need much .
don't forget yourtoothbrush !
okay .
i guess you're surprised to be hearing from me so soon .
but i've just moved into an apartment ... belonging to a famous french author ... whose children are the same age as me and have the same interests .
i'm getting in with the right kind of people .
say hello to father .
i hope he's not still mad at me .
listen to this , matthew .
the difference between keaton and chaplin ... is the difference between prose and poetry , between the aristocrat and the tramp , between eccentricity and mysticism , between man as machine , and man as angel .
not bad , huh?
that's good .
except for me , there's no comparison .
why?
because chaplin's incomparable?
no .
because keaton is incomparable .
you think keaton's greaterthan chaplin?
absolutely i do .
you're not serious .
course i am .
you're crazy .
you can't deny that keaton's funnierthan chaplin .
i can .
you don't think that keaton is funnierthan chaplin?
nobody is funnierthan chaplin .
keaton is .
even when he's not doing anything .
and he looks like godard .
keaton is a real filmmaker .
chaplin , all he cares about is his own performance ...
his own ego !
that is bullshit .
it's not bullshit !
yes , it is .
you americans understand fuck all about your own culture .
no wonder you've never got the point ofjerry lewis .
don't even get me started on jerry lewis !
when chaplin wanted to have a beautiful shot , he knew how .
betterthan keaton , betterthan anybody .
you rememberthe last shot of 'city lights '?
he looks at the flower girl , she looks at him , and don't forget she'd been blind , so she was seeing him ... forthe very first time .
and it's as if , through her eyes , we also see him forthe very first time .
charlot , the most famous man in the world .
as if we've never seen him before .
isa , if you play that fucking record again ,
i'll break it in two , okay?
but you like janis joplin .
stop it !
i said stop it , isabelle !
stop !
stop !
matthew , tell me , what film?
what?
name a film ... where someone tap dancing drives someone else crazy .
forfeit to pay if you can't answer .
you'll pay the forfeit !
'top hat '!
fred astaire is dancing over ginger rogers 'room .
and she's mad because he wakes her up .
i'm right .
he's good .
you thinking what i'm thinking?
what?
'bande a part '.
you're right .
why are you two looking at me like that?
well ... you see , my little matthew ...
there's something theo and i have been meaning to do for a long time , but we've been waiting forthe right person to do it with .
and i think you're finally it !
to do what?
try to beat the record of 'bande a part '.
what record?
you've seen 'bande a part '.
the scene where the three of them race through the louvre .
they try to beat the world record of 9 minutes 45 seconds .
of course !
we're going to beat their record .
what?
what's the matter?
nothing really .
not afraid , are you?
no , i'm not afraid .
what then?
it's easy for you two .
i'm an american , an alien .
if i get caught , i get deported .
we're not going to get caught .
you don't know that .
they weren't caught in 'bande a part ', we won't be caught either .
it's a movie !
go get papa's stopwatch .
it's a great idea , but ...
it's not ...
this is a test .
are you going to pass it or fail it?
be careful .
a lot depends on how you answer .
9 minutes and 28 seconds .
we beat the record by 17 seconds !
we did it !
matthew , my little matthew .
you were wonderful !
'we accept him .
one of us . '
'we accept him .
one of us . '
we accept him .
one of us .
we accept him , we accept him .
gooble gooble , gooble gooble .
'we accept him .
one of us . '
one of us .
when your mother , sends back all your invitations .
and your father ... to your sister ... he explains ... that you're tired of yourself ... and all of your creations ,
won't you come see me ...
queen jane?
won't you come see me ...
we accept you .
one of us , one of us !
now all of the flower ladies want back what they have lent you .
that's maman .
i'm too wet to answer .
isa's smart but she doesn't know how to deal with parents .
what do you mean?
i mean , it's not enough to ignore them , they should all be arrested , put on trial , confess their crimes , sent to the country for self criticism and re education !
they're already in the country .
they are at the seaside .
that's different .
hello?
hello?
too bad .
my parents never go anywhere .
you have the house to yourselves .
where are you going?
i gotta get out of these clothes .
it'll be cold in your room .
come into mine .
okay .
you can wearthis .
thanks .
i'm going to get a coke .
want one?
okay .
there may be trouble ahead ...
matthew !
yeah?
open the door .
my hands are full .
just a second .
why didn't you open the door?
i was ...
i was dressing .
what film?
in what film does a chorus line dance like this ... with a singer in a fur coat?
i've seen this film?
we saw it together .
we did?
give me a clue .
certainly not .
come on , be a sport .
the director's name .
no .
the number of words in the title .
i said no .
isabelle !
no .
the first letter of the first word .
god , you're pathetic .
isn't he pathetic , matthew?
matthew , i bet you know .
don't you dare help him .
did the sphinx give oedipus a clue?
fuck you .
give up?
yeah .
'blonde venus '.
shit .
marlene dietrich , 1932 .
i know that .
forfeit .
if you insist .
i dare you to do now ... in front of us , what i've watched you do ... in front of her .
who?
i don't know what you're talking about .
oh yes , you do , my pet .
forfeit .
what a bitch you are .
a bitch and a sadist .
are you going to pay the forfeit or not?
very well .
do it the way you did it , when you thought no one was watching .
let's have a drink .
i'll meet you downstairs .
matthew .
yes?
yes .
why don't you admit you were thrilled?
what?
weren't you just a bit excited?
what're you trying to get me to say?
nothing .
i asked you a question .
you know who you sound like?
isabelle .
why not?
she's my twin sister .
you two are twins?
yes .
she'd be me if she were a man .
you're not identical .
yes , we are .
we're siamese twins .
joined here .
you're a strange one , theo .
half an hour ago ... you looked at her as though you wanted to strangle her .
i did .
i don't understand you .
do you have brothers or sisters?
two older sisters .
didn't you ever want to strangle them?
course i did , but i never masturbated in front of them , and ... they never forced me to do anything i never wanted to do .
do you think isabelle forced me?
deep down , i knew things couldn't go on as before .
now the stakes had been raised .
for a while , there was a kind of truce between theo and isabelle .
and then one evening ...
theo !
what film?
what film?
name a film where a cross marks the spot of a murder .
or pay the forfeit .
you too , matthew .
me?
what ...
what have i done?
name a film or pay the forfeit .
time's up .
you didn't even give me a chance .
the film?
'scarface . 'howard hawks .
1932 .
and the forfeit?
well ...
now .
as you know , isabelle , i'm not a sadist .
i just want to see everyone happy , no one left out .
so , i'd like you ... and matthew ... to make love in front of me .
but not in here , i don't fancy sleeping in someone else's spunk .
no offence , matthew .
where?
in the spare room .
in front of the delacroix .
maybe one reproduction will inspire another .
i won't do it .
you won't do it?
you wouldn't .
matthew isn't my type .
okay .
i need to go to the bathroom .
matthew !
matthew .
matthew .
yes?
this is silly .
come out of there .
okay .
okay , all right !
too late , too late !
you're hurting me .
i'm not violent .
i'm against violence .
i'm not gonna resist , look .
so , shut up .
okay?
okay .
you aren't being very gallant .
is the prospect of making love to me so hateful?
i've seen you .
i saw you in bed together .
our guest has been spying on us .
that wasn't a friendly thing to do .
especially when we've been so hospitable .
okay , okay !
i'm not resisting , i'm not resisting !
how sweet of you to keep my image next to your heart .
i didn't mean ...
good .
matthew !
come on !
wake up !
come on , wake up !
isabelle?
no , i'm theo .
where's isabelle?
you have to help me .
sorry .
oh my god !
that was the best one .
what about yesterday?
in papa's study .
you thought that was better?
please , please , please .
what?
stay inside .
okay .
matthew .
my love .
my first love .
my great love .
my great lover .
my valentino .
my funny valentino .
i thought you had many lovers .
when i first saw you at the cinematheque , you and theo ... you looked so cool .
so sophisticated .
like a movie star .
i was .
i was acting , matthew .
how did you and ... how did you and theo ... come together the way that you are?
theo and me?
it was love at first sight .
but he's never been inside you?
he's always inside me .
what would you do ...
what would you do if your parents found out?
it must never happen .
yeah , i know .
but ...
what if it did?
it must never , never happen .
i understand that , but let's say that it did happen .
what would you ... what would you do?
i would kill myself .
where are you going?
kitchen .
i have to get something to eat .
good luck .
theo .
theo .

no , thank you .
go on , it's good .
no .
it's really , try some .
no .
just try a little bit ...
no , thank you .
i want you to know that i'm grateful .
grateful?
remember what you told me in the cafe , about you and isabelle?
you were right .
for me you two are ...
like two halves of the same person .
and now you've made me feel like i'm a part of you .
both of you .
let's get something straight , okay?
you're a nice boy and i like you a lot .
but , no ... it wasn't always meant to be the three of us .
i told you something else , remember?
that isa and i are siamese twins .
yeah .
i wasn't joking .
what's this?
that , my dear brother , is a ... cheese fondue accompanied by a compote of broccoli and prunes .
and this?
that's ratatouille .
you expect me to eat this muck?
you expected me to cook it .
i preferto starve .
you will .
there's nothing else .
matthew?
can i serve you?
the fondue orthe ratatouille?
which is which?
this is fondue and this is ratatouille .
no .
this is the fondue and this is the ratatouille .
the ratatouille .
ratatouille .
that's fine .
eat it as if you are in some exotic country ... and this is the national dish .
it looks like he's vomiting in reverse .
it's horrible , isn't it?
i'm sorry , i know you tried .
thank you , i'm glad somebody appreciates my efforts .
there's nothing in the house?
nothing you'd want to eat .
and we cashed all the cheques?
yes .
so what do we do now?
i'm going to call papa .
the phone is dead !
illegitimate son of a rock and roll star .
illegitimate son of a rock and roll star .

thanks , that's sweet .
call me .
okay , with pleasure .
see you .
we hardly left the apartment any more .
we didn't know or care if it was day or night .
we were drifting out to sea , leaving the world far behind us .
too strong for you .
no , it was really good .
good?
yeah .
again?
no .
clapton is god , matthew .
i don't believe in god .
but if i did , he would be a black left handed guitarist .
this is not chaplin and keaton .
this is clapton and hendrix .
clapton reinvented the electric guitar .
clapton reinvented the guitar !
matthew , believe me .
clapton plugs in a guitar ...
okay , jimi hendrix is different ...
he plugs in an electric guitar and he plays it like an acoustic guitar .
hendrix plugs in an electric guitar , he plays with his teeth !
there are soldiers in the vietnam war right now .
who are they listening to?
clapton?
no .
they're listening to hendrix .
the guy who tells the truth .
it's all fucked up !
you're talking about soldiers in vietnam?
yes .
what are they doing in vietnam?
they're at war .
what are they doing?
they're fighting .
they are killing peasants .
they're dying , too !
they're killing children , they're burning fields !
they wanna be there .
they wanna die and they wanna kill people .
shouldn't you be in vietnam?
shouldn't you be in vietnam?
i don't believe in violence .
where are you now?
shouldn't you be in vietnam?
i'm lucky , i'm in a university .
i have friends who aren't in university ... and they're expendable .
you're not lucky .
i am fucking lucky .
'no , i'm against violence .
i don't agree with your war . '
maybe in france .
in america you have to go .
if you don't go , you go to jail .
i preferto go in jail , instead of killing people .
you don't understand .
i read it in 'cahiers de cinema '.
a filmmaker is like a peeping tom , a voyeur .
it's as if the camera is ... the keyhole to your parents 'bedroom .
and you spy on them , and you're disgusting .
and you feel guilty , but you can't ...
iook away .
it makes films like crimes and ... directors like criminals .
like it should be illegal .
there goes my chance to be a filmmaker .
my parents always left the bedroom door open .
you'll have to direct theatre , not cinema .
maybe .
up .
come on !
my parents only fucked once in their life .
that's why we're twins .
they didn't want to make it twice .
hey joe !
where are you going with that gun in your hand?
hey joe !
where are you going with that gun in your hand?
and hey joe !
where are you going with that gun in your hand?
i'm going down to shoot my old lady .
you know i found her messing around with another man .
i'm going down to shoot my old lady .
you know i found her messing around town .
don't be alarmed , matthew .
it's good news .
it only happens once a month .
i love you , isabelle .
i love you too , matthew .
yeah , but i really love you .
and i really , really love you too .
we both do .
oh , yeah .
that's not what i wanted you to say .
what do you want us to say?
i wanted you to say you love me .
we just did .
no , you said you love me too .
i don't want you to say that you love me too .
i want you to say that you love me .
we love you , we love you .
that's not right either .
you have to say it first .
we can't , you already said it first .
why am i always the first to say it?
poor matthew .
we do love you very much .
i don't want to be loved very much .
i want to be loved .
you know when someone wants it , there's no such thing as love .
there are only proofs of love .
are you ready to give us a proof of your love?
you want proof of my love?
okay .
get out of the bath .
shaving cream .
razor .
thanks .
what are you doing?
what do you think i'm doing?
you're not serious?
yes , i am .
don't worry .
it's an operation i've performed before .
relax , it grows back .
you're both fucking crazy !
what's the matter?
this is what you call proof of love?
turning me into a freak?
'one of us . '
it's just a game .
'one of us . '
it's just a game !
a game , isabelle?
a game?
think about it .
is this something you do to each other?
you want me to be a little boy for you?
a little pre pubescent theo at six who you can play games with?
and you could touch peepee .
i'll show you mine , you show me yours !
just calm down .
we hear you .
theo , think about it .
think .
you sleep in the same bed together every night .
you bathe together , you pee in the john together .
you play these little games .
i wish you could step out of yourselves and just look .
why are you so cruel?
because i love you .
a strange way of showing it .
i really love you .
both of you .
and i admire you .
and i look at you and i listen to you and i think ... you're never gonna grow .
you won't grow like this .
you won't .
not as long as you keep clinging to each otherthe way that you do .
have you ever been out on a date?
a date?
yeah , a date .
what kind of date?
have you ever been out with a boy?
with theo .
not theo .
have you ever been out with a boy , that you met at school?
i was nevertaken to a school prom .
we don't have proms in france .
you have dates in france .
have you ever been out with a boy?
why do you keep asking me that?
you know i haven't .
would you like to?
is this an invitation?
it's an invitation .
would you like to go out on a date with me?
just the two of us .
don't look at theo .
you don't need his permission .
we can't sit in the front row , we have to sit at the back .
the front is for people who don't have dates .
sorry .
excuse me .
on a date , you always sit at the back .
ladies and gentlemen ... the motion picture you are about to see is a story of music .
i play the role of tom miller , an agent .
a small time theatrical agent who had been a ...
well , you'll see .
this picture was photographed in the grandeur of cinemascope .
pardon me .
sorry i can't stay , but i have a train on tap .
all the best , georgie .
you can't stand to hear me sing again , huh?
you know it isn't that .
you'll never know .
no , i know i won't be fooled .
when i'm being true .
but if you guess it ,
i'll confess it .
oh , darling , i would like to know .
or perhaps you'll never ...
no , no , you'll never ...
oh , no , you'll never ... ever know .
you'll never know .
when i looked at the tv screen ,
i remembered the battle of the cinematheque .
except this time the demonstrators weren't film buffs .
they weren't even just students any longer .
it was hard to figure out what was happening , but ... shops had closed their doors , factories had gone on strike ... and it was beginning to spread all over paris .
we're willing to consider all legitimate demands .
theo and i never watch television .
we're purest .
pure and hard .
let's go .
yeah , but ...
jesus !
what's wrong?
they're not mine .
no , your room .
no .
in all the time i've been here , i haven't seen your room .
you do have a room of your own?
of course i have .
don't think i always live in theo's pigsty .
how come we never go in there?
no one's making love on my bed .
it's your room , it's part of you , i wanna see it .
just tonight .
no , no , and no .
i discovered a side of isabelle i'd never seen before .
a secret side she hadn't wanted me to see .
i suddenly thought of my sisters 'bedrooms in san diego .
i thought of our house and our neighbours 'houses , all alike , with their green lawns and their sprinklers , and their station wagons parked outside .
that you're dreaming of .
i know the word ...
that you long to hear .
i know your deepest secret fear .
i'm a spy ...
in the house of love .
i know the dream ...
that you're dreaming of .
what sculpture?
i always wanted to make love to the venus de milo .
i can't stop you .
i've got no arms .
i can't stop you .
what's wrong?
what's wrong?
don't .
don't .
don't .
don't listen to it .
don't cry , don't cry .
please , leave me alone .
leave me alone , please .
please !
go away !
isabelle !
isabelle !
theo , open up !
theo !
isabelle !
you're gonna hurt yourself !
who are you?
what are you talking about?
what are you doing in my room?
get out !
get out !
theo !
theo !
theo !
theo !
theo !
theo .
a revolution isn't a gala dinner .
it cannot be created like a book , a drawing or a tapestry .
it cannot unfold with such elegance , tranquility and delicacy , or with such sweetness , affability , courtesy , restraint and generosity .
a revolution is an uprising , a violent act ... by which one class overthrows another .
chateau lafite , 1955 .
chateau chasse spleen , 1959 .
grand vin , 1937 .
happy birthday , papa !
again?
listen , matthew .
yes?
you're a big movie buff , right?
yes .
then think of mao as a great director ... making a movie with a cast of millions .
all those millions of red guards marching together into the future ... with the little red book in their hands .
books , not guns .
culture , not violence .
can't you see what a beautiful epic movie that would make?
i guess , but ...
it's easy to say books not guns .
but it's not true .
it's not 'books '.
it's 'book ', a book .
just one book .
shut up .
you sound just like my father .
no , listen to me .
the red guards that you admire , they all carry the same book , they all sing the same songs , they all parrot the same slogans .
in this big epic movie , everybody is an extra .
that gives me the creeps .
i'm sorry to say it , but ... for me there is a distinct contradiction .
why?
because ... if you really believed what you were saying , you'd be out there .
where?
out there on the street .
i don't know what you mean .
yes , you do .
there's something going on out there .
something that feels like it could be really important .
something that feels like things could change .
even i get that .
but you're not out there .
you're inside with me , drinking expensive wine , talking about film .
talking about maoism .
why?
that's enough .
no , tell me why .
ask yourself why .
i don't think you believe it .
i think you buy the lamp , you put up the posters , but it ain't ...
i don't think you ...
look , you speak too much .
okay .
theo , just listen to me .
i think you prefer ...
i think you prefer when ... when the word 'together 'means not ... a million , but just two .
boys , boys !
orthree .
isa , come and join us .
no , thank you .
it stinks of whores here .
thanks a lot .
i've got a surprise for you in the salon .
i'm getting right in !
it's beautiful .
come on , get in .
we did this when we were little .
more wine?
thank you .
isabelle .
god , your breath is foul .
oh , i'm sorry .
you're drunk .
yeah , i am drunk .
and you are beautiful .
and tomorrow morning , i'll be sober , but you'll still be beautiful .
go to sleep , matthew .
yes .
is it time to sleep?
idiot , you can hardly keep your eyes open .
night night .
theo .
theo .
wake up .
what is it?
i want you to listen .
why?
because ...
i love you .
you know that?
i love you too .
you love me too?
that's funny .
are you listening?
it's for ever , right?
what's for ever?
the two of us .
right?
why did matthew say that?
what did matthew say?
that we're monsters , freaks .
i just want you to tell me that it's for ever .
it's for ever .
isa ...
you don't understand .
we'll talk about it in the morning .
i promise .
good .
we must leave now , darling .
already?
would you like to have dinner with them?
we must leave on tiptoe .
isa !
what's happening?
the street came flying into the room !
what?
the street came flying into the room !
what's that smell?
it's tear gas .
in the streets !
in the streets !
go !
go on !
in the streets !
in the streets !
in the streets !
in the streets !
matthew !
isabelle !
isabelle !
in the streets !
in the streets !
in the streets !
this is just the start , the fight goes on !
i light it up and throw it on the right .
theo , this is wrong .
this is wonderful .
this is violence !
it's not violence .
it's wonderful .
this is fucking fascism in a fucking bottle !
i'm no fascist !
the cops are fascists !
and then police hit people .
shut up !
you do not understand !
this is wrong .
listen to me .
this is what they do .
this is not what we do .
we use this .
we do this .
we use this !
stop it !
isabelle .
isabelle .
isab ... !
death to the cops !
fascists !
this is just the start , the fight goes on !
this is just the start , the fight goes on !
