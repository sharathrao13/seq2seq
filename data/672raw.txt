harry .
harry , open the door .

how lovely to see ...
uncle vernon , i need you to sign this form .
what is it?
nothing .
school stuff .
later perhaps , if you behave .
i will if she does .
oh , you're still here , are you?
yes .
don't say yes in that ungrateful way .
damn good of my brother to keep you .
he'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep .
is that my dudders?
is that my little neffy pooh?
give us a kiss .
come on .
up , up .
take marge's suitcase upstairs .
okay .
finish that off for mommy .
good boy , rippy pooh .
can i tempt you , marge?
just a small one .
excellent nosh , petunia .
a bit more .
usually just a fry up for me , what with 12 dogs .
just a bit more .
that's a boy .
you wanna try a little drop of brandy?
a little drop of brandy brandy windy wandy for rippy pippy pooh?
what are you smirking at?
where did you send the boy , vernon?
st. brutus '.
it's a fine institution for hopeless cases .
do they use a cane at st. brutus ', boy?
oh , yeah .
yeah .
i've been beaten loads of times .
excellent .
i won't have this namby pamby ... ... wishy washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it .
you mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out .
it's all to do with blood .
bad blood will out .
what is it the boy's father did , petunia?
nothing .
he didn't work .
he was unemployed .
and a drunk too , no doubt?
that's a lie .
what did you say?
my dad wasn't a drunk .
don't worry .
don't fuss , petunia .
i have a very firm grip .
i think it's time you went to bed .
quiet , vernon .
you , clean it up .
actually , it's nothing to do with the father .
it's all to do with the mother .
you see it all the time with dogs .
if something's wrong with the bitch , then something's wrong with the pup .
shut up !
shut up !
right .
let me tell you ...
vernon !
vernon !
vernon , do something !
stop !
i've got you , marge .
i've got you .
hold on , hold on .
get off .
don't you dare !
sorry .
oh , vernon .
oh , god .
marge !
please !
marge !
come back !
you bring her back !
you bring her back now .
you put her right !
no .
she deserved what she got .
keep away from me .
you can't do magic outside school .
yeah?
try me .
they won't let you back now .
you've nowhere to go .
i don't care .
anywhere is better than here .
welcome to the knight bus ... ... emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard .
my name is stan shunpike , and i will be your conductor for this evening .
what you doing down there?
i fell over .
what you fell over for?
i didn't do it on purpose .
well , come on , then .
let's not wait for the grass to grow .
what you looking at?
nothing .
well , come on , then .
in .
no , no , no .
i'll get this .
you get in .
come on .
come on .
move on , move on .
take her away , ern .
yeah , take it away , ernie .
it's going to be a bumpy ride .
what did you say your name was?
i didn't .
whereabouts are you headed?
the leaky cauldron .
that's in london .
you hear that?
the leaky cauldron .
that's in london .
the leaky cauldron .
if you have pea soup ... ... make sure you eat it before it eats you .
but the muggles .
can't they see us?
muggles?
they don't see nothing , do they?
no , but if you jab them with a fork , they feel .
ernie , little old lady at 12 o'clock !
ten , nine , eight ... ... seven , six , five ... ... four , three , three and a half ... ... two , one and three quarters .
yes !
who is that?
that man .
who is that?
who is ...?
that is sirius black , that is .
don't tell me you've never been hearing of sirius black .
he's a murderer .
got himself locked up in azkaban for it .
how did he escape?
well , that's the question , isn't it?
he's the first one that done it .
he was a big supporter of ... ... you know who .
i reckon you've heard of him .
yeah .
him i've heard of .
ernie , two double deckers at 12 o'clock .
they're getting closer , ernie .
ernie , they're right on top of us !
mind your head .
hey , guys?
guys?
why the long faces?
yeah , yeah .
nearly there .
nearly there .
the leaky cauldron .
next stop , knockturn alley .
mr. potter , at last .
take it away , ern .
yeah , take it away , ernie !
room 11 .
hedwig .
right smart bird you got there , mr. potter .
he arrived here just five minutes before yourself .
as minister for magic , it is my duty to inform you , mr. potter ... ... earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located ... ... a little south of sheffield , circling a chimney stack .
the accidental magic reversal department was dispatched immediately .
she has been properly punctured and her memory modified .
she will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever .
so that's that ... ... and no harm done .
pea soup?
no , thank you .
minister?
yes?
i don't understand .
understand?
i broke the law .
underage wizards can't use magic at home .
come now .
the ministry doesn't send people to azkaban ... ... for blowing up their aunts .
on the other hand , running away like that , given the state of things ... ... was very , very irresponsible .
" the state of things , " sir?
we have a killer on the loose .
sirius black , you mean?
but what's he got to do with me?
nothing , of course .
you're safe .
and that's what matters .
and tomorrow you'll be on your way back to hogwarts .
these are your new schoolbooks .
i took the liberty ... ... of having them brought here .
now tom will show you to your room .
hedwig .
oh , by the way , harry .
whilst you're here , it would be best if you didn't ... ... wander .
right !
you gonna move that bus or what?
housekeeping .
i'll come back later .
i'm warning you , hermione .
keep that beast away from scabbers , or i'll turn it into a tea cozy .
it's a cat , ronald .
what do you expect?
it's in his nature .
a cat?
is that what they told you?
looks like a pig with hair .
that's rich ... ... coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush .
crookshanks , just ignore the mean little boy .
harry .
harry .
egypt .
what's it like?
brilliant .
loads of old stuff ... ... like mummies , tombs , even scabbers enjoyed himself .
egyptians used to worship cats .
along with the dung beetle .
not flashing that clipping again?
i haven't shown anyone .
no , not a soul .
not unless you count tom .
the day maid .
night maid .
cook .
the bloke who fixed the toilet .
harry .
mrs. weasley .
good to see you , dear .
good to see you .
got everything?
yes .
yes?
all your books?
it's all upstairs .
your clothes?
everything .
good boy .
thank you .
harry potter .
mr. weasley .
harry , wonder if i might have a word?
yeah , sure .
hermione .
good morning , mr. weasley .
looking forward to a new term?
yeah .
it should be great .
harry , some within the ministry would strongly discourage me ... ... from divulging what i'm about to reveal to you .
but i think that you need to know the facts .
you are in danger .
grave danger .
has this anything to do with sirius black , sir?
what do you know about sirius black , harry?
only that he's escaped from azkaban .
do you know why?
thirteen years ago , when you stopped ...
voldemort .
don't say his name .
sorry .
when you stopped you know who ... ... black lost everything .
but to this day , he still remains a faithful servant .
and in his mind ... ... you are the only thing that stands in the way ... ... of you know who returning to power .
and that is why ... ... he has escaped from azkaban .
to find you .
and kill me .
harry , swear to me that whatever you might hear ... ... you won't go looking for black .
mr. weasley ... ... why would i go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
quick .
quick .
ron , ron !
oh , for goodness 'sake !
don't lose him !
i didn't mean to blow her up .
i just ...
i lost control .
brilliant .
honestly , ron , it's not funny .
harry was lucky not to be expelled .
i was lucky not to be arrested .
i still think it was brilliant .
come on .
everywhere else is full .
who do you think that is?
professor r. j. lupin .
do you know everything?
how is it she knows everything?
it's on his suitcase , ronald .
oh .
do you think he's really asleep?
seems to be .
why?
i gotta tell you something .
let me get this straight .
sirius black escaped from azkaban ... ... to come after you?
yeah .
but they'll catch black , won't they?
i mean , everyone's looking for him .
sure .
except no one's ever broken out of azkaban before ... ... and he's a murderous , raving lunatic .
thanks , ron .
why are we stopping?
we can't be there yet .
what's going on?
i don't know .
maybe we've broken down .
ouch , ron .
that was my foot .
there's something moving out there .
i think someone's coming aboard .
bloody hell !
what's happening?
harry .
harry , are you all right?
thank you .
here , eat this .
it'll help .
it's all right .
it's chocolate .
what was that thing that came?
it was a dementor .
one of the guards of azkaban .
it's gone now .
it was searching the train for sirius black .
if you'll excuse me , i need to have a little word with the driver .
eat .
you'll feel better .
what happened to me?
well , you sort of went rigid .
we thought maybe you were having a fit or something .
and did either of you two ... ... you know ... ... pass out?
no .
i felt weird , though .
like i'd never be cheerful again .
but someone was screaming .
a woman .
no one was screaming , harry .
welcome !
welcome to another year at hogwarts .
now , i'd like to say a few words ... ... before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast .
first , i'm pleased to welcome professor r. j. lupin ... ... who's kindly consented to fill the post ... ... of defense against the dark arts teacher .
good luck , professor .
of course .
that's why he knew to give you the chocolate , harry .
potter .
is it true you fainted?
i mean , you actually fainted?
shove off , malfoy .
how did he find out?
just forget it .
our care of magical creatures teacher ... ... has decided to retire ... ... in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs .
fortunately , i'm delighted to announce ... ... that his place will be taken by none other ... ... than our own rubeus hagrid .
finally , on a more disquieting note ... ... at the request of the ministry of magic ... ... hogwarts will , until further notice , play host to the dementors of azkaban ... ... until such a time as sirius black is captured .
the dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds .
now whilst i've been assured ... ... that their presence will not disrupt our day to day activities ... ... a word of caution .
dementors are vicious creatures .
they'll not distinguish ... ... between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way .
therefore , i must warn each and every one of you ... ... to give them no reason to harm you .
it is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving .
but you know , happiness can be found ... ... even in the darkest of times ... ... if one only remembers to turn on the light .
fortuna major .
here , listen .
she just won't let me in .
fortuna major .
no , no .
wait , wait .
watch this .
amazing .
just with my voice .
fortuna major .
yes , all right .
go in .
thank you .
still doing that after three years .
she can't even sing .
exactly .
hey , man .
hey , man .
oh , god .
that's awful .
green .
that's a monkey .
what is that?
you call that a monkey?
do not give him one again .
hey , neville , try an elephant .
ron , catch .
i will .
i think we have a winner .
oh , don't try one of them .
oh , no .
look at him .
his face .
welcome , my children .
in this room , you shall explore the noble art of divination .
in this room , you shall discover if you possess the sight .
hello .
i am professor trelawney .
together we shall cast ourselves into the future .
this term , we'll focus on tasseomancy , the art of reading tea leaves .
so please , take the cup of the person sitting opposite you .
what do you see?
the truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book , waiting to be read .
but first , you must broaden your minds .
first , you must look beyond .
what a load of rubbish .
where did you come from?
me?
i've been here all this time .
you , boy ...
is your grandmother quite well?
i think so .
i wouldn't be so sure of that .
give me the cup .
pity .
broaden your minds .
your aura is pulsing , dear .
are you in the beyond?
i think you are .
sure .
look at the cup .
tell me what you see .
yeah .
harry's got sort of a wonky cross .
that's trials and suffering .
and that there could be the sun and that's happiness .
so ... ... you're gonna suffer , but you're gonna be happy about it .
give me the cup .
oh , my dear boy .
my dear ... ... you have the grim .
the grin?
what's the grin?
not the grin , you idiot .
the grim .
taking form of a giant spectral dog .
it's among the darkest omens in our world .
it's an omen ... ... of death .
you don't think that grim thing's got anything to do with sirius black?
oh , honestly , ron .
if you ask me , divination's a woolly discipline .
now , ancient runes , that's a fascinating subject .
ancient runes?
exactly how many classes are you taking?
a fair few .
hang on .
that's not possible .
ancient runes is in the same time as divination .
you have to be in two classes at once .
don't be silly .
how could anyone be in two classes at once?
broaden your minds .
use your inner eye to see the future .
that's it .
come on , now .
come closer .
less talking , if you don't mind .
i got a real treat for you today .
a great lesson .
so follow me .
right , you lot .
less chattering .
form a group over there .
and open your books to page 49 .
exactly how do we do that?
just stroke the spine , of course .
goodness me .
don't be such a wimp , longbottom .
i'm okay .
okay .
i think they're funny .
oh , yeah .
terribly funny .
witty .
god , this place has gone to the dogs .
wait until father hears dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes .
shut up , malfoy .
dementor !
dementor !
just ignore him .
you're supposed to stroke it .
yeah .
isn't he beautiful?
say hello to buckbeak .
hagrid , exactly what is that?
that , ron , is a hippogriff .
first thing you wanna know is they're very proud creatures .
very easily offended .
you do not want to insult a hippogriff .
it may be the last thing you ever do .
now , who'd like to come and say hello?
well done , harry .
well done .
come on now .
now ... ... you have to let him make the first move .
it's only polite .
so ... ... step up .
give him a nice bow .
then you wait and see if he bows back .
if he does , you can go and touch him .
if not ...
well , we'll get to that later .
just make your bow .
nice and low .
back off , harry .
back off .
keep still .
keep still .
well done , harry .
well done .
here , you big brute , you .
right .
i think you can go and pat him now .
go on .
don't be shy .
nice and slow , now .
nice and slow .
slow .
not so fast , harry .
slow down , harry .
that's it ...
nice and slow .
now let him come to you .
slowly , now , slowly , slowly ...
that's it ...
yes !
well done !
well done , harry , well done !
does he get to fly?
i think he may let you ride him now .
what?
come on .
hey , hey , hey !
put you over here , just behind the wing joint .
don't pull out any of his feathers , because he won't thank you for that .
well done , harry , and well done , buckbeak .
that was wicked , harry !
oh , please .
well done , well done .
how am i doing me first day?
brilliant , professor .
you're not dangerous at all , are you , you great ugly brute !
malfoy , no ...
no !
buckbeak !
whoa , whoa , whoa ...
whoa !
buckbeak !
away , you silly creature ...
it's killed me !
calm down .
it's just a scratch !
hagrid !
he has to be taken to the hospital .
i'm the teacher .
i'll do it .
you're gonna regret this .
class dismissed !
you and your bloody chicken !
does it hurt terribly , draco?
it comes and it goes .
still , i consider myself lucky .
madam pomfrey said another minute and i could've lost my arm .
i can't do homework for weeks .
listen to the idiot .
he's really laying it on thick , isn't he?
at least hagrid didn't get fired .
i hear draco's father's furious .
we haven't heard the end of this .
he's been sighted !
who?
sirius black !
dufftown?
that's not far from here .
you don't think he'd come to hogwarts , do you?
with dementors at every entrance?
dementors?
he slipped past them once .
who's to say he won't do it again?
that's right .
black could be anywhere .
it's like trying to catch smoke .
like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands .
intriguing , isn't it?
would anyone like to venture a guess ... ... as to what is inside?
that's a boggart , that is .
very good , mr. thomas .
now , can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?
no one knows .
when did she get here?
boggarts are shape shifters .
they take the shape of whatever a person fears the most .
that's what makes them so ...
so terrifying , yes , yes , yes ...
luckily , a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart .
let's practice it now .
without wands , please .
after me .
riddikulus !
riddikulus !
very good .
a little louder and very clear .
00 : 39 : 18, 332 ... > 00 : 39 : 20, 437 riddikulus !
riddikulus !
this class is ridiculous .
very good .
so much for the easy part .
you see , the incantation alone is not enough .
what really finishes a boggart is laughter .
you need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing .
let me explain .
neville , would you join me , please?
come on , don't be shy .
come on .
come on .
hello .
neville , what frightens you most of all?
professor snape .
sorry?
professor snape .
professor snape .
yes , frightens all .
you live with your grandmother .
i don't want it to turn into her , either .
no ... ... it won't .
i want you to picture her clothes .
only her clothes , very clearly , in your mind .
she carries a red handbag ...
we don't need to hear .
as long as you see it , we'll see it .
now , when i open that wardrobe ... ... here's what i want you to do .
excuse me .
imagine professor snape in your grandmother's clothes .
can you do that?
yes .
wand at the ready .
one , two , three .
think , neville , think .
riddikulus !
wonderful , neville , wonderful !
incredible !
okay ... ... to the back , neville .
everyone , form a line ...
form a line !
i want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most ... ... and turn it into something funny .
next !
ron !
concentrate .
face your fear .
be brave !
wand at the ready , ron .
riddikulus !
yes !
you see?
very good , very good !
marvelous !
absolutely , very , very enjoyable !
parvati !
next !
show us what you see .
keep your nerve .
steady .
riddikulus !
and next !
step up , step up !
wonderful , wonderful !
here !
riddikulus !
right .
sorry about that .
that's enough for today .
collect your books from the back .
that's the end of the lesson .
thank you !
sorry !
sorry , you can have too much of a good thing .
remember , these visits to hogsmeade village are a privilege .
should your behavior reflect poorly on the school ... ... that privilege shall not be extended again .
no permission form signed , no visiting the village .
that's the rule , potter .
those with permission , follow me .
those without , stay put .
i thought if you signed it , then i could ...
i can't .
only a parent or a guardian can sign .
since i am neither , it would be inappropriate .
i'm sorry , potter .
that's my final word .
forget about it , guys .
see you later .
professor , can i ask you something?
you want to know why i stopped you facing that boggart , yes?
i thought it'd be obvious .
i assumed it would take the shape of lord voldemort .
i did think of voldemort at first .
but then i remembered that night on the train ... ... and the dementor .
i'm very impressed .
that suggests what you fear the most is fear itself .
this is very wise .
before i fainted ... ... i heard something .
a woman ... ... screaming .
dementors force us to relive our very worst memories .
our pain becomes their power .
i think it was my mother ... ... the night she was murdered .
the very first time i saw you , harry , i recognized you immediately .
not by your scar , by your eyes .
they're your mother , lily's .
yes .
oh , yes .
i knew her .
your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was .
not only was she a singularly gifted witch ... ... she was also an uncommonly kind woman .
she had a way of seeing the beauty in others ... ... even , and most especially , when that person could not see it in themselves .
and your father , james , on the other hand ... ... he ...
he had a certain , shall we say , talent for trouble .
a talent , rumor has it , he passed on to you .
you're more like them than you know , harry .
in time , you'll come to see just how much .
honeyduke's sweetshop is brilliant , but nothing beats zonko's joke shop .
we never got to go to the shrieking shack .
you heard it's the most ...
haunted building in britain .
i know .
what's going on?
probably neville forgot the password again .
hey .
oh , you're there .
let me through , please .
excuse me !
i'm head boy !
get back , all of you .
no one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched .
the fat lady !
she's gone !
serves her right .
she was a terrible singer .
it's not funny , ron .
keep calm , everyone .
break into fours .
back to your common room .
be quiet .
make way .
the headmaster's here .
come on , move .
you heard .
move !
mr. filch?
round up the ghosts .
tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the fat lady .
there's no need for ghosts , professor .
the fat lady's there .
mind where you're going !
slow down !
you listen !
i'm head boy !
come back here !
keep moving !
dear lady , who did this to you?
eyes like the devil , he's got , and a soul as dark as his name .
it's him , headmaster .
the one they all talk about .
he's here , somewhere in the castle !
sirius black !
secure the castle , mr. filch .
the rest of you , to the great hall .
i've searched the astronomy tower and the owlery .
there's nothing there .
thank you .
the third floor's clear too , sir .
very good .
i've done the dungeons .
no sign of black , nor anywhere else in the castle .
i didn't really expect him to linger .
remarkable feat , don't you think?
to enter hogwarts castle on one's own ... ... completely undetected?
quite remarkable , yes .
any theories on how he managed it?
many .
each as unlikely as the next .
you may recall ... ... prior to the start of term i expressed concerns ... ... about your appointment of professor ...
not a single professor inside this castle would help sirius black enter it .
i'm quite convinced the castle is safe ... ... and i'm more than willing to send the students to their houses .
what about potter?
should he be warned?
perhaps .
but for now , let him sleep .
for in dreams , we enter a world that's entirely our own .
let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud .
turn to page 394 .
excuse me , sir .
where's professor lupin?
that's not really your concern , is it , potter?
suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching ... ... at the present time .
turn to page 394 .
werewolves "?
sir , we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks .
we're not meant to start that for weeks .
quiet .
when did she come in?
did you see her come in?
now , which one of you can tell me the difference ... ... between an animagus and a werewolf?
no one?
how disappointing .
please , sir .
an animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal .
a werewolf has no choice .
with each full moon ... ... he no longer remembers who he is .
he'd kill his best friend .
the werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind .
thank you , mr. malfoy .
that's the second time ... ... you've spoken out of turn , miss granger .
are you incapable of restraining yourself ... ... or do you take pride in being an insufferable know it all?
he's got a point , you know .
five points from gryffindor .
as an antidote to your ignorance , and on my desk , by monday morning ... ... two rolls of parchment on the werewolf , with emphasis ... ... on recognizing it .
it's quidditch tomorrow .
then i suggest you take extra care , mr. potter .
loss of limb will not excuse you .
page 394 .
the term " werewolf " ... ... is a contraction of the anglo saxon word " wer " ... ... which means " man , " and " wolf .
werewolf , man wolf .
there are several ways to become a werewolf .
they include being given the power of shape shifting ... ... being bitten by a werewolf ...
go , harry !
go , harry !
aresto momentum !
he looks a bit peaky , doesn't he?
peaky?
what do you expect?
he fell over 100 feet .
let's walk you off a tower and see what you look like .
probably a right sight better than he normally does .
how are you feeling?
oh , brilliant .
you gave us a right good scare .
what happened?
well , you fell off your broom .
really?
i meant the match .
who won?
no one blames you , harry .
dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds .
dumbledore's furious .
after he saved you , he sent them off .
there's something else you should know too .
when you fell , your broom sort of blew into the whomping willow , and ...
well ...
i'm sorry to hear about your broomstick .
is there no chance of fixing it?
no .
professor , why do the dementors affect me so?
i mean , more than everyone else?
listen .
dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth .
they feed on every good feeling , every happy memory ... ... until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences .
you are not weak , harry .
dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past .
horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine .
you have nothing to be ashamed of .
i'm scared , professor .
i'd consider you a fool if you weren't .
i need to know how to fight them .
you could teach me .
you made the one on the train go away .
there was only one that night .
but you made it go away .
i don't pretend to be an expert , harry .
but as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you ... ... perhaps i should teach you .
but after the holidays .
for now , i need to rest .
last call for hogsmeade !
come on , now !
guys , let me go .
clever , harry .
but not clever enough .
we've got a better way .
i'm trying to get to hogsmeade .
we know .
we'll get you there .
we'll show you a quicker way .
if you pipe down .
bless him .
let me go !
come on , guys .
don't ...
now , harry .
come and join the big boys .
what are you doing? !
what's this rubbish?
" what's this rubbish? " he says .
it's the secret to our success .
it's a wrench giving it to you ...
but we've decided your needs are greater than ours .
george , if you will .
i solemnly swear that i am up to no good .
messrs. moony , wormtail , padfoot and prongs ... ... are proud to present the marauder's map .
we owe them so much .
hang on .
this is hogwarts .
and that ...
no .
is that really ...?
dumbledore .
in his study .
pacing .
does that a lot .
so this map shows ...?
everyone .
where they are .
what they're doing .
every minute .
every day .
brilliant !
where did you get it?
from filch's office .
first year .
there are seven secret passageways ... ... out of the castle .
we'd recommend this one .
the one eyed witch passageway .
leads you to honeyduke's .
hurry .
filch is heading this way .
and don't forget .
when you're done , 00 : 58 : 14, 779 ... > 00 : 58 : 18, 936 " mischief managed .
otherwise , anyone can read it .
now , how much do you want?
delicious .
it's meant to be the most haunted building in britain .
did i mention that?
twice .
do you want to move a bit closer?
to the shrieking shack?
actually , i'm fine here .
well , well .
look who's here .
you two shopping for your new dream home?
bit grand for you , isn't it , weasle bee?
don't your family sleep in one room?
shut your mouth , malfoy .
not very friendly .
boys , i think it's time we teach weasle bee how to respect his superiors .
hope you don't mean yourself .
how dare you talk to me !
you filthy little mudblood !
who is that?
don't stand there !
do something !
what?
what's up , malfoy?
lost your skis?
get out of the way !

malfoy !
wait !
wait !
harry !
bloody hell , harry .
that was not funny .

never told me about any marauder's map .
he won't keep it .
he'll turn it over to professor mcgonagall .
aren't you?
sure .
along with his invisibility cloak .
look who it is .
madam rosmerta .
ron fancies her .
that's not true !
professor mcgonagall !
cornelius !
allow me , minister .
oh , hagrid ...
sorry about that .
rosmerta , my dear .
i hope business is good .
it'd be a lot better if the ministry wasn't sending dementors ...
