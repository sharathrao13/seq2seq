the film which you are about to see is an account of the tragedy which befell a group of 5 youths .
it is all the more tragic in that they were young , but had they lived very , very long lives , they could not have expected , nor would they have wished to see as much of the mad and macabre as they were to see that day .
for them , an idyilic summer afternoon became a nightmare .
for 30 years , the files collected dust in the cold cases division of the travis county police department .
over 1, 300 pieces of evidence were collected from the crime scene at the hewitt residence .
yet none of the evidence was more compelling than the classified police footage of the crime scene walk through .
test , test , test .
ok , uh ... this is august 20 , 1973 .
the time is 3 : 47 p . m .
our location is the hewitt residence on route 17 .
that's where victim one was found .
we're gonna do a walk through , and we're now descending the stairs into the furnace room .
uh ... there's ... over here .
there's scratch marks along the wall .
there's some more over here , right along here .
and ... oh , there's something over here .
it seems like ... it looks like a clot of hair and an embedded fingernail .
all right , we're gonna go move into the actual furnace room .
the events of that day were to lead to one of the most bizarre crimes in the annals of american history ... the texas chainsaw massacre .
hold on !
hold on !
don't let go !
not yet !
not yet !
yeah !
now !
now !

why the fuck did we have to stop?
she needed help !
a lot of fucking help we did her !
leave her alone .

i just don't understand .
why did she do it?
and why did she have to pick us?
why did she have to pick us?
what are we gonna do?
i don't know .
we're gonna ... we're gonna have to call the cops , i guess .
yeah , on the list of bad ideas , that one goes way up there .
are you kidding me?
oh , police officer , please , as you inspect the crime scene , which is now our van , please ignore the colorful pinata filled with marijuana you may just happen to come across , because it played no part whatsoever in the demise of this unfortunate young woman .
listen ... keep your goddamn voice down .
easy , easy , easy .
goddamn it .
well , you're not gonna listen to him .
what the fuck are you doing?
uh !
it's over , man .

i did it so we could start a life , you know .
i'm sorry .
ok?
well , i'll tell you this much ... there's no possible way i'm ever getting back in that van .
i guess that's what brains look like , huh?

i'll tell you this much ... the next hitchhiker is shit out of luck .
i swear to god .
dude , gas station .

let's find the bathroom .
well , i'll be damned .
ma'am , we need to report a suicide .
something like this comes along , it makes folks realize how crazy the world is out there .
right .
would you mind calling the sheriff , ma'am?
it's gonna cost you 10 cents .
you want some pig?
big brothers .
i just feel so disgusting .
oh , there's about 6 of them altogether , counting the dead one .
poor thing .
it's awful .
well , why don't you ask them yourself?
right .
where did you say you found her again?
ma'am , i already told you .
about 10 minutes west of here .
about 5 miles west .
ma'am , excuse me .
when is the sheriff gonna be here?
sheriff said he's headed over to the old crawford mill .
i'm sorry .
the what?
the old crawford mill .
he wants to know if you wouldn't mind driving over there to make your report .
yes .
yes , we goddamn mind .
i'm sorry , but how often do girls just blow their heads off in this shit hole town?
all right , just calm down , ok?
let me ... i'm sorry .
i apologize .
but , ma'am , i don't understand .
why the hell won't the sheriff just come out here?
didn't say .
he said it would be about 2 hours before he could get here .
we're not gonna drive around this town with a dead girl in the back of our van !
young man ... what you do is your own business .
come on .
get in .
i just want to go home , ok?
that's fine .
it's starting to stink back here .
no worse than the inside of that fucking store .
did you smell that nasty beef shit?
oh , my god .
guys .
hello !
hello?
ain't no sheriff here .
i think we should drop off the body and get the hell out of here .
maybe we should vote on it .
kemper , no .
why not , erin?
it is a democracy .
well , how would you like it if we just dumped your body out here?
i'm sorry .
nobody asked her to blow her head off in our van .
my van .
i say we dump her .
pig .
cool .
all right .
fine .
2 votes .
now we just need one more .
kemper?
one more and we're out of here .
kemper , please?
baby , she's dead .
i just ... i really don't think it matters where we leave her .
well , it matters to me ... if that means anything .
erin , look ... that girl has got parents out there somewhere who's gonna want her back , not just dumped on the side of the road
like a piece of trash .
you see our lone ranger anywhere?
maybe this isn't the crawford mill .
it's unbelievable .
this is a joke .
there's nobody here .
there's no sheriff here .
what?
i just saw something move in there .
i just saw something .
i swear to god , i just saw something move in there .
you're just trying to scare me into leaving .
erin , come on .
go to hell .
erin , come on .
quit screwing around .
aah !
kemper !
erin !
erin !
erin , where are you?
all right .

if somebody's out there , just stop fucking around , all right?
i mean it !
just come on out !
who are you?
what did you do to her?
huh?
the girl out there , in the van .
we didn't do anything to her .
