carl? for those of us who are unfamiliar with bank fraud
you may telling us what the hell you are talking about the east coast branches , at number 01 the 06 , ... 07 and 08 so one so far
minus numbers on the bottom of the checks actually means something
all this was in the report i filed two days ago
