elena , how nice to see you again .
what a wonderful surprise to meet you here !
you're looking wonderful .
thank you .
you're looking well , too .
this is my good friend , dr. heywood floyd .
i'd like you to meet dr. kalinan .
how do you do?
dr. stretyneva .
how do you do?
and this is dr. andrei smyslov .
how do you do?
i've heard a lot about you .
won't you sit down?
well , we  no , no , please .
well , thank you .
would you like a drink , doctor?
no , thank you .
i haven't had breakfast yet .
someone's meeting me in the restaurant .
i'll just sit with you a few minutes and then i must be off .
are you quite sure?
i'm quite sure , thank you .
and how's gregor?
he's fine .
he's been doing some underwater research in the baltic so ... ... l'm afraid we don't get a chance to see very much of each other these days .
when you do see him , give him my regards , huh?
yes , of course .
well , where are you all off to?
up or down?
oh , we're going home .
we have just spent three months calibrating the new antennae at tchalinko .
and what about you?
i'm just on my way up to clavius .
oh , are you?
dr. floyd , i hope you don't think i'm being too inquisitive , but ... ... perhaps you can clear up the great big mystery ... ... about what is going on up there .
i'm afraid i don't know what you mean .
oh , it's just that for the past two weeks ... ... some extremely odd things have been happening at clavius .
oh , really?
yes , yes .
for one thing , whenever you phone the base all you get is a recording which ... ... repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order .
probably having some trouble with their equipment or something like that .
that's what we thought was the explanation at first ... ... but it has been going on now for the past ten days .
you have not been able to contact anyone for the past ten days?
that's right .
oh , i see .
and there's another thing , heywood .
two days ago , one of our rocket buses was denied permission ... ... for an emergency landing at clavius .
that does sound odd .
yes , yes .
i'm afraid there's going to be a bit of a row about that .
denying the men permission to land is a direct violation of the i. a. s. convention .
yes , of course .
of course .
did the crew get back all right?
yes , fortunately they did .
well , i'm glad about that .
at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss ... ... may i ask you a straightforward question?
well , certainly .
quite frankly , we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that ... ... quite a serious epidemic has broken out on clavius .
something , apparently , of an unknown origin .
ls this , in fact , what has happened?
i'm sorry , dr. smyslov , but ... ... l'm really not at liberty to discuss this .
i understand .
but this epidemic could quite easily spread to our base .
we should be given all the facts , dr. floyd .
yes , i know .
as i said , i'm not at liberty to discuss it .
now , are you sure you won't change your mind about that drink?
no , i'm positive .
now , i really must be going .
i hope that you and your wife can come to the i. a. c. conference in june .
we're gonna try .
hope we can make it .
and if you do , you remember to bring that darling little daughter with you !
well , that will all depend on school vacations and all that sort of thing .
but if we can , we will .
don't forget you have a standing invitation if you ever get to the states .
no , of course not .
gregor and i will look forward to seeing you .
well , goodbye , elena .
it has been a pleasure meeting you all , dr. smyslov .
whatever the reasons for your visit to clavius , the very best of luck to you .
thank you .
ladies .
excuse me , dr. halvorsen .
i'm through now .
thank you very much , gentlemen .
you're welcome .
well ....
i know you will all want to join with me in welcoming our ... ... distinguished friend and colleague ... ... from the national council of astronautics , dr. heywood floyd .
dr. floyd has come up specially to calvius to be with us today .
and before the briefing i know he'd like to have a few words with you .
dr. floyd?
thank you , dr. halvorsen .
hi , everybody .
nice to be back again .
first of all , i bring a personal message from dr. howell who ... ... has asked me to convey his deepest appreciation to all of you ... ... for the many sacrifices you have had to make .
and , of course , his congratulations on your discovery ... ... which may well prove to be among the most significant in the history of science .
now ... ... i know there have been some conflicting views held by some of you ... ... regarding the need for complete security in this matter .
more specifically , your opposition to the cover story ... ... created to give the impression that there is an epidemic at the base .
i understand that beyond it being a matter of principle ... ... many of you are troubled by the concern and anxiety ... ... this story of an epidemic might cause to your relatives and friends on earth .
well , i completely sympathize with your negative views .
i find this cover story personally embarrassing myself .
however , i accept the need for absolute secrecy in this .
and i hope you will , too .
now , i'm sure you are all aware of the extremely grave potential ... ... for cultural shock and social disorientation ... ... contained in this present situation ... ... if the facts were prematurely and suddenly made public ... ... without adequate preparation and conditioning .
anyway , this is the view of the council .
the purpose of my visit here is to gather additional facts and opinions ... ... on the situation ... ... and to prepare a report to the council ... ... recommending when and how ... ... the news should eventually be announced .
now , if any of you would like to give me your views and opinions ... ... in private if you like , i will be only too happy to include them in my report .
well , i think that's about it .
any questions?
dr. floyd , have you any idea how much longer this cover story ... ... will have to be maintained?
i don't know , bill .
i suppose it will be maintained as long as is deemed necessary by the council .
there must be adequate time for a full study to be made on the situation ... ... before any thought can be given to making a public announcement .
oh , yes , as some of you already know , the council has requested ... ... that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing ... ... from everyone who has any knowledge of this event .
are there any more questions?
i'm sure we all want to cooperate with dr. floyd as fully as possible ... ... and as there seems to be no more questions ... ... i think we ought to get on with the briefing .
thank you , dr. floyd .
thank you .
anybody hungry?
what we've got?
you name it .
what's this?
chicken?
something like that .
tastes the same , anyway .
any ham?
ham , ham , ham ....
looks pretty good .
they're getting better at it all the time .
that was an excellent speech you gave us , heywood .
it certainly was .
i'm sure it beefed up morale a hell of a lot .
thanks , ralph .
i want to say to both of you that i think you've done a wonderful job .
i appreciate the way you've handled this thing .
well , the way we look at it , it's our job to do this thing the way you want it done .
and we're only too happy to be able to oblige .
have you seen these yet?
take a look at them .
here's what started the whole thing .
oh , yes .
when we first found it , we thought it might be an outcrop of magnetic rock ... ... but all the geological evidence was against it .
and not even a big nickel iron meteorite could produce a field as intense as this .
so , we decided to have a look .
we thought it might be the upper part of some buried structure ... ... so we excavated out on all sides .
but , unfortunately , we didn't find anything else .
and what's more , the evidence seems pretty conclusive that ... ... it has not been covered up by natural erosion or other forces .
it seems to have been deliberately buried .
deliberately buried .
how about a little coffee?
great .
good idea .
i don't suppose you have any idea what the damn thing is , huh?
i wish to hell we did .
no , the only thing we're sure of is it was buried four million years ago .
well , i must say , you guys have certainly come up with something .
good evening .
three weeks ago , the american spacecraft , discovery one ... ... left on its half billion mile voyage to jupiter .
this marked the first manned attempt to reach this distant planet .
earlier this afternoon , " the world tonight " recorded an interview ... ... with the crew of discovery at a distance of 80 million miles from earth .
it took seven minutes for our words to reach the giant spacecraft ... ... but this time delay has been edited from this recording .
our reporter , martin amer , speaks to the crew .
the crew of discovery one consists of five men ... ... and one of the latest generation of the hal 9000 computers .
three of the five men were put aboard asleep ... ... or to be more precise , in a state of hibernation .
they were dr. charles hunter , dr. jack kimball and dr. victor kaminsky .
we spoke with mission commander , dr. david bowman ... ... and his deputy , dr. frank poole .
well , good afternoon , gentlemen .
how is everything going?
marvelous .
we have no ... we have no complaints .
well , lm very glad to hear that and lm sure that the entire world ... ... would join me in wishing you a safe and successful voyage .
thanks very much .
thank you .
although hibernation has been used on previous space efforts ... ... this is the first time that men have been put into hibernation before departure .
why was this done?
well , this was done in order to achieve the maximum conservation ... ... of our life support capabilities , basically food and air .
now , the three hibernating crew members represent the survey team .
and their efforts wont be utilized until we are approaching jupiter .
dr. poole , whats it like while you are in hibernation?
lts exactly like being asleep ; you have absolutely no sense of time .
the only difference is you dont dream .
as i understand it , you only breathe once a minute .
ls this true?
thats right .
and your heart beats three times a minute , body temperature is usually down ... ... to about three degrees centigrade .
the sixth member of the discovery crew was not concerned ... ... about the problems of hibernation .
for he was the latest result in machine intelligence .
the hal 9000 computer which can reproduce ... ... though some experts still prefer to use the word " mimic " ... ... most of the activities of the human brain and with incalculably greater speed ... ... and reliability .
we next spoke with the hal 9000 computer ... ... whom , we learned , one addresses as hal .
good afternoon , hal .
hows everything going?
good afternoon , mr. amer .
everythings going extremely well .
hal , you have an enormous responsibility on this mission .
ln many ways , perhaps the greatest responsibility ... ... of any single mission element .
you are the brain and central nervous system of the ship .
your responsibilities include watching over the men in hibernation .
does this ever cause you any lack of confidence?
let me put it this way , mr. amer .
the 9000 series is the most reliable computer ever made .
no 9000 computer has ever made a mistake or distorted information .
we are all by any practical definition of the words ... ... foolproof and incapable of error .
hal , despite your enormous intellect , are you ever frustrated ... ... by your dependence on people to carry out actions?
not in the slightest bit .
i enjoy working with people .
i have a stimulating relationship with dr. poole and dr. bowman .
my mission responsibilities range over the entire operation of the ship ... ... so i am constantly occupied .
i am putting myself to the fullest possible use ... ... which is all , i think , that any conscious entity can ever hope to do .
dr. poole , whats it like living for the better part of a year ... ... in such close proximity with hal?
lts pretty close to what you said about him earlier .
hes just like the sixth member of the crew .
you very quickly get adjusted to the idea that he talks .
you think of him ... ... really as just another person .
ln talking to the computer one gets the sense that he is capable ... ... of emotional response .
for example , when i asked him about his abilities ... ... i sensed a certain pride in his answer about his accuracy and perfection .
do you believe that hal has genuine emotions?
oh , yes .
well , he acts like he has genuine emotions .
of course , hes programmed that way to make it easier for us to talk to him .
but , as to whether or not he has real feelings ... ... is something i dont think anyone can truthfully answer .
ex cuse me , frank .
what is it , hal?
weve got the transmission from your parents coming in .
put it on here , please .
take me in a bit .
certainly .
hello , frank .
happy birthday , darling .
happy birthday .
many happy returns of the day .
a bit higher , please .
now , mother and i are both feeling wonderful , too .
ray and sally were going to be here , too ... ... but at the last minute rays back went bad on him again .
how do you like your cake , dear?
looks great , doesnt it?
sorry you cant be with us .
oh , i ran into bob the other day .
he said to be sure and wish you a happy birthday .
all my students made me promise to send their best wishes , too .
you know they talk about you all the time in the classroom .
youre a big celebrity in the second grade .
you know we were on television last week?
oh , yes !
your mother and i and daves parents were interviewed ... ... about what we thought of our illustrious son .
you can imagine what we told them .
i think its being broadcast next thursday .
perhaps youll be able to listen in .
oh , we were thrilled about elaine and bill , dear .
lil be glad to get the present for you , but please tell me how much to spend .
oh , yes , frank , about your ags 19 payments
i think i straightened it out for you .
i talked to the accounting office in houston yesterday ... ... and they said you should be receiving your higher rates of pay by next month .
well , i cant think of anything else to say .
oh , our love to dave .
be sure to give him our best regards .
we wish you the very happiest of birthdays .
all the best , son .
see you next wednesday .
happy birthday , frank .
thank you , hal .
a bit flatter , please .
