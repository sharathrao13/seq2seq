a case to end all cases .
you know what i mean , dinah?
i used to think being a private detective was cool .
like sam spade or phillip marlowe , right?
but there's nothing cool left to it .
on top of that , both my fridge and my bank account are empty .
wait .
okay , dinah , let's bet .
if it's another suspicious husband , i'm out of this business forever .
hello?
mr. ash , i have a job for you .
and you need me to check on your wife , right?
i'm looking for a computer hacker .
this hacker goes by the alias trinity .
that's all we know .
well , it looks like we're still in business , dinah .
fine .
and who will i be working for?
i can't say .
you can't say .
call me back when you can say .
that's not the way i do business .
it was a pleasure chatting with you .
before you hang up , take a look at your bank account balance .
i didn't get a good feeling about the case .
but i had no good reason to turn the guy down now .
this trinity was well known in hacker circles .
a real artist by the sound of it .
the cops were always one step behind him .
so i knew i could get that close .
question was , could i get closer?
i had a few tricks up my sleeve for getting to hackers .
while i was searching , i found something strange .
other detectives had been on the case too .
and their investigations had all been , shall we say , troubled .
one of the guys killed himself .
another had disappeared .
another went crazy .
so i paid the one who was left a visit .
the crazy one .
trinity doesn't exist , man .
he's not real .
he's a figment .
a cipher .
a jabberwocky .
and who am i?
who the hell am i?
did i mention he was crazy?
chessboards , jabberwocky , red queen ...
i started searching all the usual hacker hangouts ... ... for someone with an alice in wonderland m . o .
hacker bulletin boards , anonymous mailboxes , chat rooms .
and it was in one of those that i picked up trinity's trail .
six brooks .
i'll be there at 2005 .
of course !
crossing the second brook takes her into the woods .
alice jumps the first brook ... ... and ...
and then she boards a train .
thanks .
excuse me .
hey !
hey !
i knew this was some kind of trap .
there's a difference , mr. ash , between a trap and a test .
you were testing me?
you made it .
i'm impressed .
flattery will get you everywhere .
i'm not here to flatter you , i'm here to save you .
what just happened?
mr. ash , dream of having an eye exam lately?
yeah , how'd you know?
you've stepped to the edge of the looking glass .
so then , that means i wasn't dreaming .
they hired me as a way of getting to you , didn't they?
go !
what the hell is going on here?
this is really crazy .
now i understand what happened to those other detectives .
they went nuts .
what are you doing?
what are you doing , guys?
well , i've gotten out of worse jams than this .
i am not gonna let them get you .
what's happening to me?
i'm sorry .
you didn't make it , mr. ash .
i wish ... ... i could go with you .
i don't blame you , you know .
everything that happened , trinity , it was all my fault .
all that through the looking glass stuff .
can't get my head around it .
i'm old fashioned .
there's a difference between a test and a choice .
for what it's worth , i think you could've handled the truth .
it was just a job .
goodbye , trinity .
goodbye .
a case to end all cases .
