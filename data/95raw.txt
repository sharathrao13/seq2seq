leonard adkins is in a warmer clime ... .. with a story that grows hotter by the minute .
security was tight today at escalan airport in valverde , ... .. where government authorities report ... .. that deposed general ramon esperanza ... .. will be delivered for extradition to the united states .
only two years ago , general esperanza ... .. led his country's army in a campaign against communist insurgents , ... .. a campaign fought with american money and advisers .
esperanza's fall from power caused ripples ... .. in his country's recent election , and closer to home as well , ... .. when high ranking pentagon officials were charged ... .. with supplying him with weapons despite the congressional ban .
evidence that esperanza's forces ... .. violated the neutrality of neighboring countries ... .. made congress withhold funds .
esperanza is accused of replacing the funds ...
.. by cocaine smuggling .
although esperanza was removed as commander in chief this year , ... .. the agreement to extradite him was only reached yesterday .
washington insiders say a phone call made it happen , ... .. a phone call from a ...
all right , all right .
if i could find a phone , i'd call you , whoever you are .
bye .
excuse me .
thank you .
this is lieutenant mcclane .
somebody there beep me?
i'd like to think i'm somebody .
honey !
where are you?
did you land yet?
it's the nineties , remember?
microchips , microwaves , faxes , air phones .
as far as i'm concerned , progress peaked with frozen pizza .
listen , um , we're going to be about half an hour late landing , ok?
i just wanted to let you know .
the kids ok?
they'll lose their minds from all the sugar your parents give them .
did mom give you a hard time about borrowing her new car?
no .
not yet .
listen , honey , when you land , can we just , like , you know , ... .. rent a car , check into a hotel , leave the kids with your parents?
order some room service?
a bottle of champagne , what do you say?
you're on , lieutenant .
i'll see you in about half an hour , honey .
i love you .
bye .
isn't technology wonderful?
my husband doesn't think so .
well , i do .
i used to carry around those awful mace things .
now ...
i zap any bastard that screws with me .
i tried it on my little dog .
poor thing limped for a week .
excuse me .
well , you look really familiar to me .
i get that a lot .
i've been on tv .
yeah .
me , too .
grab the tools , will you?
you got it .
this is amy nichole , live from escalan airport , ... .. where deposed general ramon esperanza ... .. has just arrived under heavy guard .
the deposed dictator's mood seems jubilant .
he is waving to the crowd , ...
.. as if running for political office .
.. thousands of political prisoners , including the new president .
there's no doubt he still has ... .. some ardent supporters both here and abroad .
rumors abound on capitol hill that there were ...
yeah?
sir , we're checking our equipment .
any problems with the conduit line?
i don't know anything about that .
would you mind if we take a look?
help yourself .
it don't seem right somehow , closing down this church .
the parish is going to keep on using it , but it won't be the same .
been here a lot of years , and i've been right here with it .
yeah , i kind of feel like ... .. a piece of me is dying with this church .
well , you're right about that .
.. cocaine smuggling and bribing government officials .
he certainly doesn't show it , ... .. but no matter how high his spirits , ... .. they can't hide the fact that the us war on drugs has taken its first prisoner .
this is buckwheat .
the clubhouse is open .
here at dulles , the quiet men from the justice department ... .. will handcuff the man who symbolizes the enemy ... .. in america's fight against cocaine .
that battle may be almost won , but the war is still in doubt .
samantha coleman , wntw , for night time news .

is there a reason for that?
just routine .

old news .

damn it !
excuse me .
excuse me .
thank you .
hey , man .
what is it?
you got a key for this door?
yeah .

going to work overtime .
good idea .
ok , hold that end .

all right .
perfect .
perfect .
good to go .
hey !
it's a restricted area .
what's the matter?
couldn't wait for the skycap?
we work here .
let's see some id .
sure .
no problem .
oh , jeez .

what is this , a tag team?
agh !
you say he came in here and flashed a badge?
yeah .
he said to bring you guys back here .
ugh !
agh !
aagh !
aagh !
aagh !

freeze !
nice guess , asshole .
i'm a cop .
that was the bad guy .
where's your id?
on its way to cleveland?
no , you did not explain anything .
you just shoved me back here into this cattle car .
sir , you were told we were overbooked .
fine .
done .
i accept that .
but why can't i get the first class meal my network paid for?
do you know who i am?
yes .
we've seen your program .
your episode , flying junk yards , was an objective look at air traffic safety .
it wasn't nearly as edifying as bimbos of the sky , was it , connie?
you think you're funny .
you think you're funny .
fine .
i've got your number .
and i've got yours .
so park it , sir .
fine .
stewardess .
mr thornberg , ... .. you cannot monopolies my time .
you cannot put me near that woman .
excuse me?
he means he's filed a restraining order against me .
i'm not allowed within 50 feet of him .
50 yards .
so by keeping me in this section , you are violating a court order .
i can sue you and this airline .
that woman assaulted me , and she humiliated me in public .
what did you do?
knocked out two of his teeth .
would you like some champagne?
sorry , officer mcclane .
i had to check .
here's your piece and shield back .
thanks .
over here , officer !
we understand that there was shooting . .. the presence of justice department officials?
jesus !
what the fuck are you people ...
what are you doing?
this is a crime scene .
you got to seal this area off .
that's up to the captain .
maybe you better take me up to the captain , then , huh?
where's cochrane?
he didn't make it .
you're late .
we ran into trouble , colonel .
some cop ... killed cochrane .
i barely got away , sir .
did you accomplish your mission?
yes , sir , but ...
cochrane , sir .
well , then the damage is minimal .
the penalty could be severe .
you fail me again , and the chamber won't be empty .
dismissed .
miss .
miss .
i can't find my dog .
miss .
my dog .
one minute , ma'am .
i want you to fill out this form .
who is it?
come in .
captain lorenzo?
yeah .
i'm john mcclane ...
yeah , i know who you are .
you're the asshole that just broke seven faa and five district regulations ... .. running around my airport with a gun , shooting at people .
what do you call that shit?
self defense .
what , you think that la badge ... .. is going to get you a free lunch or something around here?
maybe a little professional courtesy .
huh !
in an airport on christmas week?
you've got to be kidding .
ok , fuck courtesy .
how about being professional?
your boys just walked away from a crime scene .
you can't wrap this up in ten minutes .
you got to seal the area off , dust for prints ...
hey , don't lecture me , hotshot .
i know what i'm doing .
we're going to dust it down .
we'll take all the pictures .
we'll sweep for fibres .
when will you do this?
after 400 people go through?
you'd be lucky to get a print from one of your people .
shut down that area ...
oh , shut the area down .
it's that simple , huh?
just shut the area down?
yeah , and i got everybody from the shriners 'convention ... .. to the goddamn boy scouts in here !
i got lost kids , lost dogs ...
not now !
later !
i got international diplomats .
i got a fucking reindeer flying in here from the fucking petting zoo !
but john mcclane , he's got a little problem .
let's shut down the whole fucking airport !
what do you think they'll say upstairs when i tell them that?
phone and find out .
i don't need fucking forensics to tell me this was some punk stealing luggage !
luggage?
that punk pulled a glock 7 on me .
that's a porcelain gun made in germany .
it doesn't show up on airport x ray machines ... .. and costs more than you make in a month .
you'd be surprised what i make in a month .
if it's more than $1 . 98 ...
hey , mcclane , don't start believing your own press , huh?
yeah , i know all about you and that nakatomi thing in la .
but just because the tv thinks you're hot shit , that don't make it so .
look , you are in my little pond now , ... .. and i am the big fish that runs it .
so you capped some lowlife .
fine .
i'll send your fucking captain in la a fucking commendation !
now , get the hell out of my office ... .. before i have you thrown out of my goddamn airport !
hey , carmine , let me ask you something .
what sets off the metal detectors first : the lead in your ass or the shit in your brains?
fat fuck .
any id on this guy?
that's somebody else's problem .
your car's ready .
sign right here .
i need to borrow this and this .
i'll bring it right back .
hey !
hey !
yo !

pretty gruesome fucking job .
all the confusion in there , forgot to get this clown's prints .
ew !
christ .
you're supposed to do that at the morgue .
not anymore .
got a new sop for doas from the faa .
i don't think this one's going to make it .
thanks a lot .
powell here .
take that twinkie out of your mouth and grab a pencil .
hey , john , how are you doing?
holly stood me up a day and i'm here alone in dc ... .. with my in laws .
eh , the old in laws , huh?
they do love their policemen son in laws .
listen , al , what is the fax machine number there at the station?
uh ... 555 3212 .
3212 .
hold on a second , all right?
i want to send you something .
excuse me .
you and faxes?
this is a first .
holly told me i should wake up and smell the nineties .
this way?
no .
that way .
wait .
it's upside down .
it doesn't matter .
ok , here it comes .
i'm sending you something now .
hold on a second , cowboy .
fingerprints?
we've got an unidentified stiffs here .
i've circled the whorls in pen in case the transmission's fuzzy .
run it through state and federal , and if you can , interpol .
will do .
well , what's this about?
oh , just a feeling i have .
ouch .
when you get those feelings , insurance companies start to go bankrupt .
listen , the , uh , fax number is ...
on the top of the transmission ...
on the top of the transmission you just got .
oh , an airport , huh?
you're not pissing in somebody's pool , are you?
yeah , and i'm fresh out of chlorine .
just as this storm starts breaking , ... .. the satellite will feed up and drop the other shoe .
look at this new front moving in .
makes its baby brother look like chicken shit .
i can sand down the runway and run the ploughs between landings ... .. if you downshift them , give me time to work .
you got it .
all right , everyone .
let's slow down our birds before we get a parking lot over our heads .
the line starts at the mississippi , ... .. and they better start taking numbers .
can i get you another?
no , thank you .
i only have to look at his face for another 20 minutes .
ladies and gentlemen , this is the captain speaking .
i've just been informed by dulles traffic control ... .. that there's a weather front ahead of us .
we may be up here a little while longer .
thank you .
on second thoughts ...
al?
hey , i'm right here , partner .
your stiffs dossier is coming through now .
what can you tell me about him?
he's dead .
you needed a computer to figure that out?
no , no .
you don't follow me .
according to the department of defense , he's been dead for two years .
what?
that's right .
sergeant oswald cochrane .
american adviser in honduras .
killed in a helicopter accident 5 11 88 .
officer .
read between the lines , and i'd say it looks like a lot of black bag stuff .
yeah , i see it .
all right , al .
thanks a lot .
hey , any time .
ok .
say , i close in about an hour .
maybe we can go get a drink?
just the fax , ma'am .
just the fax .
hey , wait a second .
i see somebody .
i'll call you back .
the ghost of christmas past .
nakatomi?
la?
you're john mcclane , right?
who are you?
sam coleman .
wntw news .
excuse me .
give me a break .
i saw the stiff .
word is that was your handiwork .
no .
i only do needlepoint .
great .
national just shut down .
totally iced .
they'll send us their planes .
happy , happy holiday .
the worst part , mr trudeau , was the press .
they were here for the esperanza story , ... .. so they got it right on the fucking news , bloodstains and all .
i'd like to lock every damn reporter out of the airport , ... .. but they'd pull that freedom of speech crap on us .
then the aclu would be all over us .
murder on television .
hell of a start for christmas week .
what is it?
a gang thing like last time?
only if your gangs get their training at fort bragg .
who the hell is this?
uh uh , mcclane .
i'm a police officer ...
in an unauthorized area .
la , mr trudeau , don't mean shit .
that's what i said about my last cholesterol test .
so what's your problem , lieutenant mcclane?
i'm sure captain lorenzo explained ... .. the minor fracas with the minor thieves .
maybe he can explain this .
all systems tapped , colonel .
fire it up .
h minus five minutes .
stand by .
ok , we've got a body in the morgue that seems to have died twice .
assuming it's not a computer error , what do we assume?
that somebody's about to fuck with this airport .
what the hell is that supposed to mean?
i know we're dummies up here , so give us a taste of your genius .
this is a hijacking , a robbery or what?
look , i'm not sure ...
oh , he's not sure .
i'm stunned
i got to lie down .
only professionals go to this much trouble .
not luggage thieves and not punks .
professional at what?
what the fuck do you think this is?
the safety patrol?
this is the resume? of a professional mercenary .
the world's biggest drug dealer is due here .
you need a slide rule to solve this , ... .. or another body in a bag before you ask questions?
you're the one that gave us that fucking body .
remember that .
yeah , i remember that .
lorenzo , have all your shift commanders report in .
now .
you're not buying into this? !
they're to report anything unusual , however trivial .
got that?
yeah , i got it .
oh , my god !
what?
the runways .
what the hell?
they're shutting down .
jesus christ .
go to emergency lighting now .
emergency .
we are in a code yellow .
backup systems won't come up .
shunt to another terminal .
bobby , what have you got?
nothing .
the network is down .
should we call the power company?
we're on the same goddamn grid .
we're hot .
dulles , what's going on?
i'm on approach .
maintain position .
repeat .
what's going on down there?
roger .
we're on it .
we're unable right now .
delay .
fuji 604 .
execute published missed approach procedure and hold .
twa 23 , unable to clear you for approach at this time .
climb to and maintain one zero thousand .
i've checked all systems .
it ain't happening .
yeah , yeah , yeah ...
what's it look like?
approach control , it's gone .
jesus !
instrument landing system is down .
confirmed .
ils is dead .
every goddamn system's dead .
and inmac monitors are down .
attention all controllers .
attention .
we have a code red alert .
every aircraft approaching our sector ... .. and not already in our landing pattern ... .. gets diverted to their alternate airport .
everyone already on approach or inside our pattern ... .. holds at the outer markers .
stack 'em , pack 'em , and rack 'em .
move .
get someone on it !
all right .
not a word of this leaves this room .
there must be 15, 000 people in this airport , ... .. and we don't need panic .
we just bought ourselves maybe two hours .
after that , planes low on fuel won't be circling .
they'll be dropping on the white house lawn .
mcclane , is this what you expected?
no .
this is just the beginning .
faa hot line .
how could they know already?
they can't .
maybe it's the boys who pulled your plugs .
put it on speaker .
attention , dulles tower .
attention .
they say blind men become very attentive by way of compensation .
now that you're blind and deaf , i think i've got your attention .
i'm aware your recorders are active , so i'll be quick .
you can play me back later to your heart's content .
how did you get on this line?
who is this?
who i am is unimportant .
what i want ...
well , if you don't want those planes to start splashing into the potomac ... .. as they run out of fuel , what i want is very important .
a plane will be landing at this airport in 58 minutes .
foreign military one .
i'm sure you are aware of the nature ...
esperanza? .. of this flight , the importance of its cargo .
this plane will not be met by anyone .
it will land on a runway of my designation , ... .. where it will remain isolated and unapproached .
that will conclude my interest in this aircraft ... .. and your responsibility for it .
at the same time , i want a 747 cargo conversion , ... .. fully fueled ... .. and placed at my disposal .
you have two more minutes to advise inbound aircraft ... .. to hold at their outer radio marker .
after that , you will be able to receive only .
any attempt to restore your systems , will be met ... .. by severe penalties .
he's bluffing .
damn it , you can't do this .
i am doing this .
ok , listen up .
i need you to punch up a code 15 .
i got an idea , and i need your help .
if esperanza gets to a country ... .. with no extradition treaties , we're fucked .
they're talking to us on our own system .
they got to be close .
my men will tear this airport apart .
just in the nick of time , huh?
i got a first class unit here , swat team and all .
we don't need any monday morning quarterbacks .
my wife's on one of the planes they're fucking with !
so i'm on the playing field .
if you'd have moved your fat ass before , we wouldn't be deep in shit now .
that's it .
security .
you're out of here .
mr trudeau , there are faa regulations ... .. regarding unauthorized personnel in the control tower !
we just have to find a way to transmit .
somebody want to run to radio shack for a transmitter?
we have one the terminal wing they're building .
20 airlines when it's done , ... .. all with reservation computers in a nice antenna arrangement .
see mr mcclane out .
you got no business being up here .
everything we need is by the annexe skywalk ... .. just sitting there , waiting to go on line .
goddamn it , trudeau , you're dealing with pros .
you can't fuck with these people !
sam coleman .
wntw news .
there are a lot of rumors flying around .
no way .
no way , lady .
hell , no .
no .
this is off limits , coleman .
get them out of here !
anything you can think of , they'll think of , too !
get your fucking hands off me .
just get them out of here .
lobby security , ...
.. come in .
tomalson here .
this is captain lorenzo .
we've two unauthorized personnel in the tower .
would you get your thumb out of your ass?
get them out of the elevator , or you'll get a pink slip for christmas .
10 4 .
let's go .
goddamn !
anything who can think of?
can't fuck with who?
shit .
hang on over there .
what for?
just hang on !
big drug dealer on his way to prison .
gunfight at airport .
every controller in the coffee shop getting beeped , ... .. and you rocking the boat .
connection?
come on , mcclane .
just a few words .
ok , just a few words .
fuck off .
thanks , but i already got that from colonel stuart .
stuart .
the guy that got canned by congress .
that's who he was .
who he who?
what?
hey ...
shh !
it's ok , i've done this before .
hey .
hi .
where's the other one?
claustrophobic , i guess .
it's a vhf system , but the planes are so close , it's ok .
i can rig our frequency in 30 minutes , and wire in a crossover .
even the planes wouldn't know the difference .
get what you need .
borrow .
steal .
kill .
i want my swat team to go with him as cover .
whatever we can think of , they can think of , too .
oh , man .
i can't fucking believe this .
another basement .
another elevator .
how can the same shit happen to the same guy twice?
# old cape cod
# if you like the taste of a lobster stew
# served by a window with an ocean view
# you're sure to fall in love with old cape cod
who are you?
i'm marvin .
marvin .
i'm marvin .
i thought you was trying to steal my records .
i'm just the janitor .
this is dulles approach to all aircraft ... .. holding at potomac vortex .
we are experiencing some technical problems .
weather conditions , which have deteriorated ... .. have now been complicated by an unforeseen human factor .
this has affected all of our electronic equipment ... .. and their redundant backups .
as a result , our nav and approach systems are down .
we expect to lose voice in another minute .
we want you to continue ... .. holding at the outer marker as directed ... .. and wait for further instructions .
as soon as we're back on line , ... .. we'll expedite your landings on a fuel emergency basis .
good luck .
god bless .
ok , change the boards .
hey , stand back .
the skywalk annexe .
no !
the annexe skywalk .
it's the last thing i heard before they kicked me out .
well , let me see here , now .
well , this must be it right there .
see?
that's the raised platform and there's the new terminal .
there's your skywalk .
goddamn bottleneck .
nice place for an ambush .
what's the fastest way you can get me out to that spot?
this kind of thing wasn't in my job description .
mr barnes , we'll watch your back .
yeah?
who watches yours?
main ventilation duct .
ventilation duct ... .. and bingo .
just once , ... .. i'd like a regular , normal christmas .
eggnog , a fucking christmas tree , ... .. a little turkey .
but , no !
i got to crawl around in this motherfucking tin can !
we're in the annexe skywalk .
i can see the array .
i'll give you a call for a protocol test when it's hot .
that's all for now .
sergeant , we need more equipment .
i'd like to send one of your guys for it .
right , sir .
you got it .
what the hell?
what the hell's going on?
hey !
put that back on !
hey , asshole , what do i look like to you?
a sitting duck .
take him !
shit !
damn it .
i hate it when i'm right .
look out !
get down !
aagh !
aagh !
stay down !
fuck !
come on .
fucking son of a bitch .
aagh !
shit .
agh !
ugh !
i'm going to kick your fucking ass .
jeez .
you all right?
yeah .
but the antenna array , ...
i got to get to it and set it up .
get down !
bait .
jerk us off .
make lorenzo sacrifice his best men .
make you waste your time , ... .. time we don't have .
i think you're closer than 50 yards .
so's that airplane .
practically .
yeah .
there's quite a few of them .
it looks like a regular traffic jam .
there's nothing regular about it .
see?
you're intrigued .
that's my gift , mrs mcclane .
i notice things .
things other people wouldn't see .
that's how i make people curious .
don't you mean nauseous?
look .
the people have a right to know everything about everybody .
you got in the way of that .
listen , buster .
you endangered my children .
you didn't do it for anything as noble as the people .
the only time you see the people , ... .. is when you look down to see what you're stepping on .
me?
yeah , i'll live .
but lorenzo's swat team is dead , ... .. and the antenna array is gone .
didn't you see it? !
it's hard looking for a new miracle .
hold for a minute .
i'll be right back .
hold for a second .
something's going on .
yeah .
just hold on for a minute .
i say again , annexe team , give us a sit rep .
annexe team , come in .
do you copy?
it's got a scrambler on it .
can you do anything with it?
no .
this scramble mode must activate on this code panel .
even if we scan their frequency , we can't listen in .
these guys are pros .
so are you .
break the code .
i want to hear what these bastards are saying .
this is a ten digit control panel .
six digit read out .
hell , there could be a million combinations .
next time you kill one of these guys , get him to enter the code first .
yeah .
sir , we just monitored a call from their chief engineer .
we took out their swat team , completely .
you were right .
they went for the antenna array .
we're on schedule .
losing our team wasn't part of the plan .
attention , dulles tower .
attention , dulles control tower .
mr trudeau , i know you're listening .
unfortunately , you're not obeying .
try me face to face .
you were warned not to restore your systems .
you've wasted lives and precious time on a futile and obvious target .
now you're going to pay the penalty .
i've got five dead officers , colonel stuart .
isn't that penalty enough?
mcclane , keep out of this .
you've been a pain ...
oh , mcclane .
john mcclane .
the policeman hero who saved the nakatomi hostages .
i read about you in people magazine .
you seemed out of your league on night line .
hey , colonel , blow me .
how much drug money is esperanza paying you to turn traitor?
treason is merely a matter of dates " .
this country's got to learn it can't keep cutting the legs off ... .. of men like general esperanza .
men who have the guts to stand up against communist aggression .
and lesson one starts with killing policemen?
what's lesson two , the neutron bomb?
no .
i think we can find something in between .
watch this .
give me a flight number .
one that's low on fuel .
windsor 114 .
transatlantic from london .
fuel tank's dry as a martini .
activate the ils landing system , but re calibrate sea level ... .. minus 200 feet .
oh , jesus !
they've reset ground level , minus 200 feet .
windsor flight 114 .
this is dulles approach .
do you copy?
dulles approach , this is windsor 114 .
where the devil have you been?
windsor 114 .
we've been right here all along , old buddy .
our systems have only just came back on line .
windsor 114 , you are cleared for ils approach , ... .. runway two niner .
contact dulles tower frequency at the outer marker .
jesus christ , he's gonna crash the plane !
roger , approach , and about time .
i've got 230 people up here flying on petrol fumes .
roger , 114 .
understand .
calibrate dulles altimeter ...
oh , jesus .
they'll fly right into the concrete .
son of a bitch !
why are they listening to him?
it's our frequency !
dulles , this is windsor 114 .
barnes !
this is dulles tower .
we have radar contact ...
give me your coat !
windsor 114 , stand by ...
what are you going to do?
whatever i can .
ladies and gentlemen , we've started our descent .
we're sorry for the inconvenience , ... .. but we'll all be on the ground shortly .
thank you .
please keep your seat belts on .
we've made arrangements for your next flight , ... .. so you won't miss it , ok?
in your seat , please .
come on , in your seat .
oh , hey .
we're just like british rail , love .
we may be late , but we get you there .
don't worry .
good luck , mcclane !
dulles , this is windsor 114 inside the outer marker .
roger , 114 .
this is dulles tower .
we have radar contact and show you on ils .
you're in the glide path and looking good .
there's somebody out there !
it's mcclane .
christ .
approach flaps .
approach flaps .
approach speed 140 .

fire and rescue .
roll everything onto runway two niner !
ref speed plus 20 .

30 knot cross winds , and the runway is icy .
attaboy .
we've got you .
we've got you .
pull it up !
jesus !
aagh !
we're going to die !
we've got you .
god .
motherfucker .
motherfucker .
oh , jesus .
that concludes our object lesson for this evening .
if the 747 we requested is ready on time ... .. and general esperanza's plane arrives unmolested , ... .. further lessons can be avoided .
out .
we got no sign of survivors down here .
it's a goddamn nightmare .
hey , nelson !
come here .
barnes !
we've got to warn those planes there's a lunatic pretending he's the tower .
get me on the air .
how?
you figure it out !
here's the manifest .
mcclane , i know how you must feel .
i wanted to help those people .
i was pretty goddamn useless .
we called the government for help .
they're going to send in a special army unit .
a counter terrorist team .
your wife's plane ...
they're still broadcasting , even though we can't answer .
they're going to run out of fuel in 90 minutes .
listen , dick .
that is your name
dick .
if you're going to continue to get this close , ... .. could you switch after shaves?
anything else?
stronger mouthwash might be nice .
and here's sam coleman reporting live from the accident .
colonel , they've done everything we've anticipated ... .. so far .
but still there has been no official word .
despite the fact that only one runway has been closed due to the tragedy , ... .. several dozen airliners are visible , endlessly circling the field .
other reports say there was trouble in the tower before the crash ... .. and that that may have contributed to it .
with weather conditions worsening , ... .. the problem here and in the sky will grow .
i'm samantha coleman at dulles international airport .
victor .
victor .
victor .
yeah , what's up?
did you pack the radio mikes from the shoot or are they here?
i wouldn't let those assholes check them in !
i love you .
give me one of the receivers .
can you tune into the cockpit frequency?
yeah .
why?
i want to hear what's going on .
should be right here on our band .
nothing .
you said it would work .
is it working or not?
it is working , but all i'm getting is some kind of airport beacon .
it's weird .
it's like the tower isn't there .
stay on it .
let me know when there is something there .
ok .
major grant .
we're blue light .
rollins , department of justice .
trudeau , chief of air operations .
lorenzo , terminal police .
you want something , you got it .
this is it?
one fucking platoon?
one crisis , one platoon .
who are you?
john mcclane .
mcclane , you showed some balls out there , man .
yeah .
now show some good sense .
let the pros handle this .
i think the pros are on the wrong team tonight .
isn't colonel stuart one of your men?
no , not anymore , he's not .
we're here to take colonel stuart down .
and we will take him down .
i served with him .
i taught him everything he knows .
well , maybe he's learned a few more things since then .
let's hustle !
the command post will be set up in the airport police station .
i want to be tied into the tower in 15 minutes .
all right , let's do it !
hey , trudeau .
did things just get better or worse?
lights .
big , portable lights .
we set up the field , and then we ...
wait for those lunatics to shoot them out?
where do we get those lights?
what about the air phone idea?
there's 18 planes up there .
only five of them have those phones .
we got through to three .
we're trying the others .
that's 13 potential accidents .
are they still bucking head winds?
head winds are slamming everybody over the outer marker .
the planes with enough fuel ... .. have been shunted to atlanta , memphis and nashville .
outer marker .
damn !
the outer marker !
it's a beacon , right?
it sends out this beep beep beep ... .. so they know they're over it .
so?
who says that signal has to beep?
we switch the frequency from the tower to the one in the beacon .
we pump up the wattage .
we can talk to our planes , and those bastards who did this won't know !
traced the signal .
found it in the luggage area .
they've been tapped into your tower chatter all night .
punks stealing luggage , huh , carmine?
how you doing , telford?
no good .
i called lang .
they'll have a portable decoder here in two hours .
my wife doesn't have two hours .
i was put on grant's team yesterday .
the regular guy got appendicitis .
word is , nobody's better at this than major grant .
attention !
except maybe colonel stuart .
i want to hear about the plane those bastards asked for .
then i'll fill you in on my orders .
pilots 'briefing room .
now !
keep working .
albertson .
with me .
no civilians .
what the fuck ...?
what is it?
the outer marker beeper .
it isn't beeping .
it's talking .
attention , all aircraft in dulles landing pattern .
this is chief engineer , leslie barnes .
i have been authorized to brief you in full .
at this time , this is the only channel available to us .
here is the situation .
approximately two hours ago ...
get a load of this .
do not accept instructions claiming to be from our tower ... .. unless you hear your flight recorder access code .
the terrorists have got all ...
holy shit ! .. our systems and ...
get this on tape ! .. have control of everything except this channel .
give us a second here , please .
this channel is secure .
your own transmissions are not .
do not attempt to reply on your own frequencies to this broadcast .
these people have already caused one crash ...
.. by impersonating our tower .
jesus .
repeat .
the terrorists have cut off ... .. the two systems that allow you to land : field lights for a visual landing and the ils for an instrument .
a special us army unit is here , preparing to take out the terrorists .
my god .
don't accept any instructions ...
yo , marvin .
hey , you interested in a nice coat?
no .
it never looked good on me anyway .
you've got to get me to the pilots 'briefing room .
i've got to hear what they're saying .
which map gets me in there?
don't touch it !
don't touch it !
find the map , marvin .
i'll find it .
you'll mess up my whole damn filing system .
pilots 'briefing room , i think that's in the main terminal .
so would that be under p for pilots 'briefing room?
now , marvin !
or maybe under m for miscellaneous .
oh , shit !
request permission to reduce sentry duty to 30 minute rotation .
my men are getting cold and antsy .
over .
this is colonel stuart .
assemble the men not on watch for a briefing .
roger .
what's the matter?
oh !
gentlemen , ... .. tonight the pattern ends .
the dominoes will fall no more , ... .. and the ramparts will remain upright .
sir , general esperanza's plane is on the scope .
attention , dulles tower .
we will be lighting up a runway .
do not , repeat , do not attempt to land any planes .
remember , we're monitoring you .
what do we do?
obey .
dulles tower to foxtrot michael one .
dulles tower ... .. to foxtrot michael one .
this is foxtrot michael one , dulles .
we read you .
over .
foxtrot michael one , you are to come in on runway ... .. 1 5 , repeat , 1 5 .
i found it on the floor , by the coat , next to the luggage belt .
what the hell you so excited for?
the code's still punched into this one .
you like it , huh?
how about giving me 20 bucks for it?
how about i let you live?
the man knows how to bargain .
this is contrary to our instructions .
we are to land at runway 1 0 , ... .. where we are to be met by representatives of your justice ...
captain , please tell the tower you will proceed as ordered .
roger , dulles .
proceeding to runway 1 5 .
foxtrot michael one .
come in , please .
what are you going to do now?
are you going to shoot me?
so who will fly the plane?
don't worry about it .
it's not your problem .
michael one .
do you copy?
foxtrot michael one .
come in , please .
eagle nest .
this is falcon .
mayday .
eagle nest .
this is falcon .
mayday !
go ahead , falcon .
i've lost cabin pressure .
near zero visibility .
i must drop out of this weather and land now , ... .. on the first accessible runway .
repeat .
i've lost cabin pressure .
near zero visibility .
i must drop out of the storm .
i can land , but i must land now , on the first outgoing runway .
repeat .
i cannot circle around to runway 1 5 .
i'll make you a deal , marvin .
show me a shortcut to those runways , ... .. and i'll get you a liner for that coat .
repeat .
i cannot circle around to runway 1 5 .
stand by , falcon .
here , sir .
he's coming in from the ocean .
a bullet has damaged my instruments .
i'm not sure of my bearings , ... .. and i must make a visual landing immediately .
do you copy , eagle nest?
roger , falcon .
that would be 2 5 right .
repeat .
2 5 right .
make up your fucking mind !
we are just up to our ass in terrorists again , john .
affirmative .
2 5 right .
over .
2 5 right .
i've got to quit smoking cigarettes .
thank you for telling me , eagle nest .
but if you could show it to me as well , ... .. i would be grateful .
i see the lights .
they are directly in front of me .
gracias , compadre .
reducing air speed .
approaching runway .
wish me luck .
roger , falcon .
we copy .
we'll have you in five minutes .
that's right , asshole .
we'll have you in five minutes .
i see your lights .
eta 90 seconds .
come to papa , scumbag .
oh , shit !
no !
freedom .
not yet .
you should stay in your seat until the plane reaches the terminal .
no frequent flier mileage for you .
who are you?
a cop .
a cop?
yeah , one of the good guys .
you're one of the bad guys .
now i've got your sorry ass , i'm going to trade it for my wife .
sit down !
go in !
where did he go?
in there .
i don't believe this .
two months of planning , ... .. and you can't anticipate one pendejo of a cop .
come on , general .
where is colonel stuart?
general !
i'm all right .
he said he was a policeman .
i thought you had this place secured .
he went in the cockpit .
he's going to hell !
mcclane !
i assume it's you , mcclane .
you're quite a little soldier .
you can consider this a military funeral !
aaagh !
how many grenades we got?
three each !
use them !
oh , fuck .
go !
aaagh !
oh , shit !
you lucky fuck .
fire trucks , sir .
fall back to the church .
now !
where's the fucking door?
they're getting a little nervous back there .
in fact , so am i.
we're over washington .
see if you can get any tv to settle them down .
works for me .
i'll ...
writing your acceptance speech for the video sleaze awards?
try pulitzer .
ladies and gentlemen , ... .. while waiting to land , we are turning on local washington tv .
the sound is on channel three .
ok .
ok , ok .
please , sir , we may land at any moment .
if you'll take your seat ...
i'm going to be sick .
i'm going to be sick .
sir , the seat belt light is on .
moron .
wzdc .
this is richard thornberg .
put me through to ruben in the newsroom .
he's about to go live .
i know he is .
that's why i need him .
you'll have to hold on ...
put me through , celia , or start typing your resume .
esperanza's down , ... .. but he's hurt .
he took a round in his shoulder .
i got one more of their guys .
that's six they lost altogether .
if we knew how many they had to start with , we could get excited , ... .. but if they got 50 guys , it's a little early to open the champagne !
we appreciate your effort , but we don't need a loose cannon here !
what if they crash another plane in retaliation for your stunt?
they can't do that now , right , barnes?
besides , if i grabbed esperanza , this would be over now .
maybe they're more creative than you think !
well , at least i'm thinking , goddamn it !
we're here to jerk off that cock sucker until he tries to take off .
period !
you're the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time !
the story of my life .
major !
pentagon situation room , sir !
pentagon .
i'll take it in here .
thank you , telford .
you men come with me .
mcclane .
yeah , barnes .
you said those guys showed up right away?
yeah .
that means they're on the field or close .
and i think i know where .
let me show you something .
these are the old plans with the longer runways .
that's 12 years ago .
looks like they've modified the site , ... .. moved tra con phones , ils , all the underground stuff ... .. so they could handle drainage .
if i'm right , ... .. it would run along the airport property ... .. and go right past this neighborhood .
we should have landed two hours ago !
i understand , but if you just relax ...
it's hopeless .
somebody ought to get their ass kicked for this mess .
unfortunately , there isn't anyone we can blame for the weather .
oh , yeah?
what about that porker , willard scott?
i should have taken the bus .
at least they can pull over for food and gas .
excuse me .
yes?
i was just wondering .
this flight originally was supposed to be 5 half hours , right?
mm hmm .
do we have enough fuel to keep circling like this?
oh , of course .
they anticipate little problems like this .
we looked at 12 fucking houses , and we're nowhere .
this is our last possibility .
over here there's an old church .
let's go .
wait .
there's the church over there .
could be a sentry .
he could just be out for a walk .
then why is he going over his own footsteps?
come on .
all right .
stay here and get ready to call the marines .
i thought they were the army .
who gives a fuck?
just be ready .
oh , shit .
lorenzo , it's barnes .
where the hell did you go?
where's mcclane?
with me , at the hidey lake church , to the west of the airport .
where?
goddamn it !
you crazy idiot , why didn't ...
this must be their operations base .
shut up and get your ass here !
code red !
sitrep .
we got positive id on stuart's location .
let's move .
yo !
our escape plane will be ready within 30 minutes , general .
if there are no more surprises .
gentlemen , we have a situation here .
aagh !
ugh !
over here .
jeez , mcclane , you all right?
you want a medic?
what the hell you think you're doing , playing john wayne?
how would you like to spend the night in a cell?
lorenzo , shut the fuck up and do something useful .
go seal off the street .
hey , you can't talk to me like that .
oh , no , carmine?
sergeant , get this bureaucrat out of mr mcclane's face now .
with pleasure , sir .
major , the men are in position , sir .
close up the back .
then we go in .
fire only on my order .
roger that , sir .
guess i was wrong about you .
you're not such an asshole after all .
no , you were right .
i'm just your kind of asshole .
garber , sit rep !
army special forces on three sides , closing in fast around the back !
another problem , colonel?
no problem , general .
gentlemen , you know what to do .
down !
get down !
get down !
general , ... .. it's time .
come on , let's move it !
they're pulling out ... at the back !
what?
move it !
albertson , take your men around the back .
aagh !
aagh !
this equipment could land our planes .
there are trip wires .
they could have booby trapped ...
they did .
got one here , too .
looks like c 4 .
the motherfucker is armed .
clear the area !
everybody , now !
they booby trapped all the equipment .
seal off the building !
shit !
post sentries .
no civilians allowed .
hey , where the fuck is mcclane?
miller , take him !
i'll cover you !
aagh !
so much for the element of chance .
let's move out .
i had the bastard in my sights .
i know i did .
oh , jesus christ .
attention .
attention , dulles tower .
this is colonel stuart .
is our plane prepared?
it is .
it's in hangar 11 .
it's the most remote building we've got .
we're on our way .
have a ground crew there to confirm the condition of the plane .
do you believe the balls on this son of a bitch?
colonel , you're quite capable of confirming it yourself .
don't ask us to gift wrap potential hostages for you .
major grant , isn't it?
if you remember me , colonel , ... .. then you remember i know the drill as well as you do .
check out your own fucking plane .
we move out in five minutes .
flak jackets for everybody .
body armor for the assault team .
night scopes for the snipers .
we will take them in the hangar , and i will pull that detonator ... .. out of stuart's dead fucking hand myself .
lorenzo , take all your men back to the airport .
seal off every exit , ... .. in case they try to slip past us to break out onto the ground .
you got it .
all right , here we go .
this is nuts !
every station has people at the airport , ... .. and no one has heard a whisper of this shit !
none of them is me .
you want proof , try this .
repeat .
terrorists have murdered civilians ... .. and cut off the two systems that can allow you to land .
a special us army unit is here , preparing to take out the terrorists .
jesus christ .
i want you to go live now .
get me in from the files .
a publicity shot .
the maps , steal one from weather .
we're on it .
we're cutting in five minutes !
tell the affiliates if they want in , they got three minutes to shout .
let's do this .
network , here i come .
telford , what was your chicken shit outfit doing ... .. while we were taking grenada?
grenada .
five minutes of fire fight , five weeks of surfing .
i wish i was with you guys for that .
yeah .
me , too , kid .
really , sir?
sure .
then we wouldn't have to do this .
eagle nest , this is hatchling .
on schedule ... and in position .
roger , hatchling .
we are secure here .
you have a green light .
i repeat , a green light .
ugh !
jesus , officer , where did you come from , ... .. pearl harbor?
all right , let's clear it out , please .
stand by .
five , four , three ... this is a special bulletin from wzdc news .
there has been a plane crash at dulles , where other aircraft still circle , ... .. with no explanation from airport or faa officials .
and now , with an exclusive wzdc report , ... .. here's dick thornberg reporting from the skies over washington .
i'm one of the thousand people who has been circling our capital ... .. under the assumption that whatever problem there was below was a normal one .
but the truth is far from normal .
the truth is terrifying .
look out !
lady , look out !
look out !
look out !
look out !
look out !
get out of the way !
get out of the way !
get out of the way , lady !
go , go !
hey , hey , look out !
this is a recording of a conversation ... .. between dulles tower and a captive aircraft overhead .
get out of the way !
lorenzo !
are you out of your fucking mind?
where's the blue light team?
stuart's rigged explosives to a remote .
where's grant?
they're going to kill that son of a bitch and get it from them !
no , they're going to take off on that plane with him !
get the fuck out of here !
when the army canned stuart , he loaded that unit with his men !
are you nuts?
that fire fight ...
sideshow to buy him some time .
mcclane , you are completely around the fucking bend .
you're under arrest , motherfucker .
these are the bullets they used out there tonight !
blanks !
jesus christ .
this is chief lorenzo .
i want every officer recalled and in body armor and full weaponry ... .. in the motor pool in five minutes .
it's time to kick ass .
just like iwo jima !
we have learned that the terrorists have control of the airport , ... .. a fact that the authorities have repressed .
the terrorists promise more bloodshed unless their demands are met .
now that the special army commandos have arrived at the airport , ... .. the likelihood of a full scale battle is dangerously close .
that stupid , arrogant son of a bitch .
it's all over the airport .
300 people have died ...
when are we going to land? .. and unfortunately , they may not be the last .
the horrifying fact is that no one is safe , ... .. either in the planes above dulles or in the terminal below .
the threat of a new and higher body count at the airport ... .. hangs over the heads of everyone , ... .. and the holiday season of peace and love has become a nightmare .
all right , listen up !
all units , i want you to converge on hangar 11 , ... .. all sides !
this car , mcclane !
get in !
when the city blue show up with their backup , ... .. they'll pick up the pieces !
now , move out !
mcclane , say hi to my brother vito .
merry christmas .
hi .
goddamn it to hell !
move that piece of shit !
will you move that goddamn piece of shit ... .. out of here?
vito , get the fuck out of the car !
get your ass in gear and help me !
will you get ...?
move that car right now !
right there .
get that .
hey , coleman !
sam !
sam coleman !
hey , coleman !
hi !
coleman !
.. but at least the truth is not among the hostages ... .. because i , richard thornberg , just happened to be here ... .. to put his life and talent on the line for humanity and country .
if this should be my final broadcast ...
amen to that , ...
dick .
dick?
we're live , dick .
where are you now?
dick?
truck lights approaching , sir .
they're here , right on schedule .
the hangar door , open it .
clockwork .
jeez , you give me this story , and i'll have your baby .
not the kind of ride i'm looking for .
colonel , if i may say so , you are some piece of work .
thank you , major .
you're not so bad yourself .
congratulations on your escape , sir .
thank you , major .
save them until we are all safe , hmm?
sir .
my congratulations , gentlemen .
you've won a victory for our way of life , ... .. my pride , my admiration , and a kick ass vacation .
now , get on board .
what's the matter , cowboy?
ride too rough?
i don't like to fly .
then why are you here?
i don't like to lose , either .
ok , whoa !
here we go !
i don't know about you guys , ... .. but i've seen enough fucking snow to last me a lifetime .
you don't get much of that in the tropics .
for you gentlemen , we'll import it .
shit !
they left the hangar !
right there .
right there .
get that .
now what?
get in front !
take it down !
block their path so they can't get out !
i'm not playing chicken with a 200 ton plane !
i'm crazy , but i ain't that crazy .
forget it .
dulles , this is northeast 140 .
request clearance to land .
that's holly's plane .
repeat .
request emergency clearance .
i know you won't answer , but you better listen !
we're down to fumes , and we have to land .
in five minutes , we're coming in .
that's my wife's plane !
take it fucking down !
i'm not getting in front of that plane !
all right , how about getting over top of it?
this is the captain .
your attention .
we have no choice but to attempt an emergency landing .
fasten your seat belts and assume crash positions ... .. as instructed by your cabin attendants .
let's have the emergency check list .
attention , all air traffic in dulles area .
this is northeast 140 .
we are attempting an emergency landing .
be advised .
i don't want to die .
i don't want to die .
i don't want to die .
just buckle your seat belt .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
lean forward .
god !
oh , god .
oh , god , ...
thy rod and thy staff they comfort me .
just hang on !

# oh , the weather outside is frightful

# but the fire is so delightful
# and since we've no place to go
# let it snow , let it snow , let it snow
# it doesn't show signs of stopping
# and i brought some corn for popping
# the lights are turned way down low
# let it snow , let it snow , let it snow
# when we finally kiss goodnight
# howl hate going out in the storm
# but if you'll really hold me tight
# all the way home i'll be warm
# the fire is slowly dying
# and , my dear , we're still goodbying
# but as long as you love me so
# let it snow , let it snow , let it snow
# when we finally kiss goodnight
# howl hate going out in the storm
# but if you'll really hold me tight
# all the way home i'll be warm
# the fire is slowly dying
# and , my dear , we're still goodbying
# but as long as you love me so
# let it snow , let it snow , let it snow
# it doesn't show signs of stopping
