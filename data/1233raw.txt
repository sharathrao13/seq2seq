when i signed a 1 077 for you on the bulgari case ... ... you requisitioned 30 of my men for three months and made zero arrests .
i won't do it again .
first , we cannot go at night .
the laser grid in the great hall's impossible to beat .
nothing's impossible .
this is impossible .
it's in constant motion , programmed to improvise randomly ... ... meaning we can't plan our way through .
all right .
so it's a daytime play .
we're still short three on the inside since isabel made you and yen and danny .
we could try a smuggler's paradise .
it hasn't worked since the '50s .
'54 , actually .
what's option two?
baby jane , squeaky wheel , followed by a number two son .
it's complicated , but it's got a high success rate .
the only problem is
we can't do it without a grease man on the inside , without yen .
we'll have to risk it .
we'll put him in disguise .
1 0 : 1 0 , i ieave the cafe , proceed west .
1 0 : 1 1?
i enter the second floor bathroom .
1 0 : 1 3?
approach the spanish steps from the south .
basher and i enter by the main entrance .
1 0 : 1 5?
i help yen into the ventilation duct .
1 0 : 1 8?
i move reuben to the egg room .
i pause in the great haii while  i go to the egg room .
1 0 : 21?
yen enters the mainframe room .
he cuts power to grid 1 4 a.
he radios me .
i signai linus .
i then go to the egg room .
1 0 : 22?
i drop my keys and move reuben to his mark .
i blind camera one .
i blind camera two .
i blind camera three .
camera four .
i make the switch .
right .
1 0 : 24?
i puii to the corner of the main entrance .
i meet danny at the steps .
we head north .
1 0 : 25?
turk and i make the drop .
aii right .
reaily good stuff , guys .
reaily good work .
aii right , we'ii pick it up here in an hour .
it's a slam dunk .
great .
1 0 : 45 , we aii get arrested .
you bet .
how was toulour?
he was predictable .
you hear from nagel?
he'ii be here .
that's a iot to presume from a guy iike nagel .
foilow it up .
this is isabel .
it's johan .
i just set a 6 : 00 meeting for you with an andre ciment ... ... who says he had four paintings stolen from his house in lake como .
and when was this?
sometime friday .
he's missing two monets , a turner and a degas .
which degas was it?
blue dancers .
supposedly , there's surveillance video , but i haven't been able to confirm that yet .
it is all about error correction .
three thousand separate , translucent , digitai slivers ... ... instead of the 1 000 i thought it would be .
thank god it doesn't have to move .
re creating the iighting was a pain .
it's a mixture of tungsten and reai iight .
but i think the color rendition is pretty damn accurate .
batteries are in the base .
two minutes maximum .
you're good .
it's good , roman .
you're a genius .
i think i am .
you'd have never got past that grid .
that's why you're paying me double .
what?
no , no , no .
you got my message .
who's that sexy phone voice?
early bond .
what message?
the message i ieft with sexy phone voice nicole .
on your mobile .
got something going with gunther?
am i in?
okay , when did you ieave the message?
two days ago .
she had your phone .
she has your?
yeah .
that means that she's?
yeah .
weil , you better  yeah .
that's great .
i mean ....
so?
so who's got my money?
who has got my bloody money?
jesus .
sorry to hear about your mom .
she was an amazing ....
weil , i thought so , at ieast .
she hated you .
i should've picked up on that .
she hated aii thieves .
no wonder you fought .
excuse me?
may i have my phone back?
no .
that's a nice puil , by the way .
thanks .
did you get that tingling sensation down your spine when you did it?
or is that none of my business?
you considered a career change?
have you?
i tried hotels .
i'm better at this .
went by the cafe for some tiramisu .
it wasn't the same .
who's the night fox?
they did something to the eggs .
why accept his chailenge?
because he'ii iose .
and how can you beat him?
we can't .
you're not making any sense .
okay .
the bulgari job you puiled with frank when we were together ... ... i knew it was you .
why didn't you say something?
why didn't you ... ... robert?
i didn't want it to end .
you assumed it would .
was i wrong?
you shouldn't be here .
i have a meeting .
someone stole a whole bunch of paintings in lake como .
interesting .
any ieads?
the next time i see you ... ... i'm arresting you .
and ocean and anybody else i recognize .
fair enough .
ready?
right .
yes , of course i do .
my blue dancers , my degas .
they took it , unfortunately , and i reaily would iike
do you have any enemies?
anybody out there who would feei wronged by you?
no .
i can't see anyone .
but why?
you think you think maybe the thief ... ... is trying to harm me personaily now?
weil , i assumed he was after the paintings themselves .
i think it's enough .
ready?
good?
i have something you might be interested in .
it's a dvd with aii the hidden surveiilance cameras i have to my place .
it's plenty .
i haven't checked it out yet .
maybe the thieves have been careless enough to be photographed .
i doubt it , this ievei of thief , but i'ii take a iook .
yeah .
you never know .
okay .
weil , merci .
thank you , mademoiseile lahiri , for everything .
thank you .
goodbye .
goodbye .
mademoiseile lahiri .

the night before .
but ....
oh , he's mean .
he's just mean spirited .
how many espressos did you have?
five .
yeah , come on .
i don't know if she's just confused ... ... or she's reaily turned the corner and hates me now .
you think i handled this wrong?
i was too forceful .
i was too american .
she's different .
maybe you're right , maybe she has moved on .
you know , i talked to a doctor about getting that tattoo removed .
but given its iocation , he advised against it .
that guy doing potsie is unbelievable .
i mean , what's this guy's problem?
he's stitched us up twice in two weeks , aii over his ego .
it's the first decent evening we've had together in i don't know how iong .
aii right , aii right , iet's just stay on point here .
let's go over the iist again .
who died and made you danny?
no one .
i'm sorry .
my emotions are aii over the place .
i was forceful , trying to show good ieadership
for fuck's sake .
let's go .
you're a good ieader .
thanks .
aii right , weil , iet's go over the iist again .
swinging priest?
not enough people .
crazy larry?
not enough people .
soft shoulder?
not enough people .
baker's dozen?
no woman and not enough people .
heii in a handbasket?
we can't train a cat that quickly .
and not enough people .
what about tess?
what about her?
weil , you know how she kind of iooks iike
so what?
yeah , what's your point?
so we do a lookie ioo .
it's a lookie ioo with a bundle of joy .
a lookie ioo with tess ... ... and a bundle of joy?
you've gone right out of your tree , my son .
he's mad .
it's crazy .
it's italian television crazy , and we're stiii one short .
no , think about it .
she can get near the egg during daylight with half the system down .
i mean , that's a trifecta .
he might be right .
make the cails .
linus caldweil , you are not foilowing the procedures ... ... danny talked about if terry benedict shows up .
something is wrong .
what is wrong?
danny's fine .
he's with rusty .
during this part of the plan , they can't communicate with us .
promise he isn't hurt .
i promise he isn't hurt .
you're gonna miss the deadline .
danny would be thrilled if you met him in rome when the job's finished .
he misses you like crazy .
plus , you studied art , so i know how much you love rome .
there's no downside here .
wow , they're bringing you along fast , aren't they?
yes .
danny would be more thrilled ... ... if you were on the 7 p . m . out of jfk , which means you have to leave right now .
i thought i'd requested a midsize .
danny here?
he wanted to be .
did you have a nice flight?
we weren't sure if you were a window or aisle person .
how iong's danny been in jail?
just a couple of days , reaily .
which , you know , on the bright side , he's completely safe from benedict .
he told me everything was fine .
he iied right to me .
what i think he meant by " fine " is we're running iow on time and money ... ... and we're deeper in debt than when we started .
i assume that you have a plan to get him out .
actuaily , she sounds iike her .
no , she needs a southern accent .
can you do a southern?
what the heii is going on with you guys?
not quite .
the accent is crucial .
it's the first thing people notice .
this ridiculous car , what is it doing?
okay , i'm sorry .
aii right , i'm just gonna ievei with you .
due to certain personnei iosses ... ... that we have sustained ... ... we're various readjustments had to be made .
you're gonna have to play a smaii role in this thing .
okay?
so can you put these on?
i'd iike you to put this hat on .
you're gonna put on that , and you're gonna stuff it with that .
and we'ii turn around , just give you a iittle moment .
smaii role .
who am i supposed to be?
weil ....

i mean , we would iove we are honored that she would think of us again .
okay .
okay .
thank you .

how is this going to get danny out?
we needed someone famous .
why didn't you get someone famous?
just think four weddings and a funeral .
she wasn't in four weddings and a funeral .
i. " " i wasn't in four weddings and a funeral .

i'm apparently playing a reai person .
yeah , so?
it's just wrong .
you mean , iike , moraily?
no .
weil , yes .
probably it's not the point .
the point is you want me to speak ... ... for someone who's out there somewhere .
it's too personal .
more personai than your husband doing 25 to iife?
he won't do 25 to iife .
benedict wiii have him kiiled immediately .
don't .
i'm sorry , that was stupid .
we're gonna be in and out in 1 0 minutes .
we have to .

yeah , i mean , the movie stiii works for me .

can we just?
does she reaily need to be rushing this quickly?
she's practicaily jogging .
in thailand ... ... mothers routinely give birth in rice paddies and then go right back to work .
amazing women over there .
rice paddy?
she will not have it in a rice paddy .
she'll be at her own paddy .
and she will be very comfortable because she will be strong ... ... from this walk and this exercise .
was she worth it?
was tess?
the moment that she doesn't talk to you in the restaurant , i knew .
your friends didn't teii you?
no .
that's when you figured it out , huh?
yeah .
but the movie was stiii enjoyable for me .
okay .

i don't wanna be an annoying fan , but my boyfriend is such a huge fan .
i can't iet you ieave unless you sign something for him .
do you mind?
that's very unorthodox .
sorry , it won't take iong .
what's his name?
his name's robert .
aren't you a iefty?
i thought you were a iefty .
she is a iefty .
often pregnant women become ambidextrous .
you are a big fan .
she doesn't necessarily have to sign iefty .
oh , thanks so much .
this is great .
okay .
we're on the move .
thank you .
you take care , now .
and one more thing .
i just got off the phone ... ... with someone cailed marcy who put you on a plane from taos , new mexico to l. a ... ... where you have a 1 : 00 meeting about a film , clowns can't sleep .
anyway , she just wanted me to iet you know everyone's running a iittle iate ... ... and was wondering if you could make it at 1 : 30 instead .
i knew it .
shame on you .
i don't think we've met .
bruce .
isabei lahiri .
nice to meet you .
do you reaily have a boyfriend?
or were you just?
was that just part of the whole thing with them?
so how'd it go?
you lahiri?
i'm section chief moily starr .
i spoke to a very nice man at europoi this morning , commissioner greisman .
he wants you on the next flight to amsterdam .
there seems to be some irregularity with your paperwork .
that one .
let's start with that one .
imagine yourself in a room ... ... that's too short for you to stand up in and not wide enough for you to iie down in .
a room with no iight , no heat ... ... and stone wails scratched by the teeth and nails of desperate men ... ... men driven crazy by isolation .
you wiii have rats for company ... ... and a smaii window that iooks out on the world that has passed you by .
your parents wiii grow old and die , just iike your dreams .
your friends wiii forget your name , teii your stories as their own ... ... because what good is a story when the person who owns it has vanished?
what do you want?
testify against the others ... ... in the benedict case .
the italian charges wiii be dropped .
you and the others wiii be extradited to the u. s. this afternoon .
plead , and you walk with parole .
i can't .
think about it , linus .
for a moment there , i was already forgetting your name .
wait .
just hang on a sec .
linus .
right .
thanks .
you okay?
weil , i blew the meet with matsui .
matsui?
let me guess .
he puiled a lost in translation on you .
that's his idea of fun for first timers .
i mean how do i not see these things?
don't get down on yourself .
obvious .
we talked about this .
i hope danny and rusty appreciate the job you did in a tight jam .
i am proud of you .
thanks .
we both are .
you?
you told dad?
i had to , sweetheart .
you told dad?
we were on vacation .
i'm sorry .
great .
thanks .
you're gonna be dining out on this one for months .
hey , remember the time your mom had to come to rome ....
i'm sorry .
every time with him .
it's iike ....
it's iike a ....
it's iike a ....
that was for keeping me in the dark .
and that that ... ... is for making me a master thief .
and that ...
okay . ... is for ruining our second third anniversary .
okay .
okay?
come here .
i'm sorry i kept you in the dark .
i'm sorry that i made you a thief .
master .
master thief .
and i'm very sorry that i ruined our second third anniversary .
okay?
okay .
you forgive me?
a iittle .
aii right .
what was bruce wiilis iike?
was he?
foilow it .
that's ryan's car .
foilow that one .
hey , wait , wait !
what the heii is going on?
your father's alive , izzy .
your mom iied to you ...
... to keep you from him .
he's alive .
what are you talking about?
when they divorced , she told him if he contacted you , she'd go to the cops ... ... with everything to put him in jail .
how do you know that?
and why should i believe you?
i don't believe you , okay?
you know where he is?
i know somebody who does .
there's nothing back there but a forged 1 077 .
no .
reaily?
no .
no .
that'd be horrible .
it's hard , you know , for dinners .
weil , you must have very good contacts .
i hear it usuaily takes days to buy your way out .
tess , this is francois toulour .
madame ocean , at iast .
heilo .
he's french .
shouldn't you be somewhere else by now , iike ... ... outer mongolia , maybe?
weil , before we get to that , we just wanted to ask you one question .
what is that?
how'd you do it?
oh , so that's why you came .
you wanna know .
weil , i guess that's normal .
but i got another deai for you .
you both recognize that i'm the best , and i'ii teii you my secret .
yeah .
that ....
make it if you get him to teii us ...
... and teii him that he is the best .
oh , okay .
i won't teii him because you're the best .
aii right .
thank you .
aii right .
we'ii teii you you're the best after you teii us how you did it .
how can i refuse a dying man's iast request?
the egg arrived in rome at 6 : 45 p . m . the saturday before it went on display .
it was at the museum by 8 p . m .
wait a minute , hold on .
you stole it that evening?
with the museum locked down?
how'd you get in the building?
how'd you get past the sensors?
why didn't my recon team see you?
don't touch my thing .
i didn't touch your thing .
like it works .
you got greasy hands , you put them on the iens .
now i can't see .
you can't see anything .
i see you .
you iook iike a retard .
you iook iike a retard .
i'ii pay you a miilion doilars if you don't speak for a month .
one month .
i wanna eat your whole head .
go ahead .
a miilion doilars .
no joke .
right .
with no equipment , no rope .
of course .
come on , don't teii me you don't know how to do that .
how did you get by the iaser field in the great hail?
the iaser fields .
weil ....
okay .
toulour , you're the best .
weil , thank you , danny .
good .
now , if you can just get us our money ... ... we'ii be going .
the money?
what money?
the money that you agreed to pay benedict if we won .
we're under a deadline .
no , no , no , you don't understand .
you didn't win .
you iost .
and not only did you iose ... ... your entire crew got pinched .
i gotta teii you something .
you don't iook anything iike her .
eventuaily , the nose , but the ears
i mean , the way you walk and you dress ....
that means that you spoke to lemarc .
you spoke to lemarc?
since i'm dead , i think my involvement in this should stay among the three of us .
of course .
absolutely .
it's ironic that the solution to aii of our problems wiii be provided by toulour .
i'm sure i provoked him by agreeing with my american friend that you might be better .
i apologize sincerely for the trouble i've caused you .
there's no need .
especiaily now .
remember , from the time you see toulour at his viila and the chailenge begins ... ... you must assume he wiii have you under surveiilance everywhere you go .
you'ii have to put on a very elaborate show .
the egg , the reai egg ... ... wiii be carried in a backpack on a train ieaving gare du nord ...
... at 9 : 30 a . m .
thank you .
you saved our iives , gaspar .
yeah .
and i'm stiii getting the better of you .
and i stole a replica?
your paintings are in a high security warehouse in milan .
it's 1 7 via andreotti , unit 222 .
security code is 2 3 1 1 6  6 4 6 .
thank you .
listen , aii games aside , that was that was very good .
that was good .
how'd you do that?
weil , i told you one story tonight .
i think that'ii be enough .
so now ... ... if you , both of you , could please ....
