you got the disk three minutes ago .
what took you so long?
i was having too much fun with this " mozart's ghost " .
i sent you a whopper of a virus .
be careful with the " escape " button .
here's the problem .
click on " concert information " .
houston utilities " .
i think you took a wrong turn here .
not quite " ticketmaster " , is it?
see anything unusual?
no , it looks like a normal web page , except for that icon .
click on it . then press " contrl shift " .
my god !
what do you make ofit?
it's just a glitch that sends you to the wrong internet address .
last night i got amtrak and the mayo clinic .
they have different subnets .
i accessed a system i shouldn't have .
that disk is power
then find the error and delete it .
i'm not ready to do that yet .
what's your day like tomorrow?

i'm going on my first vacation in six years .
it's reserved and confirmed .
what time's your flight?

we can't take on someone new to replace dale .
because ofoursecurity problems .
replace dale?
you're kidding , right?
i thought you'd heard .
what happened?
dale's dead .
his plane crashed outside l. a.
he was coming to see me .
it puts things in perspective .
let's talk when you get back .
and ... try to have a good vacation .

angela bennett .
angela .
hi .
my most embarrassing secret?
you know " breakfast at tiffany's "?
it's my favourite film .
i wore out my membership renting it .
you know what i'm talking about , then .
when i was about thirteen , i had this sort of ... ... identity crisis .
i thought i was in the film .
that you were audrey hepburn?
no .
i used to think i was the cat .
i'd sit there and i'd play out the last scene of the movie  over and over again .
you know the last scene?
the alleyway in the pouring rain .
i'm soaked to the bone , and i'm scared . and ...
i'm abandoned .
i'm alone .
and that's it .
would you have dinner with me tonight?
come on , it's your last night !
you know what?
i'd actually really love to .
great .
it's a company perk .
some perk !
i think i got a calendar one year from cathedral .
you're from colorado?
it has to be the eastern ... ... or maybe the southeastern part of the state .
the teeming metropolis of la junta .
population , fifty .
is my accent that strong after all these years?
no , it's just a trick i do .
after all these years?
how long?
it seems like a lifetime ...
let's see ...
i was fifteen , going on ten ,  and we moved from la junta to san jos .
tulsa ...
your father got transferred?
not really .
i don't know , he just ... transferred out , one day .
what are you looking at?
you .
me?
computers are your life , right?
yes , the perfect hiding place .
a picture of you .
yeah , okay ...
i have one or two other interests .
such as?
what's your speciality?
anything , pretty much .
beta testing , mostly .
that's way over my head .
you just go into people's systems , find the faults . and fix them .
what if there are no faults?
i don't believe i've met one , yet .
you must be a bit cold .
not really ...
yeah , a little bit .
here .
it goes round here .
want one?
i used to smoke those ...
but you quit , right?
well .
i refuse to .
i try to do without a safety net .
how else do you know you're alive?
i take my share of risks .
i don't always floss .
i rip the tags off my pillows when they're new .
my kind of woman !
feeling adventurous?
what did you have in mind?
dare you risk it?
my purse !
no , it's not worth getting killed over .
jack . come back !
it's not here .
or at the hotel .
i looked .
so i do like magician ...
yeah , you're the midget houdini !
dinero?
jack?
i had everything in that bag .
my passport , my credit cards ...
thanks for doing this .
you're bleeding to death , and i'm crying about my mastercard .
i apologise for being a jerk .
what do you mean?
i'm the jerk .
i was only trying to impress you .
for future reference , the living interest me more than the dead .
i suppose that's quite healthy .
i suppose we should call the cancun police on the radio .
it's not working .
we have to head further out .
sail to morocco . for all i care .
it's beautiful out here .
how are we doing?
still no dice .
i'm just going down below .
i won't be a minute .
maybe we're not out far enough .
no . this should do it .
tonight's been so out of control , huh?
don't take this the wrong way , but this isn't exactly my style .
i thought you liked taking risks .
yes , but you know what i mean .
you know ... first date . sex . one night stand .
that so of ting .
you're the relationship kind?
absolutely .
both times .
so when was the last time?
1933 .
i see .
who was he?
a college boyfriend?
i bet he was the captain of the drinking team .
wasn't ready for a relationship .
i wish i had been that lucky .
no , it was my shrink , actually .
you know the story .
i thought i was lonely , and ... ... he forgot he was married .
but it didn't last very long .
and then my mom developed alzheimer's . so it was ...
you know what?
i'm going to shut up right now !
it's okay .
it's me who can't bear to hear it .
sorry .
i'm rambling because i'm a iittle nervous .

you're not listening .
so somebody stole your purse ...
i didn't think you'd believe me .
i do .
no . that's not true .
i believe you're very frightened and isolated from the human race .
and then your father leaving ...
my father didn't take my car !
he didn't sell my house , get the police after me or try to kill me !
i believe something happened , but that doesn't make sense .
i don't want to be simplistic , but you're just reaching out ,
yes !
i'm reaching out to anyone who knows me . will listen to me .  and be my friend .
someone i can trust ...
i'm sorry .
it's easier for me to play doctor than to listen .
i don't understand .
why me?
i'm nobody .
they knew everything .
what i ate and drank . what movies i watched .  where i was from . what cigarettes i used to moke ...
they must watch the internet .
our whole lives are on computer .
they knew i could be " vanished '" and no one would care .
it's okay .
what can i do?
put my mom somewhere else .
put her under a different name .
you can do that . as a doctor?
sure .
i can put your mom in the county sanitarium .
how's that?
it would mean a lot .
she's all i've got left .
christ , angie !
they've really gotten into your head with this .
put yourself in my shoes .
suddenly you ring with this convoluted story .
listen , i don't buy the whole story , but i have a friend in the fbl ...
no !
i'm running from the police .
that's the last thing i need .
well then , why don't you just live the rest of your life in this hotel?
do you trust him?
i went with him to frat parties .
i'm serious .
do you trust him?
yeah .
i trust ben .
i do !
now i'll go and figure out how to transfer your mom to the sanitarium .
then i'll call ben .
if i get any information , i'll call .
don't be so down .
it'll be okay , i'm on watch now .

can i tell you about my friend , ben phillips?
i told him your story .
he wants to see you in the morning .
can't you wait?
he knows what happened in atlanta?

you're going to meet a guy named cyberbob?
have you ever even seen him?
i don't want you to go there alone .
bob fox
hi .
bob fox?
they killed dale .
now they think i have the programme .
first you say someone tried to kill you , then dale?
and they put someone in my place .
why would anyone do all this?
they would want someone at cathedral to overwrite the programmes .
and you can't do that from outside .
you know devlin's internet number?
i plugged it in , and got into michael bergstrom's medical files .
the guy who blew his head off?
a computer said he had alds .
but when they did the autopsy , there was no hlv .
if you're dead , you get the truth .
i'm starting to believe you .
i need to go to cathedral and find " mozart's ghost " .
they've got an echo system that can re trace all your keystrokes ...
are you all right?
pull over .
you're scaring me .
the pills ...
what pills?
we'll go to the hospital .
he's okay , isn't he?
he's allergic to penicillin .
he's being intubated .
i have no idea what you just said .
he'll be fine .
you can see him .
i would like that .
thank you .
hi .
how do you feel?
i'm starving .
when you get out , i'll cook you the best microwave meal you've ever had .
how long will they keep me here?
just another day .
and will you be handling the out patient care , nurse?
well , do you mind?
visions of sponge baths dance in my head .
i've got to go .
are you going to be okay?
i'll be fine .
i wish it was over , but i'll be fine .
come here .
i want to tell you somethig .
come close .
i wanted to do that since yesterday .
when you get better , i might let you do it again .
do you still think i'm crazy?
sure i do .
i always have .
want to dance?
come on , give benny a big hug !
come on back here !
it's safer to stay right here .
sorry , bob couldn't make it .
is that how to greet an old lover?
you're not one .
i'm surprised you didn't kill me , then fuck me !
it was difficult . because i was attracted to ou .
i still am .
i'm going to attract the police if you don't go away .
you've been avoiding them since you ran away .
they'd be interested to hear how you killed dale and came after me .
go ahead !
they'll be happy to make your acquaintance .
did you know that ruth marx has a criminal record for drugs  and prostitution?
you've got quite a record .
like bergstrom's?
i know about his suicide . and about the praetorians .
i'm sure they'd love to hear about that .
everybody has their button .
and bergstrom's was homophobia .
you just have to know ... which button to push .
i don't have your disk .
it was ruined in mexico .
that's okay .
but what we need now is what's up here , so come with me .
i promise you , i'll look after you .
what do you want?
it's not what i want .
it's what my employers want .
take a look around you .
are things working?
no .
they can make things better .
by killing people?
i don't ask too many questions .
hey , quit !
don't push !
jerk !
everybody , clear !
let's go !
everybody , clear !
he's got no pulse .
get her out !
no , he's my friend .

mrs. champion , i'm sorry .
we did our best .
there were complications .
would you like me to call a cab?
can someone pick you up?
ma'am ... would you like to talk with a counsellor?
maybe you should lie down ...
you said he was going to be fine .
i'm sorry .
it was the insulin ...
no .
he was on penicillin .
he was being treated for diabetes .
no . no !
he was not a diabetic !
but it says on his file ...
hello?
it's great to hear your voice .
don't hang up , angela !
this is important ifyou wouldjust  take a step back from this , you'd see we're not so different .
we're both loners . both isolated . both really trusting . ,
we're both looking for the same clarity .
you mean a great deal to me .
yeah?
you mean shit to me .
i admit an arrogance in my perceptions of you .
i've come to vis t a fri . d ofmine .
an old piano teacher friend , you leave my mother alone .
i seem to have no choice .
she's been moved by dr champion .
the late dr. champion .
llcense verlflcatlon reported stolen
shit !
driver , this is the highway patrol .
pull overand turn offyour engine .
there it is .
there she is !
police !
stop !
freeze !
my name is angela bennett ...

flngerprlnt match
mother dead from overdose
i want to help you , but what you're saying is so far fetched .
they changed your name , medical records , crashed planes ..?
just think about it .
our whole world is sitting there on a computer .
everything .
your car records , your social security ,  your credit cards , your medical history .
it's all there .
like a little electronic shadow just begging to be screwed with .
today it's me , tomorrow it's you .
look .
miss marx ...
i'm not ruth marx .
they put her on your computer .
i hate to tell you this , but all the police computers  have for the last six months been protected by " gatekeeper " .
so nothing that you're describing could possibly happen .
oh my god , it's the programme .
gatekeeper has a flaw .
if they changed my identity , the praetorians must know !
then that solves it .
where did you get the stolen car?
okay , listen to me .
it's like a trojan horse , this thing , the praetorians .
they hack into computers and cause chaos .
lax , wall street , the department of water and power in atlanta ...
they do it so that people buy this programme for security .
only to find out they've given the praetorians access to the system .
imagine what they can do with this power .
this is fascinating , miss marx .
please , my name is bennett .
write it down , if you want .
b e n n e t t.
why would i make this up?
i'm your appointed attorney .
i'm obligated to do as you wish .
i'll call you cleopatra if you want .
but if you go before the judge with this craziness .  you will be found incompetent to stand trial  and they will hold you indefinitely .
hi .
yeah , this is her daughter .
hi mom .
it's me .
are you doing okay?
how's that new nurse treating you?
it's angela , mom .
it's angela .
mom . listen .
i need you to do something for me .
there's a lady here ...
she's going to take the phone , and you tell her that i'm me .
because she doesn't believe me .
can you tell her that , mom?
mom . don't .
are yo there?
i just want you to know that i love you .
lady?
what?
who's come to get me?
special agent ben phillips , fbl .
i'm alan's friend .
terrible , what happened to him .
i'm so glad that you're here .
as soon as i heard your story i had half our agents chasing this down .
beating every bush , trying to find you .
sorry it had to be here .
me too .
let's get out of here .
there's an office 40 minutes away .
and then what?
then i'm going fishing for a shark named jack devlin .
know him?
he's a one man dirty duty squad .
efficient and lethal .
the moral conscience of a chainsaw .
but the guys behind him are worse .
the praetorians .
we've been chasing them for years .
but we have to move a. s. a. p .. so sketch me a quick backgroud .
how the hell did you access their system in the first place?
i didn't , a programmer at cathedral sent a disk to me .
a goddamn disk !
that's what started all this up .
did you make a copy of the disk before it was ruined in mexico?
no .
damn !
that disk is our only hope ofcatching these bastards .
did you give any copies away?
you are amazing sons of bitches .
how did you know it was ruined?
i only told devlin that .
you're not even fbl .
but it doesn't matter .
ever since i got that disk i've gone from one nightmare to the next .
but now i'm tired of it .
get off the gas !
you're gonna kill us .
