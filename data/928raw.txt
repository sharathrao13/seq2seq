my brother arnie's about to turn 18 .
my family's planning a big party for him .
watching the campers is our yearly ritual .
they're doing the right thing just passing through .
oh , god , arnie .
you're getting so big , soon i ain't going to be able to carry you no more .

you're getting littler .
you're shrinking .

endora .
endora is where we are .
describing endora is like dancing to no music .
it's a town where nothing much ever happens , and nothing much ever will .
lamson's grocery is where i work , and miles out of town on the interstate , there's foodland , where everyone else shops .
this is where i live with my family .
my dad built the house , and it's my job to keep up the repairs .
ooh !
doctors said we'd be lucky ... if arnie lived to be 10 .
well , 10 came and went , and now the doctors are saying any time now .
arnie could go at any time .
ah ha ha ha !
ooh !
" some days you want him to live ...
the head .
some days you don't .
what is it , buddy?
i killed him .
i killed him , gilbert .
i killed him .
i know , buddy .
i know .
my older sister amy is more like a mother .
she used to manage the elementary school cafeteria over in motley , until it burned down last year .
my other sister , ellen , just turned 15 .
she got her braces off .
for days , she's been walking around going , " ooh , ahh , " like she can't believe the feel of teeth .
i got another brother , larry , but he got away .
and then there's momma , who , in her day , was the prettiest girl in these parts .
ever since our dad was hung out to dry 17 years ago , momma's had her hands full .
you see , with momma , there's no nice way to break it to you .
she hasn't left the house in over 7 years .
" i'm gilbert .
i need your help .
" what is it?
" gilbert grape .

and , momma , you can supervise everything .
" ok with everybody?
" that's disgusting .
what about me?
you are the guest of honour .
gilbert , what about me?
my party .
it's my party .
show up , buddy .
that's your job .
all you have to do is show up .
all you have to do is turn 18 .
you know , that just leaves gilbert .
huh?
you don't have anything to do .
got any ideas?
sure , he does .
no , i don't .
yes , you do .
i'm almost 16 , and i got pages of ideas .
she designed a cake .
you haven't done anything .
" stop it , ellen .
can i be excused?
he never does anything !
please , can't we do something as a family?
can i please be excused?
" we're planning this as a family .
" it's my party , though !
it'll be an exact copy ... of the original they built in boone .
really?
" which is no big deal , " because all burger barns are built identical .
they're prefabricated .
they just ship 'em out .
it's so efficient , it's amazing .
in the matter of a couple days , there can be a whole new restaurant there .
i was driving past the building site today .
you know , it's going up ... right down the road from foodland .
the general manager was there , so i says , " can i fill out an application?
he said , " you bet you can .
so i did , and it looks really good .
i might be wearing one of them uniforms , flipping some burgers , salting some fries .
you never know .
it could be the best thing that ever happened to me .
hey !
get out of there !
i saw her !
i saw her !
that wasn't nice .
what?
what'd i do?
you know what you did .
that's your mother in there .
your mother .
i know .
i don't get you , man .
i just don't get it .
let's go , buddy .
ok .
come on .
gilbert , run now !
run !
hey , bye bye , momma .
bye bye .
bye , you guys .
move , baby .
gilbert , you're shrinking .
shrinking , shrinking , shrinking , shrinking , shrinking .
i'm not tired yet , gilbert .
you got to go to sleep , ok?
ok .
goodbye .
it's not goodbye , it's goodnight .
yeah .
goodbye is for when you're going away , and we're not going anywhere , are we?
i know that .
jeez , i know that , gilbert .
see you tomorrow .
we're not going anywhere .
goodbye .
arnie .
you got to work later?
yeah , i do .
i got to come back .
how's momma?
she's fat .
come on , man .
she's not all that big , gilbert .
what?
i saw a guy at the state fair ... who was ... a little bit bigger .
a little bit bigger?
she's not the biggest i've ever seen .
tucker , she's a whale .
take her out for a walk .
take her out for a jog .
hey , bobby .
bobby .
give her a chance .
hi , guys .
how's business?
oh , not good .
hey !
nobody's dying .
there's a ladder .
there's a clear corporate ladder .
that's good .
i mean , this is good .
that's a good thing for you to do .
if you'd give it a chance ...
i just was saying ... that it wasn't something i should be doing .
they use canola oil , ok?
you know what canola oil is?
probably don't even sell it at lamson's grocery .
it's cutting edge .
it creates a crispier french fry ... and a more unique product .
forget wendy's , forget burger king , forget mcdonald's .
that's , like , old hat .
burger barn is cutting edge .
i could really stand behind it .
it's an innovative place .
they created the salad bar , which is now mimicked by every single fast food chain in america .
they came up with that .
15 different toppings for each salad ... and two kinds of lettuce , and it's all that you care to eat .
you either go from clerk to fry cook ... to cook to assistant manager , or you go from clerk to cashier captain to assistant manager .
and then from assistant manager , you go to manager and then regional manager and then ...
" look at the little fellas .
" you mean my hoppers?
let's try this .
for my friend .
there you go , my boy .
what do you say , arnie?
uh ... thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
gilbert .

yes .
i'll do it .
don't worry , i'll do it .

i could go at any time .
" shh .
arnie , no .

excuse me .

oh , just keep going straight .
all right .
my mom wants me to become 18 .
i'm having a big ... a big party , huh , gilbert?
yep .
when's that party coming?
6 days .
6 days and i become 18 .
i'm 18 , and you're not invited .
arnie , don't be rude .
oh , it's ok .
he's just being honest .
i don't mind .
ha ha !
ha ha ha ha ha ...
i ...
i got the groceries .
all right .

i got the groceries .

it's ok .
don't worry about it .
no , i'm really ...
i'm really sorry .
it's ok .
" i'm sorry .
" don't be sorry .
are you sorry?
uh uh .
no .
i'm not sorry .
he's not sorry .
we're not sorry .
don't be sorry .
i'm not sorry .
if we're having people come that early , we should have some appetizers .
that'd be good .
you know those little vienna sausage things?
you use grapejelly and ketchup for a sauce .
" i was thinking ...
i want hot dogs , mom .
you know , like those hawaiian appetizers .
you get pineapple chunks out of the can ... and wrap them with bacon and put toothpicks through them .
how do you cook the bacon?
in the oven on a pan .
but the bacon won't be crisp ... if you bake it in the oven on a sheet .
" yes , it will .
and nobody wants greasy , floppy bacon .
momma , i want hot dogs !
we're going to have hot dogs , honey .
i promise we're going to have hot dogs .
" i want hot dogs !
every party that i've been to ...
" ellen .
ellen .
what?
could you not talk with your mouth full?
excuse me?
you're making me sick .
i'm going to throw up .
oh .
ok , dad .
ellen .

ok , dad .

amy .
2 x 10s and the 2 x 12s , and the space between 'em here ... is ... should ... they're right now at 2 feet , and this should be 16 inches .
that's just standard .
see this here , flat flooring?
flat flooring's , like , once the wood gets old , you'll just fall right through it .
yeah , i guess daddy wasn't much of a carpenter .
hey , gilbert , why did he use 2 x 6s instead of ...
tucker .
what?
shh .
keep it down .
oh , sorry .
" [ toilet flushes ]
she's coming .
hey !

their car broke down or something .
i can see it in your face ...

change the subject?
you understand?
we want a pool .
" you're telling me later .
i'll tell you everything later .
look at those guys out there .
they're laughing .
they're all happy ... and waving to their friends .
but the next day ... and this is the thing that they don't know ... they could be ... lying on the slab .
it's kind of , uh , harsh ... but it's kind of fun , too .
do you ever , um ...
what?
um ... you know .
be tempted , like ... well , fool around with the bodies?
oh !
no , i always wanted to ask .
i'm sorry if it makes you uncomfortable .
no , no .
people are very curious about that .
the worst thing that we do is we take the bodies , the grotesque ones , the really , really ugly ones ...
we make jokes about them , you know , harmless jokes , very harmless jokes , but we come up with some ... some very good , good jokes ... about them , my father and me .
but , you know , they're dead , and , uh , nobody can see that .
nobody hears anything .
hi , boys .
hi , mrs carver .
these jokes don't hurt anybody .
nobody knows we make them .
gilbert , i'm waiting for your call .

she'll eat the rest of him .
grandma , we have company .
so , do you want to eat?

if we get on the road by friday , we'll make colorado springs in time to catch them .
" have you ever been to colorado?
oh .
no , ma'am .
it must be wonderful .
it must be incredibly frustrating , then , to be stuck here in this place .
this place is as good a place as any .
" think so?
well , she should know .
becky's been just about everywhere there is to go , places i didn't even know existed .
i'm a worldly kind of girl .
me , i spent most of my whole life ... in the same spot .
why doesn't matter .
anyway , she encouraged me to get out .
now she can't stay put anywhere .
she's the smartest , most beautiful girl in the world .
isn't she?
isn't she beautiful?
isn't she beautiful?
i'm sorry .
she has this thing with beauty that ...
oh , yeah .
i noticed that .
i'm not into that , that whole external beauty thing , you know ,
'cause it ... it doesn't last .
right .
you're ... you know , eventually your face is going to get wrinkly ,
you'll get grey hair .
sure .
your boobs might sag .
you know , so what?
it's what you do that really matters .
mm hmm .
right?
yeah .

i love the sky .
it's so ...
limitless .
it is big .
it's very big .
big doesn't even sum it up , right?
that word big is so small .
you have to get those really giant words ... to describe the sky .
oh , um ...
what?
i have to go do this thing .
it's kind of a family thing .
do you want me to give you a ride back?
no , actually , i'm just going to sit here .
