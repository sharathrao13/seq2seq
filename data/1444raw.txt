think to yourself that every day is your last .
## [ piano playing softly ]
the hour to which you do not look forward ... will come as a welcome surprise .
as for me , when you want a good laugh , you will find me in fine state fat and sleek , [ wine pouring ]
a true hog of epicurus's herd .
and we find you cribbing lines from horace as well .
well done , john .
i must say , hannibal , speaking for the rest of the herd
i'm sorry .
for the symphony board .
oh .
these little soirees of yours are always the highlight of our year .
just so .
yes .
you're too kind .
i do feel a bit guiltyenjoying such a lovely evening ... when one of our musicians is still listed as a " missing person .
yes .
poor fellow .
shall i confess something wicked?
i can't help feeling just the tiniest bit , well , relieved .
it sounds awful , i know , but
iet's face it so does the man's playing .
hannibal , confess .
what is this divine looking amuse bouche?
ifl tell you ,
i'm afraid you won't even try it .
so , bon appetit .
bon appetit .
mmm .
special agent graham .
what an unexpected pleasure .
i'm sorry to bother you again , dr. lecter .
i know it's very late .
there's no bother .
we're both night owls , i think .
come in , please .
thank you .
let me take your coat .
so , what's on your mind?
we've been on the wrong track this whole time , doctor , you and i.
our whole profile's wrong .
we've been looking for someone with a crazy grudge ... and some kind of anatomical knowledge .
decertified doctors , med school dropouts , laid off mortuary workers .
from the precision of the cuts , yes , and his choice of souvenirs .
that's where we're off target .
he's not collecting body parts .
then why keep them? .
he's not keeping them .
he's eating them .
no , listen .
we were at molly's parents for new year's , and molly's dad was showing my son , josh , how to carve a roasted chicken .
yeah? .
he said , " the tender est part of the chicken ... is the oysters here on either side of the back .
i had never heard that expression before " oysters .
then suddenly , i had a flash of the third victim .
darcy taylor she was missing flesh from her back .
and then it hit me liver , kidney , tongue , thymus .
every single victim lost some body part used in cooking .
have you shared this with the bureau? .
no .
i i needed to see you first , but i'm right .
i know i'm right .
i'm i'm starting to be able to think like this one .
yeah , that's fascinating .
you know , i'd always suspected as much .
you are an eidetiker .
i'm i'm not psychic , doctor .
no , no , no .
this is different , more akin to artistic imagination .
you're able to assume the emotional point of view of other people , even those that might scare or sicken you .
it's a troubling gift , i should think .
how i'd love to get you on my couch .
something still doesn't make sense to me .
you're the best forensic psychiatrist i know .
and somehow , in all our time together , this possibility never occurred toyou .
well , i am only human , will .
perhaps i have made a mistake .
you don't strike me as a man who makes very many mistakes .
now i'm starting to think that i might no longer enjoy your full confidence .
no , no .
i did i didn't say that .
i didn't
i don't i don't know what i'm saying .
i'm very , very tired .
i i almost had it .
it'll come to you .
look , why don't you come back in the morning?
i'll clear some time on my schedule .
then we can get started on revising our profile .
sound good?
yeah .
you rest here , and i'll get your coat .
won't be a tick .
shh .
don't move .
you're in shock now .
i don't want you to feel any pain .
in a moment , you'll begin to be lightheaded , then drowsy .
don't resist .
it's so gentle , like slipping into a warm bath .
shh .
i regret it came to this , will .
but every game must have its ending .
shh .
remarkable boy .
i do admire your courage .
oh !
i think i'll eat your heart .
oh !
oh !
hey , dad .
someone's here .
hey .
you've got a beautiful setup here , will .
yeah .
it's good .
you know why i 'm here? .
yeah .
i can guess .
how much do you know? .
just what was in the miami herald and the times .
two families killed a month apart in their homes .
birmingham and atlanta .
circumstances were similar .
not similar .
the same .
what have you kept out of the papers? .
he smashes mirrors and uses the pieces .
wears latex gloves , so we've got no prints .
size 1 1 shoe .
he's not too comfortable with locks .
pried open a patio door in birmingham .
used a glass cutter in atlanta .
oh , and his blood's ab positive .
somebody hurt him? .
nope .
we typed him from semen and saliva .
he's a secretor .
tell me something , will .
you knew what this was .
did you ever consider picking up the phone and maybe giving me a call? .
you've got all the people you need .
you've got dortmund up at harvard .
you've got bloom in chicago .
and i've got you down here fixing fuckin 'boat motors .
yeah .
i like fixing boat motors .
i wouldn't be very useful to you anyway .
i don't think about this stuff anymore .
really? .
last two we had , you caught .
by doing the same things you and the other guys are doing .
that's not entirely true .
it's the way you think .
come on .
there's been a lot of bullshit about the way i think .
i've got technicians that can examine evidence , but you've got that other thing .
imagination , projection , whatever .
yeah .
i know you don't like that part of it .
you wouldn't like it either .
this freak killed the jacobis in birmingham on saturday night , february 25 .
full moon .
he killed the leeds family in atlanta a few nights ago .
march 28 .
that's one day short of a lunar month .
if we're lucky , we may have a little over three weeks before he does it again .
will , do you respect my judgment? .
yeah , of course .
i think we have a better chance to catch him fast if you help .
go to atlanta and look .
just look .
then help me brief the locals .
that's it .
crawford has the whole damn government .
what does he need you for?
he just wants me to look at some evidence , molly , give him another point of view .
it's it's a few days a week maybe and i'll be right back .
and you believe that? .
yes .
i mean look it , these kinds of cases come along very rarely .
and i've had experience .
yes , you have .
you're paid up , will .
all of us , even josh .
there's a chance that i can help them save some lives .
how do i say no to that? .
this one
this one will never see me or know my name .
i'll just help them find him .
the cops will have to take him down , not me .
i'll be in the back of the pack , molly .
i promise .
never in your life .
i know you .
come on .
come here .
come here .
i love you .
see you in a few days .
okay .
i'll call you tonight .
bye , dad .
where's the dog? .
no one heard barking .
there's nothing about it in the case file .
the intruder enters in the dark and cuts charles leeds's throat .
he shoots valerie leeds in the stomach as she's rising , disabling her but not killing her .
he leaves her to watch her husband die ... and turns and goes down the hall .
the children were st
the children were still in their beds when they were shot , which might indicate that he used a silencer .
he dragged the bodies into the master bedroom , but why bother? .
they were already dead , and none of them got the same ... extra attention as mrs. leeds .
small pieces of mirror were inserted in the orbital sockets of the victims .
this occurred postmortem .
why did you put mirrors in their eyes? .
the pieces of mirror make their eyes look alive .
he he wanted an audience .
he he wanted them all lined up watching him ... when he when he touched her .
when he touched her .
touch touch
talcum powder .
there was talcum powder .
mrs. leeds had traces of talcum found on her right inner thigh .
a complete search of the home led to no such matching talcum in the house .
you took your gloves off , didn't you? .
you son of a bitch .
you took your gloves off .
you touched her with your bare hand , and then you wiped her down .
but when the gloves were off , did you open her eyes? .
crawford .
hey .
are the leedses 'bodies still at the morgue? .
yeah .
who do we have down here that's really good with latent prints? .
atlanta p. d. , but they've already printed the bodies .
not the bodies .
tell them to check the eyes
mrs. leeds's eyes , even her corneas .
i i think he took his gloves off , jack .
i think he had to touch her .
jesus , will .
gentlemen , ladies .
this is what the subject's teeth look like .
the impressions came from bite marks on mrs. leeds .
this degree of crookedness ... plus the groove in this central incisor ... makes his bite signature unique .
fuckin 'shark .
knock it off .
we're grateful for the bureau's involvement .
they have a great deal of expertise in this area .
in particular , investigator graham does .
isn't that right , jack?
yes , sir .
anything you want to add , mr. graham? .
why don't you come on up to the front , please?
mrs. leeds and mrs. jacobi were the primary targets .
the others were killed just to complete his fantasy .
i know that might be hard to accept , given what you saw , but this was not random .
this wasn't some killing frenzy .
he was never out of control .
these attacks were highly organized , the women carefully chosen .
we don't know how he's choosing them or why .
they lived in different states , and they never met .
but there is some connection .
there's some common factor , and that's the key .
find out what that is , and we'll save lives .
'cause this one is gonna go on and on ... until we get smart or we get lucky .
he won't stop .
why not? .
because it makes him god .
would you give that up? .
you asked about the dog .
last night , a vet called us .
leeds and his oldest boy brought the dog in the afternoon before they were killed .
hada puncture wound to its abdomen .
vet had to put it down .
was the dog wearing a collar with the leedses 'address on it? .
no .
did the jacobis in birmingham have a dog? .
no dog .
they found a litter box in the basement .
cat droppings in it .
no cat .
if the cat was attacked , the jacobis might have buried it .
ask birmingham to check that backyard .
and tell them to use a methane probe .
it's faster .
yeah .
it's for you .
crawford .
carl , you're the light of my life .
would it hold up in court? .
okay .
great work .
they found a print on mrs. leeds's left eye partial thumb .
other than that , there's nothing else that i can tell you .
thank you very much for your time .
i cannot answer any more questions .
will graham .
remember me? .
freddy lounds .
i covered the lecter case for the tattler .
did the paperback .
yeah , i remember .
when'd they bring you in? .
what do you got? .
you think the tooth fairy will be even a bigger story than lecter? .
he's already beaten lecter's score .
hey , hey !
you write lying shit , and the tattler is an ass wipe !
just stay away from me .
get away , lounds .
go on .
how about an exclusive? .
sorry about that .
that guy snuck into the hospital and took those pictures of me .
remember? .
with the tubes hanging out of me .
i know .
forget that prick and give yourself some credit .
when we catch the tooth fairy , that print plus his teeth will burn him .
you did that , will .
the evidence was there , jack .
it was right there for anybody to see .
but nobody else did .
all i'm saying is that was very good work .
no .
good work would be seeing it all the way through and catching the guy .
and i can't do that .
i did what you asked me to do .
i'm going home .
i don't even have any idea who this guy is .
that that stuff i just gave them was broad strokes .
he's got no face to me .
that's what you said about garrett hobbs .
remember? .
and you figured him out .
no , i didn't .
you didn't? .
no .
i was stuck on hobbs .
yeah? .
i had help .
from lecter .
yeah .
jack , don't play games with me , man .
don't do it .
if there's something on your mind , come out and say it .
i'm just saying maybe we've got a resource we ought to look into .
have you been walking me through the rest of this just so you could ask me that? .
don't get mad at me .
i'm just doing my job .
if you know a better shortcut , let me know it .
if you think there's any chance he'll talk to me , i'll go myself .
if you tell me you can't handle it , god knows i'd understand that .
as a research subject , lecter has proven most disappointing .
he's simply impenetrable to psychological testing .
rorschach , thematic apperception [ drawer opens ]
he folds them into origami , as you see .
so you can imagine the stir your little visit is causing among my staff , mr. graham .
if you'd care to share some insights dr. chilton .
i'm sorry .
i've got a 4 .. 1 7 flight back to atlanta .
of course .
tell me , when you saw lecter's murders their style , so to speak were you able perhaps to reconstruct his fantasies? .
and if so , did you jot down any impressions? .
no .
let me be frank , mr. graham .
the first definitive analysis of lecter will be a publisher's wet dream .
i'd give you full credit of course .
oh .
well , damn it , man , you must have some advice .
you caught him .
what was your trick? .
i let him kill me .
that's the same atrocious after shave you wore in court .
i keep getting it for christmas .
christmas , yes .
did you get my card? .
i got it .
thank you .
so nice ofthe bureau's crime lab to forward that .
they wouldn't give me your home address .
dr. bloom sent me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of forensic psychiatry .
and? .
very interesting , even to a layman .
you say you're a layman ,
but it was you who caught me .
wasn't it , will? .
do you know how you did it?
i got lucky .
i don't think you believe that .
it's in the transcript .
what does it matter now? .
doesn't matter to me , will .
i need your advice , dr. lecter .
birmingham and atlanta .
you want to know how he's choosing them , don't you? .
i thought you'd have some ideas .
i'm asking you to tell me what they are .
why should i? .
there are things you don't have .
research materials , maybe even computer access .
i'd speak to the chief of staff .
ah , yes , dr. chilton .
gruesome , isn't he? .
he fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle .
if you recall , will , our last collaboration ended rather messily .
you get to see the file on this case , and there's another reason .
i'm all ears .
i thought you might enjoy the challenge find out if you're smarter than the person i'm looking for .
then , by implication , you think you're smarter than i am , since it was you who caught me .
no .
i know i'm not smarter than you .
then how did you catch me? .
you had ... disadvantages .
what disadvantages? .
you're insane .
you're very tanned , will .
and your hands are so rough , not like a cop's hands anymore .
and that shaving lotion is something a child would select .
has a little ship on the bottle , does it not? .
and how is young josh and the lovely molly? .
they're always in my thoughts , you know .
you will not persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity .
i don't think i'll persuade you at all .
you'll either do it oryou won't .
is that the case file? .
yes .
with photos? .
let me keep them , and i might consider it .
no .
do you dream much , will? .
good bye , dr. lecter .
you haven't threatened to take away my books yet .
give me the file then , and i'll tell you what i think .
i need one hour and privacy .
just like old times , hey , will? .
this is a very shy boy , will .
i'd love to meet him .
have you considered the possibility that he is disfigured ... or that he may believe he is disfigured? .
the mirrors .
yes .
you notice he smashes all the mirrors in the houses ... and not just enough to get the pieces he wants .
of course , those shards in their eyes so he can see himself there .
that's interesting .
no , it's not interesting .
you thought of that before .
i had considered it .
what about the women? .
uh huh .
dead mere puppets .
you need to see them living , the way they caught his eye .
that's impossible .
almost , not quite .
what were they ards like? .
big backyards .
fenced , some hedges .
why? .
because if this pilgrim feels a special relationship with the moon , he might like to go outside and look at it .
you ever seen blood in the moonlight , will? .
it appears quite black .
if one were nude , say , it would be better to have outdoor privacy for that sort of thing .
you think they ards might be a factor when he selects victims? .
oh , yes , and there will be more of them of course victims .
so you'll be wanting lots of these little chin wags , i take it .
i might not have time .
i do .
i have oodles .
i need your opinion now .
then here's one .
you stink of fear and that cheap lotion .
you stink of fear , will , but you're not a coward .
you fear me , but still you came here .
you fear this shy boy , yet still you seek him out .
don't you understand , will? .
you caught me because we are very much alike .
without our imaginations , we'd be like all those other poor dullards .
fear is the price of our instrument , but i can help you bear it .
you gettin 'his face? .
yeah .
okay , you got it? .
all right , let's get the fuck outta here .
you're sure you're okay?
yeah .
yeah , i'm okay .
what do you think he meant by " see them living "? .
i don't know .
i don't know .
maybe nothing .
it's hard to separate his bullshit , but i'm gonna make another pass at the leeds house .
## [ honky tonk piano ]
duchess , no .
who's that?
get 'em , duchess .
get'em , duch .
go get'em , duch .
go get 'em , girl .
and ... action !
charlie !
how did you
hey !
hey , gang .
he's a crazy man .
how is everybody doin '?
oh , just fine .
home from the store .
hi , daddy .
that's my girl .
hi , daddy .
hi , honey .
billy .
hi , dad .
and , sweetie .
i am not ready for my close up , mr. de mille .
well , what do you think? .
get close .
get closer .
a little closer .
i think maybe we'd better put these kids to bed a little early tonight .
they seem tired .
don't you think?
here we are at the pool party .
what are you doin '? .
stop it .
you stop it .
i 'm telling my mother on you .
now i get my kiss .
you want a kiss? .
i want a kiss the big , romantic kind .
won't no body get in through here again .
i'll " guaran damn tee " it .
why didn't he break in down there? .
it's more hidden .
hell , that door's got dead bolts .
reckon he was in too big a hurry .
no .
this one doesn't hurry .
you sat right here , didn't you? .
you watched the children bury the cat .
then you waited for dark .
you're proud .
you had to sign your work .
grandma .
grandma?
i'm sorry .
oh , francis !
i've never seen a child as dirty and disgusting as you .
look atyou !
you're soaking wet .
get out ofmy bed !
no !
go back up to your room .
grandma , you're hurt in 'me .
shut up , you filthy little beast !
i should've put you in an orphanage , grandson or not .
you hurting me !
into the bathroom .
take off your nightshirt and wipe your self off .
hurry up !
now give me my scissors from the medicine chest .
please , no !
take that filthy thing in your hand and stretch it out .
no , grandma .
please !
now !
look down .
do you want me to cut it off?
do you?
no , grandma !
i pledge you my word , francis .
if you ever make your bed dirty again , i'll cut it off .
you understand?
i 'i i be ... good boy .
i 'i i be ... good boy .
i promise .
good morning , will .
so nice of you to visit again .
he carved this on a tree near the jacobi house ... with a buck knife .
the same one later used on charles leeds .
yes .
yeah .
take a walk with me .
he had a second tool too , a bolt cutter .
he used that to clear his view .
but? .
but i don't think that's what he brought it for .
too heavy , too awkward and he had to carry it a long way .
and what do we make of that symbol? .
asian studies at langley identified it as a chinese character .
it appears on a mah jongg piece .
it marks the red dragon .
red dragon .
correct .
this boy begins to interest me .
doctor , we don't know what greater meaning this symbol might
do you like my little exercise cage , will? .
my so called lawyer is always nagging dr. chilton for better accommodations .
i don't know which is the greater fool .
perhaps if you could offer some insight  a robin redbreast in a cage !
puts all heaven in a rage .
ever been a redbreast , will? .
of course you have .
i'm allowed 30 minutes in here once a week .
get to the point .
i think he meant to use the bolt cutter to enter the house , but he didn't .
instead , he broke in through the patio doors .
the noise woke jacobi , and he had to shoot him on the stairs .
that wasn't planned .
it was sloppy , and that's not like him .
hmm .
we mustn't judge too harshly , will .
it was his first time .
have you never felt a sudden rush of panic? .
hmm? .
yeah , that's the fear we talked about .
it takes experience to master it .
you sensed who i was back when i was committing what you call my crimes .
yes .
you were hurt not by a fault in your perception or instincts , but because you failed to act on them until it was too late .
you could say that .
but you're wiser now .
yes .
imagine what you would do , will , if you could go back in time .
put two in your head before you could palm that stiletto? .
very good , will .
you know , i believe we're makin 'progress .
and that's what our pilgrim is doing .
he is refining his methods .
he is evolving .
oh , the case file mentioned videos of the leeds family .
i'd like to see those .
no .
it would be obscene .
why not? .
you don't make it easy , do you? .
still , one aims to please .
i'll call you if i think of anything else .
would you perhaps like to leave me your home number? .
that's the end of our session , doctor .
for now .
it was only his first time .
already in atlanta he did much better .
rest assured , my dear will , this one will give you plenty of exercise .
my love to molly and josh .
go to the back of the cell , dr. lecter .
face the wall .
if you turn around before you hear the lock snap , you'll get a dart .
understood? .
yes , indeed .
you got ten minutes to talk to your lawyer .
starting now .
thanks so much , barney .
hello? .
dr. lecter? .
i have those documents you requested .
robes , robespierre , robin .
robin , call for .
robin , fainting .
ta da !
redbreast in a cage .
406 . 9 .
ah .
a robin redbreast in a cage !
puts all heaven in a rage .
yeah , that's it .
william blake , auguries of innocence .
hmm .
think you got it? .
yeah , we should have .
um , we have some books of blake's paintings too .
wanna see'em? .
yeah , thanks .
psychology department , university of chicago .
dr. bloom's office .
oh , hi .
this is bob greer at blaine and edwards publishing .
dr. bloom asked me to send a copy of the psychiatrist and the law to will graham .
his assistant was supposed to give me the address and phone number , but , darn it , she never did .
uh , see , i'm just a temp .
linda will be in on monday .
gosh , and i have to catch fedex in about five minutes .
i hate to bother dr. bloom about it at home , 'cause he told linda to send it , and i don't want to get her into trouble .
it's right there in her rolodex or whatever .
i'll dance at your wedding if you read it to me .
oh , i don't know .
i'm really not supposed to .
be a darling and flip that little ol 'rascal , and i won't take up any more of your time .
graham , comma , will .
oh , all right .
just a minute .
um , gordon , graham .
it doesn't give the address of the house .
what does it have , dear? .
f. b. i. , 935 pennsylvania avenue , northwest , washington , d. c.
yeah? .
oh , and let's see .
here it is .
p. o. box 3680 , marathon , florida .
marathon .
yeah .
that's fine .
you're an angel .
i'm francis dolarhyde .
i've come for the package of infrared .
right .
put your back against the door and come forward three steps ... till you feel tile under your feet .
and there's a stool just on the left .
same mr. d. who's head of tech services .
am i right? .
uh huh .
i'm reba mcclane .
just a second more , i will get you some light .
okay .
here we go .
so , what do you need the i. r. for? .
it's for the zoo .
they want to photograph the nocturnal animals .
that's great .
i love animals .
i gotta warn you though .
this stuff is pretty sensitive .
it can be mean to handle .
but i guess i don't need to tell you that .
hey , reba .
oh , mister d.
whoa .
i'm not interrupting anything here , am i? .
no , ralph .
listen , reba , it's starting to spritz outside .
how about i giveyou a lift home? .
you ride a motorcycle , ralph .
how's that gonna help me with the rain? .
well , i thought maybe ... stop off someplace , have ourselves a little sundowner .
i've already got a ride .
that's cool .
that's cool .
no " problemo .
if there's anything i hate worse than pity , it's fake pity especially from a walking hard on like ralph mandy .
sorry .
i have no pity .
ride with me .
thanks , but i take the bus all the time .
mandy is a fool .
ride with me .
for my pleasure .
you wanna come in? .
i'll fix us a drink .
maybe another time .
i will ... come in .
when is the zoo project? .
maybe next week .
they'll call .
i love zoos .
in fact , one of my earliest memories is seeing a cougar when i was about five .
i didn't lose my sight till i was seven .
diphtheria .
could you hand me that knife? .
anyway , i've always tried to hang on to what that cougar looked like .
although by now , to tell you the truth , what i see in my head ... is probably not the least bit like a cougar .
it's more like a donkey or a goat .
you know , sometimes i'm not so sure i really saw him .
maybe he's just something i dreamed up .
you okay? .
uh huh .
you don't say much , do you? .
um , no , i guess not .
let's talk about something for a minute ... and get it out of the way , okay? .
i can hear that you've had ... some kind of soft palate repair .
but i understand you fine because you speak very well .
if you don't wanna talk to me , that's cool .
but i hope that you will because ...
i know what it's like to have people always thinking that you're different .
mm hmm .
well ... that's good .
may i touch your face? .
i wanna know if you're smiling or frowning .
i wanna know whether i should just shut up or not .
take my word that i'm smiling .
i have to go .
if i offended you , i didn't mean to .
no .
i've been to their house , but i don't have a sense what the jacobis were like .
it would help me if i could see some of their personal effects .
diaries , letters .
do you have those things , mr. metcalf? .
oh , i sure do .
i mean , other than one or two little keepsakes niles jacobi got .
that would be mr. jacobi's surviving son by his first wife? .
yeah , that's right .
as their executor , i keep all that stuffhere in the office , along with some of the smaller valuables , till after probate .
but , uh , birmingham p. d. 's been all through it .
could you pack those things and ship 'em up to me? .
i hate to ask .
i know it's a pain in the ass .
ah , hell .
probate judge is an old golfin 'buddy of mine .
son , just tell me you're gonna nail that son of a bitch .
we're doing our best .
will?
hey , thanks , mr. metcalf .
thanks .
a note hidden in lecter's cell .
sounds like a fan letter mailed by the tooth fairy .
he wants lecter's approval .
he's curious about you .
he's asking questions .
i've scrambled a chopper .
does lecter know we have the note? .
not yet .
it was found during a routine cleanup .
they don't open his mail?
can't .
need a warrant .
x rays only .
where's lecter now?
still in the holding cage .
can he see his cell from there?
no .
he 's been there almost half an hour .
soon he 'll start to wonder what's wrong .
we gotta buy time , jack .
dr. chilton? .
yes? .
cal i your building superintendent or engineer whoever's in charge .
tell them to pull the circuit breakers on lecter's hall .
have the super walk down the hall past the holding cell carrying tools .
he'll be in a hurry , pissed off , too busy to answer any questions .
got it? .
and don't forget .
don't touch the note .
okay? .
graham's on his way .
listen up !
we've got a note coming in on the fly , possibly from the tooth fairy .
number one priority .
it has to go back to lecter's cell ... within the hour unmarked .
we'll need hair and fiber , latent prints , then documents .
i'll walk it through myself .
let's go , people .
my dear dr. lecter
i wanted to tell you i'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me .
and when i learned of your vast correspondence ,
i thought , " dare i?
of course i do .
i don't believe you'll tell them who i am .
besides , what particular body i currently occupy is trivial .
the important thing is what i am becoming .
i know that you alone can understand this transformation .
i have some things i'd love to show you , if circumstances permit .
i hope we can correspond .
i have admired you for years and have a complete collection ofyour press notices .
actually , i think of them as unfair reviews .
as unfair as mine .
they do like to sling demeaning nicknames , don 't they?
the tooth fairy . " what could be more inappropriate?
it would shame me for you to read that ... if i didn 't know you had suffered the same distortions in the press .
i 'm fed up with this bloody stupid building .
every day , something breaking .
i swear they ought to tear the whole fuckin 'place down .
how much longer do we have? .
ten minutes max .
instructions for answering are probably in the section lecter tore out .
but i don't get it .
why not just throw the whole note away? .
it was full of compliments .
couldn't bear to part with them .
now we can mash just a little .
you're so sly .
but so am i.
aniline dyes and color edinks are transparent to infrared .
these could be the tips of 't's " here and here .
on the end , that's a " p " or possibly an " r.
maybe this is where he's telling lecter how to answer him .
jack , there's only one safe way to carry on a conversation that's one way blind .
publication .
wait a minute .
we know this sweetheart reads the tattler .
that's in his note , right? .
the tooth fairy " they made that up .
three " t's " and an " r " in tattler .
so how do you communicate through a tabloid? .
you got what? .
news stories .
personals .
personals .
damn it .
what if the killer wants lecter to answer him through the personal columns? .
that could be it .
we're gonna need proofs of those pages before the tattler's published .
i'm on it .
investigator graham interests me .
not your standard gumshoe , is he?
more alert , purposeful looking .
you should have taught him not to meddle .
forgive the stationary .
i chose it because it will dissolve very quickly ... if you should have to swallow it .
if i hear from you next time , i might send you something wet .
until then , dear doctor ,
i remain your most ... avid fan .
the t attler got an ad order signed 666 .
balti more postmark on the envelope .
it's set to run this afternoon .
chicago field office is sending the text through now .
dear pilgrim " that's it .
doctor called him a pilgrim when we talked .
you honor me .
you're very beautiful .
christ .
i offer a hundred prayers for your safety .
