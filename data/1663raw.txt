i almost fell .

i'm sorry .
i ran over your dog .
rita .
a german shepherd .
that's possible .
she disappeared yesterday .
she's in my car .
alive .
i don't know what to do .
should i take her to a veterinarian?
as you wish .
if i ran over your daughter , would you be so indifferent?
i have no daughter , miss .
go away .
don't close the door .
she's fine .
we stitched her up .
otherwise , she has a few bruises .
she'll need some rest .
she's pregnant .
will you take her or leave her here?
i'll take her .
we'll help you carry her .
marc ...
are you alone?
no .
tell him something .
did you hear?
i have a dog .
a dog .
i ran her over .
michel , i'm sorry .
that wasn't funny .
no , it wasn't .
i knew it was a joke .
i could see you laughing .
do you remember how we met?
i remember ...
we're lucky i stepped out during the break .
that's true .
valentine , return the dog .
i tried .
the owner doesn't want it .
who is he?
i hear an alarm .
it's my car .
wait for me to turn it off .
i'm in a rush .
i understand .
move .
move .
they prefer these .
a breath of life " .
which do you prefer?
i like this one .
me too .
25 by 65 feet .
will people recognize you?
who?
who are you thinking of?
not you .
that's a bad sign .
i think i know why i won .
goodbye .
so long .
you're back already .
the mailman left money for you .
who sent it?
i have no idea .
isn't that your brother?
or someone who looks like him .
what a shame .
does your family read this paper?
i don't know .
thank you .
goodbye .
can i speak to marie , please?
it's valentine .
will you see marc soon?
tonight , probably .
tell him to call me at any hour .
i'll let you run around .
but don't run away .
you promise?
go on .
excuse me .
my dog ran away .
call her .
she's yours .
was it you?
for the vet .
you found my address?
that was easy .
you don't know the prices .
it cost 130 francs .
you sent me 600 .
wait .
i'll get the change .
what about rita?
she's a very intelligent dog .
take her .
you don't want her?
i want nothing .
then stop breathing .
good idea .
you don't breathe anymore?
if you don't come , you'll never see me again .
but today is sunday .
yesterday was saturday and we were together .
i'm sorry , sir .
we're about to have lunch .
i ask one thing of you : don't call me " sir " .
talk to me like yesterday .
call me pierrot .
call me " my love " .
say " my love " ...
sir , let me change rooms .
pierre , i'm alone now .
so am i.
far from you .
i want you to come .
i can't be alone ...
i saw you yesterday .
i miss you too .
understand that .
i don't want to .
i'm thinking of you .
you're naked in front of the mirror .
but for someone else , not for me .
i want to kiss you .
i lean forward ,
i touch your lips ...
what are you doing?
i'm spying .
what?
i'm listening to my neighbors 'phone calls .
you cut it off just as it was getting interesting .
you don't find it entertaining?
it's disgusting .
yes .
what's more , it's illegal .
your 30 francs .
one minute , miss .
you're persuaded you are right .
yes .
then why don't you do anything?
what?
can't i touch your scar ,
like yesterday?
go see this man .
tell him someone listens to his conversations .
while you're at it , tell him it's me .
i will .
it's that house .
may i see your husband?
he's upstairs on the phone .
let me shut off the gas .
come in , please .
have a seat .
he'll be right down .
caroline , don't play ... ... with the phone .
daddy's talking .
excuse me .
i'm at the wrong address .
this is number 22 .
i'm very sorry .
no problem .
have a nice day .
goodbye .
i'll call you later .
you lost this .
so?
did you tell him?
would you like something to drink?
no , i wouldn't .
i came back ...
i came back to ask you something .
don't do this any more .
i've done it all my life .
what were you?
a cop?
worse .
a judge .
a judge?
you've never seen one for real?
would you like to try?
it makes ... a lovely sound .
i don't know whether i was on the good or the bad side .
here , at least , i know where the truth is .
my point of view is better than in a courtroom .
no .
everyone deserves a private life .
of course .
why did you stop short?
why didn't you tell him?
because he has a sweet wife , devoted to him?
and a little daughter who loves him?
so you couldn't .
did you feel remorse ... or were you afraid to do harm?
maybe both .
let me tell you .
it matters little whether i spy or you tell them .
sooner or later , he'll jump out a window , or she'll find out everything .
someone will tell their daughter and it will be living hell .
what can we do about it?
why are you so quiet?
does this remind you of something?
yes .
what?
say it .
a boy i know .
a boy you know who ... found out his mother was a whore?
who learned ... he's not his father's son .
he was fifteen .
that man's daughter ... she knows too .
stay a minute .
why?
the light is beautiful .
personal weather reports .
i'm driving to turin tomorrow .
i checked .
the weather will be fine to chamonix .
from chamonix to the tunnel , it may snow .
and after the tunnel ... one minute ...
i know the weather all over europe .
up to turin , the weather will be fine .
leave early to avoid the snow .
this service is a great idea .
thank you .
goodbye .
personal weather reports .
it's me .
did you get any sleep?
a little .
i didn't tell you .
by telephone it may be easier .
it was really great .
we'd never made love so well , so long .
we learned something .
me from you .
you from me .
when i woke up , you were still sleeping .
like a child .
i'm older than you .
one year !
no , two .
okay .
two .
when i saw you , i got scared .
what is this leading to?
you sound a little down .
are you nervous about your exams?
about what i'm going to do .
will it be enough for you?
why not go bowling?
i opened all my books .
maybe .
do you have a coin?
yes .
flip it .
tails is bowling .
heads is penal code .
tails .
bowling .
i'll work for an hour , then i'll call you .
or i will .
i'll wait .
if i go out , it's just to buy cigarettes .
you didn't listen?
what a shame .
it was romantic .
i heard the beginning .
they're in love .
yes .
he hasn't met the right woman yet .
how do you know?
i watch them from my window .
you think i'm a bastard?
yes .
come look .
he bought a telephone in japan that uses another wavelength .
my radio can't pick it up .
too bad .
i think he's responsible for most of the heroin trade in geneva .
we have nothing on him .
he never takes risks .
do you like him?
very much .
i'll call him .
you have his phone number?
you deserve to die .
what did i do?
here's his phone number .
if you feel like saying mean things to him , don't hesitate .
at 10 o'clock , i turned off the lights .
i couldn't sleep .
next program .
not very interesting .
i kept tossing and turning .
it kept hurting .
it still does .
i haven't done the errands .
i'm sorry , mother .
i have no milk or bread .
i bought you some .
i put it in the freezer .
i ate it all .
you didn't eat 7 loaves ... ... in 4 days .
i'm sick of this .
go do her errands .
maybe you'd feel better .
maybe she's the one ... ... who'd feel better .
why did you pick up rita?
because i'd run over her .
she was bleeding .
otherwise , you'd have felt guilty .
you'd have dreamt of a dog with a crushed skull .
yes .
so who did you do it for?
don't bother doing that lady's errands .
she has everything she needs .
she wants to see her daughter .
she already came 5 times , when her mother faked a heart attack .
after she dies , i'll have to call the daughter .
she doesn't believe her any more .
you're mistaken .
about what?
about everything .
everything .
people aren't bad .
it's not true .
yes .
they may be weak sometimes ...
the boy who learned his father wasn't his father ... your boyfriend or your brother?
my brother .
how old is he?
16 .
how long has he been shooting up?
how do you know?
it wasn't hard to guess .
i can only feel pity for you .
maybe you don't know .
your dog is pregnant .
it's valentine .
hello , darling .
mom , did marc come?
two days ago .
with his girlfriend .
do you know her?
yes .
marie .
we're all together .
they're watching tv .
i'm sorry i can't be there .
too bad .
it's like old times .
your brother's a good boy .
can i talk to him?
marc !
he's coming .
call me , mom .
i love you .
hi , valentine .
thanks for going there .
we're leaving tomorrow .
i can't stand it .
mom didn't see the paper?
i don't think so .
she'd never believe it ...
you're right .
you should go home .
bye .
call me , michel .
please , call me .
dld you see the picture?
the picture?
is that you , jacques?
isn't it amazing?
you didn't see it?
i forgot .
i've had a hard day .
come meet us .
it'll relax you .
where?
not bad !
i'm sorry to bother you ...
someone played a stupid prank .
i can't get in .
those kids ...
turks .
always trouble .
i don't know .
they stuck chewing gum in my lock .
tweezers .
it's me .
michel ...
i just called .
there was no answer .
someone stuck chewing gum in my lock .
i heard the phone .
chewing gum?
i did an ad for chewing gum .
that must be why .
i told you not to .
they take advantage of you .
forget it .
there was no answering machine .
all i want is peace .
a life of peace and quiet .
life won't be peaceful with me .
did you meet someone?
no .
i'm waiting for you .
why didn't you answer before?
i told you .
i couldn't get inside .
i understand .
how are you?
i'm going to hungary next week .
what are you doing?
i'm going to bed .
go ahead !
go on !
are you there?
michel , are you there?
it's starting again ...
are you asleep?
no , i'm not .
get into bed .
are you in bed?
i'm taking a shower .
i was getting undressed .
no one is helping you?
valentine , are you there?
no .
goodnight .
i knew you'd make it .
did they ask the question?
from the book you dropped in the street .
you don't like it?
yes .
very much .
what will be the first judgement i sign?
civil hearing .
the inhabitants of pinchat against joseph kern .
please enter .
i'd like number 432 .
van den budenmayer .
did i pronounce it right?
yes .
this one?
i just sold the last one .
i'll have others this afternoon .
i can set one aside .
whose paper is this?
yours .
i came ...
i saw the newspaper ...
i want you to know i didn't tell a soul .
i know .
no one .
not the police .
no one .
i know .
i know who it was .
who?
it was me .
you asked me to .
won't you come in?
let me show you something .
one , two , three , four , five , six .
seven?
seven .
won't you have some pear brandy?
i've had it for ages , but i've never had an occasion .
to my health .
why did you do it?
why did i turn myself in?
yes .
to see what you'd do once you saw it in your paper .
you thought ... ... i would come?
after our last conversation , i thought so .
why?
do you expect something from me?
yes .
before you left , you mentioned pity .
afterwards , i realized it was disgust .
will you sit down for a moment?
will you smile for me?
the day you left , you cried .
i cried .
and i shut off my radio .
i sat down at my desk .
the fountain pen i'd used all my life was out of ink , so i took a pencil and wrote letters to my neighbors and to the police .
i mailed them that evening .
while you were sleeping soundly .
i wasn't sleeping .
i had gone bowling .
do you remember that couple's conversation?
the boy and the girl?
i remember .
they wanted to go too .
that same evening .
maybe you were right next to them .
maybe .
you didn't like her .
it's almost over .
i was right .
you seem happy about it .
did you provoke it?
yes or no?
because of my eavesdropping and my trial , the girl met another man .
good day .
since then , she's been alone .
i asked my brother to go see her .
he stayed three days .
in one week i'm going to england .
i'm abandoning my mother and my brother .
every day he gets a little worse .
i shouldn't leave .
leave .
it's your destiny .
you can't live your brother's life for him .
i love him .
if only i could help .
you can .
be .
what do you mean?
that's all : be .
do you like flying?
then take the ferry .
i've never taken one .
it's less expensive and healthier .
that's a good idea .
do you like it?
today is my birthday .
i didn't know .
35 years ago today , at about the same time , 5 o'clock ,
i acquitted a man .
a sailor .
one of my first big cases .
it was a tough time in my life .
i have since realized i made a mistake .
he was guilty .
i'm all out of bulbs .
what happened to him?
i did my own investigation .
he's married with three children .
a grandson .
he is living in peace .
so you did what was necessary .
and you did it well .
don't you understand?
you saved him .
perhaps .
but how many others could i have acquitted?
even guilty?
deciding what is true and what isn't now seems to me ... ... a lack of modesty .
vanity?
vanity .
can i have a drop?
to you !
if i had to go to court ... are there still judges like you?
you won't go to court .
justice doesn't deal with the innocent .
see that?
it's the sixth window they've broken .
the wavelength has been changed .
i can no longer eavesdrop .
where is the broom?
in the kitchen closet .
put the stone on the piano .
you're not afraid?
i wonder what i'd do in their place .
the same thing .
you'd throw stones?
in their place?
of course .
and that goes for everyone i judged .
given their lives , i would steal ,
i'd kill , i'd lie .
of course i would .
all that because i wasn't ... ... in their shoes , but mine .
is there someone you love?
have you ever loved?
yesterday i dreamt ...
i dreamt of you .
you were 40 or 50 years old , and you were happy .
do your dreams come true?
it's been years since i dreamt something nice .
stay there !
i bought a ticket for the ferry .
i arrive in england next wednesday .
at 7 : 30 a . m .
why the ferry?
so i can visit my mother near calais .
i'll meet you at 8 : 00 .
i'm happy you're coming .
michel , tell me ... do you love me?
i think so .
you love me or you think so?
it's the same thing .
the battery .
auguste !
personal weather reports .
i've tried calling for a few days .
i was sick .
i'm sorry .
what will the weather be on the english channel next week?
wonderful .
sunny , a slight breeze , chilly in the morning .
why are you laughing?
i intend to go there .
even farther .
for your work?
no , for pleasure .
on a yacht .
it's a nice sail .
yes , very .
you'll be closing?
i'll have to .
that's too bad .
it was a good idea .
goodbye .
we told you not to smile !
be serious !
can you send an invitation to this address?
just one person?
are you okay?
so long .
have a good time .
there's no make up remover?
here .
everyone noticed ... ... that guy .
during the entire show i kept staring at him .
you came .
you knew the invitation came from me?
i'd hoped so .
did you look for me?
during the entire show .
i'm leaving tomorrow .
i wanted to say goodbye .
goodbye .
i'd like you to tell me in detail ... ... the dream you had .
you were 50 years old and you were happy .
in this dream ... was there someone else?
there was .
who?
you woke up and you smiled at someone next to you .
i don't know who .
that's what will happen?
in 20 or 25 years?
yes .
what else do you know?
who are you?
a retired judge .
i feel something important is happening around me .
and it scares me .
is that better?
i used to come here often .
where did you usually sit?
where i sat today .
that's why you couldn't see me .
one day , during the intermission , the elastic holding my books broke .
one of them , a big one , fell down ... somewhere around here .
it was just before my exams .
i ran down immediately .
the book had opened to a certain page .
i read a few sentences .
it was the question they asked during my exam .
getting out of the house did you good .
i had to recharge the battery .
it was dead .
the storm .
lousy coffee .
i was wondering ... ... why you mentioned that sailor .
do you know why?
yes .
because ... ... you didn't want to tell me something more important .
about the woman that you loved .
she betrayed you .
she betrayed you , and you never understood why .
and you kept on loving her .
how do you know all this?
it wasn't hard to guess .
what was she like?
she graduated two years before me .
she was blond , delicate , radiant , with a long neck .
her clothing and her furniture were all light colored .
in the foyer there was a mirror in a white frame .
it was in that mirror , one night , that i saw her white legs spread , with a man between them .
why ... ... did that happen?
do you know?
this man , whose name was hugo holbling ,
could offer her what she wanted .
they left .
i followed them .
i crossed france , the channel ...
i was ... humiliated .
until the day she died in an accident .
since then , i've never loved another woman .
yes .
i stopped believing .
maybe i never met the woman ...
maybe you're the woman i never met .
the story doesn't end there .
no .
a while ago ,
i was given a difficult case .
hugo holbling .
the same man .
he'd come back here .
i'm closing up .
did you see a woman with a bucket?
the storm flooded the wardrobe .
if you see her , tell her i'm upstairs .
you shouldn't have taken the case .
i didn't want to .
at first , i wanted to kill him .
i would have , if it would have changed something .
now , he was waiting for my verdict .
he was building a covered market which caved in .
several people died .
i said he was guilty .
it was a legal sentence .
afterwards , i asked for early retirement .
did you see her?
i'm always running after her !
milana !
there you are !
give me the buckets .
they're heavy .
you seemed to like my pear brandy .
i have another favor to ask you .
i'll be gone two or three weeks .
i'll come see you afterwards .
please give me one of the puppies .
will the fashion show be on tv?
probably .
i better buy a tv .
i have one i never use .
my brother can bring it to you .
his name is marc .
i'd like to meet him .
i'll see you soon .
goodbye .
do you have your ticket?
where do i go?
this deck .
that corridor .
excuse me , i'm lost .
f38?
the deck above .
