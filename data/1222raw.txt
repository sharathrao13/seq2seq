she's the most successful president in the history of our network and for the past five years has kept us at the very top of the ratings .
she's our maverick , our wild card , and today she's gonna take us right to the edge .
joanna eberhart .
way to go , joanna !
thank you all so much .

joanna !
that feels good , especially coming from such a fantastic group of people from all across our great nation , our network affiliates .
give yourselves a great big hand .
you deserve it .
and i want a big , fat christmas bonus .
just kidding , but not really , because ... ... i am so excited , i am so on fire , i am so guts and glory passionate about what i am about to show you .
so get ready , because on monday nights the whole world will be watching a man , a woman and a buzzerl
are you ready for the final gender challenge?
who makes more money?
i do .
who enters ironman triathlons every year and wins?
i do .
who secretly wishes they were married to a hot , sexy lesbian?
i dol i dol
it's taral
and ... ... on thursdays ...
no , this is not just a tv show .
no , this is a breakthrough , a breakout , a break all the rules and bring on the emmys mega smashl
yesl
can i present to you this planet's ultimate reality phenomenon?
i can do better !
we will all be right there as happily married couples are flown first class to a tropical island paradise where they will be completely surrounded by professional prostitutes .
and at the end of the week ...
well , let's take a peek .
well , it's been a week , and hank , our personnel manager from omaha , has spent the entire seven days with vanessa , our call girl and exotic dancer .
yeah , it's been amazing .
and i'll admit we've had some fun in the hot tub and all .
but you wanna know something , billy?
all we did was talk ... ... because i love my wife ... ... and the only place i want to be is back in omaha with my barbara .
tough break , nessa .
and barbara , you spent monday with rocky , our bodybuilder and male escort ,
tuesday through thursday with the entire cast of the xxx film hung jury , and you spent the entire weekend with tonkiro .
and now it's time for the final decision .
barbara , it's yours to make .
is it gonna be omaha?
or " oma hunks "?
well ... ... before i came on this show i only had sex with one man , and that was usually hank .
i love hank deeply and forever with all my heart , and i would never do anything to hurt him .
but i can do betterl
the battle of the sexes , as old as time but as ...
why?
excuse me?
why did you do it?
oh , my god , it's hank from i can do better !
hank , everyone .
no , stop it .
i love barbara .
i had a family .
i had a life .
hank ,
i know it hurts .
love isn't easy .
relationships aren't easy , not for anyone .
but now you know the truth about barbara , and you are gonna move on with your life .
and you're gonna meet someone wonderful , and america is gonna love you .
yeah .
i've got a great idea for another hot new show .
well , tell it to us .
it's called ... ... let's kill all the women .
he's got a gunl
joanna , are you all right?
i am great .
raring to go .
the police were sensational .
and not a scratch .
you haven't heard?
about what?
that man , hank .
right before he tried to kill you , he went to see his ex wife and five of her new boyfriends .
he did?
he shot all of them .
the wife is in critical condition , and four of the guys are on life support .
tonkiro?
he's fine .
thank god .
so you know what this means .
of course .
we pay for all of their medical treatment , every penny .
we get them the very best therapist , childcare , rehab , whatever they need , and then we fly them to new york , first class , for a prime time special ,
let the healing begin .
you're not listening .
we can't wear this .
the lawsuits alone may bankrupt the network .
and all your new shows , the whole lineup , the affiliates won't touch them .
we have shareholders .
we can't let you sink the network .
but we wish you only the best .
of course .
thank you for being so classy and taking this so well .
joanna , we just wanted to say that this is so not fair .
goodbye , everybodyl
all the bestl
jo?
walter .
what happened?
well , you've had a complete nervous collapse .
and the doctors say there's a lot of work to do , but you're gonna be just fine .
oh , and pete made this for you .
oh , that's so sweet .
isn't it?
and i wanted you to know that the minute i heard the news ,
i called the network and i quit .
you did that for me?
of course .
i know i was only a vice president , but i could never work for those people , not after the way they treated you .
oh , walter ...
and do you remember what today is?
it's our anniversary .
oh , walter ... ... l'm so sorry .
maybe that man who tried to shoot me , maybe he was right .
maybe i've become the wrong kind of woman .
maybe i've made all of the wrong decisions .
could we get away and start over?
and get it right , our marriage?
but why are we moving?
to connecticut?
we're moving so that we can all kick back and have a great new life in this beautiful new town .
name?
kresby .

i call it cozy .
and it's also a smart house .

we need juice , we need juice , we need juice .
the system also monitors all the commodes .
where it will test your urine for blood sugar , protein and body fat .
flush toilets .

i'm gonna go check my room .
me too .
now , walter , will you be commuting?

oh , look , it's the puppy .
robo rover 3000 .
come on , boy .

joanna .
the town is over 200 years old .
it was founded by george washington , and martha just loved it .
stepford is connecticut's family paradise .
it has no crime , no poverty and no pushing .
what is that?
up on the hill?
well , that's our stepford men's association .
where all our wonderful guys can get together and stay out of our hair .

where do the women go?
to the simply stepford day spa .
good morning , ladies .
good morning , claire .
joanna .
good morning , joanna .
are we ready to work out?
oh , yes .
places and poles , please .
wait , you work out dressed like this?
well , of course .
whatever we do , we always want to look our very best .
i mean , why , imagine if our husbands saw us in worn , dark , urban sweat clothes with stringy hair and almost no makeup?
oh , good heavens .
now , today you are in for a special treat because we are working on a series of exercises which i've personally invented , based on simple household tasks .
i call my program clairobics .

that is not cobbler .
roger , could we ...?
could we reel it in , like , a couple of hundred yards?

your hummer?
it's a sweet ride .
it's roomy .
here you go .
we need an ambulance .
you shouldn't be moving her .
she might need oxygen , paramedics .
everything isn't always about you , jo .
walter .
she'll be fine .
it's too much sun .
she's dehydrated .
dehydrated?
are you crazy?
jo .
i'm sorry about this , mike .
joanna .
joanna , this is a very special moment .
i would like you to meet ...
mike wellington .
my husband .
oh ...
and you must be the famous joanna .
you're even prettier than in the newspapers .
they don't do you justice .
excuse me , that woman is very sick .
thank you .
i should be going with her .
she'll get all the help she needs .
trust me , little lady .
that woman had a seizure , and she was practically levitating .
and i have told you five million times i phoned herb .
he said that sarah is fine .
she just needed some fluids , just like mike said .
she was sparking , walter .
she was dancing .
then why wasn't there a doctor anywhere?
and why ...?
why ...?
walterl walterl and why did everyone just automatically listen to that mike person?
and why , why was everyone just standing there?
you mean why weren't they just listening to you?
that's not what i'm sayingl jesus christ , joannal
what?
you were fired , your kids barely know you , and our marriage is falling apart .
and your whole attitude makes people want to kill you .
it makes people try to kill you .
that's what we're doing here .
the people in this town have been nothing but friendly and welcoming and wonderful to you .
and you've been nothing but snide and suspicious .
and on top of that , at the picnic you humiliated me .
well , i can't do it anymore .
i can't keep fighting you for every inch of everything .
game over .
marriage over .
oh , nol
nol no what?
please don't go .
why not?
because you're right .
wait , i'm sorry .
i don't think i heard that .
what did you just say?
i said , you're right .
about?
about everything .
about me .
do you know why i signed on at the network?
because i thought that if i was around , i could help you lighten up .
you did?
yeah , i did .
what was that one show called?
i can do everybody?
see , that's what i mean .
i wanted to make you laugh .
that's so sweet , but i ...
i was busy .
i was running a network , walter .
you were so busy that we haven't made love in over a year .
i know .
i ...
well , i miss you .
but i've always loved you so much .
i ...
you know that .
why?
because ...
because ... ... you're goofy , and you're ...
you're handsome , and you're ...
you're ...
you're my walter .
and because when you play computer chess you do that little ...
you do that little victory dance .
i do not .
i don't do that .
yes , you do .
no , i don't .
but if i'm not the smartest and the best of the best and the most successful , then i don't know , who am i?
you wanna find out?
how?
first of all , we're in the country now , so no more black .
no more black?
are you insane?
you heard me .
only high powered , neurotic , castrating ,
manhattan career bitches wear black .
is that what you wanna be?
ever since i was a little girl .
do i really look ok?
can i be honest?
you look kind of like betty crocker .
i know .
at betty ford .
we need milk .
we need milk .
we need milk .
thank you .
look , i'm trying to make an effort to change .
i mean , last night my husband was a different person .
he was strong , he was forceful , he was commanding .
like your refrigerator .
well , nobody said it was gonna be easy being a homemaker and a stay at home mom .
it's the toughest job in the world , right?
well , that may be , but these stepford women ,
they're a whole other dimension .
oh , like yesterday , that poor lady , sarah sunderson .
walter said she's fine .
but you said she was shooting off sparks from her ears .
now , that's the first sign .
of what?
cheap jewelry .
we should go see her .
why?
because we need to be supportive .
that's how people behave outside of manhattan .
they care about each other .
i mean , if you were in new york and one of your neighbors got sick
what would you do?
we'd call her .
to see if she was gonna die .
so we could get the apartment .
let's go .
up .
up .
up .
sarah?
yoo hoo .
yoo hoo?
is she in there?
what are you doing?
it's open .
that's amazing .
so sweet .
and so trusting .
roger .
roger .
look at this place .
wow .
sarah?
sarah?
roger .
oh , herb .
oh , baby .
oh , yes .
oh , yes .
make me begl yeahl
oh , i'm so luckyl
oh , my god .
is that a dvd?
no , it's them .
oh , you're the kingl
yesl
i'm going up there .
why?
rogerl i want some .
roger .
roger .
baby , grab me some nachos .
yes , dear .
what's this?
roger , put it down .
what?
oh , come on .
roger .
why does it say sarah?
roger , you should put it down now .
let's get out of here .
this isn't our house .
oh , stop .
would you just quit?
we have to , roger .
for god's sake , we're trespassing .
we have to get out of here .
put it down .
come on .
ok , let's try and use this .
we have to go .
i'm so embarrassed .
i'm mortified .
i'm famished .
bobbie .
yeah?
are you making anthrax?
excuse me .
i've been busy .
my new book .
but can't you hire someone to clean?
someone brave?
dave says i got to do it myself , like sarah sunderson .
oh , could you believe her?
but , darling , her home is spotless .
and she's having incredible sex in the middle of the day with her husband .
well , i'm sorry , but my shrink says i need creative chaos .
my therapist says i need boundaries .
my doctor said i need enough electricity to jumpstart vegas .
you ever done zoloft?
kid stuff .
xanax .
i worship xanax .
i'm old fashioned .
i like prozac with a viagra chaser .
you're up , and you're up .
oh , roger .
viagra .
hey , is there something that you need to tell us?
well ...
sharing .
ok .
ok .
jerry and i have been in couple's counseling ... ... for over a year ... ... and finally ...
finally , i just couldn't take it anymore .
i howled , " you've become a gay republican .
and he said , " what's wrong with that?
i said , " what's wrong with that?
that's like wanting to be gay with a bad haircut .
exactly .
so the counselor suggested that we move to the 'burbs .
to find a balance .
we moved here as a last resort .
court order .
don't ask .
ok .
i know this is unthinkable , but what if we could actually learn how to be happy ... ... without paxil or compulsive overeating?
what if we actually gave this whole thing a try for real , the whole stepford thing?
hey , yeahl only one can survive .
zeus !
zeus !
zeus !
zeus !
zeus !
zeus !
zeus !
zeus !
zeus !
zeus !
zeus !

and ted owes walter 20 big onesl
ah , to be a man .
so , walt , you and stepford , it seems like a real match .
i'll say .
i mean , the town and the houses .
this place .
well , it's like a dream .
it's like ...
like the way life was meant to be .
and all of your wives .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
they're so ...
so ...
sweet?
sizzling?
super fine?
well ...
we are all so thrilled to be here at the stepford book club ,
i can't tell you .
now , i have just finished the third volume of robert caro's life of lyndon johnson , and i am dying for the next installment .
well ...
that's all marvelous , but today we are going to discuss ...
well , it is probably the most important book any of us will ever read .
yes , it is provocative , but it is also inspiring .
the heritage hills special edition golden deluxe treasury of christmas keepsakes and collectibles .
this book said to me ,
let's celebrate the birth of our lord jesus christ with yarn .
now , bobbie , we all realize you're probably feeling a bit uncomfortable with this week's book because you're ...
oh , what's the word i'm looking for?
new?
scared?
cranky?
jewish .
same thing .
but the heritage hill series is very inclusive .
in fact , there is a whole chapter about hanukkah .
i just love the chapter on pinecones .
they're not just for wreaths and centerpieces .
you can use pinecones to create a very special yuletide menorah .
your pinecone snowman could be jewish .
just add one of those little beanies .
or maybe i could just use hundreds of pinecones to spell out the words " big jew " in letters 15 feet tall in the snow in my front yard .
that's a wonderful idea .
oh , yes , yes .
that's very wonderful .
yes .
she's so smart .
i love the idea of creating a life sized santa claus ,
all out of pinecones .
ok , i love that .
i'm going to use a pinecone in my nativity as the baby jesus .
and i'm going to attach a pinecone to my vibrator and have a really merry christmas .
here comes santa claus here comes santa claus
right down santa claus lane
he's got a bag that's filled with toys for the boys and girls again
hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle what a beautiful sight
so jump in bed , cover up your head because santa claus comes tonight
who?
santa claus comes tonight
joanna , how is she fitting in?
well ...
ok ...
i'm among friends , right?
of course .
yeah .
so ...
joanna and i had this big talk , and we were really open with each other .
i mean , we really got it all out .
and i think from now on ... ... she's gonna be very , very different .
you think joanna's really going to change?
yes , i do .
absolutely .
and how long have you been married?
tedl yes .
don't you owe walter $20?
that's absolutely right , i do .
babel
yes , darling?
walt , sit down .
i need 20 .
you know my pln .
of course .
she gives singles .
are these all for day camp tomorrow?
i just want you to be proud of me , honey .
dad , watch this .
ball .
aren't robots cool?
oh , yeah .

snot butt .
funkmaster markowitz .
stone cold thriller killer kresbo .

hey , right on time .
jo , these are smoking .
why don't you make stuff like this?
why don't you?
because i have a penis .
we should get moving .
yeah , we got a meeting .
at the men's association .
when will you be home , honey?
when i'm home .
call a sitter .
bobbie , are you sure about this?
we're not spying .
we're just visiting .
fellas , i can't tell you how happy we are to welcome all of this new blood .
you said it , mike .
that's right .

it's very ralph lauren meets sherlock holmes .
it says , " i have taste and a scrotum .
roger , you promised .

sorry .
no , no , no .
jerry , you're gonna find that stepford is very open minded .
oh , yeah .

girlfriend .
miss ...
miss thing .
to stepfordl stepfordl
you bet .
yeah .
damn .
come on , let's go .
you think this is all right , sneaking around?
add it up .
all the women around here are perfect sex kitten bimbos .
all the men are drooling nerds .
doesn't that seem strange?
not to me .
why not?
i work in television .
oh , come on .
you know , walter , i think joanna is right .
i think stepford is the answer .
she's a great gal .
or she will be .
come on , help me up .
we shouldn't be here .
oh , come on .
don't be such a chicken .
i should be home with my cupcakes .
why?
because you only made 5, 000 of them?
we're trespassing .
only if we get caught .
damn , i can't see a thing .
oh , there's the light .
there it is .
no , bobbie .
this is like some alien freak show .
why?
they're just family portraits .
yeah , that's what i said .
the lights .
we should get out of here .
should we run?
oh , my god .
clarice?
hi , girlsl rogerl

jerry .

values i've discovered thanks to my partner , in life and in the lord , jerry harmon .
roger .
roger .
yes .
is there a question?
mrs. markowitz?
so you two are happy now?
more than ever .
because now i know that being gay doesn't mean a guy has to be effeminate or flamboyant or sensitive .
i'm no sissy .
no .
way to go , rogerl that's a manl
roger?
yes .
mrs. walter kresby .
roger , i don't understand .
you were out there , you were roger .
and now ...
now you're different .
your hair , your clothes .
you're like someone else .
people change .
you can't stop stepford .
you can't stop stepford .
you can't stop stepford .
you can't stop stepford .
you can't stop stepford .

so that's why we have to leave stepford?
i'm not following .
ok .
before , roger was witty and stylish and ironic .
and i'm sure he still is .
no .
now he's making speeches in a brooks brothers suit .
hey , there's lots of ways to be gay .
don't try to make him into a stereotype .
bobbie is right , and she's leaving too .
this place does something to people .
all of the women are always busy and perfect and smiling , and all of the men are always happy .
and that's a problem because ...?
because it's not normal , walter .
it's ...
it's not the world .
it's not us .
and i'm picking up our kids from camp right now , and we're getting out of here .
with or without you .
secure .
you'll never change , will you?
not really .
open the door .
unlock front .
and you're right .
about what?
if you're that unhappy , then we should move .
maybe head back to the city .
we could leave tomorrow .
thank you .
thank you .
what do you got there?
huh?

of course , but only for a minute .
then i have to get to work on this pigsty .
coffee?
no , no coffee .
bobbie , bobbie .
last night i went online , all right?
and i found out , all of the women here , they used to be big deals ,
i mean , big deals .
ceos , executives , judges .
sarah sunderson , she used to run an airline .
with that perfect skin .
no .
no , no , no .
she didn't used to look like that .
none of the women did .
they ...
coffee?
coffee?

bobbie .
bobbie .
this isn't you .
that's right , joanna .
this isn't me .
it's a whole new me .
i'm happy and i'm healthy because i understand
what's important in life .
yes .
your new book .
that's right .
that's what's important , my new cookbook .
and my husband and my family and making a perfect home .
it's a lesson every gal needs to learn .
especially you .
i'm your friend , joanna .
i'm going to help you .
you need me .
you stay away from me .
you're driven .
well , sometimes .
and you're selfish .
you wanna rule the world .
no .
i can fix you .
i can change you .
what ... have ... they ... done to you?
let's get busy .
answer the phone .
hello , is ...?
is this the day camp?
oh .
yes , this is ...
this is joanna eberhart .
i would like to speak to my children .
i'm coming to pick them up right now .
what?
walterl
walter , where are you?
i know you've got the kids .
pete , kimberlyl
oh , boys .
welcome .
where are my children?
they're perfectly safe .
where are my children?
you'll see them soon .
where's walter?
how could you do this?
ever since we met , you've beaten me at everything .
you're better educated .
you're stronger , you're faster .
you're a better dancer , a better tennis player .
you've always earned at least six figures more than i could ever dream of .
you're a better speaker , a better executive .
you're even better at sex .
don't deny it .
i wasn't going to .
well , don't i get anything?
you got me .
no , i got to hold your purse .
i got to tell the kids that you'd be late again .
i got to tell the press that you had no comment .
i got to work for you .
with me .
under you .
all of us .
we married wonder women .
supergirls .
amazon queens .
well , you know what that makes us?
smart , worthy , lucky .
we're the wuss .
the wind beneath your wings .
your support system .
we're the girl .
and we don't like it .
no , we don't .
yeah , that's right .
you're damn right .
yeah .
that's right .
and is this your answer , to kill us?
oh , no .
nothing like that .
we help you .
we perfect you .
by turning us into robots?
does any fraction of these women still exist?
of course .
almost everything .
shall we show her?
show me what?
it's a promotional thing i've been working on for when we go global .
walter , i don't think you've seen this .
some guys ask , how do we do it?
in layman's terms , it's really pretty simple .
come on along .
first , we take a gloomy , dissatisfied woman .
then , in a very private experience between husband and wife , he gently places her in our female improvement system .
it's fully automated .
and then , abracadabra .
her transformation begins .
first , we locate her brain .
we inse rt a few nanochips .
then we program them .
also , we add some secret , special ingredients .
to avoid any accidents , her husband is kept at a comfo rt able distance .
safety first .
finally , we enhance her , to fit the ideal stepford wife specifications .
and ... ... voil !
everything is copasetic .
welcome to the future .
it's a painting again .
i should explain .
you see , my real name isn't mike .
it's just a nickname from where i used to work .
where?
microsoft .
nasa .
disney .
aol .
is that why the women are so slow?
joanna .
is this what you really want?
women who behave like slaves , women who are obsessed with cleaning their kitchens and doing their hair , women who never challenge you in any way , women who exist only to wait on you hand and foot?
yeah .
that sounds good to me .
joanna , you're a brilliant woman .
surely you can appreciate , at the very least , the genius of the concept .
picture , if you could streamline your spouse , if you could overhaul every annoying habit , every physical flaw , every moment of whining and nagging and farting in bed .
imagine ... ... if you could enjoy the person you loved , but only at their very best .
and the only reason for your anger , your resentment , your rage is really very simple .
you're furious because we thought of it first .
while you were trying to become men , we decided to become gods .
let me ask you something , these machines , these stepford wives , can they say , " i love you "?
mike .
of course .
fifty eight languages .
but do they mean it?
enjoy .
walter .
walt .
joanna .
right here .
sarah .
claire .
marianne .
charmaine .
roger .
roberta .
oh , mikel
mike , mike , mike !
mike , mike , mike !

good evening , everyone .
what a delight to see all of our wonderful wives and their happy , happy husbands .
tonight is truly the highlight of our year because tonight we honor our very newest citizens of stepford .
in my opinion , they are the cream of the crop in couple that proudly proclaims stepford the american way of love .
now ... ... l'd like to ask my wonderful woman , my lovely wife , my bride , my best friend , to join me in a glorious midsummer night's waltz .
yeah .
is everything perfect?
everything .
mike .
yeah .

what did you do to us?
mikel mikel
men , control your wives .
control your wives .
it's not workingl
this is not stepford .
mike , what's happening?
i was in the garden , and i was dreaming of your ...
your smile and your after shave .
and i realized ... ... i can do better .
walt .
she's not a robot .
what?
what?
what , she's not a robot?
she never was .
wait a second .
i couldn't do it .
what?
why not?
because she's not a science project .
because i didn't marry something from radioshack .
that's a shame .
no .
that's a man .
i thought you were ready .
i thought ...
i thought you were ready .
i thought i knew you .
you're a disgrace .
to everything this town stands for .
to the future .
that's right , that's right .
tell him .
you're gonna have to pay for that .
don't you touch him .
nol
he's a stepford husband?
an angel .
now he's just ... ... spare parts , thanks to you .
but what are you?
are you a person or a machine?
i'm a lady .
a real lady?
every inch .
wait .
wait , a real , real lady?
are you a human being?
yes , and i may very well be the only decent human being left .
in stepford?
in the worldl
she's fabulous .
all of this , mike , the wives , stepford , this was all your idea?
yes .
all i wanted was a better world .
a world where men were men and women were cherished and lovely .
does anyone have a screwdriver?
she's nuts .
a world of romance and beauty , of tuxedos and chiffon , a perfect world .
but you were married to a robot .
the perfect man .
and all i wanted was to make you , all of you ... ... into perfect women .
we don't need to be perfect .
how could you do this to us?
because i was just like you .
overstressed , overbooked , under loved .
i was the world's foremost brain surgeon and genetic engineer .
i had top secret contracts with the pentagon , apple and mattel .
i was driven .
exhausted .
until late one night , i came home to find ... ... mike .
with patricia .
my brilliant ... ... blond ... ... 21 year old research assistant .
it was all so ... ... ugly .
then early the next morning , as i gazed across the breakfast table at their lifeless bodies , i thought ... ... " what have i done?
but more importantly ... ... what i could do to make the world more beautiful?
i had the skills .
but i needed help to realize my larger vision .
and so i made ... ... mike .
because he was someone other men would listen to .
and then i asked myself ,
where would people never notice a town full of robots?
connecticut .
so i decided to turn back the clock , to a time before overtime , before quality time , before women were turning themselves into robots .
back offl sorry .
why didn't you change the men too?
that's next .
you're insane .
i'm in love with a waltz and a town ... ... and a man .
so , joanna , you produced the hard hitting documentary ,
the secret of the suburbs .
and won ...
five emmys , was it?
oh , six .
she's shy .
and so humble .
and , bobbie , your ordeal has lead to a bestseller .
you know , i just can't hold a grudge .
so i've written my very first book of poetry .
and it's all about hope and communication and the healing power of love .
what is it called?
wait until he's asleep , then cut it off .
it's a page turner .
i cried .
now , roger , good news .
you ran and won .
you're in the state senate .
independent .
next stop , the white house .
yes , this country needs highlights .
that's our hero .
and , jo , walter really came through for you , so how's your marriage now?
is everything just perfect?
no way .
but we're doing just great .
because , um ...
because now , now we know for sure that it's not about perfection .
perfect .
perfect doesn't work .
what about all those other husbands?
are they still angry?
do they still want all these women to be robots?
of course .
men are pigs .
they're disgusting , they're frightened , repulsive little rodents .
but we're trying to help them , right , bobbie?
right .
yes , we're trying to reeducate them .
and where are they?
oh .
oh , they're still in stepford .
under house arrest .
hey , you guys .
which aisle is quilted paper towels?
if i don't get the right kind , my wife's gonna kill me .
oh , aisle three .
and i need ...
no talking , keep shopping .
