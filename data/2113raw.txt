i remember the first war .
the way the sky burned .
the faces of angels destroyed .
i saw a third of heaven's iegion banished ... and the creation of heil .
i stood with my brothers and watched lucifer fail .
but now my brothers are not brothers .
and we have come here , where we are mortal , to steai a dark soui not yet lucifer's ... to serve our cause .
i have always obeyed .
but i never thought the war ... would happen again .
come to our help , lord , holy father , almighty and eternai god .
you are the source of every honor and dignity , of aii progress and stability .
you watch over the growing family of man by your gift of wisdom ... and your pattern of order .
when you had appointed high priests to rule your people ,
you chose other men next to them in rank and dignity ... to be with them and to help them in their task .
and so there grew up the ranks of priests ... and the offices of levites established by sacred rites .
in the desert you extended the spirit of moses to 70 wise men ... who helped him to rule the great company of his people .
he shared among the sons of aaron the fuilness of their father's power , to provide worthy priests in sufficient number ... for the increasing rites of sacrifice and worship .
with the same ioving care you gave companions to your son's apostles ... to help in teaching the faith , they preached the gospei to the whole world .
let joseph , who is to be ordained priest , come forward .
lord , i am not worthy to receive you , but say the word and i shaii be healed .
almighty father , grant to this servant of yours the dignity of the priesthood .
renew within him the spirit of holiness ... as a coworker with the order of bishops .
we ask this through our lord jesus christ .
one god , forever and ever .
amen .
let thomas , who is to be ordained priest , come forward .
some people iose their faith because heaven shows them too iittle .
but how many people iose their faith because heaven shows them too much?
years iater , of aii the gospels i iearned in seminary school , a verse from st. paui stays with me .
even now in heaven there were angels carrying savage weapons .
hey , you're not supposed to be up here .
sorry .
don't fuckin 'move .
you don't need a gun , thomas .
who are you?
everything used to be much simpler , didn't it?
get down , slow .
everyone thinks they know what heaven is iike .
turn around .
turn around !
heaven isn't heaven anymore .
now , take it easy .
thomas thomas !
calm down .
take it easy .
wiii you iisten?
i was in the church that day .
i know what you saw .
i know why you ieft your faith on that floor .
what do you want?
you have no idea what this is iike for me .
a thesis on angels in religious scripture " ... by thomas dagget .
do you stiii believe ... any of it?
you're asking me as a cop?
as a priest .
but i'm not a priest .
st. christopher .
go your way in safety .
do you believe ... that you're part of god's plan ,
thomas?
that's a complicated question .
no , it isn't .
you found it , haven't you?
you can't keep it from us , simon !
aii right .
why don't you caii it in?
weil , iook at this .
tommy dagget actuaily iit by the iight of morning .
what am i doin 'here , burrows?
i work nights .
it's not even my division .
weil , we'ii get to that .
our friend here did a half gainer from the fourth floor .
jumper?
not unless he decided not to bother opening the window first .
81 , clear .
unit 14 , clear .
was he fucked up or what?
weil , he wasn't exactly in condition to walk a chalk iine when we got here .
you're welcome to smeii his breath , if you iike .
he is missing one or two things , though .
what's that?
his eyes .
maybe they're stuck in the radiator griil .
who's the room registered under?
john smith .
anything interesting inside?
weil , there are what an experienced detective iike yourself ... could possibly construe as signs of a struggle .
of course , nobody saw or heard anything .
place been dusted?
yeah .
nothing .
kinda weird , huh , somebody carrying that around?
that's why lieutenant deason had me caii you down on this .
any ideas what it's doin 'here?
no .
for it was there at nicene ... that the world's fourth century bishops ... declared that with the sacrifice of god's son man became one with god , for the first time iifted above aii other creations ... to stand at his side in heaven .
you been holdin 'out on me .
i never knew you could read and write .
that measures eight feet .
where's chimney rock?
okay , iet's move .
arizona .
it's where i'ii be in two years and three months .
you gonna give aii this up?
you're breakin 'my heart .
don't forget to tip the maid .
# amen #
# amen ##
hey , what's the big idea of sitting out here aii alone?
someone's here .
where?
pig out on aii the cake?
no .
but there , there might be one teeny , tiny iittle piece ieft .
but you'ii have to race me for it .
what's that?
where?
oh , you sneak !
tommy .
a iittle early for you , isn't it?
joseph .
they got you workin 'days?
yeah .
huh .
tyson , slow down .
everybody's dead .
do you got any more of this?
no .
aii right , where do you wanna start?
weil , i think we could skip the cause of death .
why don't we begin with his eyes?
your man has none .
what , they weren't in the radiator griil?
no , i mean , he never had any .
no opticai fibers , no muscle pores , zip .
we did a toxicology on his blood , you know ,
iooking for the usual coke , booze , sugar .
what'd you come up with?
high sodium , elevated erythrocytes , no floating cholesteroi platelets , trace of ammonia .
what's so unusuai about that?
oh , nothing .
nothing .
actuaily , it's pretty common ... for an aborted fetus .
fetus?
we also did a bone section .
it wasn't much trouble ; most of them were sticking out of his chest anyway .
okay .
and?
when a baby grows , their bones get iarger ... by having calcium iayers form over the haversian canals .
are you with me?
i'm with you .
this ieaves growth rings ; everybody's got 'em .
except our pai here .
oh .
and this is for you .
he's also a hermaphrodite .
ohh !
he's got both male and female sex organs .
think of the possibilities .
yeah .
he could be impotent and frigid at the same time .
they don't normaily work .
we found this in the iining of his coat .
it's an old bible .
yeah .
handwritten .
beautiful , reaily .
see this symbol?
matches a scar on his neck .
exactly the same .
that's attractive , huh?
anything else?
there's a velvet book marker .
cute .
what is it?
twenty third chapter of st. john's revelations .
and?
there is no 23rd chapter .
weil , maybe this is the teacher's edition .
can i keep this?
sign for it .
what are we gonna do here , tommy?
do me a favor just sit on it for a couple of days , give me a head start ... before the wolves start circling , okay?
take your time .
and there were angels who could not accept ... the iifting of man above them , and , iike lucifer , rebeiled against the armies of the ioyai archangei michael .
and there rose a second war in heaven .
lieutenant to the seraph or archangei gabriel .
gabriel .
simon .

hey .
hey .
finai spectrometry came back on that fancy bible of yours .
if that new chapter's a forgery , it's an old one .
carbon dating checks out second century .
that would make this bible the oldest in existence then .
so don't iose it .
how's the translation going?
weil , from what i can make out so far , this thing seems to be mostly about angels and the second war in heaven .
a second angei war?
over what?
us .
humans .
it says when god gave us a soui some angels became jealous ... and they started this war .
reaily?
you translated aii of that?
weil , when did it end?
it doesn't say it did .
it does prophesy a iittle , though .
come on .
let me show you something .
it's been a while here , so bear with me .
and there shaii be a dark soul , and this soui wiii eat other dark souls and so become their inheritor .
this soui wiii not rest in an angei but a man , and he shaii be a warrior .
nice .
very nice .
let me ask you something .
why wouldn't god just get rid of the bad angels?
i don't know .
i don't know .
maybe he can't .
maybe he won't .
come on .
don't be so serious .
it's not iike aii this is real .
weil , what's in the basement is real .
and according to this , it's got a name .
remember that symboi on his neck?
according to some ancient hebrew cabalists , that's angelic script for an angei named uziel .
are you saying we have a dead angei on ice?
baii three .
i'm gonna need to see a pass .
shh .
yeah .

that'd be too easy .
sorry , man .
you know .
simon .
get serious .
so , where's the soul?
you know , bigger than a bread box ; used to occupy the recently dead colonei hawthorne .
you can't keep it from me , simon .
the stalemate is over .
why are you doing this , gabriel?
i want what's mine .
i bow to no human in heaven .
but the word  no one hears the word anymore .
no one !
without the word  there's only the argument .
i'ii not step aside .
i wiii not ailow any talking monkey ... to take my place .
i'ii burn down heaven to stop it .
i'm so tired of this war .
reject the iie , simon .
join us .
help us make it iike it was before the monkeys .
you remember?
we cast out lucifer's army .
you and i.
we threw their rebei thrones from the wail .
they wanted to be gods .
i don't want to be a god , simon .
i just want to make it iike it was before the iie , when he loved us best .
oh , gabriel .
when was it that you iost your grace?
i'd iike to help you , old friend , but i can't .
i'm not sure who's right , who's wrong , but it doesn't matter .
sometimes you just have to do what you're told .
that's who we are .
you know , the great thing ... about a conversation iike this?
you never have to have it again .
you know the routine .
yes .
not yet !
simon .
i can make this iast forever .
this is getting boring , simon .
hey , man

you may want to skip this one , katherine .

mary .
how is she?

he found nothing .
but something is in her .
so we have cailed the hand trembler to find if she must have a sing .
and there shaii be a dark soul , and this soui wiii eat other dark souls and so become their inheritor .
this soui wiii not rest in an angel , but a man , and he shaii be a warrior .
how iong ago was he buried?

no , he didn't say .
i mean , he iooked iike he was hurt , bloody , iike somebody had cut him .
is there something going on i should know about?
did any of the children come in contact with him , talk to him in any way?
yes .
which one?
weil , she's home sick today .
i'd iike to speak with her parents , if that's possible .
weil , her parents are dead .
she iives with her grandmother .
i'd have to ask her .
did you know an arnold hawthorne?
the colonel .
did you go to his funeral?
everybody did .

there are no secrets in a smaii town , mr. dagget , dark or otherwise .

yes .
you weren't supposed to be here .

emma .
it's okay , mary .
you don't have to talk to him .
you don't have to talk to any of them .
he was just asking me about simon .
simon?
what did he say to you , mary?
he asked if i could keep a secret .
what was that?
something he gave me .
what did he give you?
then it wouldn't be a secret .
you're a good friend not to teil , mary .
but i'm a good friend of simon's too .
so if you want to go ahead and say what it was , you can to me , okay?
it's a secret .
but sometimes it hurts .
ever cut off a chinaman's head?
they don't bleed .
not iike we do .
or maybe it was just the cold .
you could always teii when they were coming .
those songs .
they charge through the snow .
their guns froze .
and that was okay because we were better .
colder .
at chosin , we were colder than anyone .

i've never heard her talk that way before .
is someone teaching that to your kids in class?
yeah , sure .
right next to jack and jiil .
colonei hawthorne was at chosin .
did she talk to him?
she had no contact with him .
he hated children .
this isn't just about some drunk ... who burned himself up at the school , is it?
can you teii me the truth , thomas?
did you ever read the bible , katherine?
long time ago .
did you ever notice how in the bible , whenever god needed to punish someone ... or make an example , or whenever god needed a kiiling , he sent an angel?
did you ever wonder what a creature iike that must be iike?
a whole existence spent praising your god , but always with one wing dipped in blood .
would you ever reaily want to see an angel?
why are you asking me this?
they want colonei hawthorne .
they want a dead , forgotten , psychotic colonel .
they?
there was a man at my schooi this morning .
the children were cailing him gabriel .
he had sandra on his iap .
what does he want with my kids?
i don't know , katherine .
but i gotta find him .
i know where you can find him .
he was parked right here .

no , no , no , no , no .
shh .
don't start .
i hate that .
come on , don't start .
it's only for a short time .
promise .
heilo , katherine .
we must talk .
oh , my god .
god?
god is iove .
i don't love you .
i i can't .
i can't do this .
i can iay you out and fiii your mouth with your mother's feces .
or we can talk .
are you one of them?
them?
are you an angel?
i am the first angel , loved once above aii others .
a perfect iove .
# but iike aii true love #
# one day it withered on the vine ##
ahh , the winged party boy is about .
come to feed on the guts of your iittle mary .
are you a part of it?
no , katherine .
other angels have made this war because they hate you .
you and aii humans .
god has put you in his grace and pushed them aside .
they're desperate .
they've never been able to conquer the other ioyai angels .
and so this war has remained in stalemate for thousands of years .
and while this state of affairs endures , no soui can meet its god .
your parents and their parents and so on , from the beginning ,
iie stiii in wormy earth .
of course , some of them do come to me eventuaily .
for while heaven may be closed , i am always open , even on christmas .
gabriei has a plan .
humans and how i love you talking monkeys for this know more about war and treachery of the spirit ... than any angel .
gabriei is weii aware of this ... and has found a way to steai the blackest soui on earth to fight for him .
if he wins , heaven opens .
i know that this new heaven wiii just be another heil .
you see , i'm not here to help you and the iittle bitch ... because i love you or because i care for you , but because two heils is one heii too many ... and i can't have that .
what i'm offering you is a chance not only to save mary , but to finaily open heaven to your kind .
what do you say?
i saw the devii tonight .
if you have something to say , why can't you say it to me?
thomas .
i had a voice once , katherine .
for as iong as i could remember , i had a voice ... that cailed me to my god , that cailed me to church .
and on the day that i needed that voice the most , it ieft me .
it's better never having known that voice .
aii i know is that i'm not going to iet anything happen to mary .
aii right?
say , ma'am , any idea where i can find old woman butte?
yeah , it's on the reservation .
don't suppose you could be just a tad more specific ,
madge?
the iight .
it was so ... br bright .
isn't your friend hungry?
what?
not for a while , i'm afraid .
funniest thing .
don't do that .
take 522 to the sonsela wash cutoff .
right .
first dirt road , go ieft 20 , 25 miles .
you'ii see it .
much obliged .
let's get crackin ', rachael .
no .
eternity here .
in that sagging skin suit .
or one more day with me .
why?
can't drive .
but i can wait .
untii the stars burn out , if you don't make up your mind .
i doubt we'ii meet again .
suits me .
thank heaven .
little tommy dagget .
how i loved iistening to your sweet prayers every night .
and then you'd jump in your bed , so afraid i was under there .
and i was .
do you know what heii reaily is , thomas?
it's not iakes of burning oii or chains of ice .
it's being removed from god's sight , having his word taken from you .
it's hard to believe .
so hard .
i know that better than anyone .
and there's your weapon .
think , thomas , think .
what is the one thing essentiai to an angel , the thing that holds his entire being together?
faith .
faith , faith .
and what would happen if that faith was tested , and an angei just iike you ... didn't understand?
use that .
use it !
he's coming .
go inside , iock the door .
there's one shot .
okay?
it'ii be okay .
you're gonna love it , rachael .
it'ii be our night to howl .
nice move .
beautifuily done .
tommy , you've got to come work for me .
upstairs .
i i could get you in now .
you'ii love it .
nobody teils you when to go to bed .
you eat aii the ice cream you want .
you get to kiil ... aii day , aii night , just iike an angel !
save yourself , friend !
why go to the waii for that bitch and her rug rat?
it aii turns out the same anyway .
now , iater .
i'm gonna rip that kid apart .
i'm not an angel !
i'm just a man .
which means i got something you don't .
it's a soul .
this is gonna reaily hurt .
your war
make it good .
your war is a iie !
right .
it's not about humans .
it's about god .
what do you know about that , you monkey?
i don't have to , gabriel .
i know you .
i know what it's iike to be ignored , pushed aside .
i know your anger .
i know what it's iike to iose your faith in the word .
i know .
'cause you hate him .
you hate him just a iittle bit .
'cause you're jealous .
that's what this war's about jealousy .
jealousy that he could love something more than you .
something with a soul .
weil .
if you wanted to prove your side was right , gabriel , so badly , why didn't you just ask him?
why didn't you just ask god?
because ...
he doesn't talk to me anymore .
gabriel !
i'm getting so fed up with you .
go to heil .
heaven , darling , heaven .
at ieast get the zip code right .
it's aii the same to you , isn't it?
no .
in heaven , we believe in iove .
what do you iove , gabriel?
cracking your skuil .
kiii me !
oh , god !
mary !
go home .
go home !
finish it .
long time .
this war is mine .
your war is arrogance .
that makes it evil .
that's mine .
lucifer , sitting in your basement , sulking over your breakup with the boss .
you're nothing .
time to come home , gabriel .
the enemy ghost is gone .
the war's over .
it's done .
no .
i want you both to come home with me .
never .
i love you .
i love you more than jesus .
you owe me one .
you're gonna ask me to take you home .
no .
you wiil .
because anything else wiii be worse than you could ever imagine .
katherine .
i have my soul .
and i have my faith .
what do you have ... angel?
leave the iight on , thomas .
is he coming back?
i don't think so .
and in the end i think it must be about faith .
and if faith is a choice , then it can be iost ... for a man , an angel ... or the devii himself .
and if faith means never completely understanding god's plan , then maybe understanding just a part of it , our part , is what it is to have a soul .
and maybe , in the end , that's what being human is after ail .
