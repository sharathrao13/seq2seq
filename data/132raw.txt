not bad .
but not good enough to live .
mind if i sit down?
i don't have your energy .
fight with your head .
not your heart .
straight .
better , einon .
but you're still dead .
purpose , not passion .
no one ever found victory in the dirt .
the peasants are revolting .
they've always been revoltin ', prince .
but now they're rebellin '.
king freyne wants his son to witness his noble victory .
there's nothing noble about crushing desperate men .
they're traitorous scum !
the king commands !
bring him !
you can come , too , nursemaid .
die , you dog !
i wish we were down there .
no , you don't .
yes , i do .
just to see you in action , bowen .
yours would be the finest blade on the field .
my blade was not made for your father's slaughter .
he is my father , bowen , and he is the king .
yes .
but when you are king , remember today ... and the difference between battle and butchery .
and remember the old code .
then you'll be a greater king than your father .
i promise , knight ...
i will be greater .
freyne !
now , hewe , now !
he's trapped !
einon !
einon !
einon , no !
enough !
enough !
the battle's out there !
father?
die !
it's mine !
einon !
einon !
i'm here , einon !
i'm here , my king .
dead , madam .
king freyne , your husband , slain .
in here !
in here , on the bed .
get out !
out !
out !
brok , out !
you stay , bowen .
forgive me , queen aislinn .
there's nothing to forgive .
his father's tyranny brought him to this end .
he's beyond all help .
not all .
a knight is sworn to valor .
sworn to valor .
his heart knows only virtue .
virtue .
his blade defends the helpless .
his might upholds the weak .
you must stay awake , my son !
you must stay awake .
repeat the code .
the code .
his might upholds the weak .
h his word speaks only truth .
his wrath
undoes the wicked .
brok , stay there .
lord !
great one !
your song is sad !
are the stars shining tonight?
no .
no bright souls glitter in this darkness .
leave us .
go .
aislinn , daughter of the celts .
whose people loved your kind and called you friend .
ah , the king's son ... cruel and full of trickery .
is this why you've come , dragonslayer's wife?
dragonslayer's widow !
this boy is not his father .
this knight here is his mentor .
he has taught him the old code .
i need your help .
the wound is deep .
you know what you ask .
i will teach him your ways .
he will grow in your grace .
he will grow just and good .
i swear .
no !
the boy must swear .
give me your sword , knight .
your sword !
do not be afraid .
he can save you .
now listen to me , boy .
swear that your father's blood lust and tyranny died with him .
swear that you will live and rule with mercy .
come to me and learn the once ways .
now swear !
i swear .
he's dead !
peace , knight of the old code .
witness the wonders of an ancient glory .
half my heart to make you whole .
its strength to purify your weakness .
live , and remember your oath .
i served the father only for the sake of the son .
all my hopes rest on him .
forgive a doubting fool .
call when you need of me .
ask what you will of me .
my sword , my service are yours .
only remind him always of his vow ...
knight of the old code .
brok .
your majesty?
the romans built this great fortress .
i will rebuild it , and mine will be greater .
it will take many men , my lord , to rebuild this ruin .
yes .
yes , it will .
not so rebellious now .
you should thank me , boy .
it was my stroke made you king .
no , brok , i want no martyrs .
death should be a release , not a punishment .
look good , dog .
i'm the last thing you'll ever see .
burn the insolence out of his eyes .
no !
no !
not my eyes !
no !
father !
run !
how dare you defy me !
einon , you're unwell .
you've been bewitched .
look at this !
it's madness !
remember the code !
the king is above the code !
have you forgotten everything i taught you?
no one is above the code ... especially the king .
dragon , i loved that boy , and you changed him !
you tricked me , dragon !
no matter where you fly ... no matter where you go , i will find you !
today i make a new vow !
i will spend the rest of my life hunting you down !
avalon , oh , avalon .
for you i quest each day ... the resting place of arthur ... and the old code of his way .
and when i find those holy stones ...
i'll pray , i'll pray , i'll pray .
oh , avalon , bright avalon ... think me not a fool .
my quest is not for vanity , my quest is spiritual .
spiritual !
merlin , spiritual !
whoa !
merlin !
merlin !
ow !
everyone's a critic !
dragon , dragon .
yes , i know .
where?
there , there .
get back here , horse .
you coward .
marvelous !
heroics befitting the days of arthur and the round table !
never have i seen such skill !
then you must have lived the sheltered life ... of a mon monk .
why , yes .
a scribe , scholar , historian and poet .
your servant , sir , brother gilbert of glockenspur .
my humble life is in debt to your exalted prowess ... your dauntless courage , and your superb , swift sword .
you have the poet's gift of exaggeration .
sir , you should read my histories .
but you belittle your talent .
modesty as well as valor .
the code of ancient camelot still lives .
hardly worthy of camelot .
still , it's one less dragon .
well done , knight !
congratulations .
our gratitude , mine and king einon's .
uh , you can keep your gratitude .
i'll take the gold .
yours or the king's .
gold , knight?
we made a bargain , remember?
one dragon put down , one bag of gold .
your honor has a price , sir knight?
it has expenses .
honor won't feed my belly nor shoe my horse .
the priest is right .
it is your duty to protect king einon's vassals as a knight of the realm .
not of this realm .
i bend no knee to einon .
i should have known .
foreign riffraff !
well , begone , vagabond , before i arrest you !
back to work , you scum !
if king einon's wheat isn't cut before the rain ...
i'll do a little cutting of my own !
sir knight !
sir knight , wait !
sir knight !
hear me out !
i'm on a pilgrimage .
might we travel together?
the road's still free , unless einon's taxed it .
a road tax , king einon .
hmm?
a road tax .
they are your roads , after all .
people really ought to pay for the privilege of using them .
and those that can't pay will have to work it off .
lngenious , felton .
only you could keep such a good brain under such a bad hat .
that's very good , " bad hat .
out of my way , peacock .
brok , some are good at hunting men , some are good at hunting money .
both have value for me .
kara?
kara , i told you
i told you not to come here anymore .
i'm a disobedient child .
go on .
take a drink .
go on .
magnificent shot , your highness !
care to double the wager?
ah , yes , happily .
shall we say the water bucket?
stand still .
stand still .
superb !
double again?
double again .
why not?
i say .
a moving target .
peasant scum .
you've got a nerve , interfering with the king's sport !
there's no sport in tormenting a sick , old man .
i beg your majesty , let him go .
it's been 12 years .
your castle is built .
he can do you no more harm .
for god's sake , release him .
father !
i've always said death is a release , not a punishment .
go .
kara .
yoo hoo !
yoo hoo !
i've decided to compose " the ballad of bowen " !
how do you prefer i should write this?
far away !
oh , don't concern yourself with my safety !
i mean verse , meter .
shall i spice it up with a poetical flourish ... or just the cold , hard facts?
if you do not be quiet ... you and i shall be the only things that are cold and hard around here .
i mean , it's all very well to go hacking and whacking at dragons .
but if a dragon falls in the forest and nobody gets to hear about it , does it make a thud?
brother gilbert .
what?
the quill is mightier than the s
ooh .
the quill is mightier than the
that's all that's left of the last dragonslayer ... who tangled with me !
if i were you , i'd quit while i was ahead .
is that the best you can do?
catch !
you know , i've got quite a collection of victims in here .
i won't be added to it !
i've given you my final warning .
into the mouth of death he strode .
into the gringy gloom .
into the pit of fear unknown ... perhaps to court his doom .
that was good .
what did i say?
what did i say?
a little damp for fire , isn't it?
why must you knight errands out to make a name for yourselves ... always pick on us dragons?
i don't need a name !
and i have a collection of my own !
yeah?
you're one who kills dragons for money .
it's honest enough work .
one must earn a living .
oh , yes , one must live .
well , since you seek a profit , we might as well begin .
oh , don't flatter yourself .
it's not the profit .
it's the pleasure .
perhaps less pleasurable and more costly than you think !
bowen !
bowen , take care !
he went that way !
take care , bowen !
you can't fly forever !
neither can you !
slow down !
come , visit the woods !
whoa !
look out !
well done !
ow !
pity .
that must have hurt .
yeah !
again?
ow !
and again?
how do you like the ride so far?
we're earning our money now , aren't we?
now , is there somewhere you would like me to drop you off?
yikes !
the sword against the fang and claw .
the flame against the shield .
blah , blah , blah , which one would win?
blah , blah , field , shield , wield .
whose flesh from bones be peeled .
oh , no .
whose fate would soon be sealed .
whose fate would soon be sealed?
whose fate would soon be sealed !
oh , you're good .
haven't had this sort of challenge in some time .
nor likely to again !
drat !
a little overconfident , aren't we?
hardly .
but if you win , you'll be out of work .
i will not stop until i've rid the world of every last one of you .
i am the last one !
you're just trying to save your scaly hide with tricks .
haven't you noticed the pickings are rather slim these days?
i got me one just the other day .
so it was you who killed the scarred one .
she and i were the last .
must've been a proud kill , warrior .
how much gold did her tattered carcass put in your purse?
that's none of your business .
couldn't have been very much .
and you'll kill me for sport?
and when there are no more dragons to slay ... how will you make a living , knight?
shut up !
whoa !
if your teeth come down , my sword goes up , right into your brain !
if your sword goes up , my teeth come down !
into the moonlit night the titans dueled ... in mortal combat bound .
oh , who'd the fatal false step make?
whose blood would stain the ground?
oh , good lord .
sir eglamore .
oh , thank you very much .
it's been stuck down there for months .
can you get your buttocks off my tongue?
why should you be comfortable?
my armor is rusting in your drool , and your breath is absolutely foul .
well , what do you expect ... with old knights rotting between my molars?
oh , god , my mouth is so dry .
no , no , no , stop !
no , stop !
sorry about that .
it seems we're in a bit of a stalemate , wouldn't you say?
yuck !
but i can go three days without sleep .
i can go three weeks .
ooh !
i'll stab you before i nod off .
and i'll chomp you .
marvelous , we'll kill each other .
what do you suggest?
a truce .
get out of my mouth and let's talk face to face .
how do i know i can trust you?
i give you my word .
the word of a dragon .
it's worthless .
stubborn lout !
i should have known !
go on .
kill me !
i don't want to kill you !
i never did !
and i don't want you to kill me !
how do we gain?
if you win , you lose a trade .
if i win , i wait around for the next sword slinger ... thirsting to carve a reputation out of my hide .
and i'm tired of lurking in holes ... and skulking in darkness .
i'm gonna let you up now .
and if you insist ... we can pursue this fracas to its final stupidity .
or you can listen to my alternative .
hmm?
what's the alternative?
father , father , look !
dragon !
out of the way !
out of the way !
out of the way !
pesky critters , dragons .
you !
like big rats .
you never seem to get rid of them .
unless you pay me two bags of gold , in advance .
come on , dragon .
come on , dragon .
yes !
ow !
hmm .
hello .
twenty eight , twenty nine .
most profitable , dragon .
i should have met you a long time ago .
there is much gold in the world .
perhaps when you've had your fill of it , you'll no longer need me .
i am a knight of the old code .
my word is my bond .
no compunctions then?
about what?
well , such deception hardly befits a knight of the old code .
fleecing einon's lackeys .
that's a service to mankind .
is it?
when you squeeze the nobility , it's the peasants who feel the pinch .
that's not my concern .
why should i stick my neck out for people afraid to risk their own?
don't clutter up a clever scheme with morality .
mmm , so be it ...
knight of the old code .
if i wanted my conscience pricked , i would have stayed with the priest !
huh !
and what does a dragon know of the old code , anyway?
his blade defends the helpless .
his might upholds the weak .
his word speaks only truth .
shut up !
i remember .
that's all it is , a memory .
nothing can bring it back .
you sound like one who tried .
and failed .
so i no longer try to change the world , dragon .
i just try to get by in it .
yes , it's better than death , i suppose .
oh , is it?
i should think you'd welcome death .
you know , the last of your kind , all your friends dead , hunted wherever you go .
do you delight in reminding me?
yes , knight , i do long for death .
but fear it .
why?
aside from your misery , what's to lose?
my soul .
finish him , brok !
well , are you a man?
should he continue , mother?
oh , the field belongs to the apparently inexhaustible sir brok , my son .
the quarry !
first you beg mercy for your father's fate .
then you try to avenge it .
now , you'll share it .
in your kingdom , einon , there are worse fates than death .
i'll think one up for you .
take her away .
no !
no !
he killed my father !
he killed my father !
he killed my father !
i remember you now .
i remember you .
your hair , like fire .
you gave me this scar .
didn't you?
i ... owe ... you .
i can , uh
i really can .
sorry , bowen .
i hope you like it well done .
you must have hated us very much .
i hated one of you .
these i killed because i wanted to kill him .
but i never found him .
i never will .
if you're the last , he must be dead .
oh , yes .
tell me , what was he like ... this , uh , dragon that you hated?
he only had half a heart .
but even that was enough to pollute an innocent boy .
einon was no innocent !
he polluted the heart !
how do you know that?
how do you know that , dragon?
all dragons know that story .
what was to be their hope became their doom .
a spoiled , ungrateful child was given a great gift and destroyed it !
no !
i knew einon .
i was his teacher .
i taught him the ways of honor , of right .
then he betrayed you ... just as he betrayed the dragon whose heart he broke .
that's a lie , dragon !
stop calling me " dragon " !
i have a name .
well , what is it?
you couldn't possibly pronounce it in your tongue .
try me .
it's
next time stab more flesh , less cloth .
i'll pierce your heart !
you already did .
a very special heart , like no other .
a black , withered thing without pity .
then teach me .
pity me .
i'll give you everything .
even power .
you're so beautiful .
even power .
even a throne .
oh , dear .
thank you .
it's passed now .
what was it?
an old complaint that acts up now and again .
forgive me if anything i said , if i upset you .
it wasn't you , not you .
don't be afraid .
i won't let you suffer the same fate as me .
i've come to help you .
this will bring you out well below the castle walls .
thank
you .
have you been watching over me all night?
i've been thinking .
yes?
about what?
many things .
mostly about what to call you .
i think i've found you a name .
you say that as though you reached up and plucked it from the sky .
i did .
up there .
do you see that group of stars?
i know those stars very well .
do you see the shape that they make?
mm hmm , a dragon .
yes .
they call it " draco .
it means " dragon " in the scholars 'speech .
so instead of calling me " dragon " in your tongue ... you'll call me " dragon " in some other tongue .
you're right .
it's silly .
no .
no , i would be honored to be named after those stars .
i i truly would .
thank you , bowen .
draco .
throw off the yoke of einon's oppression !
we must start to fight back !
your father sang that sour tune once , and we did fight back .
and once was enough !
we'll not dance to it again !
no , hewe , just cringe like a dog under einon's boot .
at least a cringing dog's a live one !
hey !
why waste good food on bad rhetoric?
i speak the truth .
truth?
it's rarely inspiring , lass .
and it never wins rebellions ... but it will stretch necks , if there is a neck ... underneath that little mud pie .
ready or not , here i come !
dragon !
it's draco !
about time .
mmm !
it seems you people are in need of a dragonslayer .
where is the lord responsible for this village?
brok lives in a big house about six miles away .
but he'll only blame any damage on us and pluck our pockets to pay for it .
i won't pluck them as deeply .
i'll make you a fair offer .
take it , or leave him !
it's enough you people grovel to einon .
will you be bullied by some broken down , blackmailing knight as well?
that's right , you don't need me .
settle it yourself .
of course , there are other ways .
perhaps you'll part with ... one of your precious daughters , instead of gold .
dragons are partial to maiden sacrifices , i hear .
