based on the true story
i always wanted to be in the movies
when i was iittle i thought for sure 1 day , i could be a big big star ...
or maybe just beautiful ...
beautifui and rich , iike the women on tv
yeah , i had a iot of dreams
and i guess you can caii me a reai romantic
because i truly believe that one day ... they'ii come true
so i dream about for hours
it was the year while i iearnt , i shared thing for people
they said i was dreaming
but back then , i believed that whole heartily
so whenever i was down , i was just escape into my mind
to my own iive , where i was someone else
they maybe happily think that aii these people ...
they didn't know that who i was gonna be
but 1 day they'ii aii see
i heard that marilyn monroe was discovered in a soda shop
and i thought for sure , it could be iike that
so i started going up reai young ...
but i always secretly iooking for who is gonna discover me?
was it this guy?
or maybe this one?
you never knew
they couldn't take me aii the way iike marilyn
they would somehow believe in me just enough
they would see me for what i could be , they think i was beautifui
like a diamond in a rough
they'ii take me away ...
to my new iife
and my new world
where we think wiii be different
