i got nothing , sir .
no sign of niobe or ghost .
nothing but blue pills .
should we try to contact them?
won't matter .
my gut says they're down .
we should start back .
lf that ship can fly , we need it .
i was afraid you'd say that .
search every pipe , every hole , every crack we know .
sweep as wide as possible , as fast as possible .
lines are crawling with calamari .
the sooner we find them the better .
thought you could use something to eat .
thank you .
any change?
no .
how is he?
he's gonna be fine .
at least until he wakes up .
what do you mean?
captain has some questions for him .
he'd better have some good answers .
you see these cuts?
i think they're self inflicted .
why?
vdts maybe .
i don't know .
but like i said , the answer better be good .
roland , i'd like to run another search through the matrix .
for what?
for neo .
how could he be in the matrix , sir?
he's not plugged in .
please , for me .
this is what keeps bothering me .
what?
his neural patterns don't read like someone who's in a coma .
the strange thing is , i see these patterns all the time .
where?
on someone jacked in .
the big bupkes .
nada</ i> .
he's not in there .
sir , i got the projections .
how long?
based on point of entry and the past speed , the machines will be in zion in 20 hours .
jesus h. christ .
all right , let's move with a purpose .
ak , i want you on holographics .
mauser , i want forward and aft guns manned at all times .
and make sure we are running on as few pads as possible .
hey !
you got a call .
what?
operator .
it's seraph .
i bring word from the oracle .
you must come at once .
good morning .
who are you?
my name is sati .
your name is neo .
my papa says you're not supposed to be here .
he says you must be lost .
are you lost , neo?
where am i?
this is the train station .
this isn't the matrix?
that's where the train goes .
that's where we're going , but you cannot go with us .
why not?
he won't let you .
who won't?
the trainman .
i don't like him .
but my papa says we have to do what the trainman says ... ... or else he will leave us here forever and ever .
morpheus , trinity , thank you for coming .
one thing i've learned in all my years ... ... is that nothing ever works out the way you want it to .
who are you?
i'm the oracle .
i wish there was an easy way to get through this , but there ain't .
i'm sorry this had to happen .
i'm sorry i couldn't be sitting here like you remember me ...
... but it wasn't meant to be .
what happened?
i made a choice , and that choice cost me more than i wanted it to .
what choice?
to help you , to guide neo .
now , since the real test for any choice is having to make the same choice again ... ... knowing full well what it might cost ... ... i guess i feel pretty good about that choice ... ... because here i am , at it again .
do you know what happened to neo?
yes .
he is trapped in a place between this world and the machine world .
the link is controlled by a program called the trainman .
he uses it to smuggle programs in and out of the matrix .
if he finds out where neo is before you get to him ... ... then i'm afraid our choices are going to become difficult .
why?
because of who the trainman works for .
the merovingian .
he has placed a bounty on your lives .
you must be careful at all times .
seraph knows how to find the trainman .
he'll go with you .
for years he has protected me .
i hope he can do the same for you .
please , follow me .
oracle ....
i know , morpheus .
i can see you're filled with doubt , clouded by uncertainty .
after everything that has happened , how can you expect me to believe you?
i don't .
for you to make up your own damn mind .
believe me or don't .
all i can do is tell you that your friend is in trouble , and he needs your help .
he needs all our help .
are you from the matrix?
yes .
no .
i mean , i was .
why did you leave?
i had to .
i had to leave my home too .
sati !
come here , darling .
leave the poor man in peace .
yes , papa .
i am sorry .
she is still very curious .
i know you .
yes , in the restaurant of the frenchman .
i am rama kandra .
this is my wife , kamala .
my daughter , sati .
we are most honored to meet you .
you are programs .
oh , yes .
i am the power plant systems manager for recycling operations .
my wife is an interactive software programmer .
she is highly creative .
what are you doing here?
you do not belong here .
kamala !
goodness , i apologize .
my wife can be very direct .
it's okay .
i don't have an answer .
i don't even know where " here " is .
this place is nowhere .
it is between your world and our world .
who's the trainman?
he works for the frenchman .
why did i know you would say that?
the frenchman does not forget , and he does not forgive .
you know him?
i know only what i need to know .
i know that if you want to take something from our world into your world ... ... that does not belong there , you must go to the frenchman .
is that what you're doing here?
rama , please .
i do not want to be cruel , kamala .
he may never see another face for the rest of his life .
i'm sorry .
you don't have to answer that question .
no , i don't mind .
the answer is simple .
i love my daughter very much .
i find her to be the most beautiful thing i have ever seen .
but where we are from , that is not enough .
every program that is created must have a purpose .
if it does not , it is deleted .
i went to the frenchman to save my daughter .
you do not understand .
i just have never
heard a program speak of love .
it is a human emotion .
no , it is a word .
what matters is the connection the word implies .
i see that you are in love .
can you tell me what you would give to hold on to that connection?
anything .
then perhaps the reason you are here is not so different than the reason i am here .
that's him .
get away !
get away from me !
we don't want trouble .
get the hell away from me !
we need your help .
i can't help you !
no one can help you !
oh , no !
damn it !
when is the train due?
it is already late .
it's not like the trainman to be late .
you think it has something to do with me?
i cannot say .
who knows such things?
only the oracle .
you know the oracle?
everyone knows the oracle .
i consulted with her before i met with the frenchman .
she promised to watch sati after we said goodbye .
goodbye?
you're not staying with her?
it is not possible .
our arrangement with the frenchman was for our daughter only .
my wife and i must return to our world .
why?
that is our karma .
you believe in karma?
karma is a word , like love .
what i am here to do .
i do not resent my karma .
i'm grateful for it .
grateful for my wonderful wife , for my beautiful daughter .
they are gifts , and so i do what i must do to honor them .
papa , the train !
yes .
find your bag .
quickly .
can i carry that for you?
all right .
hurry it up , i'm late !
who are you?
he is a friend .
i know you .
so that's what they wanted .
i need to get back .
i'll pay you whatever you want .
one way or another , i'm getting on this train .
oh , no , no , no .
you'll stay here until the merovingian says different .
if i know him ... ... you're gonna be here for a long , long time .
i don't want to hurt you .
you don't get it .
i built this place .
down here , i make the rules .
down here , i make the threats .
down here , i'm god .
get on the train or you'll stay here with him .
we should return to the oracle .
she will know what to do .
no .
we know what has to be done .
shit .
you gotta be kidding .
holy shit , it's wingless .
i get it .
you must be ready to die .
i need to speak with him .
only way you're getting through this door is over my big , dead ass .
so be it .
there are no weapons allowed in the club .
at the bottom of this elevator , there is a coat check girl ... ... and if we are lucky , one man for checking weapons .
and if we're unlucky?
there will be many men .
can i take your?
oh , my god .
what in the hell?
i don't believe this .
hey !
the prodigal child returns .
are you here for the bounty , seraph?
tell me , how many bullets are there in those guns?
i don't know , but i don't think you have enough .
we only want to talk .
oh , yes .
i'm sure you do .
you have fought through hel to do so .
yes?
i'll tell you what i will do .
put down the guns , and i will promise you a safe passage out of here .
all three of us?
oh , yes , yes .
of course .
who could have guessed we would see each other so soon after our last meeting?
the fates are too kind , eh?
and since you , my little judas , have brought them here ... ... i can only surmise that the fortuneteller has found herself another shell?
disappointing , but not unexpected .
i do hope , however , she has the good manners to learn her lesson ... ... and to remember that there is no action without consequence .
and if you take something from me , you will pay the price .
you know why we are here?
come now , what kind of question is this?
of course i know .
it is my business to know .
some might think this is a strange coincidence , but i do not .
i am curious , though , as to how it actually happened .
do you know?
no .
no?
i did not think so .
but it is always best to ask , huh?
we want to make a deal .
always straight to business , huh , morpheus?
okay .
i have something you want .
to make a deal ... ... you must have something i want , yes?
and it so happens there is something i want .
something i have wanted ever since i first came here .
it is said they cannot be taken ... ... they can only be given .
what?
the eyes of the oracle .
i told you before , there is no escaping the nature of the universe .
it is that nature that has again brought you to me .
where some see coincidence , i see consequence .
where others see chance ... ... i see cost .
bring me the eyes of the oracle ... ... and i will give you back your savior .
it seems a perfectly fair and reasonable deal to me .
yes?
no?
i don't have time for this shit .
you wanna make a deal?
how about this?
you give me neo , or we all die , right here , right now .
interesting deal .
you are really ready to die for this man?
believe it .
she'll do it .
if she has to , she'll kill every one of us .
she's in love .
it is remarkable how similar the pattern of love is to the pattern of insanity .
time's up .
what's it gonna be , merv?
okay .
you got yourself in here ... ... you can get yourself out .
are you ready for us?
almost , sir .
they got some pretty ancient hacks here .
but you found neo?
can't you see him?
no , sir .
we read something , but i couldn't tell what .
i can't leave yet .
i have to see her .
now?
it's my last chance .
that's it .
that's the secret .
you've got to use your hands .
why?
cookies need love like everything does .
neo !
i was hoping to have these done before you got here .
oh , well .
sati , honey , i think it's time for a tasting .
take the bowl to seraph and find out if they're ready .
okay .
i'm glad you got out .
me too .
so do you recognize me?
a part of you .
yeah , that's how it works .
some bits you lose , some bits you keep .
i don't yet recognize my face in the mirror ... ... but i still love candy .
no , thank you .
remember how you were when you first walked through my door?
jittery as a june bug .
and now , just look at you .
you sure did surprise me , neo , and you still do .
you gave me a few surprises too .
i hope i helped .
you helped me to get here , but my question is , why?
where is this going?
where does it end?
i don't know .
you don't know or you won't tell me?
i told you before ... ... no one can see beyond a choice they don't understand , and i mean no one .
what choice?
it doesn't matter .
it's my choice .
i have mine to make , same as you have yours .
does that include what things to tell me and what not to?
of course not .
why didn't you tell me about the architect?
about zion and the ones before me?
why didn't you tell me the truth?
because it wasn't time for you to know .
who decided it wasn't time?
you know who .
know thyself
i did .
then i think it's time for me to know a few more things .
so do i.
tell me how i separated my mind from my body without jacking in .
tell me how i stopped four sentinels by thinking it .
tell me just what the hell is happening to me .
the power of the one extends beyond this world .
it reaches from here all the way back to where it came from .
where?
the source .
that's what you felt when you touched those sentinels , but you weren't ready for it .
you should be dead , but apparently you weren't ready for that either .
the architect said that if i didn't return to the source , zion would be destroyed tonight .
please .
you and i may not be able to see beyond our own choices ... ... but that man can't see past any choice .
why not?
he doesn't understand them .
he can't .
to him , they are variables in an equation .
one at a time , each variable must be solved , then countered .
that's his purpose .
to balance the equation .
what's your purpose?
to unbalance it .
why?
what do you want?
i want the same thing you want , neo .
and i'm willing to go as far as you are to get it .
the end of the war .
is it going to end?
one way or another .
can zion be saved?
i'm sorry , i don't have the answer to that question , but ....
if there is an answer , there's only one place you're going to find it .
where?
you know where .
and if you can't find the answer ... ... then i'm afraid there may be no tomorrow for any of us .
what does that mean?
everything that has a beginning ... ... has an end .
i see the end coming .
i see the darkness spreading .
i see death .
and you are all that stands in his way .
smith .
very soon , he is going to have the power to destroy this world .
but i believe he won't stop there .
he can't .
he won't stop until there's nothing left at all .
what is he?
he is you .
your opposite , your negative .
the result of the equation trying to balance itself out .
and if i can't stop him?
one way or another , neo ... ... this war is going to end .
tonight , the future of both worlds will be in your hands ... ... or in his .
how are you feeling?
are you all right?
i need time .
that figures .
captain roland .
what's up , maggie?
bane is .
he's conscious .
good .
maybe he's got some answers .
i love that smell .
i sure am going to miss it .
oracle .
i know .
i know .
sati , honey .
take a few cookies and go with seraph .
can i come back?
i would like to come back .
i would like that too .
then i'll see you tomorrow .
i hope so , hon , i hope so .
i'm scared , seraph .
come .
he's following us .
well , well , it's been a long time .
i remember chasing you was like chasing a ghost .
i have beaten you before .
yes , true , but as you can see , things are a little different now .
and you must be the last exile .
the oracle told me about you .
really?
what did she say about me?
that you were a bad man .
oh , i'm not so bad , once you get to know me .
the great and powerful oracle , we meet at last .
i suppose you've been expecting me , right?
the all knowing oracle is never surprised .
how can she be?
she knows everything .
but if that's true , then why is she here if she knew i was coming?
why wouldn't she leave?
maybe you knew i would do that , maybe you didn't .
if you did , that means you baked those cookies and set that plate there ... ... deliberately , purposefully ... ... which means that you're sitting there also deliberately , purposefully .
what did you do with sati?
cookies need love like everything does .
you are a bastard .
you would know , mom .
do what you're here to do .
yes , ma'am .
i really wish i could help , but i just ....
i don't remember any of it .
what about the cuts on your arms?
those cuts are more than one day old .
yeah , definitely .
you're right about that , sir .
they look like they might be self inflicted .
but why would i do something like that to myself?
unless , of course , i wasn't myself .
but if i'm not me , then who am i?
has this man been tested for vdts?
yes , sir .
it was negative .
but he is showing a lot of unusual neural activity .
some cross synaptic firing , as well as signs of recent trauma ... ... with fresh fibrotic scarring throughout the cortex .
i want the truth .
i don't care what it takes .
make him remember .
sir , we found her .
the logos</ i>?
yes , sir .
about time we had some goddamn good news .
are the thermals picking up any signs of life?
no , sir .
nothing yet .
what about the ship?
holographic says the hull's still intact .
drop down and keep a man in the turret .
yes , sir .
get a full diagnostic on that ship as fast as humanly possible .
careful , sir .
the squids are sneaky bastards .
it could be a trap .
what was that?
you can put that shit away , boys .
all she needs is a jump .
niobe .
morpheus .
are you all right?
yes , i'm fine .
we didn't know what happened after ....
i'm sorry .
it's okay .
i'm happy to see you too .
did you get neo out?
yes .
how did you know about that?
the oracle .
you saw her?
just before the sentinels found us .
what did she tell you?
the same thing she always does .
exactly what i needed to hear .
in 12 hours , the machines will breach the dock walls .
every simulation we've run , we've seen that once the machines are inside the city ... ... the odds of our survival decrease dramatically .
thus , our primary objective must be ... ... to destroy or disable the diggers inside the dock .
if we can do that , perhaps we can prevent them from ever reaching the city .
if not , the only place we will be able to mount a defense ... ... will be at the entrance of the temple .
it is small and will force them into a bottleneck ... ... allowing us to concentrate the remainder of our defense .
we understand that you've requested additional volunteers .
that is correct .
precisely what size force are you planning to commit to the primary dock objective?
right now , the entire apu corps and half the infantry .
half the infantry?
lf it were up to me , councillor ... ... i'd take every man , woman and child , put a gun in their hand ... ... and march them into that dock .
perhaps it is best that it is not up to you .
time will tell , councillor .
commander , just one more question .
has there been word from the nebuchadnezzar</ i>?
none , and at this point there's no reason to expect there will be .
perhaps .
but we can hope .
i'm afraid hope is an indulgence i don't have time for .
zee , what are you doing?
making shells .
they're evacuating our level .
we have to go .
i'm not going with you .
what?
they've called for volunteers to hold the dock .
kids , you stay here .
i know how you feel , but you can't do this .
i have to .
why?
because i love him .
i love him the same as he loves me .
and if i were out there and he were here , i know what he'd do .
but you're gonna get yourself killed .
it's crazy , zee .
maybe it is .
but ask yourself , if it were dozer ... ... and you knew the only chance you had to see him was to hold the dock ... ... what would you do?
make shells .
what the shit is going on over here?
an accident , sir .
i didn't see
i'm sorry .
who the hell are you?
a unit volunteer , sir .
what's a pod born pencil neck like you doing volunteering for my corps?
i want to do my part , sir .
we gotta hold the dock .
how old are you , kid?
eighteen .
should have said 16 , i might have believed that .
okay , i'm 16 .
minimum age for the corps is 18 .
sixteen's too young .
the machines don't care how old i am .
they'll kill me just the same .
ain't that the goddamn truth .
give me a chance , sir .
i won't let you down .
you do , and you'll find me and the machines have got something in common .
okay , charge the igniter .
she lives again .
you want to reload the operations software , sparky?
yeah .
could you clean the windshield while you're at it?
uplinks in place .
i'm bringing her back online .
looking good , except ....
something's wrong with the matrix feed .
no , there's not .
you're looking at what we're looking at .
what's going on in there? </ i>
whatever it is , it can't be good .
the machines have taken junction 21 .
the way i see it , if we drop down from broadcast here ... ... intersect 153 , we might surprise them .
we'll go first , hammer as deep as we can , then blow our emp .
hopefully we can punch a hole big enough for you to get through .
it ain't pretty , but the way i see it , it's the only way back .
no , it's not .
there's another way .
a support line .
it drops down right here , 1000 meters short of 21 .
if we're lucky , we may be able to slip down without them ever knowing .
that's a mechanical line .
it's impossible .
no one can pilot a mechanical .
i can .
bullshit .
i've done it .
that was a long time ago , niobe .
i said i can do it .
so what?
you'll be the only one that can .
there's no way we can follow you .
hi .
i know time is always against us .
i'm sorry that i took so long .
but i wanted to be sure .
sure of what?
i know what i have to do .
what?
there's no easy way to say this , so i'll just say it .
i have to take one of the ships .
what?
to go where?
to the machine city .
i know it's difficult to understand .
no , it's not .
you're out of your goddamn mind .
i still have to go .
in 100 years , no ship has been within 100 kilometers of it .
you'll never make it .
i have to try .
is this what the oracle has told you?
no .
this is asinine .
if you want to kill yourself , do it ... ... but do it without wasting our ships .
you have to believe me .
i have to go .
bullshit !
i am the captain of this ship .
i say where it has to go !
and this ship will go to hell long before i let you take it anywhere .
he can take mine .
you can't do that .
don't try to tell me what i can or cannot do ... ... with my ship after that little speech .
but for chrissake , niobe  i'll pilot this ship , he can take mine .
if we leave inside the hour , we should reach zion as the machines do .
that's as good a plan as any .
it's a waste .
a goddamn waste .
two ships , two directions .
sounds like providence , doesn't it , morpheus?
you've never believed in the one .
i still don't .
then why are you doing this?
i believe in him .
thank you .
what's that for?
to help you relax .
to make it easier for you to remember .
what if i don't want to remember?
why would you want that?
what if i blew that emp?
what if i did destroy those ships ... ... and i am responsible for the deaths of all those men?
if i did that ... ... it wouldn't be very safe for me here , would it?
of course , it might not be very safe for you either .
i'm ready .
trinity ... ... there's something i have to say .
something you need to understand .
i know i'm supposed to go .
but beyond that ... ... i don't know .
i ....
i know .
you don't think you're coming back .
i knew it the moment you said you had to leave .
i could see it in your face .
just like you knew the moment you looked at me that i was coming with you .
i'm scared , trin .
so am i.
it took me 10 minutes to buckle up one boot .
but i'll tell you something .
six hours ago , i told the merovingian ... ... i was ready to give anything and everything for you .
do you know what's changed in the last six hours?
no .
nothing .
finished loading ammunition? </ i>
just about .
let's move it .
we are out of time .
you're not leaving them anything?
he said he didn't need it .
i ain't saying goodbye .
i'm saying good luck .
thank you .
i can only hope you know what you're doing .
me too .
it was an honor , sir .
no , the honor is still mine .
we're read , sir . </ i>
about damn time .
we're already late , captain , so let's hit it and hit it hard .
bye , baby .
take good care of them .
ready?
engine's still firing .
must be a fuse .
i'll check it out .
i should've known he'd send his bitch first .
bane .
no one ever got away from me as many times as you did .
every time , i thought it was the last .
every time , i was sure we had you , but you'd slip through our fingers .
i really can't express just how aggravating that can be .
what are you talking about?
i think i might enjoy killing you as much as killing him .
neo , it's bane .
he's psychotic !
you're gonna pay for that .
twenty seven kilometers to go .
we got an emergenc . </ i>
what is it , ak?
it's maggie , sir . </ i>
she's dead , murdered . </ i>
i think it was bane . </ i>
goddamn it .
i knew it .
i knew he was out of his goddamn mind .
he fired that emp .
goddamn it , i should have beaten it out of him .
we searched the whole ship , captain .
he ain't here .
i know where he is .
the logos</ i> .
we gotta go back .
too late .
what if they need our help?
it's too dangerous .
why?
because if he's killed them ... ... he'll control another emp .
at this point , they're on their own .
just like us .
mr. anderson .
i see you are as predictable in this world as you are in the other .
what?
he's out of his mind .
it might appear that way .
but mr. anderson and i know ... ... that appearances can be deceiving .
confused , mr. anderson?
it'll all become clear in a moment .
thank you for bringing me the gun .
you can set it down there .
don't do it .
shoot .
shoot now .
yes , shoot .
fry us .
burn us alive .
do it .
if you don't , he'll kill us both .
look at him .
he knows he should do it , but he won't .
he can't .
do it .
back away from the gun and turn around .
let her go .
somehow familiar , isn't it?
we've been here before , you and i , remember?
i do .
i think of nothing else .
who are you?
still don't recognize me?
i admit , it is difficult to even think encased in this rotting piece of meat .
the stink of it filling every breath , a suffocating cloud you can't escape .
disgusting .
look at how pathetically fragile it is .
nothing this weak is meant to survive .
what do you want?
i want what you want .
yes .
that's it , mr. anderson .
look past the flesh .
look through the soft gelatin of these dull cow eyes and see your enemy .
