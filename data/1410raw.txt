what doyou think you're running from?
i ain't running from nothing .

tuesday , thursday and saturday are maggie's .
now , on your day , you make an intimacy request . " rub my back " or ...
i have a problem with the kids .
could you help me out?
you sit around in your safe , little , fucking house ... with your safe , little , fucking station wagon ... and your safe , little friends .
you dream up the next hundred dollar head fuck .
" will you rub my back? " what a fazool .
you're an animal .
