'... 356 to london heathrow ,
'all remaining passengers please make your way ... '
harry , i'm not working , i'm going to my sister's wedding .
customer service will have to survive without me .
but kat , we've had three delays and two reps call in sick .
and a 2505 on the 8 : 20 cpt to lgw .
and there's this guy on line two who gut stuck with in laws because we couldn't get him out of heathrow .
i'd love to help you , sincerely , but i haven't seen my family in two years and my flight leaves in 15 minutes .
come on , kat .
please , i'm begging you .
bump the 14 : 14 to the upper on 16 : 10 .
what about line two?
check my bags .
i understand , you want your family to see you the way you see yourself , or would , if you didn't feel so victimized by them .
hello !
we regret that you were inconvenienced .
unfortunately , we are not liable .
but just this once i'll refund your ticket and credit you 10, 000 frequent flyer miles .
thank you for calling virgin atlantic .
your first trip?
my sister's getting married and the best man is my ex .
if i chicken out , i wanna know where the exits are .
i'm not a knuckler , i fly all the time .
the reason i can't feel my legs is that any second my date is gonna sit down in 3b and i need him to look really good today .
hello , 3b .
thank you .
hey .
kat .
let's sit .
i'm glad you found it ok .
the airport ...
the plane , i mean .
i'm sorry we couldn't leave sooner .
i know you wanted to get settled before the party .
work must be crazy .
oh , i should warn you .
you know those families where everyone's out of their mind but they're your family so you love them?
mine's not like that .
i love my dad .
but since he's my stepdad , he's technically not family .
he's more like a hostage .
'ladies and gentlemen ,
'we will shortly be arriving at london heathrow .
'on arrival , please remain seated
'until the seat belt sign has been switched off .
'local time is 4 : 22pm
'and the temperature is a warm 21 ... '
good morning .
'that's 72 degrees fahrenheit .
'we would like to thank you for flying with us today
'and look forward to seeing you again soon . '
oh .
nick , please tell me you're not wearing that tonight .
i am .
it's no big deal really , it just looks like a tailor made your tie out of my dress .
don't get me wrong matching's fine .
it's matchy matchy you wanna look out for .
we look like we're trying too hard .
exactly .
i want us to look like we fit but not like we're trying to look like we fit .
let me teach you a trick .
if you look people in the eye , they'll never notice what you're wearing .
there's no way i'm showing up in his and her outfits so if you're gonna wear that tie , i have to change my dress .
driver , will you please pull over somewhere?
i'm sorry .
i promise this is the last one .
you must think ...
who knows what you think?
i know how important this is for you .
but remember , you're a beautiful woman and you've got everything going for you .
don't patronize me .
i feel like crap but i wanna look hot doing it .
mission accomplished .
really?
don't get too attached .
i prefer the red one .
i'll let her know .
hmm ...
hmm , nice dress , " or " hmm ...
gorgeous .
i was insane to let you go "?
well , i'd shag you .
if that's all right with you?
i don't know if i can do this .
well , you can never be sure of anything but we still have to go inside .
aunt bea !
dear girl .
this should have been you getting married .
you know , you didn't have to return the gravy boat .
and to think jeffrey is the best man .
have you met nick?
how do you do?
oh .
charming .
and what do you do?
excuse us .
what a nightmare .
ok , we need a story .
you're a therapist , we just started dating and you're crazy about me .
count it .
6, 000 even .
oh , i trust you .
no .
count it .
all right .
i'll cover expenses but if you want to be intimate , we talk money first .
that won't be an issue .
i find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant .
i'm sorry .
no offense .
do me a favor , quit apologizing .
if you look at this as a business transaction , maybe you won't feel compelled to keep saying sorry .
i'm sorry .
it's also really annoying .
sorry .
sorry .
pussy kat !
what happened to you?
pull over for a quickie?
mom , this is so not the time to be yourself .
and who might this be?
hi .
i'm the new guy .
it's great to meet you .
lovely .
this is a marathon , not a sprint .
we've got welcome cocktails today then tomorrow's young people in the park and stags and hens .
friday's the picnic , then the rehearsal dinner and since you have left no margin for jetlag ,
i need you to hydrate .
dad .
my darling .
meet nick .
professor ellis .
how do you do?
kat?
kat !
oooh !
i'm getting married !
oh , kitty !
hey !
oh , i missed you so much .
gosh , who's the hunky , huh?
nice .
there you are !
get over here !
at times like these , i find a good , stiff drink helps .
can i get you a refill , sir?
very kind of you .
where did you find him?
thank you .
yellow pages .
hello !
sweet jesus .
who gave that woman an amp?
hello .
hello?
oh .
wonderful .
it's finally working .
does everybody have a drink?
because i am going to say a few words .
welcome , friends and family ...
i'm ...
victor and i are so happy that you're here to celebrate with us as we welcome edward and the fletcher wootens into our family .
we always thought that we would marry off kat first .
we had good reason to hope because she was so popular with the boys at school and we came pretty close once , but , as you all know , that crashed and burned .
luckily , we were able to get the deposit back ,
so here we are again ...
to the bride and groom .
oh .
yes .
yes .
well , back to the bride and groom to be .
um ...
edward , we are so glad that you fell in love with the girl next door .
our amy .
congratulations , babies .
congratulations .
jeffrey .
hello .
kat mandu .
wow , you look gorgeous .
gorgeous .
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
oh , my god , oh , my god , oh , my god , oh , my god !
top kat !
ooooh !
where the bloody hell have you been?
i have gynecologists that call more often .
you have more than one?
i play them off against each other .
hello , arsehole .
since you dumped my cousin brutally , you won't mind if i steal her away , will you?
thanks .
you didn't have to do that .
i wasn't saving you from him ,
i was saving you from yourself .
you , my love , are too bloody nice .
i've never seen so many beautiful women in one room .
did he bring a date?
darling , why waste time on that horse's arse when mr. tie me up , tie me down is waiting for you over there?
what does he do?
he's a therapist .
the perils of paranoia .
yes .
oh , god .
i think i've just come .
thank you .
can i have that?
hm .
thank you .
you know what i love about all this , kat?
there's finally a reason for the world to revolve around you?
exactly .
there you are .
how's the future missus?
i'm perfect , i'm all ginny .
thanks , snufflepop .
mmm !
mm mm mm !
wow !
am i not the luckiest bastard on earth?
aw !
well , i'll dance to that .
oh !
oh , jesus !
that's what he gets for not taking dance lessons until two days before the wedding .
who's ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding?
just about everyone .
you are taking the piss?
we'll go with you .
i don't even know you , hunky dunky , and i love you already .
dance lessons?
hm .
right .
hey .
oh .
hello .
weddings are a celebration of love and commitment ... in utopia .
in the real world they're an excuse to drink excessively and say things you shouldn't .
a philosopher , huh?
well , shrink .
crikey !
what?
no , nothing .
no , tell me .
well , you yanks and your therapy , it's a load of touchy feely mumbo jumbo .
spilling your guts to a total stranger , it's not natural .
oh , god .
it's just ...
there's this girl that i care for ...
well , i suppose you could say i love her .
the bugger is , she's here with some other guy .
there you are .
hey , kat .
hey , kat .
oh , hey , yourself .
i see you met my ex .
i was just telling him how we met .
mm .
the knicks game .
oh , yes .
yeah ...
oh .
you hate sport .
i hate cricket .
right , yes .
well , i should go and ... go .
he looks miserable .
what were you talking about?
he seems a little drunk but i think he's still crazy about you .
do i know you from somewhere?
no .
what did he say?
you don't ...
you don't think he wants me back?
when we are together )
# love started making sense
# i always make mistakes at my expense
# love has placed a seed
# and you're the sun that shines down upon me
# yeah , when we are together
# and when we are apart #
are you ok?
here we are .
thank god !
oh !
thanks , mom .
there you are , darling .
thanks , dad .
god !
thanks again for having me .
don't be silly .
it's wonderful to meet you .
although technically , i never knew you existed .
come on , bunny .
i love surprises .
where's nick sleeping?
my mother has this rule about sharing when there's no ring involved ...
don't be silly .
what?
i am not as small town as my daughter seems to think .
sorry about this .
i went through a painfully earnest floral phase .
air supply?
oh .
my parents had a german exchange student a few years back .
he must have left it here .
everyone knows their greatest hits .
some of their lesser known ballads are surprisingly poignant .
is that an old habit from ballet class or from a lifetime of walking on eggshells?
i never took ballet .
how'd you know that was me?
i have a friend at the magazine .
so much for anonymity .
go ahead , take a look .
it's part of the package .
i'm sorry , i'm just a little nervous .
i never thought anything like this could happen to me .
this happened to you?
it happened in the sense that i picked up the phone , tracked you down , flew you over her and gave you $6, 000 .
will you grab my shampoo , please?
shampoo !
got it .
# i'm all out love , i'm so lost without you
# i know you were right , believing for so long
# i'm all out of love , what am i without you?
# i can't be too late to say that i was so wrong #
the part where you were a sexual surrogate and then started to ... branch out , is ...
is that really how it happened?
the real story my mother was a hippie , and a stripper .
she was insanely inappropriate with me , she washed her lingerie in my bath water while i was still in it .
oh .
so as an adult , i needed to find ways to experience intimacy and sex
but with rules that couldn't be violated .
wow .
i'm just screwing with you .
you shit .
ok , this part .
you say , and i quote ,
every woman has the exact love life she wants .
that seems a broad generalization ...
oh !
oh .
do you honestly believe that i want to be single and miserable?
do you think that i want to be hung up on some guy who led me on for years and out of the blue shattered my heart?
first of all , there's no such thing as out of the blue .
and second of all , yeah .
what?
when you're ready to let go , to be un single and un miserable , you will .
till then ...
so when you were talking to jeffrey before , how did he sound?
like a harmless , self absorbed toolbox .
seriously .
he sounded tormented .
tormented?
how?
like he's ... jealous that i'm here with someone else , or like ... he regrets throwing away our life together?
it's just that ... this hasn't really turned out the way that i thought it would .
hey , nick .
oh oh oh !
he seems more mature .
run , you fat tart !
come on .
# shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop , shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop #
come on , throw it .
throw it !
# you'll look at me , and even though i know ... #
well played , darling .
ed !
what?
# one fine day ... #
are you ready , tj?
bugger off .
# you're gonna want me for your girl # shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop
# oh , yeah #
all right , batter , batter .
# the arms i long for will open wide # shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop
# and you'll be proud to have me # shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop
# right by your side # shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop
# one fine day
# you're gonna want me for your girl # shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop #
move back .
yeah .
# though i know you're the kind of boy ... # come on , kat . # who only wants to run around # batter up .
you're up , kat . # i'll be waiting ... # go , kat .
# someday , darling , you'll come to me
# when you want to settle down , oh ! #
be nice to me , jeffrey .
# one fine day , we'll meet once more # shoo be do be do be do be do wop wop #
out !
yes !
# one fine day ... #
lose the game .
# you're gonna want me for your girl #
no !
come on !
edward .
come on !
come on , you sexy little monkey .
come on !
you're supposed to be helping .
oh , trust me .
i am .
# one fine day , oh yeah # one fine day
# you're gonna want me for your girl # one fine day
# one fine day # oh yeah
# one fine day #
what's with the socks?
it's a golf themed bachelorette .
have you ever done a wedding before?
no , but i have done funerals .
an escort at a funeral?
someone's dead .
yeah , imagine facing that alone .
ah .
catch .
make sure he stays on the right side of the road .
which is , of course , the left .
that's right .
so , are you ever attracted to your clients?
i know you're curious about my business but i really can't discuss other clients .
come on !
how many of them want to sleep with you?
you know , i swear it's not about the sex .
it's about understanding what people need .
please !
you're like the yoda of escorts .
getting you on the phone was harder than getting into college .
no , i don't play games .
no gimmicks .
mm hm .
it's much more ...
subtle?
it's not about me .
it's about you .
show me .
come on .
hmm ...
what's holding me back?
i think it's the words " morally repugnant " .
show me .
close your eyes .
close your eyes .
close your eyes .
you're safe , you can relax .
i'm not gonna kiss you .
he's gonna be so sorry he lost you .
so , stop worrying .
forget the past .
forget the pain .
and remember ... what an incredible woman you are .
if you do that , he'll realize what he lost .
holy crap !
you're worth every penny .
you should get going .
mm hm .
ok , yoda .
boogie shoes )
to amy !
# girl , to be with you is my favorite thing #
i thought you might need this .
silly me .
where was my head?
bye .
listen , why don't you stay
and have a little fiery drink with us , eh?
uh ...
it's fine .
come on .
you know you want to !
oh , i can see why .
you're lovely .
isn't he lovely?
have you smelt him?
he smells lovely !
can you believe kat gets to shag this guy?
no , really , you should send god a bottle of wine or a quiche or something .
look at those buns .
fresh from the bakery .
it must feel great getting paid just for being you .
who says i'm being me?
excuse me .
amy , thank you for granting me a rare glimpse into a timeless female ritual .
here's to the husbands who've won you , the losers who've lost you and the lucky bastards who've yet to meet you .
and to the cock in the henhouse .
i can't believe you found him first .
i am so depressed .
will somebody buy my hoo hah a drink?
you remember when we took the girls hiking in the lake district?
no .
you do !
blistering heat in the morning , rained all afternoon .
no .
you backed your car over a copper's bicycle .
sorry , no .
the rat and gherkin .
splendid local scrumpy .
mm .
amy wore that little bikini thing .
but somehow it was kat that got stung by nettles .
kat never said a word until amy caught her scratching her arse .
then you rubbed it with a dock leaf to bring down the swelling .
yeah , i remember it .
i didn't deserve her back then .
and you do now?
what is his problem?
what?
there's something about him i don't like .
he's less than 90 per cent body fat and he's shagging your ex .
no , that is not it .
look at him , he's walking around all american , like he owns the place .
oh , no !
come on , this is your last chance .
woody?
not yet , but it's getting there !
it's getting there !
oh , my god !
what are you doing here?
i thought you were in san francisco , or was it nepal?
close .
sydney .
but it turns out that i missed the rain .
did kat tell you that she dumped you because of your funky breath?
she's drunk .
but i didn't ...
i didn't really dump you .
right?
hard .
but it was understandable , you were one of the hottest girls in school .
and we know that kat was one of the hottest expats in school because she was voted best eyes and brightest smile and the most likely to age well .
you're my half sister but i whole love you .
how about you get my half sister a seventh hole?
tequila .
tequila .
sure .
are you all right?
i don't know if i can do this .
the seventh hole?
no !
the wedding .
i shouldn't be allowed to get married .
i shouldn't .
what are you talking about?
tj !
come on !
come on !
what's wrong with jeffrey?
as if i would sleep with a stripper !
i'm about to get married .
you have to ...
it's been my experience that a man in love doesn't want a prostitute .
eddie , you did the right thing .
how do you know so much ... about so much?
i'm a hooker .
i like that .
i got the feeling )
# baby !
# sometimes i'm down
# i'm level , level with the ground
# whoa
# baby , you treat me
# bad ... #
# no , i know
# know you don't mean it now
# i just don't know when to say bye bye
# yeah
# uh
# uh , uh
# uh , uh , whoa !
# baby
# i've got that feeling , baby ... #
i just don't feel very well .
i'm gonna go .
give us a kiss .
ladies ...
how much do you rock , tj? ... that was a top night .
top night !
all out of love )
she's getting married !
# i'm all out of love
# i'm so lost without you
# i know you were right
# believing for so long
# i'm all out of love
# what am i without you?
# i can't be too late
# i know i was so wrong
# i'm all out of love
# what am i without you?
# i can't be too late
# to say that i was so wrong ... #
secret )
are you ok?
ooh !
ow !
# watch the sun rise
# say your goodbyes
# off we go
# some conversation
# no contemplation
# hit the road
# car overheats
# jump out of my seat
# on the side of the highway , baby
# i know i don't know you
# but i want you so bad
# everyone has a secret
# oh , can they keep it?
# oh , no , they can't #
morning .
morning .
ahoy , there !
hi , dad .
i don't know what works for you but i brought you some black coffee and some stale crackers , egg and cheese sandwich and a bloody mary .
that's very sweet of you .
but i need to ask you something .
what happened last night?
nothing .
thanks .
is this for last night?
no !
how could it be?
nothing happened .
if i was gonna charge you , i said i'd tell you first .
i didn't want you to think that i was expecting anything for free or that i was expecting anything at all .
i mean , obviously i was expecting something or else i wouldn't have stopped at that atm .
just so you know , you're 300 short .
wait , you're telling me that if something happened last night ,
i'd have to pay you $1, 700?
that's a down payment on a ford focus .
not dollars , pounds .
besides , it includes , you know ...
that's the extra 300 .
are you a boatsman , son?
i am now , sir .
i'm glad someone's making use of her at last .
the boat , i mean .
to defile . " four letters .
good morning , daddy .
ah .
what if i didn't want you to do that to me?
the 300's for you doing it to me .
if anything had happened , it would have been one of the highlights , for you .
but nothing did .
that's why you get to keep your money .
the wedding dance is the most important dance moment in a person's life .
a room full of friends and family , watching , smiling , betting on how long the marriage will last .
all you'll have is each other and whatever skills you acquire today .
and pair off .
sway )
# when marimba rhythms start to play ... # breathe .
good , that's a nice position .
now , your left foot .
her right foot .
good .
and we'll try to glide across the floor .
come a little bit closer together .
moving .
trying to turn .
what's the matter , nick?
two left feet?
oh !
# stay with me , sway with me
# other dancers may be on the floor
# dear , but my eyes will see only you
# only you have that magic technique
# when we sway i go weak
# i can hear the sound of violins
# long before it begins
# make me thrill as only you know how
# sway me smooth , sway me now
# like a flower bending in the breeze
# bend with me , sway with ease
# when we dance you have a way with me
# stay with me , sway with me
# like a flower bending in the breeze
# bend with me , sway with ease
# when we dance you have a way with me #
when i told you i'd never done a wedding before , it wasn't because i'd never been asked .
i'd just never said yes .
why'd you say yes to me?
there was something in your voice on the phone that day .
desperation?
i think it was hope .
get a move on , you lovebirds .
i'm getting married in the morning .
ah , hello , bambi .
darling , please don't do that .
oh , wow .
that's a big bed .
you know what pisses me off?
i've been spilling my guts all weekend and i don't know anything about you .
i'm allergic to fabric softener .
i'm majoring in comparative literature at brown .
i hate anchovies .
i think i'd miss you even if we'd never met .
come on !
i'm a little concerned ...
i'm just ...
it makes me nervous ... you know , i might just call you .
but if i did , i would lose , because my hand is complete shite .
ohhh .
i'm in .
come on .
there's gotta be something wrong with him .
i bet his thingy bends , doesn't it?
got a little kink in it .
oh , no , don't tell me .
it's bloody perfect .
i'm going to see you .
looky , looky here .
a full house .
oh ho ho !
has anyone seen my future wife?
she'll kill me if i don't serve her first .
have you guys ever had a real honest to god fight , ever?
yes , of course .
yeah , right .
well , apparently , makeup sex is the best kind .
not that i'm ever going to find out .
give me that !
come on !
no , no !
don't !
come on !
you seem to have a way with women .
why don't you go and rustle up the bride?
get her to join the party .
why are you bringing this up now?
i love ed .
what do you want from me?
i want you to tell me ...
blue shirt or ... white shirt for the , er , rehearsal dinner?
sorry to interrupt .
your dad sent me .
what for?
to make sure you're ok .
kat , could i have a word?
it'll only take a moment .
let me think .
you stole seven years of her life with your bullshit and your charm and now you'd like just a moment?
sure .
go right ahead .
thanks for the solidarity , mum , but next time a little less information .
do you believe a place has a memory?
even before ed and i started dating , we all used to come up here in the summer and spend weekends .
god , i hope it doesn't remember everything .
no matter how certain one is of one's position of what one should or shouldn't do , one sometimes discovers that one is not as one would have hoped one would have been .
what exactly are you trying to say?
i'm sorry .
look , i feel like i need to tell you something .
you're not even listening .
i'm sorry .
i'll be back in a minute .
hey , is everything ok?
yeah .
yeah .
anchovy , nick?
i remember the day i met kat .
it was in new york .
i'd been seeing bunny for a few months and she finally trusted me enough to meet her kid .
so i'm over at her place and in walks this little monster .
that was it .
i was a goner .
that was the day i became a dad .
you know , nick , you think it's going to get easier as they get older , that you're going to worry about them less .
or that you're going to trust the world more .
but that's just not how it happens .
this may not make much sense to you , sir , but i'd like to ask your permission to date your daughter .
i thought you already were .
i blame ...
i blame tony peepants .
no .
let's have the story .
kat , come on .
no .
i have to initiate nick into our family .
i blame tony for why my two girls just don't seem to be able to get along .
don't deny it .
you barely tolerate each other .
come on .
it's true .
the only thing you've got in common is you're both attracted to me .
it started after we moved here .
my two girls got into a fight over tony peepants and have never made up since .
apparently , kat and i were inseparable .
if kat ate a banana , amy threw it up .
if amy threw it up , kat ate it .
so we were eating and throwing up together in harmony until tony walked me home from school one day .
he was my first boyfriend .
tony ignored kat because he wanted to play with me .
anyway , the point of the story is that tony ended up with a chair in his face .
it was plastic and child sized .
as i recall , there were stitches involved .
come on , bunny , 15 stitches .
so is that when he peed in his pants?
he cried a lot , but there was no peeing .
so what's with the nickname?
i have absolutely no idea .
let me get some more wine .
would you marry me if i asked?
that was a yes .
did you see that?
and you know , i thought perhaps you ...
bollocks .
sorry .
i had no idea this would be so difficult .
i just feel like i owe you an explanation .
relax , relax .
it's fine .
i promise .
and i should probably admit that ...
i brought nick with me to torture you , slowly , for the entire weekend .
but then , i don't know , something happened and now ...
i hope this doesn't hurt your feelings but i'm just sick of you and me .
of our whole story , so come on , let's just go upstairs and eat some tiramisu .
i slept with your sister .
i'm sorry?
well , i shagged amy , two years ago .
that's why i broke it off with you .
and then after you left , sod it , we kept at it like rabbits , until we both realized it was absolutely mad and , obviously , morally wrong .
and then that was it .
but last christmas , when ed proposed ,
i realized ...
i'm in love with her .
good lord , say something , please .
oh , my god , he's told you , hasn't he?
you knew?
kat , i'm so sorry .
i'm so ...
kat .
kat , please .
kat , please don't say anything .
i can't believe you told her .
what's going on?
nothing .
it doesn't look like nothing .
now is not the time to catch on , ed .
ok .
good .
leave me alone .
you knew and you didn't tell me .
wait up .
i can't believe i trusted you .
come on .
you've got to stop running .
how could you not have told me?
what did you expect me to say?
you let me make a fool of myself .
you lied to me , but i guess i shouldn't be surprised because that's what you do .
that's who you are .
you're a liar .
you're judging me?
that's a good one .
you're going to point a finger at me , the guy that you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
you're right .
i was so desperate to make everyone believe that i was happy that i paid $6, 000 for a lie .
and , at the end of the day , the only one who ended up falling for it was me .
i wish i could say it was worth it .
go ahead , kat , hate me .
i think you're running out of steam on this whole jeffrey thing anyhow .
maybe now you'll be able to hold on to this long enough to ruin your next relationship .
nick .
i'm just checking into a hotel .
don't be ridiculous .
it's late .
take the car .
actually , the boathouse is empty .
look , i don't know what's going on with you two but i'm sure you'll work it out .
you couldn't be more perfect if she'd picked you out of a catalog .
thanks , ed .
hey .
hey .
i just ...
i wanted to say thank you for not outing me in front of ed .
i want to tell him , just not the night before our wedding .
you know , with these things , timing is everything .
you're right .
you should time it right , so that when he hears that you repeatedly screwed his best friend , he won't feel like the world is collapsing and there's no escape because you tricked him into marrying you .
kat ...
don't worry .
your wedding will be perfect .
tomorrow i'll say all the right things and you'll deal with ed when you're ready .
but right now , tonight , i'm not going to pretend it's ok .
home )
and that's your first flight out?
# another summer day has come and gone away #
all right , thanks . # in paris and rome
# i wanna go home
# mmm
# another aeroplane , another sunny place
# i'm lucky , i know
# but i wanna go home
# mm , i've got to go home
# and i feel just like i'm living ... #
i'm ok . # someone else's life
# it's like i just stepped outside ... #
i don't believe you .
i'm fine , really .
nothing a bottle of jack and a straight razor couldn't fix .
anyway , it doesn't matter .
it's amy's day .
get in the car , darling .
no , no .
smile .
hello .
i've been looking for you .
so , why did you let him go?
it's complicated , dad .
right .
it probably wouldn't have worked out anyway , huh?
i remember reading a fascinating article in the new york times magazine once , where this guy said ,
every woman has the exact love life she wants .
you know what?
i agree with him .
but i refuse to believe that this is what you want , kat .
ever since you were little , you've always worried about what other people think .
now , come on .
what do you think?
is he the guy for you?
then go and get him .
hello , darling .
your mother said you wanted to have a quick word .
no , no , no , i ...
there's something you should know before you marry me .
what is it?
i wanted to tell you but i was afraid you'd never forgive me and i just ...
i love you so much .
i'm sorry .
i knew you were seeing someone else when we finally got together , but not jeffrey .
does kat know?
jeffrey told her last night .
excuse me .
ed?
ed ...
calm down , ed .
ed !
tj !
ah !
ed , calm down !
it's all sorted !
she wants you !
i've given up !
what's the problem?
you back stabbing weasel !
that's not fair .
it was before you guys were even dating .
but you were engaged to her sister .
ed , calm down !
we can talk about this like civilized human beings .
i look like a total wanker , don't i?
yeah , kind of .
get in the car , ed .
he's halfway to france by now .
whoa !
i trust you've enjoyed your trip to england .
yeah , it was fantastic .
thanks , eddie .
you know , i felt sorry for you last night .
i was just sitting there like some smug arse , thinking , " aren't i a lucky sod?
i forgave her when i thought it was just some random bloke .
but not jeffrey .
i've had her up on a pedestal ever since ...
ever since i put her up there .
what a mess i've made , huh?
i'm so sorry .
the hardest thing's loving someone and then having the courage to let them love you back .
but if you know her shit and she knows yours and at the end of the day , you still would rather give up than try ...
nothing's ever gonna be worth it .
maybe think about it this way .
you go back , you get to spend the rest of your life having really great makeup sex .
ed?
must run !
hi .
hi .
last night , when we were fighting , i thought this was over .
and i was going to leave you alone and just take off but ...
then i realized i'd rather fight with you than make love with anyone else .
i should get going .
what?
no , you can't .
i have to .
i'm the best man .
save the last dance for me )
# you can dance every dance with the guy who gives you the eye
