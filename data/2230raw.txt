by late in the 21st century , the nations of the earth were finally at peace , working together to explore and colonize ... the distant reaches of space .
unfortunately , we weren't alone out there .
a race of nonhuman aliens called the dracs ... were claiming squatters 'rights ... to some of the richest star systems in the galaxy .
well , they weren't going to get it without a fight .
space was the new battleground .
for many of us , earth became a precious memory light years away .
our only home was a fortress in space .
as in any war , there were long periods with nothing to do but wait .
and then ...
all personnel to battle stations .
prepare to launch .
this is not an exercise .

joey?
hey , joey !
i'm sorry , joey .
i'm sorry .
i could see where the drac fighter went down .
its ejection capsule couldn't be far from the wreck .
i just hoped it wasn't dead ... yet .
it's funny , but i'd never actually seen a drac .
i knew they were completely inhuman , not even male or female , but both , bundled together in a scaly reptilian body .
yah !
yah !
burn , you mother !
burn !
ha !
burn , sucker !
you blew it , toadface !
earthman .

yeah , poogah .
write and tell my mother , you big frog .
look .
we have to build a shelter with stones .
shelter .

it was slow going .
since i had to communicate with that lizard ,
i tried learning a few words of its crude lingo .
hey , drac .
drac , uh ...
forget it .
enough talk .
let's get on with it , huh?
shit !
of course , the drac was picking up a few words of english , too .
yeah !
shit !
shit?
what do you mean , shit?
no solid .
it's solid .
i'll show you .
huh?
ha ha !
not solid .
left foot .
right foot .
this is my left foot .
this is my right foot .
and this am both my feet .
yeah , great .
yeah , great .
this is my head .
that is your ugly head .
no , no .
this is my head .
that is you head .
you ugly head .
ha ha .
that is davidge's ugly head .
all right , that's enough !
you keep that up and you can learn english all by yourself ... because i'm not gonna be your teacher anymore .
sorry , davidge .
that's better .
you know , while you're having such a good time and doing nothing ,
i am trying to think of ways to improve our situation .
okay .
you know the old saying , if at first you don't succeed , try , try again .
davidge , you learn this from great drac teacher , shismar?
no , from mickey mouse .
who?
mickey mous s s se .
mickey mouse .
is this great earthman teacher?
yeah .
sort of .
# shine its ever lovin 'light on me #
# let the midnight special #
# shine its light on me #
# let the midnight special ##
forget it .
mmm !
delish .
have one .
don't forget you helped me acquire the taste .
besides , i'm going to improve the menu .
soon we picked up ... one side or other side .
what , with the war going on?
we got more chance of catching a greyhound bus .
humans , easy you give up .
shismar teaches us ... intelligent life takes a stand .
where did you get that crap?
out of that little book you're always reading?
i'm the one that's taking a stand .
remember , i wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for you sons of shitmat .
shismar !
yeah , whatever .
this war begun by you , by humans !
you know something , jerry?
your great shismar ain't shit .
earthman , your mickey mouse is one big stupid dope !
yea !
meat !
stay there , you mother !
hey !
hey !
hey !
aha !
you dirty rotten son of a bitch !
shit .
hey .
hey , god dang it !
hey .
get out of here !
no !
jerry !
jerry !
jerry !
jerry !
jerry !
jerry !
jerry !
aah !
aah !

aah !
jerry !
oh !
oh , god !
oh , god !
jerry !
help !
get it !
thank you .
thank you .
go ahead .
aah !
aah , god !
you saved my life .
why?
maybe ...
i need to look at another face ... even as ugly as yours .
so you still think humans are ugly , huh?
compared to a drac , very ugly .
but that thing out there ... was even more ugly than you .
thank you .
you are welcome .
ha !
that's it !
even that thing under the ground couldn't bite through this .
i bet these shells are meteorproof .
they're meteorproof !
what?
zerkiproof !
zerkiproof !
jerry , old drac , [ laughs ]
where would you be without me , huh?
back home .
ah , shit !
hey , professor , how about a little help , huh?
don't you ever get tired of reading that book?
no .
well , what's in it , anyway?
things .
oh , for christ's sake !
it is called talmon .
it contains the words of our great teacher , shismar .
i suppose you have to know the drac language to read it , right?
it would help .
so teach me the drac language .
it is not for you , davidge .
shismar is too good for us humans , is that it?
not too good for humans , but too good for you .
now you're a judge of character .
do you not remember what you say about shismar?
well , maybe you forgot what you said about mickey mouse !
that was wrong .
i did not mean it .
i didn't mean what i said about shismar , either .
jerry , what , what are you ...
this book must be given to the pupil .
i then become the master .
i am not worthy , but there is no one else here .
time passed , as time does .
we ate , we slept .
and sometimes i listened to the skies ... for some faint hope of rescue .
in the meantime ,
i studied its language and read its talmon .
translate .
if one receives evil from another ,
let one not do evil in return .
rather , let him extend love ...
to the enemy , that love might unite them .
i've heard all this before ... in the human talmon .
of course you have .
truth is truth .
but what you have not yet learned ... is the way we dracs express the truth .
the words of shismar must be sung .

jerry !
let's go !
come on , jerry , move it !
run !
get up !
get up , damn you !
what do i have to do , carry you?
i am sorry .
we live like cannibals .
you get so fat , you can barely move .
you'll never conquer the universe in that state .
conquer the universe?
we were here 1, 000 years before you !
well , in case you haven't heard , drac face , we legally annexed this star system .
you invaded this star system !
bullshit !
you're the invaders .
no .
we are explorers .
we are founders of worlds !
what do you think we are , drac face , homebodies?
we've settled twice as many worlds than you .
exactly .
you spread like a disease .
then what the hell are you going to do about it , huh?
you'll see what we do about it , earthman .
we fight .
some fighter you are .
you wouldn't last a week without me .
you owe your miserable existence to me .
we'll see about that !
get out of my shelter !
get out !
get out !
get out of my shelter !
you son of a bitch !
it's my shelter !
i built it !
you son of a bitch !
i'll kill you , you bastard !
i'll kill you !
i'll kill you !
jerry ...
i think we're starting to go crazy .
what we have to do , we have to start moving .
do you think we really are alone out here?
of course we are alone .
i don't know .
i had that dream again .
there's this big ship in my dream .
it's so loud , i wake up .
and then i can still hear it .
it was a dream .
i don't know .
maybe .
but i do know if we stay here , we die .
sooner or later , we'll die .
if this planet don't kill us , we're gonna kill each other .
you sure you won't come with me , huh?
davidge , i stay here .
i have no interest in your dreams .
any chance is better than no chance .
come on , jerry .
you're just being stubborn .
no , i am not just being ... stubborn .
if i find help ...
i'll come back for you .
and if you do not?
then i guess we both die .
alone .
i'll see you later .
hello !
anybody !
core samples .
they're core samples .
scavengers .
what i'd been hearing at night was the scavenger ship .
the scavengers were human ... barely human .
they were outlaw miners who raped whole planets for precious ores .
they hunted dracs for slave labor so we tolerated them .
i could only hope they'd found nothing .
i had no idea what i was going to say to jerry .
davidge ... how cold do you think it's going to get?
i don't know .
i guess we'll find out .
i am happy you came back .
jerry?
hey , jerry , what's wrong?
i could not go with you .
it is no longer my life that matters .
i am not fat .
i am not lazy .
davidge .
i await a new ...
life .
a new life?
from where?
oh , my god .
oh , my god?
are you telling me you're pregnant?
you're going to have a baby?
a little drac?
but how?
well , don't look at me !
jerry , you can't do this to me .
with you humans , birth is a matter of choice .
with us dracs , it happens .
when the time comes , it just happens .
that is why i could not go with you .
my child is all ...
i have now .
davidge , tell me .
what ... did you find ... out there?
nothing .
like you said , it was just a dream .

... jerry?
zammis .
hmm?
zammis?
zammis .
soon .
jerry !
jerry !
jerry !
jerry , look out !
i can't see !
i can't see !
over here !
help me !
come on , jerry .
don't you quit on me .
tell me about zammis .
zammis?
what kind of name is zammis?
there are five names in a drac's lineage .
i am sheegan .
before me was gathic .
and before gathic was islane .
come on , keep talking .
before islane was tighe .
before tighe was zammis .
up there .
look !
one day i must stand with zammis ... before the holy council on dracon ... and recite our lineage ... so that zammis may join ... the society of all dracs .
you wanna eat?
i can't .
maybe we should open up a little place here .
i could ruin the food .
you could frighten the customers .
davidge .
i will teach you the farebeat line .
before or after breakfast?
it is an honor i offer you .
i'm sorry .
right now just staying alive is honor enough , huh?
all right .
i will learn your lineage .
let us begin with your parents .
who were they?
my dad's name's carl .
my mom's name's , uh ...
dolores .
their deeds?
well , dad works for a company that makes computers .
and my mom , she used to be a waitress .
waitress .
yeah , before they got married .
and their parents?
we used to visit my grandpa when i was just a kid .
he had this place out in the country .
i think he was a farmer .
and , uh ...
grandma was just a good cook .
oh .
that is your lineage .
here stands before you ...
willis e. davidge .
fighter pilot .
son of dolores , who used to be a waitress .
and carl , maker of computers , who in their time were born of grandpa , possibly a farmer .
and grandma , good cook .
you make it sound pretty thin .
it is thin .
but i am honored ... that you entrusted it to me .
my own lineage is very rich , davidge .
learn it from me .
allow me to do you this honor .
it will be a good gift between us .

jerry went on singing its lineage , back to the founding of its home planet ... 1 70 generations ago .
to keep jerry happy as the winter raged on ,
i , too , learned to sing the farebeat line .
what's wrong?
zammis ... is coming .
oh , god .
god .
what do i do?
i don't know .
something ... is wrong !
oh , no .
no , no , no !
you're gonna be all right .
the women always get nervous before labor .
i am not a woman .
oh , but pregnant people ...
things get nervous .
everybody gets nervous before labor .
besides , i mean , if anything happened to you ,
i'd be left here all alone .
huh?
just because business has been a little slow lately , you expect me to run the whole place alone?
you are alone .
within yourself , you are alone .
that is why you humans ... have separated your sexes ... into two separate halves , for the joy of that brief ... union .
you don't know diddly poop about humans .
do you think just because you dracs got a lineage 200 miles long , you can blah , blah this name and blah , blah that name?
jerry !
jerry !
jerry?
jerry?
davidge .
listen to me .
you ... must be a parent ... for zammis .
don't kid around , jerry .
what do we do now?
you ... must take my place .
when the time comes ... you must find a way ... to take zammis ... back home ... you must stand beside zammis ... before the holy council ... of dracon ... and recite ... its lineage .
you must , davidge .
swear this to me .
shut up .
keep pushing .
do whatever you do .
you must ... take zammis to dracon .
swear .
no !
swear .
swear .
all right .
all right , i swear it .
i swear it .
just don't die on me .
now ... you must open me .
here .
this place .
don't be afraid , my friend .
i can't !
then you ... must ... want ... to ... have this war .
you ... have ... s s ...
no .
jerry .
oh , please .
gosh , jerry , what am i supposed to do now , huh?
you taught me all about the talmon , the line of jareeba , but you didn't say nothing about taking care of baby dracs .
so long , jerry !
oh , all right .
ok , we're going to try it again , huh?
come on , doll .
come on .
eat .
come on .
zammis .
zammis , come on .
come on .
what am i supposed to do , run down to the market for gerber baby drac food?
this is all there is , pal .
watch .
watch me .
watch .
hmm?
hmm?
mmm !
come on .
okay .
come here .
like this .
come on .
see if you like that .
do you like that?
huh?
huh?
come on , kid .
yes , that's it !
that's it .
chew it now .
there you go .
hey , squirt !
let's fly , huh?
i guess he was an ugly little cuss , but no uglier than the pictures of those other kids ... that used to be shown around the mess hall .
of course , he grew slightly faster than a human child .
i'm going to start calling you beanstalk .
you outgrow your clothes faster than i can even catch them .
don't spread your fingers .
fingers?
yeah , these .
fingers .
cattuh .
fingers .
they're not the same .
well , of course they're not the same .
you're a drac , i'm a human .
look , look , uh ... now , you have three fingers .
one , two , three .
now , i have five fingers .
one , two , three , four , five .
zammis get four five?
no .
you're a drac , and i'm a human .
human?
yeah , um ... human is me .
drac is you .
now , i'm a human because my parents were human , and your parent was a drac , so you are a drac .
got it?
i'm a drac !
yeah !
yeah , great .
uncle !
uncle , wait !
wait !
huh?
uncle .
what was that?
spacecraft .
were there humans inside?
i don't know !
i'm going to go find out !
uncle , please , can i come?
no !
stay here until i get back .
uncle , why are you afraid?
uncle , please !
no !
you stay inside the cave !
so , that's why when we walk or we hunt , we always go in the direction of the rising of the sun .
never in the direction of the setting of the sun .
is that clear?
yes .
because if those men ever find us ...
we'll never see each other again .
but , uncle , they're humans ,
like you .
shut up and eat .
i tried not to think about the scavengers .
instead , i concentrated on zammis .
i finally figured it was time to start his education .
the name of this game , zammis ...
is football .
football .
now , these trees are my defensive line .
those trees over there are your team .
they're a bigger than real players , like the houston oilers , and a little bit slower , but not much , all right?
you go down to that end of the field .
that's your end zone .
okay?
go on .
hey o !
all right , now , when i kick the ball to you , you catch it and you try to run past me , if you can , through these two guys there .
that's your goal line .
you got it?
no .
just do what i tell you .
it'll be fine .
all right?
all right?
here comes the kickoff .
pick it up !
pick it up !
now run !
now run .
run !
come on !
go !
zammis has got the ball !
look at him weaving through that defense !
davidge has got the ball !
oh !
at the 20 yard line .
i like this game .
it's a great game .
you don't normally get to eat the ball .
that's a bonus .
i've simplified the rules for the conditions here .
small teams and so on .
i've been thinking , uncle , about those humans you saw .
maybe they are friends with the dracs .
maybe they asked them to come and work .
i wish that was true .
i have never seen a drac , only my own face in the water .
i wish i was not a drac .
i wish i had your face .
oh , zammis .
i wish i had five fingers .
oh , zammis .
listen to me .
as dracs go , you are a great looking kid .
yeah?
yeah .
it's just that ... you've never seen your own kind .
now , someday , you're going to go home , and you're gonna forget all about this god awful planet ... and all about me .
i will never forget you , uncle .
no , i guess you won't .
i won't forget you either .
uncle?
what was my parent like?
zammis ... your parent ... was my friend .
hey , zammis .
hey , zammis .
hey , zammis !
oh , no .
hey , zammis !
all right , move it now .
zammis !
zammis !
hey , johnny , look here .
a fine little woggie , if i ever saw one .
surprise , surprise .
looks a bit stringy to me , though .
no , he's just fine .
tough as nails .
a born worker .
ah , you pathetic little bugger !
run about !
run about !
how do you suppose he got here?
aah !
let's have a look .
see if his daddy's around .
aah !
aah !
hey , you slimy bastard !
god damn , he's got you hot and bothered !
don't worry .
i'll slow him down for you .
you ripped my face , you slimy little drac !
i'll make you pay .
uncle !
who the hell are you?
let him go !
uncle !
zammis , no !
uncle !

and so davidge brought zammis and the dracs home .
he fulfilled his vow ... and recited the line of zammis 'fore fathers ... before the holy council on dracon .
and when , in the fullness of time ,
zammis brought its own child before the holy council , the name of willis davidge ... was added to the line of jareeba .
