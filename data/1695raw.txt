its good that life runs in circles .
but mine exists of one circle , not even a whole one .
the most important is missing .
i have written her name so many times in my mind .
here , at this moment , i cant close anything .
i am alone .
as a child , surrounded by the world , i felt safe .
but on a cold afternoon , after school ... something happened .
i knew nothing about girls .
where do girls run to?
why did they stare at me?
if she wouldnt have stared like that , i would have kept running untill i had the ball .
or especially there , if the shoe of the guy hit the ball the right way ... then i would have stayed on the field and i could have been on the goal .
everyone would have congratulated me .
but it didnt go like that .
i like cold weather .
what about you?
i dont .
why?
winters should be cold , so you appreciate the spring more .
i love summer , the hot weather .
life runs in cycles .
everything emerges and dies again .
not everything .
do you know something that lasts forever?
thats how life is , inevitable .
happy and sad .
time affects everything .
also love .
if you run out of gas for example , you get stranded on the road .
you have to accept problems in your life .
because they come and go .
they never last forever .
iil be right back .
its not my fault .
your mother and i are getting a divorce .
my child .
i will always love you .
and if i run out of gas , iil die .
airmail .
how is this journey going to end?
are there any questions?
eight year old children ask 33 questions per hour , did you know that?
i even ask more , but always the same question .
are there really no questions?
may i go to the toilet?
is that your only question?
i think you have a much more important question .
do girls ask the same questions as we do?
let me think .
they ask less questions .
girls of your age are more grown up .
did you read that?
whom are they from?
its loaded with it .
i would be ashamed like crazy if i got this .
what a poseur ...
theres only one sentence .
everytime the same .
romantical , huh?
thats the big question of life .
i decided i had to talk to her .
firstly i would ask her name .
i would say my name is otto , also possible to read from right to left .
hello , my name is ana .
iil wait here as long as needed .
i am waiting for the biggest concidence of my life .
i have encountered many kinds of concidence .
concidence forms the path of my life .
the first and most important time was the worst .
it came like a drama .
my mom came to pick me up from school with terrible news .
stop crying , then it wont happen .
that stupid car .
stop it , i say .
if i say no , i mean no .
can you walk backwards?
a few hours?
your whole life?
it was my fathers life .
if his daughter didnt run . who would?
where did he come from?
from the death of my father?
maybe to make it up to me that he died to early .
i thought it was himself .
that night i viewed his youth pictures .
they didnt look like eachother .
but that didnt matter .
as a child i began to believe that my dad was living on as a boy .
but better than him .
i got enough of seeing my mother cry .
dry your tears .
daddy isnt dead .
how did it happen?
when its cold , most things happen faster .
concidences , i mean .
i love cold weather .
i love cold weather .
on a cold day i read a loveletter , too beautiful to be from a child .
i had to share the message with someone .
here , mom .
how pretty .
from whom is that?
it comes from ... ... that mister .
really?
if you dont want it , i want it back .
what are you saying?
i think its beautiful .
it was him again .
the message came from my father .
cold , huh?
thats right .
my name is olga .
mine is lvaro .
i heard his name .
if i wanted to wait too .
what a sucker .
what got into you?
you are getting crazier every day .
hes soaked .
you dont have to bring us home .
iil bring him to his mom so he can take a bath .
ok , otto?
then iil bring you home .
h , im here .
im ana .
do you remember?
say something .
my name is otto
do you know your name?
no .
yes , i do .
you can also read ana from right to left .
ofcourse .
thats a palindrom .
did you notice it just now?
did you notice it just now?
my dad said a palindrom as name brings luck .
and it changed my life .
i dont feel so good .
whats wrong?
i dont know .
i feel sick .
do you know why i am called otto?
not right now .
iil walk a bit further .
im near my home .
i am stubborn and not easy to convince .
i decided that otto spoke from outside and my father from inside .
i spent a lot of time beside him .
i spoke with him , without otto hearing me .
mothers boyfriend is only for her , right?
you are my only dad .
one is enough for me .
good bye .
say hi to your mother .
see you tomorrow .
a kiss .
give me one too if you hear me .
hello otto .
had a nice sleep?
very nice .
the fact that ana seemed so weird , admitted my love .
your dad made a promotion .
didnt you tell that?
he doesnt even know what i do .
he has a bigger office now .
your dad is very busy .
ana , you can talk with eachother sometime .
you are almost brother and sister .
i dont want a brother .
and i dont want a sister .
oh well , you just need to get used to it .
we will sleep in our new house today .
you can see it if its all done .
come and stay over for a weekend .
all of a sudden everything changed .
are you hurt?
are you crazy?
you have to stop right now .
i have two children in my car .
dont try that again .
get your papers please .
get out , i have to leave the car here .
take the bus from now on .
you are old enough .
different houses , different busses .
i only saw her in the weekends .
once every 2 weeks .
i couldnt wait any longer .
i wanted to admit my love to ana and know what she thought about me .
ana , my dear , i love you .
it took my dad a long time to leave otto and really die .
do you know why my name is otto?
on a sunday afternoon i finally listened to otto .
you be quiet now .
at the bombing of guernica my grandfather went angry into the forrest .
he saw a german pilot who jumped with his parachute .
the german was stuck in a tree .
you there .
your gun .
if he dropped his gun my grandfather would help him .
the pilot did it .
my grandfather kept his promiss .
after that they smoked half a sigaret .
my name is otto .
otto the pilot .
the pilot said he would be grateful forever .
my grandfather gave him back his pistol and the german gave my grandfather the sigaret .
he was almost out .
my mother is german .
my grandfather told my father that she was a gift from the german pilot .
thats why i am named after him , otto .
otto the pilot .
ofcourse .
its late .
your mother is waiting for you .
but why did he safe him?
he was a fascist .
if i were that german , i would have never killed anyone again .
why was he called after a nazi?
the loveletter on that plane came from otto , not from my dad .
that story about the pilot is a joke , right?
that afternoon i knew that otto was in love with me .
i want to be in love too .
i want to be in love too .
this is where the arctic circle runs .
there the sun wont go down in the summer .
thats the midnight sun .
thats weird , huh?
i couldnt say a word .
you arent listening .
are you bored?
i wish i were born without a tongue , that way i would have an excuse .
its only wednesday .
im going to live here .
and your mother?
i didnt tell her anything .
idiot .
otherwise it wouldnt be permitted .
ofcourse not .
im going to call her right now .
whats wrong?
he wants to live here .
without telling his mother or anyone else .
she hasnt got anything to say .
oh well , if its for a little while ..
whats wrong with that boy?
dont cry .
you always think you are sad .
easy now .
i dont know either why he wants to live here .
no , not live .
only for a little while .
iil give it to him .
maybe he wants to talk to you .
mom , i am sorry .
iil visit you every day after school .
come to my room tonight .
climb through the window .
be brave .
come on , your best smile .
be brave .
ana , im here .
wake up .
what do you think about our family picture?
what a nice list .
i already have a family .
one is enough for me .
you are lucky with two families .
do you have to be proud about that?
yes , we are a handsom family .
mom , here i am .
come , weil go out for a bit .
weil go to the mountains with the train .
one more left .
iil make nice pictures of you .
arent you there?
i guess you are shopping .
iil get some more photo material and call you .
when youre back again .
come back soon .
mom , its me .
i am back .
now one of you?
the camera is full .
you are very pretty .
thank you , my child .
i dont understand why daddy didnt love you anymore .
you cant understand things like that .
they just happen .
your father is a good man .
its not his fault ,
yes it is .
and hes not good .
you say that because you still love him .
no , i only love you .
the love of a child is forever .
id rather have that you were dead .
you are way too hard on your father .
apologize .
i wanted to do that , untill a second ago .
but not if you say it like that .
you cant ask for someones apologies .
'please , let my mother live again . '
ok , im sorry .
but you really have to change .
you have too much pride .
i am sorry , daddy , its all my fault .
i am going with you .
you cant .
i will go all the way down .
thats why .
you will jump off too fast .
thats too fast .
jump off .
stay with them .
i am going .
jump off .
there is the cliff .
why arent i dead .
i didnt know how many lives i had left ... but i only wanted to live with my mother at that moment .
i wanted to go back to her .
skii up .
but you are ana .
yes , my child .
do you want to be my mother?
i cant .
i remember my first time at the arctic circle .
being in love isnt easy .
next to desire you also have to hear it .
no one has a heart like otto .
neither do i.
its only wednesday .
one evening otto came to live with us .
he left his mother .
to see me every day .
and every night .
i love the smell of smoke .
it makes me think about otto the german .
he should still be alive .
i like it that your name is otto .
youre like my mother and im like your father .
i got very close with him .
i wanted to love him as much as he loved me .
where is otto?
hes not in bed .
you fell asleep .
i bet hes in the garden .
no , i looked everywhere .
get up , 8 oclock .
your brother is gone .
do you know where he is?
i dont know anything about otto .
and hes not my brother .
i cant stay any longer .
i have to go .
and your weird little son?
dont you worry .
i bet he went to his mother .
did you look under his bed?
ofcourse not .
why should i?
no idea .
i hear snoaring in his room .
otto , its 8 oclock .
we have been looking for you .
do something we can understand too .
do you always sleep naked here?
you dont live here alone , you know .
dont i get a morning kiss?
i never enjoyed sex as much as in that time with otto .
at home , sneaky .
i never had such a red heart as in that time .
how lovelly .
i bet your mom likes that .
i think its ugly .
please stop it .
did you decide?
i dont know .
i always think that color is ugly .
listen , the best hearts are red .
what will you give me for christmas?
snow .
as much as you like .
do you have a phone?
there is one outside .
iil call your dad and say weil come later .
this already costs two hours .
should i wrap it?
he will carry it .
your mother is coming .
here .
did you buy it?
i am running out of patience .
your dad is pretty cranky .
id like a red heart .
should i wrap it?
yes , its for my mother .
fine .
more hearts?
no , thats it .
can i borrow thousand peseta?
i also have to pay the cab .
very good .
brothers and sisters have to help eachother .
good evening , excuse me .
i am lvaro midelman of the spanish television .
do you perhaps want to do an audition for news reader?
excuse me?
i'm looking for someone of your age for the evening news .
excuse me ... but i accidentally heard you making that phone call .
it's just an audition .
youve got nothing to lose .
today in guernica a german delegation officially expressed their feelings of ... ... remorse to basque authorities .
during the ceremony , the german ambassador in spain held a speech .
he recognized the bombing on guernica for the first time ... in which back then 2000 civilians died .
what you just saw has no meaning .
i've got everything under control .
do you want to do something for your mother?
keep it secret .
i'm good in keeping secrets .
i'm never going to leave lvaro , the lvaro that's waiting home .
this one is also named lvaro .
believe me , i'll never leave you .
i'm your mother after all .
otto's mother died unexpectedly .
afterwards he would never be the same .
go away .
just leave .
otto wanted to die .
and i went with him .
stop it .
you are going to fast .
jump .
come on jump .
jump , there is the cliff .
answer me .
stay alive , do it for me .
we are going to get some help .
you go , but i stay here .
that's to dangerous .
i don't care .
come here , immediatelly .
otto , we are searching otto , damnit .
stop it .
you are not dead .
so i'm not going to cry .
otto , i found otto .
is he alright?
are you alright?
tell me you are .
you are ana .
yes , my child .
where is my mother?
nobody knows .
it depends on you .
otto didnt want to be with me any longer .
his guilt was so big that it enclosed me too .
where is your brother?
no idea .
he didn't sleep with me .
no jokes for a moment .
did you see his room?
i've looked under his bed .
and in the closet?
look in it .
with him you can expect anything .
i was hoping so much that he would be in there .
your son has left .
asleep .
naked .
how long will you stay?
don't know yet .
will you open the door , please?
otto took money from his father .
a lot of money .
ana , i want to talk to you .
what's wrong with you?
you have to see a psychiatrist .
my mother left lvaro .
she asked me if i wanted to live with her .
the money i had stolen was almost gone .
so i travelled on .
but i didn't want to live anywhere .
i still know that it was spring .
vacancies
do you have a cigarette for me?
they are heavy , though .
i smoke everything .
vacancy : pilot long distance flights
thanks .
i know you .
are you serious?
sorry , i don't know you .
do you like fate?
depends if it's positive .
i was also taught by sofia .
ana .
my name is javier .
you left sofia , right?
i don't have luck anymore .
that's my fault .
i consumed all of it .
you are otto's sister .
our names are palyndroms .
you dont forget that very fast .
my life was empty .
by leaving ana i had no longer a destiny
i had to create one myself .
finland .
flying at night , during day sleeping .
what could a life like that bring me?
what are you doing here?
i just came to visit you .
i'm doing good .
you are a little late with that .
it's too late now .
i don't want to see you anymore .
that's mutually .
i'm not coming for you .
why did you come to live here?
you ruined my life .
are you happy now?
what's happened?
they are gone .
they left me .
i'm all nerves .
where are they?
no idea .
and ana?
somewhere .
she lives together with a teacher from your old school .
who?
someone who couldn't help you .
he now fucks your sister , who is 20 years younger .
the world is getting greedy .
with a lot of bastards .
i see how you are doing .
you never saw anything .
you didnt see me either .
i'm your father , aren't i?
i'm really sorry .
it's too late for that now .
everything is broken here .
do you still love olga?
draw a person .
who?
you can choose .
give it to me .
is this yours?
whom is it?
here , you are .
who is that?
my mother .
she's very beautiful .
yes , she died of love .
how can you die of love?
she was left alone .
are you kidding?
she was german .
she died while washing salad .
ana , what a surprise .
how are you doing?
pretty good .
and you?
are you still with your teacher?
he's not my teacher .
and i'm a teacher too now .
how is your mother doing?
good .
she has been thinking of going to australia .
much too far away .
if you let her go , you'll never see her back .
he's in portugal since last summer .
how is otto doing?
no idea .
well , i think .
you know how he is .
he doesn't tell where he lives or works .
but from time to time he calls me or visits me unexpectedly .
if you had acted like brother and sister ... everything would be like it was .
lend me some money .
what has happened?
i've left javier .
i saw that coming .
what are you going to do now?
i want to leave for a while .
this is very bad timing .
we are going to australia next month .
have a nice trip .
wait , don't be so proud .
stay over here untill we leave .
but after it has been rented .
this is the first place where javier will come and look for me .
you can join us to australia .
that's too far for me .
too far , too close ...
it's never good enough .
what do you want?
i don't know .
i want to go away .
where to?
to lapland .
do me a favor .
think about it .
you can't just leave your husband whom you have been living with for 4 years .
you own nothing and you don't even have a plan .
you are always very practical , yes .
do you want to go to lapland?
my father lives in finland , in a town called rovaniemi .
he has a little house near the lake , inside the polar circle .
next month the sun doesn't go down at night .
that's the midnight sun .
another world .
you smoke to much .
i'm bored with this disaster movies .
as a child you loved air fights and fighters , remember?
i've changed radically .
so hard?
completely .
are you scared for airplains now?
did you ever fly?
yes .
and i'm not affraid of it .
i'm going home .
visit me more often .
next week again .
oh yes , there's been a letter for you last week .
it's on the table .
who sent it?
there's no name on it .
only an address in finland .
66 33 40 north 02 55 05 east
i recognized the plane number and the package number .
it mostly surprised me that i had transported it myself , without knowing .
who would also know it?
'i look at night to the sun and wait for you .
be brave .
descend through the window . '
be brave .
'the fate we both waited for . '
iil stay here tonight .
fine , you still have your own room .
'the fate we both waited for . '
i've met the real otto , the pilot who rescued your grand dad .
it was a good thing that he rescued him and shared a cigaret with him .
he went to finland with a spanish girl .
he left the war .
his son is called lvaro , my mothers friend .
what do you say about that?
and it becomes even better .
otto said farewell to your grand dad .
he travelled along and saw a bombed house .
he saw a man .
he was dead .
his daughter cried .
he was all she had .
when she saw otto , she ran away .
otto followed her .
here name was cristina .
she was only 17 and ran very fast .
but then she fell .
otto stood still and looked at her in a way ... ... that she felt he asked for pardon .
for everything .
and it really went like that .
otto promised silently that he would take care of her if she would forgive him .
here is the little house .
between the forest and the lake .
exactly on the polar circle .
they can deliver your food , even in the winter .
you have to go the shop in the village .
i hope it is still open .
since the dead of my wife i haven't been there .
that has been 7 years .
she was a spanish , just like you .
she looks young here .
almost a child .
there she is only 17 .
she was my life .
there was something with this guy .
something alarming .
why are u named otto?
there is no explanation for that .
life contains much things that are not explainable .
but otto is a name that's very frequent in germany .
are you a german?
i'm a finn now .
only my name is still german .
it's such a geometric name , otto .
and me ana .
i 've been thinking about that .
you can read our names the same way .
from left to right and visa versa .
do you want an explaination for that?
there might be none .
could be .
on the day my wife died , i got mail from my son .
he wrote he fell in love with a spanish girl .
why?
i was with my mother that day .
i got a present as well .
and now i've got a very beautiful spanish granddaughter .
you are here thanks to cristina .
i feel her hand in yours .
thanks , otto .
it's nice to know you .
the polar circle .
there had been something known mixed together with the unknown .
i was on my final destination .
i had a weird feeling , the first of many .
i felt the present of fate .
that could be otto .
otto had sent me .
the owner of this house .
he asked me if i could bring this .
thats very sweet .
come in .
do you know if otto used to be a pilot?
i don't know .
but his wife was a spanish , just like you .
he met her in spain .
he was brought her over here .
she came alone , like me .
i didn't know that .
for how long will you stay?
i'll see how long i can hold out .
bye .
i thought all day about otto .
i couldn't be calmed down .
one morning i heard a car .
it was the mail car .
i thought : if i run , there is something in it for me .
do you have something for me?
i'm ana lopez .
let there be something for me .
its from australia .
hallo , ana .
hallo , mum .
australia is the ideal place to start over again .
forget the north and come over to live with your mother .
first i want to say to you ...
what is it?
i think alot about you .
everyday more and more .
more than ever before .
sorry .
now you just sound like my mother .
your mother is getting old .
and good .
that would be about time .
very nice .
fantastic .
lvaro's father is very happy , that he has met you .
he calls you his granddaughter .
he's happy .
you have brought warmth in his house again .
he's named otto , but you already knew that probably .
of course .
but did you know that otto is a pilot?
which otto?
the story about that german pilot who jumped with his parachute ...
well , forget about it .
you brother took that story so seriously that he became a pilot .
that's what we heard from someone who has flown with him .
we don't know where he works , but that doesn't matter .
he lives with his head in the sky .
otto the pilot .
of course .
the polar circle .
how will this journey end?
66 degrees , 33 minutes , 40 seconds , north .
2 degrees , 55 minutes , 5 seconds , east .
tonight there will be no sun down .
that spanish airplane must have had something for me .
who else?
i'll wait here as long as it takes .
i wait on the greatest luck in my life .
i have known a lot of different kinds of luck .
luck runs through my life like a continuous thread .
it's good that life passes in circles .
but mine consists of one circle , and not even a complete one .
the most important is missing .
i've written her name so often in my mind .
here , at this moment , i can't lock anything up .
i'm alone .
got something for me?
ok then , im tired .
i'm going home .
i'll be lunching soon .
did you hear about the airplane from spain?
last night a messenger plane crashed in the north of finland .
did someone die?
do you know the name of the pilot?
are you going to rovaniemi?
everything thats left , is for the city .
can i drive with you?
here you go .
thanks .
dont mention it .
where are you from?
spain .
what's your name?
aki .
i'm otto .
i'll never forget this .
thanks .
dont mention it .
do you have a cigarette?
no .
never mind .
the rest is going great .
thanks .
dont mention it .
do you know a spanish woman , ana?
do you know where she lives?
over there .
good bye .
thanks .
oh , dont mention it .
she's not there right now .
she isnt?
no , i just saw her in a car .
we passed on the road .
where was she heading?
i dont know .
it was a messenger car .
ana is a messenger?
like me?
no , she was with the messenger .
rovaniemi is that way .
the eyes of ana
thank you .
what has happened?
translate it for me .
calm down .
it doesn't really matter at the moment .
there is someone here that wants to see you .
oh?
who is it?
how did you come here?
with my parachute .
you were in that plane .
that's him , right?
the german pilot .
the one who smoked with your granddad .
thats right .
otto in the eyes of ana
music calms you down .
can you skii up hill?
otto lives over there .
in memory of my father
