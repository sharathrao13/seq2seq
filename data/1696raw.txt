oh ...
trish ..
oh i knew that's how you'd react , but i'm telling you , it's true .
i've been watch you ...
my doctor says just once a month .
i know ...

i'm so happy .
you are?
yeah i mean being around you and the kids and you know kooki .
you really are?
yeah .
oh , honey ... l'm so happy you're happy .
cause all this time i've been thinking you were so miserable .
oh , trish !
that's too funny , when i couldn't be happier .
you know ... lt's just , what with your music career never really ...
oh , my career's fine !
oh i know , i know , it will be !
i just know it !
and then you'll move out of mom and dad's ...
real soon !
and you'll meet mr. right !
oh , i will .
already i feel i'm off to a fresh start !
that's right .
i mean ...
just because you've hit 30 doesn't mean ... you can't be fresh anymore .
uh huh .
you know ... joy , i've never told you this before ... ... but now that we're older , and ... ... l feel so bonded to you ... ... well ... the ... the truth is ...
i know this is going to sound horrible ... but i just feel i have to be fully open with you and just ... ... get beyond all the old barriers , and the sibling nonsense you know i ...
oh , well , the truth is i always thought you would never amount to much .
that you'd end up alone , without a career or anything .
you know ...
really , it's what we all thought .
mom , dad , helen ... everyone ...
i'd always prayed we'd all be wrong , but ... some how you always just seemed so ... doomed to failure .
but now i see , that's not true .
there's a glimmer of hope for you after all .
but i'm sorry , i know i'm repeating myself ...
i'm just really happy for you .
oh ... trish .
and how is this different
i don't kill myself at the end .
do you see this as something positive?
gee , well ... l ... l don't know .
how do you feel at the end?
much better .
i wake up ... happy ... feeling good ... but then i get very depressed because i'm ...
iiving in reality .
and what about your family .
trish is good to me .
but ... still no sex .
no . but she's not too interested either , so really ... there's no problem there ... when you think about it ... ... on a certain level .
mom
okay , kids get in the car .
can we go for ice cream?
sweetie .
hey .
hi hon , how was work today?
oh , fine .
hey , billy !
what's going on?
nothing
he's " depressed .
well is anything the matter?
i don't wanna talk about it .
ignore him .
he's just doing it for attention .
he thinks you'll be impressed .
as if ...
so anyway ... joy came by today .
how's she doing?
oh , god , i dunno , and frankly ...
i'm concemed .
i mean , she's not like me .
you know she doesn't " have it all " .
she pretends to be happy , but i can see right through her , she's miserable .
why do you think that is?
well to be frank , i think she's lazy .
she's not a go getter , like me or helen .
and she's so picky .
i gave damien ross her phone number , for what it's worth , and ...
joy sounded interested , naturally , but ... l dunno .
i'm afraid i have to say it , but truly its what i believe ... ... she'll always be alone .
we're all alone .
oh bill ... ... sometimes i wonder how any of your patients can talk to you !
sometimes i wonder if they'll ever stop .
i should tape some for you .
oh bill , would you?
would you really?
so that i could listen , too?
no .
oh come on ... you're such a tease .
you know i wouldn't tell anyone .

i tried so many times to tell you but it's hard to umm ..
i'd always been very friendly to him .

i don't care , i'm still friendly . t's my way .
but , umm ... pedro was different .
pedro never snickered .
of course , who was he to snicker?

i was coming home from the 24 hour pathmark .. lt was late ...
good evening .
miss hope .
hi , pedro .
can you help me with these bags?

and i had a ...
half gallon of strawberry ice cream two boxes of fudge , and a key lime pie
and uh , i just couldn't wait to get home and get ... under the covers and watch tv .
but umm ... it was in the elevator that i first got a funny feeling ...
iike he was umm you know kind of looking at me , kind of funny ...
and i thought maybe he was just being friendly too ... l mean ... you know just umm ... two friendly people .
umm ... would you mind putting those in the kitchen for me?
no problem .
thanks so much , pedro .
no problem .
oh ... l'm so sorry .

did you know , bill?
no .
muh ... you got that , billy
well ... lt's what everyone says : she's a junkie .

it's really sad .
well if mrs. paley turns out , if fact , to be a junkie , then ... she should be fired .
don't you think so , bill?
i don't know .
don't you think that's a little harsh?
i mean if it's not affecting her work
well, apparently it is .
and no , in fact , i don't think it's a little harsh at all .
i'm sorryu , but when it come to drug abuse ... and children , my children ...
uch , they should all just be locked up and throw away the key .
and billy , i want you to know something , if you ever even t think of doing drugs , and end up dying in a hospital ... l'd disown you .
that's how strongly i feel about it .
trish .
