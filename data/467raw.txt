not china .
not yet .
passepartout?
you look troubled .
i cannot keep lying to mr. fogg .
thank you , miss la roche .
you may just have saved our trip .
you did what you had to .
the fate of your village is of far greater importance
there you are .
i would , uh ... than any bet phileas has made .
i would like to repay you .
take me with you .
if he loses , all it will cost him his money and pride .
what?
i'm stifled here .
pigeonholed .
no , mr. fogg will lose much more than that .
they think of me only as a coat check girl !
what do you mean?
why?
because i am the coat check girl .
ah .
look .
the leading art critic in paris .
my village !
look what he wrote about one of my paintings .
i can't read this .
it's french .
i wish i couldn't .
your village?
uh ...
i mean ,
why do you carry it?
when i do succeed , i can throw it in his face , but for now , my , what a village !
oh , it's beautiful !
i need a world journey to inspire me .
we do need to stop and resupply , but we must be off by morning .
i'm inspired to get us back on schedule .
let's see .
wind velocity approximately twelve knots ,
factoring in air density ...
outstanding !
passepartout , onward !
ah .
lau xing , lau xing .
lau xing , lau xing .
lau xing .
lau xing .
lau xing .
there we go .
passepartout , tell him to keep the change .
uh ...
fromage , por favor .
we are going around the world in 80 days !
goodness , that's quite a welcome .
do these people know him?
it must be their custom , the way they welcome all strangers .
the balloon cannot support all this weight !
your hot air should compensate , no?
lau xing .
lau xing .
get off !
what are they doing?
they're being disorderly .
hey !
let go !
let go !
hey !
passepartout !
my valise !
it has all my money in it .
whoo !
lau xing .
hey , lady , lady , lady !
it's my bag .
lau xing .
no , that is my bag .
lau xing .
no , that's not your bag .
it's my bag !
no !
you crazy .
ah .
uh ...
yes .
that tickles !
you took my bag .
mr. fogg !
good catch !
thank you .
oh .
it's beautiful .
you are very talented .
ooh !
thank you .
you need more blue .
those are the gallery bandits .
fascinating .
absolutely fascinating .
oh , yes !
sorry?
ah .
he stole my purse !
this devil stole my purse !
vile .
absolutely vile .
welcome home , lau xing .
your brothers will be proud .
the whole notion of a lighter than air craft cannot work ,
my bag !
he took my ...
ah !
unless you can harness the power of helium .
or hydrogen , which is far better ...
we've stolen that old lady's purse .
huh .
here .
yes , well , couldn't have put it better myself .
as for this englishman , do you think such an association is wise?
we must help passepartout .
how do i make this go lower?
what are you doing?
decrease the overall weight ...
he is the most disciplined man i have ever met .
that's not going to work .
yes , it is .
the crane !
the monkey .
very frightening .
physics , no?
snake .
yes .
and , of course , the eagle .
phileas?
phileas , i made this for you .
oh , yes .
oh , that's very , very good .
yes .
ahhh ...
ooh !
ay !
owww .
what does this say?
stupid .
lau xing ...
bonjour .
bonjour .
eh?
bye bye !
wake up , lady !
wake up , lady !
wake up !
lady , wake up !
i've had quite enough .
i just ...
i ...
bye , mama .
merci .
bye , baby .
ohh ...
very impressive .
i'd have let go by now .
the statue's grabbing his trousers .
ahhh .
i am going to be abominably ill .
i don't think it's doing it on purpose .
oh , dear .
i ...
i want to die .
please kill me .
help !
well done , passepartout .
we're still on schedule despite those dogged thieves .
yes , yes .
thank you .
those art thieves seemed to recognize you .
i look like someone they know .
some other frenchman , perhaps?
i will find the fastest way to china .
so , where can we drop you off?
we're not stopping .
it's strong .
once we land to board the orient express , you are free to go .
thank you so much .
for what?
i'm free to go with you .
i did not say you were free to come .
mr. fogg , i was going to tell you .
i said you were free to go .
where?
anywhere .
thank you .
i will go with you .
this is your family .
my name is not passepartout .
no , you will not , miss la roche .
monique .
it is lau xing .
miss ...
monique !
there !
now we are getting along .
i robbed the bank of england .
you robbed the bank of england?
comme c'est beau .
not for gold or money , but for the jade buddha .
c'est magnifique .
it was stolen from our village .
toutes ces couleurs .
phileas , he had no other choice .
this was his only way to get home .
look at the sunrise .
there is only one word for it .
" magical .
miss la roche !
i refuse to allow you to continue traveling with us .
you knew about this?
well ...
i'm not traveling with you .
i'm making my own way .
i have nothing but respect for you , mr. fogg .
maybe you shouldn't travel with me .
this is what happens when you leave your home .
then respect my deductive reasoning .
you meet ... people !
you have both used me .
you to escape to china , and you to travel to further your impressionistic humbug !
why are you keeping up this ruse?
your overtures of ... comradeship , of friendship , of ...
perhaps i should inform mr. fogg , and together he and i can speculate .
all that was a means to ensure i would take you along .
my entire life , i got along splendidly by myself .
you've been pebbles in my shoe , slowing me down , endangering my life ,
a very sacred object was stolen from my village .
risking everything , all i've ever lived for .
i have taken it back .
and you !
you knew that .
incroyable .
for many centuries , the jade buddha has protected my people .
it has never left our village until now .
don't let him go .
he'll be lost by midnight .
go !
and those art thieves .
who are they?
the black scorpions .
they work for an evil warlord .
fang .
more of your relatives , i suppose .
she wants the buddha so she can take over my village .
i must return the jade buddha to protect lanzhou .
you can just forget about a reference .
i beg a thousand pardons , mr. fogg .
mr. fogg is the fastest way .
perhaps , then , we can help one another .
i will keep your secret , and you convince mr. fogg
to allow me to travel the world with you .
what's he screaming about?
he's saying , " please , let me go .
i'm bored .
why is he in prison?
keep this dummkopf in his seat , or we throw him off !
merely pointing out if they coordinated their coal shoveling technique ,
urinating in public .
charming .
they could maximize our speed .
at least he had the decency to be forthcoming about it .
when we reach constantinople , i suggest you board a train we are not on .
is there anything you've told me that's even remotely true?
i really can sing .
uh , mr. fogg , she must come with us .
and why is that? frre jacques , frre jacques dormez vous
uh , we just discovered that we are related from the same family . dormez vous sonnez les matines sonnez les matines ding , ding , ding ding , ding , ding
ding , dang , dong , passepartout .
ding , dang , dong .
i'm her father's second cousin's sister on my mother's side .
french .
look !
monsieur fogg .
if i make the train go faster , i can come with you , oui?
oh , good .
here comes mr. grumpy and the leatherettes .
yes .
i bid you farewell , miss la roche .
where is the jade buddha?
you are better off killing me .
you have nerve .
are your comrades so brave?
your threats don't frighten me .
nor does your silly bracelet .
all right .
it's not silly .
if there's anything else you would like , just let us know , miss la roche .
i spit on you !
france spits on you !
ah !
voil .
vive i'anjou !
champagne with your first class seats , mademoiselle la roche .
your turn will come soon enough .
coward !
merci .
leave them alone .
fight me .
champagne?
no , thank you .
yes , fight him .
let's see how ferocious you really are .
merci .
monsieur .
a tea?
okay .
how to make english tea .
precisely 96 degrees .
ooh .
hey , that's cheating !
excuse me , sir .
fogg's valet !
look out !
huh?
left !
a jade buddha !
this is not a jade buddha .
oh , yes , it is !
you're right .
but i'm not a valet .
behind you !
oh .
really?
no !
owww !
hit them !
silence !
me bloody nose !
let me in !
you're gonna pay for scorchin 'me willy !
you savages !
phileas , help him !
watch out on the right .
huh?
no , my right .
stop helping me !
what's happening?
heh heh heh heh .
now i gotcha .
where is passepartout?
how is he getting on?
ow !
oh !
ow !
i wouldn't say he's winning , but , uh , i think he's doing all right .
ahhh !
you're under arrest !
ah !
ooh !
ow !
go home to mama .
sorry !
huh?
why the devil are we stopping?
what took you so long?
i had to finish my lunch .
prince hapi would be honored to have fogg and his traveling companions at his banquet .
wong fei hung !
how very flattering .
surely you're not foolish enough to take on all of my men by yourself?
but please inform prince " happy " that we are on a very tight schedule .
prince hapi demands it .
then prince hapi will have to get accustomed
ten tigers?
to not getting everything he wants .
kill them !
execute the prisoners !
i want their heads on pikes !
what's happening?
phileas !
ohhh !
passepartout ...
knife !
merci .
you're welcome .
you promise me that black scorpions will never come back to lanzhou .
these are my brothers and sister .
the ten tigers .
but there are only nine .
including me .
they're real .
the legend was true .
mr. fogg ...
passepartout , or whatever your name is , save your apologies .
phileas , he risked his life for what he believes in .
if anyone understands that , you do .
please ensure miss la roche finds safe passage home .
this should be adequate .
oh .
i , uh , believe this is your veil .
i will never dress like a woman again .
ever .
mr. fogg .
please let me help you win your bet .
i have secured the services of a more reliable gentleman .
yes .
well , perhaps i'll just , uh , travel alone .
fifi la belle !
she sings !
she dances !
she does the dance of the ...
you , sir , come right in .
see miss fifi la belle in all her ...
ah , the most modern city in the world .
finally , civilization .
yoo hoo !
excuse me .
pardon me .
can anyone direct me to the pacific railroad station?
oh , i'm so sorry , sir .
i'm such a ... rutabaga sometimes .
no , no , no .
please , it's my fault entirely .
let me , uh ...
oh ...
ah !
oh .
oh , lord , i think i sprained my knee .
uh !
ooh .
i should find you a physician .
there's a doctor who has an office around the corner .
excellent .
well , uh , i'll get him for you .
thank you .
there should be more people like you in this world .
whoo , doggy !
jackpot !
whoo !
mon dieu .
can you imagine phileas alone in a place like this?
i'm sure he's fine .
alms .
alms .
alms for the poor?
arms?
you already got arms .
it's money you need .
i can't even scrounge proficiently .
hey .
cheer up , pal .
you just gotta figure out what'll work for you .
now , what makes you different from them?
i'm hungry and miserable .
no .
you stink .
your stink is your most powerful weapon in your begging arsenal .
watch this .
hey .
give me money .
sure .
don't touch me .
you stink .
that guy smells like a dead horse !
i'm not proud of it .
simple , yet effective .
yeah , i see .
you try .
give it a shot .
i got faith in you .
excuse me .
now , uh , you ...
ah .
i'm not gonna lie to you .
that's gonna happen about half the time .
it's a volume business .
hunk of cheese?
oh , yes , i would rather ...
maybe later .
what are them drawings?
you some kind of devil worshipper?
don't you be putting a hex on me .
i'll cut you .
i'm an inventor .
that's nice .
or , rather , i was .
one day i will build a machine that will allow man to fly .
flying men?
where?
nowhere .
where are the flying men?
where are the flying men?
over there .
the bird men are coming !
i knew it !
the bird men are coming !
the bird men are coming !
the birds !
the bird men !
bird men !
birds !
i traveled the world for inspiration and found it in a man ... who lives what he dreams .
phileas?
no .
passepartout !
monique !
mr. fogg .
you crossed the pacific ocean .
for me?
we will help you win your bet .
mr. fogg , i would never let you down .
but why would you do this?
because you are our friend , and perhaps ... more .
more with her .
you and me?
we just stick with friends .
ooh .
oof !
lord kelvin , i can offer you something much more precious than a single jade buddha .
beneath lanzhou are a series of untapped jade reserves .
if the town were to be overrun , those reserves would be ours .
i see .
however , should phileas fogg win this race ,
i will have neither the power nor the means to hand over any arsenal .
then i will see to it personally that mr. fogg's journey is cut short .
very well .
let us consider our deal to be ...
still , it's a first rate idea , sir .
what's this blocking my jade reserves?
that will have to be demolished .
but that is the great wall of china , sir .
but that is the great wall of china , sir .
it's not that great .
passepartout went to get help hours ago .
what if he's lost , or ...
don't fret , my dear .
passepartout's a warrior with impeccable survival instincts .
no doubt he'll return with help , and we will board our train with time to spare .
agua .
perhaps i'm being a little optimistic .
help !
help us !
help !
ah !
a rattlesnake !
help !
i don't want to die !
ah .
good morning .
howdy .
hey .
crazy english cowboy wannabe man .
how's about going someplace else?
you're blocking the path .
wilbur , it's him .
i'll be damned .
mr. fogg , my name is orville wright .
this is my brother , wilbur .
we're big fans of yours .
fan's a strong word .
better way to say it's we got a lot of money riding on you to win your bet .
we're gonna use our winnings to build this .
orville , maybe now is not the time .
let me explain it to mr. fogg .
just one second .
forgive my brother .
he's got his head up in the clouds .
he's one of these dreamers who thinks man's gonna go swooshing around on the planet like a little hummingbird .
yeah , we're all gonna fly .
he thinks so , too .
it's kind of sad .
i'm sorry .
he's kind of a moron .
he's mastered the cable steering system .
the drag and lift ratio .
this is brilliant .
thank you .
that's what i've been saying , but orville doesn't listen .
all that stuff about mastering ...
that's what i say .
you gotta have faith in me , no matter how crazy big brother's dreams sound .
but you told me ...
you gotta have confidence .
you've got to speak up and support me .
excuse me , gentlemen .
have you come across our friend on your way here?
who are we looking for?
passepartout .
you mean the crazy , half naked chinese guy we saw running around , where he was like ...
singing " frre jacques "?
with a cow skull on his head?
possibly .
yes .
he's in the back of the wagon .
passepartout .
you are alive !
is that you , grandma?
bye bye .
good luck .
go win the bet .
no pressure , but you gotta win it .
bye .
now , you see , to get the real classy dames , you gotta invent stuff .
i did .
i did "?
what's with the " i did "?
we're the wright brothers .
we did .
now go .
hyah !
hyah !
they're not going to make it !
ah ha ha !
new york , new york !
so much to see !
so little time !
our steamer leaves in ten minutes !
go , go , go !
go , go , go !
we're never going to make it .
phileas fogg?
autograph this for me?
it's for the wife .
certainly .
this business about me robbing the bank of england ...
ah , i'm from ireland .
nice goin '.
the boat .
follow me .
i know a shortcut .
make a lane !
make a lane !
where are we?
ah !
whoa !
that's a big man .
it is a lady .
a french lady .
she looks like an evil chinese warlord to me .
your journey has caused quite a stir , mr. fogg , but i'm afraid it ends here .
leave them alone .
this has nothing to do with them .
on the contrary , lau xing ,
lord kelvin and i have made new arrangements to conquer lanzhou .
unfortunately for mr. fogg , they entail his ... permanent detour .
i knew kelvin was duplicitous , but to align himself with such a little scoundrel !
you're not a scoundrel , but you are quite small !
as in petite , but most definitely lethal and generally very scary .
one , two ...
go !
three !
go up there .
stop them .
passepartout , my cane !
uh , there .
passepartout !
help !
we are trapped !
help !
passepartout !
help !
there you are !
you have a knife in your buttock .
it's the evil chinese warlord !
ooh !
huh?
she's coming !
the boat !
up there !
hurry !
go , go , go !
go , mr. fogg .
there's not much time .
wait , wait !
what am i thinking?
passepartout can't defeat them .
he's nine tigers short .
phileas , i do believe you are becoming the man of my dreams .
when this is over , let's hope the arms and legs of the man of your dreams are still attached to the torso ... of the man of your dreams .
you have failed to stop him .
then your death will have to suffice .
let go of me !
the book !
it's going to fall !
how can we save ...
phileas?
i will save him ...
wah !
mr. fogg !
no !
oh .
passepartout?
passepartout !
huh?
you're alive !
are you injured?
yes , well , uh ...
rules are made to be broken .
or , uh , stabbed by a spiky shoe .
mr. fogg , you missed the ship .
you'll lose your bet .
oh .
at least i didn't lose a friend .
you must be the eleventh tiger .
meow !
let's go .
we must catch the next ship .
it would never reach london in time .
no .
no !
no !
we are not giving up !
i almost died !
you almost died !
we take the next ship and win that bet !
very well .
let's go .
yes !
thank you .
yes .
yes !
yes !
oh , it's hopeless .
by those calculations , i'm still behind by one day .
there must be some way !
phileas fogg on my boat?
what an honor , sir !
i've quite a penny wagered on you .
the wife's none too happy about it .
then again , she hasn't cracked a smile since that shark almost devoured me .
got 'em both in one bite .
ah , it's inspector fix !
my goodness !
he made it around the world before fogg !
i came back from india the short way , you ninny !
i take it you don't have phileas fogg in that valise .
a little jade buddha , perhaps?
that's the last of the coal , captain .
mr. fogg .
i'm sorry to say , we've burnt the last of the coal .
but i've had a word with the crew , and all of them ... have agreed to burn their shoes .
the effort is appreciated , captain .
unfortunately , we've gained a mere six hours .
even shoes cannot help us now .
must be something we can do .
that's it .
i've got it .
birds .
excellent idea !
we'll burn birds !
no , we'll fly to london .
we follow the laws of physics mastered by the birds millennia ago and combine it with the wright brothers 'steering system .
most people would laugh at you .
but not us .
we care about you .
captain , i'm afraid i have to ask permission to dismantle your ship to build this machine .
dismantle carmen?
but she's me livelihood , me most loyal companion .
never , never , ever !
what if i could direct you to an impeccable physician who could replace both your nipples , at my expense , and i will give you enough money to buy a brand new ship?
you had me at the nipples .
cornelius , fetch me me tools !
now !
aye , aye , captain !
one , two !
one , two !
timber !
i'll go sharpen the propeller .
wrong way .
not looking .
just one more .
that's it !
right , lads , tie it off !
the greenwich time zone .
the last time i shall set my watch ahead .
well ...
shall we fly?
let's .
mr. fogg .
hurrah !
hurrah !
inspiring words .
very well .
prepare for takeoff !
yes , sir !
mr. fogg , are you sure?
no !
whoa !
how the hell are we getting back?
whoa !
now !
ohhh !
you did it , phileas !
we are flying !
my god !
it's ... magical !
better than your dreams?
better than my dreams .
hey !
don't forget to steer !
it's a ... a telegram from ...
general fang , sir .
we're going to make it !
this all right?
oh , dear .
this is exactly like a dream i had .
you dream of winning the race?
no , of crashing to my death .
don't worry .
i'm gonna get it .
look up there !
great scott !
look !
a flying machine !
don't step on the wing !
it's phileas fogg !
sir , rumor has it a flying machine is heading for the royal academy , our bank thief at the pedals .
some people will believe anything .
a flying machine is heading for the academy !
the bank thief is pedaling !
see what i mean?
help !
well done , passepartout !
the wing ropes !
just a minor setback .
another minor setback .
all right , this is a major setback .
a flying machine is headed for the royal academy , and witnesses swear that it's phileas fogg .
faster , passepartout !
faster !
we're losing altitude !
landing gear?
that would have been an excellent idea !
the bird men are here !
no .
i will not lose this wager !
he is not to reach the top step .
get the police .
here .
now !
i want fogg arrested the moment his feet touch british soil !
oh !
i'm sorry ...
right in my ear !
passepartout , get back in your seat .
we're going to return to the ground !
stop !
kitchner !
hold your ground !
why are they fleeing?
cowards !
hold on !
make it to the top step !
new zealand .
we didn't go there .
top step .
arrest them !
they robbed the bank of england !
no , no !
nonsense !
where is your proof?
this is the royal academy of science !
we don't need to prove anything !
besides which , by the time you get out of jail , you'll have lost the wager .
noon .
we did our best .
out of me way !
move it !
i used to be somebody important !
should have thrown him through a higher window .
get off !
get rid of this buffoon !
that's the thanks i get for going halfway around the world to stop fogg?
he also sent a chinese warlord to kill phileas fogg !
that's right .
he did !
lies !
all of it !
kitchner !
yes?
tell them !
oh , well , yes , uh ...
well , the thing of it ...
you mumbling moron !
salisbury , translate kitchner's blather .
i ...
me ...
i ...
yes .
yes !
rhodes !
the thing of it is ,
i don't want to make a fuss .
you spineless cretins !
that man stuck me with quills !
bunches of them !
yes !
lord kelvin's a bully !
it's true !
i hate to admit it , but i'm a battered lord .
no !
oh , boo hoo !
so what if i did try to kill phileas fogg?
what are you gutless peons going to do about it?
i hold all the power !
i run everything !
so which of you half wits is going to stop me?
you?
you?
you?
the queen !
the queen?
oh , the queen !
that inbred , antiquated old cow !
the only way she could stop me is if she sat on me !
with her big , fat royal bottom !
she's behind me , isn't she?
oh , your majesty .
i have just apprehended the culprits who robbed the bank of england .
no , majesty !
rubbish !
quiet !
i love being able to do that .
so , lord kelvin , unsportsmanlike conduct , attempted murder , trading my arsenal for buddhas .
how do you know about that?
i never said ...
admit it .
you've been a naughty boy , haven't you?
your majesty , i assure you , there is an explanation for all of this .
what it was , was , was ...
i was ...
i ...
i was simply ... simply ...
why do they always run?
arrest him .
get out of my way , you fools !
unhand me !
don't you know who i am?
i'll kill you !
i'll have you for this , fogg !
so , is this phileas fogg's miraculous flying invention?
your majesty , we all invented it .
i'm very impressed , and that doesn't happen often .
thank you .
but still , we failed to help phileas win his bet .
i'm sorry , phileas .
don't be , my chri .
i saw the world .
i learnt of new cultures .
i flew across an ocean .
i wore women's clothing .
oh?
made a friend .
fell in love .
who cares if i lost a wager?
i do .
i've got 20 quid riding on you .
your majesty , it has gone 12 noon .
correct .
which gives you 24 hours remaining .
could we have miscounted?
no .
i moved mr. fogg's watch ahead one hour as we passed each time zone .
the international date line .
we set our watches forward at 20 more time zones , so ... here it's still day 79 .
so , we've ...
we've won !
we won , we won ...
thank god .
ah !
your majesty , i ...
i apologize .
do forgive me .
i quite forgot myself .
go and win your bet , mr. fogg .
i shall need a new minister of science .
uh , yes , of course , your majesty .
