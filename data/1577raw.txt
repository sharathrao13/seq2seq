doctor's ethics .
if you knew , you wouldn't tell?
no , i probably wouldn't .
not to bother you with trivia , but a psychiatrist ... ... in sunny california , no less ... ... was put in jail for not telling the police what he knew about a patient .
is that a threat?
no , i mention it only in passing .
incidentally , i mention it only in passing ... ... i could always tell the judge it was a matter of confession .
father , wait a minute !
do you like movies?
very much .
well , i get passes to the best shows in town .
mrs. k , you know , she gets tired , never likes to go .
that's too bad .
i hate to go alone .
i love to talk film ... ... discuss , to critique .
you want to see a film with me?
i've got passes to the crest .
it's othello .
who's in it?
groucho marx .
are you happy?
i've seen it .
one last time .
can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
come on !
no , answer the question , father paranoia .
all right .
you know who i think really did it?
who?
the dominicans .
go pick on them .
i could have you deported , you know that?
i lied .
you look like sal mineo .
a spirit , if you will .
look , i'm telling you again , and you'd better believe me ... ... i am not going to lock her up in some goddamn asylum !
and i don't care what you call it .
i'm not putting her away !
i'm sorry .
you're sorry?
jesus christ !
88 doctors and all you can tell me , with all your bullshit is ....
of course , there is one outside chance for a cure .
i think of it as a shock treatment .
as i said , it's a very outside chance .
would you just name it , for god's sake?
what is it?
do you have any religious beliefs?
no .
what about your daughter?
no .
why?
have you ever heard of exorcism?
well , it's a stylized ritual in which the ... ... rabbi or the priest try to drive out the so called invading spirit .
it's been discarded these days ... ... except by the catholics , who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment .
but it has worked ... ... in fact , although , not for the reasons they think .
it's purely force of suggestion .
the victim's belief in possession ... ... is what helped cause it , so in that same way ... ... the belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear .
you're telling me i should take my daughter to a witch doctor .
is that it?
might your daughter remember , perhaps ... ... if mr. dennings was in her room that night?
why do you ask?
might she remember?
did you put this in regan's bedroom?
she's going to be well?
karl , if you put this in regan's bedroom , i want you to tell me .
now , did you?
no , not me .
i didn't .
this was under regan's pillow .
did you put it there?
of course , i didn't .
i didn't put it .
excuse me , madam .
what?
a man to see you .
what man?
you're a very nice lady .
thank you .
you're a nice man .
i'll come back when she's feeling better .
no , she was heavily sedated .
it's serious?
yes , i'm afraid it is .
may i ask ...?
we still don't know .
watch out for drafts .
a draft in the fall , when the house is hot , is ... ... a magic carpet for bacteria .
excuse me , madam .
anything else?
no , karl , we're fine .
thank you .
it's all right .
why are you asking all this?
it's strange .
the deceased comes to visit , stays only 20 minutes ... ... and leaves all alone a very sick girl .
and speaking plainly , mrs. macneil ... ... it isn't likely he would fall from a window .
besides , a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found .
except maybe one chance in a thousand .
no .
my hunch ....
my opinion ... ... he was killed by a very powerful man : point one .
and the fracturing of his skull : point two ... ... plus the various other things we mentioned ... ... would make it very probable ... ... probable , not certain ... ... that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window .
but nobody was in the room except your daughter , so how can this be?
it could be one way .
if someone came calling between the time miss spencer left ... ... and the time you returned .
judas priest , just a second .
the servants?
they have visitors?
not at all .
you were expecting a package that day , some delivery?
not that i know of .
groceries , cleaning ... a package?
i really wouldn't know .
karl takes care of all that .
i see .
would you like to ask him?
no , never mind , it's ... ... it's very remote .
no , never mind .
would you like some more coffee?
please .
that's cute .
your daughter , she's the artist?
thank you .
incidentally ... ... you might ask your daughter ... ... if she remembers seeing mr. dennings in her room that night .
look , he wouldn't have any reason in the world to go up to her room .
i know , i realize , but ... ... if certain british doctors never asked , " what is this fungus? " ... ... we wouldn't today have penicillin .
correct?
when she's better , i'll ask her .
it couldn't hurt .
in the meantime ....
that's okay .
i really hate to ask you this , but ... ... for my daughter , could you please give an autograph?
of course .
where's a pencil?
right here .
she'd love it !
what's her name?
i lied .
it's for me .
kinderman .
you know that film you made , angel?
i saw that six times !
really?
it was beautiful .
thank you .
'bye .
'bye .
please , no !
do it !
please , don't !
you bitch !
do it !
please , no !
let jesus fuck you !
let jesus fuck you !
give it !
give it to me !
lick me !
lick me !
mrs. macneil , open the door !
do you know what she did , your cunting daughter?
chris macneil?
please go away .
i'm father karras .
i'm very sorry .
hello .
i should have told you i wouldn't be in uniform .
yeah , that would have helped .
have you got a cigarette , father?
thanks .
cold .
how did a shrink ever get to be a priest?
it's the other way around .
the society sent me through medical school .
where?
harvard , bellevue ... ... johns hopkins .
places like that .
you're a friend of father dyer's , right?
yes , i am .
pretty close?
pretty close .
did he talk to you about my party?
he sure did .
about my daughter?
no , i didn't know you had one .
he didn't mention her?
no .
he didn't tell you what she did?
he didn't mention her .
priests are pretty tight mouthed then?
that depends .
on what?
the priest .
i mean , what if a person ... ... came to you , you know , that was a murderer or a criminal of some kind ... ... and they wanted some kind of help?
would you have to turn them in?
well , if he came to me for spiritual advice , i'd say no .
you wouldn't?
no , i wouldn't .
but i would try to convince him to turn himself in .
and , how do you go about getting an exorcism?
i beg your pardon?
if a person's , you know , possessed by a demon , or something ... ... how do they get an exorcism?
first , i'd have to get them into a time machine ... ... and get them back to the 1 6th century .
i didn't get you .
it just doesn't happen anymore , mrs. macneil .
oh , yes?
since when?
since we learned about mental illness , paranoia , schizophrenia .
all those things they taught me at harvard .
mrs. macneil , since the day i joined the jesuits ... ... i've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism .
not one .
yeah , well ... ... it just so happens that somebody very close to me ... ... is probably possessed .
and needs an exorcist .
father karras , it's my little girl .
then that's all the more reason to forget about exorcism .
why?
i don't understand .
to begin with , it could make things worse .
how?
secondly , the church , before it approves an exorcism ... ... conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted .
that takes time .
you could do it yourself .
no , i couldn't .
i'd need church approval , and that's rarely given .
could you see her?
yes , i could .
i could see her as a psychiatrist
not a psychiatrist !
she needs a priest !
she's seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world ... ... and they sent me to you !
are you gonna send me back to them?
jesus christ , won't somebody help me?
you don't understand
can't you help her?
just help her !
it wants no straps .
hello , regan .
i'm a friend of your mother's .
i'd like to help you .
you might loosen these straps , then .
i'm afraid you might hurt yourself , regan .
i'm not regan .
i see .
well , then , let's introduce ourselves .
i'm damien karras .
and i am the devil .
now kindly undo these straps .
if you're the devil , why not make the straps disappear?
that's much too vulgar a display of power , karras .
where's regan?
in here , with us .
show me regan and i'll loosen one of the straps .
could you help an old altar boy , father?
your mother is in here with us , karras .
would you like to leave a message?
i il see that she gets it .
if that's true ... ... then you must know my mother's maiden name .
what is it?
what is it?
hello , daddy?
this is me .
thank you .
look , i'm only against the possibility of doing her more harm than good .
nothing you could do could make it any worse .
i can't do it .
i need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession .
like what?
her speaking in a language she's never known or studied .
what else?
i don't know .
i'd have to look it up .
i thought you were supposed to be an expert .
there are no experts .
you probably know as much about possession as most priests .
your daughter doesn't say she's a demon .
she says she's the devil himself .
if you've seen as many psychotics as i have , you'd realize ... ... that's the same as saying you're napoleon bonaparte .
you asked me what i think is best for your daughter .
six months under observation ... ... in the best hospital you can find .
you show me regan's double ... ... same face , same voice , everything ... ... and i'd know it wasn't regan .
i'd know in my gut .
i'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter .
i want you to tell me that you know for a fact ... ... there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind !
tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good !
you tell me that !
did regan know a priest was coming over?
no .
did you know my mother died recently?
yes , i did .
i'm very sorry .
is regan aware of it?
not at all .
why do you ask?
it's not important .
good night .
you know , i'm like in seclusion .
no , i'm just exhausted from work .
what should i say anyway?
just talk to your daddy .
tell him what you've been doing and how you're feeling .
i hope you can hear me .
can you hear me okay?
he's not going to answer you .
talk to your daddy , honey .
i don't know what to say .
well , let's see .
first we ....
no ....
wait .
i don't know .
tell him about washington .
okay .
you see , we're in washington now , daddy , and ....
'take this , all of you , and eat it .
'for this is my body . '
when the supper was ended , he took the cup .
again he gave you thanks and praise .
'take this ...
'... all of you , and drink from it .
'this is the cup of my blood .
'the blood of the new and everlasting covenant , the mystery of faith . " '
what an excellent day for an exorcism .
you'd like that?
intensely .
but wouldn't that drive you out of regan?
it would bring us together .
you and regan?
you and us .
did you do that?
do it again .
in time .
no , now .
in time .
mirabile dictu , don't you agree?
you speak latin?
ego te absolvo .
quod nomen mihi est?
bonjour !
quod nomen mihi est?
la plume de ma tante .
how long are you planning to stay in regan?
until she rots and lies stinking in the earth .
what's that?
holy water .
you keep it away !
it burns !
oh , it burns !
who are you?
no one .
who are you?
she's , she's all right .
i don't want to talk about it , okay?
okay , i'll talk to you .
i'll call as soon as it's over , all right?
no , i just , i'm going through something and i just have to ....
no , no ....
there's nothing .
hey , thanks a lot .
want a drink?
please .
what do you drink?
scotch .
ice and water .
no ice .
i'll get some from the kitchen .
that's all right .
i'll take it straight .
please sit .
where's her father?
in europe .
have you told him what's happening?
no .
well , i think you should .
i told regan that was holy water .
i sprinkled it on her and she reacted very violently .
it's tap water .
what's the difference?
holy water is blessed .
and that doesn't help support a case for possession .
she killed burke dennings .
what?
she killed burke dennings .
she pushed him out her window .
no one !
it's a language , all right .
it's english .
what do you mean?
it's english in reverse .
listen .
give us time .
let her die .
i am no one .
i am no one .
fear the priest .
fear the priest .
merrin !
i am no one .
merrin !
fear the priest !
merrin !
yeah?
i'll be right there .
i don't want chris to see this .
what's wrong?
what is it?
father?
you're convinced that it's genuine?
i don't know .
no , not really , i suppose .
but i have made ... ... a prudent judgment that it meets the conditions set down in the ritual .
you would want to do the exorcism yourself?
yes .
it might be best to have a man with experience .
someone who's spent time in the foreign missions .
i understand , your excellency .
let's see who's around .
in the meantime , i'll call you as soon as i know .
thank you , your excellency .
well , he does know the background .
i doubt there's any danger in just having him assist .
there should be a psychiatrist present , anyway .
what about the exorcist?
have you any ideas?
how about lankester merrin?
i had a notion he was in iraq .
i read he was working on a dig near nineveh .
you're right , but he's finished .
he came back three or four months ago .
he's at woodstock now .
what's he doing there , teaching?
he's working on another book .
don't you think he's too old , tom?
how's his health?
he must be all right .
he's still running around digging up tombs .
besides , he's had experience .
i didn't know that .
ten , 1 2 years ago , i think , in africa .
the exorcism supposedly lasted months .
i heard it damn near killed him .
especially important is the warning to avoid conversations with the demon .
we may ask what is relevant , but anything beyond that is dangerous .
he's a liar .
the demon is a liar .
you're mrs. macneil?
yes .
i'm father merrin .
come in .
thank you .
is father karras here?
yes .
he's here already .
it's an honor to meet you , father .
are you very tired?
no .
i'd like you to go quickly across to the residence ... ... and gather up a cassock for myself ... ... two surplices , a purple stole , and some holy water ... ... and ... ... your copy of the roman ritual .
the large one .
i believe we should begin .
do you want to hear the background of the case first , father?
why?
thank you .
thank you very much .
you're welcome .
would you like some brandy in that , father?
the doctors say i shouldn't .
but thank god ... ... my will is weak .
he will lie to confuse us .
but he will also mix lies with the truth ... ... to attack us .
the attack is psychological , damien .
and powerful .
so don't listen .
remember that .
do not listen !
it might be helpful if i gave you some background ... ... on the different personalities regan has manifested .
so far , i'd say there seem to be three .
she's convinced that  there is only one .
what is your daughter's middle name , mrs. macneil?
teresa .
what a lovely name .
i command you ...
... by the judge of the living and the dead ...
... to depart from this servant of god !
it's the power ....
stick your cock up her ass , you mother fucking worthless cock sucker !
be silent !
our father , who art in heaven ... " ... hallowed be thy name .
thy kingdom come .
thy will be done ...
... on earth as it is in heaven .
give us this day our daily bread .
forgive us our trespasses ...
... as we forgive those who trespass against us .
and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from the evil one .
save me , o god , by thy name .
by thy might , defend my cause .
proud men have risen up against me , and men of violence seek my life ...
... but god is my helper and the lord sustains my life .
in every need he has delivered me .
glory be to the father , to the son and to the holy spirit .
as it was in the beginning , is now and ever shall be , world without end .
" save your servant ...
" ... who places her trust in thee .
be unto her , o lord , a fortified tower .
in the face of the enemy ...
... let the enemy have no power over her .
and the son of iniquity be powerless to harm her .
your mother sucks cocks in hell , karras !
you faithless slime !
the lord be with you .
" and also with you .
" let us pray .
holy lord , almighty father , everlasting god ...
... and father of our lord , jesus christ ...
... who , once and for all , consigned that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell ...
... who sent your only begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion ...
... hasten to our call for help ...
... and snatch from ruination ...
... and from the clutches of the noon day devil ...
... this human being , made in your image and likeness .
strike terror , lord , into the beast ...
... now laying waste to your vineyard .
let your mighty hand cast him out of your servant , regan teresa macneil ... " ... so he may no longer hold captive this person ...
... whom it pleased you to make in your image ... " ... and to redeem through your son , who lives and reigns with you ...
... in the unity of the holy spirit , god , forever and ever .
" amen .
" o lord , hear my prayer .
father karras .
damien .
the response , please , damien !
and let my cry come unto thee .
almighty lord , word of god the father , jesus christ ...
... god and lord of all creation ...
... who gave to your holy apostles ...
... the power to tramp underfoot serpents and scorpions .
grant me ...
... your unworthy servant ...
... pardon for all my sins ...
... and the power to confront this cruel demon .
see the cross of the lord .
be gone , you hostile power .
o lord , hear my prayer .
" the lord be with you .
" and also with you .
i cast you out , unclean spirit !
shove it up your ass , you faggot !
" in the name of our lord , jesus christ !
it is he who commands you !
he who flung you from the heights of heaven to the depths of hell !
fuck him !
" be gone ...
... from this creature of god !
be gone !
in the name of the father , and of the son ... " ... and of the holy spirit .
by this sign of the holy cross , of our lord jesus christ ... " ... who lives and reigns with the father and the holy spirit .
damien !
amen .
god , defender of the human race ... " ... look down in pity
you killed your mother !
you left her alone to die !
shut up !
she'll never forgive you !
shut up !
why this girl?
it doesn't make sense .
holy water !
it's the power of christ that compels you !
the power of christ compels you !
the power of christ compels you !
the power of christ compels you !
he brought you low by his blood stained cross !
do not despise my command because you know me to be a sinner .
it is god himself who commands you !
the majestic christ who commands you !
god , the father , commands you !
god , the son , who commands you !
god , the holy spirit , who commands you !
the mystery of the cross commands you !
the blood of the martyrs commands you !
give way to christ , you prince of murderers !
you're guilty before almighty god .
guilty before his son .
guilty before the whole human race .
it is the lord who expels you ...
... he , who is coming to judge both the living and the dead ...
... and the world , by fire .
are you tired?
let's rest before we start again .
i think the point is to make us despair .
to see ourselves as ... ... animal and ugly .
to reject the possibility that god could love us .
will you excuse me , damien?
dimmy , why do you do this to me?
please , dimmy .
i'm afraid .
you're not my mother .
dimmy , please !
what is it?
her heart .
can you give her something?
she'll go into a coma .
you're not my mother !
don't listen .
why , dimmy?
damien !
dimmy , please !
get out .
you son of a bitch !
take me !
our father ...
... who art in heaven , hallowed be thy name ....
is it over?
is she going to die?
no .
come in to me !
goddamn you , take me !
take me !
no !
mother .
mother .
mother .
did somebody fall?
he fell from the steps here !
rags?
do you want to make your confession?
are you sorry ... ... are you sorry for having offended god and for all the sins of your past life?
ego te absolvo in nomine patris ... " ... et filii , et spiritus sancti .
amen .
where do you want this?
what is it?
phonograph .
storage .
that's everything .
i'm going to miss you .
same here .
sure you won't change your mind?
i found this in her room .
you better hurry .

she doesn't remember any of it .
