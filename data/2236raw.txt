you were very good to us .
it was an honour serving you , sir .
i want to seek out my own kind .
in order to understand my destiny , i must know if there is another like myself .
north am robotics will not return my inquiries .
now that you've finally passed the bar , lloyd ... ... i want you to sue them for information of the whereabouts of all ndr robots .
if you don't mind .
the freedom of information act doesn't quite cover suits by robots .
not yet .
mother , i'm a very busy man .
i do not have time to help it ... ... pursue some ridiculous lawsuit .
lloyd , sweetheart , i do love you .
but sometimes i have to wonder if you really are my child .
well , that's mutation , mother .
i'm not you .
you've always been more like your father .
so that's why you divorced him .
sorry .
what would you do if i got the information on these other ndrs?
i would seek them out .
each and every one .
so you'd be gone for quite a long time .
yes .
several years , if not more , if my calculations are correct .
i'd love to help you .
did he not breast feed?
my journey is nearing the end of its tenth year .
i still have not found any robot that bears any similarity to myself .
i have thousands of miles to go , hundreds of cities to visit ...
... so i have not given up hope .
love , andrew .
hello .
my last name is martin .
get off the field .
my journey is nearing its end .
i've exhausted all possibilities save for one final ray of hope .
i've learned of an ndr robot that has recently been rebuilt ...
... back home in san francisco .
thank you .
you're quite welcome .
is this yours?
thank you .
i'm looking for rupert burns .
you've come to the right place .
come in .
certainly have .
do you have a name?
of course i do .
galatea .
galatea .
you have an amazing agility .
you were dancing in the market .
did you like that?
very much .
dancing is the sportiest sport .
and we're so much better at it than humans .
i can't believe i finally found you .
when did you know?
know what?
that you were unique?
i knew that right away .
me , too .
you and i , we're the same .
we have personality .
is your personality chip turned on?
isn't yours?
no .
sucks to be you !
i think personality is much more fun than intelligence .
don't you?
i think so .
can i help you?
your robot is just a standard ndr , isn't she?
yeah , i'm afraid so .
why does she have the ability to dance?
because i put a modified skeletal chip into her during her rebuild .
how did you do the modification?
my father taught me .
he created the android unit at north am robotics .
he created the technology that allows you to mimic human expression .
what happened to him?
north am laid him off , so we started this place .
i took over when he died .
i'm sorry to hear that .
he would've been absolutely thrilled to meet you .
i'm rupert burns .
it's a real honour .
the honour is mine .
you and i , we're the same !
let's get loco , robo !
shut her off , or i will !
thank you .
is this your father's work?
yeah .
it's our work , you could say .
i haven't been able to restrain myself from continuing to tinker with ... ... the relentlessly unfashionable android technology .
as a matter of fact , i've actually gotten to a point ... ... where i can pretty much exactly replicate the external physical appearance ... ... of a human being .
remarkable .
thank you .
amazing !
unfortunately , nobody seems terribly interested in funding my research , but
i am .
i will fund your research .
yeah?
that'd be cool .
thank you , darling .
i want to make it very clear this is an external physical upgrade only .
strictly speaking , you'll feel nothing .
none of your internal mechanisms will be changed .
you'll be subject to your positronic brain .
is that clear?
understood .
now , have you given any thought whatsoever ... ... as to what age you'd like to be?
officially , i am 62 years old .
let's take off 25 years .
15 .
20 .
perfect .
believe it or not , the secret to all this is actually imperfection .
imperfection?
things like wrinkles , less than perfect teeth .
details like fading scars , little pockmarks .
look at my nose .
see my nose?
it's bulbous and slightly irregular .
it is .
i'm the only one who has my nose .
that's what makes me me .
we must incorporate these features into your design so that you can be ... ... the only one of you .
that's what makes us unique is those imperfections .
i see .
like the shape of your head .
what about the shape of my head?
it's huge .
but lovely .
thank you .
what happened?
what's going on?
what happened?
i saw the inner me .
is it ready?
please be careful .
don't drop me .
i'm being careful .
oh , my god !
just relax .
relax .
why did you do that?
that wasn't very funny .
just keeping you on your toes .
i don't have any toes .
you do now .
i do .
and hands .
and fingers !
how do i look?
see for yourself .
thank you .
beautiful .
sorry .
who are you?
andrew .
andrew?
you look wonderful .
even younger .
how do you do that?
do i know you?
i know i look different , too .
i've had an upgrade .
touch it .
sorry .
the face .
what's going on?
you leave her alone !
who are you?
andrew .
no .
andrew?
but andrew's a robot .
yes , i am .
well , now an android .
he's had an upgrade .
i know that .
hello .
hello .
it is you !
you know him?
yes .
you know me?
who're you?
i'm little miss .
that's little miss .
no .
no .
that's portia .
portia?
who's portia?
my granddaughter .
your granddaughter?
is this some kind of trick?
you're little miss?
then what right do you have to look like her?
there is and can be only one little miss .
really?
it's a genetic resemblance .
sometimes it skips a generation .
i don't care .
i don't like it .
i can see that .
if you took a moment , which i see you're not inclined to do ... ... you'd realise portia and i are very different people .
why is she imitating you?
what's so funny?
you are .
i'm not trying to be funny .
things have certainly changed around here .
that happens after 20 years .
i have so much to tell you .
come with me .
it is you .
yes .
hello , my friend .
hello , little miss .
whose daughter is she?
lloyd's .
now the rudeness makes sense .
go home to your master .
you don't have a home , do you?
i don't have food .
i don't eat .
come in .
we'll keep each other company .
i know you don't like me .
i don't like you either .
i just want to make that clear .
couldn't be more clear if you spat in my face .
i can't .
i don't have a mucous gland .
would it be possible to have a slightly longer conversation?
may my canine companion enter also?
thank you .
is this your sculpture?
no , i'm restoring it .
i'm a preservation architect .
it's quite horrendous .
how ugly was it before you restored it?
first you get mad at me because of how i look .
now you show up at my door , announce that you don't like me ... ... and then you criticise my work .
once again , i apologise for telling the truth but it can't be helped .
it's my programming .
what is it exactly that you want?
family .
my last name is martin .
i'm so named because your great grandfather and grandmother ... ... considered me to be a member of your family .
now sir is dead .
little miss is getting older .
you don't like me , but you'll talk to me if i knock on your door long enough .
is that a joke?
no .
would you like to hear a joke?
this buddhist says to a hot dog vendor , " make me one with everything .
andrew , do you have any friends at all?
no .
only woofy , who's very sweet , but not challenging on a conversational level .
that is the extent of his skills .
so you want someone to talk to?
with .
even if that person doesn't like you?
you can't have everything .
is that right?
is it , " you can have everything "?
some people do , so i'm somewhat confused on that level .
sit down .
let's talk .
thank you .
hey there , handsome .
could i get you anything to drink?
i'm sorry .
i have no stomach .
could i get something for him?
he has a stomach , yes .
how is she?
she's sleeping .
what happened?
she had a stroke .
there you are .
little miss .
she's gone .
it's cruel that you can cry and i cannot .
there is a terrible pain i cannot express .
will every human being that i care for ... ... just leave?
i'm afraid so .
that won't do .
this is remarkably impressive .
you did this all by yourself?
yes .
i downloaded every known medical textbook into my memory .
i studied them .
that's how i came up with these drawings .
i know they're primitive and not complete .
i need you to fill in the mechanical gaps .
this is another upgrade .
it's considerably more than an upgrade .
you're talking about a profound transition ... ... from the mechanical to the biological .
i realise that .
i believe it is the ideal marriage of both fields .
not only that , but this stuff could cut both ways .
i don't think that any existing prosthetic devices hold a candle ... ... to what you've designed here .
i mean , you could use these in human beings as well .
exactly .
what a piece of faecal matter .
shit .
excuse me?
what a piece of shit .
i know that .
when you're frustrated you say , " piece of shit .
piece of shit .
yes , but with feeling .
what a piece of shit .
more .
what a piece of shit !
good , very good .
are you aware that what you've essentially designed here ... ... is a human central nervous system?
that was my intention , yes .
well , you got to realise that a nervous system will radically enhance ... ... the way you feel and perceive the world around you .
i'm not just talking about hot and cold and little tiny pinpricks .
put it this way .
as your experience becomes varied ... ... so will the feelings , emotions , sensations stimulated by that experience .
and , while some of these will be very subtle ... ... and wonderful , and nuanced , and shaded ... ... others will be profoundly intense and difficult to tolerate .
do you feel like you're ready for that?
absolutely .
lovely .
thank you .
i was referring to the statue .
i know .
could you fix this piece of shit?
i don't know .
let me take a look .
andrew , i'm sure you could restore this yourself .
yes , i could ... ... but you could do it much better .
i'd be happy to fix it for you .
lf it's not too much effort .
no , not at all .
i've been working all day and i could use some air .
do you want to go for a walk?
that would be quite splendid .
yes .
why are you laughing at me?
you're always so polite and so proper .
it's very sweet .
thank you .
let's go .
thank you .
when a man's an empty kettle he should be on his mettle
and yet i'm torn apart
it's because i'm presumin 'that i could be kinda human
if i only had a heart
" picture me a balcony ....
do you have an impact drill?
over on the rack .
thank you .
jesus !
there's a party next week to celebrate the opening of a building that i restored .
all my friends will be there .
it would be great if you could come .
i would love to .
thank you .
i think you're letting me win .
checkmate .
charles , why don't you go get us a drink?
thank you .
i never understood the phrase , " pearls before swans .
what?
" swine .
then the ballet is not " swine lake .
oh , god .
nobody makes me laugh like you .
laughter is essential for a good friendship .
yes , it is .
sometimes i get the feeling that ... ... you feel a certain way about us ... ... and that you wish your ....
what?
i don't know .
it's just a little ....
having this conversation with ....
a robot?
yes .
i mean , a thing is itself , andrew .
a tree is a tree .
water is water .
you are a magnificent machine .
no matter how much you change , that's what you'll always be .
no .
i can't believe that , will not believe that .
i realise i am not entirely human .
that's why people don't always like or understand me .
i like you .
you do?
i even understand you some of the time .
but i can't invest my emotions in a machine .
it must be a genetic trait .
things change , portia .
things always change .
she laughed at me .
a thing is itself , andrew .
water is water .
what about ice?
what about steam?
andy , you got to calm down .
do you know what it's like to be laughed at?
humiliating .
it's an abomination .
look at me .
look what i'm doing here .
i'm trying to make something of myself .
i'm trying to fulfil my destiny .
does she notice?
i don't want you to take this personally , but i have to work now .
good night .
where have you been?
i've been trying to call you .
poke me in the eye .
what?
poke me in the eye !
you're crazy .
poke me in the eye !
that hurts !
it works !
what the hell's going on?
it's my neural net !
i'm the proud owner of a nervous system .
you can feel .
yes , very much !
do something for me?
perform an experiment for the sake of science .
all right .
kiss me .
no , not there .
here .
thank you .
could you feel it?
it's wonderful .
it's everything they say it is .
and you?
what's wrong?
charles and i are getting married .
he's a lucky man .
congratulations to the both of you .
goddamn it , andrew !
if you're going to succeed at this thing you're trying to do ... ... you've got to stop being so damn deferential .
i can't help being deferential .
it's built in .
then change .
change?
i have changed .
i don't mean on the outside .
change on the inside .
take chances , make mistakes .
sometimes it's important not to be perfect .
it's important to do the wrong thing !
do the wrong thing?
yes .
why?
i see .
to learn from your mistakes .
no .
to make them !
to find out what's real and what's not , to find out what you feel .
human beings are terrible messes .
i'll grant you that .
i see .
this is what is known as an irrational conversation , isn't it?
this is a human conversation .
it's not about being rational .
it's about following your heart .
and that's what i should do?
yes .
and you have a heart , andrew .
i feel it .
i don't even believe it sometimes , but i do feel it .
and in order to follow that heart ...
... one must do the wrong thing .
yes .
thank you .
could you be a little more careful?
that's very delicate equipment .
sorry !
what are you doing?
near as i can tell , your bitch work !
my what?
you heard me , and i'm sick of it !
all day long it's , " yes , rupert , sir , " " no , rupert , sir .
would you like another beverage , rupert , sir? " and it chaps my ass !
so here's a helpful hint for you .
shut up , and let me do my work !
i'm done .
chaps my ass "?
where's the chip?
i replaced it .
she's uncooperative , abusive , confrontational
and a lot more interesting .
arguably , but we're not getting any work done .
please give me the old personality chip back .
fine .
she can be perky again .
perky "?
she's just a robot
i didn't mean it that way .
i really didn't mean that .
what's the matter with you today?
where are you going?
aunt jamie , i want you too meet charles .
this is my aunt jamie .
nice to meet you .
what's going on?
portia's parents are giving an engagement party ... ... that i wasn't invited to for obvious reasons .
there he is .
who?
the prospective groom .
where?
where?
the one in the pale blue suit with the big pointy chin !
he's got a pointy chin?
you can put an eye out with that chin !
that's nothing compared to his teeth .
look at that !
i'm amazed he's out in daylight .
yeah , he's got funny teeth .
you need to upgrade your eyes .
that shouldn't stop portia .
she can marry whoever she likes .
one day she'll wake up and realise she's married to a man ... ... whose face closely resembles an antique can opener .
the kind that used to go ....
the ones that move around , and the can pops off .
you're jealous .
no , i'm not !
you're jealous !
you are .
otherwise , what're you doing spying on portia?
my god , i am jealous .
if i'm jealous , that means i'm in love .
if i'm in love , then all hope is gone .
i've lost her .
would you like a sip of my beer?
it'd be a waste .
i could not taste it .
what if you could?
that would be exquisite .
i've come up with a design , or a modification rather ... ... that if i'm correct , would enable you to deal with solid foods and liquids .
and taste?
taste , too .
and also , if my schematics are correct ... ... i think i've come up with a method to make you a complete man .
complete?
complete .
complete?
not in a reproductive sense , of course , but in terms of approximating ... ... the physical sensation , you know , that occurs ...
... friction .
sexual relations?
i've always been fascinated by that .
i mean , curious .
because of what they say .
what do they say?
that you can lose yourself .
everything .
all boundaries , all time .
that two bodies can become so mixed up ... ... that you don't know who's who or what's what .
and just when the sweet confusion is so intense you think you'll die ... ... you kind of do , leaving you alone in your separate body .
but the one you love is still there .
that's a miracle .
you can go to heaven and come back alive .
go back , anytime you want with the one you love .
and you want to experience that?
yes , please .
so do i.
excuse me .
i'll be right back .
i didn't expect to see you .
i remember this place very well .
this is where your grandmother was married .
i wanted it ready for my own wedding .
so you're not married yet?
no , two weeks from saturday .
i'm not too late .
are you positive you're doing the right thing?
positive .
about getting married?
i'm never positive about anything .
you could be doing the wrong thing .
i'm pretty sure i'm doing the right thing .
great .
why is that great?
you told me to do the wrong thing .
you aren't doing the wrong thing , you're doing the right thing .
you're not following your own advice , 'cause if you were you wouldn't marry him .
because i would be doing the right thing .
precisely .
in some strange way , you're starting to make sense .
good .
you know what it's like to be in love with someone who's marrying someone else?
someone who's magnificent?
someone who walks into a room and lights it up like the sun?
someone who you know is lying to herself?
lying?
convincingly .
very much so .
about what?
that you don't love me when i know , at least in some way , you do .
and how do you know that?
i have done everything , inside and out .
that stuff doesn't matter to me .
something matters .
if nothing mattered , you'd love me ... ... and not some man whose chin could sink the titanic .
what?
see?
it's true , isn't it?
sorry .
does he light you up like this?
does he make you laugh?
nobody makes me laugh like this .
good .
then admit it .
admit that you love me .
give me one kiss .
that's all .
one quick kiss .
just one kiss could not jeopardise a glorious marriage .
it would also explain why your pulse just jumped from 66 to 102 beats per minute .
your respiration is doubled .
you're putting out clouds of pheromones .
it's not fair to read me like that .
i know .
love isn't fair .
i'm reading your heart .
i'm asking you to follow it .
begging you .
begging is supposed to be humiliating .
i don't care .
i love you , portia .
i loved you the very first moment i saw you .
i thought you said a quick kiss .
i lied !
how do you feel?
wonderful .
so do i.
i guess that's the point .
what was that?
it's your stomach growling .
you're hungry .
was that me?
yes .
i thought it was you .
no , it wasn't me .
really?
do you do that?
sometimes , but quieter than that .
i'll have to have rupert make me a muffler .
it's wonderful .
it's wonderful , the taste and the texture both .
it's marvellous .
i know this will be my fourth helping , but may i please have some more?
pig .
very smart animal .
obviously not that smart if it ends up as bacon .
i feel like i'm eating my way through the entire food chain .
thank you .
what?
what's wrong?
if we're together ... ... you and me , we'll never be accepted .
because i'm not human .
that will not do .
i will have to get started .
started with what?
the next step .
i love you .
wish me luck .
andrew martin .
step forward , please .
so , mr. martin ... ... you would like us to pass a bill declaring you a human being .
yes .
specifically , the ability to marry a fellow human being .
i see .
we have to face the undeniable fact ... ... that no matter how much you may be like a human being ... ... you are not part of the human gene pool .
you are outside of it entirely .
you are something else .
something artificial .
sir , what about all the real people wading in the gene pool ... ... who are full of prosthetic devices , many of which i have invented?
you yourself , sir , have one of my kidneys , do you not?
are you not in some way artificial , at least in part?
in part , yes .
then i'm human , in part .
which part , andrew?
this one , sir .
i see .
and here?
it is true , i am still equipped with a positronic brain .
and because of that positronic brain you are , for all accounts , immortal .
yes , sir .
andrew , society can tolerate an immortal robot ... ... but we will never tolerate an immortal human .
it arouses too much jealousy , too much anger .
i'm sorry , andrew .
this court cannot and will not validate your humanity .
i hereby bring an end to these proceedings .
it is the decision of this court that andrew martin , from this day forward ... ... will continue to be declared a robot .
a mechanical machine , nothing more .
one is glad to be of service .
andrew , i have to tell you ... ... l'm beginning to feel not so sure .
about us?
no .
next week will be my 75th birthday
i know , and you look 50 .
thank you .
a spectacular 50 .
but i don't feel 50 .
your body does .
last night was amazing .
what was that called again?
shut up and listen to me !
sorry .
don't give me that look , i'm not ordering you around .
whatever you say .
don't be agreeable .
i'm not being agreeable .
i can be if you want me to .
goddamn it !
i'm trying to tell you something important here .
i'm not going to live forever .
yes , you will .
that's why i invented all  no , no .
i won't always take your dna elixirs .
i won't have all my organs replaced .
eventually , i'm going to wear out .
and i want to .
why would you want to leave?
there's an order to things .
human beings are meant to be here for a certain time and then pass on .
that's what's right .
i see .
there's just one problem , portia .
i couldn't stand to live without you .
andrew , people grow through time .
but then , for you , time is a completely different proposition .
for you , time is endless .
there is only one thing to do .
galatea , my dear , where are we?
the transfusion is almost complete .
is that so?
just goes to show you , andrew .
somebody becomes a human being ... ... sooner or later , they do something monumentally stupid .
you've been a great example , rupert .
how quickly will the blood degrade my system?
i don't know .
you exercise , eat right , say , 30 , 40 years .
that's a little vague , chief .
you don't know exactly how long i'll last?
sorry .
welcome to the human condition .
andrew martin?
i've always tried to make sense of things .
there must be some reason i am as i am .
as you can see , madam chairman , i am no longer immortal .
you have arranged to die?
in a sense , i have .
i am growing old and my body is deteriorating .
and , like all of you , it'll eventually cease to function .
as a robot i could have lived forever .
but i tell you all today i would rather die a man ... ... than live for all eternity as a machine .
why do you want this?
to be acknowledged for who and what i am ... ... no more , no less ... ... not for acclaim , not for approval ... ... but the simple truth of that recognition .
this has been the elemental drive of my existence .
and it must be achieved ... ... if i am to live or die with dignity .
what you're asking for is ... ... extremely complex and controversial .
it will not be an easy decision .
i must ask for your patience ... ... while i take the necessary time to make a determination ... ... of this extremely delicate matter .
then i await your decision , madame chairman .
thank you for your patience .
we tried .
is it almost time?
in a few minutes .
it doesn't matter what the world congress says .
why do you need their approval?
old habit .
i started my existence as a robot .
i still like to be told certain things .
it's time .
ladies and gentlemen ... ... miss marjorie botha , president of the world congress .
according to records of the north am robotics company ... ... the robot , also known as andrew martin ... ... was powered up at 5 : 15 p . m . on april 3 , 2005 .
in a few hours , he will be 200 years old ... ... which means with the exception of methuselah and other biblical figures ... ... andrew is the oldest living human being in recorded history .
by this proclamation , i validate his marriage to portia charney ... ... and acknowledge his humanity .
i'm sorry he didn't see it .
maybe he didn't need to .
could you do me a favour?
would you mind unplugging me?
that's an order .
thank you , galatea .
one is glad to be of service .
see you soon .
