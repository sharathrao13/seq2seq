to joo rodrigues and maria joo " ivaro ...
ivaro !
ivaro !
she proceeded , all in white , led by her father , amid the murmur of the organ and the whispered voices .
she was sure she was smiling .
but inside her a cry was forming which had always been repressed and now , after 20 years , she still had it within herself .
clara !
what is she up to now?
ask jacinto to prepare the carriage .
i , ivaro rodrigues silvestre , tradesman and farmer from montouro ,
in the parish of so caetano , borough of corgos ,
do swear on my honour that i have continually stolen
from men on earth and god in heaven .
even when i was serving as the lady of montouro's butler ,
and maize for the poor was in excess
i filled my own granary with it .
in my defence i also swear that all i did was prompted
by d maria dos prazeres pessoa d'alba sancho silvestre ...
my wife .
" my wife ,
and that i never stopped stealing , at the counter , at the fairs ,
from the workers 'wages
and the inheritance of my brother , leopoldino , to whom i am the trustee
selling his lands without his knowledge ,
and who , to my shame , is now returning from africa
and i cannot give him the correct accounts .
my remission begins with this confession to the world .
may the father , the son and the holy ghost
have mercy upon me and anyone else who can do so .
the first page of the next issue .
i'll pay whatever you ask .
bu why this public confession?
i must settle my accounts with god and mankind .
above all with god .
what does your wife think about this?
she must never find out !
but , dear silvestre , she's bound to when the newspaper comes out .
i won't care then .
as they say ,
'in for a penny in for a pound '.
so , how much are you charging me?
damn , here she comes !
it seems i'm disturbing you .
aren't you going to introduce me?
maria dos prazeres pessoa d'alba sancho silvestre .
just imagine , he walked all the way , from montouro in this weather .
i don't know what brought him here .
whatever it was , he has been sick , having strange ideas and you must excuse him .
enough , maria !
let's go !
didn't dr. neto advise you to rest?
where are your boots?
i think i'm dreaming .
if it's daytime , then light is not enough to light a stony path .
it it's night , the stars shine with an unusual brightness .
on our way everything looks dead .
time is either tired of this long journey , or asleep , or it's also dead .
i have forgotten the familiar landscape .
and can only see a long , undulating desert , the fleshy and twisted silhouette of the cacti , the sharp pebbles in our path .
it is raining .
something like that .
jacinto , what is it?
indifferent , eh?
superior to the hardship he gives me , to the life he forces me to lead .
his excellency nods and sleeps , indifferent to what i say and to the world .
for twenty years i have been listening to his snoring ,
tiptoeing , so as not to waken him .
i may be wrong but i think the horse may be lame ...
don't worry .
keep going .
jacinto !
stop and see if the horse is lame !
well?
he is , it's what i said .
alright , alright .
go slowly , jacinto .
and even if they tell you to flay the horse , don't do it .
removing the last leg from one of these chickens that the natives sold me for the price of a cow and amazed by the sun's immense disc , diving at the end of the desert , suddenly , framed against the redness of the sunset ,
i saw a man on a mount .
he was unquestionably european , because he was wearing an overcoat .
the moment i saw him , the man swayed , fell down and started slowly crawling towards me .
in a desperate effort he straightened up , and staggered a few steps .
then he fell again and remained prostate , as though dead , against a tall tuft .
i shouted at one of my hunters to go and help him .
and when he came back , holding the man in his arms , whom do i see?
jos silveira .
or rather , his poor skeleton with the bones sticking out of the skin , which was drier than parchment and more yellow than egg yolk .
his eyes were aghast , like two blood clots , and his hair , formerly grey , was now completely white .
water , he moaned " .
water for the love of christ " .
ivaro .
ivaro .
what were you doing in corgos?
what paper was that you hid so quickly?
my dear ivaro .
here i am after six years in the inland .
africa is indescribable .
one has to come and see it .
where i was the natives were not bad people .
after being tamed , which , even so , was difficult ,
they came with me in my quest , for treasures , near solomon's mines .
in montouro we had a book on that which my sister in law bought .
the chief of the tribe gave me 30 natives , two elephants , luggage and two women for my personal use " .
don't read this part to my sister in law .
don't forget that a black woman when squeezed is juicier than an orange .
it is simply necessary to fill her with some of the spirit they have here .
i'd like to see a white woman who could match that .
why were you at the newspaper?
get off my back !
i will .
when you are less drunk .
who's drunk?
who?
you fucking aristocrat !
you only talk about coats of arms , but i've been feeding you for 20 years !
my father had a coachman who spoke like you .
and once he had no choice but to have him whipped .
if he were still alive , what wouldn't he do to you?
you're drunker and more vulgar than any coachman .
maria !
open the door , maria .
for god's sake , open the door .
i want to apologise .
it was the brandy talking , not me !
i know it was the brandy .
now leave me alone .
the coachmen are fed up !
god will spare you
from the burdens of this world
and the dangers abroad ...
and if we're found , jacinto?
don't worry .
it's still quite dark .
damn my old man and his wish of marrying me to a farmer .
look at the master .
he's not man enough for his wife .
he did't even dare to give her a son .
get off me !
come here !
jacinto !
the coachmen are fed up ...
everything's gone .
the damask covered chairs , the carved wardrobes , the sideboard with very fine crystal , the turned beds , the paintings on the walls , the silverware ...
everything's gone with our tears .
the jewellery , the rings .
everything's gone .
the rifles , the greyhounds , the horses , the carriages ... the old dagger studded with diamonds .
everthing is gone with our tears .
the time is approaching when my most precious of treasures will be stolen from me .
oh teresa , teresa .
thus will they separate us .
maybe forever .
i'd rather die a thousand deaths than endure this suffering .
entire nights go by with endless nightmares .
sometimes i see teresa crying , amidst the ghostly visions that torture my suffering soul .
i hear her sobs and anguished cries , torn from her bosom ...
oh teresa , teresa .
thus will they separate us .
maybe forever .
oh teresa , teresa .
thus will they separate us .
maybe forever .
oh teresa , teresa .
thus will they separate us .
maybe forever .
dragging teresa to a convent further away the hideous spectre of balthazar coutinho's cynicism , sneering at our love and preventing our happiness .
ah , but the villain will pay with his life for his wicked proceedings .
here come the tormentors of the innocent .
i can hear them .
i must hide .
may god protect me .
she was my only daughter , balthazar !
exactly .
if you had another , the loss would be less painful and her disobedience less dishonest .
now dear uncle ,
i see no other way than to put balm on the sore .
we'll get nowhere with plasters .
you're right .
uncle , she's coming .
teresa !
i am here .
it is not too late .
for what?
to be a good daughter .
my conscience bears no guilt ...
it's not over yet?
don't you want to go home , and forget this villain , who is the cause of our misfortunes?
no , father .
my fate is the convent .
i shall never forget him .
i shall be a disobedient daughter , but never a liar .
in that case , let's go .
not even here?
are you talking to me , teresa?
i am indeed !
not even here am i free from your hateful presence?
i am one of the servants that my cousin takes with her .
some days ago , there were two worthy of accompanying her .
but a murderer out there killed them .
i offer my services for lack of theirs .
i will do without your niceties .
but i will not do without serving you .
that's how it must be ...
the final accounts have not yet been made , my dear cousin .
simon .
it is incredible that this scoundrel should have come !
me , a scoundrel?
why?
scoundrel and murderer !
out of my sight !
i do not neglect your lordship .
dear lady , suffer with resignation as i do .
bear your misfortunes accepting the violence thereof .
and perhaps half way to your calvary , divine mercy will double your strength .
what is that villain saying? !
simon !
calm down , uncle !
he dares to comfort your daughter , vile though this act is .
it's too much .
i shall crush you right here , you villain .
the villain is he who threatens me without stepping one pace !
haven't i made that clear?
punishing you before the servants !
you are mere scum !
if that is so , i hope never to meet your lordship again .
such lack of dignity !
i shall surely have him beaten by the first rogue on the corner ...
ah , riff raff !
balthazar !
now the time has come .
the most precious of treasures will be stolen from me .
oh teresa , teresa .
thus will they separate us .
who knows?
maybe forever .
oh , i'd rather die a thousand deaths than endure this suffering .
entire nights go by in endless nightmares .
sometimes i see teresa tortured , seized by the same demons that haunt me .
i hear her sobs and anguished cries , torn from her bosom , asking heaven for deliverance from her torturers .
next to me , mariana's candid face begging , with joined hands .
further on , i see tadeu de albuquerque dragging teresa to a convent further away .
next to them , the hideous cynicism of balthazar , scorning at our love and preventing our happiness .
oh , clara ...
she slinks around , full of desire .
oh ana , oh ana , try to get me a man .
and she eats you with her eyes .
the hail mary's .
here come the tormentors of the innocent .
i can hear them .
i must hide and may god protect me .
a strike is being prepared , master antnio .
is it true that you love clara?
is it true that you love clara?
yes or no?
you know it's true , master .
what would you say if i offered her hand to you?
what would you say? !
i would say yes three times .
well , she's yours .
i have some accounts to settle .
she's yours if you help me settle them .
i like the pay .
you've found your man .
we'll run away .
it's a big world and one can live anywhere .
what about my father?
i'm afraid .
never mind that !
jacinto , i'm afraid .
who is that with her?
who is that with her?
i think it's jacinto , master .
silvestre's coachman?
i think so .
you think so , or you are sure?
it is him , master .
we must catch him .
go and get your club .
what are we going to do to him?
are you giving up already?
what will we do to jacinto?
do you want the girl , or not?
that's settled .
let's hide him and wait until dusk .
it's you groaning , master antnio?
like hell it is !
then it's him !
i never heard donkeys groan like that !
hit him again , marcelo !
finish him off !
catch the animal !
get him , he's taking our man !
catch the animal !
get him , he's taking our man !
grab him or we're lost !
i'll go after him , but i'm not coming back .
well then say goodbye to the girl !
marcelo , wait for me !
marcelo !
marcelo !!!
marcelo !
i'm back , master antnio .
so you are !
i knew you weren't a man to leave business unfinished .
can i have clara?
hit him again and we'll see .
get the club .
it's time to finish him off .
did you get him or not?
jacinto .
jacinto !
jacinto !
now you must give me clara , master antnio .
who knows?
you may have won her .
we must hurry , master , the sun is rising .
let it rise .
and as for the girl ...
you said you'd give her to me !
but i've been thinking .
do you know why we killed him?
because you said so .
good answer .
clara !
clara !
clara !
so , will you give her to me?
i think you have lost her .
clara !
marcelo !!
marcelo !
hail mary , full of grace , the lord be with you .
blessed be you among women .
blessed is the fruit of your womb , jesus .
hail mary , mother of god , beseech us poor sinners .
now and at the hour of our death , amen .
hail mary , full of grace , the lord be with you .
blessed be you among women .
blessed is the fruit of your womb , jesus .
hail mary , mother of god , beseech us poor sinners .
now and at the hour of our death , amen .
you must listen to me , maria ,
i may be killed and i don't want this on my conscience .
don't abandon me , don't leave me .
the coachman was boasting about the way you looked at him .
they are laughing about us and our life .
he was killed .
i went to the old man and told him his daughter and jacinto wanted to elope together and were flirting in the cow shed .
the old man went crazy .
i should have kept my mouth shut .
i should have kept my mouth shut .
don't worry , they won't kill you !
dreams about dreams .
always one mistake on top of another .
to forget you ... and our life .
shut up , for god's sake .
what i never imagined was that he realised it .
even now that he's dead , i hate that damned coachman .
if it's of any good to you , i hate him too ,
for having understood what was so much my own , so private that i didn't even admit it to myself .
now are you still surprised that i dream , ivaro?
did madame d'argres show up after all?
madame d'argres did show up and spoiled everything .
who invited madame d'argres?
no one .
the baron told her .
and she came to the woods , as if taking a stroll .
ccile , the knight de tellier and their friends were not too pleased .
but ccile's father invited her to stay for the picnic .
that marquis !
i always said he was an idiot .
the ruined marquis married madame d'argres .
of course , the knight could not become his own mistress 'son in law .
there's the desertion then .
do you understand , ccile?
the desertion .
love , as you have perhaps always wanted it .
the purity from cradle to death .
ccile , ccile ...
tresses unloosed over a trembling body .
someone's hands , as gentle as the rain in the fields .
but what does all that matter?
gracious me , didn't the knight do something?
yesterday , she and i cried in the last chapter .
the tears , the ever present radiance of the memory of armand .
the happiness of renunciation .
marriages of convenience .
madame d'argres and the marquis .
and armand ...
armand lost forever .
i learnt the last words by heart .
ccile's was too great a passion to be burned and consumed in common love .
armand tellier and she finally realised that .
and now , in the gentle renunciation ...
where is the brandy in this house?
in my defence i also swear that all i did was prompted
by maria dos prazeres pessoa d'alba sancho silvestre ,
my wife ,
and i never stopped stealing , at the counter , at the fairs ,
from the workers 'wages
and the inheritance of my brother , leopoldino , to whom i am the trustee
selling his lands without his knowledge
and who , to my shame , is now returning from africa .
we would also like to thank the facilities granted by
count bobone in all the outdoor shootings .
