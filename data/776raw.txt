i was right to idolize you .
i always knew you were tough , but tricking the probe by hiding under the bones of another super?

and then you had to just go and ruin the ride .
i mean , mr. incredible calling for help?
help me , help me .
lame , lame , lame .

contact?
what are you talking about?
i am referring to last night at 2307 hours while you were snooping around .
you sent out a homing signal .
i didn't know about the homing device .
and now a government plane is requesting permission to land here .
who did you contact?
i didn't send for a plane .

i've got baby sitting wired .
i've taken courses , learned cpr ,
excellent marks and certificates .
kari .
i brought mozart to play while he sleeps because leading experts say mozart makes babies smarter .
kari ...
the beauty is they don't have to listen 'cause they're asleep !
i wish my parents played mozart because half the time i don't know what anyone's talking about .
kari , i really don't feel comfortable with this .
i'll pay you for your trouble , but i'd rather call a service .
there's really no need , mrs. parr .
i can totally handle anything this baby can dish out .

i can handle it .
who can handle it?

i knew you couldn't do it .
even when you have nothing to lose .
you're weak .
and i've outgrown you .
those were short range missiles .
land based .
that way is our best bet .
you want to go toward the people that tried to kill us?
if it means land , yes .
do you expect us to swim there?
i expect you to trust me .
what a trooper .
i'm so proud of you .
thanks , mom .
i think your father is in trouble .
if you haven't noticed , we're not doing so hot either .
i'm going to look for him .
and that means you're in charge until i get back , violet .
what?
you heard her .
put these on .
your identity is your most valuable possession .
protect it .
and if anything goes wrong , use your powers .
but you said never to use ...
i know what i said !
remember the bad guys on those shows you used to watch on saturday mornings?
well , these guys are not like those guys .
they won't exercise restraint because you're children .
they will kill you if they get the chance .
do not give them that chance .
mom?
vi , i'm counting on you .
there's ...
i'm counting on you .
be strong .

i'm sorry .
i wanted to help .
when you asked me to ...
i'm sorry .
shh .
it isn't your fault .
it wasn't fair for me to suddenly ask so much of you .
but things are different now .
and doubt is a luxury we can't afford anymore , sweetie .
you have more power than you realize .
don't think .
and don't worry .
if the time comes , you'll know what to do .
it's in your blood .
he's not weak , you know .
what?
valuing life is not weakness .
hey .
look , if you're talking about what happened in the containment unit ,
i had everything under control .
and disregarding it is not strength .
i called his bluff , sweetheart , that's all .
i knew he wouldn't have it in him to actually ...
next time you gamble , bet your own life !
okay , okay , okay .
a rocket?
hey !
well , not that this isn't fun , but i'm gonna go look around .

they triggered the alert .
what?
security's in the jungle .

our kids are in danger?
if you suspected danger , why'd you bring them?
they stowed away .
you're not striking the proper tone .

uh oh .
i should've told you i was fired , i admit it .
but i didn't want you to worry .
you didn't want me to worry?
we're running for our lives through some godforsaken jungle .
you keep trying to pick a fight , but i'm just happy you're alive .
i know you're there , little miss disappear .
you can't hide from me .

what have we here?
matching uniforms?
oh , no !
elastigirl?
you married elastigirl?
whoa !
and got busy !
it's a whole family of supers .
looks like i've hit the jackpot !
oh , this is just too good !
the ship's unique design ...
there were no fatalities ...
huh?
huh?
oh , come on !
you gotta admit , this is cool .
just like a movie !
the robot will emerge dramatically , do some damage .
throngs of screaming people !
and just when all hope is lost , syndrome will save the day !
i'll be a bigger hero than you ever were !
you mean you killed off real heroes so that you could pretend to be one?
oh , i'm real .
real enough to defeat you !
and i did it without your precious gifts , your oh so special powers .
i'll give them heroics .
i'll give them the most spectacular heroics anyone's ever seen !
and when i'm old and i've had my fun , i'll sell my inventions so that everyone can be superheroes .
everyone can be super .
and when everyone's super ... ... no one will be .
fire at will !
it's overwhelming the tanks .
i'm sorry .
this is my fault .
i've been a lousy father .
blind to what i have .
so obsessed with being undervalued
that i undervalued all of you .
dad?
shh .
don't interrupt .
so caught up in the past that i ...
you are my greatest adventure .
and i almost missed it .
i swear , i'm gonna get us out of this safely if i ...
well , i think dad has made some excellent progress today but i think it's time we wind down now .
we need to get back to the mainland .
i saw an aircraft hangar on my way in .
straight ahead .
where are all the guards?
go , go !
hey , every time they run , you take a shot .
this is the right hangar , but i don't see any jets .
a jet's not fast enough .
what's faster than a jet?
how about a rocket?
great !
i can't fly a rocket .
you don't have to .
use the coordinates from the last launch .
wait .
i bet syndrome's changed the password by now .
how do i get into the computer?
say please .
honey?
what?
where is my supersuit?
what?
where is my supersuit?
i put it away .
where?
why do you need to know?
i need it !
don't you think about running off doing no derrin 'do .
we've been planning this dinner for two months !
the public is in danger !
my evening's in danger !
tell me where my suit is , woman !
we are talking about the greater good .
greater good "?

you're gonna miss it !
is everybody okay back there?
super duper , dad !
let's do that again .
wait here and stay hidden .
i'm going in .
while what?
i watch helplessly from the sidelines?
i don't think so .
i'm asking you to wait with the kids .
and i'm telling you not a chance .
you're my husband .
i'm with you for better or worse .
i have to do this alone .
what is this to you?
playtime?
no .
so you can be mr. incredible again?
no !
then what?
i'm not ...
not what?
i'm not strong enough .
this will make you stronger?
yes .
no !
that's what this is?
some sort of workout?
i can't lose you again !
i can't .
not again .
i'm not ... strong enough .
if we work together , you won't have to be .
i don't know what'll happen .
we're superheroes .
what can happen?
vi !
dash !
no !
violet?
dad !
go , go !
i'm okay , mom .

honey , take out its guns !
gotcha !
mom , i've got it !
i've got the remote !
a remote?
a remote that controls what?
the robot?
it's coming back !
that wasn't right .
give me that !
we can't stop it .
the only thing hard enough to penetrate it is ...
... itself .
it's getting closer !
it doesn't work !
kids !
it's not doing anything .
try to buy us some time .
try the one next to it .
honey !
wait a minute .

hang on !
what are you waiting for?
a closer target !
you got one shot !
everybody duck !
hey , zone .
huh?
no !

that's the way to do it .
that's old school .
yeah .
no school like the old school .
just like old times .
oh !
just like old times .
yeah .
hurt then too .
we've frozen all of syndrome's assets .
if he even sneezes , we'll be there with a hanky and a pair of handcuffs .
the people of this country are indebted to you .
does this mean we can come out of hiding?
let the politicians figure that one out .
i've been asked to assure you we'll take care of everything else .
you did good , bob .
hi , this is kari .
i have a question about jack jack ...
come on .
we're in a limo .
hey , you're wearing your hair back?
yeah , i just ... yeah .
it looks good .
thanks , dad .
that was cool when you threw that car !
not as cool as you running on water .
that was sweet when you snagged that bad guy with your arm and whiplashed him into the other guy .
sweet !
i'm trying to listen to messages .
it's me .
jack jack is fine , but weird things are happening .
jack jack's still fine , but i'm getting really weirded out !
when are you coming back? ... aced those guys that tried to kill us !
that was the best vacation ever !
i love our family .

the baby is sleeping .
you took away my future .
i'm simply returning the favor .
don't worry , i'll be a good mentor .
supportive , encouraging .
everything you weren't .
and in time , who knows , he might make a good sidekick .
he's getting away , bob !
we have to do something now .
what's happening?
stop him !
throw something !
i might hit jack jack .
throw me .
bob , throw me !
