brown bag .
close into one click .
yeah .
there's nothing sexier than short hair on a beautiful woman .
what is it about big hair that turns men on?
what is it about big hair that turns guys on anyway?
bad taste?

russians?
former soviets?
i forget .
new world order .
devine .
get used to it .
charles lindbergh .
lucky lindy or the lone eagle as he was called .
is our subject today because he was ... the first man to ... what?
megan?
fly over the atlantic?
very good .
first man to fly solo .
nonstop from new york city to paris .
and that was 1927 .
an astonishing accomplishment .
which brings us to today's assignment .
let's see which of you can navigate .
or fly if you will .
from our home base to our hero's website here ... in the fewest number of links .
all right?
and you're off .
well .
that's very clever .
dimitri .
megan .
might i have a word with you?
save me a seat .
okay?
okay .
come to my office .
take a seat .
now .
megan .
you know i understand ... the particular pressures of your life .
your father being who he is .
and the enormous expectations ... all adds up to rather a lot .
doesn't it?
yes .
sir .
hmm .
but .
none of that excuses ...
your breaking the honor code .
what?
i know all about you and dimitri .
megan .
we don't tolerate cheating .
now do we?
cheating?
mr. soneji .
there's been a mistake .
we only pass notes .
you know .
jokes and stuff .
megan .
before you go any further .
you best have a look at that .
mr. soneji?
yes?
this essay .
it isn't mine .
beg your pardon?
what do you mean?
oh .
my .
oh .
dear girl .
i'm ...
oh .
dear .
dear .
gary , why is the door locked?
oh .
my god .
what happened?
she's collapsed .
she's collapsed .
i tell you what .
you stay with her .
i'll get some help .
okay .
megan?
hey , sweetheart , can you hear me?
megan?
hey .
jezzie .
hi .
kila .
hey .
hannah .
where's megan?
she's with mr. soneji .
control .
i'm en route to soneji's classroom .
i'm sure it's just a meeting that went long .
well .
it's against procedure .
mr. soneji should know better .
his office .
mr. soneji .
secret service .
open up .
mr. soneji?
do you have a key?
i'm sorry .
there seems to be something stuck in here .
stand back .
control .
shut down .
stop all vehicles .
lock on soneji and rose .
so , how many of these boats you have to make before you become shipshape?
i have never seen a man work so hard at looking busy .
alex .
it's been eight months .
hmm?
it's time you forgave yourself .
vickie .
you know that forgiving yourself is the one thing a person cannot do .
... choose to make contact .
we are currently trying to put the pieces together as to how and why ... this man would murder a teacher and kidnap a young student .
here's a photograph of the missing student .
megan ann rose is 12 years old .
blond hair with hazel eyes .
she's 3'5" tall and weighs about 52 pounds .
she was last seen inside the school with the suspect around noon today .
we havejust received information ... that senior f. b. i. and secret service officials ... have arrived at the family home of senator rose .
we will go there live as soon as we have our satellite feed .
technicians are setting up extra telephone lines in the rose home , all in preparation should the kidnapper ...
mom ... please .
i just wanna go home .
the f. b. i. and police are on the lookout for this man .
gary soneji .
this is a recent photograph ...
we only know that he has ... disappeared with the 12 year old daughter of senator hank rose .
how and why is on the minds ...
police are trying to find out who this man really is , his motives for killing teacher amy masterson ...
we go back live to join ... reporter alison peretsky , who has been at the scene ... since law enforcement officials arrived .
yeah?
mom ... please .
i wanna go home .
hello?
you tuned into me .
dr. cross?
sounds like alison peretsky at wnkw action news .
gary soneji?
that'll do for now .
how'd you get this number?
unlisted numbers?
come on .
alex .
there's no such thing .
it's all out there in the air .
you just have to know how to grab it .
hey .
how do you feel about my kidnapping being bigger news ... than your little tragedy with jim gelway?
you ought to give an interview about what happened that night .
you know what they say about sharing your pain .
it's very cathartic .
thanks .
but i'm doing okay .
that's good to hear .
very good .
i thought for a while there you wouldn't be able to get ... your act back together .
and that would be a great shame .
i've been planning for a long .
long time to involve you ... in the fate of our little miss muffet .
megan .
do you have trouble saying her name?
first name rapport?
hostage negotiations 101?
now come on .
alex .
you can do better than that .
can't you?
you think you're gonna dissect me in three blinks of an eye?
i'm not that easy .
but with a little patience and a little help .
you just might profile me to a " t.
what makes you think i'm interested?
they say that when i die .
the case will die .
they say it'll be like a book i close .
but the book .
it will never close .
very poetic .
what the hell is it?
i've left something for your visit with the roses tonight .
you'll find it in your cold .
corrugated mailbox .
time to get back to work .
dr. cross .
indistinct ]
megan .
do you have trouble saying the name?
sorry .
detective .
this is a federal case .
i've been invited .
we have a detective who may have evidence pertinent to the case .
what should we do about it?
alex?
special agent craig .
well .
i'll be .
dare i ask?
in my mailbox .
anything else?
that'll get you inside .
terry .
get this to macarthur .
who's in charge?
ollie macarthur .
pedigree " feebie .
made his bones busting wackos in the seattle office .
soneji .
clean?
clean?
squeaky .
fibers look generic .
fingerprints .
nada .
the whole school's a goddamn forensic vacuum .
all he left us was one very neatly strangled teacher .
heads are gonna roll with the secret service .
oh .
jezzie flannigan .
alex cross .
agent flannigan was in charge of the secret service detail at cathedral .
dr. cross .
agent flannigan .
i've read your books on profiling .
obviously .
not close enough .
but ...
obviously .
not close enough .
but ...
kyle , this shoe was i. d. 'd by the roses .
it's megars .
dr. alex cross .
special agent in charge ...
oliver macarthur .
how do you do .
sir .
alex .
i'll catch you later .
forensics .
yes .
sir .
senator and mrs. rose are through here .
before we talk to them .
you any idea why soneji is involving you?
not at all .
this way .
uh .
excuse me .
shouldn't agent flannigan be in the room with us?
not a good idea .
miss flannigan is not welcome .
but she's a material witness .
she failed the roses .
and she failed the service .
i think agent macarthur has a point .
no .
he's missing the point .
you saw soneji every day .
five days a week .
for how long?
two years .
you have no idea how much you know about this case .
agent flannigan .
they say that when i die .
the case will die .
they say it'll be like a book i close .
but the book , it will never close .
very poetic .
what the hell is it?
i've left you something for your visit ... with the roses tonight .
you'll find it in your cold , corrugated mailbox .
well .
for what it's won'th .
that's soneji .
his speech patterrs the same .
is he .
um ...
are we dealing with a sex maniac?
someone who might , you know ...
no .
sir .
this man has no such interest in your daughter .
she's merely a means to an end .
what do you mean?
i see no standard procedure in anything he's done .
i disagree .
this is a professional kidnapping .
it's going to be about money .
which is good .
but you're saying it isn't about money .
i think he wants to draw this out .
from what he said , whatever his motives ... it's very unusual .
what did he mean about the book?
that it will never close?
i honestly don't know .
well .
i think i do .
let me tell you what this gary soneji is up to .
the last thing he wants is good crisis management .
what he wants is to confuse .
rancor .
mixed signals , disorientation , those are his tools .
so .
he calls a local cop .
a damaged cop , shouldering some heavy baggage .
he's using dr. cross as his messenger ...
excuse me .
the man that kidnapped our daughter didn't call you .
so your agenda is what?
to insult the man he did call?
mrs. rose .
i never intended ...
no , you wait a second .
a madman has our daughter , and for some reason he contacted this man .
do you know why?
no .
ma'am .
not yet .
hello .
you okay?
you .
uh ... got any tips for helpless situations?
well .
you could smoke a can'ton a day .
or you could bounce back .
yeah .
well .
i don't see anywhere to bounce to .
like to get out of here?
can i ask you something?
sure .
what did macarthur mean when he referred to you as damaged?
last summer .
i let a sting operation get out of control .
my partner was killed .
hello .
megan .
how are you?
coming to see you .
do you recognize my voice?
it's me .
mr. soneji .
hmm?
i brought you that .
a lovely cup of tea with honey .
i know your throat is sore .
it'll make you feel better .
there you go .
it's all right .
you have nothing to be scared of .
megan .
i'm not scared .
good .
but you're wondering what's going on .
i know what's going on .
you're a kidnapper .
and you're a sick weirdo .
megan .
you're the most opinionated girl in my class .
think you got that from your mom?
i wanna go home .
you will .
just promise me you're going to behave yourself .
okay?
so .
now listen .
if you need to use the bathroom or anything .
just press that .
okay?
i wanna go home !
now !
i brought you some fresh clothes .
please !
mr. soneji .
please !
this is a fine gun .
it's turkish .
handmade .
1924 .
that is nice .
my daddy won it in a game of poker .
aces and eights .
dead mars hand .
that's about as much as i know about my father .
have a seat .
do you know of any relationship between amy masterson and soneji?
amy?
no way .
why do you ask?
he strangled her .
it's an act of passion .
it's a demonstration of will .
a message .
take me seriously .
what do you see?
dr. cross ...
alex .
alex .
womars intuition .
third eye .
sixth sense ... whatever it is .
i don't have it .
sure you do .
you just don't look at it right .
every face has two aspects .
now try looking at it down the middle .
one side at a time .
would you say this man was confident?
yeah .
narcissistic?
l i wouldn't know .
ever see any flashes of hatred?
no .
no .
no !
anger?
hostility?
look .
everything about him was right .
he was always patient .
he was pleasant .
he had a sense of humor .
i mean .
he was the perfect teacher .
what do you see?
i see ...
no .
i mean about me .
what do you see about me?
that's why you're here .
isn't it?
size me up .
evaluate your primary material witness?
i see that you're about to start an argument .
i need to help get her back .
what makes you think i want a partner?
you don't .
i can understand that .
that's right .
no .
you can't .
can i tell you why i don't care?
shoot .
look .
when i was assigned to cathedral .
it was a job i didn't want .
it's a far cry from working rope lines or flying air force one .
but i have been there for three years .
i have been responsible for megan for three years .
and that little girl means more to me than even a partner .
can you understand that?
i suppose so .
even if i say no .
you'll probably follow me around wherever i go .
so .
if it's a choice between having you as a partner ... or as a stalker .
i guess i'll take my chances with a partner .
thank you .
the student drop off is there .
that's my morning post .
students sign in .
cameras are there .
there .
there and there .
motions sensors all around the periphery .
foolproof way to keep the kooks out .
exactly .
we were always looking in the wrong direction .
which door did he go out?
uh .
that one there .
it's a straight shot to his parking space .
let's go in .
his classroom .
mm hmm .
he was teaching how everything on the internet is connected .
alex .
you got a sec?
sure .
listen .
i think turf wars are a total waste of time .
if i was out of line last night .
i apologize .
don't .
i've been there .
anything you need .
let me know .
sure .
mac .
dr. cross , you might want to see this .
this was megars desk?
yeah .
what are you doing?
scoping glfs .
graphic interchange formats .
they're all stego encrypted .
somewhere among the billions of zeros and ones making this image ...
is a string of text .
i know about this .
it's the cutting edge method of passing notes in class .
it's driving the teachers nuts .
how long before you can access it?
try never .
you don't crack stego without a password .
would you take me to his office?
oh .
when you find soneji .
ask him for the password .
he planted a monitoring virus on the girl's hard drive .
every keystroke megan hit .
soneji was recording it .
good move .
jezz .
angling for a position with the d. c. p. d. i like that .
dr. cross .
agent ben devine .
agent devine is security systems supervisor .
well .
for now .
we're going to be thrown to the wolves .
as soon as they find megan rose dead in a ditch .
now what makes you so sure that's what's going to happen?
me getting fired or the girl in a ditch?
sorry .
i'm having a pessimistic day .
tell me .
soneji .
did he ... did he ever show any interest in what you do?
how you do it?
the man never talked to me .
i never talked to him .
well .
thanks for your time .
hello .
what?
what do you think that is?
an empty frame .
mm hmm .
otherwise known as ...
a missing picture .
you onto something?
our missing picture .
mm hmm .
our mr. soneji has a sense of humor .
he didn't just kidnap a little girl .
he turned it into a game .
okay .
let's see what you know .
mr. lindbergh .
my .
my .
what do you got?
dr. cross isn't in cyberspace anymore .
you're at a live site .
iooking through a video camera .
those arrows down there move it .
where are we?
i would guess we're in soneji's home .
now we're supposed to find out where that is .
oliver macarthur's office .
yeah .
it's me .
hold on .
how about the files?

not until we get the go ahead .
his surveillance was better than ours .
he's been at this for years .
imagine the patience , the dedication .
you sound like an admirer .
well .
he's ... he's like a spider .
and i happen to like spiders .
he had an elaborate setup here , boss .
want to see how he stayed clean at school?
it laminates a plastic veneer over your hands .
look at this .
it's foam rubber .
looks like he was wearing prosthetic appliances .
i understand the secret service are being cautious tonight .
there is speculation that a full investigation is under way into ...
yes , kevin , one of the secret service agents ...

what's the problem?

you've got a rule 21 problem ... no running lights .

and before the hood was pulled over his head .
he bragged to his executioner . " 'they think that when i die .
the case will die . " 'they think it will be like a book i close .
'but the book .
it will never close . " '
soneji was quoting the final words of richard bruno hauptman .
i'm sorry .
i don't follow .
1932 .
the infant son of charles lindbergh .
america's greatest hero .
was kidnapped .
when bruno hauptman was arrested , what followed became known as ...
the crime of the century .
i believe that soneji wants to do the same thing .
you think we're dealing with a copycat .
something like that .
dr. cross ... what does he want from you?
he's brought me in and left this trail ... because he wants me to make sure that he's properly appreciated .
but in order for him to achieve this ... he has to kill megan .
no .
no .
not necessarily .
the death of the lindbergh baby was accidental .
nevertheless .
it's critical that we pull his strings .
the more we make him a living legend .
the more likely he is to keep megan alive .
dr. cross , you've been brought into this case , what can you tell us about gary soneji?
i can tell you that soneji is very determined .
obviously highly capable and we consider him a serious adversary .
what about megan rose?
megan rose is gary soneji's ace .
as long as he has her , he's in control .
sir , would you assign as many agents to this case ... if she wasrt a senator's daughter?
the size of our task force is a reflection ... of who gary soneji is .
not megan rose .
mr. soneji .
you can parse the words if you'd like ...
hello?
i need to go to the bathroom .
all right .
be right there .

you promised me you were going to behave yourself .
because of you .
what you've done .
that man is dead .
now ... promise me .
promise me you're going to be a good little girl .
okay?
all right?
say .
yes .
mr. soneji .
say .
yes .
mr. soneji .
y yes .
mr. soneji .
okay .
let's go have that cup of tea .
i'd say eight hours .
about 9 : 00 a . m .
slugs are large caliber .
shots hit him here .
here .
kill shot tapped him crown of the head .
this here is thomas mathias .
he found all this .
this way .
she's not in the water .
jezzie .
soneji still has her .
there's no way of knowing that .
think about it .
megan is precious cargo .
soneji's not gonna let some twist of fate bring her harm .
right?
but why megan?
why her?
come on .
where are you going?
back to the city .
we'll talk in the car .
you asked .
why megan?
why megan?
who is senator hank rose?
he's ...
nobody .
most people don't even know who he is .
never heard of him .
couldrt pick him out of a lineup .
this is front page news now .
where will it be in two months?
ayear?
oblivion .
know why?
because senator hank rose is no charles lindbergh .
well .
okay .
then .
who is?
ah .
there's the troublesome question .
come on .
jezzie .
two years .
five days a week .
you know soneji .
who's a bigger fish than megan rose?
da .
mm hmm .
dr. cross .
agent flannigan .
we appreciate your concern .
but .
uh .
dimitri's fine .
our security services are more than capable ... of protecting the son of the russian president .
can we at least talk to him?
nothing would please us more than to be of help .
but speaking to dimitri right now would be inappropriate .
thanks for your time .
what?
well .
macarthur's dragnetting the bay .
right?
and .
i mean .
he's not really missing us .
so i was thinking maybe we could just stick around and .
you know .
scope out the place a bit .
agent flannigan .
are you ... are you suggesting a stakeout here?
yeah .
you know .
stale coffee .
some doughnuts .
no .
no .
that's a first class stakeout .
agent flannigan .
what you're talking about here would be no frills .
you'd only get to think about stale coffee and doughnuts .
well .
i can handle it if you can .
i get the feeling you've done this a lot .
oh .
yeah .
every chance i get .
especially when it's cold and wet .
no parking here .
we're on the clock .
officer .
everything okay?
everything is all right .
what's the problem?
go ahead .
jezzie .
what?
have one .
thank you .
alex .
that's dimitri .
jezzie .
it's him .
it's him !
soneji , hold it right there !
jezzie .
shoot the tires !
jezzie !
jezzie !
police !
don't shoot !
don't shoot !
jezzie !
jezzie .
you're gonna get megan back .
right?
yes .
we are .
i promise .
use this to get mr. soneji .
i will .
thank you .
you talk to hal .
i want you to bring him up to speed .
well done .
guys .
avert an international crisis and paint soneji into a corner .
not bad for a night's work .
soneji ditched a patrol car near reno park .
hijacked a tan sierra .
one bullet in the driver's head .
last seen heading toward route 50 .
annapolis .
i knew it .
seventy five thousand boats .
other marinas?
we're here .
dead fisherman here .
these .
all the marinas .
all locked down .
patrol boats in each of them .
all right .
listen up .
we gotta move fast .
roadblock route 50 and triple the surveillance in the harbors .
i want two choppers on the pad in five minutes .
let's go !
what's wrong?
i blew it .
that's what's wrong .
i had a shot right before he hit the hydrant .
but instead of pulling the trigger .
i was thinking .
i was thinking .
yeah .
you were thinking .
about your shot going astray ... and blowing soneji's head off .
in which case ...
we would never find megan .
i know that .
well .
then .
don't beat yourself up for being prudent .
you don't get it .
i was trained to shoot first and think later .
jezzie .
for heavers sake .
if you hadrt convinced me to stay there .
soneji would have two victims instead of one .
plus we'd have an international incident on our hands .
you did good .
you did good .
yes .
but still ...
anything?
oh .
not yet .
we're sitting on the area .

soneji's on the phone .

you ready?
all right .
now .

we can neither confirm nor deny that gary soneji ... was involved in the incident on the mta train this morning .
we've heard that a ransom was paid .
comment?
i can't comment on any of that .
what about megan rose?
i'm not going to go into any details at this time .
what about soneji's state of mind?
i'm not going to comment on his mental stability .
you can draw your own conclusions .
now , senator rose has agreed to make a statement ,
so?
the file on soneji .
is it still on your kitchen table?
yeah .
why?
i'm gonna have another look at it .
this business about the diamonds .
money .
i didn't see it coming .
i am grateful that the f. b. i. is here .
with the objective expertise to find out where my daughter is .
secondly , i now ...
this is worse than killing time .
yeah .
but you'd be amazed at how often the small .
neglected things ... become the most important .
i just got the feeling we're missing something .
maybe i'm in the wrong line of work .
maybe i should take on something less challenging .
you do what you are .
jezzie .
you mean .
you are what you do .
no .
i mean .
you do what you are .
you're born with a gift .
if not that .
then you get good at something along the way .
and what you're good at .
you don't take for granted .
you don't betray it .
what if you do betray your gift?
then .
you betray yourself .
that's a sad thing .
who is it?
police .
gary soneji .
hi .
alex .
now .
right hand .
thumb and forefinger .
just give me the gun .
alex .
you can't shoot me .
you'll never find megan .
sit down .
alex .
i'm i'm a little concerned .
alex .
i'm a little ...
i'm a little worried that you ... you don't really care to understand me anymore ; that you won't paint an accurate portrait .
and i need you to convince me that i'm wrong .
in order to do that .
we're going to have to talk about megan rose .
no .
no bargaining .
alex .
no cheap interrogation techniques .
it's transparent .
and it's clumsy .
this is between me and you .
i want you to see .
i want you to look inside here and tell me what the fuck you see !
i'm a gift to you , alex .
i'm a gift to you .
and you are beyond ... pitiful if you cannot understand that .
i'm living proof that a mind ... the mind is a terrible thing .
i see you've got your sense of humor back .
yeah .
i wondered what happened to it during the ransom drop .
the ransom drop .
that was a well earned 12 million .
twelve million .
senator rose says he can pull strings .
he says he can fix it so you keep the 12 million and walk .
all you have to do is return the child .
where is megan?
where's megan?
where is megan?
where's megan?
where is megan?
where is megan?
she's trapped on my boat .
alex .
isn't that right?
or maybe she's stuck in a warehouse somewhere or floating in a river .
swinging from the end of a rope .
buried alive .
i envy her .
what would life had been like with parents like that?
come on , gary , blaming your parents for what you are?
i'm not blaming them , alex .
they've been punished already .
i burned down the house while they slept .
i was 15 years old .
was it what you expected?
not really .
it was a new experience .
what .
killing?
no .
being in the newspapers .
so , in your opinion , doctor , were my actions triggered by nature ... or nurture?
if you want me to be brutally honest ...
i think you just have a morbid desire to burn in hell .
we're done for today .
i'm taking her with me .
you're not taking her anywhere .
i'll send her back to you .
you just tell me which piece you want first .
aah !
ow !
oh , shit !
damn it .
alex !
oh .
my god .
what have you done?
what have you d done?
residents of this normally quiet suburb are still in shock ... as news of the shooting of gary soneji .
america's most wanted man .
filtered through their community .
apparently , soneji had attempted to confront , or even harm ... members of the kidnapping task force hunting him .
so .
he came after jezzie as payback for dimitri .
ostensibly .
yeah .
that's how you want it on record?
yeah .
for now .
here they come .
dr. cross .
tell me you have at least an idea where my little girl is .
i'm sorry .
sir .
i can't .
you kill the one man who has the answers .
and you're telling me you haven't a clue .
not one clue?
the man walked in the fucking room .
and you shot him .
senator ... standing in his shoes .
i'd have done the same thing .
sir .
that's your job .
not his .
he's supposed to find my little girl .
not shoot the man who knows where she is .
senator .
it's not over .
the book is not closed .
alex ... thank you for saving my life .
good bye .
jezzie .
wanna hear something funny .
mac?
sure .
cheer me up .
i congratulated soneji on scoring $ 12 million .
you mean ten million .
exactly .
he had no idea what i was talking about .
i know you .
you work at my school .
eat your food .
megan .
alex .
where is this going?
we've been through these tapes backwards and forwards .
i can't see how this is helping us find megan .
you know what i see , mac?
someone was onto soneji long before we ever heard of him .
look at this .
what do you see?
agent devine hauling ass out to the front gate .
mac .
he could have shut this whole place down from right there .
now .
you wanna tell me why he didn't?
good god .
devine was in on it with him .
then .
when soneji hit the embassy .
he pulled a double cross .
he ran his own ransom .
no .
soneji was a loner .
an accomplice would have been beneath him .
i'll tell you what happened .
soneji was hoodwinked .
and so were we .
details are still emerging .
the manunt that began over a week ago in the natiors capitol ...
came to a violent end yesterday , [ clattering ]
with the death of kidnapper , gary soneji .
don't move .
turn around .
hands on the wall .
feet apart .
hi .
jez .
where'd you come from?
you know something .
devine .
you're pretty stupid .
your car in the driveway .
tv so loud .
you wouldn't be able to hear a swat team come in .
what are you doing ...
shut up !
where's megan?
she's in the barn .
she was so doped up .
i don't think she knew i took her off the boat .
she's still alive?
you were supposed to dump her in the river ...
after you got the diamonds .
yeah .
well .
maybe killing a kid is something i'm not prepared to do on my own .
anyway .
today .
tomorrow .
it's still gonna look like soneji killed her .
she can't die after soneji .
you idiot .
it doesn't make any difference .
they're never gonna find the body .
okay .
i'll go do it now .
will that make you happy?
yeah .
it would .
wait !
can i see them?
hey .
do you realize we spent an entire year ... following soneji's every move?
i think we deserve these .
that beats the hell out of a secret service pension .
huh?
profiling the profiler .
kidnap from the kidnapper .
that's brilliant .
you are a genius .
jez .
genius has nothing to do with it .
i'm just good at what i do .
didrt hurt that everyone else involved was a complete half wit .
you think alex cross is a half wit?
you really believe that he shot soneji to save my life?
cross pulled the trigger because he knew soneji didn't have megan .
what are you saying?
i'm saying that sooner or later .
he's gonna figure it out .
he already knows soneji didn't run the ransom .
he's onto us already .
isn't he?
no .
he's not onto us .
but i think he's onto you .
it's turkish .
my daddy won it in a game of poker .
that's about as much as i know about my father .
megan?
megan .
it's me .
honey .
jezzie?
jezzie?
jezzie .
jezzie .
i'm in here !
jezzie !
open up .
honey .
i'm gonna take you home .
it's all over .
yeah .
sure .
just hold on a second .
jezzie?
yeah .
honey .
what happened to that other guy?
he's dead .
megan .
you're safe now .
open up .
jezzie?
yeah , honey .
why isn't there anyone else with you?
megan .
it's me .
don't be scared of me .
open the door .
megan , i'm gonna ask you one more time to open the door .
right now .
open the door !
megan , open the door for me .
listen to me !
open the door !
megan .
open the fucking door !
open it , bitch !
stop it !
no !
stop it !
that was very clever .
megan .
shh .
shh .
shh .
jezzie?
it's over .
drop the gun .
alex ... how how did you .
um ...
aces and eights .
jezzie .
plus , your timing was a little off .
i watched the tapes .
you and devine could have stopped soneji at the school .
just like you could have stopped him at the russian embassy .
but you had a different agenda .
you know something .
alex?
when you said .
you do what you are .
you were right .
i'm living proof .
put the gun down .
jezzie .
would you kill another partner?
you're not my partner .
are you all right?
you're a very brave girl .
megan .
who are you?
i'm a policeman .
my name is alex cross .
i'm a friend of your parents .
can you take me to them?
nothing would give me greater pleasure .
could you ...
ah .

brown bag , this is brown bird .
we have audio visual .
do you think it's sexy?
brown bag .
close into one click .
yeah .
there's nothing sexier than short hair on a beautiful woman .
what is it about big hair that turns men on?
what is it about big hair that turns guys on anyway?
bad taste?
look at me .
i want to see your eyes .
innocent .
just the way i like 'em .
that's him .

you got the midas touch .
that's 'cause i'm god's gift to women .

charles lindbergh .
lucky lindy or the lone eagle as he was called .
is our subject today because he was ... the first man to ... what?
megan?
fly over the atlantic?
very good .
first man to fly solo .
nonstop from new york city to paris .
and that was 1927 .
an astonishing accomplishment .
which brings us to today's assignment .
let's see which of you can navigate .
or fly if you will .
from our home base to our hero's website here ... in the fewest number of links .
all right?
and you're off .
well .
that's very clever .
dimitri .
megan .
might i have a word with you?
save me a seat .
okay?
okay .
come to my office .
take a seat .
now .
megan .
you know i understand ... the particular pressures of your life .
your father being who he is .
and the enormous expectations ... all adds up to rather a lot .
doesn't it?
yes .
sir .
hmm .
but .
none of that excuses ...
your breaking the honor code .
what?
i know all about you and dimitri .
megan .
we don't tolerate cheating .
now do we?
cheating?
mr. soneji .
there's been a mistake .
we only pass notes .
you know .
jokes and stuff .
megan .
before you go any further .
you best have a look at that .
mr. soneji?
yes?
this essay .
it isn't mine .
beg your pardon?
what do you mean?
oh .
my .
oh .
dear girl .
i'm ...
oh .
dear .
dear .
gary , why is the door locked?
oh .
my god .
what happened?
she's collapsed .
she's collapsed .
i tell you what .
you stay with her .
i'll get some help .
okay .
megan?
hey , sweetheart , can you hear me?
megan?
hey .
jezzie .
hi .
kila .
hey .
hannah .
where's megan?
she's with mr. soneji .
control .
i'm en route to soneji's classroom .
i'm sure it's just a meeting that went long .
well .
it's against procedure .
mr. soneji should know better .
his office .
mr. soneji .
secret service .
open up .
mr. soneji?
do you have a key?
i'm sorry .
there seems to be something stuck in here .
stand back .
control .
shut down .
stop all vehicles .
lock on soneji and rose .
so , how many of these boats you have to make before you become shipshape?
i have never seen a man work so hard at looking busy .
alex .
it's been eight months .
hmm?
it's time you forgave yourself .
vickie .
you know that forgiving yourself is the one thing a person cannot do .
... choose to make contact .
we are currently trying to put the pieces together as to how and why ... this man would murder a teacher and kidnap a young student .
here's a photograph of the missing student .
megan ann rose is 12 years old .
blond hair with hazel eyes .
she's 3'5" tall and weighs about 52 pounds .
she was last seen inside the school with the suspect around noon today .
we havejust received information ... that senior f. b. i. and secret service officials ... have arrived at the family home of senator rose .
we will go there live as soon as we have our satellite feed .
technicians are setting up extra telephone lines in the rose home , all in preparation should the kidnapper ...
mom ... please .
i just wanna go home .
the f. b. i. and police are on the lookout for this man .
gary soneji .
this is a recent photograph ...
we only know that he has ... disappeared with the 12 year old daughter of senator hank rose .
how and why is on the minds ...
police are trying to find out who this man really is , his motives for killing teacher amy masterson ...
we go back live to join ... reporter alison peretsky , who has been at the scene ... since law enforcement officials arrived .
yeah?
mom ... please .
i wanna go home .
hello?
you tuned into me .
dr. cross?
sounds like alison peretsky at wnkw action news .
gary soneji?
that'll do for now .
how'd you get this number?
unlisted numbers?
come on .
alex .
there's no such thing .
it's all out there in the air .
you just have to know how to grab it .
hey .
how do you feel about my kidnapping being bigger news ... than your little tragedy with jim gelway?
you ought to give an interview about what happened that night .
you know what they say about sharing your pain .
it's very cathartic .
thanks .
but i'm doing okay .
that's good to hear .
very good .
i thought for a while there you wouldn't be able to get ... your act back together .
and that would be a great shame .
i've been planning for a long .
long time to involve you ... in the fate of our little miss muffet .
megan .
do you have trouble saying her name?
first name rapport?
hostage negotiations 101?
now come on .
alex .
you can do better than that .
can't you?
you think you're gonna dissect me in three blinks of an eye?
i'm not that easy .
but with a little patience and a little help .
you just might profile me to a " t.
what makes you think i'm interested?
they say that when i die .
the case will die .
they say it'll be like a book i close .
but the book .
it will never close .
very poetic .
what the hell is it?
i've left something for your visit with the roses tonight .
you'll find it in your cold .
corrugated mailbox .
time to get back to work .
dr. cross .
indistinct ]
megan .
do you have trouble saying the name?
sorry .
detective .
this is a federal case .
i've been invited .
we have a detective who may have evidence pertinent to the case .
what should we do about it?
alex?
special agent craig .
well .
i'll be .
dare i ask?
in my mailbox .
anything else?
that'll get you inside .
terry .
get this to macarthur .
who's in charge?
ollie macarthur .
pedigree " feebie .
made his bones busting wackos in the seattle office .
soneji .
clean?
clean?
squeaky .
fibers look generic .
fingerprints .
nada .
the whole school's a goddamn forensic vacuum .
all he left us was one very neatly strangled teacher .
heads are gonna roll with the secret service .
oh .
jezzie flannigan .
alex cross .
agent flannigan was in charge of the secret service detail at cathedral .
dr. cross .
agent flannigan .
i've read your books on profiling .
obviously .
not close enough .
but ...
obviously .
not close enough .
but ...
kyle , this shoe was i. d. 'd by the roses .
it's megars .
dr. alex cross .
special agent in charge ...
oliver macarthur .
how do you do .
sir .
alex .
i'll catch you later .
forensics .
yes .
sir .
senator and mrs. rose are through here .
before we talk to them .
you any idea why soneji is involving you?
not at all .
this way .
uh .
excuse me .
shouldn't agent flannigan be in the room with us?
not a good idea .
miss flannigan is not welcome .
but she's a material witness .
she failed the roses .
and she failed the service .
i think agent macarthur has a point .
no .
he's missing the point .
you saw soneji every day .
five days a week .
for how long?
two years .
you have no idea how much you know about this case .
agent flannigan .
they say that when i die .
the case will die .
they say it'll be like a book i close .
but the book , it will never close .
very poetic .
what the hell is it?
i've left you something for your visit ... with the roses tonight .
you'll find it in your cold , corrugated mailbox .
well .
for what it's won'th .
that's soneji .
his speech patterrs the same .
is he .
um ...
are we dealing with a sex maniac?
someone who might , you know ...
no .
sir .
this man has no such interest in your daughter .
she's merely a means to an end .
what do you mean?
i see no standard procedure in anything he's done .
i disagree .
this is a professional kidnapping .
it's going to be about money .
which is good .
but you're saying it isn't about money .
i think he wants to draw this out .
from what he said , whatever his motives ... it's very unusual .
what did he mean about the book?
that it will never close?
i honestly don't know .
well .
i think i do .
let me tell you what this gary soneji is up to .
the last thing he wants is good crisis management .
what he wants is to confuse .
rancor .
mixed signals , disorientation , those are his tools .
so .
he calls a local cop .
a damaged cop , shouldering some heavy baggage .
he's using dr. cross as his messenger ...
excuse me .
the man that kidnapped our daughter didn't call you .
so your agenda is what?
to insult the man he did call?
mrs. rose .
i never intended ...
no , you wait a second .
a madman has our daughter , and for some reason he contacted this man .
do you know why?
no .
ma'am .
not yet .
hello .
you okay?
you .
uh ... got any tips for helpless situations?
well .
you could smoke a can'ton a day .
or you could bounce back .
yeah .
well .
i don't see anywhere to bounce to .
like to get out of here?
can i ask you something?
sure .
what did macarthur mean when he referred to you as damaged?
last summer .
i let a sting operation get out of control .
my partner was killed .
hello .
megan .
how are you?
coming to see you .
do you recognize my voice?
it's me .
mr. soneji .
hmm?
i brought you that .
a lovely cup of tea with honey .
i know your throat is sore .
it'll make you feel better .
there you go .
it's all right .
you have nothing to be scared of .
megan .
i'm not scared .
good .
but you're wondering what's going on .
i know what's going on .
you're a kidnapper .
and you're a sick weirdo .
megan .
you're the most opinionated girl in my class .
think you got that from your mom?
i wanna go home .
you will .
just promise me you're going to behave yourself .
okay?
so .
now listen .
if you need to use the bathroom or anything .
just press that .
okay?
i wanna go home !
now !
i brought you some fresh clothes .
please !
mr. soneji .
please !
this is a fine gun .
it's turkish .
handmade .
1924 .
that is nice .
my daddy won it in a game of poker .
aces and eights .
dead mars hand .
that's about as much as i know about my father .
have a seat .
do you know of any relationship between amy masterson and soneji?
amy?
no way .
why do you ask?
he strangled her .
it's an act of passion .
it's a demonstration of will .
a message .
take me seriously .
what do you see?
dr. cross ...
alex .
alex .
womars intuition .
third eye .
sixth sense ... whatever it is .
i don't have it .
sure you do .
you just don't look at it right .
every face has two aspects .
now try looking at it down the middle .
one side at a time .
would you say this man was confident?
yeah .
narcissistic?
l i wouldn't know .
ever see any flashes of hatred?
no .
no .
no !
anger?
hostility?
look .
everything about him was right .
he was always patient .
he was pleasant .
he had a sense of humor .
i mean .
he was the perfect teacher .
what do you see?
i see ...
no .
i mean about me .
what do you see about me?
that's why you're here .
isn't it?
size me up .
evaluate your primary material witness?
i see that you're about to start an argument .
i need to help get her back .
what makes you think i want a partner?
you don't .
i can understand that .
that's right .
no .
you can't .
can i tell you why i don't care?
shoot .
look .
when i was assigned to cathedral .
it was a job i didn't want .
it's a far cry from working rope lines or flying air force one .
but i have been there for three years .
i have been responsible for megan for three years .
and that little girl means more to me than even a partner .
can you understand that?
i suppose so .
even if i say no .
you'll probably follow me around wherever i go .
so .
if it's a choice between having you as a partner ... or as a stalker .
i guess i'll take my chances with a partner .
thank you .
the student drop off is there .
that's my morning post .
students sign in .
cameras are there .
there .
there and there .
motions sensors all around the periphery .
foolproof way to keep the kooks out .
exactly .
we were always looking in the wrong direction .
which door did he go out?
uh .
that one there .
it's a straight shot to his parking space .
let's go in .
his classroom .
mm hmm .
he was teaching how everything on the internet is connected .
alex .
you got a sec?
sure .
listen .
i think turf wars are a total waste of time .
if i was out of line last night .
i apologize .
don't .
i've been there .
anything you need .
let me know .
sure .
mac .
dr. cross , you might want to see this .
this was megars desk?
yeah .
what are you doing?
scoping glfs .
graphic interchange formats .
they're all stego encrypted .
somewhere among the billions of zeros and ones making this image ...
is a string of text .
i know about this .
it's the cutting edge method of passing notes in class .
it's driving the teachers nuts .
how long before you can access it?
try never .
you don't crack stego without a password .
would you take me to his office?
oh .
when you find soneji .
ask him for the password .
he planted a monitoring virus on the girl's hard drive .
every keystroke megan hit .
soneji was recording it .
good move .
jezz .
angling for a position with the d. c. p. d. i like that .
dr. cross .
agent ben devine .
agent devine is security systems supervisor .
well .
for now .
we're going to be thrown to the wolves .
as soon as they find megan rose dead in a ditch .
now what makes you so sure that's what's going to happen?
me getting fired or the girl in a ditch?
sorry .
i'm having a pessimistic day .
tell me .
soneji .
did he ... did he ever show any interest in what you do?
how you do it?
the man never talked to me .
i never talked to him .
well .
thanks for your time .
hello .
what?
what do you think that is?
an empty frame .
mm hmm .
otherwise known as ...
a missing picture .
you onto something?
our missing picture .
mm hmm .
our mr. soneji has a sense of humor .
he didn't just kidnap a little girl .
he turned it into a game .
okay .
let's see what you know .
mr. lindbergh .

what do you got?
dr. cross isn't in cyberspace anymore .
you're at a live site .

those arrows down there move it .
where are we?
i would guess we're in soneji's home .
now we're supposed to find out where that is .

yeah .

not until we get the go ahead .
his surveillance was better than ours .
he's been at this for years .
imagine the patience , the dedication .
you sound like an admirer .
well .
he's ... he's like a spider .
and i happen to like spiders .
he had an elaborate setup here , boss .
want to see how he stayed clean at school?
it laminates a plastic veneer over your hands .
look at this .
it's foam rubber .
looks like he was wearing prosthetic appliances .
i understand the secret service are being cautious tonight .
there is speculation that a full investigation is under way into ...
yes , kevin , one of the secret service agents ...

what's the problem?

you've got a rule 21 problem ... no running lights .

and before the hood was pulled over his head .
he bragged to his executioner . " 'they think that when i die .
the case will die . " 'they think it will be like a book i close .
'but the book .
it will never close . " '
soneji was quoting the final words of richard bruno hauptman .
i'm sorry .
i don't follow .
1932 .
the infant son of charles lindbergh .
america's greatest hero .
was kidnapped .
when bruno hauptman was arrested , what followed became known as ...
the crime of the century .
i believe that soneji wants to do the same thing .
you think we're dealing with a copycat .
something like that .
dr. cross ... what does he want from you?
he's brought me in and left this trail ... because he wants me to make sure that he's properly appreciated .
but in order for him to achieve this ... he has to kill megan .
no .
no .
not necessarily .
the death of the lindbergh baby was accidental .
nevertheless .
it's critical that we pull his strings .
the more we make him a living legend .
the more likely he is to keep megan alive .
dr. cross , you've been brought into this case , what can you tell us about gary soneji?
i can tell you that soneji is very determined .
obviously highly capable and we consider him a serious adversary .
what about megan rose?
megan rose is gary soneji's ace .
as long as he has her , he's in control .
sir , would you assign as many agents to this case ... if she wasrt a senator's daughter?
the size of our task force is a reflection ... of who gary soneji is .
not megan rose .
mr. soneji .
you can parse the words if you'd like ...
hello?
i need to go to the bathroom .
all right .
be right there .
come on .

you promised me you were going to behave yourself .
because of you .
what you've done .
that man is dead .
now ... promise me .
promise me you're going to be a good little girl .
okay?
all right?
say .
yes .
mr. soneji .
say .
yes .
mr. soneji .
y yes .
mr. soneji .
okay .
let's go have that cup of tea .
i'd say eight hours .
about 9 : 00 a . m .
slugs are large caliber .
shots hit him here .
here .
kill shot tapped him crown of the head .
this here is thomas mathias .
he found all this .
this way .
she's not in the water .
jezzie .
soneji still has her .
there's no way of knowing that .
think about it .
megan is precious cargo .
soneji's not gonna let some twist of fate bring her harm .
right?
but why megan?
why her?
come on .
where are you going?
back to the city .
we'll talk in the car .
you asked .
why megan?
why megan?
who is senator hank rose?
he's ...
nobody .
most people don't even know who he is .
never heard of him .
couldrt pick him out of a lineup .
this is front page news now .
where will it be in two months?
ayear?
oblivion .
know why?
because senator hank rose is no charles lindbergh .
well .
okay .
then .
who is?
ah .
there's the troublesome question .
come on .
jezzie .
two years .
five days a week .
you know soneji .
who's a bigger fish than megan rose?
da .
mm hmm .
dr. cross .
agent flannigan .
we appreciate your concern .
but .
uh .
dimitri's fine .
our security services are more than capable ... of protecting the son of the russian president .
can we at least talk to him?
nothing would please us more than to be of help .
but speaking to dimitri right now would be inappropriate .
thanks for your time .
what?
well .
macarthur's dragnetting the bay .
right?
and .
i mean .
he's not really missing us .
so i was thinking maybe we could just stick around and .
you know .
scope out the place a bit .
agent flannigan .
are you ... are you suggesting a stakeout here?
yeah .
you know .
stale coffee .
some doughnuts .
no .
no .
that's a first class stakeout .
agent flannigan .
what you're talking about here would be no frills .
you'd only get to think about stale coffee and doughnuts .
well .
i can handle it if you can .
i get the feeling you've done this a lot .
oh .
yeah .
every chance i get .
especially when it's cold and wet .
no parking here .
we're on the clock .
officer .
everything okay?
everything is all right .
what's the problem?
go ahead .
jezzie .
what?
have one .
thank you .
alex .
that's dimitri .
jezzie .
it's him .
it's him !
soneji , hold it right there !
jezzie .
shoot the tires !
jezzie !
jezzie !
police !
don't shoot !
don't shoot !
jezzie !
jezzie .
you're gonna get megan back .
right?
yes .
we are .
i promise .
use this to get mr. soneji .
i will .
thank you .
you talk to hal .
i want you to bring him up to speed .
well done .
guys .
avert an international crisis and paint soneji into a corner .
not bad for a night's work .
soneji ditched a patrol car near reno park .
hijacked a tan sierra .
one bullet in the driver's head .
last seen heading toward route 50 .
annapolis .
i knew it .
seventy five thousand boats .
other marinas?
we're here .
dead fisherman here .
these .
all the marinas .
all locked down .

all right .
listen up .
we gotta move fast .
roadblock route 50 and triple the surveillance in the harbors .
i want two choppers on the pad in five minutes .
let's go !
what's wrong?
i blew it .
that's what's wrong .
i had a shot right before he hit the hydrant .
but instead of pulling the trigger .
i was thinking .
i was thinking .
yeah .
you were thinking .
about your shot going astray ... and blowing soneji's head off .
in which case ...
we would never find megan .
i know that .
well .
then .
don't beat yourself up for being prudent .
you don't get it .
i was trained to shoot first and think later .
jezzie .
for heavers sake .
if you hadrt convinced me to stay there .
soneji would have two victims instead of one .
plus we'd have an international incident on our hands .
you did good .
you did good .
yes .
but still ...
anything?
oh .
not yet .
we're sitting on the area .
chief .
soneji's on the phone .
soneji?

we can neither confirm nor deny that gary soneji ... was involved in the incident on the mta train this morning .
we've heard that a ransom was paid .
comment?
i can't comment on any of that .
what about megan rose?
i'm not going to go into any details at this time .
what about soneji's state of mind?
i'm not going to comment on his mental stability .
you can draw your own conclusions .
now , senator rose has agreed to make a statement ,
so?
the file on soneji .
is it still on your kitchen table?
yeah .
why?
i'm gonna have another look at it .
this business about the diamonds .
money .
i didn't see it coming .
i am grateful that the f. b. i. is here .
with the objective expertise to find out where my daughter is .
secondly , i now ...
this is worse than killing time .
yeah .
but you'd be amazed at how often the small .
neglected things ... become the most important .
i just got the feeling we're missing something .
maybe i'm in the wrong line of work .
maybe i should take on something less challenging .
you do what you are .
jezzie .
you mean .
you are what you do .
no .
i mean .
you do what you are .
you're born with a gift .
if not that .
then you get good at something along the way .
and what you're good at .
you don't take for granted .
you don't betray it .
what if you do betray your gift?
then .
you betray yourself .
that's a sad thing .
who is it?
police .
gary soneji .
hi .
alex .
now .
right hand .
thumb and forefinger .
just give me the gun .
alex .
you can't shoot me .
you'll never find megan .
sit down .
alex .
i'm i'm a little concerned .
alex .
i'm a little ...
i'm a little worried that you ... you don't really care to understand me anymore ; that you won't paint an accurate portrait .
and i need you to convince me that i'm wrong .
in order to do that .
we're going to have to talk about megan rose .
no .
no bargaining .
alex .
no cheap interrogation techniques .
it's transparent .
and it's clumsy .
this is between me and you .
i want you to see .
i want you to look inside here and tell me what the fuck you see !
i'm a gift to you , alex .
i'm a gift to you .
and you are beyond ... pitiful if you cannot understand that .
i'm living proof that a mind ... the mind is a terrible thing .
i see you've got your sense of humor back .
yeah .
i wondered what happened to it during the ransom drop .
the ransom drop .
that was a well earned 12 million .
twelve million .
senator rose says he can pull strings .
he says he can fix it so you keep the 12 million and walk .
all you have to do is return the child .
where is megan?
where's megan?
where is megan?
where's megan?
where is megan?
where is megan?
she's trapped on my boat .
alex .
isn't that right?
or maybe she's stuck in a warehouse somewhere or floating in a river .
swinging from the end of a rope .
buried alive .
i envy her .
what would life had been like with parents like that?
come on , gary , blaming your parents for what you are?
i'm not blaming them , alex .
they've been punished already .
i burned down the house while they slept .
i was 15 years old .
was it what you expected?
not really .
it was a new experience .
what .
killing?
no .
being in the newspapers .
so , in your opinion , doctor , were my actions triggered by nature ... or nurture?
if you want me to be brutally honest ...
i think you just have a morbid desire to burn in hell .
we're done for today .
i'm taking her with me .
you're not taking her anywhere .
i'll send her back to you .
you just tell me which piece you want first .
aah !
ow !
oh , shit !
damn it .
alex !
oh .
my god .
what have you done?
what have you d done?
residents of this normally quiet suburb are still in shock ... as news of the shooting of gary soneji .
america's most wanted man .
filtered through their community .
apparently , soneji had attempted to confront , or even harm ... members of the kidnapping task force hunting him .
so .
he came after jezzie as payback for dimitri .
ostensibly .
yeah .
that's how you want it on record?
yeah .
for now .
here they come .
dr. cross .
tell me you have at least an idea where my little girl is .
i'm sorry .
sir .
i can't .
you kill the one man who has the answers .
and you're telling me you haven't a clue .
not one clue?
the man walked in the fucking room .
and you shot him .
senator ... standing in his shoes .
i'd have done the same thing .
sir .
that's your job .
not his .
he's supposed to find my little girl .
not shoot the man who knows where she is .
senator .
it's not over .
the book is not closed .
alex ... thank you for saving my life .
good bye .
jezzie .
wanna hear something funny .
mac?
sure .
cheer me up .
i congratulated soneji on scoring $ 12 million .
you mean ten million .
exactly .
he had no idea what i was talking about .
i know you .
you work at my school .
eat your food .
megan .
alex .
where is this going?
we've been through these tapes backwards and forwards .
i can't see how this is helping us find megan .
you know what i see , mac?
someone was onto soneji long before we ever heard of him .
look at this .
what do you see?
agent devine hauling ass out to the front gate .
mac .
he could have shut this whole place down from right there .
now .
you wanna tell me why he didn't?
good god .
devine was in on it with him .
then .
when soneji hit the embassy .
he pulled a double cross .
he ran his own ransom .
no .
soneji was a loner .
an accomplice would have been beneath him .
i'll tell you what happened .
soneji was hoodwinked .
and so were we .
details are still emerging .
the manunt that began over a week ago in the natiors capitol ...
came to a violent end yesterday , [ clattering ]
with the death of kidnapper , gary soneji .
don't move .
turn around .
hands on the wall .
feet apart .
hi .
jez .
where'd you come from?
you know something .
devine .
you're pretty stupid .
your car in the driveway .
tv so loud .
you wouldn't be able to hear a swat team come in .
what are you doing ...
shut up !
where's megan?
she's in the barn .
she was so doped up .
i don't think she knew i took her off the boat .
she's still alive?
you were supposed to dump her in the river ...
after you got the diamonds .
yeah .
well .
maybe killing a kid is something i'm not prepared to do on my own .
anyway .
today .
tomorrow .
it's still gonna look like soneji killed her .
she can't die after soneji .
you idiot .
it doesn't make any difference .
they're never gonna find the body .
okay .
i'll go do it now .
will that make you happy?
yeah .
it would .
wait !
can i see them?
hey .
do you realize we spent an entire year ... following soneji's every move?
i think we deserve these .
that beats the hell out of a secret service pension .
huh?
profiling the profiler .
kidnap from the kidnapper .
that's brilliant .
you are a genius .
jez .
genius has nothing to do with it .
i'm just good at what i do .
didrt hurt that everyone else involved was a complete half wit .
you think alex cross is a half wit?
you really believe that he shot soneji to save my life?
cross pulled the trigger because he knew soneji didn't have megan .
what are you saying?
i'm saying that sooner or later .
he's gonna figure it out .
he already knows soneji didn't run the ransom .
he's onto us already .
isn't he?
no .
he's not onto us .
but i think he's onto you .
it's turkish .
my daddy won it in a game of poker .
that's about as much as i know about my father .
megan?
megan .
it's me .
honey .
jezzie?
jezzie?
jezzie .
jezzie .
i'm in here !
jezzie !
open up .
honey .
i'm gonna take you home .
it's all over .
yeah .
sure .
just hold on a second .
jezzie?
yeah .
honey .
what happened to that other guy?
he's dead .
megan .
you're safe now .
open up .
jezzie?
yeah , honey .
why isn't there anyone else with you?
megan .
it's me .
don't be scared of me .
open the door .
megan , i'm gonna ask you one more time to open the door .
right now .
open the door !
megan , open the door for me .
listen to me !
open the door !
megan .
open the fucking door !
open it , bitch !
stop it !
no !
stop it !
that was very clever .
megan .
shh .
shh .
shh .
jezzie?
it's over .
drop the gun .
alex ... how how did you .
um ...
aces and eights .
jezzie .
plus , your timing was a little off .
i watched the tapes .
you and devine could have stopped soneji at the school .
just like you could have stopped him at the russian embassy .
but you had a different agenda .
you know something .
alex?
when you said .
you do what you are .
you were right .
i'm living proof .
put the gun down .
jezzie .
would you kill another partner?
you're not my partner .
are you all right?
you're a very brave girl .
megan .
who are you?
i'm a policeman .
my name is alex cross .
i'm a friend of your parents .
can you take me to them?
nothing would give me greater pleasure .
could you ...
ah .
thanks .
