i was orphaned at an early age .
i had no name , so people called me nameless .
being a nobody , i studied swordsmanship .
after 10 years of practice
i acquired a unique skill .
the king of qin has summoned me .
my deeds have astonished the kingdom .
by order of his majesty we have brought the mighty warrior .
sky , flying snow and broken sword the three assassins from zhao have sought his majesty's life for 10 years .
his majesty has known no peace .
to the astonishment of all a mighty warrior of qin has smashed them .
his majesty can finally sleep at night !
we rejoice for our king !
this warrior sent from heaven has exterminated the assassins .
summon the warrior !
remain 100 paces from his majesty .
or you will be executed .
never forget that .
no one is allowed within 100 paces of me .
do you know why?
to guard against assassins .
yes .
that's why i am confined in this armor .
you have removed a great peril for me .
how should i reward you?
my service was for qin , not for a reward .
achievements must be rewarded .
sky's silver spear ... wounded many of my brave warriors .
announce my edict !
by order of his majesty he who kills sky will receive gold and land and be allowed to drink within 20 paces of his majesty .
i am informed you're a citizen of qin .
i am a prefect from leng meng county .
a county prefect over 10 square miles !
surely the lowest ranking official in qin .
how did you defeat such opponents?
i took them on one by one .
tell me the details .
does your majesty know
flying snow and broken sword were lovers?
yes , i do .
and that they hadn't spoken for three years?
for three years?
why?
flying snow had an affair with sky .
broken sword never forgave her .
why haven't i heard this before?
i went to great lengths to uncover it .
to divide flying snow and broken sword
i first needed to eliminate sky .
i have an idea of what you planned .
your majesty is wise .
what did you use to defeat sky?
the sword .
i must arrest criminals in my county .
on the fifth day of the sixth month
sky attended a chess house .
i had learnt he enjoyed playing chess and listening to music there .
so , the seven masters of qin palace .
we are here to arrest you !
identify yourself by showing your spear .
halt !
what can a minor official do?
this is my territory .
so?
you are on the king's most wanted list .
i am placing you under arrest .
old man , please play one more tune .
martial arts and music are different but they share the same principle .
both stress attaining a supreme state .
sky and i faced each other for a long time .
neither of us moved .
we fought the battle in our minds .
how swift thy sword !
i thought i knew everything about my kingdom .
i didn't know that leng meng county held a talent like yours .
broken sword .
flying snow .
by order of his majesty !
flying snow and broken sword have teamed up for assassination .
he who kills either of them will receive gold and land and be allowed to drink within 10 paces of his majesty .
three years ago , flying snow stormed the palace with broken sword .
3000 elite troops couldn't stop them .
i've since emptied the palace so assassins cannot hide .
was your sword swifter than theirs combined?
no .
how did you do it , then?
disguised as a citizen of zhao .
i sought them in the kingdom of zhao .
i learned they were hiding in a calligraphy school under the names highcliff and springbrook
rumor had it the qin army would attack that day .
most of the townspeople had fled .
only the school s students remained .
why have you come at such a time?
who are you?
i'm from yi county in the kingdom of zhao .
my father's dying wish was for one of your scrolls .
i fear this may be our school s last day .
which calligrapher do you seek?
i respectfully request master highcliff .
highcliff was broken sword .
legend said his skill as a swordsman was rooted in his calligraphy .
so i had my concerns .
i needed to find out if it was true .
what do you want written?
sword .
you are fond of the sword?
it was my father's dying wish .
what size scroll?
eight feet .
for that size i will need red ink .
my master has asked me to borrow some red ink .
my master wants to borrow some red ink .
did you hear me , master springbrook?
master highcliff wants to borrow red ink .
tell him to come himself .
could i have some red ink?
the character " sword " was still being written when your majesty's troops arrived at the city gates .
draw !
your majesty's army is invincible not only because it is brave but also because of its archery with a greater range than any other army .
the qin archers are like artillery intimidating the enemy .
hail !
hail !
hail !
please remember their arrows might destroy our town and topple our kingdom but they can never obliterate our culture .
today you will learn the essence of our culture .
hail !
hail !
hail !
those zhao people didn't flee?
they drew strength from their calligraphy .
what was so difficult about " sword "?
there are 19 different ways to write it .
i asked broken sword for a 20th way .
both calligraphy and swordplay rely on one's strength and spirit .
the 20th style would reveal the essence of his swordsmanship .
how odd to write it in 19 ways .
it makes the written language impossible to comprehend .
once i've conquered the six kingdoms and all the northern tribes
i will eradicate this problem by mandating one style of writing .
wouldn't that be ideal?
your majesty won't stop at the six kingdoms?
the six kingdoms are nothing !
i will lead my army to conquer vast lands and establish a great empire .
hail !
hail !
hail !
master springbrook .
why are you going outside?
to fend off the arrows .
you aren't needed .
stay inside .
the qin archers are powerful .
you alone may not stop them .
hail !
hail !
hail !
you are good .
you are even better .
you didn't come here for calligraphy .
who are you?
i've traveled here to deliver an item .
please meet me in the library at midnight .
great calligraphy .
great swordplay .
you didn't even see my swordplay .
i couldn't have written without it .
at midnight meet me in the library .
several hundred thousand qin troops were readying for the next onslaught .
i studied the character all night trying to unlock the secret of his skills .
it would reveal his swordsmanship?
but it's just an ordinary word .
calligraphy and swordplay are similar .
one must comprehend their true essence .
did you discover it?
it eluded me .
so how did you challenge them?
although they hadn't spoken in three years they spied on each other .
at midnight
broken sword would peek into flying snow's room .
at 2 o'clock in the morning she would spy on broken sword .
what strange behavior .
i was surprised too .
so i used sky's silver spear to get to them .
sky died by your sword?
yes .
who are you?
why are you here?
i'm from the kingdom of qin .
i have a message from sky .
go on .
he said he had lived a life without responsibilities or commitments .
he cared for only one person .
who?
flying snow .
sky was certain she'd avenge his death .
to fight , meet me at the qin camp .
you can leave now .
go !
i know you saw us !
let me tell you we've been together for three years .
i let you see us on purpose !
i no longer care about you at all !
we were both very foolish .
i just wanted you to care about me .
i'm not going to fight you .
go away !
i will kill you in honor of my master !
you ask to die .
i will help you .
why do you laugh?
what you did last night was stupid .
my plan proved successful .
when flying snow was fighting me she was disturbed and disoriented .
i defeated her easily .
i never imagined supreme warriors
like broken sword and flying snow allowing their emotions to be a liability .
it sounds as if you did divide them .
yes .
in that case , they must have been petty and narrow minded .
true .
your story sounds logical .
but you have underestimated one person .
who?
me .
would you like my impression of them?
three years ago they stormed the palace .
i was impressed by their valor and dignity .
their character could not be petty .
so flying snow's affair with sky is a lie .
their betrayal of one another is a lie .
the story you just told is a lie !
except for one thing .
sky did know one of you .
who?
you .
i surmise you two were old friends .
and sky's defeat has only one explanation .
what's that?
he permitted it .
to kill me , the two of you formed a pact using my men as witnesses .
that was not hard to arrange .
the hardest part was to persuade sky to put his life in your hands .
you were not fast enough to defeat sky .
he died willingly under your sword .
such devotion deserves true respect .
he was the first to sacrifice himself for your mission .
sky was proud .
he saw himself as an unrivalled fighter .
what convinced him you could succeed where he had failed?
you have trained , perhaps for 10 years with one goal , my assassination .
you have a great skill that few can counter .
killing sky got you within 20 paces of me .
so why seek out broken sword and flying snow?
i surmise that your skill requires you to come within 10 paces .
you needed a second sacrifice to claim another reward to bring you within 10 paces .
although broken sword and flying snow had never met sky they instantly understood the reason for his defeat .
how far am i from the bookshelves?
about 10 paces .
10 paces is fine .
i need one of you to help me .
please decide between yourselves .
meet me at the qin camp tomorrow morning .
how swift thy sword !
true .
sky was a superior warrior .
he willingly gave his life to this man .
he can kill the king .
we must proceed .
that means we will die .
then we die together .
you were one step ahead of me .
did i hurt you too much?
i should be the one who fights him .
i want you to live .
if you died , how could i live?
you will live on , promise me .
say it !
all right .
moon is on her way .
i had better go .
i am nameless , prefect of leng meng county .
please allow me to fight this assassin .
she is on his majesty's most wanted list .
now she's here , i will arrest her .
the assassin and i have an agreement to fight one on one .
should i be unable to defeat her please apprehend her .
your permission is sought .
draw your sword !
hail !
hail !
hail !
make your move !
hail !
hail !
hail !
i die willingly .
make your move .
hail !
hail !
hail !
hail !
hail !
hail !
hail !
hail !
hail !
hail !
hail !
hail !
how swift thy sword ! .
what are you here for?
for what you once said .
i will fight the one who harms flying snow .
please draw your sword .
thank you .
i believe you and broken sword also fought but rather it was a fight to honor flying snow .
my master wishes you to have his sword .
why?
he and she are bound in life and death .
they will never part , nor will their swords .
it is his dying wish that you take his sword for your mission .
sky , flying snow and broken sword sacrificed themselves so you can be within 10 paces of me .
all three gave you their lives .
the best of friends could not give more .
therefore you are the most dangerous assassin of all .
how did you uncover my plan?
the flames of these candles are disturbed by your murderous intent
all of you are willing to die for a cause .
i'm ashamed to say i am not that committed .
your majesty has seen through our plan .
if i had realized this sooner
i wouldn't have allowed you so close .
a citizen of qin would not do this .
who are you?
a man of zhao .
your qin soldiers killed my family .
i wandered into qin and was adopted .
i discovered my real identity 10 years ago and set my heart on this plan .
you've come to avenge zhao .
i see .
i would like to know if your special skill has a name .
as your majesty guessed there is only one crucial move .
what is that?
death within 10 paces .
death within 10 paces . " a good name !
all my guards are 100 paces away outside the palace .
you are within 10 paces .
it would seem that today i am doomed .
but i sense your hesitation .
your majesty is perceptive .
however you too have underestimated someone .
who?
broken sword .
i needed to prove to them that my sword was fast and accurate .
within 10 paces my sword strikes with surgical precision .
if it enters at precise pressure points it will not cause any fatal injury .
if one of you would take a blow before witnesses , we can fool the king .
such a blow is hardly child's play .
how is sky now?
fully recovered .
his trust in your sword was extraordinary .
the king's security is impenetrable .
there was no other way .
his imperial guards were useless .
he should have died three years ago .
what went wrong?
i abandoned the plan .
the king must not be killed .
he said that?
yes .
why?
i also asked him .
what did he say?
he would not explain that day .
broken sword is the strongest of the three .
he and i are probably equal in skills .
what he told me later greatly unsettled me .
while i'm alive
i'll stop you assassinating the king .
i will help you .
he let the opportunity go by .
this time , we must succeed .
see you tomorrow at the qin camp .
please do me a favor .
help me fight broken sword !
master !
what are you waiting for?
although i had agreed to help her attack from behind is dishonorable so i couldn't draw my sword .
but we both knew if we did not stop broken sword we would never succeed .
moon , don't !
you're no match for him .
stop .
i knew this would happen .
you can't stop me now .
even wounded , i will still stop you .
then i will kill you !
did i hurt him too much?
your special medicine should heal his wounds in a day .
have you delivered it?
i tended to the wound myself .
after the battle , take my sword and follow nameless to see the king .
yes .
they won't treat a servant harshly .
if the assassination succeeds wave a red flag on your return .
if it fails , a yellow one .
if something happens to you any message will be useless .
i will smile from heaven if i see a red flag .
how is flying snow?
she is resting .
she doesn't know i've come .
you said you'd stop me .
please abandon the mission .
you know i am a man of zhao .
so am i.
doesn't qin want to conquer zhao?
yes .
isn't the king the enemy of zhao?
yes .
who are you trying to defend?
you call yourself a man of zhao?
flying snow has asked me that too .
when we first met
i was living a carefree life .
i fell in love with her after our first fight .
she's the daughter of a zhao general who died in battle against qin .
she inherited his sword .
i knew she would avenge her father .
i promised to help her .
calligraphy and swordplay share the same principles .
we did calligraphy to inspire our swordplay and to heighten our powers .
she knew i'd drifted since childhood calling no place home .
once we'd killed the king , she said she would take me to her home .
there'd be no more swordsmen only a man and a woman .
the essence of calligraphy is from the soul .
swordsmanship is the same .
both aspire to truth and simplicity .
gradually i recognized a greater cause .
three years ago we perfected our skills .
flying snow insisted on going ahead .
together , we stormed the palace .
she asked why i had abandoned the mission
i told her the king must not be killed .
that is what calligraphy taught me .
i didn't kill the king .
after that she refused to talk to me .
please abandon your plan .
no .
was your sword forged in hatred?
yes .
for 10 years , it has never tired .
i can't stop now .
how can i dissuade you?
only by killing me .
are you that determined?
yes .
allow me to convey my conviction in three words .
these words express my mind .
please consider .
moon , give my sword to master nameless .
flying snow and i will never part nor will our swords .
master nameless although i am just a humble servant allow me to say a few words .
i've been with my master since i was eight .
he taught me martial arts and how to be a decent person .
whatever my master does is for a good reason .
the words he has given you carry a deep meaning .
this will be the last thing i can do for my master .
master nameless , please take his advice .
why did you want to do that?
i wanted to follow the example of my master and to persuade you with my life .
you're still young .
life is precious .
if you must die you should die for a greater cause .
be on your way .
i will remember what should be remembered .
what were the words he wrote?
all under heaven .
all under heaven ...
broken sword said
the people have suffered years of warfare .
only the king of qin can stop the chaos by uniting all under heaven .
he asked me to abandon the assassination for the greater good of all .
he said , one person's suffering is nothing compared to the suffering of many .
the rivalry of zhao and qin is trivial compared to the greater cause .
the person who really understands me is my most feared enemy .
alone , i have endured so much criticism .
so many attempts on my life .
no one understands my intentions .
even my court officials see me as a tyrant .
but i never imagined that broken sword , my arch enemy would truly understand and appreciate my real motives .
i would like to know how you mean to kill me without your sword?
by capturing yours !
this sword has protected me through all my battles .
having found a true confidant in broken sword if i die , i am content with my life .
let " all under heaven " guide your decision .
it's just dawned on me !
this scroll of broken sword's isn't about sword technique but about swordsmanship's ultimate ideal .
swordsmanship's first achievement is the unity of man and sword .
once this unity is attained even a blade of grass can be a weapon .
the second achievement is when the sword exists in one's heart when absent from one's hand one can strike an enemy at 100 paces even with bare hands .
swordsmanship's ultimate achievement is the absence of the sword in both hand and heart .
the swordsman is at peace with the rest of the world .
he vows not to kill and to bring peace to mankind .
your majesty , your visions have convinced me
that you are committed to the highest ideal of ultimate swordsmanship .
therefore i cannot kill you .
remember those who gave their lives for the highest ideal : peace .
no more killing nameless went within 10 paces of the king .
he could not have missed .
there is only one explanation .
he must have abandoned the mission .
what did you say to him?
i wrote three words .
what words?
all under heaven .
that is all you care about !
and you .
i don't believe you .
how can i convince you?
draw your sword .
you've misled nameless .
you've ruined sky and the kingdom of zhao .
draw !
when we first met ...
i had to prove myself to convince you .
what can i do this time?
just draw your sword !
why didn't you fend off my sword?
so that you'd believe me .
i always wanted to go home with you .
sadly , it won't happen now .
take good care of yourself .
why didn't you defend yourself?
why didn't you defend yourself?
why didn't you?
no more drifting , no more roaming .
i'm taking you home now .
our home .
your majesty , permission to execute?
permission to execute?
your majesty , permission to execute?
permission to execute?
he conspired to assassinate your majesty .
show no mercy !
this is the law of qin !
to conquer all under heaven the law must be enforced .
set an example for the world !
execute him !
execute him !
execute him !
execute him !
execute him !
execute him !
execute him !
hail !
hail !
hail !
hail !
hail !
hail !
