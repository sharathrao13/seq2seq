hey , punk .
i been thinkin '...
you been thinkin '?
that's a change of pace .
got a pretty big mouth for someone so ...
don't say it .
so short .
he ain't short !
i'm not short .
i'm just height challenged .
what's height challenged?
better than bein 'brain challenged .
you wanna back that big mouth up of yours and play me one on one for your jersey?
ox , leave him alone !
what's the matter , calvin?
don't push murph , man .
would you guys just stop this?
calvin , let's just go .
no , no .
let me handle this .
exactly how are you gonna handle this?
listen , if i say no ...
he beats you up .
ok .
now , if i say yes ...
he still beats you up .
and you'll lose your jersey .
listen ...
i can take him .
i mean , kobe wouldn't back down from no challenge .
allen iverson wouldn't back down from no challenge .
and michael jordan sure as heck is not backin 'down from no challenge ,
and neither is calvin cambridge .
e excuse me .
take a number , ox ,
because you're about to be served .
they just don't make these things for ... normal sized people , you know?
that's gotta hurt .
go on ahead and laugh if you want , but you guys won't be laughing when i get 5 new jerseys from the family who's gonna adopt me .
you ain't gettin 'adopted .
yes , i will , 'cause i have a destiny .
all orphans are special .
all orphans have destinies .
maybe in books , but you wanna name a real one?
moses .
and nelson mandela and marilyn monroe and daunte culpepper .
who plays in the nfl .
this calls for champagne .
man ...
i want a family like that to adopt me .
look how they just get along with each other .
that's what i really want .
oh , man , why'd you do that?
all right .
kids ...
let's get to work .
murph : fresh candy .
reg : please?
right here .
hi .
would you like to buy some candy , ma'am?
hi .
what about you?
fresh candy . $2 . 00 .
hey , you guys wanna buy some candy?
if you don't buy , i don't eat .
hey , you want some candy?
reg : it's for the chesterfield group home .
candy bar , anybody?
can we have some candy?
please , daddy?
no .
we'll get treats inside .
girls , don't ever give money to a kid like this .
it's a big scam .
joad is down low !
he's open . !
tracy reynolds , you need to pass the ball !
but tracy shoots !
and it's nothin 'but ... rim .
and the knights lose by one .
what was tracy reynolds thinking?
no !
no !
man !
look at the coach .
he's on fiire !
let's go back to work , man .
go back to work?
nobody buys when we lose , murph .
man , you didn't even sell half your candy .
we could lose our tv privileges ... again .
is that coach wagner?
i think so .
s stay right here .
i'll be right back .
you have a good one .
thank you .
hey , coach .
bet you could use some candy after that one .
tough loss .
you shoulda seen it up close .
you had it won !
you diagrammed the perfect play !
sure , harrison didn't set the low pick , but why didn't tracy pass the ball?
son ... that is one for the ages .
hey , wait a minute .
it's 10 : 00 .
it's a school night .
do your parents know you're out this late?
i'm an orphan .
and i'm out here selling candy so that i can raise money for the group home .
oh .
well ...
listen , how 'bout this , uh ... will that get me a chocolate bar?
no .
i can't charge you , coach .
i don't even know if the money really goes to the ... to the group home .
what's your name , son?
my name is calvin .
calvin cambridge .
calvin , have you ever seen the knights play in the arena?
no , sir .
well , since you won't take my money , how about if i get you some tickets for sunday's game?
really?
you can pick 'em up at will call .
i will !
thanks , coach .
nice talking to you .
murph !
hello .
good to see you .
there's , uh , children everywhere , so ...
he's so adorable .
i'm feelin 'good about this , y'all .
today's the day i'm gonna get adopted .
you ain't gettin 'adopted .
none of us are .
face it .
we're like dogs .
parents only want the puppies .
so much for me being special .
hey , things could change .
i mean , your destiny could be right here and you don't even know it .
calvin !
where are you going?
off to do that history homework you owe me since yesterday?
yes , sister theresa .
ok , murph , there is a winter coat here that's just right for you .
try it on .
sister theresa , do you know anything about these shoes right here?
i'm not sure .
it's a perfect fit .
well , the guy who dropped them off said they used to belong to some famous basketball player when he was a kid .
um ... which ... which basketball player?
uh ... you know , the ... the tall bald one .
mj .
murph , reg , come here , look .
look at the shoes .
mj .
mj?
mj?
it can't be .
michael jordan?

go .
do your homework .
it's gotta be !
michael jordan wore these sneakers , man .
did you say ...
michael jordan?
yeah .
i said michael jordan .
give 'em back .
they could be anybody's .
let me take a look .
no , man .
they're his , man .
yeah , how do you know they're not?
'cause no one ever gives us nothin 'good .
just abandoned junk that no one wants .
like us .
we're not junk .
well , i want 'em !
oh , yeah?
then go get 'em .
i want those sneakers .
murph !
murph !
hmm?
wake up !
i gotta get those sneakers .
suppose ox is right and they're not mj's .
they are mj's sneakers .
i know they are .
then we'll get 'em in the morning .
not in the morning .
not while ox is around .
besides , they'll get ruined in the rain .
i gotta get 'em now !
well , calvin , seems like a really great idea .
unh .
aah !
calvin , be careful !
don't fall !
ohh .
oh .
ohh !
whoa .
the tickets were there just like coach wagner said .
i can't believe we're gonna see a real nba game .
oh , me , neither .
how'd you get those tickets?
we just did .
i'm telling bittleman .
ox , you can rat on us to mr. b , but , uh , you'll miss the game , too .
yeah !
yeah !
he just dunked the ball !
he dunked the ball !
the knights have one more chance here to chip away at this lead before halftime .
they're not shooting well .
open at the wing is reynolds .
he puts it up ...
oh , no good .
oh , man .
reynolds misses another shot , and that's the end of the first half .
minnesota timberwolves out in front of the knights by 12 , and once again , the knights did not play very good basketball in the fiirst half .
hey , good half .
good half .
good half .
we're in great shape .
great shape .
we'll win it back .
yeah .
henderson , attaboy .

hey , those chalupas upped attendance by 4, 000 .
you're familiar with mr. granger , the man who owns the team?
i have a very good relationship with mr. granger .
he hasn't called me in 4 years .
he called this morning .
and he's ready to clean house if we don't put some asses in those seats .
hello , los angeles !

that was really nice .
that was really nice .
really?
thanks .

can't go that way .
i didn't know it was like that .
yeah , you didn't know it was like that?

tracy reynolds .
man , i play " d.
that's what i'm playing .
oh .
whoa .

i guess this would be a bad time for me to ask for your autograph , huh?
hi there !
oh .
playing a little checkers i see , huh?
error .
error .
i was about to win .
so , are you the man i see about calvin cambridge?
ok , let me get this straight ...
you guys want to have calvin play for the knights?
right .
why?
i been coaching 35 years .
this is the most ridiculous thing i've ever heard of .
well , you didn't see him play at halftime .
hey , coach .
hi ... again .
am i gonna be a knight?
he's 4 1/ 2 feet tall .
i know .
can you imagine the press we're gonna get?
look , coach , i know attendance is in the crapper , ok , and i'm not averse to using the word " gimmick " .
this is about making money .
i see .
and speaking of money ...
ah , yes , money .
mr. bittleman , i'm prepared to make you an offer of $5, 000 for a one day contract .
ah ... well .
uh , seeing that i'm calvin's guardian , uh ...
i do have to make certain that nobody takes advantage of him .
you mean except for you?
hey , i resent that .
uh , mr. bittleman , uh , perhaps , uh , perhaps , uh ... an extra 2, 500 might help ease your worries .
deal .
good .
i always knew that there was something special about calvin .
wow , man , you're on the knights .
i can't believe you're gonna get to play in the nba .
i still can't believe what happened to me yesterday .
whatever i wanted to do with the rock , i could do .
whatever i wanted to do on the court , i could do .
and there he was ...
tracy reynolds , nba superstar ... and i outplayed him .
yeah , man .
and you hit that " j. " fade away .
that was a swish .
that was a swish .
you alley ooped yourself off the backboard .
yeah , that was hot .
but ... how?
that's a good question .
i don't know .
all i know is that before i had these ...
sneakers .
i couldn't play like that if my life depended on it .
murph , hand me that ball .
man ... you're like some weird basketball cinderella .
yeah , and the clock's gonna strike midnight if somebody finds out .
wow , i wish i was going with you .
me , too .
we'll be rooting for you .
come on , let's go .
yeah .
hey , everybody .
hey , trace , you need to get your notebook out
'cause the kid is back to school you again .
ha ha ha .
your mama .
hey , tracy , look , i'm sorry about the other day .
no , no , no .
it's all right , little man .
no need to be sorry , all right?
you got lucky .
it's all right .
hey , i'm joad .
why don't you take the locker next to mine?
here's your uniform , calvin .
special ordered ... ofiicial shirt , shorts , socks , and sneakers .
uh , but i like my own sneakers .
oh ... ours aren't good enough for the kid .
no , it's nothing like that .
it's just that i play better in mine .
play?
you just have to look good .
what do you mean?
coach , may i please ask you a question?
sure .
coach , i have a lot of friends here tonight , and , uh ...
i was just wondering ... wondering , am i here to play ... or am i just here for show?
calvin , i'm gonna be straight with you .
you were hired tonight just to increase attendance , not to play .
man .
but ...
i saw the tape of that halftime show you put on .
you got some game .
i am honored to have you on my team .
thanks , coach .
you bet .
whoo . !
whoo . !
we've got a bigger than usual crowd tonight , and a lot of it is curiosity .
the knights have a brand new player .
he's 4 foot , 8 inch calvin cambridge , joining us straight from the playground of the chesterfield group home .
reggie , your reaction .
geoff , this is unprecedented .
i can't imagine what the knights players are thinking .
we'll see what happens .
we're gonna fiind out shortly .
both clubs are taking the court as we get ready for tonight's opening tip .
go knights !
what was that? !
admiral !
admiral !
the admiral just waved at me .
he just waved at me .
admiral !
hey ...
come on !
hey !
hey !
coach wagner of the knights has seen enough .
he wants and gets a time out .
let's go .
let's go .
good hustle , baby .
what?
come on , guys .
it's not funny .
now , offense , is there any play that's gonna work for us tonight?
i have an idea .
oh , man .
i've been watching , and they're vulnerable from the weak side , especially to a pick set away from the hoop .
why don't we run the give and give and go?
you mean the give and go?
no , see , they'll be expecting that .
have tracy feed the ball to henderson .
henderson's gonna feed the ball to joad .
joad's gonna pass it back to tracy .
as henderson sets the pick ,
tracy's gonna take the shot .
i like it .
oh , no .
no .
i'm not gonna run some play by some snotty nosed kid , man .
damn straight , coach .
fine .
henderson , you're out .
tracy , you take henderson's slot .
calvin , you take the shot .
what?
have you lost your mind?
you said i could play anybody i want .
yeah , well , i didn't mean him .
am i the coach or not?
you are .
for now .
can you believe it , reggie?
it looks like the kid's gonna play .
a rousing welcome for the man they came to see , the little fella , calvin cambridge , into the game for the knights .
calvin !
run the play !
what's he doin '?
run the play .
no .
would you just run the play?
time out !
white !
why'd you call time out?
uh ...
i gotta pee .
he's gotta pee .
calvin cambridge is calling for a bathroom break?
i guess when you gotta go , reggie , you gotta go .
yes !
the crowd is roaring .
that can mean just one thing .
that little guy , calvin cambridge , has taken care of business in the locker room and is back on the court .
he's done .
ladies and gentlemen , this kid's for real .
he can play some basketball .
## tied up , tied up ##
## you got me so ##
## you got me so ##
slam dunk over david robinson !
unbelievable !
12 seconds to go , the knights trail by 2 .
trying to find some way to actually come back and win this thing .
it's good !
the knights win !
am i a genius or what?
huh?
tell me i'm a genius !
this is the nba on nbc .
calvin cambridge , the 4 foot 8 dynamo , has now signed a lucrative contract with the knights .
and no wonder , after he led them to a come from behind win over the spurs with 27 points?
that kid was unbelievable .
did i just see the admiral saluting him at the end of the game?
you know , cambridge's contract makes him the youngest , and the shortest person ever to sign a deal with the nba .
he's lean , he's mean , he's 13 .
yeah , now all the kids are gonna be saying ,
i wanna be like calvin " .
well , i guarantee you one thing , this orphan will not be an orphan for long .
i can't believe you're going on the road with the knights .
can i fit in your suitcase?
hey , what about me?
bittleman .
hey , calvin , this is great .
well , uh , i'm proud of you .
listen , uh , when you're on the road , uh , people might want to adopt you .
but you should realize it's , uh , only because you're a celebrity now , and , uh , they're just after your money .
besides , your contract forbids it .
wait a minute .
forbids it?
oh , yeah .
didn't i tell you?
uh , i signed your contract as your guardian , so , um , as long as you're playing for the knights , that can't change .
hey , coach , check this out !
pretty good .
welcome to self hypnosis for the fearful flier .
during today's peaceful flight , you'll transport yourself into a state ...
tracy .
what?

yes , sister theresa .
reg , you have to help me , please .
i'm not helping you with your geometry .

good for you .
it doesn't do us any good .
murph .
congratulations .
go get adopted .
what's wrong with him?
what do you think?
i don't know .
bittleman told me that i couldn't get adopted .
and you believe bittleman?
his contract says nothing about adoption .
look , why would you send all of these people here?
calvin deserves a home .
you're only interested in making money off him .
look , with all due respect , coach wagner , child custody law is very complex .
mr. bittleman .
just because you signed his contract as his guardian ...
i'll call you back .
i'll call you back .
wait !
i'm not through talkin '...
yes , what is it , calvin?
you lied to me .
what are you talking about?
you told me no one can adopt me .
i never said that .
look , calvin , bear in mind i have cared for you way before you were rich or famous , and all of those people in there , the only reason that they're interested in you is because you're famous .
i'd like to see for myself .
well , that's fine .
i will , um ... make arrangements with the very best candidates .
what do you think about that , my big man?
we've been doing musical dinner theater now over 6 years . ...
in over 27 cities . ...
mm hmm .
no more hard knock life for you , calvin .
## the sun'll come out tomorrow ##

everything's perfect .
uh , everything's , uh , you know , uh ...

everything's goin 'real terrible right about now .
my best friend murph , he's mad at me .
bittleman lied to me .
he set up the worst parents in orphan history to come meet with me .
and then , on top of that ,
i have a geometry test tomorrow , and i hate geometry .
mmm .
all right , well , listen ,
i'm sure the right parents are gonna show up for you , ok?

when calvin cambridge comes to your town , you'd better watch out .
well , that was the fiinal word from gary " the glove " payton tonight after the seattle sonics battled it out with cambridge and the los angeles knights .
yeah , now you know what it feels like to be in the glove .
it's more like a mitten , gary .
the knights rallied around cambridge after that , and before it was all over , payton got the gate .
get him outta here , ref .
and kenny , how about the way
reynolds jumped in to protect cambridge?
how about that?
they're startin 'to come together , rich .
the team's gelling at this point , and with 3 games left in the season , they are only 2 wins away from their first ever trip to the play offs .
## take it to the top ##
## get your head in the game ##
## get your head in the game ##
## get up out your seats or you got no one to blame ##

bonuses .
ha ha .
contract renewals .
we'll all have jobs next year .
you two together ... this works .
come on .
let's go .
so you still haven't met any parents you liked?
i don't know .
nobody seems right .
maybe nobody seems right because you already met the right person .
what right person?
tracy .
tracy .
listen , murph ,
tracy can't even take care of himself .
you like him .
yeah , so?
that doesn't mean he wants to adopt me .
well , why don't you ask him?
listen , reg , murph ...
tracy's not big on families .
he doesn't even talk to his own dad .
i mean , how can you have a dad and not talk to him?
man , that's nuts .
it ain't cool .
can you do anything?
you're back again?
yeah , uh , i got a surprise for you .
somebody i want you to meet .
oh , ok .
i hope she's wearin 'a bikini .
nah , it's not a woman .
it's it's your number one fan .
well , it has to be a woman , right?
calvin , why'd you bring him here?
this is your dad .
you don't want to talk to him?
listen to me .
now stay out of my business and get him out of here .
now .
how could we lose to the bulls? !
we were out of synch , especially cambridge and reynolds .
what's the matter with you two?
this was your gimme .
now you have to beat the raptors or we're out , you got that?
we're gonna have to tighten it up , guys .
pull this thing together .
damn it !
all right , listen , cal ...
what's wrong?
i give up on ever finding somebody to adopt me .
well , i wouldn't do that just yet .
well , hello , calvin .
we've been waiting for you .

we're from bel air .
hoo ooh .
hmm?
what's the matter?
you've had something on your mind all night .
nah .

it's calvin , isn't it?
as we hit the end of the regular season , the big story is this weekend's showdown between the los angeles knights and the toronto raptors .
both teams need a victory to make the play offs .
man , this is personal .
it's play off time , and my job is to shut calvin cambridge down .
besides , what does a little kid know about the play offs?
for the knights to have any shot at winning this game ,
reynolds and cambridge better get back in synch , and cambridge better bring every weapon in his arsenal .
ha .
hey , man .
how you doing?
fine .
cool , cool , cool .
hey , i wanted to ask you , uh , is it true what you said about calvin's , uh , sneakers?

guard these with your life , all right?
i will .
good luck with the boyds .

here come the raptors again .
they're making it look easy on a breakaway .
slam dunk by vince carter .
the raptors are red hot in this one .
toronto already leading by 9 , and here they come again .
the question the knight fans are asking is " where the heck is calvin?

calvin cambridge has arrived .
the crowd reacting as he comes onto the court .
however , is it too late?
the knights are trailing by 21 points .
they have never been able to make up that kind of a defiicit .
calvin , where have you been?
i'm sorry , coach .
so am i.
nobody shows up after 3 quarters and plays .
sit on the bench .
wait a minute , coach .
you gotta play calvin .

play the kid .
we could still win , coach .
we can .
yeah !
yeah !
here come the knights .
geoff : lf i didn't see it with my own eyes ,
i wouldn't have believed it .
but they're just one point behind the raptors in this game .
we gotta steal the ball on the inbound play .
and if we don't get the steal , who do we foul?
they all shoot good free throws , coach .
well , we better get that steal .
ready?
break !
let's go .
the knights need a steal right here .
carter being guarded by cambridge .
he comes in with it .
and he's got the ball ...
it's stolen by cambridge . !
what a big play by the little guy !
time out !
break !
time out called by the knights .
oh , no .
what's the matter?
i'm done , trace .

it really wasn't me that was playing .
it was the sneakers .
tracy , the sneakers were magic .
now they're gone .
