really .
where are my car keys?
on the cupboard .
we didn't disturb them .
young adults still living with their parents
you don't love me .
of course we do , but we would think about it during 6 months .
5months passed already .
you still haven't make up your mind?
why would we live together?
i'm going to peking in six months .
if you would need less time to think about it ...
should i resign my job & live together with you in peking?
ok .
doesn't sound really enthusiastic .
sorry for not letting it appear .
but you know me .
it would be delightful if you would join me .
would you really appreciate it?
of course .
hi , stphane .
hi , mrs guetz .
that antique dealer is a goldmine .
i told you , didn't i?
is lrne here?
yes , but things aren't that good .
what's wrong , lrne?
tell me please .
it's marc .
an accident?
yesterday night i heared ...
what?
he's stopping with hotel school .
he signed on as coccus .
he's putting out to sea sunday .
but he's still so young .
seventeen
children are so cruel .
you desire nothing of them & you give them all your love .
and then ...
i'll miss him so much .
that's the way it is with children .
not at that age .
he won't forget about you .
tanguy has teached me a beautiful chinese saying .
one day you call her mother & it remain like that the rest of her life .
strength .
thanks .
mrs guetz?
did i get any wiser , except knowing that i'm your advisor?
nothing .
they found something to remove the salt out of seawater .
yes , with electrodes .
not afraid of the competition?
i don't believe in it .
just like reverse osmosis .
only interesting for filter manufacturers .
is your pekingese still about to leave?
don't call him pekingese .
it's a pet name .
he's going to pekin , right?
in june .
yes .
so i can call him pekingese?
if you want to .
i can't remember .
is he 26 or 27?
i'm getting old i think .
i just can't seem to remember that .
28 .
that old?
he looks fine .
really fine .
you got try it .
why are you looking at me like that?
is it normal that he's still at home?
you're blathering .
of course i am .
the years are passing by .
he's still living home .
he's studying .
when you're not a genie nowadays , you're going straight to the dole .
no , the stats are good .
3 million unemployed persons when he left school .
accurate sciences , philosophy , japanese & chinese .
if he's unemployed , the whole mankind is .
he's graduating in june & starts in peking in september .
don't cheer too fast .
you already know about something?
a child that's being born 13 days to late , doesn't get away just like that .
says enough .
you don't have to be engineer to understand that .
mom , i'm engineer .
setting aside ...
the ease , the advangtages .
we already know about that .
and you broke the taboo .
he's taking " beings " with him .
that's the way it goes nowadays .
and i can keep an eye on it .
well , he's not leaving yet .
did you already make a choice?
the pekingese .
did you choose?
no .
if you talk about the rise of the subjectivity in the old china ... we can have the impression that the chinese way of thinking can become westernised ... by the concepts of the reproduction of the reality .
it's more about the reality within a subject ... in the metaphysical meaning , that can act , think , laugh .
excellent , tanguy .
sir?
no , sorry .
it's much too late .
why isn't this happening to me?
i can't stop crying anymore .
i'm a monster .
but i can't handle it anymore .
it's not abnormal , that u become a little impatient ... because your son of 28 can't take care of himself .
when he'll enter , my stomach is going to curl up ... and i will slap him .
is that normal?
of course , your impatience expresses itself in this agressivity .
it's absolutely not hidious .
30 15 .
ready?
second ace , 40 15 .
are you laughing with us?
not at all .
come with your projectile .
game .
damned , can't be true .
adrien , leave your brother alone .
go play further .
it would do them good if you wouldn't become so enraged .
and you too .
and us .
come on , philippe .
you played well .
it's only a game .
and?
6 3 , 6 2 .
thanks to your dad , with his service .
you didn't grow a lot .
he eats a lot nevertheless .
i must leave .
please stay .
you look bad .
haven't got the time .
i gotta go to the ministry .
on saturday?
a job as teacher , your exchange , & advisor of the minister .
you'll be independent once .
you're the advisor of the minister?
emmediately from final exam to pension .
see you later .
you're eating at home?
i'll see you later .
you'll be disappointed when he leaves .
i'm already preparing for that .
don't talk like that .
it was a joke .
there's always something serious behind every joke .
that's true .
don't touch him .
stop teasing her like that .
speaking about the devil ...
did you already eat?
n0 .
get a plate .
several things are available .
half an hour .
i can't find them louis xlv .
he ruled for 54years .
goes without saying that there are several models .
yes , but when i hear lous xlv , i think of ...
i don't know ...
versailles .
that's where they come from .
changed under louis vl .
well yeah , i don't want them anymore .
i don't know ...
how do you say that?
how are the mirrors of the gallery?
i don't know .
but i'll pass for a moment .
you're an angel .
what had you in mind for the nursery's?
straw .
joke .
where's the paper?
mr delerme?
i need your advice .
i'm listening . ... therapeutically cloning with embryo's ...
cloning ... to treat certain diseases .
this was started by the birth ...
good evening , mom .
hello , darling .
did you steal two bottles of gruault larose?
o , maybe when i went seeing lucas .
i just took something .
therefore .
are you eating at home?
i'm not that hungry .
i'll eat later on .
something's wrong?
i need to talk to you .
didn't we tell eachother everything?
always .
tell me honestly what u think of it .
i have to submit my doctoral thesis in june .
tomorrow it's june .
unfortunately , i underestimated it .
the farther you come , the heavier it seems to be .
i won't make it .
i talked with my companion .
he said i had to report it absolutely .
won't that cost your job in peking?
yes , peking .
i called .
they are detaining him for me .
according to delerme , impatience would be disastrous now .
it will be something more than a year .
it would be stupid to ruin everything now that i'm doing well .
but be honest , mom & dad , what do u think of it?
so you're postponing your thesis for one and a half year and you're staying home for all that time?
so you have enough of me?
not at all .
why are you acting like this?
it was a joke .
i don't think it was funny .
28 or 30 years , what does it matter?
proust stayed at home untill it was 35 .
your mother will tell you .
if you're father agrees , i don't see any drawback .
everything ok , darling?
edith?
something's wrong?
no , nothing .
sorry , i was dreaming .
come on girls .
six times to and fro .
push on your legs , stretch your legs .
sarah , you're keeping your head under water .
come on , keep on .
i'm laughing my ass off .
i don't see what's funny .
i'm only finding that i was right once again .
he will stay home for years .
no one year .
like every year .
does he have to forget his thesis to prove you're wrong?
do u know what he will be doing in one and a half year?
the same as always .
he'll have enough of that chinese stuff and will look for new things ... and will stay at home untill 2020 .
good evening , edith , paul .
miss .
philippe gildas , my mother .
we already met before .
what happened to you?
i bumped myself .
everything ok withtanguy?
irremovable , like always .
excuse me .
they are waiting for me .
he'll never change .
don't change the subject .
he'll leave when his thesis is done .
you should have rent a flat for him long time ago .
my child won't be a richman's child .
that's how you make a sponge out of him .
then he'll stay forever at your place .
if you want to quarrel about tanguy every day , you won't see us again .
cheers to the pekinese .
i don't want to lecture , but you are far too indulgent .
are you coming?
i can't handle it anymore .
what's wrong?
i checked about proust .
he didn't leave on his 35 .
his parents died , otherwise he would still have been there .
why are you saying that?
i can't handle it anymore , paul .
not another year .
one and a half year , two pregnancies .
it's getting too much for me .
say that again .
i'm a bad mother .
it's getting too much for me .
he's living here for already 28years .
what?
have i been speaking to the walls during all this years?
he's still living home , because you wanted it that way .
yes , it's my fault .
i was afraid he would leave .
but now i'm afraid he'll stay forever .
do you realise what's happening to us now?
don't make it worse than it already is .
still living home at that age , like if it is a hotel ... and his stuff lying around everywhere .
and bringing everybody over here .
and those girls he's bringing .
and he goes around with our friends .
his good manners , his smile .
his sweet voice .
and his damned thesis .
i can't stand him anymore .
it's obviously an overdosis .
he has to leave , paul .
when he's gone , he's the sweetest thing i have .
my flesh & blood .
but first he has to leave .
otherwise i'll be sick .
maybe your mother was right .
let's find a flat for him .
no .
he has to do that himself .
but he doesn't care about it .
no , no , no .
what are we going to do then?
the're must be a solution .
which one
he has to be discussed about it .
discussed?
if he doesn't feel well at home anymore , he will leave .
that's horrible .
you're making a mess of it .
look who's talking .
i'll resign & find a new job in peking .
and then i'll hear you're not leaving .
i will .
it will only be a little later .
so you're staying here & i'll wait there for you during 1 year?
you can also stay here , then we can think about living together .
in september for instance .
are you serious?
of course .
you're terrible .
but i love you .
one ice cube , one .
hi , dad .
have you seen my striped shirt?
no .
dustbin .
miss guetz , you tell us .
what will it be today?
beatiful coquilles .
it's time for it now .
what's that?
it smells good .
can i take your car , dad?
not tonight .
your mother & i may go out tonight .
yours then?
that one is in the garage
still?
yes .
that's ok .
good evening .
see it turns out better than expected?
use my bathroom in the meanwhile .
no , i don't want to be a burden .
come on , that would please me .
nathalie ...
can i say nathalie?
of course .
my wife told me good things about you .
nice .
doesn't happen often .
tanguy made a good choice this time .
don't tell me you know nothing about it?
tanguy hasn't explained anything?
come , i'll show you the bathroom .
you people are sick .
go examine yourself .
i was at the house warming of a friend recently .
nice parents .
but when i saw him in his flat , proud ... of going to the lauderette & preparing his own food ...
i felt sorry for him .
you're talking like a richman's son .
ok , i'm privileged .
but it's not about the material advantages .
why?
we were used to leave our parents home at quickly as possible .
mine are intelligent & big hearted .
they always let me do what i wanted to .
why should i give up on that?
i'm coming
i don't understand phil .
she's spoiling all my clothes .
aren't there any yoghurts anymore?
my mistake .
i didn't ask phil to buy themn .
doesn't matter .
have you been smoking weed?
ok , i'm off .
you go .
and don't come early at home .
i love you , mom .
you too , dad .
and i love you .
really?
really .
ok , put your desk in your livingroom .
i need the study room .
i'm going to do some sculpturing .
what do you guys have?
nothing .
buzz off now .
sculpturing , splendid .
i suddenly felt like it .
schour discs , 115 millimeter ...
for an electric drill?
and two titanium boortjes , 5 en 6 .
at the back of the store , lady .
excuse me .
do u know where i can find the hydrochloric acid?
second gangway on your left .
thank u .
damned .
am i making too much noise?
not at all .
something's wrong?
you didn't lose your job , did you?
a few pages , but that's ok .
as long as you're ok .
do you have enough room?
who kan manage on with a little , is prepared for everything .
how did you manage to do that?
that's my little secret .
damned .
tanguy , why didn't you tell anything about your rear light?
me?
yes , you .
i know of nothing .
don't lie .
we didn't educate you that way .
i really didn't do it .
you borrowed the car last night .
and now it's broken .
i didn't do anything .
sorry , but i didn't notice anything .
i'll pay for it .
you don't have to , but you have to look out for other people's things .
don't quarrel for a lamp .
i'll pay everything & won't touch your car anymore in the future .
so this won't happen again .
ok?
527 franc .
he doesn't cara a hoot about us .
or he's not normal .
don't blame me .
calm down now .
he doesn't care .
but let's not give up .
miss guetz , how are you?
did you liked it recently?
a lot .
give us the same again .
did i wake you?
it's ok , you know .
what's wrong?
i can't sleep .
why?
are you worried?
no , i just can't sleep .
take a sedative .
doesn't work with me .
shall i tell you a story?
i'm too old for that .
shall i make something to eat for you?
get a book .
i don't feel like reading .
i'm keeping you awake .
that's ok , dad .
do u have to get up early?
6 a . m .
then i'm leaving you alone now .
goodnight .
goodnight , dad .
strange smell .
i don't understand .
phil cleans everything up , but it's always coming back .
do u have an aspirine?
let me have a look .
don't you have something else?
asprin burns in my gullet .
what's wrong?
nothing , really .
who's starting?
come on .
we're listening .
raise your fingers then .
he who does nothing wrong & is honest ... and who doesn't know disasters .. and who's body & soul are intact ... and who are not being punished by god ... or by other people ... are called wise .
really good .
which local are you in wednesday?
204 .
your order & tickets to peking .
thank you .
i told you i was grateful .
i am , really .
noile sapin .
are you tanguy's mother?
i work at the dauphine .
you already met?
coffee or tea?
both .
this time i grabbed tanguy by his foot out of his cradle , his head hanging down .
i came up to a concrete stairs with sharp edges ... and his head hit every step .
i opened the door .
after that i began to rain .
i believe there were wolves too .
i got him in my head and throw him away . .
i quickly closed the door and when i came into his room ...
tanguy flew back like a boemerang .
and like always he fell into my arms .
with the neverending smile .
a dream is to give a release .
i have a patient with a daughter of 32 ages at home .
and she isn't as pretty as your son .
every night he dreams about cutting her up and burn her .
still , he isn't a monster .
how fun .
can i take a chair?
can't you see they're taken?
over there are plenty?
i'm sick and tired of always being nice .
why aren't you coming swimming?
you're way to tense .
i'm going crazy of that bitch with her fucking lude xlv door stools .
game , 3 1 .
that's normal , those balls are old .
new balls .
now we're gonna beat the crap out of you guys .
cannonballs , dad .
cannonballs , dad .
be honest , did you do it on purpose?
are yoout of your mind?
a couple of dislocated neckbones .
that collar has to stay on for 3 weeks .
u have a darn hard service .
he almost got paralised .
thank u.
do you play in competition?
i used to .
i'm sorry , chap .
you didn't do it on purpose .
it's not your fault .
margurite , how nice .
i thought you were mad at tanguy .
mad?
did he say that?
no , but he often takes friends along , i thought he was ...
silly of me of course .
if i get lucky , he'll never forgive me .
you are looking upset?
mom , it wasn't your fault .
it's my fault .
no , it was inevitable .
you even did me a service .
i love margurite , but she's been nagging for months about moving in together ... and having children .
no way?
i lead her on , but i kept getting tangled in .
i didn't know how to talk myself out of it .
maybe this is life .
of course this is life .
want me to ring her? saying it was a joke?
u think i want a some sort of forced up love?
no , thanks to you i got my dignity back .
i can't take it anymore .
he's off to china , we are taking a vacation and after we'll see .
thanks for taking me , dad .

wat is het?
kao liang , the saviour of peking .
during the ming dynastie general liou had a wall built .
one day all the sources in town dried out .
in those days there lived a dragonking and a woman .
the let the sources drie out out of revenge .
nobody dared fight the dragons ... but kao lang volunteered .
the general ordered him to find some elder people ...
because they were the dragons ..
he had to drill the 2 watercases on their car .
the dragons would be furious .
when it was done he had to drive back to peking
but he could nt look back before he had rode a hundred passes .
i m boring you guys .
no , it s fascinating .
he saddled up his best horse and went to look for the old couple .
he did what the general told him to do and drilled the barrels of water
it looked like an armu rushed forward to him .
kao liang rode of and forgot to count .
but unfortunately he looked back after 99 passes .
he got washed away by the water , but all the sources ran again .
and thanks to him alle the people never ran out of water .
kinda like you , dad .
it s a nice story .
is it ok if i rest for a moment .

there is only one solution .
we find him a flat .
over my dead body .
only fools never reconsider
but if he doesn t wants to?
i live to see that .
you il need your rest .
then we won t be on your case anymore .

philomne could do your house and you can come by every day .
this remains your home .

for who the brought so many sacrifices .
imagine the grief & despair of my client .
his parents who are the most precious to him of them all who chase him away ...
we ve always been very thoughtful , tolerant openminded en honest .
and what do you get , all for nothing .

i don t understan their hate .
i never hid anything from them .
i love them .
i feal at home with them .
they only have good qualities except the fact that they use drugs .

yes , they learned me to smoke weed .
better then go to a dealer .
husbands commit themselves to marriage ... to raise their children , to keep and to feed .
he makes 25 . 000 franc a month .
the side income of a student don t count as an income .
if you earned the minimum you would probably be right ...
but since your income , artikel 203 is in advantage of my client .
u reached the shortest end .

with artikel 203 u are finished .
i ve been saying that for days .
since '92 there were 8000 cases like this in france .
plus the ones in germany , italy en spain .
most of the time the children are always in their right .
u have to support him , not to keep him in your house .
at least that s something .
what s that?
a psychiatric report master lemoine gave me .
we il take our own professional that s fake .
that will take some time , you il have to keep him in the house .
i shouldn t be saying this ... but i know a few people who can give him a beating .
that il teach him .
thanks your honour .
i don t think that s necessary .
i m sorry . shut up .
