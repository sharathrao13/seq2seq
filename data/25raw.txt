the japanese ambassador just arrived .
he should be up shortly .
thank you .
the japanese are stalling , henry .
you know that .
when nomura took over as ambassador ... ... l had some hopes of settling our differences .
but our meetings so far have been unproductive .
he brings me proposals , i offer compromises .
he brings me counterproposals , and so on .
i tell you , henry , nomura was sent here to buy time .
that's what he's doing , at our expense .
the president thinks he's ... ... a man we can trust and deal with .
mr. ambassador , we meet again .
it is always a pleasure .
i assume you know mr. stimson , the head of our war department .
oh , yes , of course .
mr. ambassador .
i do hope , mr. stimson ... ... your presence here doesn't indicate anything ominous .
of course not , mr. nomura .
mr. nomura , won't you please sit down?
thank you .
well , since our last talk a week ago ... ... l have received a certain ... ... shall we say ... ... question from my government ... ... to put to you to clarify certain matters .
good morning , colonel .
there it is .
this machine lets us intercept every word between tokyo ... ... and all japanese embassies .
the coded material is fed into that machine .
it goes round and round in there ... ... and comes out here , decoded in japanese .
all we have to do is translate it .
we decode this quicker than the japanese embassy ... ... right here in washington .
no wonder you decided to call it " operation magic .
the latest intercept , sir .
thank you .
things are getting a little hotter in the pacific .
as long as we're sharing this assignment ... ... take a look at this .
behold the 1 2 apostles .
the chosen few are authorized to see the magic intercepts .
hap arnold , chief of the air corps , isn't on the list .
no , and not one of our overseas commanders .
stand by .
execute .
look at that entrance to the harbor .
sink one good sized ship in the channel and you've bottled up our whole fleet .
you know as well as i do , this harbor is a mousetrap .
fleet should have stayed in san diego where it belongs .
i made the mistake to point that out to roosevelt .
we're expected to obey orders .
we're also expected to exercise our own good judgment .
i didn't ask for the job .
sorry , lkim , but this was my command , and it's become habit ... ... to worry about the security of the fleet .
the british , flying some old biplanes ... ... torpedoed and sank three ltalian battleships at taranto .
harbor very much like this one .
i share your concern , but cno doesn't think it can happen here .
why not?
a torpedo dropped from a plane plunges ... ... to a depth of 75 feet or more before it levels off .
i know , and pearl is only 40 feet deep .
i'm still worried , lkim .
ten hut !
do the planes have to be parked like that?
way at the edge of the field .
standard dispersal procedure , general .
ln case of enemy air attack .
there are 130, 000 japanese on this island .
our main problem is sabotage .
it'd be too easy for enemies to sneak in at night ... ... and blow up every one of them if they're left out there .
make a note , fielder , we'll have to make changes .
ten hut .
admiral halsey's here to see you .
send him in , please .
blast me , break me , court marshal me , draw and quarter me ... ... if you think they're gonna send my ships ... ... on convoy duty in the atlantic .
lkim , i think they've gone nuts in washington .
how will i fight a task force if they send ... ... my ships to the atlantic?
that damn ocean is a swimming hole compared to the pacific .
what are we , a fighting fleet or these toy boats here ... ... so the japs can buy them at christmas?
all right , bill , now ease it off .
it's not just you .
they asked for some of our tankers too .
how do they expect to feed these wagons ... ... parked out here on this land locked duck pond?
you're still planning on rotating half of them at sea?
i was .
look , lkim , you've got to make them understand what's going on out here .
i'm gonna do everything i can , bill .
even go to the president .
by god , i knew there was at least one man ... ... in this man's navy who hadn't gone nuts .
and we go on to say , " it should be noted that japan ... ... has never preceded hostile action by a declaration of war .
we believe it possible that a fast rated ... ... japanese carrier force may arrive in hawaii with no prior warning ... ... from our intelligence service .
the most favorable time to the enemy would be dawn .
he probably would employ a maximum of six carriers ... ... strike on a weekend .
we recommend that the air corps " i read it .
yes , sir .
i appreciate the work that you and general martin have put in .
these reports are very useful to general short and myself .
general martin , you don't pull any punches do you?
we recommend that the air corps ... ... maintain a thorough 360 degree search ... ... of the hawaiian area during daylight .
this will require a force of 180 b 1 7 airplanes .
we can't search the sea approaches ... ... unless we have the planes , sir .
one hundred and eighty b 1 7s?
for god's sakes , that's more than the number existing in the states .
it looks fine on paper , but that's not a paper fleet out there .
squadron from the enterprise .
bill halsey's working the tails off his men .
wish we had more like him .
makes the most of what he's got .
doesn't keep asking for the moon .
well , not one bomb anywhere in the target for the past hour .
your pilots can see it , i suppose .
who's next?
it's anderson , sir .
now , that's more like it .
maybe your boys finally get it .
i hope so , sir .
who's next?
lieutenant dickenson .
tell lieutenant dickenson for me ... ... he couldn't hit a bull in the butt with a bass fiddle .
yes , sir .
ten hut .
carry on .
carry on .
this it?
yes , sir .
our new radar .
it's a remarkable scientific achievement ... ... capable of spotting an intruder on the sea or in the air ... ... and at quite a range .
now , listen colonel , as you know , we're short on patrol planes .
we're gonna have to rely on this ... ... thing to detect the enemy .
general , radar should do the job .
what's it doing here , not set up?
we're about to truck it up that mountain .
that peak up there is the ideal spot to put our main radar post .
at that height , we'd be clear of all interference .
obviously .
but , sir , we can't get permission to put her up there .
permission?
from the national park service department of lnterior .
see , all of this belongs to the hawaiian national park .
the hawaiian national park?
yes , sir .
the wildlife preservation society is raising hell too .
and we can't get permission?
no , sir .
not unless we want to fight them .
fight them?
you're damn right we're gonna fight them .
now you make a note of that , fielder .
yes , sir .
wildlife preservation society .
it's no use , hal .
i spoke to general miles .
he took it up with general marshall .
the order stands .
the president is off the ultra list .
lncredible .
withholding information from the president .
security found a copy of an intercept in a waste basket at the white house .
truth is , the brass don't trust some men close to the president .
does anyone trust anyone anymore?
do you even trust your own wife?
do you?
come to think of it , i believe i do .
part two of no .
1390 , colonel .
tokyo to embassies in washington and berlin .
thank you , miss cave .
the japanese are moving south to occupy french lndo china .
this is big trouble .
yeah .
well , ultra list or not ... ... someone has to tell the president about this one .
therefore , we will impose a full embargo ... ... on all trade with japan .
we do not anticipate immediate hostile action by japan ... ... but you get this information ... ... so you may take appropriate precautionary measures .
appropriate precautionary measures .
what the hell does that mean?
now , this is signed jointly by general marshall and admiral stark .
until we know how the japanese will react , we're not gonna take chances .
we go on full alert .
yes , sir .
stark says they don't anticipate hostile action .
why send a warning at all?
damn it .
damn it , why can't washington give us the full inside story?
i'd sooner form my own opinion .
don't anticipate hostile action .
well , all right , we'll go ahead .
lncrease air and sub patrols , alert senior commanders .
maybe out of this we can find out how well we can function .
lkaminsky .
this is captain earle .
going on full alert .
yes , captain .
we're going on full alert .
notify all ship , sub and air patrols .
what the hell is going on here?
what are you doing?
carrying out orders .
general short's concern is sabotage .
all aircraft not ready for flight from now on ... ... will be parked in the center ... ... so they can be kept under guard .
suppose there's an air raid .
they hit one plane , and it all goes up in flames .
i'm sorry .
general's orders .
it's not an ideal radar sight , but at least we got a permit .
let's get the other units working .
easier said than done .
what do you mean?
we have to get all six units adjusted and link them by phone to headquarters .
that means training men to operate an information center ... ... so they know what to do with the information .
take it easy , murph .
you'll figure it out .
yeah , i'll figure it out .
don't just stand there .
you know how to operate this thing .
we know the theory .
let's put that theory into practice .
switch on .
yes , sir .
stay put and keep watching the screen .
ln two hours , close down .
i'll send a truck to pick you up .
excuse me , sir , but what are we watching for?
anything unusual .
any large blip coming from the sea .
colonel , if we do spot something , what do we do?
report it to headquarters , damn it .
how , sir?
what?
we haven't got a telephone , sir .
there's a gas station a mile down the road .
they must have a phone .
we got 183 combat planes on this base , general .
the way they're parked now , a one eyed monkey hanging from a balloon ... ... could scatter them to hell with one hand grenade .
don't blame me .
general short gave the order .
come in .
sir , lieutenants taylor and welch .
okay , send them in .
you two men get in your planes and fly over to haleiwa .
yes , sir .
what are our orders when we get there?
just sit tight .
listen for the phone .
that's all .
yes , sir .
haleiwa is one of the subsidiary fields .
we send those two up there , two more here .
only way i know to disperse a few of the planes .
lf i'd get away with it , i'd send all to the neighbor islands .
you know why we're being transferred .
them poker games .
been winning too often .
some sucker loses his shirt , so he bitches to the general .
nomura has offered his resignation several times .
but tokyo won't let him quit .
lnstead they're sending a second ambassador , lkurusu , to help him out .
do you really think this lkurusu can do any good?
well , i doubt it , frank .
he's hardly the most tactful choice .
when he was ambassador in berlin ... ... he signed the axis pact on behalf of japan .
you sick or something?
no .
i've been piecing together this batch of new intercepts .
a frightening picture is taking shape .
ambassadors nomura and lkurusu asked their government ... ... to extend a deadline for suspending negotiation between japan and america .
you remember that?
yeah .
now , according to this latest intercept ... ... tokyo wants to conclude negotiations with us ... ... no later than november 29 ... ... after which , and i quote ... ... " things are automatically going to happen .
look at this intelligence report from the british .
five japanese troop transports with naval escort ... ... were sighted off formosa , heading south .
we've been monitoring their fleet .
most of it seems to be on home waters .
i'm not so sure .
i'm betting they're going to attack us .
japan is going to attack us .
the 29th is only four days off .
the 30th is on a sunday .
we're gonna be attacked on sunday , the 30th of november .
the pieces fit together .
but can you prove it?
no .
but i'm convinced i'm right .
miss cave?
get me general marshall .
general marshall's at fort benning , sir .
then get me the secretary of war .
i've got the evidence , al .
and i'm gonna make the brass around here admit i'm right .
bratton's analysis makes sense .
his facts are undeniable .
henry , i'm washing my hands of the whole matter .
from now on , it's in your hands ... ... and in those of the navy department .
i'll call the president .
a message declaring a full alert will be sent out .
general marshall anticipated an emergency like this .
before he left to attend maneuvers ... ... he made out this alert order .
read this back to me .
japanese future action unpredictable .
but hostile action possible at any moment .
lf hostilities cannot be avoided ... ... the united states desires that japan commit the first overt act .
read that again .
lf hostilities cannot be avoided , the united states desires ... ... that japan commit the first overt act .
this shouldn't be construed as restricting you ... ... to a course of action jeopardizing your defense .
prior to hostile japanese action ... ... you are directed to undertake reconnaissance ... ... and other measures as you deem necessary .
these measures should be carried out ... ... so as not to alarm the civil population ... ... or disclose intent .
by order of general george c. marshall .
not to alarm the civil population .
what do you make of it?
lf you ask me , sir , it's double talk .
but the chief of staff doesn't go in for double talk .
we're going on alert .
again?
but the men are confused .
so many alerts .
damn it , unconfuse them .
yes , sir .
japanese forces may attack the philippines ... ... thailand , the lkra peninsula and borneo .
this dispatch is to be considered a war warning .
well , there it is , gentlemen .
you now have as much information as i do .
that's the second warning in three days .
japanese forces may attack the philippines ... ... thailand , the lkra peninsula and borneo .
they don't mention us .
that's correct .
i think it should be considered significant .
well , gentlemen ... ... we have a job to do .
washington wants us to send a squadron of fighters to midway .
and another squadron to wake .
when can you sail?
well , the enterprise can sail tomorrow morning .
i'll need a day or two .
we're just completing repairs on the lexington .
hurry things along , john .
i want you out there to probe .
i want planes up in the air morning and afternoon .
i want a report on any sign of hostile ships .
understood .
do you want battleships along?
hell , no .
they're too slow .
lf we're gonna probe , let's probe .
we don't want anything holding us up .
you're right , but i'm not ready to commit them myself .
not until i know when and where .
do you plan to keep half the fleet at sea while the carriers are gone?
no , it's too risky .
i'll have to keep the fleet here at pearl while you're away .
get out .
get back as soon as you can .
i don't like the idea of having my battleships without air cover .
let's get going .
yes , sir .
lkimmel .
level with me .
i want a clear directive .
lf i run into a jap ship , what action do i take?
use your common sense .
that's the best damn order i ever had .
lf i see so much as a sampan there ... ... l'll blow it out of the water .
what is it this time , getting me over here?
tokyo has alerted their embassy to stand by ... ... for a very long message in 14 parts .
look , rufe , you scared me and everybody else last week .
we're not doing that again , are we?
you should see this .
it's the latest report on those japanese troop transports .
remember those troop ships?
they're still heading south with an escort ... ... only 14 hours from the coast of malaya .
what about their aircraft carriers?
we don't know .
lntelligence was keeping track of them until recently .
now we've lost them .
look , rufe , try to put yourself in their minds .
where do you think i have been the past week , night and day?
i am still convinced they're going to attack us .
what can we do that we aren't doing already?
i don't know about you , but i know what i'm gonna do .
where is everybody?
oh , it's past 1 2 , sir .
they've already gone .
get them back .
on the weekend?
yes , on the weekend .
this completes 13 parts?
yes , tokyo is holding the final part till morning .
i wonder why .
it's almost 9 .
harry , i'm going to make the rounds with what we have here .
thank god the president's back on the list .
have brotherhood call me when the missing part is in .
right .
you're late .
well , i was  please , take me to the white house .
lf you told me we were invited to the white house , i would've dressed .
you know mrs. roosevelt .
she's informal personally , but a stickler for protocol
darling , will you shut up and drive?
well?
captain wilkinson's .
did you see the president?
no , i saw harry hopkins .
and did he read the , whatever it is?
no , he doesn't have the key .
i gave the pouch to our naval aide , lt. schulz .
he took it in to the president .
and the president has a key , i suppose?
of course he has .
and did lieutenant schulz say anything?
he said , " thank you .
darling , step on it , will you?
admiral stark can't be reached .
should i take it to chief of staff?
it's after 10 , general marshall always retires early .
i see no reason to disturb marshall with something that's incomplete .
wait till you have the final part .
yes , sir .
lf you're so concerned ... ... why don't we call chief of war plans , admiral turner?
his telephone doesn't answer , sir .
you don't happen to know where he is?
no idea .
the president has already discussed it with me .
he sent a personal message to the emperor .
but when the final part of this comes in , i'd like to see it then .
good night , commander .
good night , sir .
i was starved .
i'll bet you are .
oh , thank you , dear .
can't you tell me anything?
even a hint?
you'd think the world was falling apart .
admiral stark talked to the president .
what did the president say?
he sent a personal message to the emperor .
gordy .
we got those b 1 7s coming in from california in the morning .
honolulu radio will stay on the air all night ... ... so the planes can home in .
you and i had better be in that control tower at 7 : 30 sharp .
yes , sir .
tyler , i've got a job for you .
sir .

lkramer .

1 p . m .?
precisely 1 p . m . , your time .
i'll be right over .
look at the president's message .
i should have had it hours ago .
as you know , communications have been delayed ... ... and frequently garbled lately .
or deliberately interfered with .
gene , call the foreign minister .
tell him i want an immediate audience with the emperor .
after deciphering ... ... part 14 ... ... destroy at once ... ... your cipher machine ... ... all codes ... ... and secret documents .
translate this immediately .
give a copy to lkramer when he comes .

i've got to get the hell out of here .
hey , look at this .

yes , colonel bratton .
i'm sorry , sir , the general isn't here .
where he always is this time sunday morning .
where's colonel bratton?
gone to see general marshall .
he left this for you , sir .
the 14th part of this intercept lkramer ... ... just delivered indicates to me the japanese are going to attack .
we know war is coming .
we know they have an expeditionary force heading south .
sir , as hostilities seem imminent ... ... l recommend you telephone admiral lkimmel ... ... in hawaii .
no .
i better call the president first .
now , if you'll all please excuse me?
yes , sir .
thanks .
the japanese government regrets to have to notify ... ... the american government ... ... that , in view of the attitude of the american government ... ... it is impossible to reach ... ... an agreement through negotiations .
there are supplemental messages .
thank you .
gentlemen , i am convinced the japanese intend to attack ... ... at or shortly after 1 : 00 today .
i'll alert all pacific commands .
yes , sir .
colonel bratton , just a minute .
take this to communications center .
come in .
captain , can you come to the bridge?
very well .
sub contact , mr. goepner?
we're not sure .
what ship?
the navy tug antares .
look astern of her , captain .
she's towing a target raft .
look between the ship and the raft , sir .
that , mr. goepner , is a submarine .
she's sneaking through the net into the harbor .
general quarters .
sound general quarters .
all engines ahead , full .
come left , 1 5 degrees .
come left 1 5 degrees , sir .
tell antares we're attacking .
aye , aye , sir .

aye , aye , sir .
captain earle speaking .
we have a message from the ward .
all right , read it to me .
have dropped depth charges on sub operating in our security zone .
we've had so many of these false sightings , lkaminsky .
but this is the real thing , sir .
closer than any previous sighting .
just off the harbor entrance .
you and i know the skipper of that destroyer is a green kid .
i'll pass it to admiral block .
with all do respect , sir , i think we should alert all commanders .
confirmation , lkaminsky .
i want confirmation .
this is hot .
general marshall wants it sent to all commanders by the fastest route .
right .
the general's handwriting : it's hard to read .
you're gonna have to help me with it , rufe .
major , i picked up some great music from honolulu .
that's fine , pipe it through .
where's the damn chow truck?
shut the thing down , george .
it's already after 7 .
hey , joe , come here .
what do you make of that?
i've been watching it for minutes .
it's moving in , fast .
i've never seen anything that big .
looks like two main pulses .
hey , joe , i got it .
i make that about 140 miles north , three degrees east .
don't make sense , we got no planes out that far .
we gotta contact the information center .
our problem is over at 7 : 00 .
the center might make some sense out of it .
okay , suit yourself .
lnformation center .
i don't know , mac , we're all closed down here .
ls that right?
hang on a minute .
lieutenant , sir .
lieutenant tyler .
sir , this is private elliot , opana point .
there's a large formation of planes coming in ... ... 140 miles , three degrees east .
well , don't worry about it .
the boys at opana point must have picked up the b 1 7s ... ... coming in from the mainland .
he said not to worry about it .
come on , let's go eat .
general , i sent this to manila , the canal zone and san francisco ... ... but the direct channel to hawaii is out .
atmospherics again?
yes , sir , it's real bad today .
we could give it to the navy .
what makes you think their atmospherics are better?
send it as a telegram .
yes , sir .
do you mean a submarine was cited over half an hour ago ... ... and that it's taken this long to report it to me?
i don't care if it still hasn't been confirmed .
i should've been informed after the ward radioed a first report .
a submarine that close is a serious matter .
a very serious matter .
get the confirmation or reports to my office .
i mean , right now .
have my driver get the car .
aye , aye , sir .
oh , sir ... ... should i tell general short you'll miss the golf date?
no , damn it , get my car .
a message for the general at fort shafter .
ls it marked urgent?
no .
it's a little bumpy , davey ... ... but you have to fly in all kinds of weather .
