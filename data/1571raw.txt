am i wrong?
no , you ain't wrong .
you know , in my own place ... my name ain't ratso .
i mean it just so happens that in my own place ... my name is enrico salvatore rizzo .
i can't say all that .
rico , then .
at least call me rico in my own goddamn place .
okay , rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
that enough for you?
that's fine .
give me a pillow .
come on , give me one of those pillows .
keep your meat hooks off my radio .
rico .
rico .
are you here again?
didn't i tell you once before to keep away from here?
every time you take stuff from me !
get out of here !
that ain't nice , pickin 'on a cripple !
cripple or not , i don't care !
who the hell do you think you are?
godamn it !
the two basic items necessary to sustain life ... are sunshine and coconut milk .
did you know that?
that's a fact .
in florida , you got a terrific amount of coconut trees there .
in fact , i think they even got 'em in the gas stations over there .
and ladies .
you know that in miami you got
are you listenin 'to me?
you got more ladies in miami ... than in any resort area in the country there .
i think per capita , on a given day , there's probably ... three hundred of 'em on the beach .
in fact , you can't even scratch yourself ... without getting a belly button up the old kazoo there .
it's hot .
let's go .
come on !
smells worse hot than it did cold .
all right , startin 'tomorrow you cook your own goddamn dinner ... or you get one of your rich park avenue ladies to cook for you .
look , i'm eatin 'it , see?
in her penthouse .
look , i'm eatin 'this shit , ratso .
mmm , good !
it's good .
i gotta get outta here .
i gotta get outta here .
miami beach , that's where you could score .
anybody can score there , even you .
in new york , no rich lady with any class at all buys that cowboy crap anymore .
they're laughin 'at you on the street .
ain't nobody laughin 'at me .
i seen 'em laughin 'at you , fella .
oh , what the hell do you know about women , anyway?
when's the last time you scored , boy?
that's the matter i only talk about that at confession .
we're not talkin 'about me now .
well , when'd you've been to confession?
that's between me and my confessor .
and i'll tell you another thing .
frankly , you're beginning to smell .
and for a stud in new york , that's a handicap .
don't talk to me about clean .
i've never seen you change your underwear once the whole time i've been here in new york .
that's pretty peculiar behavior .
i don't have to do that kind of thing in public .
i ain't got no need to expose myself .
no , i'll bet you don't !
i bet you ain't never even been laid !
how about that?
and you're gonna tell me what appeals to women .
i know enough to know that that great big dumb cowboy crap of yours ... don't appeal to nobody except every jacky on 42nd street !
that's faggot stuff !
if you wanna call it by its name , that's strictly for fags !
john wayne !
are you gonna tell me he's a fag?
i like the way i look .
it makes me feel good .
it does .
and women like me , goddammit !
hell , the only one thing i ever been good for is lovin '.
women go crazy for me .
that's a really true fact .
crazy annie , they had to send her away .
then how come you ain't scored once the whole time you've been in new york?
'cause i need management , goddammit !
'cause you stole $20 off of me !
that's why you're gonna stop crappin 'around about florida ... and get your skinny butt movin ', earn $20 worth of management ... which you owe me !
signora , a woman in your condition shouldn't have to do all this .
boy , you have a lot of laundry here .
well , it just ain't right cheatin 'from a pregnant lady .
what did it cost her?
what do you mean?
get outta here .
the laundry syndicate lost a couple of coins .
i'm cryin '.
that's it , sir .
all right .
sir , where's mine?
the black homburg .
i brought it in at the same time .
well , i tell you , i don't know .
you no have a hat here , mister .
you gotta bring me the ticket
what about that black homburg right up there?
up in there .
is that it right there?
a ticket?
here's my ticket .
it's right there on the corner .
you wanna get it , right over there?
i'll look 'em over .
keep goin '.
up to the top .
right in the corner there .
the top one .
no , it not belong to yours .
it belong somebody else .
hey , you're pretty damn good at that .
i bet you could make a livin 'at it if you try .
and end up a hunchback like my old man?
if you think i'm crippled , you should've caught him at the end of the day .
my old man spent 14 hours a day down in that subway .
he'd come home , two , three dollars 'worth of change ... stained with shoe polish .
stupid bastard coughed his lungs out from breathin 'in that wax all day .
even the faggot undertaker couldn't get his nails clean .
they had to bury him with gloves on .
okay , go ahead .
come on .
take a look .
don't rush me , boy .
gotta take your time here .
get myself primed up , like i was turnin 'on the charm ... for some pretty little blonde lady , you know?
then when i'm feelin 'cool and good ...
i spin around !
and there you are , you handsome devil you .
not bad .
not bad .
for a cowboy .
you're okay .
you're okay .
the lady will meet you in the lobby .
taxi !
yes , sir .
oh , i think you got somethin 'on your shoulder there .
there , you got it .
go ahead .
go ahead .
say , you haven't got a quarter , have you?
just a quarter?
how do you like that cheap bastard?
let's see what the hell you got here .
i think we struck gold .
this is one high class chick .
'barclay hotel for women . '

i'm calling for miss beecham ... at the barclay hotel .

she changed her mind .
she won't need nobody tonight .
that's right .
thank you very much .

i stole it for you !
the goddamn thing's ten sizes too big for me .
wear it yourself !
i wouldn't have it on my back .
i'll be goddamned if i'll wear it .

i hate boneyards .

he ain't your goddamn father !
he was even dumber than you .
he couldn't even write his own name .

my grandma , sally buck ... she died without lettin 'me know .
oh , hitler's storm troopers !
oh , hitler's storm troopers !
just because i happened to get out of a car !
would you believe that?
it all depends on what you believe in .
you know , like sometimes your spirit goes up , sometimes it goes
it goes other places .
how long did i hold up traffic just to get out?
i ask you .
give some people a little power , and they gotta supersede their authority .
this whole kind of thing is spiritual spiritual matters .
oh , now you're talkin 'priest talk .
you're talkin 'priest talk now .
i ain't talkin 'priest talk , i'm talkin 'about what people believe in .
some people believe you can come back in another body .
well , i hope i don't come back in your body .
i ain't asking you to come back in my body , but you can come back as anything .
you could come back as a a dog or a president .
if i had my choice , i'd come back as a president .
i ain't that dumb .
what do you think?
maybe you gotta think about those things for a while .
i'm usually not like this .
i'm usually a very calm and collected person .
really , forgive me .
i'm awfully sorry .
i think i'm gonna write a letter to the mayor .
i don't believe in any of that crap .
i mean you're entitled to think what you want .
maybe i do think what i want .
