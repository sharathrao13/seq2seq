you're looking good , dutch .
it's been a long time , general .
come on inside .
eighteen hours ago , we lost a chopper ... carrying a cabinet minister and his aide ... from this charming little country .
we've got a transponder fix on their position about here .
this cabinet minister ... does he always travel on the wrong side of the border?
apparently they strayed off course ... and we're fairly certain they're in guerrilla hands .
why don't you use the regular army?
what do you need us for?
'cause some damned fool accused you of being the best .
dillon !
you son of a bitch !
what's the matter?
the cla got you pushing too many pencils?
huh?
had enough?
make it easy on yourself , dutch .
ok !
ok , ok .
you never knew when to quit .
damn good to see you .
what's this fucking tie business?
come on .
forget about my tie .
i heard about that job you pulled in berlin .
very nice , dutch .
good old days .
the good old days .
why'd you pass on libya?
that wasn't my style .
you got no style .
you know that .
come on .
why did you pass?
we're a rescue team ... not assassins .
now , what do we got to do?
the cabinet minister's important to our scope of operations ... in this part of the world .
our friends are about to get squeezed .
we can't let that happen .
we need the best .
that's why you're here .
go on .
simple setup .
one day operation .
we pick up their trail , run 'em down ... grab those hostages , and cross the border ... before anybody knows we were there .
what do you mean , " we "?
i'm going in with you , dutch .
general , my team always works alone .
you know that .
we all have our orders , major .
once you reach your objective ...
dillon will evaluate the situation and take charge .

claims he has misery , but he has a lot of fun ...
oh , baby ...

delta one zero .
roger , team leader .
rendezvous points and radio freqs ... are indicated and fixed .
awacs contact on four hour intervals .
who's our backup?
no such thing , ol 'buddy .
this is a one way ticket .
once we cross that border , we're on our own .
this is getting better by the minute .
she's built sweet ...
she got everything that uncle john need ...
oh , baby ...
yeah , baby ...
whoo , baby ...
havin 'me some fun tonight ...

yeah , baby ...
whoo , baby ...

bunch of slack jawed faggots around here !
this stuff will make you a damn sexual tyrannosaurus ... just like me .

me and dutch both got one .
well , long tall sally , she's built sweet ...
she got everything that uncle john need ...
oh , baby ...

gonna have some fun tonight .
whoo ...
have some fun tonight ...
ok , bird two , prepare to cover me .
you got it , leader .
never knew how much i missed this , dutch .
you never were that smart .
hawkins , you're up .
lines away .
the pilots have each got one round in the head .
whoever hit it , stripped the shit out of it .
took him out with a heat seeker .
something else , major .
this is no ordinary army taxi .
it looks more like a surveillance bird to me .
pick up the trail yet?
billy's on it .
heat seeker , dillon .
that's pretty sophisticated for half assed mountain boys .
i guess they're getting better equipped every day .
there were 12 guerrillas .
they took the two men from the helicopter ... but there's something else .
what?
six men wearing us issued army boots .
they came in from the north ... and then they followed the guerrillas .
mean anything to you?
probably just another rebel patrol .
they operate in here all the time .
see what you can find .
yes , sir .
what's he got?
same business .
guerrillas hauling two guys in the chopper ... followed by men with american equipment .
do you remember afghanistan?
trying to forget it .
come on .
let's go .
oh !
god !
holy mother of god .
jim hopper .
mac , cut them down .
i knew these men .
green berets out of fort bragg .
what the hell were they doing here?
i don't know , dutch .
this is inhuman .
nobody told me there was an operation in this area .
they shouldn't have been here .
well , somebody sent them .
the guerrillas skinned them?
why did they skin them?
ain't no way for no soldier to die .
what happened here , billy?
strange , major .
there was a fire fight .
they were shooting in all directions .
can't believe jim hopper walked into an ambush .
i don't believe he did .
i can't find a single track .
just doesn't make sense .
what about the rest of hopper's men?
there's no sign , sir .
they never left here .
hell , it's like they just disappeared .
stick with the guerrilla trail .
let's get the hostages .
we move , five meter spread .
no sound .
it's time to let old painless out of the bag .
payback time .
you're ghostin 'us , mother fucker .
i don't care who you are back in the world .
you give our position one more time ...
i'll bleed you real quiet and leave you here .
got that?
aah !
fuck you .
aah !
he killed one of the hostages .
we move .
mac , blain ... the nest .
billy , poncho ... the guard .
hawkins , dillon ... backup .
once they're set , i hit the fuel dump .
one down .
what the hell's he doing?
what the fuck?
aaaah !
show time , kid .
target's the center , on the upper level !
dutch , on your nine !
get that mother !
go .
hyah !
stick around .
hostages are inside !
knock knock .
i got 'em !
hawkins , call in position and situation .
get connor for the hook !
you got it , major .
shit .
mac , any sign of the other hostage?
found the other guy .
he's dead , too ... and the kid from the chopper .
but if they're central american , i'm a goddamn chinaman .
from the looks of it , our cabinet minister was cla .
another thing , major .
we were lucky .
other guys we waxed ...
russian military advisers .
something pretty big was gonna happen here .
good work , mac .
clear the area .
no traces .
get the men ready to move .
right .
son of a bitch is dug in like an alabama tick .
you're hit .
you're bleeding , man .
i ain't got time to bleed .
oh ... ok .
you got time to duck?
this is goddamn beautiful .
goddamn jackpot .
this is more than we ever thought we'd get .
now we got those bastards .
we got 'em .
i think this is what you're looking for .
you set us up !
it's all bullshit !
all of it .
the cabinet minister , the whole business .
got us in here to do your dirty work .
we just stopped a major invasion .
in three days , they'd have crossed the border .
why us?
nobody else could've done it .
pissed about the cover story?
i needed it to get you in here .
what story did you hand hopper?
look , we've been looking for this place for months .
my men were in that chopper when it got hit !
hopper was supposed to get them .
he disappeared .
he didn't disappear .
he was skinned alive !
my orders were to get somebody to crack these bastards !
so you cooked up a story and dropped us in a meat grinder .
what happened to you , dillon?
you used to be somebody i could trust .
i woke up .
why don't you?
you're an asset ... an expendable asset ... and i used you to get the job done .
got it?
my men are not expendable .
and i don't do this kind of work .
major !
we stepped into some real shit here .
air surveillance says we got guerillas all over .
can't be more than one , two miles away .
how much time?
half hour , maybe less .
tell mac we move in five .
wait .
she goes , too .
she's got valuable information .
she'll give away our position any chance she gets .
no deal .
you're still under orders , major .
you wanna make that call or should l?
she's your baggage .
you fall behind , and you're on your own .
place is too hot for a pickup .
they won't touch us till we get over the border .
hey , billy , give me a way out of this hole .
aerial says we're cut off .
the only way out is that valley that leads east ... but i wouldn't wish that on a broke dick dog .
not much choice .
poncho , take lead .
double time it .
dillon !
dillon !
over here .
turn around .
why?
thanks .
anytime .
billy !
billy !
the other day , i was going down on my girlfriend ... and i said to her ...
jeez , you got a big pussy .
jeez , you got a big pussy .
she said , " why did you say that twice?
and i said , " i didn't .
see , it was because of the echo .
it was ....
ha ha ha !
ha ha ha ha !
over here .
over here .
over here .
turn around .
turn around .
ha ha ha ha !
turn around .
turn around .
over here .
ha ha ha ha !
anytime .
anytime .
goddamn .
whew .
buddy , buddy , buddy .
i've seen some bad ass bush before , but nothing like this .
i hear you .
this shit's something .
makes cambodia look like kansas .
que pasa , amigo?
a little taste off home .
you lose it here ... you're in a world of hurt .
come on , sweetheart .
stop sandbaggin 'it .
now get up .
come on , get up .
would you get up?
mierda !
ni lo intentes .
maybe you better put her on a leash , agent man .
try it again ... please .
callate .
what's got billy so spooked?
can't say , major .
been acting squirrelly all morning .
that damn nose of his ... it's weird .
what is it?
billy .
what the hell is wrong with you?
there's something in those trees .
do you see anything?
up there ahead .
nothing .
what do you think?
i guess it's nothing , major .
please !
please !
aah !
billy , break back .
back right .
what the ...
this isn't her blood .
what the hell did you do to him?
major , you better take a look at this .
did you find hawkins?
i ...
i can't tell .
what in god's name?
i think it's hawkins .
where the hell is his body?
there's no sign of it .
ask her what happened .
que paso , mujer?
mujer , que paso?
qu fue lo que viste?
quien fue?
yo no se .
dime , mujer !
quien fue?
dime !
la selva se lo llevo .
no estoy segura .
no se .
she says the jungle ... it just came alive and took him .
bullshit !
that's not what she said !
what she said doesn't make any sense .
those sappers followed us ...
hell , they've been ahead of us !
this woman's been running us right to 'em !
hold it !
why didn't they take his radio or his weapon?
why didn't she escape?
hopper .
what?
they did the same thing to jim hopper .
i want hawkins 'body found .
sweep pattern .
double back .
50 meters .
let's go .
come on in , you fuckers .
come on in .
old painless is waiting .
sergeant !
aaah !
mother fucker !
aaaah !
fucker !
mother fucker !
you mother fucker !
aah !
what happened?
i saw it .
you saw what?
i saw it .
blain .
no powder burns , no shrapnel .
the wound's all fused , cauterized .
what the hell could have done this to a man?
mac .
mac , look at me !
who did this?
i don't know , goddamn it .
i saw s something .
not a thing , not a fucking trace .
no blood , no bodies .
we hit nothing .
dillon ... better get on the radio .
mac .
sergeant !
yes , sir .
i want a defensive position above that ridge ... mined with everything we've got .
put him in his poncho .
take him with us .
i got him .
vamonos .
major ...
i set up flares , frags , and claymores .
nothing's coming near this place without tripping on something .
thank you , sergeant .
mac .
he was a good soldier .
he was , um ... my friend .
good bye , bro .
blazer one , i repeat , extraction necessary .
say again , blazer one .
say again .
request for extraction denied .
area is still compromised .
proceed to sector 3, 000 for prisoner extraction .
priority , out .
next contact 0930 .
roger , blazer one .
1030 hours .
damn bastards .
they say we're still in too far , and they can't risk coming in .
we're assets , dillon .
expendable assets .
it comes with the job .
i can accept it .
bullshit .
you're just like the rest of us .
shitload of good a chopper's gonna do us in here anyhow .
sergeant?
sergeant !
sergeant !
who hit us today?
i don't know .
i only saw one of them camouflaged .
he was there .
those eyes disappeared .
what was that?
those eyes , they ... they disappeared .
i know one thing , major .
i drew down and fired straight at it .
capped off 200 rounds in the minigun ...
full pack .
nothing ... nothing on this earth could have lived .
not at that range .
mac , you take first watch ... then you get some rest , ok?
ask her what she saw .
ask her what happened to hawkins .
go ahead , ask her .
qu pas hoy?
qu fue lo que viste?
te dijo lo que s .
fue la selva que se lo llev .
qu ms quiere que te diga?
same fucking thing .
the jungle , it came alive and took him .
billy , you know something .
what is it?
i'm scared , poncho .
bullshit .
you ain't afraid of no man .
there's something out there waiting for us ... and it ain't no man .
we're all gonna die .
the man's losing it .
he's losing his cool .
nothing but a couple guys running around .... and we gotta take 'em .
still don't understand , dillon , do you?
whatever it is out there , it killed hopper ... and now it wants us .
here we are again , bro ... just you and me .
same kind of moon , same kind of jungle .
real number ten night , remember?
whole platoon ... 32 men chopped into meat ... and we walk out , just you and me .
nobody else .
right on top of them .
not a scratch .
not a fucking scratch .
you know , whoever got you ... he'll come back again , and when he does ...
i'm going to cut your name right into him .
i'm going to cut your name into him .
what the hell is it?
mac !
where are you?
over here !
mac !
aah !
mac !
fuck !
mac , where are you?
mac , where are you?
jesus .
i got you , mother fucker .
i killed you , you fuck .
jesus , you killed a pig .
think you could have found something bigger?
fuck you , poncho .
fuck you .
where's the girl?
aw , shit !
why the hell wasn't anybody watching her?
why didn't she try to get away?
look at her .
she's scared out of her mind .
major , you better take a look at this .
blain's body , it's gone .
it came in through the tripwires .
took it right out from under our noses .
that boar had to set off a tripflare ... because there ain't no other tracks .
how could anyone get through this ... and carry out blain without us knowing it?
why didn't he try and kill one of us?
he came to get the body .
he's killing us one at a time .
like a hunter .
he's using the trees .
yesterday , what did you see?
you're wasting your time .
no more games .
i don't know what it was .
it ...
go on .
it changed colors like the chameleon .
it uses the jungle .
blain and hawkins were killed by a lizard?
that's a bullshit psych job .
there's 2 or 3 men out there .
fucking lizard !
what's your name?
anna .
anna , the thing is hunting us .
all of us .
you know that .
what the hell are you doing?
we'll need everyone .
i'm taking her back .
we leave in five minutes .
we're not going yet .
rendezvous is ten miles away .
you think the chopper's going to wait?
we make a stand now , or nobody will be left .
there is something else .
when the big man was killed , you must have wounded it .
its blood was on the leaves .
if it bleeds , we can kill it .
look out .
you really think this boy scout bullshit's gonna work?
it can see tripwires .
maybe it can't see this .
instead of complaining , maybe you should help .
what makes you think he'll come through here?
the trees have tripwires every 50 yards .
this is the only way in .
when i was little , we found a man .
he looked like ... like butchered .
the old women in the village crossed themselves ... and whispered crazy things , such strange things .
ei diablo , cazador de hombres .
only in the hottest years this happens .
and this year , it grows hot .
we begin finding our men .
we found them sometimes without their skin ... and sometimes much , much worse .
ei que hace trofeos de los hombres ... means " the demon who makes trophies of man .
what you gonna try next , cheese?
hey , dutch .
dutch !
shit !
aah !
i got you , you mother !
i got you !
i'm coming !
mac !
mac !
get ramirez to the chopper .
hold it .
i'm going after mac .
that's not your style , dillon .
i picked up bad habits from you .
get your people the hell out .
you can't win this , dillon .
maybe i can get even .
dillon .
just hold onto that damn chopper .
ohh !
ohh !
he's busted up pretty bad , major .
i can make it .
i can make it .
get the radio .
forget the rest .
ohh !

you work your way down there toward him .
i'll get in back of him , flush him toward you .
when i flush the son of a bitch , you nail him .
i got a score to settle .
we've both got scores to settle .
vamos !
vamos !
come on !
