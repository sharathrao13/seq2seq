no fun at home staring at the old bag .
come on , drink up .
take the boss home .
big boss , please .
what?
we're leaving already?
let him pass .
spoilsports .
too weak , sir?
too strong .
brother ... shouldn't we call a truce with the enemy?
you're getting soft .
can't be so headstrong .
we're not young anymore .
cops are already here .
dump it somewhere .
hope the boss went home .
and not to his mistress's .
why the fuck are you here?
that's how it is ... so might as well come to an agreement .
we don't want it to get out of hand .
better to disband the family .
he says he'll look after you .
goddamn it , this is a wake .
shit happens .
shit happens "?
what's with this tie?
back off , punk .
i have a wife and children ... and my men .
i cut off my finger .
so let me join the family that killed our boss .
please , brother?
don't " brother " me !
i don't want this !
i should kill you !
you traitor !
you call yourself a yakuza?
he's doing it for us .
please kill me instead .
please forgive us .
please .
you stay out of this .
sorry , brother .
never mind .
i'll talk to aniki for you .
well , see you .
aren't you ashamed of yourself?
you're out of line .
i declare this to mr. harada and the ten men who will become dependents .
as you drink the sacred sake before you ... you will become members of the hisamatsu family .
as you may already realize ... in the strict world of the yakuza ... even if your boss tells you white is black ... you must put aside all reservations and agree to his view .
damn hisamatsu .
why is he taking that bastard in?
i think the police pressured him .
there was no alternative .
this way , our enemy is finished .
aniki doesn't fit in .
it's like he's not needed .
'cause he's an outsider .
after all , you were enemies .
it can't be helped .
i've been told to kill you .
you're a pain in their ass ... and they don't trust me .
then kill me .
come on .
we're sworn brothers .
could you leave the country?
i'll take care of everything .
i could go to america .
my kid brother's there .
impossible for a yakuza?
brother , would you really go?
the chinese guys can make up a passport .
i'll get you some money too .
please .
i owe you one .
hey , i'm supposed to die .
who is he?
a bum named sakamoto .
let's see his face .
doesn't look anything like him .
hey , put these clothes on him .
destroy his face and hands .
burn his back .
and plant the driver's license on him .
yes , sir .

who the fuck does he think he is?
aniki's not good at things like this .
this?
fuck him .
these fucking guys want me to be a henchman .

i'll take it .
how are you doing?
how's brother yamamoto?
i've had troubles ... but i have my own family now .
i owe it all to him that i've come this far as an outsider .
that's some finger you had made .
with that on , you won't be thrown out of golf clubs .
excuse me , sir .
mr. harada and my boss sure are prosperous .
being an outsider , it wasn't easy .
because of your efforts ... we've grown bigger .
keep up the good work ... and no rivalry .
yes , sir .
but , boss .
since there's an outsider among us ... it's hard to tell what he's hiding inside him .
matsumoto , are you talking about me?
do you want to take a look at what's in my stomach?
bring me a knife !
yes , sir !
see for yourself .
take him away .
matsumoto , you tarnished this celebration .
i demand you take responsibility for this !
sorry , sir !
please forgive me with this .
the mafia is harassing us .
