the 3rd painting exhibition
growrich gallery
interesting?
not much , yes?
i liked it .
not interesting at all .
i thought it was fun .
we're right in front of kyongbokgoong palace .
our palaces are quite small .
shall we go?
where to?
how about lunch?
did we eat?
didn't we?
you can't remember whether you had lunch or not?
anyway , let's have something .
let's go .
you should start painting again .
what?
you should start painting again .
and what about you?
i have a studio and i go there once a week .
and your brother , why doesn't he trust you?
he thinks there's only one way to live , just his way .
nobody can get through to him .
i think i know what you mean .
no , you don't , youngsoo .
no one can get through to him .
even though you know he's wrong , it's no use , no use .
i know what you mean .
excuse me , the toilet .
what's the matter?
it's probably his stomach .
are you two close?
i've known him for about 5 years .
we don't get together often but we're fond of each other .
he's a very gentle person , this kid .
the way you talk about him , you seem very close .
what did i say?
i've never seen you be nice to someone for this long .
what are you trying to say?
what is her name?
soojung .
her last name?
yang .
can you please move?
we're shooting here .
thank you .
hello .
what a coincidence !
hello .
you must be here with the crew .
yes .
can i see those gloves?
these gloves?
these gloves are really mine .
how did you get them?
these gloves are yours?
i found them on that bench .
i came back but ...
i didn't think i would find them ...
i must have left them on the bench during lunch .
well , how lucky .
i can't believe that you , soojung , brought them to me .
you remember my name .
of course .
do you remember my name by any chance?
yes , of course .
i have a pretty good memory .
i have good memory , too .
well , i have to go .
it was nice meeting you again .
it was nice meeting you , too .
oh , i'm seeing youngsoo later on .
i see .
well , so long .
good bye .
and thank you for the gloves .
that's alright .
the independent way is the way to make the best films .
the industry way isn't right for me .
i'm ready to struggle .
then i can help out .
yes , of course .
but this is a bit embarrassing for me to talk about , isn't it?
you shouldn't be .
it would be good if you could help .
it would be great if i help out , right?
can you really?
just direct as well as you paint , okay?
it'll be great for me , too .
is this codfish?
no way .
codfish wouldn't be this cheap .
but isn't this place called cod house?
this is crayfish .
i have to go to the bathroom .
codfish isn't so cheap .
new chopsticks , please !
they're right here .
oh , there they are .
where did you get the chopsticks before?
from there .
let me pour for you .
do you drink a lot?
what?
drinking ... do you drink a lot?
yes .
i used to drink up to 5 bottles of soju , and 3 bottles of whiskey .
really?
you drink that much?
not anymore .
youngsoo , are you okay?
are you going to sadang dong?
youngsoo , get in .
be careful .
are you alright?
to sadang dong , please .
soojung , will you be alright?
i'll take you home .
i'm okay .
please go .
i'll take you home .
you are an odd one , aren't you?
i'll show you something funny .
come .
what is it?
i know it's really cold , but it'll be fun .
what is it i'll enjoy?
there's this strange guy who lives with this girl ... it's really funny .
come on .
they're not here .
you're really funny .
soojung ...
stop !
stop it !
i'm sorry .
are you hurt?
no ...
i don't know how you think about me , but i would really like to start a serious relationship .
but , we don't know each other well .
i'm really serious .
i'm not just saying this .
if you can trust me , maybe you could start a relationship with me .
i'm asking for the last time .
no .
i see .
then , i should apologize .
i'm sorry .
please forgive me .
i will .
thank you .
i'll return this right after i'm back from location scouting .
sure .
are you sure i can borrow this?
of course .
very nice ...
i should get one of these .
they're not available in korea .
i bought this in japan .
you go to japan , right youngsoo?
why would i go to japan?
hey , park !
if you're not going to shoot , why did we have to come so early in the morning and wait?
if you think editing will take more time , you should have at least given us a call .
we've been here waiting from the break of done .
i thought the editing would be over by then .
we have to leave early if we want to save a day .
you should know that .
you always end up spending 3 days to edit , and you know it .
and you still make us come so bloody early in the morning .
come on , tell me when you've taken less than 3 days , huh?
okay .
at least , buy us some lunch .
the crew have been waiting all day , you know .
let's do it next time .
i have visitors today .
it's 16 to 9 .
it's my serve .
oh , don't we have to check on the staff before they leave?
okay .
we can do that now .
let's quit playing .
you're good .
why did you say you're not good?
i'm not good .
this isn't funny .
why do you say you're not good when you are?
hello?
hello , is this park?
oh , kwon .
you didn't come back so i left .
i told your assistant before i left ...
i don't want to hear any of that .
so , are you coming tomorrow , or not?
i waited the whole day today .
besides , something's come up and i'm out of town tomorrow .
i don't care what your plans are .
are you coming tomorrow , or not?
we're shooting tomorrow .
are you gonna be here , or not?
what about driver kim?
why should he come?
he's the boss 'driver , not the driver for the crew .
why would he come?
you're really not up to this job .
why don't you just quit?
okay .
you're fired .
now you won't have to come tomorrow .
satisfied?
what?
you , son of a bitch .
what's that?
bastard .
you better not move an inch .
stay right there , you bastard .
i'm sorry .
i'm really sorry .
you know how it is .
we're always behind schedule .
so i was a bit tense , and i said some things i shouldn't have .
i'm really sorry .
let's shake hands and make up .
i'm sorry .
we don't have to shake hands ...
i'm really sorry , park .
my mistake .
i shouldn't have .
come on .
give me your hand .
is everything okay?
are you okay?
you know , one can't do everything one wants in life .
this is pretty heavy .
you carry the camera in your pocket?
i just put it in here a while ago .
how did it go with park?
well , you know ...
i was too thoughtless .
it's his job we're talking about .
it was my temper , but it was my mistake .
my fault .
so is he coming tomorrow?
oh , i forgot about that .
by the way , youngsoo , it only takes 30 minutes to recharge .
to sadang dong !
to sungbook dong .
yeah , you go .
soojung , get in .
i'll drop you off .
me?
no , i'm fine .
it's the opposite direction .
it's okay .
it'll only be a slight detour .
bye youngsoo .
get in .
get in .
bye .
bye , youngsoo .
how about if i be your girlfriend only when you drink?
would you?
i liked that .
did you like it?
i'll show you something .
when i was young , i used to stick my head out .
back then , my parents and i drove to the airport almost everyday .
on the way to the airport , my brother and i used to fool around ...
our car was a foreign car , too .
i guess we were well off , back then .
please , make yourself at home .
would you like something to drink?
no thank you .
are you sure?
yes .
excuse me while i take a shower .
would you like to take a shower?
no , thank you .
just a second .
this is my first time .
what?
i've never done this before .
really?
yes .
i've never done this before .
really?
i'm a virgin .
quite funny , isn't it?
no .
not at all .
isn't it funny?
you don't like to wear a bra?
i don't like to in the winter , because it's uncomfortable .
i see .
i guess in the winter , it doesn't show .
excuse me .
can i get you anything else?
i think we're okay .
so it seems you come often these days .
that's your car out there , right?
yes .
it's a very nice car .
well .
have a nice time .
it's just a fork .
i would if i had a girlfriend .
i think you're being too picky .
yeah , you're too picky .
it's not easy .
what's not easy?
well , you know .
i thought you were the simple type , but i guess not .
i guess i'm kind of chicken .
i think it's in our family blood .
then how did your older brother manage?
he and my sister in law go way back .
they met when she was in high school .
they went to the same church , and when she was in high school , he decided that she's the one .
so we can say that he raised a child , then gobbled her up .
what?
well , i think it's fate and ...
i'll take her .
come on .
i think she might have been offended .
what do you mean?
she also met her husband when she was in high school , remember?
oh , right .
and i said that he raised a child , then gobbled her up .
she must really be offended .
oh , no .
anyway , happy birthday .
thanks for coming .
come on .
we're in public .
to be frank , the type of woman that's attracted to you , would probably be half crazy or decadent .
but , what you need is a woman that's disciplined and secure .
that's why it is very hard to find a right woman for you .
that's enough .
no .
i mean it .
see , you wife here ...
someone's at the door .
i'll get it .
okay .
long time no see .
jaehoon , you're here .
hi .
the numbers of the apartment buildings are so mixed up .
come in .
come in .
she's a writer and works with me .
hello .
come on in .
how come it's so dark?
where are the lights?
in the back .
please sit down .
i've brought some baked sweet potatoes .
thank you .
so , it seems you've had quite a few drinks , already .
how have you been?
fine .
what about dinner?
this will do .
can you hand me the chopsticks .
try some of this .
youngsoo , how's your movie coming along?
going well?
fuck .
why do you always have to call me by my name , youngsoo , when you never call their names when you talk to them?
have you ever really cared about me?
soojung , come here .
come over here .
move over , damn it .
come on .
get over here .
pour a drink for your boss , the producer .
come on .
youngsoo !
i'm just kidding .
get away .
soojung .
loosen up .
just enjoy yourself .
you don't have to act so innocent .
drink up .
go with the flow .
drink up .
drink up .
drink up .
are you saying i didn't drink?
i did drink a lot .
you did?
okay , then i'll drink this .
this is for me?
he's a thief .
how can he steal his own friend's camera?
you don't know if he stole it?
he said he lost it .
what do you mean he lost it?
it's so obvious .
just because there's no proof , we can't just forget about it .
it's not obvious .
how funny .
how really funny .
soojung , so are you saying that he's not a thief?
we don't know .
how can you ... okay .
producer kwon made a mistake .
he drank too much tonight , and he was out of line .
let's just leave it at that .
are you saying that i'm accusing a completely innocent person?
i'm not talking about him being drunk tonight .
i'm talking about his integrity .
his integrity .
you know !
he was out of line because he doesn't know about us .
him not knowing has nothing to do with it .
what about him touching you , like your legs?
is that also because he didn't know about us?
stop it !
we didn't tell him , so it's our fault , too .
funny .
very funny .
an innocent mistake because he didn't know , huh !
soojung , are you in love with him or something?
how very funny , mister !
was it so wrong for me to ask you to keep our relationship a secret?
were you that offended?
how can you not know how i feel about you?
okay .
no , its not okay .
i don't want our relationship to be taken as a fling .
i don't want other people gossiping about us , either .
or him staring at us with a knowing eye .
this is really important to me .
you know?
our relationship is .
alright , okay .
let's just keep it between us .
soojung , you don't know what i really want .
i really want our relationship to be really meaningful .
i've never felt like this before .
i was even considering marriage .
even marriage ...
how can you not know how i feel?
me , to consider marriage .
do you know how hard it is for me to consider marriage?
for me to consider ...
don't make it difficult , then .
make your life easier .
let's stop seeing each other , then .
why should we see each other if it has to be so difficult?
am i wrong?
soojung !
come here .
come here .
come here .
enjoy your meal .
can i see you today?
i have to go somewhere today .
i see .
how are you?
okay .
are you going somewhere far?
no .
a friend has just moved to ansan , and invited some friends .
ansan?
where's ansan?
it's close if you take the subway .
she moved to kojan , which is right before ansan .
kojan?
do you know how to get to kojan?
look for yourself .
you look very nice in a skirt .
what is this?
beethoven's 6th symphony , " pastoral " .
oh , and thanks for this cd player .
not at all .
do you like it?
my mother asked me who gave this to me .
is that so?
i told her it was a gift , and she said it must be from someone who's very generous .
is that so?
is that how you hold your chopsticks?
why?
you're supposed to hold one still so it doesn't move .
then , hold the other one at the end of the three fingers .
like this?
you move them back and forth with these two fingers .
very good .
if you're not used to it yet , just do it your way , for now .
i should correct something if it's wrong .
no .
why not?
let's do it next time .
again?
i'm really getting tired of this .
let's do it next time .
next time , when?
this is all you want to do .
you got my breasts , didn't you?
i really want to do it .
let's do it next time .
not today .
i'm having my period .
period?
it doesn't matter .
i don't mind .
i do !
let's do it when i'm clean .
are you really having your period?
of course .
show me , then .
it's true !
let's go somewhere nice .
how about cheju island?
yes .
let's go to cheju island .
okay .
let's do it in the most expensive room in cheju island .
look at that grin .
soojung ...
i love you .
i love you , too .

the cable car has been suspended because of a power outage .
tell the passengers so they don't panic .
alright .
when will it work again?
we're calling the power utilities now so bear with us for a while .
we'll use the emergency engine if it takes too long .
i think the baby had a scare .
yes .
i think so .
sorry , but can you hold her for me .
<perhaps intentlon>
okay , see you later .
bye !
come here .
my baby .
sweet heart .
let's go .

no .
let's go see some paintings .
what's the matter?
paintings?
you mean a painting exhibit?
yeah .
now?
let's go .
i'll buy you a drink .
we're right in front of kyongbokgoong palace .
our palaces are quite small .
why should it be bigger?
sorry to keep you waiting .
kim , you can leave early today .
we're going to eat somewhere here , so i won't need a ride .
no , sir .
i'll wait .
i'll be waiting here , sir .
you will?
then get something to eat .
yes , sir .
shall we go?
okay .
let's go this way .
then why don't you move out of your brother's house .
get your own place .
youngsoo , i respect my brother .
he's a good person .
there's a lot to learn from him , in a practical way .
excuse me ...
i have to go to the toilet .
i guess he had too much to drink .
do you drink a lot?
excuse me?
drinking ... do you drink a lot?
yes .
i used to drink up to 5 bottles of soju , and 3 bottles of whiskey .
really?
you drink that much?
these days i can't handle that much .
