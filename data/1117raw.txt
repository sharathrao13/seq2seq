you know who would be perfect to direct this ... and it kills me to say it , because i don't relish the idea of working with him ...
but ... my ex husband .
val?
val's perfect .
he's perfect , given this material .
she's right .
this is his kinda story .
look , i love val .
i love him .
but with all due respect ...
he's a raving , incompetent psychotic .
he's not incompetent .
they should lock him up and throw away the key .
don't take that the wrong way .
forget it .
we're gonna wind up $20 million over budget , and maybe no picture to boot .
that's right .
i did a picture with him when i was at firestone .
he didn't even finish the movie .
i was there at firestone .
he had a nervous breakdown .
he was under a lot of stress .
we had just broken up ...
honey , he was fired off a picture here at galaxie just before i took over .
they said his demands were outrageous .
he's a perfectionist .
the light had to be perfect .
the sun had to be just right .
he demanded that they replace the leading lady .
he wanted to reshoot the dailies every other day .
he fired the cameraman .
finally , he came down with shingles .
they shut down the picture and found another director to finish it ...
you you don't have to tell me about that .
i was married to him at the time .
you should remember .
that was ten years ago , hal .
his best pictures were ten years ago .
then he became a real artiste .
look , look .
i am the last person to defend that craziness ... because it drove me nuts .
but val cares about movies , and he was born to do this material .
ellie , what are we discussing here?
shingles , headaches .
why open a can of worms?
but he's mellowed .
i'm telling you .
who better to direct this?
the streets of new york are in his marrow .
ruth .
yes , ruth .
no way !
god !
what about him?
he's great .
i know we could get him .
he'd be safe .
we can put our foot on his neck .
martin ruth .
that's true .
val hasn't worked in a lot of years .
we could make a good deal .
all you have to do is watch him like a hawk .
we're gonna lose ...
we're gonna lose a lot more with val .
i agree with ellie .
i think he's the ideal director for this project .
but we're not gonna use him .
who needs trouble?
right .
besides , what makes you think he'd want to work with us , given all the personal baggage?
i'm told that he's in no position to be fussy .
i can't stand it here .
what the hell am i doing in canada?
lori , they got moose up here .
moose .
are moose carnivorous?
my god !
how could you be homesick?
you got there yesterday .
you're coming home tomorrow .
val?
val , val , val .
we're good to go here .
waiting on you .
did my agent call?
any word on that tv movie?
the interracial abortion , gene splicing thing?
i think the tv movie decided to go with peter bogdanovich .
oh , th th that's great .
th th that's just great .
you know , l i love peter . peter's a beautiful guy .
god bless him .
i , uh ...
val !
val , the client wants more overhead coverage of the spray cans .
one minute .
lori , this is humiliating .
l i'm up here shooting a deodorant commercial .
i got two oscars .
up here , you don't need oscars .
you need antlers .
here's a funny script about two kids in a college fraternity ... who invent a machine that can turn women back into virgins again .
it's very clever .
what's the matter?
you know , when you asked me to come out here for you , you promised me ... that i wasn't just going to be one of those bright women who who finds properties ... and goes to lunch 500 times developing them , and then never gets one made .
honey , the city that never sleeps is green lit .
that's been your project from day one .
yeah , sure .
until i suggest the director .
and then even though you admit he'd be perfect for it ...
i get shot down .
you didn't get shot down , honey .
i know that that's a risky choice , but it's an inspired choice .
i think you're trying to help him because you feel guilty .
guilty?
why should i feel guilty?
because i fell in love with you?
i mean , god knows i put enough years in that marriage .
that's right .
you did absolutely nothing wrong .
i know .
i brought up his name because ... [ sighs ] because he would give you the best movie for that script .
nobody argued that .
he's probably so angry he won't even speak to you .
and he's liable to ruin the picture just to get even with me .
no .
you're wrong about that .
i'm telling you , you're wrong .
he would be grateful .
he needs a comeback , and ...
ellie , this is a very , very expensive film .
it's got solid box office potential .
he can do it .
you don't regret leaving him , do you?
you know , one day you look up and you realize that laughs are not enough .
i can handle him , hal .
i just got tired of having to all the time .
and then , you know ... then i met you .
what are you doing home?
i quit .
no !
val , not again .
you quit over nothing again?
not over nothing .
what?
i quit over a big thing .
what?
they fired me .
that was big enough to quit over .
oh , val !
that's just great .
i got the last plane out of toronto .
have you ever seen canada?
now i know why there's no crime up there .
boy , i must say ... you don't seem too enthused over seeing me .
well , can you blame me?
what are you gonna do now?
you're gonna sit around the apartment , talking about the good old days .
i gotta get a picture .
boy , somebody's got to take a chance on me .
this is ridiculous .
when you're cold , you're cold .
fortunately , my business manager put away enough money before he went to prison ...
so i could hold out another three weeks , maybe .
your agent called .
hey , you know , if you'd come up there with me , it might have been different .
two people in that sleeping bag is a lot cozier than one .
and who goes on for me in the play?
for god sakes , it's an off off broadway play .
you're in the last stages .
your understudy could have gone on for you .
are you kidding?
my understudy?
right , and that will be the one night ... that steven spielberg comes to see the play , or harvey weinstein .
they're not coming , believe me .
they're fasting .
i would've been so good in that shakespeare movie .
what's ...
oh !
what's that?
these are pelts .
l i traded with a fur trapper between shots ... so the trip wouldn't be a total loss .
your agent sent over that script .
a script?
why didn't you tell me about this?
the city that never sleeps .
when did this come in?
well?
what did you think of it?
you know , i thought it had definite potential .
it's got a , you know , really good manhattan feel to it .
you know , they're interested in you directing .
you know , that's fine with me .
you know , this is the kind of material that i can really do great .
this is ...
this is ...
you know , i can make this script sing .
this is new york .
it's nightclubs .
it's the skyline .
you want some water?
i'm very excited .
please .
me too .
who wants me?
well , uh , we have a little selling to do ... but , uh , galaxie is making it .
hal yeager?
yes , that's right .
he stole my wife .
ellie is the one who's pushing for you .
pass .
i'm not gonna work with hal yeager and ellie .
you gotta be kidding .
he's a philistine and she's a quisling .
it's a religious conflict .
will you calm down .
it's everything you've been looking for .
i ...
you know , i'm frankly flabbergasted they would even think of me .
well , they didn't think of you .
she did .
and she has convinced yeager to come fly to new york and take a meeting with you .
this guy stole my wife .
he doesn't hold that against you .
it's business .
can you believe that she would leave me for for hal yeager?
i still can't get my mind around it .
mr. slick ...
the price of his haircut could feed a family of five .
calm down .
you're getting all red .
would you calm down .
and you're telling me she ... he doesn't want me?
she's the ...
the nerve of them .
he's such a manicured phony .
may he ...
may he fall on his blow comb ... and get hot in the wrong place .
please , val .
please don't do anything to kill this .
it's a golden opportunity .
forget it .
i would rather do the geriatric diaper commercial i turned down .
would you?
because that's what the future holds if this falls through .
of course i wouldn't .
this is a terrific script .
i , you know ...
i ...
make some sense now .
a $60 million dollar , first class feature film .
a big payday , which you need .
and if you score with this one , you're back on top .
you'll never have a gift like this drop in your lap again .
just take the meeting with yeager .
and ellie?
yes , and ellie .
i'm telling you , i'll get you half a million dollars .
a lousy half mil they're offering?
they want to buy prestige at the shrine auditorium oscar night for a half mil?
there's no offer .
it's not an offer yet .
i reject their offer .
there is nothing to reject .
well , i reject it anyhow .
you better meet with him and you better be nice , or else i'm out of here .
i finally get an offer that's worthy of my gifts , and look where it comes from .
there is no offer yet .
and i am so tired of all this ...
the big talk about how big you were ten years ago .
things change , and you can't get work .
you know , part of me wants it so badly .
and the other part?
also wants it .
that's the problem .
it only takes one hit .
i know .
and i want a role in this movie .
i don't have the movie yet .
he's gotta meet me and throw his weight around first .
and not just a little bit .
something where i can show off what i can do .
lori , i can't stick my girlfriend in the movie .
i'm not just your girlfriend .
i'm good .
remember all those times i told you you should take acting lessons?
i'm a natural .
classes would ruin me .
jesus .
you know , ellie feels guilty about dumping me ... so this is her way of clearing her conscience .
great !
what's the difference how it came about?
this whole thing is creepy , lori .
for god sakes , this is a woman i was married to for 10 years .
we made love .
i'd hold her head over the toilet bowl when she threw up .
from making love with you?
not from making love with me .
from eating sushi .
for god's sakes , i used to hug her when she was afraid of flying .
and and , you know , i kissed her on top of the eiffel tower .
i swam in the moonlight with her at montauk .
now suddenly i got to take a meeting with her?
i don't know .
i've got very mixed feelings .
this guy has really got to show me he's changed .
he's not in a position to make extraordinary demands .
because it was over for him years ago .
he hasn't touched anything for years ... garbage .
i'm telling you , garbage .
i mean , i'm not saying that as criticism , you know .
the question is , do i wanna let this has been make his comeback picture on my money?
he's not a has been .
he's a very good director ...
who's fallen on some difficulty times .
he brought it on himself .
he's his own worst enemy .
look , think of the press angle , you know .
val waxman does his comeback film for galaxie pictures .
what good is the press if the guy ruins the picture?
he's not gonna ruin the picture .
no , you're damn right he's not because i'll fire him .
i'm not going to take temperamental antics from some " owteur " genius .
auteur . auteur .
whatever .
okay , auteur .
you're doing a jack story , okay?
he can do this film better than anybody i can think of .
ha !
we'll see .
you're so nervous .
you're making me nervous .
i'm not nervous .
i'm tense .
you are nervous .
i'm tense .
when i'm nervous , i bite my nails .
when i'm tense , i do this with my collar .
just act ...
calm down and act professional .
i am .
i'm fine .
but this is a guy who stole my wife .
years ago , i would never have consented to make a film for him ... and now ... now suddenly i'm auditioning for him?
it's crazy .
you know , i would kill for this job ... but the people i want to kill are the people who are offering me the job .
it's just insanity .
what is that?
remember in the cab i took a blue pill?
yeah?
well , that was to calm my anger .
but it had speed in it .
so then i took another pill after that to calm down the speed .
well , this gets me back up to speed , where i want to be actually for the meeting .
great .
perfect .
yeah .
then that other pill i took keeps me dry when it's raining out .
ellie .
ellie .
hello , al .
so good to see you .
hello , val .
hello , val .
al .
how are you?
good to see you .
ed .
i'm so glad you could get here .
are they still having power failures?
i read that there was a terrible power failure in california .
can i get you some coffee?
coffee would be wonderful .
electricity .
that the electricity was going off .
come on in .
since when do you wear suits?
you have any milk?
you never wore suits .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
uh , cream .
well , val , you look very good .
i'm okay , you know .
i've been having some back spasms ... and i have a torn rotator cuff , and and , my knee ...
you know , i got a hearing loss .
it's the oddest thing .
in my left ear ...
what did you think of the script?
the script?
you know , the movie that it's based on was a stupid little potboiler .
he's asking about the script .
but the rewrite is good .
thanks to ellie .
she did all the work .
yeah , it's good .
you know , i think this could make ... a kind of tough , gritty , new york , big city movie .
you can't make any money just in big cities .
well , i mean , where do you think this is going to play?
it's not going to appeal to farmers or shopping malls in biloxi .
oh , i completely disagree .
i think if this picture is mounted properly ... it's gonna have universal appeal .
where do you think the demographics are?
the the demographics?
you mean why the country got so stupid suddenly?
my theory's fast foods .
the age group .
the age group of this film .
where do you see it?
the age?
this will appeal to , you know ... to , uh ...
adults and teenagers , young adults ... and, you know , kids , adolescents , i think .
toddlers , i imagine .
newborns .
our marketing research shows this film has wide appeal for both sexes .
yes , i agree and then some , actually .
but , the script has some holes in it .
val ...
like what?
well , take the climax , for instance .
i think the climax comes ... comes too early is the problem .
it should come after the trial scene .
didn't i say that?
the inciting event should come later .
the character of benny .
i feel we should shoot benny ... with a hand held camera and not a steadicam .
but it should be nervous .
it should , you know ...
put the audience ill at ease , like his inner personality .
i don't know if i like that .
it could be with a steadicam .
you even said that .
let me ask you how you'd feel about this , and be honest .
what if we shot the whole picture in black and white?
why?
because new york city is a black and white town .
it reeks of black and white .
forget it .
arty .
it's arty .
does anybody have an aspirin?
do you have an aspirin?
here , try one of these .
my herbalist gave them to me .
i can do this picture .
i know ...
i got a feel for it .
i see it all , maybe with like a cole porter score?
all right .
let us discuss it .
we're talking to a couple of other directors and , um , we'll let you know .
maybe irving berlin or something .
you bridge the ...
well , i think we'd have to discuss it .
you know , if there ever was a val waxman property , boy , this is it , right?
we'll keep in touch .
does anyone have a xanax?
zantac .
i've got an ulcer too .
notzantac , xanax .
it's a completely different problem .
can i talk to you?
listen , val ...
oh , sorry .
it was great seeing you again .
it was .
you've got an herbalist?
oh , yes .
a genius .
in beverly hills he's a genius .
if he was in new york , he'd be considered low normal .
you know , we use a completely different rating system here .
when we were kids , there were like ten foreign films a week in this city .
italian , french ...
oh , italian films .
i love them .
val waxman .
any messages?
you're sure?
okay .
did you see my cat?
isn't that neat?
sorry about that .
uh , no .
nothing .
anything?
we were just talking aboutalfred hitchcock .
mm hmm .
truffaut said notorious was his best film .
i agree .
a masterpiece .
what are you talking about?
you hate ...
he hates that movie .
the ending makes you crazy .
yes , because it's a masterpiece .
every time i watch that movie ... when cary grant is carrying ingrid bergman down the staircase ...
i always think that the germans are going to catch them .
i do too .
no matter how many times i see it , i think the germans are gonna get them .
hitchcock was an artist , but he was commercial .
yeah , that's right .
you say that like it's a good thing .
you have to be both .
i mean , he knew what he was doing .
in order to make movies ... you have to think about the audience , you have to ...
otherwise , you're just making movies for yourself , like artistic masturbation .
that's right .
that's right .
you're a narcissist .
i'm a classic narcissist then .
have i told you my views on masturbation ever?
for me , the nicest thing about masturbation is afterward , the cuddling time .
they're laughing .
i'm not joking .
want a wienie?
you got it .
you're directing the city that never sleeps .
i just got the call .
i can't believe it .
i ...
i can't speak .
i got you half a million , plus a tenth of a point after quadruple break even .
listen , uh , they're going back to l. a. tonight .
you think you could meet ellie for a drink for ten minutes?
why?
why?
because you owe her some thanks , that's why .
she went out on a limb for you .
i think she wants to make sure you're both on the same page .
think about hal yeager .
he's quick to hire , quick to fire .
you need ellie to run interference .
all right .
all right .
i'll meet her at the the ...
bemelmans bar at 9 : 00 .
i can spare ten minutes .
l i can't tell ya , my head's swimming .
a tenth of a point after quadruple break even .
you are really a shark , al .
#### [ piano ]
congratulations .
thank you .
can i get a beck's , please?
since we're working together , i thought we should sit down and talk for a few minutes .
that's fine with me .
i mean , as you know , hal was a little skeptical at first ... but in the end , you know , he's a businessman and very professional .
let me set your mind at ease .
you don't have to worry about everything .
things are gonna go very smoothly .
this is ...
this is a big shot for me and i realize that ... you know , many people think that i'm ... that i can be difficult .
but you know i can be very professional ... and obviously , hal yeager's very professional ... and you're professional , clearly .
so , you know , as long as business is business , there should be no ...
i cannot understand how you could leave me for that cheesy windbag .
it's mind numbing to me .
i just don't understand that .
and you carry on with him behind my back for two months .
it was not two months .
yes .
yes , it was .
don't tell me it wasn't .
you were carrying on behind my back ...
not even behind my back , but under my nose .
that's twice a day .
both places .
okay , you're exaggerating .
i'm not exaggerating .
you were always on the phone with him .
you were exchanging glances .
i noticed it .
then suddenly , you were exchanging fluids .
l i can't believe that i didn't really see it .
you were too self absorbed .
you were too intent on becoming the greatamerican film artist .
don't tell me that .
everything was fine with you until i started to lose my audience .
then suddenly you dump me and move out to beverly hills with the swimming pool .
you hated california .
we both hated it .
you hated traveling every place by car all the time .
and i hated traveling by mud slide .
well , what did you want me to do?
our marriage wasn't going anyplace .
where did you want it to go?
where do marriages go?
after awhile they all lay there .
that's the thing about marriages .
look ...
you know , that's ridiculous .
no , it was in trouble for a long time .
you see , you don't see what you don't want to see .
how was it in trouble?
we didn't ...
we didn't communicate .
we had sex .
yes , we had sex .
but we never talked .
sex is better than talk .
ask anybody in this bar .
you can't ...
talk is what you suffer through so you can get to sex .
you isolate everything .
you can't just compartmentalize like that .
a good marriage consists of many parts well integrated .
yes , and is one of those parts adultery?
never .
absolutely .
at the plaza hotel .
for god sakes , i got the bill .
you had the escargot that afternoon .
i can't ...
it's so disgusting .
sex and snails with that roast beef from beverly hills .
you were so busy playing the american artist .
that's what you were doing , playing .
you felt it was important to be uncompromising and temperamental ... and difficult ...
god , difficult !
to starve and to suffer .
i tell you , you had all the symptoms , not the disease .
you used to think i was creative and original .
and i still do ... as a filmmaker .
it's when you became creative as a hypochondriac , that was it .
hey , all those attacks were for real .
oh , yeah?
yes .
the black plague , val?
an allergy to oxygen?
elm blight?
only trees get elm blight ...
elm trees .
can i sum it up?
you cheated on me .
you lied .
you dumped me ...
business .
we're here to discuss business .
that's right .
can we discuss it?
i wanna keep this absolutely on a professional level .
absolutely .
i think that we should rework the script a little bit ... because i think it doesn't have to be middle aged people .
we could make the character of kelly swain , you know , maybe coming out of college .
that's true .
you mean out of law school?
law school , yeah .
i think they'd like that at galaxie .
that way we could cast somebody like terry tyler ...
great . or maybe find ... there's a lot of talented kids out there .
you are such a shallow jerk !
i can't get my mind around it .
that you would leave me for a guy who is the opposite of everything i am .
you know , with his ski lodge in aspen and his collection of vintage cars .
if i drove around in a 1939 mercedes , people would think i was himmler .
hal's very smart , and he's a brilliant deal maker .
yes , i know .
he's been audited by the best .
he has made some pretty financially successful american films .
that should tell you all you need to know about him .
he's the white line down the middle of the road .
you had your little flirtations too .
there was that that italian model .
no .
you were the only one that i was serious with .
my god .
until you suddenly became noncommunicative , nonresponsive and you dumped me ...
the movie is going to be a fun movie to do , i think .
um , and i have a lot of ideas that i think we should discuss .
good .
absolutely .
i just wanted to assure you that once the studio agreed to you ... you'll have their full support and ...
well , thank you very much .
i want a ...
i think i want a foreign cameraman .
that's no problem .
because they get a texture into the work ... that you would never get with an american cameraman .
they have a certain mobility .
i remember coming home and i picked up the extension ... and there you are on the other end of the extension with this guy .
i'm calling and i hear my wife in a lovey dovey with her lover , saying she misses her lover .
he wasn't my lover yet .
bull !
he was your lover .
what are you telling me?
and i recognize the voice .
it's hal yeager from galaxie pictures .
and i'm thinking to myself , " why is my wife talking like that to hal yeager for?
they're making me a surprise party .
i thought they were making me a surprise party .
were they?
no .
she was having an affair with hal yeager .
follow the story .
jesus , i can't believe this ...
i'm getting out of here .
wait a minute .
where are you going?
we're discussing a movie .
no , i'm sorry .
i just ...
what about ...
i'll be back and forth from l. a. and i won't bother you ... and i'll see to it that nobody gets in your way creatively .
what about denise daniels as the blackmailer?
possibly .
if you like .
i think she would be great .
you know what i mean?
or sarah bedloe .
she would be very interesting .
she ...
i pick up the phone and she's talking ...
i'm going to order a corn beef sandwich , she's talking to her lover on the phone .
look , i'll be back from l. a. in two weeks ...
this is gonna be a fun picture .
it'll be great .
we're all very excited .
i'm looking forward to it .
about hal yeager .
the word on him is cross dresser .
check it out for me .
i pick the phone up and she ...
hal , we're off to a really good start here .
tell me about it , honey .
val wants to use a foreign cameraman , which i think we should give him .
he's got a real visual concept of where he wants to go with this thing .
um , now he's chosen kow chan , a chinese cameraman ... done some stunning work , mostly with the red army .
he says he doesn't like his hotel .
he much prefer the sherry .
hal , listen .
val wants to go with elio sebastian as art director .
val says that elio really knows the streets of new york .
every location in the script is out there waiting to be found .
this is great .
it saves us a fortune .
times square and harlem .
i have to build times square and harlem .
we can't build times square and harlem .
with all due respect .
he wants to build the empire state building?
no .
just the first 20 stories .
absolutely not .
no , sweetheart .
it's not gonna happen , okay?
just tell him no .
it's not gonna happen .
all right , i'll handle it .
good .
great .
hey , listen .
i miss you .
how's the weather back there?
it's been great , you know?
it's been really new york moody .
very gray and cloudy .
that's the way it is .
today's the first day of sun we've had in awhile .
well , listen , here it's been fabulous .
sunny and clear every day .
oh , listen .
i gotta run .
i'm having another skin cancer removed .
this is perfect .
this view is absolutely perfect .
no , no .
i hate it .
i'm ... we're just gonna have to build it .
build central park?
yeah .
you know , i take back what i said before about ...
mixing real locations and sets ...
i don't wanna be a money watchdog here ... but if you did build everything ...
i say this metaphorically ... it'd have to be done over my dead body ... metaphorically .
all right , if not the whole park , then just the reservoir .
build the reservoir?
uh huh .
you know what?
you get a studio ...
put a tank in it and fill it with a couple thousand gallons of water ...
it'll work .
and then ...
wait ... trees behind it , you know?
new york as a symphony in green .
green i hate .
i never use green .
no .
no green .
you know what?
tell mother nature , okay?
trees are green .
we can play it for the winter .
you can use snow .
i buy that .
a white background to set off the two leads ... and marvelous '40s red .
what?
what?
what is he saying?
what?
he says no white .
no white .
he cannot shoot white background .
sebastian , what have you gotten me into here?
you know what?
i prefer green myself .
green and red .
all i'm saying is that i think you're being precipitous in firing him .
look , i never wanted this guy .
not from day one .
hal ...
i beg your entire pardon .
may i just offer for your consideration ...
a single concept , and i say this ...
you don't have to ...
stand up , you don't have to lean into the speaker .
look , he's out .
i want this guy out before this picture becomes a cost nightmare .
look , hal , i think that maybe if we had a talk with him .
i said from the start to use harold pappas .
pappas is a hack .
pappas is safe , but he's uninspired .
i can't work with him .
then you should bow out now .
i said i can't work with him .
i didn't say i wouldn't .
val , i don't mean to get hot under the collar , but pappas has how many nominations ... compared to this greenwich village lunatic?
they probably spent more money getting those nominations ...
than he'll spend building a reservoir .
i didn't get that .
nothing .
nothing , hal .
i gave in on the chinese cameraman .
i've kept away from your picture .
i'm saying i'd feel more secure with pappas .
a word to the wise .
is there anything about the part of benny ... that you want to tell me before i read it?
only that he's a broadway sharpie , a gambler .
like sky masterson?
perfect .
exactly .
now , forgive me , it might seem obvious , but he's a runyonesque ... bookmaker type , uh , is tough , but softhearted with his wife who he's nuts about?
that's it on the nose .
that would be perfect .
go .
jerry , some guys were over the house looking for you .
seems you owe some money .
i hope you didn't tell them anything , helen .
i could find myself in deep trouble .
deep , deep trouble .
thank you .
hi .
i'll wait for you .
if they give you 30 years , i'll be waiting .
if they give you 50 years , i'll be waiting .
if you get two consecutive life sentences ...
i'll be waiting .
i thought that last girl was kind of interesting .
did you?
really?
i thought she read it better than the others .
i know , but claire's supposed to be classy .
didn't you think she was a little on the cheap side?
cheap?
to be perfectly honest , i thought she radiated stupidity .
stupidity?
i mean , her reading was competent enough ... but , my god , it's like her persona ... it's trashy and dumb .
well , you know , i think i'd like to use her .
she was interesting .
you're the director .
it's not that big a part , ellie .
but it's a featured role .
claire's supposed to be a socialite , for god sakes .
this girl , " lori fox , " she's like a step above trailer park .
well , i would hardly call her trailer park .
i said a step above .
well , i'd like to use her .
i thought she was perfect for the role .
fine .
i mean , it's your decision .
i'm just throwing out ideas .
you can take 'em or leave 'em .
two for yeager , please .
they're clearing your table , mr. yeager .
thank you .
i am so glad that you could come in .
i really am .
i was here on business and i wanted an excuse to see you .
i didn't want you to think i was crowding you .
i know you , you know .
you're checking up on me .
everything's going really fine .
it is .
and val?
val's val .
he seems reasonably flexible .
most of his ideas are really good .
you'll see .
i hope so .
right this way .
thank you .
there are no personal feelings that make it seem awkward?
no , no .
i think he's accepted things and moved on .
good .
by the way ...
andrea ford's going to be covering the making of the film for esquire .
oh , no kid ...
hey , val .
we were just talking about you .
hey , val .
ellie was telling me how well things are going .
how are you?
good to see you .
everything all right?
what are you doing here?
what do you mean , " what am i doing ...
no , what are you doing here at this moment?
we used to eat here .
hal came in on a plane a few hours ago .
that's the best way to fly .
what are you doing in this restaurant at this moment?
what do you mean?
we're coming in to get a bite ...
are you all right?
you're awfully fidgety or something .
what are you doing?
are you okay?
yes , no , i'm fine .
i was just thinking you should go to your table because it's crowded here .
i'm ready to go .
it's the woman that was at the audition today .
that's very funny .
hello , miss .
aren't you going to introduce me?
it's lori fox , isn't it?
yes , of course .
i think it was .
yes .
val is such a riot .
stop kidding around .
i just ...
i really wanted to put your mind at ease ... that just because i'm the director's significant other , i can still act .
hi .
hal?
hey , mort .
how are you?
i thought you were in aspen .
i wish .
you know ellie , my fiance?
hi .
how are you?
hi .
i'm lori fox .
nice to meet you .
f f fiance?
congratulations .
when's the date?
new year's eve .
my goodness , how romantic .
that's wonderful .
congratulations on your new film .
you know val waxman .
of course .
sure .
we sued him ...
fiance? for failure to complete a picture .
that makes me feel secure .
i'll see you tomorrow , val .
hurry !
i'll miss my flight .
this is not a good time for you to go away .
i'm very vulnerable .
if i'm gonna be in this movie , i have to get into shape .
this spa is the only way i'll ever have the discipline .
but you're not overweight .
oh , my god !
i'm a horse .
i have to appear in lingerie .
what if we need you?
it's a ten week shooting schedule .
my scene doesn't come until the very end .
what if i need you?
i'm going through a bad time .
you'll be fine .
you'll be fine .
you're a big boy .
oh , geez .
you know , i'm afraid to sleep alone .
l l i keep thinking people are breaking in .
i lay awake all night ... thinking of death and the blackness and the abyss .
oh , oh , don't forget to water my cactus .
call me every day .
i can't .
they don't have any phones at dolby ranch .
they want to discourage secret eating schemes .
oh !
oh !
oh , my gosh .
oh , my gosh .
okay , i gotta go .
gotta go !
and we want to see the earrings .
profile .
other profile , please .
and cut .
thank you .
is it true your cameraman speaks only chinese?
yes , mandarin .
it's so hard to find a good cantonese cameraman these days .
neighborhoods just don't have them anymore .
hal yeager's known to be very hands on , very hot tempered ... quick to replace people .
does that bother you?
no , because the deal is ... they're going to leave me alone during the shooting .
i have complete freedom .
how about working so closely with your ex wife?
well , it's not so close .
she'lljust be up and back .
it's not going to be that close .
well , there must be some bitterness .
especially now that she's going to marry hal yeager , the man she left you for ... who's now your boss?
who are you?
oh , i'm andrea ford .
i'm going to be doing the story ... on the making of the movie for esquire .
oh , really .
are you?
yeah .
yeah .
didn't they tell you?
i'm going to be observing the whole time .
'cause i don't usually like , you know , when journalists hang around the set ...
and observe when i work .
take that up with the press department .
but don't worry .
i won't get in your way .
i promise .
i am a huge fan .
yes?
oh , huge .
i have loved all of your movies .
oh , well , you know ...
and you'll be hanging around doing a story here?
yes .
because , in fact , i've always thought of you as a unique american artist .
oh .
well , i'm sure you won't be in the way here .
you know , there's plenty of room and you can have ...
val .
hey , gosh , i'm so sorry .
can i steal him for a minute?
i really was about to ...
some things we have to go over .
i'll get him right back to you .
i'm so sorry .
in one minute .
i'm so sorry .
you need to be careful .
she is a killer .
she's a killer?
i didn't think it was a good idea having her around all the time .
but then the press department told hal that they could get the cover of esquire and so ...
how is she a killer?
she loves me .
well , that's fine .
i mean , if she likes you , you know .
otherwise , she can be biting .
really?
i hear she's all sugar and sweetness ... and gets into your good graces and then wham !
she kept telling sean madigan how she loved all of his films and she was a big fan .
how he was a great , i don't know , unique american artist .
really?
and then in the profile , she disemboweled him .
you know , if you happen to fall for that kind of flattery ...
i can handle it , though .
please .
you couldn't handle shirley temple .
give me a break , will ya?
you know , i can't figure it out .
it's okay to have an affair with hal yeager , but ... you know , everyone is entitled to have one psychotic episode in their lives , but ...
to marry the guy is ...
honestly , i wouldn't talk if i were you .
what does that mean?
i don't know .
how long have you been living with that wind up doll i met?
you know i don't like to sleep alone .
for god's sakes , i'm not going to marry her .
and that wind up doll happens to have a ph . d.
in what?
history of gym?
hey , look .
will you give me a break with the cutting remarks?
i got a picture to do tuesday .
i'm thinking about my work .
i want you to get some rest this weekend , okay?
and don't lie around the whole time worrying about everything that could go wrong .
don't worry .
i'm not going to lie around .
i've got my hand on the wheel , honey .
this picture's in the bank .
amanda , honey , who is it?
i don't know .
uncle al , it's for you .
please , i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
a man or woman?
hello?
al , you gotta get over here right away .
why?
what's wrong?
i'm at my sister's for a seder .
al , you gotta get over here .
this is a matter of life and death !
it's open .
come in !
what is it?
what's going on?
what am i doing here?
al , i going to try to explain this to you .
i came home , and i started to make notes on the script , you know ... because we shoot tuesday and i wanted , you know ... then i started to get nervous .
so , i sat down on the sofa , and i was doing my deep breathing exercises ... just to stay calm , you know?
and it was working , and i started to relax , and i dozed off .
then i slept for a while .
then i woke up , al ... and ...
i can't see anything .
what?
i'm blind .
i'm blind , al .
what?
i'm blind .
i'm blind .
i can't see .
what do you mean , you can't see?
what do i mean?
those guys in the street with the dark glasses and accordions?
what are you talking about?
are you trying?
al , you can't try and see .
you look around and you see or you don't see .
i don't see .
how can you be blind?
howthe hell do i know how i can be blind?
i'm ...
al , i'm scared .
what did you eat?
what's the difference what i ate?
you you you can't lose your vision from a plate of tofu .
l i never heard of anything like this .
yes .
i did .
remember the actor harvey gates?
yeah?
he lost his vision suddenly .
from what?
grapefruit .
grapefruit?
yes , he had a tumor the size of a grapefruit on his brain .
and he went blind?
yes , he went blind ... and and a few months later he went dead ... which is worse than blind 'cause your options decrease .
relax .
you don't have a brain tumor .
al , with all due respect ...
i have to hear that from somebody who went to a greater medical school ... than the william morris agency .
we'll get you to dr. mason .
you still use mason , right?
no .
mason dropped dead on the treadmill .
i use koch .
you know , i use koch too .
did you bump into anything?
did you fall?
did you bump your head or something?
i didn't bump my head .
nothing !
al , i got a brain tumor .
that's the story here .
l i ...
the end is in sight .
i see the wall .
i thought you said you couldn't see .
it's an expression .
i don't actually mean i see a wall .
it's in my mind's eye .
listen .
i remember that ellie and i took you to the hospital ...
you insisted on taking you to the hospital because you were convinced ...
you had hoof and mouth disease .
oh , god .
ellie !
look , if i die , al , tell ellie i'm sorry i said all those things to her .
i said terrible things to her .
i called her all kinds of names .
probably because i never stopped loving her .
you're not dying .
well , if i don't die , tell her she's a tramp and she's living with a guy ... the best you could say about him is sometimes he returns phone calls .
oh , dr. koch .
it's al hack here .
i'm sorry to call you at home on holiday , but i'm sitting here with val waxman ...
okay , you can sit back now .
so so , what is the story?
well , your optic nerve is normal .
your eye exam is normal .
i don't see anything .
wonderful .
you don't see anything?
i don't see anything either .
that's the problem .
any tumor large enough to impact on his vision so dramatically would show up .
i only wish i was in as good health as he is .
this is a textbook scenario . physically , you're 100 percent .
but just like someone who has an hysterical paralysis ... a patient who's fine but he can't walk ... or a patient who loses his or her voice ... from witnessing a horrible shock or any extreme , stress related trauma ...
being a film director , your inner conflicts ... have chosen to express themselves in this very telling fashion .
you're psychosomatically blind .
how can i get rid of it?
by treatment .
by understanding the roots of your conflict ...
there's every chance that this blindness will go away .
how quickly?
well , real growth is always very slow .
there goes my comeback .
you cannot breathe a word of this to anybody .
i gotta tell 'em , al .
you know , i just dread telling ellie .
are you nuts?
they'll fire you .
fire me?
i obviously can't direct the picture .
what are you talking about?
how can you blow this shot?
what are you talking about?
i'm blind .
nobody knows .
what the hell does that mean?
what are you suggesting?
if you pull out of this project now because psychological stress ... has caused you to lose your sight , you'll never work again .
they'll burn your union card .
maybe they could postpone it .
oh , yeah , because you're blind?
val , direct this picture and bring in a hit ... or i leave you with two words : homeless man .
i can't direct ...
how can i ...
i'm telling you how .
you're going to muddle your way through until your sight returns .
al , i can't direct a picture .
i'm blind .
have you seen some of the pictures out there?
the first five minutes they'll catch me .
maybe they will , maybe they won't .
if they do , you're no worse off than if you confess ... because you're finished in the business anyway .
you gotta be joking .
i'll take one step on the set , i'll break my neck .
no , no , no .
i'll come with you .
they won't let you .
the actors get nervous when agents hang around .
it's against galaxie policy .
listen .
once you get on the set , you get relaxed , you won't even need me .
there's no way to do this .
i would have to take somebody into my confidence .
absolutely not .
no .
never .
not a hint .
this can't get out .
you will direct a hit picture .
sometimes god works in strange ways .
like job .
notes on " making of the city that never sleeps .
first morning atmosphere is upbeat .
lots of eager anticipation .
people moving lights .
actors and actresses all ready in costume and makeup .
val waxman is not the first one on the set .
actually , a few minutes late .
this is never going to work .
it's working perfect .
just stand straight .
am i going to bump into anything?
no , no , no .
i'll guide you .
you don't trust me .
you have to trust me .
i gotta look funny .
you look perfect .
i'm telling you .
l l i ...
look at this .
how wonderful .
nice .
good morning .
would you like anything?
any coffee?
coffee .
want some coffee?
coffee .
yeah .
no .
no .
no .
i'm ...
no thank you .
okay .
well , the actors are here if you're ready to block the scene .
blo blo block the scene?
yes .
we could ...
listen , val .
are you okay with the changes in the set?
oh , the set .
it's beautiful .
oh .
it's great .
how do you feel about the background color?
you satisfied?
it's blue and , you know , brown and yellow , but is it a little dark?
beg your pardon , who are you?
i'm al hack .
al , can i speak to you a second?
yeah , uh , i'll be right back .
don't worry .
i'll be right back .
al?
yes , yes , yes?
not that you're not welcome here .
you know i love you .
yes , yes .
but , you know , this is a closed set .
oh , well , you see , he really needs me .
he likes me to be with him .
i know , but a man of your stature ... an agent ...
you know , it intimidates people .
oh ...
you look so good .
have you had any work done?
just over here .
a little?
'cause i ...
who did you go to?
not that i need it ...
fred .
fred . but i'm thinking about it .
oh , he's incredible .
you got the best clients .
can you get me a price?
i think that we may be like a little bit too light .
would you prefer that i take the whole thing one shade darker?
eh , well , that's a ... that's a possibility .
what do you think?
what would you do?
well , i really don't know .
it's possible i could make the whole thing match the upholstery .
that's another option .
that's brilliant .
that's what i would do .
i would match the upholstery .
excuse me .
chief , what alarm clock would you like to go with?
uh , that one .
that one .
that one .
which one?
i'm sorry ...
i'm sorry .
which  yes .
yes .
yes .
you like the wind up or the electric?
yes .
the wind up .
wind up .
i like the wind up .
val?
val?
excuse me .
excuse me , gentlemen .
can i see you just for a second?
don't worry .
excuse me .
al , this is not working .
don't worry .
don't worry .
it's going to work fine .
but you're right .
it is a closed set , and i have to leave .
you ...
listen to me .
listen to me .
just go to plan " b.
what is plan " b "?
we don't have a plan " b.
we gotta find somebody ... who you trust who will help you .
someone you can rely on .
you mean , tell someone the truth?
yes .
somebody you can rely on .
we'll get somebody who's around you all the time .
who doesn't look odd , you know?
maybe the a. d.?
what about the script girl?
i can't do that .
they'll get in trouble .
if they get caught ... they'll never work in the business again .
l i have a responsibility , al , to ellie and even to hal .
you have a responsibility to yourself !
you have agent's ethics .
i can't go by you .
don't hit me with oxymorons at this time .
we're in a crisis !
wait a minute .
shh .
what about the chinese kid?
the translator?
yes , the translator .
the translator .
he's a business student at nyu , right?
he doesn't care if he's in the movie business .
if he gets caught , it's no big penalty .
well , he is always around me .
it's a natural natural ...
yes , see?
val , i've got the actors .
we are ready for you .
don't worry .
don't worry .
i'll get you to the set .
take it easy .
take it easy .
i'll take you .
i'll take you .
it's gonna be fine .
if lf i'm acting so crazy , everyone'll notice that i'm acting crazy .
listen .
you got a reputation for being crazy .
this is the perfect time for it to work in your favor .
watch out .
one step .
one step .
ah , very good .
hey , can i have mr. waxman's chair here?
the director needs his chair .
where is it?
chair?
thank you very much .
here , come sit .
look , your lucky chair .
oh .
isn't that wonderful?
sit , sit , sit .
be relaxed .
real good .
good luck .
i can't work with outside people watching me .
nobody's gonna be watching .
incidentally , you like this one or this one?
i like that one .
this one?
'cause this one's more like ...
yes , that one . what they'd really use , but this one's more theatrical .
well , you know , you can use this one if you'd like .
but i prefer that one .
which one?
the first or the second?
this one .
i'd like to make my entrance from the stairs .
hold it .
what ...
who ordered?
who ordered?
what's happening?
how do you want me to kiss her?
what's happening here?
which way did you want me to kiss her?
you know , on the ... on the mouth .
what about my mouth?
no , kiss her on the mouth .
he hasn't seen here for six years .
we originally discussed some kind of passionate way of grabbing her .
oh , well , use both lips .
oh , excuse me .
could i talk to you just for a second?
me?
yeah , just for a minute .
uh , they need me .
well , actually , the director ...
the director asked me to talk to you .
yes .
mr. waxman?
it's a chance to make some extra salary .
now , you seem to be a very responsible young man .
are you?
you should move left .
you got me doing two things at once here .
i can't work if i don't know what you want .
you should cross left .
wait .
me?
you mean my left?
if i cross my left , i'm going to bump right into him .
you don't have to bump me .
i'm probably going to knock him over .
where is the translator?
excuse me .
he's supposed to be on set .
sir , i have a very important message for you .
important message for me?
um , i'm here to help you .
i know about your secret .
don't !
cut !
very good .
that was terrific .
was it very good?
was it very good?
well , i don't see the dramatic impact of it .
but it did seem a little improvement from the random chaos ...
you were encouraging .
oh , thank you .
you didn't like the random chaos , huh?
let's ...
can we go again?
just for safety , one more?
okay , sir , we're approaching a hallway right now .
so we're gonna walk slowly .
there's nobody here .
practically nobody .
okay .
be careful .
i'm trying to be casual , but it's extremely difficult .
oh , i know that ...
ooh !
sorry .
boss , you all right?
yes .
no , i'm fine .
it was my fault completely .
i forgive you .
sir , he's gone .
he's not there anymore .
you're talking to air .
why didn't you warn me?
i thought you saw him .
this is very weird for me .
you thought i saw him?
how am i ...
a few summers ago i did aid a deaf uncle .
you're going too fast .
okay , slowly , slowly .
it's very weird .
i was helping out a deaf uncle a few summers ago ... but we didn't have to hide it like this .
oh, jesus , this is great .
val , you wanna go with this one tomorrow or the big one?
uh , well ...
wow .
these are beautiful pocket watches .
thanks .
i would go with the big one .
val , um , how'd you feel the first day went?
the first day was , you know , like the first day .
it was like a shakedown where you weed out the malcontents .
oh , good .
i'd love to speak to you for a few minutes if you're not too busy and all .
l i ...
well , sir , uh ... you said you wanted me to show me that , uh , piece of jade?
jade?
you know what?
if you have work to do ... we'll do this some other time .
yes , i do . l i ...
okay .
thank you .
sorry , sir .
that's all i could think of to extricate you .
you realize there's no piece of jade .
yes , i get it .
i get it .
there's no jade .
hey , everything okay?
so far our conspiracy has gone undetected .
perfect .
i'm taking you to your shrink right now .
listen .
same drill tomorrow , chou .
don't worry .
i'll practice casual banter .
very good .
good .
nice to see you .
to observe val waxman directing ... one would think he has no idea what he's doing .
i wonder if he is one of those cinema geniuses ... who thrive on chaos , like fellini .
he always seems distracted .
he never looks anyone in the eye ... and must be juggling a million things in his mind at once .
it's easy to see why his reputation is one of an eccentric .
i notice , too , as the weeks go by ... what a great interest he has in the photography ...
