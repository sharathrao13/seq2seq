always considering the best interest ... . . . and well being of the child .
therefore , you may make visitation . . . . . . every other week and christmas eve . . . . . . and on easter sunday , wearing your pretty easter outfits .
your honor , my ex husband is addicted to pills and he's a thief !
because of his record , i lost my job as a secretary for the fbl .
he was the finest high school tailback i ever saw .
of course he's had his run ins with the law , but he's . . . . . . made his accommodations with the authorities .
being an informer for the vice squad . . . . . . hardly qualifies him to raise a seven year old !
neither does being a mother without a job !
but i lost it because of him !
little lady . . . . . . my decision is final .
next case .
the big man's here !
when does she go on?
pretty soon , jerry .
welcome to eager beaver , gentlemen .
thank you .
keep it close .
keep it very close .
you got it .
last stop , okay?
what do you say , congressman?
poontang .
the night is young and full of promise , my boy .
great !
now look , this has to be the last one .
now i told
come on !
we got a rehearsal tomorrow .
melissa thinks i'm in temple .
what if she calls?
we've got the legendary twin temples from fort lauderdale .
miss urbana sprawl wrapping up on the great stage .
nice spot , isn't it , erb?
it's very uplifting , sir .
jerry , the usual evian with lime?
please .
from paris , france . . . . . . put it together for the fabulous monique , jr . !
oh , my god .
i love you !
that song is killing me !
those babies gonna wind up in traction , you don't play some ballads .
god , it's freezing !
they could store meat in here .
in fact , they do store meat in here .
no , i've been trying all day !
are you positive?
no , thank you .
can't reach her?
darrell's phone's out of order .
i just know he's moved with her again to some new dump .
god , what a nightmare !
he drives around with her in that van .
drinking , taking pills . . . .
he doesn't even think about putting a seat belt on her .
he's a dirtbag !
you hang in there , honey .
you'll get angela back .
that judge will see the light .
it's expensive light , i'll tell you that .
it's gonna cost me $1 5, 000 for this appeal .
is there even a chance i can make that in six weeks?
you'll have to dance day and night and hope some arab sheik shows up .
i love you , girls , i do .
but i can't work here when i go back to court .
your honor , i found a new job .
i'm working at the eager beaver .
it's honest work .
you have nothing to be ashamed of .
i know that and you know that .
but the judge won't .
not him .
god , i still get nauseous before i have to go out there .
you'll get over it .
really?
i can't imagine that .
you guys having a good time?
here's the lucky guy !
you've come to the right place .
monique !
look at these hunks !
we're having a party !
keep an eye on them bachelors .
they look like real trouble .
it's time to strap yourselves in because you are going for a ride !
in her eighth week here . . . . . . put your hands together and make her feel good .
for the one , the only erin grant !
how about that !
larry king's at table six .
what's he wearing?
tank top and gold chains that's larry , all right .
how do i look?
better than me .
that ain't easy .
you talk to her?
darrell's phone's out of order .
i think he moved again .
i'd embrace the opportunity to maim his white ass up .
that's really thoughtful , but i don't think it'd help me in court .
erin , come on .
i can't have an empty stage .
man , let the chumps wait !
going to the head .
you'll behave?
an angel appeared .
an angel of pure delight .
go , paul !
i'm getting married this weekend to melissa .
you love her?
very much .
then go home to her .
shad !
shad !
listen up !
the flesh farm is killing us and you know why?
they have free buffalo wings .
their girls are hookers .
no , because their girls dance fast .
and fast means sweat .
and sweat . . . . . . means drinking !
oh , my god !
what was that?
i got this .
coming through .
move out of the way .
way to go , davey !
back up !
back the hell up !
you all right?
fine .
how about this guy?
good thing he was drunk .
you could've gotten hurt .
on the main stage , our lost little pussycat .
put your hands together for the one , the only miss sabrina hepburn !
meow !
i leave you alone for five minutes !
will you get in?
watch your foot , stupid .
malcolm's gonna shit a brick .
thank you .
did i touch any girls?
not this time , but you were recognized .
okay?
happy?
how are you , little angel?
i'm fine , thank you .
kids just tear me up .
she's a brave one .
you'll be in my prayers .
god bless you , ma'am .
last stop , little 'un .
daddy , you're mean !
evers and jennings .
this is the new model , the x1 2 .
you're happy?
oh , mucho happy .
mucho happy?
get in the van .
mucho , mucho , mucho !
get in .
we're in a loading zone .
we don't wanna break the law .
daddy , did you tell mommy that we moved?
of course i did , buttercup .
of course i did .
how about a wine cooler , erin?
i got mango , passion fruit
water would be just fine , alberto .
thanks .
rita , the reason i stopped by is darrell's moved again . . . . . . and i need his new phone number .
yeah?
well , you come to the wrong place .
i hardly sleep nights and then i break out into
look , erin , i got no idea where our brother is , okay?
shit !
they got the cat !
wolves got no restraint .
careful , sweetie .
shut up !
she's all caught up with them cubs .
some of the guys down at the nuclear plant . . . . . . they were asking me if you'd do , like . . . . . . private parties .
i don't think so .
oh , that's a shame .
because i'll bet that you are a great dancer .
alberto , i'll go crazy if i don't get darrell's new number .
i promised angie i would call her every day and
i hear he moved , darrell .
alberto , where is he?
you have to ask rita about that .
he calls here about twice a week .
collect .
need money , as usual . . . . . . but he don't speak to me .
got no respect for me even though i am . . . . . . a professional man .
you're looking real good .
oh , god , i've got such a headache .
oh , yeah?
you want some advil?
that would be so great .
well now , you sit right here .
i'm gonna fix up that mean old headache .
never mind .
i've gotta run , but thanks anyhow .
deerfield beach?
we had a good day , baby .
phone's ringing .
think it's mama?
no , little 'un .
i talked to her and she's too busy to call you .
damn him !
nice leg .
maybe i'll take it home .
i recommend you let go .
here's 500 , baby .
what'd you say?
what's with princess di tonight?
her husband disappeared with the kid again .
i don't suppose you'd accept this in appreciation .
no need .
senor cucaracha here is gonna make me rich .
oh , my god !
is that a roach?
no , it's a fucking shrimp .
move , you're in my light .
get some manners , mister !
so this is the new brainstorm?
the wall street journal says this is the hottest selling yogurt .
i'll bring this in . . . . . . say my hair fell off from the shock .
boom .
they pay off bigtime .
lawyer thinks it's a genius idea .
your lawyer has an office over a video store .
call me a dreamer .
i don't wanna be a bouncer forever .
erin !
note from jerry !
what did it say?
i can help you get your daughter back .
i ask nothing in return but a kind smile .
yeah , right !
he's a weirdo .
you guys !
he is totally harmless .
come on !
also , could you add kenny g to your routine?
anything from his christmas album .
that's sweet .
we could do a christmas show here !
seriously , it couldn't hurt to talk to him , right?
only talking , no touching .
ladies !
attention !
major announcement .
major asshole .
i heard that .
on monday , i'm installing a ring .
mud wrestling?
this is something that's really happening .
it's contemporary .
it's now .
and it's creamed corn wrestling .
corn?
corn wrestling?
that's disgusting !
i'm not putting these in corn .
no way !
what?
no , it's terrific !
in lsrael , we did falafel wrestling .
all the girls broke out in hives everywhere .
and i mean , everywhere !
well , falafel , sure .
this is corn !
what is this , a mutiny?
i don't think so .
no chance that i'm gonna roll around naked in creamed corn . . . . . . with drunken yahoos trying to stick niblets up my hoo hah .
not naked .
topless .
health department won't go for naked .
not with food products .
i always liked the health department .
so you'll think about it?
not for one second .
erin !
please !
you're getting a big following here .
even with that shit music , the guys love you .
you go into the corn , you set a great example to the other girls .
i got it !
how about pasta wrestling?
now , that's classy .
linguine , rigatoni?
just nothing with meat or fish .
orly , if i wanted to wrestle . . . . . . i would've joined the world wrestling federation .
and speaking of real class?
what's the problem?
we hate these .
they degrade women and beavers .
i'll take it under advisement .
but just the coasters and the napkins .
not the sign .
that's a landmark !
good night , darlin '.
for you , miss grant .
they're beautiful , jerry .
thank you .
you can call me erin
i can't .
i worship you too much .
believe me . . . . . . i'm no one to be worshiped .
i'm just trying to make a living .
i worship your essence .
if you were a nurse or a teacher , i'd feel the same .
you receive my note?
i did and , you know , i was wondering what you had in mind .
i believe i can help you get your daughter back .
i believe i can get to judge fingerhut .
how?
through . . . . . . a certain congressman who i'm certain will listen to me . . . . . . because i know some things .
things?
really?
well , you know what , jerry?
you're really a terrific guy . . . . . . and so supportive of me ever since i started here .
maybe you shouldn't
just give me a week .
good night , my precious .
melissa thinks i was in synagogue the night this happened .
what do i tell her?
you left synagogue and a gang of skinheads jumped you .
in the meantime , we'll develop these , we'll see what we have .
i see mucho damages .
these strip joints are insured up the ass .
my neck really feels better , uncle al .
oh , yeah?
how's it feel now?
call little caesar's .
order me a health pizza .
get some for yourself .
no , thank you , sir .
i'm dieting .
i'll just grab a yogurt out of the fridge .
this is a major disaster !
major .
unbelievable .
without doubt . . . . . . the most asinine piece of human behavior .
it's never gonna happen again , malcolm .
i've got it under control .
you see . . . . . . i just love naked women .
it's a character flaw .
god's testing me
oh , will you shut up !
you idiot .
you can't talk to me like that .
i'm a u. s. congressman .
i can't?
you go psycho in a titty bar six weeks before the election .
what should i call you?
winston fucking churchill?
it was all i could do to keep . . . . . . willie rojo from strangling you with his bare hands .
everybody has a bad night .
if you're under pressure like we are , under the public eye
who recognized me?
his name . . . . . . is jerry killian .
and he's waiting outside .
now?
now .
we gotta move on this before we get eaten alive .
move on what?
if this is a shakedown , get willie to pay them like always .
why drag me into it  because it's not about money .
it's not?
no .
he wants you to persuade judge fingerhut . . . . . . to reverse a child custody case for some stripper .
who he's porking?
it's disgraceful to have a man like me deal with
he's not porking her .
well , then , why does he care?
because he's nuts !
that's why he's dangerous .
if he was porking her , at least i could deal with him man to man . . . . . . but this is fruitcake love .
i mean , fingerhut's a democrat .
he won't listen to me .
you can't say that to this little creep , davey .
you gotta string him along .
bullshit him .
use the old . . . . . . dilbeck charm .
what if he doesn't go for it?
then we have a serious problem .
mr. killian !
come in and meet congressman dilbeck .
i'll bet that's jerry killian .
lucy !
come here .
come on .
how perfect is this?
you know , i was just thinking . . . . . . is this really on the same planet as miami?
i can read .
where's andy?
he's been fishing since eight .
dad !
dad !
there's a floater !
he's still got his glasses on .
go tell mom to call the police .
you're the police .
i'm the miami police .
we just need the local law here .
go on .
man !
of all the lakes . . . . . . in all the counties . . . . . . in all the world . . . . . . you gotta float up in mine .
you son of a bitch .
mama !
hey , come here !
i've been trying to reach you , baby .
heard you stole my sister's mail !
that's a federal offense .
wait for mommy .
i'm gonna go talk to daddy .
why do you keep moving?
how will she make any friends?
aren't we the child psych
it has nothing to do with child psychology , you moron !
where's she going to school?
opa locka?
deerfield beach?
have you even thought about it?
yeah , i thought about it plenty .
hey , you only got two hours !
that's what the judge ruled right there from that bench !
i'll be right behind you just in case you're thinking about snatching her !
mommy , does " snatch " mean " kidnap "?
how did you get so smart?
is free willy back yet?
still out .
people are pigs .
sit on movies like they own them .
freak .
it's shad .
open up .
it wasn't me .
it was a temp .
where's perry mason?
our good friend , mr. shad !
come on in , we have lots to discuss .
no shit .
if i buzz twice , you say my mother's on the line .
she has chest pains .
what do you mean he's a wheelchair salesman?
there's one nice thing about hospitals .
a lot of kids in chairs are really sick , and i wave at them . . . . . . and they smile just like on jerry lewis .
and do you do this every day?
on fridays i stay with aunt rita .
that's a wholesome environment .
she has real wolves .
i don't want you touching those animals .
they're not like dogs .
time .
time .
i love you more than anything in the world .
you know that in your heart .
mommy?
what , baby?
do you know those dolls you got me?
daddy says he can't find them anywhere .
we'll get you new ones .
i love you .
bye , baby .
i love you .
hey , let's go !
all right , you go on .
i'll bring your stuff .
hey , baby !
did you have a good day?
good .
she told me about your new profession .
really admirable .
at least i ain't naked .
at least i ain't naked "?
you get caught using that child in a felony . . . . . . and family services will put her  no way i'd get caught .
got me one of them doctor's jackets and a stethoscope .
look like one of them dudes on er .
darrell , would you think for once in your life?
i don't need no stripper telling me how to behave .
i'll see you in two weeks .
you ready?
you know where that was taken?
your mama's birthday party .
the eager beaver .
can you identify those people?
yeah , this old fool .
erin .
erin's the stripper?
what'd you say?
erin's the stripper .
dancer , fat ass .
she's a dancer !
the young man who was so savagely beaten . . . . . . is my client , paul guber .
no shit .
too bad for him .
i don't think so .
the third person in that photo is none other than . . . . . . david l. dilbeck .
so what?
do you follow politics , mr. shad?
do i look like i follow politics?
david dilbeck is the u. s. congressman . . . . . . from the fifth district .
he's up for reelection soon .
you gonna put the squeeze on him .
nice .
what that gotta do with me?
i'll give you 10 % of the squeeze .
is this conceivably as big as the yogurt deal?
as big "?
congressman dilbeck is chairman of the subcommittee on sugar , okay?
the rojo family cannot allow him to lose .
because their price supports are worth hundreds of millions of dollars .
and quite frankly , mr. shad . . . . . . this is the opportunity of a lifetime .
good .
just keep erin out of it .
i'll do my best .
she's out .
erin is out .
erin who?
charming spot .
look .
steven spielberg's house .
i wish he'd come in here .
i'm sure he would have big hots for me .
you'd turn his whole life around .
steven spielberg's shower .
can you imagine me and him in that shower?
oh , that cute little beard !
yours or his?
hey , jerry , it's erin grant .
what a long beep .
someone's waiting for you .
maybe you're out of town . . . .
i'm just calling to see about that legal matter we discussed .
if you get a chance , just give me a call at the club .
thanks , bye .
michael jordan's at table eight !
great .
say hello to the fantastic monique , jr . !
lieutenant garcia with homicide .
what's he want with erin?
got no idea .
all i need is scandal .
what do you know about prozac?
it makes you happy .
there's side effects .
like what?
limp noodle .
who cares?
i haven't had a hard on since i started running this place .
closest i got was sea world .
porpoise got me hot .
what the fuck you telling me that for?
i'm going next door .
see what ling's up to .
drowned?
oh , my god .
he had pictures of you all over his apartment .
he was a really big fan .
he used to bring me flowers
he was just a fan?
there was no touching?
this has been a real pleasure .
i dance so i must turn tricks .
nice way to open a conversation .
i understand you're a hooker?
you don't work in a library here .
i'm trying to figure out the man's life .
he was a customer .
that's all i know about his life .
except that it's over .
i apologize .
sincerely .
look , i'm real i'm nowhere on this .
i could use some please give me a minute?
please?
so where did this happen?
lake okeechobee .
it's where i made the serious mistake of taking my vacation .
your family?
nice .
it's not the kind of place you'd expect to encounter a homicide .
homicide?
you said he drowned .
no , we did an autopsy .
the water in his lungs , they come up clean .
there was tap water in his lungs?
exactly .
somebody killed him , like in a bathtub , then dumped the body in a lake .
do you read mysteries?
up till three months ago , i worked at the fbi in miami .
a secretary .
until i got fired for having a defective husband .
i'm in a pretty bad custody fight .
jerry was trying to help me .
from the shores of the dead sea . . . . . . a decorated nurse in the lsraeli army . . . . . . say shalom to the fabulous ariel sharon !
could we go outside?
i could really use some air .
oh , mr. orly !
what a wonderful surprise .
nice to be in quality club , eh?
yeah , if you like freak shows .
ling !
ling !
get over here !
move it !
excuse me .
i'm sorry .
but that's mr. chris rojo . . . . . . of the sugar rojos .
typical of the kind of rich big shots we get here .
is this the place where i met my angel?
i don't know which angel you're referring to .
a congressman?
you mean a u. s. congressman?
well , he wasn't specific who it was .
i told him it was bananas . . . . . . and maybe it was better that he stayed out of it .
on wednesday , there was an incident , a guy with a bottle
oh , he was a total whack job .
drunk out of his mind .
can you remember , was mr. killian here?
no , not offhand , but maybe .
think about that and let me know .
here's all my numbers .
once again , i apologize .
i mean , for any aspersions .
you wanna make it up to me?
i beg your pardon?
i need a favor .
you've got friends on the vice squad?
they're not my bosom buddies .
my ex husband's an informant .
it's why this idiot judge gave him custody .
are you joking?
i wish .
but i was thinking , if vice dumped him as an informer . . . . . . when my appeal came up in six weeks . . . . . . i could then say my ex husband is unfit .
he's such a criminal  wait a minute .
he's a criminal?
your ex?
he's a criminal?
he steals wheelchairs .
thank you very much .
all right , let me see what i can do .
good night .
you know , not having her around . . . . . . it's like my heart is missing .
i'm sure .
let me see what i can do .
good night .
good night .
how much you pay them?
i think they're up to $30 a day .
subtract room and board , booze and smokes .
you know , who knows?
maybe they pay us !
hell of a business .
it's the best !
we gotta protect it , my friend , right?
son , i've been protecting your family for 20 years .
you're the greatest , man !
i'm saying , until the election , no more girls , huh?
bring your wife down here for a weekend .
what's her name?
alice?
mary pat .
mary pat .
chris , i met an angel .
i mean , she's a dancer .
she's so pure and clean .
not like the rest of these whores .
if i could be with her  what?
you'd be a good boy?
i'd be perfect .
i'd be perfect .
i swear i would !
i would stop going to clubs .
i would stop drinking .
i would just lead a regular life , you know?
with my wife and a steady mistress .
and i would have a decent life .
so let's do it !
where'd you see her?
my brain has just turned to shit .
that's why you're in congress !
you're probably right .
who is it?
it's lieutenant garcia .
is it a bad time now?
no , just a second .
i was rehearsing .
morning .
i was nearby .
i probably should've call
no , no , it's fine .
please come on in .
thank you .
can i get you some coffee or english muffin?
no , no , thanks .
you know , i was thinking . . . . . . and if i had to guess , i would say . . . . . . that jerry was probably there because he was there most nights .
so do you know anything new?
actually , i have some good news . . . . . . and i have some mediocre news .
the good news is darrell lost his informant status .
9 : 00 this morning .
vice thought his information was bogus anyway .
this is great !
now in six weeks , i can go to the judge
that's the mediocre part .
judge fingerhut had a heart attack early this morning . . . . . . at a porno theater on ocean .
don't tell me that !
he was doa . . . . . . at don shula hospital .
anyway , i called around , and the earliest . . . .
it'll be six months before your appeal's heard .
the system is all backed up .
i can't allow her to stay with him for another six months !
there's nothing you can do from a legal standpoint .
absolutely nothing .
i understand .
is today friday?
yeah , it's friday .
i gotta run now .
how are you?
all right .
you're wonderful , mr. dilbeck !
shalom , darlin '.
shalom to you .
manischewitz !
congressman .
alan mordecai .
alan , how you been?
fine , sir .
congressman , i brought a little souvenir for you .
obviously , the ramifications of that , if it were to become public
is this me?
yes , i'm afraid so .
if this became public , it would be devastating . . . . . . and i'd like to avoid that .
it's her .
it's my angel .
heel !
slow down !
heel , will you?
are you going to your house , mama?
no , we're going to our house .
for the whole day?
even better .
really?
really .
you snatched me , didn't you?
i guess i did .
you sure did .
come on , pumpkin .
zippity doo dah .
i didn't know she had a child .
of course you
she's divorced , but the husband has custody .
remember?
she's carrying numerous bags .
that doesn't look like just a visitation , does it , erb?
i'll look into it .
check custody status of ms. erin grant .
god , give me strength .
what an extraordinary creature .
how perfect in every detail .
davey , you promised you'd behave until after the election .
you don't understand .
this is love .
please .
i won't campaign . . . . . . until i can possess . . . . . . her actual velvet self .
in the meantime , i want you to bring me something .
something of hers .
something . . . . . . personal to tide me over .
how personal?
intensely personal .
am i a good help?
honey , you are the best laundry assistant i've ever had .
all right , let's hit the road , jack .
who's jack?
it's just an expression .
come on .
this is some picture .
it's fatal .
i don't accede to blackmail .
willie , i agree with you in principle . . . . . . but this gets out , we're in a bigtime shitstorm .
pop , pay the guy off .
you got a cancer , you talk nice to it?
no .
you cut it out .
willie .
we can't operate like we're in the funeral business .
i'd rather buy cops than pay blackmail .
understood?
i just think we should consider other options .
understood?
what else?
a connected matter .
davey wants this stripper , and i'd like to use the boat .
that way , we can control the situation .
she's the girl from the picture?
that's correct .
what does she know?
well , we gotta find out .
the good news is she got custody illegally , so she's vulnerable .
vulnerable isn't good enough .
i say let davey have his fun .
then lose her .
willie , willie .
first , let's determine whether she can hurt us or not .
i'm sure she's just another dumb whore .
for her sake , i hope so .
phooey !
i go back three .
this is complicated .
it's easy .
all right , is it your turn?
you stay here with us , sweetie .
mama's orders .
everybody , listen up .
this is lorelei !
formerly of the flesh farm .
she and her snake , monty python , have signed an exclusive . . . . . . contract with us .
you've got a snake?

the law is the law .
i'll screw around here .
if you like , i'll lose your paperwork .
he makes bail , she's his .
i should split and take her to new england .
understand this .
if you split without formal custody , you'll lose her forever .
i've dealt with family services .
they are pencil pushers .
this is by the book .
i'm dealing with a maniac .
i understand .
i repeat , you can't take off .
you cannot .
you might have a bigger problem .
i can't have a bigger problem !
look at this .
any of these clowns the one who might have assaulted mr. guber?
this clown .
you're positive?
absolutely .
who is he?
he looks like that guy on f troop .
that's congressman dilbeck .
this nut is a congressman?
you haven't heard from him?
from any of his staff?
wait .
this is who jerry was talking about .
are you saying i am in danger from a congressman?
no .

i think that's in both our interests .
how did i get so popular?
hush , little baby don 't you cry

pumpkin pie .
oh , you're awake .
can mommy put you down?
no .
fair enough .
brush your teeth .

urbana said that she'd

i can't do that .

have we ever met before?
but actually , i have seen . . . . . . many , many beautiful photographs of you .
well , i'm honored .
and a congressman .
very successful congressman you must be .
this is not my boat .
it belongs to a very close friend of mine .
do you like dino?
dean's great , yeah .
but you know , i've brought my own .
do you care for the artist formerly known as prince?
i care for you .

meryl streep stripped?
one of the best .
chesty la france .
that was meryl .
chesty la france .

a diamond ring .
a lexus .
i'll get you a condo on the beach . just be my girlfriend .
can't do that .
why not?
i love you .
you don't know what i've done for you recently .
really?
and what was that?
i talked to judge fingerhut about your daughter .
you did?
and how did you know about my case?
little birdie told me .
it must have been a little old birdie who knew me very well .
who " is not important .
come on now .
not just a little hint .
i can't do that .
but i know the new judge .
he's a very good friend of mine .
the honorable jack goldberg .
he'll be more amenable .
darlin ', if you just come into davey's life . . . . . . good things will happen .
you don't know how much i worship you .
how much?
i sent my aide , erb , over to your laundromat .
he brought back some of your lint .
my lint?
fresh . . . . . . hot lint .
and what did you do with that fresh , hot lint?
i'm afraid i made love to it .
close your eyes .
i've got a little surprise for you .
keep them closed .
no peeking .
don't invade my private life again or i'll kill you .
you understand?
show's over , big boy .
you'll come back tomorrow?
same time?
i don't think so .
i'll give you $5, 000 .
five thousand dollars for no sex?
you love me that much .
just the touch of your hand sets my pecker on fire .
maybe you should see a doctor .
same time tomorrow?
if i come , can we talk more about my case?
we can talk about anything .
as long as you're naked .
we'll see .
good evening .
you don't know me .
i'm malcolm moldovsky .
dilbeck's right hand .
you must be a very busy man .
touch .
i wish to give you some advice . . . . . . about your adorable little daughter , angela .
what about her?
your custody of her is illegal .
that's just temporary until the appeal gets heard
please , please , miss grant .
really , it's of no concern to us .
as long as you refuse to cooperate with certain individuals . . . . . . who seek to harm and slur congressman dilbeck . . . . . . for their own selfish political gain .
i don't know what you're talking about .
excuse me .
perhaps you don't .
but what a pity if angela were to be placed in a state home .
pretty grim , most of them .
a lot of strange people working there .
i'd recommend that you cooperate with us for the child's sake .
which means you talk to no one about tonight . . .
. . . or any night .
understood?
of course .
good .
now if you'll excuse me . . . . . . i'd better toss the congressman into a cold shower .
by the way , i can see why he's so taken by your charms .
good night .
watch your step on the gangplank .
she ain't dumb enough .
try anything?
no .
he ask you back?
no .
aren't we miss talkative tonight?
i'm a little tired .
what's the matter , baby?
come on .
monty .
this reptile's a freaking lemon .
who are you?
help !
so how did it go?
fine .
no problems?
no , none .
but no information .
zero .
look , i gotta run , you know .
angela's wiped .
i'll see you later , okay?
come on , come on .

i'm doing something .
i'm protecting you .

here comes that brilliant and charming attorney of yours , mr. mordecai .
found him 400 yards offshore .
now show him the rest of his kisser .
crabs find lawyers a particular delicacy .
looks like lasagna .
cover that shit up .
you wanna tell me why your name was on his calendar for tomorrow?
i was involved in litigation with a yogurt company .
from my limited experience , this isn't something . . . . . . a yogurt company would ordinarily do .
he represented the kid who got mauled at your club .
now that i find fascinating , shad .
he had a picture .
man , i'm gonna lose it .
no , no .
a picture of what?
a legislator?
yeah , beating a kid's ass .
where's the original?
i got no idea .
here , freshen up .
all right , thanks .
can i interest you in dessert?
just the check .
good night .
dilbeck didn't invite her back?
she said no .
that's good .
i don't think she should go there again , even with you .
she seemed all edgy tonight .
man , she got her moods .
could be that time of month .
so you're like the gynecologist bouncer , bouncer gynecologist .
i just watch out for the girl .
so do l .
that's a grand total of two people in florida .
the higher ups in my department aren't pushing this investigation .
because of this congressman?
bingo .
we got two homicides here , and nobody gives a shit .
and i'm worried about that girl .
she's out there all by herself .
where's the sheriff?
hello , city desk?
it is an unusual time for a news conference . . . . . . but the congressman feels it will dramatize his message .
we'll send a camera crew .
confirm?
there won't be any need to confirm .
got everything .
thank you .
good morning , pumpkin .

playing polo with donald trump , okay?
it says here you take two every four hours with a bowl of milk .
sounds good to me .
i said two !

throw down a spade or seven unless you have an eight .
then you can change suits .
so that's why they call it crazy eights .
when are you coming back?
by two .
but i hope you will be asleep .
we'll take care of her .
don't worry .
you're going out?
i'll be back by two .

you're going to the boat?
not without me .
i'll be late .
listen up .
you said you weren't going .
i didn't want anybody to know .
like who?
garcia .
then just say , " don't tell garcia . " what's up?
they'll put angela in a foster home if i don't keep my mouth shut .
says who?
dilbeck's guy , that creep moldovsky .
promise me you will stay with her every second .
i need to know that .
i can't let you go there alone .
they're gonna pay me $5, 000 .
i need the money .
