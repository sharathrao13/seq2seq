richard?
is that you?
did you bring the pom poms?
i brought something to help you sleep .
what the fuck? !
my physics test .
i got a b+ .
you are a genius .
don't .
i have something for you .
what is this?
you're quite the slut .
what?
what? !
how long has he been here?
nurse on the night shift said he came in about 4 .
how are you feeling?
i'm okay .
i'm a little sore , but ....
what are you doing here?
i figured you'd want an immediate report .
yeah , i do .
so?
we got everything .
excellent .
the boots?
that's an affirmative .
and a pair of tin snips , and a phillips head , traces of blood .
and a finger , right?
was it in a jar behind a stack of magazines ... ... or in the freezer under the turkey thigh?
behind the vanilla fudge ice cream .
good work .
all you need now is a confession .
there won't be one .
feathers committed suicide last night .
suicide?
yeah .
it was a gun to the head .
powder burns , gsr on his right hand .
ever heard of a ritual mutilator , an impulsive serial type killer ... ... committing suicide?
don't do that .
i can't think of one .
psychos want to get caught .
lie down .
i'm actually feeling a lot better , thank you .
these kids did this .
they're not even hiding it .
they want us to know .
so let's get to know them a little better .
turn around .
we got ray on this .
why did he run if he didn't do it?
there's a reason .
are you jealous because i got him ... ... or are you so obsessed with richard you're not thinking?
i'm sorry
you've been angling for this for a while , taking over the case !
they made me take it because they think you're losing it !
who thinks i'm losing it?
who?
rod?
i don't care if i'm losing it .
i'm right .
how did you come by this?
it was the weirdest thing .
i was driving by the house ... ... the trash can got knocked over , and the stuff fell out .
what a break .
some of this will be the mom's , some will be the boy's .
what is this?
don't ask , don't tell .
we won't know until we get the report if it matches the puke's dna .
lucky he gave us some blood with his dinner .
be sure to get a signed purchase order .
when will we know?
depends on the lab .
want me to call him?
no !
last time i had to calm him down .
just make it fast .
i'll take care of it .
see you .
what's this?
a purchase order for the dna  i know what it is .
this case is closed .
closed !
now , if you can't understand that , then maybe we
you need some time off?
nope , i'm fine .
you're not fine .
you're brilliant sometimes , but never really fine .
you want to see doc sluzer again?
no .
then no more on this case .
not another minute , not another penny .
i've about had it with you .
you hear me?
hi , it's cass .
i'll need another day or two on that purchase order .
no , just bookkeeping , changing the software , things like that .
so you'll run an analysis on that puke?
thanks , honey .
i'm sorry .
i shouldn't have done it .
come on !
you threw up?
why didn't you tell me?
i don't remember doing it .
he doesn't remember .
what if they i. d. you?
with the dna , can they do that?
i doubt it .
the stomach acids usually eat away
you doubt it?
i doubt it .
it could put us in the electric chair !
gas chamber .
what?
california uses a gas chamber .
that's very informative .
it doesn't matter .
no , thank you .
you told her you tutor me too?
what are you thinking?
if she found out on her own ... ... and i hadn't mentioned it , it would look even worse !
they have nothing .
they have nothing on me .
don't worry , i'm not a backstabber like you , richard .
how am i a back?
i'm not the one talking , giving away all the information ... ... trying to get us caught because i'm a bitch !
don't talk to me like that .
i'll talk to you how i want to .
i trust you with forensic stuff , and you have no idea what you're talking about !
you're supposed to be smart !
stop .
no , you're not smart , you're dumb !
stop !
i'm sorry .
come here .
that's a good boy .
you're not still mad about that girl , are you?
let's just stick together and stay calm until this is over , okay?
and then what?
and then what?
justin?
where are you going?
we can't be seen together .
do you think this is some kind of game?
come on , come on .
this is sam kennedy .
i'm not here to take your call
what are you doing here?
what are you doing here?
do you want something?
like what?
i don't know .
everybody wants something , don't they?
do they?
they just don't know how to ask for it .
what do you want?
richard , get out of the way .
you think i'm too young?
there was a killer at your school .
the whole time , somebody you were close to .
what do you mean?
raymond feathers .
you guys were friends , right?
with that degenerate?
no .
he didn't really have many friends .
he just ....
i don't know .
you know , even his old lady left him .
so you're friends with his old lady too?
you're a tease .
you lead guys on and then push them away .
but i think ... ... you like to fight .
you want it , but you need to fight about it .
no .
you don't have to do anything .
you have no choice .
you can't handle it , so you're leaving?
this is part of it !
damn it !
thank you , detective .
i bet you did this with every guy you ever dated .
tell me i'm wrong .
lf i can link richard to feathers  you can't stop .
i'm sorry about what i said .
i'm just a little messed up right now , but hear me out , as a friend .
just as a friend , okay?
thank you .
i saw richard and justin tonight .
they lied , they know each other .
really?
they barely have parents .
they're like orphans with credit cards .
school's too easy .
they don't have jobs or chores .
nothing's expected of them .
nothing they do matters .
so they figured , " why not kill somebody?
maybe i'm wrong , but tell rod you want to keep the case open .
what happened between you and richard tonight?
did you hit him?
in the face?
no .
no , it wasn't like that , it was
it was an acci
rod knows?
he got a call from richard's father .
he'll make you see the department shrink about this .
no .
no shrink .
it's not gonna work .
i know what i am .
i'm just not
okay .
so nobody wants to work with me?
that's okay .
but i'm a good cop .
and if what i say is right , and we let these kids go , and they do it again ....
so please just talk to rod , you're the only one he'll listen to .
i'll call him in the morning .
call him now , he's still up .
back off !
if rod says yes ... ... maybe you could even hang around the school and make them nervous .
we have papers due tomorrow , no excuses .
support your conclusions , having a thesis isn't enough .
i want real arguments with quotations and sources .
sam kennedy , san benito police .
nice to meet you .
lisa !
sam kennedy , from san benito police .
start time .
let's see ....
it's me .
i know how they did it .
now we need to know why .
i can help with that .
i got someone here you ought to talk to .
rod , look at the dna .
the vomit is a perfect match with justin .
who paid for this?
cassie , out of her own pocket .
you'd need a jury of 12 forensic experts .
that's why we need a confession from one of them .
they'll talk without an attorney?
they want to prove they're smarter than we are .
okay .
so where's the other one?
who?
the hot one .
not here .
you get to work with her everyday?
yeah .
i should become a cop .
so , what's up with ray?
i hear he's like a serial killer or something .
well , actually , we have a theory on that .
it involves you and justin .
it's just a theory .
can i lay it out for you?
yeah .
therefore ... ... every truly free act is a crime , for crime sets one apart ... ... from the machinery of mass society .
it can't be a crime of profit or passion , but gratuitous and random .
crime as philosophy , as freedom .
interesting .
do you believe it?
it's a school paper .
you have to write something .
i enjoy taking indefensible positions and creating an argument for them .
but do you believe it?
so then the question is , how did you pick the victim?
was it random?
i mean , that's the way i'd do it .
that one right there , with the flowers .
she's perfect .
no , she's too skinny .
you understand what random means?
we don't choose .
don't talk to me like i'm a moron .
we have to follow the plan
this one !
what about this one?
don't get impatient .
wait a second .
pull up , where the girl is loading the groceries .
okay .
but you lose the point of a philosophical crime if you feel guilty .
how do you mean?
if you kill somebody to prove you're free , and then throw up
i didn't .
what are you talking about?
richard didn't feel guilty .
he's free , justin .
you're not .
relax .
let them wonder what we're up to .
now go in .
your coffee .
you can't smoke in here .
come on .
are we almost done?
take a seat .
so ray was an inspired choice .
but the great thing ... ... was how subtly you planted the fibers and hairs and stuff .
i got your product .
you did ray , right?
wasn't he your friend?
you told him to hide in his trailer , didn't you?
what are you talking about?
you went home , you said hello to your mother .
it took you 10 minutes to walk home from the restaurant .
mother , i'm home .
you said you had to do schoolwork so she wouldn't look in .
and she didn't .
she never did , did she?
i was with six friends all night .
you know that .
you talked to them .
the night , sure , but not the day .
that's the secret .
you weren't there at night .
the thing that always confused me was the muddy footprints in the house .
you know?
the planting bed was dry , so where did they come from?
it was you at the house .
justin would not have walked through the wet beds .
that was exactly 3 : 30 .
how long did you wait for her to come home?
you didn't kill her there .
i gotta say , that was a stroke of genius .
did you think it up , or was it justin?
i don't know what you're saying .
that helped us figure out the real timetable .
that gave you time to get home for the study group .
i'll go get some cash for the pizza .
you told them you were going to the atm to get cash .
and you did .
and i did .
then you hurried back .
that took five minutes .
it took five minutes .
now we're talking .
but you were gone 15 .
what are you looking at?
richard killed her .
didn't he , justin?
i think it was justin .
let me tell you something .
it'll be the most important thing you ever hear .
more important than the instructions on the sats and aps .
the person who actually killed olivia lake is gonna be executed .
or , at best , go to jail for life .
in your case that'd be about 60 years .
but the other one , who didn't actually kill her , if he cooperates ... ... will have a chance at a real life .
richard was back in the study group by 9 : 25 .
so you must have dumped the body .
the planning was easy ... ... but now you had to actually do it .
and that's why the postmortem wounds were so tentative .
you were trying to be like richard , but you couldn't .
you weren't that free .
thank god .
go to hell .
my guy won't roll .
i figured he'd be the one .
no .
let's talk about lisa .
she went out with richard?
briefly .
then she got interested in justin .
let's use that .
interesting theory , but i can't admit to something i didn't do .
looks like you won't have to .
because justin is talking in there .
justin's here?
he told us about you .
about you and lisa .
which lisa?
so you really need to tell me what happened .
just think of it as a game .
whoever talks first is the winner .
justin says you betrayed him .
he told us about lisa and the tape you made .
justin's talking .
he's gonna win this thing , unless you have something to tell me .
okay , i'm gonna go see .
wait , wait .
come on , sit down .
i have to advise you of certain rights .
the interview is over .
richard's father's lawyer .
charge them or let them go .
another five minutes , we would have had both those kids .
if i ever find out who leaked to the parents , i swear ....
no , that's all right .
yeah , i'll talk to you tomorrow .
justin won't talk , because he needs to prove he's as tough as his buddy .
he's tougher .
yeah , maybe .
that richard , i can't wait till we nail him .
one of them is the doer , and he's going down , but there's something deeper
a narcissistic prick like richard doesn't care about anyone but himself .
he uses justin to feed his ego .
push him around , make him feel like a man .
in five years , no one will care he was homecoming king ... ... or pole vaulting champ .
i pity anyone who gets in his way .
is richard a pole vaulter?
i don't know .
i was using it as an example of , you know ....
look ....
i know about carl hudson .
where did you get that?
this is none of your god this is my matter !
mine !
i knew this girl in high school ... ... smart enough ... ... but she didn't really come from anything .
and to everyone's amazement , the most popular boy liked her .
state pole vaulting champ .
you'd watch him go over that bar in the sunlight ... ... that golden body , it was like ... ... life just couldn't get any more beautiful than that .
and it didn't .
she was 16 when she married him .
seventeen when he knocked out her upper bicuspid .
eighteen when she decided to leave .
he put her in the hospital with a serious concussion .
a week later , when she got out ... ... she started packing , and he was drunk .
he pointed his finger at her .
he said , " you try that again , i'll kill you .
he took another drink ... ... and she headed for the door .
why didn't she wait till he was out?
left for work?
she couldn't , she had to go right then .
why then?
i don't know .
it was because ....
because she ....
it wasn't about getting away from him , it was about standing up to him .
even if it killed her .
i guess so .
so he stabbed her 17 times with a kitchen knife ... ... and dumped her body on a country road .
yeah , ruined my favorite dress .
carl hudson .
cutest boy i ever saw ... ... until richard haywood .
and you're supposed to testify at carl's parole hearing .
what are you gonna say?
nothing .
i'm not going .
i'm not .
you gotta go up there , you have to .
no .
i don't have to .
the girl was jessica marie hudson .
i have nothing to say about her .
you just inherited her scars .
look , i made a deal .
the deal was that she died there .
she's in the ground , and i can go on with my life .
except you can't .
all you think about is carl hudson .
he's every case .
he's every guy you date .
your whole world is carl hudson .
is that the life you're going on with?
did you ever get help for any of this?
yeah .
i became a cop .
you can't just pretend it didn't happen .
it's not that simple , cass .
it has to be .
because if it gets any more complicated , i can't make it .
richard haywood is on line one .
swanson .
so you want to talk to me about this covington woman?
yes , i know all about it .
what can i do for you?
i just thought you'd want to know what really happened .
i thought it was a game .
how do you pick a victim?
how do you get away with it?
we were bored .
i never took it seriously until i walk in the room , and she's laying there ....
did you make a deal with him?
he says he wasn't there  did you make a deal?
i don't make deals over the phone , but if it checks out ...
... and we can get a conviction , i will .
fine .
let's get warrants now .
where are you going?
you're not supposed to leave without telling us .
will you be back for dinner?
justin's not here .
his mother doesn't even know when he left .
similar story here .
what about goldilocks?
get over there and see what she knows .
you should take a look downstairs .
i gotta go .
bye .
i didn't know where else to go .
tell me what's going on .
the cops are asking about you and richard .
i don't know what to say .
we killed a woman .
no , you didn't .
yes , we did .
he made you do it .
it wasn't just richard .
but he drove it .
it was his idea .
you would have never done anything like this by yourself .
he seduced you ... ... just like he seduced me .
you know what you have to do .
you have to tell them everything .
i will .
i don't have any feelings left .
except for you .
that's him .
don't answer it .
where are you?
are you with her?
no .
yes , you are .
and you told her about us , didn't you?
did you tell her everything?
where are you?
i left home .
all right?
i'm gone .
i'm never going back .
it's over .
i know .
we have to turn ourselves in .
and go to prison?
and be punks?
and eat shit for the rest of our lives? !
do you remember what we talked about?
yes .
meet me at the bluff in an hour .
okay?
okay .
i have to meet him .
to do what?
i just have to .
i wish i met you first .
cassie mayweather .
have a seat .
so this is what we talked about .
glory or nothing .
should we say the words for the last time?
one cannot live fully without embracing suicide and crime .
say it .
a pact made with relentless fire that requires that while some live ... ... others die .
on three .
one .
two .
three .
what are you doing?
i have the bullets , right?
what about you?
open your chamber .
open it !
you were gonna watch me kill myself?
they're here at the old wintu lodge .
roger .
that's up off highland road?
so since i have the bullets and the guts to use them ... ... l'll shoot you , and then i'll shoot myself , okay?
no .
no?
why?
would you rather go to prison and be a punk?
or do you think you'll beat prison?
because you made a deal .
you talked .
you talked !
why don't you shoot me?
shoot me in the head , in the heart .
whatever you want .
do it .
doesn't matter anymore .
pull the fucking trigger .
pull it !
come on !
justin , don't .
we have to pay for what we did .
not like that .
put the gun down .
put it down .
please don't .
justin , listen to me .
for me .
come over here , next to me .
don't listen to her .
don't !
hands off !
stay put .
people are on the way .
hey , richard?
you think you're so smart , huh?
justin's smarter than you , remember that .
i got one left .
to hell with it .
every night , the same fucking thing?
listen !
listen to me !
you are not going out that door , jess !
you are not going out that door !
justin , please !
justin , please .
don't !
justin !
justin , don't !
no , no !
don't !
grab it .
i got it .
thank you , thank you .
i'm okay , thank you .
what's gonna happen to me?
since you weren't the actual killer , and what you did down there for me ....
don't worry about it , i'll take care of you .
you all right?
whisper something into my ear .
what?
just anything .
remember what i said about looking for new partners?
are you serious?
where was it?
i want to take that back .
did they find the videotape?
yes .
how's he doing?
he looks okay .
but we're gonna transport him for treatment .
why did you let richard videotape the killing?
that was really stupid , like you guys wanted to get caught .
what are you talking about?
oh , you don't know?
they found a hidden camera in richard's basement .
that's how he filmed himself with lisa .
he filmed the killing too .
the d. a. is looking at it now .
look , whatever is on that tape ....
whatever's on that tape what?
is there really a tape?
maybe i should talk to a lawyer .
absolutely .
no , wait a second .
wait !
i thought richard manipulated you , but it was the other way around .
these marks are from richard's ring when he tried to strangle me .
there are none of these marks on olivia's neck .
richard could have taken off that ring to make it look like ray did it .
the ring has nothing to do with it .
tell me what happened ... ... and i'll do my best to get you tried as a juvenile .
you have to believe me .
when i went over there , i had no idea .
i never thought i'd ....
oh , god .
are you gonna do it or what?
i can't .
fuck !
so , what , i have to do it?
you don't do anything .
you just have ideas .
and you're so full of shit too .
crime is not an idea , it's an act .
anybody can think it .
only free men can do it .
i'm free .
give me the gloves .
give them to me .
thank you .
i had to show him .
i could have let you die up there , but i didn't .
thank you .
wait !
i just want a chance .
i wanna start over .
i wanna
it doesn't work that way .
you get one life .
and whatever you do with it , whatever's done to you ... ... you gotta face that .
you can't pretend it didn't happen .
jessica marie hudson?
jessica marie hudson .
for the carl hudson parole hearing?
jessica marie hudson?
that's me .
