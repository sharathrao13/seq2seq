greetings , my friend .
you are interested in the unknown ... the mysterious , the unexplainable .
that is why you are here .
and now , for the first time ... we are bringing you the full story ofwhat happened .
we are giving you all the evidence ... based only on the secret testimony of the miserable souls ... who survived this terrifying ordeal .
the incidents , places
my friend , we cannot keep this a secret any longer .
can your heart stand the shocking facts ... of the true story ... of edward d. wood , jr .? .
1 5 .
we can't hold the curtain any longer .
cripes , what am i gonna tell the cast? .
it's press night and there's no press !
do you believe in ghosts? .
nah , tommy .
that's just kiddie spook stories .
onceyou're dead , you stay dead .
i don't kknow , bill .
out on that battlefield today , i saw this woman dressed in white ... floating above the dunes .
maybe it was just fatigue or maybe it's the indignities ofwar .
ormaybe it's somethin'else .
hey , i think i see somethin '.
i offeryou mortals the bird of peace ... so that you may change your ways ... and end this destruction .
what a show !
evetyone was terrifiic .
paul , your second act monologue actually gave me the chills .
oh , thanks , eddie .
i got the early edition , hot off the presses !
this is the big moment .
oh , what does that old queen know? .
she didn't even show .
sent her copy boy to do the dirty work .
sc rew you , miss crowley .
do i really have a face like a horse? .
what does " ostentatious " mean? .
hey , it's not that bad .
you can't concentrate on the negative .
look , he's got some nice things to say here .
the soldiers 'costumes are very realistic . " that's positive !
rave of the century .
well , i've seen a lot worse reviews .
i've seen reviews where they didn't even mention the costumes .
like that last francis the mule picture .
it got terrible notices .
huge hit !
lines around the block .
that's right .
don't take it too seriously .
we're all doing great work .
do you really think so? .
absolutely .
honey , what if i'm wrong? .
what if i just don't got it? .
ed , it was only one review .
orson welles was only 26 when he made citizen kane .
i'm already 30 .
ed , you're still young .
this is the time in your life when you're supposed to be struggling .
i know .
but i'm scared it's not going to get any better than this .
oh , i hate having to wake up this early .
gosh , where's my pink sweater? .
i can never seem to find my clothes any more .
hey , big shot !
get offyour ass and get this over to the executive building .
sure thing , mr kravitz .
hey , charlie , come here .
what did i tell ya about watering these plants , eh? .
i want some water on 'em !
don't sprinkle the damn things !
soak 'em !
hi .
all right , people , settle .
and ... action !
wow !
look at these camels !
these are real camels !
gosh , where'd they get real camels? .
hey , you !
move it outta here , huh? .
hey , eddie !
come in here .
i got some great new stuff to show you .
this is fantastic .
what are you gonna do with it? .
probably file it away and never see it again .
ah , it's such a waste .
why , if i had half the chance , i could make an entire movie using this stock footage .
the story opens on these mysterious explosions .
nobody knows what's causing them , but it's upsetting all the buffalo .
so the military are called in to solve the mystery .
you forgot the octopus .
no , no .
i'm saving that for my big underwater climax .
hello .
they say he was a girl trapped in a man's body .
i bet it hurt when they cut his thing off .
ugh !
what are you ladies gabbin 'about? .
you know that christine jorgensen freak? .
he she it's in variety .
some producer's makin 'a biopic .
really? .
i didn't read that story .
yes , i've got mr edward wood on the line .
could you please hold? .
mr weiss? .
ed wood here .
listen , i heard about your new project and i was curious ifyou'd signed a directoryet .
oh , you haven't !
well , ifwe could get together , i could explain to you ... why i'm more qualified to direct this than anyone else in town .
well , i'd rather not go into that over the phone .
all right .
great !
i'll see you then .
bye !
eddie , i don't understand .
why are you the most qualified director for the christine jorgensen story? .
oh , it's just hogwash , hon .
i had to get into the door somehow .
no , i loveyou likke a brother .
no , no , no .
no , no , no .
that's a fialsehood !
come in !
look , when i said you could have the western territories , i didn't mean all 1 1 states !
i meant california , oregon , and what's that one on top? .
washington , yeah , yeah !
w oh , really? .
well , screw you !
hi .
can i help you? .
yes .
i'm ed wood .
i'm here about directing the christine jorgensen picture .
well , a couple of things have changed .
it ain't gonna be the christine jorgensen story no more .
goddam variety had to print the story before i got the rights .
now that bitch is asking for the sky .
ah , you're not gonna make the movie .
no , of course i'm gonna make the picture .
i already presold alabama and oklahoma .
those repressed okies , they go for that twisted , perverted stuff .
we'll just do it without the she male .
we'll fictionalize it .
is there a script? .
fuck no .
but , there's a poster .
it opens in nine weeks in tulsa .
well , mr weiss , look no further .
i'm your man .
i work fast and i'm a deal .
i write and direct .
and i'm good .
i just did a play in hollywood and victor crowley himself praised its realism .
there's about 500 guys in this town that can say the same thing .
on the phone you said you had some special qualifications? .
mr weiss ...
i have never told anyone ... what i'm about to tell you .
but i really want this job .
i like to dress in women's clothing .
you're a fruit? .
no , not at all .
i love women .
wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them .
you're not a fruit .
no , i'm all man .
i even fought in w. w ..
two .
of course , i was wearing women's undergarments under my uniform .
ya got to be kidding me .
confidentially , i even paratrooped wearing a brassiere and panties .
i tell ya , i wasn't scared of being killed , but i was terrified of getting wounded ... and having the medics discover my secret .
so you think this qualifies you to make my movie? .
yes !
i know what it's like to live with a secret ... and worry about what people are gonna think ofya .
my girlfriend still doesn't know why her sweaters are always stretched out .
ed , you seem like a nice kid .
look around you .
i don't hire directors with burning desires to tell their stories .
i make movies like chained girls .
i need someone with experience who can shoot a film in four days and make me a profit .
i'm sorty .
that's all that matters .
can i get you anything else , kid? .
too constrictive !
i can't even fold my arms .
gee , mr lugosi , i've never had any complaints .
this is the most uncomfortable coffin i've ever been in .
your selection is quite shoddy .
you're wasting my time !
mr lugosi? .
i told you i don't want any ofyour goddam coffins !
no , no !
i don't work here .
then who are you? .
what do you want? .
i don't want anything .
i'm just a really big , big fan .
i've seen all your movies .
mr lugosi , why are you buying a coffin? .
i'm planning on dying soon .
no !
yes !
i'm embarking on another bus and truck tour of dracula .
twelve cities in ten days , if that's conceivable .
do you know that i saw you perform dracula in poughkeepsie in 1 938? .
that was a terrible production .
renfield was a drunk !
i thought it was great .
you know , you're much scarier in real life than you are in the movie .
thankyou .
i even waited outside to get your autograph , but you never came out .
well , i apologize .
when i play dracula , i put myself into a trance .
it takes me much time to reemerge .
oh , there's my bus .
shit , where is my transfer? .
say , don't you have a car? .
i refuse to drive in this country .
too many madmen .
i've got a car .
boy , mr lugosi , you must lead such an exciting life .
when is your next picture coming out? .
i have no next picture .
you gotta be jokin '.
a great star like you , you must have dozens of'em lined up .
back in the old days , yes .
but now , no one gives two fucks for bela .
but you're a big star .
no more .
i haven't worked in four years .
this business , this town , it chews you up , then spits you out .
i'm just an ex bogeyman .
make a right .
they don't want the classic horror films any more .
today , it's all giant bugs .
giant spiders , giant grasshoppers .
who would believe such nonsense? .
the old ones were much spookier ; they had castles and full moons .
they were mythic .
they had a poetry to them .
yes .
and you know what else? .
the women
the women prefer the traditional monsters .
the women .
huh .
the pure horror , it both repels and attracts them .
because in their collective unconsciousness ... they have the agony of childbirth .
the blood the blood is horror .
you know , i never thought of that .
take my word for it .
ifyou want to make out with a young lady ... you take her to see dracula .
eh , what a mess .
my wife of 20 years left me last month .
i'm not much of a housekeeper .
all right , i'm coming .
i'll feed you , my darlings .
i'd better get going .
but perhaps we could get together again some time , mr lugosi .
certainly .
but now , the children of the night are calling me .
uh [ nervous chuckle ]
good day .
good day .
sweetie , you won't believe it .
i've got incredible news .
you got the job !
no , i didn't get the job .
but something better happened .
better than not getting the job .
yes !
i met a movie star .
somebody really big .
who? .
robert taylor? .
no .
a horror movie star .
boris karloff? .
close .
the other one .
you met ...
basil rathbone !
oh , to heck with you .
i met bela lugosi .
why , i thought he was dead .
no , he's very much alive .
well ... sort of .
he's old and frail , but he's still bela lugosi and he's really nice .
i can't even remember the last time i saw him in a picture .
it's a shame .
he's such a great actor and no one uses him any more .
so , did you get his autograph? .
no , it wasn't like that at all .
it was just the two of us and we were talking .
he treated me like a friend .
yeah , well , he's a bum .
no , he's not .
do you have any idea how much money he made for this studio? .
dracula , the blackk cat , the raven .
yeah? .
well , now he's a junkie .
he don't deserve to work .
that is not true !
he's so great , you hire him .
yeah , well , i would if i could .
trickk ortreat !
the house lookks likke they have lots ofikkids .
ooh , those eyes .
he gives me the willies .
uh , i hate it when she interrupts the picture .
she doesn't show 'em the proper respect .
i think she's a honey .
look at those jugs .
but he stood me up at the restaurant .
i guess i shouldn't have picked a steakk house .
and then i went out with the wolfiman .
ugh !
what an evening .
i didn't kknow whether to kkiss him good night  vampira ... you will come under my spell .
you will be my slave of love .
my gosh , bela !
how do you do that? .
you must be double jointed .
and you must be hungarian .
vampira , look at me .
look into my eyes .
you're watching our halloween movie , white zombie ... starring bela lugosi , john harron , madge bellamy ... and a bunch of other people i've never heard of .
i'm very tired .
i need to take my medicine .
do you want me to get it foryou? .
no .
thankyou , eddie .
i'll be all right .
oh , shit .
i feel much better !
children !
i love children !
trick or treat !
aren't you scared , little boy? .
i'm going to drink your blood .
you're not a real vampire .
those teeth don't firighten me .
how about these? .
hey , how'd you do that? .
dentures .
lost my pearlies in the war .
so , what was the important newsyou couldn't tell me on the phone , again?
i started thinking about what you were saying about how your movies need to make a profit .
what is the one thing , ifyou put it in a movie , it'll be successful? .
tits .
no , better than that .
a star .
kid , you must have me confused with david selznick .
i don't make major motion pictures ; i make crap .
yes !
but ifyou take that crap and put a star in it , then you've got something .
yeah .
crap with a star .
no , something better !
something impressive .
maybe the biggest money maker you've ever had .
fine , all right .
you may be right , but it doesn't frickin 'matter .
i can't afford a star , so what are we even talkin 'about? .
all right .
what if i told you you could have a star for $1, 000? .
who? .
lugosi?
yes !
lugosi !
isn't he dead? .
no , he's not dead .
he lives in baldwin hills .
i met him recently and he really wants to be in our movie .
why would lugosi want to do a sex change flick? .
because he's my friend !
all right , fine !
you can direct it .
i want a script in three days .
we start shooting a weekk firom monday .
mr weiss , thank you so much .
you won't regret it .
i won't let you down .
but bunny , you're perfect for this job .
you know these people .
i need all the transsexuals and transvestites i can get .
no , i don't care if they're not actors .
i want realism !
i want this film to tell the truth .
coming !
i've waited all my life for this shot , and i'm not gonna blow it .
eddie , you got a new movie for me , eh? .
yes !
it's gonna be a great picture and you'll love your character .
have a seat .
listen , bunny? .
bela's here .
i gotta go .
listen , hit the bars , work some parties , and get me transvestites !
i need transvestites !
all right .
bye .
eddie , what kind of a movie is this? .
well , it's about how people have two personalities : the side they show to the world , and then the secret person they hide inside .
like jekyil and hyde .
i've always wanted to play jekyil and hyde .
i'm looking forward to this production .
well , your part's a little different .
you're like the god that looks over all the characters and oversees everything .
i don't understand .
you control everyone's fate .
you're like the puppetmaster .
ah , so i pull the strings !
yes , you pull the strings .
pull the strings .
i like that !
honey !
i got a little surprise foryou .
wipe offyour hands .
i finished my script .
oh !
ed , i'm so proud ofyou !
i'll read it as soon as i get home .
well , i'd really like to know what you think .
why don't you go in the bedroom and take a look? .
i'll wait .
go ahead .
take your time .
so that's where my sweater's been .
how long have you been doing this? .
since i was a kid .
my mom wanted a girl , so she used to dress me in girlie clothing .
just became a habit .
jesus christ !
and you never told me? .
well , this is my way of telling you .
what , by putting it in a fucking script for everyone to see? .
what kind of sick mind operates like that? .
and what about this , this so called barbara character ... that's obviously me? .
i mean , this is our life .
it's so embarrassing !
of course it is .
that's why you should play the part .
oh , you got nerve , buddy .
it's a darn good role .
that's not the issue !
god , how can you act so casual when you're dressed like that? .
it makes me feel comfortable .
oh , just like in the script .
exactly .
so , what do you say? .
do we break up? .
or do you want to make the movie with me? .
they make you tall , and you're flashy .
they want that .
okay .
but they want professionalism , so nix on the nelly ... without losing naivete , okay? .
now , the good news isyou're probably going to get hired becauseyou lookk likke peggy lee .
but i don't want anybody else to resent that , okay? .
please? .
'cause there's enough for everybody , exotics too .
all right , because ifyou're not going to smile , please don't bother .
you'll embarrass me .
this is george weiss .
he's done some very important things ; he's a nice person to know .
an important person to know .
i thought you were gonna make a sex change film !
it's still a sex change film .
yeah !
five pages before it ends !
the rest is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters !
i don't think he's a schmuck .
what about this title? .
my poster says , i changed my sex ..
so change the poster .
trust me , you'll be better off .
this story's gonna grab people .
it's about this guy , he's crazy about this girl , but he likes to wear dresses .
should he tell her? .
should he not tell her? .
he's torn .
this is drama !
fine !
shoot whatever baloney you want .
just make sure it's seven reels long .
testing .
ex . cuse me .
can i get evetyone's attention , please?
couldyou gather around?
i've got something to say .
everybody , we're about to embark on quite a journey : four days of hard work .
but when it's over , we'll have a picture that'll entertain , enlighten ... and maybe even move millions ofipeople .
excuse me , eddie .
i don't mean to interrupt .
i'm worried about the light .

mr lugosi , it is an unparalleled privilege to meet you , sir .
allow me to introduce myself .
i am criswell .
it's a pleasure .
ahh , cheer up .
don't lose heart over what happened tonight .
i predict ... your next project will be an outstanding success !

i guessed .
really? .
i made it up .
it's horse shit .
eddie , there's no such thing as a psychic .
people believe my folderol because i wear a black tuxedo .
it's that easy? .
eddie , we're in show biz .
it's all about razzle dazzle , appearances .
ifyou look good and you talk well , people will swallow anything .
we are going to have the most terrifying monster ever seen on film .
a ghastly creature created from an atomic mutation !
i don't like scary movies .
i like the ones with love stories .
that's just what this movie is : a heartbreaking romance .
you're quite a specimen .
and you're going to be in the picture? .
yeah .
i play lobo .
i predict bride ofitheatom will be the biggest moneymaker of all time .
and this is lovely starlet dolores fuller , who will playjanet lawton .
my pleasure , ma'am .
now , how much will this picture cost? .
well , in a normal studio it'd be about a million bucks ... with all their wasteful overhead and fancy offices .
but we're more efficient , so we could bring it in at about 70 grand .
oh .
well , i shall certainly consider it .
well , goodbye .
good night , ed .
keep in touch .
goodbye .
well , eddie , how'd we do? .
we didn't make a nickel .
i cannot believe i'm in hollywood .
you kknow , daddy didn't want me to move out here .
uh huh .
ma'am , your bill comes to $2 . 20 .
oh .
uh , okkay .

pleased to make your acquaintance .
i'm loretta king .
edward d. wood, jr .
hi .

i'm terribly allergic to them .
you know , i work in hollywood .
i'm a producer .
really? .
wow !
i would love to be involved in that .
is that right? .
well , maybe i can help you out .
have you ever thought about investing in a motion picture? .
perhaps a small amount of money .
how much do your motion pictures cost? .
well , my new one , i think , would be about $60, 000 .
that's all? .
that seems very reasonable for an entire picture .
would you would you like to , uh ...
have a look at the at the photoplay? .
oh , sure .
oh , my .
this is very interesting .
say , do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts? .
oh , you want to be an actress too .
well , of course .
there's a couple of parts i can think of right now that you might be perfect for .
there's , uh , the secretary in the newspaper office , the file clerk , um
hmm .
those sound kind of small .
here's one that looks good janet lawton .
i'd sure likke to play her .
janet lawton .
yes .
janet lawton is clearly the part to play .
can't you just see me in the part? .
yes !
you'd be perfect .
you bastard !
you two timing , dress wearing son of a bitch !
honey , it was the only way i could get the movie made !
who do you think's been paying the rent? .
who's been helping you type your scripts and do all your grunt work? .
i am sorry !
what did you want me to say? .
you were supposed to say ...
no .
i wrote that part for my girlfriend dolores !
snowball , there are plenty of other parts .
like what? .
the secretary , the file clerk .
aaaaah !
you ... asshole !
this is gonna be bela's laboratory , so it should be real impressive ... just like one of those " mad scientist " movies .
i want test tubes , beakers and one of those electrical things that buzzes .
you mean a tesla coil? .
fine .
whatever .
hop to it !
right !
right .
eddie? .
yes?
which dress do you like better? .
hmm .
i don't know .
say , bill , which dress works better foryou , the red one or the green one? .
which one is the red one? .
what do you mean? .
i mean , i can't see the difference ; i'm colour blind .
but i kinda like the dark grey one .
at universal , we used to shoot one ortwo scenes a day .
but eddie can knock off twenty , thirty .
he's incredible !
and ... action !

looks like big baldy had a little trouble gettin 'through the door .

all right , people , let's get ready .
actors !
i must have my actors !
there you are .
loretta , tor , i wanna explain this scene ; it's a little complicated , but
bela , you'll be sitting there .
okay? .
i'm not getting near that goddam thing .
one of them burned me on the return ofichandu .
all right .
then you'll be sitting there .
good .
great .
all right , gang , here's the scene .
loretta , you're in a trance ; you glide in and get on the operating table .
now , tor , you're supposed to tie her down , but you have an angora fetish ... and when you rub that swatch of angora , it makes you refuse .
so then bela has to discipline you .
all right? .
great !
let's do it !
action !
strap her to the table .
do as i command you !
i'll teach you to disobey me !
aaaargh !
you will obey !

i am terribly sorry to bother you while you're shooting ... but the guy that owns the stage needs his money .
well , then , you should pay him , shouldn't you? .
yes .
exactly .
i kind of need it now .
w what are you looking at me like that for? .
i already gave you my three hundred .
right .
and now i need the other sixty thousand .
what other sixty thousand? .
the other sixty thousand you said you'd give to me .
you misunderstood , eddie .
i gave you everything i have in the world three hundred dollars .
well , here we go again .
let me tell ya , ya can't lose .
it's scary .
and ifyou don't like that , it's romantic .
bela lugosi will portray dr eric vornoff .
and lovely , lovely , lovely ingenue loretta king ... is reporter janet lawton .
i don't know .
lugosi looks pretty old .
huh? .
which role does vampira play?
vampira? .
why do you ask? .
she's standing right over there .
well , she plays
excuse me one minute .
pardon me .
miss vampira? .
yes? .
you don't know me , but i'm ed wood .
i'm a film producer and i'm currently in production on a science fiction piece ... with bela lugosi and swedish wrestler tor johnson .
i don't understand .
do you want my autograph? .
no .
no , i i think my film is perfect foryou .
want me to show it on my tv programme .
i have nothing to do with that .
you should call the station manager at channel 7 .
no , no .
no , no , no , no .
i don't want you to show the movie , i want you to be in it .
let me explain .
we started shooting , but after three days we got shut down .
now we're having a backers party to raise some more money .
so i thought perhaps you'd like to come over just to say " howdy " to some of the backers .
look , i'm with some friends and we're about to eat .
please !
it would just take one second .
come over and meet the backkers .
there is a really nice dentist firom ox . nard .
look , buddy , i've got real offers from real studios .
i don't need to blow some dentist for a part .
forget it .
miss vampira !
please .
ohh !
let's go .
i'm getting a bad feeling about this .
let's get out of here .
yeah , i thinkk you're right .
thankyou , folks , for comin 'tonight , but we better go .
and then dr vornoff falls into the pit ... and his own octopus attacks and eats him .
the end .
whew !
well , that's quite a story .
yes .
so , uh , you made the movie ... and now you wanna make it again? .
no .
we shot ten minutes of the movie , and now we're looking for completion funds .
oh , son , you're too vague .
billy bob !
you're cuttin ''em too lean .
mr mccoy .
how can i make you happy? .
okkay .
two things .
i want the movie to end with a big explosion .
sky full of smoke .
yes .
but it ends with dr vornoff falling into the pit .
not any more .
i got a son .
he's a little slow , but a good boy .
and somethin 'tells me he'd make a helluva leadin 'man .
sounds perfect .
this is unbelievable .

my dear professor strowski ... twenty years ago i was banned from my homeland .

the authorities have learned how correct your findings were .
so i am here ... to bringyou home .

that's incredible ; that's the first picture i ever saw .
that is incredible .
you know , i had to sleep with the lights on for a week .
i had to for a month .
but i never missed a lugosi picture after that one .
a few years ago i actually saw him do dracula live .
it was much scarier in person .

isn't he? .
no , they say his eligibility ran out years ago .
look , doctor ... he doesn't have any money .
but i'll give you everything i've got ; a few hundred dollars .
that won't even begin to cover it .
he's gonna have to leave .

we're gonna do the main footage later .
all right? .
so , what's this scene about? .
um ...
you're a very important and respected man .
and you're leaving your house ; you're in a hurry .
you're on your way to a big social brouhaha .
okay? .
eddie .
what if i'm not in so big a hurry? .
what if i take a moment to slow down ; to savour the beauty of life ; to , to smell a budding flower? .
that's great .
that is great .
let's do a take .
okay? .
ed , i'm really busy .
what do you want now? .
i was calling to see ifyou'd like to attend ... the world premiere of my new movie , bride ofithe monster .
didn't you just make one called bride ofithe atom?
yes , it's the same film .
but the distributor wanted a punchier title .
come on , it's gonna be a big event ; bela , tor and cris are coming .
you'll have fun !
uhh !
i can't see .
these contact lenses are hurting .
my eyes are killin 'me .
don't worry .
we're almost there .
hi .
right in there .
thank god you're here .
they're tearing up the place .
come on , come on .
come on , this way .
come on !
come on !
i've never been to a movie premiere before !
well , go knock 'em dead .
oooh !
at the stroke of midnight ... the witching hour ... the ghouls arise ...
firom the dead !
hey , vampira , how 'bout a little love !
fuck off !
one of them stole my wallet !
i can't see !
get off me !
let's go !
i gotta save 'em !
get your heads down !
come on , let's go !
we're getting the heck outta here !
can't see !
i can't see any more !
hey , come on !
let's split !
taxi !
stop !
get in !
come on !
go on , get in !
now , that was a premiere .
eddie ...
last night was quite a romp .
did you see that kid grab vampira's boobies? .
i envied him .
hell , i envied you too .
a girlfriend who would jump in front of a car like that .
yes , she is quite something .
none of my wives would have .
eddie , i want to thankyou .
these last few days have been ... a good time .
you know , i just
i just wish you coulda seen the movie .
ahh .
no problem .
i know it by heart .
home .
i have no home .
hunted .
despised .
living like an animal .
the jungle is my home .
but i shall show the world ... that i can be its master !
i shall perfect my own race of people ... a race of atomic supermen ... that will conquer the world !
uh , mr lugosi , could i have your autograph , please? .
certainly .
why , that was that was incredible .
i mean , you're just as great as you ever were .
better .
i am 74 , but i don't know it .
when the brain is young ... the spirit is still ... vigorous ...
iike like a young man .
and left the planet mars ... never to return again .
the end .
mmm .
wood productions .
hey , who's crazy idea was it to bury him in the cape? .
i heard it was in the will ; it was how he wanted to be remembered .
could you run it again? .
mr wood .
huh?
uh , mr wood , this is mr reynolds , your landlord .
could you please open up? .
one minute .
yes? .
uh , mr wood , you have bounced your third and final rent cheque .
i'm terribly sorry .
my my stockbroker must've transferred the wrong account .
come on in .
i'll write you another cheque .
ahh .
i see you're in the picture business .
yes .
i'm interested in the picture business .
my associates and i , we wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films ... about the apostles .
but unfortunately , we don't have enough money .
well , raising money's tough .
no , our church has enough money for one film .
we just don't have enough for all twelve .
well , you know what you do? .
you produce a film in a commercially proven genre ... and then after it's a hit , you take the profits from that and make the 1 2 apostles movies .
would that work? .
absolutely .
let me show you something .
you see this script? .
grave robbers from outerspace .
money in the bank .
grave robbers from what? .
from outer space .
it's science fiction .
very big with the kids .
ifyou make this picture , you'll have enough money to finance a hundred religious films ... and pay my back rent with the profits .
i don't know .
this is , um , all a lot to absorb .
it's a guaranteed blockbuster .
mmm .
i understand this science fiction is very popular , but , um ... don't the big hits always have big stars? .
well , we have a big star bela lugosi .
bela lugosi
oh , i thought he passed on .
yes .
yes , he did .
but ...
i've got the last footage he ever shot .
doesn't look like very much .
mr reynolds , this is the acorn that will grow a great oak .
i'll just get a double to finish his scenes ... and we'll release it as bela lugosi's final film .
bunny? .
we're makin 'another movie .
yes , i got the baptist church of beverly hills to put up the cash .
ed , i got the lugosi doubles outside .
bunny , i gotta go .
he's too short .
he's too tall .
he's just not going to work .
well , ed , i was thinkin 'like when bela played fu manchu .
paul , that was karloff .
oh .
you're gonna have to try harder .
okay .
try to be a cut above .
go get 'em .
okay .
right .
keep sunday open ; the producers want us to get baptised .
okay .
you know , hon , when you rewrite a script , it just gets better and better .
this is the ultimate ed wood movie .
no compromises .
oh , my .
eddie , lookk at this .
hmm?
what? .
poor girl's out of a job .
i brought the script .
you'll be portraying the ghoul's wife .
the ghoul's wife? .
yes .
you should feel lucky .
eddie's the only fella in town who doesn't pass judgement on people .
that's right .
if i did , i wouldn't have any friends .
look , would it be possible to make the ghoul's wife a little less prominent ...
so people wouldn't really notice me in the movie? .
you don't want to be noticed? .
yeah .
how about this? .
what if i don't have any lines? .
i'll play the part mute .
mute? .
hey , it's dr tom .
dr tom !
hiya !
who's dr tom? .
he's my chiropractor .
hey , kathy .
how are you? .
fine , thanks .
well , look at you .
you're looking in alignment today .
well , actually , my neck is a little funny .
now , here , let me fix that .
ooh !
my gosh !
don't move .
it's uncanny .
look at his head !
it's uncanny !
lift up your voice
and let us sing
alleluia , alleluia
he look nothin 'like bela .
he's kinda got his ears .
oh , look .
coveryour face with this .
oh .
now i can see it .
i want to suck your blood .
i want to suck your blood !
let's hearyou call boris karloff a cocksucker .
shh !
we want these baptists to like us .
please .
alleluia
brothers and sisters ... we reach now in the service a joyous point ... because we are going to bear witness to the baptism of our new members .
why couldn't we do this in the church? .
because brother tor couldn't fit in the sacred tub .
welcome to the fold , brother .
do you accept jesus christ as your personal saviour? .
yes !
in the name of the father , the son and the holy ghost .
amen .
welcome to the fold , brother .
welcome .
praise the lord , brother .
do you reject satan and all his evils? .
sure .
in the name of the father , the son and the holy ghost .
praise the lord , firiends !
do you repent fior allyour sins?
i do .
how do you do it? .
how do you get all your friends to get baptised ...
just so you can make a monster movie? .
it's not a monster movie .
it's a supernatural thriller .
come tojesus , brother !
i can't believe this .
ed , what am i gonna do here? .
what do you mean? .
he has no hair .
gee , i never noticed that .
put a wig on him !
before we start shooting , mr wood , we have a few questions .
yes .
the script contains numerous references to grave robbing .
now , we find the concept of digging up consecrated ground to be highly offensive .
it is blasphemy .
what are you talking about? .
it's the premise of the movie .
it's the title of the movie , for christ's sakes !
mr wood !
yes , about that title .
it strikes us as very inflammatory .
why don't we change it to plan 9 from outerspace?
ha !
that's ridiculous .
all right .
and , action !
medical examiner been around yet? .
just left .
the morgue wagon oughta be along most any time .
you get their statement? .
yeah , but they're pretty scared .
fine mess like this will frighten anyone .
you have one ofithe boys , uh ... takke the guy and the girl backk to town ; you takke charge .
what'd you give him all the lines for? .
he's unintelligible .
lugosi's dead and vampira won't talk ; i had to give somebody the dialogue !
that is no answer !
what about glitter? .
when i was a headliner in paris , audiences always liked it when i sparkled .
no !
cat's eyes !
no !
well , i'm going to need some antennae .
no !
you're the ruler of the galaxy !
show a little taste !
see?
no talking .
isn't he good?
cue dr tom .
n now?
yes , now .
lurk him .
be sure and keep your face covered .
isn't it wonderful? .
bela lives .
doesn't it strike you as a bit morbid? .
no .
he would've loved it .
bela's returned from the grave .
just like dracula .
cue vampira .
cut !
let's go down and fiind out whose grave it is .
oh , why do i always get hooked up with these spook details? .
monsters , graves , bodies !
cue flying saucer .
and cut !
print .
we're moving on .
that was perfect .
perfect? .
mr wood ... do you know anything about the art of film production? .
well , i like to think so .
that cardboard headstone tipped over .
this graveyard is obviously phoney .
nobody will ever notice that .
filmmaking is not about the tiny details .
it's about the big picture .
the big picture?
yes .
how about when the policemen arrived in daylight , but now it's suddenly night? .
what do you know? .
haven't you heard of suspension of disbelief? .
reverend , i'm here .
oh .
who is he? .
this is our choir director .
he's gonna play the young hero .
are you people insane? .
i'm the director !
i make the casting decisions around here !
i thought this was a group effort .
no !
no? .
they're driving me crazy !
these baptists are ... stupid , stupid , stupid !
okay .
i gotta calm down .
gotta calm down .
gotta calm down .
take a deep breath .
relax .
all right , everybody .
let's get set up for scene 1 1 2 .
move the crypt stage left , and let's get tor's make up effect ready .
mr wood !
what do you think you're doing? .
i'm directing .
not like that you're not !
remove that get up immediately !
you shame our lord .
that's it !
i can't take it !
take me to the nearest bar , and make it snappy !
imperial whisky .
oh , my gosh .
orson welles .
excuse me , sir? .
yes? .
um well , i'm a young filmmaker and a real big fan .
i i just wanted to meet you .
my pleasure .
i'm orson welles .
i'm , uh , edward d. wood, jr .
what you working on? .
well , the financing just fell through for the third time on don quix . ote .
you know , i can't believe it .
that sounds just exactly like my problems .
it's the damn money men .
they never know who's a windbag and who's got the goods .
then they all think they're directors .
ain't that the truth? .
do you know that i've even had producers re cut my movies? .
i hate when that happens .
and they're always ttying to cast their buddies .
it doesn't even matter if they're right for the part .
tell me about it .
i'm supposed to do a thriller at universal ... but they want charlton heston to play a mexican .
ah , mr welles .
is it all worth it? .
it is when it works .
you know , the one film of mine where i had total control , kane? .
the studio hated it ... but they didn't get to touch a firame .
ed .
yes? .
visions are worth fiighting fior .
why spendyour lifie making someone else's dreams?
thank you ...
orson .
mr reynolds .
yes .
we are gonna finish this picture just the way i want it ... because you cannot compromise an artist's vision .
but it's our money .
and you're gonna make a bundle ... but only ifyou shut up and let me do things my way .
all right , gang .
actors in positions .
let's finish this picture .
action .
wanna give him a hand? .
keep rolling .
now that's an alien .
action .
what plan will you follow now? .
plan 9 .
plan 9? .
ah , yes .
plan 9 deals with the resurrection of the dead .
long distance electrodes shot into the pineal and pituitary glands ... of the recent dead .
you know , maybe you guys were right .
plan 9 " is a good title .
i want that lightning , i want those two explosions ...
and i've got to have more shots of the military !
right .
and cut .
all right , friends .
prepare for scene 32 .
m mr. wood? .
yeah? .
where's the cockpit set? .
you're standing in it .
places !
but what ifwe develop this solenite bomb? .
then we'd be a stronger nation too .
stronger .
you see? .
you see? .
your stupid minds .
stupid .
stupid !
that's all i'm gonna take outta you !
oh !
cut !
action .
greetings , my friend .
we are all interested in the future ... for that is where you and i are going to spend the rest of our lives .
future events such as these will effect you in the future .
and ... cut !
that's a wrap .
oh !
i can't get it up .
it's stuck .
eddie , you're gonna be late for your own premiere .
all right , forget it .
ladies and gentlemen .
you are about to see an extraordinary motion picture .
but befiore it begins , i thinkk we should all give a hand to the man ... without whom we wouldn't be here tonight .
eddie , take a bow !
thank you .
i just wanna say that this film ... is for bela .
the griefiofihis wifie's death ... became greater and greater agony .
the home they had so long shared together ... became a tomb a sweet memoty ofiherjoyous living .
the skky to which he had once lookked ... was now only a covering fior her dead body .
the ever beautifiul filowers she had planted ... with her own hands ... became nothing more than the lost roses ofiher cheekks .
confiused by his great loss ... the old man left that home ... never to return again .
this is the one .
this is the one i'll be remembered for .
aw , gee , honey , i'm so happy for ya !
say , let's get married .
huh? .
right now .
let's go to vegas .
but , eddie , it's pouring , and the car top is stuck .
phooey !
it's only a five hour drive ... and it'll probably stop by the time we get to the desert .
heck , it'll probably stop by the time we get around the corner .
let's go .
oh !
