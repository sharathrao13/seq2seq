hello , angus .
is that really you , bobby jones?
where is everybody?
my lord .
how have you been?
fine , bobby .
just fine .
we're on our way to the olympics in berlin ... and i couldn't be this close to the old course ....
good lord .
i only told one person there was a reservation for an r. jones .
angus , my game is ....
your game is always fine here .
welcome back , bobby .
great to see you , bobby .
smile for the front page .
you were terrific .
thank you , bobby .
watch this one , boy .
shit fire !
you looking for this?
i'm sorry , camilla , i hooked it .
you best take care ... you don't hook none of these windows in this house , young man ... or your daddy will tan your hide .
how is your tummy today?
it's okay .
think you can eat some lunch for me?
i got some leftover chicken and biscuits .
i was gonna make a pie .
okay .
robert , are you all right?
yes , mama .
come on in .
i want to see how much you weigh .
look at you .
you've gained another pound .
can i play baseball with frank and perry now?
soon .
poppo !
hey !
there he is .
i have something in my pocket .
and i wonder what it could be?
you got it .
come here .
let's go see your mama .
why did you tell camilla this is monkey year?
not monkey year , honey .
i said it was the year of the monkey .
in the chinese zodiac ... each of the 12 years is named for a different animal .
so each animal contributes its own characteristics to that year .
so if you are born in that year , you take on those traits .
like a monkey or a horse or an ox .
what animal am l?
you , my dearest , are a tiger .
tigers are born leaders .
they are loners .
they have a short temper ... but they go after their ambitions no matter how hard the opposition .
what animal are you , mama?
i'm a dragon .
can you breathe fire?
yes , i can .
especially if i find out ... you've been playing with frank meador while he's still coughing .
you are my little man .
i don't want anything bad to happen to you .
don't worry , mama .
i'm a tiger .
good night .
good night , dear .
you're a frightful long ways from carnoustie .
and my ass is painful to prove it .
it's a beautiful course .
and some nice people , too .
free with their money .
can any of them play?
not really .
if they could , they wouldn't need you , would they?
they make their whiskey out of corn here .
you're joking .
no , i'm not .
we're gonna miss you , jimmy .
it's great that your brother could take your place .
it's an honor to have him here .
so , stewart , what do you think about my stance?
go on .
you cannot keep it in the policies , you're craving for the byre .
come more down on the left hand .
shit fire !
show him , stewy .
baseball was my game .
i had a contract after i graduated from georgia ... with the brooklyn trolley dodgers .
but my father put the quietus on it .
threatened to disown me .
i went to law school instead .
good idea .
probably .
is that lad touched in the head?
wee bobby?
yeah .
no , he's just sickly .
he nearly died as a baby .
couldn't eat , he's allergic to everything .
they just bring him along for the exercise .
dirty rotten bastard !
oh , dear .
good afternoon , camilla .
are you here by yourself?
yes , mr. jones , they are all yonder playing golf .
ought to be back directly .
playing golf on the sabbath .
blasphemous .
won't you have a seat and wait?
let me get you a coca cola .
there's nothing in the bible about coca cola .
i will not permit it in my house .
just bring me a glass of cold water , please .
yes , sir .
coming right up .
golf .
big bob .
those cost 20 cents apiece .
great round , stewart .
terrific .
thank you .
well done .
tell me , mr. maiden , how did they decide ... that there should be 18 holes in a round of golf?
ma'am , a long time ago at st. andrew's ... they had a meeting to try and figure that out .
there's 18 shots in a bottle of whiskey ...
and i reckon when the bottle's empty , the round is done .
grandpa !
be careful .
hello , bobby .
son , you are growing like a weed .
you get bigger every time i see you .
papa , how nice of you to visit .
i had to come up on business .
meeting some buyers here from new york in the morning .
is this the way you spend your sabbath?
setting a bad example for your son?
getting little bob outdoors ... has done wonders for his health .
excuse me , papa , i have to go inside and change .
come along , robert .
go upstairs and dress for dinner .
you spend so much time playing golf out there , i can't help but wonder ... if it's for your son's health or your own amusement .
papa , i meet my biggest clients here .
the coca cola people are keeping me so busy i'm looking to take in a new partner .
and why?
because i play golf with asa kindler and bob woodruff .
so you're telling me that it's not your merit as a lawyer ... that's advancing your career?
how encouraging .
grandpa , look at my windmill .
i built it myself .
that's just fine , bobby .
maybe you'll grow up to be an engineer ... and not fritter away your time playing worthless ball games .
son of a bitch !
isn't that your house over there?
i bet your poor mother's missing you .
don't you think?
go on , now .
go home .
red , do you have to play golf?
what about me?
take two weeks off from the game .
and then give it up altogether .
what can i do for you , laddie?
what are those?
20 cents apiece .
did you get any of them while they were still rolling?
no , sir .
cheeky wee rascal , right enough .
good morning .
it is .
you know , i was thinking ... if wee bobby's gonna be tagging about ... he may as well play a bit , if he can keep up , that is .
i made him a few clubs .
wee bobby , hit the hell out of it .
bobby .
hey !
bobby , wake up .
come on , bobby , he started at six .
that's him , that's harry vardon .
five british opens .
did you see that?
aren't you children supposed to be in school?
it has been my impression if you shoot over 100 , you have no business playing .
if you shoot under 80 , you have no business .
rob , why don't you show us all how stewart maiden hits the ball?
go ahead , son .
yeah , pretty good?
now why don't you show us how judge broyles swings?
son of a bitch !
little bob .
you want to play with us?
we tee off in 10 minutes .
you go ahead , son .
be careful out there , now .
thanks .
you see , colonel?
thank you .
keep the change .
how you doing , milt?
o. b. how are you , sir?
who's your opponent?
oh , my .
he's just a boy .
it's embarrassing , o. b.
they mustn't let children play in adult tournaments .
now on the tee , mr. milt saul ... and mr. robert tyre jones , jr .
mr. jones , you have honors .
would you like to go first?
no , you go ahead , son .
good grief .
what a swing .
little bob jones , a tow headed boy from east lake golf club ... was born on st. patrick's day .
but luck is not an issue ... when you have a golf swing that can only be described as heavenly .
i'm going on record .
bobby jones is destined for greatness .
dixie whiz kid lights up georgia amateur .
by o. b. keeler .
sheer delicatessen .
the winner of the georgia state amateur championship ... is mr. bobby jones .
congratulations , bobby .
bob .
congratulations , bob .
gentlemen , from what i've seen today ...
i believe your boys are ready to play in the us amateur .
the us amateur?
play , colonel , i didn't say i expected them to win .
half a league , half a league half a league onward
forward , the light brigade
was there a man dismay'd
not tho 'the soldier knew some one had blunder'd
theirs not to reason why theirs but to do or die
he gets that from his mother .
what are you doing?
you gonna play in those?
i thought your dad bought you new shoes .
these are my lucky ones .
i have my four leaf clover , too .
we're gonna need some luck .
look who's in this field .
the current us open champ ... three former amateur champs , two ncaa champs ... and us .
i heard the greens were like billiard tables .
bent grass .
it's like putting on ice .
you try to just tap your ball in and it slides all the way across the green .
it's 18 holes , boys , just like home .
come on , now .
let's go get registered .
excuse me .
thank you .
why , of course .
now on the tee , former amateur champion ...
mr. eben byers .
remember what old bob fitzsimmons used to say?
the bigger they are , the harder they fall .
next up , georgia state champion ...
mr. robert tyre jones , jr .
shit !
damn !
son of a bitch !
damn it to hell !
bobby jones .
shit fire !
god !
son of a bitch !
what a kid .
face of an angel .
the temper of a timber wolf .
leave the damn thing .
would you like some gum , mr. byers?
congratulations .
that was quite a match , son .
mr. byers and i both played terribly .
he just ran out of clubs before i did .
come on , let's call your dad .
if he keeps playing like this , i'm telling you , he could win this thing .
i've never seen anyone putt like this .
that was quite a round you played this morning .
you have a beautiful swing .
thank you .
you like ice cream?
yes , sir .
they give you as much as you want .
have a good time this afternoon .
i will , sir .
this is really fun .
good morning .
bob , that gentleman you were just talking to ... that's grantland rice , the sportswriter .
he writes for american golfer .
he likes my swing .
hey , bobby , come on .
go get him .
you have quite a following .
i can't help it .
good luck to you .
good luck to you , sir .
and now on the tee ...
mr. robert tyre jones , jr .
next on the tee , mr. robert gardner .
all square at the tenth .
there came three holes in succession that broke the kid's heart .
but the georgia schoolboy swung along in his worn shoes and dusty pants ...
whistling an air from a recent musical comedy ...
as jaunty as if he had won his first national championship ...
instead of just having been beaten in the third round .
he was thinking about his ice cream .
how you doing?
fine , thank you , sir .
mr. keeler .
you can call me o. b.
what are you reading , son?
just some stuff they wrote about me .
they make it sound like i didn't mind losing .
i did mind .
i was mad as hell .
i know you were mad .
i was there , i saw it .
a will to win , that's very important .
why do they care about what i wear?
they even made fun of my shoes .
that's the price of fame , son .
i'm afraid you have to get used to it .
i don't think i want to be famous .
it's too late now .
rob , all these people , our club members , our friends ... they expect a great deal of you now .
everybody here will be watching every match you play .
but i lost .
ln the future , you'll win .
you've shown everyone just what you're capable of .
you must not let us or yourself down .
you understand?
robert , he's just a child .
yes , clara ... but he's our child .
son of a bitching bastard .
i can't believe you just did that .
you could have hurt someone .
i threw it over their heads .
it was a simple shot , i've done it a million times .
there are some emotions , alexa ... that cannot be endured with a golf club still in your hands .
you know , that man paid $1, 500 to caddy for you .
these people paid good money to see you play .
they paid to see all of us play  no , bob , they came to see you .
you're the star .
i'm not a star .
you're the us amateur champion .
i haven't done anything .
but you're gonna do something , and they know it .
everybody knows it .
as soon as you get out of your own way .
tough luck , sport .
this isn't our day , bob .
he'll never make it over that tree .
showoff .
i told you , you were a star .
i don't want to be a star .
tell them .
way to go , bobby !
here he comes .
sir walter has arrived .
i heard he's quite the raconteur .
and then some .
he's broken all 1 1 of the ten commandments .
mr. hagen?
they are waiting for you .
where is she?
i took her to her home of residence .
where was l?
right there where you are now sitting .
hagen , let's go already .
genius deserves patience , my friend .
i'm afraid i'm a trifle soft in the treasury .
in case you have not been hearing , so is most of this entire world .
you still owe me two 20s and one 10 from last week .
and you have not been paying rent on this motorcar .
this is a charity function .
if i don't make some side bets , we go broke .
good man .
morning , chick .
where you been , walter?
practicing a few shots?
no , but i've been having a few .
young mr. jones , i presume .
i'm walter hagen .
i know who you are .
how do you do?
better than most , son .
i assume i have the honors .
on the tee , us open champion , walter hagen .
he swings like a wounded duck .
just don't bet money with him .
they don't call him sir walter for nothing .
nice putt .
two threes in a row .
18 threes make 54 .
next hole .
shit fire and damnation !
mashie .
i think we're in trouble .
i asked my wife what she wanted for christmas .
she said a divorce .
i said i wasn't thinking of anything that expensive .
excuse me .
you have quite a game .
i played awful .
i never hit a good shot after you mentioned that 54 .
all i made was fives .
there's a lesson there .
you know ...
i don't care if i start out with four fives .
i simply figure i've used up my quota , and i forget about them .
and i go on .
i don't always hit the ball straight .
but you know what i've learned?
three bad shots and one good one still make par .
golf is a game of recovery .
you're gonna make one hell of a pro .
you got that swing , and you got the name .
crowd loves you .
with the war ending , the tournaments will start up again , and sky's the limit .
i'm not gonna turn pro .
i signed up for georgia tech this fall .
really?
school is nice , i guess ... but isn't the point of it all to make a nice , big bag of money?
not just .
i want to get an education .
i think that's important .
can i ask you a question?
why do you play golf?
'cause i love it .
and i want to win .
do you know why i play golf?
for the money .
i have to win .
which is why , whenever you come up against me ...
i'm gonna beat you .
i'll beat you .
thank you .
hello , george .
good morning , mary .
may i have a coca cola , please?
you surely may .
here you go .
thank you .
these are the worst conditions i've ever seen .
have some coffee .
thanks .
brought some local papers there .
what are they saying?
a lot of the folks are picking us to win ... even though this herron fellow is a member here .
they say rob's strokes are absolutely brilliant .
they're still harping on his temper , though .
his " smoldering wrath , " as one of them called it .
i don't know what i'll do with him .
maybe you could talk to him .
what am i gonna say to him?
the way i see it , he's trying to please you , his mother ... and the whole damn city of atlanta .
throwing clubs may be the only thing he has to relieve the pressure .
where is he now?
he's making a telephone call .
his mother?
i don't think so .
alexa?
no .
it's a couple more days and then we'll take the train back home .
i can't wait to see you again .
is your father still sitting there?
yes .
i'm sorry ... about your bad weather , that is .
i hope it changes soon .
me , too .
when i get back i thought maybe you'd like to come to dinner .
meet my folks .
yes , that would be real nice .
i'd better go .
yes , you , too .
yes , me , too .
goodbye .
robert jones?
yes , daddy .
i don't know him .
he goes to tech .
he knows matt and john .
ls he catholic?
daddy  ls he?
no , he isn't .
what have i told you about that?
judge not , lest ye be judged .
and where is he that the weather is so bad?
you were listening to my conversation?
i'm sitting right here .
he's playing a golf tournament .
in oakmont , pennsylvania , if you must know .
the us amateur?
yes .
that was bobby jones on the telephone?
he prefers bob .
ls he winning?
he's in the finals .
o. b. , he's gonna win this damn thing .
i can feel it .
a national championship .
quiet .
fore !
what in the hell are you doing?
somebody moved .
are you mad?
it's all right .
now boarding , track three , local , homestead ...
richvale , rankin , bradley .
don't tell your old man .
i guess this is your runner up year .
you've come second in four tournaments in a row .
that megaphone .
the megaphone didn't beat me .
davey herron did .
i lost 13 pounds in that match , o. b. 13 pounds .
i can play 36 holes in the hot sun at home ... and never lose but a pound or two .
i've just got to learn to manage it better .
i keep making stupid mistakes .
good judgment comes from experience ...
and a lot of that comes from bad judgment .
it's true .
i never learned anything from a tournament i won .
lf you can keep your head when all about you
are losing theirs
lf you can meet with triumph and disaster
and treat those two impostors just the same
lf you can fill the unforgiving minute
with sixty seconds 'worth of distance run
yours is the earth and everything that's in it
and which is more
you will be a man my son
hell , just keep it .
hi , bobby .
hello .
who's that?
i have no idea .
hello , everybody .
hey , bobby .
this is mary malone .
hi .
mary .
alexa .
nice to meet you .
how do you do?
do you play golf , mary?
no , i don't .
well , gang , today is january 15 , 1920 .
remember it well .
it is the last day we can drink legally .
there's no way prohibition can last .
i read an article in vanity fair .
it said we're going on " the gaudiest spree in history .
they call this the jazz age .
here's to jazz , then .
and opera .
and georgia tech golf .
and friends .
hi , bobby .
hello .
we're having a party at our house .
you want to come by?
i'm with someone .
thank you .
what's your girlfriend's name?
we could call her marigold , because that's what she's trying to do .
are you sure she's your type?
that's enough .
she doesn't drink , she doesn't pet , she hasn't been to college yet .
bobby jones !
i want to buy you a drink .
i have one , thank you .
what you drinking?
it looks like beer .
waitress !
excuse me .
waitress , two beers .
mary !
don't just sit there .
go after her .
wait .
let me go .
no .
i'm going home .
i don't play golf .
i don't go to college and i don't drink .
lf that's what you want  i don't care about any of that .
i didn't know you were famous when i met you .
i just knew that you were sweet .
maybe you need to find somebody who can
i have found somebody .
bonny bobby , is it?
my name's angus .
i'll be your caddy .
it's a pleasure to meet you , angus .
that's harry vardon .
mr. vardon , i'm bob jones .
how do you do?
it's a dream come true ... to play with you here at the open .
i saw you at an exhibition at the east lake golf club when i was a boy .
really?
yeah .
now on the tee , from the united states amateur ...
robert tyre jones , jr .
bitch .
mr. vardon , you ever seen a worse shot than that?
no .
