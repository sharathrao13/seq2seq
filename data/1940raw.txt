wait .
fire !
forward .
poor bastards .
they didn't stand a chance .
my dear gilda ... yesterday , in an ambush behind the enemy lines ...
i killed a young nationalist soldier .
how inadequate those words seem .
he was clutching a locket when he died ... with a photograph of a young woman .
i suppose , as i write this , she's waiting for news of him ... hoping against hope he is safe .
dearest gilda ... still no word from you , which breaks my heart .
i know that to you all wars are useless ... and for us to risk our lives is a betrayal ... of ourselves and of you .
but my country's a part of me .
and if i was not here , i would be betraying myself ... and even more , my brother .
believe me ... my being here does not mean i love you any less .
forgive me if you can ... and know that i think of you all the time .
i wonder if you are writing to either of us .
but i do beg you , at least , to write to guy .
his unit is at teruel ... where the fighting is especially bitter ... and made worse by the intense cold .
i can't stay .
we're operating in a few moments .
i know .
we treated men from your unit a few days ago .
that's how i knew you were here .
i asked about you .
they said you have no nerves .
you're always the quiet one in the center of the storm .
if i am , it's because i'm too tired to be frightened .
when do you finish your shift?
we never know .
where are you tonight?
not far from here .
it's an old tannery .
i know it .
if i can , i'll come .
you must be dead on your feet .
no .
i have a secret weapon .
it's strong enough to help you forget what you've seen during the day .
have you heard from her?
i've had other letters , but none from her .
and you?
no .
why won't she write?
she loves you more than she'll ever admit .
and one day you'll be together again , i know it .
these last few days , i've been asking myself if any of this is worth it .
perhaps she was right .
the world should be left to look after itself .
you know you don't believe that .
but what are we achieving?
with the germans and the ltalians on their side , it's only a matter of time .
in that time , maybe the rest of the world will begin to realize what's happening .
you were always the sensible one .
was l?
not in my choice of men , remember?
we should try to sleep .
you know , gilda once said we two should have a child .
you know she and i were lovers?
i knew underneath .
i wanted to tell you , but she always said you were too british .
she was probably right .
those were the happiest times of my life ... the three of us together .
and you and i came here .
we had no choice .
how can i be so tired ... and still feel jealous?
i was jealous of you all the time .
she'd be pleased .
everything needs her blessing .
here's your lift .
my doctor friend .
he's convinced i'm some kind of saint because i never go with anyone .
he was so relieved when i said i wanted to come and see you .
he insisted on giving me a lift himself .
i finally got rid of my halo .
there is no second sight .
we grope towards our future blind .
it's kinder that way .
on the morning of her final day , she came to her death clear eyed ... brave , unknowing .
and when the snow melts , spring has come .
there is an end to war .
one small flower ... blessed , unique ... will flower no more .
gilda ...
i have to tell you that our dear friend is dead .
i saw her just before it happened .
she was so beautiful ... and had become so wise .
far stronger than me .
a few months later , as the forces of the republic began to disintegrate ...
i crossed back into france with the remnants of my unit .
all our efforts had come to nothing .
the war in spain was lost .
i am speaking to you from the cabinet room ... at 10 downing street .
this morning , the british ambassador in berlin ... handed the german government a final note ... stating that unless we heard from them by 1 1 : 00 ... that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from poland ... a state of war would exist between us .
i have to tell you now ... that no such undertaking has been received ... and that consequently ... this country is at war with germany .
the war against the fascists in spain was only a rehearsal .
the greater struggle was about to begin .
less than a year later ...
poland , norway , holland , belgium , and france were overrun ... and the germans entered paris .
i doubted i would ever see her again .
my war was in the field of intelligence .
and early in 1944 ...
i was sent to establish links with resistance fighters ... based in the countryside near la manche .
in the late spring , i was transferred to paris .
six long years had passed since i was last there .
my cover was as an official working for a firm manufacturing rolling stock ... for the hard pressed french railways .
and some time after i arrived , i was waiting for a rendezvous .
did she see me?
i wasn't sure .
but after the initial shock , how could i be surprised?
gilda didn't see the world as others did .
she was looking after herself ... making sure she could live in the style she was accustomed to .
bravo .
stop !
three mornings i sat across the road waiting for you .
you mustn't come again .
he could come here at any time , and everyone watches .
they'll have seen you come into the building ... the patron and his wife from the cafe .
yeah , well , they don't think much of you there .
of course not .
and you don't care?
did i ever care what people thought of me?
i'd like to believe that once you cared what i thought .
why , gilda?
why this?
i never much liked my own company , you know that .
yeah , but with one of them?
it's just a game .
not now .
i'm glad you're alive .
you know about mia?
she loved you , you know?
as much as i did .
you should go .
we could leave paris .
make our way to the coast .
i have the papers .
don't be absurd .
are you in love with him?
this german?
or is it just a convenience?
a business arrangement , like with max?
for the duration of the exhibition?
the duration of the war?
go out the back way .
when we were making love just then , you felt it as strongly as i did .
yes .
our bodies were always good together .
forget about me , guy ... as i have you .
you're out of my life now .
hello , sir .
when they told me you'd been sitting at a cafe three mornings in a row ...
i didn't believe them .
now i find it's because you were waiting to see an old girlfriend .
a girlfriend who happens to be hobnobbing with a german officer .
do you realize the risk you're taking?
the risk you're taking with all of us here?
you're lucky you didn't wake up with your throat cut .
did you know she was involved with a german?
yes , sir .
and yet you still went to see her?
i've known her a long time .
i've a good mind to have london pull you out .
they won't have it , because there's no one with your credentials ... can come in at this short notice .
i won't be seeing her again .
lf you do , i'll kill you myself .
you're so beautiful .
it was the right size , yes?
i feel very special .
one day , i will get you stockings .
when the war is over .
when the war is over .
i want to speak your language .
you promised you'd teach me .
but we have our own private language , you and l .
and when the allies win the war ... we'll all be speaking english in our sleep .
to think , if i had been at cambridge one year later ... we might have met then .
here we go again .
you seem a little far away tonight .
i'm here .
i wonder who's getting it tonight .
you were good at the meeting .
you got it just right .
i'm sorry i followed you that day .
no , you had every reason .
i know what it's like to love someone .
thank you .
why do you let them insult you?
if our roles were reversed and this was berlin ... you'd find yourself doing the same .
and expect to be punished .
i'm angry because
i don't want anything to spoil tonight of all nights .
why tonight?
because ....
because it's your birthday .
you've always refused to tell me , my darling .
and i know it's a woman's prerogative ... but i wanted to know so we could celebrate .
forgive me , i checked your papers .
my puppet , you're upset?
but why?
thirty three .
i thought 28 at most .
open it .
please?
so we're on standby .
go down to the lavatories and put on the clothes there ...
my love .
they picked up the man you were meeting , bisquet .
how did you
there's a bicycle outside .
you have about two minutes .
remember cambridge?
the next morning?
how i dressed like a boy?
gilda .
i had no idea it would be you .
give me 30 seconds .
what happened?
bisquet was picked up last night .
we just found out .
who tipped you off?
the woman i went to see .
this is a surprise .
i thought you were on alert .
we've been stood down .
there's a storm in the channel .
no invasion in this weather .
how was your day?
puzzling .
frustrating .
but not anymore .
i was elated .
in some way , somehow , she was on our side .
d day .
for a few days i was looked after by the priest .
and then i was flown back to hospital in england .
i still had no clear idea of gilda's involvement in the resistance .
all i knew was that in spite of everything ... when the war was over , we would be together again ... as mia had foretold .
the major will see you now , sir .
just wait here for a moment , please .
long time , guy .
it is , sir .
the first contact didn't come from our side .
she approached us .
in fact , it was more than a year before i discovered who she was .
when i realized it was gilda ...
i was as surprised as i'm sure you were .
although i suppose you knew her better than i ever did .
her first lover worked in stulpnagel's offices .
she copied documents from his briefcase with a miniature camera .
she's good with cameras .
then passed them on through her contact in a beauty salon .
the intelligence officer she's with now is much more circumspect .
but one tip off she gave us ... saved an entire escape line from infiltration .
and when you went to see her , you were putting all that at risk .
why didn't she tell me?
you know why .
if you were caught and tortured ....
it wasn't just for your own good .
paris is in chaos .
the resistance is trying to liberate the city themselves ... and there's no possible justification for sending you back there .
but she is very resourceful , as we both know .
i wouldn't worry about her too much .
it's not the germans i'm worried about .
of course , if you were to go of your own accord ...
i wouldn't do anything to stop you .
you got my message?
i'm not coming with you .
have you seen the people out there?
i'll be all right if i stay here .
when the allies come
why will you not come with me?
i can take you to germany .
i know it won't be easy , but at least you'll be safe .
i don't love you , frans .
oh , god !
no !
well , my love , i'm trying to make sense of things ... of how i was , and how i am now .
well , my love , i'm trying to make sense of things ... of how i was , and how i am now .
i have always believed our first duty is to ourselves ... to live life to the full .
but i have also been haunted by another conviction ... that everything is preordained , lying in wait ... and time is running out .
i seem to have charged through my life in a kind of panic .
and looking back ...
i feel i have achieved little of worth beyond our friendship : yours and mine , and mia's .
then one day i woke ... and found i had lost the two people i cared for most .
only then did i begin to realize that we cannot live alone , aloof from the world ... and that to believe we cannot fight against fate is an act of surrender .
you were right when you said that once i cared for your opinion of me ... but wrong in thinking i ever stopped caring .
i love you .
